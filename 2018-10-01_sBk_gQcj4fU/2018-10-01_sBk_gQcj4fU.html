    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=0.131s">I</a>  think that we can call the meeting to order now. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=2.272s">It</a>  is about 634. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=4.552s">This</a>  is the meeting of the Community Preservation Committee at the Medford High School Media Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=12.994s">This</a>  is the first evening of presentations for the second round of Community Preservation Act projects for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=24.878s">Before</a>  we get started, I wanted to remind everyone that there are materials outside the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=32.369s">We</a>  welcome public comment on the projects that are presented both this week and next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=39.859s">And</a>  those comments can be submitted on index cards that are provided outside the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=47.123s">We</a>  have posters that you can write on, as well, to sign your name or write some comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=53.747s">And</a>  if people are watching this recorded from home, we welcome emails to be sent to our coordinator, Danielle Evans. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=64.713s">The</a>  community preservation coordinator, you can find her information on the community preservation committee's website, either the city website or preservemedford.org. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=78.18s">I</a>  think that is it for the reminders for this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=84.783s">The</a>  first item in our agenda is to review and accept the minutes from July 10 and August 14 meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=97.527s">Is</a>  there a motion to accept the minutes?</p>

    <p>[Heidi Davis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=101.088s">I</a>  just want to note that I did send Danielle an email about a typo.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=105.489s">I'll</a>  make a motion to approve both minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=108.19s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=111.547s">All</a>  in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=112.107s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=115.29s">The</a>  minutes are approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=117.551s">And</a>  so next on the agenda is to invite our first applicant to come up and you can stand at the podium and we will have some images so that we can see your project as you're presenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=135.904s">The</a>  first applicant is the Mystic River Watershed Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=140.568s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=142.754s">Can</a>  you clarify what the people at home are seeing? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=145.796s">Are</a>  they seeing what's on the screen?</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=147.797s">I</a>  believe that they are seeing what's on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=151.98s">I</a>  think that that's at the discretion of the recording, but they should be able to see what's on the screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=159.865s">Sorry,</a>  just one moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=162.026s">Our</a>  format will be to give you about five to ten minutes to present, explain your project, and then committee members <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=172.773s">We'll</a>  ask questions, and then we can entertain questions from the members of the public as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=179.14s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=179.6s">So,</a>  introduce yourself, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=180.982s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=182.003s">Hi,</a>  everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=182.603s">My</a>  name is Amber Christopherson. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=184.265s">I'm</a>  the Greenways Director at the Mystic River Watershed Association. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=187.488s">I'm</a>  not sure I'm supposed to address you guys or the audience, but I'll try to kind of do both. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=194.395s">Great,</a>  so thanks for getting me first on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=196.816s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=197.916s">And</a>  we'll kick off the presentations for the next two days, I guess. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=202.997s">So</a>  a little bit about our organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=205.478s">The</a>  Mystic River Watershed Association has been around since 1972. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=209.539s">We</a>  work to protect, enhance, and restore the Mystic River, the tributaries, and the watershed lands within the Mystic River Watershed, which is 21 cities and towns, about 600,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=222.222s">And</a>  so we work with thousands of volunteers a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=225.245s">I</a>  myself am a landscape architect, and I lead our participatory design and public outreach components at MIRA related to the Greenways Initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=233.452s">So</a>  this map summarizes the scope of our work and our vision, which is for 25 miles of connected linear parks from the Mystic Lakes down to Boston Harbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=243.78s">And</a>  that's what I'm here to talk about today, is an effort to improve the shoreline linear park for the Mystic Lakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=251.267s">So</a>  how many folks here have been to the Mystic Lakes? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=254.59s">I</a>  assume most folks, if you live in Medford, I hope you've experienced them. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=258.154s">And</a>  we do a lot of work there related to the herring migration every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=261.998s">We</a>  do a lot of activity at the dam. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=264.44s">And</a>  so maybe we'll go to the next slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=267.883s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=268.623s">So</a>  this kind of shows the scope of our work, which on the map on the left is showing a one mile segment along Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=277.367s">That</a>  right now is a series of kind of desire lines. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=280.689s">So</a>  it's dirt paths where you can see people have <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=284.097s">run,</a>  walk, maybe bike on the dirt part, I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=287.72s">I</a>  think most bikers tend to use the shoulder there to move up and down that length of road. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=294.985s">And</a>  so our proposal is to create or take on a feasibility and concept design for the shared use path, looking at how to make it a more accessible path for people walking, biking, anything on wheels. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=309.797s">along</a>  this one mile road, and also to look at potential overlooks and vistas so people can interact with the lakes a little bit better. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=317.043s">The</a>  map I'm showing on the right is relevant in the sense, if you look up here, <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=324.752s">Actually</a>  three years now, DCR took on something called the Urban Path and Parkways Study, which the scope is shown there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=331.498s">And</a>  it was looking at parkways that DCR owns that lack the appropriate biking and pedestrian accommodation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=338.805s">So</a>  this segment is actually part of that study, which is being released later this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=343.309s">So</a>  it's good timing in the sense that DCR has looked at very high-level recommendations for how these parkways <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=349.454s">can</a>  better accommodate walking and biking, and this would be a follow-up to those recommendations to move towards implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=358.112s">So</a>  let me see what I have in my notes here. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=360.113s">A</a>  little bit about the community process. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=363.714s">One</a>  thing that our organization has been doing is utilizing CPA and other communities to move our Greenways vision forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=370.896s">So</a>  to date we've received $450,000 between Arlington and Somerville CPA to do very similar work where we're taking <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=379.818s">Kind</a>  of what's been studied very high level in some sort of master plan that the state or city has taken on and say, let's take this idea and recommendation to study this area more and move it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=391.048s">And</a>  so we're using a similar model here where we're proposing a $60,000 proposal to kind of take the first chunk. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=398.495s">of</a>  this longer-term capital project and start to build a vision, do community outreach, and that's really what we lead with in all communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=408.324s">So</a>  this will be built on robust engagement with the community that includes site walks, public workshops, online surveys, kind of a range of different <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=420.375s">community</a>  outreach that reaches, you know, in some ways we target at Butters, the people that live right there, and then also just broadly the Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=431.123s">And</a>  then just for a side note, I'll show a couple images, then I'll talk about DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=436.469s">There's</a>  just an image of people running in the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=439.911s">I</a>  think some people like to run on dirt, but not everyone does. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=444.655s">And</a>  that's one thing that this first phase of design will take on is, what will the surface be? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=451.82s">Will</a>  it be stone dust? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=452.941s">You</a>  have to think about erosion, slopes, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=458.005s">and</a>  what can accommodate the wheel components. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=461.11s">I</a>  think that's really what's lacking here is it's hard to get strollers, wheelchairs, bikes close to the lakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=467.34s">And</a>  then the next slide shows just, oh. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=471.888s">Oh,</a>  you did? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=472.288s">Oh,</a>  that's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=473.048s">There</a>  was just one other image of sort of what could be further leverage, which was a tiny view through the trees of the sailboats, and not exactly a place where you can physically get to the water's edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=484.17s">So</a>  I think that's something that this would look at, hence why we're calling it a linear park, because it's more than just a walking and biking trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=490.111s">It</a>  also includes that open space component. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=495.032s">So</a>  as far as working with DCR, this is something that we've been building a relationship for <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=500.193s">I've</a>  been at Myra doing this work for two and a half years, and so typically what we do is say, hey, DCR, we have a chance to get some local funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=509.197s">We'll</a>  take this on. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=510.238s">We</a>  work with DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=511.078s">We</a>  include them on the steering committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=512.999s">We</a>  help them draft the RFP to select the consultant and kind of push them that way and add <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=518.902s">to</a>  their capacity of what they're able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=521.644s">I</a>  know that there were some questions sent to me earlier about, like, are there matching funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=525.586s">How</a>  are we going to handle construction in the future? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=527.408s">Because</a>  it is a longer-term process, a project like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=532.411s">And</a>  typically what has kicked it off in other communities is always the CPA funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=536.874s">And</a>  it's that seed funding that really allows us to understand the technical issues, understand the community needs and ideas and potentially roadblocks, and then move it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=548.001s">What</a>  we've been doing with DCR is laying out, OK, for the next three to five years, where can we fit this project in the capital, your capital plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=556.525s">And</a>  the other thing that's recently happened that's really great is Governor Baker has committed to the recreational trails program. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=563.449s">And</a>  the funding for that has doubled in the last few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=566.691s">And</a>  so kind of getting in on that state funding could be huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=571.213s">And</a>  what we found is <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=574.034s">For</a>  example, in Arlington, we have CPA funding to do a linear park and park redesign process that we were at schematic design in the spring and then the state MVP funding came out and we jumped on that and we got $400,000 to build a part of the park because there were flooding issues, so we tied it in with climate resiliency. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=595.179s">You</a>  kind of never know where the funding might come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=597.742s">I</a>  think the city kind of has to be a key player in saying we're committed to this and trying to get the state to come along. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=604.99s">The</a>  fact that it is part of the state's priority in some way, in this case related to the parkway, is a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=612.938s">DCR</a>  has also committed to this Mystic Greenways effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=617.403s">I</a>  don't know if you guys have heard of the Clipper Ship Connector, I hope you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=620.707s">We've</a>  been working with the city and the state on that project to build a gap in the network right near Medford Square so that people can stay along the river and continuously run, walk, bike. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=630.859s">the</a>  Mystic, Alewife, Mystic Lakes, all the way to the Malden River. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=634.765s">So</a>  that's what that regional map was showing that this is a part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=637.989s">So</a>  I think that's it in a nutshell. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=641.494s">There</a>  was a question maybe about DEP stormwater requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=644.919s">I</a>  don't know if I should just jump into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=647.481s">So</a>  in this case, there's no specific outfalls that we'll be addressing, but there are inherent stormwater issues, and because this is likely in, well, it's in the floodplain, it'll be subject to the Wetlands and Riverfront Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=662.349s">And</a>  we'll be working closely with the Conservation Commission in Medford to look at what requirements we need to meet for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=668.111s">There</a>  are existing erosion issues that we hope this path can solve, actually, as far as stormwater is concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=674.234s">And</a>  we will be looking at, again, surface treatments around what's better for runoff, but what can withstand the sort of use levels that we anticipate. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=684.017s">And</a>  what will come out of this first phase is identifying all the permitting that will be necessary in future. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=692.64s">as</a>  the project moves through the design phase. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=697.002s">So,</a>  I think that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=698.502s">Hopefully</a>  I didn't go too far over my time. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=701.143s">That's</a>  fine, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Roberta Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=703.524s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=704.564s">Are</a>  there questions from the committee?</p>

    <p>[Heidi Davis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=707.605s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=708.425s">Since</a>  you just spoke to stormwater, I'll just jump right in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=711.746s">Are</a>  you planning to have impervious or pervious pavement?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=715.078s">Well,</a>  that's what I was just saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=715.979s">I</a>  think we haven't decided what the surface would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=718.26s">I</a>  got a couple estimates from engineering firms who have done similar types of projects, and they basically walked the site once, and were like, I could see stone dust being a nice alternative, because what DCR is doing a lot of now is the paths that are closest to the river are a little bit more natural, so there's stone dust, they're slightly pervious. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=737.614s">You</a>  just have to be wary of where rutting out might happen.</p>

    <p>[Heidi Davis]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=741.837s">But</a>  there is a... <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=743.898s">There</a>  is something between stone dust and pavement. <a href="https://youtu.be/sBk_gQcj4fU&t=746.02s">There</a>  is porous pavement.</p>
