1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:02,252
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that we can call the meeting to order now.

2
00:00:02,272 --> 00:00:04,512
[SPEAKER_14]: It is about 634.

3
00:00:04,552 --> 00:00:12,554
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the meeting of the Community Preservation Committee at the Medford High School Media Center.

4
00:00:12,994 --> 00:00:23,617
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the first evening of presentations for the second round of Community Preservation Act projects for this year.

5
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:31,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Before we get started, I wanted to remind everyone that there are materials outside the door.

6
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:38,959
[SPEAKER_14]: We welcome public comment on the projects that are presented both this week and next week.

7
00:00:39,859 --> 00:00:46,943
[SPEAKER_14]: And those comments can be submitted on index cards that are provided outside the door.

8
00:00:47,123 --> 00:00:52,867
[SPEAKER_14]: We have posters that you can write on, as well, to sign your name or write some comments.

9
00:00:53,747 --> 00:01:03,473
[SPEAKER_14]: And if people are watching this recorded from home, we welcome emails to be sent to our coordinator, Danielle Evans.

10
00:01:04,713 --> 00:01:18,100
[SPEAKER_14]: The community preservation coordinator, you can find her information on the community preservation committee's website, either the city website or preservemedford.org.

11
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,822
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that is it for the reminders for this evening.

12
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:36,606
[SPEAKER_14]: The first item in our agenda is to review and accept the minutes from July 10 and August 14 meetings.

13
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:40,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion to accept the minutes?

14
00:01:41,088 --> 00:01:44,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to note that I did send Danielle an email about a typo.

15
00:01:45,489 --> 00:01:47,909
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make a motion to approve both minutes.

16
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:48,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

17
00:01:51,547 --> 00:01:52,087
[SPEAKER_14]: All in favor?

18
00:01:52,107 --> 00:01:52,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

19
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,370
[SPEAKER_14]: The minutes are approved.

20
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:15,864
[SPEAKER_14]: And so next on the agenda is to invite our first applicant to come up and you can stand at the podium and we will have some images so that we can see your project as you're presenting.

21
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:19,007
[SPEAKER_14]: The first applicant is the Mystic River Watershed Association.

22
00:02:20,568 --> 00:02:20,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

23
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:25,276
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you clarify what the people at home are seeing?

24
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:26,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Are they seeing what's on the screen?

25
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:31,139
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that they are seeing what's on the screen.

26
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,864
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that that's at the discretion of the recording, but they should be able to see what's on the screen.

27
00:02:39,865 --> 00:02:40,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, just one moment.

28
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:51,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Our format will be to give you about five to ten minutes to present, explain your project, and then committee members

29
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:58,219
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll ask questions, and then we can entertain questions from the members of the public as well.

30
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

31
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,962
[SPEAKER_14]: So, introduce yourself, please.

32
00:03:00,982 --> 00:03:01,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

33
00:03:02,003 --> 00:03:02,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, everyone.

34
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:04,225
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Amber Christopherson.

35
00:03:04,265 --> 00:03:07,468
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the Greenways Director at the Mystic River Watershed Association.

36
00:03:07,488 --> 00:03:12,313
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure I'm supposed to address you guys or the audience, but I'll try to kind of do both.

37
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Great, so thanks for getting me first on the agenda.

38
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:17,596
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate that.

39
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:21,677
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll kick off the presentations for the next two days, I guess.

40
00:03:22,997 --> 00:03:25,418
[SPEAKER_13]: So a little bit about our organization.

41
00:03:25,478 --> 00:03:29,079
[SPEAKER_13]: The Mystic River Watershed Association has been around since 1972.

42
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:40,602
[SPEAKER_13]: We work to protect, enhance, and restore the Mystic River, the tributaries, and the watershed lands within the Mystic River Watershed, which is 21 cities and towns, about 600,000 people.

43
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,004
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we work with thousands of volunteers a year.

44
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:53,412
[SPEAKER_13]: I myself am a landscape architect, and I lead our participatory design and public outreach components at MIRA related to the Greenways Initiative.

45
00:03:53,452 --> 00:04:03,000
[SPEAKER_13]: So this map summarizes the scope of our work and our vision, which is for 25 miles of connected linear parks from the Mystic Lakes down to Boston Harbor.

46
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,547
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what I'm here to talk about today, is an effort to improve the shoreline linear park for the Mystic Lakes.

47
00:04:11,267 --> 00:04:13,429
[SPEAKER_13]: So how many folks here have been to the Mystic Lakes?

48
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,094
[SPEAKER_13]: I assume most folks, if you live in Medford, I hope you've experienced them.

49
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:21,977
[SPEAKER_13]: And we do a lot of work there related to the herring migration every year.

50
00:04:21,998 --> 00:04:23,699
[SPEAKER_13]: We do a lot of activity at the dam.

51
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,703
[SPEAKER_13]: And so maybe we'll go to the next slide.

52
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:28,243
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.

53
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:36,547
[SPEAKER_13]: So this kind of shows the scope of our work, which on the map on the left is showing a one mile segment along Mystic Valley Parkway.

54
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:40,529
[SPEAKER_13]: That right now is a series of kind of desire lines.

55
00:04:40,689 --> 00:04:43,370
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's dirt paths where you can see people have

56
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:47,700
[SPEAKER_13]: run, walk, maybe bike on the dirt part, I'm not sure.

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:54,825
[SPEAKER_13]: I think most bikers tend to use the shoulder there to move up and down that length of road.

58
00:04:54,985 --> 00:05:08,095
[SPEAKER_13]: And so our proposal is to create or take on a feasibility and concept design for the shared use path, looking at how to make it a more accessible path for people walking, biking, anything on wheels.

59
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:17,023
[SPEAKER_13]: along this one mile road, and also to look at potential overlooks and vistas so people can interact with the lakes a little bit better.

60
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:21,367
[SPEAKER_13]: The map I'm showing on the right is relevant in the sense, if you look up here,

61
00:05:24,752 --> 00:05:30,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually three years now, DCR took on something called the Urban Path and Parkways Study, which the scope is shown there.

62
00:05:31,498 --> 00:05:38,745
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was looking at parkways that DCR owns that lack the appropriate biking and pedestrian accommodation.

63
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:43,249
[SPEAKER_13]: So this segment is actually part of that study, which is being released later this fall.

64
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:48,834
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's good timing in the sense that DCR has looked at very high-level recommendations for how these parkways

65
00:05:49,454 --> 00:05:55,595
[SPEAKER_13]: can better accommodate walking and biking, and this would be a follow-up to those recommendations to move towards implementation.

66
00:05:58,112 --> 00:06:00,093
[SPEAKER_13]: So let me see what I have in my notes here.

67
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:03,614
[SPEAKER_13]: A little bit about the community process.

68
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:10,816
[SPEAKER_13]: One thing that our organization has been doing is utilizing CPA and other communities to move our Greenways vision forward.

69
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:19,118
[SPEAKER_13]: So to date we've received $450,000 between Arlington and Somerville CPA to do very similar work where we're taking

70
00:06:19,818 --> 00:06:30,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Kind of what's been studied very high level in some sort of master plan that the state or city has taken on and say, let's take this idea and recommendation to study this area more and move it forward.

71
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:37,694
[SPEAKER_13]: And so we're using a similar model here where we're proposing a $60,000 proposal to kind of take the first chunk.

72
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:48,244
[SPEAKER_13]: of this longer-term capital project and start to build a vision, do community outreach, and that's really what we lead with in all communities.

73
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:59,174
[SPEAKER_13]: So this will be built on robust engagement with the community that includes site walks, public workshops, online surveys, kind of a range of different

74
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:09,702
[SPEAKER_13]: community outreach that reaches, you know, in some ways we target at Butters, the people that live right there, and then also just broadly the Medford community.

75
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:15,386
[SPEAKER_13]: And then just for a side note, I'll show a couple images, then I'll talk about DCR.

76
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:19,031
[SPEAKER_13]: There's just an image of people running in the road.

77
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:23,974
[SPEAKER_13]: I think some people like to run on dirt, but not everyone does.

78
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:31,780
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's one thing that this first phase of design will take on is, what will the surface be?

79
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Will it be stone dust?

80
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:36,403
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to think about erosion, slopes, things like that.

81
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:41,070
[SPEAKER_13]: and what can accommodate the wheel components.

82
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:46,579
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's really what's lacking here is it's hard to get strollers, wheelchairs, bikes close to the lakes.

83
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,425
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the next slide shows just, oh.

84
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:52,228
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you did?

85
00:07:52,288 --> 00:07:52,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, that's okay.

86
00:07:53,048 --> 00:08:04,150
[SPEAKER_13]: There was just one other image of sort of what could be further leverage, which was a tiny view through the trees of the sailboats, and not exactly a place where you can physically get to the water's edge.

87
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:10,071
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's something that this would look at, hence why we're calling it a linear park, because it's more than just a walking and biking trail.

88
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:13,772
[SPEAKER_13]: It also includes that open space component.

89
00:08:15,032 --> 00:08:18,953
[SPEAKER_13]: So as far as working with DCR, this is something that we've been building a relationship for

90
00:08:20,193 --> 00:08:28,897
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been at Myra doing this work for two and a half years, and so typically what we do is say, hey, DCR, we have a chance to get some local funding.

91
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:30,158
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll take this on.

92
00:08:30,238 --> 00:08:31,058
[SPEAKER_13]: We work with DCR.

93
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,579
[SPEAKER_13]: We include them on the steering committee.

94
00:08:32,999 --> 00:08:38,522
[SPEAKER_13]: We help them draft the RFP to select the consultant and kind of push them that way and add

95
00:08:38,902 --> 00:08:40,623
[SPEAKER_13]: to their capacity of what they're able to do.

96
00:08:41,644 --> 00:08:45,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that there were some questions sent to me earlier about, like, are there matching funds?

97
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:47,368
[SPEAKER_13]: How are we going to handle construction in the future?

98
00:08:47,408 --> 00:08:51,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it is a longer-term process, a project like this.

99
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:56,634
[SPEAKER_13]: And typically what has kicked it off in other communities is always the CPA funding.

100
00:08:56,874 --> 00:09:06,560
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's that seed funding that really allows us to understand the technical issues, understand the community needs and ideas and potentially roadblocks, and then move it forward.

101
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:14,885
[SPEAKER_13]: What we've been doing with DCR is laying out, OK, for the next three to five years, where can we fit this project in the capital, your capital plan?

102
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:23,369
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other thing that's recently happened that's really great is Governor Baker has committed to the recreational trails program.

103
00:09:23,449 --> 00:09:26,471
[SPEAKER_13]: And the funding for that has doubled in the last few years.

104
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:31,093
[SPEAKER_13]: And so kind of getting in on that state funding could be huge.

105
00:09:31,213 --> 00:09:32,214
[SPEAKER_13]: And what we found is

106
00:09:34,034 --> 00:09:53,879
[SPEAKER_13]: For example, in Arlington, we have CPA funding to do a linear park and park redesign process that we were at schematic design in the spring and then the state MVP funding came out and we jumped on that and we got $400,000 to build a part of the park because there were flooding issues, so we tied it in with climate resiliency.

107
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,682
[SPEAKER_13]: You kind of never know where the funding might come from.

108
00:09:57,742 --> 00:10:03,088
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the city kind of has to be a key player in saying we're committed to this and trying to get the state to come along.

109
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:11,296
[SPEAKER_13]: The fact that it is part of the state's priority in some way, in this case related to the parkway, is a good thing.

110
00:10:12,938 --> 00:10:16,442
[SPEAKER_13]: DCR has also committed to this Mystic Greenways effort.

111
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:20,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if you guys have heard of the Clipper Ship Connector, I hope you have.

112
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:29,818
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been working with the city and the state on that project to build a gap in the network right near Medford Square so that people can stay along the river and continuously run, walk, bike.

113
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:34,725
[SPEAKER_13]: the Mystic, Alewife, Mystic Lakes, all the way to the Malden River.

114
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:37,909
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what that regional map was showing that this is a part of.

115
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:40,713
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's it in a nutshell.

116
00:10:41,494 --> 00:10:44,278
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a question maybe about DEP stormwater requirements.

117
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,300
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if I should just jump into that.

118
00:10:47,481 --> 00:11:01,669
[SPEAKER_13]: So in this case, there's no specific outfalls that we'll be addressing, but there are inherent stormwater issues, and because this is likely in, well, it's in the floodplain, it'll be subject to the Wetlands and Riverfront Act.

119
00:11:02,349 --> 00:11:07,791
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll be working closely with the Conservation Commission in Medford to look at what requirements we need to meet for that.

120
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:13,713
[SPEAKER_13]: There are existing erosion issues that we hope this path can solve, actually, as far as stormwater is concerned.

121
00:11:14,234 --> 00:11:22,157
[SPEAKER_13]: And we will be looking at, again, surface treatments around what's better for runoff, but what can withstand the sort of use levels that we anticipate.

122
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:31,020
[SPEAKER_13]: And what will come out of this first phase is identifying all the permitting that will be necessary in future.

123
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,261
[SPEAKER_13]: as the project moves through the design phase.

124
00:11:37,002 --> 00:11:38,462
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I think that's it.

125
00:11:38,502 --> 00:11:41,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Hopefully I didn't go too far over my time.

126
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:43,403
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fine, thank you.

127
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:44,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

128
00:11:44,564 --> 00:11:46,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there questions from the committee?

129
00:11:47,605 --> 00:11:47,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

130
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:51,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Since you just spoke to stormwater, I'll just jump right in there.

131
00:11:51,746 --> 00:11:54,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you planning to have impervious or pervious pavement?

132
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:55,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's what I was just saying.

133
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:58,140
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we haven't decided what the surface would be.

134
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:17,054
[SPEAKER_13]: I got a couple estimates from engineering firms who have done similar types of projects, and they basically walked the site once, and were like, I could see stone dust being a nice alternative, because what DCR is doing a lot of now is the paths that are closest to the river are a little bit more natural, so there's stone dust, they're slightly pervious.

135
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:21,437
[SPEAKER_13]: You just have to be wary of where rutting out might happen.

136
00:12:21,837 --> 00:12:22,357
[SPEAKER_06]: But there is a...

137
00:12:23,898 --> 00:12:25,960
[SPEAKER_06]: There is something between stone dust and pavement.

138
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,700
[SPEAKER_06]: There is porous pavement.

139
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and then there's also porous pavement.

140
00:12:28,682 --> 00:12:35,667
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a spectrum, which I would also say every year there's new technologies that DCR has been employing.

141
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:42,051
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, one of the engineering firms, Hatch, that gave us an estimate is working on

142
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:49,898
[SPEAKER_13]: the path that's on top of the MBTA seawall on the Mystic River, like the lower Mystic River connecting Boston and Somerville.

143
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:59,245
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's using a porous pavement, also because there might be some shifting with the seawall, so they're working on the latest technologies related to that.

144
00:12:59,286 --> 00:13:00,386
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's something that

145
00:13:01,227 --> 00:13:14,112
[SPEAKER_13]: this phase would kind of look at and say you know in some ways the the desire lines that people have carved out are showing where the path should probably go but you know it's still worth looking at what's the best alignment.

146
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:19,934
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not just new outfalls that need to meet stormwater standards it's any new impervious surfaces.

147
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:20,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

148
00:13:20,874 --> 00:13:23,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Though I think for pedestrian pathways there's

149
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:25,216
[SPEAKER_06]: There's some kind of exemption.

150
00:13:25,256 --> 00:13:26,016
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember the width.

151
00:13:26,076 --> 00:13:27,097
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be a six-foot width.

152
00:13:27,777 --> 00:13:28,597
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

153
00:13:29,238 --> 00:13:34,621
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was working on this with another project with niche along the river, and there was a long list of the different permitting.

154
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:38,383
[SPEAKER_13]: And in that case, it was more about, is it Chapter 91 DEP?

155
00:13:38,483 --> 00:13:39,823
[SPEAKER_13]: But here, it's not titled.

156
00:13:39,843 --> 00:13:41,544
[SPEAKER_06]: This would clearly need to go before the commission.

157
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:41,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

158
00:13:41,924 --> 00:13:44,566
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really laying out, what are all the permitting issues?

159
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any kind of Army Corps?

160
00:13:45,927 --> 00:13:47,167
[SPEAKER_13]: Because it's in navigable waters.

161
00:13:47,447 --> 00:13:48,108
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't think so here.

162
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:51,966
[SPEAKER_13]: just laying that out and knowing what's ahead of us.

163
00:13:51,986 --> 00:13:57,409
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's also the reason, we've had the question, why not just apply for all the design mending you might need now?

164
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:05,733
[SPEAKER_13]: But we found it's helpful to take it in chunks and then understand where you are to get to the next phase.

165
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:07,594
[SPEAKER_13]: So, thank you.

166
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Doug?

167
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,023
[SPEAKER_17]: A couple of quick questions.

168
00:14:12,164 --> 00:14:20,132
[SPEAKER_17]: You mentioned the path between Whole Foods and Winthrop Street, recently constructed, has been, I think, extremely popular and well used.

169
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:22,054
[SPEAKER_17]: I actually walked it this morning to Medford Square.

170
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:28,902
[SPEAKER_17]: I passed through 200 Canadian geese on the way, which has been, I felt like I was going through Jurassic Park when I did it.

171
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:37,768
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if that informs the surface, but it's kind of a... That's about the vegetation around the path, the plantings.

172
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:40,189
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a lot of lawn there.

173
00:14:40,229 --> 00:14:41,870
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lawn and path at the very edge of the river.

174
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,330
[SPEAKER_13]: It is mostly lawn.

175
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:42,750
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right.

176
00:14:43,011 --> 00:14:44,572
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very popular with the geese.

177
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:50,035
[SPEAKER_17]: But you mentioned about a three to five year potential cycle for construction as a ballpark.

178
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:51,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Towards implementation, yeah.

179
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:58,440
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, it's informed by how we're working with DCR and CPA projects now, and it seems like it's

180
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:12,593
[SPEAKER_13]: Taking, you know, two to three years to design and that includes getting through permitting and during that time It's continuing to look for capital funding and for the projects like this Are they typically funded with a mix of city and state funds?

181
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:12,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

182
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:25,084
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, so your sometimes we'll find private funders if they exist in that area what would you expect Medford to put up as their percentage if you will if you had to just give an estimate based on experience and

183
00:15:26,393 --> 00:15:36,490
[SPEAKER_13]: Frankly we're trying to get the state to pay for more Particularly because we can say look how much the city's already committed from CPA funding, right?

184
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,376
[SPEAKER_13]: My guess is and I feel like you just never know what these projects with

185
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:49,603
[SPEAKER_13]: what the soil comes up with and other challenges, but this will probably be like a million, a million and a half capital funding.

186
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:57,547
[SPEAKER_13]: And the goal would be to try to get that in the state, the state's capital plan.

187
00:15:58,788 --> 00:16:02,831
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think this land was ever built on in Medford's history.

188
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:12,079
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe originally the original 50 acres were actually donated by the Brooks Estate family, which is why it was undeveloped for more than 100 years, I think, at the time.

189
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,903
[SPEAKER_17]: So I guess I'm not expecting what you might find in a lot of urban sites.

190
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:16,804
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I don't think so.

191
00:16:16,824 --> 00:16:20,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Any issues with soil or mitigation or anything like that, I don't believe.

192
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:20,987
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

193
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:25,733
[SPEAKER_13]: And the state typically doesn't do soil testing for contamination.

194
00:16:25,753 --> 00:16:28,095
[SPEAKER_13]: They just pay over parts of it.

195
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:28,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

196
00:16:29,157 --> 00:16:30,318
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're very wary of that.

197
00:16:30,338 --> 00:16:31,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Good to know.

198
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

199
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

200
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:38,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Other questions from the committee?

201
00:16:40,957 --> 00:16:41,957
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a question for you.

202
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:49,682
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that there's a very clear case that this is actually a linear park and not a sidewalk.

203
00:16:50,603 --> 00:16:58,188
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something that we're cognizant that CPA has gotten in trouble in the past for communities that claim that sidewalks are

204
00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:01,072
[SPEAKER_14]: or a recreation feature.

205
00:17:01,713 --> 00:17:13,911
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wonder if you can elaborate a little bit more on what is the separation from the roadway and what is the distinction between this project and a sidewalk?

206
00:17:14,311 --> 00:17:23,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, well I think a very obvious one would be the land ownership there and it being part of the Mystic River Reservation and actually designated as DCR publicly owned land.

207
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,673
[SPEAKER_13]: And even the roadway is owned by DCR.

208
00:17:25,774 --> 00:17:33,495
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you consider the cross section all the way from the existing sidewalk in Medford, which I, along those communities there, I would assume is owned by the city of Medford.

209
00:17:34,635 --> 00:17:40,457
[SPEAKER_13]: And then as soon as you hit the road, which is the parkway, it's owned by DCR and all the way through to the resource area.

210
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:43,522
[SPEAKER_13]: is public land.

211
00:17:43,683 --> 00:17:56,009
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you could also get into, I mean, I think that might be more compelling than the fact that it's recreation and walking and biking and a path with benches, because a sidewalk could have that, I guess, as well.

212
00:17:56,189 --> 00:18:01,011
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think it's a pretty clear-cut situation.

213
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:01,632
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

214
00:18:03,573 --> 00:18:03,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

215
00:18:05,149 --> 00:18:12,836
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other thing I'll say, not to open up a can of worms, but I do know that crosswalks also get, you can't really include crosswalks.

216
00:18:12,876 --> 00:18:22,325
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we can't ignore crosswalks that need to happen because of this path, particularly at High Street and some other, I was gonna say mid-block, mid-lake crossings.

217
00:18:23,246 --> 00:18:29,692
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think we could throw out recommendations for that and not have any issues with is it eligible for CPA funding.

218
00:18:30,132 --> 00:18:36,654
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I imagine that their inclusion in the design is a different level than actually construction.

219
00:18:36,754 --> 00:18:38,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the same thing's happening in Somerville.

220
00:18:38,314 --> 00:18:57,740
[SPEAKER_13]: We're redesigning Blessing of the Bay Park where the boathouse is in Somerville, and that shore drive, well, was owned by DCR, now it's kind of owned by the city of Somerville, so there's a lot of ownership discussions, but it's a similar thing where we're not looking at the crosswalks there, but we did include crosswalks in our design to think about how the community connects to the park.

221
00:18:59,558 --> 00:18:59,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

222
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

223
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Any other questions?

224
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:04,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

225
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:05,305
[SPEAKER_12]: Hold on one second.

226
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:06,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Your name for the record?

227
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:06,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

228
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:06,687
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

229
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:27,176
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and it's really the town boundary the city boundary as I understand you can't go outside city boundary for this funding however I

230
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:39,749
[SPEAKER_13]: There is, albeit old, but there is paving that starts in Winchester.

231
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:44,193
[SPEAKER_13]: You can tell where the line is.

232
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:55,725
[SPEAKER_13]: What we've also found is once we start initiating this project and we're looking at ... It would be great if we could connect up to Shannon Beach and say, Shannon Beach to High Street.

233
00:19:57,386 --> 00:20:00,548
[SPEAKER_13]: But bringing Winchester on board, like this is what we're doing right here.

234
00:20:00,848 --> 00:20:05,109
[SPEAKER_13]: And once we improve this path, now your path is gonna be old and outdated.

235
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:09,751
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're hoping that it'll kind of spark connections beyond that.

236
00:20:10,492 --> 00:20:12,072
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's really the line.

237
00:20:12,092 --> 00:20:13,293
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's right above the dam.

238
00:20:15,554 --> 00:20:16,334
[SPEAKER_13]: To High Street.

239
00:20:16,894 --> 00:20:17,114
[SPEAKER_13]: To 60, yeah.

240
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,671
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, there's some improvements that need to happen on that other part of the river coming up to that.

241
00:20:26,212 --> 00:20:28,152
[SPEAKER_13]: But then it's also in Arlington on the other side.

242
00:20:28,212 --> 00:20:34,234
[SPEAKER_13]: So dealing with the municipal boundaries can be difficult.

243
00:20:36,095 --> 00:20:36,195
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

244
00:20:36,555 --> 00:20:36,695
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

245
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:37,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

246
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:38,636
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

247
00:20:38,856 --> 00:20:40,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks.

248
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:45,378
[SPEAKER_13]: I also did bring a card and some maps if anybody wants one.

249
00:20:45,738 --> 00:20:45,958
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone?

250
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:50,794
[SPEAKER_13]: Here, you can take one and pass if you want.

251
00:20:51,435 --> 00:20:54,318
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's like the same map that was shown on the first screen.

252
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:55,219
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

253
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:58,303
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do have to head to another meeting in Arlington for CPAP.

254
00:20:59,043 --> 00:21:01,306
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm sorry to leave early.

255
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:01,886
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

256
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:02,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck.

257
00:21:02,187 --> 00:21:03,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

258
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:18,834
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so we'll invite the Medford Historical Commission to take the podium next.

259
00:21:44,848 --> 00:21:45,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, everybody.

260
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:47,069
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Jennifer Keenan.

261
00:21:47,649 --> 00:21:50,109
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the co-chair of the Medford Historical Commission.

262
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:56,491
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, our job at the commission is to, you know, help preserve and protect our history here in Medford.

263
00:21:57,471 --> 00:22:04,732
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, when we were thinking about an application for CPA, we tossed around a few ideas.

264
00:22:04,792 --> 00:22:11,574
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the projects that had been on our wish list for some time was the slave wall, which is on Grove Street.

265
00:22:12,554 --> 00:22:20,476
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, the project kind of evolved from just looking at the wall to looking at the entire park in and of itself.

266
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:28,378
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I think we can start with the wall kind of as the problem child, for some lack of a better way to describe it.

267
00:22:28,918 --> 00:22:30,638
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it's a beautiful site here.

268
00:22:31,499 --> 00:22:34,019
[SPEAKER_11]: The wall was part of Thomas Brooks' house.

269
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:35,760
[SPEAKER_11]: It was built by his slave.

270
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,203
[SPEAKER_11]: The clay for the bricks was used from the shore of the lake there.

271
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:54,788
[SPEAKER_11]: The worst thing about the wall is that you have to stand in the middle of Grove Street to admire the wall and actually read the marker.

272
00:22:55,628 --> 00:23:00,532
[SPEAKER_11]: And anybody who knows Grove Street, I live on Grove Street, so I walk by this every day.

273
00:23:00,552 --> 00:23:12,500
[SPEAKER_11]: And you're trying to stand there to read it, and there's an incline up there, so if you're trying to get close to the marker, if you have bad eyesight like me, you're kind of on this hilly terrain.

274
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:37,831
[SPEAKER_11]: there's no sidewalk there and there are cars whizzing by you behind you coming up Grove Street and so you know I just think as a resident of Grove Street as somebody who lives in the neighborhood that the wall just gets lost amongst you know it just looks like a big brushy piece of woods there and you know if you're on the sidewalk across the street you may or may not pay a lot of attention to it you might think it's part of the

275
00:23:38,331 --> 00:23:42,374
[SPEAKER_11]: commuter rail fence and whatnot.

276
00:23:42,494 --> 00:23:58,386
[SPEAKER_11]: So when I started to dig into the application and the project and I did some more research on the wall itself and really discovered that there's a six acre park here that was all of the land that Thomas Brooks owned himself.

277
00:23:59,007 --> 00:24:06,633
[SPEAKER_11]: And the park is part of, it's one of the 15 sites of the Brooks estate and all of their influences here in Medford.

278
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:15,875
[SPEAKER_11]: And so as the project evolved, it just made more sense to look at the park in its entirety and not just the wall itself and the marker.

279
00:24:15,995 --> 00:24:19,596
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be, I think we can agree that these are probably the most important parts of it.

280
00:24:20,816 --> 00:24:24,737
[SPEAKER_11]: But there is a larger, I don't know if you have a picture of the site.

281
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:28,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, yeah.

282
00:24:28,897 --> 00:24:29,918
[SPEAKER_11]: There is actually,

283
00:24:32,147 --> 00:24:33,949
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you can see it in your packet.

284
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:36,413
[SPEAKER_11]: Towards the end, I included some photos.

285
00:24:37,634 --> 00:24:47,867
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see there's a, you know, kind of a really nice wedge of green space here that, again, just gets lost amongst Grove Street as

286
00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:49,613
[SPEAKER_11]: Nothing.

287
00:24:50,274 --> 00:25:04,774
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's some makeshift foot trails in there, and there's this beautiful kind of open field that, you know, when you take a step back and kind of look at the whole site, it just made more sense to come up with a master plan to actually develop the entire site.

288
00:25:05,555 --> 00:25:07,796
[SPEAKER_11]: And what could this park be?

289
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:10,617
[SPEAKER_11]: It could have some beautiful seating arrangements.

290
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,298
[SPEAKER_11]: It could have a water element.

291
00:25:12,718 --> 00:25:18,700
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly an interpretive panel on Mr. Brooks and his family and his contributions to the city of Medford.

292
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:29,424
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of the main goals of the park itself would be to turn the marker around so that you're accessing it from the inside and not on the road.

293
00:25:30,184 --> 00:25:34,366
[SPEAKER_11]: Be able to get up close to the wall, really investigate it, move some of the brush away,

294
00:25:35,026 --> 00:25:36,867
[SPEAKER_11]: and just get in there and enjoy it.

295
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:45,751
[SPEAKER_11]: And so again, when we're looking at the whole park in and of itself, it just made more sense to come up with perhaps a parking area.

296
00:25:46,311 --> 00:26:00,678
[SPEAKER_11]: And so really the application evolved from there and now we're looking at it as an entire master plan for the park and having a design concept created for the park and how could this space be used.

297
00:26:03,537 --> 00:26:04,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

298
00:26:04,457 --> 00:26:05,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, I feel like I rambled.

299
00:26:06,018 --> 00:26:06,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Not at all.

300
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:07,439
[SPEAKER_14]: That's perfect.

301
00:26:08,479 --> 00:26:09,480
[SPEAKER_14]: Questions from the committee?

302
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,181
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a really stupid question.

303
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:14,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Which one is the wall, the brick or the stones?

304
00:26:14,202 --> 00:26:15,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, this side.

305
00:26:15,603 --> 00:26:17,784
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the actual slave wall itself.

306
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:25,968
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the marker on the left is a piece of granite with a bronze placard on it, which is the marker explaining what the wall is.

307
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:49,009
[SPEAKER_11]: It's funny they just put a speed bump on Grove Street kind of down a little bit so it you know now the cars don't come whizzing by quite as fast but literally the day I was there taking photos you know I'm like kind of standing on the wall

308
00:26:49,469 --> 00:27:02,993
[SPEAKER_11]: trying to take photos and there's cars coming behind me and you know it's just kind of one of those moments where you think to yourself who put this here and why did nobody think to turn it around so that you're not standing in the middle of the road to be able to read it.

309
00:27:04,594 --> 00:27:04,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

310
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:08,355
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you talk a little bit about how the property will be

311
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:15,581
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you talk a little bit about how the property could be accessed or would be accessed?

312
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:29,693
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah Sure, so there's actually kind of a makeshift area now that Because the they do go in and there's a kind of a big grassy area and the city I assume it's the city goes in and they mow the grass every once in a while.

313
00:27:30,014 --> 00:27:33,497
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a makeshift kind of like road that goes in there and

314
00:27:33,897 --> 00:27:47,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And so one of the things that I talked to the landscape architect about, I had a representative from Shadley and Associates out of Lexington, they had done some projects around Medford and other communities, kind of some of these larger park concepts.

315
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:52,375
[SPEAKER_11]: So I had Pam Shadley come out with me, we walked the site, and we do envision some sort of

316
00:27:52,895 --> 00:28:07,378
[SPEAKER_11]: maybe a little mini driveway and a couple of parking spots there so that if somebody wants to come from a different part of town to enjoy the park, especially any residents or any visitors to the main Shepherds Brooks Manor.

317
00:28:07,438 --> 00:28:19,421
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's important to try to tie the two sites together because our goal, I'm also on the Brooks Estate Committee, I am the liaison from the Historical Commission to the Brooks Estate Committee,

318
00:28:20,261 --> 00:28:27,743
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, our goal is to get more visitors up to the manor and to make that a functioning space and, you know, generating revenue for the city.

319
00:28:28,183 --> 00:28:45,807
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is such a short walk away, you know, it would be great to be able to let people realize that, you know, they're tied together and that they could, you know, not only go to the main manor, but go down the street just a little bit to, you know, another family members and read about them and learn about them as well.

320
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:54,917
[SPEAKER_11]: So, whether it's somebody coming from out of town who parks and, you know, visits the manor and they want to drive down and park at the Thomas Brooks Park.

321
00:28:54,977 --> 00:29:00,703
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we do envision, you know, perhaps a couple of parking spots there at some point and a little area to pull in.

322
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:08,905
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think the access would be, you know, it makes more sense to come in that way.

323
00:29:08,925 --> 00:29:13,929
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I don't know if it's ultimately going to be, you know, probably towards the lower end of the park.

324
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:21,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I think probably right by where the little speed bump is now or at the other end where there's almost a little makeshift driveway right now.

325
00:29:22,214 --> 00:29:23,595
[SPEAKER_11]: There isn't a curb cut there.

326
00:29:23,755 --> 00:29:27,337
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I think we'd have to work with the city to figure that that out.

327
00:29:27,497 --> 00:29:47,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, there'd be some sightline issues there because that's again that road it's very tough there it curves It's not straight and I think when you're coming over the bridge I don't know that necessarily having the the entryway right there would be feasible because Someone's gonna fly over the bridge and not realize someone stopped I suspect it's further south as you said, but that's again That's part of the study right is to figure out where could it go?

328
00:29:47,514 --> 00:29:48,195
[SPEAKER_17]: Where should it go?

329
00:29:48,215 --> 00:29:53,139
[SPEAKER_17]: It probably wants to align without the streets that you create an intersection obviously not offset right and we also

330
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,789
[SPEAKER_11]: The landscape architect and myself, we were talking about access from the neighborhoods across.

331
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,274
[SPEAKER_11]: There's beautiful residential neighborhood across.

332
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:09,743
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, a couple of crosswalks there, perhaps some lighting there at some point too could be amenable to get foot traffic there.

333
00:30:09,863 --> 00:30:14,405
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I think right now, again, like I mentioned, the space just gets lost.

334
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:19,208
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't even know that the residents who live almost across the street even realize what's there.

335
00:30:19,628 --> 00:30:30,335
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think if there's an obvious way to access it and, you know, some nice ways to pull in and say, oh, this is actually something we should pay attention to, would make a lot of sense.

336
00:30:32,487 --> 00:30:37,654
[SPEAKER_06]: Apologies for not knowing the answer to this, but is there an invasive species management portion of the project?

337
00:30:38,475 --> 00:30:39,316
[SPEAKER_11]: Not at this time.

338
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:44,122
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that we at this point realize kind of what's in there.

339
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:46,505
[SPEAKER_11]: I know we've just done some invasive

340
00:30:47,606 --> 00:30:55,913
[SPEAKER_11]: species management up at the manor itself, that we did some CPA for the Brooks Estates last round.

341
00:30:56,733 --> 00:31:01,917
[SPEAKER_11]: But we haven't quite figured out what's in here yet, so I think that's something that we could definitely look into.

342
00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:04,880
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to ride my bike through there, but there's so much poison ivy.

343
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,942
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if there's some naughty stuff in there.

344
00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:13,083
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of Norway maple and a lot of frozen ivy.

345
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:13,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

346
00:31:13,883 --> 00:31:28,329
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess at one point, and I'll be looking to my fellow commissioners and the folks at the Brooks Estate to research this a little bit more, there was a bank of elm trees that was quite beautiful and very visible from that park.

347
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:50,146
[SPEAKER_11]: which clearly have all been grown in, and so I think if there's a way to make those elms visible again, and you know, it could be quite beautiful if we could bring those back to life and make them purposeful there, that they were purposely planted and meant as kind of an access way and a, you know, eye point of contact for visitors.

348
00:31:52,935 --> 00:31:57,298
[SPEAKER_18]: Is part of the thought to restore the slave or just preserve what's there?

349
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:58,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I think just preserve what's there.

350
00:31:58,899 --> 00:32:05,583
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we would also make sure that if there is any deterioration, perhaps we need to look at that in the future.

351
00:32:06,563 --> 00:32:11,566
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now, you can't even get to it, so I think it would be hard to answer that fully.

352
00:32:11,626 --> 00:32:16,629
[SPEAKER_11]: But once we clear the brush all away, if there is any repointing that needs to happen or

353
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:26,375
[SPEAKER_11]: The wall, if you look at it from kind of, you know, the end and you're looking, it definitely kind of canters a little bit, but that could be purposeful.

354
00:32:26,415 --> 00:32:28,997
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not 100% sure that it wasn't always that way.

355
00:32:29,017 --> 00:32:34,540
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it wasn't, you know, they didn't have a level when it was built.

356
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,561
[SPEAKER_17]: I do worry about it tumbling into Grove Street.

357
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:42,783
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I fear when I drive by that thing every time because it's clearly No one's really taking care of it, right?

358
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:49,765
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I haven't seen anybody working that on that that wall in at least 20 years that I can remember

359
00:32:50,753 --> 00:33:00,218
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it can't be emphasized enough, because I know you mentioned at the beginning, but this and the Royal House are the two most prominent pieces talking about slavery in Medford.

360
00:33:00,238 --> 00:33:07,502
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is absolutely critical that people know what this is, understand it, along with the Royal House.

361
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:12,064
[SPEAKER_17]: The Royal House has reinvented itself, obviously, in the last 20 years to refocus their whole mission.

362
00:33:12,085 --> 00:33:18,008
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think a similar thing can start to happen here to make this site and the story behind it

363
00:33:18,668 --> 00:33:20,369
[SPEAKER_17]: which we really don't know a lot about.

364
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:21,590
[SPEAKER_17]: I know some of it.

365
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,070
[SPEAKER_17]: You've done some research as well.

366
00:33:23,871 --> 00:33:24,891
[SPEAKER_17]: But there's definitely more out there.

367
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:29,694
[SPEAKER_17]: The history of slavery in Medford is just not well documented.

368
00:33:29,994 --> 00:33:36,938
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is an opportunity to re-engage that whole issue on a beautiful piece of property that is wildly underutilized right now.

369
00:33:37,318 --> 00:33:37,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

370
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:45,825
[SPEAKER_11]: And you know, and it is, I would think my personal opinion is that it's, it's in really good shape, considering it hasn't been taken care of.

371
00:33:45,905 --> 00:33:49,188
[SPEAKER_11]: But I, you know, we want to maintain it, we don't want it to crumble into the street.

372
00:33:49,989 --> 00:33:59,256
[SPEAKER_11]: And I and again, I think just the opportunity to make the space all around a beautiful and a welcoming place would be, you know, a great use of CPA funds.

373
00:34:01,338 --> 00:34:03,440
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sorry, if I should know this, but the

374
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:05,985
[SPEAKER_10]: The city owns the property?

375
00:34:06,466 --> 00:34:06,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

376
00:34:07,426 --> 00:34:11,547
[SPEAKER_10]: And will be, the idea is that it would be maintained by the city?

377
00:34:11,607 --> 00:34:24,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think once it's a fully functioning park, I would imagine that it would fall under DPW purview and whatever their rounds of maintenance are and grass cutting and whatnot, it would fall under them.

378
00:34:25,211 --> 00:34:27,572
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there any other archeological resources on the site?

379
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:29,386
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, that's a good question.

380
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:49,396
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that that, when we, if we're able to clear it away and, you know, certainly if there's any digging that's gonna be happening, if we decide to do some other elements of the park and, you know, grading has to happen and digging that, you know, certainly if there's anything there that we can find and preserve, we would include that in the proposal.

381
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,092
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a question?

382
00:34:54,473 --> 00:34:57,141
[SPEAKER_01]: My question was about maintenance and who owns the property.

383
00:34:57,242 --> 00:34:57,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

384
00:34:57,623 --> 00:34:57,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

385
00:34:58,044 --> 00:34:59,448
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, the city owns it for sure.

386
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:08,106
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you see as the next step after this master plan is completed, then what happens?

387
00:35:09,947 --> 00:35:23,471
[SPEAKER_11]: So my envision is, my thought is that, you know, well, it'll be, this is almost a phased approach, so the first part is the actual, you know, some sort of master plan, and then, you know,

388
00:35:24,491 --> 00:35:37,435
[SPEAKER_11]: I think working with the Historical Commission and MBELT, does the rendering of whatever the landscape architect provided, does that work with our vision and what we want to do and how we see it?

389
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:40,036
[SPEAKER_11]: Does any tweaking need to take place?

390
00:35:40,076 --> 00:35:44,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Do we need to go broader, wider, bring in other vendors?

391
00:35:45,117 --> 00:35:49,880
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I think it would be a phased approach to actually implementation.

392
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,841
[SPEAKER_11]: And what does that look like?

393
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:55,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it focusing on the wall and the marker first?

394
00:35:55,383 --> 00:35:57,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it a larger green space?

395
00:35:57,164 --> 00:35:59,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it an access point for parking?

396
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:06,209
[SPEAKER_11]: I think depending on what it turns out to be or what some of the ideas are,

397
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:18,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we can start to look at at phases and certainly we would want to bring the community into it as well You know the the butters and the neighbors what do the folks in that could access it by foot?

398
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:19,399
[SPEAKER_11]: What would they want to see?

399
00:36:19,439 --> 00:36:20,800
[SPEAKER_11]: How would they like to use the space?

400
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they looking for green space to go sit and read a book?

401
00:36:24,122 --> 00:36:26,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Are they looking for a place for their kids to play?

402
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:32,449
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it could be a myriad of things, you know, we have a really beautiful jungle gym over at play said Park, which is not a

403
00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:34,892
[SPEAKER_11]: that far behind, you know, down Bustle.

404
00:36:34,932 --> 00:36:38,177
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little bit of an easy walk from all of us over there.

405
00:36:38,257 --> 00:36:41,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So maybe the park, maybe the Brooks Park is something different, you know.

406
00:36:41,862 --> 00:36:46,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe it's just a nice quiet place to sit, have a picnic, read a little bit, learn some history.

407
00:36:46,808 --> 00:36:49,893
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we need to figure some of those things out.

408
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:55,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, that was gonna be my next question was what do you envision for public input in the process?

409
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:06,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we would definitely want the neighbors involved for sure And then I and anybody really, you know, this is a green space in Medford It could be my hope is that it's accessed by the whole town.

410
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:10,672
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, there's part there's parking there And people would come and enjoy it.

411
00:37:10,732 --> 00:37:12,693
[SPEAKER_11]: So what do you know?

412
00:37:12,873 --> 00:37:16,877
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of beautiful parks in Medford and I think thinking of

413
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:23,615
[SPEAKER_11]: what needs are being addressed in certain parks and what are the holes and can we fill in some of those holes here.

414
00:37:24,997 --> 00:37:43,990
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's probably comparable to the road design at the Brooks Estate in terms of its process that we looked at in phase one, I'm sorry, round one of the CPA because there's clearly dozens of stakeholders who would need to be involved, engineering, even historical society, the abutters, OCD, engineering.

415
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:49,634
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, there's so many people who need to be part of this discussion about what that park becomes.

416
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,656
[SPEAKER_17]: It's quite a shopping list of people from what I gather.

417
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:56,178
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we're just starting to think that through right now on the road.

418
00:37:56,238 --> 00:37:56,959
[SPEAKER_11]: On the road, right.

419
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:58,399
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's comparable.

420
00:37:58,539 --> 00:37:59,860
[SPEAKER_17]: It's almost the same size.

421
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,560
[SPEAKER_17]: The driveway.

422
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,341
[SPEAKER_17]: That's right.

423
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,262
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for correcting.

424
00:38:04,642 --> 00:38:05,302
[SPEAKER_11]: The driveway.

425
00:38:05,322 --> 00:38:16,067
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I think, you know, there could be some elements there that once, for example, once the driveway is designed and we know what's going to be happening up at the manor,

426
00:38:16,687 --> 00:38:20,970
[SPEAKER_11]: then perhaps some ideas for the park fall out of that.

427
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:27,535
[SPEAKER_11]: If X, Y, and Z is happening over here, a mile down the road can be X, Y, and Z over here.

428
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:41,806
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that the timing of this while we're kind of thinking of both sites and actively pursuing money and projects for both sites, the timing is good where we can all work together to make them work together.

429
00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:42,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

430
00:38:46,463 --> 00:38:49,206
[SPEAKER_01]: How involved is the Community Development Office with this?

431
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:56,755
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, besides the obvious preservation of the wall, it seems a little bit beyond the scope of the Historical Commission on its own.

432
00:38:57,774 --> 00:39:01,697
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I mean, to my knowledge, they haven't been involved in this at all.

433
00:39:01,877 --> 00:39:06,281
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, when creating the proposal, I did not reach out to them.

434
00:39:07,202 --> 00:39:13,187
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, our thought at the Historical Commission is that, you know, this is something that we wanted to implement and start.

435
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:18,291
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, you know, us and EMBELT working together, I think, is a really good place to start.

436
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:22,775
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, as Doug mentioned, we'll pull in other folks as needed.

437
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:25,755
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we have seven members on the Historical Commission.

438
00:39:25,775 --> 00:39:33,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we're a really great body, and we all come from all walks of life and professional backgrounds.

439
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:47,079
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think, you know, when we were discussing this and kind of reviewing our final application, we all thought that this is something that, as a group, we could manage together and at least, you know, get the ball rolling as far down the road as possible.

440
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:51,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, we can just do it on our end.

441
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:52,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

442
00:39:56,212 --> 00:39:56,552
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

443
00:39:56,873 --> 00:39:57,253
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

444
00:39:57,273 --> 00:39:57,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you guys.

445
00:39:58,054 --> 00:39:58,594
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

446
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:06,101
[SPEAKER_14]: The next project is Oak Grove Cemetery historic landscape rehabilitation.

447
00:40:08,543 --> 00:40:08,843
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi there.

448
00:40:09,564 --> 00:40:10,985
[SPEAKER_12]: Introduce yourself please.

449
00:40:11,105 --> 00:40:12,066
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm Abigail Salerno.

450
00:40:12,086 --> 00:40:13,667
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm also from the Historical Commission.

451
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:22,655
[SPEAKER_12]: And this application comes from the Historical Commission working with the cemetery trustees and the Medford tree warden.

452
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,102
[SPEAKER_12]: Were you able to include pictures from this afternoon?

453
00:40:27,182 --> 00:40:27,302
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

454
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I have some recent pictures.

455
00:40:31,272 --> 00:40:33,113
[SPEAKER_12]: Three sets of trees.

456
00:40:35,994 --> 00:40:38,635
[SPEAKER_12]: A stump, a tree that's already been removed.

457
00:40:39,595 --> 00:40:46,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Some trees that are clearly sort of truncated and dead in front of a mausoleum.

458
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:50,619
[SPEAKER_12]: They are obviously marked to be removed and partially removed.

459
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,980
[SPEAKER_12]: Their limbs are missing.

460
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,021
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the third photo is

461
00:40:56,242 --> 00:41:01,606
[SPEAKER_12]: trees marked to be removed that still have their limbs but are clearly unhealthy and dying.

462
00:41:05,649 --> 00:41:11,613
[SPEAKER_12]: The trees in the photos and the trees in the application are all located over here in the

463
00:41:13,466 --> 00:41:16,848
[SPEAKER_12]: in the rock garden portion of the cemetery.

464
00:41:16,908 --> 00:41:21,091
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the original land that was set aside.

465
00:41:21,131 --> 00:41:37,041
[SPEAKER_12]: It was designed by a landscape architect in the Victorian period to be a public park, to be a place where people walked, where people enjoyed outdoor space in a very sort of manicured, a relatively manicured

466
00:41:37,721 --> 00:41:38,502
[SPEAKER_12]: type landscape.

467
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:51,129
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not the fells, it's not a ball field, it's not a playground, it's a quiet and somewhat formal space.

468
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:58,554
[SPEAKER_12]: And right now there are 20 trees in there that are sort of in various states as shown in the photographs.

469
00:41:59,254 --> 00:42:07,337
[SPEAKER_12]: either they've recently been removed, they're slated for removal, or they're obviously unhealthy.

470
00:42:07,737 --> 00:42:23,122
[SPEAKER_12]: So the application is applying for money to replace those trees and also to install in the cemetery an informational kiosk that can focus and capitalize on what the Historical Commission thinks is sort of significant community interest in using this space.

471
00:42:24,202 --> 00:42:35,349
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, local historians, genealogists visit the cemetery, people visiting, graves of family members visit the cemetery, but the cemetery also hosts joggers, people with strollers.

472
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:40,872
[SPEAKER_12]: It is plowed all winter, so people enjoy using it in the winter.

473
00:42:41,712 --> 00:42:44,434
[SPEAKER_12]: people learn to drive in the Elk Grove Cemetery.

474
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:48,476
[SPEAKER_12]: Or at least they remember fondly having learned to drive or having learned to ride their bicycles.

475
00:42:48,496 --> 00:42:52,978
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a really strong sentimental attachment to the cemetery as a whole.

476
00:42:54,859 --> 00:42:55,939
[SPEAKER_12]: People learn to ride their bikes.

477
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:00,782
[SPEAKER_12]: Seniors take prom pictures there because it's one of Medford's only formal gardens.

478
00:43:01,842 --> 00:43:02,422
[SPEAKER_12]: in some ways.

479
00:43:02,542 --> 00:43:14,906
[SPEAKER_12]: It has flowering plants and then it has trees that are intentionally placed in a designed landscape that creates beautiful views and vistas as you walk the paths in the rock garden section.

480
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:23,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Boulders, sort of these picturesque points of interest that were designed by the original planners.

481
00:43:24,389 --> 00:43:26,450
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a space a lot like

482
00:43:28,696 --> 00:43:29,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Mount Auburn or Forest Hills.

483
00:43:30,038 --> 00:43:31,780
[SPEAKER_12]: It has that feel.

484
00:43:32,201 --> 00:43:37,869
[SPEAKER_12]: And it could have some of the same uses and some of the same popularity that those places have.

485
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:40,953
[SPEAKER_12]: So the informational kiosk is pulled together.

486
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,375
[SPEAKER_12]: It would have a guest book.

487
00:43:42,435 --> 00:43:44,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully it would set out some of the

488
00:43:45,058 --> 00:43:52,985
[SPEAKER_12]: guidelines for using the space, make people feel welcome, let them know that by being there and using the space, they were following the rules.

489
00:43:53,106 --> 00:43:56,589
[SPEAKER_12]: People often feel like they're trespassing if they go in the cemetery.

490
00:43:56,609 --> 00:44:00,973
[SPEAKER_12]: We want to dispel that while at the same time telling them, yeah, don't leave a mess.

491
00:44:02,774 --> 00:44:03,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Stuff like that.

492
00:44:03,475 --> 00:44:04,696
[SPEAKER_12]: So two parts.

493
00:44:06,873 --> 00:44:12,279
[SPEAKER_12]: replacing about 20 trees, and then erecting an informational kiosk.

494
00:44:16,544 --> 00:44:16,705
Yeah.

495
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:19,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

496
00:44:19,928 --> 00:44:21,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Any questions from the committee?

497
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:26,196
[SPEAKER_09]: So is it all in that area on the Winchester line down here?

498
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:33,239
[SPEAKER_12]: There are 20 trees in that area that are in the process of being removed.

499
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:43,783
[SPEAKER_12]: There are same type of trees throughout the rest of the cemetery that are in trouble, but there are much far fewer trees in the rest of the cemetery.

500
00:44:43,863 --> 00:44:49,905
[SPEAKER_12]: It's sunnier, it's more open, so there might be like five or six in the cemetery as a whole.

501
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,210
[SPEAKER_12]: on the larger part of the cemetery.

502
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:56,432
[SPEAKER_12]: It's sort of disproportionately over here that the trees exist.

503
00:44:56,592 --> 00:44:56,692
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

504
00:44:56,712 --> 00:44:57,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that fountain work?

505
00:44:58,332 --> 00:44:58,532
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

506
00:44:58,652 --> 00:44:59,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Does the fountain work?

507
00:45:00,353 --> 00:45:01,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Does the fountain work?

508
00:45:01,553 --> 00:45:04,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I see a fountain, or maybe it's just Fountain Road around us.

509
00:45:05,114 --> 00:45:05,994
[SPEAKER_12]: There is a fountain.

510
00:45:06,014 --> 00:45:09,855
[SPEAKER_12]: There's beautiful sculptures in the cemetery.

511
00:45:10,195 --> 00:45:10,975
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a fountain.

512
00:45:11,235 --> 00:45:15,236
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a beautiful set of stone steps that lead down to Winthrop Street.

513
00:45:15,256 --> 00:45:16,357
[SPEAKER_12]: These are huge projects.

514
00:45:17,437 --> 00:45:29,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Cemetery, if it developed friends of the cemetery group, or if it continued to engage the public, should and could work on, that is not where we are starting.

515
00:45:31,014 --> 00:45:34,138
[SPEAKER_12]: We are starting with replacing some stumps.

516
00:45:36,814 --> 00:45:38,655
[SPEAKER_12]: It's such a beautiful place.

517
00:45:38,855 --> 00:45:40,376
[SPEAKER_12]: I've never been to that area.

518
00:45:42,938 --> 00:45:46,260
[SPEAKER_12]: And it does, at this point, take knowing about it and intentionally going to it.

519
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:58,287
[SPEAKER_12]: You can drive into the cemetery and immediately head to the more contemporary area on the left without noticing that we have this historic landscape over in the corner.

520
00:45:59,247 --> 00:46:06,630
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, as Jen was saying, it really is a kind of space that we don't have a lot of in Medford.

521
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:20,915
[SPEAKER_12]: We have beautiful parks and playgrounds, and we have the fells, but this is historic and it's formal in a way that isn't something you'd find in other parts of Medford's sort of greenscape map.

522
00:46:23,827 --> 00:46:29,850
[SPEAKER_10]: And who does the maintenance now and who will do this project?

523
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:36,192
[SPEAKER_12]: DPW is happy to replant the trees that we can fund.

524
00:46:36,772 --> 00:46:41,074
[SPEAKER_12]: They currently do the raking and the maintenance of what's there.

525
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:48,676
[SPEAKER_12]: They were the ones that gave us the price for replacing the trees.

526
00:46:49,976 --> 00:47:01,838
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think that they could be helped and supported by, again, an ongoing friends group, especially if we wanted them to do more in terms of maintaining the historic quality.

527
00:47:01,979 --> 00:47:03,399
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's no friends group right now?

528
00:47:03,499 --> 00:47:03,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope.

529
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:07,200
[SPEAKER_12]: And in fact, I think they

530
00:47:10,933 --> 00:47:13,015
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a trustees group of three.

531
00:47:13,215 --> 00:47:14,756
[SPEAKER_12]: They would like to have more trustees.

532
00:47:15,197 --> 00:47:17,479
[SPEAKER_12]: They lost a trustee.

533
00:47:17,499 --> 00:47:18,280
[SPEAKER_12]: They gained a trustee.

534
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:19,521
[SPEAKER_12]: There's still a trustee short.

535
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:27,148
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that there's a lot of work to be done in getting people to understand that the cemetery is something that if we value, we can contribute.

536
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:32,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Other questions?

537
00:47:35,361 --> 00:47:36,441
[SPEAKER_14]: I had a couple of questions.

538
00:47:36,542 --> 00:47:38,483
[SPEAKER_14]: One of them was the kiosks.

539
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:54,435
[SPEAKER_14]: The kiosks, I understand, are kind of a capital investment in building the structures themselves, but they will be populated with materials that are more transient in nature.

540
00:47:54,855 --> 00:48:08,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Can the cost of the materials be another source of funding be used for those transient materials so that the CPA funds are focused on the capital improvements?

541
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you understand what I'm asking?

542
00:48:10,527 --> 00:48:11,368
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I do understand what you're asking.

543
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:17,152
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be a kind of maintenance of the kiosk, just in terms of keeping it up to date and stocked.

544
00:48:17,172 --> 00:48:21,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Who can take charge of ensuring that the materials are kept up to date?

545
00:48:23,197 --> 00:48:40,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, the Historical Commission is making this application and is willing to consider either investing that kind of work and funds to it or, again, finding a group of friends to raise that money and keep it viable.

546
00:48:46,354 --> 00:49:03,504
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was also, in reading the application, I'm trying to make sure that I understand the relationship between the Historical Commission, the tree warden, the DPW, of who's managing the project and who's, you know, actually carrying it out.

547
00:49:04,685 --> 00:49:06,626
[SPEAKER_12]: The Historical Commission would be managing the project.

548
00:49:06,666 --> 00:49:07,266
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be me.

549
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:15,030
[SPEAKER_12]: So far, Dee Morris, the cemetery trustee, has been the person who's given me sort of the most guidance in terms of

550
00:49:17,702 --> 00:49:27,407
[SPEAKER_12]: what she thinks is needed in the cemetery and who she thinks we can work with to get the work done.

551
00:49:29,908 --> 00:49:41,794
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would probably be me and her and Aggie Toon, the tree warden, researching what kind of trees should replace these trees because there's, I think, a case to be made for the same trees.

552
00:49:41,834 --> 00:49:43,175
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what was historically there.

553
00:49:43,615 --> 00:49:44,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Or maybe something that isn't.

554
00:49:46,397 --> 00:50:02,736
[SPEAKER_12]: quite as susceptible to disease because the trees are really unhealthy so making those decisions it would be the three of us and working with the cemetery superintendent who is a DPW employee once we've made those decisions to have them carry out the replanting which

555
00:50:04,631 --> 00:50:05,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, what are the trees now?

556
00:50:05,913 --> 00:50:07,354
[SPEAKER_17]: What type of trees are they right now?

557
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:08,055
[SPEAKER_17]: The ones that didn't?

558
00:50:08,075 --> 00:50:11,519
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

559
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,805
[SPEAKER_12]: The tree warden needs to take a trip out and help me make a definitive decision.

560
00:50:16,885 --> 00:50:20,129
[SPEAKER_12]: It's an oak tree, but I don't know like, sure, what kind.

561
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,875
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't know whether it's something we would want to use as a replacement or not.

562
00:50:25,315 --> 00:50:28,537
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, I guess part of that is why did they fail?

563
00:50:28,697 --> 00:50:30,398
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess, you know, it's the obvious counter question.

564
00:50:30,558 --> 00:50:36,602
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I think that working on that is something that me and the trustee and the tree warden will be.

565
00:50:38,007 --> 00:50:46,529
[SPEAKER_17]: I think your comparison to Mount Auburn is interesting because obviously they're of the same vintage when that oldest part of the cemetery was designed and built.

566
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:58,232
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously Mount Auburn has a lot more marquee famous people buried there, but if you go there on a fall weekend there are hundreds if not more people.

567
00:50:58,352 --> 00:50:59,852
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like a destination.

568
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:11,363
[SPEAKER_17]: It's because there's maps and there's information and I know Dee has done tours of the cemetery and they've been really well received.

569
00:51:11,843 --> 00:51:17,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to show some of the hidden gems that she knows about, I'm sure there's more to be uncovered.

570
00:51:17,729 --> 00:51:33,296
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, obviously, the sort of civic ancestors that she's invested in and that people are interested in are one of the reasons people go, but I mean, you have, I would say, maybe 70% of the people who go aren't there to find a specific historic gravesite.

571
00:51:33,316 --> 00:51:34,777
[SPEAKER_12]: They're there because it's a beautiful place.

572
00:51:35,837 --> 00:52:03,862
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was sort of hoping that was sort of the second thing that I wanted the photographs to show, not just sort of state of the trees, but also each of those photographs should sort of give you a sense of how intentional the landscape is, that the missing trees contribute to a very sort of specific view that you get when you're standing like at a particular crossroad of paths or when you're standing looking at a hillside and you can sort of see these arches

573
00:52:04,422 --> 00:52:05,663
[SPEAKER_12]: running through the photographs.

574
00:52:06,944 --> 00:52:16,391
[SPEAKER_12]: You can see in this one, right, this missing tree is part of a line of trees that lines this particular drive.

575
00:52:17,292 --> 00:52:26,398
[SPEAKER_12]: And then here, the drive arches this way, and then there should be an arch of trees going this way, but they're missing their leaves.

576
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,142
[SPEAKER_12]: And then on this one, again, there's sort of an arch

577
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:35,806
[SPEAKER_12]: of the path going this way, and I'm not sure which is going this way.

578
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:49,269
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, the chair of the historical commission is convinced that the same landscape architect designed Mount Auburn, Forest Hills, and the rock garden part of the cemetery.

579
00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:56,611
[SPEAKER_12]: The historical research that I included in the application doesn't quite make that claim.

580
00:52:57,451 --> 00:52:58,531
[SPEAKER_12]: They're of the same vintage.

581
00:52:58,911 --> 00:53:00,332
[SPEAKER_12]: They're from the same school of thought.

582
00:53:02,332 --> 00:53:11,380
[SPEAKER_12]: They're part of a related movement, but the research from the Historical Society doesn't quite make the claim that it's the same exact individual who designed them.

583
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:19,546
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, I mean, you look at those photos and they could have come from any really beautiful Victorian garden cemetery of the period.

584
00:53:23,027 --> 00:53:23,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

585
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:24,388
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

586
00:53:24,828 --> 00:53:25,869
[SPEAKER_14]: Great presentations.

587
00:53:27,991 --> 00:53:37,438
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we'll invite you to present on the Hickey Park improvement.

588
00:53:38,259 --> 00:53:39,320
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

589
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:44,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to present the small grant application for the Hickey Park canopy project.

590
00:53:46,941 --> 00:53:53,488
[SPEAKER_00]: I submitted this application through our PTO in cooperation with Brian Kearns, the head of the Medford DPW.

591
00:53:54,229 --> 00:53:58,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a resident about four houses away from this park for more than a decade.

592
00:53:59,014 --> 00:54:01,838
[SPEAKER_00]: I walk there every day with my dog.

593
00:54:01,898 --> 00:54:05,141
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring my daughter there to play and I look at this canopy and I say this is a

594
00:54:06,062 --> 00:54:07,923
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an opportunity to be something.

595
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:11,824
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a promise that wasn't quite fulfilled.

596
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:19,846
[SPEAKER_00]: And pretty much as soon as I moved in there, I started trying to find out a way to make this something.

597
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:26,207
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is there a canopy over a holy hard mound of dirt and nothing else?

598
00:54:27,308 --> 00:54:27,728
[SPEAKER_00]: And so

599
00:54:29,602 --> 00:54:32,445
[SPEAKER_00]: I found that this canopy was actually donated to the city.

600
00:54:33,205 --> 00:54:37,069
[SPEAKER_00]: This structure is solid and will last us for decades to come.

601
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:51,283
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we really need to make this a community gathering space, this park is so well loved and used, we could put the canopy right on top of there, put a couple of picnic tables underneath, and we have a community gathering space.

602
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:54,106
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so many people using this park.

603
00:54:54,146 --> 00:54:56,829
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Roberts Elementary uses this.

604
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:59,252
[SPEAKER_00]: The PTO uses it for kindergarten playdates.

605
00:54:59,792 --> 00:55:01,194
[SPEAKER_00]: The MFN is down there.

606
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:06,540
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at least two daycares that I see walking with the little tow lines down to this park almost daily.

607
00:55:08,002 --> 00:55:18,808
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a pickleball league of seniors this summer that was there that had brought their own folding chairs to sit under the canopy, and they could have sat at a couple of picnic tables and chatted and had a light lunch.

608
00:55:19,928 --> 00:55:27,172
[SPEAKER_00]: The baseball field, the softball field, the tennis court, almost every day there's people there, the basketball courts.

609
00:55:27,192 --> 00:55:35,137
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a well-loved park, and what it's lacking is a place to gather in the shade and just be in your community.

610
00:55:37,698 --> 00:55:44,127
[SPEAKER_00]: a small change that would make such a huge difference in this park and it would be amazing for us.

611
00:55:44,827 --> 00:55:53,338
[SPEAKER_00]: I did check in with the city, Lauren DiLorenzo and community development, the mayor's office and Brian Kearns and the DPW.

612
00:55:53,499 --> 00:55:54,880
[SPEAKER_00]: There are no current projects to

613
00:55:56,642 --> 00:55:59,204
[SPEAKER_00]: on line to change this park.

614
00:56:00,184 --> 00:56:14,074
[SPEAKER_00]: But Brian stressed that if there were suddenly to be some grand plan that he would, this is such a strong canopy structure, that this is something they would uninstall and reinstall either here or somewhere else because this

615
00:56:14,634 --> 00:56:16,316
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just an amazing structure.

616
00:56:16,436 --> 00:56:17,418
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very large.

617
00:56:18,439 --> 00:56:24,746
[SPEAKER_00]: If we put two picnic tables under here, there would still be room for someone to lay out a blanket or for kids to run around.

618
00:56:24,766 --> 00:56:31,034
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just such a huge area that I would love to see more people enjoy.

619
00:56:35,003 --> 00:56:39,546
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a small project, so I don't really know any other questions that you have.

620
00:56:39,586 --> 00:56:41,627
[SPEAKER_00]: The DPW would be installing this.

621
00:56:42,548 --> 00:56:47,451
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be purchasing the materials just through a catalog that we purchased.

622
00:56:47,471 --> 00:56:48,451
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be installed.

623
00:56:48,511 --> 00:56:50,853
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be loved and used by the community.

624
00:56:52,385 --> 00:56:52,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

625
00:56:53,005 --> 00:57:00,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Would they be, so would they be like regrading or putting any new soil in or doing anything to the surface?

626
00:57:01,408 --> 00:57:06,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, the DPW would be making that a better area.

627
00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:10,031
[SPEAKER_10]: And what would be under there, still grass or?

628
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:13,252
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they have to cement in the

629
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:18,125
[SPEAKER_00]: The tables, but there's not a plan to cement the whole area.

630
00:57:18,565 --> 00:57:22,469
[SPEAKER_00]: But they do realize that they'll have to break that up.

631
00:57:22,549 --> 00:57:28,836
[SPEAKER_10]: And would they have to uninstall it and reinstall it, or can they do the work around?

632
00:57:30,517 --> 00:57:33,160
[SPEAKER_00]: There was no indications that they would uninstall it to do this work.

633
00:57:36,158 --> 00:57:37,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Does the canopy need to be replaced?

634
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:40,299
[SPEAKER_00]: The canopy's got some significant holes.

635
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:46,762
[SPEAKER_00]: The amazing thing about it is if it's had some holes for 10 years and it's still retained this much.

636
00:57:46,822 --> 00:57:50,883
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a canvas that pretty much the warranty is about 10 years.

637
00:57:53,004 --> 00:57:58,785
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's kept well, the DPW thinks it'll last much longer.

638
00:57:58,905 --> 00:57:59,366
[SPEAKER_00]: This one...

639
00:58:00,626 --> 00:58:02,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Had holes in it a decade ago.

640
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:05,095
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's probably 15 or more years old.

641
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:10,766
[SPEAKER_00]: So it holds up pretty well It's a durable, you know heavy canvas

642
00:58:15,844 --> 00:58:16,845
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a question.

643
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:32,719
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that I'm not really entirely sure myself how the process works here in Medford, but in selecting the picnic table or whatever the furniture is that you put under the canopy,

644
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:49,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Will the Commission on Disabilities be consulted or is there a process to ensure that handicap accessibility is taken into consideration in the selection of the furniture?

645
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,681
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't answer that question.

646
00:58:53,901 --> 00:58:59,205
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that this park underwent some updates to make it more ADA compliant.

647
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:04,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, behind that area is where the handicap crosswalk is.

648
00:59:04,649 --> 00:59:12,875
[SPEAKER_00]: They redid some of the pathways, extended them because you couldn't get from Park Street right into the park.

649
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:14,717
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't cross from Brogan

650
00:59:16,146 --> 00:59:17,767
[SPEAKER_00]: to get to the other side for the park.

651
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:21,709
[SPEAKER_00]: It was harder to access the baseball field.

652
00:59:21,749 --> 00:59:23,910
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did do some changes there already.

653
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:27,252
[SPEAKER_00]: There is right in front of this is pavement.

654
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:34,176
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine if they had if they needed to put a short jaunt, that could be something that they would achieve.

655
00:59:35,036 --> 00:59:38,078
[SPEAKER_00]: They hadn't really thought that far just

656
00:59:38,722 --> 00:59:41,105
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we put here to make this usable space?

657
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:44,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I wouldn't want to sit under there now.

658
00:59:44,688 --> 00:59:48,592
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen people put folding tables there and try to jockey them because it's not flat.

659
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:51,375
[SPEAKER_00]: But right now, it's pretty much unusable.

660
00:59:54,418 --> 00:59:54,799
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

661
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:56,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

662
00:59:56,441 --> 00:59:57,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Renee.

663
00:59:57,562 --> 00:59:57,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

664
01:00:03,964 --> 01:00:07,827
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, that concludes our presentations for this evening.

665
01:00:08,547 --> 01:00:17,353
[SPEAKER_14]: We had one more presentation originally scheduled, but that's been rescheduled for next week, October 2nd.

666
01:00:17,453 --> 01:00:23,997
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have the second evening of candidate presentations.

667
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:37,372
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a couple of other items left on our agenda this evening, mainly to talk about the wrap-up and the next steps for the committee.

668
01:00:37,852 --> 01:00:40,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there any comment before we move on?

669
01:00:43,396 --> 01:00:43,596
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

670
01:00:44,577 --> 01:00:46,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

671
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:47,898
[SPEAKER_14]: You can be excused if you want.

672
01:00:47,918 --> 01:00:48,478
[SPEAKER_14]: You can stay.

673
01:00:48,498 --> 01:00:49,859
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome to stay if you wish.

674
01:00:54,461 --> 01:00:55,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go celebrate your birthday.

675
01:00:59,944 --> 01:01:00,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

676
01:01:03,805 --> 01:01:08,147
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll give a moment to clear, and then I'll resume.

677
01:01:08,448 --> 01:01:08,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Good night.

678
01:01:09,348 --> 01:01:09,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

679
01:01:09,988 --> 01:01:10,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you all.

680
01:01:14,782 --> 01:01:23,189
[SPEAKER_14]: So I wanted to actually just talk about the next steps for now, because we have a little bit of time this evening.

681
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:27,252
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a shorter set of presentations.

682
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:34,478
[SPEAKER_14]: So this evening, we could take advantage of that to make sure that we have scheduled the meetings.

683
01:01:34,598 --> 01:01:38,041
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it would be a good idea to schedule meetings through the rest of the year.

684
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,804
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to pull out my calendar for a moment.

685
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:49,229
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have listed what I think are the meetings that we need for the rest of the year.

686
01:01:49,749 --> 01:01:52,631
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not as easy as one meeting per month, unfortunately.

687
01:01:53,632 --> 01:02:00,316
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to have two meetings for deliberation after the presentations are completed.

688
01:02:01,657 --> 01:02:15,863
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I see at least two meetings after that, one of which will be a preliminary discussion about the application process and priorities and criteria review.

689
01:02:17,803 --> 01:02:24,446
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the other meeting is a hearing, public hearing to collect public input on those things.

690
01:02:27,427 --> 01:02:29,648
[SPEAKER_14]: Then we'll also, I think,

691
01:02:32,921 --> 01:02:49,432
[SPEAKER_14]: need a second meeting to finalize to accept our final revision of the priorities and criteria and application process, but that can go into January if we need to.

692
01:02:50,262 --> 01:02:58,086
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd like to schedule the four meetings, minimum of four meetings, or possibly five through the end of the year.

693
01:02:58,547 --> 01:03:05,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we want to meet twice in October, or do we want to have a meeting in October?

694
01:03:05,070 --> 01:03:06,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we want to continue with Tuesday evenings?

695
01:03:08,932 --> 01:03:14,177
[SPEAKER_14]: I put some meetings on my calendar, but I don't know whether we had actually talked about those meetings.

696
01:03:14,297 --> 01:03:24,687
[SPEAKER_14]: I have on my calendar October 9th and October 23rd, but I can't find in our minutes that we've talked about that together, so I might have made that up.

697
01:03:24,907 --> 01:03:25,507
[SPEAKER_14]: I have the 9th.

698
01:03:25,848 --> 01:03:26,388
[SPEAKER_14]: You have the 9th?

699
01:03:26,408 --> 01:03:28,530
[SPEAKER_15]: I have the 23rd as a placeholder to be confirmed tonight.

700
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:29,251
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

701
01:03:30,192 --> 01:03:31,833
[SPEAKER_09]: I can do the 9th, but not the 23rd.

702
01:03:32,414 --> 01:03:32,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

703
01:03:33,214 --> 01:03:33,735
[SPEAKER_06]: I can do both.

704
01:03:35,197 --> 01:03:35,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Andre?

705
01:03:36,097 --> 01:03:37,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I can't do that.

706
01:03:37,198 --> 01:03:38,638
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just double check.

707
01:03:39,318 --> 01:03:40,999
[SPEAKER_06]: And are we meeting on the 2nd also?

708
01:03:41,399 --> 01:03:42,279
[SPEAKER_06]: The 2nd, yes.

709
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,340
[SPEAKER_06]: So that'll be three meetings in October.

710
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:45,480
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be.

711
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:46,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it is a five.

712
01:03:47,381 --> 01:03:50,742
[SPEAKER_14]: There are five Tuesdays in October.

713
01:03:50,762 --> 01:03:52,042
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's three and five.

714
01:03:52,442 --> 01:03:54,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Mom really wants to see us in October.

715
01:03:56,064 --> 01:04:02,050
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm flexible.

716
01:04:04,492 --> 01:04:06,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Because if we go to the 30th, we're still in October.

717
01:04:09,316 --> 01:04:10,157
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we confirm the 9th?

718
01:04:10,197 --> 01:04:10,637
[SPEAKER_09]: The 9th?

719
01:04:11,578 --> 01:04:12,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the 9th.

720
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:14,721
[SPEAKER_04]: So the second is obviously the presentations.

721
01:04:14,801 --> 01:04:17,824
[SPEAKER_04]: The 9th we're going to discuss all the presentations.

722
01:04:18,195 --> 01:04:25,600
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we're going to discuss them and take a preliminary vote on whether to recommend them.

723
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:34,426
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the second meeting is going to be to finalize the language and the recommendations before we send it to City Council.

724
01:04:35,627 --> 01:04:36,868
[SPEAKER_10]: I might not be able to do the 23rd.

725
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:41,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so ninth, we can confirm a yes.

726
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,413
[SPEAKER_14]: But the 23rd looks like it doesn't work for a few people.

727
01:04:45,453 --> 01:04:46,713
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're missing a few people.

728
01:04:46,813 --> 01:04:49,734
[SPEAKER_14]: So we don't know whether they would be able to make that or not.

729
01:04:51,235 --> 01:04:51,835
[SPEAKER_14]: How about the 30th?

730
01:04:51,915 --> 01:04:52,215
[SPEAKER_14]: 30th?

731
01:04:52,575 --> 01:04:56,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, good here.

732
01:04:56,116 --> 01:05:00,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so let's cross out the 23rd and put the 30th for the second meeting.

733
01:05:07,318 --> 01:05:10,620
[SPEAKER_09]: and that's for crafting recommendations to the city council?

734
01:05:10,881 --> 01:05:11,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

735
01:05:16,044 --> 01:05:20,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to be clear, we have October 2nd, 9th, and 30th, is that right?

736
01:05:20,448 --> 01:05:20,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

737
01:05:21,268 --> 01:05:22,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Because there's five.

738
01:05:22,589 --> 01:05:25,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I know.

739
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:29,114
[SPEAKER_15]: And the 9th and 30th will be at the DPW, not here.

740
01:05:29,374 --> 01:05:29,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

741
01:05:31,736 --> 01:05:33,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Assuming we get that room right.

742
01:05:36,174 --> 01:05:38,376
[SPEAKER_05]: We evicted him one time.

743
01:05:38,396 --> 01:05:42,098
[SPEAKER_05]: We were the first ones to have the idea.

744
01:05:42,138 --> 01:05:44,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle, you have the inside track.

745
01:05:52,806 --> 01:06:18,206
[SPEAKER_14]: City Hall do Then the following meeting or meetings can be in November December we could do one meeting in November and one in December if we wanted Probably preferable to have our preliminary meeting first and then have the public hearing and for the public hearing

746
01:06:20,167 --> 01:06:37,113
[SPEAKER_14]: We need a quorum, but it's something that you can probably watch a video or read the minutes and We can have discussion about it afterward if everyone's not able to attend the hearing It's really a chance to at the City Council

747
01:06:37,974 --> 01:06:45,964
[SPEAKER_14]: No, this is, we're required under the CPA legislation to have a hearing once a year.

748
01:06:46,725 --> 01:06:54,855
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that, they don't spell it out exactly, but I think that the purpose of that hearing is to let the public tell us what the priorities are.

749
01:06:55,642 --> 01:06:56,363
[SPEAKER_09]: After the round?

750
01:06:56,963 --> 01:07:10,834
[SPEAKER_14]: After the round is completed, before the next application process, we'll collect public input so that we can tell the applicants what the criteria are for, that we're looking for, for the following round.

751
01:07:11,775 --> 01:07:13,556
[SPEAKER_14]: So then we will be able to

752
01:07:16,963 --> 01:07:19,925
[SPEAKER_14]: launch the next round of funding in January.

753
01:07:20,645 --> 01:07:35,414
[SPEAKER_14]: So we need to meet one more time after the, to approve the final application process and update of our criteria before we launch the round.

754
01:07:35,694 --> 01:07:42,978
[SPEAKER_14]: So we could make that approval in early to mid-January and then launch the funding round in later January.

755
01:07:44,968 --> 01:07:55,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing to keep in mind is I reached out to the Chevalier Theater folks, and they intend to submit an off-cycle application in November, probably.

756
01:07:56,413 --> 01:07:56,553
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

757
01:07:56,613 --> 01:07:56,853
[SPEAKER_14]: So.

758
01:07:57,213 --> 01:08:01,855
[SPEAKER_05]: And they still anticipate a mid-January deadline with Mass Cultural Council.

759
01:08:02,775 --> 01:08:04,216
[SPEAKER_05]: So we would have to build in.

760
01:08:04,576 --> 01:08:07,457
[SPEAKER_04]: So if we plan a meeting in December sometime, then that would.

761
01:08:07,477 --> 01:08:08,738
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like it would have to be December.

762
01:08:09,058 --> 01:08:09,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

763
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:09,978
[SPEAKER_14]: So we would.

764
01:08:10,178 --> 01:08:14,020
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if we have to schedule another meeting, or if you could just include that.

765
01:08:14,853 --> 01:08:15,654
[SPEAKER_05]: in the hearing?

766
01:08:15,694 --> 01:08:17,776
[SPEAKER_05]: We can include it.

767
01:08:17,836 --> 01:08:21,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we could include it if we do a December date, as long as, you know, it's on the agenda.

768
01:08:21,559 --> 01:08:22,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're okay.

769
01:08:23,581 --> 01:08:25,643
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's one more item of business.

770
01:08:26,404 --> 01:08:31,668
[SPEAKER_14]: Do we want to have that item of business at the same time as the hearing, or do we want the hearing to be?

771
01:08:31,768 --> 01:08:39,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I'm just wondering, I mean, I don't think, I'm not expecting there to be a lot of feedback at the hearing right now that we've done this a couple of times.

772
01:08:39,475 --> 01:08:41,137
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not like we're creating a new plan.

773
01:08:41,197 --> 01:08:42,018
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really just,

774
01:08:43,908 --> 01:08:44,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

775
01:08:44,148 --> 01:08:46,010
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, any course corrections.

776
01:08:46,470 --> 01:08:49,172
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't imagine that's going to be super interesting to a lot of people.

777
01:08:50,733 --> 01:09:07,765
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, where I expect to get more input is we also would like to have a meeting during the daytime that city staff can come to and invite the staff people to provide feedback on the process.

778
01:09:07,986 --> 01:09:12,229
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that the people who have been involved particularly in

779
01:09:12,909 --> 01:09:22,779
[SPEAKER_14]: So, managing the projects and helping to get the applications across the table to us will have a lot to say.

780
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:32,168
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I think we'll probably get more feedback on the application process than necessarily the criteria and priorities.

781
01:09:34,342 --> 01:09:48,593
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's one thing that we need to also be mindful of is that after we have crafted our recommendations we need to set up a Coordinated committee of the whole meeting to discuss remember like we did last year before the City Council meeting.

782
01:09:48,793 --> 01:09:59,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes so That's a separate so our timeline is what we've just laid out for what meetings we need to have coming up but in addition to that

783
01:10:01,183 --> 01:10:23,377
[SPEAKER_14]: We will, once we have approved the final language of our recommendations, we will immediately submit those to city council and the city council will want to have a committee of the whole meeting where they'll probably invite the applicants to present again for the city council's benefit.

784
01:10:24,277 --> 01:10:28,080
[SPEAKER_14]: And so there will be,

785
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:32,924
[SPEAKER_14]: meeting with the Committee of the Whole and then a City Council meeting to approve.

786
01:10:33,024 --> 01:10:43,554
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are two City Council meetings that committee members would be invited to attend, although it's not necessary if you aren't able to make it.

787
01:10:46,757 --> 01:10:48,939
[SPEAKER_14]: And so those will likely take place in November.

788
01:10:49,805 --> 01:10:52,950
[SPEAKER_09]: and captain because our recommendation meeting is on the 30th of October.

789
01:10:53,331 --> 01:10:53,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

790
01:10:54,132 --> 01:10:59,961
[SPEAKER_17]: If we stick to Tuesdays, there aren't a lot of Tuesdays in November that there's election day, which is a bad day to do anything.

791
01:10:59,981 --> 01:11:01,042
[SPEAKER_09]: We wouldn't do election day.

792
01:11:01,062 --> 01:11:02,505
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a week right after there are meetings.

793
01:11:02,545 --> 01:11:04,648
[SPEAKER_09]: You have one week and then it's Thanksgiving week.

794
01:11:05,448 --> 01:11:10,691
[SPEAKER_14]: So, November 13 is probably the date that we need to aim for our November meeting.

795
01:11:10,731 --> 01:11:11,572
[SPEAKER_17]: I would agree with that.

796
01:11:11,832 --> 01:11:30,303
[SPEAKER_17]: I was also going to ask, we had talked in previous meetings about revising our application process, incorporating that feedback into, after a few rounds, what were the questions raised, clarifications we know about, refining our process, not just what our goals are.

797
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:35,266
[SPEAKER_17]: are procedural things that would make it better and more understandable for candidates.

798
01:11:35,286 --> 01:11:35,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

799
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:40,609
[SPEAKER_17]: About what's in, what's out, you know, kind of FAQs, that kind of thing that would help the next round.

800
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:41,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Eligibility corner.

801
01:11:41,610 --> 01:11:41,910
[SPEAKER_14]: What's that?

802
01:11:42,150 --> 01:11:43,371
[SPEAKER_14]: The eligibility corner.

803
01:11:43,651 --> 01:11:43,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

804
01:11:44,352 --> 01:11:47,854
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so that's what we'll be talking about in November.

805
01:11:48,294 --> 01:12:12,982
[SPEAKER_14]: So, we have our discussion about what we'd like to update, and then we'll have the public hearing, and also a meeting, a stakeholder meeting, and then Danielle and I will work on drafting the revisions, and the committee will approve the final revisions likely in January.

806
01:12:14,162 --> 01:12:15,723
[SPEAKER_17]: So, is there a December meeting or not?

807
01:12:16,192 --> 01:12:28,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, well the December meeting then will be the hearing and that will also likely be when we would be asked to approve or make a recommendation for the off-cycle application for the Chevalier Theatre.

808
01:12:28,788 --> 01:12:30,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

809
01:12:33,934 --> 01:12:34,354
[SPEAKER_03]: December 11.

810
01:12:35,377 --> 01:12:37,098
[SPEAKER_14]: December 11th.

811
01:12:37,158 --> 01:12:38,219
[SPEAKER_03]: It's second Tuesday.

812
01:12:38,259 --> 01:12:39,380
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about four weeks.

813
01:12:39,701 --> 01:12:48,728
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, yeah, it's not too crazy to December 11th is for which one for the hearing and the annual Chevalier.

814
01:12:49,228 --> 01:12:51,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the annual hearing and the Chevalier theater.

815
01:13:01,729 --> 01:13:05,606
[SPEAKER_02]: So are we thinking will we hold that here or do we hold that at the DPW?

816
01:13:07,114 --> 01:13:10,795
[SPEAKER_14]: The hearing here might be a good idea.

817
01:13:10,815 --> 01:13:15,175
[SPEAKER_14]: What about the fire station?

818
01:13:16,336 --> 01:13:20,756
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, here is beneficial if we want to have it recorded.

819
01:13:20,796 --> 01:13:24,657
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the easiest place for us to have a meeting recorded.

820
01:13:26,317 --> 01:13:36,259
[SPEAKER_14]: And I feel as though it's good to use our cable media when we have something that is explicitly for the public's benefit.

821
01:13:37,728 --> 01:13:37,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

822
01:13:40,393 --> 01:14:05,319
[SPEAKER_14]: And we may be able to at that point, since we will have already had a discussion about what we see as potential revisions to the application process and criteria, we might be able to give a little bit of a presentation about what we did this year, what changes we're talking about, and then invite people to provide some input.

823
01:14:05,419 --> 01:14:10,020
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll give them information as well as asking them for input.

824
01:14:13,153 --> 01:14:24,357
[SPEAKER_09]: um all right great i think that that so we've got i think that over to october 9 october 30

825
01:14:30,743 --> 01:14:44,791
[SPEAKER_09]: November 13 possible committee the whole meeting and then they'll have to schedule us We'll have to go to some their council meeting their next council meeting likely which may be the 20th may not Yes week of Thanksgiving.

826
01:14:44,811 --> 01:14:47,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have anything scheduled on the 27th of November

827
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:59,832
[SPEAKER_14]: So none of the projects right now are in a hurry to get going.

828
01:14:59,933 --> 01:15:07,358
[SPEAKER_14]: So if the city council needs to take their time because the holidays get in the way,

829
01:15:10,278 --> 01:15:12,979
[SPEAKER_14]: We can, you know, it may not happen right away.

830
01:15:12,999 --> 01:15:13,359
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

831
01:15:13,499 --> 01:15:19,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to remember also, didn't Ann Marie say there was a sweet spot time of the year for us to be granting stuff?

832
01:15:19,341 --> 01:15:23,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it November after the CPA funding was?

833
01:15:24,583 --> 01:15:25,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.

834
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:29,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Like late October, early November is when DOR certifies the funds.

835
01:15:30,044 --> 01:15:33,445
[SPEAKER_05]: So best to make the awards after that.

836
01:15:33,545 --> 01:15:37,767
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're using known numbers instead of estimates.

837
01:15:39,222 --> 01:15:40,283
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the date, after what date?

838
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:42,444
[SPEAKER_14]: It was approximate.

839
01:15:42,464 --> 01:15:44,304
[SPEAKER_09]: It's approximate, November something.

840
01:15:44,805 --> 01:15:57,711
[SPEAKER_14]: However, since our requests for this round are so far below the available funding, I think that the margin of error is probably well within what we can do.

841
01:15:57,731 --> 01:15:58,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

842
01:15:59,111 --> 01:16:06,915
[SPEAKER_10]: Which leads me to my question, which is, on October 9th and 30th, do we think we need two meetings to do this?

843
01:16:08,308 --> 01:16:11,732
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we could make decisions and then finalize the language on the same meeting.

844
01:16:13,234 --> 01:16:18,259
[SPEAKER_17]: Because there are fewer and simpler summaries?

845
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:19,601
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we can try.

846
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:21,883
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we can't, then we'll just keep the other meeting.

847
01:16:22,824 --> 01:16:23,605
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good point.

848
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:25,648
[SPEAKER_14]: We can try and see what we do.

849
01:16:29,082 --> 01:16:33,088
[SPEAKER_08]: If Andre makes his magic motion in the first 30 seconds, we'll be out of there in seven minutes.

850
01:16:33,148 --> 01:16:34,089
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to have an omnibus.

851
01:16:34,109 --> 01:16:35,331
[SPEAKER_17]: A proposed language, look at this.

852
01:16:46,486 --> 01:16:47,968
[SPEAKER_17]: shortest meeting in history.

853
01:16:48,088 --> 01:17:06,928
[SPEAKER_14]: It was helpful the last time even though we had the second meeting because of the error that we made in the approvals, but it was also helpful to actually have written out what the language was going to be so that we

854
01:17:08,110 --> 01:17:22,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Because in writing it out, Danielle and I remembered some of the discussion and made sure that we incorporated the discussion about what were the important things that we wanted the projects to include.

855
01:17:24,242 --> 01:17:24,943
[SPEAKER_14]: in that agreement.

856
01:17:25,284 --> 01:17:35,517
[SPEAKER_14]: So we might be able to do it, but we might be able to have two short meetings instead of one long meeting where we try to perfect it, possibly.

857
01:17:36,979 --> 01:17:38,321
[SPEAKER_14]: But we'll see what we can do.

858
01:17:42,385 --> 01:17:55,010
[SPEAKER_14]: Perhaps you might be able to use a doodle poll to confirm everyone's availability, since not everyone is here this evening, to make sure that we can have a quorum for each of the nights that we've spelled out.

859
01:17:56,790 --> 01:18:02,893
[SPEAKER_14]: For now, we'll just include the nights that we've already discussed in that poll.

860
01:18:04,415 --> 01:18:07,960
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that concludes what we needed to cover this evening.

861
01:18:10,082 --> 01:18:11,624
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a motion to close the meeting?

862
01:18:11,945 --> 01:18:12,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to close the meeting?

863
01:18:13,527 --> 01:18:13,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

864
01:18:14,889 --> 01:18:15,509
[SPEAKER_14]: All in favor?

865
01:18:15,930 --> 01:18:16,330
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

866
01:18:17,011 --> 01:18:17,732
[SPEAKER_14]: Meeting is adjourned.
