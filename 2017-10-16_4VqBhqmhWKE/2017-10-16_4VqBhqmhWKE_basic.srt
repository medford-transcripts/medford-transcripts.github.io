Hello and welcome to our beautiful, state-of-the-art Community Media Center located within the Medford Vocational Technical High School campus. This studio encompasses all areas of access television, while incorporating courses for students in the new media technology program. We're thrilled to make this an inspiring, inclusive space for all to learn and have their voices heard.

To see this project come to fruition is a remarkable step forward for our students and a great opportunity for our community to get involved. Thank you to all those who helped this project come to completion. We're very excited to have the studio integrated once again with the high school where it all began. The voice of Medford will be heard again on the airways and it is so important to tell the story through the eyes of the people, not necessarily the professionals. I look forward to the success of our new community media center.
