1
00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:03,673
Because I just want to jump right into a lot of good stuff tonight.

2
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:06,094
So, let's go down the line.

3
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:08,154
Josh?

4
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:09,695
Present.

5
00:00:11,336 --> 00:00:11,656
Lois?

6
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:18,098
Yes, I see you.

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:20,199
Present.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,080
Muted.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,540
We'll work on that part.

10
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:23,761
Benji?

11
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:24,881
Here.

12
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:26,302
Perfect.

13
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:28,203
Loretta?

14
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:28,923
Here.

15
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:30,947
Kathleen.

16
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,592
I see you there.

17
00:00:36,612 --> 00:00:38,574
Uh, Luke.

18
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:42,497
I'm not seeing Luke.

19
00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:45,139
Just signed in perfect timing.

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:59,211
Uh, Dan Bob Jessica.

21
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:02,898
Not seeing Jessica.

22
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,320
John also not seeing.

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,822
Will is here and Paul.

24
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:17,145
Not here, but 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is perfect.

25
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:25,470
Did everyone have a chance to look over the minutes from last month?

26
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:27,839
I never received it.

27
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:30,159
Yeah, I'm in the same boat as Preetha.

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,200
Perfect.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,423
That's so helpful because it means that neither of you are on our MEC major mailer.

30
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:41,884
So I'll make sure that I add you right now.

31
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:42,905
Thank you.

32
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:44,805
That's interesting.

33
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:47,306
I'm on the Teams thing.

34
00:01:47,326 --> 00:01:50,868
I know you sent the Teams one, Brenda.

35
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:53,769
Yeah, and that's what it should have gone to.

36
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:58,754
I received some meek emails directly, but I haven't seen the minutes.

37
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:02,995
I think they were included with the agenda that Will put out for this meeting.

38
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:04,856
Yes, I usually put them out with the agenda.

39
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:10,237
The really scary part, it's always in the spam.

40
00:02:10,317 --> 00:02:12,678
Oh, is it in the OU water?

41
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:14,438
It always finds a way into spam.

42
00:02:15,038 --> 00:02:18,939
It happened to me for the first six months I've been here.

43
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,080
I've been fishing through spam trying to find it.

44
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,751
Every once in a while, it'll still happen, but double check.

45
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:28,653
I never received the final agenda, and it did not go to spam.

46
00:02:28,673 --> 00:02:30,254
I received the draft.

47
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:31,234
Oh.

48
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:34,136
Yes, there were no changes from the draft.

49
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:38,279
Yeah, I did not receive any notes to the agenda.

50
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,360
So the draft was the final.

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:40,840
OK.

52
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,420
Yes.

53
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:50,186
So acknowledging that some of us didn't receive it,

54
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:58,618
We can still potentially move it to a vote with some abstain ease, but we will be cognizant of that.

55
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:00,399
Oh, it is in the spam, found it.

56
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,740
Perfect.

57
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,102
That's good and bad, but mostly good.

58
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:06,043
It means that things are working.

59
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:06,944
Sorry.

60
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:15,130
So I would entertain a motion to accept those.

61
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:17,352
So moved.

62
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:22,899
Second.

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,860
Thank you.

64
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,041
Thank you, Bob.

65
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:27,443
I'll just run down the line here.

66
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:30,505
If you didn't get a chance to read it, no worries.

67
00:03:30,685 --> 00:03:32,287
We have abstained just for that reason.

68
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:33,968
And we'll get to next month.

69
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:36,310
All right, I'm going to run down the line.

70
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:37,711
Josh?

71
00:03:38,712 --> 00:03:39,092
Abstain.

72
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:41,654
Sorry.

73
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:41,974
Lois?

74
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:43,175
Accept.

75
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:45,457
Benji?

76
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:46,758
Accept.

77
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:48,739
Barry?

78
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,120
Yes.

79
00:03:51,702 --> 00:03:51,982
Loretta?

80
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:53,403
Abstain.

81
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:56,084
Kathleen.

82
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:01,486
Oh, I got a thumbs up.

83
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:02,427
I'll count it.

84
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:05,428
Rebita.

85
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:06,908
Abstain.

86
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:09,309
Dan.

87
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:10,750
Accept.

88
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:14,831
Still no Jessica.

89
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:15,731
John.

90
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:16,252
Will.

91
00:04:16,432 --> 00:04:16,832
I accept.

92
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,555
And no Paul either.

93
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:24,116
So the yeas have it, six to three, abstain, yeas.

94
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:26,897
Let's get started then.

95
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:27,918
This is Bob Payne.

96
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:29,579
I don't think you called me, but I'll accept the two.

97
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,219
Oh my goodness.

98
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:38,002
I also, by the way, Will, I sent you some notes about having updates on the committee member bios.

99
00:04:41,242 --> 00:04:47,427
Yes, that was my first of two little administrative updates I wanted to open with.

100
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:57,415
Bob helpfully pointed out that we got two new members and some members no longer with us, and we need to make sure our bios are up to date.

101
00:04:58,075 --> 00:05:04,800
I know my bio was written a little over a year ago and could not be further from the truth of what I do now.

102
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:09,864
Would be really helpful reminder for everyone, send in some updates.

103
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:16,014
Brenda, where's a good place we can send that before we just flood your inbox.

104
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:18,275
Oh, feel free to just flood my inbox.

105
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,415
That's fine.

106
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:21,336
Yes.

107
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:23,237
Um, but let me see.

108
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:30,681
There's a. You can check out what we currently have for your bio on our.

109
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:37,444
Home page for this committee and I will just drop that link into the chat.

110
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,300
But plus, the agenda used to have it.

111
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,681
The minutes have it, I believe.

112
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:43,521
Or something has it.

113
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,341
So actually, it's interesting.

114
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,642
The agenda that's actually posted doesn't have the bios.

115
00:05:50,302 --> 00:05:53,983
So I'm not sure what the purpose is of them in the agenda.

116
00:05:56,203 --> 00:06:00,024
So I think, really, the bios are just on that home page on the website.

117
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:04,525
There he is.

118
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:05,345
Wow.

119
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:11,829
We'll get that sorted, so please update your bios if you need to.

120
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:14,650
If not, you know, keep doing what you're doing.

121
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:24,132
The other piece of administrative work was I would love to get a hybrid meeting for our next session.

122
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:27,672
I believe that is March 3rd.

123
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,563
I would love to see some of you in person.

124
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:39,985
I think that's really nice and makes for more meaningful conversation.

125
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:45,748
But as always, we'll leave that Zoom window open so that we can have those hybrid guests as well.

126
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:50,410
Just something I wanted to put on your radar.

127
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,432
And if you have really strong feelings against it, please let me know.

128
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:59,815
But otherwise, I would love to move for a hybrid meeting next month, March 3rd.

129
00:07:04,828 --> 00:07:08,091
Other than that, those are my 2 little tidbits of housekeeping.

130
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:12,174
I'd love to throw it over to Brenda.

131
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:17,599
To talk about our municipal updates are electrifying Medford all that good stuff.

132
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:20,235
Right.

133
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,597
Yeah, well, let's start with Electrify Medford.

134
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:27,158
So far, we have 113 people who've signed up for it.

135
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:29,059
42 have been coached.

136
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:36,683
We did an info session at the library on the 16th of January.

137
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,864
And that went really well.

138
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:41,565
We had a little presentation, and then we split up into

139
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:49,828
to little one-on-one coaching sessions around the room with people so we could do their coaching sessions right then.

140
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:51,949
And that seemed to work really well.

141
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:54,350
So we're going to do more of those moving forward.

142
00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:06,375
I already have one set up at the senior center at the beginning of March, and I'm working on scheduling one at the West Medford Community Center as well.

143
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:17,685
I'm also looking for other locations around the city, places like that, where people are gathering, that would be good locations for something like that.

144
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:20,748
So if you have any suggestions, please let me know.

145
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:24,171
Places that we should be doing these info sessions.

146
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:41,263
We're also planning to have some door hangers that we're going to be putting out in March and working with a marketing professor at Northeastern actually who lives in Medford.

147
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,765
who's helping to prepare the message for it.

148
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:49,126
We're going to do some A-B testing to see the best messaging for them.

149
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:58,989
And then we're actually going to have some Northeastern students who are going to be going door to door, not knocking on people's doors, but just putting the door hangers up.

150
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:05,051
So that should be a good influx of people signing up in March.

151
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:14,674
Um, and then for the mass save community 1st partnership, part of this, um, that training was rescheduled for April 4th.

152
00:09:15,415 --> 00:09:19,198
Um, just because their 3 year plan hasn't been approved yet.

153
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:20,919
It'll be approved at the end of this month.

154
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,701
Um, so.

155
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:29,166
I'm looking forward to that just to get some updates directly from the horse's mouth.

156
00:09:33,577 --> 00:09:38,961
Oh, I see in the chat, someone saying the energy group photo on the website is extremely old.

157
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:39,562
Yes.

158
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,384
So we could use a replacement photo.

159
00:09:43,845 --> 00:09:44,165
Yes.

160
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:50,390
Yes, it would be great to schedule a time when everyone is going to be together so that we could do that.

161
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:05,445
Um, let's see what else oh, the Andrews and McGlynn HVAC project is moving along.

162
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:12,850
We are going to be getting proposals from construction managers this week.

163
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:23,616
And then we'll be working, then we'll be meeting with our selection committee to choose 1 and then onboarding them so that we can preorder the equipment that has some really long lead time.

164
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,597
So we can get that installed this summer.

165
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:33,312
Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it's going to be ordered before tariffs hit, but we tried.

166
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:39,018
The tariffs are off for a month.

167
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:40,659
Oh, are they?

168
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:40,739
Yes.

169
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:52,145
Yep, well, maybe we can get through all of that in a month and get the equipment pre-ordered.

170
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:59,349
It seems like it will probably be mid-March before we actually get the pre-order in for them, but we'll see.

171
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:11,862
Um, we are planning to do a plug load audit at the library because the electricity use has been a lot higher than we anticipated.

172
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:21,727
It hasn't actually been a net 0. so we did some work with the building automation system, changing some schedules.

173
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:28,054
But we're still seeing increased energy usage compared to what we expected.

174
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:31,079
So we think that might be a plug load issue.

175
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:33,002
So we're going to do a plug load audit for that.

176
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:41,833
Um, and oh, I wanted to highlight for this group that the.

177
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:49,457
Community development board and the city council are looking as part of the zoning overhaul that's happening.

178
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:52,538
They're looking at implementing a green score.

179
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,099
And that's really focusing on, um.

180
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:03,829
It's really sort of a stormwater issue, but in a more of a natural way.

181
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:11,071
And actually, let me share my screen here so you can take a look at what this looks like.

182
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:21,655
Can you see the...

183
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:26,788
There we go.

184
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:28,089
See the Excel spreadsheet?

185
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:30,850
Yes.

186
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:47,014
The idea of the green score is to have a flexible way for larger buildings and buildings in flood zones to have more permeable surface on their property.

187
00:12:49,925 --> 00:13:02,566
And the way of doing that is there's going to be a particular score that they have to meet, and then there are different ways they can do it, different types of plants, green roofs.

188
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:17,089
Vegetated walls, permeable paving, and based on the combination of items that they have on their property, then it would add up to the score that they have to meet.

189
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:26,492
And this is for areas that are in FEMA flood zones and buildings that have to go through site plan review.

190
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:35,090
So, those are buildings over 10,000 square feet or 6 units and there are some other requirements as well.

191
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,972
There are things like parking lots and gas stations and things like that that would also have to go through it.

192
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:47,716
But this is something that's being discussed at this Wednesday's community development board meeting.

193
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:52,799
And then after that, it would go back to to city council.

194
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:56,733
Frederick, I have a question.

195
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:58,494
Oh, yeah, just a second.

196
00:13:58,514 --> 00:14:00,114
Barry, I saw you raised your hand there.

197
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:00,755
All right.

198
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:10,657
Yeah, I'm wondering how the green roof is compatible with the solar roof ordinance.

199
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:18,240
And I also thought that there was going to be some additional solar roof

200
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:29,307
stipulations that would get additional points.

201
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:30,948
And I don't see that on here.

202
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:34,911
So I'm a bit puzzled about both of those things.

203
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:37,233
Not for this.

204
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:40,615
The green roof is really focused on stormwater.

205
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:43,977
Sorry, the green score is really focused on stormwater.

206
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:47,940
Green roofs and solar are

207
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:58,681
quite compatible in that the green roof lowers the temperature and actually makes the solar more efficient.

208
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:04,286
Now, there could be potentially a weight issue with having both of those things on the roof.

209
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:07,409
And so that's something that would have to be considered while it's being designed.

210
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,153
But it's, yeah, they're definitely compatible.

211
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:19,640
Loretta, what were you saying?

212
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:32,669
I was curious about, this is for large-scale projects, what about, could it be considered for smaller, like for three families, any development in the city?

213
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:38,213
It was discussed for small-scale projects, but the thought was that it was too,

214
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,632
complicated for smaller building owners to do.

215
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:58,616
And so really, it was sort of a balancing act between the complexity of it and covering as much as we could.

216
00:15:58,636 --> 00:16:01,117
It's interesting.

217
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:02,697
OK.

218
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:05,578
Thank you.

219
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:08,359
Will, did you have a comment?

220
00:16:08,854 --> 00:16:10,655
Yeah, I had two quick ones.

221
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:17,817
One is, uh, if you were at Liberty to send this to us, uh, cause if they're hearing this on Wednesday, I'd love to.

222
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:25,140
Read about it and maybe potentially speak for or against it, depending on how weird, how we're feeling.

223
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,981
Yeah, absolutely.

224
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:32,383
And this is in the public, um, folder for, I can drop the link in the chat.

225
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:38,025
It's in the public folder for the, uh, community development board meeting materials.

226
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:43,695
Fantastic, thank you.

227
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:49,377
And actually, that mostly clears up what I'm looking for.

228
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:50,578
So actually, I'm almost set.

229
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:50,898
Thank you.

230
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:51,638
Great.

231
00:16:54,559 --> 00:17:02,402
And I see Josh also uses a green score during development review, and he linked to Somerville's green score.

232
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:05,683
Yes, we copy Somerville a lot.

233
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:11,450
It works really well and is good for our green roofs work.

234
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,352
So hopefully, that's a reassuring case study.

235
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:19,834
That's great.

236
00:17:19,854 --> 00:17:19,974
Yeah.

237
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:24,236
And we looked at the green scores that other municipalities had as we were putting this together.

238
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:31,699
And we worked with the same zoning consultant who's doing the rest of the zoning overhaul for this as well.

239
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:37,604
Is there a requirement for the score level?

240
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:42,206
And if they don't meet it, do they have to pay any fees?

241
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:49,329
And is this something volunteered by the design people?

242
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:52,631
Or how does that work?

243
00:17:53,852 --> 00:17:57,833
Yeah, this is something that they would put together and submit to us.

244
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:03,056
And then our department would be reviewing it.

245
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:07,097
So there must be some minimal threshold.

246
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:08,117
Yes, there is.

247
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:16,780
It doesn't really have any meaning, I think, but there's, let me see here.

248
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,882
It doesn't have any meaning just in terms of basic numbers here, but I can share that portion of the.

249
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:27,048
of that as well here.

250
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:31,433
Or you can click through and you can see this yourself.

251
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:41,926
So yes, there's a minimum green score and then there's an ideal of what we're looking for and we're hoping to push developers to.

252
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:55,377
Can you remind me 1 more time, which is on Wednesday, which meeting will this be.

253
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:58,700
Discuss that it's the community development board.

254
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:16,311
They've been getting a lot of attention lately because the zoning of the Salem Street corridor has been controversial.

255
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:25,154
This was actually supposed to be discussed at their last meeting, but it got continued because the Salem Street conversation went on for so long.

256
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:40,369
Um, let's see what else here.

257
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,372
Um, oh, we're updating our hazard mitigation plan.

258
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:47,116
Um, this is something that's supposed to be updated every 5 years.

259
00:19:47,256 --> 00:19:48,277
And our last update was 2017.

260
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:48,577
So.

261
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:55,504
Definitely something to to get on, um, you know, if we'll still have a FEMA.

262
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:10,983
So we had our first public meeting for that last week, and then there are going to be focus groups and surveys to come to gain feedback from the public.

263
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:15,188
We're especially looking for people to give feedback on what

264
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:32,256
if there are areas where they're seeing issues right now, especially with stormwater flooding, any other sort of hazards that they're seeing, if there are, I don't know, if there are power issues in particular areas or something like that.

265
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:34,637
Things for people to think about.

266
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:41,620
And then also what they would be looking for from the city in terms of

267
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:53,669
You know, what would be useful to them for the, for the city to be doing that's really going to be a lot of the focus of the, the public meetings and the focus groups and surveys.

268
00:20:54,270 --> 00:21:04,519
So, then the 2nd, public meeting is going to be in June and then the consultant will have done had time to put together something to present about what's going to be.

269
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,927
Sort of included like a first draft of the of the plan that that people can take a look at they're going to be maps that people can really focus in on.

270
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:18,853
And then getting feedback from that they'll have a final public meeting in in September.

271
00:21:20,374 --> 00:21:22,156
showing the the finished product.

272
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:29,749
Um, let's see what else here.

273
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:32,972
Oh, we have a couple of events coming up.

274
00:21:33,953 --> 00:21:36,235
Uh, well, this year, later this year.

275
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:43,280
Um, so the rain, our, we, our annual rain barrel pickup is scheduled for May 14th.

276
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:50,066
Um, and that happens at the high school, um, in the evening.

277
00:21:53,487 --> 00:22:04,136
And so we'll be sending out information to people before that so that people can order their rain barrels and then they can just come pick them up that day.

278
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,181
And then we have a date for the Harvest Your Energy Festival.

279
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:15,446
Rain barrel thing would be advertised, right, in the monthly newsletter.

280
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:15,807
Okay.

281
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:16,647
Yes, it will be.

282
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:17,328
I need one.

283
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:19,350
Definitely, yeah.

284
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:26,558
And we're always looking for volunteers for the rain barrel pickup.

285
00:22:26,598 --> 00:22:33,584
We tend to have a lot of people showing up that day and we have a long line of cars that we're trying to move through quickly.

286
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:37,827
So it's always helpful to have people from the Energy Committee helping out there too.

287
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,893
But Harvest Your Energy Festival, October 18th is the date for that.

288
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:51,458
As expected, it's the weekend after, it's a Saturday after Indigenous Peoples Day.

289
00:23:00,424 --> 00:23:09,072
And then I think the last thing that I wanted to mention is that we're planning to apply for a mass clean energy center on street.

290
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:16,939
Charging grant, so this would be similar to the EV chargers.

291
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,123
In are in the city parking lots right now, except we would be choosing locations.

292
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:34,776
Um, on the on the with street parking where we would have those, and this is a grant where 100% of the cost is covered by mass clean energy center, including maintenance for the, for the 1st, few years.

293
00:23:36,277 --> 00:23:41,783
And that's for, I think they said around 3 charging sites per municipality.

294
00:23:46,616 --> 00:23:53,161
And Josh, I want to chat with you about that in a little more detail, actually, because I think Somerville is planning to apply for that as well, right?

295
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:56,163
And yeah, I submitted it the other week.

296
00:23:56,763 --> 00:23:57,344
Oh, great.

297
00:23:57,504 --> 00:24:00,626
OK, do you have do you have sites that you've worked on?

298
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:02,527
We don't have sites selected yet.

299
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:02,767
No.

300
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:12,454
OK, well, yeah, happy to talk about it offline or, you know, we could also consider submitting for the like planning side of it, not the like

301
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:22,382
Not that that necessarily adds more sites and more charging infrastructure, but getting a site strategy sets us up for some pretty solid success.

302
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:24,748
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

303
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:44,868
And the other thing that we are still a little bit up in the air at the moment is whether we're looking to do the expedited pathway, which has a particular set of chargers that they use, which are the flow chargers, or do a custom option with charge point chargers, because that's what we have already.

304
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:54,804
I think some initial feedback I've gotten internally is just the expedited pathway in order to just speed up the process.

305
00:24:55,464 --> 00:25:01,352
Although I would love to keep everything on one system to make it easier for me to maintain it.

306
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:07,144
But yeah, Josh, let's, let's connect about this.

307
00:25:08,725 --> 00:25:22,136
Um, so hopefully we got reassurances that the difference between expedited and custom, but where you just switch manufacturers was not going to be a major slow, uh, slow down, uh, during that, like info session that you and I were on a couple of weeks ago.

308
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:25,518
Yeah.

309
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:25,999
Yeah.

310
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:31,243
It wasn't, I wasn't clear that it was going to be quite the, yeah, quite the same, but yeah.

311
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:39,812
And that's it for my updates.

312
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:44,398
Any questions, comments on any of that?

313
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,580
I know I ran through that quickly.

314
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:56,624
I thought it was great, filled out my calendar really nicely.

315
00:25:57,785 --> 00:26:08,146
And I will send out some reminders, hopefully the month before each one, to round up some volunteers, maybe a little sooner for Harvester Energy.

316
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,827
That's usually a bit of a lift.

317
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:13,207
But good things to have on our radar, ready to go.

318
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:23,109
And with that, I'm actually going to turn it over to Barry for a quick introduction of our speaker.

319
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:25,426
Cool.

320
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:31,369
Well, everybody knows that yesterday was February 2nd, Groundhog's Day.

321
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:54,282
And in honor of Groundhog's Day, I am delighted to introduce my friend, hiking partner, and neighbor, Matt Barlow, who, in addition to being a damn good naturalist and an all-around good guy, is also a climate scientist of some renown.

322
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,176
So let's see, reading my notes here.

323
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:09,400
A meteorologist, an expert on drought, precipitation, and water cycles, but not necessarily about whether winter will end in six weeks or not.

324
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:12,982
Matt teaches at UMass Lowell.

325
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:24,286
He was a lead author for the chapter on water cycle changes for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's sixth assessment report in 2022.

326
00:27:26,783 --> 00:27:34,508
And he's also the extreme precipitation team leader for the 2022 Greater Boston Climate Assessment.

327
00:27:35,568 --> 00:27:37,830
And this is Matt's second visit to our group.

328
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,592
And Matt, if I got anything wrong there, correct me.

329
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:43,727
No, that was great.

330
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,389
Thank you very much for that kind introduction.

331
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:49,630
And thanks very much for having me, folks.

332
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:55,313
So as some of you may know, I'm a Medford resident, but I work in Lowell.

333
00:27:55,433 --> 00:28:01,316
So I hope you'll forgive me some divided loyalties a little bit in what I talk about today.

334
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:10,921
And I did just see on the TV that two out of two groundhogs agree that their shadow has been seen.

335
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:19,066
So going by the groundhog forecast, there's what, six more weeks of winter?

336
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:27,150
There's some hints in the stratosphere that we may not be done with winter as well, but that would be a whole other

337
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:30,129
presentation.

338
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:33,690
So I'm going to see if I can share my screen.

339
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:55,471
have I managed to successfully share my screen?

340
00:28:55,992 --> 00:28:56,912
You are golden.

341
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:57,253
Yes.

342
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:05,919
Yeah, I like to keep like 50 things open on my home page or my desktop, so I have no idea actually what I'm sharing.

343
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:19,068
And I'm hoping to keep this a little short so we can have some time for discussion because I'm very much interested in what you guys are thinking about as well.

344
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:27,974
So I wanted to talk just briefly about climate and energy issues at the city and neighborhood level in Massachusetts.

345
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,341
which is something that we've been thinking about.

346
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:45,903
So the two things that I wanted to cover tonight is we have a new Department of Energy funded Climate Resilience Center in Lowell, specifically to look at energy and climate change.

347
00:29:46,423 --> 00:29:53,585
And I think a lot of the issues there parallel, you know, issues in most areas of the country.

348
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:57,267
cities and towns in Massachusetts.

349
00:29:57,287 --> 00:30:04,551
So, you know, wanted to sort of update you on what we're thinking about a little bit and hear, you know, what the parallels are.

350
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:13,697
And then the Massachusetts is just starting its next iteration of its climate science report.

351
00:30:13,717 --> 00:30:27,460
So the physical climate science piece, the climate projections piece of the Massachusetts report cycle that then feeds in, I think, into the big next update to the vulnerability plan in two years, I think.

352
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,441
So the climate science report is just starting to spin up now.

353
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:46,510
So I'm also looking for any feedback or input on what might be useful from your perspective in terms of what the state should be covering in that report.

354
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,372
I'm not leading that, but I am a contributor.

355
00:30:51,982 --> 00:31:02,592
This is our new center with a very unwieldy name, the Massachusetts Gateway City's Climate Resilience Center Powering a Just and Resilient Future.

356
00:31:04,974 --> 00:31:30,851
many words that are probably now going to be banned, and with a focus primarily on Lowell, but with an eye towards being able to scale everything we do to other, especially gateway cities, but other, you know, similar sized, kind of mid-sized post-industrial cities in New England, led by our own Professor Rooney Varga and involving several other folks.

357
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:36,565
So we're trying to do a couple of different things.

358
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:44,229
This is sort of pretty ambitious in scope, not in funding, but in scope anyway.

359
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:53,615
So we're trying to span going from understanding better about the hot and cold temperature extremes that might be

360
00:31:55,015 --> 00:32:17,611
affecting the city and then link that both toward to urban green space, how urban canopy and urban green spaces, rainwater gardens, things like that may be able to mitigate some of the temperature extremes, and then also some energy modeling.

361
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:35,986
And that's not my piece of this, so I'm still on the steep part of the learning curve, but trying to estimate for individual homes during temperature extremes what that might do to their energy costs.

362
00:32:37,046 --> 00:33:00,685
If say, they took advantage of mass save to put in energy efficiency or put in a heat pump or network geothermal, try to run through some of the options and see what that looks like at the energy cost level for an individual, but also start to understand a little bit about the peak power demands as the energy system gets more electrified.

363
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:10,911
And then another big piece of this project is to co-develop a lot of this work with the city of Lowell and community members.

364
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:30,863
So we're in regular contact with, you know, folks from the planning office, folks at senior centers, folks at the Cambodian Mutual Aid Association to try to make sure that we're providing information that's sort of actionable and equitable.

365
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:44,906
So one of the things that we're thinking about, which I think everybody's thinking a lot about, is the green energy transition in Massachusetts.

366
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:58,810
My understanding is that the Massachusetts target is to add about half a million heat pumps in the next five years, which is a pretty huge switch.

367
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:03,692
The good news, of course, is that switching to electric heat pumps

368
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:19,104
from gas is at least hypothetically great for decarbonization, probably for indoor air quality as well, but it does put additional stress on the electric grid.

369
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,689
So that's something that we want to understand a little bit.

370
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:42,444
And then just to address the sort of literal elephant in the room there, if you'll pardon my slide, the green energy transition, if you transition, of course, to energy production via electricity, that's only green if the electricity is produced with non-fossil fuels.

371
00:34:43,245 --> 00:34:47,568
And now our wind energy permitting for the state is in limbo.

372
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:50,110
So that's, I think, a pretty big

373
00:34:51,130 --> 00:35:01,584
Question mark piece of this curious to hear if anybody has any opinions on that, but it just seems to be a pretty big question mark at the moment and then also.

374
00:35:03,205 --> 00:35:20,557
With that increased load, I've heard different estimates, but we'd have to need to substantially build out our regional grid capacity maybe by a factor of two or something approaching that over five years, which is a pretty heavy lift.

375
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:27,262
And my understanding is that was also planned to be or expected to be dependent on federal funds.

376
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:37,231
all the federal uncertainty adding a lot of, passing on a lot of uncertainty to this.

377
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:43,279
But one of the things that we're interested in is temperature extremes for this project.

378
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:49,161
That's our focus from the climate side of view, but not just heat extremes, but also cold extremes.

379
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:59,045
We're definitely having fewer cold extremes, but we can't quite shut the door on them just yet in this past

380
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:08,732
Last month was a pretty good example around the eastern US of still getting some pretty good cold temperatures.

381
00:36:08,952 --> 00:36:13,556
Not cold enough for Barry and for my wife, who are really rooting for some snow.

382
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:28,024
still certainly going to create an issue in terms of, I think the expectation is that peak electric loads are expected to shift from summer to winter as we continue to electrify.

383
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:36,027
And then, of course, blackouts, if you're depending on electricity for your heating, blackouts are a much more immediate

384
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:41,029
much higher impact scenario in winter than they would be in summer.

385
00:36:41,630 --> 00:37:04,162
So we're trying to understand a little bit about what these plausible worst case scenarios might look like for heat waves and cold snaps, but then also model the energy response to that, as well as what the potential is to mitigate some of that with maybe increased urban canopy

386
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:22,477
Other approaches, this isn't part of that particular project, but something that our campus is very interested in, and some other municipalities around the state, I think Worcester has been a leader in this maybe, is network geothermal.

387
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:47,602
So ground source heat pumps instead of air source heat pumps, which are more energy efficient and may be able to take good advantage of existing infrastructure, but provide some challenges in terms of getting neighborhood buy-in and some of the costs involved.

388
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:51,763
But we do have a project that's getting underway on campus

389
00:37:55,763 --> 00:38:05,585
heat and cool some of our buildings and one of the abutting environmental justice communities in Lowell as well, if all goes well.

390
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:11,666
The picture shows drilling the wells on the parking lot.

391
00:38:11,686 --> 00:38:13,086
That part has gone smoothly.

392
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:20,388
Everything else is challenging, and I think I've heard from community members that

393
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:35,595
they would like more sort of local input into energy production and that working with a large private company is challenging.

394
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,225
Framingham, I think somebody is pointing out the completed network.

395
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:45,188
Yeah, Framingham, not Worcester, I guess.

396
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:46,149
Yeah, thank you for that.

397
00:38:47,031 --> 00:38:53,921
Yeah, I think they've had some challenges, but I think it's been a very nice project there.

398
00:38:57,616 --> 00:39:11,067
Another thing that we're thinking about is the new risk environments in a couple of different ways, but I think one that's really stood out this year was the wildfire season.

399
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:24,558
And we're hoping this summer to sort of have a closer look at the climate drivers of this past summer and what that might say about

400
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:31,042
future wildfire seasons in Massachusetts.

401
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:39,684
You've probably heard the term weather whiplash, where we have hot and then cold, sort of back to back.

402
00:39:40,064 --> 00:39:51,487
This past year, last year was a good example of water whiplash, where one month was record wet, and then the next month was record dry, and then the next month was record wet.

403
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:56,969
And so that increase in variability is expected with climate change.

404
00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:06,413
And we just happened to roll bad dice and get a couple of really dry months right in a row in the fall and paid the price in wildfire.

405
00:40:06,453 --> 00:40:18,478
So we're trying to understand whether that was more of a one-off season or more of something that we may experience more frequently in the future.

406
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:31,533
We're trying to work with our community partners to understand better how to communicate climate change.

407
00:40:32,073 --> 00:40:42,215
And as Barry said, I've been involved with the IPCC reports and the Boston report, and now the state report.

408
00:40:42,695 --> 00:40:47,217
And we know a lot of ways of communicating climate risk that don't work.

409
00:40:49,257 --> 00:40:50,057
to communities.

410
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:55,118
So we're struggling a little bit to figure out what does work.

411
00:40:55,698 --> 00:41:13,321
And I think what we're finding, which we kind of knew, but really getting reinforced that, of course, if you're looking in a highly impacted community, which are typically your environmental justice communities, your lower income neighborhoods, things like that, they, of course, have other very big concerns on their mind.

412
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:14,721
You know, what's up with my job?

413
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:16,062
What's up with my kid's school?

414
00:41:17,662 --> 00:41:18,502
So they're not

415
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:46,502
really in a position to appreciate the degree that anybody is who isn't a climate scientist, different scenarios and things like percentage change and intense rainfall at different warming levels, but more, do I need to worry about flood risk on my street, which is actually a much harder question to answer, but we're trying to get a better handle on

416
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:58,334
the information that's available to us, how do we best and most usefully get it across to the folks who can make best use of it?

417
00:41:58,955 --> 00:42:02,980
And then another big piece of that is that the scale of actionable information

418
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:10,489
The information that people would like is usually street level or property level or neighborhood they want to know.

419
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:16,756
We all want to know what's going to happen in my backyard, what's going to happen in my neighborhood.

420
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:25,024
And that spatial scale, tens of meters, is typically much smaller than the available information.

421
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:36,238
So the National Climate Assessment, the national process provides a fair amount of data at the county level is about the smallest they go.

422
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:46,802
And the current plan for projections from the state, the projections that are currently in process are also county level.

423
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:50,043
so not neighborhood level.

424
00:42:50,643 --> 00:43:16,450
And the difficulty is that filling some of that information gap in is possible in some cases, but it's a scale that's very difficult to find funding for because it's typically a little expensive on the city side, especially for smaller cities, but it's not typically the type of thing you can ask for federal research funds because they don't,

425
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:21,073
want to fund research that's true for one city or a handful of cities.

426
00:43:21,113 --> 00:43:24,877
They want to fund research for the whole Northeast or something like that.

427
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:30,742
So there's this kind of critical information gap that exists.

428
00:43:30,982 --> 00:43:35,146
And I'll show a slide of that in a minute.

429
00:43:35,926 --> 00:43:44,293
But this is some of the feedback that we've gotten from community members in terms of the climate information,

430
00:43:45,807 --> 00:43:59,692
The climate information they're looking for really isn't directly, they don't want the climate information directly in terms of temperature levels or precipitation levels, but how does it factor into the impacts of climate change?

431
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:13,056
And I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't already know, but people are less concerned in percentage change in the number of days over 95 degrees Fahrenheit or something like that and more

432
00:44:14,508 --> 00:44:21,194
Do I need to worry this summer about arranging childcare because the school is going to be closed?

433
00:44:21,214 --> 00:44:27,419
A question that we got recently is, do I need to worry about fire insurance?

434
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:35,225
Are these risks starting to become large relative to the very immediate concerns that folks have?

435
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:39,409
How much do I need to worry about a spike in energy cost?

436
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:48,076
Do I need to have an AC just as a matter of health?

437
00:44:48,296 --> 00:44:59,582
If you have an older person in your house, but your income is very limited, an AC may feel like a luxury, but may not actually be a luxury in some cases.

438
00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:05,744
which sort of relates again to these kind of spatial scales.

439
00:45:06,786 --> 00:45:13,378
I imagine everybody's heard of the urban heat island effect if you're in a part of the city that's heavily paved with very few trees.

440
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:32,166
Typically, those parts of the cities that were redlined historically and are lower income areas of the cities, the typically less desirable parts of the cities, those parts of the cities can be 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 degrees warmer during a heat wave.

441
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:34,527
So really substantially warmer.

442
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:42,368
This is showing you some results for Boston overlapping the hottest parts of the city with children

443
00:45:44,027 --> 00:45:48,310
where there are a lot of children, where there are older adults, where there are medical illnesses.

444
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:54,553
So it kind of matters at this neighborhood level where it's going to be really hot.

445
00:45:55,894 --> 00:46:00,997
It's really important information to have in terms of understanding impacts.

446
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:04,319
And Boston.

447
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:12,068
Has some of this info and a few towns, I'm going to say Worcester again, hopefully correctly.

448
00:46:12,088 --> 00:46:22,357
I think this time Worcester, I think, did some mapping to try to understand what the hottest neighborhoods were, but most towns don't.

449
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:32,950
It's probably possible to create this information for every town in Massachusetts, but it doesn't currently exist.

450
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:38,134
And Boston has a much larger budget, so they commissioned a very large study.

451
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:46,647
It's probably possible to get that information from satellite data, or at least to make an estimate.

452
00:46:47,147 --> 00:46:54,309
This is a map of the urban heat island effect all over Massachusetts using satellite data.

453
00:46:54,809 --> 00:47:00,791
This is mainly meant to be an artistic map, so it doesn't actually have values on it.

454
00:47:01,472 --> 00:47:03,652
But I think it does give some flavor

455
00:47:05,973 --> 00:47:12,315
And I think the difference between the yellow areas and the dark green areas is like 20 degrees or more.

456
00:47:14,275 --> 00:47:21,837
So if you're in Western Mass in a valley with a lot of trees, even a heat wave isn't necessarily all that hot.

457
00:47:21,997 --> 00:47:23,718
But if you're in Springfield,

458
00:47:26,587 --> 00:47:31,150
in an area with very few trees is going to be a much bigger deal.

459
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:38,333
So there are some opportunities here to try to make this kind of information available to more towns.

460
00:47:41,134 --> 00:47:44,656
And we're trying to figure out a way to get that done.

461
00:47:44,716 --> 00:47:48,318
But so far, I don't know if Medford has done that or not, to be honest.

462
00:47:48,638 --> 00:47:50,719
Lowell doesn't have this information, I know for sure.

463
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,863
But it is probably possible to make it.

464
00:47:54,903 --> 00:47:56,765
It's a question of capacity.

465
00:47:58,486 --> 00:47:59,087
So I'll just end.

466
00:47:59,107 --> 00:48:04,793
And again, I wanted to hopefully have some time for discussion and hear from you guys a little bit more.

467
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:12,962
I just wanted to end on this note of the state climate report is being scoped right now in terms of what it will cover.

468
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:17,107
Resources as with everything are very limited.

469
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:30,421
So, you know, in terms of what it can cover will be limited, but it's certainly better to ask for what's needed because there may be some capacity.

470
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:31,662
And then also, I think,

471
00:48:33,263 --> 00:48:36,184
Massachusetts has a relatively new state climate office.

472
00:48:37,224 --> 00:48:46,146
The state climate report's going to be a bigger deal this time around, and then I expect the next time around will be much bigger even than this.

473
00:48:46,266 --> 00:49:02,350
So if there's information that would be very useful at the municipal level, I think the more the state knows that, the more, if it can't do anything quickly, the more it can at least think about that in the medium term.

474
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:07,991
And I think I'll go ahead and end it there.

475
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:15,293
I'm definitely happy for any comments or questions or discussion.

476
00:49:15,313 --> 00:49:22,854
I see Dan.

477
00:49:22,894 --> 00:49:23,314
Go for it.

478
00:49:24,614 --> 00:49:25,875
Yeah, thanks, Matthew.

479
00:49:25,915 --> 00:49:27,495
That was incredibly helpful.

480
00:49:28,488 --> 00:49:28,928
Interesting.

481
00:49:29,128 --> 00:49:30,349
Thank you for presenting.

482
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:32,290
Thank you.

483
00:49:33,091 --> 00:49:50,983
One of the big things I took from that though is that a lot of people in our communities are worried about things like their utility bills or costs like reliability of service.

484
00:49:51,723 --> 00:49:57,387
I'm interested how some of this plays into some of the larger regional

485
00:49:58,211 --> 00:49:59,392
and national things going on.

486
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:19,848
So things like the central main corridor, you know, getting hydro power down here, you know, nuclear power, um, or even like, you know, gas, um, you know, opposition to gas, um, transmission lines coming up here.

487
00:50:19,928 --> 00:50:25,172
So like, how can we, you know, maybe communicate some, uh,

488
00:50:27,972 --> 00:50:37,042
Or make sure that people feel comfortable about like kind of near term reliability verse how that impacts longer term climate goals.

489
00:50:38,824 --> 00:50:40,846
Yeah, that's a great question and

490
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:59,494
One that we're sort of wrestling with a little bit, I think my sociology colleagues and political science colleagues would be the first to remind me that I'm a physical scientist, not a political expert.

491
00:51:01,735 --> 00:51:04,297
So take whatever I say with a grain of salt.

492
00:51:04,377 --> 00:51:28,156
But my understanding is that a really key piece of this is simply communication, just people talking to each other so that everybody understands that the climate piece of this is important and that all these other pieces are important as well, and try to, I think, build a sort of

493
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:46,153
larger community, visible community of support for some of these things, because these are issues that are going to be very hard to push for, I think, in terms of building renewable energy.

494
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:51,455
So, yeah, I don't have a

495
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:56,575
I'm not sure you're asking me to have a good political strategy.

496
00:51:56,635 --> 00:51:57,335
I'm not sure what that is.

497
00:51:57,455 --> 00:52:22,186
But I do think that one piece of it is if folks understand better what the issues are and if they're talking, if everybody's talking more as a community and they understand that these are big issues for everybody, I think that's how to find a base of support for some of these issues.

498
00:52:25,257 --> 00:52:25,878
Great, thanks.

499
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,862
That looks like Lois is next.

500
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:42,731
You mentioned heat pumps versus the underground heat.

501
00:52:44,212 --> 00:52:52,659
You talked about when the power will be most needed, blackouts and so forth.

502
00:52:54,527 --> 00:53:00,230
Which of those uses the most energy to run?

503
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:08,833
Is there an advantage to one kind over another in regards to blackouts?

504
00:53:11,514 --> 00:53:13,135
Yeah, that's a great question.

505
00:53:13,255 --> 00:53:18,417
And I think one that we're hoping to get a better handle on, I think

506
00:53:21,048 --> 00:53:27,093
The network geothermal, which is the ground source heat pump, that is much more efficient.

507
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:28,955
So it uses less electricity.

508
00:53:29,836 --> 00:53:31,377
So that part is good.

509
00:53:32,218 --> 00:53:41,586
The challenge with the network geothermal, the network is in the name, it works better if you're running many houses at a time.

510
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:46,490
So an individual person can say, oh, I want a heat pump.

511
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:52,134
as an affordable thing.

512
00:53:52,794 --> 00:53:59,220
Network geothermal, you can install your own geothermal heat pump, but that's really for people who are really pretty well off.

513
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,323
It only makes sense, really, if it's a network thing.

514
00:54:02,683 --> 00:54:04,665
So there's sort of that trade-off between

515
00:54:07,486 --> 00:54:19,130
what uses more electricity but is easier to do for individuals versus what uses less electricity but is much kind of more extensive to set up.

516
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:35,575
But I think what we're hoping is that, and I think what everybody who thinks about these things is hoping is that by thinking about these blackout issues now, we'll just avoid getting in a place where there really is a substantial chance of a blackout.

517
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:44,082
So I think the plan is to sort of just avoid that by thinking about it ahead of time.

518
00:54:45,443 --> 00:54:50,247
I don't know how feasible that is, but I think that's really the goal.

519
00:54:50,267 --> 00:54:51,307
Yeah.

520
00:54:53,049 --> 00:54:56,952
Thank you.

521
00:54:57,532 --> 00:54:58,673
I see Barry's hand next.

522
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:02,356
Matt, you

523
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:06,681
said that wind permitting is in limbo for now.

524
00:55:06,981 --> 00:55:27,132
Now, I know that the Feds, I know that Trump, among the 4,000 executive orders, has paused siting of wind or stopped it on federal land.

525
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:27,913
But

526
00:55:30,796 --> 00:55:37,264
But that shouldn't put it completely on pause in Massachusetts, or does it?

527
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:40,488
Yeah, thanks.

528
00:55:40,528 --> 00:55:42,611
Thanks for asking a question I don't really know the answer to.

529
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,113
Yeah, I think.

530
00:55:45,874 --> 00:55:46,675
That's a great question.

531
00:55:46,715 --> 00:56:01,871
I mean, I think the greatest potential and most of the planning was for offshore wind on federal land, but there certainly could be some on non-federal land, on state land, you know, not in the water.

532
00:56:04,092 --> 00:56:10,801
I'm not under the impression, not something I know that well, I'm not under the impression that that would be a big factor.

533
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:21,034
And I think you're also right to point out that that's one of a large number of executive orders, some of which have already been walked back.

534
00:56:22,836 --> 00:56:32,224
And ceasing the permitting for offshore wind has huge economic and job implications.

535
00:56:32,344 --> 00:56:37,148
So I think it's maybe not unreasonable to hope that that one gets walked back as well.

536
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:48,938
But yeah, so far as I know, the main opportunity for substantial wind energy was offshore, but I could be wrong about that.

537
00:56:52,703 --> 00:56:53,657
I think I see Bob next.

538
00:56:55,244 --> 00:56:59,987
Yeah, just to follow up on that, I'm familiar with offshore wind.

539
00:57:02,488 --> 00:57:09,633
And it has the highest potential for energy for insulation costs being offshore.

540
00:57:09,653 --> 00:57:18,458
And unfortunately, that falls into the purview of the Department of BOEM, I guess, Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management.

541
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:21,880
So it's unfortunately federally overseen

542
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:30,786
Also, there was an issue about seasonality of blackouts for, let's say, electrification.

543
00:57:30,986 --> 00:57:34,708
And I have a heat pump system, as well as solar on my roof.

544
00:57:34,728 --> 00:57:38,571
And I noticed, well, in the summer, I have plenty of solar.

545
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:46,736
So I basically am still getting credits in the summer, even though my heat pump is cooling my house.

546
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,499
But in winter, I have a big penalty, a big electrical penalty.

547
00:57:50,539 --> 00:57:52,040
And that's what's going to happen.

548
00:57:53,188 --> 00:57:55,650
Now, wind is most prevalent in the winter.

549
00:57:56,090 --> 00:58:01,694
So that would be, at least in the summer, because you get more storms, et cetera.

550
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:06,097
It would be nice to have wind really promoted.

551
00:58:06,557 --> 00:58:12,381
And that's going to be a key roadblock if the feds have to approve all these things.

552
00:58:13,422 --> 00:58:21,790
That's definitely a major issue is we have to have winter electricity, and that has to really come from wind.

553
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:27,875
Solar is like puny, especially when the snow covers my solar panels, which has been happening.

554
00:58:29,677 --> 00:58:36,363
Definitely, wind is a key to winter electrification, and we definitely have to pay attention to that.

555
00:58:38,325 --> 00:58:39,186
Yeah, I totally agree.

556
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:43,503
I see Josh.

557
00:58:51,286 --> 00:59:00,149
Sorry, after five years, you know, since the pandemic, you think I'd have a better handle on where the mute and video buttons are.

558
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:03,370
Something that

559
00:59:04,381 --> 00:59:16,166
I think has been challenged for me as an urban planner working for a municipality is the difference in responsibility that utilities have versus the municipalities.

560
00:59:17,747 --> 00:59:28,891
It's great that we encourage solar panels here in Medford or wind turbines, but the energy mix is much more down to the decisions of the utilities.

561
00:59:28,951 --> 00:59:30,412
And you mentioned earlier about how

562
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:51,330
gateway communities in particular have a leeriness to sort of these utility-led programs, and also, you know, short of, you know, re-legalizing new municipal light plants or, like, nationalizing or municipalizing these, like, utilities.

563
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:59,577
Like, what can we do to sort of deal with the utility dominance in the kind of decision-making space?

564
01:00:01,168 --> 01:00:05,500
Yeah, that's a great question that I wish I knew the answer to.

565
01:00:09,153 --> 01:00:29,157
From my personal perspective, which seemed to be the perspective of some of the community folks I was talking to, that the utilities need to be much more heavily regulated or sort of reopen the possibility of new players or co-ops or something like that.

566
01:00:30,517 --> 01:00:36,198
I don't know that that's particularly feasible in Massachusetts, but the sense I get

567
01:00:38,412 --> 01:00:47,255
is that there's a great deal of resistance to a lot of things that pretty desperately need to be done by the existing utilities.

568
01:00:48,435 --> 01:01:00,940
I don't have a solution, but I suspect that, at the least, a stronger regulatory framework or more bullying from the state is really going to be necessary.

569
01:01:04,181 --> 01:01:04,501
Thank you.

570
01:01:07,662 --> 01:01:07,862
Dan?

571
01:01:10,336 --> 01:01:31,081
Yeah, to add a thought to that, I know that there is a lot of interest and opportunity in building things like battery storage and offshore wind in Massachusetts and the New England area.

572
01:01:32,342 --> 01:01:37,383
And a lot of it gets shut down from the regulatory process.

573
01:01:38,464 --> 01:02:05,605
Um, not necessarily from like the utilities, but I'm interested if you have any thoughts on sort of how the kind of state, um, regulatory process might better influence, um, you know, or, or help kind of guide the process of interconnection for, um, you know, renewable sources of energy, um, that would benefit these communities.

574
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:14,073
And a lot of those are going to be kind of utility driven or necessary, you know, to have input from the utilities.

575
01:02:16,478 --> 01:02:19,859
Yeah, unfortunately, I think that's kind of the big question.

576
01:02:19,879 --> 01:02:21,820
Unfortunately, I don't have a good answer for it.

577
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:36,564
I think that the more that communities can talk amongst themselves and have a clear voice, individual communities, more communities can work together so that they have a stronger voice.

578
01:02:38,604 --> 01:02:41,585
That seems like an important piece of it.

579
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:57,111
Massachusetts is going to start backing itself into legal issues because it does have some legal commitments in terms of reducing its fossil fuel emissions that it simply will not be able to meet unless it starts to move more quickly.

580
01:02:57,131 --> 01:03:00,932
I don't know if there's a legal avenue there.

581
01:03:03,323 --> 01:03:11,510
Again, just a personal opinion, the lack of transparency on Beacon Hill, I think, is a huge factor.

582
01:03:12,571 --> 01:03:16,174
Sometimes it's hard to figure out where things get blocked.

583
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:27,643
So that may be another area where a strong community voice, coherent community voice across the state

584
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:30,946
I don't know that it's happened yet.

585
01:03:30,986 --> 01:03:32,268
I don't know the potential for it.

586
01:03:32,328 --> 01:03:44,419
But more connection at the community level between Eastern Mass and Western Mass, I think, could be more of a political force right now.

587
01:03:44,439 --> 01:03:47,922
I think the two sides of the state are kind of played off against each other.

588
01:03:47,942 --> 01:03:54,007
But yes, I think that that is a big issue, other than

589
01:03:55,751 --> 01:04:00,133
more community voice and maybe there's some legal avenues to be explored.

590
01:04:00,173 --> 01:04:03,494
I don't have really much to offer, I'm afraid.

591
01:04:03,514 --> 01:04:16,779
Yeah, I think it's difficult where you have projects that could reduce carbon output, could be beneficial to the entire region, but they face both.

592
01:04:17,299 --> 01:04:19,020
If you have a three-year interconnection queue,

593
01:04:20,772 --> 01:04:26,758
it changes your project economics, then you have local opposition to it, changes that as well.

594
01:04:27,018 --> 01:04:37,748
There's a lot on the regulatory side, I feel like here that blocks the development of beneficial projects.

595
01:04:38,169 --> 01:04:42,793
I saw someone in the chat mentioned Texas, say what you will about Texas,

596
01:04:43,929 --> 01:04:52,053
it's very, very easy to build a wind or solar or battery project in Texas, and that has quite a bit of benefits on the grid there.

597
01:04:53,294 --> 01:05:01,578
It's something that people are moving out of the New England region, trying to build these projects for exactly that reason.

598
01:05:01,759 --> 01:05:05,220
It's too hard to get anything done.

599
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:13,345
On a local level, I feel like we need to be supporting these projects in our neighborhoods,

600
01:05:15,094 --> 01:05:19,735
against, you know, pushing back against them and adding more regulatory oversight.

601
01:05:20,756 --> 01:05:20,996
Yeah.

602
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:31,379
And I know Barry has a question, but just to sort of reinforce that, I think some of that is maybe a small piece, but I think some of that is community education.

603
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:34,220
So there is kind of a reflexive

604
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:45,161
a response to not wanting things in your backyard or as well as a very reasonable response to not wanting your energy costs to go up.

605
01:05:45,201 --> 01:06:00,025
But I think if people had a better understanding of what's at stake and how it works and how it can benefit other things at the same time, there might be more community level support.

606
01:06:04,665 --> 01:06:08,468
And I think, Barry, you might have to take us out with our final question.

607
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:10,609
OK.

608
01:06:10,829 --> 01:06:12,010
I sort of had to.

609
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:30,861
But after asking Matt something that he didn't know anything about and scolded me for it, I figured I'd give him a softball that was right up his alley, which is what I think that Medford has done some pretty good mapping around.

610
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:39,594
expectations around flooding, but that it's largely based on anticipated sea level rises.

611
01:06:39,974 --> 01:06:52,377
And I wonder if you could talk at all about what unexpectable precipitation events we should expect.

612
01:06:57,023 --> 01:07:05,209
you know, after Asheville, that should make us all rather, anybody anywhere, rather nervous.

613
01:07:09,052 --> 01:07:18,599
And a second thing, if there's time, which is sort of up your alley, but not quite, is a lot of people,

614
01:07:20,093 --> 01:07:39,591
We've started calling Hydro-Quebec clean energy, which I think is horrific, because drowning Tundra and Taiga in order to generate hydropower is releasing a huge amount of carbon.

615
01:07:39,611 --> 01:07:44,535
But I don't know if, do you know how, to what degree that's been quantified?

616
01:07:44,555 --> 01:07:44,615
And

617
01:07:49,428 --> 01:07:51,549
So that's the harder of the two for you.

618
01:07:52,029 --> 01:08:12,497
Yeah, well, that's also the one that, again, I know less about, so it's easier to answer for me, which is I think hydropower is the most impactful of the renewable energies, for sure, far and away, and yet is planned to be a pretty substantial piece of our energy puzzle.

619
01:08:12,577 --> 01:08:15,978
So I don't know the full extent of the

620
01:08:16,858 --> 01:08:20,360
ecosystem impacts on it, but I'm sure that they're very extensive.

621
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:28,984
And I don't know in place, you know, existing impacts versus, you know, potential expansion.

622
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:39,108
But yeah, there's no question that hydropower is, if you will, for short, the dirtiest of the clean energies by far.

623
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:41,169
In terms of flooding,

624
01:08:44,396 --> 01:08:50,361
For Medford specifically, yeah, I think stormwater flooding is a big piece of it.

625
01:08:50,421 --> 01:09:02,751
You know, like Lemonster saw and other places have seen around New England the last couple of years where, you know, more or less, not exactly out of nowhere, but you can have these really substantial short

626
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:14,102
but really high impact flooding events, causing all sorts of storm water and sewer outflow issues.

627
01:09:14,303 --> 01:09:15,684
That's definitely a big risk.

628
01:09:16,885 --> 01:09:18,627
I think we've just been a little lucky so far.

629
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:26,555
And then the one that people are trying to wrestle with, including, I think this will come up in the state report, but trying to put some

630
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:35,006
numbers, even if they're very qualitative about the potential impact of a tropical cyclone like a hurricane.

631
01:09:35,026 --> 01:09:43,115
We do get remnants of hurricanes very regularly and causing high impact precipitation.

632
01:09:43,435 --> 01:09:44,637
What are the odds that we could

633
01:09:47,508 --> 01:09:54,053
get a really big event that comes right through Boston or Medford.

634
01:09:54,073 --> 01:09:55,475
It's certainly possible.

635
01:09:55,755 --> 01:09:59,718
I'm not aware of much quantification of that.

636
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:07,183
Thank you.

637
01:10:11,827 --> 01:10:15,570
And mindful of time, but Brenda, take us home.

638
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:17,753
Oh, you're muted.

639
01:10:17,773 --> 01:10:20,932
Oh, Brandon, you're muted.

640
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:24,728
I just wanted to mention regarding the flooding.

641
01:10:25,168 --> 01:10:30,470
That's one of the missing data points, I think, that would be really helpful if we had on a more local level.

642
01:10:31,571 --> 01:10:33,191
We have information about Heat Island.

643
01:10:33,231 --> 01:10:38,413
We have information about sea level rise and some of the flooding right along the river.

644
01:10:40,074 --> 01:10:50,838
But what we have to go out and get grants for and hire consultants to do on an individual municipality level is that very localized stormwater data.

645
01:10:52,539 --> 01:11:04,487
And so if that was something that was available to municipalities, that would be really helpful, especially for ones that don't have the resources even that Medford has.

646
01:11:06,569 --> 01:11:07,169
Yeah, for sure.

647
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:17,356
That's probably the trickiest problem, but I think it's not out of reach to figure out how to do it once and then

648
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:26,242
translate it to every city rather than every city that can afford it does it on their own, which I think is more the model now.

649
01:11:26,302 --> 01:11:28,663
So I think we could certainly do better there at least.

650
01:11:30,163 --> 01:11:33,844
And I also wanted to mention that Tufts is very interested in network geothermal.

651
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:41,506
And they're years out from actually implementing it, but we're very excited at the idea of them doing it too.

652
01:11:41,586 --> 01:11:47,608
So we want to be working with them and with National Grid as much as possible along the way.

653
01:11:48,275 --> 01:11:49,615
All right, I'll have to check in with them.

654
01:11:49,675 --> 01:11:55,636
But yeah, Tufts is obviously just a fantastic resource for Medford.

655
01:11:55,696 --> 01:11:56,556
So that would be great.

656
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:03,498
With that, we're nearing the close of our meeting.

657
01:12:03,598 --> 01:12:06,858
So I want to give a special thank you, Matthew.

658
01:12:07,498 --> 01:12:08,699
This was fantastic.

659
01:12:09,619 --> 01:12:13,780
I really appreciate you taking the time to share all this with us, answer our questions.

660
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:15,500
So yes.

661
01:12:16,656 --> 01:12:18,138
Yeah, thank you very much for having me.

662
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:18,838
I really appreciate it.

663
01:12:21,761 --> 01:12:31,531
And with that, I'm going to quickly transition us seamlessly effortlessly to our final moments here in this meeting.

664
01:12:34,172 --> 01:12:43,538
The big thing I'd like to do now is get some updates on any outside projects people are working on.

665
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:58,548
To kind of set a precedent going forward, I'd like to close all of our meetings just before new business with 5 to 10 minutes devoted to general updates, what you've been working on, where you're struggling, what you might need help with.

666
01:13:00,493 --> 01:13:14,965
So I'd like to kind of open the floor for people that are working on smaller things to share for two, maybe three minutes and talk about what they've been working on and how we as a committee can make ourselves helpful.

667
01:13:19,689 --> 01:13:21,130
If it's OK, I can go first.

668
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:23,592
Please do.

669
01:13:24,294 --> 01:13:25,674
Okay.

670
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:27,435
I've been working on two things.

671
01:13:28,235 --> 01:13:36,858
I know we wanted to bring someone from any of the Zero Waste, either Melrose or someone else, to one of our meetings.

672
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:42,240
I reached out to Zero Waste Cambridge from Public Works.

673
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,800
I spoke to Mike Orr.

674
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:46,721
I had just like a conversation.

675
01:13:48,502 --> 01:13:53,024
you know, how it all started and kind of like the lessons learned type of thing.

676
01:13:53,884 --> 01:14:02,467
He did, he was not so keen on coming to a meeting this late in the evening.

677
01:14:02,687 --> 01:14:11,170
So as an alternative, at some point, he said, if there are any questions from any of the members, we can pass that along.

678
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:14,331
And based on that, he could potentially come.

679
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:16,632
I'm happy to reach out to other towns as well.

680
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:20,701
based on any feedback you all might have.

681
01:14:20,721 --> 01:14:35,727
Then the second item is, I floated this idea around to Brenda and Will about an Earth Day or like an Earth Month.

682
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:47,392
Celebration in Medford, without taking too much time, I'm going to quickly share my screen.

683
01:14:47,452 --> 01:14:54,815
I just have three quick slides, and then hopefully we can just get some interest, whoever is interested.

684
01:14:54,895 --> 01:15:03,219
And then Will is already super interested and super adopter.

685
01:15:03,339 --> 01:15:05,580
If someone else too, then we can all just directly

686
01:15:07,677 --> 01:15:09,138
have a conversation separately.

687
01:15:09,878 --> 01:15:14,481
So without trying to waste any time, I'm going to share my screen.

688
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:21,745
There's so many millions of other tabs.

689
01:15:21,765 --> 01:15:26,327
I hope you can see this Canva screen that's right here.

690
01:15:26,767 --> 01:15:30,389
I think we're seeing your whole desktop, not just the screen.

691
01:15:30,689 --> 01:15:31,190
OK.

692
01:15:39,271 --> 01:15:42,711
Is it just a... Much better.

693
01:15:43,353 --> 01:15:44,013
OK, great.

694
01:15:44,614 --> 01:15:44,894
Awesome.

695
01:15:45,394 --> 01:15:48,076
So this is just an idea.

696
01:15:48,096 --> 01:15:50,217
Again, think about it, everyone.

697
01:15:50,317 --> 01:15:51,697
And we would love feedback.

698
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,919
Earth Day is on April 22.

699
01:15:54,339 --> 01:15:59,241
So it'd be amazing if we can have a Medford Earth Day celebration.

700
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:11,528
And a couple of ideas that, like I said, we briefly discussed and obviously open to any changes and feedback is that we celebrate an Earth Month.

701
01:16:12,468 --> 01:16:25,421
in April with like a social media campaign, either posting daily on our Facebook group and or like a website update if possible.

702
01:16:25,441 --> 01:16:34,949
Again, we'll have to think about the approvals, logistics, etc., but really just like getting residents engagement.

703
01:16:34,989 --> 01:16:37,312
And this is definitely one of the things that the

704
01:16:37,932 --> 01:16:46,997
that Mike Orr also highlighted when they started Zero Waste Cambridge is getting the residents and everyone very much engaged.

705
01:16:48,029 --> 01:16:57,134
in what we are trying to do, really just like highlighting, you know, either businesses, sustainable businesses, or household zero waste tips.

706
01:16:57,274 --> 01:17:00,955
I have like a little flyer on the next slide.

707
01:17:01,676 --> 01:17:15,803
And then the other one is have a big zero waste event, the weekend, we could decide on dates, potentially, the weekend after April 22, which is also kind of the last weekend in April.

708
01:17:18,546 --> 01:17:27,468
And, you know, like the social media useful tip of the day, every day could be even something like this.

709
01:17:27,508 --> 01:17:28,849
I just wrote up something.

710
01:17:28,929 --> 01:17:32,129
So obviously, it's not super crafted.

711
01:17:32,509 --> 01:17:34,850
But the idea is we have time.

712
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:43,372
So if some of us can just team up, we can keep all of these ready, approvals,

713
01:17:44,752 --> 01:17:46,613
editing, everything can be taken care of.

714
01:17:46,653 --> 01:17:52,177
We have a couple of months and two meetings, as Will pointed out, to iron the details.

715
01:17:53,978 --> 01:18:00,022
And then finally, some thoughts that we were thinking about for the big Zero Waste event.

716
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:06,586
Like a reuse rodeo, Will gave a nice web link to this.

717
01:18:06,666 --> 01:18:10,108
I think it's on the mass.gov website too.

718
01:18:10,568 --> 01:18:12,430
So basically, it's like a flea market.

719
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:15,171
except that everything is free.

720
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:21,294
I know some of us are like part of the everything is free Medford EIFM community as well.

721
01:18:21,354 --> 01:18:22,434
So that's online.

722
01:18:22,855 --> 01:18:40,403
This is basically an offline or an in-person event where you can donate items, people can exchange, really just to promote reusing and highlighting that it really keeps things away from the landfill.

723
01:18:42,093 --> 01:18:49,354
And we could also use that event to, again, spotlight some of the sustainable businesses in and around Medford.

724
01:18:49,594 --> 01:19:00,696
So we do have a few logistical items to figure out, like location, contacting the business, really doing the newsletter, social media campaign, and other stuff.

725
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:07,898
So we would love any volunteers to work on this and we can

726
01:19:09,058 --> 01:19:15,872
I think it'd be a great opportunity for us to engage the community on our zero waste or low waste efforts.

727
01:19:17,656 --> 01:19:20,441
I've stopped sharing and would love to hear thoughts.

728
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,064
Looking just mostly at the clock more than anything.

729
01:19:28,785 --> 01:19:32,390
I'd like to remind folks, we have all of our individual emails.

730
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:40,222
So, if you want to reach out to independently with thoughts, concerns, questions, whatever, please do that.

731
01:19:41,008 --> 01:19:45,632
And I also want to remind everyone that my email is up there, so you should reach out to me as well.

732
01:19:45,812 --> 01:19:57,742
If you want something publicized to the whole MEC group, if you have an idea, a thought, a concern, a haiku, maybe not a haiku, but whatever I can publicize to the group, I will do that as well.

733
01:19:59,023 --> 01:20:04,248
But I love these ideas, and I want to, well, keep talking about these, I'm sure.

734
01:20:04,268 --> 01:20:06,510
Awesome.

735
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:06,870
Thanks, Phil.

736
01:20:11,704 --> 01:20:12,064
Loretta.

737
01:20:12,084 --> 01:20:14,708
Hi, I liked the idea.

738
01:20:14,728 --> 01:20:18,112
I just wanted to add that's a really busy week and Arabiday is that Friday.

739
01:20:18,132 --> 01:20:20,214
And usually the city has events.

740
01:20:20,735 --> 01:20:25,781
So it's always like a lot going on with Earth Week and Arabiday.

741
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:26,141
So if.

742
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,824
we decide to help with this project.

743
01:20:29,844 --> 01:20:37,906
You know, we need some volunteers instead of up my alley for coordinating events in the past.

744
01:20:38,546 --> 01:20:44,207
I'm sure that Therese Medford and the city would help with that too, but they usually keep it separate.

745
01:20:44,227 --> 01:20:51,509
So we've never had an actual Earth Day celebration that I'm aware of, but I just wanted to share that with you that that's Friday.

746
01:20:51,529 --> 01:20:53,830
I'm not sure what day the city's celebrating it.

747
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:54,790
It could be that day.

748
01:20:57,466 --> 01:21:05,469
There's also, there's usually a community cleanup that weekend at some point as well, I think sort of around the theme of Earth Day.

749
01:21:05,489 --> 01:21:07,150
Right, right.

750
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:09,571
So we probably want to do a different day then.

751
01:21:11,252 --> 01:21:12,912
I don't know if that's been scheduled yet, though.

752
01:21:12,932 --> 01:21:14,293
I haven't seen it on the calendar.

753
01:21:17,114 --> 01:21:19,095
I really like the zero waste one.

754
01:21:21,075 --> 01:21:26,218
That's a great idea to put on something like that.

755
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:27,158
It would be.

756
01:21:27,662 --> 01:21:27,922
Yeah.

757
01:21:33,544 --> 01:21:38,266
Right, I can give, we have three full minutes.

758
01:21:38,846 --> 01:21:42,667
I know Lois and Benji were also working on some projects.

759
01:21:42,907 --> 01:21:49,609
If anyone else would like to share briefly, we'll try to find more time in the future to keep this going.

760
01:21:59,767 --> 01:22:01,008
Any closing updates?

761
01:22:01,028 --> 01:22:08,811
All right.

762
01:22:10,172 --> 01:22:20,297
And then final moments for any new business, anything on people's minds, things that people think need to be brought to our attention.

763
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:29,954
Right.

764
01:22:31,975 --> 01:22:34,596
It's exactly 758 Monday night.

765
01:22:35,636 --> 01:22:36,016
I get it.

766
01:22:36,336 --> 01:22:36,737
I'm there.

767
01:22:39,117 --> 01:22:40,938
I'd entertain any further motions.

768
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:44,499
Motion to adjourn.

769
01:22:49,001 --> 01:22:50,361
Looks like Louis is seconding it.

770
01:22:50,381 --> 01:22:52,122
I will take that.

771
01:22:52,742 --> 01:22:53,482
It has to count.

772
01:22:54,263 --> 01:22:54,983
Thank you so much.
