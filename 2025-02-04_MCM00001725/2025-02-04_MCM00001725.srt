1
00:00:00,171 --> 00:00:03,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I just want to jump right into a lot of good stuff tonight.

2
00:00:04,053 --> 00:00:06,094
[SPEAKER_10]: So, let's go down the line.

3
00:00:07,834 --> 00:00:08,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Josh?

4
00:00:09,335 --> 00:00:09,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

5
00:00:11,336 --> 00:00:11,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Lois?

6
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:18,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I see you.

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:20,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Present.

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Muted.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,540
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll work on that part.

10
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:23,761
[SPEAKER_10]: Benji?

11
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:24,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Here.

12
00:00:25,862 --> 00:00:26,302
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

13
00:00:27,862 --> 00:00:28,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Loretta?

14
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:28,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Here.

15
00:00:30,507 --> 00:00:30,947
[SPEAKER_10]: Kathleen.

16
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,592
[SPEAKER_10]: I see you there.

17
00:00:36,612 --> 00:00:38,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Luke.

18
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:42,497
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not seeing Luke.

19
00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:45,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Just signed in perfect timing.

20
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:59,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Dan Bob Jessica.

21
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:02,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Not seeing Jessica.

22
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,320
[SPEAKER_10]: John also not seeing.

23
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Will is here and Paul.

24
00:01:12,543 --> 00:01:17,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Not here, but 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 is perfect.

25
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:25,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Did everyone have a chance to look over the minutes from last month?

26
00:01:26,598 --> 00:01:27,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I never received it.

27
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:30,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm in the same boat as Preetha.

28
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,423
[SPEAKER_10]: That's so helpful because it means that neither of you are on our MEC major mailer.

30
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:41,884
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll make sure that I add you right now.

31
00:01:41,904 --> 00:01:42,905
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

32
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:44,805
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.

33
00:01:44,825 --> 00:01:47,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on the Teams thing.

34
00:01:47,326 --> 00:01:50,868
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you sent the Teams one, Brenda.

35
00:01:51,588 --> 00:01:53,769
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's what it should have gone to.

36
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:58,754
[SPEAKER_09]: I received some meek emails directly, but I haven't seen the minutes.

37
00:01:59,234 --> 00:02:02,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they were included with the agenda that Will put out for this meeting.

38
00:02:03,035 --> 00:02:04,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I usually put them out with the agenda.

39
00:02:05,996 --> 00:02:10,237
[SPEAKER_10]: The really scary part, it's always in the spam.

40
00:02:10,317 --> 00:02:12,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, is it in the OU water?

41
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:14,438
[SPEAKER_10]: It always finds a way into spam.

42
00:02:15,038 --> 00:02:18,939
[SPEAKER_10]: It happened to me for the first six months I've been here.

43
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:21,080
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been fishing through spam trying to find it.

44
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,751
[SPEAKER_10]: Every once in a while, it'll still happen, but double check.

45
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:28,653
[SPEAKER_11]: I never received the final agenda, and it did not go to spam.

46
00:02:28,673 --> 00:02:30,254
[SPEAKER_11]: I received the draft.

47
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:31,234
Oh.

48
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:34,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there were no changes from the draft.

49
00:02:34,156 --> 00:02:38,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I did not receive any notes to the agenda.

50
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,360
[SPEAKER_11]: So the draft was the final.

51
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:40,840
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

52
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

53
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:50,186
[SPEAKER_10]: So acknowledging that some of us didn't receive it,

54
00:02:51,032 --> 00:02:58,618
[SPEAKER_10]: We can still potentially move it to a vote with some abstain ease, but we will be cognizant of that.

55
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:00,399
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it is in the spam, found it.

56
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

57
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:04,102
[SPEAKER_10]: That's good and bad, but mostly good.

58
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:06,043
[SPEAKER_10]: It means that things are working.

59
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:06,944
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

60
00:03:11,768 --> 00:03:15,130
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would entertain a motion to accept those.

61
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:17,352
[SPEAKER_10]: So moved.

62
00:03:22,559 --> 00:03:22,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:23,860
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

64
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:25,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Bob.

65
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:27,443
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just run down the line here.

66
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:30,505
[SPEAKER_10]: If you didn't get a chance to read it, no worries.

67
00:03:30,685 --> 00:03:32,287
[SPEAKER_10]: We have abstained just for that reason.

68
00:03:33,027 --> 00:03:33,968
[SPEAKER_10]: And we'll get to next month.

69
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:36,310
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, I'm going to run down the line.

70
00:03:37,371 --> 00:03:37,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Josh?

71
00:03:38,712 --> 00:03:39,092
[SPEAKER_10]: Abstain.

72
00:03:39,112 --> 00:03:41,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

73
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:41,974
[SPEAKER_10]: Lois?

74
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:43,175
[SPEAKER_10]: Accept.

75
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:45,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Benji?

76
00:03:46,077 --> 00:03:46,758
[SPEAKER_10]: Accept.

77
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:48,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Barry?

78
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

79
00:03:51,702 --> 00:03:51,982
[SPEAKER_10]: Loretta?

80
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:53,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Abstain.

81
00:03:55,664 --> 00:03:56,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Kathleen.

82
00:04:00,146 --> 00:04:01,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I got a thumbs up.

83
00:04:01,946 --> 00:04:02,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll count it.

84
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:05,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Rebita.

85
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:06,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Abstain.

86
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:09,309
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan.

87
00:04:10,409 --> 00:04:10,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Accept.

88
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:14,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Still no Jessica.

89
00:04:15,411 --> 00:04:15,731
[SPEAKER_10]: John.

90
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:16,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Will.

91
00:04:16,432 --> 00:04:16,832
[SPEAKER_10]: I accept.

92
00:04:18,214 --> 00:04:19,555
[SPEAKER_10]: And no Paul either.

93
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:24,116
[SPEAKER_10]: So the yeas have it, six to three, abstain, yeas.

94
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:26,897
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's get started then.

95
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:27,918
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Bob Payne.

96
00:04:27,938 --> 00:04:29,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you called me, but I'll accept the two.

97
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my goodness.

98
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:38,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I also, by the way, Will, I sent you some notes about having updates on the committee member bios.

99
00:04:41,242 --> 00:04:47,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that was my first of two little administrative updates I wanted to open with.

100
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:57,415
[SPEAKER_10]: Bob helpfully pointed out that we got two new members and some members no longer with us, and we need to make sure our bios are up to date.

101
00:04:58,075 --> 00:05:04,800
[SPEAKER_10]: I know my bio was written a little over a year ago and could not be further from the truth of what I do now.

102
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:09,864
[SPEAKER_10]: Would be really helpful reminder for everyone, send in some updates.

103
00:05:11,952 --> 00:05:16,014
[SPEAKER_10]: Brenda, where's a good place we can send that before we just flood your inbox.

104
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:18,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, feel free to just flood my inbox.

105
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:19,415
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

106
00:05:19,756 --> 00:05:21,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

107
00:05:22,417 --> 00:05:23,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but let me see.

108
00:05:23,277 --> 00:05:30,681
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a. You can check out what we currently have for your bio on our.

109
00:05:31,701 --> 00:05:37,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Home page for this committee and I will just drop that link into the chat.

110
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,300
[SPEAKER_03]: But plus, the agenda used to have it.

111
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,681
[SPEAKER_03]: The minutes have it, I believe.

112
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:43,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something has it.

113
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So actually, it's interesting.

114
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,642
[SPEAKER_02]: The agenda that's actually posted doesn't have the bios.

115
00:05:50,302 --> 00:05:53,983
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not sure what the purpose is of them in the agenda.

116
00:05:56,203 --> 00:06:00,024
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, really, the bios are just on that home page on the website.

117
00:06:00,044 --> 00:06:04,525
[SPEAKER_10]: There he is.

118
00:06:05,225 --> 00:06:05,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Wow.

119
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:11,829
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll get that sorted, so please update your bios if you need to.

120
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:14,650
[SPEAKER_10]: If not, you know, keep doing what you're doing.

121
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:24,132
[SPEAKER_10]: The other piece of administrative work was I would love to get a hybrid meeting for our next session.

122
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:27,672
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that is March 3rd.

123
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:35,563
[SPEAKER_10]: I would love to see some of you in person.

124
00:06:35,943 --> 00:06:39,985
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's really nice and makes for more meaningful conversation.

125
00:06:40,425 --> 00:06:45,748
[SPEAKER_10]: But as always, we'll leave that Zoom window open so that we can have those hybrid guests as well.

126
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:50,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Just something I wanted to put on your radar.

127
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:54,432
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you have really strong feelings against it, please let me know.

128
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:59,815
[SPEAKER_10]: But otherwise, I would love to move for a hybrid meeting next month, March 3rd.

129
00:07:04,828 --> 00:07:08,091
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, those are my 2 little tidbits of housekeeping.

130
00:07:09,572 --> 00:07:12,174
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd love to throw it over to Brenda.

131
00:07:12,194 --> 00:07:17,599
[SPEAKER_10]: To talk about our municipal updates are electrifying Medford all that good stuff.

132
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:20,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

133
00:07:21,776 --> 00:07:23,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, let's start with Electrify Medford.

134
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:27,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, we have 113 people who've signed up for it.

135
00:07:27,178 --> 00:07:29,059
[SPEAKER_02]: 42 have been coached.

136
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:36,683
[SPEAKER_02]: We did an info session at the library on the 16th of January.

137
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,864
[SPEAKER_02]: And that went really well.

138
00:07:38,884 --> 00:07:41,565
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a little presentation, and then we split up into

139
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:49,828
[SPEAKER_02]: to little one-on-one coaching sessions around the room with people so we could do their coaching sessions right then.

140
00:07:49,848 --> 00:07:51,949
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seemed to work really well.

141
00:07:51,969 --> 00:07:54,350
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do more of those moving forward.

142
00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:06,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I already have one set up at the senior center at the beginning of March, and I'm working on scheduling one at the West Medford Community Center as well.

143
00:08:08,077 --> 00:08:17,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also looking for other locations around the city, places like that, where people are gathering, that would be good locations for something like that.

144
00:08:18,086 --> 00:08:20,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have any suggestions, please let me know.

145
00:08:22,029 --> 00:08:24,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Places that we should be doing these info sessions.

146
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:41,263
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also planning to have some door hangers that we're going to be putting out in March and working with a marketing professor at Northeastern actually who lives in Medford.

147
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,765
[SPEAKER_02]: who's helping to prepare the message for it.

148
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:49,126
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do some A-B testing to see the best messaging for them.

149
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:58,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're actually going to have some Northeastern students who are going to be going door to door, not knocking on people's doors, but just putting the door hangers up.

150
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:05,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So that should be a good influx of people signing up in March.

151
00:09:07,028 --> 00:09:14,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then for the mass save community 1st partnership, part of this, um, that training was rescheduled for April 4th.

152
00:09:15,415 --> 00:09:19,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, just because their 3 year plan hasn't been approved yet.

153
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:20,919
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be approved at the end of this month.

154
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so.

155
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:29,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to that just to get some updates directly from the horse's mouth.

156
00:09:33,577 --> 00:09:38,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see in the chat, someone saying the energy group photo on the website is extremely old.

157
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:39,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

158
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could use a replacement photo.

159
00:09:43,845 --> 00:09:44,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

160
00:09:45,406 --> 00:09:50,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it would be great to schedule a time when everyone is going to be together so that we could do that.

161
00:09:58,441 --> 00:10:05,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see what else oh, the Andrews and McGlynn HVAC project is moving along.

162
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:12,850
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to be getting proposals from construction managers this week.

163
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:23,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll be working, then we'll be meeting with our selection committee to choose 1 and then onboarding them so that we can preorder the equipment that has some really long lead time.

164
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can get that installed this summer.

165
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:33,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, it doesn't look like it's going to be ordered before tariffs hit, but we tried.

166
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:39,018
[SPEAKER_03]: The tariffs are off for a month.

167
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:40,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, are they?

168
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:40,739
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

169
00:10:46,582 --> 00:10:52,145
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, well, maybe we can get through all of that in a month and get the equipment pre-ordered.

170
00:10:52,665 --> 00:10:59,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like it will probably be mid-March before we actually get the pre-order in for them, but we'll see.

171
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:11,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we are planning to do a plug load audit at the library because the electricity use has been a lot higher than we anticipated.

172
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:21,727
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't actually been a net 0. so we did some work with the building automation system, changing some schedules.

173
00:11:23,768 --> 00:11:28,054
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're still seeing increased energy usage compared to what we expected.

174
00:11:28,175 --> 00:11:31,079
[SPEAKER_02]: So we think that might be a plug load issue.

175
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:33,002
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do a plug load audit for that.

176
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:41,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and oh, I wanted to highlight for this group that the.

177
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:49,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Community development board and the city council are looking as part of the zoning overhaul that's happening.

178
00:11:50,197 --> 00:11:52,538
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking at implementing a green score.

179
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,099
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really focusing on, um.

180
00:11:58,567 --> 00:12:03,829
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really sort of a stormwater issue, but in a more of a natural way.

181
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:11,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, let me share my screen here so you can take a look at what this looks like.

182
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:21,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you see the...

183
00:12:25,848 --> 00:12:26,788
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

184
00:12:26,828 --> 00:12:28,089
[SPEAKER_02]: See the Excel spreadsheet?

185
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:30,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

186
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:47,014
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea of the green score is to have a flexible way for larger buildings and buildings in flood zones to have more permeable surface on their property.

187
00:12:49,925 --> 00:13:02,566
[SPEAKER_02]: And the way of doing that is there's going to be a particular score that they have to meet, and then there are different ways they can do it, different types of plants, green roofs.

188
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:17,089
[SPEAKER_02]: Vegetated walls, permeable paving, and based on the combination of items that they have on their property, then it would add up to the score that they have to meet.

189
00:13:17,749 --> 00:13:26,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is for areas that are in FEMA flood zones and buildings that have to go through site plan review.

190
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:35,090
[SPEAKER_02]: So, those are buildings over 10,000 square feet or 6 units and there are some other requirements as well.

191
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,972
[SPEAKER_02]: There are things like parking lots and gas stations and things like that that would also have to go through it.

192
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:47,716
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is something that's being discussed at this Wednesday's community development board meeting.

193
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:52,799
[SPEAKER_02]: And then after that, it would go back to to city council.

194
00:13:55,613 --> 00:13:56,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Frederick, I have a question.

195
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:58,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, just a second.

196
00:13:58,514 --> 00:14:00,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Barry, I saw you raised your hand there.

197
00:14:00,134 --> 00:14:00,755
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

198
00:14:00,935 --> 00:14:10,657
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm wondering how the green roof is compatible with the solar roof ordinance.

199
00:14:11,998 --> 00:14:18,240
[SPEAKER_11]: And I also thought that there was going to be some additional solar roof

200
00:14:22,323 --> 00:14:29,307
[SPEAKER_11]: stipulations that would get additional points.

201
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:30,948
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't see that on here.

202
00:14:31,469 --> 00:14:34,911
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm a bit puzzled about both of those things.

203
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:37,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Not for this.

204
00:14:37,313 --> 00:14:40,615
[SPEAKER_02]: The green roof is really focused on stormwater.

205
00:14:40,635 --> 00:14:43,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, the green score is really focused on stormwater.

206
00:14:45,478 --> 00:14:47,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Green roofs and solar are

207
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:58,681
[SPEAKER_02]: quite compatible in that the green roof lowers the temperature and actually makes the solar more efficient.

208
00:14:59,182 --> 00:15:04,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, there could be potentially a weight issue with having both of those things on the roof.

209
00:15:04,366 --> 00:15:07,409
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's something that would have to be considered while it's being designed.

210
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:12,153
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, yeah, they're definitely compatible.

211
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:19,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Loretta, what were you saying?

212
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:32,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I was curious about, this is for large-scale projects, what about, could it be considered for smaller, like for three families, any development in the city?

213
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:38,213
[SPEAKER_02]: It was discussed for small-scale projects, but the thought was that it was too,

214
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,632
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated for smaller building owners to do.

215
00:15:46,652 --> 00:15:58,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really, it was sort of a balancing act between the complexity of it and covering as much as we could.

216
00:15:58,636 --> 00:16:01,117
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting.

217
00:16:02,417 --> 00:16:02,697
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

218
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:05,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

219
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:08,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Will, did you have a comment?

220
00:16:08,854 --> 00:16:10,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I had two quick ones.

221
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:17,817
[SPEAKER_10]: One is, uh, if you were at Liberty to send this to us, uh, cause if they're hearing this on Wednesday, I'd love to.

222
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:25,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Read about it and maybe potentially speak for or against it, depending on how weird, how we're feeling.

223
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:26,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.

224
00:16:27,301 --> 00:16:32,383
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is in the public, um, folder for, I can drop the link in the chat.

225
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:38,025
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the public folder for the, uh, community development board meeting materials.

226
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:43,695
[SPEAKER_10]: Fantastic, thank you.

227
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:49,377
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, that mostly clears up what I'm looking for.

228
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:50,578
[SPEAKER_10]: So actually, I'm almost set.

229
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:50,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

230
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:51,638
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

231
00:16:54,559 --> 00:17:02,402
[SPEAKER_02]: And I see Josh also uses a green score during development review, and he linked to Somerville's green score.

232
00:17:03,182 --> 00:17:05,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we copy Somerville a lot.

233
00:17:07,048 --> 00:17:11,450
[SPEAKER_09]: It works really well and is good for our green roofs work.

234
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:16,352
[SPEAKER_09]: So hopefully, that's a reassuring case study.

235
00:17:19,474 --> 00:17:19,834
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.

236
00:17:19,854 --> 00:17:19,974
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

237
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:24,236
[SPEAKER_02]: And we looked at the green scores that other municipalities had as we were putting this together.

238
00:17:24,656 --> 00:17:31,699
[SPEAKER_02]: And we worked with the same zoning consultant who's doing the rest of the zoning overhaul for this as well.

239
00:17:34,282 --> 00:17:37,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a requirement for the score level?

240
00:17:38,604 --> 00:17:42,206
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they don't meet it, do they have to pay any fees?

241
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:49,329
[SPEAKER_06]: And is this something volunteered by the design people?

242
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:52,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Or how does that work?

243
00:17:53,852 --> 00:17:57,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is something that they would put together and submit to us.

244
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:03,056
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our department would be reviewing it.

245
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:07,097
[SPEAKER_06]: So there must be some minimal threshold.

246
00:18:07,177 --> 00:18:08,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there is.

247
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:16,780
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really have any meaning, I think, but there's, let me see here.

248
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have any meaning just in terms of basic numbers here, but I can share that portion of the.

249
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:27,048
[SPEAKER_02]: of that as well here.

250
00:18:27,068 --> 00:18:31,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can click through and you can see this yourself.

251
00:18:31,874 --> 00:18:41,926
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, there's a minimum green score and then there's an ideal of what we're looking for and we're hoping to push developers to.

252
00:18:51,634 --> 00:18:55,377
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you remind me 1 more time, which is on Wednesday, which meeting will this be.

253
00:18:56,118 --> 00:18:58,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Discuss that it's the community development board.

254
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:16,311
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been getting a lot of attention lately because the zoning of the Salem Street corridor has been controversial.

255
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:25,154
[SPEAKER_02]: This was actually supposed to be discussed at their last meeting, but it got continued because the Salem Street conversation went on for so long.

256
00:19:39,128 --> 00:19:40,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see what else here.

257
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:43,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, oh, we're updating our hazard mitigation plan.

258
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:47,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is something that's supposed to be updated every 5 years.

259
00:19:47,256 --> 00:19:48,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And our last update was 2017.

260
00:19:48,337 --> 00:19:48,577
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

261
00:19:48,617 --> 00:19:55,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely something to to get on, um, you know, if we'll still have a FEMA.

262
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:10,983
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had our first public meeting for that last week, and then there are going to be focus groups and surveys to come to gain feedback from the public.

263
00:20:11,403 --> 00:20:15,188
[SPEAKER_02]: We're especially looking for people to give feedback on what

264
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:32,256
[SPEAKER_02]: if there are areas where they're seeing issues right now, especially with stormwater flooding, any other sort of hazards that they're seeing, if there are, I don't know, if there are power issues in particular areas or something like that.

265
00:20:33,656 --> 00:20:34,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Things for people to think about.

266
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:41,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also what they would be looking for from the city in terms of

267
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:53,669
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what would be useful to them for the, for the city to be doing that's really going to be a lot of the focus of the, the public meetings and the focus groups and surveys.

268
00:20:54,270 --> 00:21:04,519
[SPEAKER_02]: So, then the 2nd, public meeting is going to be in June and then the consultant will have done had time to put together something to present about what's going to be.

269
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:12,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of included like a first draft of the of the plan that that people can take a look at they're going to be maps that people can really focus in on.

270
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:18,853
[SPEAKER_02]: And then getting feedback from that they'll have a final public meeting in in September.

271
00:21:20,374 --> 00:21:22,156
[SPEAKER_02]: showing the the finished product.

272
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:29,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see what else here.

273
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:32,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we have a couple of events coming up.

274
00:21:33,953 --> 00:21:36,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, well, this year, later this year.

275
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:43,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so the rain, our, we, our annual rain barrel pickup is scheduled for May 14th.

276
00:21:46,043 --> 00:21:50,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and that happens at the high school, um, in the evening.

277
00:21:53,487 --> 00:22:04,136
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'll be sending out information to people before that so that people can order their rain barrels and then they can just come pick them up that day.

278
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:09,181
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we have a date for the Harvest Your Energy Festival.

279
00:22:09,201 --> 00:22:15,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Rain barrel thing would be advertised, right, in the monthly newsletter.

280
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:15,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

281
00:22:16,007 --> 00:22:16,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it will be.

282
00:22:16,748 --> 00:22:17,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I need one.

283
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:19,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, yeah.

284
00:22:23,036 --> 00:22:26,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're always looking for volunteers for the rain barrel pickup.

285
00:22:26,598 --> 00:22:33,584
[SPEAKER_02]: We tend to have a lot of people showing up that day and we have a long line of cars that we're trying to move through quickly.

286
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:37,827
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's always helpful to have people from the Energy Committee helping out there too.

287
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,893
[SPEAKER_02]: But Harvest Your Energy Festival, October 18th is the date for that.

288
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:51,458
[SPEAKER_02]: As expected, it's the weekend after, it's a Saturday after Indigenous Peoples Day.

289
00:23:00,424 --> 00:23:09,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think the last thing that I wanted to mention is that we're planning to apply for a mass clean energy center on street.

290
00:23:09,753 --> 00:23:16,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Charging grant, so this would be similar to the EV chargers.

291
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,123
[SPEAKER_02]: In are in the city parking lots right now, except we would be choosing locations.

292
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:34,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, on the on the with street parking where we would have those, and this is a grant where 100% of the cost is covered by mass clean energy center, including maintenance for the, for the 1st, few years.

293
00:23:36,277 --> 00:23:41,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's for, I think they said around 3 charging sites per municipality.

294
00:23:46,616 --> 00:23:53,161
[SPEAKER_02]: And Josh, I want to chat with you about that in a little more detail, actually, because I think Somerville is planning to apply for that as well, right?

295
00:23:53,281 --> 00:23:56,163
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, I submitted it the other week.

296
00:23:56,763 --> 00:23:57,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, great.

297
00:23:57,504 --> 00:24:00,626
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, do you have do you have sites that you've worked on?

298
00:24:01,046 --> 00:24:02,527
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have sites selected yet.

299
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:02,767
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

300
00:24:03,348 --> 00:24:12,454
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, well, yeah, happy to talk about it offline or, you know, we could also consider submitting for the like planning side of it, not the like

301
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:22,382
[SPEAKER_09]: Not that that necessarily adds more sites and more charging infrastructure, but getting a site strategy sets us up for some pretty solid success.

302
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:24,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.

303
00:24:24,768 --> 00:24:44,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other thing that we are still a little bit up in the air at the moment is whether we're looking to do the expedited pathway, which has a particular set of chargers that they use, which are the flow chargers, or do a custom option with charge point chargers, because that's what we have already.

304
00:24:47,835 --> 00:24:54,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I think some initial feedback I've gotten internally is just the expedited pathway in order to just speed up the process.

305
00:24:55,464 --> 00:25:01,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I would love to keep everything on one system to make it easier for me to maintain it.

306
00:25:05,102 --> 00:25:07,144
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, Josh, let's, let's connect about this.

307
00:25:08,725 --> 00:25:22,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so hopefully we got reassurances that the difference between expedited and custom, but where you just switch manufacturers was not going to be a major slow, uh, slow down, uh, during that, like info session that you and I were on a couple of weeks ago.

308
00:25:25,258 --> 00:25:25,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

309
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:25,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

310
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:31,243
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't, I wasn't clear that it was going to be quite the, yeah, quite the same, but yeah.

311
00:25:35,386 --> 00:25:39,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it for my updates.

312
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:44,398
[SPEAKER_02]: Any questions, comments on any of that?

313
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:45,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I ran through that quickly.

314
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:56,624
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought it was great, filled out my calendar really nicely.

315
00:25:57,785 --> 00:26:08,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will send out some reminders, hopefully the month before each one, to round up some volunteers, maybe a little sooner for Harvester Energy.

316
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:09,827
[SPEAKER_10]: That's usually a bit of a lift.

317
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:13,207
[SPEAKER_10]: But good things to have on our radar, ready to go.

318
00:26:15,788 --> 00:26:23,109
[SPEAKER_10]: And with that, I'm actually going to turn it over to Barry for a quick introduction of our speaker.

319
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:25,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

320
00:26:26,327 --> 00:26:31,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, everybody knows that yesterday was February 2nd, Groundhog's Day.

321
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:54,282
[SPEAKER_11]: And in honor of Groundhog's Day, I am delighted to introduce my friend, hiking partner, and neighbor, Matt Barlow, who, in addition to being a damn good naturalist and an all-around good guy, is also a climate scientist of some renown.

322
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:58,176
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's see, reading my notes here.

323
00:26:58,196 --> 00:27:09,400
[SPEAKER_11]: A meteorologist, an expert on drought, precipitation, and water cycles, but not necessarily about whether winter will end in six weeks or not.

324
00:27:11,001 --> 00:27:12,982
[SPEAKER_11]: Matt teaches at UMass Lowell.

325
00:27:13,202 --> 00:27:24,286
[SPEAKER_11]: He was a lead author for the chapter on water cycle changes for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's sixth assessment report in 2022.

326
00:27:26,783 --> 00:27:34,508
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's also the extreme precipitation team leader for the 2022 Greater Boston Climate Assessment.

327
00:27:35,568 --> 00:27:37,830
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is Matt's second visit to our group.

328
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:41,592
[SPEAKER_11]: And Matt, if I got anything wrong there, correct me.

329
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:43,727
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that was great.

330
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much for that kind introduction.

331
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:49,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks very much for having me, folks.

332
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:55,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So as some of you may know, I'm a Medford resident, but I work in Lowell.

333
00:27:55,433 --> 00:28:01,316
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope you'll forgive me some divided loyalties a little bit in what I talk about today.

334
00:28:02,816 --> 00:28:10,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did just see on the TV that two out of two groundhogs agree that their shadow has been seen.

335
00:28:11,121 --> 00:28:19,066
[SPEAKER_05]: So going by the groundhog forecast, there's what, six more weeks of winter?

336
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:27,150
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some hints in the stratosphere that we may not be done with winter as well, but that would be a whole other

337
00:28:29,368 --> 00:28:30,129
[SPEAKER_05]: presentation.

338
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:33,690
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to see if I can share my screen.

339
00:28:52,509 --> 00:28:55,471
[SPEAKER_05]: have I managed to successfully share my screen?

340
00:28:55,992 --> 00:28:56,912
[SPEAKER_10]: You are golden.

341
00:28:56,952 --> 00:28:57,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

342
00:28:57,853 --> 00:29:05,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like to keep like 50 things open on my home page or my desktop, so I have no idea actually what I'm sharing.

343
00:29:08,641 --> 00:29:19,068
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm hoping to keep this a little short so we can have some time for discussion because I'm very much interested in what you guys are thinking about as well.

344
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:27,974
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to talk just briefly about climate and energy issues at the city and neighborhood level in Massachusetts.

345
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,341
[SPEAKER_05]: which is something that we've been thinking about.

346
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:45,903
[SPEAKER_05]: So the two things that I wanted to cover tonight is we have a new Department of Energy funded Climate Resilience Center in Lowell, specifically to look at energy and climate change.

347
00:29:46,423 --> 00:29:53,585
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think a lot of the issues there parallel, you know, issues in most areas of the country.

348
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:57,267
[SPEAKER_05]: cities and towns in Massachusetts.

349
00:29:57,287 --> 00:30:04,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, wanted to sort of update you on what we're thinking about a little bit and hear, you know, what the parallels are.

350
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:13,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the Massachusetts is just starting its next iteration of its climate science report.

351
00:30:13,717 --> 00:30:27,460
[SPEAKER_05]: So the physical climate science piece, the climate projections piece of the Massachusetts report cycle that then feeds in, I think, into the big next update to the vulnerability plan in two years, I think.

352
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:32,441
[SPEAKER_05]: So the climate science report is just starting to spin up now.

353
00:30:33,641 --> 00:30:46,510
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm also looking for any feedback or input on what might be useful from your perspective in terms of what the state should be covering in that report.

354
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not leading that, but I am a contributor.

355
00:30:51,982 --> 00:31:02,592
[SPEAKER_05]: This is our new center with a very unwieldy name, the Massachusetts Gateway City's Climate Resilience Center Powering a Just and Resilient Future.

356
00:31:04,974 --> 00:31:30,851
[SPEAKER_05]: many words that are probably now going to be banned, and with a focus primarily on Lowell, but with an eye towards being able to scale everything we do to other, especially gateway cities, but other, you know, similar sized, kind of mid-sized post-industrial cities in New England, led by our own Professor Rooney Varga and involving several other folks.

357
00:31:33,263 --> 00:31:36,565
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to do a couple of different things.

358
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:44,229
[SPEAKER_05]: This is sort of pretty ambitious in scope, not in funding, but in scope anyway.

359
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:53,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to span going from understanding better about the hot and cold temperature extremes that might be

360
00:31:55,015 --> 00:32:17,611
[SPEAKER_05]: affecting the city and then link that both toward to urban green space, how urban canopy and urban green spaces, rainwater gardens, things like that may be able to mitigate some of the temperature extremes, and then also some energy modeling.

361
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:35,986
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not my piece of this, so I'm still on the steep part of the learning curve, but trying to estimate for individual homes during temperature extremes what that might do to their energy costs.

362
00:32:37,046 --> 00:33:00,685
[SPEAKER_05]: If say, they took advantage of mass save to put in energy efficiency or put in a heat pump or network geothermal, try to run through some of the options and see what that looks like at the energy cost level for an individual, but also start to understand a little bit about the peak power demands as the energy system gets more electrified.

363
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:10,911
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another big piece of this project is to co-develop a lot of this work with the city of Lowell and community members.

364
00:33:11,011 --> 00:33:30,863
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're in regular contact with, you know, folks from the planning office, folks at senior centers, folks at the Cambodian Mutual Aid Association to try to make sure that we're providing information that's sort of actionable and equitable.

365
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:44,906
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the things that we're thinking about, which I think everybody's thinking a lot about, is the green energy transition in Massachusetts.

366
00:33:46,627 --> 00:33:58,810
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding is that the Massachusetts target is to add about half a million heat pumps in the next five years, which is a pretty huge switch.

367
00:33:59,551 --> 00:34:03,692
[SPEAKER_05]: The good news, of course, is that switching to electric heat pumps

368
00:34:05,052 --> 00:34:19,104
[SPEAKER_05]: from gas is at least hypothetically great for decarbonization, probably for indoor air quality as well, but it does put additional stress on the electric grid.

369
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:23,689
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something that we want to understand a little bit.

370
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:42,444
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just to address the sort of literal elephant in the room there, if you'll pardon my slide, the green energy transition, if you transition, of course, to energy production via electricity, that's only green if the electricity is produced with non-fossil fuels.

371
00:34:43,245 --> 00:34:47,568
[SPEAKER_05]: And now our wind energy permitting for the state is in limbo.

372
00:34:47,688 --> 00:34:50,110
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, I think, a pretty big

373
00:34:51,130 --> 00:35:01,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Question mark piece of this curious to hear if anybody has any opinions on that, but it just seems to be a pretty big question mark at the moment and then also.

374
00:35:03,205 --> 00:35:20,557
[SPEAKER_05]: With that increased load, I've heard different estimates, but we'd have to need to substantially build out our regional grid capacity maybe by a factor of two or something approaching that over five years, which is a pretty heavy lift.

375
00:35:20,638 --> 00:35:27,262
[SPEAKER_05]: And my understanding is that was also planned to be or expected to be dependent on federal funds.

376
00:35:28,783 --> 00:35:37,231
[SPEAKER_05]: all the federal uncertainty adding a lot of, passing on a lot of uncertainty to this.

377
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:43,279
[SPEAKER_05]: But one of the things that we're interested in is temperature extremes for this project.

378
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:49,161
[SPEAKER_05]: That's our focus from the climate side of view, but not just heat extremes, but also cold extremes.

379
00:35:50,122 --> 00:35:59,045
[SPEAKER_05]: We're definitely having fewer cold extremes, but we can't quite shut the door on them just yet in this past

380
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:08,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Last month was a pretty good example around the eastern US of still getting some pretty good cold temperatures.

381
00:36:08,952 --> 00:36:13,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Not cold enough for Barry and for my wife, who are really rooting for some snow.

382
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:28,024
[SPEAKER_05]: still certainly going to create an issue in terms of, I think the expectation is that peak electric loads are expected to shift from summer to winter as we continue to electrify.

383
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:36,027
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, of course, blackouts, if you're depending on electricity for your heating, blackouts are a much more immediate

384
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:41,029
[SPEAKER_05]: much higher impact scenario in winter than they would be in summer.

385
00:36:41,630 --> 00:37:04,162
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to understand a little bit about what these plausible worst case scenarios might look like for heat waves and cold snaps, but then also model the energy response to that, as well as what the potential is to mitigate some of that with maybe increased urban canopy

386
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:22,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Other approaches, this isn't part of that particular project, but something that our campus is very interested in, and some other municipalities around the state, I think Worcester has been a leader in this maybe, is network geothermal.

387
00:37:23,997 --> 00:37:47,602
[SPEAKER_05]: So ground source heat pumps instead of air source heat pumps, which are more energy efficient and may be able to take good advantage of existing infrastructure, but provide some challenges in terms of getting neighborhood buy-in and some of the costs involved.

388
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:51,763
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have a project that's getting underway on campus

389
00:37:55,763 --> 00:38:05,585
[SPEAKER_05]: heat and cool some of our buildings and one of the abutting environmental justice communities in Lowell as well, if all goes well.

390
00:38:06,965 --> 00:38:11,666
[SPEAKER_05]: The picture shows drilling the wells on the parking lot.

391
00:38:11,686 --> 00:38:13,086
[SPEAKER_05]: That part has gone smoothly.

392
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:20,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything else is challenging, and I think I've heard from community members that

393
00:38:23,619 --> 00:38:35,595
[SPEAKER_05]: they would like more sort of local input into energy production and that working with a large private company is challenging.

394
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Framingham, I think somebody is pointing out the completed network.

395
00:38:43,265 --> 00:38:45,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Framingham, not Worcester, I guess.

396
00:38:45,208 --> 00:38:46,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you for that.

397
00:38:47,031 --> 00:38:53,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think they've had some challenges, but I think it's been a very nice project there.

398
00:38:57,616 --> 00:39:11,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Another thing that we're thinking about is the new risk environments in a couple of different ways, but I think one that's really stood out this year was the wildfire season.

399
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:24,558
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're hoping this summer to sort of have a closer look at the climate drivers of this past summer and what that might say about

400
00:39:26,381 --> 00:39:31,042
[SPEAKER_05]: future wildfire seasons in Massachusetts.

401
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:39,684
[SPEAKER_05]: You've probably heard the term weather whiplash, where we have hot and then cold, sort of back to back.

402
00:39:40,064 --> 00:39:51,487
[SPEAKER_05]: This past year, last year was a good example of water whiplash, where one month was record wet, and then the next month was record dry, and then the next month was record wet.

403
00:39:52,247 --> 00:39:56,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that increase in variability is expected with climate change.

404
00:39:57,029 --> 00:40:06,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just happened to roll bad dice and get a couple of really dry months right in a row in the fall and paid the price in wildfire.

405
00:40:06,453 --> 00:40:18,478
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're trying to understand whether that was more of a one-off season or more of something that we may experience more frequently in the future.

406
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:31,533
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to work with our community partners to understand better how to communicate climate change.

407
00:40:32,073 --> 00:40:42,215
[SPEAKER_05]: And as Barry said, I've been involved with the IPCC reports and the Boston report, and now the state report.

408
00:40:42,695 --> 00:40:47,217
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know a lot of ways of communicating climate risk that don't work.

409
00:40:49,257 --> 00:40:50,057
[SPEAKER_05]: to communities.

410
00:40:50,617 --> 00:40:55,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're struggling a little bit to figure out what does work.

411
00:40:55,698 --> 00:41:13,321
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think what we're finding, which we kind of knew, but really getting reinforced that, of course, if you're looking in a highly impacted community, which are typically your environmental justice communities, your lower income neighborhoods, things like that, they, of course, have other very big concerns on their mind.

412
00:41:13,441 --> 00:41:14,721
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what's up with my job?

413
00:41:14,761 --> 00:41:16,062
[SPEAKER_05]: What's up with my kid's school?

414
00:41:17,662 --> 00:41:18,502
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're not

415
00:41:19,622 --> 00:41:46,502
[SPEAKER_05]: really in a position to appreciate the degree that anybody is who isn't a climate scientist, different scenarios and things like percentage change and intense rainfall at different warming levels, but more, do I need to worry about flood risk on my street, which is actually a much harder question to answer, but we're trying to get a better handle on

416
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:58,334
[SPEAKER_05]: the information that's available to us, how do we best and most usefully get it across to the folks who can make best use of it?

417
00:41:58,955 --> 00:42:02,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another big piece of that is that the scale of actionable information

418
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:10,489
[SPEAKER_05]: The information that people would like is usually street level or property level or neighborhood they want to know.

419
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:16,756
[SPEAKER_05]: We all want to know what's going to happen in my backyard, what's going to happen in my neighborhood.

420
00:42:17,436 --> 00:42:25,024
[SPEAKER_05]: And that spatial scale, tens of meters, is typically much smaller than the available information.

421
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:36,238
[SPEAKER_05]: So the National Climate Assessment, the national process provides a fair amount of data at the county level is about the smallest they go.

422
00:42:37,479 --> 00:42:46,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And the current plan for projections from the state, the projections that are currently in process are also county level.

423
00:42:48,042 --> 00:42:50,043
[SPEAKER_05]: so not neighborhood level.

424
00:42:50,643 --> 00:43:16,450
[SPEAKER_05]: And the difficulty is that filling some of that information gap in is possible in some cases, but it's a scale that's very difficult to find funding for because it's typically a little expensive on the city side, especially for smaller cities, but it's not typically the type of thing you can ask for federal research funds because they don't,

425
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:21,073
[SPEAKER_05]: want to fund research that's true for one city or a handful of cities.

426
00:43:21,113 --> 00:43:24,877
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to fund research for the whole Northeast or something like that.

427
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:30,742
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's this kind of critical information gap that exists.

428
00:43:30,982 --> 00:43:35,146
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll show a slide of that in a minute.

429
00:43:35,926 --> 00:43:44,293
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is some of the feedback that we've gotten from community members in terms of the climate information,

430
00:43:45,807 --> 00:43:59,692
[SPEAKER_05]: The climate information they're looking for really isn't directly, they don't want the climate information directly in terms of temperature levels or precipitation levels, but how does it factor into the impacts of climate change?

431
00:43:59,732 --> 00:44:13,056
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure I'm not telling you anything you don't already know, but people are less concerned in percentage change in the number of days over 95 degrees Fahrenheit or something like that and more

432
00:44:14,508 --> 00:44:21,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I need to worry this summer about arranging childcare because the school is going to be closed?

433
00:44:21,214 --> 00:44:27,419
[SPEAKER_05]: A question that we got recently is, do I need to worry about fire insurance?

434
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:35,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Are these risks starting to become large relative to the very immediate concerns that folks have?

435
00:44:36,606 --> 00:44:39,409
[SPEAKER_05]: How much do I need to worry about a spike in energy cost?

436
00:44:42,033 --> 00:44:48,076
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I need to have an AC just as a matter of health?

437
00:44:48,296 --> 00:44:59,582
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have an older person in your house, but your income is very limited, an AC may feel like a luxury, but may not actually be a luxury in some cases.

438
00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:05,744
[SPEAKER_05]: which sort of relates again to these kind of spatial scales.

439
00:45:06,786 --> 00:45:13,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I imagine everybody's heard of the urban heat island effect if you're in a part of the city that's heavily paved with very few trees.

440
00:45:14,583 --> 00:45:32,166
[SPEAKER_05]: Typically, those parts of the cities that were redlined historically and are lower income areas of the cities, the typically less desirable parts of the cities, those parts of the cities can be 6, 7, 8, 10, 12 degrees warmer during a heat wave.

441
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:34,527
[SPEAKER_05]: So really substantially warmer.

442
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:42,368
[SPEAKER_05]: This is showing you some results for Boston overlapping the hottest parts of the city with children

443
00:45:44,027 --> 00:45:48,310
[SPEAKER_05]: where there are a lot of children, where there are older adults, where there are medical illnesses.

444
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:54,553
[SPEAKER_05]: So it kind of matters at this neighborhood level where it's going to be really hot.

445
00:45:55,894 --> 00:46:00,997
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really important information to have in terms of understanding impacts.

446
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:04,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And Boston.

447
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:12,068
[SPEAKER_05]: Has some of this info and a few towns, I'm going to say Worcester again, hopefully correctly.

448
00:46:12,088 --> 00:46:22,357
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this time Worcester, I think, did some mapping to try to understand what the hottest neighborhoods were, but most towns don't.

449
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:32,950
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably possible to create this information for every town in Massachusetts, but it doesn't currently exist.

450
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:38,134
[SPEAKER_05]: And Boston has a much larger budget, so they commissioned a very large study.

451
00:46:40,885 --> 00:46:46,647
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably possible to get that information from satellite data, or at least to make an estimate.

452
00:46:47,147 --> 00:46:54,309
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a map of the urban heat island effect all over Massachusetts using satellite data.

453
00:46:54,809 --> 00:47:00,791
[SPEAKER_05]: This is mainly meant to be an artistic map, so it doesn't actually have values on it.

454
00:47:01,472 --> 00:47:03,652
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it does give some flavor

455
00:47:05,973 --> 00:47:12,315
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the difference between the yellow areas and the dark green areas is like 20 degrees or more.

456
00:47:14,275 --> 00:47:21,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're in Western Mass in a valley with a lot of trees, even a heat wave isn't necessarily all that hot.

457
00:47:21,997 --> 00:47:23,718
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you're in Springfield,

458
00:47:26,587 --> 00:47:31,150
[SPEAKER_05]: in an area with very few trees is going to be a much bigger deal.

459
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:38,333
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are some opportunities here to try to make this kind of information available to more towns.

460
00:47:41,134 --> 00:47:44,656
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're trying to figure out a way to get that done.

461
00:47:44,716 --> 00:47:48,318
[SPEAKER_05]: But so far, I don't know if Medford has done that or not, to be honest.

462
00:47:48,638 --> 00:47:50,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Lowell doesn't have this information, I know for sure.

463
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,863
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is probably possible to make it.

464
00:47:54,903 --> 00:47:56,765
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a question of capacity.

465
00:47:58,486 --> 00:47:59,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll just end.

466
00:47:59,107 --> 00:48:04,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, I wanted to hopefully have some time for discussion and hear from you guys a little bit more.

467
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:12,962
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to end on this note of the state climate report is being scoped right now in terms of what it will cover.

468
00:48:14,724 --> 00:48:17,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Resources as with everything are very limited.

469
00:48:17,267 --> 00:48:30,421
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, in terms of what it can cover will be limited, but it's certainly better to ask for what's needed because there may be some capacity.

470
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:31,662
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also, I think,

471
00:48:33,263 --> 00:48:36,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Massachusetts has a relatively new state climate office.

472
00:48:37,224 --> 00:48:46,146
[SPEAKER_05]: The state climate report's going to be a bigger deal this time around, and then I expect the next time around will be much bigger even than this.

473
00:48:46,266 --> 00:49:02,350
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's information that would be very useful at the municipal level, I think the more the state knows that, the more, if it can't do anything quickly, the more it can at least think about that in the medium term.

474
00:49:05,411 --> 00:49:07,991
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I'll go ahead and end it there.

475
00:49:08,991 --> 00:49:15,293
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm definitely happy for any comments or questions or discussion.

476
00:49:15,313 --> 00:49:22,854
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Dan.

477
00:49:22,894 --> 00:49:23,314
[SPEAKER_10]: Go for it.

478
00:49:24,614 --> 00:49:25,875
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks, Matthew.

479
00:49:25,915 --> 00:49:27,495
[SPEAKER_04]: That was incredibly helpful.

480
00:49:28,488 --> 00:49:28,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

481
00:49:29,128 --> 00:49:30,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for presenting.

482
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:32,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

483
00:49:33,091 --> 00:49:50,983
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the big things I took from that though is that a lot of people in our communities are worried about things like their utility bills or costs like reliability of service.

484
00:49:51,723 --> 00:49:57,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm interested how some of this plays into some of the larger regional

485
00:49:58,211 --> 00:49:59,392
[SPEAKER_04]: and national things going on.

486
00:49:59,792 --> 00:50:19,848
[SPEAKER_04]: So things like the central main corridor, you know, getting hydro power down here, you know, nuclear power, um, or even like, you know, gas, um, you know, opposition to gas, um, transmission lines coming up here.

487
00:50:19,928 --> 00:50:25,172
[SPEAKER_04]: So like, how can we, you know, maybe communicate some, uh,

488
00:50:27,972 --> 00:50:37,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Or make sure that people feel comfortable about like kind of near term reliability verse how that impacts longer term climate goals.

489
00:50:38,824 --> 00:50:40,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a great question and

490
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:59,494
[SPEAKER_05]: One that we're sort of wrestling with a little bit, I think my sociology colleagues and political science colleagues would be the first to remind me that I'm a physical scientist, not a political expert.

491
00:51:01,735 --> 00:51:04,297
[SPEAKER_05]: So take whatever I say with a grain of salt.

492
00:51:04,377 --> 00:51:28,156
[SPEAKER_05]: But my understanding is that a really key piece of this is simply communication, just people talking to each other so that everybody understands that the climate piece of this is important and that all these other pieces are important as well, and try to, I think, build a sort of

493
00:51:30,025 --> 00:51:46,153
[SPEAKER_05]: larger community, visible community of support for some of these things, because these are issues that are going to be very hard to push for, I think, in terms of building renewable energy.

494
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:51,455
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, I don't have a

495
00:51:54,214 --> 00:51:56,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure you're asking me to have a good political strategy.

496
00:51:56,635 --> 00:51:57,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure what that is.

497
00:51:57,455 --> 00:52:22,186
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think that one piece of it is if folks understand better what the issues are and if they're talking, if everybody's talking more as a community and they understand that these are big issues for everybody, I think that's how to find a base of support for some of these issues.

498
00:52:25,257 --> 00:52:25,878
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, thanks.

499
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:30,862
[SPEAKER_10]: That looks like Lois is next.

500
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:42,731
[SPEAKER_07]: You mentioned heat pumps versus the underground heat.

501
00:52:44,212 --> 00:52:52,659
[SPEAKER_07]: You talked about when the power will be most needed, blackouts and so forth.

502
00:52:54,527 --> 00:53:00,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Which of those uses the most energy to run?

503
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:08,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there an advantage to one kind over another in regards to blackouts?

504
00:53:11,514 --> 00:53:13,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a great question.

505
00:53:13,255 --> 00:53:18,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think one that we're hoping to get a better handle on, I think

506
00:53:21,048 --> 00:53:27,093
[SPEAKER_05]: The network geothermal, which is the ground source heat pump, that is much more efficient.

507
00:53:27,133 --> 00:53:28,955
[SPEAKER_05]: So it uses less electricity.

508
00:53:29,836 --> 00:53:31,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So that part is good.

509
00:53:32,218 --> 00:53:41,586
[SPEAKER_05]: The challenge with the network geothermal, the network is in the name, it works better if you're running many houses at a time.

510
00:53:42,366 --> 00:53:46,490
[SPEAKER_05]: So an individual person can say, oh, I want a heat pump.

511
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:52,134
[SPEAKER_05]: as an affordable thing.

512
00:53:52,794 --> 00:53:59,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Network geothermal, you can install your own geothermal heat pump, but that's really for people who are really pretty well off.

513
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:02,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It only makes sense, really, if it's a network thing.

514
00:54:02,683 --> 00:54:04,665
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's sort of that trade-off between

515
00:54:07,486 --> 00:54:19,130
[SPEAKER_05]: what uses more electricity but is easier to do for individuals versus what uses less electricity but is much kind of more extensive to set up.

516
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:35,575
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think what we're hoping is that, and I think what everybody who thinks about these things is hoping is that by thinking about these blackout issues now, we'll just avoid getting in a place where there really is a substantial chance of a blackout.

517
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:44,082
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think the plan is to sort of just avoid that by thinking about it ahead of time.

518
00:54:45,443 --> 00:54:50,247
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how feasible that is, but I think that's really the goal.

519
00:54:50,267 --> 00:54:51,307
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

520
00:54:53,049 --> 00:54:56,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

521
00:54:57,532 --> 00:54:58,673
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Barry's hand next.

522
00:55:01,916 --> 00:55:02,356
[SPEAKER_11]: Matt, you

523
00:55:03,739 --> 00:55:06,681
[SPEAKER_11]: said that wind permitting is in limbo for now.

524
00:55:06,981 --> 00:55:27,132
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, I know that the Feds, I know that Trump, among the 4,000 executive orders, has paused siting of wind or stopped it on federal land.

525
00:55:27,633 --> 00:55:27,913
[SPEAKER_11]: But

526
00:55:30,796 --> 00:55:37,264
[SPEAKER_11]: But that shouldn't put it completely on pause in Massachusetts, or does it?

527
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:40,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thanks.

528
00:55:40,528 --> 00:55:42,611
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for asking a question I don't really know the answer to.

529
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:44,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think.

530
00:55:45,874 --> 00:55:46,675
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great question.

531
00:55:46,715 --> 00:56:01,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think the greatest potential and most of the planning was for offshore wind on federal land, but there certainly could be some on non-federal land, on state land, you know, not in the water.

532
00:56:04,092 --> 00:56:10,801
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not under the impression, not something I know that well, I'm not under the impression that that would be a big factor.

533
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:21,034
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think you're also right to point out that that's one of a large number of executive orders, some of which have already been walked back.

534
00:56:22,836 --> 00:56:32,224
[SPEAKER_05]: And ceasing the permitting for offshore wind has huge economic and job implications.

535
00:56:32,344 --> 00:56:37,148
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's maybe not unreasonable to hope that that one gets walked back as well.

536
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:48,938
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so far as I know, the main opportunity for substantial wind energy was offshore, but I could be wrong about that.

537
00:56:52,703 --> 00:56:53,657
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I see Bob next.

538
00:56:55,244 --> 00:56:59,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, just to follow up on that, I'm familiar with offshore wind.

539
00:57:02,488 --> 00:57:09,633
[SPEAKER_03]: And it has the highest potential for energy for insulation costs being offshore.

540
00:57:09,653 --> 00:57:18,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, that falls into the purview of the Department of BOEM, I guess, Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management.

541
00:57:19,198 --> 00:57:21,880
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's unfortunately federally overseen

542
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:30,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there was an issue about seasonality of blackouts for, let's say, electrification.

543
00:57:30,986 --> 00:57:34,708
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have a heat pump system, as well as solar on my roof.

544
00:57:34,728 --> 00:57:38,571
[SPEAKER_03]: And I noticed, well, in the summer, I have plenty of solar.

545
00:57:39,291 --> 00:57:46,736
[SPEAKER_03]: So I basically am still getting credits in the summer, even though my heat pump is cooling my house.

546
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,499
[SPEAKER_03]: But in winter, I have a big penalty, a big electrical penalty.

547
00:57:50,539 --> 00:57:52,040
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's going to happen.

548
00:57:53,188 --> 00:57:55,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, wind is most prevalent in the winter.

549
00:57:56,090 --> 00:58:01,694
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would be, at least in the summer, because you get more storms, et cetera.

550
00:58:02,334 --> 00:58:06,097
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be nice to have wind really promoted.

551
00:58:06,557 --> 00:58:12,381
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to be a key roadblock if the feds have to approve all these things.

552
00:58:13,422 --> 00:58:21,790
[SPEAKER_03]: That's definitely a major issue is we have to have winter electricity, and that has to really come from wind.

553
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:27,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Solar is like puny, especially when the snow covers my solar panels, which has been happening.

554
00:58:29,677 --> 00:58:36,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely, wind is a key to winter electrification, and we definitely have to pay attention to that.

555
00:58:38,325 --> 00:58:39,186
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I totally agree.

556
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:43,503
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Josh.

557
00:58:51,286 --> 00:59:00,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, after five years, you know, since the pandemic, you think I'd have a better handle on where the mute and video buttons are.

558
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:03,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that

559
00:59:04,381 --> 00:59:16,166
[SPEAKER_09]: I think has been challenged for me as an urban planner working for a municipality is the difference in responsibility that utilities have versus the municipalities.

560
00:59:17,747 --> 00:59:28,891
[SPEAKER_09]: It's great that we encourage solar panels here in Medford or wind turbines, but the energy mix is much more down to the decisions of the utilities.

561
00:59:28,951 --> 00:59:30,412
[SPEAKER_09]: And you mentioned earlier about how

562
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:51,330
[SPEAKER_09]: gateway communities in particular have a leeriness to sort of these utility-led programs, and also, you know, short of, you know, re-legalizing new municipal light plants or, like, nationalizing or municipalizing these, like, utilities.

563
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:59,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, what can we do to sort of deal with the utility dominance in the kind of decision-making space?

564
01:00:01,168 --> 01:00:05,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a great question that I wish I knew the answer to.

565
01:00:09,153 --> 01:00:29,157
[SPEAKER_05]: From my personal perspective, which seemed to be the perspective of some of the community folks I was talking to, that the utilities need to be much more heavily regulated or sort of reopen the possibility of new players or co-ops or something like that.

566
01:00:30,517 --> 01:00:36,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that that's particularly feasible in Massachusetts, but the sense I get

567
01:00:38,412 --> 01:00:47,255
[SPEAKER_05]: is that there's a great deal of resistance to a lot of things that pretty desperately need to be done by the existing utilities.

568
01:00:48,435 --> 01:01:00,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a solution, but I suspect that, at the least, a stronger regulatory framework or more bullying from the state is really going to be necessary.

569
01:01:04,181 --> 01:01:04,501
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

570
01:01:07,662 --> 01:01:07,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan?

571
01:01:10,336 --> 01:01:31,081
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, to add a thought to that, I know that there is a lot of interest and opportunity in building things like battery storage and offshore wind in Massachusetts and the New England area.

572
01:01:32,342 --> 01:01:37,383
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of it gets shut down from the regulatory process.

573
01:01:38,464 --> 01:02:05,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, not necessarily from like the utilities, but I'm interested if you have any thoughts on sort of how the kind of state, um, regulatory process might better influence, um, you know, or, or help kind of guide the process of interconnection for, um, you know, renewable sources of energy, um, that would benefit these communities.

574
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:14,073
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of those are going to be kind of utility driven or necessary, you know, to have input from the utilities.

575
01:02:16,478 --> 01:02:19,859
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, unfortunately, I think that's kind of the big question.

576
01:02:19,879 --> 01:02:21,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunately, I don't have a good answer for it.

577
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:36,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the more that communities can talk amongst themselves and have a clear voice, individual communities, more communities can work together so that they have a stronger voice.

578
01:02:38,604 --> 01:02:41,585
[SPEAKER_05]: That seems like an important piece of it.

579
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:57,111
[SPEAKER_05]: Massachusetts is going to start backing itself into legal issues because it does have some legal commitments in terms of reducing its fossil fuel emissions that it simply will not be able to meet unless it starts to move more quickly.

580
01:02:57,131 --> 01:03:00,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if there's a legal avenue there.

581
01:03:03,323 --> 01:03:11,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, just a personal opinion, the lack of transparency on Beacon Hill, I think, is a huge factor.

582
01:03:12,571 --> 01:03:16,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes it's hard to figure out where things get blocked.

583
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:27,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So that may be another area where a strong community voice, coherent community voice across the state

584
01:03:29,605 --> 01:03:30,946
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that it's happened yet.

585
01:03:30,986 --> 01:03:32,268
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know the potential for it.

586
01:03:32,328 --> 01:03:44,419
[SPEAKER_05]: But more connection at the community level between Eastern Mass and Western Mass, I think, could be more of a political force right now.

587
01:03:44,439 --> 01:03:47,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the two sides of the state are kind of played off against each other.

588
01:03:47,942 --> 01:03:54,007
[SPEAKER_05]: But yes, I think that that is a big issue, other than

589
01:03:55,751 --> 01:04:00,133
[SPEAKER_05]: more community voice and maybe there's some legal avenues to be explored.

590
01:04:00,173 --> 01:04:03,494
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have really much to offer, I'm afraid.

591
01:04:03,514 --> 01:04:16,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's difficult where you have projects that could reduce carbon output, could be beneficial to the entire region, but they face both.

592
01:04:17,299 --> 01:04:19,020
[SPEAKER_04]: If you have a three-year interconnection queue,

593
01:04:20,772 --> 01:04:26,758
[SPEAKER_04]: it changes your project economics, then you have local opposition to it, changes that as well.

594
01:04:27,018 --> 01:04:37,748
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot on the regulatory side, I feel like here that blocks the development of beneficial projects.

595
01:04:38,169 --> 01:04:42,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw someone in the chat mentioned Texas, say what you will about Texas,

596
01:04:43,929 --> 01:04:52,053
[SPEAKER_04]: it's very, very easy to build a wind or solar or battery project in Texas, and that has quite a bit of benefits on the grid there.

597
01:04:53,294 --> 01:05:01,578
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that people are moving out of the New England region, trying to build these projects for exactly that reason.

598
01:05:01,759 --> 01:05:05,220
[SPEAKER_04]: It's too hard to get anything done.

599
01:05:05,481 --> 01:05:13,345
[SPEAKER_04]: On a local level, I feel like we need to be supporting these projects in our neighborhoods,

600
01:05:15,094 --> 01:05:19,735
[SPEAKER_04]: against, you know, pushing back against them and adding more regulatory oversight.

601
01:05:20,756 --> 01:05:20,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

602
01:05:21,016 --> 01:05:31,379
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know Barry has a question, but just to sort of reinforce that, I think some of that is maybe a small piece, but I think some of that is community education.

603
01:05:31,439 --> 01:05:34,220
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is kind of a reflexive

604
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:45,161
[SPEAKER_05]: a response to not wanting things in your backyard or as well as a very reasonable response to not wanting your energy costs to go up.

605
01:05:45,201 --> 01:06:00,025
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think if people had a better understanding of what's at stake and how it works and how it can benefit other things at the same time, there might be more community level support.

606
01:06:04,665 --> 01:06:08,468
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, Barry, you might have to take us out with our final question.

607
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:10,609
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

608
01:06:10,829 --> 01:06:12,010
[SPEAKER_11]: I sort of had to.

609
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:30,861
[SPEAKER_11]: But after asking Matt something that he didn't know anything about and scolded me for it, I figured I'd give him a softball that was right up his alley, which is what I think that Medford has done some pretty good mapping around.

610
01:06:33,032 --> 01:06:39,594
[SPEAKER_11]: expectations around flooding, but that it's largely based on anticipated sea level rises.

611
01:06:39,974 --> 01:06:52,377
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wonder if you could talk at all about what unexpectable precipitation events we should expect.

612
01:06:57,023 --> 01:07:05,209
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, after Asheville, that should make us all rather, anybody anywhere, rather nervous.

613
01:07:09,052 --> 01:07:18,599
[SPEAKER_11]: And a second thing, if there's time, which is sort of up your alley, but not quite, is a lot of people,

614
01:07:20,093 --> 01:07:39,591
[SPEAKER_11]: We've started calling Hydro-Quebec clean energy, which I think is horrific, because drowning Tundra and Taiga in order to generate hydropower is releasing a huge amount of carbon.

615
01:07:39,611 --> 01:07:44,535
[SPEAKER_11]: But I don't know if, do you know how, to what degree that's been quantified?

616
01:07:44,555 --> 01:07:44,615
[SPEAKER_11]: And

617
01:07:49,428 --> 01:07:51,549
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's the harder of the two for you.

618
01:07:52,029 --> 01:08:12,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, that's also the one that, again, I know less about, so it's easier to answer for me, which is I think hydropower is the most impactful of the renewable energies, for sure, far and away, and yet is planned to be a pretty substantial piece of our energy puzzle.

619
01:08:12,577 --> 01:08:15,978
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know the full extent of the

620
01:08:16,858 --> 01:08:20,360
[SPEAKER_05]: ecosystem impacts on it, but I'm sure that they're very extensive.

621
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:28,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know in place, you know, existing impacts versus, you know, potential expansion.

622
01:08:29,064 --> 01:08:39,108
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, there's no question that hydropower is, if you will, for short, the dirtiest of the clean energies by far.

623
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:41,169
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of flooding,

624
01:08:44,396 --> 01:08:50,361
[SPEAKER_05]: For Medford specifically, yeah, I think stormwater flooding is a big piece of it.

625
01:08:50,421 --> 01:09:02,751
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, like Lemonster saw and other places have seen around New England the last couple of years where, you know, more or less, not exactly out of nowhere, but you can have these really substantial short

626
01:09:04,333 --> 01:09:14,102
[SPEAKER_05]: but really high impact flooding events, causing all sorts of storm water and sewer outflow issues.

627
01:09:14,303 --> 01:09:15,684
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely a big risk.

628
01:09:16,885 --> 01:09:18,627
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've just been a little lucky so far.

629
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:26,555
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the one that people are trying to wrestle with, including, I think this will come up in the state report, but trying to put some

630
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:35,006
[SPEAKER_05]: numbers, even if they're very qualitative about the potential impact of a tropical cyclone like a hurricane.

631
01:09:35,026 --> 01:09:43,115
[SPEAKER_05]: We do get remnants of hurricanes very regularly and causing high impact precipitation.

632
01:09:43,435 --> 01:09:44,637
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the odds that we could

633
01:09:47,508 --> 01:09:54,053
[SPEAKER_05]: get a really big event that comes right through Boston or Medford.

634
01:09:54,073 --> 01:09:55,475
[SPEAKER_05]: It's certainly possible.

635
01:09:55,755 --> 01:09:59,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not aware of much quantification of that.

636
01:09:59,738 --> 01:10:07,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

637
01:10:11,827 --> 01:10:15,570
[SPEAKER_10]: And mindful of time, but Brenda, take us home.

638
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:17,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you're muted.

639
01:10:17,773 --> 01:10:20,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Brandon, you're muted.

640
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:24,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to mention regarding the flooding.

641
01:10:25,168 --> 01:10:30,470
[SPEAKER_02]: That's one of the missing data points, I think, that would be really helpful if we had on a more local level.

642
01:10:31,571 --> 01:10:33,191
[SPEAKER_02]: We have information about Heat Island.

643
01:10:33,231 --> 01:10:38,413
[SPEAKER_02]: We have information about sea level rise and some of the flooding right along the river.

644
01:10:40,074 --> 01:10:50,838
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we have to go out and get grants for and hire consultants to do on an individual municipality level is that very localized stormwater data.

645
01:10:52,539 --> 01:11:04,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if that was something that was available to municipalities, that would be really helpful, especially for ones that don't have the resources even that Medford has.

646
01:11:06,569 --> 01:11:07,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for sure.

647
01:11:07,229 --> 01:11:17,356
[SPEAKER_05]: That's probably the trickiest problem, but I think it's not out of reach to figure out how to do it once and then

648
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:26,242
[SPEAKER_05]: translate it to every city rather than every city that can afford it does it on their own, which I think is more the model now.

649
01:11:26,302 --> 01:11:28,663
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we could certainly do better there at least.

650
01:11:30,163 --> 01:11:33,844
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also wanted to mention that Tufts is very interested in network geothermal.

651
01:11:34,424 --> 01:11:41,506
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're years out from actually implementing it, but we're very excited at the idea of them doing it too.

652
01:11:41,586 --> 01:11:47,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to be working with them and with National Grid as much as possible along the way.

653
01:11:48,275 --> 01:11:49,615
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I'll have to check in with them.

654
01:11:49,675 --> 01:11:55,636
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, Tufts is obviously just a fantastic resource for Medford.

655
01:11:55,696 --> 01:11:56,556
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would be great.

656
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:03,498
[SPEAKER_10]: With that, we're nearing the close of our meeting.

657
01:12:03,598 --> 01:12:06,858
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want to give a special thank you, Matthew.

658
01:12:07,498 --> 01:12:08,699
[SPEAKER_10]: This was fantastic.

659
01:12:09,619 --> 01:12:13,780
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate you taking the time to share all this with us, answer our questions.

660
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:15,500
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes.

661
01:12:16,656 --> 01:12:18,138
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you very much for having me.

662
01:12:18,158 --> 01:12:18,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I really appreciate it.

663
01:12:21,761 --> 01:12:31,531
[SPEAKER_10]: And with that, I'm going to quickly transition us seamlessly effortlessly to our final moments here in this meeting.

664
01:12:34,172 --> 01:12:43,538
[SPEAKER_10]: The big thing I'd like to do now is get some updates on any outside projects people are working on.

665
01:12:44,899 --> 01:12:58,548
[SPEAKER_10]: To kind of set a precedent going forward, I'd like to close all of our meetings just before new business with 5 to 10 minutes devoted to general updates, what you've been working on, where you're struggling, what you might need help with.

666
01:13:00,493 --> 01:13:14,965
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to kind of open the floor for people that are working on smaller things to share for two, maybe three minutes and talk about what they've been working on and how we as a committee can make ourselves helpful.

667
01:13:19,689 --> 01:13:21,130
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's OK, I can go first.

668
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:23,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Please do.

669
01:13:24,294 --> 01:13:25,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

670
01:13:26,035 --> 01:13:27,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working on two things.

671
01:13:28,235 --> 01:13:36,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we wanted to bring someone from any of the Zero Waste, either Melrose or someone else, to one of our meetings.

672
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:42,240
[SPEAKER_01]: I reached out to Zero Waste Cambridge from Public Works.

673
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:43,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke to Mike Orr.

674
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:46,721
[SPEAKER_01]: I had just like a conversation.

675
01:13:48,502 --> 01:13:53,024
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, how it all started and kind of like the lessons learned type of thing.

676
01:13:53,884 --> 01:14:02,467
[SPEAKER_01]: He did, he was not so keen on coming to a meeting this late in the evening.

677
01:14:02,687 --> 01:14:11,170
[SPEAKER_01]: So as an alternative, at some point, he said, if there are any questions from any of the members, we can pass that along.

678
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:14,331
[SPEAKER_01]: And based on that, he could potentially come.

679
01:14:14,531 --> 01:14:16,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to reach out to other towns as well.

680
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:20,701
[SPEAKER_01]: based on any feedback you all might have.

681
01:14:20,721 --> 01:14:35,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Then the second item is, I floated this idea around to Brenda and Will about an Earth Day or like an Earth Month.

682
01:14:39,188 --> 01:14:47,392
[SPEAKER_01]: Celebration in Medford, without taking too much time, I'm going to quickly share my screen.

683
01:14:47,452 --> 01:14:54,815
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have three quick slides, and then hopefully we can just get some interest, whoever is interested.

684
01:14:54,895 --> 01:15:03,219
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Will is already super interested and super adopter.

685
01:15:03,339 --> 01:15:05,580
[SPEAKER_01]: If someone else too, then we can all just directly

686
01:15:07,677 --> 01:15:09,138
[SPEAKER_01]: have a conversation separately.

687
01:15:09,878 --> 01:15:14,481
[SPEAKER_01]: So without trying to waste any time, I'm going to share my screen.

688
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:21,745
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many millions of other tabs.

689
01:15:21,765 --> 01:15:26,327
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you can see this Canva screen that's right here.

690
01:15:26,767 --> 01:15:30,389
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're seeing your whole desktop, not just the screen.

691
01:15:30,689 --> 01:15:31,190
OK.

692
01:15:39,271 --> 01:15:42,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just a... Much better.

693
01:15:43,353 --> 01:15:44,013
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, great.

694
01:15:44,614 --> 01:15:44,894
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

695
01:15:45,394 --> 01:15:48,076
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is just an idea.

696
01:15:48,096 --> 01:15:50,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, think about it, everyone.

697
01:15:50,317 --> 01:15:51,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would love feedback.

698
01:15:52,298 --> 01:15:53,919
[SPEAKER_01]: Earth Day is on April 22.

699
01:15:54,339 --> 01:15:59,241
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be amazing if we can have a Medford Earth Day celebration.

700
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:11,528
[SPEAKER_01]: And a couple of ideas that, like I said, we briefly discussed and obviously open to any changes and feedback is that we celebrate an Earth Month.

701
01:16:12,468 --> 01:16:25,421
[SPEAKER_01]: in April with like a social media campaign, either posting daily on our Facebook group and or like a website update if possible.

702
01:16:25,441 --> 01:16:34,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we'll have to think about the approvals, logistics, etc., but really just like getting residents engagement.

703
01:16:34,989 --> 01:16:37,312
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is definitely one of the things that the

704
01:16:37,932 --> 01:16:46,997
[SPEAKER_01]: that Mike Orr also highlighted when they started Zero Waste Cambridge is getting the residents and everyone very much engaged.

705
01:16:48,029 --> 01:16:57,134
[SPEAKER_01]: in what we are trying to do, really just like highlighting, you know, either businesses, sustainable businesses, or household zero waste tips.

706
01:16:57,274 --> 01:17:00,955
[SPEAKER_01]: I have like a little flyer on the next slide.

707
01:17:01,676 --> 01:17:15,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other one is have a big zero waste event, the weekend, we could decide on dates, potentially, the weekend after April 22, which is also kind of the last weekend in April.

708
01:17:18,546 --> 01:17:27,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like the social media useful tip of the day, every day could be even something like this.

709
01:17:27,508 --> 01:17:28,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wrote up something.

710
01:17:28,929 --> 01:17:32,129
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously, it's not super crafted.

711
01:17:32,509 --> 01:17:34,850
[SPEAKER_01]: But the idea is we have time.

712
01:17:35,390 --> 01:17:43,372
[SPEAKER_01]: So if some of us can just team up, we can keep all of these ready, approvals,

713
01:17:44,752 --> 01:17:46,613
[SPEAKER_01]: editing, everything can be taken care of.

714
01:17:46,653 --> 01:17:52,177
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a couple of months and two meetings, as Will pointed out, to iron the details.

715
01:17:53,978 --> 01:18:00,022
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, some thoughts that we were thinking about for the big Zero Waste event.

716
01:18:01,583 --> 01:18:06,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a reuse rodeo, Will gave a nice web link to this.

717
01:18:06,666 --> 01:18:10,108
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's on the mass.gov website too.

718
01:18:10,568 --> 01:18:12,430
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, it's like a flea market.

719
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:15,171
[SPEAKER_01]: except that everything is free.

720
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:21,294
[SPEAKER_01]: I know some of us are like part of the everything is free Medford EIFM community as well.

721
01:18:21,354 --> 01:18:22,434
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's online.

722
01:18:22,855 --> 01:18:40,403
[SPEAKER_01]: This is basically an offline or an in-person event where you can donate items, people can exchange, really just to promote reusing and highlighting that it really keeps things away from the landfill.

723
01:18:42,093 --> 01:18:49,354
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could also use that event to, again, spotlight some of the sustainable businesses in and around Medford.

724
01:18:49,594 --> 01:19:00,696
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have a few logistical items to figure out, like location, contacting the business, really doing the newsletter, social media campaign, and other stuff.

725
01:19:00,737 --> 01:19:07,898
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would love any volunteers to work on this and we can

726
01:19:09,058 --> 01:19:15,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it'd be a great opportunity for us to engage the community on our zero waste or low waste efforts.

727
01:19:17,656 --> 01:19:20,441
[SPEAKER_01]: I've stopped sharing and would love to hear thoughts.

728
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Looking just mostly at the clock more than anything.

729
01:19:28,785 --> 01:19:32,390
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to remind folks, we have all of our individual emails.

730
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:40,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So, if you want to reach out to independently with thoughts, concerns, questions, whatever, please do that.

731
01:19:41,008 --> 01:19:45,632
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also want to remind everyone that my email is up there, so you should reach out to me as well.

732
01:19:45,812 --> 01:19:57,742
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want something publicized to the whole MEC group, if you have an idea, a thought, a concern, a haiku, maybe not a haiku, but whatever I can publicize to the group, I will do that as well.

733
01:19:59,023 --> 01:20:04,248
[SPEAKER_10]: But I love these ideas, and I want to, well, keep talking about these, I'm sure.

734
01:20:04,268 --> 01:20:06,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.

735
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:06,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Phil.

736
01:20:11,704 --> 01:20:12,064
[SPEAKER_10]: Loretta.

737
01:20:12,084 --> 01:20:14,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, I liked the idea.

738
01:20:14,728 --> 01:20:18,112
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to add that's a really busy week and Arabiday is that Friday.

739
01:20:18,132 --> 01:20:20,214
[SPEAKER_08]: And usually the city has events.

740
01:20:20,735 --> 01:20:25,781
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's always like a lot going on with Earth Week and Arabiday.

741
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:26,141
[SPEAKER_08]: So if.

742
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,824
[SPEAKER_08]: we decide to help with this project.

743
01:20:29,844 --> 01:20:37,906
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we need some volunteers instead of up my alley for coordinating events in the past.

744
01:20:38,546 --> 01:20:44,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure that Therese Medford and the city would help with that too, but they usually keep it separate.

745
01:20:44,227 --> 01:20:51,509
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've never had an actual Earth Day celebration that I'm aware of, but I just wanted to share that with you that that's Friday.

746
01:20:51,529 --> 01:20:53,830
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure what day the city's celebrating it.

747
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:54,790
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be that day.

748
01:20:57,466 --> 01:21:05,469
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also, there's usually a community cleanup that weekend at some point as well, I think sort of around the theme of Earth Day.

749
01:21:05,489 --> 01:21:07,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right.

750
01:21:07,690 --> 01:21:09,571
[SPEAKER_01]: So we probably want to do a different day then.

751
01:21:11,252 --> 01:21:12,912
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's been scheduled yet, though.

752
01:21:12,932 --> 01:21:14,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen it on the calendar.

753
01:21:17,114 --> 01:21:19,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I really like the zero waste one.

754
01:21:21,075 --> 01:21:26,218
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a great idea to put on something like that.

755
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:27,158
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be.

756
01:21:27,662 --> 01:21:27,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

757
01:21:33,544 --> 01:21:38,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, I can give, we have three full minutes.

758
01:21:38,846 --> 01:21:42,667
[SPEAKER_10]: I know Lois and Benji were also working on some projects.

759
01:21:42,907 --> 01:21:49,609
[SPEAKER_10]: If anyone else would like to share briefly, we'll try to find more time in the future to keep this going.

760
01:21:59,767 --> 01:22:01,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Any closing updates?

761
01:22:01,028 --> 01:22:08,811
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

762
01:22:10,172 --> 01:22:20,297
[SPEAKER_10]: And then final moments for any new business, anything on people's minds, things that people think need to be brought to our attention.

763
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:29,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

764
01:22:31,975 --> 01:22:34,596
[SPEAKER_10]: It's exactly 758 Monday night.

765
01:22:35,636 --> 01:22:36,016
[SPEAKER_10]: I get it.

766
01:22:36,336 --> 01:22:36,737
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm there.

767
01:22:39,117 --> 01:22:40,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd entertain any further motions.

768
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:44,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to adjourn.

769
01:22:49,001 --> 01:22:50,361
[SPEAKER_10]: Looks like Louis is seconding it.

770
01:22:50,381 --> 01:22:52,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I will take that.

771
01:22:52,742 --> 01:22:53,482
[SPEAKER_10]: It has to count.

772
01:22:54,263 --> 01:22:54,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.
