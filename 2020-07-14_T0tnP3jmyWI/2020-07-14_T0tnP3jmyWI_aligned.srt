00:00:00,148 --> 00:00:01,970
Good afternoon Medford Mustang community.

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:07,056
So my name is Dr. Cushing and this is Suzanne Galussi.

3
00:00:07,076 --> 00:00:18,210
And we are so excited that we are here today with a lottery because we have such great participation and people looking to volunteer for our reopening task force and the work groups therein.

4
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:28,034
I just want to say that we were looking for parent and caregiver voices for that to bring that perspective to this working team.

5
00:00:28,134 --> 00:00:30,275
So we value that.

6
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:41,679
And for the parents and caregivers that don't get selected through this lottery process, we will be reaching out to you to get your feedback through a different means of communication.

7
00:00:42,479 --> 00:00:43,660
And so we are here today.

8
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,221
Filming with us is our superintendent resident, Tom Malachewski.

9
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:51,028
and is Kim Miles, our District Data Specialist.

10
00:00:51,648 --> 00:01:00,432
Kim does not live in Medford, and she has no stake in the game, except she wants to see the best outcome possible for our students, as does every educator in Medford.

11
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:08,134
So, Kim is going to run a random number generator to generate our lottery.

12
00:01:09,275 --> 00:01:12,176
The magic will happen at the printer.

13
00:01:13,737 --> 00:01:20,843
You all received an email from Dr. Cushing last night with your lottery number in the subject line.

14
00:01:21,683 --> 00:01:30,010
Once Kim generates, using her platform, the numbers, Dr. Cushing will just read them out loud.

15
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,313
And then we will email them to you later.

16
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:37,035
We will email you later.

17
00:01:37,355 --> 00:01:41,679
Normally we would have a drum roll, but the band is not in session.

18
00:01:42,595 --> 00:01:44,156
And COVID.

19
00:01:46,057 --> 00:01:46,718
Cue music.

20
00:01:49,059 --> 00:01:51,160
Take one minute, it'll be up.

21
00:01:54,122 --> 00:01:56,504
The hamster inside the computer is working hard.

22
00:01:57,044 --> 00:01:57,764
And here we go.

23
00:01:57,844 --> 00:01:58,845
To generate the numbers.

24
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:06,430
This is your drum roll.

25
00:02:16,765 --> 00:02:26,907
extra extra sheet all right first we have number 12 number 123 number 104 number 59 number 143 122 135 106

26
00:02:45,678 --> 00:02:59,402
124, 142, 133, 140, 106, 005, so that's just number five, but I want to read the leading zeros to break it up there.

27
00:02:59,422 --> 00:03:00,643
Number 39, number 85, and number 89.

28
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:01,703
So again, we have 89, 85, 39, five, 106, 104,

29
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:16,699
59, 12, 123, 143, 122, 135, 124, 142, 133, and 140.

30
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:19,201
Thank you very much, everybody.

31
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:23,385
This has been Peter Cushing and Suzanne Galussi, and it's a great day to be a Mustang.

32
00:03:23,405 --> 00:03:23,645
Thank you.
