    <p>[Coulter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=349.816s">Yes,</a>  hi, National Grid is intending to place three conduits down Main Street <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=354.763s">and</a>  approximately right in front of the fire station, down beyond the medical building, attaching two manholes together. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=361.565s">This</a>  will allow us to place a new piece of cable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=364.445s">The</a>  existing infrastructure that is there is no longer usable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=368.066s">It's</a>  collapsed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=369.106s">We</a>  can't get our cable through. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=370.647s">So</a>  we're intending to place a new conduit down through that area.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=375.388s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=377.168s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=378.649s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=379.869s">What</a>  time of day will this work be? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=382.97s">You</a>  can determine that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=384.301s">okay</a>  so we can do something at night because right now that area is a mess traffic wise so and the last piece I know maybe the city engineer the paving was that going to be curb to curb?</p>

    <p>[Coulter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=397.915s">Working</a>  with Owen we're our intention right there is to do the bike lane portion of that and <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=406.117s">we</a>  are going to be responsible for the entire square footage of the curb to curb paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=412.062s">Um,</a>  that could be done anywhere else in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=414.743s">That</a>  was the intention.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=416.265s">So</a>  we'll be done curb to curb.</p>

    <p>[Coulter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=418.026s">Uh,</a>  that particular area will be, um, the bike lane, the distance of the bike lane, approximately three ft. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=423.77s">So</a>  we won't go all the way curb to curb in that area, not to just to keep that a narrower excavation trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=431.192s">But</a>  in place of doing the curb to curb that we are responsible for, we will do that in another area of the city.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=439.974s">City</a>  engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=441.414s">Yeah,</a>  if you want to come up, you can explain that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=445.495s">Thanks,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=445.995s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=446.856s">I</a>  just didn't hear perhaps.</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=449.096s">So,</a>  hi, I'm Owen were tell a city hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=454.667s">We</a>  have discussed this with National Grid about the restoration limits going curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=462.152s">Once</a>  we've just repaved it seemed that it could be more problematic in that scenario where they could undermine what we just did. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=471.699s">So</a>  we limited it <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=473.84s">the</a>  restoration to the bike lane so that they could do a saw cut line on the paint line, and then it would seal the seam and then come back through and do the painting of the bike lane and milling and paving in that area.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=485.545s">Okay,</a>  but are we now in the practice, because it's great news if it is, but that now our public utilities that come in to open up our streets, it'll be curb to curb like we do with the private entities as well?</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=498.97s">That</a>  is normally the case, yes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=500.23s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=500.69s">All</a>  right, that's great.</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=501.771s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=502.998s">If</a>  I could just engineer we're tall. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=505.079s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=506.319s">And</a>  my understanding is in this case because it's brand new In this case we would feel that going milling curb to curb right would undermine what we've just Right, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=519.224s">So</a>  you're gonna do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=520.085s">But</a>  then the square footage that they otherwise would have been responsible for we're gonna get repaid somewhere else I'd love to take it if we can Elm Street <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=531.873s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=533.754s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=533.914s">I</a>  just want to make sure, cause that sounds like it, that should be, that seems fair to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=538.196s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=539.937s">I,</a>  there was a point in here about sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=543.759s">I</a>  just wanted to make sure that when we redo the sidewalks that we're doing them with concrete and not asphalt, I see.</p>

    <p>[Coulter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=552.043s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=553.664s">We</a>  should have like for like, they are concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=555.325s">They</a>  will be returned as concrete.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=557.006s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Coulter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=557.426s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=557.986s">Now,</a>  if I can, while the engine is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=562.41s">How</a>  long, again, will the process take for this project?</p>

    <p>[Coulter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=566.192s">We're</a>  anticipating approximately one week of completion.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=569.654s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=569.934s">So</a>  I think that two reasons for the question, that area is a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=575.257s">I</a>  think we all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=577.218s">Now</a>  that it's all right turns there, I mean, that area's just flooded in the morning now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=582.941s">This</a>  could be something done at night with the city's request. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=586.623s">Is</a>  there a better time to do it?</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=588.624s">It</a>  would be at the discretion of the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=591.638s">Police,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=593.499s">All</a>  right, we'll have that conversation.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=599.023s">For</a>  safety reasons, we would defer to the traffic sergeants. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=602.906s">And</a>  that's something that if we can, as part of the record, we'll reach out as part of a motion to reach out to the chief of police to request their thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=618.276s">And</a>  if it's not that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=621.007s">a</a>  detailed informational plan that goes out to our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=625.23s">And</a>  just because that, I take that, I think everybody knows that trip. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=630.494s">We've</a>  heard phone calls and emails from multiple residents about that right turn only being a major change. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=637.319s">And</a>  then if you drive through Medford Square, now you see why, but I think that making sure that everybody's informed of what happens if it does happen during the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=645.765s">But</a>  thank you, ma'am.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=647.326s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=647.586s">Would</a>  you like to make that a P paper? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=648.707s">Please,</a>  if you can. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=650.788s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=652.348s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=653.529s">An</a>  engineer should we amend the conditions here to reflect the additional paving that we were just so graciously told that the National Grid would like? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=661.591s">Do</a>  you have suggestions we amend number five to reflect that? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=665.371s">Do</a>  you feel like we need to change? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=667.112s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=667.412s">I</a>  have a suggestion. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=669.192s">I'm</a>  here for questions.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=670.453s">Yeah,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=671.173s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=672.953s">Any</a>  other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=673.513s">We</a>  do have to open the hearing to any other questions for councilors at this time.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=677.042s">Just</a>  I would move to amend condition five to reflect that National Grid will, you know, pave another portion of road in the city based on the square footage of what they would have paved curb to curb.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=691.573s">Should</a>  we take that now before we open up the public hearing or after? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=699.708s">I'll</a>  take the motion now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=701.009s">So</a>  we have a motion from Vice Mayor Bears to amend condition number five to reflect the curb-to-curb paving that will be done in another part of the city in lieu of this specific parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=712.658s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=714.24s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=722.506s">And</a>  then, while he's writing that down, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=726.221s">So</a>  we have a policy ordinance in the city as far as not reopening our streets again right after we paved them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=732.944s">It's</a>  five years, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=734.524s">Is</a>  this because this infrastructure has collapsed and this is considered an emergency or just because it's a public utility? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=741.927s">How</a>  is this occurring, I guess?</p>

    <p>[Wartella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=744.368s">I</a>  would recommend that council asks National Grid why this is considered an emergency work 16 months after the case.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=752.291s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=754.296s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=754.976s">Could</a>  you tell us why this is considered?</p>

    <p>[Coulter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=757.097s">Yeah,</a>  it's we've been working through multiple permitting issues trying to accomplish this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=763.519s">So</a>  it did take some time to start that whole process.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=766.4s">So</a>  yeah, you would have done this earlier.</p>

    <p>[Coulter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=768.401s">We</a>  would have done this early. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=770.162s">That's</a>  that's correct.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=771.342s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=772.262s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=773.443s">Um,</a>  so, Mr. Clerk, call the roll on the motion from vice bears to amend condition five.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=847.987s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli's B paper is to <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=856.41s">ask</a>  the chief of police for his thoughts on this matter, and then to get a detailed information plan to go out to residents.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1072.005s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1074.579s">I</a>  could go through everything, but then I would leave nothing for my fellow councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1078.542s">But</a>  there was a litany of procedural errors and issues with the administration of this election, many of which I personally believe would not have occurred had the department been fully funded as this council requested and had the department not had staff turnover as this council also requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1100.37s">There's</a>  a listing here, the ones that I really want to bring to light right now that I'm sure my fellow councillors will talk about other issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1108.832s">Last</a>  election, November 2022, the state election, the city also released incomplete, unofficial results that did not include, to my knowledge, early in mail voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1120.591s">I</a>  don't know if that's what happened last Tuesday, but incomplete, unofficial results were once again released to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1129.438s">We</a>  had been told, as we asked for an update on the previous election, that this would be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1133.24s">It</a>  was clearly not fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1136.423s">folks</a>  were here for up to at least four hours after polls had closed, maybe even longer than that, trying to fix an issue that shouldn't have been an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1145.006s">I</a>  just want to put that out there that left a lot of folks in the community concerned about how ballots are being counted, etc., having a complete tally and accurate unofficial results. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1158.111s">I</a>  also just want to put out there that <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1160.689s">Again,</a>  incorrect information was given to voters both by mail and at polling locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1167.112s">Incorrect</a>  information as to the date that mail ballots should be returned and a sheet went out that was for the previous year's election. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1173.514s">That</a>  should not have happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1175.675s">And</a>  folks were being told that they could not bring materials into the booths to assist them or provide guidance to them while they were voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1184.019s">And</a>  that's against the state voter bill of rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1185.86s">So</a>  again, that's just a couple of the things that I want to bring to bear. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1189.162s">I</a>  know other folks have other things they want to bring to bear. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1191.703s">I</a>  just think it is a serious issue when we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1198.786s">I</a>  don't believe that any of these issues resulted in an outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1202.789s">that</a>  is different from what the outcome should have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1205.47s">However,</a>  we need to have beyond reproach trust in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1210.933s">You</a>  can't have mistakes like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1212.293s">You</a>  certainly can't have series of mistakes and errors like this because perception is reality to a lot of folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1219.916s">And</a>  there's going to be people who won't believe anything that I'm saying forever about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1223.898s">And</a>  that's a shame. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1225.459s">We</a>  need to have full trust of as many people as possible in this community and the absolute <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1233.023s">and</a>  unimpeachable integrity of the electoral process and errors like these hurt that mission. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1239.155s">So</a>  I hope that we will get <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1240.991s">very</a>  quick guidance and explanation as to why things happen the way they happen, and quite frankly, very quick action from the mayor to make sure that they don't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1249.797s">And</a>  I think that action needs to come, not just in reporting to us what went wrong and how they're gonna do better next time, because that's what they did last time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1258.023s">We</a>  got a report about how we're gonna do better, and then a lot of the same things happened again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1261.406s">So</a>  it's an office that needs to be funded and needs to be staffed appropriately so that you don't have errors like this occurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1267.57s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1270.661s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1274.645s">I</a>  think Councilor Bears is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1277.127s">I'm</a>  not here disputing the results of the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1280.61s">They</a>  are what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1282.952s">But</a>  it's the integrity of the office that's the question here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1288.637s">And</a>  this isn't a question just for MEDFED. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1291.899s">This</a>  is why throughout the whole country <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1295.467s">We're</a>  seeing people losing faith in elections by exactly what happened in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1301.829s">It's</a>  not a Trump thing or a thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1303.69s">But</a>  again, I was a full supporter of bringing in an election coordinator because I thought we would do a better job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1312.994s">And</a>  the job has gotten worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1317.555s">If</a>  I had to do that vote over again, I would have probably left to keep it in the hands of the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1321.997s">Because</a>  when the clerk ran the elections in prior years, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1325.298s">We've</a>  never, ever had these kinds of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1328.601s">People</a>  sitting here till 1 o'clock in the morning, waiting for ballots, waiting for questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1333.626s">You</a>  had tapes that didn't add up to the results that were posted. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1337.77s">Numerous,</a>  numerous errors, like Councilor Beall said, dating back to, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1345.087s">printing</a>  of the ballots, wrong instructions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1347.869s">People</a>  get, I don't know how our computer system allowed us to print out three and four ballots per person, per household in different wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1358.818s">I</a>  came in here with a stack of eight ballots in one house. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1363.402s">How</a>  does that happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1365.123s">We</a>  have no idea how many of those ballots were sitting out there with no accountability. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1371.589s">How</a>  many ballots did we print? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1372.87s">How</a>  many ballots are left over now? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1374.887s">again,</a>  counting ballots that were supposed to be in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1383.029s">Those</a>  things just shouldn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1385.11s">And</a>  I say, and this is the reason people don't want to come out and vote, not just in here, but throughout the country, because of the integrity of what goes on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1395.533s">We've</a>  investigated people in this building, the lesser things, I think, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1403.003s">Some</a>  sort of outside audit needs to be done to find out why these mistakes occurred again and again, especially when Secretary of State's called you in the morning of that election telling you were doing things wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1415.332s">And</a>  after they hung up on you, your people went back and said, don't listen to what they told you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1420.075s">You</a>  do what I tell you to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1421.677s">That's</a>  not how this process is supposed to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1424.058s">So</a>  be fair and equal to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1425.359s">You</a>  shouldn't be telling people who to vote for in elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1428.101s">You</a>  shouldn't be telling people what <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1431.195s">What</a>  kind of materials? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1432.635s">If</a>  somebody wants to bring something in their pocket with them, then they're allowed to do it, as long as it's not open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1438.677s">We</a>  had improper training of the officials here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1441.357s">We</a>  were understaffed at the polls. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1444.458s">Every</a>  election, we always had someone checking in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1448.359s">That's</a>  not the process anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1450.66s">Again,</a>  I'm not disputing the results. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1453.9s">I'm</a>  not saying they would have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1455.321s">I'm</a>  just disputing the integrity of the office.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1468.234s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1469.494s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears and Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1472.456s">I</a>  think that my frustration is what's felt throughout the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1475.918s">You</a>  said something very important because what bothered me more than anything in this time in our country, you want people to get involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1484.423s">And</a>  I had five to six people call me and say, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1488.426s">I'll</a>  never, ever vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1492.907s">in</a>  an election for the city ever again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1496.09s">I'll</a>  leave my vote just the national agenda and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1498.552s">Because</a>  that's how disgusted they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1501.614s">And</a>  I can see why, being part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1503.936s">This</a>  is, and I'll give you an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1508.079s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello did, in running his election. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1512.002s">He</a>  was honest, he was fair, he worked hard, and he asked volunteers to come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1517.859s">And</a>  those volunteers came out to assist, like any candidate could. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1523.242s">Any</a>  candidate could have done what Councilor Caraviello did. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1526.124s">Now,</a>  it didn't come out in his favor, and that's life. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1531.386s">But</a>  to hear the horrific issues that poll workers were put in, and the poll watchers, so people don't know, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1544.954s">you're</a>  allowed to have poll watchers, and it's a machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1548.095s">So</a>  the poll watchers go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1549.375s">It's</a>  a calculated strategy where they're allowed to have poll watchers sit in a relatively close area that you can hear and see the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1563.46s">The</a>  process is very simple, that the poll watchers <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1567.887s">There</a>  was talk that they were told they can't sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1572.65s">Then</a>  they were told they can't sit down if they bring their own seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1576.072s">And</a>  if that's the case, OK, bring your own seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1578.434s">Pole</a>  watchers sat in their seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1582.277s">And</a>  then they were told to move 25 feet away. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1586.293s">And</a>  then the process was very simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1588.054s">The</a>  process that by law states, in the general laws that we had attorneys pass out to each polling station, each warden, and it said straight out, the process is such, when the person approaches to vote, if they have a license or not, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1609.588s">because</a>  we had the new scanning system. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1611.388s">And</a>  believe me, I do not blame the poll, the workers that are at the poll, I don't blame them, because a lot of them are great people and they just weren't prepared, but they had the licenses. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1623.671s">They</a>  have the license, you're supposed to sweep their name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1628.612s">They're</a>  supposed to say, George Scarpelli, 27 Butler Street, and the poll worker responds back, George Scarpelli, correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1637.938s">for</a>  the purpose of clarity and transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1642.105s">And</a>  then what they do is that person has a book, same as the workers do, and they check off who comes in and votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1650.632s">And</a>  then if you have a machine that works for you, volunteers that want to work for you, you then have people pick up those books every two to four hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1658.16s">And</a>  then you have people in offices or at homes calling people and saying, hey, we see you haven't voted today. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1665.047s">Do</a>  you need a ride? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1666.328s">It's</a>  a machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1667.008s">It's</a>  done all over the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1669.869s">What</a>  we saw this past Tuesday, I'm not even gonna bring up a formal, maybe I will, because I said what happened before, I said, please, this is why this country is such a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1682.778s">Conspiracy</a>  theories through the roof, and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I hate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1687.781s">And</a>  what happened this past week and the weeks before this and understanding how this process went was a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1698.098s">How</a>  much money did we lose? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1700.659s">When</a>  you don't open up the boxes of the ballots to a few days before you have to mail out the mailing ballots, and you realize you have someone's name spelt wrong, so they have to be thrown away. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1714.745s">Now</a>  you have to get ballots reprinted and rushed in, which is thousands of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1720.848s">And</a>  then they go out and then we realize that we're getting phone calls from Ward 6 saying everybody that ordered, that requested four ballots got eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1728.871s">Everybody</a>  that got asked for two got four. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1731.112s">Everybody</a>  asked for three got six. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1733.613s">And</a>  then we had to reassure the public that even though it looks bad, they cannot vote three to six times. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1741.416s">And</a>  we said that day, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1743.61s">that</a>  meeting before the election, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1746.152s">If</a>  it's because you're understaffed, ask for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1748.894s">If</a>  we have to approve anything from this council to assist, bring in a thousand people from the state, whoever you need to assist. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1756.779s">Now,</a>  Councilor Caballero's team was very proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1761.603s">I</a>  know for sure, because my wife was one of the poll watchers, that at her location, she showed up at seven where polls open, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1768.728s">Well,</a>  at 7.30, they still weren't ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1772.736s">Then</a>  we heard some places that we had machines that weren't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1777.438s">By</a>  law, when you test a machine, the notice has to go out to the public and it has to be done in an open process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1787.841s">Before</a>  the election, that process has to be open to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1791.342s">They</a>  come in and you can watch the Elections Commission test the machines. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1798.124s">That</a>  didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1799.945s">That</a>  didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1801.66s">And</a>  then as you went through the whole process, we will tell you that we were given a notice from the election director that said, the votes that were taken, the votes that were taken from early voting and absentee voting will be put through the voting machine here at City Hall at 8.30 in the morning and then posted at eight o'clock here at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1829.619s">That's</a>  a memo <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1831.616s">that's</a>  public that went out to the election officials, elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1836.818s">And</a>  then you realize, now you go through the numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1840.339s">You</a>  sit there and you go through the numbers, you have people getting their numbers, and it's a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1847.462s">There</a>  was talks that people coming back saying that the police were being yelled at by wardens, that ballots were being counted, they didn't understand where the ballots were. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1855.805s">We</a>  had people here counting ballots without being in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1863.071s">Now</a>  that's, that's, it's, it's not to, it's, it's, it's, is it, does it affect the election? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1871.817s">No,</a>  I don't think it affects the election, but the perception of it is terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1878.082s">And</a>  if this happens in any other, any other department, things have to be taken swiftly and quickly and making sure this doesn't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1889.891s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1891.417s">I'm</a>  gonna ask for, if we can, as a resolution, I would amend the existing paper to ask for our election commissioner, our election director, our commission, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1909.14s">to</a>  come before this council to explain in detail what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1915.943s">And</a>  one of the biggest questions I have from a lot of people that were waiting that night at 835, we had probably between, I believe it was 10,500 votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1925.408s">And</a>  they said, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1930.068s">And</a>  we said, wait a second, Medford has never, never been that low. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1935.351s">What</a>  happened to the ballots that were counted in the morning? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1937.533s">We</a>  don't know what you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1941.035s">So</a>  then all of a sudden at one o'clock in the morning, they posted something that said they found the ballots and it was 4,000 more ballots and this is what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1950.421s">Regardless</a>  who won, who lost, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1952.654s">That</a>  just doesn't look good. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1955.718s">Perception</a>  is reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1957.299s">And</a>  this is what, this is the type of situation that brings the fire to the ignorance of our country sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1966.11s">And</a>  that's what's sad about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1967.811s">So</a>  the reason for this, the reason why I want to move forward and, and get a detailed report, and then ask for, you know, the Secretary of State's office to get involved to them do an audit, because we need answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1981.581s">So</a>  people can understand that your elected officials are holding people accountable when they're not doing their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1988.145s">So</a>  we can squash <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1989.846s">and</a>  move forward for our next elections without any other issues or concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1994.629s">Because</a>  like Councilor Behr said, perception is reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=1997.671s">I</a>  said it the night, the week before the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2000.132s">Perception</a>  is reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2001.473s">And</a>  what happened is exactly what we would hope, we were scared would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2007.157s">Now</a>  you have a room full of people that are just as upset because the process was terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2014.321s">It</a>  was terrible and somebody has to be held accountable, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2018.872s">Because</a>  in my position, if I left a little kid in the park by himself unattended, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2025.333s">The</a>  next morning, I wouldn't be working. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2029.314s">So</a>  in the elections department, when you make these many mistakes, something has to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2036.136s">So</a>  Madam President, that's my resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2039.456s">I</a>  appreciate it and thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2041.437s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2050.478s">Councilor</a>  say.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2052.02s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2053.281s">I</a>  think what's been said here really encapsulates what what went wrong process really does matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2058.747s">Um</a>  I think we all agree that the results wouldn't have changed, but the process really doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2064.974s">And</a>  Councilor <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2067.156s">Scarpelli</a>  is absolutely right when he says that perception is reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2071.399s">We</a>  know that this is a really difficult time for democracy in our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2074.741s">We</a>  know that there's a lot of questions about elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2078.243s">And</a>  we know that we need to build trust in our election system. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2083.166s">And</a>  that trust, it's not just about trusting the election system. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2087.409s">It's</a>  about having unimpeachable trust in the election system. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2092.172s">Elections</a>  are the holiest part of our democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2096.555s">And</a>  our democracy is a sacred system in itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2098.699s">And</a>  we need to really we need to defend it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2100.662s">We</a>  need to make sure the process works. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2104.932s">I,</a>  we, you know, we, the other Councilors have really, I think, well enumerated the number of issues that we saw before election day and on election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2114.997s">And</a>  we gave, and before this election as well, we gave the administration a fair chance to fix their mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2123.782s">We</a>  passed resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2126.603s">We</a>  demanded scrutiny. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2127.844s">We</a>  went through those items line by line. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2131.106s">We</a>  got assurances that they would be fixed for future elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2134.268s">And</a>  we see what the product is today. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2136.674s">We</a>  need... <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2138.842s">We</a>  need not only to know why what went wrong went wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2142.644s">We</a>  need to know what accountability looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2146.787s">We</a>  need to demand that accountability as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2148.968s">And</a>  it's good that we've had safeguards in our system to fall back on, like the barcodes that guarantee that each person only has one vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2159.815s">But</a>  we shouldn't have to rely on our safeguards to have faith in our system. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2163.598s">We</a>  should have faith just because the process has done well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2167.92s">and</a>  so there's not much I can add on to what's been said because I think what's been said encapsulates pretty well what we need to fix, the accountability we need to demand, but I just wanted to put my thoughts and statements on the record as well.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2183.844s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2184.464s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2186.384s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, and I appreciate the councilors who brought this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2189.585s">I</a>  want to affirm what all of my colleagues have said so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2194.146s">It</a>  shouldn't need to be restated that <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2197.489s">Our</a>  constituency deserves an elections office that is fully equipped at any time to defend full and fair access for every single voter. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2206.836s">Individual</a>  staff members and volunteers and elected should not be having to fill the gaps or notice gaps or individually lobby or push staff members to do the right thing and correct issues at the 11th hour on election day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2219.425s">But</a>  this was the case last Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2221.266s">That</a>  was my experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2222.767s">It's</a>  alarming. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2224.515s">for</a>  anybody who works with City Hall in any capacity as an elected, as an appointed, or as a volunteer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2230.02s">That</a>  should never be an option, let alone be necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2234.184s">I</a>  think we all agree if even one voter is unable to cast their ballot because of incorrect mail ballot return information or unable to cast their ballot because they were <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2247.612s">you</a>  know, aspersions were cast about, can I bring my voter guide into the ballot? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2251.296s">Or</a>  even if that concern is arisen, that concern isn't supposed to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2254.979s">That's</a>  why we have voter rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2256.06s">That's</a>  why they're extremely important in this city, throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2260.905s">If</a>  we are condoning those issues in our elections office, even for one voter, then we've failed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2266.45s">that's</a>  how high of a bar that we have to have for elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2270.271s">As</a>  Councilor Scarpelli and others mentioned, we're in an age where, unfortunately, people are out looking for reasons to cast aspersions on the voting process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2278.233s">We</a>  cannot continue to open the city up to this kind of liability, and it's extremely frustrating because the City Council has brought up this issue before. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2289.896s">We've</a>  tried to prevent this issue from happening before it happened for a second time, and it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2297.291s">And</a>  we are saying now, as a council, we can't condone a disorganized and inconsistent voting experience, or even really a difficult voting experience for any voter. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2306.341s">That's</a>  not how it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2308.923s">Voting</a>  isn't a privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2310.185s">It's</a>  a right, and it shouldn't be difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2312.007s">It</a>  should be easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2312.627s">And</a>  it was difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2317.599s">I</a>  appreciate the resolution to ask the administration for appropriation to fulfill full staffing in the elections office. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2325.525s">I</a>  think that's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2327.167s">I</a>  think we saw it was necessary before this election. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2330.748s">And</a>  now I think that we're again seeing the symptoms of an underfunded essential municipal service. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2337.392s">I</a>  think that we need to see this office restored to its full capacity because this is what a lack of capacity looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2343.676s">We</a>  need to see what accountability looks like, as Councilor Tseng said, and we need to know what went wrong specifically, and we need to know what will change specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2353.728s">tomorrow,</a>  next week, the week after that, so that our multiple elections next year will be airtight and that every resident that has felt a lack of confidence or disenfranchised by this process can know that our next elections are multiple, very consequential elections next year will be airtight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2371.999s">So</a>  I hope that the administration is listening and I hope that they will respond with the urgency that we feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2376.802s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2377.6s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2378.421s">I</a>  just want to make it very clear, I believe my fellow councilors have covered pretty much everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2383.429s">I</a>  do just want to note that elections are objectively more complicated these days. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2387.615s">There's</a>  early voting, there's permanent mail ballots, there's election day voting, and <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2392.977s">The</a>  council, I think, really under the request and advisement of our previous elections coordinator, moved to that commission format to streamline this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2401.064s">And</a>  unfortunately, as a result, that commission and that office, well, not the commission, but the office was understaffed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2406.828s">And</a>  this is something that council pointed out time and time again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2409.31s">We</a>  asked for that office to be staffed up, and it was not heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2412.613s">So</a>  we did one thing, and then we got a negative outcome from it, because the <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2418.143s">the</a>  mayor's end was not upheld essentially from our wishes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2421.125s">So</a>  again, I think just want to make both those things clear that there is a lot of moving pieces. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2425.648s">There</a>  are more moving pieces than there ever have been in our elections or local elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2430.151s">And</a>  we made a change that was asked for and we believe would absolutely streamline and make this process easier, but without the staffing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2437.094s">It</a>  doesn't work, so I appreciate Vice President Bears bringing that up, as well as the appropriation for that staffing that we've been asking for this whole time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2443.879s">So</a>  I'll go back to Vice President Bears, and then I know there's likely a lot of folks who want to speak on this, so I want to make sure we can open up the floor.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2450.563s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2452.945s">I'll</a>  be briefer, because you basically just made my point. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2455.535s">We</a>  voted in the spring of 2022 to adopt a piece of state law that modernized the system and moved us from the clerk and registrar voters to a formal elections commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2466.72s">The</a>  intent of this body was that we would have an elections department with a director that would be at least as well staffed as it was previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2474.143s">Under</a>  the clerk-registrar-voter system, you had the full-time clerk, three full-time staff in the elections office, as well as the full-time elections coordinator for much of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2484.568s">Then</a>  you also had the volunteer board of registrars. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2487.152s">That</a>  was an oversight body. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2488.974s">We</a>  moved to the Elections Commission and the budget came back. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2492.179s">We</a>  went from five, essentially five full-time staff, to two and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2496.862s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2497.282s">We</a>  went, we now have two full-time staff, one 20 hour a week, halftime person. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2501.264s">That</a>  position is not even filled because nobody wants it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2505.126s">It</a>  doesn't make sense to have a 20 hour a week position. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2508.067s">You</a>  had a ton of work of this election then fall on election commissioners who are not supposed to be running the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2514.75s">They're</a>  supposed to be certifying results, overseeing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2517.271s">They're</a>  not supposed to be in the nitty gritty. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2518.952s">I</a>  mean, the last people in the office were the elections manager and the elections commissioners and LHS, which is the service the state uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2526.312s">Why</a>  are the elections commissioners cleaning up this mess at the 11th hour? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2530.336s">That</a>  should be what the staff is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2531.917s">Staff,</a>  you should have me fully staffed, so you're never in that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2534.759s">The</a>  commission is an oversight authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2536.261s">They're</a>  not meant to be working. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2537.502s">And</a>  I just want to be working staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2539.844s">And</a>  basically, I just want to be really clear here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2543.589s">When</a>  you basically cut the staff in half and then you try to backfill with volunteers or poll workers or temporary workers, it's not gonna work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2552.114s">And</a>  we were very clear about that from the get-go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2555.255s">There's</a>  an election in 14 weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2556.876s">There's</a>  an election in March. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2558.197s">There</a>  are four elections between the one we just had, including the one we just had in next November. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2564.461s">As</a>  the president just said, elections are more complicated than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2568.103s">They're</a>  more frequent than ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2569.063s">They</a>  require more resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2571.171s">And</a>  instead, it seems that the choice was made that this was a place where we could find cuts and save money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2577.478s">Now,</a>  I think we all know my position that the city budget is massively underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2582.163s">I</a>  don't think the place you start finding money is in the elections department. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2585.887s">When</a>  the council explicitly voted to modernize and fund the department because elections are getting more complicated, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2591.483s">and</a>  requiring more staff time and requiring more attention, not less. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2595.624s">So</a>  even if we get accountability, even if there's changes of whatever kind, even if we get a report that says, here's all the things that we did wrong and we're gonna do them better next time, it's not gonna get fixed unless the department is fully funded, staffed and staffed competently. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2611.428s">And</a>  that needs to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2612.788s">So</a>  this council has been saying that the whole reason we tried to do this process was to get us there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2618.909s">We</a>  did what was within our authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2621.85s">to</a>  make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2623.111s">And</a>  then, as President Morell said, the follow up wasn't there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2626.974s">The</a>  actually funding and appropriating and implementing this modernization process fell flat. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2632.938s">And</a>  we're seeing the results this year, in addition to the November 2022 election, where there were some of the similar mistakes that we saw this year happened as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2640.683s">So,</a>  you know, all this council can do at this point is <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2645.106s">put</a>  forward resolutions, and then, as Councilor Scarpelli said earlier, approve the appropriations when they come down, because if they had come down, I'm sure we would have held a special meeting to approve anything to get the additional surge resources in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2657.354s">The</a>  call never came, and we don't have the authority to make appropriations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2661.016s">So</a>  that side of things needs to be addressed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2665.199s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2665.84s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2666.16s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2668.962s">Councilor</a>  Tsengng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2670.151s">just</a>  more, this is more of a detail, but I would like to see what, if there is a report that comes out of this, I would like to see analysis of the low staffing levels, the funding problem, very specific about those questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2685.318s">I</a>  would also like to see, I believe that we had talked about, or the mayor's administration has decided that we would rely on some seasonal <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2695.832s">more</a>  seasonal employment of employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2698.894s">And</a>  we talked at length back then when we were reviewing the budget about how we needed full-time staff for that department. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2708.339s">And</a>  I'd like to see reference to that in the report.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2711.601s">Would</a>  you like that as an amendment?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2712.842s">Yes,</a>  please.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2713.642s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2714.963s">Any</a>  other further discussion?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2718.784s">I</a>  think we are at the point where everybody really expressed the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2723.426s">So</a>  I think the governing body in the state needs to get involved, and I think that this council should send a letter to the Secretary of State's office, to Galvin's office, so I'd make that a formal motion that we craft a letter, send it to the Secretary of State's office, and ask them to look into this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2744.885s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2747.227s">And</a>  just if I can, Madam President, I don't want people to understand that when we heard all these issues, the poll workers that are there are maybe mostly the sweetest people in the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2762.117s">They're</a>  doing something that's thankless, truly is thankless. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2766.1s">But</a>  one thing that was resounding throughout that day is how they weren't trained properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2773.373s">They</a>  didn't know what was right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2776.255s">And</a>  the sweetest woman that I love dearly, when I went to vote, she looked at me and she said, the first three letters of your name. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2783.56s">And</a>  I said, no, that's not how it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2787.717s">But</a>  these are the issues that went on everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2790.598s">We</a>  had one poll watcher that was put 25 feet away in the corner, was presented the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2797.561s">She</a>  was then moved by the warden behind eight feet away in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2802.202s">And</a>  then our elections commissioner came in and said, get out, go back to where you were. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2808.925s">That's</a>  not the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2811.385s">So</a>  it was the arrogance as well, because you have people that volunteered. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2816.123s">and</a>  as part of this process, which this is what we want in our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2820.044s">We</a>  want fair and open involved processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2823.085s">So,</a>  and again, I think that letter that we draft helps with the healing and the understand that we can move on and understand that we have something in place, Madam President, for especially November, that we feel safe and confident in our processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2839.848s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2840.208s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2844.467s">Seeing</a>  none, if there's any members of the public who would like to speak, feel free to come up to the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2848.848s">Who</a>  wants to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2858.091s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please, and just push the button on the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2862.852s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2863.172s">You're</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2864.953s">I'm</a>  good.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2865.793s">Yep,</a>  you're all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2866.773s">Oh,</a>  yeah, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2867.533s">I</a>  know you can't see the light. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2868.413s">We</a>  can see it, though.</p>

    <p>[Vepetto]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2870.534s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2871.294s">And</a>  just name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2873.315s">Michelle</a>  Vepetto. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2875.137s">29</a>  Daniel Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2877.038s">I'm</a>  a lifelong resident of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2880.678s">So</a>  I was at the senior center from 6.50 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2884.319s">to</a>  2.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2886.4s">The</a>  warden was immediately angry with me when I gave her my sheet and told her that I was an observer for the Caraviello campaign. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2896.402s">She</a>  called someone on the phone and I was treated terribly all day. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2902.724s">During</a>  this time, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2904.933s">there,</a>  I witnessed at 10.50, there was an elderly woman who came in a wheelchair and asked for assistance in filling out her ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2916.898s">The</a>  woman stood next to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2919.619s">She</a>  said she would read the names and then check off for her. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2926.723s">What</a>  she said was, for mayor, do you wanna vote for the incumbent? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2933.567s">The</a>  elderly lady was a little confused, and she looked at her, and then she said, oh yes, the incumbent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2942.53s">The</a>  warden read off the city council then, and she read, Beers, Collins, Tang, Callahan, Lazzaro, Leming, Roth. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2958.756s">After</a>  each name, the warden said, should I check that one? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2964.047s">At</a>  the end, I heard the voter ask, who else is there? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2969.952s">The</a>  warden said, you already voted for seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2973.995s">You</a>  can't vote for anyone anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2977.798s">She</a>  did not mention any of the other names. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2982.001s">The</a>  warden said, okay, now school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2985.684s">The</a>  voter asked, no, I don't know anyone on the school committee <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2992.133s">So</a>  the warden replied, are you all done then? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2995.675s">The</a>  woman said, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=2998.977s">There</a>  were voters that came in and were told that they were at the wrong polling place. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3005.08s">Most</a>  of those, they were told that they were supposed to be at the Brooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3010.063s">Some</a>  was told they could cast their vote, but not put it in the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3014.585s">It</a>  was put in a stack of others in a big manila envelope. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3024.042s">except</a>  one person went around and put it in the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3030.146s">The</a>  others were directed to where they were supposed to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3034.989s">At</a>  9 a.m., a woman who asked to cast her vote was told no. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3042.114s">She</a>  said she had to go to the book school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3045.076s">The</a>  voter said that I can't get there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3048.486s">They</a>  called Melissa, who spoke to the voter on the phone, and she told her that she couldn't vote at the senior center. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3058.851s">There</a>  were about 15 voters that came in and were told that they were inactive and were asked for an ID, or some produced a picture ID with their address, driver's license, and others produced a credit card, passport with just a name. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3075.685s">There</a>  were voters that did not have an ID and they let them vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3080.167s">They</a>  voted and those ballots were again put in a manila envelope and not in the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3089.431s">I</a>  noted the name of a voter, Nancy Batari Batari from Riverside Ave, who came in very upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3100.282s">She</a>  had a mail-in ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3102.306s">She</a>  said she never requested a mail-in ballot, always votes in person, and she wanted to vote in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3113.578s">as</a>  she always does. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3115.479s">They</a>  told her to open the envelope, and they were rude to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3121.283s">She</a>  showed them it was blank, and they told her to fill it out and give it to the warden. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3126.966s">The</a>  voter filled it out, went right over and put it in the machine, and the workers were all standing in front of her, preventing her from putting it in the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3137.592s">And</a>  she went around them, and she put her vote right in the machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3147.565s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3150.246s">So</a>  the warden had a mnemonic envelope and she kept putting the ballots in and they were not individually labeled. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3158.908s">And</a>  then she kept on putting it behind her or behind her on a chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3163.149s">This</a>  council should be very upset at the poor caddy behavior of the warden, the election workers and Melissa. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3170.811s">Upon</a>  arrival, the warden told me that I was not allowed anywhere near the registration table. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3176.293s">I</a>  could only stand and I could not use one of the hundred vacant chairs to sit in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3181.834s">I</a>  was shocked and I am a disabled taxpaying property owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3187.916s">And</a>  I was standing in a building owned by taxpayers being told I could not sit in a chair that I, a taxpayer, paid for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3196.818s">Melissa</a>  arrived gruffly and told me that I could only stand in the corner and that I could not use a chair, table, wall, outlets, amenities. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3206.293s">She</a>  called the officer over to stand next to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3209.676s">The</a>  registration ladies were checking in voters by last name. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3213.38s">They</a>  weren't calling the last name or the street address. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3218.085s">When</a>  I asked them to, I was ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3223.513s">When</a>  Miss Knight arrived, I asked to be closer to hear and asked if they were supposed to be calling out the names and addresses so I could hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3233.48s">Adam</a>  told me yes and spoke to the warden and told her the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3237.442s">She</a>  got back on the phone again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3239.443s">After</a>  Adam left, she told me to move even further away, 30 feet from the registration table, and I could barely hear at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3249.878s">One</a>  of the attorneys for the cabiano campaign arrived told the warden. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3254.806s">who</a>  they were and moved me closer so I could observe and hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3259.048s">After</a>  that attorney left, Melissa arrived at 1130, she reprimanded me loudly, and she said she didn't care what Adam or the attorney or anyone else said, that those were her rules and that they were all wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3273.833s">The</a>  workers, the wardens, and the wardens were passing notes to each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3278.214s">Melissa</a>  came back. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3280.197s">with</a>  a male and female officer told me that if I didn't comply to escort me out the building, I was shaken, I was embarrassed, I was unjustly bullied. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3291.479s">Melissa</a>  moved the table in front of me and put lunch boxes so I couldn't even see the registration machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3298.68s">So</a>  I am just asking as a taxpayer, I'm asking for a full recount to the vote to restore my faith in the integrity of the voting.</p>

I'm not going to say the word. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3350.249s">And</a>  so, especially the mayoral election, it was pretty damn close. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3357.473s">With</a>  all these mistakes, this could easily have gone differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3362.548s">I</a>  say let's have a fricking mayoral election. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3365.569s">This</a>  isn't right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3366.269s">This</a>  needs to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3367.969s">And</a>  not just talking either. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3369.57s">It</a>  needs to be like what Mr. Scarpelli said, they need to come up with a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3375.371s">But</a>  then we need to have like dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3376.912s">You're</a>  gonna finish this by then. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3378.172s">You're</a>  gonna do this by then. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3379.452s">And</a>  someone needs to be fired, honestly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3381.753s">Because</a>  they didn't do their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3384.373s">And</a>  election integrity doesn't exist in Medford, period. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3388.374s">We</a>  need to fix that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3389.735s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie Tringali]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3939.156s">Hi,</a>  Melanie Trongali, 116 Forest Street and a recent candidate for the 2023 election. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3947.043s">And</a>  just sitting here, a couple of things that really stuck out at me is that there was listed probably 10 to 15 issues with the election from beginning to end. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3960.015s">4,000</a>  ballots, if I heard George right, were not counted, were not counted in public, or don't know how they were counted. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3967.52s">You</a>  all said that there was a complicated process, more complicated process because of the early voting and the mail-in ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3974.885s">And</a>  each one of you said that election integrity was an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3979.829s">And</a>  given all those issues, how can you sit here and say 100% that the end result <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3986.348s">will</a>  not be impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3987.909s">I've</a>  been in business for 20 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3990.471s">And</a>  whenever there is a breakdown in process, there is usually an impact on the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=3997.717s">Now,</a>  I'm not saying that those changes are going to be huge to make a difference in who won and who didn't win. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4002.941s">But</a>  there should be absolute 100% proof that what happened or the counts were accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4012.528s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4013.829s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4019.938s">Eileen,</a>  let's try this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4020.958s">It</a>  looks like I got kicked out of Zoom, so it looks like our connection's bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4024.219s">I</a>  keep looking a little frozen, so I don't have a lot of... Can you hear me now? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4029.101s">I</a>  can hear you, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4030.841s">It</a>  might help to... Okay.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4033.462s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4034.683s">So,</a>  I think it's a pleasure for once since I've lived in Medford that, you know, many people <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4043.543s">feel</a>  the same way, that we're not divided. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4045.744s">We</a>  want to see a fair and free and safe and accessible election. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4053.088s">Everybody</a>  wants to see that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4055.33s">And</a>  there were some issues <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4058.123s">It</a>  doesn't seem like the people who are in the know think those issues were grave enough to hold another election. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4066.067s">And</a>  really, if we could afford another election, we probably would have enough money to have had a better result with the election to begin with, because it seems like all the problems go back to what all the problems are. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4081.716s">With</a>  the school committee, with everything, we don't have enough money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4086.514s">And,</a>  and even the mayor can't manufacture money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4090.179s">I</a>  mean, we have to get the money some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4093.885s">And</a>  that's the issue that needs to be resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4096.529s">I</a>  don't think, you know, people are fallible, they make mistakes, but <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4101.937s">How</a>  could you not make a mistake when you're so understaffed and you have such a monumental job to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4109.859s">I</a>  mean, I feel sorry for the people that had to do all this work, you know, and didn't have enough help. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4119.021s">How</a>  is that possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4120.022s">It's</a>  not possible for the two people to do that job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4123.743s">So</a>  it was inevitable that issues would arise. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4128.024s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4129.224s">You</a>  know, we have to have a staff that can do the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4133.107s">If</a>  we have a staff that can do the job, we have to have money. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4136.809s">The</a>  whole problem, the way I see it, is not so much integrity, because I feel like all the people that were involved <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4145.315s">have</a>  integrity and they tried to do the best they could and and it got messed up and yeah the city council and the people that live here we got to demand a better result but we also got to get the money to have a better result because i don't know how anything can change without more money thank you thank you can we just get your address for the record oh nine adams circle</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4651.847s">Yes,</a>  sorry, that was a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4652.608s">Yeah,</a>  that was a letter to be sent to the Secretary of State, and then Councilor Tseng further amended to ask for specific details related to funding and staffing related to the challenges. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4661.053s">And</a>  that's what was voted on and approved 6-0-1 absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4666.256s">But</a>  a motion from</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4669.4s">Councilor,</a>  I believe it was Councilor Tseng to revert with a second by Vice Mayor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4870.122s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4871.603s">Alicia</a>  Hunt, Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability for the City. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4875.345s">I'm</a>  here tonight with Senior Planner Danielle Evans. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4879.287s">So</a>  this is a method that is relatively new, but it's gone through the City Council once before about how we change zoning for a specific planned development district for a specific location when presented with a project that <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4894.243s">make</a>  sense to the city, make sense within our plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4900.747s">So</a>  we've submitted from the CD board actually a memo that talks about the various climate action and adaptation plan, comprehensive plan, the housing, sorry, production plan, and how this, that they considered all of those in their recommendation that this fits with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4922.021s">At</a>  this time, this is, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4924.412s">had</a>  its original referral from this board, which was a required referral to the CD board for recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4931.177s">CD</a>  board conducted a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4933.499s">You</a>  have a memo that senior planner, Daniel Evans drafted for you about the recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4938.862s">And</a>  she's here if you wanted her to speak to that or to more detail about what the community development board discussed at that meeting, or I can as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4948.749s">At</a>  this time, if you were to approve this, this would be for the zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4954.062s">The</a>  next step would be that the housing, sorry, the housing authority, I apologize, you had a long meeting, but I sat in a three-hour traffic commission meeting immediately before this, so my brain is also catching up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4969.028s">So</a>  the housing authority would still need to apply for a special permit for the construction of these projects, and during that time would go through <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4979.083s">a</a>  site plan review process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4981.284s">So</a>  I will point out that there are a number of concerns around things like traffic, circulation, and trees, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4989.468s">Those</a>  are items that are addressed during site plan review and would be thoroughly vetted at that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=4994.471s">I'm</a>  not saying you shouldn't or can't consider those, but this is really about the height, the density, this is about the zoning of this, and those details like zoning does not really address trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5007.043s">but</a>  site plan review does and access. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5011.046s">So</a>  that's where we stand with this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5013.008s">There</a>  are a number of members of the housing authority team here tonight to speak to you about this, unless you have any other questions about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5020.874s">And</a>  Danielle and I are here both to speak to the process and to the city board's considerations during their public meeting.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5028.299s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5029.4s">Are</a>  there any questions from councilors at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5032.618s">I</a>  think just, I'm going to describe really just quickly, just so we, I think just cause this is a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5038.322s">So</a>  we have to run a specific way. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5039.443s">I</a>  think we'll take questions from Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5041.024s">If</a>  we haven't this time, we'll go to the petitioner, any additional questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5044.866s">Then</a>  we open up the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5046.327s">I</a>  know there's lots of folks who want to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5048.089s">That</a>  is the time to speak either in favor and opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5051.371s">I</a>  know sometimes there is some nuance in between, but pick a time so we can, we can lodge your comments and then we will, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5060.971s">see</a>  if we have a motion for a vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5062.172s">So</a>  just so folks know the process we're gonna go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5065.313s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, do you have a question for right now?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5068.055s">Yeah,</a>  I think the biggest concern that I have is, as we're talking, as we're seeing some of the new changes we're seeing and some of the development that we're seeing, one constant comes back to me from neighbors and residents that they shared what I felt was an issue was that <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5089.513s">As</a>  we're moving forward with these zoning changes, we see that they're important. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5092.314s">We</a>  see that they can be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5094.415s">What</a>  we don't have, though, is proper notification when we do certain jobs in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5102.379s">I</a>  don't think we do a very good job informing our constituents of projects that are coming about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5108.042s">I'll</a>  use Mystic Ave as an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5112.964s">That</a>  evening, we talked about a building that sounds great, but I posed it for the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5120.497s">it</a>  right now, it's a unicorn, and I didn't get any answer from the administration of what the vision is for that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5128.718s">No</a>  different than what's happening over at the old KISS 108 site at the T building in Wellington, that the building's being razed and we still have no vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5138.86s">Now,</a>  that's very close to having two gateways of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5144.061s">And</a>  I think that moving forward with any more zoning is, to me, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5150.577s">is</a>  a slippery slope to the fact that we're not letting our constituents know. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5154.899s">There</a>  are some projects that organizations, I'll give you an example with our housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5162.283s">There</a>  have been multiple meetings, multiple neighbors, opportunities for people to speak on different projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5173.569s">I</a>  don't think we see that too often. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5176.457s">when</a>  it comes to some of these positions and some of these projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5181.64s">And</a>  I tell you, I think when we talked about putting together the zoning study and having that bring that team in that will go neighborhood to neighborhood, remember we talked about that and getting the idea of the residents of what people want Medford to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5198.047s">It</a>  seems like we forgot that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5199.968s">We're</a>  not doing that anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5201.829s">That's</a>  been put in the back burner. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5203.75s">Well,</a>  we haven't done anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5206.072s">We're</a>  coming up with new zoning changes and we're saying, well, we could do this now because this might work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5214.037s">But</a>  in totality, we still don't have a plan and we still aren't including all of our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5220.741s">So,</a>  and I think that's a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5222.882s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5225.904s">Do</a>  you want to speak to the notification for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5229.328s">I</a>  don't want to misspeak. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5231.551s">So</a>  there's a notification process for public hearings, but I don't want to misspeak to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5235.776s">Do</a>  you know?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5238.859s">Well,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5240.061s">I'm</a>  Danielle Evans, senior planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5242.884s">Are</a>  you talking about the notification for the project in general or? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5246.64s">for</a>  the rezoning?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5247.861s">I</a>  think for any projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5250.602s">I</a>  mean, for anything that's going on in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5252.463s">I've</a>  been getting phone calls, I get 45 phone calls, it's something we're gonna talk about later.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5256.384s">So</a>  I think that- So this actual, this project's been, when the CPC and then when you're on real body approved the funding for CPA funds, one of the conditions that the CPC placed on it is that there be a very robust public input process <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5276.295s">and</a>  they built that into their budget for multiple, multiple meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5283.299s">I</a>  went to several of them on my own time in the evening just to see what was going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5287.761s">They</a>  had some for residents, some for the butters. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5292.204s">Gabe</a>  could speak to how many there were. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5294.965s">I</a>  didn't make it to all of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5298.067s">But</a>  for that, there were many, many meetings.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5300.468s">We</a>  didn't do mailings for this one, for this site plan.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5304.609s">Yeah,</a>  for site plan review and for the special permit is when all of the butters are noticed, but for zoning change, it's, you know, two ads run the paper, you post the public hearing notice, and it goes to, there's a list of different bodies that it goes to.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5322.969s">I</a>  might add, there are a lot of people who have been to public meetings of this and who are here this evening to speak on this, so in my impression, they must have heard about this, so the public notification must be working because people know about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5338.122s">Every</a>  time they call you upset about something we're doing, it actually indicates that they know about it, so.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5345.815s">And</a>  what I'll do is I'll ask, what I'll do is I'll ask a request because I think what's getting out, because if you ask, there's a demographic that if you look at all the surveys and there's a demographic that gets the information and it seems to be one demographic, there's a lot of people, if you ask the common person in this room that's not involved with this, they've never heard anything about this because the message is getting out to the people that it seems like that are pinpointed to <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5374.714s">direct</a>  mailers or groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5380.696s">So</a>  that's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5383.796s">When</a>  I say this project, I'm saying as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5387.377s">I'm</a>  having calls from as a whole when we're talking about different surveys and things being done around the community and your office getting back to people and saying, oh no, we sent it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5399.701s">And</a>  there are times that I'm in those same neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5402.361s">I</a>  didn't get anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5403.102s">I'm</a>  a city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5404.522s">So</a>  that I can't, I can't not listen or bring forth what my constituents are bringing to me.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5411.988s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5412.409s">And</a>  anytime any of your constituents have suggestions about better ways that we can notify short of us knocking on everybody's door. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5419.655s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5420.515s">I,</a>  we are very open to where else can, how else can we put the word about these? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5425.94s">Where</a>  else can we, and I will mention that <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5428.893s">Paper</a>  mailing the entire city costs about $18,000.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5431.235s">So</a>  let's talk about what we talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5434.978s">Something</a>  that we were very excited about is hiring that zoning team and then bringing our vision of our development, our growth in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5444.466s">Remember,</a>  going neighborhood to neighborhood, involving everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5450.871s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5451.531s">Having</a>  community meetings.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5452.812s">We</a>  can't afford that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5454.132s">We</a>  can't afford that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5455.492s">I</a>  know you would really like us to do it that way, but we're going to have to have more than $100,000 to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5461.274s">That's</a>  very expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5465.995s">We</a>  requested it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5467.755s">This</a>  council requested it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5470.236s">It's</a>  not us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5471.156s">This</a>  council has requested it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5473.197s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5474.777s">At</a>  this point, we want to go to the petitioner, unless there's any other <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5481.593s">Gabriel,</a>  you're going to have to talk.</p>

    <p>[Ciccariello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5508.487s">Madam</a>  President, City Councilors, I have a presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5512.988s">I'm</a>  Gabe Ciccarello. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5517.289s">I'm</a>  the Director of Modernization and Procurement with the Medford Housing Authority, and I'm here to present the redevelopment of Guam Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5530.265s">Can</a>  I be able to share?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5532.386s">Yeah,</a>  can you make Gabe, I assume it's your teacher, Garello? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5537.147s">That's</a>  you?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5537.767s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5538.327s">The</a>  co-host.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5550.151s">Should</a>  have it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5551.011s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ciccariello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5559.67s">One</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5575.638s">Let's</a>  see the screen now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5580.18s">So</a>  we have a very deep, dedicated, mission-driven team here with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5588.295s">Jeff</a>  Driscoll is our executive director. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5590.936s">We</a>  are using the Cambridge Housing Authority as a development consultant and also an owner's project manager when we come to construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5601.782s">Our</a>  counsel is Nolan Sheehan-Patton, and Hannah Kilson is here with me tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5606.525s">She's</a>  going to assist me as we get further into the presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5610.247s">Our</a>  architect is Dietz and Company, and Danny Gerpal-Attisha is here representing Dietz. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5616.884s">And</a>  our civil engineer is Faustin O'Neill. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5619.167s">They</a>  are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5620.188s">And</a>  our traffic engineer, who performed the traffic study, is Mitch Engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5625.934s">So</a>  through this presentation, I'm just going to give you a brief overview of the walking court development. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5631.661s">Then</a>  I'm going to turn it over to Hannah to discuss the PDD process and our requesting zoning amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5638.447s">So,</a>  Whatling Court is currently, it's 144 units of state-aided public housing for low-income seniors and disabled households. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5648.651s">All</a>  the units are deeply affordable with our residents' rents calculated 30% of their income. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5656.053s">Historically</a>  and to date, Whatling Court has not received sufficient operating substate to address its physical needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5663.686s">It</a>  was built in 1963 and suffers from two key deficiencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5669.027s">There's</a>  some pictures to the right of just your typical existing conditions within the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5674.788s">And</a>  one of the biggest things is that it lacks accessibility features for seniors and disabled households as they're two-story walk-up garden flat style buildings with no elevators. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5685.991s">So</a>  half of our senior disabled residents need to access stairs to get to their units. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5693.153s">This</a>  is a bird's eye view of the Walkman Court development. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5696.877s">As</a>  you can see, it's bordered and adjacent to some interesting properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5702.282s">To</a>  the west, it's a commercial site with Whole Foods and Starbucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5707.747s">To</a>  the south, we have kind of a more industrial commercial space with Elizabeth Grady, their mid-rise style buildings, commercial office space and lab space. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5717.912s">To</a>  the north, there's a couple of residential homes, and then the Mystic River Reservation amenity. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5723.857s">And</a>  to the east is your typical Medford two-family and single-family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5730.963s">To</a>  the top right here, this is a picture to the entrance of Walkman Court from Auburn Street, looking down towards the Auburn North Street intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5742.529s">This</a>  next picture to the bottom is from the North Street Bridge looking west. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5748.374s">You</a>  can see across the train tracks, there's a mid-rise commercial type buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5753.378s">And</a>  to the right, you can see our two-story walk-up garden flat buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5758.802s">And</a>  to the top left is to the west of our property that shows the Whole Foods building, the Whole Foods parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5767.521s">The</a>  picture to the right here is what the proposed redevelopment we hope to look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5772.486s">And</a>  this is an elevated view from around the intersection of North Street and Auburn Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5780.833s">We're</a>  proposing five structures on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5784.95s">Three</a>  of them to the north of the site and east of the site are two-story townhouse buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5793.076s">To</a>  the west of the site, we're proposing a four-story family mid-rise building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5797.939s">Three</a>  of those stories would be residential, and the ground floor would be podium parking and a couple common area spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5806.849s">And</a>  then scaling up towards the south of the site where the adjacency is mid-rise buildings, we're looking to put a six-story elderly disabled elevator building with podium parking on the first floor and then five stories of residential units. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5824.207s">So</a>  the goals of the redevelopment is, number one, is to provide high quality, accessible, and deeply affordable units to our existing 144 units that are on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5835.05s">But</a>  we're also looking to build 94 net new, deeply affordable units within that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5842.653s">And</a>  54 of those would be elderly disabled units, and 40 of those would be family units. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5850.391s">We're</a>  looking to improve the resiliency and sustainability to this site, and then improve the site's connection to the surrounding neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5857.694s">This</a>  site is existing, has a decent connection to the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5861.375s">It's</a>  used a lot as a walkthrough for people coming from Boston Ave to connect to Whole Foods, and we are looking to improve upon that with this new design. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5870.719s">And</a>  the redevelopment of Walking Foot is a local priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5873.94s">So</a>  the replacement of the 144 units and construction of new units <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5878.804s">is</a>  included in the fiscal year 21 through 25 city of Medford's housing production plan as a strategy to help meet the city's housing goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5888.388s">And</a>  again, all units during the redevelopment after development would remain deeply affordable with residents' rents limited to 30% of their income. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5900.834s">To</a>  the left here is just the, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5903.667s">sketch</a>  of the site plan showing the senior mid-rise building is a larger building A, then there's the smaller mid-rise family buildings, building B, and then the three townhouse buildings, which would be C, D, and E. And to the right here, the top right picture is a rendering of what the proposed dedicated senior outdoor space would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5926.712s">They</a>  currently at Walkling Court have a really nice community garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5929.953s">We</a>  look to incorporate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5931.993s">is</a>  have a really nice dedicated senior space. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5934.656s">And</a>  the bottom picture to the right is what the site would look like coming in off of Auburn Street and during Walkland Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5942.005s">So</a>  to the east, you have the townhouse type buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5946.37s">To</a>  the west, you'd have the family mid-rise. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5949.553s">And</a>  straight down to the south would be the senior mid-rise building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5955.636s">So</a>  an overview of what we've done during the resident and neighborhood engagement process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5961.198s">So</a>  we've had a very active and well-attended resident and neighborhood engagement process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5967.18s">At</a>  the time of submitting this PDV application, we've held seven resident meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5972.522s">We</a>  held five full community meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5975.903s">Before</a>  we started the full community process, we also held a meeting with the Director Butters to Walkman Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=5983.453s">This</a>  is just a map of what the legal notifications in the yellow, we were legally had to mail out notifications within 400 feet, but we also flyered for every meeting within that area and we went past that area out to West Street, Lyman Ave and Boston Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6001.803s">We</a>  also posted notices within and around the walk-in court site. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6007.922s">The</a>  MHA has met with a variety of city departments, almost all city departments now, including the fire department, building department, and DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6017.209s">And</a>  we've also had the public meetings for the Community Preservation Act funding that we've submitted for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6026.236s">During</a>  the resident and community engagement process, some of the key topics that came up were density and height and increasing <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6038.038s">I'm</a>  just gonna block this, I can't see this real quick, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6042.639s">Increasing</a>  the number of affordable housing at Whatcom Court, again, as identified as a strategy in the city's fiscal year 21 through 25 housing production plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6053.041s">And</a>  the 94 net new units is expected to increase the number of actual residents on site by about 101%, not the number of units, but the number of residents on site by about 101%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6065.891s">And</a>  the senior mid-rise, again, is a five-story building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6068.713s">Senior</a>  mid-rise, five stories, living space, and then the covered podium parking on the ground floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6077.499s">A</a>  key goal of this project, again, is to provide elevated access to seniors and disabled residents, and also families in the mid-rise building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6085.965s">There</a>  is a high need for handicap-assessable family housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6091.303s">And</a>  we're trying to work efficient building footprints with the height to allow for more programmable interior space and more kind of accessible, usable open space on the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6102.907s">And</a>  again, the building types reflect, we try to reflect the adjacency around the site to the proximity and adjacency to the buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6115.212s">One</a>  of the questions that has come up is the proximity to the trains. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6119.418s">to</a>  the commuter rail line. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6120.999s">And</a>  the site and facade is designed to meet HUD noise requirements using high-performance windows and insulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6127.163s">We've</a>  onboarded an acoustical engineer that will stay on the project team during design development, during construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6134.448s">And</a>  actually, the noise on this site currently will be greatly improved from its current situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6141.692s">And</a>  all the new buildings will have mechanical ventilation installed and have centralized heating and cooling. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6150.198s">And</a>  there's many examples of comparable development going on adjacent to railroad tracks, especially with market rate housing, mid-rise buildings being built along Boston Avenue and Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6164.468s">There's</a>  been a question about having an access road through the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6167.45s">We're</a>  looking, right now there's two entry points to get into. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6171.013s">There's</a>  two separate entry points to get into Walkman Court, and we're looking to make it through street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6176.677s">And</a>  that access road would provide residents and visitors access to all of the buildings within the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6183.562s">It</a>  would ensure emergency access, and it's been reviewed and recommended by the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6189.557s">And</a>  of course, it would be designed to ensure pedestrian safety with traffic calming measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6194.459s">And</a>  the parking that we have planned is based on usage for low-income seniors and families, and the parking need will be met on site. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6204.122s">Residents</a>  living within the walkway development not have to go and park outside of the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6211.765s">We've</a>  had the traffic survey done by Niche Engineering. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6215.386s">It's</a>  determined that no traffic mitigation measures will be warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6219.957s">And</a>  then environmental issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6221.238s">We've</a>  conducted a phase one and phase two environmental site assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6226.4s">Any</a>  asbestos remediation and soil removal would meet state and federal requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6231.663s">And</a>  all construction activities will be monitored to ensure that hazardous materials are properly handled. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6237.446s">And</a>  no environmental impact statement is required because no Mass Environmental Protection Act thresholds have been exceeded or are exceeded. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6245.591s">Now</a>  I'm gonna turn it over to Hannah.</p>

    <p>[Kilson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6252.808s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6253.489s">My</a>  name is Hannah Kilson. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6255.59s">I'm</a>  a partner at the law firm of Nolan Sheehan Patent, 84 State Street in Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6261.033s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President and Councilors this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6264.936s">I</a>  want to walk through with you the proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6270.839s">What</a>  is being proposed this evening by Medford Housing Authority is to adopt what we are calling the PDD 3 amendment, which would create <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6280.699s">a</a>  planned residential development district within Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6287.625s">Gabe,</a>  I'm going to let you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6291.508s">So</a>  Gabe had, if you can go back. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6293.17s">So</a>  the first one, just talk about this planned development district would require an amendment of the zoning map. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6300.456s">And</a>  it would require an amendment of the zoning map <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6303.387s">to</a>  situate this parcel, as we noted. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6306.849s">The</a>  southeast portion of this parcel is bordered by North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6311.591s">The</a>  south portion of the parcel is bordered by an industrial district, which on across the railroad tracks sits the Tufts Engineering Education and Outreach Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6325.857s">To</a>  the west of the parcel will sit <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6329.867s">the</a>  commercial district, which is currently occupied by Whole Foods Market, and then towards the north and the northeast is an apartment one district, which as was noted, has single family homes and two family homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6342.918s">And</a>  so the first portion is to amend the zoning map to allow a PDD three district in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6349.663s">The</a>  zoning amendment under the PDD three contains certain general provisions that relate to <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6357.605s">special</a>  permit process, the site plan process, which will occur through the Community Development Board and then the special permit granting authorities, this council here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6368.299s">We</a>  are also proposing that the special permit that we would obtain through this council would also be sufficient <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6376.847s">to</a>  qualify for the inclusionary housing provision special permit that's currently required under the zoning ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6387.518s">The</a>  permitted uses for the project, you can see here up on the screen, this site will only have two types of permitted uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6398.432s">One</a>  will be residential uses, and the other will be general office uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6402.758s">The</a>  proposed amendment would make the uses as of right detached family dwellings, attached single family dwellings, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6412.014s">detached</a>  two family dwellings, and multiple dwelling class A, multiple dwelling class B, and senior housing independent living. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6420.718s">Those</a>  uses would be permitted as of right, whereas a special permit would be required from this city council for dormitory, lodging, boarding houses, and for any other type of senior facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6434.843s">Right</a>  now on the site, as we noted, this site has been developed since 1963 <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6441.797s">multifamily</a>  housing with nine buildings on the site, but the multiple dwelling houses greater than at 75 or six stories is not permitted as of right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6453.704s">And</a>  so that is one element of use that is needed in order for the development that's being proposed for Medford Housing Authority to be available. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6463.43s">The</a>  next component of the proposed amendment is dimensional. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6469.493s">So</a>  the proposed amendment would allow for more than one principal structure on the site, similar to what exists currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6477.398s">It</a>  would provide that each of those structures on the site would have to be located at least 15 feet from another principal structure, which is similar to the current requirement under the existing zoning code. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6491.526s">The</a>  dimensional standards that we're proposing here for this PDD are really consistent with what we think is both the intent of the PDD, which is to allow kind of flexibility for redevelopment of the Walkleen Court site in order to achieve a goal that clearly <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6509.179s">city</a>  has articulated in a number of its planning documents, which is to create more affordable housing, both for senior and disabled residents of Medford, but also for families. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6521.129s">So</a>  the lot configuration that we would propose here for any lot that's located in <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6528.055s">the</a>  PDD 3, it would have minimum frontage of 35 feet, it would have minimum lot width of 35 feet, and it would have a minimum lot depth of 75 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6540.449s">The</a>  minimum lot area would be 10,000 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6544.753s">and</a>  we would allow for a dwelling unit density of one unit per 750 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6550.897s">So</a>  that expresses that we are looking to create a development density to achieve the objectives of more affordable housing available in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6562.585s">Maximum</a>  lot coverage, sorry, I can't see the screen from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6566.207s">My</a>  eyesight's not good enough to follow that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6569.129s">The</a>  maximum lot coverage is 35%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6572.748s">Under</a>  current zoning, it's 30%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6575.83s">Landscape</a>  and usable open space, we are proposing in our amendment that that be 10% of the gross floor area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6584.233s">This</a>  space requirement would allow development density, again, that we think is consistent with the City of Medford's plan for this site and would enable us to build, help the City of Medford achieve its goal of 600 affordable housing units in fiscal year 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6601.889s">If</a>  the proposed redevelopment of Lockwood Court was allowed by special permit, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6609.533s">The</a>  open space that we're proposing is, in fact, more accessible and more usable than the existing open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6616.099s">Currently,</a>  the landscaped open space here is 10%, and the current requirement for usable open space is 25%. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6623.326s">Setbacks,</a>  the setbacks that we are proposing <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6629.306s">on</a>  the site is front yard of 15 feet, side yard of 10 feet, and rear yard of 15 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6639.091s">Given</a>  the typography, however, on North Street, the PDD amendment actually requires no setback for the parking spaces located in the front yard of any lot in the PDD 3 district. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6652.538s">And</a>  that is consistent with the current circumstances of parking at the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6658.128s">Maximum</a>  height and stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6660.31s">In</a>  this PDD-3, the maximum height and stories really is dependent on the residential use. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6667.276s">Here,</a>  where our intentions are multifamily and single-family attached, the maximum height would be 75 feet for multiple family housing in six stories, or it would be 35 feet in three stories for attached single-family dwellings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6688.281s">Next</a>  would be our parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6689.682s">The</a>  parking here, the ratio of parking would be one parking space for every two units, which is a parking space ratio that the underlying zoning currently would permit at the site for affordable housing use development. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6708.609s">That's,</a>  I think that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6710.65s">And</a>  so I think with that, I guess the last thing to mention, maybe it's a less substantive provision, but is the PDD amendment allows for screening of mechanical equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6721.233s">And</a>  we always recognize that that is a concern to minimize the visibility of mechanical equipment on site and from the streets and from neighboring parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6730.816s">So</a>  one of the requirements for the project under the PDD is to make sure there's adequate screening <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6737.748s">such</a>  mechanical equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6739.89s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6740.891s">I'm</a>  here to answer any questions that you might have about the amendment, but this concludes my presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6745.976s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6746.337s">Thank</a>  you, Attorney Gilson.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6758.37s">Councilor</a>  Garabello, do you have questions for you? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6760.371s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6761.912s">So</a>  as this is a public hearing, we do have to open up the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6766.035s">So</a>  I'm going to open up, call for people who want to speak in favor of the position before us, the zoning change before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6772.48s">And</a>  then I will call for people who want to speak in opposition of the zoning change before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6777.663s">lost</a>  my train of thought on something else.</p>

    <p>[Ciccariello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6779.924s">Should</a>  I start sharing now? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6781.244s">Yeah,</a>  that would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6783.125s">Oh,</a>  what I wanted to say is also there's been a number of folks that also submitted their opinion by email that the clerk will add to the report as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6790.728s">So</a>  as this is a public hearing, if there is anyone who would like to speak in favor of the paper before us, this is the zoning change before us that the MHA just presented on, please come up to the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6801.812s">You</a>  can literally just say yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6803.312s">You</a>  can say a little bit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6807.73s">Just</a>  name and address for the record, please, as you come up.</p>

    <p>[Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6810.591s">Roberta</a>  Cameron, 12 North Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6813.993s">And</a>  yes, I'm in favor of this development. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6816.954s">And</a>  if I may say a little bit more, I am a member of the Community Preservation Committee, and we very strongly supported this development because we feel that it is really critical for improving the quality of life for the public housing residents at Walkling Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6832.48s">And</a>  we think that the process that was required for the public input <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6838.72s">during</a>  the conceptual planning stage has really helped to create a project that fits well in the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6844.964s">And</a>  I think that this zoning is a very appropriate way of being able to bring that plan to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6854.429s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=6855.45s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Portrait]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7079.528s">Roseberry</a>  portrait of 78 Orchard Street in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7083.477s">I</a>  don't live that far from the development. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7087.059s">I've</a>  been involved with the development for many years, starting as a teenager and now into my adulthood, I do a lot of things for a lot of the residents there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7098.624s">Unfortunately,</a>  I know there is opposition, but to me, if we can put more people that don't have adequate housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7110.733s">into</a>  an adequate housing that has an elevator, which none of the buildings in Rockland Court right now have. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7119.359s">And</a>  some of those residents now that live there, I know personally, are at a big disadvantage because they can't walk up the stairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7130.887s">They</a>  can't even walk over to Whole Foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7133.789s">They</a>  depend on people to come in and help them as much as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7139.035s">I'm</a>  one of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7140.055s">I</a>  have some of the residents that call me saying I need groceries and I'll definitely go over and I'll do it for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7149.399s">I've</a>  watched people come and go out of that development. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7153.32s">I've</a>  watched it grow and now it's falling apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7159.402s">And</a>  they really definitely need this building to be able to live freely and hopefully <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7168.649s">be</a>  able to get out again and do what they need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7175.611s">It's</a>  sad that they have to stay in their houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7179.673s">That</a>  causes more depression. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7181.774s">And</a>  to me, that's a health issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7185.275s">And</a>  that costs us as taxpayers more money because we have to pay for those disabilities to get readjusted. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7195.658s">And</a>  it's not fair to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7198.56s">Um,</a>  there were a couple of residents here that needed to go home that wanted to speak, and that's basically what they were going to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7205.745s">And</a>  I'm just here to relay their message as well as mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7211.028s">I've</a>  watched a lot of people come and go, and it's sad, but we really need to let these people have a good life. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7221.534s">We,</a>  as individuals, have a good life in our homes or <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7226.59s">in</a>  our neighborhoods, and we've watched developments go up and down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7231.274s">But</a>  this would give many, many people an enjoyable place to live and let them enjoy their freedom again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7241.524s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Gerard]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7252.04s">My</a>  name is Susan Gerard. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7254.601s">I</a>  live at 26 Farragut Ave, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7257.462s">I</a>  don't live near Walkling. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7259.663s">Many</a>  years ago, I tutored a Russian immigrant who had pancreatic cancer, who lived in Walkling Court, and she could not handle the stairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7270.626s">She</a>  had to move out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7273.407s">Luckily,</a>  she was able to find <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7276.563s">another</a>  senior housing unit to live in that had elevators, but others were not so lucky, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7285.149s">I</a>  also just want to say I've had many friends in Medford who are seniors who needed this kind of affordable housing, but the lists are, I think, two or three years long waiting lists <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7300.94s">And</a>  this, I've lived in Medford for 42 years and I've never seen a truly affordable housing project like Walkling Court in the 42 years really being built. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7316.108s">And</a>  I think this is just an amazing opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7319.57s">I</a>  know there is some criticisms and there always will be of anything that gets built, but to me, this is a beautiful chance for people to have decent homes to live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7329.875s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zisk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7363.24s">My</a>  name is Peggy Zisk, and I live in Tadnisher Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7368.164s">And</a>  I'm not really against, but I do want to point out a couple of details that the Auckland Court is a little dense. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7382.755s">I</a>  went into the planning commission and looked at the plans, because people <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7389.927s">said</a>  that it's the same height as the building on the north side, which is the commercial buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7395.389s">But</a>  if you go and look at those buildings, there are four stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7399.21s">These</a>  are six, which means that the units inside will only be seven-foot ceilings after you take out for the plumbing and the false ceilings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7411.154s">If</a>  anyone has ever lived in public housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7415.187s">or</a>  worked in public housing, that's really uncomfortable living. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7421.936s">It's</a>  a little bit depressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7424.279s">The</a>  buildings that they have proposed for the elderly is pretty long hallways and very short ceilings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7433.332s">And</a>  if you've ever lived in an elderly housing building or visited anyone, your grandparents, your parents, they're not very exciting places because they don't have a lot of energy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7446.517s">So</a>  isolating people in a community and doubling the density is going to bring down the level quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7457.373s">for</a>  people. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7458.234s">They're</a>  going to have air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7459.535s">They're</a>  going to love that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7460.837s">I've</a>  already talked to some people in that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7462.939s">They</a>  think it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7464.16s">They're</a>  going to have better heating. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7466.082s">They're</a>  going to have elevators. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7468.504s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7469.585s">They're</a>  also going to have twice as many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7473.329s">If</a>  you look at any housing project from Chicago to Somerville, they don't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7481.304s">They</a>  become, eventually, over the years, people get stuck for generations in low-income housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7489.627s">People</a>  who can move out do move out, and people who can't stay, and the quality of life is lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7496.049s">So</a>  it's great, we should build elderly housing, for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7502.071s">Should</a>  you pack the density in twice the number of people into those buildings? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7508.553s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7509.503s">So</a>  you shouldn't, it's fine to rezone it if you want to rezone it, but as you said before, I don't think there's really a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7517.829s">This</a>  is more a response to an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7521.711s">I'm</a>  not sure Menford has a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7524.713s">We</a>  have squandered quite a few opportunities down by the river where there was lots of opportunity for housing and to incorporate low income housing with middle income and high income housing, and it's gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7539.045s">The</a>  buildings are beautiful, but wealthy people live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7544.026s">And</a>  so I discourage you from rezoning a parcel just to fix a project and squeeze as many low-income people as possible into a very concentrated neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7563.03s">And</a>  currently, the plan that they have is turning <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7568.252s">kind</a>  of a nice green space if you walk around in there to purely concrete streets with lots of parking and very little green. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7578.296s">Even</a>  though they said 10%, it's very unattractive plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7584.058s">I</a>  don't know if anyone's looked at the plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7587.199s">So</a>  thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7589.16s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7590.78s">And</a>  I'm gonna go to, I know we had someone here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7593.702s">If</a>  you wanna come and then I'll go to Diane on Zoom and we'll go in person first. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7600.464s">name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Angela Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7603.366s">Angela</a>  Murphy, 16 Codding Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7605.887s">I've</a>  been on Codding Street 67 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7608.628s">I've</a>  been there when Walking Court was built as a beautiful suburban senior community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7615.012s">As</a>  the previous speaker said, I want to recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7622.022s">that</a>  this zoning be disapproved, the change, because of all the reasons she stated, which I have written down, the same reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7631.466s">The</a>  quality of life for the residents that the buildings for the seniors is proposed for, I don't believe will be enhanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7639.969s">They're</a>  going to be abutting a railroad commuter train track. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7644.159s">The</a>  back apartments will face, if you're housebound, look out your window and all you will see is train tracks and a building overshadowing yours, which will cause sunlight to be limited because it's going to be higher elevation than your six-story building. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7663.148s">You're</a>  condensing, again, too many people into the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7667.29s">You're</a>  eliminating a lot of green space that was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7671.925s">I</a>  think, while yes, there is a definite need for low-income housing, senior housing, disabled housing, I as a 72-year-old senior would not want to live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7684.434s">I</a>  would not want my autistic grandson to move into a disabled housing <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7690.056s">there</a>  in this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7691.937s">I</a>  would not want my disabled sister, who's in a wheelchair, to live in this complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7697.741s">I</a>  am not against building a senior housing project, not a project, a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7703.325s">I</a>  call it a community because this, to me, is a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7706.767s">It's</a>  not a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7709.649s">I</a>  would not oppose building something there, scaling down <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7714.238s">the</a>  six-story buildings, reconfigurating the design so that the buildings are not horizontal along the track, but perpendicular, so that the stairwells, windows will face the unsightly view, have more green space. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7731.132s">The</a>  community gardens, they want to relocate to <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7737.042s">an</a>  area of the complex that is not fit for growing things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7741.346s">So</a>  nothing's going to grow. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7742.227s">They're</a>  going to take down mature trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7744.75s">And</a>  as she said, our previous speaker, the green space is going to be limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7749.955s">It's</a>  not going to be a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7752.037s">It's</a>  going to be a project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7755.0s">And</a>  our quality of life for those residents they proposed for will not be enhanced. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7760.97s">And</a>  yes, I think Medford should build something there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7764.072s">Yes,</a>  I loved Walkland Court when it was built. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7766.453s">I</a>  still love going there and seeing it and walking through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7771.556s">And</a>  I one day thought when my house passed on to my children, I may live in Walkland Court, but now I would not if this proposal goes through. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7780.141s">Let's</a>  find a plan that Medford can build on that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7784.564s">And</a>  I challenge every councilor here <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7786.945s">to</a>  come down to that site and look at that site and see what they're proposing and see how congested it's going to be and see what's going to do to surrounding neighbors and the community that it's going to be integrated into and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7802.011s">Parking's</a>  going to overflow onto streets which is already crowded. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7806.805s">and</a>  residents coming and going, visitors, health aides, Meals on Wheels people, deliveries, it's gonna be nonstop. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7816.61s">We</a>  have one-way streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7818.091s">We</a>  have bad traffic from Route 16 already. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7821.753s">Cars</a>  speed down past the park on linemen and clotting because they're going the wrong way, and they wanna hit Winter Street before they hit another car coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7830.818s">I</a>  can't tell you how many times I almost got hit coming out of my own driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7835.376s">So</a>  67 years I've lived in that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7838.137s">This,</a>  I think, would be a shame to build this particular proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7843.479s">I</a>  think rethink other proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7847.141s">Another</a>  thing I want to say is all the public meetings, all the notices, I live on Carding Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7853.783s">I</a>  don't live within the 400 radius they're obligated to inform, but I never, never once informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7861.126s">of</a>  anything going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7863.327s">If</a>  it wasn't for a neighbor of mine, I would not know. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7865.947s">And</a>  at one public meeting, I went to Walkland Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7869.288s">I</a>  was verbally berated by the complex manager while the housing authority person stood there and let her berate me, try to intimidate me, and stop me from asking questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7884.093s">As</a>  you can see, I'm nervous now talking here, but I'm not a dumb old woman. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7889.845s">I</a>  know what fits there and I think everybody should go down there and double check what they want to do to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7896.768s">Thank</a>  you for listening to me. <a

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7898.769s">We're</a>  going to go to Diane on zoom and then we'll come back person. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7905.351s">Uh,</a>  Diane, name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[McKinney]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7909.093s">Hi,</a>  Diane McKinney, 29 North street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7911.754s">I'm</a>  a co-owner of the home directly abutting <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7916.083s">the</a>  proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7917.484s">I'm</a>  with everybody that, you know, Medford needs to have affordable housing for disabled, for the elderly, and I'm not against that in any way, shape or form. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7929.252s">I'm</a>  strictly against the size and the scope of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7934.655s">You've</a>  got a huge six-story building going in the middle <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7941.005s">of</a>  a neighborhood of single, double floor homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7947.386s">there's</a>  going to be immense traffic impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7950.467s">They</a>  do have a traffic study on the plans that was done that took in account, I believe, the COVID impact, but I don't recall seeing any impact related to the new T station down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7965.311s">With</a>  the top station, there's also some words about having them extend that green line down towards <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7973.814s">I</a>  don't know the name of the road down there, but past where the U-Haul place was around that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7979.337s">And</a>  I just think that this project, the size and the scope is just going to overwhelm that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7986.662s">And</a>  I agree with the woman before who said, you know, people need to go down and actually look at that area and see what a six, two six story buildings are going to do to that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=7998.496s">Also,</a>  there's a thousand plus petition of neighbors and community residents who have signed a petition against this proposal, basically for those reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8014.246s">And</a>  we never hear talk about that during these calls and these proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8019.469s">And</a>  it just needs to be brought to the attention of the council that there is opposition not <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8027.298s">not</a>  as a NIMBY type of atmosphere, but simply because of the size and the scope of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8033.82s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8034.18s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8045.464s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8046.344s">You</a>  can bend it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8047.144s">There</a>  you go.</p>

    <p>[Ducey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8047.744s">Hi.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8048.005s">Mary</a>  Anna Ducey, 2 North Street, Metro. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8052.386s">A</a>  couple of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8053.126s">I</a>  want to talk about first the process here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8056.851s">for</a>  this meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8058.352s">There</a>  was a September 14th public meeting notice in the newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8062.593s">It</a>  was a combined notice about both the October 4th community development meeting and this meeting tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8071.076s">And</a>  so that was really two months before tonight's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8076.538s">In</a>  past public meeting notices that were in the newspaper, the meeting usually followed within two or three weeks after the notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8083.902s">that</a>  this meeting tonight is two months after the notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8087.363s">Now,</a>  I don't know if that's two months is too long a period. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8094.544s">Is</a>  it legal to have a long period like that? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8098.745s">And</a>  if so, does this process need to be repeated because of the notification period was too long? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8106.707s">It</a>  is legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8107.307s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8111.641s">The</a>  second thing is that the text of this notice said that for this Community Development Board meeting, questions and comments can be submitted via email to the Community Development Office or by phone to their number. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8129.588s">So</a>  I went to the Community Development Office and asked if I could see these public comments, which I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8136.291s">And</a>  they gave me copies of both the postal and the email comments, but they said they were not <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8141.702s">counting</a>  the phone comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8144.584s">Apparently</a>  some phone comments came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8151.468s">Even</a>  though the newspaper said that they could accept phones, but they weren't gonna accept the phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8155.691s">They</a>  took them in, but they weren't gonna count them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8159.194s">So</a>  they have recently started, the Community Development Office, referring people who call in comments to send in written comments instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8170.088s">So</a>  therefore the question is, is the validity of this particular public hearing notice, and because of the fact that they weren't accepting, they had the phone there and they weren't accepting the phones, does that need to be repeated? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8190.952s">Because</a>  they're not accepting all the comments they got. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8194.372s">So</a>  I don't know, probably can't answer that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8197.073s">Probably</a>  requires a legal, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8199.512s">decision.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8201.874s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8202.414s">Then,</a>  I don't have email myself, but someone saw a bunch of emails from a Medford Housing Advocacy Group who asked Councilor Collins when the vote on the Swarling Court zoning was going to happen, because they wanted to submit comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8225.249s">And</a>  Councilor Collins told them about <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8232.266s">that</a>  the real vote of this zoning was gonna happen tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8236.667s">There</a>  was the October 4th meeting, but the real vote was gonna happen tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8241.408s">Then</a>  on a couple of days later, Director Hunt from the Community Development Office clarified this whole process with a more detailed explanation of Councilor Collins' explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8258.398s">and</a>  said that the matter, on the matter of the count, let me see, the chain process, and the comments on this matter count, the matter will count, it can influence the process really tonight, because tonight is really when the vote was gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8278.423s">And</a>  then later on that same day, our incoming city councilor emailed the same advocacy group <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8288.77s">and</a>  said, thanks to Director Hunt, because now we know when we should intervene. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8296.331s">So,</a>  apparently, it appears to me that this advocacy group has got information that the general public doesn't know about, because all the general public saw, if you saw it, was the newspaper announcement that talked about the October 4th meeting and tonight's meeting, respond by email or respond by phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8319.115s">So,</a>  therefore the general public hasn't got the same information that people on the advocacy group <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8329.74s">got</a>  from city officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8331.962s">So</a>  I'm just bringing that to everybody's attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8335.044s">So</a>  whether that matters here, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8339.507s">As</a>  far as the petition, I was the one that did the petition and went circulated. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8343.93s">I</a>  got, as I told you before, you've all got copies, 1,131 signatures on the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8353.117s">The</a>  people who signed the petition are not opposed to <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8356.962s">developing</a>  Rockland Court. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8358.883s">They're</a>  opposed to the design and the scale and the number of people that are gonna be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8364.686s">The</a>  community wasn't, beyond the 400 feet, the community around Rockland Court was not notified about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8371.429s">They</a>  were surprised when I came with the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8374.45s">They</a>  didn't know anything about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8376.391s">So</a>  the community doesn't have information about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8382.73s">The</a>  original architect that did the 1960s plan put the buildings along the track perpendicular to the track, not parallel with the track. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8393.641s">Even</a>  though these are going to be modern buildings, nice buildings, and all that, half of the units are still going to face the railroad track. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8401.609s">Now,</a>  if any of you have elderly grandparents or people that you know, people who don't go out very much that are housebound, it's very depressing when all they have to look out to is a train track and a train. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8415.001s">I</a>  had an elderly grandmother who couldn't go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8418.464s">She</a>  used to sit by the window and watch the people that went by just as an uplifting thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8425.97s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8427.455s">even</a>  though it's a nice building, and they compare it to other buildings that have been built in Somerville and further on down the track, those buildings in Somerville are probably adults, working people, who go out every day, who only come home at night, so they don't have to worry about looking out the window, but seniors, this is their life, the ones that are housebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8447.528s">Marion,</a>  I do wanna... Yeah, I'll wrap it up here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8450.01s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8451.11s">Okay,</a>  so in short, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8455.101s">The</a>  1,100 people that signed the petition are not opposed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8460.105s">They</a>  just want the design to be modified. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8464.088s">It's</a>  too much in too small an area, and the community around there has not been consulted about what it's gonna do to us, or even considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8472.795s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8758.458s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8758.739s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to come up to the mic, please? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8769.108s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Goloso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8772.129s">Andrew</a>  Goloso, 3 Northern Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8776.97s">Let's</a>  come back to the councilor Scarpelli's question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8783.212s">What</a>  is the vision for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8785.913s">And</a>  what do we see? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8788.074s">We</a>  see this six-story building for elderly and disabled who would see from the windows, the rail tracks, listen to the noise, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8799.118s">And</a>  this green line extension, the railroad tracks even get closer. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8807.7s">And</a>  these are the people who gave their best lives to the country, some of them disabled, some of them probably veterans who sacrificed their life, who risked their lives for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8822.744s">And</a>  on the other hand, we have this family housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8828.568s">for</a>  families without disabilities in townhouses, shoot it from the noise, just behind them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8838.03s">Does</a>  it make any sense? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8842.992s">So</a>  I would reconsider the plan, how it was done, and consider what its vision would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8848.853s">The</a>  affordable housing is important, considering that the inflation and the rise in rents <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8857.194s">So</a>  definitely, it's essential. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8859.935s">But</a>  it's important to have affordable housing with dignity. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8865.358s">It's</a>  important to have housing to make sure that our elderly are protected. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8873.801s">Who</a>  would put their mothers, grandmothers, or grandparents, or anyone with disability to live against the rail tracks? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8886.77s">And</a>  this is the housing for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8888.171s">Most</a>  of the time, it's for permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8893.374s">It's</a>  gonna be until the end of their life. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8897.536s">And</a>  this is, I'm sure we could do better than this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8903.259s">And</a>  regarding the meetings, you're talking about engaging. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8909.042s">Well,</a>  the engaging word means you work both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8914.125s">I</a>  didn't feel we had engagements. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8917.415s">I</a>  think we had more serving. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8919.997s">We</a>  have been served with what they want, and each time we raise the issues, and pretty much most of them have been ignored, have been considered, have been documented, but ignored. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8938.551s">This</a>  is not engagement. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8942.334s">So</a>  for the vision, it's important to consider <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8948.853s">what</a>  needs to be done here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8951.774s">And</a>  I would request the council to ask the team who works on this important project to think about it and revise the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8965.561s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8966.682s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8966.942s">I'm</a>  going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.</p>

    <p>[Ilene Lerner]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8975.907s">Can</a>  you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8977.53s">Yes,</a>  can you hear me now? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=8980.072s">I</a>  I stand in opposition to the development I too feel we need affordable housing, but this is definitely not the project that we need Um, and I because of all the reasons that have been raised so far But also I have another question that has not been answered which is what did the um <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9003.497s">the</a>  environmental review of the site revealed, because someone at one of the meetings did admit that they found some chemicals in the soil. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9013.323s">And</a>  I asked, well, I asked, what are the chemicals? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9019.106s">Have</a>  they been removed? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9022.108s">Or</a>  if they need to be removed, how much is it going to cost to do the remediation? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9030.325s">But</a>  I just don't think this is an appropriate site for all the reasons that the previous speakers have raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9037.953s">So</a>  thank you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9040.976s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9041.316s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition of the project, either in person or on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9051.587s">Seeing</a>  none. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9054.245s">We're</a>  sure the public hearing is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9055.706s">Is</a>  there any additional questions from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9057.406s">And</a>  I know we have like one or two hanging questions from residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9060.188s">I</a>  don't know if Mr. Chicarello or executive director Driscoll, as far as like their findings from the environmental study, if that's something that's shared or public or anyone can speak to that.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9073.754s">I</a>  think the questions are just.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9080.123s">Yeah,</a>  just the question just being, you know, what was found and, you know, what the remediation steps are. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9088.547s">Just</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9118.812s">Most</a>  of the site is urban feel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9120.992s">And</a>  as most of us know, urban feel back in the days was not really controlled. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9126.873s">So</a>  we, and I don't want to get technical about stuff that's in there, but we have not really found anything there that is not common urban feel around Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9136.555s">And</a>  the idea is that we're still going on investigations to fully delineate what's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9144.856s">But</a>  by the time the project is done, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9149.588s">we</a>  are following all the states and federal regulations to really clean up the site. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9156.53s">So,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9157.37s">So,</a>  like, if somebody wants to get more technical, yeah, all these reports and ongoing investigation are part of the submissions, and we'll be including any further submissions, especially during the special permit process.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9169.653s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9172.273s">Any</a>  other questions from councillors or discussion from councillors at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9177.595s">Councilor</a>  Craviel.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9178.937s">So</a>  is there anything in the soil that prevents housing? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9182.738s">Maybe</a>  I didn't understand this question, but.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9191.48s">You</a>  can answer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9194.361s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9195.061s">Madam</a>  President, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9197.822s">So</a>  under state regulation, if they were to find anything that were to not allow housing, they must by law clean it up before they could build housing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9209.035s">So</a>  either the results will find nothing that's a problem, or they must clean it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9214.54s">They</a>  cannot build the housing under state law with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9217.983s">And</a>  when you do a project like this, you have somebody called a licensed site professional that holds professional license that they could lose if they don't actually make sure we follow the law as part of that process, which is why I have complete confidence that it would be completely safe to live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9233.876s">The</a>  standards for residential are much higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9236.579s">than</a>  most of the other standards that you'll find.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9239.08s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9241.861s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9245.002s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9246.123s">I</a>  have some general comments, but I know a lot of commenters brought up concerns about traffic in the neighborhood, which I know is an existing concern for the neighborhood as is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9255.486s">We</a>  brought our previous meeting on this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9258.295s">We</a>  did get some more in-depth analysis of how the MHA arrived at the recommendation of 0.5 parking spaces per unit, and as I recall, at the time there was even some discussion about are we even overshooting the need based on the analysis of residents and frequent visitors and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9275.541s">Since</a>  that was raised a lot in this meeting, I was just curious if the MHA wanted to speak to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9282.182s">While</a>  we have this platform for further discussion, just because my recollection was that this number was arrived at after rounding up rather than rounding down.</p>

    <p>[Ciccariello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9292.307s">So</a>  what we're actually proposing more parking than the 0.5, it's 0.5 spaces for the senior disabled mid-rise. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9301.452s">The</a>  family units are getting at one parking space per. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9305.276s">So</a>  yeah, but for the phase one senior mid-rise building, it's 0.5 spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9312.86s">But</a>  yeah, each family unit will get one space because families tend to be, most families may have a car in the household. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9322.025s">Even</a>  though in affordable housing, it's very expensive to own a car nowadays, but we feel that one space per household is adequate.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9330.409s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9331.31s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9333.051s">Further</a>  discussion from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9339.685s">Do</a>  I have a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9343.848s">Councilor</a>  Collins?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9615.289s">Good</a>  evening, I'm Danielle Evans, Senior Planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9618.07s">This</a>  is the referral meeting, so not the public hearing, not the time to talk about any substantive content of the draft ordinance, but basically, just to give you some background, this has been a long planning effort <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9637.876s">Last</a>  summer, we were able to hire a consultant for free provided by Mass Housing Partnership that analyzed parcel by parcel around all of the eligible station areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9649.724s">And</a>  there is a compliance model that you enter in all of the parcel information, all of the zoning inputs, and then it spits out how many units could conceivably yield. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9663.86s">And</a>  the number that we're mandated to have is 6,443, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9669.202s">And</a>  when you take out all of the excluded land, like Tufts University, META-owned land, open space, the only real place that worked was Wellington Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9681.647s">So</a>  we moved forward with drafting an amendment to create what we're calling the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District, which would be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9694.342s">what</a>  an overlay is, that it would be on top of the existing underlying zoning, which is the mixed use zoning districts and industrial. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9703.669s">And</a>  across 28, I believe there's more industrial or maybe an apartment three. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9714.596s">So</a>  the first public hearing would be tomorrow at the Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9720.34s">We</a>  have a very quick timeline as a <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9723.943s">the</a>  public hearing on December 12th. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9725.663s">As</a>  a subway community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9726.964s">We</a>  are supposed to have this approved by the end of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9729.644s">Um</a>  we have advertised. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9733.145s">The</a>  public hearing to come to you all City Council on December 12th.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9742.087s">So</a>  just to be <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9749.608s">at</a>  the end of the month for two meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9751.669s">If</a>  they decide they don't want to pass, they want to review it for two meetings before sending you a recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9757.153s">And</a>  then the city council has two meetings in December, which gives you that timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9762.596s">We've</a>  also offered that we can do a committee of the whole, our zoning consultant has offered to come in and do what she's calling for other communities, MBTA zoning 101. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9774.979s">where</a>  she would come in and talk about the whole MBTA zoning, do that briefing for about an hour, one evening, and then have, so that when you're presented with the zoning itself, you've already gotten that background on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9788.832s">If</a>  you want, we could actually use that Committee of the Whole to talk about Medford-specific zoning, although it might be awkward because it would be in the middle of the CD board <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9800.823s">public</a>  hearing process, and it would be right before you open your own public hearing on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9805.485s">So</a>  I'm not really sure how that would line up, but we're happy to have the consultant come in and talk about the MBT zoning as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9812.429s">But</a>  the item on the agenda tonight, this is, as you all know, with zoning, is a legal required referral. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9818.992s">The</a>  board actually, the council doesn't actually have a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9821.473s">They</a>  have to refer it to the CD board for comment tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9824.534s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9826.917s">Just</a>  a quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9827.998s">What</a>  do the residents in Wilmington say?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9831.04s">So</a>  we've held one public meeting on this and the reality is we have to pass this to stay in compliance with the state and we cannot do it, we can't make it work in any other part of the city.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9844.189s">So</a>  will the residents of Wilmington know about this?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9847.051s">I</a>  don't know what they know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9849.993s">They've</a>  been advertised to as the rest of the city has.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9854.528s">Again,</a>  it's the same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9857.249s">It's</a>  really the same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9858.99s">You're</a>  in front of us today to hold something through that has to be accepted tonight.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9863.132s">This</a>  is actually the zoning.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9868.474s">When</a>  a zoning amendment comes to this council from anybody whatsoever, you have to- I know that, but the way you presented it, it seems like even after this process, it seems like it's going to go pretty quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9881.038s">It</a>  has to be done right away.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9883.343s">You</a>  may take that up with the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9884.825s">I</a>  am very sorry about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9888.088s">We</a>  have argued with the state many times about this timeline. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9891.011s">We</a>  don't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9892.613s">They've</a>  changed the rules on us several times since this law was passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9896.917s">We</a>  don't like that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9898.098s">They</a>  actually, after our last meeting with the state, gave us more consulting time and provided additional free consulting to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9905.133s">but</a>  the state timeline does not allow for very much public input. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9908.855s">We've</a>  had a public meeting on it, and we will have two public hearings on it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9914.118s">One</a>  public meeting on it? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9915.618s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9916.119s">So</a>  when did we find out about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9917.399s">When</a>  did your office find out about it?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9920.501s">It's</a>  been out there for more than a year, but they've changed the rules on it, and the regulations came out in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9928.385s">So</a>  we've only had the regulations to work within the compliance model since May.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9934.73s">August,</a>  actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9935.931s">They</a>  revised it in August with an end of December deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9940.973s">I</a>  was pulling my hair out.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9944.014s">Again,</a>  these are things that, some things that just out of your control, but in the totality of these processes, it just doesn't look good. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9953.838s">It's</a>  no different than the voting situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9955.938s">It</a>  just doesn't look good. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9957.639s">I</a>  consistently get, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9960.722s">constituents</a>  that reach out and say, we knew nothing about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9964.985s">We</a>  didn't hear this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9966.606s">And</a>  so I think, you know, as a council, we need to figure out a way whenever we put these projects out, that there's gotta be some assistance that if they don't have the funding or anything that has to be done, because the biggest issues we have to come back to us are the constituents that they knew nothing about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9986.402s">I,</a>  you know, I, we, we had, we were fortunate enough with the last speaker, the last project that the housing authority did a lot of the legwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9996.203s">on</a>  their dime or the way they processed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=9998.364s">But</a>  this is something that I'm hearing over and over again, especially the last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10003.686s">So</a>  I appreciate it, and I understand that the situation's a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10007.708s">And</a>  it's just not fair, because I know what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10010.989s">We're</a>  going to get phone calls tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10012.13s">The</a>  people who watch this will all have to say, you don't care about us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10015.411s">The</a>  answer is easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10016.031s">At</a>  least we know now we can say this is state mandated, and this is a situation, and it's out of our hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10021.394s">But</a>  it just doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10025.657s">just</a>  doesn't look good. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10026.818s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10027.378s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10028.038s">So</a>  we would appreciate any assistance in getting the word out to people and letting them know about it, asking them to attend the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10036.182s">And</a>  we do put out a newsletter as well from our office that we try and sign people up to, so they'll know about these meetings as well.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10043.666s">Vice</a>  President Bears, and then Councilor Tsengegh.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10047.207s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10048.308s">Thank</a>  you guys for pulling this together. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10051.209s">I</a>  know <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10053.423s">It</a>  has been a bumpy road with the state process, and I can appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10058.027s">I</a>  just want to kind of put this in the context of the work that we're hopefully going to be talking about hiring someone to work with us very soon, since I think the procurement, the RFPs are due by Thursday, and I'm waiting for the second phase of our zoning work. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10076.12s">It's</a>  my understanding that this is what we need to get into compliance with the law by the deadline that the law requires us to be in compliance by. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10087.722s">But</a>  as we move through the process of looking at the zoning, we could potentially go more in depth on that area, additional changes, look at this district and potentially make adjustments to this district through that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10100.224s">I</a>  just wanna make sure that's correct and that's your understanding as well.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10104.77s">Yes,</a>  I imagine with a comprehensive rezoning of the city that we would change the underlying zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10111.772s">And</a>  so that's one great thing about the overlay is it doesn't affect the underlying. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10118.134s">And</a>  we could always amend the overlay, which is one great advantage of being a city is that we have many bites at the apple. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10125.957s">It's</a>  not like town meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10129.618s">There's</a>  two MBTA communities that are rapid transit <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10133.857s">that</a>  also have the same deadline, and they go by town meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10137.941s">And</a>  they're really going crazy, because they would have another year that they might have to live with something that they don't like. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10145.107s">But</a>  yeah, this is a state meeting.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10147.489s">Arlington</a>  just passed theirs, I think.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10149.831s">Arlington's</a>  ahead of the game, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10153.374s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10154.095s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10154.835s">But</a>  interesting enough, this is actually sort of down zoning, because believe it or not, we actually allow quite a bit of housing units. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10162.678s">It's</a>  just tweaking it so that it's by right with site plan review. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10168.301s">And</a>  we're having an economic feasibility analysis done so that we can keep our inclusionary zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10174.483s">We're</a>  hoping that will be completed soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10177.505s">But</a>  when I say that we're down zoning, basically what we've done is to build in incentives to go higher <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10184.036s">by</a>  providing more affordability or ground floor retail, since we can't require that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10191.017s">So</a>  around a transit station, you would want it to be walkable and for there to be amenities to the people that live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10197.778s">But</a>  unfortunately, the law doesn't allow us to mandate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10201.259s">So</a>  we're building in incentives. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10203.339s">So</a>  hoping that developers would do these things so that they can go higher, which is pretty much already allowed in the MUC. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10213.755s">So</a>  it won't be, it sounds scary, but it's not mandating that any of those units actually get built, but that they'd be zoned so they could be built. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10222.302s">A</a>  lot of it's built out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10224.804s">So</a>  I feel like the big planning and ambitious work that our office does, like this isn't gonna be the panacea that solves the housing crisis. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10235.053s">I</a>  think that we're doing a lot of other things in Medford and we've tried to tailor this to work for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10242.97s">in</a>  a way that furthers all of our goals in a comprehensive way.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10246.552s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10247.233s">And</a>  I just wanted to put that forward just to say that this is not the end all be all here. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10251.716s">And</a>  we have discussed extensively that this council is planning to conduct an extensive public process over the next 18 months to two years on rezoning the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10262.623s">I</a>  think there is no public process that will satisfy all people. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10270.628s">I</a>  do think that doesn't mean that we can't make <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10273.54s">and</a>  even better effort than we are able to do with the resources that we are appropriated by the mayor to reach as many people as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10280.864s">But</a>  I'm really looking forward to the deep work that we're going to be doing together in partnership. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10289.669s">And</a>  I say all of that because I'm super excited for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10292.437s">I</a>  do wanna say, I wish we had seen something or had a meeting on this a little sooner, not necessarily on the draft, but just on the law itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10300.624s">And</a>  I know we've had, did we?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10302.586s">I</a>  just, sorry, well over a year ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10304.647s">So</a>  it's been so long that I've forgotten.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10306.829s">No,</a>  you're not to contradict you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10308.391s">No,</a>  no, no, I take the contradiction.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10309.832s">But</a>  I did just thought, because I was like, we put together a webpage for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10313.635s">I</a>  remember that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10314.476s">And</a>  the webpage exists and on the webpage, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10317.445s">It</a>  has a link to the presentation that we made to this council on March 22nd, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10321.952s">So</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10322.793s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10323.294s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10325.518s">So</a>  that was like right after it passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10328.703s">I</a>  think we should have checked it in between. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10331.655s">And</a>  I don't put that blame on any one party. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10334.798s">Obviously,</a>  I forgot that meeting two years ago too. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10339.043s">And</a>  George just called me a slacker if anyone couldn't hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10343.127s">But</a>  no, you know, we're just, we're good friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10349.213s">But</a>  I just, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10352.121s">I'm</a>  really excited for that partnership, and I appreciate the work that your office has done on this, and worked through an incredibly difficult landscape of changing rules and regulations, and a change in the entire gubernatorial administration from the folks who passed this, and they even renamed the office that was working on it with you, I think, and reorganized it, so I know that's been really difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10372.678s">And</a>  I appreciate that we'll be able to come back and look at this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10374.839s">And</a>  even though that this is what the law requires, that you've been thoughtful about making sure that what we actually want in that area is also still possible.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10386.276s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10386.876s">Um,</a>  I wanted to thank you guys for your work on this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10389.917s">Um,</a>  I know it's really difficult working within the parameters of a state mandate that keeps changing, um, and to get us product before the deadline, I think is an achievement that we should acknowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10402.76s">Um,</a>  I, I think there's, there'll be some time for people to comment on this and for adjustments to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10409.741s">Um,</a>  I think we understand the council understands our tasks tonight, um, and what our vote means and the way that <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10416.863s">in</a>  my opinion it should go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10418.744s">But</a>  I also wanted to say as a resident or as a former resident of Wellington, I am excited to see more action happening there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10427.208s">I</a>  know a lot of residents on the ground feel that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10430.329s">I</a>  know that we've had <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10432.686s">a</a>  lot of conversations about safety and walkability there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10435.468s">And</a>  a more comprehensive plan like this with more incentives built into it creates, I think, an ideal vision, a more ideal vision in that sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10447.538s">Maybe</a>  we make some tweaks, but a more ideal version of what we have that creates a safer neighborhood by making it more walkable and more to incentivize attention to that behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10460.489s">I'm</a>  really grateful for your work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10462.191s">I</a>  know there have been folks writing me about reducing parking minimums even more given the proximity to the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10470.478s">I</a>  think that's something worthy of being talked about. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10473.841s">But</a>  in any case, we'll get into the details with the CD board and with what they recommend, but I'm just very grateful for your work.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10483.05s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10483.811s">Councilor</a>  Cravio.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10484.471s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10486.584s">I</a>  know, Alicia, I know we have talked about this in the past, but what's the status with the T fighting us on this?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10495.127s">I</a>  know they want to put the- The air rights in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10497.148s">So</a>  just for full transparency, while this overlay literally includes the MBTA parcel, it legally does not because legally the MBTA is not bound by our zoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10511.35s">But</a>  if it was to be used for other things, I mean, the air rights and all could fall under this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10520.056s">We</a>  have not had any very recent conversations with the MBTA about their bus facility location, but we have also been talking with the Resilient Mystic Collaborative and doing a lower mystic watershed assessment of buildings and large developments and things and critical infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10541.164s">And</a>  so the Resilient Mystic collaborative is now actually pushing back on the idea that we shouldn't be building new critical infrastructure in serious flood zone locations, and that there may be a very questionable choice to be building one of two electric bus repair and charging stations in an area that's at a high flood zone risk, whereas if you were building <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10565.262s">parking</a>  with apartments on top, that could be built in a way that could handle being in a flood zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10571.766s">Whereas</a>  if an electric bus repair facility was flooded, that could ruin the whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10580.271s">We</a>  don't see how they could flood proof that from saltwater flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10585.294s">So</a>  that is a concern that is being raised to the MBTA at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10589.137s">The</a>  big difficulty is they don't know where else to put that bus facility.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10595.033s">Well,</a>  the train station is also a flood zone.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10597.514s">So</a>  that's a little different because that train station doesn't support all the trains for the entire MBTA fleet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10607.417s">They're</a>  talking about putting a bus depot there that would support half the buses for the entire MBTA regional bus fleet. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10615.48s">And</a>  that's perhaps not the right place for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10618.601s">Whereas</a>  if that location flooded right now, it would knock out one branch of the Orange Line. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10624.534s">that's</a>  not great, but that's not their entire system. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10628.057s">And</a>  that's also not their evacuation system in the event of a major emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10632.461s">Whereas</a>  one could picture if we needed to evacuate the floodable areas in the greater Boston area, we're going to start putting people in buses, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10641.068s">Like</a>  that, obviously. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10643.23s">So</a>  that's, we're starting to raise some of these issues with them.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10646.533s">So</a>  also in the flood area, how does that affect the building process?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10653.633s">It</a>  just includes, there's regulations about how do they have to build so that they can handle withstand flood, things like building certain building standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10664.48s">But</a>  it's very different when it's a building than something like a piece of critical infrastructure. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10670.483s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10675.006s">Does</a>  that answer your question? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10675.867s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10678.909s">Any</a>  further discussion or do I have a motion?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10682.665s">Motion</a>  to refer to Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10684.186s">I'm</a>  sorry, go ahead.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10763.331s">For</a>  Phase 2 of the carpark renovation, the City has also been awarded $1.5 million in federal earmarked funding through the Department of Energy, with the support of Representative Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10774.236s">Carpark</a>  Phase 2 consists of two subportions, deemed Phase 2a and Phase 2b. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10778.838s">The</a>  total cost of Phase 2a is $2,015,000 and was proposed to be funded by the LWCF grant and ARPA funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10788.34s">The</a>  LWCF grant requires that the City Council pass a resolution accepting the grant and acknowledging the dedication of the property as parkland. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10796.367s">The</a>  grant also requires that the full funding for projects be appropriated upon acceptance of the grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10801.592s">The</a>  enclosed drafted resolution addresses these requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10804.415s">The</a>  grant will then reimburse a $1 million portion of the appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10809.285s">Phase</a>  2B of the project has a total cost of $3 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10812.609s">The</a>  federal earmarked funding requires a one-to-one match of non-federal funding to the award. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10817.195s">Please</a>  note that LWCF is a federal grant program administered through the state and therefore cannot be used to match funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10823.915s">I</a>  respect the request and recommend that Phase 2B be funded with $1,385,000 in ARPA funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10830.459s">The</a>  City, spearheaded by Planning, Development and Sustainability, is exploring additional funding sources to complete the $115,000 deficit in funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10840.626s">There</a>  is significant community support for open space and recreation in Medford and the City's commitment to accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10848.06s">Broad</a>  community outreach has been performed to create inclusive, comprehensive vision for Carr Park, and there is a strong community passion and investment in the completion of this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10856.338s">In</a>  summary, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body adopt the enclosed resolution to accept the grant for phase 2A of the car park renovation and authorize a loan order request of $1 million to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10868.188s">As</a>  stated in the resolutions, the LWCF grant will reimburse $1 million on the completion of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10873.773s">In</a>  addition, I respectfully request and recommend that the total of $2.4 million in ARPA funding be allocated to phase 2 of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10882.32s">$1,015,000</a>  of which will go towards Phase 2A, and $1,385,000 of which will go towards Phase 2B. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10890.064s">The</a>  LWCF grant for Carr Park requires that a copy of a certified boat be sent to them by December 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10897.367s">I</a>  hope that these requests have been submitted with sufficient time for the Council to review and meet this important deadline. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10904.21s">Sincerely,</a>  Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10906.851s">Enclosures.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10907.532s">Am</a>  I reading this whole thing too?

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10985.802s">Any</a>  Councilors want to hear what's in phase two regarding the scope of the project? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10989.184s">Councilor</a>  Collins does.</p>

    <p>[Centrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10990.685s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10991.666s">So</a>  phase two has a lot of really interesting things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=10996.588s">Complete</a>  renovation of the playground, splash pad. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11000.15s">small</a>  skate park, two basketball courts, one of which will be covered, sheltered so that play can be extended through rain or if it's really hot out. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11010.073s">And</a>  on that roof will be solar panels, which will power other aspects of the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11016.654s">We</a>  will, what else are the major ones? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11020.776s">There's</a>  a teen area with swings and obstacle course fitness equipment that is appropriate for older kids and adults. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11031.19s">Gazebo</a>  area that's sheltered again and overlooking the playground space Really the intent of this park is I think to make it a multi-generational space All of these things are our ideas that were brought to us by community members So this vision is imaginative and exciting and ambitious and it was the result of a lot of community feedback That's just <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11059.602s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11060.382s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11062.723s">This</a>  is unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11065.285s">We're</a>  so excited about it, it's our neighborhood, and the only thing, I told my 20-year-old, John, I'll take you to the park. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11075.192s">So</a>  I mean, everything about it is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11077.113s">I</a>  think that, I'm sure, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11079.534s">Hunt,</a>  this is one of the reasons, I got about 15 phone calls from the Butters that it's a really big dog-friendly neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11088.557s">And</a>  they're confused that they didn't know about the process fully. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11094.559s">So</a>  this is what, and they wanted to come here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11099.181s">And</a>  I said, well, this isn't about, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11102.342s">that</a>  process. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11103.723s">So</a>  I don't know if there's something we can do to talk with them, set up a separate meeting with these folks that so they can understand the process that you, it was, I believe that the question was, could you do separate areas and construction? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11116.849s">I</a>  don't see that happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11117.77s">So</a>  from what I've been told, so I don't, but I think if that, other than that, I don't think anybody in this country is looking at that, what we're doing up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11129.075s">It's,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11130.385s">it's</a>  really bringing people back up the hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11132.306s">I</a>  mean, it, you know, when you talk about, you know, it's, it's re re re energizing so many different groups, you know, you have the baseball people that are saying, wow, you have, you know, you have new ball fields, we have multi purpose, we have, you know, you know, special needs, you have adults saying that looking for that apparatus park, I mean, this is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11154.643s">You</a>  know, I'm excited to say we're far ahead of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11158.026s">You</a>  know, because this is what I do in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11160.287s">The</a>  people are begging for this in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11162.469s">So</a>  this is in planning stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11164.33s">So</a>  I'm so excited that we're seeing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11166.652s">So</a>  I, you know, and I understand the process we have to go through, the funding mechanism. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11172.175s">It's</a>  nice to see ARPA money being used this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11176.358s">It's</a>  exactly what, you know, you want it to be used for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11180.001s">So</a>  I would move approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11183.802s">Mr.</a>  President, you're gonna get a lot of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11188.925s">The</a>  next two years, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11191.287s">It'll</a>  be a constant reminder of what we're missing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11200.853s">Yes,</a>  approval for first reading on the loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11202.814s">Right,</a>  first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11203.674s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11207.397s">I</a>  do have a question about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11208.497s">Maybe</a>  to Director Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11210.599s">They</a>  want a response by December 1st.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11215.144s">So,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11217.486s">We</a>  were thinking, so the part that needs to be approved is, sorry, on your computer, my computer, exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11226.353s">It's</a>  the, I keep referring to it as the whereases. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11230.576s">Sorry,</a>  I should speak into the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11232.037s">I</a>  know this, sorry it's late. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11233.978s">The</a>  part that needs approval that the state needs to know you voted on is the whereases section. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11241.044s">I</a>  have a loan order. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11243.33s">And</a>  that, I guess, includes, technically, a loan order, which we hadn't been thinking of needing three readings.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11249.392s">We</a>  treat loan orders, and bond counsel has requested that we treat loan orders as ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11255.475s">We</a>  could waive the readings.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11257.695s">I</a>  will say that bond counsel has reviewed this.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11265.378s">Which</a>  one was that? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11267.159s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11273.37s">Mike,</a>  can we, I don't know what the timing is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11275.852s">So</a>  I will tell you that my office has started advertising in the Boston Herald because we could not, we've run out of, it's too difficult to work with Wicked Local between the timelines and their billing department. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11288.582s">We've</a>  actually kind of given up and we've started advertising in the Herald, which really speeds up our turnaround times on advertising of items. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11298.17s">But</a>  I didn't realize that you would need to advertise it in the,</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11302.322s">But</a>  I can, so if we could, we'd have to advertise it in time to take it up for third reading on the 28th for you to get on the 28th and we would</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11312.45s">We</a>  would ask if it could then the legal paper be certified by the clerk's office the next day and not wait till the minutes are approved by the council.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11323.512s">In</a>  terms of the certification of vote, that can get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11327.713s">The</a>  concern here is the advertising because you're right, if we use Wicked Local, we're not going to be able to have an advertising time to have third reading on the 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11337.495s">we'll</a>  figure out how to advertise it so we can get advertised in the Herald. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11342.042s">And</a>  in terms of certifying the vote, that can get done no problem at all.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11348.372s">Yeah,</a>  I think though, in terms of signing <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11352.488s">I</a>  think we should check in offline and make sure, because we don't have a solicitor, we've been mailing things to KP Law to sign on behalf of the city solicitor, which is obviously something we would not like to be doing, but it's where we are at. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11365.571s">So</a>  if we need their signature on a piece of paper, we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11370.692s">We</a>  won't? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11371.473s">I</a>  think we, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11372.793s">I</a>  feel good about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11373.673s">I</a>  think we should double check in on it just to make sure that we don't need someone from KP Law to sign this, but that's two weeks away, so.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11386.025s">Sorry,</a>  we have had this reviewed by bond counsel and KP law before it was on your agenda.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11392.209s">They're</a>  just literally signing ordinances as city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11394.931s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11395.892s">And</a>  that's just it's a part of the formal process to have on that brief paper.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11402.742s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11403.202s">They</a>  won't need it to go on the green paper, because the green paper is the last step. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11406.925s">As</a>  long as the mayor has approved the ordinance, after the council approves it for third reading and then the mayor approves it, it would then go on to the green paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11414.93s">So</a>  it would still be an ordinance once the mayor signs it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11419.353s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11419.513s">So</a>  I have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11425.237s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11435.393s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11440.875s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11444.176s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11444.477s">Six</a>  in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11446.237s">None</a>  of the negative one absent motion is approved for first reading.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11468.56s">All</a>  right, I think we're under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11472.322s">Do</a>  I have a motion to revert? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11474.744s">Motion</a>  of Councilor Scarpelli to revert back to regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11479.526s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11480.267s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11481.388s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11482.868s">Find</a>  book page 18. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11488.432s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="../resolutions/23-449.pdf"><font color="green">23-449</font></a> offered by Councilor Collins.

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11497.576s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11498.436s">I'm</a>  bringing this forward after some back and forth with residents who are concerned about excessive wildlife feeding that they've been noticing in their neighborhood that they've been unable to resolve through neighbor outreach alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11512.283s">This</a>  proposal would be simply in the interest of curbing excessive or inappropriate wildlife feeding, not talking about rural bird feeders, not trying to steal anybody's joy, in residential areas in the interest of keeping homes <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11524.797s">and</a>  porches and yards free from animal traffic, food, waste, detritus, harms to peace and health. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11532.563s">There</a>  are some nearby communities to ours that have passed similar ordinances just in order to enable code enforcement to intervene around this when necessary that we can look to as a jumping off point. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11544.532s">So</a>  I would motion to approve and send a subcommittee.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11549.385s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11551.606s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11555.929s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11557.01s">Motion</a>  passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11558.07s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11560.071s">Subcommittee</a>  on ordinances and rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11564.614s">You're</a>  just the easiest person to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11573.554s">All</a>  right, 23-452 offered by Councilor Collins, Councilor Tseng, and President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11577.097s">Be</a>  it resolved that Metro City Council recognize Transgender Day of Remembrance on November 20th, 2023, and commit to remembering all those lost to anti-trans violence, honoring all those affected by anti-trans violence, bigotry, standing with our transgender community members, and reaffirming their right to thrive and live authentically. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11593.691s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11595.413s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, and thank you to yourself and Councilor Tseng for joining with me on this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11600.913s">Transgender</a>  Day of Remembrance is observed on November 20th. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11604.535s">This</a>  is the day to think about and remember those who have tragically lost their lives due to hatred and bigotry and violence simply for being who they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11616.482s">And</a>  it's a day to contemplate those who paved the way for others in the trans and greater LGBTQ plus community to be able to live their authentic lives and thrive in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11630.367s">against</a>  the history of hardship, enduring hardship. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11634.229s">So</a>  I appreciate this opportunity to reaffirm our solidarity with the trans community and to have a moment to contemplate sacrifices and tragedies that have come before us and the work ahead to a fully equitable and safe society for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11648.634s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11651.431s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins, for initiating this, and thank you to my fellow co-sponsors on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11658.615s">This</a>  is something that is really important to me personally, as someone who's grown up with a lot of transgender friends who've been bullied and attacked on the streets, not in Medford, but in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11673.103s">And,</a>  you know, it's important, I think, to really shed light, bring attention to this, because everyone deserves to live in dignity. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11680.527s">And</a>  I think it's also particularly important to acknowledge the intersectionality of transgender violence in our country as well, especially the higher rates at which Black transgender folks and Indigenous transgender folks face violence and bigotry in public. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11699.711s">And</a>  so I'm really grateful for the Council for taking this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11704.112s">And</a>  there's still so much more work to do, but I'm very proud to be a co-sponsor of this one.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11710.035s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tsengh, and thank you to you and Councilor Collins for sponsoring this with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11714.22s">The</a>  Transgender Day of Remembrance came after the result of the murders of two black transgender women in Alston and Watertown, so very close. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11724.675s">I</a>  mean, it just speaks to it being in our backyard. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11726.416s">Sometimes</a>  I think we think living in an area like this, it's not something that's faced by the community, but of course it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11733.319s">And</a>  I think that Councilor Tseng's point, this really highlights the intersectionality of the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11737.821s">And</a>  I think it's important this year, it's important every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11741.102s">But</a>  as you know, we have record-breaking numbers of transgender, anti-transgender legislation being presented across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11748.699s">That</a>  has very real impacts because of the legislation, but because it further others this community and lets people look at them as different and people that they should not treat with the dignity and respect they deserve like the rest of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11761.545s">So</a>  if in small part we can bring this forward from the city council, say we remember, say this is important, that I'm glad we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11770.805s">Councilor</a>  Beres. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=11771.305s">Vice-Chancellor</a>  Beres.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12148.852s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12149.893s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12697.483s">If</a>  I can, Madam President, I know that one thing that I need to mention again is the commitment of the football program to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12707.97s">I</a>  think that shines brighter than any win we've ever had. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12712.993s">And</a>  I think that's what's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12714.694s">Their</a>  commitment to the community and volunteering. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12717.416s">I</a>  think it's it <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12719.36s">They</a>  don't have to win a game for what they do with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12722.063s">So</a>  I applaud you guys for doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12723.945s">But</a>  I think that coach Curley has to take a lot of credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12727.029s">But</a>  I also have done this. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12728.791s">People</a>  have to understand if you didn't live in Medford, if you didn't go to Medford High School, if you didn't play a sport. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12736.43s">If</a>  you didn't have the luck of having Steve Miller as your equipment manager at Medford High or live in that era, you truly don't understand what it means to be a true Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12752.545s">I</a>  mean, you know, Bud Kelly, he coined the term blue and white flowing through your veins and legitimately, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12761.574s">I,</a>  my freshman year, I wanted to cut myself just to see if I was, is it true? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12765.877s">Because</a>  that's how much it would convince you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12767.559s">But</a>  I will tell you.</p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12768.459s">Buddy</a>  once told me that you can only see it if you're in the room with an actual Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12772.883s">So</a>  if you cut yourself and you see red, the other guy in the room is not a real Mustang.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12776.226s">Don't</a>  do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12777.867s">If</a>  you come to the game next Thursday, you can buy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12785.453s">And</a>  I believe blue and white t-shirt. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12788.295s">I</a>  do believe blue and white, but I will tell you my point to saying this is that it's very different because when you hear some people say it, you know, Mustang pride, you know, there's some clowns that do do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12798.761s">And</a>  that's just a word for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12801.803s">But</a>  we appreciate you, Chris, because I think you keep that alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12806.706s">And</a>  and I think that's what you're seeing the change with these kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12810.509s">It's</a>  not just John Curley. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12812.17s">It's</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12812.87s">Chris</a>  Murphy's energy to say, hey, listen, being a Method Mustang is part of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12818.653s">And</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12820.054s">We're</a>  Method Mustangs behind this reel. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12821.975s">It's</a>  like, you feel like part of the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12823.816s">And</a>  that's what I think our whole community is lacking right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12826.838s">We're</a>  forgetting that we're all Mustangs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12829.88s">And</a>  maybe if people lived like that a little bit more and understood that to be true, I think that it would stop a lot of animosity in our community.</p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12838.245s">And,</a>  you know, and- These are things that, I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12843.181s">You</a>  and I have lost a lot of mentors in the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12847.823s">I</a>  can't, I could, you know, between Joe Grandy, Bud Kelly, Armin Caraviello, I could go on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12856.465s">And,</a>  you know, you've kind of always said, you know, who's going to be there to <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12862.587s">I'm</a>  trying. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12864.268s">But</a>  like I said, we can disagree on politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12867.97s">We</a>  can disagree on all these things in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12871.092s">But</a>  when it comes to things like this, this is something we can all agree on, that we can all come together and smile and be happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12879.777s">And</a>  for a couple hours, go out and watch this team play and just be all proud that we're all from Medford.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12895.168s">We're</a>  all together as Mustangs supporting our team. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12902.531s">So,</a>  Nicole, I'll even buy a baby a nice little outfit, a little Mustang outfit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12907.634s">Chris,</a>  if you can.</p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12909.195s">One</a>  of the big reasons I still do it, my kids love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12915.978s">My</a>  four-year-old is, I'll pick him up from preschool. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12918.539s">We're</a>  going to feed the football team today. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12921.923s">I'm</a>  like, like we just don't feed them every day.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12925.465s">I</a>  mean, we did have cancer saying, I'll go back to cancer.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12929.306s">I'll</a>  be quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12930.206s">Um,</a>  as a, as a high grad, I am so ready for this match. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12934.908s">Uh,</a>  I'm just so ready for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12937.989s">I,</a>  I, I, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12939.73s">I,</a>  you, you mentioned the record this year, but every time I go on Twitter and I see, um, uh, MHS athletics tweet out the results of how our, how our kids are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12949.273s">You</a>  know, it just makes me so proud to be from this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12952.556s">And</a>  I think we talk a lot, we're always proud of you all and proud of your kids and the service they give back to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12959.482s">But,</a>  you know, we're always talking about what we can do to make, you know, make people more proud of Medford, make people more united in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12967.649s">And</a>  as you said it, as my fellow councillors have said it, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12971.692s">You</a>  know, our football team is really, really shining the way right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12976.193s">And</a>  just wanted to give you my thanks, my support, and go Mustangs.</p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12980.734s">Real</a>  quick, seven Boston Globe Player of the Week weeks this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12984.915s">Seven.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12985.335s">So...</a>  Councilor Caraviello, and then I'm just going in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12989.336s">Who</a>  cares about football more? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12990.376s">Then</a>  we'll go to you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12992.316s">Thank</a>  you, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12993.877s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=12996.817s">You</a>  know, George and I come from a different generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13001.806s">Sports</a>  was a big part of your high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13005.888s">It</a>  developed pride in your high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13007.93s">It</a>  was pride in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13011.172s">The</a>  city of Medford, we were a football town forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13016.375s">During</a>  my high school years, we used to go to the away games with like four buses of kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13020.917s">I</a>  mean, you went, if you were a high school student, you went to the football game on Saturday afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13027.661s">Thanksgiving</a>  day, <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13029.576s">God</a>  couldn't get a ticket on some years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13032.558s">You</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13033.899s">The</a>  lines used to be around the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13035.52s">People</a>  waiting for tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13037.862s">Thanksgiving</a>  Day used to sell out weeks before the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13041.405s">And</a>  that was not the pride of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13044.687s">It</a>  was our football team, our sports teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13049.067s">We</a>  were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13050.108s">That's</a>  what kids went to the school for. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13052.87s">And</a>  that's part of the reason our teams have faltered over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13058.053s">And</a>  that's why you're seeing a lot of kids going to different schools now, because we have to get that pride back. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13065.539s">It</a>  was there when I was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13067.52s">It</a>  was there when George was there, when we were dominating teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13070.742s">And</a>  you wanted to go to the games. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13073.444s">You</a>  went to the hockey games. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13074.425s">You</a>  went to the base. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13075.506s">You</a>  went to games. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13077.355s">Yeah,</a>  you don't forget the 90s with that soccer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13081.478s">Yeah,</a>  there was some guy that was on the team, I don't forget his name.</p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13084.561s">I'll</a>  tell you what, this guy over here, Councilor Scarpelli, was big in the early 2000s for getting us to go to each other's games. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13095.55s">I</a>  went to soccer games in cities I didn't know existed to go watch Georgia's teams play.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13102.995s">There</a>  was nothing better than listening to a group of Brazilian kids screaming defense while the offense was on the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13108.139s">There</a>  was nothing better than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13110.861s">We</a>  have other things we should celebrate, but we should be celebrating <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13114.503s">The</a>  fact that our marching band won the championship and came in this community, I love the fact that they had the police escorts come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13122.57s">These</a>  are things we should be celebrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13124.032s">We</a>  have so many great things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13125.213s">This</a>  is what elevates us. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13127.715s">Thanksgiving</a>  is a good start.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13131.38s">I</a>  was just about to bring up that about 15 years ago was when I picked up a sousaphone and played the fight song for the first time. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13139.946s">And</a>  I would challenge anyone here to sing the, you know, we don't all know the lyrics, but I can sing you the fight song right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13148.071s">It's</a>  playing in my head.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13149.832s">I</a>  have it right here for everybody.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13152.547s">See,</a>  I was playing an instrument. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13159.754s">It's</a>  the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13160.515s">But</a>  I just want to put out there, and Nicole, President Morell's losing a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13165.039s">You</a>  have a baby at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13166.0s">Let's</a>  keep talking.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13166.741s">It's</a>  public participation, I guess.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13169.924s">public</a>  participation.</p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13171.645s">I'm</a>  glad that I've seen probably more smiles on all your faces tonight.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13178.09s">So</a>  you know, it was worth it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13182.993s">But</a>  I just want to say to that 15 years ago was the first time I played it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13186.576s">And</a>  if this season's team has broken my 15 year curse, I'm very much appreciative of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13192.04s">So</a>  thank you guys so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13194.041s">And</a>  thank you, Chris.</p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13196.323s">It's</a>  funny. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13197.704s">You</a>  know, it's I tell the kids, it's <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13201.052s">It's</a>  great to win games, but there's nothing like beating Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13205.319s">Nothing.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13206.501s">I</a>  mean... Onward, mighty Mustangs! <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13210.487s">Our</a>  hopes are pinned on you!</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13213.632s">We'll</a>  stampede the foe as onward we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13217.173s">Onward</a>  to victory. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13219.814s">Go,</a>  go, go. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13221.295s">Onward,</a>  mighty Mustangs. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13223.876s">We</a>  want a touchdown, hear our cry. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13226.997s">Our</a>  galloping on to victory for Medford High. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13233.879s">How</a>  do you like that?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13235.98s">How</a>  do you like that?</p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13243.467s">With</a>  the exception of the time I might've sang that with Bishop Irwin at my confirmation. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13248.231s">This</a>  is probably the best rendition I've ever had of the song.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13252.054s">I</a>  guess it's not coming in more often. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13256.338s">Chris,</a>  there should be something recognizing our Super Bowl team there at Hormel.</p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13266.403s">I</a>  would like to tear the whole complex down and build it up and do something nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13271.387s">But</a>  yeah, there should definitely be something for your uncle there.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13274.069s">Yeah,</a>  there should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13275.39s">Something</a>  to recognize in the team.</p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13277.011s">We'll</a>  work on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13278.472s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13279.453s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Chris Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13280.193s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13281.294s">I</a>  know you all have families. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13282.955s">I'm</a>  gonna go home and get yelled at.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13285.257s">Thank</a>  you, Chris.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13287.608s">Motion</a>  to adjourn. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13288.269s">Second</a>  by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13289.111s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13289.572s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13289.812s">Opposed?</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13292.056s">Motion</a>  passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/3gvhm0AovZU&t=13292.897s">Meeting</a>  adjourned.</p>
