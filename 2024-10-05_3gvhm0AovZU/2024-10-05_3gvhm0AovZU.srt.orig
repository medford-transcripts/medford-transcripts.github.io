100
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:54,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, hi, National Grid is intending to place three conduits down Main Street

101
00:05:54,763 --> 00:06:00,544
[SPEAKER_08]: and approximately right in front of the fire station, down beyond the medical building, attaching two manholes together.

102
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:03,625
[SPEAKER_08]: This will allow us to place a new piece of cable.

103
00:06:04,445 --> 00:06:07,986
[SPEAKER_08]: The existing infrastructure that is there is no longer usable.

104
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:08,726
[SPEAKER_08]: It's collapsed.

105
00:06:09,106 --> 00:06:10,267
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't get our cable through.

106
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:14,128
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're intending to place a new conduit down through that area.

107
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:15,688
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

108
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,209
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

109
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:19,429
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

110
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:21,289
[SPEAKER_36]: What time of day will this work be?

111
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:23,790
[SPEAKER_36]: You can determine that.

112
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:35,212
[SPEAKER_36]: okay so we can do something at night because right now that area is a mess traffic wise so and the last piece I know maybe the city engineer the paving was that going to be curb to curb?

113
00:06:37,915 --> 00:06:45,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Working with Owen we're our intention right there is to do the bike lane portion of that and

114
00:06:46,117 --> 00:06:51,421
[SPEAKER_08]: we are going to be responsible for the entire square footage of the curb to curb paving.

115
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:54,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that could be done anywhere else in the city.

116
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:55,664
[SPEAKER_08]: That was the intention.

117
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:57,485
[SPEAKER_36]: So we'll be done curb to curb.

118
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:03,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, that particular area will be, um, the bike lane, the distance of the bike lane, approximately three ft.

119
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:10,635
[SPEAKER_08]: So we won't go all the way curb to curb in that area, not to just to keep that a narrower excavation trench.

120
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:18,214
[SPEAKER_08]: But in place of doing the curb to curb that we are responsible for, we will do that in another area of the city.

121
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:20,614
[SPEAKER_42]: City engineer.

122
00:07:21,414 --> 00:07:25,455
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, if you want to come up, you can explain that.

123
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:25,915
[SPEAKER_42]: Thanks, sir.

124
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:26,815
[SPEAKER_42]: I appreciate that.

125
00:07:26,856 --> 00:07:28,056
[SPEAKER_42]: I just didn't hear perhaps.

126
00:07:29,096 --> 00:07:32,597
[SPEAKER_41]: So, hi, I'm Owen were tell a city hall.

127
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:41,672
[SPEAKER_41]: We have discussed this with National Grid about the restoration limits going curb to curb.

128
00:07:42,152 --> 00:07:51,379
[SPEAKER_41]: Once we've just repaved it seemed that it could be more problematic in that scenario where they could undermine what we just did.

129
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:53,160
[SPEAKER_41]: So we limited it

130
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:05,525
[SPEAKER_41]: the restoration to the bike lane so that they could do a saw cut line on the paint line, and then it would seal the seam and then come back through and do the painting of the bike lane and milling and paving in that area.

131
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:17,649
[SPEAKER_36]: Okay, but are we now in the practice, because it's great news if it is, but that now our public utilities that come in to open up our streets, it'll be curb to curb like we do with the private entities as well?

132
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,190
[SPEAKER_41]: That is normally the case, yes.

133
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,570
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

134
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,371
[SPEAKER_24]: All right, that's great.

135
00:08:21,771 --> 00:08:21,991
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

136
00:08:22,998 --> 00:08:24,799
[SPEAKER_24]: If I could just engineer we're tall.

137
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,399
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

138
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:39,144
[SPEAKER_24]: And my understanding is in this case because it's brand new In this case we would feel that going milling curb to curb right would undermine what we've just Right, right.

139
00:08:39,224 --> 00:08:40,025
[SPEAKER_24]: So you're gonna do that.

140
00:08:40,085 --> 00:08:46,587
[SPEAKER_24]: But then the square footage that they otherwise would have been responsible for we're gonna get repaid somewhere else I'd love to take it if we can Elm Street

141
00:08:51,873 --> 00:08:53,714
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

142
00:08:53,754 --> 00:08:53,894
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

143
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:57,936
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to make sure, cause that sounds like it, that should be, that seems fair to me.

144
00:08:58,196 --> 00:08:58,416
[SPEAKER_24]: So.

145
00:08:59,937 --> 00:09:03,699
[SPEAKER_22]: I, there was a point in here about sidewalks.

146
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:11,163
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to make sure that when we redo the sidewalks that we're doing them with concrete and not asphalt, I see.

147
00:09:12,043 --> 00:09:13,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

148
00:09:13,664 --> 00:09:15,305
[SPEAKER_08]: We should have like for like, they are concrete.

149
00:09:15,325 --> 00:09:16,726
[SPEAKER_08]: They will be returned as concrete.

150
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:17,226
[SPEAKER_36]: Great.

151
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:17,746
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

152
00:09:17,986 --> 00:09:19,587
[SPEAKER_36]: Now, if I can, while the engine is here.

153
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,491
[SPEAKER_36]: How long, again, will the process take for this project?

154
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:29,054
[SPEAKER_08]: We're anticipating approximately one week of completion.

155
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:29,894
[SPEAKER_36]: All right.

156
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:35,237
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think that two reasons for the question, that area is a mess.

157
00:09:35,257 --> 00:09:36,077
[SPEAKER_36]: I think we all know that.

158
00:09:37,218 --> 00:09:42,000
[SPEAKER_36]: Now that it's all right turns there, I mean, that area's just flooded in the morning now.

159
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:46,523
[SPEAKER_36]: This could be something done at night with the city's request.

160
00:09:46,623 --> 00:09:48,484
[SPEAKER_36]: Is there a better time to do it?

161
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:50,505
[SPEAKER_41]: It would be at the discretion of the mayor.

162
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:53,479
[SPEAKER_36]: Police, okay.

163
00:09:53,499 --> 00:09:58,082
[SPEAKER_41]: All right, we'll have that conversation.

164
00:09:59,023 --> 00:10:02,045
[SPEAKER_36]: For safety reasons, we would defer to the traffic sergeants.

165
00:10:02,906 --> 00:10:16,455
[SPEAKER_36]: And that's something that if we can, as part of the record, we'll reach out as part of a motion to reach out to the chief of police to request their thoughts.

166
00:10:18,276 --> 00:10:20,258
[SPEAKER_36]: And if it's not that we have

167
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:24,790
[SPEAKER_36]: a detailed informational plan that goes out to our residents.

168
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,414
[SPEAKER_36]: And just because that, I take that, I think everybody knows that trip.

169
00:10:30,494 --> 00:10:37,279
[SPEAKER_36]: We've heard phone calls and emails from multiple residents about that right turn only being a major change.

170
00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:45,245
[SPEAKER_36]: And then if you drive through Memphis Square, now you see why, but I think that making sure that everybody's informed of what happens if it does happen during the day.

171
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:47,306
[SPEAKER_36]: But thank you, ma'am.

172
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:47,566
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

173
00:10:47,586 --> 00:10:48,667
[SPEAKER_42]: Would you like to make that a P paper?

174
00:10:48,707 --> 00:10:49,328
[SPEAKER_42]: Please, if you can.

175
00:10:50,788 --> 00:10:52,328
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Behrs.

176
00:10:52,348 --> 00:10:53,389
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

177
00:10:53,529 --> 00:11:01,571
[SPEAKER_24]: An engineer should we amend the conditions here to reflect the additional paving that we were just so graciously told that the National Grid would like?

178
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:05,351
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you have suggestions we amend number five to reflect that?

179
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:06,472
[SPEAKER_24]: Do you feel like we need to change?

180
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:07,392
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

181
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:08,452
[SPEAKER_39]: I have a suggestion.

182
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:10,032
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm here for questions.

183
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:11,073
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, great.

184
00:11:11,173 --> 00:11:11,533
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

185
00:11:12,953 --> 00:11:13,493
[SPEAKER_42]: Any other questions?

186
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:16,334
[SPEAKER_42]: We do have to open the hearing to any other questions for councilors at this time.

187
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:30,032
[SPEAKER_24]: Just I would move to amend condition five to reflect that National Grid will, you know, pave another portion of road in the city based on the square footage of what they would have paved curb to curb.

188
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:34,616
[SPEAKER_42]: Should we take that now before we open up the public hearing or after?

189
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:40,649
[SPEAKER_42]: I'll take the motion now.

190
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:51,698
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have a motion from Vice Mayor Behrs to amend condition number five to reflect the curb-to-curb paving that will be done in another part of the city in lieu of this specific parcel.

191
00:11:52,658 --> 00:11:54,200
[SPEAKER_42]: Seconded by Councilor Sang.

192
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,961
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

193
00:12:02,506 --> 00:12:04,208
[SPEAKER_42]: And then, while he's writing that down,

194
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:12,924
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have a policy ordinance in the city as far as not reopening our streets again right after we paved them.

195
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:13,784
[SPEAKER_42]: It's five years, right?

196
00:12:14,524 --> 00:12:20,806
[SPEAKER_42]: Is this because this infrastructure has collapsed and this is considered an emergency or just because it's a public utility?

197
00:12:21,927 --> 00:12:23,007
[SPEAKER_42]: How is this occurring, I guess?

198
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:32,271
[SPEAKER_41]: I would recommend that council asks National Grid why this is considered an emergency work 16 months after the case.

199
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,231
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

200
00:12:34,296 --> 00:12:34,936
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

201
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:36,777
[SPEAKER_42]: Could you tell us why this is considered?

202
00:12:37,097 --> 00:12:42,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's we've been working through multiple permitting issues trying to accomplish this.

203
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,300
[SPEAKER_08]: So it did take some time to start that whole process.

204
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,341
[SPEAKER_42]: So yeah, you would have done this earlier.

205
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:49,702
[SPEAKER_08]: We would have done this early.

206
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:50,942
[SPEAKER_08]: That's that's correct.

207
00:12:51,342 --> 00:12:51,562
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

208
00:12:52,262 --> 00:12:52,563
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

209
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:58,345
[SPEAKER_42]: Um, so, Mr. Clerk, call the roll on the motion from vice bears to amend condition five.

210
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:00,746
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

211
00:13:05,501 --> 00:13:05,842
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

212
00:13:08,225 --> 00:13:08,606
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

213
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:11,089
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

214
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:11,590
[SPEAKER_42]: Seven.

215
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,331
[SPEAKER_42]: The affirmative.

216
00:13:12,351 --> 00:13:12,551
[SPEAKER_42]: Negative.

217
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:14,755
[SPEAKER_42]: The motion passes to five.

218
00:13:15,275 --> 00:13:16,918
[SPEAKER_42]: Any further questions from the counselors at this time?

219
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:20,631
[SPEAKER_42]: As this is a public hearing, I need to open up the hearing.

220
00:13:20,711 --> 00:13:26,535
[SPEAKER_42]: So if there is anyone who would like to speak in favor of this paper, please come to the mic or raise your hand on Zoom.

221
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:30,518
[SPEAKER_42]: Our friends from National Grid, that would be you as far as speaking in favor of this.

222
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:31,899
[SPEAKER_42]: Are you in favor of this paper?

223
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:33,360
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in favor of this paper, thank you.

224
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:33,880
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

225
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,262
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this paper?

226
00:13:37,963 --> 00:13:39,444
[SPEAKER_42]: Seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

227
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:44,027
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone who would like to speak against in opposition of this paper?

228
00:13:44,047 --> 00:13:46,209
[SPEAKER_42]: Please come up to the mic or raise your hand on Zoom.

229
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:53,882
[SPEAKER_42]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

230
00:13:54,782 --> 00:13:58,444
[SPEAKER_42]: We do have a B paper I can take and then I'll see if there's a motion we want to make.

231
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:00,464
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have a B paper from Councillor Scarpelli.

232
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:04,786
[SPEAKER_42]: Do you have the language for that?

233
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:07,967
[SPEAKER_42]: Could you read it back?

234
00:14:07,987 --> 00:14:14,030
[SPEAKER_38]: Councillor Scarpelli's B paper is to

235
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:24,680
[SPEAKER_38]: ask the chief of police for his thoughts on this matter, and then to get a detailed information plan to go out to residents.

236
00:14:26,422 --> 00:14:26,602
[SPEAKER_42]: Right.

237
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:27,403
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

238
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:30,587
[SPEAKER_42]: So on the motion on the B paper from Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by?

258
00:15:21,768 --> 00:15:22,028
[SPEAKER_46]: Yes.

259
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:25,732
Yes.

260
00:15:27,073 --> 00:15:27,333
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

261
00:15:30,376 --> 00:15:30,617
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

262
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:31,718
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:32,158
[SPEAKER_42]: Seven.

[SPEAKER_42]: The affirmative zero and the negative passes.

265
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:35,421
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you very much.

266
00:15:37,664 --> 00:15:39,866
[SPEAKER_42]: Going to two three dash four five zero.

267
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:55,598
[SPEAKER_42]: 23-450 offered by President Morrell, Vice President Behrs, and Councilor Carviello.

268
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:07,645
[SPEAKER_42]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Elections Commission and Elections Manager provide a report to the Council listing any and all issues or procedural errors that occurred during the administration of the 2023 municipal election.

269
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:18,753
[SPEAKER_42]: Be it further resolved that the report includes specific responses to, one, the misprinting of ballots, two, the inaccurate instruction sheets provided to voters with mail ballots, three, the trainings that provided incorrect information to poll wardens,

270
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:28,996
[SPEAKER_42]: and workers regarding voters bringing materials to assist them in the voting booth, and four, persistent issues with the counting of ballots in a timely manner and release of incomplete, unofficial election results to the public.

271
00:16:29,576 --> 00:16:35,598
[SPEAKER_42]: For the result, the mayor provided the council with a supplemental appropriation request to restore the full-time staffing levels in the election department.

272
00:16:35,618 --> 00:16:36,978
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Behrs.

273
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:42,180
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam President, could we read Councillor Scarpelli's paper and join it with this one?

274
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:52,341
[SPEAKER_42]: Do we have to take a roll call on that?

275
00:16:52,401 --> 00:16:57,124
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have a motion for Vice-President Behrs to join 23-450 and 23-451.

276
00:16:57,164 --> 00:16:59,566
[SPEAKER_42]: Seconded by Councillor Scarpelli.

277
00:16:59,906 --> 00:17:02,468
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll and this is the roll to join them.

278
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:04,169
[SPEAKER_42]: And then I'll read the 23-451 next.

279
00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:12,515
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice-President Behrs.

280
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:12,835
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

281
00:17:13,536 --> 00:17:14,076
[SPEAKER_39]: Councillor Kerrio.

282
00:17:14,216 --> 00:17:14,437
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

283
00:17:14,597 --> 00:17:15,958
[SPEAKER_39]: Councillor Collins.

284
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:16,138
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

285
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:21,339
[SPEAKER_39]: How's the fight?

286
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:21,880
[SPEAKER_39]: You're up.

287
00:17:22,662 --> 00:17:22,882
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

288
00:17:29,544 --> 00:17:35,089
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, some of the inferiors do the negative motion passes, the papers are joined, going two, two, three, four, five, one offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

289
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:46,400
[SPEAKER_42]: Be it resolved that the election coordinator report back to the city council with a detailed report and findings detailing the municipal election, which includes, but is not limited to absentee ballots, polling rules and regulations and complaints and malfunction.

290
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:48,422
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'm going to go on order as far as the names of the papers.

291
00:17:48,462 --> 00:17:51,345
[SPEAKER_42]: So the vice mayors, Councilor Carbello, Councilor Scarpelli.

292
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,026
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

293
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:57,581
[SPEAKER_24]: I could go through everything, but then I would leave nothing for my fellow councillors.

294
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:17,696
[SPEAKER_24]: But there was a litany of procedural errors and issues with the administration of this election, many of which I personally believe would not have occurred had the department been fully funded as this council requested and had the department not had staff turnover as this council also requested.

295
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:27,132
[SPEAKER_24]: There's a listing here, the ones that I really want to bring to light right now that I'm sure my fellow councillors will talk about other issues.

296
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:40,135
[SPEAKER_24]: Last election, November 2022, the state election, the city also released incomplete, unofficial results that did not include, to my knowledge, early in mail voting.

297
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:47,996
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if that's what happened last Tuesday, but incomplete, unofficial results were once again released to the public.

298
00:18:49,438 --> 00:18:53,220
[SPEAKER_24]: We had been told, as we asked for an update on the previous election, that this would be fixed.

299
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,401
[SPEAKER_24]: It was clearly not fixed.

300
00:18:56,423 --> 00:19:04,786
[SPEAKER_24]: folks were here for up to at least four hours after polls had closed, maybe even longer than that, trying to fix an issue that shouldn't have been an issue.

301
00:19:05,006 --> 00:19:16,731
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to put that out there that left a lot of folks in the community concerned about how ballots are being counted, etc., having a complete tally and accurate unofficial results.

302
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:19,792
[SPEAKER_24]: I also just want to put out there that

303
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:25,711
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, incorrect information was given to voters both by mail and at polling locations.

304
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:32,775
[SPEAKER_24]: Incorrect information as to the date that mail ballots should be returned and a sheet went out that was for the previous year's election.

305
00:19:33,514 --> 00:19:34,515
[SPEAKER_24]: That should not have happened.

306
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:43,999
[SPEAKER_24]: And folks were being told that they could not bring materials into the booths to assist them or provide guidance to them while they were voting.

307
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:45,780
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's against the state voter bill of rights.

308
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:49,122
[SPEAKER_24]: So again, that's just a couple of the things that I want to bring to bear.

309
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:51,163
[SPEAKER_24]: I know other folks have other things they want to bring to bear.

310
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:56,985
[SPEAKER_24]: I just think it is a serious issue when we need.

311
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:02,228
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't believe that any of these issues resulted in an outcome.

312
00:20:02,789 --> 00:20:04,850
[SPEAKER_24]: that is different from what the outcome should have been.

313
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,893
[SPEAKER_24]: However, we need to have beyond reproach trust in the process.

314
00:20:10,933 --> 00:20:12,273
[SPEAKER_24]: You can't have mistakes like this.

315
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:19,816
[SPEAKER_24]: You certainly can't have series of mistakes and errors like this because perception is reality to a lot of folks.

316
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:23,718
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's going to be people who won't believe anything that I'm saying forever about this.

317
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:25,439
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's a shame.

318
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:32,422
[SPEAKER_24]: We need to have full trust of as many people as possible in this community and the absolute

319
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:39,035
[SPEAKER_24]: and unimpeachable integrity of the electoral process and errors like these hurt that mission.

320
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,278
[SPEAKER_24]: So I hope that we will get

321
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:49,717
[SPEAKER_24]: very quick guidance and explanation as to why things happen the way they happen, and quite frankly, very quick action from the mayor to make sure that they don't happen again.

322
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:57,583
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that action needs to come, not just in reporting to us what went wrong and how they're gonna do better next time, because that's what they did last time.

323
00:20:58,023 --> 00:21:01,066
[SPEAKER_24]: We got a report about how we're gonna do better, and then a lot of the same things happened again.

324
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:07,430
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's an office that needs to be funded and needs to be staffed appropriately so that you don't have errors like this occurring.

325
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,331
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

326
00:21:10,661 --> 00:21:11,822
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam President.

327
00:21:14,645 --> 00:21:15,806
[SPEAKER_21]: I think Councillor Baird is right.

328
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:20,189
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not here disputing the results of the election.

329
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:21,290
[SPEAKER_21]: They are what they are.

330
00:21:22,952 --> 00:21:27,596
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's the integrity of the office that's the question here.

331
00:21:28,637 --> 00:21:31,479
[SPEAKER_21]: And this isn't a question just for MEDFED.

332
00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:34,682
[SPEAKER_21]: This is why throughout the whole country

333
00:21:35,467 --> 00:21:40,909
[SPEAKER_21]: We're seeing people losing faith in elections by exactly what happened in our city.

334
00:21:41,829 --> 00:21:43,670
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not a Trump thing or a thing.

335
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:52,093
[SPEAKER_21]: But again, I was a full supporter of bringing in an election coordinator because I thought we would do a better job.

336
00:21:52,994 --> 00:21:54,434
[SPEAKER_21]: And the job has gotten worse.

337
00:21:57,555 --> 00:22:01,517
[SPEAKER_21]: If I had to do that vote over again, I would have probably left to keep it in the hands of the clerk.

338
00:22:01,997 --> 00:22:04,738
[SPEAKER_21]: Because when the clerk ran the elections in prior years,

339
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:07,961
[SPEAKER_21]: We've never, ever had these kinds of issues.

340
00:22:08,601 --> 00:22:13,126
[SPEAKER_21]: People sitting here till 1 o'clock in the morning, waiting for ballots, waiting for questions.

341
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:17,169
[SPEAKER_21]: You had tapes that didn't add up to the results that were posted.

342
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:22,074
[SPEAKER_21]: Numerous, numerous errors, like Councilor Beall said, dating back to,

343
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:27,289
[SPEAKER_21]: printing of the ballots, wrong instructions.

344
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:38,738
[SPEAKER_21]: People get, I don't know how our computer system allowed us to print out three and four ballots per person, per household in different wards.

345
00:22:38,818 --> 00:22:41,941
[SPEAKER_21]: I came in here with a stack of eight ballots in one house.

346
00:22:43,402 --> 00:22:44,323
[SPEAKER_21]: How does that happen?

347
00:22:45,123 --> 00:22:51,409
[SPEAKER_21]: We have no idea how many of those ballots were sitting out there with no accountability.

348
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:52,590
[SPEAKER_21]: How many ballots did we print?

349
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,991
[SPEAKER_21]: How many ballots are left over now?

350
00:22:54,887 --> 00:23:02,989
[SPEAKER_21]: again, counting ballots that were supposed to be in public.

351
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:04,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Those things just shouldn't happen.

352
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:15,153
[SPEAKER_21]: And I say, and this is the reason people don't want to come out and vote, not just in here, but throughout the country, because of the integrity of what goes on here.

353
00:23:15,533 --> 00:23:21,615
[SPEAKER_21]: We've investigated people in this building, the lesser things, I think,

354
00:23:23,003 --> 00:23:35,012
[SPEAKER_21]: Some sort of outside audit needs to be done to find out why these mistakes occurred again and again, especially when Secretary of State's called you in the morning of that election telling you were doing things wrong.

355
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:39,855
[SPEAKER_21]: And after they hung up on you, your people went back and said, don't listen to what they told you.

356
00:23:40,075 --> 00:23:41,176
[SPEAKER_21]: You do what I tell you to do.

357
00:23:41,677 --> 00:23:44,038
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not how this process is supposed to work.

358
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:45,339
[SPEAKER_21]: So be fair and equal to everybody.

359
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,081
[SPEAKER_21]: You shouldn't be telling people who to vote for in elections.

360
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:49,522
[SPEAKER_21]: You shouldn't be telling people what

361
00:23:51,195 --> 00:23:52,135
[SPEAKER_21]: What kind of materials?

362
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:57,737
[SPEAKER_21]: If somebody wants to bring something in their pocket with them, then they're allowed to do it, as long as it's not open to the public.

363
00:23:58,677 --> 00:24:01,077
[SPEAKER_21]: We had improper training of the officials here.

364
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,178
[SPEAKER_21]: We were understaffed at the polls.

365
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:08,299
[SPEAKER_21]: Every election, we always had someone checking in and out.

366
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:09,699
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not the process anymore.

367
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,960
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I'm not disputing the results.

368
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,001
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not saying they would have changed.

369
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:18,401
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just disputing the integrity of the office.

370
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:29,454
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Madam President.

371
00:24:29,494 --> 00:24:32,336
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you, Councilor Baez and Councilor Carviello.

372
00:24:32,456 --> 00:24:35,418
[SPEAKER_36]: I think that my frustration is what's felt throughout the community.

373
00:24:35,918 --> 00:24:44,123
[SPEAKER_36]: You said something very important because what bothered me more than anything in this time in our country, you want people to get involved.

374
00:24:44,423 --> 00:24:47,745
[SPEAKER_36]: And I had five to six people call me and say, you know what?

375
00:24:48,426 --> 00:24:50,467
[SPEAKER_36]: I'll never, ever vote.

376
00:24:52,907 --> 00:24:55,229
[SPEAKER_36]: in an election for the city ever again.

377
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,532
[SPEAKER_36]: I'll leave my vote just the national agenda and that's it.

378
00:24:58,552 --> 00:25:00,713
[SPEAKER_36]: Because that's how disgusted they are.

379
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:03,155
[SPEAKER_36]: And I can see why, being part of it.

380
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:07,699
[SPEAKER_36]: This is, and I'll give you an example.

381
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,262
[SPEAKER_36]: Councilor Carvillo did, in running his election.

382
00:25:12,002 --> 00:25:17,026
[SPEAKER_36]: He was honest, he was fair, he worked hard, and he asked volunteers to come out.

383
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:22,642
[SPEAKER_36]: And those volunteers came out to assist, like any candidate could.

384
00:25:23,242 --> 00:25:25,323
[SPEAKER_36]: Any candidate could have done what Councilor Carviello did.

385
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:29,645
[SPEAKER_36]: Now, it didn't come out in his favor, and that's life.

386
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:43,113
[SPEAKER_36]: But to hear the horrific issues that poll workers were put in, and the poll watchers, so people don't know,

387
00:25:44,954 --> 00:25:47,895
[SPEAKER_36]: you're allowed to have poll watchers, and it's a machine.

388
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:49,335
[SPEAKER_36]: So the poll watchers go out.

389
00:25:49,375 --> 00:26:02,480
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a calculated strategy where they're allowed to have poll watchers sit in a relatively close area that you can hear and see the process.

390
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,481
[SPEAKER_36]: The process is very simple, that the poll watchers

391
00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:11,770
[SPEAKER_36]: There was talk that they were told they can't sit down.

392
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,612
[SPEAKER_36]: Then they were told they can't sit down if they bring their own seats.

393
00:26:16,072 --> 00:26:17,854
[SPEAKER_36]: And if that's the case, OK, bring your own seat.

394
00:26:18,434 --> 00:26:19,755
[SPEAKER_36]: Pole watchers sat in their seats.

395
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:24,298
[SPEAKER_36]: And then they were told to move 25 feet away.

396
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,014
[SPEAKER_36]: And then the process was very simple.

397
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:48,660
[SPEAKER_36]: The process that by law states, in the general laws that we had attorneys pass out to each polling station, each warden, and it said straight out, the process is such, when the person approaches to vote, if they have a license or not,

398
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:51,028
[SPEAKER_36]: because we had the new scanning system.

399
00:26:51,388 --> 00:27:03,651
[SPEAKER_36]: And believe me, I do not blame the poll, the workers that are at the poll, I don't blame them, because a lot of them are great people and they just weren't prepared, but they had the licenses.

400
00:27:03,671 --> 00:27:08,592
[SPEAKER_36]: They have the license, you're supposed to sweep their name and address.

401
00:27:08,612 --> 00:27:16,814
[SPEAKER_36]: They're supposed to say, George Scott Pelley, 27 Butler Street, and the poll worker responds back, George Scott Pelley, correct.

402
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:21,384
[SPEAKER_36]: for the purpose of clarity and transparency.

403
00:27:22,105 --> 00:27:29,657
[SPEAKER_36]: And then what they do is that person has a book, same as the workers do, and they check off who comes in and votes.

404
00:27:30,632 --> 00:27:37,299
[SPEAKER_36]: And then if you have a machine that works for you, volunteers that want to work for you, you then have people pick up those books every two to four hours.

405
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:44,586
[SPEAKER_36]: And then you have people in offices or at homes calling people and saying, hey, we see you haven't voted today.

406
00:27:45,047 --> 00:27:45,907
[SPEAKER_36]: Do you need a ride?

407
00:27:46,328 --> 00:27:46,948
[SPEAKER_36]: It's a machine.

408
00:27:47,008 --> 00:27:48,230
[SPEAKER_36]: It's done all over the country.

409
00:27:49,869 --> 00:28:01,117
[SPEAKER_36]: What we saw this past Tuesday, I'm not even gonna bring up a formal, maybe I will, because I said what happened before, I said, please, this is why this country is such a mess.

410
00:28:02,778 --> 00:28:06,880
[SPEAKER_36]: Conspiracy theories through the roof, and I'm not a conspiracy theorist, I hate it.

411
00:28:07,781 --> 00:28:16,167
[SPEAKER_36]: And what happened this past week and the weeks before this and understanding how this process went was a disgrace.

412
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:19,559
[SPEAKER_36]: How much money did we lose?

413
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:33,965
[SPEAKER_36]: When you don't open up the boxes of the ballots to a few days before you have to mail out the mailing ballots, and you realize you have someone's name spelt wrong, so they have to be thrown away.

414
00:28:34,745 --> 00:28:39,487
[SPEAKER_36]: Now you have to get ballots reprinted and rushed in, which is thousands of dollars.

415
00:28:40,848 --> 00:28:48,751
[SPEAKER_36]: And then they go out and then we realize that we're getting phone calls from Ward 6 saying everybody that ordered, that requested four ballots got eight.

416
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:50,752
[SPEAKER_36]: Everybody that got asked for two got four.

417
00:28:51,112 --> 00:28:52,533
[SPEAKER_36]: Everybody asked for three got six.

418
00:28:53,613 --> 00:29:00,296
[SPEAKER_36]: And then we had to reassure the public that even though it looks bad, they cannot vote three to six times.

419
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:02,417
[SPEAKER_36]: And we said that day,

420
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,291
[SPEAKER_36]: that meeting before the election, please.

421
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:08,453
[SPEAKER_36]: If it's because you're understaffed, ask for help.

422
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:14,758
[SPEAKER_36]: If we have to approve anything from this council to assist, bring in a thousand people from the state, whoever you need to assist.

423
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:19,742
[SPEAKER_36]: Now, Councilor Caballero's team was very proactive.

424
00:29:21,603 --> 00:29:28,047
[SPEAKER_36]: I know for sure, because my wife was one of the poll watchers, that at her location, she showed up at seven where polls open, correct?

425
00:29:28,728 --> 00:29:31,250
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, at 7.30, they still weren't ready to go.

426
00:29:32,736 --> 00:29:36,297
[SPEAKER_36]: Then we heard some places that we had machines that weren't working.

427
00:29:37,438 --> 00:29:46,901
[SPEAKER_36]: By law, when you test a machine, the notice has to go out to the public and it has to be done in an open process.

428
00:29:47,841 --> 00:29:51,302
[SPEAKER_36]: Before the election, that process has to be open to the public.

429
00:29:51,342 --> 00:29:57,644
[SPEAKER_36]: They come in and you can watch the Elections Commission test the machines.

430
00:29:58,124 --> 00:29:58,844
[SPEAKER_36]: That didn't happen.

431
00:29:59,945 --> 00:30:00,605
[SPEAKER_36]: That didn't happen.

432
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:28,578
[SPEAKER_36]: And then as you went through the whole process, we will tell you that we were given a notice from the election director that said, the votes that were taken, the votes that were taken from early voting and absentee voting will be put through the voting machine here at City Hall at 8.30 in the morning and then posted at eight o'clock here at City Hall.

433
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,300
[SPEAKER_36]: That's a memo

434
00:30:31,616 --> 00:30:35,037
[SPEAKER_36]: that's public that went out to the election officials, elected officials.

435
00:30:36,818 --> 00:30:40,299
[SPEAKER_36]: And then you realize, now you go through the numbers.

436
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:44,821
[SPEAKER_36]: You sit there and you go through the numbers, you have people getting their numbers, and it's a mess.

437
00:30:47,462 --> 00:30:55,465
[SPEAKER_36]: There was talks that people coming back saying that the police were being yelled at by wardens, that ballots were being counted, they didn't understand where the ballots were.

438
00:30:55,805 --> 00:31:00,167
[SPEAKER_36]: We had people here counting ballots without being in public.

439
00:31:03,071 --> 00:31:11,757
[SPEAKER_36]: Now that's, that's, it's, it's not to, it's, it's, it's, is it, does it affect the election?

440
00:31:11,817 --> 00:31:16,841
[SPEAKER_36]: No, I don't think it affects the election, but the perception of it is terrible.

441
00:31:18,082 --> 00:31:27,889
[SPEAKER_36]: And if this happens in any other, any other department, things have to be taken swiftly and quickly and making sure this doesn't happen again.

442
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:30,031
[SPEAKER_36]: So

443
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:46,782
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm gonna ask for, if we can, as a resolution, I would amend the existing paper to ask for our election commissioner, our election director, our commission,

444
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:55,843
[SPEAKER_36]: to come before this council to explain in detail what happened.

445
00:31:55,943 --> 00:32:05,388
[SPEAKER_36]: And one of the biggest questions I have from a lot of people that were waiting that night at 835, we had probably between, I believe it was 10,500 votes.

446
00:32:05,408 --> 00:32:06,229
[SPEAKER_36]: And they said, that's it.

447
00:32:10,068 --> 00:32:14,511
[SPEAKER_36]: And we said, wait a second, Medford has never, never been that low.

448
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:17,513
[SPEAKER_36]: What happened to the ballots that were counted in the morning?

449
00:32:17,533 --> 00:32:19,074
[SPEAKER_36]: We don't know what you're talking about.

450
00:32:21,035 --> 00:32:29,721
[SPEAKER_36]: So then all of a sudden at one o'clock in the morning, they posted something that said they found the ballots and it was 4,000 more ballots and this is what it was.

451
00:32:30,421 --> 00:32:31,582
[SPEAKER_36]: Regardless who won, who lost,

452
00:32:32,654 --> 00:32:34,857
[SPEAKER_36]: That just doesn't look good.

453
00:32:35,718 --> 00:32:36,959
[SPEAKER_36]: Perception is reality.

454
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:45,188
[SPEAKER_36]: And this is what, this is the type of situation that brings the fire to the ignorance of our country sometimes.

455
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:47,331
[SPEAKER_36]: And that's what's sad about this.

456
00:32:47,811 --> 00:33:01,501
[SPEAKER_36]: So the reason for this, the reason why I want to move forward and, and get a detailed report, and then ask for, you know, the Secretary of State's office to get involved to them do an audit, because we need answers.

457
00:33:01,581 --> 00:33:07,805
[SPEAKER_36]: So people can understand that your elected officials are holding people accountable when they're not doing their job.

458
00:33:08,145 --> 00:33:09,226
[SPEAKER_36]: So we can squash

459
00:33:09,846 --> 00:33:14,609
[SPEAKER_36]: and move forward for our next elections without any other issues or concerns.

460
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:17,631
[SPEAKER_36]: Because like Councilor Behr said, perception is reality.

461
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:19,812
[SPEAKER_36]: I said it the night, the week before the election.

462
00:33:20,132 --> 00:33:21,253
[SPEAKER_36]: Perception is reality.

463
00:33:21,473 --> 00:33:25,916
[SPEAKER_36]: And what happened is exactly what we would hope, we were scared would happen.

464
00:33:27,157 --> 00:33:33,200
[SPEAKER_36]: Now you have a room full of people that are just as upset because the process was terrible.

465
00:33:34,321 --> 00:33:37,583
[SPEAKER_36]: It was terrible and somebody has to be held accountable, period.

466
00:33:38,872 --> 00:33:44,773
[SPEAKER_36]: Because in my position, if I left a little kid in the park by himself unattended, guess what?

467
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:47,574
[SPEAKER_36]: The next morning, I wouldn't be working.

468
00:33:49,314 --> 00:33:54,475
[SPEAKER_36]: So in the elections department, when you make these many mistakes, something has to be done.

469
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:59,316
[SPEAKER_36]: So Madam President, that's my resolution.

470
00:33:59,456 --> 00:34:01,177
[SPEAKER_36]: I appreciate it and thank you.

471
00:34:01,437 --> 00:34:01,717
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

472
00:34:10,478 --> 00:34:10,898
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor say.

473
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,141
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, President Morrell.

474
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:18,727
[SPEAKER_22]: I think what's been said here really encapsulates what what went wrong process really does matter.

475
00:34:18,747 --> 00:34:24,954
[SPEAKER_22]: Um I think we all agree that the results wouldn't have changed, but the process really doesn't matter.

476
00:34:24,974 --> 00:34:25,554
[SPEAKER_22]: And Councilor

477
00:34:27,156 --> 00:34:30,979
[SPEAKER_22]: Scarpelli is absolutely right when he says that perception is reality.

478
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,681
[SPEAKER_22]: We know that this is a really difficult time for democracy in our country.

479
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:38,063
[SPEAKER_22]: We know that there's a lot of questions about elections.

480
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:42,586
[SPEAKER_22]: And we know that we need to build trust in our election system.

481
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:47,389
[SPEAKER_22]: And that trust, it's not just about trusting the election system.

482
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:50,591
[SPEAKER_22]: It's about having unimpeachable trust in the election system.

483
00:34:52,172 --> 00:34:55,034
[SPEAKER_22]: Elections are the holiest part of our democracy.

484
00:34:56,555 --> 00:34:58,598
[SPEAKER_22]: And our democracy is a sacred system in itself.

485
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:00,582
[SPEAKER_22]: And we need to really we need to defend it.

486
00:35:00,662 --> 00:35:02,244
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to make sure the process works.

487
00:35:04,932 --> 00:35:13,777
[SPEAKER_22]: I, we, you know, we, the other counselors have really, I think, well enumerated the number of issues that we saw before election day and on election day.

488
00:35:14,997 --> 00:35:23,342
[SPEAKER_22]: And we gave, and before this election as well, we gave the administration a fair chance to fix their mistakes.

489
00:35:23,782 --> 00:35:25,463
[SPEAKER_22]: We passed resolutions.

490
00:35:26,603 --> 00:35:27,664
[SPEAKER_22]: We demanded scrutiny.

491
00:35:27,844 --> 00:35:30,765
[SPEAKER_22]: We went through those items line by line.

492
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:33,767
[SPEAKER_22]: We got assurances that they would be fixed for future elections.

493
00:35:34,268 --> 00:35:36,654
[SPEAKER_22]: And we see what the product is today.

494
00:35:36,674 --> 00:35:37,256
[SPEAKER_22]: We need...

495
00:35:38,842 --> 00:35:42,484
[SPEAKER_22]: We need not only to know why what went wrong went wrong.

496
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:46,607
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to know what accountability looks like.

497
00:35:46,787 --> 00:35:48,568
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to demand that accountability as well.

498
00:35:48,968 --> 00:35:58,474
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's good that we've had safeguards in our system to fall back on, like the barcodes that guarantee that each person only has one vote.

499
00:35:59,815 --> 00:36:03,398
[SPEAKER_22]: But we shouldn't have to rely on our safeguards to have faith in our system.

500
00:36:03,598 --> 00:36:06,940
[SPEAKER_22]: We should have faith just because the process has done well.

501
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:23,444
[SPEAKER_22]: and so there's not much I can add on to what's been said because I think what's been said encapsulates pretty well what we need to fix, the accountability we need to demand, but I just wanted to put my thoughts and statements on the record as well.

502
00:36:23,844 --> 00:36:24,444
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Councilor Seng.

503
00:36:24,464 --> 00:36:25,084
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Collins.

504
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:29,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Morrell, and I appreciate the councilors who brought this forward.

505
00:36:29,585 --> 00:36:32,046
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to affirm what all of my colleagues have said so far.

506
00:36:34,146 --> 00:36:36,127
[SPEAKER_16]: It shouldn't need to be restated that

507
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:45,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Our constituency deserves an elections office that is fully equipped at any time to defend full and fair access for every single voter.

508
00:36:46,836 --> 00:36:59,325
[SPEAKER_16]: Individual staff members and volunteers and elected should not be having to fill the gaps or notice gaps or individually lobby or push staff members to do the right thing and correct issues at the 11th hour on election day.

509
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,226
[SPEAKER_16]: But this was the case last Tuesday.

510
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:02,187
[SPEAKER_16]: That was my experience.

511
00:37:02,767 --> 00:37:03,288
[SPEAKER_16]: It's alarming.

512
00:37:04,515 --> 00:37:10,000
[SPEAKER_16]: for anybody who works with City Hall in any capacity as an elected, as an appointed, or as a volunteer.

513
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:14,164
[SPEAKER_16]: That should never be an option, let alone be necessary.

514
00:37:14,184 --> 00:37:26,335
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we all agree if even one voter is unable to cast their ballot because of incorrect mail ballot return information or unable to cast their ballot because they were

515
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,935
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, aspersions were cast about, can I bring my voter guide into the ballot?

516
00:37:31,296 --> 00:37:34,959
[SPEAKER_16]: Or even if that concern is arisen, that concern isn't supposed to happen.

517
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:36,040
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why we have voter rights.

518
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,624
[SPEAKER_16]: That's why they're extremely important in this city, throughout the Commonwealth.

519
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:45,729
[SPEAKER_16]: If we are condoning those issues in our elections office, even for one voter, then we've failed.

520
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,071
[SPEAKER_16]: that's how high of a bar that we have to have for elections.

521
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:57,413
[SPEAKER_16]: As Councillor Scarpelli and others mentioned, we're in an age where, unfortunately, people are out looking for reasons to cast aspersions on the voting process.

522
00:37:58,233 --> 00:38:07,735
[SPEAKER_16]: We cannot continue to open the city up to this kind of liability, and it's extremely frustrating because the City Council has brought up this issue before.

523
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:15,617
[SPEAKER_16]: We've tried to prevent this issue from happening before it happened for a second time, and it did.

524
00:38:17,291 --> 00:38:26,321
[SPEAKER_16]: And we are saying now, as a council, we can't condone a disorganized and inconsistent voting experience, or even really a difficult voting experience for any voter.

525
00:38:26,341 --> 00:38:27,482
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not how it's supposed to be.

526
00:38:28,923 --> 00:38:29,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Voting isn't a privilege.

527
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:31,927
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a right, and it shouldn't be difficult.

528
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:32,607
[SPEAKER_16]: It should be easy.

529
00:38:32,627 --> 00:38:34,269
[SPEAKER_16]: And it was difficult.

530
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:45,345
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate the resolution to ask the administration for appropriation to fulfill full staffing in the elections office.

531
00:38:45,525 --> 00:38:47,127
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's necessary.

532
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:50,089
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we saw it was necessary before this election.

533
00:38:50,748 --> 00:38:56,772
[SPEAKER_16]: And now I think that we're again seeing the symptoms of an underfunded essential municipal service.

534
00:38:57,392 --> 00:39:03,176
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that we need to see this office restored to its full capacity because this is what a lack of capacity looks like.

535
00:39:03,676 --> 00:39:12,782
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to see what accountability looks like, as Councilor Sang said, and we need to know what went wrong specifically, and we need to know what will change specifically.

536
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:31,819
[SPEAKER_16]: tomorrow, next week, the week after that, so that our multiple elections next year will be airtight and that every resident that has felt a lack of confidence or disenfranchised by this process can know that our next elections are multiple, very consequential elections next year will be airtight.

537
00:39:31,999 --> 00:39:36,301
[SPEAKER_16]: So I hope that the administration is listening and I hope that they will respond with the urgency that we feel.

538
00:39:36,802 --> 00:39:37,022
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

539
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,401
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

540
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:43,389
[SPEAKER_42]: I just want to make it very clear, I believe my fellow councilors have covered pretty much everything.

541
00:39:43,429 --> 00:39:47,135
[SPEAKER_42]: I do just want to note that elections are objectively more complicated these days.

542
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:52,002
[SPEAKER_42]: There's early voting, there's permanent mail ballots, there's election day voting, and

543
00:39:52,977 --> 00:40:00,983
[SPEAKER_42]: The council, I think, really under the request and advisement of our previous elections coordinator, moved to that commission format to streamline this process.

544
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:06,788
[SPEAKER_42]: And unfortunately, as a result, that commission and that office, well, not the commission, but the office was understaffed.

545
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:09,230
[SPEAKER_42]: And this is something that council pointed out time and time again.

546
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:12,493
[SPEAKER_42]: We asked for that office to be staffed up, and it was not heard.

547
00:40:12,613 --> 00:40:17,477
[SPEAKER_42]: So we did one thing, and then we got a negative outcome from it, because the

548
00:40:18,143 --> 00:40:21,005
[SPEAKER_42]: the mayor's end was not upheld essentially from our wishes.

549
00:40:21,125 --> 00:40:25,628
[SPEAKER_42]: So again, I think just want to make both those things clear that there is a lot of moving pieces.

550
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:29,650
[SPEAKER_42]: There are more moving pieces than there ever have been in our elections or local elections.

551
00:40:30,151 --> 00:40:36,535
[SPEAKER_42]: And we made a change that was asked for and we believe would absolutely streamline and make this process easier, but without the staffing.

552
00:40:37,094 --> 00:40:43,859
[SPEAKER_42]: It doesn't work, so I appreciate Vice President Behrs bringing that up, as well as the appropriation for that staffing that we've been asking for this whole time.

553
00:40:43,879 --> 00:40:49,622
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'll go back to Vice President Behrs, and then I know there's likely a lot of folks who want to speak on this, so I want to make sure we can open up the floor.

554
00:40:50,563 --> 00:40:52,424
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

555
00:40:52,945 --> 00:40:54,906
[SPEAKER_24]: I'll be briefer, because you basically just made my point.

556
00:40:55,535 --> 00:41:06,140
[SPEAKER_24]: We voted in the spring of 2022 to adopt a piece of state law that modernized the system and moved us from the clerk and registrar voters to a formal elections commission.

557
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,563
[SPEAKER_24]: The intent of this body was that we would have an elections department with a director that would be at least as well staffed as it was previously.

558
00:41:14,143 --> 00:41:23,287
[SPEAKER_24]: Under the clerk-registrar-voter system, you had the full-time clerk, three full-time staff in the elections office, as well as the full-time elections coordinator for much of the year.

559
00:41:24,568 --> 00:41:26,851
[SPEAKER_24]: Then you also had the volunteer board of registrars.

560
00:41:27,152 --> 00:41:28,273
[SPEAKER_24]: That was an oversight body.

561
00:41:28,974 --> 00:41:31,638
[SPEAKER_24]: We moved to the Elections Commission and the budget came back.

562
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:35,743
[SPEAKER_24]: We went from five, essentially five full-time staff, to two and a half.

563
00:41:36,862 --> 00:41:37,022
[SPEAKER_24]: Right?

564
00:41:37,282 --> 00:41:41,244
[SPEAKER_24]: We went, we now have two full-time staff, one 20 hour a week, halftime person.

565
00:41:41,264 --> 00:41:44,165
[SPEAKER_24]: That position is not even filled because nobody wants it.

566
00:41:45,126 --> 00:41:47,567
[SPEAKER_24]: It doesn't make sense to have a 20 hour a week position.

567
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:54,730
[SPEAKER_24]: You had a ton of work of this election then fall on election commissioners who are not supposed to be running the election.

568
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,251
[SPEAKER_24]: They're supposed to be certifying results, overseeing it.

569
00:41:57,271 --> 00:41:58,932
[SPEAKER_24]: They're not supposed to be in the nitty gritty.

570
00:41:58,952 --> 00:42:05,535
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, the last people in the office were the elections manager and the elections commissioners and LHS, which is the service the state uses.

571
00:42:06,312 --> 00:42:10,316
[SPEAKER_24]: Why are the elections commissioners cleaning up this mess at the 11th hour?

572
00:42:10,336 --> 00:42:11,316
[SPEAKER_24]: That should be what the staff is.

573
00:42:11,917 --> 00:42:14,119
[SPEAKER_24]: Staff, you should have me fully staffed, so you're never in that position.

574
00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:16,241
[SPEAKER_24]: The commission is an oversight authority.

575
00:42:16,261 --> 00:42:17,462
[SPEAKER_24]: They're not meant to be working.

576
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:19,804
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just want to be working staff.

577
00:42:19,844 --> 00:42:22,326
[SPEAKER_24]: And basically, I just want to be really clear here.

578
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:31,293
[SPEAKER_24]: When you basically cut the staff in half and then you try to backfill with volunteers or poll workers or temporary workers, it's not gonna work out.

579
00:42:32,114 --> 00:42:34,495
[SPEAKER_24]: And we were very clear about that from the get-go.

580
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:36,856
[SPEAKER_24]: There's an election in 14 weeks.

581
00:42:36,876 --> 00:42:37,857
[SPEAKER_24]: There's an election in March.

582
00:42:38,197 --> 00:42:43,020
[SPEAKER_24]: There are four elections between the one we just had, including the one we just had in next November.

583
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:48,083
[SPEAKER_24]: As the president just said, elections are more complicated than ever.

584
00:42:48,103 --> 00:42:49,043
[SPEAKER_24]: They're more frequent than ever.

585
00:42:49,063 --> 00:42:50,484
[SPEAKER_24]: They require more resources.

586
00:42:51,171 --> 00:42:57,438
[SPEAKER_24]: And instead, it seems that the choice was made that this was a place where we could find cuts and save money.

587
00:42:57,478 --> 00:43:01,763
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, I think we all know my position that the city budget is massively underfunded.

588
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:05,467
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't think the place you start finding money is in the elections department.

589
00:43:05,887 --> 00:43:11,053
[SPEAKER_24]: When the council explicitly voted to modernize and fund the department because elections are getting more complicated,

590
00:43:11,483 --> 00:43:15,004
[SPEAKER_24]: and requiring more staff time and requiring more attention, not less.

591
00:43:15,624 --> 00:43:30,768
[SPEAKER_24]: So even if we get accountability, even if there's changes of whatever kind, even if we get a report that says, here's all the things that we did wrong and we're gonna do them better next time, it's not gonna get fixed unless the department is fully funded, staffed and staffed competently.

592
00:43:31,428 --> 00:43:32,468
[SPEAKER_24]: And that needs to happen.

593
00:43:32,788 --> 00:43:38,409
[SPEAKER_24]: So this council has been saying that the whole reason we tried to do this process was to get us there.

594
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:40,810
[SPEAKER_24]: We did what was within our authority.

595
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:42,811
[SPEAKER_24]: to make that happen.

596
00:43:43,111 --> 00:43:46,293
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, as President Morrell said, the follow up wasn't there.

597
00:43:46,974 --> 00:43:52,698
[SPEAKER_24]: The actually funding and appropriating and implementing this modernization process fell flat.

598
00:43:52,938 --> 00:44:00,503
[SPEAKER_24]: And we're seeing the results this year, in addition to the November 2022 election, where there were some of the similar mistakes that we saw this year happened as well.

599
00:44:00,683 --> 00:44:04,266
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, all this council can do at this point is

600
00:44:05,106 --> 00:44:16,293
[SPEAKER_24]: put forward resolutions, and then, as Councillor Scarpelli said earlier, approve the appropriations when they come down, because if they had come down, I'm sure we would have held a special meeting to approve anything to get the additional surge resources in.

601
00:44:17,354 --> 00:44:20,696
[SPEAKER_24]: The call never came, and we don't have the authority to make appropriations.

602
00:44:21,016 --> 00:44:25,059
[SPEAKER_24]: So that side of things needs to be addressed as well.

603
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:25,519
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

604
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,100
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

605
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,901
[SPEAKER_42]: Any further discussion from the council at this time?

606
00:44:28,962 --> 00:44:29,402
[SPEAKER_42]: Councillor Sayng.

607
00:44:30,151 --> 00:44:45,218
[SPEAKER_22]: just more, this is more of a detail, but I would like to see what, if there is a report that comes out of this, I would like to see analysis of the low staffing levels, the funding problem, very specific about those questions.

608
00:44:45,318 --> 00:44:54,923
[SPEAKER_22]: I would also like to see, I believe that we had talked about, or the mayor's administration has decided that we would rely on some seasonal

609
00:44:55,832 --> 00:44:58,874
[SPEAKER_22]: more seasonal employment of employees.

610
00:44:58,894 --> 00:45:07,939
[SPEAKER_22]: And we talked at length back then when we were reviewing the budget about how we needed full-time staff for that department.

611
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:11,581
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'd like to see reference to that in the report.

612
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:12,622
[SPEAKER_42]: Would you like that as an amendment?

613
00:45:12,842 --> 00:45:13,302
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, please.

614
00:45:13,642 --> 00:45:13,943
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

615
00:45:14,963 --> 00:45:16,984
[SPEAKER_42]: Any other further discussion?

616
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:22,906
[SPEAKER_36]: I think we are at the point where everybody really expressed the same thing.

617
00:45:23,426 --> 00:45:40,672
[SPEAKER_36]: So I think the governing body in the state needs to get involved, and I think that this council should send a letter to the Secretary of State's office, to Galvin's office, so I'd make that a formal motion that we craft a letter, send it to the Secretary of State's office, and ask them to look into this process.

618
00:45:44,885 --> 00:45:46,326
[SPEAKER_36]: Please.

619
00:45:47,227 --> 00:46:02,097
[SPEAKER_36]: And just if I can, Madam President, I don't want people to understand that when we heard all these issues, the poll workers that are there are maybe mostly the sweetest people in the world.

620
00:46:02,117 --> 00:46:05,199
[SPEAKER_36]: They're doing something that's thankless, truly is thankless.

621
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:12,544
[SPEAKER_36]: But one thing that was resounding throughout that day is how they weren't trained properly.

622
00:46:13,373 --> 00:46:15,394
[SPEAKER_36]: They didn't know what was right.

623
00:46:16,255 --> 00:46:22,980
[SPEAKER_36]: And the sweetest woman that I love dearly, when I went to vote, she looked at me and she said, the first three letters of your name.

624
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,982
[SPEAKER_36]: And I said, no, that's not how it goes.

625
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:30,218
[SPEAKER_36]: But these are the issues that went on everywhere.

626
00:46:30,598 --> 00:46:36,820
[SPEAKER_36]: We had one poll watcher that was put 25 feet away in the corner, was presented the law.

627
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:41,502
[SPEAKER_36]: She was then moved by the warden behind eight feet away in compliance.

628
00:46:42,202 --> 00:46:48,424
[SPEAKER_36]: And then our elections commissioner came in and said, get out, go back to where you were.

629
00:46:48,925 --> 00:46:49,685
[SPEAKER_36]: That's not the rule.

630
00:46:51,385 --> 00:46:55,167
[SPEAKER_36]: So it was the arrogance as well, because you have people that volunteered.

631
00:46:56,123 --> 00:46:59,424
[SPEAKER_36]: and as part of this process, which this is what we want in our country.

632
00:47:00,044 --> 00:47:02,284
[SPEAKER_36]: We want fair and open involved processes.

633
00:47:03,085 --> 00:47:18,748
[SPEAKER_36]: So, and again, I think that letter that we draft helps with the healing and the understand that we can move on and understand that we have something in place, Madam President, for especially November, that we feel safe and confident in our processes.

634
00:47:19,848 --> 00:47:20,128
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

635
00:47:20,208 --> 00:47:22,369
[SPEAKER_42]: Any further discussion from the council?

636
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:27,768
[SPEAKER_42]: Seeing none, if there's any members of the public who would like to speak, feel free to come up to the mic.

637
00:47:28,848 --> 00:47:29,588
[SPEAKER_42]: Who wants to speak?

638
00:47:38,091 --> 00:47:41,212
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address for the record, please, and just push the button on the mic.

639
00:47:42,852 --> 00:47:43,152
[SPEAKER_42]: There you go.

640
00:47:43,172 --> 00:47:43,532
[SPEAKER_42]: You're good.

641
00:47:44,953 --> 00:47:45,193
[SPEAKER_43]: I'm good.

642
00:47:45,793 --> 00:47:46,713
[SPEAKER_42]: Yep, you're all set.

643
00:47:46,773 --> 00:47:47,393
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

644
00:47:47,533 --> 00:47:48,373
[SPEAKER_42]: I know you can't see the light.

645
00:47:48,413 --> 00:47:49,054
[SPEAKER_42]: We can see it, though.

646
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:50,814
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

647
00:47:51,294 --> 00:47:52,555
[SPEAKER_14]: And just name and address for the record, please.

648
00:47:53,315 --> 00:47:53,995
[SPEAKER_14]: Michelle Vepetto.

649
00:47:55,137 --> 00:47:55,837
[SPEAKER_14]: 29 Daniel Street.

650
00:47:57,038 --> 00:47:58,738
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a lifelong resident of Medford.

651
00:48:00,678 --> 00:48:03,779
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was at the senior center from 6.50 a.m.

652
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:05,220
[SPEAKER_14]: to 2.30 p.m.

653
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:14,902
[SPEAKER_14]: The warden was immediately angry with me when I gave her my sheet and told her that I was an observer for the Caviello campaign.

654
00:48:16,402 --> 00:48:20,303
[SPEAKER_14]: She called someone on the phone and I was treated terribly all day.

655
00:48:22,724 --> 00:48:23,544
[SPEAKER_14]: During this time,

656
00:48:24,933 --> 00:48:36,038
[SPEAKER_14]: there, I witnessed at 10.50, there was an elderly woman who came in a wheelchair and asked for assistance in filling out her ballot.

657
00:48:36,898 --> 00:48:38,419
[SPEAKER_14]: The woman stood next to her.

658
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:45,802
[SPEAKER_14]: She said she would read the names and then check off for her.

659
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:51,965
[SPEAKER_14]: What she said was, for mayor, do you wanna vote for the incumbent?

660
00:48:53,567 --> 00:49:00,189
[SPEAKER_14]: The elderly lady was a little confused, and she looked at her, and then she said, oh yes, the incumbent.

661
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:17,935
[SPEAKER_14]: The warden read off the city council then, and she read, Beers, Collins, Tang, Callahan, Lazaro, Leming, Roth.

662
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:22,257
[SPEAKER_14]: After each name, the warden said, should I check that one?

663
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:28,051
[SPEAKER_14]: At the end, I heard the voter ask, who else is there?

664
00:49:29,952 --> 00:49:32,974
[SPEAKER_14]: The warden said, you already voted for seven.

665
00:49:33,995 --> 00:49:36,937
[SPEAKER_14]: You can't vote for anyone anymore.

666
00:49:37,798 --> 00:49:40,180
[SPEAKER_14]: She did not mention any of the other names.

667
00:49:42,001 --> 00:49:44,804
[SPEAKER_14]: The warden said, okay, now school committee.

668
00:49:45,684 --> 00:49:50,228
[SPEAKER_14]: The voter asked, no, I don't know anyone on the school committee

669
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:54,995
[SPEAKER_14]: So the warden replied, are you all done then?

670
00:49:55,675 --> 00:49:56,696
[SPEAKER_14]: The woman said, yes.

671
00:49:58,977 --> 00:50:03,799
[SPEAKER_14]: There were voters that came in and were told that they were at the wrong polling place.

672
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Most of those, they were told that they were supposed to be at the Brooks.

673
00:50:10,063 --> 00:50:14,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Some was told they could cast their vote, but not put it in the machine.

674
00:50:14,585 --> 00:50:21,209
[SPEAKER_14]: It was put in a stack of others in a big manila envelope.

675
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:28,405
[SPEAKER_14]: except one person went around and put it in the machine.

676
00:50:30,146 --> 00:50:33,248
[SPEAKER_14]: The others were directed to where they were supposed to vote.

677
00:50:34,989 --> 00:50:40,273
[SPEAKER_14]: At 9 a.m., a woman who asked to cast her vote was told no.

678
00:50:42,114 --> 00:50:44,495
[SPEAKER_14]: She said she had to go to the book school.

679
00:50:45,076 --> 00:50:46,797
[SPEAKER_14]: The voter said that I can't get there.

680
00:50:48,486 --> 00:50:56,630
[SPEAKER_14]: They called Melissa, who spoke to the voter on the phone, and she told her that she couldn't vote at the senior center.

681
00:50:58,851 --> 00:51:14,138
[SPEAKER_14]: There were about 15 voters that came in and were told that they were inactive and were asked for an ID, or some produced a picture ID with their address, driver's license, and others produced a credit card, passport with just a name.

682
00:51:15,685 --> 00:51:19,687
[SPEAKER_14]: There were voters that did not have an ID and they let them vote.

683
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:27,411
[SPEAKER_14]: They voted and those ballots were again put in a manila envelope and not in the machine.

684
00:51:29,431 --> 00:51:38,516
[SPEAKER_14]: I noted the name of a voter, Nancy Batari Batari from Riverside Ave, who came in very upset.

685
00:51:40,282 --> 00:51:41,645
[SPEAKER_14]: She had a mail-in ballot.

686
00:51:42,306 --> 00:51:49,659
[SPEAKER_14]: She said she never requested a mail-in ballot, always votes in person, and she wanted to vote in person.

687
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:54,579
[SPEAKER_14]: as she always does.

688
00:51:55,479 --> 00:52:00,422
[SPEAKER_14]: They told her to open the envelope, and they were rude to her.

689
00:52:01,283 --> 00:52:05,865
[SPEAKER_14]: She showed them it was blank, and they told her to fill it out and give it to the warden.

690
00:52:06,966 --> 00:52:17,572
[SPEAKER_14]: The voter filled it out, went right over and put it in the machine, and the workers were all standing in front of her, preventing her from putting it in the machine.

691
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:21,495
[SPEAKER_14]: And she went around them, and she put her vote right in the machine.

692
00:52:27,565 --> 00:52:30,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

693
00:52:30,246 --> 00:52:37,528
[SPEAKER_14]: So the warden had a mnemonic envelope and she kept putting the ballots in and they were not individually labeled.

694
00:52:38,908 --> 00:52:42,469
[SPEAKER_14]: And then she kept on putting it behind her or behind her on a chair.

695
00:52:43,149 --> 00:52:50,091
[SPEAKER_14]: This council should be very upset at the poor caddy behavior of the warden, the election workers and Melissa.

696
00:52:50,811 --> 00:52:55,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Upon arrival, the warden told me that I was not allowed anywhere near the registration table.

697
00:52:56,293 --> 00:53:01,814
[SPEAKER_14]: I could only stand and I could not use one of the hundred vacant chairs to sit in.

698
00:53:01,834 --> 00:53:07,176
[SPEAKER_14]: I was shocked and I am a disabled taxpaying property owner.

699
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:15,438
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was standing in a building owned by taxpayers being told I could not sit in a chair that I, a taxpayer, paid for.

700
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:25,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Melissa arrived gruffly and told me that I could only stand in the corner and that I could not use a chair, table, wall, outlets, amenities.

701
00:53:26,293 --> 00:53:28,715
[SPEAKER_14]: She called the officer over to stand next to me.

702
00:53:29,676 --> 00:53:33,180
[SPEAKER_14]: The registration ladies were checking in voters by last name.

703
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:37,424
[SPEAKER_14]: They weren't calling the last name or the street address.

704
00:53:38,085 --> 00:53:40,968
[SPEAKER_14]: When I asked them to, I was ignored.

705
00:53:43,513 --> 00:53:52,919
[SPEAKER_14]: When Miss Knight arrived, I asked to be closer to hear and asked if they were supposed to be calling out the names and addresses so I could hear.

706
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Adam told me yes and spoke to the warden and told her the rules.

707
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,843
[SPEAKER_14]: She got back on the phone again.

708
00:53:59,443 --> 00:54:08,950
[SPEAKER_14]: After Adam left, she told me to move even further away, 30 feet from the registration table, and I could barely hear at all.

709
00:54:09,878 --> 00:54:13,391
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the attorneys for the cabiano campaign arrived told the warden.

710
00:54:14,806 --> 00:54:18,327
[SPEAKER_14]: who they were and moved me closer so I could observe and hear.

711
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:32,853
[SPEAKER_14]: After that attorney left, Melissa arrived at 1130, she reprimanded me loudly, and she said she didn't care what Adam or the attorney or anyone else said, that those were her rules and that they were all wrong.

712
00:54:33,833 --> 00:54:38,154
[SPEAKER_14]: The workers, the wardens, and the wardens were passing notes to each other.

713
00:54:38,214 --> 00:54:39,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Melissa came back.

714
00:54:40,197 --> 00:54:50,919
[SPEAKER_14]: with a male and female officer told me that if I didn't comply to escort me out the building, I was shaken, I was embarrassed, I was unjustly bullied.

715
00:54:51,479 --> 00:54:57,180
[SPEAKER_14]: Melissa moved the table in front of me and put lunch boxes so I couldn't even see the registration machine.

716
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:08,982
[SPEAKER_14]: So I am just asking as a taxpayer, I'm asking for a full recount to the vote to restore my faith in the integrity of the voting.

717
00:55:12,663 --> 00:55:13,043
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

718
00:55:13,063 --> 00:55:13,423
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

719
00:55:13,984 --> 00:55:17,666
[SPEAKER_42]: Are there any other members of the public who would like to speak?

720
00:55:17,766 --> 00:55:26,032
[SPEAKER_42]: We'll just try to keep to five minutes, because I know a lot of people want to speak, and we have other issues tonight that a lot of people want to speak on as well.

721
00:55:26,092 --> 00:55:27,933
[SPEAKER_20]: Tiffany Bair, 14-ish Road.

722
00:55:28,493 --> 00:55:37,719
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm curious, many of you up here have said that with all these things that have happened, that you're pretty sure that the election would not be different, the results.

723
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:39,080
[SPEAKER_20]: How are you guys so sure?

724
00:55:41,124 --> 00:55:41,584
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't get it.

725
00:55:43,385 --> 00:55:49,729
[SPEAKER_20]: It seems like it was actually quite the big cluster F. I'm not going to say the word.

726
00:55:50,249 --> 00:55:57,133
[SPEAKER_20]: And so, especially the mayoral election, it was pretty damn close.

727
00:55:57,473 --> 00:55:59,834
[SPEAKER_20]: With all these mistakes, this could easily have gone differently.

728
00:56:02,548 --> 00:56:05,309
[SPEAKER_20]: I say let's have a fricking mayoral election.

729
00:56:05,569 --> 00:56:06,249
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't right.

730
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:07,949
[SPEAKER_20]: This needs to be fixed.

731
00:56:07,969 --> 00:56:09,190
[SPEAKER_20]: And not just talking either.

732
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:15,151
[SPEAKER_20]: It needs to be like what Mr. Scarpelli said, they need to come up with a plan.

733
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:16,872
[SPEAKER_20]: But then we need to have like dates.

734
00:56:16,912 --> 00:56:18,092
[SPEAKER_20]: You're gonna finish this by then.

735
00:56:18,172 --> 00:56:19,092
[SPEAKER_20]: You're gonna do this by then.

736
00:56:19,452 --> 00:56:21,733
[SPEAKER_20]: And someone needs to be fired, honestly.

737
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,453
[SPEAKER_20]: Because they didn't do their job.

738
00:56:24,373 --> 00:56:27,454
[SPEAKER_20]: And election integrity doesn't exist in Medford, period.

739
00:56:28,374 --> 00:56:29,135
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to fix that.

740
00:56:29,735 --> 00:56:30,015
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

741
00:56:43,904 --> 00:56:44,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

742
00:56:47,087 --> 00:56:49,589
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue.

743
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:56,796
[SPEAKER_01]: From everything I've read this evening, it seems that this election was flawed.

744
00:56:58,118 --> 00:57:03,242
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't understand that the council will accept a flawed election.

745
00:57:04,098 --> 00:57:06,920
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, who knows about the outcome, whether it would be the same or not.

746
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:07,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it would be.

747
00:57:09,201 --> 00:57:12,924
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't trust this city the way it's run in the last two elections, OK?

748
00:57:14,725 --> 00:57:17,727
[SPEAKER_01]: We have good people running, and probably good people get in, OK?

749
00:57:18,087 --> 00:57:21,149
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is, the damn thing was flawed.

750
00:57:21,169 --> 00:57:21,870
[SPEAKER_01]: It was FUBA.

751
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:23,531
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can't believe this.

752
00:57:23,551 --> 00:57:24,952
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't accept this election.

753
00:57:25,352 --> 00:57:26,813
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to go and do it again.

754
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:31,296
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't want to hear about it costs money, because we have money available.

755
00:57:32,156 --> 00:57:32,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

756
00:57:35,947 --> 00:57:36,187
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

757
00:57:36,207 --> 00:57:42,672
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address for the record, please.

758
00:57:43,812 --> 00:57:45,814
[SPEAKER_37]: John Souza, 359 Winthrop Street.

759
00:57:47,095 --> 00:57:52,098
[SPEAKER_37]: So I was a poll watcher for the Carbiello campaign on Tuesday.

760
00:57:52,118 --> 00:58:00,524
[SPEAKER_37]: A lot of you were talking about funding and money may be the issue to solving some of these problems.

761
00:58:01,204 --> 00:58:04,867
[SPEAKER_37]: But I witnessed for about a three and a half hour period at the Brooks School,

762
00:58:06,173 --> 00:58:18,828
[SPEAKER_37]: was over 50%, which was probably close to over 150 voters at the time, came in, gave their first three letters of their

763
00:58:20,233 --> 00:58:25,896
[SPEAKER_37]: first name, first three letters of their last name, which we were able to overcome that issue and make it work.

764
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:31,739
[SPEAKER_37]: But more than 50% of them were told you requested a mail-in ballot.

765
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,902
[SPEAKER_37]: You now need to go over to the warden's table, you need to get cleared to come back and vote.

766
00:58:38,763 --> 00:58:41,765
[SPEAKER_37]: Some of those people said, never request the mail-in ballot.

767
00:58:42,125 --> 00:58:48,809
[SPEAKER_37]: Some of those people said, did request the mail-in ballot, didn't fill it out, didn't have time, didn't understand the directions,

768
00:58:49,555 --> 00:58:50,015
[SPEAKER_37]: It's money.

769
00:58:50,555 --> 00:58:51,036
[SPEAKER_37]: It's money.

770
00:58:52,216 --> 00:59:01,761
[SPEAKER_37]: Those are dollars spent to issue those ballots that weren't used in the correct form for one reason or another.

771
00:59:02,281 --> 00:59:06,783
[SPEAKER_37]: So if money is the problem, this is an area where this council can look.

772
00:59:07,415 --> 00:59:15,182
[SPEAKER_37]: to potentially recoup some of the money necessary to fund these types of elections appropriately.

773
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:19,546
[SPEAKER_37]: And the fact that I'm listening to this tonight is disgusting.

774
00:59:19,566 --> 00:59:20,646
[SPEAKER_37]: And I

775
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:31,796
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm like borderline speechless that this is actually a conversation taking place in the city I grew up in and love.

776
00:59:32,756 --> 00:59:36,097
[SPEAKER_37]: So this needs to get solved and I agree with everybody else.

777
00:59:36,677 --> 00:59:44,719
[SPEAKER_37]: There needs to be a clear definitive answer what the results of this election actually were.

778
00:59:45,179 --> 00:59:48,960
[SPEAKER_37]: And we can't just assume because assuming got us where we are today.

779
00:59:56,316 --> 00:59:56,597
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

780
00:59:56,617 --> 00:59:57,761
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address for the record, please.

781
00:59:58,282 --> 00:59:59,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, everyone.

782
00:59:59,386 --> 01:00:03,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Sharon Diesso, 130 Circuit Road in Mass Avenue, Metric.

783
01:00:03,727 --> 01:00:06,970
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been a resident of the city for many years and seen progress.

784
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:11,935
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen change, new schools, older buildings rerouting.

785
01:00:12,936 --> 01:00:22,105
[SPEAKER_09]: I just had a novel article published about the change in the road of Upper Governors Avenue and how it destroyed about 40 homes' property value.

786
01:00:22,826 --> 01:00:26,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Like thieves in the night, they came, put them down, claimed that we all got flyers.

787
01:00:27,150 --> 01:00:28,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody got a flyer.

788
01:00:28,863 --> 01:00:32,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyway, these are just some of the examples that go by us.

789
01:00:32,666 --> 01:00:34,488
[SPEAKER_09]: It just, what's gonna happen?

790
01:00:34,508 --> 01:00:40,332
[SPEAKER_09]: The next thing that's gonna happen, we'll have another election like this, but I won't.

791
01:00:41,733 --> 01:00:43,455
[SPEAKER_42]: Oops, I think you're accidentally touching the button.

792
01:00:44,035 --> 01:00:45,696
[SPEAKER_42]: There's a button, just don't.

793
01:00:46,137 --> 01:00:47,258
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, stop touching it.

794
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:48,018
[SPEAKER_42]: Hang on, hang on.

795
01:00:48,418 --> 01:00:49,379
[SPEAKER_42]: Once and then I'll tell you.

796
01:00:49,539 --> 01:00:50,420
[SPEAKER_42]: There you go, okay, nope.

797
01:00:50,860 --> 01:00:51,421
[SPEAKER_42]: Once, okay.

798
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,402
[SPEAKER_42]: Just touch, okay, push it once.

799
01:00:54,355 --> 01:00:55,335
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, hand off, hand off.

800
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:56,456
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay, you're good.

801
01:00:56,876 --> 01:00:57,476
[SPEAKER_42]: You can't see the light.

802
01:00:57,496 --> 01:00:58,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me now?

803
01:00:58,277 --> 01:00:59,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

804
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I'm present.

805
01:01:01,418 --> 01:01:08,241
[SPEAKER_09]: So people bring up things that are going on in the nation, et cetera, et cetera, but this is like a mini nation right here.

806
01:01:08,261 --> 01:01:15,124
[SPEAKER_09]: And a big point of discussion is we should be getting some sort of things for our tax dollars.

807
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:17,385
[SPEAKER_09]: People work very hard in campaigns.

808
01:01:17,905 --> 01:01:19,846
[SPEAKER_09]: They extend their time to come here.

809
01:01:20,466 --> 01:01:22,447
[SPEAKER_09]: on council, school committee, et cetera.

810
01:01:23,428 --> 01:01:33,433
[SPEAKER_09]: If I were to purchase a house and skipped or did something and never had my signature validated on a P&S form, I would not legally own that home.

811
01:01:34,916 --> 01:01:37,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm not a lawyer, but I think I'm correct.

812
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:43,105
[SPEAKER_09]: But I really agree with Mr. D'Antonio and one of the other speakers who came up.

813
01:01:43,686 --> 01:01:47,791
[SPEAKER_09]: There has to be something done about this, the results of this election.

814
01:01:48,892 --> 01:01:54,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Not even a recount, I think the election, I hate to say it, because I,

815
01:01:55,372 --> 01:01:59,495
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, been here a very long time, that it just was not a legal election.

816
01:02:00,276 --> 01:02:04,739
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can take that into account and maybe you can go along the same steps.

817
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:20,572
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing about the results when people said, well, you know, then you can test the results anyway, it deems and behooves you yourselves because you may have even gained more votes yourselves and don't know it on the council in the school committee.

818
01:02:21,092 --> 01:02:24,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Or some of you may not really have earned the seat yourselves.

819
01:02:25,917 --> 01:02:27,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you and good evening.

820
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:28,039
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

821
01:02:28,059 --> 01:02:32,141
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm going to go to, oops, sorry.

822
01:02:32,161 --> 01:02:37,524
[SPEAKER_42]: I know I had a hand up on Zoom, but I think, Eileen, I saw your hand up, but I forgot you were there for a little while.

823
01:02:38,164 --> 01:02:40,766
[SPEAKER_42]: Raise your hand if you want to speak, otherwise we'll go to folks in person.

824
01:02:40,786 --> 01:02:46,389
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, is there anyone else in person who would like to speak?

825
01:02:51,872 --> 01:02:52,413
[SPEAKER_34]: Good evening.

826
01:02:53,702 --> 01:03:02,244
[SPEAKER_34]: City Councilors, Madam President, Mr. Vice President, Mr. Clerk, I had the privilege and honor.

827
01:03:02,684 --> 01:03:05,504
[SPEAKER_34]: Sandra Gale, Fulton Street.

828
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:18,707
[SPEAKER_34]: I had the privilege of standing before this council to acquire an elections department, a department that was going to go into the 21st century.

829
01:03:20,534 --> 01:03:25,776
[SPEAKER_34]: with the things that were put in place, we should have gotten there.

830
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:33,218
[SPEAKER_34]: I was approached last week by someone who said, well, you know, this must make you feel really good.

831
01:03:33,778 --> 01:03:34,579
[SPEAKER_34]: No, this doesn't.

832
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:37,580
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a very sad thing.

833
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:50,204
[SPEAKER_34]: Our basic, basic functioning right of letting our voice be heard through voting sounds to me like it was voter suppression.

834
01:03:51,745 --> 01:04:02,129
[SPEAKER_34]: And voter suppression should not be tolerated in the municipality of Medford, across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, or across the United States.

835
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:10,312
[SPEAKER_34]: And if we don't stand up and demand answers, it will continue to happen.

836
01:04:11,813 --> 01:04:16,575
[SPEAKER_34]: I respectfully acknowledge that counting votes

837
01:04:17,267 --> 01:04:21,408
[SPEAKER_34]: or looking at the process may not change the outcome of the election.

838
01:04:22,229 --> 01:04:26,790
[SPEAKER_34]: But what you need is integrity and you need accountability.

839
01:04:26,810 --> 01:04:35,673
[SPEAKER_34]: You can't go through three federal elections coming up very shortly and not have some sort of accountability.

840
01:04:36,697 --> 01:04:40,338
[SPEAKER_34]: And the elections are not gonna get easier, they're going to get harder.

841
01:04:41,018 --> 01:04:51,280
[SPEAKER_34]: And without proper organization and proper planning and being able to work more than a 35 or 40 hour a week job, you can't get it done.

842
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,200
[SPEAKER_34]: It's just not possible.

843
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:59,521
[SPEAKER_34]: And it shouldn't make anybody who is an elected official in this city feel good about anything.

844
01:05:01,121 --> 01:05:04,322
[SPEAKER_34]: So we need to make sure that the counts are accurate.

845
01:05:05,222 --> 01:05:07,823
[SPEAKER_34]: I appreciate your time and letting me say something.

846
01:05:08,343 --> 01:05:08,703
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

847
01:05:08,903 --> 01:05:09,283
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

848
01:05:09,423 --> 01:05:15,745
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

849
01:05:15,805 --> 01:05:17,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Eileen, I will unmute you.

850
01:05:17,045 --> 01:05:23,647
[SPEAKER_02]: A little frozen.

851
01:05:30,889 --> 01:05:33,531
[SPEAKER_42]: either means frozen or we're frozen.

852
01:05:33,611 --> 01:05:37,995
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm sure I'll come back at an opportune time and address the record.

853
01:05:38,015 --> 01:05:38,376
[SPEAKER_42]: We'll go to you.

854
01:05:39,156 --> 01:05:46,283
[SPEAKER_31]: Hi, Melanie Trongali, 116 Forest Street and a recent candidate for the 2023 election.

855
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:57,793
[SPEAKER_31]: And just sitting here, a couple of things that really stuck out at me is that there was listed probably 10 to 15 issues with the election from beginning to end.

856
01:06:00,015 --> 01:06:04,718
[SPEAKER_31]: 4,000 ballots, if I heard George right, were not counted, were not counted in public, or don't know how they were counted.

857
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:13,945
[SPEAKER_31]: You all said that there was a complicated process, more complicated process because of the early voting and the mail-in ballots.

858
01:06:14,885 --> 01:06:18,208
[SPEAKER_31]: And each one of you said that election integrity was an issue.

859
01:06:19,829 --> 01:06:23,832
[SPEAKER_31]: And given all those issues, how can you sit here and say 100% that the end result

860
01:06:26,348 --> 01:06:27,349
[SPEAKER_31]: will not be impacted.

861
01:06:27,909 --> 01:06:29,490
[SPEAKER_31]: I've been in business for 20 years.

862
01:06:30,471 --> 01:06:36,936
[SPEAKER_31]: And whenever there is a breakdown in process, there is usually an impact on the end.

863
01:06:37,717 --> 01:06:42,300
[SPEAKER_31]: Now, I'm not saying that those changes are going to be huge to make a difference in who won and who didn't win.

864
01:06:42,941 --> 01:06:50,727
[SPEAKER_31]: But there should be absolute 100% proof that what happened or the counts were accurate.

865
01:06:52,528 --> 01:06:53,589
[SPEAKER_31]: So thank you.

866
01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:54,110
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

867
01:06:59,938 --> 01:07:00,918
[SPEAKER_42]: Eileen, let's try this again.

868
01:07:00,958 --> 01:07:04,159
[SPEAKER_42]: It looks like I got kicked out of Zoom, so it looks like our connection's bad.

869
01:07:04,219 --> 01:07:09,081
[SPEAKER_42]: I keep looking a little frozen, so I don't have a lot of... Can you hear me now?

870
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:10,761
[SPEAKER_42]: I can hear you, yeah.

871
01:07:10,841 --> 01:07:12,722
[SPEAKER_42]: It might help to... Okay.

872
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:13,762
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

873
01:07:14,683 --> 01:07:22,105
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I think it's a pleasure for once since I've lived in Medford that, you know, many people

874
01:07:23,543 --> 01:07:25,664
[SPEAKER_05]: feel the same way, that we're not divided.

875
01:07:25,744 --> 01:07:33,008
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to see a fair and free and safe and accessible election.

876
01:07:33,088 --> 01:07:34,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody wants to see that.

877
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:37,091
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were some issues

878
01:07:38,123 --> 01:07:45,467
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't seem like the people who are in the know think those issues were grave enough to hold another election.

879
01:07:46,067 --> 01:08:01,616
[SPEAKER_05]: And really, if we could afford another election, we probably would have enough money to have had a better result with the election to begin with, because it seems like all the problems go back to what all the problems are.

880
01:08:01,716 --> 01:08:05,098
[SPEAKER_05]: With the school committee, with everything, we don't have enough money.

881
01:08:06,514 --> 01:08:10,159
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and even the mayor can't manufacture money.

882
01:08:10,179 --> 01:08:13,344
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we have to get the money some way.

883
01:08:13,885 --> 01:08:16,369
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the issue that needs to be resolved.

884
01:08:16,529 --> 01:08:21,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think, you know, people are fallible, they make mistakes, but

885
01:08:21,937 --> 01:08:29,839
[SPEAKER_05]: How could you not make a mistake when you're so understaffed and you have such a monumental job to do?

886
01:08:29,859 --> 01:08:38,561
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I feel sorry for the people that had to do all this work, you know, and didn't have enough help.

887
01:08:39,021 --> 01:08:39,942
[SPEAKER_05]: How is that possible?

888
01:08:40,022 --> 01:08:43,643
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not possible for the two people to do that job.

889
01:08:43,743 --> 01:08:47,684
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was inevitable that issues would arise.

890
01:08:48,024 --> 01:08:48,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And

891
01:08:49,224 --> 01:08:52,666
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have to have a staff that can do the job.

892
01:08:53,107 --> 01:08:56,369
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have a staff that can do the job, we have to have money.

893
01:08:56,809 --> 01:09:04,475
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole problem, the way I see it, is not so much integrity, because I feel like all the people that were involved

894
01:09:05,315 --> 01:09:34,382
[SPEAKER_05]: have integrity and they tried to do the best they could and and it got messed up and yeah the city council and the people that live here we got to demand a better result but we also got to get the money to have a better result because i don't know how anything can change without more money thank you thank you can we just get your address for the record oh nine adams circle

895
01:09:35,497 --> 01:09:35,997
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Arlene.

896
01:09:36,037 --> 01:09:40,299
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak?

897
01:09:48,562 --> 01:09:48,882
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

898
01:09:48,962 --> 01:09:50,643
[SPEAKER_18]: Harry McGilvey for Piedmont Road.

899
01:09:52,864 --> 01:09:55,985
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been voting in this city since 1988 in every election.

900
01:09:56,785 --> 01:09:59,546
[SPEAKER_18]: I've worked the polls for about 20 years.

901
01:10:00,967 --> 01:10:03,248
[SPEAKER_18]: My only question is, when did this become so difficult?

902
01:10:04,677 --> 01:10:05,637
[SPEAKER_18]: I've never seen any of that.

903
01:10:05,657 --> 01:10:07,658
[SPEAKER_18]: I've never seen problems like this.

904
01:10:08,559 --> 01:10:09,779
[SPEAKER_18]: When did it become difficult?

905
01:10:09,859 --> 01:10:10,480
[SPEAKER_18]: What changed?

906
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:12,501
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

907
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:12,981
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

908
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:19,324
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak?

909
01:10:20,724 --> 01:10:21,425
[SPEAKER_42]: There's someone on Zoom.

910
01:10:21,465 --> 01:10:24,446
[SPEAKER_42]: I cannot see them because my internet is not working.

911
01:10:24,506 --> 01:10:26,947
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

912
01:10:27,047 --> 01:10:28,868
[SPEAKER_42]: Anyone else who would like to speak?

913
01:10:30,049 --> 01:10:30,569
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

914
01:10:37,566 --> 01:10:38,586
[SPEAKER_44]: Name and address for the record, please.

915
01:10:38,866 --> 01:10:39,166
[SPEAKER_44]: Sure.

916
01:10:39,247 --> 01:10:41,467
[SPEAKER_44]: Kelly Catalo, 23 Salem Street.

917
01:10:42,327 --> 01:10:47,789
[SPEAKER_44]: I was a candidate in the 2021 election and there was a lot of problems back then.

918
01:10:48,549 --> 01:10:55,811
[SPEAKER_44]: And I was told by this city hall that it would never happen again and that the problems would end.

919
01:10:56,692 --> 01:11:00,933
[SPEAKER_44]: We're hearing that there's 4,000 ballots that were not counted in public.

920
01:11:01,635 --> 01:11:04,458
[SPEAKER_44]: I was a poll worker for the Carabiello campaign.

921
01:11:05,019 --> 01:11:10,925
[SPEAKER_44]: I saw a lot of things that if any of these counselors were sitting in the room, they would have stopped.

922
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:13,347
[SPEAKER_44]: Are we just going to kick it forward again?

923
01:11:13,367 --> 01:11:19,033
[SPEAKER_44]: Are you going to kick it forward again to next year and say, we hope it doesn't happen again?

924
01:11:19,053 --> 01:11:21,055
[SPEAKER_44]: You had a voter stand here.

925
01:11:21,647 --> 01:11:31,992
[SPEAKER_44]: your constituent who asked you, let's just recount the vote, let's just do it, and let's prove to Medford that integrity in the vote exists in Medford.

926
01:11:33,353 --> 01:11:34,534
[SPEAKER_44]: I challenge you to do it.

927
01:11:34,694 --> 01:11:40,557
[SPEAKER_44]: I challenge any candidate that was on the card to call for a recount.

928
01:11:41,017 --> 01:11:41,978
[SPEAKER_44]: Do it by hand.

929
01:11:42,358 --> 01:11:46,320
[SPEAKER_44]: Let's prove to the voters that their election

930
01:11:47,432 --> 01:11:48,493
[SPEAKER_44]: has integrity.

931
01:11:48,973 --> 01:11:53,176
[SPEAKER_44]: Right now, as a voter in America, I don't know if I'll ever vote again.

932
01:11:54,057 --> 01:11:55,598
[SPEAKER_44]: It's really sad, because you know what?

933
01:11:55,738 --> 01:11:56,659
[SPEAKER_44]: I love this city.

934
01:11:57,239 --> 01:12:01,362
[SPEAKER_44]: I love this city more than most people.

935
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:08,388
[SPEAKER_44]: And it's sad that this is where it happens, 400 years after the day this city was born.

936
01:12:09,108 --> 01:12:15,953
[SPEAKER_44]: And I hope that you all bring it to an end, and you prove to the voters that they can still believe in Medford.

937
01:12:16,254 --> 01:12:16,634
[SPEAKER_44]: Thank you.

938
01:12:31,978 --> 01:12:32,918
[SPEAKER_42]: You can address with your heart, please.

939
01:12:33,879 --> 01:12:34,339
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

940
01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:37,280
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Charles Balboni.

941
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,220
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a Medford resident.

942
01:12:40,901 --> 01:12:44,262
[SPEAKER_17]: I've lived in this city for approximately 15 to 16 years.

943
01:12:47,383 --> 01:12:56,465
[SPEAKER_17]: In 2005, I was a lieutenant colonel in Afghanistan, defending the United States, defending our country.

944
01:12:57,806 --> 01:13:01,167
[SPEAKER_17]: And one of my jobs was to help oversee the elections

945
01:13:02,258 --> 01:13:03,459
[SPEAKER_17]: of the Afghan government.

946
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:10,323
[SPEAKER_17]: And let me just say, they did a fine better job at it than I saw the other day.

947
01:13:11,904 --> 01:13:21,511
[SPEAKER_17]: Every one of you have been reelected to your position and it's in your personal and professional and financial interest not to hold another election.

948
01:13:23,792 --> 01:13:25,173
[SPEAKER_17]: All of you should be ashamed.

949
01:13:26,294 --> 01:13:31,057
[SPEAKER_17]: This vote, this election was an absolute failure.

950
01:13:32,175 --> 01:13:41,652
[SPEAKER_17]: And to accept it is to say that you condone failure in the election, in the process that that flag is supposed to represent.

951
01:13:42,823 --> 01:13:49,187
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm asking all of you today to stand up and call for another election.

952
01:13:50,148 --> 01:13:52,069
[SPEAKER_17]: If you don't, I understand.

953
01:13:52,550 --> 01:14:00,896
[SPEAKER_17]: Every one of you has a personal and financial interest to keep this election as it is right now, settled.

954
01:14:01,096 --> 01:14:03,477
[SPEAKER_24]: Rick lost an election, she's not running again.

955
01:14:04,118 --> 01:14:06,239
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's not all of us have a personal financial interest.

956
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:07,360
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of you do.

957
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:09,181
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, so not all of us, sorry, thank you.

958
01:14:09,201 --> 01:14:11,323
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, with that,

959
01:14:12,618 --> 01:14:14,359
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much for hearing my complaint.

960
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:15,641
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

961
01:14:17,882 --> 01:14:22,166
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak?

962
01:14:24,648 --> 01:14:25,909
[SPEAKER_42]: We have a motion.

963
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:27,871
[SPEAKER_42]: We have an amendment.

964
01:14:28,571 --> 01:14:32,855
[SPEAKER_42]: Well, we need a motion on the original paper that's been amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Seng.

996
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:38,333
[SPEAKER_42]: trainings that provide incorrect information to poll wardens and workers and also the paper has been disposed of so i'm reading it back as a courtesy there's no more public comment on this paper the paper has been disposed of so i'm reading it back as a courtesy i'm reading it back as a courtesy you're welcome to stay to public participation in the meeting but i'm reading this back as a courtesy there's no more public comment on this paper it's been disposed of because we voted on it

997
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:41,011
[SPEAKER_25]: So voter integrity means nothing.

998
01:16:41,191 --> 01:16:41,651
[SPEAKER_42]: As I said.

999
01:16:41,812 --> 01:16:42,212
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1000
01:16:42,452 --> 01:16:44,033
[SPEAKER_42]: I'll continue reading because you asked for it.

1001
01:16:44,913 --> 01:16:52,878
[SPEAKER_42]: Voters bring materials to assist them in the voting booth and persistent issues with the counting of ballots in a timely manner and release of incomplete unofficial election results to the public.

1002
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:59,322
[SPEAKER_42]: Be it further resolved that the mayor provide the council with a supplemental appropriation request to restore full-time staffing levels in the elections department.

1003
01:16:59,802 --> 01:17:04,825
[SPEAKER_42]: And then that was combined with councilor Scarpelli's paper that said be it resolved the election coordinator report back to the city council

1004
01:17:05,505 --> 01:17:12,872
[SPEAKER_42]: with a detailed report and findings detailing the municipal election, which includes but is not limited to absentee ballots, polling rules, and regulations, complaints, and malfunctions.

1005
01:17:13,452 --> 01:17:20,359
[SPEAKER_42]: Scarpelli amended to ask for elections to direct the commissioner, can't remember my own writing, to explain in detail.

1006
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:22,280
[SPEAKER_42]: Can you read that amendment?

1007
01:17:29,706 --> 01:17:31,827
[SPEAKER_38]: It was an amendment about sending a letter to the Secretary of State's office.

1008
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:32,588
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, sorry, that was a letter.

1009
01:17:32,608 --> 01:17:40,752
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, that was a letter to be sent to the Secretary of State, and then Councilor Sang further amended to ask for specific details related to funding and staffing related to the challenges.

1010
01:17:41,053 --> 01:17:45,535
[SPEAKER_42]: And that's what was voted on and approved 6-0-1 absent.

1011
01:17:46,256 --> 01:17:47,336
[SPEAKER_42]: But a motion from

1012
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:53,883
[SPEAKER_38]: Councilor, I believe it was Councilor Seng to revert with a second by Vice Mayor Behrs.

1013
01:17:54,043 --> 01:18:01,147
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Seng, seconded by Vice Mayor Behrs to revert to regular order of business, and now we're, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1014
01:18:02,528 --> 01:18:04,009
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Thomson?

1015
01:18:04,109 --> 01:18:04,369
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

1016
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:06,531
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Lange?

1017
01:18:16,417 --> 01:18:17,077
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Capelli?

1018
01:18:21,125 --> 01:18:22,849
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, uh, six in infirmary.

1019
01:18:22,869 --> 01:18:23,631
[SPEAKER_42]: Negative one absent.

1020
01:18:23,671 --> 01:18:24,112
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

1021
01:18:24,272 --> 01:18:25,655
[SPEAKER_42]: Running to regular order of business.

1022
01:18:33,722 --> 01:18:38,347
[SPEAKER_42]: 23-411, notice of a public hearing, Medford City Council, Chapter 94, Zone 8.

1023
01:18:38,968 --> 01:18:43,833
[SPEAKER_42]: The Medford City Council will conduct a public hearing on November 14, 2023 at 7 p.m.

1024
01:18:43,953 --> 01:18:54,083
[SPEAKER_42]: in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford, Mass, 02155, and via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to paper 23-411.

1025
01:18:55,765 --> 01:19:08,098
[SPEAKER_42]: also known as paper 23-407, a petition by the Medford Housing Authority to amend zoning map city of Medford, Mass., dated April 13, 1965, as referenced in Medford Zoning Ordinance Chapter 94-2.2.

1026
01:19:08,258 --> 01:19:16,727
[SPEAKER_42]: The amendment proposes to change the zoning district designation of the property of 1-20 Waffling Court as depicted on sheets 1-6 of the plans entitled

1027
01:19:17,204 --> 01:19:30,693
[SPEAKER_42]: ALTA NSPS land title survey prepared by Fuss and O'Neill and dated February 6, 2022 from apartment one zoning district to a planned development district, which would have a new development standard per Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94-9.2.3.

1028
01:19:30,793 --> 01:19:35,877
[SPEAKER_42]: A Zoom link for this meeting will be posted no later than November 10th, 2023.

1029
01:19:38,477 --> 01:19:42,539
[SPEAKER_42]: For additional information, aids and accommodations, call the Medford City Clerk's Office at 781-393-2425, TDD 781-393-2516.

1030

[SPEAKER_42]: The full materials of the amendment can be viewed

1031
01:19:49,675 --> 01:20:01,277
[SPEAKER_42]: in the office of the city clerk, Medford City Hall, room 103, or on the city's website at medfordma.org, slash department, slash planning, dash development, dash sustainability, by clicking on current city board filings.

1032
01:20:01,498 --> 01:20:10,740
[SPEAKER_42]: Advertised in the Medford Transcript and Somerville Journal, September 14th and 21st, 2023, by order of the Medford city clerk, signed Adam L. Hurtubise, city clerk.

1033
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,640
[SPEAKER_42]: We do have the petitioner here.

1034
01:20:13,220 --> 01:20:17,422
[SPEAKER_42]: Just for an update on this process, this has been many months of public meetings.

1035
01:20:17,502 --> 01:20:24,444
[SPEAKER_42]: I think we have had a number of committees of the whole on this, some by statute that we had to have, some we just had as informational.

1036
01:20:25,284 --> 01:20:28,085
[SPEAKER_42]: This was brought to the council earlier.

1037
01:20:28,146 --> 01:20:32,307
[SPEAKER_42]: This was reported out to the CD board and their recommendation was, I believe it was 5-0.

1038
01:20:32,347 --> 01:20:33,047
[SPEAKER_42]: I can pull it up.

1039
01:20:33,527 --> 01:20:34,248
[SPEAKER_42]: It was 5-0.

1040
01:20:37,537 --> 01:20:40,119
[SPEAKER_42]: So again, what is before us tonight is zoning.

1041
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:44,021
[SPEAKER_42]: I believe Director Hunt, she's not here.

1042
01:20:44,041 --> 01:20:44,942
[SPEAKER_42]: It's Danielle.

1043
01:20:45,042 --> 01:20:46,142
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, there you are.

1044
01:20:46,222 --> 01:20:55,708
[SPEAKER_42]: If you want to just remind us, so the plan development district is a process that was added when we did the zoning recodification that was passed last March.

1045
01:20:55,748 --> 01:20:57,269
[SPEAKER_42]: So it's a relatively new process.

1046
01:20:57,309 --> 01:21:03,113
[SPEAKER_42]: So if Director Hunt could give us a brief reminder of the steps of this process, then I think we can go to the petitioner.

1047
01:21:04,074 --> 01:21:06,075
[SPEAKER_42]: And then I know a lot of folks want

1048
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:07,701
[SPEAKER_42]: speak on this as well.

1049
01:21:07,761 --> 01:21:09,301
[SPEAKER_42]: So we'll go to Director Hunt first.

1050
01:21:10,122 --> 01:21:11,223
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President.

1051
01:21:11,603 --> 01:21:15,185
[SPEAKER_15]: Alicia Hunt, Director of Planning, Development, and Sustainability for the City.

1052
01:21:15,345 --> 01:21:18,246
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm here tonight with Senior Planner Danielle Evans.

1053
01:21:19,287 --> 01:21:33,755
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is a method that is relatively new, but it's gone through the City Council once before about how we change zoning for a specific planned development district for a specific location when presented with a project that

1054
01:21:34,243 --> 01:21:39,066
[SPEAKER_15]: make sense to the city, make sense within our plans.

1055
01:21:40,747 --> 01:22:01,520
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've submitted from the CD board actually a memo that talks about the various climate action and adaptation plan, comprehensive plan, the housing, sorry, production plan, and how this, that they considered all of those in their recommendation that this fits with us.

1056
01:22:02,021 --> 01:22:03,562
[SPEAKER_15]: At this time, this is,

1057
01:22:04,412 --> 01:22:10,656
[SPEAKER_15]: had its original referral from this board, which was a required referral to the CD board for recommendation.

1058
01:22:11,177 --> 01:22:13,078
[SPEAKER_15]: CD board conducted a public hearing.

1059
01:22:13,499 --> 01:22:18,762
[SPEAKER_15]: You have a memo that senior planner, Daniel Evans drafted for you about the recommendations.

1060
01:22:18,862 --> 01:22:27,469
[SPEAKER_15]: And she's here if you wanted her to speak to that or to more detail about what the community development board discussed at that meeting, or I can as well.

1061
01:22:28,749 --> 01:22:33,593
[SPEAKER_15]: At this time, if you were to approve this, this would be for the zoning.

1062
01:22:34,062 --> 01:22:47,107
[SPEAKER_15]: The next step would be that the housing, sorry, the housing authority, I apologize, you had a long meeting, but I sat in a three-hour traffic commission meeting immediately before this, so my brain is also catching up.

1063
01:22:49,028 --> 01:22:58,472
[SPEAKER_15]: So the housing authority would still need to apply for a special permit for the construction of these projects, and during that time would go through

1064
01:22:59,083 --> 01:23:00,884
[SPEAKER_15]: a site plan review process.

1065
01:23:01,284 --> 01:23:08,948
[SPEAKER_15]: So I will point out that there are a number of concerns around things like traffic, circulation, and trees, et cetera.

1066
01:23:09,468 --> 01:23:14,451
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are items that are addressed during site plan review and would be thoroughly vetted at that time.

1067
01:23:14,471 --> 01:23:26,377
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not saying you shouldn't or can't consider those, but this is really about the height, the density, this is about the zoning of this, and those details like zoning does not really address trees.

1068
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:29,345
[SPEAKER_15]: but site plan review does and access.

1069
01:23:31,046 --> 01:23:32,988
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's where we stand with this this evening.

1070
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:40,774
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a number of members of the housing authority team here tonight to speak to you about this, unless you have any other questions about the process.

1071
01:23:40,874 --> 01:23:47,359
[SPEAKER_15]: And Danielle and I are here both to speak to the process and to the city board's considerations during their public meeting.

1072
01:23:48,299 --> 01:23:49,300
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1073
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,222
[SPEAKER_42]: Are there any questions from councilors at this time?

1074
01:23:52,618 --> 01:23:58,282
[SPEAKER_42]: I think just, I'm going to describe really just quickly, just so we, I think just cause this is a public hearing.

1075
01:23:58,322 --> 01:23:59,423
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have to run a specific way.

1076
01:23:59,443 --> 01:24:00,984
[SPEAKER_42]: I think we'll take questions from counselors.

1077
01:24:01,024 --> 01:24:04,266
[SPEAKER_42]: If we haven't this time, we'll go to the petitioner, any additional questions.

1078
01:24:04,866 --> 01:24:06,307
[SPEAKER_42]: Then we open up the public hearing.

1079
01:24:06,327 --> 01:24:07,989
[SPEAKER_42]: I know there's lots of folks who want to speak.

1080
01:24:08,089 --> 01:24:11,351
[SPEAKER_42]: That is the time to speak either in favor and opposition.

1081
01:24:11,371 --> 01:24:20,177
[SPEAKER_42]: I know sometimes there is some nuance in between, but pick a time so we can, we can lodge your comments and then we will,

1082
01:24:20,971 --> 01:24:22,152
[SPEAKER_42]: see if we have a motion for a vote.

1083
01:24:22,172 --> 01:24:25,293
[SPEAKER_42]: So just so folks know the process we're gonna go through.

1084
01:24:25,313 --> 01:24:27,875
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Spadafore, do you have a question for right now?

1085
01:24:28,055 --> 01:24:48,226
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah, I think the biggest concern that I have is, as we're talking, as we're seeing some of the new changes we're seeing and some of the development that we're seeing, one constant comes back to me from neighbors and residents that they shared what I felt was an issue was that

1086
01:24:49,513 --> 01:24:52,294
[SPEAKER_36]: As we're moving forward with these zoning changes, we see that they're important.

1087
01:24:52,314 --> 01:24:53,755
[SPEAKER_36]: We see that they can be successful.

1088
01:24:54,415 --> 01:25:01,159
[SPEAKER_36]: What we don't have, though, is proper notification when we do certain jobs in our community.

1089
01:25:02,379 --> 01:25:08,022
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't think we do a very good job informing our constituents of projects that are coming about.

1090
01:25:08,042 --> 01:25:11,744
[SPEAKER_36]: I'll use Mystic Ave as an example.

1091
01:25:12,964 --> 01:25:19,007
[SPEAKER_36]: That evening, we talked about a building that sounds great, but I posed it for the fact that

1092
01:25:20,497 --> 01:25:27,578
[SPEAKER_36]: it right now, it's a unicorn, and I didn't get any answer from the administration of what the vision is for that area.

1093
01:25:28,718 --> 01:25:38,260
[SPEAKER_36]: No different than what's happening over at the old KISS 108 site at the T building in Wellington, that the building's being razed and we still have no vision.

1094
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:43,261
[SPEAKER_36]: Now, that's very close to having two gateways of our community.

1095
01:25:44,061 --> 01:25:48,782
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think that moving forward with any more zoning is, to me,

1096
01:25:50,577 --> 01:25:54,619
[SPEAKER_36]: is a slippery slope to the fact that we're not letting our constituents know.

1097
01:25:54,899 --> 01:26:01,222
[SPEAKER_36]: There are some projects that organizations, I'll give you an example with our housing.

1098
01:26:02,283 --> 01:26:12,208
[SPEAKER_36]: There have been multiple meetings, multiple neighbors, opportunities for people to speak on different projects.

1099
01:26:13,569 --> 01:26:15,730
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't think we see that too often.

1100
01:26:16,457 --> 01:26:20,920
[SPEAKER_36]: when it comes to some of these positions and some of these projects.

1101
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:37,009
[SPEAKER_36]: And I tell you, I think when we talked about putting together the zoning study and having that bring that team in that will go neighborhood to neighborhood, remember we talked about that and getting the idea of the residents of what people want Medford to look like.

1102
01:26:38,047 --> 01:26:39,668
[SPEAKER_36]: It seems like we forgot that.

1103
01:26:39,968 --> 01:26:41,229
[SPEAKER_36]: We're not doing that anymore.

1104
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:43,530
[SPEAKER_36]: That's been put in the back burner.

1105
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:44,851
[SPEAKER_36]: Well, we haven't done anything.

1106
01:26:46,072 --> 01:26:52,996
[SPEAKER_36]: We're coming up with new zoning changes and we're saying, well, we could do this now because this might work.

1107
01:26:54,037 --> 01:26:59,820
[SPEAKER_36]: But in totality, we still don't have a plan and we still aren't including all of our residents.

1108
01:27:00,741 --> 01:27:01,981
[SPEAKER_36]: So, and I think that's a concern.

1109
01:27:02,882 --> 01:27:03,142
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1110
01:27:05,904 --> 01:27:09,068
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want to speak to the notification for this?

1111
01:27:09,328 --> 01:27:10,790
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to misspeak.

1112
01:27:11,551 --> 01:27:15,555
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a notification process for public hearings, but I don't want to misspeak to it.

1113
01:27:15,776 --> 01:27:16,637
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know?

1114
01:27:18,859 --> 01:27:20,021
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, good evening.

1115
01:27:20,061 --> 01:27:21,402
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Danielle Evans, senior planner.

1116
01:27:22,884 --> 01:27:25,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you talking about the notification for the project in general or?

1117
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:27,620
[SPEAKER_11]: for the rezoning?

1118
01:27:27,861 --> 01:27:30,382
[SPEAKER_36]: I think for any projects.

1119
01:27:30,602 --> 01:27:32,443
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, for anything that's going on in the city.

1120
01:27:32,463 --> 01:27:35,864
[SPEAKER_36]: I've been getting phone calls, I get 45 phone calls, it's something we're gonna talk about later.

1121
01:27:36,384 --> 01:27:55,453
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that- So this actual, this project's been, when the CPC and then when you're on real body approved the funding for CPA funds, one of the conditions that the CPC placed on it is that there be a very robust public input process

1122
01:27:56,295 --> 01:28:03,199
[SPEAKER_11]: and they built that into their budget for multiple, multiple meetings.

1123
01:28:03,299 --> 01:28:07,701
[SPEAKER_11]: I went to several of them on my own time in the evening just to see what was going on there.

1124
01:28:07,761 --> 01:28:11,263
[SPEAKER_11]: They had some for residents, some for the butters.

1125
01:28:12,204 --> 01:28:14,945
[SPEAKER_11]: Gabe could speak to how many there were.

1126
01:28:14,965 --> 01:28:16,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I didn't make it to all of them.

1127
01:28:18,067 --> 01:28:20,448
[SPEAKER_11]: But for that, there were many, many meetings.

1128
01:28:20,468 --> 01:28:23,370
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't do mailings for this one, for this site plan.

1129
01:28:24,609 --> 01:28:40,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, for site plan review and for the special permit is when all of the butters are noticed, but for zoning change, it's, you know, two ads run the paper, you post the public hearing notice, and it goes to, there's a list of different bodies that it goes to.

1130
01:28:42,969 --> 01:28:57,702
[SPEAKER_15]: I might add, there are a lot of people who have been to public meetings of this and who are here this evening to speak on this, so in my impression, they must have heard about this, so the public notification must be working because people know about this.

1131
01:28:58,122 --> 01:29:05,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Every time they call you upset about something we're doing, it actually indicates that they know about it, so.

1132
01:29:05,815 --> 01:29:34,181
[SPEAKER_36]: And what I'll do is I'll ask, what I'll do is I'll ask a request because I think what's getting out, because if you ask, there's a demographic that if you look at all the surveys and there's a demographic that gets the information and it seems to be one demographic, there's a lot of people, if you ask the common person in this room that's not involved with this, they've never heard anything about this because the message is getting out to the people that it seems like that are pinpointed to

1133
01:29:34,714 --> 01:29:40,356
[SPEAKER_36]: direct mailers or groups.

1134
01:29:40,696 --> 01:29:43,476
[SPEAKER_36]: So that's the problem.

1135
01:29:43,796 --> 01:29:46,197
[SPEAKER_36]: When I say this project, I'm saying as a whole.

1136
01:29:47,377 --> 01:29:59,541
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm having calls from as a whole when we're talking about different surveys and things being done around the community and your office getting back to people and saying, oh no, we sent it out.

1137
01:29:59,701 --> 01:30:02,261
[SPEAKER_36]: And there are times that I'm in those same neighborhoods.

1138
01:30:02,361 --> 01:30:03,062
[SPEAKER_36]: I didn't get anything.

1139
01:30:03,102 --> 01:30:03,882
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm a city councilor.

1140
01:30:04,522 --> 01:30:11,388
[SPEAKER_36]: So that I can't, I can't not listen or bring forth what my constituents are bringing to me.

1141
01:30:11,988 --> 01:30:12,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1142
01:30:12,409 --> 01:30:19,635
[SPEAKER_15]: And anytime any of your constituents have suggestions about better ways that we can notify short of us knocking on everybody's door.

1143
01:30:19,655 --> 01:30:20,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1144
01:30:20,515 --> 01:30:25,480
[SPEAKER_15]: I, we are very open to where else can, how else can we put the word about these?

1145
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:28,442
[SPEAKER_15]: Where else can we, and I will mention that

1146
01:30:28,893 --> 01:30:31,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Paper mailing the entire city costs about $18,000.

1147
01:30:31,235 --> 01:30:34,398
[SPEAKER_36]: So let's talk about what we talked about.

1148
01:30:34,978 --> 01:30:44,446
[SPEAKER_36]: Something that we were very excited about is hiring that zoning team and then bringing our vision of our development, our growth in our community.

1149
01:30:44,466 --> 01:30:48,749
[SPEAKER_36]: Remember, going neighborhood to neighborhood, involving everyone.

1150
01:30:50,871 --> 01:30:51,071
[SPEAKER_36]: Right?

1151
01:30:51,531 --> 01:30:52,771
[SPEAKER_36]: Having community meetings.

1152
01:30:52,812 --> 01:30:53,892
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't afford that.

1153
01:30:54,132 --> 01:30:55,372
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't afford that.

1154
01:30:55,492 --> 01:31:01,234
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you would really like us to do it that way, but we're going to have to have more than $100,000 to do it.

1155
01:31:01,274 --> 01:31:05,655
[SPEAKER_15]: That's very expensive.

1156
01:31:05,995 --> 01:31:07,315
[SPEAKER_15]: We requested it.

1157
01:31:07,755 --> 01:31:09,956
[SPEAKER_36]: This council requested it.

1158
01:31:10,236 --> 01:31:10,796
[SPEAKER_36]: It's not us.

1159
01:31:11,156 --> 01:31:12,256
[SPEAKER_36]: This council has requested it.

1160
01:31:13,197 --> 01:31:13,497
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1161
01:31:14,777 --> 01:31:18,558
[SPEAKER_42]: At this point, we want to go to the petitioner, unless there's any other

1162
01:31:21,593 --> 01:31:38,484
[SPEAKER_42]: Gabriel, you're going to have to talk.

1163
01:31:48,487 --> 01:31:52,488
[SPEAKER_27]: Madam President, City Councilors, I have a presentation.

1164
01:31:52,988 --> 01:31:57,089
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm Gabe Ciccarello.

1165
01:31:57,289 --> 01:32:08,592
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm the Director of Modernization and Procurement with the Medford Housing Authority, and I'm here to present the redevelopment of Guam Court.

1166
01:32:10,265 --> 01:32:12,206
[SPEAKER_27]: Can I be able to share?

1167
01:32:12,386 --> 01:32:16,267
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, can you make Gabe, I assume it's your teacher, Garello?

1168
01:32:17,147 --> 01:32:17,527
[SPEAKER_42]: That's you?

1169
01:32:17,767 --> 01:32:18,247
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

1170
01:32:18,327 --> 01:32:18,887
[SPEAKER_40]: The co-host.

1171
01:32:30,151 --> 01:32:30,891
[SPEAKER_39]: Should have it now.

1172
01:32:31,011 --> 01:32:31,091
[SPEAKER_39]: OK.

1173
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:40,370
[SPEAKER_26]: One second.

1174
01:32:55,638 --> 01:32:56,679
[SPEAKER_26]: Let's see the screen now.

1175
01:33:00,180 --> 01:33:06,724
[SPEAKER_27]: So we have a very deep, dedicated, mission-driven team here with us.

1176
01:33:08,295 --> 01:33:10,016
[SPEAKER_27]: Jeff Driscoll is our executive director.

1177
01:33:10,936 --> 01:33:21,142
[SPEAKER_27]: We are using the Cambridge Housing Authority as a development consultant and also an owner's project manager when we come to construction.

1178
01:33:21,782 --> 01:33:26,445
[SPEAKER_27]: Our counsel is Nolan Sheehan-Patton, and Hannah Kilson is here with me tonight.

1179
01:33:26,525 --> 01:33:29,006
[SPEAKER_27]: She's going to assist me as we get further into the presentation.

1180
01:33:30,247 --> 01:33:36,210
[SPEAKER_27]: Our architect is Dietz and Company, and Danny Gerpal-Attisha is here representing Dietz.

1181
01:33:36,884 --> 01:33:39,067
[SPEAKER_27]: And our civil engineer is Faustin O'Neill.

1182
01:33:39,167 --> 01:33:39,727
[SPEAKER_27]: They are here.

1183
01:33:40,188 --> 01:33:43,532
[SPEAKER_27]: And our traffic engineer, who performed the traffic study, is Mitch Engineer.

1184
01:33:45,934 --> 01:33:51,160
[SPEAKER_27]: So through this presentation, I'm just going to give you a brief overview of the walking court development.

1185
01:33:51,661 --> 01:33:56,747
[SPEAKER_27]: Then I'm going to turn it over to Hannah to discuss the PDD process and our requesting zoning amendment.

1186
01:33:58,447 --> 01:34:07,210
[SPEAKER_27]: So, Whatling Court is currently, it's 144 units of state-aided public housing for low-income seniors and disabled households.

1187
01:34:08,651 --> 01:34:14,213
[SPEAKER_27]: All the units are deeply affordable with our residents' rents calculated 30% of their income.

1188
01:34:16,053 --> 01:34:22,576
[SPEAKER_27]: Historically and to date, Whatling Court has not received sufficient operating substate to address its physical needs.

1189
01:34:23,686 --> 01:34:28,207
[SPEAKER_27]: It was built in 1963 and suffers from two key deficiencies.

1190
01:34:29,027 --> 01:34:33,728
[SPEAKER_27]: There's some pictures to the right of just your typical existing conditions within the buildings.

1191
01:34:34,788 --> 01:34:45,971
[SPEAKER_27]: And one of the biggest things is that it lacks accessibility features for seniors and disabled households as they're two-story walk-up garden flat style buildings with no elevators.

1192
01:34:45,991 --> 01:34:50,932
[SPEAKER_27]: So half of our senior disabled residents need to access stairs to get to their units.

1193
01:34:53,153 --> 01:34:56,076
[SPEAKER_27]: This is a bird's eye view of the Walkman Court development.

1194
01:34:56,877 --> 01:35:01,922
[SPEAKER_27]: As you can see, it's bordered and adjacent to some interesting properties.

1195
01:35:02,282 --> 01:35:05,765
[SPEAKER_27]: To the west, it's a commercial site with Whole Foods and Starbucks.

1196
01:35:07,747 --> 01:35:16,596
[SPEAKER_27]: To the south, we have kind of a more industrial commercial space with Elizabeth Grady, their mid-rise style buildings, commercial office space and lab space.

1197
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:22,916
[SPEAKER_27]: To the north, there's a couple of residential homes, and then the Mystic River Reservation amenity.

1198
01:35:23,857 --> 01:35:29,102
[SPEAKER_27]: And to the east is your typical Medford two-family and single-family homes.

1199
01:35:30,963 --> 01:35:40,692
[SPEAKER_27]: To the top right here, this is a picture to the entrance of Walkman Court from Auburn Street, looking down towards the Auburn North Street intersection.

1200
01:35:42,529 --> 01:35:48,034
[SPEAKER_27]: This next picture to the bottom is from the North Street Bridge looking west.

1201
01:35:48,374 --> 01:35:52,697
[SPEAKER_27]: You can see across the train tracks, there's a mid-rise commercial type buildings.

1202
01:35:53,378 --> 01:35:58,042
[SPEAKER_27]: And to the right, you can see our two-story walk-up garden flat buildings.

1203
01:35:58,802 --> 01:36:05,348
[SPEAKER_27]: And to the top left is to the west of our property that shows the Whole Foods building, the Whole Foods parking lot.

1204
01:36:07,521 --> 01:36:12,386
[SPEAKER_27]: The picture to the right here is what the proposed redevelopment we hope to look like.

1205
01:36:12,486 --> 01:36:18,211
[SPEAKER_27]: And this is an elevated view from around the intersection of North Street and Auburn Street.

1206
01:36:20,833 --> 01:36:24,197
[SPEAKER_27]: We're proposing five structures on the site.

1207
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:32,475
[SPEAKER_27]: Three of them to the north of the site and east of the site are two-story townhouse buildings.

1208
01:36:33,076 --> 01:36:37,819
[SPEAKER_27]: To the west of the site, we're proposing a four-story family mid-rise building.

1209
01:36:37,939 --> 01:36:45,865
[SPEAKER_27]: Three of those stories would be residential, and the ground floor would be podium parking and a couple common area spaces.

1210
01:36:46,849 --> 01:37:03,348
[SPEAKER_27]: And then scaling up towards the south of the site where the adjacency is mid-rise buildings, we're looking to put a six-story elderly disabled elevator building with podium parking on the first floor and then five stories of residential units.

1211
01:37:04,207 --> 01:37:14,590
[SPEAKER_27]: So the goals of the redevelopment is, number one, is to provide high quality, accessible, and deeply affordable units to our existing 144 units that are on site.

1212
01:37:15,050 --> 01:37:21,593
[SPEAKER_27]: But we're also looking to build 94 net new, deeply affordable units within that site.

1213
01:37:22,653 --> 01:37:28,735
[SPEAKER_27]: And 54 of those would be elderly disabled units, and 40 of those would be family units.

1214
01:37:30,391 --> 01:37:37,174
[SPEAKER_27]: We're looking to improve the resiliency and sustainability to this site, and then improve the site's connection to the surrounding neighborhood.

1215
01:37:37,694 --> 01:37:41,355
[SPEAKER_27]: This site is existing, has a decent connection to the neighborhood.

1216
01:37:41,375 --> 01:37:49,018
[SPEAKER_27]: It's used a lot as a walkthrough for people coming from Boston Ave to connect to Whole Foods, and we are looking to improve upon that with this new design.

1217
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:53,360
[SPEAKER_27]: And the redevelopment of Walking Foot is a local priority.

1218
01:37:53,940 --> 01:37:57,842
[SPEAKER_27]: So the replacement of the 144 units and construction of new units

1219
01:37:58,804 --> 01:38:07,628
[SPEAKER_27]: is included in the fiscal year 21 through 25 city of Medford's housing production plan as a strategy to help meet the city's housing goals.

1220
01:38:08,388 --> 01:38:18,713
[SPEAKER_27]: And again, all units during the redevelopment after development would remain deeply affordable with residents' rents limited to 30% of their income.

1221
01:38:20,834 --> 01:38:22,415
[SPEAKER_27]: To the left here is just the,

1222
01:38:23,667 --> 01:38:46,232
[SPEAKER_27]: sketch of the site plan showing the senior mid-rise building is a larger building A, then there's the smaller mid-rise family buildings, building B, and then the three townhouse buildings, which would be C, D, and E. And to the right here, the top right picture is a rendering of what the proposed dedicated senior outdoor space would look like.

1223
01:38:46,712 --> 01:38:49,933
[SPEAKER_27]: They currently at Walkling Court have a really nice community garden.

1224
01:38:49,953 --> 01:38:51,233
[SPEAKER_27]: We look to incorporate that.

1225
01:38:51,993 --> 01:38:54,156
[SPEAKER_27]: is have a really nice dedicated senior space.

1226
01:38:54,656 --> 01:39:01,904
[SPEAKER_27]: And the bottom picture to the right is what the site would look like coming in off of Auburn Street and during Walkland Court.

1227
01:39:02,005 --> 01:39:05,709
[SPEAKER_27]: So to the east, you have the townhouse type buildings.

1228
01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:09,413
[SPEAKER_27]: To the west, you'd have the family mid-rise.

1229
01:39:09,553 --> 01:39:12,837
[SPEAKER_27]: And straight down to the south would be the senior mid-rise building.

1230
01:39:15,636 --> 01:39:21,138
[SPEAKER_27]: So an overview of what we've done during the resident and neighborhood engagement process.

1231
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:26,440
[SPEAKER_27]: So we've had a very active and well-attended resident and neighborhood engagement process.

1232
01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:32,082
[SPEAKER_27]: At the time of submitting this PDV application, we've held seven resident meetings.

1233
01:39:32,522 --> 01:39:35,103
[SPEAKER_27]: We held five full community meetings.

1234
01:39:35,903 --> 01:39:41,365
[SPEAKER_27]: Before we started the full community process, we also held a meeting with the Director Butters to Walkman Court.

1235
01:39:43,453 --> 01:40:00,963
[SPEAKER_27]: This is just a map of what the legal notifications in the yellow, we were legally had to mail out notifications within 400 feet, but we also flyered for every meeting within that area and we went past that area out to West Street, Lyman Ave and Boston Ave.

1236
01:40:01,803 --> 01:40:06,346
[SPEAKER_27]: We also posted notices within and around the walk-in court site.

1237
01:40:07,922 --> 01:40:16,609
[SPEAKER_27]: The MHA has met with a variety of city departments, almost all city departments now, including the fire department, building department, and DPW.

1238
01:40:17,209 --> 01:40:24,235
[SPEAKER_27]: And we've also had the public meetings for the Community Preservation Act funding that we've submitted for.

1239
01:40:26,236 --> 01:40:36,825
[SPEAKER_27]: During the resident and community engagement process, some of the key topics that came up were density and height and increasing

1240
01:40:38,038 --> 01:40:41,639
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just gonna block this, I can't see this real quick, sorry.

1241
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:52,361
[SPEAKER_27]: Increasing the number of affordable housing at Whatcom Court, again, as identified as a strategy in the city's fiscal year 21 through 25 housing production plan.

1242
01:40:53,041 --> 01:41:04,064
[SPEAKER_27]: And the 94 net new units is expected to increase the number of actual residents on site by about 101%, not the number of units, but the number of residents on site by about 101%.

1243
01:41:05,891 --> 01:41:08,693
[SPEAKER_27]: And the senior mid-rise, again, is a five-story building.

1244
01:41:08,713 --> 01:41:15,938
[SPEAKER_27]: Senior mid-rise, five stories, living space, and then the covered podium parking on the ground floor.

1245
01:41:17,499 --> 01:41:25,925
[SPEAKER_27]: A key goal of this project, again, is to provide elevated access to seniors and disabled residents, and also families in the mid-rise building.

1246
01:41:25,965 --> 01:41:30,028
[SPEAKER_27]: There is a high need for handicap-assessable family housing.

1247
01:41:31,303 --> 01:41:41,947
[SPEAKER_27]: And we're trying to work efficient building footprints with the height to allow for more programmable interior space and more kind of accessible, usable open space on the site.

1248
01:41:42,907 --> 01:41:53,891
[SPEAKER_27]: And again, the building types reflect, we try to reflect the adjacency around the site to the proximity and adjacency to the buildings.

1249
01:41:55,212 --> 01:41:58,093
[SPEAKER_27]: One of the questions that has come up is the proximity to the trains.

1250
01:41:59,418 --> 01:42:00,719
[SPEAKER_27]: to the commuter rail line.

1251
01:42:00,999 --> 01:42:06,663
[SPEAKER_27]: And the site and facade is designed to meet HUD noise requirements using high-performance windows and insulation.

1252
01:42:07,163 --> 01:42:14,428
[SPEAKER_27]: We've onboarded an acoustical engineer that will stay on the project team during design development, during construction.

1253
01:42:14,448 --> 01:42:20,972
[SPEAKER_27]: And actually, the noise on this site currently will be greatly improved from its current situation.

1254
01:42:21,692 --> 01:42:28,777
[SPEAKER_27]: And all the new buildings will have mechanical ventilation installed and have centralized heating and cooling.

1255
01:42:30,198 --> 01:42:42,763
[SPEAKER_27]: And there's many examples of comparable development going on adjacent to railroad tracks, especially with market rate housing, mid-rise buildings being built along Boston Avenue and Somerville.

1256
01:42:44,468 --> 01:42:47,410
[SPEAKER_27]: There's been a question about having an access road through the site.

1257
01:42:47,450 --> 01:42:50,993
[SPEAKER_27]: We're looking, right now there's two entry points to get into.

1258
01:42:51,013 --> 01:42:55,816
[SPEAKER_27]: There's two separate entry points to get into Walkman Court, and we're looking to make it through street.

1259
01:42:56,677 --> 01:43:02,762
[SPEAKER_27]: And that access road would provide residents and visitors access to all of the buildings within the site.

1260
01:43:03,562 --> 01:43:08,546
[SPEAKER_27]: It would ensure emergency access, and it's been reviewed and recommended by the fire department.

1261
01:43:09,557 --> 01:43:13,758
[SPEAKER_27]: And of course, it would be designed to ensure pedestrian safety with traffic calming measures.

1262
01:43:14,459 --> 01:43:23,622
[SPEAKER_27]: And the parking that we have planned is based on usage for low-income seniors and families, and the parking need will be met on site.

1263
01:43:24,122 --> 01:43:30,064
[SPEAKER_27]: Residents living within the walkway development not have to go and park outside of the development.

1264
01:43:31,765 --> 01:43:35,326
[SPEAKER_27]: We've had the traffic survey done by Niche Engineering.

1265
01:43:35,386 --> 01:43:39,007
[SPEAKER_27]: It's determined that no traffic mitigation measures will be warranted.

1266
01:43:39,957 --> 01:43:41,198
[SPEAKER_27]: And then environmental issues.

1267
01:43:41,238 --> 01:43:45,120
[SPEAKER_27]: We've conducted a phase one and phase two environmental site assessment.

1268
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:50,943
[SPEAKER_27]: Any asbestos remediation and soil removal would meet state and federal requirements.

1269
01:43:51,663 --> 01:43:56,526
[SPEAKER_27]: And all construction activities will be monitored to ensure that hazardous materials are properly handled.

1270
01:43:57,446 --> 01:44:05,491
[SPEAKER_27]: And no environmental impact statement is required because no Mass Environmental Protection Act thresholds have been exceeded or are exceeded.

1271
01:44:05,591 --> 01:44:07,952
[SPEAKER_27]: Now I'm gonna turn it over to Hannah.

1272
01:44:12,808 --> 01:44:13,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

1273
01:44:13,489 --> 01:44:14,749
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Hannah Kilson.

1274
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:20,893
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a partner at the law firm of Nolan Sheehan Patent, 84 State Street in Boston.

1275
01:44:21,033 --> 01:44:24,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President and counselors this evening.

1276
01:44:24,936 --> 01:44:30,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to walk through with you the proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance.

1277
01:44:30,839 --> 01:44:40,065
[SPEAKER_07]: What is being proposed this evening by Medford Housing Authority is to adopt what we are calling the PDD 3 amendment, which would create

1278
01:44:40,699 --> 01:44:45,844
[SPEAKER_07]: a planned residential development district within Medford.

1279
01:44:47,625 --> 01:44:51,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Gabe, I'm going to let you.

1280
01:44:51,508 --> 01:44:53,090
[SPEAKER_07]: So Gabe had, if you can go back.

1281
01:44:53,170 --> 01:44:59,395
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first one, just talk about this planned development district would require an amendment of the zoning map.

1282
01:45:00,456 --> 01:45:02,578
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would require an amendment of the zoning map

1283
01:45:03,387 --> 01:45:06,068
[SPEAKER_07]: to situate this parcel, as we noted.

1284
01:45:06,849 --> 01:45:10,750
[SPEAKER_07]: The southeast portion of this parcel is bordered by North Street.

1285
01:45:11,591 --> 01:45:25,236
[SPEAKER_07]: The south portion of the parcel is bordered by an industrial district, which on across the railroad tracks sits the Tufts Engineering Education and Outreach Program.

1286
01:45:25,857 --> 01:45:28,778
[SPEAKER_07]: To the west of the parcel will sit

1287
01:45:29,867 --> 01:45:42,457
[SPEAKER_07]: the commercial district, which is currently occupied by Whole Foods Market, and then towards the north and the northeast is an apartment one district, which as was noted, has single family homes and two family homes.

1288
01:45:42,918 --> 01:45:49,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the first portion is to amend the zoning map to allow a PDD three district in this area.

1289
01:45:49,663 --> 01:45:56,809
[SPEAKER_07]: The zoning amendment under the PDD three contains certain general provisions that relate to

1290
01:45:57,605 --> 01:46:06,757
[SPEAKER_07]: special permit process, the site plan process, which will occur through the Community Development Board and then the special permit granting authorities, this council here.

1291
01:46:08,299 --> 01:46:16,409
[SPEAKER_07]: We are also proposing that the special permit that we would obtain through this council would also be sufficient

1292
01:46:16,847 --> 01:46:26,797
[SPEAKER_07]: to qualify for the inclusionary housing provision special permit that's currently required under the zoning ordinance.

1293
01:46:27,518 --> 01:46:37,848
[SPEAKER_07]: The permitted uses for the project, you can see here up on the screen, this site will only have two types of permitted uses.

1294
01:46:38,432 --> 01:46:41,997
[SPEAKER_07]: One will be residential uses, and the other will be general office uses.

1295
01:46:42,758 --> 01:46:51,530
[SPEAKER_07]: The proposed amendment would make the uses as of right detached family dwellings, attached single family dwellings,

1296
01:46:52,014 --> 01:47:00,337
[SPEAKER_07]: detached two family dwellings, and multiple dwelling class A, multiple dwelling class B, and senior housing independent living.

1297
01:47:00,718 --> 01:47:14,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Those uses would be permitted as of right, whereas a special permit would be required from this city council for dormitory, lodging, boarding houses, and for any other type of senior facility.

1298
01:47:14,843 --> 01:47:18,665
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now on the site, as we noted, this site has been developed since 1963

1299
01:47:21,797 --> 01:47:32,864
[SPEAKER_07]: multifamily housing with nine buildings on the site, but the multiple dwelling houses greater than at 75 or six stories is not permitted as of right.

1300
01:47:33,704 --> 01:47:41,629
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that is one element of use that is needed in order for the development that's being proposed for Medford Housing Authority to be available.

1301
01:47:43,430 --> 01:47:47,713
[SPEAKER_07]: The next component of the proposed amendment is dimensional.

1302
01:47:49,493 --> 01:47:56,838
[SPEAKER_07]: So the proposed amendment would allow for more than one principal structure on the site, similar to what exists currently.

1303
01:47:57,398 --> 01:48:10,687
[SPEAKER_07]: It would provide that each of those structures on the site would have to be located at least 15 feet from another principal structure, which is similar to the current requirement under the existing zoning code.

1304
01:48:11,526 --> 01:48:28,015
[SPEAKER_07]: The dimensional standards that we're proposing here for this PDD are really consistent with what we think is both the intent of the PDD, which is to allow kind of flexibility for redevelopment of the Walkleen Court site in order to achieve a goal that clearly

1305
01:48:29,179 --> 01:48:40,189
[SPEAKER_07]: city has articulated in a number of its planning documents, which is to create more affordable housing, both for senior and disabled residents of Medford, but also for families.

1306
01:48:41,129 --> 01:48:46,574
[SPEAKER_07]: So the lot configuration that we would propose here for any lot that's located in

1307
01:48:48,055 --> 01:48:58,947
[SPEAKER_07]: the PDD 3, it would have minimum frontage of 35 feet, it would have minimum lot width of 35 feet, and it would have a minimum lot depth of 75 feet.

1308
01:49:00,449 --> 01:49:02,391
[SPEAKER_07]: The minimum lot area would be 10,000 square feet.

1309
01:49:04,753 --> 01:49:10,837
[SPEAKER_07]: and we would allow for a dwelling unit density of one unit per 750 square feet.

1310
01:49:10,897 --> 01:49:22,004
[SPEAKER_07]: So that expresses that we are looking to create a development density to achieve the objectives of more affordable housing available in the community.

1311
01:49:22,585 --> 01:49:25,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Maximum lot coverage, sorry, I can't see the screen from there.

1312
01:49:26,207 --> 01:49:28,709
[SPEAKER_07]: My eyesight's not good enough to follow that.

1313
01:49:29,129 --> 01:49:30,690
[SPEAKER_07]: The maximum lot coverage is 35%.

1314
01:49:32,748 --> 01:49:34,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Under current zoning, it's 30%.

1315
01:49:35,830 --> 01:49:43,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Landscape and usable open space, we are proposing in our amendment that that be 10% of the gross floor area.

1316
01:49:44,233 --> 01:50:01,729
[SPEAKER_07]: This space requirement would allow development density, again, that we think is consistent with the City of Medford's plan for this site and would enable us to build, help the City of Medford achieve its goal of 600 affordable housing units in fiscal year 2025.

1317
01:50:01,889 --> 01:50:09,115
[SPEAKER_07]: If the proposed redevelopment of Lockwood Court was allowed by special permit,

1318
01:50:09,533 --> 01:50:15,419
[SPEAKER_07]: The open space that we're proposing is, in fact, more accessible and more usable than the existing open space.

1319
01:50:16,099 --> 01:50:23,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, the landscaped open space here is 10%, and the current requirement for usable open space is 25%.

1320
01:50:23,326 --> 01:50:28,371
[SPEAKER_07]: Setbacks, the setbacks that we are proposing

1321
01:50:29,306 --> 01:50:36,810
[SPEAKER_07]: on the site is front yard of 15 feet, side yard of 10 feet, and rear yard of 15 feet.

1322
01:50:39,091 --> 01:50:51,157
[SPEAKER_07]: Given the typography, however, on North Street, the PDD amendment actually requires no setback for the parking spaces located in the front yard of any lot in the PDD 3 district.

1323
01:50:52,538 --> 01:50:57,180
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is consistent with the current circumstances of parking at the site.

1324
01:50:58,128 --> 01:50:59,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Maximum height and stories.

1325
01:51:00,310 --> 01:51:06,435
[SPEAKER_07]: In this PDD-3, the maximum height and stories really is dependent on the residential use.

1326
01:51:07,276 --> 01:51:26,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Here, where our intentions are multifamily and single-family attached, the maximum height would be 75 feet for multiple family housing in six stories, or it would be 35 feet in three stories for attached single-family dwellings.

1327
01:51:28,281 --> 01:51:29,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Next would be our parking.

1328
01:51:29,682 --> 01:51:44,657
[SPEAKER_07]: The parking here, the ratio of parking would be one parking space for every two units, which is a parking space ratio that the underlying zoning currently would permit at the site for affordable housing use development.

1329
01:51:48,609 --> 01:51:50,310
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, I think that's great.

1330
01:51:50,650 --> 01:52:00,653
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think with that, I guess the last thing to mention, maybe it's a less substantive provision, but is the PDD amendment allows for screening of mechanical equipment.

1331
01:52:01,233 --> 01:52:10,396
[SPEAKER_07]: And we always recognize that that is a concern to minimize the visibility of mechanical equipment on site and from the streets and from neighboring parcels.

1332
01:52:10,816 --> 01:52:17,218
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the requirements for the project under the PDD is to make sure there's adequate screening

1333
01:52:17,748 --> 01:52:18,949
[SPEAKER_07]: such mechanical equipment.

1334
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:20,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

1335
01:52:20,891 --> 01:52:25,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm here to answer any questions that you might have about the amendment, but this concludes my presentation.

1336
01:52:25,976 --> 01:52:26,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1337
01:52:26,337 --> 01:52:27,618
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Attorney Gilson.

1338
01:52:38,370 --> 01:52:40,291
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Garabello, do you have questions for you?

1339
01:52:40,371 --> 01:52:40,752
[SPEAKER_42]: Okay.

1340
01:52:41,912 --> 01:52:46,015
[SPEAKER_42]: So as this is a public hearing, we do have to open up the public hearing.

1341
01:52:46,035 --> 01:52:51,899
[SPEAKER_42]: So I'm going to open up, call for people who want to speak in favor of the position before us, the zoning change before us.

1342
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,862
[SPEAKER_42]: And then I will call for people who want to speak in opposition of the zoning change before us.

1343
01:52:57,663 --> 01:52:59,544
[SPEAKER_42]: lost my train of thought on something else.

1344
01:52:59,924 --> 01:53:01,204
[SPEAKER_27]: Should I start sharing now?

1345
01:53:01,244 --> 01:53:02,385
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, that would be helpful.

1346
01:53:03,125 --> 01:53:10,188
[SPEAKER_42]: Oh, what I wanted to say is also there's been a number of folks that also submitted their opinion by email that the clerk will add to the report as well.

1347
01:53:10,728 --> 01:53:21,131
[SPEAKER_42]: So as this is a public hearing, if there is anyone who would like to speak in favor of the paper before us, this is the zoning change before us that the MHA just presented on, please come up to the mic.

1348
01:53:21,812 --> 01:53:23,232
[SPEAKER_42]: You can literally just say yes.

1349
01:53:23,312 --> 01:53:24,373
[SPEAKER_42]: You can say a little bit more.

1350
01:53:27,730 --> 01:53:29,631
[SPEAKER_42]: Just name and address for the record, please, as you come up.

1351
01:53:30,591 --> 01:53:33,092
[SPEAKER_30]: Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

1352
01:53:33,993 --> 01:53:36,253
[SPEAKER_30]: And yes, I'm in favor of this development.

1353
01:53:36,954 --> 01:53:52,380
[SPEAKER_30]: And if I may say a little bit more, I am a member of the Community Preservation Committee, and we very strongly supported this development because we feel that it is really critical for improving the quality of life for the public housing residents at Walkling Court.

1354
01:53:52,480 --> 01:53:57,462
[SPEAKER_30]: And we think that the process that was required for the public input

1355
01:53:58,720 --> 01:54:04,284
[SPEAKER_30]: during the conceptual planning stage has really helped to create a project that fits well in the neighborhood.

1356
01:54:04,964 --> 01:54:14,009
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think that this zoning is a very appropriate way of being able to bring that plan to fruition.

1357
01:54:14,429 --> 01:54:14,970
[SPEAKER_30]: So thank you.

1358
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:15,690
[SPEAKER_30]: Thank you.

1359
01:54:19,418 --> 01:54:20,098
[SPEAKER_42]: New address for the record, please.

1360
01:54:20,658 --> 01:54:24,039
[SPEAKER_23]: William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1361
01:54:25,319 --> 01:54:29,320
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm here to ask that you do approve this zoning amendment.

1362
01:54:30,320 --> 01:54:35,861
[SPEAKER_23]: The Medford Housing Authority has got grant money available to build more and better, deeply affordable housing at Walkley Court.

1363
01:54:36,841 --> 01:54:39,962
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody supports affordable housing.

1364
01:54:41,522 --> 01:54:48,103
[SPEAKER_23]: Council needs to say yes to this zoning amendment so the housing gets built so that MHA can access that money.

1365
01:54:48,590 --> 01:54:50,470
[SPEAKER_23]: and build the housing that our community needs.

1366
01:54:50,691 --> 01:54:51,011
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1367
01:54:51,691 --> 01:54:51,971
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1368
01:54:51,991 --> 01:54:56,112
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm gonna go to Kate on Zoom, and then I'll come back to you.

1369
01:54:56,172 --> 01:54:57,292
[SPEAKER_42]: Kate, I will unmute you.

1370
01:55:01,853 --> 01:55:03,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And then just keep going.

1371
01:55:03,934 --> 01:55:04,894
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we can hear you.

1372
01:55:05,434 --> 01:55:07,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Canal Street, number nine, Medford.

1373
01:55:08,635 --> 01:55:15,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a public housing resident with physical and other disabilities, and I am very strongly in favor of this.

1374
01:55:16,317 --> 01:55:18,057
[SPEAKER_03]: It is desperately needed.

1375
01:55:19,969 --> 01:55:28,932
[SPEAKER_03]: One out of every 10 COVID cases, for example, will lead to long COVID, which means that more people are going to be disabled than ever in the coming years.

1376
01:55:29,653 --> 01:55:31,793
[SPEAKER_03]: People really, really need this.

1377
01:55:32,433 --> 01:55:35,615
[SPEAKER_03]: We deserve to live in as nice housing as anybody else.

1378
01:55:36,315 --> 01:55:36,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1379
01:55:44,724 --> 01:55:46,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Mark Curtis, 89 Traincroft Street in Medford.

1380
01:55:47,646 --> 01:55:48,667
[SPEAKER_06]: It's good evening.

1381
01:55:50,948 --> 01:55:58,193
[SPEAKER_06]: This proposed zoning change makes possible a deeply needed and truly transformative redevelopment projects.

1382
01:56:00,374 --> 01:56:06,798
[SPEAKER_06]: We all know that Waukling Court is outdated, in truly bad condition.

1383
01:56:08,759 --> 01:56:12,562
[SPEAKER_06]: And what the Medford Housing Authority, our Medford Housing Authority is proposing here,

1384
01:56:13,818 --> 01:56:25,967
[SPEAKER_06]: is an attractive, multi-generational community that will provide brand new apartments for existing residents, as well as new, deeply affordable housing for families.

1385
01:56:28,249 --> 01:56:38,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this project provides more new, deeply affordable housing at one time because of this zoning change than we have seen in Medford in many years.

1386
01:56:41,038 --> 01:56:45,059
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to commend the Housing Authority for the process that they've gone through.

1387
01:56:45,079 --> 01:56:49,840
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this is a very well-designed and thoughtful project.

1388
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:57,641
[SPEAKER_06]: It's bringing an impressive amount of federal and state funds to complement the city funds that are going into the projects.

1389
01:56:59,401 --> 01:57:01,082
[SPEAKER_06]: And I strongly encourage you to support it.

1390
01:57:01,262 --> 01:57:01,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1391
01:57:02,142 --> 01:57:02,462
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1392
01:57:03,222 --> 01:57:05,022
[SPEAKER_42]: We'll go to Alex on Zoom.

1393
01:57:05,382 --> 01:57:06,663
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address for the record, please.

1394
01:57:08,123 --> 01:57:08,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1395
01:57:09,983 --> 01:57:12,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Alex Lessenhop, 30 Wright Avenue in Medford.

1396
01:57:14,564 --> 01:57:20,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would just like to co-sign everything everyone has said before me and add that I'm strongly in favor of this project.

1397
01:57:21,025 --> 01:57:31,287
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a kind of opportunity we never get in Medford to develop this type of deeply affordable housing, this type of accessible housing, this type of housing for families.

1398
01:57:31,467 --> 01:57:34,147
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just such a rare opportunity and we can't waste it.

1399
01:57:34,407 --> 01:57:37,688
[SPEAKER_04]: And our public housing residents deserve dignity, they deserve

1400
01:57:38,138 --> 01:57:42,520
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, stable, accessible, attractive housing, just like any of us.

1401
01:57:42,840 --> 01:57:46,642
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, I would urge the council to vote in favor.

1402
01:57:47,022 --> 01:57:47,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1403
01:57:48,363 --> 01:57:48,603
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1404
01:57:48,623 --> 01:57:53,545
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of this paper, either in person or on Zoom?

1405
01:57:59,528 --> 01:58:03,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Roseberry portrait of 78 Orchard Street in Medford,

1406
01:58:03,477 --> 01:58:06,719
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't live that far from the development.

1407
01:58:07,059 --> 01:58:17,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been involved with the development for many years, starting as a teenager and now into my adulthood, I do a lot of things for a lot of the residents there.

1408
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:29,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I know there is opposition, but to me, if we can put more people that don't have adequate housing,

1409
01:58:30,733 --> 01:58:38,578
[SPEAKER_02]: into an adequate housing that has an elevator, which none of the buildings in Rockland Court right now have.

1410
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:50,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of those residents now that live there, I know personally, are at a big disadvantage because they can't walk up the stairs.

1411
01:58:50,887 --> 01:58:53,128
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't even walk over to Whole Foods.

1412
01:58:53,789 --> 01:58:58,332
[SPEAKER_02]: They depend on people to come in and help them as much as possible.

1413
01:58:59,035 --> 01:58:59,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm one of them.

1414
01:59:00,055 --> 01:59:07,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I have some of the residents that call me saying I need groceries and I'll definitely go over and I'll do it for them.

1415
01:59:09,399 --> 01:59:13,020
[SPEAKER_02]: I've watched people come and go out of that development.

1416
01:59:13,320 --> 01:59:18,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I've watched it grow and now it's falling apart.

1417
01:59:19,402 --> 01:59:27,805
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really definitely need this building to be able to live freely and hopefully

1418
01:59:28,649 --> 01:59:33,751
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to get out again and do what they need to do.

1419
01:59:35,611 --> 01:59:38,973
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sad that they have to stay in their houses.

1420
01:59:39,673 --> 01:59:41,353
[SPEAKER_02]: That causes more depression.

1421
01:59:41,774 --> 01:59:44,434
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's a health issue.

1422
01:59:45,275 --> 01:59:55,038
[SPEAKER_02]: And that costs us as taxpayers more money because we have to pay for those disabilities to get readjusted.

1423
01:59:55,658 --> 01:59:57,379
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not fair to them.

1424
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:05,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, there were a couple of residents here that needed to go home that wanted to speak, and that's basically what they were going to say.

1425
02:00:05,745 --> 02:00:10,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just here to relay their message as well as mine.

1426
02:00:11,028 --> 02:00:20,834
[SPEAKER_02]: I've watched a lot of people come and go, and it's sad, but we really need to let these people have a good life.

1427
02:00:21,534 --> 02:00:25,797
[SPEAKER_02]: We, as individuals, have a good life in our homes or

1428
02:00:26,590 --> 02:00:30,614
[SPEAKER_02]: in our neighborhoods, and we've watched developments go up and down.

1429
02:00:31,274 --> 02:00:40,823
[SPEAKER_02]: But this would give many, many people an enjoyable place to live and let them enjoy their freedom again.

1430
02:00:41,524 --> 02:00:41,984
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1431
02:00:42,004 --> 02:00:44,006
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1432
02:00:44,026 --> 02:00:46,168
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm going to go to Susan on Zoom.

1433
02:00:48,410 --> 02:00:50,012
[SPEAKER_42]: Susan, name and address for the record, please.

1434
02:00:52,040 --> 02:00:53,461
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Susan Gerard.

1435
02:00:54,601 --> 02:00:57,162
[SPEAKER_10]: I live at 26 Farragut Ave, Medford.

1436
02:00:57,462 --> 02:00:58,542
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't live near Walkling.

1437
02:00:59,663 --> 02:01:10,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Many years ago, I tutored a Russian immigrant who had pancreatic cancer, who lived in Walkling Court, and she could not handle the stairs.

1438
02:01:10,626 --> 02:01:12,367
[SPEAKER_10]: She had to move out.

1439
02:01:13,407 --> 02:01:14,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Luckily, she was able to find

1440
02:01:16,563 --> 02:01:24,108
[SPEAKER_10]: another senior housing unit to live in that had elevators, but others were not so lucky, I think.

1441
02:01:25,149 --> 02:01:40,020
[SPEAKER_10]: I also just want to say I've had many friends in Medford who are seniors who needed this kind of affordable housing, but the lists are, I think, two or three years long waiting lists

1442
02:01:40,940 --> 02:01:55,748
[SPEAKER_10]: And this, I've lived in Medford for 42 years and I've never seen a truly affordable housing project like Walkling Court in the 42 years really being built.

1443
02:01:56,108 --> 02:01:59,049
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this is just an amazing opportunity.

1444
02:01:59,570 --> 02:02:09,775
[SPEAKER_10]: I know there is some criticisms and there always will be of anything that gets built, but to me, this is a beautiful chance for people to have decent homes to live in.

1445
02:02:09,875 --> 02:02:10,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1446
02:02:11,695 --> 02:02:11,995
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1447
02:02:12,015 --> 02:02:16,296
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone else, either on Zoom or in person, who would like to speak in favor?

1448
02:02:20,837 --> 02:02:23,637
[SPEAKER_42]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

1449
02:02:23,657 --> 02:02:25,457
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition?

1450
02:02:25,477 --> 02:02:27,198
[SPEAKER_42]: Please come up to the mic or raise your hand on Zoom.

1451
02:02:28,878 --> 02:02:30,998
[SPEAKER_42]: I'd like to speak in opposition of the zoning change.

1452
02:02:33,319 --> 02:02:35,859
[SPEAKER_42]: Opposed to the change.

1453
02:02:35,939 --> 02:02:36,620
[SPEAKER_42]: Whenever you're ready.

1454
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:39,200
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, you can just get in line when you're ready.

1455
02:02:41,078 --> 02:02:41,979
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address, please.

1456
02:02:42,019 --> 02:02:42,439
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi.

1457
02:02:43,240 --> 02:02:46,502
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Peggy Zisk, and I live in Tadnisher Road.

1458
02:02:48,164 --> 02:03:02,615
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm not really against, but I do want to point out a couple of details that the Auckland Court is a little dense.

1459
02:03:02,755 --> 02:03:08,279
[SPEAKER_13]: I went into the planning commission and looked at the plans, because people

1460
02:03:09,927 --> 02:03:14,549
[SPEAKER_13]: said that it's the same height as the building on the north side, which is the commercial buildings.

1461
02:03:15,389 --> 02:03:18,410
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you go and look at those buildings, there are four stories.

1462
02:03:19,210 --> 02:03:30,254
[SPEAKER_13]: These are six, which means that the units inside will only be seven-foot ceilings after you take out for the plumbing and the false ceilings.

1463
02:03:31,154 --> 02:03:34,155
[SPEAKER_13]: If anyone has ever lived in public housing,

1464
02:03:35,187 --> 02:03:41,475
[SPEAKER_13]: or worked in public housing, that's really uncomfortable living.

1465
02:03:41,936 --> 02:03:43,277
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a little bit depressing.

1466
02:03:44,279 --> 02:03:52,449
[SPEAKER_13]: The buildings that they have proposed for the elderly is pretty long hallways and very short ceilings.

1467
02:03:53,332 --> 02:04:05,116
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you've ever lived in an elderly housing building or visited anyone, your grandparents, your parents, they're not very exciting places because they don't have a lot of energy.

1468
02:04:06,517 --> 02:04:16,961
[SPEAKER_13]: So isolating people in a community and doubling the density is going to bring down the level quality of life.

1469
02:04:17,373 --> 02:04:17,834
[SPEAKER_13]: for people.

1470
02:04:18,234 --> 02:04:19,515
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to have air conditioning.

1471
02:04:19,535 --> 02:04:20,756
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to love that.

1472
02:04:20,837 --> 02:04:22,899
[SPEAKER_13]: I've already talked to some people in that building.

1473
02:04:22,939 --> 02:04:24,140
[SPEAKER_13]: They think it's great.

1474
02:04:24,160 --> 02:04:25,862
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to have better heating.

1475
02:04:26,082 --> 02:04:27,303
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to have elevators.

1476
02:04:28,504 --> 02:04:28,845
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

1477
02:04:29,585 --> 02:04:32,568
[SPEAKER_13]: They're also going to have twice as many people.

1478
02:04:33,329 --> 02:04:39,576
[SPEAKER_13]: If you look at any housing project from Chicago to Somerville, they don't work.

1479
02:04:41,304 --> 02:04:48,606
[SPEAKER_13]: They become, eventually, over the years, people get stuck for generations in low-income housing.

1480
02:04:49,627 --> 02:04:55,569
[SPEAKER_13]: People who can move out do move out, and people who can't stay, and the quality of life is lower.

1481
02:04:56,049 --> 02:05:00,730
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's great, we should build elderly housing, for sure.

1482
02:05:02,071 --> 02:05:07,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Should you pack the density in twice the number of people into those buildings?

1483
02:05:08,553 --> 02:05:08,673
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

1484
02:05:09,503 --> 02:05:17,328
[SPEAKER_13]: So you shouldn't, it's fine to rezone it if you want to rezone it, but as you said before, I don't think there's really a plan.

1485
02:05:17,829 --> 02:05:20,571
[SPEAKER_13]: This is more a response to an opportunity.

1486
02:05:21,711 --> 02:05:23,473
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure Menford has a plan.

1487
02:05:24,713 --> 02:05:38,483
[SPEAKER_13]: We have squandered quite a few opportunities down by the river where there was lots of opportunity for housing and to incorporate low income housing with middle income and high income housing, and it's gone.

1488
02:05:39,045 --> 02:05:42,686
[SPEAKER_13]: The buildings are beautiful, but wealthy people live there.

1489
02:05:44,026 --> 02:06:00,409
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I discourage you from rezoning a parcel just to fix a project and squeeze as many low-income people as possible into a very concentrated neighborhood.

1490
02:06:03,030 --> 02:06:06,331
[SPEAKER_13]: And currently, the plan that they have is turning

1491
02:06:08,252 --> 02:06:17,836
[SPEAKER_13]: kind of a nice green space if you walk around in there to purely concrete streets with lots of parking and very little green.

1492
02:06:18,296 --> 02:06:23,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Even though they said 10%, it's very unattractive plans.

1493
02:06:24,058 --> 02:06:26,099
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know if anyone's looked at the plans.

1494
02:06:27,199 --> 02:06:28,600
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you for your time.

1495
02:06:29,160 --> 02:06:29,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1496
02:06:30,780 --> 02:06:33,682
[SPEAKER_42]: And I'm gonna go to, I know we had someone here.

1497
02:06:33,702 --> 02:06:37,203
[SPEAKER_42]: If you wanna come and then I'll go to Diane on Zoom and we'll go in person first.

1498
02:06:40,464 --> 02:06:41,605
[SPEAKER_42]: name and address for the record, please.

1499
02:06:43,366 --> 02:06:45,447
[SPEAKER_48]: Angela Murphy, 16 Codding Street.

1500
02:06:45,887 --> 02:06:48,088
[SPEAKER_48]: I've been on Codding Street 67 years.

1501
02:06:48,628 --> 02:06:54,111
[SPEAKER_48]: I've been there when Walking Court was built as a beautiful suburban senior community.

1502
02:06:55,012 --> 02:07:01,395
[SPEAKER_48]: As the previous speaker said, I want to recommend

1503
02:07:02,022 --> 02:07:10,085
[SPEAKER_48]: that this zoning be disapproved, the change, because of all the reasons she stated, which I have written down, the same reasons.

1504
02:07:11,466 --> 02:07:19,449
[SPEAKER_48]: The quality of life for the residents that the buildings for the seniors is proposed for, I don't believe will be enhanced.

1505
02:07:19,969 --> 02:07:23,371
[SPEAKER_48]: They're going to be abutting a railroad commuter train track.

1506
02:07:24,159 --> 02:07:42,368
[SPEAKER_48]: The back apartments will face, if you're housebound, look out your window and all you will see is train tracks and a building overshadowing yours, which will cause sunlight to be limited because it's going to be higher elevation than your six-story building.

1507
02:07:43,148 --> 02:07:46,129
[SPEAKER_48]: You're condensing, again, too many people into the site.

1508
02:07:47,290 --> 02:07:50,872
[SPEAKER_48]: You're eliminating a lot of green space that was there.

1509
02:07:51,925 --> 02:08:03,553
[SPEAKER_48]: I think, while yes, there is a definite need for low-income housing, senior housing, disabled housing, I as a 72-year-old senior would not want to live there.

1510
02:08:04,434 --> 02:08:09,137
[SPEAKER_48]: I would not want my autistic grandson to move into a disabled housing

1511
02:08:10,056 --> 02:08:11,397
[SPEAKER_48]: there in this proposal.

1512
02:08:11,937 --> 02:08:17,281
[SPEAKER_48]: I would not want my disabled sister, who's in a wheelchair, to live in this complex.

1513
02:08:17,741 --> 02:08:23,205
[SPEAKER_48]: I am not against building a senior housing project, not a project, a community.

1514
02:08:23,325 --> 02:08:26,127
[SPEAKER_48]: I call it a community because this, to me, is a project.

1515
02:08:26,767 --> 02:08:27,788
[SPEAKER_48]: It's not a community.

1516
02:08:29,649 --> 02:08:33,152
[SPEAKER_48]: I would not oppose building something there, scaling down

1517
02:08:34,238 --> 02:08:51,092
[SPEAKER_48]: the six-story buildings, reconfigurating the design so that the buildings are not horizontal along the track, but perpendicular, so that the stairwells, windows will face the unsightly view, have more green space.

1518
02:08:51,132 --> 02:08:55,835
[SPEAKER_48]: The community gardens, they want to relocate to

1519
02:08:57,042 --> 02:09:00,485
[SPEAKER_48]: an area of the complex that is not fit for growing things.

1520
02:09:01,346 --> 02:09:02,207
[SPEAKER_48]: So nothing's going to grow.

1521
02:09:02,227 --> 02:09:03,909
[SPEAKER_48]: They're going to take down mature trees.

1522
02:09:04,750 --> 02:09:09,034
[SPEAKER_48]: And as she said, our previous speaker, the green space is going to be limited.

1523
02:09:09,955 --> 02:09:11,857
[SPEAKER_48]: It's not going to be a community.

1524
02:09:12,037 --> 02:09:13,558
[SPEAKER_48]: It's going to be a project.

1525
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:19,685
[SPEAKER_48]: And our quality of life for those residents they proposed for will not be enhanced.

1526
02:09:20,970 --> 02:09:23,351
[SPEAKER_48]: And yes, I think Meffitt should build something there.

1527
02:09:24,072 --> 02:09:26,313
[SPEAKER_48]: Yes, I loved Walkland Court when it was built.

1528
02:09:26,453 --> 02:09:30,376
[SPEAKER_48]: I still love going there and seeing it and walking through it.

1529
02:09:31,556 --> 02:09:39,681
[SPEAKER_48]: And I one day thought when my house passed on to my children, I may live in Walkland Court, but now I would not if this proposal goes through.

1530
02:09:40,141 --> 02:09:44,043
[SPEAKER_48]: Let's find a plan that Meffitt can build on that site.

1531
02:09:44,564 --> 02:09:46,485
[SPEAKER_48]: And I challenge every councilor here

1532
02:09:46,945 --> 02:10:01,911
[SPEAKER_48]: to come down to that site and look at that site and see what they're proposing and see how congested it's going to be and see what's going to do to surrounding neighbors and the community that it's going to be integrated into and everything.

1533
02:10:02,011 --> 02:10:05,273
[SPEAKER_48]: Parking's going to overflow onto streets which is already crowded.

1534
02:10:06,805 --> 02:10:16,570
[SPEAKER_48]: and residents coming and going, visitors, health aides, Meals on Wheels people, deliveries, it's gonna be nonstop.

1535
02:10:16,610 --> 02:10:17,711
[SPEAKER_48]: We have one-way streets.

1536
02:10:18,091 --> 02:10:21,193
[SPEAKER_48]: We have bad traffic from Route 16 already.

1537
02:10:21,753 --> 02:10:30,178
[SPEAKER_48]: Cars speed down past the park on linemen and clotting because they're going the wrong way, and they wanna hit Winter Street before they hit another car coming down.

1538
02:10:30,818 --> 02:10:34,040
[SPEAKER_48]: I can't tell you how many times I almost got hit coming out of my own driveway.

1539
02:10:35,376 --> 02:10:37,737
[SPEAKER_48]: So 67 years I've lived in that community.

1540
02:10:38,137 --> 02:10:42,979
[SPEAKER_48]: This, I think, would be a shame to build this particular proposal.

1541
02:10:43,479 --> 02:10:45,460
[SPEAKER_48]: I think rethink other proposals.

1542
02:10:47,141 --> 02:10:53,703
[SPEAKER_48]: Another thing I want to say is all the public meetings, all the notices, I live on Carding Street.

1543
02:10:53,783 --> 02:11:00,406
[SPEAKER_48]: I don't live within the 400 radius they're obligated to inform, but I never, never once informed.

1544
02:11:01,126 --> 02:11:02,566
[SPEAKER_48]: of anything going on there.

1545
02:11:03,327 --> 02:11:05,607
[SPEAKER_48]: If it wasn't for a neighbor of mine, I would not know.

1546
02:11:05,947 --> 02:11:08,868
[SPEAKER_48]: And at one public meeting, I went to Walkland Court.

1547
02:11:09,288 --> 02:11:22,992
[SPEAKER_48]: I was verbally berated by the complex manager while the housing authority person stood there and let her berate me, try to intimidate me, and stop me from asking questions.

1548
02:11:24,093 --> 02:11:28,554
[SPEAKER_48]: As you can see, I'm nervous now talking here, but I'm not a dumb old woman.

1549
02:11:29,845 --> 02:11:36,027
[SPEAKER_48]: I know what fits there and I think everybody should go down there and double check what they want to do to this community.

1550
02:11:36,768 --> 02:11:37,968
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you for listening to me.

1551
02:11:38,448 --> 02:11:38,748
[SPEAKER_48]: Thank you.

1552
02:11:38,769 --> 02:11:44,331
[SPEAKER_42]: We're going to go to Diane on zoom and then we'll come back person.

1553
02:11:45,351 --> 02:11:48,612
[SPEAKER_42]: Uh, Diane, name and address for the record, please.

1554
02:11:49,093 --> 02:11:51,553
[SPEAKER_45]: Hi, Diane McKinney, 29 North street.

1555
02:11:51,754 --> 02:11:55,235
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm a co-owner of the home directly abutting

1556
02:11:56,083 --> 02:11:56,824
[SPEAKER_45]: the proposal.

1557
02:11:57,484 --> 02:12:09,012
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm with everybody that, you know, Medford needs to have affordable housing for disabled, for the elderly, and I'm not against that in any way, shape or form.

1558
02:12:09,252 --> 02:12:14,155
[SPEAKER_45]: I'm strictly against the size and the scope of this project.

1559
02:12:14,655 --> 02:12:19,679
[SPEAKER_45]: You've got a huge six-story building going in the middle

1560
02:12:21,005 --> 02:12:25,394
[SPEAKER_45]: of a neighborhood of single, double floor homes.

1561
02:12:27,386 --> 02:12:29,867
[SPEAKER_45]: there's going to be immense traffic impact.

1562
02:12:30,467 --> 02:12:44,371
[SPEAKER_45]: They do have a traffic study on the plans that was done that took in account, I believe, the COVID impact, but I don't recall seeing any impact related to the new T station down the street.

1563
02:12:45,311 --> 02:12:52,613
[SPEAKER_45]: With the top station, there's also some words about having them extend that green line down towards

1564
02:12:53,814 --> 02:12:58,517
[SPEAKER_45]: I don't know the name of the road down there, but past where the U-Haul place was around that area.

1565
02:12:59,337 --> 02:13:06,282
[SPEAKER_45]: And I just think that this project, the size and the scope is just going to overwhelm that neighborhood.

1566
02:13:06,662 --> 02:13:17,470
[SPEAKER_45]: And I agree with the woman before who said, you know, people need to go down and actually look at that area and see what a six, two six story buildings are going to do to that neighborhood.

1567
02:13:18,496 --> 02:13:33,385
[SPEAKER_45]: Also, there's a thousand plus petition of neighbors and community residents who have signed a petition against this proposal, basically for those reasons.

1568
02:13:34,246 --> 02:13:38,568
[SPEAKER_45]: And we never hear talk about that during these calls and these proposals.

1569
02:13:39,469 --> 02:13:45,472
[SPEAKER_45]: And it just needs to be brought to the attention of the council that there is opposition not

1570
02:13:47,298 --> 02:13:53,100
[SPEAKER_45]: not as a NIMBY type of atmosphere, but simply because of the size and the scope of this project.

1571
02:13:53,820 --> 02:13:54,160
[SPEAKER_45]: Thank you.

1572
02:13:54,180 --> 02:13:56,181
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1573
02:14:05,464 --> 02:14:06,304
[SPEAKER_42]: Hi.

1574
02:14:06,344 --> 02:14:07,124
[SPEAKER_42]: You can bend it down.

1575
02:14:07,144 --> 02:14:07,484
[SPEAKER_42]: There you go.

1576
02:14:07,744 --> 02:14:07,945
[SPEAKER_47]: Hi.

1577
02:14:08,005 --> 02:14:11,326
[SPEAKER_47]: Mary Anna Ducey, 2 North Street, Metro.

1578
02:14:12,386 --> 02:14:13,066
[SPEAKER_47]: A couple of things.

1579
02:14:13,126 --> 02:14:15,607
[SPEAKER_47]: I want to talk about first the process here.

1580
02:14:16,851 --> 02:14:17,992
[SPEAKER_47]: for this meeting tonight.

1581
02:14:18,352 --> 02:14:22,033
[SPEAKER_47]: There was a September 14th public meeting notice in the newspaper.

1582
02:14:22,593 --> 02:14:29,836
[SPEAKER_47]: It was a combined notice about both the October 4th community development meeting and this meeting tonight.

1583
02:14:31,076 --> 02:14:36,158
[SPEAKER_47]: And so that was really two months before tonight's meeting.

1584
02:14:36,538 --> 02:14:43,441
[SPEAKER_47]: In past public meeting notices that were in the newspaper, the meeting usually followed within two or three weeks after the notice.

1585
02:14:43,902 --> 02:14:46,723
[SPEAKER_47]: that this meeting tonight is two months after the notice.

1586
02:14:47,363 --> 02:14:51,504
[SPEAKER_47]: Now, I don't know if that's two months is too long a period.

1587
02:14:54,544 --> 02:14:57,605
[SPEAKER_47]: Is it legal to have a long period like that?

1588
02:14:58,745 --> 02:15:06,547
[SPEAKER_47]: And if so, does this process need to be repeated because of the notification period was too long?

1589
02:15:06,707 --> 02:15:07,287
[SPEAKER_47]: It is legal.

1590
02:15:07,307 --> 02:15:07,547
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay.

1591
02:15:11,641 --> 02:15:28,528
[SPEAKER_47]: The second thing is that the text of this notice said that for this Community Development Board meeting, questions and comments can be submitted via email to the Community Development Office or by phone to their number.

1592
02:15:29,588 --> 02:15:34,890
[SPEAKER_47]: So I went to the Community Development Office and asked if I could see these public comments, which I did.

1593
02:15:36,291 --> 02:15:41,193
[SPEAKER_47]: And they gave me copies of both the postal and the email comments, but they said they were not

1594
02:15:41,702 --> 02:15:43,763
[SPEAKER_47]: counting the phone comments.

1595
02:15:44,584 --> 02:15:46,565
[SPEAKER_47]: Apparently some phone comments came in.

1596
02:15:51,468 --> 02:15:55,651
[SPEAKER_47]: Even though the newspaper said that they could accept phones, but they weren't gonna accept the phone.

1597
02:15:55,691 --> 02:15:57,953
[SPEAKER_47]: They took them in, but they weren't gonna count them.

1598
02:15:59,194 --> 02:16:08,980
[SPEAKER_47]: So they have recently started, the Community Development Office, referring people who call in comments to send in written comments instead.

1599
02:16:10,088 --> 02:16:30,352
[SPEAKER_47]: So therefore the question is, is the validity of this particular public hearing notice, and because of the fact that they weren't accepting, they had the phone there and they weren't accepting the phones, does that need to be repeated?

1600
02:16:30,952 --> 02:16:34,012
[SPEAKER_47]: Because they're not accepting all the comments they got.

1601
02:16:34,372 --> 02:16:36,073
[SPEAKER_47]: So I don't know, probably can't answer that.

1602
02:16:37,073 --> 02:16:38,293
[SPEAKER_47]: Probably requires a legal,

1603
02:16:39,512 --> 02:16:39,932
[SPEAKER_47]: decision.

1604
02:16:41,874 --> 02:16:42,194
[SPEAKER_47]: All right.

1605
02:16:42,414 --> 02:17:04,488
[SPEAKER_47]: Then, I don't have email myself, but someone saw a bunch of emails from a Medford Housing Advocacy Group who asked Councilor Collins when the vote on the Swarling Court zoning was going to happen, because they wanted to submit comments.

1606
02:17:05,249 --> 02:17:08,051
[SPEAKER_47]: And Councilor Collins told them about

1607
02:17:12,266 --> 02:17:16,107
[SPEAKER_47]: that the real vote of this zoning was gonna happen tonight.

1608
02:17:16,667 --> 02:17:20,648
[SPEAKER_47]: There was the October 4th meeting, but the real vote was gonna happen tonight.

1609
02:17:21,408 --> 02:17:37,692
[SPEAKER_47]: Then on a couple of days later, Director Hunt from the Community Development Office clarified this whole process with a more detailed explanation of Councilor Collins' explanation.

1610
02:17:38,398 --> 02:17:57,743
[SPEAKER_47]: and said that the matter, on the matter of the count, let me see, the chain process, and the comments on this matter count, the matter will count, it can influence the process really tonight, because tonight is really when the vote was gonna happen.

1611
02:17:58,423 --> 02:18:08,205
[SPEAKER_47]: And then later on that same day, our incoming city councilor emailed the same advocacy group

1612
02:18:08,770 --> 02:18:15,091
[SPEAKER_47]: and said, thanks to Director Hunt, because now we know when we should intervene.

1613
02:18:16,331 --> 02:18:38,055
[SPEAKER_47]: So, apparently, it appears to me that this advocacy group has got information that the general public doesn't know about, because all the general public saw, if you saw it, was the newspaper announcement that talked about the October 4th meeting and tonight's meeting, respond by email or respond by phone.

1614
02:18:39,115 --> 02:18:48,949
[SPEAKER_47]: So, therefore the general public hasn't got the same information that people on the advocacy group

1615
02:18:49,740 --> 02:18:51,001
[SPEAKER_47]: got from city officials.

1616
02:18:51,962 --> 02:18:54,343
[SPEAKER_47]: So I'm just bringing that to everybody's attention.

1617
02:18:55,044 --> 02:18:58,646
[SPEAKER_47]: So whether that matters here, I don't know.

1618
02:18:59,507 --> 02:19:03,850
[SPEAKER_47]: As far as the petition, I was the one that did the petition and went circulated.

1619
02:19:03,930 --> 02:19:10,375
[SPEAKER_47]: I got, as I told you before, you've all got copies, 1,131 signatures on the petition.

1620
02:19:13,117 --> 02:19:16,199
[SPEAKER_47]: The people who signed the petition are not opposed to

1621
02:19:16,962 --> 02:19:18,323
[SPEAKER_47]: developing Rockland Court.

1622
02:19:18,883 --> 02:19:23,485
[SPEAKER_47]: They're opposed to the design and the scale and the number of people that are gonna be there.

1623
02:19:24,686 --> 02:19:31,389
[SPEAKER_47]: The community wasn't, beyond the 400 feet, the community around Rockland Court was not notified about this.

1624
02:19:31,429 --> 02:19:34,130
[SPEAKER_47]: They were surprised when I came with the petition.

1625
02:19:34,450 --> 02:19:35,671
[SPEAKER_47]: They didn't know anything about this.

1626
02:19:36,391 --> 02:19:39,252
[SPEAKER_47]: So the community doesn't have information about this.

1627
02:19:42,730 --> 02:19:53,181
[SPEAKER_47]: The original architect that did the 1960s plan put the buildings along the track perpendicular to the track, not parallel with the track.

1628
02:19:53,641 --> 02:20:00,868
[SPEAKER_47]: Even though these are going to be modern buildings, nice buildings, and all that, half of the units are still going to face the railroad track.

1629
02:20:01,609 --> 02:20:14,520
[SPEAKER_47]: Now, if any of you have elderly grandparents or people that you know, people who don't go out very much that are housebound, it's very depressing when all they have to look out to is a train track and a train.

1630
02:20:15,001 --> 02:20:17,963
[SPEAKER_47]: I had an elderly grandmother who couldn't go out.

1631
02:20:18,464 --> 02:20:25,430
[SPEAKER_47]: She used to sit by the window and watch the people that went by just as an uplifting thing.

1632
02:20:25,970 --> 02:20:26,110
[SPEAKER_47]: So,

1633
02:20:27,455 --> 02:20:46,668
[SPEAKER_47]: even though it's a nice building, and they compare it to other buildings that have been built in Somerville and further on down the track, those buildings in Somerville are probably adults, working people, who go out every day, who only come home at night, so they don't have to worry about looking out the window, but seniors, this is their life, the ones that are housebound.

1634
02:20:47,528 --> 02:20:49,730
[SPEAKER_47]: Marion, I do wanna... Yeah, I'll wrap it up here.

1635
02:20:50,010 --> 02:20:51,090
[SPEAKER_47]: Yeah, thank you.

1636
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:53,152
[SPEAKER_47]: Okay, so in short,

1637
02:20:55,101 --> 02:20:59,745
[SPEAKER_47]: The 1,100 people that signed the petition are not opposed to this.

1638
02:21:00,105 --> 02:21:03,407
[SPEAKER_47]: They just want the design to be modified.

1639
02:21:04,088 --> 02:21:12,775
[SPEAKER_47]: It's too much in too small an area, and the community around there has not been consulted about what it's gonna do to us, or even considered.

1640
02:21:12,795 --> 02:21:14,696
[SPEAKER_47]: Thank you.

1641
02:21:14,916 --> 02:21:15,236
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1642
02:21:17,078 --> 02:21:19,260
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition?

1643
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:21,982
[SPEAKER_42]: You can just name and address the record, please.

1644
02:21:25,358 --> 02:21:27,198
[SPEAKER_00]: David Peters, 17 North Street.

1645
02:21:28,519 --> 02:21:32,860
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to reiterate that everything that they said, I agree with.

1646
02:21:33,280 --> 02:21:36,941
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here tonight to vote on the zoning, which is two major things.

1647
02:21:37,041 --> 02:21:38,741
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the density, and it is the height.

1648
02:21:38,921 --> 02:21:40,222
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a direct abutter.

1649
02:21:43,982 --> 02:21:50,604
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody, along with the over 1,100 people that signed the petition, like she said, wants

1650
02:21:51,230 --> 02:21:54,172
[SPEAKER_00]: the elderly and the disabled to have a nice place to live.

1651
02:21:54,292 --> 02:22:03,259
[SPEAKER_00]: And we agree that the site could be upgraded and needs to be.

1652
02:22:04,560 --> 02:22:07,883
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said, we're opposed to the density and the height.

1653
02:22:08,583 --> 02:22:12,707
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we can go into a lot of other issues, but I know we're voting on zoning tonight.

1654
02:22:13,287 --> 02:22:14,468
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is the main issue.

1655
02:22:14,588 --> 02:22:19,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, over 1,100 people that live directly in that community

1656
02:22:21,122 --> 02:22:24,904
[SPEAKER_00]: wants is opposed to that, the way it is designed.

1657
02:22:25,784 --> 02:22:31,707
[SPEAKER_00]: I would ask to go back and have them redesign this project.

1658
02:22:33,048 --> 02:22:33,448
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1659
02:22:37,550 --> 02:22:37,770
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1660
02:22:37,790 --> 02:22:43,653
[SPEAKER_42]: Give me an address for the record, please.

1661
02:22:43,753 --> 02:22:45,554
[SPEAKER_32]: Brian Murphy, 16 Carnet Street.

1662
02:22:46,194 --> 02:22:49,776
[SPEAKER_32]: I wasn't going to talk, but I've lived there my whole life, 47 years.

1663
02:22:52,132 --> 02:22:55,393
[SPEAKER_32]: I've seen the changes in Method, 47 years.

1664
02:22:57,554 --> 02:23:09,318
[SPEAKER_32]: Our area now has become basically congested with the changes on South Street, the changes on 16, the trucks going up and down George Street, Summer Street.

1665
02:23:09,338 --> 02:23:15,020
[SPEAKER_32]: I mean, you got tractor trailers on College Ave because of what they did at the circle up there.

1666
02:23:17,261 --> 02:23:19,722
[SPEAKER_32]: Basically, we're looking at changing

1667
02:23:21,225 --> 02:23:23,047
[SPEAKER_32]: the dynamics of that area.

1668
02:23:23,547 --> 02:23:28,992
[SPEAKER_32]: And as everybody stated here that's against it, is you guys have to go down there and look and see what the hell's there.

1669
02:23:30,293 --> 02:23:33,856
[SPEAKER_32]: And see how many people blow through those stop signs on Carter Street and West Street.

1670
02:23:34,617 --> 02:23:36,619
[SPEAKER_32]: See how many people don't stop at Auburn Street.

1671
02:23:37,480 --> 02:23:44,105
[SPEAKER_32]: If they're talking about adding one parking space for every two units, I think that's what they said, right?

1672
02:23:45,046 --> 02:23:45,567
[SPEAKER_32]: Is that what they said?

1673
02:23:49,403 --> 02:23:51,443
[SPEAKER_32]: was one parking space for every two units.

1674
02:23:52,104 --> 02:23:53,104
[SPEAKER_32]: Now, a little history on me.

1675
02:23:53,784 --> 02:23:54,924
[SPEAKER_32]: I worked in public housing.

1676
02:23:55,644 --> 02:23:58,285
[SPEAKER_32]: I've done maintenance in housings.

1677
02:23:59,445 --> 02:23:59,945
[SPEAKER_32]: It doesn't work.

1678
02:24:01,005 --> 02:24:02,966
[SPEAKER_32]: The parking situation's always a mess.

1679
02:24:03,926 --> 02:24:05,526
[SPEAKER_32]: The residents always are getting tickets.

1680
02:24:06,647 --> 02:24:07,407
[SPEAKER_32]: It's crazy.

1681
02:24:08,247 --> 02:24:09,147
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm out of it now.

1682
02:24:09,707 --> 02:24:13,048
[SPEAKER_32]: But again, the zoning, we're sticking to the zoning right now.

1683
02:24:13,728 --> 02:24:15,988
[SPEAKER_32]: Changing it again to six stories is totally wrong.

1684
02:24:16,909 --> 02:24:18,289
[SPEAKER_32]: So I just wanted to say that.

1685
02:24:19,522 --> 02:24:19,782
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1686
02:24:19,862 --> 02:24:24,385
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition?

1687
02:24:32,011 --> 02:24:33,572
[SPEAKER_12]: Raymond Petra, 31, Burgadette.

1688
02:24:34,292 --> 02:24:36,794
[SPEAKER_12]: I've lived there for the past 40 years.

1689
02:24:36,894 --> 02:24:40,957
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard about this because Mary came to me for a cigarette, talking to me about this issue.

1690
02:24:42,098 --> 02:24:43,559
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with everybody that is said.

1691
02:24:44,059 --> 02:24:48,062
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the biggest issues I'm thinking the city is going to have is going to be the traffic.

1692
02:24:48,813 --> 02:25:00,319
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't know who did the survey, but let me tell you if you ever drive down Boston have at 330 in the afternoon You're taking 15 minutes to go to link the Boston out They said the traffic is going to be a nightmare.

1693
02:25:00,359 --> 02:25:07,183
[SPEAKER_12]: They're saying it's not you're talking if you put a hundred units in there You're probably gonna have a hundred cars, and where are they gonna go?

1694
02:25:07,443 --> 02:25:15,527
[SPEAKER_12]: There's gonna be a big issue plus the height of the building like people are saying It's gonna block views for other people the way they laid it out.

1695
02:25:15,587 --> 02:25:16,988
[SPEAKER_12]: I think is way too congested

1696
02:25:17,558 --> 02:25:21,982
[SPEAKER_12]: They need to go back and redesign, look at the area, and figure out what needs to do.

1697
02:25:22,563 --> 02:25:25,425
[SPEAKER_12]: If they have to, as well, improve the other units.

1698
02:25:25,866 --> 02:25:27,908
[SPEAKER_12]: They're talking about the other units are all run down.

1699
02:25:28,528 --> 02:25:29,289
[SPEAKER_12]: Whose fault is that?

1700
02:25:29,329 --> 02:25:30,350
[SPEAKER_12]: They need to be redone.

1701
02:25:31,331 --> 02:25:32,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Move the people somewhere else.

1702
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:35,010
[SPEAKER_12]: right here in Memphis Square.

1703
02:25:35,130 --> 02:25:36,171
[SPEAKER_12]: They're redoing the buildings.

1704
02:25:36,531 --> 02:25:41,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Why can't they redo the ones that are existing now to make it more convenient for the people that live there?

1705
02:25:41,993 --> 02:25:45,094
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's an issue, because there's an issue with the housing.

1706
02:25:45,114 --> 02:25:46,874
[SPEAKER_12]: That's where they need to start.

1707
02:25:47,375 --> 02:25:51,136
[SPEAKER_12]: Get that fixed, redesign the whole area, and get the traffic situation.

1708
02:25:51,696 --> 02:25:56,898
[SPEAKER_12]: I think traffic is going to become a total disaster once they build them this way.

1709
02:25:57,358 --> 02:25:58,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

1710
02:25:58,458 --> 02:25:58,719
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1711
02:25:58,739 --> 02:26:02,960
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone else who would like to come up to the mic, please?

1712
02:26:09,108 --> 02:26:10,268
[SPEAKER_42]: Name and address for the record, please.

1713
02:26:12,129 --> 02:26:13,989
[SPEAKER_46]: Andrew Goloso, 3 Northern Ave.

1714
02:26:16,970 --> 02:26:22,872
[SPEAKER_46]: Let's come back to the councilor Scarpelli's question.

1715
02:26:23,212 --> 02:26:24,213
[SPEAKER_46]: What is the vision for this?

1716
02:26:25,913 --> 02:26:26,553
[SPEAKER_46]: And what do we see?

1717
02:26:28,074 --> 02:26:38,457
[SPEAKER_46]: We see this six-story building for elderly and disabled who would see from the windows, the rail tracks, listen to the noise,

1718
02:26:39,118 --> 02:26:45,760
[SPEAKER_46]: And this green line extension, the railroad tracks even get closer.

1719
02:26:47,700 --> 02:27:00,203
[SPEAKER_46]: And these are the people who gave their best lives to the country, some of them disabled, some of them probably veterans who sacrificed their life, who risked their lives for us.

1720
02:27:02,744 --> 02:27:07,645
[SPEAKER_46]: And on the other hand, we have this family housing.

1721
02:27:08,568 --> 02:27:15,950
[SPEAKER_46]: for families without disabilities in townhouses, shoot it from the noise, just behind them.

1722
02:27:18,030 --> 02:27:18,911
[SPEAKER_46]: Does it make any sense?

1723
02:27:22,992 --> 02:27:27,633
[SPEAKER_46]: So I would reconsider the plan, how it was done, and consider what its vision would be.

1724
02:27:28,853 --> 02:27:36,115
[SPEAKER_46]: The affordable housing is important, considering that the inflation and the rise in rents

1725
02:27:37,194 --> 02:27:38,675
[SPEAKER_46]: So definitely, it's essential.

1726
02:27:39,935 --> 02:27:43,557
[SPEAKER_46]: But it's important to have affordable housing with dignity.

1727
02:27:45,358 --> 02:27:52,841
[SPEAKER_46]: It's important to have housing to make sure that our elderly are protected.

1728
02:27:53,801 --> 02:28:05,707
[SPEAKER_46]: Who would put their mothers, grandmothers, or grandparents, or anyone with disability to live against the rail tracks?

1729
02:28:06,770 --> 02:28:08,151
[SPEAKER_46]: And this is the housing for them.

1730
02:28:08,171 --> 02:28:12,073
[SPEAKER_46]: Most of the time, it's for permanent.

1731
02:28:13,374 --> 02:28:15,375
[SPEAKER_46]: It's gonna be until the end of their life.

1732
02:28:17,536 --> 02:28:21,758
[SPEAKER_46]: And this is, I'm sure we could do better than this.

1733
02:28:23,259 --> 02:28:28,062
[SPEAKER_46]: And regarding the meetings, you're talking about engaging.

1734
02:28:29,042 --> 02:28:32,904
[SPEAKER_46]: Well, the engaging word means you work both ways.

1735
02:28:34,125 --> 02:28:35,606
[SPEAKER_46]: I didn't feel we had engagements.

1736
02:28:37,415 --> 02:28:38,876
[SPEAKER_46]: I think we had more serving.

1737
02:28:39,997 --> 02:28:57,751
[SPEAKER_46]: We have been served with what they want, and each time we raise the issues, and pretty much most of them have been ignored, have been considered, have been documented, but ignored.

1738
02:28:58,551 --> 02:28:59,672
[SPEAKER_46]: This is not engagement.

1739
02:29:02,334 --> 02:29:06,598
[SPEAKER_46]: So for the vision, it's important to consider

1740
02:29:08,853 --> 02:29:10,014
[SPEAKER_46]: what needs to be done here.

1741
02:29:11,774 --> 02:29:24,421
[SPEAKER_46]: And I would request the council to ask the team who works on this important project to think about it and revise the proposal.

1742
02:29:25,561 --> 02:29:25,882
[SPEAKER_46]: Thank you.

1743
02:29:26,682 --> 02:29:26,922
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1744
02:29:26,942 --> 02:29:30,864
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm going to go to Eileen Lerner on Zoom.

1745
02:29:35,907 --> 02:29:36,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me?

1746
02:29:37,530 --> 02:29:39,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, can you hear me now?

1747
02:29:40,072 --> 02:30:02,168
[SPEAKER_05]: I I stand in opposition to the development I too feel we need affordable housing, but this is definitely not the project that we need Um, and I because of all the reasons that have been raised so far But also I have another question that has not been answered which is what did the um

1748
02:30:03,497 --> 02:30:13,303
[SPEAKER_05]: the environmental review of the site revealed, because someone at one of the meetings did admit that they found some chemicals in the soil.

1749
02:30:13,323 --> 02:30:18,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked, well, I asked, what are the chemicals?

1750
02:30:19,106 --> 02:30:21,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Have they been removed?

1751
02:30:22,108 --> 02:30:28,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if they need to be removed, how much is it going to cost to do the remediation?

1752
02:30:30,325 --> 02:30:37,012
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just don't think this is an appropriate site for all the reasons that the previous speakers have raised.

1753
02:30:37,953 --> 02:30:39,675
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you for listening.

1754
02:30:40,976 --> 02:30:41,296
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1755
02:30:41,316 --> 02:30:47,082
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition of the project, either in person or on Zoom?

1756
02:30:51,587 --> 02:30:52,208
[SPEAKER_42]: Seeing none.

1757
02:30:54,245 --> 02:30:55,586
[SPEAKER_42]: We're sure the public hearing is closed.

1758
02:30:55,706 --> 02:30:57,386
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there any additional questions from counselors?

1759
02:30:57,406 --> 02:31:00,128
[SPEAKER_42]: And I know we have like one or two hanging questions from residents.

1760
02:31:00,188 --> 02:31:13,734
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't know if Mr. Chicarello or executive director Driscoll, as far as like their findings from the environmental study, if that's something that's shared or public or anyone can speak to that.

1761
02:31:13,754 --> 02:31:18,336
[SPEAKER_39]: I think the questions are just.

1762
02:31:20,123 --> 02:31:25,266
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah, just the question just being, you know, what was found and, you know, what the remediation steps are.

1763
02:31:28,547 --> 02:31:29,968
[SPEAKER_42]: Just name and address for the record, please.

1764
02:31:30,068 --> 02:31:33,289
[SPEAKER_28]: My name is Danny Garbo-Leticia with Dietzen Company Architects.

1765
02:31:35,230 --> 02:31:39,813
[SPEAKER_19]: Also about Liz with Fossil O'Neill.

1766
02:31:39,973 --> 02:31:40,553
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

1767
02:31:41,133 --> 02:31:43,995
[SPEAKER_28]: All the soil results should be public.

1768
02:31:44,015 --> 02:31:48,477
[SPEAKER_28]: It should be part of the packages that we have submitted, and we're getting more information.

1769
02:31:49,153 --> 02:31:57,564
[SPEAKER_28]: uh... and that will be public absolutely okay so those of you who are online yes it will be public and in general

1770
02:31:58,812 --> 02:32:00,152
[SPEAKER_19]: Most of the site is urban feel.

1771
02:32:00,992 --> 02:32:06,073
[SPEAKER_19]: And as most of us know, urban feel back in the days was not really controlled.

1772
02:32:06,873 --> 02:32:15,475
[SPEAKER_19]: So we, and I don't want to get technical about stuff that's in there, but we have not really found anything there that is not common urban feel around Massachusetts.

1773
02:32:16,555 --> 02:32:23,656
[SPEAKER_19]: And the idea is that we're still going on investigations to fully delineate what's in there.

1774
02:32:24,856 --> 02:32:26,537
[SPEAKER_19]: But by the time the project is done,

1775
02:32:29,588 --> 02:32:34,509
[SPEAKER_19]: we are following all the states and federal regulations to really clean up the site.

1776
02:32:36,530 --> 02:32:37,210
[SPEAKER_19]: So, yeah.

1777
02:32:37,370 --> 02:32:48,733
[SPEAKER_19]: So, like, if somebody wants to get more technical, yeah, all these reports and ongoing investigation are part of the submissions, and we'll be including any further submissions, especially during the special permit process.

1778
02:32:49,653 --> 02:32:49,973
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1779
02:32:52,273 --> 02:32:55,474
[SPEAKER_42]: Any other questions from councillors or discussion from councillors at this time?

1780
02:32:57,595 --> 02:32:58,255
[SPEAKER_42]: Councillor Craviel.

1781
02:32:58,937 --> 02:33:01,698
[SPEAKER_21]: So is there anything in the soil that prevents housing?

1782
02:33:02,738 --> 02:33:05,159
[SPEAKER_21]: Maybe I didn't understand this question, but.

1783
02:33:11,480 --> 02:33:12,481
[SPEAKER_15]: You can answer this.

1784
02:33:14,361 --> 02:33:14,601
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.

1785
02:33:15,061 --> 02:33:17,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam President, Councilor Caviello.

1786
02:33:17,822 --> 02:33:28,625
[SPEAKER_15]: So under state regulation, if they were to find anything that were to not allow housing, they must by law clean it up before they could build housing there.

1787
02:33:29,035 --> 02:33:34,219
[SPEAKER_15]: So either the results will find nothing that's a problem, or they must clean it up.

1788
02:33:34,540 --> 02:33:37,863
[SPEAKER_15]: They cannot build the housing under state law with this.

1789
02:33:37,983 --> 02:33:53,456
[SPEAKER_15]: And when you do a project like this, you have somebody called a licensed site professional that holds professional license that they could lose if they don't actually make sure we follow the law as part of that process, which is why I have complete confidence that it would be completely safe to live there.

1790
02:33:53,876 --> 02:33:56,178
[SPEAKER_15]: The standards for residential are much higher.

1791
02:33:56,579 --> 02:33:59,060
[SPEAKER_15]: than most of the other standards that you'll find.

1792
02:33:59,080 --> 02:34:00,761
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1793
02:34:01,861 --> 02:34:03,742
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Collins.

1794
02:34:05,002 --> 02:34:06,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Morrell.

1795
02:34:06,123 --> 02:34:15,106
[SPEAKER_16]: I have some general comments, but I know a lot of commenters brought up concerns about traffic in the neighborhood, which I know is an existing concern for the neighborhood as is.

1796
02:34:15,486 --> 02:34:17,367
[SPEAKER_16]: We brought our previous meeting on this topic.

1797
02:34:18,295 --> 02:34:34,521
[SPEAKER_16]: We did get some more in-depth analysis of how the MHA arrived at the recommendation of 0.5 parking spaces per unit, and as I recall, at the time there was even some discussion about are we even overshooting the need based on the analysis of residents and frequent visitors and staff.

1798
02:34:35,541 --> 02:34:41,383
[SPEAKER_16]: Since that was raised a lot in this meeting, I was just curious if the MHA wanted to speak to that.

1799
02:34:42,182 --> 02:34:52,047
[SPEAKER_16]: While we have this platform for further discussion, just because my recollection was that this number was arrived at after rounding up rather than rounding down.

1800
02:34:52,307 --> 02:35:01,352
[SPEAKER_27]: So what we're actually proposing more parking than the 0.5, it's 0.5 spaces for the senior disabled mid-rise.

1801
02:35:01,452 --> 02:35:04,554
[SPEAKER_27]: The family units are getting at one parking space per.

1802
02:35:05,276 --> 02:35:11,399
[SPEAKER_27]: So yeah, but for the phase one senior mid-rise building, it's 0.5 spaces.

1803
02:35:12,860 --> 02:35:21,265
[SPEAKER_27]: But yeah, each family unit will get one space because families tend to be, most families may have a car in the household.

1804
02:35:22,025 --> 02:35:29,469
[SPEAKER_27]: Even though in affordable housing, it's very expensive to own a car nowadays, but we feel that one space per household is adequate.

1805
02:35:30,409 --> 02:35:31,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1806
02:35:31,310 --> 02:35:31,610
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1807
02:35:33,051 --> 02:35:34,832
[SPEAKER_42]: Further discussion from counselors?

1808
02:35:39,685 --> 02:35:41,726
[SPEAKER_42]: Do I have a motion?

1809
02:35:43,848 --> 02:35:44,468
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Collins?

1810
02:35:45,889 --> 02:35:53,494
[SPEAKER_16]: If there is no further discussion from my fellow councilors, I would motion to approve pending the public comment period, if that's the appropriate motion for this public hearing.

1811
02:35:55,015 --> 02:35:57,416
[SPEAKER_42]: Public hearing, yeah, the six-day public comment period, yes.

1812
02:35:57,636 --> 02:36:04,161
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have a motion from Councilor Collins to approve pending the six-day public comment period.

1813
02:36:05,201 --> 02:36:06,202
[SPEAKER_42]: Seconded by the vice of affairs.

1814
02:36:06,242 --> 02:36:07,703
[SPEAKER_42]: If there's no further discussion,

1815
02:36:09,292 --> 02:36:10,293
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1816
02:36:10,533 --> 02:36:23,699
[SPEAKER_42]: And this is again for the zoning change that has been presented to us tonight, understanding that if approved, then there would be a whole site plan review process that would exist and lots of meetings and opportunity for engagement on that as well.

1817
02:36:25,339 --> 02:36:26,280
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1818
02:36:27,740 --> 02:36:28,461
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Pierce.

1819

[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

1820
02:36:29,961 --> 02:36:30,502
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Kerrio.

1821
02:36:30,542 --> 02:36:30,782
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

1822
02:36:32,643 --> 02:36:33,183
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Collins.

[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

02:36:35,064 --> 02:36:35,504
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Leitch.

1825
02:36:35,524 --> 02:36:35,584
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

02:36:52,744 --> 02:36:53,004
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

1827
02:36:54,125 --> 02:36:57,849
[SPEAKER_42]: Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

1828
02:37:00,392 --> 02:37:01,353
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you everyone for being here.

1829
02:37:09,190 --> 02:37:18,854
[SPEAKER_42]: going to petitions, presentations, and similar papers.

02:37:27,018 --> 02:37:30,842
[SPEAKER_42]: I have a motion from Councilor Sang to waive the reading.

1833

[SPEAKER_42]: I'm just going to finish reading the heading.

1834
02:37:35,425 --> 02:37:36,186
[SPEAKER_42]: I appreciate it.

1835
02:37:36,306 --> 02:37:36,967
[SPEAKER_42]: I appreciate you stopping.

1836
02:37:36,987 --> 02:37:38,128
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm just going to go on through the heading.

1837
02:37:38,168 --> 02:37:50,919
[SPEAKER_42]: So to City Council President Nicole Morel and all members of the City Council from Office of Planning Development Sustainability, date November 9th, 2023, regarding the proposed MBTA communities multifamily overlay district

02:37:51,779 --> 02:38:11,661
[SPEAKER_42]: quote wellington station multifamily overlay district so we have a motion from councillor saying to waive the reading in lieu of a overview from i believe director hunt will probably provide that or either planner evans second by yeah we'll wait for the um yeah um

1839
02:38:13,048 --> 02:38:18,911
[SPEAKER_42]: Folks, just for audio purposes, if you could just go into the hall for conversations.

1840
02:38:18,951 --> 02:38:22,893
[SPEAKER_42]: I appreciate it, just so it gets picked up pretty robustly on our mics.

1841
02:38:37,641 --> 02:38:39,262
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have a motion.

1842
02:38:39,302 --> 02:38:40,803
[SPEAKER_42]: You still can't hear?

1843
02:38:43,363 --> 02:38:50,045
[SPEAKER_42]: Folks, folks, if we could just, if we could just move conversations into the hallway so we can continue the meeting without, so we can, folks can hear.

1844
02:38:50,065 --> 02:39:01,609
[SPEAKER_42]: It just gets picked up really easily on the audio and it's hard to hear for folks at home and here.

1845
02:39:06,350 --> 02:39:06,810
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1846
02:39:07,590 --> 02:39:07,850
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

1847
02:39:10,758 --> 02:39:19,342
[SPEAKER_42]: So we have a motion to waive the reading in lieu of a brief synopsis from our PDS team, from Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Garbaillo.

1848
02:39:19,382 --> 02:39:25,245
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll, because it looks like Councilor Knight is still with us, but not with us.

1849
02:39:25,265 --> 02:39:26,545
[SPEAKER_42]: So call the roll.

1850
02:39:30,407 --> 02:39:31,027
[SPEAKER_42]: OK, great.

1851
02:39:31,047 --> 02:39:31,387
[SPEAKER_42]: You're right.

1852
02:39:31,547 --> 02:39:31,868
[SPEAKER_42]: Sorry.

1853
02:39:32,448 --> 02:39:33,568
[SPEAKER_42]: And we talked about it.

1854
02:39:33,588 --> 02:39:34,829
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Behrs.

1855
02:39:39,462 --> 02:39:40,242
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Kerrio.

1856
02:39:40,663 --> 02:39:42,344
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Collins.

1857
02:39:47,807 --> 02:39:49,728
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Bates.

1858
02:39:49,748 --> 02:39:50,969
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Schell.

1859
02:39:51,409 --> 02:39:51,629
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

1860
02:39:51,649 --> 02:39:53,550
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor San Buenaventura.

1861
02:39:53,570 --> 02:39:53,670
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

1862
02:39:53,690 --> 02:39:54,911
[SPEAKER_42]: 16 in favor, negative one absent.

1863
02:39:55,311 --> 02:40:01,454
[SPEAKER_42]: We're going to suspend the reading for a brief overview from our planning development sustainability team.

1864
02:40:01,554 --> 02:40:07,678
[SPEAKER_42]: And again, this is about the proposed MBTA communities, multifamily overlay district quote, Wellington station multifamily overlay district.

1865
02:40:08,608 --> 02:40:15,189
[SPEAKER_42]: So we will go to Planner Evans, or Director Evans.

1866
02:40:15,289 --> 02:40:17,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, I'm Danielle Evans, Senior Planner.

1867
02:40:18,070 --> 02:40:37,254
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the referral meeting, so not the public hearing, not the time to talk about any substantive content of the draft ordinance, but basically, just to give you some background, this has been a long planning effort

1868
02:40:37,876 --> 02:40:48,963
[SPEAKER_11]: Last summer, we were able to hire a consultant for free provided by Mass Housing Partnership that analyzed parcel by parcel around all of the eligible station areas.

1869
02:40:49,724 --> 02:41:03,373
[SPEAKER_11]: And there is a compliance model that you enter in all of the parcel information, all of the zoning inputs, and then it spits out how many units could conceivably yield.

1870
02:41:03,860 --> 02:41:08,282
[SPEAKER_11]: And the number that we're mandated to have is 6,443, I believe.

1871
02:41:09,202 --> 02:41:21,266
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you take out all of the excluded land, like Tufts University, META-owned land, open space, the only real place that worked was Wellington Station.

1872
02:41:21,647 --> 02:41:33,491
[SPEAKER_11]: So we moved forward with drafting an amendment to create what we're calling the Wellington Station Multifamily Overlay District, which would be, you know,

1873
02:41:34,342 --> 02:41:43,048
[SPEAKER_11]: what an overlay is, that it would be on top of the existing underlying zoning, which is the mixed use zoning districts and industrial.

1874
02:41:43,669 --> 02:41:50,994
[SPEAKER_11]: And across 28, I believe there's more industrial or maybe an apartment three.

1875
02:41:54,596 --> 02:41:58,699
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first public hearing would be tomorrow at the Community Development Board.

1876
02:42:00,340 --> 02:42:02,882
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a very quick timeline as a

1877
02:42:03,943 --> 02:42:05,643
[SPEAKER_11]: the public hearing on December 12th.

1878
02:42:05,663 --> 02:42:06,944
[SPEAKER_11]: As a subway community.

1879
02:42:06,964 --> 02:42:09,624
[SPEAKER_11]: We are supposed to have this approved by the end of the year.

1880
02:42:09,644 --> 02:42:12,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Um we have advertised.

1881
02:42:13,145 --> 02:42:19,087
[SPEAKER_11]: The public hearing to come to you all City Council on December 12th.

1882
02:42:22,087 --> 02:42:22,667
[SPEAKER_15]: So just to be

1883
02:42:29,608 --> 02:42:31,589
[SPEAKER_15]: at the end of the month for two meetings.

1884
02:42:31,669 --> 02:42:37,133
[SPEAKER_15]: If they decide they don't want to pass, they want to review it for two meetings before sending you a recommendation.

1885
02:42:37,153 --> 02:42:42,576
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the city council has two meetings in December, which gives you that timeline.

1886
02:42:42,596 --> 02:42:53,943
[SPEAKER_15]: We've also offered that we can do a committee of the whole, our zoning consultant has offered to come in and do what she's calling for other communities, MBTA zoning 101.

1887
02:42:54,979 --> 02:43:08,392
[SPEAKER_15]: where she would come in and talk about the whole MBTA zoning, do that briefing for about an hour, one evening, and then have, so that when you're presented with the zoning itself, you've already gotten that background on it.

1888
02:43:08,832 --> 02:43:19,903
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want, we could actually use that Committee of the Whole to talk about Medford-specific zoning, although it might be awkward because it would be in the middle of the CD board

1889
02:43:20,823 --> 02:43:25,465
[SPEAKER_15]: public hearing process, and it would be right before you open your own public hearing on it.

1890
02:43:25,485 --> 02:43:31,928
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm not really sure how that would line up, but we're happy to have the consultant come in and talk about the MBT zoning as well.

1891
02:43:32,429 --> 02:43:38,331
[SPEAKER_15]: But the item on the agenda tonight, this is, as you all know, with zoning, is a legal required referral.

1892
02:43:38,992 --> 02:43:41,413
[SPEAKER_15]: The board actually, the council doesn't actually have a choice.

1893
02:43:41,473 --> 02:43:43,934
[SPEAKER_15]: They have to refer it to the CD board for comment tonight.

1894
02:43:44,534 --> 02:43:44,975
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

1895
02:43:46,917 --> 02:43:47,658
[SPEAKER_36]: Just a quick question.

1896
02:43:47,998 --> 02:43:50,239
[SPEAKER_36]: What do the residents in Wilmington say?

1897
02:43:51,040 --> 02:44:03,809
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've held one public meeting on this and the reality is we have to pass this to stay in compliance with the state and we cannot do it, we can't make it work in any other part of the city.

1898
02:44:04,189 --> 02:44:06,290
[SPEAKER_36]: So will the residents of Wilmington know about this?

1899
02:44:07,051 --> 02:44:09,833
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what they know about it.

1900
02:44:09,993 --> 02:44:12,515
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been advertised to as the rest of the city has.

1901
02:44:14,528 --> 02:44:16,649
[SPEAKER_36]: Again, it's the same situation.

1902
02:44:17,249 --> 02:44:18,550
[SPEAKER_36]: It's really the same situation.

1903
02:44:18,990 --> 02:44:22,391
[SPEAKER_36]: You're in front of us today to hold something through that has to be accepted tonight.

1904
02:44:23,132 --> 02:44:27,013
[SPEAKER_15]: This is actually the zoning.

1905
02:44:28,474 --> 02:44:40,778
[SPEAKER_36]: When a zoning amendment comes to this council from anybody whatsoever, you have to- I know that, but the way you presented it, it seems like even after this process, it seems like it's going to go pretty quick.

1906
02:44:41,038 --> 02:44:41,999
[SPEAKER_36]: It has to be done right away.

1907
02:44:43,343 --> 02:44:44,684
[SPEAKER_15]: You may take that up with the state.

1908
02:44:44,825 --> 02:44:46,346
[SPEAKER_15]: I am very sorry about that.

1909
02:44:48,088 --> 02:44:50,951
[SPEAKER_15]: We have argued with the state many times about this timeline.

1910
02:44:51,011 --> 02:44:52,252
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't like it.

1911
02:44:52,613 --> 02:44:56,457
[SPEAKER_15]: They've changed the rules on us several times since this law was passed.

1912
02:44:56,917 --> 02:44:58,078
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't like that either.

1913
02:44:58,098 --> 02:45:04,585
[SPEAKER_15]: They actually, after our last meeting with the state, gave us more consulting time and provided additional free consulting to us.

1914
02:45:05,133 --> 02:45:08,735
[SPEAKER_15]: but the state timeline does not allow for very much public input.

1915
02:45:08,855 --> 02:45:13,437
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had a public meeting on it, and we will have two public hearings on it.

1916
02:45:14,118 --> 02:45:15,258
[SPEAKER_36]: One public meeting on it?

1917
02:45:15,618 --> 02:45:15,839
[SPEAKER_36]: Yeah.

1918
02:45:16,119 --> 02:45:17,359
[SPEAKER_36]: So when did we find out about it?

1919
02:45:17,399 --> 02:45:19,040
[SPEAKER_36]: When did your office find out about it?

1920
02:45:20,501 --> 02:45:27,745
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been out there for more than a year, but they've changed the rules on it, and the regulations came out in May.

1921
02:45:28,385 --> 02:45:34,108
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've only had the regulations to work within the compliance model since May.

1922
02:45:34,730 --> 02:45:35,670
[SPEAKER_11]: August, actually.

1923
02:45:35,931 --> 02:45:40,953
[SPEAKER_11]: They revised it in August with an end of December deadline.

1924
02:45:40,973 --> 02:45:43,994
[SPEAKER_11]: I was pulling my hair out.

1925
02:45:44,014 --> 02:45:53,498
[SPEAKER_36]: Again, these are things that, some things that just out of your control, but in the totality of these processes, it just doesn't look good.

1926
02:45:53,838 --> 02:45:55,518
[SPEAKER_36]: It's no different than the voting situation.

1927
02:45:55,938 --> 02:45:57,099
[SPEAKER_36]: It just doesn't look good.

1928
02:45:57,639 --> 02:45:59,260
[SPEAKER_36]: I consistently get,

1929
02:46:00,722 --> 02:46:04,885
[SPEAKER_36]: constituents that reach out and say, we knew nothing about this.

1930
02:46:04,985 --> 02:46:05,985
[SPEAKER_36]: We didn't hear this.

1931
02:46:06,606 --> 02:46:25,258
[SPEAKER_36]: And so I think, you know, as a council, we need to figure out a way whenever we put these projects out, that there's gotta be some assistance that if they don't have the funding or anything that has to be done, because the biggest issues we have to come back to us are the constituents that they knew nothing about this.

1932
02:46:26,402 --> 02:46:34,825
[SPEAKER_36]: I, you know, I, we, we had, we were fortunate enough with the last speaker, the last project that the housing authority did a lot of the legwork.

1933
02:46:36,203 --> 02:46:38,324
[SPEAKER_36]: on their dime or the way they processed it.

1934
02:46:38,364 --> 02:46:42,986
[SPEAKER_36]: But this is something that I'm hearing over and over again, especially the last week.

1935
02:46:43,686 --> 02:46:47,648
[SPEAKER_36]: So I appreciate it, and I understand that the situation's a little different.

1936
02:46:47,708 --> 02:46:50,649
[SPEAKER_36]: And it's just not fair, because I know what's going to happen.

1937
02:46:50,989 --> 02:46:52,110
[SPEAKER_36]: We're going to get phone calls tomorrow.

1938
02:46:52,130 --> 02:46:54,691
[SPEAKER_36]: The people who watch this will all have to say, you don't care about us.

1939
02:46:55,411 --> 02:46:56,011
[SPEAKER_36]: The answer is easy.

1940
02:46:56,031 --> 02:47:01,314
[SPEAKER_36]: At least we know now we can say this is state mandated, and this is a situation, and it's out of our hands.

1941
02:47:01,394 --> 02:47:02,954
[SPEAKER_36]: But it just doesn't.

1942
02:47:05,657 --> 02:47:06,457
[SPEAKER_36]: just doesn't look good.

1943
02:47:06,818 --> 02:47:07,158
[SPEAKER_36]: That's all.

1944
02:47:07,378 --> 02:47:07,718
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

1945
02:47:08,038 --> 02:47:15,042
[SPEAKER_15]: So we would appreciate any assistance in getting the word out to people and letting them know about it, asking them to attend the meetings.

1946
02:47:16,182 --> 02:47:23,646
[SPEAKER_15]: And we do put out a newsletter as well from our office that we try and sign people up to, so they'll know about these meetings as well.

1947
02:47:23,666 --> 02:47:26,827
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Behrs, and then Councilor Sayegh.

1948
02:47:27,207 --> 02:47:28,268
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

1949
02:47:28,308 --> 02:47:31,189
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you guys for pulling this together.

1950
02:47:31,209 --> 02:47:32,270
[SPEAKER_24]: I know

1951
02:47:33,423 --> 02:47:37,146
[SPEAKER_24]: It has been a bumpy road with the state process, and I can appreciate that.

1952
02:47:38,027 --> 02:47:54,782
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to kind of put this in the context of the work that we're hopefully going to be talking about hiring someone to work with us very soon, since I think the procurement, the RFPs are due by Thursday, and I'm waiting for the second phase of our zoning work.

1953
02:47:56,120 --> 02:48:07,262
[SPEAKER_24]: It's my understanding that this is what we need to get into compliance with the law by the deadline that the law requires us to be in compliance by.

1954
02:48:07,722 --> 02:48:20,204
[SPEAKER_24]: But as we move through the process of looking at the zoning, we could potentially go more in depth on that area, additional changes, look at this district and potentially make adjustments to this district through that process.

1955
02:48:20,224 --> 02:48:23,545
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanna make sure that's correct and that's your understanding as well.

1956
02:48:24,770 --> 02:48:31,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I imagine with a comprehensive rezoning of the city that we would change the underlying zoning.

1957
02:48:31,772 --> 02:48:37,614
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's one great thing about the overlay is it doesn't affect the underlying.

1958
02:48:38,134 --> 02:48:45,917
[SPEAKER_11]: And we could always amend the overlay, which is one great advantage of being a city is that we have many bites at the apple.

1959
02:48:45,957 --> 02:48:47,097
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like town meeting.

1960
02:48:49,618 --> 02:48:53,439
[SPEAKER_11]: There's two MBTA communities that are rapid transit

1961
02:48:53,857 --> 02:48:57,901
[SPEAKER_11]: that also have the same deadline, and they go by town meeting.

1962
02:48:57,941 --> 02:49:04,346
[SPEAKER_11]: And they're really going crazy, because they would have another year that they might have to live with something that they don't like.

1963
02:49:05,107 --> 02:49:07,429
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, this is a state meeting.

1964
02:49:07,489 --> 02:49:08,630
[SPEAKER_24]: Arlington just passed theirs, I think.

1965
02:49:09,831 --> 02:49:12,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Arlington's ahead of the game, I think.

1966
02:49:13,374 --> 02:49:14,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1967
02:49:14,095 --> 02:49:14,235
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1968
02:49:14,835 --> 02:49:22,298
[SPEAKER_11]: But interesting enough, this is actually sort of down zoning, because believe it or not, we actually allow quite a bit of housing units.

1969
02:49:22,678 --> 02:49:27,680
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just tweaking it so that it's by right with site plan review.

1970
02:49:28,301 --> 02:49:34,463
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're having an economic feasibility analysis done so that we can keep our inclusionary zoning.

1971
02:49:34,483 --> 02:49:37,084
[SPEAKER_11]: We're hoping that will be completed soon.

1972
02:49:37,505 --> 02:49:43,087
[SPEAKER_11]: But when I say that we're down zoning, basically what we've done is to build in incentives to go higher

1973
02:49:44,036 --> 02:49:50,677
[SPEAKER_11]: by providing more affordability or ground floor retail, since we can't require that.

1974
02:49:51,017 --> 02:49:57,358
[SPEAKER_11]: So around a transit station, you would want it to be walkable and for there to be amenities to the people that live there.

1975
02:49:57,778 --> 02:50:00,879
[SPEAKER_11]: But unfortunately, the law doesn't allow us to mandate that.

1976
02:50:01,259 --> 02:50:02,879
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're building in incentives.

1977
02:50:03,339 --> 02:50:13,001
[SPEAKER_11]: So hoping that developers would do these things so that they can go higher, which is pretty much already allowed in the MUC.

1978
02:50:13,755 --> 02:50:22,262
[SPEAKER_11]: So it won't be, it sounds scary, but it's not mandating that any of those units actually get built, but that they'd be zoned so they could be built.

1979
02:50:22,302 --> 02:50:24,124
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of it's built out.

1980
02:50:24,804 --> 02:50:35,033
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel like the big planning and ambitious work that our office does, like this isn't gonna be the panacea that solves the housing crisis.

1981
02:50:35,053 --> 02:50:42,479
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that we're doing a lot of other things in Medford and we've tried to tailor this to work for the city.

1982
02:50:42,970 --> 02:50:45,892
[SPEAKER_11]: in a way that furthers all of our goals in a comprehensive way.

1983
02:50:46,552 --> 02:50:47,213
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, thank you.

1984
02:50:47,233 --> 02:50:51,255
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just wanted to put that forward just to say that this is not the end all be all here.

1985
02:50:51,716 --> 02:51:02,603
[SPEAKER_24]: And we have discussed extensively that this council is planning to conduct an extensive public process over the next 18 months to two years on rezoning the community.

1986
02:51:02,623 --> 02:51:09,027
[SPEAKER_24]: I think there is no public process that will satisfy all people.

1987
02:51:10,628 --> 02:51:12,369
[SPEAKER_24]: I do think that doesn't mean that we can't make

1988
02:51:13,540 --> 02:51:20,344
[SPEAKER_24]: and even better effort than we are able to do with the resources that we are appropriated by the mayor to reach as many people as possible.

1989
02:51:20,864 --> 02:51:29,629
[SPEAKER_24]: But I'm really looking forward to the deep work that we're going to be doing together in partnership.

1990
02:51:29,669 --> 02:51:32,050
[SPEAKER_24]: And I say all of that because I'm super excited for it.

1991
02:51:32,437 --> 02:51:40,584
[SPEAKER_24]: I do wanna say, I wish we had seen something or had a meeting on this a little sooner, not necessarily on the draft, but just on the law itself.

1992
02:51:40,624 --> 02:51:42,566
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know we've had, did we?

1993
02:51:42,586 --> 02:51:44,627
[SPEAKER_11]: I just, sorry, well over a year ago.

1994
02:51:44,647 --> 02:51:46,749
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's been so long that I've forgotten.

1995
02:51:46,829 --> 02:51:48,371
[SPEAKER_24]: No, you're not to contradict you.

1996
02:51:48,391 --> 02:51:49,792
[SPEAKER_24]: No, no, no, I take the contradiction.

1997
02:51:49,832 --> 02:51:53,615
[SPEAKER_15]: But I did just thought, because I was like, we put together a webpage for this.

1998
02:51:53,635 --> 02:51:54,456
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember that.

1999
02:51:54,476 --> 02:51:56,918
[SPEAKER_15]: And the webpage exists and on the webpage,

2000
02:51:57,445 --> 02:52:01,892
[SPEAKER_15]: It has a link to the presentation that we made to this council on March 22nd, 2022.

2001
02:52:01,952 --> 02:52:02,733
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes.

2002
02:52:02,793 --> 02:52:03,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

2003
02:52:03,294 --> 02:52:04,496
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2004
02:52:05,518 --> 02:52:08,522
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was like right after it passed.

2005
02:52:08,703 --> 02:52:09,945
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we should have checked it in between.

2006
02:52:11,655 --> 02:52:14,378
[SPEAKER_24]: And I don't put that blame on any one party.

2007
02:52:14,798 --> 02:52:18,562
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously, I forgot that meeting two years ago too.

2008
02:52:19,043 --> 02:52:21,665
[SPEAKER_24]: And George just called me a slacker if anyone couldn't hear it.

2009
02:52:23,127 --> 02:52:28,312
[SPEAKER_24]: But no, you know, we're just, we're good friends.

2010
02:52:29,213 --> 02:52:30,214
[SPEAKER_24]: But I just,

2011
02:52:32,121 --> 02:52:51,417
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm really excited for that partnership, and I appreciate the work that your office has done on this, and worked through an incredibly difficult landscape of changing rules and regulations, and a change in the entire gubernatorial administration from the folks who passed this, and they even renamed the office that was working on it with you, I think, and reorganized it, so I know that's been really difficult.

2012
02:52:52,678 --> 02:52:54,819
[SPEAKER_24]: And I appreciate that we'll be able to come back and look at this again.

2013
02:52:54,839 --> 02:53:02,743
[SPEAKER_24]: And even though that this is what the law requires, that you've been thoughtful about making sure that what we actually want in that area is also still possible.

2014
02:53:06,276 --> 02:53:06,636
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2015
02:53:06,876 --> 02:53:09,377
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I wanted to thank you guys for your work on this as well.

2016
02:53:09,917 --> 02:53:21,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I know it's really difficult working within the parameters of a state mandate that keeps changing, um, and to get us product before the deadline, I think is an achievement that we should acknowledge.

2017
02:53:22,760 --> 02:53:29,161
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I, I think there's, there'll be some time for people to comment on this and for adjustments to be made.

2018
02:53:29,741 --> 02:53:36,043
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I think we understand the council understands our tasks tonight, um, and what our vote means and the way that

2019
02:53:36,863 --> 02:53:37,944
[SPEAKER_22]: in my opinion it should go.

2020
02:53:38,744 --> 02:53:47,188
[SPEAKER_22]: But I also wanted to say as a resident or as a former resident of Wellington, I am excited to see more action happening there.

2021
02:53:47,208 --> 02:53:49,549
[SPEAKER_22]: I know a lot of residents on the ground feel that as well.

2022
02:53:50,329 --> 02:53:51,230
[SPEAKER_22]: I know that we've had

2023
02:53:52,686 --> 02:53:55,348
[SPEAKER_22]: a lot of conversations about safety and walkability there.

2024
02:53:55,468 --> 02:54:06,558
[SPEAKER_22]: And a more comprehensive plan like this with more incentives built into it creates, I think, an ideal vision, a more ideal vision in that sense.

2025
02:54:07,538 --> 02:54:19,668
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe we make some tweaks, but a more ideal version of what we have that creates a safer neighborhood by making it more walkable and more to incentivize attention to that behavior.

2026
02:54:20,489 --> 02:54:22,090
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm really grateful for your work on this.

2027
02:54:22,191 --> 02:54:29,858
[SPEAKER_22]: I know there have been folks writing me about reducing parking minimums even more given the proximity to the station.

2028
02:54:30,478 --> 02:54:33,021
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that's something worthy of being talked about.

2029
02:54:33,841 --> 02:54:41,989
[SPEAKER_22]: But in any case, we'll get into the details with the CD board and with what they recommend, but I'm just very grateful for your work.

2030
02:54:43,050 --> 02:54:43,731
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Councilor Sviggum.

2031
02:54:43,811 --> 02:54:44,451
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Cravio.

2032
02:54:44,471 --> 02:54:45,112
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Mayor President.

2033
02:54:46,584 --> 02:54:53,686
[SPEAKER_21]: I know, Alicia, I know we have talked about this in the past, but what's the status with the T fighting us on this?

2034
02:54:55,127 --> 02:54:57,008
[SPEAKER_15]: I know they want to put the- The air rights in that.

2035
02:54:57,148 --> 02:55:10,332
[SPEAKER_15]: So just for full transparency, while this overlay literally includes the MBTA parcel, it legally does not because legally the MBTA is not bound by our zoning.

2036
02:55:11,350 --> 02:55:16,994
[SPEAKER_15]: But if it was to be used for other things, I mean, the air rights and all could fall under this.

2037
02:55:20,056 --> 02:55:40,630
[SPEAKER_15]: We have not had any very recent conversations with the MBTA about their bus facility location, but we have also been talking with the Resilient Mystic Collaborative and doing a lower mystic watershed assessment of buildings and large developments and things and critical infrastructure.

2038
02:55:41,164 --> 02:56:04,722
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the Resilient Mystic collaborative is now actually pushing back on the idea that we shouldn't be building new critical infrastructure in serious flood zone locations, and that there may be a very questionable choice to be building one of two electric bus repair and charging stations in an area that's at a high flood zone risk, whereas if you were building

2039
02:56:05,262 --> 02:56:11,366
[SPEAKER_15]: parking with apartments on top, that could be built in a way that could handle being in a flood zone.

2040
02:56:11,766 --> 02:56:19,311
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas if an electric bus repair facility was flooded, that could ruin the whole thing.

2041
02:56:20,271 --> 02:56:24,574
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't see how they could flood proof that from saltwater flooding.

2042
02:56:25,294 --> 02:56:29,117
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is a concern that is being raised to the MBTA at this time.

2043
02:56:29,137 --> 02:56:34,480
[SPEAKER_15]: The big difficulty is they don't know where else to put that bus facility.

2044
02:56:35,033 --> 02:56:37,134
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, the train station is also a flood zone.

2045
02:56:37,514 --> 02:56:47,057
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's a little different because that train station doesn't support all the trains for the entire MBTA fleet.

2046
02:56:47,417 --> 02:56:54,640
[SPEAKER_15]: They're talking about putting a bus depot there that would support half the buses for the entire MBTA regional bus fleet.

2047
02:56:55,480 --> 02:56:57,861
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's perhaps not the right place for that.

2048
02:56:58,601 --> 02:57:04,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas if that location flooded right now, it would knock out one branch of the Orange Line.

2049
02:57:04,534 --> 02:57:07,897
[SPEAKER_15]: that's not great, but that's not their entire system.

2050
02:57:08,057 --> 02:57:12,060
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's also not their evacuation system in the event of a major emergency.

2051
02:57:12,461 --> 02:57:21,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas one could picture if we needed to evacuate the floodable areas in the greater Boston area, we're going to start putting people in buses, right?

2052
02:57:21,068 --> 02:57:22,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Like that, obviously.

2053
02:57:23,230 --> 02:57:26,012
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's, we're starting to raise some of these issues with them.

2054
02:57:26,533 --> 02:57:32,618
[SPEAKER_21]: So also in the flood area, how does that affect the building process?

2055
02:57:33,633 --> 02:57:44,079
[SPEAKER_15]: It just includes, there's regulations about how do they have to build so that they can handle withstand flood, things like building certain building standards.

2056
02:57:44,480 --> 02:57:50,463
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's very different when it's a building than something like a piece of critical infrastructure.

2057
02:57:50,483 --> 02:57:54,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

2058
02:57:55,006 --> 02:57:55,827
[SPEAKER_42]: Does that answer your question?

2059
02:57:55,867 --> 02:57:56,107
[SPEAKER_42]: Yeah.

2060
02:57:58,909 --> 02:58:00,670
[SPEAKER_42]: Any further discussion or do I have a motion?

2061
02:58:02,665 --> 02:58:04,126
[SPEAKER_39]: Motion to refer to Community Development Board.

2062
02:58:04,186 --> 02:58:04,726
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

2063
02:58:06,307 --> 02:58:10,389
[SPEAKER_42]: I have a motion to refer to Community Development Board, seconded by Councilor Sang.

[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, the motion passes.

[SPEAKER_24]: Madam President, motion to suspend the rules to take paper 23447.

2070
02:58:38,620 --> 02:58:42,664
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion of Vice President Behrs to suspend the rules to take paper 23447.

2071
02:58:42,704 --> 02:58:46,227
[SPEAKER_42]: I am confident that Councilor Ntukai is here, so we're going to take this as a voice vote.

2072
02:58:46,907 --> 02:58:47,788
[SPEAKER_42]: Seconded by Councilor Sang.

2073
02:58:47,828 --> 02:58:48,408
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

2074
02:58:48,428 --> 02:58:48,548
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

2075
02:58:49,229 --> 02:58:50,030
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

2076
02:58:50,090 --> 02:58:50,710
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

2077
02:58:50,770 --> 02:58:56,075
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm going to have Vice President Behrs assume the chair for a moment.

2078
02:58:59,732 --> 02:59:02,936
[SPEAKER_24]: April 23-447, November 9, 2023.

2079
02:59:03,816 --> 02:59:19,213
[SPEAKER_24]: To the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, Medford City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, Car Park Phase II Grant Resolution, dear President Morrell, and members of the City Council, I am excited to share that the City has been awarded a $1 million Land and Water Conservation Fund grant.

2080
02:59:19,233 --> 02:59:20,955
[SPEAKER_24]: You're going to?

2081
02:59:21,876 --> 02:59:22,036
Okay.

2082
02:59:23,331 --> 02:59:33,616
[SPEAKER_24]: For Phase 2 of the carpark renovation, the City has also been awarded $1.5 million in federal earmarked funding through the Department of Energy, with the support of Representative Clark.

2083
02:59:34,236 --> 02:59:38,558
[SPEAKER_24]: Carpark Phase 2 consists of two subportions, deemed Phase 2a and Phase 2b.

2084
02:59:38,838 --> 02:59:47,302
[SPEAKER_24]: The total cost of Phase 2a is $2,015,000 and was proposed to be funded by the LWCF grant and ARPA funding.

2085
02:59:48,340 --> 02:59:55,787
[SPEAKER_24]: The LWCF grant requires that the City Council pass a resolution accepting the grant and acknowledging the dedication of the property as parkland.

2086
02:59:56,367 --> 03:00:01,232
[SPEAKER_24]: The grant also requires that the full funding for projects be appropriated upon acceptance of the grant.

2087
03:00:01,592 --> 03:00:04,295
[SPEAKER_24]: The enclosed drafted resolution addresses these requirements.

2088
03:00:04,415 --> 03:00:08,358
[SPEAKER_24]: The grant will then reimburse a $1 million portion of the appropriation.

2089
03:00:09,285 --> 03:00:12,249
[SPEAKER_24]: Phase 2B of the project has a total cost of $3 million.

2090
03:00:12,609 --> 03:00:16,574
[SPEAKER_24]: The federal earmarked funding requires a one-to-one match of non-federal funding to the award.

2091
03:00:17,195 --> 03:00:22,422
[SPEAKER_24]: Please note that LWCF is a federal grant program administered through the state and therefore cannot be used to match funds.

2092
03:00:23,915 --> 03:00:29,979
[SPEAKER_24]: I respect the request and recommend that Phase 2B be funded with $1,385,000 in ARPA funds.

2093
03:00:30,459 --> 03:00:39,966
[SPEAKER_24]: The City, spearheaded by Planning, Development and Sustainability, is exploring additional funding sources to complete the $115,000 deficit in funding.

2094
03:00:40,626 --> 03:00:45,870
[SPEAKER_24]: There is significant community support for open space and recreation in Medford and the City's commitment to accessibility.

2095
03:00:48,060 --> 03:00:55,669
[SPEAKER_24]: Broad community outreach has been performed to create inclusive, comprehensive vision for Carr Park, and there is a strong community passion and investment in the completion of this project.

2096
03:00:56,338 --> 03:01:07,848
[SPEAKER_24]: In summary, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body adopt the enclosed resolution to accept the grant for phase 2A of the car park renovation and authorize a loan order request of $1 million to the project.

2097
03:01:08,188 --> 03:01:13,693
[SPEAKER_24]: As stated in the resolutions, the LWCF grant will reimburse $1 million on the completion of the project.

2098
03:01:13,773 --> 03:01:20,859
[SPEAKER_24]: In addition, I respectfully request and recommend that the total of $2.4 million in ARPA funding be allocated to phase 2 of the project.

2099
03:01:22,320 --> 03:01:29,724
[SPEAKER_24]: $1,015,000 of which will go towards Phase 2A, and $1,385,000 of which will go towards Phase 2B.

2100
03:01:30,064 --> 03:01:36,927
[SPEAKER_24]: The LWCF grant for Car Park requires that a copy of a certified boat be sent to them by December 1st.

2101
03:01:37,367 --> 03:01:43,050
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope that these requests have been submitted with sufficient time for the Council to review and meet this important deadline.

2102
03:01:44,210 --> 03:01:45,891
[SPEAKER_24]: Sincerely, Brianna Lugo-Kern, Mayor.

2103
03:01:46,851 --> 03:01:47,512
[SPEAKER_24]: Enclosures.

2104
03:01:47,532 --> 03:01:50,113
[SPEAKER_24]: Am I reading this whole thing too?

2105
03:01:51,559 --> 03:01:56,722
[SPEAKER_24]: I appreciate the confidence of my colleagues.

2106
03:01:57,663 --> 03:02:05,247
[SPEAKER_24]: A loan order to appropriate funds for the implementation of phase two of the car park renovation.

2107
03:02:05,287 --> 03:02:07,168
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Councillor Collins.

2108
03:02:07,288 --> 03:02:08,009
[SPEAKER_24]: All those in favour?

2109
03:02:10,630 --> 03:02:11,210
[SPEAKER_24]: All those opposed?

2110
03:02:11,290 --> 03:02:12,191
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passes.

2111
03:02:12,331 --> 03:02:19,334
[SPEAKER_24]: I will defer to Amanda Centrella who definitely wanted to sit here and listen to me read the rest of that at 10 10 p.m.

2112
03:02:19,694 --> 03:02:20,054
[SPEAKER_24]: Amanda.

2113
03:02:20,754 --> 03:02:21,695
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you guys so much.

2114
03:02:21,995 --> 03:02:23,095
[SPEAKER_29]: My name is Amanda Centrella.

2115
03:02:23,215 --> 03:02:26,957
[SPEAKER_29]: I work as a staff planner in the Office of Planning Development and Sustainability.

2116
03:02:27,795 --> 03:02:29,676
[SPEAKER_29]: I help to manage different parks projects.

2117
03:02:30,436 --> 03:02:41,641
[SPEAKER_29]: And as was already sort of outlined in the memo very thoroughly, I'm not sure if it makes sense for me to go back over those breakdowns, and I'm happy to if people have questions.

2118
03:02:42,842 --> 03:02:48,784
[SPEAKER_29]: Essentially, we've been awarded grant funding, and there are certain requirements for receiving that grant funding.

2119
03:02:50,205 --> 03:02:57,048
[SPEAKER_29]: In tandem with that, we're asking for an approval and your consideration for ARPA funds for this phase two project.

2120
03:02:59,479 --> 03:03:03,481
[SPEAKER_29]: Would counselors be interested in hearing what's in phase two as far as scope?

2121
03:03:05,802 --> 03:03:08,924
[SPEAKER_24]: Any counselors want to hear what's in phase two regarding the scope of the project?

2122
03:03:09,184 --> 03:03:10,465
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Collins does.

2123
03:03:10,685 --> 03:03:11,425
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, great.

2124
03:03:11,666 --> 03:03:15,668
[SPEAKER_29]: So phase two has a lot of really interesting things going on.

2125
03:03:16,588 --> 03:03:19,650
[SPEAKER_29]: Complete renovation of the playground, splash pad.

2126
03:03:20,150 --> 03:03:29,913
[SPEAKER_29]: small skate park, two basketball courts, one of which will be covered, sheltered so that play can be extended through rain or if it's really hot out.

2127
03:03:30,073 --> 03:03:34,654
[SPEAKER_29]: And on that roof will be solar panels, which will power other aspects of the park.

2128
03:03:36,654 --> 03:03:39,435
[SPEAKER_29]: We will, what else are the major ones?

2129
03:03:40,776 --> 03:03:49,578
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a teen area with swings and obstacle course fitness equipment that is appropriate for older kids and adults.

2130
03:03:51,190 --> 03:04:17,688
[SPEAKER_29]: Gazebo area that's sheltered again and overlooking the playground space Really the intent of this park is I think to make it a multi-generational space All of these things are our ideas that were brought to us by community members So this vision is imaginative and exciting and ambitious and it was the result of a lot of community feedback That's just

2131
03:04:19,602 --> 03:04:20,202
[SPEAKER_29]: Mr. President?

2132
03:04:20,382 --> 03:04:21,283
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, Councilor Scarpelli.

2133
03:04:22,723 --> 03:04:25,225
[SPEAKER_36]: This is unbelievable.

2134
03:04:25,285 --> 03:04:32,728
[SPEAKER_36]: We're so excited about it, it's our neighborhood, and the only thing, I told my 20-year-old, John, I'll take you to the park.

2135
03:04:35,192 --> 03:04:37,093
[SPEAKER_36]: So I mean, everything about it is amazing.

2136
03:04:37,113 --> 03:04:39,034
[SPEAKER_36]: I think that, I'm sure, Ms.

2137
03:04:39,534 --> 03:04:47,837
[SPEAKER_36]: Hunt, this is one of the reasons, I got about 15 phone calls from the Butters that it's a really big dog-friendly neighborhood.

2138
03:04:48,557 --> 03:04:53,799
[SPEAKER_36]: And they're confused that they didn't know about the process fully.

2139
03:04:54,559 --> 03:04:58,921
[SPEAKER_36]: So this is what, and they wanted to come here tonight.

2140
03:04:59,181 --> 03:05:00,942
[SPEAKER_36]: And I said, well, this isn't about,

2141
03:05:02,342 --> 03:05:03,123
[SPEAKER_36]: that process.

2142
03:05:03,723 --> 03:05:16,809
[SPEAKER_36]: So I don't know if there's something we can do to talk with them, set up a separate meeting with these folks that so they can understand the process that you, it was, I believe that the question was, could you do separate areas and construction?

2143
03:05:16,849 --> 03:05:17,729
[SPEAKER_36]: I don't see that happening.

2144
03:05:17,770 --> 03:05:28,054
[SPEAKER_36]: So from what I've been told, so I don't, but I think if that, other than that, I don't think anybody in this country is looking at that, what we're doing up there.

2145
03:05:29,075 --> 03:05:29,215
[SPEAKER_36]: It's,

2146
03:05:30,385 --> 03:05:32,086
[SPEAKER_36]: it's really bringing people back up the hill.

2147
03:05:32,306 --> 03:05:54,163
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, it, you know, when you talk about, you know, it's, it's re re re energizing so many different groups, you know, you have the baseball people that are saying, wow, you have, you know, you have new ball fields, we have multi purpose, we have, you know, you know, special needs, you have adults saying that looking for that apparatus park, I mean, this is something that

2148
03:05:54,643 --> 03:05:57,485
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, I'm excited to say we're far ahead of Somerville.

2149
03:05:58,026 --> 03:05:59,847
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, because this is what I do in Somerville.

2150
03:06:00,287 --> 03:06:02,088
[SPEAKER_36]: The people are begging for this in Somerville.

2151
03:06:02,469 --> 03:06:03,910
[SPEAKER_36]: So this is in planning stage.

2152
03:06:04,330 --> 03:06:06,612
[SPEAKER_36]: So I'm so excited that we're seeing this.

2153
03:06:06,652 --> 03:06:11,775
[SPEAKER_36]: So I, you know, and I understand the process we have to go through, the funding mechanism.

2154
03:06:12,175 --> 03:06:14,937
[SPEAKER_36]: It's nice to see ARPA money being used this way.

2155
03:06:16,358 --> 03:06:19,901
[SPEAKER_36]: It's exactly what, you know, you want it to be used for.

2156
03:06:20,001 --> 03:06:21,922
[SPEAKER_36]: So I would move approval.

2157
03:06:23,802 --> 03:06:28,805
[SPEAKER_36]: Mr. President, you're gonna get a lot of that.

2158
03:06:28,925 --> 03:06:30,546
[SPEAKER_36]: The next two years, Madam President.

2159
03:06:31,287 --> 03:06:40,833
[SPEAKER_24]: It'll be a constant reminder of what we're missing.

2160
03:06:40,853 --> 03:06:42,794
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, approval for first reading on the loan order.

2161
03:06:42,814 --> 03:06:43,634
[SPEAKER_24]: Right, first reading.

2162
03:06:43,674 --> 03:06:44,615
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Scarpelli.

2163
03:06:47,397 --> 03:06:48,417
[SPEAKER_24]: I do have a question about that.

2164
03:06:48,497 --> 03:06:49,778
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe to Director Hunt.

2165
03:06:50,599 --> 03:06:52,040
[SPEAKER_24]: They want a response by December 1st.

2166
03:06:55,144 --> 03:06:57,086
[SPEAKER_15]: So, right.

2167
03:06:57,486 --> 03:07:06,253
[SPEAKER_15]: We were thinking, so the part that needs to be approved is, sorry, on your computer, my computer, exactly.

2168
03:07:06,353 --> 03:07:10,376
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the, I keep referring to it as the whereases.

2169
03:07:10,576 --> 03:07:11,957
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, I should speak into the mic.

2170
03:07:12,037 --> 03:07:13,218
[SPEAKER_15]: I know this, sorry it's late.

2171
03:07:13,978 --> 03:07:21,024
[SPEAKER_15]: The part that needs approval that the state needs to know you voted on is the whereases section.

2172
03:07:21,044 --> 03:07:21,664
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a loan order.

2173
03:07:23,330 --> 03:07:29,372
[SPEAKER_15]: And that, I guess, includes, technically, a loan order, which we hadn't been thinking of needing three readings.

2174
03:07:29,392 --> 03:07:34,114
[SPEAKER_24]: We treat loan orders, and bond counsel has requested that we treat loan orders as ordinances.

2175
03:07:35,475 --> 03:07:37,475
[SPEAKER_24]: We could waive the readings.

2176
03:07:37,695 --> 03:07:40,276
[SPEAKER_15]: I will say that bond counsel has reviewed this.

2177
03:07:45,378 --> 03:07:46,219
[SPEAKER_24]: Which one was that?

2178
03:07:47,159 --> 03:07:48,880
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

2179
03:07:53,370 --> 03:07:55,792
[SPEAKER_15]: Mike, can we, I don't know what the timing is.

2180
03:07:55,852 --> 03:08:08,162
[SPEAKER_15]: So I will tell you that my office has started advertising in the Boston Herald because we could not, we've run out of, it's too difficult to work with Wicked Local between the timelines and their billing department.

2181
03:08:08,582 --> 03:08:18,090
[SPEAKER_15]: We've actually kind of given up and we've started advertising in the Herald, which really speeds up our turnaround times on advertising of items.

2182
03:08:18,170 --> 03:08:21,393
[SPEAKER_15]: But I didn't realize that you would need to advertise it in the,

2183
03:08:22,322 --> 03:08:31,837
[SPEAKER_24]: But I can, so if we could, we'd have to advertise it in time to take it up for third reading on the 28th for you to get on the 28th and we would

2184
03:08:32,450 --> 03:08:42,392
[SPEAKER_15]: We would ask if it could then the legal paper be certified by the clerk's office the next day and not wait till the minutes are approved by the council.

2185
03:08:43,512 --> 03:08:47,173
[SPEAKER_38]: In terms of the certification of vote, that can get done.

2186
03:08:47,713 --> 03:08:55,695
[SPEAKER_38]: The concern here is the advertising because you're right, if we use Wicked Local, we're not going to be able to have an advertising time to have third reading on the 28th.

2187
03:08:57,495 --> 03:09:00,820
[SPEAKER_38]: we'll figure out how to advertise it so we can get advertised in the Herald.

2188
03:09:02,042 --> 03:09:07,951
[SPEAKER_38]: And in terms of certifying the vote, that can get done no problem at all.

2189
03:09:08,372 --> 03:09:10,835
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I think though, in terms of signing

2190
03:09:12,488 --> 03:09:24,351
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we should check in offline and make sure, because we don't have a solicitor, we've been mailing things to KP Law to sign on behalf of the city solicitor, which is obviously something we would not like to be doing, but it's where we are at.

2191
03:09:25,571 --> 03:09:30,332
[SPEAKER_24]: So if we need their signature on a piece of paper, we don't.

2192
03:09:30,692 --> 03:09:31,012
[SPEAKER_24]: We won't?

2193
03:09:31,473 --> 03:09:32,653
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we, okay.

2194
03:09:32,793 --> 03:09:33,633
[SPEAKER_24]: I feel good about that.

2195
03:09:33,673 --> 03:09:40,695
[SPEAKER_24]: I think we should double check in on it just to make sure that we don't need someone from KP Law to sign this, but that's two weeks away, so.

2196
03:09:46,025 --> 03:09:52,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, we have had this reviewed by bond counsel and KP law before it was on your agenda.

2197
03:09:52,209 --> 03:09:54,911
[SPEAKER_24]: They're just literally signing ordinances as city solicitor.

2198
03:09:54,931 --> 03:09:55,031
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

2199
03:09:55,892 --> 03:10:00,255
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's just it's a part of the formal process to have on that brief paper.

2200
03:10:02,742 --> 03:10:03,102
[SPEAKER_38]: Yeah.

2201
03:10:03,202 --> 03:10:06,344
[SPEAKER_38]: They won't need it to go on the green paper, because the green paper is the last step.

2202
03:10:06,925 --> 03:10:14,910
[SPEAKER_38]: As long as the mayor has approved the ordinance, after the council approves it for third reading and then the mayor approves it, it would then go on to the green paper.

2203
03:10:14,930 --> 03:10:18,072
[SPEAKER_38]: So it would still be an ordinance once the mayor signs it.

2204
03:10:19,353 --> 03:10:19,493
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

2205
03:10:19,513 --> 03:10:24,696
[SPEAKER_24]: So I have a motion from Councillor Scarpelli to approve for first reading, seconded by Councillor Collins.

2206
03:10:25,237 --> 03:10:26,798
[SPEAKER_24]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2207
03:10:35,393 --> 03:10:40,075
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2208
03:10:40,875 --> 03:10:42,576
[SPEAKER_39]: Yes.

2209
03:10:44,176 --> 03:10:44,437
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2210
03:10:44,477 --> 03:10:45,757
[SPEAKER_24]: Six in the affirmative.

2211
03:10:46,237 --> 03:10:49,839
[SPEAKER_24]: None of the negative one absent motion is approved for first reading.

2212
03:10:49,859 --> 03:10:51,319
[SPEAKER_39]: Thank you.

2213
03:10:51,619 --> 03:10:53,480
[SPEAKER_24]: I will turn it back over to the president.

2214
03:10:55,821 --> 03:10:56,241
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2215
03:10:56,581 --> 03:10:57,221
[SPEAKER_15]: And good evening.

2216
03:10:57,241 --> 03:10:58,442
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to leave now.

2217
03:11:08,560 --> 03:11:12,302
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, I think we're under suspension.

2218
03:11:12,322 --> 03:11:13,843
[SPEAKER_42]: Do I have a motion to revert?

2219
03:11:14,744 --> 03:11:19,506
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion of Councilor Scarpelli to revert back to regular order of business, seconded by Councilor Sang.

2220
03:11:19,526 --> 03:11:20,247
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

2221
03:11:20,267 --> 03:11:21,348
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

2222
03:11:21,388 --> 03:11:22,228
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

2223
03:11:22,868 --> 03:11:26,651
[SPEAKER_42]: Find book page 18.

2224
03:11:28,432 --> 03:11:29,592
[SPEAKER_42]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

2225
03:11:29,612 --> 03:11:31,974
[SPEAKER_42]: 23-449 offered by Councilor Collins.

2226
03:11:32,034 --> 03:11:36,376
[SPEAKER_42]: Be it resolved that the subcommittee on ordinances and rules meet to consider a wildlife feeding ordinance.

2227
03:11:36,436 --> 03:11:37,117
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Collins.

2228
03:11:37,576 --> 03:11:38,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Morrell.

2229
03:11:38,436 --> 03:11:50,122
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm bringing this forward after some back and forth with residents who are concerned about excessive wildlife feeding that they've been noticing in their neighborhood that they've been unable to resolve through neighbor outreach alone.

2230
03:11:52,283 --> 03:12:04,029
[SPEAKER_16]: This proposal would be simply in the interest of curbing excessive or inappropriate wildlife feeding, not talking about rural bird feeders, not trying to steal anybody's joy, in residential areas in the interest of keeping homes

2231
03:12:04,797 --> 03:12:11,222
[SPEAKER_16]: and porches and yards free from animal traffic, food, waste, detritus, harms to peace and health.

2232
03:12:12,563 --> 03:12:23,591
[SPEAKER_16]: There are some nearby communities to ours that have passed similar ordinances just in order to enable code enforcement to intervene around this when necessary that we can look to as a jumping off point.

2233
03:12:24,532 --> 03:12:28,115
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would motion to approve and send a subcommittee.

2234
03:12:29,385 --> 03:12:30,125
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2235
03:12:31,606 --> 03:12:35,829
[SPEAKER_42]: So on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Carvajal, all those in favor?

2236
03:12:35,929 --> 03:12:36,989
[SPEAKER_42]: Opposed?

2237
03:12:37,010 --> 03:12:38,010
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passed.

2238
03:12:38,070 --> 03:12:40,051
[SPEAKER_42]: I don't know.

2239
03:12:40,071 --> 03:12:44,594
[SPEAKER_42]: Subcommittee on ordinances and rules.

2240
03:12:44,614 --> 03:12:47,696
[SPEAKER_42]: You're just the easiest person to look at.

2241
03:12:53,554 --> 03:12:57,077
[SPEAKER_42]: All right, 23-452 offered by Councilor Collins, Councilor Sang, and President Morrell.

2242
03:12:57,097 --> 03:13:13,591
[SPEAKER_42]: Be it resolved that Metro City Council recognize Transgender Day of Remembrance on November 20th, 2023, and commit to remembering all those lost to anti-trans violence, honoring all those affected by anti-trans violence, bigotry, standing with our transgender community members, and reaffirming their right to thrive and live authentically.

2243
03:13:13,691 --> 03:13:14,432
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Collins.

2244
03:13:15,413 --> 03:13:19,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Morrell, and thank you to yourself and Councilor Sang for joining with me on this resolution.

2245
03:13:20,913 --> 03:13:23,835
[SPEAKER_16]: Transgender Day of Remembrance is observed on November 20th.

2246
03:13:24,535 --> 03:13:36,462
[SPEAKER_16]: This is the day to think about and remember those who have tragically lost their lives due to hatred and bigotry and violence simply for being who they are.

2247
03:13:36,482 --> 03:13:48,568
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's a day to contemplate those who paved the way for others in the trans and greater LGBTQ plus community to be able to live their authentic lives and thrive in our community.

2248
03:13:50,367 --> 03:13:53,268
[SPEAKER_16]: against the history of hardship, enduring hardship.

2249
03:13:54,229 --> 03:14:08,294
[SPEAKER_16]: So I appreciate this opportunity to reaffirm our solidarity with the trans community and to have a moment to contemplate sacrifices and tragedies that have come before us and the work ahead to a fully equitable and safe society for all.

2250
03:14:08,634 --> 03:14:08,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2251
03:14:11,431 --> 03:14:18,335
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councillor Collins, for initiating this, and thank you to my fellow co-sponsors on this.

2252
03:14:18,615 --> 03:14:32,903
[SPEAKER_22]: This is something that is really important to me personally, as someone who's grown up with a lot of transgender friends who've been bullied and attacked on the streets, not in Medford, but in general.

2253
03:14:33,103 --> 03:14:38,746
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, it's important, I think, to really shed light, bring attention to this, because everyone deserves to live in dignity.

2254
03:14:40,527 --> 03:14:59,491
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think it's also particularly important to acknowledge the intersectionality of transgender violence in our country as well, especially the higher rates at which Black transgender folks and Indigenous transgender folks face violence and bigotry in public.

2255
03:14:59,711 --> 03:15:02,832
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I'm really grateful for the Council for taking this up.

2256
03:15:04,112 --> 03:15:09,293
[SPEAKER_22]: And there's still so much more work to do, but I'm very proud to be a co-sponsor of this one.

2257
03:15:10,035 --> 03:15:13,399
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Councilor Sangh, and thank you to you and Councilor Collins for sponsoring this with me.

2258
03:15:14,220 --> 03:15:22,351
[SPEAKER_42]: The Transgender Day of Remembrance came after the result of the murders of two black transgender women in Alston and Watertown, so very close.

2259
03:15:24,675 --> 03:15:26,356
[SPEAKER_42]: I mean, it just speaks to it being in our backyard.

2260
03:15:26,416 --> 03:15:32,718
[SPEAKER_42]: Sometimes I think we think living in an area like this, it's not something that's faced by the community, but of course it is.

2261
03:15:33,319 --> 03:15:37,580
[SPEAKER_42]: And I think that Councillor Stang's point, this really highlights the intersectionality of the issue.

2262
03:15:37,821 --> 03:15:40,322
[SPEAKER_42]: And I think it's important this year, it's important every year.

2263
03:15:41,102 --> 03:15:48,145
[SPEAKER_42]: But as you know, we have record-breaking numbers of transgender, anti-transgender legislation being presented across the country.

2264
03:15:48,699 --> 03:16:01,525
[SPEAKER_42]: That has very real impacts because of the legislation, but because it further others this community and lets people look at them as different and people that they should not treat with the dignity and respect they deserve like the rest of us.

2265
03:16:01,545 --> 03:16:08,468
[SPEAKER_42]: So if in small part we can bring this forward from the city council, say we remember, say this is important, that I'm glad we can do that.

2266
03:16:10,805 --> 03:16:11,245
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Beres.

2267
03:16:11,305 --> 03:16:11,846
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice-Chancellor Beres.

2268
03:16:12,146 --> 03:16:13,186
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

2269
03:16:13,226 --> 03:16:15,588
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to thank my colleagues for putting this on the agenda.

2270
03:16:17,289 --> 03:16:19,110
[SPEAKER_24]: And just echo all the comments that have been made.

2271
03:16:19,970 --> 03:16:36,560
[SPEAKER_24]: I know a lot of my trans friends are feeling very afraid in this environment, in this country, where we see all this active and successful legislation, never mind the media campaigns and just the general

2272
03:16:37,440 --> 03:16:44,504
[SPEAKER_24]: what I would deem to be relatively violent things that are said on a regular basis about transgender people.

2273
03:16:45,284 --> 03:16:58,211
[SPEAKER_24]: And I just think it's important that when we see things like that, when we see the so much evidence of those things happening right here nearby, that we speak up and say that it's not right.

2274
03:16:58,431 --> 03:17:00,972
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you for putting these on and I'm happy to support this.

2275
03:17:03,172 --> 03:17:07,035
[SPEAKER_42]: So on the motion of Councilor Collins is seconded by Councilor Sang.

2276
03:17:07,075 --> 03:17:07,756
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

2277
03:17:08,356 --> 03:17:08,977
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

2278
03:17:09,017 --> 03:17:11,319
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

2279
03:17:11,339 --> 03:17:20,406
[SPEAKER_42]: 23-453 offered by Councilor Collins and Vice Chair Behrs, be it resolved that the subcommittee on ordinances and rules need to consider an ordinance to regulate the retail sales of animals raised in commercial breeding facilities.

2280
03:17:20,806 --> 03:17:21,667
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Collins.

2281
03:17:23,769 --> 03:17:24,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Morrell.

2282
03:17:25,449 --> 03:17:47,161
[SPEAKER_16]: This proposal was brought forward by a constituent who's been active in local efforts to ensure that commercial sales of pets and pet shops is done in a humane way, is kind of observing best practices around making sure that commercial pet stores in our communities are not

2283
03:17:48,694 --> 03:17:54,398
[SPEAKER_16]: promoting or participating in inhumane raising and selling of pets.

2284
03:17:54,878 --> 03:18:04,905
[SPEAKER_16]: So this would be an ordinance project to look at what nearby communities are doing to try to take local action to make sure that is the case and to see what might make sense to tailor for Medford.

2285
03:18:06,426 --> 03:18:06,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2286
03:18:07,227 --> 03:18:07,707
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice Mayor Barras.

2287
03:18:08,248 --> 03:18:09,168
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

2288
03:18:09,188 --> 03:18:10,009
[SPEAKER_24]: I think this is a

2289
03:18:10,843 --> 03:18:21,634
[SPEAKER_24]: Another term that you commonly hear used that this is trying to address is the puppy bills issue, where you have a very inhumane conditions of breeding of dogs for commercial sale.

2290
03:18:22,415 --> 03:18:28,481
[SPEAKER_24]: And just to make sure that our community and the businesses in our community, although I'm sure that.

2291
03:18:29,162 --> 03:18:37,006
[SPEAKER_24]: folks are doing their due diligence that we haven't on the record, that they are not in any way participating in those kind of puppy mill supply chains.

2292
03:18:37,206 --> 03:18:40,168
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you for co-sponsoring this and leading on this.

2293
03:18:40,268 --> 03:18:40,868
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Collins.

2294
03:18:42,409 --> 03:18:45,591
[SPEAKER_42]: So on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

2295
03:18:46,291 --> 03:18:46,992
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

2296
03:18:47,312 --> 03:18:47,432
[SPEAKER_43]: Aye.

2297
03:18:47,772 --> 03:18:48,573
[SPEAKER_42]: All those opposed?

2298
03:18:48,653 --> 03:18:49,873
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes.

2299
03:18:49,913 --> 03:18:56,217
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Collins, we do have a item under suspension as well.

2300
03:18:56,417 --> 03:18:56,597
What?

2301
03:18:57,217 --> 03:18:58,198
[SPEAKER_24]: Stretch code for third reading.

2302
03:18:59,294 --> 03:19:00,915
[SPEAKER_42]: Let's take a look.

2303
03:19:03,657 --> 03:19:04,558
[SPEAKER_36]: We lost zero.

2304
03:19:06,559 --> 03:19:12,063
[SPEAKER_36]: This past week we lost a member of our teaching community at Bedford High School.

2305
03:19:12,523 --> 03:19:18,907
[SPEAKER_36]: We lost John Lazaro, a former colleague and friend.

2306
03:19:21,493 --> 03:19:37,682
[SPEAKER_36]: John's had a tough last couple of years, but no matter what he went through physically, he still found his way to his classroom and to support his chemistry students and his science students from high school.

2307
03:19:38,942 --> 03:19:45,586
[SPEAKER_36]: Great demeanor, he always had a sense of responsibility

2308
03:19:46,457 --> 03:19:48,978
[SPEAKER_36]: you know, confidence that only John had.

2309
03:19:49,279 --> 03:19:55,622
[SPEAKER_36]: And, you know, we went through a lot of beginnings when we first started together as teachers.

2310
03:19:55,742 --> 03:20:00,304
[SPEAKER_36]: So I know his wife, Kay, is one of the best people in the world.

2311
03:20:00,404 --> 03:20:06,007
[SPEAKER_36]: And they raised two amazing children, John and Elizabeth.

2312
03:20:06,067 --> 03:20:08,309
[SPEAKER_36]: I know my son, John, went to school with Elizabeth and

2313
03:20:09,694 --> 03:20:12,235
[SPEAKER_36]: It's definitely, you can feel the void in our community.

2314
03:20:12,315 --> 03:20:17,138
[SPEAKER_36]: He also had a brother, Phillip, and his brother, Mike, who's also a custodian at the high school.

2315
03:20:18,658 --> 03:20:20,919
[SPEAKER_36]: So I know that he'll be laid to rest tomorrow.

2316
03:20:22,060 --> 03:20:24,901
[SPEAKER_36]: I hope that we can get word to the school department.

2317
03:20:25,181 --> 03:20:31,124
[SPEAKER_36]: I hope that they'll be lowering the flag at half-mast in his honor, because he deserves that.

2318
03:20:33,465 --> 03:20:37,808
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, to John's family, we feel your loss.

2319
03:20:38,188 --> 03:20:42,131
[SPEAKER_36]: We'll never feel the pain that they do, but he'll be missed for sure.

2320
03:20:42,251 --> 03:20:43,272
[SPEAKER_36]: So thank you, Madam President.

2321
03:20:43,572 --> 03:20:43,852
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2322
03:20:45,932 --> 03:20:46,333
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2323
03:20:46,353 --> 03:20:51,717
[SPEAKER_22]: I just wanted to send my deepest condolences and sympathies to his family.

2324
03:20:51,737 --> 03:20:57,301
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm grateful for Councillor Scarpelli for introducing this.

2325
03:20:58,022 --> 03:21:06,068
[SPEAKER_22]: I was one of his students and I've been reflecting over the weekend about that year in chemistry and how much fun it was.

2326
03:21:06,929 --> 03:21:14,395
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think that's something that will stay in my NHS experience forever when I think about my time there.

2327
03:21:15,215 --> 03:21:23,258
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, Mr. Lozaro would tell, he would tell so many stories, and he was so proud of his family.

2328
03:21:23,458 --> 03:21:27,019
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, in every story that he told, there was wisdom.

2329
03:21:27,139 --> 03:21:30,360
[SPEAKER_22]: There was, you know, these nuggets of wisdom that we really valued.

2330
03:21:30,660 --> 03:21:37,823
[SPEAKER_22]: And, you know, we laughed about the stories, but we also talk about, you know, what we learned from those stories in his life.

2331
03:21:38,443 --> 03:21:42,225
[SPEAKER_22]: He also had the funniest, the wittiest one-liners and comebacks.

2332
03:21:43,706 --> 03:21:54,311
[SPEAKER_22]: So funny, in fact, and actually so wise, in fact, that we started this Google Doc of quotes of what he would say as a teacher.

2333
03:21:54,912 --> 03:22:03,016
[SPEAKER_22]: And this doc became so legendary that I checked it yesterday, and people were still adding to it last year.

2334
03:22:03,636 --> 03:22:12,262
[SPEAKER_22]: And I had the opportunity to stop by his wake before this and to talk to Kay and the rest of his family.

2335
03:22:12,322 --> 03:22:15,524
[SPEAKER_22]: And we joked around a little bit about the document and about his wit.

2336
03:22:16,024 --> 03:22:21,567
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's something that I felt like will be part of his students forever, that experience.

2337
03:22:22,548 --> 03:22:26,450
[SPEAKER_22]: We really did love him, and I'll miss him really well.

2338
03:22:28,852 --> 03:22:29,572
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you, Councilor Sang.

2339
03:22:29,893 --> 03:22:30,813
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Carvio.

2340
03:22:30,873 --> 03:22:31,654
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam President.

2341
03:22:32,504 --> 03:22:39,005
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I knew the Lazaro family personally, and I was shocked when I found out about it.

2342
03:22:40,366 --> 03:22:49,147
[SPEAKER_21]: I knew he was struggling over the last couple of years, but didn't think that he was in that kind of condition.

2343
03:22:49,247 --> 03:22:54,929
[SPEAKER_21]: And, you know, he's been a good teacher and a mentor to a lot of students at the high school.

2344
03:22:54,989 --> 03:23:00,490
[SPEAKER_21]: And like Counselor Scott says, you know, lifelong family.

2345
03:23:02,667 --> 03:23:03,788
[SPEAKER_21]: They're going to be missing the community.

2346
03:23:05,750 --> 03:23:06,811
[SPEAKER_24]: My condolences go out to the family.

2347
03:23:07,391 --> 03:23:07,611
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2348
03:23:07,731 --> 03:23:08,332
[SPEAKER_42]: Vice President Farris.

2349
03:23:09,113 --> 03:23:09,953
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

2350
03:23:10,114 --> 03:23:21,884
[SPEAKER_24]: I appear and I'm apparently one of the few people who made it all the way through Bedford High School without having him as a teacher and without having a really much direct experience with him at all.

2351
03:23:22,604 --> 03:23:25,367
[SPEAKER_24]: And the amount of communication that I've gotten

2352
03:23:25,900 --> 03:23:28,421
[SPEAKER_24]: from folks in the community saying, did you hear this news?

2353
03:23:29,882 --> 03:23:47,670
[SPEAKER_24]: And the stories that I've heard and the stories that folks have shared, I think that's a testament to the fact that even though I only knew about Mr. Lazaro through the stories of others, that I knew so much about him and that people contacted me in such a big way.

2354
03:23:47,731 --> 03:23:50,352
[SPEAKER_24]: So my condolences are with the family,

2355
03:23:51,392 --> 03:24:02,359
[SPEAKER_24]: the generations of students that he educated who are thinking about him and also celebrating the great moments that they had with him as well.

2356
03:24:02,899 --> 03:24:10,543
[SPEAKER_24]: And I've had a small part in that over these past few days that it was entirely unearned, and I'm grateful for it.

2357
03:24:11,024 --> 03:24:11,344
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

2358
03:24:12,285 --> 03:24:12,825
[SPEAKER_42]: Professor Collins.

2359
03:24:14,046 --> 03:24:14,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2360
03:24:15,106 --> 03:24:15,907
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Morrell.

2361
03:24:17,288 --> 03:24:19,649
[SPEAKER_16]: I famously was not in Medford for high school,

2362
03:24:20,197 --> 03:24:31,159
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, I think we can all relate to having that one or two special teachers that stay with us for, you know, as students that stay with us for our entire lives, that are mentors, leave such a big impression that we never forget about.

2363
03:24:31,219 --> 03:24:39,361
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's clear from what I've been hearing from friends about Mr. Lazzaro after the past few days that he was that person for just hundreds and hundreds of students.

2364
03:24:39,421 --> 03:24:44,222
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's hard to imagine having a having a greater impact on your community than that.

2365
03:24:44,302 --> 03:24:45,562
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm just thinking of his family.

2366
03:24:45,582 --> 03:24:48,343
[SPEAKER_16]: My heart goes out to them, sending my most sincere condolences and

2367
03:24:49,066 --> 03:24:50,569
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes me wish I had known him.

2368
03:24:51,631 --> 03:24:52,933
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you.

2369
03:24:53,053 --> 03:24:53,434
[SPEAKER_42]: Please rise.

2370
03:25:17,687 --> 03:25:21,429
[SPEAKER_42]: Going to Vice President Behrs, I believe you said, or someone asked about something for.

2371
03:25:22,369 --> 03:25:27,511
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, Madam President, motion to take paper 23-023 off the table and approve for third reading.

2372
03:25:27,531 --> 03:25:33,994
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion to Vice President Behrs to take 23-023 off the table and approve for a third reading.

2373
03:25:37,555 --> 03:25:46,439
[SPEAKER_42]: And this is the stretch code, energy code as presented to the council, developed along with the Office of Planning and Sustainability as well.

2374
03:25:51,732 --> 03:25:55,275
[SPEAKER_24]: This is adopting the state's green building code, yes.

2375
03:25:55,295 --> 03:25:58,737
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2376
03:26:16,112 --> 03:26:19,234
[SPEAKER_36]: Because I own a solar company now.

2377
03:26:19,715 --> 03:26:21,436
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm like the rest of you phonies.

2378
03:26:21,676 --> 03:26:23,798
[SPEAKER_24]: A solar magnate, George Scarpelli.

2379
03:26:26,000 --> 03:26:29,022
[SPEAKER_24]: He wants me to join, but then we wouldn't have anyone to vote on solar.

2380
03:26:30,263 --> 03:26:31,404
[SPEAKER_39]: I'm going to call the roll call.

2381
03:26:32,164 --> 03:26:33,005
[SPEAKER_39]: Vice President Harris.

2382
03:26:33,165 --> 03:26:33,445
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

2383
03:26:33,605 --> 03:26:34,426
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Kermodez.

2384
03:26:34,806 --> 03:26:35,447
[SPEAKER_39]: Councilor Collins.

2385
03:26:44,626 --> 03:26:48,329
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes, five in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent, one recusal.

2386
03:26:48,349 --> 03:26:50,230
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion passes for third reading.

2387
03:26:51,350 --> 03:26:52,671
[SPEAKER_42]: We also, that's the end of our agenda.

2388
03:26:52,731 --> 03:26:55,153
[SPEAKER_42]: Is there anyone, public participation?

2389
03:26:55,653 --> 03:26:56,213
[SPEAKER_42]: Mr. Murphy?

2390
03:26:56,574 --> 03:26:57,254
[SPEAKER_42]: Anyone?

2391
03:26:59,155 --> 03:27:02,377
[SPEAKER_39]: You're kidding.

2392
03:27:02,637 --> 03:27:04,078
[SPEAKER_36]: Why don't you say something?

2393
03:27:04,879 --> 03:27:06,740
[SPEAKER_39]: I told you before the meeting.

2394
03:27:06,760 --> 03:27:07,861
[SPEAKER_35]: I don't listen to you, I apologize.

2395
03:27:13,996 --> 03:27:17,498
[SPEAKER_24]: press the button, because we want to make sure you're heard at the late hour.

2396
03:27:17,538 --> 03:27:17,818
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

2397
03:27:18,919 --> 03:27:20,540
[SPEAKER_25]: Chris Murphy, 15 Cobb Street.

2398
03:27:21,240 --> 03:27:42,612
[SPEAKER_25]: Before I go talk about the piece, I know you guys enjoy my occasional visits, but for the last time, for a couple of you, Cole, Rick, Adam, wherever the hell he is, just thank you guys for all you do, all you have done, and all you will continue to do.

2399
03:27:44,977 --> 03:27:49,358
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, it's not easy as this night could tell.

2400
03:27:50,238 --> 03:28:06,962
[SPEAKER_25]: And then, but Rick, I just wanted to say thank you for always being a friend of the Mexican football and always at every budget season taking the ball of pushing for Hormel Stadium, which I hope one of you will pick up that ball and run with that.

2401
03:28:07,802 --> 03:28:09,363
[SPEAKER_25]: But the reason I am here,

2402
03:28:10,848 --> 03:28:17,396
[SPEAKER_25]: Next week, Method High School football will play for the 136th time against the Malden Golden Tornadoes.

2403
03:28:19,139 --> 03:28:21,822
[SPEAKER_25]: We will be at is a home game for us this year.

2404
03:28:23,024 --> 03:28:25,066
[SPEAKER_25]: After a couple of years, we finally back on the

2405
03:28:27,273 --> 03:28:28,954
[SPEAKER_25]: odd year home, even year away.

2406
03:28:30,155 --> 03:28:40,721
[SPEAKER_25]: But we do have a couple great events coming up this week that I also wanted to come and push this Thursday at four o'clock at McDonald Stadium, which is named after a Meffitt High School alumni.

2407
03:28:41,262 --> 03:28:52,849
[SPEAKER_25]: I always love to throw that in there, that there is a plaque for Tobit McDonald, who was the captain of the 1935 Meffitt High School football team, but they don't like to acknowledge, it's not acknowledged on the plaque.

2408
03:28:54,343 --> 03:28:59,826
[SPEAKER_25]: But at four o'clock, they're going to be doing a unified, our second annual unified flag game.

2409
03:29:02,187 --> 03:29:03,567
[SPEAKER_25]: Last year was an awesome event.

2410
03:29:03,647 --> 03:29:09,590
[SPEAKER_25]: We got the varsity team involved on both sides, and it was just an awesome event.

2411
03:29:09,630 --> 03:29:10,430
[SPEAKER_25]: The news is there.

2412
03:29:10,850 --> 03:29:14,772
[SPEAKER_25]: If you can make it down there at four o'clock, it's a great event.

2413
03:29:15,753 --> 03:29:16,953
[SPEAKER_25]: These kids have a blast.

2414
03:29:17,613 --> 03:29:21,155
[SPEAKER_25]: And then immediately following that, our JV team, a couple

2415
03:29:22,300 --> 03:29:27,245
[SPEAKER_25]: new kind of tradition we've kind of had as our JV team to play each other the week before.

2416
03:29:28,146 --> 03:29:37,916
[SPEAKER_25]: And then next Thursday in the pep rally on Wednesday, I think at 11 o'clock, but 10 o'clock next Thursday.

2417
03:29:37,936 --> 03:29:43,582
[SPEAKER_25]: And I am proud to stand here before you as the booster president of a winning football program.

2418
03:29:46,942 --> 03:29:57,187
[SPEAKER_25]: This year has been the first, I've kind of dubbed it with Coach Curley, the first, I call it the first in a long time type of year.

2419
03:29:57,927 --> 03:30:03,049
[SPEAKER_25]: First time in 16 years, 14 years with five wins.

2420
03:30:03,149 --> 03:30:07,131
[SPEAKER_25]: Longest streak we've had in a long time where we haven't gone under 500 all this season.

2421
03:30:08,392 --> 03:30:13,514
[SPEAKER_25]: We've only let up an average of 16 points a game this year, which is the best we've had in a long time.

2422
03:30:16,440 --> 03:30:27,109
[SPEAKER_25]: And all that with, you know, 42 great young men and women who would, you know, play hard, play tough, and an amazing coaching staff.

2423
03:30:27,149 --> 03:30:35,236
[SPEAKER_25]: And we're finally, something that George and I have pushed for the last couple years, we're finally seeing the John Curley effect where, you know,

2424
03:30:37,450 --> 03:30:39,631
[SPEAKER_25]: attitude of these kids has changed and it's showing.

2425
03:30:39,851 --> 03:30:42,213
[SPEAKER_25]: And believe it or not, we have a very young team too.

2426
03:30:42,233 --> 03:30:44,774
[SPEAKER_25]: We don't have, we are going to return a lot of starters.

2427
03:30:44,814 --> 03:30:49,757
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think you're going to see for years to come a very successful program.

2428
03:30:50,857 --> 03:31:00,382
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, and I can't, like I said, I can't, you know, all those that have been, you know, have helped this team out of the air, you know, just thank you and thank you for giving me this couple of minutes.

2429
03:31:01,563 --> 03:31:02,444
[SPEAKER_42]: I know you're all tired.

2430
03:31:02,464 --> 03:31:03,764
[SPEAKER_42]: Thank you for bearing with us so long.

2431
03:31:04,024 --> 03:31:04,325
[SPEAKER_42]: God bless.

2432
03:31:04,365 --> 03:31:04,625
[SPEAKER_42]: Thanks.

2433
03:31:06,055 --> 03:31:06,636
[SPEAKER_42]: Councilor Perriello.

2434
03:31:06,696 --> 03:31:07,376
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam President.

2435
03:31:07,396 --> 03:31:09,178
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course, thank you for all the work you've done.

2436
03:31:09,758 --> 03:31:17,385
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know my family's commitments for the 50 plus years, the Carabiello family, football in the city of Medford.

2437
03:31:17,965 --> 03:31:21,248
[SPEAKER_21]: Glad to see the program is turning around and going on the right track again.

2438
03:31:21,908 --> 03:31:23,470
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you to you for all the work that you do.

2439
03:31:23,890 --> 03:31:25,011
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2440
03:31:25,051 --> 03:31:32,037
[SPEAKER_21]: To keep, I don't think people understand the work that goes into getting these kids fed, helping to raise money for the uniforms and all the programs they do.

2441
03:31:32,560 --> 03:31:32,980
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2442
03:31:33,221 --> 03:31:33,661
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2443
03:31:33,701 --> 03:31:35,822
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Coach, for getting us back on track.

2444
03:31:37,483 --> 03:31:47,910
[SPEAKER_36]: If I can, Madam President, I know that one thing that I need to mention again is the commitment of the football program to the community.

2445
03:31:47,970 --> 03:31:52,713
[SPEAKER_36]: I think that shines brighter than any win we've ever had.

2446
03:31:52,993 --> 03:31:54,314
[SPEAKER_36]: And I think that's what's important.

2447
03:31:54,694 --> 03:31:56,916
[SPEAKER_36]: Their commitment to the community and volunteering.

2448
03:31:57,416 --> 03:31:58,617
[SPEAKER_36]: I think it's it

2449
03:31:59,360 --> 03:32:02,023
[SPEAKER_36]: They don't have to win a game for what they do with the community.

2450
03:32:02,063 --> 03:32:03,885
[SPEAKER_36]: So I applaud you guys for doing that.

2451
03:32:03,945 --> 03:32:06,989
[SPEAKER_36]: But I think that coach Curley has to take a lot of credit.

2452
03:32:07,029 --> 03:32:08,631
[SPEAKER_36]: But I also have done this.

2453
03:32:08,791 --> 03:32:15,599
[SPEAKER_36]: People have to understand if you didn't live in Medford, if you didn't go to Medford High School, if you didn't play a sport.

2454
03:32:16,430 --> 03:32:32,025
[SPEAKER_36]: If you didn't have the luck of having Steve Miller as your equipment manager at Medford High or live in that era, you truly don't understand what it means to be a true Mustang.

2455
03:32:32,545 --> 03:32:39,332
[SPEAKER_36]: I mean, you know, Bud Kelly, he coined the term blue and white flowing through your veins and legitimately,

2456
03:32:41,574 --> 03:32:45,817
[SPEAKER_36]: I, my freshman year, I wanted to cut myself just to see if I was, is it true?

2457
03:32:45,877 --> 03:32:47,539
[SPEAKER_36]: Because that's how much it would convince you.

2458
03:32:47,559 --> 03:32:48,219
[SPEAKER_36]: But I will tell you.

2459
03:32:48,459 --> 03:32:52,863
[SPEAKER_25]: Buddy once told me that you can only see it if you're in the room with an actual Mustang.

2460
03:32:52,883 --> 03:32:56,206
[SPEAKER_25]: So if you cut yourself and you see red, the other guy in the room is not a real Mustang.

2461
03:32:56,226 --> 03:32:57,567
[SPEAKER_36]: Don't do that.

2462
03:32:57,867 --> 03:33:00,389
[SPEAKER_36]: If you come to the game next Thursday, you can buy.

2463
03:33:05,453 --> 03:33:07,174
[SPEAKER_36]: And I believe blue and white t-shirt.

2464
03:33:08,295 --> 03:33:18,181
[SPEAKER_36]: I do believe blue and white, but I will tell you my point to saying this is that it's very different because when you hear some people say it, you know, Mustang pride, you know, there's some clowns that do do it.

2465
03:33:18,761 --> 03:33:20,903
[SPEAKER_36]: And that's just a word for them.

2466
03:33:21,803 --> 03:33:26,286
[SPEAKER_36]: But we appreciate you, Chris, because I think you keep that alive.

2467
03:33:26,706 --> 03:33:30,149
[SPEAKER_36]: And and I think that's what you're seeing the change with these kids.

2468
03:33:30,509 --> 03:33:31,830
[SPEAKER_36]: It's not just John Curley.

2469
03:33:32,170 --> 03:33:32,290
[SPEAKER_36]: It's

2470
03:33:32,870 --> 03:33:38,493
[SPEAKER_36]: Chris Murphy's energy to say, hey, listen, being a Method Mustang is part of life.

2471
03:33:38,653 --> 03:33:39,494
[SPEAKER_36]: And you know what?

2472
03:33:40,054 --> 03:33:41,735
[SPEAKER_36]: We're Method Mustangs behind this reel.

2473
03:33:41,975 --> 03:33:43,776
[SPEAKER_36]: It's like, you feel like part of the team.

2474
03:33:43,816 --> 03:33:46,398
[SPEAKER_36]: And that's what I think our whole community is lacking right now.

2475
03:33:46,838 --> 03:33:48,859
[SPEAKER_36]: We're forgetting that we're all Mustangs.

2476
03:33:49,880 --> 03:33:58,105
[SPEAKER_36]: And maybe if people lived like that a little bit more and understood that to be true, I think that it would stop a lot of animosity in our community.

2477
03:33:58,245 --> 03:34:01,267
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, and- These are things that, I mean,

2478
03:34:03,181 --> 03:34:07,763
[SPEAKER_25]: You and I have lost a lot of mentors in the last couple of years.

2479
03:34:07,823 --> 03:34:15,965
[SPEAKER_25]: I can't, I could, you know, between Joe Grandy, Bud Kelly, Armin Carviello, I could go on and on.

2480
03:34:16,465 --> 03:34:20,727
[SPEAKER_25]: And, you know, you've kind of always said, you know, who's going to be there to

2481
03:34:22,587 --> 03:34:23,107
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm trying.

2482
03:34:24,268 --> 03:34:27,950
[SPEAKER_25]: But like I said, we can disagree on politics.

2483
03:34:27,970 --> 03:34:30,992
[SPEAKER_25]: We can disagree on all these things in life.

2484
03:34:31,092 --> 03:34:39,736
[SPEAKER_25]: But when it comes to things like this, this is something we can all agree on, that we can all come together and smile and be happy.

2485
03:34:39,777 --> 03:34:46,380
[SPEAKER_25]: And for a couple hours, go out and watch this team play and just be all proud that we're all from Medford.

2486
03:34:55,168 --> 03:35:02,431
[SPEAKER_36]: We're all together as Mustangs supporting our team.

2487
03:35:02,531 --> 03:35:07,594
[SPEAKER_36]: So, Nicole, I'll even buy a baby a nice little outfit, a little Mustang outfit.

2488
03:35:07,634 --> 03:35:09,175
[SPEAKER_36]: Chris, if you can.

2489
03:35:09,195 --> 03:35:15,338
[SPEAKER_25]: One of the big reasons I still do it, my kids love it.

2490
03:35:15,978 --> 03:35:18,519
[SPEAKER_25]: My four-year-old is, I'll pick him up from preschool.

2491
03:35:18,539 --> 03:35:19,980
[SPEAKER_25]: We're going to feed the football team today.

2492
03:35:21,923 --> 03:35:25,445
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm like, like we just don't feed them every day.

2493
03:35:25,465 --> 03:35:28,566
[SPEAKER_42]: I mean, we did have cancer saying, I'll go back to cancer.

2494
03:35:29,306 --> 03:35:29,946
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll be quick.

2495
03:35:30,206 --> 03:35:34,468
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, as a, as a high grad, I am so ready for this match.

2496
03:35:34,908 --> 03:35:36,749
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, I'm just so ready for it.

2497
03:35:37,989 --> 03:35:39,610
[SPEAKER_22]: I, I, I, you know what?

2498
03:35:39,730 --> 03:35:48,773
[SPEAKER_22]: I, you, you mentioned the record this year, but every time I go on Twitter and I see, um, uh, MHS athletics tweet out the results of how our, how our kids are doing.

2499
03:35:49,273 --> 03:35:52,216
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, it just makes me so proud to be from this community.

2500
03:35:52,556 --> 03:35:59,442
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think we talk a lot, we're always proud of you all and proud of your kids and the service they give back to the community.

2501
03:35:59,482 --> 03:36:07,609
[SPEAKER_22]: But, you know, we're always talking about what we can do to make, you know, make people more proud of Medford, make people more united in the city.

2502
03:36:07,649 --> 03:36:11,272
[SPEAKER_22]: And as you said it, as my fellow councillors have said it,

2503
03:36:11,692 --> 03:36:15,893
[SPEAKER_22]: You know, our football team is really, really shining the way right now.

2504
03:36:16,193 --> 03:36:20,674
[SPEAKER_22]: And just wanted to give you my thanks, my support, and go Mustangs.

2505
03:36:20,734 --> 03:36:24,735
[SPEAKER_25]: Real quick, seven Boston Globe Player of the Week weeks this year.

2506
03:36:24,915 --> 03:36:25,315
[SPEAKER_25]: Seven.

2507
03:36:25,335 --> 03:36:29,316
[SPEAKER_42]: So... Councilor Carvello, and then I'm just going in order.

2508
03:36:29,336 --> 03:36:30,356
[SPEAKER_42]: Who cares about football more?

2509
03:36:30,376 --> 03:36:31,736
[SPEAKER_42]: Then we'll go to you.

2510
03:36:32,316 --> 03:36:33,857
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, thank you.

2511
03:36:33,877 --> 03:36:36,137
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Madam President.

2512
03:36:36,817 --> 03:36:39,618
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, George and I come from a different generation.

2513
03:36:41,806 --> 03:36:45,508
[SPEAKER_21]: Sports was a big part of your high school.

2514
03:36:45,888 --> 03:36:47,830
[SPEAKER_21]: It developed pride in your high school.

2515
03:36:47,930 --> 03:36:49,891
[SPEAKER_21]: It was pride in the city.

2516
03:36:51,172 --> 03:36:56,255
[SPEAKER_21]: The city of Memphis, we were a football town forever.

2517
03:36:56,375 --> 03:37:00,437
[SPEAKER_21]: During my high school years, we used to go to the away games with like four buses of kids.

2518
03:37:00,917 --> 03:37:07,021
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you went, if you were a high school student, you went to the football game on Saturday afternoon.

2519
03:37:07,661 --> 03:37:08,402
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanksgiving day,

2520
03:37:09,576 --> 03:37:11,878
[SPEAKER_21]: God couldn't get a ticket on some years.

2521
03:37:12,558 --> 03:37:13,039
[SPEAKER_21]: You know that.

2522
03:37:13,899 --> 03:37:15,480
[SPEAKER_21]: The lines used to be around the corner.

2523
03:37:15,520 --> 03:37:16,941
[SPEAKER_21]: People waiting for tickets.

2524
03:37:17,862 --> 03:37:21,385
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanksgiving Day used to sell out weeks before the game.

2525
03:37:21,405 --> 03:37:24,667
[SPEAKER_21]: And that was not the pride of the community.

2526
03:37:24,687 --> 03:37:26,709
[SPEAKER_21]: It was our football team, our sports teams.

2527
03:37:29,067 --> 03:37:29,527
[SPEAKER_21]: We were there.

2528
03:37:30,108 --> 03:37:32,429
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what kids went to the school for.

2529
03:37:32,870 --> 03:37:37,993
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's part of the reason our teams have faltered over the years.

2530
03:37:38,053 --> 03:37:45,479
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's why you're seeing a lot of kids going to different schools now, because we have to get that pride back.

2531
03:37:45,539 --> 03:37:47,500
[SPEAKER_21]: It was there when I was there.

2532
03:37:47,520 --> 03:37:50,702
[SPEAKER_21]: It was there when George was there, when we were dominating teams.

2533
03:37:50,742 --> 03:37:53,424
[SPEAKER_21]: And you wanted to go to the games.

2534
03:37:53,444 --> 03:37:54,405
[SPEAKER_21]: You went to the hockey games.

2535
03:37:54,425 --> 03:37:55,106
[SPEAKER_21]: You went to the base.

2536
03:37:55,506 --> 03:37:56,266
[SPEAKER_21]: You went to games.

2537
03:37:57,355 --> 03:38:00,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, you don't forget the 90s with that soccer program.

2538
03:38:01,478 --> 03:38:04,501
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, there was some guy that was on the team, I don't forget his name.

2539
03:38:04,561 --> 03:38:13,728
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll tell you what, this guy over here, Councilor Scarpelli, was big in the early 2000s for getting us to go to each other's games.

2540
03:38:15,550 --> 03:38:22,975
[SPEAKER_25]: I went to soccer games in cities I didn't know existed to go watch Georgia's teams play.

2541
03:38:22,995 --> 03:38:27,798
[SPEAKER_36]: There was nothing better than listening to a group of Brazilian kids screaming defense while the offense was on the field.

2542
03:38:28,139 --> 03:38:30,580
[SPEAKER_36]: There was nothing better than that.

2543
03:38:30,861 --> 03:38:33,743
[SPEAKER_36]: We have other things we should celebrate, but we should be celebrating

2544
03:38:34,503 --> 03:38:41,990
[SPEAKER_36]: The fact that our marching band won the championship and came in this community, I love the fact that they had the police escorts come in.

2545
03:38:42,570 --> 03:38:44,012
[SPEAKER_36]: These are things we should be celebrating.

2546
03:38:44,032 --> 03:38:45,053
[SPEAKER_36]: We have so many great things.

2547
03:38:45,213 --> 03:38:46,574
[SPEAKER_36]: This is what elevates us.

2548
03:38:47,715 --> 03:38:48,816
[SPEAKER_36]: Thanksgiving is a good start.

2549
03:38:51,380 --> 03:38:58,925
[SPEAKER_24]: I was just about to bring up that about 15 years ago was when I picked up a sousaphone and played the fight song for the first time.

2550
03:38:59,946 --> 03:39:08,031
[SPEAKER_24]: And I would challenge anyone here to sing the, you know, we don't all know the lyrics, but I can sing you the fight song right now.

2551
03:39:08,071 --> 03:39:09,272
[SPEAKER_24]: It's playing in my head.

2552
03:39:09,832 --> 03:39:10,853
[SPEAKER_36]: I have it right here for everybody.

2553
03:39:12,547 --> 03:39:13,788
[SPEAKER_24]: See, I was playing an instrument.

2554
03:39:19,754 --> 03:39:20,195
[SPEAKER_24]: It's the best.

2555
03:39:20,515 --> 03:39:24,699
[SPEAKER_24]: But I just want to put out there, and Nicole, President Morrell's losing a little bit.

2556
03:39:25,039 --> 03:39:25,940
[SPEAKER_24]: You have a baby at home.

2557
03:39:26,000 --> 03:39:26,721
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's keep talking.

2558
03:39:26,741 --> 03:39:28,242
[SPEAKER_42]: It's public participation, I guess.

2559
03:39:29,924 --> 03:39:30,645
[SPEAKER_33]: public participation.

2560
03:39:31,645 --> 03:39:36,008
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm glad that I've seen probably more smiles on all your faces tonight.

2561
03:39:38,090 --> 03:39:42,913
[SPEAKER_24]: So you know, it was worth it.

2562
03:39:42,993 --> 03:39:46,136
[SPEAKER_24]: But I just want to say to that 15 years ago was the first time I played it.

2563
03:39:46,576 --> 03:39:51,920
[SPEAKER_24]: And if this season's team has broken my 15 year curse, I'm very much appreciative of it.

2564
03:39:52,040 --> 03:39:53,981
[SPEAKER_24]: So thank you guys so much.

2565
03:39:54,041 --> 03:39:54,942
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank you, Chris.

2566
03:39:56,323 --> 03:39:57,323
[SPEAKER_25]: It's funny.

2567
03:39:57,704 --> 03:39:59,325
[SPEAKER_25]: You know, it's I tell the kids, it's

2568
03:40:01,052 --> 03:40:05,118
[SPEAKER_25]: It's great to win games, but there's nothing like beating Malden.

2569
03:40:05,319 --> 03:40:05,679
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing.

2570
03:40:06,501 --> 03:40:09,906
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean... Onward, mighty Mustangs!

2571
03:40:10,487 --> 03:40:12,570
[SPEAKER_35]: Our hopes are pinned on you!

2572
03:40:13,632 --> 03:40:17,153
[SPEAKER_33]: We'll stampede the foe as onward we go.

2573
03:40:17,173 --> 03:40:19,654
[SPEAKER_33]: Onward to victory.

2574
03:40:19,814 --> 03:40:21,015
[SPEAKER_33]: Go, go, go.

2575
03:40:21,295 --> 03:40:23,635
[SPEAKER_33]: Onward, mighty Mustangs.

2576
03:40:23,876 --> 03:40:26,977
[SPEAKER_33]: We want a touchdown, hear our cry.

2577
03:40:26,997 --> 03:40:33,859
[SPEAKER_33]: Our galloping on to victory for Medford High.

2578
03:40:33,879 --> 03:40:35,319
[SPEAKER_33]: How do you like that?

2579
03:40:35,980 --> 03:40:36,600
[SPEAKER_40]: How do you like that?

2580
03:40:43,467 --> 03:40:47,590
[SPEAKER_25]: With the exception of the time I might've sang that with Bishop Irwin at my confirmation.

2581
03:40:48,231 --> 03:40:52,014
[SPEAKER_25]: This is probably the best rendition I've ever had of the song.

2582
03:40:52,054 --> 03:40:56,318
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess it's not coming in more often.

2583
03:40:56,338 --> 03:41:01,202
[SPEAKER_21]: Chris, there should be something recognizing our Super Bowl team there at Hormel.

2584
03:41:06,403 --> 03:41:11,367
[SPEAKER_25]: I would like to tear the whole complex down and build it up and do something nice.

2585
03:41:11,387 --> 03:41:14,049
[SPEAKER_25]: But yeah, there should definitely be something for your uncle there.

2586
03:41:14,069 --> 03:41:15,350
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, there should be.

2587
03:41:15,390 --> 03:41:16,991
[SPEAKER_21]: Something to recognize in the team.

2588
03:41:17,011 --> 03:41:17,832
[SPEAKER_25]: We'll work on that.

2589
03:41:18,472 --> 03:41:19,313
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

2590
03:41:19,453 --> 03:41:19,713
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2591
03:41:20,193 --> 03:41:21,034
[SPEAKER_25]: All right.

2592
03:41:21,294 --> 03:41:22,815
[SPEAKER_25]: I know you all have families.

2593
03:41:22,955 --> 03:41:24,456
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm gonna go home and get yelled at.

2594
03:41:25,257 --> 03:41:25,837
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Chris.

2595
03:41:27,608 --> 03:41:28,249
[SPEAKER_42]: Motion to adjourn.

2596
03:41:28,269 --> 03:41:29,091
[SPEAKER_42]: Second by Councilor Sang.

2597
03:41:29,111 --> 03:41:29,551
[SPEAKER_42]: All those in favor?

2598
03:41:29,572 --> 03:41:29,772
[SPEAKER_42]: Aye.

2599
03:41:29,812 --> 03:41:30,373
[SPEAKER_42]: Opposed?

2600
03:41:32,056 --> 03:41:32,757
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion passed.

2601
03:41:32,897 --> 03:41:33,619
[SPEAKER_24]: Meeting adjourned.
