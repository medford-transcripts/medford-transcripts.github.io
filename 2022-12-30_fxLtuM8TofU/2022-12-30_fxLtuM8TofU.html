    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/fxLtuM8TofU&t=0.069s">[Reporter]</a>:  Also breaking tonight, Medford High School students will have to comply with new security protocols when they go back to class.
 The superintendent sent a letter to parents today explaining the extra precautions.
 Remember, a student was stabbed in a bathroom earlier this month.
 Afterwards, several students complained about a lack of safety on campus and actually staged a walkout.
 Starting Tuesday, bathrooms will be monitored and will be limited to two students at a time.
 Tonight, WBZ reached out to the family of the stabbing victim.
 That's 17-year-old Jordan Pineda.
 His mother says she does not believe these new measures are going to help.
 She also said her son is recovering physically, but will carry the mental trauma forever.
