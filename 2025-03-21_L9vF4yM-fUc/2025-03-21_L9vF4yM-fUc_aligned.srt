1
00:00:03,443 --> 00:00:08,487
The 25th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order.

2
00:00:09,168 --> 00:00:12,131
Mr. Clerk, welcome back and please call the roll.

3
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:14,553
Is anybody here?

4
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:17,275
Councilor Caviello?

5
00:00:20,758 --> 00:00:21,319
Councilor Falco?

6
00:00:21,339 --> 00:00:21,539
Present.

7
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:23,901
Councilor Knight?

8
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:24,281
Present.

9
00:00:25,562 --> 00:00:26,423
Vice President Leno of Kern?

10
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:26,583
Present.

11
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:28,245
Councilor Marks?

12
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:28,405
Present.

13
00:00:29,866 --> 00:00:30,627
Councilor Scarpelli?

14
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,410
President De La Russo.

15
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,070
Present.

16
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,891
Six members present, one nearly absent or absent.

17
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:43,532
Please join us in rising to salute the flag of the United States of America.

18
00:00:43,552 --> 00:00:56,274
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

19
00:00:57,714 --> 00:00:58,514
Commendations.

20
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:02,335
Tonight we have with us present the Medford

21
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,642
high school crew team silver medal winners at the state championship.

22
00:01:08,342 --> 00:01:18,467
This was offered by Councilor Marks, and we're welcome to have with us coaches and members of the crew team to receive their commendations.

23
00:01:19,007 --> 00:01:26,870
And at this time, I invite Councilor Marks up to share those commendations with these fine young men.

24
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,059
Thank you, Mr. President.

25
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:56,165
It's my honor tonight to offer these council accommodations to the Meffitt High row team for the full boys squad.

26
00:01:56,665 --> 00:02:00,407
This is the fourth year in a row that they have won the GBL title.

27
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:09,756
are JV4.

28
00:02:10,937 --> 00:02:21,122
They qualified for the New England Interscholastic Rowing Championship, and they finished 16th among all the prep, Catholic, and public schools from New England.

29
00:02:21,922 --> 00:02:23,042
Another big accomplishment.

30
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:35,868
So I want to recognize, I know there's at least two on the team that are with us tonight,

31
00:02:38,047 --> 00:02:47,614
I was just talking to some of the rowing team members, and they mentioned a funny story that took place this year at one of the row meets.

32
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:53,178
There was a race between Somerville and Method, which always gets a little heated.

33
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:58,462
And Method pulled out and beat Somerville.

34
00:02:59,463 --> 00:03:06,708
And after the race, the Somerville team came over and said, you only beat us because we had one of our novice in the boats.

35
00:03:07,494 --> 00:03:09,134
And that's the only reason why you beat us.

36
00:03:09,755 --> 00:03:19,077
So Method being the community it is, said, get your JV, get your whole JV team, we'll meet you down on the river, and we'll race again without your novice.

37
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:21,157
Sure enough, the race took place.

38
00:03:21,857 --> 00:03:23,038
And gentlemen, who won the race?

39
00:03:24,778 --> 00:03:25,618
Method won again.

40
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,840
I thought that was a great story.

41
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:41,230
And one other thing, too, you can always tell when the Rowe team walks in because they have the Popeye forearms, right?

42
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,550
And they're all in great shape.

43
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,212
I tell everyone, you want to get in great shape, Rowe.

44
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:48,514
The only one that's not in great shape is the Coxswain.

45
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:48,934
Where is he?

46
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:49,855
Where's the Coxswain?

47
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:55,639
He's not in bad shape.

48
00:03:55,679 --> 00:03:56,559
He's not in bad shape.

49
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,562
The Coxswain is very similar to the city council.

50
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:08,581
You have the council president that box out the orders, and you have the rowers that do all the work on the side.

51
00:04:08,701 --> 00:04:12,521
So it's very similar, just so you know.

52
00:04:13,302 --> 00:04:16,062
You may have a future someday in city politics.

53
00:04:17,702 --> 00:04:29,685
But at this point, I'd like to recognize the novice four boat members who were the silver member medalists for this year.

54
00:04:30,226 --> 00:04:32,087
and they did our community very proud.

55
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:33,807
I will read them.

56
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:37,289
I know there's only one or two here tonight, but I will read them.

57
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:51,615
It says, the Meffitt City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Nathan Piera, Meffitt High School varsity rowing team, in recognition of winning a Novice Four Boat Civil Medal at the State Rowing Championship.

58
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:03,828
We have Sebastian Tringali.

59
00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:06,629
He's at camp.

60
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:07,509
Good for him.

61
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,371
Giandotto Pintone.

62
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:21,113
Congratulations.

63
00:05:21,553 --> 00:05:22,033
Great job.

64
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:27,695
Dylan Bambino.

65
00:05:31,112 --> 00:05:33,754
On vacation, where we all should be.

66
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:37,377
Isaac.

67
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:45,823
Congratulations.

68
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:46,204
Thank you.

69
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:47,745
Good job.

70
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:53,109
Edward McCormick, the coach.

71
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:54,190
Come on up, Ed.

72
00:06:00,248 --> 00:06:02,009
You know, we don't have a team without a good coach.

73
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:14,098
And I'll tell you, Edward has done yeoman's work, no pun, on putting together a program that really reflects our community and really reflects a program that is up and coming.

74
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:21,023
And we went from a community that was not known for rowing at all to being a program that's recognized statewide.

75
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:28,208
And that's partly due to students and their competitive nature and their dedication, but also due to the coach.

76
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:30,202
So coach, do you have a few words you'd like to say?

77
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:30,923
Thank you.

78
00:06:30,943 --> 00:06:31,764
Thank you, coach.

79
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:43,173
The only story I'd like to say is the reason why we're here is because Isaac, or Coxon, actually his equipment broke in the first 100 meters of the race.

80
00:06:44,935 --> 00:06:51,300
The rules are that if there's a legitimate break of equipment, you can stop the race as a freshman.

81
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:53,002
He was smart enough to do that.

82
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:59,002
His steering cables had broken, and he realized that he wasn't going to make it down the race course, and he stopped the race.

83
00:06:59,563 --> 00:07:01,824
The referees realized it was a legal stop.

84
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:06,307
They called me so I could repair the boat, and they went back up and raced the race.

85
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:11,530
And that's why we have the silver medal, because of a very, very smart ninth grader from Medford High.

86
00:07:19,235 --> 00:07:21,516
And we also have the assistant coach,

87
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:24,164
who is Chris DelaRusso.

88
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:28,227
And I want to thank him personally for his efforts on behalf of the students.

89
00:07:33,431 --> 00:07:48,963
Congratulations.

90
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,865
Let's get a photo.

91
00:07:52,008 --> 00:07:59,933
We're just going to vote.

92
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:02,175
By the way, are you, is that it?

93
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:07,439
Do you have an email address?

94
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:09,500
There's a red one, too.

95
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,882
You know, one of the guys raised his hand.

96
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:26,970
Come on, circle around, guys.

97
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,211
All right.

98
00:09:46,992 --> 00:09:56,036
16-571 offered by Councillor Marks be resolved that the do not enter in one-way signs on Newburn Ave be made larger or fixed at a reasonable eyesight level over the past two weeks.

99
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,858
Cars are going up Newburn rather than down and causing a public safety issue.

100
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:00,838
Councillor Marks.

101
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:03,720
Thank you, Mr. President.

102
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,282
I was contacted by a few residents that are seeing cars come up the one-way.

103
00:10:09,062 --> 00:10:14,965
They believe it's because of the one-way and do not enter signs being at a much higher than eye level

104
00:10:16,173 --> 00:10:18,775
uh, view and also the size of the sign.

105
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:25,919
So I ask that this be sent to the traffic commission for, uh, their review and eventual approval.

106
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:45,490
Mr. President, on the motion approved by council marks, all those in favor, all those opposed motion carries offered by vice-president low current 16 dash five 72 offered by a vice-president long current be resolved that, uh, in all future board of appeals hearings, notices are sent to all people within 300 feet radius of the requesting property.

107
00:10:45,914 --> 00:10:46,715
Madam Vice President.

108
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:48,736
Thank you, President De La Russo.

109
00:10:48,796 --> 00:10:51,078
I'd just like a roll call vote on this.

110
00:10:52,799 --> 00:11:06,528
It's come to my attention, especially since the Locust Street approval of 11 variances, that in past projects, the full 300 feet radius residents have not been notified accordingly.

111
00:11:06,548 --> 00:11:12,612
I think spot notification has taken place on some instances, and I think for transparent

112
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:32,241
purposes and to be informative to the neighborhood or wherever is going to be possibly affected that all residents within 300 feet radius of the proposed property get notified of any Board of Appeal hearing or, you know, request for a variance.

113
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:41,286
I think it's extremely important that we do that and we keep it to the 300 feet and not pick and choose who we send notifications to.

114
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:42,727
So I'd ask for a roll call vote.

115
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,908
And we request that the Board of Appeals adhere to this.

116
00:11:47,469 --> 00:11:50,070
I'm under the impression that this is a matter of law.

117
00:11:50,591 --> 00:12:04,900
It's done with a certified, under pains of perjury, certification from the assessor of the location of all houses, and that they mailed, and that it's three weeks notified in public publication.

118
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:06,721
Counselor Knight.

119
00:12:07,501 --> 00:12:08,142
Yes, Mr. President.

120
00:12:08,162 --> 00:12:12,765
I'd ask how this resolution differs from the actual standard that's in place currently.

121
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,272
I've got complaints that the full 300 feet have not been notified, and I think that's extremely important.

122
00:12:22,332 --> 00:12:26,153
And if that is not taking place, I'm asking the City Council support that it does.

123
00:12:27,533 --> 00:12:29,014
I have no information that it's not.

124
00:12:29,554 --> 00:12:30,574
Citizen wishes to speak.

125
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:33,395
Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

126
00:12:34,455 --> 00:12:35,636
Thank you very much for bringing this up.

127
00:12:37,116 --> 00:12:42,998
The people that abutted Locust Street didn't receive letters when they put up the smaller buildings.

128
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:47,751
But nobody complained because those buildings weren't as large as the complex that's going down in 61.

129
00:12:48,952 --> 00:12:56,257
And also, the 61 Locust Street, they were not notified, not even the abutters, not even the physical abutters were not notified.

130
00:12:56,557 --> 00:12:57,658
They did not receive a letter.

131
00:12:58,218 --> 00:13:03,122
So just to put that out there that there may be a falling through the cracks issue here.

132
00:13:03,342 --> 00:13:04,042
So thank you very much.

133
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:04,903
Absolutely.

134
00:13:04,923 --> 00:13:06,324
Thank you, Jean.

135
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:09,366
And I also got a complaint about a few streets.

136
00:13:09,446 --> 00:13:12,008
One of them was Prescott Street back about a year ago.

137
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:17,526
That's two instances right there and another two that I probably got calls on.

138
00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:24,112
So I think it's important that we take a stand and that we ask for notification, um, with regards to a 300 feet radius.

139
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:31,879
And I think that's the law and our legal expert in house, uh, our city solicitor wishes to address us.

140
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:34,862
Good evening, Mr. President.

141
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:35,903
My name is Mark Romley.

142
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:36,964
I'm the city solicitor.

143
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:40,107
I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford.

144
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:59,923
And the council's resolution, you can always do more than what the law requires, but I wanted to make one thing very clear, and that's under Chapter 40A, what's required for notice, and the, as you said, the names and addresses of the people who are entitled to notice are certified by the assessor's office, and then they go out from the clerk of the Board of Appeals.

145
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:06,008
What is required is that notice go out to all abutters and abutters to the abutters.

146
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:07,430
That's under Chapter 40A.

147
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:19,593
What is being suggested in this resolution is that from now on the city of Medford go beyond that to all of the people who live within the ambit of the 300 feet of the proposal.

148
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:28,557
You can always do more, but I didn't want anybody to, uh, listening to this discussion to feel that somebody has been short changed under the law.

149
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:36,780
The law was complied with, although it was not, and it was not necessary to get every abutter within the 300 feet, the abutters,

150
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:42,571
And abutters to the abutters, as funny as that may sound, is what is legally required under Chapter 48.

151
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:48,415
But if the city wants to go further than that and require more notice, there's nothing wrong with that.

152
00:14:50,156 --> 00:14:54,539
On the motion for approval by Vice President Lugo-Curran, please call the roll.

153
00:14:54,559 --> 00:15:03,705
Mr. President, if the city solicitor has a moment to answer this question, the resolution says notice is sent to all people within a 300-foot radius.

154
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:06,547
It's my understanding that presently with

155
00:15:07,358 --> 00:15:12,040
the term of butter, it's property owner versus a renter or a person that would be living.

156
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,901
Yes, the list is always compiled on the basis of property owner.

157
00:15:14,941 --> 00:15:15,181
That's right.

158
00:15:15,201 --> 00:15:16,642
Because it's from the assessor's database of taxpayers.

159
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:27,567
Right, because sometimes a tenant, especially in a residential property, they could change and there's no need for a tenant who is leasing a property or even a tenant at will.

160
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,248
The assessor's office would not necessarily have that data.

161
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:34,810
The notice under the law goes to the owner of the property.

162
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,712
And which makes sense, by the way, because the owner has full title interest in the property.

163
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:45,376
And if the particular project would be something that would impede their property rights, they should know.

164
00:15:45,956 --> 00:15:51,819
A tenant may be somebody who's going to be there for a few months and really couldn't care if they're living next to a nuclear reactor.

165
00:15:54,381 --> 00:15:55,542
Thank you, Mr. Solicitor.

166
00:15:55,562 --> 00:16:00,705
Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to strike the word all people and replace with all property owners.

167
00:16:00,845 --> 00:16:03,746
Motion that the paper be amended to

168
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:09,347
strike all people, to replace it with all property owners.

169
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:10,568
Roll call, please.

170
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:12,610
Citizen wishes to speak.

171
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,090
Oh, sorry.

172
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:18,075
The chair recognizes the esteemed citizen of East Medford.

173
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:20,116
Please state your name and address for the record.

174
00:16:20,136 --> 00:16:24,900
Thank you, Council President De La Russo, Andrew Kasten, Eddie Cushman, Street Medford, Massachusetts.

175
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:32,927
I was thinking out loud, out of the box, City Solicitor Rumley mentioned that we could

176
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:41,083
maybe change, the way I understood, the parameters of 300 feet to make it further for notices.

177
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:46,526
And Brianna brought up some good points that I had missed some of them earlier, because I came in a little late.

178
00:16:47,527 --> 00:16:52,430
If one wants to change, if it's possible, I presume, first of all, Chapter 48 is a state law.

179
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:59,755
And if you want to change it, maybe 300 feet, or 500 feet, or 1,000 feet would not be sufficient, especially when

180
00:17:04,448 --> 00:17:23,520
depending on the city or town, when you have a development of 300 or 500 or 6,000 units, depending on the population, the locale, I mean, 300 feet would be a butters and a butters, a butters possibly.

181
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:31,906
However, if it's a large unit for that city or town, it might affect five square miles or at least

182
00:17:33,246 --> 00:17:34,327
one and a half square miles.

183
00:17:35,087 --> 00:17:35,448
Thank you.

184
00:17:36,008 --> 00:17:36,348
Thank you.

185
00:17:36,969 --> 00:17:43,614
On the motion for approval by Councilor Longo Kern as amended by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

186
00:17:44,475 --> 00:17:44,655
Yes.

187
00:17:44,675 --> 00:17:44,755
Yes.

188
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:44,975
Yes.

189
00:17:45,015 --> 00:17:45,295
Yes.

190
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:47,037
Yes.

191
00:17:47,977 --> 00:17:48,118
Yes.

192
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:49,959
Seven in the affirmative.

193
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:51,000
Motion passes.

194
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,103
16-573 offered by Vice President Longo Kern.

195
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:13,409
Be it resolved that the city administration provide the city council with an update on what is being done on the city side regarding the low-flying noise from airplanes in our community.

196
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:17,353
Is that the noise from low-flying airplanes?

197
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:19,314
Madam Vice President.

198
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,955
Thank you, President De La Ruzo.

199
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:25,319
With regards to what's been going on, I know we've probably all got complaints.

200
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:29,122
We've received a number of complaints, especially from the North Method.

201
00:18:30,827 --> 00:18:39,691
area in the Heights with regards to low-flying planes, the noise, the disturbances, a lot of it happening between 5 p.m.

202
00:18:39,732 --> 00:18:50,957
and 10 p.m., disrupting people's ability to enjoy their home with their windows open or to sit out on their porch or patio and be able to even have a conversation.

203
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:56,600
I live in the Heights, so I've obviously noticed that.

204
00:18:57,156 --> 00:19:04,862
And then I went down to a couple of places where I've received the complaints, one being Shardanav, and you could not have a conversation.

205
00:19:05,283 --> 00:19:07,644
Every five minutes, low-flying planes.

206
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:18,393
And I know when you report — and I've — multiple complaints have — I've received, so I think it's definitely time for an update to see what the new administration is doing.

207
00:19:18,413 --> 00:19:25,499
I know — I believe somebody's been appointed to the Massport Advisory Commission, but if we could get an update on who that is.

208
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:32,442
and see what has been done, if they're actually attending meetings, and any update with regards to this issue.

209
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:54,914
I know if a resident, I have a few complaints that were called in to Massachusetts Port Authority Noise Abatement Office, and they do respond to the complaints, but a lot of the responses are that they're, you know, it's obviously runway 33L, and they're following FAA standard operating procedure.

210
00:19:55,395 --> 00:20:04,897
So I just want to make sure somebody from Medford is representing our concerns and bringing our questions and seeing if something can be done to change what is going on.

211
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:10,879
Because I don't think the standard operating procedure is working for the city of Medford.

212
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,620
And I know it's only during certain months, depending on which way the wind's flying.

213
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:22,542
But if we could get an update with regards to who's been appointed to the Massport Advisory Commission and

214
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:34,236
what is being done from our administration to try to alleviate some of this disturbance and obviously, this is a breach of your quiet enjoyment when you're trying to have dinner outside or enjoy your home.

215
00:20:34,256 --> 00:20:38,117
I think- On the motion for approval by Vice President Largo-Curran, Councilor Knight.

216
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,018
Mr. President, thank you very much.

217
00:20:40,718 --> 00:20:42,799
This is an issue that I think we're all rather familiar with.

218
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:46,201
We've all been experiencing the noise in one fashion or another.

219
00:20:46,221 --> 00:20:48,902
I honestly have

220
00:20:50,693 --> 00:20:54,876
made several inquiries into this, and it's a very interesting situation, Mr. President.

221
00:20:55,276 --> 00:21:02,342
Up until very recently, the flight patterns that were being used were based on the same technology that was used during World War II.

222
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:05,164
I spoke with a gentleman by the name of Stephen Bolognese.

223
00:21:05,184 --> 00:21:09,427
He's an attorney, and he's one of the premier aviation experts here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

224
00:21:10,075 --> 00:21:16,880
And he explained to me that the way that planes used to fly was through a beacon system, and it was the same technology that was used in World War II.

225
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:25,005
In the late 1990s, the federal government adopted a push towards using GPS-monitored flying control systems, Mr. President.

226
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:32,750
And the reason they did that is because about 80 percent of the airspace wasn't being utilized under the post-World War II process.

227
00:21:33,811 --> 00:21:37,273
So I think that this is going to get worse before it gets better.

228
00:21:38,042 --> 00:21:41,245
But the mayor has taken affirmative steps and steps that I'm very pleased with.

229
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:46,829
She's appointed attorney Leonard Gleona to the Massport Advisory Council to represent the city of Medford, Mr. President.

230
00:21:46,949 --> 00:21:52,814
And in my conversations with Mr. Gleona, he's already informed me that he's been to at least two meetings over there at Massport.

231
00:21:53,014 --> 00:22:00,240
And he's also been in contact with our state delegation to ask for some assistance where they have some funding responsibilities with the Massachusetts Port Authority.

232
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:03,959
So with that being said, I certainly appreciate the work that Mr. Glaman has done.

233
00:22:03,999 --> 00:22:09,401
I think he's a great choice for the job and he's more than capable of helping the city of Medford address this issue and this concern.

234
00:22:09,821 --> 00:22:14,503
I support the resolution that the councilor has put forward and I look forward to hearing Mr. Glaman's response.

235
00:22:15,443 --> 00:22:19,624
Mr. Glaman is a great and competent attorney and a great advocate for our community.

236
00:22:20,124 --> 00:22:22,565
Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

237
00:22:23,025 --> 00:22:24,046
Thank you, Mr. President.

238
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:26,606
I also support this resolution 100%.

239
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,052
I have received a number of calls over the past couple of weeks throughout the city.

240
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:37,955
Down on Park Street over in West Medford, I've received calls as well.

241
00:22:38,875 --> 00:22:43,318
I live in the Heights as well, and I just walk out into my backyard, and there's a plane flying over.

242
00:22:43,358 --> 00:22:46,860
And they're flying low, and it's like every minute and a half, they're flying over the house.

243
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,681
And it's just, it is continuous.

244
00:22:49,481 --> 00:22:56,065
So it's definitely a major problem that impacts almost every neighborhood in this city.

245
00:22:56,305 --> 00:22:57,845
And it's really a-

246
00:22:59,872 --> 00:23:02,913
We're fine in South Medford.

247
00:23:02,973 --> 00:23:03,693
That's not what I hear.

248
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:05,873
But I mean, from what I hear, they're coming right over.

249
00:23:05,893 --> 00:23:09,214
I was at Harvard Street, I think.

250
00:23:09,594 --> 00:23:13,055
But it's an issue that affects every neighborhood in the city.

251
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:15,275
And it really impacts the quality of life.

252
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:18,036
So it's definitely something I support.

253
00:23:18,056 --> 00:23:20,216
I know there is a noise hotline that people can call.

254
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:24,997
And Massport does keep track of the people that do call.

255
00:23:25,017 --> 00:23:26,378
So I think it's important that people call.

256
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,484
561-3333, and it's staffed by Massport employees.

257
00:23:33,765 --> 00:23:38,168
And it's definitely something that I think the more people that call, the better.

258
00:23:38,188 --> 00:23:45,354
I think it lets the people at Massport know that this is something that impacts our quality of life.

259
00:23:45,854 --> 00:23:55,883
And I just wanted to just say that in support of this resolution, and hopefully we can do something to reduce the flights that cross over our city.

260
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:56,303
Thank you.

261
00:23:58,392 --> 00:23:59,172
Thank you, Councilor.

262
00:23:59,512 --> 00:24:00,992
Chair recognizes Councilor Max.

263
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,173
Thank you, Mr. President.

264
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:05,113
I want to thank Councilor Longo for putting this on.

265
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:18,235
This has been an issue for many years, and unfortunately this city has done very little in regards to trying to rectify the issue that residents are having.

266
00:24:19,175 --> 00:24:28,177
If you look at the complaints, as Councilor Falco just mentioned, and I went on their website and looked up May, that was the last available,

267
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:34,643
there were 174 complaints issued by residents of Method, and that's in 2016.

268
00:24:35,143 --> 00:24:39,306
And if you look in 2015, there were 101.

269
00:24:40,186 --> 00:24:49,292
So that's almost a 75% increase in complaints year over year, which leads me to believe that there's more flights over this community.

270
00:24:49,952 --> 00:24:57,597
And when you look at the statistics, and I know there's a group of Method residents that are organized in this community, and moving forward,

271
00:24:58,271 --> 00:25:03,112
on a way to help alleviate some of the concerns we have as residents.

272
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:11,554
They mentioned runway 33L, and that's the departures that are leaving Logan Airport.

273
00:25:12,414 --> 00:25:21,476
This year, compared to last year, there was an additional 500 flights on runway 33L, which directly flies over this community.

274
00:25:22,816 --> 00:25:24,657
And that is a major concern.

275
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:25,237
I realize

276
00:25:25,953 --> 00:25:33,414
win patents, and there's a number of circumstances that would alter air flight.

277
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:40,096
But in my opinion, Mr. President, this community is bearing a brunt of the noise.

278
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:52,698
And to take it one step further, if you go on their website, they have — Massport has a whole mitigation site, and they brag about giving out millions of dollars in soundproofing

279
00:25:53,218 --> 00:26:03,984
And they list the communities and what they've done replacing windows and other soundproofing initiatives in homes, schools, churches, you name it.

280
00:26:04,704 --> 00:26:10,828
And the city of Method has one noise detector in the city.

281
00:26:10,908 --> 00:26:13,369
I believe it may be in the Morrison Park area.

282
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:22,454
And in my opinion, a city seven square miles to have one noise detector really is not an adequate capturing of

283
00:26:23,077 --> 00:26:31,341
uh, the noise that we're experiencing throughout the neighborhoods, North Meffitt, South Meffitt, West Meffitt, uh, Wellington, uh, the hillside.

284
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:48,308
Um, and I would ask if my council colleague doesn't mind that we request through Massport that they, uh, add at least another three or four of these, uh, noise, uh, units, uh, that measures the decibel, uh, sound levels.

285
00:26:49,017 --> 00:26:59,622
And according to, I guess, federal FAA rules, that there's a certain decibel level that's allowed.

286
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:04,644
And in that area, we may be under the decibel level, according to Massport.

287
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:17,330
But I would venture to say, if more of these monitors were put in other sections, and I would ask that they be put in every neighborhood in this community, one in every neighborhood, Mr. President, that we'll find a difference

288
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:22,789
of what Massport's reporting compared to what our residents are experiencing.

289
00:27:23,389 --> 00:27:46,680
And so I would ask, if my colleague Councilor Longo doesn't mind, that we request that Massport locate these noise decibel, I don't know what they refer to exactly, equipment in the North Mefford neighborhood, the South Mefford neighborhood, the Wellington neighborhood, the Hillside neighborhood, and I believe there is one in the East Mefford,

290
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:57,464
area, but I may stand to be corrected on that, but that it encompassed all the neighborhoods, Mr. President, and I ask that that be part of the report.

291
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:02,649
And I look forward to some more dialogue with Massport.

292
00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:16,600
We may not be a direct abutter, but we certainly experience these flights coming in that are trying to land in Logan Airport, making very low turnarounds in our community, waiting for runways to open up.

293
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,977
and so forth, Mr. President.

294
00:28:19,037 --> 00:28:21,819
So I will make that as a formal motion.

295
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:28,163
On the motion for approval by Vice President Lugo-Kern, as amended by Councilor Marks, chair recognizes Vice President Lugo-Kern.

296
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:29,503
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

297
00:28:29,564 --> 00:28:36,348
If we can further amend it to ask Attorney Lenny Gliona to come to our July meeting, if he's available.

298
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:42,011
The city's representative to the Massport Authority.

299
00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:46,814
And so that

300
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:53,532
Yep, so that he could update us with regards to the communications he's had with the state delegation and what's being done.

301
00:28:53,572 --> 00:28:55,012
That'll be extremely helpful.

302
00:28:57,012 --> 00:29:04,014
As amended by Councilors Mark and herself, Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

303
00:29:04,255 --> 00:29:04,995
Thank you, Mr. President.

304
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:16,318
So I think we've all heard the same complaints, but you know, the honest truth is the next three years, it's going to be 11 more airlines coming into Boston.

305
00:29:17,076 --> 00:29:21,239
at Logan Airport, not counting the growth of the existing airlines.

306
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,180
So it's a problem that's only going to get worse.

307
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:30,064
And I think what people don't realize is you have flights taking off as late as 1.30 a.m.

308
00:29:30,104 --> 00:29:30,285
now.

309
00:29:31,105 --> 00:29:32,246
We never had that before.

310
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:35,908
And they're coming in as early as 4.30 a.m.

311
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:44,234
So, again, let's say it's a problem that's only going to get worse, not better, and it's best that we get on it now as

312
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:47,318
before these airlines start coming in.

313
00:29:47,938 --> 00:30:00,480
On the motion for approval by Vice President Lungo Kern, as amended by Councilors Mox and Vice President Lungo Kern, the Chair recognizes, yet again, the esteemed citizen from East Medford.

314
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:03,221
You're very kind, Council President.

315
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:07,122
I have two points of hopeful common sense.

316
00:30:08,042 --> 00:30:15,403
I've noticed, it seems, when the planes are flying low and overhead, it's a west wind or a south wind.

317
00:30:16,346 --> 00:30:21,710
And I presume the airlines want to save fuel, as in U.S.

318
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,270
dollars.

319
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:34,919
And it seems like their path is down Riverside Avenue or in front of the Dalai Lama's temple, Central Avenue, heading west.

320
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:36,800
Okay.

321
00:30:37,901 --> 00:30:38,741
That being one.

322
00:30:40,643 --> 00:30:43,805
The second point is, I believe this runway is no

323
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:46,834
It's not even 10 years old thereabouts.

324
00:30:48,315 --> 00:31:03,728
And if I recollect correctly, all the cities and towns on this proposed flight path before they built the runway was invited to speak to Massport about this before construction.

325
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:11,755
And I believe that would have been, and hopefully people did go from Medford community to

326
00:31:13,722 --> 00:31:15,923
make their points and concerns known.

327
00:31:17,403 --> 00:31:24,285
And regardless, I'm not sure how much weight we could carry unless we had good old Tip O'Neill to block it.

328
00:31:25,445 --> 00:31:30,687
I wish her luck, because it bothers me and Riverside Ave, and it bothers my friend Getschy Tenley at the temple.

329
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:34,488
Good evening, ma'am.

330
00:31:34,528 --> 00:31:36,189
Please state your name and address for the record.

331
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:37,729
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

332
00:31:37,769 --> 00:31:39,110
I live at 281 Park Street.

333
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,491
So it's Logan Airport, Medford.

334
00:31:43,731 --> 00:31:46,212
It started really getting bad about two years ago.

335
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:48,453
My daughter's eight now at six years old.

336
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:53,156
She started projectile vomiting in the middle of the night from being woken up by the planes.

337
00:31:53,856 --> 00:32:05,621
It took two years of going to specialists and now she's on daily medication because of the sleep interruption causing migraines and vomiting, which they attribute to the planes flying less than 5,000 feet over my house.

338
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:10,954
I don't think the sacrifice is worth it to save them fuel.

339
00:32:11,174 --> 00:32:12,675
I think they need to fly higher.

340
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:15,277
My mother-in-law lives in East Boston.

341
00:32:15,297 --> 00:32:17,178
You can walk to the airport from her house.

342
00:32:17,238 --> 00:32:19,920
She comes to my house and says, I can't believe it's this loud here.

343
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:28,386
You know, Medford needs to stand up and tell them to stop because other towns have stood up and they've been able to get the planes to fly higher.

344
00:32:28,426 --> 00:32:31,308
There's no reason for them to be under 5,000 feet in Medford.

345
00:32:31,889 --> 00:32:33,210
I don't care what the winds look like.

346
00:32:36,097 --> 00:32:36,817
Good evening, sir.

347
00:32:36,897 --> 00:32:38,678
Please state your name and address for the record.

348
00:32:39,078 --> 00:32:39,298
Sure.

349
00:32:39,718 --> 00:32:41,499
Luke Pryzner, 140 Forest Street.

350
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,160
And I want to thank the council for this measure.

351
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,441
I think it's a pretty serious problem.

352
00:32:49,461 --> 00:32:50,882
It's a relatively new problem.

353
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,022
It's about three years old.

354
00:32:53,002 --> 00:32:58,044
I'll echo a lot of things that were said by councillors, and I kind of welcome the ideas.

355
00:32:58,844 --> 00:33:03,306
I think this kind of dialogue kind of moves the issue forward a little bit.

356
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:13,903
Yeah, so prior to 2012, so in 2012, the FAA had a Modernization Act, and it was called the Next Gen Modernization Act.

357
00:33:14,844 --> 00:33:21,346
It's legislation, and it led to the adoption of precision navigation technology.

358
00:33:23,463 --> 00:33:26,805
So this big policy measure was rolled out in various phases.

359
00:33:28,365 --> 00:33:32,788
And Boston Logan is one of the 30 core airports in the United States.

360
00:33:33,608 --> 00:33:47,515
So the 30 core airports began upgrading and adopting new procedures and activating new techniques that were now facilitated by modern equipment.

361
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:51,143
I won't get into all the technical details, but there's a lot of them.

362
00:33:51,984 --> 00:33:54,967
And this problem's been studied by community groups.

363
00:33:55,207 --> 00:33:56,948
There's two significant ones.

364
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:04,074
There's the Boston West Fair Skies group, which represents Medford, Belmont, Cambridge, Somerville.

365
00:34:04,094 --> 00:34:05,776
They're very active.

366
00:34:06,276 --> 00:34:14,663
And there's a second group, which is Boston Fair Skies, and that's primarily kind of the South Shore, specifically Milton.

367
00:34:15,204 --> 00:34:17,286
Milton's been kind of

368
00:34:17,997 --> 00:34:19,438
the most vocal community.

369
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:23,340
If you look at the complaints, I mean, Milton complaints are in the thousands.

370
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,502
And they get the double whammy because they get the arrivals and the departures.

371
00:34:28,142 --> 00:34:34,645
So anyway, so the community groups are, they're mobilized and pretty active.

372
00:34:35,926 --> 00:34:37,086
We use technology.

373
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:40,648
We actually have an ADSP receiver, so we know

374
00:34:42,568 --> 00:34:43,649
where all the aircraft are.

375
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:53,416
We kind of follow their tracks and, you know, we can say exactly what the flight path is and analyze the data to see whether or not they're flying too low.

376
00:34:54,797 --> 00:35:00,862
In many cases, they don't, but the procedure, which they're following, doesn't call for them to be at 5,000 feet.

377
00:35:00,882 --> 00:35:03,043
It calls for them to climb at a certain rate.

378
00:35:03,384 --> 00:35:04,725
It's 500 feet per nautical mile.

379
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:10,689
We're about six nautical miles from the airport, so if you do the math, they're about three, three and a half thousand feet up.

380
00:35:11,229 --> 00:35:11,910
So it's real loud.

381
00:35:13,352 --> 00:35:14,773
I mentioned the hotline.

382
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:19,436
The hotline's one way to voice your displeasure.

383
00:35:19,496 --> 00:35:23,618
The other way that I find easier is the online form.

384
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:34,545
So you have to kind of, you know, fill out the form, tell them who you are, and then you can go online and, you know, quickly file a complaint if you need to.

385
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:38,922
So the online form is pretty important.

386
00:35:39,702 --> 00:35:44,024
Before I guess I wrap up, there's so much that we could really talk about.

387
00:35:44,245 --> 00:35:50,808
But before I wrap up, prior to 2012, we basically had the same number of airplanes.

388
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:53,769
The number is increasing, and it's going to increase.

389
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:59,632
And when they finish the terminal E modernization, they're going to be bringing on the biggest airplane in the world, the A380.

390
00:36:01,235 --> 00:36:05,296
And that's an intercontinental wide body.

391
00:36:05,316 --> 00:36:06,076
It's a big jet.

392
00:36:07,136 --> 00:36:10,037
And it's going to be flying those Atlantic routes.

393
00:36:10,557 --> 00:36:11,617
So it's going to be taken off at 1030.

394
00:36:11,697 --> 00:36:14,818
And so you're going to have real big planes.

395
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:19,579
You already have real big planes, but you're going to have the biggest plane in the world operating on a Logan.

396
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,879
And that's only going to add to it.

397
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:25,340
So yeah, we're going to see more aircraft.

398
00:36:25,988 --> 00:36:32,814
You know, if you were just to kind of look at it on balance, you know, prior to 2012, you had basically the same number of airplanes.

399
00:36:33,414 --> 00:36:42,261
But because they flew kind of via the beacon system, they would fly to air traffic control towers, basically, and then get redirected to their next tower.

400
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:45,003
And so they'd fly from radar to radar, basically.

401
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:48,686
They had a lot of leeway in what path they could take.

402
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:52,710
And so if you look at the tracks prior to 2013, May of 2013,

403
00:36:55,457 --> 00:36:56,538
They're kind of all over the place.

404
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:58,040
Spaghetti is pretty spread out.

405
00:37:00,262 --> 00:37:05,449
And so 400 planes, but they're spread out, so the noise is shared, and you don't really have a lot of complaints.

406
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:09,654
And if you look at the complaint data, go prior to May 2013, and not even Milton's complaint.

407
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:26,421
But after 2013, when the RNAV points came into force, so the RNAV is a navigation point, and the RNAV point for 33L is actually over Medford.

408
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,583
That's where we get all of it.

409
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:39,213
So every airplane that takes off from the 33L, and on a day where you get a northwest, a north, or a west wind, they're operating on a 33L.

410
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,115
And it's going to be, I think, the worst.

411
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:54,042
If you look at the sort of the complaint history, it starts getting bad in August, and then that continues until about November, and then there's a big drop-off, and it's hardly anything in the winter.

412
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:56,203
And then it kind of builds up again.

413
00:37:56,869 --> 00:38:09,735
So it's pretty cyclical, and from time to time you'll get the northwest wind in the spring, and so you'll get a lot of noise in March, but it won't be over the course of the entire month.

414
00:38:09,975 --> 00:38:10,916
So anyway, prior to 2013,

415
00:38:14,477 --> 00:38:17,358
Everybody's kind of, it's the Wild West sort of thing, you know, they're all spread out.

416
00:38:17,498 --> 00:38:21,739
But after 2013, the RNF point comes in, and it gets real tight.

417
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:26,380
So you get the same number of airplanes, or maybe a few more, but they're all hitting the same spot in the sky.

418
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:41,283
And so now you're getting, you know, residents, hundreds of residents in Medford, Belmont, Cambridge, who see an airplane that's maybe 3,000 feet above their house, you know, every minute and a half, two minutes.

419
00:38:41,843 --> 00:38:48,445
And so that's, you know, that's the kind of like the funneling effect of this RNAV point.

420
00:38:48,685 --> 00:38:55,806
So anyway, to close, the online form, you know, if you want to voice a complaint, probably the quickest way to do it.

421
00:38:56,567 --> 00:39:06,429
And the FAA is not done with NextGen, and now they're going through this feedback period, and they're analyzing metropolises.

422
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,890
and looking at alterations they can make.

423
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:12,091
And so San Francisco is getting some changes.

424
00:39:12,111 --> 00:39:13,412
This is a big national problem.

425
00:39:13,432 --> 00:39:14,372
It's not like a Medford problem.

426
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:15,173
It's a national problem.

427
00:39:15,473 --> 00:39:20,675
And the FAA is working on it, as far as they'll lead you to believe.

428
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:24,757
And Logan is going to be studied next.

429
00:39:25,098 --> 00:39:31,481
So if you want it to change, one of the pieces of data they look at are complaints.

430
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:35,903
And number of callers, not just number of complaints, because again, in Milton, they have like 4,000 complaints.

431
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:42,176
But some of those people are filing hundreds of complaints, clearly, if you just do the math.

432
00:39:43,037 --> 00:39:45,658
So it's complaints, but it's also number of callers.

433
00:39:45,979 --> 00:39:50,561
If you don't like it, file the complaint, because they are going to look at the data.

434
00:39:51,062 --> 00:39:53,923
And there is a process to kind of remediate.

435
00:39:54,824 --> 00:39:56,585
And that's ongoing.

436
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:58,526
So that's all I have to say.

437
00:39:58,846 --> 00:40:02,729
And I want to say thanks for bringing this up, because it is a public concern.

438
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:03,990
It's a quality of life issue.

439
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,051
And it certainly affects everyone that lives

440
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:10,812
in Medford, and especially I think in this area, because they fly right over McNally.

441
00:40:10,832 --> 00:40:11,513
Thanks a lot.

442
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:21,956
groups that you refer to.

443
00:40:21,976 --> 00:40:28,999
I didn't catch the Boston... Oh, the first is... The one that's kind of local to us would be Boston West Fair Skies.

444
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:30,899
West Fair Skies?

445
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:39,563
Yeah, they're all separate words and they have a nice webpage, a lot of sort of visualizations of data that's been collected.

446
00:40:39,663 --> 00:40:41,644
It's informative.

447
00:40:41,764 --> 00:40:43,044
So I'd recommend seeing that one.

448
00:40:43,104 --> 00:40:48,587
And the other one that kind of caters to the southern communities, I think is Boston Fair Skies.

449
00:40:51,828 --> 00:41:17,882
Thank you very much on the motion for approval as amended all those in favor all those 16-5 74 communications from the mayor to the president and members of the honorable method City Council from Mayor Stephanie M Burke re amendment to chapter 26 entitled education of the revised ordinances of the city of Medford

450
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:21,004
pertaining to accountability of universities and colleges.

451
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:33,329
Dear Mr. President and members of the Medford City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following amendment to chapter 26 of the revised ordinance of the city of Medford.

452
00:41:33,889 --> 00:41:40,472
This amendment will assist the city to better address the myriad of issues that arrive when students live off campus.

453
00:41:41,152 --> 00:41:46,634
Specifically, it provides a mechanism through which post-secondary schools within the city

454
00:41:47,068 --> 00:41:52,875
will collect and maintain records of their locally residing off campus student population.

455
00:41:53,656 --> 00:42:06,230
This will assist the city to better provide security and regulatory enforcement services for the off campus student population and to the residents of the city in general.

456
00:42:07,315 --> 00:42:10,096
The full text of the proposed amendment follows.

457
00:42:10,656 --> 00:42:15,517
Sincerely yours, signature on file, Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor.

458
00:42:16,197 --> 00:42:17,978
Somebody please stop me from reading this.

459
00:42:18,778 --> 00:42:35,343
An ordinance amending chapter 26 entitled education of the revi- On the motion of Councilor Knight that I stop reading and invite the city solicitor up to read to us a synopsis of the full text.

460
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:42,801
I'll do my best.

461
00:42:46,624 --> 00:42:54,389
All right, the synopsis is that this would be an amendment which would go into the ordinances under the section of the ordinances that deals with education.

462
00:42:55,089 --> 00:43:03,995
The reason that that was chosen is that it really wouldn't fit well into zoning, and there's only one other chapter in education, so this one seemed to fit.

463
00:43:04,475 --> 00:43:11,320
The first section, which is 2641, is definitional, lays out the definition of campus, city, directory, school, and student.

464
00:43:12,101 --> 00:43:13,895
And the purpose of this is that.

465
00:43:14,629 --> 00:43:18,450
students on campuses at universities and colleges.

466
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,171
Some live on campus and some live off campus.

467
00:43:22,631 --> 00:43:32,094
And it would be good, without disclosing the identity of those who live off campus, to maintain records of those who live off campus locally.

468
00:43:33,294 --> 00:43:42,977
And then we get to the meat of it, which says that every school in any part of the city shall collect and maintain a directory of names, addresses, et cetera, of undergraduate, graduate,

469
00:43:43,397 --> 00:43:47,942
full and part-time students with their graduation dates, telephone numbers, and roles at the school.

470
00:43:48,522 --> 00:43:55,609
In addition to collect and maintain a list of properties currently owned, leased, rented, or operated for use as student residences.

471
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:07,341
And the addresses, telephone numbers collected for these purposes would reflect where the student actually resides locally and what telephone number the student can be reached at for a period of time that they reside in the city.

472
00:44:08,035 --> 00:44:12,397
And then the school would be required to maintain a directory of this information.

473
00:44:12,957 --> 00:44:21,400
And no less than twice a year, the school would collect the required directory information, and no later than 30 days following the first day of each semester.

474
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:32,024
And any school on a quarterly system shall collect the data itself no later than 30 days following the first day of the first quarter of each academic year.

475
00:44:32,324 --> 00:44:34,625
I'm sorry to have gone through the timeframe so quickly.

476
00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:38,382
But I just wanted to give you, it can be read just as easily as said.

477
00:44:38,902 --> 00:44:50,391
And then upon collection of all of the information, the directory shall be organized and maintained by the school so that the information is accessible and understandable to any authorized school official.

478
00:44:51,052 --> 00:44:54,815
And the school shall be responsible for publicizing to their students

479
00:44:55,278 --> 00:45:02,525
The limitations on the city zoning ordinance, which limits occupancy to not more than three unrelated adults.

480
00:45:02,565 --> 00:45:08,130
And then there's a footnote, which has the lodging house definition from our ordinances.

481
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,172
Then, section 2644.

482
00:45:11,833 --> 00:45:16,314
has the substance of the report and the statistics that have to be compiled.

483
00:45:17,054 --> 00:45:19,055
There's a time frame in the first paragraph.

484
00:45:19,075 --> 00:45:25,536
The information in the report shall be compiled by the school within 45 calendar days at the beginning of each semester or quarter.

485
00:45:25,936 --> 00:45:34,018
And the report shall include, but not be limited to, the total number of students enrolled at the school as of the date of the collection of the information.

486
00:45:34,415 --> 00:46:03,901
total number of students enrolled at the school who reside on the campus, total number of students enrolled at the school who reside off-campus, and an anonymous breakdown of the number of students enrolled at the school as of the data collection of the directory information that reside off-campus of the school organized by address and unit number, including zip code, student status, that is, whether undergraduate, graduate, part-time, or full-time, expected graduation date, et cetera, and whether or not the property is owned, leased, rented, or operated by

487
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:07,936
the school, the home of a family member, or other private housing.

488
00:46:08,377 --> 00:46:15,762
Then a complete list of the addresses of all properties currently owned, leased, or rented, operated by the school at which students are housed.

489
00:46:16,202 --> 00:46:18,183
And then there's more time frames involved here.

490
00:46:18,223 --> 00:46:21,946
Every school shall forward within 45 calendar days at the beginning of the semester or quarter.

491
00:46:22,386 --> 00:46:23,827
That information that is gathered

492
00:46:24,728 --> 00:46:33,954
in the report required by the section to the city clerk who shall forward the report to the mayor of the city and the superintendent of the Office of Inspectional Services.

493
00:46:34,355 --> 00:46:36,296
In our case, that would be the building commissioner.

494
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,059
That probably should say building commissioner.

495
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,760
I think that would be clear.

496
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:49,106
I beg the indulgence of the council if this is going to be favorably looked at to say the office of the building commissioner.

497
00:46:49,566 --> 00:46:53,069
The clerk shall also docket the report and include in the docket the agenda of the next

498
00:46:53,905 --> 00:46:55,789
at the next occurring meeting of the city council.

499
00:46:56,190 --> 00:47:02,141
The failure or the refusal of the school to forward the report shall be noncompliance with the provisions of these sections.

500
00:47:02,182 --> 00:47:05,628
And if they do, then under the next section, which

501
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:12,562
probably should be 2645, so I asked for another amendment on that.

502
00:47:13,242 --> 00:47:17,504
And that 7155 came from another place, which I can explain.

503
00:47:17,885 --> 00:47:21,146
Here are the penalties if they fail to comply.

504
00:47:21,186 --> 00:47:22,787
There's a non-criminal disposition.

505
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:30,851
And if necessary, the city can consider each offense a separate and distinct offense.

506
00:47:31,151 --> 00:47:33,172
And there's nothing which precludes the city

507
00:47:34,565 --> 00:47:38,788
from instituting any other remedies to abate violations of this ordinance.

508
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:47,254
So there's a couple of amendments that are necessary to clean that up, just eyeballing the, or reviewing the data in the proposed ordinance.

509
00:47:48,655 --> 00:47:49,195
Mr. President.

510
00:47:49,656 --> 00:47:54,579
Mr. President, a motion to amend the paper before us in the second to last paragraph and the second to last sentence.

511
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:59,883
We'd like to strike the word superintendent of the office of inspectional services and replace that with the building inspector.

512
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:05,180
We also have, uh, an amendment that I'd like to propose.

513
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,764
Mr. President, uh, it would read section point, uh, section seven dash one, five, five violations.

514
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:15,328
I'd like to strike section seven dash one, five, five, and replace that with two six dash four or five.

515
00:48:15,368 --> 00:48:22,153
Mr. President, as amended by councilor night, Mr. President, this is an excellent measure that's brought forward by the mayor.

516
00:48:22,494 --> 00:48:29,299
Um, this is a piece of legislation that mirrors that, uh, that was being discussed in the subcommittee of zoning and ordinances.

517
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:36,579
that came off the heels of a council resolution that was passed to establish what would be called a university accountability ordinance.

518
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:39,383
In reading the language in this document here,

519
00:48:39,773 --> 00:48:45,936
It mirrors the language of the City of Boston's University Accountability Ordinance as well as that of the City of Somerville.

520
00:48:46,516 --> 00:48:48,937
It seems to have worked in those communities rather well, Mr. President.

521
00:48:49,858 --> 00:49:06,585
In my review of the matter, you know, it's virtually identical to those two other pieces of legislations in neighboring communities with the exception of some housekeeping matters that would make it reflective for Medfit as opposed to Boston or Somerville or any other community for that matter.

522
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:10,144
But this is a measure that I wholeheartedly support, 110%, Mr. President.

523
00:49:10,184 --> 00:49:16,428
I'd move for approval on it, and I'd ask that the body here support this measure and that the vote be taken by a call of the yeas and nays.

524
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:17,909
Very good.

525
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:22,152
The motion for approval as amended by Councilor Knight.

526
00:49:22,572 --> 00:49:29,317
Yet another shining example of the city's administration responding to the request of the council.

527
00:49:29,797 --> 00:49:30,818
Vice President Longo, currently.

528
00:49:31,063 --> 00:49:32,584
Thank you, President De La Russo.

529
00:49:32,664 --> 00:49:35,085
I just want to second the motion for approval.

530
00:49:35,485 --> 00:49:42,148
This is something that we began talking about right after John Bavuso got on board, I believe, eight years ago.

531
00:49:42,228 --> 00:49:44,209
And it's something that, you know, never came to fruition.

532
00:49:44,249 --> 00:49:48,891
So I want to thank the administration and the mayor's office for pushing this forward.

533
00:49:48,931 --> 00:49:58,316
I think it's definitely something that is going to be very helpful to not only our police department, but fire department, as well as our code enforcement officer, who

534
00:49:59,168 --> 00:50:22,683
When we started talking about it, I believe there was an issue, a few residents were here with regards to, I think, complaints about a couple of parties at the end of the year, and they got out of hand, and they were just, I don't know, I can't recall it exactly, it was about, like I said, probably about eight years ago, so this is something that definitely will help the city of Medford, and I appreciate the administration moving it forward.

535
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:28,971
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

536
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:30,392
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

537
00:50:30,573 --> 00:50:31,573
Thank you, Mr. President.

538
00:50:31,774 --> 00:50:40,101
And, you know, I had the opportunity to read over the proposed ordinance, and I think it has a lot of merit.

539
00:50:40,521 --> 00:50:44,044
However, you know, we are the legislative body in this community.

540
00:50:44,524 --> 00:50:47,527
This is two and a half pages of city ordinance.

541
00:50:48,308 --> 00:50:54,553
And even though it may mirror Boston and Somerville, I think it needs to be vetted out within our community, you know,

542
00:50:55,713 --> 00:51:07,281
This is a great way of enforcing occupancy restrictions, which is the restriction that we have no more than three unrelated people living in a dwelling.

543
00:51:07,881 --> 00:51:13,205
And I think this would go a long way in assisting the concerns we have with that.

544
00:51:13,605 --> 00:51:20,290
However, if you look at the city of Boston, their code enforcement department doesn't consist of two people.

545
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,311
If you look at the city of Somerville,

546
00:51:23,026 --> 00:51:26,087
Their code enforcement department doesn't consist of two people.

547
00:51:26,828 --> 00:51:29,269
So, you know, I think we have to vet this out.

548
00:51:29,689 --> 00:51:32,230
I think we have to make it realistic for our community.

549
00:51:33,171 --> 00:51:40,494
The one concern I do have is that when we do get the names, I'm sorry, not the names, strike that, not the names.

550
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:46,717
When we do get the addresses eventually from the educational institutions in our community,

551
00:51:47,468 --> 00:51:49,410
That puts this city on notice.

552
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:57,616
So if we get 80 different addresses saying, you know, there's six people living at each address, we're on notice as a community.

553
00:51:57,977 --> 00:52:07,264
And go off a bit, something happens in one of those apartments, and the city of Meffitt doesn't reach out and do their due diligence on that, that may be a concern.

554
00:52:07,945 --> 00:52:16,432
And I'm just saying, I think we have to vet this out, maybe even look at language that states, once we receive the reports from the educational institutions,

555
00:52:16,887 --> 00:52:33,571
that the city method is required to act on anything that is in direct conflict with the enforcement restrictions within our community that currently exist.

556
00:52:33,891 --> 00:52:36,632
They have to act within 30 days or whatever it might be.

557
00:52:37,505 --> 00:52:42,727
to just put this through, you know, without any vetting process.

558
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:46,688
I think this belongs in the ad hoc education subcommittee.

559
00:52:47,468 --> 00:52:48,309
Let them vet it out.

560
00:52:48,509 --> 00:52:49,569
Let them take a look at it.

561
00:52:52,670 --> 00:53:01,873
I believe the paper is already lying in the zoning and ordinance subcommittee right now, and we did have one meeting on it previously, just in terms of procedural history of the paper.

562
00:53:03,814 --> 00:53:06,835
Right, so the paper came from the mayor's office, not from the subcommittee.

563
00:53:10,154 --> 00:53:13,437
I file the resolution, I attach language.

564
00:53:14,477 --> 00:53:17,880
The same concerns that you raised that night, that you're raising tonight were raised that night.

565
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,080
The matter was sent to subcommittee.

566
00:53:19,401 --> 00:53:23,724
The subcommittee met on two or three occasions at this point in time to take up this paper as well as other papers.

567
00:53:24,304 --> 00:53:27,086
We discussed the paper not in its full length or entirety.

568
00:53:27,807 --> 00:53:34,071
The language that was submitted by the administration mirrored the exact language that I was looking at when I was putting it together.

569
00:53:34,941 --> 00:53:38,902
as the sponsor of the resolution and the proposed ordinance change.

570
00:53:39,742 --> 00:53:48,664
So I can understand where you're coming from, and I'm sure you can understand where I'm coming from, and I'm very happy to see the language be pretty much virtually the exact same language that I was proposing at the subcommittee level.

571
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:51,904
However, I feel as though this is a great measure, Counselor.

572
00:53:51,924 --> 00:53:52,845
I don't want to stop you further.

573
00:53:52,865 --> 00:53:56,745
I just wanted to give you procedural history as to where we were and where it came from.

574
00:53:56,785 --> 00:53:58,726
But I put a measure forward.

575
00:54:00,128 --> 00:54:02,069
voted to put it into subcommittee to draft something.

576
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:03,350
Something was drafted.

577
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:05,311
The vetting process was ongoing.

578
00:54:05,592 --> 00:54:08,554
The paper was never reported out of committee in the interim.

579
00:54:08,714 --> 00:54:11,315
The administration has put an identical paper forward.

580
00:54:12,396 --> 00:54:12,816
Okay.

581
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:16,939
So I can appreciate that, but that came from the administration and that's fine.

582
00:54:16,959 --> 00:54:21,782
They're, they're able to submit a request for a ordinances anytime.

583
00:54:21,802 --> 00:54:22,903
And they've done that in the past.

584
00:54:23,443 --> 00:54:28,827
Uh, the committee that council might is, uh, talking about the subcommittee, that paper is still before the subcommittee.

585
00:54:29,394 --> 00:54:32,479
It seems like it was partially vetted out, never reported out.

586
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,023
So that's not the paper that's currently before us.

587
00:54:35,464 --> 00:54:36,946
This paper is from the administration.

588
00:54:37,387 --> 00:54:38,989
So if the council wants to go on record.

589
00:54:39,373 --> 00:54:44,816
without vetting out ordinances, which is one of our main responsibilities, then so be it.

590
00:54:44,876 --> 00:54:56,461
It's not going to have my stamp of approval on it, because as I just mentioned, there's some concerns within the language that I have that may not be concerns in Somerville and Boston, who have an ample code enforcement department.

591
00:54:56,881 --> 00:54:58,842
We all know in this community, we don't.

592
00:54:59,643 --> 00:55:06,446
And so for those reasons, Mr. President, I couldn't support it unless it's fully vetted out in subcommittee, and I would recommend

593
00:55:07,193 --> 00:55:17,777
that this be sent to the ad hoc education committee where the good attorney mentioned that he found the appropriate place within our ordinances under the education section of it.

594
00:55:17,857 --> 00:55:28,481
So, that would be my recommendation, you know, to have it fully vetted out where it is the jurisdiction of this council to enact ordinances.

595
00:55:28,961 --> 00:55:35,483
We have a motion for approval and yours, counselor, is contradictory to that motion.

596
00:55:36,022 --> 00:55:40,723
So on the motion for approval, was that an amendment to the motion?

597
00:55:41,063 --> 00:55:42,744
Well, if he wants, we'll take a vote on that.

598
00:55:42,764 --> 00:55:43,644
I'm voting against it.

599
00:55:43,664 --> 00:55:44,824
So if it dies, it dies.

600
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:47,045
And I'd rather see it not die.

601
00:55:47,065 --> 00:55:48,405
I'd rather see it go to a subcommittee.

602
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:50,086
I'm supportive of this.

603
00:55:52,006 --> 00:55:55,547
I'm supportive of this, Mr. President, but I think it has to be vetted out.

604
00:55:55,627 --> 00:56:01,849
I think we have to do our homework and not just get a two and a half page ordinance from the mayor's office and report it out.

605
00:56:01,889 --> 00:56:03,689
We just got this language Friday.

606
00:56:04,682 --> 00:56:10,305
So if my council colleagues feel comfortable with language without looking at it, I'm sure Congress doesn't do it that way.

607
00:56:10,345 --> 00:56:15,827
I'm sure the state legislature doesn't do it that way, but if the city council wants to do it that way, then so be it.

608
00:56:17,868 --> 00:56:21,250
Uh, the, uh, if we could allow the solicitor to, uh,

609
00:56:21,588 --> 00:56:23,108
Perhaps she has some information.

610
00:56:23,509 --> 00:56:24,509
Please, just briefly.

611
00:56:24,629 --> 00:56:28,430
I'm sure Congress doesn't do things that way because we've all seen how they operate.

612
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:37,713
But wherever it goes, wherever it came from, however legislatively it's handled, as long as it's moved forward, I think that's the most important thing.

613
00:56:37,753 --> 00:56:40,293
Because when the question comes up, where did it come from?

614
00:56:40,673 --> 00:56:41,934
Did it come from a subcommittee?

615
00:56:42,334 --> 00:56:43,934
Did it come from the mayor?

616
00:56:43,974 --> 00:56:45,055
Did it come from Boston?

617
00:56:45,075 --> 00:56:46,655
Did it come from another city in town?

618
00:56:47,255 --> 00:56:49,376
Obviously, this is the mayor's proposal tonight.

619
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:52,622
And wherever it came from, it came from concern.

620
00:56:53,863 --> 00:56:58,406
I don't want to wax on about something, but I have to say this right now at this juncture.

621
00:56:59,147 --> 00:57:02,809
Having been in the law department for 32 years, I've seen a lot of different things.

622
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:08,073
And some things that are very hard and some things that are heinous.

623
00:57:08,753 --> 00:57:14,998
And you may recall, because some of the counselors were around then, I think, but the Harris Road fire.

624
00:57:15,881 --> 00:57:22,145
about 14 years ago, 15 years ago, where a college student at Tufts died in the fire.

625
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:28,729
And it was a place that was, as many times it occurs, it was a place that was being rented to too many students.

626
00:57:29,669 --> 00:57:43,798
And so after that, we tried to enact an ordinance which would have dealt with home inspections of three or more so that we could make sure that if there were going to be these absentee landlords that were going to stuff students in there, we could try to get at it early.

627
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:53,179
And the objections that came forth from the landlord lobbyist group, state group that came here into these chambers and fought against that.

628
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:55,962
And I don't think any of the councilors were here then who are wrong now.

629
00:57:56,423 --> 00:57:57,745
And that measure was defeated.

630
00:57:59,247 --> 00:58:14,211
Having been through that experience, having spoken to that young girl's family, and also having the city of Medford entered suit against that homeowner who rented that out to recover at least our response time to police and fire.

631
00:58:14,771 --> 00:58:16,691
And I wish that we had never been able to do that.

632
00:58:16,711 --> 00:58:20,332
I wish that the girl had never had this happen to her, that her life wasn't cut short.

633
00:58:21,112 --> 00:58:24,073
Wherever this goes from here tonight, that's your business.

634
00:58:24,693 --> 00:58:27,814
But the basis and the foundation of this ordinance is concerned.

635
00:58:28,245 --> 00:58:30,907
And it isn't just concern to stop college parties.

636
00:58:31,487 --> 00:58:36,530
It's a concern to make sure that youngsters who live off campus are safe.

637
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:39,472
So wherever you send it, send it.

638
00:58:39,692 --> 00:58:45,175
And I know, I have no doubt that every one of you counselors have the same concerns that I do.

639
00:58:45,615 --> 00:58:49,418
So where it goes is less important than it gets moved forward.

640
00:58:50,238 --> 00:58:56,163
And no one would ever be against appropriate view and review in depth of any ordinance.

641
00:58:56,223 --> 00:58:57,644
I don't take any exception to that.

642
00:58:57,945 --> 00:58:59,246
And I wasn't the author of this.

643
00:58:59,746 --> 00:59:04,871
The reason that there were those two errors on there was I wanted to get it done and I overlooked those numbers at the end.

644
00:59:05,511 --> 00:59:11,376
But wherever you send it, as long as it's moving forward, that we're doing something positive, then I feel better.

645
00:59:11,416 --> 00:59:15,840
And I think that it's a tribute to this council to address the same concerns that came up

646
00:59:16,342 --> 00:59:20,886
when that young college student's life was shortened in that fire at Harris Road 14 years ago.

647
00:59:24,469 --> 00:59:25,050
Councillor Knight.

648
00:59:27,652 --> 00:59:29,874
My concern is that it does keep moving forward, Mr. President.

649
00:59:29,914 --> 00:59:32,116
I think Councillor Lungo said it best.

650
00:59:32,196 --> 00:59:33,297
It's been eight years in the making.

651
00:59:35,077 --> 00:59:38,238
We've had no proposed legislation that's been before the body.

652
00:59:38,298 --> 00:59:38,718
Now we do.

653
00:59:39,798 --> 00:59:40,538
I took a shot at it.

654
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:42,259
I put some proposed legislation together.

655
00:59:42,299 --> 00:59:45,640
I sent it into our subcommittee for review and for vetting.

656
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,181
I'd be willing to withdraw my motion.

657
00:59:51,941 --> 00:59:54,382
Just if I could, and I respect the fact that you took a shot at it.

658
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:58,622
The only shot that the administration did was to copy an ordinance from Somerville.

659
00:59:59,302 --> 01:00:00,984
I mean, it doesn't take much of a shot to do that.

660
01:00:01,104 --> 01:00:02,285
Let me finish what I was going to say.

661
01:00:02,305 --> 01:00:03,146
I know, but I'm just saying.

662
01:00:03,186 --> 01:00:06,989
So to have it vetted out, I don't think is a big concern to vet this out.

663
01:00:07,009 --> 01:00:08,490
And I'm not saying it is, Councillor.

664
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:16,376
What I'm saying is this, what I'm saying is I'd be happy to withdraw my motion, but whereas the zoning and ordinance subcommittee has already met on it, I think it would make sense that it would remain in that subcommittee.

665
01:00:16,757 --> 01:00:22,642
That's all.

666
01:00:23,182 --> 01:00:24,243
If they were unable to,

667
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:28,218
get this moving forward, then maybe it deserves another subcommittee.

668
01:00:28,998 --> 01:00:32,601
And that's no reflection on the members, but maybe it deserves another subcommittee.

669
01:00:39,117 --> 01:00:41,118
safe access to medicinal marijuana facilities.

670
01:00:41,918 --> 01:00:43,258
And you guys are still busy with that.

671
01:00:43,298 --> 01:00:43,778
Yes, we are.

672
01:00:43,818 --> 01:00:44,058
Right.

673
01:00:44,198 --> 01:00:46,179
So maybe another subcommittee may be a good idea.

674
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:48,820
Maybe you guys are maybe overworked and underpaid.

675
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:57,942
I would respectfully ask that it be sent to the ad hoc education committee where that's where it falls within the city ordinance, Mr. President.

676
01:00:58,142 --> 01:00:59,303
And I appreciate my calling.

677
01:00:59,463 --> 01:01:00,843
I'm not trying to hold this up.

678
01:01:00,963 --> 01:01:03,364
I think this is a good idea, but it needs to be vetted.

679
01:01:03,384 --> 01:01:07,585
Do you still have your motion?

680
01:01:08,072 --> 01:01:09,833
to send it, no, for approval to my first reading.

681
01:01:09,853 --> 01:01:11,835
I have a motion for approval on the floor, Mr. President.

682
01:01:12,035 --> 01:01:13,796
I have no problem withdrawing that motion.

683
01:01:13,856 --> 01:01:16,178
If somebody else wants it to go forward, then they can make the motion.

684
01:01:16,238 --> 01:01:22,322
But I made the motion right out of the gate because it was something that I feel passionate about that I think it's a piece of legislation.

685
01:01:22,422 --> 01:01:23,043
I made a motion.

686
01:01:23,163 --> 01:01:25,204
I made a motion to send it to the subcommittee.

687
01:01:25,485 --> 01:01:26,405
Right.

688
01:01:26,445 --> 01:01:28,987
I made the motion right when I spoke, and I spoke first.

689
01:01:29,007 --> 01:01:30,388
So I'm saying I made the motion right out of the gate.

690
01:01:30,408 --> 01:01:32,570
I'll withdraw my motion and let everybody else say what they think about it.

691
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:33,190
I have no problem with that.

692
01:01:33,210 --> 01:01:36,773
So the chair has the motion of council night withdrawn.

693
01:01:37,413 --> 01:01:47,137
And the motion on the floor is the motion of Councilor Marks to send it to the Zoning and Ordinance Subcommittee Council.

694
01:01:48,197 --> 01:01:54,239
The ad hoc committee of education, which I think was created by Councilor DelaRusso, if I'm not mistaken.

695
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,320
Yes, thank you.

696
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:00,062
So on the motion of Councilor Marks, Mr. Citizen, please.

697
01:02:01,242 --> 01:02:02,242
Please state your name and address.

698
01:02:02,262 --> 01:02:04,503
Thank you, Mr. Castaneri, Cushing Street, 02155.

699
01:02:10,764 --> 01:02:16,589
Um, this ordinance, I haven't had a chance to read it in total.

700
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:24,175
It seems that applies to any present campus or any future new campus that may establish here.

701
01:02:24,235 --> 01:02:25,476
Notes one five five.

702
01:02:27,017 --> 01:02:34,123
Also it reads campus means any real property owned by a school.

703
01:02:35,564 --> 01:02:39,588
So my question is, does this ordinance,

704
01:02:41,393 --> 01:03:01,039
include Walnut Hill properties or any other entity that buys housing, real estate in Medford for any method college or any entity in the future under the guise of under the wing of any local university.

705
01:03:01,539 --> 01:03:02,480
That's very important.

706
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:09,702
I would think to have your language set and contract if you pass this and studying is a lot better than making

707
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:11,333
a possible mistake.

708
01:03:12,514 --> 01:03:14,635
Worthy notion for consideration.

709
01:03:14,655 --> 01:03:24,278
So on the motion for this ordinance draft to be sent to the committee, the Ad Hoc Committee for Education, all those in favor?

710
01:03:24,578 --> 01:03:25,879
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

711
01:03:25,959 --> 01:03:26,279
I'm sorry.

712
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:27,539
Thank you, Mr. President.

713
01:03:28,359 --> 01:03:37,963
When this goes to the committee, I would request that a representative from Tufts University be invited to that meeting also, seeing that this is pretty much pertinent to them.

714
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:45,973
The chairman of the committee is Councillor Falco, supported by Vice President Longo-Curran and Councillor Scarpelli.

715
01:03:46,553 --> 01:03:50,816
So on the motion as amended, Councillor Knight?

716
01:03:51,277 --> 01:03:51,677
No, that's it.

717
01:03:51,917 --> 01:03:52,618
That's all set.

718
01:03:52,658 --> 01:03:53,218
Councillor Marks?

719
01:03:53,558 --> 01:03:56,300
Just if I could, Mr. Castaneda, you asked a great question.

720
01:03:56,921 --> 01:03:58,002
And if you look at section 26-44,

721
01:04:00,014 --> 01:04:07,458
It applies to property owned, leased, rented, or operated by the school, the home of a family member, or other private housing.

722
01:04:07,618 --> 01:04:10,040
So in my opinion, it applies to everyone.

723
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:14,822
So I think it's covered within this current ordinance.

724
01:04:15,543 --> 01:04:16,803
And maybe the city solicitor.

725
01:04:17,263 --> 01:04:21,186
Oh, no, no.

726
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:22,306
The motion for approval.

727
01:04:22,406 --> 01:04:23,287
All those in favor?

728
01:04:24,938 --> 01:04:25,759
All those opposed?

729
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,281
Motion carries.

730
01:04:29,162 --> 01:04:34,306
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight for suspension of the rules to take a paper off the table.

731
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:35,307
Councilor Knight.

732
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:40,711
Which paper are we taking off the table, Mr. President?

733
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:46,076
I think maybe the budget might be a good one to take up off the table at this point in time.

734
01:04:46,376 --> 01:04:47,617
Yes, 16-533, Mr. Councilor.

735
01:04:47,637 --> 01:04:48,818
16-533, the FY 2017 Municipal and School Budget.

736
01:04:52,475 --> 01:04:54,355
to take the school budget off the table.

737
01:04:54,415 --> 01:04:55,296
All those in favor?

738
01:04:55,316 --> 01:04:57,756
Councilor?

739
01:04:57,976 --> 01:04:58,216
Okay.

740
01:04:58,276 --> 01:05:00,597
Paper in the hands of the clerk.

741
01:05:21,473 --> 01:05:29,679
Offered by Councilor Knight, be resolved that the administration take the proper measures to increase the number of no heavy trucking signs along Golden Ave.

742
01:05:29,719 --> 01:05:30,360
Councilor Knight.

743
01:05:31,421 --> 01:05:32,842
Yes, Mr. President.

744
01:05:32,902 --> 01:05:38,046
Before we walked into our meeting this afternoon at 7 p.m., there was a Zoning Board of Appeals meeting going on.

745
01:05:38,266 --> 01:05:43,230
And one of the items in discussion was the development of a property on Golden Ave.

746
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:46,072
The Zoning Board of Appeals has purview on that.

747
01:05:46,662 --> 01:05:54,126
However, there were some individuals that resided on Golden Ave that did have some concerns about the increase in volume of heavy trucking up their street.

748
01:05:54,186 --> 01:05:56,047
Golden Ave is a notorious cut through street.

749
01:05:56,307 --> 01:06:05,733
I think we've all seen people take a right-hand turn on Mystic Ave from Harvard and then their shop left at Enterprise Towing up Golden Ave and then they keep going all the way up.

750
01:06:06,273 --> 01:06:08,454
And I think for those who didn't know the shortcut, I just told them.

751
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:15,142
how to do it, but ultimately, Mr. President, the road's seeing a large amount of increase in traffic, especially in heavy trucks.

752
01:06:15,182 --> 01:06:19,124
Heavy trucking is prohibited on the street, so I'm asking that the administration take the appropriate steps.

753
01:06:19,144 --> 01:06:20,465
The motion is approved by Councilor Knight.

754
01:06:20,485 --> 01:06:21,125
All those in favor?

755
01:06:21,145 --> 01:06:21,705
All those opposed?

756
01:06:21,725 --> 01:06:22,366
Motion carries.

757
01:06:22,846 --> 01:06:33,332
Offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the administration provide an update on the status of the requested painting and installation of a crosswalk between King Avenue and Cedar Road, Councilor Knight, and Forest Street.

758
01:06:33,873 --> 01:06:55,074
Yes, Mr. President, upon the grand opening of McNally Park, I put a resolution in requesting that a crosswalk be erected so that residents who would like to walk to the park would be able to cross safely because the nearest crosswalk is either at the foot of Forrest and Salem or at Governors Lawrence and Forrest, Mr. President, so this would make it closer to the park.

759
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:56,956
On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

760
01:06:58,346 --> 01:07:06,331
Motion carries off it by Council Caviello be resolved that the Metro City Council request that the DPW repair the pothole on the corner of Evans and Central.

761
01:07:06,651 --> 01:07:07,552
Councilor Caviello.

762
01:07:07,932 --> 01:07:08,612
Thank you, Mr. President.

763
01:07:08,672 --> 01:07:15,877
Mr. President, I was informed by a resident this evening that some of the potholes on Evans Street have been fixed, but there was one remaining.

764
01:07:16,448 --> 01:07:19,949
If the DPW can go out there and fill the one last hole, we'd appreciate it, Mr. President.

765
01:07:20,089 --> 01:07:21,649
On motion approved by Councilor Caviello.

766
01:07:21,689 --> 01:07:22,269
All those in favor?

767
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:23,070
All those opposed?

768
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:23,430
Carries.

769
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:26,770
Offered by Councilors Caviello, Scarpelli, and DelaRusso.

770
01:07:26,790 --> 01:07:34,052
Be it resolved that the Manhattan City Council request that Winthrop Street resurfacing from Playstead Road to Lawrence be discussed.

771
01:07:34,392 --> 01:07:35,273
Councilor Caviello.

772
01:07:35,453 --> 01:07:36,173
Thank you, Mr. President.

773
01:07:36,253 --> 01:07:42,294
Mr. President, again, I think we've all received the same email in regards to Winthrop Street.

774
01:07:42,914 --> 01:07:45,635
And most of that street has been repaved.

775
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:49,240
That is the only section left of the street that has not been paved.

776
01:07:49,281 --> 01:07:53,002
The hillside part has been, all the other parts of the circle have been.

777
01:07:53,863 --> 01:08:02,467
If we could request that the administration look at to possibly resurfacing that section from Placestead Road down to Lawrence Road, it would be appreciated, Mr. President.

778
01:08:02,967 --> 01:08:03,867
Let's get it done.

779
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,048
On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

780
01:08:06,088 --> 01:08:06,829
All those in favor?

781
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:07,489
Councilor Marks?

782
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:12,271
I don't want to be the shark at the pool party, but

783
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:22,796
Eversource will be digging that street up, as we all know, in 2017, from Winchester all the way down Winthrop Street, the whole length of Winthrop Street.

784
01:08:22,836 --> 01:08:23,977
To Somerville.

785
01:08:24,197 --> 01:08:24,557
Correct.

786
01:08:24,617 --> 01:08:30,461
They're going to be digging a trench, and then they're going to be digging 10-foot manholes every certain distance.

787
01:08:31,182 --> 01:08:43,270
And I did respond back to the resident, who I know well, and I explained that situation, that it doesn't make sense to resurface that large of an area where it's going to be dug up in maybe eight months from now.

788
01:08:44,593 --> 01:08:57,523
And I explained that some of the issues that they were having was regarding heavy trucking and some of the gullies and so forth on that end of Winthrop Street because of the construction of new homes down there.

789
01:08:58,103 --> 01:09:09,972
And I think that's a better recommendation at this particular point to have the engineering department go out, check the road from the Winchester line all the way up to Lawrence Road

790
01:09:11,512 --> 01:09:28,565
and see what recommendations they have of temporary fixes, Mr. President, before we can have, because that road's going to be resurfaced 100% after that work is done in 2017 from Eversource, that's installing an electricity line.

791
01:09:29,026 --> 01:09:30,907
So that would be my recommendation.

792
01:09:30,927 --> 01:09:35,311
I mean, I'll support either one, but I don't think that road's going to be resurfaced.

793
01:09:36,151 --> 01:09:39,514
On the motion for approval as amended by Councilor Marks, all those in favor?

794
01:09:39,941 --> 01:09:41,602
All those opposed, the motion carries.

795
01:09:42,222 --> 01:09:50,486
Offered by Councilor Caravello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the electrical department replace the broken lights at the War Memorial Park.

796
01:09:50,706 --> 01:09:54,068
Currently, four lights on the ground are not working.

797
01:09:54,188 --> 01:09:55,008
Councilor Caravello.

798
01:09:55,088 --> 01:09:56,148
Thank you, Mr. President.

799
01:09:56,649 --> 01:10:01,211
A couple of veterans approached me in the last couple of days in regards to the lights being out.

800
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:08,074
They're the ones that are on the ground, and I think I may have requested this a couple of months ago also.

801
01:10:08,676 --> 01:10:13,497
But now there are four lights out, so if they could be changed, it would be greatly appreciated.

802
01:10:13,517 --> 01:10:15,097
The veterans would appreciate it.

803
01:10:15,437 --> 01:10:17,818
On the motion approved by Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

804
01:10:17,858 --> 01:10:18,478
All those opposed?

805
01:10:18,538 --> 01:10:19,158
Motion carries.

806
01:10:19,598 --> 01:10:31,440
Offered by President DelaRusso, be it resolved that the Medford City Council commit and congratulate Jeopardy Champion and Medford resident Lori McDougall on her great success on the nationally syndicated game show.

807
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:36,501
She is the sister of sustainability officer and board of appeals clerk

808
01:10:36,978 --> 01:10:39,480
Dennis McDougall on the motion of approval by Councilor Caviello.

809
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:40,601
All those in favor?

810
01:10:40,901 --> 01:10:41,521
All those opposed?

811
01:10:41,561 --> 01:10:42,482
The motion passes.

812
01:10:42,902 --> 01:10:55,231
Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that long-time Method residents, David and June Klein, be recognized for celebrating their 61st wedding anniversary.

813
01:10:55,571 --> 01:10:57,753
Councilor Marks, happy anniversary.

814
01:10:58,253 --> 01:10:59,194
Thank you, Mr. President.

815
01:10:59,234 --> 01:11:04,558
You couldn't meet a nicer couple, David and June Klein, are long-time Method residents.

816
01:11:05,483 --> 01:11:08,885
They raised three great children in this community.

817
01:11:09,806 --> 01:11:16,230
And I asked David, when I saw him the other day, what is the secret to a happy marriage of 61 years?

818
01:11:17,031 --> 01:11:22,134
And the words of wisdom that came from my friend was, it's a work in progress.

819
01:11:23,235 --> 01:11:26,477
And I think, you know, I think he's correct with that.

820
01:11:26,957 --> 01:11:29,759
You know, he said it's ongoing.

821
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:31,160
Every day you have to work at it.

822
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:34,842
And if there are any indication of

823
01:11:35,813 --> 01:11:36,774
what life's all about.

824
01:11:36,794 --> 01:11:39,415
I'm proud to know both of them.

825
01:11:39,435 --> 01:11:44,998
So I want to wish them a happy 61st wedding anniversary and many, many more to come.

826
01:11:45,918 --> 01:11:47,559
The motion approved by Councilor Marks.

827
01:11:47,619 --> 01:11:48,300
All those in favor?

828
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:49,400
All those opposed?

829
01:11:49,841 --> 01:11:51,942
Happy anniversary at Molto Sanos.

830
01:11:52,842 --> 01:12:04,008
Offered by Councilor Marks, be it resolved that the street sweeping on main roads be discussed, whereas residents who reside on the main roads have no way to park their car due to resident permit parking on many side streets, Councilor Marks.

831
01:12:04,473 --> 01:12:17,958
I'll be brief, Mr. President, but back some 10 years ago, the city of Method implemented a pilot program where sweeping on main roads would be more frequently done than in the neighborhoods.

832
01:12:19,478 --> 01:12:32,743
I'm sad to report that the pilot program is still in effect 10 years later and that residents in this community that live on a main road and have to move their car

833
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:47,355
And unfortunately, like in Salt Method on Main Street and a number of areas, Boston Ave have nowhere to put their car because all the surrounding streets are resident permit parking, and they're not eligible for a resident permit parking sticker.

834
01:12:47,755 --> 01:12:56,078
Just recently, if you went down Boston Ave at 430 in the morning, it was lined with orange tickets of residents' cars, Mr. President.

835
01:12:56,959 --> 01:12:59,760
And residents have nowhere to move their car.

836
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:02,781
And I would ask that either a subcommittee

837
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:05,043
or the Traffic Commission.

838
01:13:05,643 --> 01:13:25,476
The Chief has been telling us they're working on city-wide parking permits, but it's been about two years now that I've been hearing that, and I think something needs to be done to alleviate the concerns of those residents on main streets in this community, and I just want to move that forward, Mr. President.

839
01:13:25,516 --> 01:13:31,600
So on the motion, Councilman Marks, let this go to the Public Works Subcommittee, which you sit on.

840
01:13:34,788 --> 01:13:35,569
All those in favor?

841
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:37,051
All those opposed?

842
01:13:37,151 --> 01:13:37,852
Motion carries.

843
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:50,668
16-575, under suspension offered by Council and IP, resolved that the administration provide an update on the status of the retaining wall at Morgan and Gaston, that the Council appropriated free cash funds

844
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:53,302
To make structurally sound, Councillor Knight.

845
01:13:53,422 --> 01:13:54,262
Yes, Mr. President.

846
01:13:54,362 --> 01:14:10,550
In early 2015, this council appropriated about $1.4 million in what was called the Community Improvement Initiative, and included in that was some funds to make structurally sound a retaining wall that had collapsed on a private residence between Gaston and Morgan Street, Mr. President.

847
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:17,813
And there was some discussion about whether or not the property would be leaned if this construction work took place, and there was some confirmation that the property would be

848
01:14:18,466 --> 01:14:25,868
I'd ask the administration for an update, as I've gotten a number of inquiries from neighbours and residents about the property, concerned about the structure and about the safety thereof.

849
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:29,188
On the motion approved by Councillor Night, all those in favour?

850
01:14:29,208 --> 01:14:29,748
All those opposed?

851
01:14:29,788 --> 01:14:31,529
Councillor Marks.

852
01:14:31,649 --> 01:14:34,409
If we could get a report of the vote of the Council on that.

853
01:14:35,229 --> 01:14:38,650
I remember the issue, but I don't remember taking a vote on that.

854
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:42,171
But I may be forgetful on that.

855
01:14:42,891 --> 01:14:44,911
But I'd like to see the vote of the Council on that.

856
01:14:48,093 --> 01:14:59,156
I have a problem with putting any type of city money on personal property in the community, and so I'd like to see that vote, Mr. President, also.

857
01:14:59,636 --> 01:15:03,317
On the motion for approval by Councillor Knight, as amended by Councillor Marks, all those in favour?

858
01:15:03,657 --> 01:15:04,237
All those opposed?

859
01:15:04,257 --> 01:15:05,958
The motion carries.

860
01:15:06,098 --> 01:15:10,819
Now back to the removal from the table offered by Councillor Knight, 16-533, the 2017 fiscal year budget.

861
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:16,851
municipal and school.

862
01:15:17,331 --> 01:15:20,474
It was tabled on June 7th at $162,100,545.

863
01:15:21,054 --> 01:15:25,438
We received in that time an amendation to that based upon council input and school committee input.

864
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:27,740
It is now amended and come off the table at $162,108.

865
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:50,199
$162,108,545, a net $8,000 change.

866
01:15:50,620 --> 01:16:07,695
That reflects changes both on the school side and changes on the city side, most in particularly the granting of monies to the council at the council's request to undertake legal action.

867
01:16:08,335 --> 01:16:11,338
So we have before us the amended budget dated June

868
01:16:12,278 --> 01:16:21,120
15, 2016, and councillors all received it on their tables last week at the total of $162,108,545.

869
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:22,260
That breaks down to $107,775,545 city, $54,333,000 school.

870
01:16:41,860 --> 01:16:43,661
that I mentioned earlier.

871
01:16:43,721 --> 01:16:44,622
Chair awaits a motion.

872
01:16:51,747 --> 01:16:52,307
Councilor Knight.

873
01:16:52,487 --> 01:16:58,712
I'd like to ask the Director of Finance to come up and give a brief overview of the budget and what it entails.

874
01:16:58,952 --> 01:17:01,954
The Mayor's budget statement might be sufficient.

875
01:17:04,617 --> 01:17:13,262
We have with us Anne Baker, the Director of Finance for the city, who participated in the preparation of the budget, and she'll give us a brief overview.

876
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:25,170
Well, as you know, we've all gone through every line of the budget, and there's been a lot of proposals, a couple of changes that were made to give the council some legal funds in their budget of approximately $20,000.

877
01:17:25,650 --> 01:17:33,995
And it was $33,000 put into the bottom line of the school budget, and I believe the intended

878
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:39,874
The purpose of that is for additional kindergarten needs, and I believe that was a recommendation of the council.

879
01:17:41,375 --> 01:17:49,561
The proposed budget is a 4.3% increase from last year, and includes a 2.6% increase in the public school spending.

880
01:17:49,581 --> 01:17:55,506
And $2.5 million from increases in fixed costs such as health insurance is $1.35 million.

881
01:17:55,526 --> 01:17:55,946
Pension costs is $444,000.

882
01:18:00,352 --> 01:18:06,375
Trash recycling is an increase of $449,000, and debt is $245,000.

883
01:18:07,256 --> 01:18:13,119
An additional $500,000 is attributed to the MWRA assessments for water and sewer.

884
01:18:13,139 --> 01:18:17,041
If these fixed costs are excluded, the increase is only 2.2%.

885
01:18:18,222 --> 01:18:25,045
So those fixed costs are really pretty much out of control of the city.

886
01:18:25,065 --> 01:18:28,127
I don't know if you want to help out, you want to go do it anymore?

887
01:18:31,692 --> 01:18:39,537
We've added a halftime position for information technology to assist in moving the city to office 365.

888
01:18:39,578 --> 01:19:00,212
Uh, we fill all the vacant positions in the department of public works, including augmenting the tree warden from a part time to a full time position, uh, maintaining current police staffing levels with the addition of funding to begin the process of transferring over to civilian dispatch officers.

889
01:19:01,068 --> 01:19:08,592
This, in fact, will augment the police services with 10 additional officers that served in dispatch that will now be serving as police officers.

890
01:19:08,913 --> 01:19:15,977
Not that they didn't serve as police officers before, but they would be patrol officers.

891
01:19:16,317 --> 01:19:19,359
Increase the current fire staffing levels by one firefighter.

892
01:19:19,499 --> 01:19:29,625
Increase in personnel costs are reflective of settlement of the collective bargaining agreement in 2016 for a contract that expired in 2013 that was recently just settled.

893
01:19:30,711 --> 01:19:36,597
The impact from the three fiscal years of the wage increases that are seen in the fiscal 17 budget is a three-year agreement.

894
01:19:38,178 --> 01:19:42,502
We're appointing a part-time custodian to the Chevalier Commission budget.

895
01:19:42,522 --> 01:19:43,423
That's a new position.

896
01:19:46,285 --> 01:19:56,174
We're committed to funding the requirements of the State Library Commission to ensure that we'll maintain the grant from the state for the library funding.

897
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:03,325
Restructuring of the building department to incorporate the weights and measures inspector into that department.

898
01:20:04,486 --> 01:20:06,748
An increase in the school budget of 1.4 million.

899
01:20:13,834 --> 01:20:17,557
The city's budget is supported by the following revenue sources as every year.

900
01:20:18,257 --> 01:20:20,319
Real and personal property taxes of 104 million.

901
01:20:22,375 --> 01:20:33,358
Local receipts of $16 million, of which you've received the detail of the local receipts in your packets, which includes hotel and meals tax and cable fees.

902
01:20:33,558 --> 01:20:48,082
Enterprise revenues from the water and sewer of $24 million, which supports the enterprise operations and those costs in the budget that support fixed costs for those employees in the enterprise budget.

903
01:20:49,038 --> 01:21:01,522
Building assistance reimbursements of 3.2 million that we received from the Mass State Building Commission for the schools that we built in 2001 and 2000, that's 3.2 million.

904
01:21:03,922 --> 01:21:11,845
And net local aid from the state house budget one, which I don't believe is passed yet, but in there for us is 15.6 million.

905
01:21:15,248 --> 01:21:19,109
And the local aid is expected to be about $300,000 greater than last year.

906
01:21:20,210 --> 01:21:21,690
Do you have any further questions?

907
01:21:22,151 --> 01:21:22,571
Thank you.

908
01:21:22,631 --> 01:21:28,653
And may I point out that the city council has been meeting on this budget since Monday, June 6th.

909
01:21:29,193 --> 01:21:32,154
We've met several times each week and on Saturdays.

910
01:21:32,995 --> 01:21:33,995
Um, and we've, uh,

911
01:21:34,492 --> 01:21:44,380
sent dozens upon dozens upon dozens of papers, questions and requests to various heads in the mayor's office for answers.

912
01:21:45,081 --> 01:21:51,706
And, uh, we've, uh, received answers, uh, and great detail, uh, to the council.

913
01:21:52,187 --> 01:21:57,051
And we've also had ample opportunity to have discussions on this budget.

914
01:21:57,551 --> 01:22:01,755
We've had discussions with department heads on this budget and other matters.

915
01:22:02,295 --> 01:22:10,399
And we've had frequent discussions in repartee with various members of the administration and their designees.

916
01:22:10,999 --> 01:22:12,460
So now the budget's before us.

917
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:13,720
Councilor Knight, you still have the floor.

918
01:22:13,820 --> 01:22:19,203
Mr. President, I think it might be nice if we extend the same opportunity to the superintendent to give us a brief rundown of his budget as well.

919
01:22:19,223 --> 01:22:29,908
I'm sure the opportunity to discuss the budget by the superintendent to the budget that was reviewed by the council and reviewed

920
01:22:30,608 --> 01:22:33,490
designed and approved by the school committee.

921
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:35,251
Mr. Superintendent, welcome tonight.

922
01:22:36,452 --> 01:22:38,314
Thank you, Mr. President, members of the council.

923
01:22:38,334 --> 01:22:45,479
It was before you last week, and I went over the budget in detail with you.

924
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:48,040
You did ask for some additional information.

925
01:22:48,060 --> 01:22:52,123
I believe it was forwarded to you over the weekend, if not sooner.

926
01:22:52,984 --> 01:22:58,448
And I'm not sure what specifically you want to talk about, but if there's something specific, I'd be happy to talk.

927
01:22:59,903 --> 01:23:01,524
I'm more or less Mr. Belson.

928
01:23:01,564 --> 01:23:08,148
I figured it might be good to just give a brief breakdown of the highlights in the budget for those of us that are here for the first time.

929
01:23:09,029 --> 01:23:10,650
I certainly can appreciate the work that you do.

930
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:12,592
It's quite a voluminous document.

931
01:23:13,012 --> 01:23:17,175
So as Director of Finance and Administration pointed out, the proposed budget was $54,333,000.

932
01:23:17,275 --> 01:23:19,156
It's an increase over FY 2016 of $1.4 the overall projected

933
01:23:28,565 --> 01:23:36,667
appropriated budget represents a 2.6 increase from last year, and the budget is buttressed by 2.1 of generated revenue.

934
01:23:36,847 --> 01:23:45,448
When the generated revenue is included, the actual projected budgetary expense will be 56,443,392, or a 3.2% increase over FY 2016.

935
01:23:47,509 --> 01:23:55,090
Also, as we've indicated, various aid allocations and grants from federal, state, non-profit groups, corporate sources, and the like are factored in.

936
01:23:56,249 --> 01:24:06,113
We are concerned that the state budget is under some duress right now, because there are funds that come to the school directly from the state, and it's hard to know what the conference committee is going to do.

937
01:24:07,033 --> 01:24:23,680
There are some funds that could be vulnerable, especially since the governor has indicated that the projected shortfall going forward is greater than was originally anticipated, by about $200,000 more than was previously anticipated.

938
01:24:26,463 --> 01:24:32,887
We provide sufficient resources to enable us to meet the requirements of state and federal mandates that are in place.

939
01:24:33,467 --> 01:24:37,950
Undoubtedly, there are a number of contingencies that happen every year that we have to make adjustments for.

940
01:24:39,250 --> 01:24:45,094
Fiscal 2016 saw the successful negotiations of virtually every contract in the school department.

941
01:24:46,455 --> 01:24:51,277
There is one contract out there, but we believe that will close sometime over the next two weeks.

942
01:24:51,317 --> 01:24:52,218
That's with the Carpenters.

943
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:54,739
There are only three members of that particular group.

944
01:24:56,807 --> 01:25:08,271
But all the funding that we need is accounted for in that budget proposal and budget that was approved by the Medford School Committee on June 20th.

945
01:25:09,511 --> 01:25:13,072
We're working with the mayor, as you know, and you've asked for some of these things on capital planning.

946
01:25:13,792 --> 01:25:14,733
You asked for a listing.

947
01:25:14,793 --> 01:25:15,713
I gave you a listing.

948
01:25:16,253 --> 01:25:21,595
I also gave you a short-term listing of things that we thought might happen sooner or would like to happen sooner.

949
01:25:22,415 --> 01:25:25,476
Obviously, it has to be factored into the total cities approach.

950
01:25:26,212 --> 01:25:28,613
to capital planning, and we look forward to working with the mayor.

951
01:25:30,794 --> 01:25:32,095
We've talked about a number of things.

952
01:25:32,175 --> 01:25:34,616
Overall enrollments in the schools remain pretty stable.

953
01:25:35,937 --> 01:25:37,418
Class sizes are very, very good.

954
01:25:38,998 --> 01:25:45,722
The actual distributions by school will vary somewhat as people come and go during the summer months.

955
01:25:46,202 --> 01:25:52,645
The vocational enrollment is definitively up, and there are a number of new offerings that we think are

956
01:25:53,423 --> 01:25:56,085
terrific offerings, and our young people are flocking to them.

957
01:25:57,126 --> 01:26:02,250
Minute Man allocation has been sharply reduced over the last several years.

958
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:03,751
Three years ago it was a million dollars.

959
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:08,695
It's now down to about 400, and it will be less than that going forward.

960
01:26:09,376 --> 01:26:14,560
We do anticipate some increase in ELL students, students who don't speak English as a first language.

961
01:26:20,862 --> 01:26:21,962
We have some retirements.

962
01:26:22,062 --> 01:26:24,243
I've indicated that some of that will come and go.

963
01:26:24,263 --> 01:26:27,505
And when we gave you the budget, it was 16 known retirements.

964
01:26:27,525 --> 01:26:36,068
There may be a couple more that come in over the summer because people are talking to us, but I can't tell you who they are at this point because they haven't made up their mind.

965
01:26:37,069 --> 01:26:41,911
There were approximately 11 faculty members when we gave you this budget originally who were not going to be rehired.

966
01:26:42,491 --> 01:26:48,173
I think we made some decisions to rehire at least two of those that were previously on the list to not be rehired.

967
01:26:48,693 --> 01:26:50,374
There may be a couple more that we bring back.

968
01:26:51,407 --> 01:26:54,110
Sometimes we put people on a list like that as to give us more time.

969
01:26:54,650 --> 01:27:03,297
The state law requires that when we have a non-professional status teacher, we have to notify them by June 15th if we believe that we may not rehire them.

970
01:27:03,958 --> 01:27:06,780
That's not true for other kinds of positions, but it is true for teachers.

971
01:27:07,441 --> 01:27:13,786
So we sometimes put some extra people on that list just to be sure that we've covered the bases.

972
01:27:19,475 --> 01:27:21,216
Elementary supplies have increased.

973
01:27:21,616 --> 01:27:23,536
All supplies across the district have increased.

974
01:27:23,556 --> 01:27:28,998
I think I did tell you that Envision was in its last year of payment.

975
01:27:29,018 --> 01:27:29,519
It's about $82,000.

976
01:27:29,999 --> 01:27:34,240
And after that, we'll be able to take that amount and use it in other areas.

977
01:27:36,661 --> 01:27:47,685
We did tell you a little bit about our desire not to ask parents to provide substantial amounts of supplies and materials that the school department believes we provide quite a bit.

978
01:27:48,287 --> 01:28:02,277
and that we should be able to cover their needs without asking parents to do much more than a handful of things that they would use at home for the youngster coming home, paper, pencils, pens, rulers, things of that type that might be necessary.

979
01:28:02,717 --> 01:28:07,280
The science budget included 10,000 funding for additional elementary science kits.

980
01:28:08,221 --> 01:28:10,783
The Journey's English language program has already been paid for.

981
01:28:10,803 --> 01:28:12,664
The ELL budget has 6,000 more in it.

982
01:28:14,461 --> 01:28:18,263
There's also additional $2,000 for translation services.

983
01:28:18,703 --> 01:28:23,666
And we've added 1.5 positions to that area to accommodate the incoming people.

984
01:28:24,307 --> 01:28:27,309
The special ed department will add an adjustment counselor to that level.

985
01:28:27,889 --> 01:28:33,572
There will be 16 adjustment psychologists and four behavioral specialists going forward.

986
01:28:33,632 --> 01:28:39,676
But we've added a fifth behaviorist as part of the discussions with the school committee in their last hearing.

987
01:28:40,316 --> 01:28:43,258
And it's also included in what I've sent to you.

988
01:28:45,761 --> 01:28:50,662
We've eliminated one administrative position, the clinical coordinator's position.

989
01:28:51,162 --> 01:28:57,664
We've added a librarian to the middle school, so each school will have access to a full-time librarian.

990
01:28:57,684 --> 01:29:03,545
Not full-time, but they'll share a librarian plus some para help.

991
01:29:04,405 --> 01:29:06,526
We've added a math coach to the elementary schools.

992
01:29:07,746 --> 01:29:11,587
We've added three full-time kindergarten aides to the Roberts Elementary.

993
01:29:13,599 --> 01:29:16,620
And I believe that's the limit on that.

994
01:29:17,940 --> 01:29:26,901
The vocational school will be adding four teachers to support expanded programs, engineering, robotics, business technology, multimedia program, computer, and business.

995
01:29:27,721 --> 01:29:29,342
Hospitality program is envisioned.

996
01:29:29,422 --> 01:29:33,282
It may happen with some additional dollars that come from the outside.

997
01:29:34,163 --> 01:29:39,263
The vocational budget is $10,000 more for instructional supplies, an additional $23,000 to support needed equipment.

998
01:29:39,783 --> 01:29:41,244
And they also get $65,000 of Perkins federal funds

999
01:29:44,358 --> 01:29:45,218
that we think will be good.

1000
01:29:45,238 --> 01:29:50,742
They'll also, as I indicate, save some money in the tuition to Minuteman.

1001
01:29:51,122 --> 01:29:56,325
The English department has added $2,000 for textbooks and also e-readers.

1002
01:29:56,345 --> 01:30:03,069
It will also help to support a program that helps youngsters in transition.

1003
01:30:03,129 --> 01:30:09,133
The mathematics department will be adopting a new high school textbook program with an annual payment of $36,000 each for three years.

1004
01:30:11,245 --> 01:30:17,309
Additional math upgrades will follow over the next two years as the Envision payment is done this year.

1005
01:30:18,009 --> 01:30:22,432
The department will also be doing some work with school computer science programs and share some teaching time.

1006
01:30:23,292 --> 01:30:27,015
The science department has $10,000 increase to fund the elementary engineering program.

1007
01:30:27,095 --> 01:30:28,295
I indicated that before.

1008
01:30:29,556 --> 01:30:32,438
The social studies department maintains a strong textbook account of $20,000.

1009
01:30:32,838 --> 01:30:38,542
That will help them with their advanced placement European textbooks and with

1010
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:44,033
other books that are part of their overall program, including a global scholars program.

1011
01:30:44,473 --> 01:30:49,557
They did add 14 classroom sets of new eighth grade US history textbooks this past year.

1012
01:30:50,197 --> 01:31:00,944
The foreign language department has an increase of $11,200 to support the acquisition of new Spanish textbooks and to support the Latin program that has been reinstituted.

1013
01:31:01,465 --> 01:31:07,549
The physical education department, health education, will receive 9,000 more in place of classroom supplies and equipment system wide.

1014
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:12,139
That came from a decrease in the need to fund the Michigan model, which has already been purchased.

1015
01:31:12,619 --> 01:31:17,501
That's the health education model that we use in conjunction with our substance abuse prevention program.

1016
01:31:17,961 --> 01:31:23,643
The Fine Arts Department will stay consistent when 9,600 was added to support programs.

1017
01:31:25,023 --> 01:31:27,464
We did talk about the band program.

1018
01:31:27,484 --> 01:31:37,347
We're working on a paper that we will bring to you to sell off some old musical instruments and deposit that in a gift account that will require your approval.

1019
01:31:37,794 --> 01:31:41,716
so that we can then reinvest that in the music department going forward.

1020
01:31:42,337 --> 01:31:44,898
The library and media instructional technology has been increased by $14,900.

1021
01:31:45,798 --> 01:31:56,164
It's on top of last year's $70,000 increase, which we put in the budget for instructional supplies to ensure that our technology is properly able to go forward.

1022
01:31:57,025 --> 01:31:59,146
There are several grants that fund these things as well.

1023
01:32:02,027 --> 01:32:04,869
We have some money in Block 03 for technology infrastructure.

1024
01:32:05,378 --> 01:32:12,844
The Health Services Department provides a nursing service to our schools and contributes greatly to our efforts to support social emotional issues and substance abuse prevention.

1025
01:32:13,425 --> 01:32:17,568
The staff also assists with SPED medical issues that are part of IEPs and 504 plans.

1026
01:32:18,369 --> 01:32:22,773
The small increase in the budget to cover contractual professional development and summer coverage.

1027
01:32:24,134 --> 01:32:31,120
I told you that the Department of Public Health gave us a $15,000 grant to coordinate with outside agencies.

1028
01:32:31,620 --> 01:32:32,521
It's an innovative grant.

1029
01:32:33,080 --> 01:32:34,841
Not many in the Commonwealth at this point in time.

1030
01:32:34,881 --> 01:32:36,782
Hopefully, we can do something really good with it.

1031
01:32:36,802 --> 01:32:42,305
The Department of Public Health also pays for at least the majority of at least one other nursing physician.

1032
01:32:43,086 --> 01:32:51,571
The guidance department added an additional counselor to staff last year, but they're getting $800 more to help them with their supplies, materials, and professional development.

1033
01:32:52,611 --> 01:33:02,657
We will continue to pay for the PSAT program, which enables youngsters to take that version of the SAT at the early stages, because many kids can't afford that.

1034
01:33:03,226 --> 01:33:07,168
The middle school budget will see an increase in student activities lines by 2,000 per school.

1035
01:33:08,048 --> 01:33:14,091
We will be filling the assistant principal position at the Andrews, which was vacated by the retirement of Miriam Morata.

1036
01:33:15,091 --> 01:33:28,337
We will be filling the assistant principal position at the Brooks, which was initiated by the leaving of Kevin Andrews as a principal and the promotion of Suzanne Galussi to the position of principal.

1037
01:33:29,321 --> 01:33:32,622
We've increased funding to sustain a third late bus at the middle schools.

1038
01:33:32,782 --> 01:33:37,242
Parents and others like that, they feel that kids need more time to stay after school.

1039
01:33:37,863 --> 01:33:43,584
Medford High School will see a $12,500 increase in non-salary lines to accurately reflect actual expenditures.

1040
01:33:44,124 --> 01:33:46,324
The high school student activities block will increase by 10,000.

1041
01:33:46,404 --> 01:33:49,405
There's a lot of activities going in by the high school.

1042
01:33:50,065 --> 01:33:50,965
You see it all the time.

1043
01:33:51,005 --> 01:33:52,605
The kids are always coming up with new things.

1044
01:33:52,645 --> 01:33:53,705
They're really doing a great job.

1045
01:33:54,505 --> 01:33:57,606
The athletic department salary account reflects the actual cost of coaches.

1046
01:33:58,258 --> 01:33:59,438
and the trainer's full salary.

1047
01:33:59,899 --> 01:34:07,321
Each year we weigh information, the cost of contracted services, officials, bosses, things of that that sometimes drive the cost up.

1048
01:34:07,441 --> 01:34:13,883
We're also moving, as we've told you, into the Northeast Conference, effective this spring, so that the GBL will merge in.

1049
01:34:14,443 --> 01:34:16,924
The details will flow out in the next little while.

1050
01:34:18,645 --> 01:34:23,086
We talked about a user's fee, but we kind of decided at the last minute we weren't going to do that.

1051
01:34:23,926 --> 01:34:26,067
We would eat that and try to find other ways to raise money.

1052
01:34:27,170 --> 01:34:30,092
Security budget reflects the increase in personnel covering our buildings.

1053
01:34:30,653 --> 01:34:34,255
The Raptor technology system is picked up in our technology budget.

1054
01:34:34,275 --> 01:34:36,676
We've paid for most of it now, which is supplies and materials.

1055
01:34:37,317 --> 01:34:44,121
At this point, we also have some money for camera repairs, but the bulk of camera upgrades will be in capital.

1056
01:34:44,901 --> 01:34:48,624
Our operation and maintenance budget reflects a salary increase for custodial and maintenance staffs.

1057
01:34:49,164 --> 01:34:52,746
We go out to bid for the cleaning service, projecting a 10% increase.

1058
01:34:53,327 --> 01:34:55,108
Our heating and utilities are expected to remain

1059
01:34:55,810 --> 01:34:56,731
pretty much the same.

1060
01:34:58,092 --> 01:35:00,714
We're adding about $50,000 to the supply budget.

1061
01:35:00,754 --> 01:35:06,880
You asked for a breakout, we provided that to you in the weekend distribution to you.

1062
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:10,923
And I indicated major capital repairs would be coming through a different source.

1063
01:35:12,285 --> 01:35:16,548
Regular large vehicle pupil transportation is $120,000 higher than last year.

1064
01:35:16,608 --> 01:35:18,009
We're in the second year of a contract.

1065
01:35:21,442 --> 01:35:22,923
We think we can reduce some of that.

1066
01:35:22,963 --> 01:35:37,813
We hope to be able to reduce some of that by using a smaller bus to take youngsters to Minuteman 1 and also to possibly use our new Transfinder route development system possibly to even consolidate and maybe even drop off a bus.

1067
01:35:38,213 --> 01:35:44,377
We want to be careful before I say that because obviously I don't want the time to increase for youngsters and travel.

1068
01:35:45,297 --> 01:35:49,419
Vocational transportation fund of Block 17 may see some reimbursement from the state.

1069
01:35:49,819 --> 01:35:50,840
I'm wary about that.

1070
01:35:51,821 --> 01:35:55,482
It's 1.7 million statewide for non-resident transportation.

1071
01:35:56,483 --> 01:36:00,705
That's probably a very ripe area to be cut in the state budget and conference committee.

1072
01:36:01,386 --> 01:36:02,086
We hope it doesn't.

1073
01:36:02,626 --> 01:36:07,249
Special education transportation is up 50,000 from last year, reflecting the cost of small vehicles.

1074
01:36:07,689 --> 01:36:09,270
And homeless transportation is also up 50,000.

1075
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:13,212
This was identified as an unfunded mandate originally,

1076
01:36:13,815 --> 01:36:17,157
But the state has not funded it at the level that it truly needs.

1077
01:36:17,557 --> 01:36:20,839
And there are more and more homeless families that we serve every year.

1078
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:24,422
I've talked to you about the public information officer.

1079
01:36:24,462 --> 01:36:26,463
I believe it's a valuable add to us.

1080
01:36:26,483 --> 01:36:29,745
I think that the position is well worth what we put into it.

1081
01:36:30,185 --> 01:36:33,888
And I believe that we've already seen some significant payback.

1082
01:36:34,528 --> 01:36:39,751
So we believe we've provided for many of the priorities identified by our professionals in the school committee.

1083
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:45,001
We all realize no budget provides for everything, and no budget does everything that everyone wants.

1084
01:36:45,021 --> 01:36:46,502
A lot of things are aspirational.

1085
01:36:47,383 --> 01:36:57,889
And I want to thank my staff and the people that work with me for putting this together, because I believe they've done yeoman's work in making sure that the school budget is a good document.

1086
01:36:58,049 --> 01:37:00,091
And the school committee, I believe, put a lot of time in.

1087
01:37:00,111 --> 01:37:04,373
They've had several pre-budget hearings, as you know what we're talking about.

1088
01:37:04,413 --> 01:37:07,775
They met right through the year, talking with department heads, getting their feedback.

1089
01:37:08,376 --> 01:37:10,397
And then they met in June.

1090
01:37:11,235 --> 01:37:15,558
twice to go over their priorities and to make final decisions.

1091
01:37:16,219 --> 01:37:20,662
So, Mr. President, I think that gives you a little bit to start with, and I'll be happy to take any questions.

1092
01:37:21,003 --> 01:37:23,144
The President Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

1093
01:37:24,225 --> 01:37:39,577
I'm told that you signed up for some more time with the school department, and we're very grateful to your good work, your leadership in the community, and for having been not just an administrator, but a classroom teacher, showing

1094
01:37:40,097 --> 01:37:43,838
people the way, and we're very grateful to you for all your kind work.

1095
01:37:44,198 --> 01:37:44,638
I appreciate it.

1096
01:37:45,498 --> 01:37:45,858
Thank you.

1097
01:37:47,539 --> 01:37:50,040
Councilor Knight, I believe you still have the floor.

1098
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:51,940
I'd like to echo your sentiments, Mr. President.

1099
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:55,661
I think Mr. Belson and his team did a wonderful job putting this budget together.

1100
01:37:55,941 --> 01:37:57,341
It's a strong school department budget.

1101
01:37:58,002 --> 01:38:07,784
I feel as though they've done a great job meeting all state and federal mandates, maintaining small class sizes of 20 students or less, expanding vocational opportunities in engineering and robotics.

1102
01:38:08,363 --> 01:38:17,110
business, technology, biotech, the environment, emergency response, ems, Mr. President, cooperative education opportunities have expanded.

1103
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:18,971
We're going to see a multimedia program up there.

1104
01:38:20,352 --> 01:38:37,665
We've seen the opportunity to integrate medford high school students and medford vocational high school, vocational technical high school students in the same programming, which is something that wasn't in place before with that brick wall that was between the two schools that no one could climb over has been broken down, Mr. President, and we're seeing students that are exploring

1105
01:38:38,710 --> 01:38:40,511
opportunities that they didn't have in the past.

1106
01:38:41,591 --> 01:38:42,212
We look at the budget.

1107
01:38:42,232 --> 01:38:52,036
It also funds a new reading and literacy program, a new mathematics program at the elementary level, expands after school programs, and it actually allows for the creation of new before school programs.

1108
01:38:52,716 --> 01:39:00,100
We have three full-time elementary aides that are going to be coming in at the Roberts, and we still maintain a whole student focus, which is something that I think is very important.

1109
01:39:00,140 --> 01:39:07,403
Mr. President, this, you know, budget in the school side makes a commitment to technology, and we've also seen school security improvements, increases in

1110
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:12,002
personnel and equipment there, which is something that this council's certainly expressed concern over.

1111
01:39:12,022 --> 01:39:16,725
So I'd like to thank Superintendent Belson for his work and that of the school committee as well on this document.

1112
01:39:16,805 --> 01:39:21,228
I think it's a well-prepared document and I feel as though it's something I'm comfortable supporting today.

1113
01:39:23,909 --> 01:39:24,229
Thank you.

1114
01:39:24,470 --> 01:39:26,231
Chair recognizes Vice President Lago-Curran.

1115
01:39:26,911 --> 01:39:28,172
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

1116
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:33,375
Auditor Ann Baker, you mentioned the kindergarten aides.

1117
01:39:34,595 --> 01:39:37,077
Since the last time we met a week ago,

1118
01:39:37,955 --> 01:39:41,618
You said that, has there been an addition to that?

1119
01:39:42,178 --> 01:39:46,802
The original, this amended budget was increased on the school side by $33,000.

1120
01:39:47,762 --> 01:39:55,588
And I was told that the intention of that money that was supposed to go to a kidney guy needs Mr. Belson to be able to answer that.

1121
01:39:55,608 --> 01:39:57,990
But that's what I was- So that's 11 still?

1122
01:39:58,190 --> 01:39:59,311
I know nothing about it.

1123
01:40:00,032 --> 01:40:00,872
I know nothing about it.

1124
01:40:02,430 --> 01:40:08,732
If it's been done through the city's administration, I'll take the money obviously.

1125
01:40:09,152 --> 01:40:11,572
But the school committee does not know about it as far as I know.

1126
01:40:12,152 --> 01:40:13,633
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1127
01:40:13,953 --> 01:40:18,374
Mr. President, I'm not sure how something can happen in the school budget if the school committee didn't vote on it.

1128
01:40:19,294 --> 01:40:20,574
So maybe Ms.

1129
01:40:20,594 --> 01:40:22,675
Baker can give us a little more information where this came from.

1130
01:40:23,294 --> 01:40:26,995
I just, it was the amended budget was submitted with an additional 33,000.

1131
01:40:27,035 --> 01:40:29,776
That's what I was not part of the discussion.

1132
01:40:29,836 --> 01:40:37,578
I was told that it was for the, for the bottom line, uh, in the school budget and that there was some talk that it would go to kindergarten.

1133
01:40:37,778 --> 01:40:38,098
Okay.

1134
01:40:38,118 --> 01:40:48,721
So I think through the chair, I think there was an addition from the first, we got the first one, we got June 2nd to June 13th and then no, there has been no additional money since we met last week.

1135
01:40:49,101 --> 01:40:50,821
When we were in committee of the whole last week,

1136
01:40:52,847 --> 01:41:01,671
But Ann publicized that there was additional money for kindergarten aid, so it was a little confusing whether that was from the beginning of June or within this last week.

1137
01:41:01,691 --> 01:41:04,453
The superintendent just told us it wasn't part of the budget that they approved.

1138
01:41:04,933 --> 01:41:05,373
It was not.

1139
01:41:05,453 --> 01:41:05,774
Correct.

1140
01:41:05,894 --> 01:41:06,094
Right.

1141
01:41:06,834 --> 01:41:07,494
So maybe Ms.

1142
01:41:07,554 --> 01:41:14,578
Baker was slightly mistaken because she wasn't present at the meeting, but she is aware of the bottom line and the dollar amount.

1143
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:15,378
Right.

1144
01:41:17,299 --> 01:41:19,380
Well, the dollar amount includes an additional 33,000 according to

1145
01:41:21,553 --> 01:41:23,795
this administration's representative that's up here tonight.

1146
01:41:24,696 --> 01:41:26,337
So how does that take place, Mr. President?

1147
01:41:26,477 --> 01:41:31,501
Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

1148
01:41:32,842 --> 01:41:45,352
I'm looking at this as the $33,000 that was appropriated from the bottom line, then the increase to the Roberts that you said was increased, I believe, to add their kindergarten needs.

1149
01:41:45,532 --> 01:41:46,253
That's what I believe.

1150
01:41:46,413 --> 01:41:47,093
I was told it was $33,000

1151
01:41:49,961 --> 01:41:51,722
increase the school bottom line.

1152
01:41:51,762 --> 01:41:52,022
Correct.

1153
01:41:52,082 --> 01:41:52,322
Okay.

1154
01:41:52,342 --> 01:42:01,867
So, and I know the superintendent mentioned that there was an increase to the Roberts kindergarten aid positions to make that a full, um, number.

1155
01:42:02,027 --> 01:42:02,967
I believe that's what it was.

1156
01:42:02,987 --> 01:42:06,329
Can I ask just a point of clarification?

1157
01:42:06,409 --> 01:42:08,009
Listen, I wasn't part of the budget discussion.

1158
01:42:08,069 --> 01:42:08,790
As far as I know, it's $54,333,000.

1159
01:42:08,830 --> 01:42:09,590
That's the budget.

1160
01:42:09,610 --> 01:42:11,771
That's the budget the school committee approved.

1161
01:42:20,123 --> 01:42:21,444
And that is the budget that's there.

1162
01:42:21,464 --> 01:42:24,205
So maybe the original budget that was presented to you was mistaken.

1163
01:42:24,225 --> 01:42:27,107
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1164
01:42:27,387 --> 01:42:32,029
I do believe we got our budget books before the school committee finished their deliberations.

1165
01:42:32,109 --> 01:42:35,291
And we also had met prior to the completion of their deliberations.

1166
01:42:37,092 --> 01:42:37,652
Is that not correct?

1167
01:42:38,207 --> 01:42:47,929
uh, we met afterwards, our final meetings last Tuesday, but we initially met, requested an addendum to the budget, what the specifics were of it.

1168
01:42:48,069 --> 01:42:55,590
I don't remember, but I know there was a bottom line increase and that's reflected in the amended budget that was presented to the council last week.

1169
01:42:56,670 --> 01:42:58,831
Thank you.

1170
01:42:59,111 --> 01:43:00,251
Still doesn't answer the question.

1171
01:43:00,851 --> 01:43:02,812
So councilor Marks, if you have a question, what is it?

1172
01:43:03,672 --> 01:43:04,932
I've already asked three times.

1173
01:43:05,788 --> 01:43:06,808
I'll ask a fourth.

1174
01:43:06,868 --> 01:43:11,850
The budget line that the school committee approved has not changed since the school committee approved it on the 20th.

1175
01:43:11,870 --> 01:43:12,090
It's $54,333,000.

1176
01:43:12,211 --> 01:43:15,712
So if something has been added to it, I have not seen anything added to that.

1177
01:43:19,024 --> 01:43:22,666
And Ann is telling me that at this point in time, that's the number in front of you.

1178
01:43:22,846 --> 01:43:23,866
That's the number in front of you.

1179
01:43:23,906 --> 01:43:25,167
That's what the school committee approved.

1180
01:43:25,567 --> 01:43:26,887
That's what I know we have.

1181
01:43:26,907 --> 01:43:33,150
And I know of no addition outside of the three kindergarten aides to the Roberts.

1182
01:43:33,610 --> 01:43:40,833
And I indicated in the letter that I sent to you in response to your query that that increase within the lines

1183
01:43:41,879 --> 01:43:45,341
It would be taken from certain lines, it would be $23,775.

1184
01:43:46,482 --> 01:43:52,426
That's the cost of that particular item, but it's not adding or changing the bottom line.

1185
01:43:52,947 --> 01:43:53,267
Correct.

1186
01:43:53,967 --> 01:43:59,631
So the amended budget that you're dealing with is the approved budget by the school committee, 54,333.

1187
01:43:59,691 --> 01:44:04,774
Apparently, the first budget that was given to you must have been incorrect, because it only said 54,300,000 for the school instead of 54,333,000.

1188
01:44:04,815 --> 01:44:06,676
That's why the amended budget was presented.

1189
01:44:11,988 --> 01:44:13,268
So the first budget was incorrect?

1190
01:44:13,709 --> 01:44:14,129
Apparently.

1191
01:44:16,130 --> 01:44:18,310
Is there anyone from the administration that can answer that question?

1192
01:44:18,771 --> 01:44:22,292
You have it there in front of you.

1193
01:44:22,372 --> 01:44:27,174
Is there a budget person from the mayor's office here to present the $162 million budget?

1194
01:44:27,494 --> 01:44:27,794
Right here.

1195
01:44:28,274 --> 01:44:31,055
No, is there a budget person, not a paper, a person?

1196
01:44:32,076 --> 01:44:34,316
I have to present the budget right here.

1197
01:44:34,336 --> 01:44:34,476
It's $162,108,500.

1198
01:44:34,516 --> 01:44:35,837
It was submitted to you by the mayor.

1199
01:44:39,157 --> 01:44:43,638
So Anne, you drew the short stick and you're representing the administration on the budget tonight.

1200
01:44:43,859 --> 01:44:44,019
Right.

1201
01:44:44,459 --> 01:44:44,699
Okay.

1202
01:44:44,759 --> 01:44:45,459
That's all I want to know.

1203
01:44:45,479 --> 01:44:47,660
You're here representing the administration.

1204
01:44:51,961 --> 01:44:52,361
Anything else?

1205
01:44:53,822 --> 01:44:54,182
Thank you.

1206
01:44:54,322 --> 01:44:55,322
Uh, Madam Vice President.

1207
01:44:56,182 --> 01:44:56,503
Yeah.

1208
01:44:56,903 --> 01:45:00,864
I mean, if, unless we have more, anybody have more questions, I guess you have the floor.

1209
01:45:03,045 --> 01:45:04,945
Um, with regards to the budget.

1210
01:45:05,385 --> 01:45:05,565
Yeah.

1211
01:45:05,605 --> 01:45:06,606
I'm just going to make my statement.

1212
01:45:06,986 --> 01:45:07,326
I don't have any.

1213
01:45:09,225 --> 01:45:14,167
With regards to the budget, I just want to go over some of the positives.

1214
01:45:14,227 --> 01:45:26,691
Like you said, we met for probably 18, 20 hours, and we discussed every line item of the entire budget.

1215
01:45:30,472 --> 01:45:34,314
Some of the positives that came from it are the senior work program.

1216
01:45:34,354 --> 01:45:35,674
I think that is very positive.

1217
01:45:35,734 --> 01:45:37,515
That was initiated in 2000, I believe.

1218
01:45:39,268 --> 01:45:52,398
And we did get, the program was eliminated in 2008, so this year I'm very happy to see that 25 to 30 seniors will be hired to assist them with their, an abatement in their property taxes.

1219
01:45:53,258 --> 01:45:55,420
That's definitely a benefit.

1220
01:45:57,021 --> 01:46:01,504
Firefighters, we're adding 11, sending out 11 conditional offers.

1221
01:46:02,525 --> 01:46:05,627
Hopefully get 11 new firefighters on July and August.

1222
01:46:06,308 --> 01:46:07,989
I think it's great that we're hiring

1223
01:46:08,750 --> 01:46:15,131
Our part-time tree warden to full-time, something that I think this council's asked for and that is in the budget.

1224
01:46:15,591 --> 01:46:15,751
Ms.

1225
01:46:15,791 --> 01:46:17,852
Tudin does an amazing job.

1226
01:46:18,512 --> 01:46:28,054
She is very responsive and extremely on top of it, and I believe she already put in the 40 hours when she was part-time, so it's good to see her full-time.

1227
01:46:29,234 --> 01:46:32,915
Library is fully funded to keep the state certification.

1228
01:46:32,935 --> 01:46:34,595
That was a huge issue last year.

1229
01:46:36,506 --> 01:46:41,289
The prior mayor came through with that, but this year it has been done.

1230
01:46:41,309 --> 01:46:44,691
I think video streaming is something huge.

1231
01:46:46,332 --> 01:46:47,853
People want transparency.

1232
01:46:47,873 --> 01:47:01,281
They want to be able to view meetings, view not only council and school committee meetings, but they want to be able to view subcommittee meetings on a regular basis from their home, whether it be on TV or on the computer or out of the city.

1233
01:47:01,361 --> 01:47:03,002
So that's definitely a positive.

1234
01:47:09,157 --> 01:47:18,005
With regards to the Office of Community Development, I think adding the two positions is extremely important, especially, you know, what we've been going through the last few weeks.

1235
01:47:20,187 --> 01:47:28,695
Going to civilian dispatches, I believe in January, from what the budget states, $200,000 is in that line item to hire civilian dispatchers.

1236
01:47:28,735 --> 01:47:34,560
So that will relieve nine of our officers and put them back on the streets, and I think that's very important.

1237
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:39,823
Another positive is the Code Enforcement Office.

1238
01:47:40,484 --> 01:47:47,089
There is a second position for code enforcement, and I think that's one of the main complaints we get, code enforcement violations.

1239
01:47:47,589 --> 01:47:53,934
And I know John Bovuso has been pulled from that job a little bit, so it's great to have a second.

1240
01:47:55,856 --> 01:48:04,863
It is tough to put together a budget of this size, and I don't envy the person that has to do it or the people that have to do it, but I just wanted to bring out some positives.

1241
01:48:06,117 --> 01:48:20,405
A few things that, you know, I wish we could have saw is, number one, the, sorry, go back.

1242
01:48:20,545 --> 01:48:21,946
It was a tough process, I think.

1243
01:48:22,086 --> 01:48:32,552
Somebody actually, someone commented that it was kind of, I won't even go there, but it was a tough process meeting for 18 hours and having really nobody to answer our questions.

1244
01:48:32,592 --> 01:48:33,753
We didn't have anybody from,

1245
01:48:34,501 --> 01:48:53,924
I was thankful that the mayor spoke to us for the three to five minutes at the beginning of the first meeting, but to have nobody that could answer a question from the administration, to not have a budget director was very tough to handle, and I think we all, I'm sure, had some frustration with that, so I wanted to make that clear.

1246
01:48:53,944 --> 01:49:01,566
Hopefully, the budget director that was hired can get right on top of it so that we can, as Council Falco has asked for,

1247
01:49:03,386 --> 01:49:04,886
you know, updates on the budget.

1248
01:49:06,207 --> 01:49:08,607
Happy with the amount of responses that we did get.

1249
01:49:08,747 --> 01:49:15,428
I mean, piles of information, and it's information we will be able to take back to the tax and rate payers, which is great.

1250
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:20,289
Half of the other responses were a tough swallow.

1251
01:49:21,149 --> 01:49:31,251
A good amount of the responses said that if we made a recommendation, if we asked for something, it was, I'm sorry, we're taxing already to the two and a half limit.

1252
01:49:31,943 --> 01:49:33,684
or we're waiting for the capital plan.

1253
01:49:35,044 --> 01:49:42,086
That's very frustrating, especially since we've asked for the capital plan for the last few months, and we're being told we're going to get it in the fall, we're going to get it in the fall.

1254
01:49:42,526 --> 01:49:45,087
As of last night, we did ask, and there is a rough draft.

1255
01:49:45,127 --> 01:49:50,268
We asked for it, and again, we're not being provided a capital plan.

1256
01:49:50,288 --> 01:49:52,949
And I think the budget goes hand in hand with a capital plan.

1257
01:49:53,329 --> 01:49:55,990
So it would have been nice to see a draft.

1258
01:49:56,110 --> 01:49:57,630
I understand a draft is a draft.

1259
01:49:57,670 --> 01:50:00,471
We might not have the actual figures, but we would know what 10, 20 projects

1260
01:50:01,905 --> 01:50:04,987
we'd be putting money into as part of our capital plan.

1261
01:50:05,027 --> 01:50:10,991
Are we looking down the road at going out to bond for $5 million in the next couple of years or $25 million?

1262
01:50:11,031 --> 01:50:12,572
Are we going to do a new police station?

1263
01:50:12,612 --> 01:50:13,133
Are we not?

1264
01:50:13,513 --> 01:50:18,497
What money are we going to put towards our schools, maintenance, towards the city side?

1265
01:50:18,917 --> 01:50:22,319
It would really have been helpful to be able to see that capital plan.

1266
01:50:25,161 --> 01:50:30,445
I question a budget director being able to handle the procurement position too, but I think

1267
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,585
we definitely need to give that a chance.

1268
01:50:32,665 --> 01:50:36,887
So hopefully that works out.

1269
01:50:37,647 --> 01:50:45,689
When we met with the engineer, I'm very concerned with the fact that there's a lack of construction projects this construction season.

1270
01:50:46,330 --> 01:50:59,874
We spoke and asked questions about Everett Street, Parris Street, Pinkert, Gorley, Dwyer, now Winthrop Street we're getting complaints about, and to have no capital construction plans.

1271
01:51:00,755 --> 01:51:08,858
in such a important time, we only have until October to do our streets and roads over and to not really have any projects is disturbing.

1272
01:51:09,778 --> 01:51:18,581
Whether it be lack of funding or lack of personnel in that office, I think that's something that definitely needs some more attention.

1273
01:51:20,342 --> 01:51:26,724
The fire department at, say, Riverside Ave is the second busiest station in Medford.

1274
01:51:28,865 --> 01:51:34,327
yet we have the mayor who supported a 490-unit complex in that area.

1275
01:51:37,168 --> 01:51:38,768
That's something I have concern about.

1276
01:51:38,828 --> 01:51:44,830
We do have the 11 offices, which is great, but I think we need to be able to step up enforcement.

1277
01:51:45,451 --> 01:51:51,112
The zoning board, I believe, is meeting right now over a 200- or 300-unit complex behind Wendy's.

1278
01:51:54,133 --> 01:51:55,374
Sorry, I'm boring you, Ed?

1279
01:51:56,514 --> 01:51:57,975
Behind Wendy's, they're meeting right now,

1280
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:00,531
you know, the Locust Street project.

1281
01:52:00,571 --> 01:52:15,240
So we definitely need some work to be done with regards to building in Medford and what we see, what is our vision with regards to just throwing up hundreds of apartment units and congesting our streets and roadways.

1282
01:52:16,341 --> 01:52:19,143
With that being said, I'm just not happy.

1283
01:52:19,183 --> 01:52:29,009
We have 24 boards and commissions in this city, 24, made up of multiple people, whether it be a three-person board up to a nine-person board.

1284
01:52:29,427 --> 01:52:36,192
And the only board or commission that is getting a raise in this year's budget is the Zoning Board of Appeals.

1285
01:52:36,872 --> 01:52:38,073
I don't find that fair.

1286
01:52:38,774 --> 01:52:42,236
I find it ironic almost.

1287
01:52:42,657 --> 01:52:47,220
But I think that definitely raised some concerns.

1288
01:52:48,681 --> 01:52:51,483
With regards to the Board of Health, we're behind in inspections.

1289
01:52:51,523 --> 01:52:56,987
We need to get up to date on that, whether we need to hire more in that office or we just need to get it together.

1290
01:53:00,038 --> 01:53:04,221
The parking program, I know there are a number of minor changes to that.

1291
01:53:04,301 --> 01:53:08,325
And one that I was not happy about was the $25 charge to seniors.

1292
01:53:08,525 --> 01:53:13,269
If a senior citizen wants a pass, they have to pay $25 for the year.

1293
01:53:13,709 --> 01:53:18,873
In some respects, if it's very well used, that's going to be, you know, obviously a great purchase.

1294
01:53:18,953 --> 01:53:25,939
But I think that's something that we should have been able to give our money we're making from Republic Parking and the parking enforcement program.

1295
01:53:25,959 --> 01:53:28,541
I feel like that's something we'd be able to give our seniors for free.

1296
01:53:30,005 --> 01:53:31,745
Our police department is understaffed.

1297
01:53:31,966 --> 01:53:36,327
We've had the robocall that went out this week, rash of robberies.

1298
01:53:37,047 --> 01:53:43,628
You talk to officers and there's just talk about, you know, the overdoses and the situations we're facing and what they have to deal with.

1299
01:53:44,068 --> 01:53:46,369
We have six cars on overnight.

1300
01:53:46,429 --> 01:53:53,631
So if you have something going on in Wellington, you have four cars rushing to Wellington and you have two cars patrolling the rest of the community.

1301
01:53:53,771 --> 01:53:59,392
I think it's time we add to our police force, you know, not just the four to cover retirements,

1302
01:53:59,738 --> 01:54:01,138
but to beef it up a little bit.

1303
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:05,840
And I think that's something that, you know, I think we made that recommendation.

1304
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:10,802
It's, again, frustrating that all of our recommendations, nothing I think was put into this budget.

1305
01:54:12,302 --> 01:54:15,243
Then to talk about the automobiles for the officers.

1306
01:54:16,764 --> 01:54:26,407
If we are going to free up those nine people, we really need to look at replacing, and we talk about it all the time, figuring out a way to replace three automobiles at a time each year.

1307
01:54:29,882 --> 01:54:31,242
I spoke about the capital plan.

1308
01:54:31,282 --> 01:54:32,583
I would have liked to have seen that.

1309
01:54:33,203 --> 01:54:42,445
I'm happy about this video streaming, but the number of complaints I get with regards to people watching these meetings, I think we need a new system.

1310
01:54:42,485 --> 01:54:46,085
And I've asked for just a quote on that, and we weren't able to get one before tonight.

1311
01:54:47,006 --> 01:54:48,066
We have no grant writer.

1312
01:54:48,326 --> 01:54:55,127
We have no leak detection program that the Water and Sewer Commission approved probably about a year, almost a year ago now.

1313
01:54:57,028 --> 01:54:57,928
With regards, I think

1314
01:54:58,328 --> 01:55:04,970
I think others will comment on this, but the $400,000 that the city and the schools use for water, I think that should be in the city budget.

1315
01:55:04,990 --> 01:55:07,431
I think you're just double taxing the rate payer.

1316
01:55:08,791 --> 01:55:15,154
And with regards to just the simple request to get a speed limit monitoring sign, we have one, and ours is broken.

1317
01:55:15,634 --> 01:55:25,877
It's probably the number one complaint I get with regards to speeding, and that removable sign does...

1318
01:55:28,730 --> 01:55:30,931
It's definitely worth it, and we don't have one that's working.

1319
01:55:31,031 --> 01:55:34,872
Ours has been broken for a long time, and we have no end in sight.

1320
01:55:36,893 --> 01:55:43,715
Before I start talking about the schools, I want to fully disclose that I have a written disclosure in the city clerk's office.

1321
01:55:43,775 --> 01:55:47,937
I actually sent an updated one in last night, slipped it under the door.

1322
01:55:49,577 --> 01:55:54,379
My mother works for the school department, and so does my sister, so I want to make that full disclosure.

1323
01:55:57,460 --> 01:56:07,562
I think with regards to the kindergarten aids that was brought up, one great thing that has happened to the schools is the security.

1324
01:56:07,602 --> 01:56:13,983
There's been a huge change in security within the last four months, and I want to thank the school committee and superintendent for handling that.

1325
01:56:14,063 --> 01:56:21,045
Now, every time you go into a school, you have to show your ID, the doors are locked, you have to get buzzed in, show your ID, wear a badge.

1326
01:56:21,225 --> 01:56:23,525
It's definitely much, I feel much safer.

1327
01:56:23,545 --> 01:56:26,846
I do it when I go into my child's school, and I do it when I go into the high school.

1328
01:56:27,533 --> 01:56:28,914
I think that's definitely a positive.

1329
01:56:30,455 --> 01:56:42,105
Paying for the Field of Dreams bond on the city side now, where it's always been on the school side, I didn't understand why that's happening, but that's something that the administration has decided wants to be done.

1330
01:56:43,486 --> 01:56:50,352
Kindergarten aides, very, very happy that there are additional kindergarten aides and that we're putting them in full-time.

1331
01:56:50,552 --> 01:56:56,837
I know that Roberts is where my children go, and there are going to be four full-time kindergarten aides, and I think that's wonderful.

1332
01:56:57,452 --> 01:57:06,057
What I think is highly unfair is that there are five classrooms within the city at the three other elementary schools that are not going to have full-time kindergarten aides.

1333
01:57:06,157 --> 01:57:11,240
And I think that's something that should have been looked at in depth.

1334
01:57:11,300 --> 01:57:18,224
And I know at the Brooks School, the teachers did request full-time kindergarten aides, and I believe one or two were not given.

1335
01:57:20,505 --> 01:57:24,167
With regards to school maintenance, I think we got a lengthy, lengthy report.

1336
01:57:25,473 --> 01:57:28,215
on all the school maintenance we need to have done.

1337
01:57:29,696 --> 01:57:36,741
Very detailed report based on each school, Curtis, McGlynn, Medford High, broken down.

1338
01:57:36,881 --> 01:57:40,283
And we're talking millions of dollars in maintenance that these schools need.

1339
01:57:40,684 --> 01:57:48,969
And I don't think that the $400,000 for a high school and all of our other elementary and middle schools is enough.

1340
01:57:49,950 --> 01:57:52,572
I've been getting, even within the last week I've gotten

1341
01:57:53,730 --> 01:58:01,334
I've emailed pictures of just broken lights, broken door.

1342
01:58:01,394 --> 01:58:03,095
I've had it at three different schools.

1343
01:58:03,495 --> 01:58:05,156
You have the people talking now.

1344
01:58:05,356 --> 01:58:11,560
People are definitely contacting the city councilors and the school committee and not afraid to open up about their concerns.

1345
01:58:12,020 --> 01:58:15,122
And I think maintenance is a huge, something we really need to tackle.

1346
01:58:15,962 --> 01:58:20,905
I know the cleaning service that we do hire for Medford High, and I believe the McGlynn

1347
01:58:21,459 --> 01:58:23,360
I was told they don't have enough trash bags.

1348
01:58:23,641 --> 01:58:27,123
We're not giving them enough trash bags because we do provide the trash bags.

1349
01:58:28,384 --> 01:58:37,411
No security after 3.30 on the weekends and expecting parents and coaches to patrol and secure our schools I think is unsafe.

1350
01:58:37,911 --> 01:58:42,595
And I think that's definitely something that we should be adding to the budget.

1351
01:58:43,916 --> 01:58:47,078
Last year I did vote for the budget a number of years in a row.

1352
01:58:47,118 --> 01:58:49,240
And last year I did vote against the budget.

1353
01:58:49,627 --> 01:58:55,691
in its entirety because I believe the schools are too top-heavy, and I know one administrative position has been eliminated this year.

1354
01:58:56,312 --> 01:59:06,598
So that's obviously, I think my concern was valid last year, and I think it probably should be taken more seriously.

1355
01:59:07,339 --> 01:59:19,207
And then we go hire a PR rep for 90,000, nothing against the actual person who took the job, but I think that kindergarten aides are far more important

1356
01:59:19,707 --> 01:59:28,349
and maintenance and security are far more important, far more needed in the Medford Public Schools than a blog and an email that you get once a month.

1357
01:59:28,369 --> 01:59:30,749
And that's just my personal opinion.

1358
01:59:30,809 --> 01:59:32,429
Everybody can agree to disagree.

1359
01:59:32,469 --> 01:59:37,010
But a lot of people in the community are pretty upset about it and have voiced their concerns.

1360
01:59:37,230 --> 01:59:46,992
And just I feel like we could hire somebody with a stipend for whether that be $5,000 or $10,000 to do a blog and send out weekly emails.

1361
01:59:50,668 --> 01:59:58,552
Lastly, there was a concern raised with regards to somebody, the head of speech living in Florida.

1362
01:59:58,572 --> 02:00:00,653
It was brought to my attention by multiple people.

1363
02:00:01,294 --> 02:00:13,400
And when I asked the question where in the budget this person was, because I know it's been the last two years, and this year it's kind of brought grave concern to people.

1364
02:00:14,786 --> 02:00:27,057
I was yelled at by the superintendent with regards to, I believe, just not to answer my question, I was yelled at by the superintendent that there was a conflict and I shouldn't even be talking about it.

1365
02:00:27,077 --> 02:00:32,422
Madam Vice President, can we maybe just not use such an inflammatory term?

1366
02:00:32,562 --> 02:00:33,122
Inflammatory?

1367
02:00:34,143 --> 02:00:34,624
It's the truth.

1368
02:00:44,935 --> 02:00:48,738
So I question what the right answer is with this vote for the budget.

1369
02:00:48,918 --> 02:00:49,899
I see the positives.

1370
02:00:49,959 --> 02:00:50,760
I see the negatives.

1371
02:00:51,080 --> 02:00:52,581
I think it's very hard.

1372
02:00:52,621 --> 02:00:54,362
I like to hear what my colleagues have to say.

1373
02:00:55,143 --> 02:01:00,887
But I just wanted to voice my concerns and give my rundown.

1374
02:01:01,167 --> 02:01:01,448
Thank you.

1375
02:01:12,296 --> 02:01:13,957
Citizen wishes to approach the podium.

1376
02:01:14,630 --> 02:01:20,355
Doctor, please come forward, state your name and address for the record.

1377
02:01:20,775 --> 02:01:21,776
Thank you, Mr. President.

1378
02:01:22,156 --> 02:01:23,577
My name is John Storella.

1379
02:01:24,278 --> 02:01:27,340
I reside at 20 Metcalf Street in Medford.

1380
02:01:28,401 --> 02:01:35,227
And I just want to begin by saying that, as you know, in the past, I've attended several budget sessions.

1381
02:01:36,083 --> 02:01:42,408
And what I want to do is try to lend some clarification to the process, if I may.

1382
02:01:42,969 --> 02:01:49,534
I know that the council, the city council itself, does not need my comments on this.

1383
02:01:49,834 --> 02:01:51,375
They are all aware of the process.

1384
02:01:52,636 --> 02:02:01,303
But the taxpaying public out there is a group that I'm really addressing these comments to, so they may understand the process.

1385
02:02:02,304 --> 02:02:03,925
And I want to begin by saying that

1386
02:02:05,444 --> 02:02:16,211
It is so, so sad, Mr. President, that the city council must repeat this ritual year after year after year, with no progress for the people.

1387
02:02:18,092 --> 02:02:20,093
It serves only to raise their taxes.

1388
02:02:22,415 --> 02:02:31,941
For those who don't know, Medford, the city of Medford, is really run by an oligarchy.

1389
02:02:33,562 --> 02:02:34,863
The people want democracy.

1390
02:02:36,029 --> 02:02:37,270
but they are not going to get it.

1391
02:02:39,511 --> 02:02:41,032
How important is democracy?

1392
02:02:42,933 --> 02:02:44,794
Democracy is everything.

1393
02:02:46,736 --> 02:03:01,985
The council has heard the heads of the department tell it of their needs, and the council is also aware of the waste, fraud, and abuse in the budget, yet it will approve the budget with no changes.

1394
02:03:03,930 --> 02:03:11,413
That is what the city council has done for the past 28 years and will do again for the 29th year.

1395
02:03:12,733 --> 02:03:25,138
The city council will approve the 2017 budget as submitted by the mayor and the struggling people will be separated from more of their money.

1396
02:03:27,639 --> 02:03:32,721
Let's try to understand the budget process for the taxpayers out there.

1397
02:03:34,328 --> 02:03:42,613
According to our plan a charter, only the mayor can submit the budget of 56,000 people in Medford.

1398
02:03:43,073 --> 02:03:47,936
Only one, the mayor can determine what goes into the annual budget.

1399
02:03:49,837 --> 02:03:50,917
How is that for power?

1400
02:03:53,439 --> 02:04:02,504
So anyway, uh, once submitted by the mayor, the budget can be approved only by you, the city council.

1401
02:04:03,765 --> 02:04:05,506
The council has two other options.

1402
02:04:06,426 --> 02:04:11,989
One, reduce a line item, or two, reject a line item.

1403
02:04:13,230 --> 02:04:20,134
The council cannot reduce or reject a particular amount as specified in the expanded explanation.

1404
02:04:21,154 --> 02:04:31,680
It can reduce or reject a line item amount as the line item was submitted by the mayor and the mayor and line

1405
02:04:32,591 --> 02:04:37,233
pardon me, by the mayor and the mayor submitted each department as a line item.

1406
02:04:38,133 --> 02:04:41,175
So a whole department must be reduced.

1407
02:04:42,816 --> 02:04:44,957
No city council wants to do that.

1408
02:04:46,337 --> 02:04:47,578
Last year's 2016 budget was $155 million.

1409
02:04:47,618 --> 02:04:50,239
This year's 2017 budget is $162 million, an increase of four

1410
02:05:00,938 --> 02:05:06,560
4.5%.

1411
02:05:00,978 --> 02:05:06,560
I want to be very precise about that.

1412
02:05:06,580 --> 02:05:06,560
4.5%.

1413
02:05:07,821 --> 02:05:10,642
How do the mayor and the city council justify that?

1414
02:05:12,203 --> 02:05:14,764
No one gets 4.5% these days.

1415
02:05:15,644 --> 02:05:18,645
The whole United States economy grew by only 2%.

1416
02:05:21,946 --> 02:05:24,747
A 10-year treasury bond yields only 1.6%.

1417
02:05:27,755 --> 02:05:31,817
The Federal Reserve Bank has a rate of only one quarter of 1%.

1418
02:05:31,997 --> 02:05:39,621
Now, why does this Medford government need 4.5% more in order to cope?

1419
02:05:40,401 --> 02:05:46,344
And the people of Medford who are paying that 4.5% in taxes must exist on less.

1420
02:05:47,664 --> 02:05:57,369
By serving the people, the council would be serving their constituents, their friends, their neighbors, their children,

1421
02:05:58,075 --> 02:05:59,135
and their grandchildren.

1422
02:06:01,496 --> 02:06:10,758
Of the $162 million in the budget, 80% of $130 million will be the cost of personnel compensation.

1423
02:06:11,858 --> 02:06:17,900
The cost for each and every public employee on average is $93,000 annually.

1424
02:06:18,020 --> 02:06:19,780
That 4.5% budget increase costs every man

1425
02:06:26,979 --> 02:06:31,981
woman and child in Medford, $125 more annually.

1426
02:06:32,601 --> 02:06:38,203
For household of four, that is $500 more in taxes.

1427
02:06:40,604 --> 02:06:50,408
So the people in paying this money are expecting services.

1428
02:06:50,948 --> 02:06:56,010
Now, what are the basic services that the people are paying for that we are not getting?

1429
02:06:57,442 --> 02:07:15,253
sidewalk repairs, pothole repairs, tree trunk removal, pedestrian crosswalks painted, underground pipe repairs, reasonable parking costs, street sweeping.

1430
02:07:17,375 --> 02:07:18,195
This is a great one.

1431
02:07:19,436 --> 02:07:27,181
Public room sanitation, public bathroom, that is, public toilet sanitation, police staffing,

1432
02:07:28,333 --> 02:07:41,856
library renovation, how about stopping, stopping the circumventing of proposition two and a half control of waste fraud and abuse and charter review.

1433
02:07:43,376 --> 02:07:45,117
Now there's a great one charter reviews.

1434
02:07:46,177 --> 02:07:49,797
We saw how that was shot down up on beacon Hill just two weeks ago.

1435
02:07:53,178 --> 02:07:56,819
And there are rumors that the

1436
02:07:57,754 --> 02:08:01,257
Politicians in Medford gave some aid to that result.

1437
02:08:03,558 --> 02:08:25,514
Some of the subjects to be discussed by the people in a charter review are ward representation, term limits, larger city council, voter initiatives, voter recall, school committee chairman, city auditor appointed by the council.

1438
02:08:27,193 --> 02:08:27,913
and many others.

1439
02:08:31,175 --> 02:08:36,358
But our Medford City government does not really want charter review.

1440
02:08:39,499 --> 02:08:46,302
So getting back to the beginning of my talk, how important is democracy?

1441
02:08:47,663 --> 02:08:49,584
Democracy is everything.

1442
02:08:52,005 --> 02:08:53,286
Thank you very much, Councilors.

1443
02:09:04,765 --> 02:09:05,225
Good evening.

1444
02:09:05,385 --> 02:09:07,206
Please state your name and address for the record.

1445
02:09:07,886 --> 02:09:09,887
My name is Christopher Donovan for Lorraine Road.

1446
02:09:09,907 --> 02:09:11,587
I just want to thank that gentleman.

1447
02:09:11,607 --> 02:09:17,069
That was a very powerful and heartfelt statement full of facts I think echoed by a lot of people in Medford.

1448
02:09:17,889 --> 02:09:22,210
It came down tonight because I wanted to go to the zoning board of appeals to see how the process worked.

1449
02:09:22,410 --> 02:09:30,833
I want to thank them for that very difficult job and the very thoughtful process they had of listening to both sides of so many issues I heard tonight.

1450
02:09:31,253 --> 02:09:34,274
It's a difficult job and I heard a dozen different stories and

1451
02:09:34,879 --> 02:09:39,400
I can't imagine how they side on either way, because it's very difficult.

1452
02:09:39,900 --> 02:09:44,641
I'm very against the 61 Locust Street project, but that's a difficult job, and I applaud them for that job.

1453
02:09:44,661 --> 02:09:50,842
I want to say thank you for some of the councilors who stepped up last night and helped with a little pool pass situation at Tufts Pool.

1454
02:09:51,262 --> 02:09:59,124
Very small little thing, but a lot of you reached out and who I reached out to and responded admirably, and I thank you, and it was good results.

1455
02:09:59,324 --> 02:10:03,305
Small little thing, but a lot of people realized little steps, so thank you all for that.

1456
02:10:03,810 --> 02:10:07,433
And the thing I'm here for today to speak is the budget for the Medford High School band.

1457
02:10:08,133 --> 02:10:10,155
I know it's a difficult position for budget right now.

1458
02:10:10,175 --> 02:10:19,982
A lot of money, a lot of tension, a lot of different issues going on, but that band is just one of those things that we should kind of keep close to the heart, fund a little bit, support a little bit, champion it.

1459
02:10:20,443 --> 02:10:21,003
It's the kids.

1460
02:10:21,203 --> 02:10:23,185
We see drugs, problems, crime.

1461
02:10:23,645 --> 02:10:24,846
That's a great little program.

1462
02:10:24,886 --> 02:10:25,727
The budget gets cut.

1463
02:10:25,927 --> 02:10:30,010
People don't think of it too much, but they show up at all our different events and they kind of give it their all.

1464
02:10:30,431 --> 02:10:31,091
Keep them in mind.

1465
02:10:31,351 --> 02:10:31,992
Thank you for your time.

1466
02:10:35,285 --> 02:10:36,085
Thank you, citizen.

1467
02:10:39,766 --> 02:10:40,246
Good evening.

1468
02:10:40,406 --> 02:10:43,286
Please state your name and address for the record.

1469
02:10:43,526 --> 02:10:44,507
Good evening, city council.

1470
02:10:44,527 --> 02:10:48,027
My name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Mass.

1471
02:10:49,447 --> 02:10:54,748
And I'm kind of shocked that there's not a ton of people in here tonight for something as important as the budget.

1472
02:10:55,528 --> 02:10:56,089
That's number one.

1473
02:10:56,229 --> 02:11:04,310
I heard Mrs. Baker say something about public access funds allocated for something or other for the city.

1474
02:11:07,517 --> 02:11:08,437
Every week it's amazing.

1475
02:11:08,537 --> 02:11:10,118
I have this power, amazing power.

1476
02:11:10,658 --> 02:11:18,861
So I'm wondering if the public access funds are being utilized by the city, why has it been two years since our city solicitor said he was investigating TV3?

1477
02:11:19,421 --> 02:11:20,741
I want to know where those monies are.

1478
02:11:21,101 --> 02:11:24,602
For this city budget, this room would be packed if we had access TV.

1479
02:11:25,403 --> 02:11:26,603
It would be absolutely packed.

1480
02:11:26,743 --> 02:11:28,003
We don't have access TV.

1481
02:11:28,324 --> 02:11:32,885
We're hearing it's going to be at the school in October when there's a critical election coming up.

1482
02:11:33,915 --> 02:11:35,776
I could install a TV station yesterday.

1483
02:11:35,856 --> 02:11:36,576
It's so easy.

1484
02:11:36,616 --> 02:11:38,737
You don't need to hook up to cable wires anymore.

1485
02:11:39,138 --> 02:11:40,778
You can do it over the cellular phones.

1486
02:11:41,218 --> 02:11:42,079
It is so simple.

1487
02:11:43,039 --> 02:11:45,220
We are in the year 2016.

1488
02:11:45,841 --> 02:11:49,082
This isn't 1984 anymore when you have to dig up the ground.

1489
02:11:49,803 --> 02:11:54,165
So here we are, an important budget, but this city seems to love secrecy.

1490
02:11:54,285 --> 02:11:55,285
It loves censorship.

1491
02:11:55,325 --> 02:11:57,046
This city is all about censorship.

1492
02:11:57,881 --> 02:12:01,022
And the People's Forum is the only place we have to go to speak.

1493
02:12:01,582 --> 02:12:05,783
So, I would like to have specifics about what Mrs. Baker talked about.

1494
02:12:05,803 --> 02:12:11,844
I'll put in a public records request to know where this public access money is going, because it is not going to public access.

1495
02:12:12,285 --> 02:12:17,126
If the city wants to use access funds, it should give the citizens what they pay for.

1496
02:12:17,466 --> 02:12:18,706
They pay for public access.

1497
02:12:18,726 --> 02:12:20,066
They don't have public access.

1498
02:12:20,146 --> 02:12:20,987
No one's in this room.

1499
02:12:21,427 --> 02:12:23,527
There are nine people here and some city officials.

1500
02:12:24,007 --> 02:12:24,868
That's disgraceful.

1501
02:12:25,888 --> 02:12:26,608
This is a budget.

1502
02:12:27,585 --> 02:12:38,433
This is the city of Medford, and I would like to see some city councils get proactive on this and really complain because it's been two years since we were assured by the city solicitor that he would look into it.

1503
02:12:38,493 --> 02:12:46,799
He gave them two weeks, 20 days, two years have gone by, and the citizens are supposed to just take the slap in the face and walk away and be happy.

1504
02:12:47,879 --> 02:12:48,500
It's not fair.

1505
02:12:48,980 --> 02:12:50,281
We want to be treated fairly.

1506
02:12:50,381 --> 02:12:51,382
We pay for something.

1507
02:12:52,363 --> 02:12:53,403
We want that something.

1508
02:12:53,944 --> 02:12:54,304
Thank you.

1509
02:13:19,361 --> 02:13:19,961
Councillor Knight.

1510
02:13:20,782 --> 02:13:28,047
Mr. President, it seems like everybody said what they have to say at this point in time, and unless I'm wrong, I'd like to make a motion to end all debate.

1511
02:13:28,948 --> 02:13:29,468
I'll take a vote.

1512
02:13:30,229 --> 02:13:35,212
On the motion of Councillor Knight to end all debate and take a vote.

1513
02:13:35,552 --> 02:13:36,373
All those in favour?

1514
02:13:36,793 --> 02:13:37,694
All those opposed?

1515
02:13:37,774 --> 02:13:40,096
Is there a motion for approval of the budget?

1516
02:13:40,376 --> 02:13:43,198
That requires a two-third roll call vote to end all debate, Mr. President.

1517
02:13:43,498 --> 02:13:43,898
I'm sorry?

1518
02:13:44,058 --> 02:13:46,000
Requires a two-third roll call vote to end all debate.

1519
02:13:47,708 --> 02:13:49,590
A roll call vote, two-thirds roll call vote.

1520
02:13:49,630 --> 02:13:50,550
It requires a two-thirds, yes.

1521
02:13:50,850 --> 02:13:51,231
It does.

1522
02:13:51,631 --> 02:13:54,153
So on that motion, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1523
02:13:54,513 --> 02:13:55,193
Counselor Mox.

1524
02:13:55,514 --> 02:13:57,655
Mr. President, thank you.

1525
02:13:58,136 --> 02:14:06,081
I actually have a few comments and I didn't know if someone else from the audience, I thought that you, which you were waiting for, for people from the audience to get up.

1526
02:14:06,141 --> 02:14:08,023
No, I was waiting for the councilors.

1527
02:14:13,327 --> 02:14:18,008
We're discussing right now the two-thirds vote to end all debate.

1528
02:14:18,408 --> 02:14:19,748
The motion is on the floor.

1529
02:14:22,069 --> 02:14:24,469
You wish to address the council on the budget, sir?

1530
02:14:24,749 --> 02:14:25,070
Yes.

1531
02:14:26,730 --> 02:14:29,951
Actually, no, it's not on the budget.

1532
02:14:29,991 --> 02:14:31,951
However, it's partially on the budget.

1533
02:14:32,891 --> 02:14:36,132
I want to say, and this may shock you,

1534
02:14:39,928 --> 02:14:48,413
However, I've been to a lot of these budget meetings that all you counselors have been to in the last few months, it seems like.

1535
02:14:50,655 --> 02:14:56,799
And I never realized how much work that you, lady and gentlemen, put in.

1536
02:14:58,600 --> 02:14:59,420
It's astounding.

1537
02:15:01,062 --> 02:15:06,485
So if I may, I'd like to commend you on all the hard work, and it's incredible.

1538
02:15:07,688 --> 02:15:11,231
I really, I've never realized it was that intensive.

1539
02:15:13,333 --> 02:15:15,675
I don't have the budget myself.

1540
02:15:17,356 --> 02:15:19,938
I'm not privy or I just don't have it.

1541
02:15:20,879 --> 02:15:22,721
So therefore, I didn't read it.

1542
02:15:22,901 --> 02:15:32,709
Matter of fact, if I had it, I probably would have a hard time reading it because I have learning disabilities and a head injury, not to sound like Dr. Woods.

1543
02:15:34,991 --> 02:15:35,492
However,

1544
02:15:36,656 --> 02:15:40,258
I probably have a better chance of reading the Bible instead.

1545
02:15:41,359 --> 02:15:51,626
But if it was in my power, I would automatically give all you counselors a 50% pay increase on a yearly basis.

1546
02:15:52,667 --> 02:15:53,688
I honestly would.

1547
02:15:54,368 --> 02:15:58,091
Even though you might be, you might be, are you interested?

1548
02:15:58,591 --> 02:16:03,134
You may be the second highest paid study counselors in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts after

1549
02:16:03,550 --> 02:16:06,351
or the third, or the fourth.

1550
02:16:06,531 --> 02:16:11,194
Out of 351 communities, I'm sure you're in the top 5%, which would be the top 15.

1551
02:16:11,874 --> 02:16:32,904
But actually, I would actually double your salaries if you would, this December, when you set the tax rate, as Brianna looks and smiles, give me what they have in Somerville, Everett, and Malden, the owner occupied 20% real estate tax savings.

1552
02:16:33,609 --> 02:16:34,589
for the owner occupied.

1553
02:16:34,869 --> 02:16:45,172
If you live in one house only, and the city will still get their levy of $104 million, they would not lose a dollar of tax.

1554
02:16:45,532 --> 02:16:57,235
It would just be shifted to all others, multiple real estate owners, whether they're Lemire apartment buildings, Meadow Glen malls, Wegmans, or whatever that is.

1555
02:16:57,855 --> 02:17:00,296
They would not lose a dime, but yet,

1556
02:17:01,344 --> 02:17:03,485
Somerville, Everett, and Malden does this.

1557
02:17:04,065 --> 02:17:13,228
And I won't even mention that Somerville gets 35% with a special exclusion permission, I should say, from the state.

1558
02:17:13,328 --> 02:17:26,391
So I hope this December I would like to double your salary if we could just get the owner-occupied real estate tax exemption at the 20% under the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Chapter 56.

1559
02:17:28,996 --> 02:17:31,698
Law Section 5C.

1560
02:17:32,118 --> 02:17:34,420
I'll see you in December.

1561
02:17:35,041 --> 02:17:41,065
However, if you're going to go on hiatus in the next few months, I wish you all a happy, safe summer.

1562
02:17:41,525 --> 02:17:42,466
Thank you for listening.

1563
02:17:42,686 --> 02:17:43,007
Thank you, sir.

1564
02:17:43,027 --> 02:17:44,588
Mr. President and councillors.

1565
02:17:44,968 --> 02:17:45,308
Thank you.

1566
02:17:46,709 --> 02:17:53,214
On the motion of Councillor Knight to end all suspension, Mr. Clerk, call to discuss all- I withdraw.

1567
02:17:53,314 --> 02:17:56,637
Councillor Marks has some comments that he'd like to add relative to the budget deliberation.

1568
02:17:57,103 --> 02:17:58,443
Councilman Marks, you have the floor.

1569
02:17:58,524 --> 02:17:58,904
Welcome.

1570
02:18:00,704 --> 02:18:01,745
Thank you, Mr. President.

1571
02:18:02,465 --> 02:18:03,645
We still have Anne Baker here.

1572
02:18:03,925 --> 02:18:05,126
Anne, I have a question for you.

1573
02:18:13,189 --> 02:18:14,209
I'm sorry, Mr. Baker.

1574
02:18:14,289 --> 02:18:15,870
Do I have to yell?

1575
02:18:15,890 --> 02:18:16,570
I'm going to yell.

1576
02:18:17,070 --> 02:18:20,611
Anne, is the proposed city budget on the city website?

1577
02:18:22,052 --> 02:18:22,712
I do not know.

1578
02:18:24,633 --> 02:18:25,013
You don't know?

1579
02:18:25,393 --> 02:18:25,473
No.

1580
02:18:29,372 --> 02:18:34,473
How is one supposed to know what's in the proposed budget?

1581
02:18:35,193 --> 02:18:41,175
Other than the council, the 56,000 people that are out there, how are they supposed to know what's in the proposed budget?

1582
02:18:41,495 --> 02:18:45,595
Let me ask if Mr. Palmino.

1583
02:18:46,236 --> 02:18:47,196
He's the city solicitor.

1584
02:18:47,236 --> 02:18:48,136
Is he the budget director?

1585
02:18:50,717 --> 02:18:51,837
They said he's the city solicitor.

1586
02:18:51,857 --> 02:18:52,737
Is he the budget director?

1587
02:18:55,260 --> 02:18:57,441
Is there some confusion, Councillor?

1588
02:18:58,762 --> 02:19:00,823
I asked the budget director a question.

1589
02:19:00,903 --> 02:19:03,805
If I was the budget director, I thought perhaps you were confused.

1590
02:19:04,125 --> 02:19:05,126
No, I'm not confused.

1591
02:19:05,366 --> 02:19:07,187
Oh, I'm not so sure.

1592
02:19:07,207 --> 02:19:11,929
I asked the woman that was up there if this was on the city website.

1593
02:19:11,949 --> 02:19:15,471
No, you think you asked if the city solicitor was the budget director, if I'm not mistaken.

1594
02:19:15,491 --> 02:19:16,592
We could rerun the tape.

1595
02:19:16,652 --> 02:19:18,333
Because she asked for your opinion on this.

1596
02:19:18,373 --> 02:19:19,874
This doesn't require a legal opinion.

1597
02:19:20,394 --> 02:19:23,776
No, but there's many things that don't require a legal opinion that end up that way.

1598
02:19:24,076 --> 02:19:25,156
Thank you for your comments.

1599
02:19:25,296 --> 02:19:26,537
You're welcome.

1600
02:19:26,657 --> 02:19:27,697
I'm talking to Ian Baker now.

1601
02:19:27,757 --> 02:19:28,077
Thank you.

1602
02:19:28,457 --> 02:19:29,037
I do not know.

1603
02:19:29,057 --> 02:19:36,499
I do not know if it was on, if it's on the website, as you know, the, the position of budget director was interrupted with the resignation of the budget director.

1604
02:19:36,519 --> 02:19:42,160
So the budget process has been slightly disjointed as council Longo alluded to the before.

1605
02:19:42,260 --> 02:19:44,481
So I do not know if it's on the website.

1606
02:19:44,581 --> 02:19:46,001
It is not on the city website.

1607
02:19:46,341 --> 02:19:46,541
Okay.

1608
02:19:46,982 --> 02:19:52,763
So we have $162 million budget and the mayor brags about transparency.

1609
02:19:53,337 --> 02:20:01,600
Under this administration, we're talking transparency and there's not one indication of this proposed budget anywhere on the city website.

1610
02:20:02,841 --> 02:20:05,401
And it's like I said, it's been on the, it's been on the council agenda.

1611
02:20:05,461 --> 02:20:15,845
I know we have the superintendent of schools here and I would ask the same question to the superintendent of schools is the proposed school budget on the school website.

1612
02:20:17,446 --> 02:20:18,806
No, it is not.

1613
02:20:19,767 --> 02:20:20,487
Thank you very much.

1614
02:20:22,437 --> 02:20:34,125
So here we have the mayor bragging about transparency and open government in a proposed budget of $162 million.

1615
02:20:34,765 --> 02:20:37,988
Residents have nowhere to find this document.

1616
02:20:39,168 --> 02:20:43,471
Sure, they can come to a committee of the whole meeting up here, absolutely.

1617
02:20:43,811 --> 02:20:50,676
They can come to one of the seven or eight meetings we had, but they can't go online and find the proposed budget.

1618
02:20:53,200 --> 02:21:01,446
I believe that this document, the amended budget, which we received, it was posted online amidst all the other articles we get on our agenda.

1619
02:21:01,486 --> 02:21:08,370
And the original budget, which is $8,000 less than this, was certainly part of the agenda that we received on June 4th.

1620
02:21:08,390 --> 02:21:11,252
If you can find that on the city website, I'd like to see you find that.

1621
02:21:12,473 --> 02:21:13,854
So I'll get back to my comments.

1622
02:21:16,740 --> 02:21:23,003
It's been on, it's been addressed, it was presented to the council on June, what was the first day it was presented to the council.

1623
02:21:23,023 --> 02:21:25,884
So it's been on the agenda for several weeks sitting here, right?

1624
02:21:26,224 --> 02:21:31,026
And I think the policy in the city has been that it goes on the website after it's approved.

1625
02:21:31,627 --> 02:21:32,427
After it's approved.

1626
02:21:32,527 --> 02:21:33,688
That has been the practice.

1627
02:21:33,728 --> 02:21:34,408
Thank you, Anna.

1628
02:21:34,448 --> 02:21:35,268
Thank you for your comments.

1629
02:21:37,229 --> 02:21:38,750
That's great for transparency.

1630
02:21:38,770 --> 02:21:41,131
We're going to put the budget on after it's approved.

1631
02:21:43,162 --> 02:21:44,003
That is great.

1632
02:21:44,083 --> 02:21:46,125
That's a great comment to have.

1633
02:21:46,905 --> 02:21:57,754
And let me just start off by saying, and my colleagues are entitled to their opinion, I've been on this council 14 years, and this is the worst budget process I've ever been through.

1634
02:21:58,395 --> 02:22:00,877
The worst budget process in 14 years.

1635
02:22:01,817 --> 02:22:09,864
We've had countless meetings, and we've been unable to ask questions at these meetings because the administration sent staff

1636
02:22:10,623 --> 02:22:13,104
that were unable to answer budget questions.

1637
02:22:13,945 --> 02:22:14,865
And I don't fault them.

1638
02:22:15,526 --> 02:22:16,766
They're not budget people.

1639
02:22:18,527 --> 02:22:23,150
And, you know, it was stated by a counselor earlier that, you know, this was a great year.

1640
02:22:23,190 --> 02:22:24,771
We had a ton of questions this year.

1641
02:22:25,391 --> 02:22:31,395
We had a ton of questions because there was no one to answer questions from the administration over the last several weeks.

1642
02:22:31,995 --> 02:22:33,636
That doesn't make for a good process.

1643
02:22:35,237 --> 02:22:39,299
So that's my first comment, that the lack of transparency

1644
02:22:39,846 --> 02:22:41,787
and the lack of this administration.

1645
02:22:41,807 --> 02:22:51,150
You know, if the administration wanted to send a budget person, Mayor Burke was the budget person in this city for the last five years and created this budget.

1646
02:22:51,970 --> 02:22:59,513
So if she wanted to send a budget person, she should have found herself at these particular meetings to answer questions.

1647
02:22:59,533 --> 02:23:09,476
$162 million of taxpayer money that this council got some answers to, some half-hearted answers, and some that weren't answered at all, in my opinion.

1648
02:23:12,307 --> 02:23:16,410
Second point I had is, yes, there's a lot of good things in this budget.

1649
02:23:16,650 --> 02:23:17,191
Absolutely.

1650
02:23:17,311 --> 02:23:23,755
I agree with the addition in the Office of Community Development, the two planning positions.

1651
02:23:24,456 --> 02:23:28,258
I agree with some of the moves that were made in some of the various departments.

1652
02:23:28,739 --> 02:23:32,201
I think we have a school budget that, in my opinion, looks fine.

1653
02:23:32,582 --> 02:23:36,304
And I'll talk about the security like I did with the superintendent last week.

1654
02:23:36,865 --> 02:23:41,628
And I hope he gives the same answers he gave last week, because I think people find it quite eye-opening.

1655
02:23:42,562 --> 02:23:44,063
some of the responses that I received.

1656
02:23:44,563 --> 02:23:56,927
But I'd like to go through, you know, we went through the highlights, and I'd like to go through some of the lowlights that, you know, were offered by members of this council, and things that we feel strongly about.

1657
02:23:57,307 --> 02:23:59,747
And I asked this at one of the budget meetings.

1658
02:24:00,248 --> 02:24:04,069
I said to the council directly, I said, who had impact in this budget?

1659
02:24:04,229 --> 02:24:05,169
I looked around the table.

1660
02:24:06,069 --> 02:24:08,090
I didn't see one nod, one hand go up, nothing.

1661
02:24:09,082 --> 02:24:16,187
So when you say we bet for 18 to 20 hours, and this was a great process, I don't know where you're coming from.

1662
02:24:16,727 --> 02:24:17,728
I don't know where you're coming from.

1663
02:24:18,328 --> 02:24:22,331
A great process is having involvement, exchanging of ideas.

1664
02:24:22,931 --> 02:24:24,012
That's a great process.

1665
02:24:24,412 --> 02:24:34,899
Even the school department, after some of the deliberation, came back and added things to the school budget based on recommendations by members of the school committee.

1666
02:24:35,560 --> 02:24:36,881
Did that happen with this body?

1667
02:24:37,641 --> 02:24:40,143
Did anyone come and say, Hey, I know you offered this suggestion.

1668
02:24:40,463 --> 02:24:42,284
Maybe we can't do this, but maybe we could do this.

1669
02:24:43,145 --> 02:24:44,206
Nothing at all.

1670
02:24:45,086 --> 02:24:45,647
Nothing at all.

1671
02:24:45,867 --> 02:24:47,928
And I'm only speaking, maybe it happened to other members.

1672
02:24:48,189 --> 02:24:49,089
It didn't happen with me.

1673
02:24:49,529 --> 02:24:59,316
So I'd like to go through a few of the lowlights that I believe should have been included in this budget items that this council has worked on over the years.

1674
02:24:59,937 --> 02:25:04,200
And we're going to lose progress because of the lack of funding on some of these items.

1675
02:25:04,888 --> 02:25:11,551
And I'm not proud to say that, but it's going to happen and I'm going to lay out in detail and it's going to take some time, Mr. President.

1676
02:25:11,991 --> 02:25:18,634
So, uh, grab your comfy seat and sit back because this is important.

1677
02:25:19,814 --> 02:25:26,477
You know, it's one thing to mention it at a committee, the whole meeting in front of, uh, you know, some administrators.

1678
02:25:26,877 --> 02:25:30,338
And it's another thing to let the general public know what's going on in this community.

1679
02:25:31,839 --> 02:25:32,039
You know,

1680
02:25:32,799 --> 02:25:39,602
For the past two years, this council initiated a line item in the budget.

1681
02:25:40,182 --> 02:25:45,604
We were the ones that initiated a $15,000 line item in the budget for the arts.

1682
02:25:47,145 --> 02:25:48,706
That was monumental in this community.

1683
02:25:48,726 --> 02:25:53,328
It's never been done before to recognize method arts in this community.

1684
02:25:53,908 --> 02:25:55,208
And that was done two years ago.

1685
02:25:56,229 --> 02:25:58,710
And we went to the art community, and we said, you know what?

1686
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:01,051
This is not going to just be a gravy train.

1687
02:26:01,881 --> 02:26:06,903
If you want additional funding in the budget, you're going to have to prove to us that it's worthy of the funding.

1688
02:26:07,143 --> 02:26:08,924
You're going to have to show us community outreach.

1689
02:26:09,204 --> 02:26:12,985
You're going to have to show us what programming was done with this money.

1690
02:26:14,206 --> 02:26:22,349
And sure enough, the next year came about last year, and this council voted to add another $15,000, bringing it up to $30,000.

1691
02:26:23,329 --> 02:26:31,192
Based on the input we received from the Method Arts Council, Mackie, and all the other artists group in this community that are involved,

1692
02:26:31,547 --> 02:26:40,629
and putting so many good programs like the West Bedford Open Studios, Circle the Square, and the list goes on and on.

1693
02:26:40,649 --> 02:26:48,832
You know, this year, Mr. President, I offered to continue the momentum we had, asking for another $15,000.

1694
02:26:51,481 --> 02:26:57,027
Now it wasn't just to throw $15,000 at a group of artists in the community to please them.

1695
02:26:57,628 --> 02:27:12,404
It was because they've shown us over years that they've been able to take this money and use it in outreach, in reaching out to the community, in setting up programs that impact thousands of Method residents, putting a face in this community.

1696
02:27:12,868 --> 02:27:15,009
that was missed for so many years.

1697
02:27:15,690 --> 02:27:23,474
And I want to go through some of the highlights that were presented to me by the arts community after I offered this.

1698
02:27:24,655 --> 02:27:33,160
And I think it's telling, Mr. President, that some of the facts and figures that they presented us, that the money in the budget they like.

1699
02:27:34,110 --> 02:27:40,075
The money in the budget does not fully fund what they're trying to do, does not even come remotely close.

1700
02:27:40,456 --> 02:27:48,523
And without the money in the budget, there is no art program for all intents and purposes, because the state has been cutting the arts, as we all know, year after year.

1701
02:27:49,083 --> 02:27:53,467
So for 2016, the Method Arts Council gave out $45,300 to 62 projects and field trips in this community.

1702
02:27:59,679 --> 02:28:04,564
This represents an increase of $15,000 over 2015.

1703
02:28:05,465 --> 02:28:14,773
Due to greater funding provided by the city of Method, which is this city council, more projects were funded and an average grant amount increased by 35%.

1704
02:28:14,813 --> 02:28:23,542
So we were able to increase the grants that we provide to these different groups in the community, an additional 35% to do what they do.

1705
02:28:25,444 --> 02:28:28,548
We were also able to fund 11 of these proposals at 100%.

1706
02:28:30,405 --> 02:28:44,611
The total amount requested by the community for 2016 was $93,321, which means that we were unable to meet even 50% of the demand despite our increased budget.

1707
02:28:45,351 --> 02:28:56,856
So even with the increases we made the headway over the last two years, according to the numbers from the Method Arts Council, we were only able to meet less than 50% of what was asked for.

1708
02:28:57,596 --> 02:29:00,617
Our available budget fell short of the total request by $48,000.

1709
02:29:01,557 --> 02:29:07,279
An increased effort to attract new applicants and projects started to be seen in 2016.

1710
02:29:07,339 --> 02:29:14,141
The greater visibility is due to the contribution of outreach and the City of Meffitt's investment.

1711
02:29:14,861 --> 02:29:25,444
The Meffitt Arts Council was also selected, as this council knows, as the 2016 Cultural Council of the Year by the state, just the third council ever chosen for this honor.

1712
02:29:26,024 --> 02:29:35,327
The citation specifically pointed to, among other things, our new level of partnership with the City of Meffitt, our regional leadership and public support for the arts.

1713
02:29:36,447 --> 02:29:44,870
Then it also goes on to say, most of the city's allocations to the Meffitt Arts Council has gone to community grant programs.

1714
02:29:45,370 --> 02:29:46,890
Some of the highlights in 2016, many of which we funded.

1715
02:29:50,092 --> 02:29:51,213
with the budget request.

1716
02:29:52,013 --> 02:29:57,077
A second year of highly successful multimedia cultural exchange at the Senior Center.

1717
02:29:57,698 --> 02:30:03,121
This project caught the attention of the Mass Cultural Council, which was asked to nominate for an award.

1718
02:30:03,542 --> 02:30:06,704
Unfortunately, we did not win, but we were nominated for an award.

1719
02:30:07,445 --> 02:30:17,632
An innovative touch-guided quilt and sewing program for the blind and visually impaired, which is being piloted at the Senior Center with the intention to expand it to other communities.

1720
02:30:18,404 --> 02:30:21,646
Stipends for musicians to play at the Methodist Farmer's Market.

1721
02:30:22,587 --> 02:30:24,589
Artists shouldn't work for free, and they're right.

1722
02:30:24,629 --> 02:30:30,073
If you go down to the Farmer's Market, there's music playing all the time, and it's an upbeat environment.

1723
02:30:31,494 --> 02:30:41,221
Terrific new program at Chevalier Theater, including the onstage series that brings in new kids, kinds of brands, and new audiences to the venue.

1724
02:30:41,621 --> 02:30:46,885
A collaboration between the Monkey House Dance Company and the Boys and Girls Club to introduce choreography,

1725
02:30:47,268 --> 02:30:48,469
and movement to young kids.

1726
02:30:49,149 --> 02:30:54,793
The Meffitt Calling Program, pairing prominent songwriters with aspiring musicians from Meffitt High School.

1727
02:30:55,554 --> 02:31:04,640
We are artistically going to paint our crosswalks, which we'll use art to design and increase pedestrian safety and beautification on our streets.

1728
02:31:05,141 --> 02:31:11,465
These are the things that were done in 2016 by the mayor funding, and I do say mayor funding, in $162 million budget, with the $30,000 budget that we implemented

1729
02:31:17,370 --> 02:31:18,951
by this council back some two years ago.

1730
02:31:19,431 --> 02:31:21,232
So we were looking to increase it to 45.

1731
02:31:21,653 --> 02:31:24,014
The mayor turned that down, unfortunately.

1732
02:31:26,556 --> 02:31:27,656
Chevalier Auditorium.

1733
02:31:28,437 --> 02:31:33,079
You know, we have the budget for Chevalier Auditorium.

1734
02:31:33,700 --> 02:31:36,902
And yes, there was a building custodian put in the budget for $24,749.

1735
02:31:36,962 --> 02:31:38,503
That brings the total budget up to $91,749.

1736
02:31:46,459 --> 02:31:52,904
There is not any money, I shouldn't say that, there is very little money for building improvements.

1737
02:31:53,224 --> 02:31:55,606
There's building repairs, but building improvements.

1738
02:31:56,107 --> 02:32:04,213
I talked to members of the Chevalier Commission, I talked to members of the Friends of Chevalier, and they were all interested.

1739
02:32:04,760 --> 02:32:16,464
in presenting a marquee on the front of Chevalier, to give it a face, to give it a presence, to let people know that it exists, even people in this community to let it know it exists.

1740
02:32:17,364 --> 02:32:27,628
For $20,000 to $30,000, I don't know if you remember about a year ago, there was a movie, a motion picture that was being filmed in the city, and they put an old marquee up on the Chevalier Theater.

1741
02:32:28,461 --> 02:32:33,523
And I kept the picture of it because, really, it put a face on that building that was never seen before.

1742
02:32:33,783 --> 02:32:38,224
There was neon on the sign and so forth, and it attracted you to the building.

1743
02:32:39,084 --> 02:32:42,926
I asked in the budget this year for a $50,000 appropriation.

1744
02:32:43,226 --> 02:32:46,287
Let's not forget, this is a city-owned building.

1745
02:32:47,587 --> 02:32:50,608
This doesn't belong to Joe Smith, Paul Jones.

1746
02:32:50,908 --> 02:32:56,070
This is a city-owned building that the city has lacked to support over the years.

1747
02:32:57,145 --> 02:33:01,850
They'll be the first to say, every elected official, that's the economic engine in the city.

1748
02:33:02,410 --> 02:33:06,154
I heard it over and over again at the debates from the mayor, from the council.

1749
02:33:06,574 --> 02:33:07,916
That's the economic engine.

1750
02:33:08,316 --> 02:33:12,741
And then when it comes time for the budget, the economic engine is running on air.

1751
02:33:13,361 --> 02:33:13,862
Let me tell you.

1752
02:33:15,590 --> 02:33:23,696
We're not like Lowell that puts money into funding their public auditorium and puts money into bringing in entertainers.

1753
02:33:24,157 --> 02:33:27,279
You realize how expensive it is to bring in a top name entertainer?

1754
02:33:28,420 --> 02:33:32,643
You might be talking 40 or 50 or 60,000 as a retainer.

1755
02:33:34,665 --> 02:33:36,166
Chevalier doesn't have that money.

1756
02:33:37,348 --> 02:33:39,828
We have to be committed to that particular building.

1757
02:33:40,529 --> 02:33:48,030
And yes, there's been improvements made, but we're falling short of the mark when it comes to taking that building to the next level.

1758
02:33:49,290 --> 02:33:55,531
And I'm very disappointed that the mayor refused to add a line item for building improvements in Chevalier.

1759
02:33:55,971 --> 02:33:58,192
That's an 1,800 seat theater.

1760
02:33:58,532 --> 02:34:02,292
It's the sixth largest theater in the Boston metropolitan area.

1761
02:34:03,133 --> 02:34:03,853
Sixth largest.

1762
02:34:04,233 --> 02:34:05,753
We have it right in our community.

1763
02:34:06,511 --> 02:34:09,572
It's all volunteer civic commission that oversees it.

1764
02:34:10,512 --> 02:34:19,454
And the city, in their wisdom, funds it for $91,000, which includes a $24,000 building custodian, which is needed.

1765
02:34:20,954 --> 02:34:22,874
But that's not what's needed, Mr. President.

1766
02:34:23,775 --> 02:34:29,056
If you want to look at another city-owned building that this city neglected, just take a look at Brooks Estates.

1767
02:34:30,776 --> 02:34:32,216
Just take a ride up to Brooks Estates.

1768
02:34:33,757 --> 02:34:35,517
Actually, you're better off walking, because the road

1769
02:34:35,873 --> 02:34:36,834
is not adequate enough.

1770
02:34:36,894 --> 02:34:39,356
It's really not safe toe drive up there.

1771
02:34:40,277 --> 02:34:48,483
But that's another city old building that this community neglected for years, depending on volunteers to raise the money, and it's just not happening.

1772
02:34:52,146 --> 02:34:58,852
My next one, Mr President, we heard from Fire Chief Gilberti, and I'm glad Councilor Penta's here.

1773
02:34:59,357 --> 02:35:08,259
because Council of Penta over the last several years push to have the feedback from the administrators involved in our process.

1774
02:35:08,699 --> 02:35:12,380
For years we met with the administrators and we never received their wish list.

1775
02:35:12,680 --> 02:35:15,580
And it was Council of Penta that said, we need to know your wish list.

1776
02:35:15,881 --> 02:35:27,363
Even if it doesn't get implemented, as a council, we need to know what your priorities are and what you think is necessary for DPW, what's necessary for the schools, what's necessary for police and fire.

1777
02:35:29,867 --> 02:35:31,108
We heard from Chief Gilberti.

1778
02:35:31,708 --> 02:35:36,231
He's concerned about the internal fire alarms within our fire stations.

1779
02:35:37,812 --> 02:35:42,194
Now these aren't the fire alarms that communicate back and forth, although those are outdated.

1780
02:35:42,894 --> 02:35:49,518
These are the internal alarms like you or I would have in our home, a smoke detector, a hard wire detector.

1781
02:35:50,419 --> 02:35:54,401
Many of them are 30 and 40 years old, according to Chief Gilberti.

1782
02:35:56,102 --> 02:35:57,483
God forbid something were to happen

1783
02:35:58,372 --> 02:35:59,353
in one of these buildings.

1784
02:36:00,193 --> 02:36:06,177
And we knew that our fire station alarms are inadequate within each station.

1785
02:36:07,097 --> 02:36:12,601
That's a major concern that should be addressed, and it's not addressed in this particular budget.

1786
02:36:14,142 --> 02:36:15,843
You know, we heard from Police Chief Sacco.

1787
02:36:16,823 --> 02:36:22,107
He requested six unmarked cars and six marked cars in the budget.

1788
02:36:24,688 --> 02:36:25,749
Denied by the mayor.

1789
02:36:26,902 --> 02:36:31,607
Now that may be part of some capital improvement plan that we have yet to see.

1790
02:36:32,088 --> 02:36:34,230
We have yet to hear when it's going to come out.

1791
02:36:34,450 --> 02:36:35,311
We don't know what's in it.

1792
02:36:35,651 --> 02:36:36,592
That may be part of it.

1793
02:36:38,054 --> 02:36:38,875
But in my opinion,

1794
02:36:39,570 --> 02:36:47,655
As we've been stating for years, this council, there should be at least two to three cars in each year's budget, at a minimum.

1795
02:36:48,035 --> 02:36:52,938
These cars are running 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and they have multiple drivers.

1796
02:36:53,219 --> 02:36:54,099
Think about your car.

1797
02:36:54,820 --> 02:36:58,002
You get out of it after work, it sits in the driveway for 12 hours.

1798
02:36:58,842 --> 02:37:06,447
Someone doesn't get in it and drive it for another 12 hours and drive it a different way than you're driving, which is harmful to a car.

1799
02:37:07,604 --> 02:37:11,787
These cars that we have right now are experiencing transmission problems.

1800
02:37:13,308 --> 02:37:16,730
These cars we have right now are inadequate in the community.

1801
02:37:16,750 --> 02:37:19,692
They spend much of their time being serviced.

1802
02:37:21,933 --> 02:37:27,517
You know, you can't provide public, public safety is probably the most important issue that we provide for.

1803
02:37:28,157 --> 02:37:31,720
You can't provide public safety with inadequate equipment.

1804
02:37:32,940 --> 02:37:35,042
We already know the police department should be condemned.

1805
02:37:36,445 --> 02:37:37,947
We determined that years ago.

1806
02:37:38,667 --> 02:37:45,513
And now we have vehicles that the mayor's allowing our brave men and women drive around in that are inadequate.

1807
02:37:46,533 --> 02:37:47,234
They really are.

1808
02:37:48,355 --> 02:37:49,616
And it's not part of the budget.

1809
02:37:51,137 --> 02:37:52,518
We also heard from the chief.

1810
02:37:53,319 --> 02:38:02,346
He said, I'd like to have some civilians, roughly four civilians, to do some crime analysis, to do some IT work in the department.

1811
02:38:03,970 --> 02:38:14,715
That could go a long way to advising people what's going on in this community, having some crime analysis available, crime analysis on the website.

1812
02:38:14,735 --> 02:38:23,379
You know, I attended the West Method, as well as Councilor Caviello, the West Method Crime Watch that they had several weeks back.

1813
02:38:24,239 --> 02:38:25,940
And over and over again, we heard

1814
02:38:26,538 --> 02:38:29,921
We would like a place where we can go and see crime statistics.

1815
02:38:30,221 --> 02:38:34,685
We'd like to know what's not only happening in our neighborhood, but happening in other sections of the community.

1816
02:38:35,085 --> 02:38:37,487
That currently doesn't exist in this community.

1817
02:38:38,088 --> 02:38:43,352
The chief asked for that, which to me is a very reasonable request, and that was denied.

1818
02:38:43,712 --> 02:38:47,435
The vehicles and the civilian positions was denied in the budget.

1819
02:38:48,756 --> 02:38:51,959
You know, a small request that was something that I asked for.

1820
02:38:51,979 --> 02:38:55,562
You know, I was approached by one of the poll workers.

1821
02:38:56,213 --> 02:38:57,273
months and months back.

1822
02:38:57,934 --> 02:39:02,595
And she said, you realize when we're at a poll, we could be there from 12 to 14 hours.

1823
02:39:04,015 --> 02:39:08,497
She said, nothing against the police, but they're there and they get a box lunch.

1824
02:39:10,177 --> 02:39:17,259
The workers that are checking people in, checking people out, working their 12 to 14 hours, get nothing, absolutely nothing.

1825
02:39:17,599 --> 02:39:22,921
In a busy state and federal election, many of them can't even leave in a busy election.

1826
02:39:24,585 --> 02:39:27,167
So we're asking them to sit in there for 12 to 14 hours.

1827
02:39:27,567 --> 02:39:33,751
I put in a request to add $3,000 to the budget.

1828
02:39:33,771 --> 02:39:38,915
A line item 5780 for $3,000 to pay for some lunches, box lunches.

1829
02:39:39,335 --> 02:39:43,038
And we could do it, the city clerk could do it any way he like.

1830
02:39:43,078 --> 02:39:48,842
He could provide pizza, box lunches, he can give people a stipend or whatever it might be to get something to eat.

1831
02:39:49,302 --> 02:39:51,704
Whatever it could be, could be worked out administratively.

1832
02:39:52,567 --> 02:39:53,988
That was denied by the mayor.

1833
02:39:54,268 --> 02:39:57,429
Sorry, insufficient funds for the poll workers.

1834
02:39:59,470 --> 02:40:04,452
You know, the school budget, and I'm glad to see the superintendent's still here.

1835
02:40:06,013 --> 02:40:08,734
Several weeks back, I got a unanimous vote from this council.

1836
02:40:09,194 --> 02:40:15,356
I brought up the issue that right now the school department and the city side do not pay for water and sewer.

1837
02:40:16,737 --> 02:40:18,878
In my opinion, water and sewer is a utility.

1838
02:40:19,898 --> 02:40:21,539
It's like gas, it's like electric,

1839
02:40:22,472 --> 02:40:23,853
It's an operating expense.

1840
02:40:24,454 --> 02:40:31,800
You can't run a high school in the boilers, in the bathrooms, and everything else, the pool, associated with the high school, without water and sewer.

1841
02:40:32,260 --> 02:40:33,661
It's an operating expense.

1842
02:40:34,322 --> 02:40:38,245
Some years back, the powers to be took it out of the budget.

1843
02:40:38,725 --> 02:40:39,606
And they said, you know what?

1844
02:40:40,206 --> 02:40:42,088
We're not going to include it in our budget anymore.

1845
02:40:42,908 --> 02:40:45,611
We're going to put it under unaccounted for water.

1846
02:40:46,445 --> 02:40:55,829
And what that is, every rate payer who already pays their bill is going to pay a little additional more to pay for what we call unaccounted for water.

1847
02:40:56,449 --> 02:41:02,071
The only problem with that is the water on the school side and on the city side is accounted for.

1848
02:41:02,831 --> 02:41:03,372
It's meted.

1849
02:41:04,312 --> 02:41:09,034
It's about $400,000 combined from the city and the school side.

1850
02:41:10,152 --> 02:41:14,513
And in my opinion, that should be a budget line item under the operating expenses.

1851
02:41:15,013 --> 02:41:18,054
And it shouldn't fall on the backs of the rate payers.

1852
02:41:18,834 --> 02:41:21,335
It should not fall on the backs of the rate payers.

1853
02:41:21,615 --> 02:41:28,316
That's a way of taking money out of the budget, putting in other things in the budget that you feel are more of a priority.

1854
02:41:29,136 --> 02:41:33,438
It might be a new PR person at 90-something thousand dollars.

1855
02:41:33,878 --> 02:41:35,218
It might be whatever it might be.

1856
02:41:36,358 --> 02:41:38,280
That's a way of shifting money around.

1857
02:41:38,860 --> 02:41:43,405
And in my opinion, if we want a true budget, that should be within this.

1858
02:41:43,685 --> 02:41:49,590
And that was a unanimous vote in this council, and it went to the mayor, and it did not find its way in this budget.

1859
02:41:50,011 --> 02:41:59,700
Another thing that the mayor failed to act upon in this budget, or even come back and give a reasonable response why it couldn't be done.

1860
02:42:05,845 --> 02:42:09,647
On the school budget again, we heard about security.

1861
02:42:10,247 --> 02:42:12,188
Security went up 37%.

1862
02:42:12,809 --> 02:42:15,630
People at home are saying, wow, we are secure.

1863
02:42:16,571 --> 02:42:18,952
Security in the school department went up 37%.

1864
02:42:20,893 --> 02:42:29,818
So I asked the superintendent of schools, I said, Mr. Superintendent, you hired building monitors in addition to the one security guard we have.

1865
02:42:31,323 --> 02:42:36,626
I said, what happens at 3.30 when the school lets out?

1866
02:42:37,406 --> 02:42:41,228
Is there any building monitors or security guards present at 3.30?

1867
02:42:43,009 --> 02:42:44,530
He said, there is not a one.

1868
02:42:45,350 --> 02:42:53,254
However, we do rely on custodians, administrators that still may be around the building to keep an eye out.

1869
02:42:55,295 --> 02:42:59,437
So here we have a building that's open, unsecure, in my opinion,

1870
02:43:00,467 --> 02:43:03,008
and open to the public after school lets out.

1871
02:43:03,948 --> 02:43:08,670
That would be like saying any state building, go up to the state house and say, oh, they're out of session now.

1872
02:43:09,070 --> 02:43:10,050
All security leave.

1873
02:43:10,911 --> 02:43:11,871
There's no reps up here.

1874
02:43:12,011 --> 02:43:12,871
Everyone can leave now.

1875
02:43:14,192 --> 02:43:14,912
That's unheard of.

1876
02:43:15,872 --> 02:43:17,353
That building should be secured.

1877
02:43:17,593 --> 02:43:23,255
There should only be a few entrances that people can get in, and those entrances should be manned.

1878
02:43:24,763 --> 02:43:30,227
And then when the building's locked down, there should still be a security person walking around a building that size.

1879
02:43:32,468 --> 02:43:35,190
You know, a high school, a school, those are soft targets.

1880
02:43:36,331 --> 02:43:38,832
And unfortunately in this city, they're even softer.

1881
02:43:40,053 --> 02:43:44,856
You know, if we hired new building monitors, why put them on all the same time?

1882
02:43:46,617 --> 02:43:48,098
Okay, come in at eight, leave at three.

1883
02:43:49,359 --> 02:43:50,740
Why not stagger the times?

1884
02:43:52,461 --> 02:43:53,742
It makes no sense.

1885
02:43:54,554 --> 02:43:55,495
It makes no sense.

1886
02:43:58,878 --> 02:44:11,731
You know, if something were to happen in our schools and we were to sit back and say, you know what, we were all aware that these buildings are not secured after hours, but they're open, but they're not secured.

1887
02:44:13,312 --> 02:44:18,077
We would feel awful as a council and I'm sure the school committee would feel the same way.

1888
02:44:19,911 --> 02:44:28,336
But just because an incident went by, we had the bomb scares and so forth, and now it's out of sight, out of mind, we can't say, you know what, oh, we're fine, we're fine.

1889
02:44:28,817 --> 02:44:30,118
The threat is still there.

1890
02:44:31,538 --> 02:44:32,799
However, the security's not.

1891
02:44:33,720 --> 02:44:41,505
And I'm not happy with the answers I received from the superintendent of schools regarding the lack of security and the lack of secured buildings, in my opinion.

1892
02:44:41,865 --> 02:44:47,909
I believe our buildings are overused currently right now, and I believe that should be looked at in addition.

1893
02:44:52,978 --> 02:45:02,825
For the past three years, this council asked, when we get a budget, that if we could have an expenditure line item in the current fiscal year.

1894
02:45:03,465 --> 02:45:12,591
So they show FY15, they show FY16, then you would have either an actual, like Councilor Felkel mentioned, or an expenditure to date.

1895
02:45:13,312 --> 02:45:14,552
And then the budget, FY17.

1896
02:45:15,613 --> 02:45:16,954
We've asked for three years.

1897
02:45:17,374 --> 02:45:21,217
We were told by the former budget director, Louise Miller, that's doable.

1898
02:45:21,528 --> 02:45:23,829
and it would have been done in this budget process.

1899
02:45:24,870 --> 02:45:26,110
I asked right at the beginning.

1900
02:45:26,871 --> 02:45:29,892
I wasn't trying to throw any, you know, hold anything off.

1901
02:45:30,172 --> 02:45:32,913
I asked right at the beginning if that could be included.

1902
02:45:33,554 --> 02:45:42,758
It's important to know when an account, coming from someone that does finance, when an account has a surplus or a deficit when you're setting a new budget.

1903
02:45:43,578 --> 02:45:43,799
That's 101.

1904
02:45:45,319 --> 02:45:46,200
It's important to know.

1905
02:45:47,113 --> 02:45:54,378
and to sit back and not have that information, and then at the end of the year, receive a million dollars for transfers.

1906
02:45:54,398 --> 02:45:58,361
243,000 out of fire salaries.

1907
02:45:59,602 --> 02:46:00,342
Guess what that was?

1908
02:46:01,523 --> 02:46:02,704
We didn't hire firefighters.

1909
02:46:03,784 --> 02:46:05,085
But that money will be transferred.

1910
02:46:06,326 --> 02:46:07,827
We told you we were gonna hire firefighters.

1911
02:46:08,327 --> 02:46:09,488
It sounded good last year.

1912
02:46:10,609 --> 02:46:11,890
We all put it as a highlight.

1913
02:46:12,250 --> 02:46:14,752
I'm sure the administration said, look at this highlight.

1914
02:46:16,615 --> 02:46:17,216
But guess what?

1915
02:46:17,536 --> 02:46:18,356
It wasn't funded.

1916
02:46:18,637 --> 02:46:26,603
That money will be used for another appropriation, maybe to fund one of the mayor's other priorities that was underfunded.

1917
02:46:26,944 --> 02:46:27,344
Who knows?

1918
02:46:28,085 --> 02:46:31,948
But these are the games that go on year after year after year.

1919
02:46:32,428 --> 02:46:36,151
And without a proper accounting in the budget, it's going to continue.

1920
02:46:36,932 --> 02:46:39,174
Ann Baker did provide a list here.

1921
02:46:40,375 --> 02:46:44,118
And Ann, if I had two years of time, I could probably match this up.

1922
02:46:44,870 --> 02:46:47,791
with the budget line items, and I probably could do it.

1923
02:46:47,811 --> 02:46:50,212
It would take me some time, but I probably could do it.

1924
02:46:50,652 --> 02:47:00,274
However, the fiscal year ends Friday, and another broken promise by this administration.

1925
02:47:01,935 --> 02:47:12,898
You know, I read an article, I don't know, a couple of months ago in the transcript, the mayor's first 100 days, and it said, priority one, enhancing communication.

1926
02:47:15,495 --> 02:47:20,496
So I guess not sending a representative to our budget meetings is enhancing communication.

1927
02:47:21,576 --> 02:47:27,057
I guess not getting responses that this council has requested is enhancing communication.

1928
02:47:28,417 --> 02:47:45,140
I guess sending the finance person tonight, who by the way is going to be retiring in four weeks and congratulations, I wish you well in, you've done a lot of good for this community, as the budget person, I think does a disservice to not only this council, but to the community.

1929
02:47:47,760 --> 02:47:52,023
And the mayor should have presented the budget, $162 million.

1930
02:47:52,264 --> 02:47:53,405
This is her first budget.

1931
02:47:53,985 --> 02:48:00,110
And as Councilwoman Lungo said, she spent three minutes with this council in the 20 hours we spent going over budget.

1932
02:48:00,911 --> 02:48:02,632
Shame on Mayor Burke.

1933
02:48:03,273 --> 02:48:03,833
Shame on her.

1934
02:48:06,115 --> 02:48:10,398
You know, Mr. President, there are a lot of positive things in this budget.

1935
02:48:13,161 --> 02:48:15,883
But as was stated by Dr. Streller and some of the other speakers,

1936
02:48:16,549 --> 02:48:21,010
We can't go through the same thing over and over again and expect a different outcome.

1937
02:48:21,770 --> 02:48:23,250
It's the definition of insanity.

1938
02:48:26,231 --> 02:48:37,033
And guess what, Mr. President, for those of us that ask questions, that paid attention, that care about the taxpayers' money in this community, it's important to us.

1939
02:48:39,874 --> 02:48:43,895
And I, for one, am not going to put my stamp of approval on this budget.

1940
02:48:46,070 --> 02:48:55,417
If the mayor had the smallest inkling of communication, she would have contacted this council.

1941
02:48:55,717 --> 02:49:00,221
She would have sat down with the council and said, council, you know what, this is a city budget.

1942
02:49:00,481 --> 02:49:02,243
I know it's my budget, I present it.

1943
02:49:02,683 --> 02:49:04,024
What would you like in the budget?

1944
02:49:04,444 --> 02:49:05,945
What do you think is necessary?

1945
02:49:06,366 --> 02:49:10,709
Geez, you've been around for five years, you've been around 14 years, you've been around three years.

1946
02:49:11,310 --> 02:49:12,030
What would you like?

1947
02:49:12,350 --> 02:49:14,232
What do you think is needed in the budget?

1948
02:49:15,438 --> 02:49:16,559
never happened.

1949
02:49:17,380 --> 02:49:18,481
Shame on this mayor.

1950
02:49:19,061 --> 02:49:19,982
Shame on this mayor.

1951
02:49:21,463 --> 02:49:23,545
You know, and my colleagues are welcome to do what they want.

1952
02:49:24,125 --> 02:49:44,042
I know some of my colleagues are new to the budget process, but to go through the same budget process year after year and have no impact at all as a council, and that's my opinion, no impact at all, is a disservice to every taxpayer in this community that expects us to do our job.

1953
02:49:45,427 --> 02:49:48,668
We're a legislative body, and we set the city budget.

1954
02:49:49,829 --> 02:49:51,489
You can count on one hand our function.

1955
02:49:53,490 --> 02:49:54,451
Those are the two top.

1956
02:49:56,351 --> 02:50:02,514
And to let the budget go by, as submitted by the mayor, fine, if that's your intent, fine.

1957
02:50:03,054 --> 02:50:05,655
I, as one member of the council, refuse to do so.

1958
02:50:06,375 --> 02:50:10,837
I'd rather bring the mayor to the table and say, Madam Mayor, why can't we?

1959
02:50:11,297 --> 02:50:12,338
Why can't we do this?

1960
02:50:12,987 --> 02:50:17,170
And if it's the levy limit problem that the mayor has, we reach the levy limit.

1961
02:50:19,131 --> 02:50:22,393
I think that's the first I ever heard, reach the levy limit.

1962
02:50:22,974 --> 02:50:24,775
Gee, McGlynn was here 30 years, I never heard that.

1963
02:50:25,455 --> 02:50:28,737
But under this new mayor, response was we reached the levy limit.

1964
02:50:29,418 --> 02:50:39,865
And my suggestion back to the mayor is, then maybe we should look at the stipends, the confidentiality stipends you give your staff people.

1965
02:50:41,390 --> 02:50:47,837
How many people are hired when you get a job and you walk into the job and they say, okay, here's what you have to do.

1966
02:50:48,658 --> 02:50:51,881
And then they say, on top of that, this is confidential information.

1967
02:50:52,923 --> 02:50:57,367
We're going to pay you over and above your salary because you're dealing with confidential information.

1968
02:50:58,029 --> 02:50:58,810
Doesn't happen.

1969
02:50:59,631 --> 02:51:01,312
Doesn't happen in the private sector.

1970
02:51:01,913 --> 02:51:02,954
That's party or job.

1971
02:51:03,454 --> 02:51:20,772
So if there are people in the mayor's office that are handling confidential information, and there may be, and there's people in the assessor's office, and the people in the treasurer collector's office, and there's people in every department that are handling confidential information that aren't getting these stipends, they happen to be to just a few in the mayor's office.

1972
02:51:21,708 --> 02:51:34,670
Maybe we could cut that portion out of the budget, and maybe we can add something for the arts, or maybe we can add something that we think would be a bigger bang for our buck, rather than padding someone's salary.

1973
02:51:34,690 --> 02:51:35,810
Because that's all it is.

1974
02:51:36,270 --> 02:51:37,071
Don't fool yourself.

1975
02:51:37,591 --> 02:51:38,431
That's all it is.

1976
02:51:38,771 --> 02:51:40,771
It's a padding of someone's salary.

1977
02:51:42,812 --> 02:51:47,532
So, Mr. President, with that being said, I will not support the budget here tonight.

1978
02:51:48,633 --> 02:51:50,913
I refuse to support it on the basis that

1979
02:51:51,250 --> 02:51:55,513
The mayor refused to send anyone that can answer questions to our budget meeting.

1980
02:51:56,294 --> 02:52:00,818
She made this budget, in my opinion, the worst budget process I've ever been through.

1981
02:52:01,678 --> 02:52:04,140
She didn't look for any input from this council.

1982
02:52:04,721 --> 02:52:06,682
She didn't look for any input from the community.

1983
02:52:07,123 --> 02:52:14,909
She failed to put the budget or proposed budget on the city websites for open transparency and open government.

1984
02:52:16,579 --> 02:52:17,799
Who cares after the fact?

1985
02:52:18,419 --> 02:52:23,940
Mr. President, if you ran your funeral home like the mayor's run in this city, you'd be out of business right now.

1986
02:52:25,721 --> 02:52:28,501
You shouldn't settle for any less because it's the city budget.

1987
02:52:29,221 --> 02:52:32,202
You should hold it to the same standard, Mr. President, as you do for your funeral home.

1988
02:52:32,262 --> 02:52:33,222
Over 30 minutes, consulate.

1989
02:52:33,242 --> 02:52:34,202
Thank you very much.

1990
02:52:34,222 --> 02:52:35,122
I'm not done yet, Mr. President.

1991
02:52:35,182 --> 02:52:35,682
You are.

1992
02:52:35,702 --> 02:52:37,563
The chair awaits a motion.

1993
02:52:38,343 --> 02:52:39,703
Mr. President, I am not done yet.

1994
02:52:39,723 --> 02:52:41,343
You didn't tell me what time I had.

1995
02:52:41,363 --> 02:52:42,064
I am not done yet.

1996
02:52:43,484 --> 02:52:44,204
I still have comments.

1997
02:52:49,373 --> 02:52:50,494
Is there a motion on the floor?

1998
02:52:50,534 --> 02:52:56,838
I'd like to hear from the superintendent of school, Mr. President, who is here regarding the security.

1999
02:52:56,858 --> 02:53:09,147
I'd like to hear his comments regarding why buildings aren't secure after school lights up.

2000
02:53:09,167 --> 02:53:16,753
Mr. President, members of the council, I understand that Councilor Marks has legitimate concerns about security.

2001
02:53:17,504 --> 02:53:25,466
and the like, but I want to offer a few thoughts, and hopefully, you know, maybe it'll help us understand each other, okay?

2002
02:53:26,387 --> 02:53:27,807
Well, let's see what happens.

2003
02:53:28,527 --> 02:53:29,208
Let's see what happens.

2004
02:53:30,308 --> 02:53:34,169
You know, during the day, we have intensive security.

2005
02:53:34,329 --> 02:53:37,530
It's not perfect, but it's a lot better than most school systems.

2006
02:53:38,651 --> 02:53:46,473
We have, and we, and you know, some of the events that happened this year obviously ramped up some of the things that we did, because people felt a need to do that.

2007
02:53:46,962 --> 02:53:56,209
when the majority of youngsters are there in the school, and they're in concentrated areas, and they need that kind of coverage.

2008
02:53:57,190 --> 02:53:59,332
So we have a lot going on.

2009
02:53:59,372 --> 02:54:00,053
We have cameras.

2010
02:54:00,093 --> 02:54:00,813
We have monitors.

2011
02:54:00,833 --> 02:54:01,434
We have guards.

2012
02:54:01,994 --> 02:54:03,635
We have resource officers.

2013
02:54:03,675 --> 02:54:05,117
We have door locks in the systems.

2014
02:54:05,617 --> 02:54:08,039
You know, we have ID systems now.

2015
02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:16,626
We meet with CBJ every week to determine what's happening in the streets, so when it comes in Monday morning, we know what's going on, what happened over the weekend,

2016
02:54:17,671 --> 02:54:20,373
We have constant contact with the police.

2017
02:54:20,393 --> 02:54:23,575
We have constant contact with the DA's office, the courts.

2018
02:54:24,255 --> 02:54:27,537
There's a lot going on that people don't see.

2019
02:54:28,258 --> 02:54:32,521
We belong to NMLEC, which is a regional group that brings things in.

2020
02:54:33,461 --> 02:54:40,526
But council raises the issue of what happens around 3.30 when things are over for the main part of the day.

2021
02:54:42,810 --> 02:54:47,773
Maybe, just maybe, it would be nice to have all kinds of people there, but you've got to ask a couple questions.

2022
02:54:48,693 --> 02:54:50,434
How functionally effective would it be?

2023
02:54:51,314 --> 02:54:54,256
Not just cosmetic, how functionally effective would it be?

2024
02:54:54,936 --> 02:54:59,379
I'm standing here right now, and there are probably a few people in this room who don't like me.

2025
02:54:59,439 --> 02:55:03,721
I don't know if that's true, but I have the feeling that there's some people who don't really like me.

2026
02:55:04,161 --> 02:55:05,282
My back is to the wall.

2027
02:55:05,682 --> 02:55:07,923
There's no police officer guarding this council.

2028
02:55:08,701 --> 02:55:11,623
There's no police officer at churches and synagogues.

2029
02:55:11,963 --> 02:55:16,706
There's no police officer at the restaurants we go to, in the parks where the Little Leagues play.

2030
02:55:19,087 --> 02:55:20,608
Point of information, Mr. President.

2031
02:55:20,648 --> 02:55:21,268
Well, I don't know.

2032
02:55:21,328 --> 02:55:22,429
I'm trying to give a point of information.

2033
02:55:22,449 --> 02:55:23,450
You're trying to give an answer.

2034
02:55:23,470 --> 02:55:25,591
You're great at circumlocution, Mr. Superintendent.

2035
02:55:25,631 --> 02:55:27,032
No, I'm trying to give you an answer.

2036
02:55:27,072 --> 02:55:27,872
I'm trying to point out to you.

2037
02:55:27,912 --> 02:55:31,654
First of all, I didn't ask for a point of information, please.

2038
02:55:31,855 --> 02:55:32,915
If you'll let me speak, I will.

2039
02:55:33,896 --> 02:55:35,237
I didn't ask for a police officer.

2040
02:55:35,377 --> 02:55:37,118
So that is your first error.

2041
02:55:38,052 --> 02:55:47,335
I asked specifically about after hours, Mr. Superintendent, and you have no security and you have no secure building after hours.

2042
02:55:47,375 --> 02:55:54,158
If you can address that, rather than going into these things about having police officers at every door, that is not what we stated.

2043
02:55:54,958 --> 02:55:56,159
I'm trying to.

2044
02:55:56,639 --> 02:56:05,342
Churches are one thing, Mr. President, but a school that houses thousands of our students deserves the right for security and the right to have a secured building.

2045
02:56:05,742 --> 02:56:07,763
Not in the afternoon, not thousands in the building.

2046
02:56:08,438 --> 02:56:11,740
You know, the parks where the kids play their sports.

2047
02:56:12,240 --> 02:56:14,301
I don't see all kinds of people there.

2048
02:56:15,001 --> 02:56:21,244
Obviously, it would be nice to have all kinds of people around who are doing that officially.

2049
02:56:22,425 --> 02:56:25,086
But you talk about all the things that we want in these budgets.

2050
02:56:25,146 --> 02:56:29,308
You talk about all the things that we would like to do and all the repairs we'd like to make.

2051
02:56:30,208 --> 02:56:35,931
And I personally think that putting people in these roles is not giving us functional value.

2052
02:56:36,391 --> 02:56:38,032
I think we can get the same return

2053
02:56:38,617 --> 02:56:46,242
from people who are crime watchers, if you will, people who can pick up their phone or use their cell and call 911 if necessary.

2054
02:56:46,602 --> 02:56:49,244
I don't think you need that kind of coverage.

2055
02:56:49,865 --> 02:56:51,646
So we've talked about it.

2056
02:56:52,306 --> 02:56:53,167
I'm listening to you.

2057
02:56:53,367 --> 02:56:54,008
I hear you.

2058
02:56:54,408 --> 02:57:00,112
Maybe there's something we can think about, but I don't think it's the kind of thing that we could do

2059
02:57:01,331 --> 02:57:03,913
with fidelity around the schools in the afternoons.

2060
02:57:04,293 --> 02:57:11,479
And I don't think that it's different than what we expect from our little leagues, from our youth programs, soccer programs.

2061
02:57:11,659 --> 02:57:12,500
They're all over the city.

2062
02:57:13,781 --> 02:57:16,163
Random acts of violence happen anywhere.

2063
02:57:17,624 --> 02:57:27,672
So to think that the schools are more likely to have them in the afternoon than the parks where the kids play, or the churches where people go to, or the restaurants where people eat.

2064
02:57:29,192 --> 02:57:30,192
I don't think that's real.

2065
02:57:30,912 --> 02:57:32,133
And so, it's an exchange.

2066
02:57:32,733 --> 02:57:33,953
But, you know, I'll think about it.

2067
02:57:34,013 --> 02:57:35,433
Maybe there's some things we can do.

2068
02:57:35,854 --> 02:57:42,115
But I don't think it's a just refusal to consider the issue.

2069
02:57:42,695 --> 02:57:44,596
I think it's well thought through at this point in time.

2070
02:57:44,616 --> 02:57:45,996
But maybe you don't agree with me.

2071
02:57:46,316 --> 02:57:48,176
That's what I think is really the issue.

2072
02:57:48,216 --> 02:57:49,517
We just don't agree on the subject.

2073
02:57:50,817 --> 02:57:51,077
Mr. President.

2074
02:57:53,278 --> 02:57:54,858
Councillor Marks.

2075
02:57:55,878 --> 02:57:58,719
You know, I realize within a budget you have to make decisions.

2076
02:57:59,577 --> 02:58:04,240
But security is a decision that I'm not willing to let go.

2077
02:58:05,541 --> 02:58:09,123
Security is just as important as the teacher in the classroom.

2078
02:58:12,405 --> 02:58:27,515
And in my opinion, Mr. President, to say during the day, when the students are in there, that you have to check in, you have to show an ID, you have to sign in, you have to — and that process has been tightened up — you're right — recently, Mr. Superintendent.

2079
02:58:28,318 --> 02:58:36,812
But then at 3, 330, I can walk in there with six duffel bags and not be questioned by anyone.

2080
02:58:37,413 --> 02:58:41,120
And I can have access to anywhere in that large campus, as you know.

2081
02:58:42,854 --> 02:58:44,255
That's the problem I have.

2082
02:58:44,655 --> 02:58:54,441
Why would you take all the security that you just put on and put them on in the same time and leave the rest of the times open?

2083
02:58:54,881 --> 02:58:57,043
Leave access to the building open.

2084
02:58:57,503 --> 02:59:01,385
I don't buy the fact that we don't have security in our parks.

2085
02:59:01,806 --> 02:59:02,546
I don't buy that.

2086
02:59:02,866 --> 02:59:05,408
We have police on the streets, Mr. Superintendent.

2087
02:59:06,735 --> 02:59:10,999
Our high school, as you know, when's the last time you had a bomb scare at one of our parks?

2088
02:59:11,900 --> 02:59:14,663
But we've had several at Meffitt High School recently.

2089
02:59:15,103 --> 02:59:15,744
Yes, we have.

2090
02:59:16,004 --> 02:59:18,146
We've had several at Meffitt High School recently.

2091
02:59:18,586 --> 02:59:22,871
And you relied on custodians to go around and look for devices.

2092
02:59:24,451 --> 02:59:27,112
I don't know how that happens, but we relied on custodians.

2093
02:59:27,132 --> 02:59:32,393
So this other pair of eyes you're talking about that are around the building, I don't see it.

2094
02:59:32,693 --> 02:59:34,113
And I think that's ineffective.

2095
02:59:34,553 --> 02:59:46,676
And I think even bringing that up, as Amir mentioned, that you're relying on that as a means of security, shows that you're really not in touch with what security should be and having a secured building.

2096
02:59:47,317 --> 02:59:48,577
So I'm standing here.

2097
02:59:49,648 --> 02:59:51,209
Is anyone protecting you right now?

2098
02:59:51,469 --> 02:59:52,370
Is anyone protecting me?

2099
02:59:52,410 --> 02:59:55,432
Is anyone protecting the citizens of this community right now standing here?

2100
02:59:55,992 --> 02:59:57,534
Anyone could walk in and say anything.

2101
02:59:58,014 --> 02:59:59,415
Anyone could walk in and do something.

2102
03:00:00,476 --> 03:00:04,198
You know, we recognize we live in a society which has some violence to it.

2103
03:00:04,458 --> 03:00:09,382
We recognize we live in a society where there's a lot of random acts of terror and activity.

2104
03:00:10,294 --> 03:00:11,715
But you can't cover everything.

2105
03:00:12,115 --> 03:00:13,856
You can't cover everything realistically.

2106
03:00:13,896 --> 03:00:18,619
And putting a couple of people in the place is not going to be a functional value to us.

2107
03:00:18,659 --> 03:00:20,039
We can get the same return.

2108
03:00:20,800 --> 03:00:21,740
Let me finish the point.

2109
03:00:21,820 --> 03:00:27,263
We can get the same return from people who are asked to look.

2110
03:00:27,303 --> 03:00:27,924
I'll let him finish.

2111
03:00:27,964 --> 03:00:31,806
But, you know, he keeps on saying, he throws out these, we can't cover everything.

2112
03:00:32,126 --> 03:00:33,547
Who asked him to cover everything?

2113
03:00:34,107 --> 03:00:34,787
Thank you, Counselor.

2114
03:00:35,047 --> 03:00:37,529
You know, no one's asking you to cover everything, Mr. Superintendent.

2115
03:00:38,009 --> 03:00:39,570
So, you know, come on now.

2116
03:00:40,132 --> 03:00:41,676
No one's asking you to cover everything.

2117
03:00:41,876 --> 03:00:46,748
We disagree on the functional value of that type of person in the situation.

2118
03:00:47,180 --> 03:00:50,443
But if you want to continue the discussion, maybe the school committee can take it up.

2119
03:00:50,903 --> 03:00:53,225
We can have a discussion, but it's going to require some money.

2120
03:00:53,846 --> 03:01:02,393
It's going to require, what do you call it, an understanding of what they do and how they do it, and whether or not it's really going to give us value or whether or not it's cosmetic.

2121
03:01:03,153 --> 03:01:04,855
So I'm just raising that for you.

2122
03:01:04,895 --> 03:01:09,559
I don't think that in the best of all worlds, we wouldn't have everything we wanted.

2123
03:01:09,599 --> 03:01:10,940
You've raised several things that we want.

2124
03:01:11,500 --> 03:01:13,342
I want a lot of things that I couldn't put in this budget.

2125
03:01:13,782 --> 03:01:15,684
There are people that ask me for things that I couldn't give them.

2126
03:01:16,585 --> 03:01:19,727
okay, in this budget, or any budget.

2127
03:01:20,407 --> 03:01:24,889
I've been doing it for a few years, and I recognize that there are times when you just can't do something.

2128
03:01:25,349 --> 03:01:29,331
I don't think that we are neglectful in this situation.

2129
03:01:29,371 --> 03:01:33,053
I do believe that when we cover the school day, we're doing what we need to do.

2130
03:01:34,213 --> 03:01:35,814
But, okay, look, it's a discussion.

2131
03:01:36,354 --> 03:01:42,377
And I appreciate the fact you care, but I also hope you appreciate the fact that we've thought about it.

2132
03:01:42,837 --> 03:01:44,418
I haven't just dismissed it out of hand.

2133
03:01:44,458 --> 03:01:47,220
I've thought about it, but I don't think it gives us functional value.

2134
03:01:49,021 --> 03:01:49,281
Okay?

2135
03:01:49,901 --> 03:01:50,581
Mr. President, if I could.

2136
03:01:51,562 --> 03:01:52,783
Thank you, Mr. Superintendent.

2137
03:01:53,463 --> 03:01:54,023
Counselor.

2138
03:01:54,103 --> 03:01:59,666
The security of our children relies on secure building.

2139
03:02:00,607 --> 03:02:03,488
And that is a functional value, to have a secure building.

2140
03:02:04,254 --> 03:02:09,418
and to have a functional security after hours, too, when a building's open.

2141
03:02:10,839 --> 03:02:13,601
That's what we have to rely on, Mr. President.

2142
03:02:14,222 --> 03:02:15,323
And that's an important issue.

2143
03:02:16,464 --> 03:02:17,765
And it shouldn't take a back seat.

2144
03:02:18,668 --> 03:02:20,009
It really should take a back seat.

2145
03:02:20,029 --> 03:02:24,873
You know, I wish there was all this dialogue when they hired a $90,000 PR person.

2146
03:02:25,613 --> 03:02:30,357
Where was all this discussion putting a $90,000 PR person in the budget?

2147
03:02:30,817 --> 03:02:33,779
Where was all this great debate saying, can we afford it or not?

2148
03:02:34,540 --> 03:02:40,504
You know, so these are the issues that I don't buy when someone stands up and says, well, we have to make the tough decisions.

2149
03:02:41,245 --> 03:02:45,048
You know, it seems to me those decisions are made, but they're made for political purpose.

2150
03:02:45,902 --> 03:02:52,384
And the tough decision is not going with the political, but going with what's right to do and saying, I need security in this building.

2151
03:02:52,664 --> 03:02:55,645
I need to make sure the doors are secured after hours.

2152
03:02:56,025 --> 03:02:57,786
That's the right thing to do, Mr. President.

2153
03:02:58,046 --> 03:03:12,691
And I'm not going to sit here, Mr. President, and state anything other than the fact that I believe there's a severe security shortfall.

2154
03:03:12,731 --> 03:03:13,091
Thank you.

2155
03:03:13,912 --> 03:03:14,492
At the high school.

2156
03:03:15,413 --> 03:03:16,914
And this superintendent's on notice.

2157
03:03:17,835 --> 03:03:18,936
So, he's on notice.

2158
03:03:19,756 --> 03:03:22,438
And let me tell you, and this is not the first year I brought this up.

2159
03:03:22,799 --> 03:03:27,162
So, when they say they'll have discussion, I've heard this year after year after year.

2160
03:03:27,182 --> 03:03:28,043
There'll be discussion.

2161
03:03:29,844 --> 03:03:30,484
Mr. President.

2162
03:03:30,865 --> 03:03:31,906
Thank you, Counsel Max.

2163
03:03:32,606 --> 03:03:35,688
I just want to comment on something that keeps coming up.

2164
03:03:36,809 --> 03:03:44,395
You know, I've sat here and listened to everyone talk about the lack of communication, the lack of information, the lack of stuff that's going out to the public.

2165
03:03:44,725 --> 03:03:48,768
I want to tell you, that public information officer has put an awful lot of stuff on the street.

2166
03:03:49,148 --> 03:03:51,730
There's an awful lot of information in this community about the schools.

2167
03:03:52,151 --> 03:03:56,574
More information than you've ever had before, and people are telling me that.

2168
03:03:56,914 --> 03:03:57,475
And you know what?

2169
03:03:57,915 --> 03:03:59,356
We can disagree on that, too.

2170
03:03:59,757 --> 03:04:05,001
But the reality is, is that you talk about public information, they're getting it from the schools.

2171
03:04:05,821 --> 03:04:07,142
They're getting it from the schools.

2172
03:04:08,303 --> 03:04:08,483
Huh?

2173
03:04:09,885 --> 03:04:11,886
You'll see the budget soon as you approve it.

2174
03:04:11,906 --> 03:04:12,627
It'll go right up.

2175
03:04:14,107 --> 03:04:15,688
just like it has every year.

2176
03:04:16,468 --> 03:04:22,692
And if you want to change that, you just simply vote to have people put their proposed budgets up.

2177
03:04:22,732 --> 03:04:23,172
That's all.

2178
03:04:23,812 --> 03:04:25,153
But you never did that.

2179
03:04:25,213 --> 03:04:27,154
All you did was ask, what do you call it, to put the money up.

2180
03:04:27,174 --> 03:04:29,155
That was a perfect statement, the superintendent just said.

2181
03:04:29,475 --> 03:04:32,037
Just like we have seen year after year.

2182
03:04:32,737 --> 03:04:34,778
That's exactly what this government's all about.

2183
03:04:34,858 --> 03:04:35,579
Thank you, counsel.

2184
03:04:35,959 --> 03:04:37,820
Just as we've done it year after year.

2185
03:04:37,840 --> 03:04:38,020
Thank you.

2186
03:04:38,880 --> 03:04:39,821
Madam Vice President.

2187
03:04:40,261 --> 03:04:41,562
While the superintendent was up there,

2188
03:04:42,275 --> 03:04:43,736
I was going to bring up the same point.

2189
03:04:44,076 --> 03:04:56,163
I think that having security after 3.30 and on weekends to protect 13, 14, 15, 16, 17-year-olds is much more important than a school blog.

2190
03:04:56,183 --> 03:05:08,591
I was going to ask the opinion on that, because I believe maintenance and security is far more important than having a PR person.

2191
03:05:08,991 --> 03:05:10,272
Thank you, Madam Vice President.

2192
03:05:11,567 --> 03:05:12,148
Councilor Knight.

2193
03:05:12,468 --> 03:05:13,769
Move the previous question, Mr. President.

2194
03:05:15,210 --> 03:05:19,354
Question moved by Councilor Knight that all debate end.

2195
03:05:19,714 --> 03:05:21,315
Mr. Clerk, call the roll.

2196
03:05:21,655 --> 03:05:21,936
No.

2197
03:05:22,216 --> 03:05:23,297
There's a motion on the floor.

2198
03:05:23,337 --> 03:05:24,498
Mr. Clerk, call the roll.

2199
03:05:24,718 --> 03:05:28,581
Mr. President, I withdraw the motion provided that we maintain the 10-minute rule.

2200
03:05:28,601 --> 03:05:30,783
10-minute rule is in application.

2201
03:05:31,344 --> 03:05:34,766
Mr. Citizen, please state your name and address for the record.

2202
03:05:34,786 --> 03:05:37,309
My name is Robert Pentez, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

2203
03:05:37,469 --> 03:05:38,990
I'm a member of the Saugus body.

2204
03:05:39,455 --> 03:05:45,478
You know, during this past campaign for the mayor's office, the term that the president and mayor used was partners in progress.

2205
03:05:45,538 --> 03:05:51,142
And partners in progress doesn't seem to be the staple that took place during this particular budgetary season.

2206
03:05:51,282 --> 03:05:59,366
As Councilor Lungo-Kern has alluded to, if you only got three minutes of the mayor and the initial presentation of a budget, and then you had to fend for yourself after the fact.

2207
03:05:59,866 --> 03:06:06,270
And I think one of the comments, and I don't know what councilor made it, that many, many questions were asked more this year than ever before.

2208
03:06:06,640 --> 03:06:09,141
This probably is a result of the answers worth forthcoming.

2209
03:06:09,221 --> 03:06:10,562
That's why you ask so many questions.

2210
03:06:11,402 --> 03:06:19,606
But a few of the things that I'd like to highlight, and this particular budget starts going back to a year ago, when this former budget was being presented by Louise Miller.

2211
03:06:20,146 --> 03:06:28,790
The question was asked of her twice, and it was by myself, when Mr. Scarpelli, Council Counsel Scott Scarpelli is sitting, would you present the budget in the same way it has been presented?

2212
03:06:28,830 --> 03:06:29,571
And she said no.

2213
03:06:30,031 --> 03:06:32,452
And we went through the idea of presenting the budget that had

2214
03:06:33,262 --> 03:06:38,924
a wish list of a cost analysis of each and every department had bringing forth that for which they wanted.

2215
03:06:39,444 --> 03:06:40,605
Now you didn't get it this year.

2216
03:06:40,645 --> 03:06:41,525
And unfortunately, why?

2217
03:06:41,585 --> 03:06:55,530
I don't know, because you have the same mayor who was the former budget director who relinquished that position to give it to Louise mill, who presented the budget, who indicated to you at that point in time that you would be getting hopefully a budget that would handle the request of the council that you didn't get.

2218
03:06:56,070 --> 03:06:59,491
But I guess we're talking about old school and it just didn't come to fruition.

2219
03:07:00,093 --> 03:07:18,000
So some of the things that I would be concerned about if I was still sitting on your side would be a new police station, something that you, Councilor De La Ruza, alluded to some three to four years ago as the number one priority of the Memphis City Council, a brand new police station for the police officers of this city and for the safety and the concern of the citizens of this community.

2220
03:07:18,740 --> 03:07:20,140
Absolutely no discussion about it.

2221
03:07:21,301 --> 03:07:23,722
It was a bone of contention during this past campaign.

2222
03:07:24,182 --> 03:07:27,243
President's administration says it would be a minimum of seven years out.

2223
03:07:27,667 --> 03:07:30,168
And we all know right now what's going on in that police station.

2224
03:07:30,208 --> 03:07:31,969
You know, it's rat infested.

2225
03:07:32,209 --> 03:07:33,189
It has mold in it.

2226
03:07:33,569 --> 03:07:35,330
It has police officers that are sick.

2227
03:07:35,390 --> 03:07:40,952
And it just cannot accommodate the everyday needs of a modern society, a police department.

2228
03:07:41,952 --> 03:07:51,836
You know, just a little real quick, when you talked about the box lunches for the workers on Election Day, it's interesting where the mayor found the money to have the mayor's office done completely over.

2229
03:07:52,336 --> 03:07:55,097
But we can't find the money to take care, unfortunately, the people.

2230
03:07:55,417 --> 03:08:01,882
who work on a daily basis, once a year or twice a year, depending on the primary and the final elections that take place.

2231
03:08:02,302 --> 03:08:06,685
You know, I think it's a service, minimal as it might be, that they deserve something having.

2232
03:08:07,165 --> 03:08:23,757
I haven't heard anybody talk about the fact that, I know there's approximately $20,000 in the budget that the mayor is required to put in, and she has to pay the entire cost of what you folks have hired an outside attorney to bring the 61 Locust Street issue to bear in hand, but nobody's talked about

2233
03:08:24,227 --> 03:08:45,563
which has been on the council agenda for many years, of looking at a new fire station on Riverside Avenue and possibly looking at a satellite fire station that sits on the opposite side of Wellington Station, where the station landing is, where the new development of 200 more units are going up, which are right opposite the Wellington Station, plus the whole commercial industrial area over there.

2234
03:08:45,943 --> 03:08:50,687
And I think that's something that really needs to be addressed, over and beyond the fact that if you look at your budget,

2235
03:08:51,445 --> 03:08:56,028
In this year's budget, your fire department overtime money was there.

2236
03:08:56,788 --> 03:09:01,872
But once again, on the annual basis, on the police department side, their overtime money wasn't there.

2237
03:09:01,992 --> 03:09:04,193
It has to be transferred each and every year.

2238
03:09:04,573 --> 03:09:14,420
Now that's a serious question to ask, because they range anywhere from $400,000 to $600,000 a year in overtime, where the fire department has their money in overtime built right in.

2239
03:09:14,680 --> 03:09:16,801
Why that happens in the police department, I don't know.

2240
03:09:17,141 --> 03:09:19,903
But if you want a true and accurate accounting of what overtime costs,

2241
03:09:20,169 --> 03:09:25,010
or projected overtime costs, that money should be definitive right in there.

2242
03:09:25,530 --> 03:09:29,831
Also, you built a new $14.1 million Department of Public Works building.

2243
03:09:30,391 --> 03:09:35,412
It's understaffed, and you don't have the right equipment to do all the jobs that are necessary on a daily basis.

2244
03:09:35,852 --> 03:09:42,194
Right now, you're dealing with an interim temporary supervisor, a director of the building over there.

2245
03:09:42,574 --> 03:09:43,874
I just don't know where it's going.

2246
03:09:44,474 --> 03:09:48,775
And a lot of this click it, fix it idea of what are being asked to be fixed,

2247
03:09:49,217 --> 03:09:53,318
are being mocked off as being completed, and they haven't even been addressed, they haven't even been resolved.

2248
03:09:53,758 --> 03:09:57,039
And why these things are being resolved through the Department of Public Works, I don't know.

2249
03:09:57,760 --> 03:10:00,681
If somebody's making a mistake or it's an error, for whatever it might be.

2250
03:10:02,101 --> 03:10:12,284
Also, you talked about, Councilman Marks, you also alluded to the fact that $400,000 from the water and sewer on the school department and the city side is basically borne by the taxpayers of this community.

2251
03:10:12,804 --> 03:10:18,346
You know, it's an interesting analysis because many years ago, when we were talking about the new INI that was coming in,

2252
03:10:18,880 --> 03:10:33,024
and we were doing High Street, and the MWRA was in here putting in new water lines, especially at the intersection of Governor's Avenue and High Street, there was a project cost in that particular area of quite a few dollars.

2253
03:10:33,064 --> 03:10:35,365
I forget the exact amount, so I won't lead it to it.

2254
03:10:35,785 --> 03:10:44,407
But part of the mitigation that took place as a result of that is they had to do High Street, I believe from Medford Square, a little bit past CVS,

2255
03:10:44,865 --> 03:10:53,052
to do that street over as part of the mitigation for the cost of putting these two things in there, relining the street and making the connections right there.

2256
03:10:53,472 --> 03:10:58,316
As a matter of fact, I think it was right out in front of Carlings where the sewer just fell into the ground.

2257
03:10:58,356 --> 03:11:01,879
And I think a lady got hurt, and that was precipitous of what took place.

2258
03:11:02,539 --> 03:11:07,343
But the $400,000 is just a drop in the bucket to the $8.5 million that's presently sitting

2259
03:11:07,767 --> 03:11:14,751
and the water and sewer account, you know, and what major projects do you have lined up where those monies can be expended?

2260
03:11:15,011 --> 03:11:16,611
I mean, I didn't hear it, I didn't see it.

2261
03:11:16,631 --> 03:11:32,679
I think last week there was a conversation with some folks on looking at cities and, I mean, streets to be done, and I believe Evans Street was one of them that they were talking about, and I believe the comment was that we'll be getting to the water and sewer portion of it, but we probably won't get to the paving of it until next week.

2262
03:11:33,620 --> 03:11:35,761
I just hope that this council is not getting buffaloed

2263
03:11:36,114 --> 03:11:40,917
and to passing a budget that's not taking an understanding into what streets are going to be done.

2264
03:11:41,258 --> 03:11:45,160
And then all of a sudden next year, in election year, all these streets decided to get done.

2265
03:11:45,480 --> 03:11:47,322
And a major cost is going to come out.

2266
03:11:47,582 --> 03:11:50,644
And maybe this is what this whole capital improvement program is going to be all about.

2267
03:11:50,984 --> 03:11:51,364
I don't know.

2268
03:11:51,825 --> 03:12:03,993
But it's not fair for the people who have been waiting year in and year out, waiting for their street to be done, waiting for their manholes on their street to be fixed, waiting for their sidewalks to be taken care of, waiting for their tree stumps to be removed.

2269
03:12:04,410 --> 03:12:06,872
And the number that you were given a few weeks ago is absolutely wrong.

2270
03:12:07,212 --> 03:12:12,395
There's many more than two to three to 400 tree stumps that are out there that need to be corrected and taken care of.

2271
03:12:13,036 --> 03:12:20,280
You also, um, and in the last election, we talked about the CPA, whether you were for it or against it.

2272
03:12:20,300 --> 03:12:25,384
And here you are in June, almost seven months later, and there's still no definitive program.

2273
03:12:25,664 --> 03:12:30,247
There is still nothing out there to tell the people what that money is going to be used for and when it's going to be used.

2274
03:12:30,654 --> 03:12:39,200
And if you look at the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, they don't even know if they're going to be able to fund it this year, because they're behind on revenues and revenue projections that they had anticipated coming in.

2275
03:12:39,900 --> 03:12:41,981
So the people of this community have to have an understanding.

2276
03:12:42,261 --> 03:12:55,410
If you voted for the CPA for the 1.5%, I believe that's what they voted for, as the override on your taxes, over and beyond your taxes, which to me is an end run of Proposition 2.5, but that's nearly over there, you're still going to be funding the whole thing on your own.

2277
03:12:55,450 --> 03:13:00,133
And you're not going to be getting that for which you thought the match was going to be from the state, because they just don't have the money.

2278
03:13:00,570 --> 03:13:02,570
And unfortunately, you're stuck with it for five years.

2279
03:13:03,251 --> 03:13:14,753
But I think I believe that it's in Councillor Knight's committee that you're working on, the ad hoc committee, and waiting to make a finality of where it's going to go.

2280
03:13:14,813 --> 03:13:24,335
And hopefully, the recommendation will come out, and people will have an opportunity to discuss it, and you can get a feeling of where you're going to be going.

2281
03:13:24,855 --> 03:13:26,235
There's been absolutely no upgrading.

2282
03:13:26,905 --> 03:13:34,588
On the antiquated cable casting of this council chamber, what transmits over cable television, whether it be Comcast or Verizon.

2283
03:13:34,688 --> 03:13:37,869
Verizon seems to have a better signal going out rather than Comcast.

2284
03:13:38,229 --> 03:13:42,390
This building hasn't been touched for well over 30 years, and I would suggest that you do it.

2285
03:13:42,450 --> 03:13:49,613
And then you have an excess of the cable access money, an excess of $550,000 just sitting there.

2286
03:13:49,913 --> 03:13:54,875
And it's never been done, and it's never been done to be used to correct this particular building over here.

2287
03:13:57,118 --> 03:14:00,420
There's a whole bunch of things that you folks have been getting into.

2288
03:14:00,440 --> 03:14:07,605
One of the things I want to compliment the council on, and you took the bull by the horns for the last couple of weeks, is the Locust Street project.

2289
03:14:08,066 --> 03:14:11,308
That's 61 Locust Street, 490 unit project on Locust Street.

2290
03:14:11,929 --> 03:14:25,118
I compliment you publicly because it really is an issue that is disturbing to the neighborhood and it'll destroy the entire fabric, not only of the Wellington neighborhood, it has an immediate impact on the entire city of Medford, if in fact that were to come to fruition.

2291
03:14:25,688 --> 03:14:32,234
Without going through all the particulars and all the facts that are relegated to it, I thank you for taking that position and voting seven to nothing.

2292
03:14:32,694 --> 03:14:37,479
Very rare do you get seven to nothing vote on something like this, but you did the right thing on this particular- You have one minute, sir.

2293
03:14:37,499 --> 03:14:37,799
Pardon me?

2294
03:14:38,019 --> 03:14:38,700
You have one minute.

2295
03:14:38,760 --> 03:14:42,904
You did the right thing as it relates to this particular subject matter.

2296
03:14:43,624 --> 03:14:50,631
I just want to conclude probably by saying that I would hope you have a new budget director coming on board.

2297
03:14:52,131 --> 03:14:53,272
has been here for a long time.

2298
03:14:53,432 --> 03:14:56,874
I happen to like Anne, and I think she does a good job, and I think she's a very honest person.

2299
03:14:57,334 --> 03:15:05,859
But I think she was put in a very tough situation as it relates to presenting not only the budget before you folks, but before the Medford City Council and city government.

2300
03:15:05,919 --> 03:15:07,660
So I thank you for your efforts, Anne.

2301
03:15:08,280 --> 03:15:20,047
But more importantly, I would just hope this council gets its act together by demanding from this mayor that before any budget comes forward, before any capital improvement comes forward, she sits down with you personally, not an emissary,

2302
03:15:20,430 --> 03:15:23,751
When in fact, she did have a representative who was supposed to be your council emissary.

2303
03:15:24,171 --> 03:15:25,011
She's not here tonight.

2304
03:15:25,451 --> 03:15:26,091
They're never here.

2305
03:15:26,171 --> 03:15:29,212
Unfortunately, you have to do this on your own and vote on it on your own.

2306
03:15:29,732 --> 03:15:34,813
So once again, I thank you for listening to my comments and at the same time.

2307
03:15:45,916 --> 03:15:46,256
Thank you.

2308
03:15:47,136 --> 03:15:48,277
I just want to thank you.

2309
03:15:48,417 --> 03:15:48,777
Okay.

2310
03:15:49,317 --> 03:15:49,937
Without calling you.

2311
03:15:57,103 --> 03:15:57,743
Councilor Knight.

2312
03:15:59,224 --> 03:16:00,624
Move the previous question, Mr. President.

2313
03:16:01,164 --> 03:16:03,805
Previous question by Councilor Knight was to end debate.

2314
03:16:03,845 --> 03:16:05,126
Mr. Clerk, call the roll.

2315
03:16:08,527 --> 03:16:10,347

No.

2323
03:16:15,049 --> 03:16:15,369
Is it?

2324
03:16:16,630 --> 03:16:16,830
Yes.

2325
03:16:17,990 --> 03:16:18,630
Councilor Martins.

2326
03:16:18,990 --> 03:16:19,290

2328
03:16:20,831 --> 03:16:20,991

Mr. President, motion to approve the paper before the body.

2333
03:16:32,141 --> 03:16:40,228
Motion to approve the amended budget presented June 15, 2016 by Councilor Knight.

2334
03:16:40,288 --> 03:16:41,609
Is there a second on the floor?

2335
03:16:42,530 --> 03:16:44,071
Second by Councilor Caviello.

2336
03:16:44,111 --> 03:16:45,192

2339
03:16:51,057 --> 03:16:51,237
Yes.

2340
03:16:51,812 --> 03:16:52,292
Councilor Night?

2341
03:16:52,352 --> 03:16:52,853
Yes.

2342
03:16:53,133 --> 03:16:54,074
Vice President O'Karan?

2343
03:16:54,114 --> 03:16:54,334
No.

2344
03:16:54,975 --> 03:16:55,475
Councilor Motz?

2345
03:16:55,755 --> 03:16:56,055
No.

2346
03:16:56,416 --> 03:16:57,176
Councilor Scott Kelly?

2347
03:16:57,276 --> 03:16:57,497
Yes.

2348
03:16:57,957 --> 03:16:58,738
President Del Rosso?

2349
03:16:59,018 --> 03:16:59,318
Yes.

2350
03:16:59,558 --> 03:17:08,345
With a vote of five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the budget is passed.

2351
03:17:08,786 --> 03:17:12,589
Mr. President, motion to take paper 16568 off the table, please.

2352
03:17:12,989 --> 03:17:18,734
On the motion of Councilor Night to take paper 16568 off the table, year-end transfers.

2353
03:17:20,655 --> 03:17:21,256
Is there a motion?

2354
03:17:22,265 --> 03:17:31,732
Mr. President, it's my understanding that these transfers are required to be made so that there are no accounts in deficit or surplus at the end of the fiscal year, and it's required by municipal finance law, as presented by Ms.

2355
03:17:31,752 --> 03:17:32,592
Baker last meeting.

2356
03:17:32,953 --> 03:17:34,794
As such, I would move for approval.

2357
03:17:34,834 --> 03:17:36,315

03:17:36,355 --> 03:17:37,416
Mr. Clerk, call the roll.

Yes, the transfers.

2361
03:17:45,841 --> 03:17:46,542
Councilor Caviello?

2362
03:17:57,038 --> 03:18:03,820
Yes, with the vote of six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

2363

The tabled records of the meeting of June 14th, 2016, pass to Councilor Marks.

2364
03:18:09,781 --> 03:18:11,541
Mr. Councilor, how do you find those records?

2365
03:18:15,742 --> 03:18:18,863
On the motion of Councilor Knight to table those records, all those in favor?

2366
03:18:19,323 --> 03:18:20,023

Those records are tabled.

2381
03:19:14,125 --> 03:19:16,687
