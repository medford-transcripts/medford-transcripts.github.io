1
00:00:02,478 --> 00:00:05,340
[SPEAKER_16]: Thirty-fifth regular meeting of the Medford City Council will come to order.

00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:06,881

00:00:10,303 --> 00:00:10,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Present.

7
00:00:11,024 --> 00:00:11,644

[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks?

12
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:16,708
[SPEAKER_23]: Present.

13
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:19,429
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Penta?

14
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:19,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Present.

15
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:22,932
[SPEAKER_11]: President Dello Russo?

16
00:00:23,012 --> 00:00:23,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Present.

17
00:00:23,472 --> 00:00:25,073
[SPEAKER_16]: Seven members present, none absent.

18
00:00:25,113 --> 00:00:27,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Please rise and join me in saluting the flag.

19
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:44,223
[SPEAKER_16]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:44,243 --> 00:00:57,373
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-758 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved the Council President establish and appoint an ad hoc CPA subcommittee to work on the implementation of the voter approved Community Preservation Act

21
00:00:58,459 --> 00:00:59,820
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

22
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:01,962
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

23
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:08,528
[SPEAKER_09]: As we are all well aware, several weeks ago, the Community Preservation Act was passed by way of ballot question.

24
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:15,214
[SPEAKER_09]: The next step in the process would be for the Medford City Council to establish a Community Preservation Commission, Mr. President.

25
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:18,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been on the phone with the Community Preservation Coalition, which is a

26
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:24,015
[SPEAKER_09]: an organization that helps administer the setup of the community preservation committees.

27
00:01:24,355 --> 00:01:31,619
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, I bring this resolution forward so that we can sit down and invite them to join us and provide us with some technical expertise as to how to move forward in this endeavor.

28
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:32,459
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

29
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:35,021
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion of approved by council and I, councilor Penta.

30
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:44,326
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the unfortunate things about this past election, it's over 3000 people didn't have an opportunity to vote on this because they weren't either instructed or they failed to turn over their ballot.

31
00:01:44,963 --> 00:01:55,189
[SPEAKER_02]: which basically would have enlightened us as to what was the real true feeling of the folks here within this community, recognizing that it was a tax on top of the tax that they were already paying.

32
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:07,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would hope when, when, and if in fact this committee ever does take place, um, that a complete explanation as to this five year commitment that needs to take place by the city.

33
00:02:07,216 --> 00:02:12,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and unfortunately the taxpayers will not have an opportunity to have a choice.

34
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:12,940
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be the committee.

35
00:02:13,403 --> 00:02:15,564
[SPEAKER_02]: that will be appointed, they don't make that choice.

36
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:23,806
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vote that took place this past November gave no indication as to what, if any, this money was going to be used for.

37
00:02:23,886 --> 00:02:29,048
[SPEAKER_02]: And more importantly, and most importantly, the guarantee from the state is only at 18 percent.

38
00:02:29,088 --> 00:02:30,168
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not at 100 percent.

39
00:02:30,188 --> 00:02:40,071
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result of that, taxpayers for the next five years and this year happens to be the lowest of all the years that CPA, since it's been around since 2001, it's the lowest it's ever been.

40
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:50,536
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it continues to go in this mainstream, the taxpayers of this community are going to wind up paying for something that they never got their commitment back from the commonwealth.

41
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:57,221
[SPEAKER_02]: So unfortunately, the misinformation that went out there, the guarantee of the money coming back from the state is absolutely not there.

42
00:02:57,662 --> 00:03:08,951
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that it's a five-year commitment and the fact that almost 3,000 people failed to vote on this because they either not instructed or they didn't turn that ballot over, I just don't think it's a real true indication.

43
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:13,055
[SPEAKER_02]: of where the city wants to go on having another tax on top of a tax.

44
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:13,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

45
00:03:14,035 --> 00:03:14,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, if I may.

46
00:03:15,336 --> 00:03:16,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

47
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:21,599
[SPEAKER_09]: I bring the resolution forward because it's our duty, based upon the legislation that was passed by the voters.

48
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:26,602
[SPEAKER_09]: This is by no way a referendum on whether or not this ballot question was a good question, a bad question, or anything else.

49
00:03:27,983 --> 00:03:31,805
[SPEAKER_09]: The fact of the matter is, the question was on the ballot, the question passed, and now the ball's in our court.

50
00:03:32,257 --> 00:03:33,898
[SPEAKER_09]: to move forward and implement, Mr. President.

51
00:03:33,918 --> 00:03:37,501
[SPEAKER_09]: I know Councilor Penta was very supportive of this endeavor back in 2001, I believe.

52
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,924
[SPEAKER_09]: He actually brought this paper to the table and asked the council to vote in favor of it at that point in time.

53
00:03:41,685 --> 00:03:44,947
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Mr. President, I'd ask that the committee be set up, that there's no need for further debate.

54
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:46,228
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the next step in the process.

55
00:03:46,869 --> 00:03:47,489
[SPEAKER_09]: It is what it is.

56
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,051
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the vote passed, the vote passed.

57
00:03:49,671 --> 00:03:55,736
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's on us to move forward and be sure that we take the appropriate steps and meet our obligation and our duty and do what we were elected to do.

58
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:57,858
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much, Councilor Knight.

59
00:03:59,789 --> 00:04:13,500
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that the taxpayers need to be aware of is the fact that, yes, while it might have won by some 1,200 votes and 3,000 people didn't vote for it, the fact of the matter is they didn't have an opportunity to know what they were going to be voting for and on.

60
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,762
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the difference between now and 2001.

61
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:18,264
[SPEAKER_02]: So whenever this committee is set up,

62
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:34,255
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they really need to have a full-fledged understanding of maybe having some public meetings to take place to get an idea, and the five categories that are out there that it's offering, what the money can and will be used for, not because of the decision of a nine-member committee.

63
00:04:34,555 --> 00:04:35,615
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm trying to say.

64
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:38,895
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the difference between then and now, and that's a big difference.

65
00:04:40,256 --> 00:04:45,897
[SPEAKER_09]: Again, Mr. President, I think that the committee would be tasked with the function as to determine how many public hearings are going to happen, what the process is going to be.

66
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:48,277
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that's something that should be done as a community, as a group.

67
00:04:48,827 --> 00:04:52,290
[SPEAKER_09]: with a number of people putting their heads together to determine what the best practices are, Mr. President.

68
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,252
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

69
00:04:54,652 --> 00:05:01,218
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Adam Knight, citizen, you'd like to speak, please say your name and address for the record.

70
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:01,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Welcome.

71
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

72
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:07,803
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Robert Capucci of 71 Evans Street.

73
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:14,749
[SPEAKER_05]: And speaking specifically to the agenda item that Councilor Knight brought up,

74
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:25,086
[SPEAKER_05]: What you'll be voting for is a subcommittee to discuss how this City Council is going to go ahead now that this vote is passed.

75
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:36,413
[SPEAKER_05]: And my question, Mr. President, I guess to Councilor Knight, through you, the Chair, is will this subcommittee be a public meeting that everyone can attend?

76
00:05:37,674 --> 00:05:41,516
[SPEAKER_16]: I can answer that if you'd like, but we'll allow Councilor Knight to answer that question.

77
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,929
[SPEAKER_16]: matters of open meeting laws?

78
00:05:46,969 --> 00:05:48,811
[SPEAKER_09]: The easy answer to that question, Mr. President, is yes.

79
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:52,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

80
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:52,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

81
00:05:52,993 --> 00:05:55,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Further to, Mr. President, please, if I could.

82
00:05:56,896 --> 00:06:10,966
[SPEAKER_05]: If I understand this law correctly, another question would be, in listening to Councilor Knight speak, is that this body now sets up that full nine-member

83
00:06:12,127 --> 00:06:16,468
[SPEAKER_05]: committee, and from the way I understand it, it's a nine-member seat.

84
00:06:16,988 --> 00:06:21,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Five of the seats are already preordained from various departments, like environment.

85
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,691
[SPEAKER_05]: But the other four seats is what this body has power and control over.

86
00:06:27,711 --> 00:06:28,151
[SPEAKER_05]: As to how.

87
00:06:28,171 --> 00:06:30,852
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Mr. President, that is inaccurate.

88
00:06:31,452 --> 00:06:32,792
[SPEAKER_09]: That is inaccurate, Mr. President.

89
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:35,133
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at section 5A of the CPA statute,

90
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:37,747
[SPEAKER_09]: The CPC must consist of at least five members.

91
00:06:37,787 --> 00:06:41,590
[SPEAKER_09]: The council has the ability to establish four more at-large members.

92
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,190
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have to.

93
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,951
[SPEAKER_09]: It all depends on what the committee wants to do.

94
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:51,315
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not up to the council to determine whether, it's up to the council to determine whether or not they would like to have five members, six members, seven members, eight members, nine members, ten members.

95
00:06:51,555 --> 00:06:52,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not ten.

96
00:06:52,176 --> 00:06:52,776
[SPEAKER_09]: It goes up to nine.

97
00:06:53,156 --> 00:06:55,458
[SPEAKER_09]: But Mr. President, so that's actually not the case.

98
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:57,199
[SPEAKER_09]: The council doesn't have to have nine.

99
00:06:57,239 --> 00:06:58,399
[SPEAKER_09]: It can have five plus one.

100
00:06:58,439 --> 00:06:59,420
[SPEAKER_09]: It can have five plus two.

101
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,615
[SPEAKER_09]: But again, I think that it's in the best interest of the community.

102
00:07:04,176 --> 00:07:12,020
[SPEAKER_16]: If the chair understood the motion correctly, this is a motion to establish a committee to begin the process.

103
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:12,961
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

104
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:14,321
[SPEAKER_16]: This is not the final committee.

105
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:14,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

106
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,723
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is not the end of the end of the end.

107
00:07:16,743 --> 00:07:17,803
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

108
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:22,606
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that the reason that we're putting this committee together is to determine what direction we want to go in.

109
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:24,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Each community that

110
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:31,932
[SPEAKER_09]: adopts the Community Preservation Act is required to establish a community preservation committee, and that is a function of the legislative body, Mr. President.

111
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:44,196
[SPEAKER_09]: So instead of us unilaterally doing that, I think it would make more sense for us to have a subcommittee that's in place that has members of the community that are also willing to participate and be involved and help us craft something that works for everybody.

112
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Very good.

113
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:49,878
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could, Mr. President, this is, again,

114
00:07:50,529 --> 00:08:13,914
[SPEAKER_05]: part of the misinformation that went out to their Councilor, Penta was speaking on the director of preserve Medford, who was one of the lead advocates of this CPA told me personally that what has to happen now by the law is a nine member panel has to be formed in five of those people are already coming from various departments.

115
00:08:14,374 --> 00:08:17,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm getting different information from Councilor Knight tonight.

116
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:18,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a very,

117
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:20,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Very confusing thing.

118
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very taxing on the citizens.

119
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:27,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, if the messenger would like, I can share a copy of the document with the gentleman.

120
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like that very much.

121
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Messenger, if you could convey that copy.

122
00:08:32,082 --> 00:08:32,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Messenger?

123
00:08:35,044 --> 00:08:35,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

124
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:38,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

125
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

126
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

127
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,831
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

128
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:44,312
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

129
00:08:44,412 --> 00:08:46,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Jones here for DC to Road North.

130
00:08:46,073 --> 00:08:48,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a point of information for the council.

131
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:58,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, just with respect to the, uh, the amount of, um, matching funds from the state this year, I'm reading off the community preservation website dated November 17th, 2015.

132
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:07,771
[SPEAKER_01]: The Massachusetts Department of Revenue has released a community preservation trust fund distribution for each CPA municipality.

133
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:09,312
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for this year.

134
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:16,394
[SPEAKER_01]: All CPA communities will receive a 29.7% match on round one of the trust fund distribution this year.

135
00:09:18,354 --> 00:09:19,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

136
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:19,755
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

137
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:20,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

138
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:24,856
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

139
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:25,536
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

140
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:26,477
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

141
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:27,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

142
00:09:29,258 --> 00:09:30,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor requests a roll call vote.

143
00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:32,940
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

144
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:34,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso?

145
00:09:34,961 --> 00:09:35,161
Yes.

146
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:36,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello?

147
00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:37,082
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

148
00:09:37,662 --> 00:09:38,203
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

149
00:09:38,443 --> 00:09:38,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

150
00:09:39,423 --> 00:09:40,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Lungo-Koehn?

151
00:09:40,524 --> 00:09:40,664
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

152
00:09:41,444 --> 00:09:42,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks?

153
00:09:42,345 --> 00:09:42,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

154
00:09:43,065 --> 00:09:43,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta?

155
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:43,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

156
00:09:45,026 --> 00:09:45,887
[SPEAKER_16]: President Dello Russo?

157
00:09:45,927 --> 00:09:46,167
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

158
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:49,548
[SPEAKER_16]: On the vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

159
00:09:50,209 --> 00:09:53,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Now item number 15759, offered by Councilor Knight.

160
00:09:54,351 --> 00:09:58,393
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it so ordained that the City of Medford adopt the provisions

161
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:13,722
[SPEAKER_16]: of Massachusetts General Law, Chapter 68, Section 9, entitled, Deferral of Excise Tax Due by Massachusetts National Guard Members and Reservists on Active Duty and Dependents.

162
00:10:14,182 --> 00:10:15,682
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

163
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,423
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

164
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:24,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Presently in the city of Medford, I have passed out to all the members here a printout from the city's website.

165
00:10:26,527 --> 00:10:29,848
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would say, when are payments due for motor vehicle excise tax?

166
00:10:30,188 --> 00:10:34,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Payment of the motor vehicle excise tax is due within 30 days from the date the excise bill is issued.

167
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:39,509
[SPEAKER_09]: A person who does not receive a bill is still liable for the excise plus any interest charges accrued.

168
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:45,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore, it's important to keep the registry and the post office informed of current names and addresses so excise bills can be delivered promptly.

169
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:48,451
[SPEAKER_09]: All owners of motor vehicles must pay an excise tax.

170
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:54,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore, it is the responsibility of the owner to contact the treasurer's collector's office if you have not received a bill.

171
00:10:57,524 --> 00:11:02,907
[SPEAKER_09]: If an excise tax is not paid within 30 days from the issue date, the amount will be assessed a $5 demand charge plus interest.

172
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:09,051
[SPEAKER_09]: If payment in full, including the demand charge, is not received within 14 days of the date issued, a warrant with additional charges will be issued.

173
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:14,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Warrants are turned over to the Deputy Collector Kelly Ryan and Associates for further collection and registry action.

174
00:11:14,855 --> 00:11:25,501
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, Chapter 68, Section 9 of the General Laws reads, in any town accepting the provisions of this section and notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the contrary,

175
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:45,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Any excise due under this chapter by a member of the Massachusetts National Guard or Reservist or a dependent of a member of the Massachusetts National Guard or Reservist shall be deferred while that member is on active service outside the Commonwealth and for a period of up to 180 days after the completion of that service.

176
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:50,929
[SPEAKER_09]: No interest or penalty shall be assessed for any period before the expiration of the 180 days.

177
00:11:51,469 --> 00:11:56,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, a vote for this is a vote for our veterans, a vote for those that service our country, Mr. President.

178
00:11:57,097 --> 00:12:04,448
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a deferral of their excise tax that's going to be due them if they are deployed, if they are out of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for a period of time for which their excise taxes due.

179
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,792
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't cost anything to the bottom line, Mr. President.

180
00:12:07,832 --> 00:12:11,678
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the day, the excise tax responsibility still lies within the individual.

181
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:30,756
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I think that it would make sense for us to adopt this provision, considering if we have a resident in the city of Medford who is a National Guardsman who has been deployed to Iraq and their car is sitting in the driveway and their affairs are up in the air and not in quite great order because they're deployed overseas and their family life has been affected dramatically because of this.

182
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:34,779
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the least we can do, Mr. President, to provide them with some relief until they return and get their affairs in order.

183
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,182
[SPEAKER_09]: So, with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask that my council colleagues support this resolution, and I'd ask for a roll call vote.

184
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:45,108
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion approved by Councilor Knight, chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

185
00:12:46,328 --> 00:12:52,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I definitely support this this evening and I want to applaud Councilor Knight for bringing this forward.

186
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:58,896
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, all too often everyone sits behind this rail and in other elected positions throughout the Commonwealth.

187
00:12:59,096 --> 00:13:04,620
[SPEAKER_07]: We say we're father veterans and we stand proudly with the veterans on Veterans Day and on Memorial Day.

188
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,461
[SPEAKER_07]: We honor the sacrifice that many have made.

189
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:09,743
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is a real tangible piece of

190
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:19,662
[SPEAKER_07]: legislation that this council can stand behind boldly and send the message loud and clear that we're walking the walk, not just talking the talk when it comes to supporting the veterans.

191
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:27,067
[SPEAKER_07]: So on behalf of the local veterans, I'd like to thank Councilor Knight for bringing this up and I support it wholeheartedly.

192
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I've got no problem supporting it.

193
00:13:33,892 --> 00:13:38,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to put a B paper attached to that because is there any kind of a law that exists out there that

194
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:46,295
[SPEAKER_02]: holds and abeyance any service person's mortgage payments until such time that they come back home?

195
00:13:46,335 --> 00:14:01,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Because sometimes if an individual goes overseas or is in the service and he has a family here and they just can't meet the financial obligations that are required of a mortgage payment, just like we're doing with the excise tax and the cars, is there any kind of law out there?

196
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:02,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we get an answer back?

197
00:14:02,728 --> 00:14:08,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there some kind of law that holds and abeyance mortgage payments until such time as the service person comes back?

198
00:14:12,449 --> 00:14:14,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Mortgage payments or property tax payments, Councilor?

199
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:15,992
[SPEAKER_02]: Mortgage payments on their home.

200
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,273
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a function of the council.

201
00:14:18,313 --> 00:14:20,495
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not a function of the local government.

202
00:14:20,515 --> 00:14:22,176
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I asked for clarification.

203
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:31,343
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not be a function of the council, but it's a function if they have mortgage payments and then if the city wants to be generous enough, they can turn around and take their property tax assessment, whatever it might be.

204
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:36,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, we have so many servicemen, not only are coming home,

205
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:50,725
[SPEAKER_02]: that have post-traumatic stress, that have physical infirmities, that they have so many disabilities that are confronting them, you know, and our government on a wholesale basis is just putting a lot of this stuff on hold while they're talking about bringing in, you know, illegal refugees and

206
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:51,795
[SPEAKER_02]: things of that nature.

207
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:57,900
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we're going to take care of people within our own community, I think we should look at what can be beneficial to them.

208
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:11,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it means filing a piece of legislation, then so be it, whether it's a property tax reduction or hold that in abatement or even a mortgage, um, uh, holding a mortgage in abatement, whatever it might be, they deserve to have that benefit, uh, available to them.

209
00:15:14,074 --> 00:15:14,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Move for approval.

210
00:15:14,634 --> 00:15:15,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

211
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:16,796
[SPEAKER_16]: Move approval.

212
00:15:17,136 --> 00:15:18,798
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, the motion for approval on council,

213
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:21,068
[SPEAKER_16]: Knight's motion.

214
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,794
[SPEAKER_16]: What were you, were you an amendment to this?

215
00:15:26,934 --> 00:15:27,955
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

216
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:29,457
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

217
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:41,269
[SPEAKER_23]: I was just wondering, Mr. President, uh, if, uh, anyone in the national guard or reserve is now currently have to register with our office, our local veterans office.

218
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,540
[SPEAKER_23]: just say before they go overseas.

219
00:15:44,001 --> 00:15:49,882
[SPEAKER_23]: Is there a process in place now where at least we know who is actively involved, maybe overseas and so forth?

220
00:15:50,382 --> 00:16:07,766
[SPEAKER_16]: I think, if I may say anecdotally, I think in the process of deployment, the local veterans agent is notified by the deploying agency, whether it be National Guard, Army, Army Reserve, Navy, et cetera.

221
00:16:09,046 --> 00:16:11,567
[SPEAKER_23]: So we may be able to get a number from Ernest Lindsay on

222
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,391
[SPEAKER_23]: uh, the number of veterans.

223
00:16:13,951 --> 00:16:16,213
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, certainly he has an accurate accounting.

224
00:16:17,454 --> 00:16:22,798
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd like, I think this is a very worthy, uh, uh, resolution offered by council at night.

225
00:16:22,818 --> 00:16:29,384
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, I would like to see if we can get, uh, the potential deferral impact on the community.

226
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:33,467
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, it may be small in nature, but I think it's worthwhile to take,

227
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,481
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll look at and see what that number may be.

228
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:58,180
[SPEAKER_23]: And also, if we can get some feedback from Ernest Lindsay, our Veterans Administrator in the city, to see how many, if they do register with the Veterans Office when they go overseas, and also if members of the National Guard are all registered with the Veterans Office, or how does that work?

229
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,661
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm honestly not sure.

230
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:02,123
[SPEAKER_23]: So, you know, I think that'd be interesting to find out.

231
00:17:02,703 --> 00:17:05,205
[SPEAKER_16]: So can we add that as an amendment to the paper?

232
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:05,805
[SPEAKER_23]: Absolutely.

233
00:17:06,146 --> 00:17:14,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, the impact, it would be a zero sum impact because the obligation to pay the excise tax would still remain.

234
00:17:14,952 --> 00:17:22,638
[SPEAKER_09]: It would just be deferred until their return and it, um, penalties and interest couldn't accrue until after the 180th day of their return.

235
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:23,798
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

236
00:17:23,858 --> 00:17:25,700
[SPEAKER_09]: So, so in essence,

237
00:17:26,405 --> 00:17:32,687
[SPEAKER_09]: the financial impact would be zero because they'd be getting the same amount of excise that they would be getting if, in fact, the person wasn't deployed and was here.

238
00:17:33,128 --> 00:17:35,268
[SPEAKER_09]: The only loss that we're seeing is on penalties and interest.

239
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:42,771
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're just not penalizing an individual for being deployed and servicing the country while, you know, they're not able to be here and pay the excise.

240
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:42,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

241
00:17:42,991 --> 00:17:48,673
[SPEAKER_23]: But if they're overseas for an extended period of time, we run our budgets year by year.

242
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:53,055
[SPEAKER_23]: So if there's a large amount of deferrals in a particular year, that does impact the budget.

243
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:54,753
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not sure what the number is.

244
00:17:54,793 --> 00:17:58,034
[SPEAKER_23]: It may be very small in nature, but it would impact the budget.

245
00:17:58,474 --> 00:18:07,759
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm just asking that we get a copy from Mr. Pomp, maybe the treasurer collector's office or Ann Baker on the potential impact.

246
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,600
[SPEAKER_23]: This is a great resolution.

247
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:13,602
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of clarification of Madam Vice President.

248
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:14,802
[SPEAKER_20]: I just saw it differently.

249
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:18,984
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought I would, I would see an impact to the budget, but I would think it would be minimal.

250
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:19,845
[SPEAKER_20]: Um,

251
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:22,734
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not sure what you're saying.

252
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:27,355
[SPEAKER_20]: It's deferred, but that time that they're overseas, they don't have to pay for.

253
00:18:27,575 --> 00:18:32,357
[SPEAKER_20]: So there is a period that the city will be losing a minimal impact amount of money.

254
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:33,177
[SPEAKER_09]: The money's still due.

255
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:37,299
[SPEAKER_09]: If I say that your bill's due on January, excise tax comes out.

256
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:39,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So January, your excise tax gets levied.

257
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,100
[SPEAKER_09]: It's due by February 2.

258
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,441
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm deployed.

259
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,162
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm overseas, or I'm out of state, for that matter.

260
00:18:45,682 --> 00:18:47,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Legislation just speaks for being out of state.

261
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:48,143
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm out of state.

262
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:49,003
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm at Fort Bragg.

263
00:18:49,767 --> 00:18:51,687
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm at Fort Bragg until June.

264
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:54,528
[SPEAKER_09]: I come back on June 3rd.

265
00:18:55,228 --> 00:19:04,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I have 188 days, 180 days from June 3rd in order to pay the excise tax before I will be fined and assessed penalties.

266
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:06,250
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm telling you, I read it differently.

267
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,931
[SPEAKER_20]: I read that they don't have to pay while they're overseas and it's just that portion is deferred.

268
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,691
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't have to pay period and then you start for the 180 days.

269
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:17,452
[SPEAKER_20]: So there will be an impact to the budget.

270
00:19:17,492 --> 00:19:18,552
[SPEAKER_20]: It will just be very minimal.

271
00:19:19,327 --> 00:19:20,467
[SPEAKER_20]: how many people, you know.

272
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:21,608
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that's what we're going to find out.

273
00:19:21,748 --> 00:19:22,848
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

274
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:23,649
[SPEAKER_20]: I read that differently.

275
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:26,390
[SPEAKER_15]: Very good.

276
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:32,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilors, Mr. Capucci, if you would, please just again, state your name and address for the record.

277
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,412
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

278
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:35,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans street.

279
00:19:36,254 --> 00:19:45,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, as a veteran of the army reserves, I can, I can tell you firsthand what happens with a lot of these reservists, the national guards is,

280
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:56,384
[SPEAKER_05]: they either sign the title over to a family member, they take their car off the road, and the minimal impact would be just that.

281
00:19:56,564 --> 00:20:11,267
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a great resolution and idea, but if you really wanted to make an impact on these soldiers' lives, instead of deferring their excise tax, which they probably already made arrangements for to defer themselves,

282
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:16,598
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a long list of other taxes in the cities that could be deferred.

283
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:22,102
[SPEAKER_05]: This new CPA tax surcharge, for instance, the water tax, the property tax.

284
00:20:22,142 --> 00:20:29,386
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to really do something for these soldiers, look in that area, because this is, with all due respect, a lot of bark with no bite.

285
00:20:29,626 --> 00:20:30,547
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

286
00:20:32,028 --> 00:20:34,189
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion for approval, Councilor Knight.

287
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,171
[SPEAKER_09]: This law's been on the books for quite a period of time.

288
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:38,552
[SPEAKER_09]: The City of Medford has not adopted it.

289
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:40,315
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a local option.

290
00:20:40,475 --> 00:20:44,237
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel as though it would make perfectly good sense for us to adopt this local option, Mr. President.

291
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Bark or bite, decide.

292
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:49,418
[SPEAKER_09]: It's something that's going to help people, and it's something that I support.

293
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:50,679
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor.

294
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:59,362
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion for approval of the B paper offered by Councilor Penta as amended by Councilor Marks, all those in favour?

295
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:01,342
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

296
00:21:01,622 --> 00:21:02,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion carried.

297
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:06,784
[SPEAKER_16]: And on the main motion offered by Councilor

298
00:21:10,188 --> 00:21:10,428
[SPEAKER_16]: night.

299
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:15,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, does that require a roll call?

300
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:16,913
[SPEAKER_16]: It does as it ordained.

301
00:21:17,433 --> 00:21:19,114
[SPEAKER_16]: So, uh, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

302
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:24,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso.

303
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:25,039
Yes.

304
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:26,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello.

305
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,280
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

306
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,520
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

307
00:21:27,621 --> 00:21:27,721
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

308
00:21:27,741 --> 00:21:29,422
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice-President Long-Term.

309
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:29,522
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

310
00:21:30,282 --> 00:21:30,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

311
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:31,283
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

312
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:32,484
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta.

313
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:32,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

314
00:21:33,685 --> 00:21:34,566
[SPEAKER_16]: President Dello Russo.

315
00:21:34,646 --> 00:21:34,886
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

316
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,067
[SPEAKER_16]: With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

317
00:21:37,608 --> 00:21:39,149
[SPEAKER_16]: The, uh, order passes.

318
00:21:40,043 --> 00:21:52,871
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-760, offered by vice president Lungo-Koehn, be resolved that the council be provided with the last three years, including 2014, certified free cash numbers.

319
00:21:53,331 --> 00:21:54,512
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, madam vice president.

320
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:59,234
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, president de la russo.

321
00:21:59,755 --> 00:22:04,938
[SPEAKER_20]: Last year we asked for the preceding three years with regards to certified free cash.

322
00:22:04,978 --> 00:22:06,819
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe we had the last five years.

323
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,660
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm just looking for

324
00:22:09,894 --> 00:22:21,482
[SPEAKER_20]: My main request has to do with certified free cash numbers that probably came in sometime this month for 2014, which is the number that we obviously didn't have last year.

325
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:32,570
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I know we were averaging, it was anywhere from 500,000 to a million and a half that we're putting into free cash from any given year's budget within the last five years.

326
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:37,494
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to know, since tax discussions will be coming up in December,

327
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:46,559
[SPEAKER_20]: Next Tuesday, I believe, I'd like to have that number, if we could, what was certified free cash for the last three to five years.

328
00:22:46,579 --> 00:22:55,723
[SPEAKER_20]: If I could just amend this, three to five years, so we can make an educated decision when it comes to our decision that we need to make before the end of the year.

329
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:03,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Vice President, as amended by the Vice President, all those in favor?

330
00:23:03,974 --> 00:23:04,715
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

331
00:23:05,015 --> 00:23:07,737
[SPEAKER_16]: The motion carries.

332
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:10,279
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-761, offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

333
00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:17,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Be it resolved that the fire chief provides the council with an update on the work that has been completed on the fire stations while under warranty.

334
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:19,065
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Vice President.

335
00:23:19,286 --> 00:23:21,027
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President De La Rousseau.

336
00:23:21,982 --> 00:23:23,383
[SPEAKER_20]: We had discussions about this.

337
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:24,984
[SPEAKER_20]: I brought this up last week.

338
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:27,445
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a warranty for all the work that was done.

339
00:23:27,505 --> 00:23:44,674
[SPEAKER_20]: The million point three that went out to bond with regards to improvements at the fire stations and the fact that I've had trouble with it with regards to where the warranty is concerned.

340
00:23:44,734 --> 00:23:48,036
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we could get an update and see what work has been done

341
00:23:49,228 --> 00:24:02,176
[SPEAKER_20]: What work has been requested of the contractors or anybody who's done any work on the fire stations within the last year and how have they been improved upon or updated or made sure that the warranty is taken advantage of?

342
00:24:02,196 --> 00:24:04,558
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I know we only had a one-year warranty on that.

343
00:24:04,658 --> 00:24:10,742
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we could just get an update on what has been done under that warranty the last six months to a year.

344
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

345
00:24:17,282 --> 00:24:17,963
[SPEAKER_07]: And I support this.

346
00:24:18,664 --> 00:24:19,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, counsel.

347
00:24:20,586 --> 00:24:33,958
[SPEAKER_07]: If she doesn't mind, I'd like to make a B paper that is in line with the fire department, but the new pieces of apparatus that were just purchased over the last 12 months, the rear step on the truck, unless you wear a size 4.5 shoe,

348
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:40,268
[SPEAKER_07]: you can't safely do your job when you have to pull hose and stuff off of the back of the truck.

349
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:51,672
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about a thousand dollar part, I'm being told, I have not confirmed that, to extend the bumper so that a fire department personnel can safely stand on the rear step of these trucks.

350
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:57,934
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could ask the fire chief to look into it and to get this fixed.

351
00:24:59,035 --> 00:25:00,135
[SPEAKER_07]: In the interest of public safety,

352
00:25:00,613 --> 00:25:06,517
[SPEAKER_07]: because, uh, this, this is certainly an issue I saw it firsthand down at engine two and, uh, someone's going to get injured.

353
00:25:08,058 --> 00:25:08,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good.

354
00:25:08,678 --> 00:25:10,239
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do that as an amendment if it's all right.

355
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:26,910
[SPEAKER_16]: So, uh, on the motion of, uh, vice-president Lungo-Koehn as amended, all those in favor, all those in favor motion carries 15-seven, six, two offered by a vice-president Lungo-Koehn be resolved at the Medford city council, not approved.

356
00:25:27,437 --> 00:25:34,502
[SPEAKER_16]: of any bond or expenditure that does not have a written explanation of such expenditure at least seven days prior to said vote.

357
00:25:34,863 --> 00:25:35,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Vice President.

358
00:25:36,104 --> 00:25:37,665
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

359
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:43,409
[SPEAKER_20]: I just think we need to, we have a new administration coming in January.

360
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:46,491
[SPEAKER_20]: We have two new city councilors who are coming on board.

361
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:56,639
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think we just need to set an example and make a strong recommendation or request of the administration going forward that we

362
00:25:57,380 --> 00:26:07,007
[SPEAKER_20]: When a bond is before us, you know, we had over about $800,000 in bonds before us last week with barely minimal paperwork.

363
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:14,453
[SPEAKER_20]: Two of the three, we had absolutely nothing in front of us to review, digest, ask questions on.

364
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:18,636
[SPEAKER_20]: We're basically somebody, you know, thankfully Louise was here, Ms.

365
00:26:18,676 --> 00:26:20,137
[SPEAKER_20]: Miller was here to discuss them.

366
00:26:20,698 --> 00:26:21,979
[SPEAKER_20]: But we had nothing in writing.

367
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:23,900
[SPEAKER_20]: I was scrambling to take notes.

368
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:30,245
[SPEAKER_20]: I was scrambling to decide whether a $200,000, $300,000 expenditure was going to be a good one or a bad one.

369
00:26:30,285 --> 00:26:33,947
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's something that you can't do on the spot.

370
00:26:34,027 --> 00:26:36,269
[SPEAKER_20]: You can't even do it an hour or two beforehand.

371
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:42,593
[SPEAKER_20]: I personally would like at least seven days to digest and review.

372
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:48,117
[SPEAKER_20]: Time after time after time, we have the administration before us telling us how it's

373
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:51,200
[SPEAKER_20]: It's in dire need to be passed.

374
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,181
[SPEAKER_20]: It's urgent if we don't pass it.

375
00:26:53,541 --> 00:27:01,386
[SPEAKER_20]: And we get the A, B, C, D, and E, and F of why, if we don't pass it, it's going to not be good for the city.

376
00:27:01,406 --> 00:27:07,349
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just really want to move forward making educated decisions.

377
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:15,193
[SPEAKER_20]: I think all seven of us need to be able to have paperwork in front of us explaining whether it's $100,000 or $3 million, we need

378
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,666
[SPEAKER_20]: to have the paperwork in front of us to make an educated decision.

379
00:27:23,406 --> 00:27:36,630
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think if the seven of us stick together and the new seven in January stick together and really make that, make our voices heard that that's the way, you know, business should operate.

380
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,050
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the way a city should operate.

381
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:43,832
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the way, you know, the respect we should get because we are the ones that respond to constituents.

382
00:27:43,872 --> 00:27:45,312
[SPEAKER_20]: We are the ones that have to explain.

383
00:27:45,856 --> 00:27:50,499
[SPEAKER_20]: and understand the vote we're taking, and I think it's very important that we get the paperwork beforehand.

384
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:55,182
[SPEAKER_20]: Even if it's the Friday before a Tuesday meeting, that's better than nothing.

385
00:27:55,242 --> 00:28:09,052
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, last week we had hundreds of thousands of dollars that they wanted us to vote on, and we did not have anything in front of us besides a one-liner saying, please approve of this $200,000 bond initiative.

386
00:28:09,072 --> 00:28:11,173
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, that's on the backs of the taxpayers.

387
00:28:11,213 --> 00:28:13,975
[SPEAKER_20]: That's on the backs — our children will be paying that money back.

388
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:20,572
[SPEAKER_20]: because some of these bonds go into, you know, 20 years from now, people will still be paying them back.

389
00:28:20,952 --> 00:28:30,039
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to be able to get some documentation in support and be able to do our own research, be able to look into the numbers ourselves.

390
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:36,645
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I, for one Councilor, keep at least two to three years' worth of budget books in my office at home.

391
00:28:36,665 --> 00:28:42,549
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I have to be able to digest something, not just talk about it and vote on it 10 minutes later.

392
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:51,638
[SPEAKER_20]: And the whole issue with, you know, just scrambling, the administration scrambling to get the fourth vote, I think it's a disservice to the taxpayer.

393
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:57,940
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just hope it stops, and I hope we send a message that we, it's a no-brainer.

394
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:08,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Just give us some documentation one week prior to a vote so we can call and ask questions if we need to, so we can get our questions ready for the Tuesday night, and we can make an educated decision.

395
00:29:09,204 --> 00:29:12,825
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just want to, I'm trying to hammer it home because it's really important, and I'm

396
00:29:13,288 --> 00:29:28,556
[SPEAKER_20]: starting to get very frustrated and I hope that, you know, our two new Councilors hear me loud and clear as well and just demand the respect and demand it for the taxpayer and the rate payers and the citizens of this community and our children who will be paying back these bonds.

397
00:29:29,116 --> 00:29:30,697
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I just ask for approval.

398
00:29:30,717 --> 00:29:35,059
[SPEAKER_20]: I ask for a roll call vote and I just think it's important.

399
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:36,620
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

400
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

401
00:29:37,781 --> 00:29:40,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

402
00:29:40,602 --> 00:29:41,483
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I, too,

403
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:45,078
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that this is a good resolution in theory.

404
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:51,001
[SPEAKER_09]: However, in application, I think that there might be another way that we can do it that will not rely on us sticking together.

405
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:55,003
[SPEAKER_09]: It won't rely on an us versus them mentality, Mr. President.

406
00:29:55,023 --> 00:29:56,624
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be a change of our city council rules.

407
00:29:57,185 --> 00:30:05,390
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe if we change the rules so that no paper related to a bond or expenditure shall be introduced to our agenda.

408
00:30:06,445 --> 00:30:10,147
[SPEAKER_09]: unless we are in receipt of the paper seven days before and in writing.

409
00:30:10,807 --> 00:30:13,709
[SPEAKER_09]: That will take the ambiguousness out of it.

410
00:30:13,749 --> 00:30:15,670
[SPEAKER_09]: That will take the reliance on other members out of it.

411
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:25,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we'd also have a concern, Mr. President, we really can't preclude somebody as a member of the body from voting on a paper that they want to vote on unless we use parliamentary procedure.

412
00:30:26,195 --> 00:30:31,057
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, tabling at section 22 and at section 20.4, which we learned a little bit about a couple weeks ago.

413
00:30:31,868 --> 00:30:35,190
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly agree with Councilor Longo.

414
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,371
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with everything she's saying.

415
00:30:36,631 --> 00:30:40,594
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I think there might be a stronger mechanism in order for us to implement such.

416
00:30:41,895 --> 00:30:52,921
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd ask that the matter be referred to the Rules Committee for construction of a rule that would govern the City Council and govern and dictate how money papers are going to be introduced to our agenda.

417
00:30:53,882 --> 00:30:58,385
[SPEAKER_09]: If we don't get the seven-day explanation, if we don't get the explanation within seven days, it doesn't get put on the agenda.

418
00:30:58,878 --> 00:31:00,879
[SPEAKER_09]: If matter doesn't get in the agenda, it never reaches the floor.

419
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,520
[SPEAKER_09]: If it never reaches the floor, it doesn't reach a vote.

420
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,821
[SPEAKER_09]: And if it doesn't reach a vote, the expense doesn't get expended.

421
00:31:04,841 --> 00:31:08,382
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor.

422
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councilor Penta.

423
00:31:10,283 --> 00:31:12,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, we already have a rule.

424
00:31:12,424 --> 00:31:16,926
[SPEAKER_02]: It's rule number 20, disposition of all items appearing upon the council agenda.

425
00:31:17,006 --> 00:31:20,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And referring back to what Councilor Alongo-Curran has just alluded to, I agree with her 100%.

426
00:31:21,909 --> 00:31:26,691
[SPEAKER_02]: Section number four under rule 20 states that any financial paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time

427
00:31:27,323 --> 00:31:32,204
[SPEAKER_02]: shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any councillor.

428
00:31:32,884 --> 00:31:42,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Common sense would tell you that we did this a couple of weeks ago because we got over $800,000 worth of a paper in front of the papers, three separate papers, to be voted upon.

429
00:31:42,466 --> 00:31:53,849
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result of that, since we had received nothing in our informational packet on a Friday afternoon, we had laid that on the table with the hopes that we would get more and further information the following Tuesday, which was this past Tuesday evening.

430
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:56,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is again now the third Tuesday in a row.

431
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:58,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, asked for the information.

432
00:31:58,949 --> 00:32:04,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we did not receive one scintilla, one document, anything that represents itself regarding those three papers.

433
00:32:05,352 --> 00:32:08,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So the council rules are obviously in operation.

434
00:32:09,235 --> 00:32:15,338
[SPEAKER_02]: And after the seven days, if you've called a rule seven, a rule number four, excuse me, on the section four under rule 20, I apologize.

435
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:22,122
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll be able to have any one council say, listen, we haven't gotten the paperwork in front of us, you know, and we're not going to entertain this any further until such time it comes.

436
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:23,596
[SPEAKER_02]: You already have the rules there.

437
00:32:24,796 --> 00:32:27,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Sending it to the Rules Committee is nothing more than another delay tactic.

438
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:28,478
[SPEAKER_02]: You already have it.

439
00:32:28,758 --> 00:32:29,759
[SPEAKER_02]: It's built into your rules.

440
00:32:30,219 --> 00:32:38,083
[SPEAKER_02]: And common sense will tell you, if the rule tells you how you're supposed to be operating, and you fail to get the information that you're supposed to be getting, well, then you take the very next step.

441
00:32:38,103 --> 00:32:39,164
[SPEAKER_02]: You just lay it on the table.

442
00:32:39,204 --> 00:32:41,525
[SPEAKER_02]: You leave it on the table until such information.

443
00:32:41,745 --> 00:32:43,326
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we have right before us right now.

444
00:32:43,406 --> 00:32:46,048
[SPEAKER_02]: We have three papers that I would assume will just stay on the table.

445
00:32:46,388 --> 00:32:48,389
[SPEAKER_02]: We've asked for their information to be forthcoming.

446
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:53,787
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had the city audited, and then we had Louise Miller appear before us, and we still haven't gotten the information.

447
00:32:54,228 --> 00:32:58,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think right now it's operating pretty good, and it's right in front of us right now.

448
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:08,194
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think council owes the obligation to the taxpayer, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn has alluded to, to not discuss that paper until we have an opportunity to receive the information to go forward.

449
00:33:08,474 --> 00:33:10,355
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to wait for the next council to come in.

450
00:33:10,415 --> 00:33:16,598
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happening right in front of you right now with three particular papers that you've asked for the information, you've laid it on the table,

451
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:18,251
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't gotten the information.

452
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:23,693
[SPEAKER_02]: It's three weeks running, and I don't know why, but if this is the way this administration wants to work, then so be it.

453
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, the new administration doesn't do the same thing, but this is what you have in front of us.

454
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:31,556
[SPEAKER_02]: These are our rules right now, and I think they're operating pretty good on these particular matters.

455
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:32,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

456
00:33:33,097 --> 00:33:34,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Constable Benton.

457
00:33:37,099 --> 00:33:37,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

458
00:33:37,579 --> 00:33:39,880
[SPEAKER_16]: If you'd like to speak, please state your name and address for the record.

459
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome.

460
00:33:40,697 --> 00:33:41,738
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

461
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:43,839
[SPEAKER_12]: I live on 18 Pembroke Street.

462
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:51,264
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to suggest to the Councilor that she adds an amendment to this legislation.

463
00:33:51,664 --> 00:33:58,069
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be useful if information that was pertinent could be presented digitally also so people could view it at home.

464
00:33:58,889 --> 00:34:05,934
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems to be a rather small request that if there is a large item, $300,000 debt that the city is going to have to pay for,

465
00:34:06,547 --> 00:34:11,290
[SPEAKER_12]: If we could have this information available to us digitally, it'll allow us to actually do a little research beforehand.

466
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:18,894
[SPEAKER_12]: The second thing I'd also like to recommend that we could have a digital recording on all committees of the whole meetings.

467
00:34:19,894 --> 00:34:25,417
[SPEAKER_12]: Today, we just learned that there's going to be about a 7 to 15% rate increase of the water bill.

468
00:34:25,942 --> 00:34:34,766
[SPEAKER_12]: If that information could be presented digitally to the average citizen, I think that would be useful, so at least they could hear it at home.

469
00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:37,807
[SPEAKER_12]: And thirdly, I just want to address the general tone of the meeting.

470
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:48,932
[SPEAKER_12]: It's frustrating when the administration continually bulldozes through certain choices that this legislative body is governed by.

471
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:59,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there anything more we can do than just reminding the administration that they have seven days to provide financial information so people can view it?

472
00:35:00,188 --> 00:35:00,489
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

473
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:03,370
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

474
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:03,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Welcome.

475
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,191
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

476
00:35:05,211 --> 00:35:05,372
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi.

477
00:35:05,592 --> 00:35:06,792
[SPEAKER_21]: My name is Joyce Paul.

478
00:35:06,832 --> 00:35:10,595
[SPEAKER_21]: I live at 8 Mason Street in Medford, obviously.

479
00:35:11,075 --> 00:35:14,817
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to thank you for bringing up the issue of this.

480
00:35:15,558 --> 00:35:16,919
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a little bit surprised.

481
00:35:16,939 --> 00:35:18,440
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the first time I've spoken here.

482
00:35:19,267 --> 00:35:22,629
[SPEAKER_21]: I realize this evening I've heard my name mentioned many times.

483
00:35:23,209 --> 00:35:28,031
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a taxpayer, and I hear that word many, many times.

484
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:42,078
[SPEAKER_21]: I represent a lot of people who are taxpayers, and I am, like, amazed that you would spend any amount of money without having a period of time to look at it when I get my bill at the store from whatever

485
00:35:42,926 --> 00:35:51,530
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, whatever bill comes in the mail, whether it's my property taxes or anything else, I look at the bill and I think about it and I say, well, that's good or bad.

486
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:56,232
[SPEAKER_21]: I may look back on the previous bill and decide whether it's a good thing or not.

487
00:35:56,712 --> 00:36:07,497
[SPEAKER_21]: So I thank you very much for trying to be careful with my money because, um, I and all the other taxpayers would assume that you would do that.

488
00:36:07,997 --> 00:36:10,418
[SPEAKER_21]: So I definitely support, um,

489
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,702
[SPEAKER_21]: whatever you can come up with to make sure, when you spend the money, that you know what you're spending it for.

490
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:17,963
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

491
00:36:19,363 --> 00:36:19,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

492
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:27,987
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

493
00:36:28,047 --> 00:36:29,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

494
00:36:30,048 --> 00:36:32,669
[SPEAKER_18]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushion Street, Merritt, Mass.

495
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,551
[SPEAKER_18]: The most recent speaker made some good points.

496
00:36:38,211 --> 00:36:40,032
[SPEAKER_18]: I wanted to reiterate some of it.

497
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:54,862
[SPEAKER_18]: And Councilor Brianna brought up a good resolution, although Councilor Penta also mentioned we already have the tool in your chest as we speak, as he used before the Section 20, I believe it was called.

498
00:36:57,564 --> 00:37:08,872
[SPEAKER_18]: Not being a lawyer, however, I've noticed how this is written, be it resolved that the Medford City Council not approve it of any bond or expenditure

499
00:37:09,373 --> 00:37:16,619
[SPEAKER_18]: that does not have a written explanation of such expenditure at least seven days prior to the said vote.

500
00:37:18,761 --> 00:37:20,942
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little vague, a written explanation.

501
00:37:20,982 --> 00:37:29,609
[SPEAKER_18]: They could just say, I have to do, I need the money to do whatever, part three of some bridge project.

502
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:38,537
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think more importantly, we'd want some sort of itemized explanation.

503
00:37:39,747 --> 00:37:44,551
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would think that seven days prior, you should have the information.

504
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:49,374
[SPEAKER_18]: That should have been going on since day one, 100 years ago.

505
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:55,159
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you go to a bank to borrow money, they ask you why you want to borrow it.

506
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:07,628
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you want to borrow it or have the taxpayers responsible for it for the next 20 years, if it's a bond, we would think we should know what it's for.

507
00:38:08,425 --> 00:38:09,045
[SPEAKER_18]: In detail.

508
00:38:09,185 --> 00:38:09,586
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

509
00:38:10,406 --> 00:38:11,606
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

510
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:15,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

511
00:38:15,228 --> 00:38:16,168
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Mr. President.

512
00:38:16,188 --> 00:38:19,750
[SPEAKER_23]: I thank Councilor Lungo-Koehn for bringing up this important issue.

513
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:29,154
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe it was about maybe eight years ago that we had a number of these concerns that were coming before the council.

514
00:38:29,194 --> 00:38:33,395
[SPEAKER_23]: And at the time, the council president was Bob Mayarco.

515
00:38:34,176 --> 00:38:37,097
[SPEAKER_23]: And Bob Mayarco made it, it wasn't a council rule,

516
00:38:37,492 --> 00:38:43,894
[SPEAKER_23]: But he made it a rule through the president that any expenditure or loan order had to go to a committee of the whole meeting first.

517
00:38:44,594 --> 00:38:51,635
[SPEAKER_23]: And that forced the hand of the administration to provide documentation to the council at a committee of the whole meeting.

518
00:38:52,215 --> 00:39:02,758
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think what's happening now is that that process has been circumvented, and the mayor is getting these particular resolves right on the council agenda, trying to put

519
00:39:03,154 --> 00:39:08,717
[SPEAKER_23]: heat on, because, you know, let's face it, many of the issues are very important issues.

520
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:11,439
[SPEAKER_23]: We had the issue with the drainage at Winthrop Circle.

521
00:39:11,779 --> 00:39:15,941
[SPEAKER_23]: We had the issue with the fire stations that came up not too long ago and so forth.

522
00:39:16,302 --> 00:39:20,644
[SPEAKER_23]: There are many important issues that are out there that we do need loan orders and expenditures.

523
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:24,186
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't think anyone behind this really is doubting that.

524
00:39:24,647 --> 00:39:30,430
[SPEAKER_23]: But the fact that we're unable to get any type of supporting documentation,

525
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,091
[SPEAKER_23]: any type of feedback.

526
00:39:32,531 --> 00:39:40,194
[SPEAKER_23]: I did receive a call last week before this was on the agenda from the mayor's office asking to speak with me.

527
00:39:41,014 --> 00:39:48,777
[SPEAKER_23]: That probably happens maybe once a year that I get a call, and I knew what it was regarding, but I'll be quite frank.

528
00:39:49,558 --> 00:39:51,738
[SPEAKER_23]: I refuse to do business over the phone.

529
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:56,020
[SPEAKER_23]: I refuse to do business without having supporting documentation.

530
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,182
[SPEAKER_23]: I refuse to do business, as the gentleman just got up,

531
00:40:00,557 --> 00:40:03,199
[SPEAKER_23]: microgerial where there's no transparency.

532
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:16,790
[SPEAKER_23]: And to me, not to have written detail on the agenda, which is really the only public document available, and to do things over a phone call is not how I think government should be operated in this day and age.

533
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,472
[SPEAKER_23]: So I support this wholeheartedly.

534
00:40:19,873 --> 00:40:29,060
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that we could accomplish the same goal if the current president of the council chose not to allow these papers to come right before the council for a vote.

535
00:40:29,514 --> 00:40:39,883
[SPEAKER_23]: but to send them to a Committee of the Whole meeting so we can vet out the issues, we can ask our questions, and have the proper information presented to us in a timely fashion.

536
00:40:39,923 --> 00:40:41,304
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I support this.

537
00:40:41,344 --> 00:40:46,009
[SPEAKER_23]: Whatever the avenue or the mechanism is to get to this, I think we could do it a number of different ways.

538
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:56,698
[SPEAKER_23]: But I would ask, Mr. President, with all due respect, that you be the gatekeeper on these issues and tell the administration

539
00:40:57,037 --> 00:41:07,450
[SPEAKER_23]: No, we're not going to put this on the agenda for a council vote until it's vetted out, until we have the full language asking what needs to be done, and then we'll review it at the appropriate time.

540
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:13,357
[SPEAKER_23]: So, I would ask that this lay in the hands of the council president, under your authority, Mr. President.

541
00:41:20,409 --> 00:41:20,629
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

542
00:41:21,149 --> 00:41:22,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Please state your name and address for the record.

543
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:23,470
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

544
00:41:23,611 --> 00:41:26,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

545
00:41:26,992 --> 00:41:36,056
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank Councilor Michael Marks for stating that he wants written documentation because I've filed public records request after public records request.

546
00:41:36,697 --> 00:41:39,498
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes I hear no document on file.

547
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:45,501
[SPEAKER_06]: When the mayor met with a 501c3 at two pizza parlors, there were no documents on file.

548
00:41:46,121 --> 00:41:48,302
[SPEAKER_06]: We really need to have everything documented.

549
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:55,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people notice in the newspaper public records laws in Massachusetts are the weakest in the nation.

550
00:41:56,085 --> 00:41:58,526
[SPEAKER_06]: We, the citizens, need to have that documentation.

551
00:41:58,546 --> 00:41:59,686
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Councilor Marks.

552
00:41:59,926 --> 00:42:00,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Very, very important.

553
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:07,748
[SPEAKER_20]: If I could, just through the chair.

554
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:08,308
[SPEAKER_20]: Please.

555
00:42:08,908 --> 00:42:10,228
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree with Councilor Knight, too.

556
00:42:10,248 --> 00:42:12,609
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we should talk about it in rules and make it a

557
00:42:13,355 --> 00:42:14,335
[SPEAKER_20]: on paper change.

558
00:42:14,696 --> 00:42:16,296
[SPEAKER_20]: Rule 20 can only take you so far.

559
00:42:16,316 --> 00:42:17,757
[SPEAKER_20]: It can only get you that extra week.

560
00:42:17,857 --> 00:42:21,698
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't guarantee you'll get documentation from anybody.

561
00:42:21,718 --> 00:42:28,380
[SPEAKER_20]: It just tables it for one week, just like we tabled it last week, and we still have no information before us tonight on those $800,000 bond requests.

562
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:28,740
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would

563
00:42:33,306 --> 00:42:37,949
[SPEAKER_20]: I would suggest that we do send that portion of the rules committee, but I also would like the council to vote on it.

564
00:42:38,189 --> 00:42:42,051
[SPEAKER_20]: Just send a message that we'd like, um, just an explanation writing.

565
00:42:42,151 --> 00:42:51,536
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would amend it to put a written detailed itemized explanation if we could just a written detailed itemized explanation.

566
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:56,539
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you for that of such expenditure at least seven days prior to said vote.

567
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,803
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree with my colleagues and I hope we stick together and just, just for the, you know, so we can get some, um,

568
00:43:03,538 --> 00:43:06,641
[SPEAKER_20]: facts in front of us before we discuss it with the department heads.

569
00:43:06,761 --> 00:43:07,661
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's important.

570
00:43:08,422 --> 00:43:16,869
[SPEAKER_20]: And then just, I do too believe it should be online with regards to the taxpayers can see, you know, the same information we see.

571
00:43:16,889 --> 00:43:20,452
[SPEAKER_20]: And with regards to the water rates, I didn't hear a 15% increase.

572
00:43:20,592 --> 00:43:24,335
[SPEAKER_20]: So just make sure before we go throwing that online, definitely check those numbers.

573
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:26,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Very good.

574
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,271
[SPEAKER_13]: So Councilor, you're amending your motion, your motion.

575
00:43:30,092 --> 00:43:32,433
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight, are you withdrawing yours?

576
00:43:32,573 --> 00:43:38,516
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Mr. President, we have an a paper and a B paper and a paper to address the rest of this preceding term.

577
00:43:38,656 --> 00:43:42,218
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we will have a meeting of the rules committee to establish the rule.

578
00:43:42,618 --> 00:43:46,159
[SPEAKER_09]: If we look at our rules right now, we have a section 22 rule 22.

579
00:43:46,259 --> 00:43:47,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, not section 22.

580
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to confuse the two, but rule 22 says,

581
00:43:50,218 --> 00:43:59,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Every ordinance and every order for a bond issued shall, before its passage, be referred to the solicitor, who shall forthwith examine the same as to its legality and notify the council in writing of his or her findings.

582
00:43:59,863 --> 00:44:05,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And we'll see on every bond request that we receive and every expenditure request that we receive, we have a cover letter from the city solicitor.

583
00:44:05,485 --> 00:44:08,147
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's been pretty effective, and we receive that every time, Mr. President.

584
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:10,808
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that this is actually, you know,

585
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,602
[SPEAKER_09]: us working together to come up with a great venue and a great way to handle this.

586
00:44:16,622 --> 00:44:22,924
[SPEAKER_09]: We can handle the rest of this term through Councilor Longo's resolution, and we'll put it on the Rules Committee to address it for the future.

587
00:44:23,144 --> 00:44:24,004
[SPEAKER_09]: When the new Council comes in.

588
00:44:24,024 --> 00:44:24,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

589
00:44:24,865 --> 00:44:27,786
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the B paper to send the issue to the Rules Committee.

590

[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

593
00:44:31,347 --> 00:44:38,189
[SPEAKER_16]: And on the A paper as amended by Councilor Longo-Curran, a roll call has been requested.

594
00:44:38,229 --> 00:44:40,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, if you would please call the roll.

595
00:44:41,792 --> 00:44:43,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you need to speak on this motion before we call the roll?

596
00:44:44,154 --> 00:44:44,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor?

597

632
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:20,498
[SPEAKER_04]: The chair recognizes councilor Caraviello for recommendation.

633
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:23,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, are you taking over the, the variety store that's already there?

634
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,220
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, sir.

635
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:24,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

636
00:46:25,161 --> 00:46:30,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Mr. President, I find their papers in order and a motion for approval on the motion for approval by councilor.

637
00:46:30,944 --> 00:46:33,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, care of yellow council, Camuso.

638
00:46:34,265 --> 00:46:34,745
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, nope.

639
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:39,648
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have one another thing on the suspension and when he's done with his very good, uh, Councilor Knight.

640
00:46:40,114 --> 00:46:44,717
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I am in support of the convictual's license for these individuals.

641
00:46:44,757 --> 00:46:46,058
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I do have a request of them.

642
00:46:46,918 --> 00:46:56,545
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a pet peeve when I drive down Central and I drive past Pease Variety, and when the store is open, they still have the security grates down, covered with graffiti on the Spring Street side, Mr. President.

643
00:46:57,145 --> 00:47:08,032
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd ask that while you guys are in operation and in business and the store is open, that the security grates be opened during operating hours, because it really is a blight to the neighborhood to see the security grates down.

644
00:47:08,482 --> 00:47:11,123
[SPEAKER_08]: all day long with just the door open and maybe one window.

645
00:47:11,903 --> 00:47:15,524
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the thing is that we just provide a couple of more security systems.

646
00:47:15,564 --> 00:47:26,427
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, we didn't have any CC camera outside, but right now we add up two more cameras, which one you can view from inside the roadside view as well.

647
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:33,309
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be like all the cameras was inside, but recently we add up two other cameras, which one you can see, like,

648
00:47:33,709 --> 00:47:39,014
[SPEAKER_00]: record it or everything from outside, whatever, coming into your store or anything.

649
00:47:39,034 --> 00:47:42,837
[SPEAKER_09]: So don't get me wrong, Mr. President, I certainly respect their right to protect their asset.

650
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:47,681
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I think during normal operating hours when somebody is in there, the grates could be lifted.

651
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:53,386
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd also ask that a correspondence be sent to the convenience store on the corner of Fulton and Salem Street, asking the same.

652
00:47:54,047 --> 00:48:00,372
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, or the amend, on the motion of Councilor Caraviello for approval as amended by Councilor Knight,

653
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:04,664
[SPEAKER_16]: with that communique to be sent to Fulton Street through the clerk's office.

654
00:48:05,564 --> 00:48:06,325
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

655
00:48:06,725 --> 00:48:06,825
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

656
00:48:07,265 --> 00:48:07,805
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

657
00:48:07,825 --> 00:48:08,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Congratulations.

658
00:48:09,165 --> 00:48:09,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, sir.

659
00:48:09,645 --> 00:48:09,926
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, sir.

660
00:48:09,946 --> 00:48:10,246

[SPEAKER_16]: Please tell us your hours of operation.

691
00:49:40,688 --> 00:49:44,191
[SPEAKER_16]: When you intend to be open, from what time in the morning to what time in the evening?

692
00:49:44,572 --> 00:49:45,212
[SPEAKER_22]: From 6 to 8.

693
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:50,458
[SPEAKER_22]: 6 a.m.

694
00:49:50,478 --> 00:49:51,459
[SPEAKER_22]: 6 a.m.

695
00:49:51,579 --> 00:49:52,320
[SPEAKER_22]: to 8 p.m.

696
00:49:55,682 --> 00:49:59,885
[SPEAKER_16]: As I review the regulation to be opened at 7, are they not, Mr. Clark?

697
00:49:59,985 --> 00:49:59,885
7?

698
00:50:00,005 --> 00:50:03,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me see if I have a special permit.

699
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:17,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Are you going to be open just to bake at 6 in the morning, or are you open to sell?

700
00:50:19,636 --> 00:50:21,557
[SPEAKER_22]: The vehicle right now is stay open.

701
00:50:21,817 --> 00:50:24,599
[SPEAKER_22]: I just changed the order.

702
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:31,022
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, the open is 6 AM to 8 AM.

703
00:50:31,343 --> 00:50:31,643
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

704
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:34,044
[SPEAKER_15]: That requires a special permit.

705
00:50:34,204 --> 00:50:39,787
[SPEAKER_10]: If he's going to be open for retail at 6 o'clock, he might have to sit there.

706
00:50:40,828 --> 00:50:47,852
[SPEAKER_16]: If you are going to open at 6 o'clock for retail to sell, you have to come back to us for a special permit.

707
00:50:48,577 --> 00:50:51,224
[SPEAKER_16]: So you have to go to the clerk's office to start that process.

708
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:54,893
[SPEAKER_16]: If it's your intention to open from seven to 10 PM.

709
00:50:56,828 --> 00:51:05,375
[SPEAKER_16]: then any retailer has the opportunity to work within those hours, unless there's a previous... What number is this?

710
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:05,375
295?

711
00:51:05,515 --> 00:51:10,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, no, they have Monday to Sunday, 5.30 a.m.

712
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,081
[SPEAKER_16]: It's tied to the location?

713
00:51:13,101 --> 00:51:13,341
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

714
00:51:13,982 --> 00:51:18,265
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's tied to the location, so you may... So you do not need a special permit.

715
00:51:18,345 --> 00:51:19,286
[SPEAKER_09]: Move for approval, Mr. President.

716
00:51:19,526 --> 00:51:21,488
[SPEAKER_16]: So on motion approval, all those in favor?

717
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:22,874
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed.

718
00:51:22,894 --> 00:51:23,234
[SPEAKER_16]: Good luck.

719
00:51:23,574 --> 00:51:23,874
[SPEAKER_16]: Good luck.

720
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:27,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

721
00:51:27,958 --> 00:51:28,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

722
00:51:29,139 --> 00:51:35,864
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're under suspension, we have a taxpayer and my friend, Mr. Jack Coakley, that would like to address this honorable body.

723
00:51:38,366 --> 00:51:39,527
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, Mr. Coakley.

724
00:51:39,587 --> 00:51:41,208
[SPEAKER_17]: Please state your name and address for the record.

725
00:51:41,709 --> 00:51:43,590
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Jack Coakley, 69 Gawley Road.

726
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:51,256
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to start by saying a couple of months ago, I saw the guys out in the street drawing lines.

727
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:53,482
[SPEAKER_17]: make an hour's warm-out.

728
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,925
[SPEAKER_17]: So I approached them, and they said, yeah, we're putting new gas lines.

729
00:51:57,805 --> 00:51:58,346
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, oh, great.

730
00:51:58,386 --> 00:52:00,227
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought about converting to gas.

731
00:52:00,247 --> 00:52:04,431
[SPEAKER_17]: So the guy was actually very, I think he was a city worker.

732
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:05,472
[SPEAKER_17]: And he was very helpful.

733
00:52:05,492 --> 00:52:14,399
[SPEAKER_17]: And he said, well, if you are hooked up to the main, it shouldn't be a problem if you want to convert to gas or if you want to bring gas in your house.

734
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:18,202
[SPEAKER_17]: He then left a note and said, I'm sorry, you were cut off in 2002 or something.

735
00:52:18,242 --> 00:52:21,485
[SPEAKER_17]: So I since found out, by the way, it's illegal

736
00:52:22,621 --> 00:52:27,785
[SPEAKER_17]: to not — like, in other words, they're trying to charge people who aren't on gas, so the National Grid does their dit.

737
00:52:28,065 --> 00:52:30,847
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's actually illegal not to put in a brand-new gas line.

738
00:52:31,187 --> 00:52:32,628
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a customer — I sell trucks for a living.

739
00:52:32,648 --> 00:52:34,489
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a customer who puts these in.

740
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:38,492
[SPEAKER_17]: It's actually against the law not to put in the new plastic PVC pipes.

741
00:52:39,093 --> 00:52:46,017
[SPEAKER_17]: So the fact that I was hooked up has nothing to do with it because they're under legal obligation to put in a new pipe.

742
00:52:46,638 --> 00:52:49,180
[SPEAKER_17]: So, really, they're just taking advantage of people.

743
00:52:50,093 --> 00:52:50,653
[SPEAKER_17]: taking their money.

744
00:52:50,873 --> 00:52:52,614
[SPEAKER_17]: So basically they're stealing, in my opinion.

745
00:52:53,275 --> 00:52:57,877
[SPEAKER_17]: So I figured I'd take care of that when they, because they drew the lines like three months ago.

746
00:52:57,897 --> 00:53:00,578
[SPEAKER_17]: I figured I'd take care of that when the time came and fight it out.

747
00:53:00,618 --> 00:53:00,778
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

748
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:04,440
[SPEAKER_17]: So the guy was, like I said, he was nice about it.

749
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:12,884
[SPEAKER_17]: So this morning, uh, my wife called me a little frantic and, uh, she said, you're not going to believe what, uh, what just happened.

750
00:53:12,944 --> 00:53:13,585
[SPEAKER_17]: And I said, what happened?

751
00:53:13,605 --> 00:53:18,107
[SPEAKER_17]: She said, uh, I came home, uh, from walking the dog and, uh,

752
00:53:18,721 --> 00:53:19,521
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw the sign.

753
00:53:19,581 --> 00:53:21,302
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not very clear, but I'll pass it on to Paul.

754
00:53:21,682 --> 00:53:22,422
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks pretty official.

755
00:53:22,462 --> 00:53:33,105
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if it was put there by the city or if it was put there by the contractor, but a sign clearly says no parking.

756
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:37,727
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want me to read the sign so people, you can, I can, yeah, it says, uh, I can say what it says.

757
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:44,085
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not that bright, but maybe a little brighter, maybe, maybe a little brighter than the engineers for the city, but not that bright.

758
00:53:44,685 --> 00:53:54,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so, uh, it says, uh, no parking tow zone, uh, from seven to four, seven to four or five.

759
00:53:54,734 --> 00:53:55,694
[SPEAKER_17]: It says five.

760
00:53:55,794 --> 00:53:56,075
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yeah.

761
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:58,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that sign says some of them say four different ones.

762
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:06,163
[SPEAKER_17]: There's different signs all over the, uh, sidewalks, Mike and, uh, uh, Monday through Saturday, effective 1130.

763
00:54:08,762 --> 00:54:10,063
[SPEAKER_17]: through December 28th.

764
00:54:12,886 --> 00:54:20,872
[SPEAKER_17]: So when I called City, my wife was frantic, so I called the DPW, and I got a very nice woman, actually, who was very, not very helpful, but tried to be.

765
00:54:21,833 --> 00:54:29,480
[SPEAKER_17]: And she said, well, the money's been approved, it's been, I said, well, what do you want me to do with my cars?

766
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,343
[SPEAKER_17]: Would you like me to put them in my living room, or, you know, where do you want me to put them?

767
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:35,024
[SPEAKER_17]: And she said,

768
00:54:36,433 --> 00:54:36,953
[SPEAKER_17]: But we don't know.

769
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:44,056
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, well, did anybody think of possibly, because you know, they were doing this when it was warm out.

770
00:54:45,197 --> 00:54:51,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Did anybody think of maybe saying to the residents, this is going to affect the whole of Corley road and all of twice circle.

771
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,500
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, that's on this next.

772
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:02,484
[SPEAKER_17]: Did anybody think about saying, Hey, maybe we should get together and get a little community input here and figure out maybe some solutions.

773
00:55:02,764 --> 00:55:05,285
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we could have called tops, maybe a little late to that now.

774
00:55:05,701 --> 00:55:07,121
[SPEAKER_17]: see if they had some parking for us.

775
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:13,222
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we could have, I suggested to her, I said, well, why don't we take down the fence or open up the gate at Barry Park?

776
00:55:13,242 --> 00:55:15,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we can put something down so it's not so soft.

777
00:55:15,503 --> 00:55:17,083
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we can put cars in Barry Park.

778
00:55:17,703 --> 00:55:19,243
[SPEAKER_17]: She goes, well, I don't know if we can do that.

779
00:55:19,663 --> 00:55:21,084
[SPEAKER_17]: I said, well, we only have six days.

780
00:55:22,144 --> 00:55:25,404
[SPEAKER_17]: But you know, if we'd had a meeting at the library or something, maybe we could have figured something out.

781
00:55:26,625 --> 00:55:27,585
[SPEAKER_17]: And what about the old people?

782
00:55:28,865 --> 00:55:29,645
[SPEAKER_17]: What are they going to do?

783
00:55:30,505 --> 00:55:31,566
[SPEAKER_17]: How are they going to get to their house?

784
00:55:32,366 --> 00:55:33,866
[SPEAKER_17]: It states here in the letter, by the way,

785
00:55:34,852 --> 00:55:36,533
[SPEAKER_17]: This is a pretty, now I'll pass this back.

786
00:55:36,593 --> 00:55:38,094
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like it back, but if you want my copies.

787
00:55:39,615 --> 00:55:41,256
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm picking some stuff out here.

788
00:55:44,838 --> 00:55:47,060
[SPEAKER_17]: Will I be able to park on the street during this construction?

789
00:55:47,080 --> 00:56:03,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Restriction notifications posted throughout the, well clearly no notify residents, but I'm trying to, there's one here that says, somewhere in here, and it's in these two things, you may not have access for certain periods of time to your home.

790
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:09,639
[SPEAKER_17]: And we will try to limit that as much as we can.

791
00:56:10,939 --> 00:56:31,727
[SPEAKER_17]: So when 75-year-old said resident walks up with her bundle of groceries from George Street in the snow when it's 20 below zero, when they were drawing the lines in like August, we're going to tell her, sorry, Grandma, go back to George Street.

792
00:56:32,047 --> 00:56:33,868
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not ready to let you have access to your house.

793
00:56:36,128 --> 00:56:40,732
[SPEAKER_17]: And if anybody forgot, it's Christmas.

794
00:56:42,574 --> 00:56:50,602
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't go on Black Friday and go to Amazon.com and order anything because they can't deliver packages to my house.

795
00:56:54,025 --> 00:56:56,047
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can't order anything online for Christmas.

796
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:01,592
[SPEAKER_17]: It just kind of sort of dumbfounds me that

797
00:57:03,277 --> 00:57:03,897
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's right here.

798
00:57:03,977 --> 00:57:04,638
[SPEAKER_17]: I need a copy of it.

799
00:57:04,658 --> 00:57:05,939
[SPEAKER_17]: These are the two letters we received today.

800
00:57:06,379 --> 00:57:13,784
[SPEAKER_17]: So it just sort of dumb farms me that, uh, I don't want to use the word stupid, but maybe negligent.

801
00:57:14,385 --> 00:57:20,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's use negligent that the city could actually be that negligent and to somehow think that this is okay.

802
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there really anybody here that thinks it's okay?

803
00:57:23,631 --> 00:57:24,272
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just asking.

804
00:57:24,292 --> 00:57:28,055
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I don't, I don't want to come off like a jerk.

805
00:57:28,195 --> 00:57:32,718
[SPEAKER_17]: Look, if we got gas leaks in the street and that's what the answer was from the woman at the DPW,

806
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:37,008
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm a resident, we have to fix the gas leaks in the street.

807
00:57:38,069 --> 00:57:40,350
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it inconvenience in me when I'd rather it inconvenience somebody else?

808
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:40,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, of course.

809
00:57:41,370 --> 00:57:44,812
[SPEAKER_17]: But the fact is, if the gas leaks are in front of my house, they have to be fixed and I understand that.

810
00:57:45,692 --> 00:57:47,853
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm not an unreasonable person.

811
00:57:49,014 --> 00:57:53,696
[SPEAKER_17]: But I do think that there should have been some kind of communication, some kind of better thought out planning.

812
00:57:54,236 --> 00:58:02,580
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey, it's Christmas, this is probably not a good time to rip the street up and tell everybody to put their cars somewhere else.

813
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,777
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, that's kind of more my thought.

814
00:58:08,058 --> 00:58:11,479
[SPEAKER_17]: Like I said, when I asked her about the park, I said, you know, can we push the fences down?

815
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:12,519
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we use the tennis courts?

816
00:58:12,539 --> 00:58:12,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we?

817
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,300
[SPEAKER_17]: She was a nice person.

818
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,701
[SPEAKER_17]: She was trying very hard to help me.

819
00:58:15,741 --> 00:58:17,962
[SPEAKER_17]: She tried to get George on the phone, whoever George is.

820
00:58:18,002 --> 00:58:19,923
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know who that is.

821
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:22,704
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, I got to find George.

822
00:58:22,744 --> 00:58:24,145
[SPEAKER_17]: I got to find George, whoever George is.

823
00:58:24,165 --> 00:58:25,885
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm like, okay, I'll hold, you know.

824
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,727
[SPEAKER_17]: So, like I said, she was really trying.

825
00:58:28,787 --> 00:58:30,407
[SPEAKER_17]: She spent 20 minutes on the phone with me.

826
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:31,808
[SPEAKER_17]: I had her name written down.

827
00:58:31,828 --> 00:58:32,488
[SPEAKER_17]: It's in my office.

828
00:58:32,728 --> 00:58:33,389
[SPEAKER_17]: She really did try.

829
00:58:35,482 --> 00:58:39,805
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, the fact is, I'm just wondering, is there any intelligent life over the DPW?

830
00:58:39,825 --> 00:58:51,333
[SPEAKER_17]: They got a nice brand new building and you know, as the sun shining through there, I mean, I just, you know, because we, I mean me personally, I want the new street, I want the gas line, you know?

831
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:55,736
[SPEAKER_17]: So my question to you is, you know, can we have multiple city councilors?

832
00:58:55,796 --> 00:59:03,122
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm looking for everybody find out a, who's the negligent person that dreamed this up and B,

833
00:59:04,678 --> 00:59:10,780
[SPEAKER_17]: Can they, are they bright enough to figure out maybe some solutions and some, you know, to figure out how to make this a little smoother?

834
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:14,482
[SPEAKER_17]: And can it be delayed?

835
00:59:15,002 --> 00:59:18,503
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, probably not, because it's only going to get worse as time goes on.

836
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:28,907
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm also going to mention that this plays into, Paul knows, and I think Bobby knows, I fell off my roof last year.

837
00:59:30,092 --> 00:59:33,395
[SPEAKER_17]: My lovely daughter, who's here with me tonight, was taking me to a medical appointment.

838
00:59:33,915 --> 00:59:39,539
[SPEAKER_17]: My car was in front of my house for about a minute and a half, and she was helping me get out of the house because I was on crutches.

839
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:51,929
[SPEAKER_17]: And I ended up with a $50 apartment gift, you know, because they were driving around in their Escort, you know, trying to tag people during the, you know, great snowstorms of last year.

840
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:59,655
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm probably going in January to have, from that same injury, to have bone fusion surgery on my foot.

841
01:00:00,636 --> 01:00:02,137
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to be in a cast for three months.

842
01:00:03,398 --> 01:00:11,544
[SPEAKER_17]: I kind of don't want to be coming down goalie road from the dame school on the hill in my nice school, you know, in the ice trying to get in the house.

843
01:00:13,545 --> 01:00:19,769
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I guess my point is, did anybody think it would be a better time when it was warmer?

844
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:29,136
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, if you read that letter, I actually don't, as I said in the beginning of this conversation, and this is my last part of it, I happen to not be a national grid gas customer.

845
01:00:29,566 --> 01:00:32,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, I am a National Grid electric customer, right, with their rates.

846
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:38,010
[SPEAKER_17]: But it says in that letter, they're going to disconnect people.

847
01:00:39,191 --> 01:00:42,472
[SPEAKER_17]: And it also says, it's going to be possibly for days.

848
01:00:44,793 --> 01:00:45,974
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's going to be old people.

849
01:00:46,014 --> 01:00:46,794
[SPEAKER_17]: I got a wood stove.

850
01:00:47,094 --> 01:00:48,615
[SPEAKER_17]: If they disconnected me, I got a wood stove.

851
01:00:48,655 --> 01:00:49,255
[SPEAKER_17]: I could stay warm.

852
01:00:49,275 --> 01:00:53,738
[SPEAKER_17]: But there could be some 90-year-old woman on the street with no heat for two or three days.

853
01:00:53,978 --> 01:00:58,400
[SPEAKER_17]: In case somebody forgot to tell the geniuses at National Grid in the nice, big, beautiful building

854
01:00:59,243 --> 01:00:59,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

855
01:00:59,943 --> 01:01:01,804
[SPEAKER_17]: It gets kind of cold in December sometimes.

856
01:01:02,164 --> 01:01:09,248
[SPEAKER_17]: If you remember last December, it was a little cold and you're going to shut the heat off for two, three, four days.

857
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:12,970
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, who thought this up?

858
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,591
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just, I mean, like I said, I'm not really that smart.

859
01:01:15,611 --> 01:01:24,335
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't go to, you know, I went to five different high schools and I just kind of looked at it and went, you know, I mean, I just, I just hope that the people we have employed are a little smarter than me.

860
01:01:27,096 --> 01:01:30,677
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, I just — you know, I would like somebody — Paul has my cell phone.

861
01:01:30,697 --> 01:01:31,458
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll give it to anybody else.

862
01:01:31,758 --> 01:01:34,059
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like somebody to get back to me with some answers so we can do something.

863
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:34,659
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

864
01:01:34,679 --> 01:01:37,580
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I don't know if you guys think the PAC is crazy, if that's a crazy idea or something.

865
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,240
[SPEAKER_17]: So — Mr. President.

866
01:01:39,341 --> 01:01:40,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

867
01:01:40,201 --> 01:01:41,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Camuso.

868
01:01:42,002 --> 01:01:43,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

869
01:01:44,082 --> 01:01:48,544
[SPEAKER_07]: And, Jack, I certainly understand your frustration, as I indicated on the telephone earlier today.

870
01:01:49,765 --> 01:01:55,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe there's a timeline that National Grid is supposed to stop digging unless it's for emergency situations.

871
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:59,664
[SPEAKER_07]: And I thought it was around November 1st or October.

872
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:09,650
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could find out, first of all, who this gentleman George is, and secondly, once we do find out if a permit was issued.

873
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:19,776
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't want to sit here and say we should put the whole project on hold, because I don't know if there's people on that street that are waiting for gas, for if there's leaks.

874
01:02:19,876 --> 01:02:20,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know the circumstances.

875
01:02:21,417 --> 01:02:24,059
[SPEAKER_07]: But to not notify the neighborhood well in advance,

876
01:02:24,735 --> 01:02:27,217
[SPEAKER_07]: well in advance and come up with some sort of a solution.

877
01:02:28,098 --> 01:02:30,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, it's, it's mind boggling.

878
01:02:31,241 --> 01:02:51,159
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the other thing I'd like to mention, I think the least national grid can do, I feel probably they should give us all of us a year of free gas, but I'll put, you know, but they could at least put the gas in for nothing to try to charge us a couple of grand to bring the gas in after kicking us out of our house and tell us we can't order

879
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:56,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Christmas presents online, the least they can do is bring the gas in for nothing to try to charge us.

880
01:02:56,934 --> 01:03:00,616
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, really, that's just a little out of control, in my opinion.

881
01:03:01,557 --> 01:03:03,958
[SPEAKER_17]: So if you want to try for the year, we're free gas ball.

882
01:03:05,820 --> 01:03:05,980
[SPEAKER_17]: Good.

883
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm coming over your house for the winter then.

884
01:03:08,502 --> 01:03:08,902
[SPEAKER_07]: No lie.

885
01:03:08,922 --> 01:03:12,084
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could find out at least like, like you say, the city of Medford has control over.

886
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:17,418
[SPEAKER_07]: the permitting and as far as giving them the permission to do it.

887
01:03:17,739 --> 01:03:25,164
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could find out the circumstances surrounding it and we can get back to Jack tomorrow because he needs to let his neighbors know.

888
01:03:25,204 --> 01:03:28,206
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there's other people in the neighborhood that are concerned about this.

889
01:03:28,726 --> 01:03:38,093
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some senior citizens that live on Dwyer and in Gordley that depend on the sidewalks and the infrastructure in that immediate area.

890
01:03:38,613 --> 01:03:41,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just, I wish there was more communication.

891
01:03:41,634 --> 01:03:48,159
[SPEAKER_07]: And it wasn't at four o'clock this afternoon, or earlier in the afternoon when Mrs. Coakley brought it to his attention.

892
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:51,761
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we could just get the answers and find out too.

893
01:03:51,981 --> 01:03:53,422
[SPEAKER_07]: From the engineering office?

894
01:03:53,522 --> 01:03:54,323
[SPEAKER_07]: From the engineering office.

895
01:03:54,343 --> 01:04:07,272
[SPEAKER_07]: And if this is some upgrade for the purpose of convenience, and it's not an emergency, and it's convenience, that we do put it off until the springtime when the nice weather.

896
01:04:07,292 --> 01:04:09,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the snow plows are going to be right behind.

897
01:04:09,073 --> 01:04:10,074
[SPEAKER_07]: They're already talking about snow.

898
01:04:10,696 --> 01:04:14,360
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's just going to create a problem after a problem after a problem.

899
01:04:14,740 --> 01:04:15,661
[SPEAKER_07]: They said gas leaks.

900
01:04:15,901 --> 01:04:17,703
[SPEAKER_07]: So if it is gas leaks, that's one thing.

901
01:04:17,743 --> 01:04:19,445
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if it's gas leaks, it's gas leaks.

902
01:04:19,505 --> 01:04:21,086
[SPEAKER_07]: We see the stories of houses blowing up.

903
01:04:21,146 --> 01:04:22,588
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to take care of it.

904
01:04:22,628 --> 01:04:25,531
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't put the fire department or the neighborhood people in danger.

905
01:04:25,831 --> 01:04:31,076
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it's not gas leaks, and it is just because they have 13 customers that want to sign up,

906
01:04:31,712 --> 01:04:32,753
[SPEAKER_07]: and start selling gas.

907
01:04:32,773 --> 01:04:34,174
[SPEAKER_17]: My point is, can we use the park?

908
01:04:34,214 --> 01:04:35,094
[SPEAKER_17]: Can we do something about it?

909
01:04:35,114 --> 01:04:36,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and that was my second point.

910
01:04:36,615 --> 01:04:38,737
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jack had a very good idea.

911
01:04:39,457 --> 01:04:41,358
[SPEAKER_07]: You got Barry Park down the corner.

912
01:04:41,618 --> 01:04:42,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

913
01:04:43,159 --> 01:04:46,221
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the new, I call it the new Dame Schools.

914
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:50,064
[SPEAKER_07]: The Walnut Hill Properties owns a property there.

915
01:04:50,444 --> 01:04:56,588
[SPEAKER_07]: If maybe they would give us a couple spots, do something to alleviate the neighborhood's concerns.

916
01:04:56,948 --> 01:04:58,749
[SPEAKER_07]: And last but not least, last but not least,

917
01:05:01,405 --> 01:05:13,090
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to think that between November and Christmas is not a good time to be ripping up a street that's going to last 30 days, other than an emergency situation with gas leaks.

918
01:05:13,150 --> 01:05:14,811
[SPEAKER_07]: But they knew about it two months before this.

919
01:05:15,231 --> 01:05:15,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

920
01:05:15,771 --> 01:05:22,514
[SPEAKER_17]: They did know about it because they were talking to me about it two or three months ago.

921
01:05:22,815 --> 01:05:27,117
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just saying a little planning might have said, geez, December's probably not a great time.

922
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:27,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

923
01:05:29,097 --> 01:05:35,159
[SPEAKER_07]: As you know, I talk to you quite frequently and I will, uh, be updating with you tomorrow with what we can find out.

924
01:05:35,179 --> 01:05:37,239
[SPEAKER_17]: I appreciate what you guys can find out.

925
01:05:37,659 --> 01:05:38,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

926
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:39,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Penta.

927
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:41,040
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

928
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:55,144
[SPEAKER_02]: And the paper that you have there, Jack, there's a question on the bottom of the line there that says, are there going to be any, I think restrictions as it relates to the parking and the second, they're going to make everything possible, but that's a city of Medford sign that's posted.

929
01:05:56,496 --> 01:05:59,818
[SPEAKER_02]: that says no parking from seven in the morning to five at night, whatever it might be.

930
01:06:00,598 --> 01:06:05,881
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm assuming that since they didn't come before the council to get the permit, I mean, where do they go?

931
01:06:05,901 --> 01:06:06,942
[SPEAKER_02]: The building department?

932
01:06:06,962 --> 01:06:07,522
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

933
01:06:07,722 --> 01:06:15,607
[SPEAKER_17]: It says that they were issued from the DPW.

934
01:06:16,087 --> 01:06:21,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they were issued from the DPW, I thought all permits that applied for would have to come before the council, Mr. Clark.

935
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:21,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true?

936
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:25,232
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, if you want a copy of the paper, it says through the DPW.

937
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:28,691
[SPEAKER_02]: There's stuff to come, you have to open up a street.

938
01:06:29,491 --> 01:06:32,433
[SPEAKER_02]: They're opening up a street for Digley, for Gasley, correct?

939
01:06:33,294 --> 01:06:37,676
[SPEAKER_02]: They're supposed to post a $10,000 bond as well.

940
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:45,701
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get that information tomorrow.

941
01:06:45,741 --> 01:06:48,603
[SPEAKER_13]: It says in here, but it definitely says it's through the DBW.

942
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:55,567
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll amend that if we could, Councilor, if it's all right to amend the paper to ask the city engineer to

943
01:06:56,195 --> 01:07:09,418
[SPEAKER_16]: explain the entire permitting process for this project, and why wasn't there sufficient notification and forethought put into this that the citizens are put in such dire straits.

944
01:07:09,438 --> 01:07:19,540
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, to imagine that people, whether they're old or young, may be without heat for four days in the middle of the winter is ridiculous.

945
01:07:24,738 --> 01:07:25,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

946
01:07:26,178 --> 01:07:27,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President.

947
01:07:27,398 --> 01:07:30,799
[SPEAKER_09]: I also find it confusing that they'd put the restrictions.

948
01:07:31,299 --> 01:07:31,839
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Coakley.

949
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:44,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Coakley.

950
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,542
[SPEAKER_09]: A quick question for you, sir.

951
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:51,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Were these signs posted the full length of Goley Road into ISR?

952
01:07:51,483 --> 01:07:53,523
[SPEAKER_17]: They're like on little horses, saw horses.

953
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,945
[SPEAKER_09]: But would it go from Summit Street to George?

954
01:07:56,786 --> 01:07:56,966
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

955
01:07:57,347 --> 01:07:58,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Summit Street to George?

956
01:07:58,067 --> 01:07:58,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Pretty much, yeah.

957
01:07:59,008 --> 01:08:00,370
[SPEAKER_17]: In a round, wide circle, too.

958
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:01,491
[SPEAKER_09]: In a round, wide circle as well.

959
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:11,261
[SPEAKER_09]: It says on this paper here that they're going from- The reason I ask is because I've never seen National Grid, first of all, work on a project after 3 o'clock in the afternoon, number one.

960
01:08:11,577 --> 01:08:13,759
[SPEAKER_09]: but they're restricting your parking till 5 o'clock in the afternoon.

961
01:08:13,799 --> 01:08:20,644
[SPEAKER_09]: And number two, I don't understand why, if in fact they are going to do the project for the whole entire street, why it's not done in segments as opposed to shutting the whole street down.

962
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:21,685
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that's kind of what I think.

963
01:08:21,705 --> 01:08:22,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, yeah, yeah.

964
01:08:22,025 --> 01:08:22,865
[SPEAKER_17]: That was what I thought, too.

965
01:08:22,885 --> 01:08:28,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, I can understand if they said to you, hey, can you, well, first of all, the tow zone thing is a little offensive, right?

966
01:08:28,109 --> 01:08:31,772
[SPEAKER_17]: But if they said, listen, you know, this day we're going to be working, can you come?

967
01:08:31,812 --> 01:08:36,476
[SPEAKER_17]: If we're coming, the crew's coming at 7, can I go out and take my daughter's car and my car and move it down the street?

968
01:08:37,192 --> 01:08:37,572
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

969
01:08:37,632 --> 01:08:43,033
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a little inconvenient, but you know, don't threaten that Derek Stevens is going to be there and you know, in three and a half minutes, you know what I mean?

970
01:08:43,453 --> 01:08:45,634
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just, I understand it has to be done.

971
01:08:47,134 --> 01:08:58,036
[SPEAKER_17]: It's extremely inconvenient, but I do think the second part of this, uh, Councilor Knight should be, why are they charging or trying to charge Medford residents for the connection?

972
01:08:58,597 --> 01:09:03,358
[SPEAKER_17]: When they have to put the new pipe in legally, they have no choice.

973
01:09:04,398 --> 01:09:05,578
[SPEAKER_17]: It's illegal for them not to.

974
01:09:06,795 --> 01:09:08,356
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm a hundred percent certain.

975
01:09:08,456 --> 01:09:09,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, I don't doubt it for one bit.

976
01:09:09,757 --> 01:09:10,438
[SPEAKER_08]: You did your homework.

977
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:11,179
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean?

978
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:12,600
[SPEAKER_08]: You see a lot of people come up here that don't.

979
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:13,721
[SPEAKER_17]: They can't use the steel pipe.

980
01:09:13,961 --> 01:09:14,762
[SPEAKER_17]: It's against the law.

981
01:09:15,402 --> 01:09:16,743
[SPEAKER_17]: They have to use PVC pipe.

982
01:09:17,344 --> 01:09:19,325
[SPEAKER_17]: So anybody who's in there, it has to be replaced.

983
01:09:19,746 --> 01:09:23,489
[SPEAKER_17]: So saying that you hooked up to the main has nothing to do with the put in the pipe.

984
01:09:23,589 --> 01:09:23,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing.

985
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:27,092
[SPEAKER_17]: And they're not allowed to go through the houses anymore from the foundation.

986
01:09:27,532 --> 01:09:28,092
[SPEAKER_17]: That's illegal.

987
01:09:28,112 --> 01:09:28,333
[SPEAKER_17]: Right.

988
01:09:30,354 --> 01:09:34,137
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion by council Penter as amended by Councilors, uh,

989
01:09:38,419 --> 01:09:40,521
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilors Penta and Knight.

990
01:09:41,121 --> 01:09:41,361
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

991
01:09:44,203 --> 01:09:58,274
[SPEAKER_09]: The matter that we're voting on right now would be to have the city engineer explain the process to us in the permitting process and the restrictions and why this is going to happen.

992
01:09:58,314 --> 01:09:58,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

993
01:09:58,575 --> 01:10:01,837
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're going to also have a couple of other side questions that the clerk has taken down.

994
01:10:02,197 --> 01:10:02,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

995
01:10:02,377 --> 01:10:05,440
[SPEAKER_14]: The main motion that we're voting on would be to have a meeting with the engineer.

996
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:07,541
[SPEAKER_14]: In a report back.

997
01:10:07,641 --> 01:10:08,201
[SPEAKER_14]: In a report back.

998
01:10:08,301 --> 01:10:08,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

999
01:10:08,681 --> 01:10:08,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Great.

1000
01:10:08,841 --> 01:10:09,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1001
01:10:09,822 --> 01:10:11,283
[SPEAKER_14]: So on that motion, all those in favor.

1002
01:10:11,623 --> 01:10:11,723
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1003
01:10:12,004 --> 01:10:13,525
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed.

1004
01:10:14,365 --> 01:10:14,806
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

1005
01:10:14,886 --> 01:10:15,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

1006
01:10:16,187 --> 01:10:17,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck with the surgery.

1007
01:10:17,107 --> 01:10:25,073
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Penta to revert back to the regular order of business.

1008
01:10:25,113 --> 01:10:25,773
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor.

1009
01:10:25,793 --> 01:10:28,735
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed.

1010
01:10:28,795 --> 01:10:29,116
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1011
01:10:29,136 --> 01:10:30,336
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-763 offered by Councilor Penta.

1012
01:10:30,777 --> 01:10:34,319
[SPEAKER_16]: Be resolved that the public safety concerns at Roosevelt Circle be concerned.

1013
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:35,380
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Penta.

1014
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:40,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, this is not the first time we've had to bring this up, and this seems to be an ongoing situation.

1015
01:10:41,024 --> 01:10:50,111
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're coming up the exit to Roosevelt Circle going south down Route 93, it's a combination of the lights being off, and then once you go halfway around the circle, the lights are off.

1016
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:54,014
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this was presented to Representative Donato before in the past.

1017
01:10:54,974 --> 01:10:58,077
[SPEAKER_02]: There was some concern about the state coming in there and doing it.

1018
01:10:59,037 --> 01:11:00,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, they still haven't found time to do it.

1019
01:11:01,019 --> 01:11:05,262
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a direct public safety hazard, especially for people going around that rotary.

1020
01:11:05,767 --> 01:11:10,369
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to take the right either to south border road or down to forest street in Medford.

1021
01:11:10,429 --> 01:11:11,690
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely dark over there.

1022
01:11:12,190 --> 01:11:15,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, the light's coming off the ramp and then on the opposite side of route.

1023
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:28,837
[SPEAKER_02]: So once again, I move that that be forwarded to the state department of public safety and have that forwarded to our representative, Mr. Donato, because we're supposed to have been taken care of and it's still not been addressed.

1024
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:32,332
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Penta for approval.

1025
01:11:32,352 --> 01:11:33,573
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

1026
01:11:34,133 --> 01:11:35,714
[SPEAKER_16]: Offered by Councilor Caraviello.

1027
01:11:36,855 --> 01:11:38,016
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call has been requested.

1028
01:11:38,056 --> 01:11:38,757
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

1029
01:11:38,917 --> 01:11:39,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1030
01:11:39,577 --> 01:11:40,758
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with Councilor Penta there.

1031
01:11:41,058 --> 01:11:45,022
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a light that's been knocked down for a couple of years now.

1032
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody must have knocked it down during an accident.

1033
01:11:48,424 --> 01:11:49,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's never been replaced.

1034
01:11:50,526 --> 01:11:51,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Light where?

1035
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:53,128
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a light pole right where he was talking about.

1036
01:11:53,168 --> 01:11:53,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1037
01:11:53,588 --> 01:11:58,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like maybe during an accident it got knocked down and all of a sudden there was a little piece that was left over.

1038
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:03,437
[SPEAKER_04]: If that light could be replaced, also.

1039
01:12:05,518 --> 01:12:09,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Right at that bus stop where he's talking about, there was a street light at one time.

1040
01:12:11,401 --> 01:12:15,203
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're coming off the exit from Route 93 south.

1041
01:12:15,283 --> 01:12:21,187
[SPEAKER_04]: It may have been knocked down by an accident or something, but all that's left there is a little piece of pole.

1042
01:12:24,498 --> 01:12:26,520
[SPEAKER_02]: take it on the right just before you take South border road.

1043
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:31,145
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a, there was a street light that was here, which is, which is kind of an odd spot for a bus stop anyways.

1044
01:12:33,347 --> 01:12:36,050
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it again, Eddie.

1045
01:12:36,430 --> 01:12:38,532
[SPEAKER_02]: What was your amendment?

1046
01:12:38,772 --> 01:12:44,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, to have representative Donato go back to the state department of public safety and put those lights back on.

1047
01:12:44,478 --> 01:12:48,001
[SPEAKER_02]: They were, this, this is months, this is running for months now that they haven't redressed them.

1048
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:59,216
[SPEAKER_02]: are on the road, not all of them are out, but the ones that are really significantly out are the ones that take you halfway around the rotary, that take you to South border road and to Forestry.

1049
01:13:01,898 --> 01:13:04,159
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion for approval, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1050
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:07,921
[SPEAKER_16]: As amended.

1051
01:13:10,082 --> 01:13:12,142
[SPEAKER_16]: As amended by Councilors Pinter and Caraviello.

1052
01:13:13,663 --> 01:13:14,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso.

1053
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:17,065
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello.

1054
01:13:17,145 --> 01:13:17,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1055
01:13:27,350 --> 01:13:27,650
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1056
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:35,396
[SPEAKER_16]: With the vote of five in the affirmative and two absent, the motion passes.

1057
01:13:35,416 --> 01:13:40,540
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-764 offered by Councilor Penta be it resolved that a mentoring program for youngsters be discussed.

1058
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:41,721
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Penta.

1059
01:13:41,901 --> 01:13:48,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, the amount of things that are happening today out there and with youngsters not having

1060
01:13:48,839 --> 01:13:51,341
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially youngsters that might be coming from a single-family home.

1061
01:13:52,682 --> 01:13:57,024
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just unfortunate that some of the programs that are offered are not being offered.

1062
01:13:58,045 --> 01:14:00,046
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be something that should be looked into.

1063
01:14:00,066 --> 01:14:15,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result of that, I think it would serve us well to look forward either in through the private sector, the non-profits, because we have a whole bunch of those that take place when we do our community block grant funding, or also in our public and private school.

1064
01:14:16,944 --> 01:14:22,785
[SPEAKER_02]: programs that are out there that can serve a purpose that can mentor youngsters at an early age.

1065
01:14:25,046 --> 01:14:27,166
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a wild bill that's out there right now.

1066
01:14:27,206 --> 01:14:28,027
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Senate bill.

1067
01:14:28,587 --> 01:14:29,267
[SPEAKER_02]: It passed the Senate.

1068
01:14:29,287 --> 01:14:30,387
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on its way to the House.

1069
01:14:30,467 --> 01:14:32,408
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm quite sure this might be brought up next week.

1070
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:42,930
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's sort of like it addresses, it calls itself age appropriate sexual content that's going to be mandated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1071
01:14:43,505 --> 01:14:46,767
[SPEAKER_02]: into our public school system for children 11 and 12 years of age.

1072
01:14:46,827 --> 01:15:09,362
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's causing quite a controversy and quite a stir as it relates to what is going to be considered to be age appropriate and what is age appropriate for the certain part of sexual connotations and sexual education and anything that revolves itself around a child's either awareness or lack of awareness as to where he or she might be going or understanding.

1073
01:15:09,947 --> 01:15:11,689
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the things I think that need to be addressed.

1074
01:15:11,709 --> 01:15:22,958
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's unfortunate when you have stuff like that, that they're trying to teach or educate you on, but they won't give you a civics class and make a mandated class to learn about your government, local, federal, and state.

1075
01:15:23,318 --> 01:15:31,165
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's kind of crazy in this day and age, especially, you know, you're trying to get people involved, and good government are having positions on government on issues.

1076
01:15:31,572 --> 01:15:56,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I don't know what mentoring program the city of Medford has or even offers, but I'd like to get a report back from either the superintendent of schools and any private school organization here in the city of Medford that might offer a mentoring program for youngsters, could be troubled youngsters, youngsters from single parent homes, or just youngsters in general that have become available here to the city.

1077
01:15:56,409 --> 01:15:58,190
[SPEAKER_13]: Where was the sexual component in this council?

1078
01:15:59,193 --> 01:16:00,114
[SPEAKER_02]: A mentoring program.

1079
01:16:00,154 --> 01:16:00,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Mentoring.

1080
01:16:00,754 --> 01:16:01,174
[SPEAKER_02]: Mentoring.

1081
01:16:02,555 --> 01:16:04,597
[SPEAKER_02]: M-E-N-T-O-R-I-N-G mentoring program.

1082
01:16:06,438 --> 01:16:09,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Sort of like a big brother, big sister, but it's something that's offered through education.

1083
01:16:11,081 --> 01:16:12,982
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have it and what is it and where is it?

1084
01:16:13,523 --> 01:16:17,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So that, uh, in what entity is to give us this report?

1085
01:16:18,226 --> 01:16:21,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, either the city, if the city has it, or if the school department has it.

1086
01:16:21,528 --> 01:16:21,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

1087
01:16:21,968 --> 01:16:27,512
[SPEAKER_16]: So if, uh, on the city side, Mr. Uh, clerk or the school department, uh, has a listing of,

1088
01:16:28,137 --> 01:16:40,182
[SPEAKER_16]: mentoring programs given by either within the public sector or by private educational entities in non-profits.

1089
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:42,463
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Panto.

1090
01:16:42,703 --> 01:16:44,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

1091
01:16:44,904 --> 01:16:45,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

1092
01:16:45,744 --> 01:16:46,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, ma'am.

1093
01:16:46,285 --> 01:16:46,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

1094
01:16:47,765 --> 01:16:48,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Lucia.

1095
01:16:49,306 --> 01:16:51,107
[SPEAKER_04]: What type of mentoring programs are you referring to?

1096
01:16:51,187 --> 01:16:52,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's just it.

1097
01:16:52,167 --> 01:16:52,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1098
01:16:53,107 --> 01:16:55,128
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they after school programs?

1099
01:16:55,288 --> 01:16:57,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they scholastic type of programs?

1100
01:16:57,459 --> 01:16:58,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they athletic programs?

1101
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:00,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they community awareness programs?

1102
01:17:01,141 --> 01:17:04,862
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a mentoring program that a kid gets after he's out of school.

1103
01:17:05,463 --> 01:17:07,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Or he might get it while he's in school.

1104
01:17:07,884 --> 01:17:11,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Specialized classes that relate to students that might have disabilities.

1105
01:17:11,866 --> 01:17:16,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they having special mentoring programs that can make the child adapt to life-like situations?

1106
01:17:16,268 --> 01:17:18,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, citizen.

1107
01:17:23,651 --> 01:17:25,232
[SPEAKER_16]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1108
01:17:25,472 --> 01:17:25,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome.

1109
01:17:26,234 --> 01:17:26,534
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi there.

1110
01:17:27,535 --> 01:17:29,716
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm Rachel Tannenhaus, 26 Pearl Street.

1111
01:17:31,176 --> 01:17:41,701
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd just like to recommend, since you happen to mention students with disabilities, I don't think it needs to be any kind of necessarily segregated program or class.

1112
01:17:41,721 --> 01:17:44,362
[SPEAKER_19]: Whoa, got some feedback going on there.

1113
01:17:44,823 --> 01:17:47,344
[SPEAKER_19]: Programs or classes or anything like that.

1114
01:17:47,424 --> 01:17:49,505
[SPEAKER_19]: But I do recommend as a possible resource.

1115
01:17:51,026 --> 01:17:53,987
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if you're familiar with the group Partners for Youth with Disabilities.

1116
01:17:54,921 --> 01:17:56,163
[SPEAKER_19]: They're an excellent program.

1117
01:17:56,704 --> 01:18:08,778
[SPEAKER_19]: They do mentoring programs and they are an excellent national resource around inclusive mentoring programs that do include youth with disabilities and I was going to suggest that

1118
01:18:09,707 --> 01:18:14,590
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to make the most inclusive possible program of whatever type, they're really good to contact.

1119
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:23,895
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think they also have some stuff on their website, which is www.PYD, as in Partners of Youth with Disabilities, .org.

1120
01:18:24,756 --> 01:18:29,538
[SPEAKER_19]: I am not affiliated with them, although I have been a mentor for a program that they're involved in.

1121
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:36,062
[SPEAKER_19]: But they're one of the premier resources out there on inclusive

1122
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:43,543
[SPEAKER_19]: mentoring programs, and I think that just calling them up and saying, hey, how can we make sure that everybody's included in this, and do you have any tips for us?

1123
01:18:44,524 --> 01:18:47,605
[SPEAKER_19]: They're really awesome people, and I definitely recommend it.

1124
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:56,790
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not entirely certain what that has to do with comprehensive sex education, but they probably have tips on providing inclusive sex education as well.

1125
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:59,271
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, if you want to throw that in there, you can.

1126
01:18:59,291 --> 01:19:02,413
[SPEAKER_19]: I think they'll be a little surprised, though.

1127
01:19:03,173 --> 01:19:03,953
[SPEAKER_19]: All right, thank you.

1128
01:19:04,254 --> 01:19:04,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Rachel.

1129
01:19:05,361 --> 01:19:06,501
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion of approval.

1130
01:19:07,502 --> 01:19:08,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Canvio.

1131
01:19:08,962 --> 01:19:15,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Through my own club, the Kiwanis Club, we have after school programs in the middle school, the high school, and all the way up to the college program.

1132
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:28,028
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a Builders Club, a Circle K Club, and a Key Club, which are all community-oriented things, and they're all after school, involving all types of students, fundraising, and community activities.

1133
01:19:28,568 --> 01:19:33,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, this year we incorporated Northeastern University as Circle Club, which

1134
01:19:34,278 --> 01:19:37,540
[SPEAKER_04]: College students are now involved with our program.

1135
01:19:38,141 --> 01:19:40,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's an after-school program for these kids to get involved with.

1136
01:19:41,403 --> 01:19:41,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

1137
01:19:41,903 --> 01:19:44,185
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Penter, all those in favor?

1138
01:19:44,505 --> 01:19:45,225
[SPEAKER_16]: One more thing, Rachel.

1139
01:19:45,245 --> 01:19:45,465
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

1140
01:19:45,826 --> 01:20:02,557
[SPEAKER_19]: Just to say quickly also that I have heard that there are some issues with transportation for students with disabilities who at some of the schools who want to participate in after-school activities, but there are some issues with getting them accessible transportation to

1141
01:20:03,472 --> 01:20:04,733
[SPEAKER_19]: help them be able to do that.

1142
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:14,740
[SPEAKER_19]: And so if that's one of the things you might want to look into, if you're looking at afterschool programs and making them inclusive, that all of the transportation policies make sure that everybody can participate.

1143
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:15,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

1144
01:20:18,423 --> 01:20:22,726
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Penta, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1145
01:20:24,227 --> 01:20:26,288
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Camuso?

1146
01:20:26,849 --> 01:20:27,069
Yes.

1147
01:20:27,409 --> 01:20:28,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello?

1148
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:28,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1149
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:29,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight?

1150
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:31,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Long and Kern?

1151
01:20:31,372 --> 01:20:31,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1152
01:20:32,293 --> 01:20:32,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks?

1153
01:20:34,637 --> 01:20:35,217
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Penta?

1154
01:20:35,257 --> 01:20:35,497
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1155
01:20:36,018 --> 01:20:36,798
[SPEAKER_11]: President Dello Russo?

1156
01:20:37,318 --> 01:20:37,599
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1157
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,880
[SPEAKER_16]: With a vote of six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

1158
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:48,404
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-765, offered by Councilor Penta, be it resolved that the city's street sweeping program be discussed.

1159
01:20:48,805 --> 01:20:49,525
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Councilor?

1160
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:55,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, most recently, the street sweeping program has taken off in a very inconsistent manner.

1161
01:20:56,789 --> 01:21:01,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks, when they're having their streets swept, have had their cars ticketed and towed.

1162
01:21:01,591 --> 01:21:04,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Other streets, cars have not been ticketed and towed.

1163
01:21:05,082 --> 01:21:15,289
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, um, the, uh, allowing, uh, the notification, the notification, uh, the inconsistent notification of what streets, how and when, uh, to be taking place.

1164
01:21:15,369 --> 01:21:26,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody, number one has a computer and not everybody drives to the city of Medford to see the big sign that says a sweet stripping is going to begin on a, you know, there has to be a better program that it has to be identified and a,

1165
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:36,626
[SPEAKER_02]: in a definitive way where people, like in other cities and towns, know on what particular week and what particular month and what particular side of the street it's going to get swept.

1166
01:21:37,246 --> 01:21:39,488
[SPEAKER_02]: And the tagging and the towing has got to be consistent.

1167
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:42,209
[SPEAKER_02]: It just cannot be arbitrary and capricious at any point in time.

1168
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:45,411
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I know the council has asked for this.

1169
01:21:45,611 --> 01:21:52,015
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to 2014, and we still haven't gotten a program presented to us as to why and how the best method is.

1170
01:21:52,515 --> 01:21:54,737
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't keep going around banging on trees

1171
01:21:55,432 --> 01:21:57,873
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, put your sawhorses up here, there, and everywhere.

1172
01:21:58,314 --> 01:21:59,354
[SPEAKER_02]: That just doesn't cut it.

1173
01:22:00,335 --> 01:22:02,036
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a comprehensive program.

1174
01:22:02,416 --> 01:22:04,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the leaf pickup program.

1175
01:22:04,077 --> 01:22:14,623
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to have something that's comprehensive, it's established, people know what it is, whether they get it in their water bill, whether they get it in their tax bill, whether they get it online.

1176
01:22:15,563 --> 01:22:17,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Something that basically says this is the way it is.

1177
01:22:18,345 --> 01:22:23,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And this goes a long way with having signage that directs itself toward these particular issues.

1178
01:22:24,165 --> 01:22:29,246
[SPEAKER_02]: City of Medford needs to get itself into a direct signage program that addresses a whole host of issues.

1179
01:22:29,966 --> 01:22:33,047
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, what better way to have a signage program become operative?

1180
01:22:33,467 --> 01:22:43,030
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be a great course to be taught up at the Medford Vocational School, where they could take during maybe the spring or the fall months of the year when the weather is good.

1181
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:52,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single street in the city can be identified, the type of street that it is, whether it's a public street, whether it's a private street, the signage that's on there, take a picture of it.

1182
01:22:53,347 --> 01:22:55,208
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I made this offering about five years ago.

1183
01:22:55,788 --> 01:23:00,690
[SPEAKER_02]: It was sent up to the vocational school, and the teacher at that time thought it was a great idea, but it never went any further.

1184
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:01,470
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, I don't know.

1185
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:05,951
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like so many things, you never find out why.

1186
01:23:06,191 --> 01:23:07,192
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to do things.

1187
01:23:07,792 --> 01:23:11,253
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is definitely a homegrown type of program.

1188
01:23:11,713 --> 01:23:12,574
[SPEAKER_02]: It can work well.

1189
01:23:13,174 --> 01:23:15,695
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely would serve a purpose here in this community.

1190
01:23:15,735 --> 01:23:21,977
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you have programs that are inconsistent, and you can't get an answer as to why I got a ticket and somebody else didn't get a ticket,

1191
01:23:22,628 --> 01:23:23,589
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of like unfair.

1192
01:23:24,049 --> 01:23:25,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with the parking kiosk program.

1193
01:23:26,051 --> 01:23:27,052
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an unfair system.

1194
01:23:27,092 --> 01:23:28,112
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't work properly.

1195
01:23:28,373 --> 01:23:30,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Same thing with these parking program here.

1196
01:23:31,055 --> 01:23:44,185
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to make a request, Mr. President, that you would probably maybe have a committee of the whole meeting set up with, you know, the council, but ahead of time, have the council have their thoughts come forward.

1197
01:23:44,703 --> 01:23:46,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe open it up to the taxpayers of this community.

1198
01:23:47,265 --> 01:23:50,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe just have a, maybe a public hearing so it can be operative for next year.

1199
01:23:50,948 --> 01:23:56,692
[SPEAKER_02]: A public hearing as it relates to setting up a designated suite streeping program here in the city of Medford.

1200
01:23:57,032 --> 01:24:04,178
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have to go through this each and every year and you don't have to listen to the complaints and consistency and transparency will tell the whole story.

1201
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:06,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

1202
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:07,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1203
01:24:07,661 --> 01:24:16,382
[SPEAKER_16]: And that would go a long way in demonstrating loud and clear to the next DPW director what the expectations of this community are.

1204
01:24:17,062 --> 01:24:18,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes the Vice President.

1205
01:24:18,983 --> 01:24:20,423
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

1206
01:24:20,503 --> 01:24:23,143
[SPEAKER_20]: I too just want to discuss the street sweeping.

1207
01:24:23,203 --> 01:24:30,765
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think it goes into the big picture of this city with regards to lack of enforcement and lack of uniformity.

1208
01:24:31,245 --> 01:24:32,485
[SPEAKER_20]: I've gotten complaints that

1209
01:24:33,084 --> 01:24:41,370
[SPEAKER_20]: from residents on Greenleaf that said there was no ticketing and towing for the street sweeping, and therefore, their street was not properly cleaned.

1210
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:44,933
[SPEAKER_20]: The trucks had to go around cars that were parked there.

1211
01:24:45,533 --> 01:24:50,036
[SPEAKER_20]: Then you go up Quincy and Capon, where they were tagging and towing.

1212
01:24:50,517 --> 01:25:00,184
[SPEAKER_20]: So they're tagging and towing on some streets some days, and they're completely not enforcing the violations on other streets other days.

1213
01:25:00,764 --> 01:25:01,685
[SPEAKER_20]: It's inconsistent.

1214
01:25:02,315 --> 01:25:03,495
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not uniform.

1215
01:25:03,695 --> 01:25:06,496
[SPEAKER_20]: The residents are left saying, what's going to happen on my street?

1216
01:25:06,556 --> 01:25:10,078
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it going to either be left unclean, or are they going to tag in tow?

1217
01:25:10,478 --> 01:25:11,298
[SPEAKER_20]: What's going to happen?

1218
01:25:11,558 --> 01:25:14,939
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, we really just need some conformity within the city.

1219
01:25:15,079 --> 01:25:17,020
[SPEAKER_20]: I've said this before on street sweeping.

1220
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:19,141
[SPEAKER_20]: I've said it before on a number of different issues.

1221
01:25:19,561 --> 01:25:21,742
[SPEAKER_20]: And we just cannot get it together with enforcement.

1222
01:25:22,282 --> 01:25:28,284
[SPEAKER_20]: And I hope the new administration really sits down and takes an approach like other cities do, like Somerville.

1223
01:25:29,045 --> 01:25:29,625
[SPEAKER_20]: enforcement.

1224
01:25:29,665 --> 01:25:30,726
[SPEAKER_20]: They enforce everything.

1225
01:25:30,806 --> 01:25:33,228
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody knows it and rules aren't broken as much.

1226
01:25:33,668 --> 01:25:37,171
[SPEAKER_20]: And their streets, number one, swept many times during the year.

1227
01:25:37,531 --> 01:25:54,082
[SPEAKER_20]: But even if we do only sweep once or twice, let's do it right and let's make sure that people know, people are notified correctly and that it's uniform throughout the community so that people know when that sign goes up, they're not left guessing, oh, will I get tagged and towed, will I not?

1228
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:58,645
[SPEAKER_20]: No, they will get their cars off the road so our streets can get swept, bottom line.

1229
01:25:59,283 --> 01:26:06,686
[SPEAKER_20]: And that goes for a number of different things that should be enforced, which is one of the reasons why we push for parking enforcement, because there was no enforcement.

1230
01:26:07,326 --> 01:26:13,648
[SPEAKER_20]: Now we're left, obviously, with a system that's not working entirely, and that's what we're left with.

1231
01:26:13,708 --> 01:26:14,689
[SPEAKER_20]: But I agree.

1232
01:26:14,709 --> 01:26:21,671
[SPEAKER_20]: We need some conformity, and whether that's us meeting with the DPW or us meeting with the new administration, let's get it done.

1233
01:26:21,972 --> 01:26:23,192
[SPEAKER_20]: In the new year, let's get it done.

1234
01:26:24,303 --> 01:26:24,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

1235
01:26:24,743 --> 01:26:26,424
[SPEAKER_04]: On that motion, uh, counsel can feel.

1236
01:26:26,644 --> 01:26:27,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1237
01:26:27,484 --> 01:26:35,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I, I too received some of the calls that, uh, not the Congress here, but, uh, the ones I got were from people are complaining that cars weren't getting towed and tagged weren't.

1238
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:53,733
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not going around and they were mad because the street was, and I did make calls to, uh, public departments and according to, um, uh, Mr. Tanaglia and the, and the police department, we had no policemen to go out there and tag and tow the cars.

1239
01:26:54,831 --> 01:26:56,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the reason they didn't get done.

1240
01:26:57,313 --> 01:27:09,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Which leads us, you know, again, in our magazine that we get from the MMA, I don't know why we're not using recently retired policemen to do those.

1241
01:27:09,822 --> 01:27:12,024
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Boston uses them, other cities use them.

1242
01:27:14,285 --> 01:27:20,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why our city's not using the recently retired policemen when the lists are all filled and you can't get anybody else.

1243
01:27:22,351 --> 01:27:23,072
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the reason.

1244
01:27:23,515 --> 01:27:26,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I was told that there were no policemen to do the details.

1245
01:27:30,539 --> 01:27:31,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get any calls.

1246
01:27:31,319 --> 01:27:35,481
[SPEAKER_04]: It was the only, only calls I got were the people complaining that cars weren't getting tagged and towed.

1247
01:27:38,703 --> 01:27:39,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1248
01:27:39,043 --> 01:27:40,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1249
01:27:40,924 --> 01:27:42,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1250
01:27:42,064 --> 01:27:43,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to amend the paper further.

1251
01:27:43,545 --> 01:27:50,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, on November 10th, we passed paper number one, five, seven, three, one, a request for the cost of the biannual street sweeping program, as well as a request,

1252
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:55,922
[SPEAKER_09]: for the numbers as to what portion is handled internally and what portion is contracted out.

1253
01:27:56,383 --> 01:28:01,705
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that falls in line with us establishing a street sweeping program that works for all, Mr. President.

1254
01:28:02,346 --> 01:28:07,669
[SPEAKER_09]: This matter was referred to the DPW response on 11-18-15, included in our packet last week.

1255
01:28:08,589 --> 01:28:15,593
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to reiterate the fact that we still await the response from the DPW, and I'd like to add that to the paper as a reminder, Mr. President.

1256
01:28:15,945 --> 01:28:19,547
[SPEAKER_02]: So on this paper, as amended by Councilor Naik, Councilor Penta.

1257
01:28:20,168 --> 01:28:23,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, you know, doing something biannually doesn't make any sense.

1258
01:28:23,750 --> 01:28:24,651
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only twice a year.

1259
01:28:25,531 --> 01:28:27,432
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you can have a program, you want it.

1260
01:28:28,333 --> 01:28:30,954
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some streets that had four sweet streepers on it.

1261
01:28:31,875 --> 01:28:33,476
[SPEAKER_02]: Some streets, you're lucky if you saw one.

1262
01:28:33,496 --> 01:28:38,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the logic, it's an inconsistent program that doesn't make any sense.

1263
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:41,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Rick just got through saying, Councilor Caraviello got through saying,

1264
01:28:42,004 --> 01:28:45,865
[SPEAKER_02]: that one of the employees in the Department of Public Works said there was no police officer available.

1265
01:28:45,925 --> 01:28:49,466
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the day that the police officer was available that was giving out tagging and towing?

1266
01:28:50,226 --> 01:28:56,667
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so inconsistent and anyone who's gotten a ticket should appeal that ticket to the city because it's inconsistent as to what's going on.

1267
01:28:57,488 --> 01:29:01,708
[SPEAKER_02]: You just can't run programs like this, like Councilor Briano just alluded to.

1268
01:29:03,349 --> 01:29:04,609
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you have transparency?

1269
01:29:04,629 --> 01:29:08,270
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a new guy coming on or a woman who's going to be a new DPW director.

1270
01:29:08,872 --> 01:29:10,453
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's got to be a direction.

1271
01:29:10,493 --> 01:29:14,694
[SPEAKER_02]: And this should be a high priority for direction that should be given to this new person coming on.

1272
01:29:15,074 --> 01:29:19,896
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't run programs that are inconsistent and incompatible to what's supposed to be done.

1273
01:29:20,216 --> 01:29:22,077
[SPEAKER_02]: But you need the signage that goes along with it.

1274
01:29:22,437 --> 01:29:26,379
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can't be Houdini trying to figure out what's going on if the streets aren't properly signed.

1275
01:29:26,739 --> 01:29:30,420
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why it's a combination of signage and consistency to the program.

1276
01:29:30,841 --> 01:29:31,841
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do it in reverse.

1277
01:29:32,041 --> 01:29:34,222
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have the program then decide to put the signage up.

1278
01:29:34,642 --> 01:29:37,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I would say, Mr. President,

1279
01:29:38,078 --> 01:29:42,960
[SPEAKER_02]: committee of the whole meeting with DPW, you know, and the public to get some of their ideas.

1280
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:43,900
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.

1281
01:29:44,161 --> 01:29:49,223
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're, you're, you're going into a new adventure, bring them in, let them know that this is their city.

1282
01:29:49,263 --> 01:29:51,223
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't a closed shop of ideas.

1283
01:29:52,344 --> 01:29:53,765
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you on that motion.

1284
01:29:54,605 --> 01:29:55,845
[SPEAKER_16]: A citizen wishes to speak.

1285
01:29:56,086 --> 01:29:56,586
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

1286
01:29:56,646 --> 01:29:58,306
[SPEAKER_16]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1287
01:29:58,366 --> 01:29:58,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Welcome.

1288
01:29:59,027 --> 01:29:59,187
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1289
01:29:59,527 --> 01:30:01,348
[SPEAKER_24]: Valerie Geiselman, three one eight high street.

1290
01:30:02,148 --> 01:30:06,850
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, this week I was happily anticipating having the corner of

1291
01:30:07,392 --> 01:30:09,234
[SPEAKER_24]: High Street and Austin Road swept.

1292
01:30:09,834 --> 01:30:17,160
[SPEAKER_24]: And as the sweepers came along, one neighbor ran out and moved her car, and there was still another large van there, and I ran to that neighbor's house.

1293
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:18,481
[SPEAKER_24]: I think I got the right house.

1294
01:30:19,042 --> 01:30:29,851
[SPEAKER_24]: Nobody was home, so the street sweeper had to go around it and leave a large swath of leaves, which I will have to pay someone to pick up or do it myself.

1295
01:30:31,032 --> 01:30:32,493
[SPEAKER_24]: And so that was very disappointing.

1296
01:30:33,253 --> 01:30:35,135
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't see any tickets on our street.

1297
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,002
[SPEAKER_24]: And I really don't like to see my neighbors getting ticketed.

1298
01:30:38,082 --> 01:30:41,805
[SPEAKER_24]: On the other hand, now I have to pay to have these leaves removed.

1299
01:30:42,625 --> 01:30:48,530
[SPEAKER_24]: And the other thought is that many people feel intimidated about raking the leaves out.

1300
01:30:49,030 --> 01:31:02,000
[SPEAKER_24]: But my understanding is if the leaves come from the trees that belong to the city, and if they're on a berm that actually belongs to the city, that it should certainly be okay to rake those leaves out so the sweeper gets them.

1301
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:04,822
[SPEAKER_24]: The sweeper doesn't come in really close anyway.

1302
01:31:05,525 --> 01:31:12,307
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you loosen up those leaves, and sometimes they're muddy and wet, and the sweeper will pick them up.

1303
01:31:13,047 --> 01:31:16,328
[SPEAKER_24]: And they are leaves from the trees that actually belong to the city.

1304
01:31:16,368 --> 01:31:17,488
[SPEAKER_24]: They're on city property.

1305
01:31:18,389 --> 01:31:23,470
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think that people are intimidated by some of the statements they hear about not sweeping.

1306
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:27,371
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously, it means not the leaves from your yard on your personal property.

1307
01:31:28,551 --> 01:31:30,952
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think it would be nice to have some of those things clarified.

1308
01:31:31,902 --> 01:31:32,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1309
01:31:33,022 --> 01:31:40,945
[SPEAKER_24]: And is there a community service at the high school that would help senior citizens sweep up leaves and things like that?

1310
01:31:42,005 --> 01:31:45,326
[SPEAKER_24]: Someone mentioned it to me, but I haven't found out about it.

1311
01:31:47,186 --> 01:31:48,046
[SPEAKER_24]: There is a program?

1312
01:31:51,587 --> 01:31:55,429
[SPEAKER_16]: We asked that as well last year, vis-a-vis shoveling snow.

1313
01:31:56,369 --> 01:32:00,070
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if we got a response back from the school department on that.

1314
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Perhaps we did.

1315
01:32:01,837 --> 01:32:03,498
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't recall, to be honest.

1316
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:04,679
[SPEAKER_16]: But we'll send that through again.

1317
01:32:04,879 --> 01:32:12,865
[SPEAKER_24]: It would be nice if the seniors could call, particularly in this kind of incident, through no fault of their own, the leaves outside.

1318
01:32:13,065 --> 01:32:17,149
[SPEAKER_24]: And these leaves happen to be right along the passageway that goes to our door.

1319
01:32:22,293 --> 01:32:26,776
[SPEAKER_20]: And try to call maybe the senior center.

1320
01:32:26,816 --> 01:32:28,357
[SPEAKER_20]: There's like four or five people that work there.

1321
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:29,939
[SPEAKER_20]: They may have some answers on who to call

1322
01:32:31,237 --> 01:32:35,402
[SPEAKER_24]: My understanding is that they usually do things that are of a safety concern.

1323
01:32:36,043 --> 01:32:38,085
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if that would fall into the category.

1324
01:32:38,365 --> 01:32:42,149
[SPEAKER_24]: And I know they have a handyman, so that's why I didn't know if I could answer that for you.

1325
01:32:42,189 --> 01:32:44,252
[SPEAKER_24]: It's usually some kind of safety repair.

1326
01:32:44,632 --> 01:32:45,533
[SPEAKER_24]: That's my understanding.

1327
01:32:45,573 --> 01:32:48,636
[SPEAKER_24]: But leaves can be a safety issue, too, if they're wet.

1328
01:32:48,656 --> 01:32:48,816
[SPEAKER_24]: True.

1329
01:32:49,758 --> 01:32:50,038
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1330
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:51,741
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

1331
01:32:52,782 --> 01:32:55,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Those pieces have been added as amendments.

1332
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:57,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

1333
01:32:57,766 --> 01:33:16,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Valerie, in my conversation with the Mayor about this problem, he said, in my conversation with the Mayor in regards to this problem, he said that anyone who calls from where there was cars parked, he would send a sweeper by to pick up the spots where they missed because of cars being in the way.

1334
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:24,762
[SPEAKER_04]: I would call the mayor's office tomorrow morning and let them know, but that's what I had a conversation with him on, I think on Thursday about this.

1335
01:33:24,782 --> 01:33:29,264
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, yeah, I know the DPW won't be happy with that, but.

1336
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:30,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1337
01:33:30,945 --> 01:33:35,087
[SPEAKER_16]: So on that motion for approval by council, Penta has amended all those in favor.

1338
01:33:35,727 --> 01:33:46,372
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed motion passes, uh, offered by council and night be resolved at the Metro city council and MBTA commuter rail division meet to address the recent cuts

1339
01:33:47,727 --> 01:33:50,628
[SPEAKER_16]: servicing the West Medford Community Rail Station.

1340
01:33:50,728 --> 01:33:51,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

1341
01:33:54,929 --> 01:33:56,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yes, Mr. President.

1342
01:33:56,250 --> 01:34:01,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, recently I was informed by, uh, several people on the train on the way into Boston as well as the conductor.

1343
01:34:01,752 --> 01:34:11,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, as I was waiting at the West Medford Commuter Rail Station to go in town last Thursday, that they were going to be making proposed cuts to the service at the West Medford Commuter Rail Station.

1344
01:34:11,735 --> 01:34:14,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I bear with me for a moment here, but, uh, the morning commute after 8 AM,

1345
01:34:15,879 --> 01:34:24,662
[SPEAKER_09]: West Medford currently has service at 8.27 a.m., 8.45 a.m., 8.58 a.m., 9.30 a.m., and 9.48 a.m.

1346
01:34:25,443 --> 01:34:38,207
[SPEAKER_09]: The changes in this service will cut the times to 8.14 a.m., 8.34 a.m., and 9.47 a.m., with what looks like about an hour and 20 minute or so gap between the last two trains during the morning rush hour commute.

1347
01:34:38,467 --> 01:34:42,749
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd be one to argue that 9.47 isn't really rush hour either, Mr. President.

1348
01:34:42,769 --> 01:34:45,310
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's a little too late for people to be getting into town to go to work.

1349
01:34:46,584 --> 01:34:53,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Also on the way home, leaving North Station to West Medford, currently we have a 410 train, a 420 train, a 440 train, a 510 train, a 550 train, a 625, a 655, and a 730 train.

1350
01:34:53,428 --> 01:35:01,573
[SPEAKER_09]: The announced changes will reflect a train at 355, 445, 510, 6 p.m., 520, and 725, with service gaps as long as a little bit over an hour, Mr. President, during some of those periods.

1351
01:35:15,277 --> 01:35:20,021
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really confused about the message that the MBTA sent to the City of Medford at this point in time, Mr. President.

1352
01:35:20,442 --> 01:35:24,885
[SPEAKER_09]: We're sitting here, we're dealing with proposed changes to our commuter rail schedule that's cutting service.

1353
01:35:25,346 --> 01:35:30,230
[SPEAKER_09]: We're sitting here looking at the privatization of our express bus routes with new contracts.

1354
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:36,595
[SPEAKER_09]: We're also sitting here looking at the state wavering on its commitment to extend the Green Line to College Avenue, Mr. President.

1355
01:35:37,095 --> 01:35:40,939
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that sends the wrong message to the City of Medford that, well, we're just a cutthroat.

1356
01:35:40,999 --> 01:35:43,521
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to lay out tracks here, but they're not going to service us, Mr. President.

1357
01:35:44,065 --> 01:35:47,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm very concerned about the direction that this matter is going in.

1358
01:35:47,626 --> 01:36:01,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And in recent days, I have been informed that our state delegation, led by Representatives Garbo and Donato and Representative Barber, have met and offered a statement relative to the proposed changes in the MBTA schedule.

1359
01:36:01,971 --> 01:36:05,612
[SPEAKER_09]: However, no definite matters have been resolved at this point in time.

1360
01:36:06,362 --> 01:36:19,465
[SPEAKER_09]: And there will be a meeting in coming days with MassDOT and MBTA officials, Mr. President, and I ask that our representatives keep us apprised of that meeting and also maybe the council can appoint a representative or invite a representative to attend.

1361
01:36:19,905 --> 01:36:27,666
[SPEAKER_09]: So the purpose of the resolution, Mr. President, is to get more information relative to the cuts at the West Medford Commuter Rail Station and the service thereof, Mr. President.

1362
01:36:27,686 --> 01:36:31,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel as though it would be detrimental to our community to allow these cuts to go through.

1363
01:36:31,087 --> 01:36:32,567
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we have limited control.

1364
01:36:33,187 --> 01:36:35,188
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I think we need to put up a fight and put up a stink.

1365
01:36:36,245 --> 01:36:40,886
[SPEAKER_09]: make sure that Medford's not a cut-through for MBTA service, but rather a place where they stop and a place where it can flourish.

1366
01:36:41,427 --> 01:36:41,707
[SPEAKER_16]: Awesome.

1367
01:36:42,087 --> 01:36:44,608
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1368
01:36:44,628 --> 01:36:44,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

1369
01:36:45,208 --> 01:36:45,888
Opposed?

1370
01:36:46,008 --> 01:36:47,209
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion passes.

1371
01:36:47,349 --> 01:36:49,409
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, would you like to make an announcement?

1372
01:36:49,609 --> 01:36:49,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1373
01:36:50,269 --> 01:36:50,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1374
01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:52,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Two more things.

1375
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:53,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1376
01:36:53,030 --> 01:36:53,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

1377
01:36:53,511 --> 01:36:59,953
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought we were all wrapped up.

1378
01:36:59,973 --> 01:37:04,274
[SPEAKER_16]: 15-769, petition by Joseph Viglione, 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford, Mass.,

1379
01:37:04,878 --> 01:37:12,161
[SPEAKER_16]: asking for $25,000 transfer from P slash E slash G monies for a new radio station.

1380
01:37:13,942 --> 01:37:22,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, Honorable City Council, Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass, 02155.

1381
01:37:23,285 --> 01:37:29,608
[SPEAKER_06]: We have all that money sitting there waiting for a public access station.

1382
01:37:30,394 --> 01:37:37,360
[SPEAKER_06]: But what if we could get Captain Barry Clemente's Connect CTY messages over a radio station?

1383
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:45,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Local artists, authors, musicians, hockey, basketball, baseball.

1384
01:37:45,607 --> 01:37:49,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Camuso just said to me there's a Malden-Medford game on Thanksgiving Day.

1385
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:51,912
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be beautiful to have on the radio.

1386
01:37:52,252 --> 01:37:59,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the audio of events, including city council events and school committee events, logged

1387
01:38:00,222 --> 01:38:04,664
[SPEAKER_06]: and kept in a file so that people could go back to them and hear them on podcasts.

1388
01:38:06,084 --> 01:38:07,425
[SPEAKER_06]: This is essential to the community.

1389
01:38:07,925 --> 01:38:12,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the Chevalier Theater is handicap accessible to the left.

1390
01:38:13,447 --> 01:38:22,910
[SPEAKER_06]: If we could take some space off the stage, build a radio station, we could broadcast every single event from the Chevalier live on audio.

1391
01:38:23,351 --> 01:38:27,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that would not hurt ticket sales because people would want to see the whole event.

1392
01:38:27,633 --> 01:38:33,875
[SPEAKER_06]: But if they couldn't get there and they wanted to hear the event with the permission of the performers, we would have it on radio.

1393
01:38:34,235 --> 01:38:37,896
[SPEAKER_06]: This would be a key to building a public access TV station.

1394
01:38:38,276 --> 01:38:49,020
[SPEAKER_06]: So with all that money sitting there, I'm asking the city council, if someone wants to get proactive and has access to the mayor, say, hey, you know, what about this idea?

1395
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:51,521
[SPEAKER_06]: So I outlined a really rough sketch

1396
01:38:51,957 --> 01:38:55,518
[SPEAKER_06]: of what the 25 grand could go to, just to get the ball rolling.

1397
01:38:55,578 --> 01:38:59,359
[SPEAKER_06]: Computers, a sound board is only $250.

1398
01:38:59,399 --> 01:39:00,459
[SPEAKER_06]: You can get microphones for $100.

1399
01:39:01,179 --> 01:39:02,419
[SPEAKER_06]: There are packages on the Internet.

1400
01:39:02,839 --> 01:39:04,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And we don't even need all that much money.

1401
01:39:04,680 --> 01:39:06,200
[SPEAKER_06]: I just put it there as a framework.

1402
01:39:07,220 --> 01:39:11,781
[SPEAKER_06]: There are plenty of ways to get a good computer at a good price and to talk to some companies.

1403
01:39:12,681 --> 01:39:20,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe a car dealership would give us a deal on a van so that we'd have a mobile van, handicap accessible, that would have the radio and a camera in it.

1404
01:39:20,507 --> 01:39:21,307
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm asking.

1405
01:39:21,347 --> 01:39:22,188
[SPEAKER_06]: The money's sitting there.

1406
01:39:22,548 --> 01:39:23,989
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see us get proactive.

1407
01:39:24,449 --> 01:39:26,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been coming up here for a good decade now.

1408
01:39:27,230 --> 01:39:30,232
[SPEAKER_06]: My first meeting was with Mark Rumley and Diane McLeod in early 2003.

1409
01:39:30,272 --> 01:39:35,835
[SPEAKER_06]: That's 12 years of honest effort, hard work, and diligence.

1410
01:39:36,075 --> 01:39:40,397
[SPEAKER_06]: So this will be very important for this community, especially with the past election.

1411
01:39:40,417 --> 01:39:41,498
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't even have radio.

1412
01:39:41,978 --> 01:39:43,099
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't have television.

1413
01:39:43,379 --> 01:39:48,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Malden, Somerville, Arlington, Winchester, Stoneham, Burlington, everyone had TV.

1414
01:39:48,581 --> 01:39:48,962
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't.

1415
01:39:50,088 --> 01:39:53,491
[SPEAKER_06]: you candidates at a disadvantage, and it put the voters at a disadvantage.

1416
01:39:54,072 --> 01:39:55,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for hearing me, counsel, tonight.

1417
01:39:59,037 --> 01:40:14,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, one of the things that present this as an enticing matter is the technology and communication is ever-changing, whether it be on public access, whether it be the private enterprise system.

1418
01:40:15,162 --> 01:40:25,344
[SPEAKER_02]: But another thing that should be looked upon with this radio station is by making it something locally accessible, you want to encourage handicapped folks to have the same opportunity.

1419
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:34,866
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that the speaker just mentioned, being at Cheviro Auditorium, whether it's there, the public library, someplace that's easily accessible on a bus route for whatever it might be.

1420
01:40:35,707 --> 01:40:39,468
[SPEAKER_02]: The proposed location for the high school of the present time is not easily accessible.

1421
01:40:39,868 --> 01:40:41,508
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not handicap accessible.

1422
01:40:41,995 --> 01:40:48,100
[SPEAKER_02]: It has too many detriments running against it, especially late at night, evenings, winter time, inclement weather and what have you.

1423
01:40:48,681 --> 01:40:59,710
[SPEAKER_02]: But this idea of having a station where people can come and be heard and hopefully be the catalyst that eventually gets ourselves with a public access station, I think it's a great idea.

1424
01:40:59,750 --> 01:41:00,410
[SPEAKER_02]: That's number one.

1425
01:41:00,951 --> 01:41:09,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, with the mayor sitting on over 300, I believe it's about $370,000 at the present time in public access money and not having public access in the city,

1426
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:11,120
[SPEAKER_02]: since December of 2013.

1427
01:41:12,001 --> 01:41:25,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this is the mayor's intentional failure to move forward on something that he is contractually bound to do according to the contract that he has not only with Comcast, but also with Verizon, who came on a couple of years ago.

1428
01:41:26,565 --> 01:41:33,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're looking at is the idea of getting small equipment at a not a very large price.

1429
01:41:33,787 --> 01:41:36,928
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not looking at 4,000 to 5,000 square feet of space.

1430
01:41:37,348 --> 01:41:38,949
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not looking at buying vehicles.

1431
01:41:38,989 --> 01:41:39,869
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at something

1432
01:41:40,363 --> 01:41:58,509
[SPEAKER_02]: that can present not only an interest in this community, but it can present itself with accessibility because that's what's mandated in the contract that Comcast just signed with the mayor for another 10 years, unfortunately, another 10 years with the same vendor without having an opportunity to have this thing monitored even after the third or the fourth, fifth year.

1433
01:41:59,150 --> 01:42:01,891
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I think what we should do is to

1434
01:42:03,853 --> 01:42:07,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to do is to get the exact dollar amount as to what we have.

1435
01:42:07,794 --> 01:42:14,436
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming into the fourth quarter of this year, and I don't think those monies will be readily available until January of next year.

1436
01:42:14,876 --> 01:42:28,759
[SPEAKER_02]: So what our monies are as of September 30th of this year, that brings us to the third quarter for Verizon and Comcast, and the idea of having, and they don't have a public access or a cable access committee.

1437
01:42:29,559 --> 01:42:31,780
[SPEAKER_02]: And without having a public access committee,

1438
01:42:32,466 --> 01:42:46,952
[SPEAKER_02]: And only leaving this in the hands of the mayor, it's quite obvious that not only whether you were a candidate, not a candidate, or whether you were a person in the community who wanted to see your elected officials or a new candidate running for office, you lost that opportunity because we have no public access.

1439
01:42:47,452 --> 01:42:51,474
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're being charged each and every month through your Verizon and your Comcast bill.

1440
01:42:52,114 --> 01:42:58,917
[SPEAKER_02]: So if this radio station is the beginning effort, if it's a catalyst to get ourselves going, I think it's a great move to do it.

1441
01:43:01,009 --> 01:43:06,754
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that being said, I would urge my colleagues to urge the president administration to go forward.

1442
01:43:07,954 --> 01:43:21,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's not going to respond back why he's not having public access, but it's another area to say, let's do this in the interest of not only public access, but it's also a public communication as it relates to what's going on here in the community.

1443
01:43:21,685 --> 01:43:25,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single person behind this rail, every single person on the other side of the rail.

1444
01:43:25,525 --> 01:43:36,070
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have that opportunity to be on the radio, to be interviewed, or to possibly have a show that talks about our city of Medford, whether you like or dislike, and where we need to go.

1445
01:43:36,730 --> 01:43:42,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't understand why this administration was in such fear of having public access.

1446
01:43:42,433 --> 01:43:46,755
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know what he could have possibly thought that public access was going to do to him.

1447
01:43:47,375 --> 01:43:48,916
[SPEAKER_02]: He's not serving in office anymore.

1448
01:43:49,316 --> 01:43:50,096
[SPEAKER_02]: He's retiring.

1449
01:43:50,476 --> 01:43:52,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So his office wasn't even that issue.

1450
01:43:54,158 --> 01:44:00,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single council that's here that ran, that ran for reelection, every new council that was running, the school committee, they were denied a privilege.

1451
01:44:01,382 --> 01:44:03,323
[SPEAKER_02]: They were denied their opportunity to go forward.

1452
01:44:03,603 --> 01:44:05,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what public access is all about.

1453
01:44:05,924 --> 01:44:11,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So here is another opportunity through the mechanisms of public access to have a public radio offering.

1454
01:44:11,847 --> 01:44:14,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think it's a great way to go forward.

1455
01:44:14,088 --> 01:44:21,592
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mr. Mayor, excuse me, Mr. President, I'm going to ask that you, and I don't know if you're going to be the incoming president,

1456
01:44:21,938 --> 01:44:24,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, who the new president's going to be next year for the city council?

1457
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you might be the mayor, you never know.

1458
01:44:27,700 --> 01:44:38,645
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact of the matter is this, that whoever the president's gonna be should take the leadership role to move on this particular issue in the interest not only of public information, but just in the interest of the city of Medford.

1459
01:44:40,146 --> 01:44:41,166
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it you, Councilor Camuso?

1460
01:44:41,186 --> 01:44:47,769
[SPEAKER_02]: They just said they were, Marlin is having this televised for their football game coming up as they, was it?

1461
01:44:47,789 --> 01:44:48,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, was it Joe?

1462
01:44:48,489 --> 01:44:49,570
[SPEAKER_02]: You said it, I'm sorry, you said it.

1463
01:44:51,999 --> 01:44:52,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a big game, right?

1464
01:44:52,840 --> 01:44:54,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we don't have nobody to do our big game, okay?

1465
01:44:55,402 --> 01:44:57,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And we haven't had anybody to do our big game for years.

1466
01:44:57,964 --> 01:45:04,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sad part about it is each and every month you just keep paying out in your Verizon and your Comcast bills.

1467
01:45:04,650 --> 01:45:05,311
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not fair.

1468
01:45:05,871 --> 01:45:10,275
[SPEAKER_02]: And the taxpayers of this community, the rate payers for cable television deserve better.

1469
01:45:10,456 --> 01:45:13,778
[SPEAKER_02]: They deserve to have their money used and used properly.

1470
01:45:14,419 --> 01:45:15,460
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's being said.

1471
01:45:15,833 --> 01:45:19,254
[SPEAKER_15]: on the motion of Council Penter to send this paper to the mayor's office?

1472
01:45:19,334 --> 01:45:38,000
[SPEAKER_02]: No, to send it to you, whoever the president's going to be next year, to enforce, to request of the mayor to go forward with a committee, which would be a cable committee that would serve in the best interest of this community, that not only addresses peg access by way of public television, but also public access and a radio system.

1473
01:45:40,321 --> 01:45:41,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair recognizes Councilor Cafferill.

1474
01:45:42,022 --> 01:45:42,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1475
01:45:43,715 --> 01:45:46,176
[SPEAKER_04]: The Method Mall game is one of the oldest rivalries in this country.

1476
01:45:46,497 --> 01:45:46,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1477
01:45:46,937 --> 01:45:47,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Second oldest.

1478
01:45:48,098 --> 01:45:55,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be nice if, uh, uh, during my high school days and, um, you didn't watch me play.

1479
01:45:55,902 --> 01:45:57,123
[SPEAKER_04]: You may have watched Clark Finn play.

1480
01:45:57,163 --> 01:45:57,963
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't watch me play.

1481
01:45:58,644 --> 01:46:02,366
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, but it'd be nice if we could, you know, maybe get that game on for people who don't go the game.

1482
01:46:03,787 --> 01:46:08,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, maybe, uh, the high school, uh, could tape it and get it on there for Thanksgiving afternoon.

1483
01:46:08,810 --> 01:46:12,252
[SPEAKER_04]: I know a lot of people look forward to watching that game again.

1484
01:46:12,672 --> 01:46:14,892
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the second oldest rivalry in the United States.

1485
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:17,033
[SPEAKER_04]: It'd be nice to see it on some kind of axis.

1486
01:46:17,593 --> 01:46:18,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1487
01:46:20,033 --> 01:46:21,134
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could call the game.

1488
01:46:21,214 --> 01:46:22,114
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not that talented.

1489
01:46:22,994 --> 01:46:23,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, you are.

1490
01:46:23,594 --> 01:46:25,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I do.

1491
01:46:25,634 --> 01:46:28,835
[SPEAKER_16]: A motion for approval by Councilor Penta as amended by Councilor Caraviello.

1492
01:46:28,895 --> 01:46:29,695
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1493
01:46:29,835 --> 01:46:35,796
[SPEAKER_09]: The paper is referring it to me for action for next year.

1494
01:46:42,814 --> 01:46:49,858
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, I said we've heard from the President, whether it be Councilor Dello Russo or whoever, if you want to take action before the end of the year, so be it.

1495
01:46:50,278 --> 01:46:53,140
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it definitely needs to have a public access committee.

1496
01:46:53,620 --> 01:47:02,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think at your behest or whoever the President's behest is, they encourage the Mayor to go forward and put that committee together so we can go forward with public access.

1497
01:47:03,326 --> 01:47:04,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk has that.

1498
01:47:07,389 --> 01:47:09,510
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we'll discuss that in the next term then.

1499
01:47:11,252 --> 01:47:11,672
[SPEAKER_16]: If I may.

1500
01:47:12,593 --> 01:47:15,835
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes the man at the podium.

1501
01:47:15,855 --> 01:47:17,456
[SPEAKER_06]: 59 Garfield Ave., Joe Villione again.

1502
01:47:17,836 --> 01:47:21,579
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, Malden Access TV, I've worked with them hand-in-hand.

1503
01:47:21,599 --> 01:47:24,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I brought a lot of musicians to Malden Access TV.

1504
01:47:25,021 --> 01:47:29,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe they'll be taping it, in which case I will contact them tomorrow and see if they are.

1505
01:47:29,724 --> 01:47:31,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I would volunteer my services.

1506
01:47:31,845 --> 01:47:33,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I have things to do, of course, on Thanksgiving Day.

1507
01:47:35,442 --> 01:47:37,724
[SPEAKER_06]: providing this time, it should be documented.

1508
01:47:37,764 --> 01:47:42,488
[SPEAKER_06]: So I will reach out to MATV and maybe we can put it on the government or high school channel.

1509
01:47:44,009 --> 01:47:46,491
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Vice President Legelmarks.

1510
01:47:46,651 --> 01:47:48,833
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, President De La Ruzo.

1511
01:47:48,893 --> 01:47:52,095
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want to second Councilor Pence's resolve.

1512
01:47:52,516 --> 01:48:01,763
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we do need to figure out where we're going to go with the TV access come new administration, especially the voters were disadvantaged.

1513
01:48:01,823 --> 01:48:03,464
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree with that wholeheartedly.

1514
01:48:04,715 --> 01:48:06,076
[SPEAKER_20]: Candidates were disadvantaged.

1515
01:48:07,077 --> 01:48:11,260
[SPEAKER_20]: We also have had such a failure to move forward, and it's a shame.

1516
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:14,802
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like we're stealing from the ratepayers.

1517
01:48:15,122 --> 01:48:24,069
[SPEAKER_20]: We have a portion of money that's being set aside from your cable bill, and it's not being used.

1518
01:48:24,149 --> 01:48:25,650
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just sitting there.

1519
01:48:25,690 --> 01:48:29,813
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know how we're going to move forward, and it seems to be just a complete stall.

1520
01:48:31,134 --> 01:48:32,875
[SPEAKER_20]: This is something that has been

1521
01:48:33,358 --> 01:48:46,709
[SPEAKER_20]: on the council's agenda for a very long time, and we luckily were able to shut down TV3 a couple years ago, but it's just an absolute shame that we can't move forward on a TV station that the ratepayers are paying for.

1522
01:48:46,729 --> 01:48:59,880
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that if we're going to move forward, the next council and the next administration have to be at the table together to make a decision to see where this is going to go, because as you said, and I apologize for speaking from the chair,

1523
01:49:00,694 --> 01:49:16,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but Councilor Penta has pointed out consistently as have all the other Councilors and you met and vice president that, um, uh, people's, uh, uh, portion of people's pay for cable is, uh, uh, being attached for these services.

1524
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,800
[SPEAKER_16]: So, uh, we've got to come to a just resolution on this.

1525
01:49:20,541 --> 01:49:25,022
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion of council Penter, all those in favor, well, call has been requested.

1733
02:00:47,973 --> 02:00:48,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Did I say that backwards?

1734
02:00:49,994 --> 02:00:50,314
[SPEAKER_16]: Yikes.

1735
02:00:51,535 --> 02:00:55,317
[SPEAKER_16]: Offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the City Council congratulate

02:01:04,257 --> 02:01:06,178
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to congratulate the Junior Mustangs.

1740
02:01:06,198 --> 02:01:06,878
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd be remiss.

1741
02:01:08,498 --> 02:01:12,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Several of the girls' cheerleading teams also took first place in some of their competitions.

[SPEAKER_16]: Two, Medford High School boys' soccer team, greater Boston League champs and state semifinalists.

1750

1751
02:01:53,052 --> 02:01:53,712
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

1752
02:01:55,493 --> 02:02:10,661
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, yes, we've had a very successful fall season this year, and in course with past practice, I'd like to invite the following GBL championship teams down to receive a memoriam citation from the city council in recognition of their hard work, their teamwork, and their efforts, Mr. President.

1753
02:02:11,081 --> 02:02:11,441
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

1754
02:02:11,481 --> 02:02:13,062
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

1755
02:02:13,442 --> 02:02:14,183
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

1756
02:02:16,024 --> 02:02:16,464
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

1757
02:02:17,424 --> 02:02:18,105
[SPEAKER_16]: With pleasure.

1758
02:02:18,685 --> 02:02:20,726
[SPEAKER_16]: Announcements by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1759
02:02:21,268 --> 02:02:22,789
[SPEAKER_20]: And thank you, President Dello Russo.

1760
02:02:22,849 --> 02:02:33,873
[SPEAKER_20]: Last week, Council Marks and I, which was supported by the entire council, asked that the month of December be free parking month to help out the commerce within our city.

1761
02:02:34,654 --> 02:02:44,578
[SPEAKER_20]: And it wasn't supported by the administration in full, but I just want to announce and make sure that residents know that parking will be free of charge on Saturdays.

1762
02:02:45,300 --> 02:02:52,742
[SPEAKER_20]: during the holiday shopping period throughout Medford Square as well as Haines Square, West Medford Square, Hillside Square, and South Medford Square.

1763
02:02:53,242 --> 02:03:05,626
[SPEAKER_20]: So on Saturdays beginning November 28th and ending January 2nd, patrons visiting local businesses in these designated areas will be able to obtain goods and services without having to pay meters or kiosks.

1764
02:03:06,346 --> 02:03:17,151
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd also just like to ask that we do put signage on our kiosk that Saturday is free parking, or we make sure that the meters do not accept money so that everybody knows.

1765
02:03:17,191 --> 02:03:26,196
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it's going to be hard to get the word out to everybody, but Saturdays from November 28th to January 2nd, there will be free parking in Medford, in our squares.

1766
02:03:26,596 --> 02:03:29,998
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want to thank the administration for taking our recommendation.

1767
02:03:30,715 --> 02:03:35,137
[SPEAKER_20]: And moving it forward, even though it's not in its entirety, it's something.

1768
02:03:35,237 --> 02:03:38,878
[SPEAKER_20]: It's something for the customers and the businesses.

1769
02:03:39,279 --> 02:03:40,219
[SPEAKER_20]: So, thank you.

1770
02:03:41,319 --> 02:03:41,679
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1771
02:03:42,660 --> 02:03:43,360
[SPEAKER_16]: The records.

1772
02:03:44,721 --> 02:03:45,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Penta.

1773
02:03:46,341 --> 02:03:51,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, earlier this evening, the Committee on Transportation met as it related to papers in committee.

1774
02:03:52,924 --> 02:04:00,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the things we discussed were the concerns as it relates to the Craddock Bridge, bus stops in Medford Square and in West Medford.

1775
02:04:01,015 --> 02:04:03,297
[SPEAKER_02]: and other ancillary matters.

1776
02:04:03,897 --> 02:04:26,671
[SPEAKER_02]: What was disturbing that came out of that meeting was when one of the, um, one of the, uh, business owners came in and indicated to us that, um, per his conversation with representative Donato, who had a conversation with somebody from the mass department of transportation, they have been meeting here with the city of Medford on a biweekly basis with a gentleman from the department of public works.

1777
02:04:27,391 --> 02:04:30,493
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is very disturbing to hear that because right now nobody,

1778
02:04:30,947 --> 02:04:48,121
[SPEAKER_02]: assert anything, we have asked on numerous occasions for some kind of transparency as it relates to what is going on, as it relates to not only the Karatek Bridge, the time schedule, the lighting, the closing down of the business, just having some basis of information.

1779
02:04:48,681 --> 02:04:59,150
[SPEAKER_02]: We were also told and notified, and Councilor Caraviello, he can correct me on this, that the Chamber of Commerce hasn't even been a party to any kind of response or any kind of notification from the State Department of Transportation.

1780
02:04:59,923 --> 02:05:08,246
[SPEAKER_02]: That leaves a big void right now into trying to understand what is going on between the state department of transportation and their interaction here in the city of Medford.

1781
02:05:08,826 --> 02:05:19,569
[SPEAKER_02]: If in fact the city of Medford is meeting with the state department of transportation and they are not notifying this council and the office of community development is not being notified and the business merchants aren't being notified.

1782
02:05:20,169 --> 02:05:25,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Chamber of commerce is not being notified and the council has asked on numerous occasions for an update as to what's going on.

1783
02:05:26,436 --> 02:05:30,538
[SPEAKER_02]: there was a serious problem as it relates to that whole Craddock bridge operation.

1784
02:05:31,098 --> 02:05:39,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Another part of the committee report was asking, you know, it's supposed to be six days a week, double shifts, and everybody knows they're not down there six days a week, double shifts.

1785
02:05:40,401 --> 02:05:46,604
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe that's the reason why it's taking two and a half years to maybe complete this, but further asking a question on that.

1786
02:05:47,244 --> 02:05:53,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I believe the bus stop as it relates to in West and South Medford, that's in front of Oasis,

1787
02:05:53,605 --> 02:05:57,728
[SPEAKER_02]: the request to have it be moved across the street to where the dry cleaners is over there.

1788
02:05:58,409 --> 02:06:00,971
[SPEAKER_02]: That seemed to be an understandable issue.

1789
02:06:01,391 --> 02:06:15,181
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that there will be a meeting set up in the South Medford area over there quickly as it relates to the bus stop, not only the bus stop moving, but a place for the business merchants when they have deliveries that take place over there.

1790
02:06:15,962 --> 02:06:20,325
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe also the request and the concern was to go forward

1791
02:06:20,726 --> 02:06:29,310
[SPEAKER_02]: regarding the bus stops in Medford Square that would be coming down on Main Street and having them either detoured to Riverside Ave or River Street or whatever it might be.

1792
02:06:30,071 --> 02:06:40,156
[SPEAKER_02]: But we got a notification, Mr. Clerk, you can correct me if I'm wrong, that the gentleman who now is in charge of bus stops with the T made an indication that he doesn't come out to nighttime meetings, is that correct?

1793
02:06:40,576 --> 02:06:44,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And because he doesn't come out to nighttime meetings, this doesn't make any sense at all.

1794
02:06:44,693 --> 02:06:46,974
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to have to figure out another way how to move them.

1795
02:06:47,014 --> 02:06:50,636
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe our representative, Mr. Donato can make this guy understand it.

1796
02:06:50,676 --> 02:06:56,419
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everyone works during the course of the day and you know, and that's part of their job to come to the city of Medford.

1797
02:06:56,459 --> 02:06:57,599
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a huge project.

1798
02:06:58,080 --> 02:06:59,400
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new huge undertaking.

1799
02:06:59,861 --> 02:07:07,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Bus stops are a huge issue as it relates to this, this whole undertaking as a result of their lack of transparency and coming forward.

1800
02:07:07,544 --> 02:07:10,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was a vote of the committee for which council Lungo current,

1801
02:07:11,408 --> 02:07:15,330
[SPEAKER_02]: and Michael Knox, and unfortunately he had to leave because of a family issue.

1802
02:07:16,850 --> 02:07:24,553
[SPEAKER_02]: We made a request that a temporary cease and desist on the whole project of the Craddock Bridge become operative.

1803
02:07:25,274 --> 02:07:31,576
[SPEAKER_02]: It's obvious that they're being absolutely non-responsive, non-responsive to the council, not responsive to anyone here in the city of Medford.

1804
02:07:32,036 --> 02:07:38,079
[SPEAKER_02]: But the sad part about it is if they really are meeting with somebody from the Department of Public Works,

1805
02:07:38,503 --> 02:07:39,644
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not being notified.

1806
02:07:39,704 --> 02:07:41,666
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have asked over and over and over again.

1807
02:07:42,266 --> 02:07:45,069
[SPEAKER_02]: This shows you the complete breakdown that is taking place.

1808
02:07:45,549 --> 02:08:03,024
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only way maybe to get their attention is to move, Mr. President, and ask for a temporary cease and desist to bring them to the table so we can have this discussion as to why we, the taxpayers, we, the council, we, the chamber, and we, the administration, aren't being brought up to date and being told it's up to date.

1809
02:08:03,444 --> 02:08:05,386
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just an unfortunate matter.

1810
02:08:06,274 --> 02:08:07,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Businesses are being affected.

1811
02:08:07,355 --> 02:08:10,257
[SPEAKER_02]: One business merchant came in there and indicated how he had it closed down.

1812
02:08:10,677 --> 02:08:16,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Lost over $3,000 worth of business on a particular night, the night that they put the bridge up, with no notification and what have you.

1813
02:08:17,942 --> 02:08:19,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So- Go ahead.

1814
02:08:20,184 --> 02:08:21,344
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to interrupt you, Councilor.

1815
02:08:21,364 --> 02:08:21,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead.

1816
02:08:22,105 --> 02:08:27,028
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could just share one piece of information on that long presentation that you gave us.

1817
02:08:28,309 --> 02:08:35,474
[SPEAKER_16]: The legislative liaison for the Department of Transportation was aware of the situation with the bus stop inspector.

1818
02:08:36,376 --> 02:08:39,277
[SPEAKER_16]: or overseer, whatever his proper title is.

1819
02:08:39,957 --> 02:08:51,862
[SPEAKER_16]: And he's reached out to the legislative liaison for the MBTA and CC'd her on our meeting that's coming up next week when the group will come down and present.

1820
02:08:53,022 --> 02:09:01,725
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm in the process of reaching out to her as well, but unfortunately I don't know if you've ever called the MBTA and gone into the phone system

1821
02:09:02,435 --> 02:09:05,336
[SPEAKER_16]: And it feels like you're going into a spiral to another world.

1822
02:09:07,057 --> 02:09:10,099
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm trying to reach out as well.

1823
02:09:10,159 --> 02:09:15,061
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully- Well, the gentleman that's now replaced the lady that was in charge of bus stops, I'll give you his number.

1824
02:09:15,081 --> 02:09:16,241
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll give everybody his number if you want.

1825
02:09:16,261 --> 02:09:17,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I've spoken to him.

1826
02:09:17,482 --> 02:09:17,742
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1827
02:09:17,762 --> 02:09:20,883
[SPEAKER_16]: But who I wanted to speak to was the legislative liaison.

1828
02:09:21,364 --> 02:09:23,645
[SPEAKER_02]: But it won't make any difference who the legislative liaison is.

1829
02:09:23,685 --> 02:09:25,826
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact of the matter is this is all after the fact.

1830
02:09:26,326 --> 02:09:29,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you have a meeting scheduled, I think, for next Tuesday?

1831
02:09:29,267 --> 02:09:29,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1832
02:09:30,028 --> 02:09:30,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is next Tuesday.

1833
02:09:31,903 --> 02:09:47,730
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if they get the temperament that the council is not happy, and this seems to be a forced situation, these resolutions go back to June of this past year, September of this year, for which I've asked on numerous occasions, and other members of the council have expressed their disdain as to what's going on.

1834
02:09:48,250 --> 02:09:51,012
[SPEAKER_02]: There's absolutely, it seems to be a forced situation.

1835
02:09:51,372 --> 02:09:56,994
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only way to keep their feet to the fire is to let them know that not only are we upset, but we don't approve of what's going on.

1836
02:09:57,415 --> 02:10:00,656
[SPEAKER_02]: And all this is is basically having a temporary restraining order against you,

1837
02:10:00,992 --> 02:10:04,114
[SPEAKER_02]: to not do any more business until such time that you get this issue resolved.

1838
02:10:04,735 --> 02:10:05,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is the clerk of the works?

1839
02:10:05,916 --> 02:10:08,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Who is the city's clerk of the works on this particular project?

1840
02:10:10,399 --> 02:10:11,680
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have any of these people.

1841
02:10:11,700 --> 02:10:16,043
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we do, they must be mysterious people, because nobody knows who they are.

1842
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:20,387
[SPEAKER_02]: This council should be apprised through every part of that particular project.

1843
02:10:20,547 --> 02:10:26,171
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been going on since 2003, when Councilor Lungo-Koehn brought this resolution up for the very first time.

1844
02:10:26,727 --> 02:10:29,608
[SPEAKER_02]: This is now 2015, 12 years later.

1845
02:10:30,188 --> 02:10:32,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bridge did not sink in 12 years.

1846
02:10:32,729 --> 02:10:34,129
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been there for over 100 years.

1847
02:10:34,449 --> 02:10:35,930
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite obvious that it'll make it.

1848
02:10:36,430 --> 02:10:41,452
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, sometimes you've got to push and be hard to make sure you get your questions resolved.

1849
02:10:41,912 --> 02:10:43,272
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the result.

1850
02:10:43,312 --> 02:10:45,093
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the report coming out of the committee.

1851
02:10:45,653 --> 02:10:46,973
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll move the question to the floor.

1852
02:10:47,954 --> 02:10:48,394
[SPEAKER_20]: If I may.

1853
02:10:48,414 --> 02:10:49,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam Vice President.

1854
02:10:52,075 --> 02:10:53,375
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Vice President wanted to speak.

1855
02:10:53,455 --> 02:10:54,696
[SPEAKER_16]: Did you speak, Councilor?

1856
02:10:54,736 --> 02:10:55,216
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't hear you.

1857
02:10:56,328 --> 02:10:59,370
[SPEAKER_09]: I said that I would like a ruling on Rule 35A.

1858
02:11:00,171 --> 02:11:01,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Rule 35A.

1859
02:11:02,293 --> 02:11:19,385
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just going to say, I was at the meeting at 530 and I too, there's a lack of communication and maybe we should hold off one week before the cease and desist because the communication is between the city council, city hall, DPW, OCD, and the business owners.

1860
02:11:19,778 --> 02:11:22,160
[SPEAKER_20]: The business owners really don't know what's going on.

1861
02:11:22,200 --> 02:11:24,422
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't know any given night there's going to be work done.

1862
02:11:24,442 --> 02:11:27,345
[SPEAKER_20]: They're going to be shut down, especially the restaurants in the area.

1863
02:11:27,765 --> 02:11:37,334
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we could get an update from the DPW director, does MassDOT actually meet with somebody from the DPW every other week to discuss what's going on?

1864
02:11:37,374 --> 02:11:46,442
[SPEAKER_20]: Because if so, that communication should be forwarded to the rest of the city and especially the business owners and the city council and obviously the administration.

1865
02:11:46,998 --> 02:11:58,448
[SPEAKER_20]: But I also wanted to get an update from OCD Director Lauren DiLorenzo, because she was not involved in the process a year, maybe two ago, when they were moving forward with it.

1866
02:11:58,788 --> 02:12:01,530
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'd like to know now, is she being updated?

1867
02:12:01,610 --> 02:12:02,751
[SPEAKER_20]: Does she know what's going on?

1868
02:12:02,811 --> 02:12:05,354
[SPEAKER_20]: Does she know any given night when they'll be doing work?

1869
02:12:05,574 --> 02:12:12,159
[SPEAKER_20]: Or is that, who knows, and why isn't it being communicated throughout the rest of the city, is my question.

1870
02:12:12,179 --> 02:12:13,481
[SPEAKER_20]: Because that is a problem.

1871
02:12:13,541 --> 02:12:15,062
[SPEAKER_20]: If I owned a business in Medford Square,

1872
02:12:15,607 --> 02:12:20,730
[SPEAKER_20]: and I knew a temporary bridge was going to be put up, and the street was going to be shut down, I would want some notice.

1873
02:12:20,830 --> 02:12:23,873
[SPEAKER_20]: And I would, you know, business owners deserve some notice.

1874
02:12:23,933 --> 02:12:26,534
[SPEAKER_20]: So I agree with what Councilor Penta is saying.

1875
02:12:26,574 --> 02:12:27,495
[SPEAKER_20]: I was there for the meeting.

1876
02:12:28,255 --> 02:12:29,616
[SPEAKER_20]: We listened to the business owners.

1877
02:12:30,517 --> 02:12:40,544
[SPEAKER_20]: So if we could just get those questions answered first, because is it the lack of communication within City Hall trickling down, or is there actually just a lack of communication from MassDOT?

1878
02:12:43,228 --> 02:12:52,051
[SPEAKER_20]: The city deserves explanation on an outline of what's going to take place week after week after week, since this is going to inconvenience us for another two to three years.

1879
02:12:53,472 --> 02:12:56,313
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Vice President, so that we're going to do as an amendment.

1880
02:12:59,154 --> 02:13:07,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, in addition to the report, we'd have to withdraw then the request for termination of activities.

1881
02:13:08,317 --> 02:13:10,098
[SPEAKER_16]: But can I just briefly comment?

1882
02:13:10,609 --> 02:13:22,049
[SPEAKER_16]: I receive at least twice a week, because I've been involved since day one on the whole Green Line Extension project, a very well-managed project, whether you agree with it or not.

1883
02:13:24,399 --> 02:13:28,640
[SPEAKER_16]: development of its history throughout the decade here.

1884
02:13:29,381 --> 02:13:40,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Nonetheless, twice a week, anybody who's on their email list gets an email blast on updates on every aspect of that project, whether it's in Medford, Somerville, Cambridge.

1885
02:13:40,564 --> 02:13:41,364
[SPEAKER_20]: Greenline.

1886
02:13:41,524 --> 02:13:41,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Greenline.

1887
02:13:42,385 --> 02:13:43,465
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no reason why.

1888
02:13:43,485 --> 02:13:47,726
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems to me that this is a matter of Harvard communication.

1889
02:13:47,746 --> 02:13:53,488
[SPEAKER_16]: The incident two weeks ago, when they shut down Main Street and people weren't notified

1890
02:13:54,219 --> 02:13:56,260
[SPEAKER_16]: um, is, uh, is horrid.

1891
02:13:56,841 --> 02:14:00,583
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, there's gotta be an issue regarding communication.

1892
02:14:01,063 --> 02:14:09,908
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not surprised that, uh, any, uh, major construction project has biweekly updates with the DPW or somebody in this building.

1893
02:14:10,349 --> 02:14:13,730
[SPEAKER_16]: But, um, it clearly, again, that's not being communicated out.

1894
02:14:14,331 --> 02:14:17,313
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, there's no reason why the businesses should suffer.

1895
02:14:17,813 --> 02:14:23,096
[SPEAKER_16]: And we were told at the beginning, uh, this summer that there would be a outreach person from, uh,

1896
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:26,444
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it Zane Construction, Zillow, Zane?

1897
02:14:26,544 --> 02:14:26,845
[SPEAKER_16]: Zopo.

1898
02:14:27,205 --> 02:14:28,507
[SPEAKER_16]: Zopo Construction.

1899
02:14:28,967 --> 02:14:39,021
[SPEAKER_16]: So I hope we can get that all resolved, but I want to recognize Councilor Camuso, who's been patiently waiting while I've spoken from the chair.

1900
02:14:39,041 --> 02:14:39,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1901
02:14:41,328 --> 02:14:54,260
[SPEAKER_07]: And I certainly agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn's frustrations and the business owners that should have close to up to the minute what's going on with the project, especially when it affects their businesses.

1902
02:14:54,701 --> 02:14:59,405
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't want to send out the wrong message that if the City Council votes for a cease and desist,

1903
02:14:59,902 --> 02:15:03,204
[SPEAKER_07]: that the trucks are going to pack up, they're going to leave, and there'll be no work that gets done.

1904
02:15:03,544 --> 02:15:04,725
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just inaccurate.

1905
02:15:04,865 --> 02:15:11,308
[SPEAKER_07]: It's irresponsible for us to let people think that we have the power to do that, because we do not.

1906
02:15:11,728 --> 02:15:19,732
[SPEAKER_07]: Furthermore, if we do delay it, if we had the authority for a cease and desist, it's only going to add additional days on the end of the project.

1907
02:15:20,072 --> 02:15:23,434
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'll be two years and three days if we did that.

1908
02:15:23,834 --> 02:15:28,697
[SPEAKER_07]: So as I stated, I think they have to work on their communication.

1909
02:15:29,180 --> 02:15:45,728
[SPEAKER_07]: The particular department that is overseeing this project, which is a state project, if not the City of Medford, the Mass Department of Transportation, as the President indicated, between them and the Gaming Commission, I'm getting emails twice a week.

1910
02:15:46,359 --> 02:15:47,660
[SPEAKER_07]: with updates on the projects.

1911
02:15:48,260 --> 02:16:07,908
[SPEAKER_07]: And given that that's the same entity, MassDOT, I don't see why we can't get the same, and interested people like the restaurants, like the banks, like the auto schools and everyone else in the particular area can sign up for those alerts as well, as people along the Green Line Extension route receive weekly.

1912
02:16:08,448 --> 02:16:13,530
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we could just ask for that, but I just don't want to send out the wrong message that a cease and desist

1913
02:16:14,190 --> 02:16:17,571
[SPEAKER_07]: is something that we have any control over whatsoever.

1914
02:16:17,591 --> 02:16:20,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1915
02:16:20,292 --> 02:16:20,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Pentland.

1916
02:16:21,712 --> 02:16:23,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think—I hear what you're saying, Councilor Camuso.

1917
02:16:23,813 --> 02:16:25,093
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not sending out the wrong message.

1918
02:16:25,153 --> 02:16:29,315
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sending out a message that we're really upset that they have no way to operate like this.

1919
02:16:29,795 --> 02:16:30,735
[SPEAKER_02]: But two points.

1920
02:16:30,775 --> 02:16:39,258
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is this, that even if this were to happen, that back in the days—that's not true because they were supposed to be doing two shifts right from the beginning.

1921
02:16:39,938 --> 02:16:42,939
[SPEAKER_02]: They're lucky if they work three days a week, if they're working three to four right now.

1922
02:16:43,258 --> 02:16:44,339
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're not doing double shifts.

1923
02:16:44,759 --> 02:16:45,980
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not really worried about that.

1924
02:16:46,020 --> 02:17:00,031
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just more concerned over the fact that if, in fact, these meetings have taken place, then the responsible person in behalf of the city has failed to notify the appropriate authority, whether it be at the mayor's office, the council, OCD office, or whatever it might be.

1925
02:17:00,492 --> 02:17:04,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And the last part, Mr. Clerk, I forgot to mention, is to get the minutes of those meetings.

1926
02:17:04,575 --> 02:17:05,316
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's on there.

1927
02:17:05,636 --> 02:17:06,857
[SPEAKER_02]: The minutes of the meetings that

1928
02:17:07,494 --> 02:17:25,009
[SPEAKER_02]: DOT has had whoever the city person is that has been to the meetings on this biweekly basis, you know, if, um, if a representative Donato has been told by DOT that the meeting has been taking place, uh, according to him, as he explained to one of the business vendors in the community, then, you know, something's going on here.

1929
02:17:25,069 --> 02:17:26,090
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody knows nothing about it.

1930
02:17:26,110 --> 02:17:26,931
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make any sense.

1931
02:17:26,991 --> 02:17:27,531
[SPEAKER_02]: It's unfair.

1932
02:17:28,252 --> 02:17:34,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I'll hold off on a week until we, after the meeting of next Tuesday, and then, uh, let's just see where we're going.

1933
02:17:34,778 --> 02:17:35,218
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know,

1934
02:17:35,689 --> 02:17:38,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, they'll be really forthcoming with some of these things.

1935
02:17:38,150 --> 02:17:39,971
[SPEAKER_02]: They're willing to budge and work with us.

1936
02:17:39,991 --> 02:17:44,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond that, you just hope the MBTA comes here, too, because you can't piecemeal this thing together.

1937
02:17:45,174 --> 02:17:46,234
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not making any sense.

1938
02:17:49,276 --> 02:17:50,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's not that.

1939
02:17:50,516 --> 02:17:52,557
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we have our representatives and senators.

1940
02:17:52,597 --> 02:17:54,398
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where their clout comes in, OK?

1941
02:17:54,819 --> 02:18:03,663
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're really worth their salt as an elected official up in the statehouse, they'll get those people here from the MBTA, because they're not going to want to hear us.

1942
02:18:06,146 --> 02:18:15,894
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the motion of... Mr. President, I agree with Councilor Pinter, you know, as far as the lack of communication and even with the chamber and everybody else.

1943
02:18:15,914 --> 02:18:24,581
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I don't know if we're in a position to dictate whether we can do a cease and desist order on this company.

1944
02:18:25,141 --> 02:18:28,584
[SPEAKER_04]: But I do recognize that there does need to be more communication happening here.

1945
02:18:29,105 --> 02:18:33,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd hate to send the wrong message to the construction company.

1946
02:18:35,295 --> 02:18:36,895
[SPEAKER_04]: by, by sending FC synthesis.

1947
02:18:37,616 --> 02:18:37,976
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good.

1948
02:18:38,616 --> 02:18:53,199
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion of council of Penta that the city council receive, um, the minutes, the minutes of meetings, any and all meetings between the city representative and D O T. Okay.

1949
02:18:53,679 --> 02:19:04,402
[SPEAKER_09]: And also that we have a representative, um, point of order council night pursuant to council rules and the rule 35, no report of a committee shall be received unless agreed to in committee and actually assembled.

1950
02:19:04,910 --> 02:19:10,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Rule 35A, the council and the president shall review all committee papers in a committee of the whole meeting thereafter.

1951
02:19:10,391 --> 02:19:15,533
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the whole idea, Mr. President, is every single committee that's made a report has been voted upon and accepted by this council.

1952
02:19:15,573 --> 02:19:17,153
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, all of a sudden, what are we going to do?

1953
02:19:17,173 --> 02:19:19,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to a committee of the whole meeting and discuss what took place there?

1954
02:19:19,874 --> 02:19:22,574
[SPEAKER_02]: If the council wanted to be there, he walked right by, couldn't come into the room.

1955
02:19:22,774 --> 02:19:24,135
[SPEAKER_02]: The rules are the rules, Mr. President.

1956
02:19:24,155 --> 02:19:26,715
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be rules, but you know something, Mr. President?

1957
02:19:26,955 --> 02:19:28,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be a little bit logical here.

1958
02:19:28,276 --> 02:19:28,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Read the rule.

1959
02:19:28,856 --> 02:19:29,796
[SPEAKER_02]: No report of a committee.

1960
02:19:30,088 --> 02:19:33,393
[SPEAKER_02]: shall be received unless agreed to and a committee actually assembled.

1961
02:19:33,633 --> 02:19:35,136
[SPEAKER_02]: The committee was actually assembled.

1962
02:19:35,216 --> 02:19:36,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the transportation committee.

1963
02:19:37,203 --> 02:19:38,143
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't a committee of the whole.

1964
02:19:38,464 --> 02:19:39,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Read rule 35, OK?

1965
02:19:40,264 --> 02:19:40,865
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what took place.

1966
02:19:40,885 --> 02:19:41,585
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll read rule 35A.

1967
02:19:41,605 --> 02:19:48,048
[SPEAKER_09]: The council presidents shall review all committee papers in a committee of the whole meeting, which hasn't happened yet, Mr. President.

1968
02:19:48,068 --> 02:19:48,788
[SPEAKER_09]: It most certainly has.

1969
02:19:48,908 --> 02:19:59,192
[SPEAKER_09]: And I personally, based upon the plethora of information that the gentleman's given us, based upon the information that the gentleman's provided with us, I'd like to do a little bit more research, because there might be some questions that I have, Mr. Brown.

1970
02:19:59,212 --> 02:20:01,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, maybe if you came into the meeting, you would have been able to understand what was going on.

1971
02:20:01,493 --> 02:20:02,754
[SPEAKER_09]: That wouldn't have changed anything.

1972
02:20:03,094 --> 02:20:04,195
[SPEAKER_09]: That wouldn't have changed anything.

1973
02:20:04,396 --> 02:20:05,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1974
02:20:06,098 --> 02:20:13,026
[SPEAKER_16]: We are going to, yes, we're going to wish everybody a happy Thanksgiving.

1975
02:20:13,366 --> 02:20:14,287
[SPEAKER_16]: Move on the paper.

1976
02:20:14,587 --> 02:20:16,470
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not going to rule on this paper tonight.

1977
02:20:16,590 --> 02:20:16,830
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

1978
02:20:17,130 --> 02:20:18,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I need to study it.

1979
02:20:18,672 --> 02:20:20,194
[SPEAKER_02]: I challenge the chair, Mr. President.

1980
02:20:21,138 --> 02:20:21,798
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite obvious.

1981
02:20:21,859 --> 02:20:30,224
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means that every single committee that meets and comes to this council floor and submits a report and submits a report and the council votes on it.

1982
02:20:30,544 --> 02:20:32,285
[SPEAKER_02]: That's those have all been illegal.

1983
02:20:32,305 --> 02:20:32,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what we're saying?

1984
02:20:33,226 --> 02:20:34,307
[SPEAKER_02]: They've all been not right.

1985
02:20:35,007 --> 02:20:43,032
[SPEAKER_02]: That means every single committee that's gone and had a committee report and came back to this council, read the committee report and the council voted on it was done wrong.

1986
02:20:43,072 --> 02:20:43,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are we doing this?

1987
02:20:43,873 --> 02:20:45,454
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you even have a committee for?

1988
02:20:45,494 --> 02:20:46,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1989
02:20:46,955 --> 02:20:49,817
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the explanation of the committee report is informational.

1990
02:20:50,359 --> 02:20:52,521
[SPEAKER_09]: for the other members of the council who don't serve on that committee.

1991
02:20:53,161 --> 02:20:56,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when we meet on the committee... The committee report was brought forward like it always is.

1992
02:20:56,544 --> 02:20:57,445
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I wasn't talking.

1993
02:20:57,465 --> 02:20:58,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I rest my case.

1994
02:20:58,346 --> 02:20:59,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to be interrupted repeatedly.

1995
02:21:00,047 --> 02:21:01,208
[SPEAKER_09]: I rest my case, Mr. President.

1996
02:21:01,889 --> 02:21:02,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

1997
02:21:02,509 --> 02:21:03,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Be an obstructionist all you want.

1998
02:21:04,150 --> 02:21:04,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Move the paper, Mr. President.

1999
02:21:04,991 --> 02:21:05,812
[SPEAKER_02]: There's nothing wrong.

2000
02:21:05,852 --> 02:21:09,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Either that or change all the rules around here, because these committees mean absolutely nothing.

2001
02:21:09,435 --> 02:21:09,795
[SPEAKER_02]: I've read that.

2002
02:21:09,815 --> 02:21:10,816
[SPEAKER_02]: You've opposed it in every step.

2003
02:21:10,836 --> 02:21:12,157
[SPEAKER_02]: These mean absolutely nothing.

2004
02:21:12,818 --> 02:21:13,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Move the paper, Mr. President.

2005
02:21:20,413 --> 02:21:21,300
[SPEAKER_16]: Why don't we take a recess?

2006
02:24:02,527 --> 02:24:16,695
[SPEAKER_16]: In effect, uh, there is no agreement, uh, or ability for the, uh, um, committee to, uh, retract a part of what it agreed to, uh, report out since it's not been reconvened nor is its membership present.

2007
02:24:17,375 --> 02:24:26,040
[SPEAKER_16]: So therefore the questions that the motion is that the following questions be asked and those questions were enumerated.

2008
02:24:26,480 --> 02:24:29,642
[SPEAKER_16]: by the councilor and taken down by the clerk.

2009
02:24:30,483 --> 02:24:32,604
[SPEAKER_16]: On that motion, all those in favor?

2010
02:24:32,884 --> 02:24:33,024
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

2011
02:24:33,404 --> 02:24:34,185
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

2012
02:24:35,606 --> 02:24:36,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2013
02:24:36,686 --> 02:24:37,987
[SPEAKER_16]: Happy Thanksgiving again.

2014
02:24:38,908 --> 02:24:45,752
[SPEAKER_16]: And the records of the meeting of November 17th were presented to Councilor Caraviello for inspection.

2015
02:24:46,212 --> 02:24:49,214
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're grateful before we do the records.

2016
02:24:50,475 --> 02:24:52,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Camuso, yes.

2017
02:24:52,937 --> 02:24:53,477
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think

2018
02:24:54,921 --> 02:25:02,827
[SPEAKER_07]: I posed this to the body in the form of a resolution, having a committee of the whole and take up all papers that are in all subcommittees.

2019
02:25:03,047 --> 02:25:06,390
[SPEAKER_07]: We have stuff in there from 2007 that just never dealt with it.

2020
02:25:07,631 --> 02:25:08,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they could have been acted upon.

2021
02:25:08,892 --> 02:25:10,893
[SPEAKER_07]: They could have been acted upon, exactly.

2022
02:25:10,973 --> 02:25:11,714
[SPEAKER_07]: I looked at the list.

2023
02:25:11,854 --> 02:25:19,981
[SPEAKER_07]: So in other words, every time the clerk prints out the city council tracking sheet for subcommittees, committees of the whole, it's just wasting ink and paper.

2024
02:25:20,401 --> 02:25:21,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, I think that this,

2025
02:25:22,107 --> 02:25:31,015
[SPEAKER_07]: time where, especially with two members of the council are moving on into retirement, it would be the appropriate time to clean up the business beforehand of this particular council.

2026
02:25:31,956 --> 02:25:35,039
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's a good idea, but whatever the council wishes.

2027
02:25:36,200 --> 02:25:38,381
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we want to keep stuff in certain committees, you keep it there.

2028
02:25:38,562 --> 02:25:40,523
[SPEAKER_07]: But there is stuff that works itself out.

2029
02:25:40,944 --> 02:25:46,729
[SPEAKER_09]: I think procedurally, Mr. President, papers need to report themselves out of committee, have to be reported out of committee to meet the committee of the whole, right?

2030
02:25:46,769 --> 02:25:49,031
[SPEAKER_09]: So they'd be in committee until the subcommittee reports them out.

2031
02:25:49,657 --> 02:25:51,618
[SPEAKER_07]: So everybody has to call a subcommittee report.

2032
02:25:51,638 --> 02:25:53,539
[SPEAKER_07]: So the subcommittee meetings would have to be called.

2033
02:25:54,179 --> 02:26:02,383
[SPEAKER_09]: Or each individual subcommittee chair can perform an audit of the items that are in their committee, and then report back to the council what's sleeping and what's alive.

2034
02:26:02,483 --> 02:26:05,784
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we can meet as a committee of the whole and discuss what's going on from there.

2035
02:26:06,345 --> 02:26:09,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, whatever procedurally we decide to do.

2036
02:26:09,126 --> 02:26:11,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think procedure is important, Mr. President.

2037
02:26:11,267 --> 02:26:13,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Procedure is established so that we're open and transparent.

2038
02:26:14,237 --> 02:26:20,921
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree 100%, but I also think we have to do whatever the proper procedure is to clear up the council tracking resolution.

2039
02:26:21,081 --> 02:26:22,361
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 17 pages long.

2040
02:26:22,861 --> 02:26:25,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I say that in a funny fashion.

2041
02:26:25,423 --> 02:26:31,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not 17 pages, but it's quite lengthy, and it's stuff that we're talking about buildings that don't even exist in our community anymore.

2042
02:26:32,226 --> 02:26:36,088
[SPEAKER_07]: We get papers, and they're talking about the DPW water building that burned down.

2043
02:26:36,148 --> 02:26:37,549
[SPEAKER_07]: The water building is no longer there.

2044
02:26:40,891 --> 02:26:43,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever the proper procedure is, I think we should address all of it.

2045
02:26:44,282 --> 02:26:49,706
[SPEAKER_16]: And a lot of the ones that are on Committee of the Whole, although they may not have been reported out, have all been acted upon otherwise.

2046
02:26:52,147 --> 02:26:53,648
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, you guys deal with it next year.

2047
02:26:53,708 --> 02:26:58,772
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if it's been in committee since 2007, chances are nothing's going to happen with it anyway.

2048
02:26:59,072 --> 02:26:59,692
[SPEAKER_09]: That is true.

2049
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:02,214
[SPEAKER_20]: We can be cognizant of it any time we call a committee meeting.

2050
02:27:02,234 --> 02:27:04,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to do it on a Friday night?

2051
02:27:05,777 --> 02:27:11,120
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we can do it this Thursday, 10 o'clock, instead of going to Medford-Hormel Stadium.

2052
02:27:13,141 --> 02:27:13,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Vice President?

2053
02:27:14,609 --> 02:27:16,530
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just saying we can do it in stages.

2054
02:27:16,610 --> 02:27:21,472
