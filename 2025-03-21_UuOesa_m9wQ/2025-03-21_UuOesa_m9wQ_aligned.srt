1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,672
The 34th regular meeting of the Medford City Council will be called to order.

2
00:00:03,692 --> 00:00:04,753
The clerk will call the roll.

3
00:00:08,356 --> 00:00:09,417
Vice President Caviello.

4
00:00:09,437 --> 00:00:09,597
Present.

5
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:12,339
Councilor DelaRusso.

6
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:12,819
Present.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,320
Councilor Knight.

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:14,580
Present.

9
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:16,242
Councilor Long and Kern.

10
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:16,422
Present.

11
00:00:17,222 --> 00:00:17,883
Councilor Marks.

12
00:00:17,903 --> 00:00:18,283
Present.

13
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,404
Councilor Penta.

14
00:00:19,424 --> 00:00:19,604
Present.

15
00:00:20,925 --> 00:00:21,646
President Camuso.

16
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:22,386
Present.

17
00:00:22,466 --> 00:00:25,028
Seven members present, please rise to salute our flag.

18
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:29,852
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

19
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:40,831
to the Republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:40,891 --> 00:00:42,431
Item 14-753, offered by Councilor Penta.

21
00:00:43,052 --> 00:00:57,816
Be it resolved that in the interest of public and residential disclosure, the $25,000 earmarked for public street bicycle roadway use be publicly presented in order that the community has an opportunity to review it for any issues that it may concern.

22
00:00:58,056 --> 00:00:58,636
Councilor Penta.

23
00:00:59,183 --> 00:01:06,109
Mr. President, members who might be watching, and I understand I see out there there are members of the Bicycle Commission here, and I'm glad that they're here tonight.

24
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:14,936
I received quite a few emails from interested people, I believe members of your commission as well, as it relates to this particular issue.

25
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:26,165
Last week when this was presented to us as part of the million dollar plus wish list of the mayor of Medford, and this issue had been brought up, I believe your chairperson, Mr. Kulik, was here.

26
00:01:27,013 --> 00:01:35,515
And there was some remarks made as it related to where we would be going with this $25,000 money that's going to be earmarked for that.

27
00:01:35,855 --> 00:01:45,257
Um, I'm also glad I see the chief of police in the audience too, because there's a request to you to attend to one of their meetings as it relates to bicycle safety.

28
00:01:45,657 --> 00:01:46,717
And I see you nodding your head.

29
00:01:46,737 --> 00:01:47,837
So we're just going to work on the date.

30
00:01:48,458 --> 00:01:50,638
The bottom line to all of this is basically the following.

31
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:54,759
Um, I received phone calls subsequent to last Tuesday's meeting as it relates to

32
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:59,151
Where exactly are these bike lanes going to go?

33
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:02,552
In front of what homes in the residential areas?

34
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:10,896
There was a concern in some of your emails that you folks sent back and forth yesterday and today, over the weekend too, I suppose.

35
00:02:11,436 --> 00:02:12,697
You talked about Salem Street.

36
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:14,858
Some people wanted, some people didn't want Salem Street.

37
00:02:15,458 --> 00:02:24,202
Streets that had a high visibility of traffic and use of traffic, which might either interfere with the public safety or impede public safety as it relates to bicycles.

38
00:02:24,915 --> 00:02:34,781
So this is actually wanting to get a clear definition of what exact streets these bicycle lanes are going to be proposed for.

39
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:41,264
And by numerical number, business or residential, where would they be located?

40
00:02:42,185 --> 00:02:52,731
And I believe an explanation coming forward as it relates to if in fact a bicycle lane is going to be in front of either a business or a residential home,

41
00:02:53,965 --> 00:03:00,586
Does that precede anyone having the ability to park there, as they presently do, or not to park there, or whatever it might be?

42
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,587
We all know that bicycles are here to stay.

43
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:05,087
It's the advent of the future.

44
00:03:05,927 --> 00:03:10,188
Somerville has done a great job in moving this issue forward, so has the city of Boston.

45
00:03:11,808 --> 00:03:14,929
Medford's a little bit behind the times, but finally they're catching up.

46
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:20,570
And we have to recognize the fact that bikes are here, and bike lanes are here, and they are needed.

47
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,810
But I just think it's having a program

48
00:03:23,501 --> 00:03:27,344
that's identified, specified, location-wise.

49
00:03:28,005 --> 00:03:52,123
And the other part of the concern was when a bicycle lane comes to an end and it finds itself either back out into the main thoroughfare or what have you, what's an explanation just are and what is the right-of-way privileges that a biker would have as compared to a motorist driving in the same lane?

50
00:03:53,005 --> 00:04:06,716
So with that being said, I don't know who really can answer it other than I believe whoever is going to make this determination, where the locations are going to be, where the business locations are going to be and the other questions.

51
00:04:07,337 --> 00:04:20,647
I know the bicycle commission, you folks, you know, you're new at it and it's, I guess you're trying to identify all of these things, but I don't know who's going to make this determination in the city as to how it's going to be implemented.

52
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:45,316
for the Sharos, the $25,000, its locations, and bicycle safety, because that would be the major concern that I would have, that the bicyclists with your roadways or on your roadways, you know, are protected via public safety, but at the same time, if they're going to be at specific locations, just how are they going to be managed and who is going to manage them?

53
00:04:46,116 --> 00:04:49,937
So that is the resolution, Mr. President, and I would like to forward that back

54
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,512
to the city administration with those questions to be answered.

55
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,915
On the motion of Councillor Penta, all those in favor?

56
00:04:56,935 --> 00:04:57,755
Roll call vote, Mr. President.

57
00:04:57,815 --> 00:04:58,956
Roll call has been requested.

58
00:05:01,278 --> 00:05:03,239
Before the roll is called, name and address for the record.

59
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:04,860
Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

60
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:17,529
And I just want to say, I read it on the email system, I don't know if it was the Medford Mass Group or something, that they were thinking about putting a bike path on Salem Street.

61
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:20,266
and I think that Salem Street is an unreasonable request.

62
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:23,088
It is a highly dense populated area.

63
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:24,689
You have a lot of shift workers.

64
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:34,295
I don't know if you know what it feels like to work 11 to 7 or 3 to 11 and then get stuck on the night shift and you're driving home at 7 o'clock in the morning.

65
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:38,378
You have people driving on medications.

66
00:05:38,418 --> 00:05:39,959
You have people putting makeup on.

67
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:43,908
You have people drinking coffee, I'm guilty of that.

68
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:46,830
You have people eating while they're driving.

69
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,291
You have a lot of distracted drivers.

70
00:05:48,371 --> 00:05:51,672
Salem Street is a highly, highly trafficked area.

71
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:56,935
It's very populated and I think it would be very dangerous to have a bike path on that road.

72
00:05:57,315 --> 00:06:00,656
Winthrop Street is a different thing, or some of the other roads, that's fine.

73
00:06:01,216 --> 00:06:05,277
This is a very dangerous area to have a bike path.

74
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:06,697
You have the buses.

75
00:06:06,717 --> 00:06:11,138
I don't know if you've ever traveled, but the other thing is that the biker might not get hurt.

76
00:06:12,178 --> 00:06:18,340
I can see myself actually trying to dodge a biker and hitting another car, because you see the biker.

77
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,740
So you have to be prepared.

78
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,661
The biker may not get hurt, but you might bump into another car, trying to swerve to avoid the biker.

79
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:27,585
because the roads are so tight.

80
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:39,189
So I just want to make everybody fully aware how dangerous that would be to have bike paths on the Salem Street, unless you have more control or you change the whole thing, you make it a one way.

81
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:45,271
I don't know what you got to do to make the bikes safe, but I just think it's a too dense of an area to put bikes.

82
00:06:45,691 --> 00:06:46,012
Thank you.

83
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:47,312
Thank you.

84
00:06:47,372 --> 00:06:47,872
Councilor Knight.

85
00:06:48,412 --> 00:06:49,713
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

86
00:06:50,836 --> 00:07:01,542
In looking at the packet that we have this morning, I have noticed that the Bicycle Commission and members thereof who are here present this evening have provided us with some information relative to where it is they would like to see these bike paths.

87
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:11,168
And we also have a correspondence from the Mayor's Office, and this correspondence would indicate that the Traffic and Parking Commission will have the actual oversight authority over the bicycle lanes.

88
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:23,324
I think one of the important components of this funding that we released last week, Mr. President, is the fact that it's also going to be used to provide educational information and educational materials to the residents in the city of Medford so that they understand that these cyclists do have rights.

89
00:07:23,785 --> 00:07:26,227
And part of those rights involve sharing the road, Mr. President.

90
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,288
Again, I think this is a great initiative.

91
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:29,810
I think this is a step in the right direction.

92
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,174
I think it's forward thinking on behalf of the administration, on behalf of this council, to vote to release this money, Mr. President.

93
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:37,816
I stand in support of bicycle lanes here in the city of Medford.

94
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:43,290
I'd like to thank the members of the bicycle commission who took time out of their busy schedule during this holiday season to come out here this evening.

95
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:44,010
Thank you very much.

96
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,231
Thank you.

97
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:45,912
Counselor Penta.

98
00:07:50,935 --> 00:08:01,943
Um, I just noticed that on my desk, Mr. President, um, an amendment to this, um, resolution that's being offered here by the, uh, bicycle advisory commission.

99
00:08:02,604 --> 00:08:07,007
And, um, I appreciate the fact that you folks, I'm just getting it right now.

100
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:07,247
I just,

101
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:08,632
seeing it on my desk.

102
00:08:08,692 --> 00:08:11,274
So if other people go out earlier than that, I don't know.

103
00:08:11,694 --> 00:08:12,554
I'm just seeing it now.

104
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:20,798
But, um, part of the, um, part of the issue that's being presented, um, does indicate certain locations, but it doesn't give street addresses.

105
00:08:20,818 --> 00:08:33,384
And I think that's important to know if we could put street addresses on here that identify where on the particular roadways, for example, when you say place that road from Winthrop street to West Bedford square, bike lanes, the sharrows, depending upon measured road width.

106
00:08:34,044 --> 00:08:36,986
Um, I, I'm also getting the idea that, um,

107
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,622
This $25,000, it's inclusive for what you want to do with the bicycles.

108
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:44,664
This is a proposal, is that what you're saying?

109
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:54,129
And if this has to be approved by the Traffic Commission, as Councilor Knight has alluded to, I don't know.

110
00:08:54,149 --> 00:09:00,073
I really don't know if the Traffic Commission has other ideas where the bike lanes want to go.

111
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:02,094
I mean, is it your call?

112
00:09:02,174 --> 00:09:04,095
I mean, explain this to us.

113
00:09:04,135 --> 00:09:07,477
Maybe you can come up here and explain this because this is all new to me and I just want to make sure.

114
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:13,568
what gets presented before the traffic commission is as accurate as can be for them to vote on.

115
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,162
Bruce Kulik, Grove Street.

116
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:31,788
I would like to say thank you to the council for considering this matter.

117
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:40,393
I think it is very important and that I'm here primarily tonight to listen to hear what any objections there might be or what other ideas people might have.

118
00:09:41,353 --> 00:09:46,297
I believe, as has been pointed out by Councilor Knight, you have the information about where the proposals were.

119
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:54,403
And from that, that should be, I believe, sufficient for most people to understand whether or not their area is affected.

120
00:09:55,423 --> 00:09:58,205
And you had a primary question, actually, that you would ask.

121
00:09:58,225 --> 00:09:59,907
What was the question you asked?

122
00:10:00,667 --> 00:10:02,669
The question on number one, I just got this tonight.

123
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:03,469
I found it on my desk.

124
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:06,912
So I did not have this over the weekend or this morning to review it.

125
00:10:07,452 --> 00:10:08,793
So this is last minute.

126
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:10,212
being presented here.

127
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,333
I can't be responsible for that.

128
00:10:11,353 --> 00:10:12,714
I don't know when the mayor dispatched them.

129
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:13,795
Well, I'm just telling you.

130
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:14,475
Okay.

131
00:10:15,056 --> 00:10:15,856
Um, that's number one.

132
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:34,508
Number two, um, you, you, you're making proposals here, like you say, from Winthrop street, uh, from Winchester lane line to approximately Wildwood road bike lanes on each side, um, by taking bike roads, for example, on either side of Winthrop street, that's going to shrink the side of the street.

133
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:38,291
That's going to shrink the width of the street for vehicular traffic.

134
00:10:38,685 --> 00:10:46,731
And I'm just wondering, once again, something like that, when the traffic commission sees that, is that going to be something that's going to be acceptable to them?

135
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:52,856
Because to some degree, having bike lanes on one side of the street is not the same as having it on two sides of the street.

136
00:10:52,876 --> 00:11:00,582
For example, if you are leaving Ball Square and going to Powder House Square, their bike lane is on the right-hand side of the street, not on the left-hand side of the street.

137
00:11:01,143 --> 00:11:03,385
But that's not the issue.

138
00:11:03,425 --> 00:11:04,325
The issue is simply this.

139
00:11:04,826 --> 00:11:07,808
You've given five indications here, where you would like to put it.

140
00:11:08,277 --> 00:11:18,483
Um, I think it would be more appropriate or better for you folks when you submit this, uh, for the request to the traffic commission that you identify the street addresses, uh, beginning and ending.

141
00:11:19,123 --> 00:11:24,767
And second of all, um, where these bike lanes and, and they converge back up to the main street.

142
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:29,870
Um, I'd like to know how that's going to take place, how it's going to get done.

143
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,651
I just, I guess I can't see it in my mind.

144
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,073
You're in a bike lane and all of a sudden the bike lane ends.

145
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,291
Where does the bike go back up to the street?

146
00:11:37,311 --> 00:11:50,501
I recommend that you might visit Arlington or Somerville, maybe Cambridge, and you can see how it's applied at those places, which are done basically to DOT and AASHTO standards, which are both adopted by the state.

147
00:11:53,123 --> 00:11:55,025
Point of information, Councilor Lungo-Kern.

148
00:11:55,245 --> 00:11:56,926
Thank you, President Camuso.

149
00:11:57,587 --> 00:11:59,188
It is just also a suggestion.

150
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:02,951
In Medford, they just put a bike lane right near my home on Highland Ave.

151
00:12:03,231 --> 00:12:04,212
Very nicely done.

152
00:12:04,232 --> 00:12:05,333
It goes

153
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:11,978
probably two or three blocks and then stops the way it's... I believe that's a DCR road.

154
00:12:12,278 --> 00:12:19,862
It's a DCR road, but it is Medford and I mean, I think that's exactly what, close to what we want to do in Medford.

155
00:12:19,982 --> 00:12:30,187
And I think these streets probably are some of our widest streets, Playstead Road, Boston Ave, Winthrop Street, College Ave, I think they're some of our widest streets.

156
00:12:30,227 --> 00:12:31,528
I think they're good recommendations.

157
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:33,142
by the Bicycle Commission.

158
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:33,522
Good start.

159
00:12:33,543 --> 00:12:35,463
I expect full vetting of the Traffic Commission as well.

160
00:12:35,643 --> 00:12:36,163
Absolutely.

161
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:37,124
For that information.

162
00:12:38,444 --> 00:12:39,044
Councillor Knight.

163
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:41,685
Thank you, Mr. President.

164
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:43,926
Mr. Kulik, if you don't mind.

165
00:12:44,086 --> 00:12:50,128
I think it's important to point out that cyclists do have a right to ride in the street, correct?

166
00:12:50,148 --> 00:12:50,588
Yes, that's correct.

167
00:12:50,608 --> 00:12:54,710
And maybe you could share with us a little bit about your experience and knowledge of the law relative to

168
00:12:55,505 --> 00:12:59,189
You know, cyclist rights on the street and a roadway, similar to what you discussed with me last week.

169
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,313
Cyclists are basically just like any other traffic.

170
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:06,438
They have the exact same rights as all motor vehicles, except for being on interstate highways.

171
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:13,667
That means that you're responsible for merging with bicycle traffic just as you would any other slower traffic that might be there.

172
00:13:14,681 --> 00:13:16,322
to address Councilor Penta's point.

173
00:13:17,022 --> 00:13:25,246
Any two lanes come together, whoever is in front at that point in time has the right of way and the person behind has to yield or overtake safely.

174
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:26,967
Thank you.

175
00:13:28,428 --> 00:13:29,608
Councilor Penta.

176
00:13:29,908 --> 00:13:31,109
Bruce, whoop.

177
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:34,090
I was gonna put you back on the seat.

178
00:13:35,111 --> 00:13:40,133
As we discussed at the last meeting that you had, bicyclists are also supposed to observe the rules of the road as well.

179
00:13:40,594 --> 00:13:43,415
Handed notifications, clothing, lighting,

180
00:13:44,671 --> 00:13:45,471
and all of that, so.

181
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:53,999
There's no regulation about clothing at this point, other than your possibility of adding something to the state, which you brought up a couple of weeks ago.

182
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,622
However, there is no currently anything that requires clothing.

183
00:13:57,642 --> 00:14:09,593
There are reflection standards that need to be met, lighting standards, and of course, you're right, part of the responsibility of being on the road is to follow the same rules of the road that all other traffic does as well.

184
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:18,506
Now you also, Bruce, at the very last page, I just noticed you say final recommendations will be made after we had a chance to review the actual site conditions.

185
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:23,830
So am I understanding that your commission hasn't reviewed all of this yet by site?

186
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:25,591
That's correct.

187
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:27,692
So these are nothing...

188
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:33,683
We've reviewed them through Google images and other photographs that we have.

189
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:42,366
Um, there are some places where we'd be interested in finding actual road widths, um, before we would make any recommendation to the traffic commission or to the city about.

190
00:14:43,086 --> 00:14:45,747
So it's possible that some of these locations can change.

191
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:46,367
Certainly.

192
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:57,431
Well, if the, um, I don't know if the news media is here or not, but I would suggest that before, um, these five locations that you've identified,

193
00:14:58,293 --> 00:14:58,933
are put out there.

194
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:00,154
These are subject to change.

195
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:02,055
They could be added to or subtracted.

196
00:15:02,255 --> 00:15:03,835
And I think that's what the concern is.

197
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:08,858
You know, where are they going to go, and do they follow the issues that I presented you before?

198
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:27,886
So, Mr. Clark, Mr. Clark, on this particular paper, I'd like to have it referred to Mr. Kulik and his commission, but more importantly, I guess, to the Traffic Commission, that if, in fact, no matter what they recommend, whether it's these five locations or anything more added or subtracted,

199
00:15:28,207 --> 00:15:32,150
that they give the actual addresses inclusive of where they begin, where they end.

200
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:38,515
So as anybody in these particular locations are perfectly aware of where the bike lanes go, number one.

201
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:44,440
And number two, does a bike lane supersede someone's availability to park on the street?

202
00:15:44,801 --> 00:15:45,181
I don't know.

203
00:15:45,481 --> 00:15:46,122
I can't answer that.

204
00:15:47,082 --> 00:15:47,443
I don't know.

205
00:15:47,983 --> 00:15:50,505
On the motion of councilor Penta, councilor Marks.

206
00:15:51,606 --> 00:15:52,887
Thank you, Mr. President.

207
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,168
I just had a side question.

208
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:56,110
Bruce, I hate to get you up there again,

209
00:15:58,706 --> 00:15:59,928
especially with no direct route.

210
00:15:59,948 --> 00:16:10,881
I will say this is one of the strangest city council meetings I've been to.

211
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:11,602
Nice and festive.

212
00:16:14,247 --> 00:16:23,053
Bruce, as the commission looked at the number of bicycle racks currently in the community, do we have bicycle racks in most of the downtown?

213
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:32,159
No, in fact, that's another area that we are considering a recommendation to the city, which would be at some point the purchase of additional bicycle parking facilities.

214
00:16:32,979 --> 00:16:39,884
Many of the recent private developments that have gone in have put in very good modern racks, and we really appreciate that.

215
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:51,794
But within the squares, for example, that does become a question because nothing is discouraging like going to find a place to park your bike and not really having a place when you want to go to a merchant that you want to buy something.

216
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:57,499
So I think it is important that there be sufficient bicycle parking in the squares as well as

217
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,540
automobile parking.

218
00:17:00,101 --> 00:17:02,362
So that will be part of a future recommendation?

219
00:17:02,922 --> 00:17:05,383
At some point once we've, you know, there's a lot of work to do.

220
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:11,186
And, uh, as it's been pointed out, we're all volunteers and you know, we get, get done what we can get done.

221
00:17:11,206 --> 00:17:13,647
But that is one of the ideas we have for future recommendations.

222
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:14,367
Sure.

223
00:17:14,987 --> 00:17:27,813
And just my other question was, uh, I work in Boston and, uh, with their bike racks, uh, I noticed that, uh, some bicycle repair kits that are somehow affixed to the racks.

224
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:28,053
Correct.

225
00:17:28,443 --> 00:17:38,554
And they have basic wrenches and other small pumps and just some tools that I guess bicyclists could find helpful to have along their trails.

226
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:41,497
Is that something also that the commission would consider?

227
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:44,709
having maybe a few of these sprinkled throughout the city?

228
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:49,091
That would be if it passes muster with all the people that have financial control.

229
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:52,612
I mean, obviously it's an extra, an extra item, but it certainly would be useful.

230
00:17:53,052 --> 00:17:53,232
Right.

231
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:57,254
Uh, you know, bike racks, uh, I don't think of that costly.

232
00:17:57,454 --> 00:18:02,456
So I think that should be something that we, as a city of 56,000 people can, uh, can afford to do.

233
00:18:02,936 --> 00:18:05,677
We're building a million dollar peace garden in the square here.

234
00:18:06,017 --> 00:18:08,098
I'm sure we can add some bicycle racks.

235
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:11,267
And I would like to see that as a recommendation from the commission.

236
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:18,711
And, uh, you know, if you need support of the council, I think as you hear the council is very supportive of these initiatives.

237
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:19,472
Thank you.

238
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:20,052
Thank you.

239
00:18:20,072 --> 00:18:21,013
Thanks for all your efforts.

240
00:18:21,193 --> 00:18:21,533
Thank you.

241
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:22,694
Counselor counselor night.

242
00:18:22,994 --> 00:18:23,514
Thank you, Bruce.

243
00:18:23,554 --> 00:18:24,134
Not so fast.

244
00:18:24,235 --> 00:18:29,798
I'm going to bring my bike in here and sit on it more quickly.

245
00:18:30,923 --> 00:18:41,992
We've seen other cities, Cambridge, Somerville, Boston, you've seen articles in the newspaper, you've seen reports online about police actually enforcing the rules of the road and writing tickets to cyclists and stuff like that.

246
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:48,898
I think it's safe to say that Medford in terms of its commitment to the cycling community is a little bit behind some of our neighboring communities.

247
00:18:49,398 --> 00:18:50,539
And I guess my question to you is,

248
00:18:51,155 --> 00:19:01,480
what steps can the council take proactively to be in a position to have a successful rollout of bicycle lanes and also successful enforcement of the rules of the road?

249
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:08,484
And what changes would you like to see take place here in the city that will address some of the concerns that have come up during your commission meetings?

250
00:19:08,504 --> 00:19:16,088
Because from what I can tell you of a rather large commission that meets rather frequently, you have quite a active and involved group of people that are participating on this.

251
00:19:16,108 --> 00:19:20,890
So I'm sure there are a number of great ideas that have been brought up, a number of great ideas that have been hashed out.

252
00:19:21,421 --> 00:19:32,784
And I was wondering maybe if you could provide some direction to this council as to what you'd like to see happen, what might make for a smooth transition, and what might ensure that this idea comes to fruition.

253
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:36,025
And when it does, that we're in the best possible place to succeed.

254
00:19:36,065 --> 00:19:45,587
Well, as part of the educational piece that we're putting forward, as you pointed out, honoring the rules of the road, both by bicyclists and by motorists, is a very important facet.

255
00:19:46,447 --> 00:19:56,693
And to encourage the police department to watch for and enforce both for bicyclists and for motor vehicles, I think would be an important item.

256
00:19:57,454 --> 00:20:02,397
As well as any sort of detailed reporting of any incidents that might occur that involve a bicycle.

257
00:20:02,837 --> 00:20:10,202
That's something which across the state, a lot of times it's varied and there's not as much information as you'd like to see.

258
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:23,287
as far as what might have happened that caused the collision, whether it's something that bicyclists did, something motorists did, that's always, I know it's not always easy to figure out what happened after an incident, but that would be useful.

259
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:24,487
Okay, great.

260
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:25,287
Thank you very much.

261
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:26,468
I appreciate it.

262
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:27,248
Councilor Penta.

263
00:20:27,708 --> 00:20:28,689
Bruce, don't go.

264
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:30,069
We talked about Bice Racks.

265
00:20:30,089 --> 00:20:31,330
I think it was two or three years ago.

266
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,470
It could be even longer.

267
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,971
The city got some kind of a grant for bike racks.

268
00:20:35,371 --> 00:20:40,253
And one of the bike racks they put up there is in the 1th Street parking lot, which is half owned by the city.

269
00:20:40,566 --> 00:20:41,827
And I forget what the second one was.

270
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:44,909
So you may want to check in with, it could have come out of OCD.

271
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,871
It could come out of one of those state grants.

272
00:20:46,891 --> 00:20:51,314
I think that was Ben Everbrook at the time.

273
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,095
And Saving Lives, I think, was the group.

274
00:20:53,516 --> 00:20:58,119
And there were several, I think about a half dozen, put throughout the city in some areas.

275
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:03,183
So maybe you can go back and look into that type of a grant if the city's never reapplied for it or whatever it might be.

276
00:21:03,683 --> 00:21:03,963
OK.

277
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:05,685
That's it.

278
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:06,205
Thank you.

279
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:09,928
On the motion of Councilor Penta, roll call has been requested.

280
00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:20,453
motion is to, uh, send this to the mayor to no, no, I think the original was to send it to the mayor, right?

281
00:21:20,513 --> 00:21:22,193
And then the traffic commission and the bicycle commission.

282
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:22,974
Right.

283
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:24,955
But these are just proposals.

284
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:30,638
These five, whether they're going to add or subtract because as Bruce indicated, uh, these are just recommendations at the present time.

285
00:21:31,058 --> 00:21:37,842
So that would be number one as to what they do recommend the, uh, the exact street address by location.

286
00:21:39,042 --> 00:21:40,203
And second of all, um,

287
00:21:40,948 --> 00:21:49,555
I just don't know if they're in a legitimate spot where somebody can park in front of their business or their home and a parking lane is going to go there.

288
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,877
There's a, who has chief you're here.

289
00:21:52,217 --> 00:21:52,797
Can you answer that?

290
00:21:59,423 --> 00:22:07,369
So the best of my understanding, and I believe it's true, if there is a parking lane there, there will not be parking for the motor vehicle on the street.

291
00:22:08,097 --> 00:22:10,757
because of the white line, they can't go over the white line.

292
00:22:11,158 --> 00:22:15,838
So if it's right there along the curb line for the bike lane, motor vehicles cannot park there.

293
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:22,140
You just couldn't block the bike lane because a person pedaling down and counts as a car, then they have to go out into the free flow of traffic.

294
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,820
I'm totally convinced.

295
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:30,261
I have to say that this is a very, as has been stated here earlier, this is a very organized group.

296
00:22:30,701 --> 00:22:32,141
They've come to our community meetings.

297
00:22:32,201 --> 00:22:35,342
They've already been to a traffic commission meeting and gave us an overview.

298
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:45,129
This was before any of the discussion about the available funding to go forward and having traveled through several surrounding communities.

299
00:22:45,709 --> 00:22:50,253
If it works in Somerville, if it works in Arlington, if it's working in Cambridge, it'll work here.

300
00:22:50,793 --> 00:22:55,798
There'll be nothing new that we'll encounter that we won't be able to deal with.

301
00:22:56,318 --> 00:23:00,541
The biggest issue, as Mr. Kulik had mentioned, is getting the education campaign out there.

302
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:02,463
And as far as the enforcement piece,

303
00:23:02,907 --> 00:23:09,353
We'll certainly be applying to the state, the governor's highway safety Bureau, uh, for funding to help us with the enforcement and education.

304
00:23:10,254 --> 00:23:11,835
So I don't really anticipate.

305
00:23:11,915 --> 00:23:21,924
The question chief is if, if you are putting a bike lane in front of my house, so my business that I have, I have a right to park there, legitimate right to park there.

306
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:26,428
Are you telling me now, if a bike lane goes there, I cannot park there anymore.

307
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:28,888
I guess that's what I'm telling you.

308
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:30,608
Yes.

309
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:38,490
In a business district, if you look in these other communities, they have the parking lane, they have the bicycle lane, and then they have the travel lane.

310
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:52,372
If you have a situation where the road is only so wide and you now have the bicycle lane that extends from the curb line to the width of the next white line for the bicycle lane, parking would not be permitted.

311
00:23:52,872 --> 00:23:55,533
But if parking is permitted there today,

312
00:23:56,414 --> 00:23:59,695
there's a good chance that the bicycle lane will not be allowed.

313
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:03,035
And you'll just have the markings on the, on the main roadway.

314
00:24:03,335 --> 00:24:06,076
And that's, that's the key to, that's the key to my issue here.

315
00:24:06,396 --> 00:24:10,257
I don't know where these five recommendations are right now.

316
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:14,538
And I don't know if any of these find themselves in front of anyone's home.

317
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:24,180
Let's just say, and if that'd be the case, if people have been allowed in the past up until now to park in front of the house without any violation and a bike lane goes in there, I mean,

318
00:24:24,855 --> 00:24:32,298
I don't want to get into a contest over this, you know, you know, that the bike lane should supersede the residential owner, because that's going to be the issue that we're going to be hearing from residents.

319
00:24:32,318 --> 00:24:35,480
You're putting a bike lane in front of my house, but I can park there and I parked there.

320
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,360
I've been able to park there for years.

321
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:43,203
I know one of the main streets that's being discussed is Winthrop street from the Winchester line, uh, coming into Medford.

322
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,892
And right now, I don't think you see anyone parking in front of those homes.

323
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,815
The street is certainly wide enough to accommodate the bicycle lane.

324
00:24:50,855 --> 00:24:55,118
It may even possibly be putting a parking lane if necessary.

325
00:24:55,158 --> 00:24:58,820
But no one parks there today, so I really don't anticipate a problem.

326
00:24:59,721 --> 00:25:02,463
If we're talking Winthrop Street and the hillside, that's a whole different issue.

327
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,343
And no one parks there.

328
00:25:03,363 --> 00:25:04,144
They're not supposed to.

329
00:25:04,484 --> 00:25:05,985
And we get the complaints regularly.

330
00:25:06,045 --> 00:25:13,130
And I know that Councilor Longo-Kern has forwarded them to me on people that are parking up on the sidewalk that are obstructing the way.

331
00:25:14,302 --> 00:25:22,546
that street, I would anticipate the markings would be in the major part of the main part of the roadway that would allow them to travel with automobiles.

332
00:25:23,466 --> 00:25:28,589
You, for example, one of the recommendations here says placed at road from Winthrop street to West Medford square.

333
00:25:28,989 --> 00:25:30,049
It doesn't say right or left.

334
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:31,330
It just says placed at road.

335
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,412
So right now in place that road folks can park in front of their house.

336
00:25:37,813 --> 00:25:37,973
So

337
00:25:38,598 --> 00:25:43,201
If a bike lane goes there, are you telling the residents in that area that they can't park in front of the house?

338
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:46,584
We would never take away something without giving them an opportunity to be heard.

339
00:25:46,824 --> 00:25:56,732
So obviously, if this comes before the traffic commission, the people who are but that way will be notified to come and make their complaint be heard.

340
00:25:57,692 --> 00:26:00,855
I don't anticipate anything like that on place that road.

341
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:02,316
I mean, I think along the

342
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:08,643
the cemetery side and the park side, we probably could accommodate a bicycle lane.

343
00:26:09,023 --> 00:26:16,008
On the other side where it's strictly residential, the markings may be in the middle of the roadway, but I'm not the expert.

344
00:26:16,168 --> 00:26:21,691
I'm waiting on the outcome of this study to tell us what can be done and what should be done.

345
00:26:21,972 --> 00:26:24,693
And this is the concerns that I've received from folks.

346
00:26:26,174 --> 00:26:31,698
Some people don't even have these five locations and they just want to know, is the city going to have bike lanes all over the place?

347
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:33,279
And these are some of the issues and that's just,

348
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:36,245
That's, you know, we've got to discuss it before it becomes a finale.

349
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:38,187
It will be, it will be totally vetted.

350
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:43,411
And again, I just repeat that they're a very organized group and they've been very good for us to work with.

351
00:26:44,072 --> 00:26:46,494
Uh, they certainly do their homework and they come prepared.

352
00:26:48,376 --> 00:26:50,317
Counselor max chief.

353
00:26:50,357 --> 00:26:53,700
I'm not, I'm not sure if this is an appropriate question, but we are on the traffic commission.

354
00:26:54,341 --> 00:27:00,026
Uh, one of the things we struggle with as a council every year is the striping of crosswalks.

355
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:10,839
And my concern is once these bike lanes are put down within a matter of, depending on what they use, historically the city uses paint.

356
00:27:11,479 --> 00:27:21,380
I've been pushing for thermoplastic because it lasts longer, it's highly reflective, and it's a little more costly, but it lasts longer.

357
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:30,322
Who will be responsible for making sure these particular lanes get painted year after year in a timely fashion, unlike the crosswalks?

358
00:27:31,097 --> 00:27:35,864
Well, I think we fall into the same problem that we have with the crosswalks.

359
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:42,753
I mean, someone has to push the button to make that happen, to make sure that the crosswalks and the bicycle lanes are painted.

360
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,477
I'm not an expert, again, with the bicycle lanes.

361
00:27:46,711 --> 00:27:54,096
I'm sure that they know what type of marking should be on the pavement that isn't going to be slippery when it's wet, you know, for the bicyclists.

362
00:27:54,896 --> 00:27:58,239
I think that's more of a problem than it is for automobiles with crosswalks.

363
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:01,761
You know, the thermoplastic would work well on crosswalks.

364
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:10,426
I'm not sure if they'd work as well on bicycle lanes, but again, that's what we're looking to have an expert tell us.

365
00:28:10,486 --> 00:28:11,747
Maybe someone from the commission.

366
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:15,930
Has there been any consideration regarding the maintenance of these particular

367
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:16,869
Bike lanes.

368
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,350
Thank you, Chief.

369
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:33,533
The bike lanes would be put in with whatever paint presumably is used for the rest of the street markings and would have the same maintenance schedule.

370
00:28:34,353 --> 00:28:36,773
And what schedule is that, Bruce?

371
00:28:37,213 --> 00:28:38,474
I couldn't tell you what that is.

372
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:39,374
That's the problem.

373
00:28:39,934 --> 00:28:43,735
Well, can you tell me how often the lines are redone?

374
00:28:44,415 --> 00:28:44,875
Not often.

375
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:46,680
I couldn't tell you that.

376
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:55,426
I just know that you become part of the street and um, unless they're being removed, they would be repainted on whatever schedule the streets are being refreshed.

377
00:28:55,466 --> 00:29:05,454
So maybe as a commission, the commission members can assist us as a community to make sure that the city stays on top of these public safety issues from bike lanes to crosswalks.

378
00:29:06,134 --> 00:29:06,835
It's very important.

379
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:09,356
Um, and they've been neglected over the years.

380
00:29:09,416 --> 00:29:11,418
So I would hate to see them put down one year.

381
00:29:11,783 --> 00:29:14,644
And next year, Bruce, your lane's on physical.

382
00:29:14,664 --> 00:29:19,146
Thermoplastic would certainly be longer wearing, as we've seen on all markings.

383
00:29:20,387 --> 00:29:23,408
There are some paints that are less slippery than others.

384
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:30,751
And generally, that's not an issue, except where the lane is painted with green paint that you may have seen.

385
00:29:30,791 --> 00:29:32,852
If that's done with thermoplastic, that's not a good idea.

386
00:29:33,533 --> 00:29:36,914
Other than that, it's more expensive and longer lasting.

387
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,035
Thank you.

388
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:40,296
Thank you.

389
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:40,876
Councilor Mayne.

390
00:29:41,902 --> 00:29:43,163
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

391
00:29:44,063 --> 00:29:50,647
Again, I'm certainly supportive of the bike lanes and looking at it and seeing the bigger picture and thinking down the line.

392
00:29:50,727 --> 00:29:52,348
I mean, we know these bicycle lanes are coming.

393
00:29:52,428 --> 00:29:56,090
We know that this is probably only going to be the beginning of these bicycle lanes.

394
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:04,415
And I was just wondering if maybe the ultimate vision that the commission has is to try to tie these lanes into the paths in Somerville and the path in Arlington.

395
00:30:04,778 --> 00:30:16,926
So that we can have a safe route for people to traverse from Medford to the Somerville bike path, from Medford to the Arlington bike path, or down the Arlington bike path to Somerville, back from Somerville and through Medford, and right back to where it started.

396
00:30:16,946 --> 00:30:20,589
So again, Mr. President, I'm very supportive of this endeavor.

397
00:30:20,629 --> 00:30:25,572
I think that in looking at the work that they've done in such a short period of time, it's amazing, you know what I mean?

398
00:30:25,612 --> 00:30:30,015
They're really showing that although government's designed to move slowly, it doesn't necessarily have to.

399
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:31,356
Thank you.

400
00:30:31,836 --> 00:30:32,857
Name and address for the record, sir.

401
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:35,995
Dave Adams, 21 Blaze Delaware.

402
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:38,716
I'm also on the bike commission.

403
00:30:40,177 --> 00:30:51,203
As you might see from some of the initial recommendations we had that we are already designing, trying to pick places that will connect to the infrastructure and the networks that are already in existence.

404
00:30:52,324 --> 00:30:57,887
We've had a sort of a preliminary planning session with regional planners where we've

405
00:30:59,375 --> 00:31:07,660
try to sort of get the initial idea of what the main places people want to go to in Medford are and how we could connect between them.

406
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:21,027
It's still in the early stages, but it's definitely part of the plan to try to create connectivity throughout from any place you want to be to the rest of the city and to the surrounding communities.

407
00:31:24,522 --> 00:31:37,088
have you sought any guidance from maybe the Massachusetts Area Planning Council or any other state agencies that have some control over the way that transportation funding is released and that infrastructure improvements are released, or is that still a little bit found on the line for you guys?

408
00:31:37,108 --> 00:31:40,450
I mean, we went from having nothing to having bicycle lanes.

409
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:46,973
Next thing you know, now we're talking about tying it into the Greenway and into the parks and stuff like that, so I can see a big vision and a big picture.

410
00:31:47,313 --> 00:31:49,994
And I was wondering how far along in the process you guys actually are.

411
00:31:50,454 --> 00:31:51,755
We did have a session with

412
00:31:52,632 --> 00:31:56,954
I honestly don't know which exact organization it was, but it was related to MABC.

413
00:31:57,014 --> 00:32:01,537
I'm sure that someone on our infrastructure committee can speak to that more closely.

414
00:32:01,557 --> 00:32:02,257
Awesome.

415
00:32:02,417 --> 00:32:02,697
Thank you.

416
00:32:03,578 --> 00:32:03,898
Thank you.

417
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:06,419
Thank you very much.

418
00:32:06,719 --> 00:32:11,942
And on the motion of Councillor Penta, we're going to have a roll call vote.

419
00:32:12,102 --> 00:32:14,864
And I want to thank you all for your diligent work on this.

420
00:32:14,944 --> 00:32:21,147
And this is going to be a great project that's going to tie in with the transportation infrastructure improvements that are going on

421
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:25,499
that we're all excited about, whether it's the Green Line or some of the other plans in Medford.

422
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:26,499
So thank you very much.

423
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,960
And the clerk will call the roll.

424
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,681
Mr. President, could the clerk read the amendments back before we call the roll?

425
00:32:31,501 --> 00:32:45,687
The amendments refer to the Traffic Commission and the Bicycle Committee to get the exact addresses and locations of the proposals before they are instituted, and also to send it to the city administration to make sure that they're doing the same.

426
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:46,348
Is that correct?

427
00:32:47,608 --> 00:32:51,150
And you want to also have the bike lanes

428
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:57,510
supersede the residential vehicle parking.

429
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:59,091
And you get that Councilor?

430
00:32:59,131 --> 00:33:01,992
What's the final, the question as to whether or not they do it?

431
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:03,533
Whether or not it supersedes.

432
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:04,093
Okay.

433
00:33:06,074 --> 00:33:06,674
Clerk, call the roll.

434
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:07,634
Vice President Caravaglio.

435
00:33:07,654 --> 00:33:07,794
Yes.

436
00:33:08,715 --> 00:33:09,575
Councilor DelaRusso.

437
00:33:09,835 --> 00:33:09,935
Yes.

438
00:33:10,376 --> 00:33:10,936
Councilor Knight.

439
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:11,416
Yes.

440
00:33:11,636 --> 00:33:12,256
Councilor Lockern.

441
00:33:12,316 --> 00:33:12,396
Yes.

442
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:13,417
Councilor Marks.

443
00:33:13,477 --> 00:33:13,637
Yes.

444
00:33:13,977 --> 00:33:14,497
Councilor Penta.

445
00:33:14,517 --> 00:33:14,597
Yes.

446
00:33:15,338 --> 00:33:16,118
President Camuso.

447
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:18,439
Yes, by a vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

448
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:21,060
The motion passes and have a great Thanksgiving.

449
00:33:22,884 --> 00:33:26,266
14-754 offered by Councilor Mox.

450
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:35,550
Be it resolved the most recent meeting regarding the reuse of the Malden hospital be discussed, whereas this will have a negative impact on the surrounding Medford neighborhood.

451
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:36,391
Councilor Mox.

452
00:33:37,331 --> 00:33:38,472
Thank you, Mr. President.

453
00:33:38,512 --> 00:33:49,877
Um, on November 19th, the city of Malden held a public forum, uh, held by, uh, mayor Christensen and several of the city councilors.

454
00:33:50,785 --> 00:33:52,827
in Malden, I believe it was at the Beebe School.

455
00:33:54,168 --> 00:34:08,739
At that particular meeting, they discussed the development proposal to convert the Malden Hospital, which has been closed since 1999, into 398 living units.

456
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:16,805
And the developer that was present and made a presentation was Felsmere Housing Group.

457
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:20,068
And they spoke at the meeting, Mr. President,

458
00:34:20,653 --> 00:34:23,235
about the site itself.

459
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:34,024
They spoke about the 398 living units of which 80 were assisted living apartments.

460
00:34:34,044 --> 00:34:37,126
275 were market rate apartment units.

461
00:34:38,007 --> 00:34:49,616
There were 26 condo units and 17 single family cottages that were being built in the style of Nantucket housing.

462
00:34:50,953 --> 00:35:08,502
Also, they spoke about the barrier that's currently in between the Malden Hospital and many of the Method residents, which has been referred to as a wooden buffer that actually has a brook running through it.

463
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:16,887
And that buffer and wooded area would stay as is under this particular proposal.

464
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:18,408
Also,

465
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:33,487
At the meeting, Mr. President, there were a number of Method residents that were not formally notified, but found out through the grapevine that there was a meeting being held in Malden.

466
00:35:34,308 --> 00:35:41,993
As we all are aware, many Method residents live closer to this particular site than Malden residents.

467
00:35:43,214 --> 00:35:46,917
And the impact of the surrounding area

468
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:57,927
Lund, Grover, Fry, Murray Hill would be just as much if not more than an impact on Malden residents.

469
00:35:58,747 --> 00:36:16,482
And the resolution I want to offer tonight is the first resolution is to make sure that any meeting held regarding the Malden Hospital and the potential reuse and development of the Malden Hospital that the city administration

470
00:36:17,124 --> 00:36:19,766
notify the direct abutters in the area.

471
00:36:20,086 --> 00:36:22,428
That's my first motion, Mr. President.

472
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:30,215
Also at the meeting, there was a conceptual drawing that was showed at the meeting.

473
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:34,778
And the access road is Hospital Road.

474
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:35,839
If you go up the hill, you'll know.

475
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:39,202
If you come on up the hill, Hospital Road is on your right.

476
00:36:39,242 --> 00:36:43,925
That leads you into the back of the Malden Hospital.

477
00:36:44,406 --> 00:36:45,767
And then if you go a little further up,

478
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:59,345
There is Lund Road, and the plan itself calls for the creation of a new street from this particular project, linking it to Lund Road.

479
00:37:00,145 --> 00:37:13,291
And all of us that have been around for some time and the neighbors who have lived there realize that when that area was opened into the Malden Hospital, it was a nightmare for area residents.

480
00:37:14,091 --> 00:37:15,272
There was a concern with

481
00:37:16,514 --> 00:37:19,376
traffic issues, there was a concern with public safety.

482
00:37:19,856 --> 00:37:29,825
At one point, a four-way stop had to be put at that particular area to alleviate some of the concerns of area residents.

483
00:37:30,505 --> 00:37:44,137
I had a discussion with Chief Sacco, and he agreed that the opening of that particular area, which leads into Lund, would have a devastating impact

484
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:45,828
on area residents.

485
00:37:46,729 --> 00:38:08,423
And my second resolution, Mr. President, my second motion, actually, would be to call for an immediate erection of a barrier on the Method side, because right now there's a barrier that was put up by Hallmark Health some years ago, and it's closed.

486
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:12,346
But under these plans, if this proposal goes through,

487
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:21,644
Their barrier will be removed, and they're going to expect having access in and out from their particular development into our Meffitt neighborhood.

488
00:38:22,404 --> 00:38:34,469
And from the residents I spoke with, many homeowners who contacted me just recently regarding this issue, they have grave concerns with reopening that particular area.

489
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:39,751
Also, Mr. President, I find it a little ironic that

490
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:44,083
I realized this is a Malden project.

491
00:38:44,263 --> 00:38:56,473
It's Malden hospital, but part of the surrounding property at Malden hospital is method land and their proposal calls for building 17 single family cottages, as I mentioned.

492
00:38:57,154 --> 00:39:02,138
Um, and nine of the 17 cottages are located on method property.

493
00:39:02,818 --> 00:39:05,701
So those homes would be built that pay taxes to method.

494
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:10,885
There would be method property for all official reasons and not one resident

495
00:39:11,437 --> 00:39:14,339
in the area, and no one from the city administration.

496
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:16,740
Well, not one resident from the area was notified.

497
00:39:17,641 --> 00:39:27,327
As far as I know, the city administration was notified of the meeting, but there was no one there representing our city and safeguarding our neighborhoods, Mr. President.

498
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:35,572
So, on behalf of the neighborhood, I know there's maybe a resident or two that took the time to come up tonight that would like to speak.

499
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:40,395
But on behalf of the residents, Mr. President, I think it's only appropriate that

500
00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:44,680
we take a vote to immediately have a barrier erected there.

501
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,142
And I know years ago, there was a concern about having fire access and so forth.

502
00:39:50,602 --> 00:40:00,265
And that could be accommodated, like many of the other barriers that exist in this community right now, where the fire department has access to get through a barrier and so forth.

503
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:03,907
So I would ask that those two motions be put, Mr. President.

504
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:08,188
And if anyone from the particular area would like to speak here tonight.

505
00:40:09,577 --> 00:40:10,257
Councilor Knight.

506
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:19,665
When you say a barrier, Councilor Mox, what I envision is like coming down Fulton Street on Ridgeway Road, like a couple of Jersey barriers that are up with a sign that says resident accidents only.

507
00:40:19,725 --> 00:40:24,669
What exactly do you mean when you're saying a barrier in terms of, you know, what you'd like to see put up?

508
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:26,530
A gate, a metal gate.

509
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:32,095
I mean, it could be any type of structure, but a gate that could be easily accessed by the fire department.

510
00:40:32,495 --> 00:40:34,617
I know if anyone's interested,

511
00:40:35,388 --> 00:40:37,469
uh, on, uh, I think it's eighth or ninth street.

512
00:40:37,489 --> 00:40:46,756
There's, there's a gate back there that was put up some years ago that the fight department, I think have a lecture electronic gadget when they're heading to gain access in spring road as well, right?

513
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:48,697
There's several of them in the city actually.

514
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:51,198
So I understand it's been accomplished before.

515
00:40:51,919 --> 00:41:04,267
And, um, like I said, uh, this, uh, according to the chief, uh, and he's been around for some time that when this area was open back some years ago, it really posed a public safety concern in the neighborhood.

516
00:41:04,906 --> 00:41:09,748
And I don't believe that our neighborhoods should be turned into a cut through, uh, for traffic.

517
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:16,650
Uh, it's a great way of omitting, uh, getting out and try to go on to, uh, the Felsway from Salem street.

518
00:41:16,991 --> 00:41:21,692
You can cut through the neighborhoods and end up onto the Felsway if you want to go 93 or so forth.

519
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:26,494
And, uh, it really impacts a large, uh, area around our neighborhood.

520
00:41:26,994 --> 00:41:28,575
And I don't think it should be used as a cut through.

521
00:41:29,597 --> 00:41:30,118
Thank you, Councilor.

522
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:31,479
Thank you, Councilors.

523
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,861
I'm Jean Bowen, 17 Lund Road.

524
00:41:35,802 --> 00:41:39,425
I was at the meeting at BB junior high last weekend.

525
00:41:40,586 --> 00:41:46,771
My biggest concern is going to be the traffic because you're going to have probably two to 4,000 people living up there.

526
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:57,279
Um, it's a huge complex that they want to build and you know, the traffic that's up there now, especially in the morning,

527
00:41:57,952 --> 00:42:01,353
from other people coming from the Fellsway that cut through.

528
00:42:02,074 --> 00:42:03,154
The traffic is terrible.

529
00:42:03,214 --> 00:42:05,095
And there was a four-way stop sign there.

530
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:08,076
I think one of them is actually down.

531
00:42:09,016 --> 00:42:13,518
And when Hallmark put that gate up, our fire department can't even go through there anyways.

532
00:42:13,558 --> 00:42:23,562
They have to come down Lund Road and go down Grover Road and come up Hospital Road because the nursing home is in Medford.

533
00:42:24,923 --> 00:42:25,623
And, you know,

534
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,743
A lot of the neighbours have concerns about the traffic and stuff like that because it will be a nightmare.

535
00:42:32,004 --> 00:42:32,384
Thank you.

536
00:42:32,404 --> 00:42:33,785
Thank you.

537
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:37,747
On the motion of Councillor Marks with two amendments, the first amendment and first resolution.

538
00:42:38,048 --> 00:42:39,469
First resolution, not amendment, I'm sorry.

539
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:49,615
That the administration notify the direct of butters of any meeting that the City of Malden is going to have regarding this development and or Medford having a meeting regarding this development.

540
00:42:50,049 --> 00:42:58,354
And number two, the immediate erection of a barrier on the Medford side to protect the integrity of the neighborhood, as was stated by the councilors and the neighbor.

541
00:42:59,234 --> 00:43:00,455
All those in favor, roll call.

542
00:43:03,236 --> 00:43:03,416
Yeah.

543
00:43:03,436 --> 00:43:04,157
Breakaway gate.

544
00:43:04,177 --> 00:43:06,398
The fire department can drive right through if there's a fire.

545
00:43:06,598 --> 00:43:07,379
That's what they're made for.

546
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,580
Councilor Pinto.

547
00:43:10,981 --> 00:43:15,243
If I understood council Marks correctly, the city of Medford was informed about this.

548
00:43:16,391 --> 00:43:33,820
You know if that really is even the case and if the mayor didn't want to go we do have an office community development We do have other department heads that do attend meetings

549
00:43:45,811 --> 00:43:48,213
when the mayor chooses not to attend or he can't attend.

550
00:43:48,873 --> 00:43:54,718
But you indicated that there are 17 single family cottages, nine of which are in the city of Medford.

551
00:43:55,938 --> 00:44:08,267
How can a proposed development take pieces of property in Medford and use it as part of their development and another city and have our city in return and not be there to even discuss and protect it or even have an awareness of this.

552
00:44:08,307 --> 00:44:13,051
And I just think this is a something went wrong in the communication issue here, Mr. President.

553
00:44:13,131 --> 00:44:13,511
And you know,

554
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:22,135
I remember the neighbors many, many years back had this issue when the hospital was operating, if I remember correctly, and the cut-through was going through there.

555
00:44:22,475 --> 00:44:25,777
And then I think, Chief, you were there, and they had to put a stop to it.

556
00:44:26,198 --> 00:44:30,941
And how they put a stop to it was only allowing, by a case of emergency, for a fire truck to go through.

557
00:44:30,981 --> 00:44:31,521
That was it.

558
00:44:32,141 --> 00:44:35,884
And then for some reason, the hospital closed down in 1999, and everything ended.

559
00:44:36,744 --> 00:44:40,407
And now, with this type of a development, which is 399 units, or 399 potential units,

560
00:44:43,451 --> 00:44:47,932
nine of the 17 of these units are going to be in the city of Medford and we weren't even aware of it.

561
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,353
We as a council weren't even notified of it.

562
00:44:50,893 --> 00:44:53,553
Even if we wanted to attend, we didn't have that opportunity.

563
00:44:54,374 --> 00:45:01,055
And if the city, in fact, um, Mr. President, if the city in fact was notified and they sent nobody there, a shame on them because that's, that's embarrassing.

564
00:45:01,435 --> 00:45:06,416
I think to the residents who live in that neighborhood should be represented by city administration.

565
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:10,878
Um, I, I would like to just bump up one more part of your resolution.

566
00:45:11,298 --> 00:45:12,718
I think the offscreen development,

567
00:45:13,149 --> 00:45:18,852
needs to report back to the city of Medford, to the council, just exactly what is the city's position on this development?

568
00:45:19,332 --> 00:45:22,434
Since in fact, Medford pieces of property are part of it.

569
00:45:23,435 --> 00:45:24,275
We're not a party.

570
00:45:24,675 --> 00:45:26,436
We're not a partner to this development.

571
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:29,438
It just, these pieces of property are part of the development.

572
00:45:29,678 --> 00:45:31,099
If I understand you correctly, correct?

573
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,102
And that's what you were told that night at the hearing, at the public meeting.

574
00:45:37,623 --> 00:45:37,923
Okay.

575
00:45:38,623 --> 00:45:41,785
So maybe we should all get a copy of what was being proposed.

576
00:45:43,082 --> 00:45:44,723
cat's out of the bag of the bond right now.

577
00:45:44,803 --> 00:45:48,326
So, uh, you know, nobody from the city was there to even get information.

578
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:52,890
So I think it's time that we do get this information before this project begins to go forward.

579
00:45:53,211 --> 00:46:08,343
Now, the other part of the problem seems to be, could possibly be political in nature because if in fact, uh, if the Malden mayor and the counselor from that particular district was there and they're all on board in this, and now all of a sudden, uh, our questions are going to present a block to maybe the proposal.

580
00:46:08,864 --> 00:46:11,366
Um, does this become a political, um, uh,

581
00:46:11,618 --> 00:46:15,361
Does this become a political issue on who's going to have more power and who's going to have more might?

582
00:46:15,822 --> 00:46:16,823
I'm from the city of Malden.

583
00:46:16,863 --> 00:46:24,430
If 99% of the property is on, is in my territory, who are you from the city of Medford to tell me what you can and can't do in my piece of property?

584
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:29,054
I think the linchpin here is the nine units of the 17 that are in Medford.

585
00:46:29,394 --> 00:46:32,417
And that to me is the issue that I would make a presentation on.

586
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:37,622
Number one, you chief, from what I understand the way the law goes, you could close that road down tomorrow morning if you want.

587
00:46:40,677 --> 00:46:41,878
that cut through tomorrow morning.

588
00:46:41,918 --> 00:46:45,260
If you want you could go there, just close it down in the interest of public safety.

589
00:46:47,101 --> 00:46:52,844
It's been a while since I've been up there, uh, counselor, but I believe the fence is still in place that doesn't allow the cut through.

590
00:46:53,485 --> 00:47:02,670
And in my conversations with counselor marks, I would rather see that fence stay in place, put the fire gate there that to allow emergency vehicles through if need be.

591
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:05,932
Uh, I do not want to see that road opened as it was before.

592
00:47:05,952 --> 00:47:05,992
Um,

593
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:12,527
because it wasn't just the Malden hospital staff that were causing the travel problems with all the cut through.

594
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:19,612
It was an easy commute through that property in the morning to get to route 93 and it was the same in the return trip in the afternoon.

595
00:47:20,233 --> 00:47:25,877
And I'm sure you guys get the, all the complaints that we get about the traffic on Fulton spring Fulton street.

596
00:47:27,658 --> 00:47:28,299
It's bad enough.

597
00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:29,920
Now we don't want to add to that problem.

598
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:34,203
But in fairness, I did speak with chief Morris of the cane of the Malden police.

599
00:47:35,732 --> 00:47:43,033
And what he had told me about this project was that this was very, this was at its very initial stages.

600
00:47:43,053 --> 00:47:48,614
They had only had a few meetings with the city of Malden itself and the developer wanted to meet with the residents.

601
00:47:49,114 --> 00:47:55,596
I believe there was quite a bit of feedback in Malden about this project and that's why they had that meeting at that point in time.

602
00:47:56,536 --> 00:48:03,557
And the developer was ready to walk away if, if, uh, if it wasn't going to work for the community, if it wasn't going to work for the neighborhood,

603
00:48:04,501 --> 00:48:06,422
Medford just needs to be added to that audience.

604
00:48:06,442 --> 00:48:06,982
That's for sure.

605
00:48:07,042 --> 00:48:10,104
But I don't, I don't want to see that opened again.

606
00:48:10,144 --> 00:48:10,844
It was bad enough.

607
00:48:10,864 --> 00:48:17,507
I mean, when you think about Lund road and Grover road, two streets that really probably shouldn't have a stop sign.

608
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:23,850
And now they ended up with a four way stop that tells you the amount of traffic that was there during that time.

609
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:25,251
We don't want to see a repeat of that.

610
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:30,373
And as I said, Murray Hill road, Fulton spring tells have Fulton street, Fern road,

611
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:36,724
We get numerous complaints about the amount of traffic and the speed with which traffic travels on those roads today.

612
00:48:36,804 --> 00:48:38,845
So, we don't want to add to that.

613
00:48:39,406 --> 00:48:42,668
On the three amendments, the Chair recognizes Councillor Lungo-Kern.

614
00:48:43,068 --> 00:48:49,933
And just a brief announcement, we've been notified by Dr. Sheehan that the video feed is not going out on Comcast.

615
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:53,555
We are aware of it and our video technicians in the back are working on it.

616
00:48:56,137 --> 00:48:57,998
I can only tell you what we're reporting.

617
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:58,799
Councillor Lungo-Kern.

618
00:48:58,979 --> 00:48:59,960
Thank you, President Caruso.

619
00:49:00,675 --> 00:49:03,597
Council Penta mentioned what I wanted to bring up.

620
00:49:03,837 --> 00:49:10,280
If we could get a report back from our OCTD department, I too believe they should have been at this meeting.

621
00:49:11,001 --> 00:49:18,205
Whether there's nine or a hundred units in Medford, this is a huge development that abuts our community.

622
00:49:18,325 --> 00:49:21,507
It abuts a number of neighborhoods in that area.

623
00:49:21,887 --> 00:49:29,391
So just wanted to know from Director DiLorenzo, you know, how involved is the city of Medford

624
00:49:29,922 --> 00:49:35,743
and what is the mayor and OCD doing to protect our portion of this property and our neighborhoods?

625
00:49:36,323 --> 00:49:38,264
I agree with everything else that has been said.

626
00:49:38,484 --> 00:49:50,566
Traffic in the area, I live in the area, I drive down Highland, get onto Salem Street to take my kids to school, and you see people taking the right, cutting through the neighborhood as it is, creating a lot of traffic.

627
00:49:50,606 --> 00:49:57,187
Salem Street is already backed up, so development of this size in that neighborhood is gonna create a large amount of traffic.

628
00:49:57,268 --> 00:49:59,128
Let's keep it off Medford streets.

629
00:50:00,756 --> 00:50:04,018
As the chief said, it's already, there's already issues.

630
00:50:04,118 --> 00:50:08,822
So I just really believe that the city of Medford should be on top of this.

631
00:50:08,982 --> 00:50:10,303
We need to be at these meetings.

632
00:50:10,763 --> 00:50:29,096
I'd also ask that the mayor, if he is notified of any future meetings, if he could let the council know of those meetings, whether it's one or two or three of us that can attend, it's at least an extra set of airs that can come back and we can discuss it more on the council and make sure that the city of Medford is doing what we need to do to protect our neighborhoods.

633
00:50:29,787 --> 00:50:30,067
All right.

634
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:45,955
On the main motion and the three amendments, the administration notifies the direct abutters of any meeting in Medford or Malden, immediate erection of the barrier on the Medford side and that OCD and I'm jointing these two.

635
00:50:46,872 --> 00:50:51,815
Resolutions together from Council Lungo Kern in Council of Penta because they sound pretty much alike.

636
00:50:51,855 --> 00:50:53,496
We got in the OCD office Is that okay?

637
00:50:53,576 --> 00:51:02,362
Yep that the OCD office have gives us the city's position on the project and also notify the council of any upcoming meetings That's all night consulate.

638
00:51:02,902 --> 00:51:12,068
I'm constant president commercial I'd like to further amend the paper to have the city councilor invited the developer to a committee of the whole meeting to present his plans to the council and

639
00:51:12,924 --> 00:51:17,107
so that we can ask some questions face to face with the individuals who are putting this plan forward.

640
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:18,188
Further amended.

641
00:51:18,248 --> 00:51:18,808
Great idea.

642
00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:21,050
All those in favor.

643
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:22,711
All those opposed.

644
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:25,273
The roll call has been requested by Councilor Mox.

645
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:26,254
The clerk will call the roll.

646
00:51:27,635 --> 00:51:28,696
Vice President Caviello.

647
00:51:29,396 --> 00:51:30,477
Councilor Tolaruso.

648
00:51:31,197 --> 00:51:31,738
Councilor Knight.

649
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:32,018
Yes.

650
00:51:32,578 --> 00:51:33,359
Councilor McKern.

651
00:51:33,399 --> 00:51:33,599
Yes.

652
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:34,720
Councilor Mox.

653
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,160
Yes.

654
00:51:35,461 --> 00:51:35,961
Councilor Penta.

655
00:51:35,981 --> 00:51:36,061
Yes.

656
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:37,631
President Camuso.

657
00:51:37,691 --> 00:51:37,911
Yes.

658
00:51:37,971 --> 00:51:40,112
By vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

659
00:51:40,412 --> 00:51:41,673
The paper passes as amended.

660
00:51:41,873 --> 00:51:44,895
Thank you for coming out this evening.

661
00:51:45,075 --> 00:51:48,878
Uh, item 14 dash seven, five, five offered by counselor mocks to be resolved.

662
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:56,943
The lack of a cross of a traffic crossing God on Riverside Ave at the entrance to the McGlynn Andrews school be discussed in the interest of public safety.

663
00:51:57,483 --> 00:51:58,063
Counselor mocks.

664
00:51:58,784 --> 00:51:59,845
Thank you, Mr. President.

665
00:52:00,245 --> 00:52:05,188
As we're all aware, uh, the entrance to the McGlynn Andrews school on Riverside Ave is,

666
00:52:05,715 --> 00:52:08,816
a well-traveled area in the morning and the afternoon.

667
00:52:09,356 --> 00:52:13,976
And for the past week and a half, two weeks, there has been no crossing guard there.

668
00:52:14,457 --> 00:52:24,918
There has been a Meffitt police officer sporadically there covering the area, but there are a lot of kids that cross Riverside Ave to get to school.

669
00:52:25,678 --> 00:52:31,900
And I'm not quite sure why we can't have a dedicated person there.

670
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,600
And if they're in the process of hiring someone,

671
00:52:35,108 --> 00:52:40,370
Why don't we have reserves that we can call upon if need be?

672
00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:44,732
And the chief is here, so maybe we can get an answer right away, Mr. President.

673
00:52:45,312 --> 00:52:48,113
Maybe we could have talked about this when we talked about Grover Road.

674
00:52:49,553 --> 00:52:50,574
I don't want to inundate you, Chief.

675
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:51,454
That's all right.

676
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:56,896
We've had some difficulty filling some of the assignments.

677
00:52:57,216 --> 00:53:04,639
The Traffic Supervisors Association, the union that represents the traffic supervisors, on October 30th picked new assignments.

678
00:53:06,636 --> 00:53:10,059
Lapham Street and Riverside Ave at Freedom Way was left open.

679
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:13,382
We're short one traffic supervisor.

680
00:53:13,402 --> 00:53:13,623
We have 24.

681
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:15,304
We need the 25th.

682
00:53:15,344 --> 00:53:16,325
We're in the process.

683
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:22,591
We've had several traffic supervisors out long-term medical leave.

684
00:53:23,512 --> 00:53:25,374
One is returning on December 1st.

685
00:53:26,134 --> 00:53:28,477
Another may be returning probably by January 1st.

686
00:53:30,363 --> 00:53:32,784
That post has been covered every day by a police officer.

687
00:53:32,824 --> 00:53:37,044
They may not be there at the start time, but they're there before 7.30 in the morning, or at 7.30.

688
00:53:39,725 --> 00:53:41,325
I hear them calling off on the assignment.

689
00:53:41,745 --> 00:53:44,766
I'm not there to watch it, but I do hear them calling off on the assignment.

690
00:53:44,786 --> 00:53:47,707
I know they're dispatched there, and they're back there in the afternoon.

691
00:53:48,287 --> 00:53:52,167
As soon as we can fill that post with a permanent traffic supervisor, we will.

692
00:53:52,588 --> 00:53:54,488
But that's the one post that's open right now.

693
00:53:55,254 --> 00:54:00,937
And that was due to the reassignment of traffic supervisors when they picked according to their seniority.

694
00:54:01,457 --> 00:54:06,459
And I think where the lady who had that post did a very good job at that post.

695
00:54:06,879 --> 00:54:13,902
But I think if you speak with her and you speak with those that worked that post before her, that's probably one of the more difficult posts in the city.

696
00:54:15,143 --> 00:54:19,005
When those schools were being built and when they were being discussed to be built,

697
00:54:19,855 --> 00:54:23,377
I recommended traffic lights, not that there were traffic lights alone.

698
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:28,339
We'd also have a traffic supervisor, but definitely there's a need for pedestrian crossing lights there.

699
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:36,824
I know that that's not going to happen because once the buildings are constructed, it's too late, but that's what should have happened back then.

700
00:54:38,464 --> 00:54:43,467
And it was recommended at that time and it didn't make it, didn't make the cut.

701
00:54:43,807 --> 00:54:45,208
So we will fill it.

702
00:54:46,028 --> 00:54:49,210
The short answer version is it will be filled.

703
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:53,061
hopefully quite soon, hopefully by the end of next week.

704
00:54:53,621 --> 00:54:54,722
This week is a short week.

705
00:54:54,742 --> 00:54:57,943
We need to train someone to put them in that post.

706
00:54:58,724 --> 00:55:00,525
Are there plans chief to build up the reserve?

707
00:55:01,045 --> 00:55:01,285
Yes.

708
00:55:01,826 --> 00:55:02,046
Yes.

709
00:55:02,786 --> 00:55:03,607
And that's underway now?

710
00:55:03,807 --> 00:55:04,647
That's underway now.

711
00:55:04,707 --> 00:55:05,948
Letters went out recently.

712
00:55:06,228 --> 00:55:07,769
Uh, we sent out 12 letters.

713
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:08,970
I've got three responses.

714
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:13,332
Uh, so I'll send out the remainder of the list and see what we get.

715
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:18,075
But if those three pass the background check, they'll be put on as reserves.

716
00:55:20,042 --> 00:55:21,242
Thank you, Chief.

717
00:55:22,503 --> 00:55:22,923
Absolutely.

718
00:55:23,963 --> 00:55:25,263
Thank you, Mr. President.

719
00:55:25,483 --> 00:55:27,724
Chief, now you said that you're working on building up the reserves.

720
00:55:27,984 --> 00:55:29,044
How does the reserve system work?

721
00:55:29,084 --> 00:55:30,225
Is there a substitute list?

722
00:55:30,305 --> 00:55:31,545
Is there a per diem rate?

723
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:33,165
How does it work?

724
00:55:33,265 --> 00:55:35,606
They get paid by the day that they work.

725
00:55:36,126 --> 00:55:37,887
They do get a per diem.

726
00:55:38,387 --> 00:55:43,628
In order to be eligible, they number one have to go to the personnel office to fill out an application.

727
00:55:44,297 --> 00:55:49,585
And then the main component, the most important component, is their application date.

728
00:55:49,966 --> 00:55:55,554
They're then put on a list of applicants, and we start going down the list according to their application date.

729
00:55:56,346 --> 00:56:07,495
And then we send a letter to them to see if they're interested, get a waiver form that they have to sign so that we can do a criminal background check on them, do employer checks and neighborhood checks if need be.

730
00:56:08,055 --> 00:56:13,540
And then if we need to send them for medical or physical, so we get the okay for all of that.

731
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:19,965
It's a little bit of a process, but we've learned from past experiences certain things can't be overlooked even for

732
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:23,884
the post that may be one hour in the morning and one hour in the afternoon.

733
00:56:23,904 --> 00:56:25,464
We have to make sure we cover all the paces.

734
00:56:25,864 --> 00:56:30,745
I think, um, you know, regardless of the amount of time that they're out there, it's a very important job, a very vital job.

735
00:56:30,825 --> 00:56:34,926
I certainly have no problem with putting them through a, you know, intense vetting process.

736
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:41,728
Um, a suggestion chief, one of the things that I've seen work at in other communities, um, when I, when I was representing city workers,

737
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:57,350
was a per diem list that they used, and they'd call in retirees who had served in the position before, who had already gone through the vetting process, who had already served in the position before, been trained at it, had passed a CORI check, and brought them in on a per diem basis, almost like an O3 contract employee that the state uses.

738
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:07,580
So just a suggestion, Chief, in looking at maybe a short-term solution would be maybe contacting some of the retirees so you don't need to go through the process of training and the process of vetting as intensely as you would somebody that's new.

739
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,080
But people retire for a reason, I know.

740
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:13,143
The unfortunate part with that is a lot of the retirees and the traffic supervisors union

741
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:15,050
have left the state.

742
00:57:15,651 --> 00:57:23,016
A lot of them have retired and moved to Florida or down south where it's a little bit warmer and they're not dealing with the winters, but it's a good idea.

743
00:57:23,076 --> 00:57:25,037
I don't know how many are still in the area.

744
00:57:25,117 --> 00:57:25,798
We'll look into it.

745
00:57:25,978 --> 00:57:26,218
Awesome.

746
00:57:26,278 --> 00:57:26,458
Thank you.

747
00:57:26,478 --> 00:57:27,119
I appreciate it.

748
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:29,500
On the motion of council marks to receive in place on file.

749
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:30,421
All those in favor.

750
00:57:31,062 --> 00:57:31,642
All those opposed.

751
00:57:31,662 --> 00:57:32,583
Thank you chief very much.

752
00:57:32,743 --> 00:57:34,544
Thank you.

753
00:57:34,644 --> 00:57:36,685
Item 14-757 has been withdrawn from the petitioner.

754
00:57:36,846 --> 00:57:38,227
Motion to receive in place on file.

755
00:57:38,827 --> 00:57:39,507
All those in favor.

756
00:57:39,527 --> 00:57:40,228
All those opposed.

757
00:57:41,055 --> 00:57:42,737
Chair recognizes Councilor De La Russo.

758
00:57:42,997 --> 00:57:51,667
Mr. President, motion to invoke rule number 33 to take papers in the hand of the president.

759
00:57:52,208 --> 00:57:52,949
All those in favor?

760
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:54,130
All those opposed?

761
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:54,731
The ayes have it.

762
00:57:55,692 --> 00:57:58,095
Item under suspension.

763
00:57:58,889 --> 00:57:59,869
Offered by President Camus.

764
00:57:59,889 --> 00:58:03,731
So be it resolved the city council appointment to M belt that has expired.

765
00:58:03,791 --> 00:58:04,311
Be discussed.

766
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:08,872
If I may, from the chair, Councilor Penta has doing it, been doing a great job with this.

767
00:58:09,512 --> 00:58:14,114
And from the chair, if I may like to make the motion to reappoint him to that position, if there's a second.

768
00:58:15,674 --> 00:58:16,935
I'll second.

769
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:17,535
Councilor Knight.

770
00:58:17,975 --> 00:58:21,576
Um, Mr. President and a city clerk Finn will be able to attest to this.

771
00:58:21,716 --> 00:58:26,778
Um, over the past several weeks he and I have been going back and forth and uh, it was my intention to file a resolution.

772
00:58:27,367 --> 00:58:33,842
And this resolution would be that the city clerk provide us with a list of all the positions that fall into the purview of the council for appointment.

773
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:39,964
And the purpose that he would provide us with this list is for us to determine what the actual job description of these positions would be.

774
00:58:40,004 --> 00:58:48,730
And also establish a performance evaluation tool to determine whether or not the employees that are actually in these positions are meeting the objectives and the goals that we set forth, Mr. President.

775
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:59,818
So while I do appreciate your resolution this morning and your recommendation, I think that it might be a good idea for us to take a look at the actual role and function of our representative on the MBELT board.

776
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:04,303
Maybe take a look at what exactly it is that we'd expect of them to report back to us.

777
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:07,548
And maybe if there's a meeting schedule, stuff like that.

778
00:59:07,588 --> 00:59:12,073
Certain requirements and protocols that we'd like to see take place so that we're sure that we're being informed.

779
00:59:12,954 --> 00:59:13,956
Furthermore, I also

780
00:59:15,282 --> 00:59:20,165
I'm not aware whether or not it's a requirement that a member of this council has to be the appointee.

781
00:59:20,346 --> 00:59:23,027
And that might be something else that we would like to discuss, Mr. President.

782
00:59:23,067 --> 00:59:30,232
Maybe someone that this council as a body can agree on to serve on the in-built board, because we're torn in a lot of different directions at this point in time.

783
00:59:30,252 --> 00:59:41,340
Appointing one of us to that board may not necessarily meet the goals and objectives that we set forth for the position, just based upon time and attention and the ability to really focus on it, Mr. President.

784
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:49,403
So with that being said, at this point in time, I'm going to be filing a contrary resolution, Mr. President, in the coming weeks to bring this stuff up.

785
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:50,624
So I'd ask that the matter be tabled.

786
00:59:51,724 --> 00:59:54,105
There's a motion to table, which is undebatable.

787
00:59:55,706 --> 00:59:56,706
All those in favor of the table?

788
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,867
Aye.

789
00:59:58,507 --> 00:59:59,747
Roll call has been requested.

790
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:03,469
And this is nothing against the job of Councilor Penn for the job that he's done in the role.

791
01:00:04,015 --> 01:00:11,280
I just think that, you know, it's very important for us to take a look at what exactly it is expected of these people that are coming under our purview time and time and time again.

792
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,363
We reappoint people to positions, but there's really no measuring stick.

793
01:00:14,383 --> 01:00:19,526
There's no best practice that's in place here for us to determine whether or not we're getting what we need to get in terms of information.

794
01:00:20,827 --> 01:00:21,107
Thank you.

795
01:00:21,127 --> 01:00:23,049
Counselor motion to table.

796
01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:28,773
Although there's a motion to table, there's a motion to table.

797
01:00:29,633 --> 01:00:33,315
We're going to take a vote on the motion, a table, and then if it doesn't get table, we're going to have plenty of emotion.

798
01:00:33,855 --> 01:00:34,536
We draw the motion.

799
01:00:34,556 --> 01:00:36,257
Counselor Penter and then counselor max.

800
01:00:36,637 --> 01:00:44,862
First of all, um, for the purposes of identifying my colleague, my newest colleague on there, this council does have a representative.

801
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:49,544
It's part of the legislation that was passed back in the late nineties, late nineties.

802
01:00:49,584 --> 01:00:50,285
That's number one.

803
01:00:50,365 --> 01:00:54,087
We have a definite role by being on that board.

804
01:00:54,287 --> 01:00:57,509
The board meets approximately once a month, if not,

805
01:00:58,203 --> 01:00:59,483
maybe once every six weeks.

806
01:01:00,143 --> 01:01:12,946
And the purpose of the board is to enhance the viability of the Sheppard Brooks estates, um, which serves an educational and a, um, historical purpose here for the city of Medford.

807
01:01:13,906 --> 01:01:23,088
Second of all, um, you were given a book, I believe when you first got elected that showed you the whole intent and of what the,

808
01:01:23,529 --> 01:01:25,370
background was of the Brooks estates.

809
01:01:26,011 --> 01:01:33,456
Um, it had an in depth detail of where it came from, um, how it got itself started and the endeavor that it's going on.

810
01:01:33,596 --> 01:01:44,643
And we all know that it's, um, it's, it's, it's a long, hard endeavor, which includes a road in a building upgrade of approximately three and a half million dollars to get itself back on the road.

811
01:01:45,263 --> 01:01:52,468
Um, the purpose of the legislative person, be it myself, who has sat on that board is to enhance, um,

812
01:01:52,908 --> 01:02:11,580
not only the viability of the Shepard Brooks Estates, by supporting and not supporting, depending on what takes place at our monthly meetings, for which are publicly noticed out in the clerk's office, for which minutes of the meetings are readily available if anyone so chose to go look at them and to see what is being discussed.

813
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:20,365
I feel quite confident that my role and my position on the board has not only satisfied the responsibility of a counselor sitting on that board, but at the same time,

814
01:02:20,857 --> 01:02:29,422
It's part of the legislative obligation, which is part of the law that was passed and duly recorded at the Middlesex Registry Deeds for this particular position.

815
01:02:30,463 --> 01:02:36,987
But if Counselor Knight has an issue with that, I- Point of information, Counselor Knight.

816
01:02:37,387 --> 01:02:40,549
It's no reflection on the job that you're doing, Counselor Penter.

817
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:41,609
As a matter of fact,

818
01:02:45,178 --> 01:02:46,920
I don't think that you're doing a bad job at all.

819
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:52,324
My question was, let's determine what exactly it is we're looking for out of the individual that's in this place.

820
01:02:52,364 --> 01:02:56,628
Now, we have some legislative enabling language that's in there that's going to speak to that, and that's okay.

821
01:02:56,888 --> 01:03:02,293
But we also have other positions that fall under the purview of this council, and it's not just necessarily the end belt appointment.

822
01:03:02,573 --> 01:03:05,376
And if we're going to do it, we should do it at one time, and we should do it for all.

823
01:03:05,436 --> 01:03:06,237
I don't think we should do.

824
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:21,429
the clerk, the messenger, the home-health stadium appointee, the in-belt appointee at separate times, I think it would make more sense for us to sit down and to establish a best practice for this council and a best practice for the way that we're gonna continue to do business in terms of these appointments that fall under Rapperview.

825
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:26,193
Really, that's the intent of the resolution that I am intending to file.

826
01:03:26,253 --> 01:03:32,438
It hasn't been filed yet, so at this point in time, the only matter that's before us is Councilor Camuso's resolution that he filed.

827
01:03:32,478 --> 01:03:35,401
He has a recommendation on the floor and I've removed

828
01:03:36,460 --> 01:03:39,745
my objection or my motion to table.

829
01:03:39,825 --> 01:03:41,928
I certainly think that the matter should be tabled.

830
01:03:41,948 --> 01:03:47,115
I'm going to vote against the resolution this evening because I feel as though it should be tabled and for the reasons that I set forth.

831
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:50,841
However, please don't take this as an attack.

832
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:53,164
Counselor, I don't think you're doing a bad job, but I think you're doing a great job.

833
01:03:53,734 --> 01:03:58,635
Certainly, I think that it falls under the purview and the responsibility of this council for someone to be serving on that body.

834
01:03:58,675 --> 01:04:02,717
I just think that I'd like to have a little bit more information going forward.

835
01:04:02,777 --> 01:04:07,578
I certainly have taken a look at the master plan that the Shepard Brooks M-Belt group has put together.

836
01:04:08,558 --> 01:04:09,699
It's a great plan, you know what I mean?

837
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:12,379
It looks like it's something that they put a lot of time and effort into.

838
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:14,820
It's something that I couldn't support in terms of bonding.

839
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,560
But that's a whole different story.

840
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:26,042
My question really is the representation, the best practices that are in place, the job description, and how we actually evaluate performance and measure performance of the people that we're actually recommending to go into these jobs.

841
01:04:26,302 --> 01:04:26,662
That's all.

842
01:04:26,682 --> 01:04:27,962
No more than that.

843
01:04:27,982 --> 01:04:29,322
Thank you, Counselor.

844
01:04:29,342 --> 01:04:30,563
Counselor Meis.

845
01:04:30,583 --> 01:04:31,503
Thank you, Mr. President.

846
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:44,645
And Counselor Knight brings up a lot of good points about best practices, about the vetting process, about evaluating particular people, and I would be in

847
01:04:45,057 --> 01:04:58,584
whole heart, uh, support, uh, if we included, and I haven't seen your proposal yet, but, uh, it would not limit it to, uh, the president of the council, the vice president of the council.

848
01:04:59,324 --> 01:05:03,266
I mean, uh, you've already voted yourself on the president and the vice president of the council.

849
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:14,732
Um, I'm not sure what vetting process you took into consideration during that process, but, uh, there are a number of positions, the, uh, all, all the different, uh, committees that,

850
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:18,667
uh, people are appointed to, uh, all our council committees.

851
01:05:19,168 --> 01:05:22,689
So I think if we're going to look at a process, I would agree with you.

852
01:05:23,149 --> 01:05:33,173
And I think we should start from, uh, the appointment of the president, which is probably our most, uh, important, uh, appointment as a council and work our way down.

853
01:05:33,273 --> 01:05:42,457
So if your proposal includes that, uh, which I hope it does, because tonight there was a meeting to discuss organizational for next year.

854
01:05:43,127 --> 01:05:45,188
And I didn't hear anything about a vetting process.

855
01:05:45,569 --> 01:05:50,271
I didn't hear about anything about someone's ability to lead this council.

856
01:05:50,892 --> 01:05:54,374
Uh, so I, I, if it includes all that, that's, that's go for it.

857
01:05:54,494 --> 01:06:01,979
But I don't think we should just pick and choose, uh, what positions we'd like to take a look at and provide these best practices to.

858
01:06:02,399 --> 01:06:03,640
It should be everyone across the board.

859
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:03,940
I mean the,

860
01:06:04,582 --> 01:06:15,970
The positions that I was looking at, and the reason why I haven't brought the resolution forward is because we're still working on determining what other positions, based on past practice and past legislative action, actually falls under our scope, you know?

861
01:06:16,651 --> 01:06:18,632
And that's really why I haven't brought the measure forward.

862
01:06:18,652 --> 01:06:20,153
I mean, you can ask the clerk.

863
01:06:20,193 --> 01:06:24,376
I think, Edwin, that I bring this up maybe June, July, even before that.

864
01:06:24,456 --> 01:06:26,838
So this is something that we've been working on and going back and forth on.

865
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:27,999
But again, you know,

866
01:06:28,807 --> 01:06:32,610
it's a resolution when I bring it, if I, when I, when in fact I do bring the matter forward, it can be amended.

867
01:06:33,091 --> 01:06:36,814
Um, you know, I was looking at the positions of the whole mail commission.

868
01:06:36,934 --> 01:06:38,455
I was looking at the position of the M belt.

869
01:06:38,515 --> 01:06:40,537
I was looking at the position of the city messenger, the city clerk.

870
01:06:40,797 --> 01:06:47,963
Those were the four that were glaring to me in terms of appointments that are under the purview of the council people that are actually appointed to serve.

871
01:06:48,423 --> 01:06:50,966
Um, so, you know, counselor, I'm all for that debate.

872
01:06:51,186 --> 01:06:52,887
Um, you know, I will bring this matter forward.

873
01:06:53,288 --> 01:06:54,969
Um, I'll bring it forward sooner rather than later.

874
01:06:55,668 --> 01:06:58,771
However, I don't want that to hold up the resolution that's before us right now.

875
01:06:59,472 --> 01:07:04,116
So, you know, with that being said, I think I've talked ad nauseum on this as to where I'm coming from.

876
01:07:04,176 --> 01:07:07,940
I certainly appreciate and can, you know, understand where you're coming from.

877
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,444
I mean, if there are going to be criteria in place, there should be criteria in place, and I have no problem with that.

878
01:07:13,745 --> 01:07:18,349
If I may, just from the chair, very briefly, I did not know that that's what you were thinking.

879
01:07:18,369 --> 01:07:21,031
I think it's a very, very good piece, but at this point,

880
01:07:22,642 --> 01:07:32,567
I, as one member of the council, have vetted Councilor Pinto on this particular matter, and the motion is before us for approval, but I do totally support your motion when it comes forward, sooner than later.

881
01:07:33,087 --> 01:07:35,068
I guess my question is, has the term expired?

882
01:07:35,408 --> 01:07:37,829
The term has been expired for several years now.

883
01:07:41,151 --> 01:07:50,175
And he's been a carryover, so especially with a lot of the stuff going on up there, that was my intent, to have an actual appointment of the council rather than a carryover with everything going on.

884
01:07:53,041 --> 01:07:54,942
Point of information, Councilor DelaRusso.

885
01:07:55,103 --> 01:08:00,266
If I cut through the chair to the clerk, could the clerk tell us how long this appointment is for?

886
01:08:03,789 --> 01:08:09,954
I can only go back, you know, to when I started, you know, and I believe it's the six year appointments.

887
01:08:10,974 --> 01:08:17,459
And the first time that I was involved with it before the count was 1998.

888
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:22,383
And that appointment was proposed by, uh,

889
01:08:24,318 --> 01:08:27,020
I think the president at the end belt at the time, Jay Griffin.

890
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:40,690
And then again, uh, in 2004 was the last time we had a council that voted on, uh, which was the reappointment again by, uh, uh, Jay Griffin.

891
01:08:40,710 --> 01:08:45,894
So if that was a six year appointment, I'm only thinking at six, then you have, you know, in 2010.

892
01:08:47,195 --> 01:08:49,977
It was a council president who made the appointment, which was Bob Mayorka.

893
01:08:51,337 --> 01:08:53,738
Jay Griffin proposed.

894
01:08:53,878 --> 01:08:54,079
Yeah.

895
01:08:54,279 --> 01:08:54,439
Yeah.

896
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,042
So there is a motion for approval.

897
01:09:00,282 --> 01:09:01,783
The motion to table was withdrawn.

898
01:09:01,803 --> 01:09:11,187
So there's a motion for approval and I would request someone to call a roll call vote where this is an appointment.

899
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:19,732
I believe before the role is called that this discussion has come up before with the city clerk, uh, straight to the city solicitor.

900
01:09:20,248 --> 01:09:31,032
regarding my position and it's duly recorded in your office, Mr. Clerk and the city solicitor's vendors opinion that it's acceptable for me to serve in this position.

901
01:09:31,572 --> 01:09:32,352
And you still want it.

902
01:09:32,392 --> 01:09:33,453
I assume I'm putting it forward.

903
01:09:33,473 --> 01:09:34,053
I'm talking to you.

904
01:09:34,113 --> 01:09:34,713
You want it, right?

905
01:09:34,773 --> 01:09:35,033
Okay.

906
01:09:35,574 --> 01:09:37,334
After all this discussion, you might not have wanted it.

907
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,435
Yeah.

908
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:44,017
So there is a motion before us for this reappointment.

909
01:09:44,117 --> 01:09:46,578
I just have one clarification for you.

910
01:09:47,138 --> 01:09:47,598
Is this to,

911
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:53,160
say it was expired 2010, is this to go to 2016?

912
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:55,062
It goes back to the date of expiration?

913
01:09:55,082 --> 01:09:57,443
Or is this to go another 60 years starting today?

914
01:09:57,503 --> 01:10:00,245
No, it's from the date of, it was retroactive.

915
01:10:00,265 --> 01:10:02,747
So this is 2016 expiration.

916
01:10:04,508 --> 01:10:07,610
Please note that, I'd like to propose it that way.

917
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:16,977
The clerk will call the roll and please, yes vote is for Councilor Penta and a no vote

918
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:22,196
is not against Councilor Penter and no vote is just like to do the vetting process with all of them.

919
01:10:22,256 --> 01:10:30,259
I assume, I'm not speaking for any council, I'm just, I think it's only fair that I say that to my colleague here, because we heard Councilor Knight loud and clear with direction you're going.

920
01:10:31,919 --> 01:10:33,520
Okay.

921
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:34,880
Vice President Caravaglia.

922
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:35,240
Yes.

923
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:37,021
Councilor Dela Russo.

924
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:37,301
Yes.

925
01:10:37,881 --> 01:10:38,341
Councilor Knight.

926
01:10:43,398 --> 01:10:46,558
I'd like to be recorded in the negative.

927
01:10:46,638 --> 01:10:55,260
Mr. Clerk, for the reasons that I stated forthwith, I'd like to see a performance evaluation measure and a job description for positions underneath the city council purview.

928
01:10:56,721 --> 01:10:57,321
Duly noted.

929
01:10:57,421 --> 01:11:00,281
Can the clerk please put that in the minutes to reflect that?

930
01:11:02,082 --> 01:11:02,262
Yes.

931
01:11:08,318 --> 01:11:15,348
Yes, by a vote of six in the affirmative, one in the negative because of the reasons that were stated by Councilor Knight.

932
01:11:15,448 --> 01:11:21,997
Councilor Pinto, you are reaffirmed retroactively to the six year position as of the date of expiration.

933
01:11:22,017 --> 01:11:22,637
Congratulations.

934
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:24,420
Would you like to say a few words or are you all set?

935
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:25,161
I'm all set.

936
01:11:25,481 --> 01:11:25,762
All right.

937
01:11:27,427 --> 01:11:28,468
while we're under suspension.

938
01:11:28,908 --> 01:11:30,730
Offered by Vice President Caraviello.

939
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,332
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Father Toomey of St.

940
01:11:34,372 --> 01:11:38,876
Rayfield's Parish, who just celebrated 36 years in the priesthood last Tuesday.

941
01:11:38,956 --> 01:11:39,496
Vice President.

942
01:11:40,037 --> 01:11:40,777
Thank you, Mr. President.

943
01:11:40,817 --> 01:11:43,419
I just want to congratulate Father Toomey.

944
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:45,080
He's a good man, good community guy.

945
01:11:46,461 --> 01:11:49,844
On his 36 years, not at all at St.

946
01:11:49,884 --> 01:11:52,646
Rayfield's, but just in the priesthood.

947
01:11:54,887 --> 01:11:55,388
Very, very

948
01:11:56,713 --> 01:11:58,734
big part of our community, to say the least.

949
01:11:59,474 --> 01:12:00,255
All those in favor.

950
01:12:00,695 --> 01:12:01,135
Aye.

951
01:12:01,596 --> 01:12:02,196
All those opposed.

952
01:12:02,236 --> 01:12:02,816
The ayes have it.

953
01:12:02,856 --> 01:12:03,537
Congratulations.

954
01:12:03,577 --> 01:12:04,117
Father to me.

955
01:12:05,578 --> 01:12:08,619
Item 14 dash seven 58 offered by council of Penta.

956
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:12,561
We get resolved with the recent street sweeping in some parts of the West Medford area.

957
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:13,182
Be discussed.

958
01:12:13,682 --> 01:12:14,402
Councilor Penta.

959
01:12:14,522 --> 01:12:15,223
Is the chief still here?

960
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:16,823
Chief is gone.

961
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:18,944
I was hoping he was going to stay.

962
01:12:19,365 --> 01:12:25,688
Um, over this past weekend, I received a telephone calls and six emails from folks from Mammoth street,

963
01:12:26,069 --> 01:12:34,391
Blakely Road, and other locations, where they received robocalls as it related their streets were going to be swept on the 17th and the 18th, respectively.

964
01:12:34,951 --> 01:12:38,292
And streets were never swept, tagged, ticketed, and towed.

965
01:12:39,212 --> 01:12:43,053
My comment on that particular issue, Mr. President, is very simple.

966
01:12:44,073 --> 01:12:54,395
If you were tagged, ticketed, or towed, and any one of the robocalls that went out or any way your houses were identified that your streets were going to be swept, I think you should come to City Hall, go to the mayor's office, and demand your money back.

967
01:12:55,198 --> 01:12:56,338
This is absolutely wrong.

968
01:12:56,678 --> 01:12:57,238
It's unfair.

969
01:12:57,899 --> 01:13:01,599
You don't turn around and tell the people and the streets as of this day has still not been swept.

970
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:04,340
You don't have people get all excited to move their cars.

971
01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:12,621
And if they're going to get a ticket or toad, if they don't do it, and then when they do get ticket and toad and the street never gets itself swept, that even adds to the, to the anxiety.

972
01:13:13,021 --> 01:13:15,862
And as we speak right now, it continues to add to the anxiety.

973
01:13:16,242 --> 01:13:17,142
So I just think it's wrong.

974
01:13:17,182 --> 01:13:18,322
I think the procedure is wrong.

975
01:13:18,723 --> 01:13:21,103
If there's a reason why the streets weren't swept, so be it.

976
01:13:21,678 --> 01:13:22,979
Those people should be notified.

977
01:13:23,299 --> 01:13:28,462
If you got a ticket, you got tagged and you got towed, bring it to city hall and it should be, and it should be reflected.

978
01:13:28,763 --> 01:13:40,570
If I remember correctly, at some point in time last year, a situation like this happened and I believe the mayor made an announcement that he would take and bring whoever got him during the specific period for whatever the issue was, bring them to city hall and they would be abated.

979
01:13:40,970 --> 01:13:42,071
So that would be my suggestion.

980
01:13:42,091 --> 01:13:48,195
I was hoping the chief was going to stay for this because it was on the agenda and I know he was CC'd on some of these requests that, um,

981
01:13:49,089 --> 01:13:51,430
I don't have an answer because nobody can tell us why the streets weren't swept.

982
01:13:51,851 --> 01:13:53,051
I don't know, but they weren't.

983
01:13:53,331 --> 01:13:56,113
But all I know is this, that people did get tagged, ticketed, and towed.

984
01:13:56,433 --> 01:13:59,775
And as a result of that, they should be entitled to get their money back.

985
01:14:01,736 --> 01:14:02,236
And that's it.

986
01:14:02,276 --> 01:14:03,697
I just, I don't understand it.

987
01:14:04,257 --> 01:14:05,738
Councilor Knight and Councilor Mox.

988
01:14:06,378 --> 01:14:07,599
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

989
01:14:07,839 --> 01:14:09,080
In similar

990
01:14:09,852 --> 01:14:22,398
substance, I recently got a call from some residents who are residing on Placetet Road and they expressed concern over the big sweep and the amount of leaves that have built up in and outside Oak Grove Cemetery, Mr. President.

991
01:14:22,418 --> 01:14:32,704
So I'd like to amend the resolution also to ask that the leaves on both sides of the fence at Oak Grove Cemetery abutting Placetet Road be removed prior to the conclusion of the big sweep.

992
01:14:34,945 --> 01:14:36,986
On the motion as amended, Councilor Mox.

993
01:14:38,546 --> 01:14:39,507
Thank you, Mr. President.

994
01:14:40,478 --> 01:14:53,782
As Councilor Penta mentioned, um, you know, I find it very interesting that we have permanent signs posted for resident permit parking throughout the city.

995
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:58,563
For years, the city did never, no enforcement at all.

996
01:14:59,823 --> 01:15:06,465
We have a street sweeping program with no permanent signage and they tow and tag cars.

997
01:15:08,143 --> 01:15:10,285
I can't figure this city out, Mr. President.

998
01:15:11,166 --> 01:15:13,888
It doesn't operate correctly.

999
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:18,752
You have permanent signage, you don't enforce permit parking.

1000
01:15:19,232 --> 01:15:21,855
You don't have signage for street sweeping, you tag and tow.

1001
01:15:22,595 --> 01:15:27,860
And this is not the first time we've heard this problem, as many councils will be.

1002
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:35,606
Last year we faced the same thing, when they tagged and towed a number of cars, and the city had to reflect upon it,

1003
01:15:36,003 --> 01:15:37,804
and said they tagged and told an error.

1004
01:15:38,764 --> 01:15:40,184
This happens year after year.

1005
01:15:41,064 --> 01:15:50,267
And as a council, I think we've been on board, at least I know myself a dozen times asking the administration to look into permanent street sweeping signage.

1006
01:15:51,387 --> 01:15:58,929
And we have yet to get an answer because we still currently don't have a full fledged street sweeping program in this community.

1007
01:15:59,469 --> 01:16:01,170
It's no reflection upon DPW.

1008
01:16:01,893 --> 01:16:17,744
It's a reflection upon the administration who refuses to put in place a street-sweeping program that makes sense, that actually sweeps our streets, and does it more frequently than twice a year.

1009
01:16:18,184 --> 01:16:19,525
It's inadequate, Mr. President.

1010
01:16:19,945 --> 01:16:28,411
And the fact that we're still using notification methods of an electronic billboard shows you how far behind the times we are in this community.

1011
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:30,292
Thank you, Mr. President.

1012
01:16:31,969 --> 01:16:32,649
All right, thank you.

1013
01:16:33,290 --> 01:16:34,270
On the motion as amended.

1014
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:36,691
Councilor Pentland.

1015
01:16:36,811 --> 01:16:45,235
Just to re-up this because, you know, this is going to present itself with another issue forthcoming this winter as it relates to snow emergencies and how they're going to take place.

1016
01:16:45,596 --> 01:16:50,278
You know, not everybody goes to their computer every day to go on the city's webpage to see what's going on.

1017
01:16:51,338 --> 01:16:59,122
People have other more important things to do like their job, their family, their kids, and making sure they stay alive with their job and making sure payments are being done.

1018
01:16:59,862 --> 01:17:03,184
So to turn around and say you should have gone to the city's website, bingo.

1019
01:17:03,204 --> 01:17:07,287
And if you didn't watch the city's website, well, what was the other alternative?

1020
01:17:07,327 --> 01:17:08,488
Now we're going to do robocalls.

1021
01:17:08,508 --> 01:17:09,689
So the robocalls go out.

1022
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:22,078
And when the robocalls go out, and the people do get them, and they do follow them, and they do subscribe to them, and nothing takes place, and then you penalize the taxpayer, I mean, where does that put us?

1023
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:28,703
We were told when we had this discussion last year after, I believe it was the snow emergency, and I think it was at your behest,

1024
01:17:29,201 --> 01:17:45,154
Councilor Langel-Curran, when we were talking about off of, uh, off of, uh, by Magoon Park, those streets there where the neighbors came down and they wanted to have an opportunity to park on their street until the, until the, uh, I can't think of the name of the street and the residents.

1025
01:17:45,834 --> 01:17:53,961
And we have the chief of police down here and we have the people from the department of public works down here to allow the people to park on the street rather than in the wintertime, you only can park on one side of the street.

1026
01:17:53,981 --> 01:17:54,421
Do you remember?

1027
01:17:55,577 --> 01:18:03,538
And we had that discussion and we were, we were informed that we were going to discuss that in the same way we were going to discuss the issue that we have here in front of us right now.

1028
01:18:04,038 --> 01:18:05,919
And it's right back in our face all over again.

1029
01:18:06,459 --> 01:18:07,779
So I don't know what it takes.

1030
01:18:07,839 --> 01:18:08,659
I don't know how it's run.

1031
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:14,080
The police don't go down the street anymore with the bullhorn telling the people, you know, to get your cars off the street.

1032
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:22,342
It's being told the department of public works won't do it because all they do is get to go down the street with a lead man and the sweet stripper goes down there.

1033
01:18:22,442 --> 01:18:24,262
So who's going to hear that particular person?

1034
01:18:24,618 --> 01:18:26,179
and when in fact that takes place.

1035
01:18:26,739 --> 01:18:39,765
So we do definitely have a problem here as it relates to not only snow removal, which is going to be forthcoming, but also with these issues of getting these robocalls and the city not doing that for which they're telling residents to do and the residents get ticket tagged and towed.

1036
01:18:40,125 --> 01:18:51,670
So once again, anyone who was ticket tagged and towed, if you got a robocall and they never came and swept your street and it still isn't swept, I would suggest that you go to city hall, go to the mayor's office and demand that you want your money back

1037
01:18:52,288 --> 01:18:57,751
and that you do not want that attached to your driver's license or your registration to your car.

1038
01:18:57,991 --> 01:18:58,872
Because it's just unfair.

1039
01:19:00,653 --> 01:19:03,815
One of the memos that I got, a lady came home and her car was gone.

1040
01:19:04,615 --> 01:19:05,496
Her car was gone.

1041
01:19:05,536 --> 01:19:08,237
And there was no reason why the car should be gone, because the street wasn't there.

1042
01:19:08,458 --> 01:19:09,438
She had to pick up her son.

1043
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:11,119
She had no money, and she had no car.

1044
01:19:11,539 --> 01:19:15,762
And she had to do something on the alternative to do that, because she did what she was supposed to do.

1045
01:19:16,582 --> 01:19:21,165
So with that being said, Mr. President, that's my resolution.

1046
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:28,783
Anyone that got it, please go to the, uh, and I would suggest still keep sending your emails to the chief of police, the mayor's office.

1047
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:35,846
If this is continuing to go on, to go on in other parts of the city, then that's what you need to do because there's no form there.

1048
01:19:36,207 --> 01:19:40,389
You talk about having a system to vet out councils and positions.

1049
01:19:40,869 --> 01:19:48,373
Well, maybe we should have a system to vet out our administrators as to what they're supposed to do when they say they're going to do something.

1050
01:19:48,713 --> 01:19:49,814
Oh, the election counselor.

1051
01:19:49,974 --> 01:19:50,655
Yeah, I know that.

1052
01:19:51,035 --> 01:19:52,637
I know that election every two years.

1053
01:19:53,398 --> 01:19:57,682
So with that being said, uh, Mr. President, I move the issue on the motion of council.

1054
01:19:57,702 --> 01:19:58,523
Penter as amended.

1055
01:19:58,703 --> 01:19:59,263
Roll call vote.

1056
01:19:59,584 --> 01:20:00,725
Roll call has been requested.

1057
01:20:02,346 --> 01:20:03,267
Clerk will call the roll.

1058
01:20:03,487 --> 01:20:04,608
Vice-president Caviello.

1059
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:06,390
Councilor DelaRusso.

1060
01:20:06,731 --> 01:20:06,951
Yes.

1061
01:20:07,651 --> 01:20:08,272
Councilor Nye.

1062
01:20:08,372 --> 01:20:08,552
Yes.

1063
01:20:09,533 --> 01:20:10,374
Councilor McCurran.

1064
01:20:10,394 --> 01:20:10,554
Yes.

1065
01:20:10,975 --> 01:20:11,555
Councilor Maxwell.

1066
01:20:11,956 --> 01:20:12,196
Yes.

1067
01:20:12,582 --> 01:20:13,162
Council Penta?

1068
01:20:13,182 --> 01:20:13,463
Yes.

1069
01:20:13,723 --> 01:20:14,383
President Camuso?

1070
01:20:14,423 --> 01:20:14,624
Yes.

1071
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:16,865
By a vote of seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1072
01:20:17,306 --> 01:20:21,649
A motion passes and revert back to the regular order of business.

1073
01:20:22,610 --> 01:20:23,250
The records.

1074
01:20:23,631 --> 01:20:24,271
Mr. President.

1075
01:20:24,632 --> 01:20:24,872
Okay.

1076
01:20:26,053 --> 01:20:26,793
Councilor Marks.

1077
01:20:26,953 --> 01:20:30,156
Just if I could, Mr. President, we received two responses.

1078
01:20:31,017 --> 01:20:32,638
If I could just read them from the administration.

1079
01:20:33,879 --> 01:20:38,943
Um, it was, uh, the first one is a paper 14 dash four nine nine.

1080
01:20:39,643 --> 01:20:41,425
And there was a response, uh, out to,

1081
01:20:42,463 --> 01:20:50,907
um, waste management regarding, uh, them picking up trash on major thoroughfares during peak traffic hours in the community.

1082
01:20:51,467 --> 01:20:54,389
And we did get a response from James Nocella.

1083
01:20:55,129 --> 01:20:57,530
Uh, he is the area manager of waste management.

1084
01:20:57,930 --> 01:21:09,376
And if I could just read it, cause this is an important issue, Mr. President says, we have reviewed the council's request for the mayor to alert waste management on picking up trash on main thoroughfares at peak travel times.

1085
01:21:09,996 --> 01:21:11,997
The issue was previously brought to our attention,

1086
01:21:12,403 --> 01:21:16,446
by the administration as a core to our mission to zero safety program.

1087
01:21:16,866 --> 01:21:22,870
We continuously review our routing practices and make every effort to avoid high risk situations.

1088
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:27,453
We will continue to avoid peak travel collection wherever and whenever practical.

1089
01:21:28,214 --> 01:21:29,234
Thank you for your concern.

1090
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:33,517
And also, Mr. President, paper 14-743.

1091
01:21:34,058 --> 01:21:40,382
It was a council resolution asking for the lighting on Boston Ave.

1092
01:21:41,056 --> 01:21:48,241
from True Value Hardware down, be looked at by the Superintendent Wise.

1093
01:21:48,761 --> 01:21:57,847
And Mr. Hurley came back saying he did go down and inspect and found out there were several lights that were out and he contacted National Grid.

1094
01:21:58,327 --> 01:22:05,151
So on behalf of the council, I'd like to thank Superintendent Wise, Joe Hurley for his quick action, Mr. President.

1095
01:22:05,452 --> 01:22:05,792
Thank you.

1096
01:22:06,432 --> 01:22:07,413
Thank you for those two updates.

1097
01:22:08,469 --> 01:22:11,950
On the motion, Councilor Penta.

1098
01:22:12,330 --> 01:22:18,532
We also got tonight in our packet, I got both of those things you just talked about, I didn't get.

1099
01:22:18,552 --> 01:22:19,513
I got them both.

1100
01:22:19,533 --> 01:22:20,633
I didn't get them.

1101
01:22:21,814 --> 01:22:23,854
Did you get them?

1102
01:22:23,894 --> 01:22:30,076
We also received a notice of a public hearing scheduled for December 10th regarding the Peace Garden.

1103
01:22:30,136 --> 01:22:38,099
And this is really confusing right now, because now what it's saying, the State Department of Transportation is stating the following,

1104
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:41,181
that a secure right of way is necessary for this project.

1105
01:22:41,802 --> 01:22:46,624
Acquisitions in fee and permanent or temporary easements may be required.

1106
01:22:47,065 --> 01:22:51,447
The city is responsible for acquiring all needed rights in private or public lands.

1107
01:22:52,007 --> 01:22:56,370
MassDOT's policy concerning land acquisitions will be discussed at this hearing.

1108
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:59,031
This is something that's absolutely brand new.

1109
01:22:59,051 --> 01:23:08,376
I believe, Mr. President, the city of Medford, in this particular issue, is the owner of the property.

1110
01:23:09,103 --> 01:23:13,885
And being the owner of the property, it's a city owned piece of property.

1111
01:23:15,046 --> 01:23:20,469
And I don't understand this right of way and this easement, permanent or temporary.

1112
01:23:20,489 --> 01:23:22,450
We've never been advised of anything like this.

1113
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:35,116
And I think we need to have a report back as to why MassDOT is coming in as it relates to our public lands, whether it's the housing authority of the city of Medford, it's still the public lands of the city of Medford and they're not private.

1114
01:23:35,816 --> 01:23:37,617
And with that being said, MassDOT,

1115
01:23:38,703 --> 01:23:43,727
I just don't understand how they can, why are we getting this at this stage of the game?

1116
01:23:43,747 --> 01:23:44,268
I don't know.

1117
01:23:44,748 --> 01:23:54,096
We're talking about, uh, and we're still waiting for a budget director Burke to give us the financial background of how much has been raised so far for this peace garden.

1118
01:23:54,176 --> 01:24:03,403
And now we have to deal with a public hearing regarding a right of way or an easement permanent or temporary that comes under the subject policy of mass dot.

1119
01:24:03,923 --> 01:24:05,144
And they haven't a public hearing on this.

1120
01:24:05,164 --> 01:24:05,745
So, I mean,

1121
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:09,737
Can we get a response back from the office of community development on this?

1122
01:24:09,757 --> 01:24:14,602
Mr. President on the motion of council, a penta to get a report back from office community development.

1123
01:24:14,742 --> 01:24:20,747
And as to why, why we're having, I mean, what are we, what are we acquiring that we don't already own?

1124
01:24:20,767 --> 01:24:21,588
That's what I want to know.

1125
01:24:21,908 --> 01:24:22,588
Counselor night.

1126
01:24:23,569 --> 01:24:24,630
I think that's the purpose of them.

1127
01:24:24,710 --> 01:24:30,115
Maybe we should just go to the meeting and figure out, ask the question right there to the people that are the ones presenting.

1128
01:24:31,763 --> 01:24:32,863
The meeting is December 10th.

1129
01:24:32,964 --> 01:24:37,006
We've been told all along, none of this has ever come up under any of the discussion.

1130
01:24:37,527 --> 01:24:44,631
Whether it's money that's been taken out of the linkage account, whether it's money that's been taken out of the community walk-around funds, whether it's money taken out of the city's coffers.

1131
01:24:44,852 --> 01:24:46,693
There's been no, this has never come up before.

1132
01:24:47,053 --> 01:24:49,755
Now all of a sudden, the Mass Department of Transportation,

1133
01:24:50,297 --> 01:24:55,461
is sticking its two cents in, either the city didn't do something, or there's something that we're not aware of.

1134
01:24:55,501 --> 01:24:57,162
And I think we should become aware of it.

1135
01:24:57,382 --> 01:25:00,184
I don't want to go to a meeting on December 10th and go and ask questions.

1136
01:25:00,224 --> 01:25:01,124
I want to know ahead of time.

1137
01:25:01,465 --> 01:25:05,047
I've taken votes in this council for the purpose of putting money toward that Peace Garden.

1138
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:08,209
We've taken votes off this council from the linkage accounts.

1139
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:09,410
I'm not waiting until December 10th.

1140
01:25:10,111 --> 01:25:11,231
This is too important an issue.

1141
01:25:11,271 --> 01:25:13,213
It's well in excess of a million dollars.

1142
01:25:13,933 --> 01:25:18,336
And being in excess of that kind of money, and it's being on our city property, why does the Mass.

1143
01:25:18,356 --> 01:25:19,357
Department of Transportation

1144
01:25:19,828 --> 01:25:20,908
have to have this public hearing.

1145
01:25:22,589 --> 01:25:24,290
And I think it's a valid question.

1146
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:26,751
I think the valid question is whether or not it's on city property, right?

1147
01:25:26,911 --> 01:25:27,811
Because if it was.

1148
01:25:27,851 --> 01:25:30,072
Well, if it wasn't city property, you wouldn't be getting this notice.

1149
01:25:30,532 --> 01:25:34,253
So there must be something that either we weren't apprised of or the city wasn't aware of.

1150
01:25:34,493 --> 01:25:35,714
And I think we should become aware of it.

1151
01:25:35,814 --> 01:25:42,376
Or the city might be petitioning MassDOT for an easement on their property, because this is a public hearing for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1152
01:25:43,757 --> 01:25:47,318
It says in the second paragraph, Mr. President, it's in a question form.

1153
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:50,546
The city is responsible for acquiring all needed rights and private lands.

1154
01:25:50,946 --> 01:25:54,627
Mass DOT's policy concerning land acquisitions will be discussed at this.

1155
01:25:55,147 --> 01:25:56,267
What's the land acquisition?

1156
01:25:56,307 --> 01:25:58,488
We were told from day one that's our property.

1157
01:25:58,528 --> 01:25:58,888
We own it.

1158
01:25:59,388 --> 01:26:01,729
Now, if we're buying property, that's another issue.

1159
01:26:01,769 --> 01:26:02,669
I'd like to know what we're buying.

1160
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:06,090
Councilor Knight, are you all set?

1161
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:06,550
I am.

1162
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:07,530
Councilor Mox.

1163
01:26:08,511 --> 01:26:13,992
You know, I don't want to speak out of turn, but I think one of the issues originally was the fact that

1164
01:26:14,665 --> 01:26:24,890
there was going to be a walkway and some discussion needed to be had between housing and the city of method regarding the walkway.

1165
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:27,951
Cause it wasn't our area to, to connect.

1166
01:26:28,672 --> 01:26:33,094
Um, and I, and I, that was one of the issues, but I'm not sure if that's what this is regarding.

1167
01:26:33,974 --> 01:26:40,617
And I agree with council Penta that, you know, you know, we've taken several votes on this already to move money and so forth.

1168
01:26:40,697 --> 01:26:43,859
And, um, it's only appropriate that we get an answer on this immediately.

1169
01:26:44,857 --> 01:26:57,740
Also, for anyone out there, and including Councilor Penta, the email to ask any project inquiries are to dot.feedback.highwayatstate.ma.us.

1170
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:00,100
On the motion of Councilor Penta, all those in favor?

1171
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:00,360
Aye.

1172
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,341
All those opposed?

1173
01:27:01,381 --> 01:27:02,261
The ayes have it.

1174
01:27:03,621 --> 01:27:05,121
Roll call to send this to OCD.

1175
01:27:05,281 --> 01:27:06,302
Roll call has been requested.

1176
01:27:07,002 --> 01:27:07,702
Clerk, call the roll.

1177
01:27:08,682 --> 01:27:09,702
Vice President Caviello?

1178
01:27:09,722 --> 01:27:09,862
Yes.

1179
01:27:10,583 --> 01:27:11,343
Councilor DelaRusso?

1180
01:27:11,363 --> 01:27:11,523
Yes.

1181
01:27:12,183 --> 01:27:12,683
Councilor Knight?

1182
01:27:14,322 --> 01:27:15,064
Councilor Kern.

1183
01:27:15,244 --> 01:27:15,384
Yes.

1184
01:27:15,966 --> 01:27:16,587
Councilor Marks.

1185
01:27:16,988 --> 01:27:17,128
Yes.

1186
01:27:17,569 --> 01:27:18,211
Councilor Penta.

1187
01:27:18,251 --> 01:27:18,371
Yes.

1188
01:27:19,093 --> 01:27:19,734
President Camuso.

1189
01:27:19,935 --> 01:27:20,135
No.

1190
01:27:20,396 --> 01:27:22,160
Five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

1191
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:23,021
The motion passes.

1192
01:27:24,109 --> 01:27:26,871
The records were passed to Councilor Mox.

1193
01:27:26,891 --> 01:27:27,772
How do you find the records?

1194
01:27:30,994 --> 01:27:35,178
Councilor Mox reviewed the records and find them to be in order on the motion for adjournment.

1195
01:27:35,358 --> 01:27:41,422
And before we adjourn, um, I'm going to chair recognizes Councilor Longo Kern.

1196
01:27:41,823 --> 01:27:44,185
Oh, I just want to wish everybody happy Thanksgiving.

1197
01:27:45,726 --> 01:27:46,687
Councilor Dela Russo.

1198
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:47,707
Happy Thanksgiving.

1199
01:27:48,188 --> 01:27:48,508
Thank you.

1200
01:27:48,548 --> 01:27:51,110
I think all the members would like to wish everyone a happy Thanksgiving.

1201
01:27:53,192 --> 01:27:57,994
And last but not least, just an announcement for the community.

1202
01:27:58,555 --> 01:28:05,137
This evening at 6.30, the Medford City Council met in a caucus to discuss the leadership roles for next calendar year, 2015.

1203
01:28:05,578 --> 01:28:10,039
And the Council of De La Russo was nominated.

1204
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:29,534
uh, voted in as the President-Elect of the Medford City Council for next year, and this was not an official vote, which will take place in January, and Councilor Lungo Kern was, uh, nominated and voted as the Vice-President of the Medford City Council for calendar year 2015, so congratulations to my colleagues.

1205
01:28:29,935 --> 01:28:30,295
Thank you.

1206
01:28:30,715 --> 01:28:33,998
Uh, on the motion of Vice-President Caravello for adjournment.

1207
01:28:34,138 --> 01:28:34,859
All those in favor?

1208
01:28:35,659 --> 01:28:36,260
All those opposed?

1209
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:36,780
The ayes have it.

1210
01:28:37,281 --> 01:28:37,961
Happy Thanksgiving.
