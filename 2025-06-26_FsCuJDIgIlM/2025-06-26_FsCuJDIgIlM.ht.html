 Mwen te panse sa te ase pou ekip la aswè a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=143.642s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Gwo, mèsi.
 Kounye a, anvan nou rive nan premye pwen ajanda nou an, mwen vle rekonèt ke Konsèy Devlopman Kominotè nou an ak Komisyon Planifikasyon nou an pa natirèlman politik.
 Men, dapre evènman yo nan 24 èdtan ki sot pase yo, mwen ta dwe neglijans si mwen pa rekonèt enpak ak enpòtans desizyon sa yo sou peyi nou an ak vil nou an.
 Emosyon tankou depresyon, laperèz, enkyetid, ak tristès yo komen nan jou sa yo.
 Antanke Konsèy, nou gen yon responsablite pou travay nan misyon nou pou bay sipò ak defans pou moun ki gen rezidan yo, relasyon yo, otonomi kòporèl yo oswa idantite yo an danje.
 Lè politik nan nivo nasyonal ka santi vrèman akablan, nou ka vire nan pwòp kominote nou yo amelyore lavi nan nivo lokal la.
 Mwen fyè pou m sèvi nan Komite Devlopman Kominotè a e mwen fyè pou m yon manm Konsèy Administrasyon mwen an, e mwen ankouraje tout moun ki gen chans e ki kapab sèvi kominote yo pou yo fè tout sa yo kapab, kit se yon don tan, lajan, oswa konpasyon.
 Mwen trè fyè tou de Medford.
 Patisipasyon votè yo nan vil nou an te apeprè 67%, ak majorite a sipòte kandida ak kòz ki sèvi vwazen nou yo, kominote yo, ak avni Medford yo.
 Kounye a, ann plonje nan ajanda reyinyon nou yo epi ranpli misyon Konsèy la pou gide kwasans ak devlopman tout moun ki abite nan Medford nan yon fason kowòdone ak konplè.
 Mèsi.
 Kidonk, premye bagay ki sou ajanda nou an aswè a se odyans piblik la nan St Paul le 21.
 Chemen Clara.
 Sa a se yon revizyon plan sit lè l sèvi avèk Amannman Dover.
 Mwen pral li avi odyans piblik la.
 Komisyon Devlopman Kominotè Medford la pral òganize yon odyans piblik le 6 novanm 2024.
 Apre 6:30 p.m.
 Yon demann revizyon plan sit Assisi Holdings LLC te soumèt pou renove yon bilding ki egziste deja kat etaj, 12,930 pye kare nan 21 St. te okipe atravè konferans videyo Zoom. Clair Road, Medford, MA 02155 an koneksyon avèk yon pwopozisyon abri pou fanm ak timoun 40 chanm.
 Pwojè a sijè a revizyon plan anplasman pou yon Amannman Dover itilize ak apwobasyon pa Komisyon Konsèy Devlopman Kominotè a dapre Medford Zoning Ordinance Seksyon 94-11-8.
 Mwen ta renmen mande ekip la bay kèk kòmantè entwodiksyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=296.17s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Mersi madam Chairman.
 Ankò, se Danielle Evans, Senior Planner.
 Mwen jis vle ba ou kèk enfòmasyon debaz sou sitiyasyon an devan ou.
 Kòm Prezidan an te mansyone, sa a se yon itilizasyon Amannman Dover ki fèt pou itilizasyon ki pwoteje pa Chapit 48, Seksyon 3, ke yo rekonèt kòm Amannman Dover.
 Se poutèt sa, li bay pwoteksyon pou sèten itilizasyon.
 Nan ka sa a, itilizasyon edikasyon yo ka egzante yo de sèten egzijans òdonans dekoupaj an zòn, tankou kote yo ka lokalize ak fason pou jwenn egzanpsyon nan kondisyon tankou estanda gwosè ak kondisyon pakin.
 Se poutèt sa, sijè ki abòde lan revizyon plan sit la pi limite.
 Se poutèt sa reyinyon an te limite a de konsiltasyon.
 Genyen tou premye kesyon an.
 Repons ki dwe reponn se: Èske itilizasyon an kalifye pou pwoteksyon anba Amannman Dover?
 Dezyèmman, ki dispozisyon rezonab ki genyen konsènan detèminasyon volim ak wotè bilding ak egzijans pwoteksyon bilding ki ta dwe enpoze sou gwosè lakou, zòn lotèl la, kontretan, espas ouvè, pakin ak itilizasyon?
 Aksyon Konsèy la pèmèt aswè a se apwobasyon, apwobasyon kondisyonèl oswa refi, men yo ka refize sèlman si yo pa bay enfòmasyon ki nesesè yo.
 Se konsa, mwen jis vle mete tab la epi kite moun konnen ki sa revizyon an pral ye aswè a ak pouvwa yo nan tablo a.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=382.415s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Sa bon, sa vrèman ede fikse atant lè n ap diskite ak konsèy la epi asiste odyans piblik yo.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=474.263s">[Mike Ross]</a>:  I can see your screen.
 OK.
 All right.
 Well, my name is Mike Ross.
 I'm an attorney with the law firm of Prince Lobel, and I'm representing the applicant tonight.
 Thank you for having me here, Madam Chair, members of the board, and for your comments thus far.
 And also for Daniel Evans for setting the table, really
 really well, just there.
 We are here on a site plan review, as Danielle mentioned, for 21 St.
 Clair Road, and this is a photo of it.
 What we're proposing tonight is a women's and children's shelter.
 And we have members of our team who are prepared to speak about that as well.
 But what I'm going to do is going to provide a high-level overview and then see if there are any questions.
 So this is our team, essentially.
 So Andrew Litchfield and Stephen Sveta comprise Assisi Holdings.
 These are two real estate
 professionals who have a variety of portfolio of properties and within them properties that deal specifically with social services like the one we're proposing tonight, as well as other properties as well, market rate and the like.
 They had previously worked with one of our providers, and that's Taisha Gushard.
 And Taisha has worked with a number of non-profits within the state dealing with shelter care, but also specifically with what we're proposing here, domestic violent care, particularly for women and typically young children.
 Taisha has worked with
 and her entity is called Pathway Alliance.
 She has worked with an organization called Justice for Housing.
 Justice for Housing is here tonight, led by Leslie Creedle.
 And Leslie brought one of her colleagues, Ruth Rollins, who does direct care, has been doing it for decades, I believe 30 years.
 So we have a real deep bench here to talk about the type of work we're doing, if that's what the board wants to hear about.
 Not here tonight, but provided in the materials that we've submitted to the board.
 is our engineer, Fasin O'Neill, who did a traffic review of the site.
 Our architect, Eric Zacherson, who provided the plans I'll share with you.
 Landscape architect, MDLA.
 And then there's myself and Maggie from Prince Lopel.
 And what we're proposing is the use I mentioned, we're calling it Halo House.
 And as mentioned by Danielle,
 The entitlement, the approval that we're seeking, site plan review is through the Dover Amendment that I'll walk through in a second.
 This is the site here at 21 St.
 Clair Road.
 It's next to, perhaps you'll recall, a somewhat newish condo development across from the parish center.
 It's sitting on a 5,396 square foot parcel.
 with an existing gross square floor area of just under 13,000.
 Previously used as a convent and also listed as a boarding house.
 Previously, it was a religious use and I would suspect it also came under some form of Dover amendment.
 But it's interesting, I looked at the property and the land itself was already subdivided and predates the zoning code, which in Medford is fairly early, 1925.
 Yes.
 And this site is 1924.
 The building itself was improved on the property in
 1956.
 And I just thought this was interesting.
 The name of the road used to be called Love Lane.
 I just saw that when I was grabbing the documents.
 This is the existing structure.
 As you can see, it sits really tight on the property line.
 There's not a lot of space.
 And one of the reasons why I went to the history of the site is that this is not a case where we're showing up and finding just an empty parcel of land and we could build anything there.
 What we're dealing with is an existing condition that we're inheriting that has been in place
 as a building since 1956, as a parcel since 1925 or 1924.
 So we're taking an already subdivided, non-conforming structure, parcel, and trying to make a
 a use of the parcel, but also very closely following in what was previously there, at least in use, in terms of the impact and what have you.
 So I also want to just point out that even though there is almost no land to work with around this parcel and in this building, what is there is not really
 I don't know, utilized to the fullest and to the best.
 I mean, you can see the side of the building there.
 It's kind of an area for trash toters to be stored.
 The front doesn't have any kind of plantings.
 As you can see, you don't see bushes or trees or anything around the site.
 So there are things you could do, but it's just a very tight site.
 And this is the front of it.
 There's also no
 Sidewalk on this parcel, which we're proposing to add in front of our building.
 As you can see here again, this is the front of the building.
 And, you know, whether.
 it goes to the sidewalk, when it goes to this road, formerly Love Road, now St.
 Clair, we received a report from the Public Works Department saying that this is a private road, and it may be, but everything we've seen says that this is a public road.
 Medford's own street book lists it as a public road, and we did some other looking in the Registry of Deeds, and it was referenced as a public
 roadway by by recently developed projects.
 So, I mean, I didn't do the full title examination, we could, but it seems to me that is a public road, and would invite a sidewalk and and and parking in front.
 This is the site plan, again, you can see how tight it is on that parcel really built out to the edge.
 And yeah.
 So I'm going to show you these plans really quickly.
 This is the existing plans.
 The existing setup is a 27, 29 room, depending on how you count the rooms.
 former convent with these rear rooms, as you can see here, this community, this cafeteria on the first floor, this chapel on the second floor, this community room on the third floor.
 Okay, and that's the fourth floor.
 Um, as being kind of open spaces, and then you see this large, uh.
 Classroom on the 2nd floor here, this is the existing conditions.
 Okay.
 And what we're going to be proposing, I'll show you in a moment here.
 These are the existing elevations and again, I'm going to show you what we're proposing here in a moment.
 All right, here's what we're proposing.
 So we took those back rooms, that classroom, and that chapel, and that other larger spaces, and are able to put rooms in those spaces.
 And then that classroom along the second floor, we're able to divide that.
 and create 37 rooms for this facility now.
 And as you can see, these rooms have adjoining doors.
 And the reason why they have adjoining doors is because many of our clients who will come to this facility may have young children.
 You know typical age and we can talk more about this are toddlers but they might go all the way up into the to the young teens or teenagers but typically you'll see younger children with their mother.
 And in such a case where you might have, say, you know, a brother and sister or two brothers or something, there might be what would be appropriate would be to have an adjoining room next to the mother's room.
 And that's what we can do with these configurations.
 There's a lot of flexibility for that with these various rooms.
 There's also a tremendous investment in this building.
 This building needs to be fully upgraded with all new systems, all new mechanicals, all new safety devices, and it needs new HVAC systems, new floorings, new
 a lot of renovation on the inside.
 We're predicting that the renovation costs will be 800 to a million dollars on the interior of this building, as well as some minor work to do on the exterior.
 There is no change to the envelope of this building.
 The building is staying exactly the same.
 On the fourth floor,
 Yes let me make one other point this first floor is really where all the education and classrooms and discussions and job training and.
 even areas for children to play, will be used.
 Lots of flex space, a lot of ability to use that first floor in that regard.
 And then each floor has a corner room, which is a flex room in its own self that can be used as an office or as a
 Kind of alternative room, but it could also be used as a room if it's needed.
 And that's on the floors.
 Uh, 2, 3 and 4 room 14 room 27 and room 40. so those are 3 additional rooms.
 Um.
 So, we can talk more about the activities that occur there and then on the exterior of this.
 building, what are we going to do?
 We're going to remove the cross and the birds.
 We will replace, we will, you know, point and repair the bricks, repair the windows, replace some if needed.
 We'll be adding a signage to the front door that says Halo House.
 you'll see there that there is a lift to be proposed on the front entry and really that's the only substantially noticeable change to the front and to the really to all the elevations of the building except for this is that right side of the building and then on the left side of the building what we'd like to do here based on some of the comments we've received from staff
 Is to create a path of accessible travel here.
 So we have a redundant travel.
 We have a lift in the front, but we also have a ramp along the side of the building at construction level drawings.
 We will.
 have to do a little bit of work on this ramp.
 Ramps require a railing and they require a flat period for just a certain section of the ramp.
 Our architect will do that, but this was something that we at this level are just describing as a ramp.
 And we'll have to flush it out a little bit more when we get to construction level drawings.
 Okay, and then landscaping, I mentioned that there's very sparse, not a lot of plantings or anything happening on the site here.
 We're proposing, I believe, over approximately 50 plantings, trees, bushes, and the like along the front of the building, along the sides of the building, and then creating spaces and areas for people to gather.
 So that space on the right side where you saw the toters earlier and the garbage barrels.
 those would be replaced with an exterior area for guests, for clients to gather, to recreate, to sit, to have a cup of coffee, to do whatever.
 And then in the back, the same type of area there.
 Now, one thing we don't have here and we're talking about, and it's something that came from our caregiving team, is to create some sort of play space.
 What we think we're gonna do is that area that you see is eight and nine there, that that would be turned into some play area for our kids.
 It's just basic kind of playground type equipment, nothing too sophisticated.
 There's not a lot of space there, but we might incorporate that section five into it as well.
 That's a little bit of a change that we're proposing here based on some of the conversations we've had recently as we prepared to be ready for this hearing and having conversations with our team.
 And this is just some more detail that we'll be fencing that are mentioned on our site plan and are in the plans.
 And these are the types of bushes and trees and foliage and the like that we'll be planting.
 So just, you know, in terms of the Dover Amendment, which is the name given to 40A section three, Daniel already mentioned it.
 There's just two qualifications here.
 One is the use, an accepted use under the Dover, under 40A3.
 And we submit that we are, we are a providing educational services.
 I can, I provided the, and then are we,
 Are we, what are the reasonable regulations concerning the structures themselves?
 And that section two, I said to you earlier, given the site, given the history of the site and given the plan, we are doing everything we can to make best use of it.
 We are not changing the size, the envelope of the site, if you will.
 And we are working as best we can to utilize the entire site.
 uh, within the confines of this pre-existing non-conformance structure and use.
 I provided a, uh, a more detailed, um, application with some, um, more detail on both of these points, uh, uh, prior to today's hearing.
 Um, but you know, um,
 And I'm just kind of pulling from the language of 40A Section 3 of this nonprofit use that would be educating as an education component.
 And I go a little bit deeper.
 To point out that, in fact, a use is essentially what we're providing a domestic violent shelter for women and children that's intended on providing life skills, job skills, some of just the very basic skills that people need to function and stand on their own is really the very essence of what an appropriate and acceptable use would be under the Dover Amendment.
 I want to tell you a little bit about the Pathway Alliance group, Taisha's group, and they are all available for questions.
 I imagine you'll have some for them.
 It's a really interesting group that I've gotten to know and meet through this process.
 They're dealing with
 So they have some very strict guidelines of their own.
 They see clients that are typically between six months and a year, and they do have a year as being the maximum time that they want to have any one resident staying in their facility.
 And one of the things that I learned from Leslie, who's going to be working with this group, is that they've had tremendous success with
 not seeing recidivism in their space.
 I think she has a 99% success rate, meaning that 99%, at least in the case of Leslie's efforts, clients have gone on to stable housing and not relapsed, which I think is a
 This is the work they do with their clients.
 They spend a lot of time getting their clients to stand on their own two feet so they can go out and apply for and have permanent housing.
 And this is the work that they do with their clients on a regular basis.
 So here with us today is Taisha from the
 I guess the from the pathway entity and working now with Leslie from justice for housing and then Ruth Rollins has brought in was brought in by Leslie Ruth has her own entity that she works with called we are better together.
 But Ruth also does direct service and has been in the.
 Has been in this, as I mentioned, for at least 30 years.
 1 of the groups that we're going to be working with is a group called RG reliable riders transportation company.
 This is a shuttle service.
 It's a van.
 The effort is to create 3 trips, or maybe more today to provide for the clients, but also provide for.
 employees the team understands that there is no parking at this facility the team will solve for that challenge they will solve for it for any of their staff who have parking needs we believe that those are maybe three or four people and they will find a area
 garage that may not be in Medford, it may be closer to transit, it may be some of the transit that they have.
 There's a lot of parking in those areas.
 And then the shadow will create predictability for these employees.
 In terms of clients, I'm told that
 No clients have cars, at least it's been the experience of all of our practitioners that clients do not come with their own cars.
 And so that solves an issue right there for us.
 So we feel confident and comfortable that the shuttle service will provide full access to and from the facility without needing to have on-site parking.
 And that being said, Andrew and Steve continue to talk to abutters and neighbors to see if there are opportunities, but so far there have not been.
 And again, we do not feel like that's necessary, but more we need to solve for some of the questions and some of the permitting questions that we've been asked during this process.
 And so we are trying to see if maybe we can even just have a couple of spaces nearby, even though we don't think it will be essential for the program.
 Go through this a little bit.
 I mean, there will be 24 hour security and there will always be a staff member on site at all times.
 Um, the facility provides on site, um, laundry services and, you know, food and meals as commercial kitchen.
 Um, and, um, and of course, sleeping, sleeping arrangements.
 Um, I'm going to skip over a couple of these items.
 Because I want to.
 available for questions if you have it.
 There's all kinds of classes, counseling, job counseling, meditation services, financial literacy classes, and the like.
 Other educational credit counseling services.
 I mentioned financial literacy coaching.
 This is what I wanted to show you.
 This is Justice for Housing.
 This is Leslie's entity right now.
 She has two
 buildings right now that she's operating.
 74 Morris Street in Dorchester and 241 Woodrow Ave in Dorchester.
 Both of these properties are right in residential neighborhoods.
 If you walk by them, you would think that they're just a regular house in Dorchester.
 They know their neighbors, they are active in their community.
 During the fall, there might be
 a pumpkin on the stair, you know, et cetera.
 These are people who are in this house all the time.
 And this was that stat that I heard from Leslie earlier.
 They have over 367 clients.
 Only 1% has needed to go back into temporary housing.
 The rest have really been able to get on their own feet.
 Tiesha has worked with all these other groups, as have the other two practitioners who are with us, Ruthie and Leslie, but Tiesha has worked with all these other groups in some capacity.
 She may be referring someone from the Pines Trident, she may be referring someone from St.
 Francis, Casa Merna, etc.
 The one thing I've heard from all the practitioners is that
 There are almost no domestic violence resources anywhere in Massachusetts.
 It's extremely hard to find any resource like this.
 There might be a scattered site here and there in someone's house separated from services.
 This is a very rare thing indeed.
 There are a number of rules associated.
 This will be a non-smoking facility.
 There's no alcohol, no drugs.
 These are very regimented facilities that are supervised and intended to help bring people into a healthy environment and get them into the right pathway.
 So now I want to shift from the use and just kind of close out here more on some of the physical attributes of the site.
 Some of the maybe even you might say shortcomings of the site, but that we're dealing with as a result and how we're dealing with those challenges as we are proposing here to you for site plan review.
 Um, so, uh, there is no parking.
 I mentioned that.
 Um, I also mentioned that most residents will not own their own vehicle.
 I believe all of the clients will not own their own vehicle.
 And in the case of those two or three staff members, I believe that we will be creating a shuttle service that will bring them to the facility.
 Um, there's ample MBTA services.
 Uh, there are always going to be an employee on site, but the total number of employees, not that many, five to six,
 And that during any one shift, there might be half of that.
 The I did want to just have this little graphic on the side that, you know, there is we do want to build a sidewalk off of our property.
 We don't have.
 We would provide those two to the city for approval.
 And we do believe this is a 61 foot frontage on the site we do believe that there would be space for at least two, maybe three, three cars on the front of the building.
 Yeah, so I do think practically speaking, pickup, drop off, you know, deliveries, those types of things, it's good to have some space to do that with.
 And that would be what that would be made available for.
 I mentioned there's ample parking and then, of course, the orange line and the shuttle will tie into these resources.
 We provided a traffic study from Fossil O'Neill engineers.
 This is, I just wanted to share with you, is that the way traffic studies work, as you've seen in your capacity as on this board, is they look at what the previous use was, they look at what the proposed use is, and they see what the difference is.
 Here, there is no difference because the previous use and the proposed use have the same impact based on what we're proposing, based on what was there.
 Uh, and that's, uh, we've provided this, this, um, memorandum from Faso O'Neill, and we're happy to, you know, uh, answer any questions about that.
 Uh, Faso O'Neill concludes that based on the foregoing assessment, it is the professional opinion of Faso O'Neill that the proposed development at 21 St.
 Clair will have negligible impacts on traffic operation within the study areas.
 Just finally, finally,
 Finally here.
 So there were a number of comments made from your various departments within Medford, by the way, it's been a pleasure to work with Medford and your various departments and your staff, and all of us for certain things and we are fully compliant to with all of these items that they've asked us to, of course, most of these things are going to have to happen once we get into the actual.
 work and the construction level documents.
 I mentioned the wheelchair ramp at the side entrance and some of the other items that I shared during the course of this presentation.
 So now might be, Madam Chair, a good time for me to pause and answer any questions along with the team as well.
 Thank you for the opportunity to be in front of you today.
 Thank you.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2024.899s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mèsi pou prezantasyon konplè a.
 Mwen apresye detay yo.
 Se konsa, pou bay tout moun yon lide sou sa li pral sanble, mwen pral louvri tablo nou an jiska kesyon ak kòmantè.
 Apre sa, pral gen yon peryòd kòmantè piblik.
 Revizyon Konsèy la ap swiv peryòd kòmantè piblik la.
 Apre sa, mwen vle pote nenpòt kesyon oswa kòmantè bay konsèy la.
 Manm konsèy la, tanpri, santi yo lib pou leve men ou oswa pou yo sispann.
 Adan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2062.907s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: Hey mesye.
 Mèsi pou entwodiksyon an, Michael.
 Jis yon kesyon sou sèvis edikasyon.
 Menm bagay la rive sitou ak pwofesè yo.
 Uh paske yo te afilye espesyalman ak 21 Clare Road, yo se yon pati nan yon òganizasyon ki pi gwo uh ak nan yon semèn bay ki jan sa travay oswa ki kalite pwosesis ou genyen?
 Atribye resous ansèyman nan yon pèspektiv fakilte pou reyalize objektif edikasyon ou dekri yo epi bay rezidan yo opòtinite.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2116.469s">[Mike Ross]</a>: Wi, mwen vrèman apresye kesyon an.
 Mwen panse ou ta jwenn yon pi bon repons si Leslie, Tasha, oswa Ruth reponn.
 Mwen pa konnen si youn nan nou vle pale sou kote ou ye nan kou ansèyman ak bagay konsa.
 Mwen pa konnen si se ou, Leslie, oswa mwen vle di, mwen ka eseye baze sou sa nou te pale sou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2139.85s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>: Lè sa a, mwen pa t 'kapab retire li.
 Se poutèt sa mwen pa reponn.
 Mèsi a dam konsèy la, anplwaye yo ak manm ki isit la aswè a pou pèmèt nou prezante.
 nou gen yon estrikti
 Sistèm edikasyon an vrèman konsantre sou devlopman mendèv ak fè moun tounen travay.
 Nou gen yon antrenè CDL ki gen lisans ki vini ak
 Nou gen tou yon eleman kote moun ka aprann ki jan yo enstale fenèt oswa panno solè.
 Sa kreye opòtinite travay pou patisipan nou yo.
 84% nan patisipan yo te achte
 Salè vivan pou yo ka gen mwayen lojman salè vivan san okenn asistans nan lojman piblik oswa nenpòt bagay konsa.
 Nou tou edike moun ak jwenn rezime, alfabetizasyon dijital, konpetans enfòmatik, ak bagay natirèl ke moun bezwen pandan y ap rebati lavi yo.
 Mwen ka di ke pi fò nan patisipan yo te viv lavi sa a
 sou sistèm pouvwa tankou byennèt ak sekirite sosyal, ak faktè ki anpeche yo jwenn aksè nan travay dirab.
 Se konsa, li se yon nouvo kòmansman.
 Anplis de sa, nou gen ladrès lavi.
 Mwen pa konnen si Ruthie oswa Tisha gen lòt bagay pou ajoute.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2284.71s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Si w gen pwoblèm pou dekole, tanpri fè Taisha konnen, mwen konnen w ap sou apèl la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2289.892s">[Taisha Gishard]</a>: Pafè.
 Wi, mèsi.
 Anplis de sa, wi, nou pral gen moun ki vin jwenn nou olye ke, ou konnen, kliyan oblije kite lokal la.
 Mwen sèten gen kèk bagay yo pral fè deyò, men pifò bagay yo pral sou plas.
 Se konsa, mwen espere ke mwen reponn kesyon sa a.
 Mwen mande si Ruthie gen yon lòt bagay pou ajoute?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2324.075s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Ruth Warrens.
 Wi, bon lannwit.
 Wi, wi, mwen espere ke mwen ka ajoute plis valè nan kesyon sa a.
 Donk, depandan popilasyon n ap travay avèk yo, enfòmasyon sou chòk yo ap disponib pou tout founisè ak patnè kominotè nou yo ki gen eksperyans k ap travay ak popilasyon sa a.
 Donk, ou konnen, nou pa sèlman pral ogmante alfabetizasyon finansye ak sipòte yo ak sèvis vyolans domestik, men nou pral travay tou ak timoun yo.
 Se konsa, twa nan nou gen doktè, sipò pou chòk ak sèvis vyolans domestik.
 An reyalite, nou deja gen sèvis ak patenarya ak lòt òganizasyon k ap fè travay sa a.
 Se konsa, nou jis vle bay sèvis konplè, otonòm pou tout fanmi an.
 Se konsa, nou pa ap reenvante yon bagay nouvo baze sou eksperyans nou nan travay sa a.
 Nou deja gen patnè sou entènèt k ap travay avèk nou ki pral vin travay ak kliyan yo.
 Objektif la se bay sèvis pou rezidan yo kote pwojè a ye.
 Se konsa, mwen espere ke mwen ka ajoute valè nan kesyon sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2400.317s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>: Wi, konsantre sou antretyen ak rebati.
 Se konsa, jan li te di, bati rezime w, konesans finansye ou, kredi ou se yon gwo obstak.
 Se konsa, nou vrèman konsantre sou bidjè, kredi, ki jan yo jere yon kont labank, ki jan yo ka resevwa yon ipotèk.
 Objektif nou se jwenn moun
 Abri pou lojman ki estab ak pwopriyetè kay.
 Sa a se wòl nou nan jistis lojman.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2438.402s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Adan, nenpòt lòt kesyon?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2446.665s">[Peter Calves]</a>: Mwen pa an bon sante.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2448.106s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mwen te wè de men sou tab la, epi mwen te panse mwen te wè men yon manm odyans lan.
 Yon rapèl rapid: sa yo se kesyon fowòm ak kòmantè kounye a, epi nou pral kontinye nan kòmantè piblik yo.
 Ari, mwen panse pwochen bagay mwen te wè se men ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2464.962s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: Pafè.
 Mersi, Madanm Chairman, e mersi bann kandida ki’n kandida.
 Sa sanble yon gwo pwojè ki pral pote anpil benefis pou kominote a.
 Kesyon mwen an se reyèlman plis pou ofisyèl vil yo ak
 Mwen ta renmen li si ou ta ka di nou yon ti kras sou sa ki komen pou lekòl ki pa tradisyonèl (sa vle di pa kolèj, lekòl piblik, elatriye) nan Amannman Dover.
 Mwen devine sa a se yon kesyon komen.
 Se konsa, si ou ta ka bay kèk background, istwa, ak règ pou telespektatè nou yo, nou ta reyèlman apresye li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2505.635s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Byensir madam Chairman.
 Mwen te la lè ka a te mennen nou nan pwojè potansyèl sa a.
 Nou te rankontre ak Robin Stein, youn nan avoka nan KP Law, pou diskite sou fason yo pèmèt konpòtman sa a, si wi ou non.
 Lè avoka l 'te di, byen, sa ta dwe yon eksplwatasyon nan Dover, li te asire nou ke se aktyèlman yon fason trè komen ki kalite pwojè sa a pèmèt.
 Byenke sa a se pa kalite abri ki ouvri pòt li nan mitan lannwit, moun antre nan dòmi ak Lè sa a, kite pandan lajounen.
 Li pa nesesèman yon bagay nou pa pale sou.
 Sa a se kote moun ap viv ak kote yo bay sèvis sipò.
 Li te di ke sa a te jeneralman pèmèt nan Dover.
 Mwen pa t ', mwen pa t' peye atansyon sou jurisprudence a.
 Mwen pa sèten si sa a pral ede, men mwen panse ke avoka pleyan yo gen kèk jurisprudence pare pou site si sa nesesè.
 Nou kwè ke avoka nou yo ki di sa a se yon fason estanda pou pèmèt yon pwojè tankou sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2578.155s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Ari, èske w ta enterese tande enfòmasyon sa yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2581.076s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: Ou konnen, nou pa oblije li chak mo, men mwen ta renmen tande konfimasyon sa.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2589.82s">[Mike Ross]</a>: Wi, mwen vle di, ou konnen, petèt mwen mete Maggie sou pil la epi mwen mete ou nan pwoblèm, patnè mwen.
 Ki moun ki te pouswiv tout ka sa yo.
 Men, mwen vle di, mwen panse ke ou nan Medford, ou se pwobableman abitye ak Tufts rantre nan epi, ou konnen, aplike anba Amannman Dover.
 Men, aktyèlman konsèp la se menm bagay la.
 Li fèt pou rezon edikasyon.
 Kesyon an se si yon etablisman konsa ta
 Elijib.
 Mwen panse ke ka prensipal la se McLean Hospital, ke mwen sèten tout moun te tande pale de.
 McLean Hospital bay anpil nan kalite sèvis nou diskite isit la sou yon pi gwo echèl.
 McLean Hospital okòmansman te pèmèt etablisman li a sitiye pi pre Lincoln, mwen kwè.
 Petèt pa ki fèmen, men nan Massachusetts.
 Sa a se yon ka ki soti nan Massachusetts.
 Sa i en version parey MacLean ki nou’n site dan sa bann materyo ki nou’n anvoy ou, e sa i egzakteman sa ki’n ganny site, e sa i dernyen kalite lalwa konsernen dan sa domenn ki Lakour Siprenm in site e i kontinyen site.
 Pou rezon sa yo ak anpil lòt, mwen vle di, mwen pa konnen, Maggie, nan ki pwen mwen la, si ou,
 Maggie Roberts, avoka.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2679.811s">[SPEAKER_19]</a>: Mwen dakò ak sa Mike te di: gen yon kò antye nan jurisprudence, men li vrèman tout vini desann nan objektif edikasyon yo nan konsèp laj sa a.
 Mwen panse, ou konnen, se ka sa a e gen anpil lòt ka, wi,
 Gen pwogram rezidansyèl immersion kote yo anseye kliyan ki jan yo viv yon lavi pwodiktif epi rete endepandan.
 Mwen panse ke fraz sa a vle di ke edikasyon se yon konsèp laj.
 Wi, tankou Mike te di, ou kapab
 Wi, sa a se yon konsèp pi laj ki ale pi lwen pase lekòl tradisyonèl yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2740.403s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mwen te jwenn sitasyon sa a nan ka Fitchburg la trè itil ak saj.
 Kounye a li sou ekran pataje a.
 Mèsi pou repons konplè ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2755.651s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mèsi Ali.
 Peter, mwen wè men ou.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2760.853s">[Peter Calves]</a>: Wi, mwen gen yon kesyon pou m poze kandida a epi konfime kèk bagay.
 Kesyon pou aplikan yo se: Ki dimansyon sèvis edikasyon yo bay sou plas la?
 ou te kraze l epi
 Ansèyman èdtan pa jou?
 Oswa èske se pa yon modèl ki ka mezire kont yon bagay tankou sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2798.205s">[Mike Ross]</a>: Bon, mwen vle di, nou toujou nan kèk mwa nan ouvèti ak nou toujou bezwen bati enstalasyon an.
 nou bezwen
 Fòmèlman enplike ekip la epi envite yo fè travay la.
 Se konsa, petèt ou ta ka mande yo pale sou eksperyans yo nan lòt enstalasyon ak objektif yo ki baze sou nimewo kliyan nou yo, elatriye.
 Men, nou pwobableman sis mwa lwen ouvèti.
 Mwen jis vle mete kèk nan sa a nan parantèz si sa posib.
 Petèt, Ashley.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2838.915s">[Peter Calves]</a>: klere.
 Kòm mwen te di, mwen jis vle konprann seri sèvis edikasyon sit sa a ofri.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2848.302s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>: Wi, mwen ka di pa lòt kay o aza nou te genyen.
 Premyèman, pa gen de ka yo menm.
 Se pa tout moun ki gen menm pwoblèm sosyal, pa vre?
 Premyèman, nou gen administratè ka ki fè evalyasyon an, pa vre?
 Objektif nou se estabilize, answit edike, rekonstwi, epi konsantre
 Sou, kisa ou te di, deyò, ki jan yo kite kay la.
 Premyèman, nou gen administratè ka ki evalye bezwen yo.
 nou genyen
 Reyinyon chak mwa yo dwe reyinyon fanmi, nou gen yon reyinyon fanmi chak mwa epi apre nou gen yon reyinyon chak semèn sou devlopman mendèv.
 Sa depann de ki klas ou ye.
 Si w ap pran yon CDL, antre de fwa pa semèn.
 Sa rive chak jou si ou chaje panno solè ou yo.
 Chak jou sou sit entènèt la soti 9 pou 5.
 diferan
 Kou pwofesyonèl yo gen bezwen diferan.
 Nou fè alfabetizasyon dijital nan apremidi, twa fwa pa semèn.
 Edikasyon finansye, mwen te kapab kontinye.
 Fè edikasyon finansye
 Jan sa nesesè.
 Baryè kredi chak moun yo diferan, kidonk chak moun yo asiyen yon konseye ki detèmine konbyen tan yo bezwen pase ak moun espesifik sa a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2966.36s">[Peter Calves]</a>: klere.
 Sa a ban mwen, ki se ase pou mwen, omwen pou konpreyansyon mwen sou pwogramasyon.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2980.463s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: nenpòt lòt kat
 Kòmantè oswa kesyon?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2984.459s">[Peter Calves]</a>: Oh, tann yon minit.
 Mwen reyalize te gen yon lòt bagay.
 Youn nan yo se tou senpleman konfimasyon St. Clare Road, omwen nan jiridiksyon otowout Depatman Transpò Massachusetts la, Highway Inventory Map, ki se travay jounen mwen an kòm yon enjenyè trafik, nou itilize li pou detèmine jiridiksyon St. Clair Road.
 Clare Road klase kòm yon wout piblik kidonk sa sipòte reklamasyon aplikan an e se yon bagay nou bezwen adrese.
 Mwen panse ke kesyon an se, oh, tann, non.
 Mwen ta renmen di, mwen gen yon kesyon pou anplwaye vil la sou ki opsyon yo genyen konsènan Amannman Dover.
 Men, mwen panse ke Avoka Ross te fè yon bon travay revize yo.
 An reyalite, mwen ekri yo nan nòt mwen yo.
 Se konsa, mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3043.403s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Bon, mèsi Pedro.
 Èske Konsèy la gen nenpòt lòt kòmantè oswa kesyon?
 Mwen jis te vle pataje kèk panse anvan ou antre nan peryòd kòmantè piblik la.
 Mwen wè gen anpil moun ki sou apèl aswè a, donk mwen pral kout.
 Mwen renmen ke ou mansyone ajoute yon twotwa devan bilding lan.
 Sepandan, sa a kite yon gwo diferans ant Street Corner ak St.
 Clare Road Building.
 Sa a se yon bagay mwen ta renmen aprann plis sou, oswa petèt nou ka defini tèm nou yo.
 Pakin se toujou yon pwoblèm nan Medford.
 Kòm yon vil, nou ap travay di pou asire w ke nou ap fè bon bagay pou fè sa.
 Mwen te yon ti kras konsène aprann ke solisyon an pakin te toujou nan devlopman.
 Mwen te tande kòmantè ou yo sou otobis yo epi sa a ka plis nan yon pwoblèm anplwaye vil la, men mwen ta enterese konnen ki règleman pakin oswa restriksyon (si genyen) kounye a ki egziste nan St.
 claire oswa si jis youn
 Wild West la, menm jan ak wout nou yo nan Medford.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3117.738s">[Mike Ross]</a>: Mwen sèten mwen panse ke ekip la te anba enpresyon ke sa a se te yon zòn wout prive yo wè li soti.
 Li sètènman sanble konsa.
 Mwen pa blame yo paske yo panse se egzakteman sa ki te pase.
 Ou konnen, mwen panse ke nou ta renmen sipòte vil la nan mete yon twotwa devan bilding lan.
 Mwen imajine nan yon pwen.
 Ou konnen, vil la ta ka vle envesti kèk resous kapital nan mete twotwa yo la, byenke se ta desizyon vil la, men mwen panse se sa omwen.
 Frape twotwa nou an.
 Nou ka fè pati nou pou sipòte efò sa a, nou ka kreye tranzisyon apwopriye tounen nan nivo tè, ou konnen, si se tactile bandes sou tou de bò, men Depatman Travo Piblik vle nou fè sa.
 Lè sa a, lè lòt lari yo pare, ou konnen, lè lòt twotwa yo pare, li pral travay.
 Men, mwen panse ke li ta twò koute chè yo konsidere bati yon twotwa antye soti nan bò sa a nan kwen an
 Genyen tou kèk lojistik ak vwazen.
 Li jis mete nou nan yon wòl konplètman diferan ak seri pri ke nou pa prepare pou fè.
 Men, an repons a kòmantè sa a, nou te dakò pou louvri twotwa a devan etablisman nou an.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3200.055s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mwen apresye kòmantè sa yo.
 Mwen te wè Direktè Hunter leve men l.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3206.804s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Mersi madam Chairman.
 Li plis oswa mwens sou tout la, twotwa yo, pati ki aksesib yo.
 Mwen panse ke nou reyèlman bezwen konnen si vil nou an konsidere sa a yon wout prive.
 Si se yon wout piblik, nou bezwen enspekte li epi konnen lajè li.
 Si nou ta ka gen yon twotwa kote li ye, Lè sa a, evidamman pa ta gen yon twotwa sou lòt bò a.
 Li jis matche ak yon pakin.
 Li nan enterè nou pou nou konnen ou pi byen.
 Li evidan, nou pa pral jwenn repons lan aswè a.
 Te gen anpil retounen ak lide sou pwoblèm patikilye sa a.
 Si sa a te yon wout piblik ki pa gen twotwa, men te gen espas, Lè sa a, mwen imajine depatman transpò ak jeni nou yo ta bezwen twotwa tout wout nan twotwa a, pa sèlman devan pwòp pwopriyete yo.
 Sa a ta dwe yon lòd estanda si espas te egziste.
 Sa sou kote, mwen pa panse ke pwoblèm sa a pral rezoud aswè a.
 Pwoblèm nan kote ta ka gen kèk fòm pakin piblik se ke tout wout piblik nou yo ouvè a piblik la.
 Pa gen anyen devan kay yon moun ki prive sof si se sou yon wout prive.
 Mwen pral mansyone, sepandan, si ou travèse Fulton Street, padon, Fells Way West,
 Lòt bò Fulton Street, detire Fulton Street anfas Gillis Park, gen pakin sou tou de bò.
 Nou te dekouvri ke moun ki soti nan bilding lan nan kwen Gillis ak Hickey Park te pake nan lari sa a.
 Anjeneral gen pakin nan lari la.
 Si nou ap pale de de a twa anplwaye,
 Pa gen okenn rezon ki fè yo pa t 'kapab pake lòt bò a nan Fellsway West epi mache yon blòk oswa de nan travay yo.
 Mwen panse ke sa a fè sans.
 Mwen panse ke an jeneral konsantre nou sou pakin se pou machin rezidan yo.
 Dapre sa mwen konprann, moun ki san kay yo gen tandans pa gen machin sof si yo ap viv nan yo.
 Sa a se kote yo te anvan yo rive nan abri a.
 Yon lòt pwen se ke si yon moun viktim vyolans domestik, sa pa nesesèman vle di ke li gen yon ti revni.
 Yo gendwa bezwen ale nan yon abri paske yap kouri kite yon moun, men sa pa vle di yo pa gen machin.
 Alor mon krwar lorganizasyon i vreman bezwen konsidere sa akoz napa long term parking pour bann vehikil rezidansyel.
 Youn nan kondisyon yo pwopoze a nan plizyè bilding, ak sa nou te fè pou bilding apatman pèfòmans segondè nou yo kèlkeswa kalite bilding,
 Lokatè yo pa kalifye pou yon pèmi pakin rezidansyèl.
 Sa a se tou yon kondisyon pou ka sa a yo dwe mete an pratik.
 Mwen konprann pa gen okenn pèmi pakin kounye a nan kominote sa a.
 Sa vle di p'ap janm gen yon pèmi pakin.
 Sa a ka a nan tan kap vini an, tou depann de dire a nan konstriksyon.
 Se konsa, mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3411.653s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>: Èske mwen ka antre byen vit?
 Kounye a nou gen yon kay vyolans domestik ki gen 22 chanm, e okenn nan patisipan nou yo pa posede machin.
 Nan twa kay nou posede yo, pa gen yon sèl rezidan posede yon machin.
 Si ou gen yon machin, jan nou te mansyone anvan, nou gen yon bis ki vini nan etablisman an twa fwa pa jou pou mennen ou nan estasyon tren an, epi nou bay ou ak yon pas T.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3449.56s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Sa a se enfòmasyon trè itil.
 Mèsi Leslie.
 Apre sa, mwen pral louvri yon peryòd kòmantè piblik.

 Ou kapab tou voye yon imèl TOC ou a nan: medford-ma.gov.
 Anvan bay kòmantè ou yo, tanpri bay non ou ak adrès ou pou anrejistreman.

 Oke, mwen byen kontan ke sesyon aswè a te trè enfòmatif.
 Mwen mande pou Konsèy la kontinye fè odyans pou revize.
 Materyèl pou konferans ekspè aswè a.
 Pwopriyete a tou gen yon akò kontra restriksyon konsènan itilizasyon edikasyon.
 Èske ou te resevwa apwobasyon alekri nan men pati a pou itilize zouti a?
 Mwen gen anpil kesyon men mwen dezapwent mwen sèlman gen de minit paske sa a te pase pou lontan ak de minit pa ase.
 Mwen se yon vwazen dirèk.
 Pwopriyete mwen an nan lis kòm Lot 22.
 Mwen ta renmen eksplike ke pakin se pwoblèm prensipal la nan kominote nou an, sekirite an dezyèm.
 Yo pwopoze yon pasaj pou pyeton devan bilding lan.
 Pa gen moun ki mansyone ke te gen yon bouch dife la e ke li te aktyèlman yon chape dife.
 pa gen anyen ekstèn
 Chape nan dife a, te gen 40 chanm, epi ou pral aprann aswè a gen kounye a 37 chanm, ki se diferan pase plan an yo te pwopoze orijinal la.
 Epi pa gen asansè.
 Gen de chanm nan premye etaj la, ki ka itilize pa moun ki gen mobilite redwi.
 Perimèt yon bilding.
 Gen kat pye sou bò gòch kote ranp antre bò pwopoze a ta pase.
 Ki jan timoun yo rive nan estrikti lokal sa a?
 Kwen an se tout lajè bò gòch la nan bilding lan kont kloti a lyen chèn, plis pase kat pye.
 Longè nan do a se yon mèt ak yon mwatye, ogmante a de mèt nan kwen dwat la.
 Mwen ta renmen montre yon pwoblèm ak planifikasyon an.
 Sal Planifikasyon 6789,
 Li sanble gen de nivo.
 Epi sa a pa ase tan, epi li se yon eksplikasyon ki pa akseptab.

 Kidonk mwen menm ak saint la sou menm bò a.
 Francisco ak Ridgway.
 Pou twazyèm fwa nan yon ranje.
 Se konsa, mwen gen kèk kesyon.
 Mwen swete mwen te kapab vizite yo.
 Mwen ta renmen jwenn kèk repons nan men yo sou yo.
 Mwen ta renmen konnen ki kantite maksimòm w ap pale a.
 Ou te di se te yon abri ki ka akomode 40 moun.
 Se konsa, aswè a nou dekouvri sa a se yon abri vyolans domestik e mwen konprann moun bezwen yon kote ki an sekirite men 40 rezidan nan kominote sa a ki gen anpil moun, oswa 40 granmoun ak nenpòt kantite timoun?
 Mwen ta renmen konnen ki kantite maksimòm lokasyon an.
 Mwen konnen Dover se yon amannman edikasyon solid.
 Franchman, lè nou konsidere sa ki yon zòn ki gen anpil moun nan Fulton Heights te vin tounen, li se yon ti kras malonèt konpare li ak McLean Hospital, ki chita sou gazon yo woule nan Belmont.
 Plizyè kay sou Fulton Street kounye a se inite lokasyon ki estasyone nan Ridgeway, St.
 Francis Road ak Fulton Spring Road se wout prive epi kenbe wout sa yo an bon kondisyon fè vil nou an pa bon.
 Nou trè konjesyone e franchman mwen ta renmen konnen lè yo fè yon etid trafik.
 Mwen dakò ak moun ki rete St Louis.
 Clare, paske se legliz pawas mwen an e se yon chape pou dife.
 Pou kèk mès yo toujou di nan legliz Sen Jan.
 Pawas Francesco, kisa ki pral rive samdi ak dimanch si Bondye padon gen yon dife epi kamyon ponpye yo pa ka pase paske gen yon pakin ak yon pasaj ki mennen nan ansyen kouvan an?
 E pou di ke itilizasyon yo se egzakteman menm bagay la tou, anvan tout bagay, bilding sa a te vid pou moun ki konnen konbyen ane.
 Konpare ak 15 oswa 18 mè ki abite la, ki pa janm gen machin oswa anyen, eksepte kounye a gen anplwaye a plen tan 24 èdtan pa jou, 365 jou pa ane, li trè malonèt ak malonèt pou moun nan Medford yo ke yo pral bay yon abri pou viktim vyolans domestik nan yon zòn ki gen anpil moun.</p>

 Nou te rete nan 463 Fellsway West ak pòt devan mwen an te fè fas St.
 Chemen Clara.
 Ankò, mwen pa si sou rechèch trafik ou te fè.
 Mwen gen menm pwoblèm ak antre kay la ak ki jan ti li ye.
 Gen sèlman yon ti chemen ant pòt dèyè legliz la ak Bazilik Sen Pyè a.
 Ri Francisco.
 Apre sa, nou te gen de kote sa yo pake sou pwopriyete lòt moun, approx.
 10 pye lajè pou trafik k ap pase.
 Kòm yon rezilta, pakin ak trafik nan zòn nan pral sètènman afekte.
 Mwen konnen ou di moun pa pral kondui al travay, moun pa pral gen machin nan abri a, men mwen deja wè ke de espas ke nou genyen yo, paske nou pa ka pake devan kay la, epi nou pa ka pake bò kay la, yo pral afekte.
 Mwen enkyete tou pou rive nan yon abri pou moun ki san kay ki toupre.
 Nou fèk konstwi apatman sa yo kèk ane de sa, ki vrèman ogmante popilasyon an, itilizasyon dlo ak tout lòt bagay nan katye a.
 Mwen fristre anpil.
 Mwen gen yon pitit gason ki gen bezwen espesyal.
 Li trè twoublan lè sa rive

 Mwen gen 58 ane epi mwen se yon rezidan tout lavi nan Method.
 Mwen te travay pou depatman polis vil la pandan 24 ane.
 Mwen retrete.
 Mwen posede tou yon biznis nan vil la.
 Enkyetid mwen se sekirite bilding nan.
 Avèk kat apatman yo te genyen, mwen te resevwa anpil apèl.
 Si yon bagay ale mal nan twazyèm, dezyèm, twazyèm oswa katriyèm etaj la, èske gen yon asansè oswa èske sèvis ijans yo gen pou monte kat eskalye?
 Èske tout bilding lan konfòme ADA?
 Mwen panse ke kòm yon enstitisyon edikasyon li ta dwe konfòme ADA.
 Li te sou tout etaj la.
 Se konsa, mwen vle jwenn yon repons a kesyon sa a.
 Mwen vle tou konnen poukisa etid trafik la, sitwayen ki tou pre yo pa ka wè etid trafik la.
 Mwen vle eseye ranvwaye li nan lavni paske mwen vle konsilte ak yon avoka epi fè li gade nan yon etid trafik.
 Mwen mande tou si li pral apwouve ADA.
 Mwen enkyete pou dife a ak timoun yo nan bilding lan.
 Si yon bagay rive nan etaj anwo a, yo oblije rete tann pou sèvis ijans yo monte nan twazyèm oswa katriyèm etaj la. Ki jan yo pral sove yo?
 Enkyete.

 Mèsi paske w ban m opòtinite pou m pale.
 Pwopozisyon an sanble gwo e mwen panse ke li ka ajoute anpil valè nan kliyan an si egzekite byen.
 Men, kòm yon pati nan kominote kote abri a ye, mwen enkyete sou dirab alontèm nan pwojè a.
 Mwen vle tou asire w ke pa gen okenn enpak negatif alontèm sou kominote a.
 Se poutèt sa, mwen ta renmen mete aksan sou de pwen.
 Premye a tout, jije nan enfòmasyon sou entènèt, pwopriyete a se posede pa yon pwomotè byen imobilye.
 Ki moun ki gen entansyon pwofi nan pwopriyete a, ki pral jere pa yon konpayi ki rele Pathway Alliance, ki mwen te dekouvri se sèlman twa mwa e li te fonde pa yon ajan imobilye.
 Mwen panse ke li fasil pou ekri yon pwopozisyon ak non non ladan l, men pi difisil pou egzekite.
 Dezyenmman, i ganny propoze ki servis transpor i ganny donnen, me san pakin, e ki i annan plis akse direk avek transpor piblik.
 Èske abri yo ka vrèman akonpli objektif edikasyon yo pou ede kliyan yo refè?
 Donk, dapre de pwen sa yo, si mwen te kapab mande Konsèy la, li ta dwe konsidere enplikasyon alontèm pou pèmèt Amannman Dover aplike isit la.
 Asire mekanis yo anplas pou rann aplikan yo ak operatè yo responsab pou yo kontinye sèvi ak objektif edikasyon yo.
 Jan mwen konnen, pa gen okenn dosye sou li kontinye sèvi objektif sa a alontèm.
 Se tout.
 Mwen remèsye konsèy la pou koute m.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4611.546s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mèsi Kevin.
 Nou apresye tan ou.
 Esteban Angeloni.
 Mwen wè gen de nan nou.
 Ou chak vle pale?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4625.193s">[SPEAKER_16]</a>: Mwen panse sa.
 Mwen pral eseye fè kout.
 Mwen se Iga Angeloni ak Stephen Angeloni.
 Nou nan First Street.
 Blòk apatman nan kwen Clare Road.
 Mwen panse ke nou tout pataje menm kesyon an sou si amannman an Dover ap aplike yon fason apwopriye oswa twò lach.
 Osi lwen ke mwen konprann, jis paske
 Òganizasyon san bi likratif yo pa otomatikman ba w pwoteksyon anba Amannman Dover sof si sous prensipal pou sèvi ak etablisman an se edikasyon.
 I paret mwan ki sous prensipal sa fasilite pou selter, ledikasyon i en konponan, petet i form parti sa planifikasyon, malgre mon admet, i enpe vag e i ankor sis mwan ale, donk i pa vwar li ankor totalman devlope.
 Mwen devine mwen vle repete pwen Lisa ak kèk lòt pwen sou enpak Kevin sou kominote a.
 Mwen panse ke an jeneral, nou ap sètènman konsène sou chanjman nan sekirite, konjesyon, pakin, ak sou sa.
 Men, kòm yon abri pou viktim vyolans domestik, mwen devine mwen tou konsène sou vyolans domestik, sou moun ke mwen konsidere kòm viktim,
 Chape soti nan dekouvri zòn sa a ta ka ogmante, mwen pa konnen, danje a isit la.
 Mwen yon ti kras kirye sou sekirite.
 Ou mansyone gen gad sekirite nan anplwaye, men ki sa sa vle di aktyèlman?
 Ki sa egzakteman sa vle di?
 An jeneral, mwen yon ti kras enkyete sou efè alontèm sou moun nan nou ki pase nan espas sa a chak swa.</p>

 Non mwen se Miguel Ruiz.
 Mwen rete nan 45th Street.
 Francis Street, jis dèyè Abita.
 Ebyen, mwen panse mwen enkyete sou enpak sa pral genyen sou kominote a, menm jan ak anpil nan vwazen mwen yo.
 Oke, men mwen menm tou.
 Kesyone validite lwa Dover a.
 Mwen vle di, nan pwogram edikasyon an, mwen te konnen mwen te yon fonksyonè sivil pou tout lavi.
 Kòm yon machann mwen ka di, nou bezwen fòme mendèv la paske nou ap pèdi yo, men mwen pa wè ki jan ou ka fòme yon moun pou fè yon CDL de jou pa semèn.
 Ki jan yo fè sa nan yon pakin ak yon lari k ap pase ladan l?
 Enstale panno solè se ankò yon bon lide, men èske yo pral pann yo sou bilding lan?
 Mwen vle di, gen yon limit nan kantite travay ou ka fè nan klas la.
 Anpil ladan yo se fòmasyon nan travay la ki bezwen ranpli.
 Lòt enkyetid mwen an se kominote a an jeneral.
 Mwen konprann nati imen.
 Moun pa vle tann pou ferry la.
 Yo pral an reta pou travay.
 Yo ka kondwi.
 Yo pral pake nan St Louis.
 Ri Francisco.
 St Pa gen pakin.
 Francis Street se sa li ye kounye a, gras a kay pou lokasyon ak apatman nan Fulton Street.
 Koulye a, anpil nan pwopriyete yo plizyè fanmi isit la chaje ak lokatè.
 Yo lwe chanm.
 Li kout je sou pati vil la pou pèmèt sa.
 Men, mwen pa panse ke plan sa a ap janm reyèlman bon.
 Mwen pa panse yo pral rezoud pwoblèm nan pakin.
 Mwen panse ke tout pwoblèm edikasyon an trè nebuleux.
 li jis itilize
 Pou pwoteje moun.
 Kòm Mesye Huang fè remake, lè konplo an patikilye sa a pa soutni tèt li ankò, ki sa ki pral pwochen itilizasyon bilding lan?
 Ki sa nap ouvri tèt nou?
 Sa yo se tou kèk nan enkyetid yo nan vwazen yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4860.138s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mèsi pou tan ou.
 Mèsi Michael.
 Mwen apresye kòmantè ou a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4871.505s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Next moute se Angus Ho.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4876.686s">[SPEAKER_38]</a>: Bonjou, wi, non mwen se Pangas Ho.
 Mwen rete nan St.
 Clair Condominium, ki chita nan menm lari ak bilding lan.
 Kidonk mwen ta renmen ajoute nan sa lòt vwazen mwen yo te mansyone, ke mwen ta mande konsèy la pou vrèman envestige motivasyon devlopè yo.
 Ou konnen, se konsa mwen te fè kèk rechèch ak, ou konnen,
 Pwomotè a se yon pwomotè rezidansyèl liks nan Somerville, Cambridge.
 Lè sa a, tou akòz kontèks istorik la, nou te konnen ane pase yo ke yo te pral konvèti bilding nan nan nèf apatman kondominyòm pou vann piblik la.
 Lè sa a, nou te dekouvri ke paske yo te kontakte asosyasyon pwopriyetè kay nou an pou lwe yon espas pakin nan kondo nou an, yo pa t 'kapab ranpli kondisyon yo ki nan zòn nan paske yo pa t' kapab jwenn yon kote pou pakin pou kondo a.
 Finalman nou pa t lwe espas pakin nan ba yo.
 Kòm yon rezilta, pwojè kondo liksye a pa ka avanse.
 Kounye a yo te transfòme pwojè sa a nan pwojè abri sa a.
 Kòm Kevin te mansyone tou, yo te kreye òganizasyon san bi likratif sa a pou dirije pwogram nan
 Abri a gen twa mwa sèlman e li te kreye apre tantativ yo te fè pou konvèti li nan apatman liksye.
 Men, sa pa t rive, e se pa lè sa a yo te kreye san bi likratif sa a pou konstwi abri a.
 Ankò, mwen ta reyèlman ankouraje konsèy la pou konsidere motivasyon yo isit la, paske enkyetid mwen an se dirab alontèm si devlopè yo isit la yo kondwi sèlman pa pwofi.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4987.158s">[Emily Lazzaro]</a>: Bonjou, mèsi.
 Non mwen se Emily Lazaro.
 Mwen rete nan 170 Mystic Street Extension.
 Mwen se yon Manm Konsèy Vil Medford.
 Mwen ta renmen eksprime sipò mwen pou pwojè sa a.
 Mwen apresye òganizasyon sa yo k ap travay kòm yon kowalisyon pou fè sa rive.
 Mwen se youn nan pwòp mwen yo
 Travay jounen travay nan Malden Warming Center.
 Mwen pran swen pwofondman sou moun ki fè fas ak kalite bagay sa yo.
 Jwenn yon kote yo rete trè difisil, espesyalman pou moun ki gen timoun.
 Òganizasyon mwen an pa kapab pran swen timoun yo kidonk sa ka patikilyèman difisil lè w ap fè fas ak yon sitiyasyon konsa. Mwen apresye konpasyon ou ak
 Devouman ak popilasyon sa a.
 Mwen ankouraje tou konsèy yo sonje ke toujou gen defi.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se pwopozisyon gwoup la
 Dokiman jwenti a byen konplè.
 Mwen panse ke li ka egzaminen, men mwen panse tou kounye a se yon moman pou nou dirije ak konpasyon epi eseye sonje ke pral gen desizyon difisil yo dwe pran e moun yo pral fè fas a yon anpil nan moman difisil epi si nou ka eseye ede lòt epi kontinye eseye.
 Jwenn yon fason pou youn ede lòt epi pou w gen konpasyon ak konpasyon.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se pi bon fason pou pi devan.
 Mwen ta fyè de Medford si nou ta ka itilize yon bilding vid tankou sa a pou itilizasyon li pwopoze.
 Mèsi.</p>

 Mwen abite nan 281 Park Street ak Alicia Hunter te di moun sa yo ka pake sou blòk sa a, men yo pa kapab paske gen twòp trafik.
 Nou pa ka sipòte ou.
 Mwen panse ke vwazen yo te fè yon anpil nan pwen reyèlman bon.
 Se yon ti wont ke konsèy vil la te dakò abandone tout pwen sa yo.
 Men konpayi an nouvo.
 Nou pa konnen si yo pral kapab reyisi nan pwojè sa a.
 Si pakin la twò difisil, yo ka sote pòsyon ansèyman an epi rete kole nan abri a.
 Olye de sa.
 Se konsa, deklarasyon Dover ke retabli asistans oswa ede yo ranpli fòm lojman ta fè sant la edikasyon se yon detire, paske se pa sa a.
 Si w bati yon abri sou twotwa a devan yon bilding, otobis abri w la p ap kapab vire.
 Sa a se yon zòn trè etwat.
 Se konsa, si pakin nan itilize,
 Yo p'ap ka vire toutotou.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke matematik yo pa kòrèk.
 Mwen mande tou sou elèv yo ki te deplase isit la.
 Èske y ap ale nan lekòl Medford?
 Èske sa se yon abri imigran?
 Èske tout moun bezwen sèvis ELL?
 Mwen sèten tout moun isit la konnen yè nou te apwouve de anilasyon paske lekòl nou yo akable.
 Nan mwa mas 2024, nou te ajoute 103 elèv ELL, men nou pa t kapab bay sipò.
 Donk, si se konsa, nou gen yon pwoblèm ankò.
 Mwen jis vle klarifye.
 Si yo pa gen repons pou kesyon sa yo, mwen mande konsèy la pou li pa avanse paske plan an poko devlope e yo pa prepare pou yo fè sa.
 Mèsi.</p>

 Mwen rete nan 25th Street.
 Francis Street ak kay mwen an te fè fas a pakin legliz la.
 Yon kesyon mwen genyen sou etid pakin lan se mwen pa fin sèten lè yo te fè etid la men mwen te wè pakin nan.
 Inyon ant antèman ak mas ak diferan fonksyon yo genyen nan sant sosyete a.
 Mwen enkyete pou sekirite timoun yo epi mwen pa gen yon lakou rekreyasyon reyèl pou timoun sa yo, mwen vle di, ou konnen, mwen konnen ou te pale sou bati yon ti lakou rekreyasyon oswa yon
 sou bò yon bilding oswa yon lòt kote.
 Men, timoun yo pa vle rete lakay yo 24/7.
 Yo pral vle ale epi yo pral ale.
 Ou konnen, se jis nati timoun yo.
 Epi, ou konnen, si gen yon anpil nan machin k ap vini ak ale, yon timoun ka jwenn frape oswa, ou konnen, ka blese mòtèl.
 Mwen vle di, ou konnen, se yon enkyetid.
 Ou konnen, definitivman pral gen yon ogmantasyon nan trafik pou kamyon manje ak sèvis transpò ke w ap pale de yo.
 Ankò, yon risk sekirite.
 Mesye, mwen se yon enfimyè retrete, youn nan travay mwen te nan asistans, mwen te travay la pandan uit ane anvan mwen pran retrèt.
 M ap rekrite ak pwograme travay, epi ou konnen, li trè difisil pou jwenn anplwaye ki kalifye epi kenbe yo.
 Ou konnen, mwen enkyete pou ekip la la 24/7.
 Men, sa k ap pase nan wikenn yo lè administratè ka yo pa travay nan wikenn yo?
 Jan mwen konnen, yo jeneralman pa fè sa.
 Lè sa a, ou konnen, e si, li sanble tankou nan wikenn yo, gen mwens anplwaye, kidonk pral gen pwoblèm ak moun k ap viv nan kay la?
 Sa a ka gen ladan lapolis, anbilans, ponpye, kèlkeswa ka a.
 Finalman, kesyon mwen an se: Kisa kominote a te konsidere anvan li te devlope tout plan sa a?
 Mwen pa sonje mwen te resevwa okenn enfòmasyon pa lapòs sou sa ki pral rive isit la.

 Mwen abite nan 97 Taft Street e mwen yon rezidan depi lontan nan Medford.
 Mwen jis te vle fè eko sa rezidan parèy mwen yo Fulton Heights te di sou bilding lan konfòme ADA ak pakin devan.
 Oke, sekirite, men tou enpak sou kominote a.
 Oke, kounye a ke nou jis pase kèk chanjman nan plis finanse lekòl nou yo, ki kote timoun sa yo aktyèlman pral finanse?
 Hmm.
 Epitou enterese nan aprann plis.
 An tèm de kantite total rezidan yo.
 Mwen konnen gen 40 chanm men si se yon doub, trip oswa kwadwilatè li ta bon pou pataje li avèk nou.
 Mwen li dokimantasyon an epi mwen pa wè anyen konsa.
 Kèk nan dokiman yo telechaje sou sit Google la se yon ti jan kontradiktwa ak sa yo te montre aswè a.
 Mon osi demann e defi Board pou fer due diligence lo sa zafer e pa pran parol bann avoka.
 Ou reprezante vil la ak rezidan li yo, kidonk nou espere ou fè travay ou epi ou pa kwè chak avoka paske yo di sa, epi ou li dokiman yo, menm pou yon san bi likratif ki se sèlman twa mwa.
 Mwen panse tou nou te gen yon eleksyon trè sere yè ak kat opsyon vòt nan vil Medford sèlman.
 Nou pral fè reyinyon sa a pwochen swa.
 Mwen santi mwen tankou yo mete sa a sou kalandriye a epi answit kache li pou rezidan yo pa ta fè kòmantè.
 Se poutèt sa, mwen panse anvan pran yon desizyon, pwograme yon lòt reyinyon pou yon jou ki pa jou apre eleksyon minisipal la.</p>

 Mwen abite nan 29 Francis Street, toupre bilding sa a.
 Kounye a, lè m te resevwa nouvèl ke yo te vann bilding sa a bay yon abri pou sanzabri, mwen te sezi anpil pa nouvèl la.
 Piske bilding lan piti, mwen pa kwè gen ase espas pou timoun ak fanm nan ti bilding sa a.
 Epitou, twotwa yo trè etwat epi pa gen okenn pakin piblik, espesyalman nan bilding sa a.
 Sa a ta ajoute anpil chaj ak pwoblèm nan lari ki antoure yo.
 Yon lòt bagay se kounye a
 Gen 40 moun k ap viv nan 40 chanm, prèske 40 fanmi, epi nou pa konnen konbyen nan yo pral viv isit la.
 Mwen ta ajoute anpil ensètitid nan avni kominote nou an.
 Mwen se yon nouvo rezidan.
 Mwen jis deplase kèk mwa de sa.
 Se konsa, lè mwen... anvan mwen te achte kay sa a, mwen te jwenn yon bèl kote, bèl bagay... li te yon bèl, trankil, katye lapè.
 Bon vwazen, lari trankil, ou konnen.
 Dèyè kay mwen an sanble yon legliz.
 Tout bagay se enkwayab.
 Se poutèt sa mwen te achte kay sa a.
 Se konsa, mwen santi mwen trè kontan, men...
 Lè m 'tande nouvèl la, li vrèman te ajoute yon anpil nan ensètitid nan lavni an nan fanmi mwen, kidonk mwen te trè enkyete.
 Alor mon ti pe demande ki mannyer pou repar sa pou nou santi nou pli an sekirite e vwazen nou an sekirite.</p>

 Sa a se yon gwo kominote.
 Mèsi a Konsèy la paske w pèmèt nou fè odyans sa a, ak Michael Ross ak ekip li a.

 Ou konnen, nou menm ki rete St Louis.
 Francisco Street S.
 Claire aktyèlman dekouvri sa jodi a.
 Ou konnen, se yon reyalite akonpli.
 Li evidan, nou mete anpil efò nan preparasyon ak prezantasyon.
 Se konsa,
 Mwen jis vle repete sa vwazen mwen yo Linda, Lee, Maggie, Wyman ak lòt moun te di.
 De bagay aswè a.
 Youn se an tèm de pakin, sekirite, enpak li genyen sou legliz la, St.
 Francis nan Assisi.
 Sa a se yon pati nan rezon ki fè nou te deplase isit la.
 Sa a se yon bèl legliz dwat dèyè kay nou an.
 Transpò, dlo, ak anpil lòt pa sanble yo dwe pran an konsiderasyon.
 Lòt pati a se gen yon anpil nan enkoni.
 Yon moun te pale de, se yon fason prive oswa yon fason piblik?
 Sa ka afekte bagay sa yo.
 Gen kèk ki di san bi likratif la se sèlman twa mwa.
 Konfòmite ADA.
 Gen twòp enkoni epi yo pa ase done.
 Finalman, mwen panse ke tout pwoblèm edikasyon an sanble se yon fot.
 Sa a sanble twonpe paske sa pa sanble yo dwe entansyon prensipal Halo House.

 Ann onèt, prèske pa gen plas pou yon twotwa devan bilding sa a paske se yon legliz, pa vre?
 Si ta gen yon kalite aksidan, yon dife, yon moun bezwen yon anbilans, machin sa yo t ap rann li trè, trè difisil pou ale nan nenpòt moun.
 se konsa mwen panse
 Piske plan an te montre sa sou yon bò, yo te panse yo ta mete yon ranp sou lòt bò a.
 Yo ta plante anpil ak anpil touf ak flè, epi tout bagay t ap bèl.
 Men, onètman, sanble pa gen espas.
 Kidonk, pou tout rezon sa yo, moun yo te pibliye popilasyon pakin yo, kisa popilasyon pakin yo ye?

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=6279.274s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Wi, mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=6280.695s">[Walid Elhirach]</a>: Oke, Walid Harash.
 Mwen abite nan 1 Sinclair Road.
 Donk mwen panse, anvan tout bagay, apre yo fin tande kòmantè tout moun, odyans sa a li menm se twò bonè.
 Daprè avoka a, dezole, mwen bliye non li, ak Leslie nan emisyon an, mwen panse ke li evidan ke yo pa t 'kouvri tout T yo, sa mwen te fè.
 Se poutèt sa, reyaksyon yo tou anpil.
 ak deklarasyon ki monte a "Mwen kwè sa a, mwen kwè sa a, mwen pa sèten, sa a toujou anba diskisyon."
 Sa a se pa yon plan.
 Se tankou fè yon volonte o aza nan yon sous dlo epi yo pote l 'bay kominote ki afekte a ki gen plis pase 100 moun oswa plis.
 Baze sou sa mwen te tande ak li nan pwopozisyon yo jiska prezan, yo te prezante plan sa a mwatye kwit ak ti kras oswa pa gen okenn panse.
 Epitou, mwen panse ke itilizasyon an antye nan Amannman Dover a tèlman ipokrit ke tande yo pale sou li fè m 'vèti.
 Pou site ka McLean tèt li, se tankou pi bon entèlijans moun mansyone pi wo a aktyèlman sitiye nan greenbelts ak kawo tè nan espas olye ke yo te longè yon bra a lwen yon kay oswa pwopriyete rezidansyèl nan tout direksyon.
 Lòt pase sa, mwen jis vle klarifye
 Premyèman, se te yon abri san kay ki te enkli nan yon pwopozisyon nan men yon konpayi byen imobilye ki te ap eseye pwofite sou li ak yon jan kanmenm anfòm li nan Amannman an Dover.
 Mwen panse ke Kevin oswa Payne te ka mansyone anvan ke menm konpayi an t ap eseye konvèti menm bilding lan nan apatman liksye epi yo te kontakte plizyè nan nou ap eseye achte oswa lwe pwòp pakin pa nou.
 Se konsa, mwen ta ankouraje konsèy la reyèlman fouye nan motivasyon ki dèyè pwojè sa a paske baze sou delè a, li trè klè sa devlopè yo ap eseye fè.
 Pati ki deranje m plis se:
 Ou konnen, kòm yon moun ki te leve pa yon manman selibatè nan yon kay pou viktim vyolans domestik, li se yon kalite degoutan yo wè pwopozisyon sa a, ki jan yo ap chanje pozisyon yo soti nan apatman liks nan eseye montre, site, abri pou moun ki san kay pou rezon edikasyon.
 So, ou konnen, mon ti zis demann sa board pou repran sa e donn nou plis letan e plis letan meeting pour nou reflesir plis e reflesir an plis detay avan nou pran en desizyon.
 Mèsi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=6425.48s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mèsi, Alida, e mèsi pou kòmantè vilnerab ou.

 Mwen rete nan 36th Street.
 Ri Francisco.
 Mwen te jwenn soti nan vwazen mwen an yè.
 Kòm yon vwazen, mwen pa te gen okenn lide sa a ta ka rive vwazen mwen an, ki se yon ti kras fwistre.
 Donk, anrapò ak Amannman Dover a, mwen panse ke li sanble mal ke avoka a te site, li di li te apeprè sis mwa ale, lè an reyalite li pa t ap site yon plan edikasyon, men yon plan espesifik, ki te objektif la nan eseye fè amannman sa a pase.
 Se konsa, pati sa a se fwistre, li nan sitou yon refij.
 Mwen enkyete pou sekirite nou.
 Potansyèl rezidan HALO ak pitit yo ak kominote a.
 Anplis de sa, pakin ak konjesyon se yon gwo pwoblèm nan zòn nan.
 Mwen pa tande anyen sou envite oswa vizite kominote a, men sètènman pou yon kay 40 chanm gen anpil chans pou gen anpil trafik nan zòn nan tou.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke ta dwe gen kèk konsiderasyon adisyonèl isit la.
 Li sanble ke se pa tout plan yo, menm plan yo pou bilding lan, ak konfòmite ADA yo te byen panse.
 Se konsa, mwen panse mwen pataje anpil enkyetid ak manm kominote a, e mwen panse ta dwe gen plis reflechi ak plis diskisyon sou sa a.</p>

 Jis ankouraje moun yo jwenn kèk pèspektiv.
 Bay ebèjman pou fanm ak timoun ki viktim vyolans domestik se klèman yon bon itilizasyon ak nòb espas ki limite sa a nan vil nou an.
 Sou figi a, sa a se yon bagay moun ta dwe sipòte.
 Lavi moun sa yo pi enpòtan pase pakin.
 Yo pi enpòtan pase ti bagay sa yo ki, ou konnen, evidamman ka rezoud pita.
 Se poutèt sa mwen sipòte abri yo epi ankouraje moun yo gade pi lwen pase pakin yo epi reflechi sou amelyore lavi yo.

 Èske mwen konprann oratè a kòrèkteman?
 Dapre prezantatè a, ou pral anseye kondwi komèsyal bay moun ki pa posede yon machin.
 Mon kestyon se si sa bann fasilite i ouver ozordi.
 Bliye lokatè oswa elèv, ki kote pwofesè a pral pake machin li oswa kamyon komèsyal li?
 E si yon kandida ta ka di nou ki vitès bis yo ap voye moun yon bò a lòt paske pa gen plas pakin, oswa si se sa ki nan yon etid transpò?
 Epitou, mwen ta renmen konnen ki moun ki revize vil la pou etid trafik ak pakin.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=6727.937s">[Mike O'Brien]</a>: Natirèlman, Mike O'Brien ak mwen te rete nan 1 Sinclair Road.
 Mwen panse mwen ka konprann entansyon sant edikasyon yo pwopoze a.
 Mwen ka menm apresye ke bilding nan pwochen pa menm vid jan li te ye nan dènye ane yo.
 Mwen ka menm apresye devlopè kap chèche yon retou sou envestisman.
 Achte bilding sa a.
 Men, mwen te panse mwen ta poze kèk kesyon.
 Oke, yon ti kras plis klè, mwen regrèt ke mwen an reta nan reyinyon sa a, mwen poko rekòmanse reyinyon an, men mwen panse devlopè yo ta ka pi klè ak transparan sou si sa a se te entansyon an tout tan, oswa
 Li te okòmansman plan A, men li pa t 'kapab fini, epi kounye a plan B se eseye jwenn kèk retounen sou envestisman an nan achte bilding nan pwochen pòt.
 Nan sans sa a, sanble se yon plan ki poko fini, omwen dapre sa mwen tande jiskaprezan nan konferans sa a.
 Se konsa, ak delè a sis mwa, mwen ta di, ki sa ki nan prese a? Mwen ta pito wè sa a, si li pral fè, byen fè pase yon vire rapid isit la.
 Mwen konnen te gen yon etid trafik men se pa yon etid enpak kominote a.
 Ou konnen, kit se valè pwopriyete, estatistik krim, kèlkeswa sa.
 Etid trafik la se gwo, men mwen plis konsène sou ki jan adisyon sa a pral afekte tout kominote a.

 Pwochen oratè sou lis la se Manm Kongrè George Scarpelli.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=6864.229s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Byenveni nan Kongrè a Scarpelli.
 Di non ou epi devine pou dosye a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=6868.593s">[George Scarpelli]</a>: Mèsi, George Scarpelli 27 Butler Street, non sèlman nan men konsèy la men nan men vwazen yo.
 Mwen te resevwa anpil, anpil apèl nan men rezidan yo repete ke kòz sa a se nòb e mwen pa kwè pèsonn ka demanti sa.
 Olye de sa, se te yon apèl ki te fèt deja nan espwa ke li ta gen yon enpak pozitif sou kalite lavi moun ki te frekante pwopriyete a.
 Mwen panse ke kalite lavi pou rezidan nou yo se menm pi enpòtan kounye a paske ankò mwen panse
 Te gen yon mank de kominikasyon ki soti bò kote Butter a epi pa gen okenn konpreyansyon sou sa ki te pase.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke vitès la reyèlman vire moun koupe apre eleksyon an.
 Mwen panse ke pi gwo kesyon rezidan yo mwen pataje avè m ap poze.
 Yon etid transpò se pa reyèlman yon etid transpò konplè.
 Mwen panse se kote vil la dwe patisipe, nou dwe mande enjenyè trafik nou yo pou yo aplike yon plan ki pa soti nan moun k ap eseye devlope zòn nan, men ki soti nan rezidan nou yo.
 Mwen panse ke sa a enpòtan.
 Mon krwar i osi enportan ki nou konpran sa ki’n ganny esey ganny entrodwir isi dan lepase e akoz ki i’n ganny rezet dan lepase, akoz mon krwar parking i en problenm dan lepase.
 Ankò, mwen pèdi lyen an, donk mwen yon ti kras an reta si yon moun mansyone sa, men nou menm tou ap diskite sou sa achidyosèz la ta fè ak rektora a, restoran, jimnastik la, si sa ta ta vann nan yon lòt konpayi.
 Kidonk, mwen pa panse ke plan an te byen verifye pa rezidan yo epi yo pa konprann enplikasyon yo.
 Kounye a, mwen admèt, jan mwen te di, se yon kòz nòb, men mwen panse ke li trè benefisye pou fanmi yo ale la lè ou ansanm.
 Pòtay ki mennen nan lari a, yon pakin kote mas ak antèman yo fèt chak semèn.
 Kidonk, mwen panse ke se yon bagay ke nou kòm yon kominote ta dwe reflechi sou, e si mwen kapab, Emily, mwen ta renmen mande tablo CD a si nou ka eseye ranvwaye sa a nan yon lòt reyinyon. An reyalite, pou la transparans, mwen panse ke sa a enpòtan pou tout rezidan yo ki pa te kapab patisipe nan sa a paske yo jis dènyèman dekouvri.
 Mwen panse ke yo dwe jis ak tout moun ki enplike nan enpak sa a pral genyen, mwen panse ke gen yon anpil nan repons, espesyalman enpak sou trafik, ou konnen, mwen tande avoka a di pi bonè, li te pale sou pa gen moun ki kondwi.
 Sa a se pa vre.
 Nou konnen sa.
 Nou konnen sa e nou bezwen pi byen konprann ki enpak la pral genyen, sitou alantou vwazen ki anlè kote a paske reyèlman pa pral gen pakin.
 Mwen vle di, nou wè sa, sitou ak kalite.
 Ankò, sa a se yon kòz nòb.
 Mwen menm, ou konnen, si li te tankou yon sant distribisyon metadòn, si li te nan bon kote, li ta yon kòz nòb.
 Men, ankò, mwen ensiste, nou reyèlman oblije analize trafik nou an pou pran desizyon aksyon ak enfòme ak Lè sa a, asire w ke lè nou pale de tout moun, ki se vwazen an, tout moun patisipe nan desizyon sa a.
 Mèsi ankò pou tout travay di ou.
 Ou se enkwayab.
 Gen anpil bagay k ap pase.
 Nou espere ke ak nouvo chanjman zòn yo, lavi a pral vin pi fasil pou tout moun.
 Mèsi tout moun ki pran tan an.</p>

 Non mwen se Emily Fishman.
 Mwen abite nan 1 Chestnut Street.
 Epitou pou dosye a, madanm mwen Ari Fishman pran CBD, men mwen pale nan pwòp pèspektiv mwen.
 Vwazen yo aparamman eksprime enkyetid lejitim.
 Mwen te yon ti kras sezi tande yon konseye pale pa twò lontan de si legliz la ta dwe yon bon vwazen pou rezidan yo nan bilding sa a.
 Mon santi ki si nou enkyet lo sa kestyon, petet nou pa pe diskit li an bonn fwa.
 Men, ou konnen, mwen te tire enfòmasyon nan karyè mwen kòm yon pwofesè ak eksperyans pèsonèl mwen ak moun k ap travay nan abri vyolans domestik.
 Lè yo mete timoun yo nan abri, èd pou elèv yo pa fè pati zòn admisyon an.
 Moun ki abite abri yo gen tandans yo dwe vwazen trè pran swen ak anpil respè nan zòn nan, e depi kondisyon yo pou viv nan yon abri yo tèlman sevè, yo evidamman bezwen yo dwe la oswa yo pa ta la.
 Pa gen moun ki vle rete nan yon abri vyolans domestik.
 Natirèlman, gen kèk detay enpòtan ki bezwen fè soti.
 Mwen enterese nan sa Waleed ak lòt moun gen pou di
 Etandone nati a nan pwomotè sa a, li sanble ke gen bezwen plis konvèsasyon premye moun ak moun ki tou pre, tou de vwazen ak moun ki yon ti kras pi lwen.
 Etandone ensètitid sou sa k ap pase nan pi laj peyizaj politik la, anpil nan nou, espesyalman jodi a ak apre yè, gen enkyetid sou fason pou youn pran swen lòt nan yon nivo lokal olye ke
 Apwòch nou an se kontinye ankouraje fason pou sèvi ak pran swen kominote nou yo nan lòt kominote yo.
 Nou vle bati yon kominote ki bay resous pou rezidan vilnerab yo.
 Wi, nou ka di nou vle abri a, men nou bezwen tande plis solisyon kreyatif pou pakin ak sekirite pyeton.
 Men, mwen pa renmen ton ke nou la pou sèvi moun toutotan yo se yon lòt kote.</p>

 Mwen rete nan 54 Logan Avenue nan Medford.
 Mwen nan St.
 Francis Street, kidonk kounye a mwen gen fanmi toujou la.
 Kesyon mwen an se: mwen aktyèlman gen de kesyon.
 Se konsa, dapre lwa Dover isit la,
 Mwen konnen kèk moun te mansyone sa a pou timoun yo ki pral nan bilding nan, men yo pral homeschooled anba Dover Act oswa yo pral entegre nan sistèm lekòl nou an?
 Mwen konnen nou akable, jan anpil moun te di, kidonk si nou nan Dover, poukisa yo pa fè homeschooling la?
 Lòt kesyon mwen an se sa a: mwen konnen enteryè bilding sa a an danje nèt.
 Bilding lan te gen gwo kantite amyant.
 Se konsa, ki plan renovasyon yo ak plan konstriksyon yo?
 Mwen konnen ou te di ke li pral kanpe ak fonksyone nan 6 mwa.
 Um, kidonk mwen panse, ou konnen, li enpòtan pou konnen enfòmasyon sa a tou paske li fè sa.
 Hey, amyant.
 Um, mwen vle tou mansyone, ou konnen, mwen dakò ak Scarpelli, um, jan li te mansyone, ou konnen, sa a se yon kòz nòb e mwen dakò, ou konnen, gen anpil lòt kote nan Medford ki ta pi byen adapte.
 Ebyen, tout moun k ap sipòte sa a pa abite tou pre.
 Oke, yo tout lòt bò vil la.
 Kidonk, mwen panse, ou konnen, mwen jis repete ke pakin se deja yon dezas.
 Pakin la se trè difisil.
 Mwen gen de timoun piti epi ale kay papa m deja se yon gwo tèt fè mal.
 Mwen pa panse ajoute plis moun nan kominote sa a ki deja gen anpil moun se bon kote pou kòz nòb sa a.
 Mèsi.</p>

 Èske nou gen lòt manm piblik ki ta renmen fè kòmantè anvan yo mande Konseye Scarpelli pou l fè kòmantè ankò nan kapasite li kòm Depute?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7391.31s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Madanm Speaker, mon vreman annan en kopi sa ki en rezidan i dir mwan i pa kapab dir byen fò lokalman, me i otorizasyon mon pou lir li e donn son non ek son adrès pou dosye.

 Li te di: M ap viv nan Medford epi mwen sipòte fòtman abri vyolans domestik nan kominote nou an.
 Lè m t ap grandi nan Georgia, manman m te sèvi kòm volontè nan yon sant kriz kadejak, e mwen te renmen vizite yon espas ki te bay swen dirèk ak sèvis pou moun ki te sibi vyolans seksyèl ak vyolans ki baze sou sèks.

 Dènye 24 èdtan yo te trè difisil.
 Se konsa, mwen jis te vle asire w ke mwen klarifye kèk nan bagay sa yo ke yon nèg mansyone, si mwen te di kèk
 Mwen vle di, mwen panse moun k ap rele a te di mwen te di legliz la pa ta yon bon vwazen.
 Mwen jis te vle asire w ke mwen pa janm di mwen pa ta janm di mwen te panse sou legliz.
 Mwen te yon fwa yon nèg St Louis.
 Francisco te yon konstan pandan tout lavi mwen.
 Yo toleran nenpòt moun ak tout moun.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke yo ta dwe bon vwazen nenpòt moun.
 Ankò, mwen jis vle klarifye sa a.
 Mwen pa fè sa

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7673.223s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Briyan.
 Mèsi, Daniela.
 Nan moman sa a, nou pral mete fen nan peryòd kòmantè piblik pou reyinyon sa a.
 Mwen vle bay aplikan an yon repons oswa yon opòtinite pou reponn kèk nan kòmantè yo te fè, paske mwen konnen te gen yon kantite kòmantè gwo.
 Nou ta renmen tande kèk panse nan repons.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7703.687s">[Mike Ross]</a>: 好的，我会尽力的。
 首先，这个团队并不是之前来这座城市提出豪华公寓的团队。
 所以我不知道那个团队是否改变了主意并说，好吧，在这种情况下，让我们做一个清醒的房子或者让我们做
 避难所或他们去的任何地方，那不是你面前的人。
 这是一位前任索赔人，他将房产卖给了我的客户。
 我的客户即将到来，这是他们的第一个提案，因此任何针对他们的敌意，过去几分钟内对他们提出的一些评论，最重要的是，不幸且不准确。
 其次，我想就有关法律问题进行辩论。
 此次电话会议的参与者。
 但我认为这不是合适的论坛。
 我要给你们读一段引言，它可能会对我喜欢的一个案例中的人们有所帮助，而且我刚刚得到了这个案例。
 毫无疑问，教导人们如何处理日常问题并在社会中生存的基本知识
 一个教育过程。
 这就是为什么清醒的住宅在这里是合法用途的原因。
 看，我住在一个社区里。
 很久以前，我是一名议员。
 我们都生活在社区中。
 我们理解人们对周围环境的担忧。
 我们明白这一点。
 因此，这群人刻意去挨家挨户交谈。
 我很欣赏玛吉所说的。
 玛吉说她想更好地了解她的邻居。
 她希望这群人能够更好地了解他。
 这个小组同意。
 该小组希望更好地了解这个社区。
 我认为人们会发现英语中最危险的词是they。
 他们。
 当人们会发现什么
 她深入探讨了家庭暴力的话题，同时也分享了自己的经历，我们很感激就是这样。
 与此相关的人以及家人和朋友，他们将居住在该房产中。
 任何地方都没有这样的房产，因为人们不希望在他们的后院有一个无家可归者收容所。
 在这次会议之前，有人在不同的房屋上投下传单，并说请出现，以防止无家可归者收容所来到您的社区。
 现在我明白了，人们看到这个，他们很生气，他们认为有人试图对他们施加一些影响并破坏他们的社区。
 我的客户敲门、与邻居交谈并询问他们是否愿意，而不是因为我们需要停车位。
 因为人们认为我们需要停车位。
 你听说过最近成立了这家公司与我们合作的专业人士，这就是为什么这个实体在国务卿办公室里很新鲜，而不是因为我们制定了一些精心设计的计划来以某种方式欺骗这个电话的参与者
 以某种方式让新人进入这个空间，试图告诉他们，我们想假装我们想要建立一个家庭暴力庇护所，这样我们就可以转身并以某种方式穿过我们实际上正在尝试建造的梅德福市，什么，一个无家可归者收容所或建造豪华住房，但我们假装进来
 所以不，这里的情况并非如此。
 它拥有经验丰富的专业人士，他们从事这项工作数十年，从事这项工作数十年。
 Taisha 在这里为这个项目创建了一个实体 Halo House，作为服务这个社区的非营利实体。
 业主安德鲁·利奇菲尔德和史蒂夫·苏达
 其他类型此类住房的业主，以开发商的身份，自己拥有该房产，因此不会有与之相关的免税，即使租赁该空间的租户是非营利组织。
 这里的目标是
 改善这些人的生活，他们在许多情况下是生活在同一社区的人。
 让我尝试回答一些具体问题。
 我提到了财产税，它们将被支付。
 有人说我们隐藏了房间数量，原来是 40 间，现在是 37 间。
 正如我所说，共有 37 个房间和 3 个灵活房间，总共 40 个房间。
 这三个灵活的房间可以用作办公室。
 它们可以用作临时设施。
 它们可以用作灵活的安装空间。
 所以一共有40个房间。
 那个房间里会有多少人？
 好吧，如果你有一个母亲和一个婴儿，那就是两个人在同一个房间里。
 如果你有一个母亲，还有一个儿子，就像我之前说过的，如果那个儿子七八岁，那么这个儿子就会住在隔壁房间，他们之间会有一扇门。
 建筑物的全部容量是我们的建筑师和您的施工部门之间解决的过程。
 您的建筑部门根据我们的建筑师向您的建筑部门提供的建筑级别文件提供了法律允许的数量。
 建筑无障碍吗？
 当然是。
 我们必须遵守无障碍指南。
 我不知道，这是一项耗资超过百万美元的翻新工程，触发了一定程度的无障碍指南。
 我们的建筑师完全理解并理解了这一点。
 您所在大楼的员工都明白这一点。
 这有不同的层次。
 这座建筑将被彻底夷为平地。
 这些洒水装置将为消防员创建某种专业分类，而该建筑中目前尚不存在这种分类。
 无论这里是否需要电梯，如果由于某种残疾人通道、某些 AAA 要求、某些无障碍要求而需要电梯，那么我们就会在那里安装电梯。
 但我们的理解，我们的建筑师埃里克·扎切森（Eric Zacherson）非常好，他在马萨诸塞州做了很多工作，包括在波士顿市，
 他认为我们这个空间不需要电梯。
 否则我们就会穿上它们。
 我们建议通过在底层创建无障碍单元并进入底层的这些区域来实现无障碍指南。
 消防路线、与火灾有关的其他问题、灭火系统、改进我们的系统。
 所有这些事情都不是我们提议的。
 这些是马萨诸塞州建筑规范和消防规范提出并由您的建筑部门强制执行的内容。
 当然，我们必须遵守所有这些规定。
 但我认为这个问题的核心是使用问题。
 当我的客户敲开一些邻居的门说：看，你们有这个空包裹吗？
 你愿意租吗？
 这是一个公平的问题。
 这次会议他们问我们，他们在这次会议上告诉我们，这都是交通问题，这都是停车和交通问题，尽管我们告诉他们，根据我们的专业经验，我们的客户没有车，也没有带车。
 但我们看到了拥有三四个空间的价值。
 如果有的话那就太好了。
 我们这个包里没有这个。
 牧师或修女的包裹里没有这个。
 是的，他们没有开车去某个地方，但他们有人来帮助他们在设施周围做事。
 拥有它就太好了。
 我们得到的答案是，如果我们同意建造豪华公寓，我们就会获得停车位。
 如果我们要建造豪华公寓，那么是的，可以达成协议来创建停车位，并将这些停车位用于该设施。
 但人们不希望他们附近有无家可归者收容所。
 这就是问题所在。
 这就是我们所听到的。
 我认为很容易说这是一个无家可归者收容所，并用它来污蔑这里提出的建议。
 这正是
 这就是为什么我们制定《多佛修正案》等法律来防止此类使用，因为使用通常会带来偏见。
 孩子们会上学还是必须上学？
 在家里要有礼貌。
 孩子们将有机会进入学校系统。
 如果孩子想要，如果父母想要在家教育他们，那些父母对吗？
 当然是。
 这个社区有公园。
 希基公园是附近的一个公园。
 这是这些孩子最有可能去的地方并受到适当的监督。
 事实上，由于该设施拥有的资源，在许多情况下，他们将受到更好的监督，而不是在住房不足或养育不足的情况下。
 他们是美国人还是非法的？
 这个国家现在的需要是为受虐待的妇女及其子女提供资源。
 我怀疑这种需求是全球性的需求。
 我会让露丝和塔夏莎完成这个问题，回答这个问题。
 没有人会被赶下公交车。
 如果市政府不希望我们在圣路易斯提供人行道
 克莱尔，我们不会在圣克莱尔街提供人行道。
 克拉拉。
 该公寓没有在圣路易斯提供人行道。
 克拉拉。
 所以我认为这种家庭暴力
 呃，资源，你知道你不想投资比你需要的更多的钱，也不应该投资，不要在圣路易斯建造人行道是可以的。
 克莱尔，如果这是城市希望我们做的，我们会遵守城市要求我们做的一切，他们希望我们做消防车道，所以那里可以有消防车道，也有一定的要求，我们并不是建议我们取消。
 防火罩或消防栓，当然我们会完全遵守所有这些要求。
 我认为这涵盖了
 尤其是异地工作。
 没有人会尝试在圣路易斯进行商业驾驶。
 克莱尔和其他小巷。
 在许多这样的工作目的地，太阳能电池板，以及其他类似的东西，这就是我们拥有渡轮的原因。
 人们将登上渡轮并被带到这些资源。
 并非所有资源都能到达我们手中。
 很多很多。
 但像这样的事情
 您将不会学习在该社区附近的街道上驾驶商用车辆。
 它们将在我们派遣人员的异地设施中完成。
 我想，Tay，你应该把这段对话放在聊天评论中。
 最后，如果可以的话，让我把它交给露丝，或者交给塔夏莎来回应，因为这是你一生的工作。
 他们告诉你，你只是认为这是一个骗局。
 我很抱歉不得不听到这个消息。
 我认为你有权得到答案。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8469.678s">[Taisha Gishard]</a>: Kidonk, Ruth, èske w vle dirije?
 Mwen definitivman konnen ki sa mwen te fè fas ak.
 epi yo te pwoteje plizyè santèn moun.
 Rezon ki fè mwen te kòmanse san bi likratif sa a se paske li soti nan kè mwen.
 Mwen te travay ak anpil moun e te oblije fè fas ak sitiyasyon tankou sa a, e li se pi bon bay yo ak abri, kontwole anviwònman an, epi fè vwazen yo konnen ke nou la a ak ke nou pran swen yo.
 Não é um truque.
 nou pa fè anyen
 Paske li se yon òganizasyon ki pa pou pwofi, li fè yon pwofi.
 Ou pa fè yon pwofi atravè san bi likratif ou a.
 Menmsi mwen se yon lokatè, mwen jwenn yon rabè.
 Kontrèman, si ou menm fè yon pwofi pa lwe pwopriyete w la.
 Tout bagay ki soti nan san bi likratif la tounen vin jwenn li.
 Mwen patenarya finansyèman ak lòt òganizasyon pou vin patwone finansye mwen ak patnè alontèm pousantaj siksè mwen.
 Se poutèt sa mwen mennen ou isit la.
 Mwen te resevwa yon apèl nan men Ruth epi mwen pral kite l 'pale sou ane eksperyans li yo, men nou pa vle fè anyen nan vil Medford.
 Ruth, mwen pral kite ou pale sou lòt bagay yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8562.628s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Wi, mèsi ak tout mèsi pou temwayaj ou.
 Mwen jis, ou konnen, mwen pran li tout nan.
 Non mwen se Ruth Rollins.
 Mwen te travay ak kominote a pou plis pase 30 ane.
 Mwen se yon sivivan tou.
 Mwen te yon defansè vyolans domestik pou 25 ane epi mwen te gen opòtinite pou jere yon abri vyolans domestik ak sipèvize sèvis yo.
 Mwen reyèlman jis vle kenbe espas
 Mèsi a moun ki te gen kouraj pou yo pale nan apèl sa a sou fason yo te afekte yo pa vyolans domestik.
 Mwen priye pou pèsonn nan apèl sa a oswa nenpòt nan manm fanmi yo pa fè eksperyans vyolans domestik.
 Men, mwen reyèlman vle pale sou demann.
 Trannsenk pousan fanm ak timoun nan Massachusetts fè vyolans domestik pandan lavi yo.
 Mwen konprann enkyetid yo trè, trè enpòtan, pa vre?
 Men sa mwen tande a se, ou konnen, mwen pral fè yon ti bak.
 Vyolans domestik triple nan de ane ki sot pase yo, kantite sèvis yo triple e kantite moun ki afekte pa vyolans domestik triple.
 Gen abri, men malerezman, jodi a mwen pa vle se moun k ap kouri pou vyolans domestik nan Massachusetts.
 Akoz sitiyasyon imigrasyon, akoz abi sou fanm, akoz abi sou gason, akoz abi LGBTQ, ou konnen,
 E i annan bokou shelter ki kapab siport sa fanmiy, pa menm lotel kot dimoun i kapab ale.
 Se konsa demann lan la.
 Pou mwen, gen anpil konvèsasyon, e mwen di sa ak tout respè, pa nan lakou mwen, pa nan lakou mwen.
 Men nou ka moun, nou pa janm konnen ki lè vyolans domestik ka frape pòt nou e nou vle bay fanmi nou menm sipò nou bezwen an.
 Se konsa, mwen jis te vle pataje sa a.
 Sekirite se toujou, toujou, toujou faktè ki pi enpòtan lè w ap fè fas ak vyolans domestik.
 Èske li te ekri sou wòch?
 Èske li deja pafè?
 Non.
 Se toujou sekirite moun k ap sove yon relasyon abizif ansanm ak sekirite rezidan yo.
 Donk, yo gen yon plan konplè epi nou pral travay ak lapolis Medford, travay ak lòt moun ki ka sipòte plan sa a pou nou ka gen siksè.
 Kòlèg mwen yo te gen anpil bagay diferan yo di sou sèvis.
 ou konnen,
 Premye pwen kontak nou pou sèvis ak sipò se sipòte ak edike sivivan sa yo k ap sove nan relasyon abizif grasa swen ki enfòme sou chòk yo.
 Sa vle di, sa a se premye pwen kontak ou.
 Se konsa, li ta ka edikasyon.
 Ta ka gen yon traktè nan do a.
 Petèt moun ki estasyone nan pakin nan?
 Non.
 Travay nou se bay yo pouvwa pou yo ka ase estab pou kraze sik vyolans pou tèt yo ak pitit yo.
 Yo te di anpil e mwen te eseye kouvri tout bagay, men osi lwen ke pwosedi ale, sa depann de bezwen an.
 Li pa jis e lè nou pale de imigrasyon wi, se move.
 Vyolans domestik pa gen lonbraj.
 Mwen jis vle di sa a e sa baze sou ane eksperyans mwen.
 Pa gen lonbraj.
 Pa gen okenn ras.
 Objektif nou se sipòte fanmi yo pou yo ka kraze sik vyolans kont timoun yo.
 Pafè?
 Non, men bezwen an la.
 M ap mande w pou w gade sa a anrapò ak sèvis pou sivivan vyolans domestik.
 Moun yo ap viv nan machin yo, moun yo pa gen okenn kote yo ale, moun yo ap viv nan chanm ijans.
 Se konsa, definitivman gen yon bezwen.
 Èske gen yon bagay ki bezwen repare?
 vrèman.
 Èske sa se yon bon opòtinite pou sèvi fanm ak timoun?
 Kidonk, si nou vrèman enkyete sou vyolans domestik oswa abri pou fanm yo,
 Sa a se yon plasman tanporè.
 Objektif la se estabilize ak otorize yo pou yo ka gen lojman alontèm.
 Se la tout pwogramasyon, tout sèvis ap antre nan jwèt.
 Se konsa, mwen panse ke gen anpil enkyetid.
 Men, nan ka mwen an, sa mwen reyèlman vle fè se pale sou bezwen.
 Mwen pa konnen sou pakin.
 Li sanble se yon gwo pwoblèm.
 Men, mwen konnen bezwen an egziste.
 Sa a se sa mwen reyèlman vle pale sou, sekirite ak aspè pwogramasyon yo.
 Se konsa, mwen vle di, se tout sa mwen genyen.
 Men, mwen jis konnen ke mwen te fè sa pou yon tan long.
 Mwen rayi di li, men mwen di li ak tout respè.
 Nou nan Boston, ak anpil moun Method vin Boston pou sèvis.
 Kidonk li t ap yon wont pou nou si nou pa t sipòte lòt moun.
 Sa a trè presye pou mwen.
 Se poutèt sa mwen di sa ak respè.
 Mwen di sa ak konpasyon, e mwen priye pou pèsonn ki nan apèl sa a pa sibi vyolans domestik e pa gen okenn kote pou ale.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8886.446s">[Mike Ross]</a>: Bon, madam Prezidan, mwen pral pran poz isit la.
 Mwen panse ke nou te ba ou pi bon an.
 Yon moun mansyone yon pòt.
 Pa gen okenn pòtay ki mennen nan pwopriyete nenpòt moun.
 Sa p ap rive.
 Asbès, nenpòt bagay konsa, si genyen, dwe être professionnelle traité.
 Andrew Litchfield, Steve Suida, se sa yo te fè.
 Yo nan endistri imobilye a.
 Yo te fè fas ak bilding ki domaje.
 Sa a se sa yo fè.
 Gen yon pwosesis pou fè fas ak pwoblèm sa a.
 Epi li pral trete kòmsadwa avèk Medford Building Department ak ajans sante piblik ki apwopriye yo ak tout lòt bagay.
 Madam Prezidan, kite m fè yon poz isit la.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8925.414s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mèsi Michael, Ruth ak Tasha.
 Mwen apresye repons ou a.
 Mwen pral remèt li bay Direktè Hunter.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8934.942s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Mersi madam Chairman.
 Aktyèlman, mwen jis te vle pataje kèk enfòmasyon adisyonèl ak tablo a.
 Moun pa wè li kòm yon pati nan reflechi a.
 Mwen vrèman vle pataje sa ak piblik la.
 Youn nan enkyetid mwen espere tande se sou lekòl, transpò ak pri.
 Se konsa, mwen kontakte Direktè Enskripsyon ak Shipping nou an.
 Li tou jere tout transpòtasyon moun ki san kay nan sistèm lekòl la.
 Li te di Medford dezespereman bezwen abri.
 Li konnen gen fanmi nan Medford ki fè kanape navige, men yo pa fè li nan sitiyasyon ki gen anpil moun.
 Si timoun nan pa an danje, yo pa gen okenn obligasyon legal pou rapòte.
 Men, gen kèk moun ki benefisye anpil lè yo gen plis espas epi yo pa oblije gen de oswa twa fanmi k ap viv ansanm konsa.
 Se konsa, mwen te mande l 'ki jan sa a ta afekte lekòl la.
 Li te di si gen timoun ki gen laj lekòl ki san kay, fason sa ap travay se paran yo ki deside
 Si yo vle pitit yo ale nan lekòl la, sistèm lekòl la nan kominote kote yo ap viv kounye a oswa kote yo deplase.
 Si moun nan ap viv nan Everett epi li deplase, paran an ka mande plasman nan Medford oswa Everett.
 Kidonk, si te gen transpò, si yo te fini vin Medford, mwen ta dwe yon elèv regilye tankou tout lòt moun ki gen transpò regilye.
 Si se paske yo bezwen yo dwe transpòte tounen yon kote
 Fason li fonksyone jodi a se ke de kominote yo pataje pri transpò elèv sa yo (anjeneral pa kamyon), ak eta a ranbouse 80 pousan nan pri a.
 Padon, li ban m 'yon legal, Wind oswa yon bagay tankou sa, men fondamantalman yo ranbouse nou 80% nan depans sa yo anbake.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9048.231s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: Mwen jis mete sa a nan yon mesaj tèks.</p>

 McKinney-Vento Lwa Asistans pou Sanzabri.
 Mwen panse ke rezidan yo ta dwe gen enfòmasyon sa yo, byenke li pa fè pati sa ki konsèy la ap konsidere aswè a paske mwen panse ke gen anpil enkonpreyansyon oswa move enfòmasyon sou li.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9068.274s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mèsi Alicia.
 Mwen panse ke kòm yon tablo nou gen anpil nan reflechi sou.
 Oke, mwen panse Halo House ta ka yon bon vwazen.
 Mwen kwè tout manm piblik k ap patisipe nan apèl sa a vle vin bon vwazen tou.
 Men, dapre sa mwen konprann, gen yon anpil nan varyab.
 Sa kestyon i bezwen ganny adrese, anplis serten sansibilizasyon kominoter, ou konnen, anplis demann parking, ki paret enn bann aktivite prensipal.
 Mwen ta prefere kontinye diskisyon sa a pou pèmèt plis tan, men mwen ta renmen tou kite li ouvè pou konsiderasyon Konsèy la.
 De kesyon n ap konsidere se: Èske sa a kalifye kòm yon itilizasyon edikasyon ki pwoteje pa Amannman Dover?
 Lè sa a, ki dispozisyon rezonab ki ta dwe aplike nan pwojè a?
 Èske yo ta dwe akòde egzanpsyon yo mande pou egzijans pakin ak lòt estanda gwosè?
 Ki kondisyon apwobasyon ki nesesè pou diminye nenpòt efè negatif nan egzanpsyon yo mande a?
 Avèk sa, mwen pral louvri li jiska tablo a.
 pou deba ak deliberasyon.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9162.218s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: Mwen panse byen fò, ki ka danjere, men
 Mwen panse ke nou te fè li.
 Mwen dakò ak anpil nan sa Emily jis rezime.
 Mwen panse ke gen yon bon ka yo dwe fè ke sa a ta bon pou kominote nou an.
 Mwen tou tande byen fò ak klè ke te gen enkyetid enpòtan sou detay aplikasyon an.
 Mwen panse
 Se wòl yon konsèy konsa: kreye opòtinite ak ankouraje kolaborasyon pou kandida yo ak kominote yo pou yo fè bagay ki benefisye tout moun.
 Se konsa, li te fè sans pou mwen kenbe koneksyon sa a pral regle kèk nan detay sa yo.
 Mwen gen li tou limen men mwen pa ka li paske mwen ap koute sa a.
 Nan kad diskisyon sa a,
 Se tankou m ap eseye fè pwòp ankèt mwen sou Amannman Dover.
 Mwen pa yon avoka, men mwen se yon bibliyotekè rechèch.
 Sa nou te aprann jiskaprezan sanble egzat, men mwen panse youn nan benefis ki genyen nan yon fen se ke nou ka konfime sa a ak rechèch adisyonèl.
 Non, mwen panse ke sa, mwen pa vle abandone sou pwojè a, men gen nan evidamman anpil diskisyon sou fason pou fè li mache.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9255.971s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: Mèsi, Ali.
 Mwen totalman dakò ak Ali.
 Mwen panse ke sa a se yon pwojè trè enpòtan pou pa kontinye pou nou ka diskite sou kèk aspè nan pwojè a pi pwofondè.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9276.203s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Adan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9277.624s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: Wi, mwen devine mwen ta renmen ranfòse lide sa yo tou, petèt nan risk pou yo pale byen fò.
 Mwen panse ke se pwen Michael Ross la.
 Ou konnen, objektif yon amannman tankou Amannman Dover se paske, ou konnen, bagay sa yo fè pati kominote a e anpil fwa gen rezistans.
 Men, mwen panse tou enkyetid kominote a lejitim.
 Apre yon tan, apwòch sa a pral kreye yon pi bon sans konfyans ant yo.
 Menm san nou pa yon avoka, mwen panse ke dapre jurisprudence anvan an, nou ta dwe fè dilijans nou pou asire ke sa a tonbe nan jiridiksyon Dover.
 Soti nan pwòp rechèch mwen an sou sa a ak jis gade nan edikasyon sot pase yo ak ka azil, li sanble tankou sa a ta ka tonbe nan sijè ki abòde lan Amannman Dover.
 Men, si bagay yo pa t 'fè, yon sequel ta gen sans, sitou, jan moun di, e mwen panse ke anpil moun pral fache apre dènye jou a.
 Nou pa vle pran desizyon lè nou fatige.
 Nan ki atitid nou ye.
 Apre sa, mwen panse ke lòt pati a se kontak ak konfyans nan kominote a, ki mwen te fè eksperyans nan diferan vil ki tou pre pwojè oswa enstalasyon tankou sa a.
 Mwen pa janm gen anyen lòt pase yon eksperyans trè pozitif ak yo.
 Mwen panse ke yo jwe yon wòl trè valab.
 Mon panse, parey bann dimoun isi, mon dir, sa bann manm nou kominote ki’n pas atraver bann moman ki dan bezwen regilyerman.
 Ou konnen, dènye bagay, ou konnen, mwen pèsonèlman pa panse, kòm yon manm konsèy vil, mwen pare kounye a reyèlman pale sou tout pwoblèm yo taktik alantou pakin ak kalite evalyasyon enpak ak eksepsyon aktyèl.
 Ki jan sa fèt la.
 Mwen panse ke sa ki ta itil ta dwe egzanp plis konkrè nan pwojè menm jan an, ou konnen, yon ti kras pi espesifik, tankou pwen done sou konbyen trafik ou ka atann.
 Yon fwa ankò, nan efò a, mwen te panse de konfyans mityèl.</p>

 Mwen regrèt nou pa ka fè aswè a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9639.797s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Se konsa, petèt nou ka rezime enfòmasyon nou vle kontinye pou moun ki fè demann lan ka konprann sijè ki abòde lan.
 Lè sa a, nou ka diskite sou dat.
 Donk mwen panse ke nou toujou nan deliberasyon palmantè yo.
 Danielle, èske nou ta dwe louvri yon dokiman Word pou kòmanse ekri sijè a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9667.145s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Mwen pèdi tren mwen an nan panse.
 Mwen fatige anpil.
 Sa m ap di a se, kèlkeswa sa ki rive, si nou ap chèche yon solisyon pou twotwa, mwen ta
 Ou konnen, plan an finalize paske li difisil pou mete kondisyon sou bagay ki bezwen nan plan an paske li ouvè a entèpretasyon ak difisil pou aplike.
 Se konsa, mwen ta ajoute ke pwochen reyinyon an pral trè okipe.
 Nou fè fas ak yon revizyon plan sit tanpèt difisil ak chanjman zòn pou distri anba lavil Mystic Avenue.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9711.718s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Ki dat reyinyon sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9713.841s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: Se 20yèm kounye a, nou ka rankontre sèlman pwochen fwa.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9720.788s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Ki pwochen dat pou reyinyon an, 4 desanm?
 Tout se byen.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9728.436s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: Mwen panse ke li jwe sou 4 desanm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9731.722s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Nou mande kandida yo konfime disponiblite yo.
 Mwen panse tou li ta yon bon lide pou pran seri enfòmasyon ke nou vle nan pwochen reyinyon an pou yo konprann, ou konnen, se yon mòn?
 Èske se yon grenn sab?
 Konbyen tan yo pran?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9748.215s">[Mike Ross]</a>: Se poutèt sa, gwoup nou an kontan patisipe nan reyinyon 4 desanm nan kòm yon dat ki an sekirite.
 Ki sa nou vle fè se jwenn ansanm ak moun lè sa a epi devlope yon lis ke nou ka jenere.
 Mwen prefere travay ak ekip la epi mande konsèy la pou èd
 Kalite pwodwi travay nou kreye ki baze sou opinyon yo prezante jodi a.
 Mwen panse ke yo te fè kòmantè rezonab.
 Mwen panse ke yo te fè kèk kòmantè ki pa te lejitim tou.
 Mwen panse ke nou dwe onèt sou sa.
 Alor mon anvi asire ki sa ki nou pe demann nou pour fer i konsistan avek nou drwa konman bann aplikan spesifik.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9800.916s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Wi, nou annan en manda kler pou komite.
 Gen kèk pwojè ki nan jiridiksyon nou an e lòt pa yo.
 Se poutèt sa li pi bon pou w rete nan limit sa yo.
 Sa a se dwa w kòm yon kandida.
 Se poutèt sa, nou pral ranpli wòl sa a kòm konseye pou ou kòm yon kandida ak kòm yon sitwayen Medford.
 kòm komite planifikasyon.
 Mwen jis te gen yon kesyon.
 Èske nou ka imèl plis kesyon?
 Wi, tanpri voye nenpòt kesyon, nenpòt kòmantè.
 Nou akeyi ak ankouraje w, epi di ou mèsi pou rete sou entènèt ak prete ekspètiz ou nan pwojè sa a.
 Mèsi Alicia.
 Padon, Peter, ale pi devan.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9851.124s">[Peter Calves]</a>: Wi, se konsa mwen fè twazyèm mwen an
 Isit la yo se responsablite yo sou li.
 Mwen gen yon lis kondisyon.
 Danielle te di kèk bagay sou finalize plan pwojè yo e ke nou te vle konfime jiridiksyon St.
 Clare Street ak enpak sa ka genyen sou trafik.
 Èske gen lòt kondisyon lejislatè yo ta renmen wè pandan de jou kap vini yo?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9893.753s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Menm jan an tou, règleman nou yo ka adrese kondisyon pakin, lòt estanda gwosè, ak nenpòt kondisyon apwobasyon ki nesesè pou bese nenpòt efè negatif nan egzijans egzanpsyon.
 Sa a kaptire yon gwo pati nan li.
 Mwen ta sijere tou ke aplikan yo petèt adrese kèk bagay ki depase limit fowòm sa a, espesyalman si gen foto, kat, oswa lòt kontni ki enfòmasyon adisyonèl pral ede telespektatè yo konprann kèk nan repons ou a kesyon sa yo.
 Mwen panse ke, si sa aplikab, ta trè benefik pou pwochen relasyon vwazen.
 Mwen te resevwa yon kesyon via chat e sa te ye
 Si reyinyon 4 desanm nan se tou pou kominote a ak rezidan yo, li ka bezwen mennen l nan City Hall, oswa li ka tonbe anba pouvwa konsèy vil la.
 Reyinyon yo toujou ouvri pou kominote a ak rezidan yo, men mwen konprann ka gen yon dezi fè kòmantè plis sou zafè sa a.
 Èske se pwoblèm sa a?
 Wi, oke.
 Èske nou ka gen yon lòt peryòd kòmantè piblik?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9975.735s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Madam Prezidan, pou sijè ki patikilyèman long, gwo, oswa kontwovèsyal, anjeneral ou di ke ou ta renmen limite kòmantè piblik la nan sijè ki pa diskite nan reyinyon sa a.
 Donk si yo vini ak nouvo enfòmasyon, nouvo bagay, piblik la ka fè kòmantè, men pap gen okenn kòmantè.
 Se poutèt sa konsèy la tande menm kòmantè yo te fè aswè a. Yo ta dwe limite kòmantè a nouvo enfòmasyon. Mwen panse ke si moun santi yo pa ka pale aswè a, sa ka jere. Men, yo te vle fè eko sa k ap pase isit la. Tanpri voye yon imèl ba nou epi Komisyon Konsèy la ap fè w konnen gen plis moun ki gen menm lide yo deyò.
 Wi, men nou pa tande 10 moun ki di menm bagay la ankò ak ankò.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10032.739s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Jis pou klarifye, li te vrèman itil pou tande repons emosyonèl odyans lan aswè a.
 Se konsa, nou vrèman apresye moun ki pran kontak ak pataje kòmantè yo, konesans ak eksperyans, pandan y ap kandida yo tou pataje vizyon yo pou sit la.
 konsa wi
 Youn se, wi.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10060.842s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: Yon lòt kesyon.
 Nou gen Amannman Dover a, ki mwen panse ki gen ladann sa gouvènman an ak Peter te di.
 Mwen panse ke te gen yon kòmantè piblik e li te yon kòmantè valab.
 I bon pou annan lopinyon counsel, me mon krwar koman en manm board i pli bon pou nou regard bann legzanp dan case law oubyen bann dokiman zot menm e triangul zot endepandans pour ki nou koman en board i osi dakor avek lopinyon counsel.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10099.908s">[SPEAKER_39]</a>: Uh, sof si nou dokimante tou, mwen vle di, Madam Speaker, eskize pou m entèwonp ou soti nan sekans, men, um, uh, ou konnen nou gen yon petisyon 24 paj, um, ou konnen, mete yon pati nan li nan prèv, ki se yon lèt ke nou bay konsèy la ki te rive. Mwen definitivman rate egzamen an, dezole, men petèt mwen pral peye atansyon.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10128.928s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: Pou reyinyon 4 desanm lan, konsèy la ta dwe egzakman revize dokiman background yo.
 Mwen regrèt Michael.
 Mwen pa t 'wè egzibisyon an espesifik.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10143.399s">[Mike Ross]</a>: Genyen tou nèf paj nan Boston O'Neal Report.
 Kòm yon moun te fè kòmantè, sa a se pa sèlman yon pwoblèm minè.
 Se konsa, kantite materyèl se byen ase.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10154.608s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Mèsi.
 Mwen jis wè yon lòt kòmantè sou konbyen tan li pran pou kominote a revize materyèl.
 Nou respekte kondisyon legal yo pou reyinyon ouvè yo, kidonk mwen kwè tout avi reyinyon yo pral afiche 48 èdtan anvan reyinyon an.
 Lè sa a, nou pataje lyen an
 Kite m 'wè si mwen ka jwenn li soti.
 Link sou enfòmasyon sou aplikan yo.
 Lè sa a, mwen ka remèt li.
 Oh, mwen pa t ', paske mwen te ale epi tounen.
 Alicia, ou ka mete lyen sa tounen?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10203.573s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Wi.
 Madanm Chairman, de pwen.
 Premyèman, si Komisyon Konsèy la vle, mwen ka mande yon opinyon fòmèl ekri nan men avoka nou yo.
 Kòm nan pwoblèm nan nan ka sa a, kòm nan lefèt ke li te Dover.
 Yon lòt se ke pwopriyetè Andrew Litchfield ak Steve Suda yo vle pataje enfòmasyon kontak yo ak piblik la paske lè yo frape nan pòt la, yo di anpil moun pa reponn.
 Se konsa, mwen pral kite sa nan chat la isit la.
 Men an reyalite, si yo vle, m ap mete l nan yon ti dokiman Word ansanm ak dosye piblik la, enfòmasyon kontak pwopriyetè a, si yo vle nou fè menm bagay la pou moun ka kontakte yo.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10253.875s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Wi, mwen se yon demann divilgasyon sa a epi mwen ta renmen tande piblik la dirèkteman.
 Mwen ankouraje w pataje nenpòt kòmantè oswa devlopman ak anplwaye vil la ak konsèy la.
 Oke, gwo.
 Mèsi a Alicia pou pèmèt nou fè sa.
 Mwen te gen yon lòt kesyon.
 Èske pwochen reyinyon an se 4 desanm?
 Sa a se dat nou rekòmande pou kontinye.
 Nou dwe fè yon mosyon fòmèl.
 Li sanble ke moun k ap fè apèl la sipòte dat sa a.
 Lè l wè sa, li te fè yon ti non.
 Annie, ou gen kòmantè?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10298.307s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: Non, mon ti ava kontan pou fer sa mosyon.</p>

 Mwen pral dezyèm lan.

 Wi.
 Ben Lavelle.
 Wi.
 Mwen menm, Emily Herdman, se yon defann kontinite.
 Mwen wè plis kòmantè nan chat la.
 Mwen ankouraje piblik la soumèt kòmantè sa yo sou sitwèb TOC oswa pataje yo dirèkteman ak aplikan yo.
 Yo te fè yon òf trè jenere.
 Kidonk, mwen ankouraje piblik la swiv tou de apwòch.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10409.103s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: Sorry Emily, jis klarifye.
 Nan Google Drive ke Alicia te pataje a, mwen panse mwen te gade nan Google Drive men mwen pa t 'kapab jwenn dokiman Amannman Dover ke Michael t'ap pale a.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10431.38s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Poukisa nou pa ka trete kontni sa a?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10442.436s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Wi.
 Wi.
 Wi, li ta pi bon pou klarifye sa a.

 Ebyen nap wè kandida pou 21 St Clair le 4 desanm.

 Sa vle di anpil.
 Sa se yon bon fason pou patisipe lokalman.
 Se konsa, mèsi.

 Li te pase, wi, Peter te rele pou apwobasyon, Fishman apwouve, rès konsèy la te absan, èske mwen ta dwe chèche non yo? Non, oke, gwo, mèsi. Pwochen nan ajanda nou an se renouvèlman zòn. Èske gen kèk mizajou sou zòn nan ekip planifikasyon an ta renmen pataje avèk nou?
 Li prèske 10 è.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10553.95s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Mwen te prèske twò fatige fè li.
 Gen yon odyans piblik 20 novanm.
 Si ou ta renmen revize nenpòt nan sa yo avè m 'davans, mwen ta kontan fè sa.
 Nou prevwa tou efò pou ankouraje devlopman rapid nan Salem Street an Desanm.
 Se konsa, mwen devine pa gen okenn nan sa a se nouvèl pou ou.
 Ou pral wè ke li gen sèlman yon sèl ranje, ki ta dwe gen yon nòt vèt.
 Nou toujou ap travay sou detay yo nan nòt vèt la ak konsiltan nou yo.
 Se konsa, sa pral rive plis oswa mwens apre reyalite a, men tou, trè vit nan mwa desanm.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10594.675s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: Eske se jis Mistik Avenue, Alicia?</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10665.054s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: Men, o, se konsa mwen pa t 'kreye li.</p>
