    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=296.17s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: شكرا لك، الرئيس لوك تشومتيو.
 مرة أخرى، هذا هو دانييل إيفان، كبير المخططين.
 أريد فقط أن أقدم لك بعض المعلومات الأساسية حول الموقف الذي تواجهه.
 وكما أشار الرئيس، فإن هذا استخدام تعديلي محمي بموجب الفصل 48، الجزء 3، المعروف باسم التعديل.
 وبالتالي، فإنه يوفر الحماية لأغراض محددة.
 في هذه الحالة، قد يتم إعفاء الاستخدامات التعليمية من متطلبات محددة للوائح المحلية، مثل موقعها وكيفية إعفائها من شروط مثل الحجم وحجم المساحة ومتطلبات مواقف السيارات.
 ولذلك، فإن نطاق مراقبة التخطيط للمنشأة محدود.
 ولذلك اقتصر الاجتماع على مشاورتين.
 ولا يزال هناك السؤال الأول.
 والسؤال الذي يحتاج إلى إجابة هو هل ينطبق هذا على دفاع تعديل Doup؟
 ثانيًا، ما هي الأحكام المعقولة التي ينبغي اتخاذها فيما يتعلق بتحديد متطلبات البناء والكتلة والارتفاع ومتطلبات الحماية مع الأخذ في الاعتبار حجم الفناء ومنطقة الترفيه ومنطقة وقوف السيارات الخارجية وموقف السيارات والاستخدام المقصود؟
 تخضع أنشطة مجلس الإدارة المسموح بها للموافقة المشروطة أو التنازل، ولكن قد يتم رفضها بدون المعلومات المطلوبة.
 لذلك أردت فقط إعداد الطاولة وإعلام الجميع كيف ستبدو مراجعة اليوم وقوة الطاولة.
 أوركون</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=382.415s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: وهذا أمر مدهش ويساعد حقًا في تحديد التوقعات عند المناقشة مع مجلس الإدارة وحضور جلسات الاستماع العامة.
 يمكننا أيضًا توجيه مثل هذه المواضيع بشكل غير مباشر من خلال هذه المناقشة.
 أدعو المرشحين للتقديم.
 هل لدينا أي مرشحين للعضوية الليلة؟

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=474.263s">[Mike Ross]</a>:  I can see your screen.
 OK.
 All right.
 Well, my name is Mike Ross.
 I'm an attorney with the law firm of Prince Lobel, and I'm representing the applicant tonight.
 Thank you for having me here, Madam Chair, members of the board, and for your comments thus far.
 And also for Daniel Evans for setting the table, really
 really well, just there.
 We are here on a site plan review, as Danielle mentioned, for 21 St.
 Clair Road, and this is a photo of it.
 What we're proposing tonight is a women's and children's shelter.
 And we have members of our team who are prepared to speak about that as well.
 But what I'm going to do is going to provide a high-level overview and then see if there are any questions.
 So this is our team, essentially.
 So Andrew Litchfield and Stephen Sveta comprise Assisi Holdings.
 These are two real estate
 professionals who have a variety of portfolio of properties and within them properties that deal specifically with social services like the one we're proposing tonight, as well as other properties as well, market rate and the like.
 They had previously worked with one of our providers, and that's Taisha Gushard.
 And Taisha has worked with a number of non-profits within the state dealing with shelter care, but also specifically with what we're proposing here, domestic violent care, particularly for women and typically young children.
 Taisha has worked with
 and her entity is called Pathway Alliance.
 She has worked with an organization called Justice for Housing.
 Justice for Housing is here tonight, led by Leslie Creedle.
 And Leslie brought one of her colleagues, Ruth Rollins, who does direct care, has been doing it for decades, I believe 30 years.
 So we have a real deep bench here to talk about the type of work we're doing, if that's what the board wants to hear about.
 Not here tonight, but provided in the materials that we've submitted to the board.
 is our engineer, Fasin O'Neill, who did a traffic review of the site.
 Our architect, Eric Zacherson, who provided the plans I'll share with you.
 Landscape architect, MDLA.
 And then there's myself and Maggie from Prince Lopel.
 And what we're proposing is the use I mentioned, we're calling it Halo House.
 And as mentioned by Danielle,
 The entitlement, the approval that we're seeking, site plan review is through the Dover Amendment that I'll walk through in a second.
 This is the site here at 21 St.
 Clair Road.
 It's next to, perhaps you'll recall, a somewhat newish condo development across from the parish center.
 It's sitting on a 5,396 square foot parcel.
 with an existing gross square floor area of just under 13,000.
 Previously used as a convent and also listed as a boarding house.
 Previously, it was a religious use and I would suspect it also came under some form of Dover amendment.
 But it's interesting, I looked at the property and the land itself was already subdivided and predates the zoning code, which in Medford is fairly early, 1925.
 Yes.
 And this site is 1924.
 The building itself was improved on the property in
 1956.
 And I just thought this was interesting.
 The name of the road used to be called Love Lane.
 I just saw that when I was grabbing the documents.
 This is the existing structure.
 As you can see, it sits really tight on the property line.
 There's not a lot of space.
 And one of the reasons why I went to the history of the site is that this is not a case where we're showing up and finding just an empty parcel of land and we could build anything there.
 What we're dealing with is an existing condition that we're inheriting that has been in place
 as a building since 1956, as a parcel since 1925 or 1924.
 So we're taking an already subdivided, non-conforming structure, parcel, and trying to make a
 a use of the parcel, but also very closely following in what was previously there, at least in use, in terms of the impact and what have you.
 So I also want to just point out that even though there is almost no land to work with around this parcel and in this building, what is there is not really
 I don't know, utilized to the fullest and to the best.
 I mean, you can see the side of the building there.
 It's kind of an area for trash toters to be stored.
 The front doesn't have any kind of plantings.
 As you can see, you don't see bushes or trees or anything around the site.
 So there are things you could do, but it's just a very tight site.
 And this is the front of it.
 There's also no
 Sidewalk on this parcel, which we're proposing to add in front of our building.
 As you can see here again, this is the front of the building.
 And, you know, whether.
 it goes to the sidewalk, when it goes to this road, formerly Love Road, now St.
 Clair, we received a report from the Public Works Department saying that this is a private road, and it may be, but everything we've seen says that this is a public road.
 Medford's own street book lists it as a public road, and we did some other looking in the Registry of Deeds, and it was referenced as a public
 roadway by by recently developed projects.
 So, I mean, I didn't do the full title examination, we could, but it seems to me that is a public road, and would invite a sidewalk and and and parking in front.
 This is the site plan, again, you can see how tight it is on that parcel really built out to the edge.
 And yeah.
 So I'm going to show you these plans really quickly.
 This is the existing plans.
 The existing setup is a 27, 29 room, depending on how you count the rooms.
 former convent with these rear rooms, as you can see here, this community, this cafeteria on the first floor, this chapel on the second floor, this community room on the third floor.
 Okay, and that's the fourth floor.
 Um, as being kind of open spaces, and then you see this large, uh.
 Classroom on the 2nd floor here, this is the existing conditions.
 Okay.
 And what we're going to be proposing, I'll show you in a moment here.
 These are the existing elevations and again, I'm going to show you what we're proposing here in a moment.
 All right, here's what we're proposing.
 So we took those back rooms, that classroom, and that chapel, and that other larger spaces, and are able to put rooms in those spaces.
 And then that classroom along the second floor, we're able to divide that.
 and create 37 rooms for this facility now.
 And as you can see, these rooms have adjoining doors.
 And the reason why they have adjoining doors is because many of our clients who will come to this facility may have young children.
 You know typical age and we can talk more about this are toddlers but they might go all the way up into the to the young teens or teenagers but typically you'll see younger children with their mother.
 And in such a case where you might have, say, you know, a brother and sister or two brothers or something, there might be what would be appropriate would be to have an adjoining room next to the mother's room.
 And that's what we can do with these configurations.
 There's a lot of flexibility for that with these various rooms.
 There's also a tremendous investment in this building.
 This building needs to be fully upgraded with all new systems, all new mechanicals, all new safety devices, and it needs new HVAC systems, new floorings, new
 a lot of renovation on the inside.
 We're predicting that the renovation costs will be 800 to a million dollars on the interior of this building, as well as some minor work to do on the exterior.
 There is no change to the envelope of this building.
 The building is staying exactly the same.
 On the fourth floor,
 Yes let me make one other point this first floor is really where all the education and classrooms and discussions and job training and.
 even areas for children to play, will be used.
 Lots of flex space, a lot of ability to use that first floor in that regard.
 And then each floor has a corner room, which is a flex room in its own self that can be used as an office or as a
 Kind of alternative room, but it could also be used as a room if it's needed.
 And that's on the floors.
 Uh, 2, 3 and 4 room 14 room 27 and room 40. so those are 3 additional rooms.
 Um.
 So, we can talk more about the activities that occur there and then on the exterior of this.
 building, what are we going to do?
 We're going to remove the cross and the birds.
 We will replace, we will, you know, point and repair the bricks, repair the windows, replace some if needed.
 We'll be adding a signage to the front door that says Halo House.
 you'll see there that there is a lift to be proposed on the front entry and really that's the only substantially noticeable change to the front and to the really to all the elevations of the building except for this is that right side of the building and then on the left side of the building what we'd like to do here based on some of the comments we've received from staff
 Is to create a path of accessible travel here.
 So we have a redundant travel.
 We have a lift in the front, but we also have a ramp along the side of the building at construction level drawings.
 We will.
 have to do a little bit of work on this ramp.
 Ramps require a railing and they require a flat period for just a certain section of the ramp.
 Our architect will do that, but this was something that we at this level are just describing as a ramp.
 And we'll have to flush it out a little bit more when we get to construction level drawings.
 Okay, and then landscaping, I mentioned that there's very sparse, not a lot of plantings or anything happening on the site here.
 We're proposing, I believe, over approximately 50 plantings, trees, bushes, and the like along the front of the building, along the sides of the building, and then creating spaces and areas for people to gather.
 So that space on the right side where you saw the toters earlier and the garbage barrels.
 those would be replaced with an exterior area for guests, for clients to gather, to recreate, to sit, to have a cup of coffee, to do whatever.
 And then in the back, the same type of area there.
 Now, one thing we don't have here and we're talking about, and it's something that came from our caregiving team, is to create some sort of play space.
 What we think we're gonna do is that area that you see is eight and nine there, that that would be turned into some play area for our kids.
 It's just basic kind of playground type equipment, nothing too sophisticated.
 There's not a lot of space there, but we might incorporate that section five into it as well.
 That's a little bit of a change that we're proposing here based on some of the conversations we've had recently as we prepared to be ready for this hearing and having conversations with our team.
 And this is just some more detail that we'll be fencing that are mentioned on our site plan and are in the plans.
 And these are the types of bushes and trees and foliage and the like that we'll be planting.
 So just, you know, in terms of the Dover Amendment, which is the name given to 40A section three, Daniel already mentioned it.
 There's just two qualifications here.
 One is the use, an accepted use under the Dover, under 40A3.
 And we submit that we are, we are a providing educational services.
 I can, I provided the, and then are we,
 Are we, what are the reasonable regulations concerning the structures themselves?
 And that section two, I said to you earlier, given the site, given the history of the site and given the plan, we are doing everything we can to make best use of it.
 We are not changing the size, the envelope of the site, if you will.
 And we are working as best we can to utilize the entire site.
 uh, within the confines of this pre-existing non-conformance structure and use.
 I provided a, uh, a more detailed, um, application with some, um, more detail on both of these points, uh, uh, prior to today's hearing.
 Um, but you know, um,
 And I'm just kind of pulling from the language of 40A Section 3 of this nonprofit use that would be educating as an education component.
 And I go a little bit deeper.
 To point out that, in fact, a use is essentially what we're providing a domestic violent shelter for women and children that's intended on providing life skills, job skills, some of just the very basic skills that people need to function and stand on their own is really the very essence of what an appropriate and acceptable use would be under the Dover Amendment.
 I want to tell you a little bit about the Pathway Alliance group, Taisha's group, and they are all available for questions.
 I imagine you'll have some for them.
 It's a really interesting group that I've gotten to know and meet through this process.
 They're dealing with
 So they have some very strict guidelines of their own.
 They see clients that are typically between six months and a year, and they do have a year as being the maximum time that they want to have any one resident staying in their facility.
 And one of the things that I learned from Leslie, who's going to be working with this group, is that they've had tremendous success with
 not seeing recidivism in their space.
 I think she has a 99% success rate, meaning that 99%, at least in the case of Leslie's efforts, clients have gone on to stable housing and not relapsed, which I think is a
 This is the work they do with their clients.
 They spend a lot of time getting their clients to stand on their own two feet so they can go out and apply for and have permanent housing.
 And this is the work that they do with their clients on a regular basis.
 So here with us today is Taisha from the
 I guess the from the pathway entity and working now with Leslie from justice for housing and then Ruth Rollins has brought in was brought in by Leslie Ruth has her own entity that she works with called we are better together.
 But Ruth also does direct service and has been in the.
 Has been in this, as I mentioned, for at least 30 years.
 1 of the groups that we're going to be working with is a group called RG reliable riders transportation company.
 This is a shuttle service.
 It's a van.
 The effort is to create 3 trips, or maybe more today to provide for the clients, but also provide for.
 employees the team understands that there is no parking at this facility the team will solve for that challenge they will solve for it for any of their staff who have parking needs we believe that those are maybe three or four people and they will find a area
 garage that may not be in Medford, it may be closer to transit, it may be some of the transit that they have.
 There's a lot of parking in those areas.
 And then the shadow will create predictability for these employees.
 In terms of clients, I'm told that
 No clients have cars, at least it's been the experience of all of our practitioners that clients do not come with their own cars.
 And so that solves an issue right there for us.
 So we feel confident and comfortable that the shuttle service will provide full access to and from the facility without needing to have on-site parking.
 And that being said, Andrew and Steve continue to talk to abutters and neighbors to see if there are opportunities, but so far there have not been.
 And again, we do not feel like that's necessary, but more we need to solve for some of the questions and some of the permitting questions that we've been asked during this process.
 And so we are trying to see if maybe we can even just have a couple of spaces nearby, even though we don't think it will be essential for the program.
 Go through this a little bit.
 I mean, there will be 24 hour security and there will always be a staff member on site at all times.
 Um, the facility provides on site, um, laundry services and, you know, food and meals as commercial kitchen.
 Um, and, um, and of course, sleeping, sleeping arrangements.
 Um, I'm going to skip over a couple of these items.
 Because I want to.
 available for questions if you have it.
 There's all kinds of classes, counseling, job counseling, meditation services, financial literacy classes, and the like.
 Other educational credit counseling services.
 I mentioned financial literacy coaching.
 This is what I wanted to show you.
 This is Justice for Housing.
 This is Leslie's entity right now.
 She has two
 buildings right now that she's operating.
 74 Morris Street in Dorchester and 241 Woodrow Ave in Dorchester.
 Both of these properties are right in residential neighborhoods.
 If you walk by them, you would think that they're just a regular house in Dorchester.
 They know their neighbors, they are active in their community.
 During the fall, there might be
 a pumpkin on the stair, you know, et cetera.
 These are people who are in this house all the time.
 And this was that stat that I heard from Leslie earlier.
 They have over 367 clients.
 Only 1% has needed to go back into temporary housing.
 The rest have really been able to get on their own feet.
 Tiesha has worked with all these other groups, as have the other two practitioners who are with us, Ruthie and Leslie, but Tiesha has worked with all these other groups in some capacity.
 She may be referring someone from the Pines Trident, she may be referring someone from St.
 Francis, Casa Merna, etc.
 The one thing I've heard from all the practitioners is that
 There are almost no domestic violence resources anywhere in Massachusetts.
 It's extremely hard to find any resource like this.
 There might be a scattered site here and there in someone's house separated from services.
 This is a very rare thing indeed.
 There are a number of rules associated.
 This will be a non-smoking facility.
 There's no alcohol, no drugs.
 These are very regimented facilities that are supervised and intended to help bring people into a healthy environment and get them into the right pathway.
 So now I want to shift from the use and just kind of close out here more on some of the physical attributes of the site.
 Some of the maybe even you might say shortcomings of the site, but that we're dealing with as a result and how we're dealing with those challenges as we are proposing here to you for site plan review.
 Um, so, uh, there is no parking.
 I mentioned that.
 Um, I also mentioned that most residents will not own their own vehicle.
 I believe all of the clients will not own their own vehicle.
 And in the case of those two or three staff members, I believe that we will be creating a shuttle service that will bring them to the facility.
 Um, there's ample MBTA services.
 Uh, there are always going to be an employee on site, but the total number of employees, not that many, five to six,
 And that during any one shift, there might be half of that.
 The I did want to just have this little graphic on the side that, you know, there is we do want to build a sidewalk off of our property.
 We don't have.
 We would provide those two to the city for approval.
 And we do believe this is a 61 foot frontage on the site we do believe that there would be space for at least two, maybe three, three cars on the front of the building.
 Yeah, so I do think practically speaking, pickup, drop off, you know, deliveries, those types of things, it's good to have some space to do that with.
 And that would be what that would be made available for.
 I mentioned there's ample parking and then, of course, the orange line and the shuttle will tie into these resources.
 We provided a traffic study from Fossil O'Neill engineers.
 This is, I just wanted to share with you, is that the way traffic studies work, as you've seen in your capacity as on this board, is they look at what the previous use was, they look at what the proposed use is, and they see what the difference is.
 Here, there is no difference because the previous use and the proposed use have the same impact based on what we're proposing, based on what was there.
 Uh, and that's, uh, we've provided this, this, um, memorandum from Faso O'Neill, and we're happy to, you know, uh, answer any questions about that.
 Uh, Faso O'Neill concludes that based on the foregoing assessment, it is the professional opinion of Faso O'Neill that the proposed development at 21 St.
 Clair will have negligible impacts on traffic operation within the study areas.
 Just finally, finally,
 Finally here.
 So there were a number of comments made from your various departments within Medford, by the way, it's been a pleasure to work with Medford and your various departments and your staff, and all of us for certain things and we are fully compliant to with all of these items that they've asked us to, of course, most of these things are going to have to happen once we get into the actual.
 work and the construction level documents.
 I mentioned the wheelchair ramp at the side entrance and some of the other items that I shared during the course of this presentation.
 So now might be, Madam Chair, a good time for me to pause and answer any questions along with the team as well.
 Thank you for the opportunity to be in front of you today.
 Thank you.
</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2024.899s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا على العرض الشامل.
 وأنا أقدر التفاصيل.
 لذا، لكي أعطي الجميع فكرة عما يبدو عليه هذا الأمر، سأفتح منتدانا للأسئلة والتعليقات.
 ثم تأتي فترة الرأي العام.
 وستتبع مراجعة مجلس الإدارة فترة التعليق العام.
 وأريد أن أطرح أي أسئلة أو تعليقات في المنتدى.
 يا أعضاء المجلس، ارفعوا أيديكم أو اصمتوا.
 آدم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2062.907s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: مرحبا سيدي
 شكرا على المقدمة، مايكل.
 مجرد سؤال حول الخدمات التعليمية.
 ويحدث نفس الشيء، خاصة مع المعلمين.
 أه لأنها تتعلق بـ 21 طريقة يكونون بها أعضاء في منظمة كبيرة وما العمل أو العملية التي تقومون بها في أسبوع معين؟
 توفير الموارد القيادية من منظور الكلية لتحقيق الأهداف التعليمية التي تصفها وتوفير الفرص للطلاب.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2116.469s">[Mike Ross]</a>: نعم، أنا أقدر هذا السؤال حقًا.
 أعتقد أنك ستحصل على إجابة أفضل إذا كانت ليزلي تاسا أو الإجابة.
 يا ترى هل يود أحدكم أن يتحدث عن وضعكم في التدريس وما إلى ذلك؟
 لا أعرف إذا كانت ليلي أم أعني أنه يمكنني المحاولة بناءً على ما قلناه.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2139.85s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>: وبعد ذلك لم أتمكن من إزالته.
 ولهذا السبب لم أجب.
 السيدات والسادة، السيدات والسادة، اجتمع الخبراء والموظفون وأعضاء مجلس الإدارة هذا المساء للسماح لنا بتقديم عرض.
 لدينا هيكل
 يركز نظام التعليم حقًا على تنمية القوى العاملة وإعادة الناس إلى العمل.
 لدينا مدرب CDL مرخص من الولايات المتحدة.
 لدينا أيضًا قسم حيث يمكن للأشخاص تعلم كيفية تركيب النوافذ أو الألواح الشمسية.
 وهذا يخلق فرص عمل لأعضائنا.
 84% من الأعضاء قاموا بالشراء
 أجر معيشي حتى يتمكنوا من شراء منزل، أجر معيشي دون مساعدة العشار أو أي شيء من هذا القبيل.
 نقوم أيضًا بتدريب الأشخاص والعثور على السير الذاتية ومحو الأمية الرقمية ومهارات الكمبيوتر والأشياء الطبيعية التي يحتاجها الأشخاص أثناء إعادة بناء حياتهم.
 أستطيع أن أقول أن معظم المشاركين عاشوا هذه الحياة.
 حول أنظمة السلطة مثل الرعاية الاجتماعية والضمان الاجتماعي، وكذلك العوامل التي تعيق الوصول إلى العمل اللائق.
 إذن هذه بداية جديدة.
 بالإضافة إلى ذلك، لدينا أيضًا مهارات حياتية.
 لا أعرف إذا كان لدى روثي أو تيشا أي شيء آخر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2284.71s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: إذا واجهت أي صعوبة في سحب أموالك، فيرجى إبلاغ Taisha بذلك، فأنا أعلم أنك ستكون مستعدًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2289.892s">[Taisha Gishard]</a>: مثالي.
 نعم شكرا لك.
 حسنًا، ما سنفعله بدلاً من ذلك هو جلب الأشخاص، كما تعلمون، العملاء الذين يتعين عليهم مغادرة المبنى.
 أنا متأكد من أن بعضًا منها سيتم تنفيذه محليًا، ولكن سيتم تنفيذ معظمه محليًا.
 لذا أتمنى أن أكون قد أجبت على هذا السؤال.
 أتساءل عما إذا كان لدى روثي أي شيء آخر تضيفه؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2324.075s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: شعاع الحرب.
 نعم، ليلة سعيدة.
 حسنًا، آمل أن أتمكن من إضافة المزيد من المعنى لهذه القضية.
 ولذلك، اعتمادًا على عدد الأشخاص الذين نعمل معهم، ستتم مشاركة المعلومات المتعلقة بالصدمات مع جميع مقدمي الخدمات لدينا وشركاء المجتمع الذين لديهم خبرة في العمل مع هؤلاء السكان.
 لذا، كما تعلمون، نحن لا نعزز الثقافة المالية وندعمهم بخدمات دعم الأسرة فحسب، بل نعمل أيضًا مع الأطفال.
 إذن، الثلاثة لديهم أطباء وخدمات الصدمات وخدمات العنف المنزلي.
 في الواقع، لدينا بالفعل خدمات وشراكات مع منظمات أخرى تقوم بذلك.
 لذلك نريد فقط تقديم خدمات كاملة ومستقلة لجميع أفراد الأسرة.
 ولذلك، فإننا لا نقوم بتحديث أي شيء جديد بناءً على خبرتنا في هذا العمل.
 لدينا شركاء عبر الإنترنت يعملون معنا وسيأتون للعمل مع عملائهم.
 والغرض من ذلك هو تقديم الخدمات للأشخاص الذين يقعون فيه.
 لذلك آمل أن أتمكن من إضافة قيمة إلى هذا السؤال.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2400.317s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>: حسنا، التركيز على الصيانة والتجديد.
 لذلك، كما قال، عند إنشاء ملف تعريفي للثقافة المالية، فإن رصيدك الائتماني يمثل عقبة كبيرة.
 لذلك نحن نركز حقًا على الميزانية، والائتمان، وكيفية إدارة الحساب المصرفي، وكيفية الحصول على رهن عقاري.
 هدفنا هو العثور على الناس
 الظروف المعيشية للسكان وأصحاب المنازل مستقرة.
 هذا هو دورنا في العدالة الإسكانية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2438.402s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: آدم سؤال آخر؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2446.665s">[Peter Calves]</a>: أنا لست بصحة جيدة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2448.106s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا لك
 رأيت يدان على الطاولة، ويبدو أنني رأيت أيدي الجمهور.
 تذكير سريع: هذه هي أسئلة وتعليقات المنتدى في الوقت الحالي، وسنستمر في نشر التعليقات العامة.
 آري، أعتقد أن الشيء التالي الذي رأيته هو يدك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2464.962s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: مثالي.
 شكراً سيدي الرئيس، وشكراً للمرشحين الذين خاضوا الانتخابات.
 يبدو أن هذا مشروع رائع سيجلب الكثير من الفوائد للمجتمع.
 سؤالي هو حقا لمسؤولي المدينة و
 كنت أتساءل عما إذا كان بإمكانك أن تخبرنا قليلاً عن الأشياء المشتركة بين المدارس غير التقليدية (أي المدارس العامة، وليس الكليات).
 أعتقد أن هذا سؤال عام.
 لذلك، إذا كان بإمكانك تزويد زوارنا ببعض المعلومات والتاريخ والقواعد، فسوف نقدر ذلك كثيرًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2505.635s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: بالطبع سيدي الرئيس.
 لقد كنت هناك عندما قادتنا هذه الحادثة إلى هذا المشروع المحتمل.
 جلسنا مع روبن شتاين، محامي حزب K، لمناقشة ما إذا كانت هذه الممارسة مقبولة.
 وعندما قال محاميه إن "هذا سيكون بمثابة حفر في دوفر"، أكد أن هذه هي بالفعل الطريقة المعتادة للسماح بمشاريع من هذا النوع.
 وعلى الرغم من أن هذا الملجأ لا يفتح ليلاً، إلا أن الناس يذهبون إلى الفراش ويغادرون أثناء النهار.
 لا يجب أن يكون شيئًا لا نتحدث عنه.
 هذا هو المكان الذي يعيش فيه الناس ويتم توفير خدمات الدعم.
 قال: "إنه مسموح به بشكل عام في الوثيقة".
 أنا لا أفعل ذلك، ولا أهتم بالتكتيكات.
 لست متأكدًا من أن هذا سيساعد، لكنني أعتقد أن محامي المدعين لديهم قضايا أعدها لهم القانون للمرافعة فيها.
 نعتقد أن محامينا يعتقدون أن هذه هي الطريقة القياسية للترخيص بمثل هذا المشروع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2578.155s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: آري، هل تريد سماع هذا الخبر؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2581.076s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: كما تعلمون، ليس من الضروري أن نقرأ كل كلمة، لكني أريد أن أسمع تأكيدًا لذلك.
 أوركون</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2589.82s">[Mike Ross]</a>: حسنًا، أعني، كما تعلم، ربما أقود ماجي إلى الحافة وأنت تضع شريكي في مشكلة.
 ومن أدان كل هذه الأمور؟
 ولكن أعني، أعتقد أنك في ميدفورد، وربما تعرف تافتس، الذي كان هناك، وأنت تعرف وتتبع تعديل دوفر.
 ولكن في الواقع الفكرة هي نفسها.
 الغرض منه هو للأغراض التعليمية.
 السؤال هو هل يوجد مثل هذا المكان؟
 مقبول
 أعتقد أن الحالة الرئيسية هي مستشفى MCLean، وأنا متأكد من أن الجميع قد سمعوا عنها.
 يقدم مستشفى ماكلين العديد من الخدمات التي تمت مناقشتها هنا على نطاق واسع.
 أعتقد أن مستشفى ماكلين سمح في البداية بأن تكون منشأته بالقرب من لينكولن.
 ربما ليس قريبًا، ولكن في ماساتشوستس.
 هذه حالة من ماساتشوستس.
 هذه هي النسخة الوحيدة التي ذكرناها في الوثائق التي ذكرناها في الوثائق التي أرسلناها لكم، وهذا هو ما ذكر، وهذا هو القانون الأخير في هذا المجال الذي استشهدت به المحكمة العليا وما زالت تستشهد به.
 لهذه الأسباب والعديد من الأسباب الأخرى، أعني أنني لا أعرف ماجي إذا كنت أنت
 ماجي روبرتس، محامية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2679.811s">[SPEAKER_19]</a>: وأنا أتفق مع ما قاله مايك: هناك مجموعة كاملة من القواعد، لكنها في الحقيقة لا تلبي الأهداف التعليمية لهذا المفهوم المناسب للعمر.
 أعتقد أنك تعرف أن هذا صحيح وهناك العديد من الحالات الأخرى.
 توجد برامج سكنية حيث يتم تعليم العملاء كيفية العيش بشكل منتج والحفاظ على الاستقلال.
 أعتقد أن هذه الجملة تعني أن التعليم مفهوم واسع.
 نعم، كما قال مايك، يمكنك ذلك.
 نعم، هذا مفهوم واسع يتجاوز المدارس التقليدية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2740.403s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: شكرا لك
 لقد وجدت هذا الاقتباس من حادثة التجميد وكان مفيدًا ومفيدًا.
 وهو الآن على شاشة المشاركة.
 شكرا لإجابتك الشاملة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2755.651s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا علي.
 بيتر، رأيت يدك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2760.853s">[Peter Calves]</a>: لذلك لدي سؤال أريد أن أطرحه على المرشحين وأوضح بعض الأشياء.
 أسئلة للمرشحين: كم عدد الخدمات التعليمية الموجودة؟
 لقد كسرته
 الدراسة لساعات يوميا؟
 أم أن هذا ليس نموذجًا يمكن مقارنته بشيء مماثل؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2798.205s">[Mike Ross]</a>: أعني، نحن على بعد أشهر من الافتتاح وما زال يتعين علينا بناء هذا المكان.
 نحن بحاجة
 انضم رسميًا إلى المجموعة وتحداهم للقيام بهذا العمل.
 لذلك ربما يمكنك أن تطلب منهم التحدث عن تجاربهم في أماكن أخرى وما هي أهدافهم بناءً على قاعدة عملائنا.
 لكن الافتتاح ربما يكون بعد 6 أشهر.
 أريد فقط أن أضع بعضها بين قوسين إن أمكن.
 ربما الأمر كذلك، اشلي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2838.915s">[Peter Calves]</a>: سكرتير
 كما قلت، أريد فقط أن أفهم الخدمات التعليمية المتنوعة التي يقدمها هذا الموقع.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2848.302s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>: لذلك أستطيع أن أقول ذلك من المنازل العشوائية الأخرى التي لدينا.
 أولاً، لا توجد حالتان متماثلتان.
 ليس كل الناس لديهم نفس المشاكل الاجتماعية، أليس كذلك؟
 أولاً، هل لدينا مشرف يقوم بإجراء التقييم؟
 هدفنا هو الاستقرار ثم التدريب والتأهيل والتركيز عليه
 ماذا قلت في الشارع كيف تخرج من المنزل.
 أولاً، لدينا حالة أخرى تتعلق بتقييم الاحتياجات.
 لدينا
 يجب أن تكون الاجتماعات الشهرية اجتماعات عائلية، فلدينا اجتماعات عائلية شهرية ومن ثم اجتماعات أسبوعية لتطوير الموظفين.
 ذلك يعتمد على الفئة التي تنتمي إليها.
 إذا كنت تحصل على CDL، قم بالتسجيل مرتين في الأسبوع.
 يحدث هذا كل يوم عندما تفكر في طاقتك الشمسية.
 يوميا في الموقع من 9 إلى 5.
 غير صحيح
 الدورات المهنية لها متطلبات مختلفة.
 ندرس رقميًا في فترة ما بعد الظهر ثلاث مرات في الأسبوع.
 تعليمي المالي يمكن أن يستمر.
 التعليم المالي الكامل
 عند الضرورة.
 يختلف حاجز الائتمان من شخص لآخر، لذلك يتم تعيين مستشار لكل شخص والذي سيحدد مقدار الوقت الذي يحتاج إلى قضائه مع هذا الشخص المعين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2966.36s">[Peter Calves]</a>: سكرتير
 وهذا يكفي بالنسبة لي، على الأقل لفهمي للبرمجة.
 أوركون</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2980.463s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: بطاقات أخرى
 تعليقات أو أسئلة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2984.459s">[Peter Calves]</a>: أوه انتظر لحظة.
 كنت أعرف أن شيئا قد تغير.
 واحد منهم على الأقل هو تحديد مسار التحكم في الطريق السريع في طريق النقل، وهو عبارة عن خريطة للطريق السريع، وظيفتي اليومية كمهندس نقل، نستخدمها لتحديد الطريق.
 تم تصنيف شارع كلير على أنه طريق عام، لذا فإن هذا يدعم مطالبة مقدم الطلب وهو أمر يتعين علينا مراعاته.
 أعتقد أن السؤال هو، أوه انتظر.
 أعني أن لدي أسئلة للمدينة حول الخيارات المتاحة لهم فيما يتعلق بتعديل دوفر.
 لكنني أعتقد أن محامي روز قام بعمل ممتاز في التدقيق.
 في الواقع، أكتب هذا في ملاحظاتي.
 شكرًا لك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3043.403s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: نعم، شكرا لك، بيدرو.
 هل لدى المجلس أي تعليقات أو أسئلة أخرى؟
 أريد فقط مشاركة بعض الأفكار قبل أن ننتقل إلى فترة التعليق العام.
 أرى الكثير من الناس يتصلون هذا المساء، لذا سأختصر الأمر.
 أعجبني أنك ذكرت الرصيف أمام المبنى.
 ومع ذلك، فإن هذا يترك فجوة كبيرة بين الزاوية وسانت.
 بناء على شارع كلارك.
 أريد أن أعرف المزيد عن هذا، أو ربما يمكننا تحديد شروطنا.
 لا يزال وقوف السيارات يمثل مشكلة في ميدفورد.
 كمدينة، نحن نعمل للتأكد من أننا نفعل الأشياء الصحيحة لتحقيق ذلك.
 لقد شعرت بالقلق قليلاً عندما علمت أن حلول مواقف السيارات لا تزال قيد التطوير.
 لقد سمعت تعليقاتك بخصوص الحافلات وقد يمثل هذا مشكلة للعديد من موظفي المدينة، ولكن أود أن أعرف ما هي قواعد أو قيود وقوف السيارات (إن وجدت) الموجودة حاليًا في سانت بطرسبرغ. لويس.
 كلير أو إذا كان واحدا
 الغرب والغرب، مثل شوارعنا في ميدفورد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3117.738s">[Mike Ross]</a>: أنا متأكد من أن هذه المجموعة كانت لديها انطباع بأن هذا طريق خاص لمشاهدة المعالم السياحية.
 يبدو حقا بهذه الطريقة.
 أنا لا ألومهم على اعتقادهم أن هذا ما حدث.
 كما تعلمون، أعتقد أننا نريد دعم المدينة من خلال وضع الأرصفة أمام المباني.
 لقد تخيلت عند نقطة واحدة.
 كما تعلمون، قد ترغب المدينة في استثمار بعض رأس المال في بناء الأرصفة هناك، حتى لو كان ذلك بقرار من المدينة، لكنني أعتقد على الأقل أنه كان كذلك.
 ضرب حاجبينا.
 يمكننا القيام بدورنا لدعم هذه الجهود، ويمكننا إجراء تعديلات معقولة على الأرض إذا كانت حصة لكلا الطرفين، لكن وزارة الأشغال العامة تريد منا أن نفعل ذلك.
 ثم عندما يكون الرصيف الآخر جاهزًا، تعلم أنه عندما يكون الرصيف الآخر جاهزًا، فإنه سيعمل.
 لكنني أعتقد أن بناء رصيف كامل من تلك الزاوية أمر مكلف للغاية.
 هناك أيضًا الخدمات اللوجستية وبعض الجيران.
 إنه يمنحنا دورًا مختلفًا تمامًا وسعرًا لسنا مستعدين له.
 لكن رداً على هذا التعليق اتفقنا على فتح الرصيف أمام منزلنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3200.055s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: وأنا أقدر هذه التعليقات.

 គ្មានអ្វីដែលនៅចំពោះមុខផ្ទះរបស់មនុស្សម្នាក់គឺឯកជនទេលុះត្រាតែវានៅតាមផ្លូវឯកជន។
 ទោះយ៉ាងណាខ្ញុំនឹងលើកឡើងប្រសិនបើអ្នកឆ្លងកាត់ Fulton Street សូមទោសបានធ្លាក់ចុះយ៉ាងខ្លាំង,
 នៅផ្នែកម្ខាងទៀតនៃផ្លូវ Fulton Street, លាតសន្ធឹងផ្លូវ Fulton នៅទូទាំងតំបន់ Gillis, មានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តទាំងសងខាង។
 យើងបានរកឃើញថាប្រជាជននៅឯអគារនៅកាច់ជ្រុងឧទ្យាន Gillis និង Hickey បានចតនៅលើផ្លូវនោះ។
 ជារឿយៗមានកន្លែងចតផ្លូវដែលអាចរកបាន។
 ប្រសិនបើយើងកំពុងនិយាយអំពីនិយោជិកពីរទៅបីនាក់
 គ្មានហេតុផលណាដែលពួកគេមិនអាចចតនៅផ្នែកម្ខាងទៀតនៃការនៅភាគខាងលិចហើយដើរឬពីរដើម្បីធ្វើការបានទេ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថានេះធ្វើឱ្យយល់បាន។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថាជាទូទៅការផ្តោតអារម្មណ៍របស់យើងទៅលើចំណតគឺសម្រាប់រថយន្តរបស់ប្រជាជន។
 ពីអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំយល់, មនុស្សដែលគ្មានផ្ទះសម្បែងមានទំនោរមិនមានឡានលើកលែងតែពួកគេរស់នៅក្នុងពួកគេ។
 នេះគឺជាកន្លែងដែលពួកគេនៅមុនពេលមកដល់ទីជំរក។
 ចំណុចមួយទៀតគឺថាប្រសិនបើមនុស្សម្នាក់គឺជាជនរងគ្រោះនៃអំពើហិង្សាក្នុងគ្រួសារវាមិនចាំបាច់មានន័យថាមនុស្សនោះមានប្រាក់ចំណូលទាបទេ។
 ពួកគេប្រហែលជាត្រូវទៅទីជំរកព្រោះពួកគេកំពុងរត់ពីនរណាម្នាក់ប៉ុន្តែវាមិនមានន័យថាពួកគេមិនមានឡានទេ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាទីភ្នាក់ងាររៀបចំពិតជាត្រូវការពិចារណារឿងនេះពីព្រោះបច្ចុប្បន្ននេះមិនមានកន្លែងចតរថយន្តរយៈពេលវែងសម្រាប់រថយន្តស៊ីវិលទេ។
 តម្រូវការមួយក្នុងចំណោមតម្រូវការដែលត្រូវបានណែនាំនៅក្នុងអគារជាច្រើននិងអ្វីដែលយើងបានធ្វើសម្រាប់អគារផ្ទះល្វែងដែលមានសមត្ថភាពខ្ពស់ដោយមិនគិតពីប្រភេទអគារ
 អ្នកជួលមិនមានសិទ្ធិទទួលបានការអនុញ្ញាតចំណតរថយន្តលំនៅដ្ឋានទេ។
 នេះក៏ជាលក្ខខណ្ឌសម្រាប់ករណីនេះត្រូវអនុវត្តផងដែរ។
 ខ្ញុំយល់ថាបច្ចុប្បន្នមិនមានការអនុញ្ញាតចតនៅក្នុងសហគមន៍នេះទេ។
 នេះមានន័យថានឹងមិនដែលមានប័ណ្ណចំណតរថយន្តទេ។
 នេះអាចជាករណីនាពេលអនាគតអាស្រ័យលើរយៈពេលសាងសង់។
 សូមអរគុណ។</p>

 صباح الخير
 شكرا لكم على تنظيم هذا الاجتماع.
 اسمي ليزا سيزونتي وأعيش في 85 فولتون سبرينج.
 لذا فإن القديسين وأنا في نفس الجانب.
 فرانسيسكو وريدجواي.
 للمرة الثالثة على التوالي.
 لذلك لدي بعض الأسئلة.
 آمل أن أتمكن من زيارتهم.
 أريد الحصول على إجابات منهم حول هذا الموضوع.
 أريد أن أعرف ما هو الحد الأقصى للمبلغ الذي تتحدث عنه.
 لقد قلت أن هذا المأوى مصمم لـ 40 شخصًا.
 لذلك اكتشفنا الليلة أن هذا ملجأ للعنف المنزلي وأتفهم أن الناس بحاجة إلى مكان آمن، لكن 40 ساكنًا في مجتمع مزدحم أو كم عدد الأطفال؟
 أود أن أعرف الحد الأقصى لمبلغ الإيجار.
 أعلم أن مدينة دوفر تدور حول إصلاح جاد للتعليم.
 بصراحة، نظرًا لما أصبحت عليه منطقة فولتون إيدجيز المزدحمة، فإن مقارنتها بمستشفى ماكلين في بلمونت سكرول سيكون غير مناسب إلى حد ما.
 بعض المنازل في شارع فولتون متاحة الآن للإيجار في منطقة شارع ريديس.
 تعتبر طرق فرانشويكس وسبرينج سبرينغز طرقًا خاصة وتحافظ على هذه الطرق في حالة جيدة وهي متدهورة في مدينتنا.
 لدينا اختناقات مرورية، وبصراحة، أريد أن أعرف متى يقومون بدراسات المرور.
 وأنا أتفق مع شعب سانت لويس.
 كراري لأنها كنيستي الرعوية ومخرج للطوارئ.
 ولا يزال البعض يحتفل به في كنيسة القديس يوحنا.
 Francerucco Parish ماذا كان سيحدث يومي السبت والأحد لو لم يكن هناك إطفاء، لا سمح الله، ولم تتمكن سيارات الإطفاء من المرور بسبب موقف السيارات والطريق المؤدي إلى المنحدر القديم؟
 ولنقول أن استخدامها هو نفسه تمامًا، أولاً، المبنى كان فارغًا لسنوات عديدة.
 بالمقارنة مع 15 أو 18 راهبة يعشن هناك ولم يمتلكن سيارة أو أي شيء آخر غير موظفين بدوام كامل 24 ساعة في السنة، لا يوجد احترام للضحايا في المناطق المزدحمة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4114.868s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا لك السيد ليزا.
 أنا حقا أقدر ملاحظاتك.
 وسوف نقتبس الردود على أي أسئلة حول المرشحين حتى نهاية فترة التعليق العام.

 نحن نعيش في 463 Failsway West وبابي الأمامي يقع على الجانب الآخر من شارع St.
 شارع كلارا.
 مرة أخرى، لست متأكدًا من دراسة المرور التي قمت بها.
 لدي نفس المشكلة مع حارة المرور، فهي صغيرة جدا.
 لا يوجد سوى زقاق صغير بين الباب الخلفي للكنيسة ومسار كنيسة القديس بطرس.
 ضحك فرانسيسكو بصوت عال.
 ولدينا مكانان لوقوف السيارات على أرض شخص ما.
 الطريق الذي يبلغ عرضه 10 أمتار مناسب للحركة.
 وبالتالي، ستتأثر مواقف السيارات وحركة المرور في المنطقة بالتأكيد.
 أعلم أنك قلت أن الناس لن يتنقلوا، لكني أستطيع أن أرى أن ذلك سيؤثر على المساحتين المتاحتين لدينا لأننا لا نستطيع الوقوف أمام منزلنا وسيؤثر علينا بالقرب من منزلنا.
 كنت قلقة أيضًا بشأن الذهاب إلى ملجأ المشردين القريب.
 لقد قمنا ببناء هذه الشقق منذ بضع سنوات فقط، مما أدى إلى زيادة عدد السكان واستهلاك المياه وما إلى ذلك في المنطقة.
 أشعر بخيبة أمل كبيرة.
 لدي ابن من ذوي الاحتياجات الخاصة.
 إنه أمر مزعج عندما يحدث هذا
 أشعر أن هذه مسألة تتعلق بسلامة ابني وعائلتي، وأنا موافق على ذلك.
 لا أستطيع أن أصدق أننا سمعنا عن ملجأ تربل للمشردين الليلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4248.935s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا لك يا جمال.
 ليو، هل تريد التحدث؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4257.962s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: أعتقد أنني بحاجة إلى إعادتهم إلى المسار الصحيح.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4279.768s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: هل يمكنني الحصول على اسم وعنوان مسجلين؟</p>

 هذه هي كنيسة الرعية التي ذهبت إليها في سانت بطرسبرغ. لويس.

 إحدى مشاكلي هي أن لديك الكثير من العمل للبالغين المشغولين.
 من سيعتني بالأطفال ليلا ونهارا؟
 أين سيلعبون؟
 ثانياً، أريد أن أسأل: هل هم أميركيون أم أنهم يرحبون بالمهاجرين غير الشرعيين؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4317.87s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: وسوف نرفض الرد على أي تعليقات عامة حتى بعد جلسة الاستماع العامة.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4325.916s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: أوه، كنت أفكر فقط في الأطفال.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4328.9s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: نعم، سوف نقوم بالرد على جميع التعليقات العامة في نهاية المطاف.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4332.983s">[SPEAKER_11]</a>: أوه، آسف.
 أعتقد أن هذه هي مشكلتي.

 أعتقد أنك تجيب على السؤال.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4341.188s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: نحن نحاول جمع أسئلة الجميع معًا لأنني متأكد من أن الكثير من الأشخاص لديهم مشكلات مماثلة، ولكننا نريد أن نسمع من الجميع.

 أنا قلق بشأن سلامة هذا المبنى.
 أتلقى الكثير من المكالمات من جميع الشقق الأربع.
 إذا وقع الحادث في الطابق الثالث أو الثاني أو الرابع أو الرابع، هل يوجد مصعد أو خدمة طوارئ لصعود الدرج الأربعة؟
 هل Ada Ada هو من أنشأ الإعلانات الإعلانية؟
 أعتقد أنه كمؤسسة تعليمية يجب أن تتبع ADA.
 كان في كل مكان على الأرض.
 لذلك أريد أن أجد الإجابة على هذا السؤال.
 أريد أيضًا أن أعرف سبب عدم ظهور دراسات حركة المرور للآخرين.
 أريد أن أحاول تأجيل ذلك للمستقبل لأنني أريد استشارة محامٍ والنظر في الدراسة المرورية.
 أنا أتساءل أيضًا عما إذا كان هذا قد تمت الموافقة عليه من قبل ADA.
 كنت قلقة بشأن الحريق والأطفال في المبنى.
 إذا حدث شيء ما في الطابق العلوي، فسيتعين عليهم الانتظار حتى يصل رجال الإنقاذ إلى الطابق الثالث أو الرابع. كيف سينقذونهم؟

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4510.987s">[SPEAKER_36]</a>: اسمي كيفن وونغ من 1 ستريت، كلارا.
 أشكركم على إتاحة الفرصة لي للتحدث.
 يبدو هذا الاقتراح رائعًا وأعتقد أنه قد يفيد العميل بشكل كبير إذا تم تنفيذه بشكل جيد.
 ولكن كعضو في المجتمع الذي يقع فيه الملجأ، أشعر بالقلق بشأن استدامة المشروع على المدى الطويل.
 أريد أيضًا التأكد من عدم وجود تأثير سلبي طويل المدى على المجتمع.
 لذلك أريد التأكيد على نقطتين.
 أولا، وفقا للمعلومات الموجودة على الإنترنت، فإن العقار ينتمي إلى المطور.
 أولئك الذين يرغبون في الاستفادة من هذا العقار ستتم إدارته بواسطة Road Alliance، التي اكتشفت أن عمرها 3 أشهر فقط وتم إنشاؤها بواسطة وكيل عقاري.
 أعتقد أن كتابة جملة بالاسم أمر سهل، ولكن من الصعب تنفيذه.
 ثانياً: يوفر المقترح خدمات النقل ولكن بدون مواقف سيارات أو مواصلات عامة مباشرة.
 هل تستطيع الملاجئ تحقيق أهدافها التعليمية ومساعدة العملاء على التعافي؟
 لذا، بناءً على هاتين النقطتين، إذا جاز لي أن أسأل المجلس، يجب على المجلس أن ينظر في التأثير طويل المدى للسماح بتعديل دوفر في هذا التطبيق.
 التأكد من وجود آليات لضمان مساءلة المتقدمين والمشغلين عن متابعة أهداف التعليم المستمر.
 وعلى حد علمي لا يوجد دليل على أنها استمرت في خدمة هذا الغرض لأي فترة من الزمن.
 هذا كل شيء.
 وأنا ممتن للمجلس لاستماعه لي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4611.546s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا لك كيفن.
 نحن نقدر وقتك.
 إستيبان أنجيلوني.
 أراك اثنين.
 هل الجميع يريد التحدث؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4625.193s">[SPEAKER_16]</a>: أعتقد ذلك.
 سأحاول أن أكون مختصرا.
 إيجا أنجيلي وستيفن أنجيلوني.
 نحن على الطريق الأول.
 عمارة سكنية على ناصية شارع كلا.
 أعتقد أن لدينا جميعا نفس السؤال حول ما إذا كان تعديل دوفر يتم تطبيقه بشكل صحيح أم فضفاض للغاية.
 أنا أفهم ذلك لأنه
 لا تقوم المنظمات غير الربحية بحمايتك تلقائيًا عند إلغاء DOVER إذا كان المصدر الأساسي لاستخدام الموقع ليس التعليم.
 يبدو لي أن المصدر الرئيسي لهذا النبات هو التعليم، وربما يكون هذا جزءًا من التخطيط، رغم أنني أعترف أن هذا غير واضح ولا يزال هناك 6 أشهر، لذلك لم يتم تطويره بعد.
 أعتقد أنني أريد أن أكرر وجهة نظر ليزا وبعضًا من تأثير كيفن على المجتمع.
 أعتقد أننا بشكل عام قلقون للغاية بشأن التغييرات في نظام الأمان والاختناقات المرورية. إلخ.
 لكن باعتباري ملجأ للعنف المنزلي، أعتقد أنني أهتم أيضًا بالعنف المنزلي، وبالأشخاص الذين أعتبرهم ضحايا.
 لا أعلم، الهروب من استكشاف هذه المنطقة قد يزيد من مستوى الخطر هنا.
 أريد أن أعرف عن القضايا الأمنية.
 أنت تقول أن هناك أمن، ولكن ماذا يعني ذلك؟
 ماذا يعني ذلك؟
 بشكل عام، أنا قلق بعض الشيء بشأن التأثيرات طويلة المدى علينا التي نمر بها خلال هذه الفترة كل ليلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4746.965s">[SPEAKER_23]</a>: الاسم والعنوان.
 مرحبا، مرحبا.
 اسمي ميغيل رويز.
 أنا أعيش في شارع 45.
 شارع فرانسيس، بعد أبيتا مباشرة.
 أعتقد أنني، مثل العديد من جيراني، أشعر بالقلق إزاء تأثير ذلك على المجتمع.
 حسنًا، لكن هذا هو حالي.
 شكك في صلاحية قانون دوفر.
 أعني، في برنامج شهادتي، أدركت أنني عملت كموظف حكومي لمدة عام.
 باعتباري وكيلًا، أستطيع أن أقول إننا بحاجة إلى تدريب القوى العاملة لأننا نخسرها، لكنني لا أرى كيف يمكنك تدريب شخص ما على القيام بمراكز السيطرة على الأمراض والوقاية منها يومين في الأسبوع.
 كيف يمكنهم القيام بذلك في موقف للسيارات به مدرج؟
 يعد تركيب الألواح الشمسية فكرة جيدة مرة أخرى، ولكن هل سيتم تعليقها على المبنى؟
 أعني أن هناك حدًا لما يمكنك القيام به في الفصل.
 معظمهم لديهم تدريب مهني يحتاجون إلى إكماله.
 اهتمامي الآخر هو المجتمع ككل.
 أنا أفهم الطبيعة البشرية.
 الناس لا يريدون انتظار العبارة.
 سوف يتأخرون عن العمل.
 وهم يعرفون كيفية قيادة السيارة.
 سوف يوقفون سياراتهم في شارع لويس.
 ضحك فرانسيسكو بصوت عال.
 لا يوجد موقف للسيارات على الطريق.
 أصبح شارع فران لويس على ما هو عليه اليوم بفضل المنازل والشقق المستأجرة في شارع فولتون.
 العديد من العقارات متعددة اللغات هنا مليئة الآن بالمستأجرين.
 يستأجرون غرفة.
 إنه ليس سعيدًا بسماح المدينة بذلك.
 لكنني لا أعتقد أن هذه الخطة جيدة حقًا.
 لا أعتقد أنهم سيحلون مشكلة وقوف السيارات.
 أعتقد أن مسألة التعليم برمتها ليست واضحة.
 لقد تم استخدامه للتو
 لحماية الناس.
 وكما أشار السيد هوانغ، عندما لم تعد هذه الخطة الخاصة تدعم نفسها، كيف سيتم استخدام هذا المبنى في المستقبل؟
 ماذا اكتشفنا لأنفسنا؟
 كما أنها تثير قلق بعض الجيران.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4860.138s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا على وقتك.
 شكرا لك مايكل.
 وأنا أقدر ملاحظاتك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4871.505s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: التالي هو أنجوس هو.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4876.686s">[SPEAKER_38]</a>: نعم، نعم، اسمي بانجاس هو.
 أنا أعيش في الشارع
 عمارات مستنسخة تقع في نفس شارع المبنى.
 لذا أود أن أضيف أن الجيران الآخرين اقترحوا على جيراني أن يطلبوا من المجلس التحقيق مع المطور.
 كما تعلمون، لقد أجريت القليل من البحث وأنت تعلم
 المستثمر هو مطور سكني فاخر في سومرفيل، كامبريدج.
 ثم، ونظراً للسياق التاريخي، علمنا العام الماضي أنه سيتم تحويل المبنى إلى 9 شقق للبيع العام.
 اكتشفنا لاحقًا أنه بسبب تواصلهم مع جمعية الملاك لاستئجار مكان لوقوف السيارات في المبنى الخاص بنا، لم يتمكنوا من تلبية المتطلبات المحلية لأنهم لم يتمكنوا من العثور على مكان لوقوف السيارات للشقة.
 انتهى بنا الأمر باستئجار مكان لوقوف السيارات منهم.
 ونتيجة لذلك، قد لا تنجح مشاريع الشقق الفاخرة.
 وقد تم الآن تحويل المشروع إلى مشروع مأوى.
 وكما ذكر كيفن أيضًا، تم إنشاء هذه المنظمة غير الربحية لتنفيذ هذا البرنامج.
 يبلغ عمر الملجأ 3 أشهر فقط، وقد تم إنشاؤه بعد محاولات تحويله إلى شقة فاخرة.
 لكن هذا لم يحدث، وتم إنشاء هذه المنظمة غير الربحية لبناء الملاجئ.
 مرة أخرى، أشجع مجالس الإدارة على النظر في نواياها هنا لأنني أشعر بالقلق بشأن الاستدامة على المدى الطويل إذا ركز المطورون هنا على الربحية.

 اسمي إميلي لازاتو.
 أنا أعيش على امتداد الطريق 170 مرة.
 أنا عضو في مجلس مدينة ميدفورد.
 وأود أن أعرب عن دعمي لهذا المشروع.
 وأشكر هذه المنظمات على عملها معًا لتحقيق ذلك.
 أنا واحد من شعبي
 الروتين اليومي في مركز الاحتباس الحراري الكبير.
 أنا أهتم بشدة بالأشخاص الذين يواجهون هذه الأنواع من المشاكل.
 العثور على سكن أمر صعب، خاصة بالنسبة لمن لديهم أطفال.
 لا تستطيع منظمتي رعاية الأطفال، لذا فإن الأمر صعب، خاصة عند مواجهة مثل هذا الموقف. أقدر تعاطفك و
 الإخلاص لهذا الشعب.
 كما أنني أشجع المجلس على أن يتذكر أنه ستكون هناك دائمًا مشاكل.
 أعتقد أن هذا طلب من هذه المجموعة.
 الملف المشترك مكتمل.
 أعتقد أنه يمكن النظر إلى ذلك، ولكن أعتقد أيضًا أن الوقت قد حان للاسترشاد بالذاكرة وتذكر أنه ستكون هناك قرارات صعبة وسيواجه الناس العديد من الصعوبات وسيحاولون مساعدة الآخرين والمحاولة.
 ابحث عن طرق لمساعدة بعضكم البعض وإظهار التعاطف والتعاطف.
 أعتقد أن هذا هو أفضل طريق للمضي قدمًا.
 سأكون فخوراً بميدفورد إذا تمكنا من استخدام مبنى شاغر مثل هذا لأغراض التخطيط.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=5100.545s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا لك، المستشار لازارو.

 شيريل ر. يرجى إدراج الاسم والعنوان.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=5119.768s">[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>: مرحبًا، اسمي شيريل رودريجيز.
 أنا أعيش في 281 بارك ستريت، وقالت أليسيا هانتر إنه كان بإمكان هؤلاء الأشخاص ركن سياراتهم في ذلك المبنى لكنهم لم يستطيعوا ذلك بسبب الازدحام المروري.
 لا نستطيع أن نتحملك.
 أعتقد أن الجيران أثاروا الكثير من النقاط الجيدة.
 ومن المؤسف أن مجلس المدينة وافق على تجاهل كل هذه النقاط.
 لكن الشركة جديدة.
 ولا نعرف ما إذا كانوا سيتمكنون من تنفيذ هذا المشروع.
 إذا كان ركن السيارة صعبًا للغاية، فقد يتجاهلون التعليمات ويبقون مختبئين.
 بدلاً من.
 ولذلك فإن التصريحات التي تفيد بأن إعادة الدعم أو المساعدة في الحصول على استمارة السكن ستضر بالمركز التعليمي لأنه غير موجود.
 إذا قمت ببناء ملجأ على الرصيف أمام محطة الحافلات، فلن يتمكن الملجأ الخاص بك من الانتشار.
 هذه منطقة ضيقة جدًا.
 لذلك إذا كان موقف السيارات قيد الاستخدام
 لا يمكنهم العودة أبدا.
 لذلك أعتقد أن الرياضيات خاطئة.
 وأتساءل أيضًا عن نوع الطلاب الذين تم نقلهم هنا.
 هل يذهبون إلى مدرسة ميدفورد؟
 هل هذا مأوى للمهاجرين؟
 هل يحتاج الجميع إلى خدمات LL؟
 أنا متأكد من أن الجميع هنا يعلمون أننا اتفقنا بالأمس على إلغاء فصلين دراسيين لأن مدرستنا كانت مكتظة.
 أضفنا 103 طلاب EL في مارس 2024 ولكننا لم نتمكن من دعمهم.
 إذا كان الأمر كذلك، فلدينا مشكلة أخرى.
 أريد فقط أن أوضح.
 إذا لم يكن لديهم إجابات على هذه الأسئلة، أقترح ألا يستمروا في الإضراب لأنه لم تكن هناك خطة موضوعة ولم يكونوا مستعدين لها.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=5285.845s">[Margaret Kirchmeyer]</a>: اسمي ماجي كيرشمر.
 أنا أعيش في شارع 25.
 كان شارع فرانسيس ومنزلي يمران بموقف سيارات الكنيسة.
 أحد الأسئلة التي لدي حول دراسة موقف السيارات هو أنني لست متأكدًا مما تم فعله بالضبط في الدراسة، لكنني رأيت موقف السيارات.
 إن الجمع بين الدفن والقداس، والوظائف المختلفة التي تخدمها، يقع في مركز المجتمع.
 أنا قلقة بشأن سلامة الأطفال وليس لدي منطقة لعب حقيقية لهؤلاء الأطفال. أعني، كما تعلم، أعلم أنك تحدثت عن بناء ملعب أو منطقة لعب صغيرة.
 على جدار المبنى أو في أي مكان آخر.
 لكن الأطفال لا يريدون البقاء في المنزل 24/7.
 سوف يريدون الذهاب وسوف يذهبون.
 كما تعلمون، لقد كانت مجرد طبيعة طفولية.
 وكما تعلمون، إذا كان هناك الكثير من السيارات القادمة والذهاب، يمكن أن يتعرض الأطفال للهجوم أو الإصابة بجروح خطيرة.
 أعني، كما تعلمون، الأمر مقلق.
 كما تعلمون، كانت هناك بالفعل زيادة في حركة المرور من الشاحنات الصغيرة وخدمات التوصيل التي تتحدث عنها.
 مرة أخرى، المخاطر الأمنية.
 سيدي، أنا ممرضة متقاعدة أعمل في قطاع الرعاية المعيشية، عملت هناك لمدة 8 سنوات قبل التقاعد.
 أقوم بالتوظيف والتعيين، وكما تعلم، من الصعب العثور على موظف كفؤ والاحتفاظ به.
 كما تعلمون، أنا قلق بشأن الفريق 24 ساعة في اليوم، 7 أيام في الأسبوع.
 ولكن ماذا يحدث في عطلة نهاية الأسبوع عندما لا يعمل المدير في عطلة نهاية الأسبوع؟
 وبقدر ما أعرف، لا يتم القيام بذلك في كثير من الأحيان.
 إذًا، هل تعرف ماذا سيحدث إذا كان لديك عدد أقل من الموظفين في عطلات نهاية الأسبوع وكانت هناك مشاكل مع الأشخاص الذين يعيشون في المنزل؟
 وقد يشمل ذلك الشرطة وسيارات الإسعاف وإدارات الإطفاء، بالإضافة إلى هذه الحالة.
 أخيرًا، سؤالي هو: ما الذي أخذه المجتمع في الاعتبار قبل تطوير هذه الخطة بأكملها؟
 لا أتذكر أنني تلقيت أي معلومات عبر البريد حول ما سيحدث هنا.

 نعم، إنه آمن، لكنه يؤثر أيضًا على المجتمع.
 حسنًا، لقد مررنا للتو ببعض التغييرات لمواصلة تمويل مدارسنا، أين سيتم تمويل هؤلاء الأطفال بالفعل؟
 حسنًا.
 مهتم أيضًا بمعرفة المزيد.
 حسب عدد السكان.
 أعلم أن هناك 40 غرفة هنا، ولكن إذا كانت غرفة مزدوجة أو ثلاثية أو رباعية، فسوف يسعدك مشاركتها معنا.
 قرأت الوثيقة ولم أرى شيئا من هذا القبيل.
 تم تحميل بعض الملفات على جوجل، على عكس ما تم عرضه هذا المساء.
 كما أطلب وأحتج على أن يدرس مجلس الإدارة الأمر بعناية وألا يستمع إلى رأي المحامي.
 أنت تمثل المدينة والناس، لذلك نتوقع منك أن تقوم بعملك ولا تثق في جميع المحامين لأنهم يقولون ذلك وتقرأ المستندات التي مضى عليها أقل من 3 أشهر.
 أعتقد أيضًا أننا أجرينا انتخابات متقاربة بالأمس مع وجود أربعة خيارات في ميدفورد وحدها.
 سيكون لدينا هذا الاجتماع مساء اليوم التالي.
 يبدو الأمر كما لو أنهم وضعوه في تقويم ثم أخفوه حتى لا يعلق الناس.
 لذلك أعتقد، قبل اتخاذ القرار، تخصيص يوم إضافي، إضافة إلى اليوم التالي للانتخابات البلدية.</p>

 أعيش في شارع 29، بجوار هذا المبنى.
 الآن، عندما سمعت أن المبنى سيتم بيعه كمبنى سكني، صدمت.
 وبما أن المبنى صغير، فلا أعتقد أن هناك مساحة كافية للأطفال والنساء في هذا المبنى الصغير.
 كما أن الرصيف ضيق جداً ولا يوجد مواقف عامة خاصة في هذا المبنى.
 سيؤدي ذلك إلى ضغوط ومشاكل إضافية على الطرق القريبة.
 شيء آخر الآن
 40 شخصًا، ما يقرب من 40 عائلة، يعيشون في 40 غرفة، ولا نعرف كم منهم سيعيشون هنا.
 سأضيف المزيد من عدم اليقين إلى مستقبل مجتمعنا.
 أنا مقيم جديد.
 لقد تغيرت منذ بضعة أشهر فقط.
 لذلك، عندما... قبل أن أشتري هذا المنزل، وجدت مكانًا جميلًا ورائعًا... لقد كانت منطقة جميلة وهادئة وهادئة وسلمية.
 جيران طيبون، شوارع هادئة، كما تعلمون.
 الجزء الخلفي من منزلي يشبه الكنيسة.
 كل شيء لا يصدق.
 لهذا السبب اشتريت هذا المنزل.
 لذلك أنا سعيد للغاية، ولكن...
 عندما سمعت هذه الأخبار، أضافت الكثير من عدم اليقين إلى مستقبل عائلتي، لذلك كنت قلقة للغاية.
 لذا فأنا أتساءل عن كيفية التعامل مع هذا حتى نشعر بأن الجيران أكثر أمانًا ويشعر الجيران بالأمان أكثر.</p>

 شكرًا لمجلس الإدارة على السماح بعقد جلسة الاستماع هذه، شكرًا لمايكل روس وفريقه.

 كما تعلمون، أنا أقدر الحاجة إلى معالجة التشرد.
 لكني دهشت كيف حدث ذلك.
 كما تعلمون، الناس الذين يعيشون في لويس يحبوننا.
 شارع فرانسيسكو.
 اكتشفت كلير هذا اليوم.
 كما تعلمون، هذا هو إنجاز Feytty.
 وبطبيعة الحال، بذلنا الكثير من الجهد في الإعداد والعرض.
 هكذا
 أريد فقط أن أعطي رأيي فيما قاله جيراني ليندا، لي، لي، ماجي، وايمان وآخرون.
 قصتين الليلة.
 أحدهما يتعلق بمواقف السيارات الآمنة وتأثيرها على كنيسة القديس يوحنا.
 القديس فرنسيس الأسيزي.
 وهذا أحد أسباب انتقالنا إلى هنا.
 هذه كنيسة جميلة خلف منزلنا.
 حركة المياه ويبدو أن شيئًا ما قد تم إهماله.
 والجزء الآخر هو أن هناك الكثير من الجهلة.
 هل يقول أحد أن هذا طريق خاص أم طريق عام؟
 يمكن أن تؤثر على كل شيء.
 يقول البعض أن المنظمة غير الربحية كانت مفتوحة لمدة ثلاثة أشهر فقط.
 متوافق مع ADA.
 عدد كبير جدًا من الغرباء وبيانات غير كافية.
 في النهاية، أعتقد أن قضية التعليم برمتها هي المسؤولة.
 يبدو أن هذا وهم لأنه لا يبدو أن هذا هو الغرض الرئيسي للمنزل في عيد الهالوين.
 سأكون ممتنًا حقًا إذا تمكن الجميع من التواصل شخصيًا.
 لو لم أقرأ هذا المقال، لكنت ضد ما يحدث هنا تمامًا لكل الأسباب المذكورة.

 سان فرانسيسكو، سان فرانسيسكو
 واضح جدا.
 مزدحم.
 كما قال مايكل رويز، وقوف السيارات أمر مستحيل، خاصة في سانت بطرسبرغ. لويس.
 ضحك فرانسيسكو بصوت عال.
 لا يوجد موقف سيارات في شارع فولتون.
 وهناك طرق مختلفة، ولكن هؤلاء الناس لديهم طريقهم الخاص.
 لقد كان حرفيًا عبر الشارع من المكان الذي أعيش فيه.
 لهذا السبب أنا قلق بشأن مواقف السيارات والوضع السكاني.
 بصراحة، بالكاد توجد مساحة لرصيف أمام هذا المبنى لأنها كنيسة، أليس كذلك؟
 إذا كان هناك حريق، حريق، يحتاج شخص ما إلى سيارة إسعاف، فمن الصعب جدًا أن تصل هذه السيارات إلى أي شخص.
 لذلك أعتقد
 وبما أن الخطة تظهر ذلك من جهة، فإنهم يعتقدون أنهم سيبنون الطريق من جهة أخرى.
 سوف يزرعون الشجيرات والزهور وسيكون كل شيء جميلاً.
 لكن بصراحة، يبدو أنه لم يعد هناك مكان متبقي.
 ولذلك، ولجميع الأسباب المذكورة أعلاه، أعلنوا عن وجود عدد كبير من مواقف السيارات. ما هو عدد سكان موقف السيارات؟
 خاصة بعض الأطفال، كما تعلمون، إذا مرض الناس واحتاجوا إليها وقد يكون هناك حريق، فلن يكون هناك مساحة كافية لهذه السيارات.

 ខ្ញុំរស់នៅតាមដងផ្លូវស៊ីនឡែនចំនួន 1 ។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំគិតថាដំបូងបង្អស់បន្ទាប់ពីបាន hearing យោបល់របស់មនុស្សគ្រប់រូបការស្តាប់នេះគឺមិនគ្រប់ខែទេ។
 យោងទៅតាមមេធាវីសូមអភ័យទោសខ្ញុំបានភ្លេចឈ្មោះរបស់គាត់ហើយឡេសលីនៅលើកម្មវិធីនេះខ្ញុំគិតថាពួកគេពិតជាមិនបានគ្របដណ្តប់លើអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបានធ្វើនោះទេ។
 ដូច្នេះមានប្រតិកម្មជាច្រើន។
 ហើយខ្ញុំបានថ្លែងថា "ខ្ញុំជឿជាក់លើរឿងនេះខ្ញុំជឿជាក់ថានេះខ្ញុំមិនប្រាកដទេនេះនៅតែមានជម្លោះ" ។
 នេះមិនមែនជាផែនការទេ។
 វាដូចជាការធ្វើឱ្យមានបំណងចៃដន្យនៅក្នុងប្រភពទឹកហើយនាំវាទៅសហគមន៍ដែលរងផលប៉ះពាល់របស់ប្រជាជន 100 នាក់ឬច្រើនជាងនេះ។
 ផ្អែកលើអ្វីដែលខ្ញុំបាន heard និងអានអំពីសំណើររហូតមកដល់ពេលនេះផែនការដុតនំនេះត្រូវបានបង្ហាញដោយមិនគិតច្រើន។
 ដូចគ្នានេះផងដែរខ្ញុំគិតថាការប្រើប្រាស់ការធ្វើវិសោធនកម្មរបស់ DOVER ទាំងមូលគឺពិតជាលាក់ពុតណាស់ដែលបានស្តាប់ពីវាធ្វើឱ្យខ្ញុំភ័យខ្លាច។
 ដើម្បីដកស្រង់ករណីរបស់ McLean ខ្លួនឯងវាហាក់ដូចជាការស៊ើបការណ៍សម្ងាត់ដ៏ល្អបំផុតរបស់ប្រជាជនដែលបានរៀបរាប់ខាងលើស្ថិតនៅខាងលើគឺស្ថិតនៅក្នុងខ្សែក្រវ៉ាត់ពណ៌បៃតងនិងកន្លែងបើកចំហជាជាងនៅក្នុងតំបន់ផ្ទះឬតំបន់លំនៅដ្ឋានក្នុងទិសដៅណាមួយ។
 ខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែចង់បញ្ជាក់
 ទីមួយវាជាជំរកអបិយជំនឿដែលជាផ្នែកមួយនៃសំណើរបស់ក្រុមហ៊ុនអចលនទ្រព្យដែលកំពុងព្យាយាមរកប្រាក់ចំណេញពីវាហើយវាធ្វើឱ្យវាចូលទៅក្នុងការធ្វើវិសោធនកម្មរបស់ Dover ។
 ខ្ញុំគិតថា Kevin ឬ Payne ប្រហែលជាបានលើកឡើងពីមុនថាក្រុមហ៊ុនតែមួយកំពុងព្យាយាមបំលែងអគារដូចគ្នាទៅក្នុងផ្ទះល្វែងប្រណីតហើយពួកគេបានទាក់ទងអាមេរិកពីរបីនាក់ដែលកំពុងព្យាយាមទិញឬជួលកន្លែងចតរថយន្តរបស់យើង។
 ដូច្នេះខ្ញុំលើកទឹកចិត្តឱ្យក្រុមប្រឹក្សាភិបាលពិតជាជីកចូលទៅក្នុងការលើកទឹកចិត្តនៅពីក្រោយគម្រោងនេះពីព្រោះផ្អែកលើការកំណត់ពេលវេលាវាច្បាស់ណាស់ថាតើអ្នកអភិវឌ្ឍន៍កំពុងព្យាយាមសម្រេចបានយ៉ាងដូចម្តេច។
 ផ្នែកដែលរំខានខ្ញុំបំផុតគឺ:
 អ្នកដឹងថាក្នុងនាមជាអ្នកដែលត្រូវបានចិញ្ចឹមដោយម្តាយតែមួយនៅក្នុងផ្ទះសម្រាប់ជនរងគ្រោះក្នុងផ្ទះវាគួរឱ្យស្អប់ខ្ពើមក្នុងការមើលឃើញសំណើនេះរបៀបដែលពួកគេផ្លាស់ប្តូរទស្សនៈរបស់ពួកគេពីការសម្តែងជម្រកអនាថាសម្រាប់គោលបំណងអប់រំសម្រាប់គោលបំណងអប់រំសម្រាប់គោលបំណងអប់រំសម្រាប់គោលបំណងអប់រំសម្រាប់គោលបំណងអប់រំសម្រាប់គោលបំណងអប់រំ។
 ដូច្នេះអ្នកដឹងទេខ្ញុំគ្រាន់តែស្នើសុំឱ្យក្រុមប្រឹក្សាដកខ្លួនចេញហើយឱ្យយើងមានពេលវេលាបន្ថែមទៀតពេលវេលាប្រជុំបន្ថែមទៀតទៀតដើម្បីគិតពិចារណាឱ្យបានម៉ត់ចត់និងលម្អិតបន្ថែមទៀតមុននឹងធ្វើការសម្រេចចិត្ត។

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=6436.407s">[Jen Proctor]</a>: اسمي جاك كون.
 انا ساكن في شارع 36
 ضحك فرانسيسكو بصوت عال.
 بالأمس علمت بهذا من أحد الجيران.
 كجار، لا أعرف ما الذي قد يحدث لجيراني المنزعجين.
 لذلك، فيما يتعلق بتعديل المطالبة بالملكية، أعتقد أنه يبدو غريبًا بالنسبة للمحامي أن يقول إن حوالي ستة أشهر ستمر عندما لا يكون لديه بالفعل خطة ملموسة، خطة ملموسة، خطة لمحاولة تمرير هذا التعديل.
 لذلك هذا القسم مزعج للغاية، وهو في الغالب مكان للاختباء.
 أنا قلقة على سلامتك.
 هناك إمكانية لسكان الهالوين والأطفال والمجتمعات المحلية.
 بالإضافة إلى ذلك، تعتبر مواقف السيارات والاختناقات المرورية مشكلة كبيرة في المنطقة.
 لم أسمع أي شيء عن الزوار أو زيارة القرية، ولكن من المؤكد أن هناك 40 منزلاً هناك، ومن المحتمل أن يكون هناك الكثير من حركة المرور في المنطقة.
 لذلك أعتقد أن هناك بعض الاعتبارات الإضافية هنا.
 اتضح أنه لم يتم التفكير بعناية في جميع الخطط، حتى خطط البناء والامتثال لـ ADA.
 لذلك أعتقد أن لدي الكثير من المشكلات مع أعضاء المجتمع وأعتقد أنه يجب أن يكون هناك المزيد من الأفكار والمناقشات حول هذا الأمر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=6533.656s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا جين.

 فقط شجع الناس على وضع الأمور في نصابها الصحيح.
 يعد ملجأ النساء والأطفال المتأثرين بالعنف المنزلي استخدامًا جيدًا وجديرًا حقًا لهذه المساحة في مدينتنا.
 ظاهريًا، هذا أمر يجب على الجميع قبوله.
 حياة هؤلاء الناس أكثر أهمية من مواقف السيارات.
 إنها أكثر أهمية من الأشياء الصغيرة التي تعلم أنه سيتم تناولها لاحقًا بالتأكيد.
 ولهذا السبب أدعم الملجأ وأشجع الناس على النظر إلى ما هو أبعد من ساحة انتظار السيارات والتفكير في تحسين حياتهم.

 هل فهمت المتحدثين بشكل صحيح؟
 وفقا للمقدم، سوف تقوم بتعليم القيادة التجارية لأولئك الذين لا يملكون سيارة بعد.
 سؤالي هو: هل هذه المرافق مفتوحة اليوم؟
 انسَ المستأجرين أو الطلاب: أين المعلم، أين سيوقف المعلم سيارته أو شاحنته؟
 ماذا لو استطاع المرشح أن يخبرنا كيف تتحرك الحافلة من جانب إلى آخر بسبب عدم وجود موقف للسيارات أو شيء مشابه في دراسة النقل؟
 أود أيضًا أن أعرف من قام بتقييم المدينة بناءً على دراسات حركة المرور ومواقف السيارات.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=6727.937s">[Mike O'Brien]</a>: بالطبع، عشت أنا ومايك أوبراين في أحد شوارع سينسيناتي.
 أعتقد أنني أستطيع فهم الغرض من المركز التعليمي المقترح.
 إنني أقدر أيضًا أن المبنى المجاور لم يعد فارغًا كما كان في السنوات الأخيرة.
 يمكنني أن أقدر المطور الذي يبحث عن عائد على الاستثمار.
 شراء هذا المبنى.
 لكن أعتقد أنني يجب أن أطرح بعض الأسئلة.
 حسنًا، لأكون واضحًا، أنا آسف قليلاً لهذا المعرض، لم أبدأ به بعد، لكنني أعتقد أن المطورين يمكن أن يكونوا أكثر وضوحًا وأكثر تفكيرًا.
 كانت هناك خطة في البداية، لكنها لم تكن ممكنة، والآن تتمثل الخطة البديلة في محاولة استرداد بعض الاستثمار عن طريق شراء المبنى المجاور.
 وبهذا المعنى، تبدو وكأنها خطة غير مكتملة، على الأقل مما سمعته في هذا المؤتمر.
 لذا، بالنظر إلى الموعد النهائي لمدة ستة أشهر، هل يمكنني أن أقول، ما هو الاستعجال؟ أود أن أرى هذا إذا كان يعمل بشكل أفضل من التغيير السريع هنا.
 أعلم أن هناك دراسة مرورية، لكن ليست دراسة تأثير المجتمع.
 أنت تعرف ما هي التكلفة: العقارات، وإحصاءات الجريمة.
 كانت دراسة حركة المرور رائعة، لكنني أصبحت مهتمًا أكثر فأكثر بكيفية تأثير هذه الإضافة على المجتمع بأكمله.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7104.717s">[SPEAKER_35]</a>: مرحبا إميلي.
 شكرا لك
 اسمي إميلي مالكام.
 أنا أعيش في الشارع الأول.
 كما أن زوجتي تستخدم اتفاقية التنوع البيولوجي، لكنني أتحدث من وجهة نظري الشخصية.
 وأعرب الجيران بوضوح عن مخاوفهم المشروعة.
 لقد تفاجأت قليلاً عندما سمعت قريبًا من أحد أعضاء مجلس الإدارة أن الكنيسة ستكون جارة جيدة للأشخاص الذين يعيشون في المبنى.
 أشعر أنه إذا كنا قلقين بشأن هذه القضية، فربما لا نناقشها بحسن نية.
 لكن، كما تعلمون، لقد اعتمدت على معلومات من مسيرتي المهنية كمدرس ومن تجربتي الخاصة في العمل مع الأشخاص الذين يعملون في ملاجئ العنف المنزلي.
 عندما يتم وضع الأطفال في مأوى للطلاب خارج الكافتيريا.
 السكان عمومًا مراعون جدًا ومحترمون لجيرانهم في المنطقة، وبما أن النزاع على السكن صعب للغاية، فهم بحاجة حقًا إلى التواجد هناك، وإلا فلن يكونوا هناك.
 لا أحد يريد البقاء في ملجأ للعنف المنزلي.
 وبطبيعة الحال، هناك بعض التفاصيل الهامة التي تحتاج إلى توضيح.
 أنا مهتم بما سيقوله وليد وآخرون.
 نظرًا لطبيعة هذا المطور، يبدو أنه يجب أن يكون هناك المزيد من المحادثات من منظور الشخص الأول مع الأشخاص القريبين، سواء الجيران أو البعيدين قليلاً.
 مع عدم اليقين بشأن ما يحدث في المشهد السياسي الأوسع، فإن معظمنا، خاصة اليوم وبعد القلق بشأن كيفية الاعتناء ببعضنا البعض
 نهجنا هو الاستمرار في تعزيز استخدام ورعاية مجتمعنا في المجتمعات الأخرى.
 نريد بناء مجتمع يوفر الموارد للأشخاص الضعفاء.
 نعم، يمكننا القول أننا بحاجة إلى السكن، ولكننا بحاجة إلى سماع المزيد من الحلول المبتكرة لمواقف السيارات وسلامة المشاة.
 لكني لا أحب حقيقة أننا هنا نخدم الناس بينما هم في مكان آخر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7237.289s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 10 ثواني.
 شكرا لك، إميلي.
 وأنا أقدر هذه التعليقات.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7264.452s">[SPEAKER_13]</a>: مرحبا، اسمي ماتوس داراري ماتوس.
 أعيش في 54 شارع لوغان في ميدفورد.
 أنا في سانت.
 سانت فرانسيس، لذلك لا يزال لدي عائلة هناك.
 سؤالي: في الحقيقة لدي سؤالان.
 إذن وفقًا لقانون دوفر هنا
 أعلم أن بعض الأشخاص قد ذكروا هذا فيما يتعلق بالأطفال الذين سيكونون في هذا المبنى، ولكن هل سيتم وضعهم في منازل قاموا بدمجها في نظامنا المدرسي؟
 أعلم أننا نشعر بالإحباط كما قال الكثيرون، لذا إذا كان هذا هو الموسم فلماذا لا نعيش هناك؟
 سؤالي الآخر: أعلم أن داخل هذا المبنى في خطر كامل.
 يحتوي المبنى على كميات كبيرة من الأسبستوس.
 إذن ما هي خطط التجديد والبناء؟
 أعلم أنك قلت أنه سيعمل خلال 6 أشهر.
 أعتقد أنك تعلم، من الضروري معرفة هذه المعلومات لأنها موجودة.
 مرحبا اسبست.
 حسنًا، أعني، كما تعلمون، أنني أتفق مع سكاربيلي، كما تعلمون، إنها قضية نبيلة، وهناك أماكن أخرى في ميدفورد قد تكون مناسبة.
 حسنا، ليس كل من يدعم هذه الحياة قريب.
 حسناً، كلهم ​​على الجانب الآخر من المدينة.
 أعتقد أنك تعرف، أود فقط أن أكرر أن وقوف السيارات هو بالفعل كارثة.
 وقوف السيارات صعب للغاية.
 كان لدي طفلان صغيران، وعندما عاد والدي إلى المنزل، كان يعاني من الصداع.
 لا أعتقد أن إضافة المزيد من الأشخاص إلى المجتمع الأكثر اكتظاظًا بالسكان هو المكان المناسب لهذه القضية النبيلة.
 أوركون</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7370.341s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا لك، داري.
 وأنا أقدر هذه الفكرة.
 رأيت السيناتور المشلول يرفع يده مرة أخرى.
 هل لدينا أي أفراد آخرين من الجمهور يرغبون في التعليق قبل أن يُطلب من مجلس Skelly التعليق كأعضاء في البرلمان؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7391.31s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: سيادة الرئيس، سيدتي، لدي نسخة من ما قاله لي أحد المواطنين أنه لا يستطيع التحدث بصوت عالٍ محلياً، ولكن سمح لي بقراءته وإعطاء اسمه وعنوانه للسجل.
 اسمها شاليز جولييت رويل، عنوانها هو 35 شارع كولومبيا، شارع ميدفورد.
 قالت: "أعيش في ميدفورد وأدعم بقوة ملاجئ العنف المنزلي في مجتمعنا".
 نشأت والدتي في جورجيا، وتطوعت في مركز أزمات الاغتصاب، وأحببت زيارة الأماكن التي تقدم الدعم المباشر لضحايا العنف الجنسي والعنف القائم على النوع الاجتماعي.
 سأكون فخورًا برؤية ميدفورد توفر المأوى للأفراد والأسر المتضررة من العنف المنزلي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7438.425s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرًا لك أليسيا، وأنا أقدر الضعف في تعليقاتك.
 هل هناك أي تعليقات أخرى كتبها أو قدمها الجمهور؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7450.853s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: لقد تلقينا بريدًا إلكترونيًا
 يرجى إدراج مواد الاجتماع الخاصة بكم اعتبارًا من بعد ظهر هذا اليوم.
 لا أعرف إذا كان هذا الرجل هنا الليلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7471.585s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: أعتقد أنه كان أحد السكان المحليين الذي تحدث هذا المساء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7477.128s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: وهذا هو أيضا فهمي.
 المستشار شاربيلي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7487.44s">[George Scarpelli]</a>: شكرا لك
 لا أريد أن أضيع الكثير من الوقت.
 انظر، أعلم أن أمامنا 24 ساعة صعبة، سواء كنت تريد الإلغاء أو تعارضه، خاصة في ضوء ما يحدث في جميع أنحاء البلاد.
 لقد كانت الـ 24 ساعة الماضية صعبة.
 لذا أردت فقط التأكد من أنني أوضحت بعض الأشياء التي ذكرها الرجل، إذا قلت أي شيء.
 أعني، أعتقد أن المتصل قال أنني قلت أن الكنيسة لن تكون جارة جيدة.
 أريد فقط أن أتأكد من أنني لن أقول أبدًا أنني لا أقول أبدًا ما أفكر فيه بشأن الكنيسة.
 كنت فتى اسمه سانت لويس بوي. لويس.
 لقد كان فرانسيسكو عميلاً منتظمًا طوال حياتي.
 إنهم متسامحون مع الجميع.
 لذلك أعتقد أنه ينبغي عليهم أن يكونوا جيرانًا جيدين للجميع.
 مرة أخرى، أريد فقط أن أوضح هذا.
 أنا لا أفعل هذا
 كما تعلمون، الآن هو وقت صعب لمواصلة تحمل السلبية.
 إذا فسر شخص ما ما أقوله بطريقة سلبية، أريد فقط التأكد من أنني قمت بتصحيح ذلك حتى نتمكن جميعًا من محاولة البقاء إيجابيين والمضي قدمًا.
 لذا شكرا لك، إميليا.
 شكرًا لك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7555.955s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا لك، ماربيلي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7558.018s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: سيدتي الرئيسة، وصلتني رسالة مباشرة أخرى من أولئك الذين قالوا إنهم لا يستطيعون رفع أيديهم.
 همايون مهيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7567.504s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: قد نطلب منك عدم إعطائنا الأفضلية.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7571.606s">[wPYt766Eu-g_SPEAKER_08]</a>: مرحبًا، اسمي همايون مرشد وأعيش في شارع 30.
 ضحك فرانسيسكو بصوت عال.
 بجانب الطريق التالي.
 وجهة نظري هي أنني أحب حقًا معارضة هذه المقترحات لأن من يدعمها لا يعيش في هذا المجتمع.
 نحن أنفسنا، مما يعني أننا نواجه هذا.
 وسنكون من بين الذين يعانون.
 لذلك المساحة محدودة للغاية
 مشكلة أخرى هي الضوضاء.
 فكر في الأطفال.
 لدي ثلاثة أطفال.
 أعتقد أن هناك الكثير من الأطفال الآن، إلى أين يذهبون؟
 ننسى الأماكن الأخرى.
 أعني أنهم سيضطرون للخروج في الصيف.
 المنطقة كلها ستكون في حالة من الاضطراب.
 لذلك، أعرب جميع جيراني عن آرائهم ومخاوفهم.
 أريد فقط أن أقول شيئًا واحدًا: هذا ليس المكان المناسب.
 شكرا لك
 أشكرك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7638.365s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا لك
 إذن، من يرغب في سماع رأي دانيال أو أليس؟ هل هناك أي شخص آخر في الجمهور يعلق لأول مرة؟
 مرة أخرى، إذا شجعنا أي تعليقات، فأنت تعلم أن هناك عنوان بريد إلكتروني يمكنك من خلاله مشاركة التعليقات المنشورة في الدردشة.
 ولذلك، نحن نشجعك على مشاركة ملاحظاتك من خلال عنوان البريد الإلكتروني هذا.

 شكرا لك دانييلا.
 نحن الآن نكمل فترة التعليق العام لهذا الاجتماع.
 أود أن أعطي لمقدم الطلب ردًا أو فرصة للرد على بعض التعليقات المقدمة لأنني أعلم أن هناك العديد من الاقتراحات.
 نود أن نسمع بعض الأفكار ردا على ذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7703.687s">[Mike Ross]</a>: 好的，我会尽力的。
 首先，这个团队并不是之前来这座城市提出豪华公寓的团队。
 所以我不知道那个团队是否改变了主意并说，好吧，在这种情况下，让我们做一个清醒的房子或者让我们做
 避难所或他们去的任何地方，那不是你面前的人。
 这是一位前任索赔人，他将房产卖给了我的客户。
 我的客户即将到来，这是他们的第一个提案，因此任何针对他们的敌意，过去几分钟内对他们提出的一些评论，最重要的是，不幸且不准确。
 其次，我想就有关法律问题进行辩论。
 此次电话会议的参与者。
 但我认为这不是合适的论坛。
 我要给你们读一段引言，它可能会对我喜欢的一个案例中的人们有所帮助，而且我刚刚得到了这个案例。
 毫无疑问，教导人们如何处理日常问题并在社会中生存的基本知识
 一个教育过程。
 这就是为什么清醒的住宅在这里是合法用途的原因。
 看，我住在一个社区里。
 很久以前，我是一名议员。
 我们都生活在社区中。
 我们理解人们对周围环境的担忧。
 我们明白这一点。
 因此，这群人刻意去挨家挨户交谈。
 我很欣赏玛吉所说的。
 玛吉说她想更好地了解她的邻居。
 她希望这群人能够更好地了解他。
 这个小组同意。
 该小组希望更好地了解这个社区。
 我认为人们会发现英语中最危险的词是they。
 他们。
 当人们会发现什么
 她深入探讨了家庭暴力的话题，同时也分享了自己的经历，我们很感激就是这样。
 与此相关的人以及家人和朋友，他们将居住在该房产中。
 任何地方都没有这样的房产，因为人们不希望在他们的后院有一个无家可归者收容所。
 在这次会议之前，有人在不同的房屋上投下传单，并说请出现，以防止无家可归者收容所来到您的社区。
 现在我明白了，人们看到这个，他们很生气，他们认为有人试图对他们施加一些影响并破坏他们的社区。
 我的客户敲门、与邻居交谈并询问他们是否愿意，而不是因为我们需要停车位。
 因为人们认为我们需要停车位。
 你听说过最近成立了这家公司与我们合作的专业人士，这就是为什么这个实体在国务卿办公室里很新鲜，而不是因为我们制定了一些精心设计的计划来以某种方式欺骗这个电话的参与者
 以某种方式让新人进入这个空间，试图告诉他们，我们想假装我们想要建立一个家庭暴力庇护所，这样我们就可以转身并以某种方式穿过我们实际上正在尝试建造的梅德福市，什么，一个无家可归者收容所或建造豪华住房，但我们假装进来
 所以不，这里的情况并非如此。
 它拥有经验丰富的专业人士，他们从事这项工作数十年，从事这项工作数十年。
 Taisha 在这里为这个项目创建了一个实体 Halo House，作为服务这个社区的非营利实体。
 业主安德鲁·利奇菲尔德和史蒂夫·苏达
 其他类型此类住房的业主，以开发商的身份，自己拥有该房产，因此不会有与之相关的免税，即使租赁该空间的租户是非营利组织。
 这里的目标是
 改善这些人的生活，他们在许多情况下是生活在同一社区的人。
 让我尝试回答一些具体问题。
 我提到了财产税，它们将被支付。
 有人说我们隐藏了房间数量，原来是 40 间，现在是 37 间。
 正如我所说，共有 37 个房间和 3 个灵活房间，总共 40 个房间。
 这三个灵活的房间可以用作办公室。
 它们可以用作临时设施。
 它们可以用作灵活的安装空间。
 所以一共有40个房间。
 那个房间里会有多少人？
 好吧，如果你有一个母亲和一个婴儿，那就是两个人在同一个房间里。
 如果你有一个母亲，还有一个儿子，就像我之前说过的，如果那个儿子七八岁，那么这个儿子就会住在隔壁房间，他们之间会有一扇门。
 建筑物的全部容量是我们的建筑师和您的施工部门之间解决的过程。
 您的建筑部门根据我们的建筑师向您的建筑部门提供的建筑级别文件提供了法律允许的数量。
 建筑无障碍吗？
 当然是。
 我们必须遵守无障碍指南。
 我不知道，这是一项耗资超过百万美元的翻新工程，触发了一定程度的无障碍指南。
 我们的建筑师完全理解并理解了这一点。
 您所在大楼的员工都明白这一点。
 这有不同的层次。
 这座建筑将被彻底夷为平地。
 这些洒水装置将为消防员创建某种专业分类，而该建筑中目前尚不存在这种分类。
 无论这里是否需要电梯，如果由于某种残疾人通道、某些 AAA 要求、某些无障碍要求而需要电梯，那么我们就会在那里安装电梯。
 但我们的理解，我们的建筑师埃里克·扎切森（Eric Zacherson）非常好，他在马萨诸塞州做了很多工作，包括在波士顿市，
 他认为我们这个空间不需要电梯。
 否则我们就会穿上它们。
 我们建议通过在底层创建无障碍单元并进入底层的这些区域来实现无障碍指南。
 消防路线、与火灾有关的其他问题、灭火系统、改进我们的系统。
 所有这些事情都不是我们提议的。
 这些是马萨诸塞州建筑规范和消防规范提出并由您的建筑部门强制执行的内容。
 当然，我们必须遵守所有这些规定。
 但我认为这个问题的核心是使用问题。
 当我的客户敲开一些邻居的门说：看，你们有这个空包裹吗？
 你愿意租吗？
 这是一个公平的问题。
 这次会议他们问我们，他们在这次会议上告诉我们，这都是交通问题，这都是停车和交通问题，尽管我们告诉他们，根据我们的专业经验，我们的客户没有车，也没有带车。
 但我们看到了拥有三四个空间的价值。
 如果有的话那就太好了。
 我们这个包里没有这个。
 牧师或修女的包裹里没有这个。
 是的，他们没有开车去某个地方，但他们有人来帮助他们在设施周围做事。
 拥有它就太好了。
 我们得到的答案是，如果我们同意建造豪华公寓，我们就会获得停车位。
 如果我们要建造豪华公寓，那么是的，可以达成协议来创建停车位，并将这些停车位用于该设施。
 但人们不希望他们附近有无家可归者收容所。
 这就是问题所在。
 这就是我们所听到的。
 我认为很容易说这是一个无家可归者收容所，并用它来污蔑这里提出的建议。
 这正是
 这就是为什么我们制定《多佛修正案》等法律来防止此类使用，因为使用通常会带来偏见。
 孩子们会上学还是必须上学？
 在家里要有礼貌。
 孩子们将有机会进入学校系统。
 如果孩子想要，如果父母想要在家教育他们，那些父母对吗？
 当然是。
 这个社区有公园。
 希基公园是附近的一个公园。
 这是这些孩子最有可能去的地方并受到适当的监督。
 事实上，由于该设施拥有的资源，在许多情况下，他们将受到更好的监督，而不是在住房不足或养育不足的情况下。
 他们是美国人还是非法的？
 这个国家现在的需要是为受虐待的妇女及其子女提供资源。
 我怀疑这种需求是全球性的需求。
 我会让露丝和塔夏莎完成这个问题，回答这个问题。
 没有人会被赶下公交车。
 如果市政府不希望我们在圣路易斯提供人行道
 克莱尔，我们不会在圣克莱尔街提供人行道。
 克拉拉。
 该公寓没有在圣路易斯提供人行道。
 克拉拉。
 所以我认为这种家庭暴力
 呃，资源，你知道你不想投资比你需要的更多的钱，也不应该投资，不要在圣路易斯建造人行道是可以的。
 克莱尔，如果这是城市希望我们做的，我们会遵守城市要求我们做的一切，他们希望我们做消防车道，所以那里可以有消防车道，也有一定的要求，我们并不是建议我们取消。
 防火罩或消防栓，当然我们会完全遵守所有这些要求。
 我认为这涵盖了
 尤其是异地工作。
 没有人会尝试在圣路易斯进行商业驾驶。
 克莱尔和其他小巷。
 在许多这样的工作目的地，太阳能电池板，以及其他类似的东西，这就是我们拥有渡轮的原因。
 人们将登上渡轮并被带到这些资源。
 并非所有资源都能到达我们手中。
 很多很多。
 但像这样的事情
 您将不会学习在该社区附近的街道上驾驶商用车辆。
 它们将在我们派遣人员的异地设施中完成。
 我想，Tay，你应该把这段对话放在聊天评论中。
 最后，如果可以的话，让我把它交给露丝，或者交给塔夏莎来回应，因为这是你一生的工作。
 他们告诉你，你只是认为这是一个骗局。
 我很抱歉不得不听到这个消息。
 我认为你有权得到答案。</p>

 أنا أعرف حقا ما أواجهه.
 وقاموا بحماية مئات الأشخاص.
 سبب عدم جني تلك الأرباح هو أنها جاءت من قلبي.
 لقد عملت مع العديد من الأشخاص وواجهت هذه المواقف ومن الأفضل دائمًا أن نوفر لهم مأوى لإدارة بيئتهم وإعلام الجيران بأننا هنا ونهتم بهم.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8886.446s">[Mike Ross]</a>: حسناً، سيدي الرئيس، أريد أن أتوقف عند هذا الحد.
 أعتقد أننا جلبنا لك الأفضل.
 شخص ما رفع الباب.
 ليس هناك باب يؤدي إلى ثروة أحد.
 هذا لن يحدث.
 وينبغي التعامل مع مادة الأسبستوس، في حال وجودها، بطريقة احترافية.
 أندرو ليتشفيلد، ستيف سويدا، هذا ما فعلوه.
 إنهم يعملون في العقارات.
 واجهوا المباني المتضررة.
 هذا ما يفعلونه.
 هناك عملية لحل هذه المشكلة.
 وسيعمل بشكل جيد مع إدارة بناء ميدفورد، ووكالة الصحة العامة المناسبة، وما إلى ذلك.
 سيدتي الرئيسة، سيدتي، أريد أن أتوقف هنا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8925.414s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا مايكل روث وتاسا.
 وأنا أقدر إجابتك.
 سأكشف ذلك لرئيس الصيادين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8934.942s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: شكرا لك، الرئيس لوك تشومتيو.
 في الواقع، أريد فقط مشاركة المزيد من المعلومات مع هذا المنتدى.
 ولا يعتبره الناس جزءًا من تفكيرهم.
 أريد حقًا مشاركة هذه القصة مع الجمهور.
 من المشاكل التي أتمنى حلها هي الدراسة والمواصلات والمصاريف.
 لذلك اتصلت بمدير التسجيل والتسليم لدينا.
 كما أنه ينقل المشردين في النظام المدرسي.
 وقال إن ميدفورد في حاجة ماسة إلى مأوى.
 وهو يعلم أن هناك عائلات في ميدفورد تستمتع بركوب القوارب، لكنها لا تفعل ذلك في المناطق المزدحمة.
 إذا لم يكن الطفل في خطر، فلا يوجد واجب الإبلاغ عن القانون.
 لكن بعض الناس يستفيدون بشكل كبير من وجود مساحة أكبر وعدم وجود عائلتين أو ثلاث عائلات تعيش معًا.
 لذلك سألته كيف سيؤثر ذلك على المدرسة.
 وقال إنه إذا كان هناك أطفال بلا مأوى في مدرسة بلا مأوى، فيجب على الآباء معالجة المشكلة.
 إذا كانوا يريدون أن يذهب أطفالهم إلى المدرسة، فإن النظام المدرسي يقع في المنطقة التي يعيشون فيها أو ينتقلون إليها.
 إذا كنت تعيش في العراق وتنتقل، فيمكن للوالدين التقدم بطلب للحصول على مكان في ميدفورد أو إيفريت.
 لذا، إذا كانت هناك وسائل نقل، وإذا انتهى بهم الأمر إلى الذهاب إلى ميدفورد، فسوف أكون طالبًا منتظمًا مثل أي شخص آخر لديه وسائل نقل منتظمة.
 إذا كان الأمر كذلك، فذلك لأنه يجب إعادتهم إلى مكان ما.
 الطريقة التي يتم بها الأمر اليوم هي أن كلا المجتمعين يتقاسمان تكلفة نقل هؤلاء الطلاب (عادةً بالشاحنات)، والتي تحددها الولاية بنسبة 80 بالمائة من التكلفة.
 آسف، لقد أعطتني دقة الهواء أو شيء من هذا القبيل، لكنهم دفعوا لنا 80% من تكلفة الشحن.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9048.231s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: لقد أرسلت للتو هذه الرسالة عبر الرسالة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9051.56s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: أوه عظيم، شكرا.
 قانون ماكيني تونتو لمساعدة المشردين.
 أعتقد أنه يجب أن يحصل الناس على هذه المعلومات، حتى لو لم تكن جزءًا مما يدرسه المجلس الليلة، لأنني أعتقد أن هناك الكثير من الالتباس أو المعلومات الخاطئة حولها.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9068.274s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا لك، أليسيا.
 أعتقد أن المجلس لديه الكثير ليفكر فيه.
 لذلك أعتقد أن الهالوين يمكن أن يكون جارًا جيدًا.
 أعتقد أن جميع المواطنين الذين يشاركون في هذه الدعوة يريدون أيضًا أن يكونوا جيرانًا طيبين.
 ولكن كما أفهمها، هناك العديد من المتغيرات.
 كما تعلمون، يجب معالجة هذه المشكلة بما يتجاوز فهم بعض المجتمعات بما يتجاوز الحاجة إلى مواقف السيارات، والتي يبدو أنها نشاط أساسي.
 وأود أن أواصل هذه المناقشة لبعض الوقت، ولكن أود أيضا أن أتركها مفتوحة للنظر فيها من قبل المجلس.
 نحن نعتبر سؤالين: هل يشكل هذا استخدامًا تعليميًا محميًا بموجب تعديل الامتياز؟
 إذن ما هي الأحكام المعقولة التي ينبغي تطبيقها على المشروع؟
 هل يجب أن ينطبق الاستثناء المقترح على متطلبات مواقف السيارات ومعايير الحجم الأخرى؟
 ما هي شروط الموافقة اللازمة للتخفيف من الآثار السلبية للاستثناء المقترح؟
 وبعد ذلك سأضعه على السبورة.
 النقاش والنقاش.
 إقرأ، علي، آدم، بطرس.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9162.218s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: اعتقدت بشدة أن هذا قد يكون خطيرًا جدًا
 أعتقد أننا فعلنا ذلك.
 وأنا أتفق مع النقطة المثيرة للاهتمام التي ذكرتها إميلي للتو.
 أعتقد أن هناك حالات جيدة يمكن أن تفيد مجتمعنا.
 لقد سمعت أيضًا بوضوح أن هناك الكثير من القلق بشأن تفاصيل التنفيذ.
 أعتقد
 وهذا هو دور مثل هذا المجلس: خلق الفرص وتشجيع التعاون بين المرشحين والمجتمع للقيام بأشياء تعود بالنفع على الجميع.
 لذلك فمن المنطقي بالنسبة لي أن أحفظ هذا الرابط لفهم بعض التفاصيل.
 لقد قمت بتشغيلها أيضًا، لكن لم أتمكن من قراءتها لأنني كنت أستمع إلى هذه الأغنية.
 في هذه المناقشة
 يبدو الأمر كما لو أنني أحاول إجراء بحثي الخاص حول تعديلات الفائز بالجائزة.
 أنا لست محامياً، لكني أمين مكتبة بحثية.
 ما تعلمناه حتى الآن يبدو صحيحًا، ولكن أعتقد أن إحدى فوائد هذه النتيجة هي أنه يمكننا تأكيدها بمزيد من البحث.
 لا، أعتقد ذلك، لا أريد التخلي عن هذا المشروع، لكن من الواضح أن هناك الكثير من المناقشات الجارية حول كيفية القيام بذلك.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9255.971s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: شكرا علي.
 وأنا أتفق تماما مع علي.
 أعتقد أن هذا مشروع مهم ولا ينبغي أن يستمر، حتى نتمكن من مناقشة بعض جوانب المشروع بمزيد من التفصيل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9276.203s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: رجل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9277.624s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: حسنًا، على الأقل لم أنزل إلى الطابق السفلي دون أن أشرح نفسي أولاً.
 أعتقد أن هذه كانت نقطة مايكل روز.
 كما تعلمون، فإن الغرض من التعديلات، مثل تعديلات القذافي، هو أن هذه الأشياء جزء من المجتمع وسيكون أمامها وقت طويل للمقاومة.
 لكنني أعتقد أيضًا أن مخاوف المجتمع في محلها.
 وبمرور الوقت، سيخلق هذا النهج شعورًا أفضل بالثقة بينهما.
 على الرغم من أنني لست محاميًا، أعتقد أنه بناءً على السوابق القضائية السابقة، يجب علينا تكثيف السوابق القضائية لدينا لضمان أن هذا التباين يقع ضمن نطاق اختصاص دوفر.
 من خلال بحثي الخاص حول هذه المسألة وبالنظر فقط إلى التعليم السابق والحالات الخطيرة، يبدو أن هذا قد يندرج تحت تعديل دوفر.
 ولكن إذا فشل كل شيء آخر، احصل على أفكار من الآخرين.
 لا نريد اتخاذ قرارات عندما نكون متعبين.
 كيف نشعر؟
 وأعتقد أن الجزء الآخر هو رؤية المجتمع والثقة التي اكتسبتها في مدن مختلفة، بالقرب من المشاريع أو الأماكن.
 لم يكن لدي أي شيء سوى تجارب إيجابية معهم.
 أعتقد أنهم يلعبون دورًا مهمًا.
 أعتقد أنني مثل الناس هنا، أتحدث عن أفراد مجتمعنا الذين غالبًا ما يمرون بأوقات عصيبة.
 كما تعلمون، آخر شيء تعلمونه، لا أعتقد أنني كعضو في مجلس المدينة مستعد للحديث عن جميع القضايا الإستراتيجية المطروحة الآن فيما يتعلق بمواقف السيارات والامتيازات.
 كيف يتم ذلك؟
 أعتقد أنه سيكون من المفيد الحصول على أمثلة محددة لمشاريع مماثلة، حسنًا، أكثر تحديدًا قليلًا، مثل بيانات حركة المرور المتوقعة.
 مرة أخرى، في جهودي فكرت في الثقة ببعضنا البعض.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9454.315s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: يبدو أن بيتر متصل بالإنترنت أيضًا.
 هذا هو اي فون.
 سأحاول الاتصال به وأطلب منه إيقاف الصوت.

 لذلك أنا... حسنًا، على ما أعتقد
 على الأقل تمت الإجابة على السؤال الذي طرحته هذا المساء حول الواجب واللياقة البدنية.
 أعتقد أن ما يحدث الآن يضاعف مخاوف الأعضاء الآخرين.
 هذا هو الحال</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9568.701s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: ثم</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9571.171s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: أيها السيدات والسادة، هل من المناسب أن يقترح أحد أعضاء المجلس إجراء انتخابات أو التصويت لصالح هذا الاجتماع؟
 أفكار صغيرة، نحتاج إلى تحديد موعد مسبقاً.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9582.745s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: حسنًا
 لكي نكون واضحين، نحتاج إلى الانتقال إلى تاريخ ووقت محددين.
 لذلك أنصحك بالتفاوض مع المرشحين حتى يتمكن الجميع من المشاركة.
 أعتقد أنه سيكون من المفيد أن نتمكن من إدراج ما نريد رؤيته بعد ذلك.
 حسنًا
 أستطيع أن أقول إن رأينا حول حركة المرور يعتمد على حقيقة أنها خاصة.
 أعتقد أننا بحاجة إلى معرفة كيفية تنسيق معلومات الدولة التي يمتلكها بيتر.
 نحن ندعوك للاتصال بنا دون الاتصال بالإنترنت من خلال المعلومات المحلية لوزارة النقل والهندسة.
 لأنه يؤثر على ما يمكننا القيام به وما يجب أن نطالب به، سواء في العلن أو في القطاع الخاص.
 أنا آسف لأننا لم نتمكن من الحضور الليلة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9639.797s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: لذلك ربما يمكننا تلخيص المعلومات التي نريد الاستمرار فيها حتى يتمكن مقدمو الطلب من فهم النطاق.
 ثم يمكننا مناقشة التواريخ.
 لذلك أعتقد أننا مازلنا نناقش هذا الأمر في البرلمان.
 دانيال، هل يجب أن نفتح مستندًا نصيًا لبدء كتابة الموضوع؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9667.145s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: لقد فقدت القطار.
 أنا متعب جدا.
 أريد أن أقول أنه بغض النظر عما يحدث، إذا كنا نبحث عن حل لمشكلة الرصيف، فسوف أفعل ذلك
 كما تعلمون، تم الانتهاء من هذه الخطة لأنها معقدة للغاية من حيث متطلبات الخطة، لأنها سهلة التفسير وصعبة التنفيذ.
 ولذلك أود أن أضيف أن الاجتماع المقبل سيكون حافلا بالأحداث.
 كان علينا أن نأخذ في الاعتبار الخطط والتغييرات المعقدة في أراضي المدينة الغامضة الغامضة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9711.718s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: متى سيتم هذا اللقاء؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9713.841s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: إنه اليوم 20 ويمكننا أن نلتقي لاحقًا.</p>

 كل شيء على ما يرام.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9728.436s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: أعتقد أنه سيكون الرابع من ديسمبر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9731.722s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: يجب على المرشحين تأكيد توافرهم.
 أعتقد أيضًا أنه سيكون من الجيد الحصول على المعلومات التي يحتاجونها في الاجتماع التالي حتى يفهموا وتعرف أنه جبل، أليس كذلك؟
 هل هذه حبة رمل؟
 كم من الوقت يستغرقون؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9748.215s">[Mike Ross]</a>: ولذلك، يسر فريقنا أن يحضر الاجتماع يوم 4 ديسمبر، وهو يوم آمن.
 كل ما نريد فعله هو جمع الجميع معًا والتوصل إلى قائمة يمكننا إنشاؤها.
 أنا أستمتع بالعمل مع الفرق وأطلب المساعدة من مجلس الإدارة.
 يعتمد نوع منتج العمل الذي نقوم بإنشائه على البيانات المقدمة اليوم.
 أعتقد أنهم قدموا عروضاً معقولة.
 أعتقد أنهم قدموا بعض التعليقات غير المرغوب فيها.
 أعتقد أننا بحاجة إلى أن نكون صادقين بشأن هذا.
 لذلك أريد التأكد من أن ما نطلب منك القيام به يتوافق مع حقوقنا كمتقدمين خاصين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9800.916s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: نعم، لدينا تفويض واضح لهذه اللجنة.
 بعض المشاريع تقع ضمن اختصاصنا والبعض الآخر لا.
 ولهذا السبب من الأفضل البقاء ضمن هذه الحدود.
 هذا هو حقك كمرشح.
 لذلك، سنعمل في هذا الدور كمستشارك ومرشحك ومواطن ميدفورد.
 باعتبارها لجنة التخطيط.
 لدي سؤال فقط.
 هل يمكننا إرسال أسئلة إضافية عبر البريد الإلكتروني؟
 نعم، يرجى إرسال أي أسئلة، أي تعليقات.
 نحن نرحب بكم ونشجعكم ونشكركم على حضوركم ومشاركة تجاربكم في هذا المشروع.
 شكرا لك، أليسيا.
 آسف بيتر، فقط استمر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9851.124s">[Peter Calves]</a>: نعم فعلت ذلك للمرة الثالثة.
 هذه هي مسؤولياته.
 لدي قائمة الطلبات.
 قال دانيال شيئًا عن استكمال خطة المشروع ونريد أن نؤكد أن سانت.
 يمكن أن تؤثر هذه المجموعة والتأثير على حركة المرور.
 هل هناك أي ظروف أخرى تود الظروف الأخرى رؤيتها في الأيام القليلة القادمة؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9893.753s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: وبالمثل، قد تتناول سياساتنا متطلبات مواقف السيارات ومعاييرها وأحجامها والتصاريح اللازمة للتخفيف من التأثير السلبي لطلب التنازل.
 وهذا يلتقط معظمه.
 أنا أشجع العملاء على النظر خارج نطاق هذا المنتدى إلى بعض المحتويات، خاصة إذا كانت هناك صور أو خرائط أو محتوى آخر يوفر معلومات إضافية من شأنها أن تساعد المشاهدين على فهم إجاباتك على هذه الأسئلة.
 أعتقد أنه إذا تم تنفيذه، فسيكون مفيدًا جدًا لعلاقات الجوار المستقبلية.
 لقد تم طرح سؤال علي في الدردشة وهذا كل شيء
 إذا كان اجتماع 4 ديسمبر مخصصًا أيضًا للعامة والمقيمين، فقد يتعين عليه الذهاب إلى قاعة المدينة أو قد يكون ضمن اختصاص مجلس المدينة.
 الاجتماعات مفتوحة دائمًا للمجتمع والمقيمين، لكنني أفهم أنه قد تكون هناك رغبة في التعليق بشكل أكبر على هذه القضية.
 هل هذه مشكلة؟
 نعم حسنا.
 هل يمكننا الحصول على فترة تعليق عام أخرى؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9975.735s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Lok Chumteav هو الرئيس الرئيسي لموضوع كبير جدًا، خاصة إذا قلت أنك تريد قصر الرأي العام على مواضيع لم تتم مناقشتها في هذا الاجتماع.
 لذا، إذا نشروا معلومات جديدة، شيئًا جديدًا، فقد يعلق الجمهور، لكنهم لن يعلقوا.
 ولهذا السبب استمع المجلس إلى تعليقات مثل تلك التي تم الإدلاء بها الليلة. يجب أن تقتصر التعليقات على المعلومات الحالية. أعتقد أنه إذا شعر الناس أنهم لا يستطيعون التحدث الليلة، فيمكن التعامل مع الأمر. لكنهم يريدون تكرار ما يحدث هنا. اكتب إلينا وسيخبرك المجلس إذا كان هناك أشخاص متشابهون في التفكير.
 نعم، لكننا لا نسمع 10 أشخاص يقولون نفس الشيء مرارًا وتكرارًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10032.739s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: لأكون واضحًا، من المفيد جدًا سماع التعليقات العاطفية من الجمهور الليلة.
 لذلك، نود حقًا الاستماع إلى آرائهم ومعارفهم وخبراتهم ومشاركتها، كما يشارك المرشحون رؤيتهم لهذا الموقع.
 لذا نعم
 نعم نعم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10060.842s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: سؤال آخر.
 لدينا إلغاء أعتقد أنه يغطي ما قالته الحكومة وبيتر.
 أعتقد أن هناك رأي عام وهذا تعليق صحيح.
 من الجيد أن يكون لديك رأي محامٍ، لكن أعتقد أنه كعضو في مجلس الإدارة من الأفضل مراجعة، على سبيل المثال، قضايا المحكمة أو المستندات وتقييم استقلاليتها من أجل الاتفاق مع رأي المحامي.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10099.908s">[SPEAKER_39]</a>: إذا لم يكن لدينا السجل، أود أن أقول إنك تقولين، سيدتي، آسف لإزعاجك، لكنك تعلمين أننا قدمنا ​​التماسًا من 24 صفحة، وهو الدليل الذي أرسلناه إلى مجلس الإدارة. لقد فشلت حقًا في الاختبار، آسف، لكن ربما سأنتبه.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10128.928s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: وفي اجتماع ديسمبر، يجب على مجلس الإدارة مراجعة المستندات السطحية بعناية.
 أنا آسف يا مايكل.
 لم أشاهد معرضًا محددًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10143.399s">[Mike Ross]</a>: ويحتوي أيضًا على تسع صفحات من تقرير بوسطن أورين.
 وكما أشار أحد الأشخاص، فهذه ليست مجرد مشكلة صغيرة.
 لذلك هناك ما يكفي من المواد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10154.608s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شكرا لك
 لقد رأيت للتو تعليقًا آخر حول المدة التي استغرقتها مراجعة المستند.
 نحن نلتزم بالمتطلبات القانونية للاجتماعات المفتوحة، لذلك أنا واثق من أن جميع إشعارات الاجتماع سيتم إرسالها قبل 48 ساعة من الاجتماع.
 ثم سوف نقوم بمشاركة الرابط
 دعونا نرى ما إذا كان بإمكاني إزالته.
 رابط للحصول على معلومات حول المرشح.
 ثم أستطيع إعادته.
 حسنًا، لم أفعل، لأنني ذهبت ورجعت.
 أليسيا، هل يمكنك العثور على هذا الرابط؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10203.573s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 لدى الرئيس لوك تشومتيو نقطتان.
 أولاً، إذا كان الأمر كذلك، فيمكنني أن أطلب من محامينا تقديم رأي رسمي مكتوب.
 كما في هذه الحالة، كما هو الحال في حقيقة أنه قابل للتبديل.
 شيء آخر هو أن المالكين Leach Litchfield وSteve Suda يريدون مشاركة معلومات الاتصال الخاصة بهم مع الجمهور لأنهم عندما يطرقون الأبواب، يقولون إن الكثير من الناس لا يجيبون.
 لذا سأترك هذا للمناقشة هنا.
 لكن في الواقع، إذا أرادوا ذلك، فسأضع ملفًا نصيًا صغيرًا يحتوي على الملف الشخصي العام للمالك ومعلومات الاتصال به، وإذا أرادوا ذلك، فسنفعل نفس الشيء حتى يتمكن الأشخاص من الاتصال بهم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10253.875s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: نعم، أطلب عرضًا تقديميًا وأرغب في الاستماع مباشرة إلى الجمهور.
 أنا أشجعك على مشاركة أي اقتراحات أو تطورات مع الموظفين ومجلس المدينة.
 حسنًا، عظيم.
 شكرًا لك أليسيا على السماح لنا بالقيام بذلك.
 لدي سؤال آخر.
 هل سيكون الاجتماع القادم في 4 ديسمبر؟
 هذا هو التاريخ الذي نوصيك بالمتابعة منه.
 نحن بحاجة لتقديم التماس رسمي.
 ويترتب على ذلك أن مقدم الطلب راضٍ بهذا التاريخ.
 عندما رأى ذلك، أطلق عليها لقبًا.
 آني، هل لديك أي تعليقات؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10298.307s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: لا، أريد أن أقوم بهذه الخطوة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10301.77s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: تلك القابضة</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10304.138s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: أقترح مواصلة مناقشة هذا الموضوع المهم في الرابع من ديسمبر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10314.206s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: هل لدينا ثانية؟
 سأكون الثاني.
 شكرا بيدرو.
 إذن هذه الحركة أمام أعيننا تعني أن الوثيقة مستمرة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10333.204s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: دعونا نتحدث عن منزل فارغ؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10337.045s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: مواصلة المناقشة في شارع 21st 21st.
 تقوم شركة Clare Street, Dow بمراجعة خطة المراجعة الخاصة بها للاستخدام غير التمييزي للخطط بحلول الرابع من ديسمبر.
 دعونا نشارك.
 جاكي ماكفيرسون؟
 عميل بيدرو؟
 هذا صحيح.
 آري بيكسمان.
 هذا صحيح.

 آدم، آدم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10373.074s">[Peter Calves]</a>: حظ سعيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10374.256s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: اقرأها بصوت عالٍ.
 هذا صحيح.
 بن لافيل.
 هذا صحيح.
 أنا إميلي فوردمان، مناصرة الاستمرارية.
 أرى المزيد والمزيد من التعليقات في الدردشة.
 أنا أشجع الجمهور على نشر هذه التعليقات على موقع توك أو مشاركتها مباشرة مع العملاء.
 لقد قدموا عرضا سخيا.
 لذلك، أشجع الجمهور على اتباع كلا النهجين.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10409.103s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: آسف إيميلي، فقط بحاجة للتوضيح.
 أعتقد أنني بحثت في Google Drive الذي شاركته أليس، ولكن لم أتمكن من العثور على الملف الذي ذكره مايكل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10431.38s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: لماذا لا نستطيع معالجة هذا المحتوى؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10438.075s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: حسنًا، أريد فقط لفت الانتباه إلى هذا لأنه يبدو أنه شيء يثير اهتمام الجمهور.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10442.436s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: هذا صحيح.
 هذا صحيح.
 نعم، من المفيد توضيح ذلك.
 شكرا على الاشارة.
 حسنًا، سنرى هذا المرشح مرة أخرى في شارع 21 ستريت كلير في الرابع من ديسمبر.
 ونود أن نشكر جميع أفراد الجمهور الذين شاركوا في جلسة الاستماع العامة.
 وهذا يعني الكثير.
 هذه طريقة رائعة للمشاركة محليًا.
 شكرًا لك.
 نأتي إلى البند التالي من جدول الأعمال - بيان المحضر.
 دعونا نواصل هذه المناقشة المثيرة للاهتمام.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10476.012s">[Richard Raso]</a>: شكرا للجميع.</p>

 ولذلك أود أن أطلب من الأعضاء إبداء آرائهم وآرائهم بشأن التعديلات على مشروع محضر الاجتماع بتاريخ 9 أكتوبر 2024؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10492.148s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: أنا لا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10492.688s">[Unidentified]</a>: مُطْلَقاً.</p>

 وعليه فإن اقتراحنا هو الموافقة على محضر اجتماع مجلس الإدارة المنعقد بتاريخ 9 أكتوبر 2024.
 دعونا نشارك.
 سأفعل ذلك من خلال مشاهدة الجميع على الشاشة.
 اقرأها بصوت عالٍ.
 معترف بها رسميا.
 آدم، آدم.
 نعم، طلب بطرس موافقة الصيادين، وتمت الموافقة عليهم، وتغيب بقية المجموعة، فهل يستحق البحث عن أسمائهم؟ لا، حسنًا، عظيم، شكرًا. التالي على جدول أعمالنا هو الابتكار الإقليمي. هل هناك أي أخبار في هذا المجال يود فريق التخطيط مشاركتها معنا؟
 كانت الساعة 10 مساءً تقريبًا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10553.95s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: لقد سئمت تقريبًا من القيام بذلك.
 ومن المقرر أن تعقد جلسات الاستماع العامة في 20 نوفمبر/تشرين الثاني.
 إذا كنت ترغب في التحقق من أي من هذا معي، سأكون سعيدًا للقيام بذلك.
 ونحن نتطلع أيضًا إلى الجهود المبذولة لتسريع عملية التطوير على طريق سالم في ديسمبر.
 لذلك أعتقد أن كل هذه ليست معلوماتك.
 سترى أن هناك سطرًا واحدًا فقط يجب أن يحتوي على ملاحظة خضراء.
 نحن ندرس تفاصيل الأوراق الخضراء مع مستشارينا.
 لذلك سيحدث هذا لاحقًا، ولكن أيضًا قريبًا جدًا، في ديسمبر.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10594.675s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: مجرد طريق غامض، أليس كذلك، أليسيا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10597.996s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: هذا هو إعادة إنشاء المسار الغامض الكامل. ويتضمن أيضًا تعريفات لم نستخدمها سابقًا كأقسام.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10605.339s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: هل تريد مني أن أرسل لك الرابط؟ في ملف الخريطة الموجود على القرص المضغوط يمكنك العثور على لغات وخرائط المناطق الساحلية الغامضة الجديدة.
 ومحاضر جلسات الاستماع العامة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10624.951s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: لم يكن آدم هو Google Drive الذي شاركه مع الجمهور، بل كان Google Drive الموجود في البريد الإلكتروني لدانيال.
 نعم.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10636.535s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: هذا هو المكان الذي ذهبت إليه، وما أرسله دانيال وما...</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10645.236s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: هناك سجلات عامة، وهناك بعض الأشياء التي قمت بإحالتها إلى مجلس الإدارة، مثل الطلبات الأولية، والتوظيف، والمشكلات غير المتعلقة بالتطبيق.
 لذا، للتحضير للاجتماع، ألقِ نظرة على الكتيب الذي أرسلته.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10665.054s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: ولكن أوه، أنا لم خلق هذا.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10671.275s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: لم أقم بإنشاء مجلد للاجتماع التالي بعد.
 لذا، هذا نداء من مكتب رئيس البلدية إلى الجمهور، لأن هذا البيان صدر اليوم، لذا يجب إثبات كل شيء.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10686.139s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: خاص.
 هل هناك أي أعمال أخرى؟
 لدي سؤال آخر.
 هل سنفرج عن السجلات عندما تخرج؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10704.581s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: يتم بث هذا مباشرة على شاشة التلفزيون.
 حسنًا
 لذلك، يستغرق الأمر بعض الوقت قبل الظهور على موقع MCM الإلكتروني.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10713.786s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: حسنًا
 بواسطة ومع وسائل الإعلام المجتمعية ميدفورد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10720.269s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: ,أ, إنه medfordtv.org.
 تلك القابضة</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10724.248s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: نعم، شكرا لك، أليسيا.
 لذا، إذا لم يكن هناك شيء للمناقشة، هل يمكننا وضعه جانبًا؟
 أقترح إنهاء الاجتماع.
 أنا الشخص الثاني.
 شكرا لك
 أفعل ما أراه على الشاشة.
 ولذلك، توصيتنا الفورية هي إعادة جدولة الاجتماع إلى 6 نوفمبر.
 ستكون هذه انتخابات استئناف.
 هل آن قوية؟
 هذا صحيح.
 آدم، ماذا؟</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10753.655s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: حظ سعيد.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10754.893s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: شرطة بيدرو.
 1. هل أنت سمكة؟
 أنا: أنا، لي، لدي رجل، ولدي أنا، وأعلم أنه ربما لست الشخص الذي يضيع هذه اللحظة.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10769.677s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: لم يفعل.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10770.657s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: أنا لا.
 أنا أيضاً. حسنًا، سأموت من أجل هذا.
 يمكننا أن نناقش الآن.
 لدينا ذلك.
 هذا صحيح.
 نعم شكرا لأعضاء مجلس الإدارة.
 شكرا لجميع سكان ومسؤولي المدينة.
 لقد كان هذا اجتماعًا ثاقبًا للغاية وأشكركم جميعًا على طاقتكم وجهودكم هذا المساء.
 أتمنى أن تنام جيدًا وتعتني بنفسك.
 صباح الخير</p>
