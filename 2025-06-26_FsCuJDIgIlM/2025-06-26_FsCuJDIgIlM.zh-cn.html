 丹妮尔，您能给我们介绍一下通话中的工作人员吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=127.214s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: 是的，今晚我们出席的有我本人、规划、发展和可持续发展办公室高级规划师 Danielle Evans，以及规划、发展和可持续发展总监 Alicia Hunt。
 我认为今晚这对球队来说已经足够了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=143.642s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 太好了，谢谢。
 现在，在我们讨论第一个议程项目之前，我想承认我们的社区发展委员会和规划委员会本质上并不具有政治性。
 但考虑到过去 24 小时发生的事件，如果我没有认识到这些决定对我们国家和我们城市的影响和重要性，那就是我的失职。
 如今，沮丧、恐惧、焦虑和悲伤等情绪很普遍。
 作为一个委员会，我们有责任在我们的职责范围内开展工作，为那些居民、人际关系、身体自主权或身份面临风险的人提供支持和倡导。
 当国家层面的政治确实令人难以承受时，我们可以求助于我们自己的社区来改善地方层面的生活。
 我很自豪能在社区发展委员会任职，也为我的董事会成员感到自豪，我鼓励每个有幸和有能力为社区服务的人尽其所能，无论是捐赠时间、金钱还是同情心。
 我也为梅德福感到非常自豪。
 我们城市的选民投票率约为 67%，大部分支持为我们的邻居、社区和梅德福的未来服务的候选人和事业。
 现在，让我们深入讨论我们的会议议程，并履行董事会的使命，以协调和全面的方式指导居住在梅德福的每个人的成长和发展。
 谢谢。
 因此，我们今晚议程上的第一个项目是 21 日在圣保罗举行的公开听证会。
 克拉拉的道路。
 这是使用多佛修正案的场地规划审查。
 我将阅读公开听证会通知。
 梅德福社区发展委员会将于 2024 年 11 月 6 日举行公开听证会。
 下午 6:30后
 通过 Zoom 远程视频会议处理 Assisi Holdings LLC 提交的场地规划审查请求，该请求旨在翻修位于 21 St. 的现有四层、12,930 平方英尺的建筑。 Clair Road, Medford, MA 02155 与拟议的 40 个房间的妇女和儿童庇护所相关。
 根据《梅德福分区条例》第 94-11-8 条，该项目需要接受多佛修正案用途的场地规划审查，并需要社区发展委员会的批准。
 我想请团队提供一些介绍性意见。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=296.17s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: 谢谢主席女士。
 再次是高级规划师丹妮尔·埃文斯 (Danielle Evans)。
 我只是想向您提供一些有关您面前的情况的基本信息。
 正如总统提到的，这是对《多佛修正案》的使用，旨在用于受第 48 章第 3 节（称为《多佛修正案》）保护的用途。
 因此，它为某些用途提供保护。
 在这种情况下，教育用途可以使它们免受某些分区条例要求的影响，例如它们可以位于何处以及如何获得尺寸标准和停车要求等要求的豁免。
 因此，场地规划审查的范围较为有限。
 因此，会议仅限于两次磋商。
 还有第一个问题。
 必须回答的答案是：该使用是否符合多佛修正案的保护条件？
 其次，关于建筑物的体积和高度以及庭院大小、地块面积、后退、开放空间、停车场和使用时应施加的建筑覆盖要求的确定，有哪些合理的规定？
 今晚董事会允许的行动是批准、有条件批准或拒绝，但只能因未能提供必要信息而被拒绝。
 所以我只是想摆好桌子，让人们知道今晚的审查内容和董事会的权力。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=382.415s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 太好了，这确实有助于我们在与董事会讨论和参加公开听证会时设定期望。
 我们还可以在整个讨论过程中回过头来记住这些类型的范围。
 我想请候选人注册。
 今晚我们有候选人团队成员吗？

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=474.263s">[Mike Ross]</a>:  I can see your screen.
 OK.
 All right.
 Well, my name is Mike Ross.
 I'm an attorney with the law firm of Prince Lobel, and I'm representing the applicant tonight.
 Thank you for having me here, Madam Chair, members of the board, and for your comments thus far.
 And also for Daniel Evans for setting the table, really
 really well, just there.
 We are here on a site plan review, as Danielle mentioned, for 21 St.
 Clair Road, and this is a photo of it.
 What we're proposing tonight is a women's and children's shelter.
 And we have members of our team who are prepared to speak about that as well.
 But what I'm going to do is going to provide a high-level overview and then see if there are any questions.
 So this is our team, essentially.
 So Andrew Litchfield and Stephen Sveta comprise Assisi Holdings.
 These are two real estate
 professionals who have a variety of portfolio of properties and within them properties that deal specifically with social services like the one we're proposing tonight, as well as other properties as well, market rate and the like.
 They had previously worked with one of our providers, and that's Taisha Gushard.
 And Taisha has worked with a number of non-profits within the state dealing with shelter care, but also specifically with what we're proposing here, domestic violent care, particularly for women and typically young children.
 Taisha has worked with
 and her entity is called Pathway Alliance.
 She has worked with an organization called Justice for Housing.
 Justice for Housing is here tonight, led by Leslie Creedle.
 And Leslie brought one of her colleagues, Ruth Rollins, who does direct care, has been doing it for decades, I believe 30 years.
 So we have a real deep bench here to talk about the type of work we're doing, if that's what the board wants to hear about.
 Not here tonight, but provided in the materials that we've submitted to the board.
 is our engineer, Fasin O'Neill, who did a traffic review of the site.
 Our architect, Eric Zacherson, who provided the plans I'll share with you.
 Landscape architect, MDLA.
 And then there's myself and Maggie from Prince Lopel.
 And what we're proposing is the use I mentioned, we're calling it Halo House.
 And as mentioned by Danielle,
 The entitlement, the approval that we're seeking, site plan review is through the Dover Amendment that I'll walk through in a second.
 This is the site here at 21 St.
 Clair Road.
 It's next to, perhaps you'll recall, a somewhat newish condo development across from the parish center.
 It's sitting on a 5,396 square foot parcel.
 with an existing gross square floor area of just under 13,000.
 Previously used as a convent and also listed as a boarding house.
 Previously, it was a religious use and I would suspect it also came under some form of Dover amendment.
 But it's interesting, I looked at the property and the land itself was already subdivided and predates the zoning code, which in Medford is fairly early, 1925.
 Yes.
 And this site is 1924.
 The building itself was improved on the property in
 1956.
 And I just thought this was interesting.
 The name of the road used to be called Love Lane.
 I just saw that when I was grabbing the documents.
 This is the existing structure.
 As you can see, it sits really tight on the property line.
 There's not a lot of space.
 And one of the reasons why I went to the history of the site is that this is not a case where we're showing up and finding just an empty parcel of land and we could build anything there.
 What we're dealing with is an existing condition that we're inheriting that has been in place
 as a building since 1956, as a parcel since 1925 or 1924.
 So we're taking an already subdivided, non-conforming structure, parcel, and trying to make a
 a use of the parcel, but also very closely following in what was previously there, at least in use, in terms of the impact and what have you.
 So I also want to just point out that even though there is almost no land to work with around this parcel and in this building, what is there is not really
 I don't know, utilized to the fullest and to the best.
 I mean, you can see the side of the building there.
 It's kind of an area for trash toters to be stored.
 The front doesn't have any kind of plantings.
 As you can see, you don't see bushes or trees or anything around the site.
 So there are things you could do, but it's just a very tight site.
 And this is the front of it.
 There's also no
 Sidewalk on this parcel, which we're proposing to add in front of our building.
 As you can see here again, this is the front of the building.
 And, you know, whether.
 it goes to the sidewalk, when it goes to this road, formerly Love Road, now St.
 Clair, we received a report from the Public Works Department saying that this is a private road, and it may be, but everything we've seen says that this is a public road.
 Medford's own street book lists it as a public road, and we did some other looking in the Registry of Deeds, and it was referenced as a public
 roadway by by recently developed projects.
 So, I mean, I didn't do the full title examination, we could, but it seems to me that is a public road, and would invite a sidewalk and and and parking in front.
 This is the site plan, again, you can see how tight it is on that parcel really built out to the edge.
 And yeah.
 So I'm going to show you these plans really quickly.
 This is the existing plans.
 The existing setup is a 27, 29 room, depending on how you count the rooms.
 former convent with these rear rooms, as you can see here, this community, this cafeteria on the first floor, this chapel on the second floor, this community room on the third floor.
 Okay, and that's the fourth floor.
 Um, as being kind of open spaces, and then you see this large, uh.
 Classroom on the 2nd floor here, this is the existing conditions.
 Okay.
 And what we're going to be proposing, I'll show you in a moment here.
 These are the existing elevations and again, I'm going to show you what we're proposing here in a moment.
 All right, here's what we're proposing.
 So we took those back rooms, that classroom, and that chapel, and that other larger spaces, and are able to put rooms in those spaces.
 And then that classroom along the second floor, we're able to divide that.
 and create 37 rooms for this facility now.
 And as you can see, these rooms have adjoining doors.
 And the reason why they have adjoining doors is because many of our clients who will come to this facility may have young children.
 You know typical age and we can talk more about this are toddlers but they might go all the way up into the to the young teens or teenagers but typically you'll see younger children with their mother.
 And in such a case where you might have, say, you know, a brother and sister or two brothers or something, there might be what would be appropriate would be to have an adjoining room next to the mother's room.
 And that's what we can do with these configurations.
 There's a lot of flexibility for that with these various rooms.
 There's also a tremendous investment in this building.
 This building needs to be fully upgraded with all new systems, all new mechanicals, all new safety devices, and it needs new HVAC systems, new floorings, new
 a lot of renovation on the inside.
 We're predicting that the renovation costs will be 800 to a million dollars on the interior of this building, as well as some minor work to do on the exterior.
 There is no change to the envelope of this building.
 The building is staying exactly the same.
 On the fourth floor,
 Yes let me make one other point this first floor is really where all the education and classrooms and discussions and job training and.
 even areas for children to play, will be used.
 Lots of flex space, a lot of ability to use that first floor in that regard.
 And then each floor has a corner room, which is a flex room in its own self that can be used as an office or as a
 Kind of alternative room, but it could also be used as a room if it's needed.
 And that's on the floors.
 Uh, 2, 3 and 4 room 14 room 27 and room 40. so those are 3 additional rooms.
 Um.
 So, we can talk more about the activities that occur there and then on the exterior of this.
 building, what are we going to do?
 We're going to remove the cross and the birds.
 We will replace, we will, you know, point and repair the bricks, repair the windows, replace some if needed.
 We'll be adding a signage to the front door that says Halo House.
 you'll see there that there is a lift to be proposed on the front entry and really that's the only substantially noticeable change to the front and to the really to all the elevations of the building except for this is that right side of the building and then on the left side of the building what we'd like to do here based on some of the comments we've received from staff
 Is to create a path of accessible travel here.
 So we have a redundant travel.
 We have a lift in the front, but we also have a ramp along the side of the building at construction level drawings.
 We will.
 have to do a little bit of work on this ramp.
 Ramps require a railing and they require a flat period for just a certain section of the ramp.
 Our architect will do that, but this was something that we at this level are just describing as a ramp.
 And we'll have to flush it out a little bit more when we get to construction level drawings.
 Okay, and then landscaping, I mentioned that there's very sparse, not a lot of plantings or anything happening on the site here.
 We're proposing, I believe, over approximately 50 plantings, trees, bushes, and the like along the front of the building, along the sides of the building, and then creating spaces and areas for people to gather.
 So that space on the right side where you saw the toters earlier and the garbage barrels.
 those would be replaced with an exterior area for guests, for clients to gather, to recreate, to sit, to have a cup of coffee, to do whatever.
 And then in the back, the same type of area there.
 Now, one thing we don't have here and we're talking about, and it's something that came from our caregiving team, is to create some sort of play space.
 What we think we're gonna do is that area that you see is eight and nine there, that that would be turned into some play area for our kids.
 It's just basic kind of playground type equipment, nothing too sophisticated.
 There's not a lot of space there, but we might incorporate that section five into it as well.
 That's a little bit of a change that we're proposing here based on some of the conversations we've had recently as we prepared to be ready for this hearing and having conversations with our team.
 And this is just some more detail that we'll be fencing that are mentioned on our site plan and are in the plans.
 And these are the types of bushes and trees and foliage and the like that we'll be planting.
 So just, you know, in terms of the Dover Amendment, which is the name given to 40A section three, Daniel already mentioned it.
 There's just two qualifications here.
 One is the use, an accepted use under the Dover, under 40A3.
 And we submit that we are, we are a providing educational services.
 I can, I provided the, and then are we,
 Are we, what are the reasonable regulations concerning the structures themselves?
 And that section two, I said to you earlier, given the site, given the history of the site and given the plan, we are doing everything we can to make best use of it.
 We are not changing the size, the envelope of the site, if you will.
 And we are working as best we can to utilize the entire site.
 uh, within the confines of this pre-existing non-conformance structure and use.
 I provided a, uh, a more detailed, um, application with some, um, more detail on both of these points, uh, uh, prior to today's hearing.
 Um, but you know, um,
 And I'm just kind of pulling from the language of 40A Section 3 of this nonprofit use that would be educating as an education component.
 And I go a little bit deeper.
 To point out that, in fact, a use is essentially what we're providing a domestic violent shelter for women and children that's intended on providing life skills, job skills, some of just the very basic skills that people need to function and stand on their own is really the very essence of what an appropriate and acceptable use would be under the Dover Amendment.
 I want to tell you a little bit about the Pathway Alliance group, Taisha's group, and they are all available for questions.
 I imagine you'll have some for them.
 It's a really interesting group that I've gotten to know and meet through this process.
 They're dealing with
 So they have some very strict guidelines of their own.
 They see clients that are typically between six months and a year, and they do have a year as being the maximum time that they want to have any one resident staying in their facility.
 And one of the things that I learned from Leslie, who's going to be working with this group, is that they've had tremendous success with
 not seeing recidivism in their space.
 I think she has a 99% success rate, meaning that 99%, at least in the case of Leslie's efforts, clients have gone on to stable housing and not relapsed, which I think is a
 This is the work they do with their clients.
 They spend a lot of time getting their clients to stand on their own two feet so they can go out and apply for and have permanent housing.
 And this is the work that they do with their clients on a regular basis.
 So here with us today is Taisha from the
 I guess the from the pathway entity and working now with Leslie from justice for housing and then Ruth Rollins has brought in was brought in by Leslie Ruth has her own entity that she works with called we are better together.
 But Ruth also does direct service and has been in the.
 Has been in this, as I mentioned, for at least 30 years.
 1 of the groups that we're going to be working with is a group called RG reliable riders transportation company.
 This is a shuttle service.
 It's a van.
 The effort is to create 3 trips, or maybe more today to provide for the clients, but also provide for.
 employees the team understands that there is no parking at this facility the team will solve for that challenge they will solve for it for any of their staff who have parking needs we believe that those are maybe three or four people and they will find a area
 garage that may not be in Medford, it may be closer to transit, it may be some of the transit that they have.
 There's a lot of parking in those areas.
 And then the shadow will create predictability for these employees.
 In terms of clients, I'm told that
 No clients have cars, at least it's been the experience of all of our practitioners that clients do not come with their own cars.
 And so that solves an issue right there for us.
 So we feel confident and comfortable that the shuttle service will provide full access to and from the facility without needing to have on-site parking.
 And that being said, Andrew and Steve continue to talk to abutters and neighbors to see if there are opportunities, but so far there have not been.
 And again, we do not feel like that's necessary, but more we need to solve for some of the questions and some of the permitting questions that we've been asked during this process.
 And so we are trying to see if maybe we can even just have a couple of spaces nearby, even though we don't think it will be essential for the program.
 Go through this a little bit.
 I mean, there will be 24 hour security and there will always be a staff member on site at all times.
 Um, the facility provides on site, um, laundry services and, you know, food and meals as commercial kitchen.
 Um, and, um, and of course, sleeping, sleeping arrangements.
 Um, I'm going to skip over a couple of these items.
 Because I want to.
 available for questions if you have it.
 There's all kinds of classes, counseling, job counseling, meditation services, financial literacy classes, and the like.
 Other educational credit counseling services.
 I mentioned financial literacy coaching.
 This is what I wanted to show you.
 This is Justice for Housing.
 This is Leslie's entity right now.
 She has two
 buildings right now that she's operating.
 74 Morris Street in Dorchester and 241 Woodrow Ave in Dorchester.
 Both of these properties are right in residential neighborhoods.
 If you walk by them, you would think that they're just a regular house in Dorchester.
 They know their neighbors, they are active in their community.
 During the fall, there might be
 a pumpkin on the stair, you know, et cetera.
 These are people who are in this house all the time.
 And this was that stat that I heard from Leslie earlier.
 They have over 367 clients.
 Only 1% has needed to go back into temporary housing.
 The rest have really been able to get on their own feet.
 Tiesha has worked with all these other groups, as have the other two practitioners who are with us, Ruthie and Leslie, but Tiesha has worked with all these other groups in some capacity.
 She may be referring someone from the Pines Trident, she may be referring someone from St.
 Francis, Casa Merna, etc.
 The one thing I've heard from all the practitioners is that
 There are almost no domestic violence resources anywhere in Massachusetts.
 It's extremely hard to find any resource like this.
 There might be a scattered site here and there in someone's house separated from services.
 This is a very rare thing indeed.
 There are a number of rules associated.
 This will be a non-smoking facility.
 There's no alcohol, no drugs.
 These are very regimented facilities that are supervised and intended to help bring people into a healthy environment and get them into the right pathway.
 So now I want to shift from the use and just kind of close out here more on some of the physical attributes of the site.
 Some of the maybe even you might say shortcomings of the site, but that we're dealing with as a result and how we're dealing with those challenges as we are proposing here to you for site plan review.
 Um, so, uh, there is no parking.
 I mentioned that.
 Um, I also mentioned that most residents will not own their own vehicle.
 I believe all of the clients will not own their own vehicle.
 And in the case of those two or three staff members, I believe that we will be creating a shuttle service that will bring them to the facility.
 Um, there's ample MBTA services.
 Uh, there are always going to be an employee on site, but the total number of employees, not that many, five to six,
 And that during any one shift, there might be half of that.
 The I did want to just have this little graphic on the side that, you know, there is we do want to build a sidewalk off of our property.
 We don't have.
 We would provide those two to the city for approval.
 And we do believe this is a 61 foot frontage on the site we do believe that there would be space for at least two, maybe three, three cars on the front of the building.
 Yeah, so I do think practically speaking, pickup, drop off, you know, deliveries, those types of things, it's good to have some space to do that with.
 And that would be what that would be made available for.
 I mentioned there's ample parking and then, of course, the orange line and the shuttle will tie into these resources.
 We provided a traffic study from Fossil O'Neill engineers.
 This is, I just wanted to share with you, is that the way traffic studies work, as you've seen in your capacity as on this board, is they look at what the previous use was, they look at what the proposed use is, and they see what the difference is.
 Here, there is no difference because the previous use and the proposed use have the same impact based on what we're proposing, based on what was there.
 Uh, and that's, uh, we've provided this, this, um, memorandum from Faso O'Neill, and we're happy to, you know, uh, answer any questions about that.
 Uh, Faso O'Neill concludes that based on the foregoing assessment, it is the professional opinion of Faso O'Neill that the proposed development at 21 St.
 Clair will have negligible impacts on traffic operation within the study areas.
 Just finally, finally,
 Finally here.
 So there were a number of comments made from your various departments within Medford, by the way, it's been a pleasure to work with Medford and your various departments and your staff, and all of us for certain things and we are fully compliant to with all of these items that they've asked us to, of course, most of these things are going to have to happen once we get into the actual.
 work and the construction level documents.
 I mentioned the wheelchair ramp at the side entrance and some of the other items that I shared during the course of this presentation.
 So now might be, Madam Chair, a good time for me to pause and answer any questions along with the team as well.
 Thank you for the opportunity to be in front of you today.
 Thank you.

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2024.899s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 感谢您的完整演示。
 我很欣赏细节。
 因此，为了让每个人都了解它会是什么样子，我将向董事会开放我们的问题和评论。
 之后，将有一个公众评议期。
 公众评议期结束后将进行理事会审议。
 话虽如此，我愿意向董事会提出任何问题或意见。
 董事会成员，请随时举手或取消静音。
 亚当.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2062.907s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: 嘿伙计们。
 谢谢你的介绍，迈克尔。
 只是一个关于教育服​​务的问题。
 尤其是教师身上也会发生同样的情况。
 呃，因为专门隶属于克莱尔路 21 号，他们是一个更大组织的一部分，嗯，并且在特定的一周内，这种工作是如何进行的，或者你们有什么样的流程？
 从教师的角度分配教学资源，以实现您所描述的教育目标并为住宿者提供机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2116.469s">[Mike Ross]</a>: 是的，我真的很感激这个问题。
 我想如果莱斯利、塔莎或露丝做出回应，你会得到更好的答案。
 我不知道你们中是否有人想谈谈你们在教学课程中的定位以及诸如此类的事情。
 我不知道那是不是你，莱斯利，或者我的意思是，我可以根据我们谈论的内容进行尝试。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2139.85s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>: 那时我无法取消静音。
 这就是为什么我没有回应。
 感谢今晚在场的董事会女士、工作人员和会员允许我们进行演示。
 我们有一个结构
 教育系统真正注重劳动力发展和让人们重返工作岗位。
 我们有一位持有执照的 CDL 培训师，他会来并
 我们还有一个组件，人们可以学习如何安装窗户或太阳能电池板。
 这为我们的参与者创造了就业机会。
 84% 的参与者购买了
 生活工资，以便他们能够负担得起生活工资住房，而无需公共住房或任何类似设施的任何援助。
 我们还教育人们并获取简历、数字素养、计算机技能以及人们在重建生活时需要的自然事物。
 我可以说，大多数参与者都过着这样的生活
 关于福利、社会保障等权力体系，以及阻碍他们获得可持续工作的因素。
 因此，这是一个新的开始。
 另外，我们还有生活技能。
 我不知道 Ruthie 或 Tisha 是否还想补充什么。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2284.71s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 如果您在取消静音时遇到困难，请告诉 Taisha，我知道您正在通话中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2289.892s">[Taisha Gishard]</a>: 完美的。
 是的，谢谢。
 除此之外，是的，我们会有人来找我们，而不是，你知道，顾客必须离开场所。
 我确信有些事情他们会去外面做，但大多数事情都会在现场进行。
 所以我希望我回答了这个问题。
 不知道Ruthie还有什么要补充的吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2324.075s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: 露丝·沃伦斯。
 是的，晚安。
 是的，是的，我希望我能为这个问题增添更多价值。
 因此，根据我们将与之合作的人群，我们有过与该人群合作经验的所有提供者和社区合作伙伴都将获得创伤信息。
 因此，您知道，我们不仅要提高金融知识并为他们提供家庭暴力服务方面的支持，而且我们还将与孩子们一起努力。
 因此，我们三个人拥有执业医生、创伤支持和家庭暴力服务。
 事实上，我们已经与正在开展这项工作的其他组织建立了服务和合作伙伴关系。
 因此，我们只是想为整个家庭提供全面、赋能的服务。
 因此，我们并不是根据我们在这项工作中的经验来重新创造一些新的东西。
 我们已经有在线合作伙伴与我们合作，他们将前来与客户合作。
 目标是为该项目所在的居民提供服务。
 所以我希望我能够为这个问题增加价值。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2400.317s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>: 是的，重点是维护和重建。
 因此，正如她所说，建立你的简历、金融知识，信用是一个很大的障碍。
 所以我们真正关注的是预算、信贷、如何管理银行账户、如何获得抵押贷款。
 我们的目标是让人们
 稳定住房和房屋所有权的庇护所。
 这就是我们在住房正义中的角色。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2438.402s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 亚当，还有其他问题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2446.665s">[Peter Calves]</a>: 我身体不太好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2448.106s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢。
 我看到桌子上有两只手，我想我还看到了一位观众的手。
 快速提醒一下：现在这些是论坛问题和评论，我们将继续讨论公众评论。
 阿里，我想接下来我看到了你的手。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2464.962s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: 完美的。
 谢谢主席女士，也谢谢竞选公职的候选人。
 这看起来是一个非常棒的项目，将为社区带来很多好处。
 我的问题实际上更多是针对市政府官员和
 如果您能告诉我们一些关于多佛修正案中非传统学校（即不是大学、公立学校等）的常见情况，我会很高兴。
 我想这是一个常见问题。
 因此，如果您能为观众提供一些背景、历史和规则，我们将非常感激。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2505.635s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 当然，主席女士。
 我是当这个案例最初给我们带来这个潜在项目的时候。
 我们与 KP Law 的律师之一罗宾·斯坦 (Robin Stein) 会面，探讨如何允许这种行为（如果允许的话）。
 当她的律师说，好吧，这将是对多佛的利用时，她向我们保证，这实际上是允许此类项目的一种非常常见的方式。
 虽然这不是那种晚上开门的避难所，但人们会进来睡觉，然后在白天离开。
 这不一定是我们没有谈论的事情。
 这是有人居住的地方，也是提供支持服务的地方。
 他说这在多佛通常被允许使用。
 我没有，我没有注意判例法。
 我不确定这是否有帮助，但我认为原告的律师已经准备好了一些判例法，可以根据需要引用。
 我们相信我们律师的说法，这是允许此类项目的标准方式。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2578.155s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: Ari，您有兴趣听听这些信息吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2581.076s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: 你知道，我们不必阅读每一个字，但我很想听到对此的确认。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2589.82s">[Mike Ross]</a>: 是的，我的意思是，你知道，也许我让玛吉站在甲板上，让你陷入困境，我的搭档。
 谁追查了所有这些案件。
 但我的意思是，我认为你在梅德福，你可能已经习惯了塔夫茨大学的加入，并且你知道，根据多佛修正案进行申请。
 但实际上概念是一样的。
 它旨在用于教育目的。
 问题是这样的设施是否会
 符合资格。
 我认为主要的案例是麦克莱恩医院，我相信每个人都听说过。
 麦克莱恩医院以更大的规模提供我们在这里讨论的许多类型的服务。
 麦克莱恩医院最初允许其设施靠近林肯，我相信，
 也许不是那么近，但在马萨诸塞州。
 这是马萨诸塞州的一个案例。
 这是我们在发送给您的材料中引用的麦克莱恩的类似版本，这正是所引用的内容，这也是最高法院引用并继续引用的该领域最新类型的相关法律。
 出于这些原因以及许多其他原因，我的意思是，我不知道，玛吉，我在那里的程度如何，如果你是的话，
 玛吉·罗伯茨，律师。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2679.811s">[SPEAKER_19]</a>: 我同意迈克所说的：有一整套判例法，但这实际上都归结为这个广泛概念的教育目的。
 我想，你知道，这就是这个案例，还有很多其他案例，是的，
 有一些沉浸式住宿项目，他们教客户如何过上富有成效的生活并保持独立。
 我认为这句话是说教育是一个广泛的概念。
 是的，就像迈克说的，你可以
 是的，这是一个超越传统学校的更广泛的概念。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2740.403s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: 谢谢。
 我发现菲奇堡案例中的这句话非常有用且明智。
 现在它位于共享屏幕上。
 感谢您的完整回答。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2755.651s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢阿里。
 彼得，我看到你的手了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2760.853s">[Peter Calves]</a>: 是的，我有一个问题要问候选人并确认一些事情。
 申请人面临的问题是：现场提供的教育服务范围是什么？
 你把它弄坏了并且
 每天的教学时间？
 或者它不是一个可以用这样的东西来衡量的模型吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2798.205s">[Mike Ross]</a>: 嗯，我的意思是，我们距离开业还有几个月的时间，我们仍然需要建造设施。
 我们需要
 正式让团队参与并邀请他们来做这项工作。
 因此，也许您可​​以要求他们谈论他们在其他设施的经验以及基于我们客户数量等的目标。
 但我们距离开业可能还有六个月的时间。
 如果可能的话，我只想将其中一些内容放在括号中。
 也许吧，阿什利。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2838.915s">[Peter Calves]</a>: 明亮的。
 正如我所说，我只是想了解该网站提供的教育服务的范围。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2848.302s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>: 是的，我可以通过我们拥有的其他随机房屋来判断。
 首先，没有两个案例是相同的。
 并不是每个人都有同样的社会问题，对吗？
 首先我们有案例经理进行评估，对吧？
 我们的目标是稳定，然后教育，重建，然后集中
 上，你说什么，在外面，如何离开家。
 首先，我们有负责评估需求的案例经理。
 我们有

 这给了我，对我来说已经足够了，至少对我对编程的理解来说。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2980.463s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 任何其他卡
 意见或问题？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=2984.459s">[Peter Calves]</a>: 哦，等一下。
 我意识到还有一些事情。
 其中之一只是确认圣。克莱尔路，至少在马萨诸塞州交通部的高速公路管辖范围内，高速公路库存地图，这是我作为交通工程师的日常工作，我们用它来确定圣克莱尔路的管辖范围。
 克莱尔路被列为公共道路，因此这支持了申请人的主张，也是我们需要解决的问题。
 我认为这个问题是，哦，等等，不。
 我想说的是，我有一个问题要问市政府工作人员，关于多佛修正案有哪些选择。
 但我认为罗斯律师对它们的审查做得很好。
 事实上，我把它们写在我的笔记里。
 所以谢谢你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3043.403s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 太好了，谢谢佩德罗。
 董事会还有其他意见或问题吗？
 在进入公众评议期之前，我只是想分享一些想法。
 我看到今晚的电话会议有很多人参加，所以我会简短发言。
 我喜欢你提到在大楼前增加一条人行道。
 然而，这在街角和圣路易斯之间留下了很大的差距。
 克莱尔路大厦。
 这是我想了解更多的事情，或者也许我们可以定义我们的术语。
 停车永远是梅德福的一个问题。
 作为一个城市，我们正在努力确保我们正在做正确的事情来做到这一点。
 得知停车解决方案仍在开发中时，我有点担心。
 我听过您对公共汽车的评论，这可能更多是城市工作人员的问题，但我很想知道圣路易斯目前存在哪些停车规定或限制（如果有）。
 克莱尔或者如果只是一个
 狂野西部，就像我们在梅德福的道路一样。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3117.738s">[Mike Ross]</a>: 我确信我认为团队的印象是这是一个私人道路区域来观看它。
 看起来确实是这样的。
 我不会责怪他们认为正是如此。
 你知道，我想我们很乐意通过在大楼前修建一条人行道来支持这座城市。
 我想象在某个时刻。
 你知道，该市可能会想投资一些资本资源在那里修建人行道，尽管这将是该市的决定，但我认为至少是这样。
 撞到我们的人行道上。
 我们可以尽我们的一份力量来支持这一努力，我们可以创建适当的过渡回到地面状态，你知道，无论是两侧的触觉带，但公共工程部希望我们这样做。
 然后当其他街道准备好时，你知道，当其他人行道准备好时，它就会起作用。
 但我认为考虑从这一侧到拐角建造一整条人行道的成本太高了
 还有一些与邻居的物流。
 这只是让我们处于一个完全不同的角色和成本范围，而我们并不准备这样做。
 但为了回应这一评论，我们同意开放我们设施前的人行道。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3200.055s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我很欣赏这些评论。
 我看到亨特主任举起了手。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3206.804s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 谢谢主席女士。
 或多或少是关于整体、人行道、无障碍部分。
 我认为我们确实需要弄清楚我们的城市是否认为这是一条私人道路。
 如果是公共道路，我们需要对其进行检查并了解其宽度。
 如果我们能在它所在的地方有一条人行道，那么另一边显然就没有路缘石了。
 它只是匹配一个停车场。
 更好地了解您符合我们的利益。
 显然，今晚我们不会得到答案。
 关于这个特定问题已经有很多来回。
 如果这是一条公共道路，没有人行道，但有空间，那么我想我们的交通和工程部门会要求人行道一直到人行道，而不仅仅是在他们自己的财产前面。
 如果有空间存在的话，这将是一个标准订单。
 撇开这个不谈，我认为这个问题今晚无法解决。
 哪里可能有某种形式的公共停车场的问题是我们所有的公共道路都向公众开放。
 除非是在私人道路上，否则某人房屋前面的任何地方都不是私人的。
 不过，我要提一下，如果你穿过富尔顿街，抱歉，Fells Way West，
 在富尔顿街的另一边，即吉利斯公园对面的富尔顿街一段，两边都有停车场。
 我们发现吉利斯和希基公园这个角落的大楼里的人把车停在那条街上。
 那里通常有路边停车位。
 如果我们谈论的是两到三名员工，
 他们没有理由不能把车停在 Fellsway West 的另一边，然后步行一两个街区到工作地点。
 我觉得这很合理。
 我认为总的来说，我们对停车的关注是居民车辆。
 据我所知，无家可归者往往没有车辆，除非他们住在车里。
 这就是他们到达避难所之前所在的地方。
 另外一点是，如果一个人是家庭暴力的受害者，并不一定意味着他的收入很低。
 他们可能需要去避难所，因为他们要逃离某人，但这并不意味着他们没有车。
 所以我认为该组织确实需要考虑这一点，因为这里不会有住宅车辆的长期停车位。
 我们在几栋建筑中提出的建议条件之一，无论建筑类型如何，我们一直在为我们的高性能公寓楼所做的事情，
 租户没有资格获得住宅停车许可证。
 而这也是本案可以付诸实践的一个条件。
 我知道该社区目前没有停车许可证。
 这意味着永远不会有停车许可证。
 未来可能会有这样的情况，具体情况取决于施工的持续时间。
 所以谢谢你。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3411.653s">[SPEAKER_26]</a>: 我可以很快介入吗？
 我们目前有一所家庭暴力之家，有 22 个房间，而且我们的参与者都没有汽车。
 我们拥有的三栋房子里，没有一个居民拥有汽车。
 如果您有车，正如我们之前提到的，我们将有一辆巴士每天三趟到达该设施，带您前往火车站，并且我们为您提供 T 通行证。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=3449.56s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 这是非常有用的信息。
 谢谢莱斯利。

 您是否已收到该方使用该工具的书面批准？
 我有很多问题，但我很失望我只有两分钟的时间，因为这种情况已经持续很长时间了，两分钟是不够的。
 我是直接邻居。
 我的房产被列为地块 22。
 我想解释一下，停车是我们这个社区的主要问题，安全其次。
 大楼前拟建一条人行道。
 没有人提到那里有一个消防栓，而且它实际上是一条消防通道。
 没有任何外在的东西
 消防通道，有 40 个房间，今晚你会了解到现在有 37 个房间，这与他们最初提出的计划不同。
 而且没有电梯。
 一楼有两间卧室，可供行动不便的人士使用。
 建筑物的周长。
 左侧有四英尺，拟议的侧门坡道将通过该处。
 孩子们如何到达这个地方结构？
 拐角是沿建筑物左侧靠着铁丝网的整个宽度，超过四英尺。
 后面的长度为一米半，在右角增加到两米。
 我想指出规划中存在的问题。

 看来有两个层次。

 晚安。
 感谢您组织这次会议。
 我叫丽莎·西蒙内蒂 (Lisa Simonetti)，住在富尔顿斯普林路 85 号。
 所以我和圣人是站在同一边的。
 弗朗西斯科和里奇韦。
 连续第三次。
 所以我有一些问题。
 我希望我能拜访他们。
 我很想从他们那里得到一些关于他们的答案。
 我想知道您所说的最大入住人数是多少。
 你说这是一个可以容纳40人的避难所。
 所以今晚我们发现这是一个家庭暴力庇护所，我知道人们需要一个安全的地方，但在这个拥挤的社区有 40 名居住者，或者是 40 名成人和任意数量的儿童？
 我想知道最多入住人数是多少。
 我知道多佛是一项坚实的教育修正案。
 坦率地说，考虑到富尔顿高地已经变得非常非常拥挤的地区，将其与坐落在贝尔蒙特起伏的草坪上的麦克莱恩医院进行比较有点不诚实。
 富尔顿街上的几栋房屋现在是出租单位，停放在圣路易斯的里奇韦。
 弗朗西斯路和富尔顿斯普林路是私人道路，保持这些道路的良好状况对我们的城市没有好处。
 我们非常拥堵，坦率地说，我很想知道他们什么时候进行了交通研究。
 我同意住在圣路易斯的人们的观点。
 克莱尔，因为那是我的教区教堂，是消防通道。
 对于圣约翰教堂中仍在说的少数弥撒来说。
 弗朗西斯科教区，如果上帝禁止发生火灾，并且因为有停车场和通往旧修道院的人行道而无法让消防车通过，那么周六和周日会发生什么？
 而且要说用途是一模一样的，首先，那栋楼已经空了不知道多少年了。
 与住在那里的 15 或 18 名修女相比，她们从来没有车辆或任何东西，除了现在每年 365 天、每天 24 小时都有全职工作人员，这对梅德福人民来说是非常不诚实和不诚实的，他们将在一个非常非常拥挤的地区为家庭暴力受害者提供庇护所。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4114.868s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢你，丽莎。

 我们住在 463 Fellsway West，我的前门面向圣路易斯。
 克拉拉的道路。
 再说一遍，我不确定您所做的流量研究。
 我对车道以及车道有多小也有同样的问题。
 教堂后门后面和圣彼得大教堂之间只有一条小路。
 弗朗西斯科街。
 然后我们有这两个地方停在别人的财产上，大约
 10 英尺宽，供过往车辆使用。
 因此，该地区的停车和交通肯定会受到影响。
 我知道你说人们不会开车去上班，人们不会在避难所拥有汽车，但我已经可以看到，我们拥有的两个空间，因为我们不能停在房子前面，也不能停在房子侧面，会受到影响。
 我还担心附近无家可归者收容所的到来。
 几年前我们刚刚建造了这些公寓单元，这确实增加了附近的人口数量、用水量和其他一切。
 我很沮丧。
 我有一个有特殊需要的儿子。
 发生这种情况非常令人不安
 我觉得这对我的儿子、我的家人来说是一个安全问题，我对此并不满意。
 我不敢相信我们今晚会听到有关贝德福德无家可归者收容所的消息。</p>

 我还在城里拥有一家企业。
 我担心的是大楼的安全。
 凭借他们拥有的四套公寓，我接听了很多电话。
 如果三楼、二楼、三楼或四楼出现问题，是否会有电梯，或者紧急服务人员是否必须爬四层楼梯？
 整个建筑是否符合 ADA 标准？
 我认为作为一个教育机构，它应该符合 ADA 标准。
 地板上到处都是。
 所以我想得到这个问题的答案。
 我还想知道为什么交通研究，附近的市民看不到交通研究。
 我想尝试推迟到将来，因为我想咨询律师并让他看看交通研究。
 我还想知道它是否会获得 ADA 批准。
 我担心火灾和大楼里的孩子们。
 如果上面一层出了事，他们就得等紧急服务人员上三层、四层，怎么把他们救下来？
 令人担忧。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4510.987s">[SPEAKER_36]</a>: 我叫 Kevin Wong，来自 1 St.克拉拉的道路。
 感谢您给我发言的机会。
 该提案看起来不错，我认为如果执行得当，它可以为客户增加很多价值。
 但作为避难所所在社区的一部分，我担心该项目的长期可持续性。
 我还想确保不会对社区产生长期负面影响。
 因此，我想强调两点。
 首先，从网上的资料来看，该房产属于房地产开发商所有。
 打算从该房产中获利的人，该房产将由 Pathway Alliance 公司管理，我发现该公司成立仅三个月，由一名房地产经纪人创立。
 我认为写一个提案并在里面点名很容易，但执行起来却很难。
 其次，建议提供交通服务，但没有停车场，并且可以更直接地乘坐公共交通工具。
 庇护所能否真正实现帮助其客户康复的教育目的？
 因此，鉴于这两点，如果我可以向安理会提出要求的话，那就是考虑允许多佛修正案在这里适用的长期影响。
 确保建立机制来追究申请人和经营者的责任，以便他们继续服务于预期的教育目的。
 据我所知，没有任何记录表明它将继续长期服务于这一目的。
 仅此而已。
 我感谢董事会倾听我的意见。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4611.546s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢凯文。
 我们感谢您抽出时间。
 埃斯特万·安杰罗尼.

 你们每个人都想谈谈吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4625.193s">[SPEAKER_16]</a>: 我想是的。
 我会尽量简短。
 我是伊加·安杰洛尼和斯蒂芬·安杰洛尼。
 我们在第一街。
 克莱尔路拐角处的公寓楼。
 我认为我们都对《多佛修正案》的适用是否适当或过于宽松抱有同样的疑问。
 据我了解，只是因为
 非营利组织不会自动根据《多佛修正案》向您提供保护，除非设施的主要使用来源是教育。
 对我来说，该设施的主要来源似乎是庇护所，教育将是一个组成部分，也许是规划的一部分，尽管我承认，它有点模糊，而且还有六个月的时间，所以看起来它还没有完全开发出来。
 我想我想回应丽莎和其他一些人的观点，凯文对社区影响的观点。
 我认为总的来说，我们当然关心安全、拥堵、停车等方面的变化。
 但作为家庭暴力受害者的庇护所，我想我也担心家庭暴力，担心那些我认为是受害者的人，
 逃离发现这个区域，也许会增加，我不知道，这里的危险。
 我对安全有点好奇。
 您提到了工作人员中的保安人员，但这实际上是什么意思？
 这到底意味着什么？
 总的来说，我有点担心对我们这些每晚经过那个空间的人来说会产生长期影响。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4731.115s">[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>: 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4746.965s">[SPEAKER_23]</a>: 姓名和地址。
 你好晚安。
 我的名字是米格尔·鲁伊斯。
 我住在 45 街。
 弗朗西斯街，就在阿比塔后面。
 嗯，我想和我的许多邻居一样担心这对社区的影响。
 嗯，但我也是。
 质疑多佛法律的有效性。
 我的意思是，在教育项目中，我知道我是一名终身公务员。
 作为一名交易员，我可以说，我们需要培训劳动力，因为我们正在失去他们，但我不明白每周两天如何培训某人进行 CDL。
 他们如何在有街道穿过的停车场做到这一点？
 安装太阳能电池板又是一个好主意，但他们会把太阳能电池板挂在建筑物上吗？
 我的意思是，课堂上的作业量是有限的。
 其中很多是需要完成的在职培训。
 我的另一个担忧是整个社区。
 我了解人性。
 人们不想等待渡轮。
 他们上班会迟到。
 他们会开车。
 他们将把车停在圣路易斯。
 弗朗西斯科街。
 St. 没有停车场。
 弗朗西斯街现在的样子，多亏了富尔顿街的出租屋、公寓。
 现在，这里的许多多户住宅都挤满了租户。
 他们出租房间。
 城市允许这样做，这对他们来说是短视的。
 但我认为这个计划永远不会真正正确。
 我认为他们不会解决停车问题。
 我认为整个教育问题非常模糊。
 它只是被使用
 来庇护人们。
 正如黄先生所指出的，当这个特定的计划无法自我维持时，这座建筑的下一个用途将是什么？
 我们要向什么敞开心扉？
 这些也是邻居们关心的一些问题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4860.138s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 感谢您抽出时间。
 谢谢迈克尔。
 我很欣赏你的评论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4871.505s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: 下一个是安格斯·何。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4876.686s">[SPEAKER_38]</a>: 你好，是的，我的名字是 Pangas Ho。
 我住在圣
 克莱尔公寓（Clair Condominium），与该大楼位于同一条街上。
 因此，我想在我的其他邻居提到的基础上补充一点，我会要求议会真正调查开发商的动机。
 你知道，所以我做了一些研究，你知道，
 该开发商是剑桥萨默维尔的一家豪华住宅开发商。
 然后，也是由于历史背景，我们知道去年他们打算将这座建筑改造成九单元的公寓出售给公众。
 然后我们发现，因为他们联系我们的房主协会在我们的公寓中租用停车位，因为他们找不到公寓的停车位，所以他们无法满足分区要求。
 最后我们没有把停车位租给他们。
 因此，豪华公寓项目无法推进。
 现在他们把这个项目改造成这个避难所项目。
 正如凯文还提到的，他们创建的这个非营利组织是为了运营这个项目
 该避难所只有三个月的历史，是在试图将其改造成豪华公寓后才创建的。
 但那并没有发生，直到那时他们才创建了这个非营利组织来建造庇护所。
 再次，我真的鼓励董事会考虑这里的动机，因为我担心的是如果这里的开发商仅受利润驱动的话长期可持续性。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=4972.721s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢庞戈斯。

 我的名字是艾米丽·拉萨罗。
 我住在 170 Mystic Street Extension。
 我是梅德福市议员。
 我想表达我对这个项目的支持。
 我感谢这些组织作为一个联盟，努力让这样的事情发生。
 我是我的一员
 日常工作在马尔登变暖中心工作。
 我非常关心处理此类事情的人。
 找到住处非常困难，尤其是对于有孩子的人来说。
 我的组织无法照顾儿童，因此当您面临这样的情况时，这可能会特别困难，我赞赏您的同情心和
 对这一人群的奉献。
 我还鼓励董事会牢记挑战始终存在。
 我认为这是该小组的提案
 这份联合文书工作相当完整。
 我认为可以仔细审查，但我也认为现在是我们以同情心领导的时候，并努力记住，将会做出艰难的决定，人们将面临很多困难时期，如果我们能够尝试互相帮助并继续努力
 找到一种互相帮助并具有同理心和同情心的方法。
 我认为这是前进的最佳方式。
 如果我们能够将像这样的空建筑用于拟议的用途，我将为梅德福感到自豪。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=5100.545s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢拉扎罗参赞。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=5119.768s">[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>: 你好，我的名字是谢丽尔·罗德里格斯。
 我住在公园街 281 号，艾丽西亚·亨特说这些人可以在这个街区停车，但他们不能停车，因为这里交通太拥挤了。
 我们无法支持你。
 我认为邻居们提出了很多非常好的观点。
 市议会同意放弃所有这些要点，这有点令人遗憾。
 但这家公司很新。
 我们不知道他们是否能够在这个项目中取得成功。
 如果在那里停车太困难，他们可能会跳过教学部分并坚持使用庇护所。
 而不是。
 因此，多佛说恢复援助或帮助他们填写住房表格将使该中心具有教育意义有些言过其实，因为事实并非如此。
 如果您在建筑物前面的人行道上建造避难所，您的避难所巴士将无法掉头。
 这是一个非常狭窄的区域。
 所以如果停车场正在使用中，
 他们将无法转身。
 所以我认为他们的数学计算不正确。
 我也想知道搬到这里的学生的情况。
 他们会去梅德福学校吗？
 这是移民庇护所吗？
 每个人都需要 ELL 服务吗？
 我确信与会的每个人都知道，昨天我们批准了两项废除，因为我们的学校不堪重负。
 2024 年 3 月，我们增加了 103 名 ELL 学生，但我们无法提供支持。
 所以，如果是这样，我们又会遇到问题。
 我只是想澄清一下。
 如果他们没有这些问题的答案，我请理事会不要继续推进，因为该计划尚未制定，他们也不准备这样做。
 谢谢。</p>

 我住在25街。
 弗朗西斯街和我家面向教堂停车场。
 我对停车研究的一个问题是，我不确定他们什么时候进行这项研究，但我看到停车场在
 葬礼和弥撒之间的结合以及它们在社会中心所具有的不同功能。
 我担心孩子们的安全，而且没有一个真正的游乐场供这些孩子使用，我的意思是，你知道，我知道你谈到过建造一个小游乐场或一个
 在建筑物的侧面或其他地方。
 但孩子们不想 24/7 呆在家里。
 他们会想离开，他们也会离开。
 你知道，这就是孩子的天性。
 而且，你知道，如果有很多汽车来来往往，孩子可能会被撞到，或者你知道，可能会受到致命伤害。
 我的意思是，你知道，这是一个令人担忧的问题。
 您知道，您所说的食品卡车和运输服务的流量肯定会增加。
 再次，安全风险。
 伙计们，我是一名退休护士，我的工作之一是辅助生活，我在退休前工作了八年。
 我正在招聘和安排工作，你知道，找到合格的员工并留住他们是非常困难的。
 你知道，我担心团队 24/7 都在那里。
 但是，当案件经理周末不上班时，周末会发生什么？
 据我所知，他们一般不会。
 然后，你知道，如果，似乎在周末，工作人员较少，那么住在房子里的人就会出现问题，怎么办？
 这可能包括警察、救护车、消防队，无论什么情况。
 最后，我的问题是：在制定整个计划之前，社区考虑了什么？
 我不记得在邮件中收到过任何有关这里将要发生的事情的信息。

 嗯，安全，还有对社区的影响。
 嗯，既然我们刚刚通过了一些变革以进一步资助我们的学校，那么这些孩子实际上将在哪里获得资助？
 唔。
 也有兴趣了解更多。
 就居民总数而言。
 我知道有 40 个房间，但如果是双人间、三人间或四人间，最好能与我们分享。
 我阅读了文件并没有看到类似的内容。
 上传到谷歌网站的一些文件与今晚展示的文件相比有点矛盾。
 我还要求并挑战董事会对此事进行尽职调查，不要相信律师的话。
 你代表了这座城市以及它的居民，所以我们希望你尽职尽责，不要相信每一个律师，因为他们这么说，你阅读了文件，甚至是只成立了三个月的非营利组织。
 我还认为，昨天我们经历了一场非常激烈的选举，仅梅德福市就有四种投票选择。
 我们将在第二天晚上举行这次会议。
 我觉得他们把这个放在日历上，然后把它隐藏起来，这样居民就不会发表评论了。
 因此，我认为在做出决定之前，在不是市政选举后的第二天再安排一次会议。</p>

 由于这座建筑很小，我认为这座小建筑里没有足够的空间供儿童和妇女居住。
 而且，人行道非常狭窄，没有公共停车场，尤其是在这座大楼里。
 这会给周围街道增加很多负荷和问题。
 另一件事是现在
 40个房间住了40个人，差不多有40个家庭，我们不知道其中有多少成员会住在这里。
 我会给我们社区的未来增添许多不确定性。
 我是新居民。
 我几个月前刚搬家。
 所以当我……在买这所房子之前，我发现了一个美妙、美好的地方……这是一个美好、安静、平和的社区。
 好邻居，安静的街道，你知道的。
 在我家后面，它看起来像一座教堂。
 一切都令人难以置信。
 这就是我买这个房子的原因。
 所以我觉得很幸福，但是……
 当我听到这个消息时，确实给我家的未来增添了很多不确定性，所以我感到非常担心。
 所以我只是想知道如何解决这个问题，让我们感觉更安全，让我们的邻居感觉更安全。</p>

 我们22年前搬到这里。
 我们养育了两个孩子。
 这是一个很棒的社区。
 感谢董事会允许我们举行听证会，感谢迈克尔·罗斯和他的团队。
 提供了大量数据。
 你知道，我对解决无家可归问题的必要性表示赞赏。
 但我对这样做的方式感到震惊。
 你知道，我们这些住在圣路易斯的人。
 弗朗西斯科街 S.
 克莱尔今天实际上已经发现了这一点。
 你知道，这是一种既成事实的呈现。
 显然，我们在准备和演示方面付出了很多努力。
 所以，
 我只想回应我的邻居琳达、李、玛吉、怀曼和其他人所说的话。
 今晚有两件事。
 一是它在停车、安全、对教堂、圣约翰教堂的影响方面。
 阿西西的方济各。
 这也是我们搬到这里的部分原因。
 这是一座美丽的教堂，就在我们家后面。
 交通、水，还有很多东西似乎没有考虑到。
 另一部分是有很多未知数。
 有人谈到，这是私有方式还是公共方式？
 这可能会影响事情。
 有人说这个非营利组织才成立三个月。
 ADA 合规性。
 未知数太多，数据又不够。
 最后，我认为整个教育问题似乎都是虚假的。
 这似乎具有误导性，因为这似乎并不是光环之家的主要意图。
 如果人们能直接沟通，我会非常感激。
 如果我还没有读过这篇文章，出于所有所述原因，我完全反对这里发生这种情况。

 我叫马蒂尔德·塞斯塔。

 弗朗西斯街，就在修道院后面。
 我同意每个人所说的一切，但我认为这些人贪多嚼不烂。
 因为如果放40个人，也就是40个房间和孩子，他们就会像蚂蚁一样。
 到处。
 而且，我完全愿意帮助别人，只是不花我的钱。
 我在这里已经 45 年了，但最近我每天都得为停车而烦恼。
 因为我永远不能停下来半个小时回家然后再出去。
 我还要回去，上下10米。
 我已经 83 岁了，我需要这样做，因为我需要有人把车停在我家门前。
 首先，有了学校，就出现了这么多的居民。
 现在我们会有更多的人。
 现在他们说他们没有足够的汽车。
 不过，让我们稍后看看结果吧。
 我们现在不谈。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=6138.297s">[SPEAKER_31]</a>: 那么，玛丽亚到梅奥·帕洛米诺 172 Fulton Street, Medford，以及
 我非常担心会出现这样的事情，人们已经说过了，关于这个数量的人会如何影响这里的人口。
 在这个特定区域，富尔顿，圣。
 旧金山，旧金山
 克莱尔，非常非常非常紧。
 非常拥挤。
 正如迈克尔·鲁伊斯（Michael Ruiz）总是说的那样，停车是不可能的，尤其是在圣路易斯。
 弗朗西斯科街。
 富尔顿街没有停车场。
 然后还有私家路，但是这些人有私家路。
 它实际上就在我住的地方的街对面。
 所以我很担心停车情况、人数
 老实说，这座建筑前面几乎没有空间可以铺设人行道，因为那是教堂，对吗？
 如果发生某种事故、火灾、有人需要救护车，这些车辆将非常非常难以接近任何人。
 所以我觉得
 由于该计划在一侧显示了这一点，他们认为他们将在另一侧设置一个坡道。
 他们会种上很多很多的灌木和鲜花，一切都很漂亮。
 但说实话，似乎没有空间。
 因此，由于所有这些原因，人们已经公布了停车人口，那么停车人口是多少？
 特别是一些孩子，你知道，如果人们生病了，他们需要它，并且可能会发生火灾，那么这些车辆就没有足够的空间进入该房产。
 谢谢。</p>

 我住在辛克莱路 1 号。
 因此，我认为，首先，在听取了大家的意见后，这次听证会本身还为时过早。
 根据律师所说，抱歉，我忘记了他的名字，还有节目中的莱斯利，我认为很明显他们没有把所有的T都划掉，而我却这样做了。
 因此，他们的反应也很多。
 以及相当于“我相信这一点，我相信这一点，我不确定，这仍在讨论中”的陈述。
 这不是一个计划。
 这就像在喷泉里随意许下一个愿望，他们将其带到超过 100 人甚至更多的受影响社区。
 根据我迄今为止在他们的提案中听到和读到的内容，他们几乎介绍了这个半生不熟的计划，几乎没有经过深思熟虑。
 另外，我认为《多佛修正案》的整个使用是如此虚伪，以至于听到他们谈论它让我头晕。
 引用麦克莱恩的案例本身，上面提到的某人实际上坐落在绿地和数英亩的空间中，而不是在各个方向都距离房屋或住宅物业一臂之遥的地方，这就像是最好的独创性。
 除此之外，我只是想澄清一下
 首先，这是一个无家可归者收容所，它被包含在一家房地产公司的提案中，该公司试图从中获利，并以某种方式将其纳入多佛修正案中。
 我想凯文或佩恩之前可能已经提到过，同一家公司试图将同一栋建筑改造成豪华公寓，并与我们中的几个人联系，试图购买或租用自己的停车位。
 因此，我鼓励董事会真正深入研究该项目背后的动机，因为根据时间表，开发人员正在尝试做什么非常清楚。
 最让我困扰的部分是：
 你知道，作为一个在家庭暴力受害者之家由单亲母亲抚养长大的人，看到这个提案有点令人作呕，他们如何改变自己的立场，从豪华公寓转向试图展示、引用、出于教育目的的无家可归者收容所。
 所以，你知道，我只是要求董事会收回这一点，并给我们更多的时间和更多的会议时间，以便在做出决定之前更多地考虑它并更详细地考虑。
 谢谢。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=6425.48s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢阿莉达，也谢谢你的脆弱的评论。

 我住在 36 街。
 弗朗西斯科街。
 我是昨天从邻居那里得知的。
 作为邻居，我不知道这种事会发生在我的邻居身上，这有点令人沮丧。
 所以，关于多佛修正案，我认为律师引用的说法似乎不对，说还有大约六个月的时间，但事实上他并没有引用一个教育计划，而是一个具体的计划，这是试图让这项修正案通过的目标。
 所以这部分令人沮丧，它主要是一个避难所。
 我担心我们的安全。
 潜在的 HALO 居民及其子女以及社区。
 此外，停车和拥堵也是该地区的一个主要问题。
 我还没有听说过任何关于客人或到访社区的消息，但肯定的是，对于一个有 40 个房间的住宅来说，该地区也可能会有大量的交通。
 所以我认为这里应该有一些额外的考虑。
 似乎并不是所有的计划，甚至是建筑的计划，以及 ADA 合规性都经过深思熟虑。
 所以我认为我与社区成员有很多共同的担忧，我认为应该对此进行更多的考虑和更多的讨论。</p>

 我什至可以欣赏隔壁没有像近年来那样空荡荡的建筑。
 我什至可以欣赏那些寻求投资回报的开发商。

 但我想我会问一些问题。
 嗯，更加清晰一点，我很抱歉，我迟到了这次会议，我还没有恢复会议，但我认为开发人员可以更加清晰和透明地了解这是否是一直以来的意图，或者
 本来是A计划，但无法完成，现在B计划是试图从购买隔壁大楼的投资中获得一些回报。
 从这个意义上说，这似乎是一个尚未完善的计划，至少从我迄今为止在本次会议上听到的情况来看是这样。

 我接到了很多很多居民打来的电话，再次强调这一事业是崇高的，我认为没有人可以否认这一点。
 而是之前提出的呼吁，希望这对经常光顾该房产的人们的生活质量产生积极的影响。
 我认为我们居民的生活质量现在更加重要，因为我再次认为
 黄油方面缺乏沟通，也不了解正在发生的事情。
 所以我认为选举后这种速度真的让人们感到厌烦。
 我认为与我分享的居民最想问的问题是。
 交通研究并不是真正全面的交通研究。
 我认为这是城市必须参与的地方，我们必须要求我们的交通工程师实施一项计划，该计划不是来自试图开发该地区的人，而是来自我们的居民。
 我认为这很重要。
 我认为同样重要的是我们了解过去试图在这里引入什么以及为什么过去被拒绝，因为我认为过去停车问题是一个问题。
 再说一次，我失去了链接，所以如果有人提到这一点，我就有点晚了，但我们也在讨论总教区将如何处理教区长、餐厅、健身房，如果那样的话后来卖给了另一家公司。
 因此，我认为该计划没有经过居民的适当审查，他们也不了解其影响。
 现在，我承认，就像我说的，这是一项崇高的事业，但我认为这对于你们在一起时去那里的家庭非常有益。
 通往街道的大门，一个每周都有弥撒和葬礼的停车场。
 所以我认为我们作为一个社区应该考虑一些事情，如果可以的话，艾米丽，我想询问 CD 董事会我们是否可以尝试将其推迟到另一次会议事实上，为了透明起见，我认为这对于所有无法参与其中的居民来说很重要，因为他们最近才发现。
 我认为，为了公平对待所有涉及这将产生的影响的人，我认为有很多答案，特别是对交通的影响，你知道，我早些时候听到律师说，他谈到不会有人开车。
 这不是真的。
 我们知道这一点。
 我们知道这一点，我们需要更好地了解将会产生什么影响，特别是在该位置上方的邻居周围，因为确实没有停车位。
 我的意思是，我们看到了这一点，尤其是在有质量的情况下。
 话又说回来，这是一项崇高的事业。
 我，你知道，如果它像美沙酮配送中心一样，如果它在正确的地方，那将是一项崇高的事业。
 但我再次强调，我们确实必须分析我们的流量，以做出可行且明智的决策，然后确保当我们谈论每个人（即邻居）时，每个人都参与该决策。
 我再次感谢你们所做的所有辛勤工作。

 我觉得如果我们担心这个问题，也许我们没有真诚地讨论它。
 但是，你知道，我从我作为一名教师的职业生涯以及我与在家庭暴力庇护所工作的人们的个人经历中获得了信息。
 当儿童被安置在庇护所时，学生资助不属于接收区。
 避难所的居民往往是非常有爱心的邻居，并且非常尊重该地区，因为住在避难所的要求非常严格，他们显然需要在那里，否则他们不会在那里。
 没有人愿意呆在家庭暴力庇护所里。
 当然，还有一些重要的细节需要解决。
 我对瓦利德和其他人所说的感兴趣
 考虑到这个开发商的性质，似乎需要与附近的人进行更多的第一人称对话，包括邻居和稍远一点的人。
 鉴于更广泛的政治格局中正在发生的事情的不确定性，我们中的许多人，特别是今天和昨天之后，都关心如何在地方层面上互相照顾，而不是
 我们的做法是不断在其他社区推广服务和关怀社区的方式。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7638.365s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢。
 嗯，丹妮尔或艾丽西亚，谁会欣赏你的评论？观众中有其他第一次评论的人吗？
 再说一次，如果我们鼓励所有评论，您知道，有一个电子邮件地址，您可以在其中分享聊天中发布的评论。
 呃，所以我们鼓励每个人通过该电子邮件地址分享您的反馈。
 如果您还有其他意见并且已经发言。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7667.12s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: 我没有看到今晚没有发言的人举手。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7673.223s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 出色地。
 谢谢你，丹妮拉。
 此时，我们将结束本次会议的公众评议期。
 我想给申请人一个回应或机会来回应一些已经提出的意见，因为我知道有大量的意见。
 我们希望听到一些想法的回应。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=7703.687s">[Mike Ross]</a>: 好的，我会尽力的。
 首先，这个团队并不是之前来这座城市提出豪华公寓的团队。
 所以我不知道那个团队是否改变了主意并说，好吧，在这种情况下，让我们做一个清醒的房子或者让我们做
 避难所或他们去的任何地方，那不是你面前的人。
 这是一位前任索赔人，他将房产卖给了我的客户。
 我的客户即将到来，这是他们的第一个提案，因此任何针对他们的敌意，过去几分钟内对他们提出的一些评论，最重要的是，不幸且不准确。
 其次，我想就有关法律问题进行辩论。
 此次电话会议的参与者。
 但我认为这不是合适的论坛。
 我要给你们读一段引言，它可能会对我喜欢的一个案例中的人们有所帮助，而且我刚刚得到了这个案例。
 毫无疑问，教导人们如何处理日常问题并在社会中生存的基本知识
 一个教育过程。
 这就是为什么清醒的住宅在这里是合法用途的原因。
 看，我住在一个社区里。
 很久以前，我是一名议员。
 我们都生活在社区中。
 我们理解人们对周围环境的担忧。
 我们明白这一点。
 因此，这群人刻意去挨家挨户交谈。
 我很欣赏玛吉所说的。
 玛吉说她想更好地了解她的邻居。
 她希望这群人能够更好地了解他。
 这个小组同意。
 该小组希望更好地了解这个社区。
 我认为人们会发现英语中最危险的词是they。
 他们。
 当人们会发现什么
 她深入探讨了家庭暴力的话题，同时也分享了自己的经历，我们很感激就是这样。
 与此相关的人以及家人和朋友，他们将居住在该房产中。
 任何地方都没有这样的房产，因为人们不希望在他们的后院有一个无家可归者收容所。
 在这次会议之前，有人在不同的房屋上投下传单，并说请出现，以防止无家可归者收容所来到您的社区。
 现在我明白了，人们看到这个，他们很生气，他们认为有人试图对他们施加一些影响并破坏他们的社区。
 我的客户敲门、与邻居交谈并询问他们是否愿意，而不是因为我们需要停车位。
 因为人们认为我们需要停车位。
 你听说过最近成立了这家公司与我们合作的专业人士，这就是为什么这个实体在国务卿办公室里很新鲜，而不是因为我们制定了一些精心设计的计划来以某种方式欺骗这个电话的参与者
 以某种方式让新人进入这个空间，试图告诉他们，我们想假装我们想要建立一个家庭暴力庇护所，这样我们就可以转身并以某种方式穿过我们实际上正在尝试建造的梅德福市，什么，一个无家可归者收容所或建造豪华住房，但我们假装进来
 所以不，这里的情况并非如此。
 它拥有经验丰富的专业人士，他们从事这项工作数十年，从事这项工作数十年。
 Taisha 在这里为这个项目创建了一个实体 Halo House，作为服务这个社区的非营利实体。
 业主安德鲁·利奇菲尔德和史蒂夫·苏达
 其他类型此类住房的业主，以开发商的身份，自己拥有该房产，因此不会有与之相关的免税，即使租赁该空间的租户是非营利组织。
 这里的目标是
 改善这些人的生活，他们在许多情况下是生活在同一社区的人。
 让我尝试回答一些具体问题。
 我提到了财产税，它们将被支付。
 有人说我们隐藏了房间数量，原来是 40 间，现在是 37 间。
 正如我所说，共有 37 个房间和 3 个灵活房间，总共 40 个房间。
 这三个灵活的房间可以用作办公室。
 它们可以用作临时设施。
 它们可以用作灵活的安装空间。
 所以一共有40个房间。
 那个房间里会有多少人？
 好吧，如果你有一个母亲和一个婴儿，那就是两个人在同一个房间里。
 如果你有一个母亲，还有一个儿子，就像我之前说过的，如果那个儿子七八岁，那么这个儿子就会住在隔壁房间，他们之间会有一扇门。
 建筑物的全部容量是我们的建筑师和您的施工部门之间解决的过程。
 您的建筑部门根据我们的建筑师向您的建筑部门提供的建筑级别文件提供了法律允许的数量。
 建筑无障碍吗？
 当然是。
 我们必须遵守无障碍指南。
 我不知道，这是一项耗资超过百万美元的翻新工程，触发了一定程度的无障碍指南。
 我们的建筑师完全理解并理解了这一点。
 您所在大楼的员工都明白这一点。
 这有不同的层次。
 这座建筑将被彻底夷为平地。
 这些洒水装置将为消防员创建某种专业分类，而该建筑中目前尚不存在这种分类。
 无论这里是否需要电梯，如果由于某种残疾人通道、某些 AAA 要求、某些无障碍要求而需要电梯，那么我们就会在那里安装电梯。
 但我们的理解，我们的建筑师埃里克·扎切森（Eric Zacherson）非常好，他在马萨诸塞州做了很多工作，包括在波士顿市，
 他认为我们这个空间不需要电梯。
 否则我们就会穿上它们。
 我们建议通过在底层创建无障碍单元并进入底层的这些区域来实现无障碍指南。
 消防路线、与火灾有关的其他问题、灭火系统、改进我们的系统。
 所有这些事情都不是我们提议的。
 这些是马萨诸塞州建筑规范和消防规范提出并由您的建筑部门强制执行的内容。
 当然，我们必须遵守所有这些规定。
 但我认为这个问题的核心是使用问题。
 当我的客户敲开一些邻居的门说：看，你们有这个空包裹吗？
 你愿意租吗？
 这是一个公平的问题。
 这次会议他们问我们，他们在这次会议上告诉我们，这都是交通问题，这都是停车和交通问题，尽管我们告诉他们，根据我们的专业经验，我们的客户没有车，也没有带车。
 但我们看到了拥有三四个空间的价值。
 如果有的话那就太好了。
 我们这个包里没有这个。
 牧师或修女的包裹里没有这个。
 是的，他们没有开车去某个地方，但他们有人来帮助他们在设施周围做事。
 拥有它就太好了。
 我们得到的答案是，如果我们同意建造豪华公寓，我们就会获得停车位。
 如果我们要建造豪华公寓，那么是的，可以达成协议来创建停车位，并将这些停车位用于该设施。
 但人们不希望他们附近有无家可归者收容所。
 这就是问题所在。
 这就是我们所听到的。
 我认为很容易说这是一个无家可归者收容所，并用它来污蔑这里提出的建议。
 这正是
 这就是为什么我们制定《多佛修正案》等法律来防止此类使用，因为使用通常会带来偏见。
 孩子们会上学还是必须上学？
 在家里要有礼貌。
 孩子们将有机会进入学校系统。
 如果孩子想要，如果父母想要在家教育他们，那些父母对吗？
 当然是。
 这个社区有公园。
 希基公园是附近的一个公园。
 这是这些孩子最有可能去的地方并受到适当的监督。
 事实上，由于该设施拥有的资源，在许多情况下，他们将受到更好的监督，而不是在住房不足或养育不足的情况下。
 他们是美国人还是非法的？
 这个国家现在的需要是为受虐待的妇女及其子女提供资源。
 我怀疑这种需求是全球性的需求。
 我会让露丝和塔夏莎完成这个问题，回答这个问题。
 没有人会被赶下公交车。
 如果市政府不希望我们在圣路易斯提供人行道
 克莱尔，我们不会在圣克莱尔街提供人行道。
 克拉拉。
 该公寓没有在圣路易斯提供人行道。
 克拉拉。
 所以我认为这种家庭暴力
 呃，资源，你知道你不想投资比你需要的更多的钱，也不应该投资，不要在圣路易斯建造人行道是可以的。
 克莱尔，如果这是城市希望我们做的，我们会遵守城市要求我们做的一切，他们希望我们做消防车道，所以那里可以有消防车道，也有一定的要求，我们并不是建议我们取消。
 防火罩或消防栓，当然我们会完全遵守所有这些要求。
 我认为这涵盖了
 尤其是异地工作。
 没有人会尝试在圣路易斯进行商业驾驶。
 克莱尔和其他小巷。
 在许多这样的工作目的地，太阳能电池板，以及其他类似的东西，这就是我们拥有渡轮的原因。
 人们将登上渡轮并被带到这些资源。
 并非所有资源都能到达我们手中。
 很多很多。
 但像这样的事情
 您将不会学习在该社区附近的街道上驾驶商用车辆。
 它们将在我们派遣人员的异地设施中完成。
 我想，Tay，你应该把这段对话放在聊天评论中。
 最后，如果可以的话，让我把它交给露丝，或者交给塔夏莎来回应，因为这是你一生的工作。
 他们告诉你，你只是认为这是一个骗局。
 我很抱歉不得不听到这个消息。
 我认为你有权得到答案。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8469.678s">[Taisha Gishard]</a>: 那么，露丝，你想领导吗？
 我绝对知道我一直在处理什么
 并庇护了数百人。
 我创建这个非营利组织的原因是因为这来自我的内心。
 我和很多人一起工作过，不得不处理这样的情况，最好为他们提供庇护，控制环境，让邻居知道我们在这里，我们关心他们。
 Não é um truque。
 我们什么也没做
 因为它是一个非营利组织，所以可以盈利。
 您不会通过非营利组织获利。
 即使我是租户，我也能得到折扣。
 相比之下，如果您甚至通过出租房产来赚取利润。
 来自非营利组织的一切都会回归到它。
 我与其他组织进行财务合作，成为我的财务赞助商和我的长期成功利率合作伙伴。
 这就是我带你来这里的原因。
 我已经接到露丝的电话，我会让她谈谈她多年来的经验，但我们并不想对梅德福市做任何事情。
 露丝，我会让你谈谈其他的事情。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8562.628s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: 是的，谢谢你们，也感谢你们所有人的证词。
 我只是，你知道，我正在接受这一切。
 我的名字是露丝·罗林斯。
 我与社区一起工作了 30 多年。
 我也是幸存者。
 25 年来，我一直是家庭暴力倡导者，并有机会管理家庭暴力庇护所并监督服务。
 我真的只是想保留空间
 感谢那些有勇气在这次呼吁中说出自己如何受到家庭暴力影响的人们。
 我祈祷这次电话会议中没有人或其任何家庭成员经历过家庭暴力。
 但我真的很想谈谈需求。
 马萨诸塞州 35% 的妇女和儿童一生中遭受过家庭暴力。
 我理解非常非常重要的担忧，对吧？
 但我听到的是，你知道，我会稍微退一步。
 过去两年，家庭暴力增加了两倍，服务数量增加了两倍，受家庭暴力影响的人数增加了两倍。
 有庇护所，但不幸的是，今天我不想成为逃离马萨诸塞州家庭暴力的人。
 因为移民身份，因为虐待女性，因为虐待男性，因为 LGBTQ 虐待，你知道，
 而且能够支持这些家庭的庇护所非常有限，甚至连人们可以进入的酒店都没有。
 所以需求是存在的。
 对我来说，有很多谈话，我怀着应有的尊重说这些，不是在我的后院，不是在我的后院。
 但我们可以成为人民，我们永远不知道家庭暴力何时会敲响我们的门，我们希望为我们的家人提供我们所需的同样支持。
 所以我只是想分享这个。
 在处理家庭暴力时，安全始终、始终、始终是最重要的因素。
 是写在石头上的吗？
 是不是已经很完美了？
 不。
 这始终是逃离虐待关系的人的安全以及居民的安全。
 因此，他们有一个完整的计划，我们将与梅德福警方合作，与其他能够支持这一计划的人合作，以便我们能够取得成功。
 关于服务，我的同事们有很多不同的说法。
 你知道，
 我们的服务和支持的第一个联系点是通过创伤知情护理来支持和教育这些逃离虐待关系的幸存者。
 也就是说，这是您的第一个联系人。
 所以，这可能是教育。
 后面可能有拖拉机。
 也许人们停在停车场？
 不。
 我们的任务是赋予他们权力，使他们能够足够稳定，为自己和孩子打破暴力循环。
 已经说了很多，我试图涵盖所有内容，但就程序而言，这取决于需要。
 这不公平，当我们谈论移民时，是的，这很糟糕。
 家庭暴力没有阴影。
 我只是想说这个，这是基于我多年的经验。
 没有影子。
 没有种族。
 我们的目标是支持家庭，从而打破暴力侵害儿童的恶性循环。
 完美吗？
 不，但需求确实存在。
 我要求你们对此进行调查，因为这涉及到为家庭暴力幸存者提供的服务。
 人们住在车里，人们无处可去，人们住在急诊室。
 所以肯定有需要。
 有一些事情需要修复吗？
 确实。
 这是一个为妇女和儿童服务的好机会吗？
 因此，如果我们真正关注家庭暴力或妇女庇护所，
 这是一个临时安置。
 目标是稳定他们并赋予他们权力，以便他们能够拥有长期住房。
 这就是所有节目、所有服务都将发挥作用的地方。
 所以我认为有很多担忧。
 但就我而言，我真正想做的是谈论需求。
 我不知道停车。
 看来是个大问题了。
 但我知道这种需要是存在的。
 这就是我真正想谈论的，安全和编程方面。
 所以，我的意思是，这就是我所拥有的一切。
 但我只知道我已经这样做很长时间了。
 我不想这么说，但我是怀着应有的尊重这么说的。
 我们在波士顿，许多 Method 人员来波士顿寻求服务。
 因此，如果我们不支持其他人，那对我们来说是一种耻辱。
 这对我来说是很珍贵的。
 这就是为什么我怀着敬意地说这句话。
 我怀着同情心说这句话，我祈祷这次电话会议中没有人遭受家庭暴力，也无处可去。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8886.446s">[Mike Ross]</a>: 嗯，主席女士，我在此暂停一下。
 我想我们已经给了你最好的了。
 有人提到了一扇门。
 没有大门可以通向任何人的财产。
 那不会发生。
 石棉，任何类似的东西，如果有的话，都必须经过专业处理。
 安德鲁·利奇菲尔德（Andrew Litchfield）、史蒂夫·苏伊达（Steve Suida），这就是他们所做的。
 他们从事房地产行业。
 他们一直在处理受损的建筑物。
 这就是他们所做的工作。
 有一个处理这个问题的过程。
 并将与梅德福建筑部门和适当的公共卫生机构以及其他一切部门一起妥善处理。
 主席女士，我在此暂停一下。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8925.414s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢迈克尔、露丝和塔莎。
 我很欣赏你的回复。
 我会把它交给亨特主任。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=8934.942s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 谢谢主席女士。
 实际上，我只是想向董事会分享一些其他信息。
 人们不会将其视为深思熟虑的一部分。
 我真的很想与公众分享这一点。
 我预计听到的担忧之一是对学校、交通和费用的担忧。
 于是我联系了我们的登记和运输总监。
 他还负责管理无家可归者到学校系统的所有交通。
 他说梅德福迫切需要庇护。
 她知道梅德福有家庭在沙发上冲浪，但他们不会在拥挤的情况下这样做。
 如果孩子没有危险，他们没有法律义务报告。
 但有些人确实可以从拥有更多的空间中受益匪浅，而不必像这样让两个或三个家庭住在一起。
 所以我问他这会对学校有何影响。
 他说，如果有学龄儿童无家可归，那么运作方式就是由父母决定
 如果他们希望孩子进入他们目前居住或流离失所的学校、社区的学校系统。
 假设此人居住在埃弗里特并且流离失所，因此家长可以请求安置在梅德福或埃弗里特。
 因此，如果有交通，如果他们最终来到梅德福，我就会像其他人一样成为一名普通学生，享受定期交通。
 如果是因为他们需要被运回某个地方
 如今有效的运作方式是，两个社区分担运送这些学生的费用（通常是货车），而国家则报销 80% 的费用。
 抱歉，她给我起了个法律，Wind之类的，但基本上他们报销了我们80%的运输费用。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9048.231s">[SPEAKER_12]</a>: 我只是把这个放在短信中。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9051.56s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 哦，太好了，谢谢。
 麦金尼-文托无家可归者援助法案。
 我认为居民应该了解这些信息，尽管这不是议会今晚要考虑的内容的一部分，因为我认为对此存在很多误解或错误信息。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9068.274s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢艾丽西亚。
 我认为作为董事会，我们有很多事情需要考虑。
 嗯，我认为 Halo House 可能是个好邻居。
 我相信参加这次电话会议的所有公众也都愿意成为好邻居。
 但据我所知，存在很多变数。
 这个问题需要解决，除了一些社区外展之外，你知道，除了要求停车位之外，这似乎是主要活动之一。
 我倾向于继续这一讨论，以留出更多时间，但我也想将其开放供理事会审议。
 我们正在考虑的两个问题是：这是否符合多佛修正案保护的教育用途？
 之后，该项目应适用哪些合理的规定？
 是否应批准所请求的停车要求和其他尺寸标准豁免？
 为了减轻要求豁免的任何不利影响，需要哪些批准条件？
 这样，我将向董事会开放。
 供辩论和审议。
 安妮、阿里、亚当、彼得。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9162.218s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: 我会大声思考，这可能很危险，但是
 我想我们做到了。
 我同意艾米丽刚才总结的许多事情。
 我认为有充分的理由证明这对我们的社区有利。
 我还清楚地听到，人们对实施细节存在很大的担忧。
 我认为
 这就是这样的董事会的作用：为候选人和社区创造机会并促进合作，做一些对每个人都互利的事情。
 因此，对我来说，继续保持这种联系来整理其中一些细节是有意义的。
 我也打开了它，但我无法阅读它，因为我正在听这个。
 作为本次讨论的一部分，
 这就像我试图对多佛修正案进行自己的调查一样。
 我不是律师，但我是研究馆员。
 到目前为止我们所了解到的似乎都是准确的，但我认为续集的好处之一是我们可以通过额外的研究来证实这一点。
 不，我想是的，我不想放弃这个项目，但显然还有很多关于如何让它发挥作用的讨论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9255.971s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: 谢谢你，阿里。
 我完全同意阿里的观点。
 我认为这是一个非常重要的项目，不要继续下去，这样我们就可以更深入地讨论该项目的某些方面。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9276.203s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 亚当.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9277.624s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: 是的，我想我也想强化这些想法，也许冒着大声说话的风险。
 我认为这就是迈克尔·罗斯的观点。
 你知道，像多佛修正案这样的修正案的目的是因为，你知道，这样的事情属于社区，很多时候会产生阻力。
 但我也认为社区的担忧是合理的。
 随着时间的推移，这种方法会在他们之间产生更好的信任感。
 即使不是律师，我认为考虑到之前的判例法，我们也应该进行尽职调查，以确保这属于多佛的管辖范围。
 我自己对此进行的研究以及仅查看过去的教育和庇护案例，似乎这可能属于多佛修正案的范围。
 但如果事情没有完成，续集就有意义，特别是，正如人们所说，我认为很多人在最后一天之后会感到愤怒。
 我们不想在累的时候做出决定。
 我们处于什么样的心情。
 然后我认为另一部分是社区外展和信任，我在不同的城市都经历过这种情况，这些城市靠近此类项目或设施。
 除了与他们在一起的非常积极的经历之外，我从未有过任何其他的经历。
 我认为他们发挥了非常有价值的作用。
 我认为，就像在场的人一样，我说，这些都是我们社区的成员，他们经常经历需要的时刻。
 你知道，最后一点，你知道，我个人认为，作为一名市议会成员，我现在还没有准备好真正谈论有关停车的所有战术问题，以及影响评估的类型和实际的例外情况。
 那里是如何完成的。
 我认为有用的是类似项目的更具体的例子，你知道，更具体一点，比如关于你可以预期多少流量的数据点。
 再次，从努力中，我想到了相互信任。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9454.315s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 看来Peter也在线了。
 他是一部iPhone。
 我会尝试找到他并请他关掉声音。
 我看到了 iPhone 5。
 我们将获得参与者名单。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9478.641s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 有一部 iPhone 和一部客用 iPhone 5。

 出色地。
 好吧，抱歉，我不得不更换设备。

 很多担忧。
 我认为，特别是在维度方面，需要进行真正的分析，以确保我们了解我们正在投票的内容，以及我们希望批准的内容。
 所以我...好吧，我想
 至少我晚上早些时候提出的有关债务和适用性的问题得到了解答。
 我认为，考虑到其他成员的担忧，目前继续进行的任何事情都是有效的。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9568.701s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 然后，</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9571.171s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: 议长女士，董事会成员之一呼吁投票或提出动议投票赞成休会是否合适？
 我认为我们需要先确定一个日期。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9582.745s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 好的。
 需要明确的是，您必须继续直到某个日期和时间。
 因此，我建议与候选人进行谈判，以便每个人都可以出席。
 我认为如果我们能够列出一些我们希望看到届时发生的事情将会很有帮助。
 好的。
 我想说的是，我们对流量的评论是基于它是私人的这一事实。
 我认为我们需要弄清楚如何协调彼得拥有的状态信息。
 我们邀请您通过我们的交通和工程部门掌握的本地信息与我们线下联系。
 因为这确实对我们可以并且应该向他们提出什么要求（无论是公开还是私下）产生影响。
 很抱歉我们今晚无法和好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9639.797s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 因此，也许我们可以总结我们想要继续的信息，以便请求者能够了解范围。
 然后我们可以讨论日期。
 所以我认为我们仍在议会审议中。
 丹妮尔，我们应该打开 Word 文档来开始撰写主题吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9667.145s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: 我失去了思路。
 我很累。
 我想说的是，无论发生什么，如果我们正在寻找人行道的解决方案，我会
 你知道，最终确定计划是因为很难对需要出现在计划中的事情设定条件，因为这样就可以解释并且难以执行。
 因此，我要补充一点，下次会议将会非常忙碌。
 我们面临着困难的风暴场地规划审查以及神秘大道市中心区的分区变更。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9711.718s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 这次会议的日期是哪一天？</p>

 一切都好。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9728.436s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: 我认为12月4日播放。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9731.722s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我们需要候选人确认他们的空闲时间。
 我还认为最好在下次会议中捕获我们想要的信息范围，以便他们了解，你知道，这是一座山吗？
 它是一粒沙子吗？
 他们需要多长时间？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9748.215s">[Mike Ross]</a>: 因此，我们小组很乐意参加 12 月 4 日的会议作为安全日期。

 我认为提出了合理的意见。
 我认为也有人提出了一些不合法的评论。
 我认为我们必须诚实地对待这一点。
 因此，我想确保我们被要求做的事情符合我们作为特定用途申请人的权利。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9800.916s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 是的，我们对该委员会有明确的授权。
 有些项目在我们的管辖范围内，而另一些则不在我们的管辖范围内。
 这就是为什么最好保持在这些限制之内。
 这是你作为候选人的权利。
 因此，我们将作为您作为候选人以及梅德福公民的顾问履行这一职责。
 作为规划委员会。
 我刚刚有一个问题。
 我们可以通过电子邮件发送更多问题吗？
 是的，请发送任何问题、任何意见。
 我们欢迎并鼓励您，并感谢大家保持在线状态并为该项目提供您的专业知识。

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9851.124s">[Peter Calves]</a>: 是的，所以我正在做我的第三次
 这里有关于它的职责。
 我有一份条件清单。
 丹妮尔说了一些关于最终确定项目计划以及我们想要确认圣路易斯管辖权的事情。
 克莱尔街以及这对交通可能产生的影响。
 议员们在接下来的两天里还希望看到什么其他条件吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9893.753s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 同样，我们的法规可能涉及停车要求、其他尺寸标准，以及减轻豁免要求的任何不利影响所必需的任何批准条件。
 这捕获了其中的很大一部分。
 我还建议申请人也许解决一些超出本论坛范围的事情，特别是如果有照片、地图或其他内容其他信息将有助于观众理解您对这些问题的一些答案。
 我认为，如果适用的话，这对未来的睦邻关系是非常有利的。
 我通过聊天收到了一个问题，这是
 如果 12 月 4 日的会议也是面向社区和居民，则可能需要将其带到市政府，或者可能属于市议会的职权范围。
 会议始终向社区和居民开放，但我理解可能希望就此事发表更多评论。
 是这个问题吗？
 是的，好的。
 我们可以再进行一次公众评议期吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=9975.735s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 主席女士，对于特别长、大或有争议的主题，您通常会说您希望将公众评论限制在本次会议上未讨论的主题上。
 所以如果他们提出新的信息、新的事物，公众可以评论，但不会有任何评论。
 这是董事会听到今晚已经发表的相同评论的原因。他们应该限制对新信息的评论。我认为如果人们觉得今晚无法发言，这也可以得到控制。但他们想呼应这里发生的事情。请给我们发电子邮件，董事会会告诉您还有更多志同道合的人。
 是的，但我们不会听到 10 个人一遍又一遍地说同样的话。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10032.739s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 澄清一下，今晚听到观众的情绪回应确实很有帮助。
 因此，我们非常感谢人们与我们联系并分享他们的评论、知识和经验，同时候选人也分享了他们对该网站的愿景。
 所以是的
 一是，是的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10060.842s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: 另一个问题。
 我们有多佛修正案，我认为它包括政府和彼得所说的话。
 我认为有一个公众评论，这也是一个有效的评论。
 获得律师的意见是件好事，但我认为作为董事会成员，最好看看判例法或文件本身的例子，独立地对它们进行三角测量，以便我们作为董事会也同意律师的意见。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10099.908s">[SPEAKER_39]</a>: 呃，除非我们也是文件，我的意思是，议长女士，我很抱歉不按顺序打断你的话，但是，嗯，呃，你知道我们有 24 页的请愿书，嗯，你知道，将其中一部分作为证据，这是我们提供给到达的理事会的一封信。我肯定错过了考试，抱歉，但也许我会注意的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10128.928s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: 对于 12 月 4 日的会议，董事会应明确审查背景文件。
 我很抱歉，迈克尔。
 具体展览我没看到。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10143.399s">[Mike Ross]</a>: 还有九页的波士顿奥尼尔报告。
 正如有人评论的那样，这不仅仅是一个小问题。
 所以材料的数量还是比较充足的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10154.608s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢。
 我刚刚看到另一条关于社区需要多长时间审查材料的评论。
 我们遵守公开会议的法律规定，因此我相信所有会议通知都会在会议前 48 小时发布。
 然后我们分享链接
 让我看看能不能把它弄出来。
 提交的申请人信息的链接。
 然后我就可以把它放回去了。
 哦，我没有，因为我离开了又回来了。
 艾丽西亚，你能把那个链接放回去吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10203.573s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 是的。
 主席女士，有两点。
 首先，如果董事会愿意，我可以要求我们的律师提供正式的书面意见。
 关于本案中的问题，关于它是多佛的事实。
 另一个是业主安德鲁·利奇菲尔德（Andrew Litchfield）和史蒂夫·苏达（Steve Suda）愿意与公众分享他们的联系信息，因为当他们敲门时，他们说很多人都没有回应。
 所以我会将其留在此处的聊天中。
 但实际上，如果他们愿意，我会将其与公共文件、所有者的联系信息一起放入一个小 Word 文档中，如果他们希望我们也这样做，以便人们可以联系他们。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10253.875s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 是的，我是披露此信息的请求者，并愿意直接倾听公众的声音。
 我鼓励您与市工作人员和议会分享任何意见或进展。
 好的，太好了。
 感谢艾丽西亚允许我们这样做。
 我收到了另一个问题。
 下次会议是在 12 月 4 日吗？
 这是我们建议继续的日期。
 我们必须提出正式动议。
 看来上诉人支持这一日期。
 见状有些点头。
 安妮，你有什么意见吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10298.307s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: 不，我很乐意提出这项动议。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10301.77s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10304.138s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: 我想提出一项动议，要求我们在12月4日继续讨论这个非常重要的话题。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10314.206s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我们还有第二次吗？
 我将是第二个。
 谢谢你，佩德罗。
 因此，我们面前的动议是继续执行该文件。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10333.204s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: 关于 空心屋 的讨论？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10337.045s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 继续在 21 St 进行讨论。
 克莱尔路 (Clair Road)，对多佛修正案进行场地规划审查，在不影响使用的情况下使用至 12 月 4 日。
 让我们进行点名投票。
 杰基·麦克弗森？
 佩德罗·贝泽罗斯？
 是的。
 阿里·佩克斯曼。
 是的。
 萨布丽娜·阿尔皮诺
 亚当·贝伦斯.</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10373.074s">[Peter Calves]</a>: 机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10374.256s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 安妮·斯特朗.
 是的。
 本·拉维尔.
 是的。
 我，艾米丽·赫德曼，是连续性的支持者。
 我在聊天中看到更多评论。
 我鼓励公众将这些意见提交到 TOC 网站或直接与申请人分享。
 他们提出了非常慷慨的报价。
 因此，我鼓励公众遵循这两种方法。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10409.103s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: 对不起艾米丽，只是澄清一下。
 在艾丽西亚共享的 Google 云端硬盘中，我认为我查看的是 Google 云端硬盘，但无法找到迈克尔正在谈论的多佛修正案文件。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10431.38s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 为什么我们不能处理该内容？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10438.075s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: 嗯，我只是想引起注意，因为这似乎也是公众感兴趣的事情。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10442.436s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 是的。
 是的。
 是的，最好澄清这一点。
 感谢您提到这一点。
 那么，我们将在 12 月 4 日看到 21 St Clair 的候选人。
 我们感谢所有公众参与公开听证会。
 这意味着很多。
 这是参与本地活动的好方法。
 所以谢谢你。
 我们将继续讨论议程上的下一个项目，即会议记录的批准。
 让我们继续这个有趣的讨论。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10476.012s">[Richard Raso]</a>: 谢谢大家。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10478.714s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢。
 因此，请问各位委员对2024年10月9日会议纪要草案有何意见或修改建议？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10492.148s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: 我不是。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10492.688s">[Unidentified]</a>: 不。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10497.549s">[Ari Fishman]</a>: 我建议接受他们。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10498.509s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我们还有第二次吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10501.55s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: 我第二。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10503.19s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 谢谢。
 因此，我们面前的议案是批准 2024 年 10 月 9 日会议的董事会会议记录。
 让我们进行点名投票。
 我会一边看着屏幕上的人一边做这件事。
 安妮·斯特朗.
 得到正式认可的。
 亚当·贝伦斯.
 通过了，是的，Peter 叫批准了，Fishman 批准了，董事会其他成员都缺席了，我应该查一下他们的名字吗？不，好的，太好了，谢谢。我们议程上的下一步是分区更新。规划团队是否有任何分区更新想与我们分享？
 快到10点了。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10553.95s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 我几乎太累了，无法做这件事。
 11 月 20 日是公开听证会。
 如果您想提前与我一起回顾其中任何内容，我很乐意这样做。
 我们还预计 12 月将努力推动塞勒姆街的快速发展。
 所以，我想这对你来说都不是新闻。
 您将看到它仅包含一行，该行应具有绿色分数。
 我们仍在与顾问一起制定绿色评分的细节。
 所以这或多或少会在事后发生，但也会在 12 月很快发生。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10594.675s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: 这只是神秘大道吗，艾丽西亚？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10597.996s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 这是对神秘大道的彻底重新分区。它还包括我们以前在分区中从未使用过的定义。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10605.339s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: 你想让我给你发一个链接吗？在CD面板文件中，您可以找到新的神秘大道走廊区的语言以及地图。
 以及公开听证会的记录。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10624.951s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: Adam，不是他与公众分享的 Google 云端硬盘，而是 Danielle 电子邮件中也包含的 Google 云端硬盘。
 是的，我有。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10636.535s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: 这就是我去过的地方，丹妮尔发送的内容以及她......</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10645.236s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: 有公共记录，还有我向董事会提供的一些东西，例如初步条件、员工备忘录以及非申请材料的东西。
 因此，要准备会议，请查看我发送的文件夹。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10665.054s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: 但是哦，所以我没有创建它。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10671.275s">[Danielle Evans]</a>: 我还没有为下次会议创建文件夹。
 因此，这将是市政厅演讲中的公众，因为通知是今天发布的，因此所有这些都必须被披露。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10686.139s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 出色的。
 还有别的生意吗？
 我收到了另一个问题。
 当录音发布后，我们会发布这些录音吗？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10704.581s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 这是电视直播的。
 好的。
 因此，需要一段时间才能渲染然后出现在 MCM 网站上。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10713.786s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 好的。
 这就是梅德福社区媒体。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10720.269s">[Alicia Hunt]</a>: 是的，这是 MedfordTV.org。
 好的。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10724.248s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 太好了，谢谢艾丽西亚。
 那么如果没有其他事情要讨论的话，我们可以休会吗？
 我建议会议结束。
 我第二。
 谢谢。
 我会按照屏幕上看到的那样去做。
 因此，摆在我们面前的动议是推迟11月6日的会议。
 这将是唱名投票。
 安妮·斯特朗？
 是的。
 亚当·贝伦斯？</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10753.655s">[Ayni Strang]</a>: 机会。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10754.893s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 佩德罗警察。
 一、你是鱼人吗？
 我。我是李，我有一个男人，也有一个我，我意识到也许我不是批准会议记录的人。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10769.677s">[Adam Behrens]</a>: 他没有那样做。</p>

    <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FsCuJDIgIlM&t=10770.657s">[Emily Hedeman]</a>: 我不是。
 我也是。好吧，我为此而死。
 我们现在可以讨论这个了。
 我们有这个。
 是的。
 好的，谢谢董事会成员。
 谢谢各位市民、市政府工作人员。
 这是一次非常非常有意义的会议，我感谢大家今晚的精力和努力。
 祝你有个美好的夜晚，照顾好自己。
 晚安。</p>
