1
00:00:00,372 --> 00:00:06,483
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening, everyone, and welcome to this evening's meeting of the Medford Community Development Board.

2
00:00:07,264 --> 00:00:11,713
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to call the meeting to order, and let's start with some obligatory procedural matters.

3
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:17,806
[SPEAKER_22]: This hearing of the Medford Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

4
00:00:18,487 --> 00:00:29,878

00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:27,645

12
00:01:31,274 --> 00:01:31,574

13
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:34,136
[SPEAKER_22]: Ari Fishman.

14
00:01:34,756 --> 00:01:35,136
[SPEAKER_22]: Present.

15
00:01:36,657 --> 00:01:37,538
[SPEAKER_22]: Sabrina Alpino.

16
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,800
[SPEAKER_22]: Adam Behrens.

17
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:43,802
[SPEAKER_29]: Here.

18
00:01:45,162 --> 00:01:45,783
[SPEAKER_22]: Annie String.

19
00:01:46,403 --> 00:01:46,844
[SPEAKER_29]: Present.

20
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:49,305
[SPEAKER_22]: Ben LaValle.

21
00:01:52,987 --> 00:02:00,592
[SPEAKER_22]: And myself, Emily Hedeman, standing in as chair while our fearless leader, Jackie McPherson, is unavailable this evening.

22
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:04,713
[SPEAKER_22]: Danielle, can you please introduce any staff on the call?

23
00:02:07,214 --> 00:02:18,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, myself, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner in the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, and also Alicia Hunt, the Director of Planning, Development and Sustainability is in attendance tonight.

24
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,801
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe that takes care of staff for tonight.

25
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:24,563
[SPEAKER_22]: Great, thank you.

26
00:02:26,748 --> 00:02:35,072
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, before we address our first agenda item, I'd like to recognize that our community development board and planning boards in general are not inherently political.

27
00:02:35,632 --> 00:02:44,216
[SPEAKER_22]: But with the events of the past 24 hours, I would be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the impact and importance of decisions that were made for our country and for our city.

28
00:02:45,362 --> 00:02:50,407
[SPEAKER_22]: Feelings like frustration, fear, anxiety, and sadness are widespread today.

29
00:02:50,427 --> 00:03:00,638
[SPEAKER_22]: It is our responsibility as a board to work within our mandate to support and advocate for those whose residents, relationships, bodily autonomy, or identity are at risk.

30
00:03:01,828 --> 00:03:08,049
[SPEAKER_22]: When politics on a national level feels really overwhelming, we can turn to our own communities to improve life at a local level.

31
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:23,353
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm so proud to serve on the Community Development Board and so proud of my fellow board members, and I encourage everyone who has the privilege and capacity to serve their community to do what they can, whether it's a donation of time, money, or compassion.

32
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:25,740
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm also so proud of Medford.

33
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:34,626
[SPEAKER_22]: Our city saw about 67% voter turnout and largely supported candidates and causes that are in service of our neighbors, our community, and Medford's future.

34
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:44,754
[SPEAKER_22]: Now let's dig into our meeting agenda and fulfill our board's mission to guide growth and development in a coordinated and comprehensive manner for all that call Medford home.

35
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:46,235
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

36
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:53,043
[SPEAKER_22]: So our first agenda item tonight is a public hearing for 21 St.

37
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:53,644
[SPEAKER_22]: Clair Road.

38
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:57,407
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a site plan review for a Dover amendment use.

39
00:03:58,388 --> 00:03:59,910
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to read the public hearing notice.

40
00:04:01,431 --> 00:04:05,575
[SPEAKER_22]: The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on November 6, 2024.

41
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:09,266
[SPEAKER_22]: After 6.30 p.m.

42
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:21,911
[SPEAKER_22]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review submitted by Assisi Holdings LLC to renovate an existing four-story, 12,930-square-foot building at 21 St.

43
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:25,653
[SPEAKER_22]: Clair Road, Medford, MA 02155 associated with a proposed 40-room shelter for women and children.

44
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:46,769
[SPEAKER_22]: This project is subject to site plan review for Dover Amendment uses per the Medford Zoning Ordinance Section 94-11-8 and requires approval from the Community Development Board.

45
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,632
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to ask the staff for any introductory remarks.

46
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

47
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, Danielle Evans, Senior Planner.

48
00:05:00,093 --> 00:05:05,738
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to kind of provide some background to what's before you.

49
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:18,208
[SPEAKER_14]: As the Chair mentioned, this is a Dover Amendment use, which is for uses that are protected under Chapter 48, Section 3, known as the Dover Amendment.

50
00:05:18,228 --> 00:05:20,490
[SPEAKER_14]: So it affords protections to certain uses.

51
00:05:21,177 --> 00:05:32,429
[SPEAKER_14]: In this case an educational use that exempts them from certain requirements of the zoning ordinance such as where they can locate and how relief can be granted from requirements like dimensional standards and parking requirements.

52
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,352
[SPEAKER_14]: So the scope of the site plan review is more narrow.

53
00:05:35,772 --> 00:05:37,694
[SPEAKER_14]: So the board is limited to two inquiries.

54
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,357
[SPEAKER_14]: And the first question.

55
00:05:41,378 --> 00:05:44,939
[SPEAKER_14]: to be answered is does the use qualify for protection under the Dover Amendment?

56
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:58,801
[SPEAKER_14]: And second, what are the reasonable regulations concerning the bulk and height of the structures and determining yard sizes, lot areas, setbacks, open space, parking, and building coverage requirements of any should be imposed on the use?

57
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:10,563
[SPEAKER_14]: The board's allowable actions tonight are to approve, approve with conditions, or deny, but you can only deny for failure to provide necessary information.

58
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:21,215
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted to set the table and let folks know what is within the board's review and powers tonight.

59
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:22,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

60
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:29,037
[SPEAKER_22]: Great, that's really helpful to help us set expectations as we discuss with the board and we engage in the public hearing.

61
00:06:29,777 --> 00:06:37,740
[SPEAKER_22]: And we can go back and remind ourselves of those kind of extents throughout our discussion as well.

62
00:06:39,077 --> 00:06:43,840
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to ask the applicant to present their application.

63
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,542
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we have a member of the applicant's team available this evening?

64
00:06:52,645 --> 00:06:53,985
[SPEAKER_22]: I see Michael Ross.

65
00:06:58,528 --> 00:06:58,748
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

66
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:00,549
[SPEAKER_22]: Other members of your team?

67
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,930
[SPEAKER_40]: There will be, yes.

68
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:05,912
[SPEAKER_40]: I can introduce them, Madam Chair, if that's okay.

69
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:12,289
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I just want to make sure that they are able to speak and or share, uh, share screen.

70
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:13,610
[SPEAKER_22]: I see some hands coming up.

71
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,971
[SPEAKER_22]: Leslie Creedle.

72
00:07:17,233 --> 00:07:18,514
[SPEAKER_40]: Can help you with the other names.

73
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:29,141
[SPEAKER_40]: We have Taisha Richard, Leslie Creedle, Ruth Rollins, uh, and our principals tonight are Andrew Litchfield and Steven Sweater.

74
00:07:29,942 --> 00:07:30,122
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

75
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:35,275
[SPEAKER_40]: I also have my associate here as well, Maggie Roberts.

76
00:07:35,776 --> 00:07:39,942
[SPEAKER_40]: I was gonna present and not everyone's gonna speak, but you know, there might be a comment.

77
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:41,845
[SPEAKER_22]: That sounds great.

78
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:43,949
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you able to share screen?

79
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,331
[SPEAKER_40]: Can I do that?

80
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:45,811
[SPEAKER_40]: Is that all right?

81
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:47,419
[SPEAKER_22]: Maybe?

82
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,060
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, yes, you can do it.

83
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,842
[SPEAKER_22]: But technically, we may have to troubleshoot a bit.

84
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:52,582
[SPEAKER_40]: May I?

85
00:07:52,702 --> 00:07:52,962
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

86
00:07:52,982 --> 00:07:54,243
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we got it.

87
00:07:54,263 --> 00:07:55,684
[SPEAKER_40]: I can see your screen.

88
00:07:55,744 --> 00:07:55,804
[SPEAKER_40]: OK.

89
00:07:56,004 --> 00:07:56,184
[SPEAKER_40]: All right.

90
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:57,465
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, my name is Mike Ross.

91
00:07:57,505 --> 00:08:02,568
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm an attorney with the law firm of Prince Lobel, and I'm representing the applicant tonight.

92
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:08,211
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you for having me here, Madam Chair, members of the board, and for your comments thus far.

93
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:13,895
[SPEAKER_40]: And also for Daniel Evans for setting the table, really

94
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:17,418
[SPEAKER_40]: really well, just there.

95
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:24,285
[SPEAKER_40]: We are here on a site plan review, as Danielle mentioned, for 21 St.

96
00:08:24,325 --> 00:08:26,527
[SPEAKER_40]: Clair Road, and this is a photo of it.

97
00:08:27,873 --> 00:08:30,695
[SPEAKER_40]: What we're proposing tonight is a women's and children's shelter.

98
00:08:31,536 --> 00:08:34,998
[SPEAKER_40]: And we have members of our team who are prepared to speak about that as well.

99
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,883
[SPEAKER_40]: But what I'm going to do is going to provide a high-level overview and then see if there are any questions.

100
00:08:42,224 --> 00:08:44,165
[SPEAKER_40]: So this is our team, essentially.

101
00:08:44,225 --> 00:08:49,929
[SPEAKER_40]: So Andrew Litchfield and Stephen Sveta comprise Assisi Holdings.

102
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,191
[SPEAKER_40]: These are two real estate

103
00:08:55,005 --> 00:09:13,700
[SPEAKER_40]: professionals who have a variety of portfolio of properties and within them properties that deal specifically with social services like the one we're proposing tonight, as well as other properties as well, market rate and the like.

104
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,141
[SPEAKER_40]: They had previously worked with one of our providers, and that's Taisha Gushard.

105
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:37,824
[SPEAKER_40]: And Taisha has worked with a number of non-profits within the state dealing with shelter care, but also specifically with what we're proposing here, domestic violent care, particularly for women and typically young children.

106
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:40,505
[SPEAKER_40]: Taisha has worked with

107
00:09:41,485 --> 00:09:43,866
[SPEAKER_40]: and her entity is called Pathway Alliance.

108
00:09:44,306 --> 00:09:48,187
[SPEAKER_40]: She has worked with an organization called Justice for Housing.

109
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:52,108
[SPEAKER_40]: Justice for Housing is here tonight, led by Leslie Creedle.

110
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:59,730
[SPEAKER_40]: And Leslie brought one of her colleagues, Ruth Rollins, who does direct care, has been doing it for decades, I believe 30 years.

111
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:05,071
[SPEAKER_40]: So we have a real deep bench here to talk about the type of work we're doing, if that's what the board wants to hear about.

112
00:10:06,132 --> 00:10:11,862
[SPEAKER_40]: Not here tonight, but provided in the materials that we've submitted to the board.

113
00:10:13,194 --> 00:10:17,815
[SPEAKER_40]: is our engineer, Fasin O'Neill, who did a traffic review of the site.

114
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,916
[SPEAKER_40]: Our architect, Eric Zacherson, who provided the plans I'll share with you.

115
00:10:22,616 --> 00:10:25,917
[SPEAKER_40]: Landscape architect, MDLA.

116
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:30,618
[SPEAKER_40]: And then there's myself and Maggie from Prince Lopel.

117
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:37,800
[SPEAKER_40]: And what we're proposing is the use I mentioned, we're calling it Halo House.

118
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,301
[SPEAKER_40]: And as mentioned by Danielle,

119
00:10:43,762 --> 00:10:51,026
[SPEAKER_40]: The entitlement, the approval that we're seeking, site plan review is through the Dover Amendment that I'll walk through in a second.

120
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,629
[SPEAKER_40]: This is the site here at 21 St.

121
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:55,249
[SPEAKER_40]: Clair Road.

122
00:10:57,191 --> 00:11:05,976
[SPEAKER_40]: It's next to, perhaps you'll recall, a somewhat newish condo development across from the parish center.

123
00:11:07,137 --> 00:11:08,678
[SPEAKER_40]: It's sitting on a 5,396 square foot parcel.

124
00:11:12,688 --> 00:11:17,829
[SPEAKER_40]: with an existing gross square floor area of just under 13,000.

125
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:23,711
[SPEAKER_40]: Previously used as a convent and also listed as a boarding house.

126
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:32,993
[SPEAKER_40]: Previously, it was a religious use and I would suspect it also came under some form of Dover amendment.

127
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:42,859
[SPEAKER_40]: But it's interesting, I looked at the property and the land itself was already subdivided and predates the zoning code, which in Medford is fairly early, 1925.

128
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:43,039
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes.

129
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:44,760
[SPEAKER_40]: And this site is 1924.

130
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,443
[SPEAKER_40]: The building itself was improved on the property in

131
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:02,627
[SPEAKER_40]: 1956.

132
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:02,627
[SPEAKER_40]: And I just thought this was interesting.

133
00:12:02,967 --> 00:12:05,572
[SPEAKER_40]: The name of the road used to be called Love Lane.

134
00:12:07,277 --> 00:12:10,818
[SPEAKER_40]: I just saw that when I was grabbing the documents.

135
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,638
[SPEAKER_40]: This is the existing structure.

136
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,860
[SPEAKER_40]: As you can see, it sits really tight on the property line.

137
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,400
[SPEAKER_40]: There's not a lot of space.

138
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:31,203
[SPEAKER_40]: And one of the reasons why I went to the history of the site is that this is not a case where we're showing up and finding just an empty parcel of land and we could build anything there.

139
00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:36,224
[SPEAKER_40]: What we're dealing with is an existing condition that we're inheriting that has been in place

140
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:43,851
[SPEAKER_40]: as a building since 1956, as a parcel since 1925 or 1924.

141
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:53,780
[SPEAKER_40]: So we're taking an already subdivided, non-conforming structure, parcel, and trying to make a

142
00:12:57,107 --> 00:13:08,637
[SPEAKER_40]: a use of the parcel, but also very closely following in what was previously there, at least in use, in terms of the impact and what have you.

143
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:22,429
[SPEAKER_40]: So I also want to just point out that even though there is almost no land to work with around this parcel and in this building, what is there is not really

144
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:29,875
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't know, utilized to the fullest and to the best.

145
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:32,136
[SPEAKER_40]: I mean, you can see the side of the building there.

146
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:35,618
[SPEAKER_40]: It's kind of an area for trash toters to be stored.

147
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:38,119
[SPEAKER_40]: The front doesn't have any kind of plantings.

148
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:42,121
[SPEAKER_40]: As you can see, you don't see bushes or trees or anything around the site.

149
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:46,083
[SPEAKER_40]: So there are things you could do, but it's just a very tight site.

150
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:47,984
[SPEAKER_40]: And this is the front of it.

151
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:48,645
[SPEAKER_40]: There's also no

152
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:55,095
[SPEAKER_40]: Sidewalk on this parcel, which we're proposing to add in front of our building.

153
00:13:57,118 --> 00:14:00,303
[SPEAKER_40]: As you can see here again, this is the front of the building.

154
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:02,407
[SPEAKER_40]: And, you know, whether.

155
00:14:03,674 --> 00:14:07,696
[SPEAKER_40]: it goes to the sidewalk, when it goes to this road, formerly Love Road, now St.

156
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:17,922
[SPEAKER_40]: Clair, we received a report from the Public Works Department saying that this is a private road, and it may be, but everything we've seen says that this is a public road.

157
00:14:19,103 --> 00:14:27,368
[SPEAKER_40]: Medford's own street book lists it as a public road, and we did some other looking in the Registry of Deeds, and it was referenced as a public

158
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:31,529
[SPEAKER_40]: roadway by by recently developed projects.

159
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:42,052
[SPEAKER_40]: So, I mean, I didn't do the full title examination, we could, but it seems to me that is a public road, and would invite a sidewalk and and and parking in front.

160
00:14:45,854 --> 00:14:51,615
[SPEAKER_40]: This is the site plan, again, you can see how tight it is on that parcel really built out to the edge.

161
00:14:52,496 --> 00:14:54,136
[SPEAKER_40]: And yeah.

162
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,652
[SPEAKER_40]: So I'm going to show you these plans really quickly.

163
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:01,194
[SPEAKER_40]: This is the existing plans.

164
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:09,926
[SPEAKER_40]: The existing setup is a 27, 29 room, depending on how you count the rooms.

165
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:30,386
[SPEAKER_40]: former convent with these rear rooms, as you can see here, this community, this cafeteria on the first floor, this chapel on the second floor, this community room on the third floor.

166
00:15:30,406 --> 00:15:33,168
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, and that's the fourth floor.

167
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:38,451
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, as being kind of open spaces, and then you see this large, uh.

168
00:15:39,172 --> 00:15:43,515
[SPEAKER_40]: Classroom on the 2nd floor here, this is the existing conditions.

169
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:44,435
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay.

170
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:46,897
[SPEAKER_40]: And what we're going to be proposing, I'll show you in a moment here.

171
00:15:48,118 --> 00:15:54,442
[SPEAKER_40]: These are the existing elevations and again, I'm going to show you what we're proposing here in a moment.

172
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,902
[SPEAKER_40]: All right, here's what we're proposing.

173
00:15:57,342 --> 00:16:07,907
[SPEAKER_40]: So we took those back rooms, that classroom, and that chapel, and that other larger spaces, and are able to put rooms in those spaces.

174
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:13,070
[SPEAKER_40]: And then that classroom along the second floor, we're able to divide that.

175
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:19,471
[SPEAKER_40]: and create 37 rooms for this facility now.

176
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:23,253
[SPEAKER_40]: And as you can see, these rooms have adjoining doors.

177
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:31,855
[SPEAKER_40]: And the reason why they have adjoining doors is because many of our clients who will come to this facility may have young children.

178
00:16:33,016 --> 00:16:46,173
[SPEAKER_40]: You know typical age and we can talk more about this are toddlers but they might go all the way up into the to the young teens or teenagers but typically you'll see younger children with their mother.

179
00:16:47,334 --> 00:16:58,765
[SPEAKER_40]: And in such a case where you might have, say, you know, a brother and sister or two brothers or something, there might be what would be appropriate would be to have an adjoining room next to the mother's room.

180
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:01,187
[SPEAKER_40]: And that's what we can do with these configurations.

181
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:04,571
[SPEAKER_40]: There's a lot of flexibility for that with these various rooms.

182
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:07,414
[SPEAKER_40]: There's also a tremendous investment in this building.

183
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:18,986
[SPEAKER_40]: This building needs to be fully upgraded with all new systems, all new mechanicals, all new safety devices, and it needs new HVAC systems, new floorings, new

184
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:23,381
[SPEAKER_40]: a lot of renovation on the inside.

185
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:34,792
[SPEAKER_40]: We're predicting that the renovation costs will be 800 to a million dollars on the interior of this building, as well as some minor work to do on the exterior.

186
00:17:34,992 --> 00:17:37,815
[SPEAKER_40]: There is no change to the envelope of this building.

187
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:40,157
[SPEAKER_40]: The building is staying exactly the same.

188
00:17:41,358 --> 00:17:42,159
[SPEAKER_40]: On the fourth floor,

189
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:53,165
[SPEAKER_40]: Yes let me make one other point this first floor is really where all the education and classrooms and discussions and job training and.

190
00:17:54,265 --> 00:17:59,008
[SPEAKER_40]: even areas for children to play, will be used.

191
00:17:59,108 --> 00:18:04,471
[SPEAKER_40]: Lots of flex space, a lot of ability to use that first floor in that regard.

192
00:18:04,511 --> 00:18:12,715
[SPEAKER_40]: And then each floor has a corner room, which is a flex room in its own self that can be used as an office or as a

193
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:19,606
[SPEAKER_40]: Kind of alternative room, but it could also be used as a room if it's needed.

194
00:18:19,946 --> 00:18:21,348
[SPEAKER_40]: And that's on the floors.

195
00:18:21,908 --> 00:18:28,294
[SPEAKER_40]: Uh, 2, 3 and 4 room 14 room 27 and room 40. so those are 3 additional rooms.

196
00:18:29,094 --> 00:18:29,254
[SPEAKER_40]: Um.

197
00:18:30,135 --> 00:18:33,959
[SPEAKER_40]: So, we can talk more about the activities that occur there and then on the exterior of this.

198
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:36,500
[SPEAKER_40]: building, what are we going to do?

199
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:38,942
[SPEAKER_40]: We're going to remove the cross and the birds.

200
00:18:39,822 --> 00:18:46,346
[SPEAKER_40]: We will replace, we will, you know, point and repair the bricks, repair the windows, replace some if needed.

201
00:18:47,146 --> 00:18:51,589
[SPEAKER_40]: We'll be adding a signage to the front door that says Halo House.

202
00:18:52,169 --> 00:19:17,102
[SPEAKER_40]: you'll see there that there is a lift to be proposed on the front entry and really that's the only substantially noticeable change to the front and to the really to all the elevations of the building except for this is that right side of the building and then on the left side of the building what we'd like to do here based on some of the comments we've received from staff

203
00:19:17,822 --> 00:19:21,686
[SPEAKER_40]: Is to create a path of accessible travel here.

204
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:23,428
[SPEAKER_40]: So we have a redundant travel.

205
00:19:23,728 --> 00:19:32,377
[SPEAKER_40]: We have a lift in the front, but we also have a ramp along the side of the building at construction level drawings.

206
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:33,098
[SPEAKER_40]: We will.

207
00:19:34,317 --> 00:19:36,459
[SPEAKER_40]: have to do a little bit of work on this ramp.

208
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:45,045
[SPEAKER_40]: Ramps require a railing and they require a flat period for just a certain section of the ramp.

209
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:52,030
[SPEAKER_40]: Our architect will do that, but this was something that we at this level are just describing as a ramp.

210
00:19:53,652 --> 00:19:57,875
[SPEAKER_40]: And we'll have to flush it out a little bit more when we get to construction level drawings.

211
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:08,088
[SPEAKER_40]: Okay, and then landscaping, I mentioned that there's very sparse, not a lot of plantings or anything happening on the site here.

212
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:20,920
[SPEAKER_40]: We're proposing, I believe, over approximately 50 plantings, trees, bushes, and the like along the front of the building, along the sides of the building, and then creating spaces and areas for people to gather.

213
00:20:21,981 --> 00:20:26,085
[SPEAKER_40]: So that space on the right side where you saw the toters earlier and the garbage barrels.

214
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:39,089
[SPEAKER_40]: those would be replaced with an exterior area for guests, for clients to gather, to recreate, to sit, to have a cup of coffee, to do whatever.

215
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:42,470
[SPEAKER_40]: And then in the back, the same type of area there.

216
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:51,193
[SPEAKER_40]: Now, one thing we don't have here and we're talking about, and it's something that came from our caregiving team, is to create some sort of play space.

217
00:20:52,193 --> 00:20:59,675
[SPEAKER_40]: What we think we're gonna do is that area that you see is eight and nine there, that that would be turned into some play area for our kids.

218
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:04,216
[SPEAKER_40]: It's just basic kind of playground type equipment, nothing too sophisticated.

219
00:21:04,236 --> 00:21:09,537
[SPEAKER_40]: There's not a lot of space there, but we might incorporate that section five into it as well.

220
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:21,540
[SPEAKER_40]: That's a little bit of a change that we're proposing here based on some of the conversations we've had recently as we prepared to be ready for this hearing and having conversations with our team.

221
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:31,788
[SPEAKER_40]: And this is just some more detail that we'll be fencing that are mentioned on our site plan and are in the plans.

222
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:39,175
[SPEAKER_40]: And these are the types of bushes and trees and foliage and the like that we'll be planting.

223
00:21:40,863 --> 00:21:50,946
[SPEAKER_40]: So just, you know, in terms of the Dover Amendment, which is the name given to 40A section three, Daniel already mentioned it.

224
00:21:50,986 --> 00:21:52,806
[SPEAKER_40]: There's just two qualifications here.

225
00:21:52,986 --> 00:21:57,927
[SPEAKER_40]: One is the use, an accepted use under the Dover, under 40A3.

226
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:04,129
[SPEAKER_40]: And we submit that we are, we are a providing educational services.

227
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:08,430
[SPEAKER_40]: I can, I provided the, and then are we,

228
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:15,449
[SPEAKER_40]: Are we, what are the reasonable regulations concerning the structures themselves?

229
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:27,359
[SPEAKER_40]: And that section two, I said to you earlier, given the site, given the history of the site and given the plan, we are doing everything we can to make best use of it.

230
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:32,643
[SPEAKER_40]: We are not changing the size, the envelope of the site, if you will.

231
00:22:33,384 --> 00:22:36,347
[SPEAKER_40]: And we are working as best we can to utilize the entire site.

232
00:22:36,987 --> 00:22:41,331
[SPEAKER_40]: uh, within the confines of this pre-existing non-conformance structure and use.

233
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:54,184
[SPEAKER_40]: I provided a, uh, a more detailed, um, application with some, um, more detail on both of these points, uh, uh, prior to today's hearing.

234
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:56,827
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, but you know, um,

235
00:22:58,459 --> 00:23:09,932
[SPEAKER_40]: And I'm just kind of pulling from the language of 40A Section 3 of this nonprofit use that would be educating as an education component.

236
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:11,914
[SPEAKER_40]: And I go a little bit deeper.

237
00:23:13,102 --> 00:23:42,621
[SPEAKER_40]: To point out that, in fact, a use is essentially what we're providing a domestic violent shelter for women and children that's intended on providing life skills, job skills, some of just the very basic skills that people need to function and stand on their own is really the very essence of what an appropriate and acceptable use would be under the Dover Amendment.

238
00:23:46,984 --> 00:23:54,352
[SPEAKER_40]: I want to tell you a little bit about the Pathway Alliance group, Taisha's group, and they are all available for questions.

239
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,933
[SPEAKER_40]: I imagine you'll have some for them.

240
00:23:57,335 --> 00:24:01,899
[SPEAKER_40]: It's a really interesting group that I've gotten to know and meet through this process.

241
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,841
[SPEAKER_40]: They're dealing with

242
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,592
[SPEAKER_40]: So they have some very strict guidelines of their own.

243
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:22,440
[SPEAKER_40]: They see clients that are typically between six months and a year, and they do have a year as being the maximum time that they want to have any one resident staying in their facility.

244
00:24:23,221 --> 00:24:32,947
[SPEAKER_40]: And one of the things that I learned from Leslie, who's going to be working with this group, is that they've had tremendous success with

245
00:24:34,523 --> 00:24:37,984
[SPEAKER_40]: not seeing recidivism in their space.

246
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:55,110
[SPEAKER_40]: I think she has a 99% success rate, meaning that 99%, at least in the case of Leslie's efforts, clients have gone on to stable housing and not relapsed, which I think is a

247
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,732
[SPEAKER_40]: This is the work they do with their clients.

248
00:24:58,773 --> 00:25:08,380
[SPEAKER_40]: They spend a lot of time getting their clients to stand on their own two feet so they can go out and apply for and have permanent housing.

249
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:12,144
[SPEAKER_40]: And this is the work that they do with their clients on a regular basis.

250
00:25:12,204 --> 00:25:14,506
[SPEAKER_40]: So here with us today is Taisha from the

251
00:25:17,363 --> 00:25:31,100
[SPEAKER_40]: I guess the from the pathway entity and working now with Leslie from justice for housing and then Ruth Rollins has brought in was brought in by Leslie Ruth has her own entity that she works with called we are better together.

252
00:25:31,161 --> 00:25:33,644
[SPEAKER_40]: But Ruth also does direct service and has been in the.

253
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:37,787
[SPEAKER_40]: Has been in this, as I mentioned, for at least 30 years.

254
00:25:37,807 --> 00:25:43,309
[SPEAKER_40]: 1 of the groups that we're going to be working with is a group called RG reliable riders transportation company.

255
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:44,410
[SPEAKER_40]: This is a shuttle service.

256
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,110
[SPEAKER_40]: It's a van.

257
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:52,854
[SPEAKER_40]: The effort is to create 3 trips, or maybe more today to provide for the clients, but also provide for.

258
00:25:54,455 --> 00:26:12,946
[SPEAKER_40]: employees the team understands that there is no parking at this facility the team will solve for that challenge they will solve for it for any of their staff who have parking needs we believe that those are maybe three or four people and they will find a area

259
00:26:14,566 --> 00:26:21,133
[SPEAKER_40]: garage that may not be in Medford, it may be closer to transit, it may be some of the transit that they have.

260
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:23,736
[SPEAKER_40]: There's a lot of parking in those areas.

261
00:26:24,517 --> 00:26:30,123
[SPEAKER_40]: And then the shadow will create predictability for these employees.

262
00:26:30,143 --> 00:26:32,165
[SPEAKER_40]: In terms of clients, I'm told that

263
00:26:33,249 --> 00:26:40,895
[SPEAKER_40]: No clients have cars, at least it's been the experience of all of our practitioners that clients do not come with their own cars.

264
00:26:41,676 --> 00:26:45,239
[SPEAKER_40]: And so that solves an issue right there for us.

265
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:56,488
[SPEAKER_40]: So we feel confident and comfortable that the shuttle service will provide full access to and from the facility without needing to have on-site parking.

266
00:26:57,185 --> 00:27:04,711
[SPEAKER_40]: And that being said, Andrew and Steve continue to talk to abutters and neighbors to see if there are opportunities, but so far there have not been.

267
00:27:04,951 --> 00:27:16,040
[SPEAKER_40]: And again, we do not feel like that's necessary, but more we need to solve for some of the questions and some of the permitting questions that we've been asked during this process.

268
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:24,847
[SPEAKER_40]: And so we are trying to see if maybe we can even just have a couple of spaces nearby, even though we don't think it will be essential for the program.

269
00:27:27,142 --> 00:27:28,343
[SPEAKER_40]: Go through this a little bit.

270
00:27:28,423 --> 00:27:34,468
[SPEAKER_40]: I mean, there will be 24 hour security and there will always be a staff member on site at all times.

271
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:42,415
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, the facility provides on site, um, laundry services and, you know, food and meals as commercial kitchen.

272
00:27:43,215 --> 00:27:47,799
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, and, um, and of course, sleeping, sleeping arrangements.

273
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:52,163
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, I'm going to skip over a couple of these items.

274
00:27:52,183 --> 00:27:53,384
[SPEAKER_40]: Because I want to.

275
00:27:54,191 --> 00:27:55,651
[SPEAKER_40]: available for questions if you have it.

276
00:27:56,131 --> 00:28:06,674
[SPEAKER_40]: There's all kinds of classes, counseling, job counseling, meditation services, financial literacy classes, and the like.

277
00:28:08,434 --> 00:28:11,495
[SPEAKER_40]: Other educational credit counseling services.

278
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:13,816
[SPEAKER_40]: I mentioned financial literacy coaching.

279
00:28:14,096 --> 00:28:15,036
[SPEAKER_40]: This is what I wanted to show you.

280
00:28:15,796 --> 00:28:17,156
[SPEAKER_40]: This is Justice for Housing.

281
00:28:17,176 --> 00:28:19,697
[SPEAKER_40]: This is Leslie's entity right now.

282
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:20,777
[SPEAKER_40]: She has two

283
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:26,200
[SPEAKER_40]: buildings right now that she's operating.

284
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,523
[SPEAKER_40]: 74 Morris Street in Dorchester and 241 Woodrow Ave in Dorchester.

285
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:35,187
[SPEAKER_40]: Both of these properties are right in residential neighborhoods.

286
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:39,971
[SPEAKER_40]: If you walk by them, you would think that they're just a regular house in Dorchester.

287
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:44,495
[SPEAKER_40]: They know their neighbors, they are active in their community.

288
00:28:45,816 --> 00:28:47,697
[SPEAKER_40]: During the fall, there might be

289
00:28:49,157 --> 00:28:52,279
[SPEAKER_40]: a pumpkin on the stair, you know, et cetera.

290
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,821
[SPEAKER_40]: These are people who are in this house all the time.

291
00:28:56,522 --> 00:28:59,423
[SPEAKER_40]: And this was that stat that I heard from Leslie earlier.

292
00:28:59,463 --> 00:29:01,285
[SPEAKER_40]: They have over 367 clients.

293
00:29:02,025 --> 00:29:06,408
[SPEAKER_40]: Only 1% has needed to go back into temporary housing.

294
00:29:06,568 --> 00:29:12,111
[SPEAKER_40]: The rest have really been able to get on their own feet.

295
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:24,261
[SPEAKER_40]: Tiesha has worked with all these other groups, as have the other two practitioners who are with us, Ruthie and Leslie, but Tiesha has worked with all these other groups in some capacity.

296
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:28,366
[SPEAKER_40]: She may be referring someone from the Pines Trident, she may be referring someone from St.

297
00:29:28,406 --> 00:29:29,967
[SPEAKER_40]: Francis, Casa Merna, etc.

298
00:29:30,348 --> 00:29:33,091
[SPEAKER_40]: The one thing I've heard from all the practitioners is that

299
00:29:33,491 --> 00:29:37,557
[SPEAKER_40]: There are almost no domestic violence resources anywhere in Massachusetts.

300
00:29:37,597 --> 00:29:41,802
[SPEAKER_40]: It's extremely hard to find any resource like this.

301
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:48,191
[SPEAKER_40]: There might be a scattered site here and there in someone's house separated from services.

302
00:29:48,852 --> 00:29:50,695
[SPEAKER_40]: This is a very rare thing indeed.

303
00:29:53,094 --> 00:29:54,695
[SPEAKER_40]: There are a number of rules associated.

304
00:29:54,715 --> 00:29:57,137
[SPEAKER_40]: This will be a non-smoking facility.

305
00:29:57,658 --> 00:30:01,281
[SPEAKER_40]: There's no alcohol, no drugs.

306
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:16,036
[SPEAKER_40]: These are very regimented facilities that are supervised and intended to help bring people into a healthy environment and get them into the right pathway.

307
00:30:17,103 --> 00:30:24,128
[SPEAKER_40]: So now I want to shift from the use and just kind of close out here more on some of the physical attributes of the site.

308
00:30:24,548 --> 00:30:36,857
[SPEAKER_40]: Some of the maybe even you might say shortcomings of the site, but that we're dealing with as a result and how we're dealing with those challenges as we are proposing here to you for site plan review.

309
00:30:37,817 --> 00:30:40,419
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, so, uh, there is no parking.

310
00:30:40,459 --> 00:30:41,100
[SPEAKER_40]: I mentioned that.

311
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:45,223
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, I also mentioned that most residents will not own their own vehicle.

312
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:48,565
[SPEAKER_40]: I believe all of the clients will not own their own vehicle.

313
00:30:49,146 --> 00:30:55,891
[SPEAKER_40]: And in the case of those two or three staff members, I believe that we will be creating a shuttle service that will bring them to the facility.

314
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:59,053
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, there's ample MBTA services.

315
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:06,339
[SPEAKER_40]: Uh, there are always going to be an employee on site, but the total number of employees, not that many, five to six,

316
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:11,101
[SPEAKER_40]: And that during any one shift, there might be half of that.

317
00:31:11,641 --> 00:31:21,824
[SPEAKER_40]: The I did want to just have this little graphic on the side that, you know, there is we do want to build a sidewalk off of our property.

318
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:23,165
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't have.

319
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:27,370
[SPEAKER_40]: We would provide those two to the city for approval.

320
00:31:28,331 --> 00:31:38,423
[SPEAKER_40]: And we do believe this is a 61 foot frontage on the site we do believe that there would be space for at least two, maybe three, three cars on the front of the building.

321
00:31:40,952 --> 00:31:52,001
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, so I do think practically speaking, pickup, drop off, you know, deliveries, those types of things, it's good to have some space to do that with.

322
00:31:52,421 --> 00:31:55,203
[SPEAKER_40]: And that would be what that would be made available for.

323
00:31:55,223 --> 00:32:03,750
[SPEAKER_40]: I mentioned there's ample parking and then, of course, the orange line and the shuttle will tie into these resources.

324
00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:09,010
[SPEAKER_40]: We provided a traffic study from Fossil O'Neill engineers.

325
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:23,654
[SPEAKER_40]: This is, I just wanted to share with you, is that the way traffic studies work, as you've seen in your capacity as on this board, is they look at what the previous use was, they look at what the proposed use is, and they see what the difference is.

326
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:33,677
[SPEAKER_40]: Here, there is no difference because the previous use and the proposed use have the same impact based on what we're proposing, based on what was there.

327
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:43,022
[SPEAKER_40]: Uh, and that's, uh, we've provided this, this, um, memorandum from Faso O'Neill, and we're happy to, you know, uh, answer any questions about that.

328
00:32:45,003 --> 00:32:51,487
[SPEAKER_40]: Uh, Faso O'Neill concludes that based on the foregoing assessment, it is the professional opinion of Faso O'Neill that the proposed development at 21 St.

329
00:32:51,547 --> 00:32:54,929
[SPEAKER_40]: Clair will have negligible impacts on traffic operation within the study areas.

330
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,671
[SPEAKER_40]: Just finally, finally,

331
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,480
[SPEAKER_40]: Finally here.

332
00:33:00,341 --> 00:33:21,292
[SPEAKER_40]: So there were a number of comments made from your various departments within Medford, by the way, it's been a pleasure to work with Medford and your various departments and your staff, and all of us for certain things and we are fully compliant to with all of these items that they've asked us to, of course, most of these things are going to have to happen once we get into the actual.

333
00:33:22,272 --> 00:33:24,213
[SPEAKER_40]: work and the construction level documents.

334
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:33,775
[SPEAKER_40]: I mentioned the wheelchair ramp at the side entrance and some of the other items that I shared during the course of this presentation.

335
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:39,776
[SPEAKER_40]: So now might be, Madam Chair, a good time for me to pause and answer any questions along with the team as well.

336
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:41,697
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you for the opportunity to be in front of you today.

337
00:33:42,057 --> 00:33:42,317
[SPEAKER_40]: Thank you.

338
00:33:44,899 --> 00:33:46,740
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for the thorough presentation.

339
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:49,441
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate the detail.

340
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:56,284
[SPEAKER_22]: So just to give everybody an idea of how this is going to go, I'm going to open up to the board for our questions and comments.

341
00:33:56,864 --> 00:33:59,565
[SPEAKER_22]: And then after that, there will be a public comment period.

342
00:33:59,585 --> 00:34:06,389
[SPEAKER_22]: And then there will be a board deliberation after the public comment period.

343
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:11,771
[SPEAKER_22]: So with that, I'd like to open up to the board for any questions or comments.

344
00:34:13,924 --> 00:34:19,786
[SPEAKER_22]: Board members, feel free to raise your hand or unmute yourself.

345
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:22,887
[SPEAKER_22]: Adam.

346
00:34:22,907 --> 00:34:26,948
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, everybody.

347
00:34:27,248 --> 00:34:29,189
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for presenting, Michael.

348
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:34,871
[SPEAKER_24]: Just a question on the educational services.

349
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:42,273
[SPEAKER_24]: So are the teaching members of the particular staff

350
00:34:44,160 --> 00:35:01,000
[SPEAKER_24]: uh like affiliated specifically with 21 st claire road are they part of sort of the larger organization um and and and just like how does that kind of work on a given week or or or or what's the sort of process that you guys have

351
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:15,494
[SPEAKER_24]: for allocating the teaching resources from an instructor perspective to meet the goals you outlined in terms of educating and providing opportunities for the people that are housed.

352
00:35:16,469 --> 00:35:18,271
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, I really appreciate the question.

353
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:25,577
[SPEAKER_40]: I think you'll get a real much better answer having either Leslie or Taisha or Ruthie respond.

354
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:32,243
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't know if either one of you want to talk about how you slot in the teaching courses and that kind of thing.

355
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:39,689
[SPEAKER_40]: I don't know if that's you, Leslie, or I mean, I can give it a shot based on what we've talked about.

356
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,931
[SPEAKER_26]: I couldn't unmute myself, so.

357
00:35:44,173 --> 00:35:45,794
[SPEAKER_26]: That's why I didn't respond.

358
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:56,983
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Madam Board and staff and members that are here tonight for allowing us to present.

359
00:35:58,485 --> 00:36:00,226
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a structured

360
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:12,482
[SPEAKER_26]: educational system, really on focusing on workforce development, getting people back to work.

361
00:36:12,983 --> 00:36:18,790
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a licensed CDL trainer that comes in and

362
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:32,813
[SPEAKER_26]: We have also a component where people can learn how to put in solar windows or solar panels.

363
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:39,695
[SPEAKER_26]: That has produced jobs for our participants.

364
00:36:39,715 --> 00:36:43,836
[SPEAKER_26]: 84% of the participants have gone on to acquire

365
00:36:52,018 --> 00:37:08,317
[SPEAKER_26]: livable wages so that they can afford a livable wage housing without having any assistance from public housing or any facility like that.

366
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:24,703
[SPEAKER_26]: We're also educating people and getting resume building, digital literacy, computer skills, things of nature that people need when they're rebuilding their lives.

367
00:37:26,283 --> 00:37:37,287
[SPEAKER_26]: Most of the participants have had, I can say, a life that they've been on

368
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:48,202
[SPEAKER_26]: on systems of power like welfare, social security, things that have prevented them from getting, you know, sustainable jobs.

369
00:37:49,943 --> 00:37:52,923
[SPEAKER_26]: And so therefore, it's a fresh start.

370
00:37:54,183 --> 00:37:57,324
[SPEAKER_26]: In addition to that, we have life skills.

371
00:37:57,584 --> 00:38:01,165
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know if Ruthie or Tisha wants to add anything else.

372
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:09,252
[SPEAKER_22]: And if you have trouble unmuting, just, oh, Taisha, I see you unmuted.

373
00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:10,192
[SPEAKER_07]: Perfect.

374
00:38:10,252 --> 00:38:11,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, thank you.

375
00:38:11,992 --> 00:38:23,356
[SPEAKER_07]: And so just to add to that, yes, we will be having individuals come to us as opposed to, you know, clients having to leave off the premises.

376
00:38:23,376 --> 00:38:31,479
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sure for some things they will go outside, but for the majority, everything will be on site.

377
00:38:32,299 --> 00:38:33,504
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope I answered that.

378
00:38:33,584 --> 00:38:35,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if Ruthie has anything to add.

379
00:38:44,075 --> 00:38:44,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Ruth Wallens.

380
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:46,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, good evening.

381
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:51,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so, and I hope I can add more value to the question.

382
00:38:51,581 --> 00:39:02,730
[SPEAKER_12]: So, based on the population we're going to be working with, so every provider, community partners that we've already had experience with working with, with this population, will be trauma-informed.

383
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:12,738
[SPEAKER_12]: So not only are we going to, you know, in regards to financial literacy and supporting them around domestic violence services, we will also be working with the children.

384
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:22,165
[SPEAKER_12]: So we do have, between the three of us, we have licensed clinicians, trauma support, domestic violence services.

385
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:30,171
[SPEAKER_12]: So really, we already have the services and partnerships in place with other organizations that we're doing this work.

386
00:39:32,072 --> 00:39:38,453
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's more so we're just trying to provide empowerment and wraparound services for the whole family.

387
00:39:39,054 --> 00:39:44,415
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're not recreating something new based on our experience in doing this work.

388
00:39:44,495 --> 00:39:49,496
[SPEAKER_12]: We already have partners in line to work with us that will be coming in working with the clients.

389
00:39:49,876 --> 00:39:54,557
[SPEAKER_12]: The goal is to provide services at the resident where the program would be at.

390
00:39:56,857 --> 00:39:59,498
[SPEAKER_12]: So I hope I was able to add value to the question.

391
00:40:00,317 --> 00:40:05,120
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, with a focus on maintaining, rebuilding oneself.

392
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,904
[SPEAKER_26]: So a resume building, financial literacy, like she said, credit is a big barrier.

393
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:24,270
[SPEAKER_26]: And so we really focus on budgeting, credit, how to manage a bank account, how to obtain a mortgage.

394
00:40:25,191 --> 00:40:28,753
[SPEAKER_26]: Our goal is to get people from

395
00:40:29,938 --> 00:40:34,280
[SPEAKER_26]: shelter to stable housing and to home ownership.

396
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,382
[SPEAKER_26]: And that's what Justice for Housing, our role is.

397
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:43,904
[SPEAKER_22]: Adam, any follow up questions?

398
00:40:46,665 --> 00:40:47,285
[SPEAKER_25]: No, I'm good.

399
00:40:48,106 --> 00:40:48,406
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

400
00:40:49,498 --> 00:40:52,499
[SPEAKER_22]: I see two board hands, and I think I also see a member of the public's hand.

401
00:40:52,839 --> 00:40:59,500
[SPEAKER_22]: Just a quick reminder, this is board questions and comments at this time, and we will get to public comment.

402
00:41:00,401 --> 00:41:03,681
[SPEAKER_22]: Ari, I believe I saw your hand next.

403
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:05,982
[SPEAKER_15]: Perfect.

404
00:41:06,022 --> 00:41:08,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to the applicants for the application.

405
00:41:08,563 --> 00:41:13,924
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds like a really wonderful project that will provide a lot of benefit to the community.

406
00:41:14,004 --> 00:41:18,265
[SPEAKER_15]: My question is actually more to city staff and

407
00:41:19,248 --> 00:41:32,531
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd love if you can kind of tell us a little bit about how common it is for Dover amendments to be non-traditional schools, so not universities, public schools, and the like.

408
00:41:32,571 --> 00:41:34,312
[SPEAKER_15]: And I imagine that that's a common question.

409
00:41:34,432 --> 00:41:42,454
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you can give us some context and history and norms for the public, that would be very appreciated.

410
00:41:45,635 --> 00:41:46,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, Madam Chair.

411
00:41:48,367 --> 00:41:54,073
[SPEAKER_10]: I am so when this case this potential project was originally brought to us.

412
00:41:54,994 --> 00:42:05,745
[SPEAKER_10]: We met with them with Robin Stein, one of our attorneys from KP law to review how this was how this could be permitted should this be permitted.

413
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:14,871
[SPEAKER_10]: And when their lawyers said, well, this would be a Dover use, she assured us that that was actually a very common way of permitting projects like this.

414
00:42:15,391 --> 00:42:23,857
[SPEAKER_10]: That as long as this is not the kind of shelter that opens its doors at night, people come in and sleep and then leave in the daytime.

415
00:42:24,238 --> 00:42:27,560
[SPEAKER_10]: That would not necessarily, that we were not talking about.

416
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,982
[SPEAKER_10]: This is where somebody lives there and there are supportive services.

417
00:42:31,363 --> 00:42:34,265
[SPEAKER_10]: She said that is actually very commonly permitted as a Dover use.

418
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:38,887
[SPEAKER_10]: I do not have, I did not make any note of case law.

419
00:42:38,947 --> 00:42:50,053
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't sure if that's at all helpful, but I assume that the applicant's lawyers came prepared with some case law to cite as necessary for it.

420
00:42:51,314 --> 00:42:56,717
[SPEAKER_10]: We took our lawyer's word for it that this is a standard way of permitting a project like this.

421
00:42:58,155 --> 00:43:01,056
[SPEAKER_22]: Ari, would you be interested in hearing some of that information?

422
00:43:01,076 --> 00:43:08,359
[SPEAKER_15]: I would, you know, we don't have to read every word of it, but I'd love to hear confirmation of that.

423
00:43:08,399 --> 00:43:08,759
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

424
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:14,922
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, I mean, you know, and maybe I put Maggie on deck and put you on the spot, my associate who.

425
00:43:16,224 --> 00:43:18,125
[SPEAKER_40]: who chased down all these cases.

426
00:43:18,185 --> 00:43:26,950
[SPEAKER_40]: But I mean, I think, you know, you're in Medford, and you're probably used to having Tufts University show up and, you know, and apply under the Dover Amendment.

427
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,291
[SPEAKER_40]: But it's really the concept is the same.

428
00:43:30,372 --> 00:43:32,473
[SPEAKER_40]: It's intended for educational purposes.

429
00:43:32,853 --> 00:43:40,938
[SPEAKER_40]: And long ago, the question about whether or not a facility like this would

430
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:42,822
[SPEAKER_40]: qualify.

431
00:43:42,842 --> 00:43:47,064
[SPEAKER_40]: And I think the leading case is McLean Hospital, which I'm sure you've all heard of.

432
00:43:47,944 --> 00:43:54,146
[SPEAKER_40]: And McLean Hospital does a lot of the types of services here that we're talking about on a much larger scale.

433
00:43:55,047 --> 00:44:03,630
[SPEAKER_40]: And it's McLean Hospital who, when they were initially permitting their facilities nearby, Lincoln, I believe,

434
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:06,412
[SPEAKER_40]: maybe not that nearby, but in Massachusetts.

435
00:44:07,052 --> 00:44:08,413
[SPEAKER_40]: It's a Massachusetts case.

436
00:44:09,393 --> 00:44:25,204
[SPEAKER_40]: This was, and other versions like that, McLean's the one that we cited in the materials that we sent to you, this is exactly what was cited, and this is what the Supreme Judicial Court has cited and continues to cite as the most recent relevant type of law in this space.

437
00:44:25,864 --> 00:44:31,888
[SPEAKER_40]: And for those reasons, and then many others, I mean, I don't know, Maggie, how close I got there, if you're,

438
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,691
[SPEAKER_40]: Maggie Roberts, attorney.

439
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:51,596
[SPEAKER_19]: I echo what Mike said, it's, you know, there's a whole body of case law, but it's really just comes down to the education purposes of this broad concept.

440
00:44:52,016 --> 00:44:57,558
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think, you know, it's that one case and many others, it's,

441
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:14,298
[SPEAKER_19]: There are these immersive residential programs where they're teaching their clients to lead productive lives, be independent.

442
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:19,181
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the quote is, education is a broad concept.

443
00:45:20,341 --> 00:45:25,184
[SPEAKER_19]: And yeah, so just like Mike said, you can kind of

444
00:45:28,857 --> 00:45:34,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, it's a broader concept that comes as more than just traditional school.

445
00:45:40,403 --> 00:45:40,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

446
00:45:40,783 --> 00:45:47,767
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm finding this quote from the Fitchburg case very helpful and sensible.

447
00:45:50,589 --> 00:45:51,909
[SPEAKER_15]: That's on the shared screen right now.

448
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:53,410
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate the thorough answer.

449
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:56,252
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Ari.

450
00:45:57,192 --> 00:45:58,313
[SPEAKER_22]: Peter, I see your hand.

451
00:46:00,853 --> 00:46:11,340
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, I have one question for the applicant and then a confirmation of a couple of things.

452
00:46:13,181 --> 00:46:23,588
[SPEAKER_25]: The question for the applicant is, what is going to be the scope of the educational services provided on the site?

453
00:46:24,328 --> 00:46:26,790
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you have that broken down and

454
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:30,439
[SPEAKER_25]: hours of instruction per day?

455
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:35,563
[SPEAKER_25]: Or is it not quite a model that you can measure in something like that?

456
00:46:38,205 --> 00:46:46,912
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, I mean, we are still, you know, months away from opening our doors, we still have to build out the facility.

457
00:46:47,032 --> 00:46:47,993
[SPEAKER_40]: And we do need to

458
00:46:49,418 --> 00:46:55,902
[SPEAKER_40]: formally engage the team and really bring them in to do this work.

459
00:46:55,962 --> 00:47:06,809
[SPEAKER_40]: So I can perhaps ask them to talk about what their experiences have been in other facilities and what the goal will be on this based on the number of our clients and the like.

460
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:11,452
[SPEAKER_40]: But we still are probably a good six months away from opening our door.

461
00:47:11,472 --> 00:47:16,615
[SPEAKER_40]: So some of this stuff, I just want to put it in brackets there, if I could.

462
00:47:17,275 --> 00:47:17,856
[SPEAKER_40]: Maybe, Ashley.

463
00:47:18,915 --> 00:47:19,716
[SPEAKER_25]: That's great.

464
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:27,742
[SPEAKER_25]: I just am trying to get a sense of, like I said, the scope of educational services that are provided on site.

465
00:47:28,302 --> 00:47:31,965
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, I can tell you from our other houses how we have random.

466
00:47:33,012 --> 00:47:36,155
[SPEAKER_26]: So first of all, no case is alike.

467
00:47:36,976 --> 00:47:41,760
[SPEAKER_26]: Everybody doesn't have the same social issue, right?

468
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,245
[SPEAKER_26]: And so first we have case managers who assess, right?

469
00:47:47,265 --> 00:47:57,454
[SPEAKER_26]: Our goal is to stabilize, then educate, rebuild, and then focus on

470
00:48:02,538 --> 00:48:07,123
[SPEAKER_26]: on, what do you say, out, like coming out of the home.

471
00:48:08,304 --> 00:48:16,653
[SPEAKER_26]: So first, we have our case managers who assess the needs.

472
00:48:17,914 --> 00:48:18,435
[SPEAKER_26]: We have

473
00:48:21,318 --> 00:48:35,110
[SPEAKER_26]: Monthly meetings that have to have house meetings, we have a monthly house meetings and then we have weekly sessions with either a workforce development.

474
00:48:37,627 --> 00:48:39,548
[SPEAKER_26]: depending on which class you're in.

475
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:43,089
[SPEAKER_26]: If you're taking CDL, they come twice a week.

476
00:48:43,669 --> 00:48:48,751
[SPEAKER_26]: If you're taking a solar panel, that's every day.

477
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:52,992
[SPEAKER_26]: That's nine to five every day on site.

478
00:48:54,153 --> 00:48:54,653
[SPEAKER_26]: Different

479
00:48:55,814 --> 00:48:58,117
[SPEAKER_26]: Vocational classes have different needs.

480
00:48:58,157 --> 00:49:03,565
[SPEAKER_26]: Digital literacy we do in the evenings three times a week.

481
00:49:04,126 --> 00:49:07,851
[SPEAKER_26]: Financial literacy, I can go on and on.

482
00:49:07,971 --> 00:49:09,854
[SPEAKER_26]: Financial literacy is done

483
00:49:12,197 --> 00:49:13,437
[SPEAKER_26]: as needed.

484
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:26,340
[SPEAKER_26]: Everybody's credit barriers aren't the same, and so everybody gets a coach, and that coach determines how much time they need with that particular individual.

485
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:29,140
[SPEAKER_25]: That's great.

486
00:49:29,561 --> 00:49:36,022
[SPEAKER_25]: That gives me, that's plenty for my, at least for my understanding of the programming.

487
00:49:36,482 --> 00:49:36,802
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

488
00:49:40,463 --> 00:49:41,343
[SPEAKER_21]: Any other board

489
00:49:42,218 --> 00:49:43,759
[SPEAKER_21]: comments or questions?

490
00:49:44,459 --> 00:49:45,760
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, wait, just a second.

491
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,782
[SPEAKER_25]: I realized I had a couple other things.

492
00:49:48,982 --> 00:49:55,426
[SPEAKER_25]: One of which was just a confirmation that the St.

493
00:49:55,466 --> 00:50:08,054
[SPEAKER_25]: Clair Road, at least on the MassDOT roadway jurisdiction, roadway inventory map, which is in my day job as a traffic engineer, what we use to determine jurisdiction does have St.

494
00:50:08,094 --> 00:50:10,195
[SPEAKER_25]: Clair Road listed as a public way so that

495
00:50:11,617 --> 00:50:16,438
[SPEAKER_25]: That does support the applicant's claim and something that we'll have to figure out.

496
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:24,120
[SPEAKER_25]: And this question, I think, is, oh, wait, no.

497
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:31,941
[SPEAKER_25]: I was going to say I have a question for city staff about what the options were for Dover amendment.

498
00:50:31,961 --> 00:50:36,402
[SPEAKER_25]: But I think Attorney Ross did a good job of going through those.

499
00:50:37,882 --> 00:50:39,403
[SPEAKER_25]: So I actually had those written down in my notes.

500
00:50:39,443 --> 00:50:39,923
[SPEAKER_25]: So thank you.

501
00:50:43,403 --> 00:50:44,204
[SPEAKER_22]: Great, thank you, Peter.

502
00:50:47,006 --> 00:50:49,147
[SPEAKER_22]: Any other comments or questions from the board?

503
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:57,714
[SPEAKER_22]: I just had a couple of thoughts I wanted to share before we move over to public comment period.

504
00:50:57,754 --> 00:51:00,836
[SPEAKER_22]: I see we have a lot of people on the call this evening, so I'll be brief.

505
00:51:03,919 --> 00:51:06,981
[SPEAKER_22]: I did like that you mentioned adding a sidewalk in front of the building.

506
00:51:07,781 --> 00:51:16,167
[SPEAKER_22]: However, that does leave a significant gap between the corner of the street and the St.

507
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:17,207
[SPEAKER_22]: Clair Road building.

508
00:51:18,468 --> 00:51:23,271
[SPEAKER_22]: So that is something that I would like to hear more about, or maybe we could put in our conditions.

509
00:51:25,372 --> 00:51:27,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Parking is always going to be a concern in Medford.

510
00:51:28,775 --> 00:51:32,378
[SPEAKER_22]: We're working really hard as a city to make sure we're doing the right thing for that.

511
00:51:32,898 --> 00:51:39,143
[SPEAKER_22]: I was a little concerned to hear that solving for parking is still in process.

512
00:51:40,044 --> 00:51:51,833
[SPEAKER_22]: I hear your comments on the shuttle, and this may be a question more for city staff, but I am curious what parking regulations or restrictions, if any, are currently in place on St.

513
00:51:51,893 --> 00:51:53,594
[SPEAKER_22]: Clair or if it's just a

514
00:51:54,735 --> 00:51:57,718
[SPEAKER_22]: Wild West, like the roads we have in Medford.

515
00:51:57,738 --> 00:52:06,927
[SPEAKER_40]: I'm sure I think that the staff was under the impression that it was a private roadway area to look at it.

516
00:52:08,108 --> 00:52:09,430
[SPEAKER_40]: It does really look like that.

517
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:14,154
[SPEAKER_40]: I would not blame them for a 2nd for thinking that that is exactly what this was.

518
00:52:15,097 --> 00:52:22,642
[SPEAKER_40]: Um, you know, I think we would love to participate in supporting the city by creating a sidewalk in front of the building.

519
00:52:23,363 --> 00:52:24,644
[SPEAKER_40]: I would imagine at some point.

520
00:52:25,444 --> 00:52:34,110
[SPEAKER_40]: The city would probably want to, you know, put some capital resources into putting a sidewalk there, although that's the city's decision, but I think by at least.

521
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:35,972
[SPEAKER_40]: Hitting our sidewalk.

522
00:52:36,772 --> 00:52:49,739
[SPEAKER_40]: we can do our part to support that effort and we could create the appropriate transitions back to the ground condition, you know, whether it's a tactile strip on either side, however the Public Works Department wants us to do that.

523
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:56,383
[SPEAKER_40]: And then when the other streets are ready, you know, when the other sidewalk is ready, it will work.

524
00:52:57,364 --> 00:53:03,948
[SPEAKER_40]: But I think it's just too much of a cost to think about doing an entire sidewalk from this side to the corner and

525
00:53:04,928 --> 00:53:06,709
[SPEAKER_40]: also some logistics with the abutters.

526
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:14,652
[SPEAKER_40]: It just puts us in a whole other different role and cost bracket that we weren't prepared to sign up for.

527
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:20,035
[SPEAKER_40]: But in response to the comment, what we agreed to do is to do the sidewalk in front of our facility.

528
00:53:20,055 --> 00:53:22,196
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate the feedback.

529
00:53:22,716 --> 00:53:24,697
[SPEAKER_22]: And I see Director Hunt's hand is raised.

530
00:53:26,804 --> 00:53:27,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

531
00:53:27,985 --> 00:53:33,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Sort of about the whole, the sidewalk, the accessibility piece of it.

532
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:41,876
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think that we really need to get to the bottom of the fact that our city thinks it's a private way.

533
00:53:41,896 --> 00:53:47,580
[SPEAKER_10]: If it is a public way, we need to have it surveyed and understand what the widths are.

534
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:53,305
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could have sidewalk where that is, clearly there is no edge to the other side of it.

535
00:53:53,365 --> 00:53:55,146
[SPEAKER_10]: It just blends into a parking lot.

536
00:53:56,627 --> 00:53:59,009
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in our best interest to understand that better.

537
00:53:59,489 --> 00:54:01,951
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, we wouldn't have an answer to that tonight.

538
00:54:02,011 --> 00:54:05,053
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a lot of back and forth on this particular question.

539
00:54:06,334 --> 00:54:19,143
[SPEAKER_10]: If this was a public way and it didn't have sidewalk, but it had space for it, then I do believe our traffic and engineering department would ask for the sidewalk to be made all the way to the curb, not just in front of their own property.

540
00:54:20,144 --> 00:54:25,428
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be a standard request if there was space on the road for that to exist.

541
00:54:27,383 --> 00:54:31,545
[SPEAKER_10]: And set that aside, I don't think that that item could get solved tonight.

542
00:54:32,065 --> 00:54:38,788
[SPEAKER_10]: The question about where there could be just sort of public parking, all of our public streets are open for the public.

543
00:54:39,228 --> 00:54:43,711
[SPEAKER_10]: No spot in front of somebody's house is a private spot unless they are on a private way.

544
00:54:44,391 --> 00:54:50,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I will, however, mention that if you just cross Fulton Street, sorry, Fells Way West,

545
00:54:50,914 --> 00:55:00,063
[SPEAKER_10]: to the other side of Fulton Street, that stretch of Fulton Street along in front of Gillis Park, there is parking on both sides.

546
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:08,292
[SPEAKER_10]: We do find that people from the apartment house on this the corner there over by Gillis and Hickey Parks park on that street.

547
00:55:08,692 --> 00:55:10,694
[SPEAKER_10]: There does tend to be street parking there.

548
00:55:11,134 --> 00:55:14,198
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're talking about two or three staff people,

549
00:55:14,738 --> 00:55:21,707
[SPEAKER_10]: There is no reason why they couldn't be parking across Fellsway West and walking over to their place of employment a block or two.

550
00:55:21,727 --> 00:55:24,050
[SPEAKER_10]: It feels very reasonable to me.

551
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:31,641
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that in the big picture way, our concern around parking is resident vehicles.

552
00:55:33,303 --> 00:55:41,730
[SPEAKER_10]: I do understand that in percentage wise, people who are homeless tend not to have vehicles unless of course they were living in their vehicle.

553
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:44,753
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's where they were before they came to the shelter.

554
00:55:45,674 --> 00:55:52,540
[SPEAKER_10]: The other item is that if somebody is a victim of domestic violence, that does not necessarily mean that they are a very low income.

555
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,526
[SPEAKER_10]: They may need to be in the shelter because they are running from someone, but that doesn't mean they don't have a car.

556
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:08,774
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I do think that the organization really needs to think about that because there would be no long-term parking for residential vehicles here.

557
00:56:09,075 --> 00:56:22,926
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the recommended conditions that we have been putting forth in a number of our buildings, regardless of what kind of building, we have done this for our high-income apartment buildings,

558
00:56:23,887 --> 00:56:29,249
[SPEAKER_10]: is that the tenants are not eligible for residential permit parking.

559
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:33,610
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is a condition that can be put in place in this case.

560
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:38,651
[SPEAKER_10]: I recognize that there is no permit parking at this time in this neighborhood.

561
00:56:39,051 --> 00:56:42,012
[SPEAKER_10]: That means that there won't ever be permit parking.

562
00:56:42,933 --> 00:56:49,735
[SPEAKER_10]: There could be in the future and this condition would go with the length of the duration of the building.

563
00:56:50,195 --> 00:56:51,035
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

564
00:56:51,653 --> 00:56:53,674
[SPEAKER_26]: Can I chime in real quick?

565
00:56:54,234 --> 00:57:03,779
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a domestic violence house right now with 22 rooms and none of our participants have cars.

566
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:10,942
[SPEAKER_26]: Out of the three houses that we have had, we haven't had any residents have cars.

567
00:57:11,642 --> 00:57:27,718
[SPEAKER_26]: If they do have cars, like we mentioned before, we will have a shuttle that comes to the facility three times a day to take them to the train station, and we do have T-passes that we provide.

568
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,781
[SPEAKER_22]: That's really helpful information.

569
00:57:30,801 --> 00:57:31,682
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Leslie.

570
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:39,053
[SPEAKER_22]: With that, I'm going to now open the public comment period.

571
00:57:40,053 --> 00:57:46,977
[SPEAKER_22]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

572
00:57:47,577 --> 00:57:53,040
[SPEAKER_22]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

573
00:57:54,241 --> 00:57:58,223
[SPEAKER_22]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

574
00:57:59,156 --> 00:58:05,798
[SPEAKER_22]: A reminder to everyone, we have disabled the chat function as that is not part of the public record.

575
00:58:06,158 --> 00:58:09,439
[SPEAKER_22]: We want to keep the public record discussion available for all.

576
00:58:09,459 --> 00:58:16,881
[SPEAKER_22]: However, if you are having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.

577
00:58:17,561 --> 00:58:19,762
[SPEAKER_22]: We'll see your comment and troubleshoot with you.

578
00:58:21,093 --> 00:58:29,356
[SPEAKER_22]: Members of the public will have two minutes to provide comment, and we'll do our best to provide a warning before the end of the comment time.

579
00:58:30,236 --> 00:58:36,478
[SPEAKER_22]: Each member of the public will only have one two-minute period to provide their comment.

580
00:58:36,979 --> 00:58:45,522
[SPEAKER_22]: If you have additional comments, please feel free to submit via email at the aforementioned email address, ocd at medford-ma.gov.

581
00:58:54,052 --> 00:59:04,337
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to hand it over to Danielle to comment queue and then read any previously sent emails or letters.

582
00:59:06,118 --> 00:59:12,581
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Chair, I have a raised hand with a username of iPad KR.

583
00:59:14,762 --> 00:59:16,743
[SPEAKER_14]: What was the time limit that we're giving?

584
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:18,163
[SPEAKER_14]: Two minutes.

585
00:59:18,863 --> 00:59:19,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Two minutes.

586
00:59:23,419 --> 00:59:29,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there, can I volunteer someone on the board to man a timer?

587
00:59:29,862 --> 00:59:30,923
[SPEAKER_22]: I can keep an eye on time.

588
00:59:31,543 --> 00:59:31,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

589
00:59:32,604 --> 00:59:32,804
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

590
00:59:32,824 --> 00:59:35,765
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to ask to unmute iPad KR.

591
00:59:43,149 --> 00:59:43,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi.

592
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:47,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I appreciate there's a lot of information in this meeting tonight.

593
00:59:48,632 --> 00:59:52,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I am begging the board to keep the hearing open for review

594
00:59:52,877 --> 00:59:56,339
[SPEAKER_04]: the material of tonight's presentation with an expert.

595
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:01,943
[SPEAKER_04]: The property also has a restrictive covenant of the deed relative to educational use.

596
01:00:02,924 --> 01:00:07,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you received written approval of that from the party for the use?

597
01:00:09,029 --> 01:00:18,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I have many, many questions and I'm disappointed to only have two minutes because this has gone on for a very long time and two minutes is not enough.

598
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:20,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a direct abutter.

599
01:00:20,361 --> 01:00:22,843
[SPEAKER_04]: My property is listed as lot 22.

600
01:00:22,883 --> 01:00:33,171
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to explain that parking is our main issue here in this neighborhood, safety being the second.

601
01:00:33,752 --> 01:00:36,194
[SPEAKER_04]: In front of the building, you propose a sidewalk.

602
01:00:36,974 --> 01:00:43,760
[SPEAKER_04]: No one mentioned that there is a hydrant there and that it is in fact a fire lane.

603
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:46,201
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no external

604
01:00:49,526 --> 01:00:59,634
[SPEAKER_04]: fire escapes, it's 40 rooms where tonight you learn now it's 37, which varies from the plan that they originally submitted.

605
01:00:59,654 --> 01:01:04,418
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's no elevator.

606
01:01:04,759 --> 01:01:09,943
[SPEAKER_04]: There are two rooms on the first floor that will be handicapped accessible.

607
01:01:09,963 --> 01:01:16,569
[SPEAKER_04]: The perimeter of the building

608
01:01:17,488 --> 01:01:23,079
[SPEAKER_04]: There's four feet on the left hand side, which is where the proposed ramp would go to the side door.

609
01:01:24,702 --> 01:01:26,926
[SPEAKER_04]: How would the children get to this place structure?

610
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:37,157
[SPEAKER_04]: And the corner is the entire width along the left-hand side of the building against the chain link fence is four feet.

611
01:01:37,597 --> 01:01:44,282
[SPEAKER_04]: At the back, it's five feet, which goes to seven feet on the right-hand corner.

612
01:01:47,444 --> 01:01:51,507
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to point out problems in the planning.

613
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:53,989
[SPEAKER_04]: The planning room 6789,

614
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,201
[SPEAKER_04]: looks like it's two levels.

615
01:01:58,622 --> 01:02:02,846
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is not enough time and unacceptable explanation.

616
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,769
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have another feedback.

617
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:12,215
[SPEAKER_22]: We would love to have your name and address which is required at the start of your your comment.

618
01:02:12,556 --> 01:02:15,339
[SPEAKER_22]: And I really appreciate your feedback and coming to the meeting this evening.

619
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:16,620
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

620
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:18,403
[SPEAKER_42]: Can I go next?

621
01:02:18,563 --> 01:02:18,803
[SPEAKER_42]: Yes.

622
01:02:18,823 --> 01:02:19,564
[SPEAKER_42]: Can I go next?

623
01:02:19,744 --> 01:02:21,245
[SPEAKER_42]: My name is Abida Bhanu.

624
01:02:21,685 --> 01:02:22,265
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

625
01:02:23,326 --> 01:02:28,408
[SPEAKER_22]: Comments are going to be called in order by Daniel Evans.

626
01:02:28,428 --> 01:02:32,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So Abida is here and she's the other rebutter on the opposite side of the building.

627
01:02:32,831 --> 01:02:32,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.

628
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:33,331
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

629
01:02:33,351 --> 01:02:34,231
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't understand.

630
01:02:34,672 --> 01:02:35,012
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

631
01:02:35,132 --> 01:02:37,033
[SPEAKER_04]: So she's actually here with me as well.

632
01:02:37,093 --> 01:02:39,934
[SPEAKER_04]: She lives in the property at 11 St.

633
01:02:40,615 --> 01:02:40,955
[SPEAKER_42]: 11 St.

634
01:02:41,035 --> 01:02:42,235
[SPEAKER_42]: Clair Road.

635
01:02:42,255 --> 01:02:46,898
[SPEAKER_22]: Before we get in, could the first speaker please provide their name and address for the record?

636
01:02:47,688 --> 01:02:51,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's Kelly Raso, and I live at 35 St.

637
01:02:51,555 --> 01:02:52,256
[SPEAKER_04]: Francis Street.

638
01:02:53,318 --> 01:03:00,310
[SPEAKER_04]: My property is lot 22, which the public could perceive as green space for the building.

639
01:03:02,495 --> 01:03:03,756
[SPEAKER_20]: But that's not actually the case.

640
01:03:03,796 --> 01:03:05,116
[SPEAKER_20]: The property is four feet.

641
01:03:05,196 --> 01:03:05,997
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Kelly.

642
01:03:06,477 --> 01:03:08,898
[SPEAKER_20]: At this time, we're going to move on to the next.

643
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:11,300
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm going to ask you that.

644
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:17,963
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to tell you that a beater would like to speak, but I would like to explain for her her conditions because of her accent.

645
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:19,524
[SPEAKER_04]: She feels intimidated to speak.

646
01:03:20,224 --> 01:03:30,149
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to say that in the proposed age number landscape conceptual site plan, the building

647
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:35,971
[SPEAKER_04]: the bushes and all of these things that are in the site plan.

648
01:03:37,311 --> 01:03:38,772
[SPEAKER_04]: It says there that there's a gate.

649
01:03:39,572 --> 01:03:45,153
[SPEAKER_04]: That gate would go into the property of the Vita at 11 St.

650
01:03:45,173 --> 01:03:45,713
[SPEAKER_04]: Clair Road.

651
01:03:46,473 --> 01:03:52,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says that a five foot clear pedestrian access gate,

652
01:03:53,773 --> 01:03:56,235
[SPEAKER_04]: That would imply that people would walk down her driveway.

653
01:03:56,516 --> 01:04:02,401
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no other access from that side of the situation in that is.

654
01:04:04,764 --> 01:04:08,407
[SPEAKER_04]: There's clearly not enough information here in the.

655
01:04:09,662 --> 01:04:10,703
[SPEAKER_42]: I want to talk a little bit.

656
01:04:10,803 --> 01:04:12,244
[SPEAKER_42]: Please give me the opportunity.

657
01:04:12,264 --> 01:04:15,045
[SPEAKER_42]: I am next door, 11 St.

658
01:04:15,165 --> 01:04:16,806
[SPEAKER_42]: Clair Road, Medford, MA.

659
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:20,989
[SPEAKER_42]: And I am very shocked to know this kind of shelter.

660
01:04:21,849 --> 01:04:25,451
[SPEAKER_42]: And my neighbor, one of the neighbor bring it to my attention.

661
01:04:25,952 --> 01:04:27,973
[SPEAKER_42]: I'm shocked, still I'm shocked.

662
01:04:28,533 --> 01:04:32,876
[SPEAKER_42]: And I care about my safety and it will invade my privacy.

663
01:04:33,396 --> 01:04:34,677
[SPEAKER_42]: Doesn't matter 37 rooms or not.

664
01:04:36,898 --> 01:04:51,050
[SPEAKER_42]: My question is the fire land, there's no parking, and do those property, those are non-profit property, do they pay property tax yearly like us?

665
01:04:52,151 --> 01:04:58,296
[SPEAKER_42]: And also, I want to say that I'm very shocked that

666
01:04:59,658 --> 01:05:04,562
[SPEAKER_42]: shelter is coming to the neighborhood where we're living in peace.

667
01:05:05,302 --> 01:05:09,006
[SPEAKER_42]: And of course, a lot of people have the same objection.

668
01:05:09,586 --> 01:05:10,807
[SPEAKER_42]: Please pay attention.

669
01:05:11,327 --> 01:05:16,472
[SPEAKER_42]: This is not the right place for the right residents.

670
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:22,457
[SPEAKER_42]: I wish you can bring it to public attention, please, please.

671
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:24,319
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

672
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:26,961
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate your feedback.

673
01:05:31,926 --> 01:05:32,967
[SPEAKER_22]: Danielle, who do we have next?

674
01:05:33,367 --> 01:05:34,469
[SPEAKER_22]: OK, let me see.

675
01:05:34,589 --> 01:05:40,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Apologies, in China.

676
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:45,219
[SPEAKER_22]: And I see there might be a couple of situations where we have two people on the call.

677
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:55,790
[SPEAKER_22]: If there are any other people that are off camera that have two people, just give us a heads up and we'll make sure to provide enough time for both people who are with you to speak.

678
01:05:57,185 --> 01:05:57,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

679
01:05:57,586 --> 01:06:03,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, the second person in line with their hands up is Lisa Simonetti.

680
01:06:03,116 --> 01:06:06,182
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to ask to unmute you.

681
01:06:07,023 --> 01:06:09,388
[SPEAKER_22]: And please state your name and address for the record.

682
01:06:11,056 --> 01:06:11,376
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

683
01:06:11,396 --> 01:06:12,457
[SPEAKER_28]: So good evening.

684
01:06:12,617 --> 01:06:14,038
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for hosting this meeting.

685
01:06:14,098 --> 01:06:17,300
[SPEAKER_28]: My name is Lisa Simonetti and I am at 85 Fulton Spring Road.

686
01:06:17,361 --> 01:06:19,662
[SPEAKER_28]: So I am on the same side as St.

687
01:06:19,722 --> 01:06:21,143
[SPEAKER_28]: Francis and Ridgeway.

688
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,105
[SPEAKER_28]: The third straight up.

689
01:06:23,545 --> 01:06:25,046
[SPEAKER_28]: So I have a couple of questions.

690
01:06:25,246 --> 01:06:26,467
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope I can run through them.

691
01:06:26,507 --> 01:06:31,230
[SPEAKER_28]: I would love to be able to get some answers from them about them.

692
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:34,233
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd like to know what the maximum occupancy is going to be you're saying.

693
01:06:35,275 --> 01:06:37,717
[SPEAKER_28]: You said it was a 40 person shelter.

694
01:06:37,897 --> 01:06:54,032
[SPEAKER_28]: So we just found out tonight that it's a domestic violence shelter, which I understand people need a place to go to be safe, but in this congested a neighborhood with a 40 occupancy, or are you gonna be 40 adults with any number of children?

695
01:06:54,092 --> 01:06:56,194
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd like to know what the maximum occupancy is.

696
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:02,442
[SPEAKER_28]: My understanding of Dover is that it is a robust educational amendment.

697
01:07:03,282 --> 01:07:16,908
[SPEAKER_28]: And to compare it, quite frankly, to McLean's Hospital, which is on rolling greens in Belmont, is just a little disingenuous, considering the very, very congested area that Fulton Heights has become.

698
01:07:18,501 --> 01:07:24,886
[SPEAKER_28]: A number of the homes on Fulton Street are now rental units and they park on Ridgeway on St.

699
01:07:24,946 --> 01:07:33,253
[SPEAKER_28]: Francis and on Fulton Spring Road, which are all private ways which we get no benefit from our city to keep those roads up kept.

700
01:07:34,534 --> 01:07:38,878
[SPEAKER_28]: And we are so congested and I'd love to know when they did the traffic study, quite frankly.

701
01:07:40,152 --> 01:07:42,093
[SPEAKER_28]: I agree with the folks who live at St.

702
01:07:42,133 --> 01:07:46,014
[SPEAKER_28]: Clair because that happens to be my parish church, that is a fire lane.

703
01:07:46,555 --> 01:07:49,616
[SPEAKER_28]: And for the few masses that are still said at St.

704
01:07:49,676 --> 01:08:02,341
[SPEAKER_28]: Francis Parish, what's gonna happen there on Saturdays and Sundays if God forbid there's ever a fire and you're not gonna be able to get a fire truck through because you've got parking and a sidewalk that's just gonna jut out from the old convent.

705
01:08:03,061 --> 01:08:08,444
[SPEAKER_28]: And to say that the uses are exactly the same, first of all, that building's been vacant for I don't know how many years.

706
01:08:09,362 --> 01:08:34,013
[SPEAKER_28]: And to compare it to 15 or 18 nuns living there who never had vehicles or anything else to what would be there now with full time staff 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, it's just being very disingenuous, and not very honest to the people of Medford, who are going to have a domestic violence shelter in a highly, highly congested area.

707
01:08:34,868 --> 01:08:35,468
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Lisa.

708
01:08:35,508 --> 01:08:36,789
[SPEAKER_22]: I really appreciate your feedback.

709
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:45,434
[SPEAKER_22]: And we are going to save responses to any questions to the applicant at the conclusion of the public comment period.

710
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,615
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

711
01:08:51,218 --> 01:08:56,801
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, the next person is Leo Lafarge asking to unmute.

712
01:08:57,522 --> 01:08:59,383
[SPEAKER_22]: And please state your name and address for the record.

713
01:08:59,926 --> 01:09:05,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, my name is Linda and I'm with my husband Leo, Linda and Leo Lafarge.

714
01:09:05,733 --> 01:09:12,580
[SPEAKER_08]: We live at 463 Fellsway West and my front door exits onto St.

715
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:13,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Clair Road.

716
01:09:15,323 --> 01:09:18,565
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I'm not sure about this traffic study that you did.

717
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:25,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the same questions about the roadway and how small that road is.

718
01:09:25,808 --> 01:09:34,331
[SPEAKER_08]: It is only one way between the back of the church back door to St.

719
01:09:34,491 --> 01:09:35,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Francis Street.

720
01:09:35,952 --> 01:09:41,614
[SPEAKER_08]: That where we have this two spots that park on somebody else's property and about

721
01:09:42,734 --> 01:09:44,996
[SPEAKER_08]: 10 feet wide for cars to get through.

722
01:09:45,496 --> 01:09:50,039
[SPEAKER_08]: So parking and traffic will be impacted in that area for sure.

723
01:09:50,360 --> 01:10:07,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know you say that people aren't going to bring their cars to work and people aren't going to have cars at the shelter, but I can already see that the two parking spots that we have, because we can't park in front of the house and we can't park on the side of the house, would be impacted.

724
01:10:08,172 --> 01:10:12,954
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm also concerned about a homeless shelter going into the neighborhood.

725
01:10:13,434 --> 01:10:24,880
[SPEAKER_08]: We just had those condo units put in a few years ago, which has greatly increased the amount of people in the neighborhood and the water usage and everything else.

726
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,781
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just really upset.

727
01:10:27,841 --> 01:10:29,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a child with special needs.

728
01:10:30,582 --> 01:10:33,764
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's it's very upsetting that this is going to be

729
01:10:35,024 --> 01:10:40,128
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel a safety issue for my child, my family, and I'm not happy about it.

730
01:10:40,148 --> 01:10:45,252
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can't believe we're hearing about this tonight about a homeless shelter in Bedford.

731
01:10:48,935 --> 01:10:49,655
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Linda.

732
01:10:50,576 --> 01:10:51,877
[SPEAKER_22]: Leo, did you want to speak as well?

733
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:59,283
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I need to unmute them again.

734
01:10:59,303 --> 01:10:59,343
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

735
01:10:59,903 --> 01:11:01,444
[SPEAKER_14]: I forgot there are two people.

736
01:11:01,885 --> 01:11:02,045
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

737
01:11:05,156 --> 01:11:05,797
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he's fine.

738
01:11:06,577 --> 01:11:07,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we're good.

739
01:11:07,538 --> 01:11:08,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

740
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:09,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate your feedback.

741
01:11:12,822 --> 01:11:16,525
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, next speaker is Lynn's iPhone.

742
01:11:17,766 --> 01:11:18,767
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm asking to unmute.

743
01:11:19,768 --> 01:11:22,050
[SPEAKER_22]: Could you please name and address for the record?

744
01:11:22,668 --> 01:11:24,109
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is Lynn Sullivan.

745
01:11:24,349 --> 01:11:27,931
[SPEAKER_11]: I live at 121 Riverside Avenue in Medford.

746
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:31,573
[SPEAKER_11]: That is my parish church I go to at St.

747
01:11:31,613 --> 01:11:33,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis.

748
01:11:33,154 --> 01:11:39,117
[SPEAKER_11]: One of my questions is, you have a lot of things to keep the adults busy.

749
01:11:39,297 --> 01:11:42,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's going to be watching the children throughout the day and evening?

750
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:44,220
[SPEAKER_11]: And where are they going to play?

751
01:11:47,401 --> 01:11:53,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Second of all, I wanted to ask, will this be Americans or will this be housing illegal immigrants?

752
01:11:57,870 --> 01:12:02,173
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to save responses to all public comments for the end of the public hearing.

753
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:04,655
[SPEAKER_22]: So if you have additional comments, I'd encourage you to share them.

754
01:12:05,916 --> 01:12:07,738
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I just asked about the children.

755
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:12,382
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, we'll respond to all public comments at the end of the.

756
01:12:12,983 --> 01:12:13,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sorry.

757
01:12:13,743 --> 01:12:15,504
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that was the question I had.

758
01:12:16,145 --> 01:12:16,625
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

759
01:12:16,645 --> 01:12:19,407
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought you were answering questions.

760
01:12:21,188 --> 01:12:27,052
[SPEAKER_22]: We're trying to collect all the questions because I'm sure a lot of people have similar concerns, but we want to hear from everybody.

761
01:12:27,492 --> 01:12:29,173
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you have anything else to add, Lynn?

762
01:12:31,294 --> 01:12:32,195
[SPEAKER_11]: Not right now, no.

763
01:12:33,576 --> 01:12:34,816
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much for your feedback.

764
01:12:34,857 --> 01:12:35,617
[SPEAKER_22]: I really appreciate it.

765
01:12:41,455 --> 01:12:43,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Richard Rosso is next.

766
01:12:45,916 --> 01:12:49,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my name is Richard Rosso.

767
01:12:49,997 --> 01:12:51,277
[SPEAKER_05]: I reside at 35 St.

768
01:12:51,317 --> 01:12:52,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Francis street as well.

769
01:12:53,297 --> 01:12:56,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm a lifelong Method resident, 58 years.

770
01:12:57,318 --> 01:13:00,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I've served the city on the police department for 24 years.

771
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:01,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm retired.

772
01:13:01,799 --> 01:13:03,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also a business owner in the city.

773
01:13:04,559 --> 01:13:07,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And my concern is the safety in the building.

774
01:13:08,567 --> 01:13:13,768
[SPEAKER_05]: with the four stories they have, I've responded to many calls.

775
01:13:14,628 --> 01:13:25,111
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's a problem up on the third, second, third, fourth floor, are they gonna have an elevator or is the emergency services gonna have to run up four flights of stairs?

776
01:13:25,891 --> 01:13:28,772
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this gonna be ADA compliant for the whole building?

777
01:13:29,292 --> 01:13:34,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I think as an educational facility, it should be ADA compliant.

778
01:13:36,231 --> 01:13:36,911
[SPEAKER_05]: on the whole floor.

779
01:13:36,991 --> 01:13:38,191
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd like an answer to that.

780
01:13:38,872 --> 01:13:45,113
[SPEAKER_05]: And also I'd like to know why the traffic study, the citizens are in the neighborhood, couldn't see the traffic study.

781
01:13:45,853 --> 01:13:54,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to try to table this for the future because I'd like to confer with the lawyer and let them see the traffic study.

782
01:13:54,795 --> 01:13:58,956
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanna also know if it's gonna be ADA approved.

783
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:03,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm concerned about the fire and the children in the building.

784
01:14:04,298 --> 01:14:13,021
[SPEAKER_05]: If something goes on in one of the upper floors, are they going to have to wait for emergency services to go up three flights, four flights, and how are they going to get them down?

785
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:14,661
[SPEAKER_05]: It's concerning.

786
01:14:14,681 --> 01:14:18,202
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

787
01:14:18,362 --> 01:14:18,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

788
01:14:20,323 --> 01:14:20,963
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Richard.

789
01:14:20,983 --> 01:14:22,044
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate your feedback.

790
01:14:23,404 --> 01:14:27,626
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Chair, I just want to state for the record that the application materials

791
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:33,691
[SPEAKER_14]: that are on the city website should include the traffic study.

792
01:14:33,711 --> 01:14:35,531
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that was a late addition.

793
01:14:37,332 --> 01:14:39,392
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll verify that it is there.

794
01:14:39,412 --> 01:14:40,872
[SPEAKER_14]: If it is not there, I'll put it there.

795
01:14:42,053 --> 01:14:45,854
[SPEAKER_22]: And I realized that we're sending a link to the current filings.

796
01:14:47,174 --> 01:14:51,855
[SPEAKER_22]: Would it be appropriate to drop a link specifically to the traffic study?

797
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:56,616
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, if somebody can send that for me.

798
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:04,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Take the next calls, and I'll get the link directly to this folder and then one to the traffic study while you take the next comment.

799
01:15:04,884 --> 01:15:06,905
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, next speaker is Kevin Wong.

800
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:08,606
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, Kevin.

801
01:15:08,906 --> 01:15:09,626
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address.

802
01:15:10,987 --> 01:15:12,808
[SPEAKER_36]: My name is Kevin Wong from 1 St.

803
01:15:12,848 --> 01:15:13,348
[SPEAKER_36]: Clair Road.

804
01:15:14,769 --> 01:15:16,710
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you for the opportunity to speak.

805
01:15:17,431 --> 01:15:23,394
[SPEAKER_36]: The proposal seems nice, and I think if well executed, could provide a lot of value to the clients.

806
01:15:24,441 --> 01:15:31,027
[SPEAKER_36]: But as a part of the community where the shelter will be located, I'm worried about the long-term sustainability of the project.

807
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:37,212
[SPEAKER_36]: And I also want to make sure that there will not be negative long-term impact on the community.

808
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:39,614
[SPEAKER_36]: So two points I'd like to call out.

809
01:15:40,655 --> 01:15:47,500
[SPEAKER_36]: First at a glance from what I can see on the material available online, the property is owned by real estate developers.

810
01:15:48,690 --> 01:16:00,817
[SPEAKER_36]: who seek to profit from this property and the property will be operated by a company, Pathway Alliance, that I learned is just three months old and founded by a real estate agent.

811
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:06,320
[SPEAKER_36]: I think it is easy to write a proposal and name names in your proposal, but execution is hard.

812
01:16:08,106 --> 01:16:13,332
[SPEAKER_36]: Second, a shuttle is proposed, but without parking and more direct access to public transportation.

813
01:16:14,052 --> 01:16:19,118
[SPEAKER_36]: Can a shelter really serve its educational purpose in getting their clients back on their feet?

814
01:16:19,959 --> 01:16:28,749
[SPEAKER_36]: So, given those 2 points, if I may make a request to the Board, is to consider the long-term impact of allowing the Dover Amendment to be applied here.

815
01:16:29,993 --> 01:16:39,459
[SPEAKER_36]: and to make sure that there are mechanisms in place to keep the petitioner and the operator accountable, such that it continues to serve its intended educational purpose.

816
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:46,683
[SPEAKER_36]: From what I've seen, there is no track record that indicates it will continue to serve that purpose in the long run.

817
01:16:46,703 --> 01:16:48,484
[SPEAKER_36]: That will be all.

818
01:16:48,664 --> 01:16:50,225
[SPEAKER_36]: I appreciate the board for listening to me.

819
01:16:51,546 --> 01:16:52,126
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Kevin.

820
01:16:52,146 --> 01:16:53,887
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate you taking the time.

821
01:16:58,248 --> 01:16:59,229
[SPEAKER_22]: Stephen Angeloni.

822
01:16:59,249 --> 01:17:01,931
[SPEAKER_22]: I see there's two of y'all.

823
01:17:02,391 --> 01:17:03,552
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you each want to speak?

824
01:17:05,193 --> 01:17:05,573
[SPEAKER_16]: I think so.

825
01:17:05,593 --> 01:17:07,394
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll try to keep it brief.

826
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:10,336
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Iga Angeloni and Stephen Angeloni.

827
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:11,057
[SPEAKER_16]: We're at 1 St.

828
01:17:11,097 --> 01:17:13,338
[SPEAKER_16]: Clair Road at the condo buildings on the corner.

829
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:22,705
[SPEAKER_16]: I think, you know, we all have the same questions about whether the Dover Amendment is being applied appropriately or perhaps a bit liberally.

830
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:25,647
[SPEAKER_16]: From my understanding, just because a

831
01:17:26,636 --> 01:17:37,220
[SPEAKER_16]: an organization falls under nonprofit status, does not automatically give them protection under the Dover Amendment, unless the main source of the facility's use is education.

832
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:54,887
[SPEAKER_16]: And to me, this sounds like the main source of the facility is shelter, and that education would be a component and perhaps a part of the programming, though, admittedly, there was, you know, it was a little bit vague, and we're six months away, so it's not fully fleshed out yet, it sounds like.

833
01:17:57,135 --> 01:18:02,979
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I want to echo Lisa and some other sentiments, Kevin's sentiments about the community impact.

834
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:10,083
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we're concerned in general, of course, about changes in safety, congestion, parking, et cetera.

835
01:18:11,524 --> 01:18:22,992
[SPEAKER_16]: But being a domestic violence shelter, I think I'm also concerned about domestic violence, the people that the, I guess clients are,

836
01:18:23,876 --> 01:18:31,401
[SPEAKER_16]: running away from finding this area and maybe increasing, I don't know, the danger in the area here.

837
01:18:31,701 --> 01:18:34,463
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm curious a little bit about the security.

838
01:18:34,483 --> 01:18:37,245
[SPEAKER_16]: You mentioned a security guard on staff, but what does that really mean?

839
01:18:37,285 --> 01:18:38,406
[SPEAKER_16]: What does that really entail?

840
01:18:40,648 --> 01:18:48,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Just generally a little bit concerned for the long-term impacts for those of us who are walking that space every single night.

841
01:18:51,115 --> 01:18:51,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

842
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:55,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's all I'm into.

843
01:18:57,663 --> 01:18:57,883
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

844
01:18:57,923 --> 01:19:00,083
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate you both joining the call and giving feedback.

845
01:19:04,224 --> 01:19:04,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Michael Ruiz.

846
01:19:06,965 --> 01:19:07,485
[SPEAKER_23]: Name and address.

847
01:19:08,305 --> 01:19:08,826
[SPEAKER_23]: Hi, good evening.

848
01:19:08,846 --> 01:19:09,866
[SPEAKER_23]: My name is Michael Ruiz.

849
01:19:09,926 --> 01:19:10,986
[SPEAKER_23]: I live at 45 St.

850
01:19:11,026 --> 01:19:14,147
[SPEAKER_23]: Francis Street, directly behind Abita.

851
01:19:15,443 --> 01:19:21,267
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, I'd like to echo a lot of my neighbors concerned about the, uh, the impact on the, on the neighborhood.

852
01:19:22,028 --> 01:19:22,888
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, but I also.

853
01:19:23,549 --> 01:19:26,151
[SPEAKER_23]: Question the validity of that, um, that Dover act.

854
01:19:26,171 --> 01:19:31,034
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, the, uh, the educational programs, I understand I'm a, I'm a lifelong utility worker.

855
01:19:31,355 --> 01:19:44,284
[SPEAKER_23]: And, um, as a, as a tradesman, um, I can assure you that we do need, um, you know, train people in the workforce because we're losing them, but I don't see how two days a week is going to train somebody for a CDL.

856
01:19:45,575 --> 01:19:50,036
[SPEAKER_23]: How are they going to do that in a parking lot that's got a street running through it?

857
01:19:51,376 --> 01:19:57,178
[SPEAKER_23]: Solar panel installation, again, it's a great idea, but are they going to hang solar panels on the building?

858
01:19:57,318 --> 01:20:00,739
[SPEAKER_23]: I mean, there's only so much classroom-type work.

859
01:20:00,779 --> 01:20:03,299
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of that is hands-on training that needs to be done.

860
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:08,140
[SPEAKER_23]: My other concern is just the neighborhood in general.

861
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:09,101
[SPEAKER_23]: I know human nature.

862
01:20:09,121 --> 01:20:10,761
[SPEAKER_23]: People aren't going to want to wait for the shuttle.

863
01:20:10,781 --> 01:20:11,801
[SPEAKER_23]: They're going to be late for work.

864
01:20:11,821 --> 01:20:12,501
[SPEAKER_23]: They're going to drive.

865
01:20:12,782 --> 01:20:14,102
[SPEAKER_23]: They're going to leave their cars on St.

866
01:20:14,122 --> 01:20:14,682
[SPEAKER_23]: Francis Street.

867
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:16,217
[SPEAKER_23]: There's no parking on St.

868
01:20:16,257 --> 01:20:20,179
[SPEAKER_23]: Francis Street as it is, thanks to the rooming houses on Fulton Street, the condos.

869
01:20:21,359 --> 01:20:26,341
[SPEAKER_23]: A lot of the multifamily houses around here are now overloaded with tenants.

870
01:20:26,381 --> 01:20:27,501
[SPEAKER_23]: They rent out bedrooms.

871
01:20:28,562 --> 01:20:31,543
[SPEAKER_23]: The city allows that, which is short-sighted on their part.

872
01:20:31,623 --> 01:20:36,604
[SPEAKER_23]: But I don't think this plan will ever really be correct.

873
01:20:36,684 --> 01:20:39,125
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think they'll ever solve the parking issue.

874
01:20:40,206 --> 01:20:42,686
[SPEAKER_23]: I think the whole educational thing is pretty vague.

875
01:20:42,987 --> 01:20:43,807
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just being used

876
01:20:44,988 --> 01:20:45,729
[SPEAKER_23]: to house people.

877
01:20:46,069 --> 01:20:55,235
[SPEAKER_23]: And as Mr. Wong pointed out, when this particular plan isn't self-sustaining, what is that building going to be used for next?

878
01:20:55,315 --> 01:20:56,776
[SPEAKER_23]: What are we opening ourselves up to?

879
01:20:56,796 --> 01:21:00,118
[SPEAKER_23]: These are also some of the concerns of my neighbors.

880
01:21:00,138 --> 01:21:01,819
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for your time.

881
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,440
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Michael.

882
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,481
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate your feedback.

883
01:21:11,505 --> 01:21:12,846
[SPEAKER_14]: Angus Ho is next.

884
01:21:16,686 --> 01:21:18,488
[SPEAKER_38]: Hi, yeah, my name is Pangas Ho.

885
01:21:18,608 --> 01:21:20,089
[SPEAKER_38]: I live in the one St.

886
01:21:20,129 --> 01:21:23,052
[SPEAKER_38]: Clair condominium, which is right down the street from the building.

887
01:21:24,553 --> 01:21:36,122
[SPEAKER_38]: So what I want to, like, you know, add to, like, you know, what my other neighbors had mentioned is, like, you know, I would like to ask the board to really look into the motivation of the developer here.

888
01:21:36,563 --> 01:21:39,085
[SPEAKER_38]: Like, you know, so I did a little bit of research, like, you know,

889
01:21:39,745 --> 01:21:43,446
[SPEAKER_38]: This developer is a luxury home developer across Somerville, Cambridge.

890
01:21:43,966 --> 01:21:52,868
[SPEAKER_38]: And then for historical context as well, we knew that last year they intended to convert the building into a nine-unit condominium to be sold to the public.

891
01:21:53,108 --> 01:22:06,892
[SPEAKER_38]: And then we knew about it because they reached out to our homeowner association looking to rent parking spots from our condo parking lot because they couldn't find any parking for the condo, so they couldn't fulfill the zoning requirements.

892
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,861
[SPEAKER_38]: We didn't end up renting out the parking space for them.

893
01:22:12,141 --> 01:22:15,102
[SPEAKER_38]: So therefore, their luxury condo project couldn't move forward.

894
01:22:15,602 --> 01:22:20,183
[SPEAKER_38]: And then now they converted this project into this shelter project.

895
01:22:20,783 --> 01:22:26,025
[SPEAKER_38]: And as Kevin mentioned as well, this nonprofit that they created to run this

896
01:22:28,212 --> 01:22:34,274
[SPEAKER_38]: The shelter was only three months old, so it was only created after they tried to convert it into a luxury condo.

897
01:22:34,474 --> 01:22:38,196
[SPEAKER_38]: That didn't go through, and only then they created this nonprofit to create the shelter.

898
01:22:38,276 --> 01:22:50,040
[SPEAKER_38]: So again, I would really encourage the board to look into the motivation here, because what I'm worried about is the long-term sustainability here if the developer here is only motivated by profit.

899
01:22:50,361 --> 01:22:50,681
[SPEAKER_38]: Thank you.

900
01:22:52,721 --> 01:22:53,322
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Pongos.

901
01:22:53,342 --> 01:22:53,802
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate it.

902
01:23:05,897 --> 01:23:07,138
[SPEAKER_14]: Emily Lazzaro.

903
01:23:07,158 --> 01:23:10,621
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, thank you.

904
01:23:11,021 --> 01:23:12,102
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm Emily Lazzaro.

905
01:23:12,142 --> 01:23:14,323
[SPEAKER_18]: I live at 170 Mystic Street Extension.

906
01:23:15,204 --> 01:23:16,945
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a Medford City Councilor.

907
01:23:17,345 --> 01:23:20,087
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to voice my support for this project.

908
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:27,173
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate the organizations that are coming together as a coalition to try to make something like this happen.

909
01:23:27,313 --> 01:23:29,234
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm one of my

910
01:23:31,395 --> 01:23:33,876
[SPEAKER_18]: day jobs is working for the Malden Warming Center.

911
01:23:33,896 --> 01:23:38,617
[SPEAKER_18]: I care a lot about folks that deal with this kind of thing.

912
01:23:38,657 --> 01:23:44,979
[SPEAKER_18]: It's very hard to find places for people to live, especially people with children.

913
01:23:46,259 --> 01:23:54,342
[SPEAKER_18]: My organization can't serve children so it can be especially difficult when you're faced with a situation like this and I applaud your compassion and your

914
01:23:55,742 --> 01:23:57,743
[SPEAKER_18]: dedication to this population.

915
01:23:58,603 --> 01:24:07,247
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would also just encourage the board to keep in mind that there are always challenges.

916
01:24:07,367 --> 01:24:12,850
[SPEAKER_18]: I think this is this proposal from the group that's put

917
01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:15,791
[SPEAKER_18]: this paperwork together is pretty comprehensive.

918
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:42,405
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it can be carefully reviewed but I also think that now is especially a time for us to lead with compassion and try to remember that hard decisions are going to have to be made and people are going to face a lot of difficult moments and if we can try to help each other and move forward trying to

919
01:24:44,154 --> 01:24:48,117
[SPEAKER_18]: find a way to assist each other and have empathy and compassion.

920
01:24:48,137 --> 01:24:50,238
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's the best way to move forward.

921
01:24:50,278 --> 01:24:57,123
[SPEAKER_18]: And I would be proud of Medford if we could use an empty building like this for something like the proposed use.

922
01:24:57,723 --> 01:24:58,043
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

923
01:25:00,545 --> 01:25:02,326
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

924
01:25:02,346 --> 01:25:03,147
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate you being here.

925
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:17,264
[SPEAKER_22]: Cheryl R. Name and address, please.

926
01:25:19,768 --> 01:25:20,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

927
01:25:21,009 --> 01:25:29,881
[SPEAKER_09]: I live on 281 Park Street, the neighborhood that Alicia Hunt said that these people can just park in, which they can't because it's very busy over here.

928
01:25:29,942 --> 01:25:30,823
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't support you.

929
01:25:31,771 --> 01:25:34,694
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the neighbors have raised a lot of really good points.

930
01:25:35,215 --> 01:25:38,878
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's kind of sad that a city council logged on to dismiss all those points.

931
01:25:38,959 --> 01:25:40,500
[SPEAKER_09]: But this company is very new.

932
01:25:40,941 --> 01:25:43,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't know that they can succeed in this project.

933
01:25:43,743 --> 01:25:48,048
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's too hard to park there, they'll probably just drop the teaching component and just keep the shelter.

934
01:25:49,190 --> 01:25:49,691
[SPEAKER_09]: in place.

935
01:25:49,731 --> 01:25:58,395
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a real stretch of Dover to say resume help or helping them fill out housing forms would make it an educational facility because that's not true.

936
01:25:59,235 --> 01:26:04,938
[SPEAKER_09]: If you build the shelter, the sidewalk in front of the building, your shelter bus is not going to be able to turn around.

937
01:26:04,998 --> 01:26:06,299
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a very narrow area.

938
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:08,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the parking lot is in use,

939
01:26:08,593 --> 01:26:09,914
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not going to be able to turn around.

940
01:26:09,974 --> 01:26:12,334
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think they've done the math on that properly.

941
01:26:13,035 --> 01:26:16,316
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also wondering about the students that are going to be moving in here.

942
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:18,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Will they be going to Medford schools?

943
01:26:19,557 --> 01:26:20,838
[SPEAKER_09]: Is this a migrant shelter?

944
01:26:20,898 --> 01:26:22,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Will they all need ELL services?

945
01:26:23,159 --> 01:26:29,401
[SPEAKER_09]: As I'm sure everyone on the meeting knows, yesterday we passed two overrides because our schools are overburdened.

946
01:26:29,841 --> 01:26:34,685
[SPEAKER_09]: and we added 103 ELL students in March of 2024 that we couldn't support.

947
01:26:35,186 --> 01:26:38,408
[SPEAKER_09]: So if this is that, then we're going to be in trouble again.

948
01:26:38,428 --> 01:26:40,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to have some clarity.

949
01:26:41,131 --> 01:26:48,257
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they don't have answers to those questions, then I urge the board to not move forward because this plan isn't fleshed out and they're not ready to go.

950
01:26:48,897 --> 01:26:49,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

951
01:26:52,961 --> 01:26:53,601
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Cheryl.

952
01:26:56,924 --> 01:26:57,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Wyman Chow.

953
01:26:58,952 --> 01:26:59,772
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not ready to go.

954
01:26:59,792 --> 01:27:02,273
[SPEAKER_22]: Please state your name and address.

955
01:27:13,315 --> 01:27:14,856
[SPEAKER_22]: Wyman, are you able to hear us?

956
01:27:20,897 --> 01:27:28,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Wyman, I'm clicking the Ask to Unmute button, so I think you need to push the button to unmute yourself.

957
01:27:36,214 --> 01:27:37,515
[SPEAKER_22]: Should we just, should we come back?

958
01:27:37,875 --> 01:27:39,056
[SPEAKER_22]: Move on and we'll come back.

959
01:27:39,436 --> 01:27:42,057
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

960
01:27:42,117 --> 01:27:44,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Next person is Marge.

961
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:48,281
[SPEAKER_14]: Trying to unmute.

962
01:27:48,481 --> 01:27:49,681
[SPEAKER_14]: You should be able to unmute yourself.

963
01:27:55,464 --> 01:27:55,725
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

964
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:01,988
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, Marge, you should be good to go.

965
01:28:02,008 --> 01:28:03,609
[SPEAKER_30]: Okay, can you hear me?

966
01:28:04,224 --> 01:28:05,105
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, thank you.

967
01:28:05,845 --> 01:28:07,627
[SPEAKER_30]: My name is Marge Kirchmeier.

968
01:28:07,687 --> 01:28:09,028
[SPEAKER_30]: I live at 25 St.

969
01:28:09,068 --> 01:28:16,733
[SPEAKER_30]: Francis Street, and my house directly overlooks the parking lot at the church.

970
01:28:17,574 --> 01:28:29,503
[SPEAKER_30]: And one question I had about the parking study is, I'm not sure when they did that study, but I see the parking lot very busy all the time between

971
01:28:30,498 --> 01:28:40,067
[SPEAKER_30]: wedding between funerals and masses and different functions that they have, you know, at the social center.

972
01:28:41,269 --> 01:28:54,482
[SPEAKER_30]: And I'm concerned about the safety of the children plus there's no real playground for these children that is, you know, I know you talked about making a little playground or a

973
01:28:54,922 --> 01:28:57,463
[SPEAKER_30]: on the side of the of the building or something.

974
01:28:58,244 --> 01:29:01,345
[SPEAKER_30]: But children are not going to want to stay in the house 24 7.

975
01:29:01,465 --> 01:29:05,547
[SPEAKER_30]: They're going to want to go outside and they will go outside.

976
01:29:05,567 --> 01:29:08,468
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, that's just the nature of children.

977
01:29:10,069 --> 01:29:20,093
[SPEAKER_30]: And, you know, there's a concern if you have a lot of cars coming and going and possibility of a child getting hit or possibly, you know, fatally injured.

978
01:29:20,793 --> 01:29:23,134
[SPEAKER_30]: I mean, that's that's, you know, a concern.

979
01:29:25,622 --> 01:29:33,970
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, definitely there will be an increase in traffic with the food trucks and the shuttle services that you were talking about.

980
01:29:36,693 --> 01:29:38,535
[SPEAKER_30]: So again, a safety risk.

981
01:29:39,276 --> 01:29:49,686
[SPEAKER_30]: Staffing, I'm a retired nurse and one of my duties in assisted living that I worked in for eight years before I retired

982
01:29:50,380 --> 01:30:00,549
[SPEAKER_30]: I was staffing and scheduling and it is very difficult to, you know, get qualified staff and keep qualified staff.

983
01:30:01,190 --> 01:30:07,996
[SPEAKER_30]: You know, and I have a concern about, you know, the staff is going to be there 24 seven.

984
01:30:09,358 --> 01:30:15,083
[SPEAKER_30]: But what about on the weekends when there's, you know, the case managers are not going to be working on weekends?

985
01:30:15,849 --> 01:30:17,590
[SPEAKER_30]: To my knowledge, they usually don't.

986
01:30:18,650 --> 01:30:33,016
[SPEAKER_30]: And so the, you know, what if it, and it seems like weekends when there's less staff, it's gonna be when there's problems, you know, of the people who are living in the housing.

987
01:30:35,117 --> 01:30:42,860
[SPEAKER_30]: And this could include the police, the ambulance, fire, whatever, you know, the situation might be.

988
01:30:44,069 --> 01:30:55,156
[SPEAKER_30]: And finally, my question is, what consideration of the neighborhood was this before this whole plan was made up?

989
01:30:55,356 --> 01:31:03,882
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't recall ever getting anything in the mail about what was going to be happening here.

990
01:31:06,722 --> 01:31:08,804
[SPEAKER_30]: This is the end of your comment here.

991
01:31:08,824 --> 01:31:11,066
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much for your feedback.

992
01:31:11,226 --> 01:31:12,148
[SPEAKER_22]: I really appreciate it.

993
01:31:12,508 --> 01:31:14,650
[SPEAKER_22]: I do see that there might be somebody else there with you.

994
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:16,813
[SPEAKER_22]: Would they be interested in providing comment?

995
01:31:17,634 --> 01:31:18,755
[SPEAKER_39]: No, thank you.

996
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:21,590
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much, Marge.

997
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:24,131
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate your time and your feedback for this meeting.

998
01:31:24,551 --> 01:31:36,336
[SPEAKER_30]: I just finished one statement that, you know, I do think that you need to involve the community if you're going to be doing a project of this type for us to even get on board with it.

999
01:31:37,596 --> 01:31:40,758
[SPEAKER_14]: The chair, can I ask Marge, I didn't catch your address.

1000
01:31:40,818 --> 01:31:42,678
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sure you said you weren't notified.

1001
01:31:42,698 --> 01:31:45,459
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to make sure if you were on the list of butters.

1002
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,761
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you state your address again, Marge?

1003
01:31:51,019 --> 01:31:51,560
[SPEAKER_30]: 25 St.

1004
01:31:51,620 --> 01:31:52,441
[SPEAKER_30]: Francis Street.

1005
01:31:57,489 --> 01:31:58,331
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you all set?

1006
01:31:58,651 --> 01:31:58,831
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1007
01:31:59,813 --> 01:32:00,374
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, March.

1008
01:32:05,362 --> 01:32:11,205
[SPEAKER_22]: And we are asking people to respect a two-minute time limit for those who have joined after.

1009
01:32:11,225 --> 01:32:19,370
[SPEAKER_22]: We are enforcing that time limit to make sure that everybody who wants to comment can comment, and also respect everybody's time.

1010
01:32:20,110 --> 01:32:34,058
[SPEAKER_22]: If you do have comments beyond that two-minute period, we encourage you to email, and I'll read that email off shortly, email OCD at medford-ma.gov with any additional comments or feedback that you may have.

1011
01:32:35,095 --> 01:32:35,435
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1012
01:32:37,516 --> 01:32:39,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Should we try back?

1013
01:32:39,716 --> 01:32:42,257
[SPEAKER_14]: Waibin Xiao was the one that could not unmute.

1014
01:32:43,157 --> 01:32:43,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1015
01:32:44,038 --> 01:32:44,998
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's try again.

1016
01:32:45,018 --> 01:33:00,602
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, let's move on and maybe circle back at the end of the public comment period.

1017
01:33:03,660 --> 01:33:12,183
[SPEAKER_14]: If anyone is having trouble unmuting, you can direct message me in the chat or you can call the office line.

1018
01:33:13,424 --> 01:33:14,424
[SPEAKER_14]: We're closed actually.

1019
01:33:14,744 --> 01:33:17,645
[SPEAKER_14]: So no one will be able to answer the phone.

1020
01:33:18,765 --> 01:33:20,346
[SPEAKER_14]: You could send me an email as well.

1021
01:33:22,007 --> 01:33:24,908
[SPEAKER_14]: So the next person is Melissa Tobin.

1022
01:33:25,988 --> 01:33:28,009
[SPEAKER_22]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1023
01:33:29,315 --> 01:33:29,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

1024
01:33:29,836 --> 01:33:30,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

1025
01:33:30,396 --> 01:33:33,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm on the way.

1026
01:33:33,458 --> 01:33:34,219
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm sorry.

1027
01:33:34,799 --> 01:33:37,441
[SPEAKER_22]: I just connected to you after Melissa.

1028
01:33:37,461 --> 01:33:39,562
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, we'll be right with you.

1029
01:33:39,722 --> 01:33:40,403
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you so much.

1030
01:33:41,043 --> 01:33:43,905
[SPEAKER_22]: Melissa, if you wouldn't mind stating your name and address for the record.

1031
01:33:44,545 --> 01:33:46,107
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, hi, my name is Melissa Tobin.

1032
01:33:46,207 --> 01:33:50,871
[SPEAKER_34]: I live at 97 Taft streets, lifelong Medford residents.

1033
01:33:51,452 --> 01:34:01,741
[SPEAKER_34]: I just want to echo what my fellow residents of the Fulton Heights said regarding the building being ADA compliance, the parking in front.

1034
01:34:02,462 --> 01:34:06,463
[SPEAKER_34]: Um, the safety, the community impact also.

1035
01:34:06,483 --> 01:34:15,046
[SPEAKER_34]: Um, as we just pass some overrides to further fund our schools, really where how will these children be funded?

1036
01:34:15,066 --> 01:34:15,106
[SPEAKER_34]: Um.

1037
01:34:16,766 --> 01:34:18,507
[SPEAKER_34]: Also interested in learning more.

1038
01:34:19,647 --> 01:34:22,189
[SPEAKER_34]: about the total number of residents.

1039
01:34:22,409 --> 01:34:29,292
[SPEAKER_34]: I know there's 40 rooms, but is it double, triple, or quad occupancy would be great to share with us.

1040
01:34:29,392 --> 01:34:31,953
[SPEAKER_34]: I read through the documents and I did not see any of that.

1041
01:34:32,514 --> 01:34:38,197
[SPEAKER_34]: Some of the documents loaded on the Google site compared to what was presented tonight are a little conflicting.

1042
01:34:39,423 --> 01:34:48,310
[SPEAKER_34]: I also ask and challenge the board to do their due diligence with this matter and not take lawyers' words for things.

1043
01:34:49,651 --> 01:35:06,083
[SPEAKER_34]: You represent the city and also its residents, so we look to you to do your due diligence and not trust every single lawyer because they said so, read the documents, or even a non-profit that's been around for just three months.

1044
01:35:10,254 --> 01:35:19,879
[SPEAKER_34]: I also think we're just coming off a pretty heavy election yesterday with what was it four ballot options just for the city of Medford.

1045
01:35:20,339 --> 01:35:23,081
[SPEAKER_34]: And we have this meeting the very next night.

1046
01:35:24,021 --> 01:35:34,547
[SPEAKER_34]: I feel like it was placed on the calendar and kind of brushed under the rug so that there wouldn't be any comments from the residents.

1047
01:35:35,718 --> 01:35:42,123
[SPEAKER_34]: So I think before you make your decision, you host another meeting when it's not the day after an election in the city.

1048
01:35:42,143 --> 01:35:45,226
[SPEAKER_22]: 10 seconds, if you have any additional comments.

1049
01:35:45,566 --> 01:35:45,987
[SPEAKER_22]: That's it.

1050
01:35:46,087 --> 01:35:46,367
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks.

1051
01:35:47,468 --> 01:35:48,108
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Melissa.

1052
01:35:48,128 --> 01:35:49,009
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate the feedback.

1053
01:35:50,651 --> 01:35:52,192
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll go back to Wyman Chow.

1054
01:35:52,672 --> 01:35:52,892
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1055
01:35:53,273 --> 01:35:53,593
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1056
01:35:53,633 --> 01:35:54,534
[SPEAKER_22]: Wyman, are you still with us?

1057
01:35:58,178 --> 01:35:59,359
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello, can you hear me?

1058
01:35:59,579 --> 01:36:00,039
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry.

1059
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:02,401
[SPEAKER_22]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1060
01:36:03,122 --> 01:36:04,303
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Weimin Shao.

1061
01:36:04,423 --> 01:36:10,568
[SPEAKER_06]: I live in 29th and Francis Street, right next to this building.

1062
01:36:11,568 --> 01:36:19,415
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, when I get the news that this building was sold for the homeless shelters, I felt very much shocked about this news.

1063
01:36:20,234 --> 01:36:31,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Because this building is so confined, I don't think there's enough space for children and women to live in this small building.

1064
01:36:31,823 --> 01:36:40,931
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, the walkway is so narrow, there's no public parking lot, especially for this building.

1065
01:36:41,411 --> 01:36:46,255
[SPEAKER_06]: That's going to add a lot of burden and trouble in the streets around.

1066
01:36:46,915 --> 01:36:48,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Another thing is, now,

1067
01:36:50,043 --> 01:36:57,267
[SPEAKER_06]: 40 rooms for like 40, almost 40 families, which we don't know how many member of people are going to live here.

1068
01:36:57,287 --> 01:37:05,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Going to add a lot of uncertainties in the future in our neighborhood.

1069
01:37:05,970 --> 01:37:07,111
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a new resident.

1070
01:37:07,211 --> 01:37:09,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I just moved in like a few months.

1071
01:37:10,106 --> 01:37:21,773
[SPEAKER_06]: So, when I... before I purchased this house, I found this wonderful place, nice... It's a nice, quiet, peaceful neighborhood.

1072
01:37:22,714 --> 01:37:26,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice neighbors, quiet, you know, streets.

1073
01:37:27,036 --> 01:37:29,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Right behind my house, there is like a church.

1074
01:37:30,278 --> 01:37:31,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything is awesome.

1075
01:37:32,179 --> 01:37:33,880
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I purchased this house.

1076
01:37:34,461 --> 01:37:36,462
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I feel very happy, but...

1077
01:37:37,423 --> 01:37:50,708
[SPEAKER_06]: When I heard this news, which really added a lot of uncertainties in the future of my house, that is why I feel much concern about this.

1078
01:37:50,728 --> 01:38:05,573
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to know how to solve this problem and make us feel more safe, make our neighborhood feel more safe like this.

1079
01:38:10,303 --> 01:38:11,463
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for the feedback, Wyman.

1080
01:38:11,724 --> 01:38:12,464
[SPEAKER_22]: I really appreciate it.

1081
01:38:16,045 --> 01:38:16,886
[SPEAKER_22]: Bobby Mitra?

1082
01:38:17,966 --> 01:38:18,146
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

1083
01:38:18,186 --> 01:38:18,326
[SPEAKER_37]: Hi.

1084
01:38:18,346 --> 01:38:18,867
[SPEAKER_37]: Can you hear me?

1085
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:19,967
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1086
01:38:20,047 --> 01:38:21,187
[SPEAKER_22]: Please state your name and address.

1087
01:38:21,468 --> 01:38:21,688
[SPEAKER_37]: Yeah.

1088
01:38:22,008 --> 01:38:23,308
[SPEAKER_37]: So this is Bobby Mitra.

1089
01:38:23,348 --> 01:38:26,049
[SPEAKER_37]: My wife, Srirupa, and I reside at 17 St.

1090
01:38:26,089 --> 01:38:26,790
[SPEAKER_37]: Francis Street.

1091
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:28,831
[SPEAKER_37]: We moved here 22 years ago.

1092
01:38:28,851 --> 01:38:30,011
[SPEAKER_37]: We've raised two children.

1093
01:38:30,031 --> 01:38:31,612
[SPEAKER_37]: It's a great community.

1094
01:38:32,032 --> 01:38:35,453
[SPEAKER_37]: And thank you to the board for giving us a hearing and to Michael Ross and his team.

1095
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:36,634
[SPEAKER_37]: A lot of data got presented.

1096
01:38:37,174 --> 01:38:39,255
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, I applaud the need to tackle homelessness.

1097
01:38:40,002 --> 01:38:43,687
[SPEAKER_37]: but I'm appalled at the way this is being done.

1098
01:38:44,348 --> 01:38:45,990
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, those of us who reside on St.

1099
01:38:46,010 --> 01:38:46,951
[SPEAKER_37]: Francis' Street in St.

1100
01:38:46,971 --> 01:38:49,554
[SPEAKER_37]: Clair are pretty much coming to know about this today.

1101
01:38:49,574 --> 01:38:52,678
[SPEAKER_37]: You know, it's sort of being presented as a fait accompli.

1102
01:38:52,858 --> 01:38:56,603
[SPEAKER_37]: A lot of effort has obviously gone into preparation and, you know, the presentation.

1103
01:38:56,623 --> 01:38:57,424
[SPEAKER_37]: So,

1104
01:38:58,798 --> 01:39:03,300
[SPEAKER_37]: I just want to echo what my neighbors have been saying, Linda, Lee, Marge, Wyman, and others.

1105
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:05,201
[SPEAKER_37]: There are two things tonight.

1106
01:39:05,621 --> 01:39:09,742
[SPEAKER_37]: One is that whether it's parking, security, the impact on the church, St.

1107
01:39:09,802 --> 01:39:10,703
[SPEAKER_37]: Francis of Assisi.

1108
01:39:10,943 --> 01:39:12,363
[SPEAKER_37]: That's partly why we moved here, too.

1109
01:39:12,423 --> 01:39:14,164
[SPEAKER_37]: It's a beautiful church right behind our house.

1110
01:39:14,804 --> 01:39:18,646
[SPEAKER_37]: Traffic, water, there's a bunch of things that doesn't seem to have been considered.

1111
01:39:19,266 --> 01:39:22,487
[SPEAKER_37]: The other part is that there are just too many unknowns.

1112
01:39:22,647 --> 01:39:25,548
[SPEAKER_37]: Someone talked about, is this a private way or a public way?

1113
01:39:26,029 --> 01:39:26,929
[SPEAKER_37]: That can influence things.

1114
01:39:27,421 --> 01:39:30,303
[SPEAKER_37]: Someone said this non-profit is just three months old.

1115
01:39:31,043 --> 01:39:32,704
[SPEAKER_37]: ADA compliance.

1116
01:39:32,785 --> 01:39:35,026
[SPEAKER_37]: There are a lot of unknowns, and there's not enough data.

1117
01:39:35,646 --> 01:39:40,890
[SPEAKER_37]: And finally, I think this whole thing about educational appears to be spurious.

1118
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:49,595
[SPEAKER_37]: It appears to be duplicitous, because that doesn't seem to be the major intent of the halo house.

1119
01:39:50,736 --> 01:39:55,359
[SPEAKER_37]: And I would really appreciate it if people are straightforward in their communication.

1120
01:39:56,013 --> 01:40:01,974
[SPEAKER_37]: And so if I haven't read this already, I'm completely opposed to this happening here for all the reasons being stated.

1121
01:40:01,994 --> 01:40:02,955
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1122
01:40:04,575 --> 01:40:05,175
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Bapu.

1123
01:40:05,195 --> 01:40:06,495
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate the feedback.

1124
01:40:13,517 --> 01:40:14,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Maria Palermino.

1125
01:40:16,437 --> 01:40:18,898
[SPEAKER_22]: Please state your name and address for the record, Maria.

1126
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,804
[SPEAKER_31]: Actually, this is from a Tuesday.

1127
01:40:23,165 --> 01:40:23,565
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay.

1128
01:40:23,826 --> 01:40:24,807
[SPEAKER_31]: Um, hello.

1129
01:40:24,827 --> 01:40:25,548
[SPEAKER_31]: Can you hear us?

1130
01:40:26,730 --> 01:40:27,992
[SPEAKER_22]: And people on the line?

1131
01:40:28,593 --> 01:40:28,973
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1132
01:40:29,534 --> 01:40:31,798
[SPEAKER_22]: Would you each like two minutes to speak individually?

1133
01:40:32,485 --> 01:40:34,246
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, yeah.

1134
01:40:34,627 --> 01:40:36,488
[SPEAKER_27]: My name is Matilde Sesta.

1135
01:40:36,948 --> 01:40:38,870
[SPEAKER_27]: I live on 39 St.

1136
01:40:38,930 --> 01:40:42,453
[SPEAKER_27]: Francis Street, right behind the convent.

1137
01:40:43,253 --> 01:40:52,820
[SPEAKER_27]: And I agree with everything everybody is saying, but I think these people, they're biting more than they can chew.

1138
01:40:53,501 --> 01:41:01,026
[SPEAKER_27]: Because if you put 40 people, I mean 40 rooms and kids, they're gonna be like ants.

1139
01:41:02,022 --> 01:41:02,523
[SPEAKER_27]: all over.

1140
01:41:03,283 --> 01:41:09,048
[SPEAKER_27]: And besides, I'm all for to help other people, but not on my expenses.

1141
01:41:09,409 --> 01:41:17,836
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been here 45 years, but now lately, every day I have to battle to park.

1142
01:41:18,537 --> 01:41:23,581
[SPEAKER_27]: because I can never stop for half an hour to my house and then go out again.

1143
01:41:24,081 --> 01:41:29,005
[SPEAKER_27]: I have to go in the back and do 10 meters going up and down.

1144
01:41:29,385 --> 01:41:36,531
[SPEAKER_27]: I'm 83 years old and I have to do this because I have to have somebody parked in front of my house.

1145
01:41:37,231 --> 01:41:41,735
[SPEAKER_27]: First with the school went up so many residents.

1146
01:41:42,195 --> 01:41:43,817
[SPEAKER_27]: Now we're going to have more people.

1147
01:41:44,677 --> 01:41:46,879
[SPEAKER_27]: And now they say they won't have enough cars.

1148
01:41:47,239 --> 01:41:50,101
[SPEAKER_27]: But later, let's see the result later.

1149
01:41:50,601 --> 01:41:52,463
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't talk about now.

1150
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:54,944
[SPEAKER_27]: They all promise, promise, promise.

1151
01:41:55,285 --> 01:41:58,047
[SPEAKER_27]: As everybody else, everything at time out.

1152
01:41:58,827 --> 01:42:07,853
[SPEAKER_27]: Now, I apologize this project for everybody around and for my own life safety.

1153
01:42:08,234 --> 01:42:08,614
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

1154
01:42:08,954 --> 01:42:09,334
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1155
01:42:09,354 --> 01:42:10,355
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

1156
01:42:14,133 --> 01:42:15,254
[SPEAKER_31]: This is Maria now.

1157
01:42:16,035 --> 01:42:17,797
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, please state your name.

1158
01:42:18,297 --> 01:42:22,321
[SPEAKER_31]: Okay, Maria to Mayo Palomino 172 Fulton Street, Medford, and

1159
01:42:27,693 --> 01:42:39,726
[SPEAKER_31]: I am really concerned about the fact that there will be so, the people have said this already, about how this number of people will impact the population here.

1160
01:42:40,467 --> 01:42:43,430
[SPEAKER_31]: In this particular area, Fulton, St.

1161
01:42:43,450 --> 01:42:44,171
[SPEAKER_31]: Francis, St.

1162
01:42:44,231 --> 01:42:47,734
[SPEAKER_31]: Clair, it's very, very, very tight.

1163
01:42:48,355 --> 01:42:49,516
[SPEAKER_31]: very congested.

1164
01:42:50,377 --> 01:42:56,822
[SPEAKER_31]: Parking, as Michael Ruiz always already said, is impossible, particularly on St.

1165
01:42:56,862 --> 01:42:57,623
[SPEAKER_31]: Francis Street.

1166
01:42:58,243 --> 01:43:00,865
[SPEAKER_31]: And there is no parking on Fulton Street.

1167
01:43:01,266 --> 01:43:05,289
[SPEAKER_31]: And then there is a private way, but those people have a private way.

1168
01:43:05,669 --> 01:43:08,291
[SPEAKER_31]: That's across from where I live, actually.

1169
01:43:08,872 --> 01:43:14,696
[SPEAKER_31]: So I'm very concerned about the parking situation, the number of people that

1170
01:43:16,187 --> 01:43:27,571
[SPEAKER_31]: there is no, honestly, there is very little space to put a sidewalk in front of this building, because there's the church, right.

1171
01:43:27,791 --> 01:43:39,954
[SPEAKER_31]: And if there is any particular accident, fire, someone needs an ambulance, it's going to be very, very hard for those vehicles to be able to access whoever that might be.

1172
01:43:40,675 --> 01:43:42,055
[SPEAKER_31]: So I feel like

1173
01:43:44,595 --> 01:43:50,417
[SPEAKER_31]: And have the plan show this on one side, they think they're going to put a ramp on another side.

1174
01:43:50,437 --> 01:43:55,118
[SPEAKER_31]: And they're going to put many, many, many bushes and flowers and that's all lovely.

1175
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:58,678
[SPEAKER_31]: But honestly, there doesn't seem to be space to do that.

1176
01:43:59,158 --> 01:44:06,000
[SPEAKER_31]: So for all these reasons that people have already stated parking population, what the

1177
01:44:07,320 --> 01:44:20,484
[SPEAKER_31]: pair of children particularly and you know if people get sick and need and there might be a fire there's seriously no space for those vehicles to enter the property.

1178
01:44:21,564 --> 01:44:21,964
[SPEAKER_31]: Thank you.

1179
01:44:24,265 --> 01:44:27,165
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you to you both for sharing your insight and experience.

1180
01:44:27,666 --> 01:44:28,726
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate you joining the call.

1181
01:44:31,047 --> 01:44:31,507
[SPEAKER_22]: Waleed.

1182
01:44:33,867 --> 01:44:36,248
[SPEAKER_22]: Please state your name and address for the record please.

1183
01:44:37,753 --> 01:44:38,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, can you hear me OK?

1184
01:44:39,274 --> 01:44:40,115
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, thank you.

1185
01:44:40,695 --> 01:44:42,877
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, Waleed Al-Harash.

1186
01:44:43,697 --> 01:44:45,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I live over at 1 Sinclair Road.

1187
01:44:45,619 --> 01:44:53,825
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess first and foremost, I mean, I think this hearing itself, just having listened to everyone, is wildly premature.

1188
01:44:54,966 --> 01:45:04,533
[SPEAKER_03]: Just based on what the attorney said, I forget his name, sorry, and Leslie from the program, I think it's pretty clear that they don't have all their T's crossed and I's dotted.

1189
01:45:04,593 --> 01:45:07,015
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's been a lot of responses from them.

1190
01:45:07,695 --> 01:45:13,558
[SPEAKER_03]: and statements that amount to, I believe this, I think, I'm not sure, that's still being discussed.

1191
01:45:13,978 --> 01:45:14,738
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a plan.

1192
01:45:14,838 --> 01:45:23,622
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just like a haphazard wish in a fountain that they're bringing to a community that's going to be impacted with over 100 people, maybe more.

1193
01:45:23,762 --> 01:45:31,525
[SPEAKER_03]: They've pretty much brought this half-baked plan that's barely been thought through thoroughly from what I've heard and read in their proposal deck so far.

1194
01:45:32,365 --> 01:45:40,130
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to that, I think this whole use of the Dover Amendment is actually so disingenuous hearing them talk about it, it's kind of made my head spin.

1195
01:45:41,291 --> 01:45:56,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Citing the McLean case itself where someone mentioned earlier actually sits on rolling greens and acres of space, not in a spot that's an arm length in every direction from a residential home or property is like disingenuity at its finest.

1196
01:45:57,381 --> 01:45:59,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in addition to that, I just want to be clear

1197
01:46:00,740 --> 01:46:10,245
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a homeless shelter, first and foremost, that's been bundled in a proposal from a real estate company that's trying to profit from it and kind of slide it under this Dover amendment.

1198
01:46:11,099 --> 01:46:23,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think Kevin or Payness may have mentioned before, the same company is the same one that tried to convert the same building into luxury condos and reached out to several of us to try and buy or rent our own parking spaces.

1199
01:46:24,143 --> 01:46:33,706
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do encourage the board to kind of really look into the motivation behind this project, because it's pretty clear based on the timeline, what the developers trying to do.

1200
01:46:34,186 --> 01:46:37,467
[SPEAKER_03]: And the part of it that kind of really upset me the most is,

1201
01:46:38,147 --> 01:46:54,560
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, as someone that was actually raised by a single mom in a domestically abusive household, it's kind of gross seeing this proposal, how they twisted their pitch going from high rise luxury condos to trying to pitch a quote unquote homeless shelter for educational purposes.

1202
01:46:54,620 --> 01:47:04,148
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I just asked the council to take this back and give us more time and more, you know, meeting times to think about this more and consider it further before making a decision.

1203
01:47:04,328 --> 01:47:04,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1204
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:08,362
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Alida, and thank you for being vulnerable with your comments.

1205
01:47:08,402 --> 01:47:09,082
[SPEAKER_22]: I appreciate that.

1206
01:47:13,425 --> 01:47:14,126
[SPEAKER_22]: Jen Proctor.

1207
01:47:15,307 --> 01:47:16,047
[SPEAKER_22]: Please state your name.

1208
01:47:16,407 --> 01:47:19,430
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Jen Proctor.

1209
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:20,590
[SPEAKER_17]: I live at 36 St.

1210
01:47:20,610 --> 01:47:21,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Francis Street.

1211
01:47:22,251 --> 01:47:25,454
[SPEAKER_17]: I just learned of this yesterday from a neighbor.

1212
01:47:26,034 --> 01:47:32,058
[SPEAKER_17]: It was kind of disheartening being a neighbor and not being aware of this coming to my neighborhood.

1213
01:47:33,941 --> 01:47:51,711
[SPEAKER_17]: So regarding the Dover amendment, I don't think right with the lawyer quoted about like they're about six months out, but they didn't actually quote an educational plan, pretty like a concrete plan, which is the whole point of trying to be able to get this through.

1214
01:47:52,712 --> 01:47:57,935
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's disheartening on that part and that it's primarily going to be a shelter.

1215
01:47:57,955 --> 01:48:01,877
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm concerned about safety of both

1216
01:48:02,818 --> 01:48:08,340
[SPEAKER_17]: the potential HALO residents and their children, as well as the community.

1217
01:48:10,161 --> 01:48:14,463
[SPEAKER_17]: Also parking and congestion is a big problem in the area.

1218
01:48:14,483 --> 01:48:28,769
[SPEAKER_17]: And I didn't hear anything about guests and coming to the neighborhoods, but certainly with a 40-room residence, that would have potentially a lot of traffic to the area too.

1219
01:48:30,443 --> 01:48:33,165
[SPEAKER_17]: So I do think there should be some additional considerations here.

1220
01:48:33,185 --> 01:48:40,629
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't seem like all the plans even for the building and ADA compliance is all well thought out as well.

1221
01:48:40,809 --> 01:48:51,075
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think, you know, I share a lot of concerns with my community members that I think there should be additional consideration and further discussion on this.

1222
01:48:53,656 --> 01:48:54,196
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Jen.

1223
01:48:54,216 --> 01:48:55,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate the feedback.

1224
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:07,280
[SPEAKER_22]: Alex.

1225
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:10,242
[SPEAKER_22]: Please state your name and address.

1226
01:49:11,963 --> 01:49:12,803
[SPEAKER_33]: Hello, Alex.

1227
01:49:12,903 --> 01:49:16,345
[SPEAKER_33]: I live at 30 Wright Avenue.

1228
01:49:16,365 --> 01:49:19,727
[SPEAKER_33]: Can you hear me okay?

1229
01:49:20,433 --> 01:49:21,694
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, whenever you're ready.

1230
01:49:22,134 --> 01:49:24,576
[SPEAKER_33]: Yeah, I'll be brief.

1231
01:49:25,096 --> 01:49:28,459
[SPEAKER_33]: But I just wanted to speak in favor and support of the shelter.

1232
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:31,041
[SPEAKER_33]: Just encourage people to have a little bit of perspective.

1233
01:49:32,742 --> 01:49:40,488
[SPEAKER_33]: Domestic violence shelter for women and children is pretty obviously a good and noble use of this space in our city, which is limited.

1234
01:49:40,508 --> 01:49:45,071
[SPEAKER_33]: And on its face, this is something that folks should support.

1235
01:49:46,492 --> 01:49:49,153
[SPEAKER_33]: These people's lives are more important than parking.

1236
01:49:50,114 --> 01:49:55,977
[SPEAKER_33]: And they're more important than, you know, nitty, these, you know, itty bitty things that can obviously be solved later.

1237
01:49:56,658 --> 01:50:01,721
[SPEAKER_33]: So I support the shelter and I would encourage people to look past parking and think about improving people's lives.

1238
01:50:01,861 --> 01:50:02,161
[SPEAKER_33]: Thank you.

1239
01:50:03,902 --> 01:50:05,003
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for the feedback, Alex.

1240
01:50:20,685 --> 01:50:24,446
[SPEAKER_01]: I just have a few questions.

1241
01:50:24,547 --> 01:50:26,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I understand the presenter correctly?

1242
01:50:26,788 --> 01:50:31,890
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to teach commercial driving to people who the presenter stated not one of them own a car.

1243
01:50:32,231 --> 01:50:34,532
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is, if the facility open today.

1244
01:50:35,152 --> 01:50:39,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Forget the tenants or the students, where would the teacher park his car or his commercial truck?

1245
01:50:39,955 --> 01:50:46,899
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the applicant could tell us at what speed the shuttle bus throws people out of it as it doesn't have a parking spot, or is that in the traffic study?

1246
01:50:47,299 --> 01:50:52,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, I'd like to know who is the city peer reviewer for the traffic and parking studies?

1247
01:50:52,622 --> 01:50:52,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1248
01:50:57,425 --> 01:51:00,207
[SPEAKER_22]: I think I may have froze, but Ella, I did hear your question.

1249
01:51:00,447 --> 01:51:01,447
[SPEAKER_22]: Can you all still hear me?

1250
01:51:01,467 --> 01:51:03,028
[SPEAKER_41]: Yes.

1251
01:51:03,889 --> 01:51:04,009
Okay.

1252
01:51:06,182 --> 01:51:07,943
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for your feedback, Ella.

1253
01:51:09,144 --> 01:51:21,974
[SPEAKER_22]: I may leave and come back and see if that helps with my frozen issue, but should I delegate to Peter as clerk while I troubleshoot a little bit?

1254
01:51:22,794 --> 01:51:23,375
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm so sorry.

1255
01:51:28,659 --> 01:51:30,340
[SPEAKER_14]: Should we take a minute recess or?

1256
01:51:31,041 --> 01:51:32,061
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, maybe those two.

1257
01:51:32,101 --> 01:51:33,642
[SPEAKER_22]: That way you hear all the testimony.

1258
01:51:34,223 --> 01:51:35,304
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I'm so sorry.

1259
01:51:36,763 --> 01:51:38,083
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to start restarting now.

1260
01:51:38,323 --> 01:51:38,763
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you all.

1261
01:51:41,484 --> 01:51:42,724
[SPEAKER_10]: We could take a two-minute recess.

1262
01:51:42,764 --> 01:51:43,564
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be great.

1263
01:51:49,025 --> 01:51:49,245
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

1264
01:51:49,585 --> 01:51:52,506
[SPEAKER_22]: I really appreciate everybody's patience with that, the joy of technology.

1265
01:51:54,686 --> 01:51:57,187
[SPEAKER_22]: We had some hands up.

1266
01:51:57,287 --> 01:51:59,467
[SPEAKER_22]: Danielle, do you have the original order for those?

1267
01:52:00,267 --> 01:52:01,147
[SPEAKER_14]: The order remains.

1268
01:52:01,227 --> 01:52:03,488
[SPEAKER_14]: So the next one is Mike O'Brien.

1269
01:52:04,108 --> 01:52:04,208
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

1270
01:52:04,694 --> 01:52:06,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Mike, can you please state your name and address for the record?

1271
01:52:07,937 --> 01:52:10,659
[SPEAKER_41]: Sure, Mike O'Brien, and I reside at 1 Sinclair Road.

1272
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:20,947
[SPEAKER_41]: I think I can appreciate the intention of the proposed shelter, education center.

1273
01:52:21,688 --> 01:52:28,553
[SPEAKER_41]: I can even appreciate not having a building next door that's not vacant as it's been for the last couple of years.

1274
01:52:28,613 --> 01:52:32,817
[SPEAKER_41]: I can even appreciate the developer looking for some return on his investment.

1275
01:52:33,758 --> 01:52:34,879
[SPEAKER_41]: for purchasing that building.

1276
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:38,943
[SPEAKER_41]: But I would ask a couple questions, I guess.

1277
01:52:39,544 --> 01:52:52,958
[SPEAKER_41]: One, a little more clarity, and I apologize, I came to this meeting late, I didn't resume, but a little more clarity and transparency, I think, for developers to whether this was kind of the intention the entire time or

1278
01:52:54,187 --> 01:53:03,052
[SPEAKER_41]: was plan A, no go, and now plan B is now an attempt to get some return on the investment of purchasing the building next door.

1279
01:53:03,072 --> 01:53:13,978
[SPEAKER_41]: And to that end, it seems like this is a plan that hasn't been well developed, at least from what I've heard here on this conference so far.

1280
01:53:14,618 --> 01:53:26,402
[SPEAKER_41]: So, with the six month timeline I'd say, what exactly is the rush in terms of I'd rather see this, if it's going to get done get done right, rather than a quick turnaround here.

1281
01:53:26,962 --> 01:53:31,944
[SPEAKER_41]: And I know there's been a traffic study but there hasn't been a study as to the community impact.

1282
01:53:32,904 --> 01:53:38,745
[SPEAKER_41]: you know, be it property value, crime stats, et cetera, et cetera.

1283
01:53:39,526 --> 01:53:45,707
[SPEAKER_41]: Traffic studies all well and good, but I'm much more concerned about how this addition would affect the community overall.

1284
01:53:46,567 --> 01:53:46,867
[SPEAKER_41]: Thank you.

1285
01:53:48,808 --> 01:53:49,828
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mike, for the feedback.

1286
01:53:51,928 --> 01:53:56,809
[SPEAKER_14]: Madam Chair, I just want to state that I believe that this is a new property owner.

1287
01:53:56,850 --> 01:53:58,050
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not the previous one.

1288
01:54:00,909 --> 01:54:02,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Director Hunt might be able to add to that.

1289
01:54:02,911 --> 01:54:09,656
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to clear that up because I think that it's incorrect.

1290
01:54:10,517 --> 01:54:13,420
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to clarify that.

1291
01:54:14,541 --> 01:54:21,947
[SPEAKER_14]: The next speaker on the list is Councilor George Scarpelli.

1292
01:54:24,229 --> 01:54:25,510
[SPEAKER_22]: Welcome Councilor Scarpelli.

1293
01:54:25,850 --> 01:54:27,432
[SPEAKER_22]: Please state your name and guess for the record.

1294
01:54:28,593 --> 01:54:34,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, George Scarpelli 27 Butler Street so not only city council but also a neighbor.

1295
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:45,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I've received multiple phone calls from many, many residents and, and again, the, the, the cause is noble, and I don't think anybody's going to deny that.

1296
01:54:46,110 --> 01:54:57,674
[SPEAKER_02]: but to the call that was on earlier of this being something positive for the quality of life of those people that will be attending that property.

1297
01:54:58,074 --> 01:55:03,336
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality of life of our residents I think are more important right now because again I think that

1298
01:55:05,096 --> 01:55:10,803
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the lack of communication from the butters and not understanding what's been happening.

1299
01:55:10,863 --> 01:55:15,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the speed of this after an election, I think, is really taking people off.

1300
01:55:15,908 --> 01:55:21,875
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the biggest question that residents that have shared with me that they want to be to ask is.

1301
01:55:23,235 --> 01:55:29,017
[SPEAKER_02]: that the traffic study really hasn't been a thorough traffic study.

1302
01:55:29,057 --> 01:55:42,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is where the city has to get involved, and we have to ask our traffic engineer to put a plan in place not coming from the people that are trying to develop the area, but something that is looking out for our residents.

1303
01:55:42,562 --> 01:55:43,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that'll be important.

1304
01:55:44,282 --> 01:55:45,623
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's also important that

1305
01:55:46,843 --> 01:55:56,090
[SPEAKER_02]: that we understand what has tried to go in here in the past, and why it was denied in the past, because I believe that in the past, parking issues were a problem.

1306
01:55:56,730 --> 01:56:11,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And then again, I did lose the link, so I'm a little late if anybody mentioned it, but we're also talking about what the archdiocese is going to do with the rectory, with the cafeteria, the gymnasium, what happens if that's

1307
01:56:11,921 --> 01:56:13,984
[SPEAKER_02]: then sold off to another company.

1308
01:56:14,064 --> 01:56:20,311
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think the plan has really been vetted properly to the residents and understand the impact.

1309
01:56:20,351 --> 01:56:30,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, like I said, it's a noble cause, but I think that is it truly beneficial for families that will be going in there when you're abutting

1310
01:56:32,285 --> 01:56:41,668
[SPEAKER_02]: the door into a street, into a parking lot that has masses, has funerals all times of the week.

1311
01:56:42,989 --> 01:56:55,053
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there are things that we have to look at as a community, and I would, if we can, Emily, if we can ask the CD board if we can try to maybe table this to another meeting to

1312
01:56:56,673 --> 01:57:06,216
[SPEAKER_02]: really just for the transparency sake that all the residents that haven't been able to be part of this because they just found out about this just recently, I think would be important.

1313
01:57:06,236 --> 01:57:22,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that in fairness to everybody that's involved in the impact that is going to play, I think there are a lot of answers, especially with the traffic impact and the, you know, I listened to the attorney earlier and he spoke about that it's not going to be any people driving.

1314
01:57:22,881 --> 01:57:23,401
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not true.

1315
01:57:23,441 --> 01:57:23,881
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that.

1316
01:57:24,970 --> 01:57:35,854
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that and we need to get a better understanding of what the impact is going to be, especially around the neighbors that are above that, the location because there truly is no parking.

1317
01:57:35,994 --> 01:57:39,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we see it, and especially if there is a mass going on.

1318
01:57:39,335 --> 01:57:39,675
[SPEAKER_02]: So again,

1319
01:57:40,435 --> 01:57:41,416
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a noble cause.

1320
01:57:41,916 --> 01:57:47,919
[SPEAKER_02]: I, you know, if it was just like the methadone distribution center, it's a noble cause if it's in the right place.

1321
01:57:47,980 --> 01:58:00,086
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, I think this is we really have to look at our traffic to make a to make a feasible and smart decision and then making sure that everybody's involved in this decision when we talk about everybody, I mean, the neighbors.

1322
01:58:00,146 --> 01:58:02,428
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I appreciate all the hard work you guys do.

1323
01:58:02,888 --> 01:58:03,488
[SPEAKER_02]: You're amazing.

1324
01:58:03,508 --> 01:58:04,409
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot going on.

1325
01:58:04,429 --> 01:58:09,352
[SPEAKER_02]: We're hoping that with our new zoning reform coming through, that's going to make everybody's life a lot easier.

1326
01:58:10,832 --> 01:58:12,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank you for your time, everyone.

1327
01:58:13,153 --> 01:58:14,474
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1328
01:58:14,494 --> 01:58:16,174
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate you joining the call.

1329
01:58:19,655 --> 01:58:20,356
[SPEAKER_22]: Emily Fishman.

1330
01:58:21,996 --> 01:58:22,476
[SPEAKER_22]: Hi, Emily.

1331
01:58:23,257 --> 01:58:24,697
[SPEAKER_22]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1332
01:58:24,717 --> 01:58:25,878
[SPEAKER_35]: Hi, Emily.

1333
01:58:27,858 --> 01:58:28,198
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1334
01:58:28,558 --> 01:58:29,779
[SPEAKER_35]: My name is Emily Fishman.

1335
01:58:29,839 --> 01:58:31,419
[SPEAKER_35]: I live at 1 Chestnut Street.

1336
01:58:33,396 --> 01:58:40,720
[SPEAKER_35]: Also for the record, my spouse Ari Fishman is on the CBD, but I'm speaking from my own views.

1337
01:58:43,741 --> 01:58:47,143
[SPEAKER_35]: The abutters and neighbors have obviously voiced legitimate questions.

1338
01:58:48,044 --> 01:58:57,488
[SPEAKER_35]: I was a little bit surprised to hear the Councilor just now talk about whether a church would be a good neighbor for residents of this building.

1339
01:58:57,869 --> 01:59:02,451
[SPEAKER_35]: I feel like if we're concerned about that, maybe we're not discussing this in good faith

1340
01:59:04,965 --> 01:59:11,773
[SPEAKER_35]: But, you know, I have some information from my professional life as a teacher and from my personal experiences with folks who've worked in DV shelters.

1341
01:59:11,853 --> 01:59:19,702
[SPEAKER_35]: Funding for students does not fall on the receiving district when a child is placed in shelter.

1342
01:59:21,374 --> 01:59:38,579
[SPEAKER_35]: Residents of shelters do tend to be extremely thoughtful neighbors and very respectful of the area because the requirements of staying in shelter are very stringent and they obviously need to be there otherwise they wouldn't be.

1343
01:59:38,679 --> 01:59:40,379
[SPEAKER_35]: No one wants to be in a DV shelter.

1344
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:43,940
[SPEAKER_35]: It's clear that there are important details to be worked out.

1345
01:59:43,960 --> 01:59:46,981
[SPEAKER_35]: I'm interested in Walid and what a couple other people said about

1346
01:59:47,692 --> 01:59:56,921
[SPEAKER_35]: the nature of this developer, it seems like there needs to be a lot more first-in-person conversations with folks in the neighborhood, both the abutters and the people a little bit farther out.

1347
01:59:59,903 --> 02:00:11,554
[SPEAKER_35]: A lot of us, especially today, coming off of yesterday, are worried about how to care for each other in a local way, given uncertainty about what's happening in sort of the bigger political picture, and not

1348
02:00:12,371 --> 02:00:19,136
[SPEAKER_35]: constantly pushing services and ways to care for community into other people's neighborhoods is how we do that.

1349
02:00:20,337 --> 02:00:23,939
[SPEAKER_35]: We want to have a community where there are resources for vulnerable residents.

1350
02:00:24,440 --> 02:00:30,624
[SPEAKER_35]: We can say we want this shelter, yes, but we need to hear more creative solutions for parking and pedestrian safety.

1351
02:00:31,264 --> 02:00:37,269
[SPEAKER_35]: But I don't like the tone that we support services for people as long as they're located elsewhere.

1352
02:00:37,289 --> 02:00:38,670
[SPEAKER_21]: 10 seconds.

1353
02:00:44,438 --> 02:00:45,078
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Emily.

1354
02:00:45,098 --> 02:00:46,879
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate the feedback.

1355
02:00:55,261 --> 02:00:56,201
[SPEAKER_14]: Daria Matos.

1356
02:01:01,422 --> 02:01:03,403
[SPEAKER_22]: Daria, please state your name and address for the record.

1357
02:01:04,452 --> 02:01:05,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, this is Darian Matos.

1358
02:01:05,653 --> 02:01:07,995
[SPEAKER_13]: I live at 54 Logan Avenue in Medford.

1359
02:01:08,015 --> 02:01:09,496
[SPEAKER_13]: I grew up on St.

1360
02:01:09,516 --> 02:01:13,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Francis Street, so I currently have family members that still are there.

1361
02:01:13,958 --> 02:01:17,221
[SPEAKER_13]: My question is, I have two questions actually.

1362
02:01:17,661 --> 02:01:20,163
[SPEAKER_13]: So under the Dover Act here,

1363
02:01:20,823 --> 02:01:31,206
[SPEAKER_13]: The children that will be in the building, I know some people have already brought this up, but will they be homeschooled under the Dover Act or will they be integrated into our school systems?

1364
02:01:32,046 --> 02:01:39,528
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that we are already overrun, as many people have said, so if it is under Dover, why wouldn't they be homeschooled there?

1365
02:01:40,508 --> 02:01:45,990
[SPEAKER_13]: My other question is, I happen to know that the interior of this building is in complete distress.

1366
02:01:46,931 --> 02:01:49,934
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, there is a significant amount of asbestos in the building.

1367
02:01:50,395 --> 02:01:54,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so what is the remediation plan and the construction plan?

1368
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,282
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you said you'd be up and running in 6 months.

1369
02:01:56,943 --> 02:02:03,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I guess that would be, you know, some information that would be important to know as well since it is.

1370
02:02:04,404 --> 02:02:05,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, asbestos.

1371
02:02:05,805 --> 02:02:20,351
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and I'd like to also mention that, you know, I agree with Scarpelli, um, how he mentioned that, you know, this is a noble cause, and I do agree that there are, you know, many other locations in Medford that it might better be suited for.

1372
02:02:20,371 --> 02:02:25,013
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, the people that have all talked in favor of it don't live near here.

1373
02:02:25,033 --> 02:02:26,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, everyone's across the city.

1374
02:02:26,973 --> 02:02:32,596
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, I think, you know, just kind of reiterating that the parking is already a disaster.

1375
02:02:33,316 --> 02:02:34,496
[SPEAKER_13]: It is so hard to park there.

1376
02:02:34,516 --> 02:02:39,938
[SPEAKER_13]: I have two young children and to get to my dad's is, you know, it's such a headache already.

1377
02:02:40,158 --> 02:02:47,760
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think adding more people to this already congested neighborhood is not the correct location for this, again, noble cause.

1378
02:02:48,120 --> 02:02:48,501
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1379
02:02:50,341 --> 02:02:50,961
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Dari.

1380
02:02:51,241 --> 02:02:52,282
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate the insight.

1381
02:02:55,663 --> 02:02:58,784
[SPEAKER_22]: And I see Councilor Scarpelli has raised their hand again.

1382
02:03:01,064 --> 02:03:09,609
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we have any other members of the public that would like to comment before we give Councilor Scarpelli the courtesy of a second comment as a councilor for the city?

1383
02:03:11,310 --> 02:03:24,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair, actually I have one that a resident told me she couldn't speak out loud in her location, but she authorized me to read it and give her name and address for the record.

1384
02:03:26,523 --> 02:03:32,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Her name is Shalise Juliet Rowell, and her address is 35 Columbia Road in Medford.

1385
02:03:32,768 --> 02:03:38,471
[SPEAKER_10]: And she says, I'm a Medford resident, and I'm strongly in support of a domestic violence shelter in our community.

1386
02:03:38,972 --> 02:03:50,700
[SPEAKER_10]: As a child in Georgia, my mother volunteered at a rape crisis center, and I loved visiting a space that provided care and direct services to people experiencing sexual and gender based violence.

1387
02:03:51,120 --> 02:03:56,504
[SPEAKER_10]: I would be proud for Medford to provide a shelter for individuals and families experiencing domestic violence.

1388
02:03:58,425 --> 02:04:01,367
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Alicia, and I appreciate their vulnerability in their comment.

1389
02:04:04,289 --> 02:04:08,171
[SPEAKER_22]: Any other written or submitted comments of the public?

1390
02:04:10,853 --> 02:04:14,956
[SPEAKER_14]: We did receive an email that I

1391
02:04:16,655 --> 02:04:22,279
[SPEAKER_14]: put into your meeting packets, like this afternoon.

1392
02:04:23,219 --> 02:04:28,603
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if that individual was also in attendance tonight.

1393
02:04:31,585 --> 02:04:35,587
[SPEAKER_10]: I do believe that that was one of the residents who spoke this evening.

1394
02:04:37,128 --> 02:04:38,489
[SPEAKER_22]: That was my understanding as well.

1395
02:04:44,478 --> 02:04:45,379
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1396
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:47,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1397
02:04:48,021 --> 02:04:48,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to take long enough.

1398
02:04:49,462 --> 02:04:58,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, I know we've had a tough 24 hours, whether you were for or against an override, especially what's happened nationally.

1399
02:04:58,167 --> 02:05:00,769
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been a tough, tough last 24 hours.

1400
02:05:00,809 --> 02:05:08,134
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to make sure that I clear something that a caller mentioned, that if I said anything that

1401
02:05:13,958 --> 02:05:19,822
[SPEAKER_02]: meant that I believe the caller said that the I said that the church wouldn't be good neighbors.

1402
02:05:19,882 --> 02:05:25,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure that I never said that I would never say that I think the church.

1403
02:05:25,446 --> 02:05:26,907
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been a person at St.

1404
02:05:26,947 --> 02:05:27,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Francis my whole life.

1405
02:05:28,868 --> 02:05:31,010
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been accommodating to everybody and anybody.

1406
02:05:31,070 --> 02:05:33,051
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think they'd be great neighbors with anybody.

1407
02:05:33,231 --> 02:05:36,413
[SPEAKER_02]: So, again, just want to clear that up.

1408
02:05:36,493 --> 02:05:36,754
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't

1409
02:05:37,414 --> 02:05:43,221
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's it's it's too tough of a time right now to keep bringing up negativity.

1410
02:05:43,261 --> 02:05:53,753
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anybody took anything I said and something in a negative manner, I just want to make sure that I corrected that to make sure that we're all trying to stay positive and moving forward.

1411
02:05:53,773 --> 02:05:54,514
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Emily.

1412
02:05:54,574 --> 02:05:55,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

1413
02:05:55,955 --> 02:05:57,057
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1414
02:05:58,018 --> 02:06:04,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair, I got one more direct message from somebody who said that they are not able to raise their hand.

1415
02:06:05,903 --> 02:06:07,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Humayun Morshed.

1416
02:06:07,504 --> 02:06:11,586
[SPEAKER_22]: We can ask you to unmute.

1417
02:06:11,606 --> 02:06:18,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Humayun Morshed and I live in 30 St.

1418
02:06:18,430 --> 02:06:19,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Francis Street.

1419
02:06:20,142 --> 02:06:24,104
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pretty close next street over.

1420
02:06:25,645 --> 02:06:34,129
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely, definitely love to, I mean, oppose these proposals, because whoever's supporting, none of them live in this neighborhood.

1421
02:06:34,709 --> 02:06:40,272
[SPEAKER_00]: We are direct, I mean, we have to deal with this.

1422
02:06:41,752 --> 02:06:43,633
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be on the sufferer one.

1423
02:06:43,653 --> 02:06:46,715
[SPEAKER_00]: So because of this is very tight space,

1424
02:06:47,512 --> 02:06:49,593
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the concern is the noise.

1425
02:06:49,974 --> 02:06:51,074
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about the kids.

1426
02:06:51,155 --> 02:06:51,995
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three kids.

1427
02:06:52,836 --> 02:06:57,699
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking right now, that many kids, where are they going to go outside?

1428
02:06:57,779 --> 02:06:59,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Forget about any other places.

1429
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:02,062
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the summertime, they have to come outside.

1430
02:07:02,682 --> 02:07:04,623
[SPEAKER_00]: It will be a chaos, whole this area.

1431
02:07:05,344 --> 02:07:09,667
[SPEAKER_00]: So all my neighbors already raised great points, great concern.

1432
02:07:10,307 --> 02:07:13,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Only one thing I just want to say, this is not the right place.

1433
02:07:14,930 --> 02:07:15,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1434
02:07:15,290 --> 02:07:15,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.

1435
02:07:18,365 --> 02:07:18,685
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1436
02:07:19,085 --> 02:07:29,549
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, who may appreciate your, uh, your comment, Danielle or Alicia, are there any other, um, first time commenters from the public?

1437
02:07:29,969 --> 02:07:37,571
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, if we encourage all feedback, um, you know, there's an email address that you can share feedback with that's been posted in the chat.

1438
02:07:38,532 --> 02:07:42,093
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, so we'd encourage everyone to share feedback through that email address.

1439
02:07:42,153 --> 02:07:45,214
[SPEAKER_22]: If you have additional comments and have already spoken.

1440
02:07:47,120 --> 02:07:52,643
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't see any hands raised of folks who have not already spoken tonight.

1441
02:07:53,223 --> 02:07:53,463
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1442
02:07:55,064 --> 02:07:55,705
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Danielle.

1443
02:08:00,967 --> 02:08:05,069
[SPEAKER_22]: So at this point, we're going to be closing the public comment period for this meeting.

1444
02:08:06,230 --> 02:08:14,934
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to give the applicant a response or an opportunity to respond to some of the comments that have been made, realizing that there is a significant number of comments.

1445
02:08:19,205 --> 02:08:22,386
[SPEAKER_22]: We'd like to hear some insights in response.

1446
02:08:23,687 --> 02:08:25,387
[SPEAKER_40]: OK, I'll do my best.

1447
02:08:27,188 --> 02:08:41,153
[SPEAKER_40]: First and foremost, this team is not the team who previously appeared before this city to propose luxury condominiums.

1448
02:08:41,893 --> 02:08:48,616
[SPEAKER_40]: And then I don't know if that team then changed their mind and said, well, in that case, we're going to do a sober home or we're going to do

1449
02:08:50,340 --> 02:08:54,602
[SPEAKER_40]: a shelter or whatever they're going to, that is not the person who's in front of you.

1450
02:08:55,182 --> 02:09:05,487
[SPEAKER_40]: That was some predecessor applicant who sold the property to my clients.

1451
02:09:06,427 --> 02:09:27,016
[SPEAKER_40]: my clients are coming in, this is their first proposal, so any animus directed towards them, some of the comments that were made towards them just in the last few minutes are unfortunate and inaccurate, first and foremost.

1452
02:09:27,656 --> 02:09:34,719
[SPEAKER_40]: Second of all, I'd love to debate the legal points that were made by

1453
02:09:37,289 --> 02:09:38,910
[SPEAKER_40]: the participants on this phone call.

1454
02:09:39,590 --> 02:09:42,471
[SPEAKER_40]: But I don't think this is the appropriate forum.

1455
02:09:43,191 --> 02:09:50,393
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll read you one one quote that might help people from one of the cases that I like that I just put my hands on.

1456
02:09:51,013 --> 02:10:06,658
[SPEAKER_40]: Teaching individuals a basic understanding on how to cope with everyday problems and to maintain oneself in a society to maintain oneself in a society is incontestably

1457
02:10:07,701 --> 02:10:09,062
[SPEAKER_40]: an education process.

1458
02:10:10,664 --> 02:10:14,828
[SPEAKER_40]: This is why, for example, sober homes would be a legal use here.

1459
02:10:16,610 --> 02:10:18,932
[SPEAKER_40]: Look, I live in a community.

1460
02:10:19,753 --> 02:10:21,614
[SPEAKER_40]: I used to be a city councilor a long time ago.

1461
02:10:22,615 --> 02:10:23,636
[SPEAKER_40]: We all live in communities.

1462
02:10:23,656 --> 02:10:27,460
[SPEAKER_40]: We understand that people have concerns about what's in their immediate midst.

1463
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:28,120
[SPEAKER_40]: We get it.

1464
02:10:30,149 --> 02:10:34,752
[SPEAKER_40]: That is why there was a deliberate effort by this group to knock on doors and have conversations.

1465
02:10:34,852 --> 02:10:36,173
[SPEAKER_40]: I appreciate what Marge said.

1466
02:10:36,873 --> 02:10:39,395
[SPEAKER_40]: Marge said she wanted to get to know the neighbors a little bit better.

1467
02:10:39,415 --> 02:10:41,916
[SPEAKER_40]: She wanted to get this group to know this group a little bit better.

1468
02:10:42,297 --> 02:10:43,197
[SPEAKER_40]: This group agrees.

1469
02:10:43,637 --> 02:10:46,039
[SPEAKER_40]: This group wants to get to know this community better.

1470
02:10:46,659 --> 02:10:52,703
[SPEAKER_40]: I think what people will find is that it's the most dangerous word in the English language is them.

1471
02:10:53,564 --> 02:10:53,804
[SPEAKER_40]: Them.

1472
02:10:54,504 --> 02:10:56,666
[SPEAKER_40]: What people will find when they

1473
02:10:59,312 --> 02:11:06,692
[SPEAKER_40]: Dig into the issue of domestic violence and while he shared his own experiences and we appreciate that is that.

1474
02:11:07,942 --> 02:11:15,783
[SPEAKER_40]: people on this call and family members and friends and are the people who will be living in this property.

1475
02:11:16,504 --> 02:11:24,905
[SPEAKER_40]: And there are no properties like this anywhere because people don't want a homeless shelter in their backyard.

1476
02:11:25,565 --> 02:11:35,367
[SPEAKER_40]: Before this meeting, someone dropped a flyer to the different houses and said, please show up to stop a homeless shelter from coming into your neighborhood.

1477
02:11:36,693 --> 02:11:43,357
[SPEAKER_40]: Now I get it, people look at that, they get angry, they think someone's trying to put something over them and ruin their neighborhood.

1478
02:11:45,298 --> 02:11:53,823
[SPEAKER_40]: My clients knocked on doors and spoke to the abutters and asked if they might be willing, and not because we need parking.

1479
02:11:54,890 --> 02:11:56,751
[SPEAKER_40]: because there's a perception that we need parking.

1480
02:11:57,351 --> 02:12:15,121
[SPEAKER_40]: You've heard professionals who recently formed this company to work with us, and that's why that entity was fresh in the Secretary of State's office, not because we've created some elaborate scheme to somehow defraud the participants of this phone call to

1481
02:12:16,113 --> 02:12:41,470
[SPEAKER_40]: somehow bring novice people into this space to try to tell you that we want to pretend that we want to create a domestic violence shelter only so that we can bait and switch it and somehow sneak by the city of Medford that we're actually trying to build, what, a homeless shelter or build luxury housing, but we came in pretending

1482
02:12:42,627 --> 02:12:45,089
[SPEAKER_40]: So no, that's not the case here.

1483
02:12:45,129 --> 02:12:50,954
[SPEAKER_40]: You have seasoned professionals who've been in this work for decades, doing this work for decades.

1484
02:12:51,814 --> 02:13:02,283
[SPEAKER_40]: Taisha created an entity for this project here, the Halo House, to be the nonprofit entity that serves this community.

1485
02:13:03,724 --> 02:13:07,987
[SPEAKER_40]: The owners of the property, Andrew Litchfield and Steve Sueda,

1486
02:13:09,161 --> 02:13:26,388
[SPEAKER_40]: have own other types of this type of housing in their own capacity as real estate developers would own the actual facility and because of that there would be no tax break associated with it even though a non-profit is the tenant who rents the space out.

1487
02:13:28,248 --> 02:13:31,590
[SPEAKER_40]: And the goal here is to

1488
02:13:38,701 --> 02:13:46,346
[SPEAKER_40]: further the lives of these individuals who in many cases are the people that live in this very community.

1489
02:13:48,447 --> 02:13:50,468
[SPEAKER_40]: Let me try to hit some of the specific questions.

1490
02:13:50,569 --> 02:13:52,710
[SPEAKER_40]: I've mentioned the property taxes, they will be paid.

1491
02:13:54,140 --> 02:13:59,283
[SPEAKER_40]: Someone said that we're hiding the number of rooms, that before it was 40 and now it's 37.

1492
02:13:59,643 --> 02:14:03,905
[SPEAKER_40]: As I said, there are 37 rooms and three flex rooms for a total of 40.

1493
02:14:04,225 --> 02:14:07,427
[SPEAKER_40]: Those three flex rooms can be used as an office.

1494
02:14:07,767 --> 02:14:09,988
[SPEAKER_40]: They could be used as swing space.

1495
02:14:10,008 --> 02:14:14,090
[SPEAKER_40]: They could be used as a flexible space for the facility.

1496
02:14:14,210 --> 02:14:15,891
[SPEAKER_40]: So it's a total of 40 rooms.

1497
02:14:16,411 --> 02:14:17,532
[SPEAKER_40]: How many people will be in that room?

1498
02:14:17,772 --> 02:14:21,254
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, if you have a mother and an infant, that's gonna be two people in a room.

1499
02:14:21,774 --> 02:14:32,244
[SPEAKER_40]: If you have a mother and, as I said earlier, a kid, if that kid is, say, seven or eight, the kid will live in the room next door and there will be a door in between them.

1500
02:14:33,023 --> 02:14:40,787
[SPEAKER_40]: What is the total capacity of the building is a process that gets worked out between our architect and your building department.

1501
02:14:41,027 --> 02:14:51,032
[SPEAKER_40]: And your building department provides a number of what's legally allowed based on the construction level documents that are provided to your building department from our architect.

1502
02:14:51,972 --> 02:14:54,054
[SPEAKER_40]: Is the building handicap accessible?

1503
02:14:54,775 --> 02:14:55,415
[SPEAKER_40]: Of course it is.

1504
02:14:55,696 --> 02:14:58,278
[SPEAKER_40]: We have to meet the accessibility guidelines.

1505
02:14:58,618 --> 02:15:05,265
[SPEAKER_40]: This is a, I don't know, a million plus renovation that triggers a certain level of accessibility guidelines.

1506
02:15:06,005 --> 02:15:08,788
[SPEAKER_40]: Our architect fully understands that and comprehends that.

1507
02:15:09,068 --> 02:15:11,551
[SPEAKER_40]: Your building officials understand that.

1508
02:15:11,951 --> 02:15:13,312
[SPEAKER_40]: And there are different levels of that.

1509
02:15:13,592 --> 02:15:15,774
[SPEAKER_40]: This building is going to be completely sprinklered.

1510
02:15:16,415 --> 02:15:22,218
[SPEAKER_40]: those sprinklers will create a certain fire profession rating that currently doesn't exist in this building.

1511
02:15:23,139 --> 02:15:34,645
[SPEAKER_40]: Whether or not an elevator would be needed here, if an elevator would be mandatory due to some sort of handicap accessible, some AAA requirement, some accessibility requirement, then we would put elevators in there.

1512
02:15:35,145 --> 02:15:43,589
[SPEAKER_40]: But our understanding, our architect's understanding, who's very good, Eric Zacherson, does a lot of work in throughout Massachusetts, including the city of Boston, is

1513
02:15:45,587 --> 02:15:47,348
[SPEAKER_40]: does not believe that we need elevators in this space.

1514
02:15:48,769 --> 02:15:49,789
[SPEAKER_40]: We would otherwise put them in.

1515
02:15:51,070 --> 02:16:01,475
[SPEAKER_40]: You can achieve the accessibility guidelines by creating accessible units on the ground floor, which is what we're proposing, and then access to those areas on the ground floor.

1516
02:16:02,660 --> 02:16:08,283
[SPEAKER_40]: the fire lane, the other fire issues, the suppression systems, the upgrading of our systems.

1517
02:16:08,723 --> 02:16:11,024
[SPEAKER_40]: All of those things aren't something that we propose.

1518
02:16:11,444 --> 02:16:17,548
[SPEAKER_40]: Those are things that the Massachusetts State Building Code propose and the fire code proposes and that your building department enforces.

1519
02:16:17,668 --> 02:16:21,930
[SPEAKER_40]: And of course, we will have to comply with every single one of those things.

1520
02:16:22,887 --> 02:16:27,191
[SPEAKER_40]: But I think at the heart of this matter is this question of use.

1521
02:16:27,992 --> 02:16:36,760
[SPEAKER_40]: And when my client knocked on the doors of some neighbors to say, look, do you have this parcel that's sitting here empty?

1522
02:16:37,361 --> 02:16:38,002
[SPEAKER_40]: Would you rent it?

1523
02:16:39,121 --> 02:16:39,922
[SPEAKER_40]: It's a fair question.

1524
02:16:39,962 --> 02:16:55,136
[SPEAKER_40]: We're being asked at this meeting, we're being told at this meeting that this is all transportation matter, that this is all about parking and traffic, even though we've told you that in our professional experience, our clients do not have cars or bring cars.

1525
02:16:57,623 --> 02:17:01,046
[SPEAKER_40]: But we do see the value of having three or four spaces.

1526
02:17:01,907 --> 02:17:03,148
[SPEAKER_40]: It would be great to have that.

1527
02:17:03,188 --> 02:17:04,630
[SPEAKER_40]: We don't have that on this parcel.

1528
02:17:04,650 --> 02:17:07,493
[SPEAKER_40]: The priests didn't or the nuns didn't have that on that parcel.

1529
02:17:07,533 --> 02:17:12,658
[SPEAKER_40]: Yeah, they weren't driving places, but they had people coming there to help them to do things for the facility.

1530
02:17:12,818 --> 02:17:13,659
[SPEAKER_40]: Would be great to have it.

1531
02:17:14,660 --> 02:17:19,925
[SPEAKER_40]: The response that we received is that we would get parking if we agreed to do luxury condominiums.

1532
02:17:21,422 --> 02:17:30,387
[SPEAKER_40]: If we did luxury condominiums, then yeah, a deal could be had to create parking spaces, to use those parking spaces for this facility.

1533
02:17:30,687 --> 02:17:33,529
[SPEAKER_40]: But people don't want a homeless shelter next to them.

1534
02:17:33,749 --> 02:17:35,050
[SPEAKER_40]: That is the issue.

1535
02:17:35,130 --> 02:17:36,411
[SPEAKER_40]: That's what we're hearing.

1536
02:17:37,111 --> 02:17:43,455
[SPEAKER_40]: And I think it's so easy to say that this is a homeless shelter and to use that to stigmatize what's being proposed here.

1537
02:17:43,855 --> 02:17:45,076
[SPEAKER_40]: And that is exactly

1538
02:17:45,796 --> 02:17:58,061
[SPEAKER_40]: why we have laws on the books like the Dover Amendment that protect against these types of uses because of the prejudice that the use often entails.

1539
02:18:01,022 --> 02:18:03,323
[SPEAKER_40]: Will the kids go to school or will they have to

1540
02:18:04,818 --> 02:18:05,660
[SPEAKER_40]: Be homeschooled.

1541
02:18:06,742 --> 02:18:10,649
[SPEAKER_40]: The kids will have access to the school system.

1542
02:18:11,511 --> 02:18:15,077
[SPEAKER_40]: If the kid wants, if their parent wants to homeschool them, is that parent's right?

1543
02:18:15,097 --> 02:18:16,039
[SPEAKER_40]: Of course it is.

1544
02:18:17,665 --> 02:18:19,387
[SPEAKER_40]: There are parks in this community.

1545
02:18:21,008 --> 02:18:22,909
[SPEAKER_40]: Hickey Park is a park nearby.

1546
02:18:23,449 --> 02:18:28,793
[SPEAKER_40]: That's where these kids will likely go, and they'll be supervised accordingly.

1547
02:18:28,813 --> 02:18:39,799
[SPEAKER_40]: In fact, they'll be better supervised because of the resources that this facility has, in many cases, than in some of the cases that they're in right now, in an under-housed or an under-parent situation.

1548
02:18:42,301 --> 02:18:45,023
[SPEAKER_40]: Are they Americans or are they illegals?

1549
02:18:49,539 --> 02:18:58,624
[SPEAKER_40]: The need right now in this country is to provide a resource for battered women and their children.

1550
02:18:59,184 --> 02:19:02,386
[SPEAKER_40]: And I suspect that need is a worldwide need.

1551
02:19:03,286 --> 02:19:09,690
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll allow Ruth and Taisha to fill in the question on that question, to answer that question.

1552
02:19:11,676 --> 02:19:13,739
[SPEAKER_40]: No one's going to be thrown out of a shuttle bus.

1553
02:19:14,439 --> 02:19:17,443
[SPEAKER_40]: If the city doesn't want us to provide sidewalks on St.

1554
02:19:17,483 --> 02:19:19,986
[SPEAKER_40]: Clair, we won't provide sidewalk on St.

1555
02:19:20,026 --> 02:19:20,306
[SPEAKER_40]: Clair.

1556
02:19:20,867 --> 02:19:24,371
[SPEAKER_40]: The condominium did not provide a sidewalk on St.

1557
02:19:24,411 --> 02:19:24,672
[SPEAKER_40]: Clair.

1558
02:19:25,272 --> 02:19:26,974
[SPEAKER_40]: So I would think this domestic violence

1559
02:19:28,310 --> 02:19:38,293
[SPEAKER_40]: uh resource you know doesn't want to have to invest more money than it does that shouldn't have to invest it has no problem not creating a sidewalk on St.

1560
02:19:38,333 --> 02:19:52,718
[SPEAKER_40]: Clair if that's what the city wants us to do we will comply with whatever the city is asking us to do wants us to do a fire lane then there can be a fire lane there um there are certain requirements too and we're not suggesting that we're going to remove

1561
02:19:53,598 --> 02:19:59,867
[SPEAKER_40]: a fire plug or a fire hydrant, we of course would be fully compliant on all these things.

1562
02:20:02,150 --> 02:20:04,774
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that covers about

1563
02:20:06,308 --> 02:20:07,328
[SPEAKER_40]: about all off-site work.

1564
02:20:08,649 --> 02:20:14,090
[SPEAKER_40]: No one is going to be testing out commercial driving down St.

1565
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:16,450
[SPEAKER_40]: Clair and up the other side streets.

1566
02:20:16,911 --> 02:20:25,073
[SPEAKER_40]: In many of these job destinations, the solar panel, those other types of things, that's why we have the shuttle.

1567
02:20:25,433 --> 02:20:29,814
[SPEAKER_40]: People will get on the shuttle and they'll be taken to these resources.

1568
02:20:30,214 --> 02:20:31,814
[SPEAKER_40]: Not all the resources are coming to us.

1569
02:20:32,194 --> 02:20:32,955
[SPEAKER_40]: Many, many are.

1570
02:20:33,495 --> 02:20:34,575
[SPEAKER_40]: But things like

1571
02:20:35,135 --> 02:20:41,743
[SPEAKER_40]: learning how to drive a commercial vehicle will not be done along the immediate streets of this community.

1572
02:20:41,763 --> 02:20:45,667
[SPEAKER_40]: They will be done in an off-site facility that we would send people to.

1573
02:20:45,687 --> 02:20:50,152
[SPEAKER_40]: I think, Tay, you should put that chat in the comment in the chat.

1574
02:20:50,912 --> 02:20:58,154
[SPEAKER_40]: And let me close just by turning it over to Ruth, if I could, or Taisha, to respond, because this is your life's work.

1575
02:20:58,435 --> 02:21:01,336
[SPEAKER_40]: You've been told that you've just set this up on a sham.

1576
02:21:02,016 --> 02:21:04,357
[SPEAKER_40]: I apologize to you for you having to hear that.

1577
02:21:04,837 --> 02:21:06,377
[SPEAKER_40]: I think you're entitled to a response.

1578
02:21:09,678 --> 02:21:11,899
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Ruth, do you want to lead?

1579
02:21:11,919 --> 02:21:17,281
[SPEAKER_07]: I know definitely I have been dealing with

1580
02:21:18,178 --> 02:21:21,119
[SPEAKER_07]: and have housed hundreds of people.

1581
02:21:22,020 --> 02:21:29,283
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason why I even formed the nonprofit is because this comes from my heart.

1582
02:21:29,984 --> 02:21:43,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I have worked with so many people and had to deal with situations like this, that it's better to house them, to control the environment, and to let the neighbors know that we're here and we care about them.

1583
02:21:44,350 --> 02:21:45,191
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a ruse.

1584
02:21:45,771 --> 02:21:46,912
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not doing anything

1585
02:21:48,699 --> 02:21:51,581
[SPEAKER_07]: to profit because it's a nonprofit.

1586
02:21:51,982 --> 02:21:54,744
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't profit from a nonprofit.

1587
02:21:57,066 --> 02:21:59,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Even me as a tenant, I get a discount.

1588
02:22:00,703 --> 02:22:03,926
[SPEAKER_07]: versus if I was a profit to even rent the property.

1589
02:22:04,647 --> 02:22:09,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Everything from a nonprofit goes back into the nonprofit.

1590
02:22:09,871 --> 02:22:22,843
[SPEAKER_07]: I have partnered with other organizations fiscally to be my fiscal sponsors and to be my partners that have long successful rates.

1591
02:22:23,524 --> 02:22:24,805
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I brought them here.

1592
02:22:25,886 --> 02:22:37,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Ruth on the line, which I will let her talk about her years of experience, but we're not trying to pull anything over the city of Medford.

1593
02:22:38,832 --> 02:22:41,153
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ruth, I will let you talk about everything else.

1594
02:22:42,628 --> 02:22:47,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, thank you, and thank you everyone for their testimonies.

1595
02:22:47,572 --> 02:22:50,354
[SPEAKER_12]: And I just, you know, I'm just taking it all in.

1596
02:22:50,514 --> 02:22:52,616
[SPEAKER_12]: So my name is Ruth Rollins.

1597
02:22:52,856 --> 02:22:57,039
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been working with community for over 30 years.

1598
02:22:57,059 --> 02:22:58,621
[SPEAKER_12]: I too am a survivor.

1599
02:22:59,541 --> 02:23:07,928
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been a domestic violence advocate for over 25 years and had the opportunity of running domestic violence shelters and supervising services.

1600
02:23:08,768 --> 02:23:11,491
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really just want to hold space

1601
02:23:12,723 --> 02:23:17,766
[SPEAKER_12]: for the people that had the courage on this call to talk about how they were impacted by domestic violence.

1602
02:23:18,347 --> 02:23:24,631
[SPEAKER_12]: And I pray that nobody on this call or their family member ever went through what domestic violence is.

1603
02:23:24,711 --> 02:23:26,332
[SPEAKER_12]: But I really wanna speak to the need.

1604
02:23:27,412 --> 02:23:35,578
[SPEAKER_12]: 35% of women and children have been impacted by domestic violence in their lifespan in Massachusetts.

1605
02:23:37,245 --> 02:23:40,508
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand major, major concerns, right?

1606
02:23:40,588 --> 02:23:44,672
[SPEAKER_12]: But what I heard is that, you know, I'll go back a little.

1607
02:23:45,373 --> 02:23:57,865
[SPEAKER_12]: In the last two years, domestic violence has tripled, tripled on the number of services, tripled on the number of people that have been impacted by domestic violence.

1608
02:23:58,646 --> 02:24:04,732
[SPEAKER_12]: There are shelters, but unfortunately, I would hate to be someone fleeing domestic violence in Massachusetts today.

1609
02:24:05,593 --> 02:24:14,861
[SPEAKER_12]: Due to immigration status, due to women being abused, due to men being abused, due to LGBTQ, you know, being abused,

1610
02:24:19,065 --> 02:24:26,753
[SPEAKER_12]: And that there are limited shelters that can support these families to the point that they're not even hotels that people can go in.

1611
02:24:27,314 --> 02:24:28,635
[SPEAKER_12]: So the need is there.

1612
02:24:29,036 --> 02:24:37,645
[SPEAKER_12]: And for me, there's been a lot of conversation in regards to and I say this with all due respect, not in my backyard, not in my backyard.

1613
02:24:38,407 --> 02:24:49,796
[SPEAKER_12]: But we may be the people, we never know when domestic violence hits our door, and we want to offer that same support as the support that we would need for our families.

1614
02:24:50,316 --> 02:24:51,857
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to share that.

1615
02:24:52,558 --> 02:24:59,163
[SPEAKER_12]: Safety is always, always, always a primary factor when you're working with domestic violence.

1616
02:24:59,783 --> 02:25:01,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it written out in stone?

1617
02:25:01,684 --> 02:25:02,984
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it perfect as of yet?

1618
02:25:03,124 --> 02:25:03,324
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1619
02:25:03,664 --> 02:25:09,326
[SPEAKER_12]: It's always the safety of the person that's fleeing an abusive relationship and safety of the resident.

1620
02:25:09,726 --> 02:25:17,968
[SPEAKER_12]: So they have a whole plan that we're going to be working on in regards to working with the Medford Police, working with others that can support this, that we will succeed.

1621
02:25:18,448 --> 02:25:21,990
[SPEAKER_12]: In regards to services, my colleagues said a lot of different things.

1622
02:25:22,110 --> 02:25:22,410
[SPEAKER_12]: You know,

1623
02:25:24,991 --> 02:25:36,202
[SPEAKER_12]: Our first point of contact with services and support is to support and educate these survivors that are fleeing abusive relationships with trauma-informed care.

1624
02:25:36,983 --> 02:25:41,147
[SPEAKER_12]: So, with that being said, that's their first point of contact.

1625
02:25:41,187 --> 02:25:43,209
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it may be education.

1626
02:25:43,409 --> 02:25:44,951
[SPEAKER_12]: It may be tractor trailing.

1627
02:25:45,091 --> 02:25:47,953
[SPEAKER_12]: It may be, are people going to be pulling up in the parking lot?

1628
02:25:48,054 --> 02:25:48,194
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

1629
02:25:49,456 --> 02:25:57,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Our job is to empower them so they could be stable enough to break the cycle of violence for themselves and their children.

1630
02:25:58,679 --> 02:26:06,427
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a lot being said and I'm trying to cover everything, but in terms of program, it's on need basis.

1631
02:26:07,028 --> 02:26:10,732
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not just, and when we talk about immigrants, yes, it's terrible.

1632
02:26:11,052 --> 02:26:13,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Domestic violence has no shade.

1633
02:26:13,214 --> 02:26:16,978
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to say this, and this is based on all my years of experience.

1634
02:26:17,018 --> 02:26:18,159
[SPEAKER_12]: There is no shade.

1635
02:26:18,840 --> 02:26:21,002
[SPEAKER_12]: There is no race.

1636
02:26:22,137 --> 02:26:28,320
[SPEAKER_12]: There is, like, the goal is to support families so we can break the cycle of violence for their children.

1637
02:26:29,020 --> 02:26:29,800
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it perfect?

1638
02:26:29,901 --> 02:26:32,382
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but the need is there.

1639
02:26:32,502 --> 02:26:39,365
[SPEAKER_12]: And I challenge you guys to look into it in regards to services for domestic violence survivors.

1640
02:26:39,985 --> 02:26:45,226
[SPEAKER_12]: people are living in their cars, people don't have anywhere to go, people are living in an emergency room.

1641
02:26:45,827 --> 02:26:47,347
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's definitely a need.

1642
02:26:47,507 --> 02:26:49,388
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there some things that need to be ironed out?

1643
02:26:49,428 --> 02:26:50,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Most definitely.

1644
02:26:50,228 --> 02:26:53,669
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this a great opportunity to service women and children?

1645
02:26:53,689 --> 02:26:57,950
[SPEAKER_12]: And then if we really look up domestic violence or women's shelters,

1646
02:26:58,550 --> 02:27:00,471
[SPEAKER_12]: It's temporary placement.

1647
02:27:00,851 --> 02:27:06,434
[SPEAKER_12]: The goal is to stabilize them and to empower them so they can have long-term housing.

1648
02:27:06,754 --> 02:27:10,956
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's where all the programming will come in, all of the services would come in.

1649
02:27:11,776 --> 02:27:14,077
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is a lot of concern, I think.

1650
02:27:14,157 --> 02:27:17,059
[SPEAKER_12]: But for me, I really wanted to just speak to the need.

1651
02:27:18,239 --> 02:27:20,200
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know about the parking.

1652
02:27:20,300 --> 02:27:22,061
[SPEAKER_12]: It sounds like it's a major issue.

1653
02:27:22,121 --> 02:27:24,382
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know the need is there.

1654
02:27:27,198 --> 02:27:32,899
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what I just really want to speak to the safety and just the programming aspect of it.

1655
02:27:33,879 --> 02:27:36,500
[SPEAKER_12]: So I mean, that's all I have.

1656
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:39,740
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just know I've been doing this a very long time.

1657
02:27:40,560 --> 02:27:43,041
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hate to say it and I say it with all due respect.

1658
02:27:43,621 --> 02:27:48,022
[SPEAKER_12]: We're in Boston and a lot of people from Method are coming to Boston to get services.

1659
02:27:48,562 --> 02:27:52,102
[SPEAKER_12]: So shame on us if we're not supporting those others as well.

1660
02:27:52,822 --> 02:27:54,023
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's dear to my heart.

1661
02:27:54,103 --> 02:27:55,963
[SPEAKER_12]: So I say that with respect.

1662
02:27:56,863 --> 02:28:04,382
[SPEAKER_12]: I say that with compassion and I pray that no one on this call have to ever experience going through a domestic violence and have nowhere to go.

1663
02:28:06,446 --> 02:28:07,867
[SPEAKER_40]: Well, Madam Chair, I'll pause there.

1664
02:28:07,907 --> 02:28:10,489
[SPEAKER_40]: I think we've given you the best we can.

1665
02:28:10,929 --> 02:28:12,049
[SPEAKER_40]: There was a mention about a gate.

1666
02:28:12,070 --> 02:28:14,151
[SPEAKER_40]: There's no gate that's swinging over anyone's property.

1667
02:28:14,211 --> 02:28:15,071
[SPEAKER_40]: That will not happen.

1668
02:28:15,752 --> 02:28:20,315
[SPEAKER_40]: Asbestos, anything like that, will have to be professionally handled if that's the case.

1669
02:28:21,715 --> 02:28:24,077
[SPEAKER_40]: Andrew Litchfield, Steve Suida, that's what they do.

1670
02:28:24,377 --> 02:28:26,038
[SPEAKER_40]: They're in the real estate industry.

1671
02:28:26,078 --> 02:28:28,800
[SPEAKER_40]: They deal with compromised buildings all the time.

1672
02:28:29,560 --> 02:28:30,541
[SPEAKER_40]: That's the work that they do.

1673
02:28:30,581 --> 02:28:31,982
[SPEAKER_40]: There's a process for handling that.

1674
02:28:33,139 --> 02:28:41,870
[SPEAKER_40]: and it'll be handled appropriately in concert with the Medford building departments and the appropriate public health agencies and what have you.

1675
02:28:43,091 --> 02:28:44,052
[SPEAKER_40]: I'll pause there, Madam Chair.

1676
02:28:45,414 --> 02:28:46,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Michael, Ruth and Taisha.

1677
02:28:47,016 --> 02:28:48,538
[SPEAKER_22]: Appreciate your responses.

1678
02:28:49,139 --> 02:28:50,981
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to hand it over to Director Hunt.

1679
02:28:54,942 --> 02:28:55,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1680
02:28:55,983 --> 02:28:59,664
[SPEAKER_10]: I just actually I wanted to share one other piece of information for the board.

1681
02:28:59,684 --> 02:29:03,746
[SPEAKER_10]: It's less something that one would consider as part of your deliberation.

1682
02:29:03,806 --> 02:29:05,727
[SPEAKER_10]: So truly, I wanted to share it for the public.

1683
02:29:06,848 --> 02:29:11,750
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the concerns that I anticipated hearing were concerns about the schools and transportation and costs.

1684
02:29:12,190 --> 02:29:17,414
[SPEAKER_10]: So I actually reached out to our director of registration and transportation.

1685
02:29:17,814 --> 02:29:21,076
[SPEAKER_10]: She also manages all homeless transportation for the school system.

1686
02:29:21,776 --> 02:29:24,638
[SPEAKER_10]: And she said that Medford desperately needs a shelter.

1687
02:29:24,778 --> 02:29:32,904
[SPEAKER_10]: She is aware of families that are couch surfing in Medford, and it would be in very overcrowded situations that they do not

1688
02:29:33,564 --> 02:29:37,487
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't have a legal obligation to report if the child is not in danger.

1689
02:29:38,568 --> 02:29:48,996
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are people who could really desperately benefit from having a little bit more space and not being doubled, tripled up in families like that.

1690
02:29:49,717 --> 02:29:52,279
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I asked her about how that would impact the schools.

1691
02:29:52,339 --> 02:29:59,585
[SPEAKER_10]: And she said if there were school age children and they were homeless, then the way it works is that a parent would decide

1692
02:30:00,025 --> 02:30:08,087
[SPEAKER_10]: whether they want the child to go to the school system for the school, for the community where they are currently living, or the one that they were displaced from.

1693
02:30:08,187 --> 02:30:15,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Say it was somebody who had been living in Everett and was displaced, then the parent could ask to have them placed in either Medford or Everett.

1694
02:30:15,728 --> 02:30:24,370
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if transportation, if they ended up in Medford, that would just be just a regular student who gets regular transportation like everybody else.

1695
02:30:25,010 --> 02:30:27,991
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it was that they needed to be transported back somewhere,

1696
02:30:29,167 --> 02:30:40,370
[SPEAKER_10]: And the way it is effectively working today is that both communities share the cost of transportation for those students, usually vans, and that the state is reimbursing 80% of the cost.

1697
02:30:41,050 --> 02:30:48,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, she named a law for me, Vento something, but basically we get reimbursed 80% of the cost of those transportation.

1698
02:30:48,231 --> 02:30:50,332
[SPEAKER_12]: I just put it in a text.

1699
02:30:51,560 --> 02:30:52,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, great, thank you.

1700
02:30:52,921 --> 02:30:55,023
[SPEAKER_10]: The McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act.

1701
02:30:55,844 --> 02:31:07,233
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just sort of thought that residents should have that information, even though it wouldn't be part of what the board would consider this evening, because I think there's a lot of misunderstanding or misinformation about that.

1702
02:31:08,274 --> 02:31:08,894
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Alicia.

1703
02:31:13,198 --> 02:31:16,100
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we've as a board of have a lot to think about.

1704
02:31:16,120 --> 02:31:20,424
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, I believe that halo house can be a good neighbor.

1705
02:31:20,444 --> 02:31:27,130
[SPEAKER_22]: And I believe that all members of the public on this call are and have the intent of also being good neighbors.

1706
02:31:27,630 --> 02:31:30,452
[SPEAKER_22]: But what I'm hearing is that there's a lot of variables out there.

1707
02:31:31,359 --> 02:31:41,345
[SPEAKER_22]: that need to be worked out, as well as some community outreach, you know, beyond soliciting for parking spaces, which it sounds like, you know, that was some of the primary activity.

1708
02:31:42,226 --> 02:31:53,452
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm leaning towards a continuous continuance of this discussion to allow more time, but I do also want to open it up to the board for deliberation.

1709
02:31:55,133 --> 02:32:01,615
[SPEAKER_22]: The two questions that we're deliberating are, does this qualify as protected educational use under the Dover Amendment?

1710
02:32:02,895 --> 02:32:07,417
[SPEAKER_22]: And following that, what are reasonable regulations that should apply to this project?

1711
02:32:07,957 --> 02:32:11,978
[SPEAKER_22]: Should the requested relief from parking requirements and other dimensional standards be granted?

1712
02:32:12,818 --> 02:32:17,640
[SPEAKER_22]: What conditions of approval are needed to mitigate any adverse impacts of waiving requirements?

1713
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:21,941
[SPEAKER_22]: So with that, I'm going to open it up to the board.

1714
02:32:23,381 --> 02:32:24,983
[SPEAKER_22]: for debate and deliberation.

1715
02:32:34,051 --> 02:32:37,554
[SPEAKER_22]: Annie, Ari, Adam, Peter.

1716
02:32:42,218 --> 02:32:48,643
[SPEAKER_15]: I am going to think out loud, which is perhaps dangerous, but

1717
02:32:50,337 --> 02:32:51,518
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we've got it.

1718
02:32:51,718 --> 02:32:57,144
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree with many of the things that Emily just summarized.

1719
02:32:57,164 --> 02:33:03,490
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think that there is a strong case for this being a benefit to our community.

1720
02:33:03,550 --> 02:33:09,617
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm also hearing very clearly that there are substantial concerns about the details of the implementation.

1721
02:33:10,938 --> 02:33:12,419
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that

1722
02:33:13,753 --> 02:33:25,942
[SPEAKER_15]: that's the role of a board like this is to create opportunity and to facilitate the collaboration of applicants and community to make something that's mutually beneficial for everyone.

1723
02:33:26,782 --> 02:33:33,647
[SPEAKER_15]: So a continuance to have that outreach to work through some of those details makes sense to me.

1724
02:33:33,667 --> 02:33:39,731
[SPEAKER_15]: I also have open but haven't been able to read because I was listening to this.

1725
02:33:40,292 --> 02:33:41,312
[SPEAKER_15]: As part of this discussion,

1726
02:33:42,967 --> 02:33:47,050
[SPEAKER_15]: kind of trying to do my own research on Dover Amendment.

1727
02:33:47,150 --> 02:33:51,092
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not a lawyer, but I'm a research librarian.

1728
02:33:51,112 --> 02:34:03,400
[SPEAKER_15]: And it seems like what we've been told so far is accurate, but I think one of the benefits of a continuance is that we can confirm that with additional research.

1729
02:34:05,887 --> 02:34:14,431
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't, I think, yeah, I don't want to give up on this project, but it's clearly a lot more discussion to be had on how to make it work.

1730
02:34:15,971 --> 02:34:16,531
[SPEAKER_29]: Thanks, Ari.

1731
02:34:17,352 --> 02:34:19,793
[SPEAKER_29]: I completely agree with Ari.

1732
02:34:20,493 --> 02:34:33,338
[SPEAKER_29]: I think that it's too important of a project not to have a continuance so we can discuss more fully some aspects of the project.

1733
02:34:36,203 --> 02:34:36,443
[SPEAKER_22]: Adam.

1734
02:34:37,624 --> 02:34:45,631
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I think I'd also just like to second those thoughts and maybe at the risk of also talking out loud a little bit.

1735
02:34:46,371 --> 02:34:49,394
[SPEAKER_24]: I think Michael Ross's point.

1736
02:34:50,833 --> 02:35:01,905
[SPEAKER_24]: of, you know, the purpose of an amendment like the Dover Amendment is because, you know, things like this belong in communities and there's often pushback from that.

1737
02:35:03,607 --> 02:35:07,431
[SPEAKER_24]: But I also think, you know, there's legitimate kind of concerns from the community.

1738
02:35:08,487 --> 02:35:13,791
[SPEAKER_24]: that outreach in time would build a better sense of trust between them.

1739
02:35:14,511 --> 02:35:24,718
[SPEAKER_24]: And without being a lawyer, and I think it's valid for us to do our diligence to make sure, yep, this does fall within Dover given the previous case law.

1740
02:35:25,879 --> 02:35:40,649
[SPEAKER_24]: my own kind of research on it and just looking at previous sort of cases and educational shelters, it seems likely that this falls under the purview of the Dover Amendment.

1741
02:35:42,170 --> 02:35:49,955
[SPEAKER_24]: But a continuance makes sense to not make something, especially, as folks have told, I think a lot of people are exasperated after the last day.

1742
02:35:51,596 --> 02:35:54,338
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't want to make a decision where we're tired

1743
02:35:55,942 --> 02:35:59,565
[SPEAKER_24]: We're sort of in whatever mood we're in.

1744
02:36:01,667 --> 02:36:17,700
[SPEAKER_24]: And then I think the other part is just kind of from the community outreach and trust, I've experienced just in different cities living next to these types of projects or facilities.

1745
02:36:18,868 --> 02:36:23,770
[SPEAKER_24]: I've never had anything but a very positive experience of them.

1746
02:36:25,770 --> 02:36:28,471
[SPEAKER_24]: I think they serve a very valuable role.

1747
02:36:28,591 --> 02:36:41,115
[SPEAKER_24]: And I think like the folks presenting, so I said, these are members of our community that oftentimes fall into a time of need.

1748
02:36:43,665 --> 02:37:00,779
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, and then the last point you know I think I don't personally feel prepared right now as a member of the board to, to really speak through all the tactical questions of, of the parking, and, you know, kind of the impact assessment and what exceptions would would would really be.

1749
02:37:03,600 --> 02:37:04,640
[SPEAKER_24]: like made there.

1750
02:37:04,840 --> 02:37:22,806
[SPEAKER_24]: And the thing I would sort of find helpful would just be a little bit kind of more concrete examples of similar projects like this, you know, just a little bit, just more concrete, like, like data points to the amount of traffic to expect.

1751
02:37:24,667 --> 02:37:27,488
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, from the effort, I think of like the mutual trust.

1752
02:37:34,315 --> 02:37:37,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Looks like Peter is also on the line.

1753
02:37:38,056 --> 02:37:40,717
[SPEAKER_22]: He is iPhone.

1754
02:37:40,737 --> 02:37:45,938
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to try to find him and ask to unmute.

1755
02:37:49,519 --> 02:37:50,079
[SPEAKER_22]: I see iPhone 5.

1756
02:37:50,239 --> 02:37:57,201
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll get the attendee list.

1757
02:37:58,641 --> 02:38:01,102
[SPEAKER_10]: There's an iPhone and an iPhone 5 guest.

1758
02:38:02,187 --> 02:38:02,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair?

1759
02:38:02,687 --> 02:38:04,268
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's just iPhone.

1760
02:38:05,188 --> 02:38:06,268
[SPEAKER_10]: I can ask him to unmute.

1761
02:38:06,849 --> 02:38:07,109
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1762
02:38:08,469 --> 02:38:09,850
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're, yeah.

1763
02:38:13,271 --> 02:38:16,892
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're dialed in, you would need to, is that Peter Calves?

1764
02:38:18,033 --> 02:38:19,033
[SPEAKER_25]: Yep, yep, that's me.

1765
02:38:19,953 --> 02:38:21,074
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1766
02:38:21,094 --> 02:38:23,975
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, sorry about that, had to change devices.

1767
02:38:25,135 --> 02:38:30,617
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I think I do get

1768
02:38:32,358 --> 02:38:34,659
[SPEAKER_25]: a lot of the concern.

1769
02:38:37,861 --> 02:38:55,309
[SPEAKER_25]: And I do think there are, especially with the dimensional aspects, some real parsing that needs to be done to make sure that we understand what we're voting on and hopefully what we're approving.

1770
02:38:57,430 --> 02:39:01,472
[SPEAKER_25]: So I would... Well, I do think that

1771
02:39:02,339 --> 02:39:07,844
[SPEAKER_25]: at least my questions that I had earlier in the night about debt over applicability have been answered.

1772
02:39:07,864 --> 02:39:15,190
[SPEAKER_25]: I do think given other members concerned that anything that continues would be valid at this time.

1773
02:39:15,210 --> 02:39:19,554
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

1774
02:39:28,701 --> 02:39:28,982
[SPEAKER_21]: So,

1775
02:39:31,171 --> 02:39:39,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Madam Chair, would it be appropriate for one of the members of the board to call a vote or to motion to vote for a continuance?

1776
02:39:39,416 --> 02:39:41,958
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we need to specify a date first.

1777
02:39:42,745 --> 02:39:42,985
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1778
02:39:43,586 --> 02:39:46,950
[SPEAKER_10]: Just so you're clear, you must continue to a date and time certain.

1779
02:39:47,390 --> 02:39:51,154
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd recommend negotiating that with the applicants so that everybody can be present.

1780
02:39:52,195 --> 02:40:00,985
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that it would be helpful if we could list a few of the things that we would want to have happen between now and then.

1781
02:40:04,700 --> 02:40:04,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1782
02:40:04,940 --> 02:40:09,782
[SPEAKER_10]: And I do want to say that our traffic comments were predicated on being a private way.

1783
02:40:09,802 --> 02:40:18,486
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would I do think that we need to figure out how to reconcile the state information that Peter had.

1784
02:40:19,167 --> 02:40:25,650
[SPEAKER_10]: We would welcome you to communicate with us offline with the local information that our traffic and engineering department had.

1785
02:40:26,070 --> 02:40:32,934
[SPEAKER_10]: because it really does make a difference into what we can and should ask of them if this is a public or a private way.

1786
02:40:33,454 --> 02:40:38,537
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm very sorry that we couldn't, didn't manage to have that reconciled for this evening.

1787
02:40:39,797 --> 02:40:47,341
[SPEAKER_22]: So maybe we can summarize the information that we'd like for the continuance so the applicant can understand the scope.

1788
02:40:49,623 --> 02:40:50,723
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we can discuss dates.

1789
02:40:51,644 --> 02:40:53,705
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think we're still in board deliberations.

1790
02:40:58,139 --> 02:41:03,322
[SPEAKER_22]: Should we bring up a Word document to start drafting topics, Danielle?

1791
02:41:07,145 --> 02:41:08,285
[SPEAKER_14]: I've lost my train of thought.

1792
02:41:08,325 --> 02:41:09,386
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm really tired.

1793
02:41:14,229 --> 02:41:23,135
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to say that whatever meeting it's continued to, if we're looking for a sidewalk solution, I would like

1794
02:41:23,672 --> 02:41:34,114
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, finalize plans because it's difficult to put conditions on things that need to appear on plans because then it's open for interpretation and becomes hard to enforce.

1795
02:41:34,914 --> 02:41:42,436
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will add that the next meeting is going to be a very busy one.

1796
02:41:43,536 --> 02:41:49,777
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the tough storm site plan review and also the Mystic Avenue core district zoning amendment.

1797
02:41:51,718 --> 02:41:52,778
[SPEAKER_22]: What's the date of that meeting?

1798
02:41:53,841 --> 02:42:00,228
[SPEAKER_14]: That's the 20th, just the next meeting.

1799
02:42:00,788 --> 02:42:03,991
[SPEAKER_22]: And what's the date of the following meeting, December 4.

1800
02:42:04,952 --> 02:42:05,253
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1801
02:42:08,436 --> 02:42:10,218
[SPEAKER_29]: I think December 4 sounds.

1802
02:42:11,722 --> 02:42:15,005
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to have the applicant confirm their availability.

1803
02:42:15,145 --> 02:42:24,473
[SPEAKER_22]: And I also think it would be good to kind of capture the scope of information we'd like at that next meeting, just so they understand, you know, is it a mountain?

1804
02:42:24,513 --> 02:42:25,334
[SPEAKER_22]: Is it a molehill?

1805
02:42:25,454 --> 02:42:26,455
[SPEAKER_22]: How much time do they need?

1806
02:42:28,215 --> 02:42:34,820
[SPEAKER_40]: So our group would be happy to come to the December 4th meeting as a date certain.

1807
02:42:35,080 --> 02:42:44,428
[SPEAKER_40]: And what we would like to do is get with staff between now and then and work through the list that we could generate.

1808
02:42:45,249 --> 02:42:52,895
[SPEAKER_40]: And I would prefer to approach the board collectively with staff to have provided

1809
02:42:54,068 --> 02:43:00,212
[SPEAKER_40]: kind of the work product that we've come up with as a result of the comments that were brought here today.

1810
02:43:00,932 --> 02:43:03,434
[SPEAKER_40]: I think that there are legitimate comments that were raised.

1811
02:43:03,734 --> 02:43:06,976
[SPEAKER_40]: I think there were also some non-legitimate comments that were raised.

1812
02:43:07,096 --> 02:43:08,817
[SPEAKER_40]: And I think we have to be honest about that.

1813
02:43:09,998 --> 02:43:16,882
[SPEAKER_40]: And so I want to make sure that what we're being asked to do is in keeping with our rights as an applicant with this particular use.

1814
02:43:20,916 --> 02:43:23,078
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, we do have a clear mandate for this board.

1815
02:43:23,559 --> 02:43:27,083
[SPEAKER_22]: There are certain items that are under our jurisdiction and other items that are not.

1816
02:43:27,944 --> 02:43:31,467
[SPEAKER_22]: So it is good to remain within those boundaries.

1817
02:43:32,689 --> 02:43:33,930
[SPEAKER_22]: That is your right as an applicant.

1818
02:43:34,290 --> 02:43:41,718
[SPEAKER_22]: So we will do that duty as a board to you as an applicant and also to the citizens of Medford.

1819
02:43:45,006 --> 02:43:45,747
[SPEAKER_22]: as a planning board.

1820
02:43:46,467 --> 02:43:48,488
[SPEAKER_22]: And I just got a question.

1821
02:43:48,528 --> 02:43:50,330
[SPEAKER_22]: Can we send more questions via email?

1822
02:43:50,410 --> 02:43:53,091
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, please send any questions, any comments.

1823
02:43:53,752 --> 02:44:01,197
[SPEAKER_22]: We welcome and encourage them and thankful to everybody for staying on the line, providing their insight for this project.

1824
02:44:04,659 --> 02:44:05,340
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Alicia.

1825
02:44:07,841 --> 02:44:10,683
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, Peter, go on.

1826
02:44:11,124 --> 02:44:13,105
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, so just doing my third

1827
02:44:14,062 --> 02:44:16,324
[SPEAKER_25]: duties here on this.

1828
02:44:17,845 --> 02:44:19,086
[SPEAKER_25]: I've got a list of conditions.

1829
02:44:19,106 --> 02:44:27,512
[SPEAKER_25]: Danielle said something about finalizing the design plan and what we wanted to confirm the jurisdiction of St.

1830
02:44:27,552 --> 02:44:32,636
[SPEAKER_25]: Clair Street and what the transportation implications of that might be.

1831
02:44:43,325 --> 02:44:50,310
[SPEAKER_25]: And is there anything else that members of the board would like to see as condition for the continuing two days?

1832
02:44:53,753 --> 02:45:07,564
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, our regulations can be related to parking requirements, other dimensional standards, and then any conditions of approval that are needed to mitigate any adverse impacts of waiving requirements.

1833
02:45:08,439 --> 02:45:11,521
[SPEAKER_22]: So that captures a good amount of them.

1834
02:45:11,541 --> 02:45:23,869
[SPEAKER_22]: I would also encourage the applicant to address maybe some things that are outside the scope of this board, especially if there are photos or maps or other

1835
02:45:25,990 --> 02:45:34,493
[SPEAKER_22]: other pieces of information that will help the public understand some of your responses to these questions.

1836
02:45:35,153 --> 02:45:44,436
[SPEAKER_22]: I think that would be very beneficial for any future neighborhood relationships as appropriate.

1837
02:45:46,137 --> 02:45:49,318
[SPEAKER_22]: I did get a question through the chat, and this is something that

1838
02:45:50,826 --> 02:45:59,634
[SPEAKER_22]: I might need to float up to the city or it might be under the board's purview if the December 4th meeting is intended for the community and residents as well.

1839
02:46:00,455 --> 02:46:08,882
[SPEAKER_22]: The meetings are always open to community and residents, but I'm understanding that maybe there's an additional comment desire for that.

1840
02:46:10,264 --> 02:46:11,004
[SPEAKER_22]: Was that the question?

1841
02:46:11,024 --> 02:46:11,885
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, okay.

1842
02:46:12,206 --> 02:46:14,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Could we have another public comment period?

1843
02:46:15,735 --> 02:46:30,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair, what is often done with particularly topics that are either long, big, or controversial is that you might say that you'd like to restrict the public comments to items that were not addressed at this meeting.

1844
02:46:30,548 --> 02:46:38,995
[SPEAKER_10]: So if they present new information and new things, then the public could comment on that, but that there would be no

1845
02:46:41,016 --> 02:47:07,015
[SPEAKER_10]: A reason for the board to hear the same comments that were already spoken this evening That they should restrict their comments to new information that becomes available I think that you could also contain that with if people feel that they didn't get to speak tonight But it's just they want to echo what's been here Please send us an email and then the board would have that that there are more people who feel the same way

1846
02:47:07,695 --> 02:47:12,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but not that we would listen to 10 people say the same thing over and over.

1847
02:47:12,739 --> 02:47:21,185
[SPEAKER_22]: And just to clarify, you know, it was very helpful to hear the repetition of sentiments from the public this evening.

1848
02:47:21,245 --> 02:47:33,313
[SPEAKER_22]: So we really appreciate people coming on the line and, you know, sharing their their feedback and their expertise and their experience, along with the applicant sharing, you know, their, their vision for the site.

1849
02:47:33,333 --> 02:47:34,534
[SPEAKER_22]: So if

1850
02:47:38,498 --> 02:47:40,281
[SPEAKER_21]: One is, yeah.

1851
02:47:40,842 --> 02:47:41,864
[SPEAKER_24]: One other question.

1852
02:47:42,465 --> 02:47:49,798
[SPEAKER_24]: We had the, we had the Dover amendment was the government was included I think and what Peter said.

1853
02:47:53,438 --> 02:47:57,200
[SPEAKER_24]: I think there was a comment from the public, which was also a valid comment.

1854
02:47:58,200 --> 02:48:18,371
[SPEAKER_24]: It's nice to get the lawyer's opinion, but I think as a council member, it would be nice to see the case law examples or the document itself, just independently triangulate so we as a board also concur with the lawyer opinion.

1855
02:48:19,908 --> 02:48:47,965
[SPEAKER_39]: uh just so we are also documents i mean i'm sorry to interrupt out of turn here ma'am chair through you but um the uh you know the the petition that we have a 24 page um you know granted some of that as an exhibit uh letter that we provided to the board that got into i must have missed the exhibit i'm sorry uh but maybe make a note um

1856
02:48:48,928 --> 02:48:57,314
[SPEAKER_24]: that for the December 4th meeting, the board should explicitly go through the reference exhibit.

1857
02:48:58,696 --> 02:49:00,037
[SPEAKER_24]: And my apologies, Michael.

1858
02:49:00,057 --> 02:49:02,599
[SPEAKER_24]: I did not see the specific exhibit.

1859
02:49:03,399 --> 02:49:06,441
[SPEAKER_40]: There's that Boston O'Neill report as well, nine pages.

1860
02:49:06,962 --> 02:49:11,465
[SPEAKER_40]: It's not just one little blip, as someone commented.

1861
02:49:12,046 --> 02:49:14,588
[SPEAKER_40]: So there's a pretty good deck of materials.

1862
02:49:14,608 --> 02:49:16,689
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1863
02:49:19,780 --> 02:49:25,043
[SPEAKER_22]: I just see another comment about how much time will the community have to review material.

1864
02:49:25,063 --> 02:49:36,749
[SPEAKER_22]: We abide by open meeting law regulations, so I believe all meeting notices are posted at 48 hours in advance of meetings.

1865
02:49:38,069 --> 02:49:42,431
[SPEAKER_22]: And then we've shared a couple times the link to

1866
02:49:46,709 --> 02:49:47,689
[SPEAKER_22]: Let me see if I can pull it.

1867
02:49:48,389 --> 02:49:53,650
[SPEAKER_22]: The link to the applicant's information as submitted.

1868
02:49:53,670 --> 02:49:55,411
[SPEAKER_22]: So I can put that back in.

1869
02:49:55,471 --> 02:49:57,831
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, I don't have it because I left and came back.

1870
02:49:58,472 --> 02:50:00,172
[SPEAKER_22]: Alicia, could you drop that link in again?

1871
02:50:03,573 --> 02:50:03,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1872
02:50:05,873 --> 02:50:07,754
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Chair, two items.

1873
02:50:08,514 --> 02:50:14,015
[SPEAKER_10]: One, if the board wants, I can request a formal written opinion from our lawyer.

1874
02:50:15,098 --> 02:50:19,403
[SPEAKER_10]: on the matters of this case, on it being a Dover.

1875
02:50:21,486 --> 02:50:34,460
[SPEAKER_10]: And the other is that the owners of the property, Andrew Litchfield and Steve Suda, would like to share their contact information with the public, since while they knock on doors, they said a lot of people don't answer.

1876
02:50:35,461 --> 02:50:38,003
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm going to drop that in the chat for here.

1877
02:50:38,444 --> 02:50:52,674
[SPEAKER_10]: But actually, if they're amenable, then I will put we can put that into a small Word document in with the public files, contact information for the owners, if they would like us to do it that way as well for people to reach them.

1878
02:50:53,875 --> 02:51:00,658
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and I'm the applicant for putting that information out there and being willing to hear directly from the public.

1879
02:51:00,698 --> 02:51:07,981
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'd encourage you to share any feedback or any progress with city staff as well as the board.

1880
02:51:08,001 --> 02:51:14,584
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, cool.

1881
02:51:14,604 --> 02:51:19,026
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you, Alicia, for dropping that in.

1882
02:51:19,832 --> 02:51:20,653
[SPEAKER_22]: I did get another question.

1883
02:51:20,713 --> 02:51:21,994
[SPEAKER_22]: Is the next meeting December 4th?

1884
02:51:23,895 --> 02:51:26,598
[SPEAKER_22]: That is the date that we're proposing to continue to.

1885
02:51:27,038 --> 02:51:28,139
[SPEAKER_22]: We have to do a formal motion.

1886
02:51:28,199 --> 02:51:32,342
[SPEAKER_22]: It sounds like the applicant is supportive of that date.

1887
02:51:33,243 --> 02:51:33,963
[SPEAKER_22]: Seeing some nods.

1888
02:51:35,925 --> 02:51:38,287
[SPEAKER_22]: Annie, did you have a comment or?

1889
02:51:38,307 --> 02:51:41,169
[SPEAKER_29]: No, I would be happy to make the motion.

1890
02:51:41,770 --> 02:51:41,950
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1891
02:51:44,138 --> 02:51:52,665
[SPEAKER_29]: I would like to make a motion that on December 4th, we continue the discussion on this very important topic.

1892
02:51:54,206 --> 02:51:55,387
[SPEAKER_22]: And do we have a second?

1893
02:51:55,407 --> 02:51:57,929
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll second.

1894
02:51:58,850 --> 02:51:59,410
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Peter.

1895
02:52:00,571 --> 02:52:05,255
[SPEAKER_22]: So the motion in front of us is to continue the document.

1896
02:52:13,204 --> 02:52:15,365
[SPEAKER_29]: Discussions on the Hollow House?

1897
02:52:17,045 --> 02:52:19,686
[SPEAKER_22]: To continue the discussion on 21 St.

1898
02:52:19,726 --> 02:52:25,908
[SPEAKER_22]: Clair Road, a site plan review for a Dover amendment use to December 4th without prejudice.

1899
02:52:26,628 --> 02:52:28,328
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

1900
02:52:34,190 --> 02:52:34,990
[SPEAKER_22]: Jackie McPherson?

1901
02:52:38,431 --> 02:52:39,091
[SPEAKER_22]: Peter Calves?

1902
02:52:41,132 --> 02:52:41,212
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

1903
02:52:43,203 --> 02:52:43,804
[SPEAKER_22]: Ari Fishman.

1904
02:52:44,785 --> 02:52:44,905
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

1905
02:52:46,447 --> 02:52:47,308
[SPEAKER_22]: Sabrina Alpino.

1906
02:52:50,732 --> 02:52:51,372
[SPEAKER_22]: Adam Behrens.

1907
02:52:53,074 --> 02:52:53,174
[SPEAKER_25]: Aye.

1908
02:52:54,256 --> 02:52:54,836
[SPEAKER_22]: Annie Strang.

1909
02:52:56,638 --> 02:52:56,798
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

1910
02:52:58,260 --> 02:52:58,841
[SPEAKER_22]: Ben LaValle.

1911
02:52:58,861 --> 02:52:58,921
[SPEAKER_22]: Aye.

1912
02:53:00,862 --> 02:53:03,804
[SPEAKER_22]: And myself, Emily Hedeman, is an I for continuing.

1913
02:53:04,604 --> 02:53:07,366
[SPEAKER_22]: I do see some more comments coming through the chat.

1914
02:53:07,646 --> 02:53:16,511
[SPEAKER_22]: I would encourage the public to send those comments to the OCD website or share it with the applicant directly.

1915
02:53:17,031 --> 02:53:18,712
[SPEAKER_22]: They have made that very generous offer.

1916
02:53:18,952 --> 02:53:24,275
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would encourage members of the public to pursue those two methods.

1917
02:53:29,103 --> 02:53:31,125
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry, Emily, just one clarifying.

1918
02:53:31,185 --> 02:53:49,959
[SPEAKER_24]: In the Google Drive shared by Alicia, I think that was the Google Drive that I looked at and I had trouble finding the Dover Amendment document that Michael was talking about.

1919
02:53:51,380 --> 02:53:56,304
[SPEAKER_22]: Why don't we maybe work through that content?

1920
02:53:58,075 --> 02:54:02,416
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, I just wanted to call out because it seemed like that was a thing the public was also interested in.

1921
02:54:02,436 --> 02:54:03,296
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1922
02:54:04,096 --> 02:54:04,276
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1923
02:54:05,717 --> 02:54:07,377
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that'll be a good thing to clarify.

1924
02:54:07,397 --> 02:54:09,317
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you for bringing that up.

1925
02:54:12,078 --> 02:54:18,179
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so with that, we will see the applicant for 21 St Clair on December 4.

1926
02:54:21,286 --> 02:54:24,628
[SPEAKER_22]: We thank all members of the public for participating in the public hearing.

1927
02:54:24,648 --> 02:54:25,948
[SPEAKER_22]: It means a lot.

1928
02:54:26,008 --> 02:54:27,529
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a great way to be locally involved.

1929
02:54:27,569 --> 02:54:28,149
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

1930
02:54:28,989 --> 02:54:32,791
[SPEAKER_22]: And we will move on to our next agenda item, which is approval of minutes.

1931
02:54:34,032 --> 02:54:35,992
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's just stick around for that fascinating discussion.

1932
02:54:36,012 --> 02:54:37,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, everyone.

1933
02:54:38,714 --> 02:54:39,174
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1934
02:54:41,715 --> 02:54:46,957
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'd like to ask if any board members have any comments or suggested edits for the October 9th, 2024 draft minutes.

1935
02:54:52,148 --> 02:54:52,668
[SPEAKER_29]: I do not.

1936
02:54:52,688 --> 02:54:56,249
[SPEAKER_32]: I don't.

1937
02:54:57,549 --> 02:54:58,489
[SPEAKER_15]: I move to accept them.

1938
02:54:58,509 --> 02:55:00,089
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we have a second?

1939
02:55:01,550 --> 02:55:02,150
[SPEAKER_29]: I second.

1940
02:55:03,190 --> 02:55:03,590
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1941
02:55:04,350 --> 02:55:10,891
[SPEAKER_22]: So the motion in front of us is to approve the board minutes for the October 9, 2024 meeting.

1942
02:55:10,951 --> 02:55:13,232
[SPEAKER_22]: We're going to do a roll call vote.

1943
02:55:14,472 --> 02:55:16,192
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm just going to do it as I see people on screen.

1944
02:55:17,512 --> 02:55:18,112
[SPEAKER_22]: Annie Strang.

1945
02:55:19,313 --> 02:55:19,833

1948
02:55:52,288 --> 02:55:53,930
[SPEAKER_22]: Approaching the 10 o'clock hour.

1949
02:55:53,950 --> 02:55:56,073
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm almost too tired to do that.

1950
02:55:56,353 --> 02:55:58,316
[SPEAKER_10]: November 20 is a public hearing.

1951
02:55:59,017 --> 02:56:03,442
[SPEAKER_10]: If you want to review any of that with me in advance, I'm happy to do that.

1952
02:56:04,263 --> 02:56:12,366
[SPEAKER_10]: We do anticipate trying to move forward with Salem Street pretty quickly in December as well.

1953
02:56:12,707 --> 02:56:14,887
[SPEAKER_10]: So, but I think that's none of that is new for you.

1954
02:56:15,908 --> 02:56:21,270
[SPEAKER_10]: You will see that it includes just a line that you have to have a green score.

1955
02:56:21,790 --> 02:56:25,272
[SPEAKER_10]: We are still working through the details of green score with the consultant.

1956
02:56:25,752 --> 02:56:32,755
[SPEAKER_10]: So that is actually gonna have to come kind of after the fact, but it'll come quickly in December too.

1957
02:56:34,675 --> 02:56:36,796
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's just Mystic Avenue, Alicia?

1958
02:56:37,996 --> 02:56:40,577
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a complete rezoning of Mystic Ave.

1959
02:56:41,117 --> 02:56:45,319
[SPEAKER_10]: It also includes definitions that we've never used in our zoning before.

1960
02:56:45,339 --> 02:57:00,965
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want me to drop a link to- In the CD board file, you can find the language for the new Mystic Avenue corridor district along with the map.

1961
02:57:02,230 --> 02:57:04,491
[SPEAKER_14]: and the public hearing notes.

1962
02:57:04,951 --> 02:57:13,494
[SPEAKER_10]: So Adam, not the Google Drive that I was sharing to the public, but the one that would be in Danielle's emails too.

1963
02:57:13,774 --> 02:57:16,135
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, got it.

1964
02:57:16,535 --> 02:57:23,497
[SPEAKER_29]: That's where I've been going, what Danielle sends and those files that she...

1965
02:57:25,236 --> 02:57:37,370
[SPEAKER_14]: There's public facing files and then there's things that I provide to the board, like draft conditions, staff memos, things that are not the application materials.

1966
02:57:37,450 --> 02:57:42,036
[SPEAKER_14]: So to prepare for a meeting, definitely look at the folder that I send out.

1967
02:57:45,054 --> 02:57:51,255
[SPEAKER_24]: but the, so I haven't created.

1968
02:57:51,275 --> 02:57:54,296
[SPEAKER_14]: So I haven't created a folder for the next meeting yet.

1969
02:57:54,336 --> 02:58:04,618
[SPEAKER_14]: So it will be the public one in the city board filings because the public notice ran today and therefore all of that had to be revealed.

1970
02:58:06,139 --> 02:58:06,419
[SPEAKER_22]: Great.

1971
02:58:10,660 --> 02:58:11,560
[SPEAKER_22]: Any other business?

1972
02:58:13,556 --> 02:58:14,977
[SPEAKER_22]: I did get one other question.

1973
02:58:15,897 --> 02:58:19,699
[SPEAKER_22]: When the recording will be posted, do we post these recordings?

1974
02:58:24,581 --> 02:58:26,062
[SPEAKER_10]: This was live on TV.

1975
02:58:26,082 --> 02:58:26,122
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1976
02:58:28,063 --> 02:58:33,766
[SPEAKER_10]: So it just takes a short while for it to get rendered, and then it's up on the MCM site.

1977
02:58:33,786 --> 02:58:34,666
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

1978
02:58:37,908 --> 02:58:39,368
[SPEAKER_22]: And that's Medford Community Media.

1979
02:58:40,269 --> 02:58:42,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's MedfordTV.org.

1980
02:58:42,790 --> 02:58:42,890
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1981
02:58:44,248 --> 02:58:45,328
[SPEAKER_22]: Great, thank you, Alicia.

1982
02:58:46,909 --> 02:58:50,289
[SPEAKER_22]: So if there's no other business, do we have a call for adjournment?

1983
02:58:51,390 --> 02:58:52,370
[SPEAKER_22]: I move to adjourn.

1984
02:58:52,390 --> 02:58:54,070
[SPEAKER_22]: I second.

1985
02:58:54,670 --> 02:58:55,111
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1986
02:58:55,951 --> 02:58:57,891
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to do as I see you all on screen.

1987
02:58:59,932 --> 02:59:04,213
[SPEAKER_22]: So the motion before us is to adjourn our November 6th meeting.

1988
02:59:05,733 --> 02:59:06,733
