1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:02,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'd be there two hours early.

2
00:00:55,275 --> 00:00:59,618
[SPEAKER_05]: And welcome to the Medford Democratic City Committee School Committee Candidates Forum.

3
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:05,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight's program is being broadcast, streamed and recorded for later playback by the Medford Community Media.

4
00:01:06,183 --> 00:01:12,087
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Bruce Kulik and along with Phyllis Morrison, who is absent tonight, we are the co-chairs of the committee.

5
00:01:13,108 --> 00:01:17,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight we will hear statements of responses to questions from all nine school committee candidates.

6
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:22,774
[SPEAKER_05]: The general election will be held November the 4th with early voting beginning October 25th.

7
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,452
[SPEAKER_05]: The moderators will be myself and Anita Tucker, who is a member of the committee.

8
00:01:30,893 --> 00:01:39,116
[SPEAKER_05]: We are joined by volunteers from Jumbo Vote, a non-partisan student-run organization from the Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University.

9
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:50,700
[SPEAKER_05]: Tufts students' volunteers tonight include our timekeepers, Tegan Mastone, Dombian Kurt,

10
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:57,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Eleanor Shockney-Martello, Jules Zinn-Rothorn.

11
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:05,396
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have a volunteer from the Medford High, Jacob Yee, who is up in the booth operating the lights and providing technical assistance.

12
00:02:06,717 --> 00:02:13,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Brianna Lungel has graciously declined to participate tonight to allow the focus to remain on the school committee candidates.

13
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:24,873
[SPEAKER_05]: The format of tonight's forum will consist of opening statements by each candidate, followed by questions and responses by each candidate, and concluded with a closing statement.

14
00:02:25,634 --> 00:02:34,797
[SPEAKER_05]: The order of speaking was determined by random selection conducted earlier by members of the organizing committee, with candidates allowed to swap positions by mutual agreement.

15
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:41,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Candidate Ntapa has notified us he has additional personal engagement this evening and will need to leave early.

16
00:02:42,168 --> 00:02:45,470
[SPEAKER_05]: He has designated Lacey Ntapa to deliver his closing statement.

17
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:52,776
[SPEAKER_05]: Each candidate will be allowed two minutes for the opening and closing statements as well as two minutes response time for each question.

18
00:02:53,656 --> 00:03:00,301
[SPEAKER_05]: The timekeeper will display a yellow card when 15 seconds remain and a red card when time has expired.

19
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:03,724
[SPEAKER_05]: The moderator will then tell the candidate that time is up.

20
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,586
[SPEAKER_03]: We will now introduce each candidate.

21
00:03:14,586 --> 00:03:20,771
[SPEAKER_03]: When your name is called, please stand, if able, and greet the audience, and then return to your seat.

22
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:29,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Mastrobrioni, Jessica Parks, Nicole, oh, sorry, hang on.

23
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:33,059
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my fault, because I want to read down instead of across.

24
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,181
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start again.

25
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:39,404
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Mastrobrioni, Aaron Olapod,

26
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Jenny Graham, Erika Renfield, I'm doing it again.

27
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:45,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't stand this.

28
00:03:45,663 --> 00:03:58,953
[SPEAKER_03]: John and Topper, Jessica Parks, Jenny Graham, Lisa Kingsley, Nicole Branley, Erika Renfield, and Paul Rousseau.

29
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:12,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Each candidate will now have two minutes each to deliver their opening statement.

30
00:04:15,751 --> 00:04:16,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael?

31
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:22,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Can everybody hear me?

32
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:23,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

33
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:24,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks so much.

34
00:04:25,559 --> 00:04:26,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening and thank you for having me.

35
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:28,422
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Michael Mastrobone.

36
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,624
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a parent of two MPS kids.

37
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,627
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a public servant and obviously I'm running for school committee.

38
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:39,740
[SPEAKER_08]: My family moved to Medford because it reflects the values that we try to live by.

39
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:47,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Strong public school system, a community that believes in showing up for one another, and an active civic spirit that you can feel at block parties and PTO meetings.

40
00:04:48,201 --> 00:04:50,962
[SPEAKER_08]: And of course, we also moved here for the Fells.

41
00:04:51,702 --> 00:04:57,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Since moving here, Medford has welcomed my wife and me along with our seven-year-old Lincoln and our four-year-old Violet, both Roberts kids.

42
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:02,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Running for school committee is my way of giving back to the community that's given us so, so much.

43
00:05:03,384 --> 00:05:10,211
[SPEAKER_08]: In my professional life, I serve as budget director for the City of Somerville, where I manage large, complex budgets and long-term capital planning.

44
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:19,701
[SPEAKER_08]: My job is to make sure public dollars serve the public, protecting core services, aligning spending with community priorities, and keeping programs strong no matter what comes our way.

45
00:05:19,821 --> 00:05:21,843
[SPEAKER_08]: That includes the federal government and the state government.

46
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:26,139
[SPEAKER_08]: That experience that I have in my everyday life matters here.

47
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:32,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I was part of the finance team that delivered Somerville's new high school project in 2021 from early planning through construction.

48
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:32,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really proud of that.

49
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,502
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what it takes to support a school building project that meets student needs while staying fiscally responsible.

50
00:05:40,202 --> 00:05:46,844
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know how important transparency and communication are when you're spending public dollars on something that's gonna shape a community for generations.

51
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:52,485
[SPEAKER_08]: I've spent my career protecting local resources, planning for the longterm, and keeping vital programs strong.

52
00:05:53,582 --> 00:05:56,348
[SPEAKER_08]: The school committee, it's not just a policy group, it's an executive body.

53
00:05:56,608 --> 00:06:04,104
[SPEAKER_08]: It hires and evaluates the superintendent, it ensures the district budget reflects our values, and it sets measurable goals and holds us accountable for meeting them.

54
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:11,264
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm ready to do that work on day one by bringing my expertise, my leadership, and my ability to turn resources into results.

55
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:13,725
[SPEAKER_08]: If I'm elected, I'll focus on three things.

56
00:06:13,945 --> 00:06:20,408
[SPEAKER_08]: First, championing our public schools by supporting curriculum and making sure every student has a place to thrive.

57
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:28,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Second, budgeting for values and stability through transparent multi-year budgeting that protects what works and invests in areas where we need improvement.

58
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:30,853
[SPEAKER_08]: And third, delivering a successful Medford High School project.

59
00:06:31,514 --> 00:06:32,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Such a joy and I'm ready to get to work.

60
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:34,355
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd be honored to earn your support, thank you.

61
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:41,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello, and thank you so much for having me.

62
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:44,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to say thank you to the Medford Democratic Committee.

63
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:47,639
[SPEAKER_09]: the Medford Public Schools for welcoming us, and my fellow candidates for being on stage with me.

64
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:54,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a product of Medford Schools, not just as a graduate, but as a school committee member and leader seeking re-election.

65
00:06:55,224 --> 00:07:03,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen firsthand both the challenges and opportunities facing our schools, and I reign steadfast in the belief every child deserves an education that unlocks their full potential.

66
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:11,275
[SPEAKER_09]: At a time when public education is under attack, when diversity of every kind is at the highest it's ever been in our classrooms,

67
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:19,288
[SPEAKER_09]: And when budget debates threaten the resources our students depend on, we need steady leadership and voices with lived experience on the committee.

68
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:29,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford shaped me, and now, as your school committee member, I work to shape a brighter future for every student, on every path, from classrooms to careers.

69
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:45,039
[SPEAKER_09]: From advocating and securing historic funding through the 2024 overrides, to advancing equity initiatives and capital planning for a new high school as a voting member of your building committee, I'm already fighting to make sure our schools are safe, welcoming, and prepared for the future, but the work is not done just yet.

70
00:07:46,105 --> 00:07:50,868
[SPEAKER_09]: During university, I studied political science, not just to understand systems, but to change them.

71
00:07:51,849 --> 00:08:05,039
[SPEAKER_09]: My senior research on behavior in the classroom, the adverse effects of implicit bias, and adverse effects of harmful educational practices informed my interest in this work and my conviction that representation truly matters.

72
00:08:06,523 --> 00:08:10,126
[SPEAKER_09]: That conviction has impassioned me in my efforts and accomplishments thus far.

73
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:16,973
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been able to bring additional resources into our schools through career readiness pathways and youth employment grant programs.

74
00:08:17,473 --> 00:08:20,836
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been able to work with our CPAC in the city to establish a best buddies program.

75
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:24,360
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be doing composting to our school district, which I'm incredibly excited about.

76
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:28,488
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been able to hire high quality leadership through our different search committees.

77
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:33,136
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm here to speak to everyone tonight about the opportunities that we have in the district.

78
00:08:33,417 --> 00:08:37,925
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited for the opportunity to speak to you about my personal experiences and how I can better impact the community.

79
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:38,446
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

80
00:08:46,237 --> 00:08:46,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, all.

81
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:48,619
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is John Lewis Ntapa.

82
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:51,161
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a candidate for re-election to the Method School Committee.

83
00:08:51,401 --> 00:08:57,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to take a moment and just thank everyone for being here, both the people running this event and also all the candidates.

84
00:08:57,385 --> 00:09:00,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this is the first time the nine of us have been in a room together.

85
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:10,555
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to thank you all for running a campaign that is based on love, that is not done through anger, that is based on what is the best for our students, faculty, and staff.

86
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:19,828
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we all have, you know, our own visions, but we all have the same end goal, and that is for the uplifted support and progress of the Memphis public school systems.

87
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:26,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an unaffiliated progressive candidate whose vision mainly stems around student support and the co-curricular experience.

88
00:09:27,438 --> 00:09:41,043
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of my work in my day job is supporting students, whether that be for student organizations, student activities, student leadership, civic and voting engagement, military veterans and military dependents, and active duty students.

89
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:46,925
[SPEAKER_07]: So I work a lot alongside students being successful outside the classroom, because that's what student success is.

90
00:09:47,065 --> 00:09:51,487
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the handshake between the co-curricular experience and the academics coming together.

91
00:09:51,867 --> 00:09:54,108
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm hoping to talk about that a little bit later on today.

92
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,670
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the product of public education, as I've mentioned before.

93
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the product of a K through BFA public degree.

94
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:02,214
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a product of the Medford public school system.

95
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:12,001
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is what helped me go through the system was that co-curricular experience, whether it be the athletics or the arts department.

96
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:14,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Our nurses, a lot of things got me through.

97
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:18,186
[SPEAKER_07]: I was a student with the 504, so I was very much in the nurse's office a lot.

98
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:23,510
[SPEAKER_07]: And so anything I can do to support them, civic and voting engagement, and more.

99
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:35,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm really here to look at how we can focus on that sense of belonging, focus on that sense of drive to keep our students in school, focused on academics, and figure out a way to make this the best time that they can.

100
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:47,539
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, be perfect community members of our society, and how to be that role model for other students, whether they choose to go into higher ed, whether they choose to go into the armed forces, whether they choose to go into the workforce.

101
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,199
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

102
00:10:53,896 --> 00:10:54,877
[SPEAKER_02]: Jessica Parks.

103
00:10:57,018 --> 00:10:58,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for having us here.

104
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:02,480
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Jessica Parks, and I'm excited to be running for school committee.

105
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:17,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm committed to rethinking our approach to budgeting, expanding opportunities for open and honest dialogue, and most importantly, building systems that support educators and meet the needs of all learners, ensuring everyone is engaged, valued, and heard.

106
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:18,749
[SPEAKER_02]: A year and a half ago, I

107
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not think I would be here.

108
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:28,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched my nine-year-old son, Simon, unexpectedly speak at a school committee meeting in opposition to proposed teacher cuts.

109
00:11:28,672 --> 00:11:39,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing him speak so proudly and unafraid reminded me of why I bring him to these meetings and how powerful community engagement is when we show up, speak out for what we believe in, and do the work even when it's difficult.

110
00:11:41,037 --> 00:11:57,873
[SPEAKER_02]: That reminder was the catalyst for creating a petition signed by over 500 residents on behalf of our Mississippi teachers, which then became volunteering with the Invest in Medford override campaign, where Simon and I knocked on doors every weekend listening to your stories about our schools.

111
00:11:58,293 --> 00:12:02,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these stories highlighted frustration with the lack of an after-school program,

112
00:12:03,518 --> 00:12:10,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Although we made it off the wait list four years ago, I was driven to find solutions through the creation of an afterschool task force.

113
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:16,207
[SPEAKER_02]: As a planner and project manager, I have a track record of strategic thinking and creative problem solving.

114
00:12:16,908 --> 00:12:24,353
[SPEAKER_02]: As such, I focused our task force on case studies and data from five neighboring districts and 64 afterschool programs.

115
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:30,118
[SPEAKER_02]: This work helped move the discussion forward, allowing us to focus on the potential of our district program.

116
00:12:31,058 --> 00:12:35,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Although we just started we've already seen a 21 percent increase in spots.

117
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:43,825
[SPEAKER_02]: We expanded the task force to include representation from each school and brought in an external consultant to develop strategies for scaling up.

118
00:12:44,445 --> 00:12:55,732
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the kind of collaboration and action I will bring to the school committee by listening to needs assembling the right team analyzing data and turning ideas into real measurable results to be tracked over time.

119
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:56,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

120
00:13:03,618 --> 00:13:07,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Jenny Graham, and I'm proud to be running for my fourth term on the school committee.

121
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Medford is turning a corner.

122
00:13:09,921 --> 00:13:16,564
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been laying the groundwork for real transformation, and I'm ready to keep pushing forward to make sure that our schools are places where every student can thrive.

123
00:13:17,445 --> 00:13:19,766
[SPEAKER_12]: Over the last six years, we've made historic progress.

124
00:13:20,226 --> 00:13:25,549
[SPEAKER_12]: Most recently, we asked Medford to pass two ballot questions that bring $7 million to our schools each year.

125
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:32,132
[SPEAKER_12]: This ends the cycle of cuts and allows us to invest in excellence, not just to survive, but to improve.

126
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:39,778
[SPEAKER_12]: I worked hard to make the case to city leaders that we needed more than a short-term fix that saves 40 jobs after a bad budget session.

127
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:45,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Instead, I made the case that we needed to think of the ballot measures as the central way for us to move forward and improve.

128
00:13:46,544 --> 00:13:48,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Passing the overrides was just the beginning.

129
00:13:48,425 --> 00:13:55,732
[SPEAKER_12]: It allowed us to negotiate a new school schedule that gives students more time to learn and grow, and to fix structural issues with the schedule at the high school.

130
00:13:56,332 --> 00:14:04,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Today, more students have access to AP classes, the arts, electives, and all of that thanks to thoughtful contract negotiations.

131
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:17,831
[SPEAKER_12]: As the lead of the negotiating team, we've settled 11 contracts in just a few years, improving efficiency, building repeatable systems, structures that work for students, and making historic investments in compensation so Medford can be competitive.

132
00:14:18,932 --> 00:14:26,155
[SPEAKER_12]: As the chair of the building committee, we've moved the Medford High School project ahead of schedule in the MSBA process, which saves Medford time and money.

133
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:31,377
[SPEAKER_12]: We met with the architect today and we're planning the next phase, which includes input from all of you.

134
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:34,438
[SPEAKER_12]: In my next term, I'll keep pushing forward.

135
00:14:34,658 --> 00:14:38,700
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll continue to lead the building committee and fight for the budget our students deserve.

136
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,122
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll bring greater transparency to district finances to continue the work that we've already been doing.

137
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:47,986
[SPEAKER_12]: We're launching our first-ever strategic plan that begins with community input.

138
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:54,772
[SPEAKER_12]: This work is close to my heart because I do it in my day job, and I know that real change comes to organizations who listen first.

139
00:14:55,232 --> 00:15:02,218
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be listening to many voices as we shape that plan, address space constraints, and improve the quality of the school experience for everyone.

140
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:10,025
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm focused on expanding wraparound supports, including after-school, summer care, special ed, and pre-K, and you'll hear the rest in my closing remarks.

141
00:15:17,143 --> 00:15:27,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Lisa Kingsley, and I'm the mom of three Medford public school students and a lifelong educator who spent nearly 20 years helping schools work better for kids and families.

142
00:15:28,446 --> 00:15:39,468
[SPEAKER_00]: I began my career as a special education teacher, where I saw firsthand how powerful it can be when students feel seen and supported, and how frustrating it can be when systems seem to get in their way.

143
00:15:40,088 --> 00:15:41,529
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what led me to go into leadership.

144
00:15:41,629 --> 00:15:46,510
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to help build schools that centered student needs and improved outcomes for all.

145
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:50,211
[SPEAKER_00]: I led a special education at a nearby charter school.

146
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:54,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I served as principal of Curtis Tufts High School here in Medford.

147
00:15:54,832 --> 00:15:57,652
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran therapeutic and alternative programs in Malden.

148
00:15:58,452 --> 00:16:09,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently, I've been earning my doctorate in education leadership from Harvard, also graduating with my superintendent license and experience coaching superintendent teams from across the country.

149
00:16:10,175 --> 00:16:13,119
[SPEAKER_00]: But my heart hasn't left Medford.

150
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:26,656
[SPEAKER_00]: As a board member for the MFN, a Girl Scout leader, and a Girls on the Run coach, I am deeply connected to the community and am constantly listening when families want to share what's working and what's not in our school system.

151
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:31,680
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running for school committee now because Medford is at a turning point.

152
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:38,104
[SPEAKER_00]: This term, we are selecting a permanent superintendent and shaping a long-term strategic plan.

153
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:44,387
[SPEAKER_00]: Rare opportunities to set a clear vision, align resources, and build trust with our families.

154
00:16:45,147 --> 00:16:53,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And while the new high school continues to be an exciting priority, we also must keep sight of the day-to-day work of teaching, learning, and governing well.

155
00:16:54,194 --> 00:17:05,438
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essential that somebody at the table has lived experience of how system decisions ripple down into classrooms and understands the importance of centering student need in all conversations.

156
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:11,060
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the inside of the classroom and the governance levers that can shape student experience.

157
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:17,243
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope to serve on the school committee to ensure that we can move from good intentions to data-driven results.

158
00:17:17,763 --> 00:17:18,083
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

159
00:17:22,722 --> 00:17:24,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicole Branly.

160
00:17:24,623 --> 00:17:31,087
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Nicole Branly, and I'm currently serving my first term as a school committee member and running for re-election.

161
00:17:32,007 --> 00:17:40,812
[SPEAKER_11]: I have worked diligently during my first term to learn, to listen, and to use my voice for our staff, our students, families, and community.

162
00:17:41,652 --> 00:17:52,606
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm proud to have been educated in Medford Public Schools, graduating from Medford High School, and I'm proud of both my daughter, who just graduated this year from Medford High, and my son, who's currently a 10th grader here.

163
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:59,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I have been both a cheerleader and a critic to Medford Public Schools, advocating for what is best for all of our students.

164
00:18:00,495 --> 00:18:06,758
[SPEAKER_11]: I have worked in public education for nearly a decade, with six of those years as a paraprofessional here in Medford Public Schools.

165
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:16,202
[SPEAKER_11]: Currently, I work, like other candidates, in Somerville Special Education Department for nearly three years now.

166
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:25,210
[SPEAKER_11]: I have been honored to walk into City Hall to represent all of our city as an independent thinking school committee member.

167
00:18:25,991 --> 00:18:27,272
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not a politician.

168
00:18:27,292 --> 00:18:29,454
[SPEAKER_11]: I am a mom who ran for office.

169
00:18:30,094 --> 00:18:33,077
[SPEAKER_11]: I won a grassroots campaign and I want to do it again.

170
00:18:33,097 --> 00:18:41,184
[SPEAKER_11]: No one should walk into City Hall for themselves, but for the people of this city and for me focusing on our public school system.

171
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:55,394
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to continue the important work we do and be part of the decisions that will mold our future, most notably choosing a new superintendent in the future of our Medford High School, Medford Vocational Technical High School campus.

172
00:18:56,515 --> 00:19:09,079
[SPEAKER_11]: No one job in public education is more important than the next, because at the end of the day, it's about a student, someone's child, and what happens in our schools spills directly into our neighborhoods, and that affects us all.

173
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:09,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

174
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:14,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Erica Reinfeld.

175
00:19:15,406 --> 00:19:15,786
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

176
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:16,546
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, everyone.

177
00:19:16,606 --> 00:19:17,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for being here.

178
00:19:18,046 --> 00:19:19,447
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Erica Reinfeld.

179
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:20,547
[SPEAKER_10]: She, her pronouns.

180
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:22,808
[SPEAKER_10]: And I am running for re-election.

181
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:25,148
[SPEAKER_10]: My wife and I have lived in Medford Square since 2005.

182
00:19:25,609 --> 00:19:29,810
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have two children, one at the Roberts, one at the high school.

183
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:37,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a longtime STEM educator, and I currently manage the public outreach program at MIT's Astrophysics Research Center.

184
00:19:37,752 --> 00:19:52,970
[SPEAKER_10]: As an educator, my focus has always been on interdisciplinary approaches, and I've spent my whole career trying to bring people and resources together to create learning environments and experiences that get people excited about and engaged in their own learning.

185
00:19:54,321 --> 00:20:01,206
[SPEAKER_10]: I ran for school committee two years ago because I thought this was a perspective that the committee needed, and I'm really excited to continue the work that I've been doing.

186
00:20:01,746 --> 00:20:13,655
[SPEAKER_10]: Very briefly, I'd say that the top two themes of my first term have been pushing the district to address longstanding challenges and advocating for clear articulation of community values and expectations.

187
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:27,704
[SPEAKER_10]: These are both things that I intend to continue doing, but in my second term I'm also excited to focus more energy on enhancing our academic offerings for students, particularly those who need extra support and or extra challenges.

188
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:33,328
[SPEAKER_10]: I think my perspective as a museum educator and evaluator can be hugely helpful with that.

189
00:20:33,868 --> 00:20:40,190
[SPEAKER_10]: but I know it won't be the only thing I get to work on if I'm re-elected, and I know I won't always get to work on the things that I'm passionate about.

190
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,992
[SPEAKER_10]: There are big, hard challenges ahead, and also great, exciting opportunities.

191
00:20:45,492 --> 00:20:57,756
[SPEAKER_10]: We can't talk about all of them tonight, so I will just end this introduction with an invitation to connect with me afterwards about any of the issues raised on the stage tonight, and with a promise to bring my best self to this work.

192
00:21:02,118 --> 00:21:02,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul Rousseau.

193
00:21:04,194 --> 00:21:09,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, and thank you to my fellow candidates for stepping forward and putting yourselves out there.

194
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:17,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Running for office is no small thing, especially when many of us are juggling full-time jobs, family responsibilities, and the added commitment to serve.

195
00:21:18,472 --> 00:21:21,035
[SPEAKER_06]: The commitment deserves recognition.

196
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:23,398
[SPEAKER_06]: It's dedication, plain and simple.

197
00:21:24,562 --> 00:21:28,465
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Paul Rousseau, and I'm running for my fifth term on the Medford School Committee.

198
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:36,992
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the past eight years, I've seen dramatic change across our school committee, our public schools, our city council, and our community.

199
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:41,896
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm energized by that progress, and I'm eager to keep pushing forward.

200
00:21:43,017 --> 00:21:46,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Our public schools aren't just where we educate our kids.

201
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,322
[SPEAKER_06]: They're the backbone of Medford.

202
00:21:49,062 --> 00:21:52,365
[SPEAKER_06]: They shape our future, reflect our values, and hold us together.

203
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:57,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew up as one of the low-income kids I suspect we'll hear about tonight.

204
00:21:58,706 --> 00:22:02,667
[SPEAKER_06]: This lived experience informs nearly every decision I make.

205
00:22:03,287 --> 00:22:10,589
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't speak to the backgrounds of my fellow candidates, but I can tell you that growing up with food and housing insecurity changes you.

206
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:13,250
[SPEAKER_06]: It gives you a lens you can never put down.

207
00:22:14,538 --> 00:22:20,083
[SPEAKER_06]: As we face uncertainty in the years ahead, I'll bring a steady hand to the tough decisions.

208
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:26,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll fight to ensure that our students, with the least, never get less, especially if we face a financial crisis.

209
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:37,407
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll also continue championing the new high school project working to ensure we build a zero carbon building that reflects our values and protects our future.

210
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:43,569
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight's questions will touch on many of the complex issues school committee candidates face.

211
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:51,673
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe every member should come prepared having done the research spoken with the professionals in our schools and kept an open mind.

212
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:53,894
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how we solve problems together.

213
00:22:54,214 --> 00:22:54,534
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

214
00:22:59,234 --> 00:23:01,556
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to all the candidates for their opening statement.

215
00:23:02,377 --> 00:23:05,139
[SPEAKER_05]: We will now conduct the Q&A portion of tonight's forum.

216
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:11,484
[SPEAKER_05]: The questions will be asked in three rounds with each candidate responding in the order previously determined.

217
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:15,387
[SPEAKER_05]: We have developed 27 questions for tonight's forum.

218
00:23:16,227 --> 00:23:18,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Each candidate will draw a question from a glass bowl.

219
00:23:20,851 --> 00:23:24,614
[SPEAKER_05]: The question will be provided to the moderator who will ask the questions to the candidate.

220
00:23:25,415 --> 00:23:28,057
[SPEAKER_05]: The candidate will then have two minutes to respond as they wish.

221
00:23:29,893 --> 00:23:32,735
[SPEAKER_05]: The first round begins with candidate Mastro Brioni.

222
00:23:33,656 --> 00:23:36,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Please draw a question from the bowl and return to the volunteer.

223
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope that's a good one.

224
00:23:55,951 --> 00:24:02,396
[SPEAKER_05]: What motivates you to run for school committee and what particular skills or experience qualify you to serve?

225
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:06,559
[SPEAKER_05]: So to repeat the question.

226
00:24:08,881 --> 00:24:15,807
[SPEAKER_05]: What motivates you to run for school committee and what particular skills or experience qualify you to serve?

227
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:22,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, and thank you for your patience.

228
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:24,742
[SPEAKER_08]: 27 questions is a lot.

229
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:42,987
[SPEAKER_08]: So what motivated me to run for school committee again is, and I've spoken with a lot of folks about this when I'm out canvassing, is one of the coolest things that's happened to me in my family is when my son Lincoln, he's now seven, he's in second grade at the Roberts, when he started school.

230
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:47,528
[SPEAKER_08]: At that time, we had been in Medford about four years or so.

231
00:24:49,108 --> 00:24:57,594
[SPEAKER_08]: And the way that the school community really enveloped us became our friendship circle became our family up here was.

232
00:24:59,452 --> 00:25:00,013
[SPEAKER_08]: transformative.

233
00:25:00,553 --> 00:25:05,197
[SPEAKER_08]: It really changed the way my family lives our life.

234
00:25:05,657 --> 00:25:06,478
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's great.

235
00:25:06,598 --> 00:25:08,100
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to give back to that community.

236
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to give back to Medford since day one when I moved here.

237
00:25:12,343 --> 00:25:15,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I started out by trying some volunteer opportunities.

238
00:25:15,906 --> 00:25:21,231
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm currently a commissioner on the Water and Sewer Commission, where I look at water and sewer rates and long-term planning.

239
00:25:21,251 --> 00:25:21,832
[SPEAKER_08]: That sets up

240
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:26,875
[SPEAKER_08]: That matches really well with my skill set, which again is municipal finance.

241
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:41,046
[SPEAKER_08]: What municipal finance is, it's taking complicated problems and complicated rule sets in Massachusetts law and explaining them to residents, to colleagues, to subject matter experts to help them solve their problems.

242
00:25:41,887 --> 00:25:43,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Every day I go to work thinking, how can I

243
00:25:45,163 --> 00:25:49,587
[SPEAKER_08]: create the decision architecture that supports progress in Somerville in my day job.

244
00:25:49,828 --> 00:25:50,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to do the same thing here.

245
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:51,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the skills I have.

246
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:55,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the skills that I'm ready to be using here for school committee on day one.

247
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:08,887
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think when you're putting together any team, it's really valuable to have someone with municipal finance experience, whether it's a city council, a school committee, a mayor's team, or any administration.

248
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:10,949
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my motivation.

249
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm really fired up to get to work and help Medford, and that's my skill set.

250
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:15,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

251
00:26:43,995 --> 00:26:48,096
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you believe the primary roles and responsibilities of a school committee are?

252
00:26:49,397 --> 00:26:54,078
[SPEAKER_05]: Provide some examples of the differences between the school committee's role and the superintendent's role.

253
00:26:55,638 --> 00:26:56,459
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that question.

254
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:03,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the school committee's primary role is to be the governing body for public education in any municipal government.

255
00:27:04,061 --> 00:27:12,023
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that it's supposed to be the bridge between what the general population understands about public education and what the government is trying to accomplish.

256
00:27:12,523 --> 00:27:37,517
[SPEAKER_09]: We understand that at the state level there's a lot of decisions that are made that reverberate in our local government, in our local cities and communities, but a lot of the time the general public doesn't have the capacity, the time to actually be informed on what's going on because they're busy, they have kids, they're working day to day, and so who's responsible for communicating out to the public what we're trying to accomplish in the classroom and in the school and in the district?

257
00:27:38,117 --> 00:27:41,878
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not only the superintendent offices responsibly, but the school committee.

258
00:27:42,278 --> 00:27:52,542
[SPEAKER_09]: We're tasked with not only balancing the budget, but also incorporating the asks and the requests of families, constituents, kinships into the day-to-day operations of the school system.

259
00:27:53,022 --> 00:27:55,943
[SPEAKER_09]: The superintendent's job is then to make those things happen.

260
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:02,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that as a school committee, we can always do more to communicate what we want to see as a general public.

261
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:20,777
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing how we're informing our students, preparing them for post-grad life, making sure we have access to the arts, athletics, extracurriculars that students are excited about, and the superintendent's job is to then hire the proper personnel to task people properly and make sure that that's actually happening in public.

262
00:28:20,797 --> 00:28:22,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there another portion of that question?

263
00:28:22,318 --> 00:28:23,959
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that was all of it.

264
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:29,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Provide some examples of the difference between the school committee's role and the superintendent's role.

265
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:34,550
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the lasting portion is that school committee is tasked primarily with policy and budgets, like I said.

266
00:28:34,931 --> 00:28:49,943
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that we understand what things are happening at the federal and state level, and we then need to communicate that to the superintendent's office, as well as, as I mentioned, to the general public about what types of things need to happen, and how we're going to make them happen through the budgets that we're receiving from the city, and how that, you know, how that will,

267
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:54,807
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess disseminate might be the word, but how that actually is going to be appropriated properly.

268
00:28:55,067 --> 00:28:57,789
[SPEAKER_09]: And the superintendent's job, I think, is to then make that a reality.

269
00:28:58,449 --> 00:28:58,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

270
00:29:01,871 --> 00:29:02,572
[SPEAKER_05]: John Antapa.

271
00:29:22,229 --> 00:29:26,311
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your views on school safety policies and disciplinary practices?

272
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:32,133
[SPEAKER_05]: What steps would you take to address behavioral and mental health challenges facing students and staff?

273
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:34,654
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a really great one.

274
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,256
[SPEAKER_07]: Six years ago was the first time I ran.

275
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:38,956
[SPEAKER_07]: I ran at the age of 18.

276
00:29:39,016 --> 00:29:44,358
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was a lot because of these school safety concerns and mental health issues.

277
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:51,021
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the product of an unfortunate time in America where school shootings seemed to be like, oh, that happened again.

278
00:29:52,181 --> 00:30:05,970
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember very vividly while they were doing construction down the street they would announce that they were doing controlled explosions and being in a classroom with no windows and no escape route and that being the most anxious part of the day.

279
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:20,959
[SPEAKER_07]: because of that, and not knowing if this was a safe building, knowing that there was one entrance and one exit, thinking about the awfulness of that, and that severely impacted my mental health, and a few other things, and I've been very, very open about that.

280
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:24,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I think in terms of, you know, school safety, we need to look at the source.

281
00:30:24,941 --> 00:30:29,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know, you know, we've talked about or I've talked about revisiting, you know,

282
00:30:31,305 --> 00:30:31,986
[SPEAKER_07]: lockdown drills?

283
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:35,649
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we do that in a way that doesn't further traumatize our students?

284
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:41,853
[SPEAKER_07]: How do we do that in a way that our faculty and staff feel prepared for a situation where we find that middle ground?

285
00:30:43,535 --> 00:30:45,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, you know, how, what,

286
00:30:46,297 --> 00:30:49,498
[SPEAKER_07]: For school safety, what does a safe school look like from a faculty perspective?

287
00:30:49,538 --> 00:30:51,058
[SPEAKER_07]: What does it look like from a student perspective?

288
00:30:51,078 --> 00:30:52,878
[SPEAKER_07]: And what does it look like from a staff perspective?

289
00:30:53,719 --> 00:31:07,402
[SPEAKER_07]: My background is in industrial design, and so designing experiences and systems that a bunch of users put their input into in terms of how it looks like is where we have to start in terms of, where are the pain points?

290
00:31:07,522 --> 00:31:09,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Where do we feel like the building isn't safe?

291
00:31:09,362 --> 00:31:12,843
[SPEAKER_07]: And how do we do it where we're not advocating for the ridiculous thought of,

292
00:31:13,563 --> 00:31:19,965
[SPEAKER_07]: educators carrying firearms or a bunch of metal detectors doing the building, because that's going to affect people's mental health.

293
00:31:20,025 --> 00:31:26,166
[SPEAKER_07]: When your building looks like a prison and feels like a prison even more than this building does, you're going to have success rates drop.

294
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:32,828
[SPEAKER_07]: And so finding that, I keep saying balance, but that balance of safety and also well-being is where we need to go.

295
00:31:33,008 --> 00:31:35,768
[SPEAKER_07]: So I hope I answered the question to the fullest, but thank you.

296
00:31:39,709 --> 00:31:40,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny Graham.

297
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, excuse me, Jessica Parks.

298
00:32:00,233 --> 00:32:05,762
[SPEAKER_05]: What ideas do you have to engage parents and taxpayers to ensure their voices are heard?

299
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:23,717
[SPEAKER_02]: So I believe that communication needs to be more consistent transparent and easily accessible.

300
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:37,931
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that families and caregivers often send multiple e-mails on the same topic to school officials because they believe information isn't shared properly or clearly and I

301
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:45,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Educators and staff I speak with feel they lack a voice outside of bargaining periods.

302
00:32:45,197 --> 00:32:55,281
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really need to kind of work on providing clear and consistent information about what's happening across the district both externally and internally.

303
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:10,691
[SPEAKER_02]: And ways to do that in order to kind of, because when staff and school committee members are receiving multiple emails on the same topic, it takes away from their day-to-day.

304
00:33:10,711 --> 00:33:11,951
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes away from the teaching.

305
00:33:11,971 --> 00:33:13,612
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes away from the leading.

306
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:18,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes away from everything if they have to answer individual emails.

307
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:22,800
[SPEAKER_02]: parents need to feel that they're being heard.

308
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:33,971
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that, you know, websites that are easy to navigate, I think if there are topics that are hot button topics, you know those ahead of time.

309
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:37,155
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that after school is going to be a hot button topic.

310
00:33:37,235 --> 00:33:38,136
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that

311
00:33:39,097 --> 00:33:42,379
[SPEAKER_02]: A change in curriculum is going to be a hot-button topic.

312
00:33:42,439 --> 00:33:51,887
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that bus schedules are going to be a hot-button topic, and if bus timing is changing, you need to be able to communicate that clearly.

313
00:33:52,607 --> 00:34:05,778
[SPEAKER_02]: So doing the communication up front and making sure that it's happening regularly through different methods of communication, not just a website, but it's the website, it's the email,

314
00:34:06,538 --> 00:34:12,942
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the talking points, because not everyone understands things the same way.

315
00:34:14,063 --> 00:34:14,964
[SPEAKER_02]: People are visual.

316
00:34:15,124 --> 00:34:16,985
[SPEAKER_02]: People like to hear things.

317
00:34:17,085 --> 00:34:19,447
[SPEAKER_02]: People like to read things at their own time.

318
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:27,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And making sure you're tapping all of those different outlets, I think that could help a lot and go a long way.

319
00:34:27,892 --> 00:34:34,576
[SPEAKER_02]: As a project manager, I work with buildings that are occupied, and I carry out projects in them.

320
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:45,821
[SPEAKER_02]: I did recently did a project in a lab building and they were carrying out research while I was going in and doing HVAC work and we have to communicate with those buildings.

321
00:34:46,141 --> 00:34:46,301
[SPEAKER_02]: So.

322
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:47,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Jenny Graham.

323
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:17,980
[SPEAKER_05]: What role do you think school committees should play in supporting the rights of gender-flexible students?

324
00:35:21,402 --> 00:35:25,185
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's a whole lot of a role for the school committee to play.

325
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:26,787
[SPEAKER_12]: We are the makers of policy.

326
00:35:28,068 --> 00:35:33,192
[SPEAKER_12]: When we don't set policy, the superintendent has the latitude to do the same.

327
00:35:33,712 --> 00:35:43,540
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think when we talk about the values of the community and making sure that all of our students feel like they belong here, we have a great responsibility to make sure that that's true.

328
00:35:44,441 --> 00:35:47,384
[SPEAKER_12]: We have already passed policy to do just that.

329
00:35:48,164 --> 00:35:52,406
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also have the ability to back it up.

330
00:35:52,506 --> 00:35:55,247
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not just about saying this is what we shall do.

331
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:56,787
[SPEAKER_12]: That's good.

332
00:35:57,027 --> 00:35:57,667
[SPEAKER_12]: It's important.

333
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:04,490
[SPEAKER_12]: But more importantly, then we have to prioritize what it takes to implement those policies in a way that's authentic.

334
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,811
[SPEAKER_12]: And that brings all of our staff along so that we can have a consistent experience for students.

335
00:36:11,012 --> 00:36:16,733
[SPEAKER_12]: I was really heartened this year when the year started with a theme from the interim superintendent, which was belonging.

336
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:22,835
[SPEAKER_12]: And that means that everybody who walks through the doors feels like they belong here.

337
00:36:23,569 --> 00:36:25,390
[SPEAKER_12]: and or in the building that they are in.

338
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:29,453
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's also great.

339
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:33,375
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know that that's just one more step.

340
00:36:33,475 --> 00:36:35,977
[SPEAKER_12]: So we also have to prioritize professional development.

341
00:36:36,517 --> 00:36:46,203
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to prioritize the supports that teachers need to be able to do this work staff nurses everybody in the building who comes together to make this happen for students.

342
00:36:47,924 --> 00:36:48,725
[SPEAKER_12]: We have done that.

343
00:36:48,805 --> 00:36:56,452
[SPEAKER_12]: We have been working hard to increase the amount of professional development, which we have done in this most recent teacher contract.

344
00:36:56,532 --> 00:37:00,656
[SPEAKER_12]: So we went from having three professional full days to five.

345
00:37:02,277 --> 00:37:10,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Those two days that we gained are well in excess from a value perspective to what we used to do with dribs and drabs of hours on half days.

346
00:37:11,866 --> 00:37:24,535
[SPEAKER_12]: So while the kids might have liked half days, from a professional development perspective, we're set up to really be able to create time and space for the things that we need to do to help our educators thrive and help them help students belong.

347
00:37:25,275 --> 00:37:25,575
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

348
00:37:29,658 --> 00:37:30,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Lisa Kingsley.

349
00:37:51,608 --> 00:37:52,369
[SPEAKER_04]: The suspense.

350
00:37:54,632 --> 00:37:59,177
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you see is the district's greatest strengths and weaknesses regarding student achievement?

351
00:37:59,658 --> 00:38:00,479
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you proud of?

352
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:02,181
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you like to see improved?

353
00:38:06,228 --> 00:38:08,851
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much to be proud of in Medford.

354
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:19,761
[SPEAKER_00]: When my family made the choice 12 years ago to determine which community to move into, it was pretty easy to determine that Medford was where we wanted to be.

355
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:25,987
[SPEAKER_00]: The diversity that we have in the community that we've built continue to be things that are

356
00:38:27,468 --> 00:38:33,572
[SPEAKER_00]: drive me to want to be here and that have been a hallmark of my children's experience in the schools.

357
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:39,537
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my first year of graduating out of Brooks Elementary School with one of my children.

358
00:38:39,557 --> 00:38:41,898
[SPEAKER_00]: And the middle school transition is scary.

359
00:38:41,938 --> 00:38:43,840
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a long time as a middle school teacher.

360
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:57,552
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fact that he has been welcomed and successful and happy in this really tough transition into sixth grade is just one mini example of what Medford and our schools can do for everyone.

361
00:38:58,312 --> 00:39:09,082
[SPEAKER_00]: An area that I want to make sure we continue to attend to and grow is the use of data and to make sure that we don't just feel good in our schools, but that our student outcomes are reflecting how we feel.

362
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:16,025
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our most recent MCAS results resulted in a lot of things and a lot of areas of growth.

363
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:19,967
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have areas in which we need to continue to attend to.

364
00:39:19,987 --> 00:39:34,513
[SPEAKER_00]: The disproportionality of our students with disabilities and their achievement as compared to some of their peers across the state continue to be an area that I would want to attend to and that I'm uniquely qualified to support given 20 years in special education.

365
00:39:35,053 --> 00:39:48,437
[SPEAKER_00]: So, taking that feeling of community and belonging and combining it with some of our need for data-driven analysis and using that information to set policy kind of, I hope, speaks to both sides of that question.

366
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:49,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

367
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:54,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Nicole Brandlue.

368
00:39:54,579 --> 00:40:02,522
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

369
00:40:06,766 --> 00:40:08,987
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll get the worst question ever.

370
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:27,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you believe that students should have access in the classrooms to the personal devices like phones, tablets, laptops for research or learning tools?

371
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:34,435
[SPEAKER_05]: How should the school committee ensure equity for students who might be unable to afford such technology?

372
00:40:35,153 --> 00:40:36,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, can you read the question one more time?

373
00:40:36,594 --> 00:40:36,794
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

374
00:40:37,595 --> 00:40:47,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you believe that students should have access in the classroom to their personal devices like phones, tablets, or laptops for research or to use learning tools?

375
00:40:47,984 --> 00:40:54,010
[SPEAKER_05]: How should the school committee ensure equity for students who might be unable to afford such technology?

376
00:40:56,151 --> 00:40:56,412
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

377
00:40:57,462 --> 00:41:07,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, as a mom of a teenager, two teenagers, one in high school and one in college, technology should really be enhancing our learning, not replacing it.

378
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:15,235
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to use digital tools to expand opportunities, but balance with the human connection and hands-on experience.

379
00:41:15,876 --> 00:41:18,258
[SPEAKER_11]: We need students to actually be thinking.

380
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,721
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked a lot about AI in one of our previous meetings.

381
00:41:23,921 --> 00:41:26,283
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe that's definitely a double-edged sword.

382
00:41:27,504 --> 00:41:30,185
[SPEAKER_11]: Access to phones for research, absolutely.

383
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:33,828
[SPEAKER_11]: Access to phones for Snapchat during school, probably not.

384
00:41:35,128 --> 00:41:40,872
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's important that kids are focused on their teachers, they're focused on the curriculum, and that they're focused on learning.

385
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:42,173
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

386
00:41:47,336 --> 00:41:48,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Erika Reinfeld.

387
00:42:08,911 --> 00:42:14,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Should we increase or reduce the resources applied to special needs or English language learners?

388
00:42:15,473 --> 00:42:16,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Please explain.

389
00:42:18,053 --> 00:42:20,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the schools can always do with more resources.

390
00:42:21,995 --> 00:42:30,377
[SPEAKER_10]: But yes, I think one of the big challenges is meeting the individual needs of particular students.

391
00:42:31,357 --> 00:42:34,818
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we look at some of the outcomes, we see trends

392
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:37,628
[SPEAKER_10]: that are not good.

393
00:42:38,549 --> 00:42:45,574
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we have to address those, and we have to look at the trends at how things have happened over the years.

394
00:42:46,195 --> 00:43:03,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are absolutely resources that we can put into this, high quality curricula, training, both of the students, of the teachers and educators providing the direct services, and also the students, sorry, the staff and teachers who touch their lives and their education in other ways.

395
00:43:04,288 --> 00:43:11,297
[SPEAKER_10]: But there are also things that we can do that don't specifically need more money.

396
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:16,583
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of this is around intentionality and looking and saying, this right here is the problem.

397
00:43:16,603 --> 00:43:17,805
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what the data says.

398
00:43:18,385 --> 00:43:19,767
[SPEAKER_10]: And this is why it says that.

399
00:43:20,127 --> 00:43:21,849
[SPEAKER_10]: This is what's happening in the schools.

400
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,391
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're going to set a goal.

401
00:43:24,132 --> 00:43:34,619
[SPEAKER_10]: a meaningful, achievable goal that is still a little bit aspirational, and we're going to devote the resources and the attention and the training to meet that goal.

402
00:43:35,099 --> 00:43:37,200
[SPEAKER_10]: We're not going to try to do everything at once.

403
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:45,065
[SPEAKER_10]: We will get to things, but we will prioritize, and we will put the resources where they will be most valuable.

404
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:51,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul Rousseau.

405
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,213
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the one I want.

406
00:43:57,233 --> 00:43:58,774
I hope.

407
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Medford need a new high school building?

408
00:44:18,131 --> 00:44:20,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Please provide examples supporting that choice.

409
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:22,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you repeat that?

410
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:23,391
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

411
00:44:23,531 --> 00:44:25,892
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed the beginning of it.

412
00:44:25,952 --> 00:44:27,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Does Medford need a new high school building?

413
00:44:28,994 --> 00:44:31,156
[SPEAKER_05]: Please provide examples supporting that choice.

414
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:33,257
[SPEAKER_05]: That feels like a softball.

415
00:44:33,597 --> 00:44:33,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

416
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:35,319
[SPEAKER_05]: They were randomly assigned.

417
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:37,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Medford needs a new high school.

418
00:44:41,217 --> 00:44:42,298
[SPEAKER_06]: Examples of why?

419
00:44:42,378 --> 00:44:43,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Was that the other part of that?

420
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:44,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

421
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:50,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I appreciate everybody that's here, but this room is a good example of why.

422
00:44:50,844 --> 00:44:55,468
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to have a theater that is substantially larger.

423
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:58,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the entire student body should be able to be together.

424
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,752
[SPEAKER_06]: It's literally impossible.

425
00:45:02,737 --> 00:45:11,439
[SPEAKER_06]: This building also, I'm the secretary of the school committee and I sign the warrants, which means the bills have to be signed by my name in order to be paid.

426
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:20,481
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can tell you that our electric and gas consumption in this building is nothing short of a horror story.

427
00:45:22,262 --> 00:45:32,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though we spend enormous amounts of money to heat this building, there's still plenty of rooms that are freezing cold.

428
00:45:34,205 --> 00:45:40,330
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, in the summer or in the warmer months, some rooms are hot, some rooms are cold.

429
00:45:41,171 --> 00:45:45,314
[SPEAKER_06]: So basic climate control is not an option in this building.

430
00:45:45,835 --> 00:45:51,760
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's plenty of studies that show that there is an optimal climate for learning.

431
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:59,886
[SPEAKER_06]: And so in order to give our kids and, frankly, our staff an optimal climate for actually teaching,

432
00:46:00,927 --> 00:46:02,948
[SPEAKER_06]: This building can never be that building.

433
00:46:03,529 --> 00:46:14,876
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I am very excited to be on the school building committee and look forward to paying my 50 bucks or whatever it will cost to get a sledgehammer when we have that activity.

434
00:46:14,896 --> 00:46:19,560
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of schools do this when they knock down a building.

435
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,822
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds very fun until you hit the wall.

436
00:46:22,882 --> 00:46:24,383
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure it doesn't feel quite as good.

437
00:46:26,645 --> 00:46:37,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, this building does not serve the needs of the students the way it needs to, and I feel like it was an easy question, but I could go on for half an hour on this, so thank you.

438
00:46:43,941 --> 00:46:46,203
[SPEAKER_03]: That concludes the first round of questions.

439
00:46:46,243 --> 00:46:48,124
[SPEAKER_03]: We will now proceed to round two.

440
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:50,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael Mastriaboni.

441
00:47:11,273 --> 00:47:11,473
[SPEAKER_03]: God.

442
00:47:11,553 --> 00:47:12,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, here we go.

443
00:47:13,374 --> 00:47:26,522
[SPEAKER_03]: What changes should we make to the vocational school programs to respond to changing job roles like fewer industrial jobs and artificial intelligence changing the function of business management jobs?

444
00:47:29,162 --> 00:47:30,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that question.

445
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:40,166
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things I've heard most consistently canvassing over the last couple months is what a resource and how valuable having a vocational technical school is.

446
00:47:42,605 --> 00:47:47,248
[SPEAKER_08]: So much excitement about what a gem that is and so much opportunity for improvement.

447
00:47:47,908 --> 00:47:52,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Folks are telling about really exciting things that Arlington is doing with their vocational school.

448
00:47:54,292 --> 00:48:04,258
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've seen firsthand through the Somerville High School project what a great auto tech shop can look like and what a great cooking program can look like.

449
00:48:04,618 --> 00:48:08,984
[SPEAKER_08]: to prepare our kids and our neighbors for the next phase of life.

450
00:48:09,024 --> 00:48:11,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Student success looks like a million things.

451
00:48:11,468 --> 00:48:12,890
[SPEAKER_08]: It can look like AP classes.

452
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,492
[SPEAKER_08]: It can look like athletics.

453
00:48:14,552 --> 00:48:17,055
[SPEAKER_08]: It can look like vocational technical training.

454
00:48:19,621 --> 00:48:24,384
[SPEAKER_08]: Without a doubt, every person I've talked to in the last few months wants to expand the vocational school.

455
00:48:24,884 --> 00:48:28,826
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to open it up as much as possible to the community.

456
00:48:29,187 --> 00:48:31,768
[SPEAKER_08]: They want to integrate it into the rest of the high school.

457
00:48:32,188 --> 00:48:36,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that I talked about with someone on the doors very, very recently, and that really

458
00:48:38,692 --> 00:48:47,020
[SPEAKER_08]: really got me fired up was how her student that was on a traditional path felt like they missed out on opportunities for technical school.

459
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:54,106
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we separate the technical school and the traditional path and those students sort of go about their business in their own way, we miss that cross-pollination.

460
00:48:54,146 --> 00:48:55,207
[SPEAKER_08]: We miss that opportunity.

461
00:48:55,608 --> 00:49:02,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is something that can really ignite, you know, the spark of curiosity in a 14-year-old and a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old.

462
00:49:03,795 --> 00:49:22,347
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, part of building the high school, part of building a new high school, which, yes, we definitely have to do, easy question, should be thinking about how we integrate the vocational school more into the built environment of what we've got here so that there's that cross-pollination, there's that opportunity, there's those conversations between kids.

463
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:27,430
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, I'm so proud of the vocational school and I think there's so much opportunity there.

464
00:49:31,392 --> 00:49:32,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Erin Olopade.

465
00:49:46,736 --> 00:49:50,545
[SPEAKER_03]: In the past, teachers' contracts have languished to the point of crises.

466
00:49:51,347 --> 00:49:55,838
[SPEAKER_03]: What can the school committee do to negotiate and approve new contracts in a timely manner?

467
00:49:56,913 --> 00:49:57,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that question.

468
00:49:58,033 --> 00:50:05,197
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to acknowledge that the teacher contracts that have come before me in my time, I think, is something that is a major point of contention, as you mentioned.

469
00:50:05,517 --> 00:50:16,221
[SPEAKER_09]: I think many members of the community who aren't as engaged in the educational platform that's going on in the community were really concerned with what we were doing and how we were impacting teachers, their families, and how that was, I think, impacting student learning.

470
00:50:17,562 --> 00:50:32,607
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what we are doing right now on this team that I've been interacting with the last two years is really working towards making sure that all staff members feel seen and heard during contract negotiations, are incorporating the questions and concerns from the unions and how that's impacting student learning.

471
00:50:33,148 --> 00:50:39,210
[SPEAKER_09]: I think when we understand about how to explain it, I think the budget is the biggest question.

472
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:52,874
[SPEAKER_09]: The budget that is teacher salaries and teacher benefits is one of the biggest components of the school budget, and understanding how every year when we have less and less of a school budget, it's going to impact teachers and contracts firstly.

473
00:50:53,294 --> 00:51:02,737
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just going to be student learning, but it's going to impact the people that are teaching the material and the curriculum that we want our students to learn every single year, I think it requires a robust

474
00:51:03,598 --> 00:51:12,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Contract negotiation team that are actively trying to understand better what types of things need to happen in the meetings, what types of things are changing at the state level, at the federal level.

475
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:18,379
[SPEAKER_09]: We're advocating for increased budgets every year that's going to properly pay and staff.

476
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:38,747
[SPEAKER_09]: are educators, but not just that, but I think also incorporating and creating an environment where teachers are excited to be here, they want to return, we want to make sure we have high teacher retention rates, and I think that comes in those negotiations where they feel seen and heard every single day when we have those communications about what types of things they're seeing in the classroom, because they're boots on the ground.

477
00:51:39,127 --> 00:51:41,028
[SPEAKER_09]: We as the professional staff,

478
00:51:42,189 --> 00:51:47,157
[SPEAKER_09]: in the school committee and on the contract negotiation team don't get to see what students are seeing and what teachers are seeing.

479
00:51:47,217 --> 00:51:51,083
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need to be able to incorporate what they're doing with what we are budgetarily restricted to.

480
00:51:51,924 --> 00:51:52,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

481
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:17,383
[SPEAKER_03]: What features would you like to see in a new building or in renovations to the existing building?

482
00:52:19,925 --> 00:52:21,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for that question.

483
00:52:21,826 --> 00:52:33,054
[SPEAKER_07]: It's no surprise that, to anyone when I talk about this, but I was a huge theater kid, and this was the theater, this was actually the stage that I found my voice on, which would lead me to be here today.

484
00:52:35,208 --> 00:52:48,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And obviously the stage is new and we have some new lighting, but in comparison to what every other theater production company that is at a building like this, it's abysmal.

485
00:52:48,712 --> 00:52:55,615
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's really sad because when we try to promote the arts and we try to help talk about all this, it's really bad.

486
00:52:56,735 --> 00:53:14,613
[SPEAKER_07]: Talking about the vocational school too, talking about the handshake between the high school and the vocational school, there's talks of having the Curtis Tufts on the same plot of land and that integration of students being with students and being all together and working together to better each other's lives.

487
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:25,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, you know, kind of piggybacking on the question of what other programs would you like to see, I think we need to have a bigger, I know we need to have a bigger emphasis on design.

488
00:53:25,624 --> 00:53:34,152
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a great graphic design program, but we have it where I feel as the community feels or some students maybe go into it where it's like, well, I just don't want to design posters all day.

489
00:53:34,953 --> 00:53:36,154
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not what graphic design is.

490
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,154
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing a wayfinding survey.

491
00:53:38,314 --> 00:53:40,155
[SPEAKER_07]: We're trying to figure out how to navigate the city.

492
00:53:40,495 --> 00:53:42,156
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine if we could do that in-house?

493
00:53:42,756 --> 00:53:46,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you imagine if we had a whole plot of artists, designers, graphic designers?

494
00:53:46,118 --> 00:53:47,919
[SPEAKER_07]: And we see that with the West Medford Open Studios.

495
00:53:47,959 --> 00:53:49,919
[SPEAKER_07]: We see how powerful art and design is in here.

496
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:54,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And our art studios and learning areas just aren't there yet.

497
00:53:55,322 --> 00:53:57,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would personally be advocating for more up-to-date.

498
00:53:58,423 --> 00:54:12,606
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, technology, up-to-date resources, so that way students that choose that path can feel empowered to do that, whether they wanted to go into engineering fields or industrial design fields like myself, architecture, graphic design, communication design, whatever have you, theater arts.

499
00:54:13,287 --> 00:54:16,507
[SPEAKER_07]: There are a lot of people, production companies, they're in demand.

500
00:54:17,068 --> 00:54:22,149
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's exactly what we have here today, how to use DMX, how to use sound, and that's what we need.

501
00:54:22,489 --> 00:54:22,809
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

502
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:23,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

503
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:26,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Jessica Parks.

504
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:54,665
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your approach to issues such as book challenges or policies concerning LGBTQ plus students?

505
00:54:58,728 --> 00:55:01,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you repeat that question?

506
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:11,037
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your approach to issues such as book challenges or policies concerning LGBTQ plus students?

507
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:26,477
[SPEAKER_02]: My approach to issues with book challenges would, I think, be communication with whoever is challenging them.

508
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:39,288
[SPEAKER_02]: It would reflect back to currently I think there is the Massachusetts state law and then also in action in Medford public schools.

509
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:54,980
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the ability for a parent to request that their child is exempt from certain area from a piece of curriculum due to religious

510
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:59,042
[SPEAKER_02]: exemption and so that they could sit out from that curriculum.

511
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:12,811
[SPEAKER_02]: And so but I think that court to that is just having a conversation and understanding truly what is at the core of that challenge and

512
00:56:14,045 --> 00:56:15,626
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, conversations.

513
00:56:15,947 --> 00:56:27,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I think conversations really help get at the essence of what is the challenge, what is, what a possible solution is, and, you know, is there a possible solution?

514
00:56:27,836 --> 00:56:28,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a way around this?

515
00:56:28,917 --> 00:56:35,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I do think that when there are challenges to materials that are taught in schools or children are,

516
00:56:37,404 --> 00:56:49,295
[SPEAKER_02]: kept from learning certain aspects of our curriculum, that not only does that child lose out, but the rest of the class loses out as well when the child does come back into the school.

517
00:56:51,377 --> 00:56:55,041
[SPEAKER_02]: The other part of the question was LGBTQ.

518
00:56:56,822 --> 00:57:15,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there was recently a policy passed, which I am in favor of, but I also think that we need to help change language surrounding our papers that go home.

519
00:57:16,993 --> 00:57:27,697
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, instead of saying daughter and son or he, she on permission slips, we need to start saying they, them and child.

520
00:57:29,038 --> 00:57:30,118
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think my time is up.

521
00:57:33,639 --> 00:57:34,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Jenny Graham.

522
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:40,162
[SPEAKER_12]: So many choices.

523
00:57:52,470 --> 00:58:01,684
[SPEAKER_03]: How will you ensure that students with special needs and IEPs, Individualized Educational Program, receive the support they need?

524
00:58:02,505 --> 00:58:06,531
[SPEAKER_03]: How will you balance this with the needs of the general student population?

525
00:58:09,409 --> 00:58:10,030
[SPEAKER_12]: It's interesting.

526
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:22,221
[SPEAKER_12]: I feel like in the last three or four weeks in particular, every outreach that I've gotten from a parent who says, can we have coffee, it's about somebody struggling with the IEP process.

527
00:58:23,503 --> 00:58:28,547
[SPEAKER_12]: My kids haven't had to go through the IEP process, but I have lots of friends who have.

528
00:58:28,808 --> 00:58:33,832
[SPEAKER_12]: And central to every conversation about an IEP is this idea that it's a fight.

529
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:42,521
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is just, it's truly heartbreaking to me that everyone with good intentions comes to the table to fight.

530
00:58:43,522 --> 00:58:56,654
[SPEAKER_12]: The district comes to fight, the parents come to fight, the advocates come to fight, the lawyers come to fight, and that serves nobody, and it particularly doesn't serve the child who should be in the middle of the conversation.

531
00:58:57,975 --> 00:59:14,083
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been thinking a lot about what happens in the next term via the strategic plan, and I fully expect that one of the things that we will see is that we desperately need to prioritize charting a better course around the creation of IEPs and 504s, and certainly

532
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:25,635
[SPEAKER_12]: Those documents are there to control cost as well as they are to help students.

533
00:59:26,476 --> 00:59:35,168
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think there are lots of ways forward that can be seeded more collaboratively and start helping students.

534
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:49,778
[SPEAKER_12]: For me, I think one of the things that I'm expecting to see as we go through the strategic plan is that we will hear voices loudly from our special education community telling us that we're not succeeding in that space.

535
00:59:50,038 --> 00:59:51,319
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would agree with them, we're not.

536
00:59:52,199 --> 00:59:57,363
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think really putting some priority and some emphasis around charting a better

537
00:59:57,963 --> 01:00:08,967
[SPEAKER_12]: more productive, more collaborative course forward will not only create a better relationship between home and school in those instances, but will actually also serve the kids.

538
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:10,848
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what we're here to do.

539
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:11,508
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

540
01:00:12,788 --> 01:00:13,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

541
01:00:14,729 --> 01:00:15,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Lisa Kingsley.

542
01:00:33,683 --> 01:00:38,115
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you engage parent populations that are traditionally hard to reach?

543
01:00:43,764 --> 01:00:50,430
[SPEAKER_00]: So parent engagement has to be a key focus for both the governance and management.

544
01:00:50,730 --> 01:01:01,099
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the school committee itself needs to prioritize parent engagement, and we need to hold our leadership at the district level, the superintendent and their team, accountable for the same thing.

545
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,661
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can't be a passive process.

546
01:01:04,042 --> 01:01:08,265
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot reach out once, send one survey, and if no one responds to it, say, okay.

547
01:01:09,086 --> 01:01:20,732
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really important that we seek out, we go to community spaces, we have multiple invitations, we ensure that translation is available, we have interpretation available.

548
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:26,555
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of strategies that we can use, but it all comes back to whether or not it's something we're prioritizing.

549
01:01:27,055 --> 01:01:37,578
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I wanted to continue this idea of making sure that we're engaging our community, particularly those that have not been successfully served, which we know are many of our families of students with disabilities.

550
01:01:38,298 --> 01:01:54,823
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was working in Malden, the school committee asked us to call every single family of a child on an IEP to check in to see how services happened during COVID and to see how they felt about it and whether or not compensatory services were needed.

551
01:01:55,483 --> 01:01:57,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that a laborious task?

552
01:01:57,564 --> 01:01:57,964
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

553
01:01:58,565 --> 01:01:59,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it a big undertaking?

554
01:02:00,205 --> 01:02:00,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

555
01:02:01,006 --> 01:02:22,617
[SPEAKER_00]: But that data caused us to shape what we were doing on the district level and helped us ensure that we were targeting our supports and using our resources to address where the deficits actually were, not based on one or two parents that reached out or our own personal experiences, but rather based on data that we strategically collected.

556
01:02:23,057 --> 01:02:32,103
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think ensuring that it's a priority is step one, and then the actual strategies that we use will be dependent on the goals of the purpose of the outreach.

557
01:02:32,924 --> 01:02:33,284
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

558
01:02:36,747 --> 01:02:37,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicole Branley.

559
01:02:37,908 --> 01:02:48,135
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope so.

560
01:02:57,692 --> 01:03:04,435
[SPEAKER_03]: How would you address, sorry, how would you address pushback from constituents who disagree with school policies?

561
01:03:10,678 --> 01:03:14,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, as a current school's commit, school committee member, I think we already do that.

562
01:03:17,101 --> 01:03:20,042
[SPEAKER_11]: We get a lot of feedback, I would say.

563
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:27,181
[SPEAKER_11]: from our constituents, lots of emails, lots of communication.

564
01:03:27,201 --> 01:03:36,145
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's really important to have discussions to explain where we come from as a committee, as a school, as a community.

565
01:03:37,565 --> 01:03:39,906
[SPEAKER_11]: We really need to support our families.

566
01:03:39,926 --> 01:03:48,510
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think every policy and every motion that we pass makes everybody happy all the time.

567
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:50,851
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we really need to find a middle ground

568
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:54,693
[SPEAKER_11]: to really support as many students as possible.

569
01:03:54,733 --> 01:03:56,935
[SPEAKER_11]: Because at the end of the day, this is what this is all about.

570
01:03:56,955 --> 01:03:59,216
[SPEAKER_11]: It's about the students, it's about the staff.

571
01:04:00,036 --> 01:04:00,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

572
01:04:02,938 --> 01:04:03,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Erika Reinfeldt.

573
01:04:24,455 --> 01:04:27,137
[SPEAKER_03]: This question relates to budgeting priorities.

574
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:33,740
[SPEAKER_03]: What personnel or programs need more funding, and how do you propose to achieve that?

575
01:04:34,821 --> 01:04:39,904
[SPEAKER_03]: When developing the school budget, name your top two priorities and explain why.

576
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,321
[SPEAKER_10]: That was a lot of words.

577
01:04:45,141 --> 01:04:45,461
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

578
01:04:45,621 --> 01:04:46,701
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a big question.

579
01:04:46,721 --> 01:05:02,947
[SPEAKER_10]: And I will note first that I think the budget process that we have is really important of talking to the departments, the department heads, the teachers, finding out what the people on the ground doing the work

580
01:05:03,602 --> 01:05:04,523
[SPEAKER_10]: think we need?

581
01:05:05,624 --> 01:05:06,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you repeat the question?

582
01:05:06,925 --> 01:05:07,865
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, there was a lot to it.

583
01:05:07,885 --> 01:05:08,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

584
01:05:08,766 --> 01:05:10,888
[SPEAKER_03]: This question relates to budgeting priorities.

585
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:16,392
[SPEAKER_03]: What personnel or programs need more funding, and how do you propose to achieve that?

586
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:22,777
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, when developing the school budget, name your top two priorities and explain why.

587
01:05:24,176 --> 01:05:24,516
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

588
01:05:25,538 --> 01:05:29,642
[SPEAKER_10]: So student support comes first for me.

589
01:05:29,762 --> 01:05:33,206
[SPEAKER_10]: What are these things that students need?

590
01:05:33,326 --> 01:05:37,211
[SPEAKER_10]: And are we getting it from federal and state sources?

591
01:05:37,671 --> 01:05:43,157
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they're not, we have to prioritize that because we know this is potentially coming under danger.

592
01:05:44,058 --> 01:05:50,919
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm always going to say that the arts needs more support, where people, this is a way for people to find their voice.

593
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:57,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm a STEM advocate as well, so I'm about to get out of my two priorities.

594
01:05:57,541 --> 01:06:06,623
[SPEAKER_10]: I would actually say that my top priority in budgeting is transparency and knowing where the funds are going, how it impacts students,

595
01:06:07,883 --> 01:06:18,306
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we've made a lot of progress over the last couple of years with new budget directors showing what we're actually spending on things so that we can make those decisions in a really informed way.

596
01:06:18,646 --> 01:06:35,750
[SPEAKER_10]: So accountability and transparency are my priorities, but in terms of what we're actually spending the money on, absolutely student supports and student options so that students have choices for career, for college, and can develop those skills that they really need to succeed.

597
01:06:39,192 --> 01:06:39,732
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

598
01:06:39,772 --> 01:06:41,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Paul Russo.

599
01:07:02,537 --> 01:07:14,804
[SPEAKER_03]: In the wake of school shootings and other violent incidents, what do we need to do physically through counseling or by monitoring social media to avoid having such incidents occur in Medford?

600
01:07:16,645 --> 01:07:17,626
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you repeat it one more time?

601
01:07:18,226 --> 01:07:31,534
[SPEAKER_03]: In the wake of school shootings and other violent incidents, what do we need to do physically through counseling or by monitoring social media to avoid having such incidents occur in Medford?

602
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:36,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for a very hard question.

603
01:07:37,461 --> 01:07:42,623
[SPEAKER_06]: If there was an easy answer, I'm pretty sure it would have been implemented somewhere in this country already.

604
01:07:44,423 --> 01:07:48,404
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that this is a topic that is

605
01:07:51,798 --> 01:07:54,100
[SPEAKER_06]: hard to have a conversation about.

606
01:07:55,280 --> 01:08:09,289
[SPEAKER_06]: As a parent of a student in this building, as a parent who during the Sandy Hook massacre, I had to drop my kindergartner off at the Missittook, then the Columbus.

607
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:14,213
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a very challenging time to drop your kindergartner off.

608
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:17,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I had to dig into

609
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:25,460
[SPEAKER_06]: that experience as a lot of parents have.

610
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:31,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I will say that I've kind of come full circle on school safety.

611
01:08:32,405 --> 01:08:35,047
[SPEAKER_06]: ALICE is a program, the active shooter drills.

612
01:08:36,027 --> 01:08:46,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually participating in an active shooter drill in Lexington with some school administration during the massacre in Florida.

613
01:08:47,275 --> 01:08:48,336
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget the name of the school.

614
01:08:49,076 --> 01:08:49,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

615
01:08:50,477 --> 01:08:51,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Parkland, excuse me.

616
01:08:52,558 --> 01:08:55,960
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we were in there, and our phones were off, and we had no idea.

617
01:08:56,280 --> 01:09:01,682
[SPEAKER_06]: And then when we came out to our cars, everybody's phones were blowing up about what had just happened.

618
01:09:02,282 --> 01:09:04,383
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will tell you that even having

619
01:09:06,004 --> 01:09:12,350
[SPEAKER_06]: just received that news, there is no universe where I would allow an Alice active shooter drills in our schools.

620
01:09:14,352 --> 01:09:25,503
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the most utterly traumatic thing I have experienced, and there were staff that were crying, and to me it was abusive, frankly.

621
01:09:25,523 --> 01:09:28,526
[SPEAKER_06]: I really, American Society of Pediatrics,

622
01:09:29,505 --> 01:09:35,247
[SPEAKER_06]: APA or whatever they call themselves, they also think that it's not acceptable.

623
01:09:35,447 --> 01:09:40,288
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a tough question that there's no short answer for.

624
01:09:40,528 --> 01:09:40,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

625
01:09:40,948 --> 01:09:41,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

626
01:09:49,891 --> 01:09:51,711
[SPEAKER_05]: That concludes the second round of questions.

627
01:09:52,191 --> 01:09:54,812
[SPEAKER_05]: We will now proceed to the third and final round.

628
01:09:58,355 --> 01:09:59,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael Mastrobianni.

629
01:10:12,772 --> 01:10:23,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Massachusetts voters recently approved a measure to eliminate MCAS as a graduation requirement, but to retain it to assess student achievement and identify schools needing support.

630
01:10:24,478 --> 01:10:32,022
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your perspective on the decline in MCAS scores post-COVID and the decision to eliminate it as a graduation requirement?

631
01:10:34,683 --> 01:10:35,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that question.

632
01:10:41,207 --> 01:10:46,920
[SPEAKER_08]: The way I feel about MCAS is colored largely by my conversations with our superintendent in Somerville, Dr. Ruben Carmona.

633
01:10:50,023 --> 01:10:53,684
[SPEAKER_08]: when I'm looking for information on something that's novel to me.

634
01:10:53,944 --> 01:10:55,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, my kids are seven and four.

635
01:10:55,185 --> 01:10:56,205
[SPEAKER_08]: I have not done MCAS yet.

636
01:10:57,665 --> 01:10:58,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I go to the experts.

637
01:10:58,866 --> 01:11:01,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Carmona, what's up with MCAS?

638
01:11:01,586 --> 01:11:02,387
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on with this?

639
01:11:03,187 --> 01:11:05,488
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's literally how I ask him, because that's how I am.

640
01:11:06,948 --> 01:11:16,191
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think having this data on school, this aggregate data on school and grade and teacher performance is part of

641
01:11:16,911 --> 01:11:19,072
[SPEAKER_08]: part of the puzzle of improving our schools, right?

642
01:11:19,713 --> 01:11:21,594
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the only thing.

643
01:11:24,295 --> 01:11:34,541
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to continue to focus on our kids, on their growth, on their engagement, on their opportunities, and on the total spectrum of what success looks like.

644
01:11:34,781 --> 01:11:37,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, success is not acing MCAS.

645
01:11:41,959 --> 01:11:42,680
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's how I feel.

646
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:48,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that MCAS is something that's absolutely necessary, but I think it is a valuable tool for educators.

647
01:11:49,103 --> 01:11:51,544
[SPEAKER_08]: So then what do we do?

648
01:11:52,004 --> 01:11:52,584
[SPEAKER_08]: What's a better world?

649
01:11:53,945 --> 01:11:55,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I'm not a curriculum expert.

650
01:11:55,846 --> 01:11:56,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a testing expert.

651
01:11:57,386 --> 01:12:06,391
[SPEAKER_08]: But for me, we want to use that information to make data-informed decisions, not to identify outliers and make extreme reactions to them.

652
01:12:06,751 --> 01:12:09,312
[SPEAKER_08]: We know generally where Medford schools are.

653
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:10,853
[SPEAKER_08]: We know generally

654
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:16,797
[SPEAKER_08]: what our opportunities are, I think the next step, we don't need MCAS to tell us that.

655
01:12:16,877 --> 01:12:22,061
[SPEAKER_08]: The next step for us is to define what we want our district to look like and make a set of plans to get there.

656
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:23,983
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what's important to me rather than MCAS.

657
01:12:44,573 --> 01:13:00,210
[SPEAKER_05]: What is your perspective on the possibility of federal budget allocation being subject to federal guidelines or curriculum and policy requirements, such as teaching the history of enslaved people, DEI policies, or the treatment of transgender students?

658
01:13:01,772 --> 01:13:02,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for that question.

659
01:13:04,377 --> 01:13:31,956
[SPEAKER_09]: I find that as a state and as a local city that has the possibility of having federal funding cut, that relies on federal funding for a variety of programs, I think it's representative of the fact that there is fear from the federal government that we are doing what's right, that they're attacking our state and they're attacking our students by trying to cut programming and to be as informed, holistic students and individuals in the general population.

660
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:38,594
[SPEAKER_09]: My biggest concern is that how does this reverberate to students who have the most need?

661
01:13:39,034 --> 01:13:48,141
[SPEAKER_09]: So low income, special needs students, English learners, other demographics that we here in Medford really prioritize and we want to keep in the district.

662
01:13:49,642 --> 01:14:05,327
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that there is a variety of concern, I think, from the constituents about how we're going to navigate this if we do have federal funding cut and how that additional need will become more apparent with less and less monies available to us.

663
01:14:06,247 --> 01:14:11,289
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk a lot about as long as we have strong educators and willing students, that's all we really need.

664
01:14:11,569 --> 01:14:13,289
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot more to it than just that.

665
01:14:13,329 --> 01:14:14,990
[SPEAKER_09]: The achievement gap becomes more apparent.

666
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:17,052
[SPEAKER_09]: The student success rates become more apparent.

667
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:18,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Graduation decline.

668
01:14:19,134 --> 01:14:20,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Testing scores, as we just mentioned.

669
01:14:21,736 --> 01:14:26,361
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't quite know what that may look like because right now it's theoretical.

670
01:14:26,821 --> 01:14:31,365
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know that I've been in Zoom meetings and I've interacted with people at the Statehouse.

671
01:14:31,986 --> 01:14:39,453
[SPEAKER_09]: They are actively already trying to navigate what this may look like if we do lose federal funding and even additional state funding.

672
01:14:40,714 --> 01:14:51,361
[SPEAKER_09]: the governor's office, the attorney general's office, I know state representatives I'm communicative with, I know local cities, superintendents are all trying to navigate what is next, even if it doesn't actually happen.

673
01:14:52,081 --> 01:14:55,603
[SPEAKER_09]: How do we incorporate proper educational practices with less and less money?

674
01:14:56,344 --> 01:15:01,667
[SPEAKER_09]: The biggest fear, of course, is that eventually when you're doing more with less, eventually it just becomes less.

675
01:15:02,147 --> 01:15:08,851
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's where we need to navigate how can we as constituents actually impact student learning if we don't have the financial

676
01:15:11,538 --> 01:15:14,160
[SPEAKER_09]: backing that we usually or more commonly have.

677
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:15,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

678
01:15:17,922 --> 01:15:23,025
[SPEAKER_05]: As indicated earlier, John Antofa had to leave due to a previous personal commitment.

679
01:15:24,165 --> 01:15:26,887
[SPEAKER_05]: We will then proceed now to Jessica Parks.

680
01:15:39,078 --> 01:15:44,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Will you support a debt exclusion tax override to build or renovate a new Medford High School?

681
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:46,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

682
01:15:58,184 --> 01:15:58,504
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

683
01:16:00,125 --> 01:16:01,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Next to Jenny Graham.

684
01:16:02,846 --> 01:16:04,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing else needed to be said.

685
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:06,107
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get out early this way.

686
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:09,420
[SPEAKER_12]: We're rounding the end, folks.

687
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:10,381
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for your patience.

688
01:16:26,773 --> 01:16:29,915
[SPEAKER_05]: After-school programs have been an ongoing challenge for Medford.

689
01:16:29,935 --> 01:16:34,979
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think that after-school programs are important, and how would you help address this challenge?

690
01:16:36,298 --> 01:16:37,058
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, they are.

691
01:16:37,078 --> 01:16:49,422
[SPEAKER_12]: I think for anybody here at this table who has children, they've been impacted by the lack of after-school care in Medford in some way, shape, or form.

692
01:16:50,383 --> 01:16:54,264
[SPEAKER_12]: For my family, the after-school program was

693
01:16:54,724 --> 01:16:57,665
[SPEAKER_12]: a secret when my kids were in elementary school and in kindergarten.

694
01:16:57,705 --> 01:17:00,727
[SPEAKER_12]: You had to know somebody to know it existed, and we did not.

695
01:17:01,907 --> 01:17:04,328
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've changed that, which is great.

696
01:17:05,128 --> 01:17:10,731
[SPEAKER_12]: But the demand far outpaces what we've been able to provide historically.

697
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:13,512
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've done a lot of things over the years to try to fix that.

698
01:17:14,552 --> 01:17:20,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Most recently, a group of parents approached me and said, can you help us?

699
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,516
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't keep doing this this way.

700
01:17:24,436 --> 01:17:37,426
[SPEAKER_12]: And I said, the superintendent has just unexpectedly taken this role and we need to give her like 35 seconds before we ask her to dive into this like pretty intractable problem.

701
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:43,631
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we did give her like more than 35 seconds but less than 35 days before I knocked on her door and said,

702
01:17:45,552 --> 01:17:48,213
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's a group of parents that would really like to talk about this.

703
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:54,716
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they have taken the time to have a different approach than most of the parents who have come to us and said this is just not acceptable.

704
01:17:55,536 --> 01:17:56,956
[SPEAKER_12]: And can we have a meeting?

705
01:17:57,637 --> 01:18:02,519
[SPEAKER_12]: And so to the people at the table here, Erica and Jessica were both at that meeting.

706
01:18:02,959 --> 01:18:08,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Jessica being one of the parents who charted a different conversation with us as a district.

707
01:18:09,641 --> 01:18:12,862
[SPEAKER_12]: Out of that came like some really important things.

708
01:18:13,163 --> 01:18:13,443
[SPEAKER_12]: One is

709
01:18:14,343 --> 01:18:34,850
[SPEAKER_12]: a huge increase in after school already, engagement with a consultant to fully meet our demand, and some work to really change the way we think about after school from a place to keep kids safe to a place that has a wide variety of academic offerings.

710
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:42,392
[SPEAKER_12]: All of that is like yet to come, but I'm so excited to finally see some traction and I just want to say thank you to the other people at this table

711
01:18:42,932 --> 01:18:45,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Erica and Jessica who have been on this journey with the after school task force.

712
01:18:46,156 --> 01:18:46,436
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

713
01:18:54,205 --> 01:18:54,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Lisa Kingsley.

714
01:19:11,315 --> 01:19:15,240
[SPEAKER_05]: What are your views on the district's current literacy or math programs?

715
01:19:16,101 --> 01:19:20,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there types of programs you would like to see put in place to provide more flexibility in instruction?

716
01:19:28,865 --> 01:19:32,226
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna answer the question, but in a fairly roundabout way.

717
01:19:32,746 --> 01:19:43,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So whenever we're thinking about a specific program or a curriculum, we're kind of farther down the line of decisions, and we're kind of beyond what the school committee itself has control over.

718
01:19:44,090 --> 01:19:46,750
[SPEAKER_00]: So the school committee sets our strategic direction.

719
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:58,194
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that we, I hope to do if I have the opportunity to serve on the school committee, is lean in to the beginning of a vision of effective instruction that has begun in Medford Public Schools.

720
01:19:58,674 --> 01:20:07,878
[SPEAKER_00]: We have started a vision for instruction and started an idea of what we think our position as a district, what we think good teaching and learning looks like.

721
01:20:08,598 --> 01:20:19,362
[SPEAKER_00]: Once that decision is made, then we can evaluate between research-backed, high-quality instructional materials to determine which one best fits our vision.

722
01:20:20,002 --> 01:20:24,503
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we know in education is there is not one good way to teach and learn.

723
01:20:24,883 --> 01:20:26,364
[SPEAKER_00]: What matters is coherence.

724
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:34,066
[SPEAKER_00]: It matters that we have taken a perspective as a district and made a decision about what we believe in Medford good teaching and learning looks like.

725
01:20:34,486 --> 01:20:37,667
[SPEAKER_00]: That comes from listening to all stakeholders involved.

726
01:20:38,027 --> 01:20:48,170
[SPEAKER_00]: And once that decision is made and once it's clear and actionable then we can assess our current reading program our math program and ensure that it fits.

727
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:51,911
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is not work that would be done in a year or two years.

728
01:20:52,291 --> 01:21:01,535
[SPEAKER_00]: The reading and math programs that we've adopted we are moving in the right track towards coherence and that every elementary school is using the same program for the first time.

729
01:21:01,595 --> 01:21:03,055
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a step in the right direction.

730
01:21:03,515 --> 01:21:16,780
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we work to codify what our vision of teaching and learning looks like we will then be in a better position to ensure that all of the different curricular components match the vision that we're seeking to achieve for our students.

731
01:21:22,909 --> 01:21:23,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Nicole Ranley.

732
01:21:49,450 --> 01:21:55,055
[SPEAKER_05]: What can be done about improving the nutritional value of food provided to our students?

733
01:21:57,498 --> 01:22:00,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you just read that one more time, because we've been talking about food this whole time, and I'm just laughing.

734
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:02,703
[SPEAKER_11]: That ended up being my question.

735
01:22:03,544 --> 01:22:09,129
[SPEAKER_05]: What can be done about improving the nutritional value of food provided to our students?

736
01:22:10,035 --> 01:22:15,876
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I have to give a big shout out to Retta Smith, who is our food director here at Memphis Public Schools.

737
01:22:16,956 --> 01:22:20,257
[SPEAKER_11]: She has really been a game changer.

738
01:22:20,737 --> 01:22:21,557
[SPEAKER_11]: She truly has been.

739
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:26,398
[SPEAKER_11]: I worked at the Brooks for six years, and I remember when Retta would come and bring samples.

740
01:22:26,958 --> 01:22:29,158
[SPEAKER_11]: The teachers were lining up for Retta's food.

741
01:22:30,459 --> 01:22:36,100
[SPEAKER_11]: She really has changed, I think, the face of Memphis Public Schools food.

742
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:48,365
[SPEAKER_11]: As a para, when I did lunch duty, I would always know when it was French toast stick day because it was a run on the cafeteria.

743
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:54,368
[SPEAKER_11]: I knew when other things were being served and everybody was kind of hanging out waiting for a slice of pizza.

744
01:22:55,188 --> 01:22:58,290
[SPEAKER_11]: So, nutrition and learning go hand in hand.

745
01:22:59,071 --> 01:23:07,017
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe healthy, appealing school meals are part of academic success, and that every student deserves access to them without a stigma.

746
01:23:07,797 --> 01:23:10,179
[SPEAKER_11]: A full belly is a full mind.

747
01:23:11,240 --> 01:23:15,323
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know even my high school student is eating school lunch every day.

748
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:18,626
[SPEAKER_11]: and always knows what he had for lunch.

749
01:23:19,146 --> 01:23:20,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, mom, we had this today.

750
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:20,627
[SPEAKER_11]: We had this.

751
01:23:21,008 --> 01:23:29,776
[SPEAKER_11]: And I feel like if it was just that, you know, pizza and Doritos or tater tots that I ate when I was here at Medford High, it probably wouldn't be discussed as much as it is at our own dinner table.

752
01:23:30,216 --> 01:23:32,438
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm really grateful for the strides that we've made.

753
01:23:32,458 --> 01:23:33,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

754
01:23:39,204 --> 01:23:40,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Erika Reinfeld.

755
01:24:03,222 --> 01:24:12,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Around the nation, parents and groups have expressed concern about certain books being available to their children or used as optional teaching materials.

756
01:24:13,233 --> 01:24:21,322
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there certain types of books or books with particular message or characters that we should restrict at any grade level?

757
01:24:23,986 --> 01:24:42,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it is hugely important that the materials we have in our classrooms be developmentally appropriate, and I think it's hugely important that they represent the community that we live in, the students who are in the classroom, and that they be educational tools that can facilitate learning and dialogue.

758
01:24:43,609 --> 01:24:47,152
[SPEAKER_10]: what we have to have is good conversations.

759
01:24:47,432 --> 01:24:49,474
[SPEAKER_10]: I think our learning materials have to reflect that.

760
01:24:49,814 --> 01:24:53,878
[SPEAKER_10]: They have to reflect the world that we live in, the world that students are entering into.

761
01:24:54,498 --> 01:25:04,787
[SPEAKER_10]: So yes, we need to be careful about what's in the schools, but not by way of censorship, by way of providing benefit and community to children.

762
01:25:11,092 --> 01:25:12,213
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, Paul Rousseau.

763
01:25:16,607 --> 01:25:16,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Which one?

764
01:25:17,687 --> 01:25:19,348
[SPEAKER_06]: We all want to know what the last question is.

765
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:23,410
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't want to answer another question.

766
01:25:23,430 --> 01:25:31,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll read it afterwards.

767
01:25:31,773 --> 01:25:32,233
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

768
01:25:39,296 --> 01:25:41,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford currently has an interim superintendent

769
01:25:42,315 --> 01:25:50,705
[SPEAKER_05]: What criteria and methods will you use to ensure that the best superintendent is selected from a broad range of internal and external candidates?

770
01:25:52,457 --> 01:25:55,499
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was the question we were wondering, is that gonna get asked or not?

771
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:04,545
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was on the superintendent search after our former superintendent, Mr. Belston retired after a very long career here.

772
01:26:05,405 --> 01:26:10,528
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was a very interesting process hiring a superintendent.

773
01:26:11,009 --> 01:26:20,435
[SPEAKER_06]: There were 28 applicants, and I think we had four, three or four, I'm looking to remember Vander Kloot

774
01:26:21,275 --> 01:26:26,739
[SPEAKER_06]: tell me, because I forget, but that we put forward to the full committee for consideration.

775
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:32,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And I felt we had a pretty good pool of candidates.

776
01:26:33,564 --> 01:26:38,587
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I will say that in these last eight years,

777
01:26:41,253 --> 01:26:45,978
[SPEAKER_06]: To be blunt, the pool of good candidates for superintendent has not grown.

778
01:26:46,058 --> 01:26:48,420
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it has dwindled dramatically.

779
01:26:49,861 --> 01:27:00,351
[SPEAKER_06]: It is every single year, multiple times a year, school committees are deciding that they will not accept any of the candidates they have and they're going to start the whole process over.

780
01:27:01,913 --> 01:27:14,946
[SPEAKER_06]: When I go to school committee conferences, which I have done every year since 2018, it is almost invariably the number one conversation being had by other school committee members.

781
01:27:15,707 --> 01:27:17,088
[SPEAKER_06]: We're hiring a superintendent.

782
01:27:17,168 --> 01:27:18,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, my God, this is so hard.

783
01:27:18,469 --> 01:27:21,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Or our superintendent isn't getting renewed.

784
01:27:22,193 --> 01:27:23,334
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know what we're going to do.

785
01:27:24,735 --> 01:27:34,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And our professional association is very clear that if you have a good superintendent, you need to hold on, because, frankly, there's not a lot of candidates.

786
01:27:34,481 --> 01:27:45,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a lot of people want to work 14 hours a day, six days, seven days a week, and run a business, if you will, of this size for the kind of pay that they get.

787
01:27:46,628 --> 01:27:49,530
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would say that what am I looking for?

788
01:27:49,710 --> 01:27:53,792
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking for a lot of what we have in our current superintendent and I'm out of time.

789
01:27:54,652 --> 01:27:54,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

790
01:27:58,454 --> 01:28:02,977
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time I would like to invite Lacey and Tapa to join us on stage.

791
01:28:05,742 --> 01:28:10,185
[SPEAKER_05]: And while we're waiting, I will read the question, which is one I wish had been asked.

792
01:28:10,686 --> 01:28:15,629
[SPEAKER_05]: How will you evaluate technology purchases to ensure they provide a strong return on investment?

793
01:28:16,409 --> 01:28:21,213
[SPEAKER_05]: How should the school committee ensure equity for students who might be unable to afford internet at home?

794
01:28:21,993 --> 01:28:25,175
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can all think about that and dream about it tonight.

795
01:28:43,009 --> 01:28:46,632
[SPEAKER_03]: This concludes the Q&A portion of tonight's forum.

796
01:28:47,612 --> 01:28:51,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Each candidate will now have two minutes to deliver their closing statement.

797
01:28:52,395 --> 01:28:58,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Please note that the order of speaking will be reversed with candidate Rousseau going first.

798
01:29:00,522 --> 01:29:05,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you and after all of that I wish I could write my closing remarks over.

799
01:29:07,447 --> 01:29:12,750
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways thank you again to everyone here tonight and to those watching now or later.

800
01:29:13,591 --> 01:29:19,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Forums like this are a reminder of how much our community cares about our schools our students and our shared future.

801
01:29:20,336 --> 01:29:24,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Serving in the school committee is more than attending meetings or casting votes.

802
01:29:24,759 --> 01:29:26,040
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about listening deeply.

803
01:29:27,252 --> 01:29:31,816
[SPEAKER_06]: asking hard questions and making decisions that reflect both our values and our realities.

804
01:29:32,796 --> 01:29:38,481
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about showing up for students, families, educators, and the broader community, even when the choices are difficult.

805
01:29:39,862 --> 01:29:44,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I bring nearly eight years of experience, a steady hand, and a clear sense of purpose.

806
01:29:45,026 --> 01:29:56,815
[SPEAKER_06]: I've helped guide Medford through major transitions from pandemic recovery to budget challenges to the launch of our new high school project, and I've done it with a focus on equity, transparency, and long-term thinking.

807
01:29:58,181 --> 01:30:05,032
[SPEAKER_06]: My lived experience shapes how I evaluate policies how I advocate for students and how I prioritize resources.

808
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:10,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe our schools must serve every child especially those who need us most.

809
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:18,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking ahead, I will continue fighting for a zero-carbon high school that reflects our values and prepares our students for the future.

810
01:30:18,823 --> 01:30:24,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll work to protect the programs and supports that make our schools strong, even if we face financial headwinds.

811
01:30:24,905 --> 01:30:36,049
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm proud that our budget now reflects how we actually spend our money, because that honesty allows us to be transparent with the public and strategic about where we go next.

812
01:30:37,830 --> 01:30:40,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford deserves leaders who are prepared, principled, and persistent.

813
01:30:41,916 --> 01:30:44,039
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope to continue being that kind of leader for you.

814
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:47,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your time, your trust, and your commitment to our schools.

815
01:30:51,931 --> 01:30:53,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Candidate Erica Reinfeldt.

816
01:30:54,203 --> 01:30:54,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

817
01:30:55,023 --> 01:30:59,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've covered a lot of ground tonight, and I'm sure it's given all of us a lot to think about.

818
01:30:59,445 --> 01:31:08,768
[SPEAKER_10]: The piece that I really take from all of this is that most of the things that we've talked about on this stage are not isolated issues.

819
01:31:09,288 --> 01:31:15,130
[SPEAKER_10]: They are very, very connected, and they can't be addressed by one person or one perspective alone.

820
01:31:15,990 --> 01:31:23,655
[SPEAKER_10]: I think leadership is about a shared vision, and it's about putting the right pieces in place so that the work can happen efficiently and effectively.

821
01:31:24,235 --> 01:31:31,119
[SPEAKER_10]: So my vision is a school system that works for all students, where educators are valued, and families' needs are being met.

822
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:44,068
[SPEAKER_10]: The pieces that I bring to that puzzle are a sincere desire to listen, a commitment to collaborate, and the ability to rise above the noise and identify the trends and patterns that will inform thoughtful, strategic action.

823
01:31:44,968 --> 01:31:50,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I am a mother and an educator, but the thing that I most want to bring to the school committee is community.

824
01:31:50,853 --> 01:31:57,399
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that we are all in this together, and that supporting every individual student is supporting all students.

825
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:03,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I've taught in classrooms, in out-of-school time programs, in museums, in community health centers.

826
01:32:03,824 --> 01:32:10,150
[SPEAKER_10]: I've run field trip programs, developed museum exhibitions, led teacher professional development, and conducted educational research.

827
01:32:10,690 --> 01:32:17,154
[SPEAKER_10]: My personal opinion is that Medford schools are moving in a good direction, but that there are still too many people falling through the cracks.

828
01:32:17,715 --> 01:32:19,856
[SPEAKER_10]: So, once again, I'm going to close with a promise.

829
01:32:20,416 --> 01:32:28,962
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to promise to keep showing up, to engage thoughtfully with the issues, and to keep communicating about where I stand, where I think we need to go, and how we can get there.

830
01:32:29,322 --> 01:32:32,724
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope everyone has a great night, and I'm really excited for the conversations to come.

831
01:32:38,776 --> 01:32:42,558
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you all for being here tonight, for watching and listening from home.

832
01:32:43,318 --> 01:32:47,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm grateful to the Medford Democratic City Committee for this opportunity.

833
01:32:48,061 --> 01:32:50,342
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank my fellow school committee colleagues.

834
01:32:51,402 --> 01:32:53,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Serving with you has been quite an honor.

835
01:32:53,383 --> 01:33:00,727
[SPEAKER_11]: And all of you running for office for the first time, as I know firsthand the guts, the time, and the commitment that this really takes.

836
01:33:01,727 --> 01:33:14,429
[SPEAKER_11]: I bring a unique aspect to the role of a school committee member, have been educated here, a lifelong member of our community, worked in our schools, being a parent of a current student and one who has graduated.

837
01:33:15,149 --> 01:33:18,110
[SPEAKER_11]: I work in public education every single day.

838
01:33:19,150 --> 01:33:30,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford runs deep within me, and I have been so grateful for the support of this city, for myself, for my family, and this truly feels, this position is an amazing way to give back.

839
01:33:31,192 --> 01:33:34,794
[SPEAKER_11]: I show up and I will continue to show up moving forward.

840
01:33:35,715 --> 01:33:40,458
[SPEAKER_11]: I vowed back in 2022 to do anything I could to step up for our children.

841
01:33:44,123 --> 01:33:46,805
[SPEAKER_11]: and our staff, and I have done just that.

842
01:33:47,545 --> 01:33:48,526
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a woman of my word.

843
01:33:48,546 --> 01:33:53,370
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a listening ear, and I believe that's truly what our public school system needs.

844
01:33:54,350 --> 01:33:59,794
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to work together as a community to ensure every child has the opportunity they deserve to thrive.

845
01:34:00,535 --> 01:34:07,440
[SPEAKER_11]: They need someone that is invested in Medford, who can work on issues affecting our city and its families and move us forward.

846
01:34:07,460 --> 01:34:11,542
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be a great honor to earn your vote, and not one that I have ever taken for granted.

847
01:34:11,943 --> 01:34:12,223
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

848
01:34:17,728 --> 01:34:18,469
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

849
01:34:19,169 --> 01:34:24,672
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you haven't noticed tonight, I'm somebody who really digs into data, but it's not for the sake of numbers.

850
01:34:24,872 --> 01:34:31,997
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because every piece of data tells a story about a student, a teacher, or a system that we can make even stronger.

851
01:34:32,737 --> 01:34:37,021
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at our current school committee data, it tells a story of opportunity.

852
01:34:37,562 --> 01:34:39,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Our school committee members have been working so hard.

853
01:34:39,864 --> 01:34:42,327
[SPEAKER_00]: There was 31 meetings that were held last year.

854
01:34:42,927 --> 01:34:50,114
[SPEAKER_00]: But the special education subcommittee, the superintendent evaluation subcommittee, and the curriculum assessment accountability didn't meet.

855
01:34:51,403 --> 01:34:58,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Across all of our school committee meetings from September to June student outcomes are indirectly mentioned on the agenda about 10 times.

856
01:34:58,685 --> 01:35:06,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm running to support progress to close these gaps and support the school committee moving forward with my deeply experienced lens.

857
01:35:06,787 --> 01:35:11,608
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to help us connect the promises that we make to students and the systems that must deliver on them.

858
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:20,530
[SPEAKER_00]: That starts with clarity and accountability using data to understand what's working naming where we need to improve and following through on our commitments.

859
01:35:21,110 --> 01:35:26,391
[SPEAKER_00]: It also means coherence, aligning our goals, budgets, and strategies so we're pulling in the same direction.

860
01:35:26,891 --> 01:35:31,032
[SPEAKER_00]: And it means trust, built through transparent communication and consistent action.

861
01:35:31,533 --> 01:35:33,973
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all levers that create lasting improvement.

862
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:49,757
[SPEAKER_00]: I bring the lived experience of a teacher and principal, the systems perspective of a district leader and Harvard-trained strategist, but the heart of a Medford parent who sees the incredible potential in our students and knows how to run or how to turn that potential into progress.

863
01:35:50,637 --> 01:36:01,520
[SPEAKER_00]: On doorsteps across the city, families name the same priorities, better after school access, clearer communication, supportive special education processes, and real enrichment for kids.

864
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:09,122
[SPEAKER_00]: But unless we name our goals, design a plan to reach them, and hold ourselves accountable, those needs remain dreams without follow through.

865
01:36:09,942 --> 01:36:18,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm ready to help us connect that vision to action with strategy data and collaboration so every child in Medford can learn, grow, and thrive.

866
01:36:18,265 --> 01:36:19,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

867
01:36:22,462 --> 01:36:23,943
[SPEAKER_03]: candidate Jenny Graham.

868
01:36:25,204 --> 01:36:25,584
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

869
01:36:26,685 --> 01:36:37,331
[SPEAKER_12]: As I was mentioning earlier, two hours ago, one of the things that we are working on as we move forward is a thoughtful strategic plan that starts with the community.

870
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:40,193
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll also be talking to you all

871
01:36:40,693 --> 01:36:54,645
[SPEAKER_12]: when we are talking about the future of this building and get ready and keep showing up because we need to hear from you and we want to hear from you through all of these processes because you will help inform this path forward.

872
01:36:56,327 --> 01:37:03,677
[SPEAKER_12]: The school committee is an important voice to make sure that the things that our community wants can be seen in our schools.

873
01:37:04,799 --> 01:37:10,487
[SPEAKER_12]: If you know me, you know that I believe that we can listen, be bold and move fast all at the same time.

874
01:37:11,128 --> 01:37:14,810
[SPEAKER_12]: It's possible and it's time for us to do that.

875
01:37:15,971 --> 01:37:29,699
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of momentum in our schools right now coming off a successful override, not having a bloodbath of a budget season, looking forward to a new high school, and I'm really proud of everything that we've accomplished.

876
01:37:30,659 --> 01:37:35,201
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited for what's ahead, and I would just welcome you if you have questions.

877
01:37:35,601 --> 01:37:42,244
[SPEAKER_12]: I can promise you that none of these topics were done service in two minutes, except maybe Jessica's question about the debt exclusion.

878
01:37:43,544 --> 01:37:51,668
[SPEAKER_12]: None of these topics are two-minute answers, and they probably also don't really meet you where you are with what those questions are.

879
01:37:52,628 --> 01:37:58,329
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have questions about any of these things, and you're like, gee, I wonder what Jenny thought of these questions, please call me.

880
01:37:58,889 --> 01:38:10,111
[SPEAKER_12]: If you have questions about meetings that we may or may not have had, choices we did or didn't make, or all of the things that go on behind the scenes that are the invisible work of the school committee, please reach out.

881
01:38:10,551 --> 01:38:11,592
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll meet you for coffee.

882
01:38:11,932 --> 01:38:13,952
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll head to the bistro for lunch or breakfast.

883
01:38:14,992 --> 01:38:18,093
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's going to be like my home for the foreseeable future.

884
01:38:18,133 --> 01:38:18,893
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'll see you there.

885
01:38:19,414 --> 01:38:26,013
[SPEAKER_12]: But let me know, I'm happy to talk at length about any of these topics because they all deserve, they deserve more than two minutes.

886
01:38:26,233 --> 01:38:26,715
[SPEAKER_12]: So, thank you.

887
01:38:29,664 --> 01:38:31,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Candidate Jessica Parks.

888
01:38:31,725 --> 01:38:32,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

889
01:38:33,365 --> 01:38:37,026
[SPEAKER_02]: The core of my campaign is truly meeting the needs of all learners.

890
01:38:37,706 --> 01:38:41,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I struggled as a student and was diagnosed with learning disabilities in high school.

891
01:38:42,388 --> 01:38:50,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen how confusing the IEP process can be through our former foster child and I have a kiddo who quickly finishes classwork to go on his Chromebook.

892
01:38:51,190 --> 01:38:56,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard from so many of you that I'm not alone in these experiences.

893
01:38:56,857 --> 01:39:07,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Every student, whether they struggle to access the curriculum, need alternative learning methods, or seek more challenges, deserves appropriate supports and opportunities to stay engaged in Medford's public schools.

894
01:39:08,008 --> 01:39:09,429
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of having to look elsewhere.

895
01:39:09,970 --> 01:39:24,439
[SPEAKER_02]: To make this happen, we must empower our educators, provide families with tools to advocate effectively and standardize procedures while measuring their success, because no child should fall through the cracks due to language barriers, financial limitations, or lack of information.

896
01:39:24,999 --> 01:39:30,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Every student deserves an IEP, not just as a label of remediation, but as a roadmap for growth.

897
01:39:31,223 --> 01:39:39,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Open, honest, consistent communication is essential to make well-informed decisions, but communication isn't only about sharing updates.

898
01:39:39,110 --> 01:39:43,914
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also about listening, building trust, and addressing issues before they escalate.

899
01:39:44,334 --> 01:39:56,044
[SPEAKER_02]: My experience communicating complex projects will be an asset here, and I will work to expand opportunities through office hours, regular coffee hours at the schools for educators, staff, and students, and one-on-one conversations.

900
01:39:57,025 --> 01:40:01,347
[SPEAKER_02]: In closing, and full disclosure, public speaking is not in my comfort zone.

901
01:40:01,987 --> 01:40:04,668
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's about doing the work, even when it's difficult.

902
01:40:04,948 --> 01:40:14,671
[SPEAKER_02]: And with me, you're voting for someone who will listen, and someone who will work to turn your issues into concrete plans and follow through, whether that is helping one student or the whole district.

903
01:40:15,251 --> 01:40:21,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you've heard, Medford needs a permanent superintendent and to create an updated strategic plan.

904
01:40:21,638 --> 01:40:28,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Who better to be on the team than a project manager with a track record of strategic solutions and bringing diverse voices to the table?

905
01:40:28,945 --> 01:40:37,454
[SPEAKER_02]: When you vote for me, you're choosing someone who will build systems that support educators and meet the needs of all learners, ensuring everyone is engaged, supported, and heard.

906
01:40:37,675 --> 01:40:37,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

907
01:40:43,687 --> 01:40:45,668
[SPEAKER_03]: with candidate John Intapa.

908
01:40:46,588 --> 01:40:52,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, my name is Lacey, and I'm John's sister, campaign treasurer, and MPS alumni.

909
01:40:52,770 --> 01:40:55,671
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to give his closing statement on his behalf.

910
01:40:56,971 --> 01:40:58,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize for leaving this amazing event.

911
01:40:58,832 --> 01:41:06,114
[SPEAKER_01]: I am currently on my way to Hartford, Connecticut, driving two of my incredible students to a conference for their continued professional development.

912
01:41:06,815 --> 01:41:10,536
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so gracious for their patience in assisting me in attending for most of tonight.

913
01:41:11,276 --> 01:41:18,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Working with higher education students on a daily basis is such a blessing, helping them grow as student leaders and members of the community.

914
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:22,222
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what I hope to assist in as a school committee member here in Medford.

915
01:41:22,582 --> 01:41:27,265
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why I love programs like the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility or the CCSR.

916
01:41:28,037 --> 01:41:29,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry for the tongue twister, Lacey.

917
01:41:29,437 --> 01:41:30,258
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, John.

918
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:37,259
[SPEAKER_01]: If I haven't made it clear enough tonight, one of my huge focus areas is the co-curricular experience.

919
01:41:37,999 --> 01:41:42,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Student success is the handshake between many things, but especially academics and extracurriculars.

920
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:46,561
[SPEAKER_01]: These extracurriculars are often the saving grace for our students.

921
01:41:47,201 --> 01:41:54,843
[SPEAKER_01]: All three of us in Taupo siblings have that to thank for our success in school, as all of us have been involved in the arts, athletics, and student government.

922
01:41:56,212 --> 01:41:59,733
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been such a wonderful journey so far, and I cannot thank you enough.

923
01:42:00,273 --> 01:42:02,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for helping fulfill a childhood dream of mine.

924
01:42:02,774 --> 01:42:09,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope to have impacted at least one student so far, just how I was by the school committee's support so many years ago.

925
01:42:10,415 --> 01:42:11,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to continue my work.

926
01:42:11,736 --> 01:42:15,097
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be an honor to have one of your six votes on November 4th.

927
01:42:15,357 --> 01:42:15,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

928
01:42:22,864 --> 01:42:25,388
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you everyone again for coming out and hearing us speak.

929
01:42:25,428 --> 01:42:28,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank you to my candidates as well for working with me.

930
01:42:29,073 --> 01:42:35,662
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been a really nerve-wracking, I think, night for all of us just because we're so excited about this work and we want to be the best we can be for each and every one of you.

931
01:42:36,887 --> 01:42:50,503
[SPEAKER_09]: Something I think I noticed that we all talked about was every student, every path, everyone, we all have informed consideration about what is best for this district and we all have to be involved on how to impact students to the best of their abilities.

932
01:42:51,784 --> 01:42:53,366
[SPEAKER_09]: When I'm talking about a vision for Medford,

933
01:42:53,646 --> 01:43:03,552
[SPEAKER_09]: where every young person, no matter their background, learning style, or circumstance, has access to an education that is consistent with what they need best, not a one-size-fits-all education.

934
01:43:04,412 --> 01:43:08,334
[SPEAKER_09]: It should prepare them not only for graduation, but life after graduation.

935
01:43:08,794 --> 01:43:14,518
[SPEAKER_09]: That means celebrating all pathways, college, career, trades, and community service alike.

936
01:43:15,378 --> 01:43:20,820
[SPEAKER_09]: As a current member of the school committee, I've seen firsthand how much progress we've made and how much more work remains.

937
01:43:21,380 --> 01:43:28,683
[SPEAKER_09]: From building stronger academic supports to playing for a new Medford High, our momentum depends on experience and collaboration within the team.

938
01:43:29,263 --> 01:43:31,204
[SPEAKER_09]: The work of governing isn't just theoretical.

939
01:43:31,524 --> 01:43:34,065
[SPEAKER_09]: It's practical, detailed, and deeply human.

940
01:43:34,785 --> 01:43:45,111
[SPEAKER_09]: It requires someone who knows how to navigate different cultural understandings, policies, partnerships, and relationships while keeping students' voices and student understanding at the center of every decision.

941
01:43:46,231 --> 01:43:54,656
[SPEAKER_09]: But it also requires lived experience, someone who understands what it means to come up through our schools to face inequities and to turn those lessons into advocacy.

942
01:43:55,562 --> 01:44:00,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I bring that perspective every day, being a representative of a growing population of diverse students and student learners.

943
01:44:01,366 --> 01:44:07,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Our schools are changing, our city is growing, and we need leadership that reflects in response to the full diversity of our community.

944
01:44:08,029 --> 01:44:12,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Something I learned during my gap year when I worked for City Year Boston is the spirit of Ubuntu.

945
01:44:12,851 --> 01:44:14,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I am because we are.

946
01:44:14,852 --> 01:44:20,854
[SPEAKER_09]: When we embrace Ubuntu, we recognize that every child's success is tied to our shared responsibility and collective strength.

947
01:44:21,414 --> 01:44:25,736
[SPEAKER_09]: Together, we can remind our kids that they are not an afterthought, but the heartbeat of Medford's future.

948
01:44:26,136 --> 01:44:36,580
[SPEAKER_09]: So tonight, I'm asking for your support, not just to continue serving, but to keep building a Medford that lives up to its promise, where every student has every opportunity, every path, for everyone.

949
01:44:36,940 --> 01:44:37,220
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

950
01:44:43,930 --> 01:44:44,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

951
01:44:45,550 --> 01:44:47,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight's conversation has been really great.

952
01:44:47,631 --> 01:44:49,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for teaching me a lot of things, folks.

953
01:44:49,391 --> 01:44:51,272
[SPEAKER_08]: You're all amazing candidates.

954
01:44:51,392 --> 01:44:56,653
[SPEAKER_08]: It's clear that everybody here on stage, and you all for sticking with us, you care deeply about the schools.

955
01:44:56,673 --> 01:44:57,633
[SPEAKER_08]: You care deeply about Medford.

956
01:44:58,073 --> 01:44:58,573
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

957
01:44:59,013 --> 01:45:05,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that really resonated with me tonight, a little bit of anxiety, a little bit of concern.

958
01:45:05,675 --> 01:45:06,775
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the feds going to do to us?

959
01:45:06,835 --> 01:45:08,395
[SPEAKER_08]: What does Proposition 2.5 mean for us?

960
01:45:08,495 --> 01:45:10,056
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we find the resources?

961
01:45:11,071 --> 01:45:14,094
[SPEAKER_08]: to keep the promise that we have to keep to our kids.

962
01:45:14,114 --> 01:45:16,376
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not here to advocate for themselves.

963
01:45:16,416 --> 01:45:17,457
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we're all here to do.

964
01:45:18,838 --> 01:45:19,599
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking ahead.

965
01:45:19,679 --> 01:45:26,425
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not sure what, you know, the word of the year is uncertainty, uncertain economy, uncertain federal environment, uncertain state environment.

966
01:45:30,248 --> 01:45:33,952
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm certain about, in this beautiful blue light that I look great in,

967
01:45:37,376 --> 01:45:39,599
[SPEAKER_08]: is that we don't have to do more with less.

968
01:45:40,941 --> 01:45:43,424
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to make these hard choices with clear eyes.

969
01:45:43,785 --> 01:45:45,787
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to discuss with the community what's important to them.

970
01:45:46,969 --> 01:45:49,172
[SPEAKER_08]: And we need to choose those priorities and execute them.

971
01:45:49,933 --> 01:45:54,939
[SPEAKER_08]: When I think about the committee, what I bring to the committee, years of managing public budgets.

972
01:45:55,860 --> 01:46:00,865
[SPEAKER_08]: turning community goals, concepts, ideas into real funded plans.

973
01:46:01,745 --> 01:46:03,107
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I do every day.

974
01:46:03,747 --> 01:46:09,152
[SPEAKER_08]: We need school committee members who can both champion our public schools, be cheerleaders and deliver results.

975
01:46:09,172 --> 01:46:09,992
[SPEAKER_08]: What does that mean?

976
01:46:10,012 --> 01:46:15,257
[SPEAKER_08]: That means steady, transparent leadership guided by best practices, not chasing whatever's new.

977
01:46:16,918 --> 01:46:18,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm running because I wanna support our schools.

978
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:19,781
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna support my kids.

979
01:46:19,801 --> 01:46:20,661
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna support your kids.

980
01:46:20,681 --> 01:46:21,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna support our neighbors' kids.

981
01:46:21,822 --> 01:46:22,903
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanna support our teachers.

982
01:46:24,135 --> 01:46:28,978
[SPEAKER_08]: core to the responsibility of a local government is educating our kids.

983
01:46:31,880 --> 01:46:38,044
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to ensure that we're communicating clearly with our constituents, with our families.

984
01:46:38,064 --> 01:46:40,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to make sure that we're budgeting soundly.

985
01:46:41,126 --> 01:46:45,629
[SPEAKER_08]: And I want to make sure that every decision we make as a school committee strengthens the most important responsibility we have.

986
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:49,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to MDCC for hosting this conversation.

987
01:46:49,352 --> 01:46:52,594
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I speak for everyone and to everyone who took the time to hang out with us tonight.

988
01:46:52,734 --> 01:47:00,799
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm proud to be a parent and a public servant in this community and Medford deserves a school community that's focused, informed, grounded in values and a vision for the district.

989
01:47:00,819 --> 01:47:06,202
[SPEAKER_08]: We need a team that can plan for the future while protecting and enhancing what makes our school special today.

990
01:47:11,738 --> 01:47:16,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to all the candidates and thank you to the Medford Public Schools for allowing us the use of the auditorium.

991
01:47:17,541 --> 01:47:26,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Also to the volunteers from Tufts and from Medford High and finally the staff here who helped us this evening to set up the stage, get everything ready.

992
01:47:26,567 --> 01:47:27,948
[SPEAKER_05]: We truly appreciate your help.

993
01:47:28,788 --> 01:47:31,270
[SPEAKER_05]: That concludes tonight's School Committee Candidate Forum.

994
01:47:31,890 --> 01:47:38,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Please note that the Medford Democratic City Committee will hold a forum for City Council candidates next Thursday at 7 p.m.

995
01:47:38,914 --> 01:47:39,955
[SPEAKER_05]: here in the Caron Theater.

996
01:47:40,495 --> 01:47:44,183
[SPEAKER_05]: and it will be broadcast, streamed, and recorded by Medford Public Media.

997
01:47:45,025 --> 01:47:47,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for attending and viewing this forum.

998
01:47:47,730 --> 01:47:48,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good night.
