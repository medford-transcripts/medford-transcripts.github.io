00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:23,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a reminder for folks watching at home.

11
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:28,852
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a meeting last night where we did an overview of the budget talked about the

12
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:44,014
[SPEAKER_08]: current projection that the requests from our departments are about a million dollars more than the expected revenue for the city, and that the administration is still working to bring the spending in line with expected revenue, because we are required to have a balanced budget.

13
00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:45,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is the job.

14
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:51,722
[SPEAKER_08]: They're also looking at, hopefully, maybe the revenue side may be going up a little bit, but we don't know.

15
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:53,923
[SPEAKER_08]: right now.

16
00:07:54,404 --> 00:07:58,087
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have four departments with us tonight.

17
00:07:59,668 --> 00:08:07,194
[SPEAKER_08]: And this we're going to also have additional preliminary budget meetings on May 6th, May 20th and May 21st.

18
00:08:07,214 --> 00:08:15,821
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll hear from the rest of our city department heads before we get a submission from the mayor at the end of the month of the fiscal year 2026 budget.

19
00:08:16,822 --> 00:08:19,044
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that, we will start with collector treasure.

20
00:08:19,284 --> 00:08:19,905
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have

21
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:21,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Judy with us.

22
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:24,755
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can.

23
00:08:26,936 --> 00:08:39,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just read off really quickly and then recognize you to, you know, give any narrative that you want to give about your department, about the changes in the budget and your, you know, what's happened this year plans for next year, whatever you'd like to do.

24
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:45,084
[SPEAKER_08]: But first I'll just say that the fiscal year 25 budget, that's the current year, was $757,494.

25
00:08:45,865 --> 00:08:46,445
[SPEAKER_08]: That's increasing to $780,059.

26
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:49,168
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's an increase both in the personnel expenses and the ordinary expenses.

27
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:50,068
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a total increase of $22,565.

28
00:08:50,108 --> 00:08:52,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is happening mostly in the fixed cost growth

29
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:16,234
[SPEAKER_08]: area where we have contractual raises and step increases in the COLA for staff.

30
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:23,000
[SPEAKER_08]: And there was a data processing contract increase, the payroll cost increase as well.

31
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,483
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the vast majority of that increase there.

32
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:36,472
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there's also one new expense, which is increase needed to attend Mass Collector Treasurer Association classes and conference for recertification.

33
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,891
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that, I will turn it over to the Collective Transfer.

34
00:09:43,972 --> 00:09:44,613
[SPEAKER_08]: We can hear you now.

35
00:09:45,553 --> 00:09:47,115
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, thank you.

36
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:52,739
[SPEAKER_07]: The increase in the cost is for the city and the school payroll that comes out of my budget.

37
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,841
[SPEAKER_07]: So just that's why the $11,000 is.

38
00:09:55,101 --> 00:10:04,949
[SPEAKER_07]: And the increase in the CHS for the online payments, that is for, we collect the real estate, personal property, water,

39
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,311
[SPEAKER_07]: that's what we need a little increase in that.

40
00:10:07,331 --> 00:10:11,073
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, excise and now they're doing the citizens served for the building permits.

41
00:10:11,113 --> 00:10:14,236
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of those that come through, and now we've added city clerk.

42
00:10:14,816 --> 00:10:16,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Health department zoning.

43
00:10:16,377 --> 00:10:21,521
[SPEAKER_07]: All those permits and licenses are all coming through that, and it's a charge of 25 cents per

44
00:10:28,225 --> 00:10:33,729
[SPEAKER_07]: The new expense is just an increase to our dues and conferences.

45
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:42,657
[SPEAKER_07]: That is so that the treasurer and the assistant, we're both certified that we can recertify so that we have to attend classes in the conference.

46
00:10:45,439 --> 00:10:50,603
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the other the payrolls are just the regular contractual raises.

47
00:10:50,623 --> 00:10:51,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

48
00:10:52,791 --> 00:11:11,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there anything else any highlights of the year you'd like to share any plans for the upcoming year for your highlights know we're waiting on the, we have our tax title attorneys waiting for the new laws that went in for the tax titles, we have held off on doing our tax titles because of the.

49
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:22,855
[SPEAKER_07]: We're hoping that the state will change a few pieces of the law so that right now it's going to be it goes from 16% interest to 8% interest.

50
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:24,836
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we leave it in collections, it's 14%.

51
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:36,020
[SPEAKER_07]: So most cities and towns are not putting their taxes into tax titles, they're just leaving them in collections till we find out more on this law how it's going to work.

52
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:44,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, any questions from members of the council on the collector treasurer budget that we have in front of us?

53
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:53,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, are there any questions from members of the public on the collector treasurer?

54
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:56,760
[SPEAKER_08]: You can raise your hand on Zoom or approach the podium.

55
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:05,025
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, thank you for being here.

56
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:05,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

57
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:07,172
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, wait, sorry, I have a question.

58
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:07,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, a question, okay.

59
00:12:08,112 --> 00:12:09,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Ah, Vice President Collins.

60
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:10,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, it's not a question.

61
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:13,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to say thank you for kicking off the departmental budget.

62
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,914
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my gosh, two and a half hours of zoning.

63
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:21,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for kicking off our budget hearings and thank you for presenting your budget to us tonight.

64
00:12:22,035 --> 00:12:22,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Really appreciate it.

65
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:23,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for your time.

66
00:12:23,335 --> 00:12:23,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

67
00:12:27,656 --> 00:12:27,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

68
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:34,637
[SPEAKER_08]: Next, we will go to our Medford Community Meeting, I believe.

69
00:12:35,862 --> 00:12:37,623
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, Medford Community Media.

70
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:43,426
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have Kevin with us.

71
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:57,914
[SPEAKER_08]: And as folks know, Medford Community Media produces, it's our public access station here in the city.

72
00:12:59,275 --> 00:13:00,815
[SPEAKER_08]: The budget last year, fiscal 25 was

73
00:13:02,868 --> 00:13:08,833
[SPEAKER_08]: $208,424.

74
00:13:03,028 --> 00:13:08,833
[SPEAKER_08]: The proposed budget is $215,061, an increase of $6,600.

75
00:13:09,493 --> 00:13:26,085
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is almost all going into the step raises and COLA increases for staff and a little bit of cable license negotiations, which is both under the fixed cost growth.

76
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:28,407
[SPEAKER_08]: These are costs just to keep doing what we've been doing.

77
00:13:28,827 --> 00:13:29,608
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that,

78
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:38,085
[SPEAKER_08]: And Kevin, tell us if you'd like to share anything more, and then if there's any highlights from the year, any plans for next year, and then we'll go to questions from the council.

79
00:13:39,326 --> 00:13:39,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

80
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:43,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to start with the invention of television.

81
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:47,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wanted to keep it light.

82
00:13:47,931 --> 00:13:48,791
[SPEAKER_04]: We did that last year.

83
00:13:49,112 --> 00:13:49,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

84
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:51,093
[SPEAKER_04]: We did.

85
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:55,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I do want to begin, reintroduce myself.

86
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:59,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin Harrington, station manager for Medford Community Media.

87
00:14:00,761 --> 00:14:17,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to, first of all, thank all of our staff and volunteers throughout this past fiscal year, especially Shane, who's in the booth, so that I don't have to be doing some sitcom-level thing, presenting the budget and switching cameras at the same time.

88
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:27,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Cat Darnell, who was our production coordinator, but then has moved to a position with the schools and helps out with our school committee booth coverage.

89
00:14:28,372 --> 00:14:33,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Wanted to thank Sarah Pendenza, she was our production coordinator for much of this fiscal year.

90
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:40,175
[SPEAKER_04]: She's since moved on from Metro Community Media, but we wish her the best and we will miss her dearly.

91
00:14:40,615 --> 00:14:46,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Wanted to thank Mark Davidson, who worked, thanks to Pam Kelly, through the tax abatement program.

92
00:14:47,217 --> 00:14:49,118
[SPEAKER_04]: He was really valuable and helpful this year.

93
00:14:49,798 --> 00:14:54,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Steve Bertorelli, Lenny Scaletta, who are both members and volunteers.

94
00:14:54,979 --> 00:15:01,905
[SPEAKER_04]: and wanted to thank our MVTHS co-ops, Jonathan Malerba, as well as Asnee and Barry.

95
00:15:02,766 --> 00:15:04,347
[SPEAKER_04]: They've both been really tremendous this year.

96
00:15:04,547 --> 00:15:16,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And to thank all of our members for coming to the studio, making their programming, watching us on the city meetings, watching our live streams.

97
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:20,981
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, we do this for the members of the public.

98
00:15:23,272 --> 00:15:28,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I want to also give a quick shout out to just the other city departments in general.

99
00:15:29,422 --> 00:15:33,227
[SPEAKER_04]: I've worked with many of them especially rich lane from it.

100
00:15:33,608 --> 00:15:34,970
[SPEAKER_04]: Francis was a from.

101
00:15:36,842 --> 00:15:47,170
[SPEAKER_04]: from DEI, she was really helpful with Rich in putting together our assisted listening upgrade in addition to all the other audio upgrades we had here in the chambers.

102
00:15:47,730 --> 00:16:03,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Wanted to thank, additionally, Rich again, and also Councilor Bears was really helpful with the audio upgrade program, helping me learn how to speak, you know, Bid, which is, you know, not really my forte.

103
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:14,283
[SPEAKER_04]: And then of course, HR, purchasing, finance, all the important departments that help me out with all these kinds of things that I'm very much a newbie about.

104
00:16:14,643 --> 00:16:21,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Wanted to give them all kind of a shout out as well as just the city in general and how everyone's been able to work together.

105
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:26,486
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I work with a lot of the departments, whether it's broadcasting events, that kind of a thing.

106
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:33,028
[SPEAKER_04]: But to get down to brass tacks and to move things along, you mentioned really the only adjustments

107
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:39,297
[SPEAKER_04]: are the COLA increase for personnel.

108
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,558
[SPEAKER_04]: We also decrease the part-time amount by 1,000.

109
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:58,285
[SPEAKER_04]: We had previously had 1,000 added into that number for a stipend pool to try to cover city hall meetings, and that ended up kind of not really able to work out, so we were able to kind of cut that.

110
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:03,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, yeah, the line item for the legal fees related to cable license renegotiation.

111
00:17:05,495 --> 00:17:10,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, yeah, that's, I mean, you pretty much already covered it.

112
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:15,060
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to look at the budget one more time, see if there's anything I need to point out.

113
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:21,062
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that about does it.

114
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:24,564
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

115
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:26,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any questions for Kevin?

116
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:30,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Luzardo?

117
00:17:33,337 --> 00:17:34,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, no questions.

118
00:17:34,258 --> 00:17:35,719
[SPEAKER_03]: Very reasonable increases.

119
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:39,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here, and I appreciate your rundown of your department.

120
00:17:41,542 --> 00:17:41,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

121
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:42,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

122
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:44,264
[SPEAKER_08]: So see no questions from Mr. Council.

123
00:17:44,824 --> 00:17:51,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a couple brief the negotiation of the license.

124
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:54,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that is how we get our peg fees.

125
00:17:55,931 --> 00:17:57,692
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess I'm just wondering

126
00:17:59,148 --> 00:18:03,250
[SPEAKER_08]: I see that there was some actual money spent this year that wasn't budgeted for.

127
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,451
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just wondering how that process goes and what can we expect?

128
00:18:07,511 --> 00:18:09,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we going to maintain the PEG fee?

129
00:18:10,912 --> 00:18:13,653
[SPEAKER_08]: That negotiation only happens once every so often.

130
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:17,075
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just kind of, I think this might be the first time we've done it since I've been on the council.

131
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,075
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you can go into it a little bit.

132
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:18,855
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

133
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:22,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is my first time around with this kind of thing as well.

134
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:38,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Having only worked with lawyers in a video production capacity I will disclaim that I'm not a lawyer so I don't know how much we are aren't supposed to talk about it but what I do feel comfortable sharing is, you know, the, we have.

135
00:18:40,841 --> 00:18:44,664
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we have a team with KB Law who's been working on it with us.

136
00:18:45,885 --> 00:18:48,026
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of taking point at the moment.

137
00:18:49,347 --> 00:18:50,768
[SPEAKER_04]: We had some preliminary meetings.

138
00:18:50,808 --> 00:19:02,637
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a public hearing this past fall, which is one of the things we're required to do as part of the process where we talk to the public about, you know, what we're kind of aiming to do.

139
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:12,638
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, I mean, our hope is to maintain, at the very least, I would think, maintain our current amount of fees in terms of percentages.

140
00:19:12,658 --> 00:19:22,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, try to see if we can also, you know, make sure that we have a good, you know,

141
00:19:24,243 --> 00:19:27,364
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like I said, keep a good foundation for the years to come.

142
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:42,548
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's all sorts of possible capital expenditures that we could be looking at that we want to plan ahead for like the big, the big one is, if there's a new high school, we are currently on high school grounds.

143
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:52,397
[SPEAKER_04]: If there is a change to that building, we're going to have to do something about it, we're going to have to relocate temporary location installed a new location.

144
00:19:52,477 --> 00:20:02,767
[SPEAKER_04]: So, those would be the kind of things that we're trying to look, look ahead to as part of that process because a big part of the negotiation process for me so far has been.

145
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:05,989
[SPEAKER_04]: to try to predict the next 10 years or so.

146
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,252
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the things, what are the big ticket items we might have to do?

147
00:20:09,772 --> 00:20:16,938
[SPEAKER_04]: What are gonna be our possible personnel costs and that kind of thing?

148
00:20:18,499 --> 00:20:20,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that about covers it.

149
00:20:21,661 --> 00:20:22,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thanks, yeah.

150
00:20:23,563 --> 00:20:27,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure KP's on top of this, but just throw my two cents in at least on,

151
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:35,550
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we know that cord cutting is happening and if we maintain the percentage of minutes to maintain the money because of the drop.

152
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,233
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know what leverage and leeway is available in the law.

153
00:20:39,273 --> 00:20:43,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure it's all state law and regulation, but, you know, creative ways to think about

154
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:56,551
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, maybe people who just are internet subscribers contributing, even if they're not cable, you know, we have so much, we do so much streaming, we have the, you know, system video on demand system.

155
00:20:56,631 --> 00:21:12,155
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know if that's allowable or whatever, or if they'd ever accept it as part of it, but, you know, certainly I hope, if not, that we can at least send the message that the law needs to catch up with the times a little bit on this, because I don't think we want,

156
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:19,547
[SPEAKER_08]: we can't afford to not have public access and provide such a valuable service to the community.

157
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:20,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

158
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:37,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think too, like one of the things that, you know, having only one full timer at the moment being me, you know, we've already been pretty creative, you know, having the co-ops, having the tax abatement employee as ways to expand our personnel within our means.

159
00:21:38,218 --> 00:21:41,140
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, at a certain point to be able to really provide, I think,

160
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:47,642
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, to be able to grow and expand, you know, and to serve the community even more than we already are.

161
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:53,745
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're gonna have to find a way to get some more folks in the door, but that's kind of a marathon, not a sprint, as it were.

162
00:21:54,745 --> 00:22:00,207
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I will mention is that I haven't checked in on it for a while, but I know many other, there's some,

163
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:11,103
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple of bills I believe that are meant to include streaming subscriptions into PEG fees.

164
00:22:12,804 --> 00:22:24,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not like part of any of that advocacy, so I don't really have a huge depth of knowledge as to like the process of it so far, but I know that that's been something that's been in progress for a little while.

165
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:30,631
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm sure if that becomes a law in the next whoever, who knows how many years,

166
00:22:31,331 --> 00:22:34,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that would be that would be a good step in the right direction.

167
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:38,094
[SPEAKER_04]: I think to kind of counterbalance the core cutting aspect.

168
00:22:38,635 --> 00:22:38,915
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

169
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:50,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah, and if you do hear any more about that from your colleagues in public access and there's value to this council, you know, maybe considering a resolution to ask the state legislature to act.

170
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,522
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure we members would consider it.

171
00:22:55,248 --> 00:23:04,471
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing I just noticed that your equipment other budget has some room left in it and sort of if you're gonna put some POs in before the end of the year.

172
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:12,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we got a couple big ones on the way for sure.

173
00:23:12,464 --> 00:23:14,245
[SPEAKER_04]: I was in the middle of working on one in the back room.

174
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:21,888
[SPEAKER_04]: I think just the way that the year shook out, we were definitely doing more smaller ones at the beginning of the year.

175
00:23:21,948 --> 00:23:25,550
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I like to make sure that I'm not in a mad scramble.

176
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:25,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I know

177
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:32,215
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably owe Darlene Luke a couple gift baskets if I go a little too crazy with that.

178
00:23:32,855 --> 00:23:34,376
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, great.

179
00:23:34,456 --> 00:23:34,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

180
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:38,159
[SPEAKER_08]: I see no further questions from members of the Council.

181
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:42,803
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any questions from members of the public, either in person or on Zoom, about Metro Community Media?

182
00:23:46,586 --> 00:23:47,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, thank you very much.

183
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:48,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

184
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:49,208
[SPEAKER_09]: Appreciate it.

185
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:50,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, everybody.

186
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:07,197
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we're gonna do parking.

187
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:07,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome.

188
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:09,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, hello.

189
00:24:10,299 --> 00:24:11,821
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just gonna read really quickly.

190
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:12,981
[SPEAKER_08]: We had our fiscal 25 budget, $951,741.

191
00:24:13,021 --> 00:24:13,702
[SPEAKER_08]: The fiscal 26 proposed $1,074,840.

192
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:15,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was an increase of $123,099.

193
00:24:28,187 --> 00:24:32,695
[SPEAKER_08]: And it looks like most of that 102,000 is in personnel.

194
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:33,536
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we had also a 19,000

195
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:54,490
[SPEAKER_08]: increase in the amended contract for the pay by phone, license plate recognition technology, increasing contracted monthly fees, increased enforcement activity, and that was all in the fixed cost growth bucket.

196
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

197
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:55,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

198
00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:00,972
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that, if you want to tell us, talk a little bit more about the budget, tell us

199
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:07,887
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, accomplishments in the last year, you know, I know you're new in the last year, but sure.

200
00:25:08,488 --> 00:25:09,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And what you're hoping for the next year.

201
00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:11,175
[SPEAKER_01]: So okay.

202
00:25:11,195 --> 00:25:11,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

203
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:33,106
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of the I mean, I know if you look at where I'm at right now, I'm over and a lot of that was due to the license plate recognition technology in addition to an increase in production by our enforcement staff and our clerks because every permit sale every citation creates a charge to the company providing those services.

204
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,828
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what the contracted

205
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:37,190
[SPEAKER_01]: increases are.

206
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,416
[SPEAKER_01]: So with increased production comes increased costs.

207
00:25:43,105 --> 00:26:07,930
[SPEAKER_01]: And upcoming this year, I hope to continue to increase production from the enforcement staff in particular, because I get emails, phone calls, as does the mayor's office quite frequently, wanting more people on their streets to enforce the rules as they are, you know, it's a valid argument because they pay to park on their street and they don't want people there who are not allowed to be there.

208
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,350
[SPEAKER_01]: So we anticipate

209
00:26:11,151 --> 00:26:20,656
[SPEAKER_01]: we've already seen an increase in the production since I became director in December, and that there's still opportunity for growth there.

210
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:36,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we should make note that on February 1st, the price of parking permits, residential parking permits, and business, commuter, several of the other permit categories were increased for the first time since the early 80s.

211
00:26:36,023 --> 00:26:36,443
[SPEAKER_01]: So we anticipate

212
00:26:40,626 --> 00:26:43,309
[SPEAKER_01]: additional revenue from permit sales in the fall.

213
00:26:44,590 --> 00:27:01,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things on my to-do list is to propose that anybody renewing their permit in the fall will have to pay any citations that are outstanding for the vehicle for which they want to buy a permit, which will hopefully

214
00:27:03,168 --> 00:27:06,150
[SPEAKER_01]: the amount of outstanding citations in our banks.

215
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,511
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be an increase for this year.

216
00:27:09,312 --> 00:27:15,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Um and hopefully maintain that percentage level of return on citations.

217
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:18,596
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that's upcoming.

218
00:27:19,057 --> 00:27:26,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, there are a couple of more payments for the LPR system, which I know is currently being reviewed by the City Council.

219
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:29,882
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyhow, so that is one of the increases.

220
00:27:29,902 --> 00:27:29,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Um

221
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:36,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's all I have for the future that I can think of right now.

222
00:27:37,897 --> 00:27:38,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

223
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:39,097
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's helpful.

224
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:52,400
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing we don't get to see here in this picture, and if you don't have the data, you know, we can put in a request or I would put one in, but just, you know, you in some ways are unique as a department that you bring in revenue.

225
00:27:52,560 --> 00:28:00,042
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was just wondering what your annual revenue was or your expectations of it for this year and your expectations of it for next year?

226
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:00,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

227
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:02,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now.

228
00:28:02,802 --> 00:28:08,026
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't total it on here, but the last.

229
00:28:09,407 --> 00:28:11,909
[SPEAKER_01]: So January was a renewal month, so it was very high.

230
00:28:11,969 --> 00:28:12,309
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at 188.

231
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:18,141
[SPEAKER_01]: 624 in deposits, revenue deposits for that month.

232
00:28:18,941 --> 00:28:19,981
[SPEAKER_01]: And January was $170,222.

233
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:20,661
[SPEAKER_01]: February was $151,761.

234
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:21,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And March, our total deposits were $169,009.

235
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:22,042
[SPEAKER_01]: So $169,009.

236
00:28:22,182 --> 00:28:24,142
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have not seen, we've seen

237
00:28:38,905 --> 00:28:51,573
[SPEAKER_01]: higher rates of deposits, and that includes meter revenue, citation revenue, permit revenue, any revenue that comes in for any fines or permits is all totaled up in those totals.

238
00:28:52,954 --> 00:28:56,716
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the increased production, that will only go up.

239
00:28:58,457 --> 00:29:03,740
[SPEAKER_01]: With the permit price increase, that should maintain

240
00:29:06,643 --> 00:29:11,025
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, last April, the April 2024, the total deposits were $125,368.

241
00:29:11,065 --> 00:29:12,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And this March, our total deposits were $169,009.

242
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,226
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was an increase from last year.

243
00:29:14,506 --> 00:29:16,807
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's due to permit price increases and higher production of citations.

244
00:29:31,707 --> 00:29:33,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just more permit offerings as well.

245
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:40,235
[SPEAKER_01]: There's additional things that the parking department is offering the public that it didn't offer this time last year.

246
00:29:40,856 --> 00:29:42,498
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something else.

247
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:49,325
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's other proposed permits on the table, things that we're reviewing to see if it's something that the public could benefit from.

248
00:29:51,878 --> 00:30:05,148
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I don't, granted, the first few months of the year, people are still renewing from last year, but I don't anticipate a decrease in the production of citations.

249
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:10,792
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of permits we sell will go down, but citations will continue to stay steady or rise.

250
00:30:14,434 --> 00:30:25,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I think overall, if nothing else, we have, we will be self-sustaining through 2026 if the metrics stay similar to where they're at.

251
00:30:26,842 --> 00:30:27,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's helpful.

252
00:30:27,863 --> 00:30:37,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, you know, for, I know like a big cost driver, this was the first contract for the team in the parking department.

253
00:30:37,249 --> 00:30:43,774
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was really the significant increase, but excuse me, I think just for me, it would be really helpful

254
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:52,076
[SPEAKER_08]: to have revenue numbers across like the fiscal year, so from July 1, 24 through June 30, 25.

255
00:30:52,396 --> 00:31:13,153
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it'd be useful for us to, when we talk about your budget, to see that and then maybe also see like the balance outstanding on citations, things like that, because it is really more of a in and out versus, you know, most of the departments are not fee driven or, you know, they're not generating revenue in the same way.

256
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:28,764
[SPEAKER_08]: And just along those lines, yeah, I just think that would be really helpful for us to be able to see how much money is the department bringing in the fiscal year versus what's going out.

257
00:31:29,165 --> 00:31:35,650
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just remember my other question, are there any expenses that you guys spend that aren't included in this budget?

258
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:41,956
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, do you have any spending outside of the, like, for example, other departments will get a grant and then

259
00:31:42,832 --> 00:31:45,914
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, that wouldn't be reflected here, like they've paid for something with a grant.

260
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:51,237
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, yeah, we don't have any interns grants, federally funded items at this time.

261
00:31:51,598 --> 00:31:56,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe there was a truck that was purchased with ARPA funds that has not yet arrived.

262
00:31:56,941 --> 00:32:02,505
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, there's not been nothing that I've been made aware of since I began in December.

263
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:07,568
[SPEAKER_08]: So this reflects like the all the payments for the all the services that we

264
00:32:08,347 --> 00:32:26,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, the biggest chunk of which is the professional services provided by the vendors who manage the meters, our pay-by-phone application that allows people to pay with their phone, and then G-Techno, which is the parking management company that allows us to make permits and citations happen.

265
00:32:28,098 --> 00:32:35,242
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and those are the three that the costs go up as the production goes up.

266
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:37,563
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.

267
00:32:38,125 --> 00:33:02,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, awesome, yeah, so if you could, you know, get back to us and some of the columns and let us know, you know, what the revenue has been, you know, and it's just helpful, I'm sure, you know, certainly for permits and a lot of people think in normal years and budget season, we think in fiscal year, so it's helpful for us to get it from that July to June timeframe, so we can see the self-sustaining.

268
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:05,443
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, you know, for me, what I'm getting at is I'm interested to see

269
00:33:06,676 --> 00:33:11,441
[SPEAKER_08]: that, you know, better enforcement of the parking rules, better permit offering, more fees.

270
00:33:12,238 --> 00:33:14,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Are we talking about moving from self-sustaining to revenue generating?

271
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:18,884
[SPEAKER_08]: And what does that mean for your department, for the rest of the city?

272
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:21,887
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, absolutely fair and totally expected that.

273
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:26,551
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to be clear, you would like the fiscal year 25 revenue to date?

274
00:33:26,591 --> 00:33:26,972
[SPEAKER_09]: To date.

275
00:33:27,152 --> 00:33:29,034
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll know April's very soon.

276
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:37,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And would you like to know the percentage of outstanding citations as opposed to total citations for a time period?

277
00:33:38,242 --> 00:33:40,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And any data you have on that would be interesting.

278
00:33:40,084 --> 00:33:40,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I got so much data.

279
00:33:40,924 --> 00:33:41,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

280
00:33:41,405 --> 00:33:45,428
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think we, I don't know, Matt, I think would love to see all the data.

281
00:33:45,628 --> 00:33:49,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I can whip up some reports.

282
00:33:49,891 --> 00:33:51,812
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they're all just mad at me because I'm talking too much.

283
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:56,116
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, no, I think the data is really helpful.

284
00:33:56,136 --> 00:34:00,539
[SPEAKER_08]: And more what I was interested in is like, what's the total outstanding balance of all the citations that people haven't paid?

285
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:04,242
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that that's of interest to me, because it's essentially a

286
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:08,576
[SPEAKER_08]: something we should be getting.

287
00:34:08,756 --> 00:34:09,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

288
00:34:09,156 --> 00:34:21,319
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I was going to propose that anybody renewing will have to pay any outstanding because there are several cars that are permitted to park on their street but have outstanding citations.

289
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:25,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I can tell you that the University of Massachusetts got me a couple of years with that.

290
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,961
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked at three different universities and I know what you're talking about.

291
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:32,702
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had to pay my tickets to get my parking permit and I think that's just fair.

292
00:34:33,603 --> 00:34:37,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's pretty standard among the places I've worked in the parking department.

293
00:34:37,966 --> 00:34:38,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

294
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

295
00:34:39,347 --> 00:34:39,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

296
00:34:40,908 --> 00:34:45,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Would someone be willing to make my request in the form of a motion for the committee report?

297
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:47,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

298
00:34:53,035 --> 00:34:55,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming, I guess.

299
00:34:57,698 --> 00:34:58,779
[SPEAKER_08]: We're a little punch drunk here.

300
00:34:58,799 --> 00:34:59,399
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

301
00:34:59,499 --> 00:35:00,400
[SPEAKER_10]: It's fine.

302
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:07,670
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, do we have any further questions on the parking department?

303
00:35:08,991 --> 00:35:14,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Members of the Council, seeing none, online or in person, do we have any questions from members of the public, either in person or on Zoom?

304
00:35:15,934 --> 00:35:17,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, Vice President Collins.

305
00:35:19,276 --> 00:35:19,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

306
00:35:19,596 --> 00:35:21,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have a question, just a comment.

307
00:35:22,298 --> 00:35:22,438
[SPEAKER_05]: It's

308
00:35:25,598 --> 00:35:34,960
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, I started my term when we were still contracting out parking services to a private vendor, so I just want to thank you for taking over the helm of the still quite new department.

309
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:46,263
[SPEAKER_05]: It is very exciting to see it be brought further in-house and see it solidify there and see what the staff and you as our department head are continuing to do to

310
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:50,405
[SPEAKER_05]: help it be embedded into our city services here.

311
00:35:51,666 --> 00:35:52,306
[SPEAKER_05]: It's exciting stuff.

312
00:35:52,346 --> 00:35:57,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's a lot to manage, probably one of our more complicated city departments.

313
00:35:58,229 --> 00:36:01,591
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to thank you for your work and for your transparency with us.

314
00:36:02,752 --> 00:36:03,072
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

315
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:06,534
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no place I'd rather be doing this kind of work than my hometown.

316
00:36:06,554 --> 00:36:08,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

317
00:36:08,995 --> 00:36:14,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and I think, you know, we're looking at the budget, so sometimes

318
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:26,506
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes we talk more, sometimes we talk less, but I also know that like the folks out on the street have sometimes a very difficult job and folks are not always happy to get a parking ticket or have to pay a parking ticket.

319
00:36:26,646 --> 00:36:28,667
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, we've heard a lot about that.

320
00:36:28,707 --> 00:36:38,492
[SPEAKER_08]: So I hope that maybe some of that is easing up as the new department has, people have settled in in the city with the new department and, you know, just want to

321
00:36:39,252 --> 00:36:51,257
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could take that back to the team and obviously to yourself that we understand sometimes that it's a really difficult experience and we are really thankful for all the work that you're doing.

322
00:36:51,698 --> 00:36:51,998
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

323
00:36:52,178 --> 00:36:52,678
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let them know.

324
00:36:53,038 --> 00:36:53,318
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

325
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:54,879
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

326
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Just on the motion of Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Leming.

327
00:37:02,342 --> 00:37:03,283
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

328
00:37:03,983 --> 00:37:05,044
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Callahan is absent.

329
00:37:05,244 --> 00:37:05,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Vice President Collins.

330
00:37:07,368 --> 00:37:12,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Councilor Lazzaro, Councilor Leming, Councilor Scarpelli is absent, Councilor Tseng.

331
00:37:14,354 --> 00:37:15,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I thought my mic was on, yes.

332
00:37:16,596 --> 00:37:17,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, President Ferris.

333
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:19,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, by the affirmative, two absent, motion passes.

334
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:20,639
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

335
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,000
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, have a good night.

336
00:37:22,701 --> 00:37:24,823
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Veterans Services.

337
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,005
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Director Shaw with us.

338
00:37:28,446 --> 00:37:29,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll start reading.

339
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:29,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're already here.

340
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Last year, fiscal 25, we had a budget $444,603.44.

341
00:37:34,342 --> 00:37:35,443
[SPEAKER_08]: This year, we're looking at a $448,716, an increase of $4,112.56.

342
00:37:35,483 --> 00:37:38,803
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is step increase and COLA increase and clerical contract increases, all fixed cost growth.

343
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:44,284
[SPEAKER_08]: And with that, if there's anything more you'd like to say about the specifics of the budget, any highlights from the past year, any exciting plans for next year, the floor is yours.

344
00:38:03,726 --> 00:38:06,608
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as the budget goes, nothing is changing.

345
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:12,474
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done really well with staying in within our budget.

346
00:38:12,634 --> 00:38:20,702
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we've made some adjustments to lower our costs that have been really fun for the community as well.

347
00:38:20,742 --> 00:38:22,704
[SPEAKER_06]: We did all of our wreaths this year.

348
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:27,268
[SPEAKER_06]: For Patriots Day and Memorial Day, we did a community event at the Senior Center.

349
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:30,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Which was it was a lot of fun.

350
00:38:30,271 --> 00:38:34,876
[SPEAKER_06]: It was community engagement and it saved our office almost $2,000.

351
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:40,822
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was pretty cool.

352
00:38:40,842 --> 00:38:43,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And for our highlights for the year.

353
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:47,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of it is sort of standard fare.

354
00:38:47,147 --> 00:38:49,389
[SPEAKER_06]: We did our Veterans Day program at the high school.

355
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:52,612
[SPEAKER_06]: We also did one at First Baptist Church.

356
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:58,297
[SPEAKER_06]: We were able to get the landlord incentive program passed.

357
00:38:58,637 --> 00:39:04,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, I still have not been able to make any connections between landlords and veterans.

358
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:06,664
[SPEAKER_06]: I have several veterans that are looking.

359
00:39:06,684 --> 00:39:08,606
[SPEAKER_06]: They just can't afford the rents here.

360
00:39:09,367 --> 00:39:10,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Even with that incentive,

361
00:39:14,015 --> 00:39:15,637
[SPEAKER_06]: just hasn't worked.

362
00:39:15,737 --> 00:39:26,286
[SPEAKER_06]: So went back to the drawing board and one of my goals for this year is to find another way of making housing easier and better for veterans here in Medford.

363
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:39,799
[SPEAKER_06]: I've started working with my fellow VSOs from the surrounding cities, which has been a really incredible experience collaborating with them, seeing what they're doing in their cities,

364
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:43,800
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done two big programs.

365
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:48,261
[SPEAKER_06]: We did one over at Tufts and one here in the city and chambers.

366
00:39:48,281 --> 00:39:52,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of an expo was done over at Tufts.

367
00:39:52,802 --> 00:39:56,263
[SPEAKER_06]: It cost Medford nothing, which was nice.

368
00:39:56,503 --> 00:40:01,384
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we did another one here that was to help get veterans

369
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:08,103
[SPEAKER_06]: that are connected to the VA health care system online, the online system, which can be pretty confusing.

370
00:40:10,147 --> 00:40:11,309
[SPEAKER_06]: That was also great.

371
00:40:13,672 --> 00:40:25,457
[SPEAKER_06]: For my collaborations with the fellow VSOs, we're looking at housing and how it works with their cities and see if there's anything we can do together to help veterans.

372
00:40:25,477 --> 00:40:35,461
[SPEAKER_06]: We've all seen an increase in homeless veterans in our areas, as well as just struggling veterans that have jobs and what we can do to help them.

373
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:47,284
[SPEAKER_06]: So another financial thing for our office is that we had planned on making our office ADA compliant.

374
00:40:48,485 --> 00:40:54,429
[SPEAKER_06]: We had several veterans that couldn't even enter our office because we had that big desk in the way.

375
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:56,570
[SPEAKER_06]: They couldn't get in, couldn't maneuver.

376
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,652
[SPEAKER_06]: We were having conversations in the hallway.

377
00:41:00,013 --> 00:41:03,355
[SPEAKER_06]: We had quotes and it was gonna be roughly around $40,000 and I did it for free.

378
00:41:06,854 --> 00:41:11,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I just shut the office down for a couple hours, got some muscle and we move stuff around.

379
00:41:11,498 --> 00:41:14,361
[SPEAKER_06]: So now our office is ADA compliant and spent $0 doing it.

380
00:41:20,544 --> 00:41:29,032
[SPEAKER_06]: The other nice thing that we're doing in our office is this year Medford is participating in Wreaths Across America at Christmas.

381
00:41:29,112 --> 00:41:34,777
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a nonprofit that provides wreaths for veterans graves.

382
00:41:35,018 --> 00:41:37,340
[SPEAKER_06]: No money passes through our office.

383
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,585
[SPEAKER_06]: All the money for the wreaths goes directly to the nonprofit to pay for the wreaths.

384
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,786
[SPEAKER_06]: They transport them and

385
00:41:46,268 --> 00:41:48,909
[SPEAKER_06]: We will put a team together to put them out.

386
00:41:49,189 --> 00:41:51,389
[SPEAKER_06]: It comes in December right before Christmas.

387
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:56,290
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love to see an increase in participation in that.

388
00:41:56,551 --> 00:41:59,411
[SPEAKER_06]: Our goal right now is 250 wreaths.

389
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:02,752
[SPEAKER_06]: And as we hit that goal, we'll keep extending it.

390
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:06,853
[SPEAKER_06]: We have until November to get all of those wreaths paid for.

391
00:42:06,873 --> 00:42:10,434
[SPEAKER_06]: They're $17 if anybody wanted to purchase a wreath.

392
00:42:13,304 --> 00:42:21,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, my goals for this year are really all veteran centered.

393
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:25,554
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no increase in money required for any of my goals.

394
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:32,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see an increase in participation in our senior coffee hour.

395
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:39,225
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm pleased to report with just one robo call, I doubled my attendance last week.

396
00:42:39,785 --> 00:42:40,566
[SPEAKER_06]: which was awesome.

397
00:42:40,606 --> 00:42:41,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I reached some new veterans.

398
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:48,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I was a little disappointed to find out that at least two of them had no idea my office existed.

399
00:42:49,477 --> 00:42:50,278
[SPEAKER_06]: But now they do.

400
00:42:50,298 --> 00:42:52,481
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was awesome.

401
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:57,287
[SPEAKER_06]: We doubled our numbers, I got to meet some new veterans and their wives.

402
00:42:58,378 --> 00:43:06,460
[SPEAKER_06]: My goal that I gave to the mayor for this year was to increase my coffee hour attendance by 75%.

403
00:43:09,161 --> 00:43:10,261
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm almost there.

404
00:43:10,281 --> 00:43:15,683
[SPEAKER_06]: My goal was to have an increase of 12 veterans and I had five new last week.

405
00:43:17,783 --> 00:43:19,424
[SPEAKER_06]: and the race across America.

406
00:43:19,444 --> 00:43:32,386
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to bring the veterans office kind of into this century, get rid of some of our paper files, we can't legally throw anything away, but we can certainly package it up, put it downstairs.

407
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:40,108
[SPEAKER_06]: So our goal over the next year is to take all of our files, which if you've ever been in our office, we have

408
00:43:41,068 --> 00:43:44,229
[SPEAKER_06]: five filing cabinets full of files on veterans.

409
00:43:45,149 --> 00:43:57,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Our goal is to digitize everything, make it easier for our access, for the veterans access when they come in, we don't have to dig through files, and clear up some space, put everything downstairs in the basement.

410
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:04,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And that way there's, for future veteran service officers, they'll have access to all of that as well.

411
00:44:06,115 --> 00:44:11,578
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably going to take a whole year because there is just so much.

412
00:44:11,918 --> 00:44:14,820
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, it's not going to cost anything other than time.

413
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:19,762
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's really it.

414
00:44:19,843 --> 00:44:20,423
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just

415
00:44:22,072 --> 00:44:27,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than my biggest thing that is increasing visibility in the community.

416
00:44:28,275 --> 00:44:36,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year, I did two outreach events at two separate churches, because they were the only ones that invited me in.

417
00:44:36,819 --> 00:44:44,923
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was just surprised at how many veterans and their spouses don't know that my office exists.

418
00:44:46,644 --> 00:44:49,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wanna get out more and

419
00:44:50,377 --> 00:44:53,298
[SPEAKER_06]: let people know that I am here for them.

420
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Let them know that Chapter 115 exists.

421
00:45:00,301 --> 00:45:02,582
[SPEAKER_06]: That's our program to help low-income veterans.

422
00:45:04,203 --> 00:45:09,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate hearing about veterans that aren't getting enough to eat or can't pay their bills.

423
00:45:09,285 --> 00:45:10,946
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm here for, is to help them.

424
00:45:11,026 --> 00:45:14,647
[SPEAKER_06]: So anything to increase our visibility within the community.

425
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:18,789
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's pretty much it.

426
00:45:20,571 --> 00:45:21,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

427
00:45:21,372 --> 00:45:27,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I really wanna just start by thanking you for your resourcefulness and your dedication to our veterans in the community.

428
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:38,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you do a lot with the budget that you have and then you go and above and beyond to try to bring in whatever resources are possible for our veterans.

429
00:45:38,384 --> 00:45:42,947
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's just really great to hear.

430
00:45:42,967 --> 00:45:46,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate, I love hearing the, what have we done?

431
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:47,230
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we doing list?

432
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:48,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think it really just shows

433
00:45:50,187 --> 00:45:56,590
[SPEAKER_08]: things that maybe don't show up in budget line items or don't show up anywhere else other than you being able to tell everyone what's happening.

434
00:45:56,610 --> 00:46:01,392
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you so much for everything that you've been doing and what you're going to be doing for the next year.

435
00:46:02,613 --> 00:46:08,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to Councilor Leming, then Councilor Lazzaro, then Councilor Collins.

436
00:46:08,775 --> 00:46:10,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we all have to be speaking this late?

437
00:46:10,596 --> 00:46:11,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

438
00:46:11,677 --> 00:46:12,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, guys.

439
00:46:12,697 --> 00:46:16,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, thanks for staying, Veronica.

440
00:46:16,419 --> 00:46:18,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry that you had to stay this late.

441
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,640
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

442
00:46:19,629 --> 00:46:21,811
[SPEAKER_02]: two and a half hour meeting that we just had.

443
00:46:21,831 --> 00:46:24,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're doing a wonderful job.

444
00:46:29,258 --> 00:46:34,924
[SPEAKER_02]: If you keep running into the problem, no uptakes on that renter program, then

445
00:46:35,734 --> 00:46:43,978
[SPEAKER_02]: sure it's doable to just come back to us and we can bring up raising that $750 limit.

446
00:46:44,418 --> 00:46:57,243
[SPEAKER_02]: I think given how under budget you seem to be, that's more than justifiable and I'd rather have it apply to like, you know, a smaller number of veterans and nobody at all.

447
00:46:57,843 --> 00:47:01,585
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I understand that $750 a year might not be

448
00:47:02,745 --> 00:47:13,034
[SPEAKER_02]: all that enough to make or break anybody but so yeah we could we could work on raising that we just need a recommendation for what you think would make a make a difference in that case so thank you again

449
00:47:20,957 --> 00:47:34,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, thank you for the presentation, I was wondering when you do the veterans coffee hour if it would be beneficial ever some of our members as part of our resident services and.

450
00:47:34,521 --> 00:47:43,743
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of we do like Community outreach listening sessions sometimes so if it would be helpful for one of our Members to come to.

451
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:50,707
[SPEAKER_03]: coffee hours and maybe just hear what veterans have as concerns in the community.

452
00:47:50,727 --> 00:47:52,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that might be a good opportunity to

453
00:47:53,551 --> 00:47:58,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, just just hear from our residents in a new environment.

454
00:47:58,734 --> 00:48:01,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd be happy to talk about that possibility.

455
00:48:02,056 --> 00:48:02,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we could.

456
00:48:02,716 --> 00:48:03,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

457
00:48:03,397 --> 00:48:04,457
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love that.

458
00:48:04,477 --> 00:48:07,579
[SPEAKER_06]: They often ask me questions that I don't know the answers to.

459
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:07,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

460
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,140
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, absolutely.

461
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,842
[SPEAKER_06]: It's we do it on the fourth Friday of every month.

462
00:48:12,082 --> 00:48:12,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

463
00:48:12,302 --> 00:48:13,123
[SPEAKER_03]: What time is that?

464
00:48:13,203 --> 00:48:13,503
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 o'clock.

465
00:48:13,863 --> 00:48:14,063
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

466
00:48:14,523 --> 00:48:20,707
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so maybe that would be something that we can discuss in Resident Services Committee meeting in the future.

467
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:25,894
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know that we need to make a motion about it, but we could just Do I need to make a motion about it?

468
00:48:26,835 --> 00:48:35,442
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion of Councilor Lazzaro, I motion to, uh, It's a motion now, Matt.

469
00:48:38,244 --> 00:48:41,567
[SPEAKER_08]: You can just put a resolution on also, if you wanted to talk about in residence services.

470
00:48:46,577 --> 00:48:48,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we don't need a motion.

471
00:48:48,098 --> 00:48:51,381
[SPEAKER_08]: I was all right.

472
00:48:51,961 --> 00:48:59,047
[SPEAKER_03]: I think many of us would love to have an opportunity to talk to folks and, you know, figure out where where people are at and what their needs are.

473
00:48:59,548 --> 00:49:00,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'd love for that.

474
00:49:01,209 --> 00:49:01,529
