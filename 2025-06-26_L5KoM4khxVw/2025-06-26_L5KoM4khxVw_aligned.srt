00:00:00,957 --> 00:00:04,359
Good evening and welcome to tonight's meeting of the Medford Community Development Board.

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:06,140
I'll call the meeting to order.

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,502
Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters first.

4
00:00:10,963 --> 00:00:12,965

Present.

25
00:01:28,492 --> 00:01:30,073
Sherrod watch area.

26
00:01:32,154 --> 00:01:33,595
And myself, Jackie mcpherson.

27
00:01:36,217 --> 00:01:38,618
Danielle, can you introduce any staff on the call, please?

28
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,660
Yes, madam chair.

29
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:51,627
Um, we have myself Daniel Evans, senior planner, Alicia hunt, who's the director of planning, development, sustainability, Amanda centrala, who is a staff planner.

30
00:01:52,127 --> 00:01:54,689
And then we have clams on here.

31
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:56,670
Yep, clam dish is do you set

32
00:01:58,793 --> 00:02:10,435
or Ducette, a graduate student intern in planning, development, and sustainability.

33
00:02:12,616 --> 00:02:13,096
Thank you.

34
00:02:13,976 --> 00:02:18,737
So our first item on the agenda for today is a special permit drive-through use.

35
00:02:18,757 --> 00:02:21,578
The 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, Bank of America.

36
00:02:21,938 --> 00:02:22,798
It was continued from 9-20-23.

37
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:31,496
The applicant is applying for a special permit for a bank with drive-thru ATM at 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is the Wagons Plaza.

38
00:02:32,036 --> 00:02:37,901
The special permit grant authority is the city council, and it has been referred to the city board for the board's recommendation on the matter.

39
00:02:38,582 --> 00:02:46,949
The matter has been continued several times in order to redesign the site plan to satisfy planning staff and for sign off from other tenants of the shopping plaza.

40
00:02:50,222 --> 00:03:01,910
An overall project summary is that the existing site currently houses a surface parking lot and is bounded by commercial properties to the north, Leonard Street to the east, Locust Street to the west, and a northern access drive to Meadow Glen to the south.

41
00:03:02,491 --> 00:03:10,296
The proposed project will construct an approximate 5,413 square foot bank with one drive-through lane and one drive-through bypass lane.

42
00:03:11,697 --> 00:03:15,340
I'm going to now invite the applicant to present any updates to the proposal.

43
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:19,363
Danielle, can you please introduce all members of the applicant?

44
00:03:21,046 --> 00:03:23,347
Let's see.

45
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:27,510
Anyone here from the applicant team?

46
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:35,895
Are folks able to unmute themselves?

47
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:40,078
I don't see.

48
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,862
They should have permissions to do that, yes.

49
00:03:50,091 --> 00:03:53,432
to unmute themselves, usually the applicant team would raise their hand.

50
00:03:53,452 --> 00:04:02,855
I can confirm that we can unmute ourselves, but I am not with the applicant team.

51
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:03,575
Okay.

52
00:04:04,615 --> 00:04:08,877
I'm trying to see if the names are jumping out at me.

53
00:04:08,897 --> 00:04:10,017
Maybe they are not here yet.

54
00:04:10,037 --> 00:04:16,679
Let's see.

55
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:25,442
Do we want to table this and then move to the next item?

56
00:04:25,462 --> 00:04:26,543
Sure.

57
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:28,364
Do we need to make a motion?

58
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:28,424
No.

59
00:04:31,686 --> 00:04:37,210
I don't think it's a motion to table it to the end of the meet or later in the meet and just to another date certain.

60
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,751
OK.

61
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,672
Well, I mean, if they show up.

62
00:04:40,952 --> 00:04:43,534
Oh, you mean like we're not going to continue it.

63
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:45,375
We're just going to see.

64
00:04:45,915 --> 00:04:48,217
No, we're just moving it until later in the meeting.

65
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:48,277
OK.

66
00:04:56,273 --> 00:04:56,713
Okay.

67
00:04:57,054 --> 00:05:02,238
We're going to go to the next item on our agenda, which is 590 Boston Ave site plan review amendment.

68
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:21,473
The applicant is applying for an amendment to the previously approved site plan, special permit, and variances for the construction of a mixed use building that will contain 45 residential units and approximately 1,464 square feet of retail space with parking at grade located at the property 590 Boston Ave, Medford Mass, 02155.

69
00:05:23,052 --> 00:05:28,797
The original project was approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals in July 2021, but the design has been slightly revised.

70
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:32,620
The applicant is invited to present to the board.

71
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,683
Danielle, can you please introduce the applicant?

72
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:48,833
We have Peter Quinn is the architect.

73
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,136
I believe Attorney Barone is

74
00:05:53,028 --> 00:05:55,791
representing the applicant team.

75
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:00,676
Unmute.

76
00:06:02,677 --> 00:06:03,198
Good evening.

77
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:03,839
Yes.

78
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:05,000
Good evening.

79
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:10,626
Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board.

80
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:12,507
My name is Michael Barone, Jr.

81
00:06:12,527 --> 00:06:17,989
I'm an attorney with Roberto Israel Weiner with offices at 255 State Street in Boston.

82
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:25,752
My office represents Anteleto Brothers, Inc., the property owner and proposed developer for this site at 590 Boston Avenue.

83
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:37,605
With me tonight are Joseph Aniletto, the petitioner, Peter Quinn, the project architect, and Jack Sullivan, the project engineer.

84
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:49,911
As mentioned a little earlier, prior to COVID and the recent revisions to the zoning ordinance, the applicant and his project were previously before this board, at which time the board affirmatively voted to recommend

85
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:55,016
to the Board of Appeals that they approve special permit for site plan review.

86
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:59,681
The Board of Appeals unanimously approved the project and requested our variances thereafter.

87
00:07:00,673 --> 00:07:11,082
As you may recall, this project involves a proposed mixed-use five-story building on the southeasterly corner of Boston Avenue and Harvard Street at 590 Boston Avenue.

88
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:22,932
We are here this evening to request modifications to the previously reviewed site plan due to modifications made to the plans following the recent revisions to the city's zoning ordinance.

89
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:26,215
First, a little bit about this property.

90
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:28,896
I'm sure many of you are familiar with the property.

91
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:32,958
It's currently operated as Titan Gas and Car Wash.

92
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:40,363
It's been owned and operated by Petitioner Joseph Anoletto and has been run by his family for the past several decades.

93
00:07:41,223 --> 00:07:48,908
The premises is situated on a rectangular lot in the industrial zoning district just north of the Greenline Extension Ball Square Station.

94
00:07:49,808 --> 00:08:07,489
The premises is subject to an easement for the benefit of the MBTA along the Green Line extension line and another easement for the benefit of the City of Medford for maintaining a retaining wall along Harvard Street right at the underpass below the MBTA line.

95
00:08:08,473 --> 00:08:15,978
So, I'll provide a very quick overview of the practical changes to this project, Peter will go a little more in depth.

96
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:26,784
But generally speaking, this project was reconfigured as a result of the recent revisions to the zoning ordinance.

97
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:27,745
So, to that effect.

98
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:31,207
We've decreased the total gross floor area.

99
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:34,489
We've reduced lot coverage, we've reduced the height.

100
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:47,757
We've increased the retail space, increased the number of residential units from 40 to 45 and reconfigured that allocation of studios, one bedrooms and two bedrooms.

101
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:48,998
We've added

102
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:58,390
two additional bike spacings, and we actually removed six parking spaces to make us now compliant with the ordinance.

103
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:12,844
Of particular note, and one of the big impetuses for this project's modification is we've actually removed the below grade parking and moved the parking back up to grade.

104
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:24,049
So in doing so, it's allowed us to remove several retaining walls that were along the southerly lot line, it allowed us to remove a retaining wall along the green line extension.

105
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:35,675
It's also allowed us to relocate the drainage system, and it's also allowed us to reconfigure the entrance aisle permitting two way traffic and a 24 foot wide traffic aisle.

106
00:09:36,435 --> 00:09:54,350
So in light of these revisions, and the revisions to the zoning ordinance, we do require some modifications to our variances as well so I'm, I will briefly run through those modifications just so the boards familiar I don't want to spend too much time.

107
00:09:57,133 --> 00:10:09,885
Three variances that were obtained by the board of appeals back in 2021 have now been rendered moot as a result of compliance with the code and to that effect we have the rear yard is now compliant.

108
00:10:10,805 --> 00:10:16,291
Our parking setback to the lot line is now compliant and our off street parking is now compliant.

109
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:19,253
We've also reduced

110
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:34,086
Non compliance, so we have 6 variances that were granted that now will still be required, but we can say affirmatively that our non conformity is has been decreased.

111
00:10:34,126 --> 00:10:34,887
So, to that effect.

112
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:41,530
Landscaped open space, we have decreased that variance required.

113
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:49,194
Usable open space has been increased, but the variance, the relief needed has been decreased.

114
00:10:49,534 --> 00:10:52,096
We have decreased the noncompliance of our front yard.

115
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:56,178
Our side yard along Harvard Street has been slightly decreased.

116
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:04,642
Our max height has been reduced, therefore shrinking our variance there, and our lot coverage has also been reduced.

117
00:11:06,063 --> 00:11:19,426
Now, as a result of the modifications, we will be seeking three variances, one of which is a modification, two of which will be quote-unquote new variances.

118
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:31,288
And I say quote-unquote because one was a side yard variance that was requested back in 2020, but for whatever reason, never made it onto the decision.

119
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:35,451
So that will be a side yard variance.

120
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:39,775
Fortunately, we are now only seeking a 1.2 foot variance.

121
00:11:39,815 --> 00:11:44,899
The original request was upwards of 23 and a half feet.

122
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:59,226
For the parking setback, we originally needed a variance for parking setback from the lot line and did not require one for parking setback from the structure.

123
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:07,110
As you may be aware, multifamily requires that parking spaces be at least 6 feet from the structure.

124
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,932
In this case, we are seeking a variance to permit

125
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:13,954
our parking spaces within six feet of the structure.

126
00:12:14,755 --> 00:12:22,402
Because we added some units, we also need to modify our existing variance for lot area per dwelling unit.

127
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:27,668
So now I want to take a step back.

128
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:35,153
And again, just for the new members of the board, really look at this project in the context of the neighborhood.

129
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,879
So as you may be aware, the property is located at the southeast corner of Harvard and Boston Avenue.

130
00:12:42,939 --> 00:12:51,846
And Boston Avenue really is right in the center of the industrial zoning district that runs through the city, or at least this portion of the city.

131
00:12:53,387 --> 00:13:00,309
But oddly enough, that industrial zoning district also directly abuts the general residential zoning district to the west.

132
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:07,690
To that effect, what we have in this corridor is no longer strictly industrial uses.

133
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:19,033
Next to the railroad, we have now seen a tremendous shift to a mix of residential uses, multifamily uses, institutional uses, and even several religious establishments.

134
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:38,168
This is most clear on the easterly side of Boston Avenue where our project is located, where you have Tufts University at 574 Boston Avenue, and several multifamily projects at 616 Boston Avenue and the Sphere luxury apartments at 640 Boston Avenue.

135
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:56,017
Looking at that in addition to the neighboring general residential district across the street, we believe this project continues to make significant sense as you have that transition from the general residential area into this transitioning industrial zone.

136
00:13:56,837 --> 00:14:02,881
We believe that the Green Line extension further adds to that despite its current condition.

137
00:14:03,961 --> 00:14:11,365
And with that, I think I will turn it over to Peter to give a more thorough overview of the revisions to the site plan.

138
00:14:12,786 --> 00:14:13,146
Thank you.

139
00:14:13,246 --> 00:14:13,686
Good evening.

140
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:18,769
My name is Peter Quinn of Peter Quinn Architects in Davis Square, Somerville.

141
00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:25,852
I would like to just take you through mostly the changes that were made.

142
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:29,934
I think that will also explain the project well enough for those who haven't seen it before.

143
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:35,901
And I will add a few comments to what Michael has already said.

144
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:39,383
Let me just share my screen here, if I may.

145
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:42,926
All right.

146
00:14:43,987 --> 00:14:57,397
So the building itself is now, hold on a minute, just having a little trouble clicking the things here.

147
00:14:57,677 --> 00:14:57,997
There we go.

148
00:14:59,134 --> 00:15:03,215
So this is the view that we're proposing for the building at the corner.

149
00:15:04,095 --> 00:15:14,277
The previous view here was like this, somewhat similar, you know, with a retail space that projected forward toward the sidewalk.

150
00:15:15,437 --> 00:15:27,600
In this case, in the previous plan, we had raised the basement roof so that we had a plinth that the building was based on, and below that was the garage.

151
00:15:28,765 --> 00:15:31,528
we have been able to eliminate that thing.

152
00:15:31,548 --> 00:15:40,178
And now we have essentially a planting area in the front that's available for trees and the like.

153
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:45,664
And also the handicapped access is much easier.

154
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:49,609
We just put a ramp in before we had a lift to get up there.

155
00:15:51,345 --> 00:15:59,790
And we've also tried to really address the corner more and have a more robust elevation on both sides of the corner.

156
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:12,677
In the previous scheme, we were somewhat flat on the side, on the left side, that would be Harvard Street, and the building itself was maybe a little flatter than what we have now.

157
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:22,081
We also introduced a brick base that we didn't have before.

158
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:28,565
The base before was just for the plinth and then it was wood frame all the way down to the top of the plinth.

159
00:16:28,725 --> 00:16:36,070
This, I think, actually lightens the massing of the building somewhat and makes it kind of more visually interesting at the street run.

160
00:16:39,057 --> 00:16:41,979
The number of units, as Michael mentioned, is now 45.

161
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:48,904
I do want to point out that the number of bedrooms in the building is exactly the same as we had before.

162
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:58,011
The only difference is that we have rearranged the units such that we have more smaller units and fewer larger units.

163
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:08,218
We also arranged the building so that the units stack vertically, or to save some money, rather than change as they go up through the building as the previous team had.

164
00:17:10,073 --> 00:17:18,196
In our layout, we have a number of amenity spaces on the ground floor.

165
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:21,297
We have a large retail space at the corner, as I mentioned.

166
00:17:21,997 --> 00:17:31,620
And then behind that, we have a large bike room, which is easy to get into from the front door, taking a bike up a ramp.

167
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:34,842
We also have access to the rear where there's parking.

168
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:38,543
A little over half the parking spaces are under the building.

169
00:17:39,388 --> 00:17:46,731
and then the rest are out toward the retaining wall that is shared with the team at the back of the building.

170
00:17:47,491 --> 00:18:07,659
We have one unit on the ground floor, a nice large unit, and then we go up from there into a layout of, I think it's nine units, no, I'm sorry, 11 units per floor, a mix of studios, ones and twos,

171
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:26,894
And then on the roof level, we have a roof deck and solar panels, and the roof deck has a pergola over it, making it kind of an interesting amenity space for the building, all brought in from the edges so as not to disturb neighbors.

172
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:32,596
And of course, we have plenty of space for mechanical and solar arrays to be put in in the future.

173
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:38,745
A couple of other things that are important to point out that are a little different.

174
00:18:38,925 --> 00:18:44,228
You can see over here on this far right side, there's a brick enclosure.

175
00:18:44,428 --> 00:18:50,431
That's where we put the transformer, so it's not really visible to pedestrians or drivers.

176
00:18:52,091 --> 00:18:58,434
And where we keep it out of the way before we had it in the back, and it was taking up quite a bit of real estate back there.

177
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:16,195
As I mentioned, we have eliminated the basement from the original design and brought all the mechanical equipment, electrical, slipping, and so forth to the ground floor.

178
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:27,138
And I believe that will contribute to our resiliency should there ever be any flooding or that kind of thing in the area, not having those sorts of things in the basement.

179
00:19:28,518 --> 00:19:30,419
Some of the other 3D views.

180
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,620
We'll see, this is how we deal with the parking in the rear.

181
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:35,316
and drive under.

182
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:39,257
Another view here.

183
00:19:39,397 --> 00:19:42,658
This is a corner view away from the corner view.

184
00:19:43,318 --> 00:19:47,139
And the small brick structure in the front is the transformer.

185
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:49,559
You can see the ramp going up to the front door.

186
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:53,100
Beyond that, the commercial area.

187
00:19:53,120 --> 00:20:01,502
Commercial area could have a small enclosed patio area where people could set up tables outside.

188
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:09,578
kind of tried to design this to be sort of a universal set of uses.

189
00:20:09,918 --> 00:20:16,120
It could be a workspace, it could be a cafe, anything like that.

190
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:25,782
And then going up to the building a little further, this is a view looking down Boston Ave toward Ball Square.

191
00:20:26,723 --> 00:20:29,063
You can see there was a number of taller buildings further down.

192
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:39,514
And as you, I'm sure you know, to the left, going down Harvard Street, we'll go under the bridge.

193
00:20:41,435 --> 00:20:49,219
And here's an aerial view, kind of give you the overall appearance of the property.

194
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:59,785
With the landscaping in the front, I'll show you a little more about that landscaping in a minute, and the roof deck, which is enclosed well enough to be very private up there.

195
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:05,128
This is a rear view from the tracks.

196
00:21:06,489 --> 00:21:16,077
Again, we continue this kind of robust articulation on the exterior for decks and underneath the balconies, all the way around the building.

197
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,040
Almost every unit has an outdoor space.

198
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:28,687
There are some studios here in this alignment that don't, but I'd say 90% of the units do have them.

199
00:21:31,728 --> 00:21:33,669
a couple of other things.

200
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:42,475
We actually ran into a little bit of a problem with the previous design when we explored the soils more.

201
00:21:42,555 --> 00:21:51,942
I think something happened when they built this retaining wall for the MDTA, that it raised our water table, and it raised it fairly significantly.

202
00:21:51,982 --> 00:21:59,167
And that, you know, completely from a practical point of view, this also triggered our

203
00:22:00,282 --> 00:22:02,024
rethinking of how to do the parking.

204
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:23,664
It was a happy coincidence that the city also changes parking regulations at the same time because it allowed us to go to grade levels parking, whereas we were seriously wondering whether we could proceed with the project given the water table issues that arose after the wall was built.

205
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:26,993
So, happily, we're out of the water table completely.

206
00:22:27,453 --> 00:22:31,975
And, you know, we've seen sort of the normal construction in our biggest building.

207
00:22:34,076 --> 00:22:36,897
Let me just make sure I got everything covered here.

208
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:40,258
As I mentioned, as was mentioned, we reduced the height of the building.

209
00:22:40,318 --> 00:22:42,459
We're three feet below what we were approved for.

210
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:49,561
We also decreased the floor area of the building in this new scheme by 5,000 square feet.

211
00:22:50,301 --> 00:22:51,962
So, as I said, the units are smaller.

212
00:22:53,398 --> 00:23:00,803
and there may be more units, but overall the building is about 10% smaller than what it was before.

213
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:10,950
So I'm going to stop there and take questions, and I'm happy to go back over any of this or add to it as you may wish.

214
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:11,870
Thank you.

215
00:23:19,976 --> 00:23:23,198
Oh, I meant to just add the landscaping, if I could, just a second.

216
00:23:24,017 --> 00:23:27,199
So in the front of the building, we had very little landscaping before.

217
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,902
This was the plan done by Verdant for us.

218
00:23:31,142 --> 00:23:42,431
We are now able to get a nice garden in the very front of the building with four redbuds and a lot of perennials and shrubs in this area.

219
00:23:43,312 --> 00:23:49,816
So that's just something that was a new feature, and it was part of our attempt to increase the landscape area and open space.

220
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:51,778
Thank you.

221
00:23:55,867 --> 00:24:01,891
Also with me is Jack Sullivan if you have any questions that people have about the civil site plan and drainage and so forth.

222
00:24:05,073 --> 00:24:05,994
Back to you Madam Chair.

223
00:24:10,828 --> 00:24:12,128
Thank you for your presentation.

224
00:24:12,248 --> 00:24:17,950
One of the things that I need, I guess, clarity from, I'm not sure if it's from the city or from the applicant.

225
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:25,271
If you can just synthesize the information, you've gone over in detail, but we're trying to see where we're at right now.

226
00:24:25,411 --> 00:24:32,693
We know, we understand that we no longer need a parking variance and we, and there was, we, I could see the differences in the design.

227
00:24:33,188 --> 00:24:40,274
But I'm trying to better understand where we stand right now in reference to compliance with the department heads comments.

228
00:24:40,594 --> 00:24:55,807
And, um, I guess in the variances, if the city can pretty much point that out, I know that this was approved previously in 2020 with lots of conditions, but I'm having a hard time synthesizing all the information as you're presenting.

229
00:24:56,408 --> 00:24:58,369
So if someone can just give us a high level, um,

230
00:24:59,488 --> 00:25:07,010
overview of exactly what variances that we're looking at right now and how far they are from compliance with the department heads.

231
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,650
That would help.

232
00:25:15,112 --> 00:25:18,313
Have you had a chance to look at the department head comments?

233
00:25:22,294 --> 00:25:23,534
Michael, you want me to answer that?

234
00:25:24,374 --> 00:25:26,495
Yes, if you could, Peter, thank you.

235
00:25:26,535 --> 00:25:27,295
Yeah, sure.

236
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:33,188
Um, yeah, we haven't, we have gone through the department head, um, comments.

237
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:41,612
Um, and, uh, you know, there, there have been some new regulations put in place, uh, for instance, with engineering.

238
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:46,494
Um, and, uh, you know, we, we will address those.

239
00:25:46,634 --> 00:25:49,536
There, some of them are relative to Louisiana.

240
00:25:49,576 --> 00:25:57,720
I don't think Jack can, can, um, confirm what I'm about to say, which is, you know, basically we didn't see anything that we couldn't comply with.

241
00:25:59,045 --> 00:26:04,668
Um, the fire chief wrote a letter that had some new interpretations.

242
00:26:05,108 --> 00:26:10,511
Um, since we had already gotten this building approved, we didn't really change the approach that we were doing.

243
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:17,735
Um, but because we have a new chief here in Medford, um, you know, I think he was looking at it for the first time.

244
00:26:18,596 --> 00:26:24,099
So we have a meeting scheduled with him Wednesday of next week to try to straighten this out and

245
00:26:34,255 --> 00:26:40,537
The other, I guess there were some other sustainability comments.

246
00:26:40,597 --> 00:26:44,278
I don't think we were in pretty good shape with all those.

247
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:49,820
We certainly couldn't make a response on those issues.

248
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,881
It might be difficult.

249
00:26:52,901 --> 00:26:53,481
There are any others.

250
00:26:56,463 --> 00:26:59,606
I know we did have, um, we did have a conversation.

251
00:26:59,646 --> 00:27:08,155
There was a. Point raised by the engineering department that I think is going to go into further conversation.

252
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:10,938
Uh, the, the rounded corner.

253
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,081
Oh, Peter, I'm sorry if you could go back to the.

254
00:27:13,521 --> 00:27:16,144
Yeah, I was just going to bring it up more technically.

255
00:27:16,164 --> 00:27:16,424
Yeah.

256
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:16,704
Okay.

257
00:27:16,764 --> 00:27:17,005
Great.

258
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:29,105
I know previously we had had a conversation about rounding off and handling the corner there as shown in the plans.

259
00:27:29,445 --> 00:27:43,248
And there's now conversation from the engineer that they believe it would be better perhaps for the applicant to instead actually transfer ownership to approximately 50 square feet of that corner to the city.

260
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,788
And we are looking at what

261
00:27:46,528 --> 00:27:59,475
Alternatives might be available to do that because obviously to do out that 50 feet would would change a lot of our figures, it would be quite slight, but still something that would need to be discussed.

262
00:27:59,935 --> 00:28:06,239
And I believe per the prior recommendations, a lot of that was subject to the engineers.

263
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:11,881
Reaching a satisfactory conclusion with the applicant.

264
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:16,202
So we were hoping to move forward in a similar fashion with that as well.

265
00:28:16,922 --> 00:28:21,884
I know because of our parking concerns in the prior approval.

266
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:26,127
Again, we had inadequate parking under the former regulations.

267
00:28:27,207 --> 00:28:37,115
There were a number of improvements that were requested for some crosswalks and pedestrian markings and automation systems.

268
00:28:37,735 --> 00:28:48,583
That again, I think that there was some call for some of that to remain, but I don't think it was a full request for all of it, and that was going to be a further conversation with the engineer as well.

269
00:28:57,085 --> 00:29:12,356
So I would, in summary, Chair, I don't think there's anything that we came across that would put us in a new variance or any deeper into a variance than we already have.

270
00:29:12,456 --> 00:29:16,679
I think all the issues that are there can be resolved one way or the other.

271
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:22,163
Thank you so much for your clarification.

272
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:23,544
I'm going to,

273
00:29:24,969 --> 00:29:31,772
Ask the city if you have any comments or if you want to add anything to better help the public and the board.

274
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:39,256
From your point of view.

275
00:29:42,978 --> 00:29:44,379
Oh, no, the city at this point.

276
00:29:44,619 --> 00:29:45,219
I'm sorry.

277
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:45,899
Thank you.

278
00:29:55,565 --> 00:30:02,629
The overhang that the fire chief had mentioned in this letter, was that addressed?

279
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,751
That's something I have to talk to him about.

280
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:08,032
That overhang was there originally.

281
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:12,995
And if anything, it's gotten better, more clearance.

282
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:20,480
But I think he just wants me to take him through it and try to understand it.

283
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,542
And I have all those dimensions that I can give it to him when I see him, which

284
00:30:29,905 --> 00:30:36,310
You know, I mean, you know, in Medford, the fire chief wants a lot of access in the backside and the sides of buildings.

285
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:42,034
And that's a big struggle if you don't want, you know, a lot of asphalt around your building.

286
00:30:42,114 --> 00:30:46,057
But, you know, this is no different.

287
00:30:47,498 --> 00:30:49,960
And we've done our best to comply with that request.

288
00:30:53,863 --> 00:30:58,406
And did you see the comments

289
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:15,329
from the Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion about the different treatments for signage for the handicap parking spaces.

290
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:22,396
And you'll meet all of those if we have that as a submission?

291
00:31:32,332 --> 00:31:50,125
With the signage, we usually go through the whole building and develop a signage matrix and engage a signage company to do all of that in a proper manner for compliance with the ADA, including wayfinding signs for, you know,

292
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:02,373
And there was some latches for doorways and gates.

293
00:32:03,114 --> 00:32:03,334
Yep.

294
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:11,841
We're aware of all that.

295
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:15,584
I mean, if you want to make that a condition, there's certainly no problem with that at all.

296
00:32:18,527 --> 00:32:22,230
Yeah, I believe we would be recommending carrying forward

297
00:32:22,848 --> 00:32:33,336
all relevant conditions from the last approval and then any new ones updated from higher engineering and DEI.

298
00:32:40,521 --> 00:32:41,661
That's all I have, Madam Chair.

299
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:44,063
Thank you so much, Daniel.

300
00:32:44,443 --> 00:32:51,508
One of the questions I have for clarification, previously when this was approved, there were conditions that

301
00:32:52,694 --> 00:32:56,995
we would recommend with at least six units being affordable?

302
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:59,315
Is that still on the table or has it been taken on?

303
00:33:01,736 --> 00:33:04,756
My belief, Madam Chair, is that that is ultimately up to you.

304
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:17,059
I do believe because we've added five units that it may be something that needs to be reconsidered, but that is something I believe is entirely within the purview of this board.

305
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:22,320
We're happy to, my apologies.

306
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:23,749
Go right ahead.

307
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:30,172
We're happy to engage in whatever conversations with the city that the department would like us to and oh, I see.

308
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,114
I'll defer to Director Hunt.

309
00:33:37,096 --> 00:33:40,298
Madam Chair, I believe this is subject to inclusionary zoning.

310
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:45,435
And so there's a formula, it's not a negotiation, there's a set number.

311
00:33:47,256 --> 00:33:56,924
I would have to pull open my book to get the exact formula, but that it should comply with inclusionary zoning, 80% of AMI.

312
00:33:56,944 --> 00:34:02,608
I feel that Danielle, I'm vibing her that she is looking that up as I'm saying this.

313
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:08,813
We're not in the same room, so I don't know that to be true, but I believe that she is in fact looking up the formula for us.

314
00:34:11,031 --> 00:34:24,933
And the chair, when I was first reviewing this, I believe that even though there's an increase in units, that it's still rounded up to six, I believe, but I should double check that again.

315
00:34:25,333 --> 00:34:38,736
And also since the last round of zoning changes from last month, we clarified some provisions of our inclusionary zoning requiring that

316
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:49,183
the bedrooms, that the affordable units are, you know, proportionate to the market rate ones.

317
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:52,966
So, you know, percentage of, you know, ones and twos.

318
00:34:54,688 --> 00:34:56,870
Were there any, there's no three bedrooms on this anymore, right?

319
00:34:58,291 --> 00:34:59,392
No, no threes.

320
00:35:01,994 --> 00:35:04,737
And then that they're evenly dispersed.

321
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:05,718
So,

322
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:13,835
Did you say that these would be rentals or condos?

323
00:35:15,937 --> 00:35:20,200
I believe the plan at the moment is to have rentals, correct.

324
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:35,332
Okay, before you can file for, I believe it's a building permit or you should have already started on your local initiative.

325
00:35:35,815 --> 00:35:39,817
program application to get the units on the subsidized housing inventory.

326
00:35:40,277 --> 00:35:56,184
So you'll have to go through the process of, you know, an affirmative marketing plan, getting a lottery agent on board, and getting all that and getting a regulatory agreement approved from

327
00:35:56,763 --> 00:35:58,244
the state and the city.

328
00:35:59,065 --> 00:36:02,048
And so there's some lead time involved with that.

329
00:36:02,568 --> 00:36:05,851
So we wanna make sure that you guys get a headstart on that.

330
00:36:05,891 --> 00:36:14,218
So if they're rental units, we would have the units kind of picked out in the beginning, but they're floating.

331
00:36:14,819 --> 00:36:22,546
So say someone goes over income, you don't kick them out of the unit, the next available one would be designated as affordable.

332
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,352
So they can move around a bit.

333
00:36:25,673 --> 00:36:33,122
But if they're condos, if they were to become condos, then it's a different application, a different process, and then they're fixed clearly.

334
00:36:34,464 --> 00:36:41,212
We'll confirm with the applicant and then be in touch with your office to coordinate all appropriate steps.

335
00:36:42,394 --> 00:36:42,514
OK.

336
00:37:04,813 --> 00:37:07,054
Madam chair, Emily has her hand up.

337
00:37:07,835 --> 00:37:08,075
Okay.

338
00:37:08,155 --> 00:37:08,395
Yes.

339
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:19,881
I'm going to go to the board now and I just want to remind the public at this point or actually inform the public at this point to please remain refrain from using the chat at this time.

340
00:37:19,921 --> 00:37:23,423
We're going to do a public comment period soon as we hear from the board.

341
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:24,104
Emily?

342
00:37:24,124 --> 00:37:27,546
It's just kind of a clarifying question.

343
00:37:28,783 --> 00:37:38,711
The decision that the applicants are looking for this evening, are we able to decide on that prior to the additional information and adjustments that we've spoken about this evening?

344
00:37:42,935 --> 00:37:46,758
It sounds like we still need to nail down affordable housing.

345
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:52,242
There's some department conditions that may or may not have been addressed.

346
00:37:52,763 --> 00:37:55,505
I understand we can condition some of these, but I just want to make sure we're kind of

347
00:37:56,333 --> 00:38:01,536
you know, doing right by the process and the applicant and, you know, everybody who's meeting.

348
00:38:02,857 --> 00:38:03,017
Yeah.

349
00:38:03,037 --> 00:38:10,401
And I think that's pretty much what I was trying to get a high level bullet point of is what we hit and what we haven't just to get it synthesized so that we can know.

350
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:18,705
Um, so I guess as a board, we will decide if we have enough information to continue, or if this is something that we can approve.

351
00:38:19,045 --> 00:38:24,028
I, I, I'm not sure that I'm comfortable at this point myself recommending with conditions.

352
00:38:24,128 --> 00:38:25,649
Cause I'm not sure what those conditions would be.

353
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:32,650
and what they would not be, unless the city can help us with some language.

354
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:38,673
But even then, we have to satisfy the affordable housing piece of it.

355
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:42,454
Sorry, the affordable housing is simple.

356
00:38:42,574 --> 00:38:44,835
It's 13% of the number of units.

357
00:38:45,275 --> 00:38:48,316
So I was just looking at your plans for a total number of units.

358
00:38:48,497 --> 00:38:49,097
I'll divide it by 14.

359
00:38:49,177 --> 00:38:49,097
45.

360
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:49,457
45 divided by 13.

361
00:38:49,517 --> 00:38:50,597
That's your number.

362
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,902
So you have to have three and a half units if four units must be affordable.

363
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:03,463
13% or 45.

364
00:39:03,503 --> 00:39:05,505
I think that's more than that.

365
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:11,969
I think it's six.

366
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,331
We're happy to have more than that affordable.

367
00:39:15,351 --> 00:39:17,613
I just gave it a little thought.

368
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:26,833
Yes, but by multiplying 45 units by 0.13, we end up at 5.85.

369
00:39:27,734 --> 00:39:36,198
So I think that keeps us at six units, which was the prior approval as well, or the prior recommendation as well.

370
00:39:40,321 --> 00:39:41,161
Yes, six units.

371
00:39:41,501 --> 00:39:42,662
I don't do math very well.

372
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,104
But she went to MIT, so how many,

373
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:49,106
and admit to that.

374
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:50,327
Peter?

375
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:50,487
Yes.

376
00:39:50,527 --> 00:39:51,868
Peter Kals, sorry.

377
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:55,711
Thank you, Jackie.

378
00:39:56,952 --> 00:40:03,897
Yes, I just wanted to inject my two cents into this.

379
00:40:03,937 --> 00:40:04,978
I mean, I'm trying to

380
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,410
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

381
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,850
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

382
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:16,331
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

383
00:40:16,351 --> 00:40:17,671
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

384
00:40:17,691 --> 00:40:18,891
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

385
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:20,512
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

386
00:40:20,532 --> 00:40:21,972
PB, Harmon Zuckerman.

387
00:40:39,682 --> 00:40:47,465
And it seems that the process stuff for affordable housing is just kind of like it's going to happen anyway.

388
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:51,746
So it's not really something, at least in my understanding, that we need to wait around for.

389
00:40:51,806 --> 00:40:53,466
It's just part of the process.

390
00:40:53,526 --> 00:40:56,147
It's going to happen whenever it happens.

391
00:40:56,227 --> 00:41:00,229
And it's just, it's not something we need to wait for that to happen.

392
00:41:00,289 --> 00:41:01,389
That's just going to happen.

393
00:41:09,368 --> 00:41:11,930
Peter, that was a question posed to the city.

394
00:41:14,553 --> 00:41:15,253
I believe so.

395
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:16,695
I mean, I think it's my.

396
00:41:17,335 --> 00:41:22,180
Yeah, I just want to make sure that because the way I was understanding it, I was trying to figure out if the.

397
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,823
Affordable housing and some of those procedural things.

398
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:33,791
We're not really things that we needed to condition on or wait around on, but they were just parts of the process that.

399
00:41:34,863 --> 00:41:36,805
are going to happen regardless.

400
00:41:37,125 --> 00:41:49,357
And we can condition on, say, department comments being met and those affordable housing procedural matters that Danielle was so helpful to list out.

401
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:58,066
Those are just things that are going to happen anyway, because that's what needs to happen to rent and market affordable housing.

402
00:42:01,266 --> 00:42:18,941
I think Madam Chair, Danielle has her hand up, but if I am mine, typically we would list it as a in the decision, but we would say this is subject to the city's inclusionary housing or inclusionary housing ordinance and will provide six units.

403
00:42:19,441 --> 00:42:22,284
We also would list this is subject to linkage.

404
00:42:23,149 --> 00:42:26,151
and we would list this as subject to the city's solar ordinance.

405
00:42:26,651 --> 00:42:45,981
So it's not quite a condition of the board, but we would include it in that document so that if five, 10 years later, somebody needed to refer back to it, it would be documented somewhere clearly that that was included, but we don't state it was conditioned, we just say it's subject to.

406
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:49,183
Does that answer your question?

407
00:42:50,137 --> 00:42:54,160
Yes, I mean, that's I think so it's not so much of a condition of decision.

408
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,023
It's something that would will have to be noted in the decision, but it's not really.

409
00:42:58,043 --> 00:43:03,908
A decision the board is making so much as something the board is noting along with everything else.

410
00:43:08,191 --> 00:43:12,734
For the chair, that would that would be the correct way to approach it.

411
00:43:12,934 --> 00:43:13,755
And yeah, in my opinion.

412
00:43:15,757 --> 00:43:18,519
It's a it's a condition they'll be

413
00:43:19,895 --> 00:43:22,576
You know, different times.

414
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:29,558
I'd cut off both of that.

415
00:43:29,678 --> 00:43:30,799
Sorry, I just got distracted.

416
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:31,659
Um.

417
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:38,521
Yeah, so there'll be, you know, there'll be no, no CO will be issued until.

418
00:43:39,061 --> 00:43:41,362
They have all of their units.

419
00:43:42,603 --> 00:43:45,504
Like, their regulatory agreement is approved and they're ready to.

420
00:43:47,564 --> 00:43:49,605
You'd be be marketed so.

421
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:54,485
That's why we asked that they get a head start.

422
00:43:54,525 --> 00:44:07,275
So there's no surprises because this is actually the first project that has figured our inclusionary zoning ordinance, all previous approvals of developments.

423
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:20,867
It's just been, it has been a negotiated condition of one of the boards, but this one is actually, you know, codified in our ordinance, how you meet the requirements and the,

424
00:44:23,017 --> 00:44:32,023
including how it's distributed, how many, who it's affordable to, and that'll get listed on the SHI.

425
00:44:32,043 --> 00:44:36,966
Thank you.

426
00:44:37,747 --> 00:44:39,768
Vice Chair Hedeman?

427
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:41,609
Sure.

428
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:51,596
I think Peter raised a good question and I appreciate the applicant coming forward tonight and showing us these beautiful renderings

429
00:44:52,790 --> 00:45:00,331
you know, giving us the narrative of the changes that have happened, you know, since last, this project last appeared before the board.

430
00:45:00,351 --> 00:45:12,994
I'm just a little concerned that, you know, when we brought up department comments, it seemed like those may not have been viewed or, you know, addressed in a more direct fashion.

431
00:45:13,514 --> 00:45:19,435
So, you know, while we, you know, potentially could go through each of those conditions and address them this evening,

432
00:45:20,103 --> 00:45:25,566
um, you know, absent things that are required for housing, um, building code, et cetera.

433
00:45:26,487 --> 00:45:39,355
I'm wondering if it's a more efficient use of time, um, to request the applicant returns, um, with, you know, these conditions specifically addressed within, um, their, their project.

434
00:45:43,298 --> 00:45:43,698
Adam L. Santuccii, Ph.D.:

435
00:45:43,698 --> 00:45:45,000
: Madam chair, if I may.

436
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,661
Adam L. Santuccii, Ph.D.:

437
00:45:46,661 --> 00:46:03,136
: Yes, we did receive and we did review we actually we had a meeting to discuss the the three department letters we did receive the de I letter is very, very easy for us to remedy the fire chief.

438
00:46:03,937 --> 00:46:08,620
Uh, letter, as we indicated, um, that the fire chief was unavailable for a meeting.

439
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:15,324
As he was on vacation, so we have scheduled that meeting and the engineering letter was substantially similar.

440
00:46:15,344 --> 00:46:23,689
Um, I can't say exactly so I would have to defer to Jack Sullivan on that to the, to the letter we had received last time as well.

441
00:46:23,769 --> 00:46:28,932
So our understanding being that we would satisfy the engineering office.

442
00:46:29,762 --> 00:46:37,895
with those concerns moving forward, especially given that we've reduced the parking non-conform or

443
00:46:38,688 --> 00:46:45,310
Rendered parking compliant and also reduce the number of issues that were created by the below grade parking.

444
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:51,632
But I just do want to represent that we did review the letters and we did have internal discussions on them.

445
00:46:52,533 --> 00:46:55,193
But I do understand where the board is coming from.

446
00:46:55,213 --> 00:47:02,756
I do not believe we would have had sufficient time, even to the extent we had the ability to meet with the fire chief and.

447
00:47:03,456 --> 00:47:08,641
have our engineer connect more thoroughly with the city engineer that we would have been able to update our plans.

448
00:47:09,682 --> 00:47:21,051
But we are absolutely committed to satisfying the concerns raised by each of the department heads.

449
00:47:21,131 --> 00:47:25,755
And just to echo what Attorney Barone said, I'm Jack Sullivan, the project engineer.

450
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:28,017
As far as the engineering memo, the only

451
00:47:28,715 --> 00:47:33,979
item that really we need to discuss is that corner rounding on the corner of Boston and Harvard street.

452
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,822
Um, the sidewalk goes over that corner.

453
00:47:36,862 --> 00:47:38,803
Now that's why we had proposed an easement.

454
00:47:39,464 --> 00:47:40,525
Uh, that would be a discussion.

455
00:47:40,685 --> 00:47:45,108
All the other items are more bookkeeping items and we can easily address.

456
00:47:54,696 --> 00:47:55,417
That's it on my end.

457
00:47:58,048 --> 00:47:58,568
Thank you.

458
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:02,092
And I have Stelia Kiki.

459
00:48:04,174 --> 00:48:06,215
Yeah, I have two questions.

460
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:15,024
The first is what measures are in place to address the traffic safety concerns coming in and out of the building, especially that the streets are busy.

461
00:48:15,904 --> 00:48:22,010
And then the next question is in regards to the commercial area, is there a designated drop off, pick up area?

462
00:48:23,211 --> 00:48:24,212
How are we dealing with it?

463
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:27,849
Sure.

464
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:37,432
So with the traffic situation, we do have one egress and ingress, which is shown on the on the right side of the plan.

465
00:48:38,593 --> 00:48:45,835
We set that as far back from the corner as possible for the purpose of allowing for adequate ingress and egress.

466
00:48:45,855 --> 00:48:48,716
And that is a full 24 wide drive aisle.

467
00:48:48,736 --> 00:48:53,378
So we do have a full two way traffic ability to pull up

468
00:48:53,898 --> 00:48:55,200
Check both directions.

469
00:48:56,021 --> 00:48:58,684
Fortunately, we are on the side where traffic is.

470
00:48:59,325 --> 00:49:02,648
We're not going to be crossing traffic to necessarily head into town.

471
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:04,110
But.

472
00:49:05,992 --> 00:49:11,719
The point is well understood, and we do know that there were some requests in the engineering.

473
00:49:14,141 --> 00:49:19,985
letter relative to some improvements being made to crosswalks, an additional crosswalk.

474
00:49:20,065 --> 00:49:21,827
They also requested certain signage.

475
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:42,482
Also, one thing I do want to note was that the update to our traffic study did indicate that we should have a decrease in trips if I recall correctly, but allow me to confirm that before I make that firm statement.

476
00:49:43,955 --> 00:50:00,922
But we did try to mitigate any traffic concerns as much as possible again by setting our ingress and egress as wide as we could in the location that we did and setting our overhang back a little closer to the building than it previously was.

477
00:50:01,862 --> 00:50:05,043
Now we won't be coming up a ramp, fortunately, into a blind

478
00:50:07,245 --> 00:50:18,233
Entrance here will have a better gauge of the, or I should say motorists will have a better gauge of traffic on the sidewalk as well as traffic in the street and have adequate time to stop as well.

479
00:50:18,313 --> 00:50:21,896
Pedestrians have better sightline of the vehicles.

480
00:50:24,258 --> 00:50:27,080
As far as the commercial space goes.

481
00:50:30,591 --> 00:50:32,933
I do not know if we have designated drop-off.

482
00:50:32,993 --> 00:50:44,404
I think our primary concern here was that we did have space both along Boston Avenue as well as Harvard Street to allow for a drop-off.

483
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:54,353
But as mentioned, we do have significant bike parking and means for pedestrian and bicyclists to access the facility as well.

484
00:51:02,590 --> 00:51:05,791
Thank you, Attorney Barone.

485
00:51:06,351 --> 00:51:08,632
Are you all set, Sally or Kiki?

486
00:51:10,613 --> 00:51:12,414
Yep, yeah, it's answered my question.

487
00:51:13,014 --> 00:51:13,454
Okay.

488
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:14,775
Peter Cowles?

489
00:51:17,216 --> 00:51:17,876
Thank you, Madam Chair.

490
00:51:17,956 --> 00:51:28,940
I just would like to confirm going back to the discussion about the department head conditions that the applicant has received and reviewed the

491
00:51:31,678 --> 00:51:51,604
department conditions and with the exception partially of the rounding at the corner is prepared to comply with the department conditions just so we can get a clear statement on where the conditions and the applicants stand.

492
00:51:56,026 --> 00:51:59,067
I will defer to Jack on that.

493
00:51:59,455 --> 00:51:59,615
Yeah.

494
00:51:59,755 --> 00:52:09,601
So as far as the engineering memo dated September 20th, um, we will comply with all the recommendations from the city engineer.

495
00:52:10,021 --> 00:52:14,103
Um, as I said, item number one on the rounding, we'll have to have some discussion on that.

496
00:52:14,444 --> 00:52:15,764
We'd like to give an easement.

497
00:52:16,645 --> 00:52:27,531
Because in that case, we don't change the overall lot area as attorney Brown stated, since some of the, uh, dimensional requirements, even though they'd be slightly adjusted, they would be adjusted.

498
00:52:28,491 --> 00:52:31,614
but we do want to give a right to that rounding to the city.

499
00:52:32,635 --> 00:52:36,458
We're hoping to do that in the form of an easement, but there'll have to be some discussion on that.

500
00:52:36,498 --> 00:52:39,361
But all the other items were amenable to.

501
00:52:39,381 --> 00:52:41,002
Okay, great.

502
00:52:41,162 --> 00:52:41,443
Thank you.

503
00:52:41,543 --> 00:52:42,744
Just wanted to make that clear.

504
00:52:43,920 --> 00:53:09,462
And Madam Chair, if I may as well back to board member Akiki's question relative to traffic in the transportation comments to the engineer letter, there is reference here that due to a change in standards for estimating trips that our traffic study did correctly estimate that trips would actually decrease compared to the prior proposal.

505
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:16,721
Thank you, Attorney Barone.

506
00:53:16,741 --> 00:53:18,343
Board Member Sherrod Baracharia.

507
00:53:25,229 --> 00:53:26,630
You're on mute, Sherrod.

508
00:53:31,254 --> 00:53:32,735
Thank you, Madam Chair.

509
00:53:33,556 --> 00:53:39,661
I think it was mentioned that there is a high water table at this location and you have also lowered the basement height.

510
00:53:40,432 --> 00:53:48,014
I'm just wondering what your mitigator water levels here and if you have made any changes to the drainage system.

511
00:53:50,334 --> 00:53:53,255
Yes, I can answer that, Chair.

512
00:53:54,775 --> 00:53:55,576
We have no basement.

513
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:58,816
We eliminated it by doing this scheme.

514
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:01,877
So we are completely out of the water table.

515
00:54:01,897 --> 00:54:04,758
The water table turned out to be about four feet below grade.

516
00:54:06,818 --> 00:54:10,139
And an original test that we have done in our early planning

517
00:54:13,177 --> 00:54:19,781
So it changed quite radically after the wall was built by the MBTA.

518
00:54:19,941 --> 00:54:28,886
So I can say that the foundation that we now have is very conventional.

519
00:54:29,226 --> 00:54:37,090
It's not going to be needing ballasting or waterproofing or anything like that, other than normal measures that are taken.

520
00:54:39,432 --> 00:54:41,953
And just to piggyback on what Peter added,

521
00:54:43,163 --> 00:54:45,304
We are having a drainage system put in.

522
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:52,951
We're going to collect the entire roof area of the building, and it'll go into a drainage infiltration field under the parking lot in the rear.

523
00:54:54,152 --> 00:55:00,959
We have an overall reduction of 2,500 square feet, plus or minus of impervious surfaces already on this project.

524
00:55:00,999 --> 00:55:09,166
So there's an overall reduction in impervious surfaces, but we're also providing the drainage system, as I noted.

525
00:55:09,808 --> 00:55:16,034
And we did provide a detailed stormwater report to the city engineer on our stormwater design.

526
00:55:16,054 --> 00:55:25,623
I would just add, I guess it goes without saying that current use is 100%, nearly 100% impervious asphalt and building.

527
00:55:25,923 --> 00:55:27,244
It just drains off the site.

528
00:55:33,791 --> 00:55:34,451
Okay, thank you.

529
00:55:38,283 --> 00:55:40,344
Are there any further questions from the board?

530
00:55:40,364 --> 00:55:48,427
Okay, I'm going to open up the public comment period.

531
00:55:48,948 --> 00:55:52,369
I see that there was some activity in the chat, but we're unable to use that.

532
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:59,412
Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message among Danielle in the comments.

533
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:03,732
You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

534
00:56:04,293 --> 00:56:06,654
Individuals may have up to two minutes to provide comments.

535
00:56:06,714 --> 00:56:09,876
Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

536
00:56:10,436 --> 00:56:17,780
Just another reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

537
00:56:18,521 --> 00:56:25,885
However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and city staff.

538
00:56:26,687 --> 00:56:31,051
Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

539
00:56:35,275 --> 00:56:43,242
Yes, I don't believe that we received written comment on this proposed amendment.

540
00:56:45,304 --> 00:56:51,190
If there's anybody on the meeting right now that wishes to comment, could you use the raise hand function?

541
00:56:53,558 --> 00:57:00,423
Scrolling this, a lot of attendees right now, so I'm trying to scroll through and see if there's anyone that wishes to comment.

542
00:57:01,603 --> 00:57:04,405
Again, I did see some comments in the chat.

543
00:57:08,028 --> 00:57:11,090
I could, there's Patricia Berry.

544
00:57:12,631 --> 00:57:20,616
Visitor parking for the building, handicap parking for building, entrance and exit issues from parking area and flow into busy Boston Ave traffic with lights at corner.

545
00:57:25,932 --> 00:57:26,232
Ms.

546
00:57:26,272 --> 00:57:29,054
Barry, if you wanted to elaborate on that.

547
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:32,957
You can unmute yourself.

548
00:57:35,479 --> 00:57:38,041
If not, I think I think that was addressed.

549
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:38,942
Yes.

550
00:57:39,642 --> 00:57:42,004
Hi, Patricia Barry, 5 Taylor Street, Medford.

551
00:57:44,834 --> 00:57:57,000
I guess my concerns are having lived in Medford all my life and off of Boston Ave and do frequent this part of Boston Ave periodically.

552
00:57:57,901 --> 00:58:08,667
The congestion of the traffic flow between Harvard Street and Boston Ave at various times of the day can be rather heavily congested.

553
00:58:09,547 --> 00:58:26,501
With traffic, especially coming up from the parkway where there is already mega construction going on or planned for that area for the medical labs building to go in is also.

554
00:58:26,521 --> 00:58:26,701
Projected.

555
00:58:30,094 --> 00:58:54,976
increase of the Cummings high-rises at 200 Boston Ave with the lights at this intersection and trying to go down Boston Ave and take from Boston Ave at Tufts and taking a left into this one egress in and out of the parking lot.

556
00:58:55,697 --> 00:59:05,875
With the traffic lights flowing and the amount of traffic that can be there at any given point during the day, not just that heavy rush hour times.

557
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:17,624
That is going to cause a huge backup in traffic flow if someone's attempting to get into their own residence at this place.

558
00:59:18,904 --> 00:59:21,186
That's one of the key concerns.

559
00:59:22,366 --> 00:59:35,053
The affordable housing you've responded to, and I guess overall traffic is more of a concern than anything else.

560
00:59:36,033 --> 00:59:41,336
uh, for me, um, being a resident of the Boston Ave area.

561
00:59:44,858 --> 00:59:48,260
How do you reflect on, you know, responding to that issue?

562
00:59:50,202 --> 00:59:50,802
Absolutely.

563
00:59:51,042 --> 01:00:03,469
And, um, we had submitted with our initial, uh, application a traffic impact study, uh, and with our most recent request for modification, an updated, uh,

564
01:00:05,873 --> 01:00:09,015
calculation of trip generation based upon the new proposal.

565
01:00:09,676 --> 01:00:19,163
And on table two on page four, which I don't know if that's readily available, I can try to share my screen if possible.

566
01:00:19,524 --> 01:00:34,775
But ultimately, the current gas station has significantly greater weekday and Saturday daily trips compared to the trips or the trip generation coming in and out of this

567
01:00:35,856 --> 01:00:58,357
facility and to that extent we see a significant decrease in morning hours, evening hours, as well as midday on Saturday to the point where per the traffic study our weekday daily with the existing gas station is estimated 722 trips and our proposed mixed use trips would be 170.

568
01:01:00,498 --> 01:01:08,823
On our Saturday daily, the existing Titan gas station is north of 1000 trips, whereas our proposed mixed use would be under 200.

569
01:01:10,324 --> 01:01:17,729
So, while we completely understand the concerns we are relying on this study.

570
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:30,734
evidencing that the traffic in and out of this building will be significantly less when it's limited to 45 units as opposed to a use that relies upon regular vehicular traffic in and out of the lot for gas station and car wash purposes.

571
01:01:32,394 --> 01:01:47,100
If I may add to the chair, the current layout with the car wash is basically an open curve around most of the two sides of the site so that cars can come and go

572
01:01:47,853 --> 01:01:57,663
in a number of locations, whereas in our case, we are limiting it to one curb cut at the far end of the site, as far away from the intersection as possible.

573
01:01:58,444 --> 01:02:00,807
So I think it's a great improvement actually.

574
01:02:05,712 --> 01:02:05,992
Thank you.

575
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:22,932
And I'm not sure you're waiting for more public comment.

576
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:25,494
Yeah, I just want to make sure Ms.

577
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:26,795
Barry was all set.

578
01:02:26,835 --> 01:02:35,320
I know there was another question regarding handicap accessibility that was not included in the DEI's letter.

579
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:36,281
Ms.

580
01:02:36,321 --> 01:02:38,542
Barry, are you okay with that?

581
01:02:38,562 --> 01:02:39,303
Yes.

582
01:02:39,403 --> 01:02:43,306
How much, well, one more in regards to the parking.

583
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:50,485
Is there enough substantial visitor parking allocated in the residential area?

584
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:59,673
Are people expect to ride their bikes to visit people in these units or to depend upon the green line usage?

585
01:03:01,025 --> 01:03:07,290
So, we, we provided the amount of parking that was required by the code.

586
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:23,882
And when we first approached, or first appeared before this board back in 2020, before there was the change in the code, we'd actually provided more parking that was not actually adequate for the current regulations at that time.

587
01:03:24,942 --> 01:03:38,230
And at that time, there were concerns among the board, and they were voiced as well at the zoning board, that even the parking that was required was going to be too much, and the amount that we provided would potentially be more than was necessary.

588
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:52,157
So, with that in mind, we did rely heavily on the Green Line extension, pedestrian and bicycle traffic, and then met the required amount of parking under the ordinance.

589
01:03:55,160 --> 01:04:13,216
whether all of those spots are used by residents or some of them are used by visitors is less so within our purview and more just us complying with what the city is requesting, as well as, as I mentioned, providing a significant amount of bicycle parking.

590
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:17,059
Can someone enlighten me as to what is

591
01:04:19,113 --> 01:04:26,547
The standard, the city standard as to visitor per unit expectation.

592
01:04:34,169 --> 01:04:40,193
So, my, my understanding of the code is that it is less a visitor per unit.

593
01:04:40,693 --> 01:04:47,618
And parking is determined on a basis of both afforded proposed affordability units.

594
01:04:48,318 --> 01:04:54,162
As well as as well as proximity to.

595
01:04:54,182 --> 01:04:54,242
I, I.

596
01:04:57,969 --> 01:04:59,773
Transit, I'm sorry, mass transit.

597
01:05:00,474 --> 01:05:09,010
So, to that extent, those are the calculations I don't have those immediately handy in front of me to tell you exactly how we reach the number we did.

598
01:05:10,180 --> 01:05:12,561
but I can certainly look into that.

599
01:05:12,601 --> 01:05:16,463
But again, it is on a per lot basis.

600
01:05:16,643 --> 01:05:23,706
It's no longer, at least based upon our location, tied to visitor versus resident parking.

601
01:05:24,127 --> 01:05:26,148
And perhaps Ms.

602
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:30,470
Evans could provide a little further detail on that.

603
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:32,591
I don't know if that's why you're raising your hand, I'm sorry.

604
01:05:35,152 --> 01:05:36,692
Yes, through the chair.

605
01:05:38,406 --> 01:05:56,079
Yeah, our parking requirements are based on the units and the assumption is that, you know, some people may have more cars, some people may have no cars and, you know, it all kind of like balances out, but there isn't additional parking required for visitors.

606
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:04,865
I don't know, will the parking be assigned to units or will there be, will you be,

607
01:06:05,386 --> 01:06:27,167
will it be included with the unit's rent, or will it be something that folks could, if you don't need parking, then you don't have to pay for it, or sometimes there's extra parking that's not coupled with the unit, then that could be freed up for visitors if needed.

608
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:40,469
Sure, I don't believe we've gotten that far along to confirm whether we will be again I think it's also related to whether this is going to be condominiums or apartments.

609
01:06:41,871 --> 01:06:51,479
I think that that conversation is going to be more relevant once we understand that the project is moving forward, but we can we can.

610
01:06:52,997 --> 01:06:57,480
confirm or at least hypothesize how that might go.

611
01:06:58,061 --> 01:07:00,723
But at this time, I don't have a firm answer for you on that.

612
01:07:12,071 --> 01:07:13,151
Thank you, Attorney Broome.

613
01:07:13,171 --> 01:07:14,232
You're welcome.

614
01:07:16,214 --> 01:07:19,656
Danielle, do you see any other public comments or Ms.

615
01:07:19,676 --> 01:07:20,977
Barry, are you all set?

616
01:07:24,151 --> 01:07:31,496
I do not see any additional folks with raised hands or anything in the chat.

617
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:35,918
Okay.

618
01:07:36,098 --> 01:07:51,368
I'm going to close the public comment period and come back to the board at this time to see if there's any other clarifying questions or if there's anything that you want to ask of the city or the applicant.

619
01:07:55,643 --> 01:07:56,745
Any members of the board.

620
01:07:58,227 --> 01:07:58,888
Yes, me.

621
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:02,673
I sorry, I can't see.

622
01:08:03,173 --> 01:08:04,756
Fishman.

623
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:06,731
Hi, Ari.

624
01:08:07,072 --> 01:08:07,392
Sorry.

625
01:08:07,992 --> 01:08:08,833
Go right ahead.

626
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:16,017
So there was a question in the chat that hadn't been followed up with that I'd like to enter as my own question.

627
01:08:16,957 --> 01:08:23,961
Are any of the affordable units being designated as accessible or any of the other units being built?

628
01:08:24,021 --> 01:08:29,645
I know that it sounds like there are a lot of details you don't know yet, but I was curious about the answer to that.

629
01:08:29,665 --> 01:08:33,747
I can answer that through the chair.

630
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:35,108
Yeah, so all of the

631
01:08:35,589 --> 01:08:50,499
units have at least the minimal requirements for clearances and adaptability that is required under the Massachusetts regulations for accessibility.

632
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:59,685
Two of the units will be what they call group 2A units, which are completely fitted out for handicap accessibility.

633
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:06,401
two will also be set up for hearing impaired as well.

634
01:09:07,142 --> 01:09:11,505
So there's quite a bit that goes into these buildings that, you know, will address that.

635
01:09:11,645 --> 01:09:15,889
All of the building is handicap accessible from one end to the other.

636
01:09:16,509 --> 01:09:21,433
There's no, there's no, no exceptions there.

637
01:09:23,635 --> 01:09:23,915
Thank you.

638
01:09:33,663 --> 01:09:38,706
I think it's a, see where the board is at now for deliberations.

639
01:09:38,906 --> 01:09:47,230
Are you all comfortable with moving forward with the recommendation to the ZBA or are we looking to table this?

640
01:09:47,330 --> 01:10:00,816
I think some of the, a lot of the questions that I had was the previous conditions for myself and where they stood, but we've already heard from the applicant that they're willing to comply as necessary with all

641
01:10:03,201 --> 01:10:07,703
department had comments and then the process of affordability I can be handled with.

642
01:10:07,743 --> 01:10:15,166
So I'm confident in handling that with the city, but I want to know what other board members are feeling at this time.

643
01:10:17,406 --> 01:10:21,068
Go ahead, Peter.

644
01:10:21,648 --> 01:10:25,089
I'm sorry, Mr. Quinn, I think, are you sharing your screen?

645
01:10:25,129 --> 01:10:29,891
If you could stop sharing.

646
01:10:30,271 --> 01:10:31,072
Thank you so much.

647
01:10:31,212 --> 01:10:31,532
Thank you.

648
01:10:37,633 --> 01:11:04,548
I think having heard that the applicant is prepared to comply with the department comments, particularly the engineering and transportation comments of the memo dated 9-20, that at least I'm comfortable going ahead with that seeing that they, I mean, we will have to know in our decision that

649
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:21,907
note that there's a plot that the affordability conditions that, as Director Hunt said earlier, that this will be, this will be, this will, linkage will apply to this and so on and so forth.

650
01:11:23,267 --> 01:11:36,110
But as long as I think we make sure we include all that condition on the department comments, which it seems the applicant is willing to do, that I would be comfortable moving this forward.

651
01:11:41,734 --> 01:11:48,239
as am I. Yeah, me too, Sally.

652
01:11:51,722 --> 01:12:04,472
Okay, so because we're making advisory recommendations, I guess at this point, I wanna be clear, Danielle, we are going with the previous conditions as well as a couple of new conditions, correct?

653
01:12:06,094 --> 01:12:10,357
If the city wants to help us get this language proper so that someone can even

654
01:12:10,783 --> 01:12:12,965
Peter, are you able to capture conditions?

655
01:12:14,686 --> 01:12:16,167
I'm working on that right now.

656
01:12:16,327 --> 01:12:16,647
Okay.

657
01:12:20,951 --> 01:12:39,124
Yes, so I know that some of the original conditions, some may not be relevant, but I know we wanted to keep

658
01:12:40,213 --> 01:13:09,895
the traffic mitigation conditions from the previous approval, as well as the additional condition that Director Blake had added about the, sorry, I usually have more than one screen, so I'm struggling here.

659
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,947
toggling between different tabs.

660
01:13:15,989 --> 01:13:36,699
So in your meeting packet, there was the previous recommendation from your board dated June 22nd, 2020, which had the additional conditions about purchase and install countdown pedestrian signals,

661
01:13:38,593 --> 01:13:39,614
Let's see.

662
01:13:40,254 --> 01:13:42,016
So yeah.

663
01:13:44,678 --> 01:13:52,064
And then that the proponent at this point, number three may be mute because the proponents should work with the city engineer to provide the additional information.

664
01:13:52,164 --> 01:13:55,988
At this point, it's working with the city engineer as well as the fire chief.

665
01:13:56,148 --> 01:14:00,932
But I thought that was all encompassing with number four, which is compliance with recommendations.

666
01:14:01,828 --> 01:14:03,429
to the satisfaction of each department.

667
01:14:03,790 --> 01:14:06,172
So I want to make sure that we're fleshing out everything.

668
01:14:06,732 --> 01:14:12,997
Because if we're going to discuss each department head, it should be all inclusive, unless.

669
01:14:13,017 --> 01:14:26,328
Yeah, I think we could, yeah, probably, yeah, strike three.

670
01:14:29,847 --> 01:14:33,529
Because I think four is sufficient.

671
01:14:34,429 --> 01:14:44,374
And we can update those with the new dates.

672
01:14:46,154 --> 01:14:46,435
Yes.

673
01:14:46,875 --> 01:14:49,436
That's what I was going to ask.

674
01:14:49,496 --> 01:14:50,416
I've been writing.

675
01:14:50,436 --> 01:14:52,897
I've been trying to put together conditions.

676
01:14:52,918 --> 01:14:58,100
And we would be talking about the two, that the applicant shall comply with the

677
01:14:58,648 --> 01:15:16,621
DEI memo dated 9-21-23, the Fire Department memo dated 9-19-23, and the Transportation Engineering memo dated 9-20-23, which are the department head comments for this most recent, in the run-up to this most recent meeting.

678
01:15:18,002 --> 01:15:25,307
And I believe that was a combined memo from City Engineer and- Yes, Transportation and Engineering shared a memo.

679
01:15:29,591 --> 01:15:37,896
And then I believe Marianne O'Connor's previous memo still applies.

680
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:39,357
I don't think she had any updates.

681
01:15:41,398 --> 01:15:45,420
Yes, that is what I was going to ask, just as I'm trying to capture conditions here.

682
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:57,367
How do we want to term including the conditions of the previous approval of June 2020?

683
01:16:05,383 --> 01:16:11,086
because I presume there are still some terms of that approval that we want to carry through, even if some other things have changed.

684
01:16:11,547 --> 01:16:17,050
Madam Chair, I'm looking, this is Director Hunt, I'm looking at the previous approval.

685
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:19,711
It actually listed four items.

686
01:16:21,352 --> 01:16:22,733
So it's pretty straightforward.

687
01:16:23,073 --> 01:16:29,877
The first one is the incorporation of option R3 to purchase, install, countdown, pedestrian signal heads.

688
01:16:30,487 --> 01:16:35,430
for the intersection of Boston Avenue and Harvard Street from the engineering divisions letter.

689
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:41,353
I assume that particular item you can just carry forward exactly as it's written.

690
01:16:44,134 --> 01:16:49,797
And then the item number two was installation of a solar energy system in compliance with the city's solar ordinance.

691
01:16:50,437 --> 01:16:52,858
That is one that I would actually say goes without saying.

692
01:16:52,918 --> 01:16:54,940
I would actually not include that as a condition.

693
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:59,662
I would list that as the list of complying with the city's ordinances including.

694
01:17:00,816 --> 01:17:08,724
Um, and the third one was the proponent should work with the city engineer to provide the additional information requested in his letter of June 17th.

695
01:17:09,144 --> 01:17:12,047
Since that that's the piece that we believe is complete, right?

696
01:17:12,087 --> 01:17:13,388
They, they've worked with that.

697
01:17:13,448 --> 01:17:16,531
We have a new, uh, engineering letter.

698
01:17:17,492 --> 01:17:17,732
Yes.

699
01:17:17,813 --> 01:17:25,500
And so, and that, and so instead of piecing, parsing that out to be its own item, it should be, um, all inclusive and number four for all department heads.

700
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:31,914
Compliance with recommendations to the satisfaction of each department head in the letters and then listing the letters.

701
01:17:32,834 --> 01:17:48,805
So it's actually one of the simpler ones that we've seen with the countdown pedestrian signal head was the only thing that was called out that wasn't comply with the letters attached or with city ordinances.

702
01:17:50,726 --> 01:17:55,209
So then we would add into the decision and compliance with the city ordinances of linkage

703
01:17:56,120 --> 01:18:00,442
Uh, and sorry, inclusionary housing and the solar ordinance.

704
01:18:01,203 --> 01:18:03,944
Honestly, they have to comply with all city ordinances.

705
01:18:04,024 --> 01:18:13,869
We just feel that it's nicer to call those out so that none of them are a surprise because those are Medford specific as opposed to building code.

706
01:18:17,951 --> 01:18:21,553
Also, in terms of the countdown pedestrian signal that is included

707
01:18:22,618 --> 01:18:26,560
In the translation memo from 920 that's that's.

708
01:18:29,622 --> 01:18:32,284
So, I don't know that it needs to be called out separately.

709
01:18:32,304 --> 01:18:40,988
I wonder if it was as simply a. Convenience for when we are doing monitoring later.

710
01:18:41,909 --> 01:18:48,933
When there's something like that, that we have to check and make sure it got installed that that would be the only reason I could imagine we, we called it out separately.

711
01:18:55,501 --> 01:19:04,044
Yes, so through the chair, I think at this point, it would be like any kind of like special conditions that are not already required by the ordinance.

712
01:19:04,164 --> 01:19:22,632
And when it gets to the zoning board where they have their decision, we will have the whole laundry list of conditions, our standard boiler plate for the different complying with the different provisions of the ordinance.

713
01:19:26,352 --> 01:19:26,972
the comments.

714
01:19:36,254 --> 01:19:41,595
And so as far as Gordon, that just, that also covers inclusionary housing at this point.

715
01:19:41,935 --> 01:19:53,997
Um, that was called out separately originally, but it should just be compliant with the city as necessary because it's mandatory and not necessarily a condition.

716
01:20:12,476 --> 01:20:16,219
At this point, is it time for one of us to motion for a vote?

717
01:20:16,759 --> 01:20:29,869
So yeah, so we're looking for a motion to recommend that the Board of Appeals approves the special permit for the site plan review for 590 Boston Ave with the following conditions.

718
01:20:30,210 --> 01:20:30,690
Go Peter.

719
01:20:33,392 --> 01:20:36,574
Alright, and Danielle, feel free to let me know if I left anything off.

720
01:20:36,594 --> 01:20:37,275
To.

721
01:20:43,398 --> 01:21:04,116
comply with all city ordinances, specifically inclusionary housing ordinance and the and the residential linkage to comply with all

722
01:21:04,925 --> 01:21:14,874
Department head comments as stated in the DEI department memo of 9-21-2023, the fire department memo of 9-19-2023, and the transportation and engineering department memos of 9-20-2023.

723
01:21:14,994 --> 01:21:16,135
And I believe that's all I have.

724
01:21:31,305 --> 01:21:36,706
unless I missed how exactly we were calling out the previous approval.

725
01:21:40,147 --> 01:21:48,129
And if the city does not have anything to add on that language, we can go ahead and who wants to do the first motion?

726
01:21:49,150 --> 01:21:57,912
Recommending approval of the amendment to the site plan review

727
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:03,353
Yes, that's the one key word I left out was amendment.

728
01:22:03,453 --> 01:22:06,335
I originally said to recommend that the Board of Appeals approves.

729
01:22:06,876 --> 01:22:14,102
So we're recommending that the Board of Appeals approves the amended special permit.

730
01:22:14,482 --> 01:22:15,063
Is that what it is?

731
01:22:16,604 --> 01:22:18,085
Well, it's site plan review.

732
01:22:18,145 --> 01:22:19,426
It's not a special permit.

733
01:22:19,546 --> 01:22:24,391
It used to be a special permit, but it's just site plan review.

734
01:22:26,652 --> 01:22:28,294
They were the site plan review authority.

735
01:22:29,315 --> 01:22:33,037
originally, so for the amendment, just keep it with that original authority.

736
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:35,018
Okay.

737
01:22:36,499 --> 01:22:37,160
I so move.

738
01:22:40,882 --> 01:22:42,042
Is there a second?

739
01:22:42,663 --> 01:22:43,603
I second, Sally.

740
01:22:47,385 --> 01:22:48,726
Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

741
01:22:50,607 --> 01:22:52,188
I'm just going to abstain from this one.

742
01:22:52,268 --> 01:22:52,788
That's all right.

743
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:57,451
Peter Cowles?

744
01:22:58,472 --> 01:22:58,672
Yes.

745
01:23:00,983 --> 01:23:01,704
Ari Fishman?

746
01:23:07,687 --> 01:23:08,448
Ari froze up.

747
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:12,631
Oh, yes.

748
01:23:13,091 --> 01:23:13,591
Can you hear me?

749
01:23:14,152 --> 01:23:14,412
Yes.

750
01:23:15,333 --> 01:23:16,213
Pam Marianski?

751
01:23:16,814 --> 01:23:17,074
Yes.

752
01:23:18,575 --> 01:23:19,395
Sally Akiki?

753
01:23:20,536 --> 01:23:20,856
Yes.

754
01:23:22,037 --> 01:23:23,058
Sharad Bharacharya?

755
01:23:24,258 --> 01:23:24,559
Yes.

756
01:23:25,339 --> 01:23:26,720
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

757
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:27,240
I'm a yes.

758
01:23:27,581 --> 01:23:28,541
So that carries.

759
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:36,020
6, 6, 1, the motion carries.

760
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:37,881
Thank you very much.

761
01:23:37,921 --> 01:23:39,441
We really appreciate your time this evening.

762
01:23:39,901 --> 01:23:40,421
Thank you.

763
01:23:40,441 --> 01:23:41,922
Have a great evening.

764
01:23:42,602 --> 01:23:43,282
You as well.

765
01:23:43,923 --> 01:23:44,303
Thank you.

766
01:23:45,103 --> 01:23:45,823
Thank you very much.

767
01:23:52,865 --> 01:23:54,306
So, our next item.

768
01:23:57,127 --> 01:24:00,108
Plan development district 1 and 3 to 21 point court.

769
01:24:03,094 --> 01:24:06,235
This is a public hearing, and I will read accordingly.

770
01:24:06,936 --> 01:24:28,585
The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on October 4th, 2023 at 6.30 PM via Zoom, remote video conferencing, relative to paper number 23-407, a petition by the Medford Housing Authority to amend zoning map, City of Medford maps dated April 13th, 1965, as referenced in the Medford zoning ordinance, chapter 94-2.2.

771
01:24:30,820 --> 01:24:56,647
The amendment proposes to change the zoning district designation of the property one and the three to 20 Walkland Court as depicted on sheets one to six of the plans entitled ALTA slash NSPS land title survey prepared by Fuston O'Neill and dated February 6, 2022 from apartment one zoning district to plan development district, which would have new development standards per Memphis zoning ordinance chapter 94-9.2.3.

772
01:25:03,743 --> 01:25:06,705
Danielle, do you want me to take it from here?

773
01:25:06,725 --> 01:25:13,230
Do you want me to keep going or do you want me to give an overview?

774
01:25:13,411 --> 01:25:14,652
Whatever pleases the board.

775
01:25:16,033 --> 01:25:25,100
I will say, just of note, a subsequent public hearing on the same matter will be held on the Medford City Council on November 14th, 2023 at 7 p.m.

776
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:29,043
in the Medford City Council Chamber on the second floor of Medford City Hall.

777
01:25:30,106 --> 01:25:32,967
85 George P. Hassett Drive, Mesquite Mass, and via Zoom.

778
01:25:33,247 --> 01:25:37,068
A link to the public hearing will be posted no later than November 10th, 2023.

779
01:25:41,130 --> 01:25:42,890
Okay, Danielle, I apologize.

780
01:25:45,311 --> 01:25:51,793
Do you wanna give a background on the PV or I can avoid adding the process?

781
01:25:53,053 --> 01:25:54,734
Yeah, I'm just fighting with the tabs.

782
01:25:55,054 --> 01:25:56,154
Sorry for my delay.

783
01:25:56,174 --> 01:25:56,975
Yeah, so,

784
01:26:00,595 --> 01:26:04,917
To remind folks where we are in the process as we've had, you know, several PDDs coming through.

785
01:26:04,937 --> 01:26:08,918
So there's the three steps for the PDD.

786
01:26:09,319 --> 01:26:16,902
The first is the zoning drafting phase, which is what the Community Development Board did on September 6th.

787
01:26:17,762 --> 01:26:27,226
And the draft was presented to you all, which was developed with

788
01:26:28,916 --> 01:26:34,700
in conjunction with the applicant, city staff, and our legal counsel that we retained.

789
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,723
And you all voted to submit that to the city council.

790
01:26:40,743 --> 01:26:51,990
And that went to them, and that starts the official statutory zoning amendment process.

791
01:26:52,390 --> 01:26:55,092
And then so they immediately refer it back to

792
01:26:55,847 --> 01:26:56,948
you all tonight.

793
01:26:57,008 --> 01:27:00,730
So this is the second part of it.

794
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:15,538
So you would be making a recommendation on language for the amendment to go back to the city council who would vote on it, and it's on their agenda for November 14th.

795
01:27:16,138 --> 01:27:18,439
Although they are the ones that approve

796
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:28,106
The ordinance, they can't actually act on it unless they get a recommendation from you or the 35 days 35 days will last.

797
01:27:29,067 --> 01:27:40,396
And if it is approved at City Council, then that doesn't actually approve the project that just approves the plan development district and then they have.

798
01:27:42,250 --> 01:27:53,657
period of time, I believe it's two years, to apply for a plan development special permit to actually do the project.

799
01:27:53,737 --> 01:27:57,500
And the special permit branding authority is city council for that.

800
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:04,104
And then this would also be subject to site plan review, and that can be done concurrently or separately.

801
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:14,730
Thank you, Danielle.

802
01:28:15,850 --> 01:28:23,792
So we have attorney Jonathan Silverstein of BBHS Law, retained by the city of Medford and is available as support and counsel for the board.

803
01:28:24,152 --> 01:28:26,553
He will assist the board in making any revisions to the amendment.

804
01:28:27,273 --> 01:28:29,873
Board members should feel free to ask questions.

805
01:28:30,434 --> 01:28:41,396
We now ask the applicant for Walkman Court to introduce themselves and present their proposal, mainly highlighting and pointing out the differences of what that will include of what's allowed there.

806
01:28:43,241 --> 01:28:47,043
um, what's there now and what will be allowed there for the PDD.

807
01:28:48,223 --> 01:28:51,424
Danielle, do you want to introduce, um, the applicant?

808
01:28:54,726 --> 01:28:56,166
I believe, let's see who we have.

809
01:28:56,847 --> 01:29:00,568
Um, attorney Hannah Kilson is representing them.

810
01:29:00,728 --> 01:29:11,693
And I believe, um, we have Natalie Jansen from the Cambridge Housing Authority who is consulting, uh, for the, um, Medford Housing Authority.

811
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:17,014
as well as Karsten Snow and see who else.

812
01:29:17,034 --> 01:29:17,774
There's a lot of them.

813
01:29:18,214 --> 01:29:20,817
We might want them to introduce themselves.

814
01:29:20,837 --> 01:29:24,019
There's our architect team, there's Gabe Ciccariello.

815
01:29:26,261 --> 01:29:28,242
So we have a full house here.

816
01:29:28,543 --> 01:29:32,426
Well, if you have a presentation, you can introduce yourself as you go along.

817
01:29:32,506 --> 01:29:33,086
We will do that.

818
01:29:38,242 --> 01:29:43,809
Natalie you're going to all right now he's going to share the screen but good evening madam chair members of the board.

819
01:29:43,829 --> 01:29:46,092
I'm very nice to see you all again.

820
01:29:46,713 --> 01:29:52,440
My name is Gabe Chikarello I'm the director of modernization and procurement with the Medford housing authority.

821
01:29:54,143 --> 01:30:07,374
this evening to discuss our PDD 3 zoning amendment, which would allow for the redevelopment of Walkman Court in accordance with the City of Medford's comprehensive plan and housing production plan.

822
01:30:07,814 --> 01:30:16,142
But before we get into the PDD, we just have like a brief overview of our existing property and the proposed project.

823
01:30:18,127 --> 01:30:23,308
Danielle gave a brief introduction of who's here, but we do have a good contingent of our team here.

824
01:30:23,869 --> 01:30:26,129
So the Medford Housing Authority, we are the applicant.

825
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:33,671
The Cambridge Housing Authority is assisting the Medford Housing Authority as our development consultant.

826
01:30:34,932 --> 01:30:38,373
Our council is here, Hannah Kilson from Nolan Sheen Patent.

827
01:30:39,713 --> 01:30:43,774
Our architectural team is here, and also our civil engineering team.

828
01:30:43,794 --> 01:30:46,435
So our architect is Dietz and Company Architects.

829
01:30:47,313 --> 01:30:53,756
And Lee Morrison is here, and Danny Garbo, and Tisha, and we also have representatives from our civil engineering team.

830
01:30:54,657 --> 01:31:06,603
So, we're going to go through a brief overview of Walkland Court, the PDD process, our requesting zoning amendment, and then leaving it open to questions and comments after the presentation.

831
01:31:10,811 --> 01:31:23,279
So currently, the overview of our walk-in development, it is currently 144 units of state-aided public housing for low-income seniors in disabled households.

832
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:31,004
All units there are deeply affordable, with resident rents calculating at a maximum of 30% of their income.

833
01:31:33,525 --> 01:31:34,326
Walkman Court.

834
01:31:35,147 --> 01:31:39,331
Historically, it is our sole state development.

835
01:31:39,872 --> 01:31:50,684
Historically and currently has not received sufficient funding to operate, just to operate the development and address capital and physical needs.

836
01:31:52,101 --> 01:31:58,643
The development was built in 1963 and suffers from a few deficiencies.

837
01:31:58,663 --> 01:32:00,624
There's some pictures to the right of the slide.

838
01:32:00,664 --> 01:32:04,025
You can just see some of the typical conditions that we're dealing with at the buildings.

839
01:32:04,465 --> 01:32:12,287
But the main concern we have with the building for an elderly disabled development, it's the lack of accessibility features.

840
01:32:13,348 --> 01:32:19,550
So half of the units need to be assessed by stairs, which is not ideal for an elderly disabled population.

841
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:31,791
We get a lot of recommendations or what we call reasonable accommodations for residents to move from a second floor unit down to a first floor unit.

842
01:32:38,187 --> 01:32:44,952
So this is a bird's eye view of the Walkling Court site, and it's a very interesting site.

843
01:32:45,052 --> 01:32:50,036
As you can see, there's a variety of things going on around its borders.

844
01:32:50,916 --> 01:32:55,960
To the west, you have commercial use with the Whole Foods and Starbucks.

845
01:32:57,742 --> 01:33:01,084
To the south of the site is the

846
01:33:03,869 --> 01:33:08,200
railroad tracks and an industrial zone which has mid-rise buildings.

847
01:33:09,484 --> 01:33:11,128
They're like five stories or so.

848
01:33:12,807 --> 01:33:29,397
And then to the south of the site, you have the amazing amenity of the Mystic River, I'm sorry, the north of the site, the Mystic River Reservation, and a couple typical Medford residential, two-family, two-story, single and two-family, two-story homes.

849
01:33:30,117 --> 01:33:39,643
And to the east of the site is your typical Medford residential neighborhood with single-family, two-family homes.

850
01:33:40,735 --> 01:33:46,860
So to the top right is just a picture coming out of Walkland Court onto Auburn Street.

851
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:53,025
So it just kind of shows you what's going on as you enter or exit Walkland Court from that.

852
01:33:53,105 --> 01:33:57,588
There's currently two entrances to Walkland Court, one off of North Street and this one of Auburn Street.

853
01:33:57,628 --> 01:34:02,993
This is just showing a picture of the entrance from Auburn Street.

854
01:34:06,542 --> 01:34:11,705
And below is a picture from this would be kind of from the North street.

855
01:34:11,725 --> 01:34:13,946
There's a bridge over North street.

856
01:34:14,066 --> 01:34:16,267
This is kind of a picture looking down to the left.

857
01:34:16,327 --> 01:34:22,971
As you can see, this is a commercial or industrial mid rise buildings and you can see our.

858
01:34:24,672 --> 01:34:30,555
Development, this couple of our 2 story walk up garden flat buildings to the right.

859
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:42,437
And again, this is just across the fence to the west of the site is the Whole Foods parking lot and the commercial space.

860
01:34:49,322 --> 01:34:52,605
So, I'm going to turn it over right now to Natalie Janssen.

861
01:34:58,100 --> 01:35:09,003
I just want to just remind, as you go through, and I apologize for the interjection, is when you get to acronyms, if you can please just help the public and spell out any acronyms that may be used.

862
01:35:10,983 --> 01:35:11,843
Of course.

863
01:35:11,943 --> 01:35:12,204
Yep.

864
01:35:12,784 --> 01:35:13,104
Okay.

865
01:35:14,284 --> 01:35:16,284
Good evening, Madam Chair and members of the board.

866
01:35:16,325 --> 01:35:18,005
Thank you so much for having us again.

867
01:35:18,025 --> 01:35:19,865
My name is Natalie Anson.

868
01:35:19,925 --> 01:35:21,786
I'm with the Cambridge Housing Authority.

869
01:35:22,326 --> 01:35:26,027
We've been working with Medford Housing Authority on the Walklake Court redevelopment.

870
01:35:26,852 --> 01:35:43,768
Before I pass it on to Hannah, who will go through, Hannah Kilson, who will go through the PDD amendment language in greater detail, I just wanted to talk about the project that we have at hand.

871
01:35:43,928 --> 01:35:48,533
So the Medford Housing Authority started the pre-development process for

872
01:35:50,085 --> 01:35:51,046
in January of 2020.

873
01:35:52,006 --> 01:36:00,149
Since then, there's been a design process to develop a site plan as well as the drawings for the different buildings.

874
01:36:01,909 --> 01:36:11,512
The main goals of the redevelopment are to provide high quality, accessible and deeply affordable housing to the existing residents.

875
01:36:11,552 --> 01:36:14,873
So it's essentially to replace and preserve the 144 existing units on site.

876
01:36:17,854 --> 01:36:23,318
The second goal is to increase the number of deeply affordable housing units on site.

877
01:36:23,939 --> 01:36:33,185
And so the Medford Housing Authority is proposing to build an additional 94 net new affordable units that would be for a total 238 units on site.

878
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:52,195
As Gabe mentioned, it's an excellent location for affordable housing, given the fact that it is in very close proximity to transit, especially the new Green Line stop at Tufts, but also the future stop at the Mystic River.

879
01:36:54,909 --> 01:36:58,991
The other goals that we have for the site is through the redevelopment.

880
01:36:59,011 --> 01:37:05,815
There's a great opportunity here to improve the site's resiliency and sustainability.

881
01:37:06,055 --> 01:37:17,302
It will have to meet very high state and local requirements around that, as well as improve the site's connection to the surrounding neighborhood.

882
01:37:18,122 --> 01:37:38,255
So as Gabe mentioned, there's a lot of different uses around the site and a lot of different densities and the aerial view that you can see here shows how the various heights of the building and densities are carefully placed along the site to essentially reflect adjacencies.

883
01:37:39,968 --> 01:37:46,893
So the redevelopment of Wackling Court is a priority for the Medford Housing Authority, given the poor conditions on site.

884
01:37:47,474 --> 01:37:50,036
It's also a priority for the city of Medford.

885
01:37:51,657 --> 01:38:05,487
The fiscal year 2021-2025 City of Medford Housing Production Plan pinpoints Wackling Court as a place where the existing units need to be replaced.

886
01:38:07,292 --> 01:38:15,978
and that it's also a site where there's the potential of adding additional affordable housing, which is exactly what this project seeks to do.

887
01:38:16,998 --> 01:38:31,928
In addition, the 94 new deeply affordable units at Wockling would help the city of Medford meet 15% of its goal as part of its comprehensive plan to build 600 subsidized units.

888
01:38:33,186 --> 01:38:43,489
And I think a really important thing to remember when looking at this project is that all of the units that will be built on this site will be deeply affordable.

889
01:38:44,169 --> 01:38:52,151
What we mean by that is that they will all receive operating subsidy so that the tenant rent will be limited to 30% of a household's income.

890
01:38:59,281 --> 01:39:03,442
So this here essentially shows that aerial view, but now in site plan.

891
01:39:04,323 --> 01:39:14,506
So what we're looking at here is building A. It's a six-story senior mid-rise building for seniors and disabled residents.

892
01:39:15,546 --> 01:39:24,569
It is the one that's closest to the railroad tracks and across from it, the existing mid-rises that are located there in that industrial district.

893
01:39:25,597 --> 01:39:31,041
Building B is a four-story family mid-rise that will be elevator accessible.

894
01:39:31,061 --> 01:39:48,995
And then building C, E, and D essentially are adjacent to the surrounding residential fabric and reflect that two-story typology that you can see in that part of the hillside neighborhood.

895
01:39:50,044 --> 01:40:00,671
And then on the side here, you can see some renderings of the backyard space that will be a dedicated space for elderly and disabled residents.

896
01:40:00,771 --> 01:40:05,635
And then you can also see the family townhomes with the senior midrise in the back.

897
01:40:09,477 --> 01:40:17,743
So throughout the design and pre-development process, the MHA has led a very active and well-attended resident

898
01:40:18,839 --> 01:40:20,659
in neighborhood engagement process.

899
01:40:21,340 --> 01:40:42,385
There have been seven resident meetings, and as part of the last Community Development Board hearing on the planned development district, the MHA submitted 78 support letters from current residents of Walkland Court supporting the planned development district application

900
01:40:43,559 --> 01:40:55,944
There's also been five community meetings with neighbors of the site in order to gather feedback and to keep everyone updated on the project.

901
01:40:57,004 --> 01:41:09,990
In terms of notification to the neighbors for the community meetings, the MHA has received a list from the tax assessor's office of all property owners within 400 feet.

902
01:41:11,617 --> 01:41:12,798
of the property.

903
01:41:12,878 --> 01:41:15,180
That's what you're seeing here on this map in yellow.

904
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:22,846
And in advance of those community meetings, they've sent out mailings to those addresses.

905
01:41:24,207 --> 01:41:33,893
In addition, they went further in the, you see the blue swath that's surrounded by West Street, Lyman, Ave and Boston Ave.

906
01:41:34,633 --> 01:41:43,398
They flyered those households to let them know of the community meetings and also posted notices on telephone poles.

907
01:41:43,498 --> 01:41:51,163
So if you're walking around in the neighborhood, you could be made aware of the community meetings that were all held

908
01:41:52,057 --> 01:42:01,699
at the community room at Walkling Court in order to ensure that people who lived around the property could easily access the community meetings.

909
01:42:03,439 --> 01:42:19,502
In addition to the resident and neighborhood engagement process, the Medford Housing Authority and the whole Walkling Court team has met with a variety of city departments to get feedback and incorporate that, including meeting with the fire department,

910
01:42:20,712 --> 01:42:23,993
the building department and the Department of Public Works.

911
01:42:25,134 --> 01:42:44,482
And there's also been a series of public meetings related to the Walkland Court redevelopment project as part of the Community Preservation Act funding that the Medford Housing Authority has applied for in order to support this project.

912
01:42:49,365 --> 01:42:58,852
So we wanted to just take a minute to talk about some of the key discussion topics that have come up in these meetings.

913
01:42:59,787 --> 01:43:03,049
So one of the first ones is related to density and height.

914
01:43:05,169 --> 01:43:21,517
So as part of the redevelopment of Waukland Court, one of the goals that the Medford Housing Authority has, and that's also included in the city of Medford housing production plan is to increase the number of affordable housing units on site.

915
01:43:22,460 --> 01:43:35,502
And so as part of the design, there will be the 144 existing units that are being replaced, but there would also be 94 net new units on site.

916
01:43:36,383 --> 01:43:46,185
All of those would be deeply affordable, and that would be expected to increase the number of residents on site by approximately 101%, and that's based on

917
01:43:50,033 --> 01:43:56,219
average occupancy rates of the Medford Housing Authority has for variety unit types.

918
01:43:57,680 --> 01:44:07,089
In terms of the height of the different buildings on site, you know, the senior mid-rise, which essentially has five stories of living space,

919
01:44:08,380 --> 01:44:21,968
with the first story that is dedicated entirely to covered parking for senior disabled residents, as well as extensive new community space.

920
01:44:22,968 --> 01:44:25,910
The family mid-rise itself is four stories.

921
01:44:27,231 --> 01:44:35,415
And the height here is needed because one of the key goals of the project is to provide elevator access to not just

922
01:44:37,243 --> 01:44:46,326
elderly disabled residents, but as well to families, that's a really rare building typology that is needed in the city.

923
01:44:46,346 --> 01:44:56,069
And this will essentially allow residents who have accessibility needs to age in place and stay in these properties longer.

924
01:44:57,549 --> 01:45:10,313
But in addition to that, the more efficient footprint coupled with the height allows for more programmable and accessible open space outside of the buildings.

925
01:45:10,574 --> 01:45:26,319
And then the way that the design team has been working through the addition of this density and height on site is by very carefully placing it so that different building typologies or building types, mid-rise,

926
01:45:26,970 --> 01:45:33,273
is next to adjacent uses that are complementary or reflect similar heights and densities.

927
01:45:33,413 --> 01:45:42,738
So for example, senior mid-rise isn't being placed next to the two-story residential homes along North Street and Auburn Street.

928
01:45:44,697 --> 01:45:51,922
That brings us to the next topic, which is the proximity to the railroad track of the senior mid-rise building.

929
01:45:53,163 --> 01:46:06,153
So these buildings that are currently on site were built in 1963 when both standards of construction were much lower in terms of noise, but also building materials.

930
01:46:07,514 --> 01:46:10,696
The current facade is being designed

931
01:46:11,615 --> 01:46:16,258
to meet HUD noise requirements, which are much stricter today than they were back in 1963.

932
01:46:17,038 --> 01:46:29,245
And we have an acoustical engineer on the design team who has provided recommendations in terms of how to detail that facade in order to meet those HUD noise requirements.

933
01:46:29,385 --> 01:46:34,869
That includes using high-performance windows, as well as additional insulation.

934
01:46:36,388 --> 01:46:45,590
So based on that, our expectation is that noise will be greatly improved from what residents currently experience today.

935
01:46:45,610 --> 01:47:02,434
And it's also important that as part of this redevelopment, we're providing high quality units that have central AC and that also have mechanical ventilation to ensure that people have good environmental air quality indoors.

936
01:47:03,715 --> 01:47:23,605
And as we just saw with the other project that came before us for the amendment to their site plan review, there are many examples of comparable buildings that are placed adjacent to railroad tracks, especially now that there's more emphasis on building transit oriented developments like Rockland Court.

937
01:47:25,546 --> 01:47:33,210
The other item that's been discussed at the public meetings is the addition of an access road that would cut through

938
01:47:33,881 --> 01:47:47,668
Walkland Court, this access road is being included to provide resident and visitor access to the new buildings on site, but it also plays a very important role in terms of ensuring emergency access.

939
01:47:48,649 --> 01:47:56,413
And the design team has met with the fire department to review the site plan and that new access road.

940
01:47:59,034 --> 01:48:01,916
And, you know, he's been very supportive of it.

941
01:48:04,038 --> 01:48:14,806
as we continue to develop the design, the pedestrian, the road will be designed in such a way to ensure pedestrian safety.

942
01:48:16,227 --> 01:48:22,451
The other two things that are related to this topic is parking has come up as a question.

943
01:48:23,491 --> 01:48:31,717
So the current parking on site is 0.28 parking spaces per unit.

944
01:48:32,302 --> 01:48:42,086
And we will be increasing that in order to essentially make sure that parking needs for the development are met on site.

945
01:48:42,667 --> 01:48:51,611
And this is based on usage for low-income seniors and families that MHA has as part of their portfolio.

946
01:48:52,731 --> 01:49:01,095
And we also had a traffic impact survey done by Niche Engineering to look at any kind of traffic impacts of the new development

947
01:49:01,614 --> 01:49:07,136
and they determined that no traffic mitigation measures were warranted for this project.

948
01:49:08,976 --> 01:49:14,958
The final issue that I'm going to bring up is related to environmental issues.

949
01:49:15,939 --> 01:49:26,782
So the site is built on urban fill, and as part of the pre-development, we had a phase one and a phase two environmental site assessment done.

950
01:49:27,594 --> 01:49:36,320
And these site assessments found a variety of different contaminants that are pretty typical to a site that is made out of urban fill.

951
01:49:37,621 --> 01:49:44,126
So that means that as part of this redevelopment, there will be asbestos remediation, as well as soil removal.

952
01:49:44,866 --> 01:49:47,868
Those will have to meet state and federal requirements.

953
01:49:48,169 --> 01:49:55,554
And during construction, there will be monitoring to ensure that hazardous materials are properly handled.

954
01:49:56,414 --> 01:49:57,055
And lastly,

955
01:49:58,210 --> 01:50:09,733
There's no environmental impact statement that's needed for this project because the project does not meet any of the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Act thresholds.

956
01:50:09,993 --> 01:50:12,534
They're not exceeded as part of this project.

957
01:50:16,775 --> 01:50:20,116
So that brings us to the overview of the PDD process.

958
01:50:20,656 --> 01:50:27,538
So, Walkland Court is currently designed as, or not designed, it's currently zoned as apartment one.

959
01:50:28,948 --> 01:50:53,968
we had four pre-application meetings with the city in the spring and in the summer to discuss the planned development district as a potential option to essentially receive zoning that would allow for the redevelopment of Watling Fork to proceed in accordance with the housing production plan and the comprehensive plan.

960
01:50:55,129 --> 01:50:57,972
We submitted that PDD application on August 8th,

961
01:50:58,898 --> 01:51:03,921
of this year, had the first Community Development Board hearing on September 6.

962
01:51:04,182 --> 01:51:10,706
It then went to the City Council, who then referred it back to the CDB on September 19.

963
01:51:11,567 --> 01:51:26,357
And throughout this process, we've been working with the city and their attorney, Jonathan Silverstein, on the PDD3 zoning amendment, which I will now pass it on to our Council, Hannah Kilson, to describe in greater detail.

964
01:51:27,380 --> 01:51:29,162
Hannah Kilson, BOEB, she, her, hers, and hers.

965
01:51:42,544 --> 01:51:44,565
in Boston at 84 State Street.

966
01:51:45,366 --> 01:51:56,953
I want to do an overview of the zoning amendment and respond to the opening request of us, which was to give you context against current zoning.

967
01:51:58,374 --> 01:52:06,399
To begin, I'd like to make the point that the purpose for the PDD-3 and PDDs in general is to give

968
01:52:07,851 --> 01:52:23,362
Developers, the necessary flexibility right to redevelop and in this case, the housing authority, the ability to redevelop walk in court site so that it can address the shortage of accessible and affordable housing in Medford.

969
01:52:23,982 --> 01:52:37,274
So, the 1st element to remark on this PDD 3 zoning amendment is the permitted uses that will be made available on the site as a result of the PDD.

970
01:52:38,715 --> 01:52:42,018
So, the PDD would only have residential uses.

971
01:52:42,843 --> 01:52:47,384
and an accessory general office uses permitted on the site.

972
01:52:47,444 --> 01:52:51,606
There would be no other types of uses allowed on the site.

973
01:52:52,406 --> 01:53:11,752
The proposed PDD provides that the following uses are permitted as of right, which are the detached single-family dwelling, the attached single-family dwelling, the detached two-family dwelling, both class A and class B multiple dwellings,

974
01:53:12,492 --> 01:53:15,734
and senior housing independent living facility.

975
01:53:16,614 --> 01:53:30,622
Currently class B multiple dwellings are not permitted in an apartment one district and nor are and all senior housing facilities require a special permit.

976
01:53:31,283 --> 01:53:38,767
So the this which the PDD would allow for the development of the of the site for a class B

977
01:53:39,461 --> 01:53:44,764
multiple dwelling, which is one which has no more than 75 feet and six stories.

978
01:53:45,464 --> 01:54:05,635
There would be residential uses that would be permitted by special permit, and those are noted here with dormitory fraternity and sorority houses, lodging and boarding houses, and other senior housing facilities, which are also currently in an apartment one district permitted by special permit.

979
01:54:08,785 --> 01:54:22,156
And then the other use, as I noted at the beginning, was that there would be accessory general office use would be permitted as of right associated with the residential use.

980
01:54:22,476 --> 01:54:31,923
And this permitted use would enable the management offices to be located within the multifamily dwelling for the development.

981
01:54:32,668 --> 01:54:34,011
So that's residential uses.

982
01:54:34,852 --> 01:54:38,540
I'd like to turn now to talk about the dimensional

983
01:54:39,080 --> 01:54:52,828
provisions in the PDD amendment, which as I noted before, really give the project the flexibility needed to build this highly needed type of housing in Medford.

984
01:54:53,689 --> 01:55:03,715
So the maximum number of principal structures, there would be no limit in terms of the number of principal structures permitted on the site under the PDD.

985
01:55:05,166 --> 01:55:10,728
but all principal structures would need to be at least 15 feet apart from one another.

986
01:55:11,448 --> 01:55:15,289
Currently on the site, there are nine structures on the site.

987
01:55:15,629 --> 01:55:19,351
There's residential buildings, a small garage, and the community center.

988
01:55:20,871 --> 01:55:32,315
It is my understanding that there's a recent amendment or a proposed amendment that postdates our application that is now supposed to allow for multiple

989
01:55:33,734 --> 01:55:36,357
buildings on in an apartment one district.

990
01:55:37,338 --> 01:55:41,141
But I haven't, I'm unclear on the status of that.

991
01:55:41,262 --> 01:55:48,709
So for the purposes of our amendment, we continue to include that provision so that we can have the multiple buildings on this site.

992
01:55:50,397 --> 01:56:04,140
As Natalie described in her presentation, we are through this PDD increasing the density at the site in order to allow us to achieve the objectives of creating more affordable housing.

993
01:56:04,980 --> 01:56:06,440
What does that look like?

994
01:56:07,480 --> 01:56:13,381
It looks like that our minimum lot area, though the base is 10,000 square feet,

995
01:56:16,978 --> 01:56:21,842
in an apartment one, it then is really calculated based on dwelling units.

996
01:56:22,342 --> 01:56:38,254
And we would allow for 750 square feet per dwelling unit rather than what would be generated kind of through a formula that you have in your zoning that would generate a requirement of 940.

997
01:56:39,975 --> 01:56:49,119
square feet per dwelling unit for development of the size that we would be proposing here, which is 238 units.

998
01:56:49,860 --> 01:57:02,286
The other element of density to note here is also that the maximum lot coverage, we are proposing that maximum lot coverage would be 35 percent.

999
01:57:05,706 --> 01:57:15,752
The design puts our lot coverage actually at 30%, which is also what is in an apartment one district.

1000
01:57:16,393 --> 01:57:22,816
But here we've done that to just allow for some flexibility in the design.

1001
01:57:23,717 --> 01:57:30,901
The other two pieces of density that I just want to call out to the board relates to open space.

1002
01:57:31,405 --> 01:57:39,348
The landscaped open space would be 10% in this PDD, and it is 10% in an apartment one district.

1003
01:57:40,629 --> 01:57:49,493
The usable open space, given the way in which we will reconfigure the development, will be 10% as well of the gross floor area.

1004
01:57:49,993 --> 01:57:53,754
And this usable space, though lower than the 25%

1005
01:57:56,296 --> 01:58:07,603
that is in an apartment one district actually will be as designed, more accessible, and in fact, more usable than the existing open space that's on the site.

1006
01:58:09,685 --> 01:58:15,428
I think the other density piece, Natalie, can you go to the next slide?

1007
01:58:15,468 --> 01:58:18,611
Because I think we should talk about height and stories.

1008
01:58:21,456 --> 01:58:26,078
This PDD3 has two uses that we are proposing.

1009
01:58:26,819 --> 01:58:34,102
One is multiple dwelling, class A and class B. Another use is attached single family dwellings.

1010
01:58:34,343 --> 01:58:36,664
And so height is correlated to those uses.

1011
01:58:37,224 --> 01:58:44,788
So for multiple dwellings, we are looking at maximum of 75 feet and six stories.

1012
01:58:46,288 --> 01:58:53,350
And for the attached single-family dwellings, we are looking at a maximum height of 35 and three stories.

1013
01:58:54,511 --> 01:59:05,534
In an apartment one district, where attached single-family dwellings height in stories is the same as is being proposed in this PDD.

1014
01:59:06,994 --> 01:59:15,357
And as I mentioned before, only multiple dwelling class A's are currently permitted within an apartment one district.

1015
01:59:17,633 --> 01:59:32,421
The front yard, side yard, and rear yard setbacks that are being proposed here, 15 feet on the front yard, 10 on the side yard, and 15 on the rear yard, reflect the current structure of the site as it is today.

1016
01:59:32,441 --> 01:59:36,123
We are continuing that.

1017
01:59:37,263 --> 01:59:44,587
In the current zoning on apartment one district, the front yard is 10 feet, the side yard is 10 feet,

1018
01:59:47,858 --> 01:59:53,520
And the for single family, and it is 15 feet rear yard.

1019
01:59:53,960 --> 02:00:03,523
So, somewhat similar, but this really is what is currently on the on the property and we're not making any change from what is existing currently existing there in the development.

1020
02:00:05,844 --> 02:00:09,825
And the last 2 things to remark on is frontage on the.

1021
02:00:10,111 --> 02:00:12,672
but could you go back Natalie to the lot configuration?

1022
02:00:13,612 --> 02:00:22,955
So any lot on this PDD3 has to have a frontage of 35 feet, a width of 35 feet and a depth of 75 feet.

1023
02:00:23,515 --> 02:00:27,676
And that's similar to the current requirements for attached single family dwellings.

1024
02:00:28,556 --> 02:00:30,917
And so we're continuing that here.

1025
02:00:32,325 --> 02:00:43,193
The last dimensional piece I think that I would note to the board, and Natalie noted it in her presentation, was just parking.

1026
02:00:43,273 --> 02:00:58,543
The proposed parking requirements under this PDD amendment would be the same parking requirement that's imposed on affordable housing developments under the current zoning ordinance for Medford, which is

1027
02:01:00,462 --> 02:01:02,364
one space per two units.

1028
02:01:03,364 --> 02:01:05,086
And so we would be continuing that.

1029
02:01:05,106 --> 02:01:17,916
Um, and in fact, the development as Natalie mentioned, we'll build more, uh, enough spaces to comply with that, uh, which is more than the existing ratio of parking on site.

1030
02:01:19,577 --> 02:01:27,223
I think that concludes kind of my overview, um, on the zoning provisions of how the PDD

1031
02:01:28,351 --> 02:01:41,424
would modify what currently applies to this site in order to allow us to redevelop Lockling Fort and make it both more accessible and expand its affordability.

1032
02:01:41,444 --> 02:01:51,333
Are there any questions?

1033
02:01:51,373 --> 02:01:52,855
I'm happy to answer those now.

1034
02:02:00,510 --> 02:02:02,091
Thank you so much attorney Kilson.

1035
02:02:10,535 --> 02:02:18,059
So, when I conclude your presentation, I'm going to open it up to the city staff to add anything.

1036
02:02:18,699 --> 02:02:20,060
Any questions from the city staff.

1037
02:02:25,702 --> 02:02:42,633
Thank you madam chair, we've had many conversations with the housing authority about this, so I don't believe that we have any questions or clarifications at this time, but if there's anything we can answer for the board, we're also happy to.

1038
02:02:45,455 --> 02:02:45,936
Thank you.

1039
02:02:45,956 --> 02:02:50,779
In that case, are there any questions clarifying questions from the board?

1040
02:02:57,927 --> 02:03:03,309
Uh, I don't have any questions, but as I, as I noted, the last time this meeting came up as.

1041
02:03:03,989 --> 02:03:08,271
I work for niche engineering, I will be refusing myself from this session.

1042
02:03:08,631 --> 02:03:08,931
Thank you.

1043
02:03:09,551 --> 02:03:09,892
Thank you.

1044
02:03:13,173 --> 02:03:14,413
Madam chair, I've got a question.

1045
02:03:15,294 --> 02:03:16,894
Yes, please go ahead.

1046
02:03:18,115 --> 02:03:24,017
I saw that in the presentation, noting that the green line phase 2 being prominent in that.

1047
02:03:25,196 --> 02:03:31,621
Uh, and that, uh, description, uh, has there been any talk or any confirmation.

1048
02:03:32,622 --> 02:03:38,226
Between the housing authority and the MBTA regarding the extension of the line to.

1049
02:03:38,246 --> 02:03:40,648
As shown in the diagram.

1050
02:03:46,942 --> 02:03:56,208
Madam Chair, I don't know if the Housing Authority wants to address that, but I could give you an update on the Green Line extension phase two.

1051
02:03:57,268 --> 02:04:06,554
The next step in that would be to have the state do an environmental review to determine the environmental impacts of an extension to Route 16.

1052
02:04:07,054 --> 02:04:15,379
And that is something that our legislative delegation and a number of elected officials are working to get that environmental review funded.

1053
02:04:16,100 --> 02:04:20,805
And that would be the next step before there would be any level of commitment to actually building it.

1054
02:04:22,187 --> 02:04:26,392
And so, since I've been party to those conversations, I want to let you know that's where it stands.

1055
02:04:26,412 --> 02:04:30,136
The Housing Authority couldn't have any guarantees from the state on building.

1056
02:04:30,637 --> 02:04:34,382
Simply, we're waiting for the, we're hoping for an environmental review first.

1057
02:04:35,454 --> 02:04:42,976
My, my question revolves around, like, the extension up to Medford substation right now has been built.

1058
02:04:43,776 --> 02:04:48,737
By moving the current 2 tracks for the community rail on the other side and adding 2 more tracks.

1059
02:04:49,517 --> 02:04:54,319
On the right side to accommodate for the green line, the green line trains.

1060
02:04:54,739 --> 02:04:59,660
So, if we do so, and the current location, wouldn't that come much closer to.

1061
02:05:01,120 --> 02:05:03,302
uh, where the new building is being built.

1062
02:05:03,642 --> 02:05:14,490
And if, uh, if that is so, I see there's like 25 parking spots on the, uh, back end towards the station that might be affected as well.

1063
02:05:14,711 --> 02:05:19,054
So that's the reason I'm, uh, having the questions here.

1064
02:05:20,135 --> 02:05:20,935
Excellent question.

1065
02:05:20,995 --> 02:05:22,997
That I would have to defer to the housing authority.

1066
02:05:28,474 --> 02:05:29,755
Can I just ask a clarification?

1067
02:05:29,795 --> 02:05:38,342
Is the question that there's the concern that the, that the, those spaces would be lost because the T would take those areas?

1068
02:05:41,064 --> 02:05:52,975
Yes, like the space required to add 2 more tracks might result in some more additional land or at least some space being given to add those 2 tracks.

1069
02:05:54,398 --> 02:05:58,121
uh, besides the commuter rail tracks, which are there right now.

1070
02:06:00,564 --> 02:06:09,932
So that's why I was thinking maybe it's a good idea to have some initial talks with the T about if they have any plans of where the track alignment is going to be like.

1071
02:06:13,915 --> 02:06:18,920
I don't think to date we've had any conversations with them on that point, but thank you for putting that in front of us.

1072
02:06:22,515 --> 02:06:24,536
All right, I do have a second question, if I may.

1073
02:06:25,416 --> 02:06:25,916
Absolutely.

1074
02:06:26,556 --> 02:06:33,558
The traffic study performed by NIST engineering seems to be during the time of COVID.

1075
02:06:33,638 --> 02:06:37,319
I think it's October 2020, if I'm not mistaken.

1076
02:06:39,159 --> 02:06:49,482
And the study area is about 400 square feet around the walking court area.

1077
02:06:51,657 --> 02:07:00,982
Looking at the numbers, it seems like, uh, like they made some adjustments as well as taken 2018 as the baseline for the graphic data.

1078
02:07:01,923 --> 02:07:03,884
Uh, like, uh.

1079
02:07:05,144 --> 02:07:13,829
I've been through that area quite a few times and with the Greenland extension being completed now, the traffic does seem to have increased a lot.

1080
02:07:15,470 --> 02:07:22,334
I'm not sure if that current data, the data being used is relevant at this time or not.

1081
02:07:22,414 --> 02:07:29,239
So I just want to make sure that proper adjustments has been made in the traffic data.

1082
02:07:30,159 --> 02:07:35,781
to reflect what is currently, uh, present at that locations.

1083
02:07:39,163 --> 02:07:43,065
Thank you so much, actually, um, uh, Shirab for that question.

1084
02:07:43,085 --> 02:07:46,946
Um, and that, and that second part, I think that that would be more related in site plan.

1085
02:07:47,006 --> 02:07:57,771
And, and one of the things I want to remind the board of tonight is that the discussion is limited to amendment questions surrounding language in recommending, um, the zoning ordinance back to the city council.

1086
02:07:58,251 --> 02:07:58,952
However, um, um,

1087
02:08:00,798 --> 02:08:04,841
I'm going to defer to Attorney Silverstein.

1088
02:08:04,901 --> 02:08:07,662
I just think I saw your hand up if you want to add something there.

1089
02:08:09,003 --> 02:08:11,605
It was up, Madam Chair, but you stole my thunder.

1090
02:08:11,625 --> 02:08:24,533
That's exactly what I was going to say, that any questions about the specifics of the project, specific impacts, I just wanted to assure the board that there's going to be another opportunity.

1091
02:08:25,351 --> 02:08:31,535
to the site plan review process, and then the council ultimately still has to issue a special permit.

1092
02:08:32,176 --> 02:08:39,301
So all of those specific project impact inquiries can be addressed at that point.

1093
02:08:39,961 --> 02:08:47,547
And as you said, this is really just about clearing the way, creating the path for the applicant to submit an application.

1094
02:08:49,777 --> 02:08:55,499
Thank you so much attorney, so staying again, just to recap approval of the zoning doesn't necessarily approve the project.

1095
02:08:55,799 --> 02:08:59,000
We still have to do our due diligence with the site plan review.

1096
02:08:59,100 --> 02:09:01,041
So we will save that for then.

1097
02:09:03,722 --> 02:09:04,883
Are you all set?

1098
02:09:05,823 --> 02:09:07,243
Or do you have any other questions?

1099
02:09:07,764 --> 02:09:08,244
Yes, I am.

1100
02:09:08,304 --> 02:09:08,964
Thank you very much.

1101
02:09:09,324 --> 02:09:09,584
Okay.

1102
02:09:09,884 --> 02:09:12,385
Are there any other questions from the board?

1103
02:09:15,646 --> 02:09:16,327
Not at this time.

1104
02:09:16,347 --> 02:09:16,947
Thank you, chair.

1105
02:09:19,247 --> 02:09:24,191
So, I am going to open it up for public comment.

1106
02:09:25,272 --> 02:09:30,056
Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

1107
02:09:30,196 --> 02:09:34,339
You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

1108
02:09:35,160 --> 02:09:37,902
Individuals may have up to two minutes to provide comments.

1109
02:09:38,142 --> 02:09:41,905
Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

1110
02:09:42,626 --> 02:09:43,987
Please do not use the staff

1111
02:09:45,083 --> 02:09:49,465
to provide comments as it is not a part of the public record and just so that the public understands.

1112
02:09:49,906 --> 02:09:55,428
That's why the chat feature has been disabled so that we can capture all of your comments for public record.

1113
02:09:56,889 --> 02:10:04,072
The first hand that I saw, well, Danielle is going to manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails and letters.

1114
02:10:04,432 --> 02:10:05,372
But I do know that Ms.

1115
02:10:05,412 --> 02:10:08,534
Roberta Cameron was the very first person to put her hand up.

1116
02:10:09,274 --> 02:10:10,635
And I'll let Danielle take it from there.

1117
02:10:14,273 --> 02:10:19,718
Yes, Roberta is the 1st person on the participant list for the hand up.

1118
02:10:24,342 --> 02:10:26,944
You're muted Roberta.

1119
02:10:30,638 --> 02:10:34,960
Thank you very much for recognizing me, Roberta Cameron 12 North Street.

1120
02:10:35,680 --> 02:10:52,246
I am chair of the Community Preservation Committee which provided significant funding for this project as was mentioned previously, and I'm also a neighbor of this development being located just across the street on North Street from the project site.

1121
02:10:53,166 --> 02:11:05,722
And I wanted to reiterate comments that I provided in the past about the importance of this project for increasing accessible, comfortable housing for seniors.

1122
02:11:06,382 --> 02:11:12,029
There is not a better alternative to be able to improve the quality of

1123
02:11:12,710 --> 02:11:31,634
living for seniors at the walk lane court development site for those who currently live there and it will add additional housing for seniors as well as for families and for families and young adults with disabilities at the site.

1124
02:11:31,654 --> 02:11:32,055
It is

1125
02:11:34,055 --> 02:11:46,725
incredibly important for the city to increase its supply of affordable housing and throughout the city in every possible, every appropriate location.

1126
02:11:47,145 --> 02:11:49,107
And this location is appropriate.

1127
02:11:49,207 --> 02:11:58,754
As was mentioned before, there has been a significant amount of new development just in the past few years in similar

1128
02:11:59,895 --> 02:12:09,258
proximity to the same train line in Somerville and as proposed in Medford.

1129
02:12:12,119 --> 02:12:21,582
The standards today will provide for a better quality of life for those living near the train line than was provided in

1130
02:12:22,602 --> 02:12:26,343
1962 when these units were built originally.

1131
02:12:27,704 --> 02:12:43,608
In fact, as shown in the proposed plan, although I understand that it's not cast in stone, that the permitting process will provide opportunities for refining the plans, but

1132
02:12:44,749 --> 02:12:50,513
some of the existing units are closer to the tracks than the proposed units.

1133
02:12:50,933 --> 02:12:58,739
So I think that this development is going to hold the Housing Authority to a higher standard.

1134
02:12:59,218 --> 02:13:03,662
of quality of housing units than what they currently provide.

1135
02:13:04,543 --> 02:13:14,113
And I want to see the seniors have higher quality units and I want to see more people be able to access affordable housing in my own neighborhood.

1136
02:13:14,773 --> 02:13:17,817
than can currently live here.

1137
02:13:17,837 --> 02:13:33,174
And I also am not concerned about the impact of a through street, although originally I had strongly preferred the idea of

1138
02:13:33,915 --> 02:13:48,220
Not having a through street through this, through this development, but having seen alternatives considered and weighed and evaluated by the housing authority and their development team.

1139
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:54,602
I'm persuaded that this really is the best option and that it can be designed in a way that will.

1140
02:13:57,043 --> 02:14:01,405
That will prioritize pedestrians walking through the site and I would.

1141
02:14:02,145 --> 02:14:25,132
hope that the Community Development Board and the City Council will approve zoning that enables this project to move forward and will help the Housing Authority to refine the site plan so that it really prioritizes the needs of the residents on this site and the neighbors in the neighborhood.

1142
02:14:25,752 --> 02:14:26,372
Thank you very much.

1143
02:14:38,683 --> 02:14:43,109
Next on the list is Kate.

1144
02:14:45,692 --> 02:14:49,717
If you want to unmute and give your full name and address.

1145
02:14:56,682 --> 02:15:06,224
My name is Kate Ryan, I live at 15 Canal Street in Medford, and I am a person who could be a potential resident of these new houses.

1146
02:15:06,964 --> 02:15:18,247
I am multiply disabled with a progressive disease, and I am desperate for accessible housing, which does not currently exist enough of in Medford.

1147
02:15:18,567 --> 02:15:25,068
Many of the Medford Housing Authority sites for seniors and disabled people are sadly inaccessible.

1148
02:15:25,775 --> 02:15:54,303
And I'm really, really sorry that a lot of the neighbors don't want to have me as their neighbor, but I assure you that the people who live here and who live there and who are going to live there are just as deserving of clean, nice, new housing as anyone else, despite the fact that we may be born with broken brains or develop broken bodies over the years, or just grow old as hopefully all of you will do.

1149
02:15:55,335 --> 02:16:06,397
I cannot express how wonderful this development would be for people with disabilities and for everyone.

1150
02:16:07,537 --> 02:16:20,420
And the fact that we might not have as much money does not mean that we do not equally contribute to the community.

1151
02:16:27,367 --> 02:16:37,533
And if anyone would like, by the way, to trade one of the nice shiny new units for anyone's disability, I'm sure we would all be very, very happy to.

1152
02:16:39,954 --> 02:16:50,080
Nobody takes me up on that.

1153
02:16:50,100 --> 02:16:51,961
Okay, next is Chris Bennett.

1154
02:17:12,779 --> 02:17:17,702
I was trying to unmute myself, but I was not allowed to unmute myself, so I had to wait until you unmuted me.

1155
02:17:18,442 --> 02:17:19,723
I have a couple of concerns.

1156
02:17:19,783 --> 02:17:27,707
I was reading over the reports that I saw, and there were a couple of factors that I thought were kind of interesting.

1157
02:17:28,908 --> 02:17:37,633
To create sustainable climate resilient buildings to last 40 plus years was kind of a mind boggling thing to me, considering the fact that

1158
02:17:39,207 --> 02:17:45,629
The current buildings that we are looking at in Walkling Court were built, what, 70 years ago?

1159
02:17:46,069 --> 02:17:53,030
And we're saying, okay, we're gonna build you some new buildings that will last 40 plus years, which doesn't tell me a lot.

1160
02:17:53,690 --> 02:18:00,192
So then it brings me into the fact that we're building these massive buildings, and I've seen how

1161
02:18:00,890 --> 02:18:02,751
walk-in court has been maintained.

1162
02:18:03,212 --> 02:18:09,256
And I look at that as a comparison to the federal building, which is like the Riverside Ave buildings.

1163
02:18:10,957 --> 02:18:15,820
And the stuff has been maintained for a very, very long time.

1164
02:18:16,340 --> 02:18:19,022
So we're gonna build all of these pristine brand new buildings.

1165
02:18:19,202 --> 02:18:22,124
And I'm looking at how are they going to be maintained?

1166
02:18:22,685 --> 02:18:27,668
I'm looking at the fact that they're not utilizing appropriate

1167
02:18:28,856 --> 02:18:33,138
traffic patterns and what goes on in those traffic patterns in that area.

1168
02:18:33,538 --> 02:18:47,623
When we're talking about a through street, they actually made the major street going up by the Brooks School, you could not take a left turn there because there were so many traffic accidents.

1169
02:18:47,683 --> 02:18:51,264
You can just look on the corner and see everything broken down.

1170
02:18:51,324 --> 02:18:53,845
So there's just so many things I'm looking at saying,

1171
02:18:54,645 --> 02:19:00,878
This is not an appropriate setting to put so many buildings into one area.

1172
02:19:02,215 --> 02:19:04,196
the amount of traffic that it's going to increase.

1173
02:19:04,656 --> 02:19:11,477
It has nothing to do with not wanting housing there as the previous person spoke about.

1174
02:19:11,497 --> 02:19:14,938
It has nothing to do with not wanting affordable housing.

1175
02:19:15,418 --> 02:19:24,480
It has to do with looking at it in an appropriate way to determine whether or not this in fact is going, how this is going to impact all of the surrounding area.

1176
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,321
This is a neighborhood.

1177
02:19:26,341 --> 02:19:28,301
Sorry to interrupt, Chris.

1178
02:19:28,561 --> 02:19:31,362
I'm just letting you know that you're at your two minutes.

1179
02:19:31,902 --> 02:19:34,082
Okay, and what about the person that was there?

1180
02:19:34,803 --> 02:19:42,784
Well, the person that was there prior to, that was talking about, the person that was a North Street resident spoke much longer than two minutes.

1181
02:19:42,804 --> 02:19:51,805
So I'm just stating, there's a lot of major issues and there has not been enough time for the people that are going to be impacted this directly.

1182
02:19:52,285 --> 02:19:58,907
And I consider myself one of them, I live on Martin Street in Medford, that that's going to have a direct impact on me.

1183
02:19:58,967 --> 02:20:01,467
I'm a walker, I walk through that area all the time.

1184
02:20:02,014 --> 02:20:04,498
and they're not looking at all of those aspects.

1185
02:20:15,654 --> 02:20:16,616
Susan Gerard.

1186
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:28,522
I do believe, I guess to answer the previous speaker, that the traffic is being looked at.

1187
02:20:29,322 --> 02:20:40,926
I believe they're looking at a minimal number of cars for these particular residents, but I really wanted to speak about why it's needed.

1188
02:20:41,486 --> 02:20:43,647
I don't live in the area, so I'm not a neighbor.

1189
02:20:43,707 --> 02:20:51,170
I'm not impacted in that way, but I used to tutor an immigrant woman who lived in

1190
02:20:52,090 --> 02:21:06,577
in that project and she had pancreatic cancer and she could no longer get up those stairs and luckily was able to move to another senior housing they did eventually move her to another senior housing.

1191
02:21:08,027 --> 02:21:11,849
because she was so severely disabled and the project wasn't going to work for her.

1192
02:21:11,929 --> 02:21:13,509
She was moved to one with an elevator.

1193
02:21:14,030 --> 02:21:26,615
But in my church, I've had a number of friends who cannot afford even the, quote, affordable rents in Medford, but were qualified for senior housing.

1194
02:21:26,715 --> 02:21:30,856
But the waiting lists are years long, like two years long.

1195
02:21:31,636 --> 02:21:35,278
And a couple of them were actually facing imminent homelessness.

1196
02:21:35,818 --> 02:21:41,741
Some of them lived with us for periods of time where they eventually got public housing in other cities.

1197
02:21:41,781 --> 02:21:43,102
They had to move out of Medford.

1198
02:21:44,563 --> 02:21:49,946
So, I mean, there is a crying need for seriously affordable housing.

1199
02:21:50,687 --> 02:21:53,168
And I've lived in Medford for 40 years.

1200
02:21:53,508 --> 02:22:01,893
And to me, this is the most, the first really exciting public housing that I've seen happen that is truly affordable.

1201
02:22:02,374 --> 02:22:07,349
So I know there are concerns about parking and traffic and all those.

1202
02:22:07,429 --> 02:22:09,576
I do believe they're being seriously addressed.

1203
02:22:11,289 --> 02:22:21,417
And as far as the maintenance goes, you pointed out, I think that the federal buildings are better maintained, but I think, someone will correct me, this will be partially a federal building.

1204
02:22:21,878 --> 02:22:30,084
This will be turned over to the, in part, to the federal government, who does a better job of maintaining buildings than, alas, our state does.

1205
02:22:30,425 --> 02:22:32,426
And someone can correct me if I'm wrong on that.

1206
02:22:32,847 --> 02:22:33,207
Thank you.

1207
02:22:44,470 --> 02:22:45,911
Andrei Golosov.

1208
02:22:49,714 --> 02:22:50,735
Hello, can you hear me?

1209
02:22:52,717 --> 02:22:52,877
Yes.

1210
02:22:54,879 --> 02:22:55,499
Can you hear me?

1211
02:22:56,640 --> 02:22:57,601
Yes, yes.

1212
02:22:58,842 --> 02:23:04,086
Okay, my name is Andrei Golosov from 3 North and Ave, so I live very close by.

1213
02:23:04,106 --> 02:23:10,752
I think it's a, you know, it's a great attempt to actually to address the shortage of affordable housing.

1214
02:23:13,003 --> 02:23:17,144
However, I kind of believe that a few things needs to be addressed.

1215
02:23:17,304 --> 02:23:28,107
One is, of course, brought by Sharag that the traffic and other people, the traffic needs to be reassessed because it was reassessed at the pandemic time.

1216
02:23:29,988 --> 02:23:39,130
But the main focus actually I want to bring up is that it seems to be that the current proposal actually puts elderly and disabled at the biggest disadvantage.

1217
02:23:39,972 --> 02:23:44,174
respect to the noise from the rail track, because they're the building going to be up front.

1218
02:23:45,054 --> 02:23:56,578
While the families without actually disabilities will live in the townhouses, you know, shielded from noise by actually those buildings.

1219
02:23:57,399 --> 02:24:01,280
And it's, you know, kind of, that's kind of the main concern.

1220
02:24:01,460 --> 02:24:06,302
And the, you know, many elderly people actually have problems with sleep

1221
02:24:07,496 --> 02:24:13,319
And therefore doing things like that, you know, is not actually is a great thing.

1222
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:21,644
And, um, you know, why not choose a different orientation of buildings like they have right now?

1223
02:24:22,785 --> 02:24:26,047
Um, some of them perpendicular to the rail tracks.

1224
02:24:27,027 --> 02:24:34,632
And also the other thing is the location out where you put the more senior and the elderly, uh, people.

1225
02:24:35,926 --> 02:24:41,590
And also, you know, you have where you have townhouses, townhouses are not the most efficient use of the land.

1226
02:24:42,651 --> 02:24:45,893
You have two story buildings there, so why not upgrade it?

1227
02:24:46,833 --> 02:24:48,494
Yeah, thank you for your consideration.

1228
02:25:01,343 --> 02:25:01,583
Paul.

1229
02:25:05,073 --> 02:25:05,974
Good evening, everyone.

1230
02:25:06,874 --> 02:25:08,115
My name is Paul Ferrazani.

1231
02:25:08,155 --> 02:25:11,037
I live at 4 North Nav, which is very, very close.

1232
02:25:13,279 --> 02:25:25,248
Some of the concerns that I'm seeing are, you know, everything that everybody's mentioned, the traffic is out of control and parking and all of that.

1233
02:25:26,589 --> 02:25:32,313
My thing is, this is going to be great for the elderly and for the disabled.

1234
02:25:33,054 --> 02:25:34,235
I have a son who's disabled.

1235
02:25:35,242 --> 02:25:41,183
And I would love to see housing for those people at an affordable rate.

1236
02:25:42,784 --> 02:25:46,585
I don't think families should be there.

1237
02:25:47,305 --> 02:25:56,227
I think it should only be for elderly and disabled like it was started back in the 60s.

1238
02:25:58,207 --> 02:26:01,308
I think adding more families to the area

1239
02:26:02,533 --> 02:26:07,016
uh, is going to cause a lot of, I guess, issues.

1240
02:26:08,237 --> 02:26:10,479
So, uh, it's just too many people.

1241
02:26:11,299 --> 02:26:20,165
Um, we need to figure out, you know, what's the list look like for elderly and for disabled and accommodate them.

1242
02:26:20,185 --> 02:26:21,766
Okay.

1243
02:26:22,507 --> 02:26:25,349
Uh, I don't know what else to say about that.

1244
02:26:25,849 --> 02:26:31,233
Uh, it's just, it's like taking 10 pounds of, you know, what, and putting it in a two pound bag.

1245
02:26:32,182 --> 02:26:37,067
And that's what's going on need to, you know, really, really look at the numbers.

1246
02:26:38,189 --> 02:26:43,755
And, um, I think we should focus on the elderly and the disabled.

1247
02:26:45,617 --> 02:26:45,917
Thank you.

1248
02:27:15,916 --> 02:27:18,958
Sorry, I'm going to scroll down here.

1249
02:27:25,223 --> 02:27:26,044
William Navarro.

1250
02:27:29,126 --> 02:27:30,707
Hi there, thank you for recognizing me.

1251
02:27:30,727 --> 02:27:33,489
108 Medford Street.

1252
02:27:34,630 --> 02:27:36,812
I just want to say that I support this project.

1253
02:27:37,752 --> 02:27:38,733
We need more housing.

1254
02:27:38,753 --> 02:27:41,035
A lot of people want to live in the city.

1255
02:27:41,899 --> 02:27:45,521
including elderly, disabled, and yes, indeed, families.

1256
02:27:46,221 --> 02:27:47,621
I really think that we have a lot.

1257
02:27:47,882 --> 02:27:49,082
I don't think Medford is full.

1258
02:27:49,642 --> 02:27:51,283
I don't think any of our neighborhoods are full.

1259
02:27:53,044 --> 02:27:55,225
I don't think there's any reason to think that.

1260
02:27:57,878 --> 02:28:02,760
that any amount of people coming in is 10 pounds of you-know-what.

1261
02:28:03,481 --> 02:28:07,342
I don't think that that's a realistic, reasonable way to talk about people.

1262
02:28:07,362 --> 02:28:13,784
I don't think that a previous commenter was even talking about any people in specific, just that there's a problem of too many people.

1263
02:28:14,345 --> 02:28:15,725
But I walk around and I don't see that.

1264
02:28:15,745 --> 02:28:22,307
I don't see that our sidewalks are crowded or when you go to the grocery store, you can't get inside because I just don't see that.

1265
02:28:23,548 --> 02:28:26,089
So I don't think we're overflowing with people.

1266
02:28:27,465 --> 02:28:30,886
And I think we have room for more of all kinds.

1267
02:28:30,966 --> 02:28:43,230
And I think that the idea should be that eventually we accommodate more people in Medford in general, but I really like the idea that we're going to start by housing our most vulnerable members of the community.

1268
02:28:43,450 --> 02:28:44,550
That's not where we stop.

1269
02:28:44,890 --> 02:28:50,452
Everybody deserves housing, but it's a really great place to start, you know, by housing the disabled,

1270
02:28:51,769 --> 02:28:59,095
The elderly, which is the focus of the project, and yes, a pretty small number of families of very modest means.

1271
02:28:59,575 --> 02:29:03,278
That's a really good place to start to welcome more people into our community, I think.

1272
02:29:03,498 --> 02:29:06,300
And that's what we need to do if we're gonna solve the housing crisis.

1273
02:29:06,340 --> 02:29:15,326
We want people to be able to live near the city so they're not driving a million miles, causing traffic on our highways and creating pollution and et cetera, et cetera.

1274
02:29:15,926 --> 02:29:17,367
So I really support this.

1275
02:29:18,248 --> 02:29:19,489
I don't think Medford is full.

1276
02:29:19,969 --> 02:29:23,972
I don't think we have 10 pounds of anything, a two-pound anything.

1277
02:29:24,972 --> 02:29:32,377
So I hope that the Community Development Board reports favorably on the project or the zoning necessary to make the project allowed.

1278
02:29:32,397 --> 02:29:32,977
Thanks.

1279
02:29:37,040 --> 02:29:38,201
Next is Mark Curtis.

1280
02:29:41,763 --> 02:29:42,403
Thanks, Danielle.

1281
02:29:43,364 --> 02:29:45,825
Mark Curtis, 89 Train Path Street in Medford.

1282
02:29:48,661 --> 02:29:52,604
I mean, this is deeply needed.

1283
02:29:54,164 --> 02:30:03,911
When I first saw the plans for the redevelopment of Auckland Court, I was really impressed by how

1284
02:30:05,043 --> 02:30:21,418
thoughtfully designed it was, the way the buildings were placed, the scale building up away from single-family homes into the higher density for the senior buildings in the back.

1285
02:30:22,038 --> 02:30:26,582
It's very attractive, so much more attractive than what is there now.

1286
02:30:27,707 --> 02:30:36,920
And, you know, what's there now is it's outdated, it's in poor condition, it's not accessible as people have talked about.

1287
02:30:38,357 --> 02:30:45,701
And it badly needs new capital, which the Housing Authority just has not been able to get for many, many years.

1288
02:30:46,681 --> 02:30:50,003
And this is such a great opportunity.

1289
02:30:50,964 --> 02:31:06,372
They've done a fantastic job of assembling the resources to and having the vision for a project that will not only address the needs of the current residents and improve their quality of life,

1290
02:31:07,585 --> 02:31:14,130
but also bring some very much needed affordable family housing to Medford.

1291
02:31:14,150 --> 02:31:21,695
You know, we've got one in five renters that pay more than 50% of their income for rent.

1292
02:31:22,976 --> 02:31:24,837
It's not an affordable place to live.

1293
02:31:25,078 --> 02:31:33,183
It's hard for people to find affordable apartments, and this is providing deeply affordable apartments.

1294
02:31:34,024 --> 02:31:34,664
The zoning,

1295
02:31:36,130 --> 02:31:40,971
we're being asked to consider tonight is what unlocks the potential to redevelop the site.

1296
02:31:43,031 --> 02:31:49,093
And I know there was an earlier comment about the operations and maintenance and how it hasn't been well maintained.

1297
02:31:49,653 --> 02:31:56,654
That is about the existing state funding and this is going to be funded with a lot of federal money.

1298
02:31:57,214 --> 02:31:58,315
Thank you very much.

1299
02:32:09,502 --> 02:32:10,343
Diane McKenney.

1300
02:32:10,363 --> 02:32:12,725
Hi, everybody.

1301
02:32:13,126 --> 02:32:14,527
I'm Diane McKenney.

1302
02:32:14,547 --> 02:32:16,789
I live at Carlton Road in Tewksbury.

1303
02:32:17,430 --> 02:32:30,301
Even though I do not live in Medford, my family has owned the lot directly adjacent to this property and is currently in a house directly in abutting this property.

1304
02:32:30,802 --> 02:32:34,005
So I feel like I have some standing in this conversation.

1305
02:32:35,141 --> 02:32:38,623
Um, aside from the traffic study issue, I mean, it is five years old.

1306
02:32:38,663 --> 02:32:39,424
It's been addressed.

1307
02:32:41,285 --> 02:32:47,349
I am not disputing the fact that that walk-in court drastically needs to be improved.

1308
02:32:47,669 --> 02:32:49,350
It needs to be gutted.

1309
02:32:49,750 --> 02:32:51,491
It needs to be ADA compliant.

1310
02:32:52,372 --> 02:32:56,954
There needs to be more affordable housing in the Medford area.

1311
02:32:57,014 --> 02:33:02,938
And in that area, my concern is with putting a six story building in that neighborhood.

1312
02:33:03,928 --> 02:33:15,416
They're from what I understand is 1000 plus petition from the neighbors that are in that area that, you know, have some drastic concerns and they really haven't been addressed.

1313
02:33:15,896 --> 02:33:18,317
I don't hear about any.

1314
02:33:19,618 --> 02:33:35,330
Any other discussions about maybe scaling back on the six story building or maybe making all of the buildings like a four story so that way you can shift and still have a reasonable amount of additional units to the pool.

1315
02:33:35,350 --> 02:33:47,520
But I just think that some of the concerns for the people that have been in these meetings, have been calling in, are just not being addressed.

1316
02:33:49,523 --> 02:33:58,407
And as I said, not disputing the fact that this is drastically needed, we just have a problem with the size and the scale of this project.

1317
02:33:59,007 --> 02:33:59,347
Thank you.

1318
02:34:09,492 --> 02:34:10,152
Patricia Berry.

1319
02:34:19,862 --> 02:34:20,943
And can you hear me.

1320
02:34:21,823 --> 02:34:22,064
Yes.

1321
02:34:22,524 --> 02:34:23,404
Okay, thank you.

1322
02:34:24,225 --> 02:34:30,429
Um, as I stated earlier tonight, I live on Taylor Street and method.

1323
02:34:31,090 --> 02:34:33,551
And even though it isn't within the 400.

1324
02:34:35,297 --> 02:34:38,499
Feet of this area, it is my area.

1325
02:34:39,339 --> 02:34:40,960
It is walking distance.

1326
02:34:41,861 --> 02:34:43,582
Walking distance to my residents.

1327
02:34:45,683 --> 02:34:52,287
There are numerous things that will affect the environment that will affect the area that will impact.

1328
02:34:53,247 --> 02:34:57,370
The quality of life for anybody in the area.

1329
02:34:58,587 --> 02:35:08,456
Neighbors in the area are not disputing putting walk-in court as to seniors or even affordable housing.

1330
02:35:10,638 --> 02:35:13,460
We welcome any of these people.

1331
02:35:13,760 --> 02:35:15,462
We welcome everyone.

1332
02:35:16,343 --> 02:35:20,987
And to impact my statement, I'm 65 and I am disabled.

1333
02:35:23,290 --> 02:35:28,634
I don't have issue with anyone coming into the neighborhood.

1334
02:35:29,514 --> 02:35:47,486
However, as stated earlier, there are over 1100 people who haven't had the opportunity to voice their opinions because this has been kept in such secrecy amongst those that are beyond that 400 foot area that are impacted by this.

1335
02:35:52,093 --> 02:36:00,960
due to just the overall congestion, elderly needs being met or being able to be met.

1336
02:36:01,721 --> 02:36:20,156
I would be interested in seeing how many times the fire department gets called into walk-in court, the police get called into walk-in court, and whether or not they will even be able to properly access that area with all the new development that's being pushed through.

1337
02:36:21,420 --> 02:36:29,164
And the statement that was made earlier in regards to... Hi, Patricia, apologies for interrupting.

1338
02:36:29,204 --> 02:36:30,684
Just want to let you know you're at time.

1339
02:36:32,365 --> 02:36:34,226
Okay, fine.

1340
02:36:34,646 --> 02:36:38,568
Conveniently for everybody, but okay, fine.

1341
02:36:38,828 --> 02:36:39,268
Thank you.

1342
02:36:40,729 --> 02:36:48,372
I would rather see this reviewed again to the public.

1343
02:36:49,051 --> 02:36:51,154
And give full public notice on this.

1344
02:36:56,541 --> 02:36:59,465
I believe that is all of the.

1345
02:37:01,628 --> 02:37:05,594
People here at the meeting, we have 1 more Kyle.

1346
02:37:08,252 --> 02:37:09,513
Yes, hi, thank you.

1347
02:37:09,713 --> 02:37:13,817
Uh, this is Kyle Joyce at 29 North street related to Diane McKinney who spoke earlier?

1348
02:37:13,837 --> 02:37:26,387
Um, I do have a few concerns 1 again, being the height of the building just because I'm at 29, the 6 story I imagine based on the direction of the sun and where the building is located, uh, would just shade out the house.

1349
02:37:27,747 --> 02:37:32,249
I know that's a personal issue, but it is six stories.

1350
02:37:32,309 --> 02:37:35,791
It does seem a little excessive for this kind of neighborhood.

1351
02:37:36,071 --> 02:37:41,053
I would request maybe a four story and then another building added onto the lot if possible.

1352
02:37:41,833 --> 02:37:48,175
I have looked at the site, the plans, but I don't know if there's any ground left over for that.

1353
02:37:48,976 --> 02:37:51,177
The other concern I have is the ground.

1354
02:37:53,615 --> 02:37:57,817
I just have a hard time believing that if a coal and oil company was there previously, that there's no.

1355
02:37:58,597 --> 02:38:03,119
Contaminants in the soil, and if they're going to be digging and doing construction for 2 or 3 years.

1356
02:38:03,859 --> 02:38:09,981
If there is anything in that ground, whether it's asbestos or because I know they called it the dump as like a slang term.

1357
02:38:10,201 --> 02:38:11,222
I know it wasn't a dump.

1358
02:38:12,022 --> 02:38:12,162
Um.

1359
02:38:12,902 --> 02:38:15,503
I'm just, you know, back then regulations were different.

1360
02:38:16,003 --> 02:38:18,004
I'm concerned with environmental pollutants.

1361
02:38:18,224 --> 02:38:19,805
So if we can't go over that in this meeting.

1362
02:38:20,325 --> 02:38:28,250
could someone link either the studies done, I believe last meeting, someone said that there was a phase one EIS done.

1363
02:38:28,990 --> 02:38:34,893
I would like to look at that documentation or any other documentation regarding pretty much anything with this development.

1364
02:38:35,254 --> 02:38:39,856
Again, as someone who's part of that 1,000 that signed this, I'm not against people getting housing.

1365
02:38:40,176 --> 02:38:43,658
I'm totally for it, but there are major concerns.

1366
02:38:43,878 --> 02:38:48,381
So if people have on their own time the ability to read what has already been established,

1367
02:38:49,230 --> 02:38:52,553
I think it would settle a lot of concerns that residents have, um.

1368
02:38:53,413 --> 02:38:56,716
Because, you know, we're directly affected by that again.

1369
02:38:56,736 --> 02:38:58,237
I'm completely okay with them building it.

1370
02:38:58,797 --> 02:39:00,479
I just don't want to be breathing in stuff.

1371
02:39:00,499 --> 02:39:01,700
That's going to kill me in 20 years.

1372
02:39:03,301 --> 02:39:03,581
Thank you.

1373
02:39:14,169 --> 02:39:17,492
Um, we have person.

1374
02:39:18,468 --> 02:39:24,850
A-N, Ann, if you could state your name and address.

1375
02:39:26,111 --> 02:39:28,111
Yes, my name is Anita Nagum.

1376
02:39:28,392 --> 02:39:34,734
I live at 9 Norton Avenue, which is within the 400-foot distance from Laughlin Court.

1377
02:39:35,834 --> 02:39:46,658
I've been to almost every community meeting, and I'm aware of only one change that was made in response to the community feedback, and that was the addition of a speed bump.

1378
02:39:48,411 --> 02:39:52,073
Um, I am in favor of redevelopment of walking court.

1379
02:39:52,173 --> 02:39:52,993
We certainly need.

1380
02:39:54,714 --> 02:39:56,235
Better housing for seniors.

1381
02:39:56,315 --> 02:39:58,576
I've been I have friends who live at walking court.

1382
02:39:59,197 --> 02:40:00,557
I've been in some of the apartments.

1383
02:40:01,538 --> 02:40:02,758
They need serious work.

1384
02:40:05,440 --> 02:40:09,482
There are neighborhood concerns though, and the Medford housing authority was.

1385
02:40:11,247 --> 02:40:15,189
and it still is, very unfamiliar with the neighborhood.

1386
02:40:15,849 --> 02:40:21,171
When they started developing this, they didn't even know that there was a playground half a block away.

1387
02:40:22,611 --> 02:40:25,272
They do not understand the traffic issues in the area.

1388
02:40:26,013 --> 02:40:34,476
When Route 16 backs up, people turn onto Auburn Street and cut through to get through to Winthrop to avoid waiting in traffic.

1389
02:40:35,342 --> 02:40:45,088
That is why virtually every street between Winthrop and North Street has been made into a one-way going east to west to prevent the cut-throughs.

1390
02:40:47,750 --> 02:41:03,019
If you put a wider road through Walkland Court, it will be a magnet for even more traffic, and it will increase the wrong-way drivers on the other streets between North Street and Winthrop Street.

1391
02:41:04,305 --> 02:41:08,388
and one other issue that the Medford Housing Authority does not understand.

1392
02:41:09,488 --> 02:41:16,993
The railroad tracks have been a dividing line between the residential neighborhood and the commercial district on the other side.

1393
02:41:18,434 --> 02:41:27,239
It is disingenuous to say that just because there's a six-story building on the other side of the tracks that it's appropriate to put one on the residential side.

1394
02:41:28,620 --> 02:41:30,882
I have serious concerns about a six-story building.

1395
02:41:31,482 --> 02:41:32,783
It will put shadows on

1396
02:41:33,857 --> 02:41:39,102
Some of the buildings, the houses need apologies for interrupting, just letting you know you're at time.

1397
02:41:39,603 --> 02:41:41,605
Okay, I'm almost done.

1398
02:41:41,665 --> 02:41:44,748
There are single story houses on that block.

1399
02:41:45,508 --> 02:41:52,035
And the property, the owners of those properties need to be respected while this development goes on.

1400
02:42:02,906 --> 02:42:05,587
OK, I don't see any other hands raised.

1401
02:42:06,547 --> 02:42:09,608
We did receive emails.

1402
02:42:11,068 --> 02:42:13,109
There's another hand that just popped up.

1403
02:42:13,689 --> 02:42:14,009
OK.

1404
02:42:15,109 --> 02:42:15,450
Dave.

1405
02:42:16,770 --> 02:42:18,270
Name and address for the record, please.

1406
02:42:23,972 --> 02:42:27,373
Hi, sorry I was muted.

1407
02:42:28,660 --> 02:42:30,942
David Peters, 17 North Street.

1408
02:42:31,022 --> 02:42:32,743
I'm direct butter to the property.

1409
02:42:34,825 --> 02:42:44,111
I'd like to reiterate what most people say, and the more than 1,100 people that have signed the petition.

1410
02:42:45,693 --> 02:42:48,855
And again, we are not opposed to the redevelopment over there.

1411
02:42:49,475 --> 02:42:55,540
We believe that the elderly and disabled need housing and that, you know,

1412
02:42:56,329 --> 02:43:04,195
These buildings over there certainly can use update, but we are opposed to the scale of this.

1413
02:43:04,215 --> 02:43:18,447
It causes, I can repeat what everybody else said, but I just wanted to reiterate that.

1414
02:43:20,574 --> 02:43:25,159
I think there has been no compromise by the Medford Housing Authority.

1415
02:43:25,199 --> 02:43:29,583
All the meetings we went to, all the proposals went in one ear and out the other.

1416
02:43:29,683 --> 02:43:33,046
They had their design and they were going through it from the beginning.

1417
02:43:33,867 --> 02:43:39,813
And there should be some discussion on compromise and the effects to the residents.

1418
02:43:40,534 --> 02:43:40,854
Thank you.

1419
02:43:51,716 --> 02:43:57,640
Right, I don't see any other people looking to speak.

1420
02:43:57,680 --> 02:44:18,874
We did receive emails and all of those up till tonight, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, Alicia and Amanda, we had emails that we put into the public comment folder for the board up until I think 6.20 tonight.

1421
02:44:18,894 --> 02:44:20,915
I have any coming,

1422
02:44:22,384 --> 02:44:23,604
Since 6-20?

1423
02:44:27,465 --> 02:44:37,908
Those weren't the ones that 6-20 were included and the only comments since then were actually Amanda or we had been clarifying people's name addresses for the record.

1424
02:44:38,508 --> 02:44:42,950
And so some responses with addresses came in, but not new comments.

1425
02:44:44,610 --> 02:44:47,211
I was trying to do a count and a summary,

1426
02:44:48,496 --> 02:44:52,469
of all of the letters, actually I'm very close.

1427
02:44:54,970 --> 02:45:04,178
There were a lot of them, there was one thing that was repeated several times in letters that I thought perhaps the housing authority could clarify.

1428
02:45:04,199 --> 02:45:19,392
There seemed to be comments that this was gonna increase the population and the car, the traffic by 250 to 300%, which I'm not sure where those numbers were coming from, but did you, can we just clarify it's,

1429
02:45:20,173 --> 02:45:25,717
Currently there's about 144 units and you're adding 94 units.

1430
02:45:27,959 --> 02:45:29,740
That's not 200%, that's not 300%.

1431
02:45:29,900 --> 02:45:38,967
I think one of the abutters was, oh yeah, go ahead Natalie, I'll let you handle that.

1432
02:45:39,688 --> 02:45:40,649
I was just gonna say that.

1433
02:45:40,869 --> 02:45:47,714
So we did see that comment going around and we do have projected occupancy for this property that's based on

1434
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:58,506
average occupancy rates in the Medford Housing Authority portfolio based on one bedrooms, two bedrooms for seniors, and then one, two, three bedrooms for families.

1435
02:45:59,807 --> 02:46:06,550
So we know historically how big the households have been who have lived in those units.

1436
02:46:07,331 --> 02:46:16,516
And so one statistic that I'd like to put out there is that for senior households in the Medford Housing Authority portfolio, 92% of all seniors

1437
02:46:18,467 --> 02:46:19,228
live alone.

1438
02:46:20,469 --> 02:46:25,493
So they're very small households, and that is the majority of the site is senior housing.

1439
02:46:26,153 --> 02:46:32,579
There's 40 units of family housing, but 198 would be for seniors.

1440
02:46:33,359 --> 02:46:46,610
So when we do the calculations based on these historical occupancy rates, what we find is that the increase of residents on site, it would increase by 101%.

1441
02:46:51,784 --> 02:46:52,205
Thank you.

1442
02:46:52,285 --> 02:47:06,632
And we could, um, uh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 of the letters were, uh, opposed and as a general rule, just to quickly summarize for the board, um,

1443
02:47:07,991 --> 02:47:30,211
They had very, very similar themes, concerned about being up against the train tracks, concerned about traffic congestion, concerned about, I think I finally had somebody explain in these public comments, the concern about the cut through, which I've never quite grasped because Auburn Street and North Street allow the exact same movement that this other road would.

1444
02:47:30,231 --> 02:47:31,172
But,

1445
02:47:33,690 --> 02:47:36,953
And apparently people then drive the wrong ways down the runway streets.

1446
02:47:38,014 --> 02:47:47,103
That is something that is actually very helpful for us to know that we will ask the traffic department to get better about being there in the morning to patrol that.

1447
02:47:47,964 --> 02:47:54,770
That's a solution that we solve with our police, not by limiting the number of people who live in a neighborhood.

1448
02:47:55,571 --> 02:48:12,339
There were also 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 letters in support, two of whom identified themselves as residents of the current Walkling Court, saying that they would very much like to have new apartments up to dated apartments accessible, etc.

1449
02:48:15,496 --> 02:48:26,202
I feel like those are generally what was in the letters, but the board has the whole letters, all of them at their disposal and had some of the earlier ones.

1450
02:48:26,682 --> 02:48:32,765
Most of these really apply to the site plan review concerns, in my opinion.

1451
02:48:38,488 --> 02:48:43,471
Madam Chair, we have a additional person who has not spoken yet tonight.

1452
02:48:44,375 --> 02:48:48,000
And page Lieberman on YouTube.

1453
02:48:53,787 --> 02:48:55,810
Sorry, yes, my name is Matthew can you hear me.

1454
02:48:56,851 --> 02:48:57,091
Yes.

1455
02:48:57,792 --> 02:48:58,513
Okay, sorry.

1456
02:48:59,154 --> 02:49:01,557
My name is Matthew page Lieberman I live in 15 Canal Street.

1457
02:49:02,414 --> 02:49:05,636
I'm extremely thankful for all the work that everybody's been doing for this.

1458
02:49:06,217 --> 02:49:07,398
I support it completely.

1459
02:49:07,418 --> 02:49:11,280
I think I've attended some of these meetings, been following the process.

1460
02:49:11,300 --> 02:49:14,643
I think it's been extremely well done, and it's very good for the community.

1461
02:49:15,563 --> 02:49:23,629
Thank you all for bringing this through, and I'm looking forward to the city really benefiting from it.

1462
02:49:23,669 --> 02:49:23,909
Thank you.

1463
02:49:55,767 --> 02:50:03,293
Madam Chair, there's one person who has spoken before previously, and there are no new additional written comments.

1464
02:50:07,096 --> 02:50:09,358
Cal, please go ahead.

1465
02:50:09,798 --> 02:50:11,119
Danielle, can you unmute Cal?

1466
02:50:12,315 --> 02:50:13,636
Thank you, madam chair.

1467
02:50:14,116 --> 02:50:16,138
Um, just 1 quick clarification.

1468
02:50:16,178 --> 02:50:23,424
This only came up after I was going to make another comment or question rather, um, when it comes to people driving on the.

1469
02:50:24,124 --> 02:50:26,346
Uh, 1 way streets in the wrong direction.

1470
02:50:26,986 --> 02:50:29,288
They don't just do that in the morning or during rush hour.

1471
02:50:29,308 --> 02:50:31,110
Uh, they do that all day.

1472
02:50:31,850 --> 02:50:32,070
Even 1112.

1473
02:50:34,592 --> 02:50:37,873
A clock at night, two in the morning, I'll be taking my dog out on the weekend.

1474
02:50:38,153 --> 02:50:38,953
They do it all the time.

1475
02:50:39,433 --> 02:50:53,577
And one other note, there are people that drive maybe 50 miles an hour down the lower address numbers of North Street on the Whole Foods side, and they will speed over the bridge that goes towards Boston Ave.

1476
02:50:54,177 --> 02:50:56,617
And that mainly happens at night and on the weekends.

1477
02:50:56,937 --> 02:50:57,878
They fly down.

1478
02:50:58,438 --> 02:51:04,039
So that just, you know, I've told the police before on the non-emergency line, but I haven't seen a speed trap.

1479
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:19,814
Um, but my original question was, in regards to my previous comment, um, you know, I see on the courtesy notice here from the community development board that, you know, there's the URL for the city events and the community development board under current filings.

1480
02:51:20,355 --> 02:51:24,419
Um, could you please just tell me with everyone listening because it would be helpful.

1481
02:51:25,340 --> 02:51:34,510
Is there a repository or a page where it has all of the documentation when it comes to the EIS and the site plan and everything else?

1482
02:51:35,491 --> 02:51:37,734
Just so people can look at that at their own leisure.

1483
02:51:45,825 --> 02:51:54,509
So everything that's been provided to the community development board is available through current filings.

1484
02:51:56,290 --> 02:52:00,172
I can put a more direct link to that in here.

1485
02:52:00,192 --> 02:52:06,875
I don't know that the housing authority has provided the environmental impact statement as part of this filing.

1486
02:52:07,775 --> 02:52:12,938
I know that also Gabe, if you would like to speak to, I know you have some materials on the house,

1487
02:52:13,358 --> 02:52:15,879
housing authority website, but I don't want to speak to that.

1488
02:52:18,401 --> 02:52:19,521
Okay.

1489
02:52:19,541 --> 02:52:20,202
Thank you, Director.

1490
02:52:20,222 --> 02:52:21,522
And that's it.

1491
02:52:26,205 --> 02:52:29,227
I can make a note about the environmental site assessment.

1492
02:52:29,247 --> 02:52:32,408
So we do describe them in the application, the findings.

1493
02:52:34,269 --> 02:52:34,670
And so

1494
02:52:36,099 --> 02:52:38,401
in the PDD application, you can find that.

1495
02:52:38,501 --> 02:52:51,652
There is, I believe the other term that was used was an environmental impact statement, and we don't, that doesn't apply to this project where we have our phase one and phase two environmental site assessments.

1496
02:53:03,441 --> 02:53:04,442
Sorry, thank you so much.

1497
02:53:04,542 --> 02:53:17,290
I actually was going to just refer to the actual application as read last as was noted last previous meeting on where the findings were and what is being done for environmental site assessment.

1498
02:53:17,871 --> 02:53:26,197
And at this time, if you can also just I'm going to refrain from the parking and anything else that does not deal directly with the amendment and outside of the.

1499
02:53:28,094 --> 02:53:35,640
The actual zoning itself, but if you can just tell us a little bit more at this point.

1500
02:53:37,622 --> 02:53:40,564
Just to reiterate what has been done.

1501
02:53:41,344 --> 02:53:52,113
As far as environmental, not so much mediation as of yet, but what has been done as far as environmental impacts on the site.

1502
02:53:54,244 --> 02:53:59,388
Assuming that it's not in the actual that no one has can grab it right now.

1503
02:54:03,070 --> 02:54:08,154
So, um, I see that has a way Valdez has raised his hand from person.

1504
02:54:09,054 --> 02:54:12,457
O'Neill did the phase 1 and phase 2 environmental assessment.

1505
02:54:12,577 --> 02:54:13,317
So if we could.

1506
02:54:14,218 --> 02:54:15,399
Let him answer this question.

1507
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:16,099
That would be great.

1508
02:54:16,559 --> 02:54:17,120
Yes, please.

1509
02:54:23,825 --> 02:54:25,026
You need to unmute yourself.

1510
02:54:25,046 --> 02:54:25,326
Sorry.

1511
02:54:27,027 --> 02:54:28,848
So, Natalie, thank you for the introduction.

1512
02:54:28,868 --> 02:54:37,353
And like, yeah, like, like Natalie mentioned, we've done on phase one and phase two to help people understand what a phase one and phase two is like a phase one.

1513
02:54:38,274 --> 02:54:46,459
It's kind of like more like a desktop review in which you go and you find anything that it's online about the history of the site from an environmental perspective.

1514
02:54:47,140 --> 02:54:56,764
And depending on your findings, then you come up with an action plan of, okay, what do I do now to figure out what's really going in, what's really here based on my findings.

1515
02:54:57,325 --> 02:55:03,367
And then you go to a phase two in which you actually put grounds on the floor and you start doing testings and borings.

1516
02:55:04,087 --> 02:55:12,051
And for people to really understand is digging into the earth, into the soil, taking samples and testing it for any type of contaminants that

1517
02:55:13,756 --> 02:55:17,998
were red flagged during the phase one, which is kind of the high level review.

1518
02:55:18,779 --> 02:55:23,501
So we've done that and now we are even going further to what it is a phase three.

1519
02:55:24,061 --> 02:55:28,263
Phase three is when now you've kind of like understood kind of, okay, this is what's on the site.

1520
02:55:29,264 --> 02:55:33,166
And now I need to fully delineate the limits of impacted soil.

1521
02:55:34,101 --> 02:55:48,890
As it was said before, the site, it's mostly comprised of urban fill, which it will have certain compounds.

1522
02:55:49,717 --> 02:55:54,458
that are regulated by state agencies and federal agencies.

1523
02:55:55,319 --> 02:56:04,681
And to make this short and to make it clear, what's going to happen here is that we are still ongoing to fully delineate the impacted soils.

1524
02:56:04,721 --> 02:56:06,722
There is ongoing investigations right now.

1525
02:56:06,782 --> 02:56:11,283
We are working on that right now, but we can't

1526
02:56:12,963 --> 02:56:25,291
go into construction, until we've had agreed with the state and federal agencies that regulate these compounds and the contaminants, an action plan to clean the site.

1527
02:56:25,992 --> 02:56:27,873
So the site is going to have to be cleaned.

1528
02:56:28,314 --> 02:56:36,459
And by clean, I mean that any compounds that are above the threshold, that's one requirement.

1529
02:56:36,599 --> 02:56:40,102
And number two, that are also above the historic fill

1530
02:56:42,138 --> 02:56:48,860
threshold, it's going to have to be removed and disposed in accordance with the state and federal regulations.

1531
02:56:49,200 --> 02:56:58,382
That means landfills or any type of special sites that will take the soils depending on the compounds that were found in there.

1532
02:56:59,002 --> 02:57:00,143
So the site will be cleaned.

1533
02:57:00,343 --> 02:57:09,725
So once this project is done, any type of compounds that are above the thresholds for

1534
02:57:11,553 --> 02:57:16,076
states and federal agencies or historic urban field is gonna be removed from the site.

1535
02:57:16,556 --> 02:57:17,457
That's a requirement.

1536
02:57:17,917 --> 02:57:20,859
Once we find something in there, there is no turning back.

1537
02:57:21,400 --> 02:57:27,204
Once we find something in there that is above any of these thresholds, we need to notify these agencies.

1538
02:57:27,644 --> 02:57:32,267
And once we notify these agencies, a clock start going on.

1539
02:57:32,707 --> 02:57:37,090
And we have now deadlines, like within this amount of time, you need to come with a plan.

1540
02:57:37,310 --> 02:57:39,191
Within this amount of time, you need to actually

1541
02:57:40,032 --> 02:57:40,673
take action.

1542
02:57:41,293 --> 02:57:42,835
So that's where we are standing.

1543
02:57:44,036 --> 02:57:55,026
Still more investigation ongoing, but we will make sure, well, as part of the process, we need to make sure that the site has been remediated by the end of the construction process.

1544
02:57:56,528 --> 02:58:05,296
And Jose, could you talk just a little bit about, like, there's always urban fill in urban areas because the land has been disturbed.

1545
02:58:06,202 --> 02:58:12,325
so that some of what you're seeing is not that uncharacteristic of just normal urban sites.

1546
02:58:12,405 --> 02:58:25,151
Granted, there are some uniqueness to this site, but if you could just talk about it in kind of a broader way about how similar it is rather than dissimilar, I think that would be helpful.

1547
02:58:25,612 --> 02:58:30,274
Yeah, so we have not found anything that it's not

1548
02:58:32,307 --> 02:58:50,759
common for for these type of areas right like once you have urban feel and especially back in the days it was not regulated so you could take soil from anywhere put it in there that's it call it a day put grass so because it was not regulated um state and federal agencies are doing their best to kind of like to try to like you can't go

1549
02:58:51,860 --> 02:59:07,794
and fully demolish a site just to clean it right it it wouldn't work who's paying for that so what the state and federal agencies are doing now is that every time a new construction is going to happen or earth is going to be disturbed they want to make sure that the remediation happens so we

1550
02:59:08,960 --> 02:59:15,183
A good thing here is that we have not found any real contaminants on the groundwater, like below any thresholds.

1551
02:59:15,743 --> 02:59:16,364
So that's good.

1552
02:59:16,464 --> 02:59:21,046
So even though there's some compounds in the soil, it's not really leaching to the groundwater.

1553
02:59:21,606 --> 02:59:29,630
So everything is staying within that buffer in between the groundwater and finished ground elevation.

1554
02:59:30,270 --> 02:59:35,453
But going back to what Marguerite was trying to make the point is that, yes,

1555
02:59:36,804 --> 02:59:53,473
I don't wanna get too technical into which compounds are here, because again, that will probably be a little bit harder to grasp, but there is nothing that we've seen here that kind of like, it's uncommon for this type of site.

1556
02:59:53,493 --> 02:59:59,236
So there is no real new concerns that have come up from the additional investigations.

1557
02:59:59,336 --> 03:00:02,878
These additional investigations is not really trying to

1558
03:00:04,302 --> 03:00:14,344
understand what's there, it's more trying to delineate the limits so we can fully understand how much volume of soil needs to be disposed during the construction process.

1559
03:00:18,705 --> 03:00:33,768
I would just add to that, just as a point of reference, is that for financing purposes, none of the parties that would finance the construction of this project will allow financing to go forward without

1560
03:00:34,576 --> 03:00:56,760
updated environmental reports that explain fully the current condition, environmental condition of the site, and to the extent that there's any concentrations of contaminants on the site that require remediation under state or federal law, they will require that you have a plan for how that will be done in accordance with those requirements.

1561
03:00:57,474 --> 03:01:05,942
so this project can advance in development in any manner that's not consistent with following environmental protocols.

1562
03:01:10,526 --> 03:01:18,353
And I'll just add having done construction for 20 plus years in urban areas that

1563
03:01:20,892 --> 03:01:32,178
You're always disturbing the soil, and it's really important to know what type of soil you are so that you can make certain that during the disruption of the soil, you have a plan in place to make sure that

1564
03:01:33,635 --> 03:01:37,557
you're keeping your residents and your neighbors and your construction workers safe.

1565
03:01:37,597 --> 03:01:42,500
But even more so, there's very strict rules around where you can dispose of it.

1566
03:01:42,560 --> 03:01:44,981
And so all of the soil does need to be classified.

1567
03:01:45,021 --> 03:01:47,362
And we're following all of those protocols.

1568
03:01:47,502 --> 03:01:55,967
And we'll have a team out there to be monitoring to the extent where we're disturbing anything so that we can be certain that

1569
03:01:57,328 --> 03:02:03,269
there is no safety or risk to the neighborhood.

1570
03:02:03,329 --> 03:02:08,430
But it's not unique or uncommon to construction in an urban area.

1571
03:02:11,110 --> 03:02:17,051
And I was just going to add that we can share the phase one and phase two ESAs, Danielle and Alicia, with you.

1572
03:02:17,071 --> 03:02:23,573
And then I don't know if maybe you could upload it as part of the PDD application and people can read those.

1573
03:02:23,873 --> 03:02:26,053
And if they have any questions, we're happy to answer them.

1574
03:02:33,431 --> 03:02:34,352
Thank you so much.

1575
03:02:35,272 --> 03:02:42,678
I'm actually going to, at this time, if there's no other comments that need to be read or there's no other hands up, I'm going to close the public comment period.

1576
03:02:43,219 --> 03:03:02,133
And at this time I will defer back to the city and just, if the city can highlight for us in a high level vote point and give us some information, give the board and the public some information about how these goals align with the city's goals, how this project aligns with the city's goals.

1577
03:03:02,826 --> 03:03:11,348
or I can actually, Danielle, did you want me to read those out or did you wanna touch base on them to give the public a better idea?

1578
03:03:12,808 --> 03:03:14,869
Yes, I'm happy to speak to that.

1579
03:03:16,669 --> 03:03:21,831
So the city adopted a housing production plan.

1580
03:03:24,511 --> 03:03:25,211
When was that?

1581
03:03:25,571 --> 03:03:26,132
Last year?

1582
03:03:26,152 --> 03:03:31,113
I think we got the approval during this calendar year, I believe.

1583
03:03:32,763 --> 03:03:50,090
That outlines several goals and strategies to increase housing production and meet our affordable housing goals, which is 10% of our housing stock is to be deed-restricted affordable.

1584
03:03:50,170 --> 03:03:50,971
We don't need that.

1585
03:03:51,031 --> 03:03:51,711
We're only around 7%.

1586
03:03:55,608 --> 03:04:12,840
So that means that we're vulnerable to 40 B's and not being able to go through these processes like we are now of being intentional of where housing goes.

1587
03:04:12,860 --> 03:04:25,068
So to make a zoning change, the amendment just needs to be rationally related to legitimate planning objectives.

1588
03:04:25,592 --> 03:04:27,674
and going through the housing production plan.

1589
03:04:30,155 --> 03:04:50,769
Two of the goals are to address local housing needs and meet production goals and work to meet the 40B goals and then continue to promote initiatives to address local housing needs, to promote a welcoming, diverse, intergenerational and inclusive city with an ideal mix of housing choices that offer diverse options to residents with varying needs and preferences.

1590
03:04:51,983 --> 03:04:58,386
And one of the strategies is to support the Medford Housing Authority to rehabilitate and redevelop existing properties.

1591
03:05:02,087 --> 03:05:15,653
And this to collaborate and support the Medford Housing Authority to redevelop and increase the units that existing properties were feasible, including Walkling Court, to create more family and senior affordable housing units with accessible and modernized housing.

1592
03:05:17,213 --> 03:05:20,695
And also, one of the reasons why we really do need

1593
03:05:21,626 --> 03:05:28,123
Family housing is, you know, although the housing authority has vouchers that.

1594
03:05:30,072 --> 03:05:38,173
you know, conceivably you have a voucher and you can use it to rent an apartment, a market rate apartment in the city.

1595
03:05:38,614 --> 03:05:50,656
But the problem is, is that there are no, there are very few apartments that they can actually use them at because they're above the fair market rent.

1596
03:05:50,856 --> 03:05:55,537
So they can't use it there or they are faced with just blatant discrimination.

1597
03:05:56,857 --> 03:05:57,417
Although it's,

1598
03:05:58,522 --> 03:06:07,329
it's completely illegal to decline to rent to a tenant because they're using a section eight voucher, but it happens all the time.

1599
03:06:07,929 --> 03:06:15,596
So we desperately need affordable housing and we need family housing in addition to senior housing.

1600
03:06:16,096 --> 03:06:23,402
So this is in our housing production plan, reference in our comprehensive plan,

1601
03:06:24,519 --> 03:06:28,429
and this zoning amendment aligns with those planning objectives.

1602
03:06:31,936 --> 03:06:32,536
Thank you, Danielle.

1603
03:06:32,596 --> 03:06:37,040
One of the things that I wanted to flesh out without going into full detail is the 40B statute.

1604
03:06:37,100 --> 03:06:45,146
I'm not sure that the public is fully aware of what 40B and how it affects SHI, which is the state subsidized housing inventory.

1605
03:06:45,666 --> 03:06:50,069
There's a certain percentage that every community within the state of Massachusetts has to hit.

1606
03:06:50,609 --> 03:06:57,915
And if there's not a low to moderate income housing that's met within a community, then

1607
03:06:58,375 --> 03:07:03,858
that community is subjected to a 40B, which is MGL chapter 40B, which is a comprehensive permit law.

1608
03:07:04,238 --> 03:07:13,922
And that's what Danielle was referring to, where a developer can come in and take your prime space and it doesn't have to follow regulations.

1609
03:07:13,942 --> 03:07:18,184
So this is a better way of controlling your housing when you have a housing production goals.

1610
03:07:19,325 --> 03:07:26,408
And the city can actually speak more on that, but I did want to flesh out some of the acronyms that we were using to discuss the housing goals.

1611
03:07:28,747 --> 03:07:31,848
Are there any other questions from the board at this time?

1612
03:07:36,469 --> 03:07:48,832
The general comment of, you know, I'm excited to see, you know, more detailed proposals once we kind of move this zoning forward, you know, incorporating a lot of the feedback that we've heard this evening.

1613
03:07:48,852 --> 03:07:52,173
You know, thank you to all the community members for speaking up.

1614
03:07:53,113 --> 03:07:58,334
And I think, you know, the next phase, we'll be able to dig into more of that potentially.

1615
03:08:00,901 --> 03:08:02,722
I agree, Vice Chair Hedeman.

1616
03:08:02,822 --> 03:08:09,308
As I said, it's not that we were neglecting your comments, but they're more specific to the site itself.

1617
03:08:09,408 --> 03:08:13,752
And this is, we're trying to get the zoning done so that we can get the project to move forward.

1618
03:08:13,772 --> 03:08:21,859
If the project moves forward, once the zoning is approved, then we can do our due diligence and making sure that it conforms to all city ordinances within.

1619
03:08:23,261 --> 03:08:24,842
So in saying that, if there's no other,

1620
03:08:26,388 --> 03:08:27,308
questions from the board.

1621
03:08:27,408 --> 03:08:38,131
Again, I feel very confident that Attorney Silverstein as well as M. H. A. And the city staff has already done their, uh, their iterative processes of going back and forth.

1622
03:08:38,611 --> 03:08:50,214
So I will ask for a motion to recommend, uh, the motion to recommend to City Council of the approval of the draft PDV three walk on court plan development district.

1623
03:08:51,274 --> 03:08:51,995
I'll make the motion.

1624
03:08:52,015 --> 03:08:53,635
The second motion.

1625
03:08:55,625 --> 03:08:56,705
I second, Sammy.

1626
03:08:59,486 --> 03:09:01,646
Roll call, Vice Chair Emily Hedeman?

1627
03:09:02,567 --> 03:09:02,847
Yes.

1628
03:09:05,307 --> 03:09:05,988
Ari Fishman?

1629
03:09:13,389 --> 03:09:13,809
Sorry.

1630
03:09:18,911 --> 03:09:20,691
They're not muted, but I'm seeing a thumbs up.

1631
03:09:22,132 --> 03:09:22,552
Thumbs up?

1632
03:09:22,592 --> 03:09:23,452
Okay, I can't see.

1633
03:09:23,492 --> 03:09:23,912
Thank you.

1634
03:09:26,393 --> 03:09:27,273

1638
03:09:31,714 --> 03:09:32,694

1639
03:09:33,594 --> 03:09:35,215
I shall abstain from this one.

1640
03:09:35,775 --> 03:09:36,195
Abstain.

1641
03:09:38,835 --> 03:09:40,856
And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm a yes.

1642
03:09:42,416 --> 03:09:45,077
Peter Cowles is a no.

1643
03:09:48,457 --> 03:09:49,858
Is an abstention, not a no.

1644
03:09:49,878 --> 03:09:51,238
Is an abstention.

1645
03:09:51,695 --> 03:09:52,895
Yeah, two abstentions.

1646
03:09:53,996 --> 03:09:57,977
One, I guess, recused in the same as abstention.

1647
03:09:58,417 --> 03:10:00,277
So we have, what, five to... It's five.

1648
03:10:01,677 --> 03:10:02,778
It carries.

1649
03:10:02,798 --> 03:10:04,718
Five positive and two abstaining.

1650
03:10:04,958 --> 03:10:05,158
Yes.

1651
03:10:05,958 --> 03:10:06,559
Five carries.

1652
03:10:07,519 --> 03:10:08,259
Motion carries.

1653
03:10:08,299 --> 03:10:14,420
Thank you so much, Attorney Kelson and all others representing MHA.

1654
03:10:14,540 --> 03:10:16,161
I appreciate you being here this evening.

1655
03:10:16,881 --> 03:10:17,821
Thank you for your time.

1656
03:10:17,861 --> 03:10:18,721

1657

Thank you very much.

1658
03:10:23,325 --> 03:10:24,746
Thank you so much.

1659
03:10:24,786 --> 03:10:29,528
Remind the public that this will be at City Council on November 14th.

1660
03:10:29,568 --> 03:10:45,815
Okay, I'm just going to circle back and see if any proponents of 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway for BOA has arrived.

1661
03:10:48,056 --> 03:10:52,718
Apparently there was a communication issue

1662
03:10:53,482 --> 03:11:10,430
Um, they had emailed me and then I got in the car and drove for three hours and they assumed that meant that they needed to continue when I was on the assumption that it's a go unless you request a continuance and he was getting on a plane.

1663
03:11:10,830 --> 03:11:15,072
So they want, they want to continue to the next, um,

1664
03:11:17,225 --> 03:11:22,808
COB, Erika Vandenbrande): To the next meeting and so we'll have everything hammered out, and so I believe that when the next meeting is.

1665
03:11:22,828 --> 03:11:26,831
COB, Erika Vandenbrande): The 18th.

1666
03:11:26,851 --> 03:11:34,395
COB, Erika Vandenbrande): emotion motion.

1667
03:11:34,415 --> 03:11:38,398
COB, Erika Vandenbrande): make a motion to continue without prejudice.

1668
03:11:39,951 --> 03:11:51,659
And to clarify, that's a motion for the special permit drive-thru use at 3850 Mississippi Valley Parkway, Bank of America, continue to 1018-23 without prejudice.

1669
03:11:52,600 --> 03:11:54,321

1670
03:11:54,541 --> 03:11:56,403

03:12:32,778 --> 03:12:33,859
I believe it's eight.

1687
03:12:34,460 --> 03:12:35,000

1688
03:12:36,370 --> 03:12:38,451

The final item before adjournment is miscellaneous updates.

1705
03:13:30,411 --> 03:13:32,192
Does the city staff have any updates?

1706
03:13:40,205 --> 03:13:42,306
I'm sure not that I can remember at this hour.

1707
03:13:42,326 --> 03:13:44,728
No, thank you.

1708
03:13:45,609 --> 03:13:50,032
All right, so before anyone else slips anything in, so we'll go right to adjournment.

1709
