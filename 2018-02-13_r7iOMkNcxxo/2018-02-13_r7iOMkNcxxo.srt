[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so any questions about that, anyone can come in.

[SPEAKER_11]: Would that meeting be televised since it's an open forum for everybody to come?

43
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:41,252
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not going to be televised, no.

[SPEAKER_04]: I got it, yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Prominence and we'll get it all over our media We'll put it out.

[SPEAKER_02]: Okay on the motion to receive and place this report on file all those in favor motion for suspension of the rules

58
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:20,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of order.

59
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:24,771
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion to take three papers, 3, 4, 5, and 6 out of order.

60
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:25,952
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

61
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:26,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

62
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:27,593
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

63
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:28,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

64
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:34,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Item 3, recommendation to approve submission of revised statement of interest to the MSBA.

65
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

66
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:36,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Patterson.

67
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:37,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

68
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:47,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so an overview for all the committee members.

69
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:58,815
[SPEAKER_06]: The statement of interest is required in order to show the district's interest in a partnership with MSBA for construction renovation projects.

70
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:04,376
[SPEAKER_06]: We did submit an SOI last year, and we were at the top of the list.

71
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:06,197
[SPEAKER_06]: However, they had very limited funding.

72
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,250
[SPEAKER_06]: only 15 projects were approved last year.

73
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:23,377
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are resubmitting with generally the same submission, but we have tweaked some of the language to be more beneficial to what we're doing this year in this phase.

74
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:32,101
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, the attached document is the required language that we need to provide and make a motion on to go forward with.

75
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:35,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Then from that process, we have the city council approve

76
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:38,201
[SPEAKER_06]: and then we have to submit via online.

77
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:41,722
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do have a hard deadline of April 6th.

78
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:53,345
[SPEAKER_06]: So timing is of the essence for this particular submittal in order to be on that docket for iteration and expansion renovation construction project.

79
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:58,506
[SPEAKER_06]: So the whole renovation is for the Medford High School campus.

80
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:04,588
[SPEAKER_06]: And the overall items that we were looking for are upgrades to heating and ventilation,

81
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:15,266
[SPEAKER_06]: some boilers, a roof, some renovated classroom and shop areas, along with other improvements that we have identified in the language of the motion itself.

82
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:28,711
[SPEAKER_06]: So as I've already explained, the document is the same, 2017, but with greater emphasis on our career and technical education needs and facility improvements that are tied to student learning and services.

83
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,732
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there are any questions on the language itself,

84
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:35,073
[SPEAKER_06]: We're happy to address that.

85
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:35,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

86
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:39,896
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to say thank you for putting this together and moving it forward again.

87
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,537
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's great.

88
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:45,279
[SPEAKER_11]: The more money we can bring back to the schools, the better.

89
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,884
[SPEAKER_11]: When we do the heating issues, will it also incorporate the theater, the little theater?

90
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:55,966
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we were just at an event there, and it's very cold.

91
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:56,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

92
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think it's mentioned in the report.

93
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:58,127
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

94
00:05:58,227 --> 00:05:58,347
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

95
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:01,810
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we don't get this money, can we look at that?

96
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:08,214
[SPEAKER_11]: some way to make that a little warmer, because we were there the other night and it was cold.

97
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:14,196
[SPEAKER_06]: So the HVAC facility itself is the issue, which is a major infrastructure.

98
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:17,758
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not a simple fix for just one area.

99
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:19,799
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are ongoing issues.

100
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:30,603
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's our reason for going forward with a larger project, because it's very expensive to do an isolated section where you're cutting open concrete and you're getting into those pipes.

101
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:39,212
[SPEAKER_06]: We are trying to maximize what we can do and make it a building-wide infrastructure improvement.

102
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:40,953
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is part of that.

103
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:41,794
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm all for that.

104
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:48,497
[SPEAKER_11]: But if we weren't to get these funds, we still need to look at some type of repairs in different areas of the building.

105
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:49,998
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that's for another day.

106
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:51,979
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for putting this together.

107
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:54,521
[SPEAKER_11]: And I make a motion to move forward.

108
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adopt the SOI, seconded by Ms.

109
00:06:58,283 --> 00:06:58,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Van der Kloot.

110
00:06:58,923 --> 00:06:59,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

111
00:06:59,123 --> 00:06:59,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Russo.

112
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:00,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Russo, I'm sorry.

113
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:02,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for this report.

114
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:08,160
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know when they will give us feedback on what they've approved?

115
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,101
[SPEAKER_06]: So the process, again, the deadline is April 6th, so then they review all of the submissions that come in.

116
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:19,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Last year there were over 100, I believe, total throughout the Commonwealth.

117
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,863
[SPEAKER_06]: We were on the short list of about 40.

118
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:32,536
[SPEAKER_06]: They did do a site visit and they encouraged us to submit again based on the need and or the potential funding that they would get this fiscal year.

119
00:07:34,156 --> 00:07:42,158
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're looking at the fall of 2018 when they would be voting for acceptance into the program.

120
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:49,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it would be a, the next step would be initial architect and OPM search.

121
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,520
[SPEAKER_06]: And so it's a very,

122
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:53,735
[SPEAKER_06]: long strategic process.

123
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:54,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

124
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:55,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

125
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:57,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Vandekloot.

126
00:07:57,296 --> 00:08:03,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for clarification, so for this initial step, all we need to do is submit this statement of interest?

127
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:04,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

128
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:09,298
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need to submit any more detailed report?

129
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:16,380
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is our detailed report in our required language that has to be formalized.

130
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,481
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I will need a copy of the minutes signed by the secretary.

131
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:21,921
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have to have the city council's vote.

132
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:29,755
[SPEAKER_06]: then we have to go online through the MSBA electronic system, and we have to pull that report electronically through their submission as well.

133
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:42,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we say, currently the building has many tiles that have asbestos flooring or many places which, while safe, when it is sealed, our intention would be to replace it, we don't need to give the number of square feet?

134
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:44,086
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not at this time.

135
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:44,527
[SPEAKER_03]: To general?

136
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:48,410
[SPEAKER_06]: They would have an architect review and do all of those steps.

137
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:48,770
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

138
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,731
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, OK.

139
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:50,151
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

140
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:50,632
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

141
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:56,757
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd like, I could read the resolution or would someone like to waive the reading of the resolution itself?

142
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:04,262
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion to waive the reading of the resolution and adopt the motion that we submit this SOI.

143
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:08,235
[SPEAKER_02]: to the state on the motion of Ms.

144
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:09,597
[SPEAKER_02]: DiVenedetto and seconded by Ms.

145
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:10,158
[SPEAKER_02]: VandenKloof.

146
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:11,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call vote, please, Ms.

147
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:11,219
[SPEAKER_02]: Kritz.

148
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:11,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

149
00:09:11,319 --> 00:09:11,580
[SPEAKER_02]: DiVenedetto?

150
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:11,680
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

151
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:11,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

152

00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:53,962
[SPEAKER_02]: On his paper?

247
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:55,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Benedetto?

248
00:09:56,683 --> 00:10:01,385
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyone to go with you to talk to the city council, please advise us.

249
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:04,846
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure there's many members that would be happy to attend with you.

250
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:08,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you plan on providing it tomorrow night?

251
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:11,988
[SPEAKER_11]: No, we needed to get approval and we have to get on their agenda.

252
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:16,970
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a deadline of 12.30 Thursday because of the holiday next Monday, if you're shooting for Tuesday.

253
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a good point.

254
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:22,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a good point.

255
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:39,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was roughly the same amount.

256
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:44,143
[SPEAKER_02]: $675,000 is the total value and we would have to look for city funds of $291,150.

257
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:51,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I will have to submit a paper to the City Council to cover that match on behalf of the community.

258
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,654
[SPEAKER_02]: So the vote tonight is that we adopt this Mr. Superintendent.

259
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:58,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And then forward to City Council for their

260
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:19,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adopt and move forward to City Council ah there's a motion is there a second by Mr.. Russo on the motion that we adopt you write funding recommendation and forward alone to the City Council and likewise I'll put a paper together for free cash for the offset of two hundred ninety one thousand one hundred fifty dollars roll call vote, please Yes

261
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:28,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

262
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:30,290
[SPEAKER_02]: 7 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

263
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,090

264
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Item 5, report on security system upgrades and funding approval.

265
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:37,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

266
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:37,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Patterson.

267
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:39,892
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, this is a follow-up.

268
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:50,976
[SPEAKER_06]: There was a confidential report previously shared regarding placement and repairs for cameras across all of the schools within the district.

269
00:11:52,563 --> 00:12:03,492
[SPEAKER_06]: are requesting the cost of all of the security cameras of $203,000 again to be brought to City Council vote for funding for that special item.

270
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:11,098
[SPEAKER_06]: These upgrades improve the level of security at all the schools, providing those very needed repairs and replacement of cameras.

271
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,183
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did vote in the fall to move forward with this project.

272
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,005
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, again, just bringing this forward with the new committee members.

273
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:22,629
[SPEAKER_06]: to reaffirm that action to move forward.

274
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:25,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Russo?

275
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:27,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion for approval?

276
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

277
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:30,055
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto?

278
00:12:30,136 --> 00:12:30,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

279
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:32,137
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the report.

280
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,579
[SPEAKER_11]: I second the motion to move it forward.

281
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:44,548
[SPEAKER_11]: But I also am requesting at this time to have an update on all the security as far as doors and locks throughout the district.

282
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:52,694
[SPEAKER_11]: So I know I mentioned it prior, but I am going to ask it, even if it has to be confidential or done in executive session.

283
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:59,298
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like an update of where we are and how we intend to move forward to make sure our children are secure and safe.

284
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,300
[SPEAKER_11]: Not that they're not, because I'm sure that they are.

285
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Doors and locks or cameras?

286
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:02,921
[SPEAKER_02]: Doors.

287
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:03,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Doors and locks.

288
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:04,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

289
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:12,127
[SPEAKER_11]: How many doors are locked, how they're opened, how many are buzzed in, if all of that equipment is working appropriately.

290
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:15,544
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, some buildings are harder than others.

291
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:28,367
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd just like an update on where we are with that and make sure that, yeah, building check, security check, like we did for the cameras, just to make sure everything that we have in place is operating well.

292
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:31,948
[SPEAKER_11]: And what we didn't, we purchased and made sure.

293
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:37,769
[SPEAKER_11]: I want the same thing for all of our doors and buzzers to buzz people in.

294
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:40,072
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a motion.

295
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:58,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the motion to adopt this paper requesting $203,000 that a paper be forwarded to the city council to approve the purchase of security cameras throughout the system and a B paper that all the doors and locks be checked and a report be sent back to this committee.

296
00:13:58,282 --> 00:13:59,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion.

297
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:01,784
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a motion by Mr. Russo, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

298
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:02,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Roll call vote, please.

299
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:03,705
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Benedetto?

300
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:04,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

301
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:07,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Mrs. Preston?

302
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:07,647
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

303
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:07,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Russo?

304
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:07,907
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

305
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:15,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, motion passes.

306
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,731
[SPEAKER_02]: Item 6, financial report.

307
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:19,293
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

308
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:29,361
[SPEAKER_06]: Included in your packet was a reference sheet for the programs in the general fund, so these are referencing all of your subtotals as you looked through your report.

309
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:30,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope that was helpful.

310
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:42,143
[SPEAKER_06]: As an overview, just to inform our newest committee members, the school budget operates and functions under a modified accrual system.

311
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:54,694
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is an accounting system and it utilizes encumbrances for reserving anticipated expenditures as well as tracking the actual expenditures to calculate balances remaining.

312
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:59,318
[SPEAKER_06]: So we still have many payroll reclassifications that are ongoing.

313
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:09,337
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a process that has been identified in terms of our payroll codes and our payroll system is not tied directly to our general fund.

314
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:21,265
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of shifting or status changes for placements of personnel within the district that not necessarily moved according to their general fund account allocation.

315
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:23,587
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that we are in the process of

316
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,062
[SPEAKER_06]: rectifying and doing a full-scale review.

317
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:33,404
[SPEAKER_06]: We have new payroll employees that are doing a great job to bring these to light.

318
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:50,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Additionally, we're going to be moving the budget amounts to go into the correct columns that were anticipated for those mid-year changes and to further improve the actual budget to the year-to-date expenses on this overall report.

319
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,272
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm happy to go through each category.

320
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:55,990
[SPEAKER_06]: or answer questions as the committee.

321
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:57,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Ruggiero.

322
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:05,475
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I noticed the price increase for electricity from a little over $0.08 to $0.09.

323
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:11,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to know, have we ever looked into getting solar panels for the school, or how much that would lower the cost?

324
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:15,900
[SPEAKER_02]: We are in the process of putting on solar panels on the Andrews School.

325
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,021
[SPEAKER_02]: That's already been worked out.

326
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,862
[SPEAKER_02]: The Andrews has a DPW facility.

327
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:21,588
[SPEAKER_02]: are getting solar panels.

328
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:22,989
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be the first phase.

329
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,470
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll continue to look into the other schools as well.

330
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,191
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with the life of the roof.

331
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:33,253
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases, they mandate that you have to go out and do a new roof in order to put them on, or they won't guarantee things.

332
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:36,494
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of little pieces that go with the solar panel installation.

333
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:39,595
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Andrews has fit the bill, and it's in really good shape.

334
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,776
[SPEAKER_02]: And that will be our first school to go solar.

335
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:42,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

336
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:46,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I just request a report on that mitigation strategy?

337
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:46,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

338
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:46,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

339
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:54,198
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a motion also to request a report on an update on the solar panels once they go in.

340
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:56,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Benedetto.

341
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:57,059
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi.

342
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:57,579
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

343
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the report.

344
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:11,042
[SPEAKER_11]: I did have some questions, and I know that certain areas within a department's budget are higher, and it all offsets by the end.

345
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:11,982
[SPEAKER_11]: I get that.

346
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:20,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Concerning to me is that I saw a trend in one school being over in a few different areas.

347
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:29,008
[SPEAKER_11]: And I didn't know if that was because there was a greater need this year at that school, and we allocated more funding than we anticipated and budgeted.

348
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:34,211
[SPEAKER_11]: So the question might be more towards the superintendent than it would be to you.

349
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:35,372
[SPEAKER_11]: You may know as well.

350
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:43,576
[SPEAKER_11]: I noticed that on page, sorry, so many things.

351
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:48,048
[SPEAKER_11]: On page 3 of 3, the secretaries at the Columbus, they're already at 116%.

352
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:57,612
[SPEAKER_11]: And then on page 4 of 13, at the top, it says permanent part-time Columbus mentors.

353
00:17:57,732 --> 00:17:58,892
[SPEAKER_11]: They're well above there.

354
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:00,453
[SPEAKER_11]: They use 376% of that budget.

355
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:15,805
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, in general context, a number of actual salary amounts need to be reclassified.

356
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:21,510
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not necessarily the exact depiction of what's occurring.

357
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:34,180
[SPEAKER_06]: We've done a number of changes and the mentors is one of them to correctly classify, but there were additional stipends that got posted in under a payroll code that is not tied to the correct general fund account.

358
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:40,569
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is what we are ongoing cleaning up to correct and show the truer amount.

359
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:41,850
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

360
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:53,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Because I saw it mostly, I can see it five or six times for the Columbus School in different areas, like PE teachers, psychologists.

361
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:56,235
[SPEAKER_11]: As you go through it, I saw a pattern.

362
00:18:57,555 --> 00:19:04,018
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just wanted to make sure that there is a reasonable

363
00:19:04,637 --> 00:19:05,457
[SPEAKER_11]: answer to that?

364
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,960
[SPEAKER_11]: I just didn't understand why just that one school?

365
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,740
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a plan.

366
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,043
[SPEAKER_06]: A budget is a moving plan that continues to change and evolve as the year goes on.

367
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,984
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's why the question is to the superintendent.

368
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:25,807
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Superintendent, were more funds allocated there because there was a need there this year?

369
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:27,848
[SPEAKER_02]: This has to be adjusted is what you're saying.

370
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:31,510
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a bridge that goes from the payroll system into the financial accounting system.

371
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,171
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people, the codes

372
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:36,886
[SPEAKER_02]: are carrying to the wrong line in this financial budget.

373
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:39,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're being corrected as we speak.

374
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're going person by person.

375
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:41,830
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

376
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:42,211
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

377
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:50,177
[SPEAKER_11]: And my other question was actually a request to see the community schools budget, because we're supposed to see that quarterly.

378
00:19:50,197 --> 00:19:51,758
[SPEAKER_11]: That was voted on a few years ago.

379
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:54,020
[SPEAKER_11]: And we haven't seen it yet this year that I can remember.

380
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,202
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a request on through you to the superintendent.

381
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:00,163
[SPEAKER_06]: Put it on your to-do list.

382
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:05,325
[SPEAKER_06]: We did identify that that is forthcoming in the first quarter of the new calendar year.

383
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:10,608
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got some additional items that we wanted to capture and make sure were included in that.

384
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:14,910
[SPEAKER_06]: So the plan is to have a late March report for you.

385
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:34,023
[SPEAKER_11]: When that report's presented, I'm asking through the mayor to the superintendent, could we also have, I know that a lot of the community is now using the program and everything's going through the computer program so we can find out how many hours we've donated and which schools are being used in which ways.

386
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:43,701
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could just give us a general documentation at that time as well, so we have both reports at the same time, and we can see how much, which buildings are being used throughout the community.

387
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:47,162
[SPEAKER_11]: Like if we have to put extra, you know, surprise the air.

388
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:49,342
[SPEAKER_04]: We can give you a breakdown.

389
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:50,242
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

390
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:51,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to see that data.

391
00:20:51,903 --> 00:20:52,883
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, that's interesting.

392
00:20:52,923 --> 00:20:55,463
[SPEAKER_11]: And as we use it more, that data will become more helpful.

393
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:56,904
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

394
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:01,765
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's a, I request that it's a motion to have that with the budget.

395
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:03,425
[SPEAKER_11]: I need a second.

396
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:05,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Russo.

397
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure what the report request was.

398
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:11,361
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

399
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:16,944
[SPEAKER_02]: The detailed use of the facilities by school, by item.

400
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:18,545
[SPEAKER_02]: The community schools.

401
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that falls on the community schools.

402
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:22,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's using which school and when?

403
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:24,368
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of activities that fall under that.

404
00:21:24,388 --> 00:21:25,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I'll second that.

405
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:27,309
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a second by Mr. Russo.

406
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,290
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have a question?

407
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,011
[SPEAKER_07]: I did have a question.

408
00:21:31,153 --> 00:21:41,799
[SPEAKER_07]: So for the things that are coming from the payroll system that are not lining up yet, that you're still working through, are those, they're not on here at all?

409
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,039
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, they are.

410
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,240
[SPEAKER_06]: They're within the budget.

411
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:53,765
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example, my department, the finance and human resources, there's a secretary that's being charged in the finance clerical salaries that should be in buildings and maintenance.

412
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:54,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I see.

413
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:57,046
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a true reclassification.

414
00:21:57,086 --> 00:22:00,028
[SPEAKER_06]: They might have been in this program area at one point,

415
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:02,419
[SPEAKER_06]: And their payroll code just never got adjusted.

416
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,923
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what we are scouring now at this point in time, now that we're fully staffed with our payroll department.

417
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:15,407
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's how, for instance, there's just magically no psychologists at the Roberts.

418
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:16,308
[SPEAKER_07]: But of course, there is.

419
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:16,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

420
00:22:16,948 --> 00:22:19,230
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just they're showing up somewhere else.

421
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:19,850
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something else.

422
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

423
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:20,650
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

424
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:21,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

425
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:22,892
[SPEAKER_03]: The next month should be clean.

426
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:23,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

427
00:22:23,532 --> 00:22:23,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

428
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:24,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot?

429
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:27,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Christina, I read your report, and I think I understand the answer.

430
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:32,577
[SPEAKER_03]: the public, we had some really cold days in January.

431
00:22:33,138 --> 00:22:36,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how has that affected our utility usage?

432
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:41,921
[SPEAKER_06]: So as of this reporting period, we had those utility invoices through December.

433
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:45,522
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's always a month in the rears for the actual billing itself.

434
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:47,322
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are continuing to monitor.

435
00:22:47,703 --> 00:22:54,525
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we capture an encumbrance of reserve for those expenses on the conservative side in these utilities to

436
00:22:55,187 --> 00:23:03,512
[SPEAKER_06]: ensure that we have enough reserved for those high usage time slots, which is usually January, February, for the colder months.

437
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:09,636
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are on track with what we have done in the past prior years.

438
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:15,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's an unknown what the remainder of February will bring and what March will bring.

439
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,342
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will continue to monitor those areas.

440
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:20,897
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, thank you.

441
00:23:20,938 --> 00:23:23,940
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file by Ms.

442
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostone, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero?

443
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:27,262
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

444
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:27,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

445
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:28,783
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

446
00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:29,404
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

447
00:23:29,424 --> 00:23:30,705
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.

448
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:34,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

449
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:35,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Stone, seconded by Ms.

450
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:35,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Kreatz?

451
00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:36,769
[SPEAKER_02]: All in favor?

452
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:36,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

453
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:38,010
[SPEAKER_02]: All opposed?

454
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:38,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion granted.

455
00:23:39,591 --> 00:23:42,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Report on Columbus School after-school tutoring program.

456
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:43,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

457
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:44,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Caldwell.

458
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:46,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

459
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,023
[SPEAKER_09]: The Columbus Elementary School began their after school math tutoring program on January 22nd this year.

460
00:23:53,764 --> 00:24:02,369
[SPEAKER_09]: Currently, we have 23 grade three students, 29 grade four students, and 18 grade five students.

461
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:09,353
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the grade level teachers, we have a special education staff member, Dr. K and Ms.

462
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:17,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Sherman Hudson are pitching in, as well as some honor students that are helping out, honor students from the high school that are helping out to make sure

463
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:20,851
[SPEAKER_09]: our kids can be the best that they can be in mathematics.

464
00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:35,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Each child was given a pre-assessment on the very first day, and the assessments indicated weaknesses in two-digit multiplication, division and word problems, and struggling with rounding off and digital enhanced topic tests.

465
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:43,932
[SPEAKER_09]: So we need to make sure that we do more work with our Chromebooks on a regular basis during the school day as well as after school.

466
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:45,203
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

467
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:46,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Kirsteen Patterson and Ms.

468
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:56,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Tatiana Hall, who is from Easton Bus, went out of their way and worked wonders so that we had the bus when we needed it, so I'd like to thank both of them for all of their hard work.

469
00:24:57,983 --> 00:25:08,727
[SPEAKER_09]: I was at the Columbus on the very first day that they had it on Tuesday, January 22nd, and I was surprised by how diligently the teachers and the students were working together.

470
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:20,912
[SPEAKER_09]: At 345, when the tutoring program was over, there were lines of students who was going home with their parents for parent pickup, who was waiting for the bus, who was going for the after school program.

471
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,594
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was all very orderly and very organized.

472
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:28,408
[SPEAKER_09]: I would also like to thank Dr. Kaye and Ms.

473
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:39,913
[SPEAKER_09]: Sherman-Hudson for their expertise in all of their organization, the teaching staff at the Columbus School for stepping up when I needed them to do that, the volunteers from Medford High School, Ms.

474
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:41,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Patterson and Ms.

475
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:43,875
[SPEAKER_09]: Hall for working diligently on bus routes.

476
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:49,197
[SPEAKER_09]: We all know that's not an easy thing to get done, but they did get it done in a timely way.

477
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:54,419
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, I want to thank you, the school committee, for giving us this opportunity

478
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:59,033
[SPEAKER_09]: to help our children be the best that they can be and improve their scores.

479
00:25:59,053 --> 00:26:00,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be happy to answer any questions.

480
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Benedetto.

481
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:08,776
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, I want to thank you for all your hard work to get this up and running so quickly.

482
00:26:09,676 --> 00:26:10,877
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

483
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:12,297
[SPEAKER_11]: There was definitely a need.

484
00:26:12,757 --> 00:26:19,619
[SPEAKER_11]: This program is exactly what we need for that school and to help us with our MCAS scores there.

485
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,160
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like a report.

486
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,543
[SPEAKER_11]: afterwards and see the growth from the students as well.

487
00:26:28,923 --> 00:26:39,530
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanted to know if anybody was tracking the last year's fifth grade students to who are now sixth grade students and what program or what we're doing for those students.

488
00:26:40,704 --> 00:26:42,604
[SPEAKER_11]: that didn't do so well last year.

489
00:26:42,724 --> 00:26:44,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Are we mentoring them?

490
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:48,285
[SPEAKER_11]: What's happening for them as they take the sixth grade MCAS?

491
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:50,526
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'll look into that for you, Mr. Benedetto.

492
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:55,827
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just want to make sure those children also get the needs and the gaps, any gaps that are missing.

493
00:26:56,187 --> 00:26:58,307
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't want to just do the next group.

494
00:26:58,347 --> 00:27:03,128
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to make sure the group that had the issue gets addressed as well.

495
00:27:03,428 --> 00:27:05,929
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm requesting a report on the

496
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:12,408
[SPEAKER_11]: current sixth graders who took fifth grade MCAS at the Columbus School.

497
00:27:13,888 --> 00:27:15,389
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a motion on the floor.

498
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:17,531
[SPEAKER_11]: I am hoping one of my colleagues will support.

499
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:20,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Report on sixth graders.

500
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:24,475
[SPEAKER_02]: We had requested that during our committee meeting as well, so certainly.

501
00:27:25,616 --> 00:27:26,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Ms.

502
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:26,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Vander Kloof.

503
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:29,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

504
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,220
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you, really, for all that work.

505
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Ruggiero.

506
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:36,203
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to know what materials are being used for the tutoring program.

507
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:41,329
[SPEAKER_09]: So they are using the Envision materials, because those are the materials we use in math.

508
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:47,171
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to look at the online piece, because I don't think the kids get enough of that during the school day.

509
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:57,515
[SPEAKER_09]: And any additional materials, I know that our special education teacher has some materials that she uses with her students.

510
00:27:58,116 --> 00:28:01,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you looking for more volunteers from the community, or do you think you have enough as of right now?

511
00:28:01,992 --> 00:28:05,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's amazing to have these high school honor students step up.

512
00:28:05,755 --> 00:28:07,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we have about six of them.

513
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:10,840
[SPEAKER_09]: They're currently working in the third grade under the direction of the teacher.

514
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,743
[SPEAKER_09]: But they're astute enough to take them to the computer labs and work with them there.

515
00:28:16,264 --> 00:28:20,748
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll keep that in mind, if you don't mind, if we need some more people to help out.

516
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:21,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

517
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:23,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

518
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:24,271
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustone.

519
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,913
[SPEAKER_01]: This is for you.

520
00:28:26,293 --> 00:28:27,374
[SPEAKER_09]: What time does it go till?

521
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,482
[SPEAKER_09]: So the students get out of school at 2.35.

522
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:37,707
[SPEAKER_09]: From 2.35 to 3 o'clock, they go to the cafeteria and they have a snack because they need something right after school.

523
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,729
[SPEAKER_09]: At 3 o'clock, the students go right up to their classrooms.

524
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:41,690
[SPEAKER_09]: They know where they're going.

525
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:48,035
[SPEAKER_09]: And it runs from 3 to 3.45, which is really just enough time for them.

526
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:48,755
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

527
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:49,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

528
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:50,116
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

529
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:51,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Russo.

530
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Diane.

531
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,122
[SPEAKER_07]: Did the fifth graders last year

532
00:28:57,977 --> 00:29:04,239
[SPEAKER_07]: had these less than stellar MCAS scores have particularly bad grades on the report cards?

533
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe they probably did.

534
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,420
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd have to check to make sure.

535
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:15,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you like to make a motion to actually correlate those if there really was any?

536
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:18,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we can do that.

537
00:29:18,643 --> 00:29:18,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

538
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:21,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a second on Mr. Rousseau's motion?

539
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,791
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

540
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:27,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion to receive and place this report on file?

541
00:29:28,114 --> 00:29:28,875
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

542
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:30,296
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

543
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:34,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And on the motions by Mr. Benedetto and Mr. Rousseau, all those in favor?

544
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:36,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

545
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,280
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

546
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

547
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:39,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

548
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:44,184
[SPEAKER_02]: The end of vote?

549
00:29:46,221 --> 00:30:00,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question to follow up on Mr. Russo's question really is, is for the students who are in the sixth grade, are we looking at their math scores, the ones who came from the Columbus, are we looking at their math scores and seeing whether any of them need extra tutoring or?

550
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:01,869
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Ms.

551
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:02,650
[SPEAKER_10]: DeVanadero's motion.

552
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

553
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,730
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

554
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that.

555
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:10,374
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to provide us with a review of what measures they have in place to help them.

556
00:30:10,674 --> 00:30:12,355
[SPEAKER_02]: That motion has passed, so.

557
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:20,254
[SPEAKER_02]: All righty, report on correlation between free reduced lunch participants and access to the SAT.

558
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:22,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening.

559
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,615
[SPEAKER_02]: If you move your notebook, it's just pressing on that.

560
00:30:26,675 --> 00:30:27,936
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

561
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:40,518
[SPEAKER_05]: At the last meeting, I was asked to investigate the correlation between free and reduced lunch participants and the SAT in the common application fee waiver.

562
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:48,351
[SPEAKER_05]: The report that was submitted to the superintendent on February 9th is the collaboration of the guidance department and myself.

563
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:54,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And a couple of big takeaways I'd like to just point out to you and obviously answer any questions you may have.

564
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:59,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Presently, 30% of all seniors who've applied to college have received the fee waiver.

565
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:08,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Out of our entire senior student body, 45% are eligible for the SAT fee waivers.

566
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:14,762
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have only 219 of the 353 students who have presently applied for college.

567
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:26,548
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is our expectation that once all these students do apply, we will find that to be full, that the full percent of the 45% of the students that would actually take advantage of the fee waiver.

568
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:31,270
[SPEAKER_05]: We have also, I think it's worth noting that in October,

569
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:38,254
[SPEAKER_05]: The guidance intern team came to me and asked me if they could work on a project.

570
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:41,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Every year they have to work on a project and action plan for their program.

571
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:47,343
[SPEAKER_05]: And their project this year actually was an investigation of this phenomenon, or this concern, I should say.

572
00:31:47,924 --> 00:31:50,586
[SPEAKER_05]: So I spent many weeks with them setting this up.

573
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:54,150
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that they worked with the food service program very closely.

574
00:31:54,607 --> 00:32:02,872
[SPEAKER_05]: And from that, we also have a variety of bullets that's listed here of strategies that we have already put in place to address this concern.

575
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:13,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And going forward, we will continue to increase the communication with students and their families regarding this really great opportunity for students.

576
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:16,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be happy to answer any questions regarding this report.

577
00:32:17,661 --> 00:32:19,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Mr. Benedict-Ngo.

578
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:22,577
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the report.

579
00:32:22,617 --> 00:32:29,482
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to make sure that all the students that were eligible were taking advantage of these things, and if there were any gaps, to meet those gaps.

580
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:34,005
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so grateful that you have those interns working on this project.

581
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,486
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems timely to me.

582
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:39,709
[SPEAKER_11]: And I like your moving forward steps.

583
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:41,090
[SPEAKER_11]: I always love to see that.

584
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:42,651
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what we're doing now.

585
00:32:42,731 --> 00:32:44,313
[SPEAKER_11]: This is what we're going to continue doing.

586
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:50,797
[SPEAKER_11]: This is our next steps to make sure that we're reaching every family and every child that may need this help.

587
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:53,063
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

588
00:32:53,163 --> 00:32:53,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Great report.

589
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:57,548
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would also say that to receive and place this report on file by Mr. Benedetto.

590
00:32:57,688 --> 00:32:58,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a second?

591
00:32:58,349 --> 00:32:58,890
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

592
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have a question?

593
00:33:01,252 --> 00:33:01,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

594
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,394
[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot.

595
00:33:03,655 --> 00:33:12,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you forward on to the committee members a copy of the flyer highlighting all the benefits students receive from applying for free or reduced lunch?

596
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:13,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I can do that.

597
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:14,504
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, I think that's great.

598
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:16,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would be valuable for us to see.

599
00:33:16,885 --> 00:33:17,726
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.

600
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:22,287
[SPEAKER_05]: I can also forward the action plan that was created by the intern team, if you like.

601
00:33:22,928 --> 00:33:24,408
[SPEAKER_05]: It has other steps as well.

602
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:24,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

603
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:30,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And one other thing I'd say is I think if we look at this data next year at the same time, hopefully we'll see an improvement in all the numbers.

604
00:33:32,431 --> 00:33:32,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

605
00:33:33,632 --> 00:33:34,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

606
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,213
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a motion on the floor to receive and place this report on file.

607
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:37,973
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

608
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:38,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

609
00:33:38,754 --> 00:33:39,494
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

610
00:33:39,514 --> 00:33:40,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion passes.

611
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:46,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Item seven, report on vaping information program.

612
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Turn me off when the numbers change.

613
00:33:55,493 --> 00:34:01,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Last Thursday evening, we had a really wonderful event take place at the Caron Theater at Medford High School.

614
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:13,500
[SPEAKER_05]: It was really the culmination of many months of work amongst the administrative team and the nursing and the health service departments to really address a concern that I think

615
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:17,037
[SPEAKER_05]: is vexing the entire nation, and the state, of course.

616
00:34:18,298 --> 00:34:25,020
[SPEAKER_05]: At this presentation, there were over 80 community members, including three of our own school community members, who were able to attend.

617
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:36,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was a really wonderful show, presentation, question and answer section, which really kind of got at the heart of the vaping concerns that we have in our community.

618
00:34:39,002 --> 00:34:57,426
[SPEAKER_05]: After the conclusion of this presentation, parents were invited to take part in a sort of a site visit, so to speak, an in-plane site view of a typical bedroom where students or children can hide items that may be concerning.

619
00:34:57,926 --> 00:35:03,387
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was actually really interesting because there was a lot of conversation and discussion that took place in the bedroom as well about

620
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:14,657
[SPEAKER_05]: not only the rights of parents and the need for parents to sort of, unfortunately, snoop from time to time and keep an eye on what their children are doing, but really specifics on how to do that.

621
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:26,466
[SPEAKER_05]: So the night went very well, and we sort of proposed it as a first step for Medford High School and the Medford community, because there was also people there from the elementary to middle schools.

622
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:39,377
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I presented in the report tonight was not only sort of the success of that event, but also the steps that we are taking, because this, of course, is a multi-pronged endeavor for us.

623
00:35:40,117 --> 00:35:47,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to kind of sum that up for you, so over the past nine months, we have spent a lot of time in our building really sort of

624
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:57,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting at the crux of this concern, we've held multiple faculty meetings where we've discussed the situation, presented it to the teachers to be on the lookout for.

625
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:05,514
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had community-based justice, CBJ, and building leadership team meetings on the same topic as well.

626
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:15,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And the CBJ meeting is comprised of not only faculty from the building, but also from the police departments and from the district attorney's office.

627
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:28,264
[SPEAKER_05]: We've redesigned our health classes where the health classes mid-year took on a different approach because of this ongoing concern that we identified where we're having discussions about this situation with students.

628
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:29,505
[SPEAKER_05]: We've also

629
00:36:30,817 --> 00:36:33,859
[SPEAKER_05]: look to the students to be leaders in this topic.

630
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:46,450
[SPEAKER_05]: We've conducted contests for PSAs and posters, which right now we're voting on to have awards for for students who present the best view from their perspective and also the concerns that they have.

631
00:36:48,863 --> 00:36:51,746
[SPEAKER_05]: In the future, we're going to continue to address the situation.

632
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:53,808
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not a one and done topic.

633
00:36:54,389 --> 00:37:03,279
[SPEAKER_05]: We realize that, for instance, a year ago today, none of us, at least in our building, had any idea of what this issue would look like today.

634
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,403
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're expecting to be a lot of changes in the next few months and years.

635
00:37:08,284 --> 00:37:09,045
[SPEAKER_05]: What we'd like to do

636
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:21,385
[SPEAKER_05]: in conjunction with the school committee is to continue the conversation on the community level by sharing information, presenting different speakers who can talk to that, as well as listening to parents and students.

637
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:31,556
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to collect and utilize data that is at our fingertips regarding the number of students who get caught vaping and the consequences that they receive.

638
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:43,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And also, and this might be the most important piece, we need to convey to the community, especially our students, the seriousness of this situation, not only for their health, but for their well-being in the school.

639
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:49,332
[SPEAKER_05]: If at this time I could take any questions regarding that at night, I'd be happy to.

640
00:37:52,193 --> 00:37:52,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

641
00:37:52,393 --> 00:37:53,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Van der Kloot.

642
00:37:53,193 --> 00:37:54,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Perlow, I wanted to thank you.

643
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:59,435
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a great presentation, and I was very happy I had the opportunity to attend.

644
00:38:01,962 --> 00:38:13,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Apart from the information that was presented on vaping, I also want to mention that I thought it was fantastic that we had students available to act as interpreters that night for people in the audience.

645
00:38:13,428 --> 00:38:17,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was just a great, great touch and something we should continue.

646
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:28,316
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if they weren't utilized, I don't know how much they were utilized that particular night, but the fact that they were available for people who needed translation was terrific.

647
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:30,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

648
00:38:31,997 --> 00:38:32,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Benedetto.

649
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:33,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Maverick.

650
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:39,180
[SPEAKER_11]: So there were two things that really stood out to me while we were getting information.

651
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,420
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was pretty much from the audience members.

652
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:50,884
[SPEAKER_11]: The first was a middle school parent who said that their child came home and told her that another student was vaping in our schools, in middle school.

653
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:53,085
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was alarming to me.

654
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:56,966
[SPEAKER_11]: And I appreciated her candor in saying that there.

655
00:38:57,815 --> 00:39:09,583
[SPEAKER_11]: The other thing that stood out tremendously is another student that spoke up during the meeting and asked for data to support what we were saying to her because she wasn't just going to believe that we thought it was bad for her.

656
00:39:09,943 --> 00:39:13,025
[SPEAKER_11]: She wanted data and backup to support that.

657
00:39:13,245 --> 00:39:23,331
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's, we have bright children and we need to be prepared with actual facts and figures if we're going to tell them they shouldn't or shouldn't do with something.

658
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:24,292
[SPEAKER_11]: So I was impressed.

659
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:25,912
[SPEAKER_11]: at that as well.

660
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:37,876
[SPEAKER_11]: What I'd like to see, and I talked to you a little bit about this at the end of the evening, is really a hard line, a very hard line that we don't allow cigarette smoking in our schools or anywhere near them.

661
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,097
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to allow vaping either.

662
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:41,958
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to have it in our handbooks.

663
00:39:42,218 --> 00:39:46,699
[SPEAKER_11]: They're going to be at our submaster, I don't know if they're still submaster nights, our welcoming nights.

664
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,400
[SPEAKER_11]: Our parents should know our routine.

665
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,501
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be initialed.

666
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:52,281
[SPEAKER_11]: It should be

667
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:59,187
[SPEAKER_11]: For a student that is vaping, we should show everybody, see, we're not doing this in MedFed.

668
00:39:59,468 --> 00:40:02,711
[SPEAKER_11]: There are so many health things.

669
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,694
[SPEAKER_11]: So vaping, you think you're just sucking in water.

670
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:06,154
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not.

671
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:07,035
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all chemicals.

672
00:40:07,075 --> 00:40:09,357
[SPEAKER_11]: And those chemicals are going into our children's lungs.

673
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:14,342
[SPEAKER_11]: And they think that this is a better choice than smoking, which is even more alarming.

674
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,980
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we don't know what it's doing in those lungs.

675
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there could be 40 different chemicals going into your children's lungs.

676
00:40:20,903 --> 00:40:21,603
[SPEAKER_11]: It's huge.

677
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:22,804
[SPEAKER_11]: It's very important.

678
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:24,406
[SPEAKER_11]: And everybody's cool doing it.

679
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:28,108
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, the way they hide it and the way they can use it.

680
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,871
[SPEAKER_11]: And teachers, it can be happening right in front of them.

681
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:33,893
[SPEAKER_11]: And teachers are supposed to be teaching, you know.

682
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:37,996
[SPEAKER_11]: You can't expect this from everyone.

683
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:41,239
[SPEAKER_11]: So it has to come from the top, the sides, and the bottom up.

684
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:43,140
[SPEAKER_11]: It has to be a whole community effort.

685
00:40:43,453 --> 00:40:43,853
[SPEAKER_11]: to do this.

686
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:46,935
[SPEAKER_11]: I was happy to see Penny from Team Medford, the whole group there.

687
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:48,937
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a great program.

688
00:40:49,177 --> 00:40:51,298
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish it had been better attended.

689
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:59,984
[SPEAKER_11]: But if they're not coming to us, then we're going to go every athletic meeting that someone goes to, it should be presented and every coach should be trained on it.

690
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:06,048
[SPEAKER_11]: I just think overall, it's going to be a bigger, bigger picture than we ever anticipated.

691
00:41:06,848 --> 00:41:12,232
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank you for bringing this up so quickly and seeing the need for it.

692
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:17,787
[SPEAKER_11]: And your team was excellent at everything, and Tony Vento as well.

693
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:22,731
[SPEAKER_11]: So even our school nurses were present at this.

694
00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:23,671
[SPEAKER_11]: This is huge.

695
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:27,434
[SPEAKER_11]: This is huge for our children's future health and well-being.

696
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,395
[SPEAKER_11]: And you were very proactive.

697
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:30,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

698
00:41:30,396 --> 00:41:32,818
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say that it is a real medical concern.

699
00:41:33,338 --> 00:41:36,381
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the big issues for us is that it's highly addictive.

700
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:42,045
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking at adolescents who are getting into an addiction that is

701
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,317
[SPEAKER_05]: as we all know, is incredibly difficult to break.

702
00:41:45,738 --> 00:41:53,342
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that requires the mental health and the health services department to work with us, because it's not something we just can punish away.

703
00:41:53,402 --> 00:41:57,244
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to sort of work as really a societal problem presently.

704
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.

705
00:41:58,865 --> 00:41:59,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

706
00:41:59,065 --> 00:41:59,405
[SPEAKER_00]: Kreatz.

707
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:00,185
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

708
00:42:00,505 --> 00:42:00,946
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

709
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:05,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, it was a great presentation, and I learned a lot.

710
00:42:05,628 --> 00:42:08,910
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was so interesting when Mr. Toomey was giving his presentation

711
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:13,607
[SPEAKER_00]: He was actually holding a device, a vaping device, and you couldn't tell.

712
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:22,673
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so discreet, so they come in just different shapes and sizes, and it looks like a pen, and it was really incredible.

713
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:28,016
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was Maureen who described what the vape was like.

714
00:42:28,356 --> 00:42:37,922
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're cooking a chicken and there's residue that goes all over your stove, how it's like that slimy film, that's what it's doing to the insides of your lungs.

715
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:47,766
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what, I just couldn't get that out of my head, that film that goes on your stove and just breathing that vape in and it's just going inside your lungs.

716
00:42:48,226 --> 00:43:02,498
[SPEAKER_00]: And then going into the room, the bedroom, in plain sight, some of the places that you could hide the vape and the juice and all the components were in plain sight.

717
00:43:02,518 --> 00:43:05,781
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a Pringles jar that opened from the bottom.

718
00:43:06,955 --> 00:43:10,816
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was very, it was, it was really, I learned a lot.

719
00:43:10,856 --> 00:43:14,896
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, it was a great presentation and thank you everyone.

720
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:16,517
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a great job by all.

721
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:17,197
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

722
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:17,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

723
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:18,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

724
00:43:18,497 --> 00:43:21,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a motion to receive this report and place it on file by Ms.

725
00:43:21,157 --> 00:43:23,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostone, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

726
00:43:23,218 --> 00:43:23,938
[SPEAKER_02]: All those in favor?

727
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:24,458
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

728
00:43:24,598 --> 00:43:25,218
[SPEAKER_02]: All those opposed?

729
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:26,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much, Dr. Farrello.

730
00:43:26,718 --> 00:43:29,019
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could say one more thing as well, put a little plug in.

731
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:34,700
[SPEAKER_05]: This week at the high school, we're also addressing another concern with us is technology in society.

732
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,220
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been, um,

733
00:43:37,255 --> 00:43:48,102
[SPEAKER_05]: showing to the students a movie called Screenagers, which really is about this addictive, another addictive problem in society is phone use and technology use.

734
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:54,226
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are also having a free of charge presentation for the community Thursday evening.

735
00:43:54,246 --> 00:43:58,810
[SPEAKER_05]: This is due to the PTO who paid for the services and the licensure.

736
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,491
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully you all also can come as well.

737
00:44:01,511 --> 00:44:03,112
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 6.30 Thursday night.

738
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:04,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

739
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:04,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

740
00:44:04,453 --> 00:44:04,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

741
00:44:05,014 --> 00:44:05,374
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

742
00:44:07,117 --> 00:44:10,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Next up is the report on focus groups scheduled for our superintendent search.

743
00:44:10,718 --> 00:44:13,838
[SPEAKER_02]: The preliminary focus groups will be held during the week of February 12, 2018.

744
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:17,779
[SPEAKER_02]: The schedule is as follows.

745
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:21,300

[SPEAKER_11]: There are two or three minor changes, and I just don't want to miss it if they need to be approved.

00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:25,489

00:46:35,595 --> 00:46:35,775
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

790
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:37,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm glad you told me today, not tomorrow.

791
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:41,538
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you go down to the last line where it says notification,

792
00:46:41,908 --> 00:46:43,449
[SPEAKER_03]: The word signatures is spelled wrong.

793
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:44,149

00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:44,870

800
00:46:57,958 --> 00:46:59,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Negotiation and legal matters.

801
00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:02,621
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a matter that we need to discuss in executive session.
