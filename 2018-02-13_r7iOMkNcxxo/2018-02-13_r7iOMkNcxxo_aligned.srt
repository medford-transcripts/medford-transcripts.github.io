00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:26,327

00:00:26,668 --> 00:00:26,828

15
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:43,660

16
00:00:44,472 --> 00:00:47,113

The rules are that anyone can come up, there's no preferential order, no one gets any specific,

Three to five minutes to make a statement.

36
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:12,342
If you don't want to make a statement, you just want to give something written, it'll be taken by MASC and it'll be brought into the thing as if it were oral testimony.

37
00:02:12,942 --> 00:02:15,123
Okay, so any questions about that, anyone can come in.

38
00:02:15,763 --> 00:02:17,244
We're advertised, we're out there.

39
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:22,546
The administrators will have an opportunity tomorrow to speak with MASC.

40
00:02:22,946 --> 00:02:30,429
The teachers will have an opportunity later in the day tomorrow and also they can participate in the general public if they choose to do so.

41
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:32,927
Mr. Benedetto.

42
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:39,151
Would that meeting be televised since it's an open forum for everybody to come?

43
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:41,252
It's not going to be televised, no.

44
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:42,693
It's intake for the individual.

45
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:43,993
OK.

46
00:02:47,655 --> 00:02:48,676
Mr. Ruggiero.

47
00:02:49,376 --> 00:02:50,637
Thank you very much for scheduling this.

48
00:02:50,717 --> 00:02:52,838
Are we going to be advertising this in the transcript?

49
00:02:52,858 --> 00:02:53,479
It's advertised.

50
00:02:53,699 --> 00:02:54,399
We put it out there.

51
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:57,061
I hope that we contacted you, Miranda.

52
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:57,541
Did you get that?

53
00:02:57,561 --> 00:02:58,822
I got it, yes.

54
00:02:58,842 --> 00:02:58,922
OK.

55
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:01,123
So hopefully you'll give it a nice online

56
00:03:02,372 --> 00:03:07,535
Prominence and we'll get it all over our media We'll put it out.

57
00:03:07,675 --> 00:03:13,158
Okay on the motion to receive and place this report on file all those in favor motion for suspension of the rules

58
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:20,908
Out of order.

59
00:03:21,248 --> 00:03:24,771
On the motion to take three papers, 3, 4, 5, and 6 out of order.

60
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:25,952
All those in favor?

61
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:26,713
Aye.

62
00:03:26,813 --> 00:03:27,593
All those opposed?

63
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:28,594
Motion passes.

64
00:03:29,535 --> 00:03:34,660
Item 3, recommendation to approve submission of revised statement of interest to the MSBA.

65
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:35,540
Ms.

66
00:03:35,601 --> 00:03:36,041
Patterson.

67
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:37,903
Good evening.

68
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:47,812
Yes, so an overview for all the committee members.

69
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:58,815
The statement of interest is required in order to show the district's interest in a partnership with MSBA for construction renovation projects.

70
00:03:59,255 --> 00:04:04,376
We did submit an SOI last year, and we were at the top of the list.

71
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:06,197
However, they had very limited funding.

72
00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:09,250
only 15 projects were approved last year.

73
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:23,377
So we are resubmitting with generally the same submission, but we have tweaked some of the language to be more beneficial to what we're doing this year in this phase.

74
00:04:24,137 --> 00:04:32,101
So again, the attached document is the required language that we need to provide and make a motion on to go forward with.

75
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:35,843
Then from that process, we have the city council approve

76
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:38,201
and then we have to submit via online.

77
00:04:38,662 --> 00:04:41,722
And we do have a hard deadline of April 6th.

78
00:04:41,882 --> 00:04:53,345
So timing is of the essence for this particular submittal in order to be on that docket for iteration and expansion renovation construction project.

79
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:58,506
So the whole renovation is for the Medford High School campus.

80
00:04:59,147 --> 00:05:04,588
And the overall items that we were looking for are upgrades to heating and ventilation,

81
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:15,266
some boilers, a roof, some renovated classroom and shop areas, along with other improvements that we have identified in the language of the motion itself.

82
00:05:15,826 --> 00:05:28,711
So as I've already explained, the document is the same, 2017, but with greater emphasis on our career and technical education needs and facility improvements that are tied to student learning and services.

83
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,732
So if there are any questions on the language itself,

84
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:35,073
We're happy to address that.

85
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:35,733
Thank you.

86
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:39,896
I just want to say thank you for putting this together and moving it forward again.

87
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,537
I think it's great.

88
00:05:41,697 --> 00:05:45,279
The more money we can bring back to the schools, the better.

89
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,884
When we do the heating issues, will it also incorporate the theater, the little theater?

90
00:05:53,224 --> 00:05:55,966
Because we were just at an event there, and it's very cold.

91
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:56,066
Yeah.

92
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,787
Yeah, I think it's mentioned in the report.

93
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:58,127
Yes.

94
00:05:58,227 --> 00:05:58,347
OK.

95
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:01,810
And if we don't get this money, can we look at that?

96
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:08,214
some way to make that a little warmer, because we were there the other night and it was cold.

97
00:06:08,414 --> 00:06:14,196
So the HVAC facility itself is the issue, which is a major infrastructure.

98
00:06:14,216 --> 00:06:17,758
And it's not a simple fix for just one area.

99
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:19,799
So there are ongoing issues.

100
00:06:19,999 --> 00:06:30,603
And that's our reason for going forward with a larger project, because it's very expensive to do an isolated section where you're cutting open concrete and you're getting into those pipes.

101
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:39,212
We are trying to maximize what we can do and make it a building-wide infrastructure improvement.

102
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:40,953
So that is part of that.

103
00:06:40,993 --> 00:06:41,794
I'm all for that.

104
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:48,497
But if we weren't to get these funds, we still need to look at some type of repairs in different areas of the building.

105
00:06:48,857 --> 00:06:49,998
I know that's for another day.

106
00:06:50,538 --> 00:06:51,979
Thank you for putting this together.

107
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:54,521
And I make a motion to move forward.

108
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,263
Motion to adopt the SOI, seconded by Ms.

109
00:06:58,283 --> 00:06:58,783
Vander Kloot.

110
00:06:58,923 --> 00:06:59,103
Ms.

111
00:06:59,123 --> 00:06:59,463
Russo.

112
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:00,544
Mr. Russo, I'm sorry.

113
00:07:01,798 --> 00:07:02,778
Thank you for this report.

114
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:08,160
Do you know when they will give us feedback on what they've approved?

115
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,101
So the process, again, the deadline is April 6th, so then they review all of the submissions that come in.

116
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:19,642
Last year there were over 100, I believe, total throughout the Commonwealth.

117
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,863
We were on the short list of about 40.

118
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:32,536
They did do a site visit and they encouraged us to submit again based on the need and or the potential funding that they would get this fiscal year.

119
00:07:34,156 --> 00:07:42,158
So we're looking at the fall of 2018 when they would be voting for acceptance into the program.

120
00:07:42,178 --> 00:07:49,980
And then it would be a, the next step would be initial architect and OPM search.

121
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,520
And so it's a very,

122
00:07:52,155 --> 00:07:53,735
long strategic process.

123
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:54,676
Thank you.

124
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:55,876
Ms.

125
00:07:55,896 --> 00:07:57,156
Vandekloot.

126
00:07:57,296 --> 00:08:03,997
Just for clarification, so for this initial step, all we need to do is submit this statement of interest?

127
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:04,798
Correct.

128
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:09,298
We don't need to submit any more detailed report?

129
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:16,380
So this is our detailed report in our required language that has to be formalized.

130
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,481
And then I will need a copy of the minutes signed by the secretary.

131
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:21,921
We also have to have the city council's vote.

132
00:08:22,389 --> 00:08:29,755
then we have to go online through the MSBA electronic system, and we have to pull that report electronically through their submission as well.

133
00:08:29,795 --> 00:08:42,845
So when we say, currently the building has many tiles that have asbestos flooring or many places which, while safe, when it is sealed, our intention would be to replace it, we don't need to give the number of square feet?

134
00:08:42,865 --> 00:08:44,086
No, not at this time.

135
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:44,527
To general?

136
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:48,410
They would have an architect review and do all of those steps.

137
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:48,770
I see.

138
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,731
So that's, OK.

139
00:08:49,751 --> 00:08:50,151
Correct.

140
00:08:50,352 --> 00:08:50,632
Thank you.

141
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:56,757
If you'd like, I could read the resolution or would someone like to waive the reading of the resolution itself?

142
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:04,262
On the motion to waive the reading of the resolution and adopt the motion that we submit this SOI.

143
00:09:05,552 --> 00:09:08,235
to the state on the motion of Ms.

144
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:09,597
DiVenedetto and seconded by Ms.

145
00:09:09,898 --> 00:09:10,158
VandenKloof.

146
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:11,099
Roll call vote, please, Ms.

147
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:11,219

148
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:11,299

153

Yes.

154

156

Yes.

157
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:12,501
Mr. Jones?

158
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:12,581
Yes.

159
00:09:12,601 --> 00:09:12,641
Ms.

160
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:12,761
Jones?

161
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:12,841
Yes.

162
00:09:12,861 --> 00:09:12,901
Ms.

163
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:13,022
Jones?

164
00:09:13,042 --> 00:09:13,122
Yes.

165

Ms.

166
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:13,382
Jones?

167
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:13,622
Yes.

168

Ms.

169
00:09:13,722 --> 00:09:13,903
Jones?

170
00:09:13,923 --> 00:09:14,003
Yes.

171

Ms.

172

Ms.

175
00:09:16,106 --> 00:09:16,206

Ms.

208
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:19,530

215
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:20,351
Yes.

216
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:20,411
Ms.

217
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:20,531

218
00:09:20,571 --> 00:09:20,631

Ms.

220
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:20,812
Jones?

221
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:20,892
Yes.

222
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:20,952
Ms.

223
00:09:20,972 --> 00:09:21,072
Jones?

224
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:21,312
Yes.

225
00:09:21,332 --> 00:09:21,372
Ms.

226
00:09:21,392 --> 00:09:21,533
Jones?

227
00:09:21,553 --> 00:09:21,633
Yes.

228
00:09:21,653 --> 00:09:21,693
Ms.

229
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:21,833
Jones?

230
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:21,913
Yes.

231
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:21,973
Ms.

232
00:09:21,993 --> 00:09:22,093
Jones?

233
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:22,193
Yes.

234
00:09:22,213 --> 00:09:22,253
Ms.

235
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:22,394
Jones?

236
00:09:22,414 --> 00:09:22,474
Yes.

237
00:09:22,514 --> 00:09:22,574
Ms.

238
00:09:22,954 --> 00:09:25,275
Yes, seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

239
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,015
Motion passes.

240
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:34,297
Also, the superintendent is recommending we take a vote, that we move this paper along to the city council for their vote and their thoughts on this.

241
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:38,558
Motion by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

242
00:09:38,638 --> 00:09:39,438
Roll call vote, Ms.

243
00:09:39,459 --> 00:09:48,401
Kretz.

244
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:51,302
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

245
00:09:51,342 --> 00:09:52,062
Motion passes.

246
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:53,962
On his paper?

247
00:09:54,883 --> 00:09:55,623
Mr. Benedetto?

248
00:09:56,683 --> 00:10:01,385
Anyone to go with you to talk to the city council, please advise us.

249
00:10:01,445 --> 00:10:04,846
I'm sure there's many members that would be happy to attend with you.

250
00:10:05,726 --> 00:10:08,267
Do you plan on providing it tomorrow night?

251
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:11,988
No, we needed to get approval and we have to get on their agenda.

252
00:10:12,008 --> 00:10:16,970
There's a deadline of 12.30 Thursday because of the holiday next Monday, if you're shooting for Tuesday.

253
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:19,464
I think that's a good point.

254
00:10:19,704 --> 00:10:22,586
I think that's a good point.

255
00:10:37,077 --> 00:10:39,579
I think it was roughly the same amount.

256
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:44,143
$675,000 is the total value and we would have to look for city funds of $291,150.

257
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:51,150
I will have to submit a paper to the City Council to cover that match on behalf of the community.

258
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,654
So the vote tonight is that we adopt this Mr. Superintendent.

259
00:10:56,294 --> 00:10:58,036
And then forward to City Council for their

260
00:10:58,498 --> 00:11:19,981
Motion to adopt and move forward to City Council ah there's a motion is there a second by Mr.. Russo on the motion that we adopt you write funding recommendation and forward alone to the City Council and likewise I'll put a paper together for free cash for the offset of two hundred ninety one thousand one hundred fifty dollars roll call vote, please Yes

261
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:28,489
Yes.

262
00:11:28,509 --> 00:11:30,290
7 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

263
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,090
Motion passes.

264
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,811
Item 5, report on security system upgrades and funding approval.

265
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:37,332
Ms.

266
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:37,732
Patterson.

267
00:11:38,352 --> 00:11:39,892
So again, this is a follow-up.

268
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:50,976
There was a confidential report previously shared regarding placement and repairs for cameras across all of the schools within the district.

269
00:11:52,563 --> 00:12:03,492
are requesting the cost of all of the security cameras of $203,000 again to be brought to City Council vote for funding for that special item.

270
00:12:04,213 --> 00:12:11,098
These upgrades improve the level of security at all the schools, providing those very needed repairs and replacement of cameras.

271
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,183
So we did vote in the fall to move forward with this project.

272
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:19,005
This is, again, just bringing this forward with the new committee members.

273
00:12:19,486 --> 00:12:22,629
to reaffirm that action to move forward.

274
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:25,632
Mr. Russo?

275
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:27,753
Motion for approval?

276
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:29,455
Yes.

277
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:30,055
Mr. Benedetto?

278
00:12:30,136 --> 00:12:30,556
Thank you.

279
00:12:30,636 --> 00:12:32,137
Thank you for the report.

280
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,579
I second the motion to move it forward.

281
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:44,548
But I also am requesting at this time to have an update on all the security as far as doors and locks throughout the district.

282
00:12:45,969 --> 00:12:52,694
So I know I mentioned it prior, but I am going to ask it, even if it has to be confidential or done in executive session.

283
00:12:53,054 --> 00:12:59,298
I'd like an update of where we are and how we intend to move forward to make sure our children are secure and safe.

284
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:01,300
Not that they're not, because I'm sure that they are.

285
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,140
Doors and locks or cameras?

286
00:13:02,561 --> 00:13:02,921
Doors.

287
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:03,881
Doors and locks.

288
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:04,302
Yeah.

289
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:12,127
How many doors are locked, how they're opened, how many are buzzed in, if all of that equipment is working appropriately.

290
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:15,544
You know, some buildings are harder than others.

291
00:13:15,604 --> 00:13:28,367
I'd just like an update on where we are with that and make sure that, yeah, building check, security check, like we did for the cameras, just to make sure everything that we have in place is operating well.

292
00:13:28,747 --> 00:13:31,948
And what we didn't, we purchased and made sure.

293
00:13:31,968 --> 00:13:37,769
I want the same thing for all of our doors and buzzers to buzz people in.

294
00:13:39,372 --> 00:13:40,072
So there's a motion.

295
00:13:40,092 --> 00:13:58,262
I'm the motion to adopt this paper requesting $203,000 that a paper be forwarded to the city council to approve the purchase of security cameras throughout the system and a B paper that all the doors and locks be checked and a report be sent back to this committee.

296
00:13:58,282 --> 00:13:59,082
Motion.

297
00:13:59,102 --> 00:14:01,784
There's a motion by Mr. Russo, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

298
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:02,684
Roll call vote, please.

299
00:14:02,704 --> 00:14:03,705
Mr. Benedetto?

300
00:14:04,045 --> 00:14:04,385
Yes.

301
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:07,567
Mrs. Preston?

302
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:07,647
Yes.

303
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:07,827
Mr. Russo?

304
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:07,907
Yes.

305
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:15,029
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative, motion passes.

306
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,731
Item 6, financial report.

307
00:14:17,751 --> 00:14:19,293
Okay, thank you.

308
00:14:20,013 --> 00:14:29,361
Included in your packet was a reference sheet for the programs in the general fund, so these are referencing all of your subtotals as you looked through your report.

309
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:30,382
I hope that was helpful.

310
00:14:31,775 --> 00:14:42,143
As an overview, just to inform our newest committee members, the school budget operates and functions under a modified accrual system.

311
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:54,694
So this is an accounting system and it utilizes encumbrances for reserving anticipated expenditures as well as tracking the actual expenditures to calculate balances remaining.

312
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:59,318
So we still have many payroll reclassifications that are ongoing.

313
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:09,337
This is a process that has been identified in terms of our payroll codes and our payroll system is not tied directly to our general fund.

314
00:15:09,677 --> 00:15:21,265
So there's a lot of shifting or status changes for placements of personnel within the district that not necessarily moved according to their general fund account allocation.

315
00:15:21,646 --> 00:15:23,587
That's something that we are in the process of

316
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:28,062
rectifying and doing a full-scale review.

317
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:33,404
We have new payroll employees that are doing a great job to bring these to light.

318
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:50,071
Additionally, we're going to be moving the budget amounts to go into the correct columns that were anticipated for those mid-year changes and to further improve the actual budget to the year-to-date expenses on this overall report.

319
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,272
So I'm happy to go through each category.

320
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:55,990
or answer questions as the committee.

321
00:15:57,111 --> 00:15:57,851
Mr. Ruggiero.

322
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:05,475
Yeah, I noticed the price increase for electricity from a little over $0.08 to $0.09.

323
00:16:06,415 --> 00:16:11,338
I wanted to know, have we ever looked into getting solar panels for the school, or how much that would lower the cost?

324
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:15,900
We are in the process of putting on solar panels on the Andrews School.

325
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,021
That's already been worked out.

326
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:19,862
The Andrews has a DPW facility.

327
00:16:20,508 --> 00:16:21,588
are getting solar panels.

328
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:22,989
That'll be the first phase.

329
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:25,470
And then we'll continue to look into the other schools as well.

330
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,191
It has to do with the life of the roof.

331
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:33,253
In some cases, they mandate that you have to go out and do a new roof in order to put them on, or they won't guarantee things.

332
00:16:33,293 --> 00:16:36,494
So there's a lot of little pieces that go with the solar panel installation.

333
00:16:37,114 --> 00:16:39,595
But the Andrews has fit the bill, and it's in really good shape.

334
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:41,776
And that will be our first school to go solar.

335
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:42,256
Great.

336
00:16:42,356 --> 00:16:46,018
Can I just request a report on that mitigation strategy?

337
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:46,618
Sure.

338
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:46,838
Thanks.

339
00:16:48,737 --> 00:16:54,198
There's a motion also to request a report on an update on the solar panels once they go in.

340
00:16:55,638 --> 00:16:56,299
Mr. Benedetto.

341
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:57,059
Hi.

342
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:57,579
Thank you.

343
00:16:57,999 --> 00:16:59,019
Thank you for the report.

344
00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:11,042
I did have some questions, and I know that certain areas within a department's budget are higher, and it all offsets by the end.

345
00:17:11,582 --> 00:17:11,982
I get that.

346
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:20,864
Concerning to me is that I saw a trend in one school being over in a few different areas.

347
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:29,008
And I didn't know if that was because there was a greater need this year at that school, and we allocated more funding than we anticipated and budgeted.

348
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:34,211
So the question might be more towards the superintendent than it would be to you.

349
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:35,372
You may know as well.

350
00:17:35,752 --> 00:17:43,576
I noticed that on page, sorry, so many things.

351
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:48,048
On page 3 of 3, the secretaries at the Columbus, they're already at 116%.

352
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:57,612
And then on page 4 of 13, at the top, it says permanent part-time Columbus mentors.

353
00:17:57,732 --> 00:17:58,892
They're well above there.

354
00:17:59,652 --> 00:18:00,453
They use 376% of that budget.

355
00:18:07,678 --> 00:18:15,805
So again, in general context, a number of actual salary amounts need to be reclassified.

356
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:21,510
So it's not necessarily the exact depiction of what's occurring.

357
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:34,180
We've done a number of changes and the mentors is one of them to correctly classify, but there were additional stipends that got posted in under a payroll code that is not tied to the correct general fund account.

358
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:40,569
So that is what we are ongoing cleaning up to correct and show the truer amount.

359
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:41,850
OK.

360
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:53,314
Because I saw it mostly, I can see it five or six times for the Columbus School in different areas, like PE teachers, psychologists.

361
00:18:54,254 --> 00:18:56,235
As you go through it, I saw a pattern.

362
00:18:57,555 --> 00:19:04,018
And I just wanted to make sure that there is a reasonable

363
00:19:04,637 --> 00:19:05,457
answer to that?

364
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,960
I just didn't understand why just that one school?

365
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,740
It's a plan.

366
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,043
A budget is a moving plan that continues to change and evolve as the year goes on.

367
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,984
And that's why the question is to the superintendent.

368
00:19:20,665 --> 00:19:25,807
Mr. Superintendent, were more funds allocated there because there was a need there this year?

369
00:19:25,827 --> 00:19:27,848
This has to be adjusted is what you're saying.

370
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:31,510
There's a bridge that goes from the payroll system into the financial accounting system.

371
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:33,171
And some people, the codes

372
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:36,886
are carrying to the wrong line in this financial budget.

373
00:19:36,907 --> 00:19:39,629
So they're being corrected as we speak.

374
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:41,510
So they're going person by person.

375
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:41,830
Yes.

376
00:19:42,011 --> 00:19:42,211
All right.

377
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:50,177
And my other question was actually a request to see the community schools budget, because we're supposed to see that quarterly.

378
00:19:50,197 --> 00:19:51,758
That was voted on a few years ago.

379
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:54,020
And we haven't seen it yet this year that I can remember.

380
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:58,202
So there's a request on through you to the superintendent.

381
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:00,163
Put it on your to-do list.

382
00:20:01,163 --> 00:20:05,325
We did identify that that is forthcoming in the first quarter of the new calendar year.

383
00:20:05,726 --> 00:20:10,608
We've got some additional items that we wanted to capture and make sure were included in that.

384
00:20:10,688 --> 00:20:14,910
So the plan is to have a late March report for you.

385
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:34,023
When that report's presented, I'm asking through the mayor to the superintendent, could we also have, I know that a lot of the community is now using the program and everything's going through the computer program so we can find out how many hours we've donated and which schools are being used in which ways.

386
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:43,701
If you could just give us a general documentation at that time as well, so we have both reports at the same time, and we can see how much, which buildings are being used throughout the community.

387
00:20:44,001 --> 00:20:47,162
Like if we have to put extra, you know, surprise the air.

388
00:20:47,202 --> 00:20:49,342
We can give you a breakdown.

389
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:50,242
Thank you.

390
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:51,823
I'd like to see that data.

391
00:20:51,903 --> 00:20:52,883
I mean, that's interesting.

392
00:20:52,923 --> 00:20:55,463
And as we use it more, that data will become more helpful.

393
00:20:56,504 --> 00:20:56,904
Thank you.

394
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:01,765
So that's a, I request that it's a motion to have that with the budget.

395
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:03,425
I need a second.

396
00:21:05,018 --> 00:21:05,738
Mr. Russo.

397
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,741
I'm not sure what the report request was.

398
00:21:10,941 --> 00:21:11,361
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:16,944
The detailed use of the facilities by school, by item.

400
00:21:17,384 --> 00:21:18,545
The community schools.

401
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,326
Anything that falls on the community schools.

402
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:22,107
Who's using which school and when?

403
00:21:22,507 --> 00:21:24,368
There's a lot of activities that fall under that.

404
00:21:24,388 --> 00:21:25,749
Sure, I'll second that.

405
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:27,309
It is a second by Mr. Russo.

406
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,290
Did you have a question?

407
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,011
I did have a question.

408
00:21:31,153 --> 00:21:41,799
So for the things that are coming from the payroll system that are not lining up yet, that you're still working through, are those, they're not on here at all?

409
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:43,039
No, no, they are.

410
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,240
They're within the budget.

411
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:53,765
So for example, my department, the finance and human resources, there's a secretary that's being charged in the finance clerical salaries that should be in buildings and maintenance.

412
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:54,765
I see.

413
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:57,046
So it's a true reclassification.

414
00:21:57,086 --> 00:22:00,028
They might have been in this program area at one point,

415
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:02,419
And their payroll code just never got adjusted.

416
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,923
So that's what we are scouring now at this point in time, now that we're fully staffed with our payroll department.

417
00:22:09,404 --> 00:22:15,407
So that's how, for instance, there's just magically no psychologists at the Roberts.

418
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:16,308
But of course, there is.

419
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:16,788
Yes.

420
00:22:16,948 --> 00:22:19,230
It's just they're showing up somewhere else.

421
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:19,850
It's something else.

422
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,150
Correct.

423
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:20,650
OK.

424
00:22:21,031 --> 00:22:21,351
Thank you.

425
00:22:21,791 --> 00:22:22,892
The next month should be clean.

426
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:23,112
Yes.

427
00:22:23,532 --> 00:22:23,672
Ms.

428
00:22:23,692 --> 00:22:24,273
Van de Kloot?

429
00:22:24,813 --> 00:22:27,315
Christina, I read your report, and I think I understand the answer.

430
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:32,577
the public, we had some really cold days in January.

431
00:22:33,138 --> 00:22:36,579
And so how has that affected our utility usage?

432
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:41,921
So as of this reporting period, we had those utility invoices through December.

433
00:22:42,201 --> 00:22:45,522
So it's always a month in the rears for the actual billing itself.

434
00:22:45,642 --> 00:22:47,322
So we are continuing to monitor.

435
00:22:47,703 --> 00:22:54,525
And again, we capture an encumbrance of reserve for those expenses on the conservative side in these utilities to

436
00:22:55,187 --> 00:23:03,512
ensure that we have enough reserved for those high usage time slots, which is usually January, February, for the colder months.

437
00:23:03,892 --> 00:23:09,636
So we are on track with what we have done in the past prior years.

438
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:15,860
Again, it's an unknown what the remainder of February will bring and what March will bring.

439
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,342
So we will continue to monitor those areas.

440
00:23:20,297 --> 00:23:20,897
OK, thank you.

441
00:23:20,938 --> 00:23:23,940
Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file by Ms.

442
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,081
Mostone, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero?

443
00:23:26,522 --> 00:23:27,262
All those in favor?

444
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:27,682
Aye.

445
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:28,783
All those opposed?

446
00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:29,404
Motion passes.

447
00:23:29,424 --> 00:23:30,705
OK, thank you.

448
00:23:31,185 --> 00:23:34,187
Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business by Ms.

449
00:23:34,207 --> 00:23:35,388
Stone, seconded by Ms.

450
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:35,788
Kretz?

451
00:23:36,229 --> 00:23:36,769
All in favor?

452
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:36,849
Aye.

453
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:38,010
All opposed?

454
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:38,951
Motion granted.

455
00:23:39,591 --> 00:23:42,753
Report on Columbus School after-school tutoring program.

456
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:43,814
Ms.

457
00:23:43,854 --> 00:23:44,294
Caldwell.

458
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:46,296
Good evening.

459
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,023
The Columbus Elementary School began their after school math tutoring program on January 22nd this year.

460
00:23:53,764 --> 00:24:02,369
Currently, we have 23 grade three students, 29 grade four students, and 18 grade five students.

461
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:09,353
We have the grade level teachers, we have a special education staff member, Dr. K and Ms.

462
00:24:09,373 --> 00:24:17,138
Sherman Hudson are pitching in, as well as some honor students that are helping out, honor students from the high school that are helping out to make sure

463
00:24:17,588 --> 00:24:20,851
our kids can be the best that they can be in mathematics.

464
00:24:21,552 --> 00:24:35,604
Each child was given a pre-assessment on the very first day, and the assessments indicated weaknesses in two-digit multiplication, division and word problems, and struggling with rounding off and digital enhanced topic tests.

465
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:43,932
So we need to make sure that we do more work with our Chromebooks on a regular basis during the school day as well as after school.

466
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:45,203
Ms.

467
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:46,584
Kirsteen Patterson and Ms.

468
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:56,853
Tatiana Hall, who is from Easton Bus, went out of their way and worked wonders so that we had the bus when we needed it, so I'd like to thank both of them for all of their hard work.

469
00:24:57,983 --> 00:25:08,727
I was at the Columbus on the very first day that they had it on Tuesday, January 22nd, and I was surprised by how diligently the teachers and the students were working together.

470
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:20,912
At 345, when the tutoring program was over, there were lines of students who was going home with their parents for parent pickup, who was waiting for the bus, who was going for the after school program.

471
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,594
So it was all very orderly and very organized.

472
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:28,408
I would also like to thank Dr. Kaye and Ms.

473
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:39,913
Sherman-Hudson for their expertise in all of their organization, the teaching staff at the Columbus School for stepping up when I needed them to do that, the volunteers from Medford High School, Ms.

474
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:41,053
Patterson and Ms.

475
00:25:41,093 --> 00:25:43,875
Hall for working diligently on bus routes.

476
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:49,197
We all know that's not an easy thing to get done, but they did get it done in a timely way.

477
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:54,419
And of course, I want to thank you, the school committee, for giving us this opportunity

478
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:59,033
to help our children be the best that they can be and improve their scores.

479
00:25:59,053 --> 00:26:00,974
I'd be happy to answer any questions.

480
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,394
Mr. Benedetto.

481
00:26:04,115 --> 00:26:08,776
First of all, I want to thank you for all your hard work to get this up and running so quickly.

482
00:26:09,676 --> 00:26:10,877
Thank you.

483
00:26:10,897 --> 00:26:12,297
There was definitely a need.

484
00:26:12,757 --> 00:26:19,619
This program is exactly what we need for that school and to help us with our MCAS scores there.

485
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,160
I would like a report.

486
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,543
afterwards and see the growth from the students as well.

487
00:26:28,923 --> 00:26:39,530
And I wanted to know if anybody was tracking the last year's fifth grade students to who are now sixth grade students and what program or what we're doing for those students.

488
00:26:40,704 --> 00:26:42,604
that didn't do so well last year.

489
00:26:42,724 --> 00:26:44,265
Are we mentoring them?

490
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:48,285
What's happening for them as they take the sixth grade MCAS?

491
00:26:48,526 --> 00:26:50,526
You know, I'll look into that for you, Mr. Benedetto.

492
00:26:50,546 --> 00:26:55,827
Yeah, I just want to make sure those children also get the needs and the gaps, any gaps that are missing.

493
00:26:56,187 --> 00:26:58,307
We don't want to just do the next group.

494
00:26:58,347 --> 00:27:03,128
We want to make sure the group that had the issue gets addressed as well.

495
00:27:03,428 --> 00:27:05,929
So I'm requesting a report on the

496
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:12,408
current sixth graders who took fifth grade MCAS at the Columbus School.

497
00:27:13,888 --> 00:27:15,389
So there's a motion on the floor.

498
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:17,531
I am hoping one of my colleagues will support.

499
00:27:18,712 --> 00:27:20,513
Report on sixth graders.

500
00:27:20,873 --> 00:27:24,475
We had requested that during our committee meeting as well, so certainly.

501
00:27:25,616 --> 00:27:26,216
Seconded by Ms.

502
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:26,657
Vander Kloof.

503
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:29,158
Thank you.

504
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:31,220
And thank you, really, for all that work.

505
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,120
Mr. Ruggiero.

506
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:36,203
I wanted to know what materials are being used for the tutoring program.

507
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:41,329
So they are using the Envision materials, because those are the materials we use in math.

508
00:27:42,209 --> 00:27:47,171
We're trying to look at the online piece, because I don't think the kids get enough of that during the school day.

509
00:27:47,891 --> 00:27:57,515
And any additional materials, I know that our special education teacher has some materials that she uses with her students.

510
00:27:58,116 --> 00:28:01,717
Are you looking for more volunteers from the community, or do you think you have enough as of right now?

511
00:28:01,992 --> 00:28:05,715
Well, it's amazing to have these high school honor students step up.

512
00:28:05,755 --> 00:28:07,257
I think we have about six of them.

513
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:10,840
They're currently working in the third grade under the direction of the teacher.

514
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:14,743
But they're astute enough to take them to the computer labs and work with them there.

515
00:28:16,264 --> 00:28:20,748
I'll keep that in mind, if you don't mind, if we need some more people to help out.

516
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:21,249
Thank you.

517
00:28:23,711 --> 00:28:23,891
Ms.

518
00:28:23,931 --> 00:28:24,271
Mustone.

519
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,913
This is for you.

520
00:28:26,293 --> 00:28:27,374
What time does it go till?

521
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,482
So the students get out of school at 2.35.

522
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:37,707
From 2.35 to 3 o'clock, they go to the cafeteria and they have a snack because they need something right after school.

523
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,729
At 3 o'clock, the students go right up to their classrooms.

524
00:28:40,749 --> 00:28:41,690
They know where they're going.

525
00:28:42,891 --> 00:28:48,035
And it runs from 3 to 3.45, which is really just enough time for them.

526
00:28:48,355 --> 00:28:48,755
That's great.

527
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:49,296
Thank you.

528
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:50,116
You're welcome.

529
00:28:50,757 --> 00:28:51,357
Mr. Russo.

530
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:53,519
Hi, Diane.

531
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,122
Did the fifth graders last year

532
00:28:57,977 --> 00:29:04,239
had these less than stellar MCAS scores have particularly bad grades on the report cards?

533
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:07,060
I believe they probably did.

534
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,420
I'd have to check to make sure.

535
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:15,522
Could you like to make a motion to actually correlate those if there really was any?

536
00:29:17,643 --> 00:29:18,523
Yes, we can do that.

537
00:29:18,643 --> 00:29:18,903
Thank you.

538
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:21,530
Is there a second on Mr. Rousseau's motion?

539
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,791
Seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

540
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:27,414
Is there a motion to receive and place this report on file?

541
00:29:28,114 --> 00:29:28,875
All those in favor?

542
00:29:29,575 --> 00:29:30,296
All those opposed?

543
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:34,458
And on the motions by Mr. Benedetto and Mr. Rousseau, all those in favor?

544
00:29:34,478 --> 00:29:36,279
Aye.

545
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,280
All those opposed?

546
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,481
Motion passes.

547
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:39,882
Thank you.

548
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:44,184
The end of vote?

549
00:29:46,221 --> 00:30:00,749
So the question to follow up on Mr. Russo's question really is, is for the students who are in the sixth grade, are we looking at their math scores, the ones who came from the Columbus, are we looking at their math scores and seeing whether any of them need extra tutoring or?

550
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:01,869
That's Ms.

551
00:30:01,889 --> 00:30:02,650
DeVanadero's motion.

552
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,050
Oh, sorry.

553
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,730
OK.

554
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,511
Sorry about that.

555
00:30:04,851 --> 00:30:10,374
They're going to provide us with a review of what measures they have in place to help them.

556
00:30:10,674 --> 00:30:12,355
That motion has passed, so.

557
00:30:14,433 --> 00:30:20,254
All righty, report on correlation between free reduced lunch participants and access to the SAT.

558
00:30:21,934 --> 00:30:22,415
Good evening.

559
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,615
If you move your notebook, it's just pressing on that.

560
00:30:26,675 --> 00:30:27,936
There you go.

561
00:30:30,476 --> 00:30:40,518
At the last meeting, I was asked to investigate the correlation between free and reduced lunch participants and the SAT in the common application fee waiver.

562
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:48,351
The report that was submitted to the superintendent on February 9th is the collaboration of the guidance department and myself.

563
00:30:49,191 --> 00:30:54,415
And a couple of big takeaways I'd like to just point out to you and obviously answer any questions you may have.

564
00:30:55,236 --> 00:30:59,839
Presently, 30% of all seniors who've applied to college have received the fee waiver.

565
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:08,085
Out of our entire senior student body, 45% are eligible for the SAT fee waivers.

566
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:14,762
We do have only 219 of the 353 students who have presently applied for college.

567
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:26,548
So it is our expectation that once all these students do apply, we will find that to be full, that the full percent of the 45% of the students that would actually take advantage of the fee waiver.

568
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:31,270
We have also, I think it's worth noting that in October,

569
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:38,254
The guidance intern team came to me and asked me if they could work on a project.

570
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:41,277
Every year they have to work on a project and action plan for their program.

571
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:47,343
And their project this year actually was an investigation of this phenomenon, or this concern, I should say.

572
00:31:47,924 --> 00:31:50,586
So I spent many weeks with them setting this up.

573
00:31:50,626 --> 00:31:54,150
And I know that they worked with the food service program very closely.

574
00:31:54,607 --> 00:32:02,872
And from that, we also have a variety of bullets that's listed here of strategies that we have already put in place to address this concern.

575
00:32:04,133 --> 00:32:13,178
And going forward, we will continue to increase the communication with students and their families regarding this really great opportunity for students.

576
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:16,700
I'd be happy to answer any questions regarding this report.

577
00:32:17,661 --> 00:32:19,862
Thank you very much, Mr. Benedict-Ngo.

578
00:32:21,736 --> 00:32:22,577
Thank you for the report.

579
00:32:22,617 --> 00:32:29,482
I just wanted to make sure that all the students that were eligible were taking advantage of these things, and if there were any gaps, to meet those gaps.

580
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:34,005
I'm so grateful that you have those interns working on this project.

581
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:35,486
It seems timely to me.

582
00:32:35,986 --> 00:32:39,709
And I like your moving forward steps.

583
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:41,090
I always love to see that.

584
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:42,651
This is what we're doing now.

585
00:32:42,731 --> 00:32:44,313
This is what we're going to continue doing.

586
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:50,797
This is our next steps to make sure that we're reaching every family and every child that may need this help.

587
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:53,063
Thank you very much.

588
00:32:53,163 --> 00:32:53,704
Great report.

589
00:32:53,744 --> 00:32:57,548
And I would also say that to receive and place this report on file by Mr. Benedetto.

590
00:32:57,688 --> 00:32:58,329
Is there a second?

591
00:32:58,349 --> 00:32:58,890
Second.

592
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,232
Can I have a question?

593
00:33:01,252 --> 00:33:01,293
Ms.

594
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,394
Van de Kloot.

595
00:33:03,655 --> 00:33:12,385
Could you forward on to the committee members a copy of the flyer highlighting all the benefits students receive from applying for free or reduced lunch?

596
00:33:12,605 --> 00:33:13,246
Yes, I can do that.

597
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:14,504
OK, I think that's great.

598
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:16,785
I think it would be valuable for us to see.

599
00:33:16,885 --> 00:33:17,726
So thank you very much.

600
00:33:18,066 --> 00:33:22,287
I can also forward the action plan that was created by the intern team, if you like.

601
00:33:22,928 --> 00:33:24,408
It has other steps as well.

602
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:24,928
Great.

603
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:30,931
And one other thing I'd say is I think if we look at this data next year at the same time, hopefully we'll see an improvement in all the numbers.

604
00:33:32,431 --> 00:33:32,771
Very good.

605
00:33:33,632 --> 00:33:34,272
Thank you very much.

606
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,213
There's a motion on the floor to receive and place this report on file.

607
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:37,973
All those in favor?

608
00:33:38,374 --> 00:33:38,474
Aye.

609
00:33:38,754 --> 00:33:39,494
All those opposed?

610
00:33:39,514 --> 00:33:40,394
Motion passes.

611
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:46,849
Item seven, report on vaping information program.

612
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:51,351
Turn me off when the numbers change.

613
00:33:55,493 --> 00:34:01,795
Last Thursday evening, we had a really wonderful event take place at the Caron Theater at Medford High School.

614
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:13,500
It was really the culmination of many months of work amongst the administrative team and the nursing and the health service departments to really address a concern that I think

615
00:34:14,216 --> 00:34:17,037
is vexing the entire nation, and the state, of course.

616
00:34:18,298 --> 00:34:25,020
At this presentation, there were over 80 community members, including three of our own school community members, who were able to attend.

617
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:36,325
And it was a really wonderful show, presentation, question and answer section, which really kind of got at the heart of the vaping concerns that we have in our community.

618
00:34:39,002 --> 00:34:57,426
After the conclusion of this presentation, parents were invited to take part in a sort of a site visit, so to speak, an in-plane site view of a typical bedroom where students or children can hide items that may be concerning.

619
00:34:57,926 --> 00:35:03,387
And it was actually really interesting because there was a lot of conversation and discussion that took place in the bedroom as well about

620
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:14,657
not only the rights of parents and the need for parents to sort of, unfortunately, snoop from time to time and keep an eye on what their children are doing, but really specifics on how to do that.

621
00:35:16,258 --> 00:35:26,466
So the night went very well, and we sort of proposed it as a first step for Medford High School and the Medford community, because there was also people there from the elementary to middle schools.

622
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:39,377
And what I presented in the report tonight was not only sort of the success of that event, but also the steps that we are taking, because this, of course, is a multi-pronged endeavor for us.

623
00:35:40,117 --> 00:35:47,984
And just to kind of sum that up for you, so over the past nine months, we have spent a lot of time in our building really sort of

624
00:35:49,068 --> 00:35:57,951
Getting at the crux of this concern, we've held multiple faculty meetings where we've discussed the situation, presented it to the teachers to be on the lookout for.

625
00:35:58,852 --> 00:36:05,514
We've had community-based justice, CBJ, and building leadership team meetings on the same topic as well.

626
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:15,138
And the CBJ meeting is comprised of not only faculty from the building, but also from the police departments and from the district attorney's office.

627
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:28,264
We've redesigned our health classes where the health classes mid-year took on a different approach because of this ongoing concern that we identified where we're having discussions about this situation with students.

628
00:36:29,085 --> 00:36:29,505
We've also

629
00:36:30,817 --> 00:36:33,859
look to the students to be leaders in this topic.

630
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:46,450
We've conducted contests for PSAs and posters, which right now we're voting on to have awards for for students who present the best view from their perspective and also the concerns that they have.

631
00:36:48,863 --> 00:36:51,746
In the future, we're going to continue to address the situation.

632
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:53,808
This is not a one and done topic.

633
00:36:54,389 --> 00:37:03,279
We realize that, for instance, a year ago today, none of us, at least in our building, had any idea of what this issue would look like today.

634
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,403
So we're expecting to be a lot of changes in the next few months and years.

635
00:37:08,284 --> 00:37:09,045
What we'd like to do

636
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:21,385
in conjunction with the school committee is to continue the conversation on the community level by sharing information, presenting different speakers who can talk to that, as well as listening to parents and students.

637
00:37:22,166 --> 00:37:31,556
We're going to collect and utilize data that is at our fingertips regarding the number of students who get caught vaping and the consequences that they receive.

638
00:37:32,327 --> 00:37:43,870
And also, and this might be the most important piece, we need to convey to the community, especially our students, the seriousness of this situation, not only for their health, but for their well-being in the school.

639
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:49,332
If at this time I could take any questions regarding that at night, I'd be happy to.

640
00:37:52,193 --> 00:37:52,373
Ms.

641
00:37:52,393 --> 00:37:53,173
Vander Kloot.

642
00:37:53,193 --> 00:37:54,433
Dr. Perlow, I wanted to thank you.

643
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:59,435
This was a great presentation, and I was very happy I had the opportunity to attend.

644
00:38:01,962 --> 00:38:13,348
Apart from the information that was presented on vaping, I also want to mention that I thought it was fantastic that we had students available to act as interpreters that night for people in the audience.

645
00:38:13,428 --> 00:38:17,570
And that was just a great, great touch and something we should continue.

646
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:28,316
And even if they weren't utilized, I don't know how much they were utilized that particular night, but the fact that they were available for people who needed translation was terrific.

647
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:30,517
Thank you.

648
00:38:31,997 --> 00:38:32,717
Mr. Benedetto.

649
00:38:33,017 --> 00:38:33,798
Thank you, Maverick.

650
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:39,180
So there were two things that really stood out to me while we were getting information.

651
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,420
And it was pretty much from the audience members.

652
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:50,884
The first was a middle school parent who said that their child came home and told her that another student was vaping in our schools, in middle school.

653
00:38:51,104 --> 00:38:53,085
So that was alarming to me.

654
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:56,966
And I appreciated her candor in saying that there.

655
00:38:57,815 --> 00:39:09,583
The other thing that stood out tremendously is another student that spoke up during the meeting and asked for data to support what we were saying to her because she wasn't just going to believe that we thought it was bad for her.

656
00:39:09,943 --> 00:39:13,025
She wanted data and backup to support that.

657
00:39:13,245 --> 00:39:23,331
And that's, we have bright children and we need to be prepared with actual facts and figures if we're going to tell them they shouldn't or shouldn't do with something.

658
00:39:23,391 --> 00:39:24,292
So I was impressed.

659
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:25,912
at that as well.

660
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:37,876
What I'd like to see, and I talked to you a little bit about this at the end of the evening, is really a hard line, a very hard line that we don't allow cigarette smoking in our schools or anywhere near them.

661
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:40,097
We're not going to allow vaping either.

662
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:41,958
We're going to have it in our handbooks.

663
00:39:42,218 --> 00:39:46,699
They're going to be at our submaster, I don't know if they're still submaster nights, our welcoming nights.

664
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,400
Our parents should know our routine.

665
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,501
It should be initialed.

666
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:52,281
It should be

667
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:59,187
For a student that is vaping, we should show everybody, see, we're not doing this in MedFed.

668
00:39:59,468 --> 00:40:02,711
There are so many health things.

669
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,694
So vaping, you think you're just sucking in water.

670
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:06,154
It's not.

671
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:07,035
It's all chemicals.

672
00:40:07,075 --> 00:40:09,357
And those chemicals are going into our children's lungs.

673
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:14,342
And they think that this is a better choice than smoking, which is even more alarming.

674
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:16,980
Because we don't know what it's doing in those lungs.

675
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,462
Because there could be 40 different chemicals going into your children's lungs.

676
00:40:20,903 --> 00:40:21,603
It's huge.

677
00:40:21,723 --> 00:40:22,804
It's very important.

678
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:24,406
And everybody's cool doing it.

679
00:40:24,806 --> 00:40:28,108
And, you know, the way they hide it and the way they can use it.

680
00:40:28,208 --> 00:40:30,871
And teachers, it can be happening right in front of them.

681
00:40:31,151 --> 00:40:33,893
And teachers are supposed to be teaching, you know.

682
00:40:34,994 --> 00:40:37,996
You can't expect this from everyone.

683
00:40:38,036 --> 00:40:41,239
So it has to come from the top, the sides, and the bottom up.

684
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:43,140
It has to be a whole community effort.

685
00:40:43,453 --> 00:40:43,853
to do this.

686
00:40:43,913 --> 00:40:46,935
I was happy to see Penny from Team Medfit, the whole group there.

687
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:48,937
It was a great program.

688
00:40:49,177 --> 00:40:51,298
I wish it had been better attended.

689
00:40:51,618 --> 00:40:59,984
But if they're not coming to us, then we're going to go every athletic meeting that someone goes to, it should be presented and every coach should be trained on it.

690
00:41:01,005 --> 00:41:06,048
I just think overall, it's going to be a bigger, bigger picture than we ever anticipated.

691
00:41:06,848 --> 00:41:12,232
I want to thank you for bringing this up so quickly and seeing the need for it.

692
00:41:12,723 --> 00:41:17,787
And your team was excellent at everything, and Tony Vento as well.

693
00:41:19,388 --> 00:41:22,731
So even our school nurses were present at this.

694
00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:23,671
This is huge.

695
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:27,434
This is huge for our children's future health and well-being.

696
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,395
And you were very proactive.

697
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:30,196
Thank you.

698
00:41:30,396 --> 00:41:32,818
And I would say that it is a real medical concern.

699
00:41:33,338 --> 00:41:36,381
And one of the big issues for us is that it's highly addictive.

700
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:42,045
So we're looking at adolescents who are getting into an addiction that is

701
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:45,317
as we all know, is incredibly difficult to break.

702
00:41:45,738 --> 00:41:53,342
And I think that requires the mental health and the health services department to work with us, because it's not something we just can punish away.

703
00:41:53,402 --> 00:41:57,244
We have to sort of work as really a societal problem presently.

704
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,464
Very good.

705
00:41:58,865 --> 00:41:59,045
Ms.

706
00:41:59,065 --> 00:41:59,405
Kratz.

707
00:42:00,045 --> 00:42:00,185
Yep.

708
00:42:00,505 --> 00:42:00,946
Thank you.

709
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:05,088
Yep, it was a great presentation, and I learned a lot.

710
00:42:05,628 --> 00:42:08,910
I thought it was so interesting when Mr. Toomey was giving his presentation

711
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:13,607
He was actually holding a device, a vaping device, and you couldn't tell.

712
00:42:14,328 --> 00:42:22,673
They're so discreet, so they come in just different shapes and sizes, and it looks like a pen, and it was really incredible.

713
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:28,016
And I think it was Maureen who described what the vape was like.

714
00:42:28,356 --> 00:42:37,922
So when you're cooking a chicken and there's residue that goes all over your stove, how it's like that slimy film, that's what it's doing to the insides of your lungs.

715
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:47,766
So that's what, I just couldn't get that out of my head, that film that goes on your stove and just breathing that vape in and it's just going inside your lungs.

716
00:42:48,226 --> 00:43:02,498
And then going into the room, the bedroom, in plain sight, some of the places that you could hide the vape and the juice and all the components were in plain sight.

717
00:43:02,518 --> 00:43:05,781
It was like a Pringles jar that opened from the bottom.

718
00:43:06,955 --> 00:43:10,816
You know, it was very, it was, it was really, I learned a lot.

719
00:43:10,856 --> 00:43:14,896
It was really, it was a great presentation and thank you everyone.

720
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:16,517
It was a great job by all.

721
00:43:16,777 --> 00:43:17,197
Thank you.

722
00:43:17,637 --> 00:43:17,937
Thank you.

723
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:18,437
Thank you.

724
00:43:18,497 --> 00:43:21,117
Is there a motion to receive this report and place it on file by Ms.

725
00:43:21,157 --> 00:43:23,178
Mostone, seconded by Mr. Ruggiero.

726
00:43:23,218 --> 00:43:23,938
All those in favor?

727
00:43:24,338 --> 00:43:24,458
Aye.

728
00:43:24,598 --> 00:43:25,218
All those opposed?

729
00:43:25,238 --> 00:43:26,678
Thank you very much, Dr. Farrello.

730
00:43:26,718 --> 00:43:29,019
If I could say one more thing as well, put a little plug in.

731
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:34,700
This week at the high school, we're also addressing another concern with us is technology in society.

732
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,220
We have been, um,

733
00:43:37,255 --> 00:43:48,102
showing to the students a movie called Screenagers, which really is about this addictive, another addictive problem in society is phone use and technology use.

734
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:54,226
And we are also having a free of charge presentation for the community Thursday evening.

735
00:43:54,246 --> 00:43:58,810
This is due to the PTO who paid for the services and the licensure.

736
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,491
Hopefully you all also can come as well.

737
00:44:01,511 --> 00:44:03,112
It's 6.30 Thursday night.

738
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:04,213
Very good.

739
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:04,433
Thank you.

740
00:44:04,453 --> 00:44:04,894
Thank you.

741
00:44:05,014 --> 00:44:05,374
You're welcome.

742
00:44:07,117 --> 00:44:10,658
Next up is the report on focus groups scheduled for our superintendent search.

743
00:44:10,718 --> 00:44:13,838
The preliminary focus groups will be held during the week of February 12, 2018.

744
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:17,779
The schedule is as follows.

745
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:21,300
On February 13, school administration from 12 to 2 p.m.

746
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,601
in CCSR, which is at Medford High School in the library.

747
00:44:25,261 --> 00:44:28,562
February 13, teachers, 2.30 to 4.30 p.m.

748
00:44:28,722 --> 00:44:30,562
in that same room at Medford High School.

749
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:38,016
And February 15th, the general public, which the superintendent announced would be held in the, in the council chambers.

750
00:44:39,257 --> 00:44:43,000
Additional focus groups will be arranged during the week of February 26 as well.

751
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:50,026
So keep, stay tuned to everybody's motion to receive this report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo.

752
00:44:50,046 --> 00:44:50,767
All those in favor?

753
00:44:51,187 --> 00:44:51,287
Aye.

754
00:44:51,548 --> 00:44:52,128
All those opposed?

755
00:44:52,168 --> 00:44:52,909
Motion passes.

756
00:44:54,036 --> 00:44:58,921
If we could move suspension to move negotiations and legal matters to the end of the agenda.

757
00:44:59,882 --> 00:45:01,363
Moved by Mr. Ruggiero, seconded by Ms.

758
00:45:01,383 --> 00:45:01,784
Leanderclude.

759
00:45:01,844 --> 00:45:02,505
All those in favor?

760
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:02,605
Aye.

761
00:45:03,425 --> 00:45:04,046
All those opposed?

762
00:45:04,086 --> 00:45:04,947
Motion passes.

763
00:45:05,007 --> 00:45:05,508
New business.

764
00:45:05,548 --> 00:45:06,729
School committee resolution.

765
00:45:07,289 --> 00:45:11,854
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Kathleen McAdam.

766
00:45:12,354 --> 00:45:12,535
Ms.

767
00:45:12,555 --> 00:45:15,598
McAdam was the sister of retired high school teacher John McAdam.

768
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:22,008
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Yehud Bouali.

769
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:27,350
Yehud was an international student in the ELL class at the Brooks Elementary School.

770
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,491
If we could all please rise for a moment of silence, please.

771
00:45:38,293 --> 00:45:39,694
Thank you.

772
00:45:43,495 --> 00:45:44,095
Mr. Benedetto.

773
00:45:45,302 --> 00:45:49,603
I just wanted to say that the McAdams family were neighbors of mine.

774
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:53,344
So Mr. McAdams passed two weeks prior to his daughter.

775
00:45:53,664 --> 00:45:55,765
So it's a big loss for our neighborhood.

776
00:45:55,785 --> 00:46:00,226
We've lost four people since Christmas in our neighborhood.

777
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:05,548
And they were a wonderful family in our neighborhood for many, many years.

778
00:46:05,788 --> 00:46:09,609
And they're always wonderful, wonderful people.

779
00:46:09,649 --> 00:46:10,610
And they'll be sorely missed.

780
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:12,150
Thank you.

781
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:18,265
In old business, I don't know if we need to go over it, but the field trip form, do we need to approve that?

782
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:25,009
There are two or three minor changes, and I just don't want to miss it if they need to be approved.

783
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:25,489
I don't know.

784
00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:28,571
If it's approved, it's subject to them incorporating the changes into the document.

785
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:29,031
OK.

786
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:29,351
Just Ms.

787
00:46:29,371 --> 00:46:30,372
Vandervloot.

788
00:46:30,392 --> 00:46:35,575
I hate to say this, but there's a spelling mistake on it.

789
00:46:35,595 --> 00:46:35,775
OK.

790
00:46:35,795 --> 00:46:37,596
Well, I'm glad you told me today, not tomorrow.

791
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:41,538
So if you go down to the last line where it says notification,

792
00:46:41,908 --> 00:46:43,449
The word signatures is spelled wrong.

793
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:44,149
OK.

794
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:44,870
Take care of it.

795
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:48,352
Then I'll post it tomorrow to the website, right?

796
00:46:48,832 --> 00:46:48,972
Yep.

797
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:54,316
And have training, two hour training on this form.

798
00:46:54,336 --> 00:46:56,317
We've personally spent how many hours?

799
00:46:57,238 --> 00:46:57,878
All right.

800
00:46:57,958 --> 00:46:59,339
Negotiation and legal matters.

801
00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:02,621
There's a matter that we need to discuss in executive session.

802
00:47:02,681 --> 00:47:05,603
Is there a motion on the floor to go into executive session by Mr. Giro?

803
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:07,384
Seconded by Mr. Stone.

804
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:08,665
Roll call vote, please.

805
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:18,959
Yes.

806
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,882
Yes, 70 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

807
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:22,643
Motion passes.

808
00:47:22,683 --> 00:47:26,767
We will not be coming out to the floor after the following executive session.

809
00:47:26,807 --> 00:47:27,808
We'll adjourn from the meeting.
