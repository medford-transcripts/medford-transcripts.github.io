    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=496.759s">Roll</a>  call. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=499.567s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=500.528s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=501.168s">Member</a>  Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=502.189s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=502.95s">Member</a>  McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=504.751s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=505.431s">Member</a>  Mustone? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=506.652s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=507.633s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=509.574s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=510.415s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=511.456s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=513.317s">Mayor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=514.358s">Yes,</a>  I'm in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=516.88s">If</a>  I could ask a question about those minutes, just because I wasn't able to attend, I know there's a lot of recommendations about different <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=524.626s">holidays,</a>  are we leaving that up to the superintendent to do her due diligence and try to, are you gonna have another meeting to discuss additional holidays? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=534.573s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=535.334s">Yeah,</a>  we have a list that we aren't really settled on that, whether it's an observance list or whatever way we're gonna end up calling it, which will list all of the dates that will be published each year. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=546.581s">And</a>  there'll be a separate column that instructs the superintendent how to interpret that particular holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=553.534s">whether</a>  it has to be a day off from school or whether it should be, you know, the teachers and special events should not be scheduled on those dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=564.66s">So</a>  it sort of lays all that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=566.421s">And</a>  then this list can be used by the superintendent each November to go through the list, look up and, you know, a lot of these are, a lot of these religious holidays are based on a lunar calendar or other calendars. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=579.769s">And</a>  so, you know, they're not like, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=582.188s">you</a>  know, not like Thanksgiving, where there's a third Thursday of November, they change quite dramatically through the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=589.652s">So</a>  there will be an effort, but it will be an effort of going through the entire list, looking for the ones where we've said no school, figuring out what the date is, and just using that as an input to the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=605.42s">But</a>  that is not quite complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=607.721s">So</a>  that will be the next thing that comes back to the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=613.035s">Okay,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=614.076s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=617.998s">Motion</a>  to approve the minutes, maybe?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=619.499s">Motion</a>  to approve the minutes by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Van der Kloot.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=625.142s">Roll</a>  call, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=626.302s">Mayor,</a>  could I, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=628.223s">Yes,</a>  Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=629.984s">I</a>  just also wanted to, I don't have the recording for this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=636.448s">There</a>  is on page two in the bottom, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=644.143s">parts</a>  of the minutes, it says, Paul Rousseau, there's a sentence in here that I don't believe that's what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=650.586s">And</a>  if I did say it, I certainly didn't mean it the way it's written. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=653.207s">So</a>  I'd like to just amend that to be whatever was actually in the recording. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=656.929s">So</a>  right now it says, I believe in separation of church and state, but have come a long way towards respecting the faith of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=665.033s">I</a>  didn't have to go anywhere to respect the face of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=669.835s">I've</a>  come a long way to value <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=672.985s">recognizing</a>  each of these holidays and that that's an educational opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=678.85s">But</a>  this sort of sounds like I came from not respecting the faiths of the community to finally respecting them and that is definitely not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=686.415s">So</a>  wherever that recording is, if somebody could update the minutes to what I actually said, I would appreciate that.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=694.382s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=697.644s">So</a>  roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=700.158s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=700.498s">Member</a>  Graham? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=701.699s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=702.379s">Member</a>  Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=703.44s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=704.12s">Member</a>  McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=705.741s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=706.402s">Member</a>  Mustone? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=707.302s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=708.103s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=709.544s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=710.224s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=710.965s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=711.745s">Mayor?</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=712.626s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=712.906s">Seven</a>  in the affirmative, zero in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=714.967s">Minutes</a>  are approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=716.528s">We</a>  have Building and Grounds Subcommittee, Member Kreatz, approval of the minutes from 11-5-2020.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=724.005s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=724.745s">So</a>  the building and grants subcommittee had a meeting via zoom on November 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=730.447s">Subcommittee</a>  members, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=731.608s">Van</a>  der Kloot and Mr. Russo were present. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=733.828s">Also</a>  in attendance were Mr. Cles Anderson, parent architect community board development member, Fiona Maxwell, procurement city of Medford, Alicia Hunt, parent and director of energy and environment, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=747.313s">and</a>  Carolyn Montello Parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=749.357s">Also</a>  present were Chad Fallon, Paul DeLeva, John McLaughlin, Peter Cushing, and Dr. Edouard Maurice. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=757.401s">First</a>  we discuss the upcoming 2021 subcommittee dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=759.624s">So</a>  our March 3rd, 2021, 5 to 6.30 and June 2nd, 2021 is not good because of graduation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=763.188s">So</a>  the new date is May 26th, 2021 at 5 to 6.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=777.725s">After</a>  we discussed the career technical updates from Mr. Fallon, he mentioned that the only positive with the students not being in schools has been the ability to do updates at the Method Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=790.178s">Some</a>  of the completed projects are the robotics and engineering, classroom lab and engineering shop, paint and labor were provided by painters union DC35. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=799.384s">LED</a>  lighting was installed in many areas, thanks to Alicia Hunt for her help with that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=805.668s">Programming</a>  and web development moved into a new space with 25 workstations, new carpet squares, paint and new computers. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=813.333s">Construction</a>  technology lab, desks were built by the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=817.53s">The</a>  current projects are cosmetology. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=820.151s">A</a>  private donor gave $100,000 to put toward this program, provided for painting, electrical sinks, marble install of workstations, replacement windows, chemical mixing room, eyewash stations, and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=835.779s">And</a>  they're on track to finishing in the next couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=838.821s">And</a>  it's going to have a really nice name. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=840.302s">It's</a>  going to be named the Priscilla Hoff Salon. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=843.243s">The</a>  automotive and technology resurface the paint shop floor at no cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=848.43s">It</a>  was done by apprentices from painters union, the students assisted with the, with the design plans, and they designed a racing flag, like a racing flag design on the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=859.606s">The</a>  painting was an epoxy process. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=861.788s">Sherman</a>  Williams and Union shared the cost of the paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=865.471s">Originally,</a>  Mr. Fallon got a quote of $65,000 and $99,000, but it was provided free of charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=871.797s">This</a>  was a once-in-a-lifetime project. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=874.486s">I</a>  just want to extend my thanks, and we did at the meeting to Mr. Fallon, the students, vocational teachers, apprentices from the Painters Union, Sherman Williams, and the Hoff family for all the work that's being done to continue to improve the Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=889.6s">Also,</a>  special thanks to Alicia Hunt for the support of her schools in finding ways to get energy efficient resources to all of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=896.547s">We</a>  have so many great partnerships. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=898.869s">I</a>  provided with the group with an update about the brick fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=902.013s">It's</a>  currently on hold. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=904.056s">And</a>  we'll, you know, update the, you know, the committee with any updates that we have in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=908.762s">Then</a>  we moved on to the discussion about the member high school front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=914.85s">and</a>  Mr. Cless Anderson, parent of high school and middle school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=918.852s">He's</a>  an architect and community development board member, shared a design of Meveritt High School front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=925.135s">Mr.</a>  Andreessen met at the site earlier this summer with my fellow subcommittee members and a couple of other people. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=931.878s">After</a>  the BRIC fundraiser idea, he planned a design of what the front entrance would maybe visualize what it could look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=940.862s">He</a>  volunteered to put together an architectural design. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=943.723s">He</a>  went to the high school front entrance with five high school students who helped measure the design in the entrance and they counted the bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=951.684s">The</a>  current ramp doesn't seem compliant to the code. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=954.665s">Kless</a>  offered a plan to integrate a design into the brick work. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=958.566s">The</a>  first idea was a map of Medford in blue bricks with personal messages that can be stamped on the bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=964.267s">You</a>  could have special bricks with landmarks in the town. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=966.987s">The</a>  second idea was to put the Medford logo into the bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=970.288s">We</a>  would need to think about whether it was recognizable by the eye. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=974.032s">I'm</a>  sorry, eye level or like, you know, from a distance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=978.096s">The</a>  students offered an idea of a wave or scientific image. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=982.1s">It</a>  showed a hue wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=983.982s">Another</a>  idea of a simple repetitive pattern, smaller quantity specialized bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=988.446s">There</a>  were a lot of options on how we can deploy this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=992.49s">Mr.</a>  Russo and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=993.471s">Van</a>  der Kloot expressed safety concerns with the current ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=996.513s">Also</a>  discussed there were concerns about the sustainability in the white bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1000.455s">Will</a>  they get dirty? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1001.756s">Kless</a>  suggests using all new bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1004.757s">So</a>  we asked John, you know, if he could get back to us with the cost of what it would cost to replace all the bricks just to get an estimate on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1014.46s">And</a>  then John also asked Mr. Klaus Anderson if he could do an RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1019.983s">And</a>  we'll consider, you know, the fundraiser after the project or maybe when we get the estimates and then maybe can meet again and talk about the project again. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1029.557s">Also</a>  on the call was Fiona Maxwell from the Procurement Department in Medford City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1034.281s">She</a>  was there to help answer questions and provide us with some information. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1038.124s">She</a>  mentioned there were a lot of rules we need to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1040.866s">It</a>  sounds like we have a few different projects going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1043.528s">Project</a>  A is a capital project with new ramp, walls, and bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1047.832s">Project</a>  B, whether the bricks can be taken out and also an ADA issue, an ADA ramp that needs to be redone. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1055.918s">The</a>  design work is exempt from limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1058.48s">If</a>  it's over a certain $1 amount, it would need to be sealed for a bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1062.042s">For</a>  example, ramp and signage are compliant of 39M. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1066.843s">Purchasing</a>  bricks and reselling them make a deliverable good. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1070.105s">Architect</a>  services make for a bigger project. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1072.886s">There</a>  were a lot of components under one umbrella that we were all talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1077.328s">And</a>  I really appreciated Fiona being on the call to <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1080.289s">know,</a>  to guide us and help answer some questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1082.991s">And</a>  she's going to reach out to john, you know, over the next couple of weeks, regarding some of the things we asked for, you know, for him to look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1091.218s">Miss</a>  Carolyn Montello, who's a parent, also volunteered at the site originally this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1096.142s">And</a>  she's shown a great interest into helping us with this brick project in the design of the front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1101.726s">She</a>  noted the original intent was to sell the bricks for scholarships, not to cover the whole cost of the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1106.889s">So</a>  she reminded us of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1108.951s">And</a>  also like what we all talked about was that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1112.373s">I</a>  think people will get more excited when we maybe have some sort of a renovated design that we can show people and then maybe do the fundraising of the bricks once we have that design and it will be renovating the school and scholarship program. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1127.38s">So</a>  what we all came to the conclusion is that the project has evolved into kind of a capital project now, a little bit more or a mix of a capital project and then the fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1141.066s">So,</a>  and Dr. Maurice also, she expressed that this may need to be done in phases staggered over time with the goal of getting the change of a front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1150.934s">And</a>  that's what our goal will be is getting the change of the front entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1153.996s">And</a>  the first step is getting a cost estimate to determine how to move forward from there. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1159.541s">So</a>  we did ask John to get some numbers on the different phases, especially those not ADA compliant or safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1167.627s">and</a>  I just want to thank John McLaughlin, Klaus Andresen, Caroline Montello. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1174.636s">I'm</a>  sorry, I put Bill McLaughlin in the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1176.899s">It</a>  should be Bill Carr, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1179.863s">Susie,</a>  would you be able to update that? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1181.685s">I'm</a>  sorry, I just noticed it right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1183.828s">I</a>  was getting names mixed up, should say Bill Carr. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1186.811s">And</a>  the students for their volunteering and assisting with design. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1191.294s">I</a>  mean, I thought that was so wonderful that the students went out and they enjoyed what Mr. Andres has said was they enjoyed coming up with designs and counting the bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1201.503s">And</a>  it was just a wonderful to hear that report. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1204.766s">And</a>  we are very fortunate to have everybody helping us with these future plans and maybe future architects. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1211.505s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1212.526s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1213.006s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1213.846s">Yeah,</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1214.627s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1215.067s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1215.487s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1216.108s">Did</a>  you have more. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1217.288s">Did</a>  you just had a couple more. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1219.33s">There</a>  was. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1220.75s">It</a>  was a really involved meeting, and I couldn't really cut out a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1226.634s">So</a>  I'll just run through. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1227.574s">I</a>  just have them bulleted right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1229.956s">So</a>  john McLaughlin provided updates with see building project. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1234.718s">He's</a>  waiting for the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1236.259s">He's</a>  waiting for tiles, samples. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1239.181s">He's</a>  looking at colors to look the same as the science lab bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1244.265s">The</a>  treads on the stairs are done. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1246.226s">I</a>  don't know if you remember that we went on that walkthrough and the treads are done. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1250.169s">The</a>  emergency generator is going to cost over $200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1252.71s">There's</a>  only $160,000 left in free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1257.914s">Between</a>  the bathroom project and the generator, we are going to be running into money problems with both of those projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1264.559s">The</a>  Andrews school roof finished this summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1267.181s">The</a>  solar project will finish next summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1269.503s">Speed</a>  signs are on order. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1271.184s">The</a>  locations are not set in stone, but they're on order. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1273.927s">Playground</a>  resurfacing, money from the grant CPA, the Columbus and the Brooks are resurfaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1280.352s">All</a>  the broken equipment was replaced before resurfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1283.535s">John</a>  is going to get some pictures as soon as he can and share them at an upcoming meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1287.498s">The</a>  radio project system being updated district wide, we have provided new radios to the principal offices and all would be linked to the police in the fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1297.005s">Dr.</a>  Cushing provided an update on the McGlynn complex. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1300.506s">They</a>  have $40,000 for design at McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1304.047s">They</a>  were reaching out to the city side to make sure that we have procurement done for the soft surface of the playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1309.328s">The</a>  McGlynn was more prone to flooding, and also they're looking for something for students of all abilities and paths in life to give a better access to the playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1319.601s">And</a>  Alicia Height informed us that she is looking at the solar battery storage at the McGlynn School. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1324.964s">The</a>  goal is to have the noisy work done over the spring break. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1328.307s">Dr.</a>  Cushing asked if we could do this at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1330.968s">And</a>  Alicia Hunt replied, if we did the roof over first, we could do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1335.351s">And</a>  then he asked if we could do a canopy instead. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1338.093s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1338.593s">Hunt</a>  replied that the upfront costs are higher for the canopy and the battery grant is a funded grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1344.757s">and</a>  then the meeting adjourned and you know it was a really really great meeting and I really appreciate everybody and all the attendance and thank you.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1351.345s">Thank</a>  you Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1357.752s">Member</a>  McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1359.818s">Thank</a>  you, Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1360.999s">That</a>  sounds like it was a really involved meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1362.72s">It</a>  was. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1364.281s">A</a>  lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1364.801s">I</a>  had a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1368.243s">Specifically,</a>  the concerns around the ADA compliance in the ramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1373.126s">I</a>  know that you said Member Van der Kloot and Member Ruseau were also concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1377.108s">I'm</a>  wondering if you know or if John McLaughlin can share with us what the safety concerns are for the ADA compliance with the ramp.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1392.397s">I</a>  don't believe john mclaughlin I reached out to john yesterday to ask if he was going to be on the call, he is not going to be on the call this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1400.387s">So</a>  if you want, I mean we could put some questions together in an email.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1407.969s">Yeah,</a>  it's just not accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1409.79s">Oh,</a>  Mr. Member van der Koek, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1411.531s">Yes,</a>  so the ramp, as I understand it, was put in to assist loading and unloading, particularly of the musical instruments and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1421.996s">And</a>  it was never meant to be ADA accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1425.477s">If</a>  you recall, there is an ADA accessible ramp at the front of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1430.86s">My</a>  safety concerns, though, is that because it is there, that it opens us up to concern automatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1440.646s">As</a>  you think about it, there is no railing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1443.376s">When</a>  I come out of the building at night from a concert, I have been concerned on many an occasion that someone could make a misstep in the lowered light, even though we've improved lighting there, but it'd be highly possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1458.92s">And</a>  that's for anybody, not only somebody who might also use the ramp, which might have some concerns, maybe wheelchair, whatever, it's clearly too steep for, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1473.043s">safe</a>  wheelchair. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1473.943s">So,</a>  but that is not the designated ADA ramp, but it exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1481.065s">And</a>  again, it was put in for, you know, all of a sudden it appeared and there was a reason for its appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1487.586s">But</a>  for me personally, from the time it's gone in, I've been concerned about it.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1495.402s">Can</a>  you orient me, member Van der Kloot, as to where? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1499.003s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1499.343s">You're</a>  at the front of the building, and you're looking at the doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1502.543s">And</a>  the ramp is, part of it is stairs, but the ramp is right there on the left.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1510.005s">Oh,</a>  going into the theater doors?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1512.265s">No,</a>  no, it's outside.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1513.706s">Yes,</a>  outside.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1516.426s">Outside.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1517.446s">So</a>  you've probably been up and down it 1,000 times, Melanie.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1521.317s">I'm</a>  sure I probably have.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1524.059s">This</a>  is just a steep, too steep ramp, and then the stairs are to the right.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1528.342s">Okay,</a>  but it does not, but there is obviously the other ramp, which is fine and is totally ADA compliant, and it's not an accessibility issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1538.669s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1540.27s">For</a>  me, it's not so much an accessibility issue as my concern about what if someone makes a misstep off the side.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1548.612s">Right,</a>  it's a safety issue and maybe more than an accessibility issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1552.282s">Okay,</a>  thank you for that clarification.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1555.189s">And</a>  then it's not accessible.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1557.198s">It's</a>  not ADA accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1559.239s">I</a>  mean, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1560.22s">It's</a>  a ramp that's not ADA accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1561.961s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1562.542s">And</a>  I'm sure that's probably because of the slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1565.704s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1566.004s">And</a>  the grade of it, but I'm not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1567.585s">I</a>  mean, I'm not an expert, but I assume. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1570.087s">So</a>  I'm, yeah, I would assume John is going to have to get somebody in there to, to think about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1575.971s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1576.151s">And</a>  I, I would just say that obviously if there's prioritizing, it sounds like you said, Kathy, they're going to prioritize anything in that legal realm first. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1583.897s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1584.717s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1587.82s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1588.16s">And</a>  then the other question I had is regarding the resurfacing on the playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1593.506s">I</a>  know that the McGlynn School resurfacing, not just resurfacing, but playground as a whole was going to be, as you said, really focused on making an inclusive experience, an inclusive playground for <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1608.182s">students</a>  of all abilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1609.483s">And</a>  I'm wondering, again, maybe this is a question for John or whoever was at the meeting related to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1615.184s">Is</a>  there an expert? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1616.945s">And</a>  maybe it applies to the same, to the first question as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1620.946s">Is</a>  there an expert in the, you know, field, in the disability field that is advising us on these things?</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1629.589s">Is</a>  Mr. Cushing on the call, Dr. Cushing? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1631.71s">Because</a>  he might, he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1634.351s">Yeah,</a>  he has his hand raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1635.952s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1636.712s">I</a>  am.</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1638.009s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1639.009s">Yes,</a>  do you know the answer to that?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1641.531s">So</a>  we have been awarded $40,000 from the Community Preservation Fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1646.993s">And</a>  as the COVID shutdown happened, one of the things that we were doing was we were seeking initial ideas from various companies, architectural firms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1658.998s">We</a>  now have to formally put it out to bid, given what we're looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1664.801s">And</a>  we're really looking for someone like you said, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1667.51s">an</a>  expert in the field, someone to guide the process to make sure that this is not just a regular playground, that it is an accessible playground for all children of all abilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1680.035s">And</a>  just a quick refresh is that the soft surface at McGlynn is enormous. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1689.218s">It</a>  would be over half a million dollars to replace Justin of itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1692.78s">It's</a>  prone to flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1694.318s">and</a>  the elements are definitely approaching 20 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1699.16s">So</a>  now's the time given the size of it, the central location to everybody in the city, that is the time and the opportunity to really take a solid look at a true investment into this playground. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1710.745s">So</a>  we are right now working through the finance office to make sure that we have all of our appropriate things for procurement done so that we're <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1722.99s">very</a>  correct in that.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1725.813s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1726.193s">And</a>  I know the mass office on disability who we've had come and speak in the past, I'm sure you know is available to offer expertise as well and I'll send that contact info to you too and I do realize that there were some meetings around. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1741.225s">you</a>  know, with some of the recreation and Boston Recreation and other folks who have done this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1748.291s">I</a>  just want to make sure that they continue to be included in the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1752.755s">So</a>  what's best way to handle that, Peter? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1755.798s">Dr.</a>  Cushion, just email you to follow up.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1758.94s">You</a>  can email it a follow up or, you know, in the in the next week or so, once we are able to put this out to bid, we're going to be forming a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1769.015s">of</a>  interested parents, community members, students, to really be a part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1773.357s">The</a>  CCSR wants to help out with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1776.318s">We</a>  were able to meet last fall, last fall, my God, blurring together, last spring before everything just shut down and abruptly ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1785.201s">And</a>  so we really wanna continue those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1787.702s">We</a>  wanna have a really good understanding and make sure that we maximize this money in having those community conversations and coming up with a well thought out plan.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1796.631s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1797.092s">And</a>  I would really encourage someone reaching out to the chairs of the Medford CPAC and to the parents of children with disabilities in the school so that they're definitely part of that committee, that there are members that are part of that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1809.585s">So</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1810.846s">Appreciate</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1822.081s">On</a>  the playgrounds, we passed a resolution at our March 9th meeting to establish this playground advisory committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1831.644s">And</a>  the goal of that committee was not only to be part of the process around the McGlynn Playground Design Study, but also to look at all of our playgrounds for the ways in which we may have had small opportunities to make the playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1850.628s">you</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1851.818s">more</a>  playful and accessible and inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1854.439s">And</a>  I was surprised to see the playgrounds all dug up when I was by one of the elementary schools the other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1861.461s">So</a>  I feel like the intent and spirit of that resolution was that that committee would be formed before any work got done. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1869.464s">So</a>  we have passed that gate now, but I would ask that that committee be formed before an RFP goes out to bid, because if we don't have good requirements in the RFP bid, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1881.195s">in</a>  terms of what our vision of making sure that the design firms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1886.978s">are</a>  including the right folks, know how to engage the community, et cetera, then we will have missed yet another gate where we could have had community input. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1897.344s">We</a>  had a really great meeting in early March with a number of people who were interested in this discussion, who had really wonderful and particular ideas about how to do this at all of our playgrounds, not necessarily just at the McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1911.473s">And</a>  I know, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1914.054s">Shortly</a>  after that, things changed radically. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1916.576s">We</a>  actually on our April 6 meeting talked about moving the date out a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1921.401s">And</a>  so we're obviously well past that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1923.703s">But</a>  I would ask that before an RFP go out, we go back to the resolution that was passed on March 9 and make sure that that committee is formed so that they can be part of the review of what that RFP is asking for and seeking. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1939.043s">Um,</a>  because we have already missed some opportunities in my opinion to have potentially, um, resurface those playgrounds with, um, with opportunities potentially that we now don't have because we have resurfaced those playgrounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1954.916s">So,</a>  um, I would ask that we sort of cycle back to that original intent and make sure that we engage the community before we move forward further. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1970.768s">And</a>  then I did have another question about the minutes of this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1975.232s">I</a>  feel a little bit lost because I feel like the discussion about the facade of the high school is sort of rolling full steam ahead when we put on hold the vision committee and said that we were going to reform that in this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=1994.898s">I</a>  guess I'm trying to understand how those things fit together and why we would invest in changes to the facade of the building when we haven't made decisions about the vision for the high school as a larger unit in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2012.871s">And</a>  I'm just wondering when that committee of the whole is scheduled for, for the vision committee.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2017.854s">If</a>  I may, through the chair, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2022.84s">high</a>  school vision committee will be at our next, the next committee of the whole is scheduled for December 7th, the same day as our upcoming school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2035.488s">So</a>  that was going to be the next agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2039.39s">At</a>  the building and grounds committee, where they were talking about the bricks, the brick project that had already started, the fundraiser that was ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2047.695s">And</a>  so in the context of the brick project, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2052.297s">which</a>  was to beautify the bricks and the front entrance, the conversation continued to happen about, while they're fixing the bricks, what about the other pieces? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2065.021s">Like,</a>  why don't we continue fixing? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2067.141s">So</a>  it was more of a conversation and the architect showed <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2074.343s">his</a>  sample drawings that his son and some other of our young Medford students had worked on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2082.148s">He</a>  gave them an opportunity and shared that presentation of what it could possibly look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2087.912s">But</a>  nothing was set in stone, if I may use that expression. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2093.875s">But</a>  it was more where they were talking about the BRICS and the BRIC fundraiser that's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2101.84s">that</a>  the bricks would be laid at the front of the main entrance, what would it look like taking out some bricks? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2109.782s">And</a>  so it was almost kind of like, well, if you're going to fix this, you don't want everything around it to look horrible because you won't even see the beauty of the bricks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2119.385s">But</a>  the intention definitely is to have the high school vision committee in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2126.886s">So</a>  we were shooting for the December <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2129.522s">seventh</a>  meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2131.503s">There</a>  were two things we were trying to go back and forth with, but the vision committee is definitely an upcoming committee of the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2141.47s">So</a>  rest assured you'll be getting that invite soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2144.212s">We're</a>  just trying to balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2145.973s">That</a>  might need a little more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2148.274s">And</a>  if we think we need a little more time, we might need to play with what day we could start that so that we don't shortchange that conversation.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2161.027s">And</a>  there's reference in the minutes to these design drawings that weren't included in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2168.495s">And</a>  I just wondered if somebody could include it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2170.417s">Sounds</a>  like <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2171.273s">It's</a>  really great work and I definitely would want to see us invite the people who have already participated to be part of the application process for the vision committee, which we can talk about next time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2182.677s">But</a>  I'm really curious to sort of see and envision what it might look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2187.739s">But</a>  to your point about installing bricks and not having a bigger plan, I think that's why the vision committee is so critical because every expenditure that we talk about, bathrooms, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2200.863s">you</a>  know all kinds of things really should you know should be tied into like where does this where does this fit in our sort of master plan which we don't really have right now so I definitely want to see us prioritize that because I think it answers a lot of questions and helps guide us into the future if we take the time to have a thoughtful conversation about that vision sooner rather than later and I know we're already you know <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2229.8s">unavoidably</a>  delayed that discussion, but I think that's really important.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2235.004s">Your</a>  point what you just were saying that was part of. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2237.946s">I</a>  think people actually see what was presented at the building and ground subcommittee that the the Mustang nation out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2247.793s">they</a>  will be inspired and excited about what those new bricks could end up looking like. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2254.336s">So</a>  I completely agree and we can definitely get that information to all of you and let you see what they were samples, but to at least be able to weigh in so that when we have that committee of the whole, we can show some of that information and the pictures again, images so that <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2275.765s">people</a>  can have a richer discussion about that.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2279.428s">And</a>  then Kathy, in your notes, you also referenced that we have run out of money for the projects that we're going to be paid for out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2287.613s">But</a>  I don't recall that your notes said what the next steps were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2293.157s">If</a>  we're running out of money, what does that mean for those projects? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2295.739s">Does</a>  it mean they don't happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2298.981s">Does</a>  it mean we do half of a project? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2300.682s">Like,</a>  what is the plan?</p>

    <p>[Kreatz]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2303.485s">we</a>  would have to go to city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2306.246s">We'd</a>  have to maybe have John McLaughlin would meet with Mr. Murphy and, you know, discuss what the next steps would be if they're going over because they, you know, John's concerns were that it's going to be a problem to do the generator and the bathrooms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2323.594s">There</a>  isn't going to be enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2326.456s">So,</a>  I mean, I would think that we would have to go to city council to ask for additional money.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2333.017s">What</a>  about the 800,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2333.597s">Yeah,</a>  member, Mr. Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2337.36s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2338.181s">So</a>  there is an allocation, an appropriation that was made in the last week of August, totaling approximately $800,000 that is earmarked for capital improvements at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2349.648s">We</a>  sought that funding at the time because we had been, an earlier interpretation of the CARES Act funding suggested that some of the emergency HVAC work <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2362.395s">and</a>  some of the other infrastructure projects that were gonna be related to meeting the heightened air quality standards for having school in the midst of the pandemic, that funding was sought in part because of an expectation that it was gonna be necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2380.964s">A</a>  newer or more recent interpretation of the CARES Act funding positioned us where we're able to essentially draw down on that funding, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2391.34s">We</a>  haven't yet been able to finalize the priorities for that funding source because the price tag of what it will cost to put the high school in position to have in-person learning under the heightened standards hasn't really been crystallized yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2409.327s">But</a>  it's been our expectation from the beginning that some portion of that funding would potentially be applicable for <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2418.707s">some</a>  of these other capital improvement projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2421.368s">It's</a>  just, we're just not in a position yet to really be able to itemize those and say, this is exactly how much we're gonna have to put toward HVAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2429.291s">This</a>  is how much we're gonna have to put toward portable filtration devices. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2434.093s">And</a>  therefore this is the portion that we can squirrel away to help offset some of the expenses related to these, the capital improvement projects that have been ongoing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2445.135s">I</a>  anticipate that there'll be further discussion about all these issues and we'll be able to lay out for you once we have a clearer sense as to what some of those more sort of emergency oriented facility costs will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2460.638s">And</a>  then we'll know what our position is with regard to how much flexibility we have to put toward those other investments. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2469.239s">I</a>  do think that's an important point because at this point in time, and obviously the committee <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2474.655s">take</a>  whatever action it sees fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2476.056s">But</a>  the administration at this point is not actively seeking additional funding from the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2482.758s">And</a>  I think it's important that that point be made clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2485.479s">That</a>  could change, obviously, and it can certainly change by vote of the committee, but I think it would be premature to consider that at the moment, because again, there's too many open questions with regard to what will be necessary related to the HRAC funding and the other pandemic related expenses.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2508.548s">Rousseau.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2512.691s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2513.932s">Um,</a>  you know, I kind of would just emphasize a point that member Graham made about our intent to be involved in this playground resurfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2526.321s">Um,</a>  you know, on the surface, that was not intentional on the surface of playground resurfacing should not really cause much of a <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2535.415s">much</a>  conversation, frankly, from a school committee that's supposed to be working at the policy level. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2540.719s">But,</a>  you know, I wrote this post on my personal page a couple days ago, because I was surprised to see the resurfacing was done. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2548.445s">And</a>  what I said was, my children have finally been able to enjoy a part of the playground at their elementary school that has been broken longer than they have been going to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2557.372s">I'm</a>  thankful to the residents of Medford for the CPA funds that accomplished this maintenance work that was out of reach for so many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2564.595s">However,</a>  I ask that we as residents think deeply about our priorities, such that our schools have so little money that the playground is finally functional for my son now at the age of 14, and he's five foot nine, rather than when he needed it at the age of five years of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2582.239s">I</a>  want to celebrate this work, but it is really hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2585.54s">It</a>  is the unacceptable level of funding that leads us to a place where we celebrate basic maintenance instead of real progress for our children and their education. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2596.458s">We</a>  have much to do in Medford, but it won't be free. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2598.579s">And</a>  I hope we all will vote with our wallet. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2600.701s">So</a>  our kids have the basics because the truth is they do not have the basics and they have not for more than a generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2607.445s">So</a>  when we are concerned about resurfacing a playground, we're concerned about resurfacing a playground that there's no reason to believe that this resurfacing isn't a 20 year resurfacing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2619.734s">There's</a>  no reason in our financials. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2622.275s">And</a>  frankly, with a pandemic in progress, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2625.483s">doesn't</a>  look like it's going to get better. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2626.723s">This</a>  is a resurfacing that happened at these schools that is going to be a generation before it gets looked at again. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2635.806s">So</a>  I think it's really unfortunate that we have to care that much about fixing a playground and doing basic maintenance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2643.629s">And</a>  it's not why I ran for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2645.969s">I</a>  ran to actually improve the education. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2649.07s">And</a>  I think that's true of literally every other member, but you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2654.906s">this</a>  Medford is not stepping up and has not stepped up for a generation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2660.19s">So</a>  we have to care and spend 45 minutes or whatever talking about fixing broken playground equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2670.158s">I</a>  just think it's unfortunate that's where we're at, but that's where we're at. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2673.38s">And</a>  that's why I care a lot about the fact that we didn't <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2677.603s">stop</a>  and make sure it was right, because I do not see any reason to believe that within the next 20 years, we'll have so much educational funding that it will be just part of the annual budget to fix the playgrounds, whatever they need, so.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2803.817s">We</a>  do, we have two. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2805.018s">I</a>  will start in the order I received them. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2811.264s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2811.584s">This</a>  is from <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2815.081s">James</a>  Donovan of Boston Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2818.403s">Here's</a>  school committee members. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2820.344s">I</a>  submitted this email at the last meeting and I have not received an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2824.287s">I</a>  don't believe that most of these questions require research. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2827.769s">I</a>  was hoping I could get a response tonight in a public forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2830.89s">I've</a>  highlighted my original email below. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2833.532s">It</a>  is my understanding that the MPS has purchased new Apple laptops for every teacher while many of the district students navigate remote learning with inferior Chromebooks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2842.62s">I</a>  have been told by a committee member that they were purchased with funds from the state for the sole purpose of enhancing remote learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2849.467s">I</a>  was hoping to get the following questions answered at tonight's meeting in a public forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2854.252s">One,</a>  and I will stop for a moment between the questions in case somebody wants to jump in with an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2861.479s">Number</a>  one was, what was the exact cost of the laptops and accessories?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2871.862s">I</a>  believe we prepared written responses to these questions, but it sounds like perhaps the response did not get to the constituent. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2880.964s">It'll</a>  take me a minute or two to track down exactly the full response, but I've seen a draft of an email in which there was a response to each of the four or five questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2893.326s">But</a>  if you'd like to read them, I'd rather find the document and send it than for us to ad lib. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2901.852s">but</a>  I'll defer to the committee.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2904.513s">Okay,</a>  I'll just read the other questions and some of them don't require an exact dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2908.915s">So</a>  number two is, were they purchased with grant money? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2913.076s">And</a>  if so, what was the total amount of the state grant and which grant was the purchase made under?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2917.938s">I</a>  don't know if we have the... So I can answer that if you'd like. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2924.68s">They</a>  were purchased with funding from the CVRF School Reopening Grant Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2929.48s">providing</a>  resources to school districts to improve remote and hybrid teaching and learning.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2935.302s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2937.343s">Number</a>  three is if the funding source was FY 2021 Remote Learning Technology Essentials Grant, how was the MPS able to circumvent the focus areas required by the grant, that being the internet access for students or devices for students?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2952.468s">So</a>  there was no circumvention of anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2956.209s">The</a>  funds from the Remote Learning Technology Essentials Grant <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2959.403s">were</a>  used to purchase Chrome tablets for younger students and assistive technology, such as larger screen Chromebooks, iPads, headsets, and other various technology pieces of equipment for students to meet the needs of students with special needs in the remote and hybrid learning situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2977.687s">This</a>  equipment has not yet been received. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2981.088s">There</a>  was a delay in grant notification, a delay in the award set up by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=2988.581s">And</a>  we are seeing significant delays in the delivery of devices and resources by vendors and manufacturers as the supply chain has been substantially disrupted by COVID.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3003.447s">Could</a>  the funds have been used to improve the Wi-Fi at our schools, especially Medford High School?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3008.629s">So</a>  we are actually using $150,000 and that'll be discussed later on this evening, actually.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3015.632s">Number</a>  five, could the funds have been used to improve the remote learning academy?</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3020.835s">So</a>  the CVRF, specifically the school reopening grant program, funded teacher devices, internet improvement, Google Enterprise to upgrade the learning environment options, additional nursing per diem, and filtering for school devices outside of school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3042.289s">CARES</a>  Act funding provided student Chromebook devices <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3046.098s">Um,</a>  of which we've received a thousand of the 1800 reordered, uh, K to 12 content library resources for remote hybrid learning Lexia for assessing learning gaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3057.106s">Uh,</a>  we have purchased a substantial amount of internet hotspots for our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3062.91s">Um,</a>  I think we're in the neighborhood of 165 now, but, uh, that is a potential ad lib there. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3069.354s">So</a>  I apologize, but it is just, uh, we have purchased them. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3073.001s">And</a>  we continue to seek them to increase the internet capacity for students home and remote learning capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3080.987s">So</a>  we're using multiple sources of funding for that.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3087.792s">Thank</a>  you, that was the end of that email. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3091.094s">And</a>  I have one more email.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3092.896s">Point</a>  of information, did we answer the first question that Dave was gonna look at the email on?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3099.151s">I</a>  just forwarded to Mr. Rousseau responses to all five questions, but is the first question the exact cost of the laptops?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3107.638s">And</a>  accessories?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3108.959s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3109.3s">$1,159</a>  apiece. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3109.62s">And</a>  we purchased 520 of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3110.521s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3113.283s">And</a>  the next question is,</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3128.082s">Hello,</a>  my name is Latisha Rocha from Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3134.223s">I</a>  have the following question regarding the next steps in the hybrid plan for school committee members or administrators who know the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3139.944s">Vocational</a>  students are starting in-person classes and other high school students are meant to follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3145.785s">What</a>  has been done to address transportation needs for high school students? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3149.226s">A</a>  lot of low income students rely on the MBTA to get to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3153.186s">The</a>  MBTA cannot enforce mask wearing or social distancing measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3157.715s">So</a>  how is that this glaring safety threat being addressed by the school administration, especially as community transmission in Medford and beyond increases exponentially? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3167.077s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3169.018s">Well,</a>  I think the only thing I could say in response to that Mr. Rousseau would be that we are and we will continue to communicate to all members of the student body, including high school students who will be relying on public transportation and frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3188.332s">just</a>  based on their age, interfacing with the community in ways that younger students probably aren't as frequently on a continuous basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3198.575s">Because</a>  all of you have heard Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3202.136s">Ray's</a>  seven steps to live by in the midst of the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3208.698s">And</a>  continuing to circulate that information and being as vigilant as possible is to some degree <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3219.743s">the</a>  most insulation that the district can provide to students who are going to be, whether it be while availing themselves of transportation services or interacting in experiential learning environments or just living life, are going to face potential exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3241.117s">So</a>  I think it's something that we're highly cognizant of and something we're very vigilant about. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3247.842s">But</a>  I think in terms of MBTA enforcement, there is a limitation as to what the district can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3254.867s">Dr.</a>  Cushing, I don't know if you want to add to that.</p>

    <p>[Peter Cushing]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3257.589s">So</a>  the only thing that I would say to the email is at MBTA.com forward slash COVID-19. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3265.094s">The</a>  first bullet point is all riders and employees are required to wear face coverings while riding the T. Not doing so may result in fines or removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3275.326s">from</a>  fine issue, sorry, fine issued by the transit police. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3280.209s">So</a>  our buses in the morning, I've been told only carry students in speaking to the MBTA supervisor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3288.513s">They</a>  are doing enhanced disinfecting and cleaning. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3291.335s">And</a>  I've also been told that our buses, the first run they do is for our high school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3297.978s">So,</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3301.444s">As</a>  Mr. Murphy was saying, there's limits to what we can do for our high school students on the MBTA, but we ask them to continue to be vigilant and continue to wear their masks as best they can at all times when unable to be physically distanced.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3322.613s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3325.914s">Next</a>  up, we have number seven, report of superintendent <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3330.152s">Superintendent's</a>  updates and comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3332.094s">Dr.</a>  Maurice Edwards-Edmondson.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3334.996s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3339.74s">My</a>  remarks today will be a little lengthier because there are a lot of topics that I need to just update the committee on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3347.927s">So</a>  I just wanted to preface it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3351.97s">So</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3353.031s">The</a>  Medford Public Schools objective, first and foremost, is to educate our children. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3359.876s">safely</a>  and equitably. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3364.098s">To</a>  say it has not been an easy task during a pandemic is definitely an understatement. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3371.762s">But</a>  Medford has shouldered on keeping our students and families front and center. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3378.065s">It</a>  has not been perfect, but this is a playbook none of us ever anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3385.489s">It</a>  has taken many, many long hours of planning, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3389.533s">community</a>  and school committee meetings, discussions with teachers, administrators and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3395.377s">We</a>  have brought engineers into all of the buildings to gauge the air quality and commence repairs and upgrades where needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3403.682s">Nothing</a>  has been done haphazardly or recklessly. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3408.024s">We</a>  have planned every move and remained as flexible as possible as our context has evolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3416.002s">Our</a>  families requested the option of all remote learning and hybrid in-school learning, and we prioritized the family choice throughout our reopening process. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3428.128s">To</a>  that end, we have made significant investments in webcams, microphones, and MacBooks so that teachers could teach effectively, whether remote or live. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3441.135s">We</a>  have done all of this to improve outcomes for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3446.101s">It</a>  is my strong belief that bringing students back into our schools is critical for their academic health and social welfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3455.267s">The</a>  American Academy of Pediatrics, along with Medford's Board of Health and our own Health Services Department, support the return to in-person learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3465.954s">I</a>  will say again, our utmost priority is the safety for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3471.653s">Our</a>  students would never have been brought back without the approval of the medical professionals and listening to what the metrics are telling us. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3481.638s">Currently,</a>  we have over 1,700 students in our schools on the hybrid plan, with 1,260 students receiving remote instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3496.965s">Our</a>  schools often function as safety nets for many of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3502.487s">Our</a>  schools provide two meals a day, ensure that pupils receive their medication at the proper time and with the proper dosage. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3512.609s">And</a>  we are able to keep an eye on the students' physical and mental health. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3518.791s">Additionally,</a>  at all of our schools, we're offering grab-and-go sites that are providing lunch for families that are remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3528.633s">At</a>  the McGlynn Complex, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3531.093s">On</a>  average, it's 15 meals a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3537.895s">At</a>  the high school complex, it's 25 meals a week, and the Curtis Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3544.117s">At</a>  the Roberts Elementary, it's approximately 95 meals a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3549.019s">At</a>  the Brooks Elementary, 25 meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3553.621s">At</a>  the Andrews Middle School, 100 meals a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3557.562s">At</a>  the Columbus Elementary School, 35 meals a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3563.732s">And</a>  please take note that when we say meals, when students or families are picking up the meals, it's actually two meals, so you can double those numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3572.576s">They're</a>  picking up breakfast and lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3577.538s">I</a>  can say to you that today it was a pleasure to once again be out in the field to see smiles and excitement from both our returning eighth graders, students, and our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3589.848s">As</a>  humans, we crave social interaction and we will take it even with masks and staying six feet apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3598.656s">With</a>  this addition, Medford now has K through eight in school two days a week and 300 of our most vulnerable students in school four days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3614.629s">As</a>  I mentioned last week, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3620.032s">We</a>  are continuing to focus our efforts on removing barriers for reopening the high school to in-person learning as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3630.036s">I</a>  am optimistic about welcoming our high school students in a staggered capacity over the upcoming weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3638.558s">This</a>  Thursday, November 19th, we plan to begin welcoming a small portion of our vocational students <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3646.205s">both</a>  11th and 12th graders back for a modified schedule of in-person hands-on instruction. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3653.872s">Phase</a>  one will welcome six of our 15 programs to in-person learning at the high school and select field-based learning opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3664.18s">Those</a>  programs are cosmetology, culinary, arts, media, technology, health assisting, carpentry, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3674.659s">and</a>  electrical. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3677.02s">This</a>  is an exciting learning opportunity for our students, and we are grateful that our students will have this wonderful exposure to authentic learning in the field. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3688.566s">I</a>  have also shared that we have encountered some challenges with staffing and coverage as we continue to bring more students into our buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3698.18s">We</a>  continue to need additional support for our classroom supervisory positions, lunch recess coverage, and other non-instructional duties at all of our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3711.144s">We</a>  are seeking adults who actually enjoy working with students to come join our team and support our hybrid model a few days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3721.903s">So</a>  if there's anyone listening tonight and you think you're interested, please contact our human resources department, or you can go on the website and complete the form. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3733.569s">I</a>  want to say that last Friday, when I did the mini commercial, we only had eight people who had signed up as of Friday to <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3744.997s">support</a>  us in the supervisory roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3747.759s">I'm</a>  pleased to announce that right now we are up to 20 individuals who have taken on the challenge and said they're willing to come join and be part of Team Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3759.126s">We</a>  were hoping for 25, but we do need significantly more volunteers who are willing to work <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3766.63s">at</a>  the secondary level as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3769.835s">So</a>  again, we have 20 individuals who have signed up and we are asking for more if possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3778.319s">so</a>  that we will be able to ensure coverage, whether it's reverse remote or for non-instructional supervisory roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3787.803s">So</a>  if you're on the fence and you're not sure, you can also call our human resources and they will explain what those responsibilities will be in greater detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3798.847s">But</a>  I do wanna thank all of you who have signed up thus far. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3804.161s">As</a>  we continue to bring back more students for in-person learning opportunities, we do recognize that COVID numbers are rising across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3816.092s">While</a>  numbers are on the rise in the community, schools in general have seen very little spread. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3824.601s">This</a>  context of the low spread in schools has been critical in our planning of providing more opportunities for in-person learning of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3836.728s">Please</a>  be advised that we can't do this alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3840.25s">The</a>  community at large must work with us and continue to wear masks, not congregate in large groups, sanitize hands and remember social distancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3854.925s">Please</a>  remember that a high number of other communities that surround us are only able to offer remote learning opportunities to their students due to the high rate of transmission of the virus. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3869.496s">So</a>  in partnership with our teachers, we feel we are giving parents, families, and students options to access education in the best way they see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3882.505s">whether</a>  it's remotely or hybrid within the Medford public schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3887.51s">However,</a>  we must remain vigilant. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3893.076s">So</a>  in the event of a possible school closure, this decision would be made collaboratively. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3900.563s">Our</a>  highest priority is the safety of all our students and staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3905.553s">So</a>  a recommendation for school closure would be made in collaboration with the Board of Health and pertinent data regarding our community in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3916.278s">The</a>  school committee would also be kept abreast of any changes and deeply involved in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3922.981s">This</a>  is an unprecedented time, and the collective voice of school administration, the Board of Health, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Medford School Committee, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3935.068s">we</a>  are all committed to prioritizing the safety of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3940.55s">And</a>  if this decision needed to happen, we would use all media platforms to fully inform the school community and the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3952.315s">To</a>  that point, beginning in December, we are hoping for December 1st, the Medford Public Schools <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3962.166s">will</a>  begin to individually COVID test students to gather some baseline data. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3970.748s">We</a>  are in the process of working with our principals and administrators to coordinate the testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3978.229s">We</a>  appreciate the extensive work that has been done by nurse Toni Wray, our director of health services, along with all of our nursing staff, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=3990.803s">the</a>  City of Medford, Tufts University, the Broad Institute, Armstrong Ambulance, Mary Ann O'Connor, everyone working collaboratively to try to provide this service. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4005.907s">More</a>  detailed information will be sent to families in the near future, but please keep that in mind that Medford Public Schools, we want to keep not only <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4018.097s">staff</a>  and teachers safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4020.858s">We</a>  want the students to be safe as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4023.399s">And</a>  we are hoping that this is something that we will continue to do, and we will keep you informed of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4030.822s">Following</a>  my remarks today, you're going to receive a more detailed public health update from Marianne O'Connor and Toni Wray. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4040.845s">You're</a>  going to find out information today, later, about connectivity in our school buildings, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4047.064s">There'll</a>  be a report on instructional innovations, as well as contingency plans for our most vulnerable students, and a remote academy update report. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4060.696s">All</a>  of these reports will show how the Medford Public Schools continues to move forward in this most unprecedented time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4071.39s">For</a>  the community, again, I've mentioned it before, but I'm going to say it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4076.874s">The</a>  City of Medford, the Malden YMCA, and the Medford Public Schools, we are providing free grab-and-go meals for all kids ages 18 and under. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4091.805s">So</a>  kids or students do not need to attend the Medford Public Schools, and primary guardians do not need to be present to obtain the meals. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4101.523s">This</a>  program is going to continue throughout the school year, Monday to Friday, with breakfast and lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4108.105s">So</a>  this schedule is as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4110.946s">YMCA</a>  offers meals at Haynes Square, 1145-1, the Tufts Park Pool, 1145-1, Medford's Recreational Center, 1145-1, and the Willis Ave Apartments, 1130-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4132.728s">Medford</a>  schools, the McGlynn, Complex, Columbus, Roberts, Andrews, and Brooks, all of those schools offer meals from 11 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4144.433s">to</a>  12.30 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4145.993s">every</a>  day, Monday to Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4149.575s">Medford</a>  High School offers lunch and breakfast pickup from 10.30 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4155.237s">until</a>  noon every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4158.837s">Additionally,</a>  I know some of the school committee members mentioned this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4163.499s">Brooke</a>  Hoyt of the Board of Health told me today that they were in the process of putting together a group of volunteers to deliver meals to approximately 20 families. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4176.564s">A</a>  number of our teachers have already signed up with her to assist, and I want to thank them in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4184.967s">The</a>  West Medford Community Center is also collaborating with the Neighborhood Kitchen Restaurant to provide up to 200 free meals to low-income Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4196.92s">These</a>  meals will be distributed at the West Medford Community Center on Monday, November 23, from 5 to 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4207.984s">People</a>  will need to sign up to receive their plate either online or by calling the West Medford Community Center at 781-483-3042, and they will add you to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4222.269s">Plates</a>  will be available for pickup at the community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4226.871s">Special</a>  arrangements will be made for anyone requesting delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4233.742s">I</a>  have also included in your school committee packets, the virtual Fells Day flyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4240.085s">This</a>  year, virtual Fells Day is taking place on Wednesday, November 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4245.468s">And</a>  I wanna take this opportunity to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4248.489s">Ivy</a>  Carnabucci of our science faculty for arranging this opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4256.733s">A</a>  former Mustang is doing wonderful things in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4261.688s">Our</a>  former student, Mr. Justin Tseng, currently a junior at Harvard University and the chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project, recently wrote a commentary for WBUR entitled, The 2020 Youthquake is Coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4280.878s">In</a>  the piece, Justin discussed the importance of increasing numbers of young people, ages 18 to 29 to vote, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4290.408s">In</a>  his article, Justin spoke about having serious discussions about racial justice and the COVID response with his friends. <a

href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4306.171s">We</a>  are so proud of Justin for continuing his leadership role in college. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4311.231s">Once</a>  a Mustang, always a Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4315.272s">Also,</a>  our World Language Club, they are selling <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4320.472s">face</a>  masks with flags as a fundraiser. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4325.577s">If</a>  you're interested in one mask, it's $3, two masks it's $5, and five masks for $13. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4334.967s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4335.167s">Bobo</a>  is leading it up and you can reach out to her. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4338.69s">She's</a>  leading the World Language Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4342.414s">Unfortunately,</a>  due to COVID, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4345.248s">We</a>  believe that this is going to be the first time since 1889 that there will not be a Thanksgiving football game versus Malden on Thanksgiving day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4360.1s">That's</a>  really something to think about. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4362.562s">Medford</a>  and Malden have played each other since 1889, and due to COVID, this is the first year that it's not gonna be able to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4371.95s">But</a>  we will pick it up again next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4376.437s">So</a>  speaking of Thanksgiving, the school schedule for the week of Thanksgiving will be as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4383.424s">Monday</a>  and Tuesday will be regular days, but Wednesday, November 25th is our all remote day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4390.672s">And</a>  it usually is a half day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4393.227s">November</a>  26th is Thanksgiving, and Friday, November 27th is off. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4398.489s">So</a>  again, next week, instruction will take place on Monday and Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4404.972s">Wednesday</a>  is our half day, and Thursday and Friday, we have off for the holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4411.515s">Please</a>  be advised, again, that there will be no in-school or remote learning on those days. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4417.878s">Please</a>  enjoy the holiday. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4420.74s">Also,</a>  and this is very important, for those families who may be traveling to see family and friends over Thanksgiving, please think about the governor's guidance of not being in groups larger than 10 inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4440.77s">It's</a>  for everyone's safety, health, and wellbeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4444.812s">But</a>  if for some reason you are required to travel, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4449.613s">I'm</a>  asking you as parents on the honor system, if you do travel, when you come back, please take your child for free COVID test. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4462.097s">Free</a>  COVID testing is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4465.518s">You</a>  can go to the state's website and look up mass.gov forward slash stop the spread and find a location that's close to you where you can take your child for <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4479.141s">free</a>  testing before you return your child to school. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4484.083s">It's</a>  for the health and safety of everyone involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4490.665s">I</a>  want to say, and what would Thanksgiving be without a Thanksgiving poem? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4497.527s">And</a>  this is my last piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4500.248s">I</a>  want to share a poem with you from a wonderful Medford resident who's no longer with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4506.543s">She's</a>  a famous author. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4508.364s">Her</a>  name is Lydia Maria Child. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4511.806s">She</a>  was born in Medford on February 11th, 1802. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4518.889s">She</a>  is best known for the famous poem, Over the River and Through the Wood, which most people think is a Christmas poem. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4529.315s">The</a>  actual name of the poem is the New England boys song about Thanksgiving day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4537.208s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4537.528s">Child</a>  was an ardent abolitionist, prolific writer, and is ranked among the most influential women of the 19th century. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4548.991s">She</a>  wrote the first comprehensive history of both American slavery and the history of women. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4557.454s">Her</a>  Thanksgiving Day poem was written in 1845. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4563.175s">and</a>  gained its lasting popularity in 1874, when her friend, the Quaker abolitionist poet, John Greenleaf Whittier, included it in Child Life, an anthology of poetry for children. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4580.882s">Eventually,</a>  the poem was set to a tune by some unknown person. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4586.884s">The</a>  more modern song version is now considered a Christmas classic. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4592.342s">I</a>  would like to share the poem with you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4597.424s">Over</a>  the river and through the wood, to grandfather's house we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4602.626s">The</a>  horse knows the way to carry the sleigh through the white and drifted snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4609.329s">Over</a>  the river and through the wood, oh how the wind does blow. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4614.711s">It</a>  stings the toes and bites the nose as over the ground we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4621.322s">over</a>  the river and through the wood to have a first-rate play. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4626.705s">Hear</a>  the bells ring, ting-a-ling-ding, hurrah for Thanksgiving Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4633.429s">Over</a>  the river and through the wood, trot fast my dapple gray. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4639.432s">Spring</a>  over the ground like a hunting hound for this is Thanksgiving Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4646.276s">Over</a>  the river and through the wood, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4649.252s">and</a>  straight through the barnyard gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4652.274s">We</a>  seem to go extremely slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4654.976s">It</a>  is so hard to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4659.379s">Over</a>  the river and through the wood, now grandma's cap I spy. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4665.262s">Hurrah</a>  for the fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4667.584s">Is</a>  the pudding done? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4672.087s">With</a>  that said, I would like to take this opportunity to wish each and every one of you a safe, blessed, and socially distanced Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4681.971s">If</a>  you don't celebrate the holiday, enjoy the time off. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4685.532s">Be</a>  well, stay safe, and wear your mask. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4689.394s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4690.895s">Thank</a>  you, Dr. Edward-Vincent. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4696.717s">Member</a>  McLaughlin and Member Ruseau?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4699.998s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4702.003s">Dr.</a>  Edouard-Vincent, and happy Thanksgiving to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4705.847s">Thanks</a>  for the poem, appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4708.009s">Two</a>  questions I had. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4708.97s">One</a>  was, I really appreciated you sharing Justin Singh's article. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4714.335s">It</a>  was really... <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4716.192s">well-written,</a>  I enjoyed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4717.912s">And</a>  it made me miss Justin. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4719.513s">And</a>  it also brought to mind the question of a student rep for our school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4724.614s">And</a>  I'm wondering what happened to our student rep for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4727.854s">If</a>  somebody knows or if we can, you know, re-engage or something, that would be really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4734.896s">Cause</a>  I think it's an important role.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4738.496s">I</a>  will definitely be able to follow up with Mr. DeLeva and have our student reps online for our next meeting.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4747.225s">Thank</a>  you, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4749.528s">And</a>  then, you know, I understand from the last message you were saying, you're hoping to get more information to seniors, is that right, by the end of this week?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4760.258s">So</a>  we're expecting another report, as you know, reports, but we are expecting another report. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4766.499s">Significant</a>  progress is being made on the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4770.88s">So</a>  we are very optimistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4773.261s">We</a>  have a good amount of rooms that are now online and we are working with some of the restrooms and a few other critical areas that also need to be online. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4784.283s">But</a>  we know next week is an abbreviated week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4788.645s">But</a>  I'm hoping for. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4791.272s">possibly</a>  some good news on November 30th, right after Thanksgiving, or very, very close, if not the 30th, maybe by the 3rd of December, to possibly have another cohort of students coming in at the high school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4806.96s">So</a>  we are making significant progress and I'm equally excited, I have to say, about the 20 individuals who have signed up to join Team Mustang and <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4819.307s">you</a>  know, we know that a significant number will need to be at the high school where it is, you know, so much larger to have that supervision to support the reverse remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4829.849s">So</a>  that's the one piece that, you know, between now and then we get enough people on board, we should be able to make it work provided, you know, all of these other areas that originally were not online, you know, I know CAF2 is back online. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4849.414s">So</a>  good progress is being made so that as we have larger numbers of kids come into the buildings, we'll be able to continue with a staggered hybrid, starting with that.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4860.444s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4861.065s">We're</a>  looking forward to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4863.046s">To</a>  that good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4865.008s">And</a>  also wanted to say thank you for the food distribution and for specifically for, you know, working to help address those who are unable to come get the food. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4874.651s">I</a>  was really glad to hear that Brooke and the city are working together to make sure that our families are getting the meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4882.594s">So</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4888.636s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4890.577s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4893.177s">That</a>  was a lot, as it always is. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4895.238s">It's</a>  a lot to cover. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4897.598s">The</a>  number of meals being served, those numbers were, well, frankly, quite depressing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4907.321s">I</a>  mean, are we even talking 1% or a 10th of a percent of meals typically served?</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4917.404s">I</a>  would like to be able to present a more robust <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4923.659s">more</a>  robust meal numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4925.22s">I</a>  know with the other locations that I listed, I don't have the other locations numbers to try to figure out, is it possible that a significant number of our families are going to Haines Square in some of the non-school based places that they're getting meals? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4948.474s">So</a>  I actually would like to, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4953.109s">be</a>  able to present at an upcoming meeting what our numbers are, especially as we have more students coming in, of who's accessing the grab-and-go breakfast and lunch, and see if there's a way to figure out who's accessing the grab-and-go lunch at the other city locations, so that that could explain the discrepancy in some of the numbers there.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4978.356s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4978.877s">I</a>  think that would be great to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4980.933s">We</a>  have on our later on in our agenda, we are certainly gonna be talking about hunger and the snap gaps. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4986.637s">So</a>  those numbers were kind of hard to hear, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4992.682s">15,</a>  it's a tiny little number. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=4997.506s">15</a>  is probably served in like the first three minutes of school every day in a normal school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5005.712s">My</a>  other question was around, actually we have an update coming up on the, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5010.225s">public</a>  health stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5010.905s">So</a>  I'll wait on my other question. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5012.006s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5014.607s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5016.849s">We</a>  have number two COVID-19 public health update and testing update report. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5021.451s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5021.631s">Toni</a>  Wray.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5024.032s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5025.593s">Mary</a>  Ann O'Connor is not available to be with us tonight, so I will share a few bits of information that she passed on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5034.525s">Currently</a>  Medford is in the yellow zone averaging 21 positive cases a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5040.706s">This</a>  is the highest rate since last May or early June. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5045.847s">Our</a>  positivity rate is 0.96% and 50% of the cases are in young adults between 20 and 39. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5060.974s">The</a>  health metrics were changed last week by Governor Baker and now are based on the size of the municipality and also incorporates the positivity rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5072.52s">Cities</a>  must stay below a 4% positivity rate to maintain students in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5081.316s">For</a>  school-related data, the staff surveillance testing, since the end of September, we have tested over 2,500 staff members, meaning we've done 2,500 tests and have only yielded three positive tests to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5101.871s">That</a>  is very encouraging. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5104.813s">For</a>  student COVID activity in school, between November 1st and November 15th, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5112.533s">Nine</a>  students tested positive after community or family exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5119.376s">Six</a>  students are remote learning students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5122.558s">Three</a>  students are hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5125.639s">There</a>  were nine students that were determined to be close contacts from those positive cases and are being quarantined. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5134.643s">Four</a>  of those nine students are siblings. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5137.668s">So</a>  it is a family exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5140.61s">The</a>  remaining five were from community contact and not from in-school transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5148.795s">School</a>  nurses are presently monitoring 38 students for community and family exposure, which are unrelated to the nine positive school cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5159.942s">Staff</a>  COVID activity between November 1st and November 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5164.928s">There</a>  were three positive cases that were determined to be from community exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5169.311s">10</a>  staff were quarantined as a result of one in-school exposure, all tested negative after the exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5180.657s">Eight</a>  staff members are currently being monitored because of community and family exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5186.681s">And</a>  we have one staff member who was quarantined after a possible in-school exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5194.196s">I've</a>  received some emails regarding questions with questions and confusion about what defines an infectious period. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5201.793s">So</a>  I'll address that tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5204.355s">An</a>  infectious period pertains to disease positive person and is defined as a period of time when the person is capable of directly or indirectly transmitting infectious material. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5217.084s">For</a>  COVID illness, this is defined as two days prior to the onset of symptoms or two days prior to the date of a positive test, and it continues for 10 days forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5230.264s">It</a>  differs from incubation period, which is defined as the time between the day when one is infected or exposed with the virus and the day that the symptoms begin. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5242.091s">For</a>  COVID illness, this is defined as 14 days past the date of exposure. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5250.396s">I</a>  hope this is helpful as we try to explain quarantine and isolation dates to families and staff members.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5260.13s">It</a>  is, thank you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5260.971s">Rae.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5261.211s">A</a>  member so. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5263.032s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5264.854s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5267.035s">The</a>  minus two days, thank you for your report. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5269.878s">I</a>  know you're working round the clock, literally seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5273.06s">So</a>  I do greatly appreciate how exhausting this is for everyone in your profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5281.927s">The</a>  minus two days though, confuses me. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5285.35s">If</a>  I contract COVID today, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5289.077s">and</a>  I get a, let's say two days from now, I go get a test and I'm positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5293.839s">Minus</a>  two days makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5295.2s">If</a>  I wait 10 days and go get a test, minus two days no longer makes any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5302.484s">So</a>  where does the minus two days come from?</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5305.325s">That's</a>  epidemiology practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5308.086s">And</a>  your two days can be your prior to any onset of symptoms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5314.032s">In</a>  the absence of symptoms, they define it as two days prior to the positive test. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5321.475s">That's</a>  just the principles that we follow and that the Board of Health follows from the Department of Public Health Division of Epidemiology. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5331.58s">I</a>  wish I could explain it better, Paul. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5333.961s">I'd</a>  have to have one of the epidemiologists on here to give you that specific information.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5341.026s">It</a>  just fails basic logic. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5342.567s">So</a>  regardless of who says it, it fails basic logic. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5346.09s">So,</a>  I mean, I will accept that that's the current recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5351.734s">And</a>  if that's the current recommendations, that's what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5354.055s">And</a>  I recognize that when there's a huge number of unknowns, you have to set up something to work with. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5362.301s">But</a>  it also is hard to not acknowledge that it is illogical. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5367.245s">It</a>  is 100% illogical for an asymptomatic person <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5370.803s">who</a>  test positive, if they took a test every day, then maybe you could come to some kind of like two days make sense, but nobody takes a test every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5378.849s">So,</a>  you know, this working back two days and then if somebody was interacting with that person three days ago, they don't get contact traced. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5392.179s">I</a>  just find that to be a pretty massive gaping hole you could drive a truck through. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5398.618s">especially</a>  for asymptomatic people when frankly there's so little known about them even today. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5404.482s">So</a>  I just, I don't even know where to go on that.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5410.286s">I</a>  can give you names of people at DPH if you'd like to pass that forward to them.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5417.091s">Yeah,</a>  I went to the CDC website. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5418.932s">There</a>  was nothing that mentioned this two days backwards. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5422.414s">And</a>  as much as I want to trust our state, frankly, I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5427.006s">They've</a>  given us plenty of evidence that trust of them right now is pretty weak. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5432.888s">Giving</a>  trust to them requires evidence and they've given us the opposite of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5437.429s">So,</a>  you know, the CDC, while I realize it's presently politically slanted right now, there's nothing I could find on this two days back thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5453.333s">And</a>  so, you know, in my emails I did say, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5456.045s">Can</a>  I get a reference? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5457.446s">You</a>  know, I work in a healthcare organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5459.847s">When</a>  somebody publishes something, there's a laundry list of references to the studies, or even, you know, when there aren't studies yet, but you have to make an action, there's an explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5470.992s">The</a>  two days back, I don't know where that's coming from, and I would like to know other than somebody told me.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5478.987s">And</a>  we've been following the two days since, since March, including with the schools since September 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5485.19s">And</a>  it's been very effective with regards to no school transmission, except I think one case, if I have that correct, but.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5494.555s">I</a>  can refer you to this website, www.cdc.gov. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5500.698s">And</a>  if you, there's a PDF on contact tracing and it will explain that, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5509.725s">Contact</a>  defined as any individual who is within six feet of an infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more, starting from 48 hours before the person began feeling sick until the time the patient is isolated four days later.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5523.171s">Yeah,</a>  I did find that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5526.193s">And</a>  the CDC seems to be completely mum on the topic of asymptomatic patients. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5532.135s">Just</a>  searching for the words asymptomatic was pretty hard to find anything interesting.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5537.478s">We</a>  are learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5539.119s">This</a>  last eight months has been a tremendous learning phase, and we are trying to hold our students and our staff to the utmost mitigation strategies, and we are following everything that has been recommended to us as guidance from the Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5559.253s">Department</a>  of Public Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5561.514s">And</a>  in the absence of any other information, this is what best practice tells us to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5574.303s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5575.364s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5577.966s">Now,</a>  David Murphy can introduce some points from the upcoming student surveillance testing program.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5586.752s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5588.113s">Thanks,</a>  Toni.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5589.054s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5589.921s">The</a>  superintendent referenced this in her comments earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5592.441s">It</a>  was also included in the superintendent's communication at the end of the last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5597.142s">We</a>  are intending to transition from exclusively staff COVID-19 testing, which we have been facilitating in partnership with Tufts, the Broad Institute and Armstrong Ambulance since the end of September. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5613.225s">And</a>  we'll continue to do so through the end of this month. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5616.826s">And</a>  it is our <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5618.165s">working</a>  plan right now to transition to student and staff testing in the first week of December. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5626.709s">There</a>  are several variables that we still need to finalize in order to operationalize this and make sure that it happens and make sure that it happens in a way that is feasible and does not disproportionately disrupt the instructional day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5644.675s">two</a>  things that are important priorities for us, both with regard to this initial phase of student testing and any additional student testing that occurs in calendar year 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5657.681s">So</a>  as of right now, we intend over the course of the next week to communicate with families and disseminate appropriate consent forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5667.286s">And</a>  then within each school community, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5670.578s">to</a>  run student testing such that each student is tested once a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5676.1s">And</a>  so students in cohort A would be tested most likely once a week, and then students in cohort B and C would be tested on either Tuesday or Friday, respectively, depending on the individual cohort. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5692.595s">That's</a>  our current plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5694.596s">We</a>  hope to do three weeks of individual baseline testing throughout the month of December. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5700.077s">We're</a>  continuing to meet with the folks from Tufts to sort of determine how this is actually gonna be put into practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5710.159s">And</a>  as I said, there are a number of details that we still need to work out, but our priority is to do it in a way that is efficient from a financial perspective, and then importantly, does not serve to disrupt <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5721.118s">the</a>  instructional day. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5722.539s">Our</a>  hope is that by modeling this throughout the month of December, we'll be in a position to be able to do additional student testing of a slightly different type that we'll be speaking to you about in greater detail in December when students return in the new year. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5739.47s">So</a>  that's our plan right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5741.231s">We'll</a>  be communicating with families extensively over the coming days. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5745.234s">And</a>  it is something that staff and families should be prepared for. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5751.098s">because</a>  there will be a difference in terms of the administration of the testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5755.042s">It'll</a>  be rather than having it a centralized location, it'll be happening throughout each individual school. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5760.767s">And</a>  again, we're in the process of determining exactly what that will look like at each school and at each level, taking into account, again, the need to not be too disruptive to the school day.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5776.18s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5777.081s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, then Member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5781.254s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5781.955s">I</a>  guess as I'm thinking about the student testing, I'm thinking about, you know, my own child with a developmental disability and, you know, her responsiveness to testing and even frankly, myself, you know, I've had, I guess, five different tests now at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5801.771s">And</a>  I've only done one, the original one was the, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5806.374s">I</a>  don't know what else to call it, but was the really long sort of brain probe, if you will, which was particularly painful, uncomfortable, you know, not pleasant at all, and has progressively, you know, gotten better in terms of, you know, also because I make it really clear that I'm not doing that one again. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5826.63s">So,</a>  you know, to the superintendent's point when she was talking earlier about the stop the spread sites, I do want to say, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5834.776s">several</a>  members of my family have been to the Suffolk Downs Stop the Spread site, and I can tell you from a personal experience, that is a site where it's a very non-invasive, if you will, nasal swab that you administer yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5850.002s">They</a>  give you the Q-tip or what have you, and then you hand it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5853.603s">So</a>  it was probably of all the experiences, it was the most reasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5858.885s">But</a>  I'm thinking about this for our <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5861.446s">is,</a>  you know, for all of our children, our younger children, but also, you know, cohort A in terms of, you know, their ability, I guess, or, you know, my concern around the presentation of the testing and ensuring that the testing is the <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5883.222s">the,</a>  I guess, least non-invasive one, particularly for children who might not be that willing in the first place, so.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5890.824s">It</a>  is definitely the lesser invasive one, and that will be the case for all students where part of the looking at how we're going to operationalize this is determining whether older students will be trained to self-swap. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5906.189s">That's</a>  an issue that we're looking at, and we're looking to see what's age appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5910.333s">and</a>  obviously making sure that there's appropriate staffing support for all students, particularly those of higher needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5915.598s">But</a>  regardless, the type of test will not be the one that goes way up there.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5920.662s">Yes,</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5921.302s">Ray.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5921.623s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5922.681s">I</a>  did want to add, Melanie, that I've had conversations with Susanna Campbell, and she is going to develop some social stories that can be used with our students with disabilities so that they will be introduced to the process and will know what to expect during student testing.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5946.35s">That's</a>  fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5947.171s">And</a>  I guess I would just say, you know, to Joan and Susanna and yourself, that I would not limit those social stories to students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5956.141s">I</a>  mean, those really apply to our younger kids as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5959.144s">They're</a>  very visual. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5960.105s">They're</a>  very supportive. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5961.147s">It's</a>  a nice introduction. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5963.229s">So</a>  I would really encourage, you know, our general education team and our <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5967.413s">non-disabled</a>  families to get access to those social stories as well, because there's lots of them that Susanna has compiled a great database of, from what is COVID, to wearing a mask, to getting testing, all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5982.196s">So</a>  I would really encourage folks to let Joan Bowen know or let Susanna Campbell know if you're particularly interested in any of those social stories. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5990.718s">There's</a>  a nice bank of them that have been building. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5993.018s">So</a>  thank you, Tony.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5995.199s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=5996.895s">In</a>  relation to discuss the rapid test site, I'm sorry, excuse me. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6003.578s">To</a>  discuss how easy it is to sign up for testing at the Revere, stop the spread site, you go on mass.gov, under express COVID-19 testing site in Revere, it takes about five minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6019.365s">And</a>  I just signed my family up for scheduled appointments this Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6023.367s">And</a>  that's a way to get your children if you do have <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6026.485s">transportation</a>  to get your Children there to just kind of get used to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6029.586s">That's</a>  not invasive as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6031.146s">So</a>  I just want to bring that up as an option for families that are able to get to a stop.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6036.788s">That's</a>  a great idea, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6037.748s">And</a>  also you get the results back within. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6039.889s">I</a>  think we were under, you know, even 12 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6042.41s">It</a>  was crazy how fast we got the results back.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6044.83s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6046.011s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6048.111s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6048.571s">Yes,</a>  I actually used to stop the spread site and, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6052.492s">don't</a>  go on Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6054.614s">Most</a>  of them are closed, except a couple on Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6057.115s">And</a>  when people want to go on a Sunday, they go on a Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6061.078s">The</a>  lines were shocking. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6063.88s">But</a>  the site was free and quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6067.583s">But</a>  I had a question about policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6071.538s">I'm</a>  wondering if we need to have an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6074.26s">We</a>  have an approved policy that is on our website that says that when the metrics are eight cases are over in Medford per 100,000 residents, that we will be full remote for all students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6088.332s">I</a>  don't believe that is what we want based on the latest information, but it is in fact the current policy and I don't wanna <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6097.318s">be</a>  a bit of a jerk, but in a previous meeting was kind of thrown in my face. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6101.98s">We</a>  don't want policy that the superintendent violates. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6104.941s">That's</a>  a bad scene, a bad setup. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6108.142s">And</a>  we at present have a policy approved by this committee that everybody should be full remote right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6114.404s">So</a>  either we go full remote tomorrow or we have a meeting to fix this, because I don't think operating under a violation of the policy is the goal of our reopening dashboard. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6127.9s">So</a>  I make a motion that we have a meeting within the next week to adjust these metrics to take into account the governor's newfangled definition of what he personally thinks is important so that we can at least not be in violation of our own policy.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6144.587s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6147.649s">Yes,</a>  Mr. Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6149.65s">I</a>  don't, this is obviously completely up to the committee, so I apologize in advance if I'm speaking out of turn, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6155.578s">This</a>  topic is on tonight's agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6157.959s">And</a>  so if the issue is you'd like to essentially suspend or modify the metric in the sense that that's an approved policy by the committee, I think you do have that option. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6176.87s">COVID-19</a>  and the operation of our protocols is a publicly noticed agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6185.991s">Your</a>  discussion is appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6187.532s">And</a>  while I know it's the committee's practice, and I think a very sound one, that try to have the wording of a motion on the agenda itself, the legal requirement is that the topic be noticed, which it has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6199.657s">And</a>  so I think you would be potentially in a better position from an open meeting perspective to vote on this issue that you publicly noticed, as opposed to roll the dice on whether or not the issue would warrant an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6214.968s">So</a>  I'm just putting that out there as an option.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6217.469s">Yeah,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6218.329s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6218.649s">I</a>  think if we put a motion under 7-2 to not adhere to the metrics prior that we prior voted on prior, that would be sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6231.254s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6232.374s">Member</a>  Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6233.495s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6236.996s">I</a>  honestly cannot imagine that there are not a significant number of parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6241.859s">I</a>  would be shocked if the unions were not interested in the fact that we were gonna go to a situation where we had no metrics for operating our schools in a pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6250.723s">I</a>  did not actually agree with the metrics, but I think going to a no metrics seems a bit extreme, frankly. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6264.846s">And</a>  I can't imagine we will not have our flooded inboxes and some angry union presidents who are like, we've been operating under these metrics that you published and said, and we were okay with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6277.095s">So</a>  I just think going to no metrics right now seems pretty risky. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6283.119s">That's</a>  just my opinion.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6286.188s">I</a>  don't think we'd be going to know metrics. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6287.689s">We</a>  have the state's new metrics, which say if we go 4% or above with positivity rate, that we'd have to go to remote learning. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6297.073s">No</a>  questions asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6298.253s">So</a>  I think that's the metrics the state's using, and that's what I think we should follow. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6303.576s">I</a>  don't know if my colleagues have.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6309.918s">What's</a>  our current positivity rate? 0.96%. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6314.891s">And</a>  how does Tufts multi times a week testing factoring into that positivity rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6322.195s">It</a>  seems like it would be inflating the low number or deflating the number.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6332.221s">They're</a>  doing, I don't have the correct number on the top of my head, but they are going to continue through twice a week, each student.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6342.827s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6343.44s">So</a>  our positivity numbers are garbage. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6349.542s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6349.982s">They're</a>  heavily weighted to Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6354.484s">Or</a>  are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6356.304s">How</a>  many tests are happening? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6360.206s">Two</a>  per student, but most they're- But I mean in Medford in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6364.127s">And</a>  what percentage of it is Tufts?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6366.308s">Tufts</a>  is asking students that leave on Thanksgiving break not to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6370.389s">So</a>  the testing is gonna, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6373.387s">be</a>  reduced after Thanksgiving and further reduced after Christmas, which will potentially increase our positivity rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6383.369s">If</a>  we were going.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6387.79s">Okay,</a>  I'm not in favor of hanging our hat on a number that is problematic at best, but that's just me.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6395.072s">I</a>  just want to weigh in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6399.668s">Thus</a>  far, the transmission has been, it has really, really been limited at the school level. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6409.392s">Because</a>  we have, again, like I said, about 1,700 kids in school now. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6415.454s">And</a>  for the amount of kids that are in school, it is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6418.135s">We</a>  know the virus exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6420.056s">But</a>  the major transmission is not happening in schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6425.518s">It's</a>  happening in the community, or it's <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6429.935s">home</a>  transmission. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6431.616s">So</a>  although we've been impacted, it hasn't impacted the schools to the point where the schools cannot function at this point in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6439.998s">You</a>  know, I know that there are other communities that have significantly, significantly higher numbers and it's a different situation, but <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6453.6s">at</a>  least as far as where we've been this far, starting with the eighth grade this week, we've actually been in pretty good shape.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6462.823s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6463.664s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot, Member Ruseau, Member Graham.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6466.285s">Yes,</a>  I just wanted to ask if you could repeat, how are we getting permission for the students to get tested? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6474.748s">Will</a>  we have a blanket permission slip? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6476.868s">Will</a>  we have one? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6478.389s">Could</a>  you just go over those, that again, please?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6483.004s">We</a>  have a blanket that Desi has provided.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6491.152s">Desi</a>  provided a template for us that we could customize to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6497.519s">It</a>  does provide parent consent for blanket testing over the course of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6505.775s">We</a>  are working on getting that messaging out to families. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6508.878s">The</a>  letter has to be translated, but our goal is to get it out as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6513.982s">And</a>  if parents opt out?</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6516.264s">Then</a>  that is duly noted on the classroom roster so that when the testers are gathering students to swab, that we will have an accurate list of who has consent to be swabbed.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6531.356s">And</a>  that will be confidential?</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6534.605s">The</a>  list?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6536.667s">Well,</a>  I'm just saying that the teacher will know who opts out and not.</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6543.573s">Only</a>  by default, because you won't be bringing those students to the testing room. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6550.498s">This</a>  is very similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6551.98s">The</a>  process becomes very similar to vision and hearing and scoliosis screening that the school nurses normally do. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6562.262s">of</a>  which parents do have the right to opt out and some do.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6565.203s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6567.283s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6567.563s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6571.944s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6572.384s">Remember</a>  Graham actually asked a question that I thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6576.965s">Cause</a>  I had not fully contemplated the impact of Tufts on our, our positivity rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6583.306s">So,</a>  you know, unfortunately Tufts is not publishing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6587.527s">They</a>  have their Medford slash Somerville data. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6591.587s">So</a>  we don't know, is it 50% Medford, 50% Somerville? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6595.749s">But</a>  if we just took 50% of the students and said they were Medford, that is 3,000 tests a week at a positivity rate of only 0.26, which is a, I don't know how many tests are happening in Medford, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and bet the majority of tests that are happening in Medford are happening at Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6615.844s">you</a>  know, is this dramatically waiting and bringing our positivity rate down to the point where it doesn't mean a thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6622.947s">I</a>  mean, could we, if we subtracted Tufts, are we at 4%? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6627.909s">We</a>  can answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6629.549s">What</a>  I mean is the Board of Health with actual numbers and like individuals can do the subtraction and get that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6637.392s">But</a>  I feel like it's a bit unfair to say we're at 0.97 when the bulk of the tests that are probably happening in Medford each week <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6645.753s">are</a>  happening to a cohort of people that are getting very low positivity rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6653.035s">I</a>  mean, 0.26% is, I mean, we could really be happy with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6658.377s">So</a>  what is our positivity rate? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6661.617s">And</a>  I mean, the DPH site doesn't tell us because it includes this institution that's doing a great thing by testing a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6674.721s">but</a>  it's created this weird situation where I have no reason to trust that positivity rate unless they truly are subtracting all those. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6682.783s">And</a>  0.97 is non-student residents, which honestly, the amount of work and the fact that they had to delay release of that data now after Thursdays, I can't imagine they're doing that level of detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6695.685s">So</a>  I'm uncomfortable with just rolling it back to do what the state says. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6701.427s">I</a>  think we need real conversation with real data <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6704.143s">And</a>  I want to know what is our positivity rate minus the flooded Tufts number?</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6715.988s">I'll</a>  be in touch with Marianne O'Connor, and we'll have to get back to you about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6720.749s">That's</a>  not something off the top of my head I can calculate out. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6726.672s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6727.252s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6731.827s">At</a>  every meeting, we get a verbal update with a bunch of numbers that get tossed our way, but those numbers don't ever get reported in formal fashion. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6744.471s">I'm</a>  a numbers person, but I'm not a numbers person who can just ingest numbers spoken at me and be able to like simultaneously interpret those and remember them. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6753.873s">I've</a>  already forgotten what Tony said 15 minutes ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6756.314s">Can</a>  we, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6760.641s">When</a>  we talk about the metrics dashboard, we spent a tremendous amount of time putting that together so that at any point in time, anybody could go look at it and understand where we were at. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6772.006s">And</a>  we have not kept up our end of the bargain from that perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6775.848s">We</a>  are not publishing that on a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6778.469s">or</a>  not filling it out the way that we said that we would. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6780.671s">And</a>  I think we need to start to do that in addition to revisiting what we thought were the right metrics at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6789.177s">I</a>  will not vote for anything that just arbitrarily rolls back and puts <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6796.261s">this</a>  decision in the hands of a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6799.422s">That's</a>  not where I'm at personally, but I would like to see us commit to actually publishing data to the community so people can make good decisions for their own family. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6810.144s">It</a>  appears that we are taking the position that because we have provided options, everyone gets to sort of fend for themselves and make their own choices, which <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6822.267s">may</a>  be fine, that may be workable for lots of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6826.469s">But</a>  I just want to point out, our numbers are as bad as they were in April when the instruction was don't leave your house. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6832.952s">So</a>  all of a sudden, we're all out caring about our business, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6839.995s">But</a>  our numbers aren't that different than when we weren't supposed to leave our homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6844.817s">And</a>  now we're saying school is not transmitting things. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6849.399s">Which</a>  again, if that's true, it's great, but I would like to be able to sit with the numbers and understand that for myself, which I can't do when it's just sort of spoken at us. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6860.713s">I'd</a>  like to understand how complete the data set is. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6863.257s">So</a>  at various times we hear that <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6868.182s">contact</a>  tracing is complicated because people are not cooperating. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6871.423s">Well,</a>  if people are not cooperating, how are we concluding that school-based transmission is not a thing? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6877.565s">And</a>  then back to member Rousseau's point earlier tonight, like we don't know that somebody who's asymptomatic and test positive has only had the virus for two days, but yet we're using that and frankly providing instruction to people to not <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6892.43s">worry</a>  too much beyond two days when that may not be a good thing for our community spread anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6900.22s">And</a>  I just think this warrants a bigger conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6902.623s">I</a>  will say that I am, I think anyway based on what I can recall about the information that's been shared with us, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6910.072s">I'm</a>  surprised that we haven't seen more spread than we have seen. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6914.657s">Maybe</a>  that's because we have welcomed our youngest learners who have the least amount of, I'll say free will about how they move about the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6924.347s">Maybe</a>  that's why. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6925.829s">Maybe</a>  when we welcome back some of our <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6929.252s">more</a>  mobile students who have freedoms to move about as they see fit that we will see something very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6938.379s">And</a>  I don't think anybody, you know, and certainly not me, I don't want to see us have to close, but I want us to be clear about what it would look like if we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6950.368s">And</a>  I don't want that to feel like an arbitrary decision made by anybody because there shouldn't be anything arbitrary about how we make this decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6960.092s">So</a>  I wanna make sure that we're doing our due diligence as a committee, not putting this weight on the superintendent because that's not what we should be here to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6971.376s">But</a>  I think it should be a collaborative decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6973.377s">And</a>  I do think <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6974.817s">We</a>  need to properly post that this is what we're going to talk about, because there are a number of members of the community who I believe are not here tonight that would want to speak about this, either to say to stick with what we have or to change it or to do something else completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6989.402s">And</a>  I think we owe the community that courtesy as we have this conversation so I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=6996.955s">I</a>  think Member Ruseau made a motion to schedule a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7000.118s">It</a>  doesn't have to be an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7002.72s">It</a>  can be no to 72 hours out. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7004.922s">That's</a>  fine by me. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7006.244s">But</a>  I do think we need to have a meeting where we revisit what we're publishing, how we're publishing it, and what those metrics are that are going to drive us forward.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7015.917s">I</a>  just wanted to say that the metrics have been updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7019.02s">The</a>  only week that they were skipped, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7022.102s">Suzy</a>  Weiss, my executive assistant, has been updating it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7025.865s">She</a>  added the state's definition, but there were no changes to Medford standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7034.052s">It</a>  just was to reflect what the changes that the state did, which <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7040.217s">you</a>  know, impact where we would fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7044.959s">But</a>  I just wanted to say that the metrics have been a exception of the week that the state changed the day that they were giving the information out. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7058.584s">That</a>  was the only week where it did not change.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7061.645s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7066.927s">Point</a>  of information, Member Ruseau, then Member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7070.181s">you.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7070.301s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7070.501s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7071.121s">Um,</a>  Maurice, if that pardon me, Superintendent, if that is true, I will say that I can't find it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7076.964s">And</a>  the only place I can find anything is a reference to the October 15th one, which says that it will happen every week, but I cannot find that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7084.347s">So</a>  if that's true, it would be great if you could tell us where it's published.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7090.589s">Okay,</a>  I'm</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7101.058s">I'm</a>  feeling, you know, based on both constituent emails and the, you know, member Ruseau and member Graham's comments that I also think that a meeting would be <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7116.417s">helpful</a>  to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7117.677s">I</a>  think that with the metrics changing from the state level and with all of these unknowns, I mean, I'm going back again to my graduate level stats class and it's like, you can't compare apples to oranges and sort of, or change the data midway and sort of have these comparisons. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7134.663s">So</a>  I think it would be really helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7136.004s">I</a>  would also though concur with member Graham that I think we need notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7143.026s">I</a>  think an emergency meeting <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7146.007s">with</a>  is probably not as essential as it is to have notice to the community that this is what the meeting would be discussing, especially as we're thinking about, I mean, we're seeing every time I turn on the news, it's more, you know, dread and danger and mayhem. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7161.798s">And</a>  it's concerning as we're seeing the numbers rise. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7164.98s">And</a>  again, if you do a comparison, minus the COVID fatigue to the spring, we were all inside at this point, we weren't interacting with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7172.264s">And</a>  then you're dealing with this COVID fatigue and people are <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7174.906s">Interacting</a>  more and more and to the point of, you know, this, we keep hearing this data that this is not happening in schools, or that the shares not happening in schools or exposures not happening in schools but there's these unknowns as Member Graham and Member Ruseau were discussing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7191.017s">both</a>  of people who aren't responding to the contact tracing and or there's 50% that we don't know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7198.623s">I</a>  mean, that statistics put out there all the time, or there's 50% that we don't know how the contact tracing was. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7203.266s">Well,</a>  50% is a pretty large number. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7205.288s">We</a>  have information. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7207.049s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7208.25s">In</a>  general, 50% is not associated with our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7211.832s">We've</a>  been able to contact trace every case within our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7214.995s">Tony</a>  can confirm that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7216.095s">We've</a>  had one school transmission since September 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7220.057s">So</a>  the 50% is just community-wide, what Mary Ann O'Connor is facing within the community at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7226.36s">We</a>  do not have in-school transmission.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7228.921s">So</a>  50% that we don't know we don't have school transmission is what you're saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7233.123s">How</a>  do we know if we don't know? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7234.403s">So</a>  that's the state.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7235.524s">You</a>  know, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7237.345s">Ray,</a>  if you could comment on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7239.426s">We've</a>  been able to track every positive case and find out that it was from family transmission within the household. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7247.302s">A</a>  parent comes home from work, passes it to the children. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7250.143s">Children</a>  go in, find out they're positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7252.044s">Well,</a>  nobody else in that class has got it, and we've been able to trace it back to the parents.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7256.387s">That's</a>  been- That's 100%, not 50%.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7257.987s">That's</a>  100%.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7259.988s">Okay,</a>  that's- Point of information, point of information.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7262.93s">Point</a>  of information, member Ruseau.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7267.532s">Nobody</a>  else in that class has it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7269.413s">Unless</a>  you tested everybody in that class, how do we make a statement like that?</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7277.323s">anybody</a>  that was a close contact is notified and I would assume that we would get tested and we'd find out that's a very we are anybody identified as a close contact is advised to be tested at day four to five post exposure, which is a reliable time for receiving <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7298.186s">a</a>  positive test. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7300.208s">So</a>  we are passing on that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7303.431s">The</a>  nurses are following up with every student. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7306.793s">I</a>  mean, as I said, we have over 38 students that we are monitoring because of either a community or family exposure, and that has been unrelated to school cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7319.683s">This</a>  information is reported out to DESE on a daily basis, and they have also been able to aggregate data across the state, and communities are finding similar experiences as Medford, that the overall transmission is happening at the community and family level.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7343.764s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7344.905s">Mayor,</a>  I'm sorry, but still could member McLaughlin has the floor.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7349.227s">Sorry,</a>  member McLaughlin has the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7350.447s">You're</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7352.729s">I'll</a>  yield the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7353.549s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7354.91s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7358.252s">I</a>  personally know of a case in one of our elementary schools for which the source of that child being positive is completely unknown. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7366.816s">So</a>  stating that we know that every one of the positives in the school <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7371.186s">has</a>  been from a known source outside of the school is not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7376.127s">And</a>  I take great offense that that is actually the statement being offered up. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7382.729s">It</a>  is not true.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7389.33s">I</a>  try to follow up with every single case through Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7392.751s">O'Connor,</a>  and it's always traced back from what I've heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7399.253s">So</a>  I don't know, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7399.873s">Ray,</a>  if you've heard</p>

    <p>[Wray]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7402.648s">I</a>  don't have anything additional to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7406.912s">Paul,</a>  I really would like to hire you on my staff to do contact tracing, because it seems like you may have different skills.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7416.841s">Well,</a>  the parents have been clear that they don't have any idea where the child got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7422.086s">And</a>  the parents have been clear that nobody else in the family is positive. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7426.21s">So</a>  the child was in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7429.104s">This</a>  seems like an exact example of the opposite of what is being stated as 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7433.046s">And</a>  I'm sorry, but that's, the community needs to know that that is a pretty interesting interpretation of what I think are pretty simple facts.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7442.79s">Mayor,</a>  can we move the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7444.11s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7450.317s">I</a>  was just going to say that it seems, you know, Mr. Rousseau is presenting certain information that Tony's unaware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7457.338s">And</a>  that needs to be a private conversation between the two of them if information wants to be shared so that she can verify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7466.44s">Because</a>  at this point, it's only, you know, working on hearsay, if you would.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7473.061s">I</a>  have communicated that.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7476.342s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7479.016s">So,</a>  you know, I just, I'm not privy to the details of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7484.059s">None</a>  of us are, except perhaps the two of you, and somehow or another, it doesn't seem like it's really moving us ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7493.145s">It</a>  sounds like there's some will to have further discussion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7497.308s">I</a>  have a hard time because I know I'm not an expert. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7501.535s">I</a>  know I'm a school committee member who has great intentions and wanna do the best for our kids, but I'm not an expert on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7508.637s">And</a>  so that means that I have to listen to experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7511.578s">And</a>  in some places I'm a little worried because I feel like some perhaps of my fellow school committee members think that they can interpret things in a better way than some of the experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7523.442s">And</a>  I'm not, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7525.683s">I'm</a>  feeling a little uncomfortable about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7528.125s">I</a>  think that we do need to move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7529.646s">If</a>  we're going to have a meeting on it, where the potential would be maybe next Monday, if I threw out a date. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7538.773s">I</a>  don't know what the will of the entire committee is at this point about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7543.177s">I'm</a>  definitely feeling uncertain. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7546.359s">I</a>  understand arguments that I'm hearing, but <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7551.102s">You</a>  know, what are the major question is, I've heard some things about metrics and looking into how Tufts changes us, our potential numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7562.767s">Clearly,</a>  Mr. Rousseau is saying that the current policy that we have is not accurate and needs to be updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7570.909s">But</a>  at the same time, I heard the superintendent say something about that it was being updated</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7578.552s">What's</a>  posted, if you look at the actual metric, it says the week of November 13th. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7583.475s">I</a>  went to the website at the top, it said October 15th, 2020, beginning today and every Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7591.06s">That</a>  was when the header was posted, but the actual dashboard is for November 13th at the top, because it's looking at the previous three weeks of data. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7605.107s">So</a>  I just wanted to say, if you scroll down from the October 15th header, when we switched the day and said we would be posting it on Thursdays, the actual document does say November 13th.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7621.662s">A</a>  point of information, section three is not filled out and it never has been. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7626.286s">So</a>  there's some, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7629.292s">blanket</a>  language there, which is not the intent of what that section is supposed to contain. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7634.658s">And</a>  I've brought this up multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7636.44s">It's</a>  never been populated. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7637.821s">So</a>  when I say we're not even populating the things that we said we would do, that is what I'm specifically referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7644.529s">And</a>  so even if the metrics are updated as of last week, the dashboard is incomplete and it always has been.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7652.388s">I</a>  don't believe the school committee agreed with what you were saying you wanted in section three. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7657.352s">When</a>  you click on the hyperlink, it says the Medford Board of Health and Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7662.815s">This</a>  document was what we worked on with the definitions with the frameworks group. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7669.079s">We</a>  worked on this in collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7671.681s">and</a>  we talked about the different scenarios so I'm not sure what else you're asking for but what is posted is what we agreed to when we met as a group. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7681.529s">That</a>  I know.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7682.109s">Okay</a>  we're going to move the question member McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7692.739s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7693.139s">Yeah,</a>  I just for the other members, I guess benefit and for those that are listening, I guess what I think is being asked is that we have a meeting to discuss under what circumstances we would end up being all remote again, given what we're seeing in metrics as a whole, not just in the city, but in the country and <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7719.938s">to</a>  have a meeting to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7720.558s">Um</a>  as a state of affairs in general is that accurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7725.542s">Is</a>  that what the motion was to have a meeting to discuss under what circumstances we would. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7730.566s">Be</a>  going remote and what the no.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7733.408s">No</a>  my motion was to have a meeting to develop a set of metrics that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7746.817s">I</a>  feel like I'm a bit conservative in this approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7748.818s">And</a>  even I agree that metrics we have, we don't want to keep.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7752.438s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7752.699s">And</a>  I think the metric that you were referring to when I heard what you were saying was specifically the metric of what happens, the 8 to 100,000 equals remote. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7763.821s">And</a>  so that was where I was sort of <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7771.251s">My</a>  inclination is that we need to have a meeting to discuss under what circumstances we are going remote or if we were gonna go remote and what the implications of that would be so that we have that clear to the community under what those circumstances were. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7788.6s">Because</a>  as you said, member Ruseau, the metrics have changed both from a state perspective and not yet from a Medford perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7796.905s">So</a>  I guess that would be inclusive of what you're discussing.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7801.555s">Yeah,</a>  I would just keep it short to say to update our metrics to meet the current guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7813.701s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7815.181s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7816.722s">Sorry,</a>  I don't really have a more specific, I didn't come to this meeting prepared to say, here's some new metrics, let's use these. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7825.346s">That</a>  I felt should be a whole meeting with some time for us to get our heads in order and figure it out.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7835.272s">May</a>  we move the question, Mayor?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7838.353s">Yes,</a>  if I just may, before the question is voted on, just for the record, I don't feel, I have no problem having meetings, many meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7852.516s">I</a>  just feel like the admin and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7856.998s">Ray</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7857.618s">O'Connor</a>  are doing such a great job, not only keeping us all informed, but <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7863.618s">work</a>  in each contact tracing situation as best they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7869.022s">And</a>  I don't feel like us having a meeting is necessary at this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7874.686s">Will</a>  it be necessary in two weeks or three weeks if we see in-school transmission? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7878.429s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7879.609s">But</a>  right now that's gonna, my vote is based on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7883.092s">And</a>  I trust the administration and our board of health and head nurse of the schools to make these decisions, which I feel they're doing a really good job doing.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7893.635s">Point</a>  of information, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7895.717s">I</a>  just want to add, it's not that I don't trust the administration, I very much do, and I very much appreciate all of the work that Toni Wray and Marianne O'Connor and all of our administration has been doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7907.247s">I'm</a>  more interested in the fact that it's being communicated in advance to our families and our constituents in a way that everybody clearly understands, school committee included. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7918.176s">So</a>  it's not a matter of not trusting <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7922.529s">the</a>  superintendent or anyone else's decision making, because I do, implicitly. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7929.073s">But</a>  I want to make sure that we're all understanding what that actually means and under what circumstances. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7934.277s">So</a>  I just want to make that point of clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7937.319s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7938.059s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7939.56s">Mayor.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7940.361s">Member</a>  Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7941.662s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7941.962s">I</a>  also did want to confirm that this is not about trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7945.164s">This</a>  is about policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7946.225s">And</a>  if we don't do this, then the schools have to go full remote tomorrow, according to our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7951.189s">It's</a>  not an opinion, it's not the mayor has any more authority here. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7954.492s">Nobody</a>  in this room has authority to just keep the schools open in violation of our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7960.197s">So</a>  I think we should get our policy in order so that the superintendent doesn't have to walk this very weird situation.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7966.763s">Yeah,</a>  we'll never get the right policy in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7969.385s">This</a>  is a global pandemic that we're dealing with and situation's changing every minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7974.53s">So</a>  that's my no vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7977.474s">Move</a>  the question by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7981.037s">Roll</a>  call.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7982.098s">Member</a>  Graham?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7983.119s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7985.18s">Member</a>  Kreatz? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7988.543s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7990.825s">Member</a>  McLaughlin? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7992.426s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7994.307s">Member</a>  Mustone? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7996.569s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=7998.951s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8000.592s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8002.514s">Member</a>  Van der Kloot? <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8003.335s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8004.015s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8004.976s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8005.356s">Six</a>  in the affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8006.848s">one</a>  in the negative motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8012.73s">Next</a>  up we have report on connectivity in school buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8016.211s">Mr.</a>  Allen Arena, Dr. Peter Cushing and Mr. Dave Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8021.373s">Thank</a>  you Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8023.774s">So</a>  we're gonna just offer what I think is going to be a brief update and then certainly we'll be eager to take questions from the committee on <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8036.325s">the</a>  state of our connectivity issues throughout the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8041.227s">Dr.</a>  Cushing and Mr. Arena are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8043.268s">Just</a>  prior to this meeting, I did circulate a document put together by Mr. Arena to walk the committee through some of the specific challenges and some of the milestones that we've been able to cross with regard to ensuring appropriate <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8064.094s">Wi-Fi</a>  capacity and network connectivity during this difficult school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8072.356s">So</a>  I wanted to just start by saying that obviously technology, I think it's obvious if it's not, maybe it will be through this discussion, that our instructional technology and our operational technology have taken on a completely different role <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8093.462s">in</a>  the implementation of our instructional and other services to students this year with such a large population of students who are learning remotely at any given time, ensuring that we have reliable and effective network connectivity is of critical importance. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8114.254s">At</a>  the same time that the importance and the role of our internet has, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8120.457s">At</a>  the same time that our internet role has evolved, the role of our internet has evolved over the course of this year, we've been introducing new methods and devices of instructional technology in order to be consistent with the needs of all learners under the hybrid plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8138.708s">So</a>  as you know, and as we've discussed earlier tonight, we've made significant investments in actual hardware for <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8146.612s">both</a>  students and staff, MacBooks and Chromebooks respectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8150.913s">The</a>  MacBooks have been distributed and the Chromebooks to students are being distributed in waves. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8157.254s">It's</a>  noteworthy for this conversation because it is our impression that there have been some perceived network connectivity issues that are in fact more device-based issues and really just a matter of a continuous troubleshooting that our technology staff has been <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8176.896s">very</a>  responsive to families and staff in order to make sure that people are connecting the way that the devices are meant to connect and being able to take advantage of the expansive use of instructional technology throughout the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8192.052s">There</a>  have been some adjustments that we've made and Mr. Arena can speak in greater detail to those. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8197.79s">both</a>  as we've sort of shifted our capacity from our home network to our guest network. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8203.552s">That's</a>  a tactic that we're using to ensure greater connectivity throughout various school communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8210.035s">It's</a>  not an overarching strategy and it's sort of one sort of makeshift method that we've gone to to make sure that whatever devices students are using, particularly if they're not using a district issued device, that they're still able to have <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8227.817s">a</a>  good user experience. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8230.018s">Now,</a>  that obviously comes with risks, and that's part of what Mr. Arena and the rest of the tech team have been looking at on an ongoing basis to make sure that we're, in addition to providing a reliable and efficient network usage, we're also ensuring that it is a fully defended and safe and secure internet experience for all students and for staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8254.205s">There</a>  are a couple of significant projects that are coming up <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8258.391s">with</a>  regard to an expansion of capacity at the high school and the cabling project that will be important, particularly as we begin to have more in-person learning happening at the high school to make sure that that capacity is there to be able to sustain the uptick in the number of in-person learners. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8279.664s">So</a>  that's what we're looking at right now in terms of how the first couple of months have gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8284.947s">And</a>  I'm sure that there are <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8287.96s">both</a>  staff and families watching this meeting who have had moments of difficulty and stress with regard to the technology. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8298.243s">Again,</a>  that's not necessarily entirely reflective of systemic deficiencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8306.766s">It</a>  is a combination of factors of a tremendous amount of new technology coming into the district, new uses being put into practice, <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8316.133s">and</a>  some issues with regard to our capacity that we're actively working on to make sure that we have the network bandwidth necessary to support everything that's happening in each school community. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8326.981s">So</a>  we're happy to take your questions now and both in terms of what we've experienced and what we anticipate we'll be doing in the coming weeks and months to make sure that the structure that is necessary is there to support students.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8346.173s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8352.196s">There's</a>  no questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8354.157s">Mr.</a>  Teixeira, Dr. Cushing, anything to add or can move on to number four, which is the report on instructional innovations for our most vulnerable students, which is cohort A, report on contingency plans for cohort A, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8369.905s">Joan</a>  Bowen, Mr. Paul Teixeira.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8374.604s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8375.985s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8376.925s">Tonight,</a>  we'd like to review a slide deck that highlights some of the innovative practices that are being implemented during our start of September 28th till present with Cohort A. These changes have come about due to COVID-19 and how we've all had to adjust our daily routines and practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8398.053s">So</a>  we'll start with our EL. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8403.936s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8407.263s">So</a>  if Paul, if you want to start.</p>

    <p>[Teixeira]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8410.352s">Okay,</a>  so with the return to students on September 28th, we brought in our level one, level two EL students, K through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8419.317s">All</a>  of the teachers in the district went through PD sessions in August with better lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8426.66s">And</a>  the EL teachers took what programs they learned about through the better lessons and made them usable for EL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8438.446s">And</a>  they also put together PD for the, you can go to the next slide here. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8445.902s">They</a>  also put together PD for content teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8450.183s">to</a>  kind of highlight what are some of the best practices in working with EL students. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8457.549s">So</a>  this kind of covers some of the major areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8461.652s">Loom</a>  was one program which allows teachers to kind of record video messages for their assignments because our EL students rely heavily on auditory <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8472.38s">input</a>  in terms of direction and expectations and understandings. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8478.184s">Our</a>  teachers put together exemplars and then can actually record voice directions for our students using that. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8485.91s">Edpuzzle</a>  is another one that allows teachers to kind of embed open-ended questions, multiple choice questions on YouTube videos and teacher created videos. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8498.679s">And</a>  the next slide, Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8502.323s">Screencastify</a>  was something else that the teachers used and shared with their colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8507.726s">It</a>  also allows them to give auditory directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8511.349s">And</a>  then Vocaroo, they all have kind of silly names. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8515.411s">Again,</a>  you can give oral feedback to the students on an assignment that they've submitted through Google Classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8522.335s">And</a>  it also allows Yale students to <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8525.737s">It</a>  facilitates conversations between EL students and working groups and on papers back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/s-4VJY_TglE&t=8538.645s">All</a>  right, Joan.</p>
