00:06:05,807 --> 00:06:08,349
[SPEAKER_16]: So we met again on November 4th.

123
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:13,332
[SPEAKER_16]: It was a continuation of our previous meeting the month before discussing the calendar.

124
00:06:14,053 --> 00:06:19,376
[SPEAKER_16]: And we did not finish creating our list.

125
00:06:19,456 --> 00:06:23,119
[SPEAKER_16]: We will have one more meeting to actually put that forward to the full committee.

126
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:34,587
[SPEAKER_16]: We did make one recommendation that came out of the committee, and that was to move the, we have a current policy, which is that the committee, that the superintendent will put forward by May 30,

127
00:06:38,324 --> 00:06:41,945
[SPEAKER_16]: May 31st, the new calendar for us to approve.

128
00:06:41,965 --> 00:06:59,433
[SPEAKER_16]: And after discussion in the meeting, the subcommittee voted to move to the full committee to change that policy to have that occur in our first November meeting for the following academic year so that families can plan ahead.

129
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,634
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure that many of the members have received

130
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:07,235
[SPEAKER_16]: the same questions through the years of, hey, when does school start?

131
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:08,075
[SPEAKER_16]: When does school end?

132
00:07:09,536 --> 00:07:11,717
[SPEAKER_16]: By people who are better planners than I know I am.

133
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:14,218
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm always like, why are you thinking about next year already?

134
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:16,198
[SPEAKER_16]: So we did approve that.

135
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:22,981
[SPEAKER_16]: And so if there's a motion to accept that change to the policy, is there a motion?

136
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:31,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I make a motion to implement the policy suggestion from the Rural Equity and Strategy Subcommittee.

137
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,221
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have one question.

138
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:44,827
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to ask Dr. Maurice if that was okay and doable with the administration on moving it up that many months.

139
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:46,889
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something that they would be able to do?

140
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:49,751
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for this year, it's just going to be for next year?

141
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:52,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it was for next year.

142
00:07:52,846 --> 00:08:03,632
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was in attendance at the meeting and we had just talked about trying to communicate the calendar and everything much getting on an earlier timetable.

143
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:09,215
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we're gonna do our best to hit that new timetable.

144
00:08:09,295 --> 00:08:11,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were all part of that conversation.

145
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:12,637

00:08:30,415 --> 00:08:31,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van der Kloot?

160
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:31,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

161
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:33,577
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

162
00:08:34,358 --> 00:08:36,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

163
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,145
[SPEAKER_10]: If I could ask a question about those minutes, just because I wasn't able to attend, I know there's a lot of recommendations about different

164
00:08:44,626 --> 00:08:54,493
[SPEAKER_10]: holidays, are we leaving that up to the superintendent to do her due diligence and try to, are you gonna have another meeting to discuss additional holidays?

165
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:54,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

166
00:08:55,334 --> 00:09:06,561
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we have a list that we aren't really settled on that, whether it's an observance list or whatever way we're gonna end up calling it, which will list all of the dates that will be published each year.

167
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:13,026
[SPEAKER_16]: And there'll be a separate column that instructs the superintendent how to interpret that particular holiday.

168
00:09:13,534 --> 00:09:23,860
[SPEAKER_16]: whether it has to be a day off from school or whether it should be, you know, the teachers and special events should not be scheduled on those dates.

169
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,281
[SPEAKER_16]: So it sort of lays all that out.

170
00:09:26,421 --> 00:09:39,549
[SPEAKER_16]: And then this list can be used by the superintendent each November to go through the list, look up and, you know, a lot of these are, a lot of these religious holidays are based on a lunar calendar or other calendars.

171
00:09:39,769 --> 00:09:41,370
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, they're not like,

172
00:09:42,188 --> 00:09:49,392
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, not like Thanksgiving, where there's a third Thursday of November, they change quite dramatically through the years.

173
00:09:49,652 --> 00:10:04,159
[SPEAKER_16]: So there will be an effort, but it will be an effort of going through the entire list, looking for the ones where we've said no school, figuring out what the date is, and just using that as an input to the calendar.

174
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,261
[SPEAKER_16]: But that is not quite complete.

175
00:10:07,721 --> 00:10:11,983
[SPEAKER_16]: So that will be the next thing that comes back to the committee.

176
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:14,056
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you very much.

177
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:15,696
[SPEAKER_16]: You're welcome.

178
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:19,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to approve the minutes, maybe?

179
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:25,082
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to approve the minutes by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Van der Kloot.

180
00:10:25,142 --> 00:10:26,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Roll call, please.

181
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:28,163
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor, could I, I'm sorry.

182
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,104
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Member Ruseau.

183
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:36,348
[SPEAKER_16]: I just also wanted to, I don't have the recording for this meeting.

184
00:10:36,448 --> 00:10:41,550
[SPEAKER_16]: There is on page two in the bottom,

185
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:49,846
[SPEAKER_16]: parts of the minutes, it says, Paul Rousseau, there's a sentence in here that I don't believe that's what I said.

186
00:10:50,586 --> 00:10:52,667
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I did say it, I certainly didn't mean it the way it's written.

187
00:10:53,207 --> 00:10:56,789
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to just amend that to be whatever was actually in the recording.

188
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:05,013
[SPEAKER_16]: So right now it says, I believe in separation of church and state, but have come a long way towards respecting the faith of our community.

189
00:11:05,033 --> 00:11:08,715
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't have to go anywhere to respect the face of our community.

190
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,476
[SPEAKER_16]: I've come a long way to value

191
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:18,289
[SPEAKER_16]: recognizing each of these holidays and that that's an educational opportunity.

192
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:25,415
[SPEAKER_16]: But this sort of sounds like I came from not respecting the faiths of the community to finally respecting them and that is definitely not the case.

193
00:11:26,415 --> 00:11:32,780
[SPEAKER_16]: So wherever that recording is, if somebody could update the minutes to what I actually said, I would appreciate that.

194
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:34,662
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

195
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:38,585
[SPEAKER_06]: So roll call.

196
00:11:40,158 --> 00:11:40,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

197
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:41,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

198
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:41,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

199
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:42,960
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz?

200
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

201
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,981
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin?

202
00:11:45,741 --> 00:11:46,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

203
00:11:46,402 --> 00:11:47,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Mustone?

204
00:11:47,302 --> 00:11:47,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

205
00:11:48,103 --> 00:11:48,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau?

206
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:49,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

207
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:50,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van der Kloot?

208
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:51,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

209
00:11:51,745 --> 00:11:52,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

210
00:11:52,626 --> 00:11:52,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

211
00:11:52,906 --> 00:11:54,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

212
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:55,808
[SPEAKER_10]: Minutes are approved.

213
00:11:56,528 --> 00:12:01,411
[SPEAKER_10]: We have Building and Grounds Subcommittee, Member Kreatz, approval of the minutes from 11-5-2020.

214
00:12:04,005 --> 00:12:04,205
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

215
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:08,887
[SPEAKER_00]: So the building and grants subcommittee had a meeting via zoom on November 5th.

216
00:12:10,447 --> 00:12:11,588
[SPEAKER_00]: Subcommittee members, Ms.

217
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:13,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Van der Kloot and Mr. Russo were present.

218
00:12:13,828 --> 00:12:26,733
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in attendance were Mr. Cles Anderson, parent architect community board development member, Fiona Maxwell, procurement city of Medford, Alicia Hunt, parent and director of energy and environment,

219
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,916
[SPEAKER_00]: and Carolyn Montello Parent.

220
00:12:29,357 --> 00:12:36,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Also present were Chad Fallon, Paul DeLeva, John McLaughlin, Peter Cushing, and Dr. Edouard Maurice.

221
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:39,584
[SPEAKER_00]: First we discuss the upcoming 2021 subcommittee dates.

222
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:43,148
[SPEAKER_00]: So our March 3rd, 2021, 5 to 6.30 and June 2nd, 2021 is not good because of graduation.

223
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:44,349
[SPEAKER_00]: So the new date is May 26th, 2021 at 5 to 6.30.

224
00:12:57,725 --> 00:13:09,197
[SPEAKER_00]: After we discussed the career technical updates from Mr. Fallon, he mentioned that the only positive with the students not being in schools has been the ability to do updates at the Method Vocational Technical High School.

225
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:18,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the completed projects are the robotics and engineering, classroom lab and engineering shop, paint and labor were provided by painters union DC35.

226
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:25,087
[SPEAKER_00]: LED lighting was installed in many areas, thanks to Alicia Hunt for her help with that process.

227
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:32,892
[SPEAKER_00]: Programming and web development moved into a new space with 25 workstations, new carpet squares, paint and new computers.

228
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Construction technology lab, desks were built by the students.

229
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,791
[SPEAKER_00]: The current projects are cosmetology.

230
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:55,239
[SPEAKER_00]: A private donor gave $100,000 to put toward this program, provided for painting, electrical sinks, marble install of workstations, replacement windows, chemical mixing room, eyewash stations, and more.

231
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:58,261
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're on track to finishing in the next couple of weeks.

232
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:00,262
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to have a really nice name.

233
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:02,303
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be named the Priscilla Hoff Salon.

234
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:07,950
[SPEAKER_00]: The automotive and technology resurface the paint shop floor at no cost.

235
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:18,384
[SPEAKER_00]: It was done by apprentices from painters union, the students assisted with the, with the design plans, and they designed a racing flag, like a racing flag design on the wall.

236
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:21,327
[SPEAKER_00]: The painting was an epoxy process.

237
00:14:21,788 --> 00:14:24,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Sherman Williams and Union shared the cost of the paint.

238
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:31,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Originally, Mr. Fallon got a quote of $65,000 and $99,000, but it was provided free of charge.

239
00:14:31,797 --> 00:14:33,538
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a once-in-a-lifetime project.

240
00:14:34,486 --> 00:14:49,100
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to extend my thanks, and we did at the meeting to Mr. Fallon, the students, vocational teachers, apprentices from the Painters Union, Sherman Williams, and the Hoff family for all the work that's being done to continue to improve the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

241
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,187
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, special thanks to Alicia Hunt for the support of her schools in finding ways to get energy efficient resources to all of our schools.

242
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:57,948
[SPEAKER_00]: We have so many great partnerships.

243
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:01,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I provided with the group with an update about the brick fundraiser.

244
00:15:02,013 --> 00:15:03,395
[SPEAKER_00]: It's currently on hold.

245
00:15:04,056 --> 00:15:08,742
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll, you know, update the, you know, the committee with any updates that we have in the future.

246
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:14,269
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we moved on to the discussion about the member high school front entrance.

247
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:18,372
[SPEAKER_00]: and Mr. Cless Anderson, parent of high school and middle school students.

248
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:24,675
[SPEAKER_00]: He's an architect and community development board member, shared a design of Meveritt High School front entrance.

249
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:31,158
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Andreessen met at the site earlier this summer with my fellow subcommittee members and a couple of other people.

250
00:15:31,878 --> 00:15:40,162
[SPEAKER_00]: After the BRIC fundraiser idea, he planned a design of what the front entrance would maybe visualize what it could look like.

251
00:15:40,862 --> 00:15:43,383
[SPEAKER_00]: He volunteered to put together an architectural design.

252
00:15:43,723 --> 00:15:51,124
[SPEAKER_00]: He went to the high school front entrance with five high school students who helped measure the design in the entrance and they counted the bricks.

253
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:54,005
[SPEAKER_00]: The current ramp doesn't seem compliant to the code.

254
00:15:54,665 --> 00:15:58,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Kless offered a plan to integrate a design into the brick work.

255
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:03,847
[SPEAKER_00]: The first idea was a map of Medford in blue bricks with personal messages that can be stamped on the bricks.

256
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:06,627
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have special bricks with landmarks in the town.

257
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:09,748
[SPEAKER_00]: The second idea was to put the Medford logo into the bricks.

258
00:16:10,288 --> 00:16:13,171
[SPEAKER_00]: We would need to think about whether it was recognizable by the eye.

259
00:16:14,032 --> 00:16:17,095
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, eye level or like, you know, from a distance.

260
00:16:18,096 --> 00:16:21,620
[SPEAKER_00]: The students offered an idea of a wave or scientific image.

261
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,562
[SPEAKER_00]: It showed a hue wave.

262
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:28,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Another idea of a simple repetitive pattern, smaller quantity specialized bricks.

263
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,189
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of options on how we can deploy this.

264
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Russo and Ms.

265
00:16:33,471 --> 00:16:35,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Van der Kloot expressed safety concerns with the current ramp.

266
00:16:36,513 --> 00:16:40,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Also discussed there were concerns about the sustainability in the white bricks.

267
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:41,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they get dirty?

268
00:16:41,756 --> 00:16:43,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Kless suggests using all new bricks.

269
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:52,682
[SPEAKER_00]: So we asked John, you know, if he could get back to us with the cost of what it would cost to replace all the bricks just to get an estimate on that.

270
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And then John also asked Mr. Klaus Anderson if he could do an RFP.

271
00:16:59,983 --> 00:17:08,206
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll consider, you know, the fundraiser after the project or maybe when we get the estimates and then maybe can meet again and talk about the project again.

272
00:17:09,557 --> 00:17:13,881
[SPEAKER_00]: Also on the call was Fiona Maxwell from the Procurement Department in Medford City Hall.

273
00:17:14,281 --> 00:17:17,764
[SPEAKER_00]: She was there to help answer questions and provide us with some information.

274
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:20,486
[SPEAKER_00]: She mentioned there were a lot of rules we need to follow.

275
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:23,188
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like we have a few different projects going on.

276
00:17:23,528 --> 00:17:27,371
[SPEAKER_00]: Project A is a capital project with new ramp, walls, and bricks.

277
00:17:27,832 --> 00:17:35,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Project B, whether the bricks can be taken out and also an ADA issue, an ADA ramp that needs to be redone.

278
00:17:35,918 --> 00:17:37,800
[SPEAKER_00]: The design work is exempt from limits.

279
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,701
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's over a certain $1 amount, it would need to be sealed for a bid.

280
00:17:42,042 --> 00:17:46,283
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, ramp and signage are compliant of 39M.

281
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:49,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Purchasing bricks and reselling them make a deliverable good.

282
00:17:50,105 --> 00:17:52,566
[SPEAKER_00]: Architect services make for a bigger project.

283
00:17:52,886 --> 00:17:56,548
[SPEAKER_00]: There were a lot of components under one umbrella that we were all talking about.

284
00:17:57,328 --> 00:17:59,789
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really appreciated Fiona being on the call to

285
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:02,471
[SPEAKER_00]: know, to guide us and help answer some questions.

286
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:10,337
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's going to reach out to john, you know, over the next couple of weeks, regarding some of the things we asked for, you know, for him to look into.

287
00:18:11,218 --> 00:18:15,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Miss Carolyn Montello, who's a parent, also volunteered at the site originally this summer.

288
00:18:16,142 --> 00:18:21,146
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's shown a great interest into helping us with this brick project in the design of the front entrance.

289
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:26,509
[SPEAKER_00]: She noted the original intent was to sell the bricks for scholarships, not to cover the whole cost of the work.

290
00:18:26,889 --> 00:18:28,270
[SPEAKER_00]: So she reminded us of that.

291
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,753
[SPEAKER_00]: And also like what we all talked about was that.

292
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:46,740
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people will get more excited when we maybe have some sort of a renovated design that we can show people and then maybe do the fundraising of the bricks once we have that design and it will be renovating the school and scholarship program.

293
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:58,585
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we all came to the conclusion is that the project has evolved into kind of a capital project now, a little bit more or a mix of a capital project and then the fundraiser.

294
00:19:01,066 --> 00:19:10,814
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and Dr. Maurice also, she expressed that this may need to be done in phases staggered over time with the goal of getting the change of a front entrance.

295
00:19:10,934 --> 00:19:13,636
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what our goal will be is getting the change of the front entrance.

296
00:19:13,996 --> 00:19:18,860
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first step is getting a cost estimate to determine how to move forward from there.

297
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:26,847
[SPEAKER_00]: So we did ask John to get some numbers on the different phases, especially those not ADA compliant or safe.

298
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:33,335
[SPEAKER_00]: and I just want to thank John McLaughlin, Klaus Andresen, Caroline Montello.

299
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:36,739
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I put Bill McLaughlin in the minutes.

300
00:19:36,899 --> 00:19:39,262
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be Bill Carr, sorry.

301
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:41,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Susie, would you be able to update that?

302
00:19:41,685 --> 00:19:43,187
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I just noticed it right now.

303
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:46,390
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting names mixed up, should say Bill Carr.

304
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:51,274
[SPEAKER_00]: And the students for their volunteering and assisting with design.

305
00:19:51,294 --> 00:20:01,363
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I thought that was so wonderful that the students went out and they enjoyed what Mr. Andres has said was they enjoyed coming up with designs and counting the bricks.

306
00:20:01,503 --> 00:20:04,486
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just a wonderful to hear that report.

307
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:10,311
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are very fortunate to have everybody helping us with these future plans and maybe future architects.

308
00:20:11,505 --> 00:20:12,105
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

309
00:20:12,526 --> 00:20:12,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

310
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:13,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

311
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:14,507
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no problem.

312
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:14,867
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

313
00:20:15,067 --> 00:20:15,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

314
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,088
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

315
00:20:16,108 --> 00:20:16,688
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have more.

316
00:20:17,288 --> 00:20:18,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you just had a couple more.

317
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,410
[SPEAKER_00]: There was.

318
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,473
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really involved meeting, and I couldn't really cut out a lot.

319
00:20:26,634 --> 00:20:27,554
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just run through.

320
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:29,535
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have them bulleted right now.

321
00:20:29,956 --> 00:20:33,938
[SPEAKER_00]: So john McLaughlin provided updates with see building project.

322
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:36,219
[SPEAKER_00]: He's waiting for the bathrooms.

323
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:38,601
[SPEAKER_00]: He's waiting for tiles, samples.

324
00:20:39,181 --> 00:20:43,864
[SPEAKER_00]: He's looking at colors to look the same as the science lab bathrooms.

325
00:20:44,265 --> 00:20:46,206
[SPEAKER_00]: The treads on the stairs are done.

326
00:20:46,226 --> 00:20:49,748
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you remember that we went on that walkthrough and the treads are done.

327
00:20:50,169 --> 00:20:52,650
[SPEAKER_00]: The emergency generator is going to cost over $200,000.

328
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:57,434
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only $160,000 left in free cash.

329
00:20:57,914 --> 00:21:03,598
[SPEAKER_00]: Between the bathroom project and the generator, we are going to be running into money problems with both of those projects.

330
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,901
[SPEAKER_00]: The Andrews school roof finished this summer.

331
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:09,042
[SPEAKER_00]: The solar project will finish next summer.

332
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,904
[SPEAKER_00]: Speed signs are on order.

333
00:21:11,184 --> 00:21:13,526
[SPEAKER_00]: The locations are not set in stone, but they're on order.

334
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:20,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Playground resurfacing, money from the grant CPA, the Columbus and the Brooks are resurfaced.

335
00:21:20,352 --> 00:21:23,094
[SPEAKER_00]: All the broken equipment was replaced before resurfacing.

336
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:26,938
[SPEAKER_00]: John is going to get some pictures as soon as he can and share them at an upcoming meeting.

337
00:21:27,498 --> 00:21:35,252
[SPEAKER_00]: The radio project system being updated district wide, we have provided new radios to the principal offices and all would be linked to the police in the fire.

338
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Cushing provided an update on the McGlynn complex.

339
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:43,747
[SPEAKER_00]: They have $40,000 for design at McGlynn.

340
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:49,048
[SPEAKER_00]: They were reaching out to the city side to make sure that we have procurement done for the soft surface of the playground.

341
00:21:49,328 --> 00:21:58,370
[SPEAKER_00]: The McGlynn was more prone to flooding, and also they're looking for something for students of all abilities and paths in life to give a better access to the playground.

342
00:21:59,601 --> 00:22:04,644
[SPEAKER_00]: And Alicia Height informed us that she is looking at the solar battery storage at the McGlynn School.

343
00:22:04,964 --> 00:22:07,506
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is to have the noisy work done over the spring break.

344
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:10,508
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Cushing asked if we could do this at the McGlynn.

345
00:22:10,968 --> 00:22:14,791
[SPEAKER_00]: And Alicia Hunt replied, if we did the roof over first, we could do it.

346
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:17,613
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he asked if we could do a canopy instead.

347
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:18,573
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ms.

348
00:22:18,593 --> 00:22:23,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Hunt replied that the upfront costs are higher for the canopy and the battery grant is a funded grant.

349
00:22:24,757 --> 00:22:31,325
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the meeting adjourned and you know it was a really really great meeting and I really appreciate everybody and all the attendance and thank you.

350
00:22:31,345 --> 00:22:37,272
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you Member Kreatz.

351
00:22:37,752 --> 00:22:38,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin?

352
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:40,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Kreatz.

353
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:42,700
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like it was a really involved meeting.

354
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,181
[SPEAKER_08]: It was.

355
00:22:44,281 --> 00:22:44,781
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot.

356
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:47,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I had a couple of questions.

357
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:53,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically, the concerns around the ADA compliance in the ramp.

358
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:56,648
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that you said Member Van der Kloot and Member Ruseau were also concerned about that.

359
00:22:57,108 --> 00:23:08,835
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering if you know or if John McLaughlin can share with us what the safety concerns are for the ADA compliance with the ramp.

360
00:23:12,397 --> 00:23:19,186
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe john mclaughlin I reached out to john yesterday to ask if he was going to be on the call, he is not going to be on the call this evening.

361
00:23:20,387 --> 00:23:24,012
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want, I mean we could put some questions together in an email.

362
00:23:27,969 --> 00:23:29,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's just not accessible.

363
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,291
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Mr. Member van der Koek, go ahead.

364
00:23:31,531 --> 00:23:40,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so the ramp, as I understand it, was put in to assist loading and unloading, particularly of the musical instruments and whatever.

365
00:23:41,996 --> 00:23:45,357
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was never meant to be ADA accessible.

366
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:50,240
[SPEAKER_06]: If you recall, there is an ADA accessible ramp at the front of the building.

367
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:59,685
[SPEAKER_06]: My safety concerns, though, is that because it is there, that it opens us up to concern automatically.

368
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:02,487
[SPEAKER_06]: As you think about it, there is no railing.

369
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:15,959
[SPEAKER_06]: When I come out of the building at night from a concert, I have been concerned on many an occasion that someone could make a misstep in the lowered light, even though we've improved lighting there, but it'd be highly possible.

370
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:32,163
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's for anybody, not only somebody who might also use the ramp, which might have some concerns, maybe wheelchair, whatever, it's clearly too steep for,

371
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:33,863
[SPEAKER_06]: safe wheelchair.

372
00:24:33,943 --> 00:24:40,865
[SPEAKER_06]: So, but that is not the designated ADA ramp, but it exists.

373
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:46,726
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, it was put in for, you know, all of a sudden it appeared and there was a reason for its appearance.

374
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:54,548
[SPEAKER_06]: But for me personally, from the time it's gone in, I've been concerned about it.

375
00:24:55,402 --> 00:24:58,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you orient me, member Van der Kloot, as to where?

376
00:24:59,003 --> 00:24:59,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

377
00:24:59,343 --> 00:25:01,943
[SPEAKER_06]: You're at the front of the building, and you're looking at the doors.

378
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:07,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And the ramp is, part of it is stairs, but the ramp is right there on the left.

379
00:25:10,005 --> 00:25:12,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, going into the theater doors?

380
00:25:12,265 --> 00:25:12,965
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, it's outside.

381
00:25:13,706 --> 00:25:14,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, outside.

382
00:25:16,426 --> 00:25:16,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Outside.

383
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:19,247
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've probably been up and down it 1,000 times, Melanie.

384
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:22,518
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure I probably have.

385
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:27,902
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just a steep, too steep ramp, and then the stairs are to the right.

386
00:25:28,342 --> 00:25:38,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, but it does not, but there is obviously the other ramp, which is fine and is totally ADA compliant, and it's not an accessibility issue.

387
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:39,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

388
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:48,155
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it's not so much an accessibility issue as my concern about what if someone makes a misstep off the side.

389
00:25:48,612 --> 00:25:51,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, it's a safety issue and maybe more than an accessibility issue.

390
00:25:52,282 --> 00:25:54,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you for that clarification.

391
00:25:55,189 --> 00:25:56,553
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it's not accessible.

392
00:25:57,198 --> 00:25:58,619
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not ADA accessible.

393
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:00,160
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, right.

394
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,841
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a ramp that's not ADA accessible.

395
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:02,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand.

396
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:04,323
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sure that's probably because of the slope.

397
00:26:05,704 --> 00:26:05,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

398
00:26:06,004 --> 00:26:07,545
[SPEAKER_08]: And the grade of it, but I'm not sure.

399
00:26:07,585 --> 00:26:09,046
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm not an expert, but I assume.

400
00:26:10,087 --> 00:26:15,911
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm, yeah, I would assume John is going to have to get somebody in there to, to think about that.

401
00:26:15,971 --> 00:26:16,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

402
00:26:16,151 --> 00:26:23,617
[SPEAKER_08]: And I, I would just say that obviously if there's prioritizing, it sounds like you said, Kathy, they're going to prioritize anything in that legal realm first.

403
00:26:23,897 --> 00:26:24,157
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

404
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:24,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

405
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

406
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,705
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the other question I had is regarding the resurfacing on the playgrounds.

407
00:26:33,506 --> 00:26:47,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the McGlynn School resurfacing, not just resurfacing, but playground as a whole was going to be, as you said, really focused on making an inclusive experience, an inclusive playground for

408
00:26:48,182 --> 00:26:49,402
[SPEAKER_08]: students of all abilities.

409
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:55,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm wondering, again, maybe this is a question for John or whoever was at the meeting related to that.

410
00:26:55,184 --> 00:26:56,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there an expert?

411
00:26:56,945 --> 00:27:00,506
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe it applies to the same, to the first question as well.

412
00:27:00,946 --> 00:27:06,848
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there an expert in the, you know, field, in the disability field that is advising us on these things?

413
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:11,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Mr. Cushing on the call, Dr. Cushing?

414
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he might, he is.

415
00:27:14,351 --> 00:27:15,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he has his hand raised.

416
00:27:15,952 --> 00:27:16,172
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

417
00:27:16,712 --> 00:27:16,852
[SPEAKER_17]: I am.

418
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:18,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, great.

419
00:27:19,009 --> 00:27:21,351
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, do you know the answer to that?

420
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:26,473
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have been awarded $40,000 from the Community Preservation Fund.

421
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:38,278
[SPEAKER_17]: And as the COVID shutdown happened, one of the things that we were doing was we were seeking initial ideas from various companies, architectural firms.

422
00:27:38,998 --> 00:27:44,441
[SPEAKER_17]: We now have to formally put it out to bid, given what we're looking for.

423
00:27:44,801 --> 00:27:46,962
[SPEAKER_17]: And we're really looking for someone like you said,

424
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:59,375
[SPEAKER_17]: an expert in the field, someone to guide the process to make sure that this is not just a regular playground, that it is an accessible playground for all children of all abilities.

425
00:28:00,035 --> 00:28:08,438
[SPEAKER_17]: And just a quick refresh is that the soft surface at McGlynn is enormous.

426
00:28:09,218 --> 00:28:12,700
[SPEAKER_17]: It would be over half a million dollars to replace Justin of itself.

427
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,560
[SPEAKER_17]: It's prone to flooding.

428
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:19,060
[SPEAKER_17]: and the elements are definitely approaching 20 years old.

429
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:30,364
[SPEAKER_17]: So now's the time given the size of it, the central location to everybody in the city, that is the time and the opportunity to really take a solid look at a true investment into this playground.

430
00:28:30,745 --> 00:28:42,089
[SPEAKER_17]: So we are right now working through the finance office to make sure that we have all of our appropriate things for procurement done so that we're

431
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,151
[SPEAKER_17]: very correct in that.

432
00:28:45,813 --> 00:28:46,113
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

433
00:28:46,193 --> 00:29:00,004
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know the mass office on disability who we've had come and speak in the past, I'm sure you know is available to offer expertise as well and I'll send that contact info to you too and I do realize that there were some meetings around.

434
00:29:01,225 --> 00:29:07,851
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, with some of the recreation and Boston Recreation and other folks who have done this before.

435
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:12,375
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to make sure that they continue to be included in the discussion.

436
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:15,417
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's best way to handle that, Peter?

437
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:17,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Cushion, just email you to follow up.

438
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:27,648
[SPEAKER_17]: You can email it a follow up or, you know, in the in the next week or so, once we are able to put this out to bid, we're going to be forming a committee.

439
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:33,297
[SPEAKER_17]: of interested parents, community members, students, to really be a part of this.

440
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,317
[SPEAKER_17]: The CCSR wants to help out with this.

441
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:44,541
[SPEAKER_17]: We were able to meet last fall, last fall, my God, blurring together, last spring before everything just shut down and abruptly ended.

442
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:47,682
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we really wanna continue those conversations.

443
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:56,025
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanna have a really good understanding and make sure that we maximize this money in having those community conversations and coming up with a well thought out plan.

444
00:29:56,631 --> 00:29:57,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

445
00:29:57,092 --> 00:30:09,545
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would really encourage someone reaching out to the chairs of the Medford CPAC and to the parents of children with disabilities in the school so that they're definitely part of that committee, that there are members that are part of that committee.

446
00:30:09,585 --> 00:30:10,526
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you so much.

447
00:30:10,846 --> 00:30:11,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

448
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:15,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

449
00:30:17,433 --> 00:30:18,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Grim.

450
00:30:22,081 --> 00:30:31,624
[SPEAKER_07]: On the playgrounds, we passed a resolution at our March 9th meeting to establish this playground advisory committee.

451
00:30:31,644 --> 00:30:49,888
[SPEAKER_07]: And the goal of that committee was not only to be part of the process around the McGlynn Playground Design Study, but also to look at all of our playgrounds for the ways in which we may have had small opportunities to make the playgrounds.

452
00:30:50,628 --> 00:30:50,695
[SPEAKER_07]: you

453
00:30:51,818 --> 00:30:54,419
[SPEAKER_07]: more playful and accessible and inclusive.

454
00:30:54,439 --> 00:31:01,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was surprised to see the playgrounds all dug up when I was by one of the elementary schools the other day.

455
00:31:01,461 --> 00:31:09,384
[SPEAKER_07]: So I feel like the intent and spirit of that resolution was that that committee would be formed before any work got done.

456
00:31:09,464 --> 00:31:20,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have passed that gate now, but I would ask that that committee be formed before an RFP goes out to bid, because if we don't have good requirements in the RFP bid,

457
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:25,921
[SPEAKER_07]: in terms of what our vision of making sure that the design firms.

458
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:37,284
[SPEAKER_07]: are including the right folks, know how to engage the community, et cetera, then we will have missed yet another gate where we could have had community input.

459
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:51,453
[SPEAKER_07]: We had a really great meeting in early March with a number of people who were interested in this discussion, who had really wonderful and particular ideas about how to do this at all of our playgrounds, not necessarily just at the McGlynn.

460
00:31:51,473 --> 00:31:52,833
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know, you know,

461
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:56,556
[SPEAKER_07]: Shortly after that, things changed radically.

462
00:31:56,576 --> 00:32:01,241
[SPEAKER_07]: We actually on our April 6 meeting talked about moving the date out a month.

463
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:03,643
[SPEAKER_07]: And so we're obviously well past that.

464
00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:17,395
[SPEAKER_07]: But I would ask that before an RFP go out, we go back to the resolution that was passed on March 9 and make sure that that committee is formed so that they can be part of the review of what that RFP is asking for and seeking.

465
00:32:19,043 --> 00:32:34,876
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, because we have already missed some opportunities in my opinion to have potentially, um, resurface those playgrounds with, um, with opportunities potentially that we now don't have because we have resurfaced those playgrounds.

466
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:44,383
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I would ask that we sort of cycle back to that original intent and make sure that we engage the community before we move forward further.

467
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:55,212
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I did have another question about the minutes of this meeting.

468
00:32:55,232 --> 00:33:13,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel a little bit lost because I feel like the discussion about the facade of the high school is sort of rolling full steam ahead when we put on hold the vision committee and said that we were going to reform that in this fall.

469
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:32,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'm trying to understand how those things fit together and why we would invest in changes to the facade of the building when we haven't made decisions about the vision for the high school as a larger unit in general.

470
00:33:32,871 --> 00:33:37,834
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just wondering when that committee of the whole is scheduled for, for the vision committee.

471
00:33:37,854 --> 00:33:41,477
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may, through the chair,

472
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:54,947
[SPEAKER_03]: high school vision committee will be at our next, the next committee of the whole is scheduled for December 7th, the same day as our upcoming school committee meeting.

473
00:33:55,488 --> 00:33:59,190
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was going to be the next agenda.

474
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:07,154
[SPEAKER_03]: At the building and grounds committee, where they were talking about the bricks, the brick project that had already started, the fundraiser that was ongoing.

475
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:11,377
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in the context of the brick project,

476
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:24,981
[SPEAKER_03]: which was to beautify the bricks and the front entrance, the conversation continued to happen about, while they're fixing the bricks, what about the other pieces?

477
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, why don't we continue fixing?

478
00:34:27,141 --> 00:34:32,743
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was more of a conversation and the architect showed

479
00:34:34,343 --> 00:34:42,048
[SPEAKER_03]: his sample drawings that his son and some other of our young Medford students had worked on.

480
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:47,151
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave them an opportunity and shared that presentation of what it could possibly look like.

481
00:34:47,912 --> 00:34:53,495
[SPEAKER_03]: But nothing was set in stone, if I may use that expression.

482
00:34:53,875 --> 00:35:00,819
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was more where they were talking about the BRICS and the BRIC fundraiser that's taking place.

483
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:09,702
[SPEAKER_03]: that the bricks would be laid at the front of the main entrance, what would it look like taking out some bricks?

484
00:35:09,782 --> 00:35:18,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was almost kind of like, well, if you're going to fix this, you don't want everything around it to look horrible because you won't even see the beauty of the bricks.

485
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:26,826
[SPEAKER_03]: But the intention definitely is to have the high school vision committee in December.

486
00:35:26,886 --> 00:35:28,267
[SPEAKER_03]: So we were shooting for the December

487
00:35:29,522 --> 00:35:31,483
[SPEAKER_03]: seventh meeting.

488
00:35:31,503 --> 00:35:40,529
[SPEAKER_03]: There were two things we were trying to go back and forth with, but the vision committee is definitely an upcoming committee of the whole meeting.

489
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:44,191
[SPEAKER_03]: So rest assured you'll be getting that invite soon.

490
00:35:44,212 --> 00:35:45,933
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just trying to balance.

491
00:35:45,973 --> 00:35:47,293
[SPEAKER_03]: That might need a little more time.

492
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:59,886
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we think we need a little more time, we might need to play with what day we could start that so that we don't shortchange that conversation.

493
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:08,314
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's reference in the minutes to these design drawings that weren't included in our packet.

494
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:10,377
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just wondered if somebody could include it.

495
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:10,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds like

496
00:36:11,273 --> 00:36:22,577
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really great work and I definitely would want to see us invite the people who have already participated to be part of the application process for the vision committee, which we can talk about next time.

497
00:36:22,677 --> 00:36:27,659
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm really curious to sort of see and envision what it might look like.

498
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:39,863
[SPEAKER_07]: But to your point about installing bricks and not having a bigger plan, I think that's why the vision committee is so critical because every expenditure that we talk about, bathrooms,

499
00:36:40,863 --> 00:37:06,117
[SPEAKER_07]: you know all kinds of things really should you know should be tied into like where does this where does this fit in our sort of master plan which we don't really have right now so I definitely want to see us prioritize that because I think it answers a lot of questions and helps guide us into the future if we take the time to have a thoughtful conversation about that vision sooner rather than later and I know we're already you know

500
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,503
[SPEAKER_07]: unavoidably delayed that discussion, but I think that's really important.

501
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:17,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Your point what you just were saying that was part of.

502
00:37:17,946 --> 00:37:27,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people actually see what was presented at the building and ground subcommittee that the the Mustang nation out there.

503
00:37:27,793 --> 00:37:33,776
[SPEAKER_03]: they will be inspired and excited about what those new bricks could end up looking like.

504
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:54,745
[SPEAKER_03]: So I completely agree and we can definitely get that information to all of you and let you see what they were samples, but to at least be able to weigh in so that when we have that committee of the whole, we can show some of that information and the pictures again, images so that

505
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:58,027
[SPEAKER_03]: people can have a richer discussion about that.

506
00:37:59,428 --> 00:38:07,513
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Kathy, in your notes, you also referenced that we have run out of money for the projects that we're going to be paid for out of free cash.

507
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:12,737
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't recall that your notes said what the next steps were there.

508
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,719
[SPEAKER_07]: If we're running out of money, what does that mean for those projects?

509
00:38:15,739 --> 00:38:17,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it mean they don't happen?

510
00:38:18,981 --> 00:38:20,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it mean we do half of a project?

511
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:21,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, what is the plan?

512
00:38:23,485 --> 00:38:25,566
[SPEAKER_00]: we would have to go to city council.

513
00:38:26,246 --> 00:38:42,954
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd have to maybe have John McLaughlin would meet with Mr. Murphy and, you know, discuss what the next steps would be if they're going over because they, you know, John's concerns were that it's going to be a problem to do the generator and the bathrooms.

514
00:38:43,594 --> 00:38:44,695
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't going to be enough.

515
00:38:46,456 --> 00:38:51,138
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I would think that we would have to go to city council to ask for additional money.

516
00:38:53,017 --> 00:38:53,557
[SPEAKER_10]: What about the 800,000?

517
00:38:53,597 --> 00:38:56,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, member, Mr. Murphy.

518
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mayor.

519
00:38:58,181 --> 00:39:09,608
[SPEAKER_15]: So there is an allocation, an appropriation that was made in the last week of August, totaling approximately $800,000 that is earmarked for capital improvements at the high school.

520
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:21,837
[SPEAKER_15]: We sought that funding at the time because we had been, an earlier interpretation of the CARES Act funding suggested that some of the emergency HVAC work

521
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:39,963
[SPEAKER_15]: and some of the other infrastructure projects that were gonna be related to meeting the heightened air quality standards for having school in the midst of the pandemic, that funding was sought in part because of an expectation that it was gonna be necessary.

522
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:49,187
[SPEAKER_15]: A newer or more recent interpretation of the CARES Act funding positioned us where we're able to essentially draw down on that funding,

523
00:39:51,340 --> 00:40:08,727
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't yet been able to finalize the priorities for that funding source because the price tag of what it will cost to put the high school in position to have in-person learning under the heightened standards hasn't really been crystallized yet.

524
00:40:09,327 --> 00:40:18,130
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's been our expectation from the beginning that some portion of that funding would potentially be applicable for

525
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,808
[SPEAKER_15]: some of these other capital improvement projects.

526
00:40:21,368 --> 00:40:28,911
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, we're just not in a position yet to really be able to itemize those and say, this is exactly how much we're gonna have to put toward HVAC.

527
00:40:29,291 --> 00:40:33,673
[SPEAKER_15]: This is how much we're gonna have to put toward portable filtration devices.

528
00:40:34,093 --> 00:40:44,137
[SPEAKER_15]: And therefore this is the portion that we can squirrel away to help offset some of the expenses related to these, the capital improvement projects that have been ongoing.

529
00:40:45,135 --> 00:41:00,218
[SPEAKER_15]: I anticipate that there'll be further discussion about all these issues and we'll be able to lay out for you once we have a clearer sense as to what some of those more sort of emergency oriented facility costs will be.

530
00:41:00,638 --> 00:41:06,579
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we'll know what our position is with regard to how much flexibility we have to put toward those other investments.

531
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:14,000
[SPEAKER_15]: I do think that's an important point because at this point in time, and obviously the committee

532
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:16,016
[SPEAKER_15]: take whatever action it sees fit.

533
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:22,738
[SPEAKER_15]: But the administration at this point is not actively seeking additional funding from the city council.

534
00:41:22,758 --> 00:41:25,439
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's important that that point be made clear.

535
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:43,466
[SPEAKER_15]: That could change, obviously, and it can certainly change by vote of the committee, but I think it would be premature to consider that at the moment, because again, there's too many open questions with regard to what will be necessary related to the HRAC funding and the other pandemic related expenses.

536
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:48,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Rousseau.

537
00:41:52,691 --> 00:41:53,252
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mayor.

538
00:41:53,932 --> 00:42:05,601
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, I kind of would just emphasize a point that member Graham made about our intent to be involved in this playground resurfacing.

539
00:42:06,321 --> 00:42:13,847
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, you know, on the surface, that was not intentional on the surface of playground resurfacing should not really cause much of a

540
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:19,678
[SPEAKER_16]: much conversation, frankly, from a school committee that's supposed to be working at the policy level.

541
00:42:20,719 --> 00:42:28,285
[SPEAKER_16]: But, you know, I wrote this post on my personal page a couple days ago, because I was surprised to see the resurfacing was done.

542
00:42:28,445 --> 00:42:36,471
[SPEAKER_16]: And what I said was, my children have finally been able to enjoy a part of the playground at their elementary school that has been broken longer than they have been going to school.

543
00:42:37,372 --> 00:42:43,957
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm thankful to the residents of Medford for the CPA funds that accomplished this maintenance work that was out of reach for so many years.

544
00:42:44,595 --> 00:43:01,139
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I ask that we as residents think deeply about our priorities, such that our schools have so little money that the playground is finally functional for my son now at the age of 14, and he's five foot nine, rather than when he needed it at the age of five years of age.

545
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:05,060
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to celebrate this work, but it is really hard.

546
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:13,982
[SPEAKER_16]: It is the unacceptable level of funding that leads us to a place where we celebrate basic maintenance instead of real progress for our children and their education.

547
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:18,539
[SPEAKER_16]: We have much to do in Medford, but it won't be free.

548
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:20,661
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope we all will vote with our wallet.

549
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:26,405
[SPEAKER_16]: So our kids have the basics because the truth is they do not have the basics and they have not for more than a generation.

550
00:43:27,445 --> 00:43:38,613
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we are concerned about resurfacing a playground, we're concerned about resurfacing a playground that there's no reason to believe that this resurfacing isn't a 20 year resurfacing.

551
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:41,535
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no reason in our financials.

552
00:43:42,275 --> 00:43:44,096
[SPEAKER_16]: And frankly, with a pandemic in progress,

553
00:43:45,483 --> 00:43:46,703
[SPEAKER_16]: doesn't look like it's going to get better.

554
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:55,186
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a resurfacing that happened at these schools that is going to be a generation before it gets looked at again.

555
00:43:55,806 --> 00:44:02,908
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it's really unfortunate that we have to care that much about fixing a playground and doing basic maintenance.

556
00:44:03,629 --> 00:44:05,909
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's not why I ran for school committee.

557
00:44:05,969 --> 00:44:08,370
[SPEAKER_16]: I ran to actually improve the education.

558
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:13,912
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think that's true of literally every other member, but you know,

559
00:44:14,906 --> 00:44:20,110
[SPEAKER_16]: this Medford is not stepping up and has not stepped up for a generation.

560
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:28,717
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have to care and spend 45 minutes or whatever talking about fixing broken playground equipment.

561
00:44:30,158 --> 00:44:33,320
[SPEAKER_16]: I just think it's unfortunate that's where we're at, but that's where we're at.

562
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,683
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's why I care a lot about the fact that we didn't

563
00:44:37,603 --> 00:44:50,445
[SPEAKER_16]: stop and make sure it was right, because I do not see any reason to believe that within the next 20 years, we'll have so much educational funding that it will be just part of the annual budget to fix the playgrounds, whatever they need, so.

564
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:56,886
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

565
00:44:58,267 --> 00:45:00,027
[SPEAKER_10]: So roll call vote.

566
00:45:00,787 --> 00:45:04,468
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, member Kreatz moves for approval, seconded by?

567
00:45:04,488 --> 00:45:06,368
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

568
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:09,911
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin, roll call, please.

569
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:12,392
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

570
00:45:13,693 --> 00:45:13,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

571
00:45:14,393 --> 00:45:15,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz?

572
00:45:15,574 --> 00:45:15,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

573
00:45:16,254 --> 00:45:17,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin?

574
00:45:17,575 --> 00:45:17,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

575
00:45:18,235 --> 00:45:18,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Mustone?

576
00:45:19,235 --> 00:45:19,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

577
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:20,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau?

578
00:45:21,476 --> 00:45:21,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

579
00:45:22,157 --> 00:45:22,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van der Kloot?

580
00:45:22,977 --> 00:45:23,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

581
00:45:24,257 --> 00:45:24,518
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

582
00:45:25,238 --> 00:45:26,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, 70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

583
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:27,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Minutes are approved.

584
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:37,490
[SPEAKER_10]: Next we have communications strategy and stakeholder engagement subcommittee member Graham, approval of minutes from 11, 10, 2020 meeting.

585
00:45:38,851 --> 00:45:43,573
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor, I'm gonna make a motion to table these to our next meeting if they can be added to the next agenda.

586
00:45:44,493 --> 00:45:51,275
[SPEAKER_07]: Susie asked me to include some additional things in the minutes and I did not get a chance to do that.

587
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:55,317
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanna do that before we provide the updated report to everybody.

588
00:45:56,177 --> 00:45:57,958
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I could make a motion to table.

589
00:45:58,486 --> 00:46:01,307
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to table, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

590
00:46:01,347 --> 00:46:01,807
[SPEAKER_06]: Roll call.

591
00:46:02,988 --> 00:46:03,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kress?

592
00:46:04,368 --> 00:46:04,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

593
00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:05,649
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

594
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:06,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

595
00:46:06,649 --> 00:46:07,430
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin?

596
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:08,210
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

597
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:09,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Mustone?

598
00:46:09,471 --> 00:46:09,791
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

599
00:46:10,211 --> 00:46:10,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau?

600
00:46:11,451 --> 00:46:11,651
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

601
00:46:12,432 --> 00:46:13,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van der Kloot?

602
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:13,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

603
00:46:14,012 --> 00:46:14,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

604
00:46:15,393 --> 00:46:15,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

605
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:19,215
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion to table is allowed.

606
00:46:22,636 --> 00:46:24,557
[SPEAKER_10]: Number six, community participation.

607
00:46:25,377 --> 00:46:26,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Public participation, emails,

608
00:46:27,683 --> 00:46:34,189
[SPEAKER_10]: questions or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

609
00:46:34,749 --> 00:46:40,054
[SPEAKER_10]: Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, your question or comment.

610
00:46:41,575 --> 00:46:43,597
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau, do we have any emails yet?

611
00:46:43,817 --> 00:46:44,998
[SPEAKER_16]: We do, we have two.

612
00:46:45,018 --> 00:46:48,441
[SPEAKER_16]: I will start in the order I received them.

613
00:46:51,264 --> 00:46:51,544
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

614
00:46:51,584 --> 00:46:52,425
[SPEAKER_16]: This is from

615
00:46:55,081 --> 00:46:57,743
[SPEAKER_16]: James Donovan of Boston Avenue.

616
00:46:58,403 --> 00:46:59,944
[SPEAKER_16]: Here's school committee members.

617
00:47:00,344 --> 00:47:03,746
[SPEAKER_16]: I submitted this email at the last meeting and I have not received an answer.

618
00:47:04,287 --> 00:47:06,688
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't believe that most of these questions require research.

619
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:10,750
[SPEAKER_16]: I was hoping I could get a response tonight in a public forum.

620
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:12,672
[SPEAKER_16]: I've highlighted my original email below.

621
00:47:13,532 --> 00:47:21,777
[SPEAKER_16]: It is my understanding that the MPS has purchased new Apple laptops for every teacher while many of the district students navigate remote learning with inferior Chromebooks.

622
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:28,806
[SPEAKER_16]: I have been told by a committee member that they were purchased with funds from the state for the sole purpose of enhancing remote learning.

623
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:33,211
[SPEAKER_16]: I was hoping to get the following questions answered at tonight's meeting in a public forum.

624
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:40,638
[SPEAKER_16]: One, and I will stop for a moment between the questions in case somebody wants to jump in with an answer.

625
00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:45,003
[SPEAKER_16]: Number one was, what was the exact cost of the laptops and accessories?

626
00:47:51,862 --> 00:48:00,383
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe we prepared written responses to these questions, but it sounds like perhaps the response did not get to the constituent.

627
00:48:00,964 --> 00:48:13,126
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll take me a minute or two to track down exactly the full response, but I've seen a draft of an email in which there was a response to each of the four or five questions.

628
00:48:13,326 --> 00:48:21,247
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you'd like to read them, I'd rather find the document and send it than for us to ad lib.

629
00:48:21,852 --> 00:48:23,493
[SPEAKER_15]: but I'll defer to the committee.

630
00:48:24,513 --> 00:48:28,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I'll just read the other questions and some of them don't require an exact dollar amount.

631
00:48:28,915 --> 00:48:32,996
[SPEAKER_16]: So number two is, were they purchased with grant money?

632
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:37,918
[SPEAKER_16]: And if so, what was the total amount of the state grant and which grant was the purchase made under?

633
00:48:37,938 --> 00:48:44,540
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if we have the... So I can answer that if you'd like.

634
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:48,842
[SPEAKER_17]: They were purchased with funding from the CVRF School Reopening Grant Program.

635
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:53,661
[SPEAKER_17]: providing resources to school districts to improve remote and hybrid teaching and learning.

636
00:48:55,302 --> 00:48:55,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

637
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:11,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Number three is if the funding source was FY 2021 Remote Learning Technology Essentials Grant, how was the MPS able to circumvent the focus areas required by the grant, that being the internet access for students or devices for students?

638
00:49:12,468 --> 00:49:15,489
[SPEAKER_17]: So there was no circumvention of anything.

639
00:49:16,209 --> 00:49:18,870
[SPEAKER_17]: The funds from the Remote Learning Technology Essentials Grant

640
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:36,907
[SPEAKER_17]: were used to purchase Chrome tablets for younger students and assistive technology, such as larger screen Chromebooks, iPads, headsets, and other various technology pieces of equipment for students to meet the needs of students with special needs in the remote and hybrid learning situations.

641
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:39,907
[SPEAKER_17]: This equipment has not yet been received.

642
00:49:41,088 --> 00:49:47,289
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a delay in grant notification, a delay in the award set up by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education,

643
00:49:48,581 --> 00:50:01,026
[SPEAKER_17]: And we are seeing significant delays in the delivery of devices and resources by vendors and manufacturers as the supply chain has been substantially disrupted by COVID.

644
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:07,528
[SPEAKER_16]: Could the funds have been used to improve the Wi-Fi at our schools, especially Medford High School?

645
00:50:08,629 --> 00:50:14,231
[SPEAKER_17]: So we are actually using $150,000 and that'll be discussed later on this evening, actually.

646
00:50:15,632 --> 00:50:19,094
[SPEAKER_16]: Number five, could the funds have been used to improve the remote learning academy?

647
00:50:20,835 --> 00:50:40,628
[SPEAKER_17]: So the CVRF, specifically the school reopening grant program, funded teacher devices, internet improvement, Google Enterprise to upgrade the learning environment options, additional nursing per diem, and filtering for school devices outside of school buildings.

648
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,871
[SPEAKER_17]: CARES Act funding provided student Chromebook devices

649
00:50:46,098 --> 00:50:56,125
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, of which we've received a thousand of the 1800 reordered, uh, K to 12 content library resources for remote hybrid learning Lexia for assessing learning gaps.

650
00:50:57,106 --> 00:51:01,809
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, we have purchased a substantial amount of internet hotspots for our students.

651
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:09,294
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I think we're in the neighborhood of 165 now, but, uh, that is a potential ad lib there.

652
00:51:09,354 --> 00:51:12,396
[SPEAKER_17]: So I apologize, but it is just, uh, we have purchased them.

653
00:51:13,001 --> 00:51:20,727
[SPEAKER_17]: And we continue to seek them to increase the internet capacity for students home and remote learning capacity.

654
00:51:20,987 --> 00:51:25,390
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're using multiple sources of funding for that.

655
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:29,473
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, that was the end of that email.

656
00:51:31,094 --> 00:51:32,395
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have one more email.

657
00:51:32,896 --> 00:51:38,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, did we answer the first question that Dave was gonna look at the email on?

658
00:51:39,151 --> 00:51:46,037
[SPEAKER_15]: I just forwarded to Mr. Rousseau responses to all five questions, but is the first question the exact cost of the laptops?

659
00:51:47,638 --> 00:51:48,479
[SPEAKER_08]: And accessories?

660
00:51:48,959 --> 00:51:49,280
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

661
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:49,560
[SPEAKER_15]: $1,159 apiece.

662
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:50,501
[SPEAKER_15]: And we purchased 520 of them.

663
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:51,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

664
00:51:53,283 --> 00:51:54,744
[SPEAKER_15]: And the next question is,

665
00:52:08,082 --> 00:52:13,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, my name is Latisha Rocha from Mystic Valley Parkway.

666
00:52:14,223 --> 00:52:19,684
[SPEAKER_16]: I have the following question regarding the next steps in the hybrid plan for school committee members or administrators who know the answer.

667
00:52:19,944 --> 00:52:25,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Vocational students are starting in-person classes and other high school students are meant to follow.

668
00:52:25,785 --> 00:52:28,906
[SPEAKER_16]: What has been done to address transportation needs for high school students?

669
00:52:29,226 --> 00:52:32,826
[SPEAKER_16]: A lot of low income students rely on the MBTA to get to school.

670
00:52:33,186 --> 00:52:37,207
[SPEAKER_16]: The MBTA cannot enforce mask wearing or social distancing measures.

671
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:46,877
[SPEAKER_16]: So how is that this glaring safety threat being addressed by the school administration, especially as community transmission in Medford and beyond increases exponentially?

672
00:52:47,077 --> 00:52:47,437
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

673
00:52:49,018 --> 00:53:07,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I think the only thing I could say in response to that Mr. Rousseau would be that we are and we will continue to communicate to all members of the student body, including high school students who will be relying on public transportation and frankly,

674
00:53:08,332 --> 00:53:18,435
[SPEAKER_15]: just based on their age, interfacing with the community in ways that younger students probably aren't as frequently on a continuous basis.

675
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:22,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Because all of you have heard Ms.

676
00:53:22,136 --> 00:53:28,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Ray's seven steps to live by in the midst of the pandemic.

677
00:53:28,698 --> 00:53:35,019
[SPEAKER_15]: And continuing to circulate that information and being as vigilant as possible is to some degree

678
00:53:39,743 --> 00:54:01,057
[SPEAKER_15]: the most insulation that the district can provide to students who are going to be, whether it be while availing themselves of transportation services or interacting in experiential learning environments or just living life, are going to face potential exposure.

679
00:54:01,117 --> 00:54:06,621
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's something that we're highly cognizant of and something we're very vigilant about.

680
00:54:07,842 --> 00:54:14,847
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think in terms of MBTA enforcement, there is a limitation as to what the district can do.

681
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:17,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Cushing, I don't know if you want to add to that.

682
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:24,413
[SPEAKER_17]: So the only thing that I would say to the email is at MBTA.com forward slash COVID-19.

683
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:33,839
[SPEAKER_17]: The first bullet point is all riders and employees are required to wear face coverings while riding the T. Not doing so may result in fines or removal.

684
00:54:35,326 --> 00:54:38,808
[SPEAKER_17]: from fine issue, sorry, fine issued by the transit police.

685
00:54:40,209 --> 00:54:47,673
[SPEAKER_17]: So our buses in the morning, I've been told only carry students in speaking to the MBTA supervisor.

686
00:54:48,513 --> 00:54:51,135
[SPEAKER_17]: They are doing enhanced disinfecting and cleaning.

687
00:54:51,335 --> 00:54:56,758
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've also been told that our buses, the first run they do is for our high school students.

688
00:54:57,978 --> 00:55:00,520
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know,

689
00:55:01,444 --> 00:55:18,391
[SPEAKER_17]: As Mr. Murphy was saying, there's limits to what we can do for our high school students on the MBTA, but we ask them to continue to be vigilant and continue to wear their masks as best they can at all times when unable to be physically distanced.

690
00:55:22,613 --> 00:55:23,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

691
00:55:25,914 --> 00:55:28,195
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up, we have number seven, report of superintendent

692
00:55:30,152 --> 00:55:31,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Superintendent's updates and comments.

693
00:55:32,094 --> 00:55:33,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Dr. Maurice Edwards-Edmondson.

694
00:55:34,996 --> 00:55:35,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

695
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:47,847
[SPEAKER_03]: My remarks today will be a little lengthier because there are a lot of topics that I need to just update the committee on.

696
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:50,449
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to preface it.

697
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:52,771
[SPEAKER_03]: So good evening.

698
00:55:53,031 --> 00:55:59,176
[SPEAKER_03]: The Medford Public Schools objective, first and foremost, is to educate our children.

699
00:55:59,876 --> 00:56:02,377
[SPEAKER_03]: safely and equitably.

700
00:56:04,098 --> 00:56:09,641
[SPEAKER_03]: To say it has not been an easy task during a pandemic is definitely an understatement.

701
00:56:11,762 --> 00:56:17,305
[SPEAKER_03]: But Medford has shouldered on keeping our students and families front and center.

702
00:56:18,065 --> 00:56:24,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It has not been perfect, but this is a playbook none of us ever anticipated.

703
00:56:25,489 --> 00:56:28,170
[SPEAKER_03]: It has taken many, many long hours of planning,

704
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:34,436
[SPEAKER_03]: community and school committee meetings, discussions with teachers, administrators and staff.

705
00:56:35,377 --> 00:56:42,721
[SPEAKER_03]: We have brought engineers into all of the buildings to gauge the air quality and commence repairs and upgrades where needed.

706
00:56:43,682 --> 00:56:46,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing has been done haphazardly or recklessly.

707
00:56:48,024 --> 00:56:54,308
[SPEAKER_03]: We have planned every move and remained as flexible as possible as our context has evolved.

708
00:56:56,002 --> 00:57:06,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Our families requested the option of all remote learning and hybrid in-school learning, and we prioritized the family choice throughout our reopening process.

709
00:57:08,128 --> 00:57:19,474
[SPEAKER_03]: To that end, we have made significant investments in webcams, microphones, and MacBooks so that teachers could teach effectively, whether remote or live.

710
00:57:21,135 --> 00:57:24,417
[SPEAKER_03]: We have done all of this to improve outcomes for all students.

711
00:57:26,101 --> 00:57:33,906
[SPEAKER_03]: It is my strong belief that bringing students back into our schools is critical for their academic health and social welfare.

712
00:57:35,267 --> 00:57:44,893
[SPEAKER_03]: The American Academy of Pediatrics, along with Medford's Board of Health and our own Health Services Department, support the return to in-person learning.

713
00:57:45,954 --> 00:57:50,097
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say again, our utmost priority is the safety for all.

714
00:57:51,653 --> 00:58:00,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Our students would never have been brought back without the approval of the medical professionals and listening to what the metrics are telling us.

715
00:58:01,638 --> 00:58:15,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Currently, we have over 1,700 students in our schools on the hybrid plan, with 1,260 students receiving remote instruction.

716
00:58:16,965 --> 00:58:20,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Our schools often function as safety nets for many of our students.

717
00:58:22,487 --> 00:58:31,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Our schools provide two meals a day, ensure that pupils receive their medication at the proper time and with the proper dosage.

718
00:58:32,609 --> 00:58:37,450
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are able to keep an eye on the students' physical and mental health.

719
00:58:38,791 --> 00:58:47,252
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, at all of our schools, we're offering grab-and-go sites that are providing lunch for families that are remote.

720
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:49,773
[SPEAKER_03]: At the McGlynn Complex,

721
00:58:51,093 --> 00:58:54,714
[SPEAKER_03]: On average, it's 15 meals a week.

722
00:58:57,895 --> 00:59:02,657
[SPEAKER_03]: At the high school complex, it's 25 meals a week, and the Curtis Tufts.

723
00:59:04,117 --> 00:59:07,779
[SPEAKER_03]: At the Roberts Elementary, it's approximately 95 meals a week.

724
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:11,780
[SPEAKER_03]: At the Brooks Elementary, 25 meals.

725
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:16,382
[SPEAKER_03]: At the Andrews Middle School, 100 meals a week.

726
00:59:17,562 --> 00:59:20,023
[SPEAKER_03]: At the Columbus Elementary School, 35 meals a week.

727
00:59:23,732 --> 00:59:32,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And please take note that when we say meals, when students or families are picking up the meals, it's actually two meals, so you can double those numbers.

728
00:59:32,576 --> 00:59:34,716
[SPEAKER_03]: They're picking up breakfast and lunch.

729
00:59:37,538 --> 00:59:48,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I can say to you that today it was a pleasure to once again be out in the field to see smiles and excitement from both our returning eighth graders, students, and our teachers.

730
00:59:49,848 --> 00:59:57,455
[SPEAKER_03]: As humans, we crave social interaction and we will take it even with masks and staying six feet apart.

731
00:59:58,656 --> 01:00:10,066
[SPEAKER_03]: With this addition, Medford now has K through eight in school two days a week and 300 of our most vulnerable students in school four days a week.

732
01:00:14,629 --> 01:00:17,472
[SPEAKER_03]: As I mentioned last week,

733
01:00:20,032 --> 01:00:28,715
[SPEAKER_03]: We are continuing to focus our efforts on removing barriers for reopening the high school to in-person learning as soon as possible.

734
01:00:30,036 --> 01:00:36,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I am optimistic about welcoming our high school students in a staggered capacity over the upcoming weeks.

735
01:00:38,558 --> 01:00:45,261
[SPEAKER_03]: This Thursday, November 19th, we plan to begin welcoming a small portion of our vocational students

736
01:00:46,205 --> 01:00:52,270
[SPEAKER_03]: both 11th and 12th graders back for a modified schedule of in-person hands-on instruction.

737
01:00:53,872 --> 01:01:02,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Phase one will welcome six of our 15 programs to in-person learning at the high school and select field-based learning opportunities.

738
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:14,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Those programs are cosmetology, culinary, arts, media, technology, health assisting, carpentry,

739
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:16,180
[SPEAKER_03]: and electrical.

740
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:26,565
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an exciting learning opportunity for our students, and we are grateful that our students will have this wonderful exposure to authentic learning in the field.

741
01:01:28,566 --> 01:01:36,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I have also shared that we have encountered some challenges with staffing and coverage as we continue to bring more students into our buildings.

742
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:50,284
[SPEAKER_03]: We continue to need additional support for our classroom supervisory positions, lunch recess coverage, and other non-instructional duties at all of our schools.

743
01:01:51,144 --> 01:02:00,187
[SPEAKER_03]: We are seeking adults who actually enjoy working with students to come join our team and support our hybrid model a few days a week.

744
01:02:01,903 --> 01:02:12,449
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's anyone listening tonight and you think you're interested, please contact our human resources department, or you can go on the website and complete the form.

745
01:02:13,569 --> 01:02:23,674
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that last Friday, when I did the mini commercial, we only had eight people who had signed up as of Friday to

746
01:02:24,997 --> 01:02:27,158
[SPEAKER_03]: support us in the supervisory roles.

747
01:02:27,759 --> 01:02:38,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pleased to announce that right now we are up to 20 individuals who have taken on the challenge and said they're willing to come join and be part of Team Mustang.

748
01:02:39,126 --> 01:02:45,910
[SPEAKER_03]: We were hoping for 25, but we do need significantly more volunteers who are willing to work

749
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,974
[SPEAKER_03]: at the secondary level as well.

750
01:02:49,835 --> 01:02:57,728
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, we have 20 individuals who have signed up and we are asking for more if possible.

751
01:02:58,319 --> 01:03:07,202
[SPEAKER_03]: so that we will be able to ensure coverage, whether it's reverse remote or for non-instructional supervisory roles.

752
01:03:07,803 --> 01:03:18,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're on the fence and you're not sure, you can also call our human resources and they will explain what those responsibilities will be in greater detail.

753
01:03:18,847 --> 01:03:22,408
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do wanna thank all of you who have signed up thus far.

754
01:03:24,161 --> 01:03:35,011
[SPEAKER_03]: As we continue to bring back more students for in-person learning opportunities, we do recognize that COVID numbers are rising across the state.

755
01:03:36,092 --> 01:03:43,078
[SPEAKER_03]: While numbers are on the rise in the community, schools in general have seen very little spread.

756
01:03:44,601 --> 01:03:54,507
[SPEAKER_03]: This context of the low spread in schools has been critical in our planning of providing more opportunities for in-person learning of our students.

757
01:03:56,728 --> 01:03:59,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Please be advised that we can't do this alone.

758
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:12,677
[SPEAKER_03]: The community at large must work with us and continue to wear masks, not congregate in large groups, sanitize hands and remember social distancing.

759
01:04:14,925 --> 01:04:27,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Please remember that a high number of other communities that surround us are only able to offer remote learning opportunities to their students due to the high rate of transmission of the virus.

760
01:04:29,496 --> 01:04:41,345
[SPEAKER_03]: So in partnership with our teachers, we feel we are giving parents, families, and students options to access education in the best way they see fit.

761
01:04:42,505 --> 01:04:46,669
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's remotely or hybrid within the Medford public schools.

762
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:50,974
[SPEAKER_03]: However, we must remain vigilant.

763
01:04:53,076 --> 01:04:59,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the event of a possible school closure, this decision would be made collaboratively.

764
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:04,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Our highest priority is the safety of all our students and staff.

765
01:05:05,553 --> 01:05:15,397
[SPEAKER_03]: So a recommendation for school closure would be made in collaboration with the Board of Health and pertinent data regarding our community in Medford.

766
01:05:16,278 --> 01:05:22,220
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee would also be kept abreast of any changes and deeply involved in the process.

767
01:05:22,981 --> 01:05:34,466
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an unprecedented time, and the collective voice of school administration, the Board of Health, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Medford School Committee,

768
01:05:35,068 --> 01:05:39,070
[SPEAKER_03]: we are all committed to prioritizing the safety of all.

769
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:50,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And if this decision needed to happen, we would use all media platforms to fully inform the school community and the community at large.

770
01:05:52,315 --> 01:06:01,279
[SPEAKER_03]: To that point, beginning in December, we are hoping for December 1st, the Medford Public Schools

771
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:09,568
[SPEAKER_03]: will begin to individually COVID test students to gather some baseline data.

772
01:06:10,748 --> 01:06:16,949
[SPEAKER_03]: We are in the process of working with our principals and administrators to coordinate the testing.

773
01:06:18,229 --> 01:06:29,952
[SPEAKER_03]: We appreciate the extensive work that has been done by nurse Toni Wray, our director of health services, along with all of our nursing staff,

774
01:06:30,803 --> 01:06:44,547
[SPEAKER_03]: the City of Medford, Tufts University, the Broad Institute, Armstrong Ambulance, Mary Ann O'Connor, everyone working collaboratively to try to provide this service.

775
01:06:45,907 --> 01:06:56,450
[SPEAKER_03]: More detailed information will be sent to families in the near future, but please keep that in mind that Medford Public Schools, we want to keep not only

776
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,718
[SPEAKER_03]: staff and teachers safe.

777
01:07:00,858 --> 01:07:02,779
[SPEAKER_03]: We want the students to be safe as well.

778
01:07:03,399 --> 01:07:08,801
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are hoping that this is something that we will continue to do, and we will keep you informed of that.

779
01:07:10,822 --> 01:07:18,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Following my remarks today, you're going to receive a more detailed public health update from Marianne O'Connor and Toni Wray.

780
01:07:20,845 --> 01:07:26,127
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to find out information today, later, about connectivity in our school buildings,

781
01:07:27,064 --> 01:07:38,934
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be a report on instructional innovations, as well as contingency plans for our most vulnerable students, and a remote academy update report.

782
01:07:40,696 --> 01:07:48,763
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these reports will show how the Medford Public Schools continues to move forward in this most unprecedented time.

783
01:07:51,390 --> 01:07:56,134
[SPEAKER_03]: For the community, again, I've mentioned it before, but I'm going to say it again.

784
01:07:56,874 --> 01:08:10,044
[SPEAKER_03]: The City of Medford, the Malden YMCA, and the Medford Public Schools, we are providing free grab-and-go meals for all kids ages 18 and under.

785
01:08:11,805 --> 01:08:20,532
[SPEAKER_03]: So kids or students do not need to attend the Medford Public Schools, and primary guardians do not need to be present to obtain the meals.

786
01:08:21,523 --> 01:08:27,025
[SPEAKER_03]: This program is going to continue throughout the school year, Monday to Friday, with breakfast and lunch.

787
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:30,065
[SPEAKER_03]: So this schedule is as follows.

788
01:08:30,946 --> 01:08:40,588
[SPEAKER_03]: YMCA offers meals at Haynes Square, 1145-1, the Tufts Park Pool, 1145-1, Medford's Recreational Center, 1145-1, and the Willis Ave Apartments, 1130-1.

789
01:08:52,728 --> 01:09:04,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford schools, the McGlynn, Complex, Columbus, Roberts, Andrews, and Brooks, all of those schools offer meals from 11 a.m.

790
01:09:04,433 --> 01:09:05,673
[SPEAKER_03]: to 12.30 p.m.

791
01:09:05,993 --> 01:09:08,374
[SPEAKER_03]: every day, Monday to Friday.

792
01:09:09,575 --> 01:09:15,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford High School offers lunch and breakfast pickup from 10.30 a.m.

793
01:09:15,237 --> 01:09:16,958
[SPEAKER_03]: until noon every day.

794
01:09:18,837 --> 01:09:22,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, I know some of the school committee members mentioned this before.

795
01:09:23,499 --> 01:09:35,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Brooke Hoyt of the Board of Health told me today that they were in the process of putting together a group of volunteers to deliver meals to approximately 20 families.

796
01:09:36,564 --> 01:09:43,007
[SPEAKER_03]: A number of our teachers have already signed up with her to assist, and I want to thank them in advance.

797
01:09:44,967 --> 01:09:55,318
[SPEAKER_03]: The West Medford Community Center is also collaborating with the Neighborhood Kitchen Restaurant to provide up to 200 free meals to low-income Medford residents.

798
01:09:56,920 --> 01:10:01,445
[SPEAKER_03]: These meals will be distributed at the West Medford Community Center on Monday, November 23, from 5 to 7 p.m.

799
01:10:07,984 --> 01:10:21,409
[SPEAKER_03]: People will need to sign up to receive their plate either online or by calling the West Medford Community Center at 781-483-3042, and they will add you to the list.

800
01:10:22,269 --> 01:10:25,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Plates will be available for pickup at the community center.

801
01:10:26,871 --> 01:10:30,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Special arrangements will be made for anyone requesting delivery.

802
01:10:33,742 --> 01:10:39,245
[SPEAKER_03]: I have also included in your school committee packets, the virtual Fells Day flyer.

803
01:10:40,085 --> 01:10:44,827
[SPEAKER_03]: This year, virtual Fells Day is taking place on Wednesday, November 18th.

804
01:10:45,468 --> 01:10:48,309
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wanna take this opportunity to thank Ms.

805
01:10:48,489 --> 01:10:53,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Ivy Carnabucci of our science faculty for arranging this opportunity.

806
01:10:56,733 --> 01:10:59,935
[SPEAKER_03]: A former Mustang is doing wonderful things in the community.

807
01:11:01,688 --> 01:11:19,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Our former student, Mr. Justin Tseng, currently a junior at Harvard University and the chair of the Harvard Public Opinion Project, recently wrote a commentary for WBUR entitled, The 2020 Youthquake is Coming.

808
01:11:20,878 --> 01:11:27,482
[SPEAKER_03]: In the piece, Justin discussed the importance of increasing numbers of young people, ages 18 to 29 to vote,

809
01:11:30,408 --> 01:11:37,949
[SPEAKER_03]: In his article, Justin spoke about having serious discussions about racial justice and the COVID response with his friends.

810
01:11:38,949 --> 01:11:44,910
[SPEAKER_03]: He found that a lot of friends were anxious about their futures, and that is why they plan to vote.

811
01:11:46,171 --> 01:11:49,951
[SPEAKER_03]: We are so proud of Justin for continuing his leadership role in college.

812
01:11:51,231 --> 01:11:53,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Once a Mustang, always a Mustang.

813
01:11:55,272 --> 01:11:59,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, our World Language Club, they are selling

814
01:12:00,472 --> 01:12:04,276
[SPEAKER_03]: face masks with flags as a fundraiser.

815
01:12:05,577 --> 01:12:13,505
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're interested in one mask, it's $3, two masks it's $5, and five masks for $13.

816
01:12:14,967 --> 01:12:15,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

817
01:12:15,167 --> 01:12:17,930
[SPEAKER_03]: Bobo is leading it up and you can reach out to her.

818
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:20,472
[SPEAKER_03]: She's leading the World Language Club.

819
01:12:22,414 --> 01:12:23,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, due to COVID,

820
01:12:25,248 --> 01:12:38,459
[SPEAKER_03]: We believe that this is going to be the first time since 1889 that there will not be a Thanksgiving football game versus Malden on Thanksgiving day.

821
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:41,622
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really something to think about.

822
01:12:42,562 --> 01:12:51,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford and Malden have played each other since 1889, and due to COVID, this is the first year that it's not gonna be able to happen.

823
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:54,152
[SPEAKER_03]: But we will pick it up again next year.

824
01:12:56,437 --> 01:13:01,903
[SPEAKER_03]: So speaking of Thanksgiving, the school schedule for the week of Thanksgiving will be as follows.

825
01:13:03,424 --> 01:13:09,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Monday and Tuesday will be regular days, but Wednesday, November 25th is our all remote day.

826
01:13:10,672 --> 01:13:12,014
[SPEAKER_03]: And it usually is a half day.

827
01:13:13,227 --> 01:13:17,689
[SPEAKER_03]: November 26th is Thanksgiving, and Friday, November 27th is off.

828
01:13:18,489 --> 01:13:24,272
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, next week, instruction will take place on Monday and Tuesday.

829
01:13:24,972 --> 01:13:29,815
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday is our half day, and Thursday and Friday, we have off for the holiday.

830
01:13:31,515 --> 01:13:37,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Please be advised, again, that there will be no in-school or remote learning on those days.

831
01:13:37,878 --> 01:13:38,979
[SPEAKER_03]: Please enjoy the holiday.

832
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:58,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, and this is very important, for those families who may be traveling to see family and friends over Thanksgiving, please think about the governor's guidance of not being in groups larger than 10 inside.

833
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:03,311
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for everyone's safety, health, and wellbeing.

834
01:14:04,812 --> 01:14:07,493
[SPEAKER_03]: But if for some reason you are required to travel,

835
01:14:09,613 --> 01:14:21,077
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking you as parents on the honor system, if you do travel, when you come back, please take your child for free COVID test.

836
01:14:22,097 --> 01:14:24,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Free COVID testing is available.

837
01:14:25,518 --> 01:14:38,483
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go to the state's website and look up mass.gov forward slash stop the spread and find a location that's close to you where you can take your child for

838
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:43,502
[SPEAKER_03]: free testing before you return your child to school.

839
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:46,923
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for the health and safety of everyone involved.

840
01:14:50,665 --> 01:14:55,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say, and what would Thanksgiving be without a Thanksgiving poem?

841
01:14:57,527 --> 01:14:58,827
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is my last piece.

842
01:15:00,248 --> 01:15:04,529
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to share a poem with you from a wonderful Medford resident who's no longer with us.

843
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:07,724
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a famous author.

844
01:15:08,364 --> 01:15:10,845
[SPEAKER_03]: Her name is Lydia Maria Child.

845
01:15:11,806 --> 01:15:16,228
[SPEAKER_03]: She was born in Medford on February 11th, 1802.

846
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:27,554
[SPEAKER_03]: She is best known for the famous poem, Over the River and Through the Wood, which most people think is a Christmas poem.

847
01:15:29,315 --> 01:15:35,278
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual name of the poem is the New England boys song about Thanksgiving day.

848
01:15:37,208 --> 01:15:37,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

849
01:15:37,528 --> 01:15:47,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Child was an ardent abolitionist, prolific writer, and is ranked among the most influential women of the 19th century.

850
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:56,213
[SPEAKER_03]: She wrote the first comprehensive history of both American slavery and the history of women.

851
01:15:57,454 --> 01:15:59,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Her Thanksgiving Day poem was written in 1845.

852
01:16:03,175 --> 01:16:19,822
[SPEAKER_03]: and gained its lasting popularity in 1874, when her friend, the Quaker abolitionist poet, John Greenleaf Whittier, included it in Child Life, an anthology of poetry for children.

853
01:16:20,882 --> 01:16:25,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Eventually, the poem was set to a tune by some unknown person.

854
01:16:26,884 --> 01:16:31,046
[SPEAKER_03]: The more modern song version is now considered a Christmas classic.

855
01:16:32,342 --> 01:16:35,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to share the poem with you now.

856
01:16:37,424 --> 01:16:41,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the river and through the wood, to grandfather's house we go.

857
01:16:42,626 --> 01:16:48,068
[SPEAKER_03]: The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh through the white and drifted snow.

858
01:16:49,329 --> 01:16:53,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the river and through the wood, oh how the wind does blow.

859
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:59,813
[SPEAKER_03]: It stings the toes and bites the nose as over the ground we go.

860
01:17:01,322 --> 01:17:05,604
[SPEAKER_03]: over the river and through the wood to have a first-rate play.

861
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:12,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Hear the bells ring, ting-a-ling-ding, hurrah for Thanksgiving Day.

862
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:18,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the river and through the wood, trot fast my dapple gray.

863
01:17:19,432 --> 01:17:24,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Spring over the ground like a hunting hound for this is Thanksgiving Day.

864
01:17:26,276 --> 01:17:28,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the river and through the wood,

865
01:17:29,252 --> 01:17:31,133
[SPEAKER_03]: and straight through the barnyard gate.

866
01:17:32,274 --> 01:17:34,956
[SPEAKER_03]: We seem to go extremely slow.

867
01:17:34,976 --> 01:17:37,617
[SPEAKER_03]: It is so hard to wait.

868
01:17:39,379 --> 01:17:44,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Over the river and through the wood, now grandma's cap I spy.

869
01:17:45,262 --> 01:17:46,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Hurrah for the fun.

870
01:17:47,584 --> 01:17:49,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the pudding done?

871
01:17:52,087 --> 01:18:00,971
[SPEAKER_03]: With that said, I would like to take this opportunity to wish each and every one of you a safe, blessed, and socially distanced Thanksgiving.

872
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:04,812
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't celebrate the holiday, enjoy the time off.

873
01:18:05,532 --> 01:18:08,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Be well, stay safe, and wear your mask.

874
01:18:09,394 --> 01:18:09,814
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

875
01:18:10,895 --> 01:18:12,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

876
01:18:16,717 --> 01:18:18,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin and Member Ruseau?

877
01:18:19,998 --> 01:18:20,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

878
01:18:22,003 --> 01:18:24,666
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent, and happy Thanksgiving to you.

879
01:18:25,847 --> 01:18:27,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for the poem, appreciate it.

880
01:18:28,009 --> 01:18:28,850
[SPEAKER_08]: Two questions I had.

881
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:34,295
[SPEAKER_08]: One was, I really appreciated you sharing Justin Singh's article.

882
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:34,755
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really...

883
01:18:36,192 --> 01:18:37,332
[SPEAKER_08]: well-written, I enjoyed it.

884
01:18:37,912 --> 01:18:39,313
[SPEAKER_08]: And it made me miss Justin.

885
01:18:39,513 --> 01:18:44,554
[SPEAKER_08]: And it also brought to mind the question of a student rep for our school committee.

886
01:18:44,614 --> 01:18:47,834
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm wondering what happened to our student rep for school committee.

887
01:18:47,854 --> 01:18:54,816
[SPEAKER_08]: If somebody knows or if we can, you know, re-engage or something, that would be really great.

888
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I think it's an important role.

889
01:18:58,496 --> 01:19:05,958
[SPEAKER_03]: I will definitely be able to follow up with Mr. DeLeva and have our student reps online for our next meeting.

890
01:19:07,225 --> 01:19:08,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, that would be great.

891
01:19:09,528 --> 01:19:18,963
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, you know, I understand from the last message you were saying, you're hoping to get more information to seniors, is that right, by the end of this week?

892
01:19:20,258 --> 01:19:26,439
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're expecting another report, as you know, reports, but we are expecting another report.

893
01:19:26,499 --> 01:19:30,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Significant progress is being made on the high school.

894
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are very optimistic.

895
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:43,703
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a good amount of rooms that are now online and we are working with some of the restrooms and a few other critical areas that also need to be online.

896
01:19:44,283 --> 01:19:47,844
[SPEAKER_03]: But we know next week is an abbreviated week.

897
01:19:48,645 --> 01:19:50,092
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm hoping for.

898
01:19:51,272 --> 01:20:06,560
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly some good news on November 30th, right after Thanksgiving, or very, very close, if not the 30th, maybe by the 3rd of December, to possibly have another cohort of students coming in at the high school level.

899
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:17,686
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are making significant progress and I'm equally excited, I have to say, about the 20 individuals who have signed up to join Team Mustang and

900
01:20:19,307 --> 01:20:28,389
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we know that a significant number will need to be at the high school where it is, you know, so much larger to have that supervision to support the reverse remote.

901
01:20:29,849 --> 01:20:48,874
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the one piece that, you know, between now and then we get enough people on board, we should be able to make it work provided, you know, all of these other areas that originally were not online, you know, I know CAF2 is back online.

902
01:20:49,414 --> 01:20:59,783
[SPEAKER_03]: So good progress is being made so that as we have larger numbers of kids come into the buildings, we'll be able to continue with a staggered hybrid, starting with that.

903
01:21:00,444 --> 01:21:00,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

904
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:02,206
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking forward to that.

905
01:21:03,046 --> 01:21:03,847
[SPEAKER_08]: To that good news.

906
01:21:05,008 --> 01:21:14,611
[SPEAKER_08]: And also wanted to say thank you for the food distribution and for specifically for, you know, working to help address those who are unable to come get the food.

907
01:21:14,651 --> 01:21:22,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I was really glad to hear that Brooke and the city are working together to make sure that our families are getting the meal.

908
01:21:22,594 --> 01:21:23,854
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much.

909
01:21:28,636 --> 01:21:29,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

910
01:21:30,577 --> 01:21:30,917
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

911
01:21:33,177 --> 01:21:34,497
[SPEAKER_16]: That was a lot, as it always is.

912
01:21:35,238 --> 01:21:35,978
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a lot to cover.

913
01:21:37,598 --> 01:21:45,420
[SPEAKER_16]: The number of meals being served, those numbers were, well, frankly, quite depressing.

914
01:21:47,321 --> 01:21:56,204
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, are we even talking 1% or a 10th of a percent of meals typically served?

915
01:21:57,404 --> 01:22:00,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to be able to present a more robust

916
01:22:03,659 --> 01:22:04,920
[SPEAKER_03]: more robust meal numbers.

917
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:28,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I know with the other locations that I listed, I don't have the other locations numbers to try to figure out, is it possible that a significant number of our families are going to Haines Square in some of the non-school based places that they're getting meals?

918
01:22:28,474 --> 01:22:29,954
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually would like to,

919
01:22:33,109 --> 01:22:57,176
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to present at an upcoming meeting what our numbers are, especially as we have more students coming in, of who's accessing the grab-and-go breakfast and lunch, and see if there's a way to figure out who's accessing the grab-and-go lunch at the other city locations, so that that could explain the discrepancy in some of the numbers there.

920
01:22:58,356 --> 01:22:58,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

921
01:22:58,877 --> 01:22:59,957
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that would be great to hear.

922
01:23:00,933 --> 01:23:06,597
[SPEAKER_16]: We have on our later on in our agenda, we are certainly gonna be talking about hunger and the snap gaps.

923
01:23:06,637 --> 01:23:12,662
[SPEAKER_16]: So those numbers were kind of hard to hear, frankly.

924
01:23:12,682 --> 01:23:16,165
[SPEAKER_16]: 15, it's a tiny little number.

925
01:23:17,506 --> 01:23:23,911
[SPEAKER_16]: 15 is probably served in like the first three minutes of school every day in a normal school year.

926
01:23:25,712 --> 01:23:29,155
[SPEAKER_16]: My other question was around, actually we have an update coming up on the,

927
01:23:30,225 --> 01:23:30,885
[SPEAKER_16]: public health stuff.

928
01:23:30,905 --> 01:23:31,946
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'll wait on my other question.

929
01:23:32,006 --> 01:23:32,326
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

930
01:23:34,607 --> 01:23:34,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

931
01:23:36,849 --> 01:23:41,431
[SPEAKER_10]: We have number two COVID-19 public health update and testing update report.

932
01:23:41,451 --> 01:23:41,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

933
01:23:41,631 --> 01:23:42,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Toni Wray.

934
01:23:44,032 --> 01:23:44,953
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everyone.

935
01:23:45,593 --> 01:23:52,857
[SPEAKER_11]: Mary Ann O'Connor is not available to be with us tonight, so I will share a few bits of information that she passed on.

936
01:23:54,525 --> 01:24:00,066
[SPEAKER_11]: Currently Medford is in the yellow zone averaging 21 positive cases a day.

937
01:24:00,706 --> 01:24:04,627
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the highest rate since last May or early June.

938
01:24:05,847 --> 01:24:10,948
[SPEAKER_11]: Our positivity rate is 0.96% and 50% of the cases are in young adults between 20 and 39.

939
01:24:20,974 --> 01:24:32,080
[SPEAKER_11]: The health metrics were changed last week by Governor Baker and now are based on the size of the municipality and also incorporates the positivity rate.

940
01:24:32,520 --> 01:24:38,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Cities must stay below a 4% positivity rate to maintain students in school.

941
01:24:41,316 --> 01:25:00,811
[SPEAKER_11]: For school-related data, the staff surveillance testing, since the end of September, we have tested over 2,500 staff members, meaning we've done 2,500 tests and have only yielded three positive tests to date.

942
01:25:01,871 --> 01:25:03,032
[SPEAKER_11]: That is very encouraging.

943
01:25:04,813 --> 01:25:09,977
[SPEAKER_11]: For student COVID activity in school, between November 1st and November 15th,

944
01:25:12,533 --> 01:25:18,076
[SPEAKER_11]: Nine students tested positive after community or family exposure.

945
01:25:19,376 --> 01:25:22,138
[SPEAKER_11]: Six students are remote learning students.

946
01:25:22,558 --> 01:25:23,938
[SPEAKER_11]: Three students are hybrid.

947
01:25:25,639 --> 01:25:33,602
[SPEAKER_11]: There were nine students that were determined to be close contacts from those positive cases and are being quarantined.

948
01:25:34,643 --> 01:25:36,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Four of those nine students are siblings.

949
01:25:37,668 --> 01:25:40,370
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is a family exposure.

950
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:46,594
[SPEAKER_11]: The remaining five were from community contact and not from in-school transmission.

951
01:25:48,795 --> 01:25:57,701
[SPEAKER_11]: School nurses are presently monitoring 38 students for community and family exposure, which are unrelated to the nine positive school cases.

952
01:25:59,942 --> 01:26:03,284
[SPEAKER_11]: Staff COVID activity between November 1st and November 15th.

953
01:26:04,928 --> 01:26:09,291
[SPEAKER_11]: There were three positive cases that were determined to be from community exposure.

954
01:26:09,311 --> 01:26:19,196
[SPEAKER_11]: 10 staff were quarantined as a result of one in-school exposure, all tested negative after the exposure.

955
01:26:20,657 --> 01:26:25,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Eight staff members are currently being monitored because of community and family exposure.

956
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:31,764
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have one staff member who was quarantined after a possible in-school exposure.

957
01:26:34,196 --> 01:26:40,450
[SPEAKER_11]: I've received some emails regarding questions with questions and confusion about what defines an infectious period.

958
01:26:41,793 --> 01:26:43,437
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'll address that tonight.

959
01:26:44,355 --> 01:26:56,224
[SPEAKER_11]: An infectious period pertains to disease positive person and is defined as a period of time when the person is capable of directly or indirectly transmitting infectious material.

960
01:26:57,084 --> 01:27:08,933
[SPEAKER_11]: For COVID illness, this is defined as two days prior to the onset of symptoms or two days prior to the date of a positive test, and it continues for 10 days forward.

961
01:27:10,264 --> 01:27:21,330
[SPEAKER_11]: It differs from incubation period, which is defined as the time between the day when one is infected or exposed with the virus and the day that the symptoms begin.

962
01:27:22,091 --> 01:27:27,694
[SPEAKER_11]: For COVID illness, this is defined as 14 days past the date of exposure.

963
01:27:30,396 --> 01:27:38,080
[SPEAKER_11]: I hope this is helpful as we try to explain quarantine and isolation dates to families and staff members.

964
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:40,931
[SPEAKER_10]: It is, thank you, Ms.

965
01:27:40,971 --> 01:27:41,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Rae.

966
01:27:41,211 --> 01:27:42,952
[SPEAKER_10]: A member so.

967
01:27:43,032 --> 01:27:43,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

968
01:27:44,854 --> 01:27:45,214
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

969
01:27:47,035 --> 01:27:49,377
[SPEAKER_16]: The minus two days, thank you for your report.

970
01:27:49,878 --> 01:27:52,960
[SPEAKER_16]: I know you're working round the clock, literally seven days a week.

971
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:58,845
[SPEAKER_16]: So I do greatly appreciate how exhausting this is for everyone in your profession.

972
01:28:01,927 --> 01:28:05,129
[SPEAKER_16]: The minus two days though, confuses me.

973
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:08,072
[SPEAKER_16]: If I contract COVID today,

974
01:28:09,077 --> 01:28:13,099
[SPEAKER_16]: and I get a, let's say two days from now, I go get a test and I'm positive.

975
01:28:13,839 --> 01:28:15,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Minus two days makes sense.

976
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:21,503
[SPEAKER_16]: If I wait 10 days and go get a test, minus two days no longer makes any sense.

977
01:28:22,484 --> 01:28:24,024
[SPEAKER_16]: So where does the minus two days come from?

978
01:28:25,325 --> 01:28:27,186
[SPEAKER_11]: That's epidemiology practice.

979
01:28:28,086 --> 01:28:31,708
[SPEAKER_11]: And your two days can be your prior to any onset of symptoms.

980
01:28:34,032 --> 01:28:39,234
[SPEAKER_11]: In the absence of symptoms, they define it as two days prior to the positive test.

981
01:28:41,475 --> 01:28:48,859
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just the principles that we follow and that the Board of Health follows from the Department of Public Health Division of Epidemiology.

982
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,821
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish I could explain it better, Paul.

983
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:58,243
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd have to have one of the epidemiologists on here to give you that specific information.

984
01:29:01,026 --> 01:29:02,447
[SPEAKER_16]: It just fails basic logic.

985
01:29:02,567 --> 01:29:05,730
[SPEAKER_16]: So regardless of who says it, it fails basic logic.

986
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:10,773
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I mean, I will accept that that's the current recommendations.

987
01:29:11,734 --> 01:29:13,955
[SPEAKER_16]: And if that's the current recommendations, that's what they are.

988
01:29:14,055 --> 01:29:20,460
[SPEAKER_16]: And I recognize that when there's a huge number of unknowns, you have to set up something to work with.

989
01:29:22,301 --> 01:29:26,724
[SPEAKER_16]: But it also is hard to not acknowledge that it is illogical.

990
01:29:27,245 --> 01:29:30,147
[SPEAKER_16]: It is 100% illogical for an asymptomatic person

991
01:29:30,803 --> 01:29:38,709
[SPEAKER_16]: who test positive, if they took a test every day, then maybe you could come to some kind of like two days make sense, but nobody takes a test every day.

992
01:29:38,849 --> 01:29:51,278
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, this working back two days and then if somebody was interacting with that person three days ago, they don't get contact traced.

993
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:57,643
[SPEAKER_16]: I just find that to be a pretty massive gaping hole you could drive a truck through.

994
01:29:58,618 --> 01:30:03,301
[SPEAKER_16]: especially for asymptomatic people when frankly there's so little known about them even today.

995
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:08,105
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just, I don't even know where to go on that.

996
01:30:10,286 --> 01:30:15,150
[SPEAKER_11]: I can give you names of people at DPH if you'd like to pass that forward to them.

997
01:30:17,091 --> 01:30:18,892
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I went to the CDC website.

998
01:30:18,932 --> 01:30:21,574
[SPEAKER_16]: There was nothing that mentioned this two days backwards.

999
01:30:22,414 --> 01:30:26,097
[SPEAKER_16]: And as much as I want to trust our state, frankly, I don't.

1000
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:31,747
[SPEAKER_16]: They've given us plenty of evidence that trust of them right now is pretty weak.

1001
01:30:32,888 --> 01:30:37,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Giving trust to them requires evidence and they've given us the opposite of that.

1002
01:30:37,429 --> 01:30:51,533
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, the CDC, while I realize it's presently politically slanted right now, there's nothing I could find on this two days back thing.

1003
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:55,514
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, you know, in my emails I did say,

1004
01:30:56,045 --> 01:30:56,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Can I get a reference?

1005
01:30:57,446 --> 01:30:59,447
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I work in a healthcare organization.

1006
01:30:59,847 --> 01:31:10,412
[SPEAKER_16]: When somebody publishes something, there's a laundry list of references to the studies, or even, you know, when there aren't studies yet, but you have to make an action, there's an explanation.

1007
01:31:10,992 --> 01:31:16,935
[SPEAKER_16]: The two days back, I don't know where that's coming from, and I would like to know other than somebody told me.

1008
01:31:18,987 --> 01:31:25,130
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've been following the two days since, since March, including with the schools since September 28th.

1009
01:31:25,190 --> 01:31:32,834
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's been very effective with regards to no school transmission, except I think one case, if I have that correct, but.

1010
01:31:34,555 --> 01:31:39,738
[SPEAKER_11]: I can refer you to this website, www.cdc.gov.

1011
01:31:40,698 --> 01:31:46,501
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you, there's a PDF on contact tracing and it will explain that,

1012
01:31:49,725 --> 01:32:03,151
[SPEAKER_11]: Contact defined as any individual who is within six feet of an infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more, starting from 48 hours before the person began feeling sick until the time the patient is isolated four days later.

1013
01:32:03,171 --> 01:32:05,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I did find that.

1014
01:32:06,193 --> 01:32:11,215
[SPEAKER_16]: And the CDC seems to be completely mum on the topic of asymptomatic patients.

1015
01:32:12,135 --> 01:32:15,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Just searching for the words asymptomatic was pretty hard to find anything interesting.

1016
01:32:17,478 --> 01:32:18,198
[SPEAKER_11]: We are learning.

1017
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:39,213
[SPEAKER_11]: This last eight months has been a tremendous learning phase, and we are trying to hold our students and our staff to the utmost mitigation strategies, and we are following everything that has been recommended to us as guidance from the Mass.

1018
01:32:39,253 --> 01:32:40,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Department of Public Health.

1019
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:49,300
[SPEAKER_11]: And in the absence of any other information, this is what best practice tells us to do.

1020
01:32:54,303 --> 01:32:54,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1021
01:32:55,364 --> 01:32:56,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1022
01:32:57,966 --> 01:33:05,671
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, David Murphy can introduce some points from the upcoming student surveillance testing program.

1023
01:33:06,752 --> 01:33:07,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1024
01:33:08,113 --> 01:33:08,994
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks, Toni.

1025
01:33:09,054 --> 01:33:09,394
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1026
01:33:09,921 --> 01:33:12,421
[SPEAKER_15]: The superintendent referenced this in her comments earlier.

1027
01:33:12,441 --> 01:33:16,562
[SPEAKER_15]: It was also included in the superintendent's communication at the end of the last week.

1028
01:33:17,142 --> 01:33:32,445
[SPEAKER_15]: We are intending to transition from exclusively staff COVID-19 testing, which we have been facilitating in partnership with Tufts, the Broad Institute and Armstrong Ambulance since the end of September.

1029
01:33:33,225 --> 01:33:35,886
[SPEAKER_15]: And we'll continue to do so through the end of this month.

1030
01:33:36,826 --> 01:33:37,586
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is our

1031
01:33:38,165 --> 01:33:44,868
[SPEAKER_15]: working plan right now to transition to student and staff testing in the first week of December.

1032
01:33:46,709 --> 01:34:03,836
[SPEAKER_15]: There are several variables that we still need to finalize in order to operationalize this and make sure that it happens and make sure that it happens in a way that is feasible and does not disproportionately disrupt the instructional day.

1033
01:34:04,675 --> 01:34:16,361
[SPEAKER_15]: two things that are important priorities for us, both with regard to this initial phase of student testing and any additional student testing that occurs in calendar year 2021.

1034
01:34:17,681 --> 01:34:26,145
[SPEAKER_15]: So as of right now, we intend over the course of the next week to communicate with families and disseminate appropriate consent forms.

1035
01:34:27,286 --> 01:34:29,807
[SPEAKER_15]: And then within each school community,

1036
01:34:30,578 --> 01:34:35,360
[SPEAKER_15]: to run student testing such that each student is tested once a week.

1037
01:34:36,100 --> 01:34:50,727
[SPEAKER_15]: And so students in cohort A would be tested most likely once a week, and then students in cohort B and C would be tested on either Tuesday or Friday, respectively, depending on the individual cohort.

1038
01:34:52,595 --> 01:34:54,456
[SPEAKER_15]: That's our current plan.

1039
01:34:54,596 --> 01:34:58,896
[SPEAKER_15]: We hope to do three weeks of individual baseline testing throughout the month of December.

1040
01:35:00,077 --> 01:35:08,979
[SPEAKER_15]: We're continuing to meet with the folks from Tufts to sort of determine how this is actually gonna be put into practice.

1041
01:35:10,159 --> 01:35:20,421
[SPEAKER_15]: And as I said, there are a number of details that we still need to work out, but our priority is to do it in a way that is efficient from a financial perspective, and then importantly, does not serve to disrupt

1042
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:22,039
[SPEAKER_15]: the instructional day.

1043
01:35:22,539 --> 01:35:39,350
[SPEAKER_15]: Our hope is that by modeling this throughout the month of December, we'll be in a position to be able to do additional student testing of a slightly different type that we'll be speaking to you about in greater detail in December when students return in the new year.

1044
01:35:39,470 --> 01:35:41,191
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's our plan right now.

1045
01:35:41,231 --> 01:35:44,613
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be communicating with families extensively over the coming days.

1046
01:35:45,234 --> 01:35:50,257
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is something that staff and families should be prepared for.

1047
01:35:51,098 --> 01:35:55,022
[SPEAKER_15]: because there will be a difference in terms of the administration of the testing.

1048
01:35:55,042 --> 01:35:59,866
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be rather than having it a centralized location, it'll be happening throughout each individual school.

1049
01:36:00,767 --> 01:36:13,478
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, we're in the process of determining exactly what that will look like at each school and at each level, taking into account, again, the need to not be too disruptive to the school day.

1050
01:36:16,180 --> 01:36:17,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1051
01:36:17,081 --> 01:36:18,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Ruseau.

1052
01:36:21,254 --> 01:36:21,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1053
01:36:21,955 --> 01:36:40,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess as I'm thinking about the student testing, I'm thinking about, you know, my own child with a developmental disability and, you know, her responsiveness to testing and even frankly, myself, you know, I've had, I guess, five different tests now at this point.

1054
01:36:41,771 --> 01:36:44,673
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've only done one, the original one was the, you know,

1055
01:36:46,374 --> 01:37:05,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what else to call it, but was the really long sort of brain probe, if you will, which was particularly painful, uncomfortable, you know, not pleasant at all, and has progressively, you know, gotten better in terms of, you know, also because I make it really clear that I'm not doing that one again.

1056
01:37:06,630 --> 01:37:14,256
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, to the superintendent's point when she was talking earlier about the stop the spread sites, I do want to say, you know,

1057
01:37:14,776 --> 01:37:28,621
[SPEAKER_08]: several members of my family have been to the Suffolk Downs Stop the Spread site, and I can tell you from a personal experience, that is a site where it's a very non-invasive, if you will, nasal swab that you administer yourself.

1058
01:37:30,002 --> 01:37:33,543
[SPEAKER_08]: They give you the Q-tip or what have you, and then you hand it back.

1059
01:37:33,603 --> 01:37:38,525
[SPEAKER_08]: So it was probably of all the experiences, it was the most reasonable.

1060
01:37:38,885 --> 01:37:40,566
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm thinking about this for our

1061
01:37:41,446 --> 01:38:00,783
[SPEAKER_08]: is, you know, for all of our children, our younger children, but also, you know, cohort A in terms of, you know, their ability, I guess, or, you know, my concern around the presentation of the testing and ensuring that the testing is the

1062
01:38:03,222 --> 01:38:10,524
[SPEAKER_08]: the, I guess, least non-invasive one, particularly for children who might not be that willing in the first place, so.

1063
01:38:10,824 --> 01:38:25,129
[SPEAKER_15]: It is definitely the lesser invasive one, and that will be the case for all students where part of the looking at how we're going to operationalize this is determining whether older students will be trained to self-swap.

1064
01:38:26,189 --> 01:38:29,850
[SPEAKER_15]: That's an issue that we're looking at, and we're looking to see what's age appropriate.

1065
01:38:30,333 --> 01:38:34,877
[SPEAKER_15]: and obviously making sure that there's appropriate staffing support for all students, particularly those of higher needs.

1066
01:38:35,598 --> 01:38:39,741
[SPEAKER_15]: But regardless, the type of test will not be the one that goes way up there.

1067
01:38:40,662 --> 01:38:41,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, and Ms.

1068
01:38:41,302 --> 01:38:41,482
[SPEAKER_11]: Ray.

1069
01:38:41,623 --> 01:38:41,863
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1070
01:38:42,681 --> 01:39:05,870
[SPEAKER_11]: I did want to add, Melanie, that I've had conversations with Susanna Campbell, and she is going to develop some social stories that can be used with our students with disabilities so that they will be introduced to the process and will know what to expect during student testing.

1071
01:39:06,350 --> 01:39:07,131
[SPEAKER_08]: That's fantastic.

1072
01:39:07,171 --> 01:39:16,101
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess I would just say, you know, to Joan and Susanna and yourself, that I would not limit those social stories to students with disabilities.

1073
01:39:16,141 --> 01:39:18,704
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, those really apply to our younger kids as well.

1074
01:39:19,144 --> 01:39:20,045
[SPEAKER_08]: They're very visual.

1075
01:39:20,105 --> 01:39:21,107
[SPEAKER_08]: They're very supportive.

1076
01:39:21,147 --> 01:39:22,408
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a nice introduction.

1077
01:39:23,229 --> 01:39:26,613
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would really encourage, you know, our general education team and our

1078
01:39:27,413 --> 01:39:42,156
[SPEAKER_08]: non-disabled families to get access to those social stories as well, because there's lots of them that Susanna has compiled a great database of, from what is COVID, to wearing a mask, to getting testing, all those things.

1079
01:39:42,196 --> 01:39:50,698
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would really encourage folks to let Joan Bowen know or let Susanna Campbell know if you're particularly interested in any of those social stories.

1080
01:39:50,718 --> 01:39:52,938
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a nice bank of them that have been building.

1081
01:39:53,018 --> 01:39:54,159
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you, Tony.

1082
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:55,479
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1083
01:39:56,895 --> 01:40:02,177
[SPEAKER_10]: In relation to discuss the rapid test site, I'm sorry, excuse me.

1084
01:40:03,578 --> 01:40:19,185
[SPEAKER_10]: To discuss how easy it is to sign up for testing at the Revere, stop the spread site, you go on mass.gov, under express COVID-19 testing site in Revere, it takes about five minutes.

1085
01:40:19,365 --> 01:40:23,327
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just signed my family up for scheduled appointments this Saturday.

1086
01:40:23,367 --> 01:40:25,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's a way to get your children if you do have

1087
01:40:26,485 --> 01:40:29,466
[SPEAKER_10]: transportation to get your Children there to just kind of get used to it.

1088
01:40:29,586 --> 01:40:31,066
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not invasive as well.

1089
01:40:31,146 --> 01:40:35,828
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to bring that up as an option for families that are able to get to a stop.

1090
01:40:36,788 --> 01:40:37,708
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great idea, Mayor.

1091
01:40:37,748 --> 01:40:39,829
[SPEAKER_08]: And also you get the results back within.

1092
01:40:39,889 --> 01:40:42,350
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we were under, you know, even 12 hours.

1093
01:40:42,410 --> 01:40:44,350
[SPEAKER_08]: It was crazy how fast we got the results back.

1094
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:45,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1095
01:40:46,011 --> 01:40:46,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

1096
01:40:48,111 --> 01:40:48,491
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1097
01:40:48,571 --> 01:40:50,732
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I actually used to stop the spread site and, uh,

1098
01:40:52,492 --> 01:40:53,293
[SPEAKER_16]: don't go on Sundays.

1099
01:40:54,614 --> 01:40:57,035
[SPEAKER_16]: Most of them are closed, except a couple on Sunday.

1100
01:40:57,115 --> 01:40:59,957
[SPEAKER_16]: And when people want to go on a Sunday, they go on a Sunday.

1101
01:41:01,078 --> 01:41:02,079
[SPEAKER_16]: The lines were shocking.

1102
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,441
[SPEAKER_16]: But the site was free and quick.

1103
01:41:07,583 --> 01:41:09,784
[SPEAKER_16]: But I had a question about policy.

1104
01:41:11,538 --> 01:41:13,800
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm wondering if we need to have an emergency meeting.

1105
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:27,051
[SPEAKER_16]: We have an approved policy that is on our website that says that when the metrics are eight cases are over in Medford per 100,000 residents, that we will be full remote for all students.

1106
01:41:28,332 --> 01:41:36,579
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't believe that is what we want based on the latest information, but it is in fact the current policy and I don't wanna

1107
01:41:37,318 --> 01:41:41,900
[SPEAKER_16]: be a bit of a jerk, but in a previous meeting was kind of thrown in my face.

1108
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:44,840
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't want policy that the superintendent violates.

1109
01:41:44,941 --> 01:41:47,541
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a bad scene, a bad setup.

1110
01:41:48,142 --> 01:41:54,244
[SPEAKER_16]: And we at present have a policy approved by this committee that everybody should be full remote right now.

1111
01:41:54,404 --> 01:42:04,547
[SPEAKER_16]: So either we go full remote tomorrow or we have a meeting to fix this, because I don't think operating under a violation of the policy is the goal of our reopening dashboard.

1112
01:42:07,900 --> 01:42:24,567
[SPEAKER_16]: So I make a motion that we have a meeting within the next week to adjust these metrics to take into account the governor's newfangled definition of what he personally thinks is important so that we can at least not be in violation of our own policy.

1113
01:42:24,587 --> 01:42:27,088
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor?

1114
01:42:27,649 --> 01:42:29,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, Mr. Murphy.

1115
01:42:29,650 --> 01:42:34,992
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't, this is obviously completely up to the committee, so I apologize in advance if I'm speaking out of turn,

1116
01:42:35,578 --> 01:42:37,919
[SPEAKER_15]: This topic is on tonight's agenda.

1117
01:42:37,959 --> 01:42:55,429
[SPEAKER_15]: And so if the issue is you'd like to essentially suspend or modify the metric in the sense that that's an approved policy by the committee, I think you do have that option.

1118
01:42:56,870 --> 01:43:04,495
[SPEAKER_15]: COVID-19 and the operation of our protocols is a publicly noticed agenda item.

1119
01:43:05,991 --> 01:43:07,512
[SPEAKER_15]: Your discussion is appropriate.

1120
01:43:07,532 --> 01:43:19,637
[SPEAKER_15]: And while I know it's the committee's practice, and I think a very sound one, that try to have the wording of a motion on the agenda itself, the legal requirement is that the topic be noticed, which it has been.

1121
01:43:19,657 --> 01:43:34,524
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I think you would be potentially in a better position from an open meeting perspective to vote on this issue that you publicly noticed, as opposed to roll the dice on whether or not the issue would warrant an emergency meeting.

1122
01:43:34,968 --> 01:43:36,989
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm just putting that out there as an option.

1123
01:43:37,469 --> 01:43:38,009
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I agree.

1124
01:43:38,329 --> 01:43:38,609
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

1125
01:43:38,649 --> 01:43:50,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if we put a motion under 7-2 to not adhere to the metrics prior that we prior voted on prior, that would be sufficient.

1126
01:43:51,254 --> 01:43:51,474
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor.

1127
01:43:52,374 --> 01:43:52,874
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

1128
01:43:53,495 --> 01:43:53,755
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1129
01:43:56,996 --> 01:44:01,178
[SPEAKER_16]: I honestly cannot imagine that there are not a significant number of parents.

1130
01:44:01,859 --> 01:44:10,163
[SPEAKER_16]: I would be shocked if the unions were not interested in the fact that we were gonna go to a situation where we had no metrics for operating our schools in a pandemic.

1131
01:44:10,723 --> 01:44:23,410
[SPEAKER_16]: I did not actually agree with the metrics, but I think going to a no metrics seems a bit extreme, frankly.

1132
01:44:24,846 --> 01:44:36,394
[SPEAKER_16]: And I can't imagine we will not have our flooded inboxes and some angry union presidents who are like, we've been operating under these metrics that you published and said, and we were okay with that.

1133
01:44:37,095 --> 01:44:43,099
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just think going to no metrics right now seems pretty risky.

1134
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:45,181
[SPEAKER_16]: That's just my opinion.

1135
01:44:46,188 --> 01:44:47,649
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we'd be going to know metrics.

1136
01:44:47,689 --> 01:44:55,812
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the state's new metrics, which say if we go 4% or above with positivity rate, that we'd have to go to remote learning.

1137
01:44:57,073 --> 01:44:57,993
[SPEAKER_10]: No questions asked.

1138
01:44:58,253 --> 01:45:03,556
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's the metrics the state's using, and that's what I think we should follow.

1139
01:45:03,576 --> 01:45:08,778
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if my colleagues have.

1140
01:45:09,918 --> 01:45:11,799
[SPEAKER_07]: What's our current positivity rate? 0.96%.

1141
01:45:14,891 --> 01:45:21,995
[SPEAKER_07]: And how does Tufts multi times a week testing factoring into that positivity rate?

1142
01:45:22,195 --> 01:45:27,918
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like it would be inflating the low number or deflating the number.

1143
01:45:32,221 --> 01:45:41,426
[SPEAKER_10]: They're doing, I don't have the correct number on the top of my head, but they are going to continue through twice a week, each student.

1144
01:45:42,827 --> 01:45:43,067
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1145
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:49,042
[SPEAKER_07]: So our positivity numbers are garbage.

1146
01:45:49,542 --> 01:45:49,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1147
01:45:49,982 --> 01:45:52,803
[SPEAKER_07]: They're heavily weighted to Tufts.

1148
01:45:54,484 --> 01:45:54,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are they?

1149
01:45:56,304 --> 01:45:58,205
[SPEAKER_07]: How many tests are happening?

1150
01:46:00,206 --> 01:46:03,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Two per student, but most they're- But I mean in Medford in general.

1151
01:46:04,127 --> 01:46:05,648
[SPEAKER_07]: And what percentage of it is Tufts?

1152
01:46:06,308 --> 01:46:10,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Tufts is asking students that leave on Thanksgiving break not to come back.

1153
01:46:10,389 --> 01:46:11,490
[SPEAKER_10]: So the testing is gonna,

1154
01:46:13,387 --> 01:46:23,349
[SPEAKER_10]: be reduced after Thanksgiving and further reduced after Christmas, which will potentially increase our positivity rate.

1155
01:46:23,369 --> 01:46:24,850
[SPEAKER_10]: If we were going.

1156
01:46:27,790 --> 01:46:33,852
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm not in favor of hanging our hat on a number that is problematic at best, but that's just me.

1157
01:46:35,072 --> 01:46:37,073
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to weigh in that.

1158
01:46:39,668 --> 01:46:49,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Thus far, the transmission has been, it has really, really been limited at the school level.

1159
01:46:49,392 --> 01:46:54,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we have, again, like I said, about 1,700 kids in school now.

1160
01:46:55,454 --> 01:46:58,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the amount of kids that are in school, it is happening.

1161
01:46:58,135 --> 01:46:59,456
[SPEAKER_03]: We know the virus exists.

1162
01:47:00,056 --> 01:47:04,898
[SPEAKER_03]: But the major transmission is not happening in schools.

1163
01:47:05,518 --> 01:47:07,999
[SPEAKER_03]: It's happening in the community, or it's

1164
01:47:09,935 --> 01:47:10,915
[SPEAKER_03]: home transmission.

1165
01:47:11,616 --> 01:47:19,978
[SPEAKER_03]: So although we've been impacted, it hasn't impacted the schools to the point where the schools cannot function at this point in time.

1166
01:47:19,998 --> 01:47:30,481
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know that there are other communities that have significantly, significantly higher numbers and it's a different situation, but

1167
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:40,503
[SPEAKER_03]: at least as far as where we've been this far, starting with the eighth grade this week, we've actually been in pretty good shape.

1168
01:47:42,823 --> 01:47:43,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1169
01:47:43,664 --> 01:47:45,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Van der Kloot, Member Ruseau, Member Graham.

1170
01:47:46,285 --> 01:47:53,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just wanted to ask if you could repeat, how are we getting permission for the students to get tested?

1171
01:47:54,748 --> 01:47:56,848
[SPEAKER_06]: Will we have a blanket permission slip?

1172
01:47:56,868 --> 01:47:58,349
[SPEAKER_06]: Will we have one?

1173
01:47:58,389 --> 01:48:01,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you just go over those, that again, please?

1174
01:48:03,004 --> 01:48:11,092
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a blanket that Desi has provided.

1175
01:48:11,152 --> 01:48:17,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Desi provided a template for us that we could customize to Medford.

1176
01:48:17,519 --> 01:48:23,986
[SPEAKER_11]: It does provide parent consent for blanket testing over the course of the school year.

1177
01:48:25,775 --> 01:48:28,798
[SPEAKER_11]: We are working on getting that messaging out to families.

1178
01:48:28,878 --> 01:48:32,981
[SPEAKER_11]: The letter has to be translated, but our goal is to get it out as soon as possible.

1179
01:48:33,982 --> 01:48:35,123
[SPEAKER_06]: And if parents opt out?

1180
01:48:36,264 --> 01:48:50,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Then that is duly noted on the classroom roster so that when the testers are gathering students to swab, that we will have an accurate list of who has consent to be swabbed.

1181
01:48:51,356 --> 01:48:52,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will be confidential?

1182
01:48:54,605 --> 01:48:56,026
[SPEAKER_11]: The list?

1183
01:48:56,667 --> 01:49:02,192
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm just saying that the teacher will know who opts out and not.

1184
01:49:03,573 --> 01:49:09,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Only by default, because you won't be bringing those students to the testing room.

1185
01:49:10,498 --> 01:49:11,960
[SPEAKER_11]: This is very similar.

1186
01:49:11,980 --> 01:49:20,447
[SPEAKER_11]: The process becomes very similar to vision and hearing and scoliosis screening that the school nurses normally do.

1187
01:49:22,262 --> 01:49:25,183
[SPEAKER_11]: of which parents do have the right to opt out and some do.

1188
01:49:25,203 --> 01:49:26,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1189
01:49:27,283 --> 01:49:27,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1190
01:49:27,563 --> 01:49:30,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1191
01:49:31,944 --> 01:49:32,364
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1192
01:49:32,384 --> 01:49:36,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember Graham actually asked a question that I thank you.

1193
01:49:36,965 --> 01:49:43,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause I had not fully contemplated the impact of Tufts on our, our positivity rate.

1194
01:49:43,306 --> 01:49:46,887
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, unfortunately Tufts is not publishing.

1195
01:49:47,527 --> 01:49:50,448
[SPEAKER_16]: They have their Medford slash Somerville data.

1196
01:49:51,587 --> 01:49:55,368
[SPEAKER_16]: So we don't know, is it 50% Medford, 50% Somerville?

1197
01:49:55,749 --> 01:50:14,135
[SPEAKER_16]: But if we just took 50% of the students and said they were Medford, that is 3,000 tests a week at a positivity rate of only 0.26, which is a, I don't know how many tests are happening in Medford, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and bet the majority of tests that are happening in Medford are happening at Tufts.

1198
01:50:15,844 --> 01:50:22,887
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, is this dramatically waiting and bringing our positivity rate down to the point where it doesn't mean a thing?

1199
01:50:22,947 --> 01:50:26,468
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, could we, if we subtracted Tufts, are we at 4%?

1200
01:50:27,909 --> 01:50:29,109
[SPEAKER_16]: We can answer that question.

1201
01:50:29,549 --> 01:50:36,872
[SPEAKER_16]: What I mean is the Board of Health with actual numbers and like individuals can do the subtraction and get that answer.

1202
01:50:37,392 --> 01:50:45,295
[SPEAKER_16]: But I feel like it's a bit unfair to say we're at 0.97 when the bulk of the tests that are probably happening in Medford each week

1203
01:50:45,753 --> 01:50:51,795
[SPEAKER_16]: are happening to a cohort of people that are getting very low positivity rates.

1204
01:50:53,035 --> 01:50:57,396
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, 0.26% is, I mean, we could really be happy with that.

1205
01:50:58,377 --> 01:51:01,517
[SPEAKER_16]: So what is our positivity rate?

1206
01:51:01,617 --> 01:51:12,541
[SPEAKER_16]: And I mean, the DPH site doesn't tell us because it includes this institution that's doing a great thing by testing a lot.

1207
01:51:14,721 --> 01:51:22,383
[SPEAKER_16]: but it's created this weird situation where I have no reason to trust that positivity rate unless they truly are subtracting all those.

1208
01:51:22,783 --> 01:51:34,705
[SPEAKER_16]: And 0.97 is non-student residents, which honestly, the amount of work and the fact that they had to delay release of that data now after Thursdays, I can't imagine they're doing that level of detail.

1209
01:51:35,685 --> 01:51:40,886
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm uncomfortable with just rolling it back to do what the state says.

1210
01:51:41,427 --> 01:51:43,547
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we need real conversation with real data

1211
01:51:44,143 --> 01:51:50,585
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to know what is our positivity rate minus the flooded Tufts number?

1212
01:51:55,988 --> 01:52:00,189
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be in touch with Marianne O'Connor, and we'll have to get back to you about that.

1213
01:52:00,749 --> 01:52:03,430
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not something off the top of my head I can calculate out.

1214
01:52:06,672 --> 01:52:07,012
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1215
01:52:07,252 --> 01:52:07,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

1216
01:52:11,827 --> 01:52:23,691
[SPEAKER_07]: At every meeting, we get a verbal update with a bunch of numbers that get tossed our way, but those numbers don't ever get reported in formal fashion.

1217
01:52:24,471 --> 01:52:33,813
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a numbers person, but I'm not a numbers person who can just ingest numbers spoken at me and be able to like simultaneously interpret those and remember them.

1218
01:52:33,873 --> 01:52:36,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already forgotten what Tony said 15 minutes ago.

1219
01:52:36,314 --> 01:52:36,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we,

1220
01:52:40,641 --> 01:52:51,886
[SPEAKER_07]: When we talk about the metrics dashboard, we spent a tremendous amount of time putting that together so that at any point in time, anybody could go look at it and understand where we were at.

1221
01:52:52,006 --> 01:52:55,348
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have not kept up our end of the bargain from that perspective.

1222
01:52:55,848 --> 01:52:58,029
[SPEAKER_07]: We are not publishing that on a weekly basis.

1223
01:52:58,469 --> 01:53:00,651
[SPEAKER_07]: or not filling it out the way that we said that we would.

1224
01:53:00,671 --> 01:53:08,476
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we need to start to do that in addition to revisiting what we thought were the right metrics at the time.

1225
01:53:09,177 --> 01:53:14,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I will not vote for anything that just arbitrarily rolls back and puts

1226
01:53:16,261 --> 01:53:17,961
[SPEAKER_07]: this decision in the hands of a few.

1227
01:53:19,422 --> 01:53:29,564
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not where I'm at personally, but I would like to see us commit to actually publishing data to the community so people can make good decisions for their own family.

1228
01:53:30,144 --> 01:53:41,347
[SPEAKER_07]: It appears that we are taking the position that because we have provided options, everyone gets to sort of fend for themselves and make their own choices, which

1229
01:53:42,267 --> 01:53:46,029
[SPEAKER_07]: may be fine, that may be workable for lots of people.

1230
01:53:46,469 --> 01:53:52,292
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just want to point out, our numbers are as bad as they were in April when the instruction was don't leave your house.

1231
01:53:52,952 --> 01:53:59,095
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of a sudden, we're all out caring about our business, which is great.

1232
01:53:59,995 --> 01:54:04,717
[SPEAKER_07]: But our numbers aren't that different than when we weren't supposed to leave our homes.

1233
01:54:04,817 --> 01:54:08,479
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we're saying school is not transmitting things.

1234
01:54:09,399 --> 01:54:19,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Which again, if that's true, it's great, but I would like to be able to sit with the numbers and understand that for myself, which I can't do when it's just sort of spoken at us.

1235
01:54:20,713 --> 01:54:23,156
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to understand how complete the data set is.

1236
01:54:23,257 --> 01:54:26,881
[SPEAKER_07]: So at various times we hear that

1237
01:54:28,182 --> 01:54:31,403
[SPEAKER_07]: contact tracing is complicated because people are not cooperating.

1238
01:54:31,423 --> 01:54:36,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if people are not cooperating, how are we concluding that school-based transmission is not a thing?

1239
01:54:37,565 --> 01:54:51,670
[SPEAKER_07]: And then back to member Rousseau's point earlier tonight, like we don't know that somebody who's asymptomatic and test positive has only had the virus for two days, but yet we're using that and frankly providing instruction to people to not

1240
01:54:52,430 --> 01:54:58,818
[SPEAKER_07]: worry too much beyond two days when that may not be a good thing for our community spread anyway.

1241
01:55:00,220 --> 01:55:02,603
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just think this warrants a bigger conversation.

1242
01:55:02,623 --> 01:55:09,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say that I am, I think anyway based on what I can recall about the information that's been shared with us,

1243
01:55:10,072 --> 01:55:14,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm surprised that we haven't seen more spread than we have seen.

1244
01:55:14,657 --> 01:55:23,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's because we have welcomed our youngest learners who have the least amount of, I'll say free will about how they move about the community.

1245
01:55:24,347 --> 01:55:25,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's why.

1246
01:55:25,829 --> 01:55:27,851
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe when we welcome back some of our

1247
01:55:29,252 --> 01:55:37,539
[SPEAKER_07]: more mobile students who have freedoms to move about as they see fit that we will see something very different.

1248
01:55:38,379 --> 01:55:49,488
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think anybody, you know, and certainly not me, I don't want to see us have to close, but I want us to be clear about what it would look like if we did.

1249
01:55:50,368 --> 01:56:00,072
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't want that to feel like an arbitrary decision made by anybody because there shouldn't be anything arbitrary about how we make this decision.

1250
01:56:00,092 --> 01:56:10,275
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanna make sure that we're doing our due diligence as a committee, not putting this weight on the superintendent because that's not what we should be here to do.

1251
01:56:11,376 --> 01:56:13,337
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it should be a collaborative decision.

1252
01:56:13,377 --> 01:56:13,957
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do think

1253
01:56:14,817 --> 01:56:29,382
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to properly post that this is what we're going to talk about, because there are a number of members of the community who I believe are not here tonight that would want to speak about this, either to say to stick with what we have or to change it or to do something else completely.

1254
01:56:29,402 --> 01:56:35,545
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we owe the community that courtesy as we have this conversation so I would.

1255
01:56:36,955 --> 01:56:40,098
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Member Ruseau made a motion to schedule a meeting.

1256
01:56:40,118 --> 01:56:42,700
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have to be an emergency meeting.

1257
01:56:42,720 --> 01:56:44,862
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be no to 72 hours out.

1258
01:56:44,922 --> 01:56:45,823
[SPEAKER_07]: That's fine by me.

1259
01:56:46,244 --> 01:56:54,011
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do think we need to have a meeting where we revisit what we're publishing, how we're publishing it, and what those metrics are that are going to drive us forward.

1260
01:56:55,917 --> 01:56:59,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to say that the metrics have been updated.

1261
01:56:59,020 --> 01:57:02,082
[SPEAKER_03]: The only week that they were skipped, Ms.

1262
01:57:02,102 --> 01:57:05,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Suzy Weiss, my executive assistant, has been updating it.

1263
01:57:05,865 --> 01:57:11,790
[SPEAKER_03]: She added the state's definition, but there were no changes to Medford standards.

1264
01:57:14,052 --> 01:57:19,617
[SPEAKER_03]: It just was to reflect what the changes that the state did, which

1265
01:57:20,217 --> 01:57:24,279
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, impact where we would fall.

1266
01:57:24,959 --> 01:57:38,544
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to say that the metrics have been a exception of the week that the state changed the day that they were giving the information out.

1267
01:57:38,584 --> 01:57:40,585
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the only week where it did not change.

1268
01:57:41,645 --> 01:57:42,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information.

1269
01:57:46,927 --> 01:57:49,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Member Ruseau, then Member McLaughlin.

1270
01:57:50,181 --> 01:57:50,281
[SPEAKER_16]: you.

1271
01:57:50,301 --> 01:57:50,481
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1272
01:57:50,501 --> 01:57:51,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1273
01:57:51,121 --> 01:57:56,864
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, Maurice, if that pardon me, Superintendent, if that is true, I will say that I can't find it.

1274
01:57:56,964 --> 01:58:04,247
[SPEAKER_16]: And the only place I can find anything is a reference to the October 15th one, which says that it will happen every week, but I cannot find that.

1275
01:58:04,347 --> 01:58:08,328
[SPEAKER_16]: So if that's true, it would be great if you could tell us where it's published.

1276
01:58:10,589 --> 01:58:11,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm

1277
01:58:21,058 --> 01:58:34,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm feeling, you know, based on both constituent emails and the, you know, member Ruseau and member Graham's comments that I also think that a meeting would be

1278
01:58:36,417 --> 01:58:37,657
[SPEAKER_08]: helpful to the community.

1279
01:58:37,677 --> 01:58:53,823
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that with the metrics changing from the state level and with all of these unknowns, I mean, I'm going back again to my graduate level stats class and it's like, you can't compare apples to oranges and sort of, or change the data midway and sort of have these comparisons.

1280
01:58:54,663 --> 01:58:55,844
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it would be really helpful.

1281
01:58:56,004 --> 01:59:03,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also though concur with member Graham that I think we need notice.

1282
01:59:03,026 --> 01:59:04,427
[SPEAKER_08]: I think an emergency meeting

1283
01:59:06,007 --> 01:59:21,738
[SPEAKER_08]: with is probably not as essential as it is to have notice to the community that this is what the meeting would be discussing, especially as we're thinking about, I mean, we're seeing every time I turn on the news, it's more, you know, dread and danger and mayhem.

1284
01:59:21,798 --> 01:59:24,960
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's concerning as we're seeing the numbers rise.

1285
01:59:24,980 --> 01:59:32,244
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, if you do a comparison, minus the COVID fatigue to the spring, we were all inside at this point, we weren't interacting with each other.

1286
01:59:32,264 --> 01:59:34,326
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you're dealing with this COVID fatigue and people are

1287
01:59:34,906 --> 01:59:50,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Interacting more and more and to the point of, you know, this, we keep hearing this data that this is not happening in schools, or that the shares not happening in schools or exposures not happening in schools but there's these unknowns as Member Graham and Member Ruseau were discussing.

1288
01:59:51,017 --> 01:59:58,603
[SPEAKER_08]: both of people who aren't responding to the contact tracing and or there's 50% that we don't know about.

1289
01:59:58,623 --> 02:00:03,226
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that statistics put out there all the time, or there's 50% that we don't know how the contact tracing was.

1290
02:00:03,266 --> 02:00:05,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, 50% is a pretty large number.

1291
02:00:05,288 --> 02:00:06,488
[SPEAKER_08]: We have information.

1292
02:00:07,049 --> 02:00:08,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1293
02:00:08,250 --> 02:00:11,612
[SPEAKER_10]: In general, 50% is not associated with our schools.

1294
02:00:11,832 --> 02:00:14,895
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been able to contact trace every case within our schools.

1295
02:00:14,995 --> 02:00:16,055
[SPEAKER_10]: Tony can confirm that.

1296
02:00:16,095 --> 02:00:19,198
[SPEAKER_10]: We've had one school transmission since September 28th.

1297
02:00:20,057 --> 02:00:26,000
[SPEAKER_10]: So the 50% is just community-wide, what Mary Ann O'Connor is facing within the community at large.

1298
02:00:26,360 --> 02:00:28,381
[SPEAKER_10]: We do not have in-school transmission.

1299
02:00:28,921 --> 02:00:33,103
[SPEAKER_08]: So 50% that we don't know we don't have school transmission is what you're saying.

1300
02:00:33,123 --> 02:00:34,283
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we know if we don't know?

1301
02:00:34,403 --> 02:00:35,204
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the state.

1302
02:00:35,524 --> 02:00:37,045
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, Ms.

1303
02:00:37,345 --> 02:00:39,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Ray, if you could comment on that.

1304
02:00:39,426 --> 02:00:46,609
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been able to track every positive case and find out that it was from family transmission within the household.

1305
02:00:47,302 --> 02:00:49,843
[SPEAKER_10]: A parent comes home from work, passes it to the children.

1306
02:00:50,143 --> 02:00:51,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Children go in, find out they're positive.

1307
02:00:52,044 --> 02:00:56,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, nobody else in that class has got it, and we've been able to trace it back to the parents.

1308
02:00:56,387 --> 02:00:57,787
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been- That's 100%, not 50%.

1309
02:00:57,987 --> 02:00:59,688
[SPEAKER_10]: That's 100%.

1310
02:00:59,988 --> 02:01:02,550
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, that's- Point of information, point of information.

1311
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:05,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, member Ruseau.

1312
02:01:07,532 --> 02:01:08,933
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody else in that class has it.

1313
02:01:09,413 --> 02:01:12,995
[SPEAKER_16]: Unless you tested everybody in that class, how do we make a statement like that?

1314
02:01:17,323 --> 02:01:36,272
[SPEAKER_11]: anybody that was a close contact is notified and I would assume that we would get tested and we'd find out that's a very we are anybody identified as a close contact is advised to be tested at day four to five post exposure, which is a reliable time for receiving

1315
02:01:38,186 --> 02:01:39,147
[SPEAKER_11]: a positive test.

1316
02:01:40,208 --> 02:01:43,050
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are passing on that information.

1317
02:01:43,431 --> 02:01:46,433
[SPEAKER_11]: The nurses are following up with every student.

1318
02:01:46,793 --> 02:01:57,262
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, as I said, we have over 38 students that we are monitoring because of either a community or family exposure, and that has been unrelated to school cases.

1319
02:01:59,683 --> 02:02:21,370
[SPEAKER_11]: This information is reported out to DESE on a daily basis, and they have also been able to aggregate data across the state, and communities are finding similar experiences as Medford, that the overall transmission is happening at the community and family level.

1320
02:02:23,764 --> 02:02:24,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mayor.

1321
02:02:24,905 --> 02:02:28,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor, I'm sorry, but still could member McLaughlin has the floor.

1322
02:02:29,227 --> 02:02:30,427
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, member McLaughlin has the floor.

1323
02:02:30,447 --> 02:02:30,808
[SPEAKER_16]: You're right.

1324
02:02:32,729 --> 02:02:33,509
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll yield the floor.

1325
02:02:33,549 --> 02:02:33,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1326
02:02:34,910 --> 02:02:36,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1327
02:02:38,252 --> 02:02:46,316
[SPEAKER_16]: I personally know of a case in one of our elementary schools for which the source of that child being positive is completely unknown.

1328
02:02:46,816 --> 02:02:50,658
[SPEAKER_16]: So stating that we know that every one of the positives in the school

1329
02:02:51,186 --> 02:02:55,047
[SPEAKER_16]: has been from a known source outside of the school is not true.

1330
02:02:56,127 --> 02:03:02,449
[SPEAKER_16]: And I take great offense that that is actually the statement being offered up.

1331
02:03:02,729 --> 02:03:03,949
[SPEAKER_16]: It is not true.

1332
02:03:09,330 --> 02:03:12,691
[SPEAKER_10]: I try to follow up with every single case through Ms.

1333
02:03:12,751 --> 02:03:19,153
[SPEAKER_10]: O'Connor, and it's always traced back from what I've heard.

1334
02:03:19,253 --> 02:03:19,853
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know, Ms.

1335
02:03:19,873 --> 02:03:20,773
[SPEAKER_10]: Ray, if you've heard

1336
02:03:22,648 --> 02:03:24,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have anything additional to add.

1337
02:03:26,912 --> 02:03:36,821
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul, I really would like to hire you on my staff to do contact tracing, because it seems like you may have different skills.

1338
02:03:36,841 --> 02:03:41,766
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, the parents have been clear that they don't have any idea where the child got it.

1339
02:03:42,086 --> 02:03:45,569
[SPEAKER_16]: And the parents have been clear that nobody else in the family is positive.

1340
02:03:46,210 --> 02:03:47,631
[SPEAKER_16]: So the child was in school.

1341
02:03:49,104 --> 02:03:52,625
[SPEAKER_16]: This seems like an exact example of the opposite of what is being stated as 100%.

1342
02:03:53,046 --> 02:04:01,749
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm sorry, but that's, the community needs to know that that is a pretty interesting interpretation of what I think are pretty simple facts.

1343
02:04:02,790 --> 02:04:04,090
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor, can we move the question?

1344
02:04:04,110 --> 02:04:05,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Van der Kloot?

1345
02:04:10,317 --> 02:04:17,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just going to say that it seems, you know, Mr. Rousseau is presenting certain information that Tony's unaware of.

1346
02:04:17,338 --> 02:04:26,340
[SPEAKER_06]: And that needs to be a private conversation between the two of them if information wants to be shared so that she can verify it.

1347
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:32,481
[SPEAKER_06]: Because at this point, it's only, you know, working on hearsay, if you would.

1348
02:04:33,061 --> 02:04:34,901
[SPEAKER_16]: I have communicated that.

1349
02:04:36,342 --> 02:04:36,402
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1350
02:04:39,016 --> 02:04:43,219
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I just, I'm not privy to the details of it.

1351
02:04:44,059 --> 02:04:51,464
[SPEAKER_06]: None of us are, except perhaps the two of you, and somehow or another, it doesn't seem like it's really moving us ahead.

1352
02:04:53,145 --> 02:04:56,948
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like there's some will to have further discussion on this.

1353
02:04:57,308 --> 02:05:00,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a hard time because I know I'm not an expert.

1354
02:05:01,535 --> 02:05:08,137
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I'm a school committee member who has great intentions and wanna do the best for our kids, but I'm not an expert on this.

1355
02:05:08,637 --> 02:05:10,818
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that means that I have to listen to experts.

1356
02:05:11,578 --> 02:05:23,382
[SPEAKER_06]: And in some places I'm a little worried because I feel like some perhaps of my fellow school committee members think that they can interpret things in a better way than some of the experts.

1357
02:05:23,442 --> 02:05:24,643
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not,

1358
02:05:25,683 --> 02:05:27,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm feeling a little uncomfortable about this.

1359
02:05:28,125 --> 02:05:29,606
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we do need to move on.

1360
02:05:29,646 --> 02:05:37,352
[SPEAKER_06]: If we're going to have a meeting on it, where the potential would be maybe next Monday, if I threw out a date.

1361
02:05:38,773 --> 02:05:43,057
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the will of the entire committee is at this point about it.

1362
02:05:43,177 --> 02:05:45,078
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm definitely feeling uncertain.

1363
02:05:46,359 --> 02:05:49,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand arguments that I'm hearing, but

1364
02:05:51,102 --> 02:06:01,466
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what are the major question is, I've heard some things about metrics and looking into how Tufts changes us, our potential numbers.

1365
02:06:02,767 --> 02:06:09,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly, Mr. Rousseau is saying that the current policy that we have is not accurate and needs to be updated.

1366
02:06:10,909 --> 02:06:17,452
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, I heard the superintendent say something about that it was being updated

1367
02:06:18,552 --> 02:06:23,415
[SPEAKER_03]: What's posted, if you look at the actual metric, it says the week of November 13th.

1368
02:06:23,475 --> 02:06:30,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to the website at the top, it said October 15th, 2020, beginning today and every Thursday.

1369
02:06:31,060 --> 02:06:43,768
[SPEAKER_03]: That was when the header was posted, but the actual dashboard is for November 13th at the top, because it's looking at the previous three weeks of data.

1370
02:06:45,107 --> 02:07:00,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to say, if you scroll down from the October 15th header, when we switched the day and said we would be posting it on Thursdays, the actual document does say November 13th.

1371
02:07:01,662 --> 02:07:05,665
[SPEAKER_07]: A point of information, section three is not filled out and it never has been.

1372
02:07:06,286 --> 02:07:08,468
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's some,

1373
02:07:09,292 --> 02:07:14,598
[SPEAKER_07]: blanket language there, which is not the intent of what that section is supposed to contain.

1374
02:07:14,658 --> 02:07:16,320
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've brought this up multiple times.

1375
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:17,761
[SPEAKER_07]: It's never been populated.

1376
02:07:17,821 --> 02:07:23,828
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I say we're not even populating the things that we said we would do, that is what I'm specifically referring to.

1377
02:07:24,529 --> 02:07:30,996
[SPEAKER_07]: And so even if the metrics are updated as of last week, the dashboard is incomplete and it always has been.

1378
02:07:32,388 --> 02:07:37,212
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe the school committee agreed with what you were saying you wanted in section three.

1379
02:07:37,352 --> 02:07:42,255
[SPEAKER_03]: When you click on the hyperlink, it says the Medford Board of Health and Medford Public Schools.

1380
02:07:42,815 --> 02:07:48,839
[SPEAKER_03]: This document was what we worked on with the definitions with the frameworks group.

1381
02:07:49,079 --> 02:07:50,801
[SPEAKER_03]: We worked on this in collaboration.

1382
02:07:51,681 --> 02:08:00,608
[SPEAKER_03]: and we talked about the different scenarios so I'm not sure what else you're asking for but what is posted is what we agreed to when we met as a group.

1383
02:08:01,529 --> 02:08:02,089
[SPEAKER_03]: That I know.

1384
02:08:02,109 --> 02:08:11,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay we're going to move the question member McLaughlin.

1385
02:08:12,739 --> 02:08:13,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1386
02:08:13,139 --> 02:08:38,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just for the other members, I guess benefit and for those that are listening, I guess what I think is being asked is that we have a meeting to discuss under what circumstances we would end up being all remote again, given what we're seeing in metrics as a whole, not just in the city, but in the country and

1387
02:08:39,938 --> 02:08:40,538
[SPEAKER_08]: to have a meeting to discuss.

1388
02:08:40,558 --> 02:08:43,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Um as a state of affairs in general is that accurate?

1389
02:08:45,542 --> 02:08:49,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that what the motion was to have a meeting to discuss under what circumstances we would.

1390
02:08:50,566 --> 02:08:52,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Be going remote and what the no.

1391
02:08:53,408 --> 02:08:57,892
[SPEAKER_16]: No my motion was to have a meeting to develop a set of metrics that.

1392
02:09:06,817 --> 02:09:08,598
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like I'm a bit conservative in this approach.

1393
02:09:08,818 --> 02:09:11,658
[SPEAKER_16]: And even I agree that metrics we have, we don't want to keep.

1394
02:09:12,438 --> 02:09:12,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1395
02:09:12,699 --> 02:09:23,761
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think the metric that you were referring to when I heard what you were saying was specifically the metric of what happens, the 8 to 100,000 equals remote.

1396
02:09:23,821 --> 02:09:25,122
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that was where I was sort of

1397
02:09:31,251 --> 02:09:48,540
[SPEAKER_08]: My inclination is that we need to have a meeting to discuss under what circumstances we are going remote or if we were gonna go remote and what the implications of that would be so that we have that clear to the community under what those circumstances were.

1398
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:56,825
[SPEAKER_08]: Because as you said, member Ruseau, the metrics have changed both from a state perspective and not yet from a Medford perspective.

1399
02:09:56,905 --> 02:10:00,187
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess that would be inclusive of what you're discussing.

1400
02:10:01,555 --> 02:10:11,400
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I would just keep it short to say to update our metrics to meet the current guidance.

1401
02:10:13,701 --> 02:10:13,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1402
02:10:15,181 --> 02:10:15,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

1403
02:10:16,722 --> 02:10:24,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I don't really have a more specific, I didn't come to this meeting prepared to say, here's some new metrics, let's use these.

1404
02:10:25,346 --> 02:10:31,129
[SPEAKER_16]: That I felt should be a whole meeting with some time for us to get our heads in order and figure it out.

1405
02:10:35,272 --> 02:10:36,672
[SPEAKER_08]: May we move the question, Mayor?

1406
02:10:38,353 --> 02:10:52,356
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, if I just may, before the question is voted on, just for the record, I don't feel, I have no problem having meetings, many meetings.

1407
02:10:52,516 --> 02:10:56,938
[SPEAKER_10]: I just feel like the admin and Ms.

1408
02:10:56,998 --> 02:10:57,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Ray and Ms.

1409
02:10:57,618 --> 02:11:01,839
[SPEAKER_10]: O'Connor are doing such a great job, not only keeping us all informed, but

1410
02:11:03,618 --> 02:11:08,982
[SPEAKER_10]: work in each contact tracing situation as best they can.

1411
02:11:09,022 --> 02:11:14,626
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't feel like us having a meeting is necessary at this point.

1412
02:11:14,686 --> 02:11:18,308
[SPEAKER_10]: Will it be necessary in two weeks or three weeks if we see in-school transmission?

1413
02:11:18,429 --> 02:11:19,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

1414
02:11:19,609 --> 02:11:23,012
[SPEAKER_10]: But right now that's gonna, my vote is based on that.

1415
02:11:23,092 --> 02:11:32,979
[SPEAKER_10]: And I trust the administration and our board of health and head nurse of the schools to make these decisions, which I feel they're doing a really good job doing.

1416
02:11:33,635 --> 02:11:34,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Mayor.

1417
02:11:35,717 --> 02:11:45,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to add, it's not that I don't trust the administration, I very much do, and I very much appreciate all of the work that Toni Wray and Marianne O'Connor and all of our administration has been doing.

1418
02:11:47,247 --> 02:11:58,016
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm more interested in the fact that it's being communicated in advance to our families and our constituents in a way that everybody clearly understands, school committee included.

1419
02:11:58,176 --> 02:12:00,638
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not a matter of not trusting

1420
02:12:02,529 --> 02:12:08,553
[SPEAKER_08]: the superintendent or anyone else's decision making, because I do, implicitly.

1421
02:12:09,073 --> 02:12:14,237
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to make sure that we're all understanding what that actually means and under what circumstances.

1422
02:12:14,277 --> 02:12:17,259
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to make that point of clarification.

1423
02:12:17,319 --> 02:12:17,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1424
02:12:18,059 --> 02:12:18,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1425
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:19,761
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor.

1426
02:12:20,361 --> 02:12:20,921
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ruseau.

1427
02:12:21,662 --> 02:12:21,882
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1428
02:12:21,962 --> 02:12:24,384
[SPEAKER_16]: I also did want to confirm that this is not about trust.

1429
02:12:25,164 --> 02:12:26,145
[SPEAKER_16]: This is about policy.

1430
02:12:26,225 --> 02:12:30,728
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we don't do this, then the schools have to go full remote tomorrow, according to our policy.

1431
02:12:31,189 --> 02:12:34,472
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not an opinion, it's not the mayor has any more authority here.

1432
02:12:34,492 --> 02:12:40,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody in this room has authority to just keep the schools open in violation of our policy.

1433
02:12:40,197 --> 02:12:46,743
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we should get our policy in order so that the superintendent doesn't have to walk this very weird situation.

1434
02:12:46,763 --> 02:12:49,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we'll never get the right policy in place.

1435
02:12:49,385 --> 02:12:54,350
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a global pandemic that we're dealing with and situation's changing every minute.

1436
02:12:54,530 --> 02:12:56,612
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's my no vote.

1437
02:12:57,474 --> 02:13:00,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Move the question by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1438
02:13:01,037 --> 02:13:01,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call.

1439
02:13:02,098 --> 02:13:02,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

1440
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:03,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1441
02:13:05,180 --> 02:13:05,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Kreatz?

1442
02:13:08,543 --> 02:13:08,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1443
02:13:10,825 --> 02:13:11,685
[SPEAKER_06]: Member McLaughlin?

1444
02:13:12,426 --> 02:13:12,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1445
02:13:14,307 --> 02:13:15,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Mustone?

1446
02:13:16,569 --> 02:13:16,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1447
02:13:18,951 --> 02:13:19,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau?

1448
02:13:20,592 --> 02:13:20,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1449
02:13:22,514 --> 02:13:23,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Van der Kloot?

1450
02:13:23,335 --> 02:13:23,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1451
02:13:24,015 --> 02:13:24,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor?

1452
02:13:24,976 --> 02:13:25,276
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

1453
02:13:25,356 --> 02:13:26,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Six in the affirmative.

1454
02:13:26,848 --> 02:13:28,629
[SPEAKER_10]: one in the negative motion passes.

1455
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:36,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Next up we have report on connectivity in school buildings.

1456
02:13:36,211 --> 02:13:39,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Allen Arena, Dr. Peter Cushing and Mr. Dave Murphy.

1457
02:13:41,373 --> 02:13:41,973
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you Mayor.

1458
02:13:43,774 --> 02:13:54,338
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're gonna just offer what I think is going to be a brief update and then certainly we'll be eager to take questions from the committee on

1459
02:13:56,325 --> 02:14:00,467
[SPEAKER_15]: the state of our connectivity issues throughout the district.

1460
02:14:01,227 --> 02:14:03,208
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Cushing and Mr. Arena are here.

1461
02:14:03,268 --> 02:14:23,357
[SPEAKER_15]: Just prior to this meeting, I did circulate a document put together by Mr. Arena to walk the committee through some of the specific challenges and some of the milestones that we've been able to cross with regard to ensuring appropriate

1462
02:14:24,094 --> 02:14:31,376
[SPEAKER_15]: Wi-Fi capacity and network connectivity during this difficult school year.

1463
02:14:32,356 --> 02:14:52,882
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wanted to just start by saying that obviously technology, I think it's obvious if it's not, maybe it will be through this discussion, that our instructional technology and our operational technology have taken on a completely different role

1464
02:14:53,462 --> 02:15:13,694
[SPEAKER_15]: in the implementation of our instructional and other services to students this year with such a large population of students who are learning remotely at any given time, ensuring that we have reliable and effective network connectivity is of critical importance.

1465
02:15:14,254 --> 02:15:18,917
[SPEAKER_15]: At the same time that the importance and the role of our internet has,

1466
02:15:20,457 --> 02:15:38,648
[SPEAKER_15]: At the same time that our internet role has evolved, the role of our internet has evolved over the course of this year, we've been introducing new methods and devices of instructional technology in order to be consistent with the needs of all learners under the hybrid plan.

1467
02:15:38,708 --> 02:15:46,072
[SPEAKER_15]: So as you know, and as we've discussed earlier tonight, we've made significant investments in actual hardware for

1468
02:15:46,612 --> 02:15:50,213
[SPEAKER_15]: both students and staff, MacBooks and Chromebooks respectively.

1469
02:15:50,913 --> 02:15:56,234
[SPEAKER_15]: The MacBooks have been distributed and the Chromebooks to students are being distributed in waves.

1470
02:15:57,254 --> 02:16:15,738
[SPEAKER_15]: It's noteworthy for this conversation because it is our impression that there have been some perceived network connectivity issues that are in fact more device-based issues and really just a matter of a continuous troubleshooting that our technology staff has been

1471
02:16:16,896 --> 02:16:31,551
[SPEAKER_15]: very responsive to families and staff in order to make sure that people are connecting the way that the devices are meant to connect and being able to take advantage of the expansive use of instructional technology throughout the district.

1472
02:16:32,052 --> 02:16:36,977
[SPEAKER_15]: There have been some adjustments that we've made and Mr. Arena can speak in greater detail to those.

1473
02:16:37,790 --> 02:16:43,092
[SPEAKER_15]: both as we've sort of shifted our capacity from our home network to our guest network.

1474
02:16:43,552 --> 02:16:49,395
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a tactic that we're using to ensure greater connectivity throughout various school communities.

1475
02:16:50,035 --> 02:17:07,142
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not an overarching strategy and it's sort of one sort of makeshift method that we've gone to to make sure that whatever devices students are using, particularly if they're not using a district issued device, that they're still able to have

1476
02:17:07,817 --> 02:17:09,598
[SPEAKER_15]: a good user experience.

1477
02:17:10,018 --> 02:17:33,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, that obviously comes with risks, and that's part of what Mr. Arena and the rest of the tech team have been looking at on an ongoing basis to make sure that we're, in addition to providing a reliable and efficient network usage, we're also ensuring that it is a fully defended and safe and secure internet experience for all students and for staff.

1478
02:17:34,205 --> 02:17:37,186
[SPEAKER_15]: There are a couple of significant projects that are coming up

1479
02:17:38,391 --> 02:17:58,183
[SPEAKER_15]: with regard to an expansion of capacity at the high school and the cabling project that will be important, particularly as we begin to have more in-person learning happening at the high school to make sure that that capacity is there to be able to sustain the uptick in the number of in-person learners.

1480
02:17:59,664 --> 02:18:04,927
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what we're looking at right now in terms of how the first couple of months have gone.

1481
02:18:04,947 --> 02:18:07,409
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm sure that there are

1482
02:18:07,960 --> 02:18:17,843
[SPEAKER_15]: both staff and families watching this meeting who have had moments of difficulty and stress with regard to the technology.

1483
02:18:18,243 --> 02:18:25,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, that's not necessarily entirely reflective of systemic deficiencies.

1484
02:18:26,766 --> 02:18:35,409
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a combination of factors of a tremendous amount of new technology coming into the district, new uses being put into practice,

1485
02:18:36,133 --> 02:18:46,280
[SPEAKER_15]: and some issues with regard to our capacity that we're actively working on to make sure that we have the network bandwidth necessary to support everything that's happening in each school community.

1486
02:18:46,981 --> 02:19:01,271
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're happy to take your questions now and both in terms of what we've experienced and what we anticipate we'll be doing in the coming weeks and months to make sure that the structure that is necessary is there to support students.

1487
02:19:06,173 --> 02:19:06,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1488
02:19:12,196 --> 02:19:13,277
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no questions.

1489
02:19:14,157 --> 02:19:29,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Teixeira, Dr. Cushing, anything to add or can move on to number four, which is the report on instructional innovations for our most vulnerable students, which is cohort A, report on contingency plans for cohort A, Ms.

1490
02:19:29,905 --> 02:19:32,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Joan Bowen, Mr. Paul Teixeira.

1491
02:19:34,604 --> 02:19:35,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mayor.

1492
02:19:35,985 --> 02:19:36,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, everyone.

1493
02:19:36,925 --> 02:19:57,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight, we'd like to review a slide deck that highlights some of the innovative practices that are being implemented during our start of September 28th till present with Cohort A. These changes have come about due to COVID-19 and how we've all had to adjust our daily routines and practices.

1494
02:19:58,053 --> 02:20:00,594
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll start with our EL.

1495
02:20:03,936 --> 02:20:04,276
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

1496
02:20:07,263 --> 02:20:09,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So if Paul, if you want to start.

1497
02:20:10,352 --> 02:20:19,116
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so with the return to students on September 28th, we brought in our level one, level two EL students, K through 12.

1498
02:20:19,317 --> 02:20:26,060
[SPEAKER_13]: All of the teachers in the district went through PD sessions in August with better lessons.

1499
02:20:26,660 --> 02:20:37,806
[SPEAKER_13]: And the EL teachers took what programs they learned about through the better lessons and made them usable for EL students.

1500
02:20:38,446 --> 02:20:44,960
[SPEAKER_13]: And they also put together PD for the, you can go to the next slide here.

1501
02:20:45,902 --> 02:20:49,088
[SPEAKER_13]: They also put together PD for content teachers.

1502
02:20:50,183 --> 02:20:56,528
[SPEAKER_13]: to kind of highlight what are some of the best practices in working with EL students.

1503
02:20:57,549 --> 02:21:01,132
[SPEAKER_13]: So this kind of covers some of the major areas.

1504
02:21:01,652 --> 02:21:11,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Loom was one program which allows teachers to kind of record video messages for their assignments because our EL students rely heavily on auditory

1505
02:21:12,380 --> 02:21:17,664
[SPEAKER_13]: input in terms of direction and expectations and understandings.

1506
02:21:18,184 --> 02:21:25,049
[SPEAKER_13]: Our teachers put together exemplars and then can actually record voice directions for our students using that.

1507
02:21:25,910 --> 02:21:37,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Edpuzzle is another one that allows teachers to kind of embed open-ended questions, multiple choice questions on YouTube videos and teacher created videos.

1508
02:21:38,679 --> 02:21:39,620
[SPEAKER_13]: And the next slide, Peter.

1509
02:21:42,323 --> 02:21:47,426
[SPEAKER_13]: Screencastify was something else that the teachers used and shared with their colleagues.

1510
02:21:47,726 --> 02:21:50,668
[SPEAKER_13]: It also allows them to give auditory directions.

1511
02:21:51,349 --> 02:21:54,270
[SPEAKER_13]: And then Vocaroo, they all have kind of silly names.

1512
02:21:55,411 --> 02:22:01,875
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, you can give oral feedback to the students on an assignment that they've submitted through Google Classroom.

1513
02:22:02,335 --> 02:22:04,957
[SPEAKER_13]: And it also allows Yale students to

1514
02:22:05,737 --> 02:22:12,721
[SPEAKER_13]: It facilitates conversations between EL students and working groups and on papers back and forth.

1515
02:22:18,645 --> 02:22:19,225
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Joan.

1516
02:22:20,106 --> 02:22:20,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Next slide, Peter.

1517
02:22:23,568 --> 02:22:24,689
[SPEAKER_17]: Just give me one second.

1518
02:22:34,225 --> 02:22:41,109
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is one of the innovations that we were really excited about this year is Sarah McMillian, who is a Brooks School parent.

1519
02:22:41,610 --> 02:22:48,414
[SPEAKER_02]: She offered to create window masks for Medford Public Schools, and she donated over 40 masks to our staff.

1520
02:22:49,235 --> 02:22:53,998
[SPEAKER_02]: These are used by speech therapists and teachers who work with students who have hearing loss.

1521
02:22:54,598 --> 02:22:58,641
[SPEAKER_02]: And these window masks are in use across the district at all grade levels.

1522
02:22:59,042 --> 02:23:06,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd like to give a big shout out and a big thank you to Sarah McMillan for supplying our speech department with these masks.

1523
02:23:10,413 --> 02:23:19,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Our community-based learning is with our project transition program at Medford High School, and these are our students with disabilities in the ages from 18 to 21.

1524
02:23:20,798 --> 02:23:25,160
[SPEAKER_02]: When they go out into the community, they wear masks and maintain social distancing.

1525
02:23:25,880 --> 02:23:31,283
[SPEAKER_02]: They also follow the MBTA COVID-19 guidelines when they're on the buses.

1526
02:23:32,023 --> 02:23:34,864
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've had to modify our community destinations.

1527
02:23:35,044 --> 02:23:42,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Previously, students would go out and go to restaurants and order their lunch and also would work out at Planet Fitness.

1528
02:23:42,907 --> 02:23:48,269
[SPEAKER_02]: But these worksites and community destinations are currently on hold.

1529
02:23:48,669 --> 02:23:52,450
[SPEAKER_02]: But we look at worksites, and they're considered on a case-by-case basis.

1530
02:23:56,112 --> 02:24:05,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the staff have reviewed expected behaviors at the MBTA bus stops, including any COVID rules.

1531
02:24:06,103 --> 02:24:12,450
[SPEAKER_02]: So they go through what-if scenarios for students both in-person and remote prior to going out into the community.

1532
02:24:16,116 --> 02:24:24,041
[SPEAKER_02]: He has several pictures of how our students in the community-based learning are learning how to social distance in a variety of community settings.

1533
02:24:24,782 --> 02:24:34,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also are working on smaller groups of students going out into the community, which makes it more easy, it's easier to maintain social distancing.

1534
02:24:43,596 --> 02:24:51,341
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have had to make some changes about students who are receiving their services remotely as well as in person.

1535
02:24:51,902 --> 02:24:57,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So the remote students attend the community-based field trips via cell phone.

1536
02:24:57,565 --> 02:25:06,671
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the teacher will ask the remote student what bus stop they need to get off on, when to tell them, when to let them know when to get off at the bus stop.

1537
02:25:07,132 --> 02:25:11,935
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they also walk through the steps on how to load money on a Charlie card for our students.

1538
02:25:15,523 --> 02:25:20,707
[SPEAKER_02]: And shopping in Wegmans is one of the community-based trips that we continue to do.

1539
02:25:21,547 --> 02:25:26,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Students wear masks and they learn to locate the items in the store and pay for the items at checkout.

1540
02:25:27,251 --> 02:25:37,338
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the really innovative things that we're doing right now is the occupational therapist remotely includes a student who is currently in person but does not go out into the community.

1541
02:25:37,938 --> 02:25:45,826
[SPEAKER_02]: So the student creates a shopping list, logs into Zoom, instructs the occupational therapist where to go to Wegmans to find his items.

1542
02:25:46,447 --> 02:25:56,157
[SPEAKER_02]: He chooses the least expensive option for each item, selects the checkout line to stand in, and when given the total cost, tells the OT what bills to give the cashier.

1543
02:25:56,177 --> 02:26:01,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when they return to school, he counts his change and puts all his purchases away.

1544
02:26:05,179 --> 02:26:12,361
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have our paraprofessionals supporting our students in our CTE program remotely.

1545
02:26:13,082 --> 02:26:20,064
[SPEAKER_02]: And this student participates in graphic design and visual communication with the support of the access program staff.

1546
02:26:20,204 --> 02:26:25,566
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the paraprofessional under the guidance of the special educator and CTE instructor.

1547
02:26:26,106 --> 02:26:34,309
[SPEAKER_02]: They meet via Zoom and he provides this student with support throughout the school day and throughout his class in the CTE program.

1548
02:26:37,380 --> 02:26:48,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the ways he does support this student is he provides encouragement and they adapt the activity so the student is able to learn and practice skills remotely with parent support.

1549
02:26:48,605 --> 02:26:58,189
[SPEAKER_02]: And here the student is learning to change the ink and load the paper on his home printer, just like he would do if he was in school in the graphic arts department.

1550
02:27:01,092 --> 02:27:04,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in our learning group program in grades nine to 12.

1551
02:27:05,478 --> 02:27:09,283
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a six week training on assistive technology and Google tools.

1552
02:27:09,903 --> 02:27:18,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a list of skills for remote learning that was developed collaboratively by both the special education and EL teachers and related service providers.

1553
02:27:19,115 --> 02:27:32,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Based on this list, the occupational therapists and speech therapists developed and taught six sessions addressing remote learning skills and the students participated both in person and online remotely for these sessions.

1554
02:27:34,805 --> 02:27:51,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these topics cover Gmail, Google Classroom, taking screenshots, sending attachments, home workspace setup, morning routines, text to speech technology, voice typing, and whatever other resources Medford High School had to offer to them.

1555
02:28:00,456 --> 02:28:01,076
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it, Peter?

1556
02:28:04,505 --> 02:28:05,426
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's it.

1557
02:28:06,186 --> 02:28:07,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's the last slide.

1558
02:28:07,227 --> 02:28:16,152
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just wanted to thank all of the staff who worked to contribute to put this together, as well as Jan Hollenbeck, who really took the lead in this.

1559
02:28:16,612 --> 02:28:23,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also wanted to thank all the parents for allowing their students to participate and to give us permission for using their photos.

1560
02:28:23,436 --> 02:28:28,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really a great opportunity to put everything together that they're doing.

1561
02:28:28,099 --> 02:28:30,000
[SPEAKER_02]: So kudos to all the staff.

1562
02:28:33,845 --> 02:28:35,686
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Miss Bowen.

1563
02:28:38,629 --> 02:28:39,469
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

1564
02:28:41,171 --> 02:28:43,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Joan and Paul.

1565
02:28:44,620 --> 02:28:45,221
[SPEAKER_08]: very much for this.

1566
02:28:45,321 --> 02:28:55,229
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really great to see our students highlighted in this way and the work of our teachers and staff highlighted to show how the remote learning is working in different circumstances.

1567
02:28:55,349 --> 02:28:58,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I really, really enjoyed watching this.

1568
02:28:58,932 --> 02:29:01,495
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have to say, I was writing down my questions.

1569
02:29:02,075 --> 02:29:07,540
[SPEAKER_08]: And my question was, is there any collaboration between special education and English language

1570
02:29:07,900 --> 02:29:29,597
[SPEAKER_08]: teachers as I was writing it and literally your very next slide was you know oh this collaboration that we did around you know the six-week training and which was so I think is so important in our schools it's really good to see this interdepartmental collaboration and I want to encourage that even more and again in sharing the resources and just seeing like when Paul was showing his slides about

1571
02:29:30,467 --> 02:29:34,790
[SPEAKER_08]: the different assistive technologies, the loom and the ed puzzle.

1572
02:29:34,850 --> 02:29:38,792
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was thinking, my goodness, those would work so well for special education too.

1573
02:29:38,872 --> 02:29:42,755
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously you guys are already on top of all of that, but I think that's really great.

1574
02:29:42,875 --> 02:29:51,000
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also love to see if there's any way in which, first of all, I didn't see this PowerPoint in our packet and maybe I missed it.

1575
02:29:51,080 --> 02:29:52,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I saw a narrative.

1576
02:29:53,161 --> 02:29:57,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I can send it to you if you'd like, like me too.

1577
02:29:57,925 --> 02:29:58,746
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not a problem.

1578
02:29:58,786 --> 02:29:59,366
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like that.

1579
02:29:59,466 --> 02:30:01,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would like, yeah, no, I would like that.

1580
02:30:01,368 --> 02:30:01,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1581
02:30:02,069 --> 02:30:02,949
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the other is,

1582
02:30:04,567 --> 02:30:22,299
[SPEAKER_08]: is whether there's an opportunity to share some of the sort of, I guess, the takeaways from the training that the departments did together, both with the community at large and frankly, our general education teachers and others.

1583
02:30:22,359 --> 02:30:28,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Because again, I think that when we're talking about universal design for learning, I think that

1584
02:30:29,083 --> 02:30:39,789
[SPEAKER_08]: you, Joan and you, Paul, have these departments that really provide universal design for learning in a way that is so rich that a lot of other community members, you know, maybe don't realize.

1585
02:30:40,629 --> 02:30:47,413
[SPEAKER_08]: And so if you could share that with the community and with, you know, the staff at large, I think it would be really, really helpful.

1586
02:30:48,090 --> 02:30:52,751
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, not to give you guys more work, but just sort of, I don't know what that would look like or how that might be done.

1587
02:30:52,771 --> 02:30:59,973
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that there's been a, you know, a resource list of sort of, you know, websites, which can get cumbersome in terms of assistive technology.

1588
02:30:59,993 --> 02:31:11,255
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we all feel overwhelmed with those when we see them, but I don't know if it's a best of or things that, you know, a presentation or deck, a slide deck that you guys have done that could be helpful, I think would be really useful.

1589
02:31:12,085 --> 02:31:21,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think there's also a lot of conversations behind the scene between special education teachers, EL teachers and gen ed teachers talking about this is what's working really well for me.

1590
02:31:21,989 --> 02:31:22,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you tried this?

1591
02:31:23,330 --> 02:31:27,992
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe formalizing it in a way so everyone has those resources available to them.

1592
02:31:28,652 --> 02:31:34,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my God, that would be like my dream come true for having even run for office.

1593
02:31:34,535 --> 02:31:41,299
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of the things that'd be probably my top two list of what I would like to see is this interdepartment collaboration.

1594
02:31:41,319 --> 02:31:49,304
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's so essential because I think you all have so much expertise to add, you know, to bring to the table that I'd like to see everybody be able to have access.

1595
02:31:49,324 --> 02:31:49,904
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

1596
02:31:50,645 --> 02:31:50,925
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1597
02:31:52,049 --> 02:32:16,707
[SPEAKER_13]: Just to add to that, on those presentations, the EL teachers did do PowerPoint presentations for the entire school community, and they were placed in an asynchronous folder that was for the 10 days of opening of school, and teachers were doing professional development, some live, some asynchronous, and this was a asynchronous folder that was available to all teachers for these best practices.

1598
02:32:18,626 --> 02:32:19,386
[SPEAKER_08]: That's wonderful.

1599
02:32:19,446 --> 02:32:26,691
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any way, Superintendent Edouard-Vincent, that some of this could be made available to the community at large?

1600
02:32:30,092 --> 02:32:34,375
[SPEAKER_03]: In particular, when you say community at large, the slide deck or the different activities?

1601
02:32:36,616 --> 02:32:38,317
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say probably the slide deck.

1602
02:32:38,857 --> 02:32:39,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1603
02:32:40,018 --> 02:32:43,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we can definitely have the slide deck can be posted on the website.

1604
02:32:46,715 --> 02:32:51,918
[SPEAKER_03]: we can link it into this update as well, community update.

1605
02:32:52,139 --> 02:32:52,699
[SPEAKER_08]: That'd be great.

1606
02:32:52,799 --> 02:33:10,450
[SPEAKER_08]: And also, yeah, and just like the best practices that Paul's talking about, just sort of, you know, the highlights, if you can, of this, of this professional development training, what have you that I think, I think this can really translate to families at home to, you know, that are working in remote learning environments.

1607
02:33:10,550 --> 02:33:13,072
[SPEAKER_08]: And, again, it's universal design for learning.

1608
02:33:13,132 --> 02:33:14,333
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it'd be great.

1609
02:33:14,393 --> 02:33:14,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1610
02:33:15,213 --> 02:33:15,994
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1611
02:33:19,244 --> 02:33:20,024
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Van De Kloop?

1612
02:33:20,865 --> 02:33:22,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just wanted to say thank you.

1613
02:33:22,465 --> 02:33:28,128
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really great to see the innovative ideas of our teachers and our students.

1614
02:33:28,228 --> 02:33:32,330
[SPEAKER_06]: Clearly, some of the photos we saw enjoying themselves.

1615
02:33:32,430 --> 02:33:36,892
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure that behind each one of these, there's many more stories that could be told.

1616
02:33:36,972 --> 02:33:46,196
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's nice, especially when we have this kind of meeting, which has had its difficult points to then have this bright side.

1617
02:33:46,376 --> 02:33:48,517
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much for your report.

1618
02:33:49,222 --> 02:33:49,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1619
02:33:52,645 --> 02:33:53,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau?

1620
02:33:54,506 --> 02:33:55,147
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, thank you.

1621
02:33:55,988 --> 02:33:59,030
[SPEAKER_16]: Any better by folks?

1622
02:34:02,053 --> 02:34:07,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Just a technical question about the last sentence on the first page of the report that we received.

1623
02:34:09,339 --> 02:34:14,403
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sort of embarrassed I don't know this, but are we not still in a declared state of emergency?

1624
02:34:18,696 --> 02:34:19,376
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you would know.

1625
02:34:21,557 --> 02:34:22,618
[SPEAKER_10]: State of emergency still?

1626
02:34:23,038 --> 02:34:23,639
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, we are.

1627
02:34:23,659 --> 02:34:24,919
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, good.

1628
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:33,165
[SPEAKER_16]: I just because this, uh, you know this sentence unless we just unless we have a declared state of emergency, and we definitely already have one.

1629
02:34:33,185 --> 02:34:36,066
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to be clear that that was already the case.

1630
02:34:36,667 --> 02:34:38,528
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I didn't have any other questions.

1631
02:34:38,548 --> 02:34:39,348
[SPEAKER_16]: This was excellent.

1632
02:34:39,408 --> 02:34:40,109
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1633
02:34:42,610 --> 02:34:42,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1634
02:34:43,771 --> 02:34:44,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1635
02:34:44,952 --> 02:34:45,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Miss Bowen.

1636
02:34:45,672 --> 02:34:46,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Tixera.

1637
02:34:48,873 --> 02:34:51,534
[SPEAKER_10]: Number five, we have report on the remote academy, Ms.

1638
02:34:51,554 --> 02:34:53,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Suzanne Galusi and Dr. Peter Cushing.

1639
02:34:56,776 --> 02:34:57,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening.

1640
02:34:57,676 --> 02:34:58,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

1641
02:35:00,617 --> 02:35:07,920
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so Dr. Cushing and I are going to report on the Metro Public Schools remote learning models, and we're going to start with the elementary.

1642
02:35:08,901 --> 02:35:17,288
[SPEAKER_09]: So at the elementary, thank you, at the elementary level, we refer to the remote model as the remote academy.

1643
02:35:18,128 --> 02:35:26,835
[SPEAKER_09]: That is mostly because at the elementary level, every school building has a remote academy strand that runs within the school building.

1644
02:35:27,476 --> 02:35:32,100
[SPEAKER_09]: So for each of the four elementary schools, there is at least one classroom

1645
02:35:32,923 --> 02:35:38,033
[SPEAKER_09]: for grades K through five that has the remote academy students present in it.

1646
02:35:38,995 --> 02:35:44,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Each remote academy classroom is comprised of Medford Public Schools employees and teachers.

1647
02:35:46,015 --> 02:35:55,441
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big piece where some school systems were unable to house a remote academy for the district using district staff.

1648
02:35:55,461 --> 02:35:58,663
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of them have housed that out to online platforms.

1649
02:35:58,743 --> 02:36:02,645
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's very important that we've done that with our Medford Public Schools staff.

1650
02:36:04,606 --> 02:36:12,171
[SPEAKER_09]: We are continuing to follow the Medford Public Schools remote schedule as it was established on the first day of school.

1651
02:36:12,251 --> 02:36:14,512
[SPEAKER_09]: For children that are enrolled in the remote academy,

1652
02:36:15,203 --> 02:36:16,964
[SPEAKER_09]: They work with their teacher virtually.

1653
02:36:17,424 --> 02:36:21,266
[SPEAKER_09]: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday is a full day of virtual school.

1654
02:36:21,886 --> 02:36:27,149
[SPEAKER_09]: And so students log on from 8.30 to 2.30, following the schedule with their teacher.

1655
02:36:28,049 --> 02:36:30,350
[SPEAKER_09]: It is a mix of synchronous and asynchronous time.

1656
02:36:30,791 --> 02:36:33,412
[SPEAKER_09]: And Wednesday is a half day of virtual school.

1657
02:36:33,972 --> 02:36:35,753
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go to the next slide, Dr. Cushing, thank you.

1658
02:36:37,437 --> 02:36:45,242
[SPEAKER_09]: So as stated previously, the Elementary Remote Academy schedule began on the first day of school, which was September 15th.

1659
02:36:46,283 --> 02:36:51,766
[SPEAKER_09]: That schedule is how all elementary students in Medford Public Schools began the school year.

1660
02:36:51,826 --> 02:36:54,768
[SPEAKER_09]: As we all know, we started remotely for a few weeks.

1661
02:36:55,248 --> 02:36:56,189
[SPEAKER_09]: That schedule has

1662
02:36:56,989 --> 02:36:57,810
[SPEAKER_09]: really not changed.

1663
02:36:57,850 --> 02:37:02,235
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been the same schedule that students have been following all along.

1664
02:37:02,796 --> 02:37:08,061
[SPEAKER_09]: And even the hybrid, the current hybrid schedule is based off of the remote schedule.

1665
02:37:08,983 --> 02:37:20,648
[SPEAKER_09]: So the consistencies, just to speak about specifically, are that students are attending their virtual school every single day, five days a week, as stated in the previous slide.

1666
02:37:21,108 --> 02:37:27,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Four of those days, Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, are mostly synchronous instruction with the teacher.

1667
02:37:28,711 --> 02:37:30,952
[SPEAKER_09]: The Wednesday is a mixture of both.

1668
02:37:31,152 --> 02:37:34,393
[SPEAKER_09]: So the students start their morning synchronously with the teacher.

1669
02:37:35,437 --> 02:37:41,023
[SPEAKER_09]: for about two to three blocks and then finish the day with asynchronous lessons.

1670
02:37:42,344 --> 02:37:48,269
[SPEAKER_09]: The academic blocks are aligned by grade level and district wide.

1671
02:37:48,670 --> 02:37:57,538
[SPEAKER_09]: So students in the fourth grade remote learning academy, let's say at the Roberts School, have the same exact schedule as fourth grade students at McGlynn Elementary School.

1672
02:37:58,623 --> 02:38:03,124
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the consistency through the schools and through the district.

1673
02:38:03,524 --> 02:38:07,705
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been two small changes to the remote element, to the remote academy.

1674
02:38:08,926 --> 02:38:16,447
[SPEAKER_09]: The first was we had to add three minutes of transition and transitional time between specialist blocks.

1675
02:38:17,448 --> 02:38:22,849
[SPEAKER_09]: So specialists meaning art, PE, physical education and technology.

1676
02:38:25,755 --> 02:38:33,838
[SPEAKER_09]: This allows both the students and the specialists a little bit of transitional time to go from class to class.

1677
02:38:35,459 --> 02:38:52,006
[SPEAKER_09]: The other change was in order to meet the needs of all students and ensure that every Medford public school student, whether they're in the remote academy or the hybrid learning model, have access to their specialist teachers.

1678
02:38:52,906 --> 02:39:00,169
[SPEAKER_09]: There may have been a change in the specialist teacher as the hybrid model came to completion.

1679
02:39:00,889 --> 02:39:04,311
[SPEAKER_09]: The staggered, excuse me, hybrid model came to completion at the elementary level.

1680
02:39:06,031 --> 02:39:07,492
[SPEAKER_09]: You may go to the next slide, please.

1681
02:39:09,973 --> 02:39:13,975
[SPEAKER_09]: And this talks a little bit of our enrollment for both learning models.

1682
02:39:14,997 --> 02:39:17,318
[SPEAKER_09]: So you can see it's coded by school.

1683
02:39:17,818 --> 02:39:24,160
[SPEAKER_09]: It has all the grade spans listed and it has the enrollment currently for the hybrid and the remote classrooms.

1684
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:30,702
[SPEAKER_09]: You'll notice that some schools have one remote learning academy strand and some schools may have two.

1685
02:39:30,822 --> 02:39:37,924
[SPEAKER_09]: This was based on enrollment numbers, which have ebbed and flowed as we began with the first week of school.

1686
02:39:39,024 --> 02:39:44,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Requests as mentioned in the dynamic reopening plan that was

1687
02:39:45,444 --> 02:39:53,901
[SPEAKER_09]: a collaborative approach to planning, which we involved all stakeholders, teachers, administration,

1688
02:39:54,550 --> 02:40:18,478
[SPEAKER_09]: staff as well as parents and caregivers, we put in that model requests for switching between learning models and it was stated that it's about two weeks prior to the close of each marking period or on a case-by-case basis as needed as we're well aware that certain situations within family dynamics come up and decisions may need to be made sooner than

1689
02:40:19,578 --> 02:40:22,060
[SPEAKER_09]: two weeks prior to the end of each marking period.

1690
02:40:22,720 --> 02:40:39,412
[SPEAKER_09]: These two dates are given that are reflected here Friday, December 11 and Friday, March 5 are the two weeks prior to when report cards will be going out and when the formal process for making requests to switching learning models can begin.

1691
02:40:41,727 --> 02:40:49,133
[SPEAKER_09]: what we would do is we just ask that you get in touch with the school principal and they will talk to you about the process for that.

1692
02:40:50,554 --> 02:40:55,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Final decisions for any switch in the models are based on staffing and space availability.

1693
02:40:56,498 --> 02:41:07,546
[SPEAKER_09]: As Dr. Edouard-Vincent mentioned in her opening statements, we have really wanted to make sure that we created models that provide families with,

1694
02:41:08,797 --> 02:41:14,741
[SPEAKER_09]: as much choice as possible for what is best for their family situation and their children.

1695
02:41:15,261 --> 02:41:25,268
[SPEAKER_09]: And so based on that, we've been able to provide two learning models and we've tried to work with families on a case by case basis to do what's best

1696
02:41:25,852 --> 02:41:28,053
[SPEAKER_09]: for the current situation that they are in.

1697
02:41:28,673 --> 02:41:39,238
[SPEAKER_09]: So if, when those switches are made, the majority of the time it will result in a new teacher and a new set of classmates for that student switching.

1698
02:41:41,720 --> 02:41:49,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Regardless of the model that students are learning in, whether it's hybrid or remote, classrooms right now cannot exceed about 25 students.

1699
02:41:54,593 --> 02:42:02,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I will, I know that I believe this is my last slide, but I just want to, yep, thank you very much.

1700
02:42:02,858 --> 02:42:20,830
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to reiterate that certain decisions may be, not everyone may agree with some of the decisions in terms of making requests and it involves switching learning models, but I really think it's,

1701
02:42:21,835 --> 02:42:25,336
[SPEAKER_09]: All decisions made have the best interest of students at heart.

1702
02:42:26,716 --> 02:42:27,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1703
02:42:27,136 --> 02:42:31,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you very much, Ms.

1704
02:42:31,377 --> 02:42:32,818
[SPEAKER_17]: Galussi.

1705
02:42:33,498 --> 02:42:43,660
[SPEAKER_17]: So for Medford Public Schools secondary, our remote and hybrid learning, it's a blended model that allows families with the greatest choice possible.

1706
02:42:43,781 --> 02:42:49,042
[SPEAKER_17]: So there is, you know, we have remote learners at the secondary level, but no specific remote academy.

1707
02:42:50,159 --> 02:43:04,211
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, there's this opportunity to shift between the models as your family's comfort level or if you've been identified as a student who needs to quarantine, you know, you're here today and then you're online tomorrow.

1708
02:43:04,551 --> 02:43:13,119
[SPEAKER_17]: You have this opportunity to still be at least virtually with the peers that you started the year with, with the teachers that you've been with,

1709
02:43:14,685 --> 02:43:19,189
[SPEAKER_17]: and to maintain those relationships and to maintain those connections.

1710
02:43:19,890 --> 02:43:25,696
[SPEAKER_17]: So they learn with their peers in classes that are being live streamed by Medford educators.

1711
02:43:26,857 --> 02:43:31,421
[SPEAKER_17]: They're using webcams and we're currently field testing some other setups right now.

1712
02:43:32,002 --> 02:43:37,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Numerous elementary, middle and high school educators have been field testing those.

1713
02:43:39,554 --> 02:43:45,640
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, the, the, there is a reality coming though, as we bring our high school back.

1714
02:43:46,401 --> 02:43:49,724
[SPEAKER_17]: And with the, with the middle schools.

1715
02:43:50,585 --> 02:43:56,127
[SPEAKER_17]: The granting of some statutory accommodations is definitely presenting staffing challenges.

1716
02:43:56,307 --> 02:44:03,049
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent has made mention of this in her weekly updates for the past two weeks.

1717
02:44:03,129 --> 02:44:04,650
[SPEAKER_17]: She made mention of it this evening.

1718
02:44:05,930 --> 02:44:13,993
[SPEAKER_17]: We definitely would like to see the community's help in either volunteering or applying for positions to monitor classrooms.

1719
02:44:15,257 --> 02:44:20,279
[SPEAKER_17]: as we sunset the HVAC problems and work through those as quickly as possible.

1720
02:44:20,839 --> 02:44:22,779
[SPEAKER_08]: This would definitely- Can I just make a point of information?

1721
02:44:22,919 --> 02:44:23,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me.

1722
02:44:23,439 --> 02:44:30,241
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little bit of educator ease, I guess, for lack of a better word.

1723
02:44:30,281 --> 02:44:35,283
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm wondering if you can just simplify a little bit for folks, statutory accommodations.

1724
02:44:36,203 --> 02:44:43,525
[SPEAKER_17]: So if a person makes a request for an accommodation to, say, teach remotely because of a preexisting health condition,

1725
02:44:44,220 --> 02:44:59,971
[SPEAKER_17]: or something like that, the counter to that might be a leave of absence, which would leave us in a substantially worse off situation to not have our great Medford educators working with the students even remotely.

1726
02:45:00,271 --> 02:45:10,938
[SPEAKER_17]: But then you lose their ability to supervise students in the classroom, which is a part and parcel function of being an educator is that supervisory aspect.

1727
02:45:11,693 --> 02:45:16,475
[SPEAKER_17]: So while those teachers are teaching reverse remote, we need people to cover.

1728
02:45:16,796 --> 02:45:28,722
[SPEAKER_17]: And our directors right now, as an example, are doing a tremendous amount of work across the district, being in classrooms, monitoring and supervising students.

1729
02:45:29,622 --> 02:45:31,543
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the example.

1730
02:45:33,708 --> 02:45:48,385
[SPEAKER_08]: So just for clarification if I if I might through the chair, I guess what I hear you saying is that in some instances their educators who have required statutory accommodations meaning through like a DA Americans with disabilities or something like that.

1731
02:45:49,746 --> 02:45:54,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Or the COVID families first or the recently enacted COVID legislation.

1732
02:45:54,929 --> 02:45:55,229
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1733
02:45:55,749 --> 02:46:07,396
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that has led to reverse remote teaching, which means teaching from a remote location with students in the class watching the teacher on a monitor who's teaching remotely.

1734
02:46:07,756 --> 02:46:13,139
[SPEAKER_08]: And in those situations, there obviously needs to be some supervision of the students.

1735
02:46:13,279 --> 02:46:17,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And that has led to some

1736
02:46:18,742 --> 02:46:24,685
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, lacking of in staffing, which is why you're looking for these additional folks to help support.

1737
02:46:24,745 --> 02:46:26,726
[SPEAKER_17]: It's definitely been an all hands on deck.

1738
02:46:27,047 --> 02:46:30,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, the more grades we bring in, the more challenges we face.

1739
02:46:32,289 --> 02:46:35,071
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I appreciate the question, by the way.

1740
02:46:35,571 --> 02:46:39,013
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Dr. Christian, can I just add a very quick comment on this?

1741
02:46:39,093 --> 02:46:39,974
[SPEAKER_17]: I would love for you to.

1742
02:46:39,994 --> 02:46:40,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1743
02:46:41,063 --> 02:47:01,937
[SPEAKER_15]: So we, this has obviously happened more at the middle school level than the high school level thus far, where there's a communication that generally goes from the principal to families of students who will be receiving a in-person learning experience, but at various parts of their day, there will be these instances of reverse remote.

1744
02:47:02,478 --> 02:47:08,562
[SPEAKER_15]: And as Dr. Cushing said, oftentimes this is the result of a staff member receiving

1745
02:47:09,058 --> 02:47:13,342
[SPEAKER_15]: an accommodation to which under the ADA analysis they are statutorily entitled to.

1746
02:47:13,662 --> 02:47:15,504
[SPEAKER_15]: There are some other exceptions.

1747
02:47:15,524 --> 02:47:24,231
[SPEAKER_15]: There are times when educators are forced to quarantine and therefore there's a shorter period of time in which reverse remote instruction occurs.

1748
02:47:24,591 --> 02:47:34,380
[SPEAKER_15]: And there are some other extenuating circumstances in which the staff member is granted the opportunity to continue to work remotely and the students are

1749
02:47:36,501 --> 02:47:38,221
[SPEAKER_15]: are in person and in the school building.

1750
02:47:38,521 --> 02:47:40,822
[SPEAKER_15]: There's just two points that I wanted to make about that.

1751
02:47:42,002 --> 02:47:47,323
[SPEAKER_15]: The first is that we really are trying to minimize that.

1752
02:47:47,863 --> 02:47:57,705
[SPEAKER_15]: And because we recognize that the in-person learning experience is meant to be as in-person as a twice a week schedule is going to allow for.

1753
02:47:58,025 --> 02:48:05,626
[SPEAKER_15]: So when you're already in those situations in which you are quote in-person, but you're only in-person for 40% of the typical school week,

1754
02:48:05,975 --> 02:48:12,860
[SPEAKER_15]: We really want as little reverse remote instruction as possible, but it is unavoidable to some degree.

1755
02:48:13,220 --> 02:48:27,950
[SPEAKER_15]: The other piece of that that I think, and I think, frankly, just to be clear, and I wanna be candid about this, we have had a really good and constructive dialogue with our bargaining partners over these issues of accommodations and other extenuating circumstances.

1756
02:48:28,650 --> 02:48:35,415
[SPEAKER_15]: As the high school comes back, as Dr. Cushing said, the number of instances in which this is a challenge is going to increase.

1757
02:48:36,110 --> 02:48:54,982
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're going to have to continue having very constructive dialogue with our bargaining partners, because while there are some instances, and I'm obviously not going to go into specifics, but there are some instances in which the person is clearly entitled to that statutory accommodation, there are other times when there is not a statutory entitlement.

1758
02:48:55,522 --> 02:49:05,549
[SPEAKER_15]: And we get into a part of the analysis in which we're weighing the legitimate extenuating circumstances that the world is operating under and how it's affecting individual employees

1759
02:49:06,023 --> 02:49:16,690
[SPEAKER_15]: But then what is a very compelling interest that I think we should sort of give voice to here, which is that students should have as much in-person instruction as the circumstances will allow.

1760
02:49:17,130 --> 02:49:25,296
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it can't be the case that everyone who might have a preference to work remotely is allowed to work remotely.

1761
02:49:25,696 --> 02:49:29,138
[SPEAKER_15]: And we meet with the employees on an individual basis.

1762
02:49:29,198 --> 02:49:35,823
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, I can't stress enough how grateful we are for the ongoing dialogue that we have with the union representatives

1763
02:49:36,253 --> 02:50:00,081
[SPEAKER_15]: But these are at times difficult conversations that the committee and the community should be aware of, because I think there have been a few comments in the past, not from the committee members necessarily, where there has been a perception that anyone who walks in the door and says, I'm gonna work remotely because reasons X, Y, and Z, the district is not in a position to just say yes to all of those requests.

1764
02:50:00,281 --> 02:50:04,403
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we were to do that, we would have a significantly greater proportion

1765
02:50:04,885 --> 02:50:09,308
[SPEAKER_15]: of reverse remote instruction, which is frankly not what I think students are entitled to.

1766
02:50:09,348 --> 02:50:13,491
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think not what as an organization we've deemed to be in the best interest of students.

1767
02:50:13,551 --> 02:50:24,458
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is an ongoing tension and a point that is sort of accelerating as we get ready to bring more in-person instruction back at the high school.

1768
02:50:24,518 --> 02:50:29,261
[SPEAKER_15]: But I just, I hope I haven't belabored this, but it's a fairly critical,

1769
02:50:30,914 --> 02:50:33,595
[SPEAKER_15]: back and forth that's happening right now within the organization.

1770
02:50:33,635 --> 02:50:54,501
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it was, it's worth highlighting so that folks understand, um, that the sort of challenges that we're under, because there's no one that's showing up and just saying, look, I don't, I just prefer to work at home, but there's a, there's a long way between the person who's statutorily entitled to it because of a legitimate disability and the person who, um, you know, just likes the couch, right.

1771
02:50:54,561 --> 02:50:56,702
[SPEAKER_15]: There's like, there's, there are miles in between there.

1772
02:50:57,362 --> 02:50:59,324
[SPEAKER_15]: and there are compelling interests on both sides.

1773
02:50:59,384 --> 02:51:05,449
[SPEAKER_15]: But one of the ones that we have to protect and the central one we have to protect is the right for students to receive in-person instruction.

1774
02:51:06,090 --> 02:51:12,735
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was a longer point than Dr. Cushing was probably anticipating when I interrupted him, but I appreciate his indulgence and yours.

1775
02:51:14,937 --> 02:51:21,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Murphy, I greatly appreciate the further expounding on it because it just also goes to say that

1776
02:51:22,302 --> 02:51:26,806
[SPEAKER_17]: And as Dr. Edward mentioned and said, we're gonna need the community's help in order to keep bringing kids back.

1777
02:51:27,106 --> 02:51:37,194
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, our educators and the next bullet point talking about our educators and Councilors, it is- I just had, I'm sorry, I had one more point of clarification.

1778
02:51:37,234 --> 02:51:39,156
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, I don't think the mayor is seeing my hand right now.

1779
02:51:39,476 --> 02:51:42,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I did see your hand, but I- You were waiting for me.

1780
02:51:42,639 --> 02:51:44,100
[SPEAKER_08]: But I didn't know it was a point of clarification.

1781
02:51:44,540 --> 02:51:46,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of clarification, Member McLaughlin.

1782
02:51:46,982 --> 02:51:48,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mayor.

1783
02:51:48,463 --> 02:51:48,984
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to,

1784
02:51:50,975 --> 02:51:56,662
[SPEAKER_08]: So the families are, as we discussed in previous meetings, being notified.

1785
02:51:57,333 --> 02:52:04,016
[SPEAKER_08]: if they are in a situation where their student is receiving reverse remote instruction, correct?

1786
02:52:04,296 --> 02:52:07,717
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a system set up for that where the school leader does contact the families.

1787
02:52:07,757 --> 02:52:11,419
[SPEAKER_15]: There's been one instance in which there was sort of a middle ground.

1788
02:52:11,919 --> 02:52:22,343
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of complicated, but we have a system for what happens if people are quarantining, a system for what happens if people are assigned to work remotely and therefore will be offering in-person instruction.

1789
02:52:22,423 --> 02:52:24,964
[SPEAKER_15]: I know of at least one instance at the elementary level where

1790
02:52:25,528 --> 02:52:27,469
[SPEAKER_15]: situation fell between those two.

1791
02:52:27,549 --> 02:52:33,352
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a crack in between those two systems that were established, but generally speaking, yes, the principles of contacting families.

1792
02:52:34,192 --> 02:52:34,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1793
02:52:35,853 --> 02:52:36,073
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1794
02:52:36,093 --> 02:52:50,840
[SPEAKER_17]: And so the other thing too about how we're doing this at the secondary level really affords our Medford educators and our Councilors who know our kids to still be in contact with them, to still be delivering the content through the pacing guides our directors have

1795
02:52:51,460 --> 02:52:54,441
[SPEAKER_17]: constructed and to be able to be supporting students.

1796
02:52:54,601 --> 02:53:15,248
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, our middle school principals worked diligently with staff this summer to come up with a schedule that would, once the students return to school, would minimize transitions, would really give students an opportunity to not be logging into multiple Zooms a day, like following a regular schedule to limit those transitions.

1797
02:53:16,009 --> 02:53:20,832
[SPEAKER_17]: and try to really expand the longer blocks of instructional time.

1798
02:53:21,072 --> 02:53:25,615
[SPEAKER_17]: And our teachers have been working very diligently on all of these things.

1799
02:53:26,595 --> 02:53:42,224
[SPEAKER_17]: Having been around the buildings the last few days, seeing the students in the seventh and eighth grade come in, it's just great to see the excitement on our teachers' faces, to see them returning to rooms that have been repaired, and really working with our students.

1800
02:53:43,385 --> 02:53:44,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Our next slide.

1801
02:53:46,028 --> 02:53:51,012
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, these are data as of October 31st.

1802
02:53:51,072 --> 02:53:53,294
[SPEAKER_17]: We're in the process of updating these.

1803
02:53:54,315 --> 02:53:57,277
[SPEAKER_17]: So the colors here represent the various cohorts.

1804
02:53:57,357 --> 02:54:00,940
[SPEAKER_17]: These are our middle school numbers for Andrews Middle School in McGlynn.

1805
02:54:02,902 --> 02:54:05,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Cohort A and B on Monday and Tuesday.

1806
02:54:06,805 --> 02:54:10,188
[SPEAKER_17]: For the Andrews is a total of 160 students in and for the McGlynn is 217 students in.

1807
02:54:14,313 --> 02:54:16,654
[SPEAKER_17]: on Thursday and Friday.

1808
02:54:17,554 --> 02:54:18,714
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, on Monday and Tuesday.

1809
02:54:19,534 --> 02:54:28,436
[SPEAKER_17]: And then for cohorts C and A, we have 165 for the Andrews and we have 199 for the McGlynn.

1810
02:54:29,436 --> 02:54:34,837
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you can see the number of students who are full remote as of two weeks ago.

1811
02:54:34,977 --> 02:54:38,237
[SPEAKER_17]: We are working on updating these as the eighth grade comes in.

1812
02:54:38,437 --> 02:54:41,318
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanted to push pause, but we'll update these numbers every two weeks.

1813
02:54:41,963 --> 02:55:11,207
[SPEAKER_17]: The great thing about this model is, let's say that you're in for hybrid, you're going four days a week as a high needs student, or you're going two days a week as a student who's not high needs, and your family receives a positive diagnosis or simply needs to quarantine, you can just automatically shift that very next day and still maintain with the same classes that you're with, and then vice versa.

1814
02:55:11,903 --> 02:55:20,267
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, your family situation changes and you want your child to come to school more full-time, they are welcome to come.

1815
02:55:20,567 --> 02:55:25,989
[SPEAKER_17]: We would ask just a few days notification, but it literally could be the next day.

1816
02:55:26,009 --> 02:55:30,611
[SPEAKER_17]: We would just like the principals and teachers to be aware of that transition back.

1817
02:55:31,912 --> 02:55:37,174
[SPEAKER_17]: And then here is our high school, Medford High School numbers.

1818
02:55:39,196 --> 02:55:45,821
[SPEAKER_17]: are what are anticipated numbers based on where we are moving forward.

1819
02:55:45,921 --> 02:55:49,624
[SPEAKER_17]: So Monday, Tuesday would be 475 students in.

1820
02:55:50,605 --> 02:55:54,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Thursday, Friday would be 485 students in.

1821
02:55:55,148 --> 02:55:58,331
[SPEAKER_17]: And then there are the remote students as well.

1822
02:56:02,154 --> 02:56:04,876
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll stop the share unless you have specific questions on numbers.

1823
02:56:09,700 --> 02:56:12,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin, then member Ruseau, then member Vanden Heuvel.

1824
02:56:13,963 --> 02:56:14,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1825
02:56:14,923 --> 02:56:15,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for this report.

1826
02:56:16,024 --> 02:56:21,888
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very helpful that I'm a visual learner, so the color coding is real, excuse me, also really helpful.

1827
02:56:23,109 --> 02:56:38,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm wondering, does this show, or I didn't necessarily see, you know, for lack of a better word, cohort A, which would be, you know, our most vulnerable students that are actually cohort D. So in other words, our most vulnerable students who are remote.

1828
02:56:40,182 --> 02:56:42,503
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't see that disaggregated, or did I miss something?

1829
02:56:43,223 --> 02:56:45,184
[SPEAKER_17]: You didn't.

1830
02:56:45,424 --> 02:57:06,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Per desi, those students are to be put into the cohort D. We were initially classifying them, even if they were choosing to be full remote, as cohort A. But the designation per desi's attendance has to be cohort D. I can understand that.

1831
02:57:07,888 --> 02:57:10,969
[SPEAKER_08]: purposes, but I think for Medford purposes, it might be helpful.

1832
02:57:11,430 --> 02:57:13,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm assuming you guys can disaggregate, right?

1833
02:57:13,511 --> 02:57:14,751
[SPEAKER_08]: That data?

1834
02:57:15,631 --> 02:57:23,215
[SPEAKER_17]: So we definitely know who those students are, but we didn't see a need to disaggregate the data for the data purposes only.

1835
02:57:24,915 --> 02:57:25,396
[SPEAKER_17]: We can though.

1836
02:57:25,976 --> 02:57:26,096
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1837
02:57:27,173 --> 02:57:33,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just out of curiosity for those just thinking of those families and and you know how or whether remote is working.

1838
02:57:33,478 --> 02:57:34,899
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just it's just a curiosity.

1839
02:57:34,999 --> 02:57:38,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I was wondering about it doesn't have to be here, but it's something that I'm interested in.

1840
02:57:39,002 --> 02:57:43,806
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can follow up with with Joan if that's okay with Miss Bowen and then

1841
02:57:45,824 --> 02:57:47,665
[SPEAKER_08]: The other is just for a point of clarification.

1842
02:57:47,705 --> 02:57:58,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I had asked for this information specifically because I really needed some definition around the remote academy, which is a word that we heard being used a lot.

1843
02:57:59,313 --> 02:58:06,878
[SPEAKER_08]: And just for folks that are watching and just for clarification sake, the remote academy exists at the elementary school level.

1844
02:58:06,918 --> 02:58:12,662
[SPEAKER_08]: There is not a remote academy at the middle and high school level is what you were saying in your presentation.

1845
02:58:12,682 --> 02:58:14,804
[SPEAKER_08]: But just again, to sort of put that

1846
02:58:15,364 --> 02:58:21,446
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, thread throughout the presentation so that folks really understand what that is and what that means and that it's not interchangeable.

1847
02:58:21,466 --> 02:58:28,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's, can't put too fine a point on that for all of the reasons that you just mentioned as well, Dr. Cushing.

1848
02:58:28,468 --> 02:58:30,609
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for clarifying that.

1849
02:58:35,610 --> 02:58:40,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Member, I think it was Rousseau, then Member Van der Kloot.

1850
02:58:41,552 --> 02:58:44,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I actually just have emails from the public, so I'll wait until the end.

1851
02:58:45,841 --> 02:58:46,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Van der Kloot.

1852
02:58:47,582 --> 02:58:53,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I wanted to go back to the elementary portion and ask specifically two things.

1853
02:58:54,047 --> 02:59:09,598
[SPEAKER_06]: First, we talked a great deal about the Columbus second grade and bringing in a second teacher because of the unique circumstances that had happened, but I don't see that reflected in a split or have we brought in a second teacher?

1854
02:59:10,692 --> 02:59:16,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, there's a second teacher at the Columbus second grade and there's a second teacher at the Brooks third grade.

1855
02:59:17,074 --> 02:59:19,595
[SPEAKER_09]: I can alter that chart for you to reflect that.

1856
02:59:19,996 --> 02:59:20,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1857
02:59:20,296 --> 02:59:24,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they working in unison or have each taken a portion of the students?

1858
02:59:25,498 --> 02:59:27,518
[SPEAKER_09]: To be honest, I believe it's a little bit of both.

1859
02:59:28,219 --> 02:59:38,443
[SPEAKER_09]: Member van de Kloot, I know that right now they're team teaching, but I think in terms of parent communication, report card grading and things like that, they may have,

1860
02:59:40,950 --> 02:59:50,018
[SPEAKER_09]: factored that down just a little bit more, but I know that it is more of a team, a co-teaching situation at both of those grade levels.

1861
02:59:50,399 --> 02:59:55,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, especially as the students had begun, that actually makes a lot of sense.

1862
02:59:56,904 --> 03:00:00,948
[SPEAKER_06]: Has the feedback from parents and students been positive?

1863
03:00:02,129 --> 03:00:02,990
[SPEAKER_06]: So far, yes.

1864
03:00:03,010 --> 03:00:04,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1865
03:00:05,459 --> 03:00:16,074
[SPEAKER_06]: The second question I had, and I just wanted to refer to it, is at the time when we discussed it two weeks ago, I had brought up the issue that you referenced that needing to change

1866
03:00:16,918 --> 03:00:31,688
[SPEAKER_06]: some of the specialists, and I was quite concerned about that because I know for my own grandchild how important those specialists are to him, and were they changed, it would cause him great stress.

1867
03:00:31,969 --> 03:00:36,652
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was very concerned when I had received some emails about that.

1868
03:00:36,672 --> 03:00:38,053
[SPEAKER_06]: One in particular stood out.

1869
03:00:39,454 --> 03:00:40,915
[SPEAKER_06]: I haven't received any out,

1870
03:00:43,076 --> 03:00:44,357
[SPEAKER_06]: input after that.

1871
03:00:44,497 --> 03:00:59,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hoping that means that the new specialists have quickly, the kids have quickly adjusted, but that was something that was unexpected and I'm not totally sure whether it was, I know it hadn't been communicated to us, so I didn't understand it was happening.

1872
03:01:01,429 --> 03:01:06,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we stable at this point with the specialists and are you getting any other feedback about that?

1873
03:01:08,205 --> 03:01:11,006
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I have not at this moment.

1874
03:01:11,267 --> 03:01:23,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that as I mentioned in the presentation and just to kind of reiterate, first of all, at all levels, both the hybrid and the remote, it's Medford Public Schools employees.

1875
03:01:23,893 --> 03:01:27,995
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just there may have been a shift for some of the remote academy students that

1876
03:01:28,958 --> 03:01:35,562
[SPEAKER_09]: they had shifted from their school-based specialists to district-wide Medford public school specialists.

1877
03:01:37,003 --> 03:01:39,985
[SPEAKER_09]: It was not a unilateral shift.

1878
03:01:40,065 --> 03:01:57,217
[SPEAKER_09]: So some classrooms, some students were able to retain some of their specialists, but as we staggered in more classrooms at the hybrid, there also was a need to shift some staff around just to make sure that students were receiving

1879
03:01:58,073 --> 03:02:00,195
[SPEAKER_09]: specialist education from teachers.

1880
03:02:01,877 --> 03:02:02,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1881
03:02:02,417 --> 03:02:16,170
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, you know, in my own, obviously, I don't think it's the ideal situation by any, you know, stretch, but I think that what I'm hearing is really it's what you had to do in very unfortunate circumstances.

1882
03:02:17,265 --> 03:02:20,186
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I keep on putting that, trying to put that into perspective.

1883
03:02:20,286 --> 03:02:28,728
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, today we had to, we were asked to submit videos for, to the McGlynn for their Medford Pride Day.

1884
03:02:28,788 --> 03:02:44,691
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the things, words I had to use was flexible and proud of our students for being flexible, because I think that's such a key here and something that we have to keep on patting them on the back for, and also to our teachers and staff too about,

1885
03:02:46,232 --> 03:02:53,638
[SPEAKER_06]: striving to keep that flexibility as we work through these times.

1886
03:02:54,138 --> 03:02:55,119
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, thank you very much.

1887
03:02:55,139 --> 03:02:56,100
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1888
03:02:56,120 --> 03:02:56,580
[SPEAKER_09]: Much agreed.

1889
03:02:56,620 --> 03:03:10,091
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to mention too that, of course, it's not what we wanted to happen or originally anticipated happening, but it is why we also gave some advanced notice in that shift.

1890
03:03:10,151 --> 03:03:12,413
[SPEAKER_09]: It was mentioned in the superintendent's Friday memo.

1891
03:03:13,423 --> 03:03:16,164
[SPEAKER_09]: teachers were well informed about that shift.

1892
03:03:16,184 --> 03:03:21,466
[SPEAKER_09]: So they were working with the students about two weeks prior to the transition.

1893
03:03:21,846 --> 03:03:31,549
[SPEAKER_09]: And in some cases, I know that teachers had joined up so that the students were able to kind of put a face to the teacher before that shift happened.

1894
03:03:31,610 --> 03:03:31,810
[SPEAKER_09]: So.

1895
03:03:31,950 --> 03:03:32,950
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's good to know.

1896
03:03:33,010 --> 03:03:33,830
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not know that.

1897
03:03:33,870 --> 03:03:34,330
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

1898
03:03:34,430 --> 03:03:35,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Great to hear.

1899
03:03:35,211 --> 03:03:35,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Suzanne.

1900
03:03:36,531 --> 03:03:36,831
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1901
03:03:39,092 --> 03:03:39,452
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1902
03:03:39,732 --> 03:03:40,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

1903
03:03:40,533 --> 03:03:41,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, Member Graham.

1904
03:03:47,037 --> 03:03:47,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're on mute.

1905
03:03:48,238 --> 03:03:48,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

1906
03:03:50,420 --> 03:03:59,086
[SPEAKER_07]: My understanding is that the vast majority of remote kids at the elementary level experience changes, not just maybe some, but that almost all.

1907
03:03:59,266 --> 03:04:00,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that true?

1908
03:04:00,187 --> 03:04:04,691
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say it probably is a majority, but not all.

1909
03:04:05,531 --> 03:04:05,872
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1910
03:04:06,552 --> 03:04:07,813
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, I

1911
03:04:10,890 --> 03:04:15,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that change was met with a lot of favor by remote families.

1912
03:04:16,932 --> 03:04:28,535
[SPEAKER_07]: I have heard people say that part of the reason why this shift is happening is to provide capacity in the buildings to cover classes that aren't being able to be taught in the building like music.

1913
03:04:28,995 --> 03:04:37,537
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're using specialists to support proctoring essentially and taking, so taking

1914
03:04:38,889 --> 03:04:44,790
[SPEAKER_07]: away known teachers from remote students to proctor other specialist classes.

1915
03:04:44,990 --> 03:04:46,051
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that happening?

1916
03:04:47,491 --> 03:04:59,993
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the beginning, there were some instances where that was happening, but we have since been hiring, as the superintendent has mentioned, we've since been hiring monitors for situations such as that.

1917
03:05:00,434 --> 03:05:03,554
[SPEAKER_09]: And that is not the reason why we had to make that shift.

1918
03:05:03,954 --> 03:05:06,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of the reason why we had to make that shift was for

1919
03:05:08,100 --> 03:05:16,180
[SPEAKER_09]: not only to make sure every student was able to have a specialist educator and not have asynchronous work, but also for

1920
03:05:18,347 --> 03:05:43,928
[SPEAKER_09]: When we staggered in based on COVID parameters, based on looking at all of cohort A populations and making sure that cohort numbers did not increase based on the size of the six foot social distancing, there were some situations in which pre-COVID, some of our cohort A students would have been able to integrate with cohort B and C students.

1921
03:05:44,268 --> 03:05:47,451
[SPEAKER_09]: And in this scenario, they were unable to

1922
03:05:49,052 --> 03:05:52,173
[SPEAKER_09]: join a cohort B or C class for specialists.

1923
03:05:52,553 --> 03:06:07,518
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are some situations in which certain cohorts based on enrollment numbers for cohort A had to have their own specialist time, which increased the number of specialist blocks and therefore we had to shift the specialist staff.

1924
03:06:07,538 --> 03:06:10,699
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1925
03:06:11,339 --> 03:06:15,681
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've heard the administration say a couple of times,

1926
03:06:18,455 --> 03:06:22,677
[SPEAKER_07]: that they have or haven't received feedback.

1927
03:06:22,797 --> 03:06:36,904
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just curious how you are soliciting that feedback because I actually heard today from a number of parents who in some of the larger classrooms are pretty disenchanted with the experience that they're having.

1928
03:06:36,944 --> 03:06:41,947
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just curious what actions the administration is taking to solicit input.

1929
03:06:45,277 --> 03:06:59,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you're referring to like a formal survey that has not been conducted at this time, I'm more than willing to have a conversation about that and conduct a formal survey to get that specific data.

1930
03:07:01,145 --> 03:07:11,891
[SPEAKER_09]: My right now, what I'm saying that on is based on my conversations with principals and staff and referring to any emails I may have personally received.

1931
03:07:14,605 --> 03:07:28,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I think as a district, we need to think carefully about how we are reaching out to families who are part of this educational equation in a way that they never have been before.

1932
03:07:28,169 --> 03:07:38,572
[SPEAKER_07]: And we talk about that a lot, but I'd like to see us actually engage families in this discussion in a more

1933
03:07:39,580 --> 03:07:47,492
[SPEAKER_07]: meaningful way so that we can do more than just assume that because we haven't received a complaint that everything is that all is well.

1934
03:07:49,007 --> 03:07:51,708
[SPEAKER_07]: because I think in some cases, all is actually well.

1935
03:07:51,868 --> 03:08:00,971
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think in other cases, the reasons why all isn't well are fixable and just completely unaddressed because no one is reaching out.

1936
03:08:01,111 --> 03:08:14,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I've heard like at the middle school level, people say sometimes they're kids who are at home, whether they're at home because they're cohort B or cohort C or cohort D, can't hear what's going on in the classroom.

1937
03:08:16,459 --> 03:08:22,682
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, but I don't know that we have any sort of window into what those, what those issues are.

1938
03:08:23,103 --> 03:08:25,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, in that case, it's pretty fixable.

1939
03:08:25,164 --> 03:08:26,504
[SPEAKER_07]: We're field testing microphones.

1940
03:08:26,965 --> 03:08:30,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Hopefully we have a fix on the way, but there's, there's other stuff like that.

1941
03:08:30,487 --> 03:08:31,547
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so fixable.

1942
03:08:31,627 --> 03:08:39,431
[SPEAKER_07]: If we take the time to ask the questions and I'm just concerned that we're not, we are not asking the questions and maybe that's a survey.

1943
03:08:39,531 --> 03:08:40,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's not.

1944
03:08:41,768 --> 03:09:04,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's something else entirely, but I would like to see us actually engage the other adults that are responsible for education right now because they have no choice, obviously, in understanding from them what they're seeing and how that might help us all continue to improve.

1945
03:09:08,389 --> 03:09:08,969
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1946
03:09:09,169 --> 03:09:09,850
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau?

1947
03:09:12,255 --> 03:09:14,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, actually, I see Member McLaughlin's hands up.

1948
03:09:15,796 --> 03:09:17,637
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want me to read those now or wait till the end?

1949
03:09:17,657 --> 03:09:17,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

1950
03:09:19,878 --> 03:09:21,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin, and then we can read the emails.

1951
03:09:22,559 --> 03:09:23,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

1952
03:09:24,740 --> 03:09:37,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I also just wanted to just mention if we could, you know, if there's gonna be sort of a district-wide decision, such as with the specialist,

1953
03:09:38,845 --> 03:09:44,707
[SPEAKER_08]: I found out about that as I think most of my colleagues did via social media.

1954
03:09:45,408 --> 03:09:53,951
[SPEAKER_08]: And I didn't have a response really for the constituent that was asking the question right then because I wasn't really clear on what had actually occurred.

1955
03:09:54,071 --> 03:10:06,935
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that because everybody is so overtaxed right now with their job responsibilities, and I understand that, and at home responsibilities and everything else that we're dealing with, that it's been really

1956
03:10:08,559 --> 03:10:14,071
[SPEAKER_08]: even more difficult to communicate across district and with each other.

1957
03:10:14,111 --> 03:10:16,536
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess I would ask that if there's

1958
03:10:17,584 --> 03:10:22,328
[SPEAKER_08]: sort of a district-wide decision that it also be communicated.

1959
03:10:22,829 --> 03:10:38,001
[SPEAKER_08]: So for instance, one might say when there's a district-wide decision, you would know because it's a decision that's an email's going to all the principals, for example, that the school committee would also be included in those emails so that we could just know in advance.

1960
03:10:38,161 --> 03:10:44,387
[SPEAKER_08]: And if we have questions, then we can come to you not reactively, but proactively.

1961
03:10:44,907 --> 03:10:50,349
[SPEAKER_08]: So respectfully, I would just ask that, you know, we be included in those instances as well, if possible.

1962
03:10:50,869 --> 03:10:51,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1963
03:10:51,770 --> 03:10:52,290
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1964
03:10:52,490 --> 03:10:52,870
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1965
03:10:55,171 --> 03:10:55,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1966
03:10:57,011 --> 03:10:57,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

1967
03:10:58,592 --> 03:10:58,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1968
03:10:59,852 --> 03:11:05,074
[SPEAKER_16]: This question is from Amanda, excuse me, Angela Moore on Bynestream.

1969
03:11:05,835 --> 03:11:12,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Dear school committee members at MPS Central Administration, first and foremost, I want to thank you all for devoting so much time to our school district

1970
03:11:13,413 --> 03:11:16,894
[SPEAKER_16]: as we discuss remote learning and the Remote Learning Academy.

1971
03:11:20,435 --> 03:11:22,995
[SPEAKER_16]: That did not materialize for our middle and high school students.

1972
03:11:23,055 --> 03:11:32,777
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't help but feel a sense that the fully remote cohort, remote students, whatever label they now go by, are no longer a priority to the administration.

1973
03:11:33,237 --> 03:11:39,179
[SPEAKER_16]: I am in no way stating that teachers are not doing their very best to engage and teach all students, remote and hybrid.

1974
03:11:39,739 --> 03:11:41,139
[SPEAKER_16]: Teachers are shifting and pivoting

1975
03:11:42,324 --> 03:11:47,029
[SPEAKER_16]: their teaching as quickly as they can and attempting to make it go smoothly for all students.

1976
03:11:47,829 --> 03:11:54,556
[SPEAKER_16]: It's no secret Medford was way behind other districts when it came to being able to implement return to an in-person learning.

1977
03:11:56,778 --> 03:12:05,407
[SPEAKER_16]: As parents, we have made, excuse me, we made decisions with little to no information about what in-person learning would look like or how the buildings would be safe.

1978
03:12:06,104 --> 03:12:11,347
[SPEAKER_16]: The focus clearly became getting the students that chose hybrid back into the building, and rightly so.

1979
03:12:11,848 --> 03:12:14,889
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd just like to remind you all that the remote students are still out there.

1980
03:12:15,350 --> 03:12:21,514
[SPEAKER_16]: They are still doing their very best to stay on track, find a way to feel like they are part of school.

1981
03:12:22,214 --> 03:12:30,699
[SPEAKER_16]: They have made a social sacrifice, and from my perspective in doing so, they are hyper aware of the need to maintain safety protocols.

1982
03:12:31,280 --> 03:12:33,441
[SPEAKER_16]: These students want to be back in school as well,

1983
03:12:34,083 --> 03:12:40,526
[SPEAKER_16]: and they are the ones that are acutely aware of the repercussions of not wearing a mask and not social distancing.

1984
03:12:41,146 --> 03:12:56,853
[SPEAKER_16]: Given the confusion in our district regarding our own metrics and the new state metrics that seem to indicate remote should only be an option if our dumpster fire moves up a creek without a paddle, changing my students' learning model at this time seems uninformed.

1985
03:12:57,754 --> 03:13:00,355
[SPEAKER_16]: I am not alone as a remote parent

1986
03:13:00,658 --> 03:13:06,621
[SPEAKER_16]: feeling the pressure from not only MPS administration, but also from state officials to send their children back.

1987
03:13:07,241 --> 03:13:08,542
[SPEAKER_16]: Our concerns are still valid.

1988
03:13:08,682 --> 03:13:14,645
[SPEAKER_16]: Our choices are still made based on what we feel is best for our students and family.

1989
03:13:14,985 --> 03:13:24,189
[SPEAKER_16]: I ask that you recognize the value in our decisions and work to make sure the remote learning is adequately supported and remains robust and able to evolve.

1990
03:13:24,530 --> 03:13:25,710
[SPEAKER_16]: Sincerely, Angela Moore.

1991
03:13:26,851 --> 03:13:27,251
[SPEAKER_17]: Madam Mayor.

1992
03:13:29,713 --> 03:13:32,035
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd really like to thank Mr. Moore for her comments.

1993
03:13:32,095 --> 03:13:54,016
[SPEAKER_17]: I would like to say, though, that there isn't a day that goes by that I'm not thinking about our remote students, our fully remote students, and trying to think of ways to make their experience better, from bringing in new and better technology, hello, Nev, to bringing in ways to engage them in better with their peers.

1994
03:13:56,068 --> 03:14:04,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, please, to any parent out there, feel no pressure as to sending your child back to school.

1995
03:14:04,414 --> 03:14:16,504
[SPEAKER_17]: This remote option allows you the choice in the best manner possible to still have your children be connected to Medford students.

1996
03:14:17,645 --> 03:14:20,907
[SPEAKER_17]: The reason we are doing this is because we are in a global pandemic.

1997
03:14:22,572 --> 03:14:31,839
[SPEAKER_17]: We are in a sea of unknown and as parents, you need to make the choice that you feel is best for your child.

1998
03:14:33,220 --> 03:14:43,788
[SPEAKER_17]: We are doing the best that we can to provide as many options as possible to re-engage students and to bring them back to school if they and their families feel comfortable.

1999
03:14:44,789 --> 03:14:50,573
[SPEAKER_17]: If you are not comfortable because we are in the middle of a global pandemic that is at last count claimed

2000
03:14:51,186 --> 03:15:01,714
[SPEAKER_17]: that has infected 11 million Americans and increasing daily and killed 245,000 at the last count that I saw, I put no pressure on you.

2001
03:15:02,454 --> 03:15:15,644
[SPEAKER_17]: I would say for the first time in the history of academics, we wanna make sure that students are engaged, but there is no pressure to have you send your kids back into the building if it is not what you feel is best for your kids.

2002
03:15:17,125 --> 03:15:19,227
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that some people may think that

2003
03:15:19,688 --> 03:15:24,890
[SPEAKER_17]: We're just towing a party line and really beating the drum to get kids back in.

2004
03:15:25,530 --> 03:15:32,733
[SPEAKER_17]: We're beating the drum to get kids back in who are comfortable and who can socially distance and can do all those things.

2005
03:15:33,913 --> 03:15:35,634
[SPEAKER_17]: And their families are comfortable too.

2006
03:15:35,854 --> 03:15:40,455
[SPEAKER_17]: But we also want to provide the best options possible for all of our kids.

2007
03:15:42,696 --> 03:15:43,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

2008
03:15:44,997 --> 03:15:45,677
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Farah.

2009
03:15:45,737 --> 03:15:46,578
[SPEAKER_16]: I have another email.

2010
03:15:47,378 --> 03:15:47,498
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

2011
03:15:49,104 --> 03:15:50,625
[SPEAKER_16]: This one is, good evening.

2012
03:15:51,385 --> 03:15:54,407
[SPEAKER_16]: This is from Kristen Gleona, Norwich Circle.

2013
03:15:54,907 --> 03:15:55,367
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening.

2014
03:15:55,407 --> 03:16:01,070
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you please provide the current number of teachers granted permission to reverse remote teach as of today?

2015
03:16:01,090 --> 03:16:15,017
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have the exact number and it is a relatively fluid situation because there are instances in which teachers are authorized to work remotely on a short term basis.

2016
03:16:15,807 --> 03:16:24,938
[SPEAKER_15]: And so that what the number is this week, it could be it could be different next week I have previously I believe provided the committee with an update as to all of the.

2017
03:16:27,961 --> 03:16:28,902
[SPEAKER_15]: All of the.

2018
03:16:30,424 --> 03:16:33,828
[SPEAKER_15]: authorizations as of like maybe 10 days ago and.

2019
03:16:35,358 --> 03:17:01,405
[SPEAKER_15]: there have been very few changes up until that point, because all of that analysis was through all staff with the exception of the high school, but additional requests do come in, which is frankly part of why I sort of took the moment earlier during Dr. Cushing's presentation to point out that while our, excuse me, our analysis is ongoing,

2020
03:17:02,125 --> 03:17:12,929
[SPEAKER_15]: and we will review each request and we'll analyze it, there is a large continuum or wide continuum of the basis for these requests.

2021
03:17:13,549 --> 03:17:24,913
[SPEAKER_15]: And some, as Dr. Cushing said, it's a statutory entitlement and the analysis concludes that clearly this person is entitled to this accommodation based on the context in which you're operating.

2022
03:17:25,613 --> 03:17:30,075
[SPEAKER_15]: In other instances, it's essentially a preference that a person is expressing and

2023
03:17:32,261 --> 03:17:48,608
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, we're weighing the generally valid concerns that employees are raising against the very compelling interest that the district has in affording students in-person instruction when a family has chosen to participate in the hybrid plan.

2024
03:17:48,668 --> 03:18:00,994
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wanna say the number's in the 20s, okay, in terms of the actual accommodations that have been granted, but it is fluid, it does change, and I'd have to review the numbers to give an exact figure.

2025
03:18:05,907 --> 03:18:06,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2026
03:18:07,028 --> 03:18:09,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

2027
03:18:09,909 --> 03:18:16,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave, when you say the numbers in the 20s, that's across elementary and middle, or does that include the high school?

2028
03:18:16,834 --> 03:18:18,735
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be across elementary and middle.

2029
03:18:19,195 --> 03:18:19,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

2030
03:18:20,376 --> 03:18:25,539
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know that it would be out of the 20s if we include the high school though, because that analysis isn't complete.

2031
03:18:27,020 --> 03:18:31,543
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think as I say that the 20s may include some non-teaching personnel as well.

2032
03:18:32,123 --> 03:18:34,425
[SPEAKER_15]: So the actual teachers are probably more in the,

2033
03:18:35,312 --> 03:18:36,533
[SPEAKER_15]: teens, I think.

2034
03:18:36,713 --> 03:18:39,414
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, I'd have to go back and look at the at the chart.

2035
03:18:40,934 --> 03:18:41,655
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.

2036
03:18:43,715 --> 03:18:44,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2037
03:18:46,877 --> 03:18:48,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the report as well.

2038
03:18:48,697 --> 03:18:51,078
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, the old business.

2039
03:18:53,699 --> 03:18:54,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Communications.

2040
03:18:57,486 --> 03:18:58,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor, can I ask a quick question?

2041
03:19:00,528 --> 03:19:08,695
[SPEAKER_07]: We didn't cover this during Joan's presentation, but in our packet, there was something that said update regarding plan for most vulnerable students.

2042
03:19:09,355 --> 03:19:13,258
[SPEAKER_07]: And it referenced a contingency plan, but I didn't see it attached in our packet.

2043
03:19:13,378 --> 03:19:15,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I just saw what looked like a cover memo.

2044
03:19:17,061 --> 03:19:18,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I miss a document?

2045
03:19:20,003 --> 03:19:21,104
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it was just the memo.

2046
03:19:22,625 --> 03:19:24,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Is a contingency plan forthcoming?

2047
03:19:25,135 --> 03:19:28,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's explained in the narrative that I gave.

2048
03:19:30,980 --> 03:19:33,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see a contingency plan in the memo.

2049
03:19:33,302 --> 03:19:37,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Students remain in person as long as we possibly can.

2050
03:19:37,726 --> 03:19:50,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're committed to having our most vulnerable students continue in receiving the in-person services unless we're told that schools need to close,

2051
03:19:51,657 --> 03:20:00,943
[SPEAKER_02]: We have received guidance from the commissioner and also Russell Johnson who said we need to still provide in person services.

2052
03:20:01,463 --> 03:20:02,424
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's our goal.

2053
03:20:03,644 --> 03:20:08,687
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be the contingency plan that they continue to receive in person services.

2054
03:20:13,012 --> 03:20:17,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, I know this came out of comments that I made, maybe I should be more clear.

2055
03:20:17,255 --> 03:20:26,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to make a motion that a contingency plan be created in the event that we have to send our most vulnerable students remote en masse.

2056
03:20:27,103 --> 03:20:29,905
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the contingency plan that I believe that we need to have.

2057
03:20:31,927 --> 03:20:32,267
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

2058
03:20:39,273 --> 03:20:42,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I ask for clarification or some more detail

2059
03:20:44,538 --> 03:20:52,783
[SPEAKER_08]: through the chair, member Graham, can you help maybe define that even a little bit more clearly?

2060
03:20:52,803 --> 03:20:57,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Because there's so many scenarios in that case.

2061
03:20:57,907 --> 03:20:59,708
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you saying that if

2062
03:21:00,664 --> 03:21:16,613
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in a situation where it is absolutely out of the question that our most vulnerable students are receiving in person services because even with you know the outside districts and other things that I've been looking at where other folks are entirely remote.

2063
03:21:18,274 --> 03:21:26,119
[SPEAKER_08]: our most vulnerable students are still receiving in-person services because of the controlled environment of the small number of students and the small number of staff.

2064
03:21:26,179 --> 03:21:33,225
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually is very palatable, I guess, to be able to control the scenario.

2065
03:21:33,825 --> 03:21:34,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if

2066
03:21:35,672 --> 03:21:42,513
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't done an extensive search, but I don't know of any other districts that are not having our most vulnerable students in person.

2067
03:21:42,553 --> 03:22:03,617
[SPEAKER_08]: So are you saying that in the scenario where it's absolutely out of the question that most vulnerable students, even though everybody is saying they're gonna do everything they can to ensure, even if everybody else has to go remote, that these students are still receiving some variation of in-person services, you want a scenario or a discussion of,

2068
03:22:04,687 --> 03:22:25,882
[SPEAKER_07]: what the plan is if that is entirely not an option is is that yes this specific yes yes so and and i know that every student has their own plan that is not the plan that i'm asking for i believe that as a district we need to have a framework that says that if if

2069
03:22:27,057 --> 03:22:29,638
[SPEAKER_07]: a whole building has to be shut down, for example.

2070
03:22:29,758 --> 03:22:33,718
[SPEAKER_07]: Like that could be a reason why our most vulnerable have to go home.

2071
03:22:33,778 --> 03:22:36,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe there's something that has happened in a building.

2072
03:22:38,019 --> 03:22:43,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there services that can transition to Zoom seamlessly because we have that experience?

2073
03:22:43,941 --> 03:22:46,401
[SPEAKER_07]: We did it in the summer during ESY.

2074
03:22:46,841 --> 03:22:53,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there certain services that just simply can't be done that way and we want to find alternative ways to continue to conduct them in person?

2075
03:22:54,936 --> 03:22:58,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So to me, it's not about like what every individual student needs.

2076
03:22:58,937 --> 03:23:08,621
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about the services we're providing and which of those services would we need to sort of protect in some way so that they can continue to happen in person?

2077
03:23:09,041 --> 03:23:12,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Which of the services can we transition and what is our plan?

2078
03:23:13,223 --> 03:23:20,105
[SPEAKER_07]: The entire point and purpose of having a contingency plan is that when that thing happens that you're not

2079
03:23:20,545 --> 03:23:33,875
[SPEAKER_07]: planning for, like sending all remote kids home, that you don't start from that day and have to work to create a plan and a structure and a way to get things going again.

2080
03:23:33,895 --> 03:23:42,202
[SPEAKER_07]: So the whole point of having a contingency plan is to have a jump on whatever that thing is that you're not planning for, so that you know what to do.

2081
03:23:42,853 --> 03:24:03,284
[SPEAKER_07]: And all I'm asking is that we think about these students, and frankly, how much we don't know about how this will impact all our students, but particularly our most vulnerable in the long run, and have some level of a plan in the eventuality, or maybe not, that we have to send everybody home.

2082
03:24:03,304 --> 03:24:09,187
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think lots and lots of people think it's an inevitability that we will all end up back at home.

2083
03:24:09,727 --> 03:24:11,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether you think that or not,

2084
03:24:11,887 --> 03:24:19,214
[SPEAKER_07]: The only downside of having a contingency plan is that you spent time thinking through what the contingency plan is.

2085
03:24:19,554 --> 03:24:23,738
[SPEAKER_07]: There's absolutely no downside to being prepared and I hope we would never have to use it.

2086
03:24:24,239 --> 03:24:28,563
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we do, I don't wanna be delayed in providing services to these students.

2087
03:24:31,086 --> 03:24:32,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I speak to that for a moment?

2088
03:24:34,108 --> 03:24:34,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

2089
03:24:34,329 --> 03:24:35,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Bowen and member McLaughlin.

2090
03:24:36,555 --> 03:24:42,481
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have had specific situations at the high school level where we've had to move students.

2091
03:24:43,322 --> 03:24:49,127
[SPEAKER_02]: A student has had to go remote or a classroom has had to go remote, and we have done that seamlessly.

2092
03:24:49,267 --> 03:24:57,496
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think with the middle school and the high school, they're able to provide the services both in person and remote at the same time.

2093
03:24:57,916 --> 03:25:00,879
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did have to move four classrooms at the high school.

2094
03:25:01,319 --> 03:25:03,741
[SPEAKER_02]: to fully remote during the quarantine period.

2095
03:25:04,121 --> 03:25:15,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Those students continue to receive their special education services, their electives seamlessly, so there was no stoppage of them getting the services that they required.

2096
03:25:16,210 --> 03:25:23,255
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would continue, but I think the difficulty is there's so many situations that could happen, planning for every single situation,

2097
03:25:23,775 --> 03:25:43,645
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are prepared that if we need to go remote, students have a specific schedule that says what time their classes are, when their specific, could be related services, therapies, Wilson reading, whatever it may be is scheduled, that those would continue remotely, if that makes sense.

2098
03:25:44,930 --> 03:25:58,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it does for some services, but the value of a contingency plan is to have a full catalog of what your services are so you know what the specific plan is for each and every one of the services that you have to provide to support students.

2099
03:25:59,278 --> 03:26:09,044
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I think perhaps that is the contingency plan for some number of services, but it's not the whole contingency plan, or at least it shouldn't be.

2100
03:26:09,064 --> 03:26:12,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

2101
03:26:13,803 --> 03:26:26,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that I appreciate member Graham's wanting to have a clear contingency plan for this population.

2102
03:26:26,646 --> 03:26:38,129
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also think that, you know, having been involved in special education for the past 12 years and on a number of different levels is that,

2103
03:26:39,284 --> 03:26:43,086
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, it's such a highly litigated field, number one.

2104
03:26:43,246 --> 03:26:49,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, it is very much at the individual level.

2105
03:26:50,110 --> 03:27:05,700
[SPEAKER_08]: And so every single time, believe me, I have gone both to the state and national level trying to create some systemic consistency around some of these bigger issues and have always gotten the response that,

2106
03:27:06,797 --> 03:27:10,300
[SPEAKER_08]: The catch 22 it here is that it is very individualized.

2107
03:27:10,760 --> 03:27:18,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, in, you know, to the director of people services perspective if you're looking at 300 or 800 or whatever students 300 in the.

2108
03:27:22,035 --> 03:27:34,458
[SPEAKER_08]: in the current cohort A, but if you're looking at 800 students and you're thinking about the contingency plan for the 800 at an individualized level, it's just like sort of an impossible question to ask.

2109
03:27:34,918 --> 03:27:40,400
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I'm saying is if you can maybe help clarify with Ms.

2110
03:27:40,420 --> 03:27:44,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowen, either offline or in this situation or whatever,

2111
03:27:45,457 --> 03:27:50,238
[SPEAKER_08]: some maybe specific questions that you want answers to, that could be a little bit more helpful.

2112
03:27:50,278 --> 03:27:58,400
[SPEAKER_08]: But otherwise, it's sort of like throwing the whole thing up there and saying, give me a contingency plan for 800 different scenarios for each different student in every different setting.

2113
03:27:58,420 --> 03:27:59,481
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just impossible.

2114
03:27:59,501 --> 03:28:00,241
[SPEAKER_08]: You can't.

2115
03:28:00,741 --> 03:28:08,083
[SPEAKER_08]: So if maybe we could be a little bit more specific in some of the formulations of the questions, that could be a little bit more helpful.

2116
03:28:08,163 --> 03:28:10,944
[SPEAKER_08]: But to the legal aspect point,

2117
03:28:11,891 --> 03:28:20,596
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, Joan Bowen's responsibility as the Director of Pupil Services is to meet every single one of those students individualized education needs.

2118
03:28:22,117 --> 03:28:30,943
[SPEAKER_07]: So to be clear, I would like evidence that the district is prepared to continue to meet our legal obligations

2119
03:28:31,822 --> 03:28:35,445
[SPEAKER_07]: if and when we have to go full remote.

2120
03:28:35,685 --> 03:28:45,393
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like some evidence to give me confidence as a member of this school committee that we are prepared to do right by these students.

2121
03:28:45,994 --> 03:28:47,716
[SPEAKER_07]: even if the unforeseen happens.

2122
03:28:48,236 --> 03:28:50,118
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I think that's helpful.

2123
03:28:51,479 --> 03:28:54,521
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that is the overarching question, right?

2124
03:28:54,582 --> 03:28:56,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, are we prepared to do that?

2125
03:28:56,363 --> 03:29:02,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we provide assurances to the families of these students that their services will continue

2126
03:29:03,892 --> 03:29:11,157
[SPEAKER_07]: and that it won't take us weeks or months to do that, that we will be prepared seamlessly to transition in one way or another.

2127
03:29:11,177 --> 03:29:20,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like some evidence to tell me that, and this particular report made me think I was missing a document because it doesn't provide any specifics.

2128
03:29:21,323 --> 03:29:22,944
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is what I'm looking for.

2129
03:29:22,964 --> 03:29:26,106
[SPEAKER_08]: Through the chair, if I may.

2130
03:29:26,126 --> 03:29:28,728
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin, then Member Ruseau.

2131
03:29:29,212 --> 03:29:29,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2132
03:29:29,552 --> 03:29:30,873
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just say that's very helpful.

2133
03:29:31,053 --> 03:29:38,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that is a very helpful clarification because the reality is that is our legal obligation, period.

2134
03:29:38,898 --> 03:29:40,199
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not an option.

2135
03:29:40,719 --> 03:29:46,323
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm sure that the staff can support what that is.

2136
03:29:46,383 --> 03:29:49,985
[SPEAKER_08]: But if people have individual education plans that require

2137
03:29:50,599 --> 03:29:54,300
[SPEAKER_08]: supports and services, even in a global pandemic, they have to be provided.

2138
03:29:54,340 --> 03:30:08,405
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, there's a lot going on with like Mass Advocates for Children and other disability organizations that are talking about what are they doing around compensatory services if the student didn't receive in-person versus remote or as many back in the spring.

2139
03:30:08,486 --> 03:30:12,167
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are those nuances, but yeah, that's our responsibility.

2140
03:30:12,207 --> 03:30:13,968
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's perfectly reasonable.

2141
03:30:16,050 --> 03:30:27,394
[SPEAKER_08]: In that sense, when you say, can you show us evidence that you will meet the legal obligations of these individualized education plans of these X number of students in a scenario that is remote?

2142
03:30:27,654 --> 03:30:29,255
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a reasonable question.

2143
03:30:29,695 --> 03:30:30,995
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for the clarification.

2144
03:30:36,517 --> 03:30:38,098
[SPEAKER_10]: So then Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

2145
03:30:39,278 --> 03:30:39,658
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2146
03:30:41,119 --> 03:30:43,660
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess I was even gonna go up a little higher level.

2147
03:30:45,678 --> 03:31:05,821
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, if the call comes in from Marianne or the governor has a press conference at 11am, I want, I mean, this isn't even for any specific student population, I want to see a document that says, this is the exact order, who's going to do what, what are the

2148
03:31:06,358 --> 03:31:16,142
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I don't mean the actual contents of the communications, a line item that says the shutting the schools down email will be sent, the shutting the schools robocall will be sent and Peter will do it.

2149
03:31:16,582 --> 03:31:19,704
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, a plan is something you execute.

2150
03:31:20,984 --> 03:31:33,909
[SPEAKER_16]: So there are probably going to be 100, 200, 300 things that the superintendent and her staff need to figure out how to handle if there is a sudden shutdown.

2151
03:31:35,727 --> 03:31:45,048
[SPEAKER_16]: And all those items need to be in a list and they have to be, who's going to do them, what's the order, what's the priority, and you know,

2152
03:31:46,825 --> 03:31:55,071
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't have teachers reaching out to figure out how to adjust services for a student who's going to be full remote before they even found out that they're going to be full remote.

2153
03:31:55,111 --> 03:31:57,253
[SPEAKER_16]: So like the order of things really does matter.

2154
03:31:58,113 --> 03:32:03,337
[SPEAKER_16]: So I mean, I want to know that it's not like, oh, I forgot to do that, or I should have somebody do that.

2155
03:32:03,677 --> 03:32:07,220
[SPEAKER_16]: We can figure all those things out ahead of time so that the execution is as

2156
03:32:08,609 --> 03:32:09,689
[SPEAKER_16]: smooth as it can be.

2157
03:32:09,709 --> 03:32:19,351
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have any delusions that the dozens or hundreds of activities that have to occur in very little time are going to be done perfectly.

2158
03:32:19,451 --> 03:32:20,411
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not the goal.

2159
03:32:20,591 --> 03:32:28,873
[SPEAKER_16]: But having them laid out so that the staff just kind of goes on full-blown remote control, like automatic.

2160
03:32:29,573 --> 03:32:36,875
[SPEAKER_16]: This is what we have to do because the governor just called a press conference and shocks Maurice into like, oh my God, I guess that's that.

2161
03:32:38,218 --> 03:32:51,408
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just, that's for me, that's what I need to see to feel confident that if, or perhaps when that happens, it is not like in the spring, which did take us all kind of by surprise.

2162
03:32:51,548 --> 03:32:53,389
[SPEAKER_16]: So we needed a few days to do this.

2163
03:32:53,549 --> 03:32:55,731
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the first week was kind of a what's up.

2164
03:32:57,392 --> 03:33:02,556
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like it shouldn't take more than a half of a day to execute that plan.

2165
03:33:05,864 --> 03:33:13,007
[SPEAKER_16]: but it certainly is gonna take more than a half a day if we're not sure who's gonna do which part and when and what's the order.

2166
03:33:13,147 --> 03:33:15,168
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why I seconded that.

2167
03:33:16,669 --> 03:33:18,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

2168
03:33:18,878 --> 03:33:19,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2169
03:33:19,878 --> 03:33:23,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to, yes, it can be done.

2170
03:33:23,919 --> 03:33:45,583
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to assure the school committee and the listening audience that just like in September, when we prioritized our most vulnerable that were identified by the state as the population of students to serve, the 300 students that started our first cohort

2171
03:33:46,403 --> 03:33:55,453
[SPEAKER_03]: They would be based on the guidance we've received thus far that we will try our best, our due diligence to keep them in the longest.

2172
03:33:56,574 --> 03:34:00,418
[SPEAKER_03]: As everyone can see, as we're paying attention to what's happening in the news,

2173
03:34:01,946 --> 03:34:12,169
[SPEAKER_03]: the likelihood that the nation may have to eventually have some type of a shutdown, whether it's four weeks or six weeks, we do have to be prepared for that.

2174
03:34:13,330 --> 03:34:29,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if the school committee recalls, but in the spring, there was a ILP or Individualized Learning Plan that was a special modified plan for our students with disabilities to talk about services that they would receive

2175
03:34:30,615 --> 03:34:32,075
[SPEAKER_03]: during remote instruction.

2176
03:34:32,636 --> 03:34:35,096
[SPEAKER_03]: So our students do have updated plans.

2177
03:34:36,696 --> 03:34:44,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Our special educators that are working with students, I have to say that, you know, they all deserve golden crowns.

2178
03:34:45,158 --> 03:34:52,620
[SPEAKER_03]: They have been the most flexible because they came in first and they're kind of like the first ones to come in and they'll be the last ones to leave.

2179
03:34:54,322 --> 03:34:59,952
[SPEAKER_03]: But we will be able to say what it is but because of the experience that we had eight months ago.

2180
03:35:01,548 --> 03:35:06,613
[SPEAKER_03]: We had a lot of lessons that were learned and a lot has happened since then and now.

2181
03:35:08,034 --> 03:35:13,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Teachers, for example, now have updated technology to allow them to do the work.

2182
03:35:13,979 --> 03:35:16,962
[SPEAKER_03]: They have MacBooks, very powerful devices.

2183
03:35:18,323 --> 03:35:27,091
[SPEAKER_03]: We made a lot of strategic investments to improve teaching and learning and to make it a better experience for both students and for

2184
03:35:28,272 --> 03:35:29,473
[SPEAKER_03]: and also for teachers.

2185
03:35:29,973 --> 03:35:37,436
[SPEAKER_03]: But for our most vulnerable, we will be able to say what the plan is, and Ms.

2186
03:35:37,456 --> 03:35:51,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Bowen alluded that we've had test situations since school has started for our most vulnerable back in September, where we had to revert back to remote, and then the students returned.

2187
03:35:51,503 --> 03:35:55,245
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is frequent communication, whether it's by classroom,

2188
03:35:56,440 --> 03:36:00,604
[SPEAKER_03]: directly with parents and with all of the support services.

2189
03:36:00,624 --> 03:36:11,652
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just don't want people to think that we want anyone to slip through the cracks, but our most vulnerable students, we're aware that they have the greatest need.

2190
03:36:12,293 --> 03:36:16,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we have definitely tried to keep that front and center.

2191
03:36:17,357 --> 03:36:21,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can definitely work on trying, creating a document

2192
03:36:23,142 --> 03:36:25,943
[SPEAKER_03]: that will kind of outline what will happen.

2193
03:36:25,983 --> 03:36:35,545
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of the work that would be created in the contingency plan will be built upon the plans that were already produced and published during the summer.

2194
03:36:36,045 --> 03:36:41,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that work, a lot of that hard work that describes what happens, it's already there.

2195
03:36:42,066 --> 03:36:43,687
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just now creating it

2196
03:36:44,447 --> 03:36:51,953
[SPEAKER_03]: and putting it in a new document to have it identified as a contingency plan.

2197
03:36:52,173 --> 03:37:08,846
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just wanted to remind everyone that there is an individualized learning plan, an ILP, for all of our students with disability, not just the 300, the most vulnerable, but for our students

2198
03:37:09,907 --> 03:37:27,439
[SPEAKER_03]: all 800 plus students with disabilities that we will, you know, the special educators and all of the related service providers will refer to to provide continued support for those students.

2199
03:37:30,441 --> 03:37:30,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2200
03:37:31,682 --> 03:37:32,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2201
03:37:32,743 --> 03:37:33,443
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin?

2202
03:37:34,664 --> 03:37:38,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and as I'm thinking about the problem, I just sort of want to just

2203
03:37:39,640 --> 03:37:43,316
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess this is to member Rousseau's point as well, but I guess that, you know,

2204
03:37:44,925 --> 03:37:48,186
[SPEAKER_08]: The same could be said essentially of general education.

2205
03:37:48,226 --> 03:37:54,748
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, okay, so what is the contingency plan if 4,000 kids need to go remote, right?

2206
03:37:54,788 --> 03:37:56,088
[SPEAKER_08]: What are we doing for them?

2207
03:37:56,168 --> 03:37:59,909
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's the same scenario.

2208
03:38:00,889 --> 03:38:03,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And a contingency plan needs to be obviously created for that too.

2209
03:38:04,030 --> 03:38:11,272
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think what's different in this situation is obviously that these are more vulnerable populations that have

2210
03:38:11,732 --> 03:38:17,575
[SPEAKER_08]: very specific individualized needs around a lot of their services and their service presentation.

2211
03:38:17,595 --> 03:38:36,523
[SPEAKER_08]: But I guess I would, I always think about like, when you're asking something of either the disability community, or, you know, as a whole, even my own child, I would say, generally, is that something that you would ask of the non disabled community, which I'm sure it is in this scenario.

2212
03:38:37,003 --> 03:38:41,465
[SPEAKER_08]: But I just think that that's the way to think about things as well as like, how does this apply to everybody?

2213
03:38:41,818 --> 03:38:44,499
[SPEAKER_08]: right, so that we're thinking about everybody in that context.

2214
03:38:44,559 --> 03:38:46,399
[SPEAKER_08]: But anyway, thank you.

2215
03:38:50,600 --> 03:38:51,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2216
03:38:54,561 --> 03:38:56,482
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a motion on the floor with a second.

2217
03:38:56,502 --> 03:39:01,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Just remind me who seconded it.

2218
03:39:02,483 --> 03:39:03,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Ruseau.

2219
03:39:03,884 --> 03:39:05,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you repeat the motion, please?

2220
03:39:11,568 --> 03:39:33,262
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to make a motion that a contingency plan be developed to assure that we are prepared in the event of an emergency district-wide closure to continue to provide services to our most vulnerable population.

2221
03:39:39,625 --> 03:39:40,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Shall I call the roll?

2222
03:39:44,269 --> 03:39:44,849
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

2223
03:39:47,650 --> 03:39:49,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Should I call the roll, Brianna?

2224
03:39:49,650 --> 03:39:50,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, please.

2225
03:39:50,991 --> 03:39:51,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

2226
03:39:51,711 --> 03:39:52,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Jenny Graham?

2227
03:39:52,891 --> 03:39:53,171
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2228
03:39:54,012 --> 03:39:54,612
[SPEAKER_06]: Cathy Kreatz?

2229
03:39:55,332 --> 03:39:55,532
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2230
03:39:56,372 --> 03:39:57,273
[SPEAKER_06]: Melanie McLaughlin?

2231
03:39:58,653 --> 03:39:58,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2232
03:39:59,533 --> 03:40:00,173
[SPEAKER_06]: Mia Mastone?

2233
03:40:00,413 --> 03:40:00,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2234
03:40:01,654 --> 03:40:02,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Paul Rousseau?

2235
03:40:02,974 --> 03:40:03,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2236
03:40:03,674 --> 03:40:04,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Paulette Van der Kloot?

2237
03:40:04,554 --> 03:40:04,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

2238
03:40:04,975 --> 03:40:05,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

2239
03:40:06,115 --> 03:40:06,335
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2240
03:40:06,375 --> 03:40:07,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2241
03:40:07,835 --> 03:40:08,796
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion passes.

2242
03:40:08,816 --> 03:40:13,437
[SPEAKER_10]: New business, we have a presentation.

2243
03:40:14,135 --> 03:40:15,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for your patience.

2244
03:40:15,376 --> 03:40:27,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Presenters of the SNAP GAP report from the Medford Food Security Task Force, presented by Adrian Freden MSPH and Sarah McGibbon MSRD.

2245
03:40:28,904 --> 03:40:37,189
[SPEAKER_10]: This presentation is in support of the proclamation for a hunger-free Medford by 2028, unanimously supported by the Medford School Committee on February 3rd, 2020.

2246
03:40:37,289 --> 03:40:42,012
[SPEAKER_10]: The presentation

2247
03:40:42,531 --> 03:40:59,475
[SPEAKER_10]: and all supporting documentation shall be forwarded to a committee of the whole, yet to be scheduled for the purpose of creating an advisory committee on hunger, yet to be, as was unanimously approved by the Medford School Committee on February 3rd, 2020.

2248
03:41:00,595 --> 03:41:07,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, welcome.

2249
03:41:08,137 --> 03:41:08,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2250
03:41:08,817 --> 03:41:10,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for having us tonight.

2251
03:41:10,878 --> 03:41:11,818
[SPEAKER_04]: I really appreciate it.

2252
03:41:12,603 --> 03:41:17,305
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a slide deck to share, so I'll just pull that up quickly.

2253
03:41:17,325 --> 03:41:21,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's been a long night.

2254
03:41:21,846 --> 03:41:25,868
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll do my best to make this entertaining.

2255
03:41:28,389 --> 03:41:40,453
[SPEAKER_04]: So my name is Andreanne, and I work on food access with the City of Medford Board of Health and the Medford Food Security Task Force, along with my co-presenters tonight, Saran McGibbon and Diane Sullivan.

2256
03:41:42,009 --> 03:41:55,136
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford Food Security Task Force is a group of community providers, community advocates, religious leaders, and parents and residents and public employees all concerned about food security.

2257
03:41:57,038 --> 03:42:06,423
[SPEAKER_04]: So as many of you may know, SNAP is an acronym for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which was formerly known as Food Stamps.

2258
03:42:07,261 --> 03:42:10,843
[SPEAKER_04]: But what some of you may not know is what the SNAP gap is.

2259
03:42:11,244 --> 03:42:23,391
[SPEAKER_04]: And the SNAP gap measures the difference between the number of low-income Massachusetts residents receiving MassHealth who may be SNAP eligible, and the number of people actually receiving SNAP.

2260
03:42:24,312 --> 03:42:32,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And so according to MassLegal Services of last year, the statewide gap was over 46%, and in Medford, the gap was 63%.

2261
03:42:35,757 --> 03:42:43,798
[SPEAKER_04]: over 20% over the state average.

2262
03:42:44,619 --> 03:42:51,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Closing the SNAP gap has advantages for both enrolled families and the community at large.

2263
03:42:51,580 --> 03:43:04,362
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, some short-term benefits include reducing overall food insecurity, which is a huge one, but also improving the overall health of families and decrease healthcare costs from better nutrition.

2264
03:43:05,300 --> 03:43:16,462
[SPEAKER_04]: and also long-term benefits of generating over 2 billion in economic stimulus to the state and local economy through using the benefits at local grocers and markets.

2265
03:43:16,742 --> 03:43:18,843
[SPEAKER_08]: And- May I ask a question?

2266
03:43:18,883 --> 03:43:23,084
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, Andrea, to interrupt you, but are you progressing the slide deck at all?

2267
03:43:23,104 --> 03:43:24,584
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I'm only seeing the cover.

2268
03:43:25,244 --> 03:43:30,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I was, but I think I'm having, I'm going to try again.

2269
03:43:30,265 --> 03:43:30,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

2270
03:43:33,266 --> 03:43:34,646
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll keep it at the,

2271
03:43:36,469 --> 03:43:38,951
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see the second slide now?

2272
03:43:39,912 --> 03:43:40,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good.

2273
03:43:41,273 --> 03:43:43,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that, everyone.

2274
03:43:43,294 --> 03:43:47,478
[SPEAKER_04]: And though not cited, this information is also from MassLegalServices.

2275
03:43:50,200 --> 03:43:59,948
[SPEAKER_04]: So to better understand why some families who might be eligible for SNAP don't enroll, we conducted a SNAP gap study.

2276
03:44:00,760 --> 03:44:13,928
[SPEAKER_04]: And this included interviews with Medford families with lived experiences of food insecurity as well as Medford serving community providers who work directly with residents facing food insecurity.

2277
03:44:16,810 --> 03:44:20,952
[SPEAKER_04]: As I mentioned previously, the SNAP gap in Medford is higher than the state average at 63%.

2278
03:44:21,452 --> 03:44:29,317
[SPEAKER_04]: The families we interviewed, we had 10 Medford families with young children who self-disclosed as food insecure.

2279
03:44:30,395 --> 03:44:41,218
[SPEAKER_04]: who were enrolled in MassHealth alone, so those were six out of 10 families interviewed, or in MassHealth and SNAP, and those represented four of the 10 families we spoke to.

2280
03:44:42,458 --> 03:44:56,921
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of the providers that we interviewed, we interviewed 10 community providers from nine different organizations in the community, including Medford Family Network, as well as our local Melrose-Wakefield Hospital.

2281
03:44:59,953 --> 03:45:06,778
[SPEAKER_04]: So some food access barriers that were expressed by families generally related to wider systems of disparity and disadvantage.

2282
03:45:07,659 --> 03:45:15,305
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, financial challenges such as working minimum wage jobs and navigating fluctuating incomes.

2283
03:45:16,806 --> 03:45:27,835
[SPEAKER_04]: They also referenced time or tensions in time between time spent working to earn money and time spent dedicated to food related activities.

2284
03:45:29,319 --> 03:45:35,821
[SPEAKER_04]: That includes meal prep, grocery shopping, cooking, and et cetera.

2285
03:45:35,941 --> 03:45:45,564
[SPEAKER_04]: And the balance between making more money to be able to provide food versus actually prepping that food.

2286
03:45:46,344 --> 03:45:57,887
[SPEAKER_04]: And so families also mentioned that they were lacking options that reflected Medford's cultural diversity and limited access to healthy

2287
03:45:58,560 --> 03:46:00,081
[SPEAKER_04]: and high quality food options.

2288
03:46:00,602 --> 03:46:10,249
[SPEAKER_04]: This was further made difficult by what the families referenced as unreliable and disconnected public transportation.

2289
03:46:11,730 --> 03:46:25,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Similarly, our providers expressed similar issues, for example, in regards to availability, accessibility and affordability of foods in Medford, including

2290
03:46:26,192 --> 03:46:35,740
[SPEAKER_04]: the direct costs of fresh food and produce, as well as the opportunity cost of buying cheap, ready-made food, such as fast food.

2291
03:46:37,142 --> 03:46:52,435
[SPEAKER_04]: As well, these providers mentioned the limitations to cooking, such as accessibility of cooking equipment, abilities in cooking, itself a cooking skills, as well as physical limitations

2292
03:46:53,523 --> 03:46:57,086
[SPEAKER_04]: for people with limited mobility or older adults in cooking.

2293
03:47:02,789 --> 03:47:19,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, so then also including they meant families spoke to SNAP barriers and families offered suggestions on improving issues of application support and the quality of care within the SNAP program.

2294
03:47:20,501 --> 03:47:21,502
[SPEAKER_04]: So specifically,

2295
03:47:23,152 --> 03:47:49,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Issues of application support include that the enrollment would be benefited from streamlined applications and more substantial program benefits as these applications can be quite lengthy and complicated with the minimum benefit of $16 per month and the maximum benefit, for example, a two-person

2296
03:47:50,427 --> 03:48:12,415
[SPEAKER_04]: household is 355 per month, sorry, but that would be found if, sorry, not many families receive the maximum benefit because this is generally if income is equal to housing expenses, bills, and medical bills as well.

2297
03:48:13,516 --> 03:48:18,838
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and additionally, a lot of families referenced

2298
03:48:20,067 --> 03:48:36,818
[SPEAKER_04]: how stressful and emotionally challenging it can be to apply for these benefits, such as internal challenges of shame and guilt, but also many families mentioned the external challenges of patronizing attitudes from staff and personnel.

2299
03:48:39,520 --> 03:48:46,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the SNAP barriers expressed by providers included access to information and outreach,

2300
03:48:47,548 --> 03:48:51,950
[SPEAKER_04]: issues around stigma and also referenced the lack of application support.

2301
03:48:53,830 --> 03:49:03,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Some information and outreach barriers mentioned were language barriers, immigration fears, and misinformation that hinders residents' knowledge of available resources.

2302
03:49:04,214 --> 03:49:12,017
[SPEAKER_04]: And stigma was referenced as both pride and social stigma that prevent residents from confidently seeking assistance.

2303
03:49:13,185 --> 03:49:25,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, as mentioned already, that applying for SNAP often takes a significant amount of planning and coordination, which many families do not have the support to do.

2304
03:49:26,593 --> 03:49:38,320
[SPEAKER_04]: So some suggestions for improving food access that we received from our families and providers were, as I mentioned, related to the application support was offering direct human support.

2305
03:49:39,520 --> 03:49:56,407
[SPEAKER_04]: using social media outlets such as Facebook, which was the most commonly cited, using your school communication systems with which all of our families mentioned is where they get a lot of their information of Medford updates, and using trusted community partners such as the Medford Family Network.

2306
03:49:57,768 --> 03:50:06,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Lastly, many families mentioned that our messaging could help positively promote SNAP as part of the essential healthcare system.

2307
03:50:07,986 --> 03:50:32,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Some suggestions for community providers included conducting regular outreach in the communities, including presentations on food assistance options, which of course includes raising awareness on food insecurity in general, and also suggested promoting social support by sharing diverse food cultures.

2308
03:50:33,251 --> 03:50:36,332
[SPEAKER_04]: So not necessarily focusing on scarcity, but sharing

2309
03:50:37,614 --> 03:50:39,295
[SPEAKER_04]: the positive of what we have to offer.

2310
03:50:40,596 --> 03:50:53,288
[SPEAKER_04]: And then lastly, in terms of the SNAPGAP report, there were suggestions for programming around providing culturally relevant food options for free and reduced lunch and in our local pantries.

2311
03:50:55,069 --> 03:51:02,636
[SPEAKER_04]: There was also the suggestion of supporting local community groups working with and run by Black, Indigenous, people of color,

2312
03:51:03,173 --> 03:51:08,277
[SPEAKER_04]: immigrants and people with lived experience for a more community driven food assistance programming.

2313
03:51:08,297 --> 03:51:18,566
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, reference to the application support in providing food resource Councilors in community spaces to help residents apply for food assistance.

2314
03:51:19,267 --> 03:51:29,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And then lastly, suggestions for policy include expanding application methods for school free and reduced lunch for accessibility and clarity as many families were

2315
03:51:30,866 --> 03:51:32,887
[SPEAKER_04]: unaware that it was a household application.

2316
03:51:33,687 --> 03:51:36,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Many thought that it was an application per student.

2317
03:51:37,609 --> 03:51:40,890
[SPEAKER_04]: And many families did not know that it was a rolling application.

2318
03:51:43,011 --> 03:51:54,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the last two pieces are much wider in scope in terms of developing internal policies that target prejudice within our institutions that provide community assistance.

2319
03:51:55,675 --> 03:52:09,319
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, engaging cross-sectorally to combat the wider systemic barriers such as housing, income, and transportation to grow food security as an outcome of other economic and social securities.

2320
03:52:10,999 --> 03:52:21,682
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will pass the rest of the presentation to my colleague, Diane Sullivan, who is a parent and a consultant with the Center for Law and Social Policy and a strong food access advocate.

2321
03:52:32,924 --> 03:52:33,084
[SPEAKER_10]: Ms.

2322
03:52:33,104 --> 03:52:37,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Sullivan, do we need to give you access to unmute yourself one second?

2323
03:52:39,631 --> 03:52:40,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, can you hear me now?

2324
03:52:40,992 --> 03:52:41,232
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2325
03:52:41,312 --> 03:52:42,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, excellent.

2326
03:52:42,433 --> 03:52:43,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

2327
03:52:45,200 --> 03:52:46,461
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, good evening.

2328
03:52:46,682 --> 03:52:52,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I am Diane Sullivan and I live on Jerome Street in West Medford.

2329
03:52:52,447 --> 03:52:58,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to the committee and to our superintendent for all of the work and for the opportunity to be here with you.

2330
03:52:58,653 --> 03:53:04,980
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd also like to thank Diane and Sara for their diligent work on this report and their work on behalf

2331
03:53:06,300 --> 03:53:07,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Food Security Task Force.

2332
03:53:08,501 --> 03:53:18,404
[SPEAKER_05]: Like many of you, I wear many hats, and I am a member of the Food Security Task Force and other local, state, national anti-hunger groups and effort.

2333
03:53:18,764 --> 03:53:19,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm also a parent.

2334
03:53:21,225 --> 03:53:26,207
[SPEAKER_05]: and a mom of five recent Mustang graduates.

2335
03:53:26,728 --> 03:53:36,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And additionally, what's most relevant here tonight, my family happens to fall within the SNAP being that my family is currently eligible for SNAP benefits that we are not right now receiving.

2336
03:53:38,033 --> 03:53:46,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm here to affirm both personally and professionally and qualify really the information that Andrean has just shared with me.

2337
03:53:48,032 --> 03:54:10,597
[SPEAKER_05]: you and take a moment to share a bit about the current land scan hunger nationally across the state and what's going on here locally and I'll tonight focus because of course you are the school committee not to discount other populations that are struggling now with feeding themselves and their families

2338
03:54:11,795 --> 03:54:18,959
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you can see from the information on the slide in front of the suffering is really widespread, but particularly hard hit are our children.

2339
03:54:19,500 --> 03:54:23,302
[SPEAKER_05]: And do believe Andrean will share these slides after his presentation.

2340
03:54:23,322 --> 03:54:31,826
[SPEAKER_05]: So to highlight a few points from the slides, this year nearly 6 million more children in America will experience food insecurity than in 2018.

2341
03:54:31,987 --> 03:54:37,430
[SPEAKER_05]: And in Massachusetts, if you look, we as a state will see the highest

2342
03:54:38,150 --> 03:54:56,447
[SPEAKER_05]: increase in hunger at 59% and for children, it's an overwhelming 102% increase here if a little bit Middlesex County is an astounding 143% increase to childhood hunger right here in our neighborhoods.

2343
03:54:57,425 --> 03:55:14,505
[SPEAKER_05]: As you can see from the local data provided by the DTA in the lower quadrant, since the beginning of the pandemic, we are averaging around 700 additional households who are currently receiving SNAP.

2344
03:55:14,545 --> 03:55:16,387
[SPEAKER_05]: So these numbers are pretty overwhelming.

2345
03:55:17,268 --> 03:55:21,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, and Andre and if you could move us to the next slide.

2346
03:55:21,531 --> 03:55:35,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we can talk about, you know, what are some of the solutions and I really wanted that slides will be available but that number for those that don't know PBT is the pandemic a BT this was this was stood up by the fed.

2347
03:55:36,240 --> 03:55:42,027
[SPEAKER_05]: to essentially replace the value of meals for students who would otherwise qualify for free reduced meals.

2348
03:55:42,948 --> 03:55:51,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And essentially right now we have 311 students within our school system who have qualified for these benefits.

2349
03:55:52,680 --> 03:55:59,343
[SPEAKER_05]: have had a card on their behalf to their, you know, to their last known address, have not yet activated the card.

2350
03:55:59,403 --> 03:56:02,064
[SPEAKER_05]: So right, as a community, we should be concerned about the barriers.

2351
03:56:02,845 --> 03:56:13,951
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, maybe some have moved into a different, you know, school district and, you know, they are connected with resources on that end, and that's great, but I worry about, you know, do they know that these benefits are available to them?

2352
03:56:14,471 --> 03:56:15,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they receive their card?

2353
03:56:15,912 --> 03:56:17,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they know how to pin the card?

2354
03:56:18,733 --> 03:56:20,914
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, which is essentially to activate it.

2355
03:56:21,815 --> 03:56:38,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And do they know that they can use these cards without penalties, particularly drawing out some of the fear that is within the immigrant communities here in Medford and beyond, you know, really nationwide concerns over accessing these PEBT benefits and could that have an impact.

2356
03:56:39,383 --> 03:56:42,526
[SPEAKER_05]: on public charge and I just want to assure folks it does not.

2357
03:56:43,386 --> 03:56:47,811
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I really wanted to talk about because what this draws out I think is some bigger points.

2358
03:56:49,072 --> 03:56:52,135
[SPEAKER_05]: And if Andre and if you could go to the next slide.

2359
03:56:52,155 --> 03:56:59,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sort of as we think about next steps for you know how we address hunger and particularly for our students here in Medford.

2360
03:57:00,242 --> 03:57:18,859
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, how do we ensure I just really pose the questions and as I did this I realized I was kind of answering a question with a question, one after this, but how do we ensure Medford students and their families are accessing the benefits for which they are eligible particularly around food right these two programs snap and pbt.

2361
03:57:19,600 --> 03:57:31,747
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, when I think about these things as a systems thinker I think, you know, how can the committee support the administration and how can we bring in Desi, how can we bring in DTA, the Department of Transitional

2362
03:57:33,320 --> 03:57:51,660
[SPEAKER_05]: that administers and make sure that we're connecting to again to ensure that our children have access to safe affordable nutritious food, and I absolutely want to echo our superintendent and say thank you to Medford food services and why who have been doing incredible work.

2363
03:57:52,240 --> 03:57:55,223
[SPEAKER_05]: But we as a community have a lot more that we can and should be doing.

2364
03:57:56,004 --> 03:58:04,110
[SPEAKER_05]: So on to the next question you know how do we build a more inclusive Medford that really prioritizes the well being of students and their families struggling with hunger and security.

2365
03:58:04,611 --> 03:58:06,893
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not saying that you know we're all here.

2366
03:58:07,433 --> 03:58:13,895
[SPEAKER_05]: We all have the best of intentions and we're doing, I think, a lot, in most circumstances, the best that we can.

2367
03:58:13,935 --> 03:58:24,457
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think when we look at this report, and I hope that committee members, again, I know it's been a long night, when we look at the report and let's really hear what the families are saying about what some of the barriers are.

2368
03:58:24,477 --> 03:58:34,599
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that when we meaningfully engaged, I love hearing that term, really when we engage folks equitably, we'll find that they know the solutions, right?

2369
03:58:34,659 --> 03:58:36,880
[SPEAKER_05]: We've just got to welcome them into the space.

2370
03:58:37,640 --> 03:58:58,990
[SPEAKER_05]: um where they know the space is equitable and you've really got to start with building relationships and that brings us to the last question is really about how do we foster trust and build equitable relationships with medford students and their families um that's really the crux of the work that i do um you engage in community so that together we can identify solutions so that we're not

2371
03:58:59,490 --> 03:59:13,516
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, sometimes solving problems that, you know, don't exist, right, that we're really hearing from folks and hearing what their struggles are, and then making sure that they're a part of the solutions as, again, together we work to work this through.

2372
03:59:13,676 --> 03:59:21,740
[SPEAKER_05]: I am going to, with that, thank you again for your time and your attention on this critical matter, and hand it back over to Andrianne.

2373
03:59:22,120 --> 03:59:24,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm available to, you know, for any questions as well.

2374
03:59:24,621 --> 03:59:24,961
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2375
03:59:26,502 --> 03:59:26,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2376
03:59:31,297 --> 03:59:33,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Diane, for sharing that.

2377
03:59:33,379 --> 03:59:36,722
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, thank you school committee for having us.

2378
03:59:37,262 --> 03:59:46,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that this report will provide more insight as we work together to create a hunger-free Medford by 2028.

2379
03:59:47,331 --> 03:59:56,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that I provided the full eight page report, but if you're interested, it is on the Medford website at the food resources in Medford page.

2380
03:59:58,313 --> 04:00:02,555
[SPEAKER_04]: And Sara, do you wanna talk a bit about the task force, just to wrap things up?

2381
04:00:07,178 --> 04:00:07,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, thanks.

2382
04:00:08,319 --> 04:00:11,060
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks everyone for your interest in this important matter.

2383
04:00:12,181 --> 04:00:22,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was great that there was a discussion earlier in the night about the meals that both the Malden Y and the public schools are providing to our community.

2384
04:00:23,827 --> 04:00:29,489
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's clear that we do need to increase those meals and the task force has been talking about how we can do that.

2385
04:00:30,089 --> 04:00:46,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Also like the larger context of the problem as we started talking about it before the pandemic and we know that the problem is much worse now but I think we've all agreed that this is an important problem and we still want to work towards making Medford hunger free by 2028.

2386
04:00:47,035 --> 04:00:49,856
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not, it's something that we

2387
04:00:51,051 --> 04:00:54,213
[SPEAKER_01]: still need to work on and still feel like is doable.

2388
04:00:56,394 --> 04:01:03,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone wants to join the food security task force, you can send me an email and I can add you to our email list.

2389
04:01:03,378 --> 04:01:05,179
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have social media or anything.

2390
04:01:05,559 --> 04:01:10,262
[SPEAKER_01]: We just have our email list and some of our information on the city of Medford website.

2391
04:01:12,583 --> 04:01:16,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Sarah and Adrian and Diane for the presentation.

2392
04:01:16,545 --> 04:01:19,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Ruseau.

2393
04:01:21,143 --> 04:01:22,664
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, thank you for the presentation.

2394
04:01:22,684 --> 04:01:46,852
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I know the answer to the question, because I think I asked it once before, but the 311 students, I mean, that number is really, with my own history around hunger, that's really kind of hard to comprehend that there's literally food that these students could use these cards for, and they're not.

2395
04:01:49,064 --> 04:01:57,730
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's interesting that, sure, some of them have possibly moved, but I'm sure that the vast majority of them have not, and they're just not using their benefits.

2396
04:01:58,430 --> 04:02:11,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Am I correct that the identities cannot be shared with the school, and it's one of those awful snap different agencies problem where you can't tell us so that we can perhaps reach out?

2397
04:02:12,299 --> 04:02:18,723
[SPEAKER_16]: Or can the school district actually get the list and perhaps do some of that outreach?

2398
04:02:21,888 --> 04:02:24,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that's a fantastic question.

2399
04:02:24,589 --> 04:02:27,570
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry it says my internet stable.

2400
04:02:28,171 --> 04:02:29,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Am I good.

2401
04:02:29,451 --> 04:02:29,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you hear me.

2402
04:02:30,792 --> 04:02:31,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, sorry about that.

2403
04:02:34,410 --> 04:02:36,212
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a fantastic question.

2404
04:02:36,972 --> 04:02:54,468
[SPEAKER_05]: And my recommendation would be for this committee to make a request to DESE and to DTA, the Department of Transitional Assistance, and ask if that information can be shared.

2405
04:02:57,897 --> 04:03:12,594
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to have an offline conversation about potential unintended consequences that of course we'd want to avoid, but

2406
04:03:16,256 --> 04:03:28,529
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that perhaps the more requests that you see from the district that said, if there are resources, the flexibility would come from the state to provide this information.

2407
04:03:29,490 --> 04:03:36,618
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask that the committee, whoever might receive that, of course, treat it special.

2408
04:03:38,640 --> 04:03:43,503
[SPEAKER_05]: as it should be, and just be, say, weaponized against children.

2409
04:03:44,924 --> 04:03:55,350
[SPEAKER_05]: But nonetheless, let's do our due diligence to make sure that folks know that these benefits are there for them, and if they need support in accessing them, that there are resources to support that.

2410
04:03:55,670 --> 04:03:57,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a fantastic question.

2411
04:03:59,492 --> 04:03:59,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2412
04:03:59,852 --> 04:04:00,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

2413
04:04:02,114 --> 04:04:03,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have another question, member Rizzo?

2414
04:04:03,755 --> 04:04:05,737
[SPEAKER_16]: I was just going to say thank you.

2415
04:04:05,817 --> 04:04:11,342
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll certainly reach out to you about if there's anything we can get moving along on that.

2416
04:04:12,483 --> 04:04:12,764
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2417
04:04:13,284 --> 04:04:14,645
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

2418
04:04:17,468 --> 04:04:17,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2419
04:04:18,068 --> 04:04:19,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for this presentation.

2420
04:04:20,800 --> 04:04:28,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember before the pandemic when you, the food security task force had a presentation at city hall.

2421
04:04:28,502 --> 04:04:31,703
[SPEAKER_08]: It was my first presentation that I had gone to and it was so compelling.

2422
04:04:31,823 --> 04:04:34,664
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think this data is really important.

2423
04:04:34,984 --> 04:04:42,726
[SPEAKER_08]: And also I think that some of the basic, I think I either, I think I might've asked a question at city hall that night and it really resonated with me.

2424
04:04:42,766 --> 04:04:48,128
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted to make sure that it shared, you know, whenever it's talked about, cause I asked the difference between

2425
04:04:48,861 --> 04:04:50,403
[SPEAKER_08]: food security and hunger.

2426
04:04:50,423 --> 04:05:00,217
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it was explained to me that, you know, the difference between food security and hunger is, you know, we all feel hungry.

2427
04:05:00,693 --> 04:05:03,694
[SPEAKER_08]: we don't all have to worry about where our next meal is coming from.

2428
04:05:04,615 --> 04:05:07,115
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was the difference between hunger and food insecurity.

2429
04:05:07,135 --> 04:05:10,437
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thought that that was just really important for me to hear.

2430
04:05:11,497 --> 04:05:19,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Also having experienced food insecurity as a child and giving that a name and having it really be validated for children.

2431
04:05:19,560 --> 04:05:28,864
[SPEAKER_08]: And I really liked the way that you talk about normalizing what food insecurity is and helping people understand that

2432
04:05:30,008 --> 04:05:36,874
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there are folks out in our community who may not look like they've experienced food insecurity but certainly have.

2433
04:05:37,615 --> 04:05:48,926
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also really interested in the promoting social support by sharing diverse cultures and also the menu for diverse food so it both in our, you know, free and reduced lunch and in our

2434
04:05:49,446 --> 04:06:10,316
[SPEAKER_08]: schools, and I'm wondering how that might be moved forward, because that is something that the students have also shared very clearly, I think, with many, many members of our school committee as well, around just the, you know, culturally diverse food, you know, that's offered in the school as well, and also thinking about that in terms of food insecurity.

2435
04:06:10,356 --> 04:06:14,338
[SPEAKER_08]: So how might we move that forward from a school committee perspective?

2436
04:06:19,807 --> 04:06:29,117
[SPEAKER_10]: maybe talk to the cafeteria staff with regards to the meal planning, meal prep, and see if we can get some different options.

2437
04:06:30,599 --> 04:06:34,183
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe that would come from the admin, Dr. Edouard-Vincent or somebody from

2438
04:06:35,473 --> 04:06:36,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Mia, did you raise your hand?

2439
04:06:37,074 --> 04:06:37,335
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

2440
04:06:37,655 --> 04:06:38,295
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mayor.

2441
04:06:38,435 --> 04:06:50,244
[SPEAKER_18]: I just wanted to suggest, and you might already be doing it, Dr. Maurice, but could this be emailed through the different principals on the elementary level and the middle school levels directly to their school community?

2442
04:06:51,085 --> 04:06:58,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I think when parents receive emails from the district, and I'll speak for myself, sometimes I don't read them all, because I think it's a lot of information.

2443
04:06:58,912 --> 04:07:05,037
[SPEAKER_18]: But if I get one from Mr. Johnson or Mr. Downs, and I know it's specific to my kids' grades, I'll read it.

2444
04:07:05,077 --> 04:07:14,385
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe if it was the end of the slide deck was a suggestion about just getting it out there on social media or maybe on the Medford Public Schools Facebook page.

2445
04:07:14,425 --> 04:07:19,129
[SPEAKER_18]: But I think an email from principals, because parents trust most of our principals,

2446
04:07:20,535 --> 04:07:22,436
[SPEAKER_18]: that it's a resource that can be used.

2447
04:07:22,476 --> 04:07:28,117
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think this is the time that parents, oh, Tegan's telling me I'm talking too long.

2448
04:07:28,377 --> 04:07:28,877
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all.

2449
04:07:28,897 --> 04:07:32,518
[SPEAKER_18]: Tegan, leave her alone.

2450
04:07:32,538 --> 04:07:34,818
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I agree with you.

2451
04:07:34,878 --> 04:07:37,519
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with you, Member Mustone.

2452
04:07:38,379 --> 04:07:44,180
[SPEAKER_10]: I met with Sarah and Adrian last week to discuss this.

2453
04:07:44,260 --> 04:07:49,201
[SPEAKER_10]: And one thing I did mention is how great the admin's been doing

2454
04:07:50,974 --> 04:07:52,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Friday updates to the community.

2455
04:07:52,715 --> 04:07:56,896
[SPEAKER_10]: And especially I think Dr. Cushing, you're the one that helps translate all the emails.

2456
04:07:56,996 --> 04:08:11,719
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it'd be important to just have a paragraph about the SnapGap and the link that people can apply, as well as let people know that there's 311 people, families out there that have this card.

2457
04:08:11,779 --> 04:08:14,180
[SPEAKER_10]: Please make sure if you have it, you don't forget to use it.

2458
04:08:14,567 --> 04:08:15,547
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's important.

2459
04:08:15,728 --> 04:08:33,096
[SPEAKER_10]: And then to member McLaughlin, yeah, I think we'd have to have a longer discussion with the cafeteria and admin, but I think that's something that definitely even something different every month based on a culture that would be great to have as an option for our students.

2460
04:08:33,516 --> 04:08:34,436
[SPEAKER_10]: So I second that.

2461
04:08:35,077 --> 04:08:37,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'd like to think about how we may operationalize that.

2462
04:08:37,758 --> 04:08:41,900
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a little bit late for my brain to function wrap around that right now, but

2463
04:08:42,987 --> 04:08:49,394
[SPEAKER_08]: know, I'd love to, I'll reach out to Shiraz as well and see if there's a way that we can be thinking about operationalizing that.

2464
04:08:49,454 --> 04:08:49,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2465
04:08:50,775 --> 04:08:51,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor?

2466
04:08:52,057 --> 04:08:52,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van der Kloot.

2467
04:08:53,338 --> 04:08:58,584
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to thank you for the report.

2468
04:08:58,804 --> 04:08:59,304
[SPEAKER_06]: It really was

2469
04:09:01,615 --> 04:09:12,449
[SPEAKER_06]: good to hear, although of course it's difficult to hear too, to think in our community, we have so many people who are food insecure, but thank you very much for the report and for your work.

2470
04:09:15,013 --> 04:09:31,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I also just wanted to say thank you for the presentation and that, yes, we can definitely put in a link in this week's Friday communication and to member Mustone's recommendation to also have the individual principals do that as well.

2471
04:09:31,307 --> 04:09:35,450
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can get the message out there and get it out.

2472
04:09:35,810 --> 04:09:37,452
[SPEAKER_03]: We can get it translated as well.

2473
04:09:38,733 --> 04:09:39,774
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can work on that.

2474
04:09:40,915 --> 04:09:41,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

2475
04:09:42,688 --> 04:09:58,656
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, and Sarah, Adrienne, and Diane, if you have any specific language that you wanna help the admin with, I'm sure they'd be, those get translated, I'm assuming Thursday or Friday, so just get some information over to us when you can, that'd be great.

2476
04:10:04,059 --> 04:10:09,202
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess my last question is, is there anybody in the school system that helps families

2477
04:10:10,488 --> 04:10:19,154
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we know we have the paperwork for free and reduced lunch, and I'm sure that we have staff that could help a family through that.

2478
04:10:19,194 --> 04:10:25,578
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have anybody that helps families fill out, say, the SNAP paperwork or applications?

2479
04:10:26,019 --> 04:10:28,981
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think we do, but I'm asking the question to the admin.

2480
04:10:32,343 --> 04:10:36,406
[SPEAKER_10]: Guidance Councilors or social workers.

2481
04:10:37,350 --> 04:10:42,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that is something that I can definitely look more closely into I would not be surprised if.

2482
04:10:44,072 --> 04:10:47,313
[SPEAKER_03]: either adjustment Councilors or guidance Councilors.

2483
04:10:48,473 --> 04:11:09,759
[SPEAKER_03]: If some of those staff, even some of our special educators or EL family, EL educators who may be bilingual or use some of the translation devices, translation apps to work with families that they may have done that.

2484
04:11:09,839 --> 04:11:12,840
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can definitely follow up to find out

2485
04:11:13,880 --> 04:11:19,824
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's something that is happening on a consistent basis or infrequently.

2486
04:11:21,285 --> 04:11:24,968
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure there are staff helping too, and so I appreciate you looking into that.

2487
04:11:25,028 --> 04:11:26,069
[SPEAKER_10]: That's great.

2488
04:11:28,717 --> 04:11:30,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just like to add to that point.

2489
04:11:30,598 --> 04:11:44,942
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess I think Sara could clarify, but we were approached by Project Bread asking who our city and or school SNAP and our SNAP liaison coordinator would be or is.

2490
04:11:45,882 --> 04:11:50,923
[SPEAKER_04]: And neither Saran nor I knew of a specific person to point them to.

2491
04:11:51,123 --> 04:11:56,965
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I guess it's a similar question of asking who is that point person.

2492
04:11:57,418 --> 04:11:58,880
[SPEAKER_04]: that can help families apply.

2493
04:12:01,022 --> 04:12:02,504
[SPEAKER_03]: I just received a message.

2494
04:12:02,624 --> 04:12:03,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Textera.

2495
04:12:03,945 --> 04:12:13,957
[SPEAKER_03]: He has said that he knows his EL teachers and translators have supported families with that, but I

2496
04:12:16,820 --> 04:12:27,106
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, since our EL teachers are working with our second language English learner students, I'm not sure who the point person would be for.

2497
04:12:28,346 --> 04:12:42,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to reach out to me, my office, and I can coordinate it and, you know, designate a point person to be able to work with you on this project, that'll be fine.

2498
04:12:43,995 --> 04:12:44,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2499
04:12:44,395 --> 04:12:44,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2500
04:12:44,996 --> 04:12:45,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that'd be great.

2501
04:12:46,413 --> 04:12:52,319
[SPEAKER_10]: And on the city side, if anybody asks me about food insecurity, I lead them to Sarai.

2502
04:12:53,360 --> 04:12:58,145
[SPEAKER_10]: But obviously Sarai is part-time and doesn't help with the applications, but we can look into that as well.

2503
04:12:59,781 --> 04:13:12,797
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mayor if I could just add one thing to answer committee member McLaughlin's question or to make a suggestion, particularly, you know, back to how we meaningfully engage folks.

2504
04:13:13,337 --> 04:13:17,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I bet if you could somehow maybe even in the classroom I'm sure there's a lesson in here somewhere.

2505
04:13:18,883 --> 04:13:32,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Engage the students, you know, and what kind of meals, they would like to see or like to share from their culture, you know, and see it and eventually hopefully when everybody's back and safe, you know, see in their cafeteria perhaps.

2506
04:13:34,249 --> 04:13:35,570
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, a regular basis.

2507
04:13:35,610 --> 04:13:39,832
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will always encourage us to really go to the experts.

2508
04:13:39,892 --> 04:13:51,098
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're trying to feed students, they're the experts and, you know, really try to, you know, bring them and set a seat at the table, again, where they feel the equitable environment that's supporting them.

2509
04:13:51,698 --> 04:13:53,159
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, thank you all.

2510
04:13:53,239 --> 04:13:59,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm excited for the conversation, you know, post the presentation and to really just continue the great work of

2511
04:14:00,562 --> 04:14:04,604
[SPEAKER_05]: that's coming out of the city and the Food Security Task Force.

2512
04:14:04,824 --> 04:14:13,007
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got a lot of challenges, but we've got a lot of great committed folks looking at this issue with the critical lens with which it needs to be looked at.

2513
04:14:13,067 --> 04:14:13,828
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you all.

2514
04:14:15,068 --> 04:14:15,488
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

2515
04:14:16,469 --> 04:14:17,089
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

2516
04:14:17,489 --> 04:14:18,149
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate it.

2517
04:14:20,730 --> 04:14:24,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Next, we just have, I think, three condolences.

2518
04:14:25,772 --> 04:14:29,374
[SPEAKER_10]: The Medford School Committee offers its sincere condolences

2519
04:14:30,225 --> 04:14:40,672
[SPEAKER_10]: to the family of Torvey Elizabeth Heard, who was a 1993 inductee into the Mustang Hall of Fame, having lettered in field hockey, basketball, and softball.

2520
04:14:42,674 --> 04:14:56,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, the Medford School Committee offers its sincere condolences to the family of John Della Spentura, a World War II veteran and father of McGlynn Elementary School principal, Diane Guarino.
