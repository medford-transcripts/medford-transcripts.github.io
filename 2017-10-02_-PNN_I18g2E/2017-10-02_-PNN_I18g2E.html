    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=23.145s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=23.805s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=24.786s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=25.606s">President</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=26.707s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=27.187s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=29.669s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=38.879s">with</a>  liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=41.521s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=43.983s">Do</a>  we suspend the rules to take a paper out of order? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=47.726s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=49.747s">We</a>  can suspend the rules to take 16-574 out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=54.171s">Tonight</a>  the Committee of the Whole met regarding the University Accountability Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=60.195s">We</a>  had discussed it last week on the council floor and it got moved to subcommittee and we discussed it tonight and there are a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=68.82s">Amendments</a>  to the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=70.841s">And</a>  of the amendments, we have that the administration provide assistance for code enforcement when we receive the report back from Tufts University, that Tufts looks into landlords registering with Tufts University. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=88.408s">Notifications</a>  be sent from the building commissioner to all realtors in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=95.415s">And</a>  the last amendment was that the zoning ordinance go out with the next tax bill so that everyone in the community is aware of the ordinance change with regard to the University Accountability Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=108.957s">So</a>  at this point, I'd like to make a motion that the committee report be adopted as amended and the ordinance take its first reading.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=117.879s">You</a>  have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=118.479s">Seconded.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=119.319s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=120.719s">Mr.</a>  Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=120.919s">Mr.</a>  President, just if I could.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=124.487s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=125.888s">I</a>  think the, uh, the last amendment that was offered was that, um, a copy of the current, uh, city occupancy ordinance go out within the tax bill itself, not a copy of the ordinance that we're working on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=144.378s">I</a>  just want the record to reflect that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=145.899s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=161.523s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=162.343s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=480.651s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=480.991s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=481.492s">I</a>  like to see what we do work inside. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=483.412s">Um,</a>  so as far as, uh, so how much did we save actually by keeping it in house and doing it with our own employees as to contracting it out?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=490.814s">Uh,</a>  I don't have that figure readily available. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=493.194s">I</a>  can gladly supply a Councilor, but it was a significant, significant amount.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=497.235s">That's</a>  what I'm thinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=497.776s">I</a>  mean, it's, it's, uh, I know, um, you know, we have some talented people here that can do a lot of work of, you know,</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=503.55s">Very</a>  talented.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=504.731s">It</a>  would be great if we had more people, but it would be interesting to see how much of a savings this would represent by doing it in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=511.895s">So</a>  I'm glad we did it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=513.576s">And</a>  I'm sorry, did you say how many more we have to do, or how many more we need to do?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=516.638s">OK,</a>  it's a work in progress, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=518.159s">With</a>  this weather here, they keep cropping up, but we're starting to get ahead of it now from the initial list.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=525.544s">OK,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=526.405s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=526.825s">Councilor</a>  Neistat.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=530.986s">Mr.</a>  President, move approval of the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=532.827s">I</a>  think that the DPW director has shown that doing this work in-house is going to be a cost savings for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=539.629s">It</a>  also shows that his expectations were exceeded when he initially came to this council seeking funding back in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=546.791s">They</a>  were looking for some funds to fix 32 catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=549.652s">They</a>  fixed 32 and six more, and they continue to do the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=552.833s">I</a>  feel as though this is a good appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=555.122s">Coupled</a>  with the fact that the work is being performed in-house, Mr. President, I believe that we maintain control and direction of the employees and also the ability to get them out there faster and fix any mistakes that may or may not occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=565.507s">Personally,</a>  I feel as though the work that's done in-house is a far better product than what's done through subcontracted labor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=571.05s">And</a>  for those reasons, I support this paper wholeheartedly and move approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=577.092s">Mr.</a>  President, I want to express my gratitude to Commissioner Perrins and the members of the Department of Public Works for their good work in this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=586.539s">It's</a>  been, there have been a number that we've reported over the past several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=591.443s">We're</a>  glad to see great progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=594.305s">The</a>  Commissioner knows how to get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=596.927s">We're</a>  grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=597.968s">Second</a>  approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=599.989s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=602.131s">Vice</a>  President Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=603.992s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=606.179s">If</a>  I could, maybe Alicia can shed some light on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=610.061s">It</a>  said $50,000 was transferred from the highway materials and supplies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=615.405s">That</a>  account, what was the initial appropriation in this year's budget?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=620.448s">I</a>  don't know the initial appropriation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=621.569s">I</a>  know that you guys voted on a, to the President, excuse me, $100,000 in free cash to that account, and we needed to move $50,000 of that free cash you appropriated into the salary count since it's in-house and not contracted out.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=634.74s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=635.18s">So,</a>  so the, the account that you're saying this is 0 1 0 count 4 4 2 4 2 2 highway materials. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=643.267s">What,</a>  what is that currently used for? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=645.348s">What,</a>  what, what do we get with highway materials?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=649.712s">I</a>  think the DPW commission means that.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=656.397s">Councilor</a>  that's a useful miscellaneous supplies, uh, particularly for the highway division for day to day operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=663.853s">while</a>  we're on the subject here of catch basins. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=666.234s">It</a>  could be for frames, covers, cement, barrel block, asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=672.538s">It</a>  could be used for a whole host of reasons.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=676.6s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=677.18s">So</a>  by taking it out of that account and putting it into an overtime account, are we depleting that one account? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=684.003s">Are</a>  we running the red in that account right now?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=689.086s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=689.626s">What</a>  happened was when we did the original free cash appropriation <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=693.448s">We</a>  put $100,000 into this account. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=695.989s">We</a>  should have actually split it $50,000, $50,000 between personal and ordinary. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=701.051s">All</a>  $100,000 of the free cash appropriation is in that one ordinary account. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=704.652s">And</a>  in order for him to pay in-house employees, it has to be put into a personal account.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=710.594s">So</a>  why wasn't it put in the personal account immediately?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=713.375s">That</a>  was just overlooked. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=714.415s">That's</a>  why we're coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=715.576s">That</a>  was what? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=716.176s">It</a>  was overlooked. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=717.496s">It</a>  was overlooked? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=718.237s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=718.917s">They</a>  may have thought they were going to contract and said they start savings and did it in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=722.872s">instead</a>  of going out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=723.912s">If</a>  they had contracted, it would have been fine in the account that they had it in.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=726.993s">So</a>  is it fair to say there's $50,000 left in that account?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=732.355s">There's</a>  $50,000 of the salaries in that account that they can't use to pay the guys.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=738.218s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=738.398s">So</a>  what's currently left after you pull the $50,000 out?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=741.019s">I</a>  can get back to you on that and tell you what their balance is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=743.419s">I</a>  didn't bring that information with me.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=746.701s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=747.201s">And</a>  Commissioner Kerins, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=750.749s">Do</a>  you have an active working list of what catch basins need to be done in the community?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=755.375s">I</a>  can give you the completed list, and then whatever we've seen out there or has been reported to us, I do have a list that I can provide you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=767.77s">But</a>  I didn't bring it with me.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=769.251s">I'm</a>  not interested in the completed list. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=770.691s">I'd</a>  like to see a list of catch basins that you have record of that need attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=775.133s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=775.613s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=775.874s">No,</a>  I can gladly supply that to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=777.834s">But</a>  it's work, again, work in progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=780.395s">So</a>  whatever I may give you today or tomorrow may change two days from now, depending on what we come upon and what's reported.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=787.338s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=787.799s">Do</a>  you know roughly how many are on that list that need to be attended to?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=791.54s">I</a>  think right now I'd say at least 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=794.307s">All</a>  right, that we have out there that, in our opinion, have to be rebuilt.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=799.928s">Totally</a>  rebuilt.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=800.748s">Yeah,</a>  completely rebuilt. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=802.449s">I</a>  mean, just how far down we have to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=805.589s">We</a>  have to actually take off the cover and get down and inspect them, each one on a case-by-case basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=811.31s">Some</a>  of them are total rebuilds, which means going 10 feet down, working your way up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=816.211s">Some</a>  could be only the top four feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=819.092s">They</a>  all vary in condition.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=820.992s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=821.34s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=821.58s">If</a>  you can provide the council with a list of currently what needs to be done, um, because, because the number sounds awfully low to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=829.41s">And</a>  I realized you just said 12 need to be rebuilt, but in just going around the city, I see a lot of sunken catch basins.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=837.689s">A</a>  lot of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=839.05s">Yeah,</a>  there are. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=839.63s">Like</a>  I said, it's work in progress, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=841.55s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=841.95s">OK,</a>  that we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=843.03s">But</a>  I mean, we've made excellent headway. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=844.871s">Of</a>  course, this time of the year with the cold and everything, there are some days it's the weather permitting as far as actually working on, particularly when you're dealing with asphalt and cement. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=854.253s">But</a>  when we take advantage of a good day, we go out there and the crew can rebuild an average of three a day, again, depending on their condition when they start.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=865.414s">And</a>  while we're talking about catch basins, we still currently contract out for the cleaning of the catch basins, correct?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=871.44s">That's</a>  correct, sir.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=872.561s">And</a>  where do we stand with that currently?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=875.023s">Right</a>  now, we've obviously ceased for the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=878.506s">We'll</a>  pick the program back up in April and continue on with it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=884.385s">But</a>  are we a certain percentage through our list, or you said, I'm sure when the budget comes out in July, we start working on catch basin cleaning, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=894.01s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=894.811s">So</a>  how far do we get into the catch basin cleaning before the winter came?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=898.252s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=899.173s">Right</a>  now, I would have to say we're probably about 85 to 90% completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=904.436s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=904.596s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=905.076s">It's</a>  just now a question of our finishing up, you know, before, you know, the weather turned on us.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=909.985s">And</a>  it's all being done by the subcontractor? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=912.546s">That's</a>  correct, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=913.507s">And</a>  at any given year, do they get through 100% of the catch basins, or do we just subcontract for a certain percentage of what we have?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=921.33s">No,</a>  OK, from what I've gathered past history, they have been able to complete the portion in the summertime, fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=931.074s">And</a>  then they pick up back in the spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=933.375s">But</a>  they've pretty much stayed on top of cleaning all the basins in the city.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=937.718s">So</a>  every year, we're getting through 100% of the catch basin cleanings?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=942.401s">Very</a>  close to it, if not 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=943.702s">Again,</a>  it's only my first year here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=947.344s">My</a>  target is to get 100% by June 30. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=951.687s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=952.687s">And</a>  is the process still that this company will mark each catch basin? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=959.563s">different</a>  color when they are completed?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=962.586s">That's</a>  yes, it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=963.527s">That's</a>  correct, vice president.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=964.869s">So</a>  so they'll use some type of marking.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=966.851s">Yes,</a>  they're okay if they spray painted.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=975.58s">Okay,</a>  I can provide you the list of streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=978.392s">Okay,</a>  each street varies as far as the number of bases on each street.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1277.907s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1278.627s">Leo</a>  Sacco, police chief here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1281.067s">My</a>  home address is 227 Elm Street in Medford.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1285.625s">Chief,</a>  you have the critical response equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1289.649s">Could</a>  you tell us what that is?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1291.631s">Okay,</a>  that is, I'll explain what the critical incident or critical response team was developed last spring in light of what's going on around the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1302.822s">We</a>  need to train officers in our department to do a quick deployment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1307.122s">when</a>  they're working, if there's an incident, a major incident that might happen anywhere, whether it be at a mall, shopping center, school, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1315.728s">God</a>  forbid it happens, but we have to be prepared and be ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1320.391s">So</a>  we have 16 members of a team, actually I think it's down to 15 right now, that have been trained and outfitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1326.775s">This</a>  is a key piece of their equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1328.736s">This</a>  is a tactical vest that we need to outfit them with. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1332.939s">And</a>  it is a staggering figure, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1336.105s">We</a>  can't get reimbursement from the state or the federal government for this vest, because we already issued the other vest, the regular body armor, the soft body armor, for the individual officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1346.17s">And</a>  the state and the federal government will only reimburse for one set of body armor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1352.773s">So</a>  this is something that's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1354.354s">It's</a>  over and above. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1355.494s">It's</a>  a tactical vest. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1357.195s">They</a>  wear it like a jacket. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1358.736s">It's</a>  heavy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1359.937s">It</a>  takes a lot to hold it up, but it will withstand gunfire.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1366.072s">And</a>  the $25,000 for speed monitors, Chief, what kind of?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1369.674s">Members</a>  of this council have been asking for this for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1372.355s">We</a>  have one that was struck and I think it's beyond repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1375.516s">We've</a>  had a couple of companies look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1377.417s">This</a>  will buy two speed monitors so that we can be more effective out in the community as far as radar and speed enforcement and actually let the community see what the speed limit actually is on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1389.662s">Sometimes</a>  if you see a 20 mile per hour or a 30 mile per hour, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1394.206s">speed.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1394.506s">You</a>  think they're doing 50 and it's actually the monitor will show what the true speed is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1398.488s">So</a>  we look forward to those.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1400.969s">And</a>  I think chief, this is your biggest one here is, um, 12 cruises, six marked and six unmarked.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1407.931s">This</a>  is huge. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1408.912s">This</a>  is the first time, uh, been chief now going on 27 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1415.214s">This</a>  is the first time that I can say that, uh, that we'd be able to receive 12 brand new vehicles pretty much at one time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1423.237s">Uh,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1423.712s">six</a>  marked, six unmarked. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1425.974s">I</a>  know that sometimes there's a little issue with the idea of unmarked vehicles, but some of our unmarked vehicles are close to 20 years old, very high mileage. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1435.58s">Some</a>  of the old painted over Ford Crown Victorias, they look pretty good, but they're high mileage, they're 200,000 miles on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1443.686s">So,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1447.15s">We've</a>  run out of vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1448.43s">We're</a>  using drug forfeiture cars, which actually are pieces of junk. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1453.351s">This</a>  is something that we really need. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1454.891s">And</a>  I'm thankful that the mayor listened to my request and put it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1460.492s">But</a>  obviously, this council has been pushing for the marked vehicles right along and getting replacement vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1465.933s">So</a>  six will also be a good infusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1469.694s">And</a>  we'll probably be able to auction off the Crown Victorias that are really high mileage. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1474.615s">And</a>  it really served us well, but they're at <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1477.193s">the</a>  end of their life.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1479.134s">What</a>  type of vehicles are you planning on buying, Chief?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1481.335s">The</a>  Ford Explorer.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1482.996s">What</a>  about for the NMAC cars?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1484.056s">The</a>  NMACs are probably going to be Ford Fusions.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1487.858s">Thank</a>  you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1488.418s">I</a>  know it's something you've looked for a while, and I would hope you'll support that this evening.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1494.32s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1495.261s">And</a>  just to answer Councilor Falco's question, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1498.682s">I've</a>  been told by the Chief Procurement Officer that once this was approved, that they would place the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1505.546s">I've</a>  checked with the company that has the state contract for the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1509.328s">They</a>  would have to order the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1511.049s">Some</a>  of the vehicles may be in stock, but they would have to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1513.47s">So</a>  it would be dependent on how long it would take Ford Motor Company to get them off the assembly line. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1520.133s">But</a>  hopefully, definitely before the beginning of the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1524.095s">Thank</a>  you, Chief.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1525.176s">Mr.</a>  Cairns, would you like to?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1530.088s">Mr.</a>  Kearns make his presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1531.288s">Then</a>  we'll ask them everyone at the questions, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1533.828s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1537.089s">Mr.</a>  Kearns, why don't you, this equipment's for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1539.93s">So</a>  why don't you explain?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1541.33s">So</a>  this way, I'd like to just ask that we please amend the paper on, um, the $40,000 forestry F two 50 pickup truck with plow package should actually be UHF radio.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1553.633s">I'm</a>  sorry, which one is it? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1555.838s">For</a>  the forestry?</p>

    <p>[Aleesha Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1556.618s">Yes,</a>  the forestry F-250 for $40,000 should actually be UHF radio system for the DPW.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1564.483s">Mr.</a>  Gerens. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1565.223s">Yes,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1570.647s">The</a>  Department of Public Works has put in a request for the upgrade of some of the vehicles that are at the point now where they're really getting beyond repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1585.443s">You</a>  know, a lot of them, again, high mileage and, you know, now are also suffering from deterioration from, you know, body rot from over the years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1596.526s">Some</a>  of these vehicles are on state contract, so it would be just a question of finance department issuing a purchase order. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1605.908s">As</a>  far as the estimated time, you know, we're getting, you know, anywhere from, you know, one to three months depending on <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1613.264s">you</a>  know, what the specifications call for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1616.707s">As</a>  far as what the auditor was explaining as far as the radio communication system, the existing two-way radio communication system was, from what I gather, the history of it, is the original two-way radio system that the Medford Police Department got back <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1636.497s">many,</a>  many, many, many years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1639.639s">It</a>  is getting to the point, it's beyond repair. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1643.141s">Parts</a>  are no longer available. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1644.362s">It's</a>  an old low band system. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1646.703s">And</a>  what's happening now is a lot of guys have been using their cell phones because the radios in the trucks no longer work. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1657.189s">The</a>  range on them is very, very limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1660.652s">And</a>  it just needs a systems upgrade <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1664.848s">not</a>  only for getting the work done on a day-to-day basis and to stretch out the man hours rather than go back to the yard and get further instructions, but it's also for the safety of the personnel driving all the equipment that's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1680.259s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1684.882s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1685.342s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1688.424s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1690.286s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1691.767s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1692.467s">I</a>  just had a question for Chief Sacco.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1698.95s">Yes,</a>  sir.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1699.51s">Thank</a>  you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1700.67s">So</a>  with regard to the new cruisers, the marked and unmarked, so we're buying new cruisers, which is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1706.533s">We</a>  need them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1707.473s">But</a>  as far as the, what should be our strategy for purchasing going forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1711.955s">Should</a>  we be replacing cruisers? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1713.595s">I</a>  mean, in your opinion, you've been <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1715.381s">doing</a>  this for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1716.461s">What</a>  should the city be doing moving forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1719.423s">Should</a>  we be buying them every year, every few years? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1721.303s">What's</a>  the best approach?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1723.124s">The</a>  best approach is buying vehicles every year, five to six vehicles every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1728.466s">That</a>  would replace your frontline fleet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1732.328s">And</a>  then you could have a supervisor's vehicle or a canine vehicle or an unmarked vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1738.57s">With</a>  this happening right now, six and six, this gives us a great foundation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1743.432s">But</a>  we can't let a year slide by. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1745.799s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1745.979s">You</a>  have to stay on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1746.999s">You</a>  only need 12 every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1748.72s">But</a>  if you could replace, you know, five, four might not be just enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1753.921s">Five</a>  would be good. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1755.241s">Six</a>  would be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1756.141s">It</a>  would be the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1757.342s">Every</a>  year, there should be every year or no more than 18 months.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1761.823s">OK,</a>  perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1762.723s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1764.843s">Vice</a>  President Box. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1767.364s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1769.365s">Regarding</a>  the speed monitors for twenty five thousand, are we getting one or two chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1775.046s">How</a>  many speed?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1776.097s">The</a>  goal is two. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1777.078s">I</a>  believe we can purchase 12,500 for each.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1781.6s">And</a>  currently, how many speed monitors do we have within the department?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1784.462s">We</a>  have one that's inoperable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1787.103s">Right</a>  now, it was struck when it was on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1790.825s">So</a>  we just have one? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1792.426s">We</a>  really don't even have that one now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1794.447s">We</a>  need these two.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1795.748s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1797.269s">And</a>  the police cruisers and the EMAC vehicles, are they going to be fully equipped with the latest computers?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1805.659s">The,</a>  uh, the mock vehicles will be fully equipped with all, all the computers, radios, lighting, uh, the unmarked vehicles won't have computers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1815.007s">Every</a>  detective has a, uh, a laptop or a tablet so that they can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1819.53s">They</a>  don't need them in the, in the vehicle itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1822.152s">They</a>  will have radios in the vehicle and they'll have emergency lighting and a siren.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1828.758s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1829.69s">And</a>  I know within the budget chief, you put in for some additional civilian personnel to do some computer work and also some crime statistics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1840.352s">Is</a>  that still something that you could use in the police department?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1843.252s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1844.593s">Are</a>  you going to be making a recommendation for that manpower again or?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1848.733s">Yes,</a>  I will.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1849.693s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1850.434s">Do</a>  we expect to see it during the budget time or before budget?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1854.674s">It'll</a>  probably be a budget time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1856.315s">Budget</a>  time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1856.795s">We're</a>  well into the cycle right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1859.17s">So</a>  I will be submitting it in my next budget request.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1863.571s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1865.072s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1866.532s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1868.993s">Chief,</a>  along the same lines, great to see two monitors. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1871.873s">I</a>  think it's going to, one of the main complaints we get is speeding, and I think it's going to help curb the speeding issues we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1879.135s">With</a>  regards to that, I know we had spoke, and you were before us maybe a few months ago, with regards to, and we were asking questions with regards to the radar guns. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1887.061s">Was</a>  that also on your wish list and it just didn't make the cut tonight, or?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1890.664s">No,</a>  we're actually purchasing some new radar equipment out of our existing budget, out of the public safety account in our budget.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1899.352s">And</a>  how many, what are you purchasing?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1903.075s">I</a>  believe it'll be for handheld radar units.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1907.56s">Oh,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1909.962s">What</a>  account will that be coming out of?</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1911.163s">I</a>  believe it's public safety.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1917.898s">But</a>  it will be coming out of the budget that we set in June.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1920.939s">The</a>  existing budget that we're operating with.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1925.4s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1926.261s">And</a>  it's good just to see new cruisers and invest along with the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1930.082s">I</a>  know there's, I guess, probably another time we can talk about the items that didn't make this list today, because I know each department is in need of, whether it be vehicles in the DPW or radar guns, different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1944.766s">We're</a>  always hearing about the needs of <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1947.109s">these</a>  three departments, so it's nice to see the list here tonight and nice to move forward on things we've been requesting for quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1956.032s">Thank</a>  you for being here.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1956.792s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1958.913s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1959.793s">Mr.</a>  President, there are no surprises on this list. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1962.474s">It's</a>  stuff we've either asked for, lobbied for, heard department heads ask for, we've suggested, we've begged for, we've demanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1971.357s">Move</a>  approval.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1972.397s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1972.737s">You</a>  are 100% correct, Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1974.918s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1976.266s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1977.727s">And</a>  I certainly echo Councilor Dello Russo's sentiments. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1980.69s">I</a>  feel as though this is a good paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1982.131s">It</a>  reflects a lot of the desires and wishes of this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=1986.034s">In</a>  reviewing the appropriation, we're getting equipment to keep our police officers and firefighters safe, new vehicles for our police and our DPWs so that they can have the tools to do the job, and equipment to address efficiency of the administration and government, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2000.585s">So</a>  I feel as though this is a good paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2001.906s">I</a>  feel as though they're worthwhile expenditures. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2004.198s">And</a>  for that reason, I will be supporting this measure and move approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2008.481s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2009.421s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2009.701s">I'm</a>  not sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2010.082s">I</a>  didn't know if we were taking one department at a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2012.463s">If</a>  I could just ask a couple of questions with regards to the fire department computer system upgrade. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2018.146s">I</a>  don't know if that's.</p>

    <p>[Td1aKbafo1U_SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2019.887s">Deputy</a>  Chief Cuniff. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2022.048s">So</a>  Chief Kilgood is on vacation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2025.47s">So</a>  I'm not intimately involved with these day-to-day purchases. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2029.673s">But</a>  I know he did tell me that we needed, he's wanted this for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2033.745s">He</a>  said that this will involve more storage, better emails, inter-department communications, and also a maintenance agreement to keep our equipment up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2047.131s">So</a>  that's basically what I know about that computer purchase.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2049.533s">If</a>  we could just make a B paper that we get an update with regards to all of these items and what stage we're at, maybe on a bimonthly basis, so that we know in six months the emails <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2061.311s">will</a>  be up and running, and the flight department will have their new computer system. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2064.252s">And</a>  in four months, all the cruises are coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2067.753s">People</a>  from these departments do call each Councilor and ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2072.234s">So</a>  it would be nice to have a running update with regards to when this is being done, which RFPs are going out when, and when we're going to see all these come to fruition. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2083.456s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2083.696s">Vice</a>  President Mux. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2085.697s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2086.817s">And</a>  my question is regarding DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2091.401s">And</a>  I see that there are a lot of new pieces of equipment that we're moving forward with. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2098.891s">And</a>  I don't think anybody behind this reel would say that there isn't a need. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2104.038s">However,</a>  I do question, Mr. President, in the future would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2108.24s">when</a>  we do put a request out for such a dollar amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2112.484s">And</a>  by the way, just recently, the linkage committee, which you happen to sit on, Mr. President, just expended $435,000 on new equipment for DPW also, in addition to what's being spent here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2129.299s">So</a>  I think it would be helpful as one member of the council <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2132.922s">If</a>  we're going to put on a number of items and say, well, we're going to purchase a F-250 pickup truck, I think it would be helpful to know how many we currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2142.427s">Is</a>  this replacing a pickup truck or is this adding to the fleet of pickup trucks? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2147.169s">That</a>  way, at least we can make an informed decision when these things do come before us, Mr. President, because honestly, I have no idea whether we need <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2156.153s">a</a>  10-wheel dump truck or whether we need a 550 four-wheel drive dump truck or a cemetery backhoe. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2163.415s">And</a>  it would be helpful to get a little bit of narrative other than just the line item itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2169.497s">But</a>  if you can maybe go through them just rather quickly, Commissioner Kerins, just to let us know the particular piece of equipment, if it's replacing a piece of equipment or if it's just adding to the existing fleet.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2182.141s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2183.223s">Mr.</a>  Vice President, I can put it all in a nutshell. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2186.204s">Everything</a>  is a one for one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2188.844s">Now,</a>  case in point, there may be a pickup truck out there today. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2194.105s">We</a>  have all good intentions of churning in for one that's on this particular request sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2199.946s">Tomorrow,</a>  it could be another one due to a motor vehicle accident or something else, but there's no increase in the fleet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2207.662s">as</a>  far as what I call the rolling stock. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2210.612s">Backhoe</a>  for backhoe, pickup for pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2214.28s">It's</a>  when you might get into the specialized equipment, all right, that, you know, we may not, you know, have that particular kind of equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2222.646s">But</a>  everything that you have listed, you know, for my request is a one for one.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2228.23s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2228.871s">That's</a>  very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2229.671s">And</a>  maybe a narrative like that in the future would be very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2233.774s">Certainly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2234.335s">At</a>  least myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2235.655s">And</a>  just the last point I have, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2238.264s">There</a>  was a narrative at the end that said, with exception of the police items, the remaining were presented in the draft capital budget presented in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2249.453s">I</a>  assume the mayor is letting us know that this was part of the draft plan that was presented, capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2256.078s">And</a>  I would only ask, when are we going to get the full plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2259.46s">I</a>  don't think we should be working on a draft plan still this far into the fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2265.225s">And</a>  if there are any plans for a full capital plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2268.347s">out</a>  there, Mr. President, I think it's important that we find that out now, rather than working on a draft plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2274.07s">So</a>  I would ask that that be part of the committee.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2276.331s">I</a>  will bring that to the mayor's attention.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2278.152s">But</a>  I would also ask that it be part of the committee paper, Mr. President, that we get a response back from the administration regarding when a full capital budget plan will come out and why are we still working off a draft budget plan.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2291.579s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2292.66s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2293.74s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2294.461s">I</a>  actually have one more question for Commissioner Kearns. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2301.275s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2302.996s">So</a>  last year I had a resolution to buy a sidewalk plow, to look into buying a sidewalk plow. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2309.86s">Because</a>  we're trying to push a lot of pedestrian initiatives. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2314.223s">We</a>  have Walk Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2316.964s">We</a>  have a Complete Streets program now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2318.765s">So</a>  we're really trying to encourage people to get out, walk, be pedestrians, and use public transportation and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2326.53s">So</a>  I don't see anything here for a sidewalk plow. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2330.562s">It</a>  didn't make the cut, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2332.103s">But</a>  do we have any type of machinery right now that we could use to plow sidewalks in our community, especially city-owned sidewalks?</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2340.506s">It</a>  really would depend on the location and the width of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2346.528s">There</a>  are some sidewalks we can get one of our pickup trucks down and plow. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2352.11s">Other</a>  sidewalks, we'd have to use bobcats or snowblowers or a combination of both.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2360.172s">those</a>  can use like I would just like I mean I'm thinking like if I think of you know I think of like yeah like a bombardier or something like that a trackless plow you know because those things those type of plows and when I looked into it I mean it could zip right down a sidewalk especially in your uh you know your business communities <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2379.408s">With</a>  regard to schools, I remember when I was on the school committee, we get calls all the time where kids walking to school will be forced out into the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2386.593s">Like</a>  if you walk by Gillis Park down Fulton Street, you're walking to the Roberts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2389.855s">You're</a>  forced out into the street because it's a city-owned sidewalk, but there's no machinery that we really have to plow something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2396.44s">So</a>  I mean, I think it's something that should be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2398.501s">I</a>  wish I was on here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2401.043s">I'm</a>  happy with what's here, believe me, and I will vote for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2403.905s">And</a>  I'm 100% in favor of it, but I think it's something that we need to consider in the future.</p>

    <p>[Brian Kerins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2409.063s">And,</a>  you know, when we have, uh, you know, Councilor, uh, between, uh, you know, uh, the administrative office of public works and, uh, the, you know, the park foreman, Mr. Nesta, we've done extensive research as far as, uh, what types of equipment are out there, uh, that would be suitable for our sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2426.395s">Again,</a>  you know, we have to keep in consideration, you know, we have hydrants and poles and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2432.012s">So</a>  you get something too big, but at the same time something too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2437.457s">But</a>  it's really a case of trying to get something that would have the potential of being multi-seasonal to get, we'll say, like a bombardier. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2448.781s">All</a>  right, they're built for one purpose and one purpose only, to plow snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2453.144s">They're</a>  extremely expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2455.226s">You're</a>  talking in and around $90,000, OK, for something that, yes, you definitely would need if the snow was flying. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2465.453s">So</a>  we've been looking at the various options that are out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2469.536s">So</a>  even if it's a question, OK, of getting a trackless vehicle to plow the snow, but in the summertime, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2477.678s">okay,</a>  could be utilized for the maintenance, the upkeep of the baseball fields or football fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2482.859s">So,</a>  you know, we've been exploring, okay, what would be the biggest bang for the buck? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2488.801s">And</a>  then we will approach the mayor, you know, with the formal request and the reasons why we would need it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2495.943s">But</a>  something that, you know, 12 months of the year availability.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2500.264s">I</a>  agree with you 100%. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2501.324s">I</a>  mean, I know when I researched the trackless plow, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2504.284s">and</a>  it could be used to, there was one that could be used to grind stumps. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2510.949s">There</a>  were uses for, you know, summer, you could use it for hauling debris and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2515.972s">So,</a>  but hoping in the future that we'll see something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2520.215s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2520.956s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2522.897s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2524.038s">And</a>  the only thing we didn't talk about was the scanner copier that Cassandra has been asking for for many years, and she's not here to, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2534.53s">but</a>  again, at the last two budget seasons, that is something that she's looked for, and that will be in there also. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2541.973s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2543.034s">Move</a>  for question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2544.555s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2551.317s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2552.378s">My</a>  name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2557.86s">I</a>  don't have any problems with the requests that are being made, but my problem is in the process that's being presented here to you this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2565.735s">What</a>  seems to be unfamiliar is the fact that this present administration talked about this issue of inclusion and being a part of what's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2574.917s">You</a>  have the police, the forestry, the engineering department, the cemetery, the highway, and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2580.618s">Six</a>  departments that you folks, during budgetary time, have heard all of these concerns that are being presented here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2588.06s">And</a>  as a matter of fact, it goes back to the times when I served in this body where some of these issues were there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2593.283s">This</a>  money is coming out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2595.445s">And</a>  because it's coming out of free cash, which was asked for before, you folks were told, or we were told, as well as you folks were told, at some point in time, we can't use it because it might have an effect upon the bond rating here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2607.315s">Now,</a>  all of a sudden, it's coming out as a $1,100,000 transfer of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2613.2s">And</a>  tomorrow night, Madam Mayor is going to be making her presentation for the State of the City's Address. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2620.357s">My</a>  concern would be if there are more things that are going to be coming that's going to have a cost impact upon not only free cash or maybe even bonding, I think before this vote takes place, I think it probably should be laid on the table for one week, as Councilor Lungo-Koehn rightly did some weeks ago on the request of the $900,000 to have some transfer of money from the Water and Sewer Account to pay for the remediation of the West Medford parking lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2646.471s">Now,</a>  you folks have your own rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2648.805s">and</a>  it's rule number 20, section number four, which states that any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2662.451s">I</a>  would think it would be wise by this city council, I'm not saying for you to not vote for it or vote for it, I think it would be wise to lay it on the table for a week and just see what's going to be presented tomorrow night in the state of the city's address. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2674.396s">You</a>  folks, unfortunately, have been kept not in the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2678.427s">Everything</a>  that's being presented here has nothing to do with you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2681.829s">You</a>  folks have never met with all the department heads to go through their wish lists. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2686.332s">That</a>  was something that was discussed during this past election, and it still hasn't taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2691.235s">A</a>  magnificence of $1 million here tonight, and the mayor's representative is not here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2697.239s">That</a>  doesn't speak well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2699.32s">One</a>  information council tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2700.501s">I</a>  believe the mayor has four representatives here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2703.372s">The</a>  mayor's liaison to the City Council is not here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2706.974s">Department</a>  heads might be here, but they're not the ones that bring the message back. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2710.675s">You</a>  know, when you go back and you look at some of these things and you say to yourself, the chief of police just thought through saying six cruises, six new, six regular cars and six cars that are going to be unmarked. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2722.001s">I</a>  think this council in the past has asked for each and every year, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2725.046s">Chief,</a>  you can correct me, for a minimum of two new cars each and every year in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2729.427s">This</a>  should have been, you folks should have been dealing with this within the past year, if not more. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2733.948s">And</a>  you're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2734.908s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2735.528s">My</a>  opinion, and it's election year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2737.308s">And</a>  you're getting all this confronted in front of you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2739.469s">You're</a>  gonna be getting sidewalks, you're gonna be getting streets, all done. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2743.269s">But</a>  where was this money not being used during this past year? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2746.99s">During</a>  a year which people had to suffer to go through this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2750.131s">Why</a>  should the fire department have to wait? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2752.663s">on</a>  their turnaround gear that they were promised not only last year but the year before. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2756.628s">And</a>  now all of a sudden it's found in a free cash supplement when it could have been at the same time taken out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2763.075s">It</a>  could have been taken out as of January 1st with the new administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2767.24s">The</a>  politics behind this is quite obvious. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2769.783s">But</a>  even more to the politics of it is tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2773.157s">My</a>  suggestion would be to wait until tomorrow night, see what this address is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2777.222s">And</a>  if the address has inclusions of other transfers of money or monies that have to go out for the purposes of being bonded, I think you really need to have a discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2786.833s">And</a>  you, Mr. President, you know, amongst this council, there's $210,000 a year paid in salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2793.367s">The</a>  executive office, the mayor only gets paid $140,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2797.67s">So</a>  there's more power strength here by what you are getting paid than what that corner office is getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2803.874s">And</a>  you should put that to use. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2805.615s">And</a>  if four of you get together and saying, hey, before we start expending these monies, just right off the hat, Councilor Marks, you've asked for two years in a row for a truck division within the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2816.443s">Nowhere</a>  is that found here, and nowhere is it found in the capital improvement plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2821.246s">Think</a>  about it, in today's day and age, you're talking about email now being in the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2826.85s">I</a>  don't even know if they have email in the police department, but if the fire department is now getting email, and they're supposed to be technologically up to snuff here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2835.096s">We</a>  should have the gentleman who runs your computer system down here, and he should be questioned as to what are the problems, and what is the technology needed within this city of Medford, whether it be the fire department, school department, or the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2847.91s">You</a>  haven't had that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2850.031s">There's</a>  a wishlist that goes out every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2852.273s">The</a>  wishlist is never even addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2854.474s">You</a>  just got through, Mr. President, talking about the scanner to the OCD, I mean, excuse me, the engineering office asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2860.597s">It's</a>  a simple little request that could have come right out of free cash last year, two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2865.66s">As</a>  a matter of fact, when the lady was there and she made her presentation before the council, she showed you emails that were sent, emails that were sent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2874.755s">that</a>  the administration wouldn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2876.976s">So</a>  what's being obvious is the fact that you're being asked to do something tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2881.558s">To</a>  me, it looks like you're being squirreled into a corner, that if you don't vote for it, you're bad, and you're not doing what you've all been asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2888.462s">That's</a>  not what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2889.742s">What</a>  I'm saying is you have one more night to wait and see. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2892.864s">I</a>  don't see this as being such an emergency that it needs to be voted on tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2897.046s">Your</a>  own council rule says the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2899.847s">Lay</a>  it on the table for one week, and if it comes out to be the same when you want to vote for it, go right ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2904.9s">But</a>  tomorrow night, if the State of the Union address is going to have something that has another financial impact within this community, whether it's coming off of your free cash or a bond or whatever it might be, don't you think you owe it to yourselves as legislative representatives and to the people of this community to wait and see? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2924.125s">You've</a>  waited all this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2926.567s">Pieces</a>  have been taken out of a capital improvement program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2930.029s">All</a>  of a sudden, things that you've been asking for just coincidentally happens to be in your agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2935.833s">Well,</a>  I don't think that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2937.174s">And</a>  I think all seven of you should have been brought in to fold, whether you agree with the mayor or you don't agree with the mayor, whether she agrees with you or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2944.536s">This</a>  is an important issue, many important issues here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2947.678s">This</a>  isn't $10,000 or $15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2950.08s">This</a>  is a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2951.4s">And</a>  the remaining balance of $8,600,000 is still there to be played with. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2957.184s">And</a>  you have no idea what she's going to do with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2959.686s">That's</a>  up to you folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2961.127s">And</a>  if you folks can't put the mayor together and force that lady to sit down and talk with you, to turn around and say, hey, you may be picking out things that you need, but that's not what this council sees and hears from Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2974.593s">I</a>  just respectfully state to you, follow your own council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2978.075s">Hopefully</a>  one of you will lay it on the table for one week, see what comes out tomorrow night, and recognize the fact that whatever your issues might be, they're addressed before this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2987.641s">You</a>  know, you have a capital improvement program here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2989.822s">There's</a>  a lot of things in this capital improvement program that also relates back to the fire department, the police department, some of them are in the school department, and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2996.927s">It</a>  would be nice to know <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=2999.538s">Whether</a>  a new police department is going to end the offering for tomorrow night, there's $2 million in there to figure out where they're going to put it, draw it, and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3007.302s">If</a>  you have sat down and talked with her or her people, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3010.503s">And</a>  I think you should. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3011.924s">It's</a>  the most pressing issue, the biggest, most pressing issue here financially for the city of Medford, and no discussion on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3018.808s">But</a>  you're getting over $1 million worth of transfers being asked for tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3022.95s">Again,</a>  I repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3024.04s">I</a>  am not against any of these transfers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3025.781s">What</a>  I'm against is the process, how it's being presented, and the opportunity you have to make sure that before you vote for this, you see the complete and total picture, which I believe will be presented tomorrow evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3036.025s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3036.445s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3036.805s">During</a>  budget time, everyone did ask every department for their wish list.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3041.347s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3042.307s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3043.608s">My</a>  name is Paul Camuso of 114 Lincoln Road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3047.069s">And</a>  it sort of seems like deja vu. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3049.951s">But,</a>  Mr. President, I just wanted to come down this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3053.612s">You</a>  know, the men and women of the police department, the fire department, this is public safety equipment that's before this honorable body this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3062.396s">You</a>  know, the Boston Marathon bombing, we didn't know it was going to happen that beautiful day in April. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3069.158s">The</a>  fire where there was about five people that passed away down in South Medford, 25 yards from the firehouse, we didn't know that was going to happen that day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3081.305s">By</a>  laying this on the table one more week or two more weeks, I really believe it's an injustice to the men and women that protect our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3090.247s">You</a>  know, week after week, we're talking about things down here that are needed in this community to better the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3097.188s">And</a>  this is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3101.449s">You</a>  know, the former councilor just referred to the salaries that city councilors are paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3107.55s">You</a>  guys do a tremendous job for the money that you make. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3112.324s">The</a>  collections this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3113.806s">I</a>  know you guys are working hard with collections to bring in money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3117.071s">There's</a>  a lot of money out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3118.493s">There's</a>  over $9 million in certified free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3121.216s">This</a>  community is stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3122.939s">This</a>  community is thriving, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3126.702s">And</a>  I think it's about time that you take a hard vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3129.583s">You</a>  spend the money to buy those 12 new cruisers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3132.483s">You</a>  spend the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3133.404s">Give</a>  the fire department the gear that they need to protect themselves, property, and community standards. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3139.505s">The</a>  NFPA, the NFPA says you need a second set of turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3145.646s">We</a>  only have about three or four people in the department right now that may have second and third turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3151.008s">And</a>  some of those are outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3152.068s">Correct,</a>  Chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3153.513s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3154.594s">So</a>  to wait any longer, to wait any longer, to let anybody get in the way of taking the vote for the men and women of the Medford Police Department, the Medford Fire Department, and the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3163.584s">And</a>  I sort of single out the Medford Police and Fire Department this evening a little bit more than the other departments, because it is life or death when it comes to them, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3174.81s">And</a>  I often, I remember when I was sitting here as an honorable member of this council, and somebody questioned Medford's use of money to get the proper equipment for the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3186.407s">And</a>  it was shortly thereafter that down in Watertown, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3190.742s">in</a>  Watertown on that cold April night when they had shootouts and the bombings that were getting thrown at police officers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3198.605s">And</a>  very easily that could have came north on Route 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3202.987s">And</a>  Chief Gilberti could have got the phone call at his house at 1.30 in the morning and we could have had it going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3210.05s">You</a>  know, to wait is an injustice to the men and women and also to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3216.033s">And</a>  on top of that, the DPW does need the equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3220.169s">Go</a>  up the cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3221.23s">We</a>  have a thriving cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3222.772s">They're</a>  actually doing well up there because people want to stay in our cemetery, in our community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3229.779s">I</a>  know Councilor Marks has been fought for quite some time now for a mausoleum. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3234.502s">I</a>  know that that's been on the plate up there, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3239.045s">So</a>  there's just a lot of good stuff going on in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3242.008s">And</a>  I think if you wait one week, I think it's definitely not in the best interests of the men and women. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3247.412s">And</a>  here's the other thing, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3248.973s">We</a>  heard the young lady over here and the Commissioner talking about, this isn't a fly-by-night thing like some people would want you to think. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3258.66s">There</a>  has been price quotations that have been sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3261.772s">They're</a>  coming now with a responsible package with the dollar amount that's going to be needed for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3267.197s">And</a>  furthermore, I find it kind of ironic because this city council as a whole, including myself over the years, have always said, let's do it with certified free cash and not bonding. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3277.806s">Because</a>  the former mayor was a big fan of bonding and financing equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3283.571s">And</a>  he was very, very good at his job doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3286.533s">But</a>  here we are this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3289.883s">We're</a>  looking at spending certified free cash, which I can go back and watch millions of council tapes over the past 30 plus years that the council always <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3299.029s">preferred,</a>  the preferred method, as far as the council was doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3303.151s">So</a>  I just want to say, I respectfully ask all of the members of the council to support this unanimously and get behind the men and women of the police department and the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3312.276s">You</a>  know, these are the simple things that they need to do their jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3315.558s">And</a>  it's great being down here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3317.679s">And</a>  thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this body.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3319.98s">And</a>  there's nothing on this list that's not deserved or needed by the department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3324.603s">Councilor</a>  Knight, show the main question that we put, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3328.186s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Layton, Councilor Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3330.507s">Mr.</a>  President, I made the motion for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3332.889s">I</a>  stand by my motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3334.069s">I</a>  won't be manipulated by political agendas.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3337.071s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3340.153s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3342.214s">I</a>  just want to correct the record for a minute here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3345.996s">It</a>  was in June of 2016, we as a council started meeting with department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3353.212s">uh...</a>  prior to uh... the budget and we sat down in department heads came before us with wish list what they wanted to see in the budget and uh... if i'm not mistaken every council behind this reeling brought up these same exact concerns that we're seeing here tonight eight months ago but now we're hearing tonight it would be an injustice if we waited another week to move this forward <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3383.84s">But</a>  these issues were brought forward eight months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3388.164s">So</a>  was that an injustice for the past eight months? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3391.087s">Why</a>  these issues weren't moved forward? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3393.289s">I</a>  don't know, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3395.211s">But</a>  this party, Mr. President, has stated time and time again, and I have stated time and time again, I refuse to do business piecemeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3404.039s">And</a>  we've been saying that year after year after year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3406.842s">It</a>  doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3408.656s">from</a>  a financial standpoint or a managerial standpoint to do business piecemeal, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3415.822s">I</a>  will support these items here tonight only for the fact, Mr. President, is that these issues have been on our agenda and on our plate, turnout gear for almost two years now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3427.852s">So</a>  these aren't new items. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3429.934s">And</a>  I appreciate Councilor Penta coming up and Councilor Camuso <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3434.654s">Um,</a>  it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3435.275s">We</a>  have, uh, how many councils? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3436.976s">We</a>  have nine councils in the room tonight.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3440.339s">That's</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3441.54s">Uh,</a>  Mr. President, we should get all the other past ones to come down also. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3446.365s">But</a>  I would state, Mr. President, that, um, moving forward and to me, it doesn't matter the state of the city speech tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3454.592s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3455.393s">And</a>  I hope it works out for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3457.175s">But</a>  I'm not hinging my vote on the mayor's speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3459.977s">tomorrow</a>  night, because these are items I believe we have to move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3463.803s">But</a>  after this, Mr. President, I do believe, as was mentioned by Councilor Penta, we have to have not just a draft capital plan, but a plan on the direction we want to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3474.779s">Because</a>  at some point, we're going to be pitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3477.121s">Hey,</a>  you want to spend for this, or are you going to spend for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3480.443s">And</a>  I think we should have a vision as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3483.426s">We</a>  may not share the same vision with the mayor, but as a council, we should have a vision and the direction we want to see this city move. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3490.931s">And,</a>  you know, like I said, I'm prepared to vote on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3494.574s">These</a>  things are well warranted. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3496.375s">We</a>  know the DPW, you see their trucks driving around, their blades are all chewed up, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3502.848s">The</a>  equipment is old and outdated. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3505.57s">And</a>  this is a way to replenish it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3507.351s">I've</a>  talked to the men and women in the police department that are driving around in cruises, as I referred to a couple of weeks ago, Fred Flintstone vehicles, where you could put your feet through the floorboards. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3518.217s">That's</a>  how bad some of these vehicles are getting, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3521.398s">And</a>  that's not a joke. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3523.219s">So</a>  we do need relief in this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3525.761s">I</a>  think this will go a long way, the turnout gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3528.485s">We</a>  heard from the chief of the fire department stating a few weeks back that when these firefighters are in a fire, they come back with the same gear. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3538.768s">They</a>  have to wait for one washing machine that is specially used to wash this equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3547.182s">So</a>  they have to wait in line to use the equipment and they don't have a second gear, God forbid, there's a second fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3553.403s">And</a>  we all know the carcinogens and so forth that from a fire that can, the soot and everything else that goes on the uniform, it's very dangerous for the brave men and women of the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3563.486s">So,</a>  you know, I don't want anyone to believe that if this council did sit on this for a week, that we're sitting on public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3570.327s">because</a>  these issues have been out here for months, and if not years, and it's not this council that's been sitting on anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3577.353s">This</a>  council has been the advocate on behalf of the police, DPW, and fire department in this community, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Leo Sacco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3629.59s">Mr.</a>  President, I just wanted to say thank you very much for your vote here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3632.692s">It</a>  means a lot to the men and women of the Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3635.334s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3636.115s">Thank</a>  you, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3639.697s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3641.038s">Paper</a>  17-061, offered by President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3646.382s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the Mayor allocate funds <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3651.2s">so</a>  that we are able to put names of the seven Method veterans on the plaques at Honor Roll Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3656.965s">We</a>  would like to attempt to have this done by Memorial Day in May so that a ceremony could be held the day or by the Veterans Day in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3666.433s">Council</a>  President Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3668.695s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3670.556s">Mr.</a>  Vice President, this is something <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3674.174s">There's</a>  some World War II veterans that are on the list there that have been there for a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3679.298s">I</a>  think there's only like seven or eight names on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3681.92s">And</a>  these World War II veterans are getting old and I think they'd like to see their name on the wall before they pass away. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3690.366s">So</a>  if we could ask the mayor to find some funding and some budget or somewhere to get those seven or eight names on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3699.212s">And</a>  if we could also maybe put an ad in the paper for any other veterans that <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3703.847s">may</a>  be missed out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3706.21s">So</a>  if we could do that, it would be very helpful, especially to the World War II veterans who are passing it at 1,000 a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3714.862s">So</a>  I ask that to the mayor.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3717.325s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3718.246s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3719.48s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, thank you very much for bringing this resolution forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3723.385s">And</a>  I really think this is an important issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3726.288s">I</a>  have brought a resolution of similar nature up in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3729.592s">And</a>  ultimately, these men and women didn't wait, didn't tell us to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3734.383s">when</a>  we needed them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3735.383s">They</a>  enlisted in the armed services, and they went overseas, and they fought for their country. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3739.924s">And</a>  I really think that this should be done annually, Mr. President, on Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3743.105s">I</a>  think every Memorial Day, they should be adding names to the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3745.985s">If</a>  there's one eligible applicant whose name is eligible to be on that list, then every Memorial Day, we should be doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3752.606s">These</a>  individuals didn't tell us to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3754.527s">We</a>  shouldn't be telling them to wait, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3756.227s">I</a>  support Councilor Caraviello's resolution wholeheartedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3758.947s">I'd</a>  ask that it be amended and ask the mayor to implement an annual celebration on Memorial Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3763.228s">where</a>  any eligible individuals can be added to the plaque, regardless of the number of individuals that are awaiting placement on a roll pack, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3771.034s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3771.755s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3773.236s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3774.537s">I,</a>  too, echo my colleague's remarks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3779.0s">I</a>  think that we all have someone that has talked to us in the past year with myself and the men and women that fought for our country. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3790.407s">And</a>  for some families that have really pushed this, it's been frightening for the fact that they're seeing their loved ones who fought for our country enter their final stages of their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3806.617s">And</a>  one thing they want to see is the honor of having their names put on that wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3812.901s">So</a>  if there's anything that, if we can really push this through and make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3818.681s">We</a>  can make this happen for our men and women, and I echo Councilor Knight's remarks that this is something we should do every year because you never know what tomorrow brings. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3828.244s">So</a>  I really appreciate Councilor Caraviello for bringing this up, and thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=3833.906s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4005.024s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4005.484s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4006.805s">First</a>  of all, I'd like to thank sincere thanks to Chief Sacco and the <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4010.884s">command</a>  staff and the men and women that work in the Medford Police Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4015.147s">We</a>  had a most recent community meeting this past Wednesday at Breed Hall, the old Sacred Heart Church up in the hillside. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4024.412s">And</a>  this was an issue that came up during that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4028.035s">The</a>  postal trucks that park outside of the Medford Postal Office, basically every night they line up on-</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4041.009s">Mr.</a>  Cassidy, if you could, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4043.211s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4044.232s">I'm</a>  sorry, Mr. Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4045.973s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4047.434s">Basically,</a>  every night they line up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4049.056s">They</a>  park on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4050.957s">They're</a>  big, bulky trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4052.178s">So</a>  for anyone that lives in the old Medford High School condominiums, it's really hard to navigate that area and to get out of the parking lot in the morning and at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4062.146s">So</a>  it's become a bit of a safety hazard. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4065.189s">So</a>  if we could just, if the chief and the mayor reach out to the US Postal Service, the Medford branch, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4071.182s">And</a>  just find out, I guess, what the strategy is with regard to those trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4078.008s">Because</a>  it seems like over the years from what I'm hearing, there's more and more trucks all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4083.313s">It</a>  used to be just a few. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4084.274s">Now</a>  there's a bunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4085.515s">I</a>  went down Forest Street on Sunday morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4088.878s">They</a>  were all lined up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4091.32s">They</a>  took all the parking spaces in front of the old Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4094.841s">If</a>  we could find out if they have plans to actually find additional parking somewhere in the city for these vehicles, because it's becoming a safety hazard and something needs to be done about it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4103.505s">I</a>  can report that I did go down to the post office to meet with the postal manager and the new manager was out sick for the last two days and hopefully when I go back tomorrow, because I go there every day, she will be in and I've asked that maybe we could have a meeting to try to find some resolution on where to park the trucks.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4120.932s">Thank</a>  you, and if I may, Mr. President, I believe there is a member of the community that would like to speak on this issue, or maybe a few.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4131.338s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4131.679s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4132.819s">Good</a>  evening, President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4134.42s">I'm</a>  Sharon Diesso, 130 Circuit Road in Mass Ave in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4139.283s">I</a>  want to wish you a belated healthy new year, and thank you for your time for 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4144.226s">I</a>  just had a couple of small matters that I wanted to bring up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4149.248s">One</a>  you have to kind of verse me on because I'm not sure how the system works and learning things from different meetings and hearing Councilor Pinter in Camuso, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4159.954s">First</a>  of all, for a community that's well known on the map, my neighbors and I had to wait seven years for a strategic stop sign down by Ashcroft Road.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4172.92s">Could</a>  I interrupt you? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4174.301s">We're</a>  talking about the post office right at the moment.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4176.747s">Oh,</a>  I thought you were finished.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4177.808s">We're</a>  talking about the post office. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4179.249s">If</a>  you'd like to come back later and speak.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4180.79s">Oh,</a>  sure.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4182.572s">Yeah,</a>  so, okay.</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4186.595s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4192.219s">Good</a>  evening, John Costas, 25 Salem Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4196.122s">And</a>  that's a sore subject with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4200.226s">I</a>  mean, you just brought it up now, but I've been dealing with that for over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4205.361s">It</a>  started out as one truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4207.481s">They</a>  used to park in the theater parking lot, and then they were gracious enough to park it in front of their own post office. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4213.946s">As</a>  time goes on, as of November, there were 16 post office trucks parked from one end of Forest Street to the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4223.072s">And</a>  it's not like they're only there at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4225.874s">Some</a>  of these trucks are there for three, four days, and they never move. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4230.778s">Case</a>  in point, Mayor Burke's been trying to help us on it, because we've been getting a lot of complaints from the renters, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4237.498s">You</a>  can't see the theater when there's five trucks parked in front of the theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4241.361s">And</a>  we try to tell the post office and they yeast me to death. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4245.445s">Sometimes</a>  they move and sometimes they don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4248.187s">Well,</a>  this year Mayor Burke had spoken with the manager and gave them a solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4253.512s">Because</a>  every time I talked to the post office manager, their complaint was, well, what do you want us to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4259.577s">We</a>  have no place for the trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4261.639s">They</a>  have to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4263.687s">Why</a>  don't we park them in West Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4265.389s">They</a>  had behind the post office. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4267.671s">Well,</a>  they don't want to drive that far. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4270.433s">So</a>  they seem to think that it's the Medford's responsibility to park their 15 trucks as they have no place to put them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4279.541s">Mayor</a>  Burkett offered them behind city hall here at night, as long as they were gone in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4286.527s">So</a>  the parking lot could be used. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4288.99s">If</a>  anybody ever noticed in the past month, there's been a truck there that hasn't moved all month. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4295.533s">And</a>  there was another truck there for three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4298.474s">They</a>  don't use it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4299.354s">Don't</a>  know why it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4300.435s">Don't</a>  know why they lease these vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4302.015s">A</a>  lot has to do with the new Amazon. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4305.897s">I</a>  mean, I thought that the answer the city came up with was a very reasonable, fair, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4311.805s">Response,</a>  okay, U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4313.506s">Post</a>  Office, you got an issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4315.847s">Let's</a>  help you fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4317.327s">We</a>  don't want you parking all your trucks on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4321.369s">They</a>  don't belong there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4322.349s">However,</a>  we're nice people here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4325.351s">We're</a>  gonna give you public property. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4327.632s">All</a>  you have to do is park your trucks there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4331.193s">And</a>  one time when we had some big events at the theater, all their trucks were parked behind here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4336.521s">It</a>  was wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4337.322s">If</a>  you ever noticed that a couple of weekends, there were no U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4340.484s">Postal</a>  Trucks overnight on Forest Street because they were here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4344.366s">But</a>  after about two days, they're back on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4348.309s">And</a>  unless you ask them to move it, they may or may not get the word to the driver's case in point on the KPM Big Bend, they agreed to park them here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4359.756s">Well,</a>  there were three that was parking in front of the theater that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4362.981s">And</a>  I stopped them, I said, you can't park here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4364.903s">We've</a>  got the OK, you need to park over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4366.766s">And</a>  they said, well, no one told us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4369.269s">I</a>  said, well, why don't you call your manager, because you're not supposed to park here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4373.273s">And</a>  they had to call the manager, and the manager forgot to tell them, don't park on Forest Street on that Saturday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4380.848s">So</a>  they moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4381.929s">They</a>  moved and everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4383.249s">So</a>  whatever you can do, I know the mayor is trying, but it's a post office and I think you have to use a little more. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4390.933s">I</a>  think it's going to be more than just have another meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4394.095s">We've</a>  had meetings and it works for a little while and then they just go back to their old ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4399.498s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4401.079s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4401.419s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4402.359s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4403.82s">Councilor</a>  Lococo.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4406.423s">I</a>  was just going to second the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4408.385s">I've</a>  received a number of complaints, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4410.126s">And</a>  I was also going to ask if it's something that's been happening lately, because I've noticed it a lot on Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4417.152s">But</a>  I think Mr. Costa just confirmed November. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4419.954s">It's</a>  gotten worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4421.296s">It's</a>  gotten a lot worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4422.357s">And</a>  yeah, it's terrible to be blocking the Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4425.119s">And</a>  I did get complaints from people that live in the old high school that are having trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4430.043s">So</a>  I just wanted to back you up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4431.504s">I</a>  think the mayor needs to figure something out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4433.94s">with</a>  regards to asking the post office to create their own plan, whether if they're going to have trucks that are out of service for months at a time, then they do need to take them across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4443.628s">It's</a>  only about five minutes, seven minutes to West Medford and park it where there is a lot or figure out how to use the city hall parking lot that the mayor is graciously offering. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4452.495s">But</a>  they do need to come up with a plan for public safety purposes.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4456.587s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lockhart. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4457.788s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4458.888s">Mr.</a>  President, I move to amend the paper to request that the Traffic Commission examine the feasibility of implementing a commercial vehicle parking ban along Forest Street.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4468.874s">That</a>  the Traffic Commission study the matter.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4473.036s">Examine</a>  the feasibility, not implement, just examine it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4475.377s">Look,</a>  if that's something that's possible that they can do, can they put a commercial parking ban in place there in front of the Chevalier Auditorium, maybe a little bit further out in front of the old high school to alleviate some of the public safety concerns? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4485.207s">whether</a>  it's certain spaces that are at the end of a driveway or certain spaces that are in front of the theater, Mr. President, to keep those areas open.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4493.997s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4494.998s">Vice</a>  President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4496.62s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4497.721s">And</a>  just to touch upon what Councilor Knight just mentioned, there is a parking ban for commercial vehicles after midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4504.629s">Yes,</a>  there is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4505.547s">So</a>  I'm not sure I would consider these postal trucks commercial vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4511.131s">They</a>  may not have a commercial plate, but they are indeed commercial vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4514.974s">And</a>  maybe that may be our plan of attack, Mr. President, is to, you know, start tagging these vehicles like we tag any other commercial vehicle that's overnight and see what the response is from the Postal Department. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4527.528s">As</a>  was mentioned by Mr. Costas, this has been an issue for a lot, a lot of months, many, many months. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4534.591s">And</a>  I thought it was resolved some months back when the mayor intervened and offered the parking out here behind City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4543.414s">I'm</a>  not sure how postal workers that walk for a living can say they don't want to walk behind City Hall from Forest Street, but <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4552.795s">You</a>  know, maybe if that's too far, maybe we can look at the public lot right on Salem Street, Mr. President, where many of the postal workers park during the day with the business permit parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4563.378s">So,</a>  that may be an alternative to park the trucks in there overnight, which is a little closer than behind City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4569.18s">So,</a>  maybe we can offer that also, Mr. President, as a...

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4616.555s">Sharon</a>  Dias of 130 Circuit Road in Mass Ave., in Redford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4622.163s">I</a>  just wanted to say, first of all, even before the sign issue, I wanted to thank, and I got a chance to do it in person, the fine fire department that we have here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4632.757s">There</a>  were some things I'm sort of not touchy-feely with at home, and I had a bleep going off in the house last week, and I finally tracked it down to the carbon monoxide device. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4642.925s">So</a>  I pulled it out of the wall, and five minutes later, it started bleeping again on a chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4648.85s">So</a>  I'm like, okay, this is kind of spooky, but maybe I should plug it back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4654.942s">And</a>  it bleeped again. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4656.303s">So</a>  I said, maybe, and I called the neighbor and I said, I think I'm going to have to sleep with my windows open tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4661.569s">And</a>  they said, no, don't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4663.331s">So</a>  I called the fire department, left the device on the front porch, and it started bleeping on the front porch. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4669.757s">So</a>  up they came five minutes later, the old trusty guys with the boots and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4675.022s">And</a>  they went right through my house, very courteously, did their job with the monitors, explained, you know, something to me about the device, and made sure I checked and see if I was okay, and then they left. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4687.531s">So</a>  thank you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4688.412s">I</a>  just happened to see him here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4690.754s">Good</a>  timing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4691.794s">So</a>  we have some really fine police and people who are looking for our safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4697.278s">So</a>  on the line of safety, I have two notes tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4702.422s">It's</a>  highly unordinary. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4704.45s">that</a>  a very busy corner that is complained about, written about, called about, written about, met about, should wait seven years for a stop sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4713.833s">I</a>  think it's unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4716.394s">And</a>  Ashcroft Road.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4717.174s">Which</a>  street was that?</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4718.094s">Ashcroft</a>  Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4718.894s">Sorry?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4720.335s">Ashcroft</a>  Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4721.255s">Ashcroft</a>  Road? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4721.855s">Yeah,</a>  in corner of Mass Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4724.296s">It's</a>  in now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4725.556s">So</a>  we kind of gave up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4727.697s">So</a>  about two weeks ago, I was coming home and I saw the stop sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4732.168s">So</a>  thank you, whoever did in the end, after my letters, get it in, it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4738.03s">But</a>  on the whole light of everything, that's not acceptable in any city, whether it be Kalamazoo or Medford, Massachusetts, it's been a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4746.993s">We're</a>  waiting for someone, hopefully never to get hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4750.254s">My</a>  neighbor's car was totaled on that corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4753.656s">We</a>  were hoping that no child or pedestrian would be involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4757.897s">So</a>  thanks again for anyone who did speak <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4761.291s">I</a>  can't say speed it up, who accomplished this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4764.532s">On</a>  Mystic Avenue, on the grounds of safety, coming north or going south, right by Joseph's Transportation, there is an island there that's about five inches high, and it borders, it's the meridian. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4781.337s">If</a>  you're going north on Mystic Avenue from Somerville, you have to take a turn towards the left to kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4790.023s">get</a>  by that island, you can go make a U-turn, take a left onto Harvard, you can't go straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4795.707s">You</a>  can't see the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4797.528s">You</a>  dearly need reflectors there, because I was waiting for this too to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4804.053s">Last</a>  week I was coming home from the college, and it might usually have fog at the end of the day, and I'm like, oh, remember the island, you have to watch for it, because it's not visible. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4815.004s">A</a>  man coming the other way, not at a high speed, took the turn, never saw the island, landed on the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4821.429s">People</a>  were yelling, and the poor guy was beside himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4825.552s">Everyone</a>  stopped. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4826.793s">He</a>  was able to back off. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4828.535s">He</a>  looked a little dazed, and then he went around, past Dunkin' Donuts and Harrows, and then proceeded south on Mystic Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4836.901s">Is</a>  that state, or is that section of the road Medford?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4840.404s">That</a>  is a state road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4841.485s">It</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4842.466s">So</a>  what's the next route for me?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4844.127s">We</a>  can refer that to Councilor, I think Councilor Barber, I mean Representative Barber, that's her district, and I can call her tomorrow and make that request.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Deyeso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4853.43s">Especially</a>  with the snow coming, they're probably going to have to put the newer, higher reflectors. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4857.551s">I</a>  hope you're in agreement with this, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4860.692s">Also,</a>  on monies, I was reading during the year that to get finalized that you had a commission that was paid <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4869.78s">to</a>  look at the structure that's across from the bus terminal near the old cemetery. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4876.263s">And</a>  that's going to be pot grant money in pot, $250,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4879.264s">That's</a>  a quarter of a million dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4880.805s">That's</a>  250 quarters of taxpayers, maybe $1,000 a quarter, to erect something there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4891.29s">where</a>  people can eat their lunch. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4893.15s">This</a>  is winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4894.231s">How</a>  many people do you really think are going to go in there and eat lunch? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4897.591s">It</a>  is beside my friends and I how things like this get passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4902.052s">How</a>  many cruises could have been bought during the years with $250,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4907.093s">Just</a>  because you get a grant and somebody has an idea that the structure hasn't been used, you know, we respect you so much and we need you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4914.875s">You're</a>  our voices. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4916.413s">But</a>  couldn't that money be allocated at one time? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4918.734s">Couldn't</a>  someone come forth and say, wait a minute, we have a better place to spend $250,000, and I was here last year when the police chief was coming up practically begging for new equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4930.077s">This</a>  could have been processed, and these gentlemen would not have to have been here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4935.439s">So</a>  I don't know if that's possible, if you can rethink money during the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4939.961s">I</a>  really think if you had a leak in your roof, you wouldn't go fix your shed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4944.482s">So,</a>  thank you for listening to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4946.484s">I'm</a>  just a peon when it comes to economics.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4949.046s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4949.686s">And</a>  I will speak to Representative Bobbitt tomorrow about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4952.749s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4953.109s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4953.87s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Lungo-Koehnan to revert back to regular business. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4959.682s">16-0-6,</a>  17-0-6-3, offered by Councilor Falco, whereas the Medford Board of Appeals meets on a monthly basis to make decisions about various projects and developments, whereas many of the meetings are conducted in room 201 in Medford City Hall, where there is a limited amount of seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4980.248s">Be</a>  it resolved that moving forward that all Medford Board of Appeals meetings take place in all the chambers at City Hall to give all residents <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4989.192s">the</a>  opportunity to attend and to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4991.955s">Councilor</a>  Belko.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4993.997s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=4994.919s">Throughout</a>  the years, I've gone to many Board of Appeals meetings just to see different, just to, you know, when the different issues come up on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5007.346s">just</a>  go down and take a look to see what's going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5010.447s">And</a>  I've gotten calls from other people as well that have attended these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5014.608s">And</a>  usually, the meetings are held in room 201, for the most part. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5019.19s">And</a>  in room 201, there's very limited seating. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5022.611s">I</a>  think it's about maybe 20 seats, a table up in the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5026.512s">And</a>  it seems like any meeting you go to, if there's a big issue, there are a number of people just standing in the hallways. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5032.574s">They</a>  can't weigh in on any type of issue, or they have to wait in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5037.237s">or</a>  they miss the presentation that maybe the developer's giving, and it just doesn't seem, in this day and age, like it's a proper place to have a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5047.186s">There's</a>  no audio-visual equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5049.248s">It's</a>  just too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5051.77s">I</a>  don't find it very transparent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5053.112s">If</a>  you have to wait in the hallway, and you can't even hear what's going on in the room, it doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5058.096s">We</a>  live in a big city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5059.558s">Over</a>  55,000, close to 60,000 people live here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5064.272s">This</a>  community is hot for development. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5066.513s">People</a>  want to develop. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5068.114s">And</a>  there are many development meetings and zoning board decisions that have happened in the past, and that will be happening in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5075.418s">And</a>  everyone should be able to weigh in on these different issues that come before the zoning board. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5083.662s">If</a>  I may finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5086.688s">So</a>  in my opinion, I believe that those meetings should be held here in chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5091.732s">I</a>  know they meet on Tuesday night usually, which is the same night as us. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5094.634s">But</a>  what they can do is maybe they can move to Wednesday nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5098.357s">They</a>  can pick a different night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5099.818s">Wednesday</a>  nights, I don't think this chamber is being used on a regular basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5103.201s">But</a>  it needs to be looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5105.287s">We</a>  need to make this process, we need to bring the process into the 21st century where people can come, if there's a presentation, they can use the AV equipment here, but it shouldn't be in a room where you can barely fit 20 people and people feel like they're excluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5120.258s">You</a>  know, government should be transparent, that's what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5123.621s">People</a>  should have access, and I think this would be a better venue.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5126.743s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5127.103s">I</a>  think the question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5128.414s">the</a>  meeting should be moved to Wednesday night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5129.835s">So</a>  because the Board of Heals does meet on a Tuesday evening, the same as we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5134.319s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5136.721s">If</a>  we could amend it to actually have them move their night to Wednesday night and have it here in council chambers.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5142.105s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5142.506s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5143.807s">As</a>  amended by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5145.148s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5146.129s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5147.83s">I</a>  second the paper, second approval for the motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5150.673s">Um,</a>  I've received complaints myself and as we come in on a Tuesday night at the <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5156.261s">during</a>  the once a month when the Zoning Board of Appeals meets, we see a crowd outside the hallway and I have received complaints about people that weren't able to speak, they weren't able to hear, and I think it's extremely important that anybody and everybody be able to hear any meeting that goes on at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5172.99s">But</a>  time after time, month after month, that is the one board that meets where the doors are overflowing because you have attorneys, you have residents, you have business owners, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5182.92s">People</a>  from the city council do want to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5185.501s">We're</a>  not able to. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5186.681s">So</a>  I agree with moving it to another night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5189.202s">I</a>  also agree that here would be the right place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5191.842s">I</a>  would ask that we amend this and request that the meetings be televised as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5196.744s">I</a>  think we need to start moving more and more towards televised board and commission meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5201.945s">And</a>  that is one of the biggest and most important boards we have in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5205.726s">And</a>  it's something that I would definitely want to attend more often or at least be able to have that opportunity to watch from home. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5212.75s">We</a>  as city councilors are being asked to get involved with certain projects and ask for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5219.073s">Neighbors</a>  are asking us for help. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5220.333s">So</a>  it's important that we have that opportunity to not only watch the meetings, attend the meetings, speak at the meetings, but everybody should be able to attend the meetings and be able to hear and speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5229.977s">So</a>  I think it's a great resolve and I think it's definitely a positive and I move approval or second the approval of Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5237.66s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5238.741s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5240.055s">Mr.</a>  President, I, too, feel as though the room is too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5242.917s">I</a>  really don't see any problem with having the meetings at a room that has a capacity of no less than 100 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5249.341s">It</a>  doesn't necessarily have to be the Alden Chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5251.743s">We</a>  had a great presentation here by Barbara Kerr a couple of weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5254.285s">Hopefully,</a>  if we get a library grant, we're going to have a great library community space in the library. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5258.608s">We</a>  have the South Metro Fire Station as a community space, so there are other <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5262.83s">available</a>  locales that these meetings can be held. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5265.851s">If</a>  they want to use the Alden Chambers, that's all well and good too, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5268.731s">But</a>  I do think that the room is too small. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5270.631s">I</a>  do think that they can take affirmative steps to address the problem right now, especially in light of the small number of contentious developments that have been before the Zoning Board of Appeals in recent months, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5282.934s">So</a>  I support the resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5284.594s">However,</a>  I feel as though putting it in the Alden Chambers isn't necessarily the end all, be all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5288.675s">There</a>  are other opportunities available. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5290.706s">And</a>  my question as to whether or not if we're going to send a message to the Zoning Board of Appeals that they need to have a meeting, and the meeting has to be accessible to people, that we're dictating where it has to be as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5300.374s">I</a>  think that if we can look at the number of seats that are available in the room, I think that that might be able to be something that's helpful in controlling the situation as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5308.18s">However,</a>  in terms of the resolutions before the body this evening, I have no problem supporting it as authored.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5314.004s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Inouye. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5315.385s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5316.186s">Mr.</a>  President, I agree with everything that's been presented, and I'm grateful <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5320.74s">Councilor</a>  Falco for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5324.481s">While</a>  this certainly has been discussed before on some level, however, I have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5334.163s">I</a>  won't say a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5335.264s">I</a>  have a suggestion to remedy the language, and that is to add the note of suggestion, because I won't support this, Councilor, Mr. President, because on the grounds that that is a semi <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5350.341s">judicial</a>  body. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5352.022s">It</a>  is to be independent from undue political influence, and I won't be a party to that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5359.123s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5360.584s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5362.484s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Falco for offering this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5368.206s">You</a>  know, I think this does apply across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5371.187s">I</a>  know comments were made. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5373.127s">It's</a>  not just the Zoning Board or Community Development Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5377.068s">It's</a>  every board and commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5378.869s">And</a>  I might add, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5379.861s">including</a>  this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5381.364s">There's</a>  been a number of meetings we've had in our council room in 2007. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5384.914s">where</a>  there was an overflow in the hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5387.236s">And</a>  I didn't hear an outcry about the members of the council saying, make sure everyone's in here for transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5394.001s">So</a>  I think we have to be very careful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5397.143s">And</a>  I've been to these community development boards and the zoning boards. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5400.966s">And</a>  in these meetings, they look at site plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5404.549s">They</a>  look at schematics. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5406.41s">And</a>  this is a tough setup to do in that type of format. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5410.473s">And</a>  that's why they have a lengthy table in front of them and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5414.675s">So</a>  I think what we can do is make a recommendation as a council that with any board and commission, including this council, if there is overflow, that they move into a larger capacity area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5425.919s">And</a>  I think that covers everything, rather than saying you have to move here, you have to do this or do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5431.282s">I</a>  think that covers everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5432.442s">So</a>  if there's an overflow, Mr. President, I think common sense should prevail that you move into a room where everyone can participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5440.065s">That's</a>  what Councilor Falco is getting at. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5441.787s">This</a>  is a participating resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5445.129s">It</a>  is open and transparent, and I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5450.494s">But</a>  I'm not sure we solve all that by just having people come into this chamber, because they may have meetings with just a few people, and it'd be a difficult place to sit down with a few people, because it's not set up for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5464.943s">That</a>  would be my recommendation, Mr. President, if an overflow takes place, that a suitable room be found by any board commission or Medford City Council.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5475.468s">As</a>  amended by Councilor, Vice President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5479.57s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5480.69s">Mr.</a>  President, I thank Councilor Marks for bringing up the issue of the fact that there are many boards and commissions in this community and if we're going to be requesting a policy change, that the policy change should be across the board and should not be singling out one board or one commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5494.141s">I</a>  certainly also appreciate Councilor Dello Russo's position that where we have quasi-judicial and quasi-independent boards here in the community that we do need to watch the way we speak in terms of making requests of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5508.064s">A</a>  suggestion or a request, I think, rather than a demand would be something that would be a little bit more beneficial. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5513.565s">As</a>  such, I want to thank both of my colleagues on the council for sharing their insight and input because it certainly had an effect on the way I'll be supporting this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5520.526s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5521.939s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5522.819s">And</a>  I want to thank everyone for their amendments and their concerns and for supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5529.942s">But</a>  I also wanted to mention as well, because we talked about other boards and commissions and the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5534.563s">And</a>  just to mention that I'm in the process of trying, and I know I've talked to you about this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5542.637s">in</a>  the process of trying to schedule the legislative software vendor to come in and basically take a look at what we do with regard to transparency and whatnot with regards to boards and commissions because in addition to putting everything online, which actually helps out with transparency, they can also install cameras in the council meeting room as well, which would help out with other boards and commissions because you could film all these meetings and they could all be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5572.152s">live</a>  and on the cable channel as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5573.853s">So</a>  that there is something that I'm working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5576.736s">I</a>  think you all make great points with regard to those commissions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5581.039s">And</a>  the minutes, the agendas for those other commissions would all be in line as well using the software. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5586.784s">So</a>  I'm hoping to have a vendor come in soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5589.826s">I'm</a>  working on scheduling that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5591.928s">That</a>  actually is from a resolution that everyone supported last year as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5596.892s">So</a>  I just wanted to give you an update with that since we're on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5601.135s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5602.463s">Councilor</a>  Nice.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5603.384s">I</a>  do think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that beginning with the new administration, this council made a request that the majority of board and commission meetings be held off hours during a period of time where individuals in the community can meet to come and attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5618.676s">We</a>  were in a situation where a lot of our meetings were happening at 12, 1, and 2 o'clock in the afternoon during the week, where members of the general public weren't able to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5625.942s">And</a>  the administration did take some affirmative steps to address some of those situations, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5631.937s">Heeding</a>  our advice in that regard, and I think that if we Proceed cautiously and make the request appropriately. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5638.746s">I</a>  feel as though the administration will be willing to listen.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5642.13s">Thank</a>  you councillor On the motion by councillor Falco seconded by councillor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5647.016s">I'm</a>  occurring name and address of the record real quick</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5650.985s">Hi,</a>  Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5652.006s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5654.287s">I'm</a>  glad that we're finally talking about perhaps moving the Board of Appeals meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5657.949s">Because</a>  this council has such a heavy burden of maintaining our zoning ordinances, it's really important that you're able to attend these meetings at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5666.354s">So</a>  a Wednesday meeting, or perhaps let the board choose a day that works for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5671.497s">The</a>  next meeting that will have a large crowd will be the Salem Street Development meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5676.579s">That</a>  is already being held on a Wednesday, on March 8. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5679.693s">Perhaps</a>  it would be a wonderful time to test out this room, because anyone who's attended any of these ZBA meetings knows that a developer presentation runs in excess of an hour, where they show you pictures of everything from shrubs to fitness equipment to present their entire project from the ground up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5698.651s">And</a>  that room is very small. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5701.153s">Saying</a>  that 20 people fit in it is <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5703.706s">is</a>  an exaggeration. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5704.666s">It</a>  really doesn't fit that many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5706.567s">So</a>  I'd like to see, since this is probably one of the most important boards in the city as far as shaping the city, these meetings be brought out into the public, be televised, or at least be in a room that's large enough for all of us to know, and perhaps if we can get those agendas online so that people know that these meetings are coming up, because this is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5726.852s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5728.072s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5730.143s">Roll</a>  call vote has been requested.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5883.384s">Because</a>  Councilor Falco has only asked for the Board of Appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5888.725s">That's</a>  the only meaning he's requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5891.386s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5891.926s">If</a>  somebody wants to amend it for all, all boards and commissions, then you'd have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5898.927s">We</a>  only have one room here, so everybody can't come in this room. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5905.151s">Let's</a>  say if you want to make it for all boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5907.853s">We're</a>  looking for transparency, why would we limit it to one board? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5911.896s">So</a>  if somebody wants to make an amendment to all boards and commissions.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5918.902s">I</a>  think that's the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5920.323s">No</a>  one else feels that way? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5921.784s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5921.964s">It</a>  constantly locks them out of the center.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5924.506s">Does</a>  somebody want to make that amendment?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5926.168s">I</a>  think you'd compromise if you do a board of appeals and all of those types.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5931.171s">You</a>  could just say an amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5934.365s">Just</a>  compromise.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5935.385s">I</a>  just suggest that we compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5937.446s">You</a>  leave the Board of Appeals language in and then also add and any and all other boards.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5944.708s">Any</a>  other city boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5946.108s">All</a>  right, you got that Mr. Clerk?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5948.669s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5948.749s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5948.829s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you could please. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5950.249s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, if you could call the roll please.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5969.645s">I'm</a>  only, uh, I'm only using the, uh, amendment to, uh, to include all city boards and commissions, including these zoning appeals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5980.935s">I'm</a>  not changing the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5982.176s">It's</a>  just an amendment to it, to include it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5984.618s">Uh,</a>  then I think you all should get together and rewrite the whole language because it's just the first sentence because you already got the, you already got the, <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5995.117s">Whereas</a>  the board of appeals, you're amended to rewrite the language. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=5998.899s">So</a>  rewrite the whole thing.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6005.902s">All</a>  boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6008.563s">All</a>  boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6012.245s">Get</a>  that Mr. Clark?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6013.125s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6016.167s">You</a>  got that Mr. Clark? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6016.767s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6018.508s">Councilor</a>  Falco has requested a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6022.369s">Mr.</a>  Clark, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6024.497s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6025.437s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-PNN_I18g2E&t=6026.478s">Councilor</a>  Falco?</p>
