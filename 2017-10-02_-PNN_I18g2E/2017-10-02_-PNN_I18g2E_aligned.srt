17
00:00:27,187 --> 00:00:28,568
Please rise and salute the flag.

18
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:32,911
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,720
with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:42,842
Motion by Councilor Falco.

21
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:47,706
Do we suspend the rules to take a paper out of order?

22
00:00:47,726 --> 00:00:49,687
Thank you, Mr. President.

23
00:00:49,747 --> 00:00:53,870
We can suspend the rules to take 16-574 out of order.

24
00:00:54,171 --> 00:01:00,095
Tonight the Committee of the Whole met regarding the University Accountability Act.

25
00:01:00,195 --> 00:01:07,281
We had discussed it last week on the council floor and it got moved to subcommittee and we discussed it tonight and there are a number of

26
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,321
Amendments to the report.

27
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:27,728
And of the amendments, we have that the administration provide assistance for code enforcement when we receive the report back from Tufts University, that Tufts looks into landlords registering with Tufts University.

28
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:34,171
Notifications be sent from the building commissioner to all realtors in Medford.

29
00:01:35,415 --> 00:01:48,577
And the last amendment was that the zoning ordinance go out with the next tax bill so that everyone in the community is aware of the ordinance change with regard to the University Accountability Act.

30
00:01:48,957 --> 00:01:57,339
So at this point, I'd like to make a motion that the committee report be adopted as amended and the ordinance take its first reading.

31
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:58,459
You have a second?

32
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,299
Seconded.

33
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:00,379
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

34
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:00,899
Mr. Clerk.

35
00:02:00,919 --> 00:02:02,940
Mr. President, just if I could.

36
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:05,087
Councilor Marks.

37
00:02:05,888 --> 00:02:23,317
I think the, uh, the last amendment that was offered was that, um, a copy of the current, uh, city occupancy ordinance go out within the tax bill itself, not a copy of the ordinance that we're working on now.

38
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:25,739
I just want the record to reflect that.

39
00:02:25,899 --> 00:02:26,159
Thank you.

40
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:27,657
Councilor Lococoon.

41
00:02:27,817 --> 00:02:29,218
Thank you, President Carviello.

42
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:40,702
And I think it was also offered that the Tufts University report back to us within 30 to 45 days and the requests we've made from them, even if they don't have a direct response to each and every one that we get an update.

43
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:41,843
Thank you.

44
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:43,923
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

45
00:02:47,385 --> 00:02:48,265
Councilor DelaRusso.

46
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:48,825
Yes.

47
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:50,206
Councilor Falco.

48
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:50,506
Yes.

49
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:51,706
Councilor Knight.

50
00:02:51,967 --> 00:02:52,187
Yes.

51
00:02:52,827 --> 00:02:53,687
Councilor Lococoon.

52
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:53,847
Yes.

53
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:55,028
Vice President Mox.

54
00:02:55,328 --> 00:02:55,508
Yes.

55
00:02:56,155 --> 00:02:56,935
Councilor Scott Pelli?

56
00:02:57,155 --> 00:02:57,396
Yes.

57
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,956
President Caviello?

58
00:02:59,036 --> 00:02:59,277
Yes.

59
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:01,758
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

60
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:02,598
Motion passes.

61
00:03:04,279 --> 00:03:07,901
While we're under suspension, we will take 17-065.

62
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:14,104
And the chairman of licensing is Councilor Scott Pelli.

63
00:03:17,145 --> 00:03:18,126
Thank you, Mr. President.

64
00:03:19,927 --> 00:03:23,809
I have a petition for pictures licensed by

65
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,421
Khalida Parveen, are they here?

66
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,801
Okay.

67
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:32,602
412.5 Granite Ave, Milton, Mass.

68
00:03:33,242 --> 00:03:36,983
This is for Zam Zam's Restaurant, 42 Riverside Ave, Medford.

69
00:03:37,563 --> 00:03:37,863
Yes, sir.

70
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:47,705
If you can just give us a little brief description of your restaurant, so this council knows.

71
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:53,206
Yeah, it's gonna be Indian Pakistani food at 42 Riverside Avenue.

72
00:03:54,293 --> 00:03:57,415
And we already have one in East Boston.

73
00:03:57,595 --> 00:04:01,057
We're running since 80 of that one.

74
00:04:02,017 --> 00:04:03,598
And we're opening the new one.

75
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,399
Okay, so I find everything is in order, Mr. President.

76
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:13,483
So one question I did have is, hours of operations, what time are you open, what time are you closing?

77
00:04:13,903 --> 00:04:15,724
11 to 10.30.

78
00:04:16,465 --> 00:04:15,724
10.30?

79
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:16,845
Okay.

80
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,447
So you're familiar with meth or anything after 11 that you have to ask for a special permit?

81
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:21,267
Oh, no, not at all, yeah.

82
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:22,428
Okay.

83
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:24,818
All right, thank you, sir.

84
00:04:25,438 --> 00:04:31,920
Mr. President, I find all the paperwork in order, so I move to accept and place approval.

85
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:33,041
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

86
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:33,581
Thank you.

87
00:04:34,522 --> 00:04:35,642
Counselor Del Rosso.

88
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:42,705
If I could, through the chair, Mr. President, and ask the proprietor, how many varieties of naan will your restaurant offer?

89
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,185
About four or five.

90
00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:45,606
Thank you very much.

91
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,207
Second, Mr. President.

92
00:04:47,568 --> 00:04:48,929
Second by Councilor DelaRusso.

93
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:49,730
Councilor Knight.

94
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,355
Mr. President, I'd like to also point out that this restaurant will be filling a vacant storefront at 42 Riverside Avenue.

95
00:04:57,456 --> 00:04:59,558
Paperwork looks in order, as Councilor Scott Pelli said.

96
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:02,281
I go along with his recommendation, move for approval, Mr. President.

97
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:05,543
On the motion of Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

98
00:05:05,984 --> 00:05:06,684
All those in favor?

99
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:07,125
Aye.

100
00:05:07,625 --> 00:05:08,326
Motion passes.

101
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:09,227
Congratulations, sir.

102
00:05:13,675 --> 00:05:14,956
He's gone quick.

103
00:05:15,216 --> 00:05:25,639
While we're under suspension, 17-067, communications from the mayor.

104
00:05:25,679 --> 00:05:34,341
I'm sorry, 17-066, communications from the mayor to Honorable Presidents, members of city council, city hall of Medford, dear Mr. President and city councilors.

105
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:40,185
I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following transfer.

106
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:48,531
$50,000 to be transferred from highway materials and supplies to ordinary account 010-422-5530-1539 to personal account number 010-421-5130-1104, highway overtime.

107
00:06:04,315 --> 00:06:10,498
This transfer is needed as the city performed catch-basin work rather than contracting it out.

108
00:06:11,098 --> 00:06:16,780
Finance Director Alicia Nunley is present to answer any of the council's questions regarding this matter.

109
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:19,462
Name and address for the record, please.

110
00:06:20,182 --> 00:06:22,683
Yes, Alicia Nunley, Finance Director, City of Medford.

111
00:06:24,644 --> 00:06:25,384
Councilor Lococo.

112
00:06:26,465 --> 00:06:27,465
I'm sorry, Councilor Scott-Bell.

113
00:06:27,878 --> 00:06:28,419
Oh, thank you.

114
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:29,700
Thank you very much.

115
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,021
Just a quick question.

116
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:35,025
I know that we've been talking about replacing and fixing the catch bases.

117
00:06:35,085 --> 00:06:38,528
Do you know how many we're looking to fix on our own?

118
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:41,491
The DPW director may be able to answer that.

119
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:42,192
Do you know how many?

120
00:06:48,392 --> 00:06:49,393
Name and address of the record, sir.

121
00:06:50,093 --> 00:06:53,375
My name is Brian Cameron's, the commissioner of public works for the city of Medford.

122
00:06:53,935 --> 00:06:57,477
Uh, to answer the question to counselor, the initial list that we had was 32.

123
00:06:58,678 --> 00:06:59,598
We've exceeded that.

124
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:00,179
We're now up to 38.

125
00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:00,839
All right.

126
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:08,143
And this particular transfer would be for, uh, you know, uh, man hours as well as material.

127
00:07:08,685 --> 00:07:11,227
are to carry us through to the end of the fiscal year.

128
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:13,489
Are we hoping to do all 38?

129
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,191
Excuse me, what's that?

130
00:07:15,211 --> 00:07:16,873
Are we looking to complete all 38?

131
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,235
Okay, no, that's what we've completed.

132
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:19,895
Oh, we have?

133
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:20,176
Yes.

134
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:25,380
Yeah, the initial list, okay, that I proposed initially when this program began was 32.

135
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:25,821
Really?

136
00:07:25,921 --> 00:07:27,562
We've now completed 38.

137
00:07:28,837 --> 00:07:29,077
also.

138
00:07:29,177 --> 00:07:29,438
Okay.

139
00:07:29,618 --> 00:07:29,878
City.

140
00:07:29,898 --> 00:07:30,378
All right.

141
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:35,463
And of course, with the weather being how it is with the warm and cold, the floor and everything.

142
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:35,883
Okay.

143
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:37,144
It's work in progress.

144
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:38,706
And you know, there's plenty more to do.

145
00:07:38,726 --> 00:07:39,346
All right.

146
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:40,187
Thank you.

147
00:07:40,207 --> 00:07:40,647
Okay.

148
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:43,570
Councilor Falco.

149
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,831
Thank you, Mr President.

150
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:47,193
If I may ask Mr Cairns a quick question.

151
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:58,471
So the work was, did you say the work was done in house by city employees?

152
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:00,511
Yes, it was DPW highway division.

153
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:00,851
Great.

154
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:01,292
Perfect.

155
00:08:01,492 --> 00:08:03,392
I like to see what we do work inside.

156
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:10,794
Um, so as far as, uh, so how much did we save actually by keeping it in house and doing it with our own employees as to contracting it out?

157
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:13,174
Uh, I don't have that figure readily available.

158
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:16,955
I can gladly supply a counselor, but it was a significant, significant amount.

159
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:17,756
That's what I'm thinking.

160
00:08:17,776 --> 00:08:23,197
I mean, it's, it's, uh, I know, um, you know, we have some talented people here that can do a lot of work of, you know,

161
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,551
Very talented.

162
00:08:24,731 --> 00:08:31,875
It would be great if we had more people, but it would be interesting to see how much of a savings this would represent by doing it in-house.

163
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:32,876
So I'm glad we did it.

164
00:08:33,576 --> 00:08:36,618
And I'm sorry, did you say how many more we have to do, or how many more we need to do?

165
00:08:36,638 --> 00:08:38,119
OK, it's a work in progress, Councilor.

166
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:45,264
With this weather here, they keep cropping up, but we're starting to get ahead of it now from the initial list.

167
00:08:45,544 --> 00:08:45,904
OK, great.

168
00:08:46,405 --> 00:08:46,785
Thank you.

169
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:49,487
Councilor Neistat.

170
00:08:50,986 --> 00:08:52,527
Mr. President, move approval of the paper.

171
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:59,569
I think that the DPW director has shown that doing this work in-house is going to be a cost savings for the city of Medford.

172
00:08:59,629 --> 00:09:06,171
It also shows that his expectations were exceeded when he initially came to this council seeking funding back in the spring.

173
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:09,612
They were looking for some funds to fix 32 catch basins.

174
00:09:09,652 --> 00:09:12,793
They fixed 32 and six more, and they continue to do the work.

175
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,213
I feel as though this is a good appropriation.

176
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:24,667
Coupled with the fact that the work is being performed in-house, Mr. President, I believe that we maintain control and direction of the employees and also the ability to get them out there faster and fix any mistakes that may or may not occur.

177
00:09:25,507 --> 00:09:31,010
Personally, I feel as though the work that's done in-house is a far better product than what's done through subcontracted labor.

178
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:33,672
And for those reasons, I support this paper wholeheartedly and move approval.

179
00:09:37,092 --> 00:09:45,779
Mr. President, I want to express my gratitude to Commissioner Perrins and the members of the Department of Public Works for their good work in this matter.

180
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:50,982
It's been, there have been a number that we've reported over the past several years.

181
00:09:51,443 --> 00:09:53,544
We're glad to see great progress.

182
00:09:54,305 --> 00:09:56,547
The Commissioner knows how to get things done.

183
00:09:56,927 --> 00:09:57,567
We're grateful.

184
00:09:57,968 --> 00:09:59,409
Second approval, Mr. President.

185
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:01,771
Seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

186
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:03,132
Vice President Marks.

187
00:10:03,992 --> 00:10:04,913
Thank you, Mr. President.

188
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:09,301
If I could, maybe Alicia can shed some light on this.

189
00:10:10,061 --> 00:10:13,584
It said $50,000 was transferred from the highway materials and supplies.

190
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:18,667
That account, what was the initial appropriation in this year's budget?

191
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:21,549
I don't know the initial appropriation.

192
00:10:21,569 --> 00:10:32,837
I know that you guys voted on a, to the President, excuse me, $100,000 in free cash to that account, and we needed to move $50,000 of that free cash you appropriated into the salary count since it's in-house and not contracted out.

193
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:34,940
Okay.

194
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:42,626
So, so the, the account that you're saying this is 0 1 0 count 4 4 2 4 2 2 highway materials.

195
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,768
What, what is that currently used for?

196
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:48,971
What, what, what do we get with highway materials?

197
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:52,234
I think the DPW commission means that.

198
00:10:56,397 --> 00:11:02,882
Councilor that's a useful miscellaneous supplies, uh, particularly for the highway division for day to day operation.

199
00:11:03,853 --> 00:11:06,214
while we're on the subject here of catch basins.

200
00:11:06,234 --> 00:11:12,518
It could be for frames, covers, cement, barrel block, asphalt.

201
00:11:12,538 --> 00:11:15,019
It could be used for a whole host of reasons.

202
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:16,960
Right.

203
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:23,823
So by taking it out of that account and putting it into an overtime account, are we depleting that one account?

204
00:11:24,003 --> 00:11:27,725
Are we running the red in that account right now?

205
00:11:29,086 --> 00:11:29,526
No, no.

206
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:32,768
What happened was when we did the original free cash appropriation

207
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:35,949
We put $100,000 into this account.

208
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:40,070
We should have actually split it $50,000, $50,000 between personal and ordinary.

209
00:11:41,051 --> 00:11:44,612
All $100,000 of the free cash appropriation is in that one ordinary account.

210
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:48,933
And in order for him to pay in-house employees, it has to be put into a personal account.

211
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:52,875
So why wasn't it put in the personal account immediately?

212
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,295
That was just overlooked.

213
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:55,295
That's why we're coming back.

214
00:11:55,576 --> 00:11:56,016
That was what?

215
00:11:56,176 --> 00:11:56,956
It was overlooked.

216
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:58,176
It was overlooked?

217
00:11:58,237 --> 00:11:58,677
Yeah.

218
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:02,438
They may have thought they were going to contract and said they start savings and did it in-house.

219
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:03,572
instead of going out.

220
00:12:03,912 --> 00:12:06,333
If they had contracted, it would have been fine in the account that they had it in.

221
00:12:06,993 --> 00:12:10,115
So is it fair to say there's $50,000 left in that account?

222
00:12:12,355 --> 00:12:17,077
There's $50,000 of the salaries in that account that they can't use to pay the guys.

223
00:12:18,218 --> 00:12:18,378
Right.

224
00:12:18,398 --> 00:12:20,698
So what's currently left after you pull the $50,000 out?

225
00:12:21,019 --> 00:12:23,399
I can get back to you on that and tell you what their balance is.

226
00:12:23,419 --> 00:12:24,680
I didn't bring that information with me.

227
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:26,821
OK.

228
00:12:27,201 --> 00:12:29,102
And Commissioner Kerins,

229
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:35,355
Do you have an active working list of what catch basins need to be done in the community?

230
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:47,092
I can give you the completed list, and then whatever we've seen out there or has been reported to us, I do have a list that I can provide you.

231
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,171
But I didn't bring it with me.

232
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:50,671
I'm not interested in the completed list.

233
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:54,893
I'd like to see a list of catch basins that you have record of that need attention.

234
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:55,353
Sure.

235
00:12:55,613 --> 00:12:55,693
OK.

236
00:12:55,874 --> 00:12:57,794
No, I can gladly supply that to you.

237
00:12:57,834 --> 00:13:00,355
But it's work, again, work in progress.

238
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:07,098
So whatever I may give you today or tomorrow may change two days from now, depending on what we come upon and what's reported.

239
00:13:07,338 --> 00:13:07,518
Right.

240
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:11,080
Do you know roughly how many are on that list that need to be attended to?

241
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,941
I think right now I'd say at least 12.

242
00:13:14,307 --> 00:13:18,748
All right, that we have out there that, in our opinion, have to be rebuilt.

243
00:13:19,928 --> 00:13:20,728
Totally rebuilt.

244
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:22,429
Yeah, completely rebuilt.

245
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,409
I mean, just how far down we have to go.

246
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:30,950
We have to actually take off the cover and get down and inspect them, each one on a case-by-case basis.

247
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,891
Some of them are total rebuilds, which means going 10 feet down, working your way up.

248
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:38,492
Some could be only the top four feet.

249
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:40,332
They all vary in condition.

250
00:13:40,992 --> 00:13:41,132
Right.

251
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,500
Yeah.

252
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:49,049
If you can provide the council with a list of currently what needs to be done, um, because, because the number sounds awfully low to me.

253
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:56,058
And I realized you just said 12 need to be rebuilt, but in just going around the city, I see a lot of sunken catch basins.

254
00:13:57,689 --> 00:13:59,010
A lot of them.

255
00:13:59,050 --> 00:13:59,590
Yeah, there are.

256
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,290
Like I said, it's work in progress, Councillor.

257
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:01,730
Right.

258
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,010
OK, that we're doing.

259
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,631
But I mean, we've made excellent headway.

260
00:14:04,871 --> 00:14:13,433
Of course, this time of the year with the cold and everything, there are some days it's the weather permitting as far as actually working on, particularly when you're dealing with asphalt and cement.

261
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:24,075
But when we take advantage of a good day, we go out there and the crew can rebuild an average of three a day, again, depending on their condition when they start.

262
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:31,280
And while we're talking about catch basins, we still currently contract out for the cleaning of the catch basins, correct?

263
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,220
That's correct, sir.

264
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:34,342
And where do we stand with that currently?

265
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:37,885
Right now, we've obviously ceased for the winter.

266
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:43,491
We'll pick the program back up in April and continue on with it.

267
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:53,810
But are we a certain percentage through our list, or you said, I'm sure when the budget comes out in July, we start working on catch basin cleaning, right?

268
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,630
That's correct.

269
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:57,772
So how far do we get into the catch basin cleaning before the winter came?

270
00:14:58,252 --> 00:14:59,113
Okay.

271
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:04,075
Right now, I would have to say we're probably about 85 to 90% completed.

272
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:04,576
Okay.

273
00:15:04,596 --> 00:15:05,056
All right.

274
00:15:05,076 --> 00:15:08,758
It's just now a question of our finishing up, you know, before, you know, the weather turned on us.

275
00:15:09,985 --> 00:15:12,526
And it's all being done by the subcontractor?

276
00:15:12,546 --> 00:15:13,287
That's correct, sir.

277
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:20,550
And at any given year, do they get through 100% of the catch basins, or do we just subcontract for a certain percentage of what we have?

278
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:30,614
No, OK, from what I've gathered past history, they have been able to complete the portion in the summertime, fall.

279
00:15:31,074 --> 00:15:32,615
And then they pick up back in the spring.

280
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:37,358
But they've pretty much stayed on top of cleaning all the basins in the city.

281
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:41,400
So every year, we're getting through 100% of the catch basin cleanings?

282
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:43,662
Very close to it, if not 100%.

283
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:47,304
Again, it's only my first year here.

284
00:15:47,344 --> 00:15:50,666
My target is to get 100% by June 30.

285
00:15:51,687 --> 00:15:51,887
OK.

286
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:57,610
And is the process still that this company will mark each catch basin?

287
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:02,026
different color when they are completed?

288
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,487
That's yes, it is.

289
00:16:03,527 --> 00:16:04,649
That's correct, vice president.

290
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:06,531
So so they'll use some type of marking.

291
00:16:06,851 --> 00:16:08,653
Yes, they're okay if they spray painted.

292
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:14,379
Can you provide us with a report on the number of catch basins that have been done this fiscal year?

293
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,723
Okay, I can provide you the list of streets.

294
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:22,333
Okay, each street varies as far as the number of bases on each street.

295
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:28,295
I don't need to know the exact number, but if you could tell us how many streets altogether and how many have been completed, that'd be great to date.

296
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:28,655
Certainly.

297
00:16:28,915 --> 00:16:29,255
Thank you.

298
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:29,515
Okay.

299
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:31,836
Councilor DelaRusso.

300
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:39,998
I just want to express my gratitude to Alicia Nunley for her explanation and transparency of these accounts.

301
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:42,139
Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

302
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:46,560
On the motion by Councilor Naith, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso,

303
00:16:47,748 --> 00:16:48,509
All those in favor?

304
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:50,350
Aye.

305
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:51,891
Roll call vote is required.

306
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:53,912
Councilor Del Rosso?

307
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:54,293
Yes.

308
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:55,553
Councilor Fevella?

309
00:16:55,593 --> 00:16:55,774
Yes.

310
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:56,734
Councilor Night?

311
00:16:56,794 --> 00:16:57,495
Yes.

312
00:16:57,515 --> 00:16:58,295
Councilor Kern?

313
00:16:58,335 --> 00:16:58,495
Yes.

314
00:16:58,856 --> 00:16:59,656
Vice President Marks?

315
00:16:59,796 --> 00:17:00,016
Yes.

316
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:01,377
Councilor Scott Pele?

317
00:17:01,638 --> 00:17:01,858
Yes.

318
00:17:02,058 --> 00:17:02,818
President Caprio?

319
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:04,039
Yes.

320
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:07,161
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

321
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:07,722
The money is in.

322
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:11,084
We have one more.

323
00:17:11,304 --> 00:17:13,666
One more, 17-067.

324
00:17:14,386 --> 00:17:16,728
To the Honorable President, members of the Memphis City Council,

325
00:17:17,212 --> 00:17:17,973
City Hall, Medford.

326
00:17:18,813 --> 00:17:36,468

327
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:42,293
$33,000, equipment needed to support a critical response team within the Medford Police Department.

328
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:44,455
Funding will support FAV

329
00:17:45,717 --> 00:17:53,919
advanced webless system vests, 16 of them, and related guards for body protection.

330
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:59,780
$25,000, speed monitors.

331
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,861
$400,000, purchase of 12 police cruises, six marked, six unmarked.

332
00:18:04,881 --> 00:18:14,823
$40,000, forestry department for an F-250 pickup truck with a three-quarter ton with a plow package.

333
00:18:16,538 --> 00:18:22,101
34,000 OCE scanner copier for the engineering departments.

334
00:18:22,121 --> 00:18:24,623
100,000 for a cemetery backhoe.

335
00:18:24,643 --> 00:18:29,726
28,000 for an F-150 four wheel drive truck with a 100 gallon fuel tank.

336
00:18:29,746 --> 00:18:34,569
45,000 for an F-350 SRW four wheel drive truck with a body lift gate.

337
00:18:46,422 --> 00:18:52,125
$40,000 for a Ford Explorer for the highway commissioner.

338
00:18:52,145 --> 00:19:00,089
$60,000 for a fire department computer system upgrade with email.

339
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:10,475
And $300,000 for the fire department second set of turnout gear, accelerated from the fiscal year 2018 budget.

340
00:19:11,835 --> 00:19:15,137
The balance in certified cash prior to this vote is $9 million.

341
00:19:17,195 --> 00:19:27,081
$709,329.

342
00:19:19,196 --> 00:19:27,081
With the exception of the police items, the remaining were presented in the draft capital budget presented in the fall.

343
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:38,307
Chief of police, Leo Sacco, deputy fire chief, and DPW commissioner, Brian Kearns will be present to answer any questions we may have.

344
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:40,369
Councilor Falco.

345
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:42,030
Thank you, Mr. President.

346
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:42,430
Um,

347
00:19:43,123 --> 00:19:44,443
I just have a question in general.

348
00:19:44,623 --> 00:19:48,085
Um, you know, of course safety and the wellbeing of personnel is always a top priority.

349
00:19:48,585 --> 00:20:01,269
So with regard to, um, the turndown gear, um, so if this gets approved, when can we actually see, you know, the, the turndown gear, the, the police cars, the, uh, uh, the new trucks.

350
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:05,750
I mean, when, when, when will, when we, when will, when will we actually see this?

351
00:20:07,531 --> 00:20:07,631
Um,

352
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,281
I would think the mayor was looking to do this as soon as possible.

353
00:20:11,721 --> 00:20:18,664
So if we approve this tonight, is the turn down gear gonna be, you know, I'm sorry, turn out gear, I apologize.

354
00:20:19,444 --> 00:20:21,165
Yeah, so as soon as possible, it will be done.

355
00:20:22,185 --> 00:20:23,786
Point of information, Councilor Scott Pelley.

356
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:26,407
Let me ask the Deputy Chief, were they already ordered?

357
00:20:27,087 --> 00:20:33,710
Would they know, who would know that, if the turn out gear, because I thought they were already ordered, because I think that took some time.

358
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:36,891
Name and address of the record, please.

359
00:20:38,048 --> 00:20:39,149
Point of order, Councilor Knight.

360
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:46,336
Would it make sense for each individual that's representing a respective department to come up and do a brief presentation on the appropriation that's being requested right now?

361
00:20:46,356 --> 00:20:49,339
We have Chief Sacco, we have Deputy Chief here as well.

362
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,701
Name and address of the record.

363
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:53,123
Matt McConough, Deputy Chief, Meffitt Fire Department.

364
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:54,404
What was the question, Councilor?

365
00:20:54,444 --> 00:20:56,046
The question, the turnout gear.

366
00:20:56,502 --> 00:20:57,482
Have they already been ordered?

367
00:20:57,642 --> 00:20:58,102
No.

368
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:01,403
In fact, we just got our first couple of bids for this.

369
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:07,324
So once we award it, then it would probably take about a month probably to have everybody fitted and then to get it be made.

370
00:21:07,664 --> 00:21:09,665
So I would guess a month.

371
00:21:10,045 --> 00:21:10,305
Thank you.

372
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:11,305
I'm sorry, Mr. Fowler.

373
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:12,326
Thank you.

374
00:21:12,886 --> 00:21:13,246
No problem.

375
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:16,746
Chief Sacco, would you like to speak?

376
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:18,307
Good evening.

377
00:21:18,627 --> 00:21:20,907
Leo Sacco, police chief here in the city of Medford.

378
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:23,588
My home address is 227 Elm Street in Medford.

379
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:29,629
Chief, you have the critical response equipment.

380
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:30,590
Could you tell us what that is?

381
00:21:31,631 --> 00:21:42,361
Okay, that is, I'll explain what the critical incident or critical response team was developed last spring in light of what's going on around the country.

382
00:21:42,822 --> 00:21:46,265
We need to train officers in our department to do a quick deployment.

383
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:54,767
when they're working, if there's an incident, a major incident that might happen anywhere, whether it be at a mall, shopping center, school, et cetera.

384
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:59,791
God forbid it happens, but we have to be prepared and be ready to go.

385
00:22:00,391 --> 00:22:05,834
So we have 16 members of a team, actually I think it's down to 15 right now, that have been trained and outfitted.

386
00:22:06,775 --> 00:22:08,696
This is a key piece of their equipment.

387
00:22:08,736 --> 00:22:12,399
This is a tactical vest that we need to outfit them with.

388
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:15,141
And it is a staggering figure,

389
00:22:16,105 --> 00:22:26,130
We can't get reimbursement from the state or the federal government for this vest, because we already issued the other vest, the regular body armor, the soft body armor, for the individual officers.

390
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:32,273
And the state and the federal government will only reimburse for one set of body armor.

391
00:22:32,773 --> 00:22:34,314
So this is something that's needed.

392
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:35,454
It's over and above.

393
00:22:35,494 --> 00:22:36,595
It's a tactical vest.

394
00:22:37,195 --> 00:22:38,596
They wear it like a jacket.

395
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:39,196
It's heavy.

396
00:22:39,937 --> 00:22:44,939
It takes a lot to hold it up, but it will withstand gunfire.

397
00:22:46,072 --> 00:22:49,253
And the $25,000 for speed monitors, Chief, what kind of?

398
00:22:49,674 --> 00:22:52,335
Members of this council have been asking for this for a long time.

399
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:55,476
We have one that was struck and I think it's beyond repair.

400
00:22:55,516 --> 00:22:57,377
We've had a couple of companies look at it.

401
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:09,181
This will buy two speed monitors so that we can be more effective out in the community as far as radar and speed enforcement and actually let the community see what the speed limit actually is on the street.

402
00:23:09,662 --> 00:23:13,283
Sometimes if you see a 20 mile per hour or a 30 mile per hour,

403
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:14,486
speed.

404
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:18,388
You think they're doing 50 and it's actually the monitor will show what the true speed is.

405
00:23:18,488 --> 00:23:20,368
So we look forward to those.

406
00:23:20,969 --> 00:23:27,571
And I think chief, this is your biggest one here is, um, 12 cruises, six marked and six unmarked.

407
00:23:27,931 --> 00:23:28,812
This is huge.

408
00:23:28,912 --> 00:23:35,154
This is the first time, uh, been chief now going on 27 years.

409
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:42,437
This is the first time that I can say that, uh, that we'd be able to receive 12 brand new vehicles pretty much at one time.

410
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:43,277
Uh,

411
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:45,053
six marked, six unmarked.

412
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:54,980
I know that sometimes there's a little issue with the idea of unmarked vehicles, but some of our unmarked vehicles are close to 20 years old, very high mileage.

413
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:03,666
Some of the old painted over Ford Crown Victorias, they look pretty good, but they're high mileage, they're 200,000 miles on them.

414
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:03,726
So,

415
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,390
We've run out of vehicles.

416
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,991
We're using drug forfeiture cars, which actually are pieces of junk.

417
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:14,831
This is something that we really need.

418
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:20,052
And I'm thankful that the mayor listened to my request and put it forward.

419
00:24:20,492 --> 00:24:25,873
But obviously, this council has been pushing for the marked vehicles right along and getting replacement vehicles.

420
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:29,674
So six will also be a good infusion.

421
00:24:29,694 --> 00:24:34,555
And we'll probably be able to auction off the Crown Victorias that are really high mileage.

422
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:36,635
And it really served us well, but they're at

423
00:24:37,193 --> 00:24:38,053
the end of their life.

424
00:24:39,134 --> 00:24:41,115
What type of vehicles are you planning on buying, Chief?

425
00:24:41,335 --> 00:24:42,195
The Ford Explorer.

426
00:24:42,996 --> 00:24:44,016
What about for the NMAC cars?

427
00:24:44,056 --> 00:24:46,577
The NMACs are probably going to be Ford Fusions.

428
00:24:47,858 --> 00:24:48,398
Thank you, Chief.

429
00:24:48,418 --> 00:24:53,760
I know it's something you've looked for a while, and I would hope you'll support that this evening.

430
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,141
I appreciate that.

431
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:57,762
And just to answer Councilor Falco's question,

432
00:24:58,682 --> 00:25:05,326
I've been told by the Chief Procurement Officer that once this was approved, that they would place the order.

433
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:08,847
I've checked with the company that has the state contract for the vehicles.

434
00:25:09,328 --> 00:25:10,929
They would have to order the vehicles.

435
00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:13,430
Some of the vehicles may be in stock, but they would have to order.

436
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:19,133
So it would be dependent on how long it would take Ford Motor Company to get them off the assembly line.

437
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:23,055
But hopefully, definitely before the beginning of the summer.

438
00:25:24,095 --> 00:25:24,596
Thank you, Chief.

439
00:25:25,176 --> 00:25:26,477
Mr. Cairns, would you like to?

440
00:25:26,697 --> 00:25:26,997
Thank you.

441
00:25:30,088 --> 00:25:31,268
Mr. Kearns make his presentation.

442
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:32,708
Then we'll ask them everyone at the questions, right?

443
00:25:33,828 --> 00:25:34,048
Yeah.

444
00:25:37,089 --> 00:25:39,870
Mr. Kearns, why don't you, this equipment's for you.

445
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,230
So why don't you explain?

446
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:53,053
So this way, I'd like to just ask that we please amend the paper on, um, the $40,000 forestry F two 50 pickup truck with plow package should actually be UHF radio.

447
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:54,313
I'm sorry, which one is it?

448
00:25:55,838 --> 00:25:56,478
For the forestry?

449
00:25:56,618 --> 00:26:02,102
Yes, the forestry F-250 for $40,000 should actually be UHF radio system for the DPW.

450
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:05,003
Mr. Gerens.

451
00:26:05,223 --> 00:26:06,124
Yes, Mr. President.

452
00:26:10,647 --> 00:26:23,974
The Department of Public Works has put in a request for the upgrade of some of the vehicles that are at the point now where they're really getting beyond repair.

453
00:26:25,443 --> 00:26:35,626
You know, a lot of them, again, high mileage and, you know, now are also suffering from deterioration from, you know, body rot from over the years.

454
00:26:36,526 --> 00:26:45,048
Some of these vehicles are on state contract, so it would be just a question of finance department issuing a purchase order.

455
00:26:45,908 --> 00:26:52,570
As far as the estimated time, you know, we're getting, you know, anywhere from, you know, one to three months depending on

456
00:26:53,264 --> 00:26:55,986
you know, what the specifications call for.

457
00:26:56,707 --> 00:27:15,842
As far as what the auditor was explaining as far as the radio communication system, the existing two-way radio communication system was, from what I gather, the history of it, is the original two-way radio system that the Medford Police Department got back

458
00:27:16,497 --> 00:27:18,378
many, many, many, many years ago.

459
00:27:19,639 --> 00:27:22,361
It is getting to the point, it's beyond repair.

460
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,342
Parts are no longer available.

461
00:27:24,362 --> 00:27:25,863
It's an old low band system.

462
00:27:26,703 --> 00:27:36,209
And what's happening now is a lot of guys have been using their cell phones because the radios in the trucks no longer work.

463
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:39,411
The range on them is very, very limited.

464
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:43,093
And it just needs a systems upgrade

465
00:27:44,848 --> 00:28:00,239
not only for getting the work done on a day-to-day basis and to stretch out the man hours rather than go back to the yard and get further instructions, but it's also for the safety of the personnel driving all the equipment that's out there.

466
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:02,360
Okay.

467
00:28:04,882 --> 00:28:05,222
Thank you.

468
00:28:05,342 --> 00:28:05,502
Yep.

469
00:28:08,424 --> 00:28:09,065
All right.

470
00:28:10,286 --> 00:28:10,786
Councilor Falco.

471
00:28:11,767 --> 00:28:12,447
Thank you, Mr. President.

472
00:28:12,467 --> 00:28:14,168
I just had a question for Chief Sacco.

473
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,230
Yes, sir.

474
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,370
Thank you, Chief.

475
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:26,313
So with regard to the new cruisers, the marked and unmarked, so we're buying new cruisers, which is great.

476
00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:26,933
We need them.

477
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:31,795
But as far as the, what should be our strategy for purchasing going forward?

478
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:33,575
Should we be replacing cruisers?

479
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:34,796
I mean, in your opinion, you've been

480
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:36,201
doing this for a while.

481
00:28:36,461 --> 00:28:38,322
What should the city be doing moving forward?

482
00:28:39,423 --> 00:28:41,283
Should we be buying them every year, every few years?

483
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:42,924
What's the best approach?

484
00:28:43,124 --> 00:28:48,426
The best approach is buying vehicles every year, five to six vehicles every year.

485
00:28:48,466 --> 00:28:51,748
That would replace your frontline fleet.

486
00:28:52,328 --> 00:28:57,490
And then you could have a supervisor's vehicle or a canine vehicle or an unmarked vehicle.

487
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,572
With this happening right now, six and six, this gives us a great foundation.

488
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:05,093
But we can't let a year slide by.

489
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:05,959
Exactly.

490
00:29:05,979 --> 00:29:06,959
You have to stay on top of it.

491
00:29:06,999 --> 00:29:08,260
You only need 12 every year.

492
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,781
But if you could replace, you know, five, four might not be just enough.

493
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:15,121
Five would be good.

494
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:16,021
Six would be better.

495
00:29:16,141 --> 00:29:17,182
It would be the best.

496
00:29:17,342 --> 00:29:21,443
Every year, there should be every year or no more than 18 months.

497
00:29:21,823 --> 00:29:22,683
OK, perfect.

498
00:29:22,723 --> 00:29:23,043
Thank you.

499
00:29:24,843 --> 00:29:25,704
Vice President Box.

500
00:29:27,364 --> 00:29:28,304
Thank you, Mr. President.

501
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:35,006
Regarding the speed monitors for twenty five thousand, are we getting one or two chief?

502
00:29:35,046 --> 00:29:35,486
How many speed?

503
00:29:36,097 --> 00:29:36,957
The goal is two.

504
00:29:37,078 --> 00:29:40,519
I believe we can purchase 12,500 for each.

505
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,442
And currently, how many speed monitors do we have within the department?

506
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:46,143
We have one that's inoperable.

507
00:29:47,103 --> 00:29:50,245
Right now, it was struck when it was on the road.

508
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:51,646
So we just have one?

509
00:29:52,426 --> 00:29:54,227
We really don't even have that one now.

510
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:55,208
We need these two.

511
00:29:55,748 --> 00:29:56,528
OK.

512
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:04,773
And the police cruisers and the EMAC vehicles, are they going to be fully equipped with the latest computers?

513
00:30:05,659 --> 00:30:14,726
The, uh, the mock vehicles will be fully equipped with all, all the computers, radios, lighting, uh, the unmarked vehicles won't have computers.

514
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:19,470
Every detective has a, uh, a laptop or a tablet so that they can use.

515
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,672
They don't need them in the, in the vehicle itself.

516
00:30:22,152 --> 00:30:26,716
They will have radios in the vehicle and they'll have emergency lighting and a siren.

517
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:28,978
Okay.

518
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:39,552
And I know within the budget chief, you put in for some additional civilian personnel to do some computer work and also some crime statistics.

519
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:42,992
Is that still something that you could use in the police department?

520
00:30:43,252 --> 00:30:43,452
Yes.

521
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:48,433
Are you going to be making a recommendation for that manpower again or?

522
00:30:48,733 --> 00:30:49,233
Yes, I will.

523
00:30:49,693 --> 00:30:49,914
Okay.

524
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:53,674
Do we expect to see it during the budget time or before budget?

525
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:55,915
It'll probably be a budget time.

526
00:30:56,315 --> 00:30:56,775
Budget time.

527
00:30:56,795 --> 00:30:58,375
We're well into the cycle right now.

528
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:02,671
So I will be submitting it in my next budget request.

529
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:03,891
Thank you.

530
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:05,852
Council Member Kern.

531
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,712
Thank you, President Caravello.

532
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,813
Chief, along the same lines, great to see two monitors.

533
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:18,715
I think it's going to, one of the main complaints we get is speeding, and I think it's going to help curb the speeding issues we have.

534
00:31:19,135 --> 00:31:26,517
With regards to that, I know we had spoke, and you were before us maybe a few months ago, with regards to, and we were asking questions with regards to the radar guns.

535
00:31:27,061 --> 00:31:30,644
Was that also on your wish list and it just didn't make the cut tonight, or?

536
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:38,131
No, we're actually purchasing some new radar equipment out of our existing budget, out of the public safety account in our budget.

537
00:31:39,352 --> 00:31:43,035
And how many, what are you purchasing?

538
00:31:43,075 --> 00:31:46,519
I believe it'll be for handheld radar units.

539
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:47,920
Oh, great.

540
00:31:49,962 --> 00:31:51,143
What account will that be coming out of?

541
00:31:51,163 --> 00:31:53,445
I believe it's public safety.

542
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:00,899
But it will be coming out of the budget that we set in June.

543
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:02,920
The existing budget that we're operating with.

544
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:05,600
Great.

545
00:32:06,261 --> 00:32:10,002
And it's good just to see new cruisers and invest along with the other.

546
00:32:10,082 --> 00:32:24,306
I know there's, I guess, probably another time we can talk about the items that didn't make this list today, because I know each department is in need of, whether it be vehicles in the DPW or radar guns, different things.

547
00:32:24,766 --> 00:32:26,287
We're always hearing about the needs of

548
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:35,312
these three departments, so it's nice to see the list here tonight and nice to move forward on things we've been requesting for quite some time.

549
00:32:36,032 --> 00:32:36,772
Thank you for being here.

550
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:37,492
Thank you.

551
00:32:38,913 --> 00:32:39,773
Councilor DelaRusso.

552
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:42,394
Mr. President, there are no surprises on this list.

553
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:50,917
It's stuff we've either asked for, lobbied for, heard department heads ask for, we've suggested, we've begged for, we've demanded.

554
00:32:51,357 --> 00:32:51,997
Move approval.

555
00:32:52,397 --> 00:32:52,717
Second.

556
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:54,238
You are 100% correct, Councilor DelaRusso.

557
00:32:54,918 --> 00:32:55,478
Councilor Knight.

558
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,667
Mr. President, thank you very much.

559
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,049
And I certainly echo Councilor De La Russo's sentiments.

560
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:02,071
I feel as though this is a good paper.

561
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:04,793
It reflects a lot of the desires and wishes of this council.

562
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:19,964
In reviewing the appropriation, we're getting equipment to keep our police officers and firefighters safe, new vehicles for our police and our DPWs so that they can have the tools to do the job, and equipment to address efficiency of the administration and government, Mr. President.

563
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:21,886
So I feel as though this is a good paper.

564
00:33:21,906 --> 00:33:23,607
I feel as though they're worthwhile expenditures.

565
00:33:24,198 --> 00:33:26,940
And for that reason, I will be supporting this measure and move approval.

566
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:29,261
Council Member Kern.

567
00:33:29,421 --> 00:33:29,661
Thank you.

568
00:33:29,701 --> 00:33:30,062
I'm not sure.

569
00:33:30,082 --> 00:33:32,403
I didn't know if we were taking one department at a time.

570
00:33:32,463 --> 00:33:38,126
If I could just ask a couple of questions with regards to the fire department computer system upgrade.

571
00:33:38,146 --> 00:33:39,327
I don't know if that's.

572
00:33:39,887 --> 00:33:40,608
Deputy Chief Cuniff.

573
00:33:42,048 --> 00:33:45,170
So Chief Kilgood is on vacation.

574
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:49,393
So I'm not intimately involved with these day-to-day purchases.

575
00:33:49,673 --> 00:33:52,214
But I know he did tell me that we needed, he's wanted this for a while.

576
00:33:53,745 --> 00:34:06,111
He said that this will involve more storage, better emails, inter-department communications, and also a maintenance agreement to keep our equipment up to date.

577
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:09,112
So that's basically what I know about that computer purchase.

578
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:20,598
If we could just make a B paper that we get an update with regards to all of these items and what stage we're at, maybe on a bimonthly basis, so that we know in six months the emails

579
00:34:21,311 --> 00:34:24,172
will be up and running, and the flight department will have their new computer system.

580
00:34:24,252 --> 00:34:26,932
And in four months, all the cruises are coming in.

581
00:34:27,753 --> 00:34:32,174
People from these departments do call each counselor and ask questions.

582
00:34:32,234 --> 00:34:41,056
So it would be nice to have a running update with regards to when this is being done, which RFPs are going out when, and when we're going to see all these come to fruition.

583
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:43,676
Thank you.

584
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:44,497
Vice President Mux.

585
00:34:45,697 --> 00:34:46,617
Thank you, Mr. President.

586
00:34:46,817 --> 00:34:49,878
And my question is regarding DPW.

587
00:34:51,401 --> 00:34:58,110
And I see that there are a lot of new pieces of equipment that we're moving forward with.

588
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:03,317
And I don't think anybody behind this reel would say that there isn't a need.

589
00:35:04,038 --> 00:35:07,703
However, I do question, Mr. President, in the future would be helpful.

590
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,883
when we do put a request out for such a dollar amount.

591
00:35:12,484 --> 00:35:28,819
And by the way, just recently, the linkage committee, which you happen to sit on, Mr. President, just expended $435,000 on new equipment for DPW also, in addition to what's being spent here tonight.

592
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:32,102
So I think it would be helpful as one member of the council

593
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:41,926
If we're going to put on a number of items and say, well, we're going to purchase a F-250 pickup truck, I think it would be helpful to know how many we currently have.

594
00:35:42,427 --> 00:35:46,549
Is this replacing a pickup truck or is this adding to the fleet of pickup trucks?

595
00:35:47,169 --> 00:35:55,773
That way, at least we can make an informed decision when these things do come before us, Mr. President, because honestly, I have no idea whether we need

596
00:35:56,153 --> 00:36:03,075
a 10-wheel dump truck or whether we need a 550 four-wheel drive dump truck or a cemetery backhoe.

597
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:07,696
And it would be helpful to get a little bit of narrative other than just the line item itself.

598
00:36:09,497 --> 00:36:21,381
But if you can maybe go through them just rather quickly, Commissioner Kerins, just to let us know the particular piece of equipment, if it's replacing a piece of equipment or if it's just adding to the existing fleet.

599
00:36:22,141 --> 00:36:22,381
Okay.

600
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:26,084
Mr. Vice President, I can put it all in a nutshell.

601
00:36:26,204 --> 00:36:27,524
Everything is a one for one.

602
00:36:28,844 --> 00:36:34,085
Now, case in point, there may be a pickup truck out there today.

603
00:36:34,105 --> 00:36:38,966
We have all good intentions of churning in for one that's on this particular request sheet.

604
00:36:39,946 --> 00:36:47,308
Tomorrow, it could be another one due to a motor vehicle accident or something else, but there's no increase in the fleet.

605
00:36:47,662 --> 00:36:50,191
as far as what I call the rolling stock.

606
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:53,261
Backhoe for backhoe, pickup for pickup.

607
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:02,626
It's when you might get into the specialized equipment, all right, that, you know, we may not, you know, have that particular kind of equipment.

608
00:37:02,646 --> 00:37:07,550
But everything that you have listed, you know, for my request is a one for one.

609
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:08,710
Okay.

610
00:37:08,871 --> 00:37:09,651
That's very helpful.

611
00:37:09,671 --> 00:37:13,034
And maybe a narrative like that in the future would be very helpful.

612
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:14,134
Certainly.

613
00:37:14,335 --> 00:37:15,015
At least myself.

614
00:37:15,655 --> 00:37:17,677
And just the last point I have, Mr. President,

615
00:37:18,264 --> 00:37:28,852
There was a narrative at the end that said, with exception of the police items, the remaining were presented in the draft capital budget presented in the fall.

616
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:35,237
I assume the mayor is letting us know that this was part of the draft plan that was presented, capital plan.

617
00:37:36,078 --> 00:37:38,740
And I would only ask, when are we going to get the full plan?

618
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:44,644
I don't think we should be working on a draft plan still this far into the fiscal year.

619
00:37:45,225 --> 00:37:47,767
And if there are any plans for a full capital plan,

620
00:37:48,347 --> 00:37:53,370
out there, Mr. President, I think it's important that we find that out now, rather than working on a draft plan.

621
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,271
So I would ask that that be part of the committee.

622
00:37:56,331 --> 00:37:57,532
I will bring that to the mayor's attention.

623
00:37:58,152 --> 00:38:10,939
But I would also ask that it be part of the committee paper, Mr. President, that we get a response back from the administration regarding when a full capital budget plan will come out and why are we still working off a draft budget plan.

624
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:11,939
Thank you.

625
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,440
Councilor Falco.

626
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,421
Thank you, Mr. President.

627
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:17,062
I actually have one more question for Commissioner Kearns.

628
00:38:21,275 --> 00:38:22,236
Thank you.

629
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:29,420
So last year I had a resolution to buy a sidewalk plow, to look into buying a sidewalk plow.

630
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:34,183
Because we're trying to push a lot of pedestrian initiatives.

631
00:38:34,223 --> 00:38:36,104
We have Walk Medford.

632
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:38,705
We have a Complete Streets program now.

633
00:38:38,765 --> 00:38:46,470
So we're really trying to encourage people to get out, walk, be pedestrians, and use public transportation and whatnot.

634
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,812
So I don't see anything here for a sidewalk plow.

635
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,063
It didn't make the cut, and I understand that.

636
00:38:52,103 --> 00:38:59,765
But do we have any type of machinery right now that we could use to plow sidewalks in our community, especially city-owned sidewalks?

637
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:05,908
It really would depend on the location and the width of the sidewalk.

638
00:39:06,528 --> 00:39:11,770
There are some sidewalks we can get one of our pickup trucks down and plow.

639
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:16,312
Other sidewalks, we'd have to use bobcats or snowblowers or a combination of both.

640
00:39:20,172 --> 00:39:38,952
those can use like I would just like I mean I'm thinking like if I think of you know I think of like yeah like a bombardier or something like that a trackless plow you know because those things those type of plows and when I looked into it I mean it could zip right down a sidewalk especially in your uh you know your business communities

641
00:39:39,408 --> 00:39:46,573
With regard to schools, I remember when I was on the school committee, we get calls all the time where kids walking to school will be forced out into the street.

642
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:49,815
Like if you walk by Gillis Park down Fulton Street, you're walking to the Roberts.

643
00:39:49,855 --> 00:39:55,639
You're forced out into the street because it's a city-owned sidewalk, but there's no machinery that we really have to plow something like that.

644
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,461
So I mean, I think it's something that should be considered.

645
00:39:58,501 --> 00:40:00,663
I wish I was on here tonight.

646
00:40:01,043 --> 00:40:03,865
I'm happy with what's here, believe me, and I will vote for this.

647
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:08,348
And I'm 100% in favor of it, but I think it's something that we need to consider in the future.

648
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:26,335
And, you know, when we have, uh, you know, counselor, uh, between, uh, you know, uh, the administrative office of public works and, uh, the, you know, the park foreman, Mr. Nesta, we've done extensive research as far as, uh, what types of equipment are out there, uh, that would be suitable for our sidewalks.

649
00:40:26,395 --> 00:40:31,638
Again, you know, we have to keep in consideration, you know, we have hydrants and poles and everything else.

650
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:36,296
So you get something too big, but at the same time something too small.

651
00:40:37,457 --> 00:40:48,128
But it's really a case of trying to get something that would have the potential of being multi-seasonal to get, we'll say, like a bombardier.

652
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:52,464
All right, they're built for one purpose and one purpose only, to plow snow.

653
00:40:53,144 --> 00:40:54,605
They're extremely expensive.

654
00:40:55,226 --> 00:41:04,032
You're talking in and around $90,000, OK, for something that, yes, you definitely would need if the snow was flying.

655
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:09,196
So we've been looking at the various options that are out there.

656
00:41:09,536 --> 00:41:17,002
So even if it's a question, OK, of getting a trackless vehicle to plow the snow, but in the summertime,

657
00:41:17,678 --> 00:41:22,839
okay, could be utilized for the maintenance, the upkeep of the baseball fields or football fields.

658
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:27,721
So, you know, we've been exploring, okay, what would be the biggest bang for the buck?

659
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:35,283
And then we will approach the mayor, you know, with the formal request and the reasons why we would need it.

660
00:41:35,943 --> 00:41:39,484
But something that, you know, 12 months of the year availability.

661
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:41,284
I agree with you 100%.

662
00:41:41,324 --> 00:41:43,685
I mean, I know when I researched the trackless plow,

663
00:41:44,284 --> 00:41:50,729
and it could be used to, there was one that could be used to grind stumps.

664
00:41:50,949 --> 00:41:55,892
There were uses for, you know, summer, you could use it for hauling debris and whatnot.

665
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:59,655
So, but hoping in the future that we'll see something like that.

666
00:42:00,215 --> 00:42:00,776
Absolutely.

667
00:42:00,956 --> 00:42:01,316
Thank you.

668
00:42:02,897 --> 00:42:04,018
Thank you, Councilor Falco.

669
00:42:04,038 --> 00:42:12,845
And the only thing we didn't talk about was the scanner copier that Cassandra has been asking for for many years, and she's not here to,

670
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:21,073
but again, at the last two budget seasons, that is something that she's looked for, and that will be in there also.

671
00:42:21,973 --> 00:42:22,854
Councilor DelaRusso.

672
00:42:23,034 --> 00:42:23,734
Move for question.

673
00:42:24,555 --> 00:42:28,696
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Knight.

674
00:42:31,317 --> 00:42:32,358
Name and address for the record, please.

675
00:42:32,378 --> 00:42:36,820
My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party.

676
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:44,043
I don't have any problems with the requests that are being made, but my problem is in the process that's being presented here to you this evening.

677
00:42:45,735 --> 00:42:54,037
What seems to be unfamiliar is the fact that this present administration talked about this issue of inclusion and being a part of what's taking place.

678
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:59,818
You have the police, the forestry, the engineering department, the cemetery, the highway, and the fire department.

679
00:43:00,618 --> 00:43:07,380
Six departments that you folks, during budgetary time, have heard all of these concerns that are being presented here tonight.

680
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,741
And as a matter of fact, it goes back to the times when I served in this body where some of these issues were there.

681
00:43:13,283 --> 00:43:14,884
This money is coming out of free cash.

682
00:43:15,445 --> 00:43:26,834
And because it's coming out of free cash, which was asked for before, you folks were told, or we were told, as well as you folks were told, at some point in time, we can't use it because it might have an effect upon the bond rating here in the city of Medford.

683
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:32,519
Now, all of a sudden, it's coming out as a $1,100,000 transfer of money.

684
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,385
And tomorrow night, Madam Mayor is going to be making her presentation for the State of the City's Address.

685
00:43:40,357 --> 00:44:05,751
My concern would be if there are more things that are going to be coming that's going to have a cost impact upon not only free cash or maybe even bonding, I think before this vote takes place, I think it probably should be laid on the table for one week, as Councilor Lungo-Kern rightly did some weeks ago on the request of the $900,000 to have some transfer of money from the Water and Sewer Account to pay for the remediation of the West Meffitt parking lot.

686
00:44:06,471 --> 00:44:08,092
Now, you folks have your own rules.

687
00:44:08,805 --> 00:44:21,490
and it's rule number 20, section number four, which states that any finance paper appearing on the council agenda for the first time shall be automatically laid on the table for one week when such action is requested by any councilor.

688
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:33,735
I would think it would be wise by this city council, I'm not saying for you to not vote for it or vote for it, I think it would be wise to lay it on the table for a week and just see what's going to be presented tomorrow night in the state of the city's address.

689
00:44:34,396 --> 00:44:36,777
You folks, unfortunately, have been kept not in the loop.

690
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:41,369
Everything that's being presented here has nothing to do with you folks.

691
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:45,752
You folks have never met with all the department heads to go through their wish lists.

692
00:44:46,332 --> 00:44:50,414
That was something that was discussed during this past election, and it still hasn't taken place.

693
00:44:51,235 --> 00:44:56,278
A magnificence of $1 million here tonight, and the mayor's representative is not here.

694
00:44:57,239 --> 00:44:58,259
That doesn't speak well.

695
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,481
One information council tonight.

696
00:45:00,501 --> 00:45:02,402
I believe the mayor has four representatives here this evening.

697
00:45:03,372 --> 00:45:06,654
The mayor's liaison to the City Council is not here tonight.

698
00:45:06,974 --> 00:45:10,135
Department heads might be here, but they're not the ones that bring the message back.

699
00:45:10,675 --> 00:45:21,360
You know, when you go back and you look at some of these things and you say to yourself, the chief of police just thought through saying six cruises, six new, six regular cars and six cars that are going to be unmarked.

700
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:24,662
I think this council in the past has asked for each and every year,

701
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:28,827
Chief, you can correct me, for a minimum of two new cars each and every year in the budget.

702
00:45:29,427 --> 00:45:33,888
This should have been, you folks should have been dealing with this within the past year, if not more.

703
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:34,448
And you're not.

704
00:45:34,908 --> 00:45:35,208
Why?

705
00:45:35,528 --> 00:45:37,048
My opinion, and it's election year.

706
00:45:37,308 --> 00:45:39,149
And you're getting all this confronted in front of you.

707
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:42,609
You're gonna be getting sidewalks, you're gonna be getting streets, all done.

708
00:45:43,269 --> 00:45:45,930
But where was this money not being used during this past year?

709
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:49,190
During a year which people had to suffer to go through this.

710
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:51,731
Why should the fire department have to wait?

711
00:45:52,663 --> 00:45:56,287
on their turnaround gear that they were promised not only last year but the year before.

712
00:45:56,628 --> 00:46:02,935
And now all of a sudden it's found in a free cash supplement when it could have been at the same time taken out of free cash.

713
00:46:03,075 --> 00:46:06,359
It could have been taken out as of January 1st with the new administration.

714
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,182
The politics behind this is quite obvious.

715
00:46:09,783 --> 00:46:12,446
But even more to the politics of it is tomorrow night.

716
00:46:13,157 --> 00:46:17,102
My suggestion would be to wait until tomorrow night, see what this address is all about.

717
00:46:17,222 --> 00:46:26,793
And if the address has inclusions of other transfers of money or monies that have to go out for the purposes of being bonded, I think you really need to have a discussion.

718
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:30,458
And you, Mr. President, you know, amongst this council, there's $210,000 a year paid in salaries.

719
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:37,210
The executive office, the mayor only gets paid $140,000 a year.

720
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:43,494
So there's more power strength here by what you are getting paid than what that corner office is getting.

721
00:46:43,874 --> 00:46:45,035
And you should put that to use.

722
00:46:45,615 --> 00:46:55,982
And if four of you get together and saying, hey, before we start expending these monies, just right off the hat, Councilor Marks, you've asked for two years in a row for a truck division within the police department.

723
00:46:56,443 --> 00:47:00,085
Nowhere is that found here, and nowhere is it found in the capital improvement plan.

724
00:47:01,246 --> 00:47:05,949
Think about it, in today's day and age, you're talking about email now being in the fire department.

725
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:13,795
I don't even know if they have email in the police department, but if the fire department is now getting email, and they're supposed to be technologically up to snuff here.

726
00:47:15,096 --> 00:47:26,965
We should have the gentleman who runs your computer system down here, and he should be questioned as to what are the problems, and what is the technology needed within this city of Medford, whether it be the fire department, school department, or the city.

727
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,291
You haven't had that conversation.

728
00:47:30,031 --> 00:47:32,052
There's a wishlist that goes out every single year.

729
00:47:32,273 --> 00:47:33,713
The wishlist is never even addressed.

730
00:47:34,474 --> 00:47:40,297
You just got through, Mr. President, talking about the scanner to the OCD, I mean, excuse me, the engineering office asked for.

731
00:47:40,597 --> 00:47:45,280
It's a simple little request that could have come right out of free cash last year, two years ago.

732
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:53,505
As a matter of fact, when the lady was there and she made her presentation before the council, she showed you emails that were sent, emails that were sent.

733
00:47:54,755 --> 00:47:56,056
that the administration wouldn't do it.

734
00:47:56,976 --> 00:48:01,198
So what's being obvious is the fact that you're being asked to do something tonight.

735
00:48:01,558 --> 00:48:08,341
To me, it looks like you're being squirreled into a corner, that if you don't vote for it, you're bad, and you're not doing what you've all been asking for.

736
00:48:08,462 --> 00:48:09,702
That's not what I'm saying.

737
00:48:09,742 --> 00:48:12,704
What I'm saying is you have one more night to wait and see.

738
00:48:12,864 --> 00:48:16,705
I don't see this as being such an emergency that it needs to be voted on tonight.

739
00:48:17,046 --> 00:48:19,307
Your own council rule says the same thing.

740
00:48:19,847 --> 00:48:24,149
Lay it on the table for one week, and if it comes out to be the same when you want to vote for it, go right ahead.

741
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:43,024
But tomorrow night, if the State of the Union address is going to have something that has another financial impact within this community, whether it's coming off of your free cash or a bond or whatever it might be, don't you think you owe it to yourselves as legislative representatives and to the people of this community to wait and see?

742
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:45,345
You've waited all this time.

743
00:48:46,567 --> 00:48:49,209
Pieces have been taken out of a capital improvement program.

744
00:48:50,029 --> 00:48:54,912
All of a sudden, things that you've been asking for just coincidentally happens to be in your agenda tonight.

745
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:56,813
Well, I don't think that's right.

746
00:48:57,174 --> 00:49:03,738
And I think all seven of you should have been brought in to fold, whether you agree with the mayor or you don't agree with the mayor, whether she agrees with you or not.

747
00:49:04,536 --> 00:49:07,298
This is an important issue, many important issues here.

748
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,659
This isn't $10,000 or $15,000.

749
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,100
This is a million dollars.

750
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,263
And the remaining balance of $8,600,000 is still there to be played with.

751
00:49:17,184 --> 00:49:18,985
And you have no idea what she's going to do with that.

752
00:49:19,686 --> 00:49:20,706
That's up to you folks.

753
00:49:21,127 --> 00:49:33,915
And if you folks can't put the mayor together and force that lady to sit down and talk with you, to turn around and say, hey, you may be picking out things that you need, but that's not what this council sees and hears from Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer in the city of Medford.

754
00:49:34,593 --> 00:49:37,795
I just respectfully state to you, follow your own council rules.

755
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:47,441
Hopefully one of you will lay it on the table for one week, see what comes out tomorrow night, and recognize the fact that whatever your issues might be, they're addressed before this.

756
00:49:47,641 --> 00:49:49,422
You know, you have a capital improvement program here.

757
00:49:49,822 --> 00:49:56,907
There's a lot of things in this capital improvement program that also relates back to the fire department, the police department, some of them are in the school department, and what have you.

758
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,548
It would be nice to know

759
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:06,361
Whether a new police department is going to end the offering for tomorrow night, there's $2 million in there to figure out where they're going to put it, draw it, and all of that.

760
00:50:07,302 --> 00:50:09,803
If you have sat down and talked with her or her people, no.

761
00:50:10,503 --> 00:50:11,264
And I think you should.

762
00:50:11,924 --> 00:50:18,367
It's the most pressing issue, the biggest, most pressing issue here financially for the city of Medford, and no discussion on it.

763
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:22,329
But you're getting over $1 million worth of transfers being asked for tonight.

764
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:23,650
Again, I repeat.

765
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:25,761
I am not against any of these transfers.

766
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:35,304
What I'm against is the process, how it's being presented, and the opportunity you have to make sure that before you vote for this, you see the complete and total picture, which I believe will be presented tomorrow evening.

767
00:50:36,025 --> 00:50:36,365
Thank you.

768
00:50:36,445 --> 00:50:36,745
Thank you.

769
00:50:36,805 --> 00:50:40,346
During budget time, everyone did ask every department for their wish list.

770
00:50:41,347 --> 00:50:42,287
Name and address of the record, please.

771
00:50:42,307 --> 00:50:43,588
Good evening, Mr. President.

772
00:50:43,608 --> 00:50:47,049
My name is Paul Camuso of 114 Lincoln Road in Medford.

773
00:50:47,069 --> 00:50:49,030
And it sort of seems like deja vu.

774
00:50:49,951 --> 00:50:53,592
But, Mr. President, I just wanted to come down this evening.

775
00:50:53,612 --> 00:51:01,995
You know, the men and women of the police department, the fire department, this is public safety equipment that's before this honorable body this evening.

776
00:51:02,396 --> 00:51:07,958
You know, the Boston Marathon bombing, we didn't know it was going to happen that beautiful day in April.

777
00:51:09,158 --> 00:51:19,162
The fire where there was about five people that passed away down in South Medford, 25 yards from the firehouse, we didn't know that was going to happen that day.

778
00:51:21,305 --> 00:51:28,987
By laying this on the table one more week or two more weeks, I really believe it's an injustice to the men and women that protect our community.

779
00:51:30,247 --> 00:51:35,508
You know, week after week, we're talking about things down here that are needed in this community to better the quality of life.

780
00:51:37,188 --> 00:51:40,729
And this is a no-brainer as far as I'm concerned, Mr. President.

781
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:46,930
You know, the former councilor just referred to the salaries that city councilors are paid.

782
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:50,571
You guys do a tremendous job for the money that you make.

783
00:51:52,324 --> 00:51:53,406
The collections this year.

784
00:51:53,806 --> 00:51:56,249
I know you guys are working hard with collections to bring in money.

785
00:51:57,071 --> 00:51:58,192
There's a lot of money out there.

786
00:51:58,493 --> 00:52:00,936
There's over $9 million in certified free cash.

787
00:52:01,216 --> 00:52:02,658
This community is stable.

788
00:52:02,939 --> 00:52:05,262
This community is thriving, Mr. President.

789
00:52:06,702 --> 00:52:09,123
And I think it's about time that you take a hard vote.

790
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,823
You spend the money to buy those 12 new cruisers.

791
00:52:12,483 --> 00:52:13,284
You spend the money.

792
00:52:13,404 --> 00:52:19,045
Give the fire department the gear that they need to protect themselves, property, and community standards.

793
00:52:19,505 --> 00:52:24,806
The NFPA, the NFPA says you need a second set of turnout gear.

794
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:29,827
We only have about three or four people in the department right now that may have second and third turnout gear.

795
00:52:31,008 --> 00:52:32,048
And some of those are outdated.

796
00:52:32,068 --> 00:52:32,488
Correct, Chief?

797
00:52:33,513 --> 00:52:34,074
That's correct.

798
00:52:34,594 --> 00:52:43,224
So to wait any longer, to wait any longer, to let anybody get in the way of taking the vote for the men and women of the Medford Police Department, the Medford Fire Department, and the DPW.

799
00:52:43,584 --> 00:52:52,674
And I sort of single out the Medford Police and Fire Department this evening a little bit more than the other departments, because it is life or death when it comes to them, you know?

800
00:52:54,810 --> 00:53:05,385
And I often, I remember when I was sitting here as an honorable member of this council, and somebody questioned Medford's use of money to get the proper equipment for the police department.

801
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:08,951
And it was shortly thereafter that down in Watertown,

802
00:53:10,742 --> 00:53:17,765
in Watertown on that cold April night when they had shootouts and the bombings that were getting thrown at police officers.

803
00:53:18,605 --> 00:53:22,427
And very easily that could have came north on Route 93.

804
00:53:22,987 --> 00:53:29,010
And Chief Gilberti could have got the phone call at his house at 1.30 in the morning and we could have had it going on here.

805
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:35,212
You know, to wait is an injustice to the men and women and also to the taxpayers.

806
00:53:36,033 --> 00:53:38,754
And on top of that, the DPW does need the equipment.

807
00:53:40,169 --> 00:53:40,990
Go up the cemetery.

808
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,411
We have a thriving cemetery.

809
00:53:42,772 --> 00:53:49,218
They're actually doing well up there because people want to stay in our cemetery, in our community, Mr. President.

810
00:53:49,779 --> 00:53:53,903
I know Councilor Marks has been fought for quite some time now for a mausoleum.

811
00:53:54,502 --> 00:53:57,644
I know that that's been on the plate up there, Counselor.

812
00:53:59,045 --> 00:54:01,727
So there's just a lot of good stuff going on in this community, Mr. President.

813
00:54:02,008 --> 00:54:06,771
And I think if you wait one week, I think it's definitely not in the best interests of the men and women.

814
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:08,292
And here's the other thing, too.

815
00:54:08,973 --> 00:54:17,019
We heard the young lady over here and the Commissioner talking about, this isn't a fly-by-night thing like some people would want you to think.

816
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,842
There has been price quotations that have been sent out.

817
00:54:21,772 --> 00:54:26,916
They're coming now with a responsible package with the dollar amount that's going to be needed for this.

818
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:37,406
And furthermore, I find it kind of ironic because this city council as a whole, including myself over the years, have always said, let's do it with certified free cash and not bonding.

819
00:54:37,806 --> 00:54:43,471
Because the former mayor was a big fan of bonding and financing equipment.

820
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:46,133
And he was very, very good at his job doing that.

821
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:47,915
But here we are this evening.

822
00:54:49,883 --> 00:54:58,039
We're looking at spending certified free cash, which I can go back and watch millions of council tapes over the past 30 plus years that the council always

823
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:02,671
preferred, the preferred method, as far as the council was doing that.

824
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:11,816
So I just want to say, I respectfully ask all of the members of the council to support this unanimously and get behind the men and women of the police department and the fire department.

825
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:14,977
You know, these are the simple things that they need to do their jobs.

826
00:55:15,558 --> 00:55:17,659
And it's great being down here this evening.

827
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:19,780
And thank you for giving me the opportunity to address this body.

828
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,882
And there's nothing on this list that's not deserved or needed by the department.

829
00:55:24,603 --> 00:55:27,024
Councilor Knight, show the main question that we put, Mr. President.

830
00:55:28,186 --> 00:55:30,487
On the motion by Councilor Layton, Councilor DelaRusso.

831
00:55:30,507 --> 00:55:32,849
Mr. President, I made the motion for approval.

832
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:34,029
I stand by my motion.

833
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:36,831
I won't be manipulated by political agendas.

834
00:55:37,071 --> 00:55:37,391
Thank you.

835
00:55:38,412 --> 00:55:39,252
Vice President Mox.

836
00:55:40,153 --> 00:55:41,093
Thank you, Mr. President.

837
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:45,356
I just want to correct the record for a minute here, Mr. President.

838
00:55:45,996 --> 00:55:52,280
It was in June of 2016, we as a council started meeting with department heads.

839
00:55:53,212 --> 00:56:22,715
uh... prior to uh... the budget and we sat down in department heads came before us with wish list what they wanted to see in the budget and uh... if i'm not mistaken every council behind this reeling brought up these same exact concerns that we're seeing here tonight eight months ago but now we're hearing tonight it would be an injustice if we waited another week to move this forward

840
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,023
But these issues were brought forward eight months ago.

841
00:56:28,164 --> 00:56:30,426
So was that an injustice for the past eight months?

842
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:32,829
Why these issues weren't moved forward?

843
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:34,430
I don't know, Mr. President.

844
00:56:35,211 --> 00:56:43,679
But this party, Mr. President, has stated time and time again, and I have stated time and time again, I refuse to do business piecemeal.

845
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:46,341
And we've been saying that year after year after year.

846
00:56:46,842 --> 00:56:47,983
It doesn't make sense.

847
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:55,302
from a financial standpoint or a managerial standpoint to do business piecemeal, Mr. President.

848
00:56:55,822 --> 00:57:07,051
I will support these items here tonight only for the fact, Mr. President, is that these issues have been on our agenda and on our plate, turnout gear for almost two years now.

849
00:57:07,852 --> 00:57:09,433
So these aren't new items.

850
00:57:09,934 --> 00:57:13,917
And I appreciate Councilor Penta coming up and Councilor Camuso

851
00:57:14,654 --> 00:57:15,235
Um, it's great.

852
00:57:15,275 --> 00:57:16,876
We have, uh, how many councils?

853
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:19,659
We have nine councils in the room tonight.

854
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:20,860
That's great.

855
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:25,544
Uh, Mr President, we should get all the other past ones to come down also.

856
00:57:26,365 --> 00:57:34,252
But I would state, Mr President, that, um, moving forward and to me, it doesn't matter the state of the city speech tomorrow.

857
00:57:34,592 --> 00:57:35,233
That's great.

858
00:57:35,393 --> 00:57:36,754
And I hope it works out for the mayor.

859
00:57:37,175 --> 00:57:39,657
But I'm not hinging my vote on the mayor's speech.

860
00:57:39,977 --> 00:57:43,302
tomorrow night, because these are items I believe we have to move forward.

861
00:57:43,803 --> 00:57:54,198
But after this, Mr. President, I do believe, as was mentioned by Councilor Penta, we have to have not just a draft capital plan, but a plan on the direction we want to go in.

862
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:57,101
Because at some point, we're going to be pitted.

863
00:57:57,121 --> 00:58:00,063
Hey, you want to spend for this, or are you going to spend for that?

864
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,105
And I think we should have a vision as a council.

865
00:58:03,426 --> 00:58:10,030
We may not share the same vision with the mayor, but as a council, we should have a vision and the direction we want to see this city move.

866
00:58:10,931 --> 00:58:14,114
And, you know, like I said, I'm prepared to vote on this tonight.

867
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,095
These things are well warranted.

868
00:58:16,375 --> 00:58:22,540
We know the DPW, you see their trucks driving around, their blades are all chewed up, Mr. President.

869
00:58:22,848 --> 00:58:24,509
The equipment is old and outdated.

870
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:27,070
And this is a way to replenish it.

871
00:58:27,351 --> 00:58:37,756
I've talked to the men and women in the police department that are driving around in cruises, as I referred to a couple of weeks ago, Fred Flintstone vehicles, where you could put your feet through the floorboards.

872
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:41,138
That's how bad some of these vehicles are getting, Mr. President.

873
00:58:41,398 --> 00:58:42,339
And that's not a joke.

874
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:45,421
So we do need relief in this way.

875
00:58:45,761 --> 00:58:47,782
I think this will go a long way, the turnout gear.

876
00:58:48,485 --> 00:58:58,508
We heard from the chief of the fire department stating a few weeks back that when these firefighters are in a fire, they come back with the same gear.

877
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:04,230
They have to wait for one washing machine that is specially used to wash this equipment.

878
00:59:07,182 --> 00:59:12,723
So they have to wait in line to use the equipment and they don't have a second gear, God forbid, there's a second fire.

879
00:59:13,403 --> 00:59:23,466
And we all know the carcinogens and so forth that from a fire that can, the soot and everything else that goes on the uniform, it's very dangerous for the brave men and women of the fire department.

880
00:59:23,486 --> 00:59:29,887
So, you know, I don't want anyone to believe that if this council did sit on this for a week, that we're sitting on public safety.

881
00:59:30,327 --> 00:59:37,112
because these issues have been out here for months, and if not years, and it's not this council that's been sitting on anything.

882
00:59:37,353 --> 00:59:43,037
This council has been the advocate on behalf of the police, DPW, and fire department in this community, Mr. President.

883
00:59:43,457 --> 00:59:43,818
Thank you.

884
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,900
Thank you, Vice President Max.

885
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:51,023
On the motion by Councilor De La Russo, seconded by Councilor Knight.

886
00:59:52,605 --> 00:59:54,546
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

887
00:59:56,067 --> 00:59:56,948
Councilor De La Russo?

888
00:59:57,188 --> 00:59:57,428
Yes.

889
00:59:58,189 --> 00:59:58,970
Councilor Falco?

890
00:59:59,010 --> 00:59:59,110
Yes.

891
00:59:59,775 --> 01:00:00,275
Councilor Knight?

892
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:01,075
Yes.

893
01:00:01,816 --> 01:00:02,576
Councilor Long and Kern?

894
01:00:02,636 --> 01:00:02,736
Yes.

895
01:00:03,476 --> 01:00:04,276
Vice President Marks?

896
01:00:04,316 --> 01:00:04,556
Yes.

897
01:00:05,056 --> 01:00:05,917
Councilor Scott Pelli?

898
01:00:05,957 --> 01:00:06,237
Yes.

899
01:00:06,757 --> 01:00:07,497
President Caviello?

900
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:08,077
Yes.

901
01:00:08,537 --> 01:00:10,758
Motion of seven in the affirmative.

902
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:14,559
Motion passes and I think this was a well-deserved thing.

903
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:18,740
These men in these departments need this.

904
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:22,461
And if I may yield the chair to Vice President Marks.

905
01:00:28,663 --> 01:00:29,023
Chief Sack?

906
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:32,672
Mr. President, I just wanted to say thank you very much for your vote here tonight.

907
01:00:32,692 --> 01:00:35,194
It means a lot to the men and women of the Police Department.

908
01:00:35,334 --> 01:00:35,634
Thank you.

909
01:00:36,115 --> 01:00:36,695
Thank you, Chief.

910
01:00:39,697 --> 01:00:40,998
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

911
01:00:41,038 --> 01:00:45,541
Paper 17-061, offered by President Caviello.

912
01:00:46,382 --> 01:00:50,645
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the Mayor allocate funds

913
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:56,404
so that we are able to put names of the seven Method veterans on the plaques at Honor Roll Park.

914
01:00:56,965 --> 01:01:05,772
We would like to attempt to have this done by Memorial Day in May so that a ceremony could be held the day or by the Veterans Day in November.

915
01:01:06,433 --> 01:01:07,834
Council President Caviello.

916
01:01:08,695 --> 01:01:09,656
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

917
01:01:10,556 --> 01:01:12,898
Mr. Vice President, this is something

918
01:01:14,174 --> 01:01:19,218
There's some World War II veterans that are on the list there that have been there for a little bit.

919
01:01:19,298 --> 01:01:21,319
I think there's only like seven or eight names on there.

920
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:29,885
And these World War II veterans are getting old and I think they'd like to see their name on the wall before they pass away.

921
01:01:30,366 --> 01:01:38,632
So if we could ask the mayor to find some funding and some budget or somewhere to get those seven or eight names on there.

922
01:01:39,212 --> 01:01:43,355
And if we could also maybe put an ad in the paper for any other veterans that

923
01:01:43,847 --> 01:01:45,529
may be missed out.

924
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:54,101
So if we could do that, it would be very helpful, especially to the World War II veterans who are passing it at 1,000 a day.

925
01:01:54,862 --> 01:01:57,085
So I ask that to the mayor.

926
01:01:57,325 --> 01:01:58,186
Thank you, Mr. President.

927
01:01:58,246 --> 01:01:58,787
Counselor Knight.

928
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:02,604
Councilor Caviello, thank you very much for bringing this resolution forward.

929
01:02:03,385 --> 01:02:06,248
And I really think this is an important issue, Mr. President.

930
01:02:06,288 --> 01:02:08,971
I have brought a resolution of similar nature up in the past.

931
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:13,496
And ultimately, these men and women didn't wait, didn't tell us to wait.

932
01:02:14,383 --> 01:02:15,023
when we needed them.

933
01:02:15,383 --> 01:02:19,364
They enlisted in the armed services, and they went overseas, and they fought for their country.

934
01:02:19,924 --> 01:02:23,065
And I really think that this should be done annually, Mr. President, on Memorial Day.

935
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:25,945
I think every Memorial Day, they should be adding names to the list.

936
01:02:25,985 --> 01:02:32,086
If there's one eligible applicant whose name is eligible to be on that list, then every Memorial Day, we should be doing it.

937
01:02:32,606 --> 01:02:34,346
These individuals didn't tell us to wait.

938
01:02:34,527 --> 01:02:36,207
We shouldn't be telling them to wait, Mr. President.

939
01:02:36,227 --> 01:02:38,927
I support Councilor Caviello's resolution wholeheartedly.

940
01:02:38,947 --> 01:02:42,828
I'd ask that it be amended and ask the mayor to implement an annual celebration on Memorial Day.

941
01:02:43,228 --> 01:02:50,454
where any eligible individuals can be added to the plaque, regardless of the number of individuals that are awaiting placement on a roll pack, Mr. President.

942
01:02:51,034 --> 01:02:51,735
Thank you, Counselor.

943
01:02:51,755 --> 01:02:52,615
Counselor Scott Pelley.

944
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:54,117
Thank you, Mr. President.

945
01:02:54,537 --> 01:02:58,920
I, too, echo my colleague's remarks.

946
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:09,749
I think that we all have someone that has talked to us in the past year with myself and the men and women that fought for our country.

947
01:03:10,407 --> 01:03:26,297
And for some families that have really pushed this, it's been frightening for the fact that they're seeing their loved ones who fought for our country enter their final stages of their lives.

948
01:03:26,617 --> 01:03:32,821
And one thing they want to see is the honor of having their names put on that wall.

949
01:03:32,901 --> 01:03:38,325
So if there's anything that, if we can really push this through and make sure that

950
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:48,204
We can make this happen for our men and women, and I echo Councilor Knight's remarks that this is something we should do every year because you never know what tomorrow brings.

951
01:03:48,244 --> 01:03:53,886
So I really appreciate Councilor Caviello for bringing this up, and thank you very much.

952
01:03:53,906 --> 01:03:55,727
Thank you, Councilor Scott Pelley.

953
01:03:55,747 --> 01:03:56,447
Councilor Falco.

954
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:57,608
Thank you, Mr. President.

955
01:03:57,688 --> 01:04:04,150
I also want to say that I agree with my fellow colleagues and President Caviello.

956
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:05,470
I think this is a great resolution.

957
01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:07,271
You know, there's so many

958
01:04:07,827 --> 01:04:12,174
men and women in our community that have made sacrifice, some have made the ultimate sacrifice.

959
01:04:12,314 --> 01:04:16,341
And we should be making an effort to do this every year, I agree.

960
01:04:17,262 --> 01:04:20,928
We have a ceremony every year at Oak Grove Cemetery.

961
01:04:21,642 --> 01:04:25,945
And this year, actually, we had a procession from Oak Grove down to the World War II monument.

962
01:04:25,965 --> 01:04:29,947
We're actually at Veterans Memorial right near the high school.

963
01:04:30,608 --> 01:04:45,037
And I think to include this as part of that celebration every year, recognizing our veterans, we should make this part of the yearly Memorial Day exercises, unveiling the new names every year.

964
01:04:45,898 --> 01:04:58,174
So if we could amend the resolution to actually make this part of this year's Memorial Day exercises to have an unveiling of the new names, that'd be great.

965
01:04:58,775 --> 01:04:59,696
Thank you, Councilor Thompson.

966
01:04:59,716 --> 01:05:00,137
Thank you.

967
01:05:00,157 --> 01:05:00,958
Councilor Del Rosso.

968
01:05:01,729 --> 01:05:02,790
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

969
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:08,815
I want to thank Councilor Carviello for his tireless efforts on behalf of the veterans of our community.

970
01:05:09,236 --> 01:05:15,441
He's shown true leadership in this part of our civic life.

971
01:05:15,942 --> 01:05:17,823
So I say thank you to you, Mr. President.

972
01:05:18,104 --> 01:05:18,704
Thank you.

973
01:05:18,864 --> 01:05:20,726
With regards to this motion, I support it.

974
01:05:22,187 --> 01:05:24,810
I'm under the impression that every year we allocate funds.

975
01:05:25,762 --> 01:05:33,124
in the approval of our budget for celebrations, ribbons, festoons, and streamers, or whatever it's called, that line item.

976
01:05:33,444 --> 01:05:35,424
So do we know if there's money in there?

977
01:05:35,805 --> 01:05:44,927
I do not know, Mr. I'm sure there's mostly a surplus, so that the money, which we've already allocated for this very purpose, be used.

978
01:05:48,147 --> 01:05:53,689
On the motion of Councilor, President Caviello.

979
01:05:53,709 --> 01:05:53,989
Second.

980
01:05:54,868 --> 01:06:01,814
Seconded by Councilor Lungo Kern, further amended by Councilor Knight, Felco, and DelaRusso.

981
01:06:03,956 --> 01:06:04,696
All those in favor?

982
01:06:05,377 --> 01:06:05,497
Aye.

983
01:06:05,957 --> 01:06:06,418
Opposed?

984
01:06:07,819 --> 01:06:08,479
The ayes have it.

985
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,381
The motion is adopted.

986
01:06:11,782 --> 01:06:16,806
Thank you.

987
01:06:17,247 --> 01:06:17,527
Thank you.

988
01:06:22,965 --> 01:06:25,527
17-062 offered by Councilor Falco.

989
01:06:26,428 --> 01:06:37,898
Be it resolved that Mayor Berk and Chief Sacco contact the United States Postal Service, Medford Square location regarding the postal service trucks parking on Forest Street in the interest of public safety.

990
01:06:42,101 --> 01:06:42,782
Councilor Falco.

991
01:06:45,024 --> 01:06:45,344
Thank you.

992
01:06:45,484 --> 01:06:46,405
Thank you, Mr. President.

993
01:06:46,805 --> 01:06:50,168
First of all, I'd like to thank sincere thanks to Chief Sacco and the

994
01:06:50,884 --> 01:06:54,206
command staff and the men and women that work in the Medford Police Department.

995
01:06:55,147 --> 01:07:03,812
We had a most recent community meeting this past Wednesday at Breed Hall, the old Sacred Heart Church up in the hillside.

996
01:07:04,412 --> 01:07:07,274
And this was an issue that came up during that meeting.

997
01:07:08,035 --> 01:07:16,099
The postal trucks that park outside of the Medford Postal Office, basically every night they line up on-

998
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:22,550
Mr. Cassidy, if you could, please.

999
01:07:23,211 --> 01:07:23,771
Thank you, sir.

1000
01:07:24,232 --> 01:07:25,933
I'm sorry, Mr. Councilor Falco.

1001
01:07:25,973 --> 01:07:26,313
Thank you.

1002
01:07:27,434 --> 01:07:29,015
Basically, every night they line up.

1003
01:07:29,056 --> 01:07:30,397
They park on Forest Street.

1004
01:07:30,957 --> 01:07:32,158
They're big, bulky trucks.

1005
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:41,946
So for anyone that lives in the old Medford High School condominiums, it's really hard to navigate that area and to get out of the parking lot in the morning and at night.

1006
01:07:42,146 --> 01:07:44,448
So it's become a bit of a safety hazard.

1007
01:07:45,189 --> 01:07:50,673
So if we could just, if the chief and the mayor reach out to the US Postal Service, the Medford branch,

1008
01:07:51,182 --> 01:07:57,908
And just find out, I guess, what the strategy is with regard to those trucks.

1009
01:07:58,008 --> 01:08:03,253
Because it seems like over the years from what I'm hearing, there's more and more trucks all the time.

1010
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:04,234
It used to be just a few.

1011
01:08:04,274 --> 01:08:05,475
Now there's a bunch.

1012
01:08:05,515 --> 01:08:08,538
I went down Forest Street on Sunday morning.

1013
01:08:08,878 --> 01:08:09,639
They were all lined up.

1014
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,863
They took all the parking spaces in front of the old Medford High School.

1015
01:08:14,841 --> 01:08:23,425
If we could find out if they have plans to actually find additional parking somewhere in the city for these vehicles, because it's becoming a safety hazard and something needs to be done about it.

1016
01:08:23,505 --> 01:08:40,652
I can report that I did go down to the post office to meet with the postal manager and the new manager was out sick for the last two days and hopefully when I go back tomorrow, because I go there every day, she will be in and I've asked that maybe we could have a meeting to try to find some resolution on where to park the trucks.

1017
01:08:40,932 --> 01:08:48,337
Thank you, and if I may, Mr. President, I believe there is a member of the community that would like to speak on this issue, or maybe a few.

1018
01:08:51,338 --> 01:08:51,639
Thank you.

1019
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:52,719
Name and address of the record, please.

1020
01:08:52,819 --> 01:08:53,940
Good evening, President.

1021
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:58,423
I'm Sharon Diesso, 130 Circuit Road in Mass Ave in Medford.

1022
01:08:59,283 --> 01:09:03,726
I want to wish you a belated healthy new year, and thank you for your time for 2017.

1023
01:09:04,226 --> 01:09:08,409
I just had a couple of small matters that I wanted to bring up.

1024
01:09:09,248 --> 01:09:18,573
One you have to kind of verse me on because I'm not sure how the system works and learning things from different meetings and hearing Councilor Pinter in Camuso, et cetera.

1025
01:09:19,954 --> 01:09:32,900
First of all, for a community that's well known on the map, my neighbors and I had to wait seven years for a strategic stop sign down by Ashcroft Road.

1026
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:33,641
Could I interrupt you?

1027
01:09:34,301 --> 01:09:36,222
We're talking about the post office right at the moment.

1028
01:09:36,747 --> 01:09:37,788
Oh, I thought you were finished.

1029
01:09:37,808 --> 01:09:38,869
We're talking about the post office.

1030
01:09:39,249 --> 01:09:40,610
If you'd like to come back later and speak.

1031
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:41,371
Oh, sure.

1032
01:09:42,572 --> 01:09:46,054
Yeah, so, okay.

1033
01:09:46,595 --> 01:09:51,839
Name and address of the record, please.

1034
01:09:52,219 --> 01:09:55,322
Good evening, John Costas, 25 Salem Street, Medford.

1035
01:09:56,122 --> 01:09:59,785
And that's a sore subject with me.

1036
01:10:00,226 --> 01:10:04,249
I mean, you just brought it up now, but I've been dealing with that for over three years.

1037
01:10:05,361 --> 01:10:06,926
It started out as one truck.

1038
01:10:07,481 --> 01:10:13,085
They used to park in the theater parking lot, and then they were gracious enough to park it in front of their own post office.

1039
01:10:13,946 --> 01:10:22,352
As time goes on, as of November, there were 16 post office trucks parked from one end of Forest Street to the other.

1040
01:10:23,072 --> 01:10:25,154
And it's not like they're only there at night.

1041
01:10:25,874 --> 01:10:29,897
Some of these trucks are there for three, four days, and they never move.

1042
01:10:30,778 --> 01:10:36,402
Case in point, Mayor Burke's been trying to help us on it, because we've been getting a lot of complaints from the renters,

1043
01:10:37,498 --> 01:10:40,521
You can't see the theater when there's five trucks parked in front of the theater.

1044
01:10:41,361 --> 01:10:44,364
And we try to tell the post office and they yeast me to death.

1045
01:10:45,445 --> 01:10:47,347
Sometimes they move and sometimes they don't.

1046
01:10:48,187 --> 01:10:53,332
Well, this year Mayor Burke had spoken with the manager and gave them a solution.

1047
01:10:53,512 --> 01:10:58,757
Because every time I talked to the post office manager, their complaint was, well, what do you want us to do?

1048
01:10:59,577 --> 01:11:01,039
We have no place for the trucks.

1049
01:11:01,639 --> 01:11:02,560
They have to be here.

1050
01:11:03,687 --> 01:11:05,369
Why don't we park them in West Medford?

1051
01:11:05,389 --> 01:11:06,970
They had behind the post office.

1052
01:11:07,671 --> 01:11:09,052
Well, they don't want to drive that far.

1053
01:11:10,433 --> 01:11:18,159
So they seem to think that it's the Medford's responsibility to park their 15 trucks as they have no place to put them.

1054
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:26,467
Mayor Burkett offered them behind city hall here at night, as long as they were gone in the morning.

1055
01:11:26,527 --> 01:11:28,048
So the parking lot could be used.

1056
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:34,392
If anybody ever noticed in the past month, there's been a truck there that hasn't moved all month.

1057
01:11:35,533 --> 01:11:37,373
And there was another truck there for three weeks.

1058
01:11:38,474 --> 01:11:39,174
They don't use it.

1059
01:11:39,354 --> 01:11:40,395
Don't know why it's there.

1060
01:11:40,435 --> 01:11:41,935
Don't know why they lease these vehicles.

1061
01:11:42,015 --> 01:11:44,016
A lot has to do with the new Amazon.

1062
01:11:45,897 --> 01:11:51,079
I mean, I thought that the answer the city came up with was a very reasonable, fair,

1063
01:11:51,805 --> 01:11:53,446
Response, okay, U.S.

1064
01:11:53,506 --> 01:11:55,086
Post Office, you got an issue?

1065
01:11:55,847 --> 01:11:56,707
Let's help you fix it.

1066
01:11:57,327 --> 01:12:00,689
We don't want you parking all your trucks on Forest Street.

1067
01:12:01,369 --> 01:12:02,329
They don't belong there.

1068
01:12:02,349 --> 01:12:04,670
However, we're nice people here in Medford.

1069
01:12:05,351 --> 01:12:06,891
We're gonna give you public property.

1070
01:12:07,632 --> 01:12:10,133
All you have to do is park your trucks there.

1071
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:15,835
And one time when we had some big events at the theater, all their trucks were parked behind here.

1072
01:12:16,521 --> 01:12:17,141
It was wonderful.

1073
01:12:17,322 --> 01:12:20,444
If you ever noticed that a couple of weekends, there were no U.S.

1074
01:12:20,484 --> 01:12:23,506
Postal Trucks overnight on Forest Street because they were here.

1075
01:12:24,366 --> 01:12:27,768
But after about two days, they're back on Forest Street.

1076
01:12:28,309 --> 01:12:39,116
And unless you ask them to move it, they may or may not get the word to the driver's case in point on the KPM Big Bend, they agreed to park them here.

1077
01:12:39,756 --> 01:12:42,198
Well, there were three that was parking in front of the theater that night.

1078
01:12:42,981 --> 01:12:44,883
And I stopped them, I said, you can't park here.

1079
01:12:44,903 --> 01:12:46,725
We've got the OK, you need to park over there.

1080
01:12:46,766 --> 01:12:48,007
And they said, well, no one told us.

1081
01:12:49,269 --> 01:12:52,853
I said, well, why don't you call your manager, because you're not supposed to park here.

1082
01:12:53,273 --> 01:12:59,401
And they had to call the manager, and the manager forgot to tell them, don't park on Forest Street on that Saturday night.

1083
01:13:00,848 --> 01:13:01,448
So they moved.

1084
01:13:01,929 --> 01:13:03,189
They moved and everything.

1085
01:13:03,249 --> 01:13:10,233
So whatever you can do, I know the mayor is trying, but it's a post office and I think you have to use a little more.

1086
01:13:10,933 --> 01:13:13,115
I think it's going to be more than just have another meeting.

1087
01:13:14,095 --> 01:13:19,458
We've had meetings and it works for a little while and then they just go back to their old ways.

1088
01:13:19,498 --> 01:13:20,959
So thank you.

1089
01:13:21,079 --> 01:13:21,379
Thank you.

1090
01:13:21,419 --> 01:13:22,199
Councilor Falco.

1091
01:13:22,359 --> 01:13:22,880
Thank you.

1092
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:24,941
Councilor Lococo.

1093
01:13:26,423 --> 01:13:28,345
I was just going to second the resolution.

1094
01:13:28,385 --> 01:13:30,066
I've received a number of complaints, too.

1095
01:13:30,126 --> 01:13:37,032
And I was also going to ask if it's something that's been happening lately, because I've noticed it a lot on Forest Street.

1096
01:13:37,152 --> 01:13:39,894
But I think Mr. Costa just confirmed November.

1097
01:13:39,954 --> 01:13:40,735
It's gotten worse.

1098
01:13:41,296 --> 01:13:42,296
It's gotten a lot worse.

1099
01:13:42,357 --> 01:13:44,999
And yeah, it's terrible to be blocking the Chevalier.

1100
01:13:45,119 --> 01:13:49,743
And I did get complaints from people that live in the old high school that are having trouble.

1101
01:13:50,043 --> 01:13:51,464
So I just wanted to back you up on that.

1102
01:13:51,504 --> 01:13:53,526
I think the mayor needs to figure something out.

1103
01:13:53,940 --> 01:14:03,608
with regards to asking the post office to create their own plan, whether if they're going to have trucks that are out of service for months at a time, then they do need to take them across the city.

1104
01:14:03,628 --> 01:14:12,235
It's only about five minutes, seven minutes to West Medford and park it where there is a lot or figure out how to use the city hall parking lot that the mayor is graciously offering.

1105
01:14:12,495 --> 01:14:15,678
But they do need to come up with a plan for public safety purposes.

1106
01:14:16,587 --> 01:14:17,568
Thank you, Councilor Lockhart.

1107
01:14:17,788 --> 01:14:18,328
Councilor Knight.

1108
01:14:18,888 --> 01:14:25,872
Mr. President, I move to amend the paper to request that the Traffic Commission examine the feasibility of implementing a commercial vehicle parking ban along Forest Street.

1109
01:14:28,874 --> 01:14:31,515
That the Traffic Commission study the matter.

1110
01:14:33,036 --> 01:14:35,357
Examine the feasibility, not implement, just examine it.

1111
01:14:35,377 --> 01:14:44,502
Look, if that's something that's possible that they can do, can they put a commercial parking ban in place there in front of the Chevalier Auditorium, maybe a little bit further out in front of the old high school to alleviate some of the public safety concerns?

1112
01:14:45,207 --> 01:14:53,396
whether it's certain spaces that are at the end of a driveway or certain spaces that are in front of the theater, Mr. President, to keep those areas open.

1113
01:14:53,997 --> 01:14:54,318
Thank you.

1114
01:14:54,998 --> 01:14:55,839
Vice President Marks.

1115
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,701
Thank you, Mr. President.

1116
01:14:57,721 --> 01:15:03,969
And just to touch upon what Councilor Knight just mentioned, there is a parking ban for commercial vehicles after midnight.

1117
01:15:04,629 --> 01:15:05,030
Yes, there is.

1118
01:15:05,547 --> 01:15:10,571
So I'm not sure I would consider these postal trucks commercial vehicles.

1119
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:14,493
They may not have a commercial plate, but they are indeed commercial vehicles.

1120
01:15:14,974 --> 01:15:26,862
And maybe that may be our plan of attack, Mr. President, is to, you know, start tagging these vehicles like we tag any other commercial vehicle that's overnight and see what the response is from the Postal Department.

1121
01:15:27,528 --> 01:15:33,891
As was mentioned by Mr. Costas, this has been an issue for a lot, a lot of months, many, many months.

1122
01:15:34,591 --> 01:15:42,114
And I thought it was resolved some months back when the mayor intervened and offered the parking out here behind City Hall.

1123
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:51,958
I'm not sure how postal workers that walk for a living can say they don't want to walk behind City Hall from Forest Street, but

1124
01:15:52,795 --> 01:16:03,278
You know, maybe if that's too far, maybe we can look at the public lot right on Salem Street, Mr. President, where many of the postal workers park during the day with the business permit parking.

1125
01:16:03,378 --> 01:16:08,800
So, that may be an alternative to park the trucks in there overnight, which is a little closer than behind City Hall.

1126
01:16:09,180 --> 01:16:13,462
So, maybe we can offer that also, Mr. President, as a... Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1127
01:16:14,142 --> 01:16:20,464
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern, roll call vote has been requested, Mr. Clerk.

1128
01:16:21,876 --> 01:16:23,156
As amended by Councilor Knight.

1129
01:16:30,878 --> 01:16:31,778
Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

1130
01:16:32,198 --> 01:16:32,398
Yes.

1131
01:16:33,138 --> 01:16:33,858
Councilor Falco.

1132
01:16:33,918 --> 01:16:34,058
Yes.

1133
01:16:34,599 --> 01:16:35,139
Councilor Knight.

1134
01:16:35,259 --> 01:16:35,459
Yes.

1135
01:16:36,439 --> 01:16:37,259
Councilor Long-Kern.

1136
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:37,619
Yes.

1137
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:38,859
Vice-President Marks.

1138
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,220
Yes.

1139
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:41,460
Councilor Scott Paoli.

1140
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:41,800
Yes.

1141
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:43,020
President Caviello.

1142
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:43,340
Yes.

1143
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:46,601
Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

1144
01:16:47,621 --> 01:16:51,402
Motion by Councilor Long-Kern to move a suspension so that the citizen may speak.

1145
01:16:55,113 --> 01:16:56,235
Name and address of the record, please.

1146
01:16:56,555 --> 01:17:00,520
Sharon Dias of 130 Circuit Road in Mass Ave., in Redford.

1147
01:17:02,163 --> 01:17:11,736
I just wanted to say, first of all, even before the sign issue, I wanted to thank, and I got a chance to do it in person, the fine fire department that we have here.

1148
01:17:12,757 --> 01:17:22,345
There were some things I'm sort of not touchy-feely with at home, and I had a bleep going off in the house last week, and I finally tracked it down to the carbon monoxide device.

1149
01:17:22,925 --> 01:17:28,250
So I pulled it out of the wall, and five minutes later, it started bleeping again on a chair.

1150
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:33,594
So I'm like, okay, this is kind of spooky, but maybe I should plug it back in.

1151
01:17:34,942 --> 01:17:35,743
And it bleeped again.

1152
01:17:36,303 --> 01:17:41,549
So I said, maybe, and I called the neighbor and I said, I think I'm going to have to sleep with my windows open tonight.

1153
01:17:41,569 --> 01:17:42,770
And they said, no, don't do that.

1154
01:17:43,331 --> 01:17:49,196
So I called the fire department, left the device on the front porch, and it started bleeping on the front porch.

1155
01:17:49,757 --> 01:17:54,382
So up they came five minutes later, the old trusty guys with the boots and everything else.

1156
01:17:55,022 --> 01:18:07,491
And they went right through my house, very courteously, did their job with the monitors, explained, you know, something to me about the device, and made sure I checked and see if I was okay, and then they left.

1157
01:18:07,531 --> 01:18:08,392
So thank you again.

1158
01:18:08,412 --> 01:18:10,694
I just happened to see him here tonight.

1159
01:18:10,754 --> 01:18:11,294
Good timing.

1160
01:18:11,794 --> 01:18:16,758
So we have some really fine police and people who are looking for our safety.

1161
01:18:17,278 --> 01:18:21,421
So on the line of safety, I have two notes tonight.

1162
01:18:22,422 --> 01:18:23,743
It's highly unordinary.

1163
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:33,173
that a very busy corner that is complained about, written about, called about, written about, met about, should wait seven years for a stop sign.

1164
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:35,773
I think it's unacceptable.

1165
01:18:36,394 --> 01:18:37,154
And Ashcroft Road.

1166
01:18:37,174 --> 01:18:37,694
Which street was that?

1167
01:18:38,094 --> 01:18:38,874
Ashcroft Road.

1168
01:18:38,894 --> 01:18:39,654
Sorry?

1169
01:18:40,335 --> 01:18:41,015
Ashcroft Road.

1170
01:18:41,255 --> 01:18:41,735
Ashcroft Road?

1171
01:18:41,855 --> 01:18:43,256
Yeah, in corner of Mass Ave.

1172
01:18:44,296 --> 01:18:44,876
It's in now.

1173
01:18:45,556 --> 01:18:46,877
So we kind of gave up.

1174
01:18:47,697 --> 01:18:51,698
So about two weeks ago, I was coming home and I saw the stop sign.

1175
01:18:52,168 --> 01:18:57,630
So thank you, whoever did in the end, after my letters, get it in, it's okay.

1176
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:06,533
But on the whole light of everything, that's not acceptable in any city, whether it be Kalamazoo or Meffitt, Massachusetts, it's been a long time.

1177
01:19:06,993 --> 01:19:10,154
We're waiting for someone, hopefully never to get hit.

1178
01:19:10,254 --> 01:19:12,455
My neighbor's car was totaled on that corner.

1179
01:19:13,656 --> 01:19:16,837
We were hoping that no child or pedestrian would be involved.

1180
01:19:17,897 --> 01:19:20,738
So thanks again for anyone who did speak

1181
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,672
I can't say speed it up, who accomplished this.

1182
01:19:24,532 --> 01:19:40,636
On Mystic Avenue, on the grounds of safety, coming north or going south, right by Joseph's Transportation, there is an island there that's about five inches high, and it borders, it's the meridian.

1183
01:19:41,337 --> 01:19:49,599
If you're going north on Mystic Avenue from Somerville, you have to take a turn towards the left to kind of

1184
01:19:50,023 --> 01:19:55,127
get by that island, you can go make a U-turn, take a left onto Harvard, you can't go straight.

1185
01:19:55,707 --> 01:19:57,108
You can't see the island.

1186
01:19:57,528 --> 01:20:03,873
You dearly need reflectors there, because I was waiting for this too to happen.

1187
01:20:04,053 --> 01:20:14,200
Last week I was coming home from the college, and it might usually have fog at the end of the day, and I'm like, oh, remember the island, you have to watch for it, because it's not visible.

1188
01:20:15,004 --> 01:20:21,389
A man coming the other way, not at a high speed, took the turn, never saw the island, landed on the island.

1189
01:20:21,429 --> 01:20:24,591
People were yelling, and the poor guy was beside himself.

1190
01:20:25,552 --> 01:20:26,413
Everyone stopped.

1191
01:20:26,793 --> 01:20:28,094
He was able to back off.

1192
01:20:28,535 --> 01:20:36,481
He looked a little dazed, and then he went around, past Dunkin' Donuts and Harrows, and then proceeded south on Mystic Avenue.

1193
01:20:36,901 --> 01:20:40,364
Is that state, or is that section of the road Medford?

1194
01:20:40,404 --> 01:20:41,304
That is a state road.

1195
01:20:41,485 --> 01:20:41,865
It is correct.

1196
01:20:42,466 --> 01:20:43,847
So what's the next route for me?

1197
01:20:44,127 --> 01:20:53,410
We can refer that to Councilor, I think Councilor Barber, I mean Representative Barber, that's her district, and I can call her tomorrow and make that request.

1198
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:57,131
Especially with the snow coming, they're probably going to have to put the newer, higher reflectors.

1199
01:20:57,551 --> 01:20:59,612
I hope you're in agreement with this, okay?

1200
01:21:00,692 --> 01:21:08,895
Also, on monies, I was reading during the year that to get finalized that you had a commission that was paid

1201
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:15,563
to look at the structure that's across from the bus terminal near the old cemetery.

1202
01:21:16,263 --> 01:21:19,104
And that's going to be pot grant money in pot, $250,000.

1203
01:21:19,264 --> 01:21:20,785
That's a quarter of a million dollars.

1204
01:21:20,805 --> 01:21:23,827
That's 250 quarters of taxpayers, maybe $1,000 a quarter, to erect something there.

1205
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:32,630
where people can eat their lunch.

1206
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:33,891
This is winter.

1207
01:21:34,231 --> 01:21:37,051
How many people do you really think are going to go in there and eat lunch?

1208
01:21:37,591 --> 01:21:41,612
It is beside my friends and I how things like this get passed.

1209
01:21:42,052 --> 01:21:45,633
How many cruises could have been bought during the years with $250,000?

1210
01:21:47,093 --> 01:21:54,855
Just because you get a grant and somebody has an idea that the structure hasn't been used, you know, we respect you so much and we need you here.

1211
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:55,855
You're our voices.

1212
01:21:56,413 --> 01:21:58,694
But couldn't that money be allocated at one time?

1213
01:21:58,734 --> 01:22:09,557
Couldn't someone come forth and say, wait a minute, we have a better place to spend $250,000, and I was here last year when the police chief was coming up practically begging for new equipment.

1214
01:22:10,077 --> 01:22:14,699
This could have been processed, and these gentlemen would not have to have been here tonight.

1215
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:19,941
So I don't know if that's possible, if you can rethink money during the year.

1216
01:22:19,961 --> 01:22:23,822
I really think if you had a leak in your roof, you wouldn't go fix your shed.

1217
01:22:24,482 --> 01:22:26,464
So, thank you for listening to me.

1218
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:29,026
I'm just a peon when it comes to economics.

1219
01:22:29,046 --> 01:22:29,366
Thank you.

1220
01:22:29,686 --> 01:22:32,729
And I will speak to Representative Bobbitt tomorrow about that.

1221
01:22:32,749 --> 01:22:32,989
Thank you.

1222
01:22:33,109 --> 01:22:33,449
Thank you.

1223
01:22:33,870 --> 01:22:36,552
Motion by Councilor Langel-Kernan to revert back to regular business.

1224
01:22:39,682 --> 01:22:58,708
16-0-6, 17-0-6-3, offered by Councilor Falco, whereas the Medford Board of Appeals meets on a monthly basis to make decisions about various projects and developments, whereas many of the meetings are conducted in room 201 in Medford City Hall, where there is a limited amount of seating.

1225
01:23:00,248 --> 01:23:08,351
Be it resolved that moving forward that all Medford Board of Appeals meetings take place in all the chambers at City Hall to give all residents

1226
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:11,795
the opportunity to attend and to participate.

1227
01:23:11,955 --> 01:23:12,916
Counselor Belko.

1228
01:23:13,997 --> 01:23:14,899
Thank you, Mr. President.

1229
01:23:14,919 --> 01:23:26,572
Throughout the years, I've gone to many Board of Appeals meetings just to see different, just to, you know, when the different issues come up on the agenda.

1230
01:23:27,346 --> 01:23:29,847
just go down and take a look to see what's going on in the community.

1231
01:23:30,447 --> 01:23:33,988
And I've gotten calls from other people as well that have attended these meetings.

1232
01:23:34,608 --> 01:23:38,810
And usually, the meetings are held in room 201, for the most part.

1233
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:41,951
And in room 201, there's very limited seating.

1234
01:23:42,611 --> 01:23:45,592
I think it's about maybe 20 seats, a table up in the front.

1235
01:23:46,512 --> 01:23:52,534
And it seems like any meeting you go to, if there's a big issue, there are a number of people just standing in the hallways.

1236
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:56,535
They can't weigh in on any type of issue, or they have to wait in line.

1237
01:23:57,237 --> 01:24:06,626
or they miss the presentation that maybe the developer's giving, and it just doesn't seem, in this day and age, like it's a proper place to have a meeting.

1238
01:24:07,186 --> 01:24:08,668
There's no audio-visual equipment.

1239
01:24:09,248 --> 01:24:11,070
It's just too small.

1240
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:13,092
I don't find it very transparent.

1241
01:24:13,112 --> 01:24:17,676
If you have to wait in the hallway, and you can't even hear what's going on in the room, it doesn't make sense.

1242
01:24:18,096 --> 01:24:19,017
We live in a big city.

1243
01:24:19,558 --> 01:24:21,139
Over 55,000, close to 60,000 people live here.

1244
01:24:24,272 --> 01:24:26,013
This community is hot for development.

1245
01:24:26,513 --> 01:24:27,334
People want to develop.

1246
01:24:28,114 --> 01:24:34,597
And there are many development meetings and zoning board decisions that have happened in the past, and that will be happening in the future.

1247
01:24:35,418 --> 01:24:41,441
And everyone should be able to weigh in on these different issues that come before the zoning board.

1248
01:24:43,662 --> 01:24:45,143
If I may finish.

1249
01:24:46,688 --> 01:24:51,492
So in my opinion, I believe that those meetings should be held here in chambers.

1250
01:24:51,732 --> 01:24:54,354
I know they meet on Tuesday night usually, which is the same night as us.

1251
01:24:54,634 --> 01:24:57,676
But what they can do is maybe they can move to Wednesday nights.

1252
01:24:58,357 --> 01:24:59,658
They can pick a different night.

1253
01:24:59,818 --> 01:25:02,700
Wednesday nights, I don't think this chamber is being used on a regular basis.

1254
01:25:03,201 --> 01:25:04,402
But it needs to be looked at.

1255
01:25:05,287 --> 01:25:19,137
We need to make this process, we need to bring the process into the 21st century where people can come, if there's a presentation, they can use the AV equipment here, but it shouldn't be in a room where you can barely fit 20 people and people feel like they're excluded.

1256
01:25:20,258 --> 01:25:23,120
You know, government should be transparent, that's what it's all about.

1257
01:25:23,621 --> 01:25:26,283
People should have access, and I think this would be a better venue.

1258
01:25:26,743 --> 01:25:27,063
Thank you.

1259
01:25:27,103 --> 01:25:27,884
I think the question is,

1260
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:29,815
the meeting should be moved to Wednesday night.

1261
01:25:29,835 --> 01:25:34,059
So because the Board of Heals does meet on a Tuesday evening, the same as we do.

1262
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:35,800
Absolutely.

1263
01:25:36,721 --> 01:25:42,005
If we could amend it to actually have them move their night to Wednesday night and have it here in council chambers.

1264
01:25:42,105 --> 01:25:42,366
Thank you.

1265
01:25:42,506 --> 01:25:43,787
Thank you, Mr. President.

1266
01:25:43,807 --> 01:25:45,088
As amended by Councilor Falco.

1267
01:25:45,148 --> 01:25:45,989
Councilor Longo-Kern.

1268
01:25:46,129 --> 01:25:47,650
Thank you, President Carviello.

1269
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:50,653
I second the paper, second approval for the motion.

1270
01:25:50,673 --> 01:25:55,737
Um, I've received complaints myself and as we come in on a Tuesday night at the

1271
01:25:56,261 --> 01:26:12,530
during the once a month when the Zoning Board of Appeals meets, we see a crowd outside the hallway and I have received complaints about people that weren't able to speak, they weren't able to hear, and I think it's extremely important that anybody and everybody be able to hear any meeting that goes on at City Hall.

1272
01:26:12,990 --> 01:26:22,415
But time after time, month after month, that is the one board that meets where the doors are overflowing because you have attorneys, you have residents, you have business owners,

1273
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,441
People from the city council do want to attend.

1274
01:26:25,501 --> 01:26:26,321
We're not able to.

1275
01:26:26,681 --> 01:26:28,782
So I agree with moving it to another night.

1276
01:26:29,202 --> 01:26:31,322
I also agree that here would be the right place.

1277
01:26:31,842 --> 01:26:36,044
I would ask that we amend this and request that the meetings be televised as well.

1278
01:26:36,744 --> 01:26:41,885
I think we need to start moving more and more towards televised board and commission meetings.

1279
01:26:41,945 --> 01:26:45,326
And that is one of the biggest and most important boards we have in the city.

1280
01:26:45,726 --> 01:26:52,028
And it's something that I would definitely want to attend more often or at least be able to have that opportunity to watch from home.

1281
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:58,232
We as city councilors are being asked to get involved with certain projects and ask for help.

1282
01:26:59,073 --> 01:27:00,273
Neighbors are asking us for help.

1283
01:27:00,333 --> 01:27:09,557
So it's important that we have that opportunity to not only watch the meetings, attend the meetings, speak at the meetings, but everybody should be able to attend the meetings and be able to hear and speak.

1284
01:27:09,977 --> 01:27:17,120
So I think it's a great resolve and I think it's definitely a positive and I move approval or second the approval of Councilor Falco.

1285
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:18,501
Thank you, Councilor.

1286
01:27:18,741 --> 01:27:19,241
Councilor Knight.

1287
01:27:20,055 --> 01:27:22,277
Mr. President, I, too, feel as though the room is too small.

1288
01:27:22,917 --> 01:27:29,321
I really don't see any problem with having the meetings at a room that has a capacity of no less than 100 people.

1289
01:27:29,341 --> 01:27:30,983
It doesn't necessarily have to be the Alden Chambers.

1290
01:27:31,743 --> 01:27:34,245
We had a great presentation here by Barbara Kerr a couple of weeks ago.

1291
01:27:34,285 --> 01:27:38,187
Hopefully, if we get a library grant, we're going to have a great library community space in the library.

1292
01:27:38,608 --> 01:27:41,970
We have the South Metro Fire Station as a community space, so there are other

1293
01:27:42,830 --> 01:27:45,490
available locales that these meetings can be held.

1294
01:27:45,851 --> 01:27:48,711
If they want to use the Alden Chambers, that's all well and good too, Mr. President.

1295
01:27:48,731 --> 01:27:50,251
But I do think that the room is too small.

1296
01:27:50,631 --> 01:28:02,914
I do think that they can take affirmative steps to address the problem right now, especially in light of the small number of contentious developments that have been before the Zoning Board of Appeals in recent months, Mr. President.

1297
01:28:02,934 --> 01:28:04,274
So I support the resolution.

1298
01:28:04,594 --> 01:28:08,635
However, I feel as though putting it in the Alden Chambers isn't necessarily the end all, be all.

1299
01:28:08,675 --> 01:28:10,115
There are other opportunities available.

1300
01:28:10,706 --> 01:28:20,193
And my question as to whether or not if we're going to send a message to the Zoning Board of Appeals that they need to have a meeting, and the meeting has to be accessible to people, that we're dictating where it has to be as well.

1301
01:28:20,374 --> 01:28:27,839
I think that if we can look at the number of seats that are available in the room, I think that that might be able to be something that's helpful in controlling the situation as well, Mr. President.

1302
01:28:28,180 --> 01:28:33,544
However, in terms of the resolutions before the body this evening, I have no problem supporting it as authored.

1303
01:28:34,004 --> 01:28:34,885
Thank you, Councilor Inouye.

1304
01:28:35,385 --> 01:28:36,166
Councilor Del Rosso.

1305
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:39,829
Mr. President, I agree with everything that's been presented, and I'm grateful

1306
01:28:40,740 --> 01:28:43,141
Councilor Falco for bringing this up.

1307
01:28:44,481 --> 01:28:53,883
While this certainly has been discussed before on some level, however, I have a problem.

1308
01:28:54,163 --> 01:28:55,184
I won't say a problem.

1309
01:28:55,264 --> 01:29:09,587
I have a suggestion to remedy the language, and that is to add the note of suggestion, because I won't support this, Councilor, Mr. President, because on the grounds that that is a semi

1310
01:29:10,341 --> 01:29:11,201
judicial body.

1311
01:29:12,022 --> 01:29:17,883
It is to be independent from undue political influence, and I won't be a party to that.

1312
01:29:19,123 --> 01:29:20,224
Thank you, Councilor Del Rosso.

1313
01:29:20,584 --> 01:29:21,484
Vice President Mox.

1314
01:29:22,484 --> 01:29:27,106
Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank Councilor Felco for offering this tonight.

1315
01:29:28,206 --> 01:29:31,167
You know, I think this does apply across the board.

1316
01:29:31,187 --> 01:29:32,507
I know comments were made.

1317
01:29:33,127 --> 01:29:36,668
It's not just the Zoning Board or Community Development Board.

1318
01:29:37,068 --> 01:29:38,389
It's every board and commission.

1319
01:29:38,869 --> 01:29:39,489
And I might add,

1320
01:29:39,861 --> 01:29:40,883
including this council.

1321
01:29:41,364 --> 01:29:43,849
There's been a number of meetings we've had in our council room in 2007.

1322
01:29:44,914 --> 01:29:46,455
where there was an overflow in the hall.

1323
01:29:47,236 --> 01:29:53,581
And I didn't hear an outcry about the members of the council saying, make sure everyone's in here for transparency.

1324
01:29:54,001 --> 01:29:56,383
So I think we have to be very careful.

1325
01:29:57,143 --> 01:30:00,326
And I've been to these community development boards and the zoning boards.

1326
01:30:00,966 --> 01:30:04,209
And in these meetings, they look at site plan.

1327
01:30:04,549 --> 01:30:05,810
They look at schematics.

1328
01:30:06,410 --> 01:30:09,653
And this is a tough setup to do in that type of format.

1329
01:30:10,473 --> 01:30:14,255
And that's why they have a lengthy table in front of them and so forth.

1330
01:30:14,675 --> 01:30:25,399
So I think what we can do is make a recommendation as a council that with any board and commission, including this council, if there is overflow, that they move into a larger capacity area.

1331
01:30:25,919 --> 01:30:30,921
And I think that covers everything, rather than saying you have to move here, you have to do this or do that.

1332
01:30:31,282 --> 01:30:32,382
I think that covers everything.

1333
01:30:32,442 --> 01:30:39,505
So if there's an overflow, Mr. President, I think common sense should prevail that you move into a room where everyone can participate.

1334
01:30:40,065 --> 01:30:41,506
That's what Councilor Falco is getting at.

1335
01:30:41,787 --> 01:30:44,709
This is a participating resolution.

1336
01:30:45,129 --> 01:30:50,434
It is open and transparent, and I agree with that.

1337
01:30:50,494 --> 01:31:03,285
But I'm not sure we solve all that by just having people come into this chamber, because they may have meetings with just a few people, and it'd be a difficult place to sit down with a few people, because it's not set up for that.

1338
01:31:04,943 --> 01:31:14,768
That would be my recommendation, Mr. President, if an overflow takes place, that a suitable room be found by any board commission or Meffitt City Council.

1339
01:31:15,468 --> 01:31:18,569
As amended by Councilor, Vice President Marks.

1340
01:31:19,570 --> 01:31:20,110
Councilor Knight.

1341
01:31:20,690 --> 01:31:33,276
Mr. President, I thank Councilor Marks for bringing up the issue of the fact that there are many boards and commissions in this community and if we're going to be requesting a policy change, that the policy change should be across the board and should not be singling out one board or one commission.

1342
01:31:34,141 --> 01:31:48,044
I certainly also appreciate Councilor DelaRusso's position that where we have quasi-judicial and quasi-independent boards here in the community that we do need to watch the way we speak in terms of making requests of them.

1343
01:31:48,064 --> 01:31:52,644
A suggestion or a request, I think, rather than a demand would be something that would be a little bit more beneficial.

1344
01:31:53,565 --> 01:32:00,046
As such, I want to thank both of my colleagues on the council for sharing their insight and input because it certainly had an effect on the way I'll be supporting this paper.

1345
01:32:00,526 --> 01:32:00,806
Thank you.

1346
01:32:01,939 --> 01:32:02,779
Thank you, Mr. President.

1347
01:32:02,819 --> 01:32:09,322
And I want to thank everyone for their amendments and their concerns and for supporting this.

1348
01:32:09,942 --> 01:32:14,483
But I also wanted to mention as well, because we talked about other boards and commissions and the like.

1349
01:32:14,563 --> 01:32:21,606
And just to mention that I'm in the process of trying, and I know I've talked to you about this, Mr. President.

1350
01:32:22,637 --> 01:32:51,698
in the process of trying to schedule the legislative software vendor to come in and basically take a look at what we do with regard to transparency and whatnot with regards to boards and commissions because in addition to putting everything online, which actually helps out with transparency, they can also install cameras in the council meeting room as well, which would help out with other boards and commissions because you could film all these meetings and they could all be, you know,

1351
01:32:52,152 --> 01:32:53,773
live and on the cable channel as well.

1352
01:32:53,853 --> 01:32:56,375
So that there is something that I'm working on.

1353
01:32:56,736 --> 01:33:00,439
I think you all make great points with regard to those commissions as well.

1354
01:33:01,039 --> 01:33:06,744
And the minutes, the agendas for those other commissions would all be in line as well using the software.

1355
01:33:06,784 --> 01:33:09,186
So I'm hoping to have a vendor come in soon.

1356
01:33:09,826 --> 01:33:11,247
I'm working on scheduling that.

1357
01:33:11,928 --> 01:33:16,211
That actually is from a resolution that everyone supported last year as well.

1358
01:33:16,892 --> 01:33:20,015
So I just wanted to give you an update with that since we're on the topic.

1359
01:33:21,135 --> 01:33:21,376
Thank you.

1360
01:33:22,463 --> 01:33:23,043
Councilor Nice.

1361
01:33:23,384 --> 01:33:37,996
I do think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that beginning with the new administration, this council made a request that the majority of board and commission meetings be held off hours during a period of time where individuals in the community can meet to come and attend.

1362
01:33:38,676 --> 01:33:45,862
We were in a situation where a lot of our meetings were happening at 12, 1, and 2 o'clock in the afternoon during the week, where members of the general public weren't able to come.

1363
01:33:45,942 --> 01:33:50,546
And the administration did take some affirmative steps to address some of those situations, Mr. President.

1364
01:33:51,937 --> 01:33:58,686
Heeding our advice in that regard, and I think that if we Proceed cautiously and make the request appropriately.

1365
01:33:58,746 --> 01:34:01,469
I feel as though the administration will be willing to listen.

1366
01:34:02,130 --> 01:34:06,996
Thank you councillor On the motion by councillor Falco seconded by councillor.

1367
01:34:07,016 --> 01:34:10,460
I'm occurring name and address of the record real quick

1368
01:34:10,985 --> 01:34:11,946
Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez.

1369
01:34:12,006 --> 01:34:13,386
I live at 281 Park Street.

1370
01:34:14,287 --> 01:34:17,809
I'm glad that we're finally talking about perhaps moving the Board of Appeals meeting.

1371
01:34:17,949 --> 01:34:26,334
Because this council has such a heavy burden of maintaining our zoning ordinances, it's really important that you're able to attend these meetings at some point.

1372
01:34:26,354 --> 01:34:30,536
So a Wednesday meeting, or perhaps let the board choose a day that works for them.

1373
01:34:31,497 --> 01:34:36,559
The next meeting that will have a large crowd will be the Salem Street Development meeting.

1374
01:34:36,579 --> 01:34:38,901
That is already being held on a Wednesday, on March 8.

1375
01:34:39,693 --> 01:34:58,110
Perhaps it would be a wonderful time to test out this room, because anyone who's attended any of these ZBA meetings knows that a developer presentation runs in excess of an hour, where they show you pictures of everything from shrubs to fitness equipment to present their entire project from the ground up.

1376
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:00,292
And that room is very small.

1377
01:35:01,153 --> 01:35:02,735
Saying that 20 people fit in it is

1378
01:35:03,706 --> 01:35:04,626
is an exaggeration.

1379
01:35:04,666 --> 01:35:06,087
It really doesn't fit that many people.

1380
01:35:06,567 --> 01:35:26,411
So I'd like to see, since this is probably one of the most important boards in the city as far as shaping the city, these meetings be brought out into the public, be televised, or at least be in a room that's large enough for all of us to know, and perhaps if we can get those agendas online so that people know that these meetings are coming up, because this is very important.

1381
01:35:26,852 --> 01:35:27,212
Thank you.

1382
01:35:28,072 --> 01:35:28,392
Thank you.

1383
01:35:30,143 --> 01:35:31,944
Roll call vote has been requested.

1384
01:35:32,184 --> 01:35:33,204
Well, Councilor Knight.

1385
01:35:33,384 --> 01:35:39,346
I do believe on the city's website, on the community calendar, you can find the agendas of some boards and commissions.

1386
01:35:39,386 --> 01:35:46,768
Some are better than others at posting them, but that information is available on the city website underneath the community calendar link for some, but not necessarily all the boards.

1387
01:35:47,569 --> 01:35:51,650
Mr. Clerk, could you please read the amendments before we vote?

1388
01:35:54,631 --> 01:35:57,492
Yes, we have one amendment that may move to

1389
01:35:58,522 --> 01:36:02,004
Wednesday night in the Harvard Hall of Chambers.

1390
01:36:02,944 --> 01:36:07,846
Uh, meetings will also be, uh, uh, televised as well.

1391
01:36:08,767 --> 01:36:21,713
Uh, and, uh, if there's an overflow, uh, that the board, the boards of commissions, uh, uh, taking consideration, uh, an alternative.

1392
01:36:21,733 --> 01:36:23,014
Find alternative places.

1393
01:36:23,414 --> 01:36:24,995
Yeah.

1394
01:36:25,055 --> 01:36:25,395
And, uh,

1395
01:36:26,211 --> 01:36:28,192
Councilor Del Rosso to add suggestion.

1396
01:36:30,694 --> 01:36:35,577
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Alango-Kern, roll call vote has been requested.

1397
01:36:35,597 --> 01:36:40,179
So, what would the exact language that we're going to be voting on be?

1398
01:36:40,199 --> 01:36:48,985
Would it be the same language here with the... With potential of possibly moving to Wednesday night in this room, or looking for other venues.

1399
01:36:51,703 --> 01:36:51,823
Yes.

1400
01:36:51,883 --> 01:36:52,083
Yes.

1401
01:36:52,143 --> 01:36:52,704
Suggestion.

1402
01:36:53,044 --> 01:36:54,125
Thank you.

1403
01:36:54,565 --> 01:36:55,125
Thank you.

1404
01:36:55,286 --> 01:36:58,448
Roll call has been requested.

1405
01:36:58,628 --> 01:36:59,328
Mr. Clerk, please.

1406
01:36:59,348 --> 01:37:01,750
So where is that going to be inserted?

1407
01:37:27,396 --> 01:37:28,757
Accommodate the crowd.

1408
01:37:28,817 --> 01:37:28,978
Yeah.

1409
01:37:28,998 --> 01:37:29,058
Yes.

1410
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:29,458
All right.

1411
01:37:56,783 --> 01:37:58,803
So we're gonna add the word suggestion in there.

1412
01:37:58,823 --> 01:38:02,264
Why can't we make it for all boards and commissions?

1413
01:38:03,384 --> 01:38:06,445
Because Counselor Falco has only asked for the Board of Appeals.

1414
01:38:08,725 --> 01:38:10,526
That's the only meaning he's requested.

1415
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:11,866
Right.

1416
01:38:11,926 --> 01:38:18,867
If somebody wants to amend it for all, all boards and commissions, then you'd have to.

1417
01:38:18,927 --> 01:38:21,928
We only have one room here, so everybody can't come in this room.

1418
01:38:25,151 --> 01:38:27,813
Let's say if you want to make it for all boards and commissions.

1419
01:38:27,853 --> 01:38:31,856
We're looking for transparency, why would we limit it to one board?

1420
01:38:31,896 --> 01:38:36,300
So if somebody wants to make an amendment to all boards and commissions.

1421
01:38:38,902 --> 01:38:39,903
I think that's the way to go.

1422
01:38:40,323 --> 01:38:41,444
No one else feels that way?

1423
01:38:41,784 --> 01:38:41,904
No.

1424
01:38:41,964 --> 01:38:44,486
It constantly locks them out of the center.

1425
01:38:44,506 --> 01:38:46,148
Does somebody want to make that amendment?

1426
01:38:46,168 --> 01:38:51,131
I think you'd compromise if you do a board of appeals and all of those types.

1427
01:38:51,171 --> 01:38:52,753
You could just say an amendment.

1428
01:38:54,365 --> 01:38:55,365
Just compromise.

1429
01:38:55,385 --> 01:38:57,406
I just suggest that we compromise.

1430
01:38:57,446 --> 01:39:02,867
You leave the Board of Appeals language in and then also add and any and all other boards.

1431
01:39:04,708 --> 01:39:06,088
Any other city boards and commissions.

1432
01:39:06,108 --> 01:39:07,909
All right, you got that Mr. Clerk?

1433
01:39:08,669 --> 01:39:08,729
Yes.

1434
01:39:08,749 --> 01:39:08,809
Yes.

1435
01:39:08,829 --> 01:39:10,209
Mr. Clerk, if you could please.

1436
01:39:10,249 --> 01:39:14,050
Mr. Clerk, if you could call the roll please.

1437
01:39:29,645 --> 01:39:40,895
I'm only, uh, I'm only using the, uh, amendment to, uh, to include all city boards and commissions, including these zoning appeals.

1438
01:39:40,935 --> 01:39:42,116
I'm not changing the language.

1439
01:39:42,176 --> 01:39:44,218
It's just an amendment to it, to include it.

1440
01:39:44,618 --> 01:39:54,006
Uh, then I think you all should get together and rewrite the whole language because it's just the first sentence because you already got the, you already got the,

1441
01:39:55,117 --> 01:39:58,879
Whereas the board of appeals, you're amended to rewrite the language.

1442
01:39:58,899 --> 01:40:00,279
So rewrite the whole thing.

1443
01:40:05,902 --> 01:40:07,042
All boards and commissions.

1444
01:40:08,563 --> 01:40:09,564
All boards and commissions.

1445
01:40:12,245 --> 01:40:12,865
Get that Mr. Clark?

1446
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:14,906
All right.

1447
01:40:16,167 --> 01:40:16,747
You got that Mr. Clark?

1448
01:40:16,767 --> 01:40:17,747
All right.

1449
01:40:18,508 --> 01:40:20,469
Councilor Falcone has requested a roll call vote.

1450
01:40:22,369 --> 01:40:23,550
Mr. Clark, please call the roll.

1451
01:40:24,497 --> 01:40:25,417
Councilor DelaRusso?

1452
01:40:25,437 --> 01:40:26,458
Yes.

1453
01:40:26,478 --> 01:40:27,198
Councilor Falco?

1454
01:40:27,338 --> 01:40:27,478
Yes.

1455
01:40:28,158 --> 01:40:28,718
Councilor Night?

1456
01:40:28,859 --> 01:40:29,019
Yes.

1457
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:32,060
Councilor Long and Kern?

1458
01:40:32,100 --> 01:40:32,180
Yes.

1459
01:40:32,900 --> 01:40:33,700
Vice President Marks?

1460
01:40:33,900 --> 01:40:34,060
Yes.

1461
01:40:35,601 --> 01:40:36,461
Councilor Scott Pelli?

1462
01:40:36,741 --> 01:40:36,901
Yes.

1463
01:40:37,401 --> 01:40:38,202
President Caviello?

1464
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:39,042
Yes as amended.

1465
01:40:39,702 --> 01:40:43,884
Motion passes 7-0.

1466
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:46,465
17-064 offered by Councilor Falco.

1467
01:40:47,225 --> 01:40:50,386
Be it resolved that the Mayor's Office contact St.

1468
01:40:50,466 --> 01:40:52,967
Clement's Parish to have them contact

1469
01:40:54,450 --> 01:40:59,713
the various groups to rent the gym to review the parking protocol in the surrounding neighborhoods.

1470
01:40:59,833 --> 01:41:00,654
Counselor Falco.

1471
01:41:00,914 --> 01:41:01,775
Thank you, Mr. President.

1472
01:41:01,815 --> 01:41:12,662
Uh, this also came up, uh, last week during the community police meeting and I've received one phone call since, um, with regard to, I guess, uh, many of the people, many of the groups that rent the gym at St.

1473
01:41:12,702 --> 01:41:13,062
Clement's.

1474
01:41:15,785 --> 01:41:18,587
Basically, when they park, I guess they're blocking driveways.

1475
01:41:18,707 --> 01:41:24,551
And, you know, parking too close to driveways, they're blocking driveways and whatnot.

1476
01:41:24,571 --> 01:41:25,992
So we could just have St.

1477
01:41:26,032 --> 01:41:34,878
Clement's reach out to the people that rent their gymnasiums and just remind them of the parking protocol just to be considerate to the neighbors in the neighborhood.

1478
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:36,039
Thank you, Mr. Feckler.

1479
01:41:36,059 --> 01:41:36,319
Thank you.

1480
01:41:36,780 --> 01:41:37,260
All in favor?

1481
01:41:37,860 --> 01:41:38,061
Aye.

1482
01:41:38,301 --> 01:41:38,461
Aye.

1483
01:41:38,861 --> 01:41:40,763
Motion passes.

1484
01:41:41,383 --> 01:41:42,404
Papers in the hands of the clerk.

1485
01:41:45,305 --> 01:41:46,325
Do you have something, Councilor Floyd?

1486
01:41:49,966 --> 01:42:03,288
In the hands of the clerk, 17-0-6-8, offered by President Caravello, be it resolved that the Method City Council commend and congratulate Richard Dick Fitzpatrick on the celebration of his 90th birthday.

1487
01:42:03,348 --> 01:42:08,469
Mr. Fitzpatrick is a member of the greatest generation who fought World War II to make our country safe.

1488
01:42:09,189 --> 01:42:11,930
I was able to attend Mr. Fitzpatrick's party.

1489
01:42:12,010 --> 01:42:13,430
He ended with a citation.

1490
01:42:15,875 --> 01:42:19,078
Usually when you're 90, the parties aren't too big.

1491
01:42:19,418 --> 01:42:24,802
Mr. Fitzpatrick had about 350 people at his party with the Marine Color Guards.

1492
01:42:24,842 --> 01:42:27,945
So again, that in itself was a tribute to Mr. Fitzpatrick.

1493
01:42:28,705 --> 01:42:33,269
And again, I want to congratulate him for his service to our country.

1494
01:42:38,333 --> 01:42:38,753
Move approval.

1495
01:42:38,773 --> 01:42:39,754
Move approval.

1496
01:42:39,774 --> 01:42:40,134
All in favor?

1497
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:40,815
Aye.

1498
01:42:40,835 --> 01:42:40,915
Aye.

1499
01:42:42,737 --> 01:42:48,900
We have a couple of sick, we have a couple of death things.

1500
01:42:49,140 --> 01:42:56,584
Offered by Councilor Mox, be it resolved that a moment of silence be held for long-time Methodist resident Joseph Panico on a recent passing.

1501
01:42:56,624 --> 01:43:04,669
And we have another one, offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Methodist City Council send its condolences to the family of Dennis Hurley.

1502
01:43:05,749 --> 01:43:11,913
Mr. Hurley, he is a World War II veteran, and his presence in our community will be missed.

1503
01:43:13,835 --> 01:43:14,416
Councilor Marks.

1504
01:43:16,479 --> 01:43:17,481
Thank you, Mr. President.

1505
01:43:17,861 --> 01:43:22,148
We lost just recently a longtime Method resident.

1506
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:30,465
And anyone that knew Josephine Panico and got to know Josephine would know she was quite a spunky woman.

1507
01:43:31,425 --> 01:43:35,107
And, you know, you knew where you stood with Josephine at all times.

1508
01:43:36,248 --> 01:43:38,389
And I appreciated her for that.

1509
01:43:39,130 --> 01:43:45,473
And, you know, as a loving grandmother, mother, wife, she is going to be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1510
01:43:46,234 --> 01:43:46,534
Thank you.

1511
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:48,295
If we can stand for a moment of silence, please.

1512
01:43:50,236 --> 01:43:51,397
Oh, I'm sorry, we have one more.

1513
01:43:52,390 --> 01:44:01,464
Do you have another condolence?

1514
01:44:02,145 --> 01:44:02,386
Yes.

1515
01:44:03,507 --> 01:44:04,128
I already did it.

1516
01:44:04,208 --> 01:44:05,070
I did that one.

1517
01:44:06,372 --> 01:44:07,514
If we could stand for a moment of silence please.

1518
01:44:20,860 --> 01:44:23,202
And I think that is it.

1519
01:44:23,702 --> 01:44:24,262
Thank you, Mr. President.

1520
01:44:26,364 --> 01:44:27,644
The records.

1521
01:44:29,806 --> 01:44:32,967
Records were passed to Vice President Mox.

1522
01:44:33,488 --> 01:44:35,649
Mr. Vice President, how did you find those records?

1523
01:44:36,450 --> 01:44:38,511
Mr. President, I didn't have a chance to review the records.

1524
01:44:38,811 --> 01:44:40,132
Can I lay them on the table for one week?

1525
01:44:41,052 --> 01:44:42,573
We will table those till next week.

1526
01:44:43,894 --> 01:44:48,777
I would ask everyone, if it's wet outside, to please be careful when you're leaving so no one falls down.

1527
01:44:50,754 --> 01:44:52,374
Motion by Councilor Lai to adjourn the meeting.
