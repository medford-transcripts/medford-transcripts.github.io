1
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:11,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, is Jenny on this or is Melanie on this?

2
00:00:11,676 --> 00:00:12,356
[SPEAKER_06]: Melanie's on it.

3
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:14,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, and I'm sitting in for Melanie.

4
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:15,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

5
00:00:16,639 --> 00:00:19,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Just suddenly, I'm like, wait, who else is on my subcommittee?

6
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:21,542
[SPEAKER_06]: So who's the third?

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,304
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Jenny, isn't it?

8
00:00:25,805 --> 00:00:26,505
[SPEAKER_06]: It is Jenny, yes.

9
00:00:26,545 --> 00:00:28,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, I had the agenda right in front of me.

10
00:00:28,106 --> 00:00:28,926
[SPEAKER_06]: I could have just looked there.

11
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:31,248
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I just pinged her.

12
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:26,136

[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe member Vander Kloot, you'll be filling in for member McLaughlin this evening?

32
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:27,536
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, at least for a while.

33
00:04:27,556 --> 00:04:28,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

34
00:04:28,817 --> 00:04:29,818
[SPEAKER_06]: So member Vander Kloot?

35
00:04:30,658 --> 00:04:30,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

36
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:32,659
[SPEAKER_06]: And member Graham?

37
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:33,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

38
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,321
[SPEAKER_06]: And member Rousseau, present, three present.

39
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:37,161
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a quorum.

40
00:04:38,522 --> 00:04:38,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

41
00:04:38,922 --> 00:04:41,003
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have four items on the agenda.

42
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:41,844
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll just get going.

43
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:48,387
[SPEAKER_06]: The first item on the agenda is to discuss possible updates to the format of our agenda for the regular meetings of the school committee.

44
00:04:50,461 --> 00:04:55,983
[SPEAKER_06]: at probably several meetings actually in the last couple of years, this has been suggested.

45
00:04:56,043 --> 00:05:08,588
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a, not a round table, but a sort of a professional development for the school committee with our representative from the Massachusetts Association of School Committees.

46
00:05:09,109 --> 00:05:13,290
[SPEAKER_06]: We saw a number of other school committee agendas and how they're formatted.

47
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:18,933
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all seem to think lots of those other ideas were excellent.

48
00:05:20,602 --> 00:05:45,555
[SPEAKER_06]: And in talking to a couple of members, one of the approach that I'm gonna suggest we take is that we actually take a more evolutionary approach rather than a full-blown revolution by modifying the agenda in pieces and over time, rather than here's a whole new agenda format out of the gate.

49
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:49,477
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason that I personally think that that makes more sense is that

50
00:05:50,177 --> 00:05:59,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, changing the format of the meetings will be, uh, even small changes to the format of the meeting is going to require, you know, uh, adjustment.

51
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:15,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm just quite concerned with the, well, we always have a ton of work, but that a full blown reset, here's a new format from scratch will be highly confusing to the members, to the superintendent, uh, certainly the public.

52
00:06:15,638 --> 00:06:15,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

53
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:20,144
[SPEAKER_06]: do anybody have any thoughts on taking that approach?

54
00:06:23,387 --> 00:06:23,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

55
00:06:24,688 --> 00:06:26,289
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that makes sense.

56
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:45,224
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there are probably some things that we can start to change and maybe we endeavor to change what we can accomplish in the next like 25 minutes or so in this meeting and recommend those changes, implement them, see if we like them.

57
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:56,001
[SPEAKER_04]: see how they're working in practice and then solicit another round of feedback maybe at the beginning of the academic year and do it again.

58
00:06:56,181 --> 00:07:08,907
[SPEAKER_04]: So I do think we should not talk about this constantly, but instead maybe like twice a year or something between now and the time we just all feel like we're happy with it.

59
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:12,289
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I agree, whatever we can accomplish

60
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:16,393
[SPEAKER_04]: in this meeting that we feel good about recommending, we should start.

61
00:07:16,413 --> 00:07:18,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

62
00:07:19,514 --> 00:07:22,374
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Member Radcliffe, did you have anything you wanted to add?

63
00:07:24,635 --> 00:07:25,375
[SPEAKER_06]: No, thank you.

64
00:07:25,515 --> 00:07:26,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

65
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:33,017
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, the format of our agendas, which I'm realizing I don't have one of them in front of me.

66
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:35,297
[SPEAKER_06]: My apologies.

67
00:07:35,578 --> 00:07:37,358
[SPEAKER_06]: There are many documents here.

68
00:07:37,378 --> 00:07:41,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, we go to the last school committee agenda.

69
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:47,959
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't need the whole thing in front of me.

70
00:07:47,999 --> 00:08:00,168
[SPEAKER_06]: So one of the things that I was thinking would be a nice addition, this meeting, last time we met this subcommittee, we met with the student representatives to the school committee.

71
00:08:00,828 --> 00:08:07,372
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was in response to some difficulties going on in Boston with their student representatives.

72
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:10,615
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had, I thought, a very good conversation.

73
00:08:10,655 --> 00:08:13,997
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think there'll be a lot more coming related to that.

74
00:08:14,948 --> 00:08:28,732
[SPEAKER_06]: But some of the things that I thought of as low-hanging fruit was that when the attendance is taking at the beginning of the meeting, that we also asked for the student representative and we record it as attending.

75
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:31,173
[SPEAKER_06]: I had written this up.

76
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:36,074
[SPEAKER_06]: One second, where did I put that?

77
00:08:37,895 --> 00:08:39,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Apologies.

78
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:42,556
[SPEAKER_06]: So in my mind, so we have two student representatives most of the time.

79
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,290
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that can be a little clunky.

80
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:55,152
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, imagine if we were just all not named individuals on the school committee and we didn't know who was going to be at the meeting that would flow in a very weird way.

81
00:08:55,693 --> 00:09:06,975
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I had suggested or thought was that we should, when taking the role, we should take the members first and then

82
00:09:07,435 --> 00:09:14,639
[SPEAKER_06]: simply, if the person taking the role, the secretary, knows who the student representative for that night is, then they can simply say the name.

83
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:26,125
[SPEAKER_06]: If they don't, they can simply say, you know, the student representative, and then just record it that way during the attendance.

84
00:09:28,747 --> 00:09:34,690
[SPEAKER_06]: And of course, as Member Graham mentioned, this can be iterative, you know, if this doesn't flow and doesn't work, or it's just,

85
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,001
[SPEAKER_06]: not working well, we can just change it.

86
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:40,624
[SPEAKER_06]: But any thoughts on that particular idea?

87
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:44,787
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that makes sense.

88
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:55,956
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that we also talked about was around sort of actively asking their opinion or asking for their vote in a roll call.

89
00:09:58,141 --> 00:10:27,960
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel like that conversation was fairly unresolved and we probably shouldn't try to incorporate that now, but perhaps the other thing that we could do where we, you know, we have a report of the secretary, like maybe there is a holding space for a report of our student representatives that we can put on the agenda and they can, just like the secretary does decline or have something to say, but really like intentionally give them some space on the agenda upfront.

90
00:10:32,118 --> 00:10:32,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I do like that.

91
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,239
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

92
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:51,605
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that in terms of the role, it should be done so that the school committee role is called and announced by the mayor and then it should be, then the student rep should be introduced.

93
00:10:52,145 --> 00:10:55,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a differentiation between it.

94
00:10:56,366 --> 00:11:01,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that you're going to spend more time at some point talking about the role of the student reps.

95
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:19,750
[SPEAKER_05]: I had some misgivings or concerns about some areas of your conversation only because in my long-term, I will tell you that there are years that you have great student reps and they're there and they're participating.

96
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:25,896
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's years where you don't, and there's years where you have very confident kids and years where you don't.

97
00:11:26,756 --> 00:11:37,142
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just need to be very, very careful about what we're setting up so to make it a true positive learning experience rather than someone on the hot seat.

98
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:40,744
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to be aware of that.

99
00:11:40,904 --> 00:11:48,588
[SPEAKER_05]: We happen to have had some very strong representatives while you guys have been on the committee, but that's not always the case.

100
00:11:49,288 --> 00:11:53,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were years when, frankly, we didn't have kids who were interested.

101
00:11:56,032 --> 00:12:03,341
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't you don't want to put them in a place of embarrassment either where you're keeping on asking if they're present and they're not or something like that.

102
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:10,930
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just think one we need to I think it's great and we certainly just prior to

103
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:26,048
[SPEAKER_05]: When Dr. Perlow was the head, we had had some discussions because I think Paul, I think you and I had, we had actually gone to a MASC event about student reps.

104
00:12:26,668 --> 00:12:30,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And I talked to many student reps about what their role was.

105
00:12:30,753 --> 00:12:43,085
[SPEAKER_05]: I came back feeling that we weren't being significant about it, but then that kind of fell through the cracks because we changed, you know, principles and we're starting, we started over again.

106
00:12:43,225 --> 00:12:45,067
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, that's my two cents.

107
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:46,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you.

108
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:52,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly don't, I don't, I'm certainly not, I would put it on the agenda if I had proposals that I thought were

109
00:12:55,123 --> 00:13:08,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I think of as substantial, I think like including them in the role, I didn't consider it to be substantial or controversial or there are a whole host of other issues that we discussed in the last meeting, which I don't think can make it into this meeting, there isn't time.

110
00:13:08,492 --> 00:13:10,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that there will be a lot of interest.

111
00:13:10,774 --> 00:13:20,300
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would, when that is part of perhaps the next one of these meetings, I plan to iterate what those things are so that people can,

112
00:13:21,181 --> 00:13:23,102
[SPEAKER_06]: truly know what it is we're discussing.

113
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:33,465
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I would ask about the attendance, while I certainly agree that like having it separate is, I don't think there's anything wrong with that, except that we would then have another item on the agenda.

114
00:13:34,206 --> 00:13:40,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I want it to be part of the agenda so that it doesn't just get forgotten.

115
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:48,851
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, I mean, are you proposing that after the attendance, the next item on there is the student representative

116
00:13:50,532 --> 00:13:52,614
[SPEAKER_06]: attendance or how would you word that perhaps?

117
00:13:54,796 --> 00:14:08,166
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, cause I haven't really thought about it, but I mean, now when they, now often the mayor will make an announcement as she, when we call the roll, she'll make an announcement.

118
00:14:08,226 --> 00:14:12,629
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's sort of to formalize that so that she'll also announce who's present.

119
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:15,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

120
00:14:15,972 --> 00:14:19,555
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I was just thinking of it as asking the secretary to add them.

121
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,491
[SPEAKER_04]: to the list of the role that she calls.

122
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:28,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Like very simply add two names to the bottom of the list and call them too.

123
00:14:30,575 --> 00:14:36,478
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think it's, I think it's more like asking the secretary to do it than it is changing the agenda.

124
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:38,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you have to call the role.

125
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,200
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just adding two people to the list.

126
00:14:43,204 --> 00:14:46,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, but those two people aren't part of the quorum, Jenny.

127
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:48,527
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I was making the- I know, Paulette.

128
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:56,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to simply say we need to know when our student representatives are in the room, and we can't know that right now.

129
00:14:58,633 --> 00:14:59,553
[SPEAKER_04]: I never know if they're there.

130
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:03,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't- Dave has his hand up.

131
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:04,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Mr. Murphy, sorry.

132
00:15:10,812 --> 00:15:11,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

133
00:15:12,173 --> 00:15:32,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for not knowing this, but I'm just curious, in the before times when the committee met in person, would you typically take the full role or would the secretary just make note in the minutes as to what members were present?

134
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:33,922
[SPEAKER_04]: We took the role.

135
00:15:33,942 --> 00:15:34,422
[SPEAKER_04]: We called it.

136
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:35,222
[SPEAKER_00]: You did take the role.

137
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:35,582
[SPEAKER_05]: We took the role.

138
00:15:36,022 --> 00:15:39,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if the students were present, the mayor announced them.

139
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:41,450
[SPEAKER_00]: I see.

140
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:54,819
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize for not, but we're, that's not, we haven't had that practice now, but it's something we could add that practice somewhat easily, I assume.

141
00:15:56,053 --> 00:16:07,282
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think what the problem is, is whether the mayor, what Jenny's saying is she doesn't know whether they're there, and probably Brianna doesn't always know if they're there.

142
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:11,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And so by calling their name, you know if they're there.

143
00:16:11,285 --> 00:16:12,386
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

144
00:16:13,427 --> 00:16:23,055
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Rizzo, if I could just very quickly, my point I think would apply to this conversation and any other element of the conversation related to the student representatives.

145
00:16:23,633 --> 00:16:41,697
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made a similar point at the previous subcommittee meeting, but I think we as an administration need to start by designating an advisor, be that an administrator or a teacher who's working with these students on a regular basis, helping them to prepare for meetings.

146
00:16:42,437 --> 00:16:49,519
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it would also be helpful if there was a committee member deemed to be the liaison from the committee to the students.

147
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:53,220
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be helpful in terms of just sort of

148
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:57,792
[SPEAKER_00]: re-legitimizing the role and adding some substance to it.

149
00:16:58,292 --> 00:17:06,174
[SPEAKER_00]: I think whether they're announced as being present or whether they're called in the role, I think the substantive implications of that are relatively minimal.

150
00:17:06,614 --> 00:17:21,118
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the need to sort of like strengthen the role by making an adult responsible for ensuring that students are having

151
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:28,312
[SPEAKER_00]: both the opportunity to contribute substantively and having a substantive learning experience themselves.

152
00:17:28,773 --> 00:17:32,735
[SPEAKER_00]: That to me is the critical element that I think we're missing at this point.

153
00:17:32,795 --> 00:17:49,466
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's anyone that we've said, this person is responsible for making sure that these two students are informed, involved, and having the substantive experience that the Student Advisory Council is intended to be under the law.

154
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:51,147
[SPEAKER_00]: I think once we do that,

155
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:55,630
[SPEAKER_00]: their involvement in conversations, their ability to contribute.

156
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:00,772
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all of that will improve if we can take that first step.

157
00:18:01,492 --> 00:18:14,016
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have an opinion one way or another whether they're called in the role or whether they're announced, but I think it's clear that we have to make this a more substantive opportunity for the students who are participating.

158
00:18:14,056 --> 00:18:18,797
[SPEAKER_00]: The advisor would also be responsible for making sure that there's an election, which is contemplated by the law.

159
00:18:18,917 --> 00:18:20,278
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's something you have to vote on.

160
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:20,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pretty clear.

161
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:24,574
[SPEAKER_00]: we have an obligation to have an election.

162
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:29,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Elections typically are overseen by advisors, student government advisors or otherwise.

163
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:35,976
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think, you know, we can go from there in terms of making sure that it's a good and substantive role.

164
00:18:37,056 --> 00:18:37,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

165
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:42,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I think I feel like this is a slightly off topic from the agenda.

166
00:18:42,717 --> 00:18:48,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And certainly, you know, the student outreach coordinator, which is actually indicated in a lot is something that,

167
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:54,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I plan to have a conversation with, cause again, we don't have to vote on it.

168
00:18:54,268 --> 00:18:56,069
[SPEAKER_06]: It's literally a lot that we're supposed to be doing.

169
00:18:56,249 --> 00:19:06,776
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, as far as I'm concerned, I can just call, you know, Peter presumably, cause he oversees secondary and that we'll get going.

170
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:18,843
[SPEAKER_06]: But just from an agenda perspective, you know, when I look at the list of notes from that meeting last time, you know, some of these things are in fact controversial, like whether or not students should be voting on

171
00:19:19,545 --> 00:19:23,728
[SPEAKER_06]: substantive items, and if so, which items and which items should they not be?

172
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:32,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I think that's a real conversation that frankly, we'll end up at the main school committee meeting as a very serious conversation.

173
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:42,663
[SPEAKER_06]: But just knowing, you know, as member Graham, and I think member Vanderkloof pointed out, like frequently, we don't know who is there.

174
00:19:42,943 --> 00:19:47,406
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know both the current student representatives faces like, you know, immediately.

175
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,508
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've had communications with them.

176
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:53,489
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not like I don't know who they are, but I still don't know if they're there.

177
00:19:54,050 --> 00:20:02,854
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think getting them to, I've received an email and I'm like, I received an email from one of them today thinking he should be here.

178
00:20:02,874 --> 00:20:12,139
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, wait, there's no reason for you to be here today because I didn't think we were talking about the student representative so much, but they're very much like,

179
00:20:13,727 --> 00:20:14,187
[SPEAKER_06]: on top of it.

180
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:20,970
[SPEAKER_06]: And I do think member Vanderhoof's point about like that every year student representatives are individuals and have their own lives.

181
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:25,152
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's a very important consideration.

182
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:39,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I think the student outreach coordinator is probably the solution to years when there is not sufficient participation or maybe the students just didn't know what their role was.

183
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:52,124
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and I think that that is some of the student outreach coordinator will be able to nail down like nobody's going to want to put this themselves in to be in this role, knowing what it means.

184
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:57,588
[SPEAKER_06]: If they didn't take it upon themselves to know what it means like by looking at the previous year.

185
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So, sticking, we should get back to the agenda because time is not our friend.

186
00:21:07,075 --> 00:21:14,718
[SPEAKER_06]: including who, so I feel like there's a little bit of disagreement about whether or not to just add them to the roll call.

187
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:34,065
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was looking at our rules for the school committee, as I'm working on sort of creating a new draft, what I had sort of iterated was that the members are called, the student representative by name, if known already, and the student representatives

188
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:41,321
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, if we tell them, if you're the student representative of record today, then just email the secretary.

189
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:42,261
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not hard.

190
00:21:43,522 --> 00:21:44,502
[SPEAKER_06]: They can handle an email.

191
00:21:44,823 --> 00:21:46,683
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the secretary knows what name to call.

192
00:21:48,264 --> 00:21:58,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they're absent, the secretary, you know, if the secretary received an email and says, I can't make it today, sorry, they don't have to even call the name and make it a point that the student representative is absent.

193
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:04,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I certainly think we don't wanna like, if a member just stopped showing up to meetings,

194
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,611
[SPEAKER_06]: that's something that the public notices and we all notice.

195
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:13,372
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think we should have that same level of noticing that student reps can't make it to a meeting.

196
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:30,695
[SPEAKER_06]: So it seemed procedurally rather easy to just have the members called, the student rep if present called, and then the announcement of number present and number absent should not include the student representative at all.

197
00:22:31,515 --> 00:22:32,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that that

198
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:38,925
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel a bit like that's where I remember Vander Kloot was like, you know, there's the official body.

199
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:40,506
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't have confusion.

200
00:22:40,546 --> 00:22:44,929
[SPEAKER_06]: It can't be seven, six present and two absent.

201
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:51,314
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, was one of the absent the student rep or, you know, in my opinion, we go through them all.

202
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:56,237
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the announcement of those present and absent is just does not include the student representative.

203
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,481
[SPEAKER_06]: So that it's seven, zero or whatever, like it has always been.

204
00:23:04,375 --> 00:23:09,358
[SPEAKER_06]: That's, I mean, what do you think about that?

205
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,241
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we can keep talking about this if we send it to the full committee too.

206
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:13,941
[SPEAKER_06]: You're muted.

207
00:23:14,402 --> 00:23:14,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

208
00:23:14,702 --> 00:23:18,805
[SPEAKER_06]: You're muted.

209
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:22,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Paulette, you're muted.

210
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:28,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I don't want to belabor the point.

211
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:36,637
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just concerned about making a separation so it was clear for people who didn't know, you know, that they're not voting members or something like that.

212
00:23:36,657 --> 00:23:37,878
[SPEAKER_05]: They're student members.

213
00:23:38,018 --> 00:23:42,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So anyway, I think we should go on.

214
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:43,920
Okay.

215
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:45,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Ms.

216
00:23:45,561 --> 00:23:46,201
[SPEAKER_06]: Weiss, raise your hand up.

217
00:23:48,462 --> 00:23:49,282
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the year of beauty.

218
00:23:56,277 --> 00:24:03,662
[SPEAKER_03]: I am wondering, just a point of clarification, are you talking about only the initial roll or every time the vote is called?

219
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the roll call to start the meeting.

220
00:24:06,744 --> 00:24:09,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, we keep saying roll call, but I do mean attendance.

221
00:24:10,707 --> 00:24:18,853
[SPEAKER_06]: The other voting stuff around matters is just far beyond what we have time for tonight.

222
00:24:19,013 --> 00:24:22,936
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we perhaps even need to include Howard in that conversation.

223
00:24:24,518 --> 00:24:26,879
[SPEAKER_06]: look to see have other communities done it, that kind of thing.

224
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,080
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is just for attendance.

225
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:40,905
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my mind, it would not be for adjournment either, because our meetings go too late and student reps hopefully are bailing at some point, honestly.

226
00:24:41,545 --> 00:24:41,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

227
00:24:41,885 --> 00:24:43,786
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

228
00:24:44,966 --> 00:24:52,009
[SPEAKER_06]: So what other, did member Graham or member VanDerKlood or others, frankly, did you have any other

229
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,963
[SPEAKER_06]: low-hanging fruit changes to the agenda that you think we should include?

230
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:58,524
[SPEAKER_06]: I have others, but I just want to hear from you.

231
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:02,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

232
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:13,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see us move the approval of bills, the transfer of funds, and the minutes for any school committee or committee of the whole meeting to the end of the agenda.

233
00:25:14,996 --> 00:25:15,376
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just

234
00:25:16,822 --> 00:25:19,124
[SPEAKER_04]: largely paperwork that has to get done.

235
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:26,970
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be happy to go to a consent agenda, but that might be too big of a change to enact quickly.

236
00:25:27,591 --> 00:25:36,378
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think those items in particular aren't items that I feel like the public is coming to listen to.

237
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:37,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the committee

238
00:25:38,757 --> 00:25:42,978
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes are different because we don't all attend all the committees.

239
00:25:43,058 --> 00:25:45,598
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's important to have those discussions.

240
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:52,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Those subcommittees are not as well attended even by the public.

241
00:25:52,620 --> 00:26:06,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would want to keep those at the front, but I would be interested in moving the rest to the back of the agenda so that I'm just really sensitive to all the people we make sit and wait for many, many, many hours.

242
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:12,567
[SPEAKER_04]: through stuff that is procedural.

243
00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:14,388
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

244
00:26:14,989 --> 00:26:23,475
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know that moving those items to a consent agenda item is, based on my memory of our last meeting with Ms.

245
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:28,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Presser from MASC, I didn't see anybody up in arms or thinking that was a weird thing.

246
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:34,863
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the only thing, if we were to do that, we'd have to introduce it and explain what it is.

247
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,642
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the language of a consent agenda doesn't even, like, what the heck does that even mean?

248
00:26:40,863 --> 00:26:50,926
[SPEAKER_06]: But I personally would support moving those items as a consent agenda item and to the end, which I never even thought of, but like, honestly.

249
00:26:52,647 --> 00:26:54,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Vander Kloot, you have thoughts on this?

250
00:26:55,988 --> 00:26:56,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I don't know.

251
00:26:56,968 --> 00:27:01,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always seen it as the warmup, but I can understand.

252
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:12,807
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've questioned about the report of the secretary because I think it's just something that's been on there forever.

253
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:24,200
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean, different people have handled it in different ways, but, you know, I don't know.

254
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:36,523
[SPEAKER_05]: So that, you know, if you can, I just don't know whether it makes sense if we were looking to take something out, but I'm not the secretary right now.

255
00:27:37,784 --> 00:27:49,047
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do know that when you're the secretary, I mean, Kathy used to go and she would highlight a particular bill or something, you know, which sometimes was interesting, but, you know,

256
00:27:49,990 --> 00:28:14,266
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, it's not that as secretary you get so many, I mean, it's a rare time that you would get a letter or something that went to you only, except now that we have the school committee, you know, letters, which come under community participation, so.

257
00:28:16,187 --> 00:28:17,988
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, I certainly,

258
00:28:19,242 --> 00:28:22,544
[SPEAKER_06]: would not argue against removing the item of report of secretary.

259
00:28:22,624 --> 00:28:34,790
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say, I mean, this is only my fourth year, but the vast majority of times, and even before that in the year that I watched school committee, there was just, there was no report.

260
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:45,175
[SPEAKER_06]: And what member Kretz did, I sometimes did find it interesting and maybe some of the public did as well.

261
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:48,437
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just wondering if there are other ways to accomplish that

262
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:57,403
[SPEAKER_06]: in the context of a school committee that meets longer than, frankly, almost any other school committee.

263
00:28:57,423 --> 00:29:08,627
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when I go to MASC and memorandum, you probably have a much better feel for this, but I go to the conference and I talk about meetings, we do have

264
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:13,163
[SPEAKER_06]: perhaps the longest school committee meeting of anybody I've talked to on a regular.

265
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:16,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Particularly in the recent times.

266
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:16,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

267
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:19,584
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you know, this has been extraordinary.

268
00:29:21,764 --> 00:29:35,207
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm fine with moving to remove the secretary's report and then, you know, we can add it back if it turns out it was useful.

269
00:29:35,895 --> 00:29:48,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the interesting thing is if the secretary is called on nowadays, he or she should be called on during community participation to say, are there any letters that have been sent in?

270
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:57,464
[SPEAKER_05]: So in some ways, the secretary's report should move and be part of community participation to highlight the outside letters.

271
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:00,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

272
00:30:01,105 --> 00:30:01,705
[SPEAKER_06]: I see what you're saying.

273
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:07,437
[SPEAKER_05]: And that piece sometimes, frankly, the mayor forgets.

274
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:13,058
[SPEAKER_05]: So it would be useful to have, it's a tweak, I think.

275
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's what we're trying to do.

276
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:16,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

277
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:33,222
[SPEAKER_06]: You just said something about community participation and that's on my short list of things I think is really important is that I think, well, I can't remember if we call it community participation or public participation, but I would prefer that the mayor at that item

278
00:30:34,005 --> 00:30:35,486
[SPEAKER_06]: always announces our policy.

279
00:30:36,547 --> 00:30:37,187
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not long.

280
00:30:37,947 --> 00:30:53,557
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've noticed in other school committees meetings that I've watched from other places that the chair, you know, sort of begins the public participation with this is how it works and this is how it will work.

281
00:30:54,137 --> 00:31:01,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of what I feel like happens sometimes with us is we get into it and suddenly somebody has been talking for 10 minutes and we're like,

282
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:03,259
[SPEAKER_06]: wait, what was the rule again?

283
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:16,010
[SPEAKER_06]: And if three or four people have already talked for a long time, it feels very unfair that suddenly we wanna enforce our rules after not having enforced our rules for the last three or four people have spoken.

284
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:22,655
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I think that just read the policy prior to public participation.

285
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:26,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And frankly, it might sound like it's more work, but it'll definitely save time in my opinion.

286
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:37,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I think, I think, in the description of you know what our policy is and what the rules are.

287
00:31:37,037 --> 00:31:39,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we also have a responsibility to

288
00:31:41,181 --> 00:31:47,302
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure the public understands the role of public comment in our meetings.

289
00:31:48,503 --> 00:31:54,544
[SPEAKER_04]: We often hear people, particularly when they disagree with us say, you haven't responded to me.

290
00:31:55,364 --> 00:32:10,448
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is, I think, sort of one of those places where you see the gap of like, there are times where we cannot respond because we would be in violation of the open meeting law for not having posted a topic.

291
00:32:11,788 --> 00:32:25,117
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there are some nuances in terms of like, what is the role of public comment and what is that there should really be no crosstalk right like that's that's not part of public comment under Roberts rules of order.

292
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:34,290
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's sort of a human expectation that when you ask a question, somebody's going to answer it.

293
00:32:35,331 --> 00:32:42,299
[SPEAKER_04]: I always want to answer questions, but I think we just need to be clear that

294
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:47,981
[SPEAKER_04]: if we're not answering a question, these are the reasons why that might happen.

295
00:32:48,502 --> 00:32:59,329
[SPEAKER_04]: So that we can start to, because that's where our meetings go wildly out of control, is when those kinds of situations come up.

296
00:32:59,469 --> 00:33:12,218
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we would all be best served to have a clear set of, identify what our policy is about how long you may speak, how often you may speak in a given meeting or topic or like,

297
00:33:12,438 --> 00:33:30,585
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, whatever the rules may be, you know, what you can and cannot do as part of your public comment and what, you know, what the committee cannot, can and cannot do in response so that we're just laying down the ground rules each and every time we have public comment.

298
00:33:32,426 --> 00:33:39,709
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's also some interesting, I think there's a lot of gyrations in the public discourse about,

299
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:44,949
[SPEAKER_04]: whether we must have public comment.

300
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:56,517
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's another sort of one of those places where Robert's rules, there's rules about that and the public sort of feels maybe differently about what those rules are.

301
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:00,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where our policies step in.

302
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:07,124
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just think it's important for us to be clear about what those things are because we need to have less,

303
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:17,234
[SPEAKER_04]: um, instances where our public comment sessions go completely off the rails, attack members, get out of control, hear from the same people 10 times.

304
00:34:17,634 --> 00:34:21,616
[SPEAKER_04]: We, we have to, we have to rein that in.

305
00:34:22,076 --> 00:34:28,579
[SPEAKER_04]: I am still really upset with what has been going on in our meetings and we can't continue to do it.

306
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

307
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:36,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, if, if the members are okay, um, I would, uh,

308
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:45,414
[SPEAKER_06]: suggest that the language that will end up on the agenda here, I think I can draft something and send it to the next RPE meeting.

309
00:34:46,355 --> 00:34:52,340
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you could approve something that I haven't even drafted to show up on the agenda to go to the full committee.

310
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,223
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that sounds reasonable, I'll draft that and put it on the next agenda.

311
00:34:58,485 --> 00:34:58,745
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

312
00:35:00,147 --> 00:35:02,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to keep us moving along, I have to have something to report out.

313
00:35:04,586 --> 00:35:08,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a motion to remove the secretary's report from the agenda?

314
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:18,769
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that the motion should be that the secretary's report be moved to under community participation.

315
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:29,951
[SPEAKER_06]: So just before it, like the item before it, or like community participation is the agenda item and then secretary's report is like the first bullet.

316
00:35:30,492 --> 00:35:32,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, a bullet underneath.

317
00:35:35,237 --> 00:35:35,417
[SPEAKER_06]: you.

318
00:35:35,537 --> 00:35:38,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent And, uh Susie, do you have that?

319
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:39,719
[SPEAKER_06]: Great Yes.

320
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:40,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

321
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,600
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, member Vander Kloot.

322
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

323
00:35:44,981 --> 00:35:45,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember Graham?

324
00:35:46,101 --> 00:35:46,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

325
00:35:46,942 --> 00:35:47,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember?

326
00:35:47,342 --> 00:35:49,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, three in the affirmative.

327
00:35:50,143 --> 00:35:51,843
[SPEAKER_06]: And um, that's good.

328
00:35:52,003 --> 00:35:52,624
[SPEAKER_06]: We have something to

329
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:09,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very, you didn't speak on your thoughts on the consent agenda concept.

330
00:36:11,717 --> 00:36:12,837
[SPEAKER_06]: You've approved more minutes.

331
00:36:14,118 --> 00:36:20,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I need you to just in a sentence or two, tell me exactly what you're saying when you say consent agenda.

332
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

333
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:26,941
[SPEAKER_06]: So I can't remember the exact wording that would appear on the agenda, our regular agenda.

334
00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:32,363
[SPEAKER_06]: It would perhaps say like consent, and then it would list

335
00:36:32,991 --> 00:36:39,233
[SPEAKER_06]: the minutes, the bills, the payrolls, and there would be one vote to approve them all, and that's it.

336
00:36:39,413 --> 00:36:47,356
[SPEAKER_06]: And any member could simply ask for a, I'm short of words today, sorry, whatever that is to break them out.

337
00:36:48,176 --> 00:36:51,817
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that you can do that for minutes.

338
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:56,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that there are certain ones that have to be called.

339
00:36:57,419 --> 00:37:00,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you have bills and payrolls, I think have to be,

340
00:37:03,328 --> 00:37:07,670
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to investigate that to find out whether that's true or not.

341
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:16,874
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's my, for the ones that we can, I'd certainly be, that would be okay with me, but we need to be clear which ones are which.

342
00:37:18,174 --> 00:37:26,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so if somebody could motion to move all of those options, those items that are allowed,

343
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:32,071
[SPEAKER_06]: to be part of the consent agenda, and I'll investigate what that is after the meeting.

344
00:37:32,672 --> 00:37:36,455
[SPEAKER_06]: And whatever those end up being is what we'll include.

345
00:37:37,216 --> 00:37:40,499
[SPEAKER_06]: So somebody can motion to combine those items.

346
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,079
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

347
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,483
[SPEAKER_06]: And do we also want to move it to the end of the meeting?

348
00:37:49,947 --> 00:37:50,588
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's fine.

349
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,029
[SPEAKER_06]: We can talk about it at the regular meeting.

350
00:37:56,725 --> 00:37:58,006
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally think it's fine.

351
00:37:59,387 --> 00:38:01,789
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably, I certainly get the warmup part.

352
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:11,916
[SPEAKER_06]: And when I think about a brand new member, their first meeting, but I'm not sure there's really warming up for a brand new member in the first meeting.

353
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:13,197
[SPEAKER_06]: It's terribly stressful.

354
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:16,360
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure I remember it being so.

355
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:23,745
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to mention, I'm looking at a couple of agendas now and consent agendas do include warrants.

356
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:24,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

357
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:28,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

358
00:38:29,346 --> 00:38:36,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So why don't we... Member Graham, what are you looking at?

359
00:38:37,109 --> 00:38:42,051
[SPEAKER_04]: I am looking at agendas from other communities.

360
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:45,352
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you share those with me?

361
00:38:47,513 --> 00:38:48,573
[SPEAKER_04]: You want me just to send you a link?

362
00:38:49,174 --> 00:38:49,354
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

363
00:38:49,854 --> 00:38:52,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, sure.

364
00:38:52,735 --> 00:38:55,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll look at it later, but I'd like to see it.

365
00:38:56,148 --> 00:38:58,609
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you found one that has it, that'd be great.

366
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:14,412
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion to combine all items that we are allowed to into a consent agenda item to be moved to the end of the agenda prior to the condolences.

367
00:39:15,813 --> 00:39:15,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

368
00:39:17,533 --> 00:39:20,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham, are you going to second that?

369
00:39:20,674 --> 00:39:20,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

370
00:39:21,434 --> 00:39:21,774
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

371
00:39:22,634 --> 00:39:23,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van de Kloot.

372
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:24,615
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

373
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:25,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

374
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:26,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

375
00:39:27,555 --> 00:39:28,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rousseau, yes.

376
00:39:28,676 --> 00:39:29,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Three in the affirmative.

377
00:39:30,196 --> 00:39:30,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

378
00:39:32,597 --> 00:39:43,541
[SPEAKER_06]: The attendance, do we want to, you know, I don't really know that typically subcommittees don't send things up not with a recommendation.

379
00:39:46,262 --> 00:39:54,625
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, I know that I would like to send a recommendation up that the attendance be performed in sort of the format I described earlier.

380
00:39:55,123 --> 00:39:59,666
[SPEAKER_06]: that the student reps are added to the attendance item.

381
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:04,389
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, Member Van Der Koolen, I think we can talk about it.

382
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:08,952
[SPEAKER_06]: I suspect this will be a conversation point in the regular meeting.

383
00:40:11,733 --> 00:40:14,935
[SPEAKER_06]: So would you be okay with moving that forward?

384
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can move it forward.

385
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:18,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

386
00:40:18,277 --> 00:40:21,619
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to think about it a little more, but we certainly can move it forward to the main meeting.

387
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, and is there a second?

388
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:25,462
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

389
00:40:26,422 --> 00:40:27,143
[SPEAKER_06]: I wonder who it could be.

390
00:40:28,403 --> 00:40:29,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Vander Kloot?

391
00:40:29,784 --> 00:40:30,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

392
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:31,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

393
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:32,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

394
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:34,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Rossell, yes.

395
00:40:34,146 --> 00:40:35,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Three in the affirmative.

396
00:40:35,586 --> 00:40:44,630
[SPEAKER_06]: The addition of the student representatives will be added to the attendance of the regular school committee, or at least that's what we're gonna suggest.

397
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:49,692
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we should do more stuff right now.

398
00:40:49,732 --> 00:40:52,473
[SPEAKER_06]: We have these other policies, unless there was something else important.

399
00:40:53,851 --> 00:40:57,973
[SPEAKER_06]: that the two of you thought we needed to really work on tonight around the agenda?

400
00:40:59,353 --> 00:40:59,533
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

401
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:00,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

402
00:41:01,194 --> 00:41:10,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me flip back to... Okay, members of the council and Graham, unfortunately at this point I need to leave.

403
00:41:13,158 --> 00:41:14,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

404
00:41:14,159 --> 00:41:15,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, take care.

405
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:16,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye-bye everybody.

406
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good night, bye-bye.

407
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:21,782
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so,

408
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:24,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have three policies.

409
00:41:24,646 --> 00:41:25,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we can do it.

410
00:41:27,247 --> 00:41:43,152
[SPEAKER_06]: So the policy on harassment, ACAB, I believe it is... I wanna share it once I find it.

411
00:41:44,273 --> 00:41:46,473
[SPEAKER_04]: While you do that, can I ask Mr. Murphy a question?

412
00:41:46,493 --> 00:41:48,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

413
00:41:50,157 --> 00:42:07,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I have noticed this in a couple places, but I always am a little surprised that employee to student harassment is defined solely in the confines of conditions of participation in programs or the basis for decisions affecting students or grades like

414
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:16,311
[SPEAKER_04]: you can simply harass another human without intending to affect their grade or their ability to get on a sports team.

415
00:42:16,331 --> 00:42:22,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And that never seems to like be on the list of the definition of employee to student harassment.

416
00:42:23,013 --> 00:42:24,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a reason for, is there a legal reason for that?

417
00:42:24,913 --> 00:42:27,053
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's what I can think of really.

418
00:42:27,073 --> 00:42:35,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that there are laws governing participation in sports and

419
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:42,437
[SPEAKER_00]: that requires sort of like an affirmative recitation of those laws.

420
00:42:42,958 --> 00:42:49,562
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that if the question is whether there should be a general prohibition on harassment, I think clearly the answer would be yes.

421
00:42:50,382 --> 00:43:04,271
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only basis to not somehow memorialize that would be whenever you memorialize something, you run the risk that there's something that is arguably not encompassed by

422
00:43:05,178 --> 00:43:06,699
[SPEAKER_00]: the memorialization of it.

423
00:43:06,899 --> 00:43:09,021
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that could be a reason.

424
00:43:09,101 --> 00:43:21,590
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a reason that it sometimes is given as to why to not have a sort of very broad policy on or an attempt to have a broad policy on employee conduct.

425
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:33,298
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you define it, you're by definition excluding some type of facts that you could at a future date want to argue are encompassed by it.

426
00:43:34,343 --> 00:43:37,365
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the only thing I can really think of as to why we wouldn't necessarily have that.

427
00:43:37,686 --> 00:43:47,333
[SPEAKER_00]: We certainly would hold staff accountable if there was an example of harassment.

428
00:43:47,473 --> 00:43:48,334
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not uncommon.

429
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:51,296
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I'll just say just as an example.

430
00:43:51,937 --> 00:43:55,319
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't give that example, sorry.

431
00:43:55,379 --> 00:44:03,946
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are examples in which sometimes we have situations in which students are being subjected to inappropriate

432
00:44:05,005 --> 00:44:07,228
[SPEAKER_00]: communications or so on and so forth.

433
00:44:07,268 --> 00:44:10,833
[SPEAKER_00]: So it definitely happens and we definitely respond to it.

434
00:44:12,575 --> 00:44:12,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

435
00:44:12,956 --> 00:44:15,319
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess, like, I've seen this a couple times.

436
00:44:15,379 --> 00:44:17,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think the paperwork that I signed when I onboarded, I was like,

437
00:44:18,977 --> 00:44:31,964
[SPEAKER_04]: This feels like really incomplete, but the bullet under student-to-student harassment, such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with a student's performance or creating an intimidating or hostile learning environment.

438
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:38,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Seems like it should also be added under the employee-to-student harassment component.

439
00:44:38,868 --> 00:44:40,449
[SPEAKER_00]: I disagree.

440
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:42,610
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

441
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,592
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not a lawyer, but when I read that,

442
00:44:47,556 --> 00:44:49,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally understand where you're going, Member Graham.

443
00:44:50,557 --> 00:45:09,363
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what's different here is that, well, I think Mr. Murphy sort of pointed this out, like the general laws that we're all subjected to aren't all iterated throughout all of our policies, but these are really very specific to the setting.

444
00:45:11,604 --> 00:45:16,005
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, I mean, do we even have employee to employee harassment listed at all?

445
00:45:18,033 --> 00:45:19,934
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see it at all.

446
00:45:20,174 --> 00:45:21,855
[SPEAKER_06]: And that of course is a real thing as well.

447
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:23,716
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure happens.

448
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:45,845
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I guess that sort of gets to the point of when we start including more what we're excluding, it's sort of like everybody's always trying to interpret Supreme Court justices and what they thought or what the Congress thought when they passed the law and what they do say and what they don't say.

449
00:45:46,683 --> 00:45:47,443
[SPEAKER_06]: matters greatly.

450
00:45:49,184 --> 00:45:58,988
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyways, so I'm gonna just share, if you don't mind, actually, I'm gonna skip to the easy, quick policy, the student conduct, the staff conduct policy.

451
00:45:59,028 --> 00:46:01,149
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't mean that it's easy, I just mean it's short.

452
00:46:02,749 --> 00:46:03,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Who can share?

453
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:08,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Why am I getting settings?

454
00:46:08,872 --> 00:46:09,172
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

455
00:46:11,032 --> 00:46:11,513
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

456
00:46:12,073 --> 00:46:13,733
[SPEAKER_06]: I have many screens.

457
00:46:14,514 --> 00:46:14,894
[SPEAKER_06]: There it is.

458
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:29,944
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so this is the recommended policy and I, assuming anybody that, Ms.

459
00:46:29,964 --> 00:46:35,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Weiss, was this included in the, for the public to be able to see this in the posting?

460
00:46:37,646 --> 00:46:38,846
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it wasn't in the posting.

461
00:46:39,086 --> 00:46:41,887
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the folder for this meeting.

462
00:46:42,547 --> 00:46:43,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great, thank you.

463
00:46:44,547 --> 00:46:48,248
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not, this particular policy will,

464
00:46:49,289 --> 00:46:53,392
[SPEAKER_06]: it'll be in the regular school committee files when that gets posted.

465
00:46:53,552 --> 00:46:59,796
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, if anybody in the public joined and wanted to talk about this, this would be the first time they're seeing it.

466
00:46:59,936 --> 00:47:06,481
[SPEAKER_06]: But is there any particular comments or concerns about how this is worded?

467
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:08,902
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any.

468
00:47:10,884 --> 00:47:11,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

469
00:47:11,384 --> 00:47:15,367
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I have to admit a complete lack of ignorance on how

470
00:47:15,858 --> 00:47:16,558
[SPEAKER_06]: to approve the motion to approve.

471
00:47:16,578 --> 00:47:18,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Robert's rules handles to members and seconding.

472
00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:21,279
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's very motion to approve motion to approve.

473
00:47:22,219 --> 00:47:25,620
[SPEAKER_06]: And I guess I'll second that, um, member Graham.

474
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes member.

475
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,621
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes, and member.

476
00:47:29,641 --> 00:47:31,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh band recruit is absent.

477
00:47:32,521 --> 00:47:34,622
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, to in the affirmative.

478
00:47:34,762 --> 00:47:37,482
[SPEAKER_06]: This will be sent up to the full committee for approval.

479
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:38,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe on

480
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:01,135
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop share.

481
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:01,835
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

482
00:48:03,355 --> 00:48:08,597
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so let me switch to the other item.

483
00:48:11,678 --> 00:48:14,238
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me share the harassment policy.

484
00:48:21,641 --> 00:48:23,061
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe

485
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:27,975
[SPEAKER_06]: member Graham, there was a sentence you wanted to include in the section above.

486
00:48:28,035 --> 00:48:28,995
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it this one?

487
00:48:29,355 --> 00:48:30,276
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yep.

488
00:48:32,438 --> 00:48:35,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Cushing, did you have... I'll wait, I'll wait.

489
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:35,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

490
00:48:40,443 --> 00:48:45,847
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the, I don't know if the name of this policy is

491
00:48:49,036 --> 00:48:52,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I know our attorney recommended this policy to us.

492
00:48:54,199 --> 00:49:08,128
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this really speaks to, it seems like it speaks more to student harassment than it does to like, as you mentioned, like employee to employee harassment.

493
00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:15,092
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't know if the title needed to change or something else.

494
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:17,574
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can call it anything we want.

495
00:49:17,634 --> 00:49:26,659
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an MASC policy that, you know, recommended policy, but of course we can change anything we want.

496
00:49:28,821 --> 00:49:32,103
[SPEAKER_06]: Harassment involving students.

497
00:49:35,264 --> 00:49:38,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wasn't, if it was, did.

498
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:44,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham, you're, you broke up there.

499
00:49:45,103 --> 00:49:59,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't sure if it was intended to be limited or like, is the intent to receive that limited to students or the intent on harassment?

500
00:50:01,229 --> 00:50:06,511
[SPEAKER_06]: You are breaking up quite a lot, but I think we got what you were saying about the intent.

501
00:50:09,152 --> 00:50:13,154
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would hope, I would like to hear perhaps from administrators

502
00:50:13,584 --> 00:50:16,565
[SPEAKER_06]: know this policy since I am new to this policy.

503
00:50:18,426 --> 00:50:21,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Cushing, do you happen to have familiarity with it?

504
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:29,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, but unfortunately on my end, Member Graham broke up more so that I couldn't pick up the gist.

505
00:50:30,849 --> 00:50:32,530
[SPEAKER_06]: She was asking, but yes.

506
00:50:33,403 --> 00:50:44,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sorry, I was asking whether this policy was specifically governing student harassment or if this is our one and only policy on harassment.

507
00:50:45,994 --> 00:50:51,977
[SPEAKER_02]: So generally speaking, this is the encompassing policy on harassment.

508
00:50:53,258 --> 00:51:06,324
[SPEAKER_02]: I can verify with MASC to see if there is anything else that may not have been previously included in our policy handbook for whatever possible reason.

509
00:51:07,785 --> 00:51:17,997
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would say my suggestion that I had raised my hand for was to recommend this as a first reading because these are pretty consequential policies.

510
00:51:18,037 --> 00:51:22,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all policies are, but these are very consequential.

511
00:51:23,022 --> 00:51:40,516
[SPEAKER_02]: and to do a first reading so that everybody kind of knows that this is on the radar and see if there are suggestions, kind of like the one you just made, about employee to employee or various things along those lines that we can vet and really research.

512
00:51:41,657 --> 00:51:49,023
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is primarily the employee to student, student to student, and then sexual harassment as well.

513
00:51:50,423 --> 00:51:56,544
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did just check the MASC policy service to see other harassment policies.

514
00:51:56,625 --> 00:52:04,326
[SPEAKER_06]: And in fact, there is no, there's a bullying prevention policy, of course, that has the word reference, references the word harassment.

515
00:52:04,346 --> 00:52:15,269
[SPEAKER_06]: There is nothing else in there actually, which I do find interesting and would make me want to seek guidance from our attorney to find out, you know, is the absence of

516
00:52:16,184 --> 00:52:23,626
[SPEAKER_06]: anything related to employees, is there a good reason that we don't have something?

517
00:52:25,166 --> 00:52:39,949
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I just think about like employee to employee to me may in fact incur conversations with the unions or, you know, why is it that even our association has nothing?

518
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:44,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

519
00:52:47,528 --> 00:52:51,909
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mr. Cushing, your point about the first and second reading.

520
00:52:52,450 --> 00:53:00,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am drafting a new set of rules for the school committee kind of cobbling together bits I can find from all over the place of our current rules.

521
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:09,755
[SPEAKER_06]: And the addition of second readings of policies is something that I have in there, but that is not currently part of our policies.

522
00:53:10,835 --> 00:53:16,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there is any reason we couldn't bring it to the school committee and then

523
00:53:17,512 --> 00:53:34,535
[SPEAKER_06]: discuss and then one of us could motion to table it to the next meeting, effectively creating a second reading, but that is not currently part of the rules of the school committee.

524
00:53:34,575 --> 00:53:43,217
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and I, yeah, this is such a consequential policy that just like surprise, here you go.

525
00:53:43,257 --> 00:53:44,537
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's over within five minutes.

526
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:47,038
[SPEAKER_06]: I could see that upsetting people.

527
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:48,973
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

528
00:53:49,113 --> 00:54:05,802
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, I would like to make a motion that we move this forward as amended, but I also would be happy to motion to table it so that we can create a second reading of this policy.

529
00:54:08,023 --> 00:54:08,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

530
00:54:08,443 --> 00:54:10,565
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll do that at the regular meeting, the table.

531
00:54:10,585 --> 00:54:10,905
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

532
00:54:11,285 --> 00:54:11,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

533
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:12,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

534
00:54:13,566 --> 00:54:17,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Were there any other comments on the language that's in here?

535
00:54:18,478 --> 00:54:30,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I only read it through once and, you know, nothing got me very, too excited or interested with problems or anything.

536
00:54:31,124 --> 00:54:35,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion to move this to the full committee, member Graham.

537
00:54:36,327 --> 00:54:36,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

538
00:54:37,707 --> 00:54:39,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo, yes to in the affirmative.

539
00:54:40,589 --> 00:54:42,350
[SPEAKER_06]: We will send this policy as amended

540
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:55,030
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wise, I did add the language to the Google Doc, the change that we just discussed, and I'm not sure if you're using my version or document management, it's a whole different conversation for another day.

541
00:54:57,070 --> 00:55:01,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, and then we have four minutes, what's left?

542
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:12,053
[SPEAKER_06]: So this last one, which is number three on the agenda, Review the Grievance Procedure for Complaints of Sexual Harassment under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972.

543
00:55:14,056 --> 00:55:20,881
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got to stop sharing so I can grab that.

544
00:55:26,686 --> 00:55:34,352
[SPEAKER_04]: And while you pull that up, on page one, there is a reference to an assistant superintendent with some question marks.

545
00:55:34,512 --> 00:55:40,036
[SPEAKER_04]: And one question I had is, who is this designated Title IX coordinator for Medford?

546
00:55:40,457 --> 00:55:42,618
[SPEAKER_02]: For Medford is Director of Pupil Services.

547
00:55:42,638 --> 00:55:43,459
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

548
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:48,537
[SPEAKER_02]: It varies from district to district.

549
00:55:49,178 --> 00:55:51,259
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also suggest just given the time.

550
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:57,564
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you will, a brief, quick history of Title IX.

551
00:55:57,584 --> 00:56:04,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Title IX changed substantially at the start of this academic year.

552
00:56:04,449 --> 00:56:13,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you may have heard that the current president is looking into some of the statutory changes

553
00:56:13,936 --> 00:56:32,700
[SPEAKER_02]: that were made by the previous president that make Title IX allegations substantially more challenging on the part of the person who is submitting it.

554
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:34,560
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ms.

555
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:41,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowen might be able to help support me here, but the rules change substantially.

556
00:56:42,841 --> 00:56:52,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would just suggest that we offer members the opportunity to do some research on it, to really fully understand.

557
00:56:52,548 --> 00:56:58,974
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had our administrators go through two, I believe, two separate trainings this year, Ms.

558
00:56:58,994 --> 00:57:08,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowen, and just around the real challenges that the new Title IX really provides.

559
00:57:09,862 --> 00:57:10,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

560
00:57:10,303 --> 00:57:10,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

561
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:11,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Two trainings.

562
00:57:13,017 --> 00:57:13,377
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

563
00:57:13,677 --> 00:57:20,439
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do remember when this change came out, it was quite the news story for quite a while, frankly.

564
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:23,819
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember going like, holy crap, I hope we don't have to do that here.

565
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:27,620
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, that was my ignorance, because we don't have a choice.

566
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:36,902
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the update to get us in compliance with the policy change that occurred in the former administration.

567
00:57:37,282 --> 00:57:37,562
[SPEAKER_06]: So I

568
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:43,846
[SPEAKER_06]: we probably should have invited Howard to this meeting.

569
00:57:45,467 --> 00:58:00,998
[SPEAKER_06]: So failure to update the policy to comply with the new Title IX, is that a law or a regulation, whatever it is, doesn't in any way, shape or form change what Title IX is.

570
00:58:01,918 --> 00:58:07,602
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can decide to follow a different procedure that's not legal.

571
00:58:08,882 --> 00:58:11,764
[SPEAKER_06]: and we would just lose if that gets brought up.

572
00:58:11,784 --> 00:58:24,595
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess my point is it's like, so we're gonna make, it sounds like staff is already going through training to get in compliance with this new stuff that I personally think is just awful.

573
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:31,100
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we will approve all this stuff.

574
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,064
[SPEAKER_06]: And then title nine, these things will all get changed again, hopefully very soon.

575
00:58:37,407 --> 00:58:49,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Will you have to go through, we'll have to change the policy yet again, which is fine, but will you all have to go through yet again more training or is the hope that you'll just go back to doing things the way you had been doing them?

576
00:58:53,088 --> 00:58:59,371
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it depends on what the differences are from the last change to this change.

577
00:59:00,051 --> 00:59:10,876
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some steps in the investigation and the decision-making that are new to the process that are somewhat concerning, but there are steps that we need to follow.

578
00:59:11,776 --> 00:59:16,658
[SPEAKER_01]: So those would have to be changed depending on what changes were to be made with the new

579
00:59:19,079 --> 00:59:21,701
[SPEAKER_01]: with the president and what they're looking at that sort of thing.

580
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:31,508
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot in here that is different, but I think we have to follow this process until the changes are officially made.

581
00:59:36,438 --> 00:59:37,679
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

582
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:38,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

583
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:53,409
[SPEAKER_02]: My question would be, given the time, would you feel comfortable tabling this and seeing if Mr. Greenspan or someone else is available at our next rules policy equity meeting to go into those nuances?

584
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:55,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like that.

585
00:59:55,830 --> 01:00:01,674
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would also just ask, can we get the current

586
01:00:02,779 --> 01:00:03,680
[SPEAKER_06]: grievance procedure.

587
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:10,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't, when I searched in our policy manual, I didn't see it, but that doesn't belong in the policy manual.

588
01:00:10,205 --> 01:00:11,286
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course I didn't see it.

589
01:00:12,106 --> 01:00:22,834
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would like to know that the current procedure we have that this will replace, was that one like super outdated and not really what we were doing anyways.

590
01:00:23,335 --> 01:00:32,602
[SPEAKER_06]: So going, even if we were just like to roll back what this brings forward, what we've rolled back to, would that have been where we should be going?

591
01:00:33,371 --> 01:00:43,794
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I think it would be good to have that, um, if somebody could find, you have to execute on this procedure, uh, the current one as well as this new one.

592
01:00:44,334 --> 01:00:47,935
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so you must have it somewhere, but I don't think I have seen it.

593
01:00:48,015 --> 01:01:00,638
[SPEAKER_06]: So, um, is there a motion to move this to the next agenda meeting and invite, uh, Mr. Greenspan or, um, if he indicates that this is not his wheelhouse, I know that, you know, lawyers do specialize, um,

594
01:01:01,797 --> 01:01:09,879
[SPEAKER_06]: So if he cannot speak to this topic specifically, if we could invite somebody, I don't know who we use, Merrick.

595
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:14,440
[SPEAKER_00]: We can work with Howard to make sure that we have the appropriate counsel.

596
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:17,740
[SPEAKER_00]: That won't be a problem.

597
01:01:19,221 --> 01:01:19,561
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

598
01:01:19,581 --> 01:01:21,381
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be totally honest, I saw this very briefly.

599
01:01:21,401 --> 01:01:30,263
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't had a chance to fully even digest this myself or sort of see how it compares to the human resources practices that we have currently in our office.

600
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:46,167
[SPEAKER_00]: it as hugely problematic at the moment, but I'd like a little bit of, and it sounds like there will be, I'd like to talk to Howard briefly about this, and we can make sure that we're prepared at the next meeting to speak to the implications of it.

601
01:01:47,388 --> 01:01:49,109
[SPEAKER_04]: So motion to table for the next meeting.

602
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:53,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, and I'll second it, I guess.

603
01:01:54,031 --> 01:01:54,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham.

604
01:01:55,432 --> 01:01:55,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

605
01:01:56,732 --> 01:01:57,073
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

606
01:01:57,093 --> 01:01:57,933
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Russo, yes.

607
01:01:58,613 --> 01:01:59,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

608
01:02:00,014 --> 01:02:01,055
[SPEAKER_06]: So two in the affirmative.

609
01:02:02,102 --> 01:02:07,792
[SPEAKER_06]: this new procedure is moved to the next RPE meeting, those policy and equity meeting.

610
01:02:09,496 --> 01:02:10,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, everybody, for coming tonight.

611
01:02:10,998 --> 01:02:12,261
[SPEAKER_06]: I do appreciate it.

612
01:02:12,922 --> 01:02:16,408
[SPEAKER_06]: We're doing good on keeping these meetings almost on time.

613
01:02:18,733 --> 01:02:19,955
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never been known for that.

614
01:02:20,015 --> 01:02:21,778
[SPEAKER_06]: So is there a motion to adjourn?

615
01:02:22,459 --> 01:02:23,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to adjourn.

616
01:02:24,343 --> 01:02:25,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll second that.

617
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:25,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Graham?

618
01:02:26,487 --> 01:02:26,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

619
01:02:27,509 --> 01:02:28,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Members, no yes.

620
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:29,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Two in the affirmative.
