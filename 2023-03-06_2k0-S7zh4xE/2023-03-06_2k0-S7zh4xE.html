    <p>[yrx76KKBXT8_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=329.164s">Little</a>  person to touch the little person just not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=334.046s">There</a>  you go. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=335.227s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=425.848s">For</a>  implementation and programming, we have four different programs through Sandy Hook Promise at Medford Public Schools currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=432.491s">We</a>  have Start With Hello, Say Something, Signs of Suicide, and then the Say Something Anonymous reporting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=439.914s">I'm</a>  gonna walk you through some of the other programming so you have a comprehensive view of what we are implementing currently. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=447.277s">Start</a>  With Hello was implemented in the fall of 2019. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=449.838s">There</a>  is an annual presentation each fall for students. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=455.455s">The</a>  goals of this program is to understand the concepts of loneliness and social isolation, and to learn how to create a socially inclusive school community that combats loneliness and social isolation. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=467.306s">There</a>  are three simple steps to start with hello, which is you see someone alone, you reach out to help, and you quite simply start with hello. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=481.394s">The</a>  next program, which was piloted in the spring of 2019 and implemented in the spring of 2022, is the signs of suicide. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=490.061s">That</a>  follows the ACT protocol to acknowledge, care, and tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=495.705s">There</a>  are three steps for ACT, which is, again, the acknowledge, care, and tell, and it is to talk about depression as a serious mental health condition that requires treatment for some people. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=508.65s">And</a>  if you're worried about yourself or a friend to act and that we are talking about how help is always available as part of all of the programs, they talk about the trusted adults, identifying trusted adults at the school, the supports we have for counseling within the school, as well as crisis center hotlines or calling 911 if that is something that falls in that category. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=535.353s">The</a>  Say Something program, the Attorney General's Office, which originally connected us again as one of the 50 districts in Massachusetts in 2019 for Say Something, for Cindy Hook Promise, rolled out the Say Something programming in fall of 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=549.901s">After</a>  some training, we implemented this in the spring of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=554.624s">It</a>  has three different steps, which is to recognize signs of <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=559.648s">signs</a>  and threats regarding student well-being and welfare, to act immediately and take it seriously, and to say something, both to a trusted adult. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=568.072s">And</a>  again, all of these programs review trusted adults within the building, making sure students identify a trusted adult, and talking about counseling services that are available in and out of school. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=581.76s">The</a>  Say Something Anonymous reporting system was officially implemented in January of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=586.062s">This</a>  took one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=588.922s">of</a>  coordination and training with Sandy Hook Promise because the program is very involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=596.606s">The</a>  training pattern was the administration was trained on the system in December of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=602.828s">Medford</a>  911 dispatch was trained both in December and in January 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=606.87s">And</a>  all faculty and students at the secondary level, the programming is for six through 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=613.885s">were</a>  trained in January 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=616.412s">So</a>  what exactly is the anonymous reporting system? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=621.334s">It</a>  is, again, another three-step process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=623.755s">The</a>  first is that there are three different ways to send in an anonymous tip. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=630.136s">If</a>  you feel like there is something in your school community that you are concerned about, you can call the hotline, you can use the website, you can use the mobile app. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=641.019s">In</a>  step two, all calls and tips are sent through the Sandy Hook Promise crisis line. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=648.448s">and</a>  a Councilor immediately connects with you, whether that's through text or whether that's through the phone and they have multilingual abilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=657.497s">And</a>  step three, that tip either is diverted to a school-based team, a district-wide team, or Bedford 911, depending on what that tip is when it comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=671.38s">So</a>  again, a crisis Councilor reviews all the tips with a private chat. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=676.303s">It's</a>  anonymous and they answer follow up questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=680.687s">And</a>  if they provide them with a specific number for the tip. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=684.069s">So</a>  if there's any information later, the anonymous tipster can go back to that tip. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=689.295s">The</a>  anonymous reporting button is on our website under the high school and the secondary schools, as well as additional information regarding the say something process. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=699.942s">So</a>  the anonymous report button is at the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=703.885s">And</a>  then if you go under student services, there is a section that says say something anonymous reporting system. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=710.629s">If</a>  you click on that, it provides you with more information regarding the tip line and a direct link to submit a tip. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=719.615s">again,</a>  from that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=722.357s">Some</a>  of the common reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=725.138s">This</a>  is from Sandy Hook promises database. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=727.579s">This</a>  is not necessarily from our tips regarding acts of violence, verbal harassment, sexual abuse, threats seen on social media, bullying, bragging about weapons, depression, anxiety, mental health, hopelessness, reckless behavior, social isolation, substance or alcohol abuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=747.785s">suicide</a>  threats, cutting yourself harm, and any other troubling situations or behaviors. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=755.447s">So</a>  how is it going for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=757.527s">Tips</a>  are coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=758.667s">Administrators</a>  and Councilors work on tips in coordination with Medford Police. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=763.528s">We</a>  have received a bunch of tips so far after rolling this out two months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=767.729s">Our</a>  agreement with Sandy Hook Promise prevents us from disclosing the number of tips or the nature of tips. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=773.1s">We</a>  work with our team to manage these tips as they come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=776.082s">And</a>  again, with coordination with Medford police as there's needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=781.404s">And</a>  where we are going, Sandy Hook promise programming is now provided at no cost in perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=790.369s">So</a>  that was the concern when we started bringing on the anonymous tip line because it is so complex in terms of training and takes quite a bit of planning to implement it. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=803.171s">that</a>  we wanted to make sure this was going to be sustainable. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=805.572s">And</a>  again, it is no cost in the future for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=808.513s">So</a>  we'll be able to continue with this programming if it's successful.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=813.296s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=813.676s">Schulman.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=814.356s">Member</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[jIaWTlmnQkA_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=815.436s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=816.437s">Schulman,</a>  for that report. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=818.698s">I</a>  just had a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=824.781s">How</a>  are the students informed of this process in terms of the start with hello, the say something, <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=833.403s">in</a>  the system, how are they trained?</p>

    <p>[Schulman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=836.204s">So</a>  there is an annual presentation on say something and start with hello every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=842.646s">And</a>  that is usually through the advisory or the wind blocks.</p>

    <p>[jIaWTlmnQkA_SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=846.628s">Do</a>  you know if it's differentiated or interpreted at all? <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=850.469s">It</a>  is interpreted, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/2k0-S7zh4xE&t=853.01s">And</a>  differentiated?</p>
