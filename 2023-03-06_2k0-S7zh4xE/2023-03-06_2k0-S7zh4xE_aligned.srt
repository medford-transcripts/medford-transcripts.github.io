1
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:06,349
Thank you.

2
00:04:10,526 --> 00:04:10,933
Thank you.

3
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:31,625
Little person to touch the little person just not working.

4
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:34,386
There you go.

5
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:35,807
Thank you very much.

6
00:07:05,848 --> 00:07:12,291
For implementation and programming, we have four different programs through Sandy Hook Promise at Medford Public Schools currently.

7
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:19,414
We have Start With Hello, Say Something, Signs of Suicide, and then the Say Something Anonymous reporting system.

8
00:07:19,914 --> 00:07:26,157
I'm gonna walk you through some of the other programming so you have a comprehensive view of what we are implementing currently.

9
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:29,738
Start With Hello was implemented in the fall of 2019.

10
00:07:29,838 --> 00:07:33,520
There is an annual presentation each fall for students.

11
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:46,065
The goals of this program is to understand the concepts of loneliness and social isolation, and to learn how to create a socially inclusive school community that combats loneliness and social isolation.

12
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:55,574
There are three simple steps to start with hello, which is you see someone alone, you reach out to help, and you quite simply start with hello.

13
00:08:01,394 --> 00:08:09,921
The next program, which was piloted in the spring of 2019 and implemented in the spring of 2022, is the signs of suicide.

14
00:08:10,061 --> 00:08:14,144
That follows the ACT protocol to acknowledge, care, and tell.

15
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:27,394
There are three steps for ACT, which is, again, the acknowledge, care, and tell, and it is to talk about depression as a serious mental health condition that requires treatment for some people.

16
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:54,155
And if you're worried about yourself or a friend to act and that we are talking about how help is always available as part of all of the programs, they talk about the trusted adults, identifying trusted adults at the school, the supports we have for counseling within the school, as well as crisis center hotlines or calling 911 if that is something that falls in that category.

17
00:08:55,353 --> 00:09:08,740
The Say Something program, the Attorney General's Office, which originally connected us again as one of the 50 districts in Massachusetts in 2019 for Say Something, for Cindy Hook Promise, rolled out the Say Something programming in fall of 2021.

18
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:14,123
After some training, we implemented this in the spring of 2022.

19
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:18,566
It has three different steps, which is to recognize signs of

20
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:27,932
signs and threats regarding student well-being and welfare, to act immediately and take it seriously, and to say something, both to a trusted adult.

21
00:09:28,072 --> 00:09:38,518
And again, all of these programs review trusted adults within the building, making sure students identify a trusted adult, and talking about counseling services that are available in and out of school.

22
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,982
The Say Something Anonymous reporting system was officially implemented in January of 2023.

23
00:09:46,062 --> 00:09:46,622
This took one year.

24
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:53,644
of coordination and training with Sandy Hook Promise because the program is very involved.

25
00:09:56,606 --> 00:10:02,668
The training pattern was the administration was trained on the system in December of 2022.

26
00:10:02,828 --> 00:10:06,710
Medford 911 dispatch was trained both in December and in January 2022.

27
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:13,053
And all faculty and students at the secondary level, the programming is for six through 12.

28
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:15,148
were trained in January 2023.

29
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:19,119
So what exactly is the anonymous reporting system?

30
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:23,635
It is, again, another three-step process.

31
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:29,856
The first is that there are three different ways to send in an anonymous tip.

32
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:40,179
If you feel like there is something in your school community that you are concerned about, you can call the hotline, you can use the website, you can use the mobile app.

33
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:47,861
In step two, all calls and tips are sent through the Sandy Hook Promise crisis line.

34
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:56,676
and a counselor immediately connects with you, whether that's through text or whether that's through the phone and they have multilingual abilities.

35
00:10:57,497 --> 00:11:07,968
And step three, that tip either is diverted to a school-based team, a district-wide team, or Bedford 911, depending on what that tip is when it comes in.

36
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,963
So again, a crisis counselor reviews all the tips with a private chat.

37
00:11:16,303 --> 00:11:19,165
It's anonymous and they answer follow up questions.

38
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:24,049
And if they provide them with a specific number for the tip.

39
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:28,312
So if there's any information later, the anonymous tipster can go back to that tip.

40
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:39,882
The anonymous reporting button is on our website under the high school and the secondary schools, as well as additional information regarding the say something process.

41
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:43,004
So the anonymous report button is at the top.

42
00:11:43,885 --> 00:11:50,429
And then if you go under student services, there is a section that says say something anonymous reporting system.

43
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:59,215
If you click on that, it provides you with more information regarding the tip line and a direct link to submit a tip.

44
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,636
again, from that site.

45
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:03,717
Some of the common reports.

46
00:12:05,138 --> 00:12:07,559
This is from Sandy Hook promises database.

47
00:12:07,579 --> 00:12:27,249
This is not necessarily from our tips regarding acts of violence, verbal harassment, sexual abuse, threats seen on social media, bullying, bragging about weapons, depression, anxiety, mental health, hopelessness, reckless behavior, social isolation, substance or alcohol abuse.

48
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:32,706
suicide threats, cutting yourself harm, and any other troubling situations or behaviors.

49
00:12:35,447 --> 00:12:36,567
So how is it going for us?

50
00:12:37,527 --> 00:12:38,347
Tips are coming in.

51
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:42,888
Administrators and counselors work on tips in coordination with Medford Police.

52
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:47,089
We have received a bunch of tips so far after rolling this out two months ago.

53
00:12:47,729 --> 00:12:52,590
Our agreement with Sandy Hook Promise prevents us from disclosing the number of tips or the nature of tips.

54
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,942
We work with our team to manage these tips as they come in.

55
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:59,143
And again, with coordination with Medford police as there's needed.

56
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:09,909
And where we are going, Sandy Hook promise programming is now provided at no cost in perpetuity.

57
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:22,036
So that was the concern when we started bringing on the anonymous tip line because it is so complex in terms of training and takes quite a bit of planning to implement it.

58
00:13:23,171 --> 00:13:25,512
that we wanted to make sure this was going to be sustainable.

59
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,493
And again, it is no cost in the future for us.

60
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:31,335
So we'll be able to continue with this programming if it's successful.

61
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:33,656
Thank you, Ms.

62
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:33,996
Schulman.

63
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,076
Member McLaughlin?

64
00:13:35,436 --> 00:13:36,237
Yes, thank you, Ms.

65
00:13:36,437 --> 00:13:38,038
Schulman, for that report.

66
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:43,640
I just had a couple of questions.

67
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:52,104
How are the students informed of this process in terms of the start with hello, the say something,

68
00:13:53,403 --> 00:13:55,584
in the system, how are they trained?

69
00:13:56,204 --> 00:14:01,286
So there is an annual presentation on say something and start with hello every year.

70
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:05,207
And that is usually through the advisory or the wind blocks.

71
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:09,909
Do you know if it's differentiated or interpreted at all?

72
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:11,889
It is interpreted, yes.

73
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:13,870
And differentiated?

74
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,111
Yes, there is additional supports added to classrooms with counseling staff.

75
00:14:18,131 --> 00:14:19,792
Okay, thank you.

76
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:33,257
And then for the data that, so tell me if you would just, if something comes through on the tip line, I think I understood what you were saying, that it will go to an administrator or guidance, right?

77
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,181
Or Medford 911, depending on the severity of the tip that comes in.

78
00:14:38,201 --> 00:14:46,768
So if it's someone in immediate danger or harm, or there's an extensive, you know, weapons report, it's going to go to Medford Dispatch and the school team at the same time.

79
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:48,589
And how are families notified?

80
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,819
Families are notified if their student is involved.

81
00:14:53,419 --> 00:15:02,361
So the follow-up for the TIP includes family involvement, but TIPs come in, they have the choice of reporting them anonymously, right?

82
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:05,282
That's the basis of the TIP line.

83
00:15:05,342 --> 00:15:12,464
So if a student reports it, we don't know who they are, we can't notify families, but if students are involved, we're contacting families as a follow-up process.

84
00:15:12,924 --> 00:15:15,785
Right, but if a student obviously is in danger, you notify.

85
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:16,885
Yes, of course, yes.

86
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,792
And then, thank you.

87
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:29,242
And so, just, if you don't mind just procedurally if you'll walk me through it so like sure what happens like somebody gets a.

88
00:15:30,464 --> 00:15:34,889
notice on their email and then they walk down the hot like tell me just walk me through it if you don't mind.

89
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:39,054
So there are different levels based on the tip that comes in.

90
00:15:39,595 --> 00:15:45,101
If it is a tip that requires follow up, but not necessarily urgent danger.

91
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:48,245
So there's someone saying I witnessed someone.

92
00:15:49,526 --> 00:16:05,077
you know, talking badly about somebody else or posting something on social media that was concerning, they either call, text, or go through the website in terms of connecting with the hotline.

93
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:09,991
The crisis counselor takes as much, they have to fill out a form while doing so.

94
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:12,934
The crisis counselor connects with that person as much as they can.

95
00:16:13,355 --> 00:16:16,298
What we've seen is sometimes people fill out the form and then disconnect.

96
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:20,402
Either they're logging out of their computer, logging an app, and there's no continued conversation.

97
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:27,070
But the counselor reaches out for about 10 to 15 minutes trying to engage that person in continued conversation.

98
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:34,010
Once the tip is finalized enough that there is information, that tip is then sent to the appropriate area.

99
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:41,752
So we worked with Sandy Hook Promise to develop both our school-based teams, our district-wide teams, and working with Medford 911 for how to connect.

100
00:16:42,112 --> 00:16:49,093
The tip goes out, and depending on the severity, you either get a tip, a text, a phone call, or both.

101
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:52,394
And they work through a hierarchy.

102
00:16:52,434 --> 00:16:53,694
We have three to five people.

103
00:16:55,202 --> 00:17:13,459
per team, depending on the team, most it's five or more, and they start calling you one by one to make sure that you've received the tip, or again, it's a text, and then it says on my phone, it says S-S-A-R-S, so Sandy Hook, and I have to open it, and then it'll tell you who's read the tip.

104
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:21,106
We have a process for managing those tips in terms of a schedule for who is responding.

105
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:23,510
So the crisis team is 24-7?

106
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:27,093
Crisis team is 24-7, yes.

107
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,635
Tips that are non-life-threatening, I believe it's 6 a.m.

108
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:31,476
to 10 p.m.

109
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:33,437
come to our phone via text.

110
00:17:33,457 --> 00:17:34,758
They let us sleep for eight hours.

111
00:17:35,459 --> 00:17:37,940
If there is a life-threatening text at night, my cell phone will ring.

112
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:40,782
And is there an interpretation line for that, do you know?

113
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:43,224
Yes, there is interpretation through Sandy Hook.

114
00:17:43,284 --> 00:17:44,965
Otherwise, if people need interpretation.

115
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,626
Yes, absolutely, they have a lot.

116
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:48,087
Great, thank you.

117
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:50,964
Thank you, Ms.

118
00:17:50,984 --> 00:17:51,605
Shulman.

119
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:52,566
If I could ask a question.

120
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,910
Oh, from the chair, and then I'll go to Ms.

121
00:17:55,431 --> 00:17:56,052
Member Graham.

122
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:57,815
Can you tell us how it's

123
00:17:58,322 --> 00:18:03,267
been working last 3 months and we able to keep up with the reporting that is coming into school psychologist.

124
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:04,848
Yes, we're able to keep up with that.

125
00:18:06,069 --> 00:18:15,878
You know there is the training gives us information that says the first 4 to 6 weeks maybe a little bit longer you have a stronger number of tips that come in.

126
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:17,920
So at the beginning it's a lot.

127
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:20,522
But it's not certainly anything you can't match.

128
00:18:21,563 --> 00:18:22,384
Thank you member Graham.

129
00:18:23,846 --> 00:18:24,166
Thank you.

130
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:32,651
Why does Sandy Hook require us to sign agreements that you can't disclose the amount of reporting coming in?

131
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:41,358
They're really protective around the anonymous reports and their worry is that someone might be able to identify who put a tip in.

132
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:49,686
So if I were to say we received one tip or two tips and then someone's able to identify who put that in, that's the concern.

133
00:18:50,845 --> 00:19:02,920
And so how will we or the public or students know that the program is being executed with integrity and fidelity and all that?

134
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:06,745
Like if there's no reporting, how does anybody know that it's working?

135
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,728
I guess that's what I'm trying to understand.

136
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:28,392
Well, City Hook Promise is pretty diligent in terms of us as far as what our requirements are and they connect with us regularly to make sure that, you know, both we've received the tips, we have to log on, there's a lot of requirements and they will pull the program if you're not managing the tips and we are required to follow up with what our actions are for the tips.

137
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:39,784
So we say parents called, counseling provided, crisis line contacted, depending on what came in, we are responsible for providing them that information so they know that we're closing that out.

138
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:41,365
Got it, thank you.

139
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:42,567
Member Russo.

140
00:19:43,271 --> 00:19:43,651
Thank you.

141
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:49,877
I was glad to hear that makes a lot of sense why they wouldn't allow that disclosure in the near term.

142
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:55,663
I'm just wondering about disclosure for the previous year, for instance.

143
00:19:56,984 --> 00:20:04,191
Obviously, we're not there yet, but the full lockdown of that data does give me pause as to whether we're

144
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,231
you know, how's it working?

145
00:20:08,392 --> 00:20:12,673
It's good to hear that Sandy Hook is willing to kick us out the door if we're not doing our part.

146
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:30,878
Do they also have any kind of metrics on sort of a quality metric saying you've got 4,200 students, let's just say 3,000 students or whatever are in the program or could be using it.

147
00:20:31,642 --> 00:20:40,045
And do they have any kind of metric that says, you know, look, if you're not getting five tips a week on average, you obviously are not implementing it properly.

148
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:40,686
Good.

149
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:43,887
So they will kick us out if we're just not really, it's not getting used.

150
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:46,288
Cause I think that's my concern is.

151
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:46,728
Okay.

152
00:20:47,648 --> 00:20:50,750
So they have a significant amount of checks and balances.

153
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:56,452
So they track through and make sure, and we have to input how many students were trained.

154
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:09,508
Their general consensus based on our numbers is that we should receive about 80 to 100 tips a year at the high school and then divide that in half for each, 40 to 50 for each of the middle schools.

155
00:21:09,588 --> 00:21:13,650
Again, you're expecting more upfront, more come up through the trainings.

156
00:21:14,011 --> 00:21:20,615
The benefit of having all of the systems is that there is woven language through each of them.

157
00:21:20,955 --> 00:21:23,137
So after signs of suicide, you talk about

158
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:25,598
having the anonymous reporting system.

159
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:31,023
And this is something if you're concerned about a friend and you don't want them to know that you're reporting this, this is an avenue for this, right?

160
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:32,364
Start with hello.

161
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:34,405
They talk about like signs of loneliness.

162
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:36,006
Again, that follows through.

163
00:21:36,327 --> 00:21:43,132
But in each of these areas, we have to report who we are training, how much we are training, and we have benchmarks to meet all that.

164
00:21:43,612 --> 00:21:49,697
And I have my contacts and the supervisors at Sandy Hook Promise that I connect with quite often.

165
00:21:50,557 --> 00:22:07,688
And they're very helpful as well in terms of technical glitches and responding to us and walking us through the process in terms of making sure that we understand who are our contacts at the crisis center and when we need support for something or may need help with the programming.

166
00:22:08,322 --> 00:22:09,823
Great, this is excellent.

167
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:16,065
Sounds like they've really buttoned this all up so that they don't have their name getting ruined by districts.

168
00:22:16,225 --> 00:22:24,368
Just don't try or I know that like where I work, our vendor has these enormous requirements every year that cost many millions of dollars.

169
00:22:25,089 --> 00:22:30,070
The reason we have to do it is because they're the name that ends up in the globe if something goes wrong.

170
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:36,253
So it's good to see they're protecting their reputation by making sure we implement

171
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,741
with fidelity.

172
00:22:38,842 --> 00:22:45,947
And do you anticipate any, I know you mentioned costs, that it's in perpetuity, it's not going to cost anything for the software.

173
00:22:47,609 --> 00:22:51,272
Do we have any estimate on the costs for training staff?

174
00:22:51,632 --> 00:22:53,013
It's free.

175
00:22:53,814 --> 00:22:55,715
So they pay for our staff's time?

176
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:58,718
They pay to provide us with the training.

177
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:01,119
It's our responsibility to make sure that is

178
00:23:02,093 --> 00:23:06,056
you know, set in a schedule throughout the year for our staff.

179
00:23:06,437 --> 00:23:12,281
That was sort of what's my concern is that, you know, we have the minimum number of professional development days a district can have in Medford.

180
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:16,645
You know, if we're in Cambridge where they have nine a day a year, we have three.

181
00:23:16,925 --> 00:23:17,125
Right.

182
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:22,870
Them fitting additional required trainings in Cambridge, I'm assuming is reasonably easy.

183
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:30,997
I just worry long term, or are they tracking the training happen on an individual basis?

184
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,353
they are tracking the training for students.

185
00:23:33,773 --> 00:23:37,536
So once you've trained your faculties and once you've, it's a train the trainer model.

186
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:46,264
So for example, signs of suicide in November of 2019, we partnered up with Everett public schools who are very gracious and allowed us to partner on their PD day.

187
00:23:46,584 --> 00:23:54,951
And the district attorney's office came in with Sandy Hook promise and trained counselors and some administrators on that signs of suicide programming.

188
00:23:55,373 --> 00:24:07,758
Counselors are now the trainers for their building, and they make sure that they are training the other counselors, which is an online platform they could do at their own time, and then working in conjunction with teachers to roll out that programming.

189
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,980
So they have really thought it through.

190
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,222
There are refreshers every year as well that they change up a little bit.

191
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:22,465
So students, yes, are receiving the same messages, but it's not a canned video that they're just like, we've seen this again.

192
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,291
because the hope is that you're keeping them engaged in the process.

193
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:41,135
And they are very thoughtful, and I have been very impressed in terms of what they're offering us, how they're offering us, and how they worked through states and now have had more grant funding to allow us to continue access to the program with oversight.

194
00:24:41,495 --> 00:24:42,395
Thank you very much.

195
00:24:42,615 --> 00:24:43,315
Member McLaughlin.

196
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:47,616
Thank you.

197
00:24:48,717 --> 00:24:49,217
Two questions.

198
00:24:49,337 --> 00:24:49,557
One is,

199
00:24:50,387 --> 00:24:54,189
Does, oh, is this involved with the mobile crisis center crisis at all?

200
00:24:54,229 --> 00:25:02,213
Like, do we have a mobile crisis, I guess, van or I guess every, so I've been working with the CBHI.

201
00:25:02,513 --> 00:25:02,673
Yes.

202
00:25:03,134 --> 00:25:05,795
And I was under the impression that every community needed to have a mobile.

203
00:25:06,155 --> 00:25:06,795
That is correct.

204
00:25:06,956 --> 00:25:07,156
Yeah.

205
00:25:07,296 --> 00:25:10,657
So ours recently changed.

206
00:25:10,737 --> 00:25:17,541
Cambridge Health Alliance is our, through Rosie's Law, is our mobile crisis provider.

207
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:19,482
They've been excellent so far.

208
00:25:20,029 --> 00:25:23,652
The response time is very quick, under an hour, which is legally required to be.

209
00:25:24,493 --> 00:25:34,261
So I just publicly say I've been impressed with their responsiveness, and we would utilize them if we felt a student needed an evaluation and needed it quickly, and we work with parents to figure out the best route for that.

210
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,723
And do you know who pays for the mobile crisis?

211
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:43,208
It's typically through health insurance, but my understanding is they can't refuse you to a certain point.

212
00:25:44,554 --> 00:25:47,915
Yes, that is, it does get complicated at times.

213
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:50,356
Yeah, because what if you don't have health insurance?

214
00:25:50,396 --> 00:25:51,036
Like, what is that?

215
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:52,156
Then we problem solve.

216
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:53,837
Okay.

217
00:25:54,897 --> 00:26:06,421
And then the other is, do you know if there exists yet, I know that there was some, there is at least law enforcement training around autism and other disabilities, but do you know if there's any

218
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:23,231
of this that offers training around disability and understanding of, for example, autism or any of the other disabilities where there may be some nuances that you really need to understand from a disability perspective around some of the potential behaviors?

219
00:26:23,591 --> 00:26:31,795
So yes, there is a responsibility on the professionals who are responding, but in terms of Sandy Hook, they're training us how to receive the tips.

220
00:26:33,246 --> 00:26:38,988
So they're not providing training on how to act in your professional capacity afterwards, if that makes sense.

221
00:26:39,668 --> 00:26:47,630
But if there is somebody, if there's a student that is known to have a known disability, I would assume you would then bring in Ms.

222
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:49,651
Bowen's team or others from Ms.

223
00:26:49,671 --> 00:26:52,692
Bowen's team, some specialized support.

224
00:26:53,274 --> 00:26:53,694
Correct.

225
00:26:53,894 --> 00:26:57,736
So the benefit is that these tips are coming to the school community.

226
00:26:57,876 --> 00:27:02,018
Again, unless it's an immediate life-threatening situation, that's going directly to 911.

227
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:06,820
And then you're working with the knowledge that you already have of your students on how you respond.

228
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:14,223
So they're not requiring us to respond in a specific pattern because every student is different, every situation is different.

229
00:27:14,243 --> 00:27:21,686
So they're requiring our connections, right, and our relationships and our professional knowledge of students in order to respond to those moments.

230
00:27:23,422 --> 00:27:23,762
Thank you, Ms.

231
00:27:23,782 --> 00:27:24,623
Shillman.

232
00:27:24,803 --> 00:27:28,404
I think you want to revert back to the motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

233
00:27:28,424 --> 00:27:30,905
I have a motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

234
00:27:31,145 --> 00:27:34,487
Member Graham, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

235
00:27:34,507 --> 00:27:35,187
All those in favor?

236
00:27:35,207 --> 00:27:35,908
Aye.

237
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:37,108
All those opposed?

238
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:39,529
Motion to revert has been approved.

239
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:43,331
We have our first item under report of the superintendent.

240
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,192
Superintendent's updates and comments.

241
00:27:45,432 --> 00:27:46,472
Dr. Maurice Edwards.

242
00:27:48,874 --> 00:27:49,854
Good evening, everyone.

243
00:27:52,276 --> 00:28:02,706
So I know I can't believe that March and spring is just around the corner, although snow is continuing to try to poke its head, but that's all right.

244
00:28:04,027 --> 00:28:12,355
But I do just bring to the community's attention that there were some special celebrations that are taking place.

245
00:28:13,416 --> 00:28:15,098
And this evening,

246
00:28:16,553 --> 00:28:19,676
the Jewish holiday of Purim is taking place.

247
00:28:20,836 --> 00:28:23,599
Purim means the Feast of Lots.

248
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:30,084
It is a joyous festival commemorating the survival of the Jewish people in the fifth century BC.

249
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:34,988
I'd like to wish all of our Jewish students and families a wonderful Purim.

250
00:28:36,909 --> 00:28:42,454
Also this Wednesday, March 8th, begins the Hindu Festival of Holi.

251
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:51,999
Holi marks the beginning of spring and has been celebrated in India for centuries, dating back to the fourth century.

252
00:28:53,040 --> 00:29:02,384
It is one of the most popular Hindu festivals, also known as the festival of colors, the festival of spring, and the festival of love.

253
00:29:03,544 --> 00:29:07,226
To our Hindu students and families, I hope you have an enjoyable Holi.

254
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:14,842
I have some wonderful announcements to share with the community this evening.

255
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:29,212
This past weekend, 12 of our Mustangs represented Medford at the Region IV Science and Engineering Fair held at Tufts University.

256
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:34,175
22 schools were represented.

257
00:29:36,124 --> 00:29:46,655
The team of Dan Khoi Nguyen, Vina Lee, Owen Lau named their project, I Lost My Marbles.

258
00:29:48,778 --> 00:29:54,424
Does more randomness increase the accuracy of statistics-based measurements?

259
00:29:56,092 --> 00:30:06,642
These students won the Tufts University Science Fair Prize as the best Medford project, and it ranked 13th overall.

260
00:30:08,023 --> 00:30:13,948
They won $250 and qualified for the State Science Fair.

261
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:20,875
The following students, Morgan Reynolds, Oprah McHara,

262
00:30:22,677 --> 00:30:32,044
Rakshita Shankarganesh submitted the project, How Does the Weather Affect Cosmic Ray Moons?

263
00:30:33,826 --> 00:30:43,854
Julie Desautels, Charlotte Yamamoto, and Marie Loren submitted J Prize, which deals with physics.

264
00:30:45,515 --> 00:30:50,059
Mary Schmidt submitted, How to Get Rid of Tea Stains?

265
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:57,874
and Clay Canavan submitted, The Lifetime of Muons Before Decay.

266
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:02,997
All of these students were awarded Starbuck gift cards.

267
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:11,524
Congratulations to our STAR students and special thanks to Mr. Cieri and Mr. Wagnus for their assistance.

268
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:13,986
So congratulations to all of you.

269
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:25,738
I'd also like to say congratulations to our Mustang teams who made it to the MIAA winter season tournaments.

270
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:34,421
The boys hockey team beat Agawam High at home last Monday, 7-1.

271
00:31:35,722 --> 00:31:38,503
On Thursday, they traveled to Canton.

272
00:31:40,094 --> 00:31:45,578
A power-packed team, and despite a tough fight, lost three to zero.

273
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,563
The boys' basketball team lost a heartbreaker at puberty.

274
00:31:51,583 --> 00:31:53,345
Are you ready for this?

275
00:31:53,365 --> 00:31:55,887
67 to 66.

276
00:31:57,528 --> 00:31:59,249
So that definitely was a heartbreaker.

277
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:03,453
The girls' hockey team traveled to St.

278
00:32:03,513 --> 00:32:04,353
Mary's of Lynn

279
00:32:05,788 --> 00:32:12,092
And they fought hard as they battled the top ranked team in the area, losing six to zero.

280
00:32:13,393 --> 00:32:16,654
We are so proud of all of our winter sport athlete students.

281
00:32:17,775 --> 00:32:19,216
We are Mustang strong.

282
00:32:19,796 --> 00:32:25,320
Just a note, tryouts for spring sports begin March 20th.

283
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,523
Students do need to register on the athletics website prior to tryouts.

284
00:32:32,144 --> 00:32:33,204
And speaking of teams,

285
00:32:34,605 --> 00:32:37,287
Medford High School just added a new one.

286
00:32:37,827 --> 00:32:39,148
This is hot off the press.

287
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:48,013
It's eSports, which stands for electronic sports and is not to be confused with video games.

288
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:59,340
The team takes video gaming to another level with organized competitive gameplay between two high school teams.

289
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:03,163
Our students are so excited to begin competing

290
00:33:03,903 --> 00:33:09,208
And we want to thank Mr. Maldonado for bringing this sport to our Mustangs.

291
00:33:09,828 --> 00:33:14,672
And this has existed for about two weeks, so it is a brand new team at the high school.

292
00:33:16,874 --> 00:33:19,757
More congratulations from our music department.

293
00:33:20,758 --> 00:33:24,781
The following Mustang students performed at all states.

294
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:38,310
Joseph Shimon, Jason Taha, Lise Shogren, Ruf Nakatande, Alistair Smith, and Jack Bolito.

295
00:33:39,231 --> 00:33:48,840
In addition, Angel Sol's original composition was recognized by MMEA's Contemporary Creators Festival,

296
00:33:49,700 --> 00:34:05,890
All seven of the students participated in a composition and songwriting forum that included feedback on Andrew's work from composition and songwriting professors from Berkeley, UMass Lowell, and Boston Conservatory.

297
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,072
What a wonderful opportunity for these students.

298
00:34:10,874 --> 00:34:12,475
We have a few upcoming events.

299
00:34:13,475 --> 00:34:22,719
Our Middle School Unified Basketball Clinic began today at the McGlynn School and will continue after school each Monday in March.

300
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:35,025
This Wednesday, March 8th, CPAC will be hosting a general business meeting by Zoom from 6 to 8 p.m., and there is a Zoom link for that.

301
00:34:37,029 --> 00:34:45,857
And on Wednesday, Medford High School will be hosting an advanced placement information session in the Caron Theater at 6 p.m.

302
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:57,178
On Thursday, March 9, CPAC and their partners are hosting Bullying, What Parents Need to Know.

303
00:34:58,078 --> 00:35:01,540
It's going to be by Zoom from 7 to 9 p.m.

304
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:07,084
The registration link was sent out by school messenger this afternoon.

305
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:15,707
Continuing our partnership with Spotlight Productions, this weekend, Annie Jr.

306
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:17,469
opens at the Caron Theater.

Adaptive Cast will perform at 1 p.m.

310
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:36,066
They sound wonderful, we hear them practicing after school, so I think it's gonna be an excellent treat.

311
00:35:36,306 --> 00:35:40,250
I hope you're able to come out and support that production this weekend.

312
00:35:41,311 --> 00:35:48,878
On March 12th, the Medford Family Network is hosting a clothing and book swap from 1 to 4 p.m.

313
00:35:49,098 --> 00:35:50,199
at Temple Shalom.

314
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:55,224
Please register with the Medford Family Network in order to attend.

315
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:04,164
On March 15th, Medford High School will be hosting two important information events.

316
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:11,767
The Medford-Malden Transition Fair will be held in the gym from 6 to 8 p.m.

317
00:36:12,788 --> 00:36:23,713
The fair is designed to provide students, families, caregivers, and professionals with information about community-based services for adults with disabilities.

318
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:38,322
There will be over 25 exhibitors representing vocational job training and support, adaptive education programs, recreational opportunities, and supported housing.

319
00:36:39,517 --> 00:36:45,385
The event is free and open to all members of Medford, Malden, and surrounding communities.

320
00:36:46,686 --> 00:36:56,539
Students between the ages of 14 and 22 who receive special education services through their IEP are encouraged to attend.

321
00:36:57,745 --> 00:37:07,132
The exhibitors will be reaching out to adults with autism, developmental disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and emotional disabilities.

00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:52,090
It's a very important evening for parents to come out to find out about the course selection for your rising 9th grade student as they prepare to enter the high school.

326
00:37:53,737 --> 00:38:01,700
So in closing, March is Irish American Heritage Month in the United States.

327
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,242
Beginning in the middle 1800s, Irish immigrants began settling here in Medford.

328
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:13,964
Like so many immigrants before and after them, they sought a better life in America.

329
00:38:15,481 --> 00:38:17,625
While Irish Americans celebrate St.

330
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:26,302
Patrick's Day on March 17, we all celebrate along with them, for they helped to build the country as well.

331
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:31,303
I would like to share with you an old Irish blessing.

332
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:37,166
It says, may love and laughter light your days and warm your heart and home.

333
00:38:37,886 --> 00:38:42,169
May good and faithful friends be yours wherever you may roam.

334
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:47,312
May peace and plenty bless your world with joy that long endures.

335
00:38:47,892 --> 00:38:52,454
May all life's passing seasons bring the best to you and yours.

336
00:38:53,175 --> 00:38:53,555
Thank you.

337
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:58,240
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Woodson.

338
00:39:00,221 --> 00:39:11,907
We have a presentation on travel forms to be presented for approval per travel policy for the ethics team to travel to and compete at the Ethics Bowl National Competition at the University of North Carolina.

339
00:39:12,827 --> 00:39:19,111
Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities, brought this before us last meeting and to the forum today.

340
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:20,291
Welcome.

341
00:39:22,933 --> 00:39:23,293
Good evening.

342
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:31,912
across the third button.

343
00:39:35,513 --> 00:39:39,395
No, it looks like a face, little face with the tap that face.

344
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:39,936
There you go.

345
00:39:40,176 --> 00:39:40,576
All right.

346
00:39:40,896 --> 00:39:41,416
Sorry.

347
00:39:41,696 --> 00:39:43,617
Usually it's on for me.

348
00:39:43,837 --> 00:39:50,520
I believe you have the form that was requested at the last meeting, but if there's any questions on it, I'm more than happy to answer.

349
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,101
Great.

350
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:53,422
Thank you for providing it to us.

351
00:39:57,704 --> 00:39:58,164
Member Rousseau.

352
00:39:59,068 --> 00:40:00,869
I'm just going to motion to approve.

353
00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:01,869
Second.

354
00:40:02,729 --> 00:40:05,070
Motion to approve by member Rousseau, seconded by member Graham.

355
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,031
All those in favor?

356
00:40:06,531 --> 00:40:06,611
Aye.

357
00:40:07,091 --> 00:40:07,891
All those opposed?

358
00:40:09,812 --> 00:40:10,012
Thank you.

359
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:10,652
Motion was approved.

360
00:40:10,692 --> 00:40:11,172
Thank you.

361
00:40:11,192 --> 00:40:12,093
Thank you.

362
00:40:15,254 --> 00:40:15,674
I'm sorry.

363
00:40:15,734 --> 00:40:15,874
Yep.

364
00:40:16,154 --> 00:40:16,914
I'm staying up anyway.

365
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:17,635
Oh, you, okay.

366
00:40:17,655 --> 00:40:17,915
Yeah.

367
00:40:17,995 --> 00:40:18,895
I thought you came just for that.

368
00:40:18,955 --> 00:40:20,236
I'm like, this is terrible.

369
00:40:20,936 --> 00:40:24,937
I learned something too.

370
00:40:24,997 --> 00:40:25,757
I learned tonight.

371
00:40:28,129 --> 00:40:29,109
Okay, that makes me feel better.

372
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:40,975
Update on Literacy Corps program review process, Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities, Dr. Bernadette Riccidelli, Director of Professional Learning Assessment, and Ms.

373
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:44,416
Suzanne Galluzzi, Assistant Superintendent of Academics and Instruction.

374
00:40:44,536 --> 00:40:44,876
Welcome.

375
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,558
All right, so I'm gonna get us started and then

376
00:40:51,288 --> 00:40:51,428
Ms.

377
00:40:51,448 --> 00:40:54,349
Galussi and Dr. Riccadeli will also be presenting.

378
00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:09,155
So as you know, from many of our literacy reports over the years, the district has been working hard to build our capacity with the science of reading, as well as implement our foundational skills program called Enhanced Core Reading Instruction.

379
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:18,119
Building this capacity was very important prior to selecting or even beginning the process of selecting a new core program.

380
00:41:19,244 --> 00:41:27,068
We're very excited today to be here to give you an update on the Literacy Core Program, excuse me, on the Literacy Core Program review process.

381
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:35,613
So I'm gonna begin with the work that was done last year, and then go into some of the work that is being done as we speak.

382
00:41:36,733 --> 00:41:47,319
In school year 21 to 22, the district convened a team of diverse stakeholders that engaged in a full review of all high quality instructional literacy materials.

383
00:41:48,274 --> 00:42:00,518
Part of this review was familiarizing the team with the mass literacy, which includes skills for early reading, as well as DESE's MTSS system of support.

384
00:42:01,239 --> 00:42:12,343
In addition, the team heavily utilized both ed reports as well as curate so that they could make some well-educated decisions on elementary reading program choices.

385
00:42:14,423 --> 00:42:14,984
By June 2022,

386
00:42:16,796 --> 00:42:22,421
Using these resources, the team had three recommendations for a new elementary reading program.

387
00:42:23,202 --> 00:42:32,250
And these recommendations were again, reviewed and still being reviewed by the larger literacy team, which is going on this school year.

388
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:36,954
So we take that group, and then we segue into this school year.

389
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:41,859
And this is what we call the second stage of the literacy core program review.

390
00:42:42,677 --> 00:42:58,523
This includes a partnership with Hill for Literacy, a formalized elementary district literacy leadership team, school-based literacy leadership teams, as well as a parent-guardian task force.

391
00:42:59,764 --> 00:43:04,788
An integral part of this second stage is the core program review process.

392
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:12,635
And to date, what we have done as a team is formalize the elementary literacy vision.

393
00:43:13,816 --> 00:43:19,521
We have, the team has then reviewed the three recommendations that came out of last year.

394
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:27,768
They have then had the opportunity to eliminate, add, and or maintain the three recommendations.

395
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:37,090
And now they will then be beginning a full literacy core program review through the school-based literacy teams.

396
00:43:41,812 --> 00:43:44,974
All right, good evening.

397
00:43:45,054 --> 00:43:51,137
So the second part of your report, I'm just going to go into a little bit more detail about the timeline that you have.

398
00:43:51,758 --> 00:43:53,639
So as Dr. Chiesa highlighted,

399
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,011
might be it's like moving parts right now, right?

400
00:43:57,031 --> 00:44:03,013
So we have the district level leadership team, and then we also have the school-based teams.

401
00:44:04,514 --> 00:44:13,578
Those two teams are gonna kind of come together as well as the parent task force in helping to select the literacy program.

402
00:44:14,358 --> 00:44:24,202
So the parent, this, I know I've spoken about this previously, but I also just wanna highlight that we've applied for a grant throughout this process.

403
00:44:24,981 --> 00:44:31,267
So the grant is competitive, but it's also highly, it's a really tight turnaround.

404
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:34,710
I know I reported on this previously, but I just want to remind you.

405
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:42,356
So the grant, which we have our fingers crossed, apparently it's on the governor's desk right now.

406
00:44:42,477 --> 00:44:51,725
So we're just waiting to hear back, but it has to, we have to have everything, we have to have the decision made and all materials purchased and received by the end of June.

407
00:44:52,717 --> 00:45:06,032
So in order to get all of this done in a timely manner and make sure that we're incorporating all stakeholders, we're going to be, at the conclusion of this meeting,

408
00:45:06,858 --> 00:45:13,162
sending out survey to parents and guardians, elementary parents and guardians, that wish to be a part of this process.

409
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:22,549
And from there, Dr. Chiesa, Dr. Riccadeli and I will be holding meetings, providing them resource materials to review.

410
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:36,518
Part of this timeline, as you have in front of you, just illustrates the meeting dates that we have, but the conclusion of this kind of vetting, deep dive research that will be done

411
00:45:37,118 --> 00:45:58,631
will be a publisher's roundtable, which will involve all stakeholders that are a part of this process, where each publisher will come out and hold informational sessions, so that that is an opportunity for the Medford team to ask their questions directly to the publishers, so that, excuse me.

412
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:18,332
So that through this process, they're gathering their questions and then they're able to ask directly to the publisher as well as local surrounding districts that are currently using the program.

413
00:46:18,992 --> 00:46:23,956
So there are some practitioners that are also part of these round table discussions.

414
00:46:23,996 --> 00:46:32,223
So that way it gives a real complete view for the Medford team in terms of selecting the program.

415
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:47,570
I think that might cover me for right now, but I know that there'll be questions and I'll circle back to this in a minute, but I'm gonna have Dr. Riccadeli just speak about the team.

416
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:51,454
All right, so as you have heard Dr. Keyes and Ms.

417
00:46:51,474 --> 00:46:55,879
Galussi talk, we have various levels of the team.

418
00:46:55,919 --> 00:47:00,724
So the district administration team is the three of us and then Darcy from Hill for Literacy.

419
00:47:01,425 --> 00:47:07,832
The district literacy team is comprised of several different educators.

420
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:15,756
We tried to make that team as diverse in terms of the different constituent groups within the school system.

421
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:28,222
So we have elementary teachers, so K-2, so early elementary teachers on the team, upper elementary, so grade three to five teachers on the team, special education teachers,

422
00:47:28,601 --> 00:47:36,323
English language learners, teachers, reading teachers, we have school leaders, and again, we have district administrators.

423
00:47:37,103 --> 00:47:45,486
Just quickly, I'm going to name them because they are doing a lot of work in looking at the materials and examining what we have.

424
00:47:46,026 --> 00:47:52,468
So we have Maria Micheli, Camille Fargo, Carissa Margarana, Lisa Mastone, Paula Burke,

425
00:47:52,932 --> 00:48:22,702
Jen Devlin, Katie Pires, Abby Herman, Cindy Griffin, Debbie Notaro, Melissa Daugherty, Alyssa Randazzo, Jessica White, Julie Braley, Hannah Heffler, Kristen Howell, Patrice Madigan, Donna Mazie, Ann Smith, Katie Fiorentino, Katie Rockwell, Shannon Demos, Andy O'Brien, Kathy Kay, Mike DiClemente, and then the three of us, and then Julie Santos and Catherine Cook.

426
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,121
So we feel like it is a representative group, again, of the different constituent groups.

427
00:48:27,601 --> 00:48:34,103
So to date, what this team has been involved in is formalizing the elementary literacy vision.

428
00:48:34,963 --> 00:48:36,524
We are not ready to present it tonight.

429
00:48:36,564 --> 00:48:41,505
We'll be presenting it to our district literacy team on Wednesday at our meeting.

430
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:49,627
They voted, they formulated it, and they voted, and there was a clear winner on the literacy vision.

431
00:48:51,333 --> 00:49:13,188
We reviewed the three elementary reading programs from school year 21, 22, as Dr. Chiesa mentioned, but they went through the process of eliminating, adding in, or maintaining the three recommendations, and they, with the school-based teams, will be engaging in a full literacy core review process over the next few months.

432
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:17,771
Okay, so,

433
00:49:19,588 --> 00:49:26,492
So for the first round, in school year 21-22, and this I don't believe is in your report, but we do have that information.

434
00:49:27,033 --> 00:49:30,455
So from school year 21-22, there was also a representative group.

435
00:49:30,995 --> 00:49:37,979
The group was smaller, and I think it's important to know that at the same time, they were engaged in a new math program.

436
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,100
So, you know, they were competing,

437
00:49:41,863 --> 00:49:44,986
interests here with regard to teacher time.

438
00:49:45,546 --> 00:50:04,584
So with regard to teachers on that team, we had Maria Michelli, Jen O'Brien, Janelle Hill, Debbie Notaro, Kristen Howell, Donna Mazie, Katie Fiorentino, Shannon Demos, Doug Bowen Flynn, who was a lead teacher for Humanities Department, and it was led by Nicole Chiesa.

439
00:50:05,151 --> 00:50:12,498
So you will notice that some of those names are similar to the school years group, but there are some differences.

440
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,163
So with that said, we would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.

441
00:50:21,607 --> 00:50:23,008
Member Russo, then Member Graham.

442
00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:23,989
Thank you.

443
00:50:25,150 --> 00:50:31,212
I was happy to hear that there are surrounding districts that have adopted certain programs that will be at the roundtables.

444
00:50:32,193 --> 00:50:40,437
I mean, none of us are silly enough to think that they just got to be there on their own, that they were selected.

445
00:50:41,177 --> 00:50:43,278
It was a two-way process of being included.

446
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:51,182
Is there any way we can require that the districts that come to these roundtables are like districts?

447
00:50:52,861 --> 00:50:55,263
we're probably not gonna learn much with how Cambridge did.

448
00:50:56,043 --> 00:50:58,465
I mentioned them because they are the outlier in the entire state.

449
00:51:00,286 --> 00:51:04,989
The resources that they, for instance, could bring to bear on any project are staggering.

450
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:17,297
I wanna know that the programs from the district's perspective are districts that are as like us as, I mean, somewhat similar to us.

451
00:51:17,497 --> 00:51:21,320
I mean, it just, you know, it goes through a list of communities for which if they send their folks

452
00:51:22,088 --> 00:51:24,350
I hope nobody thinks that's useful information.

453
00:51:25,592 --> 00:51:25,912
Thank you.

454
00:51:27,073 --> 00:51:27,634
Absolutely.

455
00:51:27,734 --> 00:51:36,523
And I think that's part of Hill's process when they do this, because you learn so much from the practitioning districts that are already going through it that can explain

456
00:51:38,396 --> 00:51:39,977
their personal perspective.

457
00:51:40,417 --> 00:51:43,639
Just a few points on that though as well is that this shift.

458
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:49,903
So we also have been looking at neighboring districts to see what they're doing for literacy.

459
00:51:51,324 --> 00:51:53,765
I'm on a list serve with the other assistant superintendents.

460
00:51:53,805 --> 00:52:03,371
And so there's a compilation of spreadsheets just to make sure the alignment in this shift to the science of reading because every district is going through this.

461
00:52:04,111 --> 00:52:08,674
As you know, because we've talked about this several times, we kind of got right on board right away.

462
00:52:08,794 --> 00:52:12,175
Many districts are really just beginning a lot of this work.

463
00:52:13,056 --> 00:52:28,604
So I also want to say that in terms of the Department of Education and a lot of the research that is out there, equitable literacy instruction is gained through a lot of these core programs.

464
00:52:28,804 --> 00:52:31,126
That's why Massachusetts, all of their grants

465
00:52:32,333 --> 00:52:53,643
are pushing districts to the alignment of a core program, because the research and a lot of what's out there says that the core programs, whether there's always going to be people that are supportive of a core program and people that don't like core programs, but in the absence of a core program, you fracture literacy instruction.

466
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:55,960
and you can create gaps and holes.

467
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:09,131
And so to make sure that all of our students are getting the literacy instruction that they need, which is equitable literacy, a core program will check all of those boxes.

468
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:20,662
So part of this process is to determine what's best for Medford with the viewpoints of, as both Dr. Riccadeli and Dr. Chiesa mentioned,

469
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,881
diverse roles within the district, and then bringing in the parent voice.

470
00:53:26,522 --> 00:53:43,648
I understand that parents bring a different lens, which is a very important lens that we wanna make sure we capture, but the content knowledge, the skill base, and the priorities are gonna be different for teachers and parents, but we have to make sure we're capturing all of that.

471
00:53:46,508 --> 00:53:47,149
Great, thank you.

472
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:47,889
Member Graham?

473
00:53:49,172 --> 00:53:49,612
Thank you.

474
00:53:50,053 --> 00:53:51,573
What programs are we looking at?

475
00:53:53,054 --> 00:53:53,394
You want to say?

476
00:53:53,414 --> 00:53:54,615
Go ahead.

477
00:53:56,216 --> 00:54:17,088
Again, the team is in the process of eliminating or maintaining, but the three are Savices Learning Company is called My View Literacy, Wonders, which is by McGraw-Hill, and HMH, which is called Into Reading.

478
00:54:26,817 --> 00:54:29,378
my view literacy by the service learning company.

479
00:54:33,999 --> 00:54:34,879
Thank you for the presentation.

480
00:54:35,499 --> 00:54:39,180
I'm sorry just one more question members so last question.

481
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:40,280
Thank you.

482
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:42,301
I'm on the cat.

483
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:55,944
Health curriculum review committee and you know we just did a topic with what we do a topic every time we meet where there are members of the committee that like you know they're the specialists

484
00:54:56,365 --> 00:54:58,466
like the experts in the country kind of thing.

485
00:54:59,126 --> 00:55:00,707
We have such an amazing community here.

486
00:55:03,228 --> 00:55:16,235
When it gets down to that last item on the list and we're doing the selection, I don't mean this to suggest that not everybody doesn't come with all the energy, but there are experts and then there are the rest of us.

487
00:55:16,795 --> 00:55:19,677
And this isn't good.

488
00:55:20,577 --> 00:55:23,459
Is the final selection gonna be a vote of all people who are,

489
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:45,062
I, it just feels awkward that people who, like two of the people might be experts in the field and 10 aren't, and maybe it's on them to convince the rest what the right choice is, but I do feel a little concerned, like, around this topic of experts versus those of us who just want to participate and help.

490
00:55:45,936 --> 00:55:47,237
We, we thank you for that.

491
00:55:48,037 --> 00:55:53,099
Um, the part of this process, Hill for Literacy has an assessment tool.

492
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:54,200
It's a review tool.

493
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:57,762
So it is a spreadsheet, which we will give to you.

494
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:08,267
Um, when we send out for the parents that are interested, parents and guardians that are interested in participating in this process, they'll receive this as well, but it breaks down all the components of the program.

495
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:11,108
And it's, it's like a rubric with a scoring piece.

496
00:56:11,796 --> 00:56:16,078
that will be reviewed by everyone that participated in this process.

497
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:23,842
So it will kind of come down to the analysis of that data.

498
00:56:28,424 --> 00:56:28,624
Great.

499
00:56:28,744 --> 00:56:29,065
Thank you.

500
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:29,485
All right.

501
00:56:29,505 --> 00:56:29,885
Thank you.

502
00:56:30,025 --> 00:56:31,886
Appreciate it.

503
00:56:31,926 --> 00:56:35,588
We are on number five report on track and field athletic needs and equipment.

504
00:56:35,688 --> 00:56:39,330
Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of enrichment and innovation.

505
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:40,210
Dr. Cushing.

506
00:56:41,206 --> 00:56:42,888
Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

507
00:56:43,509 --> 00:56:45,671
Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to you today.

508
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:54,886
Last week, a number of parents and students spoke on some issues with the track team, the track and field team.

509
00:56:55,247 --> 00:57:02,372
And what I did was I took time last week to go and visually inspect much of the equipment that I've listed on the report.

510
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:08,196
And in large part, most of the equipment looks functional.

511
00:57:08,437 --> 00:57:12,740
However, there's definitely some wear and tear and there are some items that can be replaced.

512
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,441
I really want to thank Coach Donlan as well.

513
00:57:16,001 --> 00:57:34,528
Not only is he a great teacher to see in action by his record this year and his opportunity taking the time about an hour and 15 minutes last week, meeting with myself and the superintendent, he really demonstrated his passion for the sport, his love for our students, and

514
00:57:35,387 --> 00:57:41,550
you know, definitely has the makings of a legendary coach, uh, as, as he works on med for track and field.

515
00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:48,072
So, um, the first action item is to really look at the coaching needs.

516
00:57:48,652 --> 00:57:50,693
Track and field is very discipline specific.

517
00:57:51,113 --> 00:57:56,856
Uh, if anyone on the committee has participated in track and field, um, there are two main categories.

518
00:57:56,896 --> 00:57:58,917
There are your running events and there are your field events.

519
00:57:58,957 --> 00:58:01,978
And then within those, there are certain disciplines, uh, as,

520
00:58:02,598 --> 00:58:12,149
In my coaching experience with track and field, the way that I've seen it set up is, generally speaking, the coaches are assigned by discipline, regardless of gender.

521
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:24,302
So, the throwing coach will work with both males and females, the sprinters coach, the distance coach, the high hurdles coach will work with both males and females and they will work to really hone those disciplines.

522
00:58:25,312 --> 00:58:28,313
That's one of the suggestions that we have moving forward.

523
00:58:28,373 --> 00:58:35,916
We're also going to add an additional coach based on the enrollment and make that judgment annually.

524
00:58:35,996 --> 00:58:45,440
So traditionally Medford has hired three coaches, but there is an opportunity to add an additional coach.

525
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,381
And so we're going to take that opportunity.

526
00:58:48,261 --> 00:58:54,808
The stipends are something that we are working right now as part of the December 19th agreed upon collective bargaining agreement.

527
00:58:55,669 --> 00:59:03,837
We know that our stipends need to be examined and we are building a committee to work with the teachers association.

528
00:59:04,217 --> 00:59:09,262
We've had initial conversations and we will be taking a hard comprehensive look at the stipends.

529
00:59:09,815 --> 00:59:21,860
So the first part of the action plan is to post for a second head coach, but to really work within the structure that I mentioned to field test this year the best way to do that.

530
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:22,340
So.

531
00:59:24,016 --> 00:59:27,677
Action item two is to identify the budgetary resources and fund codes.

532
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:32,318
One of the things we need to make sure is that if we approve money, that we actually have the money to spend.

533
00:59:32,878 --> 00:59:40,459
We need to be fiscally responsible, but these are the items that in speaking with Coach Donlon would be most beneficial at this time.

534
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:47,901
So the 23 hurdles, 45 hurdles were purchased about three years ago.

535
00:59:48,821 --> 00:59:52,242
So there's some that are in great shape and there's some that are not in functional shape,

536
00:59:52,942 --> 00:59:59,987
You can see that those hurdles cost probably about $9,000, the 45 that were purchased.

537
01:00:00,908 --> 01:00:04,491
These 23 hurdles would cost about $4,140.

538
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:08,274
None of this includes shipping, which is usually an additional cost.

539
01:00:09,214 --> 01:00:12,936
The four 12-pound shot puts would come to about $162.

540
01:00:13,617 --> 01:00:18,420
For eight-pound shot puts for female competitors is $128.

541
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:23,683
For male discuses is about $200.

542
01:00:24,083 --> 01:00:28,245
For a one-kilogram female discus is $160.

543
01:00:28,866 --> 01:00:33,148
Two javelins, we do have a number of javelins, but they are showing some wear and tear.

544
01:00:33,308 --> 01:00:34,129
They are functional.

545
01:00:34,709 --> 01:00:36,910
They are functional, I do want the committee to know that.

546
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,972
I didn't throw them myself, but they are functional.

547
01:00:42,372 --> 01:00:45,434
That would be about $400, they're about $200 a piece.

548
01:00:45,894 --> 01:00:50,556
And two high jump standards, they're about $700 for the set.

549
01:00:51,216 --> 01:00:53,137
That's on the high end.

550
01:00:53,177 --> 01:01:02,761
The issue is right now on one of the high jump standards is there's a vice grip pair of pliers

551
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:15,304
because, and I don't know how this happened, because it is about a quarter inch to a half inch thick bolt that has a heavy duty ring that you're then able to twist to unscrew and adjust the height.

552
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:22,415
Um, I honestly don't know how it broke off because it is such a robust piece of equipment, but it did.

553
01:01:22,936 --> 01:01:28,220
And so a vice clamp, we're having our metal fab students take a look to see if they can weld something onto it.

554
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:33,223
Um, but, uh, for $700, it would not be that much of an investment.

555
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:39,488
Uh, so then some low, no cost, um, items or some cost.

556
01:01:39,508 --> 01:01:41,529
We don't, I don't have the numbers on action item three.

557
01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:42,710
So the district over the last

558
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:49,264
Four years has purchased at least one full set of uniforms and some additional as well.

559
01:01:49,504 --> 01:01:53,468
And so what that did, though, is that some students only had triple X.

560
01:01:54,497 --> 01:01:57,459
or double X according to the coaching staff.

561
01:01:58,059 --> 01:02:07,985
And so if you're a sprinter and you're only uniform available to you as a triple X, well, that would be big, even for some of your biggest throwers.

562
01:02:08,105 --> 01:02:09,826
So what we're going to do is we're going to try.

563
01:02:09,867 --> 01:02:17,271
And one of the problems with track, I will say, having coached it previously is having the right number of uniforms in the right sizes.

564
01:02:17,831 --> 01:02:23,455
It is a challenge just because you could have a bunch more kids come out one year because of the popularity.

565
01:02:24,509 --> 01:02:25,810
and their sizes may vary.

566
01:02:25,931 --> 01:02:32,759
So we'll definitely get students to have an appropriately sized track uniform during the upcoming season.

567
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:37,366
Discus cage at Hormel, that broke prior to last season.

568
01:02:37,606 --> 01:02:38,287
I spoke with

569
01:02:38,857 --> 01:02:40,557
the Medford Recreation Department.

570
01:02:40,838 --> 01:02:42,838
I also have an email back and forth with them.

571
01:02:43,398 --> 01:02:44,799
They ordered the cage.

572
01:02:44,879 --> 01:02:48,059
The athletic director made them aware that the cage was broken.

573
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:53,441
They ordered the cage, but with shipping delays, it didn't come in until after the track season was over.

574
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:55,921
We reached out to the MIAA.

575
01:02:56,162 --> 01:03:01,683
We were approved to, from what I've been told, we were approved to have

576
01:03:02,784 --> 01:03:17,234
another area on the baseball field serve, I'm sorry, on the softball field serve as track officials can be their own governing body at times when they show up on site.

577
01:03:17,815 --> 01:03:23,219
And if they don't think something is good, then they can say you're forfeiting that event or whatever it may be.

578
01:03:23,879 --> 01:03:28,623
And so that is what seems to have happened last year.

579
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:39,667
So, but the track, the discus cage will be replaced prior to the first practice this year, according to Mr. Curley and Mr. Bailey.

580
01:03:42,014 --> 01:03:43,355
So that's actually item four.

581
01:03:43,755 --> 01:03:47,696
Action item five, uh, sand pits are filled with a gravel type sand.

582
01:03:47,736 --> 01:03:50,538
Now they haven't been rejuvenated in a number of years.

583
01:03:51,418 --> 01:03:53,079
Um, we brought the issue forward.

584
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:59,841
Also coach Donlan has been replacing the, uh, the spike plate, the jump plate, which is just a piece of wood.

585
01:04:00,942 --> 01:04:04,223
So imagine how many tracks spikes at that through practice.

586
01:04:04,403 --> 01:04:08,705
And it's an annual replacement that, uh, both he and our

587
01:04:09,147 --> 01:04:15,949
I believe our carpentry shop has been helping to replace that with Coach Donovan over the past several years.

588
01:04:17,009 --> 01:04:30,613
So I've worked, I've spoken to Kevin at the Metro Direct Department, and they will take care of both rejuvenating the sand, as well as the jump plates, if that's the right term.

589
01:04:31,853 --> 01:04:33,974
Apologize here.

590
01:04:33,994 --> 01:04:34,834
Let me just make sure.

591
01:04:35,314 --> 01:04:36,655
Action item five, sand pits.

592
01:04:36,775 --> 01:04:36,975
Okay.

593
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,421
Perfect, action item five.

594
01:04:40,081 --> 01:04:43,663
Action item seven, outdoor starting blocks at Hormel or Hormel Equipment.

595
01:04:44,624 --> 01:04:46,705
So I inspected two of these.

596
01:04:47,485 --> 01:04:49,627
One is in perfectly fine working order.

597
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:52,628
The other has some missing spikes.

598
01:04:53,249 --> 01:05:04,475
I will say, in speaking with Coach Donlan, once again, having coached track and having seen a lot of track meets in my day, because they're a tremendous amount of fun, and if you haven't been to one, I highly encourage it.

599
01:05:07,051 --> 01:05:11,333
It is normal practice for students to stand on the starting blocks.

600
01:05:11,773 --> 01:05:12,033
All right.

601
01:05:12,834 --> 01:05:18,016
It's something that some sprinters want because they want that additional assurance that the block is not going to slip.

602
01:05:19,757 --> 01:05:20,858
I myself was not a sprinter.

603
01:05:21,138 --> 01:05:23,679
So we, but I have seen it.

604
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:27,181
I know sprinters that that's something that is not a level of comfort.

605
01:05:27,261 --> 01:05:35,565
However, Mr. Bailey said that the medical recreation department is planning to start their own track program for Medford youth.

606
01:05:36,184 --> 01:05:38,385
So he is very open to purchasing those.

607
01:05:38,465 --> 01:05:41,046
The starting blocks are about $200 a piece.

608
01:05:41,546 --> 01:05:52,910
I would say that there need to be about eight purchased, but they have a significant amount of spikes similar to the spikes that would go on the bottom of your track spikes, your sprinter spikes.

609
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:58,092
So they will dig into the rubberized surface at Hormel.

610
01:05:58,112 --> 01:06:01,573
Let me just make sure of this.

611
01:06:01,773 --> 01:06:01,993
Okay.

612
01:06:03,257 --> 01:06:05,759
Yep, Simon, thank you, Madam Mayor.

613
01:06:05,979 --> 01:06:07,921
High jump mat, it's actually a four mat system.

614
01:06:08,101 --> 01:06:11,064
The three base mats run about $12,000.

615
01:06:11,104 --> 01:06:12,345
They're about 15 years old.

616
01:06:12,405 --> 01:06:13,766
They do need to be replaced.

617
01:06:14,546 --> 01:06:19,511
The goal is to have them through this coming season budget next year.

618
01:06:19,971 --> 01:06:24,054
The cover mat, which was purchased after the fact because the old mat wore out.

619
01:06:24,475 --> 01:06:27,737
Generally speaking, these mats are not put away during the season.

620
01:06:27,878 --> 01:06:29,319
They're just left out to the elements.

621
01:06:30,123 --> 01:06:35,777
That's every track program that I've ever known of because they're such a burden.

622
01:06:35,858 --> 01:06:37,863
They really are a burden to move back and forth.

623
01:06:39,736 --> 01:06:41,757
And so the top mat was replaced.

624
01:06:41,777 --> 01:06:44,539
That's about a $2,000 mat replacement.

625
01:06:44,999 --> 01:06:46,700
So we will budget to make sure that's done.

626
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:55,806
We're also gonna check if with some of our renters, if they're planning to bring in their own mats when they rent our facility next year, one of the colleges that rents our facility.

627
01:06:56,526 --> 01:06:59,248
I haven't heard back from their athletic staff yet.

628
01:06:59,428 --> 01:06:59,969
My apologies.

629
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:05,879
And then the indoor starting blocks do appear to be functional from visual inspection.

630
01:07:06,460 --> 01:07:11,771
They definitely don't have the same wear and tear that the rubber mounts.

631
01:07:12,838 --> 01:07:15,841
plates that your spikes would go into as the outdoor.

632
01:07:16,301 --> 01:07:18,683
Those do have some noticeable wear and tear.

633
01:07:20,024 --> 01:07:24,647
However, if we can repair these, I think that would be a good cost savings measure.

634
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:28,230
They're bolted to the floors in the high school gym.

635
01:07:28,631 --> 01:07:32,954
There's one that is missing a bolt at the rear, but it still has the front bolt.

636
01:07:33,354 --> 01:07:36,016
Coach Donovan mentioned that there is some slipping involved.

637
01:07:36,077 --> 01:07:44,784
So if a student doesn't properly engage them, so we're gonna see if we can have them repaired prior to having them replaced just as a cost savings.

638
01:07:45,464 --> 01:07:53,571
And then finally, there are only two schools in the GBL that have indoor track facilities.

639
01:07:55,153 --> 01:07:57,775
And because of that, the GBL made the decision

640
01:07:58,355 --> 01:08:06,197
at the end of this year to go to have all of the track meets hosted at the Reggie Lewis Center for next indoor track season.

641
01:08:08,158 --> 01:08:11,479
So that is the report thus far.

642
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:12,899
I really do want to thank Coach Donlan.

643
01:08:12,919 --> 01:08:15,300
I would thank the parents and the students who came up.

644
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:19,581
And I also want to mention that to anyone listening or whatever to feel free

645
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:28,256
to reach out to myself, the building principal, the athletic director, for other issues you may have with any of our programs.

646
01:08:29,056 --> 01:08:33,499
I definitely want to be able to help parents and students get what they need.

647
01:08:34,499 --> 01:08:35,380
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

648
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,703
One question from the chair and then member Russo, and then I believe we might have a resident who wants to speak on Zoom.

649
01:08:42,924 --> 01:08:46,326
Question for you on point number one, which is the coaching.

650
01:08:46,406 --> 01:08:48,047
So it sounds like there's always been three.

651
01:08:48,547 --> 01:08:49,348
We may go to four.

652
01:08:49,983 --> 01:09:13,948
what happened with the last season with where it was just coach Donlan and I know one was one coach was out on leave but do you know what happened with the third coach so there was so there was a third coach um yeah okay so two present one one was out all right but I will say there's no there's no denying coach Donlan had a tremendous load upon him

653
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:27,463
For the spring season, we do have already one person in the building and one person who works at a parochial school in the community who have shown high interest in coaching as assistant coaches.

654
01:09:28,343 --> 01:09:34,685
If one of those people could elevate to that and we find another coach if they want to stay as assistant coaches and, you know,

655
01:09:35,560 --> 01:09:39,582
I was encouraged by my conversations, but I don't want to speak any more about those.

656
01:09:40,723 --> 01:09:45,325
But the district would be very excited to have Coach Tomlin as part of our staff.

657
01:09:45,945 --> 01:09:48,166
So we don't know if that's going to become a reality just yet?

658
01:09:48,646 --> 01:09:48,987
Correct.

659
01:09:49,547 --> 01:09:49,807
OK.

660
01:09:50,607 --> 01:09:51,008
Thank you.

661
01:09:51,068 --> 01:09:51,808
Thank you for the update.

662
01:09:51,848 --> 01:09:52,828
Thank you for looking into this.

663
01:09:53,109 --> 01:09:56,890
On behalf of myself, I'm sure, and the entire committee.

664
01:09:57,331 --> 01:09:57,911
Member Rousseau?

665
01:09:58,571 --> 01:09:59,612
Yes, thank you.

666
01:10:01,172 --> 01:10:04,154
The budgeting, when would these mats be needed?

667
01:10:05,199 --> 01:10:10,961
They would be needed following Thanksgiving of next year.

668
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:16,423
The mats are in, they should be able to make it through the spring season.

669
01:10:17,264 --> 01:10:33,030
I'll be honest, I don't know if we were to order mats today, similar to the discus issue, and I can honestly say that I have not looked into what the shipping would be, but if we were to order them today, I don't know that they would be in for,

670
01:10:33,757 --> 01:10:34,297
start of the season.

671
01:10:34,437 --> 01:10:50,602
I would also want to look into if the mats are going to be left outside for an entire spring season that we purchased, and I don't know the cost of this, an appropriate tarpaulin cover to cover and make sure that they are secure.

672
01:10:51,362 --> 01:11:01,225
The unfortunate thing is that, you know, while Hormel is a locked stadium, from what I can tell, they could be subject to vandalism and other things.

673
01:11:01,665 --> 01:11:01,925
Thank you.

674
01:11:03,629 --> 01:11:06,451
Member Graham.

675
01:11:07,331 --> 01:11:13,514
It's great to hear we're making some progress on recruiting additional support for the program.

676
01:11:14,675 --> 01:11:26,501
This is not the first time we've had athletics related discussions where we've not only lacked a person to play the role, but we've lacked a person with a skill set to be the coach.

677
01:11:27,422 --> 01:11:31,404
And I just want to ask that before we, if we are,

678
01:11:32,108 --> 01:11:35,750
putting somebody in place to help with administrative items and that kind of thing.

679
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:46,595
Obviously like that's its own skill and you don't have to know how to throw a javelin, but we do need to find qualified coaches who have skill and can teach the kids.

680
01:11:46,836 --> 01:11:54,519
So I know that we're kind of coming up fast and I hope that some of these folks have skills that are complimentary to each other.

681
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:59,362
So we don't have like a bunch of sprinting coaches and no coaches for the field events, but I just,

682
01:11:59,995 --> 01:12:07,160
I think we need to invest a little bit more energy in recruitment and really tapping people on the shoulders.

683
01:12:08,001 --> 01:12:15,846
I had a conversation with a parent today about alumni and what are we doing to convince alumni to come back and coach and support.

684
01:12:15,866 --> 01:12:27,855
So I just think there's a lot of work to do in the long term that is over and above what has to happen to make sure the season in the spring can proceed, that we should not

685
01:12:28,648 --> 01:12:31,750
shy away from just because the immediate issue is resolved.

686
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:38,474
So I think, you know, we've heard this with other sports teams as well over time, and I'm sure the stipends have something to do with that.

687
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:53,702
But we also just need to put forth the effort to go out and find the people with the qualifications that are going to be the best coaches for the students that we are trying to teach.

688
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:55,018
Yeah.

689
01:12:55,038 --> 01:13:04,321
And one of the action items that I didn't put in here, but definitely came through my conversation with coach Tomlin is the specific professional development that coaches will need.

690
01:13:05,101 --> 01:13:22,847
Um, you know, there are coaches clinics, there are various things, but again, you know, those will come down to dollars and cents budgeting that really needs to be well thought out and make sure that, um, you know, we invest in our coaches, um, and really make sure that we have as much support for them as possible.

691
01:13:23,390 --> 01:13:23,650
Yeah.

692
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:46,523
And, you know, certainly in fairness to coach Donlan, as he had a really big task ahead of him, it's really hard to think strategically about how to grow a program, how to bring in professional development, how to create like a pipeline of students that want to come back and all the things, if you are mired in basic supervision and all the, you know, all the other stuff that is really, really important.

693
01:13:47,583 --> 01:13:56,309
but doesn't create a program that has like its own sort of life line to hang on to.

694
01:13:56,790 --> 01:14:03,074
So I think, you know, and again, I think this is probably true of lots of our sports teams.

695
01:14:03,875 --> 01:14:09,299
What is our strategic plan for each of these sports and what is needed?

696
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:15,583
I think we've asked questions before about the athletics revolving account and I don't know that we've ever seen anything that like

697
01:14:16,465 --> 01:14:20,873
paints a really clear picture of what's going on at in the various sports, but I think

698
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:31,947
asking the athletics department to start to think about the strategy around how do we create high caliber, high quality athletics teams?

699
01:14:32,127 --> 01:14:47,559
How does that contribute to students staying for Medford and going to Medford High and not leaving for all the other schools in the area that are relying on schools like ours to train middle school students and then coach them, right?

700
01:14:48,044 --> 01:14:59,866
So how do we create a situation where we have some strategic planning going on that starts to sort of shift that at various sports, I think is a conversation we need to have.

701
01:15:00,507 --> 01:15:03,707
And it obviously needs some dedicated budget and that kind of thing.

702
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:14,189
But I think it's really important as we think about the whole child and what gets kids up in the morning to go to school and what constitutes an education.

703
01:15:14,249 --> 01:15:17,090
It's not just about what they learn in the classroom.

704
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:23,908
And maybe it's athletics, maybe it's track, maybe it's e-sports, like it could be any of those things or none of those things.

705
01:15:24,368 --> 01:15:24,828
Or theater.

706
01:15:25,289 --> 01:15:25,669
What's that?

707
01:15:25,809 --> 01:15:26,289
Or theater.

708
01:15:26,590 --> 01:15:28,071
Or theater, all the things, right?

709
01:15:28,471 --> 01:15:42,442
And so how do we try to pay a little bit of mind to that part of the educational experience as well is something that I think when we talk about climate and culture at the high school, that all sort of wraps together for me.

710
01:15:42,562 --> 01:15:47,306
And I want to see us make some progress on that in the next year, year and a half.

711
01:15:48,507 --> 01:15:48,887
Thank you.

712
01:15:49,468 --> 01:15:49,809
Thank you.

713
01:15:49,949 --> 01:15:52,151
Thank you member Graham every stone tour.

714
01:15:52,212 --> 01:15:59,380
Thank you for connecting with everyone over the last week that's great to reach out to the formal and the rec department, I'm excited about them starting a youth track program.

715
01:16:00,121 --> 01:16:07,991
And I'm just wondering is there coach app or job website for coaches specifically I know it's posted on NPS.

716
01:16:08,763 --> 01:16:12,406
And is it posted on school spring or spring school yet?

717
01:16:12,786 --> 01:16:14,528
I don't know that it's posted on school spring.

718
01:16:15,108 --> 01:16:18,270
I do know that we post to frontline.

719
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:27,357
And the head coaching position while approved is not posted yet, but will be with great speed and haste.

720
01:16:27,858 --> 01:16:30,240
So there's just one hurdle.

721
01:16:31,092 --> 01:16:34,814
no pun intended for us for us to get over with that.

722
01:16:35,494 --> 01:16:35,835
Okay.

723
01:16:35,975 --> 01:16:39,116
And is it that you've looked and there's no, I don't know about coaches.

724
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:42,078
I just don't imagine there would be a specific coaching.

725
01:16:42,278 --> 01:16:45,440
No, the MIA has some, but it's not well used.

726
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:47,741
It's, it's generally speaking close to school spring.

727
01:16:48,121 --> 01:16:53,264
I'm also going to reach out to Dave McGill for sports enterprises, um, because he has a broad reach.

728
01:16:53,946 --> 01:16:57,710
And so my hope is that he will be able to do that.

729
01:16:57,870 --> 01:17:03,876
I also know that other schools and districts use their booster clubs.

730
01:17:04,057 --> 01:17:10,383
I'm not saying that we have a track booster club, but this is something to think about to the future, that the district can only really support X number of coaches.

731
01:17:10,443 --> 01:17:13,106
This is a real problem, especially when it comes to football and hockey.

732
01:17:13,526 --> 01:17:16,009
So they can only support one or two or three coaches.

733
01:17:17,004 --> 01:17:19,106
because then it just becomes inequitable for other sports.

734
01:17:19,166 --> 01:17:30,136
But they look to their booster clubs to essentially stipend or give honorariums to volunteer coaches, but at least it's a little bit of something.

735
01:17:31,256 --> 01:17:39,163
But the people who spoke last week and the people who emailed you were on target with what they said about the stipends.

736
01:17:39,664 --> 01:17:40,684
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

737
01:17:41,465 --> 01:17:42,206
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

738
01:17:50,811 --> 01:17:52,072
We're gonna move on to number six.

739
01:17:52,392 --> 01:17:54,894
Seems like there's no more hands raised.

740
01:17:56,635 --> 01:18:01,118
Number six is report on Medford Public Schools budget process for fiscal year 24.

741
01:18:01,158 --> 01:18:03,000
Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, superintendent.

742
01:18:14,768 --> 01:18:15,649
So good evening.

743
01:18:15,809 --> 01:18:17,850
I'm going to be presenting

744
01:18:23,803 --> 01:18:25,844
the FY 24 budget update.

745
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:30,385
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

746
01:18:32,285 --> 01:18:46,569
And so to start to kick off our budget process for this year and talk about our timeline, I just wanted to take a moment to go through the slide deck with you.

747
01:18:47,809 --> 01:18:49,110
You can advance Dr. Cushing.

748
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:49,590
Thank you.

749
01:18:51,303 --> 01:18:56,946
So for last year in June of 22, our operating budget was $68,994,776.

750
01:19:04,270 --> 01:19:21,248
And as you can see, our wonderful students, our wonderful programming here in Medford, our arts, our teachers, our students actively learning, engaged, involved in, looks like an art class, and

751
01:19:23,752 --> 01:19:33,978
The money that we use, the money that we use to run the district is to provide our students first and foremost with the best quality education possible.

752
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:48,766
The next slide takes that 68.9 million and it kind of just gives you a general breakdown of how that money is divided up.

753
01:19:48,786 --> 01:19:48,766
53.7%, 54%.

754
01:19:55,038 --> 01:19:59,241
is allocated toward general education.

755
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:05,186
9.1% is allocated towards security and maintenance.

756
01:20:05,206 --> 01:20:10,030
25% is allocated towards special education.

757
01:20:12,291 --> 01:20:16,474
Student services equal 5.25% and administration is 6% of that pie.

758
01:20:24,124 --> 01:20:25,184
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

759
01:20:26,845 --> 01:20:31,066
I just wanna share a few numbers.

760
01:20:31,266 --> 01:20:36,627
Do you want us to hold questions to the end or when we'll have to flip all the way back the slide deck?

761
01:20:37,127 --> 01:20:38,188
I don't care either way.

762
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:41,629
Do you mind to hold?

763
01:20:41,729 --> 01:20:47,230
And then, cause I may end up answering a question on a future slide, it's possible.

764
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:49,130
And then we'll go back.

765
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:51,151
And I have a hard copy with me as well.

766
01:20:53,208 --> 01:21:00,110
So right in front of you right now what the slide is showing is our ESSER estimated budget for this year.

767
01:21:01,191 --> 01:21:06,612
And it talks about some of the key investments that we made under personnel, engagement specialists.

768
01:21:07,313 --> 01:21:13,935
We had 1.05 engagement specialists, one school nurse, floating nurse.

769
01:21:14,815 --> 01:21:29,024
three behavioral specialists, reading specialists, ELL newcomer instructor, contractual stipends, professional learning, literacy, Hill for Literacy, responsive classroom.

770
01:21:30,964 --> 01:21:34,767
Camp Mustang, we have that as a TBD.

771
01:21:35,908 --> 01:21:41,151
Our MBTA pass program currently right now is about $15,000 a month.

772
01:21:41,631 --> 01:21:47,255
So for the 10 months, that's 150,000 coming out of ESSER funding.

773
01:21:49,617 --> 01:21:52,399
Emergency connectivity fund, there was an additional 90,000.

774
01:21:54,940 --> 01:22:16,803
And then under miscellaneous cell counseling programs, our rebus professional development training for our administrators, talking points and other subscriptions, that was approximately $50,000 that we spent on ESSER funding for this year, estimated budget.

775
01:22:25,669 --> 01:22:37,024
So moving forward to fiscal year 24 for next school year, you see before you four key priorities which are aligned to our strategic plan.

776
01:22:39,341 --> 01:22:50,125
Implementing curricula, which you heard earlier about our literacy presentation, there are important shifts in curricular investments that need to be made.

777
01:22:52,205 --> 01:22:57,267
Looking at assessment, instructional strategies to support all of our students.

778
01:22:58,328 --> 01:23:06,570
Our second priority is going to be focusing on building culture through community engagement and fostering collaboration.

779
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:08,111
Our third

780
01:23:09,107 --> 01:23:19,731
priority equity, but looking at equitably supporting the academic, the social emotional learning needs and physical needs of all of our students.

781
01:23:20,471 --> 01:23:32,036
And our fourth priority would be looking at school infrastructure, student supports and safety of creating a safe learning environment for all of our learners.

782
01:23:32,896 --> 01:23:42,303
So those are kind of the buckets that we're going to be focusing on as key priorities which are all aligned to our strategic plan.

783
01:23:44,992 --> 01:23:57,439
And to go a little deeper on, again, this slide, which is showing next year FY24 budgetary priorities, we will be sending out a budget survey.

784
01:23:58,619 --> 01:24:01,261
And there's an asterisk next to the word needs.

785
01:24:01,501 --> 01:24:06,363
And at the bottom, it says it reflects the preliminary information.

786
01:24:07,104 --> 01:24:09,805
So we do not yet have the survey.

787
01:24:10,246 --> 01:24:12,347
The surveys have not gone out as of yet.

788
01:24:12,987 --> 01:24:22,192
But as we receive the survey data, as that data comes in, it will also help to shift our budgetary priorities.

789
01:24:22,672 --> 01:24:24,193
But this is just a draft.

790
01:24:25,354 --> 01:24:31,637
We're still looking heavily at strategic staffing investments focused on our most vulnerable learners.

791
01:24:33,072 --> 01:24:36,394
professional development and training, which is critically important.

792
01:24:37,595 --> 01:24:42,157
We're investing in talking about spending hundreds of thousands of dollars.

793
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:50,762
In the literacy program alone, it's estimated to cost about 600,000, which will appear in a later slide.

794
01:24:51,222 --> 01:24:56,786
But to spend that kind of money, more than a half million dollars, and not include

795
01:24:57,806 --> 01:25:05,892
professional development for our educators, it doesn't make sense to bring in such an expensive program and not provide the training.

796
01:25:06,452 --> 01:25:13,798
So professional development and training is critically important for our academic success here in Medford.

797
01:25:14,518 --> 01:25:22,764
Also, we want to continue with district-wide professional development on restorative practices, responsive classroom,

798
01:25:24,325 --> 01:25:28,947
and further curriculum training for the elementary math and literacy.

799
01:25:29,067 --> 01:25:39,871
And as we continue to look at other programs, such as the HECAT program, any other programs that we may be thinking about bringing on board.

800
01:25:41,181 --> 01:25:45,325
In terms of summer programming, it's something that we do feel is very important.

801
01:25:46,085 --> 01:25:50,389
We know that there is significant cost with that.

802
01:25:50,429 --> 01:26:05,903
So we are looking at pursuing grant opportunities to continue several summer programming options for our community here in Medford, from literacy to math,

803
01:26:06,423 --> 01:26:14,002
to finance to sell programming during the summer, and then a few miscellaneous.

804
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:21,379
supplements that we will need as part of the newly negotiated contract.

805
01:26:21,939 --> 01:26:36,685
We will be working on the high school scheduling, which is finally fully merging the vocational school schedule and the comprehensive school schedule, having the two schedules talk

806
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:42,248
and be aligned because we still have the five day, six day schedule.

807
01:26:42,749 --> 01:26:44,930
So it's a lot of force fitting.

808
01:26:45,430 --> 01:27:02,542
And so we agreed to have a consultant come in to support us with the high school scheduling and at the elementary level where we have also shifted where our elementary schools will be having the additional early release half days.

809
01:27:03,442 --> 01:27:07,005
So for that, we had to do some shifting.

810
01:27:07,025 --> 01:27:15,914
The meetings are still taking place, but for elementary scheduling, we will need to have a slight increase in staffing.

811
01:27:16,014 --> 01:27:24,541
So where elementary scheduling is concerned in order to make the new schedule work for all of our students.

812
01:27:25,722 --> 01:27:27,244
That's something that we're aware of.

813
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:29,125
So we just wanted to put that down.

814
01:27:29,525 --> 01:27:40,213
Again, it's a draft, but just for you to start kind of chewing on some of the ideas that we wanna put forward during this budget process.

815
01:27:41,034 --> 01:27:42,235
Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

816
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:52,068
I also want to just highlight a few FY 24 initial budget drivers.

817
01:27:52,989 --> 01:27:58,172
We are currently, we have four collective bargaining agreements that we're still working on.

818
01:27:59,973 --> 01:28:10,640
We have potential unanticipated maintenance costs where, you know, I shared with the committee, you know, that the high school has a lot of,

819
01:28:14,702 --> 01:28:19,067
old pipes and, you know, freezing and just different things that have happened.

820
01:28:20,048 --> 01:28:30,160
So we've, we've been dealing with several unanticipated maintenance expenses and we know that those kind of kinds of expenses will continue to pop up.

821
01:28:31,221 --> 01:28:34,385
So we just have that listed there for something to really

822
01:28:36,761 --> 01:28:38,783
keep top of mind.

823
01:28:39,123 --> 01:28:52,634
I also want to share that out of district tuition costs for FY 24, we are expecting a significant increase of 14%.

824
01:28:53,795 --> 01:28:56,337
This is not exclusive to Medford Public Schools.

825
01:28:56,377 --> 01:29:02,022
This is across the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts that all districts

826
01:29:02,682 --> 01:29:12,408
have been notified to expect an increase of 14% for special education out of district tuitions.

827
01:29:13,129 --> 01:29:18,932
And so that is a significant increase in one year to be able to

828
01:29:21,354 --> 01:29:43,252
make the necessary adjustments but I just again wanted to put this out before the committee for you to be aware that this is a new piece of information that all districts are dealing with and I do believe that there's been a lot of legislation and working with members of the delegation to try to see if something can be done

829
01:29:43,972 --> 01:29:54,036
with that number of 14%, but as of right now, the communication that did go out to all districts is that that number is expect a 14% increase.

830
01:29:54,616 --> 01:29:58,637
So we're also keeping that in mind.

831
01:30:00,658 --> 01:30:06,026
And there are also just ordinary anticipated financial challenges that may come along.

832
01:30:06,046 --> 01:30:14,938
In Medford we were hoping to be able to add a theater teacher, a 1.0 that is one period that

833
01:30:18,122 --> 01:30:25,866
one position that we were thinking about trying to add, but again, we have the wonderful theater, we wanna make use of that.

834
01:30:26,466 --> 01:30:37,272
I did mention on the previous slide about the high school and elementary school schedule consultancy, that's critically important and it was negotiated in the CBA.

835
01:30:37,372 --> 01:30:46,737
So it's something that we must work on to make sure that we're in compliance with our CBA.

836
01:30:47,657 --> 01:30:56,722
And then we're looking at augmented bus transportation costs to plan for high school yellow bus routes.

837
01:30:57,422 --> 01:31:05,326
If that's something that still ends up being part of where we land when it's all said and done.

838
01:31:08,878 --> 01:31:23,667
Moving on, for next year, it's critically important that our proposed final ESSER budget next year, FY24, is the final year of ESSER.

839
01:31:24,387 --> 01:31:27,729
We have approximately $3 million left.

840
01:31:28,349 --> 01:31:30,411
This is the final rollout of ESSER.

841
01:31:31,651 --> 01:31:35,894
And there are a few items that are already listed.

842
01:31:38,995 --> 01:31:47,817
The curriculum for the new elementary literacy program is approximately $600,000, which I said earlier in the presentation.

843
01:31:47,837 --> 01:31:47,877
Ms.

844
01:31:50,678 --> 01:31:55,018
Galussi and the literacy team, they have pursued a grant.

845
01:31:56,019 --> 01:32:00,680
If that grant, if we are able to secure that grant, it's for $300,000.

846
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,863
which would be a significant grant.

847
01:32:05,003 --> 01:32:06,225
And as Ms.

848
01:32:06,245 --> 01:32:09,810
Galussi mentioned, it's already at the governor's desk.

849
01:32:10,271 --> 01:32:14,056
So we are keeping our fingers crossed and really hoping that that is good news.

850
01:32:14,557 --> 01:32:17,742
So that number there of approximately 600,000 would be cut in half.

851
01:32:20,356 --> 01:32:25,018
The restorative justice and the bystander intervention.

852
01:32:25,058 --> 01:32:28,140
This is training that we would love to have at the secondary level.

853
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:42,288
It is approximately $100,000 for literacy, which we've been working with partnering with them for multiple years, helping us with rollout of literacy instruction.

854
01:32:43,828 --> 01:32:45,510
Their programming is approximately 90,000.

855
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:53,455
So those three pieces would be potentially coming out of ESSER monies.

856
01:32:54,396 --> 01:33:02,622
And the $250,000, the balance of the elementary math program, that's the remainder of what is due.

857
01:33:04,383 --> 01:33:06,505
Those monies came out of our general fund.

858
01:33:07,085 --> 01:33:09,687
So just so you're aware, that 250,000 came out of the general fund.

859
01:33:13,049 --> 01:33:18,013
So these are just proposed costs for the 3 million.

860
01:33:18,373 --> 01:33:24,297
And as you can see, just in some of the programming, it could be nearly $1 million.

861
01:33:26,258 --> 01:33:36,865
So for FY 24 planning, some additional planning that we're doing, we have some wonderful, happy students sharing, telling us that they can be the best you can be.

862
01:33:39,107 --> 01:33:41,088
We have to still think about transportation.

863
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:49,725
the summer of 23 planning, which I mentioned a little bit earlier, the governor's budget proposal.

864
01:33:49,745 --> 01:33:53,929
We know that that is pending, but we're going to be working with that.

865
01:33:54,149 --> 01:33:57,312
And then we're going to be scheduling committee of the holes.

866
01:33:58,873 --> 01:34:06,740
On the final slide, we have a tentative timetable

867
01:34:10,872 --> 01:34:13,513
Our strategic planning goals were approved in June of 2022.

868
01:34:13,774 --> 01:34:21,837
And we will be sending out budget surveys between March 7th and 17th.

869
01:34:21,857 --> 01:34:32,082
We're doing a 10 day window with the budget surveys to gather data and look at that data and see what is available for us.

870
01:34:33,022 --> 01:34:37,304
Budget meetings falling between March 28th and April 25th.

871
01:34:40,513 --> 01:34:52,541
recommendations to the committee for me around May 1st, May 15th, approximately, school committee requests.

872
01:34:54,623 --> 01:34:58,666
And the municipal appropriation, we know what that is in June TBD.

873
01:35:00,658 --> 01:35:01,979
school committee adoption.

874
01:35:02,619 --> 01:35:12,289
We have two meetings which are on the 5th and the 12th of June and implementation of this budget would take place on July 1.

875
01:35:14,211 --> 01:35:22,879
So this is just an overview to hopefully whet your appetites and I'm ready to take any questions.

876
01:35:23,139 --> 01:35:23,540
Thank you.

877
01:35:24,341 --> 01:35:24,621
Thank you.

878
01:35:25,592 --> 01:35:26,712
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

879
01:35:26,812 --> 01:35:40,575
And I know this came with a tentative timeline, so I suggest that all my colleagues let Dr. Edward-Vincent and the team know when you're available, when you aren't based on that timeline so we can create a final document.

880
01:35:41,055 --> 01:35:42,096
Member Rousseau?

881
01:35:42,856 --> 01:35:43,216
Thank you.

882
01:35:43,896 --> 01:35:45,496
I have a couple of questions.

883
01:35:46,577 --> 01:35:48,357
One was on the slide with the

884
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:50,090
FY23 budget.

885
01:35:50,210 --> 01:36:02,313
Are those numbers representative of the portion of that $68 million, or do those include things like grants or special education funding that comes in a year late?

886
01:36:02,433 --> 01:36:06,934
The pie grant was reflective of the $68 million operating budget.

887
01:36:07,274 --> 01:36:10,355
It was not showing all of the other grants.

888
01:36:10,875 --> 01:36:11,075
Great.

889
01:36:11,115 --> 01:36:11,435
Thank you.

890
01:36:12,912 --> 01:36:26,650
When we do the bus contract, I feel like we keep talking about busing and the contracts here and then it happens and then we're just showing the contract to sign as as if we're not the other person signing it.

891
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:29,834
And I understand we essentially live in a no bid

892
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:34,719
there's no bids for the bus contract.

893
01:36:34,759 --> 01:36:36,020
There's the bus company.

894
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:42,242
It's this de facto monopoly that the state somehow and the federal government have not cared much about.

895
01:36:42,402 --> 01:36:47,824
But we have things that this committee wants to change in our bus contract.

896
01:36:48,084 --> 01:36:51,706
And I think we should have that conversation before there's a new contract that's drafted.

897
01:36:52,666 --> 01:36:54,587
So I don't mean to add yet another meeting,

898
01:36:56,275 --> 01:37:04,138
our opinions on the bus contract and what needs to be different so that a negotiating position is actually approved from the committee.

899
01:37:06,439 --> 01:37:09,200
Seems like we should really have that this year.

900
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:24,346
So great minds think alike member Rousseau, because today prepping with the team, we were talking about providing a bus contract update at the March 20th meeting, am I correct Dr. Cushing?

901
01:37:25,106 --> 01:37:39,491
And we're working closely with Fiona here at City Hall so we are those talks have already begun preliminary conversations and that was one of the things that we said we know that it's.

902
01:37:40,191 --> 01:37:51,417
You know we wanted to list it so that you're aware as just all of the things that were, you know, taking all of these pieces and starting to just chunk them and say, you know what are going to be our huge priorities.

903
01:37:51,917 --> 01:37:55,019
So we do want to get that before the committee.

904
01:37:55,879 --> 01:37:59,540
to be able to just focus in on the transportation piece.

905
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:04,281
So we did want to have a report to present at our next regular meeting.

906
01:38:05,062 --> 01:38:16,385
And if after that presentation, you know, the committee decides they would like a committee of the whole or a different specific meeting, then we definitely would be more than willing to do that.

907
01:38:16,905 --> 01:38:17,625
Great, thank you.

908
01:38:17,665 --> 01:38:19,726
And then my last question should be quicker.

909
01:38:20,926 --> 01:38:47,140
I don't know if it was the last budget or the budget before they do run together, but when the city allocation came in at the last minute, it was last year, and the amount of money, it might not have been last year, forgive me, whichever year it was, the superintendent's office went off to figure out how to cut a bunch of money because the allocation and the approved budget were not the same number.

910
01:38:48,683 --> 01:38:56,129
you all worked like round the clock all weekend long to get that done, but the committee was not involved.

911
01:38:57,610 --> 01:39:03,655
And I just think, you know, last year there was our vote for the municipal appropriation.

912
01:39:05,697 --> 01:39:08,219
We split it out into the appropriate votes last year.

913
01:39:09,820 --> 01:39:16,185
And I just want to reiterate how important it is that we do not have us approving a budget and then

914
01:39:17,719 --> 01:39:30,101
you being asked to spend the weekend with your staff in a bunker chopping, if that's the situation we're in, without the committee having something to say about it, because we are supposed to have something to say about that.

915
01:39:30,322 --> 01:39:32,582
So I just want to reiterate how important that is.

916
01:39:33,002 --> 01:39:46,765
I have no idea what the budget's going to look like, but if that happens, I don't want to find out that you got rid of a director of something and you did all these other things in the dead of the night without us having a say in the matter.

917
01:39:46,825 --> 01:39:47,525
So thank you.

918
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:50,181
Thank you member Russo, I can answer that.

919
01:39:50,842 --> 01:39:57,807
Last year was a tough time because we didn't have CFO for many months, 11 months to be exact.

920
01:39:58,107 --> 01:40:06,453
Currently we have a full-time CFO and a new budget director working diligently on the city budget and forecasting.

921
01:40:06,493 --> 01:40:10,716
So we should have a number of schools within the next several weeks.

922
01:40:12,657 --> 01:40:12,837
Yes.

923
01:40:14,438 --> 01:40:15,299
It's very good news.

924
01:40:17,571 --> 01:40:18,252
Good news for now.

925
01:40:20,834 --> 01:40:30,402
The last two years, three years, we've cut from the stabilized, tried to go even on the city side so that we could give it the most we could to the schools.

926
01:40:30,522 --> 01:40:32,143
Obviously there comes a breaking point.

927
01:40:32,283 --> 01:40:36,767
So I think we're somewhat at that, but we'll do our best to give as much of an increase as we can.

928
01:40:38,389 --> 01:40:41,111
And we have this year and next year that we are able to use

929
01:40:42,129 --> 01:40:43,971
funding to plug any gaps.

930
01:40:44,011 --> 01:40:45,672
Last year we used about $7 million.

931
01:40:45,773 --> 01:40:47,054
It needs to be decreased.

932
01:40:47,234 --> 01:40:56,342
And then eventually after there's no more opera money, that's when we have to, we're already doing forecasting to project what, if any, of an override we would need.

933
01:40:57,483 --> 01:40:58,724
Member McLaughlin?

934
01:40:58,824 --> 01:40:59,545
Yes, thank you.

935
01:41:02,047 --> 01:41:08,112
I was just looking at the schedule, superintendent, for the virtual listening sessions on April 27th.

936
01:41:10,151 --> 01:41:21,197
And I'm wondering if that's one session you're planning on having or more than one session and if there will be session or I would like to suggest that there be sessions with interpreters available.

937
01:41:24,141 --> 01:41:26,983
Thank you, Madam McLaughlin, I can do that.

938
01:41:27,003 --> 01:41:40,491
Again, I wanted to get a draft schedule out to the members to at least have an idea of when the request was made to set the timetable forward.

939
01:41:40,891 --> 01:41:51,378
So we can definitely do that with translations and have additional, yes, yes.

940
01:41:58,357 --> 01:41:58,778
thank you.

941
01:42:00,659 --> 01:42:05,501
April 18 is during school vacation week.

942
01:42:06,142 --> 01:42:06,582
Thank you.

943
01:42:06,922 --> 01:42:07,642
Thank you for that.

944
01:42:08,563 --> 01:42:11,825
Um and I guess I was looking at sort of the cadence of meetings.

945
01:42:11,865 --> 01:42:16,987
So, there's like four planned budget hearings on our list.

946
01:42:17,468 --> 01:42:23,611
Um I think we could probably like do it in three if they are not attached to other like

947
01:42:25,964 --> 01:42:33,594
You may not need to find, in my opinion, you might not need to find a replacement for that meeting if the sequence of topics can shift.

948
01:42:33,634 --> 01:42:40,362
I can't imagine that we could spend an entire meeting talking about the increase of the out-of-district tuition.

949
01:42:42,531 --> 01:42:52,384
It is, it is true right and so there's probably like lots of opportunity for us to talk about other things so that line up with the priorities that we will all share with you.

950
01:42:53,005 --> 01:42:56,409
So I think, you know, maybe we don't need for maybe three is fine.

951
01:42:58,399 --> 01:43:00,101
And that would be fine.

952
01:43:00,201 --> 01:43:14,153
I think the virtual listening session, is that the same as the budget hearing that we are required to have as a school committee by law about the budget, or that is something separate completely?

953
01:43:15,174 --> 01:43:21,937
This one in April, I was thinking the official budget hearing would either be the late May, early June.

954
01:43:21,957 --> 01:43:26,479
Normally we do it closer to the end.

955
01:43:26,979 --> 01:43:39,385
This virtual listening session was more to like give the community or other people an opportunity to see what direction are we moving in and then we will have the survey data.

956
01:43:39,925 --> 01:43:43,087
So it's just another opportunity to receive feedback.

957
01:43:43,769 --> 01:43:44,009
Okay.

958
01:43:44,710 --> 01:43:52,638
Um, and that, so I think the only other thing that we should try to do on this schedule is identify when that like statutory budget hearing is going to happen.

959
01:43:53,358 --> 01:43:57,643
Um, it can, I think it can happen at a regular school committee meeting as long as it's posted.

960
01:43:58,103 --> 01:44:00,906
So maybe may 15th is the right time to do that.

961
01:44:01,306 --> 01:44:05,690
Um, or it's just like where in the calendar that falls so that we don't lose sight of it.

962
01:44:06,954 --> 01:44:18,983
I'll mark the May 15th date as the... So then people will have an opportunity to go to the listening sessions and participate in these meetings all along.

963
01:44:19,043 --> 01:44:22,546
And then that can be the formal hearing.

964
01:44:22,626 --> 01:44:25,188
You're saying within the regular meeting or do a COW?

965
01:44:26,249 --> 01:44:27,410
I think it could go either way.

966
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:28,811
I think it just has to be noticed.

967
01:44:29,031 --> 01:44:31,433
I think it's actually a specific special meeting.

968
01:44:31,553 --> 01:44:33,194
It's not part of the regular meeting.

969
01:44:33,955 --> 01:44:34,896
It's not a COW either.

970
01:44:37,045 --> 01:44:37,265
meeting.

971
01:44:39,806 --> 01:44:49,933
And if I may, I think also that has to happen prior to our vote, which I'm reading is the 15th.

972
01:44:50,073 --> 01:44:54,956
Is that when we would vote on our request?

973
01:44:56,087 --> 01:44:59,609
Well, our approval of the final budget is not until June.

974
01:44:59,749 --> 01:45:04,633
So there's like the request and then there's actually like approving the budget, right?

975
01:45:04,773 --> 01:45:06,734
So there's two steps in our process.

976
01:45:07,675 --> 01:45:18,382
And I don't know that the law says specifically like, cause the budget isn't approved until it is a real number, right?

977
01:45:19,182 --> 01:45:20,943
Or not approvable until it's a real number.

978
01:45:21,003 --> 01:45:22,664
Our request is just a request.

979
01:45:22,785 --> 01:45:24,946
If I recall how we handled it last time.

980
01:45:32,093 --> 01:45:32,373
Thank you.

981
01:45:33,354 --> 01:45:33,594
Thank you.

982
01:45:33,914 --> 01:45:34,334
Thank you.

983
01:45:34,354 --> 01:45:34,955
Okay.

984
01:45:34,995 --> 01:45:38,917
So anybody will note any dates, just like, um, school vacation week.

985
01:45:38,997 --> 01:45:39,858
I noted that as well.

986
01:45:39,938 --> 01:45:41,299
So a few of us picked up on that.

987
01:45:41,659 --> 01:45:43,800
Um, and then we'll get those to the superintendent.

988
01:45:44,261 --> 01:45:47,403
Thank you for the presentation and, um, love the pictures.

989
01:45:48,383 --> 01:45:49,444
Um, we have presentations.

990
01:45:49,464 --> 01:45:51,845
We do not have any presentations of the public.

991
01:45:51,865 --> 01:46:00,591
So we'll go on to continue business number, um, 12 based on the February 6th, 2023 committee of the whole meeting.

992
01:46:01,220 --> 01:46:04,481
The Medford School Committee shall develop their goals for the remainder of this year.

993
01:46:04,681 --> 01:46:12,023
Moving forward, the Medford School Committee will develop their goals and objectives for an 11 month cycle, starting in January and ending in November of calendar year.

994
01:46:12,724 --> 01:46:16,345
Motion was tabled on March 6th, 2023 by member of a stone.

995
01:46:17,665 --> 01:46:22,147
We are taking it up again tonight because we are at a reasonable hour.

996
01:46:22,827 --> 01:46:24,067
So who would like to start?

997
01:46:24,187 --> 01:46:24,907
Member McLaughlin.

998
01:46:25,448 --> 01:46:25,788
Thank you.

999
01:46:28,108 --> 01:46:28,429
Thank you.

1000
01:46:30,787 --> 01:46:43,731
make a motion that one of the goals for the school committee be regarding equity, in particular access for all families to school committee business.

1001
01:46:45,592 --> 01:46:58,877
Specifically, I would recommend that we make a goal of being able to have translated materials of the school committee meetings and at least two to three, excuse me, and at least two to three

1002
01:47:01,732 --> 01:47:12,800
perhaps three meetings over the course of the year that are similar to like a town hall with interpretation and offered in perhaps multiple languages.

1003
01:47:12,820 --> 01:47:14,201
There's a number of ways that it can be done.

1004
01:47:14,221 --> 01:47:26,930
I know that it's done in a number of organizations, but I would really like my colleagues to consider equity as one of our goals that can be accounted for come next year, where we can demonstrate that we've,

1005
01:47:28,543 --> 01:47:41,250
had some thoughtfulness around what equity actually should look like and how we can start moving that forward as I know it's one of the primary goals for the superintendent as well.

1006
01:47:41,350 --> 01:47:42,150
Dr. Edward-Vincent?

1007
01:47:42,451 --> 01:47:44,632
Yes, Linda McLaughlin.

1008
01:47:44,652 --> 01:47:49,835
I'm just asking for a little greater clarity.

1009
01:47:50,135 --> 01:47:52,616
I guess I'm trying to make sure I'm following.

1010
01:47:53,117 --> 01:47:56,078
You would like school committee documents

1011
01:47:57,399 --> 01:48:02,884
Translated or we're saying to hold special meetings with translation available.

1012
01:48:03,165 --> 01:48:08,970
I, yes, so one of the things is it just so for edification for the public in the community as well.

1013
01:48:09,351 --> 01:48:14,215
Translation is material so that's print document interpretation is word spoken.

1014
01:48:14,896 --> 01:48:21,362
So I'm looking for to, I'm looking for, you know, and they don't have to be all of the materials at once I know that there's a, there's a.

1015
01:48:22,843 --> 01:48:39,995
a cost involved, so I would like to say that, but frankly, also anyone that's receiving federal funding is really required to be translating materials, so I want us to really set a goal for having translated material and, in addition, having at least a minimum of three

1016
01:48:43,294 --> 01:48:53,819
town halls, committee of the hall meetings, whatever you want to call them, with interpretation using our two highest use languages in the community.

1017
01:48:55,080 --> 01:48:56,861
May I ask a further clarification?

1018
01:48:58,921 --> 01:49:05,084
Can we just maybe edit it to say increase translating materials.

1019
01:49:06,225 --> 01:49:11,748
I just know on the city side, we are making great strides and translating more, but it is,

1020
01:49:13,212 --> 01:49:15,034
something that is just taking some time.

1021
01:49:15,574 --> 01:49:23,760
But as you do different types of materials, I think it's costly, but also time consuming.

1022
01:49:23,780 --> 01:49:28,903
So I just don't wanna put that on us to push onto the administration to translate everything all at once.

1023
01:49:29,003 --> 01:49:30,404
I think it just needs to be gradual.

1024
01:49:31,725 --> 01:49:33,527
So we don't set ourselves up for failure.

1025
01:49:35,008 --> 01:49:38,390
Yes, and so I'm willing to say a certain percentage with the goal of increasing

1026
01:49:39,898 --> 01:49:42,559
each year, so I would defer to my colleagues about that.

1027
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:50,543
But I would also say that I wasn't necessarily assuming that the district would be translating material.

1028
01:49:50,623 --> 01:49:56,006
I was assuming potentially it was a budget line item where material is being translated for the district because

1029
01:49:56,621 --> 01:49:58,161
It's something, again, that is required.

1030
01:49:58,181 --> 01:50:00,702
If we're receiving federal funding, it's something that is required.

1031
01:50:00,762 --> 01:50:10,965
So, I mean, that's up to the district and the superintendent to decide how they wanna think about this, but I really think it's past time to be thinking about it.

1032
01:50:11,425 --> 01:50:17,367
And I would really encourage my colleagues to consider this as one of the goals that we really wanna focus on.

1033
01:50:17,407 --> 01:50:18,387
And I do hear you, Mayor.

1034
01:50:18,787 --> 01:50:19,888
I don't think, you know,

1035
01:50:22,035 --> 01:50:23,256
everything everywhere all at once.

1036
01:50:23,336 --> 01:50:29,698
Like I don't think, you know, but I think having measurable goals and benchmarks around this would be really important.

1037
01:50:29,818 --> 01:50:33,120
So I would like to open that dialogue up with the committee.

1038
01:50:33,160 --> 01:50:33,540
Thank you.

1039
01:50:34,940 --> 01:50:35,441
Member Hayes.

1040
01:50:36,521 --> 01:50:39,962
I just wanted some further clarification too about the town hall meetings.

1041
01:50:40,022 --> 01:50:48,366
I'm not, I'm unclear whether you're talking about specific topics or you're talking about, I'm not sure what you're talking about with town hall meetings.

1042
01:50:49,324 --> 01:50:49,544
Sure.

1043
01:50:49,564 --> 01:51:02,061
I think in general, a lot of our community are that are not English speaking as a primary language, perhaps don't understand the function of the school committee don't understand how it operates don't understand any of those things.

1044
01:51:02,561 --> 01:51:04,945
So as opposed to having just a committee meeting.

1045
01:51:05,425 --> 01:51:15,071
a typical general committee meeting that is then translated, I think it might be better to have a topical, like two or three topical meetings that are then translated.

1046
01:51:15,111 --> 01:51:17,612
Of course, they would have to be public meetings, they're committee meetings.

1047
01:51:18,312 --> 01:51:23,155
They could be considered committee of the whole, town hall, what have you, but it could be topical.

1048
01:51:23,315 --> 01:51:24,996
What is the school committee and how does it work?

1049
01:51:25,396 --> 01:51:27,378
How can you get involved with your children's schools?

1050
01:51:28,558 --> 01:51:31,520
Any number of topics, but I would say a minimum of three.

1051
01:51:33,169 --> 01:51:38,874
with, you know, specifically with the guidance on, I know that Haitian Creole is one of our primary languages.

1052
01:51:38,914 --> 01:51:57,809
I don't know what the second highest spoken language would be in the district, but I would really focus on, I guess, the first two with maybe, three might be ambitious for town halls or meetings, but maybe two meetings between now and when we set our goals next time that are really meetings to build

1053
01:51:58,690 --> 01:52:00,291
it's also community engagement.

1054
01:52:00,311 --> 01:52:04,995
So it's not just equity, it's under the community engagement goal as well, to build community engagement.

1055
01:52:05,035 --> 01:52:13,741
I mean, our demographics on our high school and our other schools are very clear that we have, I think, what did we say last year at graduation?

1056
01:52:13,761 --> 01:52:18,524
Something like 300 different countries represented at graduation, which is fantastic.

1057
01:52:18,884 --> 01:52:22,887
But I think there's a lot of families out there that we're not necessarily reaching.

1058
01:52:22,947 --> 01:52:25,469
So in response to that, I guess I would say topical.

1059
01:52:29,719 --> 01:52:40,891
So we'll scratch the wording town hall, because town hall maybe is more of a question and answer type open public meeting for everybody to come and ask any question on anything.

1060
01:52:40,931 --> 01:52:41,932
That's what I think of a town hall.

1061
01:52:41,972 --> 01:52:44,074
I don't know what else my colleagues think.

1062
01:52:44,415 --> 01:52:50,141
So you're thinking maybe like one of our final budget meeting would be?

1063
01:52:50,261 --> 01:52:50,321
No.

1064
01:52:50,836 --> 01:52:50,996
No.

1065
01:52:51,557 --> 01:53:06,970
And so this is really about opportunity for engagement and understanding so it's about building family relationship and in community and having interpretation so maybe it is a committee of the whole if you need a name for it, a committee of the whole or two committees of the whole.

1066
01:53:07,410 --> 01:53:26,055
where they are opportunities to have a discussion on a topical, whether it's how to get engaged with your schools, how to ask question and answers of your school committee, what is a school committee, how do you affect policy change if needed, any of those topics.

1067
01:53:26,095 --> 01:53:32,557
I mean, the topics I think can be decided, but I think the important piece is that we're opening a forum that offers

1068
01:53:33,838 --> 01:53:36,619
translation and people to understand the process.

1069
01:53:36,839 --> 01:53:37,859
So I don't care what we call it.

1070
01:53:38,059 --> 01:53:38,299
Got it.

1071
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:56,565
So could, can I make a suggestion from the chair, if my colleagues don't have anything to say, could we set the goal that we have one town hall in the fall that will give us a chance to get through the budget, let them, let the administration plan the town hall in the summer.

1072
01:53:57,265 --> 01:53:59,746
And we do it as a, just like we did

1073
01:54:00,503 --> 01:54:19,638
I think we did a couple meetings all through Zoom and then there was breakout rooms where there'll be the Haitian Creole breakout room, the Spanish, the Portuguese, and then anybody who's attending to ask any question from the district will have admin in each one and they can ask any question they have about the new school year.

1074
01:54:19,918 --> 01:54:23,141
So sometime in September, October, and we talk about the school year.

1075
01:54:25,399 --> 01:54:26,440
Certainly, that's one option.

1076
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:27,120
Thank you, Mayor.

1077
01:54:27,301 --> 01:54:28,181
That's certainly one option.

1078
01:54:28,201 --> 01:54:35,887
I mean, I just was at a conference on Saturday and did a presentation that was a simultaneous interpretation in Vietnamese.

1079
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:42,753
And so you can either do simultaneous interpretation where you stop and pause, or you can have the breakout rooms, like you said.

1080
01:54:43,293 --> 01:54:47,196
Even with the breakout rooms, you don't have to have administration in each of the breakout rooms.

1081
01:54:47,216 --> 01:54:52,881
You can actually have people listening in their language and the main meeting still happening.

1082
01:54:53,382 --> 01:54:57,423
and so that there are people listening in their language, but the main meeting is still happening.

1083
01:54:57,503 --> 01:55:07,685
Yeah, and so then we're still all part of the same meeting, because what I don't want is, no, I don't want people to go in other rooms with one administrator and talk, because that is sort of defeating the purpose.

1084
01:55:08,285 --> 01:55:17,667
I want us all to be part of, I think it is more like a town hall, because it's more of a sort of question and answer discussion, but it can be called whatever.

1085
01:55:17,687 --> 01:55:20,608
I think it would have to be facilitated, obviously, we wouldn't just have

1086
01:55:21,155 --> 01:55:31,942
you know, random questions or whatever would be facilitated and topical, but I do think it's an important step towards recognizing that we need to engage other communities.

1087
01:55:31,962 --> 01:55:50,215
So yeah, I'm fine with, again, a fall start if folks think that that makes sense, but I guess looking specifically at a goal, you know, we talked about having goals for the school committee and looking specifically at a goal that we can be held accountable for as school committee members, I would say, I would,

1088
01:55:51,252 --> 01:56:03,716
respectfully ask my colleagues to consider equity to be one of those goals and two measurable ways that we can achieve part of that goal between the time we have now and in January, when we would reestablish goals.

1089
01:56:03,756 --> 01:56:12,899
I think we said, I don't take me literally, I don't remember the exact date when we said we would do new goals, but that we would have equity in the way that we could, or that we would address equity.

1090
01:56:12,999 --> 01:56:16,020
And two of the ways that we would address that is one,

1091
01:56:16,727 --> 01:56:27,014
with an increase of a certain percentage of school committee materials being translated into at least one of our most popular languages.

1092
01:56:28,015 --> 01:56:36,921
And then to at least, you know, one to two for this year, because we're already on the short end, we, you know, we're already on the short end of setting the goal.

1093
01:56:36,981 --> 01:56:44,607
So for this year, I would say one to two town halls that are in the two primary languages or that offer

1094
01:56:45,103 --> 01:56:46,905
translation in the two primary languages.

1095
01:56:47,325 --> 01:56:48,666
I think we have three here in Medford.

1096
01:56:49,066 --> 01:56:49,487
What are they?

1097
01:56:51,749 --> 01:56:52,970
Portuguese, Spanish, and Haitian Creole.

1098
01:56:52,990 --> 01:56:53,930
Oh yes, Portuguese, right.

1099
01:56:53,990 --> 01:56:54,851
Spanish and Haitian Creole.

1100
01:56:54,891 --> 01:56:55,412
I'm almost positive.

1101
01:56:55,432 --> 01:56:55,812
Yeah, yeah.

1102
01:56:55,912 --> 01:56:57,273
So I think that would be a great example.

1103
01:56:57,613 --> 01:56:57,793
Great.

1104
01:56:57,894 --> 01:57:09,223
And it would actually be the superintendent that knows best because I think the city has learned from the Friday updates that come in multiple languages that has been a great asset to our families.

1105
01:57:10,534 --> 01:57:26,617
So goal number one, equity and access to all to increase translation of materials and to have one to two town halls, first one being in the fall with that is translated in the three most commonly used languages here in Medford.

1106
01:57:26,838 --> 01:57:27,418
Interpreted.

1107
01:57:27,878 --> 01:57:30,658
Interpreted in the three languages.

1108
01:57:32,279 --> 01:57:33,179
Member Ms.

1109
01:57:33,199 --> 01:57:34,139
Stone, you had to be late on first.

1110
01:57:34,179 --> 01:57:35,479
Is this on a second goal or on this?

1111
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:38,400
I can wait if you're going off.

1112
01:57:39,795 --> 01:58:08,907
So, as we're talking, I'm wondering if like to be really concrete, we could say that our goal starting in the fall is that the agendas will be translated so that people proactively can understand what's happening and that there's a mechanism for folks who may want to participate in our meeting to tell us that so that we can do what we can do to get services here.

1113
01:58:09,474 --> 01:58:16,898
And then second part being the town hall listening session so that those are concrete, measurable.

1114
01:58:16,998 --> 01:58:18,379
We can see it, we can observe it.

1115
01:58:18,439 --> 01:58:22,241
We have an agenda that's translated each week, et cetera.

1116
01:58:22,301 --> 01:58:35,909
So I think that would be a great way to start to focus on helping people proactively understand what happens here at the school committee meeting and know what is on the agenda even.

1117
01:58:36,349 --> 01:58:36,669
That's great.

1118
01:58:37,998 --> 01:58:39,599
Member McLaughlin.

1119
01:58:39,679 --> 01:58:40,319
I'm sorry.

1120
01:58:40,339 --> 01:58:40,559
Sure.

1121
01:58:40,579 --> 01:58:46,662
No, I was just going to say, could one of the goals be to expand our finance?

1122
01:58:46,762 --> 01:58:50,964
I love that in the budgetary priorities, you have a theater teacher.

1123
01:58:51,425 --> 01:58:59,709
So I think just the option of expanding or the goal of expanding more theater electives, both in the middle school and the high school.

1124
01:59:00,269 --> 01:59:01,990
And if we could even increase

1125
01:59:02,489 --> 01:59:07,090
the music options in the middle school and the high school, which of course would take on more staff.

1126
01:59:07,170 --> 01:59:15,331
But I really think we've all received a number of emails with all the benefits of theater and music for students, both in the middle school and the high school level.

1127
01:59:16,411 --> 01:59:16,711
Thank you.

1128
01:59:16,791 --> 01:59:17,292
Thank you.

1129
01:59:18,612 --> 01:59:19,652
Member McLaughlin.

1130
01:59:19,932 --> 01:59:20,332
Excuse me.

1131
01:59:20,372 --> 01:59:27,713
I just wanted to respond to the chair to member Graham's recommendation for that equity goal.

1132
01:59:28,494 --> 01:59:29,674
I think that's reasonable.

1133
01:59:29,714 --> 01:59:30,954
Although my only concern about

1134
01:59:32,156 --> 01:59:38,899
agenda only, which I think it is good to have it in a step fashion so that it's also not overwhelming for the reader.

1135
01:59:40,160 --> 01:59:55,026
One of my concerns is that by seeing the agenda only and not the minutes or the notes at this point, but ultimately minutes, I hope, I'm not sure that people can understand the resolution of the process.

1136
01:59:55,086 --> 01:59:59,468
If you're only seeing agendas over agendas, is anything getting done?

1137
02:00:02,259 --> 02:00:04,340
I'd like to think creatively about that.

1138
02:00:05,921 --> 02:00:07,782
Yeah, I mean, I agree.

1139
02:00:07,802 --> 02:00:10,244
I just think we have to start somewhere.

1140
02:00:10,444 --> 02:00:17,368
And if we try to start, like, too big, I think we're going to struggle.

1141
02:00:17,388 --> 02:00:24,953
I just don't want to see us get none of the things done because we're trying to do too many things all at the same time.

1142
02:00:25,073 --> 02:00:28,595
So, and, you know, this is through November.

1143
02:00:28,615 --> 02:00:28,655
So,

1144
02:00:29,645 --> 02:00:43,008
If we can make that part of the process, hopefully we have our new communications director on board, then come November and December, we can be talking about that next iteration after that.

1145
02:00:43,028 --> 02:00:44,288
I guess that's my thought.

1146
02:00:44,609 --> 02:00:51,750
From the chair, I think this is a great goal, but the work of the goal is gonna fall on our superintendent and the admin shoulders on this goal.

1147
02:00:51,850 --> 02:00:53,851
So I do think we have to just take it in stride.

1148
02:00:54,471 --> 02:00:55,711
We do have so much going on.

1149
02:00:56,011 --> 02:00:57,112
Well, yes, thank you.

1150
02:00:57,912 --> 02:00:58,112
Mayor?

1151
02:00:59,867 --> 02:01:11,533
Um, yes, but again, I think that when you say it, when we say like this, the, the work is going to fall on the, the, the school, I think we all have to be responsible for this as well.

1152
02:01:11,573 --> 02:01:14,175
And I don't necessarily think that it's all the work just goes on the school.

1153
02:01:14,215 --> 02:01:19,537
I think that we look at the budget and we think about how are we allocating this in our line items in our budget.

1154
02:01:19,597 --> 02:01:22,459
So, you know, our, our budget shows our values as well.

1155
02:01:22,539 --> 02:01:26,301
So I think that it's not a matter of here is more work for the same amount of money.

1156
02:01:26,441 --> 02:01:28,202
It's no, this is important and we need to.

1157
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:33,841
think about how we're doing this so that it is meaningful and that we're all taking ownership of it, number one.

1158
02:01:34,681 --> 02:01:55,325
And number two, I agree that it's important to have it graduated, so I'm fine with that, with the understanding, as Member Graham was saying, that it would be expanded, that this is because we have such a short schedule on these particular goals, as school committee members, that we will look to be expanding this.

1159
02:01:55,906 --> 02:01:57,546
But I think, obviously, that will be assessed

1160
02:01:58,666 --> 02:02:04,449
when we reconvene or when whoever reconvenes for the next set of goals that they'll be setting.

1161
02:02:05,729 --> 02:02:11,332
So again, I just have a motion for equity to be one of the goals with those understandings that were discussed.

1162
02:02:11,372 --> 02:02:12,612
If there's a second.

1163
02:02:13,633 --> 02:02:19,695
Motion for goal number one and goal number two to be our goals for the year by member McLaughlin.

1164
02:02:20,936 --> 02:02:21,796
That's your motion.

1165
02:02:21,876 --> 02:02:22,977
Seconded by member Kretz.

1166
02:02:24,658 --> 02:02:25,398
All those in favor?

1167
02:02:26,659 --> 02:02:27,439
All those opposed?

1168
02:02:28,971 --> 02:02:32,874
goals have been set through November for school committee.

1169
02:02:34,616 --> 02:02:36,057
That's not the only goal, right?

1170
02:02:36,597 --> 02:02:37,818
Two goals we just approved.

1171
02:02:38,259 --> 02:02:39,320
That's one goal.

1172
02:02:40,821 --> 02:02:42,082
Oh, did we?

1173
02:02:43,824 --> 02:02:46,125
We can separate the motion.

1174
02:02:46,145 --> 02:02:47,567
We already took the motion.

1175
02:02:47,947 --> 02:02:48,708
Okay, well then.

1176
02:02:50,589 --> 02:02:51,270
Yeah, I mean,

1177
02:02:51,983 --> 02:03:20,763
Yeah, I'm okay with making that amendment to the motion, that equity with the measurable benchmarks we mentioned of one, or A, having school committee agendas translated in our primary languages, our three primary languages, beginning September, and two, having at least one, for lack of a better word, people can call it what we want when we decide,

1178
02:03:21,781 --> 02:03:26,544
a town hall discussion with interpretation.

1179
02:03:26,564 --> 02:03:28,266
Do you want to move motion for reconsideration?

1180
02:03:28,326 --> 02:03:29,106
The motion was taken.

1181
02:03:29,847 --> 02:03:34,430
Yes, I want to make a motion for reconsideration by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Rousseau.

1182
02:03:34,490 --> 02:03:35,311
All those in favor?

1183
02:03:35,331 --> 02:03:35,591
Aye.

1184
02:03:35,971 --> 02:03:36,652
All those opposed?

1185
02:03:36,732 --> 02:03:37,012
Okay.

1186
02:03:37,732 --> 02:03:38,633
Okay.

1187
02:03:38,753 --> 02:03:39,213
Thank you.

1188
02:03:39,874 --> 02:03:41,255
So did you get any of that?

1189
02:03:41,755 --> 02:03:41,995
No.

1190
02:03:42,396 --> 02:03:42,856
I have it all.

1191
02:03:44,017 --> 02:03:44,237
Good.

1192
02:03:44,597 --> 02:03:46,799
You can read it because I don't have any of it.

1193
02:03:49,431 --> 02:03:50,151
Markie, do you have it?

1194
02:03:50,652 --> 02:03:52,153
No, she gets it from me.

1195
02:03:52,353 --> 02:03:53,073
Oh, she gets it from you.

1196
02:03:53,854 --> 02:03:55,995
It's fine, I'll do it again.

1197
02:03:56,015 --> 02:04:17,090
I am making a motion that our school committee has goals, equity being one of them as a accountability measure based on our goals with two sections of equity measurable benchmarks, one which be-

1198
02:04:18,271 --> 02:04:19,772
Type fast, not that, too fast.

1199
02:04:20,212 --> 02:04:21,653
Two seconds of equity goals.

1200
02:04:24,254 --> 02:04:41,643
One, which would be having a translated agenda beginning September, school committee agenda beginning September, and our three most often used languages, which is Haitian Creole, Portuguese, and Spanish.

1201
02:04:44,725 --> 02:04:46,566
And two, that we host

1202
02:04:48,582 --> 02:05:11,057
a town hall, for lack of a better word, with interpretation, interpreters, and also in those three languages, and it can be a topic-based town hall, and maybe we can think about what that is between now and the beginning of September by talking to some of our community members.

1203
02:05:11,964 --> 02:05:14,406
who might be interested in specific topics.

1204
02:05:15,467 --> 02:05:18,630
And then two would be expanding the fine arts.

1205
02:05:19,731 --> 02:05:24,776
And maybe member Mistone could speak a little bit to that amendment.

1206
02:05:26,457 --> 02:05:28,979
Expanding the fine arts, just expanding the fine arts.

1207
02:05:29,219 --> 02:05:34,324
In the middle school and high school and explore additional music and theater opportunities.

1208
02:05:34,764 --> 02:05:35,065
Perfect.

1209
02:05:36,146 --> 02:05:38,708
Explore additional theater and music opportunities.

1210
02:05:38,988 --> 02:05:39,448
Thank you.

1211
02:05:39,568 --> 02:05:41,850
So, I have a motion if I can get a second.

1212
02:05:42,410 --> 02:05:43,030
For both of those.

1213
02:05:43,450 --> 02:05:44,151
For both of those.

1214
02:05:44,171 --> 02:05:44,911
Okay.

1215
02:05:44,931 --> 02:05:45,632
It's one motion.

1216
02:05:46,092 --> 02:05:46,232
Yup.

1217
02:05:46,552 --> 02:05:47,113
One motion.

1218
02:05:47,133 --> 02:05:47,233
Yes.

1219
02:05:47,453 --> 02:05:50,514
To include goal number one, goal number two by member McLaughlin.

1220
02:05:51,355 --> 02:05:55,537
Is is this the only are we where we can still have other goals, right?

1221
02:05:55,557 --> 02:05:58,039
We haven't talked about Medford High and I don't think we can.

1222
02:05:58,259 --> 02:05:58,479
Sorry.

1223
02:05:58,919 --> 02:06:03,662
Um I don't think we can like button it up if we have not addressed anything about Medford High.

1224
02:06:09,414 --> 02:06:14,280
Well, maybe Member McLaughlin, if you could hold your motion, because I think it was suggested we do two to three goals.

1225
02:06:14,440 --> 02:06:15,462
So let's talk it all through.

1226
02:06:16,042 --> 02:06:19,406
Yeah, if we want a third, or if we want to change any of these.

1227
02:06:19,647 --> 02:06:23,191
Member Stone, you had your light on first, and then Member Graham.

1228
02:06:23,211 --> 02:06:23,692
No, I'm good.

1229
02:06:23,792 --> 02:06:24,052
You're good.

1230
02:06:24,212 --> 02:06:24,593
Member Graham.

1231
02:06:25,521 --> 02:06:36,803
So I do think one of our goals has to be around creating and approving an action plan for the next school year at Medford High.

1232
02:06:36,883 --> 02:06:41,264
So we talked about the action plan that's in place like right now.

1233
02:06:41,744 --> 02:06:43,805
We have a consultant who's doing work.

1234
02:06:44,165 --> 02:06:46,205
We have a climate survey that's coming up.

1235
02:06:46,285 --> 02:06:48,546
We have a climate and culture assessment that's coming up.

1236
02:06:48,566 --> 02:06:53,927
So we've all these things happening and the output of all of that is meaningless

1237
02:06:54,437 --> 02:07:01,519
if we don't create an action plan that turns those things into observable change in the building.

1238
02:07:02,039 --> 02:07:16,924
So I think one of the things that's incumbent on us to do is to request and approve an action plan for the high school for the next school year, ideally around the start of school.

1239
02:07:16,984 --> 02:07:21,785
But I think it's the single hottest

1240
02:07:22,799 --> 02:07:25,061
question in the community right now.

1241
02:07:25,701 --> 02:07:29,103
And we need to make sure that we're being responsive to that.

1242
02:07:29,244 --> 02:07:40,932
And that as we talk about the budget, as we talk about all these things, that we are aligning with these goals that we're going to create to drive some of those budget decisions that we inevitably always have to make.

1243
02:07:41,012 --> 02:07:51,920
So I want to make sure that things like, do we have enough assistant principals gets talked about, discussed, prioritized, all of those things when we are handling the budget.

1244
02:07:52,830 --> 02:08:14,343
I feel like talking about it as the creation of a FY24 action plan and approval by this committee of what that action plan is for the FY24 school year is probably the right way to describe it right now, because we have all these moving parts that are still coming into focus.

1245
02:08:16,184 --> 02:08:16,884
Thank you, Member Graham.

1246
02:08:17,665 --> 02:08:18,265
Member Russo?

1247
02:08:18,685 --> 02:08:19,826
Could you repeat that, Member Graham?

1248
02:08:21,027 --> 02:08:30,354
action plan for 2023-2024 as it relates to Medford High School that we request and eventually approve such plan.

1249
02:08:30,374 --> 02:08:35,618
Thank you.

1250
02:08:35,638 --> 02:08:36,599
Member McLaughlin.

1251
02:08:37,299 --> 02:08:38,160
Yes, thank you.

1252
02:08:38,220 --> 02:08:43,524
So in the way that that is measurable is that it is that we are receiving a plan and approving it.

1253
02:08:43,544 --> 02:08:46,226
So we would

1254
02:08:51,078 --> 02:09:06,987
want to be, we would want to approve the plan, you know, around the start of school, so maybe by October 1st, because then we want to see it executed right across the year and be able to say, we're doing these things, we've done these things, here's what's changing.

1255
02:09:08,188 --> 02:09:17,574
And will data be collected across the, over the year by us to, to demonstrate that we're being held accountable to that plan?

1256
02:09:18,652 --> 02:09:21,773
So the point, I think, I guess part of what I'm asking, I think it's a great idea.

1257
02:09:22,593 --> 02:09:33,976
I'm trying to understand the measurable, the way that the community can measure whether the school committee was accountable in the process.

1258
02:09:33,996 --> 02:09:40,197
And so maybe it's just in the first phase because it's the second phase potentially for the next set of goals might be around review.

1259
02:09:40,357 --> 02:09:41,397
Okay, all right, okay.

1260
02:09:41,638 --> 02:09:42,978
That's exactly what I was gonna say.

1261
02:09:42,998 --> 02:09:47,539
Yeah, this is the first part of a goal that we'll continue on in our next yearly goals.

1262
02:09:48,280 --> 02:09:54,583
Okay, so I make a motion for those three goals for school committee.

1263
02:09:55,003 --> 02:09:56,503
Did you get them all, Member Russo?

1264
02:09:57,204 --> 02:09:57,704
I got them.

1265
02:09:57,724 --> 02:10:01,445
I didn't think all the other members had a chance to perhaps propose their ideas of goals.

1266
02:10:02,726 --> 02:10:03,266
Member Russo?

1267
02:10:04,347 --> 02:10:09,629
I wasn't trying to get myself in the list, but there's four other members here that might have ideas.

1268
02:10:09,749 --> 02:10:11,770
I was wondering if we were gonna let them speak.

1269
02:10:12,590 --> 02:10:13,991
Anybody's welcome to speak.

1270
02:10:14,111 --> 02:10:14,631
Member Hayes?

1271
02:10:16,189 --> 02:10:30,694
Well, we had talked last time, it's kind of an easy goal to put in because we're already doing it, but we had talked about the updating of the superintendent evaluation process as being one of the, possibly being one of the school committee goals, given that we're already in process of doing that.

1272
02:10:31,534 --> 02:10:33,275
So I'll throw that out as an idea.

1273
02:10:33,295 --> 02:10:36,776
I feel like we've accomplished that and you've taken the lead.

1274
02:10:37,396 --> 02:10:38,517
Well, we're still working on it.

1275
02:10:38,997 --> 02:10:43,919
So, I mean, just a thought, it's already, it's already happening.

1276
02:10:43,959 --> 02:10:44,219
So yeah.

1277
02:10:45,796 --> 02:10:49,457
to add so that the community knows?

1278
02:10:53,078 --> 02:10:57,419
I think that's an easy goal to accomplish since we're already underway on it.

1279
02:10:57,459 --> 02:11:04,020
So I would be fine with adding that as a fourth goal, if you will, because I think we are underway for doing that.

1280
02:11:04,080 --> 02:11:12,462
And again, I think, thank you member Hayes for that process and getting that underway and for MASC for informing the process

1281
02:11:13,166 --> 02:11:21,511
for everybody being so patient with the process, but I think it's much improved, and I think that's a great measurement of how we've worked together.

1282
02:11:21,531 --> 02:11:23,792
Agreed.

1283
02:11:24,913 --> 02:11:27,875
So wanna add that four goals.

1284
02:11:27,895 --> 02:11:29,496
Does anybody else have anything to add?

1285
02:11:30,396 --> 02:11:30,836
Member Kretz?

1286
02:11:30,877 --> 02:11:33,778
Yes, I had that one too as a reminder.

1287
02:11:34,178 --> 02:11:41,603
And then I also have, and this is something I think that we have to do, is replace the finance director,

1288
02:11:42,365 --> 02:11:49,148
Um, so that's something that I had down as well, but I just think that's something that, you know, it's just something that we have to do.

1289
02:11:49,228 --> 02:12:00,634
So I don't know if it's actually, um, a goal, but you know, it's, it's something that I had down that and something we're already doing, which is the earlier budget process, which the superintendent presented tonight.

1290
02:12:01,094 --> 02:12:02,635
So we got that information.

1291
02:12:04,096 --> 02:12:07,058
earlier budget process, which we already started tonight.

1292
02:12:07,739 --> 02:12:17,127
And lastly, submitting the MSBA application, which is something that we're going to be doing.

1293
02:12:17,987 --> 02:12:18,588
Is that correct?

1294
02:12:18,808 --> 02:12:20,149
We can make that goal number five.

1295
02:12:20,229 --> 02:12:21,470
We need to make sure that's in.

1296
02:12:21,770 --> 02:12:22,331
How about that?

1297
02:12:23,432 --> 02:12:24,533
So number one, equity.

1298
02:12:24,553 --> 02:12:25,974
Number two, expanding fine arts.

1299
02:12:25,994 --> 02:12:29,316
Number three, action plan for 2023-2024 Medford High School.

1300
02:12:30,297 --> 02:12:33,480
Goal number four, superintendent's evaluation, which is underway.

1301
02:12:34,434 --> 02:12:39,656
needs to be completed, and goal number five, submitting the application to the MSBA for Medford High School.

1302
02:12:40,556 --> 02:12:41,337
Yes, thank you.

1303
02:12:41,977 --> 02:12:42,757
Motion to approve.

1304
02:12:43,638 --> 02:12:44,658
By member McLaughlin.

1305
02:12:45,779 --> 02:12:46,499
Member Rousseau.

1306
02:12:46,959 --> 02:12:47,159
Yes.

1307
02:12:48,500 --> 02:12:48,860
Thank you.

1308
02:12:50,180 --> 02:12:56,403
Before the meeting, I looked up what other school committees do for goals, and I'm looking at an example from Falmouth.

1309
02:12:57,563 --> 02:13:04,026
The most striking thing is that school committee goals are for a bunch of work for school committees to do, not for their staff.

1310
02:13:05,320 --> 02:13:13,424
I feel like we've just created a pile of work that we're just going to be able to come to a meeting and vote and say we had our goals and they were met or not met.

1311
02:13:14,004 --> 02:13:18,166
But none of us has to go do any work other than perhaps go to the meetings.

1312
02:13:18,486 --> 02:13:26,110
And I look at other goals from other committees and the committees are doing all of the work, all of it.

1313
02:13:26,150 --> 02:13:34,194
Figuring out how to have processes so when we change policies, we actually say what the policy is and we say what line is changing from what to what.

1314
02:13:34,735 --> 02:13:46,618
whether we have goals around motions that are not seven paragraphs long, we've all done it where we just, my motion is, and two and a half minutes later, we stopped talking.

1315
02:13:47,158 --> 02:13:50,298
That's not a motion, that's a conversation.

1316
02:13:50,418 --> 02:13:52,699
And somewhere in there is a one sentence motion.

1317
02:13:53,779 --> 02:14:01,561
And then, you know, when I go to school committee trainings, the motion should be read at least four or five times by the chair before we vote.

1318
02:14:03,974 --> 02:14:06,995
That's what they say when you go to the trainings on how to run a good meeting.

1319
02:14:08,476 --> 02:14:14,098
I would never expect the mayor to do that because we'd be here all night long figuring out what is the language.

1320
02:14:14,158 --> 02:14:21,721
We leave it to Markey and Susie before her and Lisa to go to the video and try to figure out what the motion was.

1321
02:14:22,261 --> 02:14:25,042
Those are the goals that I see when I look at other school committees.

1322
02:14:25,522 --> 02:14:29,224
So nothing that has been brought up by any member here I disagree with.

1323
02:14:30,353 --> 02:14:34,354
I just feel like we just need to add two more staff people to the budget to accomplish them.

1324
02:14:35,315 --> 02:14:43,417
And my understanding of school committee goals was the goals for us as a body and how to do our job better.

1325
02:14:45,458 --> 02:14:47,479
That's just all I wanted to say.

1326
02:14:47,499 --> 02:14:52,841
I didn't really add a goal, but I really thought it was important that I say what I thought school committee goals were.

1327
02:14:54,381 --> 02:14:55,301
Thank you, member Russo.

1328
02:14:55,762 --> 02:14:59,883
Motion on the floor by member McLaughlin, seconded by member

1329
02:15:00,345 --> 02:15:00,685
Second.

1330
02:15:00,825 --> 02:15:02,686
Kratz, roll call, please.

1331
02:15:07,348 --> 02:15:07,809
Member Graham.

1332
02:15:08,109 --> 02:15:08,329
Yes.

1333
02:15:09,289 --> 02:15:09,750
Member Hayes.

1334
02:15:10,130 --> 02:15:10,330
Yes.

1335
02:15:11,310 --> 02:15:11,791
Member Kratz.

1336
02:15:12,011 --> 02:15:12,251
Yes.

1337
02:15:13,231 --> 02:15:13,932
Member McLaughlin.

1338
02:15:14,492 --> 02:15:14,792
Yes.

1339
02:15:15,753 --> 02:15:16,513
Member Mastone.

1340
02:15:16,653 --> 02:15:16,853
Yes.

1341
02:15:18,454 --> 02:15:19,154
Member Rousseau.

1342
02:15:19,414 --> 02:15:19,615
No.

1343
02:15:19,835 --> 02:15:20,515
Mayor Lungo-Kern.

1344
02:15:21,035 --> 02:15:21,335
Yes.

1345
02:15:21,936 --> 02:15:24,397
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1346
02:15:24,897 --> 02:15:26,378
Motion passes for the five goals.

1347
02:15:28,756 --> 02:15:30,077

Member Graham, Chair, Member Hayes, Member Russo.

1350
02:15:38,760 --> 02:15:43,342
Proposed policy for dedication and naming of school committee buildings, facilities, and grounds.

1351
02:15:43,902 --> 02:15:50,385
The school committee has sole authority over the naming or renaming of buildings, interior facilities, and grounds in the public schools.

1352
02:15:51,065 --> 02:15:55,987
The school committee recognizes that the names of school facilities must be undertaken with care and scrutiny.

1353
02:15:56,806 --> 02:16:04,849
This policy is intended to ensure that names and or other wording associated with school facilities will promote and or be consistent with the goals of the Met for Public Schools.

1354
02:16:05,829 --> 02:16:09,610
The naming process should include student, family, community, and staff voices.

1355
02:16:09,890 --> 02:16:10,310
Bless you.

1356
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:22,394
When naming a school facility, preference is given to those persons, organizations, and events which had a substantial impact on the education of Medford students, persons or events that reflect the increasing diversity of Medford students' population,

1357
02:16:23,541 --> 02:16:29,925
This guidance shall not preclude consideration of names or persons of local, state, national, or international significance.

1358
02:16:30,385 --> 02:16:34,747
Names of persons employed by the school or city at the time of dedication shall not be considered.

1359
02:16:35,208 --> 02:16:43,993
The school committee reserves the right to remove a name at any time if it is in the best interest of the district or donor to do so, or to protect the reputation of the district and or the donor.

1362
02:16:56,126 --> 02:17:03,412
The item should specifically specify the intent of the requester and the details of the intended financial contribution.

1363
02:17:03,992 --> 02:17:07,935
It should offer appropriate background information and the person or organization in the request.

1364
02:17:08,395 --> 02:17:16,522
The school committee will consider the request and invite public input at least two consecutive meetings before a vote to approve or deny the request is taken.

1365
02:17:16,542 --> 02:17:22,386
A gift agreement between the donor and the school committee must be approved simultaneously as the name is voted.

1366
02:17:22,844 --> 02:17:30,566
The standard agreement must specify the building interior facility or grounds to be named, the duration of the naming period, as well as payment terms.

1367
02:17:31,847 --> 02:17:37,809
These agreements will be considered for the public record, kept on file by the school committee for access by the public.

1368
02:17:38,629 --> 02:17:44,991
In order for a building facility grounds to be named that is not accompanied by a financial contribution, the following procedure shall be followed.

1370
02:17:50,208 --> 02:17:51,509
school grounds to be named.

1371
02:17:51,669 --> 02:17:58,854
The school committee shall establish a naming advisory committee pursuant to policy BDF advisory committee to the school committee.

1372
02:17:59,375 --> 02:18:06,140
The naming advisory committee shall adhere to the charge established in forming the committee, including public participation, timelines, and other criteria.

1373
02:18:06,800 --> 02:18:11,284
The school committee shall receive recommendations from the naming advisory committee at a regular school committee meeting.

1374
02:18:11,864 --> 02:18:14,226
The school committee shall by majority vote adopt a name

1375
02:18:14,960 --> 02:18:21,004
While the school committee is not required to accept the recommendations of the naming advisory committee, it looks forward to supporting those recommendations whenever possible.

1376
02:18:21,664 --> 02:18:27,208
In order for a classroom or space within a school building to be named, the following procedure shall be followed.

1377
02:18:27,348 --> 02:18:29,569
A written request is placed in the school committee agenda.

1378

The item should specify the intent of the requester and the reasons why this particular name would fit with the space.

1379
02:18:37,094 --> 02:18:41,657
It should offer appropriate background information on the person or organization in the request.

1380
02:18:42,918 --> 02:18:49,701
School committee will consider the request and invite public input at two consecutive meetings before a vote to approve or deny the request is taken.

1381
02:18:50,162 --> 02:18:53,523
School committee may choose to send the request to a naming advisory committee.

1382
02:18:54,103 --> 02:19:03,288
In order for a community giving program where donors will be invited to give to a project in exchange for physical dedication, the following procedures shall be followed.

1383
02:19:03,548 --> 02:19:07,930
The program rules and required donation levels will be placed in a regular school committee agenda.

1384
02:19:07,950 --> 02:19:11,492
The item should describe the program placement of

1385
02:19:12,605 --> 02:19:15,188
the physical dedications, donor levels, and other rules.

1386
02:19:15,288 --> 02:19:18,111
The school committee will consider the request and invite public input.

1387
02:19:18,651 --> 02:19:25,238
The school committee may make a decision at any time, provided that public input was received before the vote of approval or denial.

1388
02:19:27,821 --> 02:19:28,561
Motion for approval.

1389
02:19:28,822 --> 02:19:29,062
Mayor.

1390
02:19:29,703 --> 02:19:30,984
Member Rousseau.

1391
02:19:31,184 --> 02:19:31,604
I'd like to

1392
02:19:32,882 --> 02:19:45,891
I don't believe this would count as an amendment and require a second reading, but I'd like to motion that the approval of this policy, should it pass, goes into effect on July 1, 2023, rather than immediately, as is normal.

1393
02:19:47,272 --> 02:19:52,896
Motion for approval of second reading, as amended, this will go into effect July 1, 2023, by Member Rousseau.

1394
02:19:53,757 --> 02:19:58,380
Can I, Member Graham, just cite some concern about that.

1395
02:19:58,560 --> 02:19:59,321
So right now,

1396
02:20:00,945 --> 02:20:20,918
There really is no policy around naming and I don't want to create a vacuum where everyone decides like we're gonna rush and name everything that we can like name in the schools however we want because the policy doesn't exist until July 1st and nobody can say anything about it and then we've got sort of like a angry mess to unwind.

1397
02:20:22,870 --> 02:20:28,133
So I'm not in favor of delaying the implementation of that.

1398
02:20:28,193 --> 02:20:32,596
I think if people want to bring forward a request, the policy has lots of ways to do that.

1399
02:20:33,437 --> 02:20:35,338
And it should go into effect immediately.

1400
02:20:35,358 --> 02:20:39,320
And if I may, from the chair, I've got some people speaking out.

1401
02:20:39,360 --> 02:20:47,566
I think member Kretz had mentioned this last meeting, just very concerned about the process that we went through before and just creating more division in the community.

1402
02:20:48,226 --> 02:20:51,228
But I know member Graham, one of the big things about this is

1403
02:20:51,792 --> 02:21:01,159
all the work that's being done by you, the committee, Dr. Cushing, a whole host of people on the McGlynn playground, rehabilitation.

1404
02:21:01,299 --> 02:21:06,764
So we are gonna be looking for donors and I believe that would be prior to July 1st, 2023.

1405
02:21:06,864 --> 02:21:14,330
So I too think that we should be getting the donors in many different ways for that project.

1406
02:21:14,390 --> 02:21:20,715
It's gonna be wonderful, but expensive and we'd like to be able to implement this policy to see that happen.

1407
02:21:21,468 --> 02:21:22,908
I don't know if member Russo has this.

1408
02:21:23,468 --> 02:21:24,689
We'll withdraw his motion, thank you.

1409
02:21:24,729 --> 02:21:31,990
So motion for approval by member Graham, seconded by member Hayes.

1410
02:21:32,670 --> 02:21:33,510
All those in favor?

1411
02:21:33,890 --> 02:21:34,331
Aye.

1412
02:21:34,411 --> 02:21:35,211
All those opposed?

1413
02:21:35,771 --> 02:21:36,471
Paper passes.

1414
02:21:37,231 --> 02:21:39,672
New business offered by member Hayes, McLaughlin, and Ms.

1415
02:21:39,712 --> 02:21:46,253
Stone, whereas the Memphis School Committee values the thoughts, concerns, ideas, and experiences of the students who attend our schools,

1416
02:21:46,820 --> 02:21:57,787
be resolved the school committee will seek to encourage student participation in regular school committee meetings through the addition of an agenda item to every regular meeting agenda titled presentations of students with the following description.

1417
02:21:58,147 --> 02:21:59,147
Presentation of students.

1418
02:22:00,028 --> 02:22:08,413
Regular meetings of the Medford school committee include this presentation of students agenda item to give any Medford public school student the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

1419
02:22:08,913 --> 02:22:10,634
Student may only present once at any meeting.

1420
02:22:10,694 --> 02:22:16,698
These presentations are an opportunity for students to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

1421
02:22:16,983 --> 02:22:27,010
one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic, a member may request that the item be added to the regular school committee meeting, the next regular school committee meeting.

1422
02:22:27,090 --> 02:22:36,316
The details for submitting a presentation can be found within the policy, pursuant to policy BEDH, public comment and presentations to the public.

1423
02:22:36,576 --> 02:22:42,400
Any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any agenda item for up to three minutes.

1424
02:22:42,921 --> 02:22:46,303
The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

1425
02:22:47,302 --> 02:22:52,206
The speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and full Medford Street address where they reside.

1426
02:22:52,906 --> 02:22:58,311
A welcoming, inclusive community is both a value of the Medford School Committee and an aspirational goal.

1427
02:22:58,451 --> 02:23:01,274
We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

1428
02:23:01,814 --> 02:23:05,137
Motion for approval by Member Hayes.

1429
02:23:06,919 --> 02:23:08,660
Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1430
02:23:08,920 --> 02:23:09,741
All those in favor?

1431
02:23:09,801 --> 02:23:10,101
Mayor.

1432
02:23:10,522 --> 02:23:11,162
Member Graham.

1433
02:23:11,182 --> 02:23:11,883
I was,

1434
02:23:14,929 --> 02:23:15,850
I just had some questions.

1435
02:23:15,930 --> 02:23:24,936
I think, generally speaking, what I thought this was trying to do is make sure there's a formal place for students to speak to us, right?

1436
02:23:26,197 --> 02:23:26,738
Which I love.

1437
02:23:28,219 --> 02:23:40,628
I feel like this might not, like there's other ways that school committees do this, much more simply than telling students they're gonna come and we're not gonna talk to them and then they, you know,

1438
02:23:41,101 --> 02:23:42,542
that feels sort of onerous.

1439
02:23:43,123 --> 02:23:47,587
I think there's lots of other ways school committees are doing that like really regularly, especially with student reps.

1440
02:23:48,908 --> 02:23:51,950
And of course, students are always part of public participation.

1441
02:23:52,010 --> 02:23:58,296
So I guess my thought would be to make sure that we all agree that we want to like

1442
02:23:58,561 --> 02:24:16,945
put a formal place on the agenda for students to speak and then ask the rules policy subcommittee to like work this into the agenda in a like cohesive fashion so that it's part of the policy, it's part of our rules, it's part of all the things because there is a policy change here that has to go through that process.

1443
02:24:16,965 --> 02:24:25,006
So I think the rules committee, the policy committee could do that if we are clear on what the intent is, which is to be able to hear student voices.

1444
02:24:27,187 --> 02:24:27,787
Member Hayes.

1445
02:24:28,422 --> 02:24:29,023
Thanks.

1446
02:24:29,423 --> 02:24:33,328
Yes, we did talk about sending it to the Rules and Policy Committee three months ago.

1447
02:24:33,769 --> 02:24:41,638
It hasn't come up yet, so I thought maybe this would be a different route to try to get it formally moved forward.

1448
02:24:42,740 --> 02:24:44,762
So this was my attempt to do that.

1449
02:24:47,520 --> 02:24:48,381
I don't know what to say.

1450
02:24:48,421 --> 02:24:51,443
I think that I've made that attempt to do that in a formal way.

1451
02:24:51,483 --> 02:24:57,368
We did all vote on it, and it was passed through a motion to send it to a committee that it has not yet been brought up to.

1452
02:24:57,949 --> 02:25:06,436
So... I don't remember a motion to send it to the... Yes, December 5th, it was motioned to be sent to the Rules and Policy Subcommittee.

1453
02:25:08,197 --> 02:25:10,299
Okay.

1454
02:25:10,659 --> 02:25:11,220
Member Russo?

1455
02:25:11,924 --> 02:25:14,106
As the chair of that subcommittee, that is correct.

1456
02:25:14,266 --> 02:25:18,249
I don't remember the specific one, but that is not surprising.

1457
02:25:18,309 --> 02:25:26,156
We have a very long list of things that have been sent to that subcommittee and we've prioritized bullying and the recess policy.

1458
02:25:26,416 --> 02:25:30,879
And when we get through with those, we will go on to the other items in the list.

1459
02:25:32,040 --> 02:25:34,963
I believe we have eight subcommittees and

1460
02:25:37,806 --> 02:25:40,132
We can certainly send these items to other subcommittees.

1461
02:25:40,613 --> 02:25:43,741
Every member here is supposed to be writing policy.

1462
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:48,903
It is not a rules and policy subcommittee only activity to write policy.

1463
02:25:48,923 --> 02:25:50,124
It is the job of this committee.

1464
02:25:51,205 --> 02:25:58,650
So if we would like to take that item and motion to move it to a different subcommittee, I would be thrilled because the list is long.

1465
02:25:59,831 --> 02:26:05,956
And sometimes the crisis of the day decides what the order of things are going to be.

1466
02:26:06,336 --> 02:26:08,458
As it is in any subcommittee in every government

1467
02:26:09,346 --> 02:26:26,944
that exists, the chair looks at the list, consults with members and takes the temperature of the community and says, you know what, the bullying and prevention and intervention policy is more important than changing our policy to have an item on there for student participation.

1468
02:26:29,244 --> 02:26:31,588
That's just the way it operates.

1469
02:26:31,788 --> 02:26:41,202
It's not that there's like a desire to not have the thing heard or discussed because that's in the previous year before member Hayes was a member of this body.

1470
02:26:42,216 --> 02:26:52,082
There was a huge effort that I participated in with our student representatives to do a very long list of changes to include far more student participation.

1471
02:26:53,563 --> 02:27:01,768
And much of that was not deemed even legal, because the state has all kinds of weird rules about student participation.

1472
02:27:02,809 --> 02:27:07,952
But there is certainly no interest in preventing student participation.

1473
02:27:08,032 --> 02:27:10,694
I feel a bit like that's the implication.

1474
02:27:12,996 --> 02:27:15,590
Member McLaughlin, then Member Hayes, then we have a resident.

1475
02:27:16,877 --> 02:27:31,680
Sure, I was just going to say I'm happy as the chair of the diversity, equity and inclusion subcommittee to take that on and make our proposed policy with my committee members to move the issue forward.

1476
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:36,641
I do think it's important, obviously, that our students see themselves on the agenda.

1477
02:27:36,701 --> 02:27:44,763
It's not just about having the opportunity, which everyone has the opportunity to come up and speak, but seeing themselves on the agenda lets them know that

1478
02:27:45,303 --> 02:27:47,745
We value them and we think it's important.

1479
02:27:47,805 --> 02:27:52,968
So I would be happy to take that on as the chair of the DEI with my committee members.

1480
02:27:57,131 --> 02:27:57,471
Thank you.

1481
02:27:57,811 --> 02:28:00,113
Yes, that might be a good way to go about it.

1482
02:28:00,193 --> 02:28:03,555
I just want to be clear that this was not an attempt to criticize in any way.

1483
02:28:03,915 --> 02:28:11,780
It was an attempt to move something forward where I knew that there were other things that were of more pressing importance in the subcommittee that it originally was set to.

1484
02:28:11,880 --> 02:28:14,282
So I apologize if it came across as a criticism.

1485
02:28:15,143 --> 02:28:18,445
I was really specifically trying not to make it that way.

1486
02:28:18,485 --> 02:28:22,108
I was just trying to present it in a different way to hopefully move it forward.

1487
02:28:22,628 --> 02:28:22,949
Thank you.

1488
02:28:23,989 --> 02:28:24,670
Thank you, Member Hayes.

1489
02:28:25,590 --> 02:28:25,690
Ms.

1490
02:28:25,711 --> 02:28:26,011
Brantley.

1491
02:28:26,211 --> 02:28:26,991
Did they turn that on?

1492
02:28:27,011 --> 02:28:28,573
Because I didn't think I was going to be able to do it.

1493
02:28:29,233 --> 02:28:30,474
I missed you.

1494
02:28:30,554 --> 02:28:34,897
Usually it's very good, especially late at night when it's like, come on, there's only one more thing to go.

1495
02:28:34,917 --> 02:28:35,417
Let's do this.

1496
02:28:35,477 --> 02:28:36,718
I'm not going to talk long, I promise.

1497
02:28:36,738 --> 02:28:37,499
So Nicole Brantley.

1498
02:28:38,299 --> 02:28:41,642
So I'm just curious, how are the student reps

1499
02:28:43,134 --> 02:28:44,875
brought here when they're here?

1500
02:28:44,915 --> 02:28:47,136
Are they on a certain?

1501
02:28:47,677 --> 02:28:51,019
Dr. Cushing works to gain as many student rights as possible.

1502
02:28:51,039 --> 02:28:53,060
Yeah, I'm just curious how they're requested to be here.

1503
02:28:53,100 --> 02:28:54,621
Sometimes they're here, sometimes they're not.

1504
02:28:54,921 --> 02:28:55,662
Are they?

1505
02:28:57,043 --> 02:28:59,644
So generally speaking, they are here.

1506
02:29:00,004 --> 02:29:02,386
I think this is actually only the third meeting that they've missed.

1507
02:29:02,446 --> 02:29:04,367
We have four.

1508
02:29:04,747 --> 02:29:07,209
Generally speaking, I meet with them the Thursday or the Friday before.

1509
02:29:07,349 --> 02:29:08,690
I review the agenda with them.

1510
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:10,551
I see which one will be able to be here.

1511
02:29:11,684 --> 02:29:14,925
At the start of the year, I reach out to the principals to be able to select them.

1512
02:29:15,105 --> 02:29:26,209
They're part of the overall superintendents advisory committee that has about 30 named students, generally speaking attendance in the 15 to 20s with our meetings of a rotation of when students can be there.

1513
02:29:26,249 --> 02:29:32,811
We're trying to make those meetings during the school day, but really trying to give students, these students to be the opportunity to really be the voice.

1514
02:29:34,211 --> 02:29:40,093
And we expanded it because in previous years we had had, we had limited participation.

1515
02:29:40,977 --> 02:29:47,279
It's actually at five right now because Gabby Puccio is back on board with us as well.

1516
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:52,360
So it's Gabby, Noah, Dom, Melanie, and Dawn.

1517
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:58,001
Sorry, just trying to remember what their- Yes, thank you for all your hard work trying to- Yeah.

1518
02:29:58,021 --> 02:30:04,803
I was just curious how they ended up here sometimes and like not, which makes sense, of course, because obviously everybody has other things to do too.

1519
02:30:05,163 --> 02:30:08,044
So then my only other question is, obviously,

1520
02:30:09,369 --> 02:30:14,891
in the public participation part can, I mean, I've seen the minors come up before.

1521
02:30:15,071 --> 02:30:16,592
Students could always present too.

1522
02:30:16,712 --> 02:30:28,436
So could maybe that part of the agenda be just changed, adjusted to say public, you know, obviously they're part of the public, but so then you don't need a whole other space for them?

1523
02:30:29,436 --> 02:30:30,657
That makes so much sense.

1524
02:30:30,897 --> 02:30:31,997
We could do that.

1525
02:30:32,017 --> 02:30:33,718
It's up to member Hayes.

1526
02:30:33,838 --> 02:30:35,899
I think that's the first time anybody said I've made sense of it.

1527
02:30:38,393 --> 02:30:38,973
Member Hayes.

1528
02:30:39,354 --> 02:30:40,254
Well, I'd like you to go.

1529
02:30:40,294 --> 02:30:47,018
I think I would like you to go, since this is something that we brought up during school committee, I would like you to go to the subcommittee and we can discuss it there.

1530
02:30:47,818 --> 02:30:50,960
Motion to move the topic to the DEI subcommittee.

1531
02:30:52,021 --> 02:30:54,442
Member, by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hayes.

1532
02:30:54,762 --> 02:30:55,603
All those in favor?

1533
02:30:55,623 --> 02:30:56,043
Aye.

1534
02:30:56,303 --> 02:30:57,104
All those opposed?

1535
02:30:57,204 --> 02:30:58,764
Motion is approved.

1536
02:31:08,442 --> 02:31:15,487
Selection of school committee, three representatives for the Desi district review focus group during the first week of April, 2023 offered by Dr. Edward Vincent.

1537
02:31:18,962 --> 02:31:19,722
So good evening.

1538
02:31:19,742 --> 02:31:31,808
In preparation for our district review, DESE would like us to have, DESE would like to have at least two or three members that would participate and be part of the review.

1539
02:31:33,088 --> 02:31:35,809
It's scheduled to take place that first week of April.

1540
02:31:35,829 --> 02:31:41,412
So we don't have all of the specific information, but I just wanted to put it out there to all.

1541
02:31:41,972 --> 02:31:52,095
of the members and find out if there was any interest, or if your work schedule would permit you to be available to be part of the DSEE review.

1542
02:31:52,855 --> 02:31:55,256
And if there's a member McLaughlin, you're interested?

1543
02:31:56,216 --> 02:31:58,957
I would like to know what the time commitment is, but I need to leave now.

1544
02:31:59,237 --> 02:32:01,758
It's probably one hour, Dr. Cushing, do you know?

1545
02:32:01,838 --> 02:32:02,638
One hour, two hour?

1546
02:32:02,658 --> 02:32:04,479
90 minutes.

1547
02:32:04,499 --> 02:32:05,959
90 minutes, a 90 minute commitment.

1548
02:32:06,319 --> 02:32:06,620
Okay.

1549
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:07,600
During the work week day?

1550
02:32:07,880 --> 02:32:09,280
During the school day, yes.

1551
02:32:09,320 --> 02:32:11,301
So that's member McLaughlin, anyone else?

1552
02:32:14,679 --> 02:32:18,084
I'm happy to do it if you don't, unless a committee member wants, would be too.

1553
02:32:19,526 --> 02:32:20,227
Yeah, yeah.

1554
02:32:21,008 --> 02:32:26,956
Okay, so we'll have Mayor McLaughlin, Member Graham, and Mayor just in case as a backup.

1555
02:32:26,976 --> 02:32:28,178
Thank you so much.

1556
02:32:28,859 --> 02:32:29,199
Thank you.

1557
02:32:30,081 --> 02:32:30,281
Mayor.

1558
02:32:31,013 --> 02:32:31,713
Member Stone.

1559
02:32:32,734 --> 02:32:39,577
I might've missed it for old business, but last week the student rep Noah had brought up about the locked bathrooms.

1560
02:32:39,657 --> 02:32:54,023
And I don't remember if there was gonna be a follow-up about the schedule of the bathrooms, locked bathrooms, or just to respond to Noah's inquiry about when they're locked or when they're unlocked.

1561
02:32:55,053 --> 02:32:57,555
I can have another presentation.

1562
02:32:57,595 --> 02:33:02,018
I can have a update on bathrooms at our next meeting.

1563
02:33:02,218 --> 02:33:03,299
Okay, great.

1564
02:33:03,419 --> 02:33:03,799
Thank you.

1565
02:33:04,660 --> 02:33:12,305
And on that point, I think it's good to make sure just that the students know which ones, and I know we have our ones near the cafeterias back online.

1566
02:33:12,445 --> 02:33:16,128
So that's important to me, making sure the students know which are open when.

1567
02:33:17,469 --> 02:33:23,833
So I'd be happy just to get that information by email that it went out to students rather than a presentation, but I don't know what the student wants.

1568
02:33:24,721 --> 02:33:24,941
Yeah.

1569
02:33:25,161 --> 02:33:29,024
I think that would be an email to students with the schedule and which bathrooms would be great.

1570
02:33:29,284 --> 02:33:29,424
Yeah.

1571
02:33:29,484 --> 02:33:29,764
Okay.

1572
02:33:29,944 --> 02:33:32,886
We could, if I could just see it, I'd be good without a presentation.

1573
02:33:33,166 --> 02:33:34,107
Okay.

1574
02:33:34,267 --> 02:33:36,168
Myself member Russo.

1575
02:33:37,649 --> 02:33:40,631
I know we get told this stuff, but some things don't stick in my brain.

1576
02:33:40,711 --> 02:33:53,739
Like how many bathrooms there are per floor and how many are open and when, um, because sometimes when we get assertions that there's only two bathrooms open at any moment, any, at any moment in time in the high school,

1577
02:33:54,520 --> 02:33:58,922
If you tell me there's only two bathrooms open, I'm going to have a lot to say.

1578
02:34:00,143 --> 02:34:03,885
Because kids are still not having anything to drink in the morning or eating in the morning.

1579
02:34:04,746 --> 02:34:09,768
It used to be because they weren't really thrilled with what they would find when they went in the bathrooms.

1580
02:34:11,029 --> 02:34:12,610
A crowd of kids.

1581
02:34:13,979 --> 02:34:15,660
and they wouldn't necessarily feel safe.

1582
02:34:16,261 --> 02:34:19,784
Now it's because they're worried they won't be able to find a bathroom.

1583
02:34:20,805 --> 02:34:35,236
I mean, there was just in our daily email that this is being brought up in other places, not just Massachusetts, where kids should have a right to be able to go to the bathroom without missing out on substantial portions of their education.

1584
02:34:36,077 --> 02:34:43,063
And if there's a line of kids and they're spending five, 10, 15 minutes of a class waiting to go to the bathroom,

1585
02:34:44,224 --> 02:34:47,986
we are depriving them of their education so that we can have closed bathrooms.

1586
02:34:48,687 --> 02:34:58,973
And that's, it's being actually the article I'll send to you superintendent is really is from a civil rights perspective.

1587
02:34:59,153 --> 02:35:01,874
Like we were, these kids have a right to an education.

1588
02:35:02,715 --> 02:35:07,798
And if they happen to have had a good old fashioned American breakfast, they're screwed.

1589
02:35:09,155 --> 02:35:13,036
you know, so that I just want to make sure we get that level of detail in the email.

1590
02:35:13,517 --> 02:35:18,379
Cause I think, um, you don't want six or seven additional emails after you send yours.

1591
02:35:18,739 --> 02:35:18,799
Yep.

1592
02:35:18,819 --> 02:35:19,159
Thank you.

1593
02:35:19,979 --> 02:35:20,439
That sounds great.

1594
02:35:20,459 --> 02:35:20,779
Thank you.

1595
02:35:22,260 --> 02:35:23,781
Um, no reports requested.

1596
02:35:23,821 --> 02:35:25,741
We have number 10 condolences.

1597
02:35:25,881 --> 02:35:35,045
The Medford school committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of former city counselor, Robert L Maloney, senior father of athletic director, Bob Maloney,

1598
02:35:35,899 --> 02:35:44,823
Councilor Maloney served the city for over 25 years, as well as being an active member of the Medford Kiwanis Club, the Irish American Club, and the Medford Elks Club.

1599
02:35:46,364 --> 02:35:58,450
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Rosetta DeVita, aunt of city councilor and former school committee member, George Scarpelli, and Lisa Charay, a teacher at the Roberts Elementary School.

1600
02:35:59,571 --> 02:36:03,853
And the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Paul Howard,

1601
02:36:04,477 --> 02:36:13,702
owner of Jim's Market in North Medford and a former Providence College D1 basketball player, United States Army veteran and longtime supporter of the Medford community.

1602
02:36:14,302 --> 02:36:19,705
Often, Mr. Howard could be found playing basketball with the kids at Carr Park well into his 50s.

1603
02:36:20,266 --> 02:36:27,910
During the blizzard of 78, Mr. Howard made sure the elderly residents around Jim's Market had food items until they could get to the supermarket.

1604
02:36:28,110 --> 02:36:29,871
If we all may rise for a moment of silence, please.

1605
02:36:42,332 --> 02:36:42,632
Thank you.

1606
02:36:42,692 --> 02:36:49,679
Our next regularly scheduled meeting is March 20, 2023, here at the Alden Chambers, as well as on Zoom.

1607
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:52,902
Have a wonderful rest of the week, everybody.

1608
02:36:53,002 --> 02:36:54,644
Motion to adjourn by Member McLaughlin.
