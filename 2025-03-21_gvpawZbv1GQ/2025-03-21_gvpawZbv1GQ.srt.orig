[SPEAKER_06]: Why don't you just take it away, Larry?

41
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:14,529
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something else.

42
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:19,212
[SPEAKER_06]: It's giving us feedback.

43
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:21,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Stand by, please, while the people out back.

44
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:22,575

[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize.

47
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:30,820
[SPEAKER_06]: They're working on this out back.

48
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:33,182
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

49
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:35,223

[SPEAKER_06]: This is the public hearing for those in favor of the drive-thru.

51
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:40,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

52
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,688
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Karen Johnson.

53
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,031
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a resident of Arlington, Mass.

54
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:50,455
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here tonight on behalf of Felsway Property, which is located on Riverside Avenue.

55
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:52,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Address, please.

56
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:55,539
[SPEAKER_01]: 88 Woodside Lane in Arlington, Mass.

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:56,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

58
00:03:57,283 --> 00:03:57,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

59
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:01,707
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, members of the Council.

60
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:12,937
[SPEAKER_01]: We first appeared before you approximately a year ago, pretty close to a year ago this evening, when the Nor'easter that evening was a snowstorm.

61
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:19,924
[SPEAKER_01]: We met before the Committee of the Whole to introduce ourselves to you as the new owners of Felsway Plaza.

62
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:32,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the time, we reviewed our proposals for improvements to the plaza, including facade renovations and the exciting news for new tenants.

63
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:38,704
[SPEAKER_01]: And we briefly discussed at the time our proposal for a restaurant pad along Riverside.

64
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:41,885
[SPEAKER_01]: During our introduction, we

65
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:49,887
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to assure you that when we represented something to a community that we followed through.

66
00:04:50,187 --> 00:05:06,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hope that you certainly and the residents of Medford are very pleased with the results of our facade renovations and see the investments that we've so far made in a very outdated and underutilized property.

67
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,303
[SPEAKER_01]: We are very excited about the progress that we have made so far.

68
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:19,316
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot happening out there that you don't see and it results in significant investment in the infrastructure for Felsway Plaza.

69
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:26,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the continuation of that is the proposed restaurant pad along Riverside.

70
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:35,825
[SPEAKER_01]: We presented our application for special permit for site plan review to the Community Development Board in August and received approval from them at the time.

71
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:46,253
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here before you this evening for the application for the drive-through for the Panera use, which of course is a special permit before the city council.

72
00:05:47,153 --> 00:06:04,276
[SPEAKER_01]: The Panera, and shown on the plan and in your application materials, is tenant A, and we're very excited to have Panera and Smashburger, which recently received Common Vic and I believe also a liquor license from the council,

73
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:20,230
[SPEAKER_01]: and then Noodles as Tenant C. Through the process of our approvals before the Community Development Board, we also had an opportunity to meet with several of the neighbors along the 4th Street neighborhood.

74
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:28,997
[SPEAKER_01]: They had raised some concerns about the general overall condition of the property, and specifically, they had concerns related to odor control.

75
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:46,478
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very pleased that so far our tenants have agreed through the process of receiving the Common Vic license from the city council to employ additional odor control mechanisms and our other tenants are also amenable to that as well.

76
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:57,182
[SPEAKER_01]: So we think that we've presented a great plan for Fells Lake Plaza, a great plan for this property and we have

77
00:06:57,838 --> 00:07:06,680
[SPEAKER_01]: opened a line of communication with the neighbors in the area, which I believe really was not existent before we took title to the property.

78
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:16,082
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hope that you find this along the same lines as the balance of our work that we've done in Medford.

79
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:21,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Joining me this evening in the event you have any questions are Ken Staffia, our civil engineer from

80
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,723
[SPEAKER_01]: VHB, and also Pat Dunford, who is our traffic engineer, also from VHB.

81
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:37,188
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sorry to report that our attorney, Bob Abruzzi, has had a medical issue, and he is not able to be present this evening.

82
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:47,954
[SPEAKER_01]: So we will try to answer as many questions as you can, but think that we may have to continue some portion of this matter until Bob can be present.

83
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any questions?

84
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

85
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,981
[SPEAKER_06]: The public hearing is still open.

86
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:59,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else in favour?

87
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:03,103
[SPEAKER_12]: I promised her I'd get up here and just say I'm in favour.

88
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:03,523
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

89
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:05,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else in favour?

90
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:11,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Hearing and seeing none, I now close that portion of the hearing and open it up to anybody in opposition.

91
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:23,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

92
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:24,787
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kristen Bartlett.

93
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:28,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I currently reside at 488 Riverside Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts.

94
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:32,013
[SPEAKER_00]: So I live right across the street from the project.

95
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:35,937
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit concerned about a few different aspects.

96
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:43,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, with the stop and shop being there and a few other, you know, real retail, excuse me, spaces.

97
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:51,785
[SPEAKER_00]: It does get quite noisy, and we do encounter a lot of traffic getting in and out of our driveway, parking on the street.

98
00:08:52,886 --> 00:08:54,848
[SPEAKER_00]: My house is usually blocked off.

99
00:08:54,908 --> 00:09:06,339
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm usually asking someone at least once or twice a week, and I keep normal business hours for work to move their vehicle so that I can park in front of my house and not have to walk a block or so with my four-year-old.

100
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:21,041
[SPEAKER_00]: I really oppose having an exit for this establishment on Riverside Avenue just due to the traffic that we do encounter with the exit just about a block or so up from our home.

101
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:26,646
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult to turn in and out, very difficult to get onto the street.

102
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:33,752
[SPEAKER_00]: The infrastructure I don't think really supports making a drive-through establishment right there.

103
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:38,673
[SPEAKER_00]: people aren't paying attention when they come in and out, so it's a little bit difficult.

104
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:53,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, and I guess, again, I don't know whether this has been established or not, the hours for this, with the Dunkin' Donuts being at that set of lights, it's hard enough to get past the McGlynn School to get to the highway on a daily basis.

105
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:03,171
[SPEAKER_06]: So you are not in favor?

106
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:03,631
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

107
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:04,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

108
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody else not in favor of this project?

109
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in favor of this project?

110
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:15,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing and hearing none, I now close that portion of the public hearing.

111
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,461
[SPEAKER_06]: And are we waiting for the attorney or are you proceeding?

112
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:24,479
[SPEAKER_06]: I know your attorney wanted to wait until the 23rd.

113
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,960
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to wait for the 23rd.

114
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

115
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

116
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the attorney wants to be here to answer the questions.

117
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:30,921
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

118
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:33,102
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the will of the council, whatever the council wants.

119
00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:34,522
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor DelaRusso.

120
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:45,206
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd recommend that in the absence of their legal counsel and representation that we defer this till that time in which it can be.

121
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:46,566
[SPEAKER_16]: So I motion to table.

122
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:48,967
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion for table, which is undebatable,

123
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,920
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

124
00:10:55,882 --> 00:10:58,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the attorney asked, and they have legal representation.

125
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:03,886
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion to table on the floor.

126
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:04,826
[SPEAKER_06]: The clerk will call the roll.

127
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:13,710
[SPEAKER_06]: And till end, the motion is till the 23rd.

128
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that correct or not?

129
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,774
[SPEAKER_16]: Was that the data indicated by council?

130
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:19,294
[SPEAKER_16]: I received a message from him today.

131
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:19,534
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

132
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:25,737
[SPEAKER_16]: He asked that consideration be made and I don't see any, I know there was a very interesting group of neighbors.

133
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:29,198
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a motion to table, so I don't want to cut you off, councilor, but there's a motion to table.

134
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:30,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

135
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:31,058
[SPEAKER_16]: On my motion.

136
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,179
[SPEAKER_06]: On Councilor De La Russo's motion.

137
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,039
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

138
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,060
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, we'll call the roll.

139
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,861
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Caviello.

140
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:38,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

141
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:40,121
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor De La Russo.

142
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:40,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

143
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:41,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

144
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:41,982

176
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:49,328
[SPEAKER_18]: As Chairman of the Board of Assessors, I am respectfully appearing before your honorable body tonight for the purpose of holding a public hearing to discuss the following items concerning the allocation of the fiscal year 2015 property tax.

177
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:53,229
[SPEAKER_18]: One, to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2015.

178
00:13:55,633 --> 00:14:05,578
[SPEAKER_18]: by selecting the minimum residential factor, a percentage of the total tax levy from the residential taxpayer to the commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

179
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:13,603
[SPEAKER_18]: This results in a lower tax rate for residential properties and a higher tax rate for commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

180
00:14:14,183 --> 00:14:17,225
[SPEAKER_18]: Historically, the council has chosen the minimum residential factor.

181
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:23,348
[SPEAKER_18]: If this is once again the council choice, the minimum residential factor is decimal point 899216.

182
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,796
[SPEAKER_18]: Two, to adopt an open space discount.

183
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:31,358
[SPEAKER_18]: This does not apply in the city of Medford, but a no vote is required.

184
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Number three, to adopt a residential exemption.

185
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:40,863
[SPEAKER_18]: If adopted, owner-occupied residential properties may receive an exemption of up to 20% of the average residential value.

186
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:48,307
[SPEAKER_18]: This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the tax levy from the owner-occupied residential properties to non-owner-occupied properties.

187
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:54,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Since this shift causes a higher residential tax rate, a number of owner-occupied properties would also see an increase

188
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:56,649
[SPEAKER_18]: in their tax bills.

189
00:14:57,369 --> 00:14:59,611
[SPEAKER_18]: Four, to adopt a small commercial exemption.

190
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:10,057
[SPEAKER_18]: If adopted, commercial properties housing a business employing 10 or less people and valued at less than a million dollars may receive an exemption of up to 10% of assessed value.

191
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:19,037
[SPEAKER_18]: This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the commercial industrial tax levy from these eligible properties to another commercial and or industrial properties.

192
00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:28,600
[SPEAKER_18]: Since this shift causes a higher commercial industrial tax rate, all commercial industrial not receiving the exemption would see an increase in their tax bills.

193
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,642
[SPEAKER_18]: As part of this hearing, it is the duty of the board of assessors to notify the council of any excess levy capacity.

194
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:38,605
[SPEAKER_18]: Fiscal year 2015, excess levy capacity is $57,657.67.

[SPEAKER_18]: Table of contents.

196
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,794
[SPEAKER_18]: Page one is the classification hearing and the residential factor.

197
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:57,039
[SPEAKER_18]: In accordance with the Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 369 of the Acts of 1982, Chapter 797 of the Acts of 1979 Classification Amendment,

198
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:08,799
[SPEAKER_18]: The city council will hold a public hearing to receive public input relative to the determination of the residential factor for fiscal year 2015.

199
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:17,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Under Massachusetts general laws, cities and towns are allowed to allocate or shift the tax burden between the various classes of property.

200
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:24,085
[SPEAKER_18]: The residential factor determines the allocation of the real and personal property burden to shift between various classes of property.

201
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:30,768
[SPEAKER_18]: By selecting a residential factor, you will also be deciding the respective tax rates for the real and personal property classes.

202
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:40,050
[SPEAKER_18]: The Department of Revenue has authorized the adoption of two rates, one for residential and open space classes, and one for commercial, industrial, and personal property classes.

203
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:44,074
[SPEAKER_18]: Page two is the tax levy limitation.

204
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Last year, fiscal 2014, the levy limit was 93,175,009.

205
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:53,907
[SPEAKER_18]: This year, that's a starting point for fiscal year 2015.

206
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,608
[SPEAKER_18]: The addition of 2.5% is $2,329,375.

207
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,711
[SPEAKER_18]: Fiscal 2015 new growth is $999,941 for a total of $96,504,325 is the 2015 levy limit.

208
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:01,233
[SPEAKER_18]: Page three is the minimum residential factor computation.

209
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,253
[SPEAKER_18]: It shows the breakdown of the

210
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:30,062
[SPEAKER_18]: Percentage by class, residential class comprises of 88%, 1539% of the city, and the commercial industrial personal property is 11%, 11.8461%.

211
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:33,823
[SPEAKER_18]: Go through the calculations, you come up with a minimum residential factor of 93.281.

212
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:38,125
[SPEAKER_18]: Page four is the calculation of the lowest possible residential factor.

213
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,174
[SPEAKER_18]: The last year's chosen residential percentage was 78.1091%.

214
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:53,657
[SPEAKER_18]: Using a 150 shift would be 93.2810 with the minimum residential share, but the 150 shift is 82.2308%.

215
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:56,258
[SPEAKER_18]: To calculate the residential factor using a 175% shift to CIP, it's 89.9215%.

216
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:58,480
[SPEAKER_18]: Multiply that by the residential factor,

217
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:27,830
[SPEAKER_18]: of the full and fair cash value residential percentage is 79.2693%, the lowest historical residential percentage since its first ratification, I believe it was 1980, 72.1010%.

218
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:36,297
[SPEAKER_18]: Page five is the classification options, starting with the single,

219
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:42,035
[SPEAKER_18]: A single tax rate based on the values in the levy of $13 and one cent.

220
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:56,060
[SPEAKER_18]: That will be a factor of 1.00 and that will be for all classes of property going all the way down the matrix to the max at 175% which would give it projected as $11 and 70 cents for residential and 22.77 for CIP.

221
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,280
[SPEAKER_18]: Page six.

222
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:06,947
[SPEAKER_18]: is the LA-4, which is the valuation.

223
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:17,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Department of Revenue LA-4 form, breaking down by class of property on the left-hand side, number of parcels, and the total value for this fiscal year.

224
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,913
[SPEAKER_18]: Page seven is the valuation summary.

225
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:30,256
[SPEAKER_18]: Fiscal year 2005, the total value of the city from last year to this year went up 9.36%.

226
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:36,825
[SPEAKER_18]: Next page is the breakdown by class.

227
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:45,892
[SPEAKER_18]: Single families went up 8%, condominiums went up 10%, two families went up 13%, three families went up 14%.

228
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:50,896
[SPEAKER_18]: The twos and threes went up the most of this fiscal year.

229
00:19:51,397 --> 00:19:56,821
[SPEAKER_18]: It reflects the mirror of 2004 values when the market went through the roof.

230
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:03,770
[SPEAKER_18]: Apartments, small apartments, 48% and the larger complexes went up 18%.

231
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,532
[SPEAKER_18]: Commercial, 3% and industrial at 4%.

232
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:11,374
[SPEAKER_18]: Page eight is a new growth.

233
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:14,296
[SPEAKER_18]: New growth is part of the levy limit.

234
00:20:15,196 --> 00:20:17,457
[SPEAKER_18]: New growth was certified today at 999,941.

235
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:22,220
[SPEAKER_18]: Page nine is the scenario.

236
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,862
[SPEAKER_18]: If you use the minimum residential factor,

237
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:29,934
[SPEAKER_18]: what the average increase in value would be.

238
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:34,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Average increase for a single family would be $394,500.

239
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:35,477
[SPEAKER_18]: The average condominium is $294,600.

240
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,238
[SPEAKER_18]: The average two family is $458,000.

241
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:39,240
[SPEAKER_18]: The average three family is $545,900.

242
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,601
[SPEAKER_18]: The average commercial industrial is $1,098,400.

243
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,903
[SPEAKER_18]: So if the council adopted the minimum residential factor,

244
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,899
[SPEAKER_18]: The average increase for a single family would be $128.47.

245
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:02,461
[SPEAKER_18]: The average for a condominium would be $105.02.

246
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:07,183
[SPEAKER_18]: And the average of a two-family would be $3.74.08.

247
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:10,765
[SPEAKER_18]: Two-family.

248
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:12,106
[SPEAKER_18]: Average three-family would be $5.13.16.

249
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:17,308
[SPEAKER_18]: And the average commercial industrial would only see an increase of $2.90 to $2.27.

250
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:24,572
[SPEAKER_18]: So again, the increase would be in the twos and three-families based on the valuation increases.

251
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:39,443
[SPEAKER_18]: Page 9-1 is the scenario for a single tax rate and the possible increases to the residential class versus the commercial class.

252
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:46,527
[SPEAKER_18]: Page 10 is the fiscal year 2015 tax rates from surrounding cities and towns.

253
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,388
[SPEAKER_18]: There aren't many in yet.

254
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,848
[SPEAKER_18]: It's probably two-thirds.

255
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:56,612
[SPEAKER_18]: Once again, Bedford, as proposed, would be around the third or fourth lowest residential tax rate.

256
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:18,127
[SPEAKER_18]: If the council adopts that page 11 is page one, two, three, four of the recap and page 12 would be the residential exemption applies to all residential owner occupied properties, non owner occupy occupied properties would be excluded.

257
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:25,913
[SPEAKER_18]: This means any real property used for residential purposes, um, including apartment buildings in which the owner does not have a permanent residency address.

258
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:33,044
[SPEAKER_18]: Lots adjacent to and owned by owner-occupied real property would also be excluded.

259
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:38,148
[SPEAKER_18]: The residential exemption is a class exemption to the residential portion of the tax base only.

260
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:44,012
[SPEAKER_18]: It does not have anything to do with various social economic status of a taxpayer.

261
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:46,714
[SPEAKER_18]: It's based on the fair cash value of real property in the city.

262
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:52,439
[SPEAKER_18]: Fiscal year 2015 assessments based on January 1, 2014 assessment date.

263
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,320
[SPEAKER_18]: With this information in mind,

264
00:22:55,049 --> 00:23:12,414
[SPEAKER_18]: We must be aware that all, uh, all owner occupied properties with the total assessed value of four, four, five, 46, 400 and above will be the recipient of the exemption if it's owner occupied, but because of the higher tax rate involved will actually pay more in taxes than they would without the exemption.

265
00:23:13,295 --> 00:23:17,496
[SPEAKER_18]: The local option in the residential exemption must either be approved or disapproved by a council vote.

266
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:20,417
[SPEAKER_18]: The percentage allowable by law is anywhere up to 10 to 20%.

267
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:26,246
[SPEAKER_18]: Communities that receive special legislation can exceed the 20% maximum.

268
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:37,913
[SPEAKER_18]: If the resident owner for any reason is not granted the exemption and can prove honor occupancy on January 1, 2014, an application must be timely filed and an approved exemption will be granted.

269
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:40,955
[SPEAKER_18]: These funds are deducted from the overlay reserves.

270
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:47,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Affiliates who file it properly and timely will result in the denial of any and all exemptions.

271
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Next page is the Department of Revenue breakdown.

272
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:55,359
[SPEAKER_18]: for the residential, to explain the residential exemption.

273
00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:04,081
[SPEAKER_18]: A municipality can grant a residential exemption of a dollar amount that cannot exceed 20% of the average assessed value on our residential class properties.

274
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:09,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Communities that receive special legislation can exceed the 20% maximum.

275
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:19,785
[SPEAKER_18]: The exemption reduces by the adopted percentage, the taxable valuation of each residential parcel that is a taxpayer's principal residence.

276
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:30,259
[SPEAKER_18]: Granting the exemption raises the residential tax rate and shifts the residential burden from moderately or lower valued homes to apartments, summer homes and higher valued homes.

277
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:37,384
[SPEAKER_18]: A residential exemption is one way resort areas, Cape Cod and the Berkshires can provide some tax relief for permanent residents.

278
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:43,068
[SPEAKER_18]: Next page is the number of communities that have adopted it.

279
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:48,992
[SPEAKER_18]: 13 communities.

280
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:50,938
[SPEAKER_18]: We have adopted it so far.

281
00:24:51,998 --> 00:24:53,299
[SPEAKER_18]: The next page is the impact.

282
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,802
[SPEAKER_18]: If it was adopted at 20%, 15%, and 10%, the valuation reduction for 20% would be 80,379.

283
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:57,322
[SPEAKER_18]: For 15% would be 60,284.

284
00:24:57,402 --> 00:24:58,563
[SPEAKER_18]: For 10% would be 40,189.

285
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:18,906
[SPEAKER_18]: And the important part to note here, as I stated earlier, was the 546, 400, 543, 800, 546, 300 would be the cutoff.

286
00:25:18,926 --> 00:25:24,328
[SPEAKER_18]: So anybody paying more than that would, assessed more than that would be paying more in taxes if owner-occupied.

287
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:31,511
[SPEAKER_18]: There would be 1,278 parcels that would pay more as owner-occupied for 20%, for 15% would be 13, 18, for 10% would be 12, 79 would pay more in taxes.

288
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:54,394
[SPEAKER_18]: Next page is the breakdown, uh, the actual formula and calculation to see what a number of owner occupied properties to date that we have on file is 12,032 and the various scenarios, um, the dollar and tax dollar amounts by 20, 15, and 10%.

289
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:59,815
[SPEAKER_18]: Next page is the residential exemption breakdown.

290
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:01,916
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, we have 15,259 residential properties.

291
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:10,678
[SPEAKER_18]: 74%, 12,032 are owner occupied.

292
00:26:11,378 --> 00:26:16,800
[SPEAKER_18]: We have a number of trusts that we could not ascertain ownership, 882.

293
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:20,342
[SPEAKER_18]: We have 268 unknown owner occupied.

294
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:26,705
[SPEAKER_18]: We have 2,309 non-owner occupied, and that's an estimated number.

295
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:30,187
[SPEAKER_18]: And then residential land and accessory parcels are not included, 768.

296
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:34,759
[SPEAKER_18]: for a total of 16 to 59 in the residential class.

297
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,421
[SPEAKER_18]: Next page is a small commercial exemption.

298
00:26:38,322 --> 00:26:42,224
[SPEAKER_18]: The various scenarios adopting yet with no exemption, 1%, 5%, 10%.

299
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:52,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councilor Lungo-Kern and then Councilor Knight.

300
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I do have some questions, thanks.

301
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:57,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

302
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:58,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to wait, Councillor?

303
00:26:58,521 --> 00:26:59,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Your light was on.

304
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:00,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to wait?

305
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:00,582
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no.

306
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:01,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I can ask a few questions.

307
00:27:02,182 --> 00:27:05,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for the— Point of information, Councillor Dela Ruccio.

308
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:21,065
[SPEAKER_16]: Just in the interest of public safety, the ceiling on the west side of this room is leaking, and I'd urge people not to stand on that side of the room, as it appears from this angle that a patched portion of the ceiling is beginning to sag and may give way.

309
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:23,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you step away from that, sir?

310
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to disturb, Councilor.

311
00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:30,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor.

312
00:27:30,574 --> 00:27:33,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Longo-Kerr, as everyone looks up for the sale of the book.

313
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:34,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Just checking it out, OK.

314
00:27:36,076 --> 00:27:37,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Camuso.

315
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:41,137
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Ed, for the brief summary.

316
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:49,280
[SPEAKER_09]: The local receipts not allocated, the recap, I'm not sure we went over this in detail in our subcommittee meeting.

317
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we just go over a few of the figures on that?

318
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,041
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

319
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:56,282
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd probably have to defer to Finance Director Baker on that.

320
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:56,622
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

321
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:06,954
[SPEAKER_09]: The first would be the $300,000 difference from the penalties and interest on taxes and excises from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015.

322
00:28:06,994 --> 00:28:12,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Anne, could you address that?

323
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:16,057
[SPEAKER_19]: Estimated receipts.

324
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:23,119
[SPEAKER_19]: Name and address for the record.

325
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:25,419
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we just get your name and title?

326
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:27,400
[SPEAKER_23]: Anne Baker, the finance director of the city of Medford.

327
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:29,278
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't hear what you said.

328
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:30,719
[SPEAKER_09]: What item were you questioning?

329
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:35,660
[SPEAKER_09]: The page before is marked as 11, so it would be like 11B, I guess.

330
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,881
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, what item?

331
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:41,261
[SPEAKER_23]: Penalties and interest on taxes and excises.

332
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:46,702
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, that's because there was a particularly large tax title parcel came in last year.

333
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,743
[SPEAKER_23]: I think the interest on it was over $300,000.

334
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:56,685
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't remember the actual property address that it was, but that won't be repeated.

335
00:28:58,162 --> 00:29:00,003
[SPEAKER_23]: So it was a large new build?

336
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:05,785
[SPEAKER_23]: It was a large tax title property, a large property that had been in tax title for a number of years that was redeemed.

337
00:29:11,008 --> 00:29:16,390
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the next one, payment in lieu of taxes, how come that is increased?

338
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,591
[SPEAKER_23]: Right.

339
00:29:17,651 --> 00:29:25,855
[SPEAKER_23]: The MVDC payment that was supposed to come in that was a new payment for fiscal 14 did not come in until fiscal 15.

340
00:29:27,052 --> 00:29:29,153
[SPEAKER_23]: So that will be budgeted for fiscal 15.

341
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:30,514
[SPEAKER_23]: That was $166,000.

342
00:29:30,954 --> 00:29:34,896
[SPEAKER_23]: Then we will get that same amount that is due for fiscal 15, which is $166,000.

343
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:38,838
[SPEAKER_23]: And then there's a new payment due for fiscal 15 of another $107,000.

344
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:47,982
[SPEAKER_09]: And then number 10, fees.

345
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:50,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Another significant difference.

346
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:53,525
[SPEAKER_23]: Number 10, the fees.

347
00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:56,227
[SPEAKER_23]: That has to do with the cable fees.

348
00:29:58,768 --> 00:30:06,512
[SPEAKER_23]: We get about $400,000 a year from Comcast, and we get about $200,000 a year from Verizon.

349
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:09,674
[SPEAKER_23]: So that'll be the $600,000 budgeted for fiscal 15.

350
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:13,315
[SPEAKER_23]: And the last year, sometimes their payments go into the wrong year.

351
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:15,236
[SPEAKER_23]: If they're late, they go into the wrong year.

352
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:18,138
[SPEAKER_23]: So last year, one of the payments went into the wrong year, went into the previous year.

353
00:30:18,678 --> 00:30:19,699
[SPEAKER_23]: So it was lower last year.

354
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,220
[SPEAKER_23]: So that's the fee that's supposed to be used for

355
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:24,694
[SPEAKER_23]: the three public TV stations?

356
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:25,875
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, right.

357
00:30:26,015 --> 00:30:27,696
[SPEAKER_23]: No, no, no, these aren't the TV3.

358
00:30:27,716 --> 00:30:29,517
[SPEAKER_23]: These are the fees that come into the city.

359
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:32,338
[SPEAKER_23]: The franchise fee, the 3% franchise fee.

360
00:30:36,921 --> 00:30:39,482
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a separate fee from what we usually use for TV3?

361
00:30:39,522 --> 00:30:40,863
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a separate fee?

362
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:43,765
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, it's a separate fee, right.

363
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:49,228
[SPEAKER_23]: So 3%- That fee is now being kept in a separate fund when the TV3 issue is resolved, I guess.

364
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:53,295
[SPEAKER_09]: So but that separate fee is coming out at three percent.

365
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:59,580
[SPEAKER_23]: It's just held separately No, that does it three as a three percent fee that we get for the franchise fee is a local receipt.

366
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:15,170
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always been a local receipt Point of information counselor Penta and there's two separate accounts One that has a public access account that it has in excess of three hundred thousand dollars That's the that's the TV field TV three money, right?

367
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,011
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's another account

368
00:31:17,995 --> 00:31:20,637
[SPEAKER_03]: where Verizon and Comcast pay a percentage.

369
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:21,938
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, and that's this account here.

370
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:22,559
[SPEAKER_23]: That's this account here.

371
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:23,379
[SPEAKER_23]: Verizon and Comcast.

372
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:25,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so they are two separate accounts.

373
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:25,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

374
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:26,442
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not one.

375
00:31:27,923 --> 00:31:32,767
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha, okay, and then number 16, departmental revenue.

376
00:31:33,107 --> 00:31:38,972
[SPEAKER_23]: That is, the excess on that is the guaranteed portion of the new parking fees.

377
00:31:40,293 --> 00:31:43,535
[SPEAKER_23]: We're guaranteed to get at least six months worth of a $25,000 per month fee in this coming year.

378
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:50,850
[SPEAKER_23]: regardless of what else happens.

379
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:56,157
[SPEAKER_23]: So we've put in that guaranteed fee as an additional excess departmental revenue.

380
00:31:56,897 --> 00:31:59,861
[SPEAKER_23]: And then number 23, miscellaneous, non-recurring.

381
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:04,146
[SPEAKER_23]: The 23, that was FEMA money from the prior year.

382
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:04,847
[SPEAKER_23]: That won't repeat.

383
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:07,083
[SPEAKER_23]: That was for potholes?

384
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:10,345
[SPEAKER_23]: I can't remember.

385
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:10,526
[SPEAKER_23]: FEMA?

386
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:11,426
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it was FEMA.

387
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,228
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the floods.

388
00:32:13,868 --> 00:32:14,449
[SPEAKER_23]: The floods, yeah.

389
00:32:14,469 --> 00:32:16,030
[SPEAKER_23]: We got money back from FEMA a few years ago.

390
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,151
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I can't remember what that was.

391
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:18,992
[SPEAKER_23]: It was from FEMA.

392
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:30,001
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we had mentioned in subcommittee that free cash for 2000, the last fiscal year,

393
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,148
[SPEAKER_23]: was about, we put a million dollars into free cash.

394
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:35,148
[SPEAKER_23]: Slightly less than a million.

395
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:45,350
[SPEAKER_23]: But that was almost all attributable, a large portion of that was attributable to the excess amount collected from motor vehicle excise in excess of what was budgeted.

396
00:32:46,571 --> 00:32:50,652
[SPEAKER_23]: I think 700,000 of that was because of that one item.

397
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:53,892
[SPEAKER_23]: Motor vehicle excise number one.

398
00:32:53,912 --> 00:32:55,833
[SPEAKER_23]: What was budgeted for 14 and what was collected in 14.

399
00:32:57,348 --> 00:32:58,389
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have that in front of you?

400
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:02,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we have number one, motor vehicle excise for $5,682,440.

401
00:33:02,492 --> 00:33:02,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

402
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:15,322
[SPEAKER_23]: So what was collected in 14 was significantly over what was budgeted in 14, which is what attributed that a large portion of that increase in free cash was attributable to that.

403
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,317
[SPEAKER_23]: So we don't expect that increase in 2015?

404
00:33:17,418 --> 00:33:19,640
[SPEAKER_23]: No, I think it's stable.

405
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,560
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, we can't tell.

406
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:30,469
[SPEAKER_23]: We really can only budget what we collected in the previous year unless we have evidence that it's going to be repeated.

407
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,031
[SPEAKER_23]: That was kind of.

408
00:33:32,191 --> 00:33:35,174
[SPEAKER_23]: And what was the figure again that it went over budget?

409
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:39,978
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it was more than half, like $600,000 maybe.

410
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:41,700
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd have to go back and get that last year's recap.

411
00:33:45,363 --> 00:34:06,261
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may put a motion through the chair, could we get figures by next week on how much was put into free cash in 2012, 2013, and how much has been put into free cash so far in 2000?

412
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I guess you wouldn't do that until the end of 2000.

413
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:09,744
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't do that until the end of the year.

414
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:12,986
[SPEAKER_23]: So just the last certification of free cash was as of June 30, 2014.

415
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:15,874
[SPEAKER_23]: So it would have been the results of operations.

416
00:34:16,174 --> 00:34:22,800
[SPEAKER_09]: So can you give me the last three, 2011, 2012, 2013, June figures for what was put into free cash?

417
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we get a copy of that?

418
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:25,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

419
00:34:25,722 --> 00:34:27,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have that, Mr. Clerk?

420
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:34,689
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the last year, the majority, I guess, came from motor vehicle excise.

421
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:35,810
[SPEAKER_09]: A large portion of it, yeah.

422
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,212
[SPEAKER_09]: And where did the additional?

423
00:34:38,432 --> 00:34:39,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have any idea?

424
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:43,376
[SPEAKER_23]: There was only a couple of hundred thousand dollars in unspent budgets.

425
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,361
[SPEAKER_23]: to the best of my recollection, that's right.

426
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:59,167
[SPEAKER_23]: The rest of it was all, the rest of it was, you know, minor items and other line items of local receipts, but those were the two major items.

427
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:02,069
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make me too much, because the excise revenue.

428
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:03,430
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good for questions right now.

429
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:04,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

430
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:07,172
[SPEAKER_13]: I have nothing to add, Councilor.

431
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:08,233
[SPEAKER_13]: The microphone was on, but.

432
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:11,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta.

433
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:13,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I missed it.

434
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:14,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we go back to number 10?

435
00:35:14,998 --> 00:35:15,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's Anne?

436
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:16,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 10.

437
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:21,539
[SPEAKER_03]: under fees, it went from 398 to 609?

438
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:21,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

439
00:35:25,602 --> 00:35:36,590
[SPEAKER_23]: Because something in the previous year, one of the items was posted in the wrong year, it was posted, it was like, sometimes they send in one check, and it's for two payments, and it went into the previous year.

440
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,272
[SPEAKER_23]: So the 609 is what we would normally get every year.

441
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:44,255
[SPEAKER_23]: We get about 400,000 from Comcast, and about 200,000 from Verizon.

442
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:47,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me get that straight.

443
00:35:49,328 --> 00:35:52,170
[SPEAKER_03]: If in fiscal 2014, you had 398.

444
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

445
00:35:54,791 --> 00:36:00,314
[SPEAKER_23]: Because something from Comcast got paid early.

446
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:03,995
[SPEAKER_23]: They paid us with one check right at the end of the year, and it got posted into the prior year.

447
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,157
[SPEAKER_03]: So then that got posted, what, in 2013?

448
00:36:07,357 --> 00:36:10,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

449
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,400
[SPEAKER_03]: On the same train of thought, can we get, for the years 11, 12, and 13,

450
00:36:18,873 --> 00:36:21,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Comcast what they paid and what Verizon paid.

451
00:36:21,274 --> 00:36:23,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have that, Eddie?

452
00:36:23,555 --> 00:36:25,536
[SPEAKER_03]: 11, 12, and 13 fiscal years.

453
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:34,920
[SPEAKER_23]: They tend to pay them right smack at the end of the year, so sometimes they get into the line, yeah.

454
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it looks like, and this is like, these numbers are really tight.

455
00:36:39,522 --> 00:36:43,223
[SPEAKER_03]: When you talk about Medicaid reimbursement, you're talking about less than $60,000?

456
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,151
[SPEAKER_03]: You go from 446, 628 to 447.

457
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:53,011
[SPEAKER_23]: That's just rounding.

458
00:36:53,031 --> 00:36:54,112
[SPEAKER_23]: We're assuming the same number.

459
00:36:54,132 --> 00:36:57,132
[SPEAKER_23]: We have no reason to suspect that it's going to be any higher.

460
00:36:57,493 --> 00:36:59,253
[SPEAKER_23]: We work with Shore Collaborative.

461
00:36:59,753 --> 00:37:07,976
[SPEAKER_23]: And Shore Collaborative generally gives us an estimate if they think there's something, if the federal government has changed their formula, or if they think we're going to get more money for some reason.

462
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:13,057
[SPEAKER_23]: Generally, it's because the federal government changed their formula, or something's timing has changed.

463
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,138
[SPEAKER_23]: But we've had no information from Shore to indicate that.

464
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:21,292
[SPEAKER_23]: anything extraordinary is gonna come in at 15, over and above what came in at 14.

465
00:37:22,093 --> 00:37:24,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And also under 23, which is miscellaneous.

466
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:25,916
[SPEAKER_03]: What number?

467
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:26,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Number 23.

468
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,217
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that was FEMA.

469
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:31,560
[SPEAKER_23]: That was FEMA money that came in at 14 that won't come in at 15.

470
00:37:33,081 --> 00:37:37,124
[SPEAKER_03]: So all our prior debt for last year's snowstorms and everything have been paid?

471
00:37:37,344 --> 00:37:37,864
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right, yeah.

472
00:37:39,185 --> 00:37:39,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

473
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:42,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we just go back?

474
00:37:45,273 --> 00:37:49,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Go back to that number 10, where you have Comcast and Verizon, and you have fees.

475
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:50,977
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get them for 11, 12, and 13.

476
00:37:51,277 --> 00:38:00,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And can you also give us the amount of money that was paid by the city of Medford to Channel 3 during those years, too?

477
00:38:01,263 --> 00:38:03,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I believe they have all the checks.

478
00:38:03,524 --> 00:38:04,505
[SPEAKER_23]: What was paid to them?

479
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:06,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, to the Medford Community Cable Access.

480
00:38:07,427 --> 00:38:08,748
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, we've been holding all those checks.

481
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:10,329
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, you're holding it, I believe,

482
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:11,599
[SPEAKER_03]: December of 2012.

483
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:19,226
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of 11 and mostly all of 12, you wrote checks, the city wrote checks.

484
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:21,247
[SPEAKER_23]: So you want to know what we paid to them during fiscal 11?

485
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:22,408
[SPEAKER_03]: 11 and 12.

486
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:23,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Fiscal 11 and 12, okay.

487
00:38:23,749 --> 00:38:24,430
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it stopped.

488
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,451
[SPEAKER_23]: I think, didn't we go over this one time before?

489
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:27,332
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we never got that.

490
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:31,836
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you gave us how much is sitting in the account, but I want to know what was paid.

491
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:32,596
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

492
00:38:32,616 --> 00:38:33,497
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, during the month of 2011,

493
00:38:35,123 --> 00:38:39,925
[SPEAKER_23]: Fiscal 2011, fiscal 12, how much was given to TV3, or whatever they were called at that time.

494
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:40,285
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

495
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,386
[SPEAKER_03]: You have that, Eddie?

496
00:38:42,426 --> 00:38:44,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got it.

497
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:46,367
OK.

498
00:38:47,188 --> 00:38:47,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other councilors?

499
00:38:47,948 --> 00:38:48,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions?

500
00:38:51,669 --> 00:38:52,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

501
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Camuso.

502
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,071
[SPEAKER_09]: The new growth, the 999,941,

503
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:07,629
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the dollar amount on that new development, the Lumiere apartments?

504
00:39:08,189 --> 00:39:10,511
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that had to be a large chunk of that?

505
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:19,577
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, for you, Mr. President, the property is under construction.

506
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:22,019
[SPEAKER_18]: So we pick up a part of the value this year.

507
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:24,060
[SPEAKER_18]: We get to pick up most of it for next year.

508
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,763
[SPEAKER_18]: I know they were occupied as of, I guess, August 2014.

509
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:29,804
[SPEAKER_18]: So that would be in the apartment growth.

510
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:36,845
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be the fourth, one, two, three, fourth line down on the second page.

511
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:38,026
[SPEAKER_18]: That's part of that.

512
00:39:38,046 --> 00:39:40,688
[SPEAKER_09]: What page are you on?

513
00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:42,409
[SPEAKER_18]: New growth form.

514
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,451
[SPEAKER_18]: Page eight.

515
00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:45,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Eight.

516
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:47,213
[SPEAKER_18]: The back page of it.

517
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:58,602
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be...

518
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,541
[SPEAKER_09]: Which section would that be, Ed?

519
00:40:09,582 --> 00:40:14,365
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be captured under multi-families.

520
00:40:15,786 --> 00:40:16,967
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be the last column.

521
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:20,370
[SPEAKER_09]: New growth valuation?

522
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:20,990
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

523
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:23,912
[SPEAKER_18]: It's part of that $7 million.

524
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:24,573
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, gotcha.

525
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:27,395
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll capture most of that next year.

526
00:40:29,717 --> 00:40:35,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And will we capture the new development at Station Landing Hotel?

527
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:36,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Will that be next year?

528
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:42,831
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the front parcel, that's for the hotel, yeah, we will.

529
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:51,373
[SPEAKER_18]: There's nothing done yet on that, just a change in the... No, I think it was actually commercial land before, so no, nothing yet.

530
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:52,814
[SPEAKER_18]: Not until they put the shovel in the ground.

531
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:54,614
[SPEAKER_18]: So it'll be next year.

532
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:57,335
[SPEAKER_09]: Next year, yeah.

533
00:40:57,475 --> 00:40:59,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other large developments?

534
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:06,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, there's Middlesex Avenue, the apartment complex behind Wendy's, they're in the ground on that one.

535
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:13,584
[SPEAKER_18]: Is Rivers Edge going to put another apartment building on the front parcel there?

536
00:41:14,024 --> 00:41:14,625
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it two now?

537
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:15,886
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it two?

538
00:41:16,486 --> 00:41:16,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

539
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:23,450
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's a lot of activity in the apartment sector of real estate, not just in Medford, but all over.

540
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:29,754
[SPEAKER_18]: Rents have gone up, especially in those higher end apartment complexes.

541
00:41:31,436 --> 00:41:32,616
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

542
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:40,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Also on Locust Street, Lumineer, they should be coming on board too.

543
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,891
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the one we were just talking about, yeah.

544
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:46,433
[SPEAKER_18]: Locust and Middlesex, 3780 Mystic Valley Parkway.

545
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:46,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

546
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:47,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

547
00:41:47,554 --> 00:42:00,241
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get Lumineer, and then you're going to have the one at opposite station, standing where Mellon Bank is, and then you're going to have one further down in front of where the medical building is, and then, where's the fourth one?

548
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:03,423
[SPEAKER_03]: River's Edge, Middlesex Ave.

549
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,363
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's what I'm talking about.

550
00:42:04,423 --> 00:42:05,144
[SPEAKER_03]: River's Edge will have

551
00:42:06,285 --> 00:42:06,685
[SPEAKER_03]: River's edge.

552
00:42:06,705 --> 00:42:07,306
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have one.

553
00:42:07,346 --> 00:42:14,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the front in front of where Mellon bank is on the baseball field, there's another 230 units going to be in the back at one cab at road, right?

554
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:19,051
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can have two 30, three 30, four, you can have almost 550 more new units.

555
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:20,251
[SPEAKER_03]: More than that.

556
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:21,872
[SPEAKER_18]: When they come online, right.

557
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:25,014
[SPEAKER_18]: And higher end rents as well.

558
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:25,494
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

559
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:32,417
[SPEAKER_18]: So there seems to be an incentive to build in Medford proximity location amenities.

560
00:42:33,272 --> 00:42:39,017
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see how long that lasts once the casino goes in, and what that does to the traffic, and to the Wellington area.

561
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:51,267
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I'd just like to get back and, are we gonna stay on that page, or are we going on another?

562
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:52,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

563
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:55,511
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll all wait until we get to the very end.

564
00:42:55,811 --> 00:42:56,992
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be other issues, I don't know.

565
00:42:58,913 --> 00:43:00,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions, motions?

566
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,193
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor DelaRusso.

567
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:07,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion to approve Mr. President.

568
00:43:08,314 --> 00:43:11,316
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a four part process.

569
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:16,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record on the motion of approval by Councilor DelaRusso.

570
00:43:17,901 --> 00:43:20,543
[SPEAKER_06]: If you could step aside and let the gentleman up here please.

571
00:43:23,065 --> 00:43:24,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

572
00:43:25,847 --> 00:43:28,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, my name is John Sorrello.

573
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:31,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I reside at 20 Metcalfe Street, Medford and uh,

574
00:43:33,131 --> 00:43:38,734
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say that the way this is presented here, this is an open hearing.

575
00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:41,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And the people have to have input.

576
00:43:41,476 --> 00:43:43,277
[SPEAKER_02]: And this should be thoroughly debated.

577
00:43:44,557 --> 00:43:54,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what happens here is that this paper put forth by the administration says, historically, the council has chosen a minimum residential factor.

578
00:43:55,503 --> 00:43:59,966
[SPEAKER_02]: If this is, once again, the council choice, the minimum residential factor is almost 90%.

579
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:05,268
[SPEAKER_02]: The administration shouldn't be telling you how to vote on this.

580
00:44:05,788 --> 00:44:08,070
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think you should debate this and then decide.

581
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:15,333
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a whole range of factors here, beginning with the single factor, which is approximately 13 percent.

582
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:18,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yes, it's 13 percent.

583
00:44:19,775 --> 00:44:27,739
[SPEAKER_02]: With the new factor put in, the rate will rise.

584
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:31,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the point I want to make is there is a difference between

585
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,121
[SPEAKER_02]: a rate and a levy.

586
00:44:36,681 --> 00:44:41,884
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the rate may be lower, but the levy is higher.

587
00:44:43,164 --> 00:44:45,266
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should not confuse those two.

588
00:44:46,186 --> 00:45:00,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I want to ask the auditor, if we had had, over the last 28 years, if we had had a single factor, would the tax levy itself

589
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:04,907
[SPEAKER_02]: be higher or lower than it is now?

590
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:08,148
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish one of them would answer that question.

591
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:25,472
[SPEAKER_23]: As we've discussed in the past, the way the formula is constructed, when you do the

592
00:45:26,622 --> 00:45:36,244
[SPEAKER_23]: residential factor shift, to shift the burden of the taxes from the residential payers to the commercial payers, it does result in a higher levy.

593
00:45:37,224 --> 00:45:46,447
[SPEAKER_23]: However, it results in a lower tax bill for the residential owners as opposed to the commercial tax bill.

594
00:45:47,307 --> 00:45:52,608
[SPEAKER_23]: And we went back last year, or the year before, we went back six years and determined that

595
00:45:53,183 --> 00:46:13,165
[SPEAKER_23]: if we had had a single rate every year for those six years, at the end of that six year period, even though the levy was higher, in other words, the amount of taxes brought into the city from all sources, the levy is higher, the residents, not the single family, but the residents, as opposed to the commercial, the residential class,

596
00:46:13,703 --> 00:46:14,824
[SPEAKER_23]: still would pay less.

597
00:46:15,624 --> 00:46:21,067
[SPEAKER_23]: And he's trying to say, if we went back to 1988 and did it every year from 1988, would it still be lower?

598
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:39,115
[SPEAKER_23]: I haven't done that exercise, but I would be willing to bet that because we do a full 175% shift from the residential class to the commercial class, I don't believe that the residential taxpayer would ever recoup what they've saved over the years by having their residential shift.

599
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:42,017
[SPEAKER_23]: And that is what this council has approved every year,

600
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:47,472
[SPEAKER_23]: since 1988, they've approved it every year, because that's true.

601
00:46:48,113 --> 00:46:52,355
[SPEAKER_23]: And we didn't go back to do it until 1988, but we went back six years, and it proved out true then.

602
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:58,218
[SPEAKER_23]: And even in some of the years when the values were down, we were doing a 200% shift.

603
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:00,199
[SPEAKER_23]: We did a 200% shift.

604
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:08,123
[SPEAKER_23]: So I don't believe that the residential taxpayer would ever have recouped the savings that were granted through this shift in all those years.

605
00:47:11,785 --> 00:47:12,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to respond to that.

606
00:47:14,685 --> 00:47:17,087
[SPEAKER_02]: The tax levy last year was $93 million.

607
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:21,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this year it's going to be $96.5 million.

608
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:24,531
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an increase there of $3.5 million.

609
00:47:25,531 --> 00:47:34,596
[SPEAKER_02]: On the other hand, if we had had the single tax rate from the beginning, well, we'd be paying $6 million less.

610
00:47:35,237 --> 00:47:36,737
[SPEAKER_02]: The tax levy now would be $89 million.

611
00:47:42,533 --> 00:47:46,054
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens is really that the people pay the tax levy.

612
00:47:46,975 --> 00:47:48,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's what they are actually paying.

613
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:54,198
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would happen really is that the payments would be less.

614
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:56,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, taxes would still go up.

615
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:57,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't misunderstand.

616
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,221
[SPEAKER_02]: But they would go up much less if we had a single rate.

617
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:03,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, Oregon has a single rate.

618
00:48:04,062 --> 00:48:05,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Belmont has a single rate.

619
00:48:05,702 --> 00:48:06,283
[SPEAKER_02]: They love it.

620
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,763
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're prosperous.

621
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record.

622
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:13,410
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening.

623
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:18,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Ave., Medford, Mass., and I want to thank Dr. Stirella.

624
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,893
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be debate about a city budget.

625
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:26,515
[SPEAKER_04]: It shouldn't just come in here, go through the other, and then be rubber-stamped.

626
00:48:27,275 --> 00:48:32,397
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially, I'm concerned about the $600,000 from the franchise fee.

627
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:35,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the listening, viewing public needs to know

628
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:45,614
[SPEAKER_04]: In most cities and towns, the entire peg money, all 5%, goes to public access television, governmental television in high school.

629
00:48:46,535 --> 00:48:47,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's the high school money?

630
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:51,099
[SPEAKER_04]: 200 grand goes to TV3, the old TV3.

631
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,163
[SPEAKER_04]: 200 grand's supposed to go to the government channel, but it's used for three salaries at the high school.

632
00:48:57,204 --> 00:49:03,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the 600 grand goes into a general fund, which the mayor does this, no one discusses it,

633
00:49:04,886 --> 00:49:09,248
[SPEAKER_04]: And his own community access TV committee said, we need 500 grand to start a new station.

634
00:49:10,388 --> 00:49:16,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet, if he's taken 600K, and we've lost access, that 600K this year should go to building a new station.

635
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:18,631
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a second tier tax.

636
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:20,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the term they use.

637
00:49:20,852 --> 00:49:26,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just call it a second tax on the cable TV subscribers, who already pay the real estate tax.

638
00:49:26,815 --> 00:49:29,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're getting to pay another tax.

639
00:49:29,876 --> 00:49:31,756
[SPEAKER_04]: This is another tax, and it's wrong.

640
00:49:32,077 --> 00:49:32,777
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unfair.

641
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:42,221
[SPEAKER_04]: And this council really needs to do something about it, because year after year after year, the mayor just takes that money, throws it in the general fund, and no one knows where it's coming from.

642
00:49:42,261 --> 00:49:44,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's where it's coming from, your cable TV bill.

643
00:49:46,582 --> 00:49:48,163
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor DelaRusso.

644
00:49:48,183 --> 00:49:48,323
[SPEAKER_06]: May I?

645
00:49:49,343 --> 00:49:49,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sure.

646
00:49:51,204 --> 00:49:52,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, sir.

647
00:49:52,585 --> 00:49:56,546
[SPEAKER_17]: Andrew Castanetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, Mass.

648
00:49:57,807 --> 00:49:59,828
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse my hat, I'm a bit out of the weather.

649
00:50:03,163 --> 00:50:05,564
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll make this very brief, even though I forgot my glasses.

650
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

651
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:22,273
[SPEAKER_17]: First off, season greetings, and if I may, I wish you all a peaceful Christmas.

652
00:50:25,295 --> 00:50:28,536
[SPEAKER_17]: We feel like this is deja vu all over again,

653
00:50:30,936 --> 00:50:47,385
[SPEAKER_17]: will you please give the local owner-occupied homeowner at least a 20% real estate tax exemption, only if they live in their house, which can be verified by their income tax filing address.

654
00:50:49,828 --> 00:51:01,235
[SPEAKER_17]: As you know, this real real estate tax savings is being done in Malden, Everett, Somerville, and it's at 35 percent in Somerville.

655
00:51:02,956 --> 00:51:03,636
[SPEAKER_17]: Why not us?

656
00:51:05,918 --> 00:51:13,002
[SPEAKER_17]: At least give us the 20 percent, which is automatic from the state of Massachusetts, if we adopt it.

657
00:51:15,904 --> 00:51:16,644
[SPEAKER_17]: Especially when

658
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:40,627
[SPEAKER_17]: 12 of 13, over 90% of Medford homeowners would receive a lower real estate tax bill than last year's, versus historically a two to 4% yearly increase in real estate tax bill dollars.

659
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:48,651
[SPEAKER_17]: I, we the people, are not politicians at this time, however,

660
00:51:50,437 --> 00:52:17,462
[SPEAKER_17]: You, our elected city councilors, do have the power tonight to vote for a 20% real estate tax exemption and vote to send this request to Mayor McGlynn because I believe only he, the mayor, has the authority slash option to select and adopt this real estate tax exemption.

661
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:19,509
[SPEAKER_17]: along with U.S.

662
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:20,629
[SPEAKER_17]: City Council approval.

663
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:30,095
[SPEAKER_17]: Under Commonwealth of Massachusetts, General Laws, Chapter 59, Section 5C.

664
00:52:35,259 --> 00:52:40,042
[SPEAKER_17]: We the people, the working class hero, needs real estate tax relief.

665
00:52:42,423 --> 00:52:46,306
[SPEAKER_17]: Please vote yes, help save our middle class neighbors,

666
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:48,307
[SPEAKER_17]: before it's too late.

667
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:58,069
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you kindly for listening and hopefully getting this done for its 10 years overdue.

668
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,810
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks again.

669
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:05,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

670
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to make one more very, very important point.

671
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:14,412
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you think if I asked this city council to assess

672
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:18,812
[SPEAKER_02]: the residents of Medford, a $24 tax rate.

673
00:53:19,652 --> 00:53:21,093
[SPEAKER_02]: It's now $12, right?

674
00:53:21,914 --> 00:53:40,084
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you go for the minimum factor, what you're doing really is putting that $24 tax rate that you think that you're assigning to the CIPs, the commercial, industrial, and personal property taxes, you're putting that on the budget.

675
00:53:41,165 --> 00:53:44,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And who pays 80% of the budget but the residents?

676
00:53:44,246 --> 00:53:45,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here you are.

677
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:54,359
[SPEAKER_02]: charging the residents $24 per 1,000 on that particular category, which is new growth.

678
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the people ought to know that.

679
00:53:58,242 --> 00:54:02,084
[SPEAKER_02]: They are paying a $24 tax rate with this minimum factor.

680
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:09,750
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

681
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Camuso.

682
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:19,741
[SPEAKER_09]: Considering that Councilor Marks isn't present tonight, this is one of the two most important issues this council votes on.

683
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:24,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Not only that, but we have a whole host of information, so another week would not hurt.

684
00:54:25,243 --> 00:54:42,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I also want to get the figures on the free cash for 2011, what was put into free cash, 2011, 2012, 2013, because I will have a motion to reduce the levy by that figure, or an average of that figure.

685
00:54:43,122 --> 00:54:45,267
[SPEAKER_09]: I move to table this matter until next week.

686
00:54:46,169 --> 00:54:49,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion for table has been request, which ends all debate.

687
00:54:51,128 --> 00:54:56,631
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you withdraw it so we can at least read the two resolutions that we're asking for so we can take an official vote on it and then move it right again?

688
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:59,893
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, it's two resolutions we're asking for.

689
00:54:59,933 --> 00:55:09,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Council Lungo Kern, 2011, 2012, and 2013, how much certified free cash was signed off on by the Department of Revenue and certified.

690
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:12,819
[SPEAKER_06]: And by Councilor Penta, 2011, 2012, and 2013, Comcast and Verizon paid to Channel 3.

691
00:55:21,052 --> 00:55:21,772
[SPEAKER_15]: They paid into the city.

692
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:22,993
[SPEAKER_06]: They paid into the city.

693
00:55:23,013 --> 00:55:27,614
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the other one is how much was paid to Channel 3 for fiscal years 2011 and 2012.

694
00:55:27,894 --> 00:55:33,196
[SPEAKER_06]: On those two motions, one further motion.

695
00:55:33,256 --> 00:55:43,019
[SPEAKER_03]: One further correction, I think Councilor Longo's current motion is basically for the years 11, 12, and 13, how much did that represent a surplus in those years of city's budgets?

696
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:43,539
[SPEAKER_03]: All of it.

697
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:44,119
[SPEAKER_03]: The free cash.

698
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:45,179
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why it gets certified.

699
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:49,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I want the actual documents showing how much was certified too.

700
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:50,261
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what you asked for.

701
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:52,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Pinto.

702
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,766
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion, these two resolutions, all those in favor?

703
00:55:55,246 --> 00:55:55,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

704

[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Mr. President.

729
00:57:52,671 --> 00:58:02,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, last week we discussed the cyclical reevaluation process that's in place and um, Assessor O'Neill did have,

730
00:58:03,496 --> 00:58:12,884
[SPEAKER_13]: get back to us and I was hoping that he'd be able to provide the general public with an update as to where we are in the revaluation cycle in terms of the DOI mandated process that needs to take place.

731
00:58:15,486 --> 00:58:20,050
[SPEAKER_18]: For you, Mr. President, that was Council Resolve 14770.

732
00:58:22,842 --> 00:58:35,647
[SPEAKER_18]: The real property inspect re-inspection program is nearing the year of end one as of October 6,279 residential and 545 commercial industrial exempt exterior inspections have been completed.

733
00:58:36,788 --> 00:58:42,870
[SPEAKER_18]: We are in the process of putting a letter together to mail out to the people that have not had the interior inspection.

734
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:46,191
[SPEAKER_18]: The owner can schedule this with the appraisal vendor directly.

735
00:58:47,652 --> 00:58:47,752
[SPEAKER_18]: Um,

736
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:50,874

738
00:58:53,696 --> 00:59:08,908
[SPEAKER_18]: Before you is a overlay reserve transfer to overlay surplus to fund year two and also to fund, I believe it was about eight or nine appellate tax board case to be able to defend those.

739
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:15,653
[SPEAKER_18]: The estimated number of outstanding inspections is about 7,160 residential and about 775 commercial industrial exempt.

740
00:59:22,345 --> 00:59:27,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Mr O'Neill, thank you very much for getting back to the council in such a timely fashion.

00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:39,878
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, in terms of the appellate tax book cases that are out there, pending is, uh, those cases handled internally or as outside council hired, uh, uh, the board of assessors, uh, tries to handle and negotiate those internally.

742
00:59:39,898 --> 00:59:47,504
[SPEAKER_18]: And sometimes, uh, when a push comes to shove, we need expert assistance, uh, whether it be an appraiser or an attorney.

743
00:59:48,323 --> 00:59:50,424
[SPEAKER_18]: that deals with those cases on a daily basis.

744
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,345
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a case-by-case?

745
00:59:51,525 --> 00:59:52,206
[SPEAKER_18]: Case-by-case.

746
00:59:52,386 --> 00:59:52,666

792
01:03:02,457 --> 01:03:03,057
[SPEAKER_06]: in favor.

793
01:03:03,937 --> 01:03:05,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record.

794
01:03:06,538 --> 01:03:08,018
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm Mary Ellen Murphy.

795
01:03:08,198 --> 01:03:11,759
[SPEAKER_21]: I work for National Grid, 170 Medford Street, Malden.

796
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:20,801
[SPEAKER_21]: And what happened here was that there was already a poll line existing that fed the American Legion.

797
01:03:22,442 --> 01:03:26,363
[SPEAKER_21]: Unfortunately, it goes across the

798
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:34,979
[SPEAKER_21]: property next door which that owner has decided to divide up into three sections and build some housing there.

799
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:53,092
[SPEAKER_21]: So what we're going to do is we already have an easement that the American Legion has agreed to, not signed yet, of putting a pole on their property and then this pole that's going in between the other two

800
01:03:54,479 --> 01:03:56,441
[SPEAKER_21]: is going to feed that pole on their property.

801
01:03:56,481 --> 01:04:00,384
[SPEAKER_21]: So everything will be taken off the property at 333 Winthrop Street.

802
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:04,427
[SPEAKER_21]: And that's all overhead.

803
01:04:04,447 --> 01:04:12,093
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not sure why it says underground, but I guess that would include putting the pole in the ground.

804
01:04:12,213 --> 01:04:14,935
[SPEAKER_21]: And we're going to put transformers on that pole.

805
01:04:16,516 --> 01:04:19,719
[SPEAKER_21]: All the utilities will come off that pole that feeds the American Legion.

806
01:04:21,712 --> 01:04:26,294
[SPEAKER_21]: Like I said, we already have an easement started, which is not signed yet.

807
01:04:28,555 --> 01:04:28,856
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

808
01:04:28,896 --> 01:04:29,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

809
01:04:29,876 --> 01:04:31,317
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone in favor?

810
01:04:32,277 --> 01:04:32,778
[SPEAKER_06]: In favor?

811
01:04:32,838 --> 01:04:39,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing and hearing no one else, I now close that portion of the public hearing and open it up to anyone in opposition.

812
01:04:40,762 --> 01:04:41,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone in opposition?

813
01:04:43,523 --> 01:04:51,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Seeing and hearing none, I now close that portion of the public hearing and call upon Vice President Caraviello, Chairperson of Licensing.

814
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:52,744
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

815
01:04:52,924 --> 01:04:57,707
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, I reviewed the papers and they appear to be in order and a motion for approval on the motion for approval.

816
01:04:57,767 --> 01:05:00,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Knight and then counselor Della Russo.

817
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:01,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

818
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:02,730
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, Ms.

819
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:09,314
[SPEAKER_13]: Murphy, if I can ask a couple of questions, um, if approved, do you know when the work will start?

820
01:05:09,394 --> 01:05:10,235
[SPEAKER_13]: How long after approval?

821
01:05:10,915 --> 01:05:14,578
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, well, like I said, we have to get the easement first.

822
01:05:17,518 --> 01:05:21,681
[SPEAKER_21]: That should be shortly, because I think we applied for that back in October.

823
01:05:23,062 --> 01:05:27,925
[SPEAKER_21]: And once that's signed, we can probably start.

824
01:05:28,845 --> 01:05:31,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Once construction starts, do you know how long this project is going to take?

825
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:36,450
[SPEAKER_21]: A day or two, I think.

826
01:05:39,932 --> 01:05:43,675
[SPEAKER_13]: And do you anticipate this project being done in the winter months or in the spring months?

827
01:05:44,967 --> 01:05:47,348
[SPEAKER_21]: Probably next, this month or next month.

828
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:53,632
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that Councilor?

829
01:05:57,293 --> 01:05:58,574
[SPEAKER_16]: I am, Mr. President.

830
01:05:58,594 --> 01:05:58,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

831
01:05:59,014 --> 01:06:00,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor DelaRusso, then Councilor Penta.

832
01:06:01,516 --> 01:06:13,582
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could just, Mr. President, mention that I saw in some of the items under suspension that we have coming up, there was concern about a utility

833
01:06:14,352 --> 01:06:22,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, I think it was a resolution by Councilor Knight, uh, by one of the utilities, uh, not returning things back to their proper order.

834
01:06:23,137 --> 01:06:42,147
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to, uh, take this opportunity to remind the representative of National Grid, uh, with all due kindness, but firmly, uh, to remind them that, uh, they are obliged to return, um, uh, any, uh, of the roadways, sidewalks, and, and abutting areas to their, uh,

835
01:06:43,126 --> 01:06:58,539
[SPEAKER_16]: natural pristine state after the work is done so that the traffic and pedestrians and especially those with disabilities are unimpeded after that work.

836
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:00,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

837
01:07:01,162 --> 01:07:02,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Henton.

838
01:07:02,883 --> 01:07:03,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Two points.

839
01:07:03,564 --> 01:07:06,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is your first time here?

840
01:07:06,046 --> 01:07:08,328
[SPEAKER_06]: You've been here.

841
01:07:08,748 --> 01:07:09,409
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been here before?

842
01:07:09,429 --> 01:07:09,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

843
01:07:09,989 --> 01:07:10,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, okay.

844
01:07:11,775 --> 01:07:16,059
[SPEAKER_03]: This council voted well over a year ago, and then again during this past summer on Terrace Road.

845
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:18,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Two light poles came down.

846
01:07:20,082 --> 01:07:26,808
[SPEAKER_03]: And when National Grid went there, whoever they hired for contractor, what they did is they filled the holes and they never put the poles back up with the lights.

847
01:07:27,428 --> 01:07:28,849
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a serious public safety issue.

848
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:32,733
[SPEAKER_03]: The council's on record on two separate times in voting for that.

849
01:07:33,734 --> 01:07:36,856
[SPEAKER_03]: National Grid went up there, they marked the street, but they never put the poles back.

850
01:07:38,177 --> 01:07:39,198
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, where is this?

851
01:07:39,218 --> 01:07:39,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrace Road.

852
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:51,023
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of, oh, okay, I'm sorry.

853
01:07:52,544 --> 01:07:59,307
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been brought to whoever runs the show over there in Malden numerous times, and they keep saying we're gonna get to it, and nobody's gotten to it.

854
01:08:00,067 --> 01:08:11,052
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many folks that walk their children up and down the street in baby carriages and what have you, and that gets pretty dark at nighttime.

855
01:08:11,393 --> 01:08:11,993
[SPEAKER_21]: Two poles.

856
01:08:13,092 --> 01:08:13,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Two poles.

857
01:08:13,712 --> 01:08:14,373
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll look into it.

858
01:08:14,513 --> 01:08:15,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Terrace Road.

859
01:08:16,334 --> 01:08:23,319
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, do you have any control over this 36% increase in the electric rate to bring back to your bosses?

860
01:08:23,339 --> 01:08:24,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I did.

861
01:08:24,139 --> 01:08:25,340
[SPEAKER_03]: You got million dollar bonuses?

862
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,541
[SPEAKER_21]: I wish I did.

863
01:08:27,902 --> 01:08:29,063
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a shame, because you know.

864
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:33,285
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I live in the national grid territory, too, and my rates are going to go up.

865
01:08:34,286 --> 01:08:35,767
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really unfair, you know?

866
01:08:36,427 --> 01:08:38,329
[SPEAKER_03]: One year, I mean, you people are conglomerate.

867
01:08:38,349 --> 01:08:39,429
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got gas and electric.

868
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:41,771
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, we have no control over anything.

869
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:44,991
[SPEAKER_03]: And the poor ratepayers are going to pay another 27% to 36%.

870
01:08:45,852 --> 01:08:51,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And as the story goes, and as it's been advertised, all your bonuses of a million dollars plus went to your higher executives.

871
01:08:51,314 --> 01:08:53,015
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how they can justify that.

872
01:08:53,075 --> 01:08:53,655
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just wrong.

873
01:08:54,435 --> 01:09:01,859
[SPEAKER_21]: I think they're justifying it by saying that the increase in fuel costs, but I'm not sure that.

874
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:04,300
[SPEAKER_06]: You're the engineer, right?

875
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:04,880
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

876
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:05,820
[SPEAKER_06]: From National Grid?

877
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

878
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,822
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to send a separate resolution to the corporate office?

879
01:09:09,182 --> 01:09:09,742
[SPEAKER_06]: You could do that.

880
01:09:10,652 --> 01:09:14,875
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Penta to send a resolution inquiring why the rates went up.

881
01:09:15,576 --> 01:09:16,136
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

882
01:09:16,156 --> 01:09:16,396
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

883
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:17,497
[SPEAKER_03]: We know the rates went up.

884
01:09:17,617 --> 01:09:17,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

885
01:09:17,937 --> 01:09:24,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think, I think if they're going to have the rates, I just think it's unfair that they would take million dollar bonuses in their contracts.

886
01:09:24,942 --> 01:09:25,262
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

887
01:09:25,382 --> 01:09:25,963
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll send that.

888
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:29,125
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Penta, all those in favor?

889
01:09:29,485 --> 01:09:29,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

890
01:09:29,906 --> 01:09:30,566
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

891
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:31,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

892
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:33,900
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

893
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,561
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want to take the opportunity to thank Ms.

894
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:43,326
[SPEAKER_13]: Murphy, because last time she appeared before the Council, I raised some concerns that I had relative to a sidewalk and a street repair between Smith Ave.

895
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:47,769
[SPEAKER_13]: and Hicks Ave., which is the subject of a resolution that I'm going to be bringing up this evening under suspension.

896
01:09:48,489 --> 01:09:49,430
[SPEAKER_13]: And although Ms.

897
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:56,714
[SPEAKER_13]: Murphy works, from what I can tell, in the distribution of electricity, within a week, they were out there and they had fixed the street from Hicks Ave.

898
01:09:56,754 --> 01:09:57,295
[SPEAKER_13]: to Smith Ave.

899
01:09:57,315 --> 01:09:59,656
[SPEAKER_13]: and repaired it into its natural and pristine condition.

900
01:09:59,716 --> 01:10:00,797
[SPEAKER_13]: So, Ms.

901
01:10:00,837 --> 01:10:02,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Murphy, I want to thank you for your efforts on that.

902
01:10:02,935 --> 01:10:07,940
[SPEAKER_11]: because it was two days later that I drove down the street and I saw the sawhorses out there and they were ready to get to work.

903
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,361
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much for your efforts.

904
01:10:09,461 --> 01:10:17,488
[SPEAKER_11]: And I trust that if you were able to do something with the 37% increase in the electrical bill, in the two or three days from now, we'd probably see it taken care of.

905
01:10:17,508 --> 01:10:19,771
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you very much for your past work on behalf of this council.

906
01:10:20,912 --> 01:10:21,192
Thank you.

907
01:10:22,033 --> 01:10:23,234
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of the vice president.

908
01:10:24,755 --> 01:10:25,456
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

909
01:10:25,816 --> 01:10:25,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

910
01:10:26,216 --> 01:10:26,877
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

911
01:10:26,897 --> 01:10:26,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

912
01:10:27,558 --> 01:10:28,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Ayes have it.

913
01:10:28,118 --> 01:10:28,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

914
01:10:33,686 --> 01:10:36,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And on the motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

915
01:10:36,114 --> 01:10:36,797
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favour?

916
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,577
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed, the ayes have it.

917
01:10:39,717 --> 01:10:43,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Item 14-774, offered by Councilor Knight.

918
01:10:43,938 --> 01:10:55,283
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the MBTA take the proper steps to ensure that the route 96 bus makes all scheduled stops persuadent to the established and publicized bus stop locations.

919
01:10:55,863 --> 01:11:02,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved that the MBTA give specific attention to the stop located at Medford Square and City Hall parking lot.

920
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:05,327
[SPEAKER_06]: As recent reports allege that the weekdays

921
01:11:06,311 --> 01:11:06,612
[SPEAKER_06]: 6 a.m.

922
01:11:06,672 --> 01:11:07,813
[SPEAKER_06]: and Saturday 6 a.m.

923
01:11:07,873 --> 01:11:11,536
[SPEAKER_06]: bus frequently bypass this established and publicized location.

924
01:11:11,997 --> 01:11:12,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

925
01:11:13,779 --> 01:11:15,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

926
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:28,273
[SPEAKER_13]: I was recently contacted by a number of members of the laborers union who are working on a project in Harvard square and they reside in Medford and they walk down to Medford square city hall and they get on the bus to take that bus to Harvard square.

927
01:11:29,262 --> 01:11:31,864
[SPEAKER_13]: because parking is such a hassle over there.

928
01:11:32,484 --> 01:11:37,206
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's been brought to my attention that usually on Thursdays and Saturdays, the 6 a.m.

929
01:11:37,266 --> 01:11:46,912
[SPEAKER_13]: bus fails to make a stop at the City Hall stop, Mr. President, resulting in these individuals being late for work or having to take taxis to work.

930
01:11:47,632 --> 01:11:51,074
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the reason that this happens is because of the way the route's structured.

931
01:11:51,094 --> 01:11:57,197
[SPEAKER_13]: It has to go past, you know, the old Tony Lucci's, take a left down river, come back past City Hall Plaza, and then do the loop again.

932
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:03,912
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe in the interest of time, some of these drivers are bypassing a certain stop that may or may not be busy all the time.

933
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:07,435
[SPEAKER_13]: However, it's had an impact on these hardworking individuals.

934
01:12:07,475 --> 01:12:17,323
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like a letter to be sent out to the MVTA to be sure that their drivers are made aware of the fact that that is a stop and that that's a stop that means a lot to the residents here in the city of Medford.

935
01:12:17,703 --> 01:12:18,784
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a publicized stop.

936
01:12:18,824 --> 01:12:19,505
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on their schedule.

937
01:12:19,525 --> 01:12:20,145
[SPEAKER_13]: It's on their route.

938
01:12:20,165 --> 01:12:21,526
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's a stop that they should be making.

939
01:12:22,747 --> 01:12:23,448
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

940
01:12:23,728 --> 01:12:25,149
[SPEAKER_20]: When I sit down, I wanted to add something to that.

941
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:26,050
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

942
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:31,178
[SPEAKER_06]: The chair recognizes Vice President Cara Villalo.

943
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:35,499
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

944
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:50,302
[SPEAKER_20]: While we're talking about that same route, on Riverside Avenue, right in front of the doctor's office with the benches, I don't know if any of you have driven by there, but the street has kind of been raised up by all the buses that go by there on Salem Street.

945
01:12:50,722 --> 01:12:54,483
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if that's our responsibility to fix that, but the T's,

946
01:12:57,258 --> 01:13:07,341
[SPEAKER_20]: As I say, if you drive by there, right at the stop, you'll see a huge lift in the road from the buses that always stop right directly across from River Street.

947
01:13:08,702 --> 01:13:09,762
[SPEAKER_20]: And to the DPW?

948
01:13:10,582 --> 01:13:17,884
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know who's responsible for fixing that, but it's directly right at the bus stop in front of the little power plant and right there.

949
01:13:18,345 --> 01:13:22,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the motion to send that to the MBTA, all those in favor?

950
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:27,332
[SPEAKER_09]: because you said Salem Street and Riverside Ave.

951
01:13:27,692 --> 01:13:35,558
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right, right on Salem Street, right where the power station is, there's the bench there on the station.

952
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:36,979
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, so on Salem Street.

953
01:13:36,999 --> 01:13:38,080
[SPEAKER_20]: It's actually on Salem Street.

954
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:40,182
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

955
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:41,503
[SPEAKER_20]: Directly across from River Street.

956
01:13:41,803 --> 01:13:42,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Directly across, okay.

957
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:49,389
[SPEAKER_20]: Right there, you see there's a huge, it's probably up in the air, probably about seven or eight inches from all the buses pulling in there.

958
01:13:50,362 --> 01:14:04,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay On the motion of on the motion of council a night and amended by vice president care of yellow all those in favor Guys have it

959
01:14:06,069 --> 01:14:20,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Item 14-775, petition for a reversal of a sign denial by Bowler Engineering for Wendy's, 330 Middlesex Avenue, Medford Mass, OCD application 2014A, excessive number of primary signs.

960
01:14:21,222 --> 01:14:25,406
[SPEAKER_06]: In 2014B, excessive number of primary signs.

961
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:27,968
[SPEAKER_06]: 2014C, excessive number of primary signs.

962
01:14:30,771 --> 01:14:31,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record.

963
01:14:32,897 --> 01:14:34,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, thank you, uh, Mr. President.

964
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:46,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, my name's Anthony Donato with Bowler engineering and, um, so we'd like to present this appeal, um, to this, to the counselors.

965
01:14:46,336 --> 01:14:48,960
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we have this proposed restaurant.

966
01:15:01,764 --> 01:15:06,528
[SPEAKER_08]: In the audience with us tonight, we have Mr. Chad Adams, who works for Wendy's.

967
01:15:06,588 --> 01:15:15,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd just like to present to you the proposed renderings of the new restaurant.

968
01:15:16,217 --> 01:15:22,622
[SPEAKER_08]: And it depicts the signs on three sides, which is similar to other fast food establishments in the area.

969
01:15:23,043 --> 01:15:24,944
[SPEAKER_08]: It's located in the industrial area.

970
01:15:25,585 --> 01:15:27,667
[SPEAKER_08]: And currently, the building is set back about

971
01:15:28,703 --> 01:15:31,926
[SPEAKER_08]: 30 feet further than adjacent buildings on either side of the property.

972
01:15:32,266 --> 01:15:36,109
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is a six foot chain link fence on the property.

973
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:46,616
[SPEAKER_08]: So to maintain competitiveness with other fast food restaurants in the area, we are proposing to present this, uh, these, um, this signage on this proposed building.

974
01:15:46,637 --> 01:15:51,060
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have any questions with regards to the renderings.

975
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Chair recognizes Councilor DelaRusso who has the papers.

976
01:15:56,307 --> 01:16:09,972
[SPEAKER_16]: If I could, Mr. President, this falls under the Business and Economics Development and Signs Committee, chaired by Councilor Marks, who's absent this evening for a personal emergency.

977
01:16:11,293 --> 01:16:22,457
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could just explain, the restaurant's undergoing a renovation, and this sign brings it up to the franchise standard or the corporate standard of advertisement.

978
01:16:23,965 --> 01:16:26,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, if I might, my name's Chad Adams.

979
01:16:26,286 --> 01:16:29,067
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the regional construction manager for Wendy's.

980
01:16:29,787 --> 01:16:38,169
[SPEAKER_07]: The address is 40 General Warren Boulevard, Suite 260, Melbourne, Pennsylvania.

981
01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:45,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Wendy's is currently undergoing a major rebranding of its image to bring it up to the market.

982
01:16:47,853 --> 01:17:07,689
[SPEAKER_07]: more in line with contemporary standards and what the public is looking for in terms of not only interior modifications, Wi-Fi, more digital type of menus and formatting on the inside, but also on the outside to kind of give it a new look.

983
01:17:07,749 --> 01:17:12,853
[SPEAKER_07]: You're moving into the new millennium and to get it away from the old-fashioned hamburgers to the

984
01:17:13,547 --> 01:17:22,030
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, with the current product offering, which is more than just hamburgers, it's salads, it's chicken, it's a wide variety of different products.

985
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:30,052
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're kind of dropping the hamburger aspect off of our main tagline and just coming up with just Wendy's.

986
01:17:30,852 --> 01:17:37,014
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is what the, this is what the image is that we're moving actively across the country.

987
01:17:37,574 --> 01:17:39,515
[SPEAKER_07]: And the signage, re-signage is,

988
01:17:40,294 --> 01:18:01,379
[SPEAKER_07]: is part of that, where you have the old Wendy's sign that's more of a, really like an 1890s type font that you might see in old time days, stuff to a more contemporary script, still maintaining the company logo image of the Wendy's.

989
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:02,640
[SPEAKER_16]: A little Wendy.

990
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:03,440
[SPEAKER_07]: A little Wendy.

991
01:18:04,807 --> 01:18:20,439
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is, and the way we're trying to set it up, it's not necessarily more is better, but strategically placing the signage where it gets the biggest bang for the buck.

992
01:18:20,459 --> 01:18:22,841
[SPEAKER_07]: The average sign is, I think it's 32 square feet.

993
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:33,102
[SPEAKER_07]: including the cameo, and we've placed it strategically on the front blade element, which is this element here.

994
01:18:33,762 --> 01:18:40,003
[SPEAKER_07]: We have another accent element in the drive-thru window, or the other side of the building.

995
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:54,226
[SPEAKER_07]: And then on the non-drive-thru side, or the main vestibule, we have just the accent that kind of delineates, helps delineate the entry point into the building on the non-drive-thru side.

996
01:18:55,185 --> 01:18:58,206
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the basic signage elements.

997
01:18:58,226 --> 01:19:03,787
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, there are some other non-illuminated signs that we're requesting as well.

998
01:19:04,347 --> 01:19:12,789
[SPEAKER_07]: They're more, I would call them, classify them more as like artwork, in that they don't say Wendy's, they don't convey the product.

999
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:15,350
[SPEAKER_07]: They're basically trying to convey

1000
01:19:17,275 --> 01:19:22,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Quality so quality is our Difficulty

1001
01:19:38,867 --> 01:19:41,929
[SPEAKER_07]: service that doesn't have corners is our recipe.

1002
01:19:42,469 --> 01:19:51,034
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, the only people that can see that are people that are in the drive-thru lane, because it's protected by the two outcrops there.

1003
01:19:51,514 --> 01:19:56,357
[SPEAKER_07]: And the last sign is just basically one that says, thank you, then we hang off there.

1004
01:19:56,397 --> 01:20:03,581
[SPEAKER_07]: It's two square feet, mainly just informational, and really serves no purpose other than that.

1005
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:07,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of the package that people are, you know,

1006
01:20:08,987 --> 01:20:15,296
[SPEAKER_07]: pick up your order, you see the thank you, and you get a thank you from the service rep at the window.

1007
01:20:16,337 --> 01:20:17,098
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

1008
01:20:17,138 --> 01:20:23,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, because of the location of this restaurant and that it's not

1009
01:20:24,933 --> 01:20:33,879
[SPEAKER_16]: In a dense residential area, it's a standalone store that's removed, drawn back from the main avenue there quite a bit.

1010
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:40,323
[SPEAKER_16]: I see no problem with allowing these requests, so I move approval.

1011
01:20:40,883 --> 01:20:42,885
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of approval, Council Member Kern.

1012
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Camuso.

1013
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:50,169
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like there's 10 specific requests, and that does include your exit and enter signs.

1014
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:51,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you just

1015
01:20:52,275 --> 01:20:58,877
[SPEAKER_09]: describe to us or explain which the illumination portion of signs that possibly will be illuminated?

1016
01:20:59,197 --> 01:20:59,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1017
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:09,400
[SPEAKER_07]: With respect to the exit and entry said directional signs and the main, you know, pylon sign, the only changes we're doing is the faces.

1018
01:21:09,521 --> 01:21:11,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So the script matches the building.

1019
01:21:12,081 --> 01:21:14,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Those will be illuminated internally.

1020
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:16,663
[SPEAKER_07]: The Wendy's signs, the Wendy's,

1021
01:21:21,803 --> 01:21:24,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Those will be internally illuminated as well.

1022
01:21:24,986 --> 01:21:25,586
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

1023
01:21:25,706 --> 01:21:39,318
[SPEAKER_07]: The other signs, the sign that's in the little cubby here, and the thank you sign, and then this quality of the recipe sign that's over the entry, those are not illuminated.

1024
01:21:39,338 --> 01:21:42,681
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have about, so six out of 10 are illuminated?

1025
01:21:43,882 --> 01:21:44,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1026
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:48,126
[SPEAKER_09]: And what hours do you plan on illuminating them?

1027
01:21:48,472 --> 01:21:52,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, we would illuminate them during the hours of operation.

1028
01:21:52,994 --> 01:21:59,138
[SPEAKER_07]: And right now, I believe we have permission to operate till 1 o'clock in the morning.

1029
01:22:01,819 --> 01:22:07,542
[SPEAKER_09]: By ordinance, does the illumination have to cease at 11 or 10?

1030
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:11,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it ceases at 1 hour after it closes.

1031
01:22:11,264 --> 01:22:13,966
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I said.

1032
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:26,282
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the signs go off when you close, but the light lot can remain illuminated for one hour for safety purposes, allow the workers to get to their cars.

1033
01:22:26,803 --> 01:22:30,804
[SPEAKER_09]: So right now the current signs are illuminated until one o'clock?

1034
01:22:31,144 --> 01:22:31,644
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.

1035
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:35,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and you've got no complaints about that from residents?

1036
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:36,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Not that I'm aware of.

1037
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:43,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and we were told tonight there was a development going behind Wendy's, which is gonna be apartments.

1038
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:48,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Will any of these signs be facing the exterior of your building?

1039
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:56,405
[SPEAKER_07]: None of them will be facing the rear of the building, which is where that development's going to take place.

1040
01:22:56,425 --> 01:22:58,926
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1041
01:23:03,408 --> 01:23:04,789
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, yeah, that's it.

1042
01:23:04,829 --> 01:23:06,429
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it, Councilor?

1043
01:23:06,469 --> 01:23:06,769
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1044
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:08,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one quick question.

1045
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:09,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Penta.

1046
01:23:09,591 --> 01:23:11,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor, Alango brings up a good point.

1047
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:14,633
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though you're open, would you say to 1 o'clock?

1048
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:15,555
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.

1049
01:23:17,176 --> 01:23:29,305
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a situation on the parkway at Stations Landing, and because Kelly's Roast Beef is opposite the residential homes over there, she's right, they have to shut their sign down at 11 o'clock.

1050
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:32,808
[SPEAKER_03]: That's their big sign, not the sign that's on the building.

1051
01:23:33,328 --> 01:23:38,212
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm assuming that Wendy sign right there on the red brick facade, that's your biggest sign?

1052
01:23:40,535 --> 01:23:42,217
[SPEAKER_03]: No, on the facade, the red.

1053
01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:33,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor DelaRusso.

1054
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:34,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Are the present signs illuminated?

1055
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:36,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1056
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:40,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1057
01:24:40,227 --> 01:24:43,910
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as those signs aren't facing the residential homes, correct?

1058
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:47,013
[SPEAKER_07]: No, they're not.

1059
01:24:47,553 --> 01:24:47,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1060
01:24:47,934 --> 01:24:50,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Which residential homes?

1061
01:24:50,516 --> 01:24:50,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Apartments.

1062
01:24:55,884 --> 01:25:01,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you just one more question about your pylon sign that's That is gonna be changed by hand.

1063
01:25:01,588 --> 01:25:03,489
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not gonna be a rotating sign.

1064
01:25:03,509 --> 01:25:05,211
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's my hand.

1065
01:25:06,612 --> 01:25:06,892
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay?

1066
01:25:06,952 --> 01:25:08,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Unless you want to see a digital one.

1067
01:25:08,453 --> 01:25:17,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope second the approval The way it is on the motion of the council of Dela Rousseau seconded by council Lungo Kern all those in favor All those opposed the ayes have it

1068
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:23,001
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Vice President Caraviello to take the papers in the hands of the clerk under suspension.

1069
01:25:23,141 --> 01:25:23,861
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1070
01:25:24,881 --> 01:25:25,641
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1071
01:25:27,182 --> 01:25:28,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Councilor Knight.

1072
01:25:28,682 --> 01:25:37,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved the Office of Disability looked into the National Grid sidewalk repairs between Smith Ave and Hicks Ave to ensure ADA compliance.

1073
01:25:37,564 --> 01:25:42,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved the findings of the Office of Disability to the council and the school department.

1074
01:25:42,284 --> 01:25:43,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1075
01:25:43,545 --> 01:25:44,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1076
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:55,212
[SPEAKER_13]: As I alluded to earlier in the meeting, National Grid is doing some gas line repairs along the stretch of Main Street between Smith Ave and Hicks Ave.

1077
01:25:55,992 --> 01:26:00,934
[SPEAKER_13]: And over the last couple of days, they've ripped up several sidewalk slabs.

1078
01:26:01,254 --> 01:26:06,115
[SPEAKER_13]: However, they've ripped up sidewalk slabs on either side of the street from Smith down to Hicks.

1079
01:26:06,735 --> 01:26:12,020
[SPEAKER_13]: which would make it very difficult for a person in a wheelchair, a person with a cane, to walk down the street, Mr. President.

1080
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:20,327
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, whereas Hicks Ave is the entrance to the Columbus School, I feel as though this may pose a risk to the students that are looking to walk to school, Mr. President.

1081
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:28,794
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm asking that our office of disability take a look and make sure that the project specifications meet ADA compliance for an accessible pathway for individuals.

1082
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:31,119
[SPEAKER_13]: who might have to traverse that road, Mr. President.

1083
01:26:31,559 --> 01:26:39,401
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd also ask that her findings be reported to the school department to ensure that Mr. Belson's well aware of this safety situation down there.

1084
01:26:39,742 --> 01:26:45,744
[SPEAKER_13]: I would leave it to the Office of Disability to determine whether or not they feel as though a police detail is going to be needed down there during the construction project.

1085
01:26:46,364 --> 01:26:51,486
[SPEAKER_13]: At this point in time, I don't have any inkling of understanding as to how long this project's gonna take.

1086
01:26:51,826 --> 01:26:58,328
[SPEAKER_13]: I do know that I personally saw at least 12 sidewalk slabs on either side of the street torn up, so I don't think this is a one-day project.

1087
01:26:58,715 --> 01:27:06,219
[SPEAKER_13]: And based upon the weather that we're going to receive and have been receiving, I don't think this is going to be something that's going to be done in a fashion that's going to be suitable for a longterm solution.

1088
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:08,420
[SPEAKER_13]: If in fact they do get out there to plug these holes.

1089
01:27:08,941 --> 01:27:19,126
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I'm asking that, um, miss McLeod and our office of disability take a look and, uh, make sure that, you know, the, the contractor out there is in compliance with the federal law on the motion.

1090
01:27:19,327 --> 01:27:23,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, have the office of disability report back to the council and the school department.

1091
01:27:24,249 --> 01:27:27,131
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor, all those opposed, the ayes have it.

1092
01:27:27,561 --> 01:27:28,522
[SPEAKER_06]: offered by Councilor Knight.

1093
01:27:29,063 --> 01:27:39,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Medford High School standout girls soccer player, Corey O'Rourke, on being named Boston Herald All-Scholastic and GBL MVP.

1094
01:27:39,638 --> 01:27:44,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved, Corey O'Rourke be invited to appear before the Medford City Council to accept council commendation.

1095
01:27:46,438 --> 01:27:47,959
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of approval, Counselor Knight.

1096
01:27:48,539 --> 01:27:49,959
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1097
01:27:50,019 --> 01:27:54,061
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that, uh, this fine scholar athletes accolades speak for themselves.

1098
01:27:54,281 --> 01:27:57,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, she was the MVP of the greater Boston league this year.

1099
01:27:57,943 --> 01:28:03,405
[SPEAKER_13]: She led her team to the GBL championship title for the girls soccer team here at Medford high school.

1100
01:28:03,465 --> 01:28:08,667
[SPEAKER_13]: And she was also, um, asking Boston Herald Oskalastic, which is one of the highest accolades that, uh,

1101
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:10,711
[SPEAKER_13]: a high school athlete can achieve.

1102
01:28:11,131 --> 01:28:21,156
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that she joins the ranks of some other great Medford athletes like Sean Bates, Jake Perrazzo, and Brittany Lanzilli to be named Boston Herald All Scholastic.

1103
01:28:21,176 --> 01:28:30,421
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it would be fitting to invite her down here to receive a council accommodation and to offer her our congratulations on her great effort and great representation of the student athletes in Medford High School.

1104
01:28:30,441 --> 01:28:30,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

1105
01:28:31,241 --> 01:28:32,982
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1106
01:28:33,752 --> 01:28:34,913
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed, the ayes have it.

1107
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:37,194
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Camuso.

1108
01:28:37,255 --> 01:28:45,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the GBL Championship Team, Medford High School Girls Volleyball Team on their successful season.

1109
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:50,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved the team be invited to appear before the Medford City Council to accept council commendation.

1110
01:28:51,084 --> 01:28:51,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1111
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:53,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1112
01:28:53,731 --> 01:29:00,693
[SPEAKER_13]: This falls in line with what we did over the spring when we had the rowing team up here who was GBL champions for both the boys and the girls teams.

1113
01:29:01,234 --> 01:29:09,357
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it's nice to see our scholar athletes being so successful on the field and in the classroom, and I think it's only fitting that we bring them down here and recognize their achievement.

1114
01:29:10,503 --> 01:29:12,024
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

1115
01:29:12,044 --> 01:29:13,185
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

01:29:13,205 --> 01:29:13,685
[SPEAKER_06]: The ayes have it.

1117
01:29:14,406 --> 01:29:22,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Camuso, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the GBL Champion MHS Girls Soccer Team on their successful season.

1118
01:29:23,112 --> 01:29:28,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it further resolved, the team be invited to appear before the Medford City Council to accept City Council commendations.

1119
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:29,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Knight.

1120
01:29:29,996 --> 01:29:34,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, Mr. President, as I just stated before, I think it's great to see such success on the field and also in the classroom.

1121
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:39,603
[SPEAKER_13]: These student athletes are a great representation of the city of Medford and our public school system.

1122
01:29:39,953 --> 01:29:42,754
[SPEAKER_13]: and I think that it would be fitting to bring them down here and recognize their achievement.

1123
01:29:43,014 --> 01:29:43,354
Excellent.

1124
01:29:44,075 --> 01:29:47,536
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of approval, all those in favor, those opposed, the ayes have it.

1125
01:29:47,636 --> 01:29:51,018
[SPEAKER_06]: Item 14 dash seven, seven, seven offered by counselor night.

1126
01:29:51,538 --> 01:30:03,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that an audit be performed on all taxi cab companies licensed to operate in the city of Medford to verify and ensure compliance with the ordinances of the city of Medford that govern such operation.

1127
01:30:03,823 --> 01:30:04,423
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor night.

1128
01:30:05,523 --> 01:30:06,704
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, uh,

1129
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:11,444
[SPEAKER_13]: In recent months past, we've had a licensing committee meeting to discuss the rates for taxicabs.

1130
01:30:11,804 --> 01:30:15,507
[SPEAKER_13]: We've had a number of license requests come by before this council.

1131
01:30:15,868 --> 01:30:22,874
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it's important, Mr. President, that if in fact we are going to be issuing these licenses, that we make sure that these operators are in compliance with our rules and regulations.

1132
01:30:23,134 --> 01:30:27,078
[SPEAKER_13]: There's been a lot of discussion about the implementation of a taxicab ordinance, Mr. President.

1133
01:30:27,378 --> 01:30:29,320
[SPEAKER_13]: But at this point in time, I'm going to withdraw this matter.

1134
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:33,684
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd like Councilor Marks to be here because he's expressed a number of issues of concern that he has.

1135
01:30:34,063 --> 01:30:36,484
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd like to withdraw the matter, and I'll refile it at a later date.

1136
01:30:36,684 --> 01:30:38,384
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion to withdraw, all those in favor?

1137
01:30:38,985 --> 01:30:39,545
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1138
01:30:39,585 --> 01:30:40,105
[SPEAKER_06]: The ayes have it.

1139
01:30:40,845 --> 01:30:43,886
[SPEAKER_06]: Item 14-778, offered by Councilor Penta.

1140
01:30:44,306 --> 01:30:49,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Be it resolved that the mayor's new parking slash revenue meter slash kiosk program be discussed.

1141
01:30:50,168 --> 01:30:50,808
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Penta.

1142
01:30:51,148 --> 01:31:01,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, as an update to the proposed parking by Republic, which now appears like it's not going to take place until January of this forthcoming year,

1143
01:31:03,535 --> 01:31:13,345
[SPEAKER_03]: There was something, and I have already responded to the chamber on this, there was something that was put out by the chamber basically talking about business parking implementation meetings.

1144
01:31:14,106 --> 01:31:21,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And they sent a memo out to their members, and it basically is saying that the chamber at 1 Shipyard Way in room 302 will hold four

1145
01:31:23,983 --> 01:31:36,606
[SPEAKER_03]: meetings, one for Hain Square, which is tomorrow night, one for the Meffitt Hillside in South Meffitt, which will be on Thursday, the 11th, and then next Wednesday, West Meffitt on the 17th, and then on the 18th, Meffitt Square.

1146
01:31:37,406 --> 01:31:46,628
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it says, next week, and this was issued out this past Friday, a representative from Republic Parking will be visiting the business areas to distribute flyers regarding the meetings.

1147
01:31:47,388 --> 01:31:50,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Please be sure to email or call the chamber to reserve a seat.

1148
01:31:51,149 --> 01:31:52,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Seating will be limited to 25 people,

1149
01:31:53,839 --> 01:31:54,359
[SPEAKER_03]: per meeting.

1150
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:59,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, first of all, the Chamber of Commerce has nothing to do with Republic.

1151
01:31:59,844 --> 01:32:04,328
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a city of Medford undertaking, and this was the mayor's contract with Republic.

1152
01:32:05,549 --> 01:32:12,755
[SPEAKER_03]: If the Chamber of Commerce now be the linchpin, so to speak, between the city and Republic, I just don't think that's right.

1153
01:32:12,816 --> 01:32:13,536
[SPEAKER_03]: That's number one.

1154
01:32:14,117 --> 01:32:17,720
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, to walk around and pass out a flyer

1155
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:21,633
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of information, Vice President Caravaglia.

1156
01:32:22,113 --> 01:32:27,801
[SPEAKER_20]: This was requested by Republic through the Chamber of Commerce to do this, not the Chamber of Commerce asking Republicans.

1157
01:32:28,362 --> 01:32:36,012
[SPEAKER_20]: The other way around, Republic has been trying to get out in front of this, and they're asking to do it through the Chamber of Commerce, not the opposite way around.

1158
01:32:36,332 --> 01:32:36,733
[SPEAKER_20]: Good idea.

1159
01:32:37,188 --> 01:32:43,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as a point of further information, and I think you're aware of it, not everybody in the chamber was for this and agreed to this.

1160
01:32:43,997 --> 01:32:45,338
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's be honest about it.

1161
01:32:45,398 --> 01:32:50,885
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a City of Medford undertaking, not a Chamber of Commerce undertaking, number one.

1162
01:32:51,226 --> 01:32:55,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, it's not an $18 million revenue enhancement for the City of Medford.

1163
01:32:55,953 --> 01:33:09,244
[SPEAKER_03]: The overall contract between expenditures and final payment to the city would be approximately $9 million at the end of the 10-year of the contract, not $18 million that everyone's touting and making people think that's what the city's going to get.

1164
01:33:09,705 --> 01:33:17,852
[SPEAKER_03]: But more importantly, if they were going to have these meetings and to identify the locations, number one, why would you squirrel 25 people into a room?

1165
01:33:18,619 --> 01:33:21,641
[SPEAKER_03]: just in case you've got an overflow of people, that's number one.

1166
01:33:21,681 --> 01:33:33,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, why would you be having it at 5.30 at night when a lot of the business merchants, because I spoke to them, would rather have it early in the morning because at late at night they just can't pick up and leave, and the dock of night closes their shops down if they're single proprietors.

1167
01:33:34,269 --> 01:33:40,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, and number three, and more importantly, and most importantly, if they're taking the time to walk to each one of these squares and pass out flyers,

1168
01:33:41,633 --> 01:33:51,780
[SPEAKER_03]: they could have had enough time to find a location in each one of these four squares to accommodate them in their own particular district, so they'd be able to understand firsthand what they're talking about.

1169
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I just don't think it's right, Mr. President and members of the council.

1170
01:33:56,024 --> 01:33:59,286
[SPEAKER_03]: The chamber, they do a lot of wonderful things, but this is not their ballgame.

1171
01:33:59,586 --> 01:34:01,027
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the city of Medford's ballgame.

1172
01:34:01,047 --> 01:34:02,028
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the mayor's ballgame.

1173
01:34:02,248 --> 01:34:03,589
[SPEAKER_03]: It's his package with Republic.

1174
01:34:04,029 --> 01:34:05,050
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have figured this out.

1175
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:07,132
[SPEAKER_03]: The chamber now would be the middleman.

1176
01:34:08,353 --> 01:34:11,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Cutting down whatever interferences for the mayor, I think it's wrong.

1177
01:34:11,736 --> 01:34:15,218
[SPEAKER_03]: And if this is Republic's way of doing it, they're going on the wrong foot.

1178
01:34:15,339 --> 01:34:27,768
[SPEAKER_03]: And more importantly, it would have been nice if the seven councils, if at least I, I'll speak for myself, got an invitation from Republic if we would like to participate, if you would like to be there, you have any questions or concerns.

1179
01:34:28,289 --> 01:34:30,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, the council's just excluded.

1180
01:34:31,731 --> 01:34:33,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1181
01:34:34,508 --> 01:34:43,491
[SPEAKER_13]: I received correspondence from the Chamber of Commerce inviting me to come, gave me a list of all the dates that it was coming, that it was going to be held and locations and times, emailed right to my inbox.

1182
01:34:43,871 --> 01:34:45,372
[SPEAKER_05]: I did the same, thank you.

1183
01:34:45,392 --> 01:34:47,633
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chamber of Commerce is not Republic.

1184
01:34:48,233 --> 01:34:53,455
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chamber of Commerce is not the City of Medford and they don't profess to be the City of Medford or profess to represent the City of Medford.

1185
01:34:53,835 --> 01:34:59,957
[SPEAKER_03]: The Chamber of Commerce is nothing more than a liaison that Republic is using for the purpose of selling their particular program.

1186
01:35:01,017 --> 01:35:02,057
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not their program.

1187
01:35:02,318 --> 01:35:03,438
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the City of Medford's program.

1188
01:35:03,905 --> 01:35:08,387
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the taxpayers program, and they're the ones that are gonna have to take the brunt of what all this is all about.

1189
01:35:08,747 --> 01:35:15,870
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be coming right here out of this city hall, out of this man, this is his program, and it should have been identified in all four sections of the city.

1190
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:22,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Not in the Chamber of Commerce, and not to squirrel 25 people into a room, just in case more than 25 decided to come.

1191
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:24,014
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they gonna do, tell them that they can't come?

1192
01:35:25,374 --> 01:35:26,795
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of information, Vice President.

1193
01:35:26,975 --> 01:35:33,398
[SPEAKER_20]: If there are more than 25 people attending one, they will plan to schedule another meeting to accommodate everyone.

1194
01:35:33,965 --> 01:35:36,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there in itself is the crux of the matter, Councilor Caviello.

1195
01:35:37,109 --> 01:35:40,692
[SPEAKER_03]: If more than 25 come, why would you even wait to have more than 25 come?

1196
01:35:40,933 --> 01:35:46,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't you have found a spot ahead of time that can accommodate up to 100, every one of the four locations?

1197
01:35:46,499 --> 01:35:49,202
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, this is the republic asking the chamber to

1198
01:35:49,562 --> 01:35:52,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then the chamber, if they had any brains, they'd have been able to figure this out.

1199
01:35:53,005 --> 01:35:54,025
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're a member of the chamber.

1200
01:35:54,065 --> 01:35:54,766
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a member of the chamber.

1201
01:35:54,786 --> 01:35:55,646
[SPEAKER_03]: You serve on the board.

1202
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:56,227
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got a voice.

1203
01:35:56,247 --> 01:35:56,927
[SPEAKER_03]: You can speak up.

1204
01:35:56,987 --> 01:35:58,468
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm only one vote on that board.

1205
01:35:58,508 --> 01:35:59,889
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you can speak up about it.

1206
01:35:59,909 --> 01:36:01,371
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm only one vote on that board.

1207
01:36:01,511 --> 01:36:03,652
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, maybe you should speak up a little louder.

1208
01:36:03,812 --> 01:36:04,913
[SPEAKER_20]: I speak up on multiple boards.

1209
01:36:04,933 --> 01:36:09,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor De La Rosa, you're a member of the board.

1210
01:36:09,276 --> 01:36:09,777
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think...

1211
01:36:11,895 --> 01:36:14,996
[SPEAKER_16]: should be placed under some sort of cross-examination by the consular.

1212
01:36:15,376 --> 01:36:20,098
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm dreadfully sorry that the world doesn't revolve to his liking.

1213
01:36:20,718 --> 01:36:20,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1214
01:36:21,018 --> 01:36:22,499
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to be dreadfully sorry.

1215
01:36:22,799 --> 01:36:25,780
[SPEAKER_03]: You should just stand up and speak up and take a position and that's all.

1216
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,300
[SPEAKER_03]: And the position is very clear.

1217
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:34,942
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a member of the chamber and you know that there are four sections of the city that are going to be affected, why would you want to put 25 people into a room and you had more than 25?

1218
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:36,723
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to set the time for another time.

1219
01:36:37,363 --> 01:36:40,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you just find the location and the area that they're going to be?

1220
01:36:40,305 --> 01:36:41,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information.

1221
01:36:41,105 --> 01:36:54,053
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe, I believe consulate Dela Russo voted in favor of a resolution asking Republic to come to each individual business district here in the city to present an information session with the business owners and the residents thereof.

1222
01:36:54,373 --> 01:36:55,854
[SPEAKER_13]: He voted in support of this resolution.

1223
01:36:55,874 --> 01:36:58,976
[SPEAKER_13]: The resolution was brought forward maybe seven weeks ago and it passed six to one.

1224
01:36:59,616 --> 01:37:03,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so I think that when you say have a voice, consulate Dela Russo did have a voice.

1225
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:06,162
[SPEAKER_13]: He used his voice here as a councilor to speak about his position on that.

1226
01:37:06,482 --> 01:37:13,446
[SPEAKER_13]: What's going on in the Chamber of Commerce and this private organization and the private decisions that they make really has no effect on what we do here as a council.

1227
01:37:13,467 --> 01:37:14,587
[SPEAKER_03]: I disagree with you, Councilor.

1228
01:37:14,607 --> 01:37:15,428
[SPEAKER_06]: This is over and above.

1229
01:37:15,448 --> 01:37:16,508
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a private entity.

1230
01:37:16,528 --> 01:37:18,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be a private entity, but it is not over and above.

1231
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:21,031
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not the Chamber's issue.

1232
01:37:21,512 --> 01:37:22,592
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the City of Medford.

1233
01:37:22,913 --> 01:37:24,073
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the Mayor's position.

1234
01:37:24,394 --> 01:37:25,254
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the contract.

1235
01:37:25,294 --> 01:37:29,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe the Chamber members... So is this about the Chamber or about your feelings towards the Mayor?

1236
01:37:30,127 --> 01:37:31,028
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's neither of that.

1237
01:37:31,068 --> 01:37:34,430
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the idea that this is a City of Medford contract, is it not?

1238
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:37,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it not a City of Medford contract, Councilor DelaRusso?

1239
01:37:37,812 --> 01:37:39,933
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a City of Medford contract, but Republic.

1240
01:37:39,953 --> 01:37:42,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry things don't go the way you'd like them.

1241
01:37:42,214 --> 01:37:45,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sorry things don't go your way all the time as well, okay?

1242
01:37:45,756 --> 01:37:52,980
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe if you were more active, you'd have an understanding, and if you walk the streets, and you listen to the people... Councilor, enough of the cheap shots.

1243
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,341
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a cheap shot saying...

1244
01:37:56,121 --> 01:37:56,462
[SPEAKER_06]: All of this.

1245
01:37:56,982 --> 01:37:57,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

1246
01:37:57,363 --> 01:37:57,984
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in your mind.

1247
01:37:58,024 --> 01:37:58,284
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1248
01:37:58,384 --> 01:37:59,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, that's in your mind.

1249
01:37:59,686 --> 01:38:00,627
[SPEAKER_03]: It isn't in my mind.

1250
01:38:00,727 --> 01:38:05,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I've walked the streets and I talked to these business people and they would like to have had it in a particular area.

1251
01:38:07,266 --> 01:38:08,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, who's taking the cheap shot?

1252
01:38:08,648 --> 01:38:09,368
[SPEAKER_03]: You and me right now.

1253
01:38:09,528 --> 01:38:13,092
[SPEAKER_06]: No, some of them, some of them specifically said that they're happy about these meetings and they're glad.

1254
01:38:13,132 --> 01:38:13,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1255
01:38:13,353 --> 01:38:14,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's some of them that don't.

1256
01:38:14,574 --> 01:38:14,894
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1257
01:38:14,994 --> 01:38:15,895
[SPEAKER_03]: And it goes both ways.

1258
01:38:15,935 --> 01:38:17,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a private entity that's inviting them, not the city.

1259
01:38:17,918 --> 01:38:19,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a private entity that's writing them.

1260
01:38:19,459 --> 01:38:27,348
[SPEAKER_03]: But unfortunately the private entity is doing business with the city as part of a public contract and public dollars are involved and it's just my, it's just my, Hey, listen.

1261
01:38:27,867 --> 01:38:30,049
[SPEAKER_03]: It's my opportunity, it's my personal opinion, and that's what I'm saying.

1262
01:38:30,469 --> 01:38:32,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm making my opinion, and Councilor De La Rosa doesn't like it.

1263
01:38:33,011 --> 01:38:34,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to apologize for him not liking it.

1264
01:38:34,932 --> 01:38:37,654
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't like half the things I do, and I don't like half the things he does.

1265
01:38:37,914 --> 01:38:38,815
[SPEAKER_03]: So what difference does it make?

1266
01:38:39,235 --> 01:38:40,756
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our right, that's our freedom of speech.

1267
01:38:41,157 --> 01:38:47,081
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our way of saying what we want to say on a subject matter that means something, and this means something to me, because I hear the people talking.

1268
01:38:47,601 --> 01:38:49,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And now what are we going to do, Mr. President?

1269
01:38:49,963 --> 01:38:54,726
[SPEAKER_03]: When it snows out, we haven't even figured out who is going to plow the sidewalks where these meters are.

1270
01:38:55,027 --> 01:38:56,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it going to be the city's responsibility?

1271
01:38:57,048 --> 01:38:58,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it going to be republics?

1272
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:03,153
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens when a senior citizen or a handicapped person can't get to the meeting?

1273
01:39:03,873 --> 01:39:08,336
[SPEAKER_03]: These are issues that need to be discussed and be brought out publicly to have a discussion on.

1274
01:39:09,077 --> 01:39:09,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Still not to have it.

1275
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:13,880
[SPEAKER_03]: And they still haven't been able to identify the 932 parking spaces.

1276
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:15,081
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still up in the air.

1277
01:39:15,702 --> 01:39:16,742
[SPEAKER_03]: So what did we accomplish?

1278
01:39:16,983 --> 01:39:21,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And what has been accomplished by having republic come in when these haven't even been finalized?

1279
01:39:21,926 --> 01:39:33,380
[SPEAKER_06]: This is, like Councilor DelaRusso said, and Vice President Caraviello, this is a meeting of a private entity known as the Chamber of Commerce, who is doing outreach for their members, and I applaud them.

1280
01:39:33,741 --> 01:39:35,783
[SPEAKER_06]: So, do you have a motion, Councilor?

1281
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:41,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to let the people know that this particular meeting, these particular meetings, I feel,

1282
01:39:41,715 --> 01:39:44,777
[SPEAKER_03]: should have been in the four particular areas rather than in the chamber's office.

1283
01:39:45,097 --> 01:39:49,860
[SPEAKER_03]: They could have still been the sponsor, but they could have had places where more than 25 people could have come.

1284
01:39:50,181 --> 01:39:56,365
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they had it early in the morning rather than later at night, that's what the calls were that I got from people.

1285
01:39:56,625 --> 01:39:59,267
[SPEAKER_03]: If they were going to go, they would have prefaced being there.

1286
01:40:00,367 --> 01:40:02,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I would encourage you to put them all together in a room.

1287
01:40:02,749 --> 01:40:07,552
[SPEAKER_20]: Most people that were asked by the chamber for the evening meeting versus the day meeting.

1288
01:40:07,737 --> 01:40:11,178
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, maybe that's the people you spoke to as compared to the people I spoke to.

1289
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:12,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had this conversation Sunday.

1290
01:40:13,059 --> 01:40:17,021
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the chamber, most people had preferred the evening meeting after work hours.

1291
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:20,302
[SPEAKER_03]: When you say through the chamber, you're talking about the chamber, I'm talking about the business people.

1292
01:40:20,322 --> 01:40:23,203
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of business people, Rick, that aren't chamber members.

1293
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:34,448
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the people that were contacted, they preferred the later hour when it was more convenient for them, because most of them open at eight o'clock in the morning, and they'd rather be there in the morning.

1294
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:37,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they can't be there at 530 at night either, so what do they do?

1295
01:40:37,501 --> 01:40:38,781
[SPEAKER_20]: Most of them are closed by that time.

1296
01:40:38,841 --> 01:40:40,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to disagree with you.

1297
01:40:40,301 --> 01:40:40,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

1298
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:51,224
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, listen, again, this is, this is Republic asking the chamber to help them out and help facilitate this to the business areas.

1299
01:40:52,024 --> 01:40:53,784
[SPEAKER_20]: This is not the chamber doing it on their own.

1300
01:40:54,424 --> 01:40:57,905
[SPEAKER_20]: This is, it's part of the work that the chamber does.

1301
01:40:59,154 --> 01:41:00,255
[SPEAKER_20]: This is outreach.

1302
01:41:00,675 --> 01:41:05,240
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know there's a lot of businesses out there that are not members of the chamber that were also invited.

1303
01:41:06,381 --> 01:41:08,763
[SPEAKER_06]: So this isn't chamber only specific.

1304
01:41:08,803 --> 01:41:09,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Counselor Knight.

1305
01:41:09,884 --> 01:41:13,968
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it seems like Republic's willing to do some outreach work, huh?

1306
01:41:14,769 --> 01:41:15,870
[SPEAKER_13]: If they're willing to come and meet.

1307
01:41:17,528 --> 01:41:28,070
[SPEAKER_20]: The Republicans, they're trying to do some type of, I've seen some of the things that the Republicans are looking to do with the businesses, with people that do get tickets.

1308
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:34,971
[SPEAKER_20]: They're trying to work with the businesses on their website to do different things with people who do get tickets.

1309
01:41:36,111 --> 01:41:40,672
[SPEAKER_20]: And one more last thing, handicapped people don't pay the meters.

1310
01:41:43,152 --> 01:41:46,033
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't have to worry about putting money in by law.

1311
01:41:50,085 --> 01:41:54,811
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, Mr. President, it's clear, I think, that republic's willing to do some outreach work.

1312
01:41:54,831 --> 01:41:56,273
[SPEAKER_13]: We've seen them at community day.

1313
01:41:56,313 --> 01:41:59,577
[SPEAKER_13]: We've seen them at a number of events that have gone on that the city sponsored.

1314
01:41:59,597 --> 01:42:04,943
[SPEAKER_13]: Now we're seeing them take the efforts to go and meet with the chamber of commerce, not on one night, not on two nights, not on three nights, but on four nights.

1315
01:42:05,484 --> 01:42:07,527
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that, you know,

1316
01:42:08,565 --> 01:42:13,312
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be remiss if I didn't say that maybe we should just call Republic and ask them to put something together.

1317
01:42:13,332 --> 01:42:17,998
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we have any constituents that have contacted us, we can have the same type of info session in room 201 or room 207.

1318
01:42:18,099 --> 01:42:24,007
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we'd be more than able to have a meeting with, I think Republic would be more than happy to come down to a council meeting.

1319
01:42:24,623 --> 01:42:25,404
[SPEAKER_20]: to answer any questions.

1320
01:42:25,464 --> 01:42:26,765
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, they've been there, they've done that.

1321
01:42:26,805 --> 01:42:28,747
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they've answered our questions for the most part.

1322
01:42:28,787 --> 01:42:34,211
[SPEAKER_20]: I think there'd be more than anybody to come down here and answer any questions.

1323
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:36,393
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm already working, I'm putting my own meetings together.

1324
01:42:36,934 --> 01:42:44,440
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of their track record and what they've shown us that they're willing to do, I don't think that there'd be any reason to think that they wouldn't be willing to continue to do such.

1325
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,583
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that it might make sense if we can reach out to

1326
01:42:48,604 --> 01:42:54,048
[SPEAKER_13]: find out who the City of Medford liaison is, and then we can deal with these things on a case-by-case basis with that individual directly.

1327
01:42:54,408 --> 01:42:57,651
[SPEAKER_13]: If we needed to put them in a room with 10 or 11 or 13 people, then so be it.

1328
01:42:57,671 --> 01:43:04,796
[SPEAKER_13]: If business owners are calling you and they need answers, I don't think that this gentleman is going to be too afraid to come up here and give answers to the questions.

1329
01:43:04,816 --> 01:43:05,597
[SPEAKER_13]: The contract is signed.

1330
01:43:05,657 --> 01:43:08,099
[SPEAKER_13]: He is here.

1331
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:08,799
[SPEAKER_13]: At the end of the day,

1332
01:43:09,987 --> 01:43:10,227
[SPEAKER_13]: He's here.

1333
01:43:10,247 --> 01:43:11,268
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to have to live with him.

1334
01:43:11,328 --> 01:43:15,670
[SPEAKER_13]: So I don't think that they're going to want to start off on the wrong foot and create a relationship like that.

1335
01:43:16,551 --> 01:43:24,816
[SPEAKER_13]: I really think that based on what they've shown us already, that they're willing to be a part of the conversation, to come in and to talk and to answer the questions and to show us how they want to implement this.

1336
01:43:25,896 --> 01:43:35,982
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, Mr. President, you know, I'd certainly be interested to find out what the contact information is for the liaison for Republic so that I can go and do some of that work.

1337
01:43:36,378 --> 01:43:38,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I don't need an official action to this council to get that information.

1338
01:43:38,881 --> 01:43:41,143
[SPEAKER_13]: I can make the, make the full call and do it my own.

1339
01:43:41,644 --> 01:43:47,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, however, I think that that might make a little bit more sense than, than, you know, it'll get us some results.

1340
01:43:47,370 --> 01:43:48,971
[SPEAKER_13]: It'll bring us, it'll bring us to the end of the road yet.

1341
01:43:49,792 --> 01:43:54,377
[SPEAKER_06]: And the mayor, um, we'll be doing outreach in several different ways.

1342
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:57,232
[SPEAKER_06]: once all the information is readily available.

1343
01:43:58,093 --> 01:43:59,874
[SPEAKER_06]: City hasn't started the process yet.

1344
01:44:00,175 --> 01:44:01,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Pentzer and the gentleman at the podium.

1345
01:44:01,976 --> 01:44:05,760
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're talking about, Mr. President, is everything that was discussed back in October.

1346
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:06,601
[SPEAKER_03]: October 1st.

1347
01:44:08,245 --> 01:44:14,467
[SPEAKER_03]: as reported, and it was a council meeting just prior to October 1st, where we had these discussions of having them come forward.

1348
01:44:15,107 --> 01:44:15,907
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was your comment.

1349
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,868
[SPEAKER_03]: It was your comment at that meeting.

1350
01:44:18,268 --> 01:44:23,230
[SPEAKER_03]: And you said that this whole parking scenario is going to be a tough pill for the business people to swallow.

1351
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:24,110
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you said.

1352
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:26,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's right here.

1353
01:44:26,370 --> 01:44:28,371
[SPEAKER_13]: I have it right here.

1354
01:44:28,831 --> 01:44:29,952
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he said it's a tough pill.

1355
01:44:29,992 --> 01:44:31,392
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be a tough pill to swallow.

1356
01:44:31,652 --> 01:44:32,212
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your quote.

1357
01:44:32,272 --> 01:44:32,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1358
01:44:33,273 --> 01:44:33,853
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on the tape.

1359
01:44:34,053 --> 01:44:34,673
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on your quote.

1360
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:40,363
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that being said, and recognizing then from October to now, from October to now, there's been nothing.

1361
01:44:40,623 --> 01:44:45,526
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of the people in the business districts don't know who's gonna be getting these meters, who's not gonna be getting them.

1362
01:44:45,546 --> 01:44:48,528
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the purpose of the meetings, to help to inform them.

1363
01:44:49,929 --> 01:44:56,573
[SPEAKER_20]: If the mayor wants to have private meetings and separate meetings, I'm sure he'll have them, or maybe that's in his plans.

1364
01:44:56,633 --> 01:44:58,114
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't speak for the mayor.

1365
01:44:59,555 --> 01:45:03,277
[SPEAKER_20]: The chamber's trying to do their part to help everyone

1366
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:14,166
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe it would have been nice if the council was advised and maybe we had an opportunity to see what was going on rather than have to get an invite or hear something that the chamber's sponsoring.

1367
01:45:15,027 --> 01:45:17,908
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to tag along, you can come along.

1368
01:45:18,008 --> 01:45:20,069
[SPEAKER_20]: Those meetings are open to everyone that wants to attend.

1369
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:21,911
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no conspiracy here.

1370
01:45:21,951 --> 01:45:22,531
[SPEAKER_03]: This is public health.

1371
01:45:22,551 --> 01:45:23,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say that.

1372
01:45:23,171 --> 01:45:23,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody said that.

1373
01:45:25,693 --> 01:45:27,094
[SPEAKER_20]: Again, it's here to stay.

1374
01:45:28,594 --> 01:45:31,236
[SPEAKER_20]: It's here and they're trying to make the best out of it.

1375
01:45:32,023 --> 01:45:33,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record.

1376
01:45:33,483 --> 01:45:35,424
[SPEAKER_02]: John Stirola, 20 Metcalf Street.

1377
01:45:36,244 --> 01:45:37,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1378
01:45:38,525 --> 01:45:40,365
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an opinion on this matter, too.

1379
01:45:40,905 --> 01:45:47,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the council should never, never have given the mayor permission to sign a 10-year contract.

1380
01:45:48,227 --> 01:45:50,587
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one power they had.

1381
01:45:50,687 --> 01:45:53,188
[SPEAKER_02]: They gave it up easily, as usual.

1382
01:45:54,968 --> 01:45:57,669
[SPEAKER_02]: He already had the power to sign a three-year contract.

1383
01:45:58,609 --> 01:46:01,710
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that event, the damage would have been minimized.

1384
01:46:03,005 --> 01:46:05,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a crystal ball, but I do want to make a point.

1385
01:46:07,869 --> 01:46:15,115
[SPEAKER_02]: The administration and the people of this city are going to regret that paid parking was ever installed.

1386
01:46:18,137 --> 01:46:19,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address for the record, sir.

1387
01:46:20,272 --> 01:46:23,113
[SPEAKER_22]: John Byers, 22 Alston Street, Medford.

1388
01:46:23,273 --> 01:46:26,053
[SPEAKER_22]: Just a point of context here in this whole conversation.

1389
01:46:27,573 --> 01:46:47,037
[SPEAKER_22]: This was the mayor's veiled attempt at making brownie points after being called out on TV three times by the citizens and having Channel 5 and Channel 7 come down and their investigators do reports on how poor the city of Medford

1390
01:46:47,444 --> 01:46:49,506
[SPEAKER_22]: takes care of its parking problems.

1391
01:46:50,186 --> 01:47:04,336
[SPEAKER_22]: And the mayor did this because he got thoroughly embarrassed and he tried to throw this council under the proverbial bus saying that this council did not want to do anything to curb the parking problem.

1392
01:47:04,776 --> 01:47:07,318
[SPEAKER_22]: So this is his way of saying, screw you Medford.

1393
01:47:07,799 --> 01:47:10,060
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm doing this without your permission.

1394
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,943
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1395
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:17,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Pinto's motion receive a place on file.

1396
01:47:20,421 --> 01:47:20,661
[SPEAKER_03]: John.

1397
01:47:23,402 --> 01:47:23,982
[SPEAKER_03]: One last thing.

1398
01:47:24,022 --> 01:47:29,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you forgot to mention and that whole commentary that you just talked about when channel seven came.

1399
01:47:29,103 --> 01:47:29,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1400
01:47:30,083 --> 01:47:33,024
[SPEAKER_03]: What was the comment that the mayor made when they were asked him about the public park?

1401
01:47:33,124 --> 01:47:40,246
[SPEAKER_22]: He said the city council will not allow us to do what we need to do to help the parking problem.

1402
01:47:40,266 --> 01:47:42,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he said, I think he said, John,

1403
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:45,451
[SPEAKER_03]: that the council did not put the money in the budget for them.

1404
01:47:45,491 --> 01:47:47,332
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's absolutely not true.

1405
01:47:47,352 --> 01:47:48,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is totally not true.

1406
01:47:48,893 --> 01:47:51,394
[SPEAKER_03]: This council each and every year has been supportive of them.

1407
01:47:51,514 --> 01:48:05,900
[SPEAKER_22]: And just to make a further point, after seeing that report, I called Hank Philippi Ryan and I spoke to someone at Channel 7 and made the point to them that the mayor totally had lied to Hank Philippi Ryan in making

1408
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:12,007
[SPEAKER_22]: And I pointed out that the mayor threw the council under the bus.

1409
01:48:12,387 --> 01:48:17,474
[SPEAKER_22]: I told him, Councilor Michael J. Marks has been asking for a number of years.

1410
01:48:19,014 --> 01:48:26,320
[SPEAKER_22]: about getting a comprehensive parking program in the city, and every time he is blocked by this mayor.

1411
01:48:27,101 --> 01:48:33,967
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, the mayor, as I said, was called out three times within less than a year's time by Channel 5.

1412
01:48:34,207 --> 01:48:36,649
[SPEAKER_22]: When Channel 5 was called down about the

1413
01:48:43,015 --> 01:48:47,799
[SPEAKER_22]: the inaccurate information being given about odd even parking during the winter.

1414
01:48:47,819 --> 01:49:00,589
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the parking program and the, oh God, I'm losing my train of thought here.

1415
01:49:00,809 --> 01:49:01,930
[SPEAKER_22]: The, oh.

1416
01:49:03,771 --> 01:49:04,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Relax, take it, it'll come.

1417
01:49:14,283 --> 01:49:27,347
[SPEAKER_22]: Basically what I'm saying is what has to happen is this council as a whole has to proverbial grow a set, stand up to the smear and say no, we're not going to allow this.

1418
01:49:27,367 --> 01:49:32,489
[SPEAKER_22]: The last time we had parking meters in this city, there were problems and we ended up pulling them out.

1419
01:49:32,549 --> 01:49:35,930
[SPEAKER_22]: Now the smear wants to throw us back into the stone age again.

1420
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:37,590
[SPEAKER_22]: with parking meters.

1421
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:38,730
[SPEAKER_22]: That isn't the way to go.

1422
01:49:38,810 --> 01:49:43,211
[SPEAKER_22]: The way to go is to have a comprehensive parking program, and that's it.

1423
01:49:43,791 --> 01:49:47,752
[SPEAKER_22]: What I was trying to say is about the permitted parking, by the way.

1424
01:49:47,812 --> 01:49:59,975
[SPEAKER_22]: That's what I was going to mention, the fact that the permitted parking and people are being told after they have paid their permits to park.

1425
01:50:03,035 --> 01:50:03,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1426
01:50:03,916 --> 01:50:05,816
[SPEAKER_06]: All in the motion receive and place on file.

1427
01:50:07,752 --> 01:50:08,312
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1428
01:50:08,352 --> 01:50:08,893
[SPEAKER_06]: The ayes have it.

1429
01:50:09,314 --> 01:50:10,395
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two sets of records.

1430
01:50:10,816 --> 01:50:15,301
[SPEAKER_06]: Councillor... Suspension of the rules.

1431
01:50:21,058 --> 01:50:23,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

1432
01:50:23,719 --> 01:50:36,202
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to inform the public that yesterday I attended a press conference the mayor had with a Comcast representative, Sheila Willett, very nice woman, speaking about a program, an old program that Comcast had.

1433
01:50:36,502 --> 01:50:37,362
[SPEAKER_04]: It's seven years old.

1434
01:50:38,003 --> 01:50:39,383
[SPEAKER_04]: They put it aside and now it's back.

1435
01:50:39,403 --> 01:50:40,323
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Every Block.

1436
01:50:41,164 --> 01:50:45,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can go on the city website and see Every Block and get the press release.

1437
01:50:45,525 --> 01:50:45,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me.

1438
01:50:45,925 --> 01:50:46,905
[SPEAKER_06]: One second.

1439
01:50:47,385 --> 01:50:50,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you gentlemen take the conversation outside please so we can hear the

1440
01:50:50,705 --> 01:50:51,486
[SPEAKER_06]: The guy at the podium.

1441
01:50:52,347 --> 01:50:54,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, sir.

1442
01:50:54,129 --> 01:50:55,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Council President, thank you.

1443
01:50:56,871 --> 01:51:00,035
[SPEAKER_04]: This Everyblock, you can do a web search on it.

1444
01:51:00,255 --> 01:51:02,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's everyblock.com, but search it to make sure.

1445
01:51:03,238 --> 01:51:05,020
[SPEAKER_04]: And the city website does have information.

1446
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,101
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's intriguing.

1447
01:51:07,856 --> 01:51:11,439
[SPEAKER_04]: The woman from Comcast asked if there were any questions, and no one asked a question.

1448
01:51:11,479 --> 01:51:17,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, well, we already pay Comcast for Peg Access, and we're not getting the product.

1449
01:51:18,003 --> 01:51:19,544
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you elaborate on that?

1450
01:51:19,725 --> 01:51:25,889
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mayor went up, and Councilor Caraviello was there, along with Tim Kelly from Comcast.

1451
01:51:26,009 --> 01:51:33,655
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mayor said, next week, there will be a press conference, and that he is going to give us an access TV station.

1452
01:51:34,528 --> 01:51:37,271
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want the council to hold the mayor at his word.

1453
01:51:38,693 --> 01:51:49,125
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been nice if that press conference yesterday was held in Alden Chambers, and I would hope the city council can respectfully ask the mayor to start having more public hearings.

1454
01:51:49,185 --> 01:51:52,749
[SPEAKER_04]: That videotape I did of the parking meter video

1455
01:51:53,897 --> 01:51:56,939
[SPEAKER_04]: That was an important meeting with people out the door.

1456
01:51:57,019 --> 01:51:58,620
[SPEAKER_04]: It would have been great to have it here.

1457
01:51:59,061 --> 01:52:04,064
[SPEAKER_04]: These chambers are wonderful, hallowed halls, and I think that they would serve this city well.

1458
01:52:04,485 --> 01:52:09,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, that conference was about every block.

1459
01:52:09,708 --> 01:52:16,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Next week, we're going to have a preface conference, according to the mayor, on his new proposal for an access TV station.

1460
01:52:17,454 --> 01:52:19,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Please, City Council, hold him to his promise.

1461
01:52:20,536 --> 01:52:21,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to hear him go back on it.

1462
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:25,878
[SPEAKER_06]: There'll be an announcement on the forthcoming.

1463
01:52:27,292 --> 01:52:28,692
[SPEAKER_22]: I do have a comment on this again.

1464
01:52:28,752 --> 01:52:30,633
[SPEAKER_22]: John Byers, 22 Wall Street.

1465
01:52:32,573 --> 01:52:36,974
[SPEAKER_22]: This idea of the mayor saying there's going to be an access station, there has to be one thing made clear.

1466
01:52:37,514 --> 01:52:44,215
[SPEAKER_22]: We will not accept any of the mayor's cronies running the access station, that being a Mr. Jack Dempsey.

1467
01:52:44,675 --> 01:52:48,956
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to have someone that is not involved in the mayor's circle.

1468
01:52:49,016 --> 01:52:49,896
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information.

1469
01:52:49,916 --> 01:52:52,817
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think we need to name the gentleman by name over here, Mr. President.

1470
01:52:52,837 --> 01:52:53,537
[SPEAKER_14]: That's inappropriate.

1471
01:52:54,371 --> 01:53:05,696
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I'm sorry you don't like that, but we can't have people like that running the access station, because basically what will end up happening- The same thing can be said about a number of people, you know what I mean, Mr. President?

1472
01:53:05,716 --> 01:53:08,017
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't think it's conducive to a positive debate.

1473
01:53:08,077 --> 01:53:10,578
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor will be appointing people that he feels fit.

1474
01:53:13,207 --> 01:53:18,790
[SPEAKER_22]: We can't have any of that because if that happens, then he'll have control of the station.

1475
01:53:19,390 --> 01:53:24,633
[SPEAKER_22]: And people like me who have been outspoken against him will not be allowed on that station.

1476
01:53:24,673 --> 01:53:31,477
[SPEAKER_06]: He'll keep people that have... Mr. Baez, you'll always be allowed at the access station if you're a member in good standing.

1477
01:53:31,797 --> 01:53:31,997
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1478
01:53:32,277 --> 01:53:35,078
[SPEAKER_06]: You will always be allowed at the Medford access station.

1479
01:53:35,559 --> 01:53:38,480
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are a member in good standing, no one's going to keep you out.

1480
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:45,783
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I, I'm not saying, I'm not saying that I'm going to be kicked out, but there'll be stringent rules put against me because I've been outspoken against him.

1481
01:53:46,043 --> 01:53:46,723
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

1482
01:53:47,124 --> 01:53:47,664
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, sir.

1483
01:53:49,425 --> 01:53:52,286
[SPEAKER_06]: The records of November 25th were passed the council.

1484
01:53:52,526 --> 01:53:56,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President on page number two 12,

1485
01:53:58,786 --> 01:54:13,655
[SPEAKER_03]: under resolution 14754, amendment number C. It's by amendment, it says amended by Councilor Panter and Councilor Longo-Curran, that OCD report back on what has information they have.

1486
01:54:14,315 --> 01:54:16,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what that means, it doesn't make any sense.

1487
01:54:19,518 --> 01:54:21,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's go to page, go page 12, 14754, number C.

1488
01:54:27,608 --> 01:54:31,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we go to, you got it?

1489
01:54:33,312 --> 01:54:33,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1490
01:54:34,632 --> 01:54:39,335
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the correction, I don't know what the term, the sentence doesn't make sense.

1491
01:54:40,356 --> 01:54:43,338
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm telling you that needs to be corrected.

1492
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:49,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reading section C here, it doesn't make sense, the second line.

1493
01:54:49,882 --> 01:54:53,784
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you have, and you have to go back to the tape and look at it, I don't know.

1494
01:54:54,524 --> 01:54:55,125
[SPEAKER_03]: You take a look at it?

1495
01:54:56,005 --> 01:54:56,926
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make any sense.

1496
01:54:57,417 --> 01:55:10,401
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we go to page 213, 14759, and under A, after the word but, that doesn't make sense.

1497
01:55:14,943 --> 01:55:21,525
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, vended by myself of a street, if your street was not swept, but were tagged, ticket and towed,

1498
01:55:22,449 --> 01:55:24,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's a resident or if it means your car.

1499
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:26,511
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I don't know what it's supposed to be.

1500
01:55:26,531 --> 01:55:27,932
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna have to go back and look at the tape.

1501
01:55:28,352 --> 01:55:31,394
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the one you said to go to the mayor and take care of the tickets.

1502
01:55:31,654 --> 01:55:32,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but it doesn't say that.

1503
01:55:33,775 --> 01:55:45,041
[SPEAKER_03]: It says, if your street, if your street was not swept, but were tagged, ticketed, and towed, is it your car or a resident was tagged?

1504
01:55:45,341 --> 01:55:47,362
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, maybe it's a resident's car.

1505
01:55:47,723 --> 01:55:49,764
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe those are the appropriate words that have to be put in there.

1506
01:55:50,264 --> 01:55:51,685
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what but were tagged means.

1507
01:55:52,793 --> 01:55:58,895
[SPEAKER_03]: What's, what's Eddie just, just go, just the sentence.

1508
01:55:58,935 --> 01:56:03,036
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't make sense to take a look at the tape and we can figure out exactly what it is.

1509
01:56:05,737 --> 01:56:07,237
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to table those still.

1510
01:56:08,017 --> 01:56:09,758
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I have no problem as long as he corrects them.

1511
01:56:09,778 --> 01:56:10,118
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

1512
01:56:10,138 --> 01:56:16,620
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's grammar, but it doesn't, it's not making any sense on the motion with further clarification of approval.

1513
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:19,030
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1514
01:56:19,311 --> 01:56:19,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1515
01:56:20,011 --> 01:56:20,611
[SPEAKER_06]: All those opposed?

1516
01:56:20,632 --> 01:56:21,152
[SPEAKER_06]: The ayes have it.

1517
01:56:21,492 --> 01:56:24,654
[SPEAKER_06]: The records of December 2nd were passed to Vice President Carabiello.

1518
01:56:25,795 --> 01:56:26,455
[SPEAKER_06]: How did you find them?

1519
01:56:30,478 --> 01:56:31,499
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of approval.

1520
01:56:32,779 --> 01:56:33,480
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1521
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:33,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1522
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:34,721
