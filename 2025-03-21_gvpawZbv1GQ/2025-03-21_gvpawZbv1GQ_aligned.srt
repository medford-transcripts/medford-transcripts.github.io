18
00:00:56,519 --> 00:01:03,082
Just for the viewing public, Councilor Marks was here at a meeting, and he had to leave for a flooding emergency at his house.

19
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:05,863
But he was here, and that is why he is not here right now.

20
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:11,365
He's dealing with a serious flooding situation at his house.

21
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:14,426
Chair recognizes Councilor De La Russo.

22

All those opposed?

26
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,155
The ayes have it.

27
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:30,518

By order of the City Council, Edward P. Finn, City Clerk.

35
00:02:33,496 --> 00:02:36,497
This was advertised in the Medford Mercury on November 21st,

36
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,698
in December 1st, 2014.

37

At this time, I will declare the public hearing open.

38
00:02:45,305 --> 00:02:51,672
All those in favor of the project and of the drive-thru, all those in favor, please come forward.

39
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,293
Name and address for the record.

40
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:09,506
Why don't you just take it away, Larry?

41
00:03:13,909 --> 00:03:14,529
It's something else.

42
00:03:14,649 --> 00:03:19,212
It's giving us feedback.

43
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:21,234
Stand by, please, while the people out back.

44
00:03:22,154 --> 00:03:22,575
There we go.

45
00:03:22,595 --> 00:03:24,736
Is that a little better?

46
00:03:24,756 --> 00:03:29,599
I apologize.

47
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:30,820
They're working on this out back.

48
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:33,182
All right.

49
00:03:33,782 --> 00:03:35,223
Name and address for the record, please.

50
00:03:35,684 --> 00:03:38,806
This is the public hearing for those in favor of the drive-thru.

51
00:03:39,607 --> 00:03:40,147
Good evening.

52
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,688
My name is Karen Johnson.

53
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:45,031
I'm a resident of Arlington, Mass.

54
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:50,455
I'm here tonight on behalf of Felsway Property, which is located on Riverside Avenue.

55
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:52,857
Address, please.

56
00:03:52,877 --> 00:03:55,539
88 Woodside Lane in Arlington, Mass.

57
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:56,880
Thank you.

58
00:03:57,283 --> 00:03:57,743
Thank you.

59
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:01,707
Good evening, members of the Council.

60
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:12,937
We first appeared before you approximately a year ago, pretty close to a year ago this evening, when the Nor'easter that evening was a snowstorm.

61
00:04:13,578 --> 00:04:19,924
We met before the Committee of the Whole to introduce ourselves to you as the new owners of Felsway Plaza.

62
00:04:20,778 --> 00:04:32,862
And at the time, we reviewed our proposals for improvements to the plaza, including facade renovations and the exciting news for new tenants.

63
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:38,704
And we briefly discussed at the time our proposal for a restaurant pad along Riverside.

64
00:04:40,644 --> 00:04:41,885
During our introduction, we

65
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:49,887
We wanted to assure you that when we represented something to a community that we followed through.

66
00:04:50,187 --> 00:05:06,060
And I hope that you certainly and the residents of Medford are very pleased with the results of our facade renovations and see the investments that we've so far made in a very outdated and underutilized property.

67
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,303
We are very excited about the progress that we have made so far.

68
00:05:11,212 --> 00:05:19,316
There's a lot happening out there that you don't see and it results in significant investment in the infrastructure for Felsway Plaza.

69
00:05:20,677 --> 00:05:26,040
And so the continuation of that is the proposed restaurant pad along Riverside.

70
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:35,825
We presented our application for special permit for site plan review to the Community Development Board in August and received approval from them at the time.

71
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:46,253
We're here before you this evening for the application for the drive-through for the Panera use, which of course is a special permit before the city council.

72
00:05:47,153 --> 00:06:04,276
The Panera, and shown on the plan and in your application materials, is tenant A, and we're very excited to have Panera and Smashburger, which recently received Common Vic and I believe also a liquor license from the council,

73
00:06:04,878 --> 00:06:20,230
and then Noodles as Tenant C. Through the process of our approvals before the Community Development Board, we also had an opportunity to meet with several of the neighbors along the 4th Street neighborhood.

74
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:28,997
They had raised some concerns about the general overall condition of the property, and specifically, they had concerns related to odor control.

75
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:46,478
We're very pleased that so far our tenants have agreed through the process of receiving the Common Vic license from the city council to employ additional odor control mechanisms and our other tenants are also amenable to that as well.

76
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:57,182
So we think that we've presented a great plan for Fells Lake Plaza, a great plan for this property and we have

77
00:06:57,838 --> 00:07:06,680
opened a line of communication with the neighbors in the area, which I believe really was not existent before we took title to the property.

78
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:16,082
So we hope that you find this along the same lines as the balance of our work that we've done in Medford.

79
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:21,743
Joining me this evening in the event you have any questions are Ken Staffia, our civil engineer from

80
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:27,723
VHB, and also Pat Dunford, who is our traffic engineer, also from VHB.

81
00:07:28,763 --> 00:07:37,188
I am sorry to report that our attorney, Bob Abruzzi, has had a medical issue, and he is not able to be present this evening.

82
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:47,954
So we will try to answer as many questions as you can, but think that we may have to continue some portion of this matter until Bob can be present.

83
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,620
Is there any questions?

84
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:50,620
Okay.

85
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,981
The public hearing is still open.

86
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:59,102
Anyone else in favour?

87
00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:03,103
I promised her I'd get up here and just say I'm in favour.

88
00:08:03,243 --> 00:08:03,523
Thank you.

89
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:05,883
Anyone else in favour?

90
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:11,965
Hearing and seeing none, I now close that portion of the hearing and open it up to anybody in opposition.

91
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:23,285
Good evening.

92
00:08:23,526 --> 00:08:24,787
My name is Kristen Bartlett.

93
00:08:24,967 --> 00:08:28,851
I currently reside at 488 Riverside Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts.

94
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:32,013
So I live right across the street from the project.

95
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:35,937
I'm a little bit concerned about a few different aspects.

96
00:08:37,118 --> 00:08:43,464
Of course, with the stop and shop being there and a few other, you know, real retail, excuse me, spaces.

97
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:51,785
It does get quite noisy, and we do encounter a lot of traffic getting in and out of our driveway, parking on the street.

98
00:08:52,886 --> 00:08:54,848
My house is usually blocked off.

99
00:08:54,908 --> 00:09:06,339
I'm usually asking someone at least once or twice a week, and I keep normal business hours for work to move their vehicle so that I can park in front of my house and not have to walk a block or so with my four-year-old.

100
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:21,041
I really oppose having an exit for this establishment on Riverside Avenue just due to the traffic that we do encounter with the exit just about a block or so up from our home.

101
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:26,646
It's very difficult to turn in and out, very difficult to get onto the street.

102
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:33,752
The infrastructure I don't think really supports making a drive-through establishment right there.

103
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:38,673
people aren't paying attention when they come in and out, so it's a little bit difficult.

104
00:09:40,315 --> 00:09:53,528
Also, and I guess, again, I don't know whether this has been established or not, the hours for this, with the Dunkin' Donuts being at that set of lights, it's hard enough to get past the McGlynn School to get to the highway on a daily basis.

105
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:03,171
So you are not in favor?

106
00:10:03,451 --> 00:10:03,631
No.

107
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:04,772
Thank you very much.

108
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:08,194
Anybody else not in favor of this project?

109
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,216
Not in favor of this project?

110
00:10:12,276 --> 00:10:15,598
Seeing and hearing none, I now close that portion of the public hearing.

111
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:19,461
And are we waiting for the attorney or are you proceeding?

112
00:10:21,098 --> 00:10:24,479
I know your attorney wanted to wait until the 23rd.

113
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,960
We would like to wait for the 23rd.

114
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,380
Thank you.

115
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,320
Mr. President.

116
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,321
Well, the attorney wants to be here to answer the questions.

117
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:30,921
Mr. President.

118
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:33,102
It's the will of the council, whatever the council wants.

119
00:10:33,602 --> 00:10:34,522
Councilor DelaRusso.

120
00:10:34,862 --> 00:10:45,206
I'd recommend that in the absence of their legal counsel and representation that we defer this till that time in which it can be.

121
00:10:45,586 --> 00:10:46,566
So I motion to table.

122
00:10:47,006 --> 00:10:48,967
On the motion for table, which is undebatable,

123
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:50,920
All those in favor?

124
00:10:55,882 --> 00:10:58,183
Well, the attorney asked, and they have legal representation.

125
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:03,886
There's a motion to table on the floor.

126
00:11:03,946 --> 00:11:04,826
The clerk will call the roll.

127
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:13,710
And till end, the motion is till the 23rd.

128
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,750
Is that correct or not?

129
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,774
Was that the data indicated by council?

130
00:11:17,814 --> 00:11:19,294
I received a message from him today.

131
00:11:19,354 --> 00:11:19,534
Yes.

132
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:25,737
He asked that consideration be made and I don't see any, I know there was a very interesting group of neighbors.

133
00:11:25,757 --> 00:11:29,198
There's a motion to table, so I don't want to cut you off, councilor, but there's a motion to table.

134
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:30,378
Thank you, Mr. President.

135
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:31,058
On my motion.

136
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:33,179
On Councilor De La Russo's motion.

137
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:34,039
Yes.

138
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,060
Clerk, we'll call the roll.

139
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,861
Vice President Caviello.

140
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:38,161
Yes.

141
00:11:39,221 --> 00:11:40,121
Councilor De La Russo.

142
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:40,661
Yes.

143
00:11:41,122 --> 00:11:41,662
Councilor Knight.

144
00:11:41,762 --> 00:11:41,982
Yes.

145
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:43,002
Councilor McCurry.

146
00:11:43,022 --> 00:11:43,102
No.

147
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:45,083
Councilor Marks.

148
00:11:48,615 --> 00:11:48,875
Yes.

149
00:11:48,955 --> 00:11:51,938
By a motion of four in the affirmative, two in the negative and one absent.

150
00:11:52,038 --> 00:11:55,641
The motion is tabled in father viewing public in the neighbors.

151
00:11:56,142 --> 00:12:05,131
Uh, this will be back before the Medford city council on December 23rd to, uh, take action or, um, discuss it in depth at that point.

152
00:12:05,611 --> 00:12:08,894
And, uh, we wish that your attorney is feeling better.

153
00:12:09,054 --> 00:12:09,455
Thank you.

154
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:15,787
In the motion, I revert back to the regular order of business.

155
00:12:15,847 --> 00:12:16,528
All those in favor?

156
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:17,008
Aye.

157
00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:18,029
All those opposed?

158
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:20,710
Item 14-732.

159
00:12:21,571 --> 00:12:22,251
Tax hearing.

160
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:23,932
Legal notice.

161
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:25,013
Notice of public hearing.

162
00:12:25,853 --> 00:12:26,814
City of Medford.

163
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:35,119

170
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,716
TDD 781-393-2516.

171
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:15,681
The city of Medford is an EEO AA504 employer.

172
00:13:16,182 --> 00:13:21,146
By order of the Medford City Council, signed Edward P. Finn, City Clerk, the public hearing is now open.

173
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:24,328
Name and address for the record.

174
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:28,992
Thank you, Mr. President.

175
00:13:30,904 --> 00:13:36,205
Ed O'Neill, Chairman of the Board of Assessors, Chief Assessor, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford.

176
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:49,328
As Chairman of the Board of Assessors, I am respectfully appearing before your honorable body tonight for the purpose of holding a public hearing to discuss the following items concerning the allocation of the fiscal year 2015 property tax.

177
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:53,229
One, to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2015.

178
00:13:55,633 --> 00:14:05,578
by selecting the minimum residential factor, a percentage of the total tax levy from the residential taxpayer to the commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

179
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:13,603
This results in a lower tax rate for residential properties and a higher tax rate for commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers.

180
00:14:14,183 --> 00:14:17,225
Historically, the council has chosen the minimum residential factor.

181
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:23,348
If this is once again the council choice, the minimum residential factor is decimal point 899216.

182
00:14:25,775 --> 00:14:27,796
Two, to adopt an open space discount.

183
00:14:28,336 --> 00:14:31,358
This does not apply in the city of Medford, but a no vote is required.

184
00:14:31,918 --> 00:14:34,139
Number three, to adopt a residential exemption.

185
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:40,863
If adopted, owner-occupied residential properties may receive an exemption of up to 20% of the average residential value.

186
00:14:41,343 --> 00:14:48,307
This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the tax levy from the owner-occupied residential properties to non-owner-occupied properties.

187
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:54,930
Since this shift causes a higher residential tax rate, a number of owner-occupied properties would also see an increase

188
00:14:55,388 --> 00:14:56,649
in their tax bills.

189
00:14:57,369 --> 00:14:59,611
Four, to adopt a small commercial exemption.

190
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:10,057
If adopted, commercial properties housing a business employing 10 or less people and valued at less than a million dollars may receive an exemption of up to 10% of assessed value.

191
00:15:10,555 --> 00:15:19,037
This is accomplished by shifting a portion of the commercial industrial tax levy from these eligible properties to another commercial and or industrial properties.

192
00:15:19,638 --> 00:15:28,600
Since this shift causes a higher commercial industrial tax rate, all commercial industrial not receiving the exemption would see an increase in their tax bills.

193
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,642
As part of this hearing, it is the duty of the board of assessors to notify the council of any excess levy capacity.

194
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:38,605
Fiscal year 2015, excess levy capacity is $57,657.67.

195
00:15:38,826 --> 00:15:45,831
Table of contents.

196
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:50,794
Page one is the classification hearing and the residential factor.

197
00:15:52,595 --> 00:15:57,039
In accordance with the Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 369 of the Acts of 1982, Chapter 797 of the Acts of 1979 Classification Amendment,

198
00:16:02,216 --> 00:16:08,799
The city council will hold a public hearing to receive public input relative to the determination of the residential factor for fiscal year 2015.

199
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:17,722
Under Massachusetts general laws, cities and towns are allowed to allocate or shift the tax burden between the various classes of property.

200
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:24,085
The residential factor determines the allocation of the real and personal property burden to shift between various classes of property.

201
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:30,768
By selecting a residential factor, you will also be deciding the respective tax rates for the real and personal property classes.

202
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:40,050
The Department of Revenue has authorized the adoption of two rates, one for residential and open space classes, and one for commercial, industrial, and personal property classes.

203
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:44,074
Page two is the tax levy limitation.

204
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,076
Last year, fiscal 2014, the levy limit was 93,175,009.

205
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:53,907
This year, that's a starting point for fiscal year 2015.

206
00:16:54,087 --> 00:16:55,608
The addition of 2.5% is $2,329,375.

207
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,711
Fiscal 2015 new growth is $999,941 for a total of $96,504,325 is the 2015 levy limit.

208
00:16:58,731 --> 00:17:01,233
Page three is the minimum residential factor computation.

209
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:02,253
It shows the breakdown of the

210
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:30,062
Percentage by class, residential class comprises of 88%, 1539% of the city, and the commercial industrial personal property is 11%, 11.8461%.

211
00:17:30,122 --> 00:17:33,823
Go through the calculations, you come up with a minimum residential factor of 93.281.

212
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:38,125
Page four is the calculation of the lowest possible residential factor.

213
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:49,174
The last year's chosen residential percentage was 78.1091%.

214
00:17:49,294 --> 00:17:53,657
Using a 150 shift would be 93.2810 with the minimum residential share, but the 150 shift is 82.2308%.

215
00:17:53,777 --> 00:17:56,258
To calculate the residential factor using a 175% shift to CIP, it's 89.9215%.

216
00:17:56,298 --> 00:17:58,480
Multiply that by the residential factor,

217
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:27,830
of the full and fair cash value residential percentage is 79.2693%, the lowest historical residential percentage since its first ratification, I believe it was 1980, 72.1010%.

218
00:18:31,873 --> 00:18:36,297
Page five is the classification options, starting with the single,

219
00:18:37,293 --> 00:18:42,035
A single tax rate based on the values in the levy of $13 and one cent.

220
00:18:42,195 --> 00:18:56,060
That will be a factor of 1.00 and that will be for all classes of property going all the way down the matrix to the max at 175% which would give it projected as $11 and 70 cents for residential and 22.77 for CIP.

221
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,280
Page six.

222
00:19:05,046 --> 00:19:06,947
is the LA-4, which is the valuation.

223
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:17,491
Department of Revenue LA-4 form, breaking down by class of property on the left-hand side, number of parcels, and the total value for this fiscal year.

224
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,913
Page seven is the valuation summary.

225
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:30,256
Fiscal year 2005, the total value of the city from last year to this year went up 9.36%.

226
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:36,825
Next page is the breakdown by class.

227
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:45,892
Single families went up 8%, condominiums went up 10%, two families went up 13%, three families went up 14%.

228
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:50,896
The twos and threes went up the most of this fiscal year.

229
00:19:51,397 --> 00:19:56,821
It reflects the mirror of 2004 values when the market went through the roof.

230
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:03,770
Apartments, small apartments, 48% and the larger complexes went up 18%.

231
00:20:04,571 --> 00:20:06,532
Commercial, 3% and industrial at 4%.

232
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:11,374
Page eight is a new growth.

233
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:14,296
New growth is part of the levy limit.

234
00:20:15,196 --> 00:20:17,457
New growth was certified today at 999,941.

235
00:20:17,777 --> 00:20:22,220
Page nine is the scenario.

236
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,862
If you use the minimum residential factor,

237
00:20:27,552 --> 00:20:29,934
what the average increase in value would be.

238
00:20:30,734 --> 00:20:34,096
Average increase for a single family would be $394,500.

239
00:20:34,136 --> 00:20:35,477
The average condominium is $294,600.

240
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:37,238
The average two family is $458,000.

241
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:39,240
The average three family is $545,900.

242
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,601
The average commercial industrial is $1,098,400.

243
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:44,903
So if the council adopted the minimum residential factor,

244
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:57,899
The average increase for a single family would be $128.47.

245
00:20:58,399 --> 00:21:02,461
The average for a condominium would be $105.02.

246
00:21:02,801 --> 00:21:07,183
And the average of a two-family would be $3.74.08.

247
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:10,765
Two-family.

248
00:21:10,885 --> 00:21:12,106
Average three-family would be $5.13.16.

249
00:21:12,606 --> 00:21:17,308
And the average commercial industrial would only see an increase of $2.90 to $2.27.

250
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:24,572
So again, the increase would be in the twos and three-families based on the valuation increases.

251
00:21:26,716 --> 00:21:39,443
Page 9-1 is the scenario for a single tax rate and the possible increases to the residential class versus the commercial class.

252
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:46,527
Page 10 is the fiscal year 2015 tax rates from surrounding cities and towns.

253
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,388
There aren't many in yet.

254
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:49,848
It's probably two-thirds.

255
00:21:50,869 --> 00:21:56,612
Once again, Bedford, as proposed, would be around the third or fourth lowest residential tax rate.

256
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:18,127
If the council adopts that page 11 is page one, two, three, four of the recap and page 12 would be the residential exemption applies to all residential owner occupied properties, non owner occupy occupied properties would be excluded.

257
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:25,913
This means any real property used for residential purposes, um, including apartment buildings in which the owner does not have a permanent residency address.

258
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:33,044
Lots adjacent to and owned by owner-occupied real property would also be excluded.

259
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:38,148
The residential exemption is a class exemption to the residential portion of the tax base only.

260
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:44,012
It does not have anything to do with various social economic status of a taxpayer.

261
00:22:44,052 --> 00:22:46,714
It's based on the fair cash value of real property in the city.

262
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:52,439
Fiscal year 2015 assessments based on January 1, 2014 assessment date.

263
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,320
With this information in mind,

264
00:22:55,049 --> 00:23:12,414
We must be aware that all, uh, all owner occupied properties with the total assessed value of four, four, five, 46, 400 and above will be the recipient of the exemption if it's owner occupied, but because of the higher tax rate involved will actually pay more in taxes than they would without the exemption.

265
00:23:13,295 --> 00:23:17,496
The local option in the residential exemption must either be approved or disapproved by a council vote.

266
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:20,417
The percentage allowable by law is anywhere up to 10 to 20%.

267
00:23:22,043 --> 00:23:26,246
Communities that receive special legislation can exceed the 20% maximum.

268
00:23:27,306 --> 00:23:37,913
If the resident owner for any reason is not granted the exemption and can prove honor occupancy on January 1, 2014, an application must be timely filed and an approved exemption will be granted.

269
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:40,955
These funds are deducted from the overlay reserves.

270
00:23:41,936 --> 00:23:47,259
Affiliates who file it properly and timely will result in the denial of any and all exemptions.

271
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,482
Next page is the Department of Revenue breakdown.

272
00:23:52,178 --> 00:23:55,359
for the residential, to explain the residential exemption.

273
00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:04,081
A municipality can grant a residential exemption of a dollar amount that cannot exceed 20% of the average assessed value on our residential class properties.

274
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:09,602
Communities that receive special legislation can exceed the 20% maximum.

275
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:19,785
The exemption reduces by the adopted percentage, the taxable valuation of each residential parcel that is a taxpayer's principal residence.

276
00:24:20,532 --> 00:24:30,259
Granting the exemption raises the residential tax rate and shifts the residential burden from moderately or lower valued homes to apartments, summer homes and higher valued homes.

277
00:24:30,879 --> 00:24:37,384
A residential exemption is one way resort areas, Cape Cod and the Berkshires can provide some tax relief for permanent residents.

278
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:43,068
Next page is the number of communities that have adopted it.

279
00:24:48,452 --> 00:24:48,992
13 communities.

280
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:50,938
We have adopted it so far.

281
00:24:51,998 --> 00:24:53,299
The next page is the impact.

282
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,802
If it was adopted at 20%, 15%, and 10%, the valuation reduction for 20% would be 80,379.

283
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:57,322
For 15% would be 60,284.

284
00:24:57,402 --> 00:24:58,563
For 10% would be 40,189.

285
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:18,906
And the important part to note here, as I stated earlier, was the 546, 400, 543, 800, 546, 300 would be the cutoff.

286
00:25:18,926 --> 00:25:24,328
So anybody paying more than that would, assessed more than that would be paying more in taxes if owner-occupied.

287
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:31,511
There would be 1,278 parcels that would pay more as owner-occupied for 20%, for 15% would be 13, 18, for 10% would be 12, 79 would pay more in taxes.

288
00:25:39,051 --> 00:25:54,394
Next page is the breakdown, uh, the actual formula and calculation to see what a number of owner occupied properties to date that we have on file is 12,032 and the various scenarios, um, the dollar and tax dollar amounts by 20, 15, and 10%.

289
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:59,815
Next page is the residential exemption breakdown.

290
00:25:59,835 --> 00:26:01,916
Uh, we have 15,259 residential properties.

291
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:10,678
74%, 12,032 are owner occupied.

292
00:26:11,378 --> 00:26:16,800
We have a number of trusts that we could not ascertain ownership, 882.

293
00:26:17,381 --> 00:26:20,342
We have 268 unknown owner occupied.

294
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:26,705
We have 2,309 non-owner occupied, and that's an estimated number.

295
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:30,187
And then residential land and accessory parcels are not included, 768.

296
00:26:31,597 --> 00:26:34,759
for a total of 16 to 59 in the residential class.

297
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,421
Next page is a small commercial exemption.

298
00:26:38,322 --> 00:26:42,224
The various scenarios adopting yet with no exemption, 1%, 5%, 10%.

299
00:26:43,245 --> 00:26:52,692
Chair recognizes Councilor Lungo-Kern and then Councilor Knight.

300
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:56,134
I do have some questions, thanks.

301
00:26:56,561 --> 00:26:57,461
Thank you.

302
00:26:57,501 --> 00:26:58,501
Do you want to wait, Councillor?

303
00:26:58,521 --> 00:26:59,342
Your light was on.

304
00:26:59,382 --> 00:27:00,002
Do you want to wait?

305
00:27:00,242 --> 00:27:00,582
No, no.

306
00:27:00,682 --> 00:27:01,782
I can ask a few questions.

307
00:27:02,182 --> 00:27:05,823
Thank you for the— Point of information, Councillor Dela Ruccio.

308
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:21,065
Just in the interest of public safety, the ceiling on the west side of this room is leaking, and I'd urge people not to stand on that side of the room, as it appears from this angle that a patched portion of the ceiling is beginning to sag and may give way.

309
00:27:22,466 --> 00:27:23,706
Can you step away from that, sir?

310
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,593
Sorry to disturb, Councilor.

311
00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:30,554
Thank you, Councilor.

312
00:27:30,574 --> 00:27:33,335
Councilor Longo-Kerr, as everyone looks up for the sale of the book.

313
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:34,635
Just checking it out, OK.

314
00:27:36,076 --> 00:27:37,616
Thank you, President Camuso.

315
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:41,137
Thank you, Ed, for the brief summary.

316
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:49,280
The local receipts not allocated, the recap, I'm not sure we went over this in detail in our subcommittee meeting.

317
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,160
Can we just go over a few of the figures on that?

318
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:52,041
Sure.

319
00:27:53,481 --> 00:27:56,282
I'd probably have to defer to Finance Director Baker on that.

320
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:56,622
OK.

321
00:27:58,712 --> 00:28:06,954
The first would be the $300,000 difference from the penalties and interest on taxes and excises from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015.

322
00:28:06,994 --> 00:28:12,356
Anne, could you address that?

323
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:16,057
Estimated receipts.

324
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:23,119
Name and address for the record.

325
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:25,419
Can we just get your name and title?

326
00:28:25,499 --> 00:28:27,400
Anne Baker, the finance director of the city of Medford.

327
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:29,278
I didn't hear what you said.

328
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:30,719
What item were you questioning?

329
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:35,660
The page before is marked as 11, so it would be like 11B, I guess.

330
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,881
Yeah, what item?

331
00:28:38,921 --> 00:28:41,261
Penalties and interest on taxes and excises.

332
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:46,702
Yes, that's because there was a particularly large tax title parcel came in last year.

333
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:50,743
I think the interest on it was over $300,000.

334
00:28:51,143 --> 00:28:56,685
I don't remember the actual property address that it was, but that won't be repeated.

335
00:28:58,162 --> 00:29:00,003
So it was a large new build?

336
00:29:00,023 --> 00:29:05,785
It was a large tax title property, a large property that had been in tax title for a number of years that was redeemed.

337
00:29:11,008 --> 00:29:16,390
And then the next one, payment in lieu of taxes, how come that is increased?

338
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:17,591
Right.

339
00:29:17,651 --> 00:29:25,855
The MVDC payment that was supposed to come in that was a new payment for fiscal 14 did not come in until fiscal 15.

340
00:29:27,052 --> 00:29:29,153
So that will be budgeted for fiscal 15.

341
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:30,514
That was $166,000.

342
00:29:30,954 --> 00:29:34,896
Then we will get that same amount that is due for fiscal 15, which is $166,000.

343
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:38,838
And then there's a new payment due for fiscal 15 of another $107,000.

344
00:29:39,058 --> 00:29:47,982
And then number 10, fees.

345
00:29:49,243 --> 00:29:50,544
Another significant difference.

346
00:29:52,885 --> 00:29:53,525
Number 10, the fees.

347
00:29:53,545 --> 00:29:56,227
That has to do with the cable fees.

348
00:29:58,768 --> 00:30:06,512
We get about $400,000 a year from Comcast, and we get about $200,000 a year from Verizon.

349
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:09,674
So that'll be the $600,000 budgeted for fiscal 15.

350
00:30:10,154 --> 00:30:13,315
And the last year, sometimes their payments go into the wrong year.

351
00:30:13,335 --> 00:30:15,236
If they're late, they go into the wrong year.

352
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:18,138
So last year, one of the payments went into the wrong year, went into the previous year.

353
00:30:18,678 --> 00:30:19,699
So it was lower last year.

354
00:30:20,039 --> 00:30:22,220
So that's the fee that's supposed to be used for

355
00:30:22,753 --> 00:30:24,694
the three public TV stations?

356
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:25,875
Yeah, right.

357
00:30:26,015 --> 00:30:27,696
No, no, no, these aren't the TV3.

358
00:30:27,716 --> 00:30:29,517
These are the fees that come into the city.

359
00:30:30,317 --> 00:30:32,338
The franchise fee, the 3% franchise fee.

360
00:30:36,921 --> 00:30:39,482
That's a separate fee from what we usually use for TV3?

361
00:30:39,522 --> 00:30:40,863
That's a separate fee?

362
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:43,765
Right, it's a separate fee, right.

363
00:30:43,865 --> 00:30:49,228
So 3%- That fee is now being kept in a separate fund when the TV3 issue is resolved, I guess.

364
00:30:50,193 --> 00:30:53,295
So but that separate fee is coming out at three percent.

365
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:59,580
It's just held separately No, that does it three as a three percent fee that we get for the franchise fee is a local receipt.

366
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:15,170
It's always been a local receipt Point of information counselor Penta and there's two separate accounts One that has a public access account that it has in excess of three hundred thousand dollars That's the that's the TV field TV three money, right?

367
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:16,011
And there's another account

368
00:31:17,995 --> 00:31:20,637
where Verizon and Comcast pay a percentage.

369
00:31:20,897 --> 00:31:21,938
Right, and that's this account here.

370
00:31:21,958 --> 00:31:22,559
That's this account here.

371
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:23,379
Verizon and Comcast.

372
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:25,741
Okay, so they are two separate accounts.

373
00:31:25,781 --> 00:31:25,941
Right.

374
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:26,442
They're not one.

375
00:31:27,923 --> 00:31:32,767
Gotcha, okay, and then number 16, departmental revenue.

376
00:31:33,107 --> 00:31:38,972
That is, the excess on that is the guaranteed portion of the new parking fees.

377
00:31:40,293 --> 00:31:43,535
We're guaranteed to get at least six months worth of a $25,000 per month fee in this coming year.

378
00:31:49,709 --> 00:31:50,850
regardless of what else happens.

379
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:56,157
So we've put in that guaranteed fee as an additional excess departmental revenue.

380
00:31:56,897 --> 00:31:59,861
And then number 23, miscellaneous, non-recurring.

381
00:32:00,602 --> 00:32:04,146
The 23, that was FEMA money from the prior year.

382
00:32:04,186 --> 00:32:04,847
That won't repeat.

383
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:07,083
That was for potholes?

384
00:32:08,344 --> 00:32:10,345
I can't remember.

385
00:32:10,365 --> 00:32:10,526
FEMA?

386
00:32:10,546 --> 00:32:11,426
I think it was FEMA.

387
00:32:12,147 --> 00:32:13,228
That was the floods.

388
00:32:13,868 --> 00:32:14,449
The floods, yeah.

389
00:32:14,469 --> 00:32:16,030
We got money back from FEMA a few years ago.

390
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,151
Yeah, I can't remember what that was.

391
00:32:18,172 --> 00:32:18,992
It was from FEMA.

392
00:32:23,656 --> 00:32:30,001
And then we had mentioned in subcommittee that free cash for 2000, the last fiscal year,

393
00:32:31,867 --> 00:32:34,148
was about, we put a million dollars into free cash.

394
00:32:34,168 --> 00:32:35,148
Slightly less than a million.

395
00:32:35,408 --> 00:32:45,350
But that was almost all attributable, a large portion of that was attributable to the excess amount collected from motor vehicle excise in excess of what was budgeted.

396
00:32:46,571 --> 00:32:50,652
I think 700,000 of that was because of that one item.

397
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:53,892
Motor vehicle excise number one.

398
00:32:53,912 --> 00:32:55,833
What was budgeted for 14 and what was collected in 14.

399
00:32:57,348 --> 00:32:58,389
You don't have that in front of you?

400
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:02,112
Well, we have number one, motor vehicle excise for $5,682,440.

401
00:33:02,492 --> 00:33:02,792
Right.

402
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:15,322
So what was collected in 14 was significantly over what was budgeted in 14, which is what attributed that a large portion of that increase in free cash was attributable to that.

403
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,317
So we don't expect that increase in 2015?

404
00:33:17,418 --> 00:33:19,640
No, I think it's stable.

405
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,560
Well, we can't tell.

406
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:30,469
We really can only budget what we collected in the previous year unless we have evidence that it's going to be repeated.

407
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:32,031
That was kind of.

408
00:33:32,191 --> 00:33:35,174
And what was the figure again that it went over budget?

409
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:39,978
I think it was more than half, like $600,000 maybe.

410
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:41,700
I'd have to go back and get that last year's recap.

411
00:33:45,363 --> 00:34:06,261
If I may put a motion through the chair, could we get figures by next week on how much was put into free cash in 2012, 2013, and how much has been put into free cash so far in 2000?

412
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,523
Oh, I guess you wouldn't do that until the end of 2000.

413
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:09,744
You don't do that until the end of the year.

414
00:34:09,764 --> 00:34:12,986
So just the last certification of free cash was as of June 30, 2014.

415
00:34:14,413 --> 00:34:15,874
So it would have been the results of operations.

416
00:34:16,174 --> 00:34:22,800
So can you give me the last three, 2011, 2012, 2013, June figures for what was put into free cash?

417
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,121
Can we get a copy of that?

418
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:25,702
Sure.

419
00:34:25,722 --> 00:34:27,683
Do you have that, Mr. Clerk?

420
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:34,689
And so the last year, the majority, I guess, came from motor vehicle excise.

421
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:35,810
A large portion of it, yeah.

422
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,212
And where did the additional?

423
00:34:38,432 --> 00:34:39,573
Do you have any idea?

424
00:34:39,633 --> 00:34:43,376
There was only a couple of hundred thousand dollars in unspent budgets.

425
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,361
to the best of my recollection, that's right.

426
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:59,167
The rest of it was all, the rest of it was, you know, minor items and other line items of local receipts, but those were the two major items.

427
00:34:59,747 --> 00:35:02,069
It doesn't make me too much, because the excise revenue.

428
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:03,430
I'm good for questions right now.

429
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:04,831
Thank you.

430
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:07,172
I have nothing to add, Councilor.

431
00:35:07,212 --> 00:35:08,233
The microphone was on, but.

432
00:35:10,334 --> 00:35:11,815
Councilor Penta.

433
00:35:12,836 --> 00:35:13,497
Maybe I missed it.

434
00:35:13,757 --> 00:35:14,877
Can we go back to number 10?

435
00:35:14,998 --> 00:35:15,438
Where's Anne?

436
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:16,839
Number 10.

437
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:21,539
under fees, it went from 398 to 609?

438
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:21,839
Right.

439
00:35:25,602 --> 00:35:36,590
Because something in the previous year, one of the items was posted in the wrong year, it was posted, it was like, sometimes they send in one check, and it's for two payments, and it went into the previous year.

440
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:39,272
So the 609 is what we would normally get every year.

441
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:44,255
We get about 400,000 from Comcast, and about 200,000 from Verizon.

442
00:35:46,877 --> 00:35:47,778
So let me get that straight.

443
00:35:49,328 --> 00:35:52,170
If in fiscal 2014, you had 398.

444
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,630
Right.

445
00:35:54,791 --> 00:36:00,314
Because something from Comcast got paid early.

446
00:36:00,514 --> 00:36:03,995
They paid us with one check right at the end of the year, and it got posted into the prior year.

447
00:36:05,296 --> 00:36:07,157
So then that got posted, what, in 2013?

448
00:36:07,357 --> 00:36:10,919
Yeah.

449
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,400
On the same train of thought, can we get, for the years 11, 12, and 13,

450
00:36:18,873 --> 00:36:21,254
Comcast what they paid and what Verizon paid.

451
00:36:21,274 --> 00:36:23,535
Do you have that, Eddie?

452
00:36:23,555 --> 00:36:25,536
11, 12, and 13 fiscal years.

453
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:34,920
They tend to pay them right smack at the end of the year, so sometimes they get into the line, yeah.

454
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,502
Now, it looks like, and this is like, these numbers are really tight.

455
00:36:39,522 --> 00:36:43,223
When you talk about Medicaid reimbursement, you're talking about less than $60,000?

456
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:51,151
You go from 446, 628 to 447.

457
00:36:51,351 --> 00:36:53,011
That's just rounding.

458
00:36:53,031 --> 00:36:54,112
We're assuming the same number.

459
00:36:54,132 --> 00:36:57,132
We have no reason to suspect that it's going to be any higher.

460
00:36:57,493 --> 00:36:59,253
We work with Shore Collaborative.

461
00:36:59,753 --> 00:37:07,976
And Shore Collaborative generally gives us an estimate if they think there's something, if the federal government has changed their formula, or if they think we're going to get more money for some reason.

462
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:13,057
Generally, it's because the federal government changed their formula, or something's timing has changed.

463
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,138
But we've had no information from Shore to indicate that.

464
00:37:16,929 --> 00:37:21,292
anything extraordinary is gonna come in at 15, over and above what came in at 14.

465
00:37:22,093 --> 00:37:24,915
And also under 23, which is miscellaneous.

466
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:25,916
What number?

467
00:37:26,356 --> 00:37:26,856
Number 23.

468
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:28,217
Yeah, that was FEMA.

469
00:37:29,158 --> 00:37:31,560
That was FEMA money that came in at 14 that won't come in at 15.

470
00:37:33,081 --> 00:37:37,124
So all our prior debt for last year's snowstorms and everything have been paid?

471
00:37:37,344 --> 00:37:37,864
That's right, yeah.

472
00:37:39,185 --> 00:37:39,425
Okay.

473
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:42,528
Can we just go back?

474
00:37:45,273 --> 00:37:49,055
Go back to that number 10, where you have Comcast and Verizon, and you have fees.

475
00:37:49,636 --> 00:37:50,977
We're going to get them for 11, 12, and 13.

476
00:37:51,277 --> 00:38:00,883
And can you also give us the amount of money that was paid by the city of Medford to Channel 3 during those years, too?

477
00:38:01,263 --> 00:38:03,444
Because I believe they have all the checks.

478
00:38:03,524 --> 00:38:04,505
What was paid to them?

479
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:06,867
Yeah, to the Medford Community Cable Access.

480
00:38:07,427 --> 00:38:08,748
Well, we've been holding all those checks.

481
00:38:08,768 --> 00:38:10,329
No, no, you're holding it, I believe,

482
00:38:11,139 --> 00:38:11,599
December of 2012.

483
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:19,226
So all of 11 and mostly all of 12, you wrote checks, the city wrote checks.

484
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:21,247
So you want to know what we paid to them during fiscal 11?

485
00:38:21,968 --> 00:38:22,408
11 and 12.

486
00:38:22,828 --> 00:38:23,729
Fiscal 11 and 12, okay.

487
00:38:23,749 --> 00:38:24,430
And then it stopped.

488
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,451
I think, didn't we go over this one time before?

489
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:27,332
No, we never got that.

490
00:38:27,852 --> 00:38:31,836
No, you gave us how much is sitting in the account, but I want to know what was paid.

491
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:32,596
Okay.

492
00:38:32,616 --> 00:38:33,497
In other words, during the month of 2011,

493
00:38:35,123 --> 00:38:39,925
Fiscal 2011, fiscal 12, how much was given to TV3, or whatever they were called at that time.

494
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:40,285
All right.

495
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,386
You have that, Eddie?

496
00:38:42,426 --> 00:38:44,367
Yeah, we got it.

497
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:46,367
OK.

498
00:38:47,188 --> 00:38:47,908
Any other councilors?

499
00:38:47,948 --> 00:38:48,448
Any questions?

500
00:38:51,669 --> 00:38:52,650
Councilor Lungo-Kern.

501
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,471
Thank you, President Camuso.

502
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,071
The new growth, the 999,941,

503
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:07,629
What was the dollar amount on that new development, the Lumiere apartments?

504
00:39:08,189 --> 00:39:10,511
I mean, that had to be a large chunk of that?

505
00:39:13,073 --> 00:39:19,577
Well, for you, Mr. President, the property is under construction.

506
00:39:19,637 --> 00:39:22,019
So we pick up a part of the value this year.

507
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:24,060
We get to pick up most of it for next year.

508
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,763
I know they were occupied as of, I guess, August 2014.

509
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:29,804
So that would be in the apartment growth.

510
00:39:32,521 --> 00:39:36,845
That would be the fourth, one, two, three, fourth line down on the second page.

511
00:39:37,225 --> 00:39:38,026
That's part of that.

512
00:39:38,046 --> 00:39:40,688
What page are you on?

513
00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:42,409
New growth form.

514
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,451
Page eight.

515
00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:45,011
Eight.

516
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:47,213
The back page of it.

517
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:58,602
So that would be...

518
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,541
Which section would that be, Ed?

519
00:40:09,582 --> 00:40:14,365
That would be captured under multi-families.

520
00:40:15,786 --> 00:40:16,967
That would be the last column.

521
00:40:19,249 --> 00:40:20,370
New growth valuation?

522
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:20,990
Yeah.

523
00:40:21,511 --> 00:40:23,912
It's part of that $7 million.

524
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:24,573
Oh, gotcha.

525
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:27,395
We'll capture most of that next year.

526
00:40:29,717 --> 00:40:35,301
And will we capture the new development at Station Landing Hotel?

527
00:40:36,141 --> 00:40:36,822
Will that be next year?

528
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:42,831
That's the front parcel, that's for the hotel, yeah, we will.

529
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:51,373
There's nothing done yet on that, just a change in the... No, I think it was actually commercial land before, so no, nothing yet.

530
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:52,814
Not until they put the shovel in the ground.

531
00:40:53,614 --> 00:40:54,614
So it'll be next year.

532
00:40:55,234 --> 00:40:57,335
Next year, yeah.

533
00:40:57,475 --> 00:40:59,095
Are there any other large developments?

534
00:40:59,475 --> 00:41:06,017
Yep, there's Middlesex Avenue, the apartment complex behind Wendy's, they're in the ground on that one.

535
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:13,584
Is Rivers Edge going to put another apartment building on the front parcel there?

536
00:41:14,024 --> 00:41:14,625
Is it two now?

537
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:15,886
Is it two?

538
00:41:16,486 --> 00:41:16,726
Okay.

539
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:23,450
So there's a lot of activity in the apartment sector of real estate, not just in Medford, but all over.

540
00:41:25,792 --> 00:41:29,754
Rents have gone up, especially in those higher end apartment complexes.

541
00:41:31,436 --> 00:41:32,616
Thank you.

542
00:41:37,068 --> 00:41:40,310
Also on Locust Street, Lumineer, they should be coming on board too.

543
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,891
That's the one we were just talking about, yeah.

544
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:46,433
Locust and Middlesex, 3780 Mystic Valley Parkway.

545
00:41:46,453 --> 00:41:46,573
Right.

546
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:47,074
Yeah.

547
00:41:47,554 --> 00:42:00,241
So you get Lumineer, and then you're going to have the one at opposite station, standing where Mellon Bank is, and then you're going to have one further down in front of where the medical building is, and then, where's the fourth one?

548
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:03,423
River's Edge, Middlesex Ave.

549
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:04,363
No, that's what I'm talking about.

550
00:42:04,423 --> 00:42:05,144
River's Edge will have

551
00:42:06,285 --> 00:42:06,685
River's edge.

552
00:42:06,705 --> 00:42:07,306
We'll have one.

553
00:42:07,346 --> 00:42:14,049
And then on the front in front of where Mellon bank is on the baseball field, there's another 230 units going to be in the back at one cab at road, right?

554
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:19,051
So you can have two 30, three 30, four, you can have almost 550 more new units.

555
00:42:19,131 --> 00:42:20,251
More than that.

556
00:42:20,451 --> 00:42:21,872
When they come online, right.

557
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:25,014
And higher end rents as well.

558
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:25,494
Right.

559
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:32,417
So there seems to be an incentive to build in Medford proximity location amenities.

560
00:42:33,272 --> 00:42:39,017
We'll see how long that lasts once the casino goes in, and what that does to the traffic, and to the Wellington area.

561
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:51,267
Mr. President, I'd just like to get back and, are we gonna stay on that page, or are we going on another?

562
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:52,448
Okay.

563
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:55,511
We'll all wait until we get to the very end.

564
00:42:55,811 --> 00:42:56,992
There might be other issues, I don't know.

565
00:42:58,913 --> 00:43:00,395
Any other questions, motions?

566
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,193
Councilor DelaRusso.

567
00:43:06,453 --> 00:43:07,894
Motion to approve Mr. President.

568
00:43:08,314 --> 00:43:11,316
This is a four part process.

569
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:16,500
Name and address for the record on the motion of approval by Councilor DelaRusso.

570
00:43:17,901 --> 00:43:20,543
If you could step aside and let the gentleman up here please.

571
00:43:23,065 --> 00:43:24,065
Thank you.

572
00:43:25,847 --> 00:43:28,649
Uh, my name is John Sorrello.

573
00:43:28,709 --> 00:43:31,811
I reside at 20 Metcalfe Street, Medford and uh,

574
00:43:33,131 --> 00:43:38,734
I want to say that the way this is presented here, this is an open hearing.

575
00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:41,336
And the people have to have input.

576
00:43:41,476 --> 00:43:43,277
And this should be thoroughly debated.

577
00:43:44,557 --> 00:43:54,723
Now, what happens here is that this paper put forth by the administration says, historically, the council has chosen a minimum residential factor.

578
00:43:55,503 --> 00:43:59,966
If this is, once again, the council choice, the minimum residential factor is almost 90%.

579
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:05,268
The administration shouldn't be telling you how to vote on this.

580
00:44:05,788 --> 00:44:08,070
I mean, I think you should debate this and then decide.

581
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:15,333
There are a whole range of factors here, beginning with the single factor, which is approximately 13 percent.

582
00:44:16,634 --> 00:44:18,715
I mean, yes, it's 13 percent.

583
00:44:19,775 --> 00:44:27,739
With the new factor put in, the rate will rise.

584
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:31,961
Now, the point I want to make is there is a difference between

585
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,121
a rate and a levy.

586
00:44:36,681 --> 00:44:41,884
I mean, the rate may be lower, but the levy is higher.

587
00:44:43,164 --> 00:44:45,266
And you should not confuse those two.

588
00:44:46,186 --> 00:45:00,073
Now, I want to ask the auditor, if we had had, over the last 28 years, if we had had a single factor, would the tax levy itself

589
00:45:01,846 --> 00:45:04,907
be higher or lower than it is now?

590
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:08,148
I wish one of them would answer that question.

591
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:25,472
As we've discussed in the past, the way the formula is constructed, when you do the

592
00:45:26,622 --> 00:45:36,244
residential factor shift, to shift the burden of the taxes from the residential payers to the commercial payers, it does result in a higher levy.

593
00:45:37,224 --> 00:45:46,447
However, it results in a lower tax bill for the residential owners as opposed to the commercial tax bill.

594
00:45:47,307 --> 00:45:52,608
And we went back last year, or the year before, we went back six years and determined that

595
00:45:53,183 --> 00:46:13,165
if we had had a single rate every year for those six years, at the end of that six year period, even though the levy was higher, in other words, the amount of taxes brought into the city from all sources, the levy is higher, the residents, not the single family, but the residents, as opposed to the commercial, the residential class,

596
00:46:13,703 --> 00:46:14,824
still would pay less.

597
00:46:15,624 --> 00:46:21,067
And he's trying to say, if we went back to 1988 and did it every year from 1988, would it still be lower?

598
00:46:21,567 --> 00:46:39,115
I haven't done that exercise, but I would be willing to bet that because we do a full 175% shift from the residential class to the commercial class, I don't believe that the residential taxpayer would ever recoup what they've saved over the years by having their residential shift.

599
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:42,017
And that is what this council has approved every year,

600
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:47,472
since 1988, they've approved it every year, because that's true.

601
00:46:48,113 --> 00:46:52,355
And we didn't go back to do it until 1988, but we went back six years, and it proved out true then.

602
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:58,218
And even in some of the years when the values were down, we were doing a 200% shift.

603
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:00,199
We did a 200% shift.

604
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:08,123
So I don't believe that the residential taxpayer would ever have recouped the savings that were granted through this shift in all those years.

605
00:47:11,785 --> 00:47:12,886
I'd like to respond to that.

606
00:47:14,685 --> 00:47:17,087
The tax levy last year was $93 million.

607
00:47:17,127 --> 00:47:21,329
Now, this year it's going to be $96.5 million.

608
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:24,531
There's an increase there of $3.5 million.

609
00:47:25,531 --> 00:47:34,596
On the other hand, if we had had the single tax rate from the beginning, well, we'd be paying $6 million less.

610
00:47:35,237 --> 00:47:36,737
The tax levy now would be $89 million.

611
00:47:42,533 --> 00:47:46,054
What happens is really that the people pay the tax levy.

612
00:47:46,975 --> 00:47:48,696
I mean, that's what they are actually paying.

613
00:47:49,316 --> 00:47:54,198
So what would happen really is that the payments would be less.

614
00:47:54,358 --> 00:47:56,739
I mean, taxes would still go up.

615
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:57,879
Don't misunderstand.

616
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,221
But they would go up much less if we had a single rate.

617
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:03,802
Now, Oregon has a single rate.

618
00:48:04,062 --> 00:48:05,382
Belmont has a single rate.

619
00:48:05,702 --> 00:48:06,283
They love it.

620
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,763
And they're prosperous.

621
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:12,245
Name and address for the record.

622
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:13,410
Good evening.

623
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:18,392
Joseph Villione, 59 Garfield Ave., Medford, Mass., and I want to thank Dr. Stirella.

624
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:20,893
There should be debate about a city budget.

625
00:48:21,193 --> 00:48:26,515
It shouldn't just come in here, go through the other, and then be rubber-stamped.

626
00:48:27,275 --> 00:48:32,397
Especially, I'm concerned about the $600,000 from the franchise fee.

627
00:48:33,038 --> 00:48:35,819
Now, the listening, viewing public needs to know

628
00:48:36,867 --> 00:48:45,614
In most cities and towns, the entire peg money, all 5%, goes to public access television, governmental television in high school.

629
00:48:46,535 --> 00:48:47,676
Where's the high school money?

630
00:48:48,477 --> 00:48:51,099
200 grand goes to TV3, the old TV3.

631
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,163
200 grand's supposed to go to the government channel, but it's used for three salaries at the high school.

632
00:48:57,204 --> 00:49:03,770
And then the 600 grand goes into a general fund, which the mayor does this, no one discusses it,

633
00:49:04,886 --> 00:49:09,248
And his own community access TV committee said, we need 500 grand to start a new station.

634
00:49:10,388 --> 00:49:16,531
Yet, if he's taken 600K, and we've lost access, that 600K this year should go to building a new station.

635
00:49:16,831 --> 00:49:18,631
This is a second tier tax.

636
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:20,152
I think that's the term they use.

637
00:49:20,852 --> 00:49:26,454
Let's just call it a second tax on the cable TV subscribers, who already pay the real estate tax.

638
00:49:26,815 --> 00:49:29,456
Now they're getting to pay another tax.

639
00:49:29,876 --> 00:49:31,756
This is another tax, and it's wrong.

640
00:49:32,077 --> 00:49:32,777
It's unfair.

641
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:42,221
And this council really needs to do something about it, because year after year after year, the mayor just takes that money, throws it in the general fund, and no one knows where it's coming from.

642
00:49:42,261 --> 00:49:44,261
Well, that's where it's coming from, your cable TV bill.

643
00:49:46,582 --> 00:49:48,163
On the motion of Councilor DelaRusso.

644
00:49:48,183 --> 00:49:48,323
May I?

645
00:49:49,343 --> 00:49:49,984
Oh, sure.

646
00:49:51,204 --> 00:49:52,405
Name and address for the record, sir.

647
00:49:52,585 --> 00:49:56,546
Andrew Castanetti, 23 Cushing Street, Medford, Mass.

648
00:49:57,807 --> 00:49:59,828
Excuse my hat, I'm a bit out of the weather.

649
00:50:03,163 --> 00:50:05,564
I'll make this very brief, even though I forgot my glasses.

650
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,848
Thank you, Councilor Dela Ruzzo.

651
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:22,273
First off, season greetings, and if I may, I wish you all a peaceful Christmas.

652
00:50:25,295 --> 00:50:28,536
We feel like this is deja vu all over again,

653
00:50:30,936 --> 00:50:47,385
will you please give the local owner-occupied homeowner at least a 20% real estate tax exemption, only if they live in their house, which can be verified by their income tax filing address.

654
00:50:49,828 --> 00:51:01,235
As you know, this real real estate tax savings is being done in Malden, Everett, Somerville, and it's at 35 percent in Somerville.

655
00:51:02,956 --> 00:51:03,636
Why not us?

656
00:51:05,918 --> 00:51:13,002
At least give us the 20 percent, which is automatic from the state of Massachusetts, if we adopt it.

657
00:51:15,904 --> 00:51:16,644
Especially when

658
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:40,627
12 of 13, over 90% of Medford homeowners would receive a lower real estate tax bill than last year's, versus historically a two to 4% yearly increase in real estate tax bill dollars.

659
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:48,651
I, we the people, are not politicians at this time, however,

660
00:51:50,437 --> 00:52:17,462
You, our elected city councilors, do have the power tonight to vote for a 20% real estate tax exemption and vote to send this request to Mayor McGlynn because I believe only he, the mayor, has the authority slash option to select and adopt this real estate tax exemption.

661
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:19,509
along with U.S.

662
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:20,629
City Council approval.

663
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:30,095
Under Commonwealth of Massachusetts, General Laws, Chapter 59, Section 5C.

664
00:52:35,259 --> 00:52:40,042
We the people, the working class hero, needs real estate tax relief.

665
00:52:42,423 --> 00:52:46,306
Please vote yes, help save our middle class neighbors,

666
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:48,307
before it's too late.

667
00:52:50,268 --> 00:52:58,069
Thank you kindly for listening and hopefully getting this done for its 10 years overdue.

668
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:01,810
Thanks again.

669
00:53:04,710 --> 00:53:05,670
Thank you, Mr. President.

670
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,271
I want to make one more very, very important point.

671
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:14,412
What would you think if I asked this city council to assess

672
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:18,812
the residents of Medford, a $24 tax rate.

673
00:53:19,652 --> 00:53:21,093
It's now $12, right?

674
00:53:21,914 --> 00:53:40,084
But when you go for the minimum factor, what you're doing really is putting that $24 tax rate that you think that you're assigning to the CIPs, the commercial, industrial, and personal property taxes, you're putting that on the budget.

675
00:53:41,165 --> 00:53:44,106
And who pays 80% of the budget but the residents?

676
00:53:44,246 --> 00:53:45,187
Now, here you are.

677
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:54,359
charging the residents $24 per 1,000 on that particular category, which is new growth.

678
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,841
I think the people ought to know that.

679
00:53:58,242 --> 00:54:02,084
They are paying a $24 tax rate with this minimum factor.

680
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:09,750
Councilor Longo-Kern.

681
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,372
Thank you, President Camuso.

682
00:54:12,899 --> 00:54:19,741
Considering that Councilor Marks isn't present tonight, this is one of the two most important issues this council votes on.

683
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:24,222
Not only that, but we have a whole host of information, so another week would not hurt.

684
00:54:25,243 --> 00:54:42,348
I also want to get the figures on the free cash for 2011, what was put into free cash, 2011, 2012, 2013, because I will have a motion to reduce the levy by that figure, or an average of that figure.

685
00:54:43,122 --> 00:54:45,267
I move to table this matter until next week.

686
00:54:46,169 --> 00:54:49,617
Motion for table has been request, which ends all debate.

687
00:54:51,128 --> 00:54:56,631
Would you withdraw it so we can at least read the two resolutions that we're asking for so we can take an official vote on it and then move it right again?

688
00:54:57,391 --> 00:54:59,893
All right, it's two resolutions we're asking for.

689
00:54:59,933 --> 00:55:09,638
Council Lungo Kern, 2011, 2012, and 2013, how much certified free cash was signed off on by the Department of Revenue and certified.

690
00:55:10,458 --> 00:55:12,819
And by Councilor Penta, 2011, 2012, and 2013, Comcast and Verizon paid to Channel 3.

691
00:55:21,052 --> 00:55:21,772
They paid into the city.

692
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:22,993
They paid into the city.

693
00:55:23,013 --> 00:55:27,614
And then the other one is how much was paid to Channel 3 for fiscal years 2011 and 2012.

694
00:55:27,894 --> 00:55:33,196
On those two motions, one further motion.

695
00:55:33,256 --> 00:55:43,019
One further correction, I think Councilor Longo's current motion is basically for the years 11, 12, and 13, how much did that represent a surplus in those years of city's budgets?

696
00:55:43,179 --> 00:55:43,539
All of it.

697
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:44,119
The free cash.

698
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:45,179
That's why it gets certified.

699
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:49,281
Yeah, I want the actual documents showing how much was certified too.

700
00:55:49,521 --> 00:55:50,261
That's what you asked for.

701
00:55:51,105 --> 00:55:52,045
Thank you, Councilor Pinto.

702
00:55:52,625 --> 00:55:54,766
On the motion, these two resolutions, all those in favor?

703
00:55:55,246 --> 00:55:55,326
Aye.

704
00:55:55,646 --> 00:55:56,807
All those opposed, the ayes have it.

705
00:55:57,507 --> 00:56:01,408
Once again, Councilor Lungo-Kern, motion to table, which is undebatable.

706
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:02,288
All those in favor?

707
00:56:02,668 --> 00:56:02,768
Aye.

708
00:56:02,788 --> 00:56:04,489
All those opposed, the ayes have it.

709
00:56:04,669 --> 00:56:05,869
It is tabled until next week.

710
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:10,571
Councilor De La Russo.

711
00:56:15,052 --> 00:56:17,653
Councilor De La Russo, your light was blinking.

712
00:56:19,863 --> 00:56:31,267
Yes, we want to take, Mr. President, there's a paper from the mayor requesting a transfer of funds from one account to another, if we could address that.

713
00:56:32,888 --> 00:56:34,309
I believe it's item number 14776.

714
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,292
The paper was presented to us in packet with detail.

715
00:56:53,113 --> 00:56:54,294
Item 14-776.

716
00:56:54,474 --> 00:56:58,237
On the motion of Councilor Dela Russo, do you take this paper?

717
00:56:58,377 --> 00:56:59,018
All those in favor?

718
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:00,239
All those opposed?

719
00:57:00,259 --> 00:57:01,020
The ayes have it.

720
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:01,981
Item 14-776.

721
00:57:03,242 --> 00:57:10,068
To the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, dear Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body

722
00:57:10,488 --> 00:57:23,493
approve the transfers from overlay surplus to revaluation account 0101415310 totaling $200,000 as outlined in the attached memo from the city assessor and the board of assessors.

723
00:57:24,413 --> 00:57:36,798
These amounts will fund two year, year two of the cyclical inspection program as required by the Bureau of Local Assessment of the Department of Revenue and to defend the pending appellate tax board cases.

724
00:57:37,518 --> 00:57:42,923
City Assessor Ed O'Neill and the City Auditor Anne Baker are present this evening to answer any questions you may have.

725
00:57:46,246 --> 00:57:48,267
On the motion of Councilor Dela Russo for approval.

726
00:57:48,928 --> 00:57:49,689
All those in favor.

727
00:57:50,089 --> 00:57:50,650
Councilor Knight.

728
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,491
Point of information, Mr. President.

729
00:57:52,671 --> 00:58:02,540
Um, last week we discussed the cyclical reevaluation process that's in place and um, Assessor O'Neill did have,

730
00:58:03,496 --> 00:58:12,884
get back to us and I was hoping that he'd be able to provide the general public with an update as to where we are in the revaluation cycle in terms of the DOI mandated process that needs to take place.

731
00:58:15,486 --> 00:58:20,050
For you, Mr. President, that was Council Resolve 14770.

732
00:58:22,842 --> 00:58:35,647
The real property inspect re-inspection program is nearing the year of end one as of October 6,279 residential and 545 commercial industrial exempt exterior inspections have been completed.

733
00:58:36,788 --> 00:58:42,870
We are in the process of putting a letter together to mail out to the people that have not had the interior inspection.

734
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:46,191
The owner can schedule this with the appraisal vendor directly.

735
00:58:47,652 --> 00:58:47,752
Um,

736
00:58:48,732 --> 00:58:50,874
This is a mandate every nine years.

737
00:58:51,154 --> 00:58:53,536
We are in year one of the project.

738
00:58:53,696 --> 00:59:08,908
Before you is a overlay reserve transfer to overlay surplus to fund year two and also to fund, I believe it was about eight or nine appellate tax board case to be able to defend those.

739
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:15,653
The estimated number of outstanding inspections is about 7,160 residential and about 775 commercial industrial exempt.

740
00:59:22,345 --> 00:59:27,209
Um, Mr O'Neill, thank you very much for getting back to the council in such a timely fashion.

741
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:39,878
Um, in terms of the appellate tax book cases that are out there, pending is, uh, those cases handled internally or as outside council hired, uh, uh, the board of assessors, uh, tries to handle and negotiate those internally.

742
00:59:39,898 --> 00:59:47,504
And sometimes, uh, when a push comes to shove, we need expert assistance, uh, whether it be an appraiser or an attorney.

743
00:59:48,323 --> 00:59:50,424
that deals with those cases on a daily basis.

744
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,345
So it's a case-by-case?

745
00:59:51,525 --> 00:59:52,206
Case-by-case.

746
00:59:52,386 --> 00:59:52,666
Excellent.

747
00:59:52,686 --> 00:59:53,607
Thank you very much, Mr. O'Neill.

748
00:59:53,627 --> 00:59:54,127
I appreciate it.

749
00:59:54,167 --> 00:59:54,567
You're welcome.

750
00:59:55,388 --> 00:59:57,549
On the motion of approval, Councilor DelaRusso.

751
00:59:58,410 --> 00:59:59,150
All those in favor?

752
00:59:59,771 --> 00:59:59,851
Aye.

753
01:00:00,031 --> 01:00:00,651
All those opposed?

754
01:00:00,691 --> 01:00:01,272
The ayes have it.

755
01:00:02,572 --> 01:00:04,534
Roll call on this paper.

756
01:00:05,154 --> 01:00:07,456
Vice President Caviello.

757
01:00:08,576 --> 01:00:09,337
Councilor DelaRusso.

758
01:00:09,477 --> 01:00:09,617
Yes.

759
01:00:10,237 --> 01:00:10,698
Councilor Knight.

760
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:11,138
Yes.

761
01:00:11,538 --> 01:00:12,199
Councilor Kern.

762
01:00:12,799 --> 01:00:12,999
Yes.

763
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:13,940
Councilor Martz.

764
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:14,060
Yes.

765
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,741
Councilor Panda.

766
01:00:18,102 --> 01:00:19,582
Yes, 16 affirmative, one absent.

767
01:00:20,222 --> 01:00:21,263
The paper passes.

768
01:00:21,523 --> 01:00:21,883
Thank you.

769
01:00:22,003 --> 01:00:22,343
Thank you.

770
01:00:23,024 --> 01:00:23,464
All right.

771
01:00:24,824 --> 01:00:31,207
Item 14-769, location of poles, attachments of fixtures, and underground conduits.

772
01:00:31,867 --> 01:00:41,591

The petitioner agrees to reserve space for one cross arm at suitable point on each of said poles for the fire police telephone and telegraph signal wires belonging to the municipality and used by it exclusively for municipal purposes.

783

No city-owned or private utilities or other structures are adversely impacted.

785
01:02:13,914 --> 01:02:18,477
National Grid shall ensure that all sewer, water, and drain lines are marked prior to any excavation.

786
01:02:19,038 --> 01:02:26,403
Concrete sidewalk panels damaged by the work must be immediately replaced or, if during the winter season, replaced the following spring.

787
01:02:27,023 --> 01:02:32,227
Before beginning work, the contractor shall notify DIGSAFE and shall obtain applicable permits from the Engineering Division.

788
01:02:32,787 --> 01:02:40,433
The contractor shall utilize city of Medford regulation and standards for restoration as well as remove all debris related to its work.

789
01:02:42,375 --> 01:02:44,377
This was also approved by the superintendent of wires.

790
01:02:44,957 --> 01:02:53,224
Call 7 8 1 3 9 3 2 4 2 5 for any accommodation slash aids signed Edward P Finn city clerk plans can be viewed in the city clerk's office 7 8 1 3 9 3 2 4 2 5.

791
01:02:56,487 --> 01:03:01,571
At this point, I'm going to open up the public hearing for those in favor of this proposal.

792
01:03:02,457 --> 01:03:03,057
in favor.

793
01:03:03,937 --> 01:03:05,058
Name and address for the record.

794
01:03:06,538 --> 01:03:08,018
I'm Mary Ellen Murphy.

795
01:03:08,198 --> 01:03:11,759
I work for National Grid, 170 Medford Street, Malden.

796
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:20,801
And what happened here was that there was already a poll line existing that fed the American Legion.

797
01:03:22,442 --> 01:03:26,363
Unfortunately, it goes across the

798
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:34,979
property next door which that owner has decided to divide up into three sections and build some housing there.

799
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:53,092
So what we're going to do is we already have an easement that the American Legion has agreed to, not signed yet, of putting a pole on their property and then this pole that's going in between the other two

800
01:03:54,479 --> 01:03:56,441
is going to feed that pole on their property.

801
01:03:56,481 --> 01:04:00,384
So everything will be taken off the property at 333 Winthrop Street.

802
01:04:02,085 --> 01:04:04,427
And that's all overhead.

803
01:04:04,447 --> 01:04:12,093
I'm not sure why it says underground, but I guess that would include putting the pole in the ground.

804
01:04:12,213 --> 01:04:14,935
And we're going to put transformers on that pole.

805
01:04:16,516 --> 01:04:19,719
All the utilities will come off that pole that feeds the American Legion.

806
01:04:21,712 --> 01:04:26,294
Like I said, we already have an easement started, which is not signed yet.

807
01:04:28,555 --> 01:04:28,856
OK.

808
01:04:28,896 --> 01:04:29,196
Thank you.

809
01:04:29,876 --> 01:04:31,317
Anyone in favor?

810
01:04:32,277 --> 01:04:32,778
In favor?

811
01:04:32,838 --> 01:04:39,661
Seeing and hearing no one else, I now close that portion of the public hearing and open it up to anyone in opposition.

812
01:04:40,762 --> 01:04:41,842
Anyone in opposition?

813
01:04:43,523 --> 01:04:51,147
Seeing and hearing none, I now close that portion of the public hearing and call upon Vice President Caraviello, Chairperson of Licensing.

814
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:52,744
Thank you, Mr. President.

815
01:04:52,924 --> 01:04:57,707
Uh, I reviewed the papers and they appear to be in order and a motion for approval on the motion for approval.

816
01:04:57,767 --> 01:05:00,128
Counselor Knight and then counselor Della Russo.

817
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:01,689
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

818
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:02,730
Um, Ms.

819
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:09,314
Murphy, if I can ask a couple of questions, um, if approved, do you know when the work will start?

820
01:05:09,394 --> 01:05:10,235
How long after approval?

821
01:05:10,915 --> 01:05:14,578
Um, well, like I said, we have to get the easement first.

822
01:05:17,518 --> 01:05:21,681
That should be shortly, because I think we applied for that back in October.

823
01:05:23,062 --> 01:05:27,925
And once that's signed, we can probably start.

824
01:05:28,845 --> 01:05:31,907
Once construction starts, do you know how long this project is going to take?

825
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:36,450
A day or two, I think.

826
01:05:39,932 --> 01:05:43,675
And do you anticipate this project being done in the winter months or in the spring months?

827
01:05:44,967 --> 01:05:47,348
Probably next, this month or next month.

828
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:53,632
Is that Councilor?

829
01:05:57,293 --> 01:05:58,574
I am, Mr. President.

830
01:05:58,594 --> 01:05:58,894
Thank you.

831
01:05:59,014 --> 01:06:00,695
Councilor DelaRusso, then Councilor Penta.

832
01:06:01,516 --> 01:06:13,582
If I could just, Mr. President, mention that I saw in some of the items under suspension that we have coming up, there was concern about a utility

833
01:06:14,352 --> 01:06:22,516
Uh, I think it was a resolution by Councilor Knight, uh, by one of the utilities, uh, not returning things back to their proper order.

834
01:06:23,137 --> 01:06:42,147
And I want to, uh, take this opportunity to remind the representative of National Grid, uh, with all due kindness, but firmly, uh, to remind them that, uh, they are obliged to return, um, uh, any, uh, of the roadways, sidewalks, and, and abutting areas to their, uh,

835
01:06:43,126 --> 01:06:58,539
natural pristine state after the work is done so that the traffic and pedestrians and especially those with disabilities are unimpeded after that work.

836
01:07:00,221 --> 01:07:00,581
Thank you.

837
01:07:01,162 --> 01:07:02,042
Councilor Henton.

838
01:07:02,883 --> 01:07:03,364
Two points.

839
01:07:03,564 --> 01:07:06,026
I think this is your first time here?

840
01:07:06,046 --> 01:07:08,328
You've been here.

841
01:07:08,748 --> 01:07:09,409
You've been here before?

842
01:07:09,429 --> 01:07:09,969
Second.

843
01:07:09,989 --> 01:07:10,650
Second, okay.

844
01:07:11,775 --> 01:07:16,059
This council voted well over a year ago, and then again during this past summer on Terrace Road.

845
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:18,601
Two light poles came down.

846
01:07:20,082 --> 01:07:26,808
And when National Grid went there, whoever they hired for contractor, what they did is they filled the holes and they never put the poles back up with the lights.

847
01:07:27,428 --> 01:07:28,849
It's a serious public safety issue.

848
01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:32,733
The council's on record on two separate times in voting for that.

849
01:07:33,734 --> 01:07:36,856
National Grid went up there, they marked the street, but they never put the poles back.

850
01:07:38,177 --> 01:07:39,198
I'm sorry, where is this?

851
01:07:39,218 --> 01:07:39,959
Terrace Road.

852
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:51,023
On the motion of, oh, okay, I'm sorry.

853
01:07:52,544 --> 01:07:59,307
This has been brought to whoever runs the show over there in Malden numerous times, and they keep saying we're gonna get to it, and nobody's gotten to it.

854
01:08:00,067 --> 01:08:11,052
There are many folks that walk their children up and down the street in baby carriages and what have you, and that gets pretty dark at nighttime.

855
01:08:11,393 --> 01:08:11,993
Two poles.

856
01:08:13,092 --> 01:08:13,552
Two poles.

857
01:08:13,712 --> 01:08:14,373
I'll look into it.

858
01:08:14,513 --> 01:08:15,073
Terrace Road.

859
01:08:16,334 --> 01:08:23,319
And also, do you have any control over this 36% increase in the electric rate to bring back to your bosses?

860
01:08:23,339 --> 01:08:24,119
I wish I did.

861
01:08:24,139 --> 01:08:25,340
You got million dollar bonuses?

862
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:26,541
I wish I did.

863
01:08:27,902 --> 01:08:29,063
It's a shame, because you know.

864
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:33,285
Because I live in the national grid territory, too, and my rates are going to go up.

865
01:08:34,286 --> 01:08:35,767
It's just really unfair, you know?

866
01:08:36,427 --> 01:08:38,329
One year, I mean, you people are conglomerate.

867
01:08:38,349 --> 01:08:39,429
You've got gas and electric.

868
01:08:39,970 --> 01:08:41,771
So I mean, we have no control over anything.

869
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:44,991
And the poor ratepayers are going to pay another 27% to 36%.

870
01:08:45,852 --> 01:08:51,254
And as the story goes, and as it's been advertised, all your bonuses of a million dollars plus went to your higher executives.

871
01:08:51,314 --> 01:08:53,015
And I don't know how they can justify that.

872
01:08:53,075 --> 01:08:53,655
It's just wrong.

873
01:08:54,435 --> 01:09:01,859
I think they're justifying it by saying that the increase in fuel costs, but I'm not sure that.

874
01:09:03,399 --> 01:09:04,300
You're the engineer, right?

875
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:04,880
Yeah.

876
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:05,820
From National Grid?

877
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:06,020
Right.

878
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,822
You want to send a separate resolution to the corporate office?

879
01:09:09,182 --> 01:09:09,742
You could do that.

880
01:09:10,652 --> 01:09:14,875
On the motion of Councilor Penta to send a resolution inquiring why the rates went up.

881
01:09:15,576 --> 01:09:16,136
All those in favor?

882
01:09:16,156 --> 01:09:16,396
No, no, no.

883
01:09:16,416 --> 01:09:17,497
We know the rates went up.

884
01:09:17,617 --> 01:09:17,797
Why?

885
01:09:17,937 --> 01:09:24,562
I just think, I think if they're going to have the rates, I just think it's unfair that they would take million dollar bonuses in their contracts.

886
01:09:24,942 --> 01:09:25,262
All right.

887
01:09:25,382 --> 01:09:25,963
So we'll send that.

888
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:29,125
On the motion of Councilor Penta, all those in favor?

889
01:09:29,485 --> 01:09:29,585
Aye.

890
01:09:29,906 --> 01:09:30,566
All those opposed?

891
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:31,447
Councilor Knight.

892
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:33,900
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

893
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,561
I also want to take the opportunity to thank Ms.

894
01:09:35,601 --> 01:09:43,326
Murphy, because last time she appeared before the Council, I raised some concerns that I had relative to a sidewalk and a street repair between Smith Ave.

895
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:47,769
and Hicks Ave., which is the subject of a resolution that I'm going to be bringing up this evening under suspension.

896
01:09:48,489 --> 01:09:49,430
And although Ms.

897
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:56,714
Murphy works, from what I can tell, in the distribution of electricity, within a week, they were out there and they had fixed the street from Hicks Ave.

898
01:09:56,754 --> 01:09:57,295
to Smith Ave.

899
01:09:57,315 --> 01:09:59,656
and repaired it into its natural and pristine condition.

900
01:09:59,716 --> 01:10:00,797
So, Ms.

901
01:10:00,837 --> 01:10:02,318
Murphy, I want to thank you for your efforts on that.

902
01:10:02,935 --> 01:10:07,940
because it was two days later that I drove down the street and I saw the sawhorses out there and they were ready to get to work.

903
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:09,361
So thank you very much for your efforts.

904
01:10:09,461 --> 01:10:17,488
And I trust that if you were able to do something with the 37% increase in the electrical bill, in the two or three days from now, we'd probably see it taken care of.

905
01:10:17,508 --> 01:10:19,771
So thank you very much for your past work on behalf of this council.

906
01:10:20,912 --> 01:10:21,192
Thank you.

907
01:10:22,033 --> 01:10:23,234
On the motion of the vice president.

908
01:10:24,755 --> 01:10:25,456
All those in favor?

909
01:10:25,816 --> 01:10:25,996
Aye.

910
01:10:26,216 --> 01:10:26,877
All those opposed?

911
01:10:26,897 --> 01:10:26,957
Aye.

912
01:10:27,558 --> 01:10:28,018
Ayes have it.

913
01:10:28,118 --> 01:10:28,779
Thank you very much.

914
01:10:33,686 --> 01:10:36,054
And on the motion to revert back to the regular order of business.

915
01:10:36,114 --> 01:10:36,797
All those in favour?

916
01:10:37,816 --> 01:10:39,577
All those opposed, the ayes have it.

917
01:10:39,717 --> 01:10:43,438
Item 14-774, offered by Councilor Knight.

918
01:10:43,938 --> 01:10:55,283
Be it resolved that the MBTA take the proper steps to ensure that the route 96 bus makes all scheduled stops persuadent to the established and publicized bus stop locations.

919
01:10:55,863 --> 01:11:02,826
Be it further resolved that the MBTA give specific attention to the stop located at Medford Square and City Hall parking lot.

920
01:11:03,326 --> 01:11:05,327
As recent reports allege that the weekdays

921
01:11:06,311 --> 01:11:06,612
6 a.m.

922
01:11:06,672 --> 01:11:07,813
and Saturday 6 a.m.

923
01:11:07,873 --> 01:11:11,536
bus frequently bypass this established and publicized location.

924
01:11:11,997 --> 01:11:12,537
Councilor Knight.

925
01:11:13,779 --> 01:11:15,100
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

926
01:11:15,120 --> 01:11:28,273
I was recently contacted by a number of members of the laborers union who are working on a project in Harvard square and they reside in Medford and they walk down to Medford square city hall and they get on the bus to take that bus to Harvard square.

927
01:11:29,262 --> 01:11:31,864
because parking is such a hassle over there.

928
01:11:32,484 --> 01:11:37,206
And it's been brought to my attention that usually on Thursdays and Saturdays, the 6 a.m.

929
01:11:37,266 --> 01:11:46,912
bus fails to make a stop at the City Hall stop, Mr. President, resulting in these individuals being late for work or having to take taxis to work.

930
01:11:47,632 --> 01:11:51,074
I think the reason that this happens is because of the way the route's structured.

931
01:11:51,094 --> 01:11:57,197
It has to go past, you know, the old Tony Lucci's, take a left down river, come back past City Hall Plaza, and then do the loop again.

932
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:03,912
So maybe in the interest of time, some of these drivers are bypassing a certain stop that may or may not be busy all the time.

933
01:12:04,292 --> 01:12:07,435
However, it's had an impact on these hardworking individuals.

934
01:12:07,475 --> 01:12:17,323
So I'd like a letter to be sent out to the MVTA to be sure that their drivers are made aware of the fact that that is a stop and that that's a stop that means a lot to the residents here in the city of Medford.

935
01:12:17,703 --> 01:12:18,784
It's a publicized stop.

936
01:12:18,824 --> 01:12:19,505
It's on their schedule.

937
01:12:19,525 --> 01:12:20,145
It's on their route.

938
01:12:20,165 --> 01:12:21,526
So it's a stop that they should be making.

939
01:12:22,747 --> 01:12:23,448
Thank you.

940
01:12:23,728 --> 01:12:25,149
When I sit down, I wanted to add something to that.

941
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:26,050
Absolutely.

942
01:12:27,217 --> 01:12:31,178
The chair recognizes Vice President Cara Villalo.

943
01:12:34,458 --> 01:12:35,499
Thank you, Mr. President.

944
01:12:35,519 --> 01:12:50,302
While we're talking about that same route, on Riverside Avenue, right in front of the doctor's office with the benches, I don't know if any of you have driven by there, but the street has kind of been raised up by all the buses that go by there on Salem Street.

945
01:12:50,722 --> 01:12:54,483
I don't know if that's our responsibility to fix that, but the T's,

946
01:12:57,258 --> 01:13:07,341
As I say, if you drive by there, right at the stop, you'll see a huge lift in the road from the buses that always stop right directly across from River Street.

947
01:13:08,702 --> 01:13:09,762
And to the DPW?

948
01:13:10,582 --> 01:13:17,884
I don't know who's responsible for fixing that, but it's directly right at the bus stop in front of the little power plant and right there.

949
01:13:18,345 --> 01:13:22,406
So on the motion to send that to the MBTA, all those in favor?

950
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:27,332
because you said Salem Street and Riverside Ave.

951
01:13:27,692 --> 01:13:35,558
That's right, right on Salem Street, right where the power station is, there's the bench there on the station.

952
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:36,979
Oh, so on Salem Street.

953
01:13:36,999 --> 01:13:38,080
It's actually on Salem Street.

954
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:40,182
Okay.

955
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:41,503
Directly across from River Street.

956
01:13:41,803 --> 01:13:42,644
Directly across, okay.

957
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:49,389
Right there, you see there's a huge, it's probably up in the air, probably about seven or eight inches from all the buses pulling in there.

958
01:13:50,362 --> 01:14:04,721
Okay On the motion of on the motion of council a night and amended by vice president care of yellow all those in favor Guys have it

959
01:14:06,069 --> 01:14:20,602
Item 14-775, petition for a reversal of a sign denial by Bowler Engineering for Wendy's, 330 Middlesex Avenue, Medford Mass, OCD application 2014A, excessive number of primary signs.

960
01:14:21,222 --> 01:14:25,406
In 2014B, excessive number of primary signs.

961
01:14:25,927 --> 01:14:27,968
2014C, excessive number of primary signs.

962
01:14:30,771 --> 01:14:31,892
Name and address for the record.

963
01:14:32,897 --> 01:14:34,740
Um, thank you, uh, Mr. President.

964
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:46,036
Uh, my name's Anthony Donato with Bowler engineering and, um, so we'd like to present this appeal, um, to this, to the counselors.

965
01:14:46,336 --> 01:14:48,960
Uh, we have this proposed restaurant.

966
01:15:01,764 --> 01:15:06,528
In the audience with us tonight, we have Mr. Chad Adams, who works for Wendy's.

967
01:15:06,588 --> 01:15:15,596
I'd just like to present to you the proposed renderings of the new restaurant.

968
01:15:16,217 --> 01:15:22,622
And it depicts the signs on three sides, which is similar to other fast food establishments in the area.

969
01:15:23,043 --> 01:15:24,944
It's located in the industrial area.

970
01:15:25,585 --> 01:15:27,667
And currently, the building is set back about

971
01:15:28,703 --> 01:15:31,926
30 feet further than adjacent buildings on either side of the property.

972
01:15:32,266 --> 01:15:36,109
And there is a six foot chain link fence on the property.

973
01:15:36,369 --> 01:15:46,616
So to maintain competitiveness with other fast food restaurants in the area, we are proposing to present this, uh, these, um, this signage on this proposed building.

974
01:15:46,637 --> 01:15:51,060
I don't have any questions with regards to the renderings.

975
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,183
Chair recognizes Councilor DelaRusso who has the papers.

976
01:15:56,307 --> 01:16:09,972
If I could, Mr. President, this falls under the Business and Economics Development and Signs Committee, chaired by Councilor Marks, who's absent this evening for a personal emergency.

977
01:16:11,293 --> 01:16:22,457
If you could just explain, the restaurant's undergoing a renovation, and this sign brings it up to the franchise standard or the corporate standard of advertisement.

978
01:16:23,965 --> 01:16:26,106
Yeah, if I might, my name's Chad Adams.

979
01:16:26,286 --> 01:16:29,067
I'm the regional construction manager for Wendy's.

980
01:16:29,787 --> 01:16:38,169
The address is 40 General Warren Boulevard, Suite 260, Melbourne, Pennsylvania.

981
01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:45,832
Wendy's is currently undergoing a major rebranding of its image to bring it up to the market.

982
01:16:47,853 --> 01:17:07,689
more in line with contemporary standards and what the public is looking for in terms of not only interior modifications, Wi-Fi, more digital type of menus and formatting on the inside, but also on the outside to kind of give it a new look.

983
01:17:07,749 --> 01:17:12,853
You're moving into the new millennium and to get it away from the old-fashioned hamburgers to the

984
01:17:13,547 --> 01:17:22,030
you know, with the current product offering, which is more than just hamburgers, it's salads, it's chicken, it's a wide variety of different products.

985
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:30,052
So we're kind of dropping the hamburger aspect off of our main tagline and just coming up with just Wendy's.

986
01:17:30,852 --> 01:17:37,014
So this is what the, this is what the image is that we're moving actively across the country.

987
01:17:37,574 --> 01:17:39,515
And the signage, re-signage is,

988
01:17:40,294 --> 01:18:01,379
is part of that, where you have the old Wendy's sign that's more of a, really like an 1890s type font that you might see in old time days, stuff to a more contemporary script, still maintaining the company logo image of the Wendy's.

989
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:02,640
A little Wendy.

990
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:03,440
A little Wendy.

991
01:18:04,807 --> 01:18:20,439
But it is, and the way we're trying to set it up, it's not necessarily more is better, but strategically placing the signage where it gets the biggest bang for the buck.

992
01:18:20,459 --> 01:18:22,841
The average sign is, I think it's 32 square feet.

993
01:18:25,460 --> 01:18:33,102
including the cameo, and we've placed it strategically on the front blade element, which is this element here.

994
01:18:33,762 --> 01:18:40,003
We have another accent element in the drive-thru window, or the other side of the building.

995
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:54,226
And then on the non-drive-thru side, or the main vestibule, we have just the accent that kind of delineates, helps delineate the entry point into the building on the non-drive-thru side.

996
01:18:55,185 --> 01:18:58,206
And that's the basic signage elements.

997
01:18:58,226 --> 01:19:03,787
Now, there are some other non-illuminated signs that we're requesting as well.

998
01:19:04,347 --> 01:19:12,789
They're more, I would call them, classify them more as like artwork, in that they don't say Wendy's, they don't convey the product.

999
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:15,350
They're basically trying to convey

1000
01:19:17,275 --> 01:19:22,657
Quality so quality is our Difficulty

1001
01:19:38,867 --> 01:19:41,929
service that doesn't have corners is our recipe.

1002
01:19:42,469 --> 01:19:51,034
And basically, the only people that can see that are people that are in the drive-thru lane, because it's protected by the two outcrops there.

1003
01:19:51,514 --> 01:19:56,357
And the last sign is just basically one that says, thank you, then we hang off there.

1004
01:19:56,397 --> 01:20:03,581
It's two square feet, mainly just informational, and really serves no purpose other than that.

1005
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:07,843
Part of the package that people are, you know,

1006
01:20:08,987 --> 01:20:15,296
pick up your order, you see the thank you, and you get a thank you from the service rep at the window.

1007
01:20:16,337 --> 01:20:17,098
Thank you very much.

1008
01:20:17,138 --> 01:20:23,346
Mr. President, because of the location of this restaurant and that it's not

1009
01:20:24,933 --> 01:20:33,879
In a dense residential area, it's a standalone store that's removed, drawn back from the main avenue there quite a bit.

1010
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:40,323
I see no problem with allowing these requests, so I move approval.

1011
01:20:40,883 --> 01:20:42,885
On the motion of approval, Council Member Kern.

1012
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,025
Thank you, President Camuso.

1013
01:20:44,666 --> 01:20:50,169
It looks like there's 10 specific requests, and that does include your exit and enter signs.

1014
01:20:50,550 --> 01:20:51,010
Can you just

1015
01:20:52,275 --> 01:20:58,877
describe to us or explain which the illumination portion of signs that possibly will be illuminated?

1016
01:20:59,197 --> 01:20:59,797
Yeah.

1017
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:09,400
With respect to the exit and entry said directional signs and the main, you know, pylon sign, the only changes we're doing is the faces.

1018
01:21:09,521 --> 01:21:11,641
So the script matches the building.

1019
01:21:12,081 --> 01:21:14,242
Those will be illuminated internally.

1020
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:16,663
The Wendy's signs, the Wendy's,

1021
01:21:21,803 --> 01:21:24,365
Those will be internally illuminated as well.

1022
01:21:24,986 --> 01:21:25,586
And that's it.

1023
01:21:25,706 --> 01:21:39,318
The other signs, the sign that's in the little cubby here, and the thank you sign, and then this quality of the recipe sign that's over the entry, those are not illuminated.

1024
01:21:39,338 --> 01:21:42,681
So you have about, so six out of 10 are illuminated?

1025
01:21:43,882 --> 01:21:44,082
Yes.

1026
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:48,126
And what hours do you plan on illuminating them?

1027
01:21:48,472 --> 01:21:52,534
Right now, we would illuminate them during the hours of operation.

1028
01:21:52,994 --> 01:21:59,138
And right now, I believe we have permission to operate till 1 o'clock in the morning.

1029
01:22:01,819 --> 01:22:07,542
By ordinance, does the illumination have to cease at 11 or 10?

1030
01:22:08,623 --> 01:22:11,224
I think it ceases at 1 hour after it closes.

1031
01:22:11,264 --> 01:22:13,966
That's what I said.

1032
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:26,282
I think the signs go off when you close, but the light lot can remain illuminated for one hour for safety purposes, allow the workers to get to their cars.

1033
01:22:26,803 --> 01:22:30,804
So right now the current signs are illuminated until one o'clock?

1034
01:22:31,144 --> 01:22:31,644
That's correct.

1035
01:22:31,864 --> 01:22:35,265
Okay, and you've got no complaints about that from residents?

1036
01:22:35,285 --> 01:22:36,545
Not that I'm aware of.

1037
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:43,467
Okay, and we were told tonight there was a development going behind Wendy's, which is gonna be apartments.

1038
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:48,882
Will any of these signs be facing the exterior of your building?

1039
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:56,405
None of them will be facing the rear of the building, which is where that development's going to take place.

1040
01:22:56,425 --> 01:22:58,926
OK.

1041
01:23:03,408 --> 01:23:04,789
I think, yeah, that's it.

1042
01:23:04,829 --> 01:23:06,429
That's it, Councilor?

1043
01:23:06,469 --> 01:23:06,769
Thank you.

1044
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:08,530
Just one quick question.

1045
01:23:08,550 --> 01:23:09,551
Councilor Penta.

1046
01:23:09,591 --> 01:23:11,472
Councilor, Alango brings up a good point.

1047
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:14,633
Even though you're open, would you say to 1 o'clock?

1048
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:15,555
That's correct.

1049
01:23:17,176 --> 01:23:29,305
We have a situation on the parkway at Stations Landing, and because Kelly's Roast Beef is opposite the residential homes over there, she's right, they have to shut their sign down at 11 o'clock.

1050
01:23:29,625 --> 01:23:32,808
That's their big sign, not the sign that's on the building.

1051
01:23:33,328 --> 01:23:38,212
So I'm assuming that Wendy sign right there on the red brick facade, that's your biggest sign?

1052
01:23:40,535 --> 01:23:42,217
No, on the facade, the red.

1053
01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:33,021
Point of information, Councilor DelaRusso.

1054
01:24:33,181 --> 01:24:34,642
Are the present signs illuminated?

1055
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:36,044
Yes.

1056
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:40,147
Thank you.

1057
01:24:40,227 --> 01:24:43,910
As long as those signs aren't facing the residential homes, correct?

1058
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:47,013
No, they're not.

1059
01:24:47,553 --> 01:24:47,794
Okay.

1060
01:24:47,934 --> 01:24:50,015
Which residential homes?

1061
01:24:50,516 --> 01:24:50,976
Apartments.

1062
01:24:55,884 --> 01:25:01,508
Thank you just one more question about your pylon sign that's That is gonna be changed by hand.

1063
01:25:01,588 --> 01:25:03,489
That's not gonna be a rotating sign.

1064
01:25:03,509 --> 01:25:05,211
Yeah, that's my hand.

1065
01:25:06,612 --> 01:25:06,892
Okay?

1066
01:25:06,952 --> 01:25:08,153
Unless you want to see a digital one.

1067
01:25:08,453 --> 01:25:17,480
Nope second the approval The way it is on the motion of the council of Dela Rousseau seconded by council Lungo Kern all those in favor All those opposed the ayes have it

1068
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:23,001
On the motion of Vice President Caraviello to take the papers in the hands of the clerk under suspension.

1069
01:25:23,141 --> 01:25:23,861
All those in favor?

1070
01:25:24,881 --> 01:25:25,641
All those opposed?

1071
01:25:27,182 --> 01:25:28,182
Offered by Councilor Knight.

1072
01:25:28,682 --> 01:25:37,004
Be it resolved the Office of Disability looked into the National Grid sidewalk repairs between Smith Ave and Hicks Ave to ensure ADA compliance.

1073
01:25:37,564 --> 01:25:42,204
Be it further resolved the findings of the Office of Disability to the council and the school department.

1074
01:25:42,284 --> 01:25:43,505
Councilor Knight.

1075
01:25:43,545 --> 01:25:44,805
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1076
01:25:46,190 --> 01:25:55,212
As I alluded to earlier in the meeting, National Grid is doing some gas line repairs along the stretch of Main Street between Smith Ave and Hicks Ave.

1077
01:25:55,992 --> 01:26:00,934
And over the last couple of days, they've ripped up several sidewalk slabs.

1078
01:26:01,254 --> 01:26:06,115
However, they've ripped up sidewalk slabs on either side of the street from Smith down to Hicks.

1079
01:26:06,735 --> 01:26:12,020
which would make it very difficult for a person in a wheelchair, a person with a cane, to walk down the street, Mr. President.

1080
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:20,327
Also, whereas Hicks Ave is the entrance to the Columbus School, I feel as though this may pose a risk to the students that are looking to walk to school, Mr. President.

1081
01:26:20,347 --> 01:26:28,794
So I'm asking that our office of disability take a look and make sure that the project specifications meet ADA compliance for an accessible pathway for individuals.

1082
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:31,119
who might have to traverse that road, Mr. President.

1083
01:26:31,559 --> 01:26:39,401
I'd also ask that her findings be reported to the school department to ensure that Mr. Belson's well aware of this safety situation down there.

1084
01:26:39,742 --> 01:26:45,744
I would leave it to the Office of Disability to determine whether or not they feel as though a police detail is going to be needed down there during the construction project.

1085
01:26:46,364 --> 01:26:51,486
At this point in time, I don't have any inkling of understanding as to how long this project's gonna take.

1086
01:26:51,826 --> 01:26:58,328
I do know that I personally saw at least 12 sidewalk slabs on either side of the street torn up, so I don't think this is a one-day project.

1087
01:26:58,715 --> 01:27:06,219
And based upon the weather that we're going to receive and have been receiving, I don't think this is going to be something that's going to be done in a fashion that's going to be suitable for a longterm solution.

1088
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:08,420
If in fact they do get out there to plug these holes.

1089
01:27:08,941 --> 01:27:19,126
Um, so I'm asking that, um, miss McLeod and our office of disability take a look and, uh, make sure that, you know, the, the contractor out there is in compliance with the federal law on the motion.

1090
01:27:19,327 --> 01:27:23,789
Uh, have the office of disability report back to the council and the school department.

1091
01:27:24,249 --> 01:27:27,131
All those in favor, all those opposed, the ayes have it.

1092
01:27:27,561 --> 01:27:28,522
offered by Councilor Knight.

1093
01:27:29,063 --> 01:27:39,137
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Medford High School standout girls soccer player, Corey O'Rourke, on being named Boston Herald All-Scholastic and GBL MVP.

1094
01:27:39,638 --> 01:27:44,945
Be it further resolved, Corey O'Rourke be invited to appear before the Medford City Council to accept council commendation.

1095
01:27:46,438 --> 01:27:47,959
On the motion of approval, Counselor Knight.

1096
01:27:48,539 --> 01:27:49,959
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1097
01:27:50,019 --> 01:27:54,061
I think that, uh, this fine scholar athletes accolades speak for themselves.

1098
01:27:54,281 --> 01:27:57,803
Uh, she was the MVP of the greater Boston league this year.

1099
01:27:57,943 --> 01:28:03,405
She led her team to the GBL championship title for the girls soccer team here at Medford high school.

1100
01:28:03,465 --> 01:28:08,667
And she was also, um, asking Boston Herald Oskalastic, which is one of the highest accolades that, uh,

1101
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:10,711
a high school athlete can achieve.

1102
01:28:11,131 --> 01:28:21,156
I think that she joins the ranks of some other great Medford athletes like Sean Bates, Jake Perrazzo, and Brittany Lanzilli to be named Boston Herald All Scholastic.

1103
01:28:21,176 --> 01:28:30,421
So I think it would be fitting to invite her down here to receive a council accommodation and to offer her our congratulations on her great effort and great representation of the student athletes in Medford High School.

1104
01:28:30,441 --> 01:28:30,641
Absolutely.

1105
01:28:31,241 --> 01:28:32,982
On the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1106
01:28:33,752 --> 01:28:34,913
All those opposed, the ayes have it.

1107
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:37,194
Offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Camuso.

1108
01:28:37,255 --> 01:28:45,460
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the GBL Championship Team, Medford High School Girls Volleyball Team on their successful season.

1109
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:50,924
Be it further resolved the team be invited to appear before the Medford City Council to accept council commendation.

1110
01:28:51,084 --> 01:28:51,605
Councilor Knight.

1111
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:53,711
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1112
01:28:53,731 --> 01:29:00,693
This falls in line with what we did over the spring when we had the rowing team up here who was GBL champions for both the boys and the girls teams.

1113
01:29:01,234 --> 01:29:09,357
I think that it's nice to see our scholar athletes being so successful on the field and in the classroom, and I think it's only fitting that we bring them down here and recognize their achievement.

1114
01:29:10,503 --> 01:29:12,024
On the motion of approval, all those in favor?

1115
01:29:12,044 --> 01:29:13,185
All those opposed?

1116
01:29:13,205 --> 01:29:13,685
The ayes have it.

1117
01:29:14,406 --> 01:29:22,571
Offered by Councilor Knight and Councilor Camuso, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the GBL Champion MHS Girls Soccer Team on their successful season.

1118
01:29:23,112 --> 01:29:28,836
Be it further resolved, the team be invited to appear before the Medford City Council to accept City Council commendations.

1119
01:29:28,896 --> 01:29:29,436
Councilor Knight.

1120
01:29:29,996 --> 01:29:34,580
Again, Mr. President, as I just stated before, I think it's great to see such success on the field and also in the classroom.

1121
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:39,603
These student athletes are a great representation of the city of Medford and our public school system.

1122
01:29:39,953 --> 01:29:42,754
and I think that it would be fitting to bring them down here and recognize their achievement.

1123
01:29:43,014 --> 01:29:43,354
Excellent.

1124
01:29:44,075 --> 01:29:47,536
On the motion of approval, all those in favor, those opposed, the ayes have it.

1125
01:29:47,636 --> 01:29:51,018
Item 14 dash seven, seven, seven offered by counselor night.

1126
01:29:51,538 --> 01:30:03,243
Be it resolved that an audit be performed on all taxi cab companies licensed to operate in the city of Medford to verify and ensure compliance with the ordinances of the city of Medford that govern such operation.

1127
01:30:03,823 --> 01:30:04,423
Counselor night.

1128
01:30:05,523 --> 01:30:06,704
Mr. President, uh,

1129
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:11,444
In recent months past, we've had a licensing committee meeting to discuss the rates for taxicabs.

1130
01:30:11,804 --> 01:30:15,507
We've had a number of license requests come by before this council.

1131
01:30:15,868 --> 01:30:22,874
I think that it's important, Mr. President, that if in fact we are going to be issuing these licenses, that we make sure that these operators are in compliance with our rules and regulations.

1132
01:30:23,134 --> 01:30:27,078
There's been a lot of discussion about the implementation of a taxicab ordinance, Mr. President.

1133
01:30:27,378 --> 01:30:29,320
But at this point in time, I'm going to withdraw this matter.

1134
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:33,684
I'd like Councilor Marks to be here because he's expressed a number of issues of concern that he has.

1135
01:30:34,063 --> 01:30:36,484
So I'd like to withdraw the matter, and I'll refile it at a later date.

1136
01:30:36,684 --> 01:30:38,384
On the motion to withdraw, all those in favor?

1137
01:30:38,985 --> 01:30:39,545
All those opposed?

1138
01:30:39,585 --> 01:30:40,105
The ayes have it.

1139
01:30:40,845 --> 01:30:43,886
Item 14-778, offered by Councilor Penta.

1140
01:30:44,306 --> 01:30:49,688
Be it resolved that the mayor's new parking slash revenue meter slash kiosk program be discussed.

1141
01:30:50,168 --> 01:30:50,808
Councilor Penta.

1142
01:30:51,148 --> 01:31:01,692
Mr. President, as an update to the proposed parking by Republic, which now appears like it's not going to take place until January of this forthcoming year,

1143
01:31:03,535 --> 01:31:13,345
There was something, and I have already responded to the chamber on this, there was something that was put out by the chamber basically talking about business parking implementation meetings.

1144
01:31:14,106 --> 01:31:21,713
And they sent a memo out to their members, and it basically is saying that the chamber at 1 Shipyard Way in room 302 will hold four

1145
01:31:23,983 --> 01:31:36,606
meetings, one for Hain Square, which is tomorrow night, one for the Meffitt Hillside in South Meffitt, which will be on Thursday, the 11th, and then next Wednesday, West Meffitt on the 17th, and then on the 18th, Meffitt Square.

1146
01:31:37,406 --> 01:31:46,628
And then it says, next week, and this was issued out this past Friday, a representative from Republic Parking will be visiting the business areas to distribute flyers regarding the meetings.

1147
01:31:47,388 --> 01:31:50,548
Please be sure to email or call the chamber to reserve a seat.

1148
01:31:51,149 --> 01:31:52,369
Seating will be limited to 25 people,

1149
01:31:53,839 --> 01:31:54,359
per meeting.

1150
01:31:55,080 --> 01:31:59,804
Well, first of all, the Chamber of Commerce has nothing to do with Republic.

1151
01:31:59,844 --> 01:32:04,328
This is a city of Medford undertaking, and this was the mayor's contract with Republic.

1152
01:32:05,549 --> 01:32:12,755
If the Chamber of Commerce now be the linchpin, so to speak, between the city and Republic, I just don't think that's right.

1153
01:32:12,816 --> 01:32:13,536
That's number one.

1154
01:32:14,117 --> 01:32:17,720
Number two, to walk around and pass out a flyer

1155
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:21,633
Point of information, Vice President Caravaglia.

1156
01:32:22,113 --> 01:32:27,801
This was requested by Republic through the Chamber of Commerce to do this, not the Chamber of Commerce asking Republicans.

1157
01:32:28,362 --> 01:32:36,012
The other way around, Republic has been trying to get out in front of this, and they're asking to do it through the Chamber of Commerce, not the opposite way around.

1158
01:32:36,332 --> 01:32:36,733
Good idea.

1159
01:32:37,188 --> 01:32:43,396
Well, as a point of further information, and I think you're aware of it, not everybody in the chamber was for this and agreed to this.

1160
01:32:43,997 --> 01:32:45,338
So let's be honest about it.

1161
01:32:45,398 --> 01:32:50,885
This is a City of Medford undertaking, not a Chamber of Commerce undertaking, number one.

1162
01:32:51,226 --> 01:32:55,491
Number two, it's not an $18 million revenue enhancement for the City of Medford.

1163
01:32:55,953 --> 01:33:09,244
The overall contract between expenditures and final payment to the city would be approximately $9 million at the end of the 10-year of the contract, not $18 million that everyone's touting and making people think that's what the city's going to get.

1164
01:33:09,705 --> 01:33:17,852
But more importantly, if they were going to have these meetings and to identify the locations, number one, why would you squirrel 25 people into a room?

1165
01:33:18,619 --> 01:33:21,641
just in case you've got an overflow of people, that's number one.

1166
01:33:21,681 --> 01:33:33,528
Number two, why would you be having it at 5.30 at night when a lot of the business merchants, because I spoke to them, would rather have it early in the morning because at late at night they just can't pick up and leave, and the dock of night closes their shops down if they're single proprietors.

1167
01:33:34,269 --> 01:33:40,993
Number two, and number three, and more importantly, and most importantly, if they're taking the time to walk to each one of these squares and pass out flyers,

1168
01:33:41,633 --> 01:33:51,780
they could have had enough time to find a location in each one of these four squares to accommodate them in their own particular district, so they'd be able to understand firsthand what they're talking about.

1169
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,964
I just don't think it's right, Mr. President and members of the council.

1170
01:33:56,024 --> 01:33:59,286
The chamber, they do a lot of wonderful things, but this is not their ballgame.

1171
01:33:59,586 --> 01:34:01,027
This is the city of Medford's ballgame.

1172
01:34:01,047 --> 01:34:02,028
This is the mayor's ballgame.

1173
01:34:02,248 --> 01:34:03,589
It's his package with Republic.

1174
01:34:04,029 --> 01:34:05,050
They should have figured this out.

1175
01:34:05,791 --> 01:34:07,132
The chamber now would be the middleman.

1176
01:34:08,353 --> 01:34:11,716
Cutting down whatever interferences for the mayor, I think it's wrong.

1177
01:34:11,736 --> 01:34:15,218
And if this is Republic's way of doing it, they're going on the wrong foot.

1178
01:34:15,339 --> 01:34:27,768
And more importantly, it would have been nice if the seven councils, if at least I, I'll speak for myself, got an invitation from Republic if we would like to participate, if you would like to be there, you have any questions or concerns.

1179
01:34:28,289 --> 01:34:30,170
Once again, the council's just excluded.

1180
01:34:31,731 --> 01:34:33,533
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1181
01:34:34,508 --> 01:34:43,491
I received correspondence from the Chamber of Commerce inviting me to come, gave me a list of all the dates that it was coming, that it was going to be held and locations and times, emailed right to my inbox.

1182
01:34:43,871 --> 01:34:45,372
I did the same, thank you.

1183
01:34:45,392 --> 01:34:47,633
The Chamber of Commerce is not Republic.

1184
01:34:48,233 --> 01:34:53,455
The Chamber of Commerce is not the City of Medford and they don't profess to be the City of Medford or profess to represent the City of Medford.

1185
01:34:53,835 --> 01:34:59,957
The Chamber of Commerce is nothing more than a liaison that Republic is using for the purpose of selling their particular program.

1186
01:35:01,017 --> 01:35:02,057
It's not their program.

1187
01:35:02,318 --> 01:35:03,438
It's the City of Medford's program.

1188
01:35:03,905 --> 01:35:08,387
It's the taxpayers program, and they're the ones that are gonna have to take the brunt of what all this is all about.

1189
01:35:08,747 --> 01:35:15,870
It should be coming right here out of this city hall, out of this man, this is his program, and it should have been identified in all four sections of the city.

1190
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:22,613
Not in the Chamber of Commerce, and not to squirrel 25 people into a room, just in case more than 25 decided to come.

1191
01:35:22,633 --> 01:35:24,014
What are they gonna do, tell them that they can't come?

1192
01:35:25,374 --> 01:35:26,795
Point of information, Vice President.

1193
01:35:26,975 --> 01:35:33,398
If there are more than 25 people attending one, they will plan to schedule another meeting to accommodate everyone.

1194
01:35:33,965 --> 01:35:36,748
Well, there in itself is the crux of the matter, Councilor Caviello.

1195
01:35:37,109 --> 01:35:40,692
If more than 25 come, why would you even wait to have more than 25 come?

1196
01:35:40,933 --> 01:35:46,479
Why wouldn't you have found a spot ahead of time that can accommodate up to 100, every one of the four locations?

1197
01:35:46,499 --> 01:35:49,202
Again, this is the republic asking the chamber to

1198
01:35:49,562 --> 01:35:52,965
Well, then the chamber, if they had any brains, they'd have been able to figure this out.

1199
01:35:53,005 --> 01:35:54,025
And you're a member of the chamber.

1200
01:35:54,065 --> 01:35:54,766
I'm a member of the chamber.

1201
01:35:54,786 --> 01:35:55,646
You serve on the board.

1202
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:56,227
You've got a voice.

1203
01:35:56,247 --> 01:35:56,927
You can speak up.

1204
01:35:56,987 --> 01:35:58,468
I'm only one vote on that board.

1205
01:35:58,508 --> 01:35:59,889
Well, you can speak up about it.

1206
01:35:59,909 --> 01:36:01,371
I'm only one vote on that board.

1207
01:36:01,511 --> 01:36:03,652
Well, maybe you should speak up a little louder.

1208
01:36:03,812 --> 01:36:04,913
I speak up on multiple boards.

1209
01:36:04,933 --> 01:36:09,156
Councilor De La Rosa, you're a member of the board.

1210
01:36:09,276 --> 01:36:09,777
I just think...

1211
01:36:11,895 --> 01:36:14,996
should be placed under some sort of cross-examination by the consular.

1212
01:36:15,376 --> 01:36:20,098
And I'm dreadfully sorry that the world doesn't revolve to his liking.

1213
01:36:20,718 --> 01:36:20,998
Thank you.

1214
01:36:21,018 --> 01:36:22,499
You don't have to be dreadfully sorry.

1215
01:36:22,799 --> 01:36:25,780
You should just stand up and speak up and take a position and that's all.

1216
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,300
And the position is very clear.

1217
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:34,942
If you're a member of the chamber and you know that there are four sections of the city that are going to be affected, why would you want to put 25 people into a room and you had more than 25?

1218
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:36,723
We'll have to set the time for another time.

1219
01:36:37,363 --> 01:36:40,265
Why would you just find the location and the area that they're going to be?

1220
01:36:40,305 --> 01:36:41,085
Point of information.

1221
01:36:41,105 --> 01:36:54,053
I believe, I believe consulate Dela Russo voted in favor of a resolution asking Republic to come to each individual business district here in the city to present an information session with the business owners and the residents thereof.

1222
01:36:54,373 --> 01:36:55,854
He voted in support of this resolution.

1223
01:36:55,874 --> 01:36:58,976
The resolution was brought forward maybe seven weeks ago and it passed six to one.

1224
01:36:59,616 --> 01:37:03,078
Um, so I think that when you say have a voice, consulate Dela Russo did have a voice.

1225
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:06,162
He used his voice here as a councilor to speak about his position on that.

1226
01:37:06,482 --> 01:37:13,446
What's going on in the Chamber of Commerce and this private organization and the private decisions that they make really has no effect on what we do here as a council.

1227
01:37:13,467 --> 01:37:14,587
I disagree with you, Councilor.

1228
01:37:14,607 --> 01:37:15,428
This is over and above.

1229
01:37:15,448 --> 01:37:16,508
It's a private entity.

1230
01:37:16,528 --> 01:37:18,790
It might be a private entity, but it is not over and above.

1231
01:37:19,070 --> 01:37:21,031
This is not the Chamber's issue.

1232
01:37:21,512 --> 01:37:22,592
This is the City of Medford.

1233
01:37:22,913 --> 01:37:24,073
This is the Mayor's position.

1234
01:37:24,394 --> 01:37:25,254
This is the contract.

1235
01:37:25,294 --> 01:37:29,477
Maybe the Chamber members... So is this about the Chamber or about your feelings towards the Mayor?

1236
01:37:30,127 --> 01:37:31,028
No, it's neither of that.

1237
01:37:31,068 --> 01:37:34,430
It's the idea that this is a City of Medford contract, is it not?

1238
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:37,751
Is it not a City of Medford contract, Councilor DelaRusso?

1239
01:37:37,812 --> 01:37:39,933
It's a City of Medford contract, but Republic.

1240
01:37:39,953 --> 01:37:42,114
I'm sorry things don't go the way you'd like them.

1241
01:37:42,214 --> 01:37:45,536
Well, I'm sorry things don't go your way all the time as well, okay?

1242
01:37:45,756 --> 01:37:52,980
And maybe if you were more active, you'd have an understanding, and if you walk the streets, and you listen to the people... Councilor, enough of the cheap shots.

1243
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,341
That's a cheap shot saying...

1244
01:37:56,121 --> 01:37:56,462
All of this.

1245
01:37:56,982 --> 01:37:57,183
It is.

1246
01:37:57,363 --> 01:37:57,984
It's in your mind.

1247
01:37:58,024 --> 01:37:58,284
All right.

1248
01:37:58,384 --> 01:37:59,526
Well, no, that's in your mind.

1249
01:37:59,686 --> 01:38:00,627
It isn't in my mind.

1250
01:38:00,727 --> 01:38:05,333
I've walked the streets and I talked to these business people and they would like to have had it in a particular area.

1251
01:38:07,266 --> 01:38:08,607
Listen, who's taking the cheap shot?

1252
01:38:08,648 --> 01:38:09,368
You and me right now.

1253
01:38:09,528 --> 01:38:13,092
No, some of them, some of them specifically said that they're happy about these meetings and they're glad.

1254
01:38:13,132 --> 01:38:13,313
Yeah.

1255
01:38:13,353 --> 01:38:14,414
And there's some of them that don't.

1256
01:38:14,574 --> 01:38:14,894
All right.

1257
01:38:14,994 --> 01:38:15,895
And it goes both ways.

1258
01:38:15,935 --> 01:38:17,898
Well, it's a private entity that's inviting them, not the city.

1259
01:38:17,918 --> 01:38:19,439
Well, it's a private entity that's writing them.

1260
01:38:19,459 --> 01:38:27,348
But unfortunately the private entity is doing business with the city as part of a public contract and public dollars are involved and it's just my, it's just my, Hey, listen.

1261
01:38:27,867 --> 01:38:30,049
It's my opportunity, it's my personal opinion, and that's what I'm saying.

1262
01:38:30,469 --> 01:38:32,751
I'm making my opinion, and Councilor De La Rosa doesn't like it.

1263
01:38:33,011 --> 01:38:34,632
I'm not going to apologize for him not liking it.

1264
01:38:34,932 --> 01:38:37,654
He doesn't like half the things I do, and I don't like half the things he does.

1265
01:38:37,914 --> 01:38:38,815
So what difference does it make?

1266
01:38:39,235 --> 01:38:40,756
That's our right, that's our freedom of speech.

1267
01:38:41,157 --> 01:38:47,081
That's our way of saying what we want to say on a subject matter that means something, and this means something to me, because I hear the people talking.

1268
01:38:47,601 --> 01:38:49,703
And now what are we going to do, Mr. President?

1269
01:38:49,963 --> 01:38:54,726
When it snows out, we haven't even figured out who is going to plow the sidewalks where these meters are.

1270
01:38:55,027 --> 01:38:56,708
Is it going to be the city's responsibility?

1271
01:38:57,048 --> 01:38:58,890
Is it going to be republics?

1272
01:38:59,070 --> 01:39:03,153
And what happens when a senior citizen or a handicapped person can't get to the meeting?

1273
01:39:03,873 --> 01:39:08,336
These are issues that need to be discussed and be brought out publicly to have a discussion on.

1274
01:39:09,077 --> 01:39:09,998
Still not to have it.

1275
01:39:10,238 --> 01:39:13,880
And they still haven't been able to identify the 932 parking spaces.

1276
01:39:14,120 --> 01:39:15,081
That's still up in the air.

1277
01:39:15,702 --> 01:39:16,742
So what did we accomplish?

1278
01:39:16,983 --> 01:39:21,065
And what has been accomplished by having republic come in when these haven't even been finalized?

1279
01:39:21,926 --> 01:39:33,380
This is, like Councilor DelaRusso said, and Vice President Caraviello, this is a meeting of a private entity known as the Chamber of Commerce, who is doing outreach for their members, and I applaud them.

1280
01:39:33,741 --> 01:39:35,783
So, do you have a motion, Councilor?

1281
01:39:35,803 --> 01:39:41,430
I just want to let the people know that this particular meeting, these particular meetings, I feel,

1282
01:39:41,715 --> 01:39:44,777
should have been in the four particular areas rather than in the chamber's office.

1283
01:39:45,097 --> 01:39:49,860
They could have still been the sponsor, but they could have had places where more than 25 people could have come.

1284
01:39:50,181 --> 01:39:56,365
And if they had it early in the morning rather than later at night, that's what the calls were that I got from people.

1285
01:39:56,625 --> 01:39:59,267
If they were going to go, they would have prefaced being there.

1286
01:40:00,367 --> 01:40:02,489
I would encourage you to put them all together in a room.

1287
01:40:02,749 --> 01:40:07,552
Most people that were asked by the chamber for the evening meeting versus the day meeting.

1288
01:40:07,737 --> 01:40:11,178
Well, maybe that's the people you spoke to as compared to the people I spoke to.

1289
01:40:11,639 --> 01:40:12,999
And we had this conversation Sunday.

1290
01:40:13,059 --> 01:40:17,021
Through the chamber, most people had preferred the evening meeting after work hours.

1291
01:40:17,261 --> 01:40:20,302
When you say through the chamber, you're talking about the chamber, I'm talking about the business people.

1292
01:40:20,322 --> 01:40:23,203
There's a lot of business people, Rick, that aren't chamber members.

1293
01:40:24,284 --> 01:40:34,448
Through the people that were contacted, they preferred the later hour when it was more convenient for them, because most of them open at eight o'clock in the morning, and they'd rather be there in the morning.

1294
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:37,461
Well, they can't be there at 530 at night either, so what do they do?

1295
01:40:37,501 --> 01:40:38,781
Most of them are closed by that time.

1296
01:40:38,841 --> 01:40:40,281
Well, I'm going to disagree with you.

1297
01:40:40,301 --> 01:40:40,921
Mr. President.

1298
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:51,224
Again, listen, again, this is, this is Republic asking the chamber to help them out and help facilitate this to the business areas.

1299
01:40:52,024 --> 01:40:53,784
This is not the chamber doing it on their own.

1300
01:40:54,424 --> 01:40:57,905
This is, it's part of the work that the chamber does.

1301
01:40:59,154 --> 01:41:00,255
This is outreach.

1302
01:41:00,675 --> 01:41:05,240
And I know there's a lot of businesses out there that are not members of the chamber that were also invited.

1303
01:41:06,381 --> 01:41:08,763
So this isn't chamber only specific.

1304
01:41:08,803 --> 01:41:09,263
Counselor Knight.

1305
01:41:09,884 --> 01:41:13,968
Um, it seems like Republic's willing to do some outreach work, huh?

1306
01:41:14,769 --> 01:41:15,870
If they're willing to come and meet.

1307
01:41:17,528 --> 01:41:28,070
The Republicans, they're trying to do some type of, I've seen some of the things that the Republicans are looking to do with the businesses, with people that do get tickets.

1308
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:34,971
They're trying to work with the businesses on their website to do different things with people who do get tickets.

1309
01:41:36,111 --> 01:41:40,672
And one more last thing, handicapped people don't pay the meters.

1310
01:41:43,152 --> 01:41:46,033
They don't have to worry about putting money in by law.

1311
01:41:50,085 --> 01:41:54,811
I mean, Mr. President, it's clear, I think, that republic's willing to do some outreach work.

1312
01:41:54,831 --> 01:41:56,273
We've seen them at community day.

1313
01:41:56,313 --> 01:41:59,577
We've seen them at a number of events that have gone on that the city sponsored.

1314
01:41:59,597 --> 01:42:04,943
Now we're seeing them take the efforts to go and meet with the chamber of commerce, not on one night, not on two nights, not on three nights, but on four nights.

1315
01:42:05,484 --> 01:42:07,527
So I think that, you know,

1316
01:42:08,565 --> 01:42:13,312
I'd be remiss if I didn't say that maybe we should just call Republic and ask them to put something together.

1317
01:42:13,332 --> 01:42:17,998
And if we have any constituents that have contacted us, we can have the same type of info session in room 201 or room 207.

1318
01:42:18,099 --> 01:42:24,007
I think we'd be more than able to have a meeting with, I think Republic would be more than happy to come down to a council meeting.

1319
01:42:24,623 --> 01:42:25,404
to answer any questions.

1320
01:42:25,464 --> 01:42:26,765
I mean, they've been there, they've done that.

1321
01:42:26,805 --> 01:42:28,747
I think they've answered our questions for the most part.

1322
01:42:28,787 --> 01:42:34,211
I think there'd be more than anybody to come down here and answer any questions.

1323
01:42:34,231 --> 01:42:36,393
I'm already working, I'm putting my own meetings together.

1324
01:42:36,934 --> 01:42:44,440
In terms of their track record and what they've shown us that they're willing to do, I don't think that there'd be any reason to think that they wouldn't be willing to continue to do such.

1325
01:42:44,880 --> 01:42:47,583
I think that it might make sense if we can reach out to

1326
01:42:48,604 --> 01:42:54,048
find out who the City of Medford liaison is, and then we can deal with these things on a case-by-case basis with that individual directly.

1327
01:42:54,408 --> 01:42:57,651
If we needed to put them in a room with 10 or 11 or 13 people, then so be it.

1328
01:42:57,671 --> 01:43:04,796
If business owners are calling you and they need answers, I don't think that this gentleman is going to be too afraid to come up here and give answers to the questions.

1329
01:43:04,816 --> 01:43:05,597
The contract is signed.

1330
01:43:05,657 --> 01:43:08,099
He is here.

1331
01:43:08,159 --> 01:43:08,799
At the end of the day,

1332
01:43:09,987 --> 01:43:10,227
He's here.

1333
01:43:10,247 --> 01:43:11,268
We're going to have to live with him.

1334
01:43:11,328 --> 01:43:15,670
So I don't think that they're going to want to start off on the wrong foot and create a relationship like that.

1335
01:43:16,551 --> 01:43:24,816
I really think that based on what they've shown us already, that they're willing to be a part of the conversation, to come in and to talk and to answer the questions and to show us how they want to implement this.

1336
01:43:25,896 --> 01:43:35,982
So with that being said, Mr. President, you know, I'd certainly be interested to find out what the contact information is for the liaison for Republic so that I can go and do some of that work.

1337
01:43:36,378 --> 01:43:38,841
Um, I don't need an official action to this council to get that information.

1338
01:43:38,881 --> 01:43:41,143
I can make the, make the full call and do it my own.

1339
01:43:41,644 --> 01:43:47,309
Um, however, I think that that might make a little bit more sense than, than, you know, it'll get us some results.

1340
01:43:47,370 --> 01:43:48,971
It'll bring us, it'll bring us to the end of the road yet.

1341
01:43:49,792 --> 01:43:54,377
And the mayor, um, we'll be doing outreach in several different ways.

1342
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:57,232
once all the information is readily available.

1343
01:43:58,093 --> 01:43:59,874
City hasn't started the process yet.

1344
01:44:00,175 --> 01:44:01,936
Councilor Pentzer and the gentleman at the podium.

1345
01:44:01,976 --> 01:44:05,760
What we're talking about, Mr. President, is everything that was discussed back in October.

1346
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:06,601
October 1st.

1347
01:44:08,245 --> 01:44:14,467
as reported, and it was a council meeting just prior to October 1st, where we had these discussions of having them come forward.

1348
01:44:15,107 --> 01:44:15,907
And it was your comment.

1349
01:44:16,167 --> 01:44:17,868
It was your comment at that meeting.

1350
01:44:18,268 --> 01:44:23,230
And you said that this whole parking scenario is going to be a tough pill for the business people to swallow.

1351
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:24,110
That's what you said.

1352
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:26,230
Well, it's right here.

1353
01:44:26,370 --> 01:44:28,371
I have it right here.

1354
01:44:28,831 --> 01:44:29,952
No, he said it's a tough pill.

1355
01:44:29,992 --> 01:44:31,392
It's going to be a tough pill to swallow.

1356
01:44:31,652 --> 01:44:32,212
That's your quote.

1357
01:44:32,272 --> 01:44:32,872
Okay.

1358
01:44:33,273 --> 01:44:33,853
It's on the tape.

1359
01:44:34,053 --> 01:44:34,673
It's on your quote.

1360
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:40,363
And with that being said, and recognizing then from October to now, from October to now, there's been nothing.

1361
01:44:40,623 --> 01:44:45,526
And a lot of the people in the business districts don't know who's gonna be getting these meters, who's not gonna be getting them.

1362
01:44:45,546 --> 01:44:48,528
That's the purpose of the meetings, to help to inform them.

1363
01:44:49,929 --> 01:44:56,573
If the mayor wants to have private meetings and separate meetings, I'm sure he'll have them, or maybe that's in his plans.

1364
01:44:56,633 --> 01:44:58,114
I can't speak for the mayor.

1365
01:44:59,555 --> 01:45:03,277
The chamber's trying to do their part to help everyone

1366
01:45:03,640 --> 01:45:14,166
Well, maybe it would have been nice if the council was advised and maybe we had an opportunity to see what was going on rather than have to get an invite or hear something that the chamber's sponsoring.

1367
01:45:15,027 --> 01:45:17,908
And if you want to tag along, you can come along.

1368
01:45:18,008 --> 01:45:20,069
Those meetings are open to everyone that wants to attend.

1369
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:21,911
There's no conspiracy here.

1370
01:45:21,951 --> 01:45:22,531
This is public health.

1371
01:45:22,551 --> 01:45:23,111
I didn't say that.

1372
01:45:23,171 --> 01:45:23,832
Nobody said that.

1373
01:45:25,693 --> 01:45:27,094
Again, it's here to stay.

1374
01:45:28,594 --> 01:45:31,236
It's here and they're trying to make the best out of it.

1375
01:45:32,023 --> 01:45:33,443
Name and address for the record.

1376
01:45:33,483 --> 01:45:35,424
John Stirola, 20 Metcalf Street.

1377
01:45:36,244 --> 01:45:37,184
Thank you, Mr. President.

1378
01:45:38,525 --> 01:45:40,365
I have an opinion on this matter, too.

1379
01:45:40,905 --> 01:45:47,127
I think the council should never, never have given the mayor permission to sign a 10-year contract.

1380
01:45:48,227 --> 01:45:50,587
That's the one power they had.

1381
01:45:50,687 --> 01:45:53,188
They gave it up easily, as usual.

1382
01:45:54,968 --> 01:45:57,669
He already had the power to sign a three-year contract.

1383
01:45:58,609 --> 01:46:01,710
And in that event, the damage would have been minimized.

1384
01:46:03,005 --> 01:46:05,867
I don't have a crystal ball, but I do want to make a point.

1385
01:46:07,869 --> 01:46:15,115
The administration and the people of this city are going to regret that paid parking was ever installed.

1386
01:46:18,137 --> 01:46:19,479
Name and address for the record, sir.

1387
01:46:20,272 --> 01:46:23,113
John Byers, 22 Alston Street, Medford.

1388
01:46:23,273 --> 01:46:26,053
Just a point of context here in this whole conversation.

1389
01:46:27,573 --> 01:46:47,037
This was the mayor's veiled attempt at making brownie points after being called out on TV three times by the citizens and having Channel 5 and Channel 7 come down and their investigators do reports on how poor the city of Medford

1390
01:46:47,444 --> 01:46:49,506
takes care of its parking problems.

1391
01:46:50,186 --> 01:47:04,336
And the mayor did this because he got thoroughly embarrassed and he tried to throw this council under the proverbial bus saying that this council did not want to do anything to curb the parking problem.

1392
01:47:04,776 --> 01:47:07,318
So this is his way of saying, screw you Medford.

1393
01:47:07,799 --> 01:47:10,060
I'm doing this without your permission.

1394
01:47:10,080 --> 01:47:13,943
All right.

1395
01:47:15,760 --> 01:47:17,800
Councilor Pinto's motion receive a place on file.

1396
01:47:20,421 --> 01:47:20,661
John.

1397
01:47:23,402 --> 01:47:23,982
One last thing.

1398
01:47:24,022 --> 01:47:29,063
I think you forgot to mention and that whole commentary that you just talked about when channel seven came.

1399
01:47:29,103 --> 01:47:29,363
Yes.

1400
01:47:30,083 --> 01:47:33,024
What was the comment that the mayor made when they were asked him about the public park?

1401
01:47:33,124 --> 01:47:40,246
He said the city council will not allow us to do what we need to do to help the parking problem.

1402
01:47:40,266 --> 01:47:42,266
I think he said, I think he said, John,

1403
01:47:42,670 --> 01:47:45,451
that the council did not put the money in the budget for them.

1404
01:47:45,491 --> 01:47:47,332
And that's absolutely not true.

1405
01:47:47,352 --> 01:47:48,873
Which is totally not true.

1406
01:47:48,893 --> 01:47:51,394
This council each and every year has been supportive of them.

1407
01:47:51,514 --> 01:48:05,900
And just to make a further point, after seeing that report, I called Hank Philippi Ryan and I spoke to someone at Channel 7 and made the point to them that the mayor totally had lied to Hank Philippi Ryan in making

1408
01:48:07,320 --> 01:48:12,007
And I pointed out that the mayor threw the council under the bus.

1409
01:48:12,387 --> 01:48:17,474
I told him, Councilor Michael J. Marks has been asking for a number of years.

1410
01:48:19,014 --> 01:48:26,320
about getting a comprehensive parking program in the city, and every time he is blocked by this mayor.

1411
01:48:27,101 --> 01:48:33,967
Now, the mayor, as I said, was called out three times within less than a year's time by Channel 5.

1412
01:48:34,207 --> 01:48:36,649
When Channel 5 was called down about the

1413
01:48:43,015 --> 01:48:47,799
the inaccurate information being given about odd even parking during the winter.

1414
01:48:47,819 --> 01:49:00,589
And then the parking program and the, oh God, I'm losing my train of thought here.

1415
01:49:00,809 --> 01:49:01,930
The, oh.

1416
01:49:03,771 --> 01:49:04,832
Relax, take it, it'll come.

1417
01:49:14,283 --> 01:49:27,347
Basically what I'm saying is what has to happen is this council as a whole has to proverbial grow a set, stand up to the smear and say no, we're not going to allow this.

1418
01:49:27,367 --> 01:49:32,489
The last time we had parking meters in this city, there were problems and we ended up pulling them out.

1419
01:49:32,549 --> 01:49:35,930
Now the smear wants to throw us back into the stone age again.

1420
01:49:36,650 --> 01:49:37,590
with parking meters.

1421
01:49:37,630 --> 01:49:38,730
That isn't the way to go.

1422
01:49:38,810 --> 01:49:43,211
The way to go is to have a comprehensive parking program, and that's it.

1423
01:49:43,791 --> 01:49:47,752
What I was trying to say is about the permitted parking, by the way.

1424
01:49:47,812 --> 01:49:59,975
That's what I was going to mention, the fact that the permitted parking and people are being told after they have paid their permits to park.

1425
01:50:03,035 --> 01:50:03,195
Okay.

1426
01:50:03,916 --> 01:50:05,816
All in the motion receive and place on file.

1427
01:50:07,752 --> 01:50:08,312
All those opposed?

1428
01:50:08,352 --> 01:50:08,893
The ayes have it.

1429
01:50:09,314 --> 01:50:10,395
We have two sets of records.

1430
01:50:10,816 --> 01:50:15,301
Councillor... Suspension of the rules.

1431
01:50:21,058 --> 01:50:23,219
Good evening, Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave.

1432
01:50:23,719 --> 01:50:36,202
I wanted to inform the public that yesterday I attended a press conference the mayor had with a Comcast representative, Sheila Willett, very nice woman, speaking about a program, an old program that Comcast had.

1433
01:50:36,502 --> 01:50:37,362
It's seven years old.

1434
01:50:38,003 --> 01:50:39,383
They put it aside and now it's back.

1435
01:50:39,403 --> 01:50:40,323
It's called Every Block.

1436
01:50:41,164 --> 01:50:45,085
Now you can go on the city website and see Every Block and get the press release.

1437
01:50:45,525 --> 01:50:45,905
Excuse me.

1438
01:50:45,925 --> 01:50:46,905
One second.

1439
01:50:47,385 --> 01:50:50,046
Can you gentlemen take the conversation outside please so we can hear the

1440
01:50:50,705 --> 01:50:51,486
The guy at the podium.

1441
01:50:52,347 --> 01:50:54,089
Thank you so much, sir.

1442
01:50:54,129 --> 01:50:55,350
Council President, thank you.

1443
01:50:56,871 --> 01:51:00,035
This Everyblock, you can do a web search on it.

1444
01:51:00,255 --> 01:51:02,658
I think it's everyblock.com, but search it to make sure.

1445
01:51:03,238 --> 01:51:05,020
And the city website does have information.

1446
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:06,101
No, it's intriguing.

1447
01:51:07,856 --> 01:51:11,439
The woman from Comcast asked if there were any questions, and no one asked a question.

1448
01:51:11,479 --> 01:51:17,503
So I said, well, we already pay Comcast for Peg Access, and we're not getting the product.

1449
01:51:18,003 --> 01:51:19,544
So can you elaborate on that?

1450
01:51:19,725 --> 01:51:25,889
And the mayor went up, and Councilor Caraviello was there, along with Tim Kelly from Comcast.

1451
01:51:26,009 --> 01:51:33,655
And the mayor said, next week, there will be a press conference, and that he is going to give us an access TV station.

1452
01:51:34,528 --> 01:51:37,271
So I want the council to hold the mayor at his word.

1453
01:51:38,693 --> 01:51:49,125
It would have been nice if that press conference yesterday was held in Alden Chambers, and I would hope the city council can respectfully ask the mayor to start having more public hearings.

1454
01:51:49,185 --> 01:51:52,749
That videotape I did of the parking meter video

1455
01:51:53,897 --> 01:51:56,939
That was an important meeting with people out the door.

1456
01:51:57,019 --> 01:51:58,620
It would have been great to have it here.

1457
01:51:59,061 --> 01:52:04,064
These chambers are wonderful, hallowed halls, and I think that they would serve this city well.

1458
01:52:04,485 --> 01:52:09,168
So anyway, that conference was about every block.

1459
01:52:09,708 --> 01:52:16,953
Next week, we're going to have a preface conference, according to the mayor, on his new proposal for an access TV station.

1460
01:52:17,454 --> 01:52:19,996
Please, City Council, hold him to his promise.

1461
01:52:20,536 --> 01:52:21,757
I don't want to hear him go back on it.

1462
01:52:22,690 --> 01:52:25,878
There'll be an announcement on the forthcoming.

1463
01:52:27,292 --> 01:52:28,692
I do have a comment on this again.

1464
01:52:28,752 --> 01:52:30,633
John Byers, 22 Wall Street.

1465
01:52:32,573 --> 01:52:36,974
This idea of the mayor saying there's going to be an access station, there has to be one thing made clear.

1466
01:52:37,514 --> 01:52:44,215
We will not accept any of the mayor's cronies running the access station, that being a Mr. Jack Dempsey.

1467
01:52:44,675 --> 01:52:48,956
We need to have someone that is not involved in the mayor's circle.

1468
01:52:49,016 --> 01:52:49,896
Point of information.

1469
01:52:49,916 --> 01:52:52,817
I don't think we need to name the gentleman by name over here, Mr. President.

1470
01:52:52,837 --> 01:52:53,537
That's inappropriate.

1471
01:52:54,371 --> 01:53:05,696
Well, I'm sorry you don't like that, but we can't have people like that running the access station, because basically what will end up happening- The same thing can be said about a number of people, you know what I mean, Mr. President?

1472
01:53:05,716 --> 01:53:08,017
I just don't think it's conducive to a positive debate.

1473
01:53:08,077 --> 01:53:10,578
The mayor will be appointing people that he feels fit.

1474
01:53:13,207 --> 01:53:18,790
We can't have any of that because if that happens, then he'll have control of the station.

1475
01:53:19,390 --> 01:53:24,633
And people like me who have been outspoken against him will not be allowed on that station.

1476
01:53:24,673 --> 01:53:31,477
He'll keep people that have... Mr. Baez, you'll always be allowed at the access station if you're a member in good standing.

1477
01:53:31,797 --> 01:53:31,997
What?

1478
01:53:32,277 --> 01:53:35,078
You will always be allowed at the Medford access station.

1479
01:53:35,559 --> 01:53:38,480
If you are a member in good standing, no one's going to keep you out.

1480
01:53:38,780 --> 01:53:45,783
Well, I, I'm not saying, I'm not saying that I'm going to be kicked out, but there'll be stringent rules put against me because I've been outspoken against him.

1481
01:53:46,043 --> 01:53:46,723
Thank you very much.

1482
01:53:47,124 --> 01:53:47,664
Thank you, sir.

1483
01:53:49,425 --> 01:53:52,286
The records of November 25th were passed the council.

1484
01:53:52,526 --> 01:53:56,788
Mr. President on page number two 12,

1485
01:53:58,786 --> 01:54:13,655
under resolution 14754, amendment number C. It's by amendment, it says amended by Councilor Panter and Councilor Longo-Curran, that OCD report back on what has information they have.

1486
01:54:14,315 --> 01:54:16,496
I don't know what that means, it doesn't make any sense.

1487
01:54:19,518 --> 01:54:21,459
Well, let's go to page, go page 12, 14754, number C.

1488
01:54:27,608 --> 01:54:31,971
And then we go to, you got it?

1489
01:54:33,312 --> 01:54:33,532
Yeah.

1490
01:54:34,632 --> 01:54:39,335
I don't know what the correction, I don't know what the term, the sentence doesn't make sense.

1491
01:54:40,356 --> 01:54:43,338
No, I'm telling you that needs to be corrected.

1492
01:54:46,520 --> 01:54:49,061
I'm reading section C here, it doesn't make sense, the second line.

1493
01:54:49,882 --> 01:54:53,784
I don't know what you have, and you have to go back to the tape and look at it, I don't know.

1494
01:54:54,524 --> 01:54:55,125
You take a look at it?

1495
01:54:56,005 --> 01:54:56,926
It doesn't make any sense.

1496
01:54:57,417 --> 01:55:10,401
And then we go to page 213, 14759, and under A, after the word but, that doesn't make sense.

1497
01:55:14,943 --> 01:55:21,525
It says, vended by myself of a street, if your street was not swept, but were tagged, ticket and towed,

1498
01:55:22,449 --> 01:55:24,450
I don't know if it's a resident or if it means your car.

1499
01:55:25,110 --> 01:55:26,511
I don't know, I don't know what it's supposed to be.

1500
01:55:26,531 --> 01:55:27,932
You're gonna have to go back and look at the tape.

1501
01:55:28,352 --> 01:55:31,394
That's the one you said to go to the mayor and take care of the tickets.

1502
01:55:31,654 --> 01:55:32,775
Yeah, but it doesn't say that.

1503
01:55:33,775 --> 01:55:45,041
It says, if your street, if your street was not swept, but were tagged, ticketed, and towed, is it your car or a resident was tagged?

1504
01:55:45,341 --> 01:55:47,362
I don't know, maybe it's a resident's car.

1505
01:55:47,723 --> 01:55:49,764
Maybe those are the appropriate words that have to be put in there.

1506
01:55:50,264 --> 01:55:51,685
I don't know what but were tagged means.

1507
01:55:52,793 --> 01:55:58,895
What's, what's Eddie just, just go, just the sentence.

1508
01:55:58,935 --> 01:56:03,036
It doesn't make sense to take a look at the tape and we can figure out exactly what it is.

1509
01:56:05,737 --> 01:56:07,237
So we're going to table those still.

1510
01:56:08,017 --> 01:56:09,758
No, I have no problem as long as he corrects them.

1511
01:56:09,778 --> 01:56:10,118
That's all.

1512
01:56:10,138 --> 01:56:16,620
It's just, it's grammar, but it doesn't, it's not making any sense on the motion with further clarification of approval.

1513
01:56:18,390 --> 01:56:19,030
All those in favor?

1514
01:56:19,311 --> 01:56:19,591
Aye.

1515
01:56:20,011 --> 01:56:20,611
All those opposed?

1516
01:56:20,632 --> 01:56:21,152
The ayes have it.

1517
01:56:21,492 --> 01:56:24,654
The records of December 2nd were passed to Vice President Carabiello.

1518
01:56:25,795 --> 01:56:26,455
How did you find them?

1519
01:56:30,478 --> 01:56:31,499
On the motion of approval.

1520
01:56:32,779 --> 01:56:33,480
All those in favor?

1521
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:33,900
Aye.

1522
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:34,721
All those opposed?

1523
01:56:34,841 --> 01:56:35,361
The ayes have it.

1524
01:56:35,541 --> 01:56:38,123
On the motion of Council Appendix for adjournment.

1525
01:56:38,243 --> 01:56:38,904
All those in favor?

1526
01:56:38,924 --> 01:56:39,004
Aye.

1527
01:56:39,024 --> 01:56:39,704
All those opposed?

1528
01:56:39,724 --> 01:56:40,224
The ayes have it.

1529
01:56:40,244 --> 01:56:40,925
Yes, thank you, Larry.
