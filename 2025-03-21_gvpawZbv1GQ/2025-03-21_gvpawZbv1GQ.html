    <p>[Elizabeth Bayle]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=219.607s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=220.187s">My</a>  name is Karen Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=221.988s">I'm</a>  a resident of Arlington, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=225.091s">I'm</a>  here tonight on behalf of Fellsway Property, which is located on Riverside Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=230.475s">Address,</a>  please. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=232.877s">88</a>  Woodside Lane in Arlington, Mass.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=236.6s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Elizabeth Bayle]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=237.283s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=238.764s">Good</a>  evening, members of the Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=242.268s">We</a>  first appeared before you approximately a year ago, pretty close to a year ago this evening, when the Nor'easter that evening was a snowstorm. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=253.578s">We</a>  met before the Committee of the Whole to introduce ourselves to you as the new owners of Fellsway Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=260.778s">And</a>  at the time, we reviewed our proposals for improvements to the plaza, including facade renovations and the exciting news for new tenants. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=272.982s">And</a>  we briefly discussed at the time our proposal for a restaurant pad along Riverside. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=280.644s">During</a>  our introduction, we <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=283.882s">We</a>  wanted to assure you that when we represented something to a community that we followed through. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=290.187s">And</a>  I hope that you certainly and the residents of Medford are very pleased with the results of our facade renovations and see the investments that we've so far made in a very outdated and underutilized property. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=306.96s">We</a>  are very excited about the progress that we have made so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=311.212s">There's</a>  a lot happening out there that you don't see and it results in significant investment in the infrastructure for Fellsway Plaza. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=320.677s">And</a>  so the continuation of that is the proposed restaurant pad along Riverside. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=326.28s">We</a>  presented our application for special permit for site plan review to the Community Development Board in August and received approval from them at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=336.491s">We're</a>  here before you this evening for the application for the drive-through for the Panera use, which of course is a special permit before the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=347.153s">The</a>  Panera, and shown on the plan and in your application materials, is tenant A, and we're very excited to have Panera and Smashburger, which recently received Common Vic and I believe also a liquor license from the council, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=364.878s">and</a>  then Noodles as Tenant C. Through the process of our approvals before the Community Development Board, we also had an opportunity to meet with several of the neighbors along the 4th Street neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=381.431s">They</a>  had raised some concerns about the general overall condition of the property, and specifically, they had concerns related to odor control. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=389.911s">We're</a>  very pleased that so far our tenants have agreed through the process of receiving the Common Vic license from the city council to employ additional odor control mechanisms and our other tenants are also amenable to that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=406.578s">So</a>  we think that we've presented a great plan for Fells Lake Plaza, a great plan for this property and we have <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=417.838s">opened</a>  a line of communication with the neighbors in the area, which I believe really was not existent before we took title to the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=426.88s">So</a>  we hope that you find this along the same lines as the balance of our work that we've done in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=436.642s">Joining</a>  me this evening in the event you have any questions are Ken Staffia, our civil engineer from <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=442.82s">VHB,</a>  and also Pat Dunford, who is our traffic engineer, also from VHB. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=448.763s">I</a>  am sorry to report that our attorney, Bob Abruzzi, has had a medical issue, and he is not able to be present this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=458.089s">So</a>  we will try to answer as many questions as you can, but think that we may have to continue some portion of this matter until Bob can be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=468.7s">Is</a>  there any questions?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=470.08s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=470.64s">The</a>  public hearing is still open. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=472.041s">Anyone</a>  else in favour?</p>

    <p>[Jeanne Martin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=481.002s">I</a>  promised her I'd get up here and just say I'm in favour. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=483.243s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=484.883s">Anyone</a>  else in favour? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=487.464s">Hearing</a>  and seeing none, I now close that portion of the hearing and open it up to anybody in opposition.</p>

    <p>[QuIJp-vSiqo_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=502.825s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=503.526s">My</a>  name is Kristen Bartlett. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=504.967s">I</a>  currently reside at 488 Riverside Avenue, Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=509.992s">So</a>  I live right across the street from the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=512.254s">I'm</a>  a little bit concerned about a few different aspects. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=517.118s">Of</a>  course, with the stop and shop being there and a few other, you know, real retail, excuse me, spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=523.998s">It</a>  does get quite noisy, and we do encounter a lot of traffic getting in and out of our driveway, parking on the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=532.886s">My</a>  house is usually blocked off. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=534.908s">I'm</a>  usually asking someone at least once or twice a week, and I keep normal business hours for work to move their vehicle so that I can park in front of my house and not have to walk a block or so with my four-year-old. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=548.97s">I</a>  really oppose having an exit for this establishment on Riverside Avenue just due to the traffic that we do encounter with the exit just about a block or so up from our home. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=562.382s">It's</a>  very difficult to turn in and out, very difficult to get onto the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=568.247s">The</a>  infrastructure I don't think really supports making a drive-through establishment right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=575.069s">people</a>  aren't paying attention when they come in and out, so it's a little bit difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=580.315s">Also,</a>  and I guess, again, I don't know whether this has been established or not, the hours for this, with the Dunkin' Donuts being at that set of lights, it's hard enough to get past the McGlynn School to get to the highway on a daily basis.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=600.829s">So</a>  you are not in favor?</p>

    <p>[QuIJp-vSiqo_SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=603.451s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=603.991s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=605.572s">Anybody</a>  else not in favor of this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=609.875s">Not</a>  in favor of this project? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=612.276s">Seeing</a>  and hearing none, I now close that portion of the public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=616.919s">And</a>  are we waiting for the attorney or are you proceeding? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=621.098s">I</a>  know your attorney wanted to wait until the 23rd.</p>

    <p>[Elizabeth Bayle]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=625.299s">We</a>  would like to wait for the 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=627.02s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=627.66s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=628.5s">Well,</a>  the attorney wants to be here to answer the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=630.421s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=631.201s">It's</a>  the will of the council, whatever the council wants. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=633.602s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=634.862s">I'd</a>  recommend that in the absence of their legal counsel and representation that we defer this till that time in which it can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=645.586s">So</a>  I motion to table.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=647.006s">On</a>  the motion for table, which is undebatable, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=650.2s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=655.882s">Well,</a>  the attorney asked, and they have legal representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=662.465s">There's</a>  a motion to table on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=663.946s">The</a>  clerk will call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=671.589s">And</a>  till end, the motion is till the 23rd. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=673.81s">Is</a>  that correct or not?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=676.133s">Was</a>  that the data indicated by council? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=677.814s">I</a>  received a message from him today. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=679.354s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=679.955s">He</a>  asked that consideration be made and I don't see any, I know there was a very interesting group of neighbors.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=685.757s">There's</a>  a motion to table, so I don't want to cut you off, councilor, but there's a motion to table.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=689.218s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=690.478s">On</a>  my motion.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=691.658s">On</a>  Councilor Dello Russo's motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=693.839s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=695.38s">Clerk,</a>  we'll call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=696.86s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=698.001s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=699.221s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=700.441s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=701.122s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=701.762s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=702.422s">Councilor</a>  McCurry. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=703.022s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=704.523s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=808.011s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=810.904s">Ed</a>  O'Neill, Chairman of the Board of Assessors, Chief Assessor, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=816.965s">As</a>  Chairman of the Board of Assessors, I am respectfully appearing before your honorable body tonight for the purpose of holding a public hearing to discuss the following items concerning the allocation of the fiscal year 2015 property tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=830.308s">One,</a>  to determine the residential factor to be used for fiscal year 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=835.633s">by</a>  selecting the minimum residential factor, a percentage of the total tax levy from the residential taxpayer to the commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=846.139s">This</a>  results in a lower tax rate for residential properties and a higher tax rate for commercial, industrial, and personal property taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=854.183s">Historically,</a>  the council has chosen the minimum residential factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=857.905s">If</a>  this is once again the council choice, the minimum residential factor is decimal point 899216. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=865.775s">Two,</a>  to adopt an open space discount. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=868.336s">This</a>  does not apply in the city of Medford, but a no vote is required. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=871.918s">Number</a>  three, to adopt a residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=874.459s">If</a>  adopted, owner-occupied residential properties may receive an exemption of up to 20% of the average residential value. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=881.343s">This</a>  is accomplished by shifting a portion of the tax levy from the owner-occupied residential properties to non-owner-occupied properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=888.827s">Since</a>  this shift causes a higher residential tax rate, a number of owner-occupied properties would also see an increase <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=895.388s">in</a>  their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=897.369s">Four,</a>  to adopt a small commercial exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=900.051s">If</a>  adopted, commercial properties housing a business employing 10 or less people and valued at less than a million dollars may receive an exemption of up to 10% of assessed value. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=910.555s">This</a>  is accomplished by shifting a portion of the commercial industrial tax levy from these eligible properties to another commercial and or industrial properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=919.638s">Since</a>  this shift causes a higher commercial industrial tax rate, all commercial industrial not receiving the exemption would see an increase in their tax bills. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=929.3s">As</a>  part of this hearing, it is the duty of the board of assessors to notify the council of any excess levy capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=935.283s">Fiscal</a>  year 2015, excess levy capacity is $57,657.67. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=938.826s">Table</a>  of contents. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=947.212s">Page</a>  one is the classification hearing and the residential factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=952.595s">In</a>  accordance with the Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 369 of the Acts of 1982, Chapter 797 of the Acts of 1979 Classification Amendment, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=962.216s">The</a>  city council will hold a public hearing to receive public input relative to the determination of the residential factor for fiscal year 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=969.599s">Under</a>  Massachusetts general laws, cities and towns are allowed to allocate or shift the tax burden between the various classes of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=978.183s">The</a>  residential factor determines the allocation of the real and personal property burden to shift between various classes of property. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=984.986s">By</a>  selecting a residential factor, you will also be deciding the respective tax rates for the real and personal property classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=991.522s">The</a>  Department of Revenue has authorized the adoption of two rates, one for residential and open space classes, and one for commercial, industrial, and personal property classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1000.951s">Page</a>  two is the tax levy limitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1004.735s">Last</a>  year, fiscal 2014, the levy limit was 93,175,009. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1011.525s">This</a>  year, that's a starting point for fiscal year 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1014.087s">The</a>  addition of 2.5% is $2,329,375. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1015.708s">Fiscal</a>  2015 new growth is $999,941 for a total of $96,504,325 is the 2015 levy limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1018.731s">Page</a>  three is the minimum residential factor computation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1021.253s">It</a>  shows the breakdown of the <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1040.479s">Percentage</a>  by class, residential class comprises of 88%, 1539% of the city, and the commercial industrial personal property is 11%, 11.8461%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1050.122s">Go</a>  through the calculations, you come up with a minimum residential factor of 93.281. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1055.164s">Page</a>  four is the calculation of the lowest possible residential factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1066.632s">The</a>  last year's chosen residential percentage was 78.1091%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1069.294s">Using</a>  a 150 shift would be 93.2810 with the minimum residential share, but the 150 shift is 82.2308%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1073.777s">To</a>  calculate the residential factor using a 175% shift to CIP, it's 89.9215%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1076.298s">Multiply</a>  that by the residential factor, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1094.398s">of</a>  the full and fair cash value residential percentage is 79.2693%, the lowest historical residential percentage since its first ratification, I believe it was 1980, 72.1010%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1111.873s">Page</a>  five is the classification options, starting with the single, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1117.293s">A</a>  single tax rate based on the values in the levy of $13 and one cent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1122.195s">That</a>  will be a factor of 1.00 and that will be for all classes of property going all the way down the matrix to the max at 175% which would give it projected as $11 and 70 cents for residential and 22.77 for CIP. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1136.08s">Page</a>  six. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1145.046s">is</a>  the LA-4, which is the valuation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1147.547s">Department</a>  of Revenue LA-4 form, breaking down by class of property on the left-hand side, number of parcels, and the total value for this fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1159.992s">Page</a>  seven is the valuation summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1164.434s">Fiscal</a>  year 2005, the total value of the city from last year to this year went up 9.36%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1174.743s">Next</a>  page is the breakdown by class. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1176.945s">Single</a>  families went up 8%, condominiums went up 10%, two families went up 13%, three families went up 14%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1186.613s">The</a>  twos and threes went up the most of this fiscal year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1191.397s">It</a>  reflects the mirror of 2004 values when the market went through the roof. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1197.947s">Apartments,</a>  small apartments, 48% and the larger complexes went up 18%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1204.571s">Commercial,</a>  3% and industrial at 4%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1209.033s">Page</a>  eight is a new growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1212.755s">New</a>  growth is part of the levy limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1215.196s">New</a>  growth was certified today at 999,941. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1217.777s">Page</a>  nine is the scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1222.56s">If</a>  you use the minimum residential factor, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1227.552s">what</a>  the average increase in value would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1230.734s">Average</a>  increase for a single family would be $394,500. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1234.136s">The</a>  average condominium is $294,600. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1236.038s">The</a>  average two family is $458,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1237.298s">The</a>  average three family is $545,900. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1239.94s">The</a>  average commercial industrial is $1,098,400. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1241.641s">So</a>  if the council adopted the minimum residential factor, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1255.838s">The</a>  average increase for a single family would be $128.47. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1258.399s">The</a>  average for a condominium would be $105.02. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1262.801s">And</a>  the average of a two-family would be $3.74.08. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1270.225s">Two-family.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1270.885s">Average</a>  three-family would be $5.13.16. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1272.606s">And</a>  the average commercial industrial would only see an increase of $2.90 to $2.27. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1277.809s">So</a>  again, the increase would be in the twos and three-families based on the valuation increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1286.716s">Page</a>  9-1 is the scenario for a single tax rate and the possible increases to the residential class versus the commercial class. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1300.183s">Page</a>  10 is the fiscal year 2015 tax rates from surrounding cities and towns. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1307.347s">There</a>  aren't many in yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1308.708s">It's</a>  probably two-thirds. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1310.869s">Once</a>  again, Bedford, as proposed, would be around the third or fourth lowest residential tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1317.55s">If</a>  the council adopts that page 11 is page one, two, three, four of the recap and page 12 would be the residential exemption applies to all residential owner occupied properties, non owner occupy occupied properties would be excluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1338.287s">This</a>  means any real property used for residential purposes, um, including apartment buildings in which the owner does not have a permanent residency address. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1347.04s">Lots</a>  adjacent to and owned by owner-occupied real property would also be excluded. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1353.725s">The</a>  residential exemption is a class exemption to the residential portion of the tax base only. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1358.168s">It</a>  does not have anything to do with various social economic status of a taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1364.052s">It's</a>  based on the fair cash value of real property in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1367.215s">Fiscal</a>  year 2015 assessments based on January 1, 2014 assessment date. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1373.079s">With</a>  this information in mind, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1375.049s">We</a>  must be aware that all, uh, all owner occupied properties with the total assessed value of four, four, five, 46, 400 and above will be the recipient of the exemption if it's owner occupied, but because of the higher tax rate involved will actually pay more in taxes than they would without the exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1393.295s">The</a>  local option in the residential exemption must either be approved or disapproved by a council vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1398.116s">The</a>  percentage allowable by law is anywhere up to 10 to 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1402.043s">Communities</a>  that receive special legislation can exceed the 20% maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1407.306s">If</a>  the resident owner for any reason is not granted the exemption and can prove honor occupancy on January 1, 2014, an application must be timely filed and an approved exemption will be granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1418.534s">These</a>  funds are deducted from the overlay reserves. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1421.936s">Affiliates</a>  who file it properly and timely will result in the denial of any and all exemptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1429.14s">Next</a>  page is the Department of Revenue breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1432.178s">for</a>  the residential, to explain the residential exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1436.979s">A</a>  municipality can grant a residential exemption of a dollar amount that cannot exceed 20% of the average assessed value on our residential class properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1444.761s">Communities</a>  that receive special legislation can exceed the 20% maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1450.162s">The</a>  exemption reduces by the adopted percentage, the taxable valuation of each residential parcel that is a taxpayer's principal residence. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1460.532s">Granting</a>  the exemption raises the residential tax rate and shifts the residential burden from moderately or lower valued homes to apartments, summer homes and higher valued homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1470.879s">A</a>  residential exemption is one way resort areas, Cape Cod and the Berkshires can provide some tax relief for permanent residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1480.126s">Next</a>  page is the number of communities that have adopted it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1488.452s">13</a>  communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1489.857s">We</a>  have adopted it so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1491.998s">The</a>  next page is the impact. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1494.28s">If</a>  it was adopted at 20%, 15%, and 10%, the valuation reduction for 20% would be 80,379. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1496.862s">For</a>  15% would be 60,284. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1497.402s">For</a>  10% would be 40,189. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1510.942s">And</a>  the important part to note here, as I stated earlier, was the 546, 400, 543, 800, 546, 300 would be the cutoff. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1518.926s">So</a>  anybody paying more than that would, assessed more than that would be paying more in taxes if owner-occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1525.208s">There</a>  would be 1,278 parcels that would pay more as owner-occupied for 20%, for 15% would be 13, 18, for 10% would be 12, 79 would pay more in taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1539.051s">Next</a>  page is the breakdown, uh, the actual formula and calculation to see what a number of owner occupied properties to date that we have on file is 12,032 and the various scenarios, um, the dollar and tax dollar amounts by 20, 15, and 10%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1555.574s">Next</a>  page is the residential exemption breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1559.835s">Uh,</a>  we have 15,259 residential properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1565.395s">74%,</a>  12,032 are owner occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1571.378s">We</a>  have a number of trusts that we could not ascertain ownership, 882. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1577.381s">We</a>  have 268 unknown owner occupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1581.723s">We</a>  have 2,309 non-owner occupied, and that's an estimated number. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1587.545s">And</a>  then residential land and accessory parcels are not included, 768. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1591.597s">for</a>  a total of 16 to 59 in the residential class. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1595.5s">Next</a>  page is a small commercial exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1598.322s">The</a>  various scenarios adopting yet with no

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1614.813s">I</a>  do have some questions, thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1616.561s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1617.501s">Do</a>  you want to wait, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1618.521s">Your</a>  light was on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1619.382s">Do</a>  you want to wait?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1620.242s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1620.682s">I</a>  can ask a few questions.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1622.182s">Thank</a>  you for the— Point of information, Councilor Dela Ruccio. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1625.963s">Just</a>  in the interest of public safety, the ceiling on the west side of this room is leaking, and I'd urge people not to stand on that side of the room, as it appears from this angle that a patched portion of the ceiling is beginning to sag and may give way.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1642.466s">Can</a>  you step away from that, sir? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1647.313s">Sorry</a>  to disturb, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1649.894s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1650.574s">Councilor</a>  Longo-Kerr, as everyone looks up for the sale of the book.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1653.355s">Just</a>  checking it out, OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1656.076s">Thank</a>  you, President Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1658.616s">Thank</a>  you, Ed, for the brief summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1661.877s">The</a>  local receipts not allocated, the recap, I'm not sure we went over this in detail in our subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1669.32s">Can</a>  we just go over a few of the figures on that?</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1671.78s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1673.481s">I'd</a>  probably have to defer to Finance Director Baker on that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1676.542s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1678.712s">The</a>  first would be the $300,000 difference from the penalties and interest on taxes and excises from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1686.994s">Anne,</a>  could you address that?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1692.436s">Estimated</a>  receipts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1696.097s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1703.139s">Can</a>  we just get your name and title?</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1705.499s">Anne</a>  Baker, the finance director of the city of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1708.538s">I</a>  didn't hear what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1709.298s">What</a>  item were you questioning? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1711.639s">The</a>  page before is marked as 11, so it would be like 11B, I guess.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1717.38s">Yeah,</a>  what item? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1718.921s">Penalties</a>  and interest on taxes and excises. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1721.321s">Yes,</a>  that's because there was a particularly large tax title parcel came in last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1727.643s">I</a>  think the interest on it was over $300,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1731.143s">I</a>  don't remember the actual property address that it was, but that won't be repeated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1738.162s">So</a>  it was a large new build? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1740.023s">It</a>  was a large tax title property, a large property that had been in tax title for a number of years that was redeemed.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1751.008s">And</a>  then the next one, payment in lieu of taxes, how come that is increased?</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1756.77s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1757.651s">The</a>  MVDC payment that was supposed to come in that was a new payment for fiscal 14 did not come in until fiscal 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1767.052s">So</a>  that will be budgeted for fiscal 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1769.353s">That</a>  was $166,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1770.954s">Then</a>  we will get that same amount that is due for fiscal 15, which is $166,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1775.396s">And</a>  then there's a new payment due for fiscal 15 of another $107,000.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1779.058s">And</a>  then number 10, fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1789.243s">Another</a>  significant difference.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1792.885s">Number</a>  10, the fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1793.545s">That</a>  has to do with the cable fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1798.768s">We</a>  get about $400,000 a year from Comcast, and we get about $200,000 a year from Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1806.792s">So</a>  that'll be the $600,000 budgeted for fiscal 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1810.154s">And</a>  the last year, sometimes their payments go into the wrong year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1813.335s">If</a>  they're late, they go into the wrong year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1815.276s">So</a>  last year, one of the payments went into the wrong year, went into the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1818.678s">So</a>  it was lower last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1820.039s">So</a>  that's the fee that's supposed to be used for <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1822.753s">the</a>  three public TV stations? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1825.114s">Yeah,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1826.015s">No,</a>  no, no, these aren't the TV3. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1827.716s">These</a>  are the fees that come into the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1830.317s">The</a>  franchise fee, the 3% franchise fee.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1836.921s">That's</a>  a separate fee from what we usually use for TV3? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1839.522s">That's</a>  a separate fee?</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1841.323s">Right,</a>  it's a separate fee, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1843.865s">So</a>  3%- That fee is now being kept in a separate fund when the TV3 issue is resolved, I guess.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1850.193s">So</a>  but that separate fee is coming out at three percent.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1853.355s">It's</a>  just held separately No, that does it three as a three percent fee that we get for the franchise fee is a local receipt.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1859.62s">It's</a>  always been a local receipt Point of information Councilor Penta and there's two separate accounts One that has a public access account that it has in excess of three hundred thousand dollars That's the that's the TV field TV three money, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1875.291s">And</a>  there's another account <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1877.995s">where</a>  Verizon and Comcast pay a percentage.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1880.897s">Right,</a>  and that's this account here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1881.958s">That's</a>  this account here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1882.579s">Verizon</a>  and Comcast.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1883.559s">Okay,</a>  so they are two separate accounts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1885.781s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1885.961s">They're</a>  not one.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1887.923s">Gotcha,</a>  okay, and then number 16, departmental revenue.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1893.107s">That</a>  is, the excess on that is the guaranteed portion of the new parking fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1900.293s">We're</a>  guaranteed to get at least six months worth of a $25,000 per month fee in this coming year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1909.709s">regardless</a>  of what else happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1910.87s">So</a>  we've put in that guaranteed fee as an additional excess departmental revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1916.897s">And</a>  then number 23, miscellaneous, non-recurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1920.602s">The</a>  23, that was FEMA money from the prior year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1924.186s">That</a>  won't repeat. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1926.122s">That</a>  was for potholes? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1928.344s">I</a>  can't remember. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1930.365s">FEMA?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1930.546s">I</a>  think it was FEMA.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1932.147s">That</a>  was the floods.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1933.868s">The</a>  floods, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1934.469s">We</a>  got money back from FEMA a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1936.05s">Yeah,</a>  I can't remember what that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1938.172s">It</a>  was from FEMA.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1943.656s">And</a>  then we had mentioned in subcommittee that free cash for 2000, the last fiscal year,</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1951.867s">was</a>  about, we put a million dollars into free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1954.168s">Slightly</a>  less than a million. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1955.408s">But</a>  that was almost all attributable, a large portion of that was attributable to the excess amount collected from motor vehicle excise in excess of what was budgeted. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1966.571s">I</a>  think 700,000 of that was because of that one item. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1972.732s">Motor</a>  vehicle excise number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1973.912s">What</a>  was budgeted for 14 and what was collected in 14.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1977.348s">You</a>  don't have that in front of you? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1978.469s">Well,</a>  we have number one, motor vehicle excise for $5,682,440. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1982.492s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1983.133s">So</a>  what was collected in 14 was significantly over what was budgeted in 14, which is what attributed that a large portion of that increase in free cash was attributable to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1995.876s">So</a>  we don't expect that increase in 2015? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1997.418s">No,</a>  I think it's stable. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=1999.68s">Well,</a>  we can't tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2001.701s">We</a>  really can only budget what we collected in the previous year unless we have evidence that it's going to be repeated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2011.49s">That</a>  was kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2012.191s">And</a>  what was the figure again that it went over budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2016.475s">I</a>  think it was more than half, like $600,000 maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2020.058s">I'd</a>  have to go back and get that last year's recap.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2025.363s">If</a>  I may put a motion through the chair, could we get figures by next week on how much was put into free cash in 2012, 2013, and how much has been put into free cash so far in 2000? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2046.401s">Oh,</a>  I guess you wouldn't do that until the end of 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2048.563s">You</a>  don't do that until the end of the year.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2049.764s">So</a>  just the last certification of free cash was as of June 30, 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2054.413s">So</a>  it would have been the results of operations.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2056.174s">So</a>  can you give me the last three, 2011, 2012, 2013, June figures for what was put into free cash? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2063.14s">Can</a>  we get a copy of that?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2064.361s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2065.722s">Do</a>  you have that, Mr. Clerk? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2070.666s">And</a>  so the last year, the majority, I guess, came from motor vehicle excise. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2074.709s">A</a>  large portion of it, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2076.45s">And</a>  where did the additional? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2078.432s">Do</a>  you have any idea?</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2079.633s">There</a>  was only a couple of hundred thousand dollars in unspent budgets. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2088.94s">to</a>  the best of my recollection, that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2092.022s">The</a>  rest of it was all, the rest of it was, you know, minor items and other line items of local receipts, but those were the two major items.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2099.747s">It</a>  doesn't make me too much, because the excise revenue.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2102.389s">I'm</a>  good for questions right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2104.01s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2106.172s">I</a>  have nothing to add, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2107.212s">The</a>  microphone was on, but.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2110.334s">Councilor</a>  Penta.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2112.836s">Maybe</a>  I missed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2113.757s">Can</a>  we go back to number 10? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2114.998s">Where's</a>  Anne? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2116.599s">Number</a>  10. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2118.497s">under</a>  fees, it went from 398 to 609? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2121.599s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2125.602s">Because</a>  something in the previous year, one of the items was posted in the wrong year, it was posted, it was like, sometimes they send in one check, and it's for two payments, and it went into the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2136.63s">So</a>  the 609 is what we would normally get every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2139.292s">We</a>  get about 400,000 from Comcast, and about 200,000 from Verizon.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2146.877s">So</a>  let me get that straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2149.328s">If</a>  in fiscal 2014, you had 398. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2152.35s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2154.791s">Because</a>  something from Comcast got paid early. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2160.514s">They</a>  paid us with one check right at the end of the year, and it got posted into the prior year.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2165.296s">So</a>  then that got posted, what, in 2013? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2167.357s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2172.239s">On</a>  the same train of thought, can we get, for the years 11, 12, and 13, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2178.873s">Comcast</a>  what they paid and what Verizon paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2181.274s">Do</a>  you have that, Eddie? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2183.555s">11,</a>  12, and 13 fiscal years.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2190.118s">They</a>  tend to pay them right smack at the end of the year, so sometimes they get into the line, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2195.56s">Now,</a>  it looks like, and this is like, these numbers are really tight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2199.522s">When</a>  you talk about Medicaid reimbursement, you're talking about less than $60,000? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2208.55s">You</a>  go from 446, 628 to 447.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2211.351s">That's</a>  just rounding. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2213.031s">We're</a>  assuming the same number. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2214.132s">We</a>  have no reason to suspect that it's going to be any higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2217.493s">We</a>  work with Shore Collaborative. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2219.753s">And</a>  Shore Collaborative generally gives us an estimate if they think there's something, if the federal government has changed their formula, or if they think we're going to get more money for some reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2228.396s">Generally,</a>  it's because the federal government changed their formula, or something's timing has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2233.397s">But</a>  we've had no information from Shore to indicate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2236.929s">anything</a>  extraordinary is gonna come in at 15, over and above what came in at 14.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2242.093s">And</a>  also under 23, which is miscellaneous. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2245.515s">What</a>  number? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2246.356s">Number</a>  23.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2246.916s">Yeah,</a>  that was FEMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2249.158s">That</a>  was FEMA money that came in at 14 that won't come in at 15.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2253.081s">So</a>  all our prior debt for last year's snowstorms and everything have been paid?</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2257.344s">That's</a>  right, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2259.185s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2261.887s">Can</a>  we just go back? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2265.273s">Go</a>  back to that number 10, where you have Comcast and Verizon, and you have fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2269.636s">We're</a>  going to get them for 11, 12, and 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2271.277s">And</a>  can you also give us the amount of money that was paid by the city of Medford to Channel 3 during those years, too? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2281.263s">Because</a>  I believe they have all the checks.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2283.524s">What</a>  was paid to them?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2284.705s">Yeah,</a>  to the Medford Community Cable Access.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2287.427s">Well,</a>  we've been holding all those checks.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2288.768s">No,</a>  no, you're holding it, I believe, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2291.139s">December</a>  of 2012. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2292.04s">So</a>  all of 11 and mostly all of 12, you wrote checks, the city wrote checks.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2299.246s">So</a>  you want to know what we paid to them during fiscal 11?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2301.968s">11</a>  and 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2302.828s">Fiscal</a>  11 and 12, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2303.749s">And</a>  then it stopped.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2304.67s">I</a>  think, didn't we go over this one time before?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2306.672s">No,</a>  we never got that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2307.852s">No,</a>  you gave us how much is sitting in the account, but I want to know what was paid.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2311.856s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2312.616s">In</a>  other words, during the month of 2011,</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2315.123s">Fiscal</a>  2011, fiscal 12, how much was given to TV3, or whatever they were called at that time.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2319.965s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2321.125s">You</a>  have that, Eddie? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2322.426s">Yeah,</a>  we got it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2327.188s">Any</a>  other councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2327.948s">Any</a>  questions?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2331.669s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2332.83s">Thank</a>  you, President Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2336.251s">The</a>  new growth, the 999,941, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2343.286s">What</a>  was the dollar amount on that new development, the Lumiere apartments? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2348.189s">I</a>  mean, that had to be a large chunk of that?</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2353.073s">Well,</a>  for you, Mr. President, the property is under construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2359.637s">So</a>  we pick up a part of the value this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2362.039s">We</a>  get to pick up most of it for next year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2364.08s">I</a>  know they were occupied as of, I guess, August 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2368.383s">So</a>  that would be in the apartment growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2372.521s">That</a>  would be the fourth, one, two, three, fourth line down on the second page. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2377.225s">That's</a>  part of that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2378.046s">What</a>  page are you on?</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2381.648s">New</a>  growth form. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2383.79s">Page</a>  eight.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2384.871s">Eight.</a> </p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2386.372s">The</a>  back page of it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2397.962s">So</a>  that would be... <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2407.34s">Which</a>  section would that be, Ed?</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2409.582s">That</a>  would be captured under multi-families. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2415.786s">That</a>  would be the last column.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2419.249s">New</a>  growth valuation?</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2420.73s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2421.511s">It's</a>  part of that $7 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2424.173s">Oh,</a>  gotcha. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2425.874s">We'll</a>  capture most of that next year.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2429.717s">And</a>  will we capture the new development at Station Landing Hotel? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2436.141s">Will</a>  that be next year?</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2438.03s">That's</a>  the front parcel, that's for the hotel, yeah, we will. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2443.031s">There's</a>  nothing done yet on that, just a change in the... No, I think it was actually commercial land before, so no, nothing yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2451.433s">Not</a>  until they put the shovel in the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2453.614s">So</a>  it'll be next year.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2455.234s">Next</a>  year, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2457.475s">Are</a>  there any other large developments?</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2459.475s">Yep,</a>  there's Middlesex Avenue, the apartment complex behind Wendy's, they're in the ground on that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2467.9s">Is</a>  Rivers Edge going to put another apartment building on the front parcel there? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2474.024s">Is</a>  it two now? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2474.965s">Is</a>  it two? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2476.486s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2477.487s">So</a>  there's a lot of activity in the apartment sector of real estate, not just in Medford, but all over. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2485.792s">Rents</a>  have gone up, especially in those higher end apartment complexes.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2491.436s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2497.068s">Also</a>  on Locust Street, Lumineer, they should be coming on board too.</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2500.61s">That's</a>  the one we were just talking about, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2503.232s">Locust</a>  and Middlesex, 3780 Mystic Valley Parkway.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2506.453s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2506.934s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2507.554s">So</a>  you get Lumineer, and then you're going to have the one at opposite station, standing where Mellon Bank is, and then you're going to have one further down in front of where the medical building is, and then, where's the fourth one? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2521.682s">River's</a>  Edge, Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2523.563s">No,</a>  that's what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2524.423s">River's</a>  Edge will have <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2526.285s">River's</a>  edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2526.705s">We'll</a>  have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2527.346s">And</a>  then on the front in front of where Mellon bank is on the baseball field, there's another 230 units going to be in the back at one cab at road, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2534.069s">So</a>  you can have two 30, three 30, four, you can have almost 550 more new units. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2539.131s">More</a>  than that.</p>

    <p>[L7QFU4RDE4Q_SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2540.451s">When</a>  they come online, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2541.992s">And</a>  higher end rents as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2545.294s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2547.115s">So</a>  there seems to be an incentive to build in Medford proximity location amenities.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2553.272s">We'll</a>  see how long that lasts once the casino goes in, and what that does to the traffic, and to the Wellington area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2562.56s">Mr.</a>  President, I'd just like to get back and, are we gonna stay on that page, or are we going on another? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2572.068s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2574.109s">We'll</a>  all wait until we get to the very end. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2575.811s">There</a>  might be other issues, I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2578.913s">Any</a>  other questions, motions? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2585.332s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2586.453s">Motion</a>  to approve Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2588.314s">This</a>  is a four part process. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2592.257s">Name</a>  and address for the record on the motion of approval by Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2597.901s">If</a>  you could step aside and let the gentleman up here please.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2603.065s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2605.847s">Uh,</a>  my name is John Sorrello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2608.709s">I</a>  reside at 20 Metcalfe Street, Medford and uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2613.131s">I</a>  want to say that the way this is presented here, this is an open hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2619.775s">And</a>  the people have to have input. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2621.476s">And</a>  this should be thoroughly debated. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2624.557s">Now,</a>  what happens here is that this paper put forth by the administration says, historically, the council has chosen a minimum residential factor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2635.503s">If</a>  this is, once again, the council choice, the minimum residential factor is almost 90%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2642.707s">The</a>  administration shouldn't be telling you how to vote on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2645.788s">I</a>  mean, I think you should debate this and then decide. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2648.77s">There</a>  are a whole range of factors here, beginning with the single factor, which is approximately 13 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2656.634s">I</a>  mean, yes, it's 13 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2659.775s">With</a>  the new factor put in, the rate will rise. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2667.819s">Now,</a>  the point I want to make is there is a difference between <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2674.16s">a</a>  rate and a levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2676.681s">I</a>  mean, the rate may be lower, but the levy is higher. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2683.164s">And</a>  you should not confuse those two. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2686.186s">Now,</a>  I want to ask the auditor, if we had had, over the last 28 years, if we had had a single factor, would the tax levy itself <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2701.846s">be</a>  higher or lower than it is now? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2706.467s">I</a>  wish one of them would answer that question.</p>

    <p>[L9vF4yM-fUc_SPEAKER_20]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2719.69s">As</a>  we've discussed in the past, the way the formula is constructed, when you do the <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2726.622s">residential</a>  factor shift, to shift the burden of the taxes from the residential payers to the commercial payers, it does result in a higher levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2737.224s">However,</a>  it results in a lower tax bill for the residential owners as opposed to the commercial tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2747.307s">And</a>  we went back last year, or the year before, we went back six years and determined that <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2753.183s">if</a>  we had had a single rate every year for those six years, at the end of that six year period, even though the levy was higher, in other words, the amount of taxes brought into the city from all sources, the levy is higher, the residents, not the single family, but the residents, as opposed to the commercial, the residential class, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2773.703s">still</a>  would pay less. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2775.624s">And</a>  he's trying to say, if we went back to 1988 and did it every year from 1988, would it still be lower? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2781.567s">I</a>  haven't done that exercise, but I would be willing to bet that because we do a full 175% shift from the residential class to the commercial class, I don't believe that the residential taxpayer would ever recoup what they've saved over the years by having their residential shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2799.575s">And</a>  that is what this council has approved every year, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2803.15s">since</a>  1988, they've approved it every year, because that's true. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2808.113s">And</a>  we didn't go back to do it until 1988, but we went back six years, and it proved out true then. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2812.935s">And</a>  even in some of the years when the values were down, we were doing a 200% shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2819.099s">We</a>  did a 200% shift. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2820.219s">So</a>  I don't believe that the residential taxpayer would ever have recouped the savings that were granted through this shift in all those years.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2831.785s">I'd</a>  like to respond to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2834.685s">The</a>  tax levy last year was $93 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2837.127s">Now,</a>  this year it's going to be $96.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2841.349s">There's</a>  an increase there of $3.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2845.531s">On</a>  the other hand, if we had had the single tax rate from the beginning, well, we'd be paying $6 million less. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2855.237s">The</a>  tax levy now would be $89 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2862.533s">What</a>  happens is really that the people pay the tax levy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2866.975s">I</a>  mean, that's what they are actually paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2869.316s">So</a>  what would happen really is that the payments would be less. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2874.358s">I</a>  mean, taxes would still go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2877.039s">Don't</a>  misunderstand. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2878.619s">But</a>  they would go up much less if we had a single rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2882.261s">Now,</a>  Oregon has a single rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2884.062s">Belmont</a>  has a single rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2885.702s">They</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=2886.883s">And</a>  they're prosperous.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4114.286s">It's</a>  just really unfair, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4116.427s">One</a>  year, I mean, you people are conglomerate. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4118.349s">You've</a>  got gas and electric. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4119.97s">So</a>  I mean, we have no control over anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4122.09s">And</a>  the poor ratepayers are going to pay another 27% to 36%. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4125.852s">And</a>  as the story goes, and as it's been advertised, all your bonuses of a million dollars plus went to your higher executives. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4131.314s">And</a>  I don't know how they can justify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4133.075s">It's</a>  just wrong.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4134.435s">I</a>  think they're justifying it by saying that the increase in fuel costs, but I'm not sure that.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4143.399s">You're</a>  the engineer, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4144.68s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4144.92s">From</a>  National Grid? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4145.84s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4146.04s">You</a>  want to send a separate resolution to the corporate office? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4149.182s">You</a>  could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4150.652s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Penta to send a resolution inquiring why the rates went up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4155.576s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4156.156s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4156.416s">We</a>  know the rates went up. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4157.617s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4157.937s">I</a>  just think, I think if they're going to have the rates, I just think it's unfair that they would take million dollar bonuses in their contracts.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4164.942s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4165.382s">So</a>  we'll send that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4166.583s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Penta, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4169.485s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4169.906s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4170.766s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4172.719s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4173.92s">I</a>  also want to take the opportunity to thank Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4175.601s">Murphy,</a>  because last time she appeared before the Council, I raised some concerns that I had relative to a sidewalk and a street repair between Smith Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4183.346s">and</a>  Hicks Ave., which is the subject of a resolution that I'm going to be bringing up this evening under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4188.489s">And</a>  although Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4189.49s">Murphy</a>  works, from what I can tell, in the distribution of electricity, within a week, they were out there and they had fixed the street from Hicks Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4196.754s">to</a>  Smith Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4197.315s">and</a>  repaired it into its natural and pristine condition. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4199.716s">So,</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4200.837s">Murphy,</a>  I want to thank you for your efforts on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4202.935s">because</a>  it was two days later that I drove down the street and I saw the sawhorses out there and they were ready to get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4207.98s">So</a>  thank you very much for your efforts. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4209.461s">And</a>  I trust that if you were able to do something with the 37% increase in the electrical bill, in the two or three days from now, we'd probably see it taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4217.508s">So</a>  thank you very much for your past work on behalf of this council.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4273.779s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4275.12s">I</a>  was recently contacted by a number of members of the laborers union who are working on a project in Harvard square and they reside in Medford and they walk down to Medford square city hall and they get on the bus to take that bus to Harvard square. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4289.262s">because</a>  parking is such a hassle over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4292.484s">And</a>  it's been brought to my attention that usually on Thursdays and Saturdays, the 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4297.266s">bus</a>  fails to make a stop at the City Hall stop, Mr. President, resulting in these individuals being late for work or having to take taxis to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4307.632s">I</a>  think the reason that this happens is because of the way the route's structured. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4311.094s">It</a>  has to go past, you know, the old Tony Lucci's, take a left down river, come back past City Hall Plaza, and then do the loop again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4317.647s">So</a>  maybe in the interest of time, some of these drivers are bypassing a certain stop that may or may not be busy all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4324.292s">However,</a>  it's had an impact on these hardworking individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4327.475s">So</a>  I'd like a letter to be sent out to the MVTA to be sure that their drivers are made aware of the fact that that is a stop and that that's a stop that means a lot to the residents here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4337.703s">It's</a>  a publicized stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4338.824s">It's</a>  on their schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4339.525s">It's</a>  on their route. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4340.165s">So</a>  it's a stop that they should be making.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4342.747s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4343.728s">When</a>  I sit down, I wanted to add something to that.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4398.345s">So</a>  on the motion to send that to the MBTA, all those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4404.91s">because</a>  you said Salem Street and Riverside Ave.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4407.692s">That's</a>  right, right on Salem Street, right where the power station is, there's the bench there on the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4415.678s">Oh,</a>  so on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4416.999s">It's</a>  actually on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4419.541s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4420.282s">Directly</a>  across from River Street.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4421.803s">Directly</a>  across, okay.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4422.684s">Right</a>  there, you see there's a huge, it's probably up in the air, probably about seven or eight inches from all the buses pulling in there.</p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4583.965s">Yeah,</a>  if I might, my name's Chad Adams. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4586.286s">I'm</a>  the regional construction manager for Wendy's. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4589.787s">The</a>  address is 40 General Warren Boulevard, Suite 260, Melbourne, Pennsylvania. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4598.229s">Wendy's</a>  is currently undergoing a major rebranding of its image to bring it up to the market. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4607.853s">more</a>  in line with contemporary standards and what the public is looking for in terms of not only interior modifications, Wi-Fi, more digital type of menus and formatting on the inside, but also on the outside to kind of give it a new look. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4627.749s">You're</a>  moving into the new millennium and to get it away from the old-fashioned hamburgers to the <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4633.547s">you</a>  know, with the current product offering, which is more than just hamburgers, it's salads, it's chicken, it's a wide variety of different products. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4642.07s">So</a>  we're kind of dropping the hamburger aspect off of our main tagline and just coming up with just Wendy's. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4650.852s">So</a>  this is what the, this is what the image is that we're moving actively across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4657.574s">And</a>  the signage, re-signage is, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4660.294s">is</a>  part of that, where you have the old Wendy's sign that's more of a, really like an 1890s type font that you might see in old time days, stuff to a more contemporary script, still maintaining the company logo image of the Wendy's.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4682.04s">A</a>  little Wendy.</p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4682.9s">A</a>  little Wendy. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4684.807s">But</a>  it is, and the way we're trying to set it up, it's not necessarily more is better, but strategically placing the signage where it gets the biggest bang for the buck. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4700.459s">The</a>  average sign is, I think it's 32 square feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4705.46s">including</a>  the cameo, and we've placed it strategically on the front blade element, which is this element here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4713.762s">We</a>  have another accent element in the drive-thru window, or the other side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4720.383s">And</a>  then on the non-drive-thru side, or the main vestibule, we have just the accent that kind of delineates, helps delineate the entry point into the building on the non-drive-thru side. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4735.185s">And</a>  that's the basic signage elements. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4738.226s">Now,</a>  there are some other non-illuminated signs that we're requesting as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4744.347s">They're</a>  more, I would call them, classify them more as like artwork, in that they don't say Wendy's, they don't convey the product. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4753.189s">They're</a>  basically trying to convey <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4757.275s">Quality</a>  so quality is our Difficulty <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4778.867s">service</a>  that doesn't have corners is our recipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4782.469s">And</a>  basically, the only people that can see that are people that are in the drive-thru lane, because it's protected by the two outcrops there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4791.514s">And</a>  the last sign is just basically one that says, thank you, then we hang off there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4796.397s">It's</a>  two square feet, mainly just informational, and really serves no purpose other than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4805.001s">Part</a>  of the package that people are, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4808.987s">pick</a>  up your order, you see the thank you, and you get a thank you from the service rep at the window.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4816.337s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4817.138s">Mr.</a>  President, because of the location of this restaurant and that it's not <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4824.933s">In</a>  a dense residential area, it's a standalone store that's removed, drawn back from the main avenue there quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4834.479s">I</a>  see no problem with allowing these requests, so I move approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4840.883s">On</a>  the motion of approval, Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4843.005s">Thank</a>  you, President Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4844.666s">It</a>  looks like there's 10 specific requests, and that does include your exit and enter signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4850.55s">Can</a>  you just <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4852.275s">describe</a>  to us or explain which the illumination portion of signs that possibly will be illuminated?</p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4859.197s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4860.238s">With</a>  respect to the exit and entry said directional signs and the main, you know, pylon sign, the only changes we're doing is the faces. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4869.521s">So</a>  the script matches the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4872.081s">Those</a>  will be illuminated internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4875.042s">The</a>  Wendy's signs, the Wendy's, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4881.803s">Those</a>  will be internally illuminated as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4884.986s">And</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4885.706s">The</a>  other signs, the sign that's in the little cubby here, and the thank you sign, and then this quality of the recipe sign that's over the entry, those are not illuminated.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4899.338s">So</a>  you have about, so six out of 10 are illuminated?</p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4903.882s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4905.484s">And</a>  what hours do you plan on illuminating them?</p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4908.472s">Right</a>  now, we would illuminate them during the hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4912.994s">And</a>  right now, I believe we have permission to operate till 1 o'clock in the morning.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4921.819s">By</a>  ordinance, does the illumination have to cease at 11 or 10?</p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4928.623s">I</a>  think it ceases at 1 hour after it closes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4931.264s">That's</a>  what I said. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4936.38s">I</a>  think the signs go off when you close, but the light lot can remain illuminated for one hour for safety purposes, allow the workers to get to their cars.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4946.803s">So</a>  right now the current signs are illuminated until one o'clock?</p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4951.144s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4951.864s">Okay,</a>  and you've got no complaints about that from residents?</p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4955.285s">Not</a>  that I'm aware of.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4958.626s">Okay,</a>  and we were told tonight there was a development going behind Wendy's, which is gonna be apartments. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4965.28s">Will</a>  any of these signs be facing the exterior of your building?</p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4969.422s">None</a>  of them will be facing the rear of the building, which is where that development's going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4976.425s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4983.408s">I</a>  think, yeah, that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4984.829s">That's</a>  it, Councilor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4986.469s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4986.95s">Just</a>  one quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4988.55s">Councilor</a>  Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4989.591s">Councilor,</a>  Alango brings up a good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4992.612s">Even</a>  though you're open, would you say to 1 o'clock?</p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4995.115s">That's</a>  correct.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=4997.176s">We</a>  have a situation on the parkway at Stations Landing, and because Kelly's Roast Beef is opposite the residential homes over there, she's right, they have to shut their sign down at 11 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5009.625s">That's</a>  their big sign, not the sign that's on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5013.328s">So</a>  I'm assuming that Wendy sign right there on the red brick facade, that's your biggest sign? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5020.535s">No,</a>  on the facade, the red.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5070.859s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5073.181s">Are</a>  the present signs illuminated?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5075.863s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5079.607s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5080.227s">As</a>  long as those signs aren't facing the residential homes, correct?</p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5084.531s">No,</a>  they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5087.553s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5087.934s">Which</a>  residential homes? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5090.516s">Apartments.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5095.884s">Thank</a>  you just one more question about your pylon sign that's That is gonna be changed by hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5101.588s">That's</a>  not gonna be a rotating sign.</p>

    <p>[pkk5OxKuY6w_SPEAKER_25]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5103.509s">Yeah,</a>  that's my hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5106.612s">Okay?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5106.952s">Unless</a>  you want to see a digital one.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5108.453s">Nope</a>  second the approval The way it is on the motion of the council of Dela Rousseau seconded by council Lungo-Koehn all those in favor All those opposed the ayes have it <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5118.46s">On</a>  the motion of Vice President Caraviello to take the papers in the hands of the clerk under suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5123.141s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5124.881s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5127.182s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5128.682s">Be</a>  it resolved the Office of Disability looked into the National Grid sidewalk repairs between Smith Ave and Hicks Ave to ensure ADA compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5137.564s">Be</a>  it further resolved the findings of the Office of Disability to the council and the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5142.284s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5143.545s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5146.19s">As</a>  I alluded to earlier in the meeting, National Grid is doing some gas line repairs along the stretch of Main Street between Smith Ave and Hicks Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5155.992s">And</a>  over the last couple of days, they've ripped up several sidewalk slabs. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5161.254s">However,</a>  they've ripped up sidewalk slabs on either side of the street from Smith down to Hicks. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5166.735s">which</a>  would make it very difficult for a person in a wheelchair, a person with a cane, to walk down the street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5172.76s">Also,</a>  whereas Hicks Ave is the entrance to the Columbus School, I feel as though this may pose a risk to the students that are looking to walk to school, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5180.347s">So</a>  I'm asking that our office of disability take a look and make sure that the project specifications meet ADA compliance for an accessible pathway for individuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5189.198s">who</a>  might have to traverse that road, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5191.559s">I'd</a>  also ask that her findings be reported to the school department to ensure that Mr. Belson's well aware of this safety situation down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5199.742s">I</a>  would leave it to the Office of Disability to determine whether or not they feel as though a police detail is going to be needed down there during the construction project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5206.364s">At</a>  this point in time, I don't have any inkling of understanding as to how long this project's gonna take. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5211.826s">I</a>  do know that I personally saw at least 12 sidewalk slabs on either side of the street torn up, so I don't think this is a one-day project. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5218.715s">And</a>  based upon the weather that we're going to receive and have been receiving, I don't think this is going to be something that's going to be done in a fashion that's going to be suitable for a longterm solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5226.479s">If</a>  in fact they do get out there to plug these holes. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5228.941s">Um,</a>  so I'm asking that, um, miss McLeod and our office of disability take a look and, uh, make sure that, you know, the, the contractor out there is in compliance with the federal law on the motion.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5239.327s">Uh,</a>  have the office of disability report back to the council and the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5244.249s">All</a>  those in favor, all those opposed, the ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5247.561s">offered</a>  by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5249.063s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Medford High School standout girls soccer player, Corey O'Rourke, on being named Boston Herald All-Scholastic and GBL MVP. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5259.638s">Be</a>  it further resolved, Corey O'Rourke be invited to appear before the Medford City Council to accept council commendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5266.438s">On</a>  the motion of approval, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5268.539s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5270.019s">I</a>  think that, uh, this fine scholar athletes accolades speak for themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5274.281s">Uh,</a>  she was the MVP of the greater Boston league this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5277.943s">She</a>  led her team to the GBL championship title for the girls soccer team here at Medford high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5283.465s">And</a>  she was also, um, asking Boston Herald Oskalastic, which is one of the highest accolades that, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5289.05s">a</a>  high school athlete can achieve. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5291.131s">I</a>  think that she joins the ranks of some other great Medford athletes like Sean Bates, Jake Perrazzo, and Brittany Lanzilli to be named Boston Herald All Scholastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5301.176s">So</a>  I think it would be fitting to invite her down here to receive a council accommodation and to offer her our congratulations on her great effort and great representation of the student athletes in Medford High School.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5310.441s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5311.241s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5313.752s">All</a>  those opposed, the ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5315.333s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Knight and Councilor Camuso. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5317.255s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the GBL Championship Team, Medford High School Girls Volleyball Team on their successful season. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5326.221s">Be</a>  it further resolved the team be invited to appear before the Medford City Council to accept council commendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5331.084s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5350.503s">On</a>  the motion of approval, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5352.044s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5353.205s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5354.406s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Knight and Councilor Camuso, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate the GBL Champion MHS Girls Soccer Team on their successful season. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5363.112s">Be</a>  it further resolved, the team be invited to appear before the Medford City Council to accept City Council commendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5368.896s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5451.148s">Mr.</a>  President, as an update to the proposed parking by Republic, which now appears like it's not going to take place until January of this forthcoming year, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5463.535s">There</a>  was something, and I have already responded to the chamber on this, there was something that was put out by the chamber basically talking about business parking implementation meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5474.106s">And</a>  they sent a memo out to their members, and it basically is saying that the chamber at 1 Shipyard Way in room 302 will hold four <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5483.983s">meetings,</a>  one for Hain Square, which is tomorrow night, one for the Medford Hillside in South Medford, which will be on Thursday, the 11th, and then next Wednesday, West Medford on the 17th, and then on the 18th, Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5497.406s">And</a>  then it says, next week, and this was issued out this past Friday, a representative from Republic Parking will be visiting the business areas to distribute flyers regarding the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5507.388s">Please</a>  be sure to email or call the chamber to reserve a seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5511.149s">Seating</a>  will be limited to 25 people, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5513.839s">per</a>  meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5515.08s">Well,</a>  first of all, the Chamber of Commerce has nothing to do with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5519.844s">This</a>  is a city of Medford undertaking, and this was the mayor's contract with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5525.549s">If</a>  the Chamber of Commerce now be the linchpin, so to speak, between the city and Republic, I just don't think that's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5532.816s">That's</a>  number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5534.117s">Number</a>  two, to walk around and pass out a flyer</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5539.61s">Point</a>  of information, Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5542.113s">This</a>  was requested by Republic through the Chamber of Commerce to do this, not the Chamber of Commerce asking Republicans. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5548.362s">The</a>  other way around, Republic has been trying to get out in front of this, and they're asking to do it through the Chamber of Commerce, not the opposite way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5556.332s">Good</a>  idea.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5557.188s">Well,</a>  as a point of further information, and I think you're aware of it, not everybody in the chamber was for this and agreed to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5563.997s">So</a>  let's be honest about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5565.398s">This</a>  is a City of Medford undertaking, not a Chamber of Commerce undertaking, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5571.226s">Number</a>  two, it's not an $18 million revenue enhancement for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5575.953s">The</a>  overall contract between expenditures and final payment to the city would be approximately $9 million at the end of the 10-year of the contract, not $18 million that everyone's touting and making people think that's what the city's going to get. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5589.705s">But</a>  more importantly, if they were going to have these meetings and to identify the locations, number one, why would you squirrel 25 people into a room? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5598.619s">just</a>  in case you've got an overflow of people, that's number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5601.681s">Number</a>  two, why would you be having it at 5.30 at night when a lot of the business merchants, because I spoke to them, would rather have it early in the morning because at late at night they just can't pick up and leave, and the dock of night closes their shops down if they're single proprietors. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5614.269s">Number</a>  two, and number three, and more importantly, and most importantly, if they're taking the time to walk to each one of these squares and pass out flyers, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5621.633s">they</a>  could have had enough time to find a location in each one of these four squares to accommodate them in their own particular district, so they'd be able to understand firsthand what they're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5631.8s">I</a>  just don't think it's right, Mr. President and members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5636.024s">The</a>  chamber, they do a lot of wonderful things, but this is not their ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5639.586s">This</a>  is the city of Medford's ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5641.047s">This</a>  is the mayor's ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5642.248s">It's</a>  his package with Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5644.029s">They</a>  should have figured this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5645.791s">The</a>  chamber now would be the middleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5648.353s">Cutting</a>  down whatever interferences for the mayor, I think it's wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5651.736s">And</a>  if this is Republic's way of doing it, they're going on the wrong foot. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5655.339s">And</a>  more importantly, it would have been nice if the seven councils, if at least I, I'll speak for myself, got an invitation from Republic if we would like to participate, if you would like to be there, you have any questions or concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5668.289s">Once</a>  again, the council's just excluded.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5671.731s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5674.508s">I</a>  received correspondence from the Chamber of Commerce inviting me to come, gave me a list of all the dates that it was coming, that it was going to be held and locations and times, emailed right to my inbox.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5683.871s">I</a>  did the same, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5685.392s">The</a>  Chamber of Commerce is not Republic. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5688.233s">The</a>  Chamber of Commerce is not the City of Medford and they don't profess to be the City of Medford or profess to represent the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5693.835s">The</a>  Chamber of Commerce is nothing more than a liaison that Republic is using for the purpose of selling their particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5701.017s">It's</a>  not their program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5702.318s">It's</a>  the City of Medford's program. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5703.905s">It's</a>  the taxpayers program, and they're the ones that are gonna have to take the brunt of what all this is all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5708.747s">It</a>  should be coming right here out of this city hall, out of this man, this is his program, and it should have been identified in all four sections of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5716.23s">Not</a>  in the Chamber of Commerce, and not to squirrel 25 people into a room, just in case more than 25 decided to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5722.633s">What</a>  are they gonna do, tell them that they can't come?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5725.374s">Point</a>  of information, Vice President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5726.975s">If</a>  there are more than 25 people attending one, they will plan to schedule another meeting to accommodate everyone.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5733.965s">Well,</a>  there in itself is the crux of the matter, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5737.109s">If</a>  more than 25 come, why would you even wait to have more than 25 come? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5740.933s">Why</a>  wouldn't you have found a spot ahead of time that can accommodate up to 100, every one of the four locations?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5746.499s">Again,</a>  this is the republic asking the chamber to</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5749.562s">Well,</a>  then the chamber, if they had any brains, they'd have been able to figure this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5753.005s">And</a>  you're a member of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5754.065s">I'm</a>  a member of the chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5754.786s">You</a>  serve on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5755.666s">You've</a>  got a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5756.247s">You</a>  can speak up.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5756.987s">I'm</a>  only one vote on that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5758.508s">Well,</a>  you can speak up about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5759.909s">I'm</a>  only one vote on that board. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5761.511s">Well,</a>  maybe you should speak up a little louder. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5763.812s">I</a>  speak up on multiple boards.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5764.933s">Councilor</a>  De La Rosa, you're a member of the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5769.276s">I</a>  just think...</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5771.895s">should</a>  be placed under some sort of cross-examination by the consular. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5775.376s">And</a>  I'm dreadfully sorry that the world doesn't revolve to his liking.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5780.718s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5781.018s">You</a>  don't have to be dreadfully sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5782.799s">You</a>  should just stand up and speak up and take a position and that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5786.08s">And</a>  the position is very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5787.58s">If</a>  you're a member of the chamber and you know that there are four sections of the city that are going to be affected, why would you want to put 25 people into a room and you had more than 25? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5795.222s">We'll</a>  have to set the time for another time. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5797.363s">Why</a>  would you just find the location and the area that they're going to be? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5800.305s">Point</a>  of information.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5801.105s">I</a>  believe, I believe consulate Dello Russo voted in favor of a resolution asking Republic to come to each individual business district here in the city to present an information session with the business owners and the residents thereof. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5814.373s">He</a>  voted in support of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5815.874s">The</a>  resolution was brought forward maybe seven weeks ago and it passed six to one. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5819.616s">Um,</a>  so I think that when you say have a voice, consulate Dello Russo did have a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5823.34s">He</a>  used his voice here as a councilor to speak about his position on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5826.482s">What's</a>  going on in the Chamber of Commerce and this private organization and the private decisions that they make really has no effect on what we do here as a council.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5833.467s">I</a>  disagree with you, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5834.607s">This</a>  is over and above. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5835.448s">It's</a>  a private entity.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5836.528s">It</a>  might be a private entity, but it is not over and above. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5839.07s">This</a>  is not the Chamber's issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5841.512s">This</a>  is the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5842.913s">This</a>  is the Mayor's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5844.394s">This</a>  is the contract.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5845.294s">Maybe</a>  the Chamber members... So is this about the Chamber or about your feelings towards the Mayor?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5850.127s">No,</a>  it's neither of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5851.068s">It's</a>  the idea that this is a City of Medford contract, is it not? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5855.21s">Is</a>  it not a City of Medford contract, Councilor Dello Russo?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5857.812s">It's</a>  a City of Medford contract, but Republic.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5859.953s">I'm</a>  sorry things don't go the way you'd like them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5862.214s">Well,</a>  I'm sorry things don't go your way all the time as well, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5865.756s">And</a>  maybe if you were more active, you'd have an understanding, and if you walk the streets, and you listen to the people... Councilor, enough of the cheap shots.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5873.0s">That's</a>  a cheap shot saying... <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5876.121s">All</a>  of this.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5876.982s">It</a>  is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5877.363s">It's</a>  in your mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5878.024s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5878.384s">Well,</a>  no, that's in your mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5879.686s">It</a>  isn't in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5880.727s">I've</a>  walked the streets and I talked to these business people and they would like to have had it in a particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5887.266s">Listen,</a>  who's taking the cheap shot? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5888.648s">You</a>  and me right now.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5889.528s">No,</a>  some of them, some of them specifically said that they're happy about these meetings and they're glad.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5893.132s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5893.353s">And</a>  there's some of them that don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5894.574s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5894.994s">And</a>  it goes both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5895.935s">Well,</a>  it's a private entity that's inviting them, not the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5897.918s">Well,</a>  it's a private entity that's writing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5899.459s">But</a>  unfortunately the private entity is doing business with the city as part of a public contract and public dollars are involved and it's just my, it's just my, Hey, listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5907.867s">It's</a>  my opportunity, it's my personal opinion, and that's what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5910.469s">I'm</a>  making my opinion, and Councilor De La Rosa doesn't like it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5913.011s">I'm</a>  not going to apologize for him not liking it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5914.932s">He</a>  doesn't like half the things I do, and I don't like half the things he does. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5917.914s">So</a>  what difference does it make? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5919.235s">That's</a>  our right, that's our freedom of speech. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5921.157s">That's</a>  our way of saying what we want to say on a subject matter that means something, and this means something to me, because I hear the people talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5927.601s">And</a>  now what are we going to do, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5929.963s">When</a>  it snows out, we haven't even figured out who is going to plow the sidewalks where these meters are. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5935.027s">Is</a>  it going to be the city's responsibility? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5937.048s">Is</a>  it going to be republics? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5939.07s">And</a>  what happens when a senior citizen or a handicapped person can't get to the meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5943.873s">These</a>  are issues that need to be discussed and be brought out publicly to have a discussion on. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5949.077s">Still</a>  not to have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5950.238s">And</a>  they still haven't been able to identify the 932 parking spaces. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5954.12s">That's</a>  still up in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5955.702s">So</a>  what did we accomplish? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5956.983s">And</a>  what has been accomplished by having republic come in when these haven't even been finalized?</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5961.926s">This</a>  is, like Councilor Dello Russo said, and Vice President Caraviello, this is a meeting of a private entity known as the Chamber of Commerce, who is doing outreach for their members, and I applaud them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5973.741s">So,</a>  do you have a motion, Councilor?</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5975.803s">I</a>  just want to let the people know that this particular meeting, these particular meetings, I feel, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5981.715s">should</a>  have been in the four particular areas rather than in the chamber's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5985.097s">They</a>  could have still been the sponsor, but they could have had places where more than 25 people could have come. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5990.181s">And</a>  if they had it early in the morning rather than later at night, that's what the calls were that I got from people. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=5996.625s">If</a>  they were going to go, they would have prefaced being there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6000.367s">I</a>  would encourage you to put them all together in a room.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6002.749s">Most</a>  people that were asked by the chamber for the evening meeting versus the day meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6007.737s">Well,</a>  maybe that's the people you spoke to as compared to the people I spoke to.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6011.639s">And</a>  we had this conversation Sunday.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6013.059s">Through</a>  the chamber, most people had preferred the evening meeting after work hours.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6017.261s">When</a>  you say through the chamber, you're talking about the chamber, I'm talking about the business people. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6020.322s">There's</a>  a lot of business people, Rick, that aren't chamber members.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6024.284s">Through</a>  the people that were contacted, they preferred the later hour when it was more convenient for them, because most of them open at eight o'clock in the morning, and they'd rather be there in the morning.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6035.02s">Well,</a>  they can't be there at 530 at night either, so what do they do?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6037.501s">Most</a>  of them are closed by that time.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6038.841s">Well,</a>  I'm going to disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6040.301s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6041.101s">Again,</a>  listen, again, this is, this is Republic asking the chamber to help them out and help facilitate this to the business areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6052.024s">This</a>  is not the chamber doing it on their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6054.424s">This</a>  is, it's part of the work that the chamber does. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6059.154s">This</a>  is outreach.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6060.675s">And</a>  I know there's a lot of businesses out there that are not members of the chamber that were also invited. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6066.381s">So</a>  this isn't chamber only specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6068.803s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6069.884s">Um,</a>  it seems like Republic's willing to do some outreach work, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6074.769s">If</a>  they're willing to come and meet.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6077.528s">The</a>  Republicans, they're trying to do some type of, I've seen some of the things that the Republicans are looking to do with the businesses, with people that do get tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6088.87s">They're</a>  trying to work with the businesses on their website to do different things with people who do get tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6096.111s">And</a>  one more last thing, handicapped people don't pay the meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6103.152s">They</a>  don't have to worry about putting money in by law.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6110.085s">I</a>  mean, Mr. President, it's clear, I think, that republic's willing to do some outreach work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6114.831s">We've</a>  seen them at community day. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6116.313s">We've</a>  seen them at a number of events that have gone on that the city sponsored. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6119.597s">Now</a>  we're seeing them take the efforts to go and meet with the chamber of commerce, not on one night, not on two nights, not on three nights, but on four nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6125.484s">So</a>  I think that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6128.565s">I'd</a>  be remiss if I didn't say that maybe we should just call Republic and ask them to put something together. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6133.332s">And</a>  if we have any constituents that have contacted us, we can have the same type of info session in room 201 or room 207.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6138.099s">I</a>  think we'd be more than able to have a meeting with, I think Republic would be more than happy to come down to a council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6144.623s">to</a>  answer any questions.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6145.464s">I</a>  mean, they've been there, they've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6146.805s">I</a>  think they've answered our questions for the most part.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6148.787s">I</a>  think there'd be more than anybody to come down here and answer any questions.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6154.231s">I'm</a>  already working, I'm putting my own meetings together.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6156.934s">In</a>  terms of their track record and what they've shown us that they're willing to do, I don't think that there'd be any reason to think that they wouldn't be willing to continue to do such. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6164.88s">I</a>  think that it might make sense if we can reach out to <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6168.604s">find</a>  out who the City of Medford liaison is, and then we can deal with these things on a case-by-case basis with that individual directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6174.408s">If</a>  we needed to put them in a room with 10 or 11 or 13 people, then so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6177.671s">If</a>  business owners are calling you and they need answers, I don't think that this gentleman is going to be too afraid to come up here and give answers to the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6184.816s">The</a>  contract is signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6185.657s">He</a>  is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6188.159s">At</a>  the end of the day, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6189.987s">He's</a>  here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6190.247s">We're</a>  going to have to live with him. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6191.328s">So</a>  I don't think that they're going to want to start off on the wrong foot and create a relationship like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6196.551s">I</a>  really think that based on what they've shown us already, that they're willing to be a part of the conversation, to come in and to talk and to answer the questions and to show us how they want to implement this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6205.896s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, you know, I'd certainly be interested to find out what the contact information is for the liaison for Republic so that I can go and do some of that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6216.378s">Um,</a>  I don't need an official action to this council to get that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6218.881s">I</a>  can make the, make the full call and do it my own. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6221.644s">Um,</a>  however, I think that that might make a little bit more sense than, than, you know, it'll get us some results. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6227.37s">It'll</a>  bring us, it'll bring us to the end of the road yet.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6229.792s">And</a>  the mayor, um, we'll be doing outreach in several different ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6235.19s">once</a>  all the information is readily available. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6238.093s">City</a>  hasn't started the process yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6240.175s">Councilor</a>  Pentzer and the gentleman at the podium.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6241.976s">What</a>  we're talking about, Mr. President, is everything that was discussed back in October. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6245.78s">October</a>  1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6248.245s">as</a>  reported, and it was a council meeting just prior to October 1st, where we had these discussions of having them come forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6255.107s">And</a>  it was your comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6256.167s">It</a>  was your comment at that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6258.268s">And</a>  you said that this whole parking scenario is going to be a tough pill for the business people to swallow. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6263.47s">That's</a>  what you said. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6264.85s">Well,</a>  it's right here.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6266.37s">I</a>  have it right here.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6268.831s">No,</a>  he said it's a tough pill. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6269.992s">It's</a>  going to be a tough pill to swallow. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6271.652s">That's</a>  your quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6272.272s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6273.273s">It's</a>  on the tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6274.053s">It's</a>  on your quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6275.02s">And</a>  with that being said, and recognizing then from October to now, from October to now, there's been nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6280.623s">And</a>  a lot of the people in the business districts don't know who's gonna be getting these meters, who's not gonna be getting them.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6285.546s">That's</a>  the purpose of the meetings, to help to inform them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6289.929s">If</a>  the mayor wants to have private meetings and separate meetings, I'm sure he'll have them, or maybe that's in his plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6296.633s">I</a>  can't speak for the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6299.555s">The</a>  chamber's trying to do their part to help everyone</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6303.64s">Well,</a>  maybe it would have been nice if the council was advised and maybe we had an opportunity to see what was going on rather than have to get an invite or hear something that the chamber's sponsoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6315.027s">And</a>  if you want to tag along, you can come along.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6318.008s">Those</a>  meetings are open to everyone that wants to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6320.79s">There's</a>  no conspiracy here.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6321.951s">This</a>  is public health. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6322.551s">I</a>  didn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6323.171s">Nobody</a>  said that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6325.693s">Again,</a>  it's here to stay. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6328.594s">It's</a>  here and they're trying to make the best out of it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6332.023s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Sorrell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6333.483s">John</a>  Stirola, 20 Metcalf Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6336.244s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6338.525s">I</a>  have an opinion on this matter, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6340.905s">I</a>  think the council should never, never have given the mayor permission to sign a 10-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6348.227s">That's</a>  the one power they had. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6350.687s">They</a>  gave it up easily, as usual. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6354.968s">He</a>  already had the power to sign a three-year contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6358.609s">And</a>  in that event, the damage would have been minimized. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6363.005s">I</a>  don't have a crystal ball, but I do want to make a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6367.869s">The</a>  administration and the people of this city are going to regret that paid parking was ever installed.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6378.137s">Name</a>  and address for the record, sir.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6380.272s">John</a>  Byers, 22 Alston Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6383.273s">Just</a>  a point of context here in this whole conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6387.573s">This</a>  was the mayor's veiled attempt at making brownie points after being called out on TV three times by the citizens and having Channel 5 and Channel 7 come down and their investigators do reports on how poor the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6407.444s">takes</a>  care of its parking problems. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6410.186s">And</a>  the mayor did this because he got thoroughly embarrassed and he tried to throw this council under the proverbial bus saying that this council did not want to do anything to curb the parking problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6424.776s">So</a>  this is his way of saying, screw you Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6427.799s">I'm</a>  doing this without your permission.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6430.08s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6435.76s">Councilor</a>  Penta's motion receive a place on file.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6440.421s">John.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6443.402s">One</a>  last thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6444.022s">I</a>  think you forgot to mention and that whole commentary that you just talked about when channel seven came. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6449.103s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6450.083s">What</a>  was the comment that the mayor made when they were asked him about the public park?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6453.124s">He</a>  said the city council will not allow us to do what we need to do to help the parking problem.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6460.266s">I</a>  think he said, I think he said, John, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6462.67s">that</a>  the council did not put the money in the budget for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6465.491s">And</a>  that's absolutely not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6467.352s">Which</a>  is totally not true. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6468.893s">This</a>  council each and every year has been supportive of them.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6471.514s">And</a>  just to make a further point, after seeing that report, I called Hank Philippi Ryan and I spoke to someone at Channel 7 and made the point to them that the mayor totally had lied to Hank Philippi Ryan in making <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6487.32s">And</a>  I pointed out that the mayor threw the council under the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6492.387s">I</a>  told him, Councilor Michael J. Marks has been asking for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6499.014s">about</a>  getting a comprehensive parking program in the city, and every time he is blocked by this mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6507.101s">Now,</a>  the mayor, as I said, was called out three times within less than a year's time by Channel 5. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6514.207s">When</a>  Channel 5 was called down about the <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6523.015s">the</a>  inaccurate information being given about odd even parking during the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6527.819s">And</a>  then the parking program and the, oh God, I'm losing my train of thought here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6540.809s">The,</a>  oh.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6543.771s">Relax,</a>  take it, it'll come.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6554.283s">Basically</a>  what I'm saying is what has to happen is this council as a whole has to proverbial grow a set, stand up to the smear and say no, we're not going to allow this. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6567.367s">The</a>  last time we had parking meters in this city, there were problems and we ended up pulling them out. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6572.549s">Now</a>  the smear wants to throw us back into the stone age again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6576.65s">with</a>  parking meters. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6577.63s">That</a>  isn't the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6578.81s">The</a>  way to go is to have a comprehensive parking program, and that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6583.791s">What</a>  I was trying to say is about the permitted parking, by the way. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6587.812s">That's</a>  what I was going to mention, the fact that the permitted parking and people are being told after they have paid their permits to park.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6603.035s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6603.916s">All</a>  in the motion receive and place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6607.752s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6608.352s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6609.314s">We</a>  have two sets of records. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6610.816s">Councilor...</a>  Suspension of the rules.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6621.058s">Good</a>  evening, Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6623.719s">I</a>  wanted to inform the public that yesterday I attended a press conference the mayor had with a Comcast representative, Sheila Willett, very nice woman, speaking about a program, an old program that Comcast had. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6636.502s">It's</a>  seven years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6638.003s">They</a>  put it aside and now it's back. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6639.403s">It's</a>  called Every Block. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6641.164s">Now</a>  you can go on the city website and see Every Block and get the press release.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6645.525s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6645.925s">One</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6647.385s">Can</a>  you gentlemen take the conversation outside please so we can hear the <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6650.705s">The</a>  guy at the podium.</p>

    <p>[Joe Viglione]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6652.347s">Thank</a>  you so much, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6654.129s">Council</a>  President, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6656.871s">This</a>  Everyblock, you can do a web search on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6660.255s">I</a>  think it's everyblock.com, but search it to make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6663.238s">And</a>  the city website does have information. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6665.04s">No,</a>  it's intriguing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6667.856s">The</a>  woman from Comcast asked if there were any questions, and no one asked a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6671.479s">So</a>  I said, well, we already pay Comcast for Peg Access, and we're not getting the product. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6678.003s">So</a>  can you elaborate on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6679.725s">And</a>  the mayor went up, and Councilor Caraviello was there, along with Tim Kelly from Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6686.009s">And</a>  the mayor said, next week, there will be a press conference, and that he is going to give us an access TV station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6694.528s">So</a>  I want the council to hold the mayor at his word. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6698.693s">It</a>  would have been nice if that press conference yesterday was held in Alden Chambers, and I would hope the city council can respectfully ask the mayor to start having more public hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6709.185s">That</a>  videotape I did of the parking meter video <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6713.897s">That</a>  was an important meeting with people out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6717.019s">It</a>  would have been great to have it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6719.061s">These</a>  chambers are wonderful, hallowed halls, and I think that they would serve this city well. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6724.485s">So</a>  anyway, that conference was about every block. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6729.708s">Next</a>  week, we're going to have a preface conference, according to the mayor, on his new proposal for an access TV station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6737.454s">Please,</a>  City Council, hold him to his promise. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6740.536s">I</a>  don't want to hear him go back on it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6742.69s">There'll</a>  be an announcement on the forthcoming.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6747.292s">I</a>  do have a comment on this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6748.752s">John</a>  Byers, 22 Wall Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6752.573s">This</a>  idea of the mayor saying there's going to be an access station, there has to be one thing made clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6757.514s">We</a>  will not accept any of the mayor's cronies running the access station, that being a Mr. Jack Dempsey. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6764.675s">We</a>  need to have someone that is not involved in the mayor's circle.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6769.016s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6769.916s">I</a>  don't think we need to name the gentleman by name over here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6772.837s">That's</a>  inappropriate.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6774.371s">Well,</a>  I'm sorry you don't like that, but we can't have people like that running the access station, because basically what will end up happening- The same thing can be said about a number of people, you know what I mean, Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6785.716s">I</a>  just don't think it's conducive to a positive debate.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6788.077s">The</a>  mayor will be appointing people that he feels fit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6793.207s">We</a>  can't have any of that because if that happens, then he'll have control of the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6799.39s">And</a>  people like me who have been outspoken against him will not be allowed on that station.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6804.673s">He'll</a>  keep people that have... Mr. Baez, you'll always be allowed at the access station if you're a member in good standing. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6811.797s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6812.277s">You</a>  will always be allowed at the Medford access station. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6815.559s">If</a>  you are a member in good standing, no one's going to keep you out.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_22]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6818.78s">Well,</a>  I, I'm not saying, I'm not saying that I'm going to be kicked out, but there'll be stringent rules put against me because I've been outspoken against him. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6826.043s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6827.124s">Thank</a>  you, sir.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6829.425s">The</a>  records of November 25th were passed the council.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6832.526s">Mr.</a>  President on page number two 12, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6838.786s">under</a>  resolution 14754, amendment number C. It's by amendment, it says amended by Councilor Panter and Councilor Longo-Curran, that OCD report back on what has information they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6854.315s">I</a>  don't know what that means, it doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6859.518s">Well,</a>  let's go to page, go page 12, 14754, number C. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6867.608s">And</a>  then we go to, you got it? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6873.312s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6874.632s">I</a>  don't know what the correction, I don't know what the term, the sentence doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6880.356s">No,</a>  I'm telling you that needs to be corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6886.52s">I'm</a>  reading section C here, it doesn't make sense, the second line. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6889.882s">I</a>  don't know what you have, and you have to go back to the tape and look at it, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6894.524s">You</a>  take a look at it? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6896.005s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6897.417s">And</a>  then we go to page 213, 14759, and under A, after the word but, that doesn't make sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6914.943s">It</a>  says, vended by myself of a street, if your street was not swept, but were tagged, ticket and towed, <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6922.449s">I</a>  don't know if it's a resident or if it means your car. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6925.11s">I</a>  don't know, I don't know what it's supposed to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6926.531s">You're</a>  gonna have to go back and look at the tape.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6928.352s">That's</a>  the one you said to go to the mayor and take care of the tickets.</p>

    <p>[Robert Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6931.654s">Yeah,</a>  but it doesn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6933.775s">It</a>  says, if your street, if your street was not swept, but were tagged, ticketed, and towed, is it your car or a resident was tagged? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6945.341s">I</a>  don't know, maybe it's a resident's car. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6947.723s">Maybe</a>  those are the appropriate words that have to be put in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6950.264s">I</a>  don't know what but were tagged means. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6952.793s">What's,</a>  what's Eddie just, just go, just the sentence. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6958.935s">It</a>  doesn't make sense to take a look at the tape and we can figure out exactly what it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6965.737s">So</a>  we're going to table those still. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6968.017s">No,</a>  I have no problem as long as he corrects them. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6969.778s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6970.138s">It's</a>  just, it's grammar, but it doesn't, it's not making any sense on the motion with further clarification of approval.</p>

    <p>[Paul Camuso]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6978.39s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6979.311s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6980.011s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6980.632s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6981.492s">The</a>  records of December 2nd were passed to Vice President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6985.795s">How</a>  did you find them? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6990.478s">On</a>  the motion of approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6992.779s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6993.8s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6994.08s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6994.841s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6995.541s">On</a>  the motion of Council Appendix for adjournment. <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6998.243s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6998.924s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6999.024s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/gvpawZbv1GQ&t=6999.724s">The</a>  ayes have it.</p>
