00:00:29,798 --> 00:00:35,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everyone and welcome to Method Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:36,426 --> 00:00:44,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I am John Petrello and the purpose of this program is to give Method citizens facts and information

3
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:47,204
[SPEAKER_02]: to help you make informed choices.

4
00:00:47,965 --> 00:01:13,878
[SPEAKER_02]: But before I do introduce today's guests, I just want to take a moment, I want to extend an invitation to any member of the Medford City Council, or any member of the Medford School Committee, who is a council member, school committee member, or running for re-election, we're giving you the opportunity once again to appear on Medford Happenings to share

5
00:01:14,563 --> 00:01:19,445
[SPEAKER_02]: your positions and your thoughts on current issues facing the city of Medford.

6
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,526
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very simple to do.

7
00:01:21,606 --> 00:01:28,049
[SPEAKER_02]: You can reach us at MethodHappenings02155 at gmail.com.

8
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:37,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, MethodHappenings02155 at gmail.com if you'd like to join us on the show.

9
00:01:37,894 --> 00:01:39,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we'll get to the important stuff.

10
00:01:40,962 --> 00:02:00,514
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a warm welcome, special guests, they've both been on the show before, both know Method inside and out, Milva McDonald and Ron Giovino, who are members of the Charter Study Committee, and we thank you for that.

11
00:02:02,435 --> 00:02:04,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

12
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:07,818
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get right into it.

13
00:02:09,435 --> 00:02:11,357
[SPEAKER_02]: So question one, here we go.

14
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:28,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Proposed charter has gone through required city and state review processes, and it will be represented to the citizens of Method to vote on in this coming November election.

15
00:02:29,352 --> 00:02:35,618
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you tell the audience, are there any updates to the proposed charter

16
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:44,007
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, will the proposed charter be reviewed regularly going forward?

17
00:02:46,388 --> 00:02:49,488
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, John, for that question, and thanks for having us here.

18
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:55,130
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, this is a very, very important piece that'll be on the ballot.

19
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,652
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of updates, which hopefully we'll get to as we continue our discussion today.

20
00:03:03,405 --> 00:03:15,309
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as review, the committee thought and the council and the mayor agreed that four decades of waiting for another review is unacceptable.

21
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:27,252
[SPEAKER_00]: So written into the charter is a requirement for the charter to be reviewed every 10 years, same way this one was.

22
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:44,603
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, just because it's brand new and because we want to encourage people to really adopt the use of the charter, the first charter review is mandated to happen within the first five years once the charter has been established.

23
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:54,605
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely a lot of emphasis on making sure that this is a living, updatable document.

24
00:03:55,642 --> 00:03:58,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, Ron, thank you for that answer.

25
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:15,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing I keep hearing, I'm sure you are hearing it, everyone's talking about, I guess there's an expansion in the number of Councilors going from seven to 11 members.

26
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you like sort of dig into that, let us know, let the people know exactly what's going on with that?

27
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:23,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, sure.

28
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,911
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take that question.

29
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

30
00:04:25,551 --> 00:04:31,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, we currently have an all at large council of 7 members.

31
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:37,739
[SPEAKER_01]: And the proposed charter would switch that to hybrid ward representation.

32
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Since the city has 8 wards, that means we would have 8 ward Councilors, 1 from each ward.

33
00:04:44,176 --> 00:04:46,458
[SPEAKER_01]: and three at-large Councilors.

34
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:50,062
[SPEAKER_01]: Hybrid ward representation is standard practice.

35
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:54,286
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually one of the only cities in the state not to have it.

36
00:04:56,448 --> 00:05:00,612
[SPEAKER_01]: And our council is also the smallest council in the state for a city of our size.

37
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:10,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So that switch to hybrid ward representation will bring the size and composition of our council in line with other councils in the state.

38
00:05:11,866 --> 00:05:21,749
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, we looked at a lot of things when we had this discussion, but some wards of the city have been significantly underrepresented in recent decades.

39
00:05:21,809 --> 00:05:26,390
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, two wards, wards one and four, have had no Councilors come from them.

40
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:33,546
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's interesting is that voter turnout actually often correlates with the most highly represented wards.

41
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:48,594
[SPEAKER_01]: So ward representation will ensure that every ward has a representative, and hopefully open the door to more people running for office, because running for office at large is very difficult.

42
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:54,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's more manageable to really focus on a ward and focus on that number of people.

43
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's a lot easier.

44
00:05:57,008 --> 00:06:08,295
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to cost some people, if you don't have a lot of money, it's going to give you the ability to actually run and maybe even for a ward.

45
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,056
[SPEAKER_00]: John, if I could just add quickly to that.

46
00:06:11,316 --> 00:06:18,741
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one of the focuses of what we heard from the citizens, and that's really what we were, the listening board for the citizens,

47
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:27,512
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of neighborhoods, a lot of wards who are underrepresented and don't really get engaged in the process.

48
00:06:28,092 --> 00:06:39,436
[SPEAKER_00]: So we think that giving them the ability, not only does it allow for, you know, when folks want to campaign, they have to decide that, first of all, the job's going to take a lot of their time.

49
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:42,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondly, it's very expensive to run a campaign citywide.

50
00:06:44,077 --> 00:06:47,138
[SPEAKER_00]: This affords them the opportunity to talk to their neighbors,

51
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,956
[SPEAKER_00]: gives the neighbors a chance to say that, you know, hey, look at that.

52
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,378
[SPEAKER_00]: There's my city council walking down the street saying good morning to me.

53
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:04,807
[SPEAKER_00]: So our hope is that this not only improves the efficiency of the city, but allows us to energize those in the community who just

54
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:08,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not engaged.

55
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,271
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping that this is a very important issue.

56
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:14,072
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an issue that people talked about.

57
00:07:14,512 --> 00:07:16,213
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the priorities.

58
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:19,674
[SPEAKER_00]: This was the most battled of all the issues.

59
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:29,838
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally think it's really built with everybody in mind, caring for everybody's opinion, and also will energize the community.

60
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:30,819
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

61
00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:33,000
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to throw this in there.

62
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to throw a monkey wrench in.

63
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:45,952
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought at one time the current city council, as it sits, was very much in favor of this and pushing it.

64
00:07:46,892 --> 00:07:53,574
[SPEAKER_02]: But now it seems like, I don't know, I'm hearing that they're not in favor anymore.

65
00:07:53,594 --> 00:07:56,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, can you comment on that?

66
00:07:57,035 --> 00:07:58,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is there anything you want to add to that?

67
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, am I correct in saying that?

68
00:08:03,124 --> 00:08:05,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think the current city council voted for it.

69
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:09,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, all the ones that are running for re-election voted yes.

70
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:14,271
[SPEAKER_01]: So I take that as a support.

71
00:08:14,771 --> 00:08:14,851
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

72
00:08:14,931 --> 00:08:15,551
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

73
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:16,212
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

74
00:08:16,312 --> 00:08:18,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to make sure.

75
00:08:19,836 --> 00:08:35,035
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so will the city council, another subject that keeps coming up, will they have or what new powers under the revived charter will they have?

76
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:42,813
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so the actual form of government, which is a mayor council form is not changing.

77
00:08:44,054 --> 00:08:46,736
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but there are a couple of things that will shift.

78
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:53,822
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, right now, the mayor has sole authority to appoint members of Medford's boards and commissions.

79
00:08:55,322 --> 00:09:05,386
[SPEAKER_01]: The boards and commissions that are mostly volunteer bodies, but they're really important for the vibrancy and the operation of many aspects of the city.

80
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:12,108
[SPEAKER_01]: The city council will have a chance to be involved in that process, and that will make that process a little more collaborative.

81
00:09:13,748 --> 00:09:15,009
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one thing.

82
00:09:16,169 --> 00:09:16,909
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.

83
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:18,250
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds good.

84
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,351
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess the next question,

85
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:28,647
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you tell us about how the new charter, how will it impact the office of the mayor?

86
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if I can't address that.

87
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:47,718
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the key things that came about from almost three years now of listening in meetings and negotiating and debates, we voted to have the mayor's term go to four years.

88
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:56,701
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what, you know, that's what we heard back from everybody, that a mayor has to run a lengthy campaign.

89
00:09:57,762 --> 00:10:00,363
[SPEAKER_00]: They have two years to put together an administration.

90
00:10:01,184 --> 00:10:05,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, during those two years, they're building up for the next campaign.

91
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:11,269
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought it was fair to say that the four years gives the mayor a chance to build an organization.

92
00:10:12,105 --> 00:10:17,090
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, that, uh, supports her agenda and what's best for the citizens.

93
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:26,578
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows her, in my opinion, to hire staff members who are not worried about a two year term, a two year job.

94
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:30,482
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it will, I think it will increase the quality of the candidates she'll have to choose from.

95
00:10:30,622 --> 00:10:33,184
[SPEAKER_00]: He or she will have to choose.

96
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:36,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but you know, also the mayor has, um,

97
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:42,099
[SPEAKER_00]: During the negotiation, she's stepping down as the chairperson of the school committee.

98
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,727
[SPEAKER_00]: She'll still be a member of the school committee, and that clearly came from the

99
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:49,635
[SPEAKER_00]: subcommittee meetings on school committees.

100
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:51,696
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was a big step.

101
00:10:51,756 --> 00:10:56,139
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually a key negotiating point to get this thing passed.

102
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:59,522
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's certainly the four-year term.

103
00:10:59,602 --> 00:11:04,425
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the term limit now for the mayor is 16 years.

104
00:11:04,485 --> 00:11:08,868
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's four terms is the maximum.

105
00:11:08,888 --> 00:11:11,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are two major, major issues.

106
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:19,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that sounds good, four-year term for the mayor, but there's still a term limit, 16 years.

107
00:11:19,504 --> 00:11:23,270
[SPEAKER_02]: For that, you're not gonna be able to run again.

108
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:28,649
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so we got the council, we got the mayor.

109
00:11:28,849 --> 00:11:32,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this charter have any changes involving the school committee?

110
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:33,630
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

111
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,131
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it does.

112
00:11:36,331 --> 00:11:44,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And the subcommittee on school committee was one of the most engaging with the citizens in terms of being part of the debate.

113
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:54,153
[SPEAKER_00]: The attempt to go ward representation didn't work for the school committee because of the size.

114
00:11:55,954 --> 00:11:59,697
[SPEAKER_00]: The ward, so we've compromised to create four districts.

115
00:12:00,978 --> 00:12:04,200
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're combined districts, they're listed on the charter.

116
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:12,927
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll allow a similar attitude that we had for the ward representation, but we clearly heard that seven members

117
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:21,430
[SPEAKER_00]: is the maximum they wanted to have to function in the best interest of the schools.

118
00:12:22,471 --> 00:12:34,840
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a two-year limit, but this is the same theory behind getting the neighborhoods energized, but you have to remember too that all wards don't have schools in them.

119
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:38,884
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was a lot of differences that would happen.

120
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:44,273
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the mayor stepping down as a chairperson was a very important person, and I think it's

121
00:12:44,714 --> 00:13:00,366
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very key point to remember that during all of this with the Collins Center by our side, we were constantly reminded that much of what the school committee does in terms of their guidelines is governed by the state and the Department of Education.

122
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:06,691
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of things that would have duplicated what's already in the law.

123
00:13:07,657 --> 00:13:11,839
[SPEAKER_00]: and things that we couldn't change because we don't have that control.

124
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:19,562
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to note that a lot of the school committee stuff is already in place statewide.

125
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:22,964
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't have the opportunity to change that.

126
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:35,829
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, there's some things that they asked for and we gave them in terms of procedures and budgets and being involved

127
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,353
[SPEAKER_00]: the next review, the next charter review.

128
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:48,781
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, there definitely was a lot had to do with the school committee, but most significantly is the districts, uh, uh, how they're going to be voting.

129
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:50,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

130
00:13:51,584 --> 00:13:52,505
[SPEAKER_02]: Good answer, Ron.

131
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,186
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

132
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:54,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

133
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:55,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good answer.

134
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:58,779
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been writing that for three years, John.

135
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:04,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I've said a lot on the shows.

136
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say it again.

137
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:08,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Work this inside and out.

138
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:09,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I know the effort.

139
00:14:09,888 --> 00:14:11,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I watch the effort.

140
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,530
[SPEAKER_02]: It is really

141
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:19,197
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the people of the City of Method, this is their document.

142
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:21,799
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the bottom line on everything.

143
00:14:21,859 --> 00:14:24,982
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, you guys did tremendous work.

144
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:30,706
[SPEAKER_02]: And you are the experts, so that's why you're on the show.

145
00:14:32,007 --> 00:14:37,911
[SPEAKER_02]: So, all right, so the next question now, you know, you have a new charter.

146
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:45,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are asking, you know, what about does it affect, you know, the city budget, the school budget?

147
00:14:46,581 --> 00:14:51,785
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is there going to be any changes to address the city and the school budgets?

148
00:14:52,885 --> 00:14:54,907
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, Milvi, you want to take that?

149
00:14:55,847 --> 00:14:56,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

150
00:14:56,327 --> 00:15:05,713
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the way the budget, city budgets are created and decided upon is really outlined in state law.

151
00:15:06,074 --> 00:15:08,315
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't really determine that in the charter, but

152
00:15:09,488 --> 00:15:32,920
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some timelines that we can determine, and one of the things that we added that we hope will improve the budgeting process is that every year on or before February 15th, so right at the beginning or before the budgeting season gets going, the mayor will call a joint meeting of the city council and the school committee.

153
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:36,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the process gets going,

154
00:15:37,462 --> 00:15:45,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Those three bodies, our elected bodies, will get together to review the financial condition of the city and share relevant information.

155
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:53,775
[SPEAKER_01]: So this hopefully is going to create a more collaborative budget process that will better reflect the needs of all areas of the city.

156
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:55,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Great answer.

157
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:56,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Milva.

158
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:03,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get into, you know, we're having city elections.

159
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:04,563
[SPEAKER_02]: They're coming up.

160
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:08,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're hearing a lot of talk about the city elections.

161
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:09,955
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for running, Milva.

162
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:11,356
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot.

163
00:16:11,396 --> 00:16:12,056
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it does.

164
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:14,017
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot to go out and do that.

165
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:18,959
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really appreciate, we all appreciate what you did, putting yourself out there.

166
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:27,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any changes in the charter about the election process in Medford?

167
00:16:29,445 --> 00:16:31,007
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are a few changes.

168
00:16:31,087 --> 00:16:39,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the biggest change is the ward representation and the district representation piece, and that will happen at the next election, not this one.

169
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:42,979
[SPEAKER_00]: So once it's put in place, one of the key

170
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:59,830
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that were brought up was the actual ballot itself, which, by the way, the ballot, we've seen the specimen ballot, and it's already out, and it's nice to see the ballot question about the charter is on the front page, so that's good news.

171
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:09,677
[SPEAKER_00]: But beside the fact that we're changing boundaries for the next election in two years, they're also looking at, you know, incumbents have a natural

172
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:12,946
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage on the ballot because they are the incumbent.

173
00:17:13,586 --> 00:17:21,628
[SPEAKER_00]: What will happen now is there'll be a random placement on the ballot of each candidate's name.

174
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:28,510
[SPEAKER_00]: And that process will be done by a random drawing for where they're positioned.

175
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:34,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it may sound like a very simple piece, but, you know, I guess the,

176
00:17:35,274 --> 00:17:48,203
[SPEAKER_00]: election people understand it a little bit better as placement can, anything can be an advantage and certainly placement could be one and that's one of the ones that was voted into this new charter plan.

177
00:17:48,863 --> 00:17:49,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

178
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:52,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a, I think that's a good point.

179
00:17:53,358 --> 00:17:55,020
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everyone's the luck of the draw.

180
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,062
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way it should be where you get placed.

181
00:17:58,524 --> 00:17:59,985
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot to say about that.

182
00:18:00,045 --> 00:18:01,407
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for that answer.

183
00:18:02,829 --> 00:18:03,129
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

184
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're covering quite a bit here.

185
00:18:07,894 --> 00:18:09,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the new charter

186
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:11,288
[SPEAKER_02]: offer anything?

187
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:13,050
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is one of my big things.

188
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:16,774
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of all of our big things in Medford.

189
00:18:17,535 --> 00:18:23,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to encourage citizen participation in Medford city government?

190
00:18:25,043 --> 00:18:25,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it help?

191
00:18:25,743 --> 00:18:26,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Will it do anything?

192
00:18:26,725 --> 00:18:28,927
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how do you feel about that?

193
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:39,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we have a, we don't have, we have a whole section of the new charter, a whole article, article eight that's titled citizen participation mechanisms.

194
00:18:39,497 --> 00:18:42,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that our current charter does not have.

195
00:18:42,297 --> 00:18:53,459
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so, uh, and there are different levels, um, of, of, um, actions that people can take under the, this proposed charter if it passes.

196
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:56,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the first is,

197
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:08,684
[SPEAKER_01]: what's called in the charter a group petition, where if you want to put something on the agenda for the council, you can get signatures to have it put on the agenda.

198
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:15,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, probably the first thing that people would try is to contact their Councilors.

199
00:19:15,707 --> 00:19:22,690
[SPEAKER_01]: But if that doesn't work, it might not always work, citizens will be able to get 100 signatures.

200
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:29,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the city council has to take up discussion of the measure.

201
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:34,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

202
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:44,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Other things that people would be able to do is if if they get together and get the signatures, they can put a measure on the ballot.

203
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:52,382
[SPEAKER_01]: For residents to vote on, that's definitely a lot more signatures, but it's possible.

204
00:19:55,603 --> 00:20:00,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, also overturning a measure passed by the city council.

205
00:20:00,705 --> 00:20:11,868
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's enough opposition to it and residents can get the required signatures, they can put on the ballot and ask the voters whether they want to reject that.

206
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:16,970
[SPEAKER_01]: And the last one is a recall of the mayor.

207
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:21,465
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's not something that can be done frivolously.

208
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:25,646
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a good bit of work to get the signatures.

209
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,387
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it would also go on the ballot.

210
00:20:30,047 --> 00:20:37,509
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's something that residents will be able to try or have the option of doing, which we don't have now.

211
00:20:38,093 --> 00:20:40,314
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's a great thing, I really do.

212
00:20:40,754 --> 00:20:45,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I don't think anyone's going to do it frivolously, but it's nice.

213
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:48,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And we never had the ability to do that.

214
00:20:48,235 --> 00:20:50,956
[SPEAKER_02]: So that might think that's going to go a long way.

215
00:20:51,176 --> 00:20:53,476
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all getting people more involved.

216
00:20:55,437 --> 00:21:00,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, the last couple of questions here, you've covered a

217
00:21:01,858 --> 00:21:06,179
[SPEAKER_02]: a large amount of the changes and you really made it clear.

218
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:09,400
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have a lot of questions.

219
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,721
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you answered them here.

220
00:21:11,341 --> 00:21:20,403
[SPEAKER_02]: But is there any other significant charter updates that we haven't covered or I haven't asked the questions to?

221
00:21:20,903 --> 00:21:23,584
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you can both answer this one if you want.

222
00:21:23,644 --> 00:21:25,805
[SPEAKER_02]: I just get a feel for

223
00:21:26,837 --> 00:21:32,320
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is there anything else we should be covering or anything else you guys want to discuss while we have?

224
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:32,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

225
00:21:33,741 --> 00:21:36,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would do you want to go 1st round or should I go?

226
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:37,423
[SPEAKER_00]: No, go ahead.

227
00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:37,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

228
00:21:38,624 --> 00:21:42,766
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, I, the 1 thing 1 thing I do just want to point out sort of.

229
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:45,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally speaking, our current charter is.

230
00:21:47,468 --> 00:21:49,450
[SPEAKER_01]: It's two pages.

231
00:21:51,111 --> 00:21:54,353
[SPEAKER_01]: There's many things that are not in it.

232
00:21:54,934 --> 00:22:03,641
[SPEAKER_01]: When we first started our committee process, one of the memos that the Collins Center wrote up for us, and that's the Collins Center for Public Management.

233
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:09,485
[SPEAKER_01]: They help a lot of cities and towns with charter review, and we were really lucky to have them.

234
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:23,042
[SPEAKER_01]: They wrote up a memo on the complexity of Medford's charter that basically, because it doesn't cover things, you'd have to go through state law, figure out, oh, what do we do about this?

235
00:22:23,142 --> 00:22:28,850
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's also makes it inaccessible for residents to understand how our government works.

236
00:22:29,945 --> 00:22:42,420
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, there are no vacancy provisions in our current charter for mayor or school committee, and there's a 1 for city council, but it's not it's incomplete.

237
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,185
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when we had a school committee member step down a couple of years ago.

238
00:22:47,506 --> 00:22:55,393
[SPEAKER_01]: there was some confusion and it was figured out, but, um, there was a period where it was like, what do we, what do we do about this?

239
00:22:56,034 --> 00:23:03,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if we had that situation with the mayor where a mayor had to step down or a mayor couldn't serve, I feel, you know, that could be a crisis for the city.

240
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:04,721
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we do?

241
00:23:05,602 --> 00:23:07,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we have vacancy provisions.

242
00:23:07,484 --> 00:23:13,169
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just an example of one of the ways in which our current charter is lacking.

243
00:23:13,628 --> 00:23:17,011
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's a good one.

244
00:23:17,291 --> 00:23:17,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.

245
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:19,773
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very important, by the way.

246
00:23:20,534 --> 00:23:23,996
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's great people know about that now.

247
00:23:24,157 --> 00:23:25,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Ron, anything else you want to add?

248
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:41,136
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, to Milva's point, I think that there are a lot of details that are in this charter that when people are deciding, if they have a question of why it isn't there, to go to the charter and take a look at the new charter.

249
00:23:41,156 --> 00:23:42,237
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all listed out there.

250
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:48,282
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that what we all have to remember, and it's a very difficult thing to remember, is when the charter is written,

251
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,562
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not written with Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn in the charter.

252
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:54,622
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the mayor.

253
00:23:55,223 --> 00:23:57,304
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a living document that moves on.

254
00:23:57,484 --> 00:23:59,084
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have personalities in it.

255
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:10,370
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the guidelines from the Collins Center and the ability to make a plan that's a blueprint for the future is not so easy when you have an existing operation running.

256
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:15,972
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, you know, Melville led a great committee to make sure that we have those details.

257
00:24:16,032 --> 00:24:17,833
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know she is as well as I am.

258
00:24:18,378 --> 00:24:24,101
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole committee is grateful to the Collins Center and very proud of the product that we put out.

259
00:24:24,962 --> 00:24:27,723
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty comprehensive.

260
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:29,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I encourage people to read it.

261
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:32,146
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no doubt it's comprehensive.

262
00:24:32,426 --> 00:24:33,807
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, I'll say it again.

263
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:39,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I said at the beginning of the show, it was a couple of years of hard work.

264
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,171
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys did a great job.

265
00:24:41,211 --> 00:24:42,932
[SPEAKER_02]: That whole committee did a great job.

266
00:24:43,492 --> 00:24:44,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really reached out.

267
00:24:46,486 --> 00:24:48,928
[SPEAKER_02]: The communication you had was exceptional.

268
00:24:48,968 --> 00:24:52,671
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to add to this, to the program.

269
00:24:52,751 --> 00:24:53,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I really did.

270
00:24:53,452 --> 00:25:01,939
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you hit every, I mean, while you were doing this, the communications out to the city were tremendous.

271
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,423
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people have lessons about communication.

272
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,021
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the message out, what you were doing, why you were doing it.

273
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:11,562
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all there.

274
00:25:11,962 --> 00:25:15,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And a guy like me, it made it easy for me to follow.

275
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:16,163
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all.

276
00:25:16,743 --> 00:25:19,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, John.

277
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:20,245
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I add one more thing?

278
00:25:20,265 --> 00:25:20,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

279
00:25:21,662 --> 00:25:33,125
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I just wanted to add, you know, we've talked about ward representation and it makes sense that we're talking about it a lot because it's really been kind of the major issue even before we got this charter review going.

280
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,525
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been hearing it for years.

281
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:40,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I meet people who just moved here from other cities and they say, what's what's going on?

282
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford doesn't have wards.

283
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:41,767
[SPEAKER_01]: That's weird.

284
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:50,549
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do know also that there's some concerns about, well, what are we going to do?

285
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:51,669
[SPEAKER_01]: That's four more people.

286
00:25:51,689 --> 00:25:53,450
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we going to pay for that?

287
00:25:54,070 --> 00:26:01,132
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say that you can't put a price tag on better government.

288
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:07,775
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to if we have more Councilors, we have more people to do work for the city.

289
00:26:07,915 --> 00:26:09,496
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll also get that back.

290
00:26:09,876 --> 00:26:12,057
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get it back with a better system of government.

291
00:26:12,577 --> 00:26:15,419
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get it back with more people actually working for the city.

292
00:26:16,805 --> 00:26:22,029
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as the salaries, the charter itself doesn't say what salaries are.

293
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:28,434
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing that says the salaries have to be the same or more or less.

294
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:31,777
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all things that can be worked out.

295
00:26:33,418 --> 00:26:36,281
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really like small potatoes in the big picture.

296
00:26:36,621 --> 00:26:37,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's good to know.

297
00:26:38,522 --> 00:26:47,425
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's very, very important that, and you said it up at the beginning of the show, Milva, about the representation.

298
00:26:47,465 --> 00:26:53,527
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's important that everyone in the city has the same or similar representation.

299
00:26:53,547 --> 00:26:55,848
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I like best about this.

300
00:26:58,309 --> 00:26:59,190
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's great.

301
00:27:00,688 --> 00:27:03,309
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so I want to thank you both.

302
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:06,070
[SPEAKER_02]: We're down to the last question now, okay?

303
00:27:09,011 --> 00:27:12,172
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a lot of people are talking about it, which is a good thing.

304
00:27:12,472 --> 00:27:13,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Go have a cup of coffee.

305
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,533
[SPEAKER_02]: People are talking here, there, everywhere you go now.

306
00:27:17,253 --> 00:27:18,274
[SPEAKER_02]: They know what's coming up.

307
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:22,275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a simple yes or no vote.

308
00:27:22,335 --> 00:27:27,817
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, if someone, you know, they have questions,

309
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:37,261
[SPEAKER_02]: they wanna know more about the charter, or they wanna get in touch with, and I'm being honest, they wanna get in touch with either one of you, or someone on the committee.

310
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:50,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any way, or is there an easy way, simplified way for them to, you have anything set up where they can get in touch with you, ask questions, get a response, or how is that working out?

311
00:27:53,174 --> 00:27:54,774
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's true.

312
00:27:55,255 --> 00:27:57,756
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of conversation, which is very exciting.

313
00:27:58,536 --> 00:28:01,438
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of questions out there, which is even more exciting.

314
00:28:02,958 --> 00:28:06,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Social media does its job with discussions out there.

315
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:19,779
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though our committee has been dissolved, there's a new committee out there, some of us are involved with, to help move this ballot question.

316
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:25,023
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, it's about further education.

317
00:28:25,083 --> 00:28:29,726
[SPEAKER_00]: When people are now engaged, the charter is submitted, can't be changed.

318
00:28:29,746 --> 00:28:31,867
[SPEAKER_00]: The governor signed off on it, so it can't be changed.

319
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:34,649
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are questions, and I see a lot of,

320
00:28:36,234 --> 00:28:40,777
[SPEAKER_00]: unintentional or intentional misinformation on social media.

321
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:53,043
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to, and I know Milva does as well, without influencing too much, but giving the real answer based on the research we've done, you know, there are things out there that are just wrong.

322
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:55,025
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just wrong and misleading.

323
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:56,766
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if it's intentional or not.

324
00:28:56,826 --> 00:28:59,007
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a website.

325
00:28:59,587 --> 00:29:03,029
[SPEAKER_00]: It's www.medfordcharternow.com.

326
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:08,563
[SPEAKER_00]: which will be an ever-growing website over these next 30 days.

327
00:29:09,884 --> 00:29:14,107
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows you the old charter, it shows you the new charter, it shows you information.

328
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:21,772
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be answering questions and coming up with frequently asked questions section of the webpage.

329
00:29:22,272 --> 00:29:27,956
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be a great resource for folks to go to, to see what people are asking.

330
00:29:28,316 --> 00:29:30,798
[SPEAKER_00]: And not that we're the definitive ones,

331
00:29:31,371 --> 00:29:38,255
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but certainly we have a good idea because we've done the research and we've done the backup and we know the limitations of what we could and couldn't write.

332
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:43,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we, we, we do have a little bit of experience, uh, with.

333
00:29:44,479 --> 00:29:47,180
[SPEAKER_00]: The questions that people are asking, we're asking, we asked.

334
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,242
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it's going to be a great resource for people.

335
00:29:50,302 --> 00:29:53,864
[SPEAKER_00]: It's medfordcharternow.com and, you know,

336
00:29:54,792 --> 00:30:07,067
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on social media and if you want to look me up in social media and send me a message and happy to either tell you what I know or find out from Milva who is

337
00:30:08,453 --> 00:30:09,214
[SPEAKER_00]: my resource.

338
00:30:10,735 --> 00:30:23,223
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, we're happy to get what we don't want is people going into that polling area, not knowing what the reasons for why they're voting for or against it.

339
00:30:23,604 --> 00:30:25,485
[SPEAKER_00]: But the document can't be changed.

340
00:30:25,685 --> 00:30:26,426
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.

341
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:30,909
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a document that in five years is going to be reviewed again the same way.

342
00:30:30,989 --> 00:30:36,313
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's time to give a little culture change to the city and get more people engaged.

343
00:30:36,953 --> 00:30:38,674
[SPEAKER_00]: this charter is the tool to do that.

344
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:41,415
[SPEAKER_00]: So I encourage people to go to that website.

345
00:30:41,455 --> 00:30:44,056
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up now, it is live and it's impressive.

346
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,641
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure they'll put that up there, but it's medfordcharternow.com.

347
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:56,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you very much.

348
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:57,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Melvi, you're all set.

349
00:30:57,663 --> 00:30:59,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to add?

350
00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:06,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to, you know, just Ron, you made me, you reminded me of something that there's been a little bit of confusion about in terms of

351
00:31:06,847 --> 00:31:14,431
[SPEAKER_01]: the city council because the charter says that the city council can hire staff subject to appropriation and they might get necessary expenses.

352
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:21,295
[SPEAKER_01]: But the key phrase there is by appropriation and the reality is that it's exactly the same as the system we have now.

353
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:28,119
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't hire a staff member or get expenses unless it's appropriated in the budget.

354
00:31:28,179 --> 00:31:30,100
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really not a change at all.

355
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:31,801
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just laid out there.

356
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:36,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So people aren't needing to buy appropriation, that's what's going on.

357
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:40,213
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that also, so it hasn't changed.

358
00:31:40,893 --> 00:31:41,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

359
00:31:41,153 --> 00:31:42,374
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not changed.

360
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:48,655
[SPEAKER_01]: They do have the clerk, which is already an employee of the city council.

361
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:54,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And there is an assistant, which the city council has always had a city messenger.

362
00:31:54,376 --> 00:31:57,136
[SPEAKER_01]: So they just changed the title of that, that's all.

363
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,837
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really pretty much, it's exactly the same.

364
00:32:01,137 --> 00:32:02,297
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, yeah.

365
00:32:03,053 --> 00:32:05,155
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also just want to say we have lawn signs.

366
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:13,582
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to support the charter with a lawn sign, you can go to the website or email us at info at medfordcharternow.com.

367
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:19,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And to get those lawn signs, and we have literature, we'll be dropping all over the city.

368
00:32:19,327 --> 00:32:23,751
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get involved in doing some lit drops, you can contact us.

369
00:32:24,031 --> 00:32:30,697
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have donation buttons on the website if you want to, you know, support us that way, because it all costs money.

370
00:32:31,566 --> 00:32:32,106
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it does.

371
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:33,227
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always important.

372
00:32:33,687 --> 00:32:40,571
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ron, I'm not one to correct anybody, much less you, but I am going to correct you on one thing.

373
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:41,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

374
00:32:41,811 --> 00:32:46,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Who in Milva are the definitive people to go to for the charter?

375
00:32:46,894 --> 00:32:47,374
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

376
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:53,497
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no, you know, your committee, you do, you have the answers.

377
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:55,498
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, you have the right answers.

378
00:32:56,298 --> 00:33:01,922
[SPEAKER_02]: And as usual, there is this misinformation and you guys cleared up a lot today.

379
00:33:01,962 --> 00:33:03,322
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really do.

380
00:33:03,362 --> 00:33:05,043
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we had you on the show.

381
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:10,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Our purpose on this show is, you know, to get the truth, the information out.

382
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:13,334
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys did a great job today.

383
00:33:13,354 --> 00:33:14,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I thank you very much.

384
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:15,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

385
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:16,837
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, John.

386
00:33:16,877 --> 00:33:17,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

387
00:33:17,898 --> 00:33:21,380
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be pushing this along with you.

388
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,181
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's that time again.

389
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:25,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you both for joining us.

390
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:27,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

391
00:33:27,504 --> 00:33:28,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you both.

392
00:33:28,545 --> 00:33:29,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

393
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the opportunity.

394
00:33:30,586 --> 00:33:32,668
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of information out there.

395
00:33:32,728 --> 00:33:33,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to help us.

396
00:33:33,889 --> 00:33:34,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

397
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:35,430
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

398
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:36,330
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.

399
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good day, everybody.

400
00:33:37,431 --> 00:33:37,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

401
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:38,752
[SPEAKER_00]: Take care.

402
00:33:40,973 --> 00:33:43,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's that time again.

403
00:33:43,034 --> 00:34:01,426
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to thank Melvin McDonald, Ron Givino for taking the time to inform our audience with facts and information about the new charter, because without facts, people are prevented from making informed choices.

404
00:34:02,987 --> 00:34:10,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And before we close, I want to let our audience know we are looking for Method residents to appear

405
00:34:11,275 --> 00:34:20,763
[SPEAKER_02]: on a Method Happenings show to share their views on what they expect from the members of the next city council.

406
00:34:21,423 --> 00:34:33,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're interested in appearing on a show, call us or contact us at Method Happenings, 02155 at gmail.com.

407
00:34:33,553 --> 00:34:37,096
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, I wanna thank everyone who has been watching.

408
00:34:38,155 --> 00:34:41,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for all the positive feedback we've been getting.

409
00:34:41,476 --> 00:34:45,278
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, we're, you know, we're getting a little negative too, that keeps us on his toes.

410
00:34:45,678 --> 00:34:48,319
[SPEAKER_02]: So we welcome negative comments as well.

411
00:34:48,979 --> 00:35:00,923
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you would like to share a comment, you're opening a new business, have an organization, an upcoming event, you know, anything you can think of.

412
00:35:01,386 --> 00:35:06,669
[SPEAKER_02]: and you want to appear on a future show, you can contact us once again.

413
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:11,873
[SPEAKER_02]: It's methodhappenings02155 at gmail.com.

414
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:21,699
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to remind everyone you'll be able to see replays of this show on Method Community Media, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 6 p.m.

415
00:35:21,739 --> 00:35:22,780
[SPEAKER_02]: or 7 p.m.

416
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,743
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot going on with the elections and candidates.

417
00:35:29,054 --> 00:35:32,337
[SPEAKER_02]: That schedule may change a bit over the next couple of weeks.

418
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:45,946
