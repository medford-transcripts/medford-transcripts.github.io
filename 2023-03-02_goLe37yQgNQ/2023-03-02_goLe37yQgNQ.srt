[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:12,329
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll be just a moment waiting for the other members.

3
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:40,659
Bye.

4
00:01:15,848 --> 00:01:28,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi everyone, sorry I'm late.

5
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:30,878
[SPEAKER_07]: It's okay.

6
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:35,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Just see here.

7
00:01:57,308 --> 00:01:59,970
[SPEAKER_07]: just give member McLaughlin another moment.

8
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:02,071
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me send her a message.

9
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:45,321
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, just one more minute and then we'll get started.

10
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:16,534
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I guess we should get going.

11
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:20,320
[SPEAKER_08]: There never seems to be enough time.

12
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,203
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

13
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:23,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, everyone.

00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:28,613

25
00:05:02,984 --> 00:05:07,868
[SPEAKER_08]: The Rules and Policies Subcommittee will review the Bullying Prevention and Intervention Plan for recommended updates.

26
00:05:08,489 --> 00:05:12,292
[SPEAKER_08]: This meeting is a continuation of our meeting held on December 6th.

27
00:05:12,972 --> 00:05:14,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I will take the roll.

28
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:15,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham?

29
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:16,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.

30
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,321
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see her yet.

31
00:05:23,022 --> 00:05:26,925
[SPEAKER_08]: And member Ruseau here, two present, we have a quorum.

32
00:05:28,106 --> 00:05:39,276
[SPEAKER_08]: So for those that were not on the last meeting, we went and discussed at a high level the current bullying prevention and intervention plan, which is on our website.

33
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:45,842
[SPEAKER_08]: We quickly realized that the content of the plan itself is not actually

34
00:05:47,622 --> 00:05:48,323
[SPEAKER_08]: A big problem.

35
00:05:49,403 --> 00:05:55,568
[SPEAKER_08]: The actual document is 38 pages and is a pretty big problem.

36
00:05:55,588 --> 00:06:00,571
[SPEAKER_08]: There's duplication and there's sections of it that read sort of like minutes.

37
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,752
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very odd document.

38
00:06:02,913 --> 00:06:06,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Seems like a stream of consciousness that ended up being published as the policy.

39
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:15,002
[SPEAKER_08]: So I reached out to the attorney general's office to ask if there was a way we could work on this Google document

40
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,032
[SPEAKER_08]: in any fashion other than going through it in the meeting line by line.

41
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:25,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it's 38 pages, that is a painful proposition.

42
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:30,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer from them was pretty direct.

43
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:33,517
[SPEAKER_08]: I will read from you just a couple sentences.

44
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:41,461
[SPEAKER_08]: The open meeting law does not carve out an exemption to the definition of deliberation for discussions that do not result in a decision or a vote.

45
00:06:42,212 --> 00:06:50,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Any communication among a quorum of a public body on matters that are pending or will come before it and within the public body's jurisdiction is considered deliberation.

46
00:06:51,856 --> 00:07:01,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Additionally, it says later on, public body members should not work on a shared document except for during a properly noticed meeting that is open to the public.

47
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:10,284
[SPEAKER_08]: non-substantive edits like proofreading for typos would be okay, but reworking a policy that would be considered deliberations.

48
00:07:10,924 --> 00:07:20,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the person that responded, Assistant Attorney General Benedin, says, we are aware of the inefficiencies that can result from this limitation.

49
00:07:23,049 --> 00:07:26,971
[SPEAKER_08]: It's close to an apology for what the law says, I think, is we're going to get.

50
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:48,441
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to, if this makes sense to Member Graham, I'm going to share the current policy and then we're going to go page by page through it, which hopefully there'll be sections we can move quickly through.

51
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that sound okay, Member Graham?

52
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:55,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay, great.

53
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:56,182
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

54
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:57,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

55
00:07:58,183 --> 00:07:59,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me get the sharing going.

56
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:07,479
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the one button I can never find is share.

57
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:10,241
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, there it is.

58
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:14,944
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the one that's green, meant to make it obvious, but has the opposite effect with me.

59
00:08:20,188 --> 00:08:20,588
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

60
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:23,630
[SPEAKER_07]: Do folks see that?

61
00:08:25,912 --> 00:08:26,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

62
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:31,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Now let me, thankfully I have a big screen, but I have to make some adjustments.

63
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:32,256
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

64
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:35,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello, Member McLaughlin.

65
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:38,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to note that you are present.

66
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:39,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Hello.

67
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:40,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

68
00:08:40,543 --> 00:08:40,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

69
00:08:41,763 --> 00:08:43,144
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to go through this.

70
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:50,146
[SPEAKER_08]: I just read the Attorney General's response, which said that I can't share a document with anybody, unfortunately.

71
00:08:52,086 --> 00:08:56,708
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to have to go through this in this posted meeting.

72
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,309
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the current document that's on our website.

73
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,590
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can tell that it

74
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:09,024
[SPEAKER_08]: has the approval date from 2010, which I'm guessing is when the law was passed.

75
00:09:10,064 --> 00:09:17,427
[SPEAKER_08]: As I said in the last meeting, unfortunately, the name of the actual policy is written into the law.

76
00:09:17,987 --> 00:09:20,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Typically, school committees are not writing implementation plans.

77
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:24,929
[SPEAKER_08]: That is pretty explicitly not what we're supposed to be doing.

78
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:30,991
[SPEAKER_08]: But in this case, the law is very, very clear that that's what this document is called.

79
00:09:34,385 --> 00:09:35,825
[SPEAKER_08]: I, let's see.

80
00:09:36,526 --> 00:09:40,047
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not gonna go through the table of contents, because that will update automatically.

81
00:09:43,047 --> 00:09:44,528
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the current document.

82
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:49,949
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gone through and started to do some suggested modifications.

83
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me increase this.

84
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:57,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this tiny for everybody or is it okay?

85
00:09:59,592 --> 00:09:59,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good.

86
00:09:59,972 --> 00:10:01,353
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

87
00:10:01,573 --> 00:10:02,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I never know the answer to that.

88
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:12,142
[SPEAKER_08]: So some of this document is written in a way that very much feels like the law just passed and we're going to tell you about the law.

89
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:21,731
[SPEAKER_08]: It's now been 13 years and so some of the language doesn't seem to make a lot of sense.

90
00:10:21,771 --> 00:10:25,534
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also an awful lot of change management kind of language in here.

91
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:26,255
[SPEAKER_08]: They know this talks

92
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:37,611
[SPEAKER_08]: if we looked at that before I said to cut that, the new state anti-bullying law, I mean, it's not new, saying that we must have this.

93
00:10:39,112 --> 00:10:40,793
[SPEAKER_08]: It was revised in October, 2011.

94
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:46,795
[SPEAKER_08]: The following guidelines were revised in 2014, and most recently in November of 2020.

95
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:53,758
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I look at this document, I think about what's the purpose of this document.

96
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:57,782
[SPEAKER_08]: And what do we want this document to do?

97
00:10:58,602 --> 00:11:04,668
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the most important things for any kind of policy is that it's actually something the people that should know it can read.

98
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:07,750
[SPEAKER_08]: 38 pages is problematic in that regard.

99
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:14,156
[SPEAKER_08]: And so does anybody who needs to read the current policy need to know the full history of it?

100
00:11:14,296 --> 00:11:15,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the answer is probably no.

101
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:19,160
[SPEAKER_08]: So I recommended that we cut this and

102
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:33,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I will just keep going and if the members feel like, or if anybody feels like, no, this really is something we need to keep in there, please just raise your hands or speak up because I might miss your hand.

103
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,442
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not going to read every line.

104
00:11:42,307 --> 00:11:53,712
[SPEAKER_08]: This one here, there's this is a is violations policy for any student to engage in bullying or cyber bullying at a location activity function or program that is not school related.

105
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:59,611
[SPEAKER_08]: or through the use of technology or electronic device that is not owned, leased, or used by the school district.

106
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:14,644
[SPEAKER_08]: If the bullying creates a hostile environment at school, or the victim infringes on the rights of the victim at school, or materially or substantially disrupts the education process or just orderly operation of the schools as determined by the school.

107
00:12:15,405 --> 00:12:16,726
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not suggesting we cut this.

108
00:12:17,146 --> 00:12:21,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually think this is probably part of what the law was aimed at.

109
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:27,182
[SPEAKER_08]: my question, you know, we write the policy and then the district has to implement it.

110
00:12:27,482 --> 00:12:41,692
[SPEAKER_08]: When I read this, I get really like, you know, I think there was a case at the Supreme Court just within the last couple of years about a student who had said something on TikTok or Instagram or something.

111
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:47,416
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the district punished her and it was completely outside of school.

112
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:48,877
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it was in the summer even.

113
00:12:50,638 --> 00:13:01,784
[SPEAKER_08]: And so my question, just how on earth are we monitoring stuff that's happening outside of school and making this determination?

114
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:06,447
[SPEAKER_08]: And I realized my comments are really tiny.

115
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:11,149
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me zoom and hopefully you can see that, but how do we determine this?

116
00:13:11,229 --> 00:13:15,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It feels a bit like we're just sending me the arbiters of behavior of students 24 seven and it,

117
00:13:19,595 --> 00:13:21,436
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think the intent is a problem.

118
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:24,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think, how on earth does this get implemented?

119
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

120
00:13:26,837 --> 00:13:28,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you zoom back out again so I can see it?

121
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:29,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, yes.

122
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:30,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

123
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:43,382
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, just having worked with a number of folks who have been through this process, and it's just so abstract, as I'm sure you can imagine, particularly with

124
00:13:44,103 --> 00:13:48,066
[SPEAKER_02]: social media, it can be really, you know, tricky.

125
00:13:48,266 --> 00:14:11,181
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the way the, what I've seen and experienced is the way that these things get handled, you know, sometimes well, and sometimes maybe it could have been done better is through reporting from usually, you know, the victim or the victim's family, particularly around things that are outside of school.

126
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:12,942
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is,

127
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:24,320
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, and was the intent of the law, in my opinion, that this is addressed in and outside of school, particularly because, oh my God, I'm forgetting Phoebe's name.

128
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,080
[SPEAKER_02]: What was Phoebe?

129
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:29,762
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the girl from Hopkinton that a lot of this law was created by, if anybody remembers.

130
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:31,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Phoebe Prince, South Hadley.

131
00:14:31,742 --> 00:14:32,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

132
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:33,183
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, South Hadley.

133
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:46,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Phoebe Prince, that so much of this law was created for her, you know, that that was the problem is that she was, you know, obviously, one of the problems is that she was being bullied 24 seven, you know, through all kinds of, you know, means.

134
00:14:46,506 --> 00:14:48,587
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that that was one of the reasons that it was addressed.

135
00:14:48,647 --> 00:14:56,289
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that, in my opinion, one of the things is that families need families and students and obviously staff need to be

136
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:11,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Educated and informed around this to understand that that is the policy and that it can and should be reported outside of school, you know, in you I think you had an example of what about if they're at summer camp and they have a bullying situation do we get the call and go to work to deal with this.

137
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:17,118
[SPEAKER_02]: In the middle of July, when the students aren't even available to us for interactions, I would say yes, I mean I think that.

138
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:34,957
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to figure out some of that, well, particularly maybe when it, I would defer to Maurice about, you know, whether it's, you know, that summer and we're convening people to deal with it over the summer, or if we're getting the notification and we're making a plan for when the students are returning in September, I'm not really sure, but the notification I would think can and should happen in July.

139
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:40,581
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there needs to be a process for that because it does extend to outside of our school.

140
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:42,783
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my two cents, thanks.

141
00:15:43,664 --> 00:15:44,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

142
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:45,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to hear from

143
00:15:47,099 --> 00:15:55,945
[SPEAKER_08]: the folks that would have to deal with it, which I presume is the principals, like, I mean, we won't get into the edge case of a student who's a rising ninth grader.

144
00:15:56,065 --> 00:16:02,169
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's no, you know, the principal at the high school does not have any relationship.

145
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:09,874
[SPEAKER_08]: The principal at the middle school is, I don't know when their responsibility ends, but I assume the last day of school of June.

146
00:16:10,975 --> 00:16:15,317
[SPEAKER_08]: That edge case I think is complicated, but you know,

147
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:37,395
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, July 18th, you're maybe taking a vacation and there's a report, whether it's through the new reporting system we have, do you all believe that it is your responsibility and expectation that you will swing into action to do whatever you do if it happened during a school day in a regular normal week of the school year?

148
00:16:39,036 --> 00:16:39,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham.

149
00:16:41,177 --> 00:16:41,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

150
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:42,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I think

151
00:16:44,477 --> 00:16:50,081
[SPEAKER_10]: I totally understand the spirit of what this paragraph is trying to accomplish.

152
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:53,183
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's rather poorly worded and confusing.

153
00:16:53,783 --> 00:17:12,435
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there is a difference between how things that happen outside of school impact students during school in the building and who is responsible for taking action for discreetly things that happen outside of the school.

154
00:17:13,094 --> 00:17:19,655
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this paragraph is worded in such a way that those two things are like completely muddled together.

155
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:32,837
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think like in your summer camp example, like if there was a situation at summer camp, like the school district would not supersede, right?

156
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:40,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Like the activity and the responsibility of the summer camp simply because the two students happened to be students that met for public schools or not.

157
00:17:42,610 --> 00:18:00,600
[SPEAKER_10]: And to the extent that that issue was like handled and resolved during the summer at summer camp or wherever they are, that would sort of be outside the sort of fringe of school.

158
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:11,165
[SPEAKER_10]: But if there's something that starts in summer and makes its way into the building such that it is like infringing on a student's rights,

159
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,935
[SPEAKER_10]: to an education, that's different.

160
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:34,488
[SPEAKER_10]: So I feel like this paragraph is poorly worded because it like muddies the water and makes it sound like the school is the arbiter of literally every possible bullying situation that an individual might come in contact with simply because they go to Medford public schools.

161
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:37,390
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think that's the intent of the paragraph, but I think

162
00:18:38,462 --> 00:18:42,183
[SPEAKER_10]: that was certainly how I read it the first time and I was sort of taken aback.

163
00:18:42,223 --> 00:18:49,604
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there's some rewording there that would clarify those boundaries in some way.

164
00:18:49,764 --> 00:18:58,046
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe at some point in the policy, there need to be some examples that would make that clear for people so people understand.

165
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:03,507
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that was my read of this paragraph was just that the paragraph simply needs work.

166
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:07,388
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a pretty,

167
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:11,616
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think this is a criticism of the document in general.

168
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:15,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that's a very long, complicated sentence.

169
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:17,158
[SPEAKER_10]: That's one sentence.

170
00:19:18,318 --> 00:19:23,540
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's full of like qualifiers and commas and all kinds of things.

171
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,781
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, so that's only one sentence.

172
00:19:27,841 --> 00:19:29,321
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the length of a paragraph.

173
00:19:29,421 --> 00:19:33,903
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's far too complex to be understandable.

174
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:34,323
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think

175
00:19:35,117 --> 00:19:38,719
[SPEAKER_10]: the point of all of our policy should be to be clear and understandable.

176
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:44,682
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's a big part of the problem that I have with this particular sentence.

177
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:47,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

178
00:19:47,537 --> 00:19:49,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin, is your hand up again or you just had to put it down?

179
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:50,378
[SPEAKER_02]: It is up again.

180
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:52,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, go ahead.

181
00:19:52,799 --> 00:20:04,044
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess first I wanted to ask, you know, if Howard's here or whether, you know, Howard is going to be here at some point for things, because I think that we could, you know, I mean, I think that's part of what the law is.

182
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:09,987
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always so debatable and whether we're interpreting the law the correct way for this and all of those things.

183
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:15,529
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it makes these, a lot of these things really sort of ambiguous and I'm not sure that

184
00:20:16,491 --> 00:20:18,913
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really our role to try to figure some of it out.

185
00:20:18,973 --> 00:20:20,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's a little bit concerning for me.

186
00:20:20,754 --> 00:20:34,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other concern is just as an example that you had member Rizzo a few minutes ago about, you know, and I know you said that, you know, sort of the fringe moving from one school to another, you know, one, you know, middle school to high school or something like that.

187
00:20:34,743 --> 00:20:35,804
[SPEAKER_02]: is sort of outside of the scope.

188
00:20:35,824 --> 00:20:37,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would actually beg to differ.

189
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:48,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we actually had a personal experience that I will share that, you know, where there was some middle school bullying and, you know, we're encouraged, this was a long time ago, so I don't want people to think that it's anybody that is currently within our schools.

190
00:20:49,392 --> 00:20:58,577
[SPEAKER_02]: But we were encouraged to not file a report, and instead to allow, you know, administration to notify each other of the situation so that

191
00:20:59,184 --> 00:21:21,121
[SPEAKER_02]: know incoming administration would be aware to keep an eye out to make sure that this wasn't happening at you know another school or what have you and that's part of the problem is that if there's not and it didn't happen but that's part of the problem is if there's not communication between one school to another when kids are transitioning that can be terribly problematic so I don't know that that was necessarily a good example and I'm just saying that for

192
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:27,806
[SPEAKER_02]: edification really of the public, I guess, in terms of how these can be really tricky.

193
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:35,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think our role here, if I understand correctly, is that we want to try to be clear and succinct with what our policy is.

194
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:49,743
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that there also has to be some legal review or something of it, because I don't think that we are in a position to interpret the law.

195
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:51,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

196
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,370
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I agree.

197
00:21:53,030 --> 00:22:04,073
[SPEAKER_08]: We definitely, that's a great idea to get Howard in here or I can send him questions after of the things that we identify because I think that that's really important.

198
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:05,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

199
00:22:07,013 --> 00:22:19,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I guess this document is enough of a mess that it would be a pretty egregious use of taxpayer dollars to ask Howard to

200
00:22:20,398 --> 00:22:21,919
[SPEAKER_10]: clean this up in its current state.

201
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:27,362
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do think we need his, like his eye and his lens on this, but I think there's.

202
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:36,407
[SPEAKER_10]: A considerable amount of work to do before, um, we get to the point where that's a good use of his time and our money for him to, to do that.

203
00:22:36,527 --> 00:22:47,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, you know, for example, there's three places where there are definitions in this document, like that, that can't be, there needs to be one place where all the definitions exist.

204
00:22:47,915 --> 00:22:59,958
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there is like a first pass we need to take through this and then bring Howard in for the like more legal spin and making sure that the intent of the law is being carried out in this policy.

205
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:08,920
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think there is like a lot of work that we can do before we're going to be at a stopping point to bring Howard into the mix.

206
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:14,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I agree we plenty we can do.

207
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:26,914
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm actually literally going to put notes of ask Howard, when we think that there is a situation like that rather than saying Howard here's 38 pages and pretending that that won't cost us anything.

208
00:23:28,316 --> 00:23:29,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, remember McLaughlin.

209
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:47,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks know to be clear that's not what I'm suggesting, but I am suggesting that I would like to keep draft of the document with all edits recorded and you know maybe we're doing save as so we have versions or something but my concern is because we don't know, you know,

210
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:56,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm sure that there are some things here that are pretty obvious, whether if there's repeated information, it's pretty clear it doesn't need to be repeated, those sorts of things.

211
00:23:56,181 --> 00:24:04,308
[SPEAKER_02]: But if there are things that we are making a decision that, oh, we think we can omit, but we don't, in fact, really know that, then how do we really know that is what I'm saying.

212
00:24:04,408 --> 00:24:07,231
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I would say agreed.

213
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:11,434
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's work that we can do here before it goes to an attorney.

214
00:24:11,454 --> 00:24:14,056
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think that we need to keep

215
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:39,355
[SPEAKER_02]: versions and records of what our edits were so that it is really clear or just keep again the comments and the strikeouts and what have you if we want to do that, but to be clear, so that whoever is looking at it can see what the process and what some of the work was because I think that there may be instances where we could, and this is why I think an attorney needs to look at it primarily, where we could be thinking we're doing something that is appropriate when we're not.

216
00:24:40,545 --> 00:25:01,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, before the meeting, I had reached out to a couple of friends about when KP Law reviews ordinances, the document that is being reviewed by the council has the strikes and the edits and the public watching the meeting can literally follow along with how the ordinance is going to change.

217
00:25:02,154 --> 00:25:03,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's fabulous.

218
00:25:04,494 --> 00:25:05,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, Google,

219
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,051
[SPEAKER_08]: isn't Word.

220
00:25:08,152 --> 00:25:12,777
[SPEAKER_08]: Word, I think, gives you all those features, and I noticed that even KP Lab was not using Google, they were using Word.

221
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:20,906
[SPEAKER_08]: But saving versions of our S as we go will definitely solve that, and not clicking the checkbox so everything disappears.

222
00:25:21,847 --> 00:25:22,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Were there any

223
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:31,270
[SPEAKER_08]: administrators that wanted to comment on this issue of, A, how does it actually happen now in the two different scenarios?

224
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:41,075
[SPEAKER_08]: The one, let's just be simplistic and say the middle of the summer, but also the transition between middle and high school, for instance.

225
00:25:41,095 --> 00:25:46,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Like how does that kind of thing happen now or does it happen now?

226
00:25:46,517 --> 00:25:49,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is your understanding of your responsibilities under the law

227
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,081
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you see those things?

228
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:01,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Tucci.

229
00:26:03,828 --> 00:26:04,528
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi there, good afternoon.

230
00:26:04,988 --> 00:26:06,670
[SPEAKER_00]: What I would say in terms of my comments.

231
00:26:07,815 --> 00:26:15,639
[SPEAKER_00]: would be that certainly if there is a situation on social media that we become aware of, it is very, very hard to police all the happenings on social media.

232
00:26:15,719 --> 00:26:21,603
[SPEAKER_00]: But oftentimes we have relationships with our students where we do receive these tips that we have to follow up on.

233
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:31,968
[SPEAKER_00]: And oftentimes we will encourage our students to capture a concerning interaction they might have or might have viewed on social media by capturing it with a screenshot.

234
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,470
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they tell and report it to a trusted adult.

235
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:44,653
[SPEAKER_00]: And if something like this is brought to our attention, you know, certainly what we would do is we would, you know, kind of investigated try to learn a little bit more about what's behind it.

236
00:26:45,094 --> 00:26:50,515
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we make that determination that it is substantially disrupting the educational process or operations of the school.

237
00:26:51,636 --> 00:26:54,477
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where we have the legal grounds is my understanding from a.

238
00:26:55,137 --> 00:27:06,840
[SPEAKER_00]: litigious standpoint to be able to potentially act upon that and even assign consequences and progress down potential areas where maybe it's a cyber bullying or bullying type of matter.

239
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:14,222
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not sure if that exactly gets to the point of your question, but I feel like I can respond in that sense.

240
00:27:14,262 --> 00:27:15,943
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to take any follow-up questions you might have.

241
00:27:17,003 --> 00:27:17,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

242
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:18,184
[SPEAKER_08]: That's helpful.

243
00:27:19,044 --> 00:27:19,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I should delay that.

244
00:27:21,697 --> 00:27:22,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.

245
00:27:22,437 --> 00:27:27,438
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I have to obviously I think Nick put it in the same perspective as I would put it in.

246
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we do try.

247
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:39,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how successful all the time it is but we do try to discuss transitions from eighth grade to ninth grade of things that have been noted.

248
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:54,641
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, you know things that maybe Nick has noted that he's seen that he would bring to our attention, moving forward from things sometimes not always bullying sometimes conflicts between students.

249
00:27:55,642 --> 00:28:01,486
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that I have been noticing a little bit of noticing here that.

250
00:28:03,282 --> 00:28:05,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are happening online, even on gaming.

251
00:28:05,743 --> 00:28:16,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been dealing with a lot of verbal back and forth when kids are on video games, back and forth, and it becomes more of a serious conflict.

252
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:26,656
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, where that lines and where we figure those things out is dependent of that information coming to us and then determining what we go from there.

253
00:28:26,716 --> 00:28:29,938
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, a lot of what Nick said, I would definitely echo.

254
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:31,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

255
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:34,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Cushing?

256
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:46,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, I think that this section, so a lot of this is boilerplate from the original publication done back in the early 2010s.

257
00:28:47,245 --> 00:28:53,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I just did a quick look up and found another school district where it's essentially the exact same.

258
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,793
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think a lot of this is boilerplate that was pushed out.

259
00:28:56,174 --> 00:28:59,397
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't mean it can't be changed, but I will say that

260
00:29:00,498 --> 00:29:07,903
[SPEAKER_04]: So bullying, we have to give due process to all parties involved under the 14th Amendment.

261
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:20,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And over the summer, a school being involved over the summer is a very challenging situation to be able to really

262
00:29:22,976 --> 00:29:32,803
[SPEAKER_04]: The school is there to support and to do whatever is possible, but generally speaking, it's looked at, at least in my experience, it's looked at from the start of school to the end of school.

263
00:29:33,684 --> 00:29:47,995
[SPEAKER_04]: And then as was mentioned previously, if there's carryover from the summer, that's obviously things that need to be addressed, but that presents a significant challenge for school leaders to be able to have all the evidence.

264
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:53,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you, I appreciate that.

265
00:29:53,852 --> 00:29:59,113
[SPEAKER_08]: We should just keep moving since we have 36 more pages.

266
00:29:59,473 --> 00:30:06,335
[SPEAKER_08]: I put a note in here when I first read this about not tolerating retaliation, I kind of feel like maybe I don't need to say that.

267
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:19,338
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just get rid of my own comment unless somebody feels that this needs to be more verbose, but not tolerating retaliation against a person that does mean anybody, so students, staff,

268
00:30:21,324 --> 00:30:22,765
[SPEAKER_08]: anybody within our jurisdiction.

269
00:30:22,865 --> 00:30:26,809
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know that we need to make that more complicated.

270
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:33,736
[SPEAKER_08]: And I appreciate, Dr. Cushing, that you found that there's a boilerplate.

271
00:30:33,836 --> 00:30:41,543
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of times what happens is the law is passed and then our professional association will typically draft

272
00:30:42,618 --> 00:30:45,500
[SPEAKER_08]: for substantial things, they will draft boilerplate.

273
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:53,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes DESE does it themselves, and this may have come from DESE, but they will draft a boilerplate since they know every district has to adopt it.

274
00:30:53,404 --> 00:30:59,967
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, as I spend more time in the policy manual looking at other districts, it's shocking how many districts have

275
00:31:00,586 --> 00:31:03,068
[SPEAKER_08]: exactly the same language for policy.

276
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,570
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not shocking, it makes sense.

277
00:31:06,351 --> 00:31:09,593
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not that somebody sat around in Medford and wrote this document.

278
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:11,415
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that that happened.

279
00:31:12,656 --> 00:31:13,216
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Cushing?

280
00:31:13,897 --> 00:31:23,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and just so everyone's aware, the edits and updates that were made two years ago were definitely not as in-depth as these, which I think the policy definitely needs.

281
00:31:24,205 --> 00:31:26,828
[SPEAKER_04]: It was more focused on making sure the forms were functional,

282
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:34,550
[SPEAKER_04]: and really allowed for principals to have an ability to use forms that would really be beneficial.

283
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:45,854
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second part is to update because there was an update to the law, I believe it was around 2014, that expanded who could be considered a bully as well as some other provisos.

284
00:31:46,094 --> 00:31:52,376
[SPEAKER_04]: So two years ago or so when we looked at this, those were the primary functions of that review.

285
00:31:53,756 --> 00:31:54,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

286
00:31:54,277 --> 00:31:55,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I remember that.

287
00:31:57,637 --> 00:32:06,029
[SPEAKER_08]: So going through this, this is something I thought we should add, is a definition of cyberbullying.

288
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:13,940
[SPEAKER_08]: And while electronic communication sort of covers everything, given the past

289
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:26,926
[SPEAKER_08]: several months, I felt it was important to explicitly call out video, which I think has become a very harmful way of bullying, a seemingly passive way of bullying.

290
00:32:27,186 --> 00:32:36,837
[SPEAKER_08]: But I look forward to the day when we can say that the policy is students taking videos of a kid getting beat up and sharing it with their

291
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:44,557
[SPEAKER_08]: 1200 classmates, that that's bullying, that that's a disciplinary action, a very substantial one.

292
00:32:44,657 --> 00:32:57,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when I hear about students who have been beat up, and then I hear about students who perhaps attempted suicide, was it because they got beat up or was it because 1,400 other people in their school got to watch it?

293
00:32:59,265 --> 00:33:05,867
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not that person, I don't know, but it seems reasonable to conclude that it is the video sharing.

294
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:11,848
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the humiliation, widespread humiliation and video that's forever.

295
00:33:11,868 --> 00:33:15,209
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, getting beat up is never good.

296
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:16,289
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a problem.

297
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:23,711
[SPEAKER_08]: By having a video of it for the rest of your life, for your kids, your grandkids, your great grandkids, I mean, this stuff's never going away.

298
00:33:24,851 --> 00:33:27,712
[SPEAKER_08]: That's probably the bigger harm.

299
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:29,847
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the long-term harm.

300
00:33:30,487 --> 00:33:37,671
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, um, finding a way for us to get explicit on this particular topic is important to me.

301
00:33:37,691 --> 00:33:38,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember Graham.

302
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:40,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

303
00:33:40,233 --> 00:33:40,673
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

304
00:33:40,873 --> 00:33:56,102
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I was going to ask that there be a section for definitions that includes bullying and cyber bullying and whatever this met for public school paragraph is at the bottom probably is a different topic, but there also are definitions on page 19.

305
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:09,869
[SPEAKER_10]: And on page 26, and I didn't look to see if they are in conflict with each other, but I think they all like definitions need to be in one place, either right here or at the back of the document.

306
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:17,935
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, because right now they're just like scattered all over the document and the same words are being used again and again and again.

307
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:23,600
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to see us on those other definitions up here as well.

308
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,201
[SPEAKER_10]: And just make a section about.

309
00:34:25,959 --> 00:34:29,581
[SPEAKER_10]: definitions to consolidate that and make it a little bit more cohesive.

310
00:34:30,462 --> 00:34:30,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

311
00:34:33,804 --> 00:34:34,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. K?

312
00:34:37,986 --> 00:34:43,830
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wondered if maybe the word social media should be mentioned somewhere in regard to this.

313
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:58,413
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it says apps you added the word apps, but we just had a case recently that came across our door of kids who were being mean to each other on Snapchat and complicated thing with Snapchat is it goes away.

314
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:07,277
[SPEAKER_01]: And so luckily for us, the child took a screenshot when she reported to her teacher that she was being bullied.

315
00:35:08,318 --> 00:35:10,040
[SPEAKER_01]: But those things are happening all the time.

316
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:16,605
[SPEAKER_01]: And that makes it just all the more complicated for us to follow up and get to the bottom of it, because these things are happening at home.

317
00:35:17,646 --> 00:35:22,170
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just wondered if in the definition somewhere, maybe it states that word as well.

318
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

319
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:23,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

320
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:24,712
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

321
00:35:24,772 --> 00:35:25,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I missed that.

322
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:26,653
[SPEAKER_08]: That one's such an obvious one too.

323
00:35:26,713 --> 00:35:27,074
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

324
00:35:27,694 --> 00:35:28,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Edward-Pinson.

325
00:35:32,483 --> 00:35:37,887
[SPEAKER_07]: You're muted.

326
00:35:37,927 --> 00:36:00,726
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just had wanted to comment a little earlier when you had added the definition with the other pieces about video and what the other administrators were sharing and saying that first it was bullying and now we're dealing with the cyber bullying and

327
00:36:01,768 --> 00:36:12,474
[SPEAKER_06]: This is truly a problem, but there's also like a limitation because when you think about bullying, it's about someone wanting to show power.

328
00:36:13,234 --> 00:36:18,877
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to be the powerful one and take advantage of someone else in that particular point in time.

329
00:36:19,437 --> 00:36:26,381
[SPEAKER_06]: And so technology and media or videoing is now

330
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:44,038
[SPEAKER_06]: being manipulated in such a way that whoever the videographers are or the person who's actually doing the bullying, they feel empowered by that and I just feel like it's

331
00:36:49,739 --> 00:36:56,801
[SPEAKER_06]: As we create this and kind of say what our expectations are, I think there's so much about education that needs to happen.

332
00:36:56,821 --> 00:37:11,486
[SPEAKER_06]: And member McLaughlin, I hope she will share, but there is going to be something taking place next week on March 9th about bullying with our,

333
00:37:13,306 --> 00:37:34,605
[SPEAKER_06]: special education, I want to be able to say it the right way, but Medford's going to be doing a bullying workshop and it's about what parents and professionals need to know is the title of the workshop and it's being done in collaboration with the Federation for Children with Special Needs and I just feel like

334
00:37:35,697 --> 00:37:44,822
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to continue to educate demonstrate and show our students that are in front of us what is appropriate and what is inappropriate.

335
00:37:45,803 --> 00:37:57,309
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to add that piece to the conversation because there were some things you know we can have the best intentions, but if someone truly has malicious intent.

336
00:37:58,311 --> 00:38:06,516
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we need to be able to say that this is wrong, and also get that person the necessary help that is needed.

337
00:38:07,096 --> 00:38:15,362
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just kind of feel like bullying has existed for a long time but the way in which it presents itself now.

338
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:30,651
[SPEAKER_06]: with these videos getting liked and I don't know how people do it, but they resurface it, they share it with different people, they do the airdrops, you know, the images, students taking images of themselves.

339
00:38:31,552 --> 00:38:34,114
[SPEAKER_06]: with limited clothing or no clothing.

340
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:40,899
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, it is a form of bullying and sometimes it ends up classified as child pornography.

341
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:51,147
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm just saying that these are the things that the administrators, especially at the secondary level 612 world have to deal with.

342
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:58,553
[SPEAKER_06]: on a consistent or not a consistent day, but at least they've encountered it enough times.

343
00:38:59,494 --> 00:39:17,364
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just feel that the education, educating parents, helping parents to become partners with the district, for them to understand, like, when we're reaching out to you to say that this is what's taking place, we truly do need them to partner and collaborate with us.

344
00:39:19,465 --> 00:39:22,028
[SPEAKER_06]: get the appropriate supports their child needs.

345
00:39:22,649 --> 00:39:33,983
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes the cell umbrella I just, I can't stress it enough because it's something that we're all dealing with and we shouldn't pretend that it's not happening.

346
00:39:34,884 --> 00:39:36,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, thank you.

347
00:39:37,047 --> 00:39:37,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

348
00:39:38,328 --> 00:39:38,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

349
00:39:39,635 --> 00:39:51,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I just wanted to add for the for the presentation on the ninth, it is the Federation for children with special needs that is doing it full disclosure I work for them I don't do the presentation, I just know about it.

350
00:39:52,527 --> 00:39:59,233
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also contracted through DC, so the Federation is contracted to Department of Education to provide this training so it's not.

351
00:39:59,994 --> 00:40:03,177
[SPEAKER_02]: specific to just children with disabilities.

352
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:05,059
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not specific to just families.

353
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:12,005
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also caregivers, guardians, foster families, and staff and others.

354
00:40:12,405 --> 00:40:14,247
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's a really good opportunity.

355
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,008
[SPEAKER_02]: It's virtual.

356
00:40:16,129 --> 00:40:19,992
[SPEAKER_02]: We will see if it can be recorded potentially for people if they need the link shared.

357
00:40:20,072 --> 00:40:22,795
[SPEAKER_02]: If they're not able to make it, there's a registration link that I did share.

358
00:40:23,335 --> 00:40:23,896
[SPEAKER_02]: and a flyer.

359
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:32,222
[SPEAKER_02]: I know CPAC and the district are working together to get this flyer out to the community and the superintendent will be getting information out as well.

360
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:33,663
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that.

361
00:40:33,683 --> 00:40:38,947
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that there's so many nuances and so many pieces that are really tricky.

362
00:40:38,967 --> 00:40:48,135
[SPEAKER_02]: And as Maurice was just saying a moment ago, I was actually talking with somebody just last week specifically about the child pornography issue, because it's not just

363
00:40:49,196 --> 00:41:03,276
[SPEAKER_02]: an issue for the person that creates it if somebody forwards that image they're, they're considered complicit, I mean, it gets really messy and can get really troubling with law enforcement I'm on the, I'm also on the board of an organization called mass kids which is about.

364
00:41:04,517 --> 00:41:05,498
[SPEAKER_02]: child abuse prevention.

365
00:41:05,598 --> 00:41:09,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know some of those things around that and it just can get really messy.

366
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:13,583
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think training for everybody is a really, really, really good point.

367
00:41:14,824 --> 00:41:21,509
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully people will come on the night that it won't be the only training that exists, but I just, I would second Dr. Ebay, thank you.

368
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:27,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham, and then maybe we can move on.

369
00:41:27,713 --> 00:41:32,456
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'd like also to see us add a section to this document around

370
00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:39,878
[SPEAKER_10]: the district's administrative obligations around education.

371
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:48,285
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it's perfectly appropriate for us to set policy that says the district will do certain things.

372
00:41:50,026 --> 00:41:59,214
[SPEAKER_10]: And we should have, and it should, there's stuff in here that's like a clear, like example of why doing that is like,

373
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Graham, you are muted again, I don't know why.

374
00:42:06,981 --> 00:42:10,023
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

375
00:42:11,724 --> 00:42:21,451
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there's some like clear examples in this document of why like sort of putting policy directives around what the district will do doesn't work.

376
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:32,618
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I do think like some sort of like annual obligations that the district has around education

377
00:42:33,495 --> 00:42:44,562
[SPEAKER_10]: would be important provided that we can like craft it in a way that is not as prescriptive that it becomes useless, which I think most of this document sort of falls into.

378
00:42:44,582 --> 00:43:00,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but I think instead to say from a policy perspective, we will, uh, you know, at the beginning of the year, do X and on an annual basis, we'll do Y that kind of thing, I think would be appropriate somewhere in the document, um, to add a section because I didn't see.

379
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:02,881
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't see that in here.

380
00:43:02,901 --> 00:43:13,590
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe it may just be scattered all about, but I didn't see anything about making this digestible for students and parents.

381
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:18,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Like this document is by definition, not digestible for anybody.

382
00:43:18,454 --> 00:43:29,884
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think beyond having a document that's digestible, which I think we need to work to, I think the way you make documents digestible, as you talk about them,

383
00:43:30,957 --> 00:43:35,060
[SPEAKER_10]: in a consistent way, and then you demonstrate that those things happen in a consistent way.

384
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:39,822
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there is good reason to add something like that to the document.

385
00:43:39,882 --> 00:43:48,527
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to draft something before the next meeting, and you can share it and insert it at that time, but I'll leave that to the group.

386
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:49,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, if you want to...

387
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,591
[SPEAKER_08]: And this goes for anybody, really.

388
00:43:52,651 --> 00:43:59,012
[SPEAKER_08]: If you have something you think we should be inserting, please don't hesitate to bring some draft language.

389
00:43:59,052 --> 00:44:02,833
[SPEAKER_08]: We can pop it on the screen and think about where it fits.

390
00:44:05,194 --> 00:44:07,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are running fast on our time.

391
00:44:07,995 --> 00:44:10,436
[SPEAKER_08]: But Dr. Everett-Vinson, if you have another thing to quickly say.

392
00:44:11,096 --> 00:44:14,057
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just was going to let member Graham know as well.

393
00:44:14,137 --> 00:44:18,658
[SPEAKER_06]: The shorter version, which is strictly the forms, is like an eight-page document.

394
00:44:19,476 --> 00:44:23,459
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's eight pages or six pages, which has the actual forms.

395
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,302
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you.

396
00:44:26,662 --> 00:44:27,683
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, member Rousseau.

397
00:44:28,203 --> 00:44:41,614
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do know that there is repetition in this document, but there, at least based on what my understanding was, there was a certain amount of information that

398
00:44:42,955 --> 00:44:44,256
[SPEAKER_06]: did need to be included.

399
00:44:44,717 --> 00:44:58,571
[SPEAKER_06]: And so like the revision of member was so adding like videos and, you know, I'm not sure what the next technological advancements going to be but, you know, moving from phones there's probably going to be.

400
00:44:59,892 --> 00:45:22,131
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, recording eyeglasses or something like that, where, you know, in the next five years, it's probably not even going to be the phone, it's going to be some other, maybe it's going to just be the watches that people are wearing, where there's still going to be video, videoing and recording what's happening, but it's, it's just going to be some new, updated electronic device.

401
00:45:23,072 --> 00:45:23,832
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um,

402
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:37,057
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do feel like we will always be adding whatever the new things are, but I think people need to understand how wide, like the breadth of this topic.

403
00:45:38,377 --> 00:45:46,140
[SPEAKER_06]: It, it, it really is expansive, everything that could fall under the umbrella of bullying.

404
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:48,208
[SPEAKER_06]: That was all I want.

405
00:45:48,228 --> 00:46:01,500
[SPEAKER_06]: So I know this is the longer version, but people may opt to use the shorter version, which is, you know, the form packet, and then go to this one to kind of read the details.

406
00:46:02,688 --> 00:46:03,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

407
00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:13,173
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to get back to the language here so we can move along at least to the sections where we cut them out, because that will make us feel like we've done something by chopping whole sections out.

408
00:46:14,534 --> 00:46:16,475
[SPEAKER_08]: But I certainly don't want to stifle conversation.

409
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:20,837
[SPEAKER_08]: This word here, intelligence, I don't even get it.

410
00:46:21,097 --> 00:46:27,501
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, does anybody read this sentence and have any idea what on earth this is meant by this?

411
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:29,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I just can't make it make sense.

412
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:35,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, I think it's, you know, like FBI speak.

413
00:46:37,804 --> 00:46:41,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just, you know, writing images on video data or intelligence of any nature.

414
00:46:41,445 --> 00:46:44,105
[SPEAKER_02]: So intelligence could be like old style notes, right?

415
00:46:44,665 --> 00:46:48,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Like anything that sort of is, that is evidence of bullying.

416
00:46:48,986 --> 00:46:52,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

417
00:46:53,367 --> 00:46:54,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anybody mind if we get rid of it?

418
00:46:55,747 --> 00:46:56,627
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just weird.

419
00:46:58,488 --> 00:47:00,768
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like you could change it to information and it,

420
00:47:01,341 --> 00:47:03,021
[SPEAKER_10]: would at least be understandable.

421
00:47:03,041 --> 00:47:04,662
[SPEAKER_10]: I like that.

422
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:06,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Or evidence.

423
00:47:06,763 --> 00:47:07,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say evidence.

424
00:47:07,703 --> 00:47:09,323
[SPEAKER_02]: Data or evidence of any nature.

425
00:47:10,524 --> 00:47:11,264
[SPEAKER_08]: Evidence is fine.

426
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:13,224
[SPEAKER_08]: How about information or evidence?

427
00:47:13,264 --> 00:47:14,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I like information, too.

428
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:15,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why that's not there.

429
00:47:16,165 --> 00:47:20,706
[SPEAKER_08]: How about there?

430
00:47:21,287 --> 00:47:21,567
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

431
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:24,908
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you know what the right comment is in a list.

432
00:47:26,048 --> 00:47:26,848
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

433
00:47:26,888 --> 00:47:28,889
[SPEAKER_08]: So definitely the social media edition.

434
00:47:31,088 --> 00:47:32,789
[SPEAKER_08]: This paragraph here.

435
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:37,111
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we could probably lose facsimile, but that's just me.

436
00:47:37,812 --> 00:47:38,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, right?

437
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:39,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's that?

438
00:47:40,313 --> 00:47:41,874
[SPEAKER_02]: That's after social media.

439
00:47:43,875 --> 00:47:44,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

440
00:47:45,355 --> 00:47:47,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we still have fax machines, Dr. Edouard-Vincent?

441
00:47:48,397 --> 00:47:48,797
[SPEAKER_08]: We do?

442
00:47:49,057 --> 00:47:49,357
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

443
00:47:49,438 --> 00:47:50,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I guess we'll leave them for now.

444
00:47:50,938 --> 00:47:52,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.

445
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:53,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

446
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,000
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

447
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:58,282
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time something requires one, I'm at a complete panic.

448
00:47:58,342 --> 00:47:59,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, where do you even get one of these?

449
00:48:01,014 --> 00:48:01,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Just come to my house.

450
00:48:04,817 --> 00:48:16,723
[SPEAKER_10]: In that paragraph where it says cyberbullying includes, and then it has all these like parenthetical, like one, two, three, like, can we not use that sort of nomenclature?

451
00:48:16,863 --> 00:48:19,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I feel like it's really hard to read.

452
00:48:19,285 --> 00:48:26,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, I think putting that in actual bullets would make much more sense, like cyberbullying includes, and then

453
00:48:27,212 --> 00:48:28,853
[SPEAKER_10]: that's a bullet, there's another bullet.

454
00:48:28,893 --> 00:48:35,156
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's like another sentence that is, I think, another bullet that is just structured completely differently than all the rest.

455
00:48:35,176 --> 00:48:45,781
[SPEAKER_10]: And some of this stuff we just probably are gonna need to clean up multiple times, but I think trying to make this stuff understandable is like its own body of work.

456
00:48:46,801 --> 00:48:55,145
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think what we heard in the last meeting was like, if you could get through the document, it's sort of all here.

457
00:48:58,057 --> 00:49:07,541
[SPEAKER_10]: And we actually have a bigger problem with doing the things that are in this document than we do with like having written the right things down on paper.

458
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:16,765
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have to attribute at least some of that to this document being so complicated to like read and internalize.

459
00:49:16,905 --> 00:49:23,968
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think for our part, like we can commit to making this a more readable document.

460
00:49:25,676 --> 00:49:36,886
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that for the part on the, the principals and the assistant principals and the administrators who need to do this, like that, they, that we've done our part to like make their job easier.

461
00:49:36,966 --> 00:49:46,455
[SPEAKER_10]: Cause their job is already hard enough on this front without trying to like, sort of, we weighed knee deep through the language here.

462
00:49:47,736 --> 00:49:49,577
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, so.

463
00:49:51,157 --> 00:49:53,798
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I would agree with that, Member Ruseau.

464
00:49:53,898 --> 00:50:03,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that we all have ideas on ways to do that, and I think I know that Member Graham offered to sort of take a pass at that.

465
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:13,905
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a very good idea, not to have everybody doing this, but if Member Graham, because I know you like to organize things, if she's willing, as she had said earlier, taking a pass.

466
00:50:14,605 --> 00:50:32,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just recommend, I mean, I'm sure you know how to clean up documents as I'm sure we all do, but I would also just recommend like the subheadings right making it really clear, you know, all the ways that we learned, you know, to write, what have you but, and I would also add and I know that I have talked to Dr. Cushing in

467
00:50:34,268 --> 00:50:34,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

468
00:50:34,488 --> 00:50:41,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowen about this, and I believe there is hopefully an iteration of it that we can include at some point, a visual.

469
00:50:41,931 --> 00:50:51,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So there will be a visual for those who don't learn, who are neurodiverse potentially and don't learn with all of the text and the subheadings and the bullets and all those fun things.

470
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:56,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that will have something that we can distill hopefully visually.

471
00:50:57,457 --> 00:50:58,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely.

472
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:07,510
[SPEAKER_08]: So this thing here, I just feel like there was something I've heard that is far more up to date.

473
00:51:08,911 --> 00:51:11,372
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's just why I added that comment.

474
00:51:11,452 --> 00:51:20,777
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel like there's another word people are using these days to describe this, but it's not important right this second.

475
00:51:22,046 --> 00:51:40,354
[SPEAKER_08]: The who to report to, yeah, again, like this paragraph is huge and it's so important and it could just be a simple one page workflow, a flowchart that anybody could understand versus this incredibly dense, I guess it's more than one paragraph.

476
00:51:40,414 --> 00:51:48,438
[SPEAKER_08]: But my question was, do we expand this teacher or principal for who to report to, to include other people?

477
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:59,855
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, I mean, those are the people I think of, but like you could report it to a nurse or guidance Councilor or a member of Glockenburg.

478
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:03,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

479
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,340
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw my tiny little hand raised.

480
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,941
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I didn't actually do the hand raise.

481
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:07,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, member Rousseau.

482
00:52:08,723 --> 00:52:11,005
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm backing up a little bit as we're looking at this though.

483
00:52:11,165 --> 00:52:14,728
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm asking, is there adoption of a bullying prevention curriculum?

484
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:18,872
[SPEAKER_02]: So probably about-

485
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:21,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Two lines up.

486
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:30,546
[SPEAKER_08]: I will say, I don't know if we have one now, but I'm on the ECAT, the health education curriculum, whatever that long thing is.

487
00:52:31,246 --> 00:52:38,872
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've made that front and center as something that we have to have bullying prevention as well as bystander training.

488
00:52:38,913 --> 00:52:44,177
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't know what we have now, but we will definitely have one.

489
00:52:44,197 --> 00:52:49,341
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe Michigan model has some, but I don't think we were happy with it.

490
00:52:51,200 --> 00:53:04,309
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can ask someone from the team in a second, if you don't mind, but I'm assuming that the, or maybe I shouldn't assume, are those HECAT meetings public or are their notes, they're not public.

491
00:53:04,369 --> 00:53:05,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there minutes coming out of them?

492
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Like how, yeah, that's interesting.

493
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:11,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause how are we getting, will there be reporting out of that?

494
00:53:12,114 --> 00:53:12,254
[SPEAKER_02]: How?

495
00:53:12,394 --> 00:53:12,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.

496
00:53:13,155 --> 00:53:13,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

497
00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:13,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

498
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:14,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

499
00:53:14,516 --> 00:53:15,436
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be reporting out.

500
00:53:16,017 --> 00:53:16,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

501
00:53:16,317 --> 00:53:17,138
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll check in with,

502
00:53:18,288 --> 00:53:26,134
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe with Dr. Cushing in terms of what the schedule is, and I'd like to know sort of, you know, some of the agenda items as well, because I think it's important to know that that's on there.

503
00:53:26,154 --> 00:53:28,916
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I didn't realize that bullying prevention curriculum was gonna be.

504
00:53:28,936 --> 00:53:37,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the heat cat covers, frankly, I was unaware, even though I'm, I mean, I volunteered to be on it.

505
00:53:37,181 --> 00:53:39,283
[SPEAKER_08]: I did not understand that the heat cat covered.

506
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:43,830
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it just covers so much.

507
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,332
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really impressive.

508
00:53:45,772 --> 00:54:00,824
[SPEAKER_02]: And just for the edification of, again, the public watching our folks that are on here that don't know what the HECAT is, Peter, would you mind, through the chair, Member Ruseau, if Dr. Cushing could just... It's the Health Education Curriculum Analysis Tool.

509
00:54:02,385 --> 00:54:10,252
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a committee has been convened to, or not a committee, a group has been convened based on applications that were

510
00:54:10,827 --> 00:54:14,368
[SPEAKER_02]: submitted and chosen to review that.

511
00:54:16,068 --> 00:54:16,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct?

512
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:17,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

513
00:54:18,009 --> 00:54:18,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

514
00:54:18,649 --> 00:54:18,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

515
00:54:19,669 --> 00:54:20,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

516
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:21,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Grant.

517
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:23,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks.

518
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:29,992
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, just one thing about the HECAT before we, like, move on that I want to make clear.

519
00:54:30,632 --> 00:54:33,953
[SPEAKER_10]: That committee is not an advisory committee to the school committee.

520
00:54:34,133 --> 00:54:38,754
[SPEAKER_10]: That committee was established by the superintendent who has

521
00:54:39,201 --> 00:54:41,862
[SPEAKER_10]: the full purview of curriculum selection.

522
00:54:42,543 --> 00:54:54,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So the fact that those meetings are not public and there are not minutes being published in the public are because the superintendent in her role is not subject to the open meeting law the same way that the school committee is.

523
00:54:54,589 --> 00:55:03,474
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's nothing inappropriate going on that the superintendent absolutely has the full latitude to do exactly what she's doing and establish a committee.

524
00:55:04,955 --> 00:55:07,316
[SPEAKER_10]: She happened to ask that the school committee

525
00:55:07,867 --> 00:55:10,168
[SPEAKER_10]: have somebody participate, and that's member Rousseau.

526
00:55:11,229 --> 00:55:12,649
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to like put that out there.

527
00:55:12,669 --> 00:55:31,459
[SPEAKER_10]: I do think for this policy, like what's important is that as a matter of policy, that we will maintain and deliver high quality bullying prevention and bystander training, I think is the appropriate thing for this to say.

528
00:55:32,411 --> 00:55:42,437
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what the rest of the paragraph says, but I think that's the appropriate thing from a policy perspective that belongs in here around the bullying.

529
00:55:42,837 --> 00:55:58,766
[SPEAKER_10]: But we should stop short of naming a particular curriculum because the school committee does not have the authority to select curriculum and putting it in a policy document means we will surely be out of compliance at some point in time when the curriculum changes and we forget that it was in here.

530
00:55:58,826 --> 00:56:00,447
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just wanted to,

531
00:56:01,419 --> 00:56:25,344
[SPEAKER_10]: suggest that somewhere in this document in some iteration, we identify that that is a requirement of this policy, that it's our policy that the administration like maintain and deliver high quality curriculum, but that it doesn't have to be more like definitive or explicit or prescriptive than that because this is a policy document.

532
00:56:26,353 --> 00:56:26,914
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree.

533
00:56:27,154 --> 00:56:33,000
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that, you know, that it's providing the bullying prevention curriculum and bystander training.

534
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:42,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would, you know, I would go, I would also suggest that that would not, would be to staff and families.

535
00:56:46,253 --> 00:56:46,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Agreed.

536
00:56:48,615 --> 00:56:50,517
[SPEAKER_07]: And Mr. DeLay then.

537
00:56:52,598 --> 00:56:53,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

538
00:56:53,118 --> 00:57:00,702
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually going to the statement where it says should be reported immediately to his or her teacher or principal.

539
00:57:00,822 --> 00:57:03,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we include assistant principal with that?

540
00:57:04,024 --> 00:57:09,186
[SPEAKER_03]: I think assistant principals have a unique working with students as well.

541
00:57:10,007 --> 00:57:14,309
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that would be something that you'd want to add into this document.

542
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:17,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

543
00:57:18,011 --> 00:57:18,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Evan-Benson.

544
00:57:19,905 --> 00:57:25,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I had wanted to share that there is a flowchart.

545
00:57:26,329 --> 00:57:32,772
[SPEAKER_06]: I know remember Graham you were saying something I just shared that flowchart with you.

546
00:57:33,713 --> 00:57:40,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of talks about the steps in a visual way I don't know if it's.

547
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:51,028
[SPEAKER_06]: something that maybe as we continue to go through at some point, if we stop the screen share, you might be able to screen share.

548
00:57:51,108 --> 00:57:52,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this it?

549
00:57:53,489 --> 00:57:55,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that is it, Member Ruseau.

550
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:58,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you able to make it larger, a little larger?

551
00:57:58,351 --> 00:58:02,414
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope so.

552
00:58:05,655 --> 00:58:09,577
[SPEAKER_06]: This is kind of what happens when bullying

553
00:58:11,424 --> 00:58:33,244
[SPEAKER_06]: when a bullying report is submitted, it's a visual way of kind of showing which way it goes, but it's just something that we also use internally that could end up making its way into the revised document that we're working on.

554
00:58:33,264 --> 00:58:35,406
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted you to have that because I did

555
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:53,286
[SPEAKER_06]: Here you remember McLaughlin saying something about like for people who are visual learners or, you know, they could better understand what are the steps that happen, what are the steps that are taken when bullying is reported to the district.

556
00:58:53,326 --> 00:58:59,632
[SPEAKER_06]: So this was just one other piece that I wanted to make sure that you were able to mention.

557
00:59:01,428 --> 00:59:02,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau, may I?

558
00:59:02,949 --> 00:59:07,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just wanted to say thank you for this, and I know that Dr. Cushion and Ms.

559
00:59:07,812 --> 00:59:09,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowen worked on this, and I really appreciate it.

560
00:59:09,453 --> 00:59:26,824
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think that there's some things, and we don't have to get into it now, I'm happy to, you know, if you're interested, Dr. Edouard-Vincent or Dr. Cushion, give some support, lend some support around some visuals that could support this, PEX images, picture exchange images that I know,

561
00:59:28,357 --> 00:59:28,537
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

562
00:59:28,557 --> 00:59:43,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowen is familiar with as well, but also just fonts that are accessible, font sizes that are accessible, and sort of some of the, I don't know, I like straight lines, that's just me, but that's sort of a straight line.

563
00:59:43,935 --> 00:59:46,938
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just some of the aesthetic of it, but I think that there's some ways that

564
00:59:47,759 --> 00:59:49,660
[SPEAKER_02]: there could be one or two iterations of this.

565
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:57,103
[SPEAKER_02]: So would love to give, you know, feedback if you're interested, but I think that this is really important and I think it really... Always happy to take feedback.

566
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:58,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Dr. Cushman.

567
00:59:59,965 --> 01:00:00,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

568
01:00:00,485 --> 01:00:04,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember, Graeme, is your hand still up because you wanted to talk again?

569
01:00:04,847 --> 01:00:06,568
[SPEAKER_10]: I wanted to say something about the flowchart.

570
01:00:07,408 --> 01:00:08,709
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, one second.

571
01:00:10,057 --> 01:00:16,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I, I do think, um, there's a lot of opportunity to improve this flow chart, particularly.

572
01:00:16,378 --> 01:00:30,481
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, beyond some of the visual, like this does not clearly talk about accountability and who is responsible for what, um, and a good flow chart always clearly outlines, um, who is responsible for actions.

573
01:00:30,982 --> 01:00:33,702
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think, um, I think there's a lot of opportunity here.

574
01:00:33,982 --> 01:00:37,083
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to suggest that, um, if we.

575
01:00:37,706 --> 01:00:40,328
[SPEAKER_10]: intend to include this in our policy.

576
01:00:40,348 --> 01:00:43,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and maybe we can talk about that.

577
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:53,059
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, that, you know, one of us take a shot at what a revised flow chart might look like, and then, um, bring it back to the group and share.

578
01:00:53,079 --> 01:01:03,208
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I think we're going to have to, you know, find a way to like divide and conquer this document, um, because we're going to be meeting until the end of time.

579
01:01:04,512 --> 01:01:06,795
[SPEAKER_10]: If we don't be happy to do that.

580
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:10,560
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

581
01:01:11,562 --> 01:01:12,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm happy to do that.

582
01:01:13,244 --> 01:01:17,911
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau member Graham and then bring it back for another subcommittee meeting.

583
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:20,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.

584
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:28,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just was gonna say yes we're definitely open to the feedback member Graham where you were saying the accountability piece.

585
01:01:28,754 --> 01:01:37,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes, it will be bullying can be reported by a parent or a guardian a caregiver who could be completing the initial form.

586
01:01:38,238 --> 01:01:42,100
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes it will be initiated from the school side going out.

587
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:46,422
[SPEAKER_06]: So we also have to just keep that in mind of who the initial reporter is.

588
01:01:47,222 --> 01:02:03,830
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that was just, again, something to at least let us know what were the preliminary steps, but we are definitely open to feedback and getting this document updated and reflective of the work that's taking place right now.

589
01:02:04,691 --> 01:02:07,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I understand that completely.

590
01:02:07,172 --> 01:02:07,612
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think

591
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:25,514
[SPEAKER_10]: it's, you know, there's going to be a lot of places where there are many people who can be involved in a step, which I think does make it confusing, especially for a parent who was like just trotting along their, their year and found themselves in a situation where they needed to pay attention to this.

592
01:02:25,574 --> 01:02:32,098
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it shouldn't be hard for them to understand who they can expect to engage with them and

593
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:40,432
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think like anytime you make a long list like this, like you should report it to your teacher, your coach, your guidance Councilor, your nurse, your assistant principal, or your principal or other school staff.

594
01:02:40,472 --> 01:02:41,613
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that's great.

595
01:02:41,773 --> 01:02:43,114
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like all encompassing.

596
01:02:43,575 --> 01:02:47,578
[SPEAKER_10]: But if you are the person reading this and you're like, I have a problem and I don't know who to go to.

597
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:51,761
[SPEAKER_10]: And you read this, like, I don't think it helps you make a decision.

598
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:59,787
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that may not be the purpose or intent of the policy, but something has to help people with a clear path.

599
01:03:01,265 --> 01:03:11,509
[SPEAKER_10]: at a time when something traumatic is happening, either to them or their child, to say, like, if I do this, the right next steps will happen.

600
01:03:11,529 --> 01:03:17,611
[SPEAKER_10]: And I won't fall into a situation where I did the wrong thing because I thought I did the right thing.

601
01:03:17,651 --> 01:03:24,133
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think it doesn't, I think in the policy, this language is fine, but in the, like,

602
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:43,469
[SPEAKER_10]: parent-facing simple flow chart, that needs to be really clear to them so that they're not working harder to figure out how to tell somebody something's going wrong than they are about taking care of their child, for example, or making sure there's some immediate action happening.

603
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:47,490
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think those two documents, they don't have to say exactly the same thing.

604
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:49,091
[SPEAKER_10]: They can be for different purposes.

605
01:03:49,651 --> 01:03:53,073
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do think one of those documents, I think the flow chart,

606
01:03:53,605 --> 01:04:02,889
[SPEAKER_10]: has to be crystal clear for parents about what to do and who they can expect to respond when they raise an issue.

607
01:04:03,750 --> 01:04:12,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think what I've heard again and again from parents who have been in this situation is they all thought they did the right thing.

608
01:04:13,214 --> 01:04:17,597
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they found out that they missed a step in the process or they

609
01:04:18,856 --> 01:04:19,997
[SPEAKER_10]: said the wrong word.

610
01:04:20,137 --> 01:04:30,203
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just, we have to find a way past those hiccups because I think they are catastrophic in terms of the relationship that we're trying to have with parents.

611
01:04:31,704 --> 01:04:32,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

612
01:04:34,205 --> 01:04:37,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Nicole, are you able to unmute yourself?

613
01:04:38,628 --> 01:04:39,188
[SPEAKER_07]: One second.

614
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:42,730
[SPEAKER_09]: There I am.

615
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:43,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Nicole Branley.

616
01:04:43,651 --> 01:04:50,313
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just wondering if on the flowchart, if there could be timeframes, is that something that's possible?

617
01:04:51,254 --> 01:05:02,478
[SPEAKER_09]: If your child is experiencing bullying and they do report it and it's, you know, not considered a conflict, but it is, you know, filed into bullying.

618
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:05,141
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, is that day one?

619
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:07,382
[SPEAKER_09]: How long is the process going to take?

620
01:05:07,482 --> 01:05:10,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Is, you know, is it start the first day that it's reported?

621
01:05:10,744 --> 01:05:13,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it after three reports?

622
01:05:13,185 --> 01:05:17,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Just if there's some sort of timeframe that you can expect answers.

623
01:05:25,331 --> 01:05:26,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea.

624
01:05:26,092 --> 01:05:28,913
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that makes sense.

625
01:05:29,413 --> 01:05:30,154
[SPEAKER_02]: Member Ruseau?

626
01:05:30,874 --> 01:05:31,054
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

627
01:05:33,374 --> 01:05:34,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Is Miss Brownlee done?

628
01:05:35,117 --> 01:05:36,339
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done, sorry, I'm done.

629
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:38,102
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I mean, I'm not really ever done, am I?

630
01:05:38,443 --> 01:05:39,685
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm done at the moment, yes.

631
01:05:40,491 --> 01:05:41,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

632
01:05:41,811 --> 01:05:46,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So also I wanted to mention, and it's something for, it's really food for thought.

633
01:05:46,452 --> 01:05:49,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I don't know that it's for right now, but we do need to think about it.

634
01:05:50,033 --> 01:06:04,796
[SPEAKER_02]: And so maybe it's something that we're putting in our notes or what have you that, you know, it needs to be explicit that, you know, this is not, you know, and I know it says in one sentence here, but it does not say sort of procedurally what that means, but that, you know, there can be bullying

635
01:06:05,756 --> 01:06:06,657
[SPEAKER_02]: by staff, right?

636
01:06:07,438 --> 01:06:11,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Or by teachers or by guidance Councilors.

637
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:16,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the people that were saying it needs to be reported to immediately is his or her, blah, blah, blah.

638
01:06:17,204 --> 01:06:23,368
[SPEAKER_02]: And what if in one of those instances, that is the person, so that they're feeling that they're being bullied again.

639
01:06:23,468 --> 01:06:28,571
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we have to think about how we state that.

640
01:06:28,771 --> 01:06:30,052
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe it's after this.

641
01:06:30,272 --> 01:06:31,153
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

642
01:06:31,593 --> 01:06:33,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to put that in the parking lot.

643
01:06:36,729 --> 01:06:38,150
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Dr. Kaye.

644
01:06:39,891 --> 01:07:05,203
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to, when we're talking about timelines, I think it's very important for us to keep in mind too, I don't know about the high school and the junior high level, but it is incredibly time consuming for the, at least at the Mississaugas to, from the point of when it arrives on our desk to when we get it done, because oftentimes we're investigating and we talk to one child and that leads us to four more.

645
01:07:05,923 --> 01:07:12,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those four, you know, it's like the Fabergé commercial, you tell two and they'll tell two and so on and so on, if you remember that from years gone by.

646
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:25,243
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, literally when I got back from my leave, I had nothing but bullying reports on my desk and not all of them were founded, but that's all I was doing pretty much when I got back here, because we talked to kids at length.

647
01:07:25,724 --> 01:07:27,405
[SPEAKER_01]: We try not to put words into their mouth.

648
01:07:27,726 --> 01:07:28,306
[SPEAKER_01]: They're little.

649
01:07:29,022 --> 01:07:34,904
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they sometimes don't really fully understand, although many times it does happen that it is bullying.

650
01:07:34,984 --> 01:07:38,946
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, I think we need to be cautious when we're putting timelines.

651
01:07:39,046 --> 01:07:43,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to say from the time we get it, that the investigation starts.

652
01:07:44,248 --> 01:07:52,632
[SPEAKER_01]: But from that point on to me, it's really worrying and it makes my job even harder to say that, you know, we have to start investigating and be done within three weeks.

653
01:07:53,592 --> 01:08:00,158
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because sometimes vacations come in between, especially if we're talking about having us have to deal with it over the summer, right?

654
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:01,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?

655
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely makes sense.

656
01:08:03,441 --> 01:08:03,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

657
01:08:03,681 --> 01:08:04,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that.

658
01:08:04,281 --> 01:08:05,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's really important.

659
01:08:06,363 --> 01:08:17,513
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and I think when I think about timelines, I think of, I think of having an understanding as the person who's waiting

660
01:08:19,417 --> 01:08:39,331
[SPEAKER_08]: an expectation of when you would reach out and say, did something, you know, get lost or forgotten rather than, you know, on this date and time, it should have been resolved and it isn't, so I should then call the superintendent.

661
01:08:40,552 --> 01:08:47,817
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, the parent, for instance, might have no idea that when there's a bullying report,

662
01:08:48,371 --> 01:08:53,375
[SPEAKER_08]: that it might take a couple of days or more.

663
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:57,357
[SPEAKER_08]: So when is the parent supposed to say like, okay, it's been too long?

664
01:08:57,958 --> 01:09:07,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I think if the parent doesn't know it's been too long, then they're gonna add to your burden by communicating early over and over again.

665
01:09:09,234 --> 01:09:19,060
[SPEAKER_08]: And that I think is why setting expectations is so important is, you know, it's like, okay, you know, like you get a colonoscopy and it's going to be two days before you get your results.

666
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:28,906
[SPEAKER_08]: So you don't call your doctor four times the first day and four times the next day, because you've been told it's going to be a couple of days, but it's been two months.

667
01:09:30,687 --> 01:09:31,848
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a problem.

668
01:09:32,068 --> 01:09:35,450
[SPEAKER_08]: But that would only happen if nobody told you the expectation.

669
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:42,351
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that when I think about a timeline, I think of the expectations that people will have.

670
01:09:43,431 --> 01:09:44,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

671
01:09:46,632 --> 01:09:47,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

672
01:09:47,092 --> 01:09:50,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree with that, that there should be some response timeline at least.

673
01:09:51,473 --> 01:09:56,454
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also would imagine that there's going to be some legal timeline.

674
01:09:57,414 --> 01:09:57,654
[SPEAKER_02]: No?

675
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:05,296
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe there is something in here about how the law does have something.

676
01:10:06,712 --> 01:10:08,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I won't dig into it right now.

677
01:10:08,073 --> 01:10:11,335
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, obviously, whatever we set for timelines has to fit within the law.

678
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:13,897
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think Howard will be helpful in that.

679
01:10:15,238 --> 01:10:15,818
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that.

680
01:10:15,858 --> 01:10:16,879
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a really excellent point.

681
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:17,679
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

682
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:30,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I feel pretty strongly that there have to be timelines of some kind in some way, for all the reasons that Member Ruseau describes, but also because

683
01:10:33,883 --> 01:10:40,345
[SPEAKER_10]: It's reasonable in life to expect there to be an expectation of how long something's going to take.

684
01:10:40,545 --> 01:10:42,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Like that is the world that we live in.

685
01:10:43,186 --> 01:10:50,368
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it's also important for us to acknowledge that we haven't always done this all that well.

686
01:10:51,129 --> 01:11:01,832
[SPEAKER_10]: And in order to like earn the trust of the public, we have to set forth a parameter of how we intend to operate so that they know.

687
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:08,374
[SPEAKER_10]: so that if something goes awry, that we can be alerted that something has gone awry.

688
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:16,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think that there are times where we're not alerted that things go awry, because everybody thinks somebody knows something about it, and that's maybe not true.

689
01:11:17,059 --> 01:11:23,904
[SPEAKER_10]: So I do think for the efficacy of the process, there has to be a timeline as an important check and balance.

690
01:11:24,304 --> 01:11:31,149
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that timeline can be written such that if there is more time needed to properly investigate,

691
01:11:31,873 --> 01:11:35,576
[SPEAKER_10]: that is an acceptable thing to have happen.

692
01:11:36,277 --> 01:11:52,710
[SPEAKER_10]: But we have to be able to explain to somebody reading this document, why that would be like most people when they're something happens to their child, they think like this is going to be arbitrated, especially at elementary school, like immediately in the classroom by the teacher the next day done.

693
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:54,152
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's not the reality.

694
01:11:54,392 --> 01:12:00,377
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think we've never done a good job of educating people at just how time consuming these things are.

695
01:12:00,968 --> 01:12:06,513
[SPEAKER_10]: and why they're time-consuming and why it matters that we are taking our time to do our due diligence.

696
01:12:06,753 --> 01:12:12,598
[SPEAKER_10]: A, it's the law, B, it's the right thing to do, C, there's a lot of students, there can be a lot of students involved.

697
01:12:12,918 --> 01:12:23,848
[SPEAKER_10]: It's incumbent upon us to describe that to the users of this document so that they have an appropriate understanding.

698
01:12:24,008 --> 01:12:26,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, they will make their own requirements

699
01:12:27,094 --> 01:12:28,095
[SPEAKER_10]: of what we should do.

700
01:12:28,436 --> 01:12:33,622
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's never going to align with our reality of like just how time consuming some of this stuff is.

701
01:12:34,523 --> 01:12:34,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

702
01:12:34,924 --> 01:12:36,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's really great point.

703
01:12:36,626 --> 01:12:37,907
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. DeLava.

704
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:45,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when we're talking about timelines, I think it's more communication.

705
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:57,320
[SPEAKER_03]: certain things like, for example, at least stating we received the report, right, and having that acknowledged to the person that is filling out the report.

706
01:12:58,622 --> 01:13:06,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And then coming up with a timeline of when we will be contacting, you know, when we can

707
01:13:07,226 --> 01:13:11,273
[SPEAKER_03]: give information talking I think when, again like when we're talking timelines.

708
01:13:11,293 --> 01:13:20,107
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the most important part is making sure the communication is there with the person that filed the report, because like you said they could be lost in limbo.

709
01:13:21,257 --> 01:13:22,377
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, for a while.

710
01:13:22,617 --> 01:13:31,040
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the reverse of it too, which, um, member Graham had stated that there's also that instantaneous part where I received the bullying report.

711
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I should hear something the next day.

712
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:38,002
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that communication timeline could be something we could work in.

713
01:13:38,022 --> 01:13:43,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, uh, member Graham said, you know, if there needs to be an extension, we're communicating that too.

714
01:13:43,843 --> 01:13:47,624
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like you're communicating that I need more time regarding that.

715
01:13:47,725 --> 01:13:48,625
[SPEAKER_03]: So at least the person

716
01:13:49,645 --> 01:13:51,467
[SPEAKER_03]: that has filed the report is not in limbo.

717
01:13:53,028 --> 01:13:53,748
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

718
01:13:53,788 --> 01:14:00,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I think that that's, we could put all that on the workflow, the flowchart, I mean, excuse me.

719
01:14:02,275 --> 01:14:03,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely.

720
01:14:04,597 --> 01:14:16,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Just wanted to copy a couple of these links, because this last link that Member McLaughlin sent is, will save me the trouble of looking that up, because that is the DESE page on that.

721
01:14:17,607 --> 01:14:18,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin.

722
01:14:19,607 --> 01:14:20,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was just going to share.

723
01:14:20,528 --> 01:14:29,613
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also an excellent local plan checklist to make sure that your local plan is required.

724
01:14:29,633 --> 01:14:32,555
[SPEAKER_02]: It has all the content of what is required by law.

725
01:14:33,235 --> 01:14:39,078
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can use that, I would think, at a next meeting or when we're getting closer or at some point.

726
01:14:39,659 --> 01:14:45,382
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a pretty good checklist of whether these things are part of our plan.

727
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:46,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

728
01:14:47,443 --> 01:14:47,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

729
01:14:49,844 --> 01:15:05,795
[SPEAKER_08]: So looking at some more of this document, I suggest we convert over to the caregivers, which in Massachusetts, for those that don't know, caregivers is a legal, specific legal term.

730
01:15:06,816 --> 01:15:15,302
[SPEAKER_08]: It is preferred, and what I like about it is it may not even include guardianship, people who are

731
01:15:17,242 --> 01:15:22,063
[SPEAKER_08]: the legal responsible person, which is my understanding.

732
01:15:22,163 --> 01:15:29,685
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think getting consistent, we've been doing that on forms as we've been redoing them throughout the district.

733
01:15:31,486 --> 01:15:35,547
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that there's like a 50 or 100 places in here where that's mentioned.

734
01:15:35,607 --> 01:15:37,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Member McLaughlin, did you wanna speak up again or is your hands still up?

735
01:15:38,048 --> 01:15:39,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, great.

736
01:15:39,488 --> 01:15:45,030
[SPEAKER_08]: And so going down, students and parents,

737
01:15:46,736 --> 01:15:55,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Our caregivers will receive notice of the relevant student-related section of the plan annually, and faculty and staff at each school shall be trained annually on the plan applicable to the school.

738
01:15:57,403 --> 01:15:59,605
[SPEAKER_08]: My question was, does this actually happen?

739
01:15:59,665 --> 01:16:09,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we don't have a lot of professional development time in our schedule, so this looks very much like boilerplate, and my question to

740
01:16:10,717 --> 01:16:14,399
[SPEAKER_08]: once I can look at the DESE page, it's probably in the checklist actually.

741
01:16:14,419 --> 01:16:16,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's required.

742
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:19,622
[SPEAKER_02]: It's required to be part of the plan, Member Ruseau.

743
01:16:20,242 --> 01:16:20,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

744
01:16:20,902 --> 01:16:30,087
[SPEAKER_08]: So my question about whether it's happening, I guess we don't really need an answer, but it must be, it needs to be happening in the future.

745
01:16:30,187 --> 01:16:35,410
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was just surprised by the heaviness

746
01:16:36,149 --> 01:16:37,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Not, not that I don't think it's right, I do.

747
01:16:38,851 --> 01:16:41,594
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just with three full professional development days a year.

748
01:16:42,374 --> 01:16:49,841
[SPEAKER_07]: I was surprised to see that this is supposed to be happening annually with all staff.

749
01:16:50,902 --> 01:16:51,182
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways.

750
01:16:53,345 --> 01:16:57,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Going down, okay, there's a bunch of links that are broken.

751
01:16:58,788 --> 01:17:01,350
[SPEAKER_08]: And some of these things don't seem to exist anymore.

752
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:15,017
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will take it upon myself, if that's okay with everybody, to hunt for equivalents or to look at other district policies and see if they have replaced them with something else.

753
01:17:17,239 --> 01:17:19,260
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean,

754
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:24,922
[SPEAKER_08]: These things do link to places, but they're just not places that are there anymore.

755
01:17:26,283 --> 01:17:28,025
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Graham.

756
01:17:28,365 --> 01:17:35,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I would actually recommend that this entire section be removed because this is a policy document.

757
01:17:36,052 --> 01:17:43,940
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the policy should be that we will, that the administration will maintain

758
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:51,723
[SPEAKER_10]: uh, compiled guide about internet safety and cyber bullying and distribute it on an annual basis or something like that.

759
01:17:52,503 --> 01:17:58,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, rather than putting these links in here that again, like links change and these may.

760
01:17:58,826 --> 01:18:04,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Not like if you ask Mr. Tucci, like, does he even use these links actively?

761
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:05,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Like he may use something completely different.

762
01:18:05,968 --> 01:18:12,391
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think this, this section is just to come out, um, in favor of.

763
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:19,793
[SPEAKER_10]: requirements that the administration on an annual basis, like maintain this resource on the number of folks.

764
01:18:22,014 --> 01:18:23,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that sounds fabulous.

765
01:18:23,574 --> 01:18:28,896
[SPEAKER_08]: I will I put a can it be deleted because I'm going to have to go take a quick peek at the language of the law.

766
01:18:28,916 --> 01:18:32,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, unfortunately, you know, it may in fact be required.

767
01:18:33,818 --> 01:18:35,079
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'll find that out.

768
01:18:35,339 --> 01:18:36,600
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it can be deleted.

769
01:18:43,225 --> 01:18:49,406
[SPEAKER_07]: because it doesn't make sense in a policy, which... Member McLaughlin.

770
01:18:52,347 --> 01:18:59,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I would agree that we can have a resources section and it can say for resources, please go to the webpage.

771
01:18:59,868 --> 01:19:10,230
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need printed resources, please contact someone for folks who may have this in a print form and are not able to go to the webpage, that might be an option.

772
01:19:10,310 --> 01:19:10,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And then

773
01:19:12,556 --> 01:19:12,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

774
01:19:12,756 --> 01:19:15,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Bowen had something in the chat, member Rousseau.

775
01:19:15,637 --> 01:19:15,977
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

776
01:19:15,997 --> 01:19:16,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

777
01:19:17,717 --> 01:19:18,317
[SPEAKER_08]: So Ms.

778
01:19:18,337 --> 01:19:24,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Bowen did mention that these trainings are actually mandated and the principals provide them to all staff at the beginning of each school year.

779
01:19:25,019 --> 01:19:30,100
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm really happy that that's, I'm just going to click a little checkbox there.

780
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,461
[SPEAKER_08]: That makes me happy.

781
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:33,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

782
01:19:34,641 --> 01:19:36,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Not the being happiest goal of our meetings.

783
01:19:39,445 --> 01:19:49,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Before we move on to this next section, remember Graham had said that page 19, if that's okay, and 26, get down there.

784
01:19:51,492 --> 01:19:53,553
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I didn't make all that yellow, it's just yellow.

785
01:19:55,254 --> 01:19:58,416
[SPEAKER_08]: So wait a minute, definition of bullying.

786
01:19:58,476 --> 01:20:01,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so there's this whole other section, which is a definition of bullying again.

787
01:20:01,898 --> 01:20:07,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a different format, look at that.

788
01:20:10,758 --> 01:20:22,441
[SPEAKER_08]: If a member would like to take a look at the two definitions, let me go down to section page 26 for Kix.

789
01:20:22,461 --> 01:20:32,444
[SPEAKER_08]: 26, at least this one, not exactly the same format, but this one at least looks more like a definition section.

790
01:20:34,864 --> 01:20:36,345
[SPEAKER_08]: So would a member be,

791
01:20:37,911 --> 01:20:46,557
[SPEAKER_08]: take on the challenge of looking at the three different sections where there's definitions, deciding which one looks the best, and recommending which one we take.

792
01:20:47,378 --> 01:20:50,300
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm certainly fine with doing it, not a big task.

793
01:20:51,541 --> 01:20:57,565
[SPEAKER_08]: But rather than us going through, because it's also really hard to jump back and forth here and try and figure that out in a

794
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:14,924
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a comparison is a good idea I prefer this, then the, you know, then the narrative paragraphs I think this is the point of what we were making earlier about having subheadings and bulleting and what have you so it looks like somebody, or maybe they copied it from somewhere.

795
01:21:16,837 --> 01:21:19,258
[SPEAKER_02]: had a similar idea to make it more palatable.

796
01:21:19,278 --> 01:21:32,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think, yeah, it would be a good practice to compare to make sure that there's not one that has something that the other doesn't, with the ultimate goal of eliminating the repeat.

797
01:21:34,303 --> 01:21:34,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

798
01:21:34,763 --> 01:21:35,583
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take that on.

799
01:21:36,344 --> 01:21:38,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree just at a glance that this is definitely a better look.

800
01:21:39,305 --> 01:21:43,146
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to compare to the content of the other definitions.

801
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:50,484
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want to be mindful of time.

802
01:21:50,524 --> 01:21:51,646
[SPEAKER_10]: We have eight minutes left.

803
01:21:52,346 --> 01:22:04,520
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm wondering if I have some like overarching comments about like, I think this whole section about health education scope and sequence does not belong here and should be removed.

804
01:22:05,401 --> 01:22:07,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's another section immediately after it.

805
01:22:10,145 --> 01:22:11,906
[SPEAKER_10]: That also I think should be removed.

806
01:22:12,006 --> 01:22:14,586
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, academic and non-academic activities.

807
01:22:14,886 --> 01:22:16,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Like this doesn't belong here either.

808
01:22:16,707 --> 01:22:19,648
[SPEAKER_10]: In my opinion.

809
01:22:19,728 --> 01:22:38,013
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to see those two things be removed, but I'm just wondering if in the interest of time, if it makes sense for us to just have you start back at the top, scroll through the entire document so that everybody can see for the record, what changes exist in here today.

810
01:22:39,020 --> 01:22:48,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, and then agree on like when we will reconvene with our like respective components so that, um, the next time we come together, like we can.

811
01:22:49,268 --> 01:22:54,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Put all of those components together and then think about what's the next iteration of the document.

812
01:22:54,772 --> 01:23:01,036
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think if we could do the definitions, we could get some input from Howard about what's required and what's not.

813
01:23:01,377 --> 01:23:02,518
[SPEAKER_10]: We could do the flow chart.

814
01:23:02,578 --> 01:23:08,522
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, um, I say I would do, Oh, the district's educational obligations section, like to write that.

815
01:23:09,505 --> 01:23:13,228
[SPEAKER_10]: we would be on our way to a cohesive document.

816
01:23:14,849 --> 01:23:15,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

817
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:32,622
[SPEAKER_08]: So just unclear so going through and checking off for instance that we're going to cut this, just so when we come back we're not looking at the always being edited document, and we're sort of starting with the where we are so far, because we have the original policy we can do the comparison.

818
01:23:33,385 --> 01:23:36,448
[SPEAKER_08]: and draft something for the full committee prior to approval.

819
01:23:36,468 --> 01:23:47,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I would like to say iterations of the of the work is what we were talking about at the beginning of the meeting as well so I would like you to do a save as for this document today's date for this.

820
01:23:47,218 --> 01:23:48,499
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the version history.

821
01:23:48,519 --> 01:23:54,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Google will keep the version history so we don't have to save it as.

822
01:23:56,067 --> 01:23:59,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but then mark this as the date for that iteration.

823
01:23:59,750 --> 01:24:06,376
[SPEAKER_02]: And if, you know, you want to download it, so make sure that Google doesn't, you know, something doesn't happen with Google and whatever.

824
01:24:06,456 --> 01:24:14,183
[SPEAKER_02]: So download a copy where it has the today's date, where it's named with today's date for this iteration, instead of just relying on the Google version.

825
01:24:14,808 --> 01:24:34,663
[SPEAKER_02]: I think would be helpful so that we don't, at the risk of a technical snafu, we can still document what's been done and backtrack if we have a question or we need to verify that what we intended actually is what we ended up with so that we're all on the same page.

826
01:24:34,683 --> 01:24:36,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be helpful to have that.

827
01:24:36,064 --> 01:24:37,005
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would suggest that

828
01:24:37,818 --> 01:24:54,232
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that's fine if you got if we come with it with the edited version for next time but that we have something to compare it with today's if we need to go back and say that's not quite how I remember that I'd like to look at it and not take up until we can, we can, we can immediately just go back to any version like this is the one we started with today.

829
01:24:54,748 --> 01:24:58,412
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I know, I understand how, I know, I'm sorry, Member Ruseau, I understand.

830
01:24:58,452 --> 01:25:02,416
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't want my Google Drive to be filled with 43 versions of the same document.

831
01:25:02,696 --> 01:25:07,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then you can download it and send it in an attachment to me and I'll keep it in a file for me.

832
01:25:08,141 --> 01:25:08,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

833
01:25:08,982 --> 01:25:09,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's fine.

834
01:25:09,623 --> 01:25:10,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can do that.

835
01:25:10,524 --> 01:25:11,465
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, that would be fine.

836
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:14,087
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was something else I was gonna ask.

837
01:25:14,508 --> 01:25:14,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

838
01:25:19,463 --> 01:25:23,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, and is there a timeline for us to be completing this?

839
01:25:23,926 --> 01:25:24,987
[SPEAKER_08]: Have we discussed?

840
01:25:25,007 --> 01:25:24,987
2042.

841
01:25:25,307 --> 01:25:26,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.

842
01:25:27,609 --> 01:25:28,489
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I was kidding.

843
01:25:28,869 --> 01:25:30,250
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, no, seriously.

844
01:25:30,270 --> 01:25:34,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm serious if we're gonna, I mean.

845
01:25:34,233 --> 01:25:39,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it reasonable for us to do those takeaways meet again in a week or do we need two weeks?

846
01:25:43,139 --> 01:25:47,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if, I'm available in a week.

847
01:25:47,482 --> 01:25:47,862
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

848
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:51,367
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Robinson?

849
01:25:51,927 --> 01:25:56,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're having the bullying thing is next week on the ninth from seven to nine.

850
01:25:56,949 --> 01:26:00,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be good to have that and then come back to the table, frankly.

851
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:15,455
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say, you know, I would prefer two weeks so that we have the time to digest what's being shared with us from a training perspective from, you know, Desi and folks to make sure that we're sort of maybe getting some education and edification ourselves before coming back to the table.

852
01:26:15,475 --> 01:26:16,855
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that we could have, you know,

853
01:26:17,650 --> 01:26:22,412
[SPEAKER_02]: time to do the things that we asked committee members to do.

854
01:26:23,473 --> 01:26:35,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, time for community members and staff and others to sort of take another read through, you know, give some thought to the things that, you know, they might want to be thinking about and or looking at timelines.

855
01:26:35,178 --> 01:26:43,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I guess I would like to say, I would hope that it's not too ambitious to have at least a working document.

856
01:26:45,482 --> 01:26:46,403
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what are we in a

857
01:26:46,831 --> 01:26:47,591
[SPEAKER_02]: in March.

858
01:26:48,192 --> 01:26:53,154
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need to have a working document, especially for things that are pretty egregious.

859
01:26:53,234 --> 01:27:11,922
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say I think it's reasonable to put a working document together within a two-month deadline with the understanding that the work could be evolving, but we at least need to have something that can be presentable to the community, I would think, before the end of the school year.

860
01:27:13,722 --> 01:27:15,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Could we meet on the 14th?

861
01:27:15,905 --> 01:27:16,765
[SPEAKER_07]: which is the Tuesday?

862
01:27:20,327 --> 01:27:20,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm free.

863
01:27:33,432 --> 01:27:38,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, I have a big project on the 15th and we have to do a run through at four o'clock on that time.

864
01:27:38,574 --> 01:27:44,537
[SPEAKER_02]: I am free if we wanna do, if you guys can do like a six o'clock, I could not do the same time.

865
01:27:46,111 --> 01:27:47,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I think six o'clock is fine.

866
01:27:52,032 --> 01:27:59,234
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to request for the administrators that are on the line, that's going to put many of them at exceeding a 12-hour day.

867
01:27:59,894 --> 01:28:04,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it possible that we could keep the same time for the 16th on a Thursday?

868
01:28:04,715 --> 01:28:05,655
[SPEAKER_06]: We cannot do the 16th.

869
01:28:06,535 --> 01:28:07,816
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you cannot do the 16th.

870
01:28:08,056 --> 01:28:08,276
No.

871
01:28:11,096 --> 01:28:12,177
[SPEAKER_07]: How about the 15th?

872
01:28:12,717 --> 01:28:13,457
[SPEAKER_08]: He can't meet us.

873
01:28:14,349 --> 01:28:15,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Three to five.

874
01:28:16,511 --> 01:28:20,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I could certainly do five, but that's already kind of late to start.

875
01:28:20,994 --> 01:28:23,716
[SPEAKER_10]: The high school course selection night is also on the 15th now.

876
01:28:24,177 --> 01:28:25,498
[SPEAKER_02]: As is the transition fair.

877
01:28:25,518 --> 01:28:27,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Transition fair, yes.

878
01:28:30,542 --> 01:28:31,563
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the 21st?

879
01:28:33,224 --> 01:28:33,704
[SPEAKER_07]: Tuesday.

880
01:28:37,147 --> 01:28:37,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do that.

881
01:28:38,488 --> 01:28:38,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

882
01:28:39,709 --> 01:28:40,730
[SPEAKER_07]: I can do that as well.

883
01:28:41,190 --> 01:28:41,911
[SPEAKER_07]: I can as well.

884
01:28:48,533 --> 01:28:52,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry to anybody on the call on the meeting who really wants to be here if you can't make it.

885
01:28:52,915 --> 01:28:54,716
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we all have to be here, we'll meet in 2042.

886
01:28:54,776 --> 01:28:57,118
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to choose the 21st.

887
01:28:57,138 --> 01:28:58,458
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to recommend the 430 again.

888
01:29:07,392 --> 01:29:09,133
[SPEAKER_08]: and I'll work on that.

889
01:29:09,773 --> 01:29:23,798
[SPEAKER_08]: So the to-dos, if I have them all correctly, is that member McLaughlin is going to take a pass at a upgrade to the flowchart, correct?

890
01:29:24,678 --> 01:29:26,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, in collaboration with Dr. Cushing.

891
01:29:27,059 --> 01:29:28,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yep.

892
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:34,781
[SPEAKER_08]: And member Graham is going to take a pass at the, what was the section?

893
01:29:35,441 --> 01:29:37,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I in the wrong document?

894
01:29:38,412 --> 01:29:39,993
[SPEAKER_10]: District education obligations.

895
01:29:40,693 --> 01:29:40,973
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not.

896
01:29:41,013 --> 01:29:42,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, that's right right now.

897
01:29:45,375 --> 01:29:46,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I gotta write that down.

898
01:29:48,196 --> 01:29:49,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Low chart.

899
01:29:51,898 --> 01:29:54,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Graham is the district.

900
01:29:56,699 --> 01:29:59,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Obligation, there was something else.

901
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember Graham, I thought you said.

902
01:30:01,242 --> 01:30:06,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I thought Memogram was going to just take a look at sort of trying to make it more palatable.

903
01:30:06,204 --> 01:30:10,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know if it was like with subheadings or bulleting things that are already there.

904
01:30:10,726 --> 01:30:11,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, or.

905
01:30:11,767 --> 01:30:23,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I definitely can do that, but I think we need to answer some of these other questions before I do that, because otherwise like it's going to get pretty convoluted.

906
01:30:23,492 --> 01:30:25,773
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that happens next.

907
01:30:26,983 --> 01:30:27,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

908
01:30:27,963 --> 01:30:28,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

909
01:30:28,383 --> 01:30:40,387
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's whole sections that we can eliminate because they're repeats or whatever, that makes sense not to try to be structuring them, but just in the long, in the big picture, obviously there needs to be a structure and style.

910
01:30:46,208 --> 01:30:52,290
[SPEAKER_08]: And somehow Google does not know my own name.

911
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:55,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you also going to check in on the sections

912
01:30:57,443 --> 01:30:58,644
[SPEAKER_10]: and whether they're required.

913
01:30:59,485 --> 01:31:06,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm gonna check on sections that are required in the law.

914
01:31:10,113 --> 01:31:16,397
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can delete unnecessary stuff noted in the document.

915
01:31:17,318 --> 01:31:26,725
[SPEAKER_02]: And then may I make a recommendation, Superintendent, that Howard gets a heads up that we're doing this stuff

916
01:31:28,175 --> 01:31:31,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yeah I will reach out to him.

917
01:31:31,919 --> 01:31:47,814
[SPEAKER_06]: I, when I spoke with him earlier today it was regarding other matters, but I will let him know that this meeting is taking place, and you would like him to be able to attend so I'll try to get this on his calendar as soon as possible.

918
01:31:48,442 --> 01:31:54,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and if not attend, at least have some time for, you know, review or a synopsis or something.

919
01:31:55,449 --> 01:31:58,832
[SPEAKER_06]: I know member Ruseau said he was going to generate some questions as well.

920
01:31:59,593 --> 01:32:00,414
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah.

921
01:32:02,175 --> 01:32:06,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I have some notes in there to ask Howard and I'll, I'll write those up.

922
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:10,884
[SPEAKER_08]: And, oh yeah, so we're going to see whether these sections are

923
01:32:11,668 --> 01:32:13,709
[SPEAKER_08]: legally required, God, I hope not.

924
01:32:14,169 --> 01:32:15,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

925
01:32:16,390 --> 01:32:19,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, who was going to do the definition consolidation?

926
01:32:20,092 --> 01:32:20,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I can do that.

927
01:32:20,653 --> 01:32:21,753
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

928
01:32:23,154 --> 01:32:24,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought you said you were gonna do that, members.

929
01:32:25,715 --> 01:32:26,836
[SPEAKER_08]: I did say I was gonna do that.

930
01:32:26,896 --> 01:32:27,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, let me do that.

931
01:32:28,256 --> 01:32:29,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm happy to do it.

932
01:32:29,537 --> 01:32:34,920
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel like you have plenty of other things to do, so I can take it if you'd like.

933
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:41,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take it, because it's the easiest thing I'm gonna have to do, and I'd like to have something I can say I did and finish.

01:33:03,975 --> 01:33:10,620
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I'm going through the comments that I added and that we've added since, if there's anything additional that
