17
00:00:56,968 --> 00:01:00,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Reports of committee, 22-295 and 22-417.

18
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:03,310
[SPEAKER_15]: August 10, 2022, committee of the whole report to follow.

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:14,653
[SPEAKER_15]: This was a committee of the whole talking about different senior tax exemptions, as well as the residential tax rate.

20
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:27,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President, just want to take this opportunity really quickly, since we are here for the fall reconvening for

21
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:30,189
[SPEAKER_06]: the fall season.

22
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:37,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to say that I'm really looking forward to all of the work that we are going to be able to do.

23
00:01:37,793 --> 00:01:55,522
[SPEAKER_06]: If you followed along the first nine months of this council term, we have passed the first new zoning ordinance in 60 years, we've updated our council rules, we've passed and looked at multiple other ordinances, and we've done, I think, very difficult work under very challenging circumstances to try to

24
00:01:56,262 --> 00:02:00,023
[SPEAKER_06]: bring accountability around the budget and other things that are going on in this city.

25
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:03,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that we are going to continue along that path.

26
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:13,527
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to say that in the spirit of collaboration and working together, I think that this term is going to be, while difficult, it will be productive.

27
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:19,009
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we're successful, we can bring some good positive change to the community.

28
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:20,649
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to say that before we got going.

29
00:02:21,289 --> 00:02:23,890
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for your deference, and I appreciate it.

30
00:02:24,383 --> 00:02:25,243
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

31
00:02:26,163 --> 00:02:28,044
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I have a motion on the report to committee?

32
00:02:28,324 --> 00:02:29,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to approve.

33
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:33,345
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Bears to approve, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

34
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,085
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

35
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:35,426
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

36
00:02:35,546 --> 00:02:36,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

37
00:02:36,926 --> 00:02:37,566
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam President.

38
00:02:37,806 --> 00:02:38,486
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Bears.

39
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:40,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to take public participation.

40
00:02:42,147 --> 00:02:46,868
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Bears to take public participation out of order, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

41
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:47,749
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

42
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:48,169
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

43
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:49,309
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

44
00:02:49,449 --> 00:02:50,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

45
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,070
[SPEAKER_15]: Moving to public participation.

46
00:02:55,445 --> 00:03:00,548
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, we have one petition to the Honorable City Council of Councilors.

47
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:08,853
[SPEAKER_15]: The undersigned respectfully pray for a meeting before the Medford City Council to discuss the lack of progress of the Medford Clerical Employees Association bargaining unit.

48
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:13,735
[SPEAKER_15]: The Medford Clerical Employees Association has been without a contract for three years.

49
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:19,859
[SPEAKER_15]: Petitioner Amy C. Tanaglia, president of the Medford Clerical Employees Association, George P. Hassett Drive, 781-393-2509.

50
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:25,295
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have someone who would like to speak on this paper?

51
00:03:25,335 --> 00:03:27,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli.

52
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:28,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, I have that next.

53
00:03:28,578 --> 00:03:31,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, absolutely.

54
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:09,920
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

56
00:04:12,021 --> 00:04:13,861
[SPEAKER_15]: We'd like to proceed or we want to wait a beat.

57
00:04:15,962 --> 00:04:17,002
[SPEAKER_01]: Name and address for the record, please.

58
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Amy Tanaglia, 85 George P. Hassett Drive.

59
00:04:21,644 --> 00:04:22,384
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

60
00:04:22,464 --> 00:04:27,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to start with thanking the council for giving us a chance to explain our situation.

61
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:32,208
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been without a contract for three and a half years.

62
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:39,124
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been no increase, there's been discussions, and everything has been shot down.

63
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:47,411
[SPEAKER_01]: While the cost of living has gone up over 8%, we're asking for these raises in order to survive.

64
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:57,600
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost of living in Massachusetts has skyrocketed, and every time we've gone in front of anybody to ask for a raise, we were told that we would bankrupt the city.

65
00:04:58,772 --> 00:05:08,238
[SPEAKER_01]: With the rising costs of housing, utilities, gas, food, and medicine, it's making it impossible for us to survive on the wages that we're making.

66
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:11,800
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently we are the lowest paid clerks in the city.

67
00:05:13,622 --> 00:05:16,463
[SPEAKER_01]: During coven we were the ones that kept the city running.

68
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:29,410
[SPEAKER_01]: The city and surrounding cities shut down, but yet there were departments that made it mandatory that the clerks come in while everybody else worked from home.

69
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:34,314
[SPEAKER_01]: The clerks within the city clerk's office showed up for work every day.

70
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:36,916
[SPEAKER_01]: They were made to wear masks and gloves.

71
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:44,021
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to go out to cars that were parked outside and collect their applications, whether it be for marriage

72
00:05:44,368 --> 00:05:52,154
[SPEAKER_01]: death certificates birth certificates business licenses, and due to the closures of all the other cities, they were had to make.

73
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:57,017
[SPEAKER_01]: They had to take in marriage licenses from several surrounding cities.

74
00:05:59,018 --> 00:06:07,364
[SPEAKER_01]: The tax collector's office, obviously had to stay open and make sure all the taxes were paid the water bills were collected the building department.

75
00:06:08,657 --> 00:06:15,322
[SPEAKER_01]: started an online permitting system to make sure that all permits were applied for were issued, and the money deposited.

76
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:23,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Morale is absolutely non-existent with the secretaries clerks within City Hall.

77
00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:31,475
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been disrespected, overlooked, neglected, and underappreciated for several years.

78
00:06:33,154 --> 00:06:40,801
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to wonder now if it's that we're just considered secretaries, or is it because we're women?

79
00:06:42,382 --> 00:06:50,369
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone around us has received raises, stipends, increased sick time, but when it comes to us, we get nothing.

80
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:57,319
[SPEAKER_01]: We currently have five clerks that are the lowest classification within the city.

81
00:06:57,799 --> 00:07:03,362
[SPEAKER_01]: We have senior clerks that need reclassification to the next step of principal Clark.

82
00:07:04,283 --> 00:07:06,143
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between pay would be $49 a week.

83
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:13,714
[SPEAKER_01]: The total would be $12,740, and they still won't do it.

84
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:30,117
[SPEAKER_01]: They have created though several new positions and a new department, which budget has increased from 300, it's increased over 350,000, which you gentlemen and ladies have approved.

85
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:34,438
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time that we have our departments reclassified.

86
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,716
[SPEAKER_01]: We never get any answers.

87
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:39,237
[SPEAKER_01]: We always get lots of excuses.

88
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:42,838
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't meet with the administration.

89
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:49,041
[SPEAKER_01]: They had no time to meet with the administration, constantly canceling negotiations that they have with us.

90
00:07:51,022 --> 00:07:58,585
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very proud telling us that they have given us Juneteenth off and have put it in, that they're willing to sign that into our contract.

91
00:07:59,405 --> 00:08:01,166
[SPEAKER_01]: But everybody gets that.

92
00:08:01,406 --> 00:08:03,407
[SPEAKER_01]: That it's not that they're giving it into us.

93
00:08:03,987 --> 00:08:04,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody gets that.

94
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:15,755
[SPEAKER_01]: When we gave our first initial proposal, we were told that the next meeting we had, they would have answers to all our proposals and they would have a set of their own.

95
00:08:16,475 --> 00:08:22,600
[SPEAKER_01]: They came back rejecting the majority of our proposals and they had nothing to offer us, nothing at all.

96
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:33,108
[SPEAKER_01]: We're tired of being treated less than team players where we have proven time and again that we are dedicated employees to this city.

97
00:08:34,449 --> 00:08:36,150
[SPEAKER_01]: We demand respect.

98
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,023
[SPEAKER_01]: the respect that is shown to management and our male counterparts.

99
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:49,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the last note, I have been here and I have been an employee of the city of Medford for 22 years.

100
00:08:49,908 --> 00:08:59,254
[SPEAKER_01]: I sat down, did the math and figured out for 22 years, I have gotten a raise of 74 cents an hour extra.

101
00:09:00,074 --> 00:09:02,116
[SPEAKER_01]: How you expect people to survive on this?

102
00:09:02,996 --> 00:09:05,298
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way, there's no way.

103
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:08,924
[SPEAKER_01]: We need something done and we need it done now.

104
00:09:09,945 --> 00:09:10,385
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

105
00:09:11,206 --> 00:09:12,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

106
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

107
00:09:29,962 --> 00:09:30,962
[SPEAKER_15]: Any councilors like to speak?

108
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:33,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, if you may.

109
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:35,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

110
00:09:35,694 --> 00:09:42,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this administration's been very clear about its approach to labor relations in this community.

111
00:09:44,062 --> 00:09:49,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Quite frankly, we've seen personnel turnover, more frequently than the rooms at the Hyatt across the street.

112
00:09:50,388 --> 00:09:53,251
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, there's a human resource nightmare going on here in this community.

113
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:54,612
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an absolute nightmare.

114
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:16,129
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple months ago, we had a representative from local 25 here before us that showed us a package of 40 somewhat various labor charges, grievances, lawsuits that are pending before the city.

115
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:23,752
[SPEAKER_08]: So it brought to my attention that yet another employee has been removed from city hall by escort.

116
00:10:24,773 --> 00:10:25,973
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not the way you treat employees.

117
00:10:27,374 --> 00:10:28,535
[SPEAKER_08]: If you respect your employees,

118
00:10:29,438 --> 00:10:30,758
[SPEAKER_08]: You work with them, not against them.

119
00:10:31,118 --> 00:10:36,560
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel as though this administration has worked against a lot of the employees in this community as of recent.

120
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:44,282
[SPEAKER_08]: How much money did they spend investigating rumors on a DPW employee?

121
00:10:45,342 --> 00:10:49,523
[SPEAKER_08]: How much money we've spent reinvestigating and rehashing the Brady List issue?

122
00:10:50,823 --> 00:10:53,124
[SPEAKER_08]: On and on again, it's more about press releases than results.

123
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:57,805
[SPEAKER_08]: On and on again, it seems to me that the work that you people do is not respected.

124
00:10:59,063 --> 00:11:08,201
[SPEAKER_08]: On and on again, it seems to me that three years without a raise, three and a half years without a raise, while other bargaining units are settling and getting raises, tells us something.

125
00:11:09,042 --> 00:11:10,285
[SPEAKER_08]: It tells us something, all right?

126
00:11:11,773 --> 00:11:19,619
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the work that you guys do Amy, I worked with you, I was a bargaining rep for your union at one point in time, I think I did better than 74 cents an hour to I hope Jesus.

127
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,462
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's an average.

128
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:25,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

129
00:11:25,744 --> 00:11:35,952
[SPEAKER_08]: So, in looking at this and the approach that's going forward I mean ultimately the city council doesn't have the ability to tell the mayor to give you more money, but we can stand with you in lockstep and say that this is a good fight.

130
00:11:36,672 --> 00:11:39,493
[SPEAKER_01]: I want everybody out there to know what is actually being done.

131
00:11:39,513 --> 00:11:42,193
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we sit here day in and day out.

132
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:46,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless of who the mayor is at any point in time, we are dedicated.

133
00:11:47,235 --> 00:11:48,695
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dedicated to our jobs.

134
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:50,095
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dedicated to the city.

135
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:57,557
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think you have the luxury of closing your door and telling people that you're too busy to meet with them either.

136
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:57,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

137
00:11:58,477 --> 00:11:58,857
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

138
00:11:58,957 --> 00:12:02,698
[SPEAKER_08]: When the general public walks in off the street, you guys don't have the ability to turn them away.

139
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:05,399
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you guys have concerns and issues that you want to address,

140
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,628
[SPEAKER_08]: The door's not open for you to address those issues and concerns.

141
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,868
[SPEAKER_08]: I, as one Councilor, appreciate the work you do.

142
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:15,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that the city's only as successful as the work that you do and the commitment that you have to being a part of this team.

143
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:21,532
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a two-way street, and the administration has to show some of that respect and responsibility as well.

144
00:12:22,632 --> 00:12:32,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving forward, I certainly would never, ever, ever stand in the way of a contract race, a negotiated contract race that the union and the administration have been able to work out.

145
00:12:33,756 --> 00:12:38,941
[SPEAKER_08]: But it seems to me that right now negotiation is not the approach administration wants to take we're seeing what's going on at the school department.

146
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:43,966
[SPEAKER_08]: My teachers have been the impasse has been declared and the teachers contracts negotiations.

147
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:46,909
[SPEAKER_08]: That's one of the larger bargaining units that we have here in this community.

148
00:12:54,930 --> 00:13:05,456
[SPEAKER_08]: The work in this community that, you know, I send my two children to the public schools that sit there with these public employees for more hours of the day than they spend with me awake, right, when you think about it.

149
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:15,001
[SPEAKER_08]: So the investment that we're making in our employees here, the investment that we're making in retention of those employees that have that institutional knowledge is laughable.

150
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,162
[SPEAKER_08]: We're losing good people.

151
00:13:18,103 --> 00:13:20,264
[SPEAKER_08]: More and more, we're seeing good people being walked out the door.

152
00:13:21,404 --> 00:13:24,086
[SPEAKER_08]: More and more, we're seeing good people saying, I've had enough, I can't take it anymore.

153
00:13:25,123 --> 00:13:25,883
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're moving on.

154
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:31,164
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only people that are suffering because of that are the residents of this community.

155
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,805
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate you guys in the fight that you're putting up.

156
00:13:35,806 --> 00:13:37,286
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good fight, it's a fight worth fighting.

157
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:44,248
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll stand with you every step of the way to ensure that the administration takes the appropriate steps to show value for the work that you do.

158
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:56,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, thank you, Madam President.

159
00:13:56,415 --> 00:14:04,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, Council nights, uh, you know, comments, uh, I think, uh, hit it right on target.

160
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:17,016
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, uh, what we see is over and over again, the most important people in our community, the people that make our community run are the ones that are being neglected.

161
00:14:17,396 --> 00:14:18,097
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um,

162
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:32,762
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're talking to our brothers and sisters that are teachers or brother and sister firefighters or our secretarial staff or other departments that that are crying out and saying how do we, how do we survive.

163
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:49,135
[SPEAKER_03]: hasn't met with administration, hasn't tried to figure out strategic processes and try to figure out a way that we can get to a reasonable percentage raise.

164
00:14:50,656 --> 00:15:02,964
[SPEAKER_03]: When we're told we talk to people and try to get more invested, it's a personnel matter, which we know, but when it's phone call after phone call and person after person and family after family that are being affected,

165
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:29,126
[SPEAKER_03]: It's alarming and it's alarming to the point where we're seeing good people walk out the door, whether on their own or with assistance or whether it's teachers that are qualified and our kids love and making impacts and moving to different communities or whether it's firefighters or police officers leaving to go to different communities or our secretarial staff leaving because it's just not worth working.

166
00:15:30,487 --> 00:15:31,688
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better just to stay home.

167
00:15:32,496 --> 00:15:34,257
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just not fair for you.

168
00:15:34,277 --> 00:15:37,239
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not fair for the people that need you in your seats.

169
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:45,265
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was raised as a strong union member and understanding that

170
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:54,344
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're stronger in force and understanding that as long as we all work together, something positive has to come out of that.

171
00:15:54,984 --> 00:16:14,868
[SPEAKER_03]: So from one union member to others, we're standing with you and hoping someone listens and tries to put something forward in a positive way because I talked to a lot of teachers last night and I feel the frustration and I could feel, when you walk through this door, you can feel

172
00:16:17,552 --> 00:16:21,193
[SPEAKER_03]: the dreariness, you can feel the negative aura.

173
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:21,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's sad.

174
00:16:22,034 --> 00:16:24,895
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sad because I love this community, I love this building.

175
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,636
[SPEAKER_03]: And I apologize that you have to feel that way.

176
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:35,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, as a council, as one council, and I think most of us, if not all, we stand with you.

177
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:46,944
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to find a way to create something to make sure that all of our employees are happy and they're not leaving.

178
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:53,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think that you've already, like you said, we've already, we've already proven all of the unions behind you.

179
00:16:53,407 --> 00:17:00,837
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already proven that no matter what, we're still going to come in, you're still going to work your tail off for this community, and you're still going to do what's best for the city.

180
00:17:01,497 --> 00:17:05,362
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and I know it's getting frustrating, and it's going to be a time when

181
00:17:06,253 --> 00:17:07,634
[SPEAKER_03]: people are just going to say enough is enough.

182
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:22,283
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when someone needs a permit there's nobody there, or when someone needs a return phone call there's going to be no one there, or the children to walk into a classroom, and they're going to nobody there, or there's going to be a fire somewhere, and we're not going to have enough firefighters.

183
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:30,108
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the fears that I feel, and it's it's frightening so again, I appreciate what

184
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:37,423
[SPEAKER_03]: you did tonight for coming up, because I know it's not easy, but we're standing with you, so thank you.

185
00:17:37,643 --> 00:17:38,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

186
00:17:44,906 --> 00:17:45,666
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Madam President.

187
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:58,512
[SPEAKER_25]: My other two Councilors have been very eloquent in what they said, and being a former union employer, I think employees need to be treated with due respect, even if you have differences.

188
00:17:59,677 --> 00:18:01,779
[SPEAKER_25]: You sit down and you're talking, you're eyeing on your differences.

189
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:03,960
[SPEAKER_25]: That's what I see as I have been.

190
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,403
[SPEAKER_25]: I know I see many people in this building worked here forever.

191
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:10,145
[SPEAKER_25]: And you are the frontline workers.

192
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:15,008
[SPEAKER_25]: I know we have the police and the firemen, the frontline workers, but when a pipe breaks in the street, what do we call it?

193
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:15,929
[SPEAKER_25]: We call it the DPW.

194
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,591
[SPEAKER_25]: When you need your permit, you call, he comes around.

195
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:21,113
[SPEAKER_25]: So these are all frontline workers, everybody here.

196
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,295
[SPEAKER_25]: These are teachers that teach my grandchildren in school.

197
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,105
[SPEAKER_25]: Everyone deserves to be treated with respect.

198
00:18:27,825 --> 00:18:29,947
[SPEAKER_25]: And you're not being treated with respect.

199
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:36,292
[SPEAKER_25]: And I say, and like my other Councilor said, I stand here with you and hopefully we can get this resolved at some point.

200
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:45,980
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

201
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,863
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you so much for being here today and to all of you who are here today and for

202
00:18:51,057 --> 00:18:55,660
[SPEAKER_23]: speaking to the public and for speaking to us about what you've been going through and what you're trying to work on.

203
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:01,443
[SPEAKER_23]: I really appreciate this update as painful as it is to hear.

204
00:19:03,904 --> 00:19:08,407
[SPEAKER_23]: Like my fellow councilors, I will heartily stand with you and for your right to collectively bargain.

205
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,330
[SPEAKER_23]: To the idea that

206
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:24,897
[SPEAKER_23]: we can't find the money to pay some of our essential workers a living wage, that that would somehow cause a dire financial situation for the city.

207
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:35,221
[SPEAKER_23]: That's hard to hear because I think we all know that the work that you do is what keeps the essential functions of the city occurring.

208
00:19:36,121 --> 00:19:44,885
[SPEAKER_23]: And to blame financial hardship on a reasonable cost of living adjustment, much less the raise that you so richly deserve is,

209
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:48,491
[SPEAKER_23]: a pretty bad faith argument to make.

210
00:19:49,432 --> 00:19:59,679
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, there's a lot of situations where it feels somewhat unfortunate that all the city council can do is advocate and insist and stand with people who are campaigning for things.

211
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:04,662
[SPEAKER_23]: And this is one of those scenarios, as Councilor Knight mentioned, there are places that our jurisdiction doesn't go.

212
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:16,270
[SPEAKER_23]: Things that we can't make the administration do, but for myself as another councilor, please know that we stand with you and please keep us updated and know that we're standing in solidarity with you.

213
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:23,815
[SPEAKER_11]: I was embarrassed.

214
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:25,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

215
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:29,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe something you said really spoke to me.

216
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:32,702
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was team player.

217
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:40,628
[SPEAKER_06]: If this city is going to work, our school department is going to work from the top to the bottom, we need to be a team.

218
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:42,850
[SPEAKER_06]: And to be an effective team.

219
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:47,594
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone has to have respect for each other, and everyone needs to be able to be honest with each other.

220
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:53,190
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have that, you're not gonna have the collaboration that you need to succeed.

221
00:20:54,051 --> 00:21:09,937
[SPEAKER_06]: And what I hear every day is that people are scared to be honest in this building right now, that they're afraid to, that when they speak up, it's not gonna be, let's acknowledge that, let's take what you're saying and find the mistakes and fix the problem.

222
00:21:10,037 --> 00:21:13,418
[SPEAKER_06]: It's that when you're honest, you're gonna be punished for it.

223
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:24,324
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's not right because that destroys any semblance of bringing a team together to get the work done that this community needs to get done now I know you're doing the work every day.

224
00:21:24,945 --> 00:21:29,749
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we were working as a team, if you all felt like your voices were being heard.

225
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,612
[SPEAKER_06]: We can do things better.

226
00:21:33,272 --> 00:21:35,855
[SPEAKER_06]: We can make things better we could make the city work better.

227
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:43,715
[SPEAKER_06]: I, you know, and I'm not going to compare what we've gone through to what you've been going through because you're dealing with it, day in day out all the time.

228
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:46,878
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you watch the budget process.

229
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:53,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Earlier this year, I think you'd know that that collaboration isn't happening with us either.

230
00:21:54,546 --> 00:22:05,409
[SPEAKER_06]: For six months, this council said here are our priorities, here's what we think's going on here's our we're trying to be honest with what we would like to see action taken from this administration.

231
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:10,810
[SPEAKER_06]: And what did we hear back, either nothing, or what we're just going to do it our way.

232
00:22:11,531 --> 00:22:15,692
[SPEAKER_06]: And in my way or the highway mentality is not going to get this city where it needs to be.

233
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:34,766
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I share in Councilor Knight and Councilor Collins' frustration that all we can do, and not all we can do, but that our main role right now, at least at this point in time, is just being able to stand with you and try to be honest and sit here behind this rail and say what we think is happening.

234
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:40,708
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think we really have to ask some questions and it's about what is the plan?

235
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:49,587
[SPEAKER_06]: When someone says we can't support our workers because we have a financial problem, what is the plan to get us out of our financial problem?

236
00:22:50,688 --> 00:23:11,523
[SPEAKER_06]: What is the plan when it comes to not being able to hire people to fill all these vacancies because people don't want to come here and work because they hear in the market, I know that there are people, you know, all the way in the South coast, you know, that when people are, when cities are hiring in the South coast, they say, don't worry, it's not going to be like it is in Medford.

237
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,029
[SPEAKER_06]: 60 miles away, 90 minute drive, they know it's bad here.

238
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:17,755
[SPEAKER_06]: They know what's going on.

239
00:23:19,214 --> 00:23:32,719
[SPEAKER_06]: In this absence of leadership, I think it's on all of us to step up, and I'm happy that you're standing up, and I'm happy that all of the people in this room tonight are standing up for something better and stepping up, because if we don't do that, it's just gonna get worse.

240
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,780
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for being here.

241
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,101
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thankful for your advocacy.

242
00:23:36,121 --> 00:23:42,443
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm thankful for the advocacy and the trying to get the word out of everyone in this room on all the issues we may hear about tonight after you.

243
00:23:42,503 --> 00:23:47,105
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a lot of people who wanna speak who share very similar views to what you're sharing.

244
00:23:48,285 --> 00:24:06,204
[SPEAKER_06]: Because not enough people in the community really know what's going on and I think the more that they hear the more that they're going to be frustrated that the progress of our city is being put on hold, because, you know, the leadership of the city doesn't want to collaborate and work with its workers and its council and the residents to get things done.

245
00:24:06,284 --> 00:24:07,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for being here.

246
00:24:08,006 --> 00:24:09,848
[SPEAKER_06]: We all stand with you and we're going to do whatever we can.

247
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:18,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

248
00:24:19,428 --> 00:24:20,649
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, thank you for coming.

249
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:30,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think shining some light on an issue that not, I mean, many of our residents might know about, but it's something that's so crucial to how our city runs and how our city functions.

250
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:44,906
[SPEAKER_02]: You are who we think about when we think of city services, the city of Medford, what our city is doing to you and the people in this audience tonight, who, you know, engage with the residents of our city, make the city work.

251
00:24:45,226 --> 00:24:45,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's

252
00:24:47,294 --> 00:24:54,461
[SPEAKER_02]: It's frankly frustrating that we are at this point and that you've had to, you've, you've come to this point.

253
00:24:55,141 --> 00:25:00,126
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's, it's beginning to look like a pattern.

254
00:25:03,062 --> 00:25:20,401
[SPEAKER_02]: what we've been hearing from you guys about the treatment of employees in the city and Councilor Collins and I are newer to this job but even us we've heard from city employees about the lack of morale, the lack of negotiations, the lack of good faith when it comes to

255
00:25:22,142 --> 00:25:25,723
[SPEAKER_02]: just conversations and honesty about what's going on in the city.

256
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:36,305
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just, you know, my fellow councillors, I think have already stated it really well, but I do want to say, I very much support you guys.

257
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:38,605
[SPEAKER_02]: We as a council very much support you guys.

258
00:25:39,225 --> 00:25:47,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And while we wish we could do more than our powers allow us to, we'll be here with you guys, fighting with you guys.

259
00:25:47,747 --> 00:25:51,708
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I want you to know that you have a good ally in the city council.

260
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:52,718
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

261
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:01,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. South, are you speaking on this paper specifically?

262
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:02,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

263
00:26:02,223 --> 00:26:06,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, just we have a number of issues on public participation, so I want to make sure we get through what's on the agenda.

264
00:26:07,005 --> 00:26:08,726
[SPEAKER_15]: So please name and address for the record, please.

265
00:26:09,346 --> 00:26:09,746
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

266
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Stephen South, 106 Damon Road.

267
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:17,270
[SPEAKER_00]: President Morell, members of the city council, thank you for being here tonight.

268
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for all your work.

269
00:26:19,091 --> 00:26:20,331
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope you all had a great summer.

270
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:27,075
[SPEAKER_00]: I am also not only live in Medford but I'm also the secretary treasurer of Teamsters local 25.

271
00:26:28,196 --> 00:26:33,061
[SPEAKER_00]: We represent about eight different bargaining units within the city both on the school and the city side.

272
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:38,846
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to show solidarity with the clerical employees here in City Hall.

273
00:26:39,627 --> 00:26:55,082
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're experiencing many of the same issues that they are we're we're in collective bargaining with all of our groups, not just in my union but other unions, and the city's taking the same position and all the negotiations, and that is number one.

274
00:26:57,945 --> 00:27:08,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. nagley spoke about the inflation which today's numbers came out for August 8.3% which was even above the speculations of the economists which is incredible 8.3%.

275
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:14,518
[SPEAKER_00]: The city is now offering us 2% wage increases to all the unions.

276
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:31,887
[SPEAKER_00]: each year, but that's only if we accept a bunch of concessions, meaning, for those of you not in labor relations, we have to give back benefits that we already have in our contract benefits that everyone behind us already enjoy, we have to give those back to the city just to get 2% raises.

277
00:27:33,468 --> 00:27:38,989
[SPEAKER_00]: So you often hear people talking about all of the vacancies within the city.

278
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:48,832
[SPEAKER_00]: And last night at the council, they talked about all of the tons of teachers and paras and security people that quit over the summer that now they're shorthanded.

279
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:53,733
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can't fill those positions because there's not enough money there.

280
00:27:54,113 --> 00:27:57,434
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not enough benefits for people to support their families.

281
00:27:58,274 --> 00:28:00,394
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're having the same issue.

282
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:03,035
[SPEAKER_00]: We just organized the new parking department.

283
00:28:03,696 --> 00:28:13,468
[SPEAKER_00]: who are making deplorable wages, not very good benefits, and the city's offering us same thing, take stuff away and give you 2% wage increases.

284
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:14,450
[SPEAKER_00]: These are new employees.

285
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,352
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all looking for jobs elsewhere.

286
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:25,045
[SPEAKER_00]: The DPW and the inspectors, rec department, DPW superintendents, we represent all of them, same thing.

287
00:28:25,065 --> 00:28:29,907
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to take away a bunch of our benefits and give us menial little raises.

288
00:28:30,147 --> 00:28:33,529
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said no to almost 100% of our proposals.

289
00:28:34,269 --> 00:28:35,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't even wanna talk about them.

290
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:38,571
[SPEAKER_00]: No to all your stuff, give us concessions and little baby raises.

291
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:43,308
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you can't get anyone to take these jobs.

292
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:54,116
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, just recently, we organized right here in this building, all of the, not all, most of the department heads and assistant department heads.

293
00:28:54,236 --> 00:28:56,518
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that tell you about this administration?

294
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:03,983
[SPEAKER_00]: We have organized them, and one of the main reasons they organized is very similar to the clerks.

295
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:08,422
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not had a raise in three years.

296
00:29:09,163 --> 00:29:10,184
[SPEAKER_00]: That's disgraceful.

297
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,167
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is the result of that?

298
00:29:12,727 --> 00:29:18,114
[SPEAKER_00]: When I organized them less than a year ago, there were 20 something of them.

299
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:22,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of the positions are vacant right now, half.

300
00:29:23,601 --> 00:29:30,204
[SPEAKER_00]: And of the half that are still working, 80% of them are looking for jobs in other communities right now.

301
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:31,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, 80%.

302
00:29:32,806 --> 00:29:37,008
[SPEAKER_00]: So how is this city going to run without department heads?

303
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:41,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in the last four weeks, maybe you know, maybe you don't know.

304
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,572
[SPEAKER_00]: Last four weeks, right in this building, department heads.

305
00:29:45,812 --> 00:29:51,095
[SPEAKER_00]: The city solicitor, you all know who she is, resigned to go work somewhere else.

306
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:53,299
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's not enough pay here.

307
00:29:53,979 --> 00:30:01,121
[SPEAKER_00]: The assistant finance director, great guy, left, quit to go work somewhere else for better pay and benefits.

308
00:30:02,722 --> 00:30:07,783
[SPEAKER_00]: The assistant HR director put in her notice, she's leaving to go somewhere else.

309
00:30:08,123 --> 00:30:11,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, also because she's not treated with respect in that department.

310
00:30:11,704 --> 00:30:17,385
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a big HR nightmare like Councilor Knight said, I'll agree with him absolutely on that.

311
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:21,066
[SPEAKER_00]: And just yesterday, the elections coordinator,

312
00:30:22,098 --> 00:30:35,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandra Gale, 30 years with the city of Medford, was walked out, was told, give me your ID, give me your keys, give me your passwords, clean out your desk, you're out of here.

313
00:30:36,362 --> 00:30:39,863
[SPEAKER_00]: And the new her replacement started today, 30 years, no reason.

314
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,730
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just the way this city's going.

315
00:30:43,211 --> 00:30:49,376
[SPEAKER_00]: In the last 12 months, you name it, IT director fired, DPW director fired.

316
00:30:50,937 --> 00:30:58,644
[SPEAKER_00]: We go on and on, vacancies, we don't have a city solicitor, assistant city solicitor, we don't have an assessor, we don't have an assistant assessor.

317
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,691
[SPEAKER_00]: No IT director, no assistant IT director.

318
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:05,292
[SPEAKER_00]: How is the city running right now?

319
00:31:06,213 --> 00:31:09,174
[SPEAKER_00]: And I respect and appreciate every one of you here.

320
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:16,338
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the utmost respect and I know the parameters of your job duties and what you can and can't do.

321
00:31:16,438 --> 00:31:20,440
[SPEAKER_00]: So believe me, I wanna make sure to the general public, I'm not blaming you.

322
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,542
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you all doing an amazing job and I appreciate you.

323
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:31,332
[SPEAKER_00]: But this administration, my message to them is stop wasting money on private investigators to follow the employees.

324
00:31:31,773 --> 00:31:36,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop wasting money on arresting union officials during grievance hearings.

325
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:39,781
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop wasting money on KP law.

326
00:31:40,081 --> 00:31:45,006
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we don't even have a lawyer for the city where they're spending hundreds of dollars an hour every single day.

327
00:31:46,165 --> 00:31:49,268
[SPEAKER_00]: on stuff that a solicitor could do, or an assistant solicitor.

328
00:31:49,608 --> 00:31:52,010
[SPEAKER_00]: We are blowing hundreds of thousands of dollars.

329
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,993
[SPEAKER_00]: How about paying out millions in lawsuits?

330
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,917
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that my union, we're filing three more federal lawsuits in the next few weeks.

331
00:32:00,157 --> 00:32:02,299
[SPEAKER_15]: I do wanna keep you to time, Mr. South, if you're able to.

332
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:04,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, I'll wrap it up, and I appreciate the reminder.

333
00:32:05,622 --> 00:32:22,493
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's stop wasting money on ridiculous things like I just mentioned, and let's start paying the people let's spend money on the people that make this city run the clerks the police, the fire the DPW the teachers, everybody from the department head down to the guy that sweeps the floor.

334
00:32:23,034 --> 00:32:24,195
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to pay people.

335
00:32:25,353 --> 00:32:39,854
[SPEAKER_00]: What they deserve people, people need a proper wage and benefits to feed their families, and until that happens the city's going to continue to go in a downward spiral, and if it keeps going the way it's been going the last several weeks, you can you

336
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:44,339
[SPEAKER_00]: your bottom dollar, we may be looking at the state taking over this city.

337
00:32:44,699 --> 00:32:45,640
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a disgrace.

338
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,424
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the mayor and her administration need to take a hard look at all these things.

339
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:54,287
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not grandstanding or any political activism.

340
00:32:54,327 --> 00:32:55,408
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all facts.

341
00:32:55,488 --> 00:32:59,032
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why every time we come here, we give you packets of information.

342
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:03,317
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to take a hard look at this and start doing the right thing.

343
00:33:03,678 --> 00:33:05,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Start treating these people with respect.

344
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:11,809
[SPEAKER_00]: Until then, we'll continue to picket, we'll continue to fight, and we stand with all the workers in this city.

345
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:12,250
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

346
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:43,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak on the clerical employees association specifically?

347
00:33:43,326 --> 00:33:44,547
[SPEAKER_15]: It is the clerical.

348
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,568
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, please go ahead.

349
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:46,628
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Madam President.

350
00:33:47,449 --> 00:33:48,930
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilors, good evening.

351
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:51,012
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been before you many times.

352
00:33:53,213 --> 00:34:01,740
[SPEAKER_17]: Until yesterday, I supervised or had the privilege of supervising two of the most hardest working people in City Hall.

353
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,321
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be Ms.

354
00:34:03,361 --> 00:34:04,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Lamoni and Ms.

355
00:34:04,422 --> 00:34:04,722
[SPEAKER_17]: Brogan.

356
00:34:06,297 --> 00:34:27,701
[SPEAKER_17]: They are dedicated to their jobs, and I am not saying that any other clerical worker in this building are not dedicated to their jobs, but these two ladies put forth their best effort 365 days a year in a city that is continually changing because election laws are continually changing.

357
00:34:29,062 --> 00:34:35,063
[SPEAKER_17]: I would not only ask you to stand in solidarity with the clerical union,

358
00:34:35,561 --> 00:34:43,888
[SPEAKER_17]: But what I would ask you to do is to use your voice, your voice, your vote, your voice.

359
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:58,320
[SPEAKER_17]: Make the people of our community understand that the people who make this building run are undervalued, underappreciated and disrespected.

360
00:34:59,882 --> 00:35:01,103
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much for your time.

361
00:35:11,173 --> 00:35:19,359
[SPEAKER_15]: And is anyone else wanna speak on the Clerval Employees Association specifically, just because we do have another agenda item on public participation and I wanna give deference to that.

362
00:35:21,081 --> 00:35:21,341
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

363
00:35:21,561 --> 00:35:29,247
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just gonna move to that person and then we'll go through the rest of the... I know there's a number of people wanna speak for public participation, but there is someone on the agenda I'd like to call up.

364
00:35:29,907 --> 00:35:31,809
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna call up the person on the agenda next.

365
00:35:32,247 --> 00:35:34,031
[SPEAKER_26]: PB, David Ensign — He-Him, he-him.

366
00:35:45,275 --> 00:35:46,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, good evening.

367
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,058
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for letting me speak.

368
00:35:48,999 --> 00:35:54,405
[SPEAKER_16]: I've been reading about the new Medford parking office since they took over from pocket fit.

369
00:35:55,066 --> 00:36:03,436
[SPEAKER_16]: Many, many bad situations and no one is listening to the citizens of Medford, something has to change with this department.

370
00:36:03,976 --> 00:36:05,417
[SPEAKER_16]: as it is not going well.

371
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Here is my street sad story.

372
00:36:08,739 --> 00:36:17,143
[SPEAKER_16]: On the early morning of Saturday, September 3rd, Labor Day weekend, we woke up to a flood of tickets on our street.

373
00:36:17,803 --> 00:36:21,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Some tickets said the cars belonged to Central Air.

374
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:30,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, if that's the case and you write five, six, seven tickets with all cars saying this, you should know what street you're on.

375
00:36:32,626 --> 00:36:35,448
[SPEAKER_16]: and you should find out what the problem is.

376
00:36:36,689 --> 00:36:42,893
[SPEAKER_16]: You can see, I gave you all, you can see a ticket and a permit.

377
00:36:45,195 --> 00:36:57,383
[SPEAKER_16]: This is one of the main reasons I said at a meeting that it wasn't a good idea to get rid of the permits tickets because these scanners aren't working properly and other reasons.

378
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:02,090
[SPEAKER_16]: But wouldn't you say what is going on?

379
00:37:02,311 --> 00:37:04,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Wouldn't you stop and check it out?

380
00:37:04,413 --> 00:37:13,161
[SPEAKER_16]: If badge number 111 took the time to look at the permits on all our cars, you could clearly see something was wrong with that.

381
00:37:13,862 --> 00:37:17,945
[SPEAKER_16]: The scanner was reading as we all clearly had permits.

382
00:37:18,646 --> 00:37:21,048
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to see some retraining done.

383
00:37:21,961 --> 00:37:24,281
[SPEAKER_16]: Seems like he was told just to ticket.

384
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:27,642
[SPEAKER_16]: What a waste of taxpayer time and money.

385
00:37:28,402 --> 00:37:33,643
[SPEAKER_16]: We had to take time off from work to come down and fight these foolish tickets.

386
00:37:34,484 --> 00:37:37,444
[SPEAKER_16]: He has been up and down our street many times.

387
00:37:38,084 --> 00:37:39,244
[SPEAKER_16]: No tickets for this.

388
00:37:39,865 --> 00:37:40,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Why now?

389
00:37:41,365 --> 00:37:44,626
[SPEAKER_16]: And the new park department is blaming Park Medford.

390
00:37:45,386 --> 00:37:46,646
[SPEAKER_16]: After a year and a half,

391
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:51,168
[SPEAKER_16]: I have my visitor pass that says Stearns Ave.

392
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:58,590
[SPEAKER_16]: I applied for two senior passes with my license and registration that says Stearns Ave.

393
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,531
[SPEAKER_16]: So they do have my information.

394
00:38:02,151 --> 00:38:04,631
[SPEAKER_16]: What is going to be done about this office?

395
00:38:04,831 --> 00:38:05,992
[SPEAKER_16]: Enough is enough.

396
00:38:06,872 --> 00:38:09,654
[SPEAKER_16]: They have had plenty of time to be up and running.

397
00:38:10,214 --> 00:38:16,558
[SPEAKER_16]: The city keeps pouring money into this department and it is not working correctly.

398
00:38:17,158 --> 00:38:22,521
[SPEAKER_16]: We are taxpayers in the city of Medford and don't deserve to be treated like this.

399
00:38:23,282 --> 00:38:31,207
[SPEAKER_16]: I see a lot of out-of-state plates parked all over the city, especially in South Medford, but no tickets for them.

400
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:36,851
[SPEAKER_16]: And on the day in question, there were two on our street, no tickets for them.

401
00:38:36,871 --> 00:38:45,438
[SPEAKER_16]: I feel like we have been targeted in South Medford, and I have never felt like that in the 65 years.

402
00:38:46,219 --> 00:38:52,705
[SPEAKER_16]: The day our street was ticketed, four other abutting streets were also targeted with the same issue.

403
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:58,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Please explain to me and the citizens of Medford what can be done about this office.

404
00:38:59,368 --> 00:39:08,519
[SPEAKER_16]: They also have a camera recording citizens, but do they have one recording inside the office, when they are rude to the citizens.

405
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,483
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would like to ask our fine citizens.

406
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:19,421
[SPEAKER_16]: If they have had a problem with this office to please email the mayor and let her know.

407
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:22,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Just one more item before I end.

408
00:39:22,883 --> 00:39:29,986
[SPEAKER_16]: The PAC department now has everyone's permit passes ending on December 31st.

409
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:37,130
[SPEAKER_16]: How are they going to handle all of this at once when they couldn't handle it being staggered?

410
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:41,272
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a big question and thank you for listening to me.

411
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:41,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

412
00:39:49,677 --> 00:39:50,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

413
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:52,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for coming out because I know it's not easy.

414
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,019
[SPEAKER_03]: And we appreciate that and believe us.

415
00:39:55,479 --> 00:40:02,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I know for one concert, and I'm sure my fellow Councilors, we've all received emails and phone calls with very similar frustrations.

416
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:12,223
[SPEAKER_03]: So just to be clear, you gave us a picture that it shows for automobiles that has a ticket, a permit that's updated.

417
00:40:13,462 --> 00:40:18,766
[SPEAKER_03]: or a permit that's updated with a handicap placket, and you were all still ticketed.

418
00:40:19,046 --> 00:40:19,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

419
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:24,851
[SPEAKER_03]: And you went to the, and what was the answer from that department?

420
00:40:24,871 --> 00:40:26,472
[SPEAKER_16]: They blamed Medford.

421
00:40:27,236 --> 00:40:28,737
[SPEAKER_03]: So did they, did they fix these?

422
00:40:28,757 --> 00:40:29,858
[SPEAKER_16]: They did, they did.

423
00:40:29,998 --> 00:40:31,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's good.

424
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:31,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

425
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:44,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what we've heard is there are some that they haven't, they've asked to file, go through the appeal, they lose the appeal, and then the repercussions with that is to go to the state, which is a $250 fee anyway.

426
00:40:45,231 --> 00:40:45,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

427
00:40:45,431 --> 00:40:46,592
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's frustrating.

428
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:52,037
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're just going to pay the ticket, and is that how the city's getting money?

429
00:40:52,557 --> 00:41:06,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I know I'm just asking questions we can't put anything for amendments or recommendations but maybe we'll do this next week because I think that, again, working in a community that has a very viable and transparent

430
00:41:07,242 --> 00:41:11,064
[SPEAKER_03]: and involve traffic and parking department in that community.

431
00:41:11,504 --> 00:41:18,126
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had multiple meetings when it comes to any types of fee or fines or different changes to the rules.

432
00:41:18,807 --> 00:41:26,670
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it happens in different neighborhoods, those neighborhoods are in meetings with their department head to discuss that as community meetings.

433
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:35,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll make a recommendation next week when we can as a resolution that we recommend that our new parking department

434
00:41:35,513 --> 00:41:50,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Traffic and parking department, and their director, take major steps with our communications department to start meeting with neighborhoods, even if we go from southwest hillside, the Fulton Heights North met and break it up that way.

435
00:41:50,643 --> 00:41:56,911
[SPEAKER_03]: that they can come out and have community meetings that to discuss some of these rules because there's a lot of confusion going on.

436
00:41:57,352 --> 00:42:02,579
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that I know they said they've done something online to enlighten people, but it's just not enough.

437
00:42:02,899 --> 00:42:08,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and like you said as we move on to July, January 1, when this really hits.

438
00:42:08,746 --> 00:42:14,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I think before then we have a few months that we can still reach out to our constituents and really educate people.

439
00:42:14,912 --> 00:42:18,055
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that might help with that piece.

440
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:19,776
[SPEAKER_03]: I think transparency is very important.

441
00:42:19,816 --> 00:42:21,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that that'll be helpful.

442
00:42:21,838 --> 00:42:23,740
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I just want to make those comments.

443
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,042
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you for coming up tonight.

444
00:42:26,122 --> 00:42:26,402
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you.

445
00:42:26,442 --> 00:42:30,285
[SPEAKER_16]: And that last picture is of a car that hasn't moved for four months.

446
00:42:30,826 --> 00:42:31,847
[SPEAKER_16]: It's for sale.

447
00:42:32,928 --> 00:42:34,309
[SPEAKER_16]: No ticket ever.

448
00:42:36,502 --> 00:42:50,707
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to know we are playing a committee of the whole on September 28th with the parking department to have a general update, but also a chance to ask questions about process and questions like how are they going to process all of these permits at the end of the year?

449
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:56,790
[SPEAKER_15]: So we'll publicize that as we normally do, but we are going to host that to have an opportunity.

450
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:57,950
[SPEAKER_15]: It'll be here.

451
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,171
[SPEAKER_15]: People can come in, folks can ask questions.

452
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:01,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello.

453
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:03,552
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Madam President.

454
00:43:03,572 --> 00:43:04,353
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for coming down.

455
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:10,744
[SPEAKER_25]: Saturday morning, my phone lit up like a Christmas tree all day long, from multiple people.

456
00:43:11,544 --> 00:43:17,946
[SPEAKER_25]: And again, when you saw the permit there, you should have just say, hey, geez, I made a mistake, pull the ticket back again.

457
00:43:18,706 --> 00:43:20,587
[SPEAKER_25]: There's no need to ticket whole streets.

458
00:43:20,627 --> 00:43:23,707
[SPEAKER_25]: You're not the only street where they've gone and tagged an entire street.

459
00:43:24,027 --> 00:43:27,368
[SPEAKER_25]: I've heard that from multiple other streets, entire streets have got tagged.

460
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:33,170
[SPEAKER_25]: This is an apartment that needs more training, both in

461
00:43:35,271 --> 00:43:38,713
[SPEAKER_25]: customer service and their job.

462
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:42,196
[SPEAKER_25]: I thank the president who's gonna have a meeting.

463
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:47,660
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm gonna have a different opinion on that the following week, but it isn't just Yacht Street, Southern Streets.

464
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,862
[SPEAKER_25]: I got calls from the businesses in Haines Square.

465
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:59,808
[SPEAKER_25]: And I watched people pull up into parking spots that weren't there three minutes and they were tagging them.

466
00:43:59,828 --> 00:44:02,550
[SPEAKER_25]: And I went over to him, he says, why are you tagging this guy?

467
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,452
[SPEAKER_25]: She's been here less than three minutes.

468
00:44:05,308 --> 00:44:06,769
[SPEAKER_25]: These are fake signs, he said to me.

469
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:09,670
[SPEAKER_25]: I said, they're not fake signs, they're signs put up by the city.

470
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:14,652
[SPEAKER_25]: And this has gone on for weeks over in Haines Square.

471
00:44:14,912 --> 00:44:23,195
[SPEAKER_25]: You're right, when we had Park Method, they mostly concentrated in the business area.

472
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:29,358
[SPEAKER_25]: I haven't gotten a call from one business yet because Park Method never went into the neighborhoods.

473
00:44:30,218 --> 00:44:31,679
[SPEAKER_25]: These are people going into the neighborhoods

474
00:44:32,463 --> 00:44:35,465
[SPEAKER_25]: that what I say where we've never been before.

475
00:44:35,785 --> 00:44:45,851
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe some of the tickets are legitimate, but we're getting ticky tack tickets for not having that little sticker on your plate, or maybe you're more than 12 inches from the curb.

476
00:44:47,432 --> 00:44:53,496
[SPEAKER_25]: I think the whole department needs to maybe shut down for a little while and be retrained in multiple different areas.

477
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:57,578
[SPEAKER_25]: And I'm gonna make that suggestion when the president calls for the committee.

478
00:44:57,898 --> 00:44:59,099
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry for what you had to go through.

479
00:45:00,003 --> 00:45:02,785
[SPEAKER_25]: My street will probably get ticketed tomorrow like they did last time I complained.

480
00:45:03,385 --> 00:45:06,167
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'll keep an eye out tomorrow.

481
00:45:07,808 --> 00:45:08,128
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

482
00:45:08,148 --> 00:45:08,649
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

483
00:45:08,689 --> 00:45:09,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

484
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:15,013
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the end of public participation.

485
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:15,934
[SPEAKER_15]: That's on the agenda.

486
00:45:15,994 --> 00:45:19,356
[SPEAKER_15]: If anyone would like to speak for public participation, please, please come up to the mic.

487
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:21,217
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll defer to you.

488
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:32,716
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello, hi, this is- Just name and address for the record, please.

489
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:36,059
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you just lean a little bit closer to the mic?

490
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:37,300
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm having trouble hearing you.

491
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:37,840
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

492
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,222
[SPEAKER_21]: He's from Wellington Woods Condo Complex.

493
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:41,563
[SPEAKER_15]: for that.

494
00:45:41,643 --> 00:45:44,806
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, for the come here for the noise.

495
00:45:44,906 --> 00:45:45,146
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

496
00:45:45,706 --> 00:45:47,708
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, for the monogram.

497
00:45:48,248 --> 00:45:58,356
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, we have reported this issue to City Council back in August, and the building department have issued the violation letter to the to the facility.

498
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:01,419
[SPEAKER_21]: But so far, I did not see any improvement.

499
00:46:01,479 --> 00:46:04,421
[SPEAKER_21]: We still hear the over over then a lot of noise

500
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,121
[SPEAKER_21]: And they really affect us.

501
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:10,123
[SPEAKER_21]: So I want to know what city can can do to help us.

502
00:46:11,264 --> 00:46:11,864
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have been.

503
00:46:12,345 --> 00:46:13,505
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been in touch with the mayor about this.

504
00:46:13,525 --> 00:46:20,010
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I've been trying to speak with the mayor about this first of all because when the council did hear this I know we very much had concerns

505
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:26,174
[SPEAKER_15]: about noise specifically about trucks I believe it's the refrigerator trucks that are part of the issue as well as the cooling towers.

506
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:34,199
[SPEAKER_15]: The mayor told me they have reached out to the owners, and I believe the next steps are to go through the Board of Health and code enforcement.

507
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:46,947
[SPEAKER_15]: I was told from the administration that the issue is that this was has been a bakery space for decades, and the special permit for the hours Councilor you can correct me if I'm wrong you see you staring at me.

508
00:46:48,704 --> 00:46:51,468
[SPEAKER_15]: went in 1995, they said it went with the business.

509
00:46:51,868 --> 00:47:05,017
[SPEAKER_15]: So because it was not spoken up since the last since the origination of that special permit with the license, the special hours have carried with the business so long as it remains a bakery, but still they still have to comply with decibel levels.

510
00:47:05,778 --> 00:47:11,361
[SPEAKER_15]: So, the mayor has told me that code enforcement and the Board of Health will be out there to ensure that they are complying.

511
00:47:12,502 --> 00:47:19,967
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have as a council we don't have direct control, but we absolutely can lean on the mayor I've spoken to the mayor I don't know about a fellow Councilor speaking to the mayor to

512
00:47:21,288 --> 00:47:28,093
[SPEAKER_15]: to get the code enforcement and get the Board of Health out there to comply with the noise regulations in that area.

513
00:47:29,437 --> 00:47:32,458
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I don't have any other Councilors were able to get any other updates.

514
00:47:32,658 --> 00:47:35,119
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I will, I will absolutely say on this, I have your email.

515
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:40,822
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, please let me know any, I mean, you know, every time I know it's ongoing, please keep me in the loop.

516
00:47:40,842 --> 00:47:41,862
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll keep pushing on this.

517
00:47:42,102 --> 00:47:43,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I'm going to follow up again with the mayor tomorrow.

518
00:47:43,983 --> 00:47:48,344
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't, you know, when this company came before us, they were very responsive.

519
00:47:48,424 --> 00:47:53,186
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's frustrating to me now that it seems like they're having a hard time getting in touch with the company.

520
00:47:53,867 --> 00:47:54,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, so

521
00:47:55,556 --> 00:47:56,477
[SPEAKER_15]: That is the process.

522
00:47:56,517 --> 00:48:02,101
[SPEAKER_15]: I wish I had a better answer for you, but it's very much a known issue and ideally they are working on it.

523
00:48:02,202 --> 00:48:03,222
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm told they're working on it.

524
00:48:03,603 --> 00:48:11,049
[SPEAKER_15]: I will keep leaning on them to make sure that this is something they address because they can't have that loud of a decibel overnight at all hours of the night.

525
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,501
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, can this be put on the next meeting agenda?

526
00:48:14,821 --> 00:48:18,684
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, can you please put agenda put on the next agenda?

527
00:48:19,504 --> 00:48:21,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, would any Councilor like to do that?

528
00:48:21,906 --> 00:48:22,666
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm happy to.

529
00:48:23,387 --> 00:48:24,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, we'll make sure it's on the next agenda.

530
00:48:24,888 --> 00:48:25,688
[SPEAKER_15]: So that would be in two weeks.

531
00:48:25,728 --> 00:48:27,069
[SPEAKER_15]: And yep, we can speak to it.

532
00:48:27,189 --> 00:48:27,369
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

533
00:48:27,389 --> 00:48:28,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

534
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:28,530
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

535
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:31,792
[SPEAKER_15]: I have.

536
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,316
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

537
00:48:37,436 --> 00:48:38,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone else?

538
00:48:41,383 --> 00:48:43,924
[SPEAKER_15]: Just name and address for the record, please.

539
00:48:44,024 --> 00:48:46,224
[SPEAKER_12]: Rick Sacco, 21 Ridgeway Road Method.

540
00:48:46,505 --> 00:48:49,445
[SPEAKER_12]: My story starts very simply.

541
00:48:49,565 --> 00:48:50,926
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a tree in front of my house.

542
00:48:51,486 --> 00:48:52,506
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a Norwood maple.

543
00:48:52,526 --> 00:48:53,667
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very nice tree.

544
00:48:54,427 --> 00:48:55,587
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on city property.

545
00:48:55,607 --> 00:49:07,751
[SPEAKER_12]: I went down to the DPW because I was concerned about some serious overhanging of some limbs that I felt that were a danger to the public, a safety issue.

546
00:49:08,572 --> 00:49:15,033
[SPEAKER_12]: So I went to the DPW and I asked them if they could have a city go down and trim those limbs off the tree.

547
00:49:16,594 --> 00:49:18,914
[SPEAKER_12]: I was told that I own the tree.

548
00:49:20,354 --> 00:49:22,395
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, I own a city tree.

549
00:49:22,855 --> 00:49:25,195
[SPEAKER_12]: She said, yeah, well, you own a private way.

550
00:49:25,215 --> 00:49:25,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, yeah.

551
00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:34,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I guess the ordinance says that if you own a private way and you have a tree in front of your house, you own that tree.

552
00:49:34,827 --> 00:49:41,589
[SPEAKER_12]: you are responsible for that tree, unless it's a public safety issue, then the city will come in and trim the tree.

553
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:55,374
[SPEAKER_12]: So I said, well, I'm gonna go out and get a quote from a tree service company, which they came out and I'll read the quote.

554
00:49:56,654 --> 00:49:58,435
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a very reputable company.

555
00:49:59,648 --> 00:50:07,251
[SPEAKER_12]: It says a safety pruning of a Norway maple, remove large dead wood, rotting and weak branches.

556
00:50:07,532 --> 00:50:09,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Perform a weight reduction when necessary.

557
00:50:10,413 --> 00:50:12,274
[SPEAKER_12]: Clean up wood and brush.

558
00:50:13,094 --> 00:50:13,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Gave me a price.

559
00:50:13,834 --> 00:50:18,076
[SPEAKER_12]: So I take this down to the DPW commissioner.

560
00:50:19,097 --> 00:50:20,597
[SPEAKER_12]: They go into the office, they look at it.

561
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:26,520
[SPEAKER_12]: They come out, basically says to me, well, the quote doesn't say public safety issue.

562
00:50:27,841 --> 00:50:28,281
[SPEAKER_12]: So what do you mean?

563
00:50:29,164 --> 00:50:31,626
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, it has to say public safety, it's a public safety.

564
00:50:33,267 --> 00:50:38,370
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, so the word public, if it's not on the quote, that means I don't get the tree tripped.

565
00:50:39,731 --> 00:50:48,257
[SPEAKER_12]: So my question is this, anybody that has a tree that's on a private way in the city of Medford, they own that tree.

566
00:50:48,618 --> 00:50:54,181
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want the people to know that's listening in, that this is a new ordinance that has to be changed.

567
00:50:54,922 --> 00:50:56,083
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a simple thing to do.

568
00:50:57,031 --> 00:51:04,955
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not asking for sewers, I'm not asking for curbing, because a public way requires curbing and sewage.

569
00:51:05,575 --> 00:51:07,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Private ways do not require that.

570
00:51:08,216 --> 00:51:10,177
[SPEAKER_12]: But all I'm looking for is to have my tree trimmed.

571
00:51:10,738 --> 00:51:11,858
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it, all right?

572
00:51:12,399 --> 00:51:20,442
[SPEAKER_12]: The other issue, which doesn't have to do with trees, and I wanna make the public aware of this, that live on private ways, is that if,

573
00:51:24,777 --> 00:51:40,146
[SPEAKER_12]: If your street is torn up from excessive traffic, and it's a private way, and that street has to be repaved, the cost of that repaving is done by the people that live on that street, not by the city.

574
00:51:42,768 --> 00:51:44,369
[SPEAKER_12]: The public way is different.

575
00:51:45,317 --> 00:51:57,483
[SPEAKER_12]: So I live on Ridgeway Road, I'm getting off in a little bit here, but I live on Ridgeway Road, and between six and nine o'clock, 10 o'clock in the morning, there's 80 to 100 cars that go down that street.

576
00:51:57,884 --> 00:51:58,784
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a private way.

577
00:51:58,944 --> 00:52:03,367
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that street is getting worn, you can see cracks in the street.

578
00:52:04,307 --> 00:52:09,670
[SPEAKER_12]: If that street gets deteriorated to the point of rebating, we have to pay for that.

579
00:52:10,383 --> 00:52:25,133
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just want the public to know this, but all I'm asking for is the council to go into committee or rules and just very simply say, if you live on a private way and you have a tree in front of your house, the city will trim it.

580
00:52:25,965 --> 00:52:26,945
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll replace it if necessary.

581
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:36,008
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have Commissioner McGibbon on the call because I've had instances, I live on a private way too, I've actually had neighbors that have been told the exact opposite.

582
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:45,191
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to, if Commissioner McGibbon, he's here for another reason, but I don't know, Commissioner McGibbon, if you're... If we can't do it, I know we're focusing on

583
00:52:45,771 --> 00:53:00,416
[SPEAKER_03]: looking to change that policy now because of the lack of federal funding, because we have so many private ways in this community that we're looking to eliminate the private way, and that would eliminate any of those concerns, Mr. Sacco.

584
00:53:00,476 --> 00:53:01,676
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to take time.

585
00:53:01,736 --> 00:53:06,418
[SPEAKER_03]: It does, but this is the reason the community should know as well.

586
00:53:07,078 --> 00:53:12,240
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why we should, you know, there's so many different factors to this.

587
00:53:13,695 --> 00:53:31,580
[SPEAKER_03]: this situation to help our community, whether it's more funding from the government to repave streets or having issues like this where, you know, DPW's hands are tied because these, this rules that need to be changed that say that we can't trim a tree that has public safety concerns.

588
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:37,582
[SPEAKER_03]: So, because we do have, we do have students still walking down that street to go to school when it's walk Metro day.

589
00:53:37,662 --> 00:53:40,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's under a tree that's that safe, I hope that

590
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:42,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. McGiven can help us with that.

591
00:53:42,544 --> 00:53:52,432
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner McGiven, if you could clarify what the ownership is of trees on private ways that might be, you know, abutting the street.

592
00:53:53,988 --> 00:53:55,329
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm happy to, Madam President.

593
00:53:55,569 --> 00:53:58,510
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm happy to, Madam President.

594
00:53:59,211 --> 00:54:00,751
[SPEAKER_24]: So this does come up quite often.

595
00:54:01,152 --> 00:54:05,114
[SPEAKER_24]: We don't actually rule if a tree is in a private way, who owns it.

596
00:54:05,254 --> 00:54:08,575
[SPEAKER_24]: We just determine if we are responsible for it or not.

597
00:54:08,936 --> 00:54:16,259
[SPEAKER_24]: So in other words, we answer the question, is this tree under the care and control of the city or is this under the care and control of somebody else?

598
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,600
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's what we're doing.

599
00:54:17,620 --> 00:54:19,981
[SPEAKER_24]: We're not saying it's your tree or it's her tree

600
00:54:21,962 --> 00:54:31,330
[SPEAKER_24]: or whatever, we're just saying, oh, that doesn't meet chapter 87 definition of a public shade tree, or it's not a publicly owned tree on public property.

601
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,771
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's something other than that.

602
00:54:34,112 --> 00:54:35,553
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just want to clarify that.

603
00:54:36,374 --> 00:54:40,036
[SPEAKER_24]: And then as far as trimming trees on private ways, we do actually do that.

604
00:54:41,317 --> 00:54:50,625
[SPEAKER_24]: If the branch is hanging over the private way, because the public actually has rights in the public way, and we would protect those rights.

605
00:54:51,045 --> 00:54:52,006
[SPEAKER_24]: So we do that quite often.

606
00:54:52,046 --> 00:54:55,448
[SPEAKER_24]: So there's a private way and there's a limb hanging off.

607
00:54:56,249 --> 00:54:58,630
[SPEAKER_24]: And we usually don't know who the owner of the tree is.

608
00:54:59,771 --> 00:55:00,831
[SPEAKER_24]: If we do, we notify the owner.

609
00:55:00,912 --> 00:55:05,214
[SPEAKER_24]: But if we don't, then we remove the tree on behalf of the safety of the public.

610
00:55:05,575 --> 00:55:07,676
[SPEAKER_24]: We do the same thing on private ways with potholes.

611
00:55:08,356 --> 00:55:13,220
[SPEAKER_24]: And also, I believe we plow private ways so emergency vehicles can get in and out.

612
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:28,170
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's a really sort of very quick summary, but I do recall this instant, and I do recall that we determined that the work on the tree or the issue at hand wasn't an immediate threat to the public.

613
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:35,414
[SPEAKER_24]: Therefore, the city wouldn't have a right under the law to go do anything to that tree because it's not under our care and control.

614
00:55:36,075 --> 00:55:37,016
[SPEAKER_24]: Hopefully that makes sense.

615
00:55:38,497 --> 00:55:38,957
[SPEAKER_12]: It does.

616
00:55:39,317 --> 00:55:42,599
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand what you're saying, but my question also is the liability.

617
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:53,596
[SPEAKER_12]: What happens if a limb falls off that tree and lands on someone's head that's walking underneath the tree and they're seriously injured?

618
00:55:53,696 --> 00:55:57,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's liable?

619
00:55:57,379 --> 00:56:01,462
[SPEAKER_12]: Me, the person that the tree's in front of or the city?

620
00:56:01,842 --> 00:56:02,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the city liable for that?

621
00:56:03,263 --> 00:56:11,669
[SPEAKER_12]: If that limb comes down and hits somebody and damages a person or a car or whatever, am I responsible or is the city responsible?

622
00:56:12,256 --> 00:56:15,237
[SPEAKER_12]: You're saying, the city's saying that it's not danger.

623
00:56:15,757 --> 00:56:22,779
[SPEAKER_12]: So what happens if we get a windstorm and that limb, and these are big limbs, and it comes down and it takes somebody out, who's responsible?

624
00:56:23,019 --> 00:56:23,940
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not gonna be responsible.

625
00:56:23,960 --> 00:56:25,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you able to address that, Commissioner McGivern?

626
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:28,861
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's another issue that maybe somebody should be looking at too.

627
00:56:29,161 --> 00:56:32,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's liable on that kind of a situation?

628
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:34,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I have- We can let him answer.

629
00:56:36,094 --> 00:56:36,855
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Madam President.

630
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:39,216
[SPEAKER_24]: No, we don't make determinations on liability.

631
00:56:39,477 --> 00:56:40,657
[SPEAKER_24]: That would definitely be legal.

632
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:46,582
[SPEAKER_24]: What we do do is make a reasonable assessment of the risk to the public on a hanging limb on a private tree.

633
00:56:46,622 --> 00:56:50,305
[SPEAKER_24]: So if we feel that that the immediate threat to the public that can't be resolved.

634
00:56:51,379 --> 00:56:58,206
[SPEAKER_24]: in a matter of time by the owner, or you might not know the owners, we do react to that situation and remove the limb.

635
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:08,017
[SPEAKER_24]: Every other scenario about weighing liabilities, I'm not gonna weigh in on, and who owns a tree and who owns liability and all that, it's a lot of nuance in the law.

636
00:57:08,037 --> 00:57:10,600
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

637
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:12,815
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

638
00:57:12,855 --> 00:57:14,616
[SPEAKER_15]: I hope that it addressed some of your questions.

639
00:57:14,736 --> 00:57:18,277
[SPEAKER_12]: I know it's- I'm happy to revisit it again.

640
00:57:18,597 --> 00:57:24,620
[SPEAKER_24]: Sir, if you believe that it is a truly a threat to the public that's immediate, that needs to be resolved, we will revisit that with you.

641
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,501
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm not gonna deny that for sure.

642
00:57:26,581 --> 00:57:28,321
[SPEAKER_12]: If there needs to be- I understand.

643
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:31,143
[SPEAKER_12]: I had the tree warden come out and look at it.

644
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:34,004
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that she determined it's not.

645
00:57:35,044 --> 00:57:35,805
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

646
00:57:36,145 --> 00:57:41,587
[SPEAKER_12]: But I have a professional tree company that's been in business 30 years that says, yes, it is a safety issue.

647
00:57:42,388 --> 00:57:52,738
[SPEAKER_24]: And I'm- It could be a safety issue on the private side, it could be a safety, there's a tree on private land that is creating a threat, not in an area that's- City property, it's on the sidewalk.

648
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:54,981
[SPEAKER_24]: Like I said, we'll revisit that with you, for certain.

649
00:57:55,081 --> 00:58:00,666
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's an immediate threat to the public- I'd appreciate it if you'd look at it again and make another determination on it.

650
00:58:01,327 --> 00:58:03,269
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, we'll go through the tree warden.

651
00:58:03,429 --> 00:58:04,410
[SPEAKER_24]: We will go through the tree warden.

652
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:05,030
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate it.

653
00:58:06,832 --> 00:58:07,292
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

654
00:58:07,312 --> 00:58:07,652
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

655
00:58:07,712 --> 00:58:26,720
[SPEAKER_15]: And like Councilor Caraviello said, just for the edification of the public, we're looking at, the city is looking at both private and public ways, and Councilor Caraviello has asked for a meeting around that to see what can be done to, because there are so many private ways within the city, as well as we are working on a tree ordinance that's lots of things to consider.

656
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,461
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing is, it's a nice tree.

657
00:58:29,642 --> 00:58:35,344
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a Norwood maple, and I really want to save the tree, because I figure if I could take these limbs down,

658
00:58:35,824 --> 00:58:37,345
[SPEAKER_12]: it's only going to give growth to the tree.

659
00:58:37,965 --> 00:58:44,330
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not like I'm, you know, it's more than, it's a safety issue, but it's also an issue where I want to save that tree.

660
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:44,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.

661
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:45,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course.

662
00:58:45,711 --> 00:58:46,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

663
00:58:46,251 --> 00:58:46,891
[SPEAKER_12]: I appreciate it.

664
00:58:46,931 --> 00:58:49,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

665
00:58:49,813 --> 00:58:51,594
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone else who'd like to, Councilor Caraviello.

666
00:58:51,614 --> 00:58:52,515
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Madam President.

667
00:58:52,655 --> 00:58:53,976
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Sacco, thank you for coming down.

668
00:58:55,637 --> 00:59:00,620
[SPEAKER_25]: This is an issue that I brought up at the last meeting and it's, it's gone to our rules committee.

669
00:59:01,321 --> 00:59:02,141
[SPEAKER_25]: I want a definition.

670
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:05,401
[SPEAKER_25]: on to what a private way is.

671
00:59:05,421 --> 00:59:13,184
[SPEAKER_25]: I want to know what the city is responsible for and what the property owners are responsible for.

672
00:59:13,244 --> 00:59:27,430
[SPEAKER_25]: And if they're not entitled to the same benefits that the regular taxpayer is, then the people who live on these private ways should be classified at a lower tax rate, seeing if they're not going to get the same benefits that someone who lives on the public way is.

673
00:59:29,357 --> 00:59:30,898
[SPEAKER_25]: There will be a meeting very soon.

674
00:59:31,658 --> 00:59:33,019
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not on that particular committee.

675
00:59:33,079 --> 00:59:34,680
[SPEAKER_25]: I think Councilor Bears is on that committee.

676
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,841
[SPEAKER_25]: And that'll be discussed that night.

677
00:59:37,861 --> 00:59:39,682
[SPEAKER_25]: I'll be here that night to help on that.

678
00:59:40,102 --> 00:59:43,464
[SPEAKER_25]: But again, something I brought up a few weeks ago.

679
00:59:43,744 --> 00:59:48,867
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't think it's fair that young people like you, myself, Councilor Murray, we all live in private ways.

680
00:59:49,247 --> 00:59:54,369
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know what benefit I get out of it other than I paid to pave my own street when it had to be paved.

681
00:59:56,872 --> 01:00:03,515
[SPEAKER_25]: If these residents are going to get the same benefits that the other people are paid the same tax rate, maybe they should be classified different in the lower rate.

682
01:00:04,775 --> 01:00:05,515
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

683
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,396
[SPEAKER_15]: But anyone else like to speak for public participation.

684
01:00:12,598 --> 01:00:13,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your patience.

685
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:16,639
[SPEAKER_26]: All right, thank you.

686
01:00:20,411 --> 01:00:23,012
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Nicole Morell, President Morell and city councils.

687
01:00:23,212 --> 01:00:28,814
[SPEAKER_26]: Just like to speak a little bit about union contracts and other contracts in the city of Medford.

688
01:00:30,194 --> 01:00:36,676
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm aware of one bargaining unit that does not have an expired contract in the city right now.

689
01:00:36,936 --> 01:00:42,358
[SPEAKER_26]: And the chief just made me aware that that's the crossing guards who just ratified their agreement today.

690
01:00:43,118 --> 01:00:46,759
[SPEAKER_26]: Every other union in the city of Medford has an expired contract.

691
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:49,900
[SPEAKER_26]: The PAC has an expired contract.

692
01:00:50,825 --> 01:00:52,245
[SPEAKER_26]: We have many grievances.

693
01:00:52,686 --> 01:00:54,286
[SPEAKER_26]: Other unions have many grievances.

694
01:00:55,386 --> 01:00:56,547
[SPEAKER_26]: The PEC has a grievance.

695
01:00:57,427 --> 01:00:58,927
[SPEAKER_26]: None of these things are getting settled.

696
01:01:02,568 --> 01:01:04,149
[SPEAKER_26]: PEC is a public employee coalition.

697
01:01:04,189 --> 01:01:05,729
[SPEAKER_26]: It's the insurance for the entire city.

698
01:01:10,071 --> 01:01:13,812
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, we negotiated the health insurance agreement.

699
01:01:14,632 --> 01:01:15,172
[SPEAKER_26]: Expired.

700
01:01:15,912 --> 01:01:17,113
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a grievance also.

701
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:18,413
[SPEAKER_26]: That's unsettled.

702
01:01:19,968 --> 01:01:30,295
[SPEAKER_26]: I know of one contract in the city of Medford that has been settled by this administration, other than the Crossing Guides, and that was left over from the previous administration.

703
01:01:31,476 --> 01:01:38,021
[SPEAKER_26]: Sister Tanaglia from the Clerk Reunion described the exact bargaining sessions that we have.

704
01:01:39,241 --> 01:01:40,342
[SPEAKER_26]: Same thing happens with us.

705
01:01:40,462 --> 01:01:47,067
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm sure anybody else that sits at the bargaining table can reiterate that that's what happens at all of these sessions.

706
01:01:48,998 --> 01:01:53,761
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not sure who's responsible for settling these contracts, but whoever it is, it's not getting done.

707
01:01:55,462 --> 01:01:57,624
[SPEAKER_26]: We talk about funding, I'll go on to funding.

708
01:01:57,704 --> 01:02:00,065
[SPEAKER_26]: We talk about funding a lot, and funding is always an issue.

709
01:02:01,546 --> 01:02:06,589
[SPEAKER_26]: The state has a $5 billion surplus of state tax revenue.

710
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:12,933
[SPEAKER_26]: They just released a supplemental budget of $840 million on the 31st of August.

711
01:02:13,774 --> 01:02:15,675
[SPEAKER_26]: Does anybody know what the city of Medford share was?

712
01:02:18,471 --> 01:02:20,431
[SPEAKER_26]: Did we put in for it, did we ask for anything?

713
01:02:22,672 --> 01:02:23,852
[SPEAKER_26]: Might have been a good idea.

714
01:02:23,872 --> 01:02:27,073
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm just not sure about it, I don't really know.

715
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:32,294
[SPEAKER_26]: The other thing is we have been asking for a grant writer for many years, City of Medford.

716
01:02:35,354 --> 01:02:35,754
[SPEAKER_26]: What's that?

717
01:02:37,155 --> 01:02:38,635
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, yeah, back in the day.

718
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:42,816
[SPEAKER_26]: Another great idea, I don't think we have one again.

719
01:02:43,776 --> 01:02:47,777
[SPEAKER_26]: A neighbor in the City of Medford, Tufts University,

720
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,843
[SPEAKER_26]: not sure what they're contributing, it'd be nice for them to help out in these times.

721
01:02:55,164 --> 01:03:01,268
[SPEAKER_26]: As far as negotiating and selling agreements, we have KP Law coming in to do that.

722
01:03:02,889 --> 01:03:07,031
[SPEAKER_26]: KP Law is, looks like they're a city solicitor.

723
01:03:07,812 --> 01:03:14,176
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd love to get a copy of KP Law's contract with the city, what their billable hour rate is,

724
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,082
[SPEAKER_26]: and what they've been paid to date.

725
01:03:17,622 --> 01:03:21,987
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd asked the city solicitor but apparently we don't have one.

726
01:03:22,047 --> 01:03:24,509
[SPEAKER_26]: Just to just to let you guys know what's going on here.

727
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:26,752
[SPEAKER_26]: I would love to work with the city.

728
01:03:27,152 --> 01:03:28,774
[SPEAKER_26]: I would love to settle our contract.

729
01:03:29,735 --> 01:03:31,677
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't think anybody's going to settle the contract.

730
01:03:32,418 --> 01:03:38,224
[SPEAKER_26]: The teachers are in mediation at the request of the school committee.

731
01:03:41,993 --> 01:03:45,736
[SPEAKER_26]: They didn't want this, we don't want to go to arbitration, but that's where we're going to end up.

732
01:03:47,217 --> 01:03:48,578
[SPEAKER_26]: This is how we do business here.

733
01:03:49,038 --> 01:03:53,862
[SPEAKER_26]: Unfortunately, sad to say, like to see some changes here I'd like to see some grievances settled.

734
01:03:53,882 --> 01:03:57,044
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know by who, I guess KP law is going to have to do that.

735
01:03:57,064 --> 01:04:02,087
[SPEAKER_26]: This business looks good for KP law.

736
01:04:02,908 --> 01:04:09,953
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like for some of the somebody administration somebody at City Hall who maybe was hired to do that, to do that work.

737
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,686
[SPEAKER_26]: but I don't know what's gonna happen.

738
01:04:12,986 --> 01:04:15,371
[SPEAKER_26]: I would love to see some progress on these issues.

739
01:04:16,273 --> 01:04:20,220
[SPEAKER_26]: I thank you for the forum and I thank you for your dedication and hard work.

740
01:04:21,062 --> 01:04:21,422
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

741
01:04:28,742 --> 01:04:31,144
[SPEAKER_25]: want to answer this question.

742
01:04:31,204 --> 01:04:31,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

743
01:04:32,225 --> 01:04:35,228
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you for coming up on wishing us about KP law.

744
01:04:35,948 --> 01:04:46,277
[SPEAKER_25]: That's been asked several times for since KP laws come on board for a list of their billing and since they were 2020.

745
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:58,353
[SPEAKER_25]: 2020, we've asked for a list of all settlements that have been paid out in bills from KP Law since day one.

746
01:04:58,413 --> 01:05:01,394
[SPEAKER_25]: The original agreement that we agreed to was $5,000 a month.

747
01:05:03,094 --> 01:05:05,815
[SPEAKER_25]: Up until today, I haven't seen a bill.

748
01:05:05,975 --> 01:05:07,415
[SPEAKER_25]: I think I've asked for it a couple of times.

749
01:05:07,475 --> 01:05:09,615
[SPEAKER_25]: I know other Councilors have asked for it.

750
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:11,516
[SPEAKER_25]: How much money have we spent with KP Law?

751
01:05:11,896 --> 01:05:12,656
[SPEAKER_25]: We haven't gotten it yet.

752
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:16,255
[SPEAKER_15]: and then we'll go to you guys.

753
01:05:16,315 --> 01:05:17,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

754
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a couple things to add on KP law.

755
01:05:20,558 --> 01:05:27,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, we've been requesting documentation on it for two years.

756
01:05:27,184 --> 01:05:41,736
[SPEAKER_06]: The only documentation I saw was a completely blacked out invoice that was attempted to be used for backup for federal grants and can't possibly be, you know, it's determined by regulations can't possibly be used as backup for federal grants because it doesn't

757
01:05:42,412 --> 01:05:45,263
[SPEAKER_06]: include any identifying information as to what the money has been spent on.

758
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:48,354
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one thing that the only thing that I've seen out of KP law.

759
01:05:49,237 --> 01:05:54,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll say another thing about KP Law, the minute that we voted to cut that budget was the minute that all hell broke loose.

760
01:05:54,301 --> 01:05:56,262
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll just leave that at that.

761
01:05:57,043 --> 01:05:59,805
[SPEAKER_06]: When it comes to the funding piece, Mr. Jones, I appreciate you bringing it up.

762
01:06:00,506 --> 01:06:02,868
[SPEAKER_06]: I do have a couple of things on the agenda tonight.

763
01:06:03,568 --> 01:06:08,572
[SPEAKER_06]: One is to request that the administration provide an update on all pilot agreements and the status of negotiations on those.

764
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:12,555
[SPEAKER_06]: So Tufts University, Harvard Vanguard, Rivers Edge.

765
01:06:13,296 --> 01:06:17,159
[SPEAKER_06]: And something I've been talking about for a long time and I think it's about time to get going on is

766
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:30,055
[SPEAKER_06]: budget needs assessment ordinance so that we can actually have a budget process where we are determining what our needs are, what our existing revenues are the gap and then talk about the plan to meet that need, because I think

767
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:34,311
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't keep using lack of funding as an excuse.

768
01:06:34,891 --> 01:06:38,533
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to have a plan to bring in the funding we need to meet the needs of the community.

769
01:06:38,673 --> 01:06:40,714
[SPEAKER_06]: So I do have some stuff on the agenda tonight.

770
01:06:40,894 --> 01:06:43,695
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to working with my Councilor, fellow Councilors on that.

771
01:06:43,715 --> 01:06:49,938
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, when it comes to KPL, all I know is the only documentation we've received has been all blacked out.

772
01:06:53,135 --> 01:07:10,623
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do find it curious, Madam President, when we take a look at this agenda this evening, papers from the administration, and we'll see that they're trying to upgrade a position in the Community Development Department, but we have created a new position, upgrading the existing position from the land use planner to a senior planner.

773
01:07:12,164 --> 01:07:16,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Non-union role, we've seen more and more requests for non-union positions to get pay raises.

774
01:07:17,586 --> 01:07:18,787
[SPEAKER_08]: More and more requests for non-union.

775
01:07:19,572 --> 01:07:21,092
[SPEAKER_08]: positions to be reclassified.

776
01:07:21,553 --> 01:07:30,095
[SPEAKER_08]: We still have the issue of our human resource director working out of grade now for the better part of two and a half years and not being required to pay back any money.

777
01:07:32,416 --> 01:07:34,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Not being paid back any money to the taxpayers.

778
01:07:34,777 --> 01:07:37,457
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a human resource director who's being paid out of grade.

779
01:07:38,178 --> 01:07:42,979
[SPEAKER_08]: This council voted down, voted down the reclassification of the position.

780
01:07:43,879 --> 01:07:49,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Gentleman's still being paid between $69,000, I think more than what his initial salary was as diversity director.

781
01:07:50,714 --> 01:07:57,542
[SPEAKER_08]: And here we are with teachers educators in this community, fighting for a pittance 2%.

782
01:07:58,483 --> 01:08:00,105
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's that 35 bucks a week.

783
01:08:01,727 --> 01:08:07,193
[SPEAKER_18]: So, it's a little more than last night at the school committee meeting that was.

784
01:08:07,685 --> 01:08:08,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Just name and address for the record.

785
01:08:08,945 --> 01:08:13,947
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, Charlene Douglas phone for high street method mass president of the teacher association.

786
01:08:14,427 --> 01:08:17,008
[SPEAKER_18]: So last night at the school committee meeting.

787
01:08:17,909 --> 01:08:30,673
[SPEAKER_18]: It was clearly pointed out and as it should be it that the city, the school side administration, they have offered us a 7.25% increase over three years, 2.75 2.25 and two, I mean 2.5

788
01:08:38,168 --> 01:08:38,269
[SPEAKER_18]: 2.25 and 2.5.

789
01:08:39,150 --> 01:08:41,733
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that's the exact numbers.

790
01:08:42,193 --> 01:08:56,050
[SPEAKER_18]: They also are giving us a one time bonus of $1,000 that each year that does not apply to the base of our salaries, so it doesn't really benefit, you know, our teachers that

791
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:57,772
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, moving forward.

792
01:08:58,793 --> 01:09:12,392
[SPEAKER_18]: And while we appreciate that and you know, obviously we understand that we have a difference of opinion on how so funds can be used and we've shared the commissioners educations statement on that we've talked about chapter 170.

793
01:09:13,326 --> 01:09:16,067
[SPEAKER_18]: funding which Mr. Murphy spoke about to last night.

794
01:09:16,467 --> 01:09:17,908
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've, we've done all of that.

795
01:09:18,468 --> 01:09:25,891
[SPEAKER_18]: And so we have a difference of opinion, our proposal right now on the table is for 10% over three years.

796
01:09:26,651 --> 01:09:26,971
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

797
01:09:27,412 --> 01:09:38,716
[SPEAKER_18]: And in the open letter to the city to from the school department and the letter that was posted, it said that with the $1,000, it comes out to a 9.2.

798
01:09:42,068 --> 01:09:55,639
[SPEAKER_18]: percentage increase over three years but not really, because you can't count those thousand dollar bonuses in your percentage it doesn't impact, moving forward, you know what you're going to do and it doesn't even count towards your retirement.

799
01:09:56,099 --> 01:09:58,181
[SPEAKER_18]: So for example, I can't get a bonus.

800
01:09:58,942 --> 01:09:59,983
[SPEAKER_18]: And because that doesn't count.

801
01:10:00,323 --> 01:10:03,065
[SPEAKER_18]: If it isn't our contract, it does not count.

802
01:10:03,525 --> 01:10:05,307
[SPEAKER_18]: So I could do work outside

803
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:07,831
[SPEAKER_18]: and it's not there, it doesn't count.

804
01:10:07,891 --> 01:10:10,152
[SPEAKER_18]: And that happens to many of us, okay?

805
01:10:10,512 --> 01:10:13,833
[SPEAKER_18]: But I wanted to, the reason I came up is I wanted to state two things.

806
01:10:14,874 --> 01:10:30,061
[SPEAKER_18]: Number one is that last night we learned that there are three tentative agreements on the school side between the Carpenters and the, I believe it's four members, the Carpenters and Maintenance, sorry?

807
01:10:31,341 --> 01:10:33,302
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I know, the Carpenters and Maintenance, so there's four.

808
01:10:33,705 --> 01:10:37,827
[SPEAKER_18]: the nurses and the administrative assistants which are the secretaries on the school side.

809
01:10:38,107 --> 01:10:51,053
[SPEAKER_18]: So we've heard that there were three tentative agreements with a two to two for each one of those in regarding the, the mediation, and that we're at an impasse.

810
01:10:51,673 --> 01:10:56,535
[SPEAKER_18]: Today, we filed an objection to the petition for mediation.

811
01:10:57,525 --> 01:10:59,447
[SPEAKER_18]: The method teachers, we filed that.

812
01:10:59,768 --> 01:11:10,818
[SPEAKER_18]: We do not believe we are in pass, and we were very, very surprised to learn, and we learned it on Thursday at our negotiations.

813
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:20,468
[SPEAKER_18]: We learned that they were going to go to impasse, and then they posted that letter on their school webpage, okay?

814
01:11:20,995 --> 01:11:27,937
[SPEAKER_18]: And we did post today a response to that letter on our website and on our Facebook page.

815
01:11:29,098 --> 01:11:30,538
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's all I want to say.

816
01:11:30,558 --> 01:11:33,979
[SPEAKER_18]: And just to let you know, so we're willing to go back to that.

817
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:38,081
[SPEAKER_18]: We want to be at the table and we never said we never, we have never stated.

818
01:11:38,101 --> 01:11:50,705
[SPEAKER_18]: Matter of fact, last night, one of the members of the negotiating team felt totally disrespected and stated very clearly that we do want to be at the table and we have made progress at that table on some issues.

819
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:56,637
[SPEAKER_18]: and they're up and it's in the petition impasse filed by the city.

820
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:59,599
[SPEAKER_18]: It was more than just compensation that they cited.

821
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:01,960
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so thank you.

822
01:12:02,601 --> 01:12:02,921
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

823
01:12:03,461 --> 01:12:14,689
[SPEAKER_25]: Can we get a report on who's doing the negotiations with the city?

824
01:12:14,709 --> 01:12:17,470
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I don't know who's, is the mayor at the table?

825
01:12:18,211 --> 01:12:19,752
[SPEAKER_25]: Who's at the table doing these negotiations?

826
01:12:21,277 --> 01:12:22,498
[SPEAKER_18]: So on the school side.

827
01:12:24,099 --> 01:12:29,002
[SPEAKER_18]: The school side it's central administration that's at the table.

828
01:12:29,742 --> 01:12:34,906
[SPEAKER_18]: The mayor did attend one meeting on August 25.

829
01:12:35,846 --> 01:12:39,869
[SPEAKER_18]: So she did attend a meeting one negotiations meeting.

830
01:12:40,709 --> 01:12:41,970
[SPEAKER_18]: There was also.

831
01:12:43,983 --> 01:12:50,510
[SPEAKER_18]: So in our rebuttal, it says that not one elected school committee member is sat at our table.

832
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:56,556
[SPEAKER_18]: So we stand by that, that not one elected school committee member is at our table.

833
01:12:57,096 --> 01:12:59,439
[SPEAKER_18]: So the mayor is not elected to the school committee.

834
01:12:59,459 --> 01:12:59,899
[SPEAKER_25]: Who is at the table?

835
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:01,521
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. David Murphy.

836
01:13:02,221 --> 01:13:03,823
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, and he's representing the city?

837
01:13:04,283 --> 01:13:08,167
[SPEAKER_18]: He's part of the city so it's Mr. Murphy, the superintendent of schools, and they can choose.

838
01:13:08,187 --> 01:13:09,728
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm not saying they can't.

839
01:13:11,810 --> 01:13:15,473
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. Cushing, the assistant superintendent, Ms.

840
01:13:15,513 --> 01:13:19,136
[SPEAKER_18]: Galussi is also there.

841
01:13:20,898 --> 01:13:27,344
[SPEAKER_18]: Joan Bowen, the director of special needs, and Howard Greenspan is there for the attorney.

842
01:13:27,584 --> 01:13:28,765
[SPEAKER_18]: He is always at the meetings.

843
01:13:29,526 --> 01:13:31,167
[SPEAKER_18]: And what am I forgetting?

844
01:13:32,721 --> 01:13:34,623
[SPEAKER_18]: Superintendent is one more person.

845
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,764
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

846
01:13:36,925 --> 01:13:38,266
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry, I'm drawing a blank.

847
01:13:38,366 --> 01:13:41,748
[SPEAKER_25]: And who's negotiating for the city yet, on the city contracts?

848
01:13:42,649 --> 01:13:43,930
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I can only speak to the school.

849
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:44,311
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

850
01:13:45,006 --> 01:13:50,149
[SPEAKER_00]: On the city end, KP Law runs 100% of the negotiations.

851
01:13:50,609 --> 01:13:55,232
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a gentleman named Attorney Brian Mazur is doing everything.

852
01:13:55,612 --> 01:13:59,415
[SPEAKER_00]: They bring a guy in also to just sit there and say nothing for all the meetings.

853
01:13:59,795 --> 01:14:00,395
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's this guy?

854
01:14:00,555 --> 01:14:01,396
[SPEAKER_00]: His name's Neil.

855
01:14:01,496 --> 01:14:03,917
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the human resources director for the city.

856
01:14:04,358 --> 01:14:08,920
[SPEAKER_00]: He sits there with a mask on and does not say a word for any of the meetings.

857
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:09,140
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

858
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,422
[SPEAKER_15]: We can just keep to the facts, thank you.

859
01:14:11,622 --> 01:14:13,403
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the facts, thank you.

860
01:14:14,965 --> 01:14:17,466
[SPEAKER_26]: For our negotiations, we've had various chiefs of staff.

861
01:14:17,826 --> 01:14:22,668
[SPEAKER_26]: We've had multiple lawyers from KP Law, and one guy is at every meeting.

862
01:14:23,468 --> 01:14:26,589
[SPEAKER_26]: The HR director, Mr. Osborne, what's his title?

863
01:14:27,149 --> 01:14:27,989
[SPEAKER_26]: Not sure what that is.

864
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:29,010
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

865
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:30,190
[SPEAKER_26]: Thanks.

866
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:34,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Mercury, do you want to speak?

867
01:14:39,573 --> 01:14:41,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President, members of the council.

868
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:43,720
[SPEAKER_05]: pleasure to be with you.

869
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:45,181
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address the record, please.

870
01:14:45,521 --> 01:14:49,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, David Murphy, assistant superintendent, finance and operations for the Metropolitan Public Schools.

871
01:14:49,743 --> 01:15:00,268
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Miss Douglas is correct with respect to, uh, are the representatives of the school community negotiating team, as as is the case with the vast majority of school districts in the Commonwealth.

872
01:15:00,908 --> 01:15:05,570
[SPEAKER_05]: The school committee delegates that negotiating authority to the senior leadership.

873
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:09,512
[SPEAKER_05]: So the superintendent myself, other members of the executive leadership team, along with

874
01:15:10,032 --> 01:15:26,941
[SPEAKER_05]: our longtime school district council, Mr. Greenspan, who I know some of you have worked closely with over the years, have been in attendance over the course of the 10 months, the 17 bargaining sessions, as well as, frankly, several other meetings in which the parties have exchanged proposals and discussed the implications of those proposals.

875
01:15:28,962 --> 01:15:33,124
[SPEAKER_05]: The vice chair, Graham, and the mayor have also attended meetings

876
01:15:33,944 --> 01:15:40,206
[SPEAKER_05]: as part of an attempt to resolve this, which was discussed at length during last night's school committee meeting.

877
01:15:40,947 --> 01:15:55,632
[SPEAKER_05]: The only comment I would add beyond responding to Mr. Carballo's question is that the committee made the decision to declare an impasse and file for a petition for mediation with the Department of Labor Relations reluctantly.

878
01:15:56,345 --> 01:16:02,448
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, we don't see it as something that should delay the resolution of this.

879
01:16:02,568 --> 01:16:10,651
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, it's our hope that it will, it will accelerate that conversation and get to a resolution as quickly as possible.

880
01:16:12,732 --> 01:16:14,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't understand the message that you're trying to send.

881
01:16:14,533 --> 01:16:20,095
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have a group of 500 teachers that you're negotiating with and you're going to the labor board and you're saying,

882
01:16:20,595 --> 01:16:26,480
[SPEAKER_08]: We reached an impasse which really means we don't want to negotiate anymore we're walking from the table but then at the same breath is saying we do want to negotiate.

883
01:16:27,221 --> 01:16:29,623
[SPEAKER_05]: I just I totally disagree with that characterization.

884
01:16:30,004 --> 01:16:39,933
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to seek support from a mediator to try to break the logjam, so that we can get a competitive and sustainable wage increase to our teachers, we think that's what they deserve and that's why we've done that.

885
01:16:40,493 --> 01:16:42,415
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, so now we're in a situation where we have

886
01:16:42,795 --> 01:17:08,045
[SPEAKER_08]: other bargaining units that are receiving a cost of living adjustment right which is really just a cost of living adjustment to combat inflation at the battle inflation right so now we have units that have settled contracts at two percent and now we're giving cost of living adjustments at a different rate to other employees so it kind of sends a message of value the work of some more than others and that the impact on the economic factors that are happening around all of us um

887
01:17:09,775 --> 01:17:17,239
[SPEAKER_08]: don't impact those traffic supervisors, for example, or those school nurses in the same fashion that they would impact the school teacher.

888
01:17:17,819 --> 01:17:18,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

889
01:17:18,199 --> 01:17:19,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just respond quickly?

890
01:17:20,401 --> 01:17:25,123
[SPEAKER_05]: One, I'd be hesitant to characterize the specific of tentative agreements that haven't been made public.

891
01:17:26,084 --> 01:17:28,805
[SPEAKER_05]: The second thing I would say is that we do not value

892
01:17:33,209 --> 01:17:36,211
[SPEAKER_05]: differently the hard work and dedication of our employees.

893
01:17:37,072 --> 01:17:45,298
[SPEAKER_05]: That said, the economic impact of a unit with three employees versus a unit with 500 employees is different.

894
01:17:45,638 --> 01:17:58,787
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that's why it's important that each negotiation be looked at on a case by case basis so that we can treat each unit and group of employees fairly and at the same time do right by the community and our representation of them.

895
01:17:59,272 --> 01:18:01,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what the school district has done.

896
01:18:01,414 --> 01:18:08,219
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're proud that we've been able to reach resolution with three of these groups over the course of the last week.

897
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:13,423
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I said, we hope to reach resolution with all units, including the teachers, as quickly as possible.

898
01:18:15,184 --> 01:18:15,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

899
01:18:15,805 --> 01:18:16,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Bears.

900
01:18:17,546 --> 01:18:18,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

901
01:18:18,507 --> 01:18:19,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Just two questions.

902
01:18:19,968 --> 01:18:21,129
[SPEAKER_06]: One's for clarity purposes.

903
01:18:23,120 --> 01:18:30,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Even though an impasse has been declared, I just want to make sure I hear what you're saying, that doesn't preclude, would you negotiate while you're waiting for a mediator to be assigned?

904
01:18:30,465 --> 01:18:33,767
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't anticipate waiting an extended period of time for the mediator.

905
01:18:34,107 --> 01:18:38,670
[SPEAKER_05]: If there was some type of pronounced delay for some reason, that's certainly something that we would consider.

906
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:47,115
[SPEAKER_05]: But our point and the school committee's point in filing this is that there have been a number of exchanges within the discourse

907
01:18:47,575 --> 01:18:49,976
[SPEAKER_05]: and reflecting upon the proposals that have been exchanged.

908
01:18:50,336 --> 01:18:58,040
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't believe the parties are going to be able to make progress until some variable changes, and that's why we're looking for the mediators' support in that.

909
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:03,282
[SPEAKER_05]: But if a session was requested, would you have a session is all I'm really asking.

910
01:19:04,262 --> 01:19:06,783
[SPEAKER_05]: where the petition was just filed on Thursday.

911
01:19:06,863 --> 01:19:09,763
[SPEAKER_05]: So our position is we're going to wait to hear from the state.

912
01:19:09,863 --> 01:19:13,284
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's our, as I said, we think the timeline is going to be very consistent.

913
01:19:13,304 --> 01:19:25,606
[SPEAKER_05]: But as I said to the school committee last night, who asked a very reasonable question as to what is my expectation with regard to a timeline, given that I'm only representing one party, I can't frankly speak to that with any greater specificity than I could without the mediator.

914
01:19:25,906 --> 01:19:30,647
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is our hope that this will accelerate that process because we want a resolution as quickly as possible.

915
01:19:31,288 --> 01:19:31,908
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thanks.

916
01:19:32,048 --> 01:19:32,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And the second question,

917
01:19:34,393 --> 01:19:45,223
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I've been following, I've been listening, we've been talking about this, we had a budget hearing, this came up then, we've had a lot of meetings about this, and you've had a lot of meetings about this, and everyone's had a lot of meetings about this, I think that's the one thing we maybe can all agree on.

918
01:19:48,005 --> 01:20:00,996
[SPEAKER_06]: When you are talking about sustainability of the contract, and that's your characterization of it, what financial information are you being given by the city of Medford

919
01:20:01,953 --> 01:20:03,554
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're making your determinations on?

920
01:20:03,594 --> 01:20:07,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you being told what to expect next year from the budget?

921
01:20:07,115 --> 01:20:08,675
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have figures that are coming to you?

922
01:20:08,695 --> 01:20:17,439
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the real issue here, we're talking a lot about the different positions, we're talking a lot about the different offers, talking about 2%, 3% offers.

923
01:20:17,899 --> 01:20:29,043
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of the day, this is gonna come down to dollars, and the dollars in the budget, and what the school committee requests, and what is allocated by the mayor, and then what we try to move forward on.

924
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,542
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're not talking about any of this in dollar terms.

925
01:20:32,622 --> 01:20:36,746
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like actually having the answer, you know, what's the real, what's the real gap?

926
01:20:36,766 --> 01:20:41,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you being told, this is your allocation next year, this is what you can expect to get from the city.

927
01:20:42,412 --> 01:20:44,894
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the limit on your contract negotiation?

928
01:20:45,035 --> 01:20:47,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Or do you do we not even have the information?

929
01:20:47,277 --> 01:20:48,418
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going off of estimates?

930
01:20:48,458 --> 01:20:49,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we going off projections?

931
01:20:49,819 --> 01:20:52,162
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, what information do you have?

932
01:20:52,602 --> 01:20:56,024
[SPEAKER_06]: that you're using to make the decisions to outline your bargaining position?

933
01:20:56,044 --> 01:20:58,865
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, that's a that's a totally fair question, Councilor Bears.

934
01:21:00,066 --> 01:21:05,249
[SPEAKER_05]: What I would say is number one, we don't have a secret data sheet that tells us exactly what the budget is going to be in the years ahead.

935
01:21:06,149 --> 01:21:07,350
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that's not the case.

936
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:19,917
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we do have is an understanding as to what the budgetary capacities for the city and what the trajectory of that is given the limitations on the tax levy that I know all of you are familiar with.

937
01:21:20,037 --> 01:21:21,618
[SPEAKER_05]: So our

938
01:21:23,271 --> 01:21:32,834
[SPEAKER_05]: projections are based on that anticipated growth over a period of time and what the existing capacity is and what it will likely be in the years ahead.

939
01:21:32,874 --> 01:21:42,776
[SPEAKER_05]: There are, as I said last night, variables that could change, some of which that are beyond the scope of the municipality, certainly with respect to chapter 70 funding.

940
01:21:43,256 --> 01:21:48,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And in some of the information that the union has shared, the sort of position, which again, I'm not,

941
01:21:49,898 --> 01:21:53,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not opining about this, I'm just saying that I'm relaying the information that Ms.

942
01:21:53,380 --> 01:22:15,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Douglas and her team have shared publicly, is that if we were to commit to a financial, an agreement beyond our current financial capacity, and that variable were to change based on increased investment in Chapter 70, which is, I'm assuming I'm in front of the school committee, so excuse me, Chapter 70 being the state's education allocation.

943
01:22:15,872 --> 01:22:18,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Which we send mostly to charter schools anyway, but continue.

944
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:20,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Very few of us agree with the formula.

945
01:22:20,984 --> 01:22:22,485
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's probably true.

946
01:22:22,505 --> 01:22:24,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the union would agree with that as well.

947
01:22:24,325 --> 01:22:32,469
[SPEAKER_05]: But if that number were to increase, then potentially that capacity could be greater and we could potentially commit more resources.

948
01:22:32,529 --> 01:22:34,490
[SPEAKER_05]: However, there's two issues.

949
01:22:34,710 --> 01:22:37,471
[SPEAKER_05]: One, the needs of our students are increasing as well.

950
01:22:38,151 --> 01:22:39,772
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we have to

951
01:22:40,352 --> 01:22:45,796
[SPEAKER_05]: consider all of our financial obligations in the context of increasingly expensive needs on the part of kids.

952
01:22:46,277 --> 01:22:53,803
[SPEAKER_05]: The second thing that we have to take into account is that that that increases uncertain because it's based on state revenues on a year over year basis.

953
01:22:54,183 --> 01:23:05,432
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it would be in our view irresponsible to commit to a financial agreement that is beyond the scope of our current capacity in the hope that some variable changes and there is there's more money available.

954
01:23:05,552 --> 01:23:06,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, um,

955
01:23:07,533 --> 01:23:23,877
[SPEAKER_05]: In the event that scope changes I think the school committee as the bargaining agent might be in a different position but right now we are not and we think our responsibility committee feels it's responsibility is to operate within the capacity that we do have and make a responsible deal.

956
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:29,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Last thing I'll say and probably I know this is a lengthy answer, my final point, the seven and a quarter percent over three years

957
01:23:30,518 --> 01:23:37,941
[SPEAKER_05]: that we've offered in addition to the one-time $1,000 payments made possible through the grants, which, as Ms.

958
01:23:37,961 --> 01:23:51,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Douglas correctly points out, would not be incorporated into that base pay, is a significantly more competitive offer than has been the outcome of the previous three collective bargaining agreements over the course of the past 10 years.

959
01:23:51,448 --> 01:23:52,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the context has changed.

960
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:54,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Inflation is a real thing.

961
01:23:54,749 --> 01:23:56,130
[SPEAKER_05]: The burdens of

962
01:23:56,663 --> 01:23:59,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Educating students coming out of a pandemic are real things.

963
01:23:59,145 --> 01:24:01,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So we should be offering a more competitive deal.

964
01:24:01,987 --> 01:24:04,569
[SPEAKER_05]: But as I said last night, we are.

965
01:24:05,069 --> 01:24:19,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the suggestion that somehow we are intentionally offering a deal that is meant to be disrespectful, I think is just not an accurate characterization of where these negotiations are.

966
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,221
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the answer.

967
01:24:22,675 --> 01:24:36,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that there's variables in the situation, but if you're making, let's say this, you have your projections, you're making your decisions based on your assumption that those projections are the best possible projection you can make at this time.

968
01:24:36,523 --> 01:24:38,944
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you talked about variables that could increase revenue.

969
01:24:39,304 --> 01:24:42,406
[SPEAKER_06]: You left out one key variable that could increase revenue.

970
01:24:42,846 --> 01:24:51,171
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is that the mayor submits a budget and the mayor could commit to submit a budget with the revenue necessary to fund something.

971
01:24:51,791 --> 01:24:54,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I understand it's a difficult position that you're in here.

972
01:24:54,913 --> 01:25:02,357
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, this is a large city budget, things get reallocated there's a free cash you know we're going to certify free cash in September.

973
01:25:02,737 --> 01:25:13,283
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to put the point out there that at the end of the day this comes down to dollars and cents, and there's only one person empowered by the city charter to make a commitment to use city funds to fund something like this, and it hasn't happened.

974
01:25:13,463 --> 01:25:16,445
[SPEAKER_06]: So, when we talk about what

975
01:25:17,313 --> 01:25:29,915
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think Secretary Rousseau mentioned last night that we are living in a system that's designed to have us at each other's throats because we have this false notion of scarcity that's being imposed on us by the state laws and regulatory systems we're under.

976
01:25:30,395 --> 01:25:31,676
[SPEAKER_06]: We also do have choices.

977
01:25:32,456 --> 01:25:43,678
[SPEAKER_06]: And I understand you're not in, you know, you're in the position that you're in, but whether we're talking about the needs of the students or the needs to fund the contract,

978
01:25:44,698 --> 01:25:54,003
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a someone who could make a commitment as part of this process to make sure that the money is there and it seems that that hasn't happened and I just want to make that point very clear that that's how the laws of the city work.

979
01:25:54,664 --> 01:25:57,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, we talked about sustainability.

980
01:25:59,327 --> 01:26:01,468
[SPEAKER_06]: We are setting the conditions of what sustainable means.

981
01:26:02,615 --> 01:26:16,305
[SPEAKER_06]: And the person at the top of the leadership of the city is setting the conditions of what sustainable means, and clearly, there's a vast disagreement that, or at least a general consensus that those conditions are unsatisfactory.

982
01:26:16,446 --> 01:26:20,028
[SPEAKER_06]: So I understand that you're in the position you're in you're not the person who makes that choice.

983
01:26:20,549 --> 01:26:24,492
[SPEAKER_06]: But when we talk about the variables we can talk all we want about hoping the state's going to come in and save us they're not.

984
01:26:25,823 --> 01:26:29,225
[SPEAKER_06]: The chapter 70 formula doesn't benefit this city because our property values are too high.

985
01:26:29,725 --> 01:26:45,554
[SPEAKER_05]: So just respectfully, that's the point that the district has been making to the union for some time, that assuming the chapter 70 increase is going to somehow skyrocket so that we can afford the 18% over three year proposal that the union initially made is not accurate.

986
01:26:46,075 --> 01:26:48,516
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't count on it, it would be irresponsible for us to do it.

987
01:26:48,796 --> 01:26:51,718
[SPEAKER_05]: So I will say again, this is really my final point, I hope,

988
01:26:53,025 --> 01:26:55,166
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no intention of disrespecting our teachers.

989
01:26:55,646 --> 01:27:00,167
[SPEAKER_05]: We understand that they have carried this district and this community on their back through the pandemic.

990
01:27:00,567 --> 01:27:12,890
[SPEAKER_05]: We know how dependent we are on them, but the only way we're going to be able to employ them in the numbers we need to, to provide all the services and support to students that they need, is to have a competitive but sustainable wage increase.

991
01:27:13,230 --> 01:27:15,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And therefore we have to operate within our capacity.

992
01:27:15,671 --> 01:27:17,491
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the point that we have been making, Mr. Bears.

993
01:27:17,551 --> 01:27:18,311
[SPEAKER_05]: For 17 months.

994
01:27:21,712 --> 01:27:30,201
[SPEAKER_15]: I do want to, I would like I would entertain a motion at this point for me to go, which is fine.

995
01:27:30,421 --> 01:27:32,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

996
01:27:32,924 --> 01:27:34,766
[SPEAKER_15]: patiently for items on the agenda.

997
01:27:34,906 --> 01:27:36,047
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can keep it brief.

998
01:27:36,628 --> 01:27:42,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Just one sentence, the person who sets the capacity that we're talking about that determines sustainability is the mayor of the city of Medford, period.

999
01:27:51,677 --> 01:27:54,740
[SPEAKER_15]: and then I would love a motion to reverse the regular business.

1000
01:27:54,820 --> 01:28:00,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, we sit here and talk about craziest stuff for all night long about stuff that doesn't even matter.

1001
01:28:00,144 --> 01:28:04,247
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that's very important to the lives of at least 500 people that reside in this community.

1002
01:28:04,407 --> 01:28:06,589
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have been speaking about it for 90 minutes.

1003
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:08,350
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay, but it is what it is, right?

1004
01:28:08,410 --> 01:28:10,432
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we got to do with this, what we're here for, right?

1005
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:11,432
[SPEAKER_07]: We voted to go bi-weekly.

1006
01:28:11,452 --> 01:28:14,054
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to have to deal with some long meetings sometimes.

1007
01:28:14,194 --> 01:28:15,555
[SPEAKER_15]: And I am happy to revisit it.

1008
01:28:16,316 --> 01:28:17,377
[SPEAKER_15]: You have something brief right now.

1009
01:28:17,577 --> 01:28:19,078
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm happy to revisit it.

1010
01:28:19,158 --> 01:28:20,759
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to get to the city staff.

1011
01:28:20,839 --> 01:28:22,260
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to revisit it.

1012
01:28:22,280 --> 01:28:22,761
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

1013
01:28:22,861 --> 01:28:23,221
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

1014
01:28:23,241 --> 01:28:24,061
[SPEAKER_08]: We suspended the rules.

1015
01:28:24,081 --> 01:28:24,642
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have to.

1016
01:28:24,722 --> 01:28:25,523
[SPEAKER_08]: We voted for it.

1017
01:28:25,563 --> 01:28:26,663
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the situation we're in.

1018
01:28:27,884 --> 01:28:37,151
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when listening to what Mr. Murphy said about the most recent package being better than the last three collective bargaining agreements, I've been around a long time.

1019
01:28:37,811 --> 01:28:38,952
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

1020
01:28:39,512 --> 01:28:44,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe the employees took less back then, but we didn't hear him complain because they felt a lot more appreciated.

1021
01:28:44,977 --> 01:28:53,725
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that that's really a reoccurring theme that I'm feeling and that I'm hearing across many departments here in the city, but the school department's not exempt.

1022
01:28:54,046 --> 01:29:01,833
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we sit here and we talk about the filing for an impasse as a way for us to move closer to a settlement, it's not.

1023
01:29:02,373 --> 01:29:03,194
[SPEAKER_08]: In my opinion, it's not.

1024
01:29:03,274 --> 01:29:09,640
[SPEAKER_08]: It sounds more to me like the administration just trying to control the narrative and the public perception as to what's going on than

1025
01:29:10,861 --> 01:29:27,195
[SPEAKER_08]: actual progress towards a settlement and really sounds just like a counter to the June budget job action that was taken and the job actions that are being taken now because the union's being publicly vocal about their position and the way that they feel to be treated.

1026
01:29:27,735 --> 01:29:33,139
[SPEAKER_08]: With that being said, Madam President, it sounds to me like you want to move on, so I'd be happy to rest my case.

1027
01:29:33,559 --> 01:29:35,200
[SPEAKER_15]: I am more than happy to return to it.

1028
01:29:35,380 --> 01:29:37,601
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a number of city staff who have been waiting patiently.

1029
01:29:37,902 --> 01:29:39,543
[SPEAKER_15]: This is absolutely an important topic.

1030
01:29:39,623 --> 01:29:41,444
[SPEAKER_15]: I also want to get to the staff who are on the agenda.

1031
01:29:41,484 --> 01:29:46,947
[SPEAKER_08]: It's important to point out that the city staff is being paid to be here, and these people are here on their own, free will and volition as well.

1032
01:29:46,967 --> 01:29:48,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want that to be clear.

1033
01:29:48,208 --> 01:29:51,550
[SPEAKER_15]: And I chair the meeting, so do I have a motion?

1034
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:53,151
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we want to stay in public participation?

1035
01:29:53,311 --> 01:29:53,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion.

1036
01:29:55,403 --> 01:29:57,124
[SPEAKER_23]: Motion to suspend the rules and take 22500 and 22502.

1037
01:29:57,204 --> 01:30:03,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to take 22, the rules are suspended, so I'd like to take 2250.

1038
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:07,186
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam, can I request an amendment?

1039
01:30:07,206 --> 01:30:10,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we take paper 22-504?

1040
01:30:10,667 --> 01:30:18,649
[SPEAKER_23]: Sure, I just know that my director, Director Hunt can't stay too long, so I wanted to make sure that we got to her.

1041
01:30:18,929 --> 01:30:21,050
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine, we can take it later, I just, the people here.

1042
01:30:27,443 --> 01:30:31,193
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm more than happy to keep in public participation if people want to vote to keep them in public participation.

1043
01:30:31,273 --> 01:30:35,204
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm trying to give fair time to people who are also speaking on the agenda.

1044
01:30:36,973 --> 01:30:39,174
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, as chair, that's my purpose.

1045
01:30:39,194 --> 01:30:41,016
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Collins, sorry.

1046
01:30:42,036 --> 01:30:43,317
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Collins, do you wanna take 22-500?

1047
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:43,537
[SPEAKER_15]: 500, 502, and 504.

1048
01:30:43,577 --> 01:30:48,961
[SPEAKER_23]: All right, so on the motion of Councilor Collins to take 22-500, 22-502, and 22-503, correct?

1049
01:30:48,981 --> 01:30:49,441
[SPEAKER_15]: 504 was the last one.

1050
01:30:49,461 --> 01:30:49,681
[SPEAKER_15]: 504, okay.

1051
01:30:49,701 --> 01:30:50,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Second by... Second.

1052
01:30:50,602 --> 01:30:52,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Paris, all those in favor?

1053
01:31:07,007 --> 01:31:14,090
[SPEAKER_15]: I was opposed passes to two dash five zero zero offered by Councilor Collins.

1054
01:31:15,091 --> 01:31:28,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Here's all the the Medford City Council receive an update on the solid waste task force the forthcoming request for proposals from waste haulers as well as an upcoming opportunities for residents to learn more about the waste disposal contract negotiation and give feedback Councilor Collins.

1055
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:30,291
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Morell.

1056
01:31:30,591 --> 01:31:34,074
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been enjoying serving on the Solid Waste Task Force so far this season.

1057
01:31:35,114 --> 01:31:52,367
[SPEAKER_23]: We have some exciting opportunities for resident and business feedback on the work that we're doing, and Director Hunt is here tonight to share more information that my fellow Councilors and residents should know about the work ahead on re-evaluating the solid waste hauling contract.

1058
01:31:52,467 --> 01:31:52,727
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1059
01:31:55,237 --> 01:31:55,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Holmes.

1060
01:31:55,857 --> 01:31:59,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any councilors would like to speak on this before we see a presentation from director?

1061
01:31:59,239 --> 01:32:02,161
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you need me to?

1062
01:32:03,161 --> 01:32:04,682
[SPEAKER_19]: I raised my hand on the zoom.

1063
01:32:04,742 --> 01:32:05,902
[SPEAKER_19]: It's the one that's raised.

1064
01:32:06,063 --> 01:32:11,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's and then I can I have just a very few just to serve slides.

1065
01:32:11,065 --> 01:32:11,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think so.

1066
01:32:12,206 --> 01:32:16,888
[SPEAKER_15]: If Shane, if you could make the planning development with the hand raised a co host so that they can share.

1067
01:32:24,656 --> 01:32:32,400
[SPEAKER_19]: So I will be very brief, but we have information we'd like to update the council on, and that we would like for the public to be aware of.

1068
01:32:33,980 --> 01:32:37,982
[SPEAKER_19]: So I thank you, Councilor Collins, for bringing this up.

1069
01:32:38,022 --> 01:32:39,963
[SPEAKER_19]: And I appreciate taking me out of order.

1070
01:32:39,983 --> 01:32:44,946
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here this evening, I have actually injured my back, so I can't actually sit while I'm waiting.

1071
01:32:45,486 --> 01:32:47,907
[SPEAKER_19]: So I appreciate not having to be here all evening.

1072
01:32:58,108 --> 01:33:04,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Or change.

1073
01:33:05,333 --> 01:33:08,915
[SPEAKER_15]: So you should be able to share now.

1074
01:33:19,361 --> 01:33:20,762
[SPEAKER_13]: Share this.

1075
01:33:20,822 --> 01:33:21,163
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1076
01:33:28,252 --> 01:33:29,413
[SPEAKER_19]: There we go.

1077
01:33:29,573 --> 01:33:31,674
[SPEAKER_19]: So I did want to share with the city council.

1078
01:33:32,675 --> 01:33:34,336
[SPEAKER_19]: We do have a solid waste task force.

1079
01:33:34,416 --> 01:33:36,438
[SPEAKER_19]: It was advertised to the public.

1080
01:33:36,478 --> 01:33:37,839
[SPEAKER_19]: We asked for volunteers.

1081
01:33:39,340 --> 01:33:46,005
[SPEAKER_19]: This task force is being co-chaired by myself and Tim McGivern, the Commissioner of Public Works, who is on the call as well.

1082
01:33:46,705 --> 01:33:52,469
[SPEAKER_19]: We are being very wonderfully supported by a graduate student, Madeline Levine.

1083
01:33:52,589 --> 01:33:57,673
[SPEAKER_19]: Actually, her summer work was supported by a fellowship from Harvard, and now we are paying her

1084
01:33:57,973 --> 01:33:59,654
[SPEAKER_19]: with city funds this fall.

1085
01:34:00,395 --> 01:34:02,956
[SPEAKER_19]: And I list before you the members of the task force.

1086
01:34:05,077 --> 01:34:11,061
[SPEAKER_19]: We just wanted people to be aware that our current hauler is waste management and that contract's ending soon.

1087
01:34:11,501 --> 01:34:17,505
[SPEAKER_19]: We really, this is the right time to understand our waste services, what needs to change.

1088
01:34:17,825 --> 01:34:19,446
[SPEAKER_19]: Basically, the world has changed.

1089
01:34:20,007 --> 01:34:23,529
[SPEAKER_19]: Trash has changed, recycling has changed, and the residents have changed.

1090
01:34:23,912 --> 01:34:28,134
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we need to know what people would like to see in trash services.

1091
01:34:29,154 --> 01:34:31,515
[SPEAKER_19]: We are doing public outreach this fall.

1092
01:34:32,475 --> 01:34:38,538
[SPEAKER_19]: We have to do this relatively quickly, because it takes haulers a very long time to get up to speed.

1093
01:34:39,819 --> 01:34:52,289
[SPEAKER_19]: Any waste company that would take over this contract if it wasn't waste management would need to purchase trucks, and those take a very long time to purchase to procure and bring online, and they would need to hire staff.

1094
01:34:52,969 --> 01:34:56,012
[SPEAKER_19]: And then at the same time I want the council to know now.

1095
01:34:56,712 --> 01:35:01,314
[SPEAKER_19]: that the contract will need to be for a good number of years.

1096
01:35:01,374 --> 01:35:05,396
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not committing to that number at this point, but more than three.

1097
01:35:05,536 --> 01:35:11,159
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're gonna need city council approval because those trucks have to be amortized over the life of the contract.

1098
01:35:11,519 --> 01:35:20,343
[SPEAKER_19]: And the shorter your contract is, the higher the rates you pay because they're amortizing the cost of those trucks, which are their biggest, biggest expense.

1099
01:35:21,343 --> 01:35:25,925
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm expecting that number to be somewhere between seven and 10 years that we're gonna ask for a contract.

1100
01:35:26,366 --> 01:35:28,027
[SPEAKER_19]: and I wanted the council to know that now.

1101
01:35:28,667 --> 01:35:38,051
[SPEAKER_19]: Part of our plan is to, we have a survey now, we're gonna do public input now and then have some meetings in October and November and draft an RFP in the fall.

1102
01:35:38,491 --> 01:35:53,638
[SPEAKER_19]: Before we release the RFP to the waste haulers, we'd like to bring it in front of city council so that you all are comfortable with the RFP that we're putting out such that when we get the bids back and negotiate with the contractor,

1103
01:35:54,058 --> 01:35:59,482
[SPEAKER_19]: The council is ready to approve that contract, because you would have seen what it is it's in the RFP.

1104
01:36:00,703 --> 01:36:12,672
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not been aware of a process where the staff have brought an RFP to the council before we're bringing the actual contract the person who has bought it has wanted to negotiated contract.

1105
01:36:13,076 --> 01:36:25,527
[SPEAKER_19]: to the council, but we think this will really help smooth the process later when we're negotiating with the waste haulers, we wanna feel more comfortable that the council is gonna be comfortable with this contract.

1106
01:36:26,812 --> 01:36:35,139
[SPEAKER_19]: So what I really wanted to really be here tonight was to give you that information, as well as to make sure that everybody knows we wanna hear from everyone.

1107
01:36:35,679 --> 01:36:39,262
[SPEAKER_19]: Right now, we have a number of, we have a business survey that's out.

1108
01:36:39,602 --> 01:36:42,244
[SPEAKER_19]: We only have 16 business responses.

1109
01:36:42,605 --> 01:36:45,287
[SPEAKER_19]: We would really like to get more business responses.

1110
01:36:45,867 --> 01:36:47,789
[SPEAKER_19]: We also have a residential survey out.

1111
01:36:48,109 --> 01:36:51,552
[SPEAKER_19]: We have over 550 responses to our residential survey.

1112
01:36:52,023 --> 01:36:59,206
[SPEAKER_19]: The survey is also available in five languages, the five languages that you typically see things from the city of Medford in.

1113
01:36:59,706 --> 01:37:01,207
[SPEAKER_19]: So that survey is available.

1114
01:37:02,007 --> 01:37:06,969
[SPEAKER_19]: If people are watching on TV or on their computer right now, this is a QR code.

1115
01:37:07,209 --> 01:37:08,310
[SPEAKER_19]: You can take your phone.

1116
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:18,921
[SPEAKER_19]: You can open the camera on your phone and point it at that at the screen and your camera will pop up a little URL and you can click on it and go straight to the survey.

1117
01:37:19,362 --> 01:37:20,563
[SPEAKER_19]: So we want to make that available.

1118
01:37:20,883 --> 01:37:26,670
[SPEAKER_19]: There's also the URL there is bit.ly slash Medford waste.

1119
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:32,344
[SPEAKER_19]: We also are gonna have a number of in-person locations where you can do the survey.

1120
01:37:32,904 --> 01:37:37,048
[SPEAKER_19]: It's always available from our office in City Hall from now until October 1st.

1121
01:37:37,648 --> 01:37:43,053
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had and will continue to have people at the farmer's market the next three weeks from three to 5 p.m.

1122
01:37:43,773 --> 01:37:48,057
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had and will continue to have people at the public library on Saturday mornings.

1123
01:37:48,977 --> 01:37:55,683
[SPEAKER_19]: And I will be actually myself at the Mystic River Festival with the survey and other sustainability

1124
01:37:56,247 --> 01:38:00,530
[SPEAKER_19]: planning information on September 24th from 12 to four.

1125
01:38:01,311 --> 01:38:05,014
[SPEAKER_19]: And the other thing we want to convey to people is that our office has a newsletter.

1126
01:38:05,374 --> 01:38:07,716
[SPEAKER_19]: We have 1700 people subscribed already.

1127
01:38:07,776 --> 01:38:09,898
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd really like to add everybody.

1128
01:38:10,258 --> 01:38:14,321
[SPEAKER_19]: There are 58,000 people in the city of Medford, cut the children out.

1129
01:38:15,262 --> 01:38:15,422
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

1130
01:38:20,706 --> 01:38:25,230
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we're doing farmers markets, public library, no disrespect, but that's really,

1131
01:38:25,882 --> 01:38:27,963
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one demographic, if you really look at it.

1132
01:38:29,804 --> 01:38:34,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Have we looked at doing the PTOs at the high school, where we have hundreds of parents going through?

1133
01:38:34,926 --> 01:38:37,587
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we doing like the Mephiti football games?

1134
01:38:37,607 --> 01:38:39,207
[SPEAKER_03]: We have hundreds of parents going through.

1135
01:38:39,648 --> 01:38:40,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we looking at different events?

1136
01:38:40,868 --> 01:38:50,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I understand whenever we do these surveys, I don't know if it's as visible to everybody else, but we keep doing it at the same places.

1137
01:38:50,891 --> 01:38:53,654
[SPEAKER_03]: We keep doing these at the libraries, the farmers market.

1138
01:38:54,114 --> 01:38:58,439
[SPEAKER_03]: There are other people in the community that are represented, but we're not going to them at all.

1139
01:38:58,459 --> 01:39:09,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we should really take a hard look because this impacts our community, the whole community, not just this demographic, because it seems like that's all we're doing right here.

1140
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:26,395
[SPEAKER_03]: It's with tagging one part of the community we have to start looking at our when other communities do these outreach and I think it's very important this is this is a great step because we're seeing this is where I would like to see more public participation, more involvement but

1141
01:39:27,975 --> 01:39:45,768
[SPEAKER_03]: Why aren't we doing this more into the largest scheme scheme of it that the public schools when they're doing different meetings that, that, that, you know, the, the big athletic events in the city, you know, the, the, the big road race this weekend we're having hundreds of people this weekend.

1142
01:39:46,508 --> 01:39:51,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Why wouldn't we be doing things like that I mean the mystic rest of the river festival September.

1143
01:39:52,194 --> 01:39:57,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's the same people that go to library and say people that will see at the farmers market.

1144
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:02,204
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have broadened, you know, our outreach here.

1145
01:40:02,765 --> 01:40:05,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's look at Sunday we're gonna have hundreds of people running a city wide road race.

1146
01:40:06,729 --> 01:40:07,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Well let's look.

1147
01:40:07,790 --> 01:40:09,131
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to see that if we can.

1148
01:40:09,271 --> 01:40:09,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1149
01:40:10,055 --> 01:40:12,657
[SPEAKER_19]: So I appreciate the input, it is really helpful to us.

1150
01:40:13,117 --> 01:40:19,921
[SPEAKER_19]: We have, our committee has been suggesting locations and volunteering themselves to go out.

1151
01:40:20,801 --> 01:40:25,104
[SPEAKER_19]: Our staff are paid salaries, so they don't get paid overtime to go to all of these events.

1152
01:40:25,744 --> 01:40:27,505
[SPEAKER_19]: Madeline is the only one who's hourly.

1153
01:40:27,985 --> 01:40:34,149
[SPEAKER_19]: So we have been asking the committee to volunteer to be at some of these and to go to some of these events.

1154
01:40:35,069 --> 01:40:37,931
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm happy to hear these ideas and we have been circulating them

1155
01:40:38,391 --> 01:40:42,853
[SPEAKER_19]: via email and on the web, that's how we have 550 responses already.

1156
01:40:42,873 --> 01:40:45,234
[SPEAKER_19]: It has been circulating to some of these groups.

1157
01:40:45,534 --> 01:40:48,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a lot of residents in the city of Mexico, right?

1158
01:40:48,515 --> 01:40:49,356
[SPEAKER_03]: 500 is not a lot.

1159
01:40:49,596 --> 01:40:50,916
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a good number for some of us.

1160
01:40:50,976 --> 01:40:55,398
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't disagree, but I guarantee it's the 550 people that do all the surveys.

1161
01:40:55,798 --> 01:41:02,361
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to start reaching out to a greater scheme, a greater number, because this is a lot of money.

1162
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:07,063
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can see it, this is a big, people don't realize how huge

1163
01:41:07,723 --> 01:41:10,085
[SPEAKER_03]: this negotiation is exactly what it entails.

1164
01:41:10,265 --> 01:41:12,147
[SPEAKER_03]: So I appreciate it.

1165
01:41:12,227 --> 01:41:12,567
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1166
01:41:13,268 --> 01:41:14,369
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1167
01:41:17,272 --> 01:41:19,073
[SPEAKER_25]: When does this contract expire?

1168
01:41:20,134 --> 01:41:24,078
[SPEAKER_19]: The contract expires next summer, June 30.

1169
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:27,021
[SPEAKER_25]: 6 of 23?

1170
01:41:27,721 --> 01:41:27,921
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1171
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:29,583
[SPEAKER_25]: And my last question is,

1172
01:41:31,102 --> 01:41:34,363
[SPEAKER_25]: Why are we negotiating with companies that don't have equipment?

1173
01:41:34,503 --> 01:41:40,324
[SPEAKER_25]: Why are we negotiating with companies that don't have equipment that have to go out and buy it?

1174
01:41:40,364 --> 01:41:45,446
[SPEAKER_19]: So there are only three waste haulers in this area that are large enough to service the city of Medford.

1175
01:41:45,986 --> 01:41:51,107
[SPEAKER_19]: Any one of them typically only owns the vehicles that they need to service their current clients.

1176
01:41:51,528 --> 01:41:55,909
[SPEAKER_19]: And when they take on a new client, they then obtain the vehicles and hire the staff.

1177
01:41:55,929 --> 01:41:58,349
[SPEAKER_19]: So they don't have these extra vehicles sitting around.

1178
01:41:58,449 --> 01:42:00,270
[SPEAKER_25]: How many trucks are needed to

1179
01:42:01,010 --> 01:42:01,711
[SPEAKER_25]: support and benefit.

1180
01:42:02,031 --> 01:42:02,791
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know that number.

1181
01:42:02,811 --> 01:42:02,992
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah.

1182
01:42:03,012 --> 01:42:07,515
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, so we're in the worst time to hire people.

1183
01:42:07,535 --> 01:42:08,876
[SPEAKER_25]: We can't hire people to do anything.

1184
01:42:09,537 --> 01:42:13,520
[SPEAKER_25]: And we're looking at companies that don't have people and don't have trucks.

1185
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:15,581
[SPEAKER_19]: It's sorry, it's a public bid.

1186
01:42:16,081 --> 01:42:24,948
[SPEAKER_19]: So the companies that could consider this are waste management, Casella, and Republic services, which recently bought JRM.

1187
01:42:24,968 --> 01:42:26,449
[SPEAKER_19]: They're the companies that are large enough.

1188
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:29,992
[SPEAKER_19]: None of those companies have extra trucks sitting around.

1189
01:42:30,212 --> 01:42:31,993
[SPEAKER_25]: Well, we're currently using Waste Management, correct?

1190
01:42:32,053 --> 01:42:32,273
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

1191
01:42:32,493 --> 01:42:33,393
[SPEAKER_25]: And they have trucks.

1192
01:42:33,453 --> 01:42:34,834
[SPEAKER_19]: Their trucks are at end of life.

1193
01:42:34,874 --> 01:42:35,654
[SPEAKER_19]: They spoke to us.

1194
01:42:35,694 --> 01:42:41,577
[SPEAKER_19]: They said, we'll happily extend your contract, but we need to do it for many years because we need to buy new trucks.

1195
01:42:41,637 --> 01:42:44,298
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't have a problem extending the contract, but I have a problem.

1196
01:42:44,878 --> 01:42:49,200
[SPEAKER_25]: Are they going to be able to get trucks in less than a year?

1197
01:42:49,540 --> 01:42:53,262
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're actually working with Waste Management to extend for a year.

1198
01:42:54,015 --> 01:43:06,562
[SPEAKER_19]: in order to allow more competition, so that this could be out to bid for, we believe it should be out to bid for 90 days, and then that we'd like to give whichever company wins a year to ramp up.

1199
01:43:06,642 --> 01:43:12,885
[SPEAKER_25]: I appreciate that because I say, people can't get cars, getting enough trucks to

1200
01:43:15,619 --> 01:43:16,179
[SPEAKER_25]: shares me.

1201
01:43:16,499 --> 01:43:16,800
Thank you.

1202
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:17,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1203
01:43:17,300 --> 01:43:19,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Carter hello, Dr. Hunter have you finished your presentation.

1204
01:43:20,181 --> 01:43:24,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, just wanted to make sure I just had one question for you myself.

1205
01:43:26,103 --> 01:43:38,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know and I'm sure we're not going to have real figures until after an RFP and after the bid process comes back but the waste contract has been a major driver cost increase driver in the city budget over the last two decades.

1206
01:43:39,608 --> 01:43:40,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we looking at

1207
01:43:41,150 --> 01:43:43,692
[SPEAKER_06]: million more a year, 2 million more a year.

1208
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:46,214
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any estimates from comparable communities around us?

1209
01:43:47,115 --> 01:43:48,436
[SPEAKER_19]: It's unclear.

1210
01:43:49,517 --> 01:43:55,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Because one of the things we think we need to do is shift around the services to meet what people are asking for.

1211
01:43:55,482 --> 01:43:59,405
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's we're working, we have a consulting firm that is working with us.

1212
01:43:59,785 --> 01:44:04,069
[SPEAKER_19]: They have expertise from around the country and from New England, from Massachusetts,

1213
01:44:04,468 --> 01:44:05,969
[SPEAKER_19]: negotiating with these companies.

1214
01:44:06,449 --> 01:44:08,589
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're working with us to advise us.

1215
01:44:09,630 --> 01:44:16,192
[SPEAKER_19]: What I basically I've said to people, nobody in Medford has negotiated one of these in 14 years, 13 years.

1216
01:44:16,652 --> 01:44:19,953
[SPEAKER_19]: So we brought in an outside consulting firm to advise us.

1217
01:44:20,313 --> 01:44:23,395
[SPEAKER_19]: So they are working with us on this project.

1218
01:44:24,975 --> 01:44:27,176
[SPEAKER_19]: Our goal is to keep it cost neutral.

1219
01:44:27,276 --> 01:44:30,317
[SPEAKER_19]: We are right now working on essentially a cost neutral

1220
01:44:30,999 --> 01:44:33,400
[SPEAKER_19]: increase extension for one year.

1221
01:44:33,720 --> 01:44:40,424
[SPEAKER_19]: We're looking at something that would be under $100,000 increase for the new fiscal year to stay in the extra.

1222
01:44:41,084 --> 01:44:43,945
[SPEAKER_19]: But we don't know when we go out to bed.

1223
01:44:44,385 --> 01:44:51,289
[SPEAKER_19]: And honestly, if we ask for weekly recycling and weekly trash, that's going to be a cost increase.

1224
01:44:51,749 --> 01:44:59,993
[SPEAKER_19]: If we fold in other services, how we do this, it's unclear, especially we think that our rates with waste management are actually

1225
01:45:00,604 --> 01:45:05,486
[SPEAKER_19]: high for pickups, but low for what they charge us for disposal of recycling.

1226
01:45:05,806 --> 01:45:08,567
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're, we're sort of figuring that out right now.

1227
01:45:09,027 --> 01:45:20,951
[SPEAKER_19]: We have been doing one of the things Madeline has done is we have a large chart comparing all the services that are provided waste services to other communities, and through the government, and what other pricing is.

1228
01:45:21,371 --> 01:45:26,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Madeline has gotten a hold of several of the neighboring communities contracts and she's been reviewing

1229
01:45:27,257 --> 01:45:29,999
[SPEAKER_19]: what's in their contracts, what's different from our contracts.

1230
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:36,985
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's also some of the work that we're doing right now during these couple of months, as we get the RFP ready.

1231
01:45:37,345 --> 01:45:37,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1232
01:45:37,846 --> 01:45:42,249
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds like we're gonna have a few more bites of this apple, so I'll leave my questions for later.

1233
01:45:43,470 --> 01:45:43,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Anything else?

1234
01:45:45,352 --> 01:45:45,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

1235
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:54,652
[SPEAKER_25]: Alicia, I know many other communities don't do business pickup, commercial pickups.

1236
01:45:55,732 --> 01:46:00,315
[SPEAKER_25]: Is that something we're looking to continue or not continue with?

1237
01:46:00,869 --> 01:46:08,615
[SPEAKER_19]: I would say that is something that we've been having some conversations about it's one of the reasons why we really need to hear from from businesses.

1238
01:46:09,336 --> 01:46:20,705
[SPEAKER_19]: It's, there are very strong pros and cons to doing business pickup, including if all businesses get from the same service and you have fewer trucks on your streets and you have more consistency and you can standardize stuff.

1239
01:46:22,225 --> 01:46:23,526
[SPEAKER_19]: should we be paying for that?

1240
01:46:23,926 --> 01:46:34,033
[SPEAKER_19]: We currently have been paying for it for many, many, many, most small businesses get their waste services through the city and the large companies with dumpsters do not get them through us.

1241
01:46:35,133 --> 01:46:36,134
[SPEAKER_19]: So is that fair?

1242
01:46:36,214 --> 01:46:37,435
[SPEAKER_19]: That's hard to say that's fair.

1243
01:46:37,615 --> 01:46:44,579
[SPEAKER_19]: On the other hand, those small businesses have built their business model around an expectation that they get waste services from the city.

1244
01:46:44,979 --> 01:46:47,261
[SPEAKER_19]: And we can't just rip that rug out from under them.

1245
01:46:47,641 --> 01:46:55,787
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's one of the conversations that I think we honestly need to be having, but it's not clear to me that we can just make that change.

1246
01:46:57,007 --> 01:46:59,469
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't figured out yet what's the right thing to do.

1247
01:46:59,709 --> 01:47:01,691
[SPEAKER_19]: We'd really like to hear more from businesses.

1248
01:47:02,771 --> 01:47:03,692
[SPEAKER_25]: And one last question.

1249
01:47:04,392 --> 01:47:04,993
[SPEAKER_25]: Where do we go?

1250
01:47:05,633 --> 01:47:06,113
[SPEAKER_25]: Recycling.

1251
01:47:06,954 --> 01:47:10,496
[SPEAKER_25]: I know the recycling market isn't what it was when we made the contract.

1252
01:47:11,977 --> 01:47:14,759
[SPEAKER_25]: I know some communities have done away with recycling.

1253
01:47:16,428 --> 01:47:22,613
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not legal to do away with recycling Massachusetts, people recycle on their own.

1254
01:47:22,973 --> 01:47:29,598
[SPEAKER_19]: So, the state law is that anybody who provides trash services must provide recycling services.

1255
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:32,881
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to tell you that that's not well enforced.

1256
01:47:33,381 --> 01:47:37,745
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's not always true but that is in fact the state law as a municipality.

1257
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:41,147
[SPEAKER_19]: we have to provide both if we provide one.

1258
01:47:42,627 --> 01:47:48,010
[SPEAKER_19]: How we do that, there's been a talk about should we go back to separating our recycling?

1259
01:47:48,050 --> 01:47:51,111
[SPEAKER_19]: Should we put, because then your recycling is more valuable.

1260
01:47:52,072 --> 01:47:55,033
[SPEAKER_19]: That is absolutely a conversation that's worthy of having.

1261
01:47:55,914 --> 01:47:59,876
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of what we'd really like to do is educate people on recycling right.

1262
01:48:00,756 --> 01:48:04,498
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of the problem is when people put things in recycling that shouldn't be recycled.

1263
01:48:04,958 --> 01:48:06,739
[SPEAKER_19]: We also know that people are putting things

1264
01:48:07,145 --> 01:48:09,106
[SPEAKER_19]: in trash that shouldn't go in trash.

1265
01:48:09,526 --> 01:48:13,628
[SPEAKER_19]: City has just started up another curbside pickup for textiles.

1266
01:48:14,108 --> 01:48:16,129
[SPEAKER_19]: Textiles don't need to go in the trash.

1267
01:48:16,609 --> 01:48:20,310
[SPEAKER_19]: It saves the city money because we pay by the pound for trash.

1268
01:48:20,810 --> 01:48:29,174
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you don't put it in the trash, if you put it in the bins at the school or you call help see the new, the new curbside that we have saves us all money.

1269
01:48:30,034 --> 01:48:31,295
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a number of other things.

1270
01:48:31,355 --> 01:48:34,936
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a mattress ban about to go into effect in the state of Massachusetts.

1271
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:44,032
[SPEAKER_19]: So right now DPW actually Madeline is working with our DPW staff to figure out the solution for how can Medford residents dispose of mattresses.

1272
01:48:45,853 --> 01:48:49,474
[SPEAKER_19]: You won't be able to call waste management and have them just pick it up.

1273
01:48:49,654 --> 01:48:55,375
[SPEAKER_19]: We need a contract with somebody to pick them up and recycle them, deconstruct them.

1274
01:48:55,995 --> 01:48:58,516
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's something, honestly, I don't know where it stands right now.

1275
01:48:58,556 --> 01:49:00,336
[SPEAKER_19]: Madeline is helping DPW with it.

1276
01:49:01,237 --> 01:49:02,937
[SPEAKER_19]: So these are the various things that are,

1277
01:49:03,584 --> 01:49:05,386
[SPEAKER_19]: We need people to better understand.

1278
01:49:05,406 --> 01:49:15,156
[SPEAKER_19]: I will take this moment to tell everybody that on the city's website and on the Go Green Medford website under recycling is a link to something that's called the Recyclopedia.

1279
01:49:15,176 --> 01:49:17,719
[SPEAKER_19]: And it is a, can I recycle this?

1280
01:49:17,799 --> 01:49:18,700
[SPEAKER_19]: What can be recycled?

1281
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:24,866
[SPEAKER_19]: You can type anything into that and it will tell you what can be recycled or how you should dispose of things.

1282
01:49:27,120 --> 01:49:31,543
[SPEAKER_19]: And you should know that it's the same in whatever community you're in in Massachusetts.

1283
01:49:32,064 --> 01:49:43,572
[SPEAKER_19]: So several years ago, they figured out that part of the problem was people were confused, they didn't know it could be recycled, and they'd go between communities and work and stuff and their friends, and it was all different.

1284
01:49:44,013 --> 01:49:56,562
[SPEAKER_19]: So the state sat down with all the waste haulers, the big ones, and negotiated a list of what can be recycled through the curbside pickup versus other systems, and put it all into a database.

1285
01:49:56,987 --> 01:50:02,832
[SPEAKER_19]: And that is the final say as to what can be recycled in Massachusetts in any community.

1286
01:50:03,192 --> 01:50:04,894
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's linked from our website.

1287
01:50:04,934 --> 01:50:07,035
[SPEAKER_19]: We put it out on social media occasionally.

1288
01:50:08,517 --> 01:50:10,438
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully that all helps.

1289
01:50:10,618 --> 01:50:13,361
[SPEAKER_19]: And if anybody's wondering, it's exactly the same in our schools.

1290
01:50:13,901 --> 01:50:17,544
[SPEAKER_19]: School waste contracts are actually part of the city contract as well.

1291
01:50:18,005 --> 01:50:20,747
[SPEAKER_19]: So we are taking that into account and consulting this.

1292
01:50:21,697 --> 01:50:25,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you so much, Director Hunt.

1293
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:29,184
[SPEAKER_06]: 22-502 to President Nicole Morell and honorable members, Medford City Council, from Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

1294
01:50:29,985 --> 01:50:30,865
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, do we need to vote on that?

1295
01:50:31,146 --> 01:50:32,547
[SPEAKER_06]: We do need to vote on that, yep, sorry.

1296
01:50:33,007 --> 01:50:38,633
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Caraviello to receive and place on file.

1297
01:50:40,374 --> 01:50:40,995
[SPEAKER_06]: All those in favor?

1298
01:50:41,015 --> 01:50:42,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Opposed?

1299
01:50:42,436 --> 01:50:43,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1300
01:50:43,577 --> 01:50:45,479
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will leave the reading of 22-502 to the president.

1301
01:51:08,342 --> 01:51:10,166
[SPEAKER_15]: The rules are already suspended to take these two papers.

1302
01:51:13,745 --> 01:51:19,928
[SPEAKER_15]: 22-502, to President Nicole Morell and honorable members of the Medford City Council, from Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, proposed CAF amendment.

1303
01:51:20,808 --> 01:51:37,515
[SPEAKER_15]: September 8th, 2022, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approve the following amendment to the revised ordinances entitled Personnel, Article II, entitled Classification and Compensation Plan, section 66-33, entitled Officers and Employees-Nonunion, by adopting the following change.

1304
01:51:37,575 --> 01:51:41,577
[SPEAKER_15]: The language of CAF 14 shall be amended to include the following position, Senior Planner,

1305
01:51:42,197 --> 01:51:47,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Planning Development and Sustainability Director Alicia Hunt is available to speak to this request and answer any questions you may have.

1306
01:51:47,298 --> 01:51:49,238
[SPEAKER_15]: Respectfully submitted, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, Mayor.

1307
01:51:51,659 --> 01:51:52,959
[SPEAKER_15]: Director Hunt, if you'd like to.

1308
01:51:52,979 --> 01:52:01,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, motion to table until such time as the overwhelmingly large and looming labor relations problems that we have in this community can be addressed.

1309
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,101
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it's time to create another position.

1310
01:52:03,321 --> 01:52:05,621
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have another position that's gonna cost us more money.

1311
01:52:06,041 --> 01:52:10,962
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't have another position that's gonna cost us more money that's being created 60 days after the passage of the budget.

1312
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:15,784
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to table as seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1313
01:52:16,986 --> 01:52:18,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1314
01:52:18,167 --> 01:52:20,670
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, we have two Councilors absent at the moment.

1315
01:52:24,174 --> 01:52:32,463
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'm happy to... If you wanna give a moment to allow the other Councilors.

1316
01:52:43,274 --> 01:52:52,321
[SPEAKER_13]: It's, you're gonna have to ask him.

1317
01:52:52,521 --> 01:52:53,442
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1318
01:52:53,962 --> 01:52:56,304
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanna make a point, two points really.

1319
01:52:56,865 --> 01:53:09,354
[SPEAKER_06]: One, that I think that there's a lot of value to this position, but that we haven't received the response still from the city solicitor regarding CAF changes and chapter 44, section 33A that we requested in January.

1320
01:53:10,404 --> 01:53:21,733
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just was pulling out the green book to reread chapter four section 33 a, and I think it's gonna require a two thirds vote we don't know because we haven't gotten that opinion back so this just falls into that.

1321
01:53:22,574 --> 01:53:24,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, I would like I would vote for it.

1322
01:53:25,097 --> 01:53:33,103
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it needs a two thirds vote, and we don't know the answer to that because we haven't gotten the legal opinion for nine months, that's just going to put us in a position of uncertainty.

1323
01:53:33,163 --> 01:53:34,184
[SPEAKER_19]: Could I ask one question?

1324
01:53:34,324 --> 01:53:35,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that about a CAF change?

1325
01:53:35,925 --> 01:53:37,787
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not asking to change a CAF.

1326
01:53:37,867 --> 01:53:42,090
[SPEAKER_19]: We're asking for a new position that doesn't exist in the CAF system.

1327
01:53:44,284 --> 01:53:49,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if legal, whatever, get back to us and answer our underlying and initial question, I'm sure that we'd be able to answer that question.

1328
01:53:49,169 --> 01:53:53,834
[SPEAKER_08]: But as of right now, it's been almost about a year and we still haven't received that information.

1329
01:53:54,114 --> 01:53:56,717
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is not a change to the land use planner.

1330
01:53:56,737 --> 01:53:57,598
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a new position.

1331
01:53:58,218 --> 01:54:05,265
[SPEAKER_19]: We do not have a position in the system that is a senior planner.

1332
01:54:05,666 --> 01:54:06,747
[SPEAKER_19]: The intention would be

1333
01:54:07,328 --> 01:54:16,173
[SPEAKER_19]: to we have had posted a staff planner position, we would with we have other staff planners, so we can't we can't remove that from the cap system.

1334
01:54:16,633 --> 01:54:23,017
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't want to change the calf of the staff planner, okay, we have people hired at that position and we want to keep that.

1335
01:54:23,517 --> 01:54:27,019
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a new position senior planner that does not exist in the city.

1336
01:54:27,219 --> 01:54:34,884
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I withdraw what I just said I was reading the memo that we got was like saying that we have this position it's not so we would.

1337
01:54:36,126 --> 01:54:48,531
[SPEAKER_19]: not fill the position that has been posted for 14 months, and we would post this position instead, but that staff planner, Amanda Centrella is a staff planner in our office.

1338
01:54:49,012 --> 01:54:51,033
[SPEAKER_19]: Her CAF is not up for discussion.

1339
01:54:51,153 --> 01:54:52,053
[SPEAKER_19]: It would not be changed.

1340
01:54:52,093 --> 01:54:55,955
[SPEAKER_19]: It would not change any current staff planners in the office.

1341
01:54:56,455 --> 01:54:58,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then that changes this.

1342
01:54:58,616 --> 01:55:00,797
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, I don't think this section applies, but...

1343
01:55:02,668 --> 01:55:07,749
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, my point on the section does stand that it would be nice to get a response on that after nine months.

1344
01:55:14,431 --> 01:55:17,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I stand with the workers that were before us here this evening and reintroduce my motion.

1345
01:55:17,672 --> 01:55:27,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't feel as though we should be creating positions two months after the budget passed, after we've talked about how we have no revenues, about how we had to sit here and fight tooth and nail for what we asked for for eight months.

1346
01:55:27,934 --> 01:55:29,394
[SPEAKER_08]: And now all of a sudden we have more money.

1347
01:55:29,914 --> 01:55:32,235
[SPEAKER_08]: We have more money to create a new position, but we don't have more money.

1348
01:55:33,478 --> 01:55:38,400
[SPEAKER_08]: on cost of living adjustments that are recordable across the board for our school department employees.

1349
01:55:38,480 --> 01:55:44,642
[SPEAKER_08]: And we have eight collective bargaining agreements that right now are at an impasse or not being negotiated.

1350
01:55:44,862 --> 01:55:48,763
[SPEAKER_08]: And quite frankly, these contracts that are expired, they expired quite some time ago.

1351
01:55:48,783 --> 01:55:53,084
[SPEAKER_08]: So once they get settled, they're just going to expire again and they're going to be right back at the table in the next six to eight months.

1352
01:55:53,725 --> 01:56:00,567
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I reintroduce my motion to have this matter tabled until the labor relations dispute and the contracts are settled.

1353
01:56:01,342 --> 01:56:04,443
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to table a paper until the labor relations- Madam President.

1354
01:56:04,783 --> 01:56:08,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scarpelli, just a reminder that the motions at this table are not debatable.

1355
01:56:08,843 --> 01:56:09,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I would second that.

1356
01:56:09,963 --> 01:56:11,984
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

1357
01:56:12,004 --> 01:56:21,365
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight to table the paper, table paper 22-502 until the labor relations and disputes are settled, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1358
01:56:21,385 --> 01:56:22,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1359
01:56:23,706 --> 01:56:24,426
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Bears.

1360
01:56:25,486 --> 01:56:25,846
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1361
01:56:27,446 --> 01:56:28,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Caraviello.

1362
01:56:28,107 --> 01:56:28,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1363
01:56:29,947 --> 01:56:30,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins.

1364
01:56:31,002 --> 01:56:33,323
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1365
01:56:33,903 --> 01:56:35,583
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1366
01:56:35,723 --> 01:56:36,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1367
01:56:38,744 --> 01:56:38,984
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1368
01:56:41,005 --> 01:56:44,026
[SPEAKER_15]: No, three in the front of four in the negative.

1369
01:56:45,606 --> 01:56:46,666
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Hunt.

1370
01:56:46,686 --> 01:56:59,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Madam President, I asked for a ruling from the chairs that how many votes it takes to pass this calf, and whether or not chapter 44 twice, and I don't really know Zach's reading it for you know what, almost as good as what we have which is no lawyer but

1371
01:57:06,455 --> 01:57:06,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1372
01:57:07,055 --> 01:57:19,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, before the table, I wish I had the opportunity to speak before but again, these are situations that has nothing personal to do with the position, but the clarification of what we haven't had yet.

1373
01:57:20,481 --> 01:57:32,018
[SPEAKER_03]: And then again, to my, to my fellow Councilors that remember the days that we were told one thing and then not not given the proper answers what we needed and here we are again.

1374
01:57:32,038 --> 01:57:34,121
[SPEAKER_03]: We just spoke to 500 people.

1375
01:57:35,743 --> 01:57:43,949
[SPEAKER_03]: and told them that we support them, no matter what, that this administration is not following through with our union employees and what do we just do?

1376
01:57:44,489 --> 01:57:46,890
[SPEAKER_03]: We just voted four to three not to table it.

1377
01:57:48,251 --> 01:57:50,313
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm waiting to see what the next vote's going to be.

1378
01:57:50,393 --> 01:57:51,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information.

1379
01:57:51,153 --> 01:57:51,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1380
01:57:51,574 --> 01:57:53,335
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

1381
01:57:53,615 --> 01:57:55,476
[SPEAKER_06]: All of that vote was to keep talking about it.

1382
01:57:55,956 --> 01:58:02,861
[SPEAKER_03]: So my, what I just said to end that was, I can't wait to see the next motion.

1383
01:58:02,921 --> 01:58:03,742
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I want to say.

1384
01:58:03,782 --> 01:58:04,042
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1385
01:58:06,073 --> 01:58:14,215
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just saying, let's hold the outrage until there's something to be outraged.

1386
01:58:14,255 --> 01:58:25,178
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe in June we discussed that with the mayor and we were talking about the budget, that document that you know sets up the spending for the next fiscal year which we're in now.

1387
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:31,440
[SPEAKER_08]: That document, we talked about having an assistant city solicitor position to the city council, I believe.

1388
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:38,422
[SPEAKER_08]: And the mayor came back to this council and made a compromise and said, yeah, if you vote for my budget, I'm gonna give you guys that.

1389
01:58:38,903 --> 01:58:40,403
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's gonna be posted in September.

1390
01:58:41,324 --> 01:58:46,025
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's September and we don't even have a regular city solicitor, nevermind an assistant city solicitor for this council.

1391
01:58:46,866 --> 01:58:49,887
[SPEAKER_08]: We have legal questions that have been looming for nine months that haven't been answered.

1392
01:58:50,547 --> 01:58:52,728
[SPEAKER_08]: We can talk about this stuff, so we're blue in the face.

1393
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:57,630
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an irresponsible vote to take right now without the response from the city solicitor that we asked for nine months ago.

1394
01:59:00,522 --> 01:59:00,762
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1395
01:59:01,423 --> 01:59:01,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam President.

1396
01:59:02,423 --> 01:59:03,063
[SPEAKER_15]: President Bears.

1397
01:59:03,904 --> 01:59:16,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Chapter 44, section 33A, no new position shall be created or increase in rate made by ordinance vote or appointment during the financial year subsequent to the submission of the annual budget unless provision therefore has been made by means of a supplemental appropriation.

1398
01:59:16,631 --> 01:59:22,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Given that there hasn't been a supplemental appropriation made to fund this position, I think 33A still applies.

1399
01:59:23,195 --> 01:59:28,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I would make a motion to request that we get a response to our questions from January on 33A

1400
01:59:30,373 --> 01:59:31,513
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be my first motion.

1401
01:59:31,533 --> 01:59:32,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me just table the thing.

1402
01:59:32,953 --> 01:59:33,534
[SPEAKER_07]: This is crazy.

1403
01:59:33,594 --> 01:59:42,195
[SPEAKER_15]: And then my second motion would be to table it.

1404
01:59:42,655 --> 01:59:45,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should respect the chair and all just speak at once.

1405
01:59:46,396 --> 01:59:48,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Like let's let one person talk and then another person talk.

1406
01:59:50,176 --> 01:59:55,157
[SPEAKER_06]: My first motion would be that we again reiterate that we get the information that we need and the legal opinion on that chapter.

1407
01:59:55,757 --> 01:59:58,578
[SPEAKER_06]: And then since it's not debatable, I would make a motion to table.

1408
02:00:01,614 --> 02:00:04,055
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have a motion to take the first motion.

1409
02:00:04,095 --> 02:00:06,676
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion is to ask once again for that legal opinion.

1410
02:00:06,756 --> 02:00:06,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1411
02:00:23,404 --> 02:00:31,809
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of vice president bears to ask legal opinion rated in the calf sent to whoever is handling legal opinions at this a minute, send it to the mayor.

1412
02:00:33,110 --> 02:00:36,312
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a second for that motion.

1413
02:00:36,332 --> 02:00:37,853
[SPEAKER_15]: So, Councilor Collins.

1414
02:00:39,094 --> 02:00:39,794
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor.

1415
02:00:39,814 --> 02:00:42,115
[SPEAKER_15]: I suppose the motion passes.

1416
02:00:47,071 --> 02:00:51,834
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand it's amusing to some Councilors, but this is fact finding and this is debate.

1417
02:00:51,874 --> 02:00:54,256
[SPEAKER_03]: So I- It's amusing because it's frustrating.

1418
02:00:54,296 --> 02:00:58,699
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't make this a joke because it's not amusing because I'm happy.

1419
02:00:59,139 --> 02:01:00,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Only one person- Thank you.

1420
02:01:01,140 --> 02:01:01,721
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1421
02:01:03,502 --> 02:01:06,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there were 550 people that weren't happy.

1422
02:01:06,924 --> 02:01:10,827
[SPEAKER_15]: I said- On the motion of Vice President Bears to table a second by- Comments.

1423
02:01:13,095 --> 02:01:15,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tseng Mr. Clerk, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1424
02:01:20,539 --> 02:01:20,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1425
02:01:20,919 --> 02:01:21,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1426
02:01:36,840 --> 02:01:37,100
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1427
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:37,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1428
02:01:37,481 --> 02:01:37,841
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1429
02:01:37,861 --> 02:01:39,622
[SPEAKER_15]: 22504 22504 is what we're moving on to.

1430
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:11,403
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Councilor Collins, which paper is 22-504?

1431
02:02:11,423 --> 02:02:15,724
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the one offered under suspension by Vice President Ferris.

1432
02:02:15,965 --> 02:02:18,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1433
02:02:18,906 --> 02:02:21,867
[SPEAKER_15]: Do I have a, I have that paper.

1434
02:02:24,608 --> 02:02:30,010
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, 22-504 was offered under suspension by Vice President Ferris.

1435
02:02:31,192 --> 02:02:41,897
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we are deeply concerned by the negative impact on essential operations due to the recent removals of staff members for non-performance related reasons of the Finance Department and Elections Department.

1436
02:02:41,917 --> 02:02:42,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Bears.

1437
02:02:43,255 --> 02:03:03,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President, I think this speaks exactly to what all of us were just talking about around the labor relations situation in the city I want to speak specifically to two recent changes, where we've decided that this city administration, I should say because we don't have any voice in it's the city administration has decided to change horses and midstream on two major important projects.

1438
02:03:04,360 --> 02:03:07,401
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them being in the finance department around ARPA.

1439
02:03:08,261 --> 02:03:18,244
[SPEAKER_06]: We had an ARPA federal funds manager who was working for the city for six months, who had done extensive work on the process for the determination of the spending of the remaining ARPA funds.

1440
02:03:19,064 --> 02:03:25,466
[SPEAKER_06]: That person, as far as we know, was removed from her position for non performance related reasons.

1441
02:03:26,286 --> 02:03:28,207
[SPEAKER_06]: I do know that that position has now been filled.

1442
02:03:28,847 --> 02:03:45,057
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've had a gap of months where we could have been working diligently as a city on the process for spending our money and determining public input, and that has paused so you know, again as far as I understand it was not a performance related reason or disciplinary reason for the removal of that person.

1443
02:03:45,597 --> 02:03:47,999
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it has negatively impacted city operations.

1444
02:03:48,819 --> 02:03:53,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Secondly, we found out yesterday that there was a removal of the coordinator overseeing the elections.

1445
02:03:53,663 --> 02:04:04,191
[SPEAKER_06]: We just held a primary election that by all accounts went off very well using a new system that was created to streamline and simplify and make our elections better.

1446
02:04:04,652 --> 02:04:06,533
[SPEAKER_06]: We now have a general election in November.

1447
02:04:06,593 --> 02:04:12,458
[SPEAKER_06]: We've decided again during the middle of an election between a primary and a general election to change the leadership of the elections department.

1448
02:04:12,958 --> 02:04:14,619
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it behooves this council to send

1449
02:04:15,580 --> 02:04:21,623
[SPEAKER_06]: a resolution to the mayor that we are concerned by these and these specific decisions.

1450
02:04:21,703 --> 02:04:28,206
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously, as we've spoken to tonight, there's deep concern that we all share around decisions on a wide range of labor issues.

1451
02:04:28,766 --> 02:04:33,889
[SPEAKER_06]: But I felt that it was important to propose this under suspension as we found out about one of these things.

1452
02:04:34,569 --> 02:04:38,391
[SPEAKER_06]: One of these changes after the deadline for the agenda was to be posted.

1453
02:04:38,591 --> 02:04:39,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1454
02:04:39,952 --> 02:04:40,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Bears.

1455
02:04:40,612 --> 02:04:42,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any further discussion?

1456
02:04:46,100 --> 02:04:52,207
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion by Vice President Bear is a second by Councilor Collins.

1457
02:04:54,389 --> 02:04:54,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you're seconding?

1458
02:04:56,989 --> 02:04:57,929
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I just raised my hand.

1459
02:04:57,949 --> 02:05:03,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so on the motion of vices and bears a second by cancer Collins cancer saying did you want to speak Sorry, I don't know.

1460
02:05:03,351 --> 02:05:03,751
[SPEAKER_15]: Go for it.

1461
02:05:03,971 --> 02:05:04,411
[SPEAKER_15]: Go for it.

1462
02:05:04,851 --> 02:05:18,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I just want to reiterate the point we can't be retaliating against people I mean, of course, you know, we, the mayor's office is yet to say anything about this, and honestly we need transparency but we

1463
02:05:19,257 --> 02:05:22,040
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something, something's gotta, something's gotta change.

1464
02:05:22,140 --> 02:05:27,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can't, we're not, we can't get the best city government we can by operating like this.

1465
02:05:28,285 --> 02:05:37,373
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have an election coming up in a few weeks, and it's just, without communicating why or what happened, I mean, it's really unacceptable.

1466
02:05:41,485 --> 02:05:42,246
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you President Morell.

1467
02:05:43,346 --> 02:05:45,428
[SPEAKER_23]: I just I think it deserves to be repeated.

1468
02:05:45,448 --> 02:06:05,202
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't think that Medford can currently say that it's delivering the city services and the civil services that the residents deserve and it's not delivering the workplace atmosphere compensation and benefits that its staffers deserve, and that makes these inscrutable dismissals, just all the more challenging to.

1469
02:06:06,497 --> 02:06:29,069
[SPEAKER_23]: to see and to understand when we are already struggling to serve our residents the way that a 21st century city should, why we would dismiss city employees who are willing to forego greener pastures in the private sector for the mission of trying to do good work in a municipal setting in the city of Medford, it just boggles the mind.

1470
02:06:29,850 --> 02:06:33,632
[SPEAKER_23]: And I thank Vice President Bears for putting this forward tonight because it needs to be said.

1471
02:06:34,472 --> 02:06:35,173
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1472
02:06:35,193 --> 02:06:35,873
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

1473
02:06:37,438 --> 02:06:40,320
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Bears, I second by Councilor Collins.

1474
02:06:41,121 --> 02:06:41,781
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1475
02:06:42,082 --> 02:06:42,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

1476
02:06:42,562 --> 02:06:43,323
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1477
02:06:44,003 --> 02:06:44,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1478
02:06:44,764 --> 02:06:52,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Communications from the mayor, 22-466.

1479

[SPEAKER_15]: To the members, to the Honorable President and members of Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155, August 23rd, 2022, President Morell,

On the motion of Councilor Knight to waive the remainder of the reading, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor.

1483
02:08:16,345 --> 02:08:17,745
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, motion passes.

1484
02:08:20,066 --> 02:08:21,226
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you both for being here once again.

1485
02:08:21,246 --> 02:08:23,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, for those folks watching, we did get a presentation over the summer.

1486
02:08:23,947 --> 02:08:25,648
[SPEAKER_15]: I forget if it was july or august.

1487
02:08:25,668 --> 02:08:27,028
[SPEAKER_15]: So I appreciate the presentation then.

1488
02:08:27,148 --> 02:08:29,009
[SPEAKER_15]: And I, um, give the floor to you.

1489
02:08:29,269 --> 02:08:32,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Just name and address the record and then just, uh, what you'd like to share.

1490
02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:37,231
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm dan stone king.

1491
02:08:37,251 --> 02:08:37,611
[SPEAKER_20]: 21 james street.

1492
02:08:37,671 --> 02:08:38,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, ron baker, 21 james street.

1493
02:08:44,074 --> 02:08:49,057
[SPEAKER_15]: If you wanna give us a brief summary, I know we had a full presentation this summer, but just a brief summary of the paper before us.

1494
02:08:49,758 --> 02:08:50,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1495
02:08:51,319 --> 02:08:53,280
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to get this water meter program going.

1496
02:08:55,221 --> 02:08:58,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Is a MWRA loan, 0% 10 years.

1497
02:09:00,584 --> 02:09:10,250
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a November 15 allocation in which we need city council to vote to support it.

1498
02:09:16,608 --> 02:09:22,971
[SPEAKER_09]: 0% loan is $7.8 million, and it's 10 years interest free.

1499
02:09:23,411 --> 02:09:32,415
[SPEAKER_09]: I did give out some paperwork, explain, because there were some questions from Councilor Bears, how much we've already used from MWRA funds.

1500
02:09:33,035 --> 02:09:40,178
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a couple of pages of what the funds could be used for, and there's some spreadsheets

1501
02:09:41,602 --> 02:09:44,063
[SPEAKER_09]: our community and other communities and what we've used.

1502
02:09:44,984 --> 02:09:46,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Phase one has passed.

1503
02:09:47,745 --> 02:09:50,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Phase two is sunsetting fiscal year 23.

1504
02:09:50,967 --> 02:10:00,432
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's about $3.2 million that if you don't use by the end of fiscal 23, that it will just go away.

1505
02:10:00,452 --> 02:10:04,314
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't use about $2.5 million from phase one.

1506
02:10:06,044 --> 02:10:09,565
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at some of the other communities, most communities do take advantage of this.

1507
02:10:10,146 --> 02:10:10,806
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good loan.

1508
02:10:10,826 --> 02:10:27,313
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a good way to get the meters installed and get funds back up and running at 100% accuracy, so that we can maintain the $26 million one or two enterprise accounts.

1509
02:10:29,634 --> 02:10:29,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1510
02:10:33,108 --> 02:10:36,349
[SPEAKER_03]: John, thank you very much for your hard work in answering some of these questions.

1511
02:10:36,869 --> 02:10:39,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is an easy question for me.

1512
02:10:40,470 --> 02:10:47,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Fundamentally, if this doesn't happen, how difficult would this make our system?

1513
02:10:49,893 --> 02:10:54,034
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, every meter has a meeting device on it right now that has a battery in it.

1514
02:10:54,114 --> 02:10:56,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Those batteries had a 10-year warranty.

1515
02:10:56,954 --> 02:10:57,455
[SPEAKER_09]: We're in year 16.

1516
02:10:58,675 --> 02:11:02,656
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've replaced some, a good majority.

1517
02:11:03,193 --> 02:11:07,555
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you're looking at a system, we put that into 2005.

1518
02:11:07,615 --> 02:11:09,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Technology's changed.

1519
02:11:10,316 --> 02:11:18,920
[SPEAKER_09]: We're looking to better the system so that we can not only bill 100% accurate, but have other aspects that we can

1520
02:11:20,116 --> 02:11:24,178
[SPEAKER_09]: account for unaccounted for water.

1521
02:11:24,238 --> 02:11:33,443
[SPEAKER_09]: The meter that we're looking at has built in leak detection, which would tell us if there's a water main break or a service leak in the area with acoustic sound.

1522
02:11:33,624 --> 02:11:33,804
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1523
02:11:34,344 --> 02:11:41,208
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, I think this is a slam dunk in the fact that you're talking about 0% loan, you're talking about

1524
02:11:42,357 --> 02:11:51,722
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly eliminating concerns to our residents, whether their meters are read wrong or read incorrectly, then have to adjust later, that could be crippling.

1525
02:11:52,202 --> 02:12:07,550
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that this is something that for myself, I think that it's not even thinking ahead, it's catching up and making sure that we are on the same page and working together as we move forward in the future.

1526
02:12:07,610 --> 02:12:10,071
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would look to support this paper.

1527
02:12:11,127 --> 02:12:12,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1528
02:12:12,848 --> 02:12:15,330
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry, my emotions.

1529
02:12:15,970 --> 02:12:20,093
[SPEAKER_25]: I also want to stay 100% let's take its first ring.

1530
02:12:20,733 --> 02:12:34,742
[SPEAKER_25]: My only question is, um, is the use of the opera funds, who determined that this was a good use the right proper use of opera funds, the opera director that was let go or was just determined

1531
02:12:35,570 --> 02:12:38,831
[SPEAKER_25]: in between the ARPA director leaving and us not having one.

1532
02:12:38,851 --> 02:12:40,231
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's my only question.

1533
02:12:40,732 --> 02:12:44,773
[SPEAKER_25]: Is this allowed under the use of ARPA funds?

1534
02:12:45,533 --> 02:12:46,813
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, it is allowed.

1535
02:12:47,494 --> 02:12:59,557
[SPEAKER_20]: This was kind of, I believe, an internal discussion because of what MWRA loan will do for sidewalks and road improvements.

1536
02:13:00,518 --> 02:13:02,358
[SPEAKER_20]: And we can't use that for ARPA funds.

1537
02:13:02,398 --> 02:13:04,599
[SPEAKER_20]: We'd rather use the ARPA funds for meters.

1538
02:13:05,068 --> 02:13:06,869
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have Commissioner McGivern on the line too.

1539
02:13:06,949 --> 02:13:07,750
[SPEAKER_15]: He just raised his hand.

1540
02:13:09,691 --> 02:13:09,891
[SPEAKER_25]: I can.

1541
02:13:09,931 --> 02:13:15,555
[SPEAKER_25]: I just want to make sure that the Apple money is allowed for this.

1542
02:13:16,036 --> 02:13:19,478
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't want them to come back and bite us at some point saying we shouldn't use their money.

1543
02:13:19,538 --> 02:13:22,801
[SPEAKER_25]: So I'm just asking, who made the decision to do it?

1544
02:13:22,821 --> 02:13:24,542
[SPEAKER_25]: Was it Molly Kibbe?

1545
02:13:24,882 --> 02:13:28,284
[SPEAKER_25]: Or her predecessor in between?

1546
02:13:28,304 --> 02:13:30,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Commissioner McGivern, can you speak to that?

1547
02:13:30,937 --> 02:13:31,497
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, yep.

1548
02:13:31,517 --> 02:13:38,838
[SPEAKER_24]: So it was an effort between myself, the gentleman in front of you today, Bob Dickinson, chief of staff, mayor.

1549
02:13:39,299 --> 02:13:42,179
[SPEAKER_24]: So we sat, discussed, went over the options for funding.

1550
02:13:42,779 --> 02:13:45,680
[SPEAKER_24]: This is an eligible use for ARPA funding.

1551
02:13:46,300 --> 02:13:49,100
[SPEAKER_24]: Other communities are using it for similar type of projects.

1552
02:13:50,280 --> 02:13:52,641
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's how we've made up the balance for that $700,000.

1553
02:13:52,681 --> 02:13:56,382
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I mean, I'll make the motion

1554
02:13:59,217 --> 02:14:01,639
[SPEAKER_25]: to support the paper and let it take its first reading.

1555
02:14:02,640 --> 02:14:03,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1556
02:14:03,581 --> 02:14:04,242
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Collins.

1557
02:14:06,283 --> 02:14:06,463
Great.

1558
02:14:07,084 --> 02:14:09,266
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion from the council or members of the public?

1559
02:14:12,749 --> 02:14:13,490
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Beres.

1560
02:14:13,910 --> 02:14:16,793
[SPEAKER_06]: Just confirming, and this is all going to be paid back out of the enterprise fund.

1561
02:14:18,014 --> 02:14:20,256
[SPEAKER_06]: The bonds are just going to be paid back out of the enterprise fund.

1562
02:14:22,032 --> 02:14:26,116
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, it'll be budgeted in the budget going forward.

1563
02:14:26,216 --> 02:14:26,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1564
02:14:27,177 --> 02:14:27,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1565
02:14:27,697 --> 02:14:29,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's the water and sewer bonds.

1566
02:14:29,519 --> 02:14:31,501
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the general bonds.

1567
02:14:31,581 --> 02:14:31,761
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1568
02:14:31,801 --> 02:14:34,083
[SPEAKER_06]: Just for the public's edification.

1569
02:14:34,263 --> 02:14:34,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1570
02:14:34,684 --> 02:14:35,124
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1571
02:14:35,184 --> 02:14:37,266
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have confirmation from Christian.

1572
02:14:37,286 --> 02:14:38,547
[SPEAKER_15]: We're giving him a thumbs up as well.

1573
02:14:39,768 --> 02:14:40,529
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

1574
02:14:40,789 --> 02:14:46,310
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to waive the remainder of the readings and have this matter be passed upon vote of this council this evening, Madam President.

1575
02:14:46,390 --> 02:14:49,651
[SPEAKER_08]: It will save us the trouble of having to go through advertising.

1576
02:14:49,691 --> 02:14:53,672
[SPEAKER_08]: It will save us the trouble of having to bring this paper back for a third reading.

1577
02:14:53,712 --> 02:14:55,012
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had two meetings on it already.

1578
02:14:55,072 --> 02:14:56,592
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a 0% interest loan.

1579
02:14:56,992 --> 02:14:57,613
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good idea.

1580
02:14:57,653 --> 02:14:58,153
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes sense.

1581
02:14:58,213 --> 02:14:59,493
[SPEAKER_08]: It's necessary for this community.

1582
02:14:59,513 --> 02:15:02,954
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we've been able to establish that through the two meetings that we've had previously.

1583
02:15:03,214 --> 02:15:03,934
[SPEAKER_08]: I would second that.

1584
02:15:04,774 --> 02:15:08,535
[SPEAKER_15]: We do have Councilor Scarpelli's original motion and then we'll take that as a second motion.

1585
02:15:10,064 --> 02:15:14,787
[SPEAKER_11]: do separate questions.

1586
02:15:17,289 --> 02:15:20,391
[SPEAKER_11]: There's two motions, one could be withdrawn.

1587
02:15:20,411 --> 02:15:21,711
[SPEAKER_11]: We could withdraw my first one.

1588
02:15:21,852 --> 02:15:25,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to approve in general.

1589
02:15:27,215 --> 02:15:30,537
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll just go with the others.

1590
02:15:31,438 --> 02:15:32,498
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, you take it.

1591
02:15:33,959 --> 02:15:36,001
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think that I should jump in.

1592
02:15:36,101 --> 02:15:37,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give you a sack.

1593
02:15:41,522 --> 02:15:44,503
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll take the first and we'll take the second and that should cover our basis.

1594
02:15:44,543 --> 02:15:46,124
[SPEAKER_15]: So this one's gonna be for first reading.

1595
02:15:46,264 --> 02:15:52,105
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, so on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, a second by Councilor Caraviello to approve the loan order for first reading.

1596
02:15:52,626 --> 02:15:53,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1597
02:15:56,487 --> 02:15:57,387
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Bears.

1598
02:15:59,708 --> 02:16:01,328
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, approve, waive all the ratings or?

1599
02:16:01,448 --> 02:16:02,889
[SPEAKER_15]: This is just, we're just gonna take them.

1600
02:16:02,969 --> 02:16:04,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, okay, yes, yep.

1601
02:16:05,610 --> 02:16:06,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

1602
02:16:06,450 --> 02:16:06,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1603
02:16:07,450 --> 02:16:08,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

1604
02:16:08,330 --> 02:16:08,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1605
02:16:09,231 --> 02:16:09,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

1606
02:16:09,811 --> 02:16:09,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1607
02:16:10,473 --> 02:16:11,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli, yes.

1608
02:16:12,114 --> 02:16:13,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng, President Morell.

1609
02:16:14,096 --> 02:16:22,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I'm in front of zero, then I get the motion passes on the motion of Councilor Knight to waive all future readings as seconded by Councilor Tseng.

1610
02:16:22,842 --> 02:16:23,843
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1611
02:16:40,643 --> 02:16:42,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, the motion to waive future readings and to approve.

1612
02:16:43,526 --> 02:16:44,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

1613
02:16:44,147 --> 02:16:44,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1614
02:16:44,327 --> 02:16:44,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1615
02:16:45,348 --> 02:16:45,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1616
02:16:45,529 --> 02:16:45,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1617
02:16:45,609 --> 02:16:45,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1618
02:16:45,789 --> 02:16:46,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1619
02:16:46,149 --> 02:16:46,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1620
02:17:02,088 --> 02:17:10,251
[SPEAKER_15]: 22-503 to President Nicole Morell and honorable members of the Metro City Council, from Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, regarding proposed wage adjustment for traffic supervisors.

1621
02:17:10,311 --> 02:17:18,093
[SPEAKER_15]: September 8th, 2022, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approve the following amendments to the revised ordinances, chapter 66, article two.

1622
02:17:18,774 --> 02:17:28,857
[SPEAKER_15]: City of Medford amendment to revise ordinances, chapter 66, article two, be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Medford in chapter 66, entitled personnel, article two, entitled classification and compensation plan

1623
02:17:29,539 --> 02:17:38,823
[SPEAKER_15]: section 32, I'm sorry, 66-32, section one entitled miscellaneous personnel, and then the figures as they presently appear next to the following title by adjusting.

1624
02:17:42,324 --> 02:17:49,347
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of council tonight to waive the reading in favor of their brief presentation from the chief of police, seconded by Vice Mayor Bears.

1625
02:17:49,407 --> 02:17:50,047
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1626
02:17:50,187 --> 02:17:51,188
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1627
02:17:51,248 --> 02:17:51,968
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1628
02:17:52,709 --> 02:17:55,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Chief Buckley, thank you for being the last person standing.

1629
02:18:01,052 --> 02:18:05,375
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the Adam speaks for itself.

1630
02:18:05,415 --> 02:18:13,262
[SPEAKER_11]: So there was the 25 number unit of traffic supervisors, they negotiated in good faith with the city.

1631
02:18:13,282 --> 02:18:18,285
[SPEAKER_11]: They came to a memorandum of agreement on this contractual issue.

1632
02:18:18,306 --> 02:18:19,627
[SPEAKER_11]: This is where we stand today.

1633
02:18:20,407 --> 02:18:23,730
[SPEAKER_11]: I just presented before you for the approval.

1634
02:18:24,587 --> 02:18:33,652
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't answer the questions you have as it relates to that, but I also want to take the opportunity because I don't think it's said much about these employees that how much they're appreciated in this community.

1635
02:18:33,752 --> 02:18:40,615
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want, I mean, I think it's, they're out there, you know, throughout the school year for our children in the morning and afternoon.

1636
02:18:40,635 --> 02:18:46,258
[SPEAKER_11]: So they do a fantastic job in some sometimes really difficult situations, but otherwise also.

1637
02:18:46,338 --> 02:18:52,401
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just add that in support of having this passed for the contract.

1638
02:18:54,160 --> 02:18:54,801
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1639
02:18:55,321 --> 02:18:58,444
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank you chief for being here for so long.

1640
02:18:59,805 --> 02:19:07,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Just confirming that this has been agreed to by the every all parties have agreed to this agreement and that's why we came to an agreement at the table.

1641
02:19:08,333 --> 02:19:12,117
[SPEAKER_11]: We put the language together agreed to the language it's been ratified by the great perfect.

1642
02:19:12,457 --> 02:19:12,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1643
02:19:14,119 --> 02:19:18,123
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to approve the other discussion from the council or any members of the public.

1644
02:19:21,482 --> 02:19:27,322
[SPEAKER_08]: being a young father and having the opportunity to take my kids down to the public schools, my kids are at the Brooks.

1645
02:19:27,950 --> 02:19:31,833
[SPEAKER_08]: And just seeing the work and effort that they put in down there, they do an excellent job.

1646
02:19:31,873 --> 02:19:35,175
[SPEAKER_08]: These traffic supervisors are really underappreciated.

1647
02:19:35,895 --> 02:19:41,179
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing's worse than when one of them's out and they have a uniformed police officer doing the traffic detail down there.

1648
02:19:42,880 --> 02:19:47,203
[SPEAKER_08]: They have it down to a system that the traffic supervisors where it just flows amazing.

1649
02:19:47,683 --> 02:19:51,486
[SPEAKER_08]: And any disruption to that usually creates chaos down in the neighborhood.

1650
02:19:51,506 --> 02:19:52,827
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'd like to just thank the

1651
02:19:53,342 --> 02:19:58,986
[SPEAKER_08]: the traffic supervisors that we have here in the community for doing such a great job, because they are an underappreciated resource.

1652
02:19:59,446 --> 02:20:01,868
[SPEAKER_08]: They're the people that we trust in keeping our kids safe.

1653
02:20:02,548 --> 02:20:09,433
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen a number of tragic incidents over the years with traffic supervisors being assaulted, being yelled at, spit on, and the like.

1654
02:20:09,533 --> 02:20:14,056
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to just make sure that they recognize the value that they have in this community.

1655
02:20:15,236 --> 02:20:15,817
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1656
02:20:16,057 --> 02:20:20,580
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion on the motion to approve from Vice President Bears?

1657
02:20:22,485 --> 02:20:23,705
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to approve for first reading.

1658
02:20:29,347 --> 02:20:34,229
[SPEAKER_06]: It's retro back to July 1st, so yeah, it's a little while.

1659
02:20:34,269 --> 02:20:38,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be happy to amend my motion to approve and waive all future readings so that it doesn't move tonight.

1660
02:20:38,970 --> 02:20:42,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion on Vice President Bears to approve and waive all future readings as seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1661
02:20:42,852 --> 02:20:43,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1662
02:21:01,492 --> 02:21:09,659
[SPEAKER_11]: vice president bears.

1663
02:21:09,779 --> 02:21:10,839
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1664
02:21:11,080 --> 02:21:11,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1665
02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:11,960
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1666
02:21:11,980 --> 02:21:12,120
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1667
02:21:12,301 --> 02:21:12,761
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1668
02:21:12,881 --> 02:21:13,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1669
02:21:14,022 --> 02:21:14,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all appreciate it.

1670
02:21:15,163 --> 02:21:15,703
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks chief.

1671
02:21:17,404 --> 02:21:26,952
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to go back to regular business or regular order on the motion advice is embarrassed to revert to regular order of business seconded by Councilor Tseng all those in favor.

1672
02:21:27,912 --> 02:21:29,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Opposed motion passes.

1673
02:21:31,165 --> 02:21:33,386
[SPEAKER_15]: All right, 22-494.

1674
02:21:33,406 --> 02:21:48,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Be it resolved by the Medford City Council, the ordinances and rules subcommittee meet to discuss the creation of a budget needs assessment ordinance to provide accurate and actionable information on the city of Medford's operating and capital budget needs and the deficit between current revenues and needed expenditures.

1675
02:21:49,673 --> 02:21:50,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Bears.

1676
02:21:50,353 --> 02:21:51,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1677
02:21:54,134 --> 02:21:59,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's become very clear to all of us that the budget process and the information that's available to us

1678
02:22:00,717 --> 02:22:03,560
[SPEAKER_06]: and to the public during the budget process is insufficient.

1679
02:22:05,522 --> 02:22:14,972
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it took this Council coming together to figure out about the structural deficit and the ARPA question and the free cash question and the FY20.

1680
02:22:15,966 --> 02:22:16,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Curry budget.

1681
02:22:18,408 --> 02:22:26,536
[SPEAKER_06]: And really the other kind of outstanding question that we kind of have partial answers to but not complete answers to is what is our, you know, what is our capital backlog.

1682
02:22:26,996 --> 02:22:28,298
[SPEAKER_06]: What are our operating needs.

1683
02:22:29,018 --> 02:22:39,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of me putting this forward as I was reading in detail the comprehensive plan draft and I submitted comments, and, you know, there's a lot of great stuff in there.

1684
02:22:39,208 --> 02:22:41,250
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have the money for it.

1685
02:22:42,779 --> 02:22:45,201
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we should have is a plan to get there.

1686
02:22:45,641 --> 02:23:09,536
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think something that we can do as a council, while we can't change the budget process itself as that is outlined by state law, what we can do is add to it by making sure that the information that we need to make informed decisions and that residents need to make informed decisions is available to us so that I'll leave it there but the intent of this resolution is for our ordinances and rules subcommittee to meet.

1687
02:23:10,076 --> 02:23:16,722
[SPEAKER_06]: to draft a document that would allow us to, that would require that the city assesses operating and capital needs.

1688
02:23:18,423 --> 02:23:30,813
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we would have the information available to us about the difference between what we're currently spending, what we believe we need to spend, and then that obviously would give us the answer on what kind of revenue we need to raise through the many tools that are available to us.

1689
02:23:30,914 --> 02:23:31,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1690
02:23:32,815 --> 02:23:34,917
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, President Reyes, Councilor Collins, and Councilor Tseng.

1691
02:23:36,696 --> 02:23:37,637
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Morell.

1692
02:23:37,997 --> 02:23:40,499
[SPEAKER_23]: And I thank Vice President Bears for putting this forward tonight.

1693
02:23:40,519 --> 02:23:58,151
[SPEAKER_23]: You know, the council is expected and empowered to provide financial oversight for the city, sign off on major contracts, transactions, appropriations, but there isn't any sort of binding or consistent structure for what kind of information we are to be basing these decisions on.

1694
02:23:59,913 --> 02:24:02,495
[SPEAKER_23]: Putting these needs and expectations on the books as an ordinance.

1695
02:24:03,837 --> 02:24:12,744
[SPEAKER_23]: that could help enforce that the council actually gets the relevant information and on a timely schedule that we need to make these major decisions.

1696
02:24:13,685 --> 02:24:16,847
[SPEAKER_23]: The only body in the city government that gets to sign off on these major decisions.

1697
02:24:17,528 --> 02:24:23,873
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that could help enshrine more of the transparency and accountability that our constituents expect of us.

1698
02:24:23,953 --> 02:24:26,415
[SPEAKER_23]: And I appreciate you bringing up the comprehensive plan.

1699
02:24:26,435 --> 02:24:30,518
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that applies to all of the, you know, I've said it before, we're very, very rich in plans.

1700
02:24:31,879 --> 02:24:32,360
[SPEAKER_23]: We need,

1701
02:24:33,511 --> 02:24:40,052
[SPEAKER_23]: some sort of accountability structure so that we can navigate towards them and not just say, well, how do we end up here?

1702
02:24:41,393 --> 02:24:43,713
[SPEAKER_23]: And just navigate from that point year by year forever.

1703
02:24:44,233 --> 02:24:44,553
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1704
02:24:44,573 --> 02:24:46,294
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1705
02:24:46,314 --> 02:24:48,314
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tsai.

1706
02:24:48,374 --> 02:24:50,655
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I thank Vice President Barrios for introducing this.

1707
02:24:51,695 --> 02:24:55,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Two terms come to mind when I think about this.

1708
02:24:55,515 --> 02:24:59,416
[SPEAKER_02]: The first is fiscal sense or fiscal responsibility, and the second is transparency.

1709
02:25:00,196 --> 02:25:02,257
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to fiscal sense, I think,

1710
02:25:02,897 --> 02:25:28,183
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we we need ours as a city we need a long term plan, we need to know what investments were making, and it's the most fiscally responsible thing we can do isn't to pass on problems for say we can't afford it, but but is to create a plan to afford the needs that we have in this community, and that starts by identifying the needs that are our budget needs and the deficit and understanding the deficit.

1711
02:25:30,211 --> 02:25:35,213
[SPEAKER_02]: When it comes to transparency, this not only helps us Councilors, it helps residents in the city.

1712
02:25:35,713 --> 02:25:49,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it leads us to a point where we are better informed going into the budget process, where residents are better informed going into the budget process, and where we don't feel like we're being hoodwinked or cornered at the last minute.

1713
02:25:49,657 --> 02:25:52,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1714
02:25:52,658 --> 02:25:53,439
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

1715
02:25:55,419 --> 02:25:59,301
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Bearsar, seconded by Councilor Caraviellola.

1716
02:25:59,341 --> 02:25:59,901
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

1717
02:26:00,646 --> 02:26:02,067
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed, motion passes.

1718
02:26:02,087 --> 02:26:13,092
[SPEAKER_15]: 22-495 offered by vices and bears, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the city administration provide an update on all pilot agreements entered into by the city of Medford and the status of all pilot agreement negotiations.

1719
02:26:13,172 --> 02:26:13,912
[SPEAKER_15]: Vices and bears.

1720
02:26:14,012 --> 02:26:14,913
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1721
02:26:15,333 --> 02:26:17,314
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't heard about pilots in a while.

1722
02:26:17,334 --> 02:26:29,260
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that some of our pilot institutions were maybe friendly to us during the pandemic, and maybe we decided to back off a little bit.

1723
02:26:31,061 --> 02:26:42,147
[SPEAKER_06]: I probably wouldn't have done it but, you know, these are large institutions that are entered into agreements with the city to provide funding to the community in lieu of the property taxes that they would otherwise pay.

1724
02:26:43,268 --> 02:26:46,950
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a significant source of revenue to the community.

1725
02:26:48,391 --> 02:26:52,113
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like to get an update on where we are with all of those I do know that

1726
02:26:52,692 --> 02:26:58,334
[SPEAKER_06]: At last update Harvard Vanguard across the street had used to pay a pilot payment and they just voluntarily kind of stopped doing that.

1727
02:26:58,754 --> 02:27:09,137
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right across the street, takes up a lot of land right in our valuable Medford Square has a parking garage that they don't allow the public to access that could benefit our parking needs.

1728
02:27:09,277 --> 02:27:19,359
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's just one of the several agreements or past agreements that I'd like to know if the city is still pursuing or engaging the stakeholders with.

1729
02:27:19,499 --> 02:27:19,799
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1730
02:27:22,902 --> 02:27:23,763
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Morell.

1731
02:27:24,763 --> 02:27:37,952
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, I think reviewing our pilot agreements, the status of our pilot negotiations should be a routine procedure, especially after the budget season that we just went through, knowing that the belt is already pulled so tight or our budget is so austere already.

1732
02:27:39,373 --> 02:27:52,122
[SPEAKER_23]: It's as crucial as it has ever been to make sure that our pilot agreements with our large institutional members are fair, holding these institutions accountable to paying their fair share, just like all other Medford residents do.

1733
02:27:53,736 --> 02:27:54,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tseng?

1734
02:27:54,576 --> 02:27:59,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think the two councilors said it well, this is about institutions playing their fair share.

1735
02:27:59,979 --> 02:28:14,386
[SPEAKER_02]: You might hear a lot about institutions doing this project or that project, and it is great for a community, but we are also at a point where a better pilot agreement, better, a fairer agreement would actually benefit our city much more.

1736
02:28:15,467 --> 02:28:16,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1737
02:28:16,347 --> 02:28:17,108
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

1738
02:28:19,189 --> 02:28:21,250
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of President Bearsar, is it seconded by

1739
02:28:23,014 --> 02:28:24,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Collins, all those in favor?

1740
02:28:24,556 --> 02:28:26,378
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1741
02:28:26,758 --> 02:28:33,886
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1742
02:28:33,906 --> 02:28:40,574
[SPEAKER_15]: 22-496 offered by vices and bears be resolved by the Metro City Council that we meet in committee of the whole to review the draft Medford comprehensive plan, vices and bears.

1743
02:28:41,708 --> 02:28:43,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President, speaks for itself.

1744
02:28:44,752 --> 02:28:54,603
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that the public comment period on the initial draft just ended, so I'd be open to doing something sooner or later, depending on what we decide and what our schedule allows, but I do think we should take a look at this at some point.

1745
02:28:55,444 --> 02:28:55,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1746
02:28:59,905 --> 02:29:03,306
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor.

1747
02:29:03,326 --> 02:29:04,326
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

1748
02:29:04,386 --> 02:29:04,927
[SPEAKER_15]: Opposed.

1749
02:29:05,427 --> 02:29:07,728
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1750
02:29:07,748 --> 02:29:15,810
[SPEAKER_15]: 22-497 offered by Vice President Bears, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that the Zoning Board of Appeals provide all materials relative to decisions A-2017-30 through A-2017-40.

1751
02:29:19,203 --> 02:29:34,077
[SPEAKER_15]: 2017-42 and A-2018-20 to the Community Development Board relative to the two to four Capen Street and 50 Winthrop Street site plan reviews to ensure that all conditions applied to previous projects are maintained or expanded for these two proposals.

1752
02:29:34,197 --> 02:29:34,918
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Bears.

1753
02:29:35,118 --> 02:29:35,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1754
02:29:35,959 --> 02:29:43,386
[SPEAKER_06]: The Community Development Board is considering under our new zoning ordinance that this council passed after 18 months of diligent exceptional work.

1755
02:29:45,367 --> 02:29:48,188
[SPEAKER_06]: under the Dover amendment site plan review process.

1756
02:29:48,948 --> 02:30:01,712
[SPEAKER_06]: These projects two to four Capen street and 50 Winston street would be taking down existing more common single multifamily residential structures and building a larger multi-unit buildings.

1757
02:30:01,772 --> 02:30:02,713
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not opposed to that.

1758
02:30:02,853 --> 02:30:09,235
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Tufts should and must do more to house students on campus to prevent the displacement of residents in the surrounding neighborhoods.

1759
02:30:09,915 --> 02:30:11,376
[SPEAKER_06]: However, there were a number of conditions.

1760
02:30:11,396 --> 02:30:16,259
[SPEAKER_06]: This is on Capen Street, we've heard of Coho Community Housing, we've heard of the Capen area.

1761
02:30:16,939 --> 02:30:35,590
[SPEAKER_06]: There were multiple decisions by the ZBA under previous processes in 2017 and 2018 that put multiple conditions on those projects and I want to make sure that the Community Development Board, who is now kind of taking over from the ZBA on reviewing these projects, at least to start, has that information before them as they review these projects in October.

1762
02:30:37,525 --> 02:30:37,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1763
02:30:38,085 --> 02:30:38,306
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1764
02:30:38,606 --> 02:30:39,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

1765
02:30:40,748 --> 02:30:43,630
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Vice President Bear is a second by Councilor Scarpelli.

1766
02:30:44,311 --> 02:30:44,991
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favour?

1767
02:30:45,732 --> 02:30:46,573
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

1768
02:30:47,053 --> 02:30:47,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion passes.

1769
02:30:47,734 --> 02:30:52,398
[SPEAKER_15]: 22-498 offered by Councilor Collins and Councilor Tseng.

1770
02:30:53,455 --> 02:30:59,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas the American Cancer Fund for Children and Kids Cancer Connection report, cancer is the leading cause of death by disease among U.S.

1771
02:30:59,382 --> 02:31:00,703
[SPEAKER_15]: children between infancy and age 15.

1772
02:31:00,924 --> 02:31:06,270
[SPEAKER_15]: This tragic disease is detected in more than 16,000 of our country's young people every year.

1773
02:31:06,650 --> 02:31:10,735
[SPEAKER_15]: An estimated 400,000 children and adolescents are diagnosed with cancer globally each year.

1774
02:31:11,295 --> 02:31:32,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Whereas one in five of our nation's children loses his or her battle with cancer, and many children will suffer from long term effects of comprehensive treatment including secondary cancers, whereas the American Cancer Fund for Children and Kids Cancer Connection provides a variety of vital patient psychosocial services to children undergoing cancer treatment at Boston Children's Hospital, Tufts Children's Hospital, Shriners Children's Boston, Dana-Farber Children's Cancer Center,

1775
02:31:33,372 --> 02:31:49,542
[SPEAKER_15]: Mass General Hospital for Children as well as participating hospitals throughout the country, thereby enhancing the quality of life for these children and their families, whereas the American Cancer Fund for Children and Kids Cancer Connection also sponsored toy distributions, Laughter Noon, Laughter is Healing, positive appearance programs, pet assisted therapy,

1776
02:31:49,986 --> 02:32:06,101
[SPEAKER_15]: KCC Supercar Experience, educational programs, and hospital celebrations in honor of a child's determination and bravery to fight the battle against childhood cancer, be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize September as Childhood Cancer Awareness Month in Medford, and thank the American Cancer Fund for Children and Kids Cancer Connection for their service.

1777
02:32:06,882 --> 02:32:07,443
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Collins.

1778
02:32:08,697 --> 02:32:11,358
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you President Morell for reading out the entire resolution.

1779
02:32:12,659 --> 02:32:18,762
[SPEAKER_23]: The city council was contacted by the directors of the Kids Cancer Connection and the American Cancer Fund for Children.

1780
02:32:19,763 --> 02:32:27,927
[SPEAKER_23]: And so I was happy to put forth this resolution on the request and elevate the issue of cancer, affecting children I think this resolution.

1781
02:32:28,747 --> 02:32:37,814
[SPEAKER_23]: spells out the sad facts of the prevalence of this disease on this young population all across our nation and here in Medford as well.

1782
02:32:39,735 --> 02:32:58,369
[SPEAKER_23]: So I asked for my fellow Councilors support in the statement and saying that our hearts go out to all the children and families affected by this difficult illness and that we applaud all the children and families going through this hardship and all the healthcare workers and caregivers who help heal these children and also help provide moments of joy and relief.

1783
02:32:59,163 --> 02:32:59,623
[SPEAKER_23]: in this moment.

1784
02:33:00,004 --> 02:33:01,245
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1785
02:33:01,665 --> 02:33:03,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins put it really well.

1786
02:33:03,246 --> 02:33:08,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this is a motion of, um, recognition of thanks of gratitude.

1787
02:33:08,650 --> 02:33:20,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think this is particularly, um, I think meaningful to Medford because I know a lot of my friends and people young young folks in Medford know of a friend or a family member who has passed or is, um,

1788
02:33:21,997 --> 02:33:23,980
[SPEAKER_02]: is dealing with childhood cancer.

1789
02:33:24,660 --> 02:33:32,249
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also particularly meaningful with the president's trip into Boston yesterday, where he made a speech about investing in cancer solutions.

1790
02:33:32,850 --> 02:33:36,014
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the right time to put a spotlight on this.

1791
02:33:36,054 --> 02:33:36,915
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

1792
02:33:37,648 --> 02:33:38,329
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1793
02:33:38,449 --> 02:33:39,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further, Councilor Caraviello?

1794
02:33:40,030 --> 02:33:40,711
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Madam President.

1795
02:33:40,791 --> 02:33:43,112
[SPEAKER_25]: And I thank my fellow council for this moment.

1796
02:33:43,132 --> 02:33:44,954
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, I'm fortunate.

1797
02:33:45,474 --> 02:33:49,037
[SPEAKER_25]: I work in an organization that we work with the Tufts Children's Hospital.

1798
02:33:49,117 --> 02:33:56,383
[SPEAKER_25]: And one of the issues we're having over there now is they're going over to Children's Hospital, taking them over.

1799
02:33:56,864 --> 02:34:01,047
[SPEAKER_25]: And there's certain departments that Tufts is going to lose in that.

1800
02:34:01,067 --> 02:34:06,051
[SPEAKER_25]: But, you know, children suffering with cancer are always a serious problem.

1801
02:34:07,729 --> 02:34:16,215
[SPEAKER_25]: People who have healthy children don't realize how fortunate they are when you actually go into these facilities and see these kids and your heart really breaks for them.

1802
02:34:16,255 --> 02:34:19,157
[SPEAKER_25]: So I support this 100%.

1803
02:34:19,277 --> 02:34:20,978
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1804
02:34:20,998 --> 02:34:22,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice-President Bears.

1805
02:34:22,579 --> 02:34:23,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1806
02:34:23,860 --> 02:34:28,163
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate the words of all my fellow councilors.

1807
02:34:28,263 --> 02:34:33,607
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had a cousin who got leukemia age five years old.

1808
02:34:34,658 --> 02:34:38,322
[SPEAKER_06]: and survived, luckily, thankfully, to the great treatment at Children's Hospital.

1809
02:34:39,724 --> 02:34:50,417
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit of a turn, but another piece of this that I think I'm really, you know, I was at a public meeting last night talking about Life Science Park down on Mystic Avenue.

1810
02:34:51,018 --> 02:34:53,280
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like to think that maybe through our work,

1811
02:34:53,960 --> 02:35:03,290
[SPEAKER_06]: We can bring more of that those jobs and that research here to Medford and make an impact and then, you know, an additional Councilor Tseng said about the President's visit.

1812
02:35:04,130 --> 02:35:04,891
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a coalition.

1813
02:35:05,820 --> 02:35:26,715
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, not all the partners that you'd think of me bringing up traditionally, like big hospitals and big companies, but you know, it's called the Charm Coalition and its goal is to bring the advanced research projects agencies for health here to Boston, bring a lot of federal money here and really boost up even more the life science work and health work that's happening in the community.

1814
02:35:26,775 --> 02:35:31,298
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe on a future agenda, we can support that effort as well.

1815
02:35:31,378 --> 02:35:34,500
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to say, you know, if this, you know,

1816
02:35:35,034 --> 02:35:45,078
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to come through our plan community development district or commercial development district project process but I'm excited to see like cutting edge life sciences that could help address this problem here in Medford, I think that's.

1817
02:35:46,238 --> 02:35:46,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1818
02:35:47,779 --> 02:35:50,419
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1819
02:35:50,439 --> 02:35:56,782
[SPEAKER_25]: People forget, you know, how fortunate we are to be in an area that has all these facilities.

1820
02:35:57,728 --> 02:35:59,308
[SPEAKER_25]: but for children.

1821
02:35:59,648 --> 02:36:07,170
[SPEAKER_25]: So we have to consider ourselves lucky that we live in this area, and these are available to us.

1822
02:36:09,811 --> 02:36:13,672
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate Councilor Collins, Councilor Tseng bringing this forward.

1823
02:36:13,692 --> 02:36:18,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that, you know, until it happens, until you know someone, it really doesn't hit you.

1824
02:36:18,493 --> 02:36:26,295
[SPEAKER_03]: And just recently we had a young man that grew up on Almond Street, a prestigious athlete,

1825
02:36:26,823 --> 02:36:40,735
[SPEAKER_03]: going off to play football in college, everything going right in his life, and felt something on his face at an all-star football game, and told his brother, that's a teacher at Medford High School, and said, let's feel some pain.

1826
02:36:41,676 --> 02:36:47,581
[SPEAKER_03]: And we quickly, the family had quick resources that they took him over to the doctors.

1827
02:36:47,682 --> 02:36:49,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Right away, they sent him to Dana-Farber.

1828
02:36:49,844 --> 02:36:51,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, he found that it was lymphoma.

1829
02:36:54,178 --> 02:37:07,706
[SPEAKER_03]: with the grace of God and the process that his family went through and having Dana Faber in the backyard, they got to it right away and the diagnosis and the surgery went well and everything looks positive in this young man's life.

1830
02:37:07,746 --> 02:37:14,991
[SPEAKER_03]: So until you see it, but you have to realize it, it's happening to the person right next door.

1831
02:37:15,911 --> 02:37:17,853
[SPEAKER_03]: And to see the movement that,

1832
02:37:18,785 --> 02:37:20,807
[SPEAKER_03]: we can make here in Medford.

1833
02:37:21,268 --> 02:37:33,381
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exciting and it's a way that we can have just a little piece that we can support and move this horrible disease out of here.

1834
02:37:33,841 --> 02:37:34,442
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

1835
02:37:34,790 --> 02:37:38,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, and I wanna thank my fellow councilors for bringing this forward and their words on it.

1836
02:37:39,053 --> 02:37:52,703
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's been mentioned that we absolutely do have the best care centers in the country, some of the best in the world for this disease, but pediatric cancer is actually chronically underfunded, unfunded.

1837
02:37:52,723 --> 02:37:58,368
[SPEAKER_15]: It just looked up about 4%, only 4% of federal research dollars on cancer go towards pediatric cancer studies.

1838
02:37:58,408 --> 02:38:03,812
[SPEAKER_15]: So I really appreciate you both for bringing this forward and raising this issue, because as Councilor Scarpelli said, it's something that,

1839
02:38:04,632 --> 02:38:09,176
[SPEAKER_15]: We're fortunate if we have healthy children and we don't think about it too deeply until it comes into your world.

1840
02:38:09,276 --> 02:38:13,179
[SPEAKER_15]: So advocating for this care and also advocating for the research.

1841
02:38:13,259 --> 02:38:15,921
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you both for bringing that forward and for everyone's comments.

1842
02:38:16,001 --> 02:38:20,545
[SPEAKER_15]: And I do see the hand raise from Mr. Castagnetti.

1843
02:38:21,706 --> 02:38:22,787
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address for the record, please.

1844
02:38:25,749 --> 02:38:28,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Hand raise from Mr. Castagnetti.

1845
02:38:28,591 --> 02:38:30,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

1846
02:38:33,303 --> 02:38:36,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you hear me?

1847
02:38:36,484 --> 02:38:43,326
[SPEAKER_15]: You're going to mute me for a second if you can turn off.

1848
02:38:43,587 --> 02:38:44,827
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you're watching on the TV.

1849
02:38:44,847 --> 02:38:46,308
[SPEAKER_15]: We're getting like a feedback loop.

1850
02:38:47,488 --> 02:38:50,869
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you could just mute whatever you're watching it on that might be delayed.

1851
02:38:50,889 --> 02:38:53,850
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello.

1852
02:38:54,991 --> 02:38:55,771
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, we can hear you now.

1853
02:38:55,931 --> 02:38:56,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds clear.

1854
02:39:05,792 --> 02:39:07,713
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Angel Castagnetti, Cushman Street.

1855
02:39:08,093 --> 02:39:15,378
[SPEAKER_22]: Just wanted to say I wish your president lots of good luck and Godspeed and his quest to cure cancer.

1856
02:39:15,938 --> 02:39:17,699
[SPEAKER_22]: We could all use some help in that area.

1857
02:39:17,979 --> 02:39:18,800
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you very much.

1858
02:39:18,820 --> 02:39:21,041
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1859
02:39:22,322 --> 02:39:25,965
[SPEAKER_15]: So on the motion of Councilor Tseng and Councilor Collins as seconded by

1860
02:39:27,329 --> 02:39:28,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Caraviello all those in favor.

1861
02:39:28,671 --> 02:39:46,573
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed motion passes to 2-499 offered by Councilor Collins, be it resolved that the Metro City Council requested the administration review and update the COVID-19 information currently published on the city website, including information on new booster shots the suspension of the USPS free test kit program.

1862
02:39:47,122 --> 02:39:55,849
[SPEAKER_15]: sites where sites where tests, masks, and PPE may be obtained for free in Medford, updating COVID-19 mask mandate information and FAQs and current case counts.

1863
02:39:56,249 --> 02:40:11,440
[SPEAKER_15]: We have further resolved that the Medford City Council requests an update from the Board of Health on the state administration's offer of a free at-home COVID-19 test, mask, and other PPE to interested municipalities if the Board of Health has applied or plans to apply, and when and where these items will be available for residents.

1864
02:40:11,480 --> 02:40:12,141
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Collins.

1865
02:40:12,895 --> 02:40:29,318
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you President real and actually just earlier this afternoon I heard back from director O'Connor with an update about reviewing and updating the coven 19 information on the city website so it appears that as of today a lot of that information about the coven 19 resources that are available to Medford residents.

1866
02:40:30,198 --> 02:40:43,863
[SPEAKER_23]: the status of health orders, the new boosters, the ending of the USPS free test kit supply, the revocation of the mask mandates, that's all been updated to no longer display updated information, which is great.

1867
02:40:44,803 --> 02:40:48,304
[SPEAKER_23]: Very grateful to Director O'Connor and her staff for their quick work on that.

1868
02:40:48,745 --> 02:40:57,988
[SPEAKER_23]: And she also let me know that she is indeed already in contact with the State Department of Public Health on how to secure more of those test kits from the state's most recent offer.

1869
02:40:58,628 --> 02:41:10,797
[SPEAKER_23]: of free ones to municipalities that could augment the tests that the Board of Health is already distributing at City Hall, the West Medford Community Center, Medford Housing Authority, the library, and the Council on Aging.

1870
02:41:12,499 --> 02:41:16,402
[SPEAKER_23]: The second point that I wanted to make with this resolution which has nothing at all to do with the Board of Health.

1871
02:41:17,383 --> 02:41:22,907
[SPEAKER_23]: I just think that it has to be said again that the city website remains in very dire need of an overhaul.

1872
02:41:23,567 --> 02:41:40,237
[SPEAKER_23]: and it's not just so that updates and new information may be added in a timely way, but also so that the city website can be simply readable and legible and navigable and looks like the professional website that one would expect to exist for a city of 60,000 people.

1873
02:41:40,777 --> 02:41:45,140
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't mention that as, I feel uncomfortable mentioning that because it's not a dig at any

1874
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:47,341
[SPEAKER_23]: city staff worker or any department.

1875
02:41:48,561 --> 02:41:54,924
[SPEAKER_23]: This is just one of the many things that falls by the wayside when the city lacks the capacity to fully implement its projects, any project.

1876
02:41:55,725 --> 02:42:06,390
[SPEAKER_23]: And I think that's one of the many reasons that we need to keep up the drumbeat about municipal resources, because the lack of resources, the lack of bandwidth that translates into residents not having the services they deserve.

1877
02:42:07,050 --> 02:42:09,852
[SPEAKER_23]: And that includes a website that remains untranslated.

1878
02:42:10,412 --> 02:42:12,693
[SPEAKER_23]: And frankly, even for me,

1879
02:42:13,229 --> 02:42:16,712
[SPEAKER_23]: is frankly hard to read and hard to navigate and hard to find information on.

1880
02:42:17,013 --> 02:42:17,333
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1881
02:42:17,893 --> 02:42:18,694
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1882
02:42:18,834 --> 02:42:19,475
[SPEAKER_15]: Vice Chair Bares.

1883
02:42:20,576 --> 02:42:24,259
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President, I won't belabor it too much but Councilor Collins is right on point.

1884
02:42:24,440 --> 02:42:27,623
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, these are key issues and should be updated.

1885
02:42:28,423 --> 02:42:32,327
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, we have a real issue.

1886
02:42:32,347 --> 02:42:36,371
[SPEAKER_06]: It goes back to what we're talking about around the solid waste task force as well.

1887
02:42:37,702 --> 02:42:55,642
[SPEAKER_06]: We, not only do we have one director of communications and I know there's a posting for a temporary COVID communication director but that's not an excuse to not have things updated, and a director of constituent services, but it seems to me that when the planning and development department is doing a solid waste task force, they're out on their

1888
02:42:56,653 --> 02:43:00,255
[SPEAKER_06]: to do the outreach and the communication and the constituent services.

1889
02:43:00,315 --> 02:43:06,338
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a director of communications and director of constituent services who work for the mayor, but do they work for the departments?

1890
02:43:06,398 --> 02:43:08,619
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a department of communications.

1891
02:43:08,639 --> 02:43:10,500
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a department of constituent services.

1892
02:43:10,540 --> 02:43:15,442
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have an established group of people with the actual resources and time.

1893
02:43:16,203 --> 02:43:23,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I can respect director Hunt when she says all of us are salaried, none of us are hourly and we're volunteering to go out to what we can go out to.

1894
02:43:24,716 --> 02:43:37,139
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because we haven't dedicated the resources necessary to have a centralized department that assists all of the other departments in doing outreach and translation and website updates and email communications.

1895
02:43:37,579 --> 02:43:46,040
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, to me, when I hear Director Hunt say we have 1,700 people on our newsletter, that's a success, but it's also like, but what about the mayor's newsletter?

1896
02:43:46,140 --> 02:43:52,762
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are we asking each department to come up with their own list and reduplicate all of the effort of collecting people and getting them on the outreach?

1897
02:43:54,065 --> 02:44:03,409
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I said I wasn't going to belabor it and I belabored it but it's it's just like planning and coordination, and a little bit of resources will go a long way.

1898
02:44:03,869 --> 02:44:04,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1899
02:44:06,721 --> 02:44:08,682
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I'm Councilor bears and vice president mirrors.

1900
02:44:09,683 --> 02:44:30,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So get columns and vice president bears have have really have covered the most important points I mean it really shouldn't take this council badgering away at updates for on the web on the city website for him constituents emailing us all the time for updates I mean, these are things that we really should have department for some investment and resources for on.

1901
02:44:32,218 --> 02:44:38,403
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we passed a similar, less comprehensive, I will say, but similar resolution a few months ago, and we're back here again.

1902
02:44:38,763 --> 02:44:42,246
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's honestly, we don't, this doesn't need to happen.

1903
02:44:42,266 --> 02:44:44,368
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1904
02:44:44,408 --> 02:44:45,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Any further discussion?

1905
02:44:46,630 --> 02:44:48,951
[SPEAKER_15]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by

1906
02:44:50,488 --> 02:44:51,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

1911
02:45:05,925 --> 02:45:07,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, sorry.

1912
02:45:07,406 --> 02:45:12,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've already had a conversation about this, I won't go on too long of a tangent about this.

1913
02:45:12,667 --> 02:45:19,749
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about the need for the data that our city uses and reports to be more specific.

1914
02:45:20,669 --> 02:45:27,951
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll help us when it comes to, in the fiscal sense, when it comes to targeting resources, which we already know as a city, we're cash strapped.

1915
02:45:28,871 --> 02:45:31,712
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll also help us understand our own community better.

1916
02:45:32,732 --> 02:45:33,373
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

1917
02:45:33,433 --> 02:45:34,113

1924
02:45:46,868 --> 02:45:51,150
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak for public participation who did not get to speak earlier?
