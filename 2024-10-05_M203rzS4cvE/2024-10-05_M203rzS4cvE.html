Hassett Drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=261.644s">Go</a>  ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=262.464s">I</a>  would like to start with thanking the council for giving us a chance to explain our situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=268.767s">We</a>  have been without a contract for three and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=273.98s">There's</a>  been no increase, there's been discussions, and everything has been shot down. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=279.905s">While</a>  the cost of living has gone up over 8%, we're asking for these raises in order to survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=288.352s">The</a>  cost of living in Massachusetts has skyrocketed, and every time we've gone in front of anybody to ask for a raise, we were told that we would bankrupt the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=298.772s">With</a>  the rising costs of housing, utilities, gas, food, and medicine, it's making it impossible for us to survive on the wages that we're making. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=308.939s">Currently</a>  we are the lowest paid clerks in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=313.622s">During</a>  coven we were the ones that kept the city running. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=319.663s">The</a>  city and surrounding cities shut down, but yet there were departments that made it mandatory that the clerks come in while everybody else worked from home. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=330.431s">The</a>  clerks within the city clerk's office showed up for work every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=335.054s">They</a>  were made to wear masks and gloves. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=337.476s">They</a>  had to go out to cars that were parked outside and collect their applications, whether it be for marriage <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=344.368s">death</a>  certificates birth certificates business licenses, and due to the closures of all the other cities, they were had to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=353.354s">They</a>  had to take in marriage licenses from several surrounding cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=359.018s">The</a>  tax collector's office, obviously had to stay open and make sure all the taxes were paid the water bills were collected the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=368.657s">started</a>  an online permitting system to make sure that all permits were applied for were issued, and the money deposited. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=376.883s">Morale</a>  is absolutely non-existent with the secretaries clerks within City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=384.309s">We</a>  have been disrespected, overlooked, neglected, and underappreciated for several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=393.154s">We're</a>  starting to wonder now if it's that we're just considered secretaries, or is it because we're women? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=402.382s">Everyone</a>  around us has received raises, stipends, increased sick time, but when it comes to us, we get nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=412.577s">We</a>  currently have five clerks that are the lowest classification within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=417.799s">We</a>  have senior clerks that need reclassification to the next step of principal Clark. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=424.283s">The</a>  difference between pay would be $49 a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=428.453s">The</a>  total would be $12,740, and they still won't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=434.534s">They</a>  have created though several new positions and a new department, which budget has increased from 300, it's increased over 350,000, which you gentlemen and ladies have approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=450.897s">It's</a>  time that we have our departments reclassified. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=455.375s">We</a>  never get any answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=457.436s">We</a>  always get lots of excuses. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=460.617s">They</a>  can't meet with the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=462.878s">They</a>  had no time to meet with the administration, constantly canceling negotiations that they have with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=471.022s">They</a>  are very proud telling us that they have given us Juneteenth off and have put it in, that they're willing to sign that into our contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=479.405s">But</a>  everybody gets that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=481.406s">That</a>  it's not that they're giving it into us. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=483.987s">Everybody</a>  gets that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=487.128s">When</a>  we gave our first initial proposal, we were told that the next meeting we had, they would have answers to all our proposals and they would have a set of their own. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=496.475s">They</a>  came back rejecting the majority of our proposals and they had nothing to offer us, nothing at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=503.741s">We're</a>  tired of being treated less than team players where we have proven time and again that we are dedicated employees to this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=514.449s">We</a>  demand respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=517.0s">the</a>  respect that is shown to management and our male counterparts. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=522.704s">And</a>  on the last note, I have been here and I have been an employee of the city of Medford for 22 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=529.908s">I</a>  sat down, did the math and figured out for 22 years, I have gotten a raise of 74 cents an hour extra. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=540.074s">How</a>  you expect people to survive on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=542.996s">There's</a>  no way, there's no way. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=546.622s">We</a>  need something done and we need it done now. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=549.945s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=551.206s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=568.38s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=569.962s">Any</a>  councilors like to speak?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=573.124s">Madam</a>  President, if you may. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=573.905s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=575.694s">I</a>  think this administration's been very clear about its approach to labor relations in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=584.062s">Quite</a>  frankly, we've seen personnel turnover, more frequently than the rooms at the Hyatt across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=590.388s">All</a>  right, there's a human resource nightmare going on here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=593.611s">It's</a>  an absolute nightmare. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=602.722s">A</a>  couple months ago, we had a representative from local 25 here before us that showed us a package of 40 somewhat various labor charges, grievances, lawsuits that are pending before the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=616.889s">So</a>  it brought to my attention that yet another employee has been removed from city hall by escort. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=624.773s">That's</a>  not the way you treat employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=627.374s">If</a>  you respect your employees, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=629.438s">You</a>  work with them, not against them. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=631.118s">And</a>  I feel as though this administration has worked against a lot of the employees in this community as of recent. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=640.101s">How</a>  much money did they spend investigating rumors on a DPW employee? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=645.342s">How</a>  much money we've spent reinvestigating and rehashing the Brady List issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=650.823s">On</a>  and on again, it's more about press releases than results. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=654.044s">On</a>  and on again, it seems to me that the work that you people do is not respected. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=659.063s">On</a>  and on again, it seems to me that three years without a raise, three and a half years without a raise, while other bargaining units are settling and getting raises, tells us something. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=669.042s">It</a>  tells us something, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=671.773s">I</a>  appreciate the work that you guys do Amy, I worked with you, I was a bargaining rep for your union at one point in time, I think I did better than 74 cents an hour to I hope Jesus.</p>

    <p>[Amy Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=681.4s">But</a>  that's an average.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=683.522s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=685.744s">So,</a>  in looking at this and the approach that's going forward I mean ultimately the city council doesn't have the ability to tell the mayor to give you more money, but we can stand with you in lockstep and say that this is a good fight.</p>

    <p>[Amy Tenaglia]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=696.672s">I</a>  want everybody out there to know what is actually being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=699.513s">I</a>  mean, we sit here day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=702.834s">Regardless</a>  of who the mayor is at any point in time, we are dedicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=707.235s">We're</a>  dedicated to our jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=708.735s">We're</a>  dedicated to the city.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=710.115s">And</a>  I don't think you have the luxury of closing your door and telling people that you're too busy to meet with them either. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=717.597s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=718.477s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=718.957s">When</a>  the general public walks in off the street, you guys don't have the ability to turn them away. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=723.158s">But</a>  when you guys have concerns and issues that you want to address, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=726.267s">The</a>  door's not open for you to address those issues and concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=729.208s">I,</a>  as one Councilor, appreciate the work you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=730.908s">I</a>  know that the city's only as successful as the work that you do and the commitment that you have to being a part of this team. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=735.79s">It's</a>  a two-way street, and the administration has to show some of that respect and responsibility as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=742.632s">Moving</a>  forward, I certainly would never, ever, ever stand in the way of a contract race, a negotiated contract race that the union and the administration have been able to work out. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=753.756s">But</a>  it seems to me that right now negotiation is not the approach administration wants to take we're seeing what's going on at the school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=759.902s">My</a>  teachers have been the impasse has been declared and the teachers contracts negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=764.707s">That's</a>  one of the larger bargaining units that we have here in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=774.93s">The</a>  work in this community that, you know, I send my two children to the public schools that sit there with these public employees for more hours of the day than they spend with me awake, right, when you think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=786.256s">So</a>  the investment that we're making in our employees here, the investment that we're making in retention of those employees that have that institutional knowledge is laughable. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=796.262s">We're</a>  losing good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=798.103s">More</a>  and more, we're seeing good people being walked out the door. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=801.404s">More</a>  and more, we're seeing good people saying, I've had enough, I can't take it anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=805.123s">And</a>  they're moving on. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=806.583s">And</a>  the only people that are suffering because of that are the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=812.645s">I</a>  appreciate you guys in the fight that you're putting up. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=815.806s">It's</a>  a good fight, it's a fight worth fighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=818.066s">And</a>  I'll stand with you every step of the way to ensure that the administration takes the appropriate steps to show value for the work that you do.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=834.893s">Uh,</a>  thank you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=836.415s">And,</a>  uh, Council nights, uh, you know, comments, uh, I think, uh, hit it right on target. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=844.483s">I</a>  think that, uh, what we see is over and over again, the most important people in our community, the people that make our community run are the ones that are being neglected. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=857.396s">And,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=858.938s">When</a>  you're talking to our brothers and sisters that are teachers or brother and sister firefighters or our secretarial staff or other departments that that are crying out and saying how do we, how do we survive. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=876.788s">hasn't</a>  met with administration, hasn't tried to figure out strategic processes and try to figure out a way that we can get to a reasonable percentage raise. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=890.656s">When</a>  we're told we talk to people and try to get more invested, it's a personnel matter, which we know, but when it's phone call after phone call and person after person and family after family that are being affected, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=903.97s">It's</a>  alarming and it's alarming to the point where we're seeing good people walk out the door, whether on their own or with assistance or whether it's teachers that are qualified and our kids love and making impacts and moving to different communities or whether it's firefighters or police officers leaving to go to different communities or our secretarial staff leaving because it's just not worth working. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=930.487s">It's</a>  better just to stay home. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=932.496s">And</a>  it's just not fair for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=934.277s">And</a>  it's not fair for the people that need you in your seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=937.92s">So</a>  I was raised as a strong union member and understanding that <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=946.842s">that</a>  we're stronger in force and understanding that as long as we all work together, something positive has to come out of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=954.984s">So</a>  from one union member to others, we're standing with you and hoping someone listens and tries to put something forward in a positive way because I talked to a lot of teachers last night and I feel the frustration and I could feel, when you walk through this door, you can feel <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=977.552s">the</a>  dreariness, you can feel the negative aura. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=981.233s">And</a>  it's sad. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=982.034s">I'm</a>  sad because I love this community, I love this building. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=985.855s">And</a>  I apologize that you have to feel that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=987.736s">So</a>  again, as a council, as one council, and I think most of us, if not all, we stand with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=995.519s">So</a>  we need to find a way to create something to make sure that all of our employees are happy and they're not leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1007.62s">Because</a>  I think that you've already, like you said, we've already, we've already proven all of the unions behind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1013.407s">We've</a>  already proven that no matter what, we're still going to come in, you're still going to work your tail off for this community, and you're still going to do what's best for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1021.497s">And,</a>  and I know it's getting frustrating, and it's going to be a time when <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1026.253s">people</a>  are just going to say enough is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1028.294s">And</a>  then when someone needs a permit there's nobody there, or when someone needs a return phone call there's going to be no one there, or the children to walk into a classroom, and they're going to nobody there, or there's going to be a fire somewhere, and we're not going to have enough firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1042.683s">So</a>  these are the fears that I feel, and it's it's frightening so again, I appreciate what <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1050.84s">you</a>  did tonight for coming up, because I know it's not easy, but we're standing with you, so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1057.643s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1064.906s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1066.727s">My</a>  other two Councilors have been very eloquent in what they said, and being a former union employer, I think employees need to be treated with due respect, even if you have differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1079.677s">You</a>  sit down and you're talking, you're eyeing on your differences. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1082.399s">That's</a>  what I see as I have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1084.3s">I</a>  know I see many people in this building worked here forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1088.103s">And</a>  you are the frontline workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1090.325s">I</a>  know we have the police and the firemen, the frontline workers, but when a pipe breaks in the street, what do we call it? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1095.028s">We</a>  call it the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1096.229s">When</a>  you need your permit, you call, he comes around. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1098.951s">So</a>  these are all frontline workers, everybody here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1101.133s">These</a>  are teachers that teach my grandchildren in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1105.063s">Everyone</a>  deserves to be treated with respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1107.825s">And</a>  you're not being treated with respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1110.287s">And</a>  I say, and like my other Councilor said, I stand here with you and hopefully we can get this resolved at some point.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1125.559s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1126.26s">Thank</a>  you so much for being here today and to all of you who are here today and for <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1131.057s">speaking</a>  to the public and for speaking to us about what you've been going through and what you're trying to work on. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1135.68s">I</a>  really appreciate this update as painful as it is to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1143.904s">Like</a>  my fellow councilors, I will heartily stand with you and for your right to collectively bargain. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1150.708s">To</a>  the idea that <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1155.533s">we</a>  can't find the money to pay some of our essential workers a living wage, that that would somehow cause a dire financial situation for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1166.477s">That's</a>  hard to hear because I think we all know that the work that you do is what keeps the essential functions of the city occurring. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1176.121s">And</a>  to blame financial hardship on a reasonable cost of living adjustment, much less the raise that you so richly deserve is, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1186.91s">a</a>  pretty bad faith argument to make. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1189.432s">You</a>  know, there's a lot of situations where it feels somewhat unfortunate that all the city council can do is advocate and insist and stand with people who are campaigning for things. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1199.719s">And</a>  this is one of those scenarios, as Councilor Knight mentioned, there are places that our jurisdiction doesn't go. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1205.022s">Things</a>  that we can't make the administration do, but for myself as another councilor, please know that we stand with you and please keep us updated and know that we're standing in solidarity with you.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1223.295s">I</a>  was embarrassed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1224.536s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1226.097s">Maybe</a>  something you said really spoke to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1230.481s">And</a>  it was team player. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1233.883s">If</a>  this city is going to work, our school department is going to work from the top to the bottom, we need to be a team. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1241.589s">And</a>  to be an effective team. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1243.611s">Everyone</a>  has to have respect for each other, and everyone needs to be able to be honest with each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1249.789s">If</a>  you don't have that, you're not gonna have the collaboration that you need to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1254.051s">And</a>  what I hear every day is that people are scared to be honest in this building right now, that they're afraid to, that when they speak up, it's not gonna be, let's acknowledge that, let's take what you're saying and find the mistakes and fix the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1270.037s">It's</a>  that when you're honest, you're gonna be punished for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1274.876s">And</a>  that's not right because that destroys any semblance of bringing a team together to get the work done that this community needs to get done now I know you're doing the work every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1284.945s">But</a>  if we were working as a team, if you all felt like your voices were being heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1291.17s">We</a>  can do things better. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1293.272s">We</a>  can make things better we could make the city work better. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1297.068s">I,</a>  you know, and I'm not going to compare what we've gone through to what you've been going through because you're dealing with it, day in day out all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1304.656s">But</a>  if you watch the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1307.779s">Earlier</a>  this year, I think you'd know that that collaboration isn't happening with us either. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1314.546s">For</a>  six months, this council said here are our priorities, here's what we think's going on here's our we're trying to be honest with what we would like to see action taken from this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1326.089s">And</a>  what did we hear back, either nothing, or what we're just going to do it our way. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1331.531s">And</a>  in my way or the highway mentality is not going to get this city where it needs to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1336.702s">So,</a>  you know, I share in Councilor Knight and Councilor Collins' frustration that all we can do, and not all we can do, but that our main role right now, at least at this point in time, is just being able to stand with you and try to be honest and sit here behind this rail and say what we think is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1355.407s">But</a>  I think we really have to ask some questions and it's about what is the plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1361.982s">When</a>  someone says we can't support our workers because we have a financial problem, what is the plan to get us out of our financial problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1370.688s">What</a>  is the plan when it comes to not being able to hire people to fill all these vacancies because people don't want to come here and work because they hear in the market, I know that there are people, you know, all the way in the South coast, you know, that when people are, when cities are hiring in the South coast, they say, don't worry, it's not going to be like it is in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1393.5s">60</a>  miles away, 90 minute drive, they know it's bad here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1396.792s">They</a>  know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1399.214s">In</a>  this absence of leadership, I think it's on all of us to step up, and I'm happy that you're standing up, and I'm happy that all of the people in this room tonight are standing up for something better and stepping up, because if we don't do that, it's just gonna get worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1413.279s">So</a>  thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1414.92s">I'm</a>  thankful for your advocacy. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1416.121s">I'm</a>  thankful for the advocacy and the trying to get the word out of everyone in this room on all the issues we may hear about tonight after you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1422.503s">I</a>  think there's a lot of people who wanna speak who share very similar views to what you're sharing. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1428.285s">Because</a>  not enough people in the community really know what's going on and I think the more that they hear the more that they're going to be frustrated that the progress of our city is being put on hold, because, you know, the leadership of the city doesn't want to collaborate and work with its workers and its council and the residents to get things done. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1446.284s">So</a>  thank you for being here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1448.006s">We</a>  all stand with you and we're going to do whatever we can.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1457.647s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1459.428s">First</a>  of all, thank you for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1460.889s">And</a>  I think shining some light on an issue that not, I mean, many of our residents might know about, but it's something that's so crucial to how our city runs and how our city functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1471.437s">You</a>  are who we think about when we think of city services, the city of Medford, what our city is doing to you and the people in this audience tonight, who, you know, engage with the residents of our city, make the city work. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1485.226s">And</a>  it's <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1487.294s">It's</a>  frankly frustrating that we are at this point and that you've had to, you've, you've come to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1495.141s">You</a>  know, it's, it's beginning to look like a pattern. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1503.062s">what</a>  we've been hearing from you guys about the treatment of employees in the city and Councilor Collins and I are newer to this job but even us we've heard from city employees about the lack of morale, the lack of negotiations, the lack of good faith when it comes to <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1522.142s">just</a>  conversations and honesty about what's going on in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1526.423s">And</a>  I just, you know, my fellow councillors, I think have already stated it really well, but I do want to say, I very much support you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1536.745s">We</a>  as a council very much support you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1539.225s">And</a>  while we wish we could do more than our powers allow us to, we'll be here with you guys, fighting with you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1547.747s">And</a>  so I want you to know that you have a good ally in the city council.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1569.346s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1569.986s">Stephen</a>  South, 106 Damon Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1573.448s">President</a>  Morell, members of the city council, thank you for being here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1577.33s">Thank</a>  you for all your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1579.091s">I</a>  hope you all had a great summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1582.27s">I</a>  am also not only live in Medford but I'm also the secretary treasurer of Teamsters local 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1588.196s">We</a>  represent about eight different bargaining units within the city both on the school and the city side. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1593.701s">We're</a>  here to show solidarity with the clerical employees here in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1599.627s">And</a>  we're experiencing many of the same issues that they are we're we're in collective bargaining with all of our groups, not just in my union but other unions, and the city's taking the same position and all the negotiations, and that is number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1617.945s">Mr.</a>  nagley spoke about the inflation which today's numbers came out for August 8.3% which was even above the speculations of the economists which is incredible 8.3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1629.294s">The</a>  city is now offering us 2% wage increases to all the unions. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1634.998s">each</a>  year, but that's only if we accept a bunch of concessions, meaning, for those of you not in labor relations, we have to give back benefits that we already have in our contract benefits that everyone behind us already enjoy, we have to give those back to the city just to get 2% raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1653.468s">So</a>  you often hear people talking about all of the vacancies within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1659.609s">And</a>  last night at the council, they talked about all of the tons of teachers and paras and security people that quit over the summer that now they're shorthanded. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1670.072s">And</a>  they can't fill those positions because there's not enough money there. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1674.113s">There's</a>  not enough benefits for people to support their families. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1678.274s">And</a>  we're having the same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1680.614s">We</a>  just organized the new parking department. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1683.696s">who</a>  are making deplorable wages, not very good benefits, and the city's offering us same thing, take stuff away and give you 2% wage increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1693.529s">These</a>  are new employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1694.67s">They're</a>  all looking for jobs elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1697.342s">The</a>  DPW and the inspectors, rec department, DPW superintendents, we represent all of them, same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1705.065s">They're</a>  trying to take away a bunch of our benefits and give us menial little raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1710.147s">And</a>  they said no to almost 100% of our proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1714.269s">Don't</a>  even wanna talk about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1715.37s">No</a>  to all your stuff, give us concessions and little baby raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1720.086s">That's</a>  why you can't get anyone to take these jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1723.849s">Now,</a>  just recently, we organized right here in this building, all of the, not all, most of the department heads and assistant department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1734.236s">What</a>  does that tell you about this administration? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1738.279s">We</a>  have organized them, and one of the main reasons they organized is very similar to the clerks. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1745.398s">They</a>  have not had a raise in three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1749.163s">That's</a>  disgraceful. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1750.665s">So</a>  what is the result of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1752.727s">When</a>  I organized them less than a year ago, there were 20 something of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1759.456s">Half</a>  of the positions are vacant right now, half. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1763.601s">And</a>  of the half that are still working, 80% of them are looking for jobs in other communities right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1770.885s">Right</a>  now, 80%. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1772.806s">So</a>  how is this city going to run without department heads? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1778.108s">Just</a>  in the last four weeks, maybe you know, maybe you don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1781.99s">Last</a>  four weeks, right in this building, department heads. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1785.812s">The</a>  city solicitor, you all know who she is, resigned to go work somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1792.139s">because</a>  there's not enough pay here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1793.979s">The</a>  assistant finance director, great guy, left, quit to go work somewhere else for better pay and benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1802.722s">The</a>  assistant HR director put in her notice, she's leaving to go somewhere else. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1808.123s">Well,</a>  also because she's not treated with respect in that department. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1811.704s">We</a>  have a big HR nightmare like Councilor Knight said, I'll agree with him absolutely on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1817.745s">And</a>  just yesterday, the elections coordinator, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1822.098s">Sandra</a>  Gale, 30 years with the city of Medford, was walked out, was told, give me your ID, give me your keys, give me your passwords, clean out your desk, you're out of here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1836.362s">And</a>  the new her replacement started today, 30 years, no reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1841.049s">That's</a>  just the way this city's going. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1843.211s">In</a>  the last 12 months, you name it, IT director fired, DPW director fired. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1850.937s">We</a>  go on and on, vacancies, we don't have a city solicitor, assistant city solicitor, we don't have an assessor, we don't have an assistant assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1861.15s">No</a>  IT director, no assistant IT director. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1863.791s">How</a>  is the city running right now? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1866.213s">And</a>  I respect and appreciate every one of you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1869.234s">I</a>  have the utmost respect and I know the parameters of your job duties and what you can and can't do. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1876.438s">So</a>  believe me, I wanna make sure to the general public, I'm not blaming you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1880.48s">I</a>  think you all doing an amazing job and I appreciate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1884.465s">But</a>  this administration, my message to them is stop wasting money on private investigators to follow the employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1891.773s">Stop</a>  wasting money on arresting union officials during grievance hearings. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1897.659s">Stop</a>  wasting money on KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1900.081s">Now</a>  we don't even have a lawyer for the city where they're spending hundreds of dollars an hour every single day. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1906.165s">on</a>  stuff that a solicitor could do, or an assistant solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1909.608s">We</a>  are blowing hundreds of thousands of dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1912.03s">How</a>  about paying out millions in lawsuits? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1915.914s">I</a>  know that my union, we're filing three more federal lawsuits in the next few weeks.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1920.157s">I</a>  do wanna keep you to time, Mr. South, if you're able to.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1922.339s">Yep,</a>  I'll wrap it up, and I appreciate the reminder. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1925.622s">Let's</a>  stop wasting money on ridiculous things like I just mentioned, and let's start paying the people let's spend money on the people that make this city run the clerks the police, the fire the DPW the teachers, everybody from the department head down to the guy that sweeps the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1943.034s">We</a>  need to pay people. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1945.353s">What</a>  they deserve people, people need a proper wage and benefits to feed their families, and until that happens the city's going to continue to go in a downward spiral, and if it keeps going the way it's been going the last several weeks, you can you <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1960.415s">your</a>  bottom dollar, we may be looking at the state taking over this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1964.699s">It's</a>  a disgrace. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1966.24s">And</a>  I think the mayor and her administration need to take a hard look at all these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1970.784s">This</a>  is not grandstanding or any political activism. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1974.327s">These</a>  are all facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1975.488s">And</a>  that's why every time we come here, we give you packets of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1979.532s">They</a>  need to take a hard look at this and start doing the right thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1983.678s">Start</a>  treating these people with respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1985.961s">Until</a>  then, we'll continue to picket, we'll continue to fight, and we stand with all the workers in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=1991.889s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2019.243s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak on the clerical employees association specifically? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2023.326s">It</a>  is the clerical.</p>

    <p>[Gale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2024.647s">Okay,</a>  please go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2025.608s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2027.449s">Councilors,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2029.531s">I've</a>  been before you many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2033.213s">Until</a>  yesterday, I supervised or had the privilege of supervising two of the most hardest working people in City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2042.66s">That</a>  would be Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2043.361s">Lamoni</a>  and Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2044.422s">Brogan.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2046.297s">They</a>  are dedicated to their jobs, and I am not saying that any other clerical worker in this building are not dedicated to their jobs, but these two ladies put forth their best effort 365 days a year in a city that is continually changing because election laws are continually changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2069.062s">I</a>  would not only ask you to stand in solidarity with the clerical union, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2075.561s">But</a>  what I would ask you to do is to use your voice, your voice, your vote, your voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2085.109s">Make</a>  the people of our community understand that the people who make this building run are undervalued, underappreciated and disrespected. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2099.882s">Thank</a>  you very much for your time.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2111.173s">And</a>  is anyone else wanna speak on the Clerval Employees Association specifically, just because we do have another agenda item on public participation and I wanna give deference to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2121.081s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2121.561s">I'm</a>  just gonna move to that person and then we'll go through the rest of the... I know there's a number of people wanna speak for public participation, but there is someone on the agenda I'd like to call up. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2129.907s">I'm</a>  gonna call up the person on the agenda next.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2145.275s">Hi,</a>  good evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2146.577s">Thanks</a>  for letting me speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2148.999s">I've</a>  been reading about the new Medford parking office since they took over from pocket fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2155.066s">Many,</a>  many bad situations and no one is listening to the citizens of Medford, something has to change with this department. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2163.976s">as</a>  it is not going well. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2166.097s">Here</a>  is my street sad story. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2168.739s">On</a>  the early morning of Saturday, September 3rd, Labor Day weekend, we woke up to a flood of tickets on our street. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2177.803s">Some</a>  tickets said the cars belonged to Central Air. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2181.605s">Well,</a>  if that's the case and you write five, six, seven tickets with all cars saying this, you should know what street you're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2192.626s">and</a>  you should find out what the problem is. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2196.689s">You</a>  can see, I gave you all, you can see a ticket and a permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2205.195s">This</a>  is one of the main reasons I said at a meeting that it wasn't a good idea to get rid of the permits tickets because these scanners aren't working properly and other reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2219.448s">But</a>  wouldn't you say what is going on? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2222.311s">Wouldn't</a>  you stop and check it out? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2224.413s">If</a>  badge number 111 took the time to look at the permits on all our cars, you could clearly see something was wrong with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2233.862s">The</a>  scanner was reading as we all clearly had permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2238.646s">We</a>  need to see some retraining done. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2241.961s">Seems</a>  like he was told just to ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2244.702s">What</a>  a waste of taxpayer time and money. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2248.402s">We</a>  had to take time off from work to come down and fight these foolish tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2254.484s">He</a>  has been up and down our street many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2258.084s">No</a>  tickets for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2259.865s">Why</a>  now? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2261.365s">And</a>  the new park department is blaming Park Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2265.386s">After</a>  a year and a half, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2268.067s">I</a>  have my visitor pass that says Stearns Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2271.708s">I</a>  applied for two senior passes with my license and registration that says Stearns Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2279.51s">So</a>  they do have my information. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2282.151s">What</a>  is going to be done about this office? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2284.831s">Enough</a>  is enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2286.872s">They</a>  have had plenty of time to be up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2290.214s">The</a>  city keeps pouring money into this department and it is not working correctly. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2297.158s">We</a>  are taxpayers in the city of Medford and don't deserve to be treated like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2303.282s">I</a>  see a lot of out-of-state plates parked all over the city, especially in South Medford, but no tickets for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2312.167s">And</a>  on the day in question, there were two on our street, no tickets for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2316.871s">I</a>  feel like we have been targeted in South Medford, and I have never felt like that in the 65 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2326.219s">The</a>  day our street was ticketed, four other abutting streets were also targeted with the same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2333.125s">Please</a>  explain to me and the citizens of Medford what can be done about this office. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2339.368s">They</a>  also have a camera recording citizens, but do they have one recording inside the office, when they are rude to the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2349.22s">And</a>  I would like to ask our fine citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2353.718s">If</a>  they have had a problem with this office to please email the mayor and let her know. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2360.121s">Just</a>  one more item before I end. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2362.883s">The</a>  PAC department now has everyone's permit passes ending on December 31st. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2370.927s">How</a>  are they going to handle all of this at once when they couldn't handle it being staggered? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2377.63s">That's</a>  a big question and thank you for listening to me.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2389.677s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2390.838s">Thank</a>  you for coming out because I know it's not easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2392.958s">And</a>  we appreciate that and believe us. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2395.479s">I</a>  know for one concert, and I'm sure my fellow Councilors, we've all received emails and phone calls with very similar frustrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2403.001s">So</a>  just to be clear, you gave us a picture that it shows for automobiles that has a ticket, a permit that's updated. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2413.462s">or</a>  a permit that's updated with a handicap placket, and you were all still ticketed.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2419.046s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2419.787s">And</a>  you went to the, and what was the answer from that department?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2424.871s">They</a>  blamed Medford.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2427.236s">So</a>  did they, did they fix these?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2428.757s">They</a>  did, they did.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2429.998s">Okay,</a>  so that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2431.199s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2431.58s">Because</a>  what we've heard is there are some that they haven't, they've asked to file, go through the appeal, they lose the appeal, and then the repercussions with that is to go to the state, which is a $250 fee anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2445.231s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2445.431s">So</a>  it's frustrating.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2446.612s">So</a>  they're just going to pay the ticket, and is that how the city's getting money?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2452.557s">Unfortunately,</a>  I know I'm just asking questions we can't put anything for amendments or recommendations but maybe we'll do this next week because I think that, again, working in a community that has a very viable and transparent <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2467.242s">and</a>  involve traffic and parking department in that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2471.504s">We've</a>  had multiple meetings when it comes to any types of fee or fines or different changes to the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2478.807s">And</a>  when it happens in different neighborhoods, those neighborhoods are in meetings with their department head to discuss that as community meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2486.73s">So</a>  I'll make a recommendation next week when we can as a resolution that we recommend that our new parking department <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2495.513s">Traffic</a>  and parking department, and their director, take major steps with our communications department to start meeting with neighborhoods, even if we go from southwest hillside, the Fulton Heights North met and break it up that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2510.643s">that</a>  they can come out and have community meetings that to discuss some of these rules because there's a lot of confusion going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2517.352s">And</a>  I think that I know they said they've done something online to enlighten people, but it's just not enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2522.899s">And,</a>  and like you said as we move on to July, January 1, when this really hits. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2528.746s">I</a>  think before then we have a few months that we can still reach out to our constituents and really educate people. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2534.912s">And</a>  I think that might help with that piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2538.075s">I</a>  think transparency is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2539.816s">So</a>  I think that that'll be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2541.838s">So</a>  again, I just want to make those comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2543.78s">I</a>  appreciate you for coming up tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2546.122s">And</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2546.442s">And</a>  that last picture is of a car that hasn't moved for four months. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2550.826s">It's</a>  for sale. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2552.928s">No</a>  ticket ever.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2556.502s">I</a>  do want to know we are playing a committee of the whole on September 28th with the parking department to have a general update, but also a chance to ask questions about process and questions like how are they going to process all of these permits at the end of the year? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2570.868s">So</a>  we'll publicize that as we normally do, but we are going to host that to have an opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2577.41s">It'll</a>  be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2578.27s">People</a>  can come in, folks can ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2581.292s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2582.412s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2583.572s">Thank</a>  you for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2585.583s">Saturday</a>  morning, my phone lit up like a Christmas tree all day long, from multiple people. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2591.544s">And</a>  again, when you saw the permit there, you should have just say, hey, geez, I made a mistake, pull the ticket back again. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2598.706s">There's</a>  no need to ticket whole streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2600.627s">You're</a>  not the only street where they've gone and tagged an entire street. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2604.027s">I've</a>  heard that from multiple other streets, entire streets have got tagged. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2608.188s">This</a>  is an apartment that needs more training, both in <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2615.271s">customer</a>  service and their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2619.874s">I</a>  thank the president who's gonna have a meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2622.456s">I'm</a>  gonna have a different opinion on that the following week, but it isn't just Yacht Street, Southern Streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2628.42s">I</a>  got calls from the businesses in Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2631.963s">And</a>  I watched people pull up into parking spots that weren't there three minutes and they were tagging them. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2639.828s">And</a>  I went over to him, he says, why are you tagging this guy? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2642.87s">She's</a>  been here less than three minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2645.308s">These</a>  are fake signs, he said to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2646.949s">I</a>  said, they're not fake signs, they're signs put up by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2650.47s">And</a>  this has gone on for weeks over in Haines Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2654.912s">You're</a>  right, when we had Park Method, they mostly concentrated in the business area. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2663.495s">I</a>  haven't gotten a call from one business yet because Park Method never went into the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2670.218s">These</a>  are people going into the neighborhoods <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2672.463s">that</a>  what I say where we've never been before. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2675.785s">Maybe</a>  some of the tickets are legitimate, but we're getting ticky tack tickets for not having that little sticker on your plate, or maybe you're more than 12 inches from the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2687.432s">I</a>  think the whole department needs to maybe shut down for a little while and be retrained in multiple different areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2693.516s">And</a>  I'm gonna make that suggestion when the president calls for the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2697.898s">I'm</a>  sorry for what you had to go through. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2700.003s">My</a>  street will probably get ticketed tomorrow like they did last time I complained. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2703.385s">So</a>  I'll keep an eye out tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2707.808s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2708.148s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2708.689s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2709.049s">That's</a>  the end of public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2715.053s">That's</a>  on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2715.994s">If</a>  anyone would like to speak for public participation, please, please come up to the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2720.617s">I'll</a>  defer to you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2724.57s">Hello,</a>  hi, this is- Just name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2733.377s">Can</a>  you just lean a little bit closer to the mic? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2736.099s">I'm</a>  having trouble hearing you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2737.54s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2738.22s">He's</a>  from Wellington Woods Condo Complex.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2741.243s">for</a>  that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2741.643s">Yeah,</a>  for the come here for the noise.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2744.906s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2745.706s">Yeah,</a>  for the monogram. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2748.248s">Yeah,</a>  we have reported this issue to City Council back in August, and the building department have issued the violation letter to the to the facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2758.757s">But</a>  so far, I did not see any improvement. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2761.479s">We</a>  still hear the over over then a lot of noise <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2765.38s">And</a>  they really affect us. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2767.141s">So</a>  I want to know what city can can do to help us.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2771.264s">So</a>  I have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2772.345s">I've</a>  been in touch with the mayor about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2773.525s">I</a>  mean, I've been trying to speak with the mayor about this first of all because when the council did hear this I know we very much had concerns <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2780.49s">about</a>  noise specifically about trucks I believe it's the refrigerator trucks that are part of the issue as well as the cooling towers. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2786.954s">The</a>  mayor told me they have reached out to the owners, and I believe the next steps are to go through the Board of Health and code enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2794.699s">I</a>  was told from the administration that the issue is that this was has been a bakery space for decades, and the special permit for the hours Councilor you can correct me if I'm wrong you see you staring at me. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2808.704s">went</a>  in 1995, they said it went with the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2811.868s">So</a>  because it was not spoken up since the last since the origination of that special permit with the license, the special hours have carried with the business so long as it remains a bakery, but still they still have to comply with decibel levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2825.778s">So,</a>  the mayor has told me that code enforcement and the Board of Health will be out there to ensure that they are complying. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2832.502s">We</a>  don't have as a council we don't have direct control, but we absolutely can lean on the mayor I've spoken to the mayor I don't know about a fellow Councilor speaking to the mayor to <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2841.288s">to</a>  get the code enforcement and get the Board of Health out there to comply with the noise regulations in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2849.437s">Um,</a>  I don't have any other Councilors were able to get any other updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2852.658s">Um,</a>  I will, I will absolutely say on this, I have your email. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2855.72s">Um,</a>  please let me know any, I mean, you know, every time I know it's ongoing, please keep me in the loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2860.842s">I'll</a>  keep pushing on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2862.102s">Um,</a>  I'm going to follow up again with the mayor tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2863.983s">I</a>  don't, you know, when this company came before us, they were very responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2868.424s">So</a>  it's frustrating to me now that it seems like they're having a hard time getting in touch with the company. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2873.867s">Um,</a>  so <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2875.556s">That</a>  is the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2876.517s">I</a>  wish I had a better answer for you, but it's very much a known issue and ideally they are working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2882.202s">I'm</a>  told they're working on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2883.603s">I</a>  will keep leaning on them to make sure that this is something they address because they can't have that loud of a decibel overnight at all hours of the night.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2891.639s">Okay,</a>  can this be put on the next meeting agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2894.821s">I'm</a>  sorry, can you please put agenda put on the next agenda?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2899.504s">Yeah,</a>  would any Councilor like to do that? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2901.906s">I</a>  mean, I'm happy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2903.387s">Sure,</a>  we'll make sure it's on the next agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2904.888s">So</a>  that would be in two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2905.728s">And</a>  yep, we can speak to it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2907.189s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2907.389s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2908.17s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2908.55s">I</a>  have. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2916.095s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2917.436s">Anyone</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2921.383s">Just</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2924.024s">Rick</a>  Sacco, 21 Ridgeway Road Method. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2926.505s">My</a>  story starts very simply. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2929.565s">I</a>  have a tree in front of my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2931.486s">It's</a>  a Norwood maple. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2932.526s">It's</a>  a very nice tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2934.427s">It's</a>  on city property. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2935.607s">I</a>  went down to the DPW because I was concerned about some serious overhanging of some limbs that I felt that were a danger to the public, a safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2948.572s">So</a>  I went to the DPW and I asked them if they could have a city go down and trim those limbs off the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2956.594s">I</a>  was told that I own the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2960.354s">I</a>  said, I own a city tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2962.855s">She</a>  said, yeah, well, you own a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2965.215s">I</a>  said, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2966.656s">Well,</a>  I guess the ordinance says that if you own a private way and you have a tree in front of your house, you own that tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2974.827s">you</a>  are responsible for that tree, unless it's a public safety issue, then the city will come in and trim the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2982.89s">So</a>  I said, well, I'm gonna go out and get a quote from a tree service company, which they came out and I'll read the quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2996.654s">This</a>  is a very reputable company. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=2999.648s">It</a>  says a safety pruning of a Norway maple, remove large dead wood, rotting and weak branches. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3007.532s">Perform</a>  a weight reduction when necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3010.413s">Clean</a>  up wood and brush. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3013.094s">Gave</a>  me a price. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3013.834s">So</a>  I take this down to the DPW commissioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3019.097s">They</a>  go into the office, they look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3021.358s">They</a>  come out, basically says to me, well, the quote doesn't say public safety issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3027.841s">So</a>  what do you mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3029.164s">Well,</a>  it has to say public safety, it's a public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3033.267s">I</a>  said, so the word public, if it's not on the quote, that means I don't get the tree tripped. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3039.731s">So</a>  my question is this, anybody that has a tree that's on a private way in the city of Medford, they own that tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3048.618s">I</a>  just want the people to know that's listening in, that this is a new ordinance that has to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3054.922s">It's</a>  a simple thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3057.031s">I'm</a>  not asking for sewers, I'm not asking for curbing, because a public way requires curbing and sewage. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3065.575s">Private</a>  ways do not require that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3068.216s">But</a>  all I'm looking for is to have my tree trimmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3070.738s">That's</a>  it, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3072.399s">The</a>  other issue, which doesn't have to do with trees, and I wanna make the public aware of this, that live on private ways, is that if, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3084.777s">If</a>  your street is torn up from excessive traffic, and it's a private way, and that street has to be repaved, the cost of that repaving is done by the people that live on that street, not by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3102.768s">The</a>  public way is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3105.317s">So</a>  I live on Ridgeway Road, I'm getting off in a little bit here, but I live on Ridgeway Road, and between six and nine o'clock, 10 o'clock in the morning, there's 80 to 100 cars that go down that street. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3117.884s">That's</a>  a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3118.944s">Now</a>  that street is getting worn, you can see cracks in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3124.307s">If</a>  that street gets deteriorated to the point of rebating, we have to pay for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3130.383s">So</a>  I just want the public to know this, but all I'm asking for is the council to go into committee or rules and just very simply say, if you live on a private way and you have a tree in front of your house, the city will trim it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3145.965s">I'll</a>  replace it if necessary.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3147.185s">We</a>  do have Commissioner McGibbon on the call because I've had instances, I live on a private way too, I've actually had neighbors that have been told the exact opposite. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3156.528s">So</a>  I just want to, if Commissioner McGibbon, he's here for another reason, but I don't know, Commissioner McGibbon, if you're... If we can't do it, I know we're focusing on</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3165.771s">looking</a>  to change that policy now because of the lack of federal funding, because we have so many private ways in this community that we're looking to eliminate the private way, and that would eliminate any of those concerns, Mr. Sacco.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3180.476s">That's</a>  going to take time.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3181.736s">It</a>  does, but this is the reason the community should know as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3187.078s">This</a>  is why we should, you know, there's so many different factors to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3193.695s">this</a>  situation to help our community, whether it's more funding from the government to repave streets or having issues like this where, you know, DPW's hands are tied because these, this rules that need to be changed that say that we can't trim a tree that has public safety concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3211.64s">So,</a>  because we do have, we do have students still walking down that street to go to school when it's walk Metro day. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3217.662s">And</a>  if it's under a tree that's that safe, I hope that <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3220.863s">Mr.</a>  McGiven can help us with that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3222.544s">Commissioner</a>  McGiven, if you could clarify what the ownership is of trees on private ways that might be, you know, abutting the street.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3233.988s">I'm</a>  happy to, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3235.569s">I'm</a>  happy to, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3239.211s">So</a>  this does come up quite often. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3241.152s">We</a>  don't actually rule if a tree is in a private way, who owns it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3245.254s">We</a>  just determine if we are responsible for it or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3248.936s">So</a>  in other words, we answer the question, is this tree under the care and control of the city or is this under the care and control of somebody else? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3256.86s">So</a>  that's what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3257.62s">We're</a>  not saying it's your tree or it's her tree <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3261.962s">or</a>  whatever, we're just saying, oh, that doesn't meet chapter 87 definition of a public shade tree, or it's not a publicly owned tree on public property. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3271.49s">So</a>  it's something other than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3274.112s">So</a>  I just want to clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3276.374s">And</a>  then as far as trimming trees on private ways, we do actually do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3281.317s">If</a>  the branch is hanging over the private way, because the public actually has rights in the public way, and we would protect those rights. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3291.045s">So</a>  we do that quite often. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3292.046s">So</a>  there's a private way and there's a limb hanging off. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3296.249s">And</a>  we usually don't know who the owner of the tree is. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3299.771s">If</a>  we do, we notify the owner. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3300.912s">But</a>  if we don't, then we remove the tree on behalf of the safety of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3305.575s">We</a>  do the same thing on private ways with potholes. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3308.356s">And</a>  also, I believe we plow private ways so emergency vehicles can get in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3314.58s">So</a>  that's a really sort of very quick summary, but I do recall this instant, and I do recall that we determined that the work on the tree or the issue at hand wasn't an immediate threat to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3328.47s">Therefore,</a>  the city wouldn't have a right under the law to go do anything to that tree because it's not under our care and control. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3336.075s">Hopefully</a>  that makes sense.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3338.497s">It</a>  does. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3339.317s">I</a>  understand what you're saying, but my question also is the liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3345.27s">What</a>  happens if a limb falls off that tree and lands on someone's head that's walking underneath the tree and they're seriously injured? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3353.696s">Who's</a>  liable? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3357.379s">Me,</a>  the person that the tree's in front of or the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3361.842s">Is</a>  the city liable for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3363.263s">If</a>  that limb comes down and hits somebody and damages a person or a car or whatever, am I responsible or is the city responsible? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3372.256s">You're</a>  saying, the city's saying that it's not danger. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3375.757s">So</a>  what happens if we get a windstorm and that limb, and these are big limbs, and it comes down and it takes somebody out, who's responsible? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3383.019s">I'm</a>  not gonna be responsible.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3383.96s">Are</a>  you able to address that, Commissioner McGivern?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3385.56s">So</a>  that's another issue that maybe somebody should be looking at too. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3389.161s">Who's</a>  liable on that kind of a situation?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3392.922s">Because</a>  I have- We can let him answer.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3396.094s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3396.935s">No,</a>  we don't make determinations on liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3399.477s">That</a>  would definitely be legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3400.858s">What</a>  we do do is make a reasonable assessment of the risk to the public on a hanging limb on a private tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3406.622s">So</a>  if we feel that that the immediate threat to the public that can't be resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3411.379s">in</a>  a matter of time by the owner, or you might not know the owners, we do react to that situation and remove the limb. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3419.087s">Every</a>  other scenario about weighing liabilities, I'm not gonna weigh in on, and who owns a tree and who owns liability and all that, it's a lot of nuance in the law.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3428.037s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3432.595s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3432.855s">I</a>  hope that it addressed some of your questions.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3434.736s">I</a>  know it's- I'm happy to revisit it again.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3438.597s">Sir,</a>  if you believe that it is a truly a threat to the public that's immediate, that needs to be resolved, we will revisit that with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3444.72s">I'm</a>  not gonna deny that for sure.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3446.581s">If</a>  there needs to be- I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3448.381s">I</a>  had the tree warden come out and look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3452.023s">I</a>  understand that she determined it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3455.044s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3456.145s">But</a>  I have a professional tree company that's been in business 30 years that says, yes, it is a safety issue.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3462.388s">And</a>  I'm- It could be a safety issue on the private side, it could be a safety, there's a tree on private land that is creating a threat, not in an area that's- City property, it's on the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3473.159s">Like</a>  I said, we'll revisit that with you, for certain.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3475.081s">If</a>  it's an immediate threat to the public- I'd appreciate it if you'd look at it again and make another determination on it.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3481.327s">Well,</a>  we'll go through the tree warden. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3483.429s">We</a>  will go through the tree warden.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3484.43s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3486.832s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3487.312s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3487.712s">And</a>  like Councilor Caraviello said, just for the edification of the public, we're looking at, the city is looking at both private and public ways, and Councilor Caraviello has asked for a meeting around that to see what can be done to, because there are so many private ways within the city, as well as we are working on a tree ordinance that's lots of things to consider.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3506.74s">And</a>  the other thing is, it's a nice tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3509.642s">It's</a>  a Norwood maple, and I really want to save the tree, because I figure if I could take these limbs down, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3515.824s">it's</a>  only going to give growth to the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3517.965s">So</a>  it's not like I'm, you know, it's more than, it's a safety issue, but it's also an issue where I want to save that tree.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3524.63s">Of</a>  course. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3525.15s">Of</a>  course.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3525.711s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3526.251s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3526.931s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3529.813s">Anyone</a>  else who'd like to, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3531.614s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3532.655s">Mr.</a>  Sacco, thank you for coming down. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3535.637s">This</a>  is an issue that I brought up at the last meeting and it's, it's gone to our rules committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3541.321s">I</a>  want a definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3543.98s">on</a>  to what a private way is. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3545.421s">I</a>  want to know what the city is responsible for and what the property owners are responsible for. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3553.244s">And</a>  if they're not entitled to the same benefits that the regular taxpayer is, then the people who live on these private ways should be classified at a lower tax rate, seeing if they're not going to get the same benefits that someone who lives on the public way is. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3569.357s">There</a>  will be a meeting very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3571.658s">I'm</a>  not on that particular committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3573.079s">I</a>  think Councilor Bears is on that committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3575.44s">And</a>  that'll be discussed that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3577.861s">I'll</a>  be here that night to help on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3580.102s">But</a>  again, something I brought up a few weeks ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3583.744s">I</a>  don't think it's fair that young people like you, myself, Councilor Murray, we all live in private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3589.247s">I</a>  don't know what benefit I get out of it other than I paid to pave my own street when it had to be paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3596.872s">If</a>  these residents are going to get the same benefits that the other people are paid the same tax rate, maybe they should be classified different in the lower rate.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3604.775s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3606.536s">But</a>  anyone else like to speak for public participation.</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3738.471s">Did</a>  we put in for it, did we ask for anything? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3742.672s">Might</a>  have been a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3743.872s">I'm</a>  just not sure about it, I don't really know. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3747.613s">The</a>  other thing is we have been asking for a grant writer for many years, City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3755.354s">What's</a>  that? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3757.155s">Okay,</a>  yeah, back in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3758.655s">Another</a>  great idea, I don't think we have one again. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3763.776s">A</a>  neighbor in the City of Medford, Tufts University, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3769.24s">not</a>  sure what they're contributing, it'd be nice for them to help out in these times. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3775.164s">As</a>  far as negotiating and selling agreements, we have KP Law coming in to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3782.889s">KP</a>  Law is, looks like they're a city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3787.812s">I'd</a>  love to get a copy of KP Law's contract with the city, what their billable hour rate is, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3795.38s">and</a>  what they've been paid to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3797.622s">I'd</a>  asked the city solicitor but apparently we don't have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3802.047s">Just</a>  to just to let you guys know what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3804.75s">I</a>  would love to work with the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3807.152s">I</a>  would love to settle our contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3809.735s">I</a>  don't think anybody's going to settle the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3812.418s">The</a>  teachers are in mediation at the request of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3821.993s">They</a>  didn't want this, we don't want to go to arbitration, but that's where we're going to end up. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3827.217s">This</a>  is how we do business here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3829.038s">Unfortunately,</a>  sad to say, like to see some changes here I'd like to see some grievances settled. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3833.882s">I</a>  don't know by who, I guess KP law is going to have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3837.064s">This</a>  business looks good for KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3842.908s">I'd</a>  like for some of the somebody administration somebody at City Hall who maybe was hired to do that, to do that work. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3851.263s">but</a>  I don't know what's gonna happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3852.986s">I</a>  would love to see some progress on these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3856.273s">I</a>  thank you for the forum and I thank you for your dedication and hard work.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3861.062s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3868.742s">want</a>  to answer this question.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3871.204s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3872.225s">Thank</a>  you for coming up on wishing us about KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3875.948s">That's</a>  been asked several times for since KP laws come on board for a list of their billing and since they were 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3888.951s">2020,</a>  we've asked for a list of all settlements that have been paid out in bills from KP Law since day one. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3898.413s">The</a>  original agreement that we agreed to was $5,000 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3903.094s">Up</a>  until today, I haven't seen a bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3905.975s">I</a>  think I've asked for it a couple of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3907.475s">I</a>  know other Councilors have asked for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3909.875s">How</a>  much money have we spent with KP Law? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3911.896s">We</a>  haven't gotten it yet.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3914.994s">and</a>  then we'll go to you guys.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3916.315s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3917.496s">Just</a>  a couple things to add on KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3920.558s">Number</a>  one, we've been requesting documentation on it for two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3927.184s">The</a>  only documentation I saw was a completely blacked out invoice that was attempted to be used for backup for federal grants and can't possibly be, you know, it's determined by regulations can't possibly be used as backup for federal grants because it doesn't <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3942.412s">include</a>  any identifying information as to what the money has been spent on. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3945.443s">So</a>  that's one thing that the only thing that I've seen out of KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3949.237s">I'll</a>  say another thing about KP Law, the minute that we voted to cut that budget was the minute that all hell broke loose. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3954.301s">So</a>  I'll just leave that at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3957.043s">When</a>  it comes to the funding piece, Mr. Jones, I appreciate you bringing it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3960.506s">I</a>  do have a couple of things on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3963.568s">One</a>  is to request that the administration provide an update on all pilot agreements and the status of negotiations on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3968.632s">So</a>  Tufts University, Harvard Vanguard, Rivers Edge. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3973.296s">And</a>  something I've been talking about for a long time and I think it's about time to get going on is <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3978.079s">budget</a>  needs assessment ordinance so that we can actually have a budget process where we are determining what our needs are, what our existing revenues are the gap and then talk about the plan to meet that need, because I think <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3991.95s">We</a>  can't keep using lack of funding as an excuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3994.891s">We</a>  need to have a plan to bring in the funding we need to meet the needs of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=3998.673s">So</a>  I do have some stuff on the agenda tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4000.894s">I'm</a>  looking forward to working with my Councilor, fellow Councilors on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4003.715s">But</a>  yeah, when it comes to KPL, all I know is the only documentation we've received has been all blacked out.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4013.135s">And</a>  I do find it curious, Madam President, when we take a look at this agenda this evening, papers from the administration, and we'll see that they're trying to upgrade a position in the Community Development Department, but we have created a new position, upgrading the existing position from the land use planner to a senior planner. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4032.164s">Non-union</a>  role, we've seen more and more requests for non-union positions to get pay raises. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4037.586s">More</a>  and more requests for non-union. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4039.572s">positions</a>  to be reclassified. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4041.553s">We</a>  still have the issue of our human resource director working out of grade now for the better part of two and a half years and not being required to pay back any money. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4052.416s">Not</a>  being paid back any money to the taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4054.777s">So</a>  we have a human resource director who's being paid out of grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4058.178s">This</a>  council voted down, voted down the reclassification of the position. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4063.879s">Gentleman's</a>  still being paid between $69,000, I think more than what his initial salary was as diversity director. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4070.714s">And</a>  here we are with teachers educators in this community, fighting for a pittance 2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4078.483s">So</a>  what's that 35 bucks a week.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4081.727s">So,</a>  it's a little more than last night at the school committee meeting that was.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4087.685s">Just</a>  name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4088.945s">I'm</a>  sorry, Charlene Douglas phone for high street method mass president of the teacher association. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4094.427s">So</a>  last night at the school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4097.909s">It</a>  was clearly pointed out and as it should be it that the city, the school side administration, they have offered us a 7.25% increase over three years, 2.75 2.25 and two, I mean 2.5 <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4118.168s">2.25</a>  and 2.5. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4119.15s">I</a>  believe that's the exact numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4122.193s">They</a>  also are giving us a one time bonus of $1,000 that each year that does not apply to the base of our salaries, so it doesn't really benefit, you know, our teachers that <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4136.63s">You</a>  know, moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4138.793s">And</a>  while we appreciate that and you know, obviously we understand that we have a difference of opinion on how so funds can be used and we've shared the commissioners educations statement on that we've talked about chapter 170. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4153.326s">funding</a>  which Mr. Murphy spoke about to last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4156.467s">So</a>  we've, we've done all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4158.468s">And</a>  so we have a difference of opinion, our proposal right now on the table is for 10% over three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4166.651s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4167.412s">And</a>  in the open letter to the city to from the school department and the letter that was posted, it said that with the $1,000, it comes out to a 9.2. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4182.068s">percentage</a>  increase over three years but not really, because you can't count those thousand dollar bonuses in your percentage it doesn't impact, moving forward, you know what you're going to do and it doesn't even count towards your retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4196.099s">So</a>  for example, I can't get a bonus. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4198.942s">And</a>  because that doesn't count. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4200.323s">If</a>  it isn't our contract, it does not count. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4203.525s">So</a>  I could do work outside <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4206.01s">and</a>  it's not there, it doesn't count. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4207.891s">And</a>  that happens to many of us, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4210.512s">But</a>  I wanted to, the reason I came up is I wanted to state two things. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4214.874s">Number</a>  one is that last night we learned that there are three tentative agreements on the school side between the Carpenters and the, I believe it's four members, the Carpenters and Maintenance, sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4231.341s">Yeah,</a>  I know, the Carpenters and Maintenance, so there's four. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4233.705s">the</a>  nurses and the administrative assistants which are the secretaries on the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4238.107s">So</a>  we've heard that there were three tentative agreements with a two to two for each one of those in regarding the, the mediation, and that we're at an impasse. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4251.673s">Today,</a>  we filed an objection to the petition for mediation. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4257.525s">The</a>  method teachers, we filed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4259.768s">We</a>  do not believe we are in pass, and we were very, very surprised to learn, and we learned it on Thursday at our negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4270.938s">We</a>  learned that they were going to go to impasse, and then they posted that letter on their school webpage, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4280.995s">And</a>  we did post today a response to that letter on our website and on our Facebook page. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4289.098s">So</a>  that's all I want to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4290.558s">And</a>  just to let you know, so we're willing to go back to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4294.039s">We</a>  want to be at the table and we never said we never, we have never stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4298.101s">Matter</a>  of fact, last night, one of the members of the negotiating team felt totally disrespected and stated very clearly that we do want to be at the table and we have made progress at that table on some issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4311.353s">and</a>  they're up and it's in the petition impasse filed by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4316.937s">It</a>  was more than just compensation that they cited. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4319.619s">Okay,</a>  so thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4322.601s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4323.461s">Can</a>  we get a report on who's doing the negotiations with the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4334.709s">I</a>  mean, I don't know who's, is the mayor at the table? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4338.211s">Who's</a>  at the table doing these negotiations?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4341.277s">So</a>  on the school side. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4344.099s">The</a>  school side it's central administration that's at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4349.742s">The</a>  mayor did attend one meeting on August 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4355.846s">So</a>  she did attend a meeting one negotiations meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4360.709s">There</a>  was also. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4363.983s">So</a>  in our rebuttal, it says that not one elected school committee member is sat at our table. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4370.87s">So</a>  we stand by that, that not one elected school committee member is at our table. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4377.096s">So</a>  the mayor is not elected to the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4379.459s">Who</a>  is at the table?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4380.62s">Mr.</a>  David Murphy.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4382.221s">Okay,</a>  and he's representing the city?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4384.283s">He's</a>  part of the city so it's Mr. Murphy, the superintendent of schools, and they can choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4388.187s">So</a>  I'm not saying they can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4391.81s">Mr.</a>  Cushing, the assistant superintendent, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4395.513s">Galussi</a>  is also there. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4400.898s">Joan</a>  Bowen, the director of special needs, and Howard Greenspan is there for the attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4407.584s">He</a>  is always at the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4409.526s">And</a>  what am I forgetting? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4412.721s">Superintendent</a>  is one more person. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4414.643s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4416.925s">I'm</a>  sorry, I'm drawing a blank.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4418.366s">And</a>  who's negotiating for the city yet, on the city contracts?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_18]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4422.649s">Okay,</a>  I can only speak to the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4423.97s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[South]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4425.006s">On</a>  the city end, KP Law runs 100% of the negotiations. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4430.609s">It's</a>  a gentleman named Attorney Brian Mazur is doing everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4435.612s">They</a>  bring a guy in also to just sit there and say nothing for all the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4439.795s">Who's</a>  this guy? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4440.555s">His</a>  name's Neil. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4441.496s">He's</a>  the human resources director for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4444.358s">He</a>  sits there with a mask on and does not say a word for any of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4448.96s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4449.16s">We</a>  can just keep to the facts, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4451.622s">That's</a>  the facts, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4454.965s">For</a>  our negotiations, we've had various chiefs of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4457.826s">We've</a>  had multiple lawyers from KP Law, and one guy is at every meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4463.468s">The</a>  HR director, Mr. Osborne, what's his title? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4467.149s">Not</a>  sure what that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4468.71s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4469.75s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4471.07s">Mr.</a>  Mercury, do you want to speak?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4479.573s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, members of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4482.74s">pleasure</a>  to be with you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4484.021s">Name</a>  and address the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4485.521s">Uh,</a>  David Murphy, assistant superintendent, finance and operations for the Metropolitan Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4489.743s">Uh,</a>  Miss Douglas is correct with respect to, uh, are the representatives of the school community negotiating team, as as is the case with the vast majority of school districts in the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4500.908s">The</a>  school committee delegates that negotiating authority to the senior leadership. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4505.59s">So</a>  the superintendent myself, other members of the executive leadership team, along with <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4510.032s">our</a>  longtime school district council, Mr. Greenspan, who I know some of you have worked closely with over the years, have been in attendance over the course of the 10 months, the 17 bargaining sessions, as well as, frankly, several other meetings in which the parties have exchanged proposals and discussed the implications of those proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4528.962s">The</a>  vice chair, Graham, and the mayor have also attended meetings <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4533.944s">as</a>  part of an attempt to resolve this, which was discussed at length during last night's school committee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4540.947s">The</a>  only comment I would add beyond responding to Mr. Carballo's question is that the committee made the decision to declare an impasse and file for a petition for mediation with the Department of Labor Relations reluctantly. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4556.345s">But</a>  at the same time, we don't see it as something that should delay the resolution of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4562.568s">In</a>  fact, it's our hope that it will, it will accelerate that conversation and get to a resolution as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4572.732s">I</a>  don't understand the message that you're trying to send. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4574.533s">So</a>  you have a group of 500 teachers that you're negotiating with and you're going to the labor board and you're saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4580.595s">We</a>  reached an impasse which really means we don't want to negotiate anymore we're walking from the table but then at the same breath is saying we do want to negotiate.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4587.221s">I</a>  just I totally disagree with that characterization. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4590.004s">We're</a>  trying to seek support from a mediator to try to break the logjam, so that we can get a competitive and sustainable wage increase to our teachers, we think that's what they deserve and that's why we've done that.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4600.493s">Right,</a>  so now we're in a situation where we have <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4602.795s">other</a>  bargaining units that are receiving a cost of living adjustment right which is really just a cost of living adjustment to combat inflation at the battle inflation right so now we have units that have settled contracts at two percent and now we're giving cost of living adjustments at a different rate to other employees so it kind of sends a message of value the work of some more than others and that the impact on the economic factors that are happening around all of us um <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4629.775s">don't</a>  impact those traffic supervisors, for example, or those school nurses in the same fashion that they would impact the school teacher.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4637.819s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4638.199s">Can</a>  I just respond quickly? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4640.401s">One,</a>  I'd be hesitant to characterize the specific of tentative agreements that haven't been made public. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4646.084s">The</a>  second thing I would say is that we do not value <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4653.209s">differently</a>  the hard work and dedication of our employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4657.072s">That</a>  said, the economic impact of a unit with three employees versus a unit with 500 employees is different. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4665.638s">And</a>  so I think that's why it's important that each negotiation be looked at on a case by case basis so that we can treat each unit and group of employees fairly and at the same time do right by the community and our representation of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4679.272s">And</a>  that's what the school district has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4681.414s">And</a>  we're proud that we've been able to reach resolution with three of these groups over the course of the last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4688.579s">And</a>  as I said, we hope to reach resolution with all units, including the teachers, as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4695.184s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Murphy. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4695.805s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4697.546s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4698.507s">Just</a>  two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4699.968s">One's</a>  for clarity purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4703.12s">Even</a>  though an impasse has been declared, I just want to make sure I hear what you're saying, that doesn't preclude, would you negotiate while you're waiting for a mediator to be assigned?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4710.465s">We</a>  don't anticipate waiting an extended period of time for the mediator. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4714.107s">If</a>  there was some type of pronounced delay for some reason, that's certainly something that we would consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4719.39s">But</a>  our point and the school committee's point in filing this is that there have been a number of exchanges within the discourse <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4727.575s">and</a>  reflecting upon the proposals that have been exchanged. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4730.336s">We</a>  don't believe the parties are going to be able to make progress until some variable changes, and that's why we're looking for the mediators' support in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4738.7s">But</a>  if a session was requested, would you have a session is all I'm really asking. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4744.262s">where</a>  the petition was just filed on Thursday. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4746.863s">So</a>  our position is we're going to wait to hear from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4749.863s">And</a>  it's our, as I said, we think the timeline is going to be very consistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4753.304s">But</a>  as I said to the school committee last night, who asked a very reasonable question as to what is my expectation with regard to a timeline, given that I'm only representing one party, I can't frankly speak to that with any greater specificity than I could without the mediator. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4765.906s">But</a>  it is our hope that this will accelerate that process because we want a resolution as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4771.288s">Okay,</a>  thanks. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4772.048s">And</a>  the second question, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4774.393s">You</a>  know, I've been following, I've been listening, we've been talking about this, we had a budget hearing, this came up then, we've had a lot of meetings about this, and you've had a lot of meetings about this, and everyone's had a lot of meetings about this, I think that's the one thing we maybe can all agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4788.005s">When</a>  you are talking about sustainability of the contract, and that's your characterization of it, what financial information are you being given by the city of Medford <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4801.953s">that</a>  you're making your determinations on? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4803.594s">Are</a>  you being told what to expect next year from the budget? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4807.115s">Do</a>  they have figures that are coming to you? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4808.695s">And</a>  I think the real issue here, we're talking a lot about the different positions, we're talking a lot about the different offers, talking about 2%, 3% offers. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4817.899s">At</a>  the end of the day, this is gonna come down to dollars, and the dollars in the budget, and what the school committee requests, and what is allocated by the mayor, and then what we try to move forward on. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4830.4s">But</a>  we're not talking about any of this in dollar terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4832.622s">So</a>  it's like actually having the answer, you know, what's the real, what's the real gap? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4836.766s">Are</a>  you being told, this is your allocation next year, this is what you can expect to get from the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4842.412s">And</a>  that's the limit on your contract negotiation? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4845.035s">Or</a>  do you do we not even have the information? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4847.277s">Are</a>  we going off of estimates? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4848.458s">Are</a>  we going off projections? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4849.819s">You</a>  know, what information do you have? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4852.602s">that</a>  you're using to make the decisions to outline your bargaining position?</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4856.044s">Sure,</a>  that's a that's a totally fair question, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4860.066s">What</a>  I would say is number one, we don't have a secret data sheet that tells us exactly what the budget is going to be in the years ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4866.149s">So</a>  that's that's not the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4868.05s">But</a>  what we do have is an understanding as to what the budgetary capacities for the city and what the trajectory of that is given the limitations on the tax levy that I know all of you are familiar with. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4880.037s">So</a>  our <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4883.271s">projections</a>  are based on that anticipated growth over a period of time and what the existing capacity is and what it will likely be in the years ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4892.874s">There</a>  are, as I said last night, variables that could change, some of which that are beyond the scope of the municipality, certainly with respect to chapter 70 funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4903.256s">And</a>  in some of the information that the union has shared, the sort of position, which again, I'm not, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4909.898s">I'm</a>  not opining about this, I'm just saying that I'm relaying the information that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4913.38s">Douglas</a>  and her team have shared publicly, is that if we were to commit to a financial, an agreement beyond our current financial capacity, and that variable were to change based on increased investment in Chapter 70, which is, I'm assuming I'm in front of the school committee, so excuse me, Chapter 70 being the state's education allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4935.872s">Which</a>  we send mostly to charter schools anyway, but continue. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4939.643s">Very</a>  few of us agree with the formula. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4940.984s">So</a>  I think that's probably true. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4942.505s">And</a>  I think the union would agree with that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4944.325s">But</a>  if that number were to increase, then potentially that capacity could be greater and we could potentially commit more resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4952.529s">However,</a>  there's two issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4954.71s">One,</a>  the needs of our students are increasing as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4958.151s">And</a>  so we have to <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4960.352s">consider</a>  all of our financial obligations in the context of increasingly expensive needs on the part of kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4966.277s">The</a>  second thing that we have to take into account is that that that increases uncertain because it's based on state revenues on a year over year basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4974.183s">And</a>  so it would be in our view irresponsible to commit to a financial agreement that is beyond the scope of our current capacity in the hope that some variable changes and there is there's more money available. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4985.552s">And</a>  so, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=4987.533s">In</a>  the event that scope changes I think the school committee as the bargaining agent might be in a different position but right now we are not and we think our responsibility committee feels it's responsibility is to operate within the capacity that we do have and make a responsible deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5003.957s">Last</a>  thing I'll say and probably I know this is a lengthy answer, my final point, the seven and a quarter percent over three years <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5010.518s">that</a>  we've offered in addition to the one-time $1,000 payments made possible through the grants, which, as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5017.961s">Douglas</a>  correctly points out, would not be incorporated into that base pay, is a significantly more competitive offer than has been the outcome of the previous three collective bargaining agreements over the course of the past 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5031.448s">Now,</a>  the context has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5033.529s">Inflation</a>  is a real thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5034.749s">The</a>  burdens of <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5036.663s">Educating</a>  students coming out of a pandemic are real things. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5039.145s">So</a>  we should be offering a more competitive deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5041.987s">But</a>  as I said last night, we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5045.069s">And</a>  so the suggestion that somehow we are intentionally offering a deal that is meant to be disrespectful, I think is just not an accurate characterization of where these negotiations are.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5060.32s">I</a>  appreciate the answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5062.675s">I</a>  appreciate that there's variables in the situation, but if you're making, let's say this, you have your projections, you're making your decisions based on your assumption that those projections are the best possible projection you can make at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5076.523s">And</a>  then you talked about variables that could increase revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5079.304s">You</a>  left out one key variable that could increase revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5082.846s">And</a>  that is that the mayor submits a budget and the mayor could commit to submit a budget with the revenue necessary to fund something. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5091.791s">Now</a>  I understand it's a difficult position that you're in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5094.913s">But,</a>  you know, this is a large city budget, things get reallocated there's a free cash you know we're going to certify free cash in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5102.737s">So</a>  I just want to put the point out there that at the end of the day this comes down to dollars and cents, and there's only one person empowered by the city charter to make a commitment to use city funds to fund something like this, and it hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5113.463s">So,</a>  when we talk about what <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5117.313s">You</a>  know, I think Secretary Rousseau mentioned last night that we are living in a system that's designed to have us at each other's throats because we have this false notion of scarcity that's being imposed on us by the state laws and regulatory systems we're under. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5130.395s">We</a>  also do have choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5132.456s">And</a>  I understand you're not in, you know, you're in the position that you're in, but whether we're talking about the needs of the students or the needs to fund the contract, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5144.698s">There</a>  is a someone who could make a commitment as part of this process to make sure that the money is there and it seems that that hasn't happened and I just want to make that point very clear that that's how the laws of the city work. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5154.664s">And,</a>  you know, we talked about sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5159.327s">We</a>  are setting the conditions of what sustainable means. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5162.615s">And</a>  the person at the top of the leadership of the city is setting the conditions of what sustainable means, and clearly, there's a vast disagreement that, or at least a general consensus that those conditions are unsatisfactory. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5176.446s">So</a>  I understand that you're in the position you're in you're not the person who makes that choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5180.549s">But</a>  when we talk about the variables we can talk all we want about hoping the state's going to come in and save us they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5185.823s">The</a>  chapter 70 formula doesn't benefit this city because our property values are too high.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5189.725s">So</a>  just respectfully, that's the point that the district has been making to the union for some time, that assuming the chapter 70 increase is going to somehow skyrocket so that we can afford the 18% over three year proposal that the union initially made is not accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5206.075s">We</a>  can't count on it, it would be irresponsible for us to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5208.796s">So</a>  I will say again, this is really my final point, I hope, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5213.025s">We</a>  have no intention of disrespecting our teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5215.646s">We</a>  understand that they have carried this district and this community on their back through the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5220.567s">We</a>  know how dependent we are on them, but the only way we're going to be able to employ them in the numbers we need to, to provide all the services and support to students that they need, is to have a competitive but sustainable wage increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5233.23s">And</a>  therefore we have to operate within our capacity. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5235.671s">That</a>  is the point that we have been making, Mr. Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5237.551s">For</a>  17 months.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5241.712s">I</a>  do want to, I would like I would entertain a motion at this point for me to go, which is fine.</p>

    <p>[Murphy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5250.421s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5252.924s">patiently</a>  for items on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5254.906s">If</a>  you can keep it brief.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5256.628s">Just</a>  one sentence, the person who sets the capacity that we're talking about that determines sustainability is the mayor of the city of Medford, period.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5271.677s">and</a>  then I would love a motion to reverse the regular business.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5274.82s">Listen,</a>  we sit here and talk about craziest stuff for all night long about stuff that doesn't even matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5280.144s">This</a>  is something that's very important to the lives of at least 500 people that reside in this community.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5284.407s">And</a>  we have been speaking about it for 90 minutes.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5286.649s">That's</a>  okay, but it is what it is, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5288.41s">I</a>  mean, we got to do with this, what we're here for, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5290.452s">We</a>  voted to go bi-weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5291.452s">We're</a>  going to have to deal with some long meetings sometimes.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5294.194s">And</a>  I am happy to revisit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5296.316s">You</a>  have something brief right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5297.577s">I'm</a>  happy to revisit it.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5299.158s">I</a>  just want to get to the city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5300.839s">I'm</a>  happy to revisit it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5302.28s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5302.861s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5303.241s">We</a>  suspended the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5304.081s">We</a>  didn't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5304.722s">We</a>  voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5305.563s">We're</a>  in the situation we're in. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5307.884s">You</a>  know, when listening to what Mr. Murphy said about the most recent package being better than the last three collective bargaining agreements, I've been around a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5317.811s">And</a>  you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5319.512s">Maybe</a>  the employees took less back then, but we didn't hear him complain because they felt a lot more appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5324.977s">And</a>  I think that that's really a reoccurring theme that I'm feeling and that I'm hearing across many departments here in the city, but the school department's not exempt. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5334.046s">So</a>  when we sit here and we talk about the filing for an impasse as a way for us to move closer to a settlement, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5342.373s">In</a>  my opinion, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5343.274s">It</a>  sounds more to me like the administration just trying to control the narrative and the public perception as to what's going on than <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5350.861s">actual</a>  progress towards a settlement and really sounds just like a counter to the June budget job action that was taken and the job actions that are being taken now because the union's being publicly vocal about their position and the way that they feel to be treated. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5367.735s">With</a>  that being said, Madam President, it sounds to me like you want to move on, so I'd be happy to rest my case.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5373.559s">I</a>  am more than happy to return to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5375.38s">There</a>  is a number of city staff who have been waiting patiently. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5377.902s">This</a>  is absolutely an important topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5379.623s">I</a>  also want to get to the staff who are on the agenda.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5381.484s">It's</a>  important to point out that the city staff is being paid to be here, and these people are here on their own, free will and volition as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5386.967s">I</a>  just want that to be clear.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5388.208s">And</a>  I chair the meeting, so do I have a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5391.57s">Do</a>  we want to stay in public participation? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5393.311s">Motion.</a> </p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5395.403s">Motion</a>  to suspend the rules and take 22500 and 22502.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5397.204s">Motion</a>  to take 22, the rules are suspended, so I'd like to take 2250.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5404.766s">Madam,</a>  can I request an amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5407.206s">Can</a>  we take paper 22-504?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5410.667s">Sure,</a>  I just know that my director, Director Hunt can't stay too long, so I wanted to make sure that we got to her.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5418.929s">That's</a>  fine, we can take it later, I just, the people here.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5427.443s">I'm</a>  more than happy to keep in public participation if people want to vote to keep them in public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5431.273s">I'm</a>  trying to give fair time to people who are also speaking on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5436.973s">And</a>  again, as chair, that's my purpose. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5439.194s">Councilor</a>  Collins, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5442.036s">Councilor</a>  Collins, do you wanna take 22-500? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5443.337s">500,</a>  502, and 504.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5443.577s">All</a>  right, so on the motion of Councilor Collins to take 22-500, 22-502, and 22-503, correct?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5448.981s">504</a>  was the last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5449.461s">504,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5449.701s">Second</a>  by... Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5450.602s">Vice</a>  President Paris, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5467.007s">I</a>  was opposed passes to two dash five zero zero offered by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5475.091s">Here's</a>  all the the Medford City Council receive an update on the solid waste task force the forthcoming request for proposals from waste haulers as well as an upcoming opportunities for residents to learn more about the waste disposal contract negotiation and give feedback Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5488.83s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5490.591s">I've</a>  been enjoying serving on the Solid Waste Task Force so far this season. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5495.114s">We</a>  have some exciting opportunities for resident and business feedback on the work that we're doing, and Director Hunt is here tonight to share more information that my fellow Councilors and residents should know about the work ahead on re-evaluating the solid waste hauling contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5512.467s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5515.237s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Holmes. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5515.857s">Is</a>  there any councilors would like to speak on this before we see a presentation from director? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5519.239s">Do</a>  you need me to?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5523.161s">I</a>  raised my hand on the zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5524.742s">It's</a>  the one that's raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5526.063s">Yeah,</a>  that's and then I can I have just a very few just to serve slides.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5531.065s">Yeah,</a>  I think so. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5532.206s">If</a>  Shane, if you could make the planning development with the hand raised a co host so that they can share.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5544.656s">So</a>  I will be very brief, but we have information we'd like to update the council on, and that we would like for the public to be aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5553.98s">So</a>  I thank you, Councilor Collins, for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5558.022s">And</a>  I appreciate taking me out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5559.983s">I'm</a>  here this evening, I have actually injured my back, so I can't actually sit while I'm waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5565.486s">So</a>  I appreciate not having to be here all evening.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5578.108s">Or</a>  change.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5585.333s">So</a>  you should be able to share now.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5599.361s">Share</a>  this. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5600.822s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5608.252s">There</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5609.573s">So</a>  I did want to share with the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5612.675s">We</a>  do have a solid waste task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5614.416s">It</a>  was advertised to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5616.478s">We</a>  asked for volunteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5619.34s">This</a>  task force is being co-chaired by myself and Tim McGivern, the Commissioner of Public Works, who is on the call as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5626.705s">We</a>  are being very wonderfully supported by a graduate student, Madeline Levine. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5632.589s">Actually,</a>  her summer work was supported by a fellowship from Harvard, and now we are paying her <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5637.973s">with</a>  city funds this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5640.395s">And</a>  I list before you the members of the task force. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5645.077s">We</a>  just wanted people to be aware that our current hauler is waste management and that contract's ending soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5651.501s">We</a>  really, this is the right time to understand our waste services, what needs to change. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5657.825s">Basically,</a>  the world has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5660.007s">Trash</a>  has changed, recycling has changed, and the residents have changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5663.912s">And</a>  so we need to know what people would like to see in trash services. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5669.154s">We</a>  are doing public outreach this fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5672.475s">We</a>  have to do this relatively quickly, because it takes haulers a very long time to get up to speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5679.819s">Any</a>  waste company that would take over this contract if it wasn't waste management would need to purchase trucks, and those take a very long time to purchase to procure and bring online, and they would need to hire staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5692.969s">And</a>  then at the same time I want the council to know now. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5696.712s">that</a>  the contract will need to be for a good number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5701.374s">We're</a>  not committing to that number at this point, but more than three. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5705.536s">So</a>  we're gonna need city council approval because those trucks have to be amortized over the life of the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5711.519s">And</a>  the shorter your contract is, the higher the rates you pay because they're amortizing the cost of those trucks, which are their biggest, biggest expense. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5721.343s">I'm</a>  expecting that number to be somewhere between seven and 10 years that we're gonna ask for a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5726.366s">and</a>  I wanted the council to know that now. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5728.667s">Part</a>  of our plan is to, we have a survey now, we're gonna do public input now and then have some meetings in October and November and draft an RFP in the fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5738.491s">Before</a>  we release the RFP to the waste haulers, we'd like to bring it in front of city council so that you all are comfortable with the RFP that we're putting out such that when we get the bids back and negotiate with the contractor, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5754.058s">The</a>  council is ready to approve that contract, because you would have seen what it is it's in the RFP. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5760.703s">I'm</a>  not been aware of a process where the staff have brought an RFP to the council before we're bringing the actual contract the person who has bought it has wanted to negotiated contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5773.076s">to</a>  the council, but we think this will really help smooth the process later when we're negotiating with the waste haulers, we wanna feel more comfortable that the council is gonna be comfortable with this contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5786.812s">So</a>  what I really wanted to really be here tonight was to give you that information, as well as to make sure that everybody knows we wanna hear from everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5795.679s">Right</a>  now, we have a number of, we have a business survey that's out. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5799.602s">We</a>  only have 16 business responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5802.605s">We</a>  would really like to get more business responses. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5805.867s">We</a>  also have a residential survey out. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5808.109s">We</a>  have over 550 responses to our residential survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5812.023s">The</a>  survey is also available in five languages, the five languages that you typically see things from the city of Medford in. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5819.706s">So</a>  that survey is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5822.007s">If</a>  people are watching on TV or on their computer right now, this is a QR code. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5827.209s">You</a>  can take your phone. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5828.87s">You</a>  can open the camera on your phone and point it at that at the screen and your camera will pop up a little URL and you can click on it and go straight to the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5839.362s">So</a>  we want to make that available. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5840.883s">There's</a>  also the URL there is bit.ly slash Medford waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5847.68s">We</a>  also are gonna have a number of in-person locations where you can do the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5852.904s">It's</a>  always available from our office in City Hall from now until October 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5857.648s">We've</a>  had and will continue to have people at the farmer's market the next three weeks from three to 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5863.773s">We've</a>  had and will continue to have people at the public library on Saturday mornings. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5868.977s">And</a>  I will be actually myself at the Mystic River Festival with the survey and other sustainability <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5876.247s">planning</a>  information on September 24th from 12 to four. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5881.311s">And</a>  the other thing we want to convey to people is that our office has a newsletter. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5885.374s">We</a>  have 1700 people subscribed already. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5887.776s">We'd</a>  really like to add everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5890.258s">There</a>  are 58,000 people in the city of Medford, cut the children out. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5895.262s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5900.706s">I</a>  know that we're doing farmers markets, public library, no disrespect, but that's really, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5905.882s">That's</a>  one demographic, if you really look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5909.804s">Have</a>  we looked at doing the PTOs at the high school, where we have hundreds of parents going through? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5914.926s">Are</a>  we doing like the Mephiti football games? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5917.607s">We</a>  have hundreds of parents going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5919.648s">Are</a>  we looking at different events? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5920.868s">I</a>  mean, I understand whenever we do these surveys, I don't know if it's as visible to everybody else, but we keep doing it at the same places. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5930.891s">We</a>  keep doing these at the libraries, the farmers market. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5934.114s">There</a>  are other people in the community that are represented, but we're not going to them at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5938.459s">And</a>  I think that we should really take a hard look because this impacts our community, the whole community, not just this demographic, because it seems like that's all we're doing right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5950.01s">It's</a>  with tagging one part of the community we have to start looking at our when other communities do these outreach and I think it's very important this is this is a great step because we're seeing this is where I would like to see more public participation, more involvement but <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5967.975s">Why</a>  aren't we doing this more into the largest scheme scheme of it that the public schools when they're doing different meetings that, that, that, you know, the, the big athletic events in the city, you know, the, the, the big road race this weekend we're having hundreds of people this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5986.508s">Why</a>  wouldn't we be doing things like that I mean the mystic rest of the river festival September. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5992.194s">Yeah,</a>  that's the same people that go to library and say people that will see at the farmers market. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=5998.34s">So</a>  we have broadened, you know, our outreach here. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6002.765s">Let's</a>  look at Sunday we're gonna have hundreds of people running a city wide road race. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6006.729s">Well</a>  let's look. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6007.79s">I'd</a>  like to see that if we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6009.271s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6010.055s">So</a>  I appreciate the input, it is really helpful to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6013.117s">We</a>  have, our committee has been suggesting locations and volunteering themselves to go out. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6020.801s">Our</a>  staff are paid salaries, so they don't get paid overtime to go to all of these events. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6025.744s">Madeline</a>  is the only one who's hourly. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6027.985s">So</a>  we have been asking the committee to volunteer to be at some of these and to go to some of these events. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6035.069s">I'm</a>  happy to hear these ideas and we have been circulating them <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6038.391s">via</a>  email and on the web, that's how we have 550 responses already. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6042.873s">It</a>  has been circulating to some of these groups.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6045.534s">It's</a>  not a lot of residents in the city of Mexico, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6048.515s">500</a>  is not a lot.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6049.596s">It's</a>  a good number for some of us.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6050.976s">I</a>  don't disagree, but I guarantee it's the 550 people that do all the surveys. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6055.798s">We</a>  need to start reaching out to a greater scheme, a greater number, because this is a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6062.681s">And</a>  you can see it, this is a big, people don't realize how huge <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6067.723s">this</a>  negotiation is exactly what it entails. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6070.265s">So</a>  I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6072.227s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6073.268s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6077.272s">When</a>  does this contract expire?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6080.134s">The</a>  contract expires next summer, June 30.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6086.7s">6</a>  of 23? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6087.721s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6088.682s">And</a>  my last question is, <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6091.102s">Why</a>  are we negotiating with companies that don't have equipment? <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6094.503s">Why</a>  are we negotiating with companies that don't have equipment that have to go out and buy it?</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6100.364s">So</a>  there are only three waste haulers in this area that are large enough to service the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6105.986s">Any</a>  one of them typically only owns the vehicles that they need to service their current clients. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6111.528s">And</a>  when they take on a new client, they then obtain the vehicles and hire the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6115.929s">So</a>  they don't have these extra vehicles sitting around.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6118.449s">How</a>  many trucks are needed to <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6121.01s">support</a>  and benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6122.031s">I</a>  don't know that number. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6122.811s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6123.012s">Okay,</a>  so we're in the worst time to hire people. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6127.535s">We</a>  can't hire people to do anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/M203rzS4cvE&t=6129.537s">And</a>  we're looking at companies that don't have people and don't have trucks.</p>
