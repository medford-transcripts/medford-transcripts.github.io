1
00:04:52,029 --> 00:04:52,089
I'm

2
00:08:31,903 --> 00:08:31,983
do

3
00:08:43,442 --> 00:08:45,903
Good evening, everyone.

4
00:08:46,603 --> 00:08:52,726
My name is Terry E. Carter, and I direct elder services here at the West Medford Community Center.

5
00:08:52,786 --> 00:08:55,907
I want to talk a little bit about the building that you're in.

6
00:08:57,248 --> 00:09:02,710
West Medford is the historic African-American community in Medford.

7
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,432
And this building, this is actually the second building on the site, is

8
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:12,416
and has been probably the centerpiece of the community.

9
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:18,921
You see on the top row a bunch of older folks.

10
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:21,824
Those are the West Medford Elder Photo Project.

11
00:09:22,524 --> 00:09:29,270
Then on the lower portion of the wall, what you see is the West Medford Afro-American Remembrance Project.

12
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:48,516
and there's some interesting connections because we have folks from Brandeis here and actually it was a professor from Tufts and a professor from Brandeis that actually got together with folks in the community and with the genesis of this history project that rings the community center at this point.

13
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:51,997
So we had a great night last night.

14
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:57,639
We were actually outside and the only thing that it wasn't was warm, but it was

15
00:09:58,655 --> 00:10:00,177
you know, the jazz was stirring.

16
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:15,611
I'm the Poet Laureate of Medford, Massachusetts, so with Jonathan Fagan, Greg Toro, and John Dalton, we're the Ally Project, and so we were the second act to go on last night, and then we had

17
00:10:16,272 --> 00:10:20,198
Beacon Blues Band, which was fantastic.

18
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:25,225
So it was just a great night of music, and we expect much the same tonight.

19
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:29,392
So don't fret about the fact that the seats aren't all filled.

20
00:10:30,053 --> 00:10:30,974
It is what it is.

21
00:10:31,835 --> 00:10:34,038
But we will make masks optional.

22
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:42,088
I envisioned a room full of folks and wanted to make sure that everyone would be comfortable, which is why we put the mask mandate on.

23
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:47,234
But if you're comfortable and you want to take the mask off, then feel free to do that.

24
00:10:51,954 --> 00:10:57,039
founder and the major domo of the Medford Jazz Festival.

25
00:10:57,319 --> 00:10:59,101
He's my friend.

26
00:10:59,602 --> 00:11:05,568
He is a pianist, a composer, an arranger, a band leader, and a teacher.

27
00:11:06,148 --> 00:11:09,732
And we've been making some beautiful music together.

28
00:11:10,092 --> 00:11:13,796
So with no further ado, Mr. Jonathan Fagan.

29
00:11:18,564 --> 00:11:19,327
Thank you, Terry.

30
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:24,227
So first of all, just a couple more people to thank, first of which is Terry, actually.

31
00:11:25,956 --> 00:11:32,400
for really facilitating this entire partnership between the Jazz Festival and the West Medford Community Center.

32
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,381
We could not have done this without their support.

33
00:11:35,302 --> 00:11:45,508
And I really can't think of anywhere better to do it because, again, as he was saying, it's such an iconic space, and there's so much history here that was just perfect for his poetry.

34
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:51,492
And I think you're gonna enjoy, well, both what this group, Dakota's Trio, and what Leo Blanco is gonna play later.

35
00:11:52,993 --> 00:11:57,817
A couple of other sponsors that definitely need to be mentioned.

36
00:11:57,877 --> 00:11:59,779
First of all, our loyal Patreon supporters.

37
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:05,203
These are people that just put a couple dollars in every month, and they really allow us to do things like this.

38
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:15,072
They're the reason that we were able to sustain our monthly jam session series here, which I think a couple, as I'm looking, a couple of you have been there before.

39
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:23,535
It's a great opportunity for professional musicians to network and then also for students to get to play with some people that they wouldn't get to play with otherwise.

40
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:31,338
To the Mystic River Watershed Association, which really stepped in and made this feasible for us towards the last minute.

41
00:12:32,979 --> 00:12:38,501
To the Arts Alive Foundation, which is headed by the great Mae Marbeck, they fund so many great

42
00:12:39,715 --> 00:12:44,616
arts initiatives across the city to the Medford Arts Council for their continued support.

43
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:57,180
I always joke that this festival started four years ago in my friend's laundromat with the help of the Medford Arts Council, and they've really been, you know, just a steady, steady force through this whole thing.

44
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,801
And I'm trying to think, am I forgetting anybody?

45
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:04,227
I'm having one of those moments.

46
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:06,688
Oh, and Caché, thank you.

47
00:13:07,168 --> 00:13:10,930
Caché Medford, which is another organization that's helped us to promote all of this.

48
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:16,313
And the Medford Community Media, who's doing all of the streaming for us tonight.

49
00:13:16,413 --> 00:13:18,014
So thank you very much to them.

50
00:13:18,634 --> 00:13:22,016
And thank you to our viewers online, too, at this point.

51
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:26,238
I looked at just a little bit of the stream from last night, and it was fantastic.

52
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:28,640
Thank you also to Audient Sound Company, who's

53
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:36,102
done a lot to make this sound as good as it does now, and hopefully, well, it'll sound better when I'm not talking.

54
00:13:36,763 --> 00:13:38,843
So, there you go.

55
00:13:39,303 --> 00:13:47,166
So, it's my pleasure to introduce Dakota and, well, I called them the Brandeis University Trio, but I understand since that they've come up with a better name.

56
00:13:47,186 --> 00:13:50,667
Or Dakota and... Dakota and the rest of us.

57
00:13:53,254 --> 00:13:53,694
There we go.

58
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:57,215
It's what happens when you put these musicians together.

59
00:13:57,255 --> 00:14:07,897
No, but seriously, Dakota's one of those students that within about 10 minutes of our first lesson together, I got a pretty strong sense that she would be doing some special stuff in the first couple years.

60
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:11,377
And here she is, and I am sure there's more in store very soon.

61
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:14,418
So I'll turn it over to them.

62
00:14:15,318 --> 00:14:18,999
And well, do you want to say, I'll let you do your thing.

63
00:21:39,016 --> 00:21:41,639
Hello, that was Sweet Pumpkin.

64
00:21:44,361 --> 00:21:44,902
Who wrote it?

65
00:21:45,382 --> 00:21:48,085
Ronald Bright, Dr. Ronald Bright.

66
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:52,869
I actually got that song from Samara Joy, really good vocal jazz singer.

67
00:21:52,889 --> 00:22:03,420
Okay, well on the bass, we have my jazz director, advisor, guidance, Bob Neske.

68
00:22:09,342 --> 00:22:11,003
On the drums, we have Gordon.

69
00:22:11,023 --> 00:22:14,144
My new friend.

70
00:22:14,204 --> 00:22:14,865
My new friend.

71
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:17,146
Okay.

72
00:22:17,266 --> 00:22:22,848
So next tune, we are playing Let's Cool One, Thelonious Monk.

73
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:24,169
Very fun tune.

74
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:25,029
Yeah.

75
00:22:52,654 --> 00:22:52,716
you

76
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,031
do do

77
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:10,242
uh

78
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:22,767
The next number we're going to do is Polka Dots and Moonbeams.

79
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:27,328
Featuring Bob on the bass playing the melody.

80
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:30,462
Trying not to make it a melody.

81
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:07,094
Bye!

82
00:33:21,534 --> 00:33:21,695
do

83
00:33:58,763 --> 00:33:59,023
do

84
00:34:39,397 --> 00:34:40,598
do do

85
00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:13,014
you

86
00:35:49,059 --> 00:36:05,809
The next tune is a great standard called I've Never Been In Love Before.

87
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:14,574
Is that good?

88
00:36:14,594 --> 00:36:15,215
One, two, one, two.

89
00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:20,436
do

90
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:07,876
Bye.

91
00:41:54,987 --> 00:42:03,033
Um, our final tune for tonight is Spain, dedicated to Chick Corea, who is from this area, I'm pretty sure.

92
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:07,237
Well, that's in the area from Massachusetts.

93
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:09,939
Um, yeah, okay.

94
00:42:09,959 --> 00:42:17,525
Okay, cool.

95
00:42:17,545 --> 00:42:17,765
Okay.

96
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,205
Alright, cool.

97
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:27,747
Yeah, it's you first.

98
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:06,949
Bye!

99
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:15,531
do

100
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:47,902
do

101
00:49:04,554 --> 00:49:06,075
Gordon Engelgau on the drums.

102
00:49:08,216 --> 00:49:09,397
Bob Neske on bass.

103
00:49:10,778 --> 00:49:12,579
And of course, Dakota Lajow on the piano.

104
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:17,721
Dakota and the rest of us, as they like to say.

105
00:49:18,222 --> 00:49:18,602
All right.

106
00:49:18,943 --> 00:49:20,284
So we're going to take a quick break.

107
00:49:21,165 --> 00:49:23,447
Please take advantage of the restrooms.

108
00:49:24,007 --> 00:49:25,329
We have a water fountain over here.

109
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:33,797
I believe we have some more hot cider and coffee in the back over there, and then also snacks available for purchase.

110
00:49:33,877 --> 00:49:40,043
So we're just going to take about 10, 15 minutes, swap out keyboards and some cymbals, and then we'll be right back with Leo Blanco.

111
00:50:30,555 --> 00:50:30,618
you

112
00:51:08,217 --> 00:51:15,078
Okay, so if you are interested in refreshments, they're actually being dispensed in the kitchen.

113
00:51:15,538 --> 00:51:27,201
So as you go out toward the outside door, the first room on your right is the kitchen, there's coffee, there's hot water for tea, there's a hot apple cider, and then there's a bunch of different snacks.

114
00:51:27,261 --> 00:51:34,922
So it's nothing too expensive, but something to nosh on and something to have a little beverage.

115
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:39,533
you

116
00:52:39,375 --> 00:52:39,515
do

117
00:53:30,987 --> 00:53:31,687
do do do

118
00:54:01,523 --> 00:54:01,604
do

119
00:54:39,327 --> 00:54:39,527
do

120
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:45,110
do

121
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:13,934
do do

122
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:46,340
Bye!

123
01:04:15,372 --> 01:04:16,392
do do

124
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:14,894
But anyways, it's my distinct pleasure to introduce Leo Blanco and his trio.

125
01:06:16,095 --> 01:06:18,496
These guys are just amazing musicians.

126
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:32,767
Leo has been at Berklee for many, many years, is an established composer and educator, and has just recently come out with another CD, which, with a violinist, I think you were saying that you brought a different one tonight.

127
01:06:32,787 --> 01:06:36,570
Africa Latina.

128
01:06:39,005 --> 01:06:39,266
Thank you.

129
01:07:16,613 --> 01:07:18,715
The part in the center has to go at the bottom to make it solid.

130
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:19,055
Yeah.

131
01:07:19,075 --> 01:07:19,296
Oh, yeah.

132
01:07:19,336 --> 01:07:28,225
And if you touch the part in the center, it'll be very dirty.

133
01:07:28,245 --> 01:07:28,765
Yeah, I've done that.

134
01:07:28,785 --> 01:07:29,126
It's not dirty.

135
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:29,486
Yeah.

136
01:07:29,506 --> 01:07:33,670
Any drummer knows that.

137
01:07:53,814 --> 01:07:56,436
As long as there's not an earthquake, I think we'll be okay.

138
01:08:30,836 --> 01:08:30,957
you.

139
01:09:07,785 --> 01:09:08,005
Yes.

140
01:09:08,425 --> 01:09:09,426
Hello, people online.

141
01:09:09,446 --> 01:09:11,808
Hello to my son.

142
01:09:12,488 --> 01:09:14,910
He's online all the time.

143
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:20,513
So, yeah, I'll introduce the tunes by, as we go.

144
01:09:21,053 --> 01:09:29,639
The first one is one inspired on all the influence we have in South American countries by the Arab world, Middle East world.

145
01:09:30,559 --> 01:09:32,421
Not many people talk about that influence.

146
01:09:32,681 --> 01:09:33,942
Everybody talks about the influence

147
01:09:34,842 --> 01:09:40,406
Europe, Africa, of course, and indigenous that was almost lost, wiped out.

148
01:09:41,727 --> 01:09:48,232
But through, I guess, through Spain, we got a lot of influence from, from the Arab world.

149
01:09:48,593 --> 01:09:53,376
Spain itself was invaded for eight centuries by, by, by Arabs.

150
01:09:54,037 --> 01:09:54,978
And when they,

151
01:09:55,778 --> 01:10:19,856
spell them out after eight centuries, many of them were persecuted and many of them embarked to South America because it was easy to escape and so it kind of was under the table on the records, but we actually have a lot of Arab words in Spanish, like for example, ohala, I wish, which is to Allah, right?

152
01:10:20,456 --> 01:10:21,258
if God wants.

153
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:31,519
So this one is called Azul de Manicuare and it's inspired on the Arab influence in the Americas, especially in South America.

154
01:10:31,559 --> 01:10:31,780
Thank you.

155
01:11:24,325 --> 01:11:25,806
do do do

156
01:16:34,428 --> 01:16:34,508
do

157
01:19:31,630 --> 01:19:31,971
do

158
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:22,551
Thank you.

159
01:22:24,475 --> 01:22:25,497
Yes, all right, thank you.

160
01:22:25,597 --> 01:22:26,760
That was Azul.

161
01:22:27,602 --> 01:22:31,991
Let's continue with one called Colors of South.

162
01:22:38,231 --> 01:22:40,252
Sorry, have you gone crazy there?

163
01:22:40,792 --> 01:22:52,596
Before I continue, I have to introduce this wonderful team that really gets me inspired and rock and back me up and that, get me inspired all the time.

164
01:22:53,476 --> 01:22:55,937
On the drums, my friend Mark Walker.

165
01:22:58,908 --> 01:23:06,859
Mark Walker is just coming, returning from a tour with Arturo Sandoval all around the world, and now here in the city of Medford.

166
01:23:08,842 --> 01:23:09,744
You made it.

167
01:23:10,565 --> 01:23:14,170
Fernando Huergo from Argentina, my longtime friend, Fernando Huergo.

168
01:23:15,171 --> 01:23:15,472
Thank you.

169
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:44,834
do

170
01:31:10,741 --> 01:31:11,042
you

171
01:32:57,079 --> 01:32:58,043
Thank you, thank you very much.

172
01:32:58,083 --> 01:32:59,730
You see why I love playing with these guys.

173
01:33:00,990 --> 01:33:04,373
All right, I'm gonna turn it down a little bit.

174
01:33:04,613 --> 01:33:09,597
This is a composition called Waltz Number Five.

175
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:16,402
So I don't wanna get too technical musically speaking, but waltz is usually something in three, four.

176
01:33:18,184 --> 01:33:23,268
And I wrote this, which is in five, but it has that feeling of three.

177
01:33:24,008 --> 01:33:25,349
Anyway, you shouldn't be counting.

178
01:33:25,389 --> 01:33:26,911
Just sit back and enjoy.

179
01:33:27,471 --> 01:33:28,392
Let the counting for us.

180
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:32,069
Yeah, don't count on me.

181
01:37:19,383 --> 01:37:20,424
do do

182
01:37:47,804 --> 01:37:47,924
do

183
01:44:07,469 --> 01:44:08,150
Thank you very much.

184
01:44:08,170 --> 01:44:10,011
It's a pleasure to play for you.

185
01:44:13,394 --> 01:44:15,395
Let's go south to Peru.

186
01:44:16,636 --> 01:44:34,251
I was producing that album that Jonathan mentioned before, Africa Latina, because I was fascinated with all the heritage we got from Africa in different groups and groups that sometimes even people, inhabitants of those countries wouldn't even know about it, right?

187
01:44:34,671 --> 01:44:36,673
So for example, you know, when we talk about

188
01:44:38,433 --> 01:44:42,139
Andean countries of South America like Ecuador, Peru.

189
01:44:43,901 --> 01:44:51,472
Sometimes people don't even, are not even aware that there are African, African descendant people there, and a lot of, many of them.

190
01:44:52,682 --> 01:45:09,270
So many people don't know, have no idea, for example, that tango from Argentina, which is such an elitex and sexy dance and that they very much be loved in Europe, it comes actually from Africans living in Argentina, because believe it or not, there were a lot of Africans living in Argentina.

191
01:45:09,810 --> 01:45:13,993
And nowadays, it's like even difficult to see a black person in Argentina.

192
01:45:15,053 --> 01:45:16,794
They were all wiped out, basically.

193
01:45:17,799 --> 01:45:25,647
And in Ecuador, and Peru, and Bolivia, we see only black people in the World Cup, because they are part of the team.

194
01:45:25,847 --> 01:45:30,692
70, 80% part of the teams, of the soccer teams, are African descendant people from these countries.

195
01:45:31,372 --> 01:45:38,679
And they're not given opportunities to go into other type of jobs, so they go into art or sport.

196
01:45:39,780 --> 01:45:51,785
So anyway, with this research that I've been doing about African heritage in South America, I encountered these different rhythms from Peru that were not very well known at that time.

197
01:45:51,805 --> 01:45:53,265
And nowadays, it's different.

198
01:45:53,346 --> 01:45:55,126
Things have changed in a good way.

199
01:45:55,806 --> 01:45:58,167
And so this one is called Lando.

200
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:00,588
And it's called Peru Lando.

201
01:46:00,608 --> 01:46:03,730
The tune is based on a rhythm called Lando.

202
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:04,550
I hope you like it.

203
01:48:49,053 --> 01:48:49,353
do do

204
01:49:08,897 --> 01:49:09,137
do do

205
01:49:50,226 --> 01:49:50,407
do

206
01:50:44,531 --> 01:50:44,651
do

207
01:53:55,700 --> 01:54:00,562
So now we come back up in South America to my native country of Venezuela.

208
01:54:01,322 --> 01:54:04,163
Yeah, so before METFOR, my native country was Venezuela.

209
01:54:05,564 --> 01:54:13,386
So yeah, this, you'll hear a little bit of jazz and Venezuelan music on this tune.

210
01:54:13,406 --> 01:54:15,167
It's called Roots and Effect.

211
01:54:32,381 --> 01:54:32,443
you

212
01:55:35,293 --> 01:55:35,554

Thank you, thank you very much.

218
02:03:21,407 --> 02:03:22,708
It's been a blast.

219
02:03:23,048 --> 02:03:25,610
Just intimate, but nice vibe, right?

220
02:03:25,850 --> 02:03:27,351
That is what it's all about.

221
02:03:27,371 --> 02:03:28,572
It's all about, yes.

222
02:03:29,473 --> 02:03:30,734
Thank you very much for being here.

223
02:03:30,754 --> 02:03:32,155
We're gonna play the last tune now.

224
02:03:33,416 --> 02:03:36,758
But please, another round of applause for these incredible musicians.

Thank you, Jonathan, for inviting us, for creating this festival.

234
02:04:00,682 --> 02:04:02,404
Yeah, we need more culture.

235
02:04:02,865 --> 02:04:09,972
That's what makes communities strong, and the identity of the communities, too, the diversity, the identity and diversity, right?

236
02:04:12,255 --> 02:04:16,479
The last tune is the title of the album that Jonathan mentioned that is available there.

237
02:04:16,539 --> 02:04:18,361
It's called Africa Latina.

238

What a perfect way to end our festival for this year.

250
02:15:01,407 --> 02:15:06,552
Just before I let you go, I have to remind you that there is a donation jar over there on that table over there.

251
02:15:07,332 --> 02:15:11,875
That allows us to hire amazing musicians like this and to keep this festival going.
