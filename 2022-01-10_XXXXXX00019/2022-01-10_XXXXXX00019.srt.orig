1
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:06,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Mad for Bites listeners.

2
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:10,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's episode includes an interview with the Lakota Youth Stay.

3
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:14,918
[SPEAKER_02]: This project focuses on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.

4
00:00:15,838 --> 00:00:29,885
[SPEAKER_02]: My guests wanted me to mention that because it is often the incredible trauma associated with Pine Ridge, including the Massacret Wounded Knee, that is most focused on, our conversation today was intentional in celebrating the Native people on Pine Ridge.

5
00:00:31,225 --> 00:00:34,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanted to start today's episode with a land acknowledgement

6
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:37,975
[SPEAKER_02]: that was written for me by Joy Harris, one of today's guests.

7
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:41,998
[SPEAKER_02]: This podcast was recorded in the city of Medford, Massachusetts.

8
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:49,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Medford is located on the traditional ancestral homelands of the Massachusetts and Wampanoag peoples, past and present.

9
00:00:50,395 --> 00:00:58,440
[SPEAKER_02]: We acknowledge, honor, and respect their ongoing presence and deep and abiding connection with the land, water, plants, and animals.

10
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:06,346
[SPEAKER_02]: We thank them for their stewardship over many generations as they continue to protect this land and practice their traditions.

11
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:08,207
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you enjoy the interview.

12
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:17,628
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so thank you both so much for being here with me today.

13
00:01:18,169 --> 00:01:22,290
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could introduce yourselves and say your name and pronouns and anything else about yourself.

14
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:24,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

15
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:26,592
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks for having us.

16
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:29,333
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Joy Harris.

17
00:01:29,433 --> 00:01:32,054
[SPEAKER_01]: My pronouns are she and hers.

18
00:01:32,574 --> 00:01:40,337
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a resident of West Medford and a retired occupational therapist who has a

19
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:49,991
[SPEAKER_01]: long-standing interest in Native American culture and contemporary issues.

20
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,454
[SPEAKER_00]: And my name is Bruce Roberts.

21
00:01:53,694 --> 00:02:04,101
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Joy's spouse and he and him and I'm a retired psychologist and I also have a long-standing interest.

22
00:02:05,102 --> 00:02:12,508
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting one of the things that we found out after we met was of our the history of our interest in Native American.

23
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:12,848
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't

24
00:02:13,268 --> 00:02:19,752
[SPEAKER_00]: I was an English major undergraduate, for example, and I remember taking a number of independent studies in Native American literature.

25
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,275
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could both go pretty far back in that direction.

26
00:02:26,295 --> 00:02:34,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think that the interest in Native American culture and history is something that will be kind of our primary focus in the work that you all are doing today.

27
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:43,025
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, if we could start with a question that I ask everybody that I interview is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there?

28
00:02:44,783 --> 00:02:47,124
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, this is pretty easy for me.

29
00:02:48,325 --> 00:02:51,766
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like Snappy Patties, which is right down the street from us.

30
00:02:52,086 --> 00:02:54,247
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love their fish tacos.

31
00:02:54,968 --> 00:03:01,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have tried to have fish tacos in a number of different countries and restaurants.

32
00:03:01,951 --> 00:03:05,093
[SPEAKER_01]: And Snappy Patties is the best.

33
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:06,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

34
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:10,735
[SPEAKER_00]: I say my favorite restaurant is Bistro 5.

35
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:14,417
[SPEAKER_00]: And you really can't go wrong with anything in there.

36
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:16,305
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also right down the street from us.

37
00:03:16,345 --> 00:03:18,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that's why it's a favorite.

38
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,952
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like everything on their menu, actually.

39
00:03:21,513 --> 00:03:23,657
[SPEAKER_00]: The cheeseburgers are good if you just want to get in and out.

40
00:03:24,518 --> 00:03:28,865
[SPEAKER_00]: And they always have something new on the menu if you want to sit down for a nice dinner.

41
00:03:29,493 --> 00:03:29,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Delicious.

42
00:03:30,113 --> 00:03:30,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, awesome.

43
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:31,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

44
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:33,236
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are hyper local, then.

45
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:33,936
[SPEAKER_02]: So Westman.

46
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:35,797
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

47
00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:42,042
[SPEAKER_02]: So I you know, I think you are both here to talk about your work with Lakota Youth Stay.

48
00:03:42,082 --> 00:03:45,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't mind kind of describing that program, telling us a little bit about it.

49
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:48,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

50
00:03:50,263 --> 00:04:01,888
[SPEAKER_01]: The Lakota Youth Stay Program is a summer home stay program for the Lakota youth on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota.

51
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:16,915
[SPEAKER_01]: And the purpose or the mission of the program is to build sustainable, mutual, rewarding friendships between people in Medford or in the greater Medford area.

52
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:46,335
[SPEAKER_01]: and the Native American youth on Pine Ridge and their families with the purpose, I guess, of creating opportunities for the youth to see what life is like off the reservation and also to generate cultural awareness for families in the greater Medford area about Native history, about culture, and about contemporary issues and life on the reservation.

53
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:59,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And the program started as a result of our trips, our volunteer trips out to the reservation starting in 2012.

54
00:05:00,722 --> 00:05:09,969
[SPEAKER_01]: We started going out there with a group of people from Medford to do building projects on the reservation and

55
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,387
[SPEAKER_01]: which was an incredible experience.

56
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:19,170
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been going ever since then with different groups of people.

57
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,513
[SPEAKER_01]: And that really sort of awakened our interest in Native history.

58
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:35,798
[SPEAKER_01]: And from those experiences, we had the idea of starting sort of like a student exchange program or homestay program.

59
00:05:36,398 --> 00:05:39,460
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started working on that in 2015 and it sort of grew from there.

60
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything you would add, Bruce?

61
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:53,246
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would add for folks that don't know too much about the Pine Ridge Reservation, it's in the southwest corner of South Dakota.

62
00:05:54,847 --> 00:06:03,813
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the poorest reservations in the United States, but also one of the poorest counties.

63
00:06:04,453 --> 00:06:10,438
[SPEAKER_00]: It annually vows for either, vies for either first or second poorest county in the country.

64
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:11,959
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's large, it's a large,

65
00:06:13,882 --> 00:06:20,663
[SPEAKER_00]: The 35,000 people that live there on a reservation about two-thirds the size of Connecticut.

66
00:06:22,264 --> 00:06:23,744
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's large and spread out.

67
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:28,985
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, 35,000 is just over half of the people that we have in Medford.

68
00:06:30,105 --> 00:06:32,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine that spread over an area that big?

69
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:33,925
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fairly rural.

70
00:06:34,926 --> 00:06:35,886
[SPEAKER_00]: It's beautiful.

71
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:42,887
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of diversity in terms of the landscape out there, but extreme poverty and there are lots of demographic

72
00:06:44,798 --> 00:06:48,541
[SPEAKER_00]: facts about the reservation that are kind of chilling.

73
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:51,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to talk about some of those, Joy?

74
00:06:51,403 --> 00:06:51,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

75
00:06:52,985 --> 00:07:04,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Pine Ridge is frequently cited as the sort of poster reservation, I guess, for those chilling statistics.

76
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:08,317
[SPEAKER_01]: But the annual per capita income is somewhere around $7,000 a year.

77
00:07:12,493 --> 00:07:14,954
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a very high unemployment rate.

78
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:16,214
[SPEAKER_01]: It's around 85, 90%.

79
00:07:16,274 --> 00:07:32,937
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a big issue with alcoholism and now even with meth distribution on the reservation and somewhere around 96, 97% of the families live below the poverty level.

80
00:07:36,178 --> 00:07:38,739
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the high school dropout rate is somewhere around 75%.

81
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,691
[SPEAKER_01]: That might have gone down a little bit recently.

82
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:55,641
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a number of I think 35 or 38% of the households don't have electricity or an indoor plumbing, which was really shocking to us when we went out there.

83
00:07:55,661 --> 00:08:00,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I've traveled quite a bit to third world countries and

84
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:10,477
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I always thought, well, at least everyone in the United States has electricity and running water until we went out to Pine Ridge and found out that that's not the case.

85
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:20,624
[SPEAKER_01]: And the healthcare, they have the Indian Health Services, but it's really for acute sort of emergency situations.

86
00:08:20,784 --> 00:08:24,467
[SPEAKER_01]: And so their healthcare isn't great either.

87
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:30,211
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of- And once again, we could just say there's one hospital on Pine Ridge,

88
00:08:31,109 --> 00:08:48,523
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could imagine something almost the size of Connecticut with only one hospital and folks generally don't have the same transportation opportunities we have here, they don't have mass transit there and not every family has access to a vehicle.

89
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:54,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So the healthcare, health concerns generally are a big issue on the reservation.

90
00:08:56,309 --> 00:09:00,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they have high rates of diabetes and heart conditions.

91
00:09:02,005 --> 00:09:14,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one of the other things we discovered when we started going out there is the food desert that sort of a food desert there's really only one grocery store in an area that's almost the size of Connecticut.

92
00:09:16,237 --> 00:09:18,258
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and the grocery store is pretty small.

93
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:27,461
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually improved in the last couple of years, but sort of access to fresh food is an issue on the reservation.

94
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:34,244
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of processed food, which over a long-term leads to a lot of health disparities.

95
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:37,185
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say that

96
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:45,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the time, so it's been almost 10 years since we've been going there, we have seen a lot of really positive changes on the reservation.

97
00:09:46,046 --> 00:09:51,110
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more people doing gardening and growing fresh vegetables.

98
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:57,794
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more access, especially during COVID, because of the funds that have come in.

99
00:09:57,834 --> 00:10:00,376
[SPEAKER_01]: There's better access to some health care.

100
00:10:02,282 --> 00:10:06,325
[SPEAKER_01]: We see more kids staying in school and graduating from high school.

101
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:09,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And the land out there is absolutely beautiful.

102
00:10:09,668 --> 00:10:13,451
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we go out there and it's just like a breath of fresh air.

103
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:28,924
[SPEAKER_01]: Going out there, it's very different from the Northeast because you have your wide open expanses and it's just a beautiful, beautiful place with a interesting, fascinating history.

104
00:10:29,885 --> 00:10:34,608
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we go out there, we really just enjoy it so much.

105
00:10:34,808 --> 00:10:44,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that we've met on the reservation are very welcoming after a while, after you get to know them a little bit.

106
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:56,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And so over the years, we've developed some really great friendships with people out there that we've met and with the youth that have participated in the program and their families.

107
00:10:57,108 --> 00:11:00,711
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine there's like a process of like trust building, right?

108
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:02,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Where like, you know, you're getting to know each other.

109
00:11:02,792 --> 00:11:07,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine some sort of element of understanding the culture.

110
00:11:08,296 --> 00:11:09,837
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that process like for you?

111
00:11:10,697 --> 00:11:12,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there was a process.

112
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:14,940
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we started going out there in 2012, you know, went every year.

113
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,662
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in 2015, when we were out there, there had been a

114
00:11:24,888 --> 00:11:28,933
[SPEAKER_01]: increase in the number of youth suicides that particular winter.

115
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:37,183
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we were out there, there was definitely a sense of sadness and throughout the reservation.

116
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:42,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were talking with some young people out there about this.

117
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:47,956
[SPEAKER_01]: And just sort of brainstorming really, like, you know, what could be done?

118
00:11:47,996 --> 00:11:52,319
[SPEAKER_01]: What could you know, as people that live in Boston, like, how can we help?

119
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:53,140
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we do?

120
00:11:54,001 --> 00:12:00,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And we started talking about sort of student exchange programs, and whether there was anything like that on the reservation.

121
00:12:01,566 --> 00:12:06,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And the youth that we were talking to, just got really excited about something like that.

122
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,392
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, many families don't have

123
00:12:11,328 --> 00:12:25,336
[SPEAKER_01]: the ability to leave the reservation that often, or if they do, it's to go to Rapid City where there's a Walmart and things like that where they can get reasonably priced food.

124
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:34,662
[SPEAKER_01]: The youth got very excited about this, so we started talking more and more, and that's how we got the idea to start this program.

125
00:12:35,182 --> 00:12:39,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there was a period of time where I think showing up every year,

126
00:12:41,755 --> 00:12:49,782
[SPEAKER_01]: and going out to different families' homes and talking to them about the program and also getting their feedback.

127
00:12:50,482 --> 00:12:53,284
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what would make sense?

128
00:12:53,505 --> 00:12:55,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what would you feel comfortable with?

129
00:12:56,067 --> 00:13:04,253
[SPEAKER_01]: That, I think, went a long way to sort of creating a sense of mutual trust, you know, with the families.

130
00:13:06,044 --> 00:13:08,325
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really worked on the program starting in 2015.

131
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:22,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had the first group of youth, we had 10 youth come in 2017 to Medford for a week.

132
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:30,652
[SPEAKER_01]: And we also had a lot of work to do on the Medford side in terms of introducing the program and

133
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,500
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to families here about hosting opportunities.

134
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:43,305
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went to different families' houses and talked to them about our experience and what we wanted to do.

135
00:13:43,325 --> 00:13:52,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And that first year, I think we had seven families sign up to host the youth from Pine Ridge.

136
00:13:56,197 --> 00:13:56,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

137
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:59,199
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, you know, that's a whole process and matching up.

138
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:02,862
[SPEAKER_01]: We really tried to do it on a very individual basis.

139
00:14:02,982 --> 00:14:14,751
[SPEAKER_01]: So really getting to know the kids on the reservation and what they were interested in and what their personalities were like, and then trying to match them up with a family that would be a good match.

140
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:24,159
[SPEAKER_01]: So we spent a lot of time doing that and we were very open and we were always going back to people on the reservation and saying, how do you feel about this?

141
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:26,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think this is a good idea?

142
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:32,416
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a number of Lakota adults who were on our advisory board.

143
00:14:33,036 --> 00:14:40,100
[SPEAKER_01]: So we really sought their input the whole entire way and continue to do so.

144
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,042
[SPEAKER_01]: How old were the group of kids?

145
00:14:43,402 --> 00:14:44,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how old are they generally?

146
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:46,143
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

147
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:49,525
[SPEAKER_01]: So our program is for kids 10 to 15 years old.

148
00:14:52,676 --> 00:14:55,178
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say the average age is somewhere around 12.

149
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:10,070
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of the reason we did that is that I guess one of our goals is we really want the kids to stay in school and graduate from high school.

150
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:15,875
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just thought, you know, working with younger kids and giving them the opportunity to

151
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:22,099
[SPEAKER_01]: see what life is like off the reservation, that maybe that would be an inspiration for them.

152
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:29,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they would discover something of interest to them that they would want to study in school.

153
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:37,744
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we went with the younger group and it really has worked out very well having the younger kids come.

154
00:15:40,127 --> 00:15:44,390
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do try and match them up with families that have kids around the same age.

155
00:15:46,331 --> 00:15:54,377
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have had host families that either their children are grown or they don't have kids.

156
00:15:54,457 --> 00:16:01,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually when that is the case, then we have two Lakota youth stay with a family together so that they're comfortable.

157
00:16:04,383 --> 00:16:06,445
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really worked out very well.

158
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:21,476
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like so part of the goal is like giving them an experience outside of the reservation to maybe build some sense of like hope or different options or just to sort of expand what they're seeing every day.

159
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:33,642
[SPEAKER_02]: And is the intention to sort of give them an option that is like leaving the reservation or is there some piece about like how like bringing things back home or, you know?

160
00:16:34,023 --> 00:16:34,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

161
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:37,158
[SPEAKER_00]: PB, David Ensign --"That's a good question."

162
00:16:37,178 --> 00:16:38,738
[SPEAKER_01]: PB, Sarah Silver--"Yes.

163
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:44,321
[SPEAKER_01]: No, our intention is not for them to leave the reservation unless that's something that they want to do.

164
00:16:46,601 --> 00:16:53,844
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, our idea was that the youth would stay in school, possibly go to college.

165
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:55,265
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we do

166
00:16:56,104 --> 00:16:59,186
[SPEAKER_01]: is we do take them on a tour of a college campus.

167
00:16:59,526 --> 00:17:01,827
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get to meet some students.

168
00:17:01,907 --> 00:17:07,490
[SPEAKER_01]: They get to hear about scholarship opportunities available to Native youth.

169
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,431
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we talk about that.

170
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:14,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a Navajo woman that does the tours with us.

171
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:18,475
[SPEAKER_01]: And she talks about her experience in terms of going to school.

172
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:24,298
[SPEAKER_01]: So our idea really is to give the youth a sense of hope and that they

173
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:43,074
[SPEAKER_01]: can have whatever sort of future that they want and that there's opportunities to further their education so that they can bring some of those, that knowledge and skills back to the reservation and over time sort of implement change on the reservation for the families there.

174
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:50,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other piece of this is that when we started going out to the reservation and came back,

175
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,182
[SPEAKER_01]: talked with people in our community about our experience.

176
00:17:56,142 --> 00:18:05,067
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, there were, there were a number of people that was sort of surprised that there were reservations still on the in the country and even that

177
00:18:05,646 --> 00:18:09,048
[SPEAKER_01]: surprised that there were still native people in this country.

178
00:18:09,128 --> 00:18:28,521
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was part of our idea was to create that awareness and our own community about native history and about contemporary life on a reservation, and really to highlight all the positive aspects of that.

179
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:31,983
[SPEAKER_01]: So it wasn't just about

180
00:18:32,842 --> 00:18:35,383
[SPEAKER_01]: creating opportunities for the youth on the reservation.

181
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:47,306
[SPEAKER_01]: It was also equally important to us to create awareness of native life and history for families here in the greater Medford community.

182
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:58,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, on the flip side there, a lot of the kids that came out from the reservation were not really aware that there were still Native Americans on the East Coast.

183
00:18:58,969 --> 00:19:01,830
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were very surprised we were able to arrange

184
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:12,617
[SPEAKER_00]: day trips down to Mashpee to spend time with the Wampanoag tribe who actually welcomed them.

185
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:19,361
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got to go to a council meeting and they held a little mini powwow for the kids.

186
00:19:19,421 --> 00:19:24,443
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were right at home, right away with the native kids here.

187
00:19:25,084 --> 00:19:26,044
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was interesting.

188
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:30,666
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there may be some persisting correspondence that goes on between some of those kids.

189
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:35,877
[SPEAKER_00]: from Massachusetts back to South Dakota.

190
00:19:36,277 --> 00:19:36,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

191
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:49,686
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like a very thoughtful plan that you've come up with for how to sort of give exposure to different things while also kind of helping to create a space here that they can feel accepted and normalized.

192
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:54,889
[SPEAKER_02]: What have been some of the challenges that you've noticed in doing this?

193
00:19:57,872 --> 00:20:01,613
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, COVID's been a huge challenge.

194
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:12,075
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the last two years have been a huge challenge because we had a group of 11 youth that were scheduled to come here in 2020.

195
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:18,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Very excited, you know, to come and we had to cancel that program.

196
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:21,917
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we had to cancel it again this year, this past year.

197
00:20:22,017 --> 00:20:22,337
[SPEAKER_00]: So.

198
00:20:22,797 --> 00:20:23,537
[SPEAKER_00]: You think about it.

199
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,858
[SPEAKER_00]: The families don't want their kids to go across the country to

200
00:20:27,948 --> 00:20:29,810
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID during a COVID infestation.

201
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:39,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And likewise, host families here didn't want to be bringing somebody in that they weren't, they didn't really know, and couldn't be sure of the health status of them.

202
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:43,761
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was, we didn't have a choice, really.

203
00:20:44,902 --> 00:20:51,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, like a lot of organizations, you know, it really, it really affected us.

204
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:53,669
[SPEAKER_01]: And we

205
00:20:54,500 --> 00:21:00,483
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though the program is for 10 days in the summer, it really takes all year to put it together.

206
00:21:00,503 --> 00:21:06,627
[SPEAKER_01]: The youth on the reservation apply for the program, which is happening right now.

207
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,868
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hopeful that it's gonna happen this year.

208
00:21:08,888 --> 00:21:16,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the fall, we're talking with host families and doing home visits and letting them know about the program.

209
00:21:16,713 --> 00:21:20,195
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really takes all year to sort of put this together.

210
00:21:20,215 --> 00:21:23,977
[SPEAKER_01]: And with COVID, everything sort of came to a standstill.

211
00:21:25,318 --> 00:21:34,484
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sort of pivoted in the beginning of COVID and thought, oh, what else can we do given the circumstances with the pandemic?

212
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:38,928
[SPEAKER_01]: And we came up with starting a pen pal program, which we did.

213
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:43,491
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started a pen pal program in the fall of 2020, I guess.

214
00:21:43,531 --> 00:21:44,132
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had over 100

215
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:56,270
[SPEAKER_01]: matches between youth on the reservation and youth in the greater Medford area where they could correspond by snail mail.

216
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,892
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that worked out really well.

217
00:21:59,973 --> 00:22:15,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've tried to think of other things that we can do during the pandemic to provide some assistance and connection with the youth and the families, because also we haven't been able to go there in two years either, which

218
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:22,872
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, has been very sad, but we've tried other ways to stay connected with the youth and the families up there.

219
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:40,065
[SPEAKER_01]: I think some of the other challenges, I mean, as you can imagine, there's a lot of logistics that go into a program like this, because we're flying the youth from South Dakota to Medford and- And by the way, there's no direct flight from Rapid City to Boston.

220
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:40,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

221
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:42,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're,

222
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:46,324
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 100% volunteer organization.

223
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:49,904
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're a program at the West Medford Community Center.

224
00:22:50,384 --> 00:22:56,945
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's just a lot of coordination that goes on between the families on the reservation and the host families.

225
00:22:57,746 --> 00:23:05,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything that we do is done pretty much in a group because that is what the youth is most comfortable with.

226
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:10,848
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do stay with host families, but every morning we get together

227
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:13,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have activities planned throughout the day.

228
00:23:13,945 --> 00:23:16,346
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do everything as a group.

229
00:23:18,126 --> 00:23:22,328
[SPEAKER_01]: The youth are totally fascinated by the ocean.

230
00:23:22,348 --> 00:23:26,189
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do a lot of things around the ocean.

231
00:23:26,229 --> 00:23:27,249
[SPEAKER_01]: We go to the beach.

232
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,990
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a rail watch.

233
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,811
[SPEAKER_01]: We go out to the harbor islands.

234
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:34,832
[SPEAKER_01]: And I swear, if we just went to the beach every day, they would

235
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:38,976
[SPEAKER_01]: perfectly happy because they just love the water.

236
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:52,403
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also do a lot in terms of, we do a photography workshop and then we give all the kids a camera and we encourage them to take pictures throughout the week while they're here.

237
00:23:52,583 --> 00:24:04,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end, we have a photography exhibit where we, like an art gallery, where we display, you know, one or two of their most favorite photographs for the community to come.

238
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:08,805
[SPEAKER_01]: We do an art workshop.

239
00:24:10,665 --> 00:24:12,987
[SPEAKER_01]: We do the college tours.

240
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:25,953
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the big events that we do is something we call teepee day, which we do down on the Mystic River in back of the West Medford Community Center in Duggar Park.

241
00:24:27,493 --> 00:24:28,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And the kids love that.

242
00:24:28,694 --> 00:24:32,596
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an 18 foot teepee and the kids put up the teepee.

243
00:24:33,236 --> 00:24:34,637
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the Wampanoag.

244
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:39,522
[SPEAKER_01]: drum group come up from Ashby with their dancers.

245
00:24:40,002 --> 00:24:44,283
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of the youth are powwow dancers.

246
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:49,824
[SPEAKER_01]: So they bring their regalia with them and they will dance during teepee day.

247
00:24:49,944 --> 00:25:00,707
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a wonderful community event and it gives the youth an opportunity to really share their culture, their dance with our community.

248
00:25:01,267 --> 00:25:01,467
[SPEAKER_01]: So

249
00:25:02,782 --> 00:25:06,625
[SPEAKER_01]: That was sort of the highlight, I guess, of the Youth Stay Week.

250
00:25:07,986 --> 00:25:10,028
[SPEAKER_00]: That and going to Fenway Park.

251
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:10,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.

252
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:15,552
[SPEAKER_01]: We take them to Fenway Park, which they also love.

253
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:18,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we try and create opportunities.

254
00:25:18,415 --> 00:25:25,300
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually talk to each group of youth every year and find out what they're interested in exploring.

255
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what do you want to do?

256
00:25:26,401 --> 00:25:30,544
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we sort of build the activities around their interests.

257
00:25:31,423 --> 00:25:32,524
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like a busy week.

258
00:25:33,884 --> 00:25:36,285
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very, it's an exhausting week.

259
00:25:36,365 --> 00:25:37,586
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't get a lot of sleep.

260
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:39,847
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I imagine.

261
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:47,491
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, I mean, my other question was about like the most rewarding parts and it sounds like there's a lot that comes out of it that is enjoyable as well.

262
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:50,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Bruce, would you add anything in terms of challenges or rewards?

263
00:25:53,194 --> 00:25:58,296
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think the biggest challenges are logistical, uh, both, you know,

264
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:08,263
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of what we do in preparation is go out to the reservation and get the kids together because they don't necessarily know each other in an area that vast.

265
00:26:08,703 --> 00:26:10,084
[SPEAKER_00]: You can imagine some of them do.

266
00:26:10,844 --> 00:26:16,528
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's a reservation, some of them are even distantly related.

267
00:26:16,588 --> 00:26:17,549
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll know each other.

268
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:22,613
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're so-and-so's nephew, right?

269
00:26:23,353 --> 00:26:27,356
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting them together on the reservation

270
00:26:28,263 --> 00:26:38,830
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, when it's not like we, we have a van that we go out there with or anything, we have to rely on volunteers to get kids together and find central locations where the kids can, can meet.

271
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:53,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we take them on field trips like to, uh, you know, they're really group, um, uh, group building exercises, taking them to a water park and in a rapid city, which is two hours away.

272
00:26:55,268 --> 00:27:06,036
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, go out for ice cream, different things that, so they get to know each other and feel comfortable getting on a plane and then getting them either through Chicago or Minneapolis here to Boston.

273
00:27:07,057 --> 00:27:15,383
[SPEAKER_00]: So that requires having volunteers on the reservation, adult volunteers that can accompany them, because we can't do all that.

274
00:27:15,744 --> 00:27:23,570
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, meeting them at the airport and picking them all up and distributing them to their various host families.

275
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:27,786
[SPEAKER_00]: And then transportation while they're here is also an issue.

276
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:30,388
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had people volunteer to do driving and so on.

277
00:27:30,408 --> 00:27:35,853
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of logistics to be worked out, as you might imagine, since every day is pretty busy.

278
00:27:37,254 --> 00:27:46,282
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a lot to sort of build group cohesion and comfort on the reservation a couple of weeks before they come.

279
00:27:46,322 --> 00:27:47,523
[SPEAKER_01]: We spend a week out there.

280
00:27:48,381 --> 00:27:52,403
[SPEAKER_01]: visiting all the youth and the families, getting them together, as Bruce said.

281
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:53,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Answering their questions.

282
00:27:53,583 --> 00:28:03,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Answering their questions so that by the time they get to the Rapid City Airport, they sort of know who their group is and they have a sense of trust and comfort within the group.

283
00:28:03,828 --> 00:28:16,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we usually have two adult, Lakota adult volunteers who travel with them and spend the week here with us, acting as co-leaders and facilitators for all the activities that we do.

284
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:21,078
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these kids, as you imagine, have never been on an airplane before.

285
00:28:21,858 --> 00:28:26,802
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a day trip in advance of coming here to the airport.

286
00:28:28,444 --> 00:28:36,050
[SPEAKER_00]: The manager of the airport has been very good about taking them around, showing them the big jets and the fire extinguishing equipment they have for the runway.

287
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,511
[SPEAKER_00]: And they get excited about that.

288
00:28:39,006 --> 00:28:54,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I didn't think about the sort of group cohesion element and how that, hopefully when they return after the trip, they've created some bonds with each other that I would hope would be another sort of source of support and hope and all that.

289
00:28:54,493 --> 00:28:54,553
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

290
00:28:55,393 --> 00:28:56,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do.

291
00:28:56,554 --> 00:29:02,558
[SPEAKER_01]: And a month or so after they return to the reservation, we do a get together out there.

292
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:09,362
[SPEAKER_01]: So we bring them all together and we seek their feedback, what went well, what didn't, what you think we should change.

293
00:29:10,002 --> 00:29:14,305
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they do develop friendships with one another.

294
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reservation is very remote.

295
00:29:18,207 --> 00:29:21,349
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so they may not see each other that often.

296
00:29:21,429 --> 00:29:27,874
[SPEAKER_01]: They may run into each other at basketball games or something like that, but they, they do stay connected in various ways.

297
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:30,075
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, that's really nice.

298
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:30,536
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

299
00:29:30,556 --> 00:29:37,740
[SPEAKER_00]: That may be a surprise to most people in this area, but basketball is like the craze on the reservation.

300
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,622
[SPEAKER_00]: They've always been great basketball players and fans.

301
00:29:40,642 --> 00:29:41,663
[SPEAKER_00]: They support their kids.

302
00:29:42,604 --> 00:29:47,267
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, the high school teams are kind of the big leagues of basketball on the reservation.

303
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:49,981
[SPEAKER_00]: both the girls and the boys.

304
00:29:50,902 --> 00:29:53,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

305
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:54,724
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you all funded?

306
00:29:54,804 --> 00:29:57,406
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you fund this work?

307
00:29:57,586 --> 00:29:58,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Good question.

308
00:29:59,287 --> 00:30:03,369
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do all our own fundraising.

309
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:09,513
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's totally run based on donations from individuals.

310
00:30:10,254 --> 00:30:15,077
[SPEAKER_01]: We have applied for some grants, which we've been fortunate and we've been able to

311
00:30:16,806 --> 00:30:21,390
[SPEAKER_01]: be awarded those, but we do a lot of fundraising throughout the year.

312
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:25,613
[SPEAKER_01]: We have different events that we do.

313
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:33,499
[SPEAKER_01]: We were planning on doing sort of a big event in April of 2020, which we ended up having to cancel.

314
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:40,204
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's totally funded by individual donations and grants.

315
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:44,748
[SPEAKER_00]: But even like grassroots opportunities like

316
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:51,383
[SPEAKER_00]: Bake sales, we've had bake sales cookie, the cookie walk we did for a couple of years, we've had silent auction.

317
00:30:51,423 --> 00:30:51,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

318
00:30:51,923 --> 00:30:52,344
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

319
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,626
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a challenge on top of, you know, just

320
00:30:59,638 --> 00:31:06,583
[SPEAKER_01]: running the program and every year setting up the host families, the youth applications.

321
00:31:06,683 --> 00:31:12,947
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the youth on the reservation may not have access to the internet.

322
00:31:13,128 --> 00:31:23,775
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I read a statistic that I think only 48% of households on the reservation have broadband compared to like 80% of the rest of the country.

323
00:31:25,598 --> 00:31:39,003
[SPEAKER_01]: So even the youth applications, a lot of times there's a lot of hands on that we need to do in terms of trying to figure out how to get the application completed, you know, how to get their references and that kind of thing.

324
00:31:39,083 --> 00:31:45,345
[SPEAKER_01]: So that can be, you know, quite time consuming trying to get through that process.

325
00:31:46,046 --> 00:31:52,068
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of logistics that we may not think about in terms of Medford, but

326
00:31:52,464 --> 00:31:55,747
[SPEAKER_01]: present sort of a challenge on the reservation.

327
00:31:55,767 --> 00:32:07,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like there's a, there's an opportunity for residents of Medford to sort of like become involved or come to the events that you all host when, when the kids are here.

328
00:32:07,137 --> 00:32:13,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any, like, are there any hopes that you have in terms of like an impact on Medford or the values of Medford?

329
00:32:13,203 --> 00:32:15,945
[SPEAKER_02]: How, you know, how this relates to the work that you all are doing?

330
00:32:19,143 --> 00:32:19,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

331
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:36,608
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as we talked about before, you know, one of our big goals was really to increase cultural awareness of Native history and of the land that we're on, even here in Medford, you know, we're on the ancestral

332
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:43,899
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional lands of the Massachusetts and Wampanoag people here in Medford.

333
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,161
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people aren't aware of that.

334
00:32:46,261 --> 00:32:56,011
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one of our goals is just to increase awareness and to have more understanding and respect for

335
00:32:56,893 --> 00:33:01,274
[SPEAKER_01]: the impact, the history, but also the current impact of Native people.

336
00:33:02,534 --> 00:33:10,576
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been very pleased over the last couple of years, I think since Standing Rock, that that seems to be coming more to the forefront.

337
00:33:10,676 --> 00:33:19,998
[SPEAKER_01]: And certainly with Secretary Holland's appointment in the Interior Department, I think there's more awareness that Native people are here.

338
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,719
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been here all along or on their land.

339
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:23,719
[SPEAKER_01]: And

340
00:33:24,962 --> 00:33:28,164
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there's more interest in learning more about that.

341
00:33:28,744 --> 00:33:43,292
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's true of them in Medford to a lot of the host families learned a lot from hosting a Lakota youth for the kids and the kids to and a lot of them have continued that friendship.

342
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:52,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of our families have actually gone out to the reservation to visit the kids that they hosted, which would not have happened, I'm sure, in the past.

343
00:33:53,180 --> 00:34:00,729
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of the youth that they hosted were invited back by the families to come for a visit.

344
00:34:01,363 --> 00:34:04,684
[SPEAKER_01]: So those sort of relationships have really taken root.

345
00:34:05,364 --> 00:34:09,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're really happy to see that because they're both learning a lot about each other.

346
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:29,348
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, and the country sort of bringing together diverse groups of people to increase sort of understanding sort of on that personal level, really can go a long way, I think, and, and healing, you know, some of the the history of this country.

347
00:34:29,508 --> 00:34:29,688
[SPEAKER_01]: So

348
00:34:31,051 --> 00:34:36,415
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been a very, very positive thing in terms of the Medford families.

349
00:34:37,135 --> 00:34:46,242
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also think the teepee day that we do, I mean, probably not many people in Medford have an opportunity to meet a Native person.

350
00:34:46,982 --> 00:34:53,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we don't have large reservations here like they do out West, even if you do, you may not know that.

351
00:34:54,031 --> 00:35:04,478
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this sort of gives families in Medford an opportunity to really get to know somebody from a different background than they have.

352
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:09,882
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think you did a good job.

353
00:35:11,103 --> 00:35:17,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it sounds like there's a lot of power in those individual relationships or even families relationships to these kids.

354
00:35:17,606 --> 00:35:20,027
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder what you hope people will do with that.

355
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:29,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So with what they're learning about Native people, are there any sort of macro hopes that you have for your program?

356
00:35:32,472 --> 00:35:33,973
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a response for that.

357
00:35:35,573 --> 00:35:38,155
[SPEAKER_00]: One year when we were down at the Wampanoag,

358
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:42,028
[SPEAKER_00]: The Mashpee, it's not really a reservation.

359
00:35:42,088 --> 00:35:44,349
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like what needed land.

360
00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:49,832
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, you know, it's a small area, but Wampanoag make good use of it.

361
00:35:50,632 --> 00:35:52,873
[SPEAKER_00]: We visited one of the older chiefs.

362
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:55,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, he was a retired chief.

363
00:35:55,614 --> 00:35:59,196
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was in his eighties or something like that, which is remarkable.

364
00:36:00,196 --> 00:36:02,938
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the kids were there.

365
00:36:03,058 --> 00:36:06,599
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the kids had his camera that day as they all did probably.

366
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,160
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took a picture.

367
00:36:09,389 --> 00:36:12,232
[SPEAKER_00]: in the backyard of this chief's home.

368
00:36:13,092 --> 00:36:15,634
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a wood carving that was hand painted.

369
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:17,916
[SPEAKER_00]: And it said, we are still here.

370
00:36:20,378 --> 00:36:23,200
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was a significant image for him.

371
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:27,564
[SPEAKER_00]: And he took that picture and it ended up in one of the photography exhibits we had one year.

372
00:36:29,265 --> 00:36:36,911
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for people in Medford to realize that Native Americans are still here, they didn't all die from,

373
00:36:38,313 --> 00:36:41,874
[SPEAKER_00]: chickenpox and armed conflict and that sort of thing.

374
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:57,259
[SPEAKER_00]: There are many, many people still surviving and they have, they're proud people and they have their own history and culture that they cherish and that's available to us and we should be aware of it.

375
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:07,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've been, you know, stewards of this land and the plants and the animals for generations and continue to do

376
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:08,869
[SPEAKER_01]: to do that.

377
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:11,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And we owe them a lot of respect for that.

378
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:16,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're learning now that we need to incorporate that more.

379
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:31,944
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to say that, you know, the city of Medford has been very supportive of the Lakota You Stay program in terms of lending resources and being, coming to a lot of our events.

380
00:37:32,705 --> 00:37:37,908
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even think in the last couple of years, you know, with the name change at the Missittuck School,

381
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:55,181
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think that was really exciting to us that there were so many people in support of changing the name of that school, and also acknowledging during a lot of the discussion about the name change, acknowledging the lands that

382
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:57,382
[SPEAKER_01]: inhabit now.

383
00:37:57,502 --> 00:38:04,805
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was, that was an exciting thing for us to see so many people in support of that in the city of Medford.

384
00:38:04,845 --> 00:38:12,708
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd like to think that we have some part in that by, you know, the Lakota You Stay program.

385
00:38:12,988 --> 00:38:15,029
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope that that continues.

386
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:21,411
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we'd like to see land acknowledgements at the city council meetings and the school committee meetings.

387
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:23,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'd like to see more

388
00:38:25,187 --> 00:38:33,450
[SPEAKER_01]: recognition of the land that we're on in terms of signage or events that happen in Medford.

389
00:38:33,551 --> 00:38:36,732
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's sort of our, I guess, our hope for the future.

390
00:38:36,752 --> 00:38:42,014
[SPEAKER_02]: So great hopes and in process, it seems like some of those things.

391
00:38:42,642 --> 00:38:43,983
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it does.

392
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:50,788
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there's a lot that, you know, Medford has such a strong art community.

393
00:38:50,988 --> 00:38:58,773
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's ways of bringing in Indigenous art in some way into our community in that way.

394
00:38:58,793 --> 00:39:07,319
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're hopeful that we're going to be able to have the Lakota Youth Day program this summer.

395
00:39:07,399 --> 00:39:09,000
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sort of going forward like

396
00:39:09,671 --> 00:39:10,131
[SPEAKER_00]: As if.

397
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:12,313
[SPEAKER_01]: As if we're going to be able to do that.

398
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:14,875
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see what happens with the pandemic.

399
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:20,459
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we're hoping to bring the kids here again in the summer.

400
00:39:20,619 --> 00:39:27,544
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're already talking with the Mashpee Wampanoag about doing the teepee day again next summer.

401
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:31,847
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a lot of hopes that things will progress.

402
00:39:32,988 --> 00:39:33,668
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope so, too.

403
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:35,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much.

404
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there anything else that you want to add before you wrap up?

405
00:39:42,107 --> 00:39:49,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we just are very grateful to the, you know, host families in Medford and beyond.

406
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:52,692
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had host families in Arlington and Malden and Winchester too.

407
00:39:53,372 --> 00:39:59,595
[SPEAKER_01]: And also just to the city for really supporting us like we're very appreciative of that.

408
00:40:00,375 --> 00:40:02,636
[SPEAKER_01]: And we hope it continues.

409
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:07,439
[SPEAKER_02]: How can folks find you if they want to know more information or get in touch?

410
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:08,439
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the best way to do that?

411
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:19,244
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have a website, lakotayoustay.org, and all our information is on there, including information about hosting and a host application.

412
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:23,166
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're on Facebook and Instagram too.

413
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:27,548
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we update that periodically as new things.

414
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I try and keep

415
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:44,194
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of information about Native issues on our Facebook page, so if you're curious about what might be going on in Native country that's a good place to look for information so.

416
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:45,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

417
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:49,087
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be sure to put that in the show notes so people can access that easily too.
