00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:17,176
is to provide a welcoming, accessible, and inclusive space to enjoy, engage, and have a diversity of the arts and cultural experiences. And this is only possible through the involvement of everybody in our community, so thank you. I wish there were more of you, but there isn't. That's fine.

2
00:00:17,176 --> 00:00:40,230
A big shout out and thank you to Jonathan for bringing this program here. And this is the other thing that was starred that I have to say. Tonight I'm very excited to let you know that one of our initiatives is to increase accessibility resources to all of the musicians in this area. So in two weeks we will be announcing the launch of our music program campaign.

3
00:00:41,032 --> 00:01:04,855
and to begin an effort to raise $15,000, which isn't all that much in the big scheme of things, to support the success of local musicians in this space. This will include a creation of a music rehearsal room for music lessons, jam sessions, and podcasting. This will also allow us to pay a local musician to create live music for our community, but it needs your support to make it happen.

4
00:01:06,203 --> 00:01:30,640
The other shout out was, if you notice on the on the all around the walls here is the most beautiful work. And it's like a fire sale. It's Will Tenney. And if you would like to purchase anything, it's an incredibly, incredibly well priced and all sales provide income for ACM and cachet. So we're a big shout out Fiona.

5
00:01:31,015 --> 00:01:44,189
Who's in the back will be doing all those financial transactions with ease and speed. So I just wanted to let you know about that. I think that's about everything else she wanted me to read.

6
00:01:45,196 --> 00:02:02,671
Oh, no, there's one more thing, and that is sign up for our newsletter. You can sign up for the cache newsletter over here and the back there with you, Fiona, the newsletter for ACM. Yes, and a lot more stuff. So go pick up the paperwork and enjoy tonight.

7
00:02:12,875 --> 00:02:30,759
I'm just going to use this in case there's anybody watching on the live stream. First of all, big shout out, thanks to Luke over there from Medford Community Media. He's waving. You can't see him because he's behind the camera. And also to my dad, Avi Fagan, who's been providing a lot of the sound support for this whole weekend of music.

8
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:52,807
Just a couple other individuals before, I know these guys have been waiting for a little bit, but there are actually a lot of people, more than ever this year, that have kind of come together to make this thing happen. First of all, to our student volunteers, Eitan Ko, over there, and to Fiona from Arts Collaborative Medford, yes.

9
00:02:52,807 --> 00:03:13,729
Arts Collaborative Medford. There are too many Medford arts organizations that all have very similar sounding names. So also to my partner, Shayla, who put together the awesome programs you have here. And to a couple other folks who aren't here tonight, but I'm going to mention them for the video anyway. To our former Poet Laureate at Medford, Terry Carter.

10
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:27,551
for he's going to be emceeing everything on Saturday and Sunday. He does an awesome job, and he's also part of the Ally Project, which is a band that I'm in. We'll be playing tomorrow at the West Medford Community Center from 1 to about 2.30.

11
00:03:28,114 --> 00:03:53,643
And also to our organizational sponsors. Oh, I'm sorry, just a couple other individuals who have donated for this year. Susan Klein, Steve Shulman, and also Ken Krause, who runs an amazing calendar as part of Cache. It's got all of the different arts things that are going on across the city. So if you're looking for things to do, there's never a good reason to be bored around here, especially now.

12
00:03:53,643 --> 00:04:09,582
To all of our Patreon members who have just continued to donate. Patreon is like a monthly subscription, but even a couple dollars goes a long way. We do jam sessions almost every month, and those are the people that allow us to make that happen.

13
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:37,722
Last, organizational sponsors. We've got the Medford Arts Council, the Arts Alive Medford Foundation, who have both provided us grants of the support this year, to Berkeley's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, Arts Collaborative Medford, which is this space, the West Medford Community Center, and then last, to Members Plus Credit Union, to Triangle Manor, the t-shirt company that we used this year, to Gnomon Copy and Print,

14
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:59,224
which helped us create these beautiful programs. And two, of course, Medford Community Media. So it really, it takes a whole community to run an event like this. And we've had a lot of support this year, which is exciting. So I'm going to turn it over to these guys. These musicians are all part of Morningside Music Studio, which is run by Dan Fox. Dan is taking a well-deserved vacation.

15
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:22,637
right now. But he is quite busy. Many great jazz ensembles with some really amazing creative voices. And so I'm going to turn it over to them. They can introduce themselves and tell you a little bit about what they're going to play, if you like. I looked at the set list they sent me last night, and it looks really interesting. So the Morningside Music Studio All-Stars.

16
00:05:28,285 --> 00:05:50,299
Thank you, Jonathan. It's an honor to be front-ending this fantastic festival. Third year now, or second? Well, more than that, but it's been virtual. It's been virtual, and rising up after the pandemic. So we're going to play, what, seven or eight tunes tonight, and I'll introduce the group a little later on.

So this next one is written by my dear friend Ein. And we haven't actually played it in a while. This is one of the first pieces that we played many, many years ago when we started the group. But we're going to kind of revisit it today for the first time in a while. I think this is Diane's first time performing this one.

152
01:46:32,483 --> 01:47:01,425
Anyway, the name of the tune is called The Wrath of the Seagull, and it's a little bit programmatic. So Ayn is a great traveler. She loves traveling the world. And this kind of came from a little visit to Venice. So I'm just going to read a little bit about what she said. So from Ayn's perspective, she says, we were walking into Venice along a small canal. It was a very beautiful morning, very sweet and pretty.

153
01:47:01,425 --> 01:47:30,862
We were walking over a bridge when I saw a pigeon fly into a wall. It tumbled down into the canal, and I went over to the edge to take a look at it. Then, out of nowhere, the seagull went over my head, swooping down on the pigeon. The seagull grabbed the pigeon's neck with its beak and started suffocating it. The pigeon was thrashing in the water, and the seagull had the beadiest, most evil eyes I've ever seen.

154
01:47:30,862 --> 01:47:57,756
Then the pigeon stopped, uh, thrashing and the seagull dragged it away into a hole in the side of a building and began to consume it. Okay, so that's, that's kinda... Okay, so you can imagine that story as you're listening to it and see if you can figure out where the seagull and the pigeon come into play.

155
01:48:00,794 --> 01:48:03,609

okay it's it sounded like you figured out who was the pigeon at least so okay next up um we're gonna do a piece uh by a wonderful musician named randy pingray who's also my husband so i might be a little bit biased but uh he writes great music for this group for all sorts of other groups i have a also a

166
01:53:17,978 --> 01:53:26,852

167
01:53:27,415 --> 01:53:57,329
in a few weeks. So anyway, this piece is called Parfrees Glen. He's from Wisconsin, and this is sort of a place that his parents would kind of bribe him to go by calling it the gummy bear forest. Anyway, but he kind of didn't like to go hiking as a kid, but he loves it now. And anyway, this piece for him kind of brings up nice memories of going for hikes with his family growing up.

And it's also in kind of an interesting time signature. And yeah, we just really love playing Danny's music. So I hope you enjoy it. This is called Hebdomad.
