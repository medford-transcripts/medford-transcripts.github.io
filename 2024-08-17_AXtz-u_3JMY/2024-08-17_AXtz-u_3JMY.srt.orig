1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:09,053
[SPEAKER_02]: is to provide a welcoming, accessible, and inclusive space to enjoy, engage, and have a diversity of the arts and cultural experiences.

2
00:00:09,953 --> 00:00:14,295
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is only possible through the involvement of everybody in our community, so thank you.

3
00:00:14,675 --> 00:00:16,276
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish there were more of you, but there isn't.

4
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:16,836
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

5
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:21,098
[SPEAKER_02]: A big shout out and thank you to Jonathan for bringing this program here.

6
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,240
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the other thing that was starred that I have to say.

7
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:33,466
[SPEAKER_02]: Tonight I'm very excited to let you know that one of our initiatives is to increase accessibility resources to all of the musicians in this area.

8
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:39,810
[SPEAKER_02]: So in two weeks we will be announcing the launch of our music program campaign.

9
00:00:41,132 --> 00:00:50,101
[SPEAKER_02]: and to begin an effort to raise $15,000, which isn't all that much in the big scheme of things, to support the success of local musicians in this space.

10
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:57,188
[SPEAKER_02]: This will include a creation of a music rehearsal room for music lessons, jam sessions, and podcasting.

11
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:04,655
[SPEAKER_02]: This will also allow us to pay a local musician to create live music for our community, but it needs your support to make it happen.

12
00:01:06,443 --> 00:01:13,308
[SPEAKER_02]: The other shout out was, if you notice on the on the all around the walls here is the most beautiful work.

13
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:15,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like a fire sale.

14
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:16,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Will Tenney.

15
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:27,638
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you would like to purchase anything, it's an incredibly, incredibly well priced and all sales provide income for ACM and cachet.

16
00:01:27,758 --> 00:01:30,400
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're a big shout out Fiona.

17
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:36,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's in the back will be doing all those financial transactions with ease and speed.

18
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:39,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to let you know about that.

19
00:01:39,764 --> 00:01:44,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's about everything else she wanted me to read.

20
00:01:45,356 --> 00:01:48,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, there's one more thing, and that is sign up for our newsletter.

21

[SPEAKER_02]: You can sign up for the cache newsletter over here and the back there with you, Fiona, the newsletter for ACM.

22
00:01:57,406 --> 00:01:59,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and a lot more stuff.

23
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:02,551
[SPEAKER_02]: So go pick up the paperwork and enjoy tonight.

24
00:02:12,935 --> 00:02:16,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to use this in case there's anybody watching on the live stream.

25
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,647
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, big shout out, thanks to Luke over there from Medford Community Media.

26
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:22,288
[SPEAKER_01]: He's waving.

27
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:24,671
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see him because he's behind the camera.

28
00:02:25,652 --> 00:02:30,539
[SPEAKER_01]: And also to my dad, Avi Fagan, who's been providing a lot of the sound support for this whole weekend of music.

29
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:41,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple other individuals before, I know these guys have been waiting for a little bit, but there are actually a lot of people, more than ever this year, that have kind of come together to make this thing happen.

30
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:52,587
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, to our student volunteers, Eitan Ko, over there, and to Fiona from Arts Collaborative Medford, yes.

31
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:53,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Arts Collaborative Medford.

32
00:02:54,309 --> 00:02:58,833
[SPEAKER_01]: There are too many Medford arts organizations that all have very similar sounding names.

33
00:02:59,314 --> 00:03:05,200
[SPEAKER_01]: So also to my partner, Shayla, who put together the awesome programs you have here.

34
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:10,285
[SPEAKER_01]: And to a couple other folks who aren't here tonight, but I'm going to mention them for the video anyway.

35
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:13,589
[SPEAKER_01]: To our former Poet Laureate at Medford, Terry Carter.

36
00:03:14,164 --> 00:03:17,226
[SPEAKER_01]: for he's going to be emceeing everything on Saturday and Sunday.

37
00:03:17,746 --> 00:03:22,268
[SPEAKER_01]: He does an awesome job, and he's also part of the Ally Project, which is a band that I'm in.

38
00:03:22,448 --> 00:03:26,831
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be playing tomorrow at the West Medford Community Center from 1 to about 2.30.

39
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:31,255
[SPEAKER_01]: And also to our organizational sponsors.

40
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:36,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I'm sorry, just a couple other individuals who have donated for this year.

41
00:03:36,397 --> 00:03:42,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Susan Klein, Steve Shulman, and also Ken Krause, who runs an amazing calendar as part of Cache.

42
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,661
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got all of the different arts things that are going on across the city.

43
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:53,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're looking for things to do, there's never a good reason to be bored around here, especially now.

44
00:03:54,604 --> 00:03:57,768
[SPEAKER_01]: To all of our Patreon members who have just continued to donate.

45
00:03:57,808 --> 00:04:03,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Patreon is like a monthly subscription, but even a couple dollars goes a long way.

46
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:09,202
[SPEAKER_01]: We do jam sessions almost every month, and those are the people that allow us to make that happen.

47
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:12,864
[SPEAKER_01]: Last, organizational sponsors.

48
00:04:12,924 --> 00:04:37,102
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the Medford Arts Council, the Arts Alive Medford Foundation, who have both provided us grants of the support this year, to Berkeley's Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, Arts Collaborative Medford, which is this space, the West Medford Community Center, and then last, to Members Plus Credit Union, to Triangle Manor, the t-shirt company that we used this year, to Gnomon Copy and Print,

49
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:39,764
[SPEAKER_01]: which helped us create these beautiful programs.

50
00:04:40,585 --> 00:04:42,887
[SPEAKER_01]: And two, of course, Medford Community Media.

51
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:46,411
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really, it takes a whole community to run an event like this.

52
00:04:46,731 --> 00:04:49,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had a lot of support this year, which is exciting.

53
00:04:50,275 --> 00:04:52,017
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to turn it over to these guys.

54
00:04:52,337 --> 00:04:57,022
[SPEAKER_01]: These musicians are all part of Morningside Music Studio, which is run by Dan Fox.

55
00:04:57,142 --> 00:04:58,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Dan is taking a well-deserved vacation.

56
00:04:59,484 --> 00:04:59,844
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.

57
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:02,006
[SPEAKER_01]: But he is quite busy.

58
00:05:03,146 --> 00:05:08,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Many great jazz ensembles with some really amazing creative voices.

59
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:10,450
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to turn it over to them.

60
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:16,113
[SPEAKER_01]: They can introduce themselves and tell you a little bit about what they're going to play, if you like.

61
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:19,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I looked at the set list they sent me last night, and it looks really interesting.

62
00:05:19,815 --> 00:05:22,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So the Morningside Music Studio All-Stars.

63
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:29,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Jonathan.

64
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:33,989
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an honor to be front-ending this fantastic festival.

65
00:05:34,349 --> 00:05:35,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Third year now, or second?

66
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, more than that, but it's been virtual.

67
00:05:40,213 --> 00:05:43,595
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been virtual, and rising up after the pandemic.

68
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:49,819
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to play, what, seven or eight tunes tonight, and I'll introduce the group a little later on.

69
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:54,344
do do

70
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,848

[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

74
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:38,947
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a tune called Biru Kirisai by the great and unfortunately late Jim Rotondi, a great jazz trumpet player who passed on July 8.

75
00:12:40,288 --> 00:12:41,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, unexpectedly.

76
00:12:42,991 --> 00:12:47,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to take us back in time a little bit with a standard.

77
00:16:20,264 --> 00:16:20,404
do

78
00:16:49,755 --> 00:16:50,338

[SPEAKER_07]: You're my everything, everything, everything.

81
00:18:59,274 --> 00:19:00,455
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, we're starting to fill out.

82
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:04,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost standing room.

83
00:19:07,137 --> 00:19:12,798
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Santiago Hernandez on the drums, hailing from Weymouth.

84
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:20,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Travisano on the bass from Carlisle, with a significant representation in the audience.

[SPEAKER_07]: Mike Zack from Belmont.

89
00:19:32,511 --> 00:19:33,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Watertown?

90
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,134
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was Belmont on tenor.

91
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:38,996
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm Peter Oren on trumpet from Belmont.

92
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:42,119
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

93
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go back in time.

94
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,082
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't do a set these days without a Wayne Shorter tune.

95
00:19:48,223 --> 00:19:50,505
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is called Backstage Sally.

96

do

103
00:33:06,423 --> 00:33:11,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I suddenly didn't need the light on my stand for some reason.

104
00:33:23,072 --> 00:33:25,314
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought we were in a dark and intimate jazz club.

105
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:36,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody know who wrote some other time?

106
00:33:40,264 --> 00:33:41,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Leonard Bernstein.

107
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,811
[SPEAKER_07]: I could do it all.

108
00:34:08,209 --> 00:34:10,050
[SPEAKER_07]: Until we get the hook, we're going to keep playing.

109
00:34:10,771 --> 00:34:12,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I know he's got a big hook somewhere.

110
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:18,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Another great tune by Jim Rotondi, great trumpeter, called Pete's 32.

111
00:34:18,535 --> 00:34:30,402
[SPEAKER_07]: One, two, one, two.

112

[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

00:40:46,461 --> 00:40:46,841
[SPEAKER_07]: Pete's 32.

00:40:46,881 --> 00:40:47,181
[SPEAKER_07]: 32 bars.

119
00:40:47,241 --> 00:40:51,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds like what I did last night.

120
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:53,922
[SPEAKER_06]: 32 bars in one night.

121
00:40:58,939 --> 00:41:00,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Good thing his son isn't here.

122
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:02,922
[SPEAKER_06]: It is mid-August.

123
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:45,660

127
00:46:14,694 --> 00:46:15,554
That's it.

128
00:46:46,397 --> 00:46:47,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Best thing for you.

129
00:46:47,777 --> 00:46:50,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it the best thing for you or the best thing for you is me?

130
00:46:50,418 --> 00:46:51,838
[SPEAKER_06]: Best thing for you is me.

131
00:46:52,038 --> 00:46:52,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

132
00:46:52,798 --> 00:46:55,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, depends on the context, I guess.

133
00:46:56,139 --> 00:46:56,739
[SPEAKER_07]: Irving Berlin.

134
00:46:56,759 --> 00:47:05,681
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, we're going to wrap it up with a little New York attitude here on a steamy evening in Medford.

135
00:47:06,121 --> 00:47:10,622
[SPEAKER_07]: New York attitude by Kenny Barron.

136
00:47:10,782 --> 00:47:11,262

00:52:20,657 --> 00:52:20,717
So,

00:54:23,766 --> 00:54:24,106

[SPEAKER_07]: We are the Morningside All Stars.

147
00:54:27,792 --> 00:54:30,776
[SPEAKER_07]: We made the big journey over from our Arlington hub.

148
00:54:31,356 --> 00:54:36,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much to Jonathan and his team and the festival for having us here tonight.

149
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:45,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's a wonderful mix of tunes, you guys.

150
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:45,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

151
00:54:46,872 --> 00:54:48,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the Morningside All Stars.

152
00:54:49,554 --> 00:54:51,035
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it a little questioningly.

153
00:54:52,816 --> 00:54:53,616
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't put it that way.

154
00:54:53,656 --> 00:54:54,417
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys sound great.

155
00:54:55,538 --> 00:55:00,921
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have some time before the Achilles Heel Sax Quartet is going to close things out.

156
00:55:01,742 --> 00:55:11,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't we take another 5, 10 minutes now just to refresh, grab a beverage or a snack or something if you want, and then we'll do a little bit of jamming.

157
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:19,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, for right now, I just see a bunch of other piano players in the audience, which is not exactly a shock, knowing that it's me who's organizing this.

158
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:26,942
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, we'll have some time to just have a few people sit in, and then we'll be back for the Achilles Heel Sax Quartet.

159
00:55:38,232 --> 00:55:38,793
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

160
00:55:40,461 --> 00:55:44,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I think we're going to start with Gail here, sitting in with the rest of the band.

161
00:55:44,392 --> 00:55:48,043
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, Joe, do you want to play melodica?

162
00:56:14,142 --> 00:56:16,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the chorus and the harmony.

163
00:56:16,423 --> 00:56:23,525
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently, ever since like the 40s or 50s, it was like a really popular educational tool in Japan.

164
00:56:23,545 --> 00:56:25,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Like every single child got one.

165
00:56:25,605 --> 00:56:26,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's great.

166
00:56:26,526 --> 00:56:28,326
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it teaches you keyboard skills.

167
00:56:28,346 --> 00:56:28,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's fantastic.

168
00:56:29,027 --> 00:56:29,607
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure.

169
00:56:29,627 --> 00:56:30,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we have this great song.

170
00:56:30,567 --> 00:56:31,527
[SPEAKER_06]: We have song flute.

171
00:56:31,547 --> 00:56:32,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I had a recorder.

172
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:35,168
[SPEAKER_06]: A recorder was like a dumbed-down recorder.

173
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,529
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like a ten-whistler.

174
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:39,230
[SPEAKER_06]: So she's making sure when she does it, I'm like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

175
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,611
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's a B-flat.

176
00:56:56,651 --> 00:56:57,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's a B-flat.

177
00:56:57,692 --> 00:56:58,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-oh, okay.

178
00:56:58,473 --> 00:56:59,234
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a bass.

179
00:57:44,372 --> 00:57:44,733
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so great.

180
00:58:39,855 --> 00:58:39,955
do

181
00:59:13,388 --> 00:59:13,689
[SPEAKER_03]: do

182
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:32,150
do

183
01:02:54,943 --> 01:02:55,003
do

184
01:07:19,222 --> 01:07:21,103
So this is a newer one.

185
01:07:21,123 --> 01:07:23,283
But yeah, they can get out of tune.

186
01:07:23,363 --> 01:07:27,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think when they get out of tune, they get in there and file the reads and stuff.

187
01:07:43,075 --> 01:07:49,197
[SPEAKER_05]: The key has a reed, and when you press the key, it opens a hole so that the air can vibrate the reed.

188
01:07:49,217 --> 01:07:50,917
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right, because you're blowing into it.

189
01:07:50,957 --> 01:07:51,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.

190
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:53,498
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there will never be another you?

191
01:07:53,598 --> 01:07:54,178
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

192
01:07:54,258 --> 01:07:54,298
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

193
01:07:54,758 --> 01:07:57,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just practicing that this week.

194
01:07:57,579 --> 01:07:57,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh.

195
01:07:57,759 --> 01:08:00,040
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to give this to you?

196
01:08:00,060 --> 01:08:00,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

197
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:00,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Here.

198
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:07,021
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to do like three tunes that I know by heart in my life, and you've got to be one of them.

199
01:09:12,049 --> 01:09:12,649
Thank you.

200
01:09:42,419 --> 01:09:42,641
you

201
01:14:50,613 --> 01:14:52,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there another pianist?

202
01:14:53,015 --> 01:14:53,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

203
01:14:58,320 --> 01:14:58,760
[SPEAKER_03]: John, you play.

204
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:56,704
you

205
01:22:30,376 --> 01:22:34,460
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright so thank you again to the Morningside All Stars for serving as our house band.

206
01:22:35,001 --> 01:22:45,331
[SPEAKER_01]: And to everybody who sat in, it's always a great time, it's part of our tradition, well I guess a tradition we started with the Medford Jazz Festival of hosting jam sessions every

207
01:22:46,672 --> 01:22:54,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, not every month, but every month that we can, usually at the West Medford Community Center, so I'm very excited that we've gotten to get a taste of that here.

208
01:22:54,997 --> 01:23:04,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take 10 or 15 minutes, just reset for the Achilles Heel Sax Quartet, and then I'll be back to introduce them in, well, in 10, 15 minutes.

209
01:24:13,422 --> 01:24:20,986
[SPEAKER_01]: So now, I'm really glad to introduce Kathy Olson and this group, the Achilles Heel, H-E-A-L, right?

210
01:24:21,187 --> 01:24:21,487
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

211
01:24:22,147 --> 01:24:26,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Quartet, see, so there's a little bit of wordplay that I have to acknowledge right off the bat.

212
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:39,157
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like they're going to do a bunch of interesting saxophone quartet arrangements, and they are featuring Diane Wernick, Rick Stone, and Sean Berry, and along with Kathy Olson.

213
01:24:39,638 --> 01:24:44,718
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, a warm Medford welcome to them, and I'll let them tell you what they're going to play.

214
01:25:43,361 --> 01:25:45,123
you you

215
01:27:20,519 --> 01:27:20,679
do

216
01:30:19,856 --> 01:30:20,536
do do

217
01:30:45,043 --> 01:30:45,303
do

218
01:32:10,518 --> 01:32:10,618
do

219
01:32:45,290 --> 01:32:48,412
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that first piece was standard, actually.

220
01:32:48,432 --> 01:32:51,954
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the only one we're doing tonight, but it was called Did I Do.

221
01:32:52,854 --> 01:32:54,215
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of my arrangements.

222
01:32:55,316 --> 01:33:02,820
[SPEAKER_00]: This group actually plays music by both folks in the group and also by some of our favorite friends and composers.

223
01:33:03,821 --> 01:33:09,450
[SPEAKER_00]: So this next tune is written by a friend of mine, Dylan Foley, who I used to play in a band with for quite a long time.

224
01:33:09,991 --> 01:33:11,694
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just really love his writing.

225
01:33:11,754 --> 01:33:14,057
[SPEAKER_00]: So he wrote this one for us.

226
01:33:14,117 --> 01:33:16,782
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Rally the Synesthetes.

227
01:33:35,168 --> 01:33:35,668
[SPEAKER_03]: do do

228
01:33:57,341 --> 01:33:57,441
do

229
01:34:59,659 --> 01:35:00,040
do do

230
01:35:46,129 --> 01:35:46,209
you

231
01:36:15,545 --> 01:36:15,705
Bye!

232
01:36:53,517 --> 01:36:53,798
[SPEAKER_03]: do do

233
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:26,454
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, next up we have a tune by a friend of mine named Tom Hoyt-Natsky.

234
01:37:26,474 --> 01:37:28,716
[SPEAKER_00]: He actually wrote us a whole suite of pieces.

235
01:37:28,736 --> 01:37:34,140
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just gonna play sort of one from the suite, and this is called Chick Cotta.

236
01:37:34,641 --> 01:37:37,383
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spelled like Chick Corea.

237
01:37:37,543 --> 01:37:38,164
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we go.

238
01:37:41,767 --> 01:37:46,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and let's applaud Diane for switching back and forth between soprano and alto.

239
01:38:05,410 --> 01:38:05,991
do do

240
01:41:23,769 --> 01:41:25,830
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, next up we have another one of my tunes.

241
01:41:25,990 --> 01:41:29,571
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually called Achilles Heel, which I guess is where we got our name.

242
01:41:31,252 --> 01:41:32,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you enjoy it.

243
01:41:32,412 --> 01:41:36,454
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got kind of an interesting groove.

244
01:41:36,754 --> 01:41:41,256
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little like lopsided, like if you had ruptured your Achilles.

245
01:41:42,796 --> 01:41:48,039
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's gonna feature, or that last one featured Rick and Diane.

246
01:41:48,059 --> 01:41:51,460
[SPEAKER_00]: And this one's gonna feature me and Rick.

247
01:42:17,395 --> 01:42:17,895
do do

248
01:42:59,385 --> 01:42:59,705
do do

249
01:46:12,051 --> 01:46:16,094
[SPEAKER_00]: So this next one is written by my dear friend Ein.

250
01:46:17,134 --> 01:46:18,816
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't actually played it in a while.

251
01:46:18,836 --> 01:46:24,379
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the first pieces that we played many, many years ago when we started the group.

252
01:46:25,220 --> 01:46:29,082
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to kind of revisit it today for the first time in a while.

253
01:46:29,142 --> 01:46:31,484
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is Diane's first time performing this one.

254
01:46:33,103 --> 01:46:37,947
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, the name of the tune is called The Wrath of the Seagull, and it's a little bit programmatic.

255
01:46:38,688 --> 01:46:41,230
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ayn is a great traveler.

256
01:46:41,610 --> 01:46:43,651
[SPEAKER_00]: She loves traveling the world.

257
01:46:44,252 --> 01:46:47,374
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of came from a little visit to Venice.

258
01:46:47,594 --> 01:46:50,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going to read a little bit about what she said.

259
01:46:50,757 --> 01:46:56,942
[SPEAKER_00]: So from Ayn's perspective, she says, we were walking into Venice along a small canal.

260
01:46:57,422 --> 01:47:00,464
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very beautiful morning, very sweet and pretty.

261
01:47:01,625 --> 01:47:05,988
[SPEAKER_00]: We were walking over a bridge when I saw a pigeon fly into a wall.

262
01:47:06,688 --> 01:47:10,710
[SPEAKER_00]: It tumbled down into the canal, and I went over to the edge to take a look at it.

263
01:47:11,291 --> 01:47:16,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, out of nowhere, the seagull went over my head, swooping down on the pigeon.

264
01:47:17,254 --> 01:47:21,497
[SPEAKER_00]: The seagull grabbed the pigeon's neck with its beak and started suffocating it.

265
01:47:22,057 --> 01:47:29,861
[SPEAKER_00]: The pigeon was thrashing in the water, and the seagull had the beadiest, most evil eyes I've ever seen.

266
01:47:31,282 --> 01:47:39,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the pigeon stopped, uh, thrashing and the seagull dragged it away into a hole in the side of a building and began to consume it.

267
01:47:39,507 --> 01:47:57,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that's, that's kinda... Okay, so you can imagine that story as you're listening to it and see if you can figure out where the seagull and the pigeon come into play.

268
01:48:01,618 --> 01:48:01,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Gone.

269
01:48:02,644 --> 01:48:02,986
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever.

270
01:52:47,090 --> 01:52:47,554
Thank you.

271
01:52:54,719 --> 01:53:17,297
[SPEAKER_00]: okay it's it sounded like you figured out who was the pigeon at least so okay next up um we're gonna do a piece uh by a wonderful musician named randy pingray who's also my husband so i might be a little bit biased but uh he writes great music for this group for all sorts of other groups i have a also a

272
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:23,346
[SPEAKER_00]: a group where he plays trombone and I play bari sax and we have bass and drums and he writes for that.

273
01:53:23,407 --> 01:53:26,672
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has a big band actually, he's got a concert coming up in the...

274
01:53:27,475 --> 01:53:28,115
[SPEAKER_00]: in a few weeks.

275
01:53:28,215 --> 01:53:31,817
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, this piece is called Parfrees Glen.

276
01:53:32,858 --> 01:53:42,462
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from Wisconsin, and this is sort of a place that his parents would kind of bribe him to go by calling it the gummy bear forest.

277
01:53:44,523 --> 01:53:48,565
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, but he kind of didn't like to go hiking as a kid, but he loves it now.

278
01:53:48,805 --> 01:53:56,269
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyway, this piece for him kind of brings up nice memories of going for hikes with his family growing up.

279
01:53:56,569 --> 01:53:57,049
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, here we go.

280
01:54:21,631 --> 01:54:22,812
One, two, three.

281
01:55:16,682 --> 01:55:16,802
you.

282
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:44,483
you.

283
01:57:38,797 --> 01:57:43,501
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this next piece is by another friend of mine, Danny Fratina.

284
01:57:44,141 --> 01:57:46,043
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also an excellent composer.

285
01:57:46,063 --> 01:57:54,589
[SPEAKER_00]: He has kind of been living in another city at this point, but he wrote this piece for us.

286
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:58,452
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also in kind of an interesting time signature.

287
01:58:00,013 --> 01:58:02,055
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we just really love playing Danny's music.

288
01:58:02,135 --> 01:58:03,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope you enjoy it.

289
01:58:03,396 --> 01:58:04,917
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called Hebdomad.

290
01:58:50,543 --> 01:58:50,843

291
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:08,490

do

294

[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, next up we have another one of my tunes.

295
02:03:55,948 --> 02:03:57,268
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called Reverie.

296
02:03:58,148 --> 02:04:01,589
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of makes you feel a little bit like you're in a dream.

297
02:04:01,609 --> 02:04:09,070
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to kind of feature us soloing sort of together, which is kind of a nice thing for this group.

298
02:04:09,110 --> 02:04:11,811
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone is so sensitive and listens to each other.

299
02:04:12,791 --> 02:04:14,512
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope you enjoy it.

300
02:04:14,552 --> 02:04:16,032
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called, again, Reverie.

301
02:04:34,585 --> 02:04:35,685
[SPEAKER_03]: do do

302
02:05:26,508 --> 02:05:26,708

02:09:23,706 --> 02:09:27,148
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, next up we have another tune by Randy Pingray.

306
02:09:28,208 --> 02:09:33,230
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it's sort of a reimagination of the tune I Love You by Cole Porter.

307
02:09:35,171 --> 02:09:37,853
[SPEAKER_00]: So, let's see if you can hear the tune at all.

308
02:09:39,553 --> 02:09:46,657
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to say again how much fun it is playing with this group, such great saxophone players.

309
02:09:47,817 --> 02:09:51,259
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have Rick Stone on alto saxophone.

310
02:09:54,189 --> 02:09:55,370
[SPEAKER_00]: He also wrote some of the tunes.

311
02:09:55,470 --> 02:10:00,033
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we haven't done one of Rick's yet, but we're gonna do a few of Rick's tunes later today as well.

312
02:10:00,734 --> 02:10:06,138
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Sean Berry on tenor saxophone.

313
02:10:06,298 --> 02:10:10,581
[SPEAKER_00]: And Diane Wernick doing double duty on soprano and alto saxophone.

314
02:10:12,582 --> 02:10:13,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Kathy Elton.

315
02:11:25,043 --> 02:11:25,123
you

316
02:12:21,474 --> 02:12:22,175
do do

317
02:13:15,722 --> 02:13:16,543
do do

318
02:15:49,019 --> 02:16:04,124
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, I know these guys have a couple more tunes for you, but in the meantime, just wanted to give you a preview of what's coming up tomorrow at the West Medford Community Center, the Ally Project, and Berkeley's Institute of Jazz for Gender Justice.

319
02:16:04,604 --> 02:16:12,567
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be great shows featuring poet Terry Carter and great piano player Anastasia Petrova.

320
02:16:12,967 --> 02:16:15,528
[SPEAKER_01]: So please come out if you're, oh, someone knows her.

321
02:16:15,988 --> 02:16:16,448
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

322
02:16:16,508 --> 02:16:17,249
[SPEAKER_01]: We all know her.

323
02:16:17,369 --> 02:16:17,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

324
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:18,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

325
02:16:18,430 --> 02:16:21,412
[SPEAKER_01]: And see, Berkeley seems to be the unifying force.

326
02:16:23,313 --> 02:16:31,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Second, please, I know this is a free event to the public, but if you like what you hear, please consider dropping a few dollars into our donation bin.

327
02:16:32,220 --> 02:16:36,503
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also conveniently a Venmo link in your program this year.

328
02:16:37,283 --> 02:16:39,245
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you prefer to donate that way.

329
02:16:40,406 --> 02:16:44,368
[SPEAKER_01]: really it does take an entire community of support in order to sustain what we're doing here.

330
02:16:45,389 --> 02:16:48,851
[SPEAKER_01]: But with that said, thanks again to Achilles Heel.

331
02:16:49,031 --> 02:16:50,552
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are great, right?

332
02:16:51,173 --> 02:16:51,713
[SPEAKER_01]: We like them?

333
02:16:52,174 --> 02:16:52,394
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

334
02:16:55,236 --> 02:16:58,198
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you also to Arts Collaborative Medford for hosting us tonight.

335
02:16:58,278 --> 02:16:59,899
[SPEAKER_01]: It is really special to be in this space.

336
02:17:03,291 --> 02:17:06,820
[SPEAKER_01]: hoping many more jazz concerts to come here.

337
02:17:07,081 --> 02:17:10,349
[SPEAKER_01]: So with that said, I'll turn it over to them, play a couple more tunes for you.

338
02:17:13,447 --> 02:17:18,048
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so as before mentioned, we're going to play one of Rick Stone's tunes.

339
02:17:18,148 --> 02:17:19,509
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called Reunion.

340
02:17:19,529 --> 02:17:30,892
[SPEAKER_00]: And this group, actually, since Sean kind of lives in New York, and we have, you know, gigs kind of sporadically throughout the year, and all of us play in lots of other groups.

341
02:17:31,432 --> 02:17:39,135
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is a group where we all get to play together, and it always kind of feels like a little reunion whenever we do have a concert.

342
02:17:39,695 --> 02:17:40,435
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we go, Reunion.

343
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:23,910
do do

344
02:22:02,731 --> 02:22:03,271
do do

345
02:22:50,768 --> 02:22:56,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and in the audience, actually, we have one of our friends and composers who wrote this next piece that we're gonna play.

346
02:22:58,071 --> 02:22:59,032
[SPEAKER_00]: Jim Ripa is here.

347
02:23:03,994 --> 02:23:12,717
[SPEAKER_00]: He's also a saxophone player, and he does a great job writing for Saxophone Quartet, and it's our pleasure to play this piece called Stone's Love Away.

348
02:23:14,098 --> 02:23:18,520
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a contra fact on sweet and lovely, and we hope that you enjoy it.

349
02:24:09,932 --> 02:24:10,452
do do

350
02:24:30,836 --> 02:24:30,956
do

351
02:25:14,810 --> 02:25:16,311
[SPEAKER_03]: do do

352
02:26:11,245 --> 02:26:11,705
do do

353
02:27:21,411 --> 02:27:21,971
do do

354
02:27:51,647 --> 02:27:52,207
Thanks, Jim.

355
02:27:52,227 --> 02:27:57,769
So should we just do one more?

356
02:27:57,889 --> 02:27:59,770
Is that what you're thinking?

357
02:28:31,826 --> 02:28:34,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we have two more, I guess, for you.

358
02:28:34,528 --> 02:28:36,810
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is another one of Rick Stone's.

359
02:28:37,891 --> 02:28:39,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you have anything you wanted to say about that?

360
02:28:44,637 --> 02:28:45,377
[SPEAKER_00]: He's consistent.

361
02:28:45,517 --> 02:28:51,943
[SPEAKER_00]: I always ask him at least once during the concert if he wants to say anything, but this is a really fun tune.

362
02:28:51,963 --> 02:28:56,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I always kind of think of like Mortal Kombat or something when we're playing this.

363
02:28:59,562 --> 02:29:00,948
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, I hope you enjoy it.

364
02:29:00,968 --> 02:29:03,820
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called Repetition, and again, it's by Rick Stone.

365
02:32:00,148 --> 02:32:00,268
Whoo!

366
02:32:35,480 --> 02:32:37,802
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we have one more piece for you.

367
02:32:37,842 --> 02:32:39,464
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another one of Rick's tunes.

368
02:32:40,284 --> 02:32:45,128
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called, Everything's Fine, or you could also interpret it, Everything's Fine.

369
02:32:45,289 --> 02:32:47,971
[SPEAKER_00]: So, however you're feeling at the moment.

370
02:32:47,991 --> 02:32:52,014
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some things coming up that might determine that feeling.

371
02:32:53,435 --> 02:32:54,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully everything's fine, right?

372
02:32:54,897 --> 02:32:57,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's fine, okay.

373
02:32:57,979 --> 02:33:01,182
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I'd just like to introduce Rick Stone on alto saxophone.

374
02:33:05,310 --> 02:33:11,680
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way from New York City, Sean Berry on tenor sax.

375
02:33:11,861 --> 02:33:15,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Diane Wernick on soprano and alto saxophones.

376
02:33:16,989 --> 02:33:19,412
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm Kathy Olson playing bari sax.

377
02:34:09,864 --> 02:34:09,945
you

378
02:36:10,894 --> 02:36:11,054
do

379
02:37:25,162 --> 02:37:27,576
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, the Achilles heel saxophone quartet.

380
02:37:31,687 --> 02:37:39,033
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll assure you that no real pigeons were harmed, by the way, in the creation of this particular program.

381
02:37:39,073 --> 02:37:40,695
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, thank you all seriously.

382
02:37:40,775 --> 02:37:43,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Such a delight to have you open the weekend for us.

383
02:37:43,717 --> 02:37:48,381
[SPEAKER_01]: And please come back on Saturday or Sunday, or even both, if you can.

384
02:37:48,781 --> 02:37:53,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks again to our sponsors, to everybody who helped out behind the scenes tonight, to Arts Collaborative Medford.

385
02:37:54,846 --> 02:37:56,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great night, and I hope to see you again soon.

386
02:38:04,812 --> 02:38:05,936
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actual quartets.
