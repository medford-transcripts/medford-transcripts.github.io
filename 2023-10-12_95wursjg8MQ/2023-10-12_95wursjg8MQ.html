    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=355.137s">I</a>  think go ahead and introduce, have everybody introduce themselves, and then I think we would love to hear from you all.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=364.119s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=366.86s">So</a>  Carolyn, why don't you start? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=370.666s">Hi,</a>  I'm Karen.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=371.466s">I'm</a>  the team manager of the website team. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=375.847s">I</a>  just have to thank you for being here and work together with you all.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=404.468s">We</a>  are thrilled to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=405.648s">We</a>  love having students in our subcommittee meetings and at our regular meetings, but these are a little bit easier for people to get to, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=413.792s">If</a>  they have to go to bed and go to school the next day, so. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=418.393s">So</a>  Superintendent, I don't know if you wanted to say anything before we turn it over to Miss Miller to do a presentation.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=425.596s">Yes,</a>  I just want to say thank you Miss Miller for your leadership and for holding down the entire web. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=433.839s">All</a>  the work that's the back end on the website that we have and working with the students who are doing fabulous work I also wanted to share that I believe some of our students have had the opportunity to work with City Hall as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=450.264s">In</a>  the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=452.144s">So</a>  I hope that that work is able to continue happening, doing continued web work. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=458.449s">So</a>  I just want to congratulate them and encourage you to keep doing the wonderful work that all of you are doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=464.854s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=466.516s">I</a>  look forward to seeing your brief presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=471.059s">I</a>  also just want to recognize, too, as part of the team, Thomas, who's working closely with all of us on the senior executive team side, helping us with furthering our communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=483.982s">So</a>  I'm very happy for the collaboration and partnership in how we are working to communicate as clearly and as effectively to the entire Medford community. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=495.944s">So</a>  thank you to both of you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=498.705s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=502.216s">And</a>  I do believe Dr. Cushing made you a co-host, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=506.72s">Miller,</a>  so you should be able to share your slide deck to just point out some of the key highlights of the work that you're doing.</p>

    <p>[X1f0jMHGEbc_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=514.167s">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=515.448s">Should</a>  I go ahead and start?</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=517.209s">Yeah,</a>  please do. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=517.79s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=517.89s">Let</a>  me.</p>

    <p>[X1f0jMHGEbc_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=527.521s">I</a>  have to say it's been a while since I've had to share on Zoom back from the COVID early days. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=533.983s">Can</a>  you see the slide presentation? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=536.883s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=537.303s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[X1f0jMHGEbc_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=537.643s">OK,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=539.744s">Please</a>  don't hesitate to ask questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=542.245s">I</a>  am going to go through this fairly quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=545.105s">You</a>  can ask questions along the way, comment, or wait till I'm done, whatever works best. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=550.347s">And</a>  the students are available for questions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=553.787s">So</a>  with that, let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=557.495s">See</a>  if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=562.019s">OK,</a>  so there is the website team. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=563.781s">There's</a>  two additional team members that did not have a chance to introduce themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=569.487s">Sekou</a>  Koyade and Vasilijas Tufis. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=573.451s">They</a>  are both part of the team and part of the picture that you can see right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=579.356s">And</a>  it's a really great student team. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=583.573s">Um,</a>  I also wanted to just acknowledge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=588.163s">So</a>  the students are the ones that are do and and I do a lot of the page update so if the. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=594.989s">Lunch</a>  menu needs to be updated or information on any of the pages need to be updated the students do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=602.416s">And</a>  then they also do some of the posting in the various news areas, but the additional posting is done by Thomas Dalton and for communications he's been doing most of the posting for the school committee and district and then each school has. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=618.908s">a</a>  person who is responsible for their local news as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=622.83s">So</a>  I just wanted to give credit there. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=625.912s">All</a>  of them are returning at the school level except for Sarah Grant is new this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=634.103s">I</a>  did want to just sort of as background information I checked the Google Analytics on the site I thought that it might be interesting just to kind of see how widely used the site is. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=644.01s">I</a>  did this was back on, it was a couple days ago, and it was represents a 28 days previous so a four week period. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=653.157s">The</a>  thing that I'd like to point out is that on school days, typically between 1,000 and 1,500 people do use the website, the dips or the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=664.548s">So</a>  we do have quite a large number of users, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=669.032s">Before</a>  the launch of the new website, the usage was very, very low of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=675.738s">It</a>  would kind of appear at a flat line down at the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=680.101s">And</a>  then just sort of some of the most popular pages on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=685.384s">The</a>  home page for the district school brains is second and the breakfast and lunch menu is always a popular item. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=696.009s">And</a>  then things like the printable school calendar, staff portal, staff directory, athletics, and some of the school home pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=705.782s">And</a>  again, this was for the four weeks leading up to October 8th. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=713.009s">Some</a>  of the recently added items to the website have been we've started using some of the social media feeds on the home page of the district site. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=726.321s">We</a>  now have the MPS Facebook <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=730.413s">account</a>  embedded. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=731.313s">This</a>  is a screenshot of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=734.215s">And</a>  so that's kind of the first of the embeds that we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=738.137s">We</a>  also now have the Athletics X, or formerly known as Twitter or whatever it is, embedded within the Athletics area of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=749.102s">I</a>  put the next one, Athletics Home Games Weekly Post, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=752.924s">trying</a>  to work out what that's going to look like, but trying to promote the athletics program more. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=758.545s">Students</a>  have taken a lead on that and trying to just make sure that some of the activities around the high school and other schools are sort of posted about, promoted. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=771.348s">And</a>  then another page that was recently created by the students is the CCSR page. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=775.769s">They</a>  lost their website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=776.83s">We</a>  have a <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=778.76s">a</a>  new page there and that we will, the students will be involved in creating a more complete website for the CCSR program. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=792.011s">In</a>  one of the things that was my understanding about what you would like to kind of discuss tonight, learn about, or this afternoon, is language translations. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=800.797s">And</a>  so there are language translations built into the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=806.861s">Currently,</a>  the five languages that we support, through Finalsight, we were able to purchase five language translations using a module called WEGLOTS. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=818.529s">So</a>  we have, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=820.834s">Brazilian</a>  Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Arabic, Spanish, and French. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=827.86s">You</a>  can see that in the screenshot is the superintendent's memo translated into Haitian Creole. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=834.986s">I</a>  see a hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=835.847s">Is</a>  that member McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=840.711s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=841.532s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=842.212s">This</a>  looks really great. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=843.193s">I</a>  just wanted to ask, while we're on the page, where does one see the option for translation? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=848.898s">So,</a>  for example, if I am a Portuguese-speaking family, I get to the website, where do I see that I'm able to translate it?</p>

    <p>[X1f0jMHGEbc_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=857.324s">So</a>  it's down in the lower right-hand corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=859.326s">Let</a>  me see. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=860.927s">I'm</a>  not sure if it's going to let me change tabs. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=863.95s">Can</a>  you see the... <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=866.325s">yeah</a>  when I just change Okay, so if you go down to the lower right and you click on the ink the US flag that says English next to it you'll see the languages that are available, and then you can choose the language all the navigation is, then you see if I can just switch over to. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=884.637s">So</a>  now it's all in Portuguese. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=888.059s">So</a>  it is down in the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=889.44s">I</a>  think one of the things, I think your question is important because we haven't really promoted this feature. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=897.105s">And</a>  maybe that would be something that as we think about kind of next steps, promoting, educating about this feature would probably be a good thing to do.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=910.64s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=911.2s">Thank</a>  you, member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=912.221s">Just,</a>  I would agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=913.682s">I</a>  think that's fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=915.424s">I</a>  think it's wonderful. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=916.144s">It's</a>  a feature I didn't know about and one I definitely would want to share with families. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=919.707s">So</a>  marketing and outreach for that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=922.649s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=923.489s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=925.751s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[X1f0jMHGEbc_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=928.88s">Okay,</a>  and then I know another topic was accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=933.946s">We</a>  do try to follow best practices for accessibility on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=938.571s">So,</a>  what I mean by that are things like alt tags for images, so that <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=943.977s">If</a>  somebody is using a screen reader and can't see the image. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=947.742s">There</a>  is a description of what is in the image proper heading usage, so that screen readers can organize the their presentation of the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=960.362s">I</a>  have to say, I am not an expert on screen readers. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=962.403s">I</a>  just try to follow the guidelines that I've learned. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=966.486s">So</a>  my understanding is that the heading, proper use of heading is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=972.49s">Issues</a>  like color contrast, making sure that there's enough contrast between the different colors that are used in text and navigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=981.662s">and</a>  making sure that important text, if it is in an image, that we also duplicate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=986.805s">And</a>  so the reason that I picked this particular screenshot for this slide is the unified basketball schedule came to us as a PDF that wouldn't be automatically translated or screen-readable. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1000.153s">And</a>  so we took the text out of that and put it as part of the text of the news post so that it could be screen-read and that it could be <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1010.719s">translated</a>  into the different languages. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1013.501s">Sometimes</a>  we will post a graphic that is kind of nicely designed, maybe it's a dance announcement, the neon dance is coming, they have a really colorful graphic for that, but we'll make sure that any information such as the date, the time, the cost, that kind of thing is also in text so that screen readers can't read the text that's in an image. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1036.283s">And</a>  so that allows screen readers and translation to have access to the text that's important for that particular post or information. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1045.621s">And</a>  we know that there are still issues that need to be addressed around accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1051.367s">So</a>  there are PDFs that we have and we post that are not translatable or screen readable. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1059.695s">Images</a>  that contain important text. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1061.317s">Again,</a>  I did say that we do try to make sure that in our posts we pull out the important information. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1068.604s">We</a>  have not fully tested the website, using assistive technology screen readers or other assistive technologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1075.787s">I</a>  think that that would be, I would love to invite somebody into the classroom and who uses assistive technologies of any kind and <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1085.411s">talk</a>  with them, learn about their experience using the website, let them explore the website, learn from them, and possibly have some, like a screen reader accessible to us so that we can also just, when we create a new page, what would it look, what would it sound like to have it read to us? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1100.683s">So</a>  those are some things. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1102.024s">We're</a>  open to suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1103.285s">We</a>  know that this is still an area that we have, you know, we could improve upon. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1110.635s">And</a>  I think part of that is the website, but part of that also is the materials that we are given to put onto the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1117.359s">So</a>  that's a kind of a two-sided point there. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1120.98s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, did you have a question?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1126.445s">Yes,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1128.226s">No,</a>  I think this is really great too and appreciate your thoughtfulness and the students thoughtfulness about this and I'm really excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1136.108s">For</a>  the alt tags for images, if you could just demonstrate how that works, that would be really helpful at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1143.27s">And</a>  then regarding the testing with the assistive technologies, I think that's a fantastic idea and would really encourage working with the high school transition program and the team there. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1157.598s">And</a>  I'm sure that they can support and also Easterseals <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1160.709s">is</a>  super supportive with assistive tech, and I'm happy to connect folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1164.492s">But</a>  I think having more than one self-advocate navigate and sort of work even with your team to help them understand how a person with a disability navigates a website would be fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1179.045s">And</a>  as far as the screen reader goes, I think that's definitely something that's a great idea too, to be able to listen and try it out yourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1187.292s">with</a>  the incorporation of a self-advocate, I think, or more than one self-advocate, I think would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1193.854s">you</a>  know, I'm happy to do a little bit of research on the screen reader if you're interested, but would you be able to demonstrate an alt tag?</p>

    <p>[X1f0jMHGEbc_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1200.898s">An</a>  alt tag is really, it's something that's inside of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1206.981s">It's</a>  not something that a user would see. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1210.143s">So</a>  it's a little bit hard for me to demonstrate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1212.204s">What</a>  it would be is that if a screen reader encounters an image, the alt tag, there's an image tag that puts an image on a page. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1222.591s">The</a>  alt tag would say, photograph of two students playing soccer, or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1231.315s">And</a>  so instead of being able to see the image, the screen reader would read the text that's in the alt tag. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1241.343s">I</a>  can't really show it at this point.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1243.324s">No,</a>  I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1245.366s">It's</a>  coding then for the screen reader to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1247.907s">Okay,</a>  that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1248.928s">And</a>  so with somebody with a screen reader can sort of go over that and it would read to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1253.031s">That's</a>  helpful explanation, especially for... <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1255.327s">lay</a>  people who are listening and people like me who haven't used alt images or alt descriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1260.653s">So</a>  that's super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1262.314s">And</a>  I think to your point, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1264.256s">Miller,</a>  about uniformity around submissions is a really good point, especially when it comes to accessibility and ADA and language and what have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1274.207s">So</a>  thank you for that food for thought.</p>

    <p>[X1f0jMHGEbc_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1276.718s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1277.659s">And</a>  thank you for the resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1279.8s">And</a>  if you do have any information on screen reader, screen reader suggestions or recommendations, please let me know. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1287.747s">And</a>  I think reaching out to the high school transition program is a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1291.229s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1292.971s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1293.531s">Miller,</a>  I will also check with my team here at work. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1298.695s">We</a>  do a lot of build of e-learning content. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1302.678s">And</a>  when you build <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1305.407s">those</a>  kinds of resources, particularly for use in state government, the agencies are typically very interested in making sure there's section 508 compliance, which is all the things that you're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1319.192s">So</a>  it's making sure that anybody who is needing to use that resource can access it. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1326.134s">And</a>  the sticky part about 508 compliance is that it is in the eye of the beholder. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1331.316s">So</a>  there is no set of rules that says like, yes, check, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1335.297s">this</a>  is 508 compliant, what you can do is you can sort of test for the things that are the most common. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1342.079s">Nope,</a>  508. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1343.539s">So</a>  it's a set of standards that govern the sort of digital publication of material. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1354.742s">And</a>  one of the things that state agencies grapple with certainly is when they're providing these kinds of <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1363.74s">whether</a>  it's websites, whether it's e-learning, what have you, that they sort of have to take a best effort approach to cover as many bases of best practice as they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1375.452s">And</a>  then if there are individuals who require something particular, then the goal is to like <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1385.402s">individually</a>  meet that person where they are, because there is no standard for what you need to be able to access the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1393.367s">So</a>  a lot of times when we talk about 508 compliance, you know, there's there's sort of rules of the road, like you talked about, like <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1402.132s">making</a>  sure a screen reader can read alt tags. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1404.835s">And</a>  that takes a whole body of work, right, to alt tag everything, really be thoughtful about PDFs and things like that, color contrast, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1413.062s">There</a>  is a best, there are like guidelines that sort of get you there probably like 90, 95, 96, 97% of the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1422.21s">And</a>  it's this website certainly sets up all of that very nicely, I think, to the to the sort of point in conversation around the information that you're receiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1434.186s">I</a>  do think there's probably an opportunity for us to communicate. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1440.814s">these</a>  best practices in terms of what you need and how you need it to make life easier for everybody who's going to post things. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1449.18s">So,</a>  I mean, you know, Tom is going to know these things, you're going to know these things, but somebody who's like, Hey, can you post this on the website? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1456.044s">Here's</a>  a flyer. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1456.725s">Um,</a>  even if they're able to give you like, here's the image and here's the details, like that makes it easier for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1462.749s">So</a>  I think there probably are some standards to think about as this, as we talk about next iteration, that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1470.814s">for</a>  the team to put together to say hey if you're going to give us information here's here's how we would like you to give it to us and here's why because people would never you know most people would never think about like how would I describe this photo I just I'm looking at it right and so that take that's all a bunch of that's a body of work that has to happen in order to make this <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1494.667s">accessible</a>  on an ongoing basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1496.569s">So</a>  I think some of those like sort of ideas around like how you want to receive information would be really sort of helpful for all the people that are trying to feed you stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1507.826s">Tom?</a> </p>

    <p>[Thomas Dalton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1509.608s">Yeah,</a>  thank you member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1511.369s">I'm</a>  glad that you honed in on this idea of, you know, having consistent expectations for how this content should be coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1520.957s">And</a>  that's something we're already working on with our principals with our subject directors and coordinators and with our posting. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1530.405s">designees,</a>  making sure that everybody has clear expectations about what kind of information is needed to add something to the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1539.63s">And</a>  that's up to and including thinking about these accessibility best practices that Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1545.293s">Miller</a>  outlined and that we know we <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1548.476s">still</a>  have a lot more work we can do on. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1550.938s">But</a>  it's definitely a major priority, because when we think about consistency of our content and our content being useful and accessible to all members of our community, we're very interested in really prioritizing these matters of visual accessibility, of other kinds of disability accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1571.67s">So</a>  it's a huge priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1573.991s">It's</a>  something I think that we're still developing all of the parameters for, but definitely top of mind for us as we're instituting these processes for developing this kind of content.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1586.197s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1586.617s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1587.037s">I</a>  appreciate that so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1590.699s">This</a>  is such an evolution from where we were not that long ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1594.92s">So</a>  we're like zooming light years ahead, which is really exciting to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1599.482s">Remember</a>  McLaughlin?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1601.963s">It</a>  is exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1602.844s">It's</a>  been a banner week with the disability awareness event and this, I'm so happy to see all of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1610.83s">And</a>  also just to that point, I know that the superintendent is working with the New England ADA organization and the executive director there on matters related to accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1627.842s">And</a>  I'm sure that they would also be a great <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1631.454s">source</a>  of information for accessibility and websites, and there was a grant written around some of this, and I don't think it just pertains, as some people might think, you know, it's regarding physical accessibility or other, it includes, you know, all accessibility and the website would be included on this, so there could be, you know, if the grant comes through, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1653.775s">Um,</a>  there could be some additional funding to help with this too, which is always the bottom line, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1659.12s">Um,</a>  is where's, where's the money coming from as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1661.623s">But,</a>  um, and in regarding the students and all the work that you guys have done, you know, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1668.129s">I</a>  think you have great material for your resume and for your college applications and being able to share this. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1675.375s">So</a>  thank you so much for all the hard work that you've put into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1678.358s">And</a>  please don't underestimate the value of talking about the accessibility when you're sharing the work that you did on the website and how you made it both language accessible and individually accessible. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1689.488s">I</a>  think that's super important in your applications too. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1692.35s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1695.824s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1696.004s">Miller,</a>  I think you have some additional slides. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1698.205s">We'll</a>  stop interrupting you.</p>

    <p>[X1f0jMHGEbc_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1701.787s">No,</a>  I'm happy to hear the conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1704.348s">This</a>  is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1705.709s">I</a>  don't really have a lot more, but I do have a little and this is a rather big page. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1711.892s">So</a>  thinking about possible phase two items. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1716.534s">So</a>  really building on the accessibility should also be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1722.137s">But</a>  thinking about ways of including more social media, we do have the ability to embed 20 social media feeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1730.161s">We're</a>  using two, as I had pointed out earlier, with the district Facebook and the athletics Twitter. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1736.904s">We're</a>  currently thinking that each of the schools will have a Facebook page, I mean, a Facebook embed on their main page. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1745.488s">And</a>  we're, we're thinking about Instagram I think the students support the, the idea of Instagram as being an additional social media feed that might be more appealing to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1760.615s">Kind</a>  of a bigger topic about how we are going to move forward with social media Thomas has been great and helping initiate some of this and thinking, helping us think about it both in terms of what we want to do as well as some of the guidelines around social media use. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1777.911s">So</a>  that has been very helpful staff directory procedures. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1782.99s">This</a>  is really about we have 800 employees listed in our staff directory on the website, and having some streamlined systems for keeping that up that directory up to date, making sure that I'm getting the information about new hires, you know titles where they, you know, school location. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1804.758s">department,</a>  and as well as when somebody leaves making sure that I get the information to remove them from the website so that that staff directory does continue to be up to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1816.796s">So</a>  that's a little bit of a challenge and it's more of a. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1820.831s">kind</a>  of a logistics challenge, I think, but something that I would like to see addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1825.613s">Library</a>  module, currently we're using an external website called LibGuide for the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1834.077s">And</a>  we would like to bring a lot of those resources that are particularly student-oriented into the final site main website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1842.221s">And</a>  just this week, we've heard from Andrew's middle school librarian, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1848.624s">saying</a>  that she would like access for her students easy, accessible resources for the middle school students. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1855.047s">So</a>  we will be working on that also soon and having that built into the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1859.91s">I</a>  think the staff portal needs some attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1864.772s">It's</a>  not awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1866.573s">But</a>  really, when we were launching, it fell to low priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1870.635s">Really,</a>  the community outward looking <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1875.057s">website</a>  was more important was prioritized I think appropriately so but I think a little attention to the staff portal thinking about what information is there how better to organize and present it would be beneficial to the staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1890.083s">We</a>  have been looking at ways of adding additional online or <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1894.431s">We're</a>  not looking at it yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1895.371s">We're</a>  open to adding, I should say, more online payment forms. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1899.193s">We</a>  currently have online payments for athletic user fees and AP exam fees. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1905.015s">We</a>  also used online payments for summer school payments, and I think that went really well. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1910.777s">But</a>  we do have this ability, and so thinking about additional uses for the online payments. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1918.2s">We've</a>  talked about with the students having an interest in possibly establishing more of an internship definition for some of the what the student website team does. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1934.89s">A</a>  lot of the <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1937.634s">vocational</a>  programs have internships or co-ops the senior year and maybe thinking about the student website team more as an internship. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1946.343s">So</a>  maybe exploring some possibilities there they they contribute a tremendous amount and thinking about how we think of them and label that kind of role and. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1957.981s">Kind</a>  of thinking about that I think would be a nice part to something nice to include in phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1963.266s">And</a>  then also thinking more about student focused content and resources on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1968.671s">What</a>  are the students looking for? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1970.953s">The</a>  students shared some good ideas just yesterday with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1976.378s">If</a>  they wanted to address, I'm not sure if they want to say anything about that or if I can just say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1984.704s">But</a>  they, well, I'll say it, and then if you guys want to add more, how about that? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=1988.926s">So</a>  two of the areas that came up were additional information about clubs and activities, how to get involved more, when clubs meet, all of that kind of stuff, as well as additional mental health resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2003.215s">So</a>  those were two categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2004.475s">I</a>  don't know if the students want to add anything to that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2015.325s">Oh,</a>  about like the clubs and like, like the stuff we want to like add to like the website, I guess like, we just want like the clubs to be more like relevant on the website, like how I'm like a couple clubs, like the meetings usually get like, flipped, like usually get like a random day, and they don't like announce it, or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2031.148s">So</a>  we kind of like want it, like the website to be a bit more like club focused, where like we there's more information. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2036.73s">Um,</a>  also, I don't remember this was mentioned, but maybe more like mental health resources on the website to like help students.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2046.084s">Thank</a>  you, Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2046.952s">Thank</a>  you, Rachel.</p>

    <p>[X1f0jMHGEbc_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2050.752s">And</a>  in terms, and I would love to hear more about what students are looking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2055.394s">I</a>  think that it has potential to really provide information and resources to students. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2062.936s">I</a>  think that, and that's an area that I think we're a little bit weak on right now, and that there's a lot of potential for growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2069.677s">And</a>  really we're open to suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2072.558s">This</a>  website is for the community, all aspects of the community, whether it's students, family, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2080.259s">staff.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2081.08s">So</a>  we're very open to suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2084.442s">And</a>  then, just a little more. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2089.164s">Just</a>  to make sure that everybody knows that a piece of all of this is that there is a mobile app that is available right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2097.543s">I</a>  took this screenshot you can see the top event is on the news is today's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2104.212s">So</a>  the mobile app is available. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2106.636s">It</a>  does show calendar events, news, it has access to the lunch menu school brains. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2114.935s">I</a>  want to make sure that we kind of keep the knowledge that this is a piece of the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2120.959s">It</a>  draws directly from the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2123.001s">There's</a>  nothing additional that we do to maintain the mobile app. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2127.444s">It</a>  pulls directly all of the information from the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2131.727s">So</a>  if we add a post to the website, it automatically becomes available on the mobile app. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2138.652s">It</a>  is there, it is in the Play Store and the Apple App Store. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2143.814s">There</a>  is one issue with on some phones with being able to select the high school as the location you would like to filter on because we have such a long name. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2154.098s">It</a>  is doable, but it's a little bit, I don't know, it needs to be improved. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2161.961s">But</a>  we haven't, you know, I think that there's been some information that's gone out about the mobile app, but it hasn't really been <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2168.22s">pushed</a>  a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2169.6s">It's</a>  definitely been included in the superintendent's memo, if I remember correctly, but I just wanted to make sure that that was not forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2177.543s">And</a>  then the last slide I have, the last two are really just thank yous, and I just wanted to thank the school committee of the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2185.085s">Diane</a>  Caldwell is not here today, but she's been really taking the lead on so many aspects of the website development. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2192.687s">Molly</a>  Leighton, director of technology, Thomas, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2196.068s">who's</a>  here, and then the posting teams, and the student website team, and just everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2203.49s">It's</a>  been a team effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2205.15s">There's</a>  been a lot of people involved that have helped to bring the website to where it is now, and we'll continue to make it better as we go forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2213.252s">So</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2214.612s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2216.312s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2216.872s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, did you have a question?</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2220.853s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2221.173s">What</a>  is the name of the mobile app? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2222.494s">Is</a>  it just Medford Public Schools? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2224.194s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2225.589s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2228.977s">Um,</a>  so I think we, when we brought this to the school committee, we definitely, um, were interested in exploring a little bit more about phase two. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2238.921s">And</a>  so I, um, and there were a couple of things that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2243.804s">Um,</a>  sort of piqued my interest as you were talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2247.405s">Um,</a>  and, and that I've heard about, um, and actually I invited, uh, miss Perry today as well, because I think we couple of things that we've heard at the school committee over. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2258.71s">the</a>  course of this last year is that some of the athletic teams are like, they're sort of like out there on their own for a whole variety of reasons, sort of managing their own websites where they're like sort of posting all of their community right like their <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2277.941s">Their</a>  track results their information for teams, etc. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2283.764s">One</a>  of the parents on the track team brought that to my attention that the track coach was like sort of maintaining this website on his own at his own expense and I, I certainly don't think that we. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2294.048s">sort</a>  of asked him to do that, but I imagine that he did it at a time when our website was really not very functional and he wanted a way to sort of provide all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2303.432s">And</a>  so that to me was one of the reasons why I invited Miss Perry is because I think all of the athletic teams and to <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2312.455s">to</a>  Rachel's point earlier, our extracurriculars all have potentially the same sort of use case and need to be able to have a space that can sort of live underneath the auspices of our overall website and be nimble and easy enough for people to post, but still informative. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2336.639s">So</a>  that we don't have, and one thing that does concern me from a <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2340.16s">sort</a>  of security perspective is like we don't have people out on all kinds of websites all over the place posting information that may or may not conform to sort of the guidelines that we would use to manage our own internal website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2354.25s">So</a>  one question I think I had for this group from a phase two perspective is <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2360.194s">Like,</a>  is there an opportunity to take that as a body of work around athletics and the extracurriculars and figure out really a process by which those pages can exist and can exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2376.823s">with</a>  the right like parameters and controls in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2379.985s">And</a>  I wanted Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2381.426s">Perry</a>  to be here for sure because obviously there are some tentacles there with athletics. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2386.789s">So</a>  I would just be interested in any thoughts that the team has around whether that is something that's viable for us to be thinking about as part of a phase two.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2398.037s">Sure,</a>  I can speak to the athletic piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2400.118s">So</a>  we have what we call our school today and our scheduling, our registration site, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2406.789s">We</a>  have team pages where I post all of our scores, all of the rosters are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2413.273s">So</a>  all of that information is housed there and it is linked from our final site to our athletics pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2421.778s">The</a>  only thing we really don't have is a specific page where we have news from our athletic activities, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2430.219s">maybe</a>  doing a highlight of, thank you for bringing that up, maybe doing a highlight of certain games or doing a highlight of coaches or a highlight of students or captains. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2440.421s">So</a>  maybe having a specific athletic news page where we can kind of do some of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2446.563s">But</a>  I think for at least the scheduling piece, the rosters, the scores, all of that stuff is kind of housed in that our school where that is also linked on that side. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2458.066s">Yep,</a>  that's the schedule that you see there. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2460.647s">Um,</a>  and those are all links. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2462.508s">So</a>  when we have registration open, for example, winter registration, we open in a couple of weeks, we have students that register for hockey that signals our activity schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2474.453s">Let</a>  us say, okay, kids are scheduled for hockey. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2476.454s">Let's</a>  post that hockey schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2477.895s">So</a>  it's all kind of intertwined. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2480.056s">And</a>  when I do rosters, I pulled from the registration site, the kids that registered for hockey, I pull that over to the hockey roster. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2487.503s">And</a>  then that all gets pushed over to our facility scheduler. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2490.484s">So</a>  like I said, it's kind of a big web there, but for our need, I would definitely say getting that news out. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2497.666s">I</a>  do ads on Twitter every week about our upcoming games. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2503.627s">We</a>  have pictures of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2505.948s">Thank</a>  you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2508.289s">That</a>  was actually the crew team just had a meet on Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2512.73s">So</a>  that was their information, but I try to do, or I do every week, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2516.907s">you</a>  can see boys, freshmen soccer there. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2519.088s">We</a>  do ads and we push that out to Twitter. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2522.009s">I</a>  also send it to coaches so they can push it out to Facebook and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2526.851s">But</a>  that's what I have for my end.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2530.543s">Thank</a>  you, Rachel. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2531.264s">I</a>  guess one of the things that I don't know a lot about from a final site perspective is whether there are integrations available that would make some of these connections easier so that everybody can sort of work in the native place that they work. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2548.156s">And</a>  it doesn't have to be like so labor intensive to sort of move information to final sites. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2554.021s">So</a>  in other words, like this final site have some sort of integration that would work with <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2558.806s">Is</a>  it our school where all of the athletics work is happening and then can, is there some like more integrated way on the back end for the website to organically take the information that is being populated and managed in our school or whatever it's called? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2578.931s">on</a>  the athletic side. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2579.992s">So</a>  I didn't know what kind of integrations were available with final site that we should be thinking about taking advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2585.435s">And</a>  those always are like sort of meaty projects that would definitely to your point of like internships and things like that, those sort of lend themselves to that kind of thinking a little bit more.</p>

    <p>[X1f0jMHGEbc_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2595.32s">And</a>  I will say that final site does provide an athletics module. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2600.083s">They</a>  do <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2602.583s">say</a>  that they have integration I'm not sure when we look it looked like maybe they were almost there but not quite there so it might be something where in the future that integration might be a little bit cleaner. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2615.217s">I</a>  think it's something we need to stay abreast of and keep an eye on what final site is offering it is an additional fee. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2625.151s">I</a>  forget what it was, but it wasn't, it was like $5,000 a year or something for the integration. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2630.574s">Um,</a>  I'm not sure but it was in that range, plus or minus some amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2637.31s">So</a>  it is something that we've looked at a little bit, but looking at, after talking with Rachel and trying to understand more about the complexity of scheduling, rosters, facility management, all of that, Rachel can say more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2653.497s">It</a>  became clear that the current tool, you know, what final site was currently offering wasn't quite there, but we are optimistic that <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2661.954s">I</a>  think that that could be a future thing but we're also looking at ways of like, like the page that we're looking at right now where we are able to Rachel updates, the Twitter feed or X feed or whatever it's called. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2676.352s">And</a>  then we're able to embed that on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2681.929s">We've</a>  been looking at ways of, you know, highlighting, promoting home games. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2687.352s">I</a>  like Rachel's idea about highlighting, you know, teams or coaches or players. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2695.056s">So</a>  kind of, I think the idea of maybe an athletics specific news might be a nice idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2703.721s">So</a>  I think that there are definitely things we can do and hopefully eventually we could move toward that more integrated, <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2712.315s">kind</a>  of module using the module that final site provides. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2715.837s">I'm</a>  not sure if Rachel has anything to add to that, but that's sort of kind of where I feel like we landed when we've had this conversation.</p>

    <p>[Perry]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2724.381s">Yes,</a>  I agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2725.922s">I</a>  think there was a couple of things that wouldn't really be transferred over. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2730.284s">So</a>  we were kind of waiting to see what would happen if they could, you know, do that in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2735.467s">But</a>  I totally agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2736.707s">I</a>  think maybe, you know, wait to see what happens with them and then <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2740.325s">if</a>  it can be integrated, then we do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2743.706s">I</a>  think what was happening too, with our school today, you can actually load all of the schedules onto a Google calendar, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2755.491s">So</a>  I think that's, but we couldn't go the other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2757.712s">So</a>  I think that was a glitch too. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2760.053s">Right,</a>  Lisa, if I remember.</p>

    <p>[X1f0jMHGEbc_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2762.174s">Yeah,</a>  that sounds familiar, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2764.395s">I'm</a>  not a hundred percent, but that sounds right.</p>

    <p>[Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2768.137s">Got</a>  it so and maybe the the right sort of implementation approach is to start with the some of the clubs and activities that don't really have a presence right now and work out sort of how that. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2783.936s">can</a>  work, whether it's like student students to have access to post on behalf of their clubs or that's something the advisors do, but I would imagine like as you do that there's some like rules of the road that come out right in terms of how to make it as effective as possible and then. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2801.815s">Maybe</a>  like the next phase could ultimately be like when this integration is available from an athletics perspective we sort of bring the rest of the athletics teams along that same pathway that we've worked out with, with the extracurriculars, and I will say that final site.</p>

    <p>[X1f0jMHGEbc_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2819.793s">has</a>  really a lot of different levels of permissions and we like let's say we did say okay students for different clubs could post on a club's board or something, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2833.965s">It's</a>  really easy to set up where they wouldn't have access to anything other than just that one, you know, board that they could post to. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2843.57s">So</a>  that we don't open ourselves up to a larger number of people potentially having access to other areas of the website that we just, you know, for security reasons, we don't want everybody to have access to.</p>

    <p>[Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2861.184s">Oh,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2863.388s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2863.769s">Yeah,</a>  and I think to that, I think those are. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2867.631s">are</a>  really great points. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2868.931s">Member</a>  Graham, in terms of the phase two and thinking about the integration and also the groups that are not represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2875.534s">And</a>  in addition to that, to Thomas's role in sort of all of this as well as sort of the uniformity and be able to create some standardization and standards of some of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2889.498s">And</a>  so, for example, you know, we have approved and required a <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2896.52s">non-discrimination</a>  statement for all sign-ups for any activity of the life of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2902.122s">So,</a>  you know, whenever there's a form that goes out to sign up for an athletic event or to get tickets for a dance or, you know, any of those things that there's a non-discrimination statement that says, you know, Medford does not discriminate on the basis of all the things that we don't discriminate on. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2918.067s">And</a>  if you need accommodations, here is the path to, you know, request accommodations to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2924.276s">And</a>  that, again, was going to be out 9-1. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2927.737s">And</a>  I think that, you know, just with the start of the school year, it's been a little bit delayed, but that's coming and it should be uniform on everything that's the life of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2935.919s">So</a>  I would imagine, you know, maybe that's part of Thomas's role in some of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2941.26s">If</a>  not, I would like to know whose it is or whose it would be just in terms of uniformity in messaging or approval, I guess, or something.</p>

    <p>[Thomas Dalton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2951.656s">Yeah,</a>  definitely part of my role, Member McLaughlin, and actually just circulated a memo with building principals this week reminding them that that should be included on all the appropriate web pages and most of all on flyers and sign up forms for events to affirmatively remind that we offer all reasonable accommodations to anybody who needs them for any event. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2981.124s">So</a>  yeah, that's an important point and something that we're definitely on top of.</p>

    <p>[McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2987.688s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2987.988s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2988.288s">And</a>  if that could be added to the phase two of the website as well, that would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2992.57s">I</a>  know I did a search on it the other day and it hadn't happened yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=2996.512s">So</a>  I know that you guys are working super hard on it and I really appreciate all the effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3002.115s">And</a>  member Graham, I'm sure you're thinking of this, but just sort of wondering if there'll be another FCE meeting regarding phase two <a href="https://youtu.be/95wursjg8MQ&t=3010.936s">you</a>  know, the implementation of phase two.</p>
