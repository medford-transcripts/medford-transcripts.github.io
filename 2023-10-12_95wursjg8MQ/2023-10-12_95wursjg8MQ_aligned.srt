1
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:16,114
Hi everyone, this is Melanie.

2
00:00:16,134 --> 00:00:16,834
How are you guys doing?

3
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:20,355
Can you hear me okay?

4
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:23,496
Yeah, I can't hear you guys, so I'm gonna try to troubleshoot this for a minute.

5
00:00:24,077 --> 00:00:26,817
Hi, can you hear me?

6
00:00:26,837 --> 00:00:28,198
Yeah, I can hear you.

7
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:31,461
Wait, I have a glare in my background.

8
00:00:31,481 --> 00:00:32,802
Let me just try to shut a shade.

9
00:00:32,862 --> 00:00:36,024
It's like really it's like the light is coming towards me.

10
00:00:36,084 --> 00:00:36,425
Hold on.

11
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:38,286
Let me go shut that.

12
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:40,027
I'm in a different location.

13
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:42,189
I don't have my usual spot.

14
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:43,990
That's okay.

15
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:48,554
My camera is not cooperating today.

16
00:00:49,389 --> 00:00:51,131
It just shows a brown screen.

17
00:00:51,171 --> 00:01:02,062
I don't know what's brown, but I will spare you the brown square and just leave my camera off, sadly, because that's how my day's been going.

18
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:23,759
Okay, Melanie, can you hear us now?

19
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:25,840
I can.

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:26,280
Thank you.

21
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,521
Okay, perfect.

22
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:34,346
I'm going to go ahead and start the meeting and read the meeting notice.

23
00:01:34,626 --> 00:01:45,233
Okay, please be advised that on Wednesday, October 11, at 4pm, there will be a family engagement and communication subcommittee meeting held through remote participation via zoom.

32
00:02:42,226 --> 00:02:42,987
Member Kratz.

33
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:46,272
Yes, sorry.

34
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:47,133
Yes.

35
00:02:48,315 --> 00:02:49,276
Member McLaughlin.

36
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:51,339
Here.

37
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:53,182
And Member Graham here.

38
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:54,724
So we have three present, none absent.

39
00:02:56,116 --> 00:03:05,599
Our agenda was set forward to us per our unanimous vote of the school committee on May 1st of 2023.

40
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:22,525
And it reads, whereas the school committee seeks to increase transparency and community engagement, and whereas Medford Public Schools has recently relaunched its website on a modernized platform that enables regular maintenance, be it resolved that the communications and family engagement subcommittee meet to discuss updates to the website

41
00:03:23,046 --> 00:03:29,509
that would promote family engagement, improve accessibility and ensure transparency for all MPS families and residents of Medford.

42
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,731
Be it further resolved that the communications and family engagement subcommittee will invite Ms.

43
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:39,433
Lisa Miller and her students to work to launch the site and are currently working on plans for phase two of development.

44
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,558
Um, so that is our agenda.

45
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:53,021
Um, and, um, by way of background, uh, for everybody on the call, um, with us, we had a presentation.

46
00:03:53,041 --> 00:04:01,585
Um, I believe it was right before may 1st from miss Miller and the students that worked on the initial phase of the, um, the website.

47
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:04,566
And during that meeting, um, what the, um,

48
00:04:07,987 --> 00:04:12,689
No, I heard the ideas for what the next phase might look like of the website.

49
00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:19,512
And so we wanted to have this discussion to really talk about sort of A, what is possible.

50
00:04:19,632 --> 00:04:20,772
So Ms.

51
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:24,393
Miller and her students are here and I want you to introduce everybody in just a second.

52
00:04:25,214 --> 00:04:33,097
So we wanna hear a little bit about what's possible and talk about what some of the ideas are amongst this subcommittee.

53
00:04:33,637 --> 00:04:35,378
And we're actually also thrilled to have

54
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:42,403
Mr Thomas Dalton with us who has joined us as the director of communications on behalf of the district.

55
00:04:42,503 --> 00:04:47,046
So we're super excited to have you working with us on this as well.

56
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:50,489
So Miss Miller, did you want to?

57
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,650
I saw that you sent me a presentation.

58
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,832
Did you want to start by introducing?

59
00:04:56,393 --> 00:05:00,276
Yourself and the team here so that we can hear a little bit about.

60
00:05:02,618 --> 00:05:04,079
The presentation you wanted to provide us.

61
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:16,693
Sure, and I'm, I'm Lisa Miller I teach programming and web development at Medford vocational technical high school, and I am the web administrator for the public Medford public schools website.

62
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:22,717
I have a team of wonderful students, five of them I think looking at the.

63
00:05:23,617 --> 00:05:36,389
Board the grid here, it looks like three of them are here today that are on the student website team, they are critical to the maintenance and updating and posting news on the website.

64
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:40,212
I would like to let them introduce themselves.

65
00:05:41,573 --> 00:05:45,574
I'm not sure I did share the presentation.

66
00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:55,117
I don't know if that would be useful for me to go through, or if you had more specific questions that you just wanted to jump right to, or if you wanted me to kind of go through the presentation also.

67
00:05:55,137 --> 00:06:03,539
I think go ahead and introduce, have everybody introduce themselves, and then I think we would love to hear from you all.

68
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:04,319
OK.

69
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,940
So Carolyn, why don't you start?

70
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,406
Hi, I'm Karen.

71
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,107
I'm the team manager of the website team.

72
00:06:15,847 --> 00:06:20,168
I just have to thank you for being here and work together with you all.

73
00:06:20,348 --> 00:06:21,128
Thank you so much.

74
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:22,489
Thank you.

75
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:30,350
Hi, I'm Tanza Ndesel.

76
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,711
I'm a senior and I'm also in computer programming in the website team.

77
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:38,976
I'm Rachel.

78
00:06:39,016 --> 00:06:41,222
I'm also a senior and also on the website team.

79
00:06:41,463 --> 00:06:42,546
Thank you so much for having us.

80
00:06:44,468 --> 00:06:45,588
We are thrilled to have you.

81
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:52,011
We love having students in our subcommittee meetings and at our regular meetings, but these are a little bit easier for people to get to, I think.

82
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:58,373
If they have to go to bed and go to school the next day, so.

83
00:06:58,393 --> 00:07:05,096
So Superintendent, I don't know if you wanted to say anything before we turn it over to Miss Miller to do a presentation.

84
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:12,118
Yes, I just want to say thank you Miss Miller for your leadership and for holding down the entire web.

85
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:29,123
All the work that's the back end on the website that we have and working with the students who are doing fabulous work I also wanted to share that I believe some of our students have had the opportunity to work with City Hall as well.

86
00:07:30,264 --> 00:07:30,924
In the past.

87
00:07:32,144 --> 00:07:37,849
So I hope that that work is able to continue happening, doing continued web work.

88
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:44,774
So I just want to congratulate them and encourage you to keep doing the wonderful work that all of you are doing.

89
00:07:44,854 --> 00:07:46,215
So thank you.

90
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:50,259
I look forward to seeing your brief presentation.

91
00:07:51,059 --> 00:08:03,882
I also just want to recognize, too, as part of the team, Thomas, who's working closely with all of us on the senior executive team side, helping us with furthering our communication.

92
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:15,784
So I'm very happy for the collaboration and partnership in how we are working to communicate as clearly and as effectively to the entire Medford community.

93
00:08:15,944 --> 00:08:17,745
So thank you to both of you.

94
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:18,945
Thank you.

95
00:08:22,216 --> 00:08:26,680
And I do believe Dr. Cushing made you a co-host, Ms.

96
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:33,606
Miller, so you should be able to share your slide deck to just point out some of the key highlights of the work that you're doing.

97
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:34,767
OK, great.

98
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:36,248
Should I go ahead and start?

99
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:37,770
Yeah, please do.

100
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:37,830
OK.

101
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,090
Let me.

102
00:08:47,521 --> 00:08:52,602
I have to say it's been a while since I've had to share on Zoom back from the COVID early days.

103
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:56,163
Can you see the slide presentation?

104
00:08:56,883 --> 00:08:57,023
Yep.

105
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:57,543
Yes.

106
00:08:57,643 --> 00:08:58,384
OK, great.

107
00:08:59,744 --> 00:09:01,845
Please don't hesitate to ask questions.

108
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:04,265
I am going to go through this fairly quickly.

109
00:09:05,105 --> 00:09:09,606
You can ask questions along the way, comment, or wait till I'm done, whatever works best.

110
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:12,907
And the students are available for questions as well.

111
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:16,108
So with that, let's see.

112
00:09:17,495 --> 00:09:18,056
See if I can.

113
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,741
OK, so there is the website team.

114
00:09:23,781 --> 00:09:27,845
There's two additional team members that did not have a chance to introduce themselves.

115
00:09:29,487 --> 00:09:32,209
Sekou Koyade and Vasilijas Tufis.

116
00:09:33,451 --> 00:09:38,335
They are both part of the team and part of the picture that you can see right here.

117
00:09:39,356 --> 00:09:41,899
And it's a really great student team.

118
00:09:43,573 --> 00:09:47,201
Um, I also wanted to just acknowledge that.

119
00:09:48,163 --> 00:09:53,415
So the students are the ones that are do and and I do a lot of the page update so if the.

120
00:09:54,989 --> 00:10:00,794
Lunch menu needs to be updated or information on any of the pages need to be updated the students do that.

121
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:17,309
And then they also do some of the posting in the various news areas, but the additional posting is done by Thomas Dalton and for communications he's been doing most of the posting for the school committee and district and then each school has.

122
00:10:18,908 --> 00:10:21,930
a person who is responsible for their local news as well.

123
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,832
So I just wanted to give credit there.

124
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:31,716
All of them are returning at the school level except for Sarah Grant is new this year.

125
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:43,450
I did want to just sort of as background information I checked the Google Analytics on the site I thought that it might be interesting just to kind of see how widely used the site is.

126
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:51,636
I did this was back on, it was a couple days ago, and it was represents a 28 days previous so a four week period.

127
00:10:53,157 --> 00:11:03,026
The thing that I'd like to point out is that on school days, typically between 1,000 and 1,500 people do use the website, the dips or the weekends.

128
00:11:04,548 --> 00:11:08,571
So we do have quite a large number of users, I think.

129
00:11:09,032 --> 00:11:14,917
Before the launch of the new website, the usage was very, very low of the website.

130
00:11:15,738 --> 00:11:18,680
It would kind of appear at a flat line down at the bottom.

131
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:24,704
And then just sort of some of the most popular pages on the website.

132
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:34,429
The home page for the district school brains is second and the breakfast and lunch menu is always a popular item.

133
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:43,653
And then things like the printable school calendar, staff portal, staff directory, athletics, and some of the school home pages.

134
00:11:45,782 --> 00:11:50,346
And again, this was for the four weeks leading up to October 8th.

135
00:11:53,009 --> 00:12:05,040
Some of the recently added items to the website have been we've started using some of the social media feeds on the home page of the district site.

136
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:08,223
We now have the MPS Facebook

137
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:11,293
account embedded.

138
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:13,435
This is a screenshot of it.

139
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:17,777
And so that's kind of the first of the embeds that we did.

140
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:27,501
We also now have the Athletics X, or formerly known as Twitter or whatever it is, embedded within the Athletics area of the website.

141
00:12:29,102 --> 00:12:32,144
I put the next one, Athletics Home Games Weekly Post,

142
00:12:32,924 --> 00:12:37,865
trying to work out what that's going to look like, but trying to promote the athletics program more.

143
00:12:38,545 --> 00:12:50,268
Students have taken a lead on that and trying to just make sure that some of the activities around the high school and other schools are sort of posted about, promoted.

144
00:12:51,348 --> 00:12:55,709
And then another page that was recently created by the students is the CCSR page.

145
00:12:55,769 --> 00:12:56,810
They lost their website.

146
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,490
We have a

147
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:09,706
a new page there and that we will, the students will be involved in creating a more complete website for the CCSR program.

148
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:20,697
In one of the things that was my understanding about what you would like to kind of discuss tonight, learn about, or this afternoon, is language translations.

149
00:13:20,797 --> 00:13:25,360
And so there are language translations built into the website.

150
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:38,229
Currently, the five languages that we support, through Finalsight, we were able to purchase five language translations using a module called WEGLOTS.

151
00:13:38,529 --> 00:13:39,050
So we have,

152
00:13:40,834 --> 00:13:47,820
Brazilian Portuguese, Haitian Creole, Arabic, Spanish, and French.

153
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:53,925
You can see that in the screenshot is the superintendent's memo translated into Haitian Creole.

154
00:13:54,986 --> 00:13:55,626
I see a hand.

155
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:58,569
Is that member McLaughlin?

156
00:14:00,711 --> 00:14:01,392
Thank you.

157
00:14:01,532 --> 00:14:02,132
Thank you so much.

158
00:14:02,212 --> 00:14:03,153
This looks really great.

159
00:14:03,193 --> 00:14:08,797
I just wanted to ask, while we're on the page, where does one see the option for translation?

160
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:16,624
So, for example, if I am a Portuguese-speaking family, I get to the website, where do I see that I'm able to translate it?

161
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,306
So it's down in the lower right-hand corner.

162
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:20,827
Let me see.

163
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,890
I'm not sure if it's going to let me change tabs.

164
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:24,910
Can you see the...

165
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:43,765
yeah when I just change Okay, so if you go down to the lower right and you click on the ink the US flag that says English next to it you'll see the languages that are available, and then you can choose the language all the navigation is, then you see if I can just switch over to.

166
00:14:44,637 --> 00:14:46,739
So now it's all in Portuguese.

167
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:49,400
So it is down in the corner.

168
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:56,965
I think one of the things, I think your question is important because we haven't really promoted this feature.

169
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:08,233
And maybe that would be something that as we think about kind of next steps, promoting, educating about this feature would probably be a good thing to do.

170
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,140
Thank you.

171
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,161
Thank you, member Graham.

172
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:13,662
Just, I would agree.

173
00:15:13,682 --> 00:15:15,003
I think that's fantastic.

174
00:15:15,424 --> 00:15:16,124
I think it's wonderful.

175
00:15:16,144 --> 00:15:19,667
It's a feature I didn't know about and one I definitely would want to share with families.

176
00:15:19,707 --> 00:15:22,569
So marketing and outreach for that would be great.

177
00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:23,009
Thank you.

178
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:23,690
Yeah.

179
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:26,231
Okay.

180
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,704
Okay, and then I know another topic was accessibility.

181
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:38,151
We do try to follow best practices for accessibility on the website.

182
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:42,716
So, what I mean by that are things like alt tags for images, so that

183
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,981
If somebody is using a screen reader and can't see the image.

184
00:15:47,742 --> 00:15:58,375
There is a description of what is in the image proper heading usage, so that screen readers can organize the their presentation of the information.

185
00:16:00,362 --> 00:16:02,343
I have to say, I am not an expert on screen readers.

186
00:16:02,403 --> 00:16:05,285
I just try to follow the guidelines that I've learned.

187
00:16:06,486 --> 00:16:10,869
So my understanding is that the heading, proper use of heading is important.

188
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:20,276
Issues like color contrast, making sure that there's enough contrast between the different colors that are used in text and navigation.

189
00:16:21,662 --> 00:16:26,785
and making sure that important text, if it is in an image, that we also duplicate it.

190
00:16:26,805 --> 00:16:39,613
And so the reason that I picked this particular screenshot for this slide is the unified basketball schedule came to us as a PDF that wouldn't be automatically translated or screen-readable.

191
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:49,859
And so we took the text out of that and put it as part of the text of the news post so that it could be screen-read and that it could be

192
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,721
translated into the different languages.

193
00:16:53,501 --> 00:17:15,838
Sometimes we will post a graphic that is kind of nicely designed, maybe it's a dance announcement, the neon dance is coming, they have a really colorful graphic for that, but we'll make sure that any information such as the date, the time, the cost, that kind of thing is also in text so that screen readers can't read the text that's in an image.

194
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:23,849
And so that allows screen readers and translation to have access to the text that's important for that particular post or information.

195
00:17:25,621 --> 00:17:31,247
And we know that there are still issues that need to be addressed around accessibility.

196
00:17:31,367 --> 00:17:38,955
So there are PDFs that we have and we post that are not translatable or screen readable.

197
00:17:39,695 --> 00:17:41,277
Images that contain important text.

198
00:17:41,317 --> 00:17:47,163
Again, I did say that we do try to make sure that in our posts we pull out the important information.

199
00:17:48,604 --> 00:17:54,967
We have not fully tested the website, using assistive technology screen readers or other assistive technologies.

200
00:17:55,787 --> 00:18:04,571
I think that that would be, I would love to invite somebody into the classroom and who uses assistive technologies of any kind and

201
00:18:05,411 --> 00:18:19,922
talk with them, learn about their experience using the website, let them explore the website, learn from them, and possibly have some, like a screen reader accessible to us so that we can also just, when we create a new page, what would it look, what would it sound like to have it read to us?

202
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:21,984
So those are some things.

203
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:23,205
We're open to suggestions.

204
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:29,610
We know that this is still an area that we have, you know, we could improve upon.

205
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:37,058
And I think part of that is the website, but part of that also is the materials that we are given to put onto the website.

206
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,860
So that's a kind of a two-sided point there.

207
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,662
Member McLaughlin, did you have a question?

208
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:47,145
Yes, thank you.

209
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:55,688
No, I think this is really great too and appreciate your thoughtfulness and the students thoughtfulness about this and I'm really excited about it.

210
00:18:56,108 --> 00:19:02,710
For the alt tags for images, if you could just demonstrate how that works, that would be really helpful at some point.

211
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:17,538
And then regarding the testing with the assistive technologies, I think that's a fantastic idea and would really encourage working with the high school transition program and the team there.

212
00:19:17,598 --> 00:19:20,079
And I'm sure that they can support and also Easterseals

213
00:19:20,709 --> 00:19:24,412
is super supportive with assistive tech, and I'm happy to connect folks.

214
00:19:24,492 --> 00:19:38,965
But I think having more than one self-advocate navigate and sort of work even with your team to help them understand how a person with a disability navigates a website would be fantastic.

215
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:46,212
And as far as the screen reader goes, I think that's definitely something that's a great idea too, to be able to listen and try it out yourselves.

216
00:19:47,292 --> 00:19:52,376
with the incorporation of a self-advocate, I think, or more than one self-advocate, I think would be great.

217
00:19:53,854 --> 00:20:00,037
you know, I'm happy to do a little bit of research on the screen reader if you're interested, but would you be able to demonstrate an alt tag?

218
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:06,841
An alt tag is really, it's something that's inside of the website.

219
00:20:06,981 --> 00:20:09,142
It's not something that a user would see.

220
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:12,164
So it's a little bit hard for me to demonstrate it.

221
00:20:12,204 --> 00:20:21,749
What it would be is that if a screen reader encounters an image, the alt tag, there's an image tag that puts an image on a page.

222
00:20:22,591 --> 00:20:30,955
The alt tag would say, photograph of two students playing soccer, or something like that.

223
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:39,319
And so instead of being able to see the image, the screen reader would read the text that's in the alt tag.

224
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,284
I can't really show it at this point.

225
00:20:43,324 --> 00:20:44,825
No, I understand.

226
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:47,827
It's coding then for the screen reader to read it.

227
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:48,888
Okay, that's great.

228
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:52,711
And so with somebody with a screen reader can sort of go over that and it would read to it.

229
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:54,612
That's helpful explanation, especially for...

230
00:20:55,327 --> 00:21:00,573
lay people who are listening and people like me who haven't used alt images or alt descriptions.

231
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:02,254
So that's super helpful.

232
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:04,216
And I think to your point, Ms.

233
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:14,167
Miller, about uniformity around submissions is a really good point, especially when it comes to accessibility and ADA and language and what have you.

234
00:21:14,207 --> 00:21:15,889
So thank you for that food for thought.

235
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:17,058
Thank you.

236
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:19,100
And thank you for the resources.

237
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:27,707
And if you do have any information on screen reader, screen reader suggestions or recommendations, please let me know.

238
00:21:27,747 --> 00:21:31,189
And I think reaching out to the high school transition program is a great idea.

239
00:21:31,229 --> 00:21:31,730
So thank you.

240
00:21:32,971 --> 00:21:33,491
And Ms.

241
00:21:33,531 --> 00:21:37,954
Miller, I will also check with my team here at work.

242
00:21:38,695 --> 00:21:42,438
We do a lot of build of e-learning content.

243
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:43,999
And when you build

244
00:21:45,407 --> 00:21:59,152
those kinds of resources, particularly for use in state government, the agencies are typically very interested in making sure there's section 508 compliance, which is all the things that you're talking about.

245
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:05,334
So it's making sure that anybody who is needing to use that resource can access it.

246
00:22:06,134 --> 00:22:10,896
And the sticky part about 508 compliance is that it is in the eye of the beholder.

247
00:22:11,316 --> 00:22:15,017
So there is no set of rules that says like, yes, check,

248
00:22:15,297 --> 00:22:21,879
this is 508 compliant, what you can do is you can sort of test for the things that are the most common.

249
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:22,899
Nope, 508.

250
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:33,882
So it's a set of standards that govern the sort of digital publication of material.

251
00:22:34,742 --> 00:22:42,084
And one of the things that state agencies grapple with certainly is when they're providing these kinds of

252
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:55,432
whether it's websites, whether it's e-learning, what have you, that they sort of have to take a best effort approach to cover as many bases of best practice as they can.

253
00:22:55,452 --> 00:23:04,341
And then if there are individuals who require something particular, then the goal is to like

254
00:23:05,402 --> 00:23:13,327
individually meet that person where they are, because there is no standard for what you need to be able to access the information.

255
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:21,132
So a lot of times when we talk about 508 compliance, you know, there's there's sort of rules of the road, like you talked about, like

256
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:24,654
making sure a screen reader can read alt tags.

257
00:23:24,835 --> 00:23:32,501
And that takes a whole body of work, right, to alt tag everything, really be thoughtful about PDFs and things like that, color contrast, et cetera.

258
00:23:33,062 --> 00:23:39,167
There is a best, there are like guidelines that sort of get you there probably like 90, 95, 96, 97% of the time.

259
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:54,166
And it's this website certainly sets up all of that very nicely, I think, to the to the sort of point in conversation around the information that you're receiving.

260
00:23:54,186 --> 00:23:59,913
I do think there's probably an opportunity for us to communicate.

261
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:09,120
these best practices in terms of what you need and how you need it to make life easier for everybody who's going to post things.

262
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:16,004
So, I mean, you know, Tom is going to know these things, you're going to know these things, but somebody who's like, Hey, can you post this on the website?

263
00:24:16,044 --> 00:24:16,705
Here's a flyer.

264
00:24:16,725 --> 00:24:22,709
Um, even if they're able to give you like, here's the image and here's the details, like that makes it easier for you.

265
00:24:22,749 --> 00:24:29,913
So I think there probably are some standards to think about as this, as we talk about next iteration, that would be helpful.

266
00:24:30,814 --> 00:24:53,647
for the team to put together to say hey if you're going to give us information here's here's how we would like you to give it to us and here's why because people would never you know most people would never think about like how would I describe this photo I just I'm looking at it right and so that take that's all a bunch of that's a body of work that has to happen in order to make this

267
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,469
accessible on an ongoing basis.

268
00:24:56,569 --> 00:25:06,444
So I think some of those like sort of ideas around like how you want to receive information would be really sort of helpful for all the people that are trying to feed you stuff.

269
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:08,106
Tom?

270
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,169
Yeah, thank you member Graham.

271
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:20,797
I'm glad that you honed in on this idea of, you know, having consistent expectations for how this content should be coming in.

272
00:25:20,957 --> 00:25:29,324
And that's something we're already working on with our principals with our subject directors and coordinators and with our posting.

273
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:38,810
designees, making sure that everybody has clear expectations about what kind of information is needed to add something to the website.

274
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:45,253
And that's up to and including thinking about these accessibility best practices that Ms.

275
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,295
Miller outlined and that we know we

276
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:50,617
still have a lot more work we can do on.

277
00:25:50,938 --> 00:26:10,910
But it's definitely a major priority, because when we think about consistency of our content and our content being useful and accessible to all members of our community, we're very interested in really prioritizing these matters of visual accessibility, of other kinds of disability accessibility.

278
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,331
So it's a huge priority.

279
00:26:13,991 --> 00:26:25,236
It's something I think that we're still developing all of the parameters for, but definitely top of mind for us as we're instituting these processes for developing this kind of content.

280
00:26:26,197 --> 00:26:26,457
Great.

281
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:26,977
Thank you.

282
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:28,998
I appreciate that so much.

283
00:26:30,699 --> 00:26:34,820
This is such an evolution from where we were not that long ago.

284
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,462
So we're like zooming light years ahead, which is really exciting to see.

285
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:40,363
Remember McLaughlin?

286
00:26:41,963 --> 00:26:42,764
It is exciting.

287
00:26:42,844 --> 00:26:49,909
It's been a banner week with the disability awareness event and this, I'm so happy to see all of this.

288
00:26:50,830 --> 00:27:07,602
And also just to that point, I know that the superintendent is working with the New England ADA organization and the executive director there on matters related to accessibility.

289
00:27:07,842 --> 00:27:10,284
And I'm sure that they would also be a great

290
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:33,057
source of information for accessibility and websites, and there was a grant written around some of this, and I don't think it just pertains, as some people might think, you know, it's regarding physical accessibility or other, it includes, you know, all accessibility and the website would be included on this, so there could be, you know, if the grant comes through,

291
00:27:33,775 --> 00:27:38,500
Um, there could be some additional funding to help with this too, which is always the bottom line, right?

292
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,603
Um, is where's, where's the money coming from as well.

293
00:27:41,623 --> 00:27:46,567
But, um, and in regarding the students and all the work that you guys have done, you know, um,

294
00:27:48,129 --> 00:27:55,295
I think you have great material for your resume and for your college applications and being able to share this.

295
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,838
So thank you so much for all the hard work that you've put into it.

296
00:27:58,358 --> 00:28:09,448
And please don't underestimate the value of talking about the accessibility when you're sharing the work that you did on the website and how you made it both language accessible and individually accessible.

297
00:28:09,488 --> 00:28:12,270
I think that's super important in your applications too.

298
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:12,891
So thank you.

299
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:15,984
Ms.

300
00:28:16,004 --> 00:28:18,165
Miller, I think you have some additional slides.

301
00:28:18,205 --> 00:28:19,526
We'll stop interrupting you.

302
00:28:21,787 --> 00:28:24,308
No, I'm happy to hear the conversation.

303
00:28:24,348 --> 00:28:25,089
This is great.

304
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:31,111
I don't really have a lot more, but I do have a little and this is a rather big page.

305
00:28:31,892 --> 00:28:34,513
So thinking about possible phase two items.

306
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:41,076
So really building on the accessibility should also be here.

307
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:50,121
But thinking about ways of including more social media, we do have the ability to embed 20 social media feeds.

308
00:28:50,161 --> 00:28:56,004
We're using two, as I had pointed out earlier, with the district Facebook and the athletics Twitter.

309
00:28:56,904 --> 00:29:04,668
We're currently thinking that each of the schools will have a Facebook page, I mean, a Facebook embed on their main page.

310
00:29:05,488 --> 00:29:18,474
And we're, we're thinking about Instagram I think the students support the, the idea of Instagram as being an additional social media feed that might be more appealing to the students.

311
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:37,071
Kind of a bigger topic about how we are going to move forward with social media Thomas has been great and helping initiate some of this and thinking, helping us think about it both in terms of what we want to do as well as some of the guidelines around social media use.

312
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:41,535
So that has been very helpful staff directory procedures.

313
00:29:42,990 --> 00:30:03,263
This is really about we have 800 employees listed in our staff directory on the website, and having some streamlined systems for keeping that up that directory up to date, making sure that I'm getting the information about new hires, you know titles where they, you know, school location.

314
00:30:04,758 --> 00:30:16,175
department, and as well as when somebody leaves making sure that I get the information to remove them from the website so that that staff directory does continue to be up to date.

315
00:30:16,796 --> 00:30:19,600
So that's a little bit of a challenge and it's more of a.

316
00:30:20,831 --> 00:30:24,653
kind of a logistics challenge, I think, but something that I would like to see addressed.

317
00:30:25,613 --> 00:30:32,677
Library module, currently we're using an external website called LibGuide for the high school.

318
00:30:34,077 --> 00:30:41,701
And we would like to bring a lot of those resources that are particularly student-oriented into the final site main website.

319
00:30:42,221 --> 00:30:48,324
And just this week, we've heard from Andrew's middle school librarian,

320
00:30:48,624 --> 00:30:55,027
saying that she would like access for her students easy, accessible resources for the middle school students.

321
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:59,890
So we will be working on that also soon and having that built into the website.

322
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:04,012
I think the staff portal needs some attention.

323
00:31:04,772 --> 00:31:05,853
It's not awful.

324
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,995
But really, when we were launching, it fell to low priority.

325
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,516
Really, the community outward looking

326
00:31:15,057 --> 00:31:28,023
website was more important was prioritized I think appropriately so but I think a little attention to the staff portal thinking about what information is there how better to organize and present it would be beneficial to the staff.

327
00:31:30,083 --> 00:31:33,325
We have been looking at ways of adding additional online or

328
00:31:34,431 --> 00:31:35,331
We're not looking at it yet.

329
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:39,113
We're open to adding, I should say, more online payment forms.

330
00:31:39,193 --> 00:31:44,695
We currently have online payments for athletic user fees and AP exam fees.

331
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:49,316
We also used online payments for summer school payments, and I think that went really well.

332
00:31:50,777 --> 00:31:56,879
But we do have this ability, and so thinking about additional uses for the online payments.

333
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:12,748
We've talked about with the students having an interest in possibly establishing more of an internship definition for some of the what the student website team does.

334
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,510
A lot of the

335
00:32:17,634 --> 00:32:26,082
vocational programs have internships or co-ops the senior year and maybe thinking about the student website team more as an internship.

336
00:32:26,343 --> 00:32:36,333
So maybe exploring some possibilities there they they contribute a tremendous amount and thinking about how we think of them and label that kind of role and.

337
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:42,705
Kind of thinking about that I think would be a nice part to something nice to include in phase two.

338
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:48,110
And then also thinking more about student focused content and resources on the website.

339
00:32:48,671 --> 00:32:50,873
What are the students looking for?

340
00:32:50,953 --> 00:32:55,397
The students shared some good ideas just yesterday with me.

341
00:32:56,378 --> 00:33:02,243
If they wanted to address, I'm not sure if they want to say anything about that or if I can just say it.

342
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:08,886
But they, well, I'll say it, and then if you guys want to add more, how about that?

343
00:33:08,926 --> 00:33:22,994
So two of the areas that came up were additional information about clubs and activities, how to get involved more, when clubs meet, all of that kind of stuff, as well as additional mental health resources.

344
00:33:23,215 --> 00:33:24,375
So those were two categories.

345
00:33:24,475 --> 00:33:27,317
I don't know if the students want to add anything to that.

346
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:51,028
Oh, about like the clubs and like, like the stuff we want to like add to like the website, I guess like, we just want like the clubs to be more like relevant on the website, like how I'm like a couple clubs, like the meetings usually get like, flipped, like usually get like a random day, and they don't like announce it, or whatever.

347
00:33:51,148 --> 00:33:56,710
So we kind of like want it, like the website to be a bit more like club focused, where like we there's more information.

348
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:02,971
Um, also, I don't remember this was mentioned, but maybe more like mental health resources on the website to like help students.

349
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:06,710
Thank you, Rachel.

350
00:34:06,952 --> 00:34:07,578
Thank you, Rachel.

351
00:34:10,752 --> 00:34:15,374
And in terms, and I would love to hear more about what students are looking for.

352
00:34:15,394 --> 00:34:21,715
I think that it has potential to really provide information and resources to students.

353
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:28,397
I think that, and that's an area that I think we're a little bit weak on right now, and that there's a lot of potential for growth.

354
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:32,178
And really we're open to suggestions.

355
00:34:32,558 --> 00:34:37,500
This website is for the community, all aspects of the community, whether it's students, family,

356
00:34:40,259 --> 00:34:40,639
staff.

357
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,261
So we're very open to suggestions.

358
00:34:44,442 --> 00:34:47,543
And then, just a little more.

359
00:34:49,164 --> 00:34:55,368
Just to make sure that everybody knows that a piece of all of this is that there is a mobile app that is available right now.

360
00:34:57,543 --> 00:35:02,069
I took this screenshot you can see the top event is on the news is today's meeting.

361
00:35:04,212 --> 00:35:05,775
So the mobile app is available.

362
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:12,925
It does show calendar events, news, it has access to the lunch menu school brains.

363
00:35:14,935 --> 00:35:20,919
I want to make sure that we kind of keep the knowledge that this is a piece of the website.

364
00:35:20,959 --> 00:35:22,901
It draws directly from the website.

365
00:35:23,001 --> 00:35:27,364
There's nothing additional that we do to maintain the mobile app.

366
00:35:27,444 --> 00:35:31,707
It pulls directly all of the information from the website.

367
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:37,512
So if we add a post to the website, it automatically becomes available on the mobile app.

368
00:35:38,652 --> 00:35:42,934
It is there, it is in the Play Store and the Apple App Store.

369
00:35:43,814 --> 00:35:53,538
There is one issue with on some phones with being able to select the high school as the location you would like to filter on because we have such a long name.

370
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:59,800
It is doable, but it's a little bit, I don't know, it needs to be improved.

371
00:36:01,961 --> 00:36:07,243
But we haven't, you know, I think that there's been some information that's gone out about the mobile app, but it hasn't really been

372
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,480
pushed a lot.

373
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:16,863
It's definitely been included in the superintendent's memo, if I remember correctly, but I just wanted to make sure that that was not forgotten.

374
00:36:17,543 --> 00:36:24,585
And then the last slide I have, the last two are really just thank yous, and I just wanted to thank the school committee of the administration.

375
00:36:25,085 --> 00:36:32,387
Diane Caldwell is not here today, but she's been really taking the lead on so many aspects of the website development.

376
00:36:32,687 --> 00:36:34,728
Molly Leighton, director of technology, Thomas,

377
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:43,210
who's here, and then the posting teams, and the student website team, and just everybody.

378
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,070
It's been a team effort.

379
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:52,211
There's been a lot of people involved that have helped to bring the website to where it is now, and we'll continue to make it better as we go forward.

380
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:53,932
So that's it.

381
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:54,912
Thank you.

382
00:36:56,312 --> 00:36:56,692
Thank you.

383
00:36:56,872 --> 00:36:58,193
Member McLaughlin, did you have a question?

384
00:37:00,853 --> 00:37:01,093
Yeah.

385
00:37:01,173 --> 00:37:02,434
What is the name of the mobile app?

386
00:37:02,494 --> 00:37:03,734
Is it just Medford Public Schools?

387
00:37:04,194 --> 00:37:04,354
Yes.

388
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:05,914
Thank you.

389
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:18,181
Um, so I think we, when we brought this to the school committee, we definitely, um, were interested in exploring a little bit more about phase two.

390
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:22,623
And so I, um, and there were a couple of things that.

391
00:37:23,804 --> 00:37:26,905
Um, sort of piqued my interest as you were talking.

392
00:37:27,405 --> 00:37:38,070
Um, and, and that I've heard about, um, and actually I invited, uh, miss Perry today as well, because I think we couple of things that we've heard at the school committee over.

393
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:57,161
the course of this last year is that some of the athletic teams are like, they're sort of like out there on their own for a whole variety of reasons, sort of managing their own websites where they're like sort of posting all of their community right like their

394
00:37:57,941 --> 00:38:02,983
Their track results their information for teams, etc.

395
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:13,648
One of the parents on the track team brought that to my attention that the track coach was like sort of maintaining this website on his own at his own expense and I, I certainly don't think that we.

396
00:38:14,048 --> 00:38:23,312
sort of asked him to do that, but I imagine that he did it at a time when our website was really not very functional and he wanted a way to sort of provide all of that.

397
00:38:23,432 --> 00:38:30,814
And so that to me was one of the reasons why I invited Miss Perry is because I think all of the athletic teams and to

398
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:56,579
to Rachel's point earlier, our extracurriculars all have potentially the same sort of use case and need to be able to have a space that can sort of live underneath the auspices of our overall website and be nimble and easy enough for people to post, but still informative.

399
00:38:56,639 --> 00:38:59,340
So that we don't have, and one thing that does concern me from a

400
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:14,190
sort of security perspective is like we don't have people out on all kinds of websites all over the place posting information that may or may not conform to sort of the guidelines that we would use to manage our own internal website.

401
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:19,434
So one question I think I had for this group from a phase two perspective is

402
00:39:20,194 --> 00:39:35,070
Like, is there an opportunity to take that as a body of work around athletics and the extracurriculars and figure out really a process by which those pages can exist and can exist.

403
00:39:36,823 --> 00:39:39,885
with the right like parameters and controls in place.

404
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:41,406
And I wanted Ms.

405
00:39:41,426 --> 00:39:46,249
Perry to be here for sure because obviously there are some tentacles there with athletics.

406
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:56,756
So I would just be interested in any thoughts that the team has around whether that is something that's viable for us to be thinking about as part of a phase two.

407
00:39:58,037 --> 00:40:00,018
Sure, I can speak to the athletic piece.

408
00:40:00,118 --> 00:40:06,362
So we have what we call our school today and our scheduling, our registration site,

409
00:40:06,789 --> 00:40:13,233
We have team pages where I post all of our scores, all of the rosters are there.

410
00:40:13,273 --> 00:40:21,538
So all of that information is housed there and it is linked from our final site to our athletics pages.

411
00:40:21,778 --> 00:40:29,703
The only thing we really don't have is a specific page where we have news from our athletic activities, for example,

412
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:40,041
maybe doing a highlight of, thank you for bringing that up, maybe doing a highlight of certain games or doing a highlight of coaches or a highlight of students or captains.

413
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:45,402
So maybe having a specific athletic news page where we can kind of do some of those things.

414
00:40:46,563 --> 00:40:57,605
But I think for at least the scheduling piece, the rosters, the scores, all of that stuff is kind of housed in that our school where that is also linked on that side.

415
00:40:58,066 --> 00:40:59,987
Yep, that's the schedule that you see there.

416
00:41:00,647 --> 00:41:02,488
Um, and those are all links.

417
00:41:02,508 --> 00:41:14,433
So when we have registration open, for example, winter registration, we open in a couple of weeks, we have students that register for hockey that signals our activity schedule.

418
00:41:14,453 --> 00:41:16,414
Let us say, okay, kids are scheduled for hockey.

419
00:41:16,454 --> 00:41:17,875
Let's post that hockey schedule.

420
00:41:17,895 --> 00:41:19,596
So it's all kind of intertwined.

421
00:41:20,056 --> 00:41:27,039
And when I do rosters, I pulled from the registration site, the kids that registered for hockey, I pull that over to the hockey roster.

422
00:41:27,503 --> 00:41:30,104
And then that all gets pushed over to our facility scheduler.

423
00:41:30,484 --> 00:41:37,486
So like I said, it's kind of a big web there, but for our need, I would definitely say getting that news out.

424
00:41:37,666 --> 00:41:43,487
I do ads on Twitter every week about our upcoming games.

425
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:45,188
We have pictures of our students.

426
00:41:45,948 --> 00:41:47,028
Thank you for bringing that up.

427
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:52,690
That was actually the crew team just had a meet on Sunday.

428
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,251
So that was their information, but I try to do, or I do every week,

429
00:41:56,907 --> 00:41:58,708
you can see boys, freshmen soccer there.

430
00:41:59,088 --> 00:42:01,989
We do ads and we push that out to Twitter.

431
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:06,531
I also send it to coaches so they can push it out to Facebook and so forth.

432
00:42:06,851 --> 00:42:08,992
But that's what I have for my end.

433
00:42:10,543 --> 00:42:11,244
Thank you, Rachel.

434
00:42:11,264 --> 00:42:27,456
I guess one of the things that I don't know a lot about from a final site perspective is whether there are integrations available that would make some of these connections easier so that everybody can sort of work in the native place that they work.

435
00:42:28,156 --> 00:42:33,981
And it doesn't have to be like so labor intensive to sort of move information to final sites.

436
00:42:34,021 --> 00:42:37,984
So in other words, like this final site have some sort of integration that would work with

437
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:58,529
Is it our school where all of the athletics work is happening and then can, is there some like more integrated way on the back end for the website to organically take the information that is being populated and managed in our school or whatever it's called?

438
00:42:58,931 --> 00:42:59,972
on the athletic side.

439
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:05,075
So I didn't know what kind of integrations were available with final site that we should be thinking about taking advantage of.

440
00:43:05,435 --> 00:43:15,300
And those always are like sort of meaty projects that would definitely to your point of like internships and things like that, those sort of lend themselves to that kind of thinking a little bit more.

441
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:20,023
And I will say that final site does provide an athletics module.

442
00:43:20,083 --> 00:43:20,543
They do

443
00:43:22,583 --> 00:43:34,296
say that they have integration I'm not sure when we look it looked like maybe they were almost there but not quite there so it might be something where in the future that integration might be a little bit cleaner.

444
00:43:35,217 --> 00:43:42,786
I think it's something we need to stay abreast of and keep an eye on what final site is offering it is an additional fee.

445
00:43:45,151 --> 00:43:49,573
I forget what it was, but it wasn't, it was like $5,000 a year or something for the integration.

446
00:43:50,574 --> 00:43:54,976
Um, I'm not sure but it was in that range, plus or minus some amount.

447
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:13,197
So it is something that we've looked at a little bit, but looking at, after talking with Rachel and trying to understand more about the complexity of scheduling, rosters, facility management, all of that, Rachel can say more about that.

448
00:44:13,497 --> 00:44:21,181
It became clear that the current tool, you know, what final site was currently offering wasn't quite there, but we are optimistic that

449
00:44:21,954 --> 00:44:35,611
I think that that could be a future thing but we're also looking at ways of like, like the page that we're looking at right now where we are able to Rachel updates, the Twitter feed or X feed or whatever it's called.

450
00:44:36,352 --> 00:44:39,636
And then we're able to embed that on the website.

451
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:46,191
We've been looking at ways of, you know, highlighting, promoting home games.

452
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:53,716
I like Rachel's idea about highlighting, you know, teams or coaches or players.

453
00:44:55,056 --> 00:45:01,540
So kind of, I think the idea of maybe an athletics specific news might be a nice idea.

454
00:45:03,721 --> 00:45:09,704
So I think that there are definitely things we can do and hopefully eventually we could move toward that more integrated,

455
00:45:12,315 --> 00:45:15,637
kind of module using the module that final site provides.

456
00:45:15,837 --> 00:45:21,900
I'm not sure if Rachel has anything to add to that, but that's sort of kind of where I feel like we landed when we've had this conversation.

457
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:25,602
Yes, I agree.

458
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:30,244
I think there was a couple of things that wouldn't really be transferred over.

459
00:45:30,284 --> 00:45:35,347
So we were kind of waiting to see what would happen if they could, you know, do that in the future.

460
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:36,667
But I totally agree.

461
00:45:36,707 --> 00:45:39,749
I think maybe, you know, wait to see what happens with them and then

462
00:45:40,325 --> 00:45:42,326
if it can be integrated, then we do that.

463
00:45:43,706 --> 00:45:55,411
I think what was happening too, with our school today, you can actually load all of the schedules onto a Google calendar, right?

464
00:45:55,491 --> 00:45:57,652
So I think that's, but we couldn't go the other way.

465
00:45:57,712 --> 00:45:59,013
So I think that was a glitch too.

466
00:46:00,053 --> 00:46:01,794
Right, Lisa, if I remember.

467
00:46:02,174 --> 00:46:03,755
Yeah, that sounds familiar, yes.

468
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:05,776
I'm not a hundred percent, but that sounds right.

469
00:46:08,137 --> 00:46:22,975
Got it so and maybe the the right sort of implementation approach is to start with the some of the clubs and activities that don't really have a presence right now and work out sort of how that.

470
00:46:23,936 --> 00:46:41,174
can work, whether it's like student students to have access to post on behalf of their clubs or that's something the advisors do, but I would imagine like as you do that there's some like rules of the road that come out right in terms of how to make it as effective as possible and then.

471
00:46:41,815 --> 00:46:57,676
Maybe like the next phase could ultimately be like when this integration is available from an athletics perspective we sort of bring the rest of the athletics teams along that same pathway that we've worked out with, with the extracurriculars, and I will say that final site.

472
00:46:59,793 --> 00:47:12,221
has really a lot of different levels of permissions and we like let's say we did say okay students for different clubs could post on a club's board or something, you know.

473
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:22,449
It's really easy to set up where they wouldn't have access to anything other than just that one, you know, board that they could post to.

474
00:47:23,570 --> 00:47:34,255
So that we don't open ourselves up to a larger number of people potentially having access to other areas of the website that we just, you know, for security reasons, we don't want everybody to have access to.

475
00:47:41,184 --> 00:47:42,587
Oh, sorry.

476
00:47:43,388 --> 00:47:43,749
Thank you.

477
00:47:43,769 --> 00:47:46,914
Yeah, and I think to that, I think those are.

478
00:47:47,631 --> 00:47:48,831
are really great points.

479
00:47:48,931 --> 00:47:55,333
Member Graham, in terms of the phase two and thinking about the integration and also the groups that are not represented.

480
00:47:55,534 --> 00:48:09,418
And in addition to that, to Thomas's role in sort of all of this as well as sort of the uniformity and be able to create some standardization and standards of some of this.

481
00:48:09,498 --> 00:48:15,580
And so, for example, you know, we have approved and required a

482
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:21,642
non-discrimination statement for all sign-ups for any activity of the life of the school.

483
00:48:22,122 --> 00:48:37,527
So, you know, whenever there's a form that goes out to sign up for an athletic event or to get tickets for a dance or, you know, any of those things that there's a non-discrimination statement that says, you know, Medford does not discriminate on the basis of all the things that we don't discriminate on.

484
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:43,529
And if you need accommodations, here is the path to, you know, request accommodations to participate.

485
00:48:44,276 --> 00:48:47,537
And that, again, was going to be out 9-1.

486
00:48:47,737 --> 00:48:55,819
And I think that, you know, just with the start of the school year, it's been a little bit delayed, but that's coming and it should be uniform on everything that's the life of the school.

487
00:48:55,919 --> 00:49:01,180
So I would imagine, you know, maybe that's part of Thomas's role in some of this.

488
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:11,283
If not, I would like to know whose it is or whose it would be just in terms of uniformity in messaging or approval, I guess, or something.

489
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:39,784
Yeah, definitely part of my role, Member McLaughlin, and actually just circulated a memo with building principals this week reminding them that that should be included on all the appropriate web pages and most of all on flyers and sign up forms for events to affirmatively remind that we offer all reasonable accommodations to anybody who needs them for any event.

490
00:49:41,124 --> 00:49:46,947
So yeah, that's an important point and something that we're definitely on top of.

491
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:47,968
Excellent.

492
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:48,268
Thank you.

493
00:49:48,288 --> 00:49:52,490
And if that could be added to the phase two of the website as well, that would be great.

494
00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:56,432
I know I did a search on it the other day and it hadn't happened yet.

495
00:49:56,512 --> 00:50:01,335
So I know that you guys are working super hard on it and I really appreciate all the effort.

496
00:50:02,115 --> 00:50:10,240
And member Graham, I'm sure you're thinking of this, but just sort of wondering if there'll be another FCE meeting regarding phase two

497
00:50:10,936 --> 00:50:12,518
you know, the implementation of phase two.

498
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:25,733
Yeah, I mean, I think the the goal of this meeting was for us to have some discussion about the options for phase two so that we could, you know, bring that update back to the school committee for sure.

499
00:50:27,061 --> 00:50:41,957
But also, you know, understand whatever we sort of think through and give Miss Miller in the in the project team some time to think about like what it will take and to do various things and what they might need from us to be able to do those things.

500
00:50:42,718 --> 00:50:46,242
So I think there's some work on their part and then we can reconvene so

501
00:50:47,431 --> 00:51:09,317
What we might do at the end of this meeting is continue the meeting to a date in the future and then we'll sort of pick it up at a point, probably, you know, maybe even after the new year I'm not sure, depending on, you know, some information that, you know, depending on how much work there is to do to really think through those next steps.

502
00:51:12,073 --> 00:51:18,495
But two other things that sort of were on my mind as I thought about the website in general.

503
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:32,618
One was around payments, payments of all kind, and whether there's really like a sort of a, I'll say a single unified

504
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:38,598
venue for payments to Medford Public Schools?

505
00:51:39,399 --> 00:51:58,639
And I think the answer is no, or maybe not yet, but is there like a single place where you could go and you could pay for a lost library book, to add money to somebody's school lunch account, to sign up for athletics, to pay

506
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:17,370
For whatever the things are right that that money flows into our our school district from families and so you know maybe in the bigger picture I would want there not to have to be money that flows into the district from families, but in the meantime.

507
00:52:18,931 --> 00:52:29,018
Is there a single place and does final site have capabilities there that we should be exploring as part of phase two in terms of of all things payments and?

508
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:36,237
Certainly when we talk about payments, security becomes a really big part of the discussion.

509
00:52:36,257 --> 00:52:59,462
And I, you know, I will admit that I have some agita around our payment processes sort of across the district because I just don't know enough to feel like each and every one of them independently is, you know, sort of rising to the level of the kind of standards that you want to see in place when you start taking

510
00:53:00,345 --> 00:53:00,585
money.

511
00:53:01,606 --> 00:53:12,292
So I didn't know what kind of capabilities final site had, what we're using, what we're not using, what the options are, and how do we create like a single place for people to go when they have to do something like that.

512
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:17,804
Yeah, so I mean, I'll start with just kind of my first thoughts.

513
00:53:18,805 --> 00:53:24,370
So we do use BlueSnap through FinalSight to handle online payments.

514
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:31,936
And we've been using them for things like the AP exam payments, summer school, and the athletic user fees.

515
00:53:32,456 --> 00:53:40,443
Each of those has very unique information associated with the form that they need to fill out to make that payment.

516
00:53:43,257 --> 00:53:50,142
So, you know, what sport are you participating in or what AP test are you taking, that kind of thing.

517
00:53:50,823 --> 00:53:57,028
And so I think that having separate forms is how we've approached it so far.

518
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:02,992
I guess I'm trying to think how it could play out where you had a more universal one.

519
00:54:03,012 --> 00:54:07,696
I don't really, I can't envision it right now, but I might

520
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:10,570
you know, with more thought maybe something would come to mind.

521
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:24,497
I could also just see having a page on the website that was like payments, and it just had a list of all the things that we did accept payments for that you could kind of click on and not have to go say okay well wait

522
00:54:24,577 --> 00:54:27,558
Where is that AP payment?

523
00:54:27,618 --> 00:54:30,920
It's down over in student services and testing and AP.

524
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:33,141
And maybe somebody is having a hard time finding it.

525
00:54:33,161 --> 00:54:43,966
So if there was like one universal place that all payments were listed, something like that might be an easy step, step one step.

526
00:54:46,087 --> 00:54:46,788
So I don't know.

527
00:54:46,868 --> 00:54:48,628
Those are the first thoughts that come to my mind.

528
00:54:48,668 --> 00:54:50,289
I see Thomas raised his hand too.

529
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:51,710
Thomas?

530
00:54:52,478 --> 00:54:53,959
Yeah, thank you.

531
00:54:54,219 --> 00:55:00,564
Something along those lines is employed on a lot of municipal websites.

532
00:55:01,705 --> 00:55:02,665
I live in Malden.

533
00:55:02,965 --> 00:55:12,232
And in Malden, you can go to cityofmalden.org slash billpay, which is a link I'll share in the chat also.

534
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:18,536
But it does basically just list out all the different kinds of bills that the city might send you and get you

535
00:55:19,837 --> 00:55:25,900
In the case of Malden, they use a third-party bill service.

536
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:30,682
But there are options like that, like Ms.

537
00:55:30,722 --> 00:55:38,125
Miller said, to just set up a page that lists out all the different things that you might pay for and link out to all those different forms.

538
00:55:38,245 --> 00:55:42,407
Because as the presentation showed, there is a really

539
00:55:42,967 --> 00:55:50,391
complete form for athletic sign up that lists all the different sports for each season and which ones you're paying the fees for.

540
00:55:50,411 --> 00:55:57,995
There's a good list of the AP exam options and all the different things you might sign up for.

541
00:55:58,075 --> 00:56:03,378
So it might just be a matter of setting up a kind of landing page to link out to this stuff.

542
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:11,560
Yeah, I think that could sort of get us a good portion of the way there, honestly.

543
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:32,507
So I don't necessarily think it needs to be like, when I'm thinking about one-stop shopping, I think the thing that I'm thinking about the most is like the security required to safely sort of take online payments that we don't wanna be managing like many modules of,

544
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:35,831
um, software that's taking in payments.

545
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:48,779
So for, if everything is able to sort of coalesce around blue snap, then we know, and your team can make sure that like, we properly like worked with somebody who's a security expert around payments that we feel like.

546
00:56:49,379 --> 00:56:54,662
Good that they have all of the controls in place from a blue snap perspective, and then everything is flowing through there.

547
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,844
And so that makes sort of life simple.

548
00:56:57,864 --> 00:56:59,405
And if there's a simple landing page for

549
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:03,453
for parents like coming in and saying, how do I pay this thing?

550
00:57:03,473 --> 00:57:09,539
It could be just as simple as like those two pieces sort of linking together.

551
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:19,107
And I think that would be like a great next step in terms of like providing some accessibility.

552
00:57:19,147 --> 00:57:26,874
And I don't know if there are other things that are like operating outside of BlueSnap, but certainly like trying to like pull them all

553
00:57:27,273 --> 00:57:28,114
into one place.

554
00:57:29,035 --> 00:57:46,489
Certainly you can pull them all into one place pretty easily, but also like on that back end from a like cash management perspective and our CFO would probably, you know, need to weigh in here, but how do we create like financial controls over the money that flows through whatever these tools are as well?

555
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,692
So that would be like, that's one of the things on my mind.

556
00:57:50,233 --> 00:57:50,413
Ms.

557
00:57:50,433 --> 00:57:51,674
Perry, did you have your hand in the air?

558
00:57:52,662 --> 00:58:00,170
Yes, so quick question for our pool right now for membership to the pool we are taking check or money order.

559
00:58:00,714 --> 00:58:03,536
It would be great if we could do something online.

560
00:58:04,277 --> 00:58:10,801
My only issue is, or thought would be, there's a lot of different memberships.

561
00:58:10,881 --> 00:58:13,243
So if you're a Medford resident under 58, it's $120.

562
00:58:13,283 --> 00:58:14,424
Seniors over 58, it's $50 for six months.

563
00:58:14,444 --> 00:58:16,706
If you are not a Medford resident, it's $150.

564
00:58:16,746 --> 00:58:18,647
Is there a way through this website that

565
00:58:27,975 --> 00:58:33,620
we could allow people to sign up for memberships, but they would have to prove their age, like show a license or something like that.

566
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,921
Does that have that capability?

567
00:58:36,683 --> 00:58:42,068
Not to my knowledge currently, but I have not fully investigated that either.

568
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:47,993
So again, that's something I can put on my list of things to do is like a verification.

569
00:58:49,175 --> 00:58:52,598
I do know that for something like,

570
00:58:53,979 --> 00:59:10,368
The AP exam, we do have a little checkbox, like a little radio button, and they can say if they currently receive free or reduced price lunches, then if they click that button, the prices change on the page.

571
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:13,970
So that's the honor system.

572
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:18,693
And I think that there's some checking by the guidance department on that.

573
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,322
That verification, I am not aware of.

574
00:59:24,642 --> 00:59:26,102
This is sort of self-reporting.

575
00:59:26,122 --> 00:59:28,504
I'm just kind of bringing this up as I'm talking.

576
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:30,885
But again, I can look into that.

577
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:32,966
That would be something that I could investigate.

578
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:33,906
Thank you.

579
00:59:33,966 --> 00:59:35,167
I can take a check now.

580
00:59:35,247 --> 00:59:36,908
I can see the address, so I know where they live.

581
00:59:37,408 --> 00:59:37,828
Yeah.

582
00:59:38,509 --> 00:59:38,669
Right.

583
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:45,778
Well, and I think you know this could be sort of a great meaty little project for.

584
00:59:47,718 --> 00:59:55,961
For students to sort of sink their teeth into because it's it's a little bit it's bigger than just the web development piece of it, but it's really about how you make.

585
00:59:56,641 --> 00:59:57,943
websites useful, right?

586
00:59:58,023 --> 01:00:06,432
So you would make so many people happy if they could pay for their pool registration online.

587
01:00:07,753 --> 01:00:17,644
But to your point, if we have to have a way to have these checks and balances, what can be done to create something

588
01:00:18,775 --> 01:00:25,581
sort of manageable and approachable that allows that to happen too, I think is, you know, a really great question.

589
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:26,342
Yeah.

590
01:00:27,283 --> 01:00:31,046
So just what I have displayed right now, just so you can kind of see what I'm talking about.

591
01:00:31,066 --> 01:00:33,268
This is for the AP exam payment.

592
01:00:33,628 --> 01:00:37,712
There's a little radio button here that says if they do receive free or reduced.

593
01:00:38,392 --> 01:00:42,755
If they say yes, all the prices after the exams update to be $15.

594
01:00:44,075 --> 01:00:58,023
And that's kind of how BlueSnap works with the forms is whatever payment is associated with what they check, that becomes, you know, they can add them up if they're doing three exams, it adds it all up and then leads to a payment page after that.

595
01:00:59,103 --> 01:01:01,445
So that's the example.

596
01:01:03,006 --> 01:01:03,666
Member McLaughlin?

597
01:01:05,643 --> 01:01:06,504
Thank you.

598
01:01:06,944 --> 01:01:23,356
Yeah, and I just wanted to get back to the language accessibility issue or issues that we were talking about in the beginning, particularly regarding, you know, outreach and thinking about that I just want to put a bug in folks here about the cultural brokers and using, you know,

599
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:38,626
City side, I'm assuming, you know, maybe I shouldn't assume, but I would think the mayor would welcome the opportunity to work with the cultural brokers to really help them get the word out about.

600
01:01:39,298 --> 01:01:47,442
the website, and then also I think there's an opportunity to look at the interpretation line.

601
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:53,364
I don't think that the school has an interpretation line, but I know the city side does.

602
01:01:53,844 --> 01:02:00,067
Is the school, do you know, Dr. Edward Vincent, is the school accessing the interpretation line?

603
01:02:02,259 --> 01:02:17,936
When interpretation is required for meetings, we work with Paul Teixeira, our director of EL, so we do have interpreters available for specialized meetings that do take place.

604
01:02:18,417 --> 01:02:20,960
I want to say with Bay State interpreters,

605
01:02:22,921 --> 01:02:38,912
But I'm talking more about like if you know if a if a teacher needs to call, or if a family wants a teacher to call them and I know that they have talking points but perhaps or school committee member to call them and their, you know, their family is.

606
01:02:39,571 --> 01:02:44,337
you know, primary languages, again, say Portuguese or Haitian Creole or something.

607
01:02:45,979 --> 01:02:50,344
Does the school have access to the city interpretation line?

608
01:02:50,404 --> 01:02:54,089
So, you know, we have an interpretation line at my office.

609
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:55,511
It's a great tool.

610
01:02:56,107 --> 01:03:05,573
you know, we're able to call a third party who then, you know, creates a party line, you know, gets the third person on the phone and then interprets between the two languages.

611
01:03:05,653 --> 01:03:11,437
And it's been really fabulous in terms of relationship building and really being able to reach families.

612
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:17,720
So it sounds like we don't know the answer to that question, but- We do have interpreters, member Graham.

613
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:21,203
We have Mr. Bonbon who is- No, no.

614
01:03:22,695 --> 01:03:24,156
Sorry, go ahead, Member Graham.

615
01:03:24,616 --> 01:03:33,522
So I just want to be mindful of the fact that we are sort of under the requirement of the open meeting law, and we really shouldn't be talking about things that aren't officially posted.

616
01:03:33,642 --> 01:03:36,764
So I think this is a great conversation.

617
01:03:37,705 --> 01:03:42,588
But if there's a question about the website, I think we should continue to answer that question.

618
01:03:42,628 --> 01:03:46,350
But I think your question is a little bit different than about the website.

619
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,491
Am I right, Member McLaughlin?

620
01:03:48,334 --> 01:04:06,777
No, actually, thank you for asking though it's about having the language line on the website so, but I can investigate further in terms of access and to the superintendent's point I understand we have interpreters superintendent for outreach, you know, for specific meetings or what have you.

621
01:04:07,618 --> 01:04:16,162
we don't necessarily have those for, you know, individual phone calls or outreach from school committee members or sort of those things that a language line provides.

622
01:04:16,462 --> 01:04:30,369
So my question is, does, I would assume the language line is a citywide access language line, in which case that means that the school can access it, in which case that would mean that it can be shared on our website.

623
01:04:30,789 --> 01:04:32,770
But I would like to confirm that.

624
01:04:33,362 --> 01:04:39,910
Yeah, and I don't think you can assume that because it's a city resource that the schools have access to it.

625
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:50,543
There's some particular laws, regulations, rules, whatever, about sharing of resources and how those things actually come to pass.

626
01:04:50,583 --> 01:04:50,984
So I think

627
01:04:51,946 --> 01:04:54,448
checking in on that first makes sense.

628
01:04:54,568 --> 01:05:04,494
And then if there are phone numbers that can be used to sort of access this, making those numbers available on the website makes perfect sense.

629
01:05:04,534 --> 01:05:11,638
But I think that needs to be sort of vetted before we can make the ask that it goes on to the website.

630
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:13,760
Agreed.

631
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:14,600
Thank you very much.

632
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:15,661
That's exactly the point.

633
01:05:15,781 --> 01:05:16,201
Thank you.

634
01:05:17,302 --> 01:05:17,482
Great.

635
01:05:21,266 --> 01:05:40,561
And then I think the other, so two other comments that I had sort of on my agenda, I was in, we were, parents were invited to something that the guidance office was doing, like Coffee with the Guidance Counselor or something like that.

636
01:05:42,142 --> 01:05:42,322
And,

637
01:05:45,445 --> 01:05:56,389
In the context of that invitation, there was another website listed that was like medmhsguidance.com.

638
01:05:56,849 --> 01:05:58,070
Hold on, let me get the exact website.

639
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:58,690
Cause I wrote it down.

640
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:02,091
I was like, I have to remember to bring this medfordhighguidance.com.

641
01:06:03,492 --> 01:06:06,853
And so I think my question would be is like another phase two.

642
01:06:08,872 --> 01:06:13,418
sunsetting the independent guidance website, whatever it might be.

643
01:06:13,438 --> 01:06:25,693
I don't know, I haven't been there, but I would imagine that we would want the good work being done in our guidance department to be front and center as part of our website.

644
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:28,975
I'm actually surprised that that link is still there.

645
01:06:30,316 --> 01:06:33,758
That is an old link that site doesn't exist any longer.

646
01:06:33,898 --> 01:06:38,721
And we have moved all of the content over to the final site website.

647
01:06:39,402 --> 01:06:40,422
Oh, that's great news.

648
01:06:40,683 --> 01:06:40,903
Okay.

649
01:06:40,923 --> 01:06:50,049
Perfect, because I saw that I was like, how, how do we keep finding websites that are sort of like out in the ether here, but it is hard to sort of unwind them.

650
01:06:50,149 --> 01:06:50,309
So

651
01:06:50,609 --> 01:06:58,271
So maybe more likely that it was just an artifact that got moved over from an older version of an invite accidentally.

652
01:06:58,911 --> 01:06:59,611
Yeah.

653
01:06:59,631 --> 01:07:01,732
Yeah.

654
01:07:01,812 --> 01:07:01,972
It is.

655
01:07:03,613 --> 01:07:03,933
Perfect.

656
01:07:05,033 --> 01:07:19,417
So to the point of some of the discussion we've had so far, I think the other next step that would be really great is something that officially describes for the public what's

657
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:26,842
what's on the website, what it's all about, that the website is available in five languages.

658
01:07:26,862 --> 01:07:27,022
I think

659
01:07:28,479 --> 01:07:30,940
people would be so delighted to hear that.

660
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:47,730
And I don't think we've done a great job of describing all this good work outside of school committee meetings, of course, but I also am acutely aware that school committee meetings are attended by a very, very, very tiny fraction of the population.

661
01:07:48,210 --> 01:07:54,934
And we have, you know, 4,000 odd students that come through our doors every single day.

662
01:07:57,442 --> 01:08:07,309
how can we sort of push out a more formal communication about what's on the website, what's available, how to access it, that the app exists, like how they work together, et cetera.

663
01:08:07,349 --> 01:08:13,094
So I think a lot of really good work has been done that we need to promote.

664
01:08:15,676 --> 01:08:22,461
So I think that's like another sort of maybe next step or phase two type of item.

665
01:08:23,889 --> 01:08:24,249
And then.

666
01:08:25,130 --> 01:08:34,814
Sort of the last thing on my mind is really around some of the information that gets posted and shared about our school committee meetings.

667
01:08:35,054 --> 01:08:37,375
So one of the things that we did.

668
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:50,600
As we set our as we passed our first school committee set of goals, I think maybe ever in the history of Medford was talk about a desire to translate our.

669
01:08:53,058 --> 01:09:04,710
our agendas into multiple languages so that they are more accessible to our families than a simple English posting would be.

670
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:10,235
And I happened to notice, Dr. Edward Vincent, that the last handful of agendas did include links

671
01:09:11,539 --> 01:09:15,121
if I'm remembering correctly, that were translated, but.

672
01:09:15,141 --> 01:09:16,501
Yes, you are accurate.

673
01:09:16,601 --> 01:09:23,545
For the regular meetings, we, in September, that was like the deadline that we were given.

674
01:09:23,685 --> 01:09:33,129
So we started translating all of the regular meeting agendas with the hyperlinks in the header.

675
01:09:33,589 --> 01:09:39,652
So that just similar to the way the Friday communications go out, the translations are also available.

676
01:09:40,959 --> 01:09:45,165
And I that's great news, I was so excited to see that.

677
01:09:47,107 --> 01:09:54,578
I did wonder, though, it looks like somebody is like essentially having to hand translate them much like they do with your.

678
01:09:56,249 --> 01:10:01,210
your weekly memos, and I'm not sure if that's true, but it looked so similar in structure to me.

679
01:10:01,950 --> 01:10:13,312
And I just wondered if there was a better way to make use of the website if we were to post our agendas a little bit differently than we do, so that they're not PDFs, because PDFs can't be translated.

680
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:22,434
But if there was a different way for us to post school committee materials to the website, would that inherently sort of avail us of

681
01:10:23,254 --> 01:10:30,517
the translation services that are available through final site and make the process of all of this translation a little bit easier.

682
01:10:32,058 --> 01:10:34,579
That would be, I think that's a great suggestion.

683
01:10:34,619 --> 01:10:45,343
I would have to defer to Lisa or Thomas like to say if we get the content possibly in a different way, would that be possible?

684
01:10:46,704 --> 01:10:47,845
Thomas, you had your hand in the air.

685
01:10:47,885 --> 01:10:48,705
Did you want to?

686
01:10:48,885 --> 01:10:49,685
Yeah, yeah.

687
01:10:50,326 --> 01:10:52,366
You were reading my mind, Member Graham.

688
01:10:52,747 --> 01:10:53,487
I think.

689
01:10:53,507 --> 01:10:56,788
I'm doing it soon, but also checking Janice.

690
01:10:57,169 --> 01:10:58,829
So at five minutes.

691
01:10:59,870 --> 01:11:00,650
Oops, can we?

692
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:01,430
Got it.

693
01:11:02,151 --> 01:11:02,431
Thank you.

694
01:11:03,018 --> 01:11:19,373
Yeah, I think you're exactly right, that if we just move away from linking to a PDF and instead include the text of the agenda in a news post, the existing translation and accessibility tools on the website would automatically be

695
01:11:20,313 --> 01:11:21,254
covering what we're doing there.

696
01:11:21,274 --> 01:11:26,458
And we've moved in a similar direction on the superintendent's memo.

697
01:11:26,498 --> 01:11:43,070
The main reason we still include the Google Doc translation in the superintendent's memo is because we often share the Google link when we send out the text message version of the memo in the weekly updates.

698
01:11:43,150 --> 01:11:45,932
But yeah, if something's on the website,

699
01:11:46,713 --> 01:11:51,417
we don't need to separately translate it because the built-in translation plugin handles it.

700
01:11:52,017 --> 01:11:52,217
Right.

701
01:11:52,898 --> 01:11:59,302
And so I think, you know, that I think would be a great other sort of next step.

702
01:11:59,342 --> 01:12:10,090
I know we gave you like 25 next steps in phase two, so you can you can sort of put all those in a hat and shake up the hat and figure out like what makes the most sense from a implementation perspective.

703
01:12:10,110 --> 01:12:13,293
And, you know, Carolyn and Rachel and

704
01:12:15,094 --> 01:12:28,551
Tenzine and the other folks that are on the team certainly probably have a lot to say about the work that's required and the work that they are going to undertake.

705
01:12:28,651 --> 01:12:32,816
So I would certainly want to defer to you all to think about all the things that we've talked about.

706
01:12:34,877 --> 01:12:50,707
I think this like school committee, this idea about using the website as sort of a way to power some of the objectives the school committee has around accessibility and translation, if we can get that right with the agendas, could we get that right with the minutes?

707
01:12:50,967 --> 01:12:53,748
And could we get that right with some of the other materials?

708
01:12:54,049 --> 01:13:00,153
And so I don't wanna like, I don't wanna boil the ocean necessarily like right out of the gate, because I think that is where

709
01:13:01,093 --> 01:13:15,403
good projects sort of fall apart, but if we could start and try with the agendas and get a process that works, is there a next thing and a next thing and a next thing that could build there?

710
01:13:16,384 --> 01:13:16,764
Thomas?

711
01:13:18,365 --> 01:13:19,205
Yeah, definitely.

712
01:13:19,225 --> 01:13:20,947
I think

713
01:13:22,341 --> 01:13:24,543
that's exactly the direction we should be headed.

714
01:13:25,504 --> 01:13:30,790
Because what I love about working with our website is that we own everything that's on our website.

715
01:13:31,170 --> 01:13:33,933
The downside is that

716
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:59,292
If Mark Zuckerberg pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on Facebook, if Elon Musk pulls a plug on

717
01:13:59,492 --> 01:14:05,093
That's per the open meeting law that we publish all of the minutes online after the committee approves them.

718
01:14:05,293 --> 01:14:12,735
And like the agendas, yeah, maybe there's scope for posting them in a different format.

719
01:14:12,755 --> 01:14:14,975
So they're PDFs currently.

720
01:14:15,815 --> 01:14:23,217
And so maybe that's something we look at changing so that they're updated by the website.

721
01:14:26,137 --> 01:14:26,778
Member Graham?

722
01:14:28,498 --> 01:14:29,118
Member McLaughlin?

723
01:14:30,623 --> 01:14:30,863
Yeah.

724
01:14:30,963 --> 01:14:32,724
And to that point, I think that's great.

725
01:14:32,804 --> 01:14:46,709
And I think these are, and again, you know, you know, not putting too much out there on folks all at once, but I think that, you know, these are great, but if we don't get the marketing and outreach out to the folks who need it to know that it exists, right.

726
01:14:47,069 --> 01:14:52,831
I mean, first things first, I'm so glad that we're even, you know, doing this and, and, and, you know, I'm thinking of it.

727
01:14:53,851 --> 01:14:59,533
And I want to make sure that we're really thinking about how we're getting the information out so that people know that it actually

728
01:15:00,382 --> 01:15:01,782
exist, so thank you.

729
01:15:03,463 --> 01:15:04,443
Great.

730
01:15:04,563 --> 01:15:04,903
Eunice.

731
01:15:07,204 --> 01:15:08,324
Folks, welcome back.

732
01:15:10,625 --> 01:15:11,385
Quick question.

733
01:15:12,645 --> 01:15:24,948
I try on a regular basis, as I'm sure you've seen, to keep people informed as well on everybody's behalf and posting the links and so forth.

734
01:15:28,118 --> 01:15:33,799
occasionally I'll try and post, you know, the entire agenda or a part of the agenda.

735
01:15:34,919 --> 01:15:47,662
And I find when I do it with the city council, city clerk sends out his agendas in both a PDF and a word format.

736
01:15:48,342 --> 01:15:52,063
So I can either very easily just cut and paste the entire

737
01:15:53,231 --> 01:15:58,794
Word document agenda and share it out.

738
01:15:59,094 --> 01:16:06,078
Or maybe I just want to highlight a specific resolution or something that I think will be of interest to the community.

739
01:16:06,098 --> 01:16:10,740
And so it's easy to pretty much copy and paste four or five lines.

740
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,622
But when I go and do it with the school committee,

741
01:16:14,662 --> 01:16:22,046
It ends up kind of all running together and then I have to go in and adjust spacing and so forth so that it's readable.

742
01:16:22,066 --> 01:16:30,930
I don't know if that's because it's PDF or what, but I'm just curious why that is.

743
01:16:31,290 --> 01:16:42,936
And for anybody who wants to maybe highlight a part of the agenda or even the whole thing, as opposed to just copying a link,

744
01:16:44,013 --> 01:16:45,333
there must be an easier way.

745
01:16:46,314 --> 01:16:47,774
I don't know if any of that made sense.

746
01:16:47,854 --> 01:16:52,895
And I apologize if I'm putting it in a spot in the discussion where it doesn't belong.

747
01:16:53,476 --> 01:16:53,856
No, no.

748
01:16:53,956 --> 01:16:57,637
I think that's actually a great point, Eunice.

749
01:16:58,917 --> 01:17:10,120
Because what we don't, we follow all of the rules that sort of keep us in compliance.

750
01:17:11,091 --> 01:17:20,973
and make us consistent with the open meeting law and the posting requirements of the city, which are we're actually still a physical posting city, which is a whole other topic.

751
01:17:22,053 --> 01:17:30,595
But when it comes to like making people aware of what's on the school committee agenda, that's a different matter entirely.

752
01:17:30,615 --> 01:17:34,935
And I don't think we do a great job at that today.

753
01:17:36,876 --> 01:17:38,396
And so people like yourself,

754
01:17:39,096 --> 01:17:45,181
You know me if I if there's something on the agenda that people you know it happens sort of organically which isn't a problem.

755
01:17:46,002 --> 01:17:54,409
But if there was a posting on our website that we could sort of point to link to on a regular basis.

756
01:17:55,109 --> 01:18:03,973
Then it becomes easier to sort of put that posting in a whole variety of places on our website, you know, in various local pages and whatever.

757
01:18:03,993 --> 01:18:16,799
And then it becomes easier to link to from like the superintendents Friday memo and and all the other places we're communicating from so that people have people have a better chance of accessing that information than they do today.

758
01:18:18,059 --> 01:18:34,287
I think the other thing you sort of highlighted, which is not necessarily like a website thing but it's certainly a communication thing is that there is some sort of service happening by the city clerk who is, you know,

759
01:18:35,566 --> 01:18:40,592
in all transparency, paid for a specific job that he's doing.

760
01:18:41,713 --> 01:18:47,019
And this is part of his job responsibilities, is to get the word out about the council meetings.

761
01:18:47,059 --> 01:18:50,142
He sort of works on behalf of the council exclusively.

762
01:18:51,464 --> 01:18:57,090
But he has, over time, I believe, created a mail list of sorts of people who wanted

763
01:18:57,510 --> 01:18:58,951
get those things in their email box.

764
01:18:58,991 --> 01:19:03,193
And it's not the everybody, but the people who say, hey, can you put me on your list?

765
01:19:03,233 --> 01:19:05,194
And then it goes out on a weekly basis.

766
01:19:05,754 --> 01:19:07,835
We don't have something like that.

767
01:19:08,495 --> 01:19:12,077
Yeah, we don't have something like that yet in Medford public schools.

768
01:19:12,697 --> 01:19:21,021
But I think that's another question probably for Tom to think about in terms of communication and like,

769
01:19:22,003 --> 01:19:28,908
how do you start to manage like essentially like sub interest subscriptions, right?

770
01:19:29,048 --> 01:19:30,529
Like that's, I think that's what we're talking about.

771
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:34,893
You know, it's different than like everybody getting the superintendent's weekly memo.

772
01:19:35,413 --> 01:19:43,739
It's like people who want that email in their email box, signing up and saying, please send this to me, you know, on whatever the interval is.

773
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,902
And so I don't know final site has some sort of like,

774
01:19:48,763 --> 01:19:52,688
connectivity that would make that easier or promote that.

775
01:19:53,009 --> 01:19:58,415
But I think that's some food for thought that might address some of the comments from Eunice.

776
01:19:58,776 --> 01:20:00,198
And Tom, I see your hands in the air.

777
01:20:01,328 --> 01:20:18,075
Yeah, thanks member Graham, you know there there are a few things, certainly where we're always interested in making sure that the meeting postings for the school committee are accessible widely, the the actual formal open meeting law posting of the meetings.

778
01:20:18,735 --> 01:20:35,454
So, although we prepare the agenda and central office and get it sent out the city clerk does actually handle the, the, the official posting on the city website, and the physical posting at City Hall which I, my understanding is that's what actually constitutes

779
01:20:36,375 --> 01:20:38,016
notice of the open meeting law.

780
01:20:39,016 --> 01:20:41,217
But we also do other things.

781
01:20:41,257 --> 01:20:48,001
We've started to work on the integration between final site and our district Facebook page.

782
01:20:49,061 --> 01:21:01,387
So if you look at the Facebook feed, you'll see that when I post a school committee agenda on the website, I'm typically pushing it to Facebook also, so that that's available to people.

783
01:21:01,807 --> 01:21:08,229
We typically have the agenda for the next week's meeting in the Friday memo from the superintendent linked.

784
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:23,492
So yeah, it really is that idea of creating that core piece of content that goes on the website and then figuring out all the different useful ways we can point to it and link to it and drive interested folks to it.

785
01:21:23,552 --> 01:21:28,894
So the email thing is certainly another idea that we could consider exploring.

786
01:21:32,057 --> 01:21:32,398
Lisa.

787
01:21:33,418 --> 01:21:55,278
Yeah, so I also just wanted to add that we do post all of the meeting announcements for school committee, the subcommittees and the regular ones, and any other news you would like on a school committee news board, what they're called and final site and people can subscribe to that board and get an email whenever somebody posts on that, that board.

788
01:21:56,279 --> 01:21:56,939
Wow, that's great.

789
01:21:57,039 --> 01:21:57,900
I did not know that.

790
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:09,593
I have my, we have our own like mechanisms where we get those things, but I get asked somewhat frequently, like, how do I make sure I can get these things that I've never really had a great answer?

791
01:22:09,653 --> 01:22:19,255
So when we talk about like what the website can do and communicating about that, that would be a really helpful example for people who may want that.

792
01:22:19,395 --> 01:22:21,836
And then it might be a little bit easier for people to get to.

793
01:22:22,472 --> 01:22:28,038
Yeah, and that's true of all of our different individual news boards on the website.

794
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:38,970
So if a family at the McGlynn Elementary is interested in getting email updates on McGlynn news as it gets posted, that's also available.

795
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:40,472
Wow, that's great.

796
01:22:40,852 --> 01:22:41,012
Yeah.

797
01:22:41,673 --> 01:22:42,334
Yeah, that's great.

798
01:22:42,854 --> 01:22:43,475
I did not know that.

799
01:22:46,401 --> 01:22:48,021
So we only have a few minutes left.

800
01:22:49,242 --> 01:22:52,443
I feel like we talked about a lot of potential things that could be phase two.

801
01:22:54,163 --> 01:22:59,365
And I didn't know if there were any other questions.

802
01:23:01,066 --> 01:23:01,286
Ms.

803
01:23:01,366 --> 01:23:07,288
Miller and our student website team, whether you had questions for us.

804
01:23:10,051 --> 01:23:12,533
that we could answer for you while we're all here together.

805
01:23:12,553 --> 01:23:25,381
And I think my other question would be whether there are other sort of priorities that our students have that need to be sort of discussed and prioritized as well.

806
01:23:25,541 --> 01:23:27,623
And if you had questions for us about those.

807
01:23:31,195 --> 01:23:35,582
Okay, so we had like one it's kind of big so it doesn't need to be like fully answered now.

808
01:23:36,404 --> 01:23:45,258
But, um, I was talking like kids last year who worked on the website, and like the people this year working on it and we kind of want it to be like, at minimum like an internship because we feel like

809
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:49,694
Programming doesn't have a lot of opportunities for high schoolers.

810
01:23:49,714 --> 01:23:55,116
So we feel like this, along with, this is a big ask, I do admit that, to maybe even get paid.

811
01:23:55,176 --> 01:23:57,557
Because we feel like this is a big job.

812
01:23:57,617 --> 01:23:58,577
It's very professional.

813
01:23:58,597 --> 01:24:04,419
It's stuff that typically adults with sometimes bachelor's degrees use have to do this job.

814
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:09,741
So we feel like it could be, if having it at least be an internship would be really good for us.

815
01:24:09,961 --> 01:24:12,042
We understand this is a big, big question, though.

816
01:24:12,944 --> 01:24:16,067
Um, so it's okay if like we guys can immediately answer this now.

817
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:22,434
Um, no, Rachel, that's a great question and a suggestion.

818
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:28,459
And I definitely, I don't have an answer for you now, but I do have maybe some other questions for the superintendent.

819
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:35,987
Um, and for miss Miller, like we, I think we're not that versed in what it takes to sort of create.

820
01:24:37,518 --> 01:24:43,403
an internship type role that meets like the educational standards, right?

821
01:24:43,463 --> 01:24:47,546
That your shop needs to sort of adhere to, right?

822
01:24:47,606 --> 01:25:01,937
Because we would wanna make sure that if we're gonna go down this road, that there's actually all the requirements are met because I know that the, you know, in vocational education, there's all kinds of like rules and sort of rules of the road that have to be complied with.

823
01:25:01,977 --> 01:25:05,960
So I think my question for the superintendent and Ms.

824
01:25:06,020 --> 01:25:06,640
Miller is,

825
01:25:08,627 --> 01:25:23,239
whether there's something that you need from us to sort of pursue that, or if that's like a takeaway that you can take and consider how we might be able to sort of formalize this into an internship role.

826
01:25:23,259 --> 01:25:28,603
And I mean, I think the possibilities of like the kinds of things that we need are somewhat endless.

827
01:25:30,284 --> 01:25:36,650
And certainly, you know, year to year, there could be, you know, lots of good stuff going on there.

828
01:25:38,043 --> 01:25:38,203
Ms.

829
01:25:38,223 --> 01:25:38,463
Miller?

830
01:25:38,483 --> 01:25:43,290
I had a question to Member McLaughlin, I mean Member Graham.

831
01:25:43,956 --> 01:25:45,137
Okay, Ms.

832
01:25:45,157 --> 01:25:45,977
Miller, did you wanna go first?

833
01:25:46,638 --> 01:25:54,223
So just quickly, so there are two different types of work for seniors in the vocational school, co-ops and internships.

834
01:25:54,283 --> 01:25:57,986
I think there are more rigid guidelines and requirements for co-ops.

835
01:25:58,526 --> 01:26:02,028
The internships are a little less strict.

836
01:26:02,529 --> 01:26:10,214
And I think that I could work with Chad Fallon on trying to figure out what exactly would be required for an internship.

837
01:26:10,274 --> 01:26:13,196
We did have one of our students intern at City Hall last year.

838
01:26:13,596 --> 01:26:15,877
And so we have that as sort of a basis to build upon.

839
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:17,558
Great.

840
01:26:18,218 --> 01:26:18,798
Superintendent?

841
01:26:19,319 --> 01:26:35,446
Yes, and I just wanted to comment that I definitely would need to bring in Mr. Fallon into the conversation, but also from an equity perspective, I really would just want to say, as I think about all of the vocational programs,

842
01:26:36,306 --> 01:26:49,365
From robotics and engineering to our CNAs to automotive and construction, craft, labor, depending what year students are in.

843
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:51,526
and what they're doing.

844
01:26:52,886 --> 01:27:07,073
I just feel like it's a much bigger topic because you could also have shifts in students selecting different vocational programs based on

845
01:27:09,378 --> 01:27:10,778
based on the compensation.

846
01:27:11,419 --> 01:27:21,421
And like in, I'm just saying it like in culinary and everyone's learning different crafts, different trades in every single area.

847
01:27:21,481 --> 01:27:33,284
And we do have to look at it on a case-by-case basis, but I would really wanna have Principal Fallon involved in the conversation and really just think about how,

848
01:27:34,984 --> 01:27:39,548
doing something like that, how it would impact any of the other programs.

849
01:27:39,608 --> 01:27:54,478
So I just want to say I think it's important for students to definitely get real world experience, but I wouldn't want it to be something where we end up pitting, not intentionally but unintentionally, one program against another.

850
01:27:55,779 --> 01:28:16,826
And so I just wanted to put that out there because I support all of the programming and all of the different opportunities that students have to learn and creating those co-op experiences where students do get to go out into the field and receive compensation for it.

851
01:28:16,906 --> 01:28:20,368
So I just want to put that out there because

852
01:28:22,901 --> 01:28:26,804
we need to have a lot more people at the table to have a meaningful discussion.

853
01:28:27,924 --> 01:28:28,205
Sure.

854
01:28:28,425 --> 01:28:31,667
So, and member McLaughlin, I think you had your hand in the air as well.

855
01:28:33,488 --> 01:28:34,109
Yeah, I did.

856
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:39,572
And just, I know this is not on the agenda for the, you know, for the internship or what have you.

857
01:28:39,612 --> 01:28:42,194
So I just want to be mindful of that as well.

858
01:28:42,834 --> 01:28:51,180
And I guess I would just say to the students in particular, I think it's always really good in terms of just policy and a policy memo and drafting anything like that.

859
01:28:51,560 --> 01:29:09,015
to demonstrate like how many hours you've put in, what that's looked like, and what would a comparable rate be in the community for that, right, so that you're talking numbers in terms of, you know, what you've actually done and what you've saved the school from paying and the hard work that you've done and, you know, all of those things.

860
01:29:09,055 --> 01:29:14,240
So I would really encourage you to put that material together as this is being considered as well.

861
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:33,010
Yeah, I think that's actually a great suggestion in terms of like thinking about how this becomes potentially a more formalized thing that could continue one year to the next is to like actually just, you know, sort of make a proposal in a business case.

862
01:29:34,531 --> 01:29:36,392
for the district to consider.

863
01:29:36,532 --> 01:29:47,635
And I think to the extent that superintendent you need or want members of the school committee at the table in this discussion, we certainly can do that.

864
01:29:48,675 --> 01:29:57,217
But I would assume that by and large, like this takeaway is for you all to sort of think about and report back to us on, is that fair?

865
01:29:57,237 --> 01:29:57,297
Yes.

866
01:30:01,092 --> 01:30:02,153
Okay, great.

867
01:30:04,154 --> 01:30:05,054
Motion to adjourn.

868
01:30:06,255 --> 01:30:08,176
Is that a motion to continue?

869
01:30:08,916 --> 01:30:10,737
Oh, motion to continue, yes, thank you.

870
01:30:11,317 --> 01:30:20,122
