1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:02,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Kerins is present to answer any questions.

2
00:00:02,853 --> 00:00:03,654
[SPEAKER_11]: Commissioner Kerins.

3
00:00:06,897 --> 00:00:08,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

4
00:00:10,159 --> 00:00:13,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Brian Kerins, 6 Milton Terrace and Hyde Park.

5
00:00:15,363 --> 00:00:16,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you explain what we're talking about?

6
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:23,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, the truck that we're talking about, Mr. President, is to replace the existing truck.

7
00:00:24,063 --> 00:00:35,029
[SPEAKER_05]: which was in 1999, it has been out of service now for about a year due to age fatigue and it's economically not feasible to replace it.

8
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:50,458
[SPEAKER_05]: This particular truck would maintain and manage the flow, so to speak, of the sewer mains, the storm sewer mains, and in addition to that, cleaning the storm sewers in the city.

9
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:56,626
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

10
00:00:57,587 --> 00:00:58,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

11
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:05,850
[SPEAKER_04]: So I take it in the past year, what have we done, Mr. Kerens, to rectify this issue during the absence of this vehicle?

12
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,632
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had to rely solely on outside contractors.

13
00:01:09,752 --> 00:01:12,713
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's been a pretty penny, I suppose.

14
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:20,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Just as an example, if I were to call today for a VACTA truck, if available, it's $2,500 a day, quarter to portal.

15
00:01:21,056 --> 00:01:22,977
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, if I recall,

16
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:34,905
[SPEAKER_04]: This vehicle assists us in making sure that we eliminate any flooding in neighborhoods, I believe, is that one of the?

17
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:39,669
[SPEAKER_05]: It helps to manage it, depending on what type of an event it is.

18
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:41,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

19
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:52,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, again, this is one of the initiatives I think we all have spoken about, making sure that our DPW is equipped with the proper equipment to make sure that

20
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,492
[SPEAKER_04]: our city can run as it should.

21
00:01:56,612 --> 00:02:08,061
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, especially thinking about the, what we've lost and revenue due to the fact that we've had to go and outsource it at $2,500 a day to me is, is frightening.

22
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:14,325
[SPEAKER_04]: So I, uh, strongly, um, accept this, uh, this motion and the purchase of this machine.

23
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:15,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

24
00:02:15,186 --> 00:02:15,566
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

25
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:17,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

26
00:02:17,408 --> 00:02:18,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

27
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:20,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Mr. Karens, a couple of quick questions.

28
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,712
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the average lifespan for a vehicle like this?

29
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:24,936
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a good point.

30
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:26,218
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a good point.

31
00:02:41,687 --> 00:02:52,653
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a window of time in the summer that the health, working with the health department, all right, they put pellets into the catch basins for, you know, the storm sewer.

32
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,395
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, we ceased for a couple of months during the summer.

33
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:55,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

34
00:02:55,915 --> 00:02:56,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

35
00:02:56,455 --> 00:03:02,278
[SPEAKER_05]: But that, okay, you know, that doesn't have anything to do with the actual domestic sewer lines that get backed up.

36
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:02,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

37
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:03,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

38
00:03:03,699 --> 00:03:07,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I, I second the, the resolution and move approval.

39
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:08,442
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

40
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:08,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

41
00:03:09,732 --> 00:03:10,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Dello Russo.

42
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:13,954
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, I'm delighted to also endorse this project.

43
00:03:14,755 --> 00:03:16,396
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing's too good for the people of Medford.

44
00:03:17,516 --> 00:03:17,957
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

45
00:03:18,337 --> 00:03:19,277
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lango-Kern.

46
00:03:19,898 --> 00:03:21,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

47
00:03:21,498 --> 00:03:25,481
[SPEAKER_17]: It says on the paperwork that it's, the estimate is $409,000.

48
00:03:25,521 --> 00:03:29,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you know where we're going to get the extra $10,000?

49
00:03:29,863 --> 00:03:39,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that would have to be worked out with the, you know, Treasurer's office and purchasing, but the money is there, Madam Vice President.

50
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,941
[SPEAKER_17]: So we're going to find the other 10 somewhere else.

51
00:03:42,981 --> 00:03:43,662
[SPEAKER_05]: That's correct.

52
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:47,844
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, maybe if we could just ask the question, where's the other 10,000 going to come from?

53
00:03:47,904 --> 00:03:50,686
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you could ask where the other 10,000 will be coming from.

54
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:52,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

55
00:03:52,968 --> 00:03:58,811
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you could just name what other pieces of equipment are you in dire need for besides this?

56
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:10,218
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, last year, last year, uh, per the mayor's request, uh, I had submitted a capital plan for a few years as far as the actual, you know, turning over of,

57
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:14,247
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment, uh, within all departments within public works.

58
00:04:14,968 --> 00:04:30,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we're now into our second year and, uh, we'll be, you know, phasing out some of the light duty vehicles, the one ton dumps, the pickup trucks that in most cases are, you know, around 10 years old and, uh, are in, uh, you know, deteriorating pretty rapidly.

59
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:33,355
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

60
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:33,555
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

61
00:04:33,575 --> 00:04:33,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

62
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:35,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Knight.

63
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:37,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

64
00:04:37,857 --> 00:04:38,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, Mr. Cairns, how are you?

65
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:39,278
[SPEAKER_05]: Fine.

66
00:04:39,298 --> 00:04:39,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

67
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:39,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Good.

68
00:04:40,485 --> 00:04:42,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we able to perform the maintenance on this vehicle in-house?

69
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:47,348
[SPEAKER_14]: The maintenance and upkeep on this vehicle, would it be able to be performed in-house?

70
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,469
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the preventive maintenance.

71
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:56,973
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, any kind of repairs that would have to be done to it would be covered under a warranty plan with the company we purchase it from.

72
00:04:57,193 --> 00:04:57,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

73
00:04:59,294 --> 00:05:00,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Mox.

74
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:01,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

75
00:05:02,815 --> 00:05:08,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Kerins, we currently subcontract out for the cleaning of our catch basins.

76
00:05:09,255 --> 00:05:09,655
[SPEAKER_08]: currently.

77
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:10,416
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

78
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:17,119
[SPEAKER_08]: And with this piece of equipment, are we going to maintain the same contract or are we going to be able to do a lot of it in house?

79
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, we'll do a fair amount of it in house.

80
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:30,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor, uh, keeping in mind there's a 4,555 storm drains in this city that public works has to manage.

81
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:36,829
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, our target is, has been all right to at least, you know, get a minimum,

82
00:05:38,248 --> 00:05:40,870
[SPEAKER_05]: of half of that every single year.

83
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Our goal is to try to get everything.

84
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:50,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, it would depend on weather, personnel availability, but at two o'clock in the morning, we have a backup somewhere.

85
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:56,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I have nothing to rely on as far as in-house equipment.

86
00:05:56,597 --> 00:06:03,260
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, public safety, public health dictates we have to address the issue right away.

87
00:06:04,307 --> 00:06:08,068
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so currently right now we're, we're doing, we're trying to get to at least half of them.

88
00:06:09,408 --> 00:06:10,869
[SPEAKER_08]: That's, that's a mandatory minimum.

89
00:06:11,489 --> 00:06:14,550
[SPEAKER_08]: And is that through the private contract that we have or is that?

90
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,870
[SPEAKER_08]: That's private contract.

91
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,410
[SPEAKER_08]: That's correct.

92
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:20,412
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to, we're going to maintain that contract and then have this piece of equipment.

93
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:24,153
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to be able to do more than half now with this piece of equipment.

94
00:06:24,433 --> 00:06:24,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

95
00:06:25,173 --> 00:06:32,095
[SPEAKER_05]: What, what are, what our goal would be is to bring down possibly, all right, you know,

96
00:06:32,499 --> 00:06:38,083
[SPEAKER_05]: the contract, the inner, the outside contractor as far as, you know, his availability.

97
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:47,050
[SPEAKER_05]: We definitely, we need, you know, more than one vehicle out there because again, we lose the summer months, right?

98
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:56,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Where we cannot do any storm basin cleaning at all from, from June, right through the end of September, those months are gone per the request of the board of health.

99
00:06:56,757 --> 00:06:59,279
[SPEAKER_05]: So they can put the mosquito pellets in the catch basins.

100
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:15,731
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, and it also really would depend on what kind of weather events we have throughout the year, you know, whether it be bad rain storms or whatever that could clean or clog these bases with all kinds of trash and debris, because sometimes they can, some of them can fill up very fast.

101
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:17,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

102
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:29,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause back, back some years ago, maybe even before you became a commissioner, uh, we used to get through a hundred percent of the storm drains and every year they would market a different color, yellow,

103
00:07:29,972 --> 00:07:32,814
[SPEAKER_08]: blue, orange to know which drains were completed.

104
00:07:33,355 --> 00:07:41,762
[SPEAKER_08]: And over the years, I think it's, um, we kind of took money from that particular account and weren't able to get to as many storm drains.

105
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:48,908
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm happy to hear that if we're able to maintain that current contract and then this be additional,

106
00:07:49,601 --> 00:07:50,822
[SPEAKER_08]: because it's vital.

107
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,183
[SPEAKER_08]: We have flooding in every part of it.

108
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:53,003
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have to tell you.

109
00:07:53,744 --> 00:08:05,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Every part of the community has flooding and largely due to catch basins that end up filling up and get clogged from leaves and sand and everything else that clogs them.

110
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:09,775
[SPEAKER_08]: And it creates flooding in people's basements and so forth.

111
00:08:10,275 --> 00:08:12,897
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm pleased to hear that we're purchasing this equipment.

112
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:16,540
[SPEAKER_08]: It's needed in the community of this size.

113
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,721
[SPEAKER_08]: And I support it tonight, Mr. President.

114
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:21,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

115
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:25,280
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

116

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_11]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

132
00:08:43,804 --> 00:08:44,784
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

137
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:57,164

138
00:08:57,184 --> 00:08:57,924
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

139
00:08:57,964 --> 00:09:03,388

142
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:17,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I'm sorry.

143
00:09:18,884 --> 00:09:20,846

[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

147
00:09:40,704 --> 00:09:45,628
[SPEAKER_17]: As we all are aware, last Tuesday there was a Zoning Board of Appeals meeting that

148
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:48,604
[SPEAKER_17]: coincided with the Medford City Council meeting.

149
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:55,589
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know a number of us stuck around to attend that Zoning Board of Appeals meeting when it moved to the council chambers.

150
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:10,278
[SPEAKER_17]: The reason there was so much issue was because of the notification of a proposed project by the city of Medford, not by the developer, by the city of Medford.

151
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:13,820
[SPEAKER_17]: And it seems that people who live

152
00:10:14,223 --> 00:10:18,624
[SPEAKER_17]: across the street from the project were not notified of such a meeting.

153
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:31,088
[SPEAKER_17]: They had to find out of the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting through City Council alderman from Somerville who happened to litter the neighborhood about a meeting that Somerville was having.

154
00:10:31,648 --> 00:10:40,010
[SPEAKER_17]: So once our residents in the neighborhood found out, and I believe there was 10 or 11 people here last Tuesday at the zoning meeting,

155
00:10:40,508 --> 00:10:45,330
[SPEAKER_17]: that weren't present during the initial zoning meeting in September because they had no notification.

156
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:54,173
[SPEAKER_17]: They were here last week and wanted to speak on the proposal, wanted to ask questions, had concerns, and they weren't notified.

157
00:10:54,273 --> 00:11:03,696
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would like to get a list from the administration of exactly who was notified, a breakdown of just the name and address of all those that were notified.

158
00:11:03,756 --> 00:11:09,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Very simple request, but in future resolutions I have on the agenda tonight,

159
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,581
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, it speaks to giving more notifications.

160
00:11:12,641 --> 00:11:17,165
[SPEAKER_17]: So we don't run into these problems like we did last week, which is extremely unfortunate.

161
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:28,975
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's holding up the process of that specific development more than it should because of what went down last Tuesday and why it went down and lack of notification is a big part of this.

162
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:37,742
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we could be provided that, um, that would be very helpful and we can better understand when we are getting a complaint or an email or a concern, we know,

163
00:11:38,422 --> 00:11:43,766
[SPEAKER_17]: why we're getting it now versus in September when this initially should have taken place and probably been resolved.

164
00:11:44,406 --> 00:11:47,188
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll just move approval on that, ask for a roll call vote.

165
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:52,312
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Councilor Locurin, seconded by Councilor Falco.

166
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:55,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, a roll call vote has been requested.

167
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:03,019
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Feliciano?

168
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:03,119
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

169
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,841
Councilor Falco?

170
00:12:05,061 --> 00:12:05,281
Yes.

171
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:06,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight?

172
00:12:06,442 --> 00:12:06,582
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

173
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:07,903
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Locurin?

174
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,159
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

175
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,101
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

176
00:12:12,241 --> 00:12:12,522
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

177
00:12:14,163 --> 00:12:14,443
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

178
00:12:14,643 --> 00:12:15,784
[SPEAKER_11]: A seven in the affirmative.

179
00:12:15,804 --> 00:12:16,584
[SPEAKER_11]: None in the negative.

180
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:19,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes 17 seven to eight off of my council.

181
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:31,955
[SPEAKER_11]: Lungo can be a resolve that the Medford city council at a city ordinance that requires all zoning board of appeals meetings to be held at times that do not conflict with the Medford city council Tuesday evening meetings.

182
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:33,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Counsel Lungo can.

183
00:12:33,497 --> 00:12:33,957
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

184
00:12:33,997 --> 00:12:36,819
[SPEAKER_17]: President Carve yellow over the last several years, I've been,

185
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:54,486
[SPEAKER_17]: and a number of my colleagues here on the city council have been interested and concerned about the development in Medford and interested in zoning OCD, different types of meetings that are going on, most importantly being the one, the board that gives the variances for certain developments, which is a zoning board of appeals meeting.

186
00:12:54,966 --> 00:12:59,047
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we've discussed a number of times to make it more transparent.

187
00:12:59,107 --> 00:13:01,828
[SPEAKER_17]: We want all public city meetings to go live.

188
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:06,370
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is just one request that a number of residents brought up to me over the last

189
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:23,267
[SPEAKER_17]: several days after the Tuesday night meeting, especially where you have a few of us on the council running back and forth to the zoning board of appeals meetings because there are such important issues that are going to affect large areas, big neighborhoods in Medford and affect everybody that lives there.

190
00:13:23,648 --> 00:13:25,649
[SPEAKER_17]: Yet our meetings are being held at the same time.

191
00:13:25,669 --> 00:13:32,694
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I think that we, I asked my colleagues to vote to update our ordinances and make this part of our city ordinances.

192
00:13:32,794 --> 00:13:34,035
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm asking for that vote tonight.

193
00:13:34,455 --> 00:13:36,577
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not asking for it to go to the committee.

194
00:13:37,114 --> 00:13:47,698
[SPEAKER_17]: On zoning, I'm asking for an official vote to make sure that the Zoning Board of Appeals meetings are held any other night besides Tuesday night at 7 p.m.

195
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:50,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

196
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:51,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

197
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:54,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to go on record of supporting this resolution.

198
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,421
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a good resolution.

199
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:58,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Zoning is one of the most important responsibilities that we have.

200
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:00,897
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, on the city council.

201
00:14:01,137 --> 00:14:05,939
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that, uh, we need to make sure that we have the opportunity to attend these meetings.

202
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:11,961
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, especially when you have major developments, uh, that are going in, uh, people call us, they want answers.

203
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:16,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, so we should, uh, you know, have the opportunity to attend those meetings.

204
00:14:16,363 --> 00:14:19,684
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the meetings occur at the same time, then something has to give.

205
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:29,027
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that, uh, then moving, uh, the zoning, uh, board moving those meetings to another night, I think would be ideal for everyone, uh, in the community.

206
00:14:30,393 --> 00:14:36,437
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also believe that, and I mentioned this before in the past, they shouldn't be held in the room across the hall.

207
00:14:37,017 --> 00:14:38,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Zoning board meetings should be held here.

208
00:14:39,418 --> 00:14:47,523
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to a zoning board meeting, it's ridiculous that people have to stand in the hallway to find out what's going on, especially if it's a big issue.

209
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:51,725
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't even hear the presentation that's being put on by the developer.

210
00:14:52,105 --> 00:14:57,148
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be in support or non-support, but you still can't hear the presentation.

211
00:14:57,909 --> 00:14:58,529
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't do,

212
00:14:59,472 --> 00:15:00,613
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't benefit anyone.

213
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,395
[SPEAKER_02]: So really, in my opinion, they shouldn't be held in that room.

214
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:06,797
[SPEAKER_02]: They should be on a night other than Tuesday night.

215
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:19,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm hoping that when we have the legislative software that's going to be installed hopefully soon, we'll have those meetings on tape, and people will be able to watch them 24-7.

216
00:15:19,845 --> 00:15:24,948
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the documents will be accessible 24-7 as well.

217
00:15:25,348 --> 00:15:26,409
[SPEAKER_02]: So I support the resolution.

218
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:27,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I second the resolution.

219
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:28,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

220
00:15:29,067 --> 00:15:29,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Dello Russo.

221
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:31,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Trick or treat, Mr. President.

222
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:46,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, the minutes, the agendas of various boards and commissions are posted on the city website in advance of their meetings.

223
00:15:47,331 --> 00:15:54,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, the Zoning Board of Appeals has often been presented to me by legal authorities as being a semi-judiciary board.

224
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:10,515
[SPEAKER_09]: They make a judicious decisions, uh, regarding alleviating, alleviating, uh, encumbrances or, uh, the actual letter of the law regarding our zoning.

225
00:16:11,056 --> 00:16:21,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, they can be on great matters or small matters, expanding your front porch, uh, widening your driveway, uh, things of that nature, Mr. President.

226
00:16:22,142 --> 00:16:25,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and, and one of the things that protects that board,

227
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:28,329
[SPEAKER_09]: is that it's free from political influence.

228
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:34,476
[SPEAKER_09]: It's free from the influence of city councilors going in there, the mayor telling them what to do.

229
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:36,738
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the way it's set up.

230
00:16:37,439 --> 00:16:40,823
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, Mr. President,

231
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:51,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Given the way this was just presented to us by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, I cannot support that because we don't have language to change our ordinance.

232
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:59,119
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm certainly not going to change our ordinance blindly without having a text before us.

233
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:04,464
[SPEAKER_09]: Secondly, Mr. President, I wouldn't dare touch this without proper legal advice.

234
00:17:04,944 --> 00:17:09,586
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would think that an officer of the court would know that, Mr. President.

235
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:17,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree, I wholeheartedly agree that there are some flaws with the way people have access to that meeting room.

236
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:25,811
[SPEAKER_09]: It certainly isn't to a standard that people would want, but that needs to be addressed too, Mr. President.

237
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:33,333
[SPEAKER_09]: But to change the, by ordinance, when an independent board can meet,

238
00:17:34,205 --> 00:17:44,593
[SPEAKER_09]: to make it subject to influence by members of a separate political body, Mr. President, I don't think is good business.

239
00:17:45,434 --> 00:17:45,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

240
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:48,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Mox.

241
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:51,939
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I support this resolution.

242
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:01,487
[SPEAKER_08]: The Zoning Board of Appeals is a public board, and members of this council, members of the community,

243
00:18:02,265 --> 00:18:03,946
[SPEAKER_08]: have the right to speak before this board.

244
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:09,830
[SPEAKER_08]: And in my opinion, I was elected to do so to represent the people of this community.

245
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:13,852
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not going to take a backseat, Mr. President, when it comes to that.

246
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,894
[SPEAKER_08]: So everyone behind this reel is entitled to their opinion.

247
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:30,503
[SPEAKER_08]: But I agree with my colleagues that spoke that when you have a public meeting for a neighborhood and a room that holds maybe 20 to 25 people at best is not enough.

248
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:31,984
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you have,

249
00:18:32,545 --> 00:18:41,813
[SPEAKER_08]: half the crowd in the hallway, as Councilor Falco mentioned, that can't hear what's going on, that's going to have a direct impact on them and their quality of life.

250
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:43,534
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a problem with that.

251
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:54,663
[SPEAKER_08]: And if no one else wants to talk about it, we as representatives of the people in this community have every right to stand up on behalf of the residents, Mr. President.

252
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:59,527
[SPEAKER_08]: So I support this wholeheartedly, Mr. President, that, um,

253
00:19:00,058 --> 00:19:04,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Boards of commissions in this community, first of all, should be subject to being televised.

254
00:19:05,761 --> 00:19:10,844
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great that they're keeping their minutes, and I would hope they do so, and they ratify their minutes.

255
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:22,751
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's also important that we, as residents, those that may be homebound, that can't get out to these particular meetings, have access to see what's going on in government.

256
00:19:23,292 --> 00:19:24,352
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called good government.

257
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:28,675
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Boards of Appeals is part of this government.

258
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:31,306
[SPEAKER_08]: They are an autonomous board, that's correct.

259
00:19:32,387 --> 00:19:34,588
[SPEAKER_08]: But they also are part of this city.

260
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:53,478
[SPEAKER_08]: And when residents come up and hear someone from a board say, sorry sir, that portion of the meeting is over, we can't hear from you right now, or our rules prevent you from speaking right now, in my opinion, does a disservice to every taxpayer in this community.

261
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:56,709
[SPEAKER_08]: every taxpayer in this community.

262
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:06,294
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have never been part of a board, commission, whatever you want to call it, that will tell people, residents that come up, sorry, we can't hear you tonight.

263
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:08,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, that portion is over.

264
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:09,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, our rules.

265
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:11,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to the council rules.

266
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:15,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any council rules that say residents can't come up and address this council?

267
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,400
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely not.

268
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,721
[SPEAKER_08]: We could suspend the rules at any given time to allow residents to come up.

269
00:20:22,161 --> 00:20:26,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Even if we're past that portion of the agenda, we could still go back.

270
00:20:26,562 --> 00:20:28,562
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what happened the other night, Mr. President.

271
00:20:29,323 --> 00:20:41,305
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you have a board member, Mr. President, that takes it one step further, saying the fact that they have to issue so many variances is because the city council hasn't done their job updating the zoning.

272
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:43,846
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not the reason, Mr. President.

273
00:20:44,246 --> 00:20:45,286
[SPEAKER_08]: The zoning's in place.

274
00:20:46,152 --> 00:20:49,993
[SPEAKER_08]: They're given variances, Mr. President, that should be given out for hardships.

275
00:20:51,013 --> 00:20:59,574
[SPEAKER_08]: And building multiple units and raising a building as high as possible is not a hardship based on the fact that developers are going to make a lot more money.

276
00:20:59,914 --> 00:21:01,075
[SPEAKER_08]: That is not a hardship.

277
00:21:03,435 --> 00:21:14,557
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think, honestly, Mr. President, that in addition, I know Councilor Longo has another resolution on a little further in, but we also have to look, Mr. President,

278
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,531
[SPEAKER_08]: at the notification process.

279
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:24,234
[SPEAKER_08]: By state law, the minimum requirement is within 300 feet of the development.

280
00:21:24,735 --> 00:21:26,475
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the minimum requirement.

281
00:21:27,056 --> 00:21:29,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I asked the board the other night when they were in deliberation.

282
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:33,138
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go above the minimum requirement.

283
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:34,939
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go below the state law.

284
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:36,240
[SPEAKER_08]: You can go above.

285
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Why doesn't this board request that the developer notify

286
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:49,130
[SPEAKER_08]: 400, 500, 600, 700 feet, 1,000 feet, to make sure the neighborhood is aware of what's going on, Mr. President.

287
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:51,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was told, well, that's a great expense.

288
00:21:57,476 --> 00:22:03,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Expense is $300 for this community.

289
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:04,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Notify.

290
00:22:05,602 --> 00:22:08,104
[SPEAKER_08]: The biggest issue I heard.

291
00:22:10,547 --> 00:22:37,201
[SPEAKER_08]: was development I'm sure there's things that the notification process and once right feel being done behind their back that's when they're going to come out so if the patient to drug which I've been asking for for years on this council that's notified if I can get to one case behind

292
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:44,181
[SPEAKER_08]: But we can't notify residents that they're going to build a five-story building next to their home.

293
00:22:44,582 --> 00:22:45,442
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a problem.

294
00:22:46,083 --> 00:22:47,343
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a problem, Mr. President.

295
00:22:48,284 --> 00:22:55,208
[SPEAKER_08]: I get four to five calls, in my opinion, that residents aren't really getting, with no one.

296
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:06,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Just like Eversource and other projects that are going to air in this community, there's nothing being sent out.

297
00:23:07,676 --> 00:23:08,857
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a problem, Mr. President.

298
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:09,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

299
00:23:09,773 --> 00:23:10,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

300
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,255
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

301
00:23:12,895 --> 00:23:14,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

302
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:20,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I had mentioned earlier that I believe that the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting should be held in Alden Chambers.

303
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,762
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be held in City Council Chambers.

304
00:23:22,942 --> 00:23:30,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to have a resolution that the Zoning Board of Appeals meetings be held in Alden Chambers.

305
00:23:32,868 --> 00:23:33,289
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

306
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:33,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

307
00:23:34,509 --> 00:23:35,250
[SPEAKER_11]: Council Member O'Connor.

308
00:23:36,724 --> 00:23:37,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

309
00:23:37,845 --> 00:23:44,451
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to point out the website, city website was mentioned, and I think that's also part of the problem.

310
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:59,143
[SPEAKER_17]: Over the last, again, year, year and a half where we've had some serious Zoning Board of Appeals meetings with some serious decisions, I've got repeated complaints from residents who went on our city website, and for some reason,

311
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:07,533
[SPEAKER_17]: The OCD meetings and the Zoning Board of Appeal meetings were some of the only meetings that were left off the city calendar on the city website.

312
00:24:07,953 --> 00:24:19,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Leave it to coincidence, I don't know, but I've gotten multiple complaints about that over the last couple of years, and that raises a red flag and brings a whole other leg to this problem.

313
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:27,462
[SPEAKER_17]: Secondly, it was referred that I'm an officer of the court and I should know that we need legal language.

314
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,771
[SPEAKER_17]: I just have to disagree with that.

315
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:32,152
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not an attorney when I sit behind this rail.

316
00:24:32,312 --> 00:24:42,016
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm voted in to represent the people, the neighborhoods, and those that have a concern and want things to change.

317
00:24:43,376 --> 00:24:58,002
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to sit here and allow this to go to the zoning committee where we sent things a year, year and a half ago, and they either sat there or were squashed by the person that's telling me I should be an officer of the court.

318
00:24:58,938 --> 00:25:12,769
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so I asked for a vote tonight that we change our ordinance to make sure it's simple zoning board of appeals meetings be held at times that do not conflict with the Medford city council Tuesday evening meetings, period.

319
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:14,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

320
00:25:16,672 --> 00:25:17,432
[SPEAKER_11]: Counsel Scarpelli.

321
00:25:17,712 --> 00:25:27,520
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can, um, Mr. President, real quick, I know that, uh, last week I did come in a little late and the, uh, there was a little confusion that the councils might not have,

322
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:34,388
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, word was some councils weren't interested in what was going on the zoning board meeting because they weren't attending that meeting.

323
00:25:34,808 --> 00:25:41,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate my colleagues being there, but just for a public notification, I feel very strongly about this issue.

324
00:25:42,069 --> 00:25:45,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we've talked about our zoning and reviewing our zoning.

325
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate council Lungo current for bringing this forward because I think this is very important and I support it.

326
00:25:51,251 --> 00:25:56,872
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but again, uh, what, what just to set the record straight,

327
00:25:57,451 --> 00:26:00,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to be there just as much as any of the other Councilors.

328
00:26:00,813 --> 00:26:03,815
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, and this is one of the reasons why I support this.

329
00:26:04,535 --> 00:26:21,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I felt at the time that the job that that was given to us with what we had on the, on the calendar, uh, was minimal that I wanted to attend that whole meeting and listen to the concerns of those citizens that called me and emailed me so we can give them the answers that they needed.

330
00:26:21,946 --> 00:26:26,609
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to just wanted to throw that out there to make sure people understood that, that for this Councilor,

331
00:26:27,534 --> 00:26:39,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel just as strong as I think every council behind this rail about what's happening with zoning issues and what happened at that meeting because it went downhill pretty fast and that's not the way to do business in our community.

332
00:26:39,346 --> 00:26:40,307
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

333
00:26:41,187 --> 00:26:42,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor Scott Peli.

334
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record, please.

335
00:26:46,227 --> 00:26:48,148
[SPEAKER_06]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

336
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:51,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to talk a little bit on this as far as the zoning.

337
00:26:51,609 --> 00:27:06,674
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been up here before talking about zoning and how desperately we need to have that conversation to move the city forward because of the simple fact that we will have construction going on and new programs and great ideas coming into the city.

338
00:27:07,154 --> 00:27:10,495
[SPEAKER_06]: They shouldn't be stalled because we can't figure out what to do with zoning.

339
00:27:10,935 --> 00:27:12,796
[SPEAKER_06]: Zoning is a contract.

340
00:27:12,936 --> 00:27:14,777
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a contract with the neighborhoods.

341
00:27:15,538 --> 00:27:19,742
[SPEAKER_06]: It's telling the neighborhoods, this is the direction that we've all decided the city will go.

342
00:27:20,502 --> 00:27:28,209
[SPEAKER_06]: So to have variances which are granted, they're exceptions to the rules, like you were saying, hardship cases.

343
00:27:28,269 --> 00:27:33,573
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not exceptions to the rule where we can squeeze something into a space and make it work.

344
00:27:34,033 --> 00:27:35,755
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not what the variance is for.

345
00:27:36,713 --> 00:27:51,246
[SPEAKER_06]: So to take that and to say that you folks who represent the citizens, you do not work for the administration, you represent the citizens, to not go to a board of appeals meeting makes absolutely no sense.

346
00:27:51,646 --> 00:27:52,868
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to stand your ground.

347
00:27:53,188 --> 00:27:57,131
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to support the citizens of the neighborhoods until we get the zoning problem solved.

348
00:27:57,612 --> 00:28:01,115
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you can't do that, then you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing.

349
00:28:01,555 --> 00:28:02,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much.

350
00:28:02,316 --> 00:28:03,257
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

351
00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:12,712
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Falco.

352
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:17,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, as amended by Councilor Falco.

353
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:19,817
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

354
00:28:24,781 --> 00:28:25,521

[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco?

357
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:27,863
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

00:28:28,824 --> 00:28:30,025
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

360
00:28:30,065 --> 00:28:30,805
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Kern?

361
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:31,166
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

362
00:28:31,906 --> 00:28:32,607
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Martins?

363
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:33,187
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

364
00:28:34,028 --> 00:28:34,828
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli?

365
00:28:34,968 --> 00:28:35,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

366
00:28:35,789 --> 00:28:36,490
[SPEAKER_16]: President Calvillo?

367
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:37,030
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

368
00:28:39,512 --> 00:28:46,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Three in the negative, four in the affirmative, motion passes.

369
00:28:46,914 --> 00:28:48,294
[SPEAKER_11]: 17-729, offered by Councilor Kern.

370
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:51,475
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

371
00:28:53,415 --> 00:28:55,255
[SPEAKER_11]: You are correct, Mr. Councilor La Rosa.

372
00:28:57,056 --> 00:29:02,517
[SPEAKER_11]: So tonight it will take its, so this will take its first reading this evening, Mr. Clerk.

373
00:29:03,653 --> 00:29:10,375
[SPEAKER_11]: In order that's changed it, we have, we have the language that council and we're going to put in.

374
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:11,875
[SPEAKER_11]: So this will, this will be its first reading.

375
00:29:14,916 --> 00:29:15,196
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

376
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:18,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Vice presidents acceptable to my colleagues.

377
00:29:18,337 --> 00:29:30,941
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd recommend that we send a resolution as approved by the council to the city solicitor so he can craft where it should go within the zoning ordinance and then send it back to us for our, for our debate and our discussion.

378
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:35,060
[SPEAKER_08]: No, send it right to the city solicitor.

379
00:29:38,302 --> 00:29:38,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Layton.

380
00:29:38,903 --> 00:29:43,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, the reason I didn't support the paper was because there was no text and no language for an ordinance to be changed.

381
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:47,128
[SPEAKER_14]: If a paper is going to go to the city solicitor for him to draft one, I have no problem supporting that.

382
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:49,730
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd like to say that I'd be voting in the affirmative for that.

383
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:53,813
[SPEAKER_11]: I would change my vote if it's going to the city solicitor also.

384
00:30:02,825 --> 00:30:12,252
[SPEAKER_14]: Ultimately, Mr. President, the paper says, be it resolved the Medford City Council had a city ordinance that requires all zoning board of appeals to be held at times of conflict with the city council meetings.

385
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,655
[SPEAKER_14]: What section of the zoning ordinance is that going to go in?

386
00:30:15,675 --> 00:30:17,316
[SPEAKER_14]: When is it going to fall under administration of government?

387
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:17,656
[SPEAKER_11]: I would.

388
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,849
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to rescind the vote, Mr. Woods.

389
00:30:25,869 --> 00:30:26,449
[SPEAKER_11]: That hasn't been called.

390
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:28,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion by Councilor Knight to rescind the vote.

391
00:30:29,811 --> 00:30:31,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for reconsideration by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

392
00:30:32,273 --> 00:30:34,694
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

393
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:35,395
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor.

394

[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll again.

395
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:40,578
[SPEAKER_14]: As amended.

396
00:30:40,778 --> 00:30:43,540
[SPEAKER_11]: This is going to, as amended, that this go to the city solicitor.

397
00:30:47,162 --> 00:30:48,383
[SPEAKER_11]: To craft the craft language.

398
00:30:50,885 --> 00:30:51,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

399
00:30:53,006 --> 00:30:54,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

400
00:31:01,027 --> 00:31:01,147
Yes.

401
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:01,708
Councilor Falco.

402
00:31:01,868 --> 00:31:02,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

403
00:31:02,588 --> 00:31:03,088
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Layton.

404
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:03,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

405
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:04,809
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Kern.

406
00:31:04,869 --> 00:31:04,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

407
00:31:05,849 --> 00:31:06,590
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Rodgers.

408
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,190
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

409
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,230
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Scarpelli.

410
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:08,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

411
00:31:09,231 --> 00:31:09,891
[SPEAKER_16]: President Caraviello.

412
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:10,251
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

413
00:31:10,351 --> 00:31:12,992
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

414
00:31:13,773 --> 00:31:15,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

415
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:28,458
[SPEAKER_11]: 17-729, offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, be it resolved that the Medford City Council be provided with the scaled map that was used to figure out which addresses were to be notified of the Zoning Board of Appeals meeting regarding the Medford Street Broadway development.

416
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:29,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

417
00:31:31,333 --> 00:31:32,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

418
00:31:32,674 --> 00:31:37,157
[SPEAKER_17]: I was asked by a resident who lives in the area and wasn't notified for a scaled map.

419
00:31:37,377 --> 00:31:39,919
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it's available in City Hall.

420
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:43,602
[SPEAKER_17]: Wondering if we can all get a copy in our next packet for Friday.

421
00:31:43,622 --> 00:31:55,671
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm basing it really just to see who wasn't notified on this project, but also this with a list of which abutters we already approved, which abutters were notified.

422
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:57,592
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to get an idea of really

423
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:15,000
[SPEAKER_17]: how many people were notifying on a project of this magnitude, because this has been a recurring issue over the last year and a half, two years, where abutters are really upset they're not getting notification, and they live across the street or very, very close to a project.

424
00:32:15,501 --> 00:32:22,902
[SPEAKER_17]: So I really want to take a look at a map, take a look at the abutter list of who was notified, and really figure out where we're going wrong here.

425
00:32:22,922 --> 00:32:27,283
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we have another resolution coming up that more people be notified.

426
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:35,422
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think we can obviously take that vote tonight, but also look in the future to see if we need more than the 300 feet radius.

427
00:32:35,802 --> 00:32:42,266
[SPEAKER_17]: Because we have such serious developments going on in this community, and the more people you notify, the better.

428
00:32:42,286 --> 00:32:48,850
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you're talking about a postage stamp, it's well worth it to allow residents the opportunity to be informed.

429
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:49,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

430
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,372
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Councilor Lococo, seconded by Councilor Falco.

431
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:54,933
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favour?

432
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:55,794
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call.

433
00:32:56,437 --> 00:32:58,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call vote has been requested Mr. Clerk.

434
00:33:07,242 --> 00:33:07,443
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

435
00:33:15,448 --> 00:33:16,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

436
00:33:16,308 --> 00:33:16,609
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

437
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

438
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:22,073
[SPEAKER_11]: 70 in the affirmative and the negative motion pass.

439
00:33:22,093 --> 00:33:22,854
[SPEAKER_17]: Suspension of the rules.

440
00:33:23,214 --> 00:33:25,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Move suspension of the rules by council on the occurrence.

441
00:33:25,556 --> 00:33:27,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by councilor Falco.

442
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:28,379
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor.

443
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

444
00:33:31,121 --> 00:33:32,562
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, thank you, president Caraviello.

445
00:33:32,582 --> 00:33:32,822
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

446
00:33:32,882 --> 00:33:33,283
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilors.

447
00:33:33,323 --> 00:33:42,651
[SPEAKER_17]: If we could allow, there was, like we said last Tuesday at the zoning board of appeals meeting, there was 10 or 11 people who were not given the opportunity to speak.

448
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:44,392
[SPEAKER_17]: of their concerns.

449
00:33:44,552 --> 00:34:02,324
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a few here tonight that would like to speak out and voice their concerns, and I think as a public body, we have to give them that opportunity, and hopefully their concerns will get back to those who are making decisions, and I just think it's the appropriate thing to do.

450
00:34:02,404 --> 00:34:06,627
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like to offer the floor to any residents that would like to speak on that proposal.

451
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:14,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

452
00:34:14,497 --> 00:34:15,638
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address of the record, please.

453
00:34:16,118 --> 00:34:18,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Jillian Chernobyl, 12 Shapely Avenue.

454
00:34:19,315 --> 00:34:26,878
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to speak a little bit because I went to the Board of Appeals meeting last week and was told that I could not speak at that meeting.

455
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:40,863
[SPEAKER_00]: I did go to the building department and I got a scaled map and discovered that my house is about 140 feet away from the development, which is well under the 300-foot radius.

456
00:34:41,864 --> 00:34:48,026
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want some clarification of why we were not notified even though we are well within the 300-foot radius.

457
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:49,640
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

458
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

459
00:34:57,966 --> 00:34:58,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

460
00:34:58,386 --> 00:34:59,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address of the record, please.

461
00:34:59,647 --> 00:35:02,189
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, Pamela Cerullo, five Shapely Avenue.

462
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,413
[SPEAKER_24]: I just like to thank the board again for allowing us to have this opportunity to speak.

463
00:35:08,113 --> 00:35:17,400
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, I do have to agree with Jillian that I'm actually less of a distance from this project than she is.

464
00:35:18,301 --> 00:35:19,642
[SPEAKER_24]: And we were never notified.

465
00:35:19,702 --> 00:35:26,646
[SPEAKER_24]: The only way that I found out about the meeting in Somerville was because Mr. Zamuto actually was walking around handing out flyers.

466
00:35:27,367 --> 00:35:29,148
[SPEAKER_24]: And he happened to hand it personally to me.

467
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:31,629
[SPEAKER_24]: I was glad I was able to at least go there.

468
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:44,537
[SPEAKER_24]: And again, with the fact that the city council meetings were held at the exact same time, once I knew what was happening, my husband and I literally ran from the Somerville meeting to the city council meeting here.

469
00:35:45,258 --> 00:35:45,938
[SPEAKER_24]: But at that point,

470
00:35:46,388 --> 00:35:48,749
[SPEAKER_24]: I couldn't say anything until after the meeting had closed.

471
00:35:49,610 --> 00:36:04,297
[SPEAKER_24]: And thank goodness we had some of the councillors that listened to me and kind of like got me thinking I've got to get something going because I want to be part of the development of this area.

472
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,178
[SPEAKER_24]: What I do want is a lower building.

473
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,380
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's our biggest concern.

474
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,962
[SPEAKER_24]: And we will address a few things later on if we're given that opportunity.

475
00:36:14,142 --> 00:36:14,442
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

476
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

477
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:23,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address of the record, please.

478
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Margaret Chernobyl Chapley.

479
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:34,053
[SPEAKER_01]: My daughter, Jillian, spoke earlier, and I would agree that we are less, we're like 100 feet, 140 feet, and have not been notified.

480
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:38,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Only learned from a neighbor about the meeting when the Somerville meeting took place.

481
00:36:39,335 --> 00:36:46,597
[SPEAKER_01]: I had thought when I came the last week, it was so discouraging that I felt that us as citizens in Medford had nobody supporting us.

482
00:36:47,317 --> 00:36:48,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I really felt left out.

483
00:36:48,477 --> 00:36:51,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day I go to work, yeah, and I pay taxes,

484
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:56,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet I didn't feel that council were behind us or anybody was behind us.

485
00:36:56,334 --> 00:37:01,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad to hear today that people are, that you do understand what our feelings are.

486
00:37:01,717 --> 00:37:04,578
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's mainly the height, we want to inform, it's mainly the height.

487
00:37:08,281 --> 00:37:10,022
[SPEAKER_01]: Some part of it, it's in our neighborhood.

488
00:37:10,742 --> 00:37:14,284
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just want to, you know, take part in what is happening in our neighborhood.

489
00:37:14,824 --> 00:37:17,226
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do thank you for addressing these issues.

490
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:17,866
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

491
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:20,848
[SPEAKER_11]: There were several councils in attendance last week at the meeting.

492
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,450
[SPEAKER_01]: There were, but it just got out.

493
00:37:22,471 --> 00:37:23,851
[SPEAKER_01]: The zone was not hearing us.

494
00:37:23,871 --> 00:37:25,352
[SPEAKER_01]: They were not letting anybody speak.

495
00:37:25,652 --> 00:37:28,853
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just felt that we were not being represented.

496
00:37:35,216 --> 00:37:40,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

497
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:40,918
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor.

498
00:37:40,938 --> 00:37:41,618
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

499
00:37:41,638 --> 00:37:44,760
[SPEAKER_11]: 17 7 3 0 offered by Councilor Kern being resolved that the mayor

500
00:37:50,572 --> 00:38:00,394
[SPEAKER_11]: send a written request to the Zoning Board of Appeals requesting that residents be allowed to speak at the next meeting and every subsequent meeting to ask questions and state concerns.

501
00:38:00,454 --> 00:38:01,474
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

502
00:38:02,074 --> 00:38:03,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

503
00:38:03,595 --> 00:38:15,017
[SPEAKER_17]: I just think it would be great for the mayor to step it up and almost go on record stating what happened last week is not, um,

504
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,433
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not the way we want this city to be run.

505
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:34,557
[SPEAKER_17]: We want to make sure our boards and commissions listen to the people, allow them time and opportunity to voice their concerns, state their objections if they have them, state their approvals if they have them of certain projects that go on in this city.

506
00:38:35,057 --> 00:38:40,079
[SPEAKER_17]: And I request that she ask the Zoning Board of Appeals to allow

507
00:38:41,128 --> 00:38:46,793
[SPEAKER_17]: the residents to speak at their next meeting, which I believe is going to be held sometime in the beginning of November.

508
00:38:47,714 --> 00:38:59,843
[SPEAKER_17]: There was four or five of us Councilors there on Tuesday, and I all but pleaded, not for or against the project, just pleaded to allow the residents to have the ability to speak.

509
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:08,310
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's just a right of somebody that, as the woman just spoke, somebody who pays taxes, resides in this city, and is

510
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:11,874
[SPEAKER_17]: next to a development, she should have the right to voice her concerns.

511
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:19,575
[SPEAKER_17]: She probably would have talked for two minutes, listed a number of concerns, and moved on to the other nine people who wanted to speak on the project.

512
00:39:20,055 --> 00:39:35,018
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I understand people don't want to be at meetings late, but it's a right that a resident should have, so I request that the mayor voice her concern, not for or against the project, even the height of the project, nothing to influence the zoning board.

513
00:39:35,098 --> 00:39:37,619
[SPEAKER_17]: I just request that she go in support of

514
00:39:38,983 --> 00:39:42,625
[SPEAKER_17]: allowing our residents to speak when it's so necessary that they do so.

515
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,968
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would, um, move approval on this resolution and, um, roll call vote, please.

516
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,430
[SPEAKER_23]: Name and address for the record.

517
00:39:51,951 --> 00:39:54,492
[SPEAKER_23]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

518
00:39:54,952 --> 00:39:56,653
[SPEAKER_23]: I think all these meetings need to be taped.

519
00:39:56,874 --> 00:39:57,514
[SPEAKER_23]: They all need to be.

520
00:39:57,938 --> 00:40:00,380
[SPEAKER_23]: We're here in Alden Chambers, you've got the TV system.

521
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,644
[SPEAKER_23]: Why wasn't it taped on the TV in real time?

522
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:12,329
[SPEAKER_23]: Because when I do Facebook Live and it's in real time, people, residents can see it and come running down and fix their opinion.

523
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:16,452
[SPEAKER_23]: So totally, Breanna Lungo-Koehn is absolutely correct.

524
00:40:16,472 --> 00:40:21,296
[SPEAKER_23]: The councilor needs to have the mayor speak up on this.

525
00:40:21,496 --> 00:40:26,900
[SPEAKER_23]: I think every meeting, the Cemetery Commission, the Green Energy, Room 207 with the City Council,

526
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:29,884
[SPEAKER_23]: It all needs to be out there for transparency reasons.

527
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:35,985
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn, seconded by Councilor Falco.

528
00:40:36,426 --> 00:40:36,986
[SPEAKER_08]: All in favor?

529
00:40:37,106 --> 00:40:38,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Opposed?

530
00:40:39,026 --> 00:40:39,606
[SPEAKER_08]: The ayes have it.

531
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:41,427
[SPEAKER_08]: The motion is adopted.

532
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:45,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Paper 17-731 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

533
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:51,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Be resolved that the Medford City Council implement an ordinance immediately that requires all owners within 300 feet

534
00:40:52,464 --> 00:40:58,805
[SPEAKER_08]: of a proposed variance request, be provided notice of such request, and be provided the date and time of the hearing.

535
00:40:59,525 --> 00:41:03,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it further resolved that this notice be given by regular mail and robocall.

536
00:41:03,746 --> 00:41:04,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilwoman Locur.

537
00:41:05,466 --> 00:41:12,647
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Vice President Marx, President Caraviello.

538
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:20,029
[SPEAKER_17]: This is my last, I'm sorry, I just had a few things on tonight, but I, last week got to me, this 300 feet proposal,

539
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:27,765
[SPEAKER_17]: is something that I proposed back on August 16, 2016.

540
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:40,609
[SPEAKER_17]: I had, be it resolved that the council implement an ordinance that requires all owners within 300 feet of a proposed variance request be provided notice of such request and be provided the date of the hearing.

541
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:47,131
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it further resolved that this notice be given by regular mail and robocall and sent by the Secretary Board of Appeals.

542
00:41:47,731 --> 00:41:52,153
[SPEAKER_17]: That was August 16, 2016, about a year and almost three months ago.

543
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:56,449
[SPEAKER_17]: At that time, we had about nine or 10 residents speak on that.

544
00:41:56,769 --> 00:41:58,911
[SPEAKER_17]: From what I recall, all in support.

545
00:41:59,731 --> 00:42:03,074
[SPEAKER_17]: It was amended that the city solicit a draft and ordinance.

546
00:42:04,135 --> 00:42:08,618
[SPEAKER_17]: It was amended that the Board of Appeals incorporate this into the rules and regulations and policies.

547
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:20,407
[SPEAKER_17]: It was sent to the zoning subcommittee on zoning and ordinances rather than implement it at the time, which I thank the clerk for pulling this for me.

548
00:42:22,744 --> 00:42:30,709
[SPEAKER_17]: I did a little investigating and found that it was discussed at the zoning meeting that I wasn't able to attend and left in committee.

549
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:34,731
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a year and three months ago, and it was left in committee.

550
00:42:35,111 --> 00:42:38,373
[SPEAKER_17]: So tonight, again, I'm asking that it not go into committee.

551
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:46,378
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm asking, whether it be 300, 400, 500 feet, that everybody within that radius be notified of these meetings.

552
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:52,221
[SPEAKER_17]: It will clear up so much confusion and prevent what happened last week twofold.

553
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:55,445
[SPEAKER_17]: because it's happening far too often.

554
00:42:55,465 --> 00:43:01,126
[SPEAKER_17]: And to have people that live across the street from proposed projects to not get notified is not right.

555
00:43:01,667 --> 00:43:05,707
[SPEAKER_17]: So I ask that this be an ordinance change, and it be changed immediately.

556
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:19,870
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how long it's gonna take our solicitor to draft an ordinance, but I ask that he, if that's what we wanna do, send it to the solicitor to make this and our prior resolution, put them both into an ordinance, that's fine.

557
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,910
[SPEAKER_17]: I just do not want it to go to committee.

558
00:43:22,486 --> 00:43:22,806
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

559
00:43:22,886 --> 00:43:32,491
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, council, Senator to the clerk for the correct, send it to the city solicitor for the correct language language.

560
00:43:32,851 --> 00:43:39,435
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, a request that it be done within 30 days so that we can take its first reading, um, by the end of November.

561
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:40,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

562
00:43:40,335 --> 00:43:40,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor knife.

563
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:42,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, yes, Mr. President.

564
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:50,260
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just taking a look at my notes here relative to the zoning subcommittee and that paper was kept in committee in a legal question was sent to the city solicitor at that time.

565
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:58,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, the legal question was, does the state law govern notice requirements and is this proposal outside of the scope of local control or is this a minimum guideline and we can build upon it?

566
00:43:59,076 --> 00:44:00,837
[SPEAKER_14]: That was the question that was sent to the solicitor.

567
00:44:01,438 --> 00:44:02,298
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, two, six, 17.

568
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, did we get an answer?

569
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:06,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not believe we have.

570
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:06,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

571
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:19,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, um, on the motion by council local current that we send this to the city solicitor for an opinion, I'm sure we throw for a language and his guidance.

572
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,841
[SPEAKER_11]: and reply within 30 days.

573
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:27,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Vice President Marx.

574
00:44:29,286 --> 00:44:30,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I support this wholeheartedly.

575
00:44:31,107 --> 00:44:38,673
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just ask that when we do send it that I believe all correspondence should go certified mail, not regular mail.

576
00:44:39,673 --> 00:44:45,598
[SPEAKER_08]: That way we can ensure that residents at least get a copy of it, Mr. President.

577
00:44:46,238 --> 00:44:48,360
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'd like to see

578
00:44:49,527 --> 00:44:51,388
[SPEAKER_08]: a greater outreach of notification.

579
00:44:51,888 --> 00:45:05,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I know this, the 300 feet was a starting point, but, uh, I guess when we get the language back, we can discuss it further, but I'd like to see a, a greater, uh, um, circumference when it comes to notification.

580
00:45:06,674 --> 00:45:07,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

581
00:45:08,135 --> 00:45:08,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

582
00:45:09,936 --> 00:45:15,098
[SPEAKER_13]: I do, as I understand it correctly, Mr. President, I believe that the notice only goes to property owners and if there's a renter,

583
00:45:15,602 --> 00:45:17,244
[SPEAKER_13]: at the facility, they would not receive notice.

584
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:20,908
[SPEAKER_13]: It would go to the address of the property owner, not the person that resides at the place of the renter.

585
00:45:22,049 --> 00:45:24,472
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to see that change.

586
00:45:24,532 --> 00:45:27,155
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

587
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:29,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, roll call vote, please.

588
00:45:40,717 --> 00:45:41,397

[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to take papers under suspension in the hands of the clerk.

602
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:08,988
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe Councilor Monk has given us several things here from last week.

603
00:46:11,177 --> 00:46:13,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to take papers in the hands of the clerk, Mr. President.

[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Mox.

609
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:30,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

610
00:46:31,091 --> 00:46:40,037
[SPEAKER_08]: That streetlight has been out for some time now, and I would ask that the city immediately send out its new vendor, which handles all the streetlights in the community.

611
00:46:40,447 --> 00:46:41,648
[SPEAKER_08]: and the interest of public safety.

612
00:46:42,008 --> 00:46:42,368
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

613
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,310
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

614
00:46:45,831 --> 00:46:46,471
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

615
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:48,172
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

616
00:46:48,252 --> 00:47:05,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the part, the past, be it resolved that the past with an orange cone, post with an orange cone, attached, I can't read your writing, Vice President.

[SPEAKER_08]: It resolved that the post with the orange cone attack posing a trip and fall hazard outside of LaCasha bakery be reviewed by the DPW and electrical department in the interest of public safety.

618
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,321
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

619
00:47:42,842 --> 00:47:45,183
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, and that's eight years of non-school too.

620
00:47:45,203 --> 00:47:57,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, the motion by council box seconded by Mr. President, if I could just, if I could vice president box, uh, that, that particular post was removed, uh, from what I understand many months ago.

621
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:03,072
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, the city put an orange cone and attached it to, uh, the bottom of the post.

622
00:48:03,753 --> 00:48:05,073
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been like that for awhile.

623
00:48:05,754 --> 00:48:08,415
[SPEAKER_08]: And when people come out of the cautious bakery holding their, uh,

624
00:48:08,939 --> 00:48:09,579
[SPEAKER_08]: tray of pizza.

625
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:14,723
[SPEAKER_08]: It's difficult to see that shot cone and, and, uh, it's a real trip and fall hazard.

626
00:48:15,023 --> 00:48:19,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would ask immediately in the interest of public safety, the city go out and rectify that issue.

627
00:48:19,106 --> 00:48:19,586
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

628
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:24,069
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Vice president on the motion by count by vice-president mark, seconded by councilor Dello Russo.

629
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:27,411
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor motion passes offered by vice-president marks.

630
00:48:27,872 --> 00:48:33,716
[SPEAKER_11]: We resolved that the sidewalk near little bakery on main street be reviewed in the interest of public safety.

631
00:48:34,316 --> 00:48:35,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice-president marks.

632
00:48:35,977 --> 00:48:36,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

633
00:48:37,218 --> 00:48:37,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

634
00:48:37,768 --> 00:48:42,753
[SPEAKER_08]: I think all of us behind this rail have traversed over that sidewalk at one point.

635
00:48:43,414 --> 00:48:53,845
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a tree that's probably 300 years old in front of the home and the sidewalk is literally up at a 90 degree angle because of the roots of the tree.

636
00:48:55,046 --> 00:48:56,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to see anything happen to the tree because

637
00:48:57,317 --> 00:49:09,487
[SPEAKER_08]: It's such a majestic old tree, but, uh, I think what we should do, Mr. President is remove the panel and, uh, put a task so, uh, people can traverse baby carriages can go over it.

638
00:49:10,127 --> 00:49:19,575
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, in the interest of public safety on the motion by vice-president Mark second and by councilor Dolo Russo, all those in favor motion passes often by vice-president Marks.

639
00:49:19,635 --> 00:49:22,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the trees on both street be trimmed.

640
00:49:22,277 --> 00:49:23,078
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice-president Marks.

641
00:49:23,891 --> 00:49:24,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

642
00:49:25,531 --> 00:49:38,454
[SPEAKER_08]: As you may or may not know, I'm not rather tall, but when you walk down Bow Street, your head hits the branches of the trees on Bow Street.

643
00:49:39,174 --> 00:49:40,954
[SPEAKER_08]: That's how low these branches are.

644
00:49:41,654 --> 00:49:47,695
[SPEAKER_08]: And the branches need to be trimmed, Mr. President, so residents can walk safely down the street.

645
00:49:48,095 --> 00:49:50,876
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would ask that the trees on Bow Street

646
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,722
[SPEAKER_08]: be trimmed in the interest of public safety, Mr. President.

647
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:56,865
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

648
00:49:57,565 --> 00:49:58,286
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

649
00:49:59,207 --> 00:50:00,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

650
00:50:00,367 --> 00:50:11,737
[SPEAKER_11]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the Traffic Commission review adding no parking signs from here to the corner of 3rd Street and Middlesex Avenue.

651
00:50:12,257 --> 00:50:13,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Mox.

652
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:15,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

653
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,283
[SPEAKER_08]: That 3rd Street and Middlesex Ave is a tough intersection with cars coming

654
00:50:19,855 --> 00:50:25,678
[SPEAKER_08]: out to take a left or right onto Middlesex Ave and cars park right to the intersection.

655
00:50:26,359 --> 00:50:32,902
[SPEAKER_08]: And it poses a real concern, not only for vehicles, but pedestrians that are crossing that particular intersection.

656
00:50:33,283 --> 00:50:42,468
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would ask on both sides of 3rd Street at Middlesex Ave that no parking here at a corner, signs be placed in the interest of public safety.

657
00:50:43,388 --> 00:50:46,690
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Marx, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

658
00:50:47,051 --> 00:50:47,751

00:50:48,531 --> 00:50:49,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

660
00:50:50,088 --> 00:51:00,124
[SPEAKER_11]: offered by Vice President Mox be it resolved that the City of DPW respond to why street sweeping is not taking place on Medford Street and Main Street around Higgins Avenue.

661
00:51:00,364 --> 00:51:01,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Mox.

662
00:51:02,047 --> 00:51:03,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

663
00:51:04,418 --> 00:51:20,953
[SPEAKER_08]: As we know, the City of Medford sweeps our main thoroughfares and this particular section of Medford on Medford Street and Main Street, right near Higgins Ave, has not been swept in some time or not on a regular basis like it should be.

664
00:51:21,573 --> 00:51:31,302
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would ask that DPW make sure that this portion of the city is on the street sweeping list and get done properly, Mr. President.

665
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,983
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Marx, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

666
00:51:35,063 --> 00:51:35,723
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

667
00:51:37,685 --> 00:51:38,525
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

668
00:51:38,605 --> 00:51:47,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Offered by Vice President Marx, be it resolved that the pedestrian crossing light on the east side of the Fellsway at 4th Street be repaired in the interest of public safety.

669
00:51:47,392 --> 00:51:48,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Marx.

670
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:50,214
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

671
00:51:50,334 --> 00:51:57,219
[SPEAKER_08]: When you're on the west side of the Fellsway and wanting to cross over to get to the side where Stop and Shop is, there's a pedestrian crossing light.

672
00:51:57,579 --> 00:51:59,821
[SPEAKER_08]: As we know, you have to cross two lanes of the Fellsway.

673
00:52:00,306 --> 00:52:01,509
[SPEAKER_08]: And that'll get you across.

674
00:52:01,929 --> 00:52:05,717
[SPEAKER_08]: The only problem is coming back, there's no pedestrian cross light that's working.

675
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:07,882
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can't get back, more or less.

676
00:52:07,902 --> 00:52:09,626
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very difficult to get back.

677
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:11,630
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would ask, Mr. President, that

678
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:20,118
[SPEAKER_08]: the pedestrian cross light on the east side of 4th Street be repaired in the interest of public safety.

679
00:52:20,739 --> 00:52:23,799
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

680
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:24,519
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

681
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:26,079
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

682
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:38,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the Traffic Commission review ways of reducing the amount of cut-through track traffic on College Ave from Summer Street to George Street in the interest of public safety.

683
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,662
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Mox.

684
00:52:40,775 --> 00:52:46,177
[SPEAKER_08]: If anyone's aware, that's a two-way road, and you can barely get a car down a two-way road.

685
00:52:46,937 --> 00:52:59,542
[SPEAKER_08]: And in certain peak times, it creates a lot of chaos and backup and is a very dangerous situation for those living on Summer College and George Street, Mr. President.

686
00:52:59,862 --> 00:53:06,704
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would ask that the Traffic Commission review the College Ave from Summer Street to George Street section

687
00:53:07,148 --> 00:53:23,363
[SPEAKER_08]: to come up with ways of improving the pedestrian safety and resident safety in the area, and to take a look at possibly, Mr. President, making it so that cars do not use it as a cut-through, maybe resident-only signs.

688
00:53:23,824 --> 00:53:28,108
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure, but the Traffic Commission needs to review the situation, Mr. President.

689
00:53:28,468 --> 00:53:31,431
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Marx, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

690
00:53:31,491 --> 00:53:32,092

692

693
00:53:40,856 --> 00:53:41,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Mox.

694
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:45,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just ask that DPW, Mr. President, go out to that sidewalk.

695
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:51,680
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a real trip and hazard concern and that it be repaired and replaced in the interest of public safety.

696
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

697
00:53:52,241 --> 00:53:55,562
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

698
00:53:55,602 --> 00:53:56,222
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

699
00:53:56,242 --> 00:53:57,123
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

700
00:53:57,143 --> 00:53:57,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

701
00:53:59,051 --> 00:54:08,636
[SPEAKER_11]: Offered by vice-president Marks, we have resolved that additional traffic enforcement at the corner of 2nd Street and Middlesex Avenue be reduced due to cars failing to stop.

702
00:54:08,696 --> 00:54:10,677
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice-president Marks?

703
00:54:10,757 --> 00:54:17,620
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a set of lights, Mr. President, at the corner of 2nd Street and Middlesex Ave.

704
00:54:18,332 --> 00:54:23,696
[SPEAKER_08]: And I heard from a number of residents that when the light turns red, they expect they can cross the street.

705
00:54:24,156 --> 00:54:35,264
[SPEAKER_08]: However, cars coming down Middlesex in particular from, uh, where Wendy's is, uh, coming down Middlesex, uh, to, um, Wellington circle, they're not stopping.

706
00:54:35,784 --> 00:54:37,025
[SPEAKER_08]: They're blowing right through the light.

707
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:44,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, it is a kind of a dead man's corner, uh, when you come around from BJ's, but there's ample time to see a red light.

708
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:47,792
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would ask that enforcement be stepped up in that area.

709
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:53,232
[SPEAKER_08]: to let drivers know that when the light turns red, they need to stop, Mr. President.

710
00:54:53,932 --> 00:54:56,833
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Mark, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

711
00:54:56,873 --> 00:54:57,453
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor.

712
00:54:57,473 --> 00:54:58,214
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

713
00:54:58,234 --> 00:54:59,074
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

714
00:54:59,214 --> 00:55:08,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Offered by Vice President Marks, be it resolved that the city administration report back on the status of the railroad tracks growing across Middlesex Avenue.

715
00:55:08,217 --> 00:55:09,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Marks.

716
00:55:09,737 --> 00:55:14,939
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a set of railroad tracks on Middlesex Avenue that's been defunct now for several years.

717
00:55:15,719 --> 00:55:18,720
[SPEAKER_08]: And a resident asked if there's anything can be done.

718
00:55:19,461 --> 00:55:20,601
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that's a state road.

719
00:55:21,041 --> 00:55:31,710
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would ask that this paper also be sent to a state delegation to see if we can remove the tracks, Mr. President, and pave over the street the way it really should exist.

720
00:55:33,391 --> 00:55:36,213
[SPEAKER_11]: The motion by Vice President Marx, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

721
00:55:36,734 --> 00:55:37,414
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

722
00:55:38,303 --> 00:55:39,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

723
00:55:39,104 --> 00:55:40,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Offered by vice president marks.

724
00:55:40,265 --> 00:55:46,730
[SPEAKER_11]: Be resolved that the construction in our Morrison street mangles taft and Gulch and Gil street be discussed.

725
00:55:47,171 --> 00:55:48,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice president marks.

726
00:55:48,932 --> 00:55:49,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

727
00:55:49,853 --> 00:55:50,574
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

728
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:54,257
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of these things were on last week and they weren't taken up last week.

729
00:55:54,297 --> 00:55:59,641
[SPEAKER_08]: So I didn't want to, uh, you know, have this all on the agenda, but, uh, this is stuff from last week also.

730
00:56:00,342 --> 00:56:05,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I received an email from a resident that was very concerned.

731
00:56:05,366 --> 00:56:05,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, she was,

732
00:56:07,118 --> 00:56:28,886
[SPEAKER_08]: contacted by a private company that's doing business with the city, CRL, and they asked that if they could set up an appointment to gain access to her basement and around her house so they could videotape based on some work that's being done on Taft and Guild Street.

733
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:34,508
[SPEAKER_08]: The same type of work was done on Morrison and Mangels and is still in process.

734
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:38,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I reached out today to the engineering department.

735
00:56:39,557 --> 00:56:43,967
[SPEAKER_08]: I spoke with Penny.

736
00:56:44,498 --> 00:56:45,839
[SPEAKER_08]: who was extremely helpful.

737
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:55,784
[SPEAKER_08]: She sent me a correspondence that was delivered to the homes of residents on Morrison Mangals, Tufts and Guild Street regarding the construction.

738
00:56:56,304 --> 00:57:03,888
[SPEAKER_08]: She also sent me a correspondence from Cassandra Kudalitis, the city engineer notice.

739
00:57:04,509 --> 00:57:10,452
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I could read it, Mr. President, because I think this is almost in the same way of

740
00:57:11,062 --> 00:57:16,447
[SPEAKER_08]: what we're experienced with notification with some of the zoning board and other projects that are going on in the city.

741
00:57:17,248 --> 00:57:27,918
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's extremely important that residents are aware of what's happening because according to this letter, if residents don't allow this particular construction company,

742
00:57:28,302 --> 00:57:45,608
[SPEAKER_08]: to gain access into their homes, then this letter states that they will have no other recourse when the hammering and construction takes place in the neighborhood to file a suit, which I don't think is legal anyways.

743
00:57:45,648 --> 00:57:49,149
[SPEAKER_08]: But if I could read the notice, I think it's important, Mr. President.

744
00:57:49,169 --> 00:57:53,450
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, Catch Basin Disconnection Project, North Medford.

745
00:57:53,991 --> 00:57:57,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Dear homeowner slash resident, the city has contracted with CRL,

746
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:02,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Incorporated for the upcoming drain main construction in your area.

747
00:58:03,573 --> 00:58:13,942
[SPEAKER_08]: During the project, CRL Incorporated will excavate Morrison Street, Mangle Street, Taft and Guild Streets to install drain main pipes and catch basins.

748
00:58:14,582 --> 00:58:18,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Please refer to the attached map for exact work limits.

749
00:58:18,766 --> 00:58:26,292
[SPEAKER_08]: The existing catch basins that are currently tied to the sewer system will be disconnected from the sewer system and connected to the new drain system.

750
00:58:26,915 --> 00:58:35,719
[SPEAKER_08]: This project is part of the city's efforts to remove INI inflow and infiltration, which I've been talking about for a hundred years, from the sewer system.

751
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:42,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Construction is expected to begin in early September and will be completed in approximately four months.

752
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:47,164
[SPEAKER_08]: The project will require rock removal that's present on site.

753
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:55,168
[SPEAKER_08]: The contractor will have to inspect the homes in the area to record their existing condition before the start of rock removal and construction.

754
00:58:55,715 --> 00:58:57,717
[SPEAKER_08]: please refer to the third page for details.

755
00:58:58,338 --> 00:59:02,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Another notice will be delivered later as we get closer to the start of the construction process.

756
00:59:03,103 --> 00:59:09,190
[SPEAKER_08]: During the construction process, signs will be posted on the affected streets with on-street parking restrictions.

757
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:13,295
[SPEAKER_08]: Detail officers will also be on site to assist with traffic management

758
00:59:13,763 --> 00:59:18,528
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions, you can call Penny in the engineering office at 781-475-5979.

759
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:33,283
[SPEAKER_08]: And the portion, Mr. President, that I want to also read was that this is the letter that went out to each home.

760
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:34,484
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't certified.

761
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:35,725
[SPEAKER_08]: The last letter was certified.

762
00:59:36,185 --> 00:59:37,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And a portion of this letter I'd like to read

763
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:55,216
[SPEAKER_08]: It says, also, please be aware that if you decide not to allow CRL and Corp to inspect and video both the interior and exterior of your home and property, you shall waive your rights to file any future claim for damage to your home and property in relation to this project.

764
00:59:56,677 --> 00:59:58,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think that's legal, Mr. President, first of all.

765
00:59:59,564 --> 01:00:09,852
[SPEAKER_08]: And secondly, if residents happen to not get notification, for whatever reason, we just had a major windstorm that was down trees and power lines.

766
01:00:09,892 --> 01:00:15,117
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's easy for a piece of paper like this that's attached to your door.

767
01:00:15,177 --> 01:00:20,641
[SPEAKER_08]: They told me they taped them on your door to easily fly off, you know, in a windstorm.

768
01:00:21,422 --> 01:00:27,927
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I would ask, Mr. President, that we — it also states that

769
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:31,923
[SPEAKER_08]: homes will be only inspected within 200 feet of the project.

770
01:00:32,443 --> 01:00:42,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you live 225 feet, they're not going to come out and inspect your, uh, your, uh, basement for any or the surrounding foundation for any type of damage.

771
01:00:42,428 --> 01:00:43,849
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's only within 200 feet.

772
01:00:44,389 --> 01:00:48,912
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would ask that, um, the city, Mr. President, uh, notify,

773
01:00:49,557 --> 01:00:55,962
[SPEAKER_08]: to reverse 911 in addition to possibly sending up a representative from the city.

774
01:00:56,523 --> 01:00:57,544
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only four streets.

775
01:00:57,964 --> 01:01:02,307
[SPEAKER_08]: To knock the doors, Mr. President, to let people know what's going on in the neighborhood.

776
01:01:02,728 --> 01:01:12,476
[SPEAKER_08]: From what I understand, the number that CRL put on this, if you have any questions or concerns, CRL said call us at 391-3800.

777
01:01:12,916 --> 01:01:15,939
[SPEAKER_08]: A resident called, no voicemail, couldn't leave a message.

778
01:01:16,279 --> 01:01:17,580
[SPEAKER_08]: It just rang and rang and rang.

779
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:22,902
[SPEAKER_08]: So we really need to have a clerk of the works representing the city when this project starts.

780
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:31,304
[SPEAKER_08]: In particular, when they start hammering the ledge, as we all know about Winthrop Street when they did blasting, it's going to create foundations to shake.

781
01:01:32,385 --> 01:01:34,366
[SPEAKER_08]: And people are going to be concerned, Mr. President.

782
01:01:34,966 --> 01:01:44,209
[SPEAKER_08]: And everyone in that community should be notified on those streets that they would be highly recommended to have someone come in and videotape to safeguard their home.

783
01:01:45,189 --> 01:01:47,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't think we're doing enough right now.

784
01:01:47,866 --> 01:01:52,489
[SPEAKER_08]: to get the message out to the community, uh, once again, regarding this very important project.

785
01:01:52,969 --> 01:02:14,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be my recommendation and my motion, uh, Mr. President, that, uh, a clerk of the works from the city engineering department, walk the streets, knock the doors, a reverse 911 be targeted for that particular neighborhood, uh, regarding what's taken place and contact names and numbers, uh, regarding what's happening, Mr. President, with this, uh, very important project.

786
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:16,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I do support the project.

787
01:02:17,178 --> 01:02:26,681
[SPEAKER_08]: as I've spoken timeless over the years, that we have a number of catch basins that are illegally hooked up to the sewer system.

788
01:02:27,261 --> 01:02:32,762
[SPEAKER_08]: And every time it rains, that water goes out and is treated at Deer Island as raw sewage.

789
01:02:33,103 --> 01:02:42,245
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's costing the rate payers of this community millions of dollars a year to treat rainwater from catch basins that are illegally connected to the sewer system.

790
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:45,466
[SPEAKER_08]: This will rectify that problem in that particular area.

791
01:02:45,882 --> 01:02:57,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So I thank the city for moving forward on this, but I want to make sure that, uh, the residents, uh, safeguarded Mr. President for any type of, uh, property loss or property destruction.

792
01:02:57,305 --> 01:02:57,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

793
01:02:58,206 --> 01:02:59,306
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Vice president.

794
01:02:59,686 --> 01:03:00,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

795
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:01,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

796
01:03:01,827 --> 01:03:03,267
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate my colleague for bringing this up.

797
01:03:03,687 --> 01:03:13,310
[SPEAKER_04]: If he doesn't mind, could we, could we amend that to maybe, um, I think it's such an important issue, especially when you're talking about, uh, jackhammering or maybe even worse,

798
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:22,968
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe that we should have the city engineer call for not only just going door to door, but then call for a community meeting for that area up in that, in that, that location.

799
01:03:23,028 --> 01:03:25,730
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can answer all the questions.

800
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:28,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going to be similar questions throughout all the residents.

801
01:03:29,271 --> 01:03:34,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And if my colleague doesn't, doesn't mind to add that on, I'd appreciate it.

802
01:03:37,835 --> 01:03:40,857
[SPEAKER_08]: President Mox, I think that's a great suggestion.

803
01:03:42,103 --> 01:03:52,571
[SPEAKER_08]: The correspondence I received, and I received a few from the city, one says that the utility project in your area is starting Thursday, November 2nd, which is two days away.

804
01:03:53,191 --> 01:03:58,896
[SPEAKER_08]: The other one says I'm taking a utility drain project starting the week of November 13th.

805
01:04:00,237 --> 01:04:03,680
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there was one other one.

806
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,603
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, the videotaping, November 2nd and 3rd.

807
01:04:09,084 --> 01:04:12,726
[SPEAKER_08]: and the 6th and the 10th, so November 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 10th.

808
01:04:13,426 --> 01:04:16,248
[SPEAKER_08]: Residents of Taft and Guild are being told 7 a.m.

809
01:04:16,348 --> 01:04:17,068
[SPEAKER_08]: to 11 a.m.

810
01:04:17,509 --> 01:04:19,450
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is really on the fast track now.

811
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:25,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't mind having a hearing, a public hearing, meeting, whatever, but someone needs to get out into the neighborhood.

812
01:04:25,973 --> 01:04:34,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, Mr. President, I received a complaint from Mangels that when they did this project, it rained and a lot

813
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:49,306
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have pictures that it turned their driveway, as you know, when concrete and water mix, it turned it a mixture of concrete and water and stuck to their driveway.

814
01:04:50,047 --> 01:04:57,392
[SPEAKER_08]: And they contacted the city and the city said, we'll have someone come out and power wash it, but we'll use your water.

815
01:04:58,152 --> 01:04:59,733
[SPEAKER_08]: And the resident took exception to that.

816
01:05:01,274 --> 01:05:02,215
[SPEAKER_08]: This is your problem.

817
01:05:02,955 --> 01:05:08,259
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess there was some back and forth on that, but I would also the paper, Mr. President city,

818
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:20,079
[SPEAKER_08]: go out to Mangels and look at the driveways to make sure that the cement that leached into the driveways is power washed off, Mr. President, no expense to the residents of that particular area.

819
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:29,987
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Knight as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Vice President Mox, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

820
01:05:30,507 --> 01:05:31,248
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

821
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:33,210
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

822
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:34,551
[SPEAKER_11]: Offered by Vice President Mox.

823
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:38,753
[SPEAKER_11]: resolve the rodent issue in Wellington being discussed.

824
01:05:39,414 --> 01:05:40,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Mox.

825
01:05:41,275 --> 01:05:42,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

826
01:05:43,377 --> 01:05:52,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I brought this up two weeks ago regarding a complaint I received from up the heights of rats, up the heights in Wellington.

827
01:05:53,167 --> 01:05:58,332
[SPEAKER_08]: And I have to report back that Allison Conboy from

828
01:05:59,310 --> 01:06:03,192
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, the health office was out in both bullets.

829
01:06:03,332 --> 01:06:13,056
[SPEAKER_08]: From my understanding, uh, did mine active, uh, red, um, uh, thank you.

830
01:06:13,116 --> 01:06:13,756
[SPEAKER_08]: Rad Burrows.

831
01:06:14,356 --> 01:06:23,100
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, in some of the areas, Mr. President, um, I asked that, uh, two weeks ago that the city hire a pest control company.

832
01:06:23,885 --> 01:06:27,627
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been successful in other areas of the city, hiring an outside company.

833
01:06:28,007 --> 01:06:36,572
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the whereabouts, the capacity, the manpower to handle large neighborhoods to solve an issue like this.

834
01:06:37,332 --> 01:06:49,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Much of the Wellington area that's under construction, we're experiencing from the casino, which is along the river, and the rats are making their way down the tracks and on the river.

835
01:06:49,699 --> 01:06:52,821
[SPEAKER_08]: The bridge that we're building in Wellington,

836
01:06:53,508 --> 01:06:55,376
[SPEAKER_08]: is creating this infestation.

837
01:06:59,638 --> 01:07:12,684
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm hearing from residents, some residents are not closing their barrels, and the rats are actually jumping on the barrel and helping themselves to this food source, which doesn't help the situation either.

838
01:07:13,145 --> 01:07:21,209
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would request, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety and the fact that it's pretty rampant in the Wellington area.

839
01:07:21,229 --> 01:07:27,732
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been getting a lot of calls from Third Street, Middlesex Ave, Bradbury, all over Wellington.

840
01:07:28,432 --> 01:07:29,293
[SPEAKER_08]: regarding rats.

841
01:07:30,014 --> 01:07:31,476
[SPEAKER_08]: And these aren't two-legged rats.

842
01:07:31,516 --> 01:07:34,399
[SPEAKER_08]: These are four-legged rats that are running around.

843
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:39,804
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would ask, Mr. President, that we receive a report back on a plan of action.

844
01:07:40,797 --> 01:07:45,279
[SPEAKER_08]: because I've yet to, I asked two weeks ago, I've yet to hear about any plan of action by the city.

845
01:07:45,939 --> 01:07:53,602
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, I think notification should go out to all residents in these particular areas to advise them that there is a concern.

846
01:07:54,102 --> 01:08:01,425
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there happens to be an old vegetable garden from the summer, that's still around and there's some old tomatoes, you got to take away the food source.

847
01:08:02,045 --> 01:08:07,987
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're taking your barrel out, make sure your trash is squished all the way down and the lid is secure and tight on it.

848
01:08:08,562 --> 01:08:11,883
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe if we take away the food source, we can get these rats.

849
01:08:12,763 --> 01:08:21,766
[SPEAKER_08]: One resident mentioned to me that if you introduce skunks, they're a natural predator to the rat, and they'll do away with the rats.

850
01:08:22,546 --> 01:08:23,386
[SPEAKER_08]: But then you have skunks.

851
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:26,327
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not sure which one is better, to be honest with you.

852
01:08:30,146 --> 01:08:42,156
[SPEAKER_08]: The issue, Mr. President, is a very serious issue, and they're going to start leaving these boroughs in the cold weather and try to find their way into people's homes and basements and so forth, and garages.

853
01:08:42,876 --> 01:08:46,840
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is going to be a real serious issue if we don't get ahead of the curve.

854
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:53,145
[SPEAKER_08]: But off of those two motions, Mr. President, notification of residents on what's happening.

855
01:08:53,996 --> 01:09:01,319
[SPEAKER_08]: through verse 9-1-1 and any other notification process and a plan of action on how we're going to handle this particular problem.

856
01:09:01,599 --> 01:09:02,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

857
01:09:02,859 --> 01:09:03,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

858
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,840
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

859
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:11,602
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe my rodent complaint this week came from the South Medford area, but not necessarily rats.

860
01:09:11,842 --> 01:09:13,723
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you give a little more detail?

861
01:09:14,642 --> 01:09:17,045
[SPEAKER_17]: People listening can know exactly where this is.

862
01:09:17,165 --> 01:09:21,270
[SPEAKER_17]: Is this happening in the park, near the parks, near homes, in people's backyards?

863
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:23,433
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually the whole neighborhood.

864
01:09:23,553 --> 01:09:24,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

865
01:09:24,354 --> 01:09:25,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I've witnessed them myself.

866
01:09:26,656 --> 01:09:27,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Just run by.

867
01:09:27,778 --> 01:09:31,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Typically at night, but it's everywhere.

868
01:09:32,323 --> 01:09:33,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I was at Harris Park.

869
01:09:34,356 --> 01:09:39,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Last weekend, every resident that came out to talk, that was their number one complaint.

870
01:09:39,618 --> 01:09:43,820
[SPEAKER_08]: I was waiting to hear sidewalks and other issues, and it was the rat infestation.

871
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,241
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've never seen it like this in the particular area.

872
01:09:47,261 --> 01:09:59,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we have a number of food establishments that the Board of Health has been great to be on top of these particular food establishments and their disposal that are outside on the perimeter of the property.

873
01:10:00,967 --> 01:10:03,048
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an epidemic.

874
01:10:03,695 --> 01:10:12,833
[SPEAKER_08]: In my opinion, Mr. President, and we need outside pest control to step up and come into the city, Mr. President, and try to alleviate.

875
01:10:13,114 --> 01:10:14,637
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's throughout the entire neighborhood.

876
01:10:14,978 --> 01:10:15,518
[SPEAKER_17]: of Wellington.

877
01:10:15,558 --> 01:10:17,359
[SPEAKER_17]: And then you said North Medford as well.

878
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:18,740
[SPEAKER_08]: At the top of North Medford.

879
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:25,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I received complaints, uh, right around car park, uh, from residents up there that said they've been seeing an increase.

880
01:10:25,524 --> 01:10:35,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't received as many calls to be honest with you from the Heights as I have from the Wellington area, but I received the same type of complaints regarding infestation, um, up in the Heights too.

881
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:36,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

882
01:10:36,130 --> 01:10:36,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Vice president.

883
01:10:37,911 --> 01:10:38,672
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

884
01:10:38,892 --> 01:10:39,152
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

885
01:10:39,212 --> 01:10:42,354
[SPEAKER_17]: I second the motion to the motion by vice president marks.

886
01:10:42,454 --> 01:10:43,295
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by council.

887
01:10:44,342 --> 01:10:45,103
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

888
01:10:45,923 --> 01:10:46,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

889
01:10:47,225 --> 01:10:49,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

890
01:10:49,367 --> 01:11:02,618
[SPEAKER_11]: 17-732 petition by Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, Medford to discuss, to address the council on zoning board of appeals meeting held on Tuesday, October 24th, 2017.

891
01:11:02,678 --> 01:11:03,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address for the record, please.

892
01:11:04,569 --> 01:11:07,112
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez from 281 Park Street.

893
01:11:08,214 --> 01:11:11,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks to everyone who was waiting to speak on this that stuck around.

894
01:11:12,759 --> 01:11:16,164
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted to talk about the Zoning Board meeting that happened on Tuesday, October 24th.

895
01:11:16,304 --> 01:11:19,909
[SPEAKER_12]: It was actually a continuation of the meeting that happened on September 26th.

896
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:35,912
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's important to note that it was a continuation from that date There was a City Council meeting on that date that was held at the Medford High School So anyone who had business with City Council or city councilors were unable to attend that meeting so

897
01:11:37,147 --> 01:11:46,571
[SPEAKER_12]: A Somerville alderman, I'm going to ruin this name, but Nader Gang was there and he requested that the hearing be postponed so that his constituents could be informed.

898
01:11:47,452 --> 01:11:59,177
[SPEAKER_12]: I heard through the grapevine that there was a meeting being held by this alderman, which was also on the night of a city council meeting, but he's from Somerville, so he's under no obligation to meet around you.

899
01:12:00,078 --> 01:12:01,178
[SPEAKER_12]: I attended that meeting.

900
01:12:01,238 --> 01:12:04,059
[SPEAKER_12]: There were about a hundred people in attendance at that meeting.

901
01:12:07,232 --> 01:12:12,457
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of concerns were brought up that I didn't think were mentioned at the October meeting.

902
01:12:12,557 --> 01:12:23,488
[SPEAKER_12]: Since only the elected officials were able to speak, we entrusted the sum of all the men to give us the information that transpired at that meeting, and we didn't hear from that.

903
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:33,349
[SPEAKER_12]: The biggest thing that the people were talking about is that we want open and transparent government, and the number one way for us to get that is to have open meetings with public participation.

904
01:12:33,989 --> 01:12:35,870
[SPEAKER_12]: When the meeting started, we were in the room.

905
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:36,830
[SPEAKER_12]: I was in the front row.

906
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:37,670
[SPEAKER_12]: The room was filled.

907
01:12:37,710 --> 01:12:39,390
[SPEAKER_12]: There were at least 20 people in the hallway.

908
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:40,371
[SPEAKER_12]: The room was too small.

909
01:12:40,851 --> 01:12:45,952
[SPEAKER_12]: City councilors came in and advised that the chambers were available and that we could move the meeting to that room.

910
01:12:46,652 --> 01:12:50,634
[SPEAKER_12]: The chairman at that point said that he was very comfortable where he was, didn't want to move.

911
01:12:51,094 --> 01:12:54,075
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a lot of dissent in the room at that point.

912
01:12:54,715 --> 01:13:02,318
[SPEAKER_12]: I said, gee, it seems like if a bigger room is available, it may be a violation to deny people the opportunity to be present for a meeting.

913
01:13:02,877 --> 01:13:04,318
[SPEAKER_12]: that they have concerns for.

914
01:13:04,918 --> 01:13:06,859
[SPEAKER_12]: That meeting was then moved into this room.

915
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:15,284
[SPEAKER_12]: All of the props that were shown were facing away from the audience, the people in the gallery.

916
01:13:15,844 --> 01:13:22,628
[SPEAKER_12]: The Somerville alderman spoke and said that $33,000 in traffic mitigation had been offered to Somerville.

917
01:13:23,789 --> 01:13:27,392
[SPEAKER_12]: But he didn't mention that there were a lot of issues about parking in Somerville.

918
01:13:27,412 --> 01:13:35,460
[SPEAKER_12]: The plan that we presented in Somerville was that overflow parking would be in a public parking lot that was across the street from the development.

919
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:42,086
[SPEAKER_12]: And many of the Somerville neighbors were upset because when they have the snow emergency parking, they rely on that parking.

920
01:13:42,466 --> 01:13:48,867
[SPEAKER_12]: And they felt that 10 guest spots that also combined as commercial spots were not sufficient and would give them issues.

921
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:54,869
[SPEAKER_12]: There were also issues from Somerville and Medford residents that that area frequently floods when it rains.

922
01:13:56,549 --> 01:13:59,790
[SPEAKER_12]: There was nothing brought up about that being changed.

923
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:08,752
[SPEAKER_12]: And when asked about loss of water pressure, about strains on utilities, we were told that that was okay because they were gonna hook into Medford.

924
01:14:09,916 --> 01:14:17,102
[SPEAKER_12]: When they asked about the front door being located on the Broadway side Because they were concerned about ubers backing up.

925
01:14:17,582 --> 01:14:33,675
[SPEAKER_12]: He said that if he had a hard time getting that variance He would just go with the Medford board because the Medford boards easier to get variances through The general tone of the meeting was that he was doing his best to conform with the Somerville zoning but as we've seen in many of the meetings Medford zoning is very flexible and

926
01:14:34,049 --> 01:14:43,781
[SPEAKER_12]: Although it's not supposed to be, because we're under the Massachusetts general law, 40A, section 10, entitled variances, that the reason for variances to be granted are very strict.

927
01:14:44,182 --> 01:14:48,707
[SPEAKER_12]: And none of them are that the piece of land is too small for me to build the project that I want.

928
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:56,325
[SPEAKER_12]: I also felt that when I looked at the paperwork for this project, they seemed to be assuming a use variance.

929
01:14:56,405 --> 01:14:58,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Rather than asking for a use variance, they're assuming one.

930
01:14:59,087 --> 01:15:01,428
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a general residence commercial one area.

931
01:15:02,349 --> 01:15:10,935
[SPEAKER_12]: In a commercial one area, you are allowed to build residences, but this is a mixed use building, which means that they're combining residences and commercial.

932
01:15:11,736 --> 01:15:15,818
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's a mixed use, which is a special permit that I didn't feel that they were applying for.

933
01:15:15,898 --> 01:15:18,000
[SPEAKER_12]: When I asked that, they said, no, no, it's not.

934
01:15:19,083 --> 01:15:23,725
[SPEAKER_12]: But when you look at the project you can clearly see that this is not two separate buildings.

935
01:15:24,105 --> 01:15:26,406
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one building So I'm concerned about that.

936
01:15:26,886 --> 01:15:35,709
[SPEAKER_12]: I was also concerned that when the meeting start after our elected officials spoke The chairman asked if there were any residents who wanted to speak in opposition to the project.

937
01:15:36,289 --> 01:15:38,110
[SPEAKER_12]: He said let the record reflect that ten

938
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:41,392
[SPEAKER_12]: residents would like to speak in opposition of the project.

939
01:15:41,832 --> 01:15:45,314
[SPEAKER_12]: At no point did he ask if anyone wanted to speak in favor of the project.

940
01:15:45,714 --> 01:15:48,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Perhaps there were another 10 or 20 that wanted to speak in favor.

941
01:15:48,276 --> 01:15:53,319
[SPEAKER_12]: They also were not given the opportunity to speak in this open and public meeting.

942
01:15:56,081 --> 01:15:57,461
[SPEAKER_12]: The meeting was not recorded.

943
01:15:57,842 --> 01:16:01,124
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently the recording device is not working.

944
01:16:02,312 --> 01:16:11,540
[SPEAKER_12]: They did say that we could speak if we didn't speak on zoning, parking, density, height, use, traffic, infrastructure, among other items, which precluded any resident from speaking.

945
01:16:12,641 --> 01:16:19,447
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not even sure we could comment on the color of the building because everything on that list we were not allowed to speak on.

946
01:16:20,228 --> 01:16:25,412
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a certain level of complaint from all of us that we were not able to attend the Somerville meeting.

947
01:16:25,472 --> 01:16:26,913
[SPEAKER_12]: People were not notified of the meeting.

948
01:16:27,313 --> 01:16:31,016
[SPEAKER_12]: We kept being told to come back last September, which is an impossibility.

949
01:16:31,396 --> 01:16:32,297
[SPEAKER_12]: That meeting was missed.

950
01:16:32,357 --> 01:16:38,782
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason that the hearing was held over was so that the residents could get more information.

951
01:16:38,822 --> 01:16:44,286
[SPEAKER_12]: And I thank the Somerville Aldermen for proposing that because our own Councilors were unavailable to do that.

952
01:16:44,926 --> 01:16:47,068
[SPEAKER_12]: But then we were not given the opportunity to speak.

953
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:56,302
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the other alarming things that happened was one of the Zoning Board members addressed the City Councilors in attendance.

954
01:16:56,382 --> 01:17:04,266
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that you touched on this a little bit earlier, but she said that the reason they were granting this number of variances is because our City Council hasn't updated the zoning.

955
01:17:04,947 --> 01:17:11,691
[SPEAKER_12]: While it's true that you haven't updated the zoning, it is not in the purview of the Zoning Board of Appeals to change the zoning.

956
01:17:12,011 --> 01:17:16,133
[SPEAKER_12]: They are only allowed to grant variances under the strict rules of Chapter 48, Section 10.

957
01:17:17,625 --> 01:17:29,794
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that they should all be made to review that ordinance, that law, it's a state law, and figure out what they're supposed to be doing because they're not doing this properly.

958
01:17:30,134 --> 01:17:33,877
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the only remedy that's going to work is for this hearing to be heard again.

959
01:17:34,838 --> 01:17:36,199
[SPEAKER_12]: We should be able to have the

960
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:40,432
[SPEAKER_12]: The project presented to us because we did not get the full presentation.

961
01:17:40,852 --> 01:17:44,874
[SPEAKER_12]: People should be able to speak in favor, and people should be able to speak in opposition.

962
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:51,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Because while the project may be great, we have no idea because we weren't given the opportunity to hear it.

963
01:17:52,217 --> 01:17:55,198
[SPEAKER_12]: We weren't given the opportunity to speak in opposition or in favor.

964
01:17:55,879 --> 01:18:00,941
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to say that zoning is our most important thing, and we need to protect our neighborhoods.

965
01:18:01,381 --> 01:18:04,503
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that you should definitely use the reverse 911 system for this.

966
01:18:04,563 --> 01:18:05,363
[SPEAKER_12]: If I can get a call,

967
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:09,526
[SPEAKER_12]: for the drug take-back, if I can get a call for the Harvester Energy Festival.

968
01:18:09,987 --> 01:18:15,972
[SPEAKER_12]: There's no reason that I can't get a call once a month that says there's a project on here that's 55 units.

969
01:18:16,052 --> 01:18:19,555
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're interested, please come to this meeting on such and such a date and time.

970
01:18:20,315 --> 01:18:20,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

971
01:18:20,656 --> 01:18:27,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and address of the record, please.

972
01:18:27,421 --> 01:18:31,465
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Saga's party.

973
01:18:32,095 --> 01:18:37,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to piggyback on what Cheryl talked about, but I'm more to the process more than anything else.

974
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:42,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this was a, the September meeting of the board of appeals was continued to the October meeting.

975
01:18:42,744 --> 01:18:52,012
[SPEAKER_03]: And once the meeting was continued to the October meeting, um, it was noticed out that the some of all Alderman didn't have enough time, um, to prepare what he needed to prepare.

976
01:18:52,032 --> 01:19:00,259
[SPEAKER_03]: So he wanted to be allowed to speak in the October meeting for which he was, I believe four of members of the council were there, expressed their opinion that the members, uh,

977
01:19:00,731 --> 01:19:10,099
[SPEAKER_03]: They had received emails and telephone calls regarding folks that weren't notified, did not get the notice, and they just heard about it on this particular night, and they rushed down there to come to this October meeting.

978
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:21,468
[SPEAKER_03]: It was at the discretion of the chairman of the board, Mr. Carman, who indicated that public comment was closed because the September meeting had come and gone.

979
01:19:22,029 --> 01:19:26,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that's not particularly correct either.

980
01:19:26,613 --> 01:19:29,295
[SPEAKER_03]: The meeting was continued, and when the meeting was continued,

981
01:19:29,911 --> 01:19:44,459
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time when the chairman asked for a raise of hands, those who might be opposed, and I believe he said, let the record say there were 10, at that point he opened up that meeting for public participation by the raise of the hands, because he noticed it out.

982
01:19:44,739 --> 01:19:46,160
[SPEAKER_03]: He also said that they couldn't speak.

983
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:56,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you're asking for their participation by raising their hands, but they couldn't speak, you really don't know the reason why they were opposing it, because maybe they would have been convinced

984
01:19:57,814 --> 01:20:03,000
[SPEAKER_03]: that they would be far if they wanted to get their particular point across, which unfortunately I never had.

985
01:20:03,641 --> 01:20:11,289
[SPEAKER_03]: So then you go to four particular issues that I think were really prevalent at that particular meeting.

986
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:12,891
[SPEAKER_03]: The first one was

987
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:17,565
[SPEAKER_03]: The zoning on parking spaces, Somerville and Medford are very different.

988
01:20:17,665 --> 01:20:21,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Somerville has 1.0 per parking unit, Medford has 2.1.

989
01:20:22,127 --> 01:20:23,507
[SPEAKER_03]: No discussion on that at all.

990
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:30,330
[SPEAKER_03]: The next issue was the sun being blocked on the streets that are abutting this particular project.

991
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:31,551
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a legitimate concern.

992
01:20:31,571 --> 01:20:33,912
[SPEAKER_03]: You have the same issue here on High Street.

993
01:20:34,738 --> 01:20:36,619
[SPEAKER_03]: when they were building the new condominiums next to St.

994
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:37,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Joseph's Church.

995
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:40,040
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's legal cases and legal precedent.

996
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:52,763
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone's sunlight is being blocked by a building, and in this particular case, you're asking for variances to a particular project, which is over and beyond just a normal building, that has legal precedence.

997
01:20:53,563 --> 01:21:02,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, they didn't talk about the fact that Cheryl alluded to the facts on this mixed-use piece of property that could be put together.

998
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:05,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, in the city of Medford, we do not allow for spot zoning.

999
01:21:06,211 --> 01:21:12,932
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the arguments that's taking place on Locust Street right now, the argument of a possible spot zoning issue.

1000
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:18,894
[SPEAKER_03]: That didn't even have an opportunity for public discussion as it relates to the fact that, you know, is it or isn't it?

1001
01:21:19,434 --> 01:21:31,697
[SPEAKER_03]: So the mixed use combination of mixed use of commercial and residential, beside not having its opportunity to have a conversation, did not even have its opportunity for the Board of Appeals to say, if we're going to entertain that,

1002
01:21:32,037 --> 01:21:42,740
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's obvious that it's a mixed zone, I mean, it's a spot zone issue, which is in violation of the law or the spirit of, not the spirit, of the Massachusetts general law here in the city of Medford that's promulgated.

1003
01:21:43,261 --> 01:21:46,642
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got an issue here as it relates to the developer and what he needs to do.

1004
01:21:47,382 --> 01:21:50,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Councilor Dello Russo alluded to the fact that the board is not political.

1005
01:21:50,923 --> 01:21:55,504
[SPEAKER_03]: It most certainly is political because all three members of the board are appointed by the mayor of this community.

1006
01:21:55,925 --> 01:22:00,286
[SPEAKER_03]: So the request that was just made earlier by Councilor Longo relative to asking the mayor

1007
01:22:01,493 --> 01:22:07,357
[SPEAKER_03]: to ask the board to let people speak on and beyond, over and beyond, is absolutely on target.

1008
01:22:08,017 --> 01:22:13,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And more importantly, you can say what you want about the prior Board of Appeals when Mr. Arena was the chairperson.

1009
01:22:13,421 --> 01:22:27,851
[SPEAKER_03]: He always allowed every single person to speak, never mind once, sometimes twice, because he recognized whether you agreed or disagreed with his decision, if people took the time to be there and have a conversation about the project that's before them, then let them speak.

1010
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:29,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was not the situation.

1011
01:22:31,093 --> 01:22:39,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost had the distinct honor of having the police called on me by the chairperson, because I asked him, and I begged him three separate times, would you please let the people speak?

1012
01:22:39,898 --> 01:22:42,739
[SPEAKER_03]: And he says, no, no, he can't, because the time has already come.

1013
01:22:42,759 --> 01:22:43,880
[SPEAKER_03]: We've already had it in September.

1014
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:51,123
[SPEAKER_03]: And through his reckless act, and that's what I call it, reckless, he canceled the whole meeting, which was the last two petitioners that were on there.

1015
01:22:51,483 --> 01:22:53,144
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't even have an opportunity to speak.

1016
01:22:54,025 --> 01:22:58,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the law is somewhat clear, but it's also somewhat fuzzy.

1017
01:22:59,647 --> 01:23:11,014
[SPEAKER_03]: In the open meeting law, in the guidelines promulgated by the Attorney General, it does say, it does give the distinction to the chairperson or the chair of the committee to allow people to speak at that person's discretion.

1018
01:23:11,535 --> 01:23:21,301
[SPEAKER_03]: But it also says at the very end by the Attorney General, the Attorney General encourages public bodies to allow as much public participation as time allows.

1019
01:23:21,661 --> 01:23:23,082
[SPEAKER_03]: This was eight o'clock at night.

1020
01:23:23,482 --> 01:23:25,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody was falling asleep in this audience.

1021
01:23:25,724 --> 01:23:27,805
[SPEAKER_03]: They were here because for a particular purpose.

1022
01:23:29,114 --> 01:23:31,196
[SPEAKER_03]: as much public participation as possible.

1023
01:23:31,556 --> 01:23:38,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And for that chairperson to shut off public participation and hear what was on people's minds was wrong.

1024
01:23:38,864 --> 01:23:53,077
[SPEAKER_03]: This same chairperson served as an alternate last year when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Attorney General Office came in and told the Board of Appeals that they had to reopen the board because they were wrong in closing down a meeting that was in a continued meeting.

1025
01:23:54,089 --> 01:24:02,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if this Board of Appeals doesn't want to understand the law and follow the guidelines by the State's Attorney General, then maybe we need a new board.

1026
01:24:02,615 --> 01:24:08,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe when you change the charter, we should have the Board of Appeals be elected instead of appointed that way there.

1027
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:09,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that would be the safest way.

1028
01:24:10,521 --> 01:24:13,683
[SPEAKER_03]: Neighborhood character and neighborhood future buildings be protected.

1029
01:24:14,363 --> 01:24:14,584
[SPEAKER_03]: You know,

1030
01:24:15,585 --> 01:24:20,288
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys and ladies on this council, your biggest responsibility over the budget is zoning.

1031
01:24:20,628 --> 01:24:23,189
[SPEAKER_03]: What takes place in a community by its zoning?

1032
01:24:23,769 --> 01:24:29,372
[SPEAKER_03]: You can talk about it all you want, you can advertise it all you want, but people are saying nothing's taking place.

1033
01:24:29,392 --> 01:24:30,613
[SPEAKER_03]: This community has changed.

1034
01:24:30,973 --> 01:24:35,796
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in the middle of a lawsuit, they're suing the developer on Locust Street in Medford.

1035
01:24:36,136 --> 01:24:42,378
[SPEAKER_03]: You've gone to Miloka Street, you've gone to Middlesex Avenue, you've gone to Salem Street, and now you're over here in South Medford on Medford Street.

1036
01:24:42,959 --> 01:24:51,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the other arguments that were brought forth is the traffic going to be deposited onto the Medford Street, and Medford Street, as we all know, is a cut-through street to Somerville.

1037
01:24:52,382 --> 01:24:54,123
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all legitimate concerns.

1038
01:24:54,783 --> 01:24:57,424
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't to say whether you're for or against the project.

1039
01:24:57,504 --> 01:25:00,585
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the concerns that the people wanted to talk about.

1040
01:25:01,265 --> 01:25:07,308
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you shut the people off at the pass, that's why they have no respect and they don't believe in their government.

1041
01:25:08,028 --> 01:25:10,429
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it's incumbent upon you as city councilors.

1042
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:14,230
[SPEAKER_03]: You've been talking about it for two years, about changing your zoning, and you haven't done it.

1043
01:25:14,690 --> 01:25:24,112
[SPEAKER_03]: So whoever of you get re-elected, you should make that your priority, along with the new members of the council, that zoning is the number one priority, because you've seen what it's doing to this community.

1044
01:25:24,332 --> 01:25:27,373
[SPEAKER_03]: You've seen the character of neighborhoods being totally disrupted.

1045
01:25:28,213 --> 01:25:35,639
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can't say it's not political when every member on the board is appointed by a political person, and that's the mayor of this community.

1046
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:48,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you want to have clean hands and let the neighborhood and let the taxpayers make that decision, because good zoning might be predicated upon people who get elected rather than people get appointed, that might set the tone in a different direction.

1047
01:25:49,651 --> 01:25:51,053
[SPEAKER_03]: And just lastly, I want to say this.

1048
01:25:52,374 --> 01:25:53,054
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Halloween.

1049
01:25:53,074 --> 01:25:54,055
[SPEAKER_03]: This is trick-or-treat night.

1050
01:25:54,636 --> 01:25:55,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of you have young children.

1051
01:25:56,416 --> 01:26:03,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would have been a good call by you, Mr. President, to delay the meeting by at least an hour to let whoever had children to go out and trick or treat with their family.

1052
01:26:04,184 --> 01:26:09,249
[SPEAKER_03]: You still could have accomplished the city council meeting and we wouldn't be in the chaos that we're in right now.

1053
01:26:09,389 --> 01:26:11,992
[SPEAKER_11]: We had a public hearing this night tonight that was already advertised.

1054
01:26:12,513 --> 01:26:12,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Pardon me?

1055
01:26:13,113 --> 01:26:16,917
[SPEAKER_11]: There was a public hearing that was already advertised prior to the request.

1056
01:26:16,997 --> 01:26:17,718
[SPEAKER_03]: And when was that, sir?

1057
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:21,942
[SPEAKER_11]: The clerk had already sent out the letters for that.

1058
01:26:22,202 --> 01:26:23,843
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe you have 48 hours to change that.

1059
01:26:24,083 --> 01:26:25,204
[SPEAKER_03]: You've had that since last week.

1060
01:26:25,784 --> 01:26:28,046
[SPEAKER_03]: But other than that, I'd be more than happy to answer any questions.

1061
01:26:28,066 --> 01:26:31,007
[SPEAKER_03]: But how do you say it?

1062
01:26:31,728 --> 01:26:36,490
[SPEAKER_03]: There aren't too many things that you guys and girls really have super control over.

1063
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:40,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Budget, voting it up and down, but zoning, it's all yours.

1064
01:26:40,313 --> 01:26:42,134
[SPEAKER_03]: You own it, lock, stock, and barrel.

1065
01:26:42,734 --> 01:26:43,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Use it.

1066
01:26:43,815 --> 01:26:45,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't let the administration abuse it.

1067
01:26:45,876 --> 01:26:47,457
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys and girls use it.

1068
01:26:48,148 --> 01:26:48,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1069
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:53,851
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

1070
01:26:53,871 --> 01:26:55,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address of the record, please.

1071
01:26:55,371 --> 01:26:58,893
[SPEAKER_18]: Tough to follow Joyce Paul, a Mason street.

1072
01:26:59,493 --> 01:27:06,516
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, I want to say that just as you are very busy, um, I'm busy and other people are busy.

1073
01:27:06,757 --> 01:27:11,719
[SPEAKER_18]: And I definitely think that the idea of a reverse call that Cheryl,

1074
01:27:12,271 --> 01:27:14,011
[SPEAKER_18]: brought up is a very good idea.

1075
01:27:14,031 --> 01:27:18,252
[SPEAKER_18]: It reminds people of the meeting and it tells people again where and when.

1076
01:27:19,013 --> 01:27:29,915
[SPEAKER_18]: And the second thing is, I totally, what I hear all the time is from people, they don't get to speak, they don't feel involved, and they want to feel involved.

1077
01:27:29,955 --> 01:27:34,076
[SPEAKER_18]: They want to be able to speak, they want to be able to talk to their neighbors and their

1078
01:27:35,138 --> 01:27:37,540
[SPEAKER_18]: and they feel like they haven't been able to do that.

1079
01:27:38,401 --> 01:27:45,847
[SPEAKER_18]: Um, and I know you've got a tough job, but it's really important that it would make people a lot happier.

1080
01:27:45,907 --> 01:27:49,029
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think things would flow a lot better if we could do that.

1081
01:27:49,170 --> 01:27:49,930
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you.

1082
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:50,531
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1083
01:27:53,653 --> 01:27:54,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

1084
01:27:54,054 --> 01:27:55,154
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

1085
01:27:56,135 --> 01:28:01,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Ray scaffold nine sunset F. I think, I think the problem is, is like Michael Mark said, is the notification.

1086
01:28:02,411 --> 01:28:03,992
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, it should go out certified mail.

1087
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:17,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, uh, and it should be the cost of the project person, uh, to, to pay for that, to go out because I own a piece of property in a different city and, uh, I had to notify my abutters, uh, on a project that I had to do.

1088
01:28:17,419 --> 01:28:28,344
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had to do it by certified mail, uh, as, so you'd get the list of, uh, uh, of the abutters from the city and, uh, you take that and you send out the certified letter.

1089
01:28:29,004 --> 01:28:30,125
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course they signed for it.

1090
01:28:30,552 --> 01:28:33,653
[SPEAKER_07]: And this way everybody's notified so we don't end up in a situation like this.

1091
01:28:33,993 --> 01:28:35,253
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes it just much more smooth.

1092
01:28:36,174 --> 01:28:36,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1093
01:28:36,434 --> 01:28:36,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1094
01:28:40,955 --> 01:28:41,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

1095
01:28:41,355 --> 01:28:42,296
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address of the record again.

1096
01:28:42,596 --> 01:28:44,376
[SPEAKER_24]: Pamela Cerullo five Shapely Avenue.

1097
01:28:44,396 --> 01:28:47,277
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to reiterate one thing.

1098
01:28:47,977 --> 01:28:57,420
[SPEAKER_24]: I never do this, but when something affects my quality of life as well as this building will, I had to speak.

1099
01:28:57,660 --> 01:28:59,641
[SPEAKER_24]: I had to say something and,

1100
01:29:00,272 --> 01:29:04,074
[SPEAKER_24]: Unfortunately, I was not notified about the first meeting, otherwise I would have been there.

1101
01:29:05,254 --> 01:29:15,099
[SPEAKER_24]: And it really hurt when Chairman Carmen made that comment about, well, you didn't make the meeting, whatever, that's your problem, pretty much.

1102
01:29:15,799 --> 01:29:18,660
[SPEAKER_24]: Had we been notified, we would have been there, okay?

1103
01:29:19,461 --> 01:29:28,045
[SPEAKER_24]: The other thing, too, I just have two questions that I would like to present, and hopefully maybe the developer or council can address this at some point.

1104
01:29:29,615 --> 01:29:32,617
[SPEAKER_24]: I was going through the paperwork for the building plans.

1105
01:29:33,017 --> 01:29:38,099
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't see anything from the Board of Health commenting on trash collection.

1106
01:29:38,299 --> 01:29:39,480
[SPEAKER_24]: Where is it going to be located?

1107
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:40,821
[SPEAKER_24]: Is it going to be on the Medford side?

1108
01:29:40,861 --> 01:29:42,021
[SPEAKER_24]: Is it going to be on the Somerville side?

1109
01:29:42,822 --> 01:29:44,583
[SPEAKER_24]: That's my first concern.

1110
01:29:45,143 --> 01:29:51,086
[SPEAKER_24]: And the second thing is, someone had mentioned about the shade, all right, the sunlight.

1111
01:29:51,746 --> 01:29:58,590
[SPEAKER_24]: Was a shade survey taken for our side of the street, for Medford Street, Somerville, you

1112
01:29:59,652 --> 01:30:01,053
[SPEAKER_24]: Shapely Avenue, Sunnyside Terrace.

1113
01:30:02,354 --> 01:30:06,317
[SPEAKER_24]: So these are the kind of things that we really wanted to just ask questions.

1114
01:30:06,897 --> 01:30:09,679
[SPEAKER_24]: Again, we're not against the redevelopment of the area.

1115
01:30:09,719 --> 01:30:14,162
[SPEAKER_24]: We just wanted to voice these concerns, get answers, and then we could, you know, say yay or nay.

1116
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:17,424
[SPEAKER_24]: So I just wanna let that out.

1117
01:30:17,524 --> 01:30:18,165
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you very much.

1118
01:30:18,185 --> 01:30:18,525
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1119
01:30:26,750 --> 01:30:28,332
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo,

1120
01:30:29,914 --> 01:30:34,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

1121
01:30:36,219 --> 01:30:36,539
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1122
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:38,240
[SPEAKER_17]: President Caraviello.

1123
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:43,864
[SPEAKER_17]: And I, I think there are still a number of questions that really aren't answered and the public don't know.

1124
01:30:43,884 --> 01:30:54,252
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if the administration or the council, I mean, it's really sad to ask the administration of the council to have a public meeting for the neighborhood, but

1125
01:30:55,213 --> 01:31:03,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, if the Board of Appeals are not going to allow the residents to speak, how are we going to solve this problem that we're in?

1126
01:31:03,778 --> 01:31:21,667
[SPEAKER_17]: In the last development that I was involved in with regards to the Salem Street area, residents were given the opportunity and after persistence from several Councilors, several residents, changes were made.

1127
01:31:21,707 --> 01:31:23,108
[SPEAKER_17]: There was a compromise made.

1128
01:31:23,535 --> 01:31:26,497
[SPEAKER_17]: It was brought down from five stories to three stories.

1129
01:31:27,078 --> 01:31:31,021
[SPEAKER_17]: The developer is moving forward and is going to, you know, make his profit.

1130
01:31:31,081 --> 01:31:34,804
[SPEAKER_17]: And it was tough to get it done.

1131
01:31:34,824 --> 01:31:39,928
[SPEAKER_17]: And the process is obviously not, wasn't ideal then.

1132
01:31:39,948 --> 01:31:42,810
[SPEAKER_17]: But it seems like it's even worse now.

1133
01:31:43,150 --> 01:31:52,097
[SPEAKER_17]: So whether it be the administration or the council, somebody needs, we have to have some sort of meeting between the neighbors and the development.

1134
01:31:53,454 --> 01:31:59,036
[SPEAKER_17]: developer to get some answers and to figure out how we can solve it and move on.

1135
01:31:59,636 --> 01:32:02,397
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it has to come from the administration.

1136
01:32:02,477 --> 01:32:05,238
[SPEAKER_17]: It has to be set up by the administration somehow, some way.

1137
01:32:05,658 --> 01:32:07,559
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just- Councilor, if I could.

1138
01:32:07,579 --> 01:32:11,320
[SPEAKER_11]: If you recall, the Salem Street people, the developers held several meetings on their own.

1139
01:32:11,980 --> 01:32:12,300
[SPEAKER_17]: They did.

1140
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:13,040
[SPEAKER_11]: If you recall.

1141
01:32:13,240 --> 01:32:13,541
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1142
01:32:13,581 --> 01:32:20,683
[SPEAKER_11]: They had two or three meetings with the neighbors during that, and I think that was a help.

1143
01:32:21,670 --> 01:32:45,256
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe so I'd ask that I'd ask the administration to organize some sort of meeting if it's not gonna be organized by the Petitioner then you know some meetings does need to be had the administration mayor of the city has to get involved this is something that is gonna affect so many people in that neighborhood and To for the Board of Appeals not to allow residents to speak again.

1144
01:32:45,276 --> 01:32:48,437
[SPEAKER_17]: It was said by many people tonight It's just wrong.

1145
01:32:48,537 --> 01:32:49,517
[SPEAKER_17]: It's it's wrong and it

1146
01:32:49,935 --> 01:32:56,398
[SPEAKER_17]: It's irked me for the last week, and I'm really surprised by the fact that they just weren't allowed to speak.

1147
01:32:56,478 --> 01:33:05,961
[SPEAKER_17]: They could have been for this proposal if they just got, the residents were just able to ask questions and get answers, and it really bothers me, and it's the way we don't operate.

1148
01:33:06,001 --> 01:33:13,204
[SPEAKER_17]: We allow people to speak here, thanks to you and the prior presidents since I've been on the council, and that's the way it should be.

1149
01:33:13,565 --> 01:33:19,587
[SPEAKER_17]: Whether you limit them for 10 minutes or whatever you have to do, but people should be given the opportunity to speak.

1150
01:33:20,073 --> 01:33:21,694
[SPEAKER_17]: And I too agree with the robo call.

1151
01:33:21,735 --> 01:33:24,597
[SPEAKER_17]: It was in one of my resolutions and Cheryl brought it up again tonight.

1152
01:33:24,657 --> 01:33:27,039
[SPEAKER_17]: And it, it's something that needs to be done.

1153
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:35,086
[SPEAKER_17]: We get notifications on everything from road races to harvest the end of tree festivals, all things we are involved in and want to be involved in.

1154
01:33:35,507 --> 01:33:42,573
[SPEAKER_17]: But to not get a robot, not even get notify the residents that live across the street on such a proposal is astounding.

1155
01:33:44,175 --> 01:33:44,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice president box.

1156
01:33:45,776 --> 01:33:46,717
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1157
01:33:47,215 --> 01:34:00,178
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll be brief, but if we could make part of the committee report, um, the, uh, question of, uh, trash collection and where the trash will be located, uh, on that particular site, that's important.

1158
01:34:00,758 --> 01:34:11,941
[SPEAKER_08]: And the shade study that was referred to, um, I attended a meeting with the Salem street project and the developer came out with, let me tell you a presentation that would,

1159
01:34:12,808 --> 01:34:29,859
[SPEAKER_08]: knock your socks off regarding that particular issue alone, the shade in the building actually was re, um, uh, designed, uh, for setbacks on the higher floors based on the proximity of the homes that are, but the property.

1160
01:34:30,319 --> 01:34:41,346
[SPEAKER_08]: So they wouldn't lose their shade and they had a timeline, uh, that was remarkable on how the sunlight comes in at certain times and so forth and how it wouldn't impact them.

1161
01:34:41,883 --> 01:34:43,304
[SPEAKER_08]: based on this particular study.

1162
01:34:43,964 --> 01:34:58,892
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that goes a long way to reassure neighbors that their quality of life, and sun is part of a quality of life, that the way that hits their home does have an impact on residents in the community.

1163
01:34:59,412 --> 01:35:04,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Another thing I brought up that night, Mr. President, is a little known fact, but the

1164
01:35:05,765 --> 01:35:11,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Zoning Board of Appeals gets all sorts of documentations that are submitted by the developer.

1165
01:35:11,911 --> 01:35:13,613
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them is a traffic impact study.

1166
01:35:14,133 --> 01:35:22,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that's done by the developers, uh, person that they hire, uh, their traffic, um, firm.

1167
01:35:23,022 --> 01:35:29,068
[SPEAKER_08]: And, uh, there's a state law that allows the Zoning Board of Appeals at the developer's expense,

1168
01:35:29,606 --> 01:35:33,167
[SPEAKER_08]: to request on behalf of the city, their own traffic study.

1169
01:35:33,647 --> 01:35:41,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Because as you know, you know, you could have like an expert in court, you have one doctor saying one thing and another doctor saying something else.

1170
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:46,152
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's important that when we have these particular projects,

1171
01:35:46,616 --> 01:36:06,115
[SPEAKER_08]: that the city not just go based on everything that's submitted by the developer, but do its own homework, its due diligence, and part of that is the traffic report, the traffic study, and I asked that Zoning Board of Appeals that night, Mr. President, if they would request that, and I don't know, I think they just took it under advisement.

1172
01:36:07,216 --> 01:36:07,917
[SPEAKER_08]: I really couldn't tell,

1173
01:36:09,175 --> 01:36:11,817
[SPEAKER_08]: but they seem to be interested in that fact.

1174
01:36:12,477 --> 01:36:28,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so I would ask also, uh, if there was a shade study done, Mr. President, as part of our report, we're putting together a report now, a report that's going to go back to the zoning board of appeals, uh, to ask question on trash collection.

1175
01:36:28,728 --> 01:36:30,930
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, what was just a resolution?

1176
01:36:32,286 --> 01:36:40,809
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever you wanna call it, resolution, report, whatever you wanna call it, but we're asking questions of the Zoning Board of Appeals regarding trash collection.

1177
01:36:41,209 --> 01:36:42,449
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have a resolution, Councilor Marksson.

1178
01:36:43,430 --> 01:36:49,391
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I put before we as the measure for community meeting with the development.

1179
01:36:49,411 --> 01:36:50,372
[SPEAKER_11]: We already passed that.

1180
01:36:50,392 --> 01:36:51,092
[SPEAKER_08]: We already passed that.

1181
01:36:51,112 --> 01:36:52,332
[SPEAKER_08]: So these are questions they can.

1182
01:36:52,953 --> 01:37:00,635
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, so I offer a motion then that we send a correspondence to the Zoning Board of Appeals regarding trash collection, which was brought up tonight,

1183
01:37:01,362 --> 01:37:15,213
[SPEAKER_08]: a shade study if one was done and why, if not, one was done and wasn't done, and a traffic impact study submitted on behalf of this city and not on behalf of the developer, Mr. President.

1184
01:37:17,302 --> 01:37:21,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Zamuto, I can only offer you some advice similar to other projects.

1185
01:37:22,065 --> 01:37:23,486
[SPEAKER_11]: You have a Sons of Bitly Hall up there.

1186
01:37:23,506 --> 01:37:37,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you could get the residents together on a Sunday evening and meet with them over coffee and hear their concerns and voice your concerns or put your opinion at that spot.

1187
01:37:37,988 --> 01:37:41,292
[SPEAKER_11]: My personal advice, I think, I say the people on Salem Street did it.

1188
01:37:41,332 --> 01:37:45,858
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it went a long way, got a lot of issues resolved, and that's my advice.

1189
01:37:46,219 --> 01:37:51,346
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe that's something you might want to do where you do have a hall right around the corner from the project, so.

1190
01:37:51,546 --> 01:37:52,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Mr. President?

1191
01:37:53,547 --> 01:37:54,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice president box.

1192
01:37:54,928 --> 01:38:04,736
[SPEAKER_08]: The Salem street developer hired a private consultant and their job was solely to reach out to the neighborhood and set up neighborhood meetings.

1193
01:38:05,157 --> 01:38:06,318
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't the developer.

1194
01:38:06,918 --> 01:38:12,403
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe in this case it would be helpful to have someone that reaches out to the neighborhood.

1195
01:38:12,743 --> 01:38:14,144
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree with the meeting like that.

1196
01:38:14,564 --> 01:38:15,965
[SPEAKER_08]: But that wasn't done by the developer.

1197
01:38:15,986 --> 01:38:18,888
[SPEAKER_08]: That was done by a consultant that they hired.

1198
01:38:19,589 --> 01:38:25,534
[SPEAKER_08]: that their sole function was to act as a go-between between the developer and the neighborhood.

1199
01:38:26,474 --> 01:38:27,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a suggestion to you, Mr. Zamuto.

1200
01:38:28,296 --> 01:38:30,218
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address of the record, please.

1201
01:38:30,418 --> 01:38:32,880
[SPEAKER_20]: Charlie Zamuto, developer, 87 Method Street.

1202
01:38:33,260 --> 01:38:35,542
[SPEAKER_20]: Your concerns, their concerns, are my concerns.

1203
01:38:36,163 --> 01:38:39,526
[SPEAKER_20]: We designed this building based on shadow.

1204
01:38:39,846 --> 01:38:40,967
[SPEAKER_20]: We have shadow studies.

1205
01:38:41,588 --> 01:38:45,451
[SPEAKER_20]: The trash is gonna be trash chutes inside the building, private pickups.

1206
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:48,775
[SPEAKER_20]: Everything's maintained inside the building.

1207
01:38:48,815 --> 01:38:50,237
[SPEAKER_20]: There's no trash on the outside.

1208
01:38:51,298 --> 01:38:56,502
[SPEAKER_20]: When we had the, when we had our first meeting at the zoning board, I think that the room was packed.

1209
01:38:57,123 --> 01:38:58,904
[SPEAKER_20]: Most of the people came up for the project.

1210
01:38:59,685 --> 01:39:09,634
[SPEAKER_20]: Then a mock need a gang alderman from ward five and some of all we, the city of Medford required me to get a certified map, which I did.

1211
01:39:10,215 --> 01:39:12,937
[SPEAKER_20]: I had to go to city hall in Medford and some of all,

1212
01:39:13,368 --> 01:39:16,289
[SPEAKER_20]: and provide, well, the city put together the abuttalist.

1213
01:39:16,429 --> 01:39:18,809
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know how that works or who sent it.

1214
01:39:19,009 --> 01:39:20,550
[SPEAKER_20]: I think the city of Medford sent it out.

1215
01:39:21,650 --> 01:39:24,070
[SPEAKER_20]: Machnita gang wanted to have a neighborhood meeting.

1216
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:29,752
[SPEAKER_20]: I personally fly at the whole neighborhood around Medford.

1217
01:39:29,952 --> 01:39:32,332
[SPEAKER_20]: Machnita gang didn't even want me to do Medford.

1218
01:39:32,872 --> 01:39:34,473
[SPEAKER_11]: We did from- We don't really care about Machnita.

1219
01:39:34,493 --> 01:39:34,733
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

1220
01:39:35,393 --> 01:39:39,534
[SPEAKER_20]: Alfred Street in Medford down to New Bern Avenue in Medford all the way over to Medford Street.

1221
01:39:41,421 --> 01:39:45,323
[SPEAKER_20]: most of the neighbors that were against this project, I walked around with the plans.

1222
01:39:46,044 --> 01:39:50,507
[SPEAKER_20]: I met with the neighbors and they, you know, when they seen it and I talked to them, explained everything.

1223
01:39:51,087 --> 01:39:55,790
[SPEAKER_20]: They, they had a change of heart and you know, I, Mike, their concerns are my concerns.

1224
01:39:56,350 --> 01:39:57,451
[SPEAKER_20]: We have shadow studies.

1225
01:39:57,551 --> 01:40:08,878
[SPEAKER_20]: We did present them at the neighborhood meeting, but people, you know, some, there was a few people that came that just wanted to argue with Barbara Bruzy, the attorney, and that we weren't allowed to present.

1226
01:40:08,958 --> 01:40:09,879
[SPEAKER_11]: It's right again.

1227
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:31,434
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll reach out again and say, you have the sons of Italy there, have some coffee, Method residents only, and have some coffee that night, and reach out to the residents, and everyone gets to, in an orderly fashion, everyone will get to say their little piece, and hopefully,

1228
01:40:33,663 --> 01:40:35,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe there's facts that some of the residents don't know.

1229
01:40:36,024 --> 01:40:36,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1230
01:40:36,324 --> 01:40:37,064
[SPEAKER_11]: You can make with it.

1231
01:40:37,304 --> 01:40:38,124
[SPEAKER_11]: Just a suggestion.

1232
01:40:38,184 --> 01:40:38,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1233
01:40:39,004 --> 01:40:41,705
[SPEAKER_11]: But again, uh, some good faith goes a long way.

1234
01:40:41,985 --> 01:40:42,325
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1235
01:40:42,345 --> 01:40:45,946
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi real quick.

1236
01:40:46,006 --> 01:40:47,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Cheryl Rodriguez, 21 par street.

1237
01:40:47,886 --> 01:40:52,847
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to mention that the hearing has been closed and the next meeting is for deliberation.

1238
01:40:52,867 --> 01:41:02,710
[SPEAKER_12]: So if there are any questions or neighborhood outreach going to happen, then something has to change at the zoning board of appeals or they're going to make the decision between November 6th and November 10th.

1239
01:41:02,750 --> 01:41:03,410
[SPEAKER_12]: They have not set.

1240
01:41:03,998 --> 01:41:04,718
[SPEAKER_12]: the date of the meeting.

1241
01:41:04,758 --> 01:41:13,500
[SPEAKER_12]: There are also two complaints about open meeting law violations that have been filed about this project, about that meeting, not the particular project, just the meeting.

1242
01:41:14,161 --> 01:41:14,501
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1243
01:41:14,541 --> 01:41:14,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1244
01:41:15,461 --> 01:41:19,922
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo to receive the committee report and place on file.

1245
01:41:21,302 --> 01:41:21,502
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1246
01:41:23,063 --> 01:41:25,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Councilor Marks, you have a resolution you'd like to make.

1247
01:41:28,324 --> 01:41:30,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I, I believe the gentleman answered at least the trash.

1248
01:41:30,985 --> 01:41:32,005
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be self-contained.

1249
01:41:32,398 --> 01:41:38,445
[SPEAKER_08]: There won't be any trash on the exterior of the building, no bins, all private pickup.

1250
01:41:39,406 --> 01:41:47,396
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the study, Mr. President, the shade study, if he can make that available, Mr. President.

1251
01:41:47,797 --> 01:41:48,057
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1252
01:41:48,577 --> 01:41:52,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as a further point, just as a further point.

1253
01:41:53,499 --> 01:41:56,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I can appreciate the developer coming here to make the comment.

1254
01:41:56,600 --> 01:42:04,723
[SPEAKER_03]: But these comments were not made at the public hearing, for which a whole bunch of people, almost 100 in total, were here on that night, whether they were from Somerville or from Medford.

1255
01:42:05,543 --> 01:42:10,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Arguing the case here tonight with only a few of the residents is not the right way to go.

1256
01:42:11,025 --> 01:42:14,286
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue on the sun, the issue on the barrels, that's all well and good.

1257
01:42:14,526 --> 01:42:17,307
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have four people here right now that have never heard it for the first time.

1258
01:42:18,127 --> 01:42:26,643
[SPEAKER_03]: You folks have taken it upon yourself to bring a suit against a developer on Locust Street because you were dissatisfied because the neighborhood was not addressed.

1259
01:42:27,244 --> 01:42:29,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Four of you just attended this past meeting.

1260
01:42:29,841 --> 01:42:31,442
[SPEAKER_03]: this past October 24th meeting.

1261
01:42:31,763 --> 01:42:45,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I would strongly suggest that the four of you, if not seven of you, make a request to the Board of Appeals to ask them to delay any finality to making a decision and to reopen a public hearing to listen to all the stories.

1262
01:42:45,874 --> 01:42:50,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's obvious that they didn't have a chance to listen to the people.

1263
01:42:50,337 --> 01:42:53,900
[SPEAKER_11]: Give the gentleman a chance to have a meeting of the committee.

1264
01:42:54,141 --> 01:42:56,302
[SPEAKER_03]: No, he can have all the meetings he's want.

1265
01:42:56,322 --> 01:42:57,864
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about the Board of Appeals.

1266
01:42:58,604 --> 01:43:05,008
[SPEAKER_03]: As Mrs. Rodriguez just said, they're scheduled to make a final determination first week in November.

1267
01:43:05,308 --> 01:43:07,410
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two official complaints being filed.

1268
01:43:07,770 --> 01:43:10,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they don't respond to them, it goes to the Attorney General's office.

1269
01:43:11,092 --> 01:43:13,173
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, do you really want to go that far?

1270
01:43:13,534 --> 01:43:21,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Or we can resolve it by maybe having the board, seven of you, respectfully request the Board of Appeals to delay any further action and to reopen.

1271
01:43:21,278 --> 01:43:22,359
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not control the Board of Appeals.

1272
01:43:22,859 --> 01:43:23,200
[SPEAKER_11]: Pardon me?

1273
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:24,961
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not control the Board of Appeals.

1274
01:43:25,680 --> 01:43:27,181
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to make a, you make a resolution.

1275
01:43:28,042 --> 01:43:29,623
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm asking a council Lungel Curran.

1276
01:43:29,683 --> 01:43:32,124
[SPEAKER_11]: She heard what I said.

1277
01:43:32,144 --> 01:43:32,705
[SPEAKER_11]: She just did.

1278
01:43:32,825 --> 01:43:33,785
[SPEAKER_11]: She just did.

1279
01:43:33,805 --> 01:43:34,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1280
01:43:35,006 --> 01:43:35,286
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1281
01:43:36,467 --> 01:43:38,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I want to hear it when you sit down.

1282
01:43:39,009 --> 01:43:40,270
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll do our business.

1283
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:40,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1284
01:43:41,891 --> 01:43:49,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Lungel Curran would you like to make a motion?

1285
01:43:49,516 --> 01:43:49,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1286
01:43:49,796 --> 01:43:50,456
[SPEAKER_17]: President Caraviello.

1287
01:43:50,516 --> 01:43:53,178
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it just all falls in line with just a lot.

1288
01:43:54,064 --> 01:43:55,304
[SPEAKER_17]: allowing the people to be heard.

1289
01:43:55,445 --> 01:44:03,747
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would, I will make any request that has any ounce of a possibility to resolve that problem.

1290
01:44:03,848 --> 01:44:08,729
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would request that the mayor, number one, the mayor set up a meeting between the residents and the developer.

1291
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:21,774
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would also request that to the zoning board of appeals that they delay deliberations and have a public meeting for public participation on that project at their next meeting.

1292
01:44:23,243 --> 01:44:28,747
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Council Member Curran, seconded by Vice President Marks.

1293
01:44:30,188 --> 01:44:31,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1296
01:44:39,574 --> 01:44:40,195
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Francis?

1297
01:44:40,335 --> 01:44:40,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1298
01:44:41,596 --> 01:44:42,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Mack?

1299
01:44:42,216 --> 01:44:42,436
[SPEAKER_16]: No.

1300
01:44:43,257 --> 01:44:43,938
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Curran?

1301
01:44:44,058 --> 01:44:44,338
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

01:44:51,965 --> 01:44:54,386
[SPEAKER_11]: five in the front of the negative motion passes.

01:44:54,726 --> 01:44:58,487
[SPEAKER_11]: I think four, three, four, three passes.

1310
01:44:58,927 --> 01:44:59,567
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

01:45:06,610 --> 01:45:10,871
[SPEAKER_02]: If, if, if I may just really quick, it is the first Wednesday of the month tomorrow, November 1st.

1314
01:45:11,971 --> 01:45:17,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, that means it's time for the monthly community police meeting at the Roberts elementary school.

1315
01:45:18,445 --> 01:45:25,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone is welcome, no matter what neighborhood you're from, 7 p.m., Roberts Elementary School, monthly Method police meeting.

01:45:26,169 --> 01:45:26,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1318

[SPEAKER_11]: The records of October 17th were passed to Sorcerer Lundell Kern.

1319
01:45:34,534 --> 01:45:36,335
[SPEAKER_11]: Madam Sorcerer, how did you find those records?

1320
01:45:39,488 --> 01:45:41,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Adam Saucer will be requested to be tabled again.

1321
01:45:42,290 --> 01:45:46,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Records of the meeting of October 24th, 2017 were passed to Councilor Scarpelli.

1322
01:45:47,193 --> 01:45:48,954
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli, how did you find those records?

1323
01:45:56,718 --> 01:46:00,521
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Councilor Maggs to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1324
01:46:00,541 --> 01:46:01,141
[SPEAKER_11]: All in favor?

1325
01:46:02,042 --> 01:46:02,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion.

1326
01:46:13,145 --> 01:46:13,579
[SPEAKER_21]: paper on.

1327
01:47:07,157 --> 01:47:11,540
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to engage everybody must benefit on this project.

1328
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:13,922
[SPEAKER_22]: Everyone has to have something.

1329
01:47:14,562 --> 01:47:17,744
[SPEAKER_22]: Otherwise, if someone don't have anything, there will be trouble.

1330
01:47:18,545 --> 01:47:24,389
[SPEAKER_22]: I have gone through this experience and I know tourism business is for everybody.

1331
01:47:25,129 --> 01:47:29,472
[SPEAKER_22]: First of all, I didn't really know this, so I was greedy a bit.

1332
01:47:30,452 --> 01:47:33,074
[SPEAKER_22]: But I find it out that no, that's not the way.

1333
01:47:33,634 --> 01:47:42,459
[SPEAKER_22]: I have to engage everybody in the tourism business so that everybody will benefit and everybody is happy now.

1334
01:47:43,688 --> 01:47:52,741
[SPEAKER_19]: Looking to the future, the demand for cruise ship holidays is going to continue not just this year but the next decade and probably the one after that.

1335
01:47:53,342 --> 01:47:57,008
[SPEAKER_19]: So is the new generation ready to step into your shoes?

1336
01:47:58,020 --> 01:48:04,683
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, because we are in our retiring age now, but they have to learn from us.

1337
01:48:05,503 --> 01:48:10,045
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're really running it like a business, you want success.

1338
01:48:11,025 --> 01:48:13,666
[SPEAKER_22]: You have to engage the community in it.

1339
01:48:13,966 --> 01:48:17,207
[SPEAKER_22]: I say this because I went through all this experience.

1340
01:48:17,768 --> 01:48:18,788
[SPEAKER_22]: That is why I know.

1341
01:48:19,668 --> 01:48:23,310
[SPEAKER_22]: If the next people that takes over, if they are like us,

1342
01:48:24,810 --> 01:48:28,512
[SPEAKER_22]: the business of the cruise ship will go for more years.

1343
01:48:29,072 --> 01:48:36,395
[SPEAKER_22]: But if they are not like us, I think it will be a big question mark to Mr. Allen and the cruise ships.
