1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,957
test one two.

2
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:14,154
this machine.

3
00:08:49,528 --> 00:08:49,751
Sigh.

4
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:36,660
Good evening, everyone.

5
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:44,204
Normally, the city clerk would preside to begin the council's first meeting of the year until a president is elected for 2026.

6
00:17:45,665 --> 00:17:55,229
However, given the vacancy in the office of the city clerk, the council agreed that the duty should fall to Councilor Scarpelli as the longest serving councilor.

7
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,930
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

8
00:17:58,151 --> 00:17:59,051
The gavel is yours.

9
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:05,134
Oh, Zach, I'm not going to let it go.

10
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:08,921
Thank you, Mr Clark.

11
00:18:09,141 --> 00:18:12,162
Um, if we can, can you take the role, please?

12
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,063
Yes.

13
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:21,285
Okay.

14
00:18:21,305 --> 00:18:22,245
Councilor Callahan.

15
00:18:26,027 --> 00:18:29,088
Councilors are Oh, Councilor Living.

16
00:18:31,148 --> 00:18:32,088
Councilor Scarpelli.

17
00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:36,990
Councilor saying Councilor Moline.

18
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:41,356
President Beers, Counselor Beers.

19
00:18:41,436 --> 00:18:41,796
Present.

20
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:45,740
Seven present, none absent.

21
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,841
Thank you, Mr. Clerk.

22
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:49,203
If we can all please rise, salute the flag.

23
00:18:49,223 --> 00:19:03,417
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

24
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:06,699
Thank you.

25
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:09,460
Now we'll move to our motions.

26
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:16,624
We have a motion to 6-001 election of council president for 2026.

27
00:19:18,164 --> 00:19:21,706
The floor is open for any nominations for council president.

28
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:35,552
Uh, I nominate Isaac B. Zach bears for president.

29
00:19:36,323 --> 00:19:39,105
Thank you, nomination Isaacs, Zach Beers.

30
00:19:40,205 --> 00:19:51,412
Second for... Nomination from Councilor Zaro, seconded by Councilor Callahan for Councilor Zach Beers.

31
00:19:53,254 --> 00:19:54,374
We have any other nominations?

32
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,276
Nominations are closed.

33
00:19:58,637 --> 00:20:00,318
Mr. Clerk, can you call the roll?

34
00:20:05,773 --> 00:20:06,554
Councilor Callahan?

35
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:06,634
Yes.

36
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:09,597
Councilor Lazaro?

37
00:20:10,258 --> 00:20:10,398
Yes.

38
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:12,300
Councilor Lemming?

39
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:12,780
Yes.

40
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:14,942
Councilor Scarpelli?

41
00:20:14,962 --> 00:20:15,043
Yes.

42
00:20:15,443 --> 00:20:16,284
Councilor Zach Beers?

43
00:20:16,304 --> 00:20:16,384
Yes.

44
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:18,206
Councilor Singh?

45
00:20:18,226 --> 00:20:18,286
Yes.

46
00:20:19,067 --> 00:20:19,467
Councilor Zach Beers?

47
00:20:19,487 --> 00:20:19,547
Yes.

48
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:22,310
Councilor Milley?

49
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:22,390
Yes.

50
00:20:26,374 --> 00:20:26,975
Councilor Beers?

51
00:20:26,995 --> 00:20:27,055
Yes.

52
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:32,726
Six yes, one present.

53
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:35,308
Congratulations, Council President 2026 Zach Bares.

54
00:21:00,913 --> 00:21:01,953
Meanwhile, I'm trying to give it away.

55
00:21:04,794 --> 00:21:11,076
I'll be brief, and I just want to thank everyone for your trust in me to serve as president for another year.

56
00:21:12,017 --> 00:21:24,081
It is not easy work, and we have even more difficult work ahead to hire a city clerk and work with our new city clerk and our clerk staff to

57
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:29,702
get that office where it needs to be and even better than it ever has been.

58
00:21:29,782 --> 00:21:31,263
So that's going to be an important project.

59
00:21:31,383 --> 00:21:36,004
I look forward to working with whoever is nominated for Vice President on that work.

60
00:21:37,364 --> 00:21:52,448
And something that I talked about on Sunday at the inauguration is just how important it is that we work hard to restore some faith that even when we disagree, we are hearing each other, we're respecting each other,

61
00:21:53,222 --> 00:21:54,934
and we can work together to get things done.

62
00:21:55,707 --> 00:22:00,369
We're never going to all agree on everything that happens in this chamber or what happens in the city.

63
00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:17,357
We're going to have some loud disagreements sometimes, but I think the important part is that people feel like they can say their piece, and then when a decision is made, people feel like they were at least able to be heard out by those who disagree with them.

64
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:23,760
That's something that I've been thinking about a lot over the last six months and what I want to bring to the next

65
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,287
two years here on the City Council.

66
00:22:26,547 --> 00:22:33,729
So I'm really excited to do that alongside all six of you and work with our assistant clerk here, Rich Alicio, to do that as well.

67
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:47,974
And hopefully as well honor our friend Larry Lepore and get a city messenger back over in a seat over there or maybe in a new role doing some different things, but moving that role forward.

68
00:22:48,314 --> 00:22:50,715
That's on our agenda tonight as well and I hope

69
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:56,321
someone here can help lead the charge, because we need that position filled.

70
00:22:56,381 --> 00:23:00,624
So just want to say thank you again, and let's get to work.

71
00:23:04,025 --> 00:23:10,989
And George was supposed to say that I was supposed to be sworn in, so I better do that first.

72
00:23:15,471 --> 00:23:16,211
Please raise your right hand.

73
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:17,592
Repeat after me.

74
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:31,230
I, Isaac B. Zach Bares, do solemnly affirm that I will faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as President of the Medford City Council.

75
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,032
According to the best of my ability, understanding, agreeable,

76
00:23:41,033 --> 00:23:42,194
to the rules and regulations.

77
00:23:42,514 --> 00:23:43,896
Agreeable to the rules and regulations.

78
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:44,616
Of the constitution.

79
00:23:44,636 --> 00:23:45,437
Of the constitution.

80
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:46,398
The laws of this commonwealth.

81
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:47,238
The laws of this commonwealth.

82
00:23:47,258 --> 00:23:48,499
And the ordinances of the city of Manfred.

83
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,901
And the ordinances of the city of Manfred.

84
00:23:49,921 --> 00:23:50,801
Congratulations, sir.

85
00:23:50,821 --> 00:23:51,082
Thank you.

86
00:23:51,102 --> 00:23:51,222
Thanks.

87
00:23:58,008 --> 00:24:02,391
All right, on to the fun stuff.

88
00:24:02,411 --> 00:24:06,955
26002, election of a city council vice president for 2026.

89
00:24:09,141 --> 00:24:13,462
Do we have nominations for Vice President of the City Council, Councilor Callahan?

90
00:24:15,023 --> 00:24:16,703
I nominate Councilor Emily Lazaro.

91
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:19,884
Councilor Callahan nominates Councilor Lazaro.

92
00:24:19,944 --> 00:24:20,645
Is there a second?

93
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:22,725
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

94
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:26,206
Are there any other nominations for Vice President of the Medford City Council?

95
00:24:29,568 --> 00:24:31,148
Seeing none, nominations are closed.

96
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:37,090
Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, call the roll and you will say the person's name.

97
00:24:43,063 --> 00:24:43,983
Councilor Kellyanne?

98
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:45,864
Yes, Councilor.

99
00:24:45,964 --> 00:24:46,544
Emily Lazaro.

100
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:49,344
Councilor Lazaro?

101
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:49,584
Present.

102
00:24:51,765 --> 00:24:52,565
Councilor Lemming?

103
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:54,825
Uh, Councilor Emily Lazaro.

104
00:24:55,846 --> 00:24:56,786
Councilor Scarpelli?

105
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:58,266
Councilor Emily Lazaro.

106
00:24:58,906 --> 00:24:59,666
Councilor Singh?

107
00:25:01,987 --> 00:25:02,767
Councilor Emily Lazaro.

108
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:03,687
Councilor Mullane?

109
00:25:03,707 --> 00:25:04,347
Councilor Emily Lazaro.

110
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:06,288
President Beers?

111
00:25:06,888 --> 00:25:07,928
Councilor Lazaro.

112
00:25:10,249 --> 00:25:12,069
Six in favor, one present.

113
00:25:12,685 --> 00:25:14,906
with six for Councilor Lazaro and one present.

114
00:25:15,006 --> 00:25:17,246
Councilor Lazaro is elected vice president for 2026.

115
00:25:18,047 --> 00:25:18,687
Congratulations.

116
00:25:20,528 --> 00:25:24,189
And if you could come up here and the clerk will administer the oath.

117
00:25:33,192 --> 00:25:33,992
Please raise your right hand.

118
00:25:35,212 --> 00:25:36,713
Repeat after me.

119
00:25:36,733 --> 00:25:37,453
I, Emily Lazaro,

120
00:25:37,895 --> 00:26:01,097
I, Emily Lazzaro, do solemnly affirm, do solemnly affirm, that I will faithfully, that I will faithfully, and impartially, and impartially, discharge and perform, discharge and perform, all the duties incumbent upon me, all the duties incumbent upon me, as Vice President of the Medford City Council, as Vice President of the Medford City Council, according to the best of my ability, according to the best of my ability, agreeable, agreeable,

121
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:13,137
to the rules and regulations of the Constitution, to the rules and regulations of the Constitution, the laws of the Commonwealth, the laws of the Commonwealth and the ordinances of the city of Medford and the ordinances of the city of Medford.

122
00:26:13,357 --> 00:26:14,018
Congratulations.

123
00:26:14,318 --> 00:26:14,578
Thank you.

124
00:26:19,603 --> 00:26:20,144
Thank you all.

125
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:22,767
I'm very happy to perform this role.

126
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:23,988
I'm really looking forward to it.

127
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:25,950
They're very big shoes to fill.

128
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:34,898
Counselor Kit Collins performed this role for the last term and did so with wonderful, quiet dignity.

129
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,841
A lot of this work is

130
00:26:38,602 --> 00:26:42,006
administrative and you know scheduling related.

131
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:51,316
But I really look forward to taking on that role and improving our processes here and working in partnership with President Behrs.

132
00:26:51,697 --> 00:26:56,642
And I'm I'm eager to take on this responsibility for the city.

133
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:57,323
Thank you all.

134
00:27:03,969 --> 00:27:05,530
All right, that's out of the way.

135
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,553
26-003, appointment of a City Messenger for 2026 and 2027.

136
00:27:10,673 --> 00:27:26,122
As folks know, the role of City Messenger has been vacant since the passing of Larry Lepore, who served in the role for decades and was just a wonderful person who we miss every meeting and every day.

137
00:27:26,963 --> 00:27:28,704
Something that was in discussion

138
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:51,237
before the leave and following separation, leaving the city, resignation, stepping down of Clerk Hurtubise was to kind of bring that role into the future and that looking like someone to essentially assist with our work on the city council in a different way than had been done in the past.

139
00:27:53,039 --> 00:28:02,773
was helping often with the agendas on Fridays, bringing them in paper copies to our homes, something that my mom, when I was living there, really enjoyed.

140
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,531
And just having a wonderful conversation with Larry every day.

141
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:10,973
But I think over the past year or so, we've gotten pretty used to digital delivery.

142
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:15,274
And maybe that isn't the role that that will take anymore.

143
00:28:15,554 --> 00:28:23,557
But there are so many other things that this council needs help and support with in terms of liaising within the building and in terms of

144
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:39,262
you know, helping us with correspondence and all of the things, as folks know, the City Council has only two appointments in this whole city, and we only supervise two employees, and that's our City Clerk and our City Messenger.

145
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:47,170
And right now, both of those positions are vacant, so you can imagine what that looks like for each of us, and to be frank,

146
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:55,032
especially for me and for Assistant Clerk Alicio here, soon to be, I believe, pending a vote, formerly our acting clerk.

147
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:00,703
Adam left, well, and maybe even been the acting clerk since January 1st, according to the law.

148
00:29:01,264 --> 00:29:02,305
So we're affirming that.

149
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:06,888
But being down those positions has definitely been tough.

150
00:29:07,488 --> 00:29:16,274
And I think what would be really, obviously we don't have someone to appoint right now, and we still need to get to the bottom of exactly what that position will look like.

151
00:29:16,394 --> 00:29:23,238
So with Vice President Lazaro and maybe with someone else here, I think it would be really great to also start

152
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:28,943
getting finalized on being able to bring on a new city messenger for our new term.

153
00:29:29,443 --> 00:29:30,664
So I would really appreciate that.

154
00:29:30,724 --> 00:29:39,270
And I think something we maybe could do right now for a few minutes if folks wanted to is just share some thoughts or volunteer to assist the vice president.

155
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:44,554
Thoughts on what the position might look like or who might be helping our vice president with that.

156
00:29:44,654 --> 00:29:48,717
So I'll turn the floor over and then we'll have to table this for the time being.

157
00:29:48,817 --> 00:29:50,058
But I'll go to Councilor Callahan.

158
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:56,484
I know in a lot of other cities they have more dedicated staff.

159
00:29:56,585 --> 00:30:00,286
Sometimes every city councilor has a dedicated staff.

160
00:30:00,306 --> 00:30:04,928
And so many people reach out to us by email and phone.

161
00:30:05,608 --> 00:30:10,510
And many of those questions are simply questions about where to go in the administration to get the help that they need.

162
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:17,793
And I would love it if the city messenger or whatever we call that role would be able to do constituent services

163
00:30:18,593 --> 00:30:29,984
and really immediately answering those questions for people when they are not specific to a city councilor, but when they really are just how to navigate the city administration to get the help that they are looking for.

164
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:33,867
Great.

165
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:35,929
Do we have any other thoughts on that at this time?

166
00:30:39,852 --> 00:30:40,773
Seeing none, is there a motion?

167
00:30:43,335 --> 00:30:43,916
Councilor Singh?

168
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,212
On the motion to table by Councilor Sang, seconded by?

169
00:30:48,812 --> 00:30:50,013
Seconded by Councilor Zaro.

170
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:50,934
All those in favor?

171
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:52,235
Opposed?

172
00:30:52,255 --> 00:30:53,015
The motion passes.

173
00:30:56,618 --> 00:30:59,860
24004, resolution to adopt the standing committee rules from the prior year.

174
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:05,404
Be it resolved that the standing committee rules be adopted as the standing rules of the city council insofar as they're applicable.

175
00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:09,728
This just means that the rules we had on December 31st are the rules we have now.

176
00:31:11,229 --> 00:31:11,949
Any further discussion?

177
00:31:12,269 --> 00:31:12,770
Councilor Sang?

178
00:31:13,948 --> 00:31:16,291
No further discussion, this is pretty procedural.

179
00:31:16,812 --> 00:31:17,673
I motion to approve.

180
00:31:18,074 --> 00:31:18,314
Great.

181
00:31:18,955 --> 00:31:20,417
And did you want to say?

182
00:31:21,018 --> 00:31:21,519
Okay, great.

183
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:24,082

All those in favor?

186
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:27,783
Opposed?

187
00:31:27,883 --> 00:31:29,984
Motion passes.

188
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:34,906
26005, resolution to transfer all papers and committee from 2025 to 2026.

189
00:31:36,466 --> 00:31:42,508
Be it resolved that the city council transfer all papers and committee or on the table, this should say from the 2025 council to the 2026 council.

190
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:43,849
Is there a motion to amend?

191
00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:47,810
Councilor Sang?

192
00:31:51,047 --> 00:31:52,208
Motion to amend and approve.

Seconded by Council Vice President Lazaro.

195
00:32:00,072 --> 00:32:00,672
All those in favor?

196
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:00,752
Aye.

197
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:02,033
Opposed?

198
00:32:02,073 --> 00:32:02,893
The motion passes.

199
00:32:03,934 --> 00:32:06,055
Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports and records.

200
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:06,715
Records.

201
00:32:06,775 --> 00:32:10,337
The records of the meeting of December 16th, 2025 were passed to Vice President Lazaro.

202
00:32:10,377 --> 00:32:12,138
Vice President Lazaro, how did you find those records?

203
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:14,172
I found them in order and motion to approve.

204
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:16,994
On the motion of Vice President Lazaro to approve, seconded by?

205
00:32:17,014 --> 00:32:17,214
Seconded.

206
00:32:17,774 --> 00:32:18,835
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

207
00:32:19,075 --> 00:32:19,636
All those in favor?

208
00:32:19,656 --> 00:32:20,436
Aye.

209
00:32:20,456 --> 00:32:20,796
Opposed?

210
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:21,637
The motion passes.

211
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:29,962
Reports of committees, 22231, offered by Matt Lemming, City Councilor, Planning and Permitting Committee, December 16th, 2025 report.

212
00:32:30,062 --> 00:32:35,486
Councilor Lemming is the, well, was the Vice Chair of the Planning and Permitting Committee last term.

213
00:32:36,226 --> 00:32:41,550
Its Chair, Councilor Collins, is no longer on the Council, so I'll recognize Councilor Lemming.

214
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:44,476
Thank you, Council President Behrs.

215
00:32:45,097 --> 00:32:50,624
At the Planning and Permanent Committee meeting on December 16th, we went over a draft of a

216
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:56,765
condominium conversion ordinance that Chair Collins drafted.

217
00:32:57,285 --> 00:33:01,267
She summarized some of the key points in the condo conversion ordinance.

218
00:33:01,307 --> 00:33:10,331
Essentially, it's a process for converting multi-units to condominiums, the establishment of a board to oversee that process, and so on.

219
00:33:11,231 --> 00:33:12,331
Most of the discussion was

220
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:22,835
just about what the ordinance is, some of the details in it, and folks are free to look at that for a very fine overview of that.

221
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:25,096
This is something we'll be working on in the future.

222
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:26,856
Motion to approve.

223
00:33:28,497 --> 00:33:32,038
On the motion to approve by Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Sang.

224
00:33:32,198 --> 00:33:32,838
All those in favor?

225
00:33:32,858 --> 00:33:32,918
Aye.

226
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,038
Opposed?

227
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:35,059
The motion passes.

228
00:33:36,219 --> 00:33:37,219
Councilor Scarpelli.

229
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,820
Can we take paper 260

230
00:33:43,216 --> 00:33:46,453
1-1 under suspension.

231
00:33:47,055 --> 00:33:51,559
On the motion to suspend the rules to take paper 26011 by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by?

232
00:33:52,059 --> 00:33:53,260
Seconded by Councilor Lemming.

233
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:53,921
All those in favor?

234
00:33:54,281 --> 00:33:54,381
Aye.

235
00:33:54,822 --> 00:33:55,222
Opposed?

236
00:33:55,262 --> 00:33:58,104
The motion passes.

237
00:33:58,124 --> 00:34:02,488
26011, resolution to conduct comprehensive review of ambulance EMS contract negotiation and transition.

238
00:34:03,028 --> 00:34:08,533
Whereas the city of Bedford has entered into a new ambulance service contract representing a significant change in public safety service delivery.

239
00:34:09,094 --> 00:34:15,179
And whereas questions have been raised regarding the negotiation process, financial management, in terms of service levels and cost implications of this transition.

240
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:21,963
And whereas the City Council has a fiduciary responsibility to ensure taxpayer funds are used efficiently and public safety standards are maintained.

241
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:29,929
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council hold a committee of the whole meeting to conduct a comprehensive review of the ambulance service contract negotiation process and transition.

242
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:30,750
Councilor Scarpelli.

243
00:34:31,851 --> 00:34:34,552
Thank you, Mr. President.

244
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:39,296
First, I'd like to thank everybody that's here tonight.

245
00:34:39,856 --> 00:34:40,897
This is something that

246
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:58,454
When we received an email from the mayor back on December 10th to inform the council that we would be moving to negotiate our contract, the ambulance contract and open it up for negotiations, we applaud that.

247
00:34:58,514 --> 00:34:59,674
That's the mayor's prerogative.

248
00:35:00,214 --> 00:35:03,795
That's her role that the mayor oversees.

249
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:08,757
The mayor oversees the contractual process in these types of positions.

250
00:35:11,372 --> 00:35:16,895
I will tell you on a personal level, as soon as I read that, I stopped, I froze.

251
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:23,799
And there's a reason why I took such personal attention to this matter.

252
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:36,205
My parents were both ambulatory and they were in a neighboring community that were at the time under another ambulance company.

253
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:44,848
It's very difficult for a son to watch their mother and father pass and every little thing becomes magnified.

254
00:35:45,689 --> 00:35:56,173
And mom would, I would leave Medford to race over next door to wake her up at 4 o'clock in the morning.

255
00:35:56,513 --> 00:35:57,413
I'd help her get changed.

256
00:35:58,194 --> 00:36:04,576
I'd feed her her breakfast and we'd get ready to wait for our ambulance, our ride to Somerville for her dialysis treatment.

257
00:36:07,347 --> 00:36:23,815
And it was difficult because everything was serious, whether the ambulance was 10 minutes late, whether the straps were on too tight, whether they acknowledged her properly, whether she was warm, whether she felt comfortable with those people.

258
00:36:24,956 --> 00:36:29,038
And I can honestly say my mother didn't feel that way.

259
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:43,099
I did everything I could to make sure that I did my due diligence as her son to make sure that I find a company that would service her so she felt comfortable.

260
00:36:45,861 --> 00:36:49,444
We switched for Armstrong, and Armstrong started picking her up.

261
00:36:50,865 --> 00:36:53,607
And instantly, they knew my mom's name.

262
00:36:54,508 --> 00:36:55,308
They were there early.

263
00:36:56,329 --> 00:36:57,290
My mom didn't have to wait.

264
00:36:58,532 --> 00:37:00,673
They gently would pick my mom off her seat.

265
00:37:01,014 --> 00:37:03,475
They would place her in the gurney.

266
00:37:03,715 --> 00:37:04,836
They would put her in the ambulance.

267
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:06,177
And I would follow her.

268
00:37:07,037 --> 00:37:09,599
I would follow the ambulance to Somerville because that's what a good son does.

269
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:18,544
And I would see my mom, go into dialysis, and I would watch the care that these professionals had for my mom.

270
00:37:21,626 --> 00:37:22,706
And then I would pick her up.

271
00:37:22,726 --> 00:37:23,427
I would leave work.

272
00:37:23,447 --> 00:37:24,608
I would take my lunch every day at 11.30.

273
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:28,643
And I would wait for the ambulance, and they would pick mom up.

274
00:37:29,443 --> 00:37:37,130
And at the time, after a long, grueling dialysis session, they would take mom, who was just a puddle then, and take her home.

275
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,212
They would carry her in.

276
00:37:39,452 --> 00:37:41,534
They would place her on her couch, on her seat.

277
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:43,156
They'd make sure she was warm.

278
00:37:44,437 --> 00:37:46,539
And maybe once in a while, a little kiss on the forehead.

279
00:37:49,161 --> 00:37:52,364
So when I saw this, I said, what is going on here?

280
00:37:53,373 --> 00:38:01,577
what is happening to a service that this community has had for over 25 years, that we've had no issues, no concerns, no problems.

281
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:04,419
They've always been there for us, no matter what.

282
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:10,442
So I reached out to the mayor and I said, Madam Mayor, on a personal level, this is something very close to me.

283
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:11,682
What are we doing?

284
00:38:11,702 --> 00:38:14,084
I think this is dangerous.

285
00:38:16,245 --> 00:38:20,227
Armstrong is the company that everyone should aspire to.

286
00:38:23,056 --> 00:38:26,918
The mayor said, I'll set up a meeting with the chiefs.

287
00:38:26,958 --> 00:38:27,638
They can explain.

288
00:38:28,758 --> 00:38:32,720
So I didn't know what was going on in the business side of the process.

289
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,362
So I met with both Chief Evans and Chief Buckley via phone.

290
00:38:37,722 --> 00:38:41,124
And they shared a lot of information, a lot that shocked me.

291
00:38:42,644 --> 00:38:44,845
And I said, jeez, that's telling.

292
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:50,808
And I understood that changing over an ambulance service, no matter what,

293
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:54,809
is going to leave us in some jeopardy just because of that changeover.

294
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,510
So public safety to me was paramount.

295
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:03,112
Both Chief Buckley and Chief Evans explained the situations.

296
00:39:03,192 --> 00:39:05,093
I explained if they were part of the process.

297
00:39:05,613 --> 00:39:07,794
They both explained where they were on the process.

298
00:39:09,694 --> 00:39:12,355
I then reached out to Armstrong because I had that relationship.

299
00:39:13,235 --> 00:39:19,578
Because back when Mom was in Stoneham, I knew the process.

300
00:39:19,938 --> 00:39:20,738
I knew who to talk to.

301
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:26,032
I'm an educated person who makes sure he does right by his parents.

302
00:39:27,914 --> 00:39:37,781
So I met with Armstrong, and I talked to Rich Raymond, I talked to Sean Mangan, and I asked them what's going on.

303
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:39,822
And they explained the process.

304
00:39:40,482 --> 00:39:41,803
And I found something very alarming.

305
00:39:42,664 --> 00:39:47,988
I found that everything that my chiefs were saying, Armstrong was saying, yes, we'll do that.

306
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:50,810
So I said, geez, there's a disconnect there.

307
00:39:52,645 --> 00:39:54,106
And then I started doing some homework.

308
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:55,808
And I reached out to neighboring communities.

309
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:59,170
I reached out to chiefs that had both services.

310
00:40:01,873 --> 00:40:02,793
And I found it alarming.

311
00:40:04,095 --> 00:40:05,095
And I talked to our chiefs.

312
00:40:05,155 --> 00:40:10,440
And I said, please reach out to these chiefs, police chiefs, fire chiefs, deputy chiefs.

313
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,962
Ask them, get their input before we make this change.

314
00:40:14,163 --> 00:40:14,904
I talked to the mayor.

315
00:40:14,944 --> 00:40:16,104
I met with the mayor again.

316
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,025
We had a conversation.

317
00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:20,068
I said, Madam Mayor, thank you for setting up the meeting.

318
00:40:20,802 --> 00:40:22,643
I appreciate that, but there's definitely a disconnect.

319
00:40:23,604 --> 00:40:25,064
I've talked to neighboring communities.

320
00:40:25,205 --> 00:40:26,285
Have you spoken with them?

321
00:40:26,745 --> 00:40:31,328
And quote, unquote, the mayor said, geez, George, you're giving me more work, but I'll definitely look into it.

322
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:40,213
And I know that our chiefs did their due diligence because I talked to the chiefs from neighboring communities, reached back out and said, yeah, they talked to our chiefs.

323
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:43,155
And I said, great, so let's move this forward.

324
00:40:44,232 --> 00:41:03,322
And as the process went on, I then reached back out to the mayor in a text, and I said, I think the chiefs were on that, and I said, as we sat through the process, and I'm not part of the process, but I think there's a huge problem here that at the 13th hour, it seems to be that I'm the only one talking to all the parties.

325
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:06,824
I'm the only one that's listening to everybody.

326
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:13,508
So I said, please, can you sit one more time with everybody so we don't make any mistakes?

327
00:41:14,462 --> 00:41:18,123
Now, the other company, come in and be great.

328
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,043
It's not about the other company.

329
00:41:20,863 --> 00:41:24,464
This is about the company we have today, the company we've had for over 25 years.

330
00:41:27,265 --> 00:41:36,527
And I was told that the five members on the committee all feel strong enough that they all supported this change.

331
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:37,067
We needed it.

332
00:41:39,058 --> 00:41:42,960
And there's a lot of things that that have to come out.

333
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:53,043
And that's why I've asked to send this to a committee of the whole next week and possibly ask the chair to possibly look at executive session so we can talk about more in depth information.

334
00:41:54,024 --> 00:42:01,927
I know people in this room are very angry with me because this is happening because the fear of or the understanding of that calling

335
00:42:03,473 --> 00:42:09,019
Armstrong out and putting them on the spot tonight is something that's going to be detrimental to our community.

336
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:20,210
To the contrary, because what Rich Raymond did, Rich Raymond stood up and said, George, listen, I'm willing to come and do anything that needs to be done so everybody understands the process.

337
00:42:21,731 --> 00:42:23,393
That's how important Method is to them.

338
00:42:25,718 --> 00:42:33,301
To the point where even Rich said, if anything happens, no matter if it's with the other company here or with the other company, if something goes bad, we're going to be here anyway from Medford.

339
00:42:33,321 --> 00:42:35,101
Because that's the type of people they are.

340
00:42:36,722 --> 00:42:48,786
So I felt strong enough, no matter how people that I respect immensely felt by me bringing this forward was a mistake, I needed to make sure that I brought this forward because it is important.

341
00:42:50,486 --> 00:42:52,467
I gave you my perspective as a son.

342
00:42:55,112 --> 00:42:59,996
But now I'm talking to you as a city councilor that's looking at our community's public safety.

343
00:43:01,877 --> 00:43:03,678
So there are a lot of things that we'll move forward.

344
00:43:04,279 --> 00:43:12,524
The social media's gone out, and they've chimed in, and they've gotten word something about contracts and money and this and that.

345
00:43:14,126 --> 00:43:21,611
If that's the case, that's why we want to go to executive session and committee the whole meeting relatively quick.

346
00:43:23,219 --> 00:43:26,821
But tonight, I wanted to bring this forward to understand that this is important.

347
00:43:28,101 --> 00:43:45,169
And if you talk to neighboring communities, and you talk to them, and they share just the fear of turning over ambulance companies, the fear of something bad possibly happening, percentage has increased dramatically.

348
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:50,091
I don't want anybody in our community to be that percentage.

349
00:43:51,512 --> 00:43:52,152
It's not worth it.

350
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:10,868
And like I said, if when I talked to our administration, our team, and they said A, B, and C, and then I spoke with the leadership from Armstrong, and they said exactly what was being said, I would say, well, you made your bed.

351
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:11,648
We need to move on.

352
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:13,469
But it was the opposite.

353
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:15,850
It was the opposite.

354
00:44:17,211 --> 00:44:18,792
When they talked about the behavior bus,

355
00:44:20,361 --> 00:44:21,442
We'll use that for an example.

356
00:44:21,522 --> 00:44:35,829
That being one of the key points why Medford went with this new company, that we can work with mental health and drug abuse in a more swifter, more controlled fashion to get people help faster.

357
00:44:38,451 --> 00:44:46,055
I had a great conversation with Rich in understanding that this process was started three years ago first to do this here in Medford.

358
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:49,957
And then it was brought up in negotiations

359
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:53,328
And then it stopped.

360
00:44:54,909 --> 00:45:02,870
So there are things that were presented to the public that I think for city council, for the people I represent, we need to clear the air so we can move on.

361
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:07,011
Whether there's a way we could stop this and stay with Armstrong or whether you move on.

362
00:45:11,192 --> 00:45:19,114
So I'm not here to entertain any of the other options of why we did this, why we did that.

363
00:45:20,295 --> 00:45:21,675
My perspective is very simple.

364
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,001
I spoke to all the parties.

365
00:45:28,865 --> 00:45:32,208
I went through what Armstrong did for my loved ones.

366
00:45:35,391 --> 00:45:41,837
I see a deep issue here with the lack of communication with people that are sitting down at the table.

367
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:45,921
So that being said, Council President,

368
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:52,371
There's a reason why that we need a more robust conversation.

369
00:45:52,932 --> 00:46:06,662
I think sending this to Committee of the Whole so we could talk about, more importantly, what a response time looks like so residents can understand how amazing Armstrong is.

370
00:46:07,822 --> 00:46:16,649
We can talk about the different pieces that were important in that contract that Armstrong has already given us and continue to give to us.

371
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:23,412
Having that meeting in an open forum where we can talk openly, I think it's important.

372
00:46:24,632 --> 00:46:34,256
So I would ask that we motion to take this to Committee of the Whole with possibilities, if using private information, that we go to executive session.

373
00:46:34,896 --> 00:46:44,700
And again, I apologize for my emotion, but it means something to me.

374
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:48,162
But the way I looked at it is this.

375
00:46:49,134 --> 00:46:52,876
there's another Lily Scarpelli that's going through dialysis today.

376
00:46:54,416 --> 00:47:00,999
And I don't know if she has a son or a daughter that can do what my sister and myself did.

377
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,221
So that's why I'm going to fight for this.

378
00:47:04,561 --> 00:47:06,982
So, Mr. President, I make that motion.

379
00:47:07,102 --> 00:47:07,382
Thank you.

380
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,250
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

381
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:17,812
On the motion, and we'll get to discussion in a second, but on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to refer to Committee of the Whole, seconded by Councilor Sang.

382
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:22,592
We will first hear from the rest of members of the council if they'd like to speak on this.

383
00:47:23,873 --> 00:47:27,593
I'll say something quickly, and then we will hear from members of the public.

384
00:47:27,993 --> 00:47:34,235
And just a reminder to members of the public, you can speak either here in person or on Zoom, and you'll have three minutes.

385
00:47:34,315 --> 00:47:36,055
But first, we're gonna go to members of the council.

386
00:47:36,155 --> 00:47:36,755
Councilor Sang.

387
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:43,013
I want to thank you and applaud you for your leadership on this issue, Councilor Scarpelli.

388
00:47:45,434 --> 00:47:47,015
Don't apologize for your emotion, I think.

389
00:47:48,156 --> 00:48:01,023
It really brings to light the significance of why this is important for our city and important for the council to get involved and be talking about making sure that we are all communicating with each other on such a profound change like this.

390
00:48:02,124 --> 00:48:03,725
And I think your story is

391
00:48:04,707 --> 00:48:06,068
was profoundly touching.

392
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:25,177
I think it's a story that a lot of our residents know, see every single day, have lived, and, you know, through the last few decades as well, through the, I think, really top-notch and faithful service that Armstrong has given to this city.

393
00:48:27,658 --> 00:48:47,289
I think moving to executive, to committee of the whole and then possibly to executive session if that's allowed will be really important for us to speak in more depth and in more, more freely about this, about the issue.

394
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:53,473
I've certainly in talking to you, in talking to residents,

395
00:48:54,673 --> 00:48:57,356
have questions about the change.

396
00:48:58,016 --> 00:49:02,301
I mean, the first one you brought up, what does this transition look like?

397
00:49:02,341 --> 00:49:03,182
Are we ready for it?

398
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:07,526
Are our first responders ready for this change?

399
00:49:08,928 --> 00:49:11,190
What does that look like and what should residents expect?

400
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:16,696
I think that's a baseline question we need to answer with any large shift like this.

401
00:49:18,797 --> 00:49:25,960
I think in addition to that, I mean, I would ask why we made the change and what the process was behind it.

402
00:49:27,361 --> 00:49:35,385
I think there are a lot of residents, as you kind of alluded to, that have brought up important critiques, concerns, questions.

403
00:49:36,025 --> 00:49:42,328
And at the very least, the role of city government, if we've taken any lesson from the last few months, is to explain

404
00:49:43,168 --> 00:49:52,115
large changes like this better to a resident so that everyone has as full of a picture as, you know, as we all deserve.

405
00:49:53,656 --> 00:49:59,421
You know, I think residents have brought up things like, you know, have we compared response times?

406
00:50:01,102 --> 00:50:06,426
If there was a problem with the service before, what did we do wrong?

407
00:50:06,726 --> 00:50:08,308
What did, was it fixed?

408
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:11,420
where there are offers for those problems to be fixed.

409
00:50:12,901 --> 00:50:23,565
Residents have brought up union issues as well, and I think it's important for this council to stand by working folks and union leadership.

410
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:43,333
We've talked about, I think, the rates of mutual aid between companies, what the behavior bus actually looks like, whether that benefit is something that can be done with Armstrong, as you talked to.

411
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:53,437
And I think there are larger structural questions, too, outside of just the ambulance issue that we've seen over the last few months.

412
00:50:54,072 --> 00:51:06,955
where I think the state law and the charter are really clear about who is the person, who is the individual in the city, who is responsible for entering and negotiating contracts.

413
00:51:07,495 --> 00:51:18,237
But I think there are structural questions that perhaps have to come in a few years when we review the charter, when we look at the council's ability, the balance of power between different offices in the city about

414
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:24,033
that ability to enter and negotiate contracts and exit contracts as well.

415
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:34,042
But I think we'll have time in the committee as a whole to talk more about these issues, to talk more deeply about these issues as well.

416
00:51:35,082 --> 00:51:38,505
But just for today, I'm very happy to support this motion.

417
00:51:41,648 --> 00:51:42,049
Thank you.

418
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:45,091
Any other members of the council want to speak to this paper at this time?

419
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:45,792
Councilor Lemming.

420
00:51:47,923 --> 00:52:00,827
I would just like to thank my colleague for thoroughly doing his research on this and sharing his own story of why this matters so much.

421
00:52:02,307 --> 00:52:06,628
Just to voice my own opinions on this, this is a resolution that I support.

422
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:17,071
I think at the very least, residents would like clarity on the back and forth, what exactly happened and what the real world impacts of this will be.

423
00:52:18,085 --> 00:52:24,947
I think Committee of the Whole with a possible executive session is the perfect forum to do that.

424
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:40,873
I look forward to hearing folks speak about this issue, to hear from the many folks who, from the many EMS workers that we have in the room tonight who would be interested, who would offer their perspectives on this.

425
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:58,513
I hope that this body can be useful in at least clarifying the reasons behind this change, because a lot of residents have been reaching out to us and are clearly very dissatisfied with it.

426
00:52:58,573 --> 00:53:01,734
So thank you once again for bringing this forward.

427
00:53:07,205 --> 00:53:15,267
Seeing no further councilors want to speak to this at this time, I'll just be brief about my viewpoint on this.

428
00:53:16,147 --> 00:53:28,090
I think when we talk about our ambulance contract, we're talking about residents wanting to trust that if they get sick or if they get hurt,

429
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:42,433
there will be an EMT and an ambulance at their door or at the scene of a collision or at the scene of an incident quickly so that they can get the help that they need.

430
00:53:43,614 --> 00:53:49,618
It's one of the things that is one of the most essential functions of government, right?

431
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:54,843
Making sure that if something goes wrong, there's someone there to keep folks safe.

432
00:53:55,843 --> 00:53:57,685
And I think when it comes to this contract,

433
00:53:59,241 --> 00:54:23,533
When you've been working with a group, a company for over 20 years, when there's been relationships built between those EMS folks and your police and your fire department, I would ask, and I would wanna know, and those are the questions that I'm asking, why change and why and how will residents be safer if we change?

434
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,421
And that isn't clear to me.

435
00:54:26,601 --> 00:54:38,444
You know, I also have had a chance to speak with the mayor and our fire chief and our police chief, with Councilor Scarpelli, with some folks from Armstrong.

436
00:54:39,204 --> 00:54:41,065
And, you know, it's not clear to me.

437
00:54:41,105 --> 00:54:44,186
I've heard a couple of stories of things that happened that I don't like.

438
00:54:44,886 --> 00:54:45,806
I raised those with Armstrong.

439
00:54:45,826 --> 00:54:46,967
They said we didn't like that either.

440
00:54:48,347 --> 00:54:49,147
We made a mistake.

441
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:53,649
And I just ask, you know, I think the answers that I'm hoping to find are,

442
00:54:54,482 --> 00:54:57,003
Why does the change make our city safer?

443
00:54:57,883 --> 00:55:09,427
And if we can get answers to that question and, you know, the experts believe that a change is going to make people safer and the mayor's, and that's the mayor's decision, well then that's the mayor's decision.

444
00:55:09,847 --> 00:55:15,708
But I just think that this council and the residents deserve clear answers to that question and I don't have them yet.

445
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:18,349
So I want to hear from everybody.

446
00:55:18,629 --> 00:55:19,590
I want to understand.

447
00:55:22,182 --> 00:55:24,963
how and why this change is going to make our city safer.

448
00:55:25,483 --> 00:55:39,988
And I think if there were things outside of that scope, outside of the scope of making us safer that were a factor here, I want to understand why we couldn't get to yes on those questions that were outside of that core public safety role in this contract.

449
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,721
So that's just where I'm coming from on this.

450
00:55:43,761 --> 00:55:47,344
I appreciate Councilor Scarpelli, my colleagues and their thoughts on this.

451
00:55:48,545 --> 00:56:07,501
And I will, pending an approval of this motion, work to schedule a committee of the whole with our chiefs, with the mayor's office, see if we can, if an executive session exemption around contracts would apply here considering that a contract signed.

452
00:56:09,515 --> 00:56:14,576
And my goal is to have that meeting next Tuesday before the changeover in a couple of weeks.

453
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:17,857
So, Councilor Scarpell, yes.

454
00:56:18,937 --> 00:56:25,158
Can we make sure that everybody that was part of the negotiation process is present?

455
00:56:25,178 --> 00:56:25,398
Yes.

456
00:56:25,418 --> 00:56:26,138
I think that's important.

457
00:56:26,158 --> 00:56:26,678
Yes, sure.

458
00:56:26,698 --> 00:56:27,398
Thank you.

459
00:56:27,438 --> 00:56:35,980
We'll happily invite, you know, our current provider and the new provider if they'd like to attend as well, if that's great.

460
00:56:38,163 --> 00:56:43,245
So with that, if there's no other comments from members of the council, we'll open it up to members of the public either in person or on Zoom.

461
00:56:44,066 --> 00:56:48,509
You can line up behind the podium or raise your hand on Zoom and you'll have three minutes.

462
00:56:49,209 --> 00:56:51,590
Is there anyone who'd like to speak on this at this time?

463
00:56:57,414 --> 00:56:57,654
Great.

464
00:56:57,674 --> 00:56:58,554
Give me one second.

465
00:56:59,015 --> 00:56:59,415
Thank you.

466
00:57:07,086 --> 00:57:08,659
Sorry, it's just taking a minute here.

467
00:57:22,298 --> 00:57:22,538
All right.

468
00:57:22,738 --> 00:57:25,339
For some reason, I can't set the timer the way I usually do.

469
00:57:25,459 --> 00:57:27,100
So I will keep time on my phone.

470
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,061
I'm just going to read something really quick.

471
00:57:29,141 --> 00:57:30,821
I don't think it's going to be three minutes.

472
00:57:30,961 --> 00:57:31,181
Right.

473
00:57:31,221 --> 00:57:32,742
Floor is yours and you have three minutes.

474
00:57:32,762 --> 00:57:33,062
Thank you.

475
00:57:33,142 --> 00:57:33,442
Okay.

476
00:57:33,482 --> 00:57:34,603
My name's Nancy Campbell.

477
00:57:34,643 --> 00:57:36,483
I'm a business agent with Teamsters Local 25.

478
00:57:36,604 --> 00:57:41,665
I've been here before, so I recognize some of you.

479
00:57:43,006 --> 00:57:48,048
Our president at Local 25, Thomas Mowry, couldn't be here this evening, but he did put out

480
00:57:48,643 --> 00:57:49,724
He wanted a statement.

481
00:57:49,865 --> 00:57:54,310
I have a hard copy for all of you when I leave, but I wanted to read it into the record, okay?

482
00:57:54,671 --> 00:57:57,014
So this is from President Tom Mare.

483
00:57:58,633 --> 00:58:22,090
Medford City Council, Mayor Lungo, and concerned members of the Medford community, on behalf of more than 275 emergency medical services professionals represented by Teamsters Local 25, who have proudly served the City of Medford through Armstrong Ambulance for more than 30 years, we write to express our strong support for Armstrong Ambulance and to urge

484
00:58:23,448 --> 00:58:32,172
and to urge immediate reconsideration for the recent termination and reassignment of the city's EMS contract.

485
00:58:32,813 --> 00:58:48,821
For decades, Armstrong Ambulance has provided MedFed with reliable, high quality emergency medical services distinguished by strong clinical performance, operational consistency, and deep institutional knowledge of the community's need.

486
00:58:50,065 --> 00:58:55,870
Their record is well established and their workforce is experienced, professional and committed to public safety.

487
00:58:56,850 --> 00:59:11,582
At no point has the city identified any failure to any failure in clinical care, response, performance or operational capability that would justify removal of Armstrong as Medford EMS provider.

488
00:59:13,744 --> 00:59:32,609
Rather, the sequence of events strongly suggest that Armstrong's removal followed its discussion to raise legitimate concerns regarding contract payments and to insist appropriately that all actions comply with lawful and transparent process to protect both the city and the provider.

489
00:59:33,409 --> 00:59:41,671
In May, Armstrong engaged in good faith discussions with the city outside council, KP Law, regarding these payment concerns.

490
00:59:42,339 --> 00:59:48,745
After Armstrong's attorneys presented the issues, KP Law acknowledged and understood the concerns raised.

491
00:59:49,225 --> 01:00:09,182
Throughout negotiations from April through December, Armstrong consistently demonstrated flexibility and cooperation, agreeing in principle to the city's request terms for a new contract and repeatedly emphasized a willingness to say yes in order to preserve continuity of service.

492
01:00:10,063 --> 01:00:20,245
In late October, the city solicitor outside counsel, KP Law, the police chief and the fire chief met to discuss updated contract terms and legal safeguards.

493
01:00:20,685 --> 01:00:30,228
During that meeting, the city solicitor directly asked whether the police and fire chief supported Armstrong continuing as MedFed's EMS provider.

494
01:00:30,368 --> 01:00:35,909
Both chiefs unequivocally affirmed their support for maintaining the longstanding relationship.

495
01:00:36,729 --> 01:00:55,592
Armstrong left that meeting with a reasonable understanding that continuation of service was the expected outcome, reinforcing that understanding the city solicitor indicated his intention to recommend a five-year contract to the mayor and city council rather than a three-term contract.

496
01:00:56,713 --> 01:01:03,078
Instead, within weeks, the city solicitor was dismissed and the EMS contract was reassigned to a different provider.

497
01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:20,572
The timing and circumstances surrounding these actions raised serious concerns that the decision was motivated not by performance or public safety considerations, but by retaliation against Armstrong for insisting on proper legal and financial safeguards

498
01:01:21,132 --> 01:01:23,794
or for maintaining a unionized workforce.

499
01:01:24,295 --> 01:01:35,624
These concerns are further amplified by the Mayor's well-documented history of strained and noncollective relations with Teamsters Local 25 and other organized labor partners.

500
01:01:36,145 --> 01:01:40,048
The decision to replace a longstanding unionized EMS provider

501
01:01:40,548 --> 01:01:54,559
with a non-union company raises legitimate questions about whether labor considerations rather than service quality, workforce stability, or public safety played an improper role in the city's decision-making process.

502
01:01:55,319 --> 01:02:05,387
Such an approach risk undermines workforce morality, labor stability, and continuity of the experienced emergency care for Medford residents.

503
01:02:05,867 --> 01:02:07,869
This course of action is deeply troubling.

504
01:02:08,409 --> 01:02:24,775
It jeopardizes public safety, threatens the livelihoods and collective bargaining protections of dedicated EMS professionals, and undermines the public confidence in fairness and integrity for municipality decisionmaking.

505
01:02:25,155 --> 01:02:33,678
Most importantly, it disrupts the continuity of proven, competent emergency medical care for the residents of Medford.

506
01:02:35,839 --> 01:03:04,135
Accordingly, the Teamsters Local 25 respectfully call upon the Mayor and City Council to immediately pause the implementation of the new awarded EMS contract, reinstate Armstrong Ambulance as MedFed's EMS provider while a transparent and lawful review is conducted, ensure that all contract decisions are based on documented clinical, operational, and public safety criteria, not retaliation for seeking legal compliance

507
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:18,120
or labor representation, and engage in good faith negotiations with Armstrong Ambulance and Teamsters Local 25 to preserve jobs, protect public safety, and restore the community's trust.

508
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:31,365
Teamsters Local 25 and Armstrong Ambulance stand ready to work collaboratively with the city leadership to ensure that MedFed EMS services remain safe, reliable, and professionally managed.

509
01:03:32,065 --> 01:03:44,150
removing a highly qualified and longstanding provider for reasons unrelated to performance, places a community at unreasonable risk, and erodes confidence in public governance.

510
01:03:44,650 --> 01:03:46,171
Sincerely, Thomas G. Maury.

511
01:03:47,331 --> 01:03:47,792
Thank you.

512
01:03:58,276 --> 01:04:00,337
Could we have a copy of the letter just for the record, please?

513
01:04:01,387 --> 01:04:01,988
Oh, you left one?

514
01:04:02,188 --> 01:04:02,408
Great.

515
01:04:02,669 --> 01:04:03,310
Thank you so much.

516
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:06,033
Is there anyone else who'd like to speak on this issue?

517
01:04:06,253 --> 01:04:06,454
Great.

518
01:04:06,954 --> 01:04:08,616
Seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll stay at the podium.

519
01:04:09,077 --> 01:04:10,959
That was a bit longer than three minutes.

520
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,142
If we can try to stick to it, I'd appreciate it.

521
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:13,743
Thank you very much.

522
01:04:15,432 --> 01:04:18,553
Good evening, Rich Raymond, CEO with Armstrong Ambulance.

523
01:04:19,053 --> 01:04:20,513
Thank you all for seeing us tonight.

524
01:04:21,514 --> 01:04:22,834
I will not go into three minutes.

525
01:04:23,014 --> 01:04:25,455
I think what Nancy said was spot on.

526
01:04:26,415 --> 01:04:30,196
I just want to agree with what she read was really the way we feel.

527
01:04:30,956 --> 01:04:35,157
And it's a great relationship between Armstrong and the Teamsters.

528
01:04:35,658 --> 01:04:37,838
They've been very much part of this whole program.

529
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,619
I want to thank that relationship with them.

530
01:04:41,927 --> 01:04:44,249
And I also just want to thank the city.

531
01:04:45,249 --> 01:04:48,891
We're not here to put any stress on anyone.

532
01:04:49,812 --> 01:04:58,137
We just want to clarify some of the misunderstandings that we've seen on the social media and the presses and all that.

533
01:04:58,297 --> 01:05:02,379
This has been a pretty open meeting that we've had since April when this started.

534
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,681
Countless Zooms and meetings.

535
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:08,643
to get to where we thought we were gonna get to a new contract.

536
01:05:09,283 --> 01:05:14,686
And that time back in October with the city solicitor, Kevin Foley at the time, he agreed.

537
01:05:15,466 --> 01:05:20,149
He wanted to present a five year, and I guess you all have to sign off to go from a three year to a five year.

538
01:05:21,029 --> 01:05:24,691
He was gonna make that motion that he agreed that Armstrong.

539
01:05:24,751 --> 01:05:28,753
So when we got into the first week of November, I thought we had the contract.

540
01:05:29,421 --> 01:05:34,566
And then I sent an email out on December 12th asking, you know, how do we meet up?

541
01:05:34,646 --> 01:05:35,546
When do we sign this?

542
01:05:35,606 --> 01:05:37,848
I'd like to get this completed before the new year.

543
01:05:38,829 --> 01:05:42,252
That's when I got an email back saying that the city was going to go in a different direction.

544
01:05:43,613 --> 01:05:44,694
And that was about it.

545
01:05:45,135 --> 01:05:48,017
I sent a couple other follow-up emails without any response.

546
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:52,401
And I just don't understand with the impeccable record

547
01:05:52,955 --> 01:05:58,457
with the women and men here they've been doing great work for the city for years and years and years.

548
01:05:59,138 --> 01:06:05,780
Honestly I started in Medford as an EMT back in 1992 and I worked my way up to be the CEO of the company.

549
01:06:07,001 --> 01:06:09,362
But we know the city better than anyone.

550
01:06:09,582 --> 01:06:13,464
We know the intricacies we know the response patterns we know where the

551
01:06:15,246 --> 01:06:20,772
The time of day when we're going to see clusters of calls, we move assets or ambulances in to cover all of those.

552
01:06:21,233 --> 01:06:24,877
And this is institutional knowledge that we develop over 30 years of time.

553
01:06:25,818 --> 01:06:29,362
And I speak ill of no other company, I just know that.

554
01:06:30,188 --> 01:06:33,990
we do it better, and we have the men and women here to do it better.

555
01:06:34,671 --> 01:06:51,741
They are wonderful, they are committed, and we would offer our services to come and sit with you to discuss anything that we've done in the past, all the meetings we've been to, all the discussions we've had, all of the, what I would say,

556
01:06:53,216 --> 01:06:53,756
Great meetings.

557
01:06:53,796 --> 01:07:01,179
We thought we were working through everything and then at the 13th hour all of a sudden something shifted and we were no longer the provider.

558
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:04,660
We have a four and a half minute response pattern.

559
01:07:05,261 --> 01:07:10,623
We can have you know 30 ambulances in the city at any given time and we've done that day over day.

560
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:13,284
And I think that's what makes Armstrong unique.

561
01:07:14,064 --> 01:07:15,525
Our footprint is Medford.

562
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:17,725
We cover the surrounding communities.

563
01:07:18,346 --> 01:07:19,646
We don't go beyond that.

564
01:07:20,547 --> 01:07:21,447
Other companies have

565
01:07:22,514 --> 01:07:23,975
contracts all over the state.

566
01:07:24,595 --> 01:07:25,896
We are really right here.

567
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:27,917
All of our ambulances are in Medford.

568
01:07:27,957 --> 01:07:35,460
So to move 40 ambulances into Medford during a mass casualty incident or just a busy call volume, we do that.

569
01:07:35,701 --> 01:07:37,481
We don't use mutual aid.

570
01:07:37,521 --> 01:07:41,343
I think we captured 99.9% of all the calls.

571
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:43,684
And we have a four and a half minute response time.

572
01:07:44,245 --> 01:07:45,525
Are there mistakes every now and again?

573
01:07:46,006 --> 01:07:46,226
Sure.

574
01:07:46,666 --> 01:07:48,327
But four and a half minute response time.

575
01:07:48,827 --> 01:07:49,948
The national average is 8.59.

576
01:07:51,728 --> 01:07:57,589
and American Heart Association will always tell you, every minute that you don't have paramedics at your bedside.

577
01:07:58,478 --> 01:08:02,260
when you're in an active cardiac event, you lose 10% chance of life.

578
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:11,824
So if we're gonna go from a four and a half minute response and maybe the new company creeps up because they don't have all the surrounding ambulances like we do, there's gonna be concerns there.

579
01:08:12,344 --> 01:08:22,408
But I just, from our perspective, there's no other company that can really cover MedFed the way it needs to be wrapped, and we provide that.

580
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,981
And if there's going to be meetings we're happy to come and talk.

581
01:08:26,081 --> 01:08:35,082
And I just I feel I feel that the folks here with us they work so hard for the city and I want to thank them for being here tonight.

582
01:08:35,563 --> 01:08:37,163
I didn't think anybody was going to come.

583
01:08:37,223 --> 01:08:37,943
So thank you.

584
01:08:38,723 --> 01:08:41,424
But we really would love to be part of the city again.

585
01:08:41,444 --> 01:08:46,665
It would be no problem for us if you said it's a go.

586
01:08:46,765 --> 01:08:47,605
We're happy to do it.

587
01:08:47,685 --> 01:08:48,465
No harm no foul.

588
01:08:48,505 --> 01:08:49,145
We're here for you.

589
01:08:49,565 --> 01:08:50,546
We're not leaving the city.

590
01:08:50,686 --> 01:08:51,846
We're keeping the ambulance bay.

591
01:08:52,866 --> 01:08:56,249
If anything happens we'll always be here for you guys so really appreciate your time.

592
01:08:57,530 --> 01:08:57,810
Thank you.

593
01:08:58,591 --> 01:08:59,812
Madam Chief of Staff sure.

594
01:08:59,832 --> 01:09:00,553
Go ahead.

595
01:09:11,217 --> 01:09:12,117
Thank you, President Behrs.

596
01:09:12,677 --> 01:09:21,080
I want to start off by thanking Armstrong Ambulance because I think it's important to acknowledge the work and service that they provided the city for over 20 years.

597
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:28,722
The staff that did all that work to provide the city the services and the safety and support to our residents.

598
01:09:29,602 --> 01:09:33,143
It's not a short period of time and it doesn't go unnoticed.

599
01:09:33,263 --> 01:09:34,983
So I want to start off by saying that.

600
01:09:38,245 --> 01:09:45,235
to all the first responders here, the ALS providers and the BLS providers, thank you very much for what you do.

601
01:09:45,415 --> 01:09:46,837
I honestly couldn't do it myself.

602
01:09:47,598 --> 01:09:54,568
It's not a role I could play, so I can appreciate the complexity and the challenges of the work that they do because, you know,

603
01:09:55,088 --> 01:09:57,169
Some of us are not built that way, and I'm one of those people.

604
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:10,074
That said, I want to mention that we have our fire chief here today, our chief of police here today, our emergency services, our dispatch director, Mike Salve, here today.

605
01:10:10,634 --> 01:10:19,898
And, you know, that group negotiated a contract between two parties, between Armstrong Ambulance working

606
01:10:20,558 --> 01:10:25,820
in good faith negotiations with Armstrong Ambulance and in good faith negotiations with Cataldo.

607
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:36,364
I will certainly defer to any of the directors and chiefs that we have here today on the matter, but we were working on response time, staffing,

608
01:10:38,365 --> 01:10:50,949
investment support and contractual obligations and contractual things that were to be provided or could be provided in those negotiations all throughout in good faith with both parties.

609
01:10:51,029 --> 01:10:59,672
So, you know, I do want to try to avoid going down a rabbit hole of issues that the city has experienced because I think

610
01:11:00,532 --> 01:11:06,176
By and large, there's been an incredible support and I think it's important to kind of leave it there.

611
01:11:06,236 --> 01:11:08,157
So I'm hoping we can do that as a group.

612
01:11:09,338 --> 01:11:11,059
But I think that's up to the council really.

613
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:18,825
So I defer to any of the personnel and directors and department heads we have here today.

614
01:11:19,065 --> 01:11:21,146
And Chief, I know he has a couple of comments.

615
01:11:21,186 --> 01:11:21,546
Thank you.

616
01:11:22,407 --> 01:11:22,927
Thank you.

617
01:11:23,548 --> 01:11:29,212
And just before we hear from the Chief, I think for me, the fundamental question is, at least from my perspective,

618
01:11:30,337 --> 01:11:34,702
Why does this new contract make the city safer than the contract we had before.

619
01:11:35,162 --> 01:11:38,305
Like that's the question that I want to understand better.

620
01:11:39,567 --> 01:11:49,597
And to your point Madam Chief of Staff something that you know I know the mayor has written an email you just said was you know we don't want to go down the rabbit hole we don't want to bring up the issues.

621
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:55,624
I think, you know, I spoke with Rich Raymond and he said, whatever the issues are, let's put them on the table.

622
01:11:56,044 --> 01:11:58,745
And I think like that honesty, let's just put it out there.

623
01:11:58,845 --> 01:12:01,326
I want to understand why we're making the decision we're making.

624
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:06,669
And if that means putting out things that feel difficult to say, I think that's okay.

625
01:12:07,129 --> 01:12:08,930
That honesty I think is really important.

626
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:16,273
That helps to me, that honesty will help me understand the answer to that question of why this decision makes the city safer.

627
01:12:16,453 --> 01:12:17,654
So that's just my perspective.

628
01:12:18,242 --> 01:12:31,905
I'll turn it over to Chief Evans and, you know, we can talk about the honest truth as everyone sees it and also just want to note we have a chance next week and this is a pitch for our committee structure that we've been working on for two years.

629
01:12:31,925 --> 01:12:34,385
You know, these meetings have 5, 10, 15 things on them.

630
01:12:34,885 --> 01:12:38,146
Next week we can have a meeting just about this, go into the details.

631
01:12:38,226 --> 01:12:44,907
So if, you know, we'll have everybody back, we can answer some of the more detailed questions but the floor is yours, Chief Evans.

632
01:12:46,386 --> 01:12:53,210
I've worked with Armstrong staff for the last 24 years, so I'm not here to say anything disparaging about Armstrong.

633
01:12:53,370 --> 01:13:00,014
I've worked closely with them, and I still maintain their relationship with Armstrong, and I appreciate everything that they've done for the city.

634
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:08,659
But, you know, saying that the city is less safe at this point, I mean, the fire department responds immediately to every medical also.

635
01:13:08,779 --> 01:13:12,321
We're the first ones rolling out the door, and we're getting right to these responses.

636
01:13:14,372 --> 01:13:16,492
just saying that the city is less safe right off the bat.

637
01:13:16,552 --> 01:13:20,893
I mean, we're responding to these calls also.

638
01:13:20,933 --> 01:13:21,573
I want to be clear.

639
01:13:21,633 --> 01:13:22,834
I wasn't saying the city is less safe.

640
01:13:23,234 --> 01:13:26,934
I, you know, I want to understand how we're even safer with the new choice.

641
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:27,574
That's all I'm saying.

642
01:13:27,674 --> 01:13:33,215
So you're getting, I mean, you're still getting paramedic vehicles.

643
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:35,756
You're getting BLS vehicles in this contract also.

644
01:13:36,136 --> 01:13:38,376
You're getting paramedic fly car.

645
01:13:39,497 --> 01:13:41,857
So you're still set up the same way.

646
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:44,706
as Armstrong was set up here.

647
01:13:45,186 --> 01:13:53,051
So you're not setting up in a less way as far as vehicles coming here, all right?

648
01:13:53,371 --> 01:13:55,613
So you're getting the same response.

649
01:13:56,994 --> 01:14:02,237
As far as I've been told by Cataldo, I have no reason to see them lying to me.

650
01:14:03,738 --> 01:14:11,143
They're adamant that they are able to take care of Medford's needs and respond quickly and get to these calls just like

651
01:14:12,192 --> 01:14:39,689
anybody else, so we have reassurances from Cataldo, President Dennis, and management there, and we've discussed this with them also, and so, I mean, I can't, I gotta take their word for it also, so there's another side to the story also, and again, I'm not gonna disparage Armstrong at all and get into anything like that, because as far as I can tell, I mean,

652
01:14:40,875 --> 01:14:44,977
Armstrong says that they're staying here in their base here, so they're going to be nearby also.

653
01:14:46,598 --> 01:14:52,202
And I wouldn't want to see anybody burning any bridges as far as the relationship goes.

654
01:14:52,802 --> 01:14:55,243
So I expect a smooth transition.

655
01:14:56,064 --> 01:14:57,885
Everybody's being professional about this.

656
01:14:59,886 --> 01:15:03,788
And we're going to make the change on the 19th as it's anticipated.

657
01:15:07,910 --> 01:15:12,152
Again, we're working closely with Armstrong with that also during the transition.

658
01:15:14,353 --> 01:15:24,658
And we'll continue to maintain contact with Armstrong as far as professional relationship with them and maintain that close relationship with them.

659
01:15:25,138 --> 01:15:28,120
I mean, we're going to keep on communicating with them also.

660
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:43,384
And I don't see Armstrong saying no to, you know, passing along information that we need from them as far as our previous contact with, you know, the, like they said, that they know Medford.

661
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:44,944
They stated that.

662
01:15:45,085 --> 01:15:51,367
And I've never seen them refuse to assist in some way like that.

663
01:15:51,467 --> 01:15:54,908
I mean, they would provide me information on particular cases and things like that.

664
01:15:54,928 --> 01:16:00,330
So I'm sure I can continue to reach out for them if I have any questions going forward with the,

665
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:02,903
with the new service if need be.

666
01:16:03,703 --> 01:16:11,066
And obviously we're going to keep a close eye on the new service provider going forward and look at the data and everything else.

667
01:16:11,086 --> 01:16:25,592
And in the contract, I mean there's clauses in there also to void the contract if need be if they were not able to live up to any service needs.

668
01:16:29,768 --> 01:16:30,428
Thank you, Chief.

669
01:16:30,528 --> 01:16:32,750
Madam Chief of Staff, and then I'm going to go to Councilor Scarpelli.

670
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:33,431
Thank you very much.

671
01:16:33,511 --> 01:16:38,035
I think it's also really important to say that these kinds of things do happen in communities.

672
01:16:38,175 --> 01:16:42,520
It's not uncommon for communities to look at alternative solutions for delivery.

673
01:16:43,380 --> 01:16:49,666
It's also not uncommon for communities to consider, you know, multiple vendors for something.

674
01:16:49,826 --> 01:16:52,409
As we all know, there's a process for that.

675
01:16:54,913 --> 01:17:16,217
I honestly think that while there are some questions and hopefully we can get some of those questions answered, I think carrying this conversation on to a degree is only potentially going to create concern and fear when the fact of the matter is the team that I mentioned a moment ago has been working hard to ensure smooth transition.

676
01:17:16,777 --> 01:17:21,518
Our chiefs and our dispatch supervisor have been working very diligently on that.

677
01:17:22,699 --> 01:17:26,242
And so we need to invest time and energy into doing that.

678
01:17:26,682 --> 01:17:31,226
That's what's the most important in all of this, in my opinion, and continue to invest that time and energy.

679
01:17:31,987 --> 01:17:44,298
So I would hope that we can answer the questions today and move on from the conversation and not continue this and continue to create concern in people's minds because there is a solid contract.

680
01:17:44,999 --> 01:17:50,226
that is coming into place, just like there is a solid contract in at least six other major communities.

681
01:17:50,406 --> 01:17:57,655
As far as I know, Lynn, Malden, Everett, Chelsea, Revere, and Somerville all are served by Cataldo.

682
01:17:57,876 --> 01:18:02,642
So I think it's important for us to understand and realize as a part of this conversation that

683
01:18:03,062 --> 01:18:11,869
We are all working diligently to ensure a smooth transition, and you have some of the most well-respected chiefs and dispatch supervisor in the area and the region.

684
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:26,641
I can't speak to outside the state, but I can certainly say that our department heads are very capable and very competent, and they have done nothing but try to provide the best service and best solutions for the city as a part of this process.

685
01:18:27,922 --> 01:18:33,786
Hopefully we can get the questions answered today and move on because I think that this contract, this conversation doesn't need to be protracted.

686
01:18:33,826 --> 01:18:36,408
And it's, it's not gonna probably help the community if it is protracted.

687
01:18:37,928 --> 01:18:38,249
Thank you.

688
01:18:38,269 --> 01:18:42,931
I'm gonna go to Councilor Scarpelli to meet him and I'm Chief of Staff, but I just still don't understand why.

689
01:18:43,072 --> 01:18:48,195
And I don't think anyone's questioning the competence of Chief Buckley or Chief Evans to implement this transition.

690
01:18:48,215 --> 01:18:54,478
I think, I'll speak for myself, I just wanna understand why we're doing a transition.

691
01:18:54,819 --> 01:18:56,940
You know, why, why is this contract,

692
01:18:57,393 --> 01:18:58,815
better than the contract we had.

693
01:18:59,356 --> 01:19:01,859
Why is this provider better than the provider we had before.

694
01:19:02,600 --> 01:19:06,125
And you know that's the piece I don't understand.

695
01:19:06,906 --> 01:19:11,412
I don't think we have time to answer every question tonight because we have a lot of other stuff we have to do tonight.

696
01:19:12,453 --> 01:19:14,936
I think a decision of this magnitude deserves.

697
01:19:17,117 --> 01:19:19,338
dedicated focus and time at another meeting.

698
01:19:19,398 --> 01:19:26,342
I understand that that creates a burden of time where people have to come back and be in this chamber and work through it.

699
01:19:27,222 --> 01:19:33,225
And I do have just, I think, something, kind of a question here.

700
01:19:33,585 --> 01:19:37,947
My understanding, and, you know, there's kind of been back and forth about this in the various discussions.

701
01:19:40,235 --> 01:19:41,576
on the process itself, right?

702
01:19:41,636 --> 01:19:43,838
You know, you talked about the process to do a contract.

703
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:47,800
In this case, this was not a 30B procurement, right?

704
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:53,905
Like we didn't solicit bids because the city doesn't pay the service provider, right?

705
01:19:53,965 --> 01:20:04,492
If you could just go quickly into that part of the process, I think that might be helpful for people to understand too because my understanding is it's not the traditional, it's not because there's no payment by the city, the city's not paying anybody.

706
01:20:04,952 --> 01:20:07,557
It's not the 30B bid process.

707
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:11,784
It's just the mayor's decision of what she believes to be in the best interest of the city.

708
01:20:12,204 --> 01:20:15,029
So if you could just clarify that, because I've seen a bunch of people saying, this wasn't done right.

709
01:20:15,069 --> 01:20:18,555
And at least we can maybe get that out of the way tonight, and then we can talk about the why.

710
01:20:19,134 --> 01:20:19,394
Sure.

711
01:20:19,734 --> 01:20:21,015
I'm happy to answer that, President Behrs.

712
01:20:21,715 --> 01:20:24,796
Succinctly, Chapter 30B exempts ambulance service providers.

713
01:20:25,297 --> 01:20:29,278
So there's no requirement to go through any procurement process.

714
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:41,383
But as one can imagine, it's almost a fiduciary responsibility and the responsibility of the organization to analyze the service that's being provided and what options exist out there.

715
01:20:41,443 --> 01:20:45,525
So while something may be exempted, it's not always something that you wouldn't

716
01:20:46,505 --> 01:20:48,427
necessarily just direct contract.

717
01:20:48,847 --> 01:21:08,404
You would, I mean, a good practice is to establish whether, review whether the existing contract you have, and this isn't about ambulance, this is about anything that might be exempt, evaluate the contract that exists and determine whether that's providing the services and support that the city is trying to secure.

718
01:21:09,044 --> 01:21:12,266
If it isn't, then potentially look at alternatives.

719
01:21:12,687 --> 01:21:21,313
In this case, we didn't abandon having conversations with Armstrong and go directly to one other vendor and have direct negotiations with that vendor or other vendors alone.

720
01:21:21,693 --> 01:21:23,754
We continued the negotiations with Armstrong.

721
01:21:24,835 --> 01:21:30,539
At a very high level, the city was experiencing some issues with the contract.

722
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:33,021
Armstrong wasn't necessarily,

723
01:21:34,502 --> 01:21:37,245
prepared to provide some of the terms of the contract.

724
01:21:37,365 --> 01:21:38,507
Again, we can get into that.

725
01:21:38,767 --> 01:21:42,191
I'm not sure that that's, well, the door's been opened.

726
01:21:42,211 --> 01:21:50,060
I don't know that there's closing that at this point, but my colleagues would know some of the more intricate details.

727
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:54,185
I could go into a high level, but that's one tier.

728
01:21:55,738 --> 01:21:57,018
Thank you and I appreciate that.

729
01:21:57,118 --> 01:22:09,941
And the word analyze you know that's I think for me what I just want to see the analysis you know what was the analysis of and how did the city team analyze the options and determine this to be the best option.

730
01:22:11,161 --> 01:22:11,801
I agree with you.

731
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:13,982
It's an open it opens a door.

732
01:22:14,442 --> 01:22:19,843
It seems to me that all parties are certainly you know I heard from the mayor in communication you know.

733
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:22,257
We don't want to put Armstrong out.

734
01:22:22,298 --> 01:22:25,480
We don't want that, you know, we don't, you know, we don't want to air anything that might hurt them.

735
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:26,681
I heard from Armstrong.

736
01:22:27,482 --> 01:22:28,482
Let's just put it out there.

737
01:22:28,983 --> 01:22:32,806
So I think that piece of it, you know, just putting those facts out there is fine.

738
01:22:32,826 --> 01:22:39,151
I do think we don't have time for all of it tonight to understand the analysis over six months of a complicated decision.

739
01:22:39,671 --> 01:22:40,932
So I appreciate that.

740
01:22:41,413 --> 01:22:46,777
I understand, you know, having another meeting does add some additional work to the process.

741
01:22:48,418 --> 01:22:51,860
Personally, I believe that's worth the time.

742
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:54,241
That's my two cents.

743
01:22:54,441 --> 01:22:56,922
I'll probably try to not say anything for the rest of this resolution.

744
01:22:57,662 --> 01:23:02,445
Councilor Scarpelli, I know you had your, you had a request to speak, so Councilor Scarpelli.

745
01:23:02,465 --> 01:23:03,725
Thank you, Mr. President.

746
01:23:03,825 --> 01:23:04,666
To the Chief of Staff,

747
01:23:05,661 --> 01:23:15,024
I understand how it's uncomfortable, but the bottom line is I think people are more frightened if we don't come to some resolution and understand how this process went on.

748
01:23:15,064 --> 01:23:18,725
Because again, the communication isn't going out correctly.

749
01:23:19,105 --> 01:23:20,786
The communication is scaring a lot of people.

750
01:23:21,666 --> 01:23:23,806
But I want to revert back to what Chief Evans said.

751
01:23:24,547 --> 01:23:30,549
Chief Evans, you said, and this is where I'm a little perplexed, Armstrong's great.

752
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:31,649
Armstrong's here.

753
01:23:32,029 --> 01:23:35,190
Armstrong's been A, B, and C. Then why did you change him?

754
01:23:36,255 --> 01:23:37,396
These are the things we're gonna get into.

755
01:23:37,876 --> 01:23:39,277
The other pieces that we talked about.

756
01:23:39,998 --> 01:23:43,200
I trust our leadership team like no other.

757
01:23:44,021 --> 01:23:46,523
But I did my homework and our chiefs did their homework.

758
01:23:47,384 --> 01:23:52,147
And I'm sure that this is why going down that rabbit hole tonight is a mistake.

759
01:23:52,768 --> 01:24:01,955
And these are things we'll talk about next week because possibly chiefs from other neighbor communities that spoke with me openly can share

760
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:17,295
the fear that they had for their communities and what can happen here in Medford, because people that you said to yourself, Chief, people you respect, shared their opinions on what was promised and what was followed through.

761
01:24:19,417 --> 01:24:21,759
And again, you already said it.

762
01:24:22,179 --> 01:24:23,019
They're already doing it.

763
01:24:24,521 --> 01:24:25,501
Council Beers has said it.

764
01:24:25,541 --> 01:24:27,443
These are the issues that we need to know why.

765
01:24:28,944 --> 01:24:30,005
Why did we do this?

766
01:24:31,165 --> 01:24:32,767
Because I heard each of you separately.

767
01:24:33,962 --> 01:24:34,983
I listened to everybody.

768
01:24:35,883 --> 01:24:37,605
I listened to chiefs in neighboring communities.

769
01:24:37,905 --> 01:24:39,266
I listened to their processes.

770
01:24:41,787 --> 01:24:42,728
I shared those with you.

771
01:24:44,229 --> 01:24:45,149
I came back to you.

772
01:24:45,249 --> 01:24:46,490
I listened to Armstrong.

773
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:47,871
I heard what they said.

774
01:24:49,232 --> 01:24:53,415
And we can go down that rabbit hole because the behavior bust from what I hear is based out of Lynn.

775
01:24:54,816 --> 01:25:01,180
Conversation we had in Medford was that we were trying to do one here, but it fell through.

776
01:25:02,967 --> 01:25:10,449
We can go on and on and understand the process of making sure, are they prepared on the other side?

777
01:25:11,469 --> 01:25:19,670
I'll give you one example that I think we all know and fear, because this is one situation that really stuck with me.

778
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:32,313
I spoke to a neighboring community chief, and he expressed a situation that was very public about a young person that was struck by a car in a neighboring community.

779
01:25:34,155 --> 01:25:40,159
In the response time, within minutes, two ambulance and leadership team from Armstrong were at the scene.

780
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:47,683
Two capable paramedics, which, by the way, are PAL certified.

781
01:25:47,744 --> 01:25:50,085
That is Pediatric Advanced Life Support certified.

782
01:25:52,126 --> 01:25:53,967
They worked to save this young man's life.

783
01:25:55,548 --> 01:26:02,633
That chief told me that a firefighter jumped right in that seat, and they drove that ambulance while both paramedics, both EMTs, worked on that young person.

784
01:26:03,595 --> 01:26:04,935
And unfortunately, we couldn't save them.

785
01:26:07,776 --> 01:26:15,397
But the questions I have, do our partners that are coming in, are they PAL certified?

786
01:26:16,017 --> 01:26:20,918
Do they all have the certifications that I have in front of me that our friends behind you have?

787
01:26:21,578 --> 01:26:23,419
Like I said, I didn't want to go down this rabbit hole.

788
01:26:24,939 --> 01:26:29,620
But when you come up here and you say why, and then let's get things through this, this is the fundamental problem we're having here.

789
01:26:30,733 --> 01:26:41,499
We need to sit down at the table, and that's all I ask for, to sit down at the table one last time, talk to each other, go through the process with apples to apples, and understand the process.

790
01:26:41,519 --> 01:26:45,062
Because I have shared information.

791
01:26:46,082 --> 01:26:48,724
I have information that shows that these processes were in place.

792
01:26:50,531 --> 01:26:52,292
We talked about response time, right?

793
01:26:52,313 --> 01:27:00,519
We talked about, I keep forgetting the EDT, I keep making a mistake with the response time when 911 gets the call.

794
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,122
And we shift that over to Armstrong.

795
01:27:04,182 --> 01:27:09,547
And Armstrong gets on and they work with that person, providing life-saving action.

796
01:27:11,425 --> 01:27:13,547
and understanding, because that was one of the things we brought up.

797
01:27:14,487 --> 01:27:15,849
And I sat with Armstrong.

798
01:27:15,869 --> 01:27:16,749
They explained that to me.

799
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:21,813
And then I talked to our former chief, and then I talked to chiefs in neighbor communities, and they explained the process.

800
01:27:23,454 --> 01:27:25,176
And I said, where is the disconnect here?

801
01:27:27,470 --> 01:27:30,854
And then understand the process is important.

802
01:27:30,874 --> 01:27:38,362
That's why I don't want to keep going down this because I have a list of processes that I want to show and I need some answers for.

803
01:27:38,603 --> 01:27:39,804
I think the community deserves that.

804
01:27:40,345 --> 01:27:46,572
And then with that, we have possibly people that do work in neighboring communities that are willing to come and speak.

805
01:27:47,252 --> 01:27:51,173
because they feel that important about these issues.

806
01:27:51,233 --> 01:28:04,578
So, Mr. President, I would still move forward with a Committee of the Whole meeting, and we would love to have our professionals here to really put people at ease, because right now, people aren't at ease.

807
01:28:04,938 --> 01:28:06,338
Chief, understand something.

808
01:28:06,599 --> 01:28:11,980
There isn't a bigger, stronger advocate for our Medford firefighters and police department than me.

809
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:13,881
You know that, and that's public.

810
01:28:15,001 --> 01:28:16,562
That's not at all what I've said.

811
01:28:17,701 --> 01:28:28,278
But you know, as well as I do, when our firefighters get to a scene where there's a horrific incident, you talk to them, because they've told me themselves, as well as the PD.

812
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:36,816
That when they see Armstrong roll up, there's a sense of secureness that they feel, that there's a blanket of safeness around them.

813
01:28:37,316 --> 01:28:44,902
So that's, if it was put up in a way that was, maybe I might have said it saying that we don't have, we should be fearful of this, not at all.

814
01:28:45,363 --> 01:28:52,408
We know that our team is capable, but we also know that they're not prepared for some situations like the people that are trained are.

815
01:28:53,846 --> 01:28:56,328
I apologize if anybody feels uncomfortable.

816
01:28:56,588 --> 01:28:57,609
That's not what it's made for.

817
01:28:58,069 --> 01:28:59,450
I didn't do this for that reason.

818
01:29:00,071 --> 01:29:01,432
I did it for exactly what I said.

819
01:29:02,472 --> 01:29:03,373
This is personal to me.

820
01:29:10,925 --> 01:29:16,926
Everything you're describing, Counselor, again, you're talking about responses out the door, fire department's responding right out the door.

821
01:29:16,946 --> 01:29:20,147
You're talking about EMD, that's a dispatching thing.

822
01:29:20,227 --> 01:29:24,888
And again, our dispatchers immediately answer the call from citizens here, and they're dispatching it right to us.

823
01:29:24,948 --> 01:29:27,629
So we're going out the door right away, all right?

824
01:29:27,669 --> 01:29:29,629
So the speed is still going out the door.

825
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:31,289
We're still responding right away.

826
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:37,451
So I don't want you to give the impression that somehow the fire department is not responding

827
01:29:38,778 --> 01:29:40,039
people less safe because of this.

828
01:29:40,059 --> 01:29:48,007
If that's what the message of people feeling out there, that's not what I'm trying to say.

829
01:29:59,335 --> 01:30:01,077
I feel safe with our fire and police.

830
01:30:02,318 --> 01:30:04,461
We are not in any fear in that situation.

831
01:30:05,182 --> 01:30:13,193
But I think it's incumbent of us to understand that the next level, which is our ambulance provider, is that level.

832
01:30:13,593 --> 01:30:15,416
So I hope that's clear.

833
01:30:15,556 --> 01:30:16,878
I don't want anybody to think

834
01:30:17,218 --> 01:30:28,364
that we're in jeopardy or we should be in fear of our safety right now because there's a misconception that I might have said out there that the police and our first responders aren't capable.

835
01:30:28,584 --> 01:30:30,205
They're more than capable, believe me.

836
01:30:31,686 --> 01:30:33,827
So if that came out, Chief, I apologize.

837
01:30:33,847 --> 01:30:35,548
That's not the intention.

838
01:30:39,410 --> 01:30:40,950
Chief Buckley.

839
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:41,771
Medford Police, Chief Buckley.

840
01:30:42,631 --> 01:30:43,932
Thank you, Mr. President.

841
01:30:46,359 --> 01:31:02,432
I think it's sort of important that we could continue to sit here and say that, ask the question is the city safe, safer is what you're asking, not is the city safe, you're asking is the city safer as if there's some standard that we have to reach and then overcome.

842
01:31:03,433 --> 01:31:05,275
Or that it's the same level of safety.

843
01:31:06,176 --> 01:31:07,917
Maintain and improve, maintain or improve.

844
01:31:08,077 --> 01:31:12,040
And then to sort of, I'm gonna use the word backtrack, but I think you could,

845
01:31:12,899 --> 01:31:17,943
read this into it a little further, that you're not questioning public safety or the decisions of this public safety team.

846
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:20,705
I have over 30 years of public safety.

847
01:31:21,266 --> 01:31:24,789
I make decisions every single day for the safety of this city, right?

848
01:31:25,429 --> 01:31:31,094
I don't mind being questioned or have a conversation about that, but I had those conversations with city councilors.

849
01:31:31,814 --> 01:31:34,897
And it's still turning into a bit of a circus, right?

850
01:31:35,297 --> 01:31:38,720
There are issues with the

851
01:31:40,967 --> 01:31:48,809
The ambulance company, Armstrong Ambulance Company's ability or reasons that they wanted to up or did not want to uphold the prior contract.

852
01:31:49,310 --> 01:31:53,991
They also put terms before both chiefs of terms that they wanted to change.

853
01:31:54,571 --> 01:31:56,652
Terms that were going to cost this city money.

854
01:31:58,553 --> 01:32:06,575
It is responsible government for chiefs and for mayors and everybody else to review the process on ambulance companies.

855
01:32:07,735 --> 01:32:09,196
I think that process happened.

856
01:32:10,427 --> 01:32:20,680
I think some of what was said tonight is a misunderstanding or information was given to Armstrong Ambulance that is not accurate.

857
01:32:21,281 --> 01:32:28,390
I don't know where they got their source of some of the information, but I will tell you that over the last several years,

858
01:32:31,055 --> 01:32:38,041
in my eighth year now as chief, but definitely the last several, three to four years, we have had conversations with Armstrong Ambulance about their performance.

859
01:32:38,522 --> 01:32:47,310
I think every chief and every fire chief could say that they will have conversations about the performance of their ambulance companies and their AMS providers.

860
01:32:48,311 --> 01:32:49,412
We've worked through those.

861
01:32:49,532 --> 01:32:55,037
The problem is, is they continue, I'll leave it at that, they continue.

862
01:32:55,737 --> 01:32:57,259
Some of them are,

863
01:32:58,142 --> 01:32:58,982
Very problematic.

864
01:32:59,743 --> 01:33:02,124
Response times that are going into the 40 minute range.

865
01:33:03,364 --> 01:33:09,927
And there's a level of maybe not being upfront about that.

866
01:33:11,208 --> 01:33:20,511
I would rather work with a company that will, I'd rather explore other options with companies that will promise us that they will do better.

867
01:33:22,552 --> 01:33:24,113
And that's a little bit about what happened.

868
01:33:25,612 --> 01:33:30,455
I don't know that this has to be dragged out through the public to satisfy everybody's curiosity.

869
01:33:30,515 --> 01:33:41,663
I think at some point and level, you have to trust your public safety personnel or your leaders in public safety that they're making decisions on behalf of this city that are responsible and safe.

870
01:33:41,923 --> 01:33:42,844
This city is safe.

871
01:33:44,765 --> 01:33:45,326
End of story.

872
01:33:45,366 --> 01:33:48,068
Like if we transfer to Cataldo, we are safe.

873
01:33:48,828 --> 01:33:50,309
We are prepared for a transition.

874
01:33:50,349 --> 01:33:51,450
We are ready to go forward.

875
01:33:51,510 --> 01:33:52,811
We are getting more out of this.

876
01:33:55,008 --> 01:34:05,772
contract more ambulances, more committed ambulances, more training, a little bit of specialty services and behavioral support than we had prior to this.

877
01:34:08,853 --> 01:34:13,275
These are things that are smart decision making for leaders of this community to make.

878
01:34:15,135 --> 01:34:15,715
And we made them.

879
01:34:17,576 --> 01:34:21,838
We could go and drag everybody through the mud if we want to about poor decisions and poor,

880
01:34:24,331 --> 01:34:25,012
performances.

881
01:34:26,173 --> 01:34:35,619
But as this decision was made and as this gets dragged through the mud on social media or publicly, I'm hearing more and more about Armstrong Ambulance that is troubling to me that I didn't even know.

882
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:40,203
I'm not bringing that up because the decision was made prior to a lot of this.

883
01:34:41,724 --> 01:34:43,385
But I don't want to bad mouth anybody here.

884
01:34:43,605 --> 01:34:47,528
This is just leadership, making decisions on behalf of a community.

885
01:34:48,449 --> 01:34:52,792
And at some point in time, you have to trust the people you put in charge to make decisions.

886
01:34:53,848 --> 01:34:56,129
Again, I'm willing to talk about those issues.

887
01:34:56,309 --> 01:34:59,851
I can do it in a public safety subcommittee or whoever you want to do.

888
01:35:01,532 --> 01:35:11,357
But nobody's doing anything because we somehow got mad at the employees of Armstrong, or that we don't want to like Armstrong, or somebody promised us something.

889
01:35:11,797 --> 01:35:15,179
We're doing things responsibly on behalf of this city.

890
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:21,002
I really appreciate Councilor Scott Pelley's response to these talks to surrounding cities.

891
01:35:22,023 --> 01:35:24,485
And their chiefs, I have also.

892
01:35:26,167 --> 01:35:27,328
This chief also has.

893
01:35:29,289 --> 01:35:30,991
I haven't heard a bad thing about Cataldo.

894
01:35:45,923 --> 01:35:49,086
And this is my problem with holding, like again, you could call me a liar.

895
01:35:49,646 --> 01:35:50,287
I'm not a liar.

896
01:35:51,543 --> 01:35:55,708
I've got a long career and a reputation that says otherwise, that I am a liar.

897
01:35:57,651 --> 01:35:59,032
I didn't call you a liar, sir.

898
01:35:59,273 --> 01:36:01,896
I know, but this is the problem you have when you hold forums.

899
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:05,220
I get called a liar because I make a statement that somebody doesn't agree with.

900
01:36:05,921 --> 01:36:06,882
It's not a lie.

901
01:36:07,423 --> 01:36:08,063
I understand that.

902
01:36:11,088 --> 01:36:21,531
I think you've been in this room several times when people have called me a liar, or people have called George a liar, or people have called the chief of staff, or Chief Evans, or the mayor.

903
01:36:23,012 --> 01:36:25,572
Comes with the territory, and it sucks.

904
01:36:25,692 --> 01:36:26,533
I'm not going to say it.

905
01:36:26,573 --> 01:36:27,573
It doesn't feel good.

906
01:36:28,013 --> 01:36:28,373
I don't mind.

907
01:36:28,393 --> 01:36:29,473
I get thick skin.

908
01:36:29,554 --> 01:36:30,194
It doesn't bother me.

909
01:36:30,234 --> 01:36:30,574
No, I know.

910
01:36:30,634 --> 01:36:31,934
But I'm just, I know.

911
01:36:32,374 --> 01:36:33,635
I'm talking about the process.

912
01:36:33,735 --> 01:36:34,215
I understand.

913
01:36:34,235 --> 01:36:36,035
When you openly question decisions.

914
01:36:36,115 --> 01:36:37,656
Yeah, this is why we have one.

915
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:38,910
Is that me or you?

916
01:36:43,373 --> 01:36:46,836
We're making responsible decisions on behalf of this community.

917
01:36:48,357 --> 01:36:50,998
You could drag it through however you want, we'll be here to answer these questions.

918
01:36:51,318 --> 01:36:57,442
You could bring in whoever you want to sort of answer these questions also, right, or to call me a liar or tell us that this didn't happen.

919
01:36:58,203 --> 01:37:04,547
I'm not going to drag other chiefs into a community meeting to talk about their experiences because I've already talked to them.

920
01:37:04,847 --> 01:37:05,928
So you can take my word for it.

921
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:15,164
But there are performance issues with the upstrong ambulance, and there are contractual issues with the upstrong ambulance.

922
01:37:16,265 --> 01:37:20,248
If there weren't, there would not be a Cataldo ambulance brought into this process.

923
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,630
The city is safe and will remain safe.

924
01:37:24,951 --> 01:37:25,632
That's the end of the story.

925
01:37:26,492 --> 01:37:28,714
Thank you for allowing me to go beyond three minutes.

926
01:37:29,514 --> 01:37:31,856
Well, that, I just want to be clear about the three minutes.

927
01:37:31,876 --> 01:37:33,257
That applies to members of the public.

928
01:37:34,038 --> 01:37:34,858
Councillor Scarpelli.

929
01:37:36,139 --> 01:37:37,280
One second, Councillor Scarpelli.

930
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:38,581
I'm going to turn on your microphone.

931
01:37:39,617 --> 01:37:40,317
Councilor Scarpelli.

932
01:37:40,638 --> 01:37:43,959
There's undertones of people calling people liars.

933
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:45,901
We spoke.

934
01:37:47,942 --> 01:37:49,983
No, I get it, but we spoke, I'm saying.

935
01:37:50,003 --> 01:37:50,443
We spoke.

936
01:37:51,183 --> 01:37:53,865
And I trust you with everything you said.

937
01:37:54,926 --> 01:37:55,106
Right?

938
01:37:56,586 --> 01:38:00,809
I talked to the other side because I want to do my due diligence.

939
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:02,670
Armstrong.

940
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:08,133
And when Armstrong said everything that you told me that were concerning,

941
01:38:08,922 --> 01:38:18,427
and they had a response to it, even this 45-minute time, and had documentation and showed me the emails that they've had for the situation.

942
01:38:19,928 --> 01:38:27,372
Chief, that's why I asked for another meeting for everybody to sit at the table, because it seemed there was a disconnect.

943
01:38:27,472 --> 01:38:30,033
So this isn't a forum to play the gacha game.

944
01:38:31,114 --> 01:38:36,477
This is a forum to really enlighten people

945
01:38:37,637 --> 01:38:39,659
to what's really happening so we can correct it.

946
01:38:39,839 --> 01:38:47,547
It could be you're right in everything that we've gone through that what was stated was we know this, this and that.

947
01:38:49,318 --> 01:38:51,220
And that's why I wanted to go to executive session.

948
01:38:51,240 --> 01:38:58,165
That's why I want to go into meetings that we could speak more openly about this, where we could share information.

949
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:01,568
Because I personally, I've seen information from both sides.

950
01:39:02,109 --> 01:39:03,690
This is what was shared with other people.

951
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:08,194
So it's something that is alarming to me and alarming to the community.

952
01:39:09,174 --> 01:39:12,818
So no one here, at least I haven't called you a liar.

953
01:39:13,118 --> 01:39:16,441
You openly talk to me any time I make a call.

954
01:39:16,821 --> 01:39:17,521
And I appreciate that.

955
01:39:17,561 --> 01:39:17,982
You both do.

956
01:39:19,612 --> 01:39:22,153
But I told you why I'm invested in this.

957
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:29,297
And I reached out to the connections that I have there to get an understanding what was going on, because I felt that strong about them.

958
01:39:30,317 --> 01:39:36,500
And I hope you could appreciate that from a city councilor and someone that grew up in the city and understands the processes.

959
01:39:37,641 --> 01:39:42,063
So when I heard all the parties and all the issues, I said, jeez, there's definitely a disconnect here.

960
01:39:43,063 --> 01:39:45,004
There's a communication gap somewhere here.

961
01:39:47,025 --> 01:39:48,926
And we asked for that meeting, and I said,

962
01:39:50,470 --> 01:39:51,211
And what did I say?

963
01:39:51,311 --> 01:39:55,076
I said, I need to go public with this, because I think it's important.

964
01:39:56,778 --> 01:40:02,726
Because leaving Armstrong has left a lot of questions for a lot of residents, whether we're doing this or not.

965
01:40:06,477 --> 01:40:07,438
Take it for what it's worth.

966
01:40:07,578 --> 01:40:09,299
I think it's important that we have that meeting.

967
01:40:09,719 --> 01:40:14,843
I think that we understand because, hey, my phone just blew up 15 times.

968
01:40:15,223 --> 01:40:16,464
What 45 minute call?

969
01:40:17,065 --> 01:40:18,686
Armstrong dropped the ball 45 minutes.

970
01:40:18,946 --> 01:40:29,013
Now I can explain what I got for documentation that showed what happened, and I could show you how Armstrong self-reported that within minutes.

971
01:40:30,154 --> 01:40:34,217
I could show what they showed me, but that's going down that rabbit hole that I don't want to.

972
01:40:38,601 --> 01:40:49,092
So that's why I call for that meeting committee to the whole that we could sit and discuss this, look at the options if we have to go in a private session to get to more, to get understanding and then move forward.

973
01:40:49,753 --> 01:40:50,133
That's all.

974
01:40:51,114 --> 01:40:51,915
Thank you, Mr. President.

975
01:40:53,056 --> 01:40:53,396
Thank you.

976
01:40:54,337 --> 01:40:59,583
Um, and chief, just, uh, you know, I appreciate what you said.

977
01:41:01,105 --> 01:41:07,950
right here, right now, because it was the honest, your perspective of the truth, right?

978
01:41:08,030 --> 01:41:11,993
What you said was, this is what I experienced in this negotiation, and it was straight up.

979
01:41:12,053 --> 01:41:14,335
It was, I think we've had issues with Armstrong.

980
01:41:15,115 --> 01:41:16,556
I think we're getting more from Cataldo.

981
01:41:17,477 --> 01:41:21,820
My 30-plus years of experience as a public safety official, I think this is a better deal for the city.

982
01:41:23,001 --> 01:41:26,624
And that's your position on this, and you're sticking to it.

983
01:41:27,643 --> 01:41:32,005
And I think that's very different from, well, we don't want to air the dirty laundry, right?

984
01:41:32,245 --> 01:41:42,631
I think what you said is a clear, concise viewpoint, and you're saying, trust me, I'm the chief of police, I've been doing this a long time, and this is what's happened as I've been the chief of police.

985
01:41:43,171 --> 01:41:51,035
And I just think that that engenders a lot more trust in the public than we think this is the right call, we don't want to talk about the details because we don't want anybody to get hurt.

986
01:41:51,355 --> 01:41:52,756
And that's just where I'm coming from here, right?

987
01:41:55,617 --> 01:42:08,641
Something that's really frustrated me as I've done research over the last couple weeks is that the state does not put out clear data around some of these things, around response times, around some of the incidents.

988
01:42:09,242 --> 01:42:18,645
You know, to me these have been raised as a couple of troubling, but two troubling stories of these long response times.

989
01:42:19,604 --> 01:42:25,967
And I would wanna ask, do these two troubling stories constitute a consistent and persistent pattern, or are they aberrations?

990
01:42:26,548 --> 01:42:28,869
You know, what is the average response time here in Medford?

991
01:42:30,530 --> 01:42:35,292
You know, what does the new contract say about what Cataldo says they'll do as a response time?

992
01:42:35,352 --> 01:42:37,333
Is that higher or lower than what Armstrong said, right?

993
01:42:37,993 --> 01:42:40,895
And it's not about not trusting your, you.

994
01:42:41,635 --> 01:42:43,196
To me, it's just, I wanna see the numbers.

995
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,737
I wanna see the numbers about

996
01:42:46,028 --> 01:42:49,450
that prove your case, that are backing your argument.

997
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:51,211
That's where I'm coming from on this.

998
01:42:52,011 --> 01:43:02,096
So I appreciate that you've been really clear about what you said, you know, your position on it, but I haven't seen the numbers, right?

999
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:03,757
That's the piece of it that's missing for me.

1000
01:43:04,297 --> 01:43:05,657
And this is a really important,

1001
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:08,070
It's a really important thing.

1002
01:43:08,530 --> 01:43:09,111
You acknowledge it.

1003
01:43:09,131 --> 01:43:10,051
Everyone here acknowledges it.

1004
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:14,292
The last thing we want to do is make people worried that they're less safe.

1005
01:43:14,972 --> 01:43:17,033
And you did the analysis.

1006
01:43:17,053 --> 01:43:19,054
The Chief of Staff mentioned that there was an analysis.

1007
01:43:19,294 --> 01:43:24,175
And I just want to talk about that analysis openly and honestly and let it land where it may.

1008
01:43:24,735 --> 01:43:27,576
You know, Armstrong has said, we want it all out on the table.

1009
01:43:27,796 --> 01:43:30,417
And I just think, and you said, let's just be honest, let's be clear.

1010
01:43:30,937 --> 01:43:32,978
And I think residents just want to hear the honest truth.

1011
01:43:33,838 --> 01:43:41,984
And I just personally, the thing that's been frustrating for me throughout this conversation on my end has been, you know, well, we just don't want to, we don't want to put the stuff out there.

1012
01:43:42,024 --> 01:43:43,125
We don't want anybody to get hurt.

1013
01:43:43,265 --> 01:43:44,967
It's like, well, yeah, nobody wants anybody to get hurt.

1014
01:43:45,067 --> 01:43:47,328
Nobody wants EMS to be an issue.

1015
01:43:48,169 --> 01:43:49,830
Let's just put all the information out there.

1016
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:56,695
If you guys believe you, you guys are the chiefs of fire and police, the mayor negotiates the contracts,

1017
01:43:58,256 --> 01:44:01,378
But a lot of people have contacted us and said, why is this happening?

1018
01:44:01,658 --> 01:44:02,818
And we just want those answers.

1019
01:44:02,918 --> 01:44:07,280
So I hope that we can kind of have the conversation on those terms as we move ahead.

1020
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:08,021
Thank you.

1021
01:44:08,041 --> 01:44:09,962
I appreciate you saying that.

1022
01:44:09,982 --> 01:44:10,742
I just have one point.

1023
01:44:10,842 --> 01:44:13,483
It's not just the numbers that you're looking for.

1024
01:44:13,643 --> 01:44:17,325
I mean, remember, this started with, you know,

1025
01:44:18,365 --> 01:44:29,250
a statement from Armstrong Ambulance that they were not going to honor the current contract that they were working under and that they were going to change certain practices or policies that they had under.

1026
01:44:29,490 --> 01:44:31,691
So that is the beginning of it all.

1027
01:44:32,932 --> 01:44:34,853
And then we have issues with performance.

1028
01:44:35,833 --> 01:44:44,237
So it's not just counting the numbers and saying, hey, we have an issue with, I don't know why they made the business decision they made, but they did.

1029
01:44:45,786 --> 01:44:48,427
which forces us as leaders to make decisions on our end.

1030
01:44:49,028 --> 01:44:49,208
Great.

1031
01:44:49,808 --> 01:44:50,969
And I mean, I appreciate, like.

1032
01:44:51,409 --> 01:44:53,450
I'm just saying it's not just numbers.

1033
01:44:53,550 --> 01:44:54,811
There's other aspects of it.

1034
01:44:55,031 --> 01:45:02,295
And I think putting that all out on the table too, right, maybe that's some of the things we don't want to talk about because people might get hurt thing.

1035
01:45:02,655 --> 01:45:03,215
Let's just say it.

1036
01:45:03,416 --> 01:45:04,696
Let's just say what's happening.

1037
01:45:04,956 --> 01:45:05,857
That's all I'm saying here.

1038
01:45:06,929 --> 01:45:07,990
We don't have to say it right now.

1039
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:12,312
I would like to have another meeting about this because we have a lot of other things to do tonight and we have a lot of people who want to speak.

1040
01:45:12,532 --> 01:45:18,315
But you know to me it's I just think let's say what's happened.

1041
01:45:18,655 --> 01:45:19,315
How we got here.

1042
01:45:19,635 --> 01:45:20,215
How did this start.

1043
01:45:20,255 --> 01:45:20,896
What was the issue.

1044
01:45:22,377 --> 01:45:24,117
And and we'll just have that out there.

1045
01:45:24,818 --> 01:45:25,698
That's the piece that I didn't.

1046
01:45:26,178 --> 01:45:29,020
I've had frustration with was that let's not talk about it because people might get hurt.

1047
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:30,060
Understood President.

1048
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:30,480
Thank you.

1049
01:45:33,082 --> 01:45:33,622
Councilor Scarpelli.

1050
01:45:38,647 --> 01:45:39,408
We have people that speak.

1051
01:45:39,868 --> 01:45:40,849
I'm fine, Mr. President, right now.

1052
01:45:40,869 --> 01:45:41,369
All right.

1053
01:45:41,609 --> 01:45:43,410
We'll continue with public participation.

1054
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:45,031
We're going to go back to public participation.

1055
01:45:46,392 --> 01:45:47,833
We'll stay at the podium.

1056
01:45:47,873 --> 01:45:49,433
I'm not seeing any hands raised on Zoom.

1057
01:45:50,494 --> 01:45:53,135
If you could give us your name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

1058
01:45:54,036 --> 01:45:54,596
Good evening, Council.

1059
01:45:54,976 --> 01:45:55,697
My name is Dan Miller.

1060
01:45:56,157 --> 01:45:57,598
My address is 5 Summers Ave.

1061
01:45:58,058 --> 01:45:59,379
in Allentown, New Hampshire.

1062
01:45:59,839 --> 01:46:00,900
I'm not a resident of Medford.

1063
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:04,562
I have never lived in Medford, but I have worked in Medford for the last 10 years.

1064
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:09,242
Tomorrow morning at 4 a.m., I'm gonna wake up.

1065
01:46:09,262 --> 01:46:16,467
We're gonna have an hour and a half to get on the ambulance in Medford for my 24-hour shift, just like I have for the last six years for 48 hours a week.

1066
01:46:17,528 --> 01:46:23,492
All my coworkers over here, if you guys wouldn't mind, can you guys, anyone raise a hand if you had a training shift with me in Medford?

1067
01:46:28,135 --> 01:46:30,137
We love working in Medford.

1068
01:46:30,357 --> 01:46:34,580
Armstrong and Medford have a great relationship from the boots on the ground up.

1069
01:46:36,222 --> 01:46:42,804
It's incredibly concerning to us, the people that love working here, the way that this contract negotiation is hanging.

1070
01:46:42,864 --> 01:46:44,124
We only have an outsider.

1071
01:46:44,164 --> 01:46:49,905
I cannot speak to the negotiations, what Cataldo has promised, what Armstrong has promised, anything that went on in that room.

1072
01:46:50,445 --> 01:46:59,427
But, President Vares, your question of how does bringing a new provider into the city make you safer?

1073
01:47:00,167 --> 01:47:03,008
The real answer that no one is talking about is it doesn't.

1074
01:47:05,585 --> 01:47:12,947
Me and a lot of my co-workers, we're not gonna move to Cataldo in order to continue working in Bedford.

1075
01:47:12,987 --> 01:47:22,028
As much as we love this place, as much as we are passionate about serving this city, because of the company culture over there, because of a lot of different factors, because of all sorts of things.

1076
01:47:22,889 --> 01:47:28,810
It's kind of known that the cities at Cataldo services experience

1077
01:47:30,296 --> 01:47:30,997
longer response times.

1078
01:47:31,017 --> 01:47:34,559
There's been a lot made of response times tonight, and I'm sure there's a lot of numbers out there.

1079
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,702
But I can only share my own personal experience.

1080
01:47:38,402 --> 01:47:56,716
In the summer of 2023, I was a supervisor for Armstrong's responding into the city of Everett, a city we do not service, with another one of our ambulances from Saugus, where firefighters had been on scene working a cardiac arrest in the first responders level, which is not the full scope of practice for a cardiac arrest, for 25 minutes.

1081
01:47:58,083 --> 01:48:00,886
on a young man who unfortunately did not make it.

1082
01:48:02,387 --> 01:48:15,298
And I cannot say whether it was a contributing factor, but just like Rich said, every minute of a cardiac arrest, that you are not getting high quality CPR in the way you're supposed to, decreases your survival chance by about 10%.

1083
01:48:17,675 --> 01:48:25,620
I hear stories time and time and time again of people who have had bad experience with Consolidate because of long response times, because they are stretched thin, they are short-staffed.

1084
01:48:26,901 --> 01:48:28,221
Private EMS is a very small world.

1085
01:48:28,402 --> 01:48:39,428
We've heard from a lot of our co-workers that are at Consolidate that people are not giving up their shifts to come to Medford, that Consolidate is counting on an influx of employees from Armstrong to staff those ambulances that they promised you in that contract.

1086
01:48:40,309 --> 01:48:40,949
That's not happening.

1087
01:48:44,027 --> 01:48:45,570
Like I said, I love working here.

1088
01:48:45,850 --> 01:48:48,295
I know the people of the city incredibly well.

1089
01:48:48,315 --> 01:48:49,677
I've worked here for a long, long time.

1090
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:54,787
Knowing your patient population, knowing the patient, the city that you're serving.

1091
01:48:55,778 --> 01:48:56,278
is important.

1092
01:48:56,298 --> 01:48:57,579
That does not happen overnight.

1093
01:48:57,619 --> 01:48:59,339
That does not happen with a contract transfer.

1094
01:48:59,359 --> 01:49:05,502
That happens with people being in the city for a long period of time and caring for a long period of time.

1095
01:49:05,622 --> 01:49:08,923
And I certainly hope that I think sunlight is the best disinfectant.

1096
01:49:09,583 --> 01:49:12,064
If there are issues with Armstrong, I think they should be aired.

1097
01:49:12,084 --> 01:49:13,424
I think the chief should talk about it.

1098
01:49:13,444 --> 01:49:18,586
I think the chief of staff should be open and honest about it because I think the people of Medford deserve to know what those issues are.

1099
01:49:18,626 --> 01:49:19,907
I'm not saying that Armstrong is perfect.

1100
01:49:21,926 --> 01:49:25,008
I understand the situation that they're talking about with the longer response times.

1101
01:49:25,269 --> 01:49:30,832
But I also understand that Armstrong is willing to work with Medford in order to fix those issues.

1102
01:49:31,332 --> 01:49:35,014
And I don't think those issues are better served with it, although I think they're actually exacerbated.

1103
01:49:35,955 --> 01:49:42,479
So I don't know what the process is from here, but I certainly hope that there is some way that that can be examined.

1104
01:49:42,879 --> 01:49:43,139
Thanks.

1105
01:49:43,560 --> 01:49:46,101
And I appreciate your service to the Senate.

1106
01:49:46,161 --> 01:49:46,542
Thank you.

1107
01:49:46,562 --> 01:49:47,182
I appreciate it.

1108
01:49:50,673 --> 01:49:55,094
Guys, going forward from here, I'm just going to chime in at about three minutes and give you a chance to wrap up.

1109
01:49:55,454 --> 01:49:56,495
I just want to let everybody know.

1110
01:49:56,695 --> 01:49:57,395
Thank you.

1111
01:49:58,215 --> 01:49:58,575
Floor is yours.

1112
01:49:58,595 --> 01:50:01,056
If you could give us your name and address for the record, and you'll have three minutes.

1113
01:50:01,416 --> 01:50:01,696
Thank you.

1114
01:50:02,356 --> 01:50:03,436
My name is James Friederborn.

1115
01:50:03,676 --> 01:50:05,437
I live at 60 Elm Street in Medford.

1116
01:50:05,457 --> 01:50:07,677
I'm a Medford resident and a constituent of yours.

1117
01:50:08,257 --> 01:50:09,198
I'm also a paramedic.

1118
01:50:09,578 --> 01:50:12,678
I've worked as an EMT and paramedic in the Commonwealth for 12 years.

1119
01:50:13,099 --> 01:50:14,399
I do not work for Armstrong.

1120
01:50:14,419 --> 01:50:19,220
I've never worked for Armstrong, but I've worked for a various number of cities throughout the state and the country.

1121
01:50:20,061 --> 01:50:25,628
I've heard a lot of people here today say, you know, Talbot this, Armstrong that.

1122
01:50:25,908 --> 01:50:28,231
At the end of the day, they're both private companies.

1123
01:50:28,591 --> 01:50:29,592
They both work for pay.

1124
01:50:29,893 --> 01:50:31,194
They're both going to have their issues.

1125
01:50:31,935 --> 01:50:36,921
But what upsets me so much is that this is a company that has been here for 25 years.

1126
01:50:38,503 --> 01:50:42,708
Some of their medics and EMTs have served this community for so long.

1127
01:50:43,109 --> 01:50:53,321
And to see a decision made without public transparency, you know, I keep hearing, you know, 45 minute, you know, 45 minute this, you know, poor performance this, poor performance that.

1128
01:50:55,074 --> 01:50:56,755
I would like to see some transparency.

1129
01:50:57,415 --> 01:50:59,436
Clearly, the public is upset.

1130
01:51:00,156 --> 01:51:02,937
And I hear your frustrations, Chief, both of you.

1131
01:51:02,977 --> 01:51:05,398
I mean, you're both very well-respected, obviously.

1132
01:51:05,438 --> 01:51:10,020
I don't think that you don't know how to do your jobs.

1133
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:14,562
But at the end of the day, it's about public transparency.

1134
01:51:15,062 --> 01:51:17,723
Clearly, there are people in Medford who are upset about this.

1135
01:51:18,636 --> 01:51:22,419
There needs to be more transparency on why this change occurred.

1136
01:51:23,060 --> 01:51:30,246
And honestly, at the end of the day, I think it's about standing up for our EMTs and paramedics who have served this community for 25 years.

1137
01:51:30,947 --> 01:51:35,131
I mean, I've heard, you know, we heard the chief of staff come up here and say, I could never do that job.

1138
01:51:35,511 --> 01:51:43,338
Do you know how many times I hear a day, I couldn't be a paramedic, I couldn't be an EMT, and you guys don't make enough money, you don't know, you know, you guys don't, you guys don't get respected?

1139
01:51:43,758 --> 01:51:49,223
Except here we are throwing out an ambulance service after 25 years of service.

1140
01:51:49,623 --> 01:51:51,084
We wouldn't throw the fire department out.

1141
01:51:51,525 --> 01:51:55,869
We wouldn't say, oh, we're going to go get mauled in fire because they made a mistake or a long response time.

1142
01:51:56,309 --> 01:52:02,714
We would work with them to improve the systems that we have because they're dedicated to our citizens.

1143
01:52:03,516 --> 01:52:11,442
And it just, it rips my heart out to see our EMTs and paramedics treated like this.

1144
01:52:11,502 --> 01:52:13,064
They're put in the middle of this.

1145
01:52:13,864 --> 01:52:15,566
They all clearly are here.

1146
01:52:15,626 --> 01:52:21,370
They're all wanna serve Medford, and they're being put in the middle of politics.

1147
01:52:21,891 --> 01:52:30,678
They're being put in the middle of you guys and the mayor and the chief, and there's just no transparency whatsoever about what's going on.

1148
01:52:31,578 --> 01:52:50,973
I'm more confused coming to this meeting than I was before about why, why, not why the contract changed, but just why in general, why these decisions were made, why questions that are being asked aren't answered, why we're hearing all of these facts, but nobody's backing them up with data.

1149
01:52:50,993 --> 01:52:59,120
We haven't, you know, nobody is presenting anything that is, you know, factual, hard-based data that says, you know, yep, we could tell those, you know,

1150
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:02,602
Response time is this, and Armstrong's response time is this.

1151
01:53:02,942 --> 01:53:11,347
And to me, that tells me that either A, you're not telling us because there's something else, or because there's an issue.

1152
01:53:12,327 --> 01:53:12,548
Thank you.

1153
01:53:12,928 --> 01:53:13,288
Thank you.

1154
01:53:20,012 --> 01:53:20,572
All right.

1155
01:53:20,592 --> 01:53:22,373
Still no hands on Zoom, so we'll stay at the podium.

1156
01:53:22,473 --> 01:53:23,534
Name and address for the record, please.

1157
01:53:23,554 --> 01:53:24,134
You have three minutes.

1158
01:53:24,755 --> 01:53:25,035
OK.

1159
01:53:25,255 --> 01:53:28,117
Simon Elsindor, 44 Tainter Street, and?

1160
01:53:29,316 --> 01:53:48,245
The reason why I came up here is because my issue with this is not necessarily the overall fact that we're changing providers, but I think the issue that many people have pointed out is that there is a history of sketchy behavior when it comes to things like this from the mayor, of not only announcing things rather late and

1161
01:53:49,245 --> 01:54:03,731
in a way that catches everyone off guard, go back to the trashing, whatever, but also in a way that fundamentally changes the ways that we do things in Medford to a way that people clearly do not, that people clearly have issues with and want answers about.

1162
01:54:04,152 --> 01:54:11,735
There is no reason why we cannot get answers as to at least what the process was, even if we can't necessarily get things to change back.

1163
01:54:13,937 --> 01:54:17,959
What the public is requesting is just to know what this is about.

1164
01:54:18,599 --> 01:54:27,103
And it's very clear that there is some sort of story here that both sides are not currently going to tell for obvious reasons at this meeting.

1165
01:54:27,423 --> 01:54:29,024
But that is what this resolution is for.

1166
01:54:29,084 --> 01:54:32,846
This resolution is not saying we're changing this back or anything like that.

1167
01:54:33,126 --> 01:54:41,670
The resolution is stating that we are going to have hearing about this, we are going to have a review about what actually led to us getting into this situation in the first place.

1168
01:54:42,410 --> 01:54:49,014
I simply just do not see the reason why the city needs to be so defensive when it is clear that they did have a process.

1169
01:54:49,334 --> 01:54:57,819
If that process was indeed correct, then that should be something that we are able to talk about and actually have a normal conversation about at a separate meeting.

1170
01:54:58,979 --> 01:55:00,640
That is what puts me off about this most.

1171
01:55:00,660 --> 01:55:08,805
It's the fact that we as city officials getting disoffensive over the fact that, over the mere suggestion that there might have been something wrong.

1172
01:55:09,675 --> 01:55:27,278
That is personally just what concerns me the most, because personally, I wouldn't have thought anything of that before, but seeing how, seeing the responses of our city officials has only made me think that there may be something amiss.

1173
01:55:27,999 --> 01:55:30,859
There probably isn't, but I would like to know one way or the other.

1174
01:55:30,879 --> 01:55:33,960
Yeah, thank you.

1175
01:55:39,913 --> 01:55:41,414
Still no hands on Zoom, we'll stay at the podium.

1176
01:55:41,634 --> 01:55:42,615
Name and address for the record.

1177
01:55:42,635 --> 01:55:47,139
You have three minutes and have your guest on.

1178
01:55:47,179 --> 01:55:49,020
I just want to make a general comment.

1179
01:55:49,661 --> 01:55:56,466
I think it's rather obvious that we have a problem with procurement contracts in this city.

1180
01:55:56,707 --> 01:55:58,388
I mean, this is a manifestation of it.

1181
01:55:58,908 --> 01:56:02,011
There's also manifestation on the municipal solid waste.

1182
01:56:02,251 --> 01:56:04,213
There's a lot of talking about what has happened.

1183
01:56:05,714 --> 01:56:10,878
I didn't know, for example, that this particular contract was exempt from Chapter 30B.

1184
01:56:11,598 --> 01:56:15,301
My understanding is that legal services are also exempt from Chapter 30B.

1185
01:56:17,302 --> 01:56:19,704
I believe now we lost our city solicitor again.

1186
01:56:21,426 --> 01:56:35,216
But even for municipal solid waste, which should be done according or was done according to Chapter 30B, I think we need to sort of revisit how procurement contracts are done.

1187
01:56:35,536 --> 01:56:38,979
And this is a body whose task is to legislate.

1188
01:56:39,719 --> 01:57:03,395
We it seems that we need to legislate in particular those things that are not subject to chapter 30 B So the city follows a competitive transparent open to the public bidding process Where we're not following sort of a reactive approach that you know, there's something happens to contract everyone finds out after the fact huge turmoil

1189
01:57:04,255 --> 01:57:07,617
And then we waste a bunch of time trying to fix it.

1190
01:57:08,758 --> 01:57:10,159
But rather we are proactive, right?

1191
01:57:10,179 --> 01:57:21,507
So the public, everyone, all the stakeholders, everyone that's involved is sort of like participants in the process before we actually make a decision.

1192
01:57:22,028 --> 01:57:26,531
So I just wanted to say that I think it's time to basically legislate this.

1193
01:57:26,671 --> 01:57:28,913
Again, in particular things that are exempt from Chapter 30B.

1194
01:57:29,713 --> 01:57:31,994
I think the city council should, you know, write something.

1195
01:57:32,594 --> 01:57:55,705
And so the mayor actually has to follow a competitive, transparent, open to the public bidding process where all the stakeholders, taxpayers, et cetera, we can be sort of part of the process as it happens in a proactive fashion rather than reactive after the fact when it's also very possibly limited what we can actually do.

1196
01:57:56,025 --> 01:57:56,505
Thank you so much.

1197
01:57:57,446 --> 01:57:57,706
Thank you.

1198
01:58:02,872 --> 01:58:12,075
Still no hands on Zoom, so we will let NBC 10 take their microphone, and then we will stay at the podium.

1199
01:58:12,715 --> 01:58:13,236
Sorry, Nick.

1200
01:58:13,736 --> 01:58:15,056
I'll live with it.

1201
01:58:15,516 --> 01:58:16,497
Name and address for the record.

1202
01:58:16,517 --> 01:58:17,197
You have three minutes.

1203
01:58:17,750 --> 01:58:19,131
Nick Giurleo, 40 Robinson Road.

1204
01:58:20,272 --> 01:58:27,938
I wasn't actually planning on speaking about this, believe it or not, but there was something that the mayor's chief of staff said that really stood out to me, really struck me.

1205
01:58:28,398 --> 01:58:34,623
She mentioned that carrying on this conversation would create, quote, concern and fear, unquote.

1206
01:58:35,384 --> 01:58:36,545
Carrying on the conversation.

1207
01:58:37,305 --> 01:58:41,529
In other words, simply talking about this will make residents worried.

1208
01:58:41,629 --> 01:58:43,950
Simply talking about this isn't in the public interest.

1209
01:58:44,071 --> 01:58:45,532
To me, that's just really, really,

1210
01:58:46,370 --> 01:58:49,011
shameful, a really kind of terrible thing to say.

1211
01:58:49,951 --> 01:58:57,133
This, what our city government does, you know, behind the scenes, behind closed doors, is something the public should know about.

1212
01:58:57,453 --> 01:59:01,334
We should know what's going on with these negotiations, with any negotiations.

1213
01:59:02,174 --> 01:59:10,557
I have tried to look for contracts that our city has entered into on the city website, and you would think, you know, you could just go onto the city website and it'd be an easy PDF download.

1214
01:59:10,577 --> 01:59:11,257
They're just not there.

1215
01:59:12,047 --> 01:59:17,732
And sometimes you reach out to department heads, you ask for contracts, and some of them are very cooperative and will give you the contract.

1216
01:59:17,832 --> 01:59:23,217
Others will dig their heels in, and you try to make a public records request, and there's heel digging in with that.

1217
01:59:23,937 --> 01:59:30,423
So many citizens, and just speaking on behalf of one who's not behind the podium here, just don't know what's going on in Medford.

1218
01:59:30,743 --> 01:59:32,305
You know, they just don't understand what our

1219
01:59:33,292 --> 01:59:34,273
city leadership is doing.

1220
01:59:34,293 --> 01:59:41,983
And, yes, to some extent, we vote for our leaders, we entrust them to make decisions for us to exercise leadership.

1221
01:59:42,003 --> 01:59:44,346
This is what the chief of police alluded to.

1222
01:59:44,726 --> 01:59:46,368
Yes, I understand and respect that.

1223
01:59:47,150 --> 01:59:53,954
But at the same time, the public does have a right to know what their elected leaders are doing so they can hold them accountable for the decisions they made.

1224
01:59:53,974 --> 01:59:59,538
If we don't know what our leaders are doing, we can't hold them accountable and make intelligent decisions come next election.

1225
01:59:59,958 --> 02:00:03,501
So this is very much in the public interest, and we really do need to flesh it out.

1226
02:00:03,601 --> 02:00:05,362
So I'm in full support of this resolution.

1227
02:00:05,442 --> 02:00:07,924
I think we need to keep this conversation going.

1228
02:00:08,304 --> 02:00:10,325
Armstrong has been with us for 25 years.

1229
02:00:10,826 --> 02:00:11,546
It's a long time.

1230
02:00:13,374 --> 02:00:15,775
By most accounts, they've been doing a good job at what they've been doing.

1231
02:00:15,956 --> 02:00:17,817
I know there's some dispute to the facts of that.

1232
02:00:18,377 --> 02:00:23,820
Let's investigate that, and let's get some more information on why there's belief in the administration that they're not doing a good job.

1233
02:00:24,461 --> 02:00:30,304
But I've only heard good things, and I don't understand why the mayor made this decision, and I'd like some answers.

1234
02:00:30,424 --> 02:00:31,665
And I think so many other people would.

1235
02:00:32,045 --> 02:00:35,187
And I hope our leaders will get those answers for the public.

1236
02:00:35,487 --> 02:00:35,787
Thank you.

1237
02:00:36,628 --> 02:00:36,888
Thank you.

1238
02:00:42,666 --> 02:00:43,426
We'll stay at the podium.

1239
02:00:43,666 --> 02:00:44,706
Name and address for the record, please.

1240
02:00:44,726 --> 02:00:45,427
You'll have three minutes.

1241
02:00:45,527 --> 02:00:45,887
Good evening.

1242
02:00:46,427 --> 02:00:47,387
My name is Joe Musi.

1243
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:49,187
I live on Bowen Ave in Medford.

1244
02:00:50,188 --> 02:00:51,088
I'm a Medford resident.

1245
02:00:51,568 --> 02:00:54,549
I work full time in consulting.

1246
02:00:55,069 --> 02:00:59,730
I own and manage several properties in the city of Medford, and I work 16 hours a week, roughly, for Armstrong.

1247
02:01:01,210 --> 02:01:04,451
So thank you for having us all, and I appreciate everyone that spoke before me.

1248
02:01:05,095 --> 02:01:09,757
So I made a decision to work for Armstrong how maybe several of my colleagues have.

1249
02:01:10,057 --> 02:01:19,702
I did a ride along with two companies and I chose Armstrong over the second company that I did a ride along with and they do serve neighboring communities.

1250
02:01:20,242 --> 02:01:29,726
So I found out about the news during Christmas break and I was interested to learn more as a resident of the city.

1251
02:01:30,027 --> 02:01:33,148
I'll speak from that lens not so much as an employee of Armstrong.

1252
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:54,255
I work out of the Woburn base, so I'm not impacted by the decision necessarily, but I'm more concerned from the city standpoint, switching providers with this tight timeline of January 19th, how Cataldo plans to staff a base, provide 24-7 care to a city of Medford size.

1253
02:01:55,353 --> 02:02:01,975
I emailed the mayor several points requesting that information, and I did not receive a response, which was concerning.

1254
02:02:02,775 --> 02:02:13,637
And then I sent my resume to Cataldo, and two days before Christmas, they called me, and they are actively hiring full and part-time EMTs for the city.

1255
02:02:14,378 --> 02:02:20,199
Their first orientation class does not occur until the end of January, which is well after the deadline of the transition.

1256
02:02:20,879 --> 02:02:24,400
And the long-time employee has been there for over 20 years, said they have no plan.

1257
02:02:25,502 --> 02:02:28,965
for bases and they don't really know what they're doing yet for the rollout.

1258
02:02:29,485 --> 02:02:38,052
So naturally that is really alarming and I think everyone deserves to know that that is what was communicated from the staff to me at that point.

1259
02:02:39,253 --> 02:02:42,255
But again I just would like the city to have a plan.

1260
02:02:42,953 --> 02:02:44,054
and direct oversight.

1261
02:02:44,074 --> 02:02:51,340
I think there were some comments made earlier by some of our chiefs that said that we have to take their word, but we all know a private company can't govern itself.

1262
02:02:51,641 --> 02:02:59,668
There has to be oversight, and they have to be managed and held accountable, and simply just saying, oh, they told us this, we will trust them, is not going to work.

1263
02:03:00,088 --> 02:03:02,370
So I would like to see a plan of that transition.

1264
02:03:02,710 --> 02:03:10,036
It should be laid out very clearly, and it should state exactly what's being provided, how it's going to be staffed, and I think we need

1265
02:03:10,857 --> 02:03:15,861
something written down and shown to us where we can see and approve it, perhaps the timeline needs to be pushed slightly.

1266
02:03:16,221 --> 02:03:17,062
I think that's very reasonable.

1267
02:03:17,082 --> 02:03:17,882
There's no shame in that.

1268
02:03:18,343 --> 02:03:24,847
But I am concerned based on what I heard from Cataldo and what I didn't hear from the mayor is concerning.

1269
02:03:24,988 --> 02:03:25,288
Thank you.

1270
02:03:26,589 --> 02:03:26,909
Thank you.

1271
02:03:33,254 --> 02:03:33,534
Thank you.

1272
02:03:33,554 --> 02:03:34,254
Name and address for the record.

1273
02:03:34,274 --> 02:03:34,835
You have three minutes.

1274
02:03:35,263 --> 02:03:36,684
You know, my name is Michael Asario.

1275
02:03:37,184 --> 02:03:43,607
I live in Jero, Mass., but I work as an EMT in many of the communities around here, Lawrence, everywhere, right?

1276
02:03:44,367 --> 02:03:46,488
So you say there's no statistics on EMS.

1277
02:03:47,509 --> 02:03:55,413
Fox 25 News had a whole video, a ride-along with CEO Michael Wonka of Action Ambulance.

1278
02:03:56,371 --> 02:03:57,291
that showed you the facts.

1279
02:03:57,852 --> 02:04:00,813
Throughout the whole state, there's a major problem with EMS.

1280
02:04:01,554 --> 02:04:02,854
There's a lot of calls.

1281
02:04:03,194 --> 02:04:12,919
There's a lot more mental health issues and a lot more medical issues that allow staff to, you know, it's like a cracker jack box.

1282
02:04:13,079 --> 02:04:14,940
You don't know what you're going to get at any given time.

1283
02:04:15,761 --> 02:04:20,243
So I think everyone needs to get their big boy shoes on and girl shoes on and figure it out.

1284
02:04:21,284 --> 02:04:23,184
Because they've worked very hard for 25 years

1285
02:04:24,839 --> 02:04:27,320
You're not going to get any better, especially from Catawba, OK?

1286
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:29,640
Catawba is stretched out.

1287
02:04:31,361 --> 02:04:37,442
So I think that you just need to look at that video, go on Google, and it will show you.

1288
02:04:39,663 --> 02:04:40,103
We're short.

1289
02:04:40,463 --> 02:04:46,105
It's very, at any given time, you just don't know what you're going to get.

1290
02:04:46,125 --> 02:04:48,105
We've been up to like 11 ambulances one time.

1291
02:04:49,026 --> 02:04:53,467
So to say someone's going to do it better, well,

1292
02:04:55,780 --> 02:05:02,525
I mean, it's all in what you have for staff and the dedication.

1293
02:05:02,605 --> 02:05:07,389
I believe that Armstrong for 25 years, if they've been doing it, they got a good dedication.

1294
02:05:08,149 --> 02:05:09,370
So I think you should consider that.

1295
02:05:10,491 --> 02:05:10,831
Thank you.

1296
02:05:11,132 --> 02:05:11,712
Thank you very much.

1297
02:05:18,837 --> 02:05:19,097
All right.

1298
02:05:20,742 --> 02:05:22,443
Not seeing hands on Zoom.

1299
02:05:22,543 --> 02:05:24,565
I think that concludes public comment for the night.

1300
02:05:25,506 --> 02:05:33,652
We have a motion to refer this paper to committee the whole meeting next Tuesday and I will recognize Councilor Sang.

1301
02:05:34,973 --> 02:05:42,039
I just want to thank all our residents and our workers for coming up to speak tonight for

1302
02:05:44,445 --> 02:05:50,388
telling your stories, your experience, your professionalism, your expertise about the issue.

1303
02:05:50,408 --> 02:05:56,490
We on the council can't claim to know the issues in and out as you guys do.

1304
02:05:56,650 --> 02:06:02,753
So it's really important for us to hear from you all so we have the right questions to ask going into Tuesday's meetings.

1305
02:06:05,674 --> 02:06:09,196
I have two overarching thoughts.

1306
02:06:09,576 --> 02:06:10,016
One is that

1307
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:20,504
I have so much trust and I hold in such high esteem our chiefs and our city workers.

1308
02:06:20,784 --> 02:06:28,728
But as those of us who are elected know too, that trust comes with transparency and it comes with accountability as well.

1309
02:06:29,048 --> 02:06:36,391
It comes with being able to answer questions in public as difficult as that may be.

1310
02:06:38,112 --> 02:06:40,113
And I think that's really important.

1311
02:06:40,979 --> 02:07:03,945
I think the second note that I have is, we've heard hints about fiduciary duty and money, and maybe that will come out more in Tuesday's meeting, but I do think that, and I've said this in meetings, especially in the last few months, but I've said this for a very long time, there are a few basic things that any city government has to get right.

1312
02:07:04,846 --> 02:07:09,007
Public safety is chief among them, and while I have trust,

1313
02:07:09,567 --> 02:07:13,735
you know, that Medford is a safe place, that it will keep being a safe place.

1314
02:07:15,037 --> 02:07:20,628
I also want to make sure that we are not balancing that on a dime, that we are

1315
02:07:21,827 --> 02:07:28,229
you know, we're not risking anything just because it saves us a few dollars.

1316
02:07:29,650 --> 02:07:34,632
So I'll leave it at that and leave it to the vote.

1317
02:07:35,852 --> 02:07:36,272
Thank you.

1318
02:07:36,292 --> 02:07:42,675
I actually did, was reminded that we did receive one email and they requested

1319
02:07:43,343 --> 02:07:48,248
They wanted to be here in person and requested that we read it into the record, so I will read it now.

1320
02:07:49,809 --> 02:07:59,919
Dear Counselor, I'm writing as a resident of Medford to express, for what it's worth, my displeasure in the bidding process that resulted in the selection of Cataldo Ambulance as the provider for Medford's 911 Emergency Medical Services, EMS.

1321
02:08:01,413 --> 02:08:11,940
While I understand that state procurement law factors in the selection of provider, the fact remains that Armstrong Ambulance has dutifully served this community for over 25 years, providing excellent care and regularly meeting and exceeding national response time metrics.

1322
02:08:12,620 --> 02:08:16,683
I myself am a paramedic and firefighter who began my career with Armstrong Ambulance 10 years ago.

1323
02:08:17,243 --> 02:08:20,265
I served as both an EMT and paramedic in Medford for five of those years.

1324
02:08:20,725 --> 02:08:26,329
And after working in this great city, I decided to make it my home, first by renting an apartment and subsequently purchasing my first home.

1325
02:08:27,015 --> 02:08:32,560
I know many former co-workers from Armstrong feel similarly about this community and have decided to make it their own as I have.

1326
02:08:33,401 --> 02:08:35,903
In that time, I've worked as a first responder.

1327
02:08:36,383 --> 02:08:38,545
I have worked for both Armstrong and Cataldo.

1328
02:08:39,006 --> 02:08:44,511
In the short time I worked for Cataldo, my impression of their service was one that did not prioritize meeting response requirements.

1329
02:08:44,811 --> 02:08:52,458
In contrast, Armstrong has always firmly held to the requirements to backfill utilized trucks in Medford, limiting the time the city goes without a unit significantly.

1330
02:08:53,063 --> 02:08:59,569
Indeed, the fact that Armstrong Ambulance is the largest and, to my knowledge, only union ambulance service in the State of Massachusetts helps to guarantee this.

1331
02:09:00,170 --> 02:09:06,356
Contractually mandated minimum staffing levels guarantee that ambulances will be available when they are needed in a timely and efficient manner.

1332
02:09:06,936 --> 02:09:15,144
In contrast, with no such provisions from Cataldo, it is not only feasible but likely that the closest available ambulance may be coming from many towns away, wasting crucial time.

1333
02:09:15,767 --> 02:09:23,634
While I unfortunately will not be able to attend tonight's city council meeting due to a prior engagement, I wish to voice my displeasure in the strongest terms of the handling of this contract.

1334
02:09:24,074 --> 02:09:37,005
I understand that procurement law plays a large part in the handling of municipal contracts, but the utter lack of transparency from a mayor who already has a clear record of retaliation, both against unions and first responders, is enough to cement the appearance of foul play in negotiations.

1335
02:09:37,525 --> 02:09:43,210
From the perspective of a citizen, it appears that the mayor is playing games with essential services which save the lives of the people of Medford.

1336
02:09:43,750 --> 02:09:54,137
In summation, whereas before January 19th, I never had the concern that an ambulance would be available to save the life of my loved ones and neighbors when, God forbid, they needed it most, I will no longer have that certainty moving forward.

1337
02:09:54,537 --> 02:10:00,161
I hope that I am wrong, but I fear that the end result will be an entirely preventable loss of lives that will rest squarely on the shoulders of the mayor.

1338
02:10:00,281 --> 02:10:02,542
Sincerely, James Mello, Wauson Street.

1339
02:10:05,464 --> 02:10:08,206
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli.

1340
02:10:09,928 --> 02:10:25,414
to refer to a committee of the whole next Tuesday where we will invite all of the parties, the mayor's team, our police and fire chiefs, our 9-1-1 dispatch head, Armstrong Ambulance and Cataldo are all welcome to attend, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1341
02:10:26,675 --> 02:10:27,335
All those in favor?

1342
02:10:28,176 --> 02:10:28,536
Opposed?

1343
02:10:28,556 --> 02:10:29,216
The motion passes.

1344
02:10:33,257 --> 02:10:33,537
All right.

1345
02:10:35,238 --> 02:10:37,980
Regular order business, petitions, presentations and similar papers.

1346
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:42,944
26006, petition for a common victor's license, Wunder HDR Holdings.

1347
02:10:42,984 --> 02:10:53,531
This is to certify that a common victor's license is hereby granted to Wunder HDR Holdings, LLC, Massachusetts, DBA Wunder, location 55 Station Landing, Medford, Massachusetts.

1348
02:10:54,271 --> 02:10:56,793
Hours of operation, Monday through Sunday, 10 a.m.

1349
02:10:57,233 --> 02:10:57,694
to 11 p.m.

1350
02:10:57,774 --> 02:11:00,516
Well, it looks like Wednesday is 10.30 a.m.

1351
02:11:00,556 --> 02:11:00,756
to 11 p.m.

1352
02:11:02,517 --> 02:11:06,390
Do we have a representative either in person or on Zoom from Wonder HDR Holdings?

1353
02:11:06,732 --> 02:11:07,073
And we do.

1354
02:11:08,920 --> 02:11:10,721
I'm going to turn it over to Councillor Scarpelli.

1355
02:11:10,761 --> 02:11:14,522
He's the chair of our Subcommittee on Licensing, Permitting, and Signs, and then we'll turn it over to you.

1356
02:11:14,942 --> 02:11:15,622
Councillor Scarpelli.

1357
02:11:16,122 --> 02:11:16,943
I'm sorry.

1358
02:11:17,123 --> 02:11:18,143
I appreciate it.

1359
02:11:18,163 --> 02:11:24,985
I know that everything looks like it's in order, but can you give us a description of what we do and what we're looking for?

1360
02:11:25,465 --> 02:11:25,665
Sure.

1361
02:11:26,526 --> 02:11:27,606
My name's Dan Brennan.

1362
02:11:27,666 --> 02:11:29,507
I handle permits and licenses for Wunder.

1363
02:11:30,347 --> 02:11:33,328
We're here for a convictual license with no alcohol.

1364
02:11:34,849 --> 02:11:40,254
Wonder is a new quick service restaurant concept that's expanding rapidly.

1365
02:11:40,994 --> 02:11:48,942
We have over 90 operating locations in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maryland, Virginia, and D.C.

1366
02:11:50,103 --> 02:11:55,128
We're working to open about 20 additional locations in the greater Boston area this year.

1367
02:11:56,965 --> 02:12:02,710
Wonder has solved many arguments on what's for dinner, what are we doing for takeout.

1368
02:12:03,510 --> 02:12:10,856
At Wonder, they've partnered with renowned chefs and restaurants to recreate their recipes under one platform.

1369
02:12:12,350 --> 02:12:17,691
At Wonder you can get a Bobby Flay steak dinner, a Samuel Markeson fried chicken dinner.

1370
02:12:17,931 --> 02:12:28,833
You can get Italian food, Chinese, Thai, with about 15 to 20 different menus in a variety of cuisines.

1371
02:12:29,713 --> 02:12:30,913
The choices seem endless.

1372
02:12:31,713 --> 02:12:34,814
At this location, it's just over 4,000 square feet.

1373
02:12:35,694 --> 02:12:38,795
It's mostly kitchen, but we do have 13 interior seats.

1374
02:12:41,036 --> 02:12:45,219
As you mentioned, hours of operation, 9, I'm sorry, 10 a.m.

1375
02:12:45,279 --> 02:12:46,781
to 11 p.m., seven days.

1376
02:12:47,762 --> 02:12:49,984
Hoping to open early February.

1377
02:12:50,004 --> 02:13:01,775
And this space is specifically located in the Wellington Station area in that building where the space where Walgreens used to be, it was subdivided.

1378
02:13:02,235 --> 02:13:03,897
So that's where our space will be.

1379
02:13:05,577 --> 02:13:05,777
Great.

1380
02:13:06,297 --> 02:13:06,677
One second.

1381
02:13:06,777 --> 02:13:07,438
Just your microphone.

1382
02:13:07,878 --> 02:13:10,818
And I'm only I'm only going to mess with you a little bit here.

1383
02:13:11,379 --> 02:13:14,880
You said Samuel Marcus and it's Marcus Samuelson and he's one of my favorite.

1384
02:13:14,940 --> 02:13:15,200
Oh yeah.

1385
02:13:15,340 --> 02:13:15,580
Sorry.

1386
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:17,720
I'm excited.

1387
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:18,361
Scarfelli.

1388
02:13:20,161 --> 02:13:21,141
Don't mess with that fool.

1389
02:13:22,962 --> 02:13:25,763
But like I said I appreciate the business.

1390
02:13:25,823 --> 02:13:30,064
I think that everything seems in order to move approval after my colleagues have any questions.

1391
02:13:30,084 --> 02:13:33,685
Do you have any questions for members of the council about this kind of exercise.

1392
02:13:36,043 --> 02:13:39,407
Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Sang.

1393
02:13:41,309 --> 02:13:41,889
All those in favor?

1394
02:13:42,149 --> 02:13:42,350
Aye.

1395
02:13:42,770 --> 02:13:43,090
Opposed?

1396
02:13:43,151 --> 02:13:43,671
Motion passes.

1397
02:13:43,691 --> 02:13:43,971
Thank you.

1398
02:13:44,332 --> 02:13:44,632
Thank you.

1399
02:13:45,233 --> 02:13:45,553
Good luck.

1400
02:13:45,573 --> 02:13:47,855
Sometimes in this room you wait two hours for five minutes.

1401
02:13:47,915 --> 02:13:49,017
Yeah, sorry about that.

1402
02:13:49,037 --> 02:13:49,537
No problem.

1403
02:13:49,637 --> 02:13:51,459
Thanks for all the work you guys have done.

1404
02:13:51,479 --> 02:13:53,862
I see the faces of others who are waiting even longer.

1405
02:13:55,244 --> 02:13:56,024
All right.

1406
02:13:56,585 --> 02:14:00,907
Petition for common victor's license, Colwyn Management, DBA Medford Hyatt Place.

1407
02:14:02,267 --> 02:14:09,931
This is to certify common victor's license as hereby granted to Colwyn Management, Inc., DBA Medford Hyatt Place, 116 Riverside Ave.

1408
02:14:10,711 --> 02:14:12,072
Hours of operation, 6 a.m.

1409
02:14:12,092 --> 02:14:14,833
to 1 a.m., 7 days a week.

1410
02:14:15,733 --> 02:14:17,734
And everything looks to be in order.

1411
02:14:17,754 --> 02:14:19,815
We do have a representative, Councillor Scarpelli.

1412
02:14:20,095 --> 02:14:21,336
Do you want me to recognize them first?

1413
02:14:23,617 --> 02:14:24,618
I see Kevin Butler.

1414
02:14:25,458 --> 02:14:26,679
Kevin, I'm gonna unmute you.

1415
02:14:26,699 --> 02:14:31,541
If you could just provide us with your name and address and let us know a bit about this license.

1416
02:14:33,182 --> 02:14:35,263
Yeah, good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

1417
02:14:35,823 --> 02:14:40,786
My name is Kevin Butler from McDermott, Quilty, Miller & Hanley out at 28 State Street in Boston.

1418
02:14:41,306 --> 02:14:43,327
Here tonight on behalf of Coleman Management Inc.

1419
02:14:43,527 --> 02:14:51,671
doing business as Medford Hyatt Place in their application for a new CV license to be exercised at the existing hotel at 116 Riverside.

1420
02:14:53,532 --> 02:14:56,654
This application comes as a result as a change of ownership.

1421
02:14:57,515 --> 02:15:01,317
There will be no operational changes from the previous CV license.

1422
02:15:02,578 --> 02:15:04,940
The food service will remain 6 a.m.

1423
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:05,460
to 1 a.m.

1424
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:06,261
seven days a week.

1425
02:15:07,381 --> 02:15:10,823
Food is served in the lobby area and there is no room service.

1426
02:15:12,312 --> 02:15:22,678
Additionally, the applicant has transferred the inholder alcoholic beverages license at the property, which was approved by the License Commission and is now pending ABCC review.

1427
02:15:23,759 --> 02:15:25,240
Just some background on the applicant.

1428
02:15:26,220 --> 02:15:33,705
They operate numerous hotels in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, including Town Place Suites and the EC Hotel here in Medford.

1429
02:15:35,666 --> 02:15:39,088
Thank you guys for hearing this and I'm happy to answer any questions.

1430
02:15:40,686 --> 02:15:40,986
Thank you.

1431
02:15:41,046 --> 02:15:41,767
Councilor Scarbelli.

1432
02:15:41,907 --> 02:15:43,028
Thank you, Mr. President.

1433
02:15:43,108 --> 02:15:53,896
Mr. Velikance, I know that, um, a question that is, does that mean, I know it's, it's, it seems pretty straightforward, but one of the questions is, does this mean they're putting in like a nightclub in the Hyatt?

1434
02:15:54,536 --> 02:15:59,580
And is that a nice, um, and I, I, I'm dispel those rumors.

1435
02:15:59,720 --> 02:16:03,563
Everything stays the same and everything just shifts over to the new management.

1436
02:16:03,583 --> 02:16:03,923
Correct?

1437
02:16:04,664 --> 02:16:05,064
Correct.

1438
02:16:06,665 --> 02:16:09,848
So, like I said, Mr. President, I see everything in place to move approval.

1439
02:16:11,570 --> 02:16:14,231
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by?

1440
02:16:14,751 --> 02:16:15,471
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

1441
02:16:15,491 --> 02:16:17,052
Any further questions by members of the council?

1442
02:16:18,392 --> 02:16:19,573
Councilor Millane, you're looking at me.

1443
02:16:20,453 --> 02:16:21,974
No question from Councilor Millane yet?

1444
02:16:21,994 --> 02:16:23,214
Come on, you have a question.

1445
02:16:27,095 --> 02:16:29,496
We're waiting with bated breath for your first question.

1446
02:16:30,216 --> 02:16:30,537
All right.

1447
02:16:31,157 --> 02:16:32,937
On the motion, all those in favor?

1448
02:16:32,957 --> 02:16:33,698
Aye.

1449
02:16:33,878 --> 02:16:34,378
Opposed?

1450
02:16:34,418 --> 02:16:35,438
The motion passes.

1451
02:16:37,319 --> 02:16:38,399
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

1452
02:16:38,419 --> 02:16:39,420
Thank you.

1453
02:16:39,440 --> 02:16:39,800
Thank you.

1454
02:16:39,880 --> 02:16:40,380
Thank you, Kevin.

1455
02:16:43,912 --> 02:16:51,316
2-6-0-0-8, whereas City Clerk Adam Alherdeby officially stepped down from his office on December 31st, 2025.

1456
02:16:51,517 --> 02:16:57,700
Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford City Council that we confirm that Assistant City Clerk Richard Alicio, Jr.

1457
02:16:57,740 --> 02:17:05,005
is serving as the acting City Clerk pursuant to state law, city charter, and city ordinances until such time that the City Council votes to appoint a permanent City Clerk.

1458
02:17:07,266 --> 02:17:11,829
Pretty self-explanatory, Adam had been on leave and his

1459
02:17:13,728 --> 02:17:15,270
His last day was December 31st.

1460
02:17:16,971 --> 02:17:28,399
In the past few months, Rich has been serving in the duties of the city clerk but now that office is vacant and for, as you may have noticed on the previous paper, Adam's name was still on the convictioner's license.

1461
02:17:29,280 --> 02:17:32,262
Now we need someone's name to go on everything and the seal.

1462
02:17:32,983 --> 02:17:37,486
The city clerk is an important role under state law and now that it is officially vacant,

1463
02:17:39,805 --> 02:17:43,208
Rich is the acting clerk and we need to confirm that.

1464
02:17:44,069 --> 02:17:47,953
So that is where we are at and I see Councillor Scarpelli.

1465
02:17:49,573 --> 02:17:55,498
I would, I'm going to ask to approve this resolution, but I'd like to add something if I can.

1466
02:17:55,519 --> 02:18:05,087
I think if Rich is accepted into that role as we move forward, I think he should be compensated out of great pay for the job that he is doing.

1467
02:18:05,127 --> 02:18:12,533
I think until we solidify our new clerk that Rich is compensated with the same rate of pay as the clerk.

1468
02:18:13,214 --> 02:18:14,275
I hope my colleagues can,

1469
02:18:16,155 --> 02:18:20,277
vote in favor of that with me, so that would be an addition to the motion.

1470
02:18:22,338 --> 02:18:33,202
So we have an amendment to add that the acting clerk will be paid the same amount as the ordinances say that the city clerk should be paid?

1471
02:18:33,242 --> 02:18:33,803
Correct, please.

1472
02:18:34,063 --> 02:18:34,423
Thank you.

1473
02:18:35,483 --> 02:18:37,384
And that amendment is seconded by Councillor Callahan.

1474
02:18:37,404 --> 02:18:38,925
Do we have any further discussion on that amendment?

1475
02:18:43,320 --> 02:18:49,421
Seeing none, on the motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by?

1476
02:18:52,062 --> 02:18:53,402
By seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1477
02:18:53,943 --> 02:18:54,303
Thank you.

1478
02:18:58,984 --> 02:19:00,864
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1479
02:19:04,205 --> 02:19:04,945
Councilor Callahan?

1480
02:19:04,965 --> 02:19:05,045
Yes.

1481
02:19:07,746 --> 02:19:08,746
Vice President Lazaro?

1482
02:19:08,766 --> 02:19:08,886
Yes.

1483
02:19:11,987 --> 02:19:12,727
Councilor Lemming?

1484
02:19:14,270 --> 02:19:15,290
Councilor Scarpelli.

1485
02:19:15,611 --> 02:19:15,891
Yes.

1486
02:19:16,451 --> 02:19:17,251
Councilor Seng.

1487
02:19:17,271 --> 02:19:17,331
Yes.

1488
02:19:19,112 --> 02:19:19,732
Councilor Millan.

1489
02:19:19,752 --> 02:19:19,832
Yes.

1490
02:19:21,173 --> 02:19:21,993
And President Beers.

1491
02:19:22,113 --> 02:19:22,373
Yes.

1492
02:19:22,474 --> 02:19:23,194
Everything affirmative.

1493
02:19:23,254 --> 02:19:23,854
None in the negative.

1494
02:19:23,894 --> 02:19:27,736
The motion passes.

1495
02:19:27,756 --> 02:19:27,736
26009.

1496
02:19:28,536 --> 02:19:31,057
And you sent me some changes on this one didn't you Matt.

1497
02:19:36,003 --> 02:19:36,844
Yeah, I see it.

1498
02:19:38,065 --> 02:19:47,033
I'll read it from the email, but we have 26009 resolution to support SMFA professors at Tufts pursuing a fair contract sponsored by Councilor Lemming and President Behrs.

1499
02:19:48,151 --> 02:19:56,498
Whereas the city of Medford recognizes the vital role that artists and educators play in enriching civic life and affirms the right of all workers to collectively bargain and be treated with dignity and respect.

1500
02:19:57,139 --> 02:20:07,348
And whereas the professors of the practice at Tufts University School of Museum of Fine Arts are dedicated full-time professors in practicing artists whose instruction, mentorship and creative work are the backbone

1501
02:20:07,868 --> 02:20:30,778
of the SMFA's academic excellence, whereas SFMA professors of the practice are currently engaged in contract negotiations seeking a fair agreement that addresses issues including salaries that keep pace with the cost of living, equitable promotion, and review practices, manageable workloads, and basic institutional support, and whereas faculty have been reporting that bargaining has not been going well and Tufts has attempted to silence local union members while failing to meaningfully address their concerns.

1502
02:20:31,358 --> 02:20:42,868
And whereas student enrollment at SMFA has tripled in recent years, the number of full-time professors of the practice has dropped from 40 to 27, with the university refusing to fill vacancies overburdening current faculty.

1503
02:20:43,408 --> 02:20:56,699
Whereas current compensation is unsustainable for faculty who have to cover added costs such as studio space essential for them to perform their job, forcing 11 faculty members to live out of state, professors of the practice are requesting a 3% cost of living increase for three years and 3.25% for two years after that.

1504
02:20:58,420 --> 02:21:03,847
But Tufts has offered only 2.75%, alongside salary minimums that fall well below those of peer institutions.

1505
02:21:04,447 --> 02:21:16,541
And whereas BIPOC and international faculty face additional barriers, including inequitable treatment compared to colleagues on the main campus, and delayed or inconsistent visa support that has left international faculty in precarious legal and employment situations.

1506
02:21:17,202 --> 02:21:33,229
And whereas at a time when institutions of higher education, international students and faculty in the arts are under threat nationwide, Tufts University's failure to adequately support its SFMA faculty jeopardizes not only their livelihoods but also the long-term health and reputation of the university and its contributions to the city of Medford.

1507
02:21:33,649 --> 02:21:45,714
Now therefore, be it resolved that the Medford City Council stands in solidarity with the SFMA, SMFA, professors of the practice at Tufts University in the pursuit of a fair contract, supports the rights of all workers to organize without fear and retribution,

1508
02:21:46,414 --> 02:22:07,773
Fear of retribution and urges Tufts to bargain in good faith by addressing faculty concerns regarding salary, equity, and institutional support and be it further resolved that the council recognizes SMFA faculty as essential contributors to the cultural and educational vitality of the city of Medford and calls on Tufts University to uphold its stated values of equity, inclusion, and academic excellence by investing in its faculty accordingly.

1509
02:22:08,474 --> 02:22:10,756
And Councilor Lemming, I hope that I just gave your speech for you.

1510
02:22:10,896 --> 02:22:11,477
Councilor Lemming.

1511
02:22:13,333 --> 02:22:14,273
Well, thank you.

1512
02:22:14,373 --> 02:22:28,776
So this is essentially the same resolution that the Boston City Council passed in August to support Tufts professors of the practice at the university's School Museum and Fine Arts.

1513
02:22:29,016 --> 02:22:35,298
Unfortunately, negotiations still haven't really gotten anywhere between this particular resolution.

1514
02:22:37,798 --> 02:22:40,422
union and the university.

1515
02:22:40,462 --> 02:22:46,610
So I figured Tufts is in the city of Medford and we could also lend our support to their efforts as well.

1516
02:22:47,512 --> 02:22:53,560
Being an academic and being in that role for a long time is difficult.

1517
02:22:54,441 --> 02:22:54,601
It's

1518
02:22:56,242 --> 02:23:06,229
You, this is, and this is a role, these professors of the practice, this is not a tenure track position, which is sort of the only point in your career that you get any sort of safety within academia.

1519
02:23:07,610 --> 02:23:15,856
When you're in these systems, you're usually striving, you're usually working very long hours at very low pay with very little institutional support.

1520
02:23:17,537 --> 02:23:20,198
it's some of the finest minds in the country do this.

1521
02:23:20,618 --> 02:23:22,438
So it's difficult to keep doing that.

1522
02:23:22,458 --> 02:23:41,363
And once again, we have an institution that is in our city that is failing to support many of the people that contribute to the livelihood of this city, that contribute to Tufts University itself, that are teaching the next generation of artists, of curators, and so on.

1523
02:23:43,270 --> 02:23:52,994
The change that I asked Council President Barris to make were there were two changes in the original document.

1524
02:23:53,374 --> 02:24:04,778
I was informed by the union shortly before this meeting, which is that the professors of practice in the original document on the agenda said they were demanding a 4 percent cost of living increase.

1525
02:24:04,798 --> 02:24:06,459
They're now just demanding 3.25 percent for

1526
02:24:11,594 --> 02:24:16,018
a 3% cost of living increase for the first three years and 3.25% after that.

1527
02:24:16,679 --> 02:24:27,370
Inflation usually averages out to 3.1%, so cost of living increases that are less than 3% are basically just shrinking your salary over time.

1528
02:24:28,811 --> 02:24:40,841
The number of full-time faculty, the number of full-time professors of the practice has dropped from 30 to 27 since the Boston City Council passed its resolution.

1529
02:24:40,901 --> 02:24:51,029
So people are leaving because of the continuous strain on their positions and the, let's say, not ideal working conditions that they're facing.

1530
02:24:51,951 --> 02:24:58,032
Everybody in this economy, increasingly, is under some sort of financial strain.

1531
02:24:58,673 --> 02:25:12,256
And the pattern that we keep seeing is institutions, top-down, trying to strain the people who are working lower down in the food chain to make ends meet, because those people have less power.

1532
02:25:12,976 --> 02:25:21,378
And this is just one small group of people that are trying to fight to keep their... to keep doing the work that they do,

1533
02:25:22,638 --> 02:25:28,739
that they're good at that contributes to society while still putting bread on the table.

1534
02:25:29,239 --> 02:25:32,520
So thank you all for listening.

1535
02:25:34,821 --> 02:25:41,382
Supporting any sort of academic unions is something that's close to me because of my own time in academia when I realized how hard it was.

1536
02:25:41,602 --> 02:25:45,023
And I hope that I can count on the support of this council.

1537
02:25:46,323 --> 02:25:46,963
Thank you for listening.

1538
02:25:49,063 --> 02:25:49,423
Thank you.

1539
02:25:49,483 --> 02:25:53,224
On the motion of Councilor Lemming, seconded by, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

1540
02:25:53,904 --> 02:25:54,584
You want to speak on this?

1541
02:25:55,184 --> 02:25:55,384
Great.

1542
02:25:57,385 --> 02:25:59,505
Name and address for the record and you'll have three minutes.

1543
02:26:01,266 --> 02:26:01,546
Okay.

1544
02:26:02,126 --> 02:26:04,246
Simon Alcindor, 44 Tainter Street.

1545
02:26:04,326 --> 02:26:06,007
I just wanted to give something really brief.

1546
02:26:07,027 --> 02:26:16,289
Coming from as a, I'm currently a student at Suffolk University where we are having much of a similar issue with universities being unwilling to

1547
02:26:16,869 --> 02:26:18,210
fairly compensate their professors.

1548
02:26:18,230 --> 02:26:22,312
In fact, reading through this, a lot of this is very much the same stuff that we struggle with.

1549
02:26:23,132 --> 02:26:29,615
Universities refusing to replace faculty and not actually adjusting anything to match cost of living.

1550
02:26:30,555 --> 02:26:41,481
And I just wanted to mention that because that just shows why this resolution is so important in showing that we are, indeed, supporting our faculty and making sure that our

1551
02:26:42,421 --> 02:26:49,724
universities that are faculty are able to continue doing things because this is what leads to having more stable universities as a whole.

1552
02:26:49,764 --> 02:27:03,010
That's something that we've been struggling with at Suffolk is that professors keep on leaving because, well, pay is too low and they cannot afford to continue working there while the university refuses to

1553
02:27:04,211 --> 02:27:05,252
to replace those positions.

1554
02:27:05,312 --> 02:27:12,499
So it's really critical that we are able to support our professors, our faculty through things like this.

1555
02:27:12,519 --> 02:27:14,641
Yeah, thank you.

1556
02:27:16,683 --> 02:27:17,363
Thank you so much, Simon.

1557
02:27:17,403 --> 02:27:20,066
All right.

1558
02:27:20,226 --> 02:27:22,308
On the motion of Councilman Lemming, seconded by.

1559
02:27:24,357 --> 02:27:25,958
Councilor Callahan, sorry.

1560
02:27:27,258 --> 02:27:28,919
I have some sort of blindness around this.

1561
02:27:32,920 --> 02:27:33,801
All those in favor?

1562
02:27:35,081 --> 02:27:35,601
Opposed?

1563
02:27:35,821 --> 02:27:39,343
Motion passes.

1564
02:27:39,363 --> 02:27:51,968
26010, resolution to hold the public forum and draft ordinance regarding city services on private ways, whereas the city administration is offered by Councilor Scarpelli, whereas the city administration has implemented a policy of service denial to residents of Medford that reside on private ways.

1565
02:27:52,828 --> 02:28:00,130
Whereas the city administration's policy forces the financial responsibilities of infrastructure repair upon residents in private ways, creating an additional financial burden on residents.

1566
02:28:00,230 --> 02:28:08,011
And whereas the city administration has denied these residents basic repairs and maintenance to neighborhood streets, sidewalks, trees, creating safety, quality of life, and equity issues.

1567
02:28:08,051 --> 02:28:16,233
Now, therefore, be it resolved that the city council address the disparity in services provided to residents in private ways in a public forum with the necessary department heads and policy makers.

1568
02:28:16,633 --> 02:28:20,194
And be it further resolved that the city council draft an equity of services ordinances that prohibits

1569
02:28:20,574 --> 02:28:23,535
The refusal of basic city services to residents in private ways.

1570
02:28:23,615 --> 02:28:24,795
Councilor Scarpelli.

1571
02:28:25,876 --> 02:28:26,956
Thank you, Mr. President.

1572
02:28:27,016 --> 02:28:30,857
So I think that this is important because I do want to correct one thing.

1573
02:28:30,897 --> 02:28:34,718
I know that this has to be corrected a little bit.

1574
02:28:34,758 --> 02:28:38,199
I know that I believe this is a law.

1575
02:28:38,239 --> 02:28:42,461
It isn't something that our team is implementing.

1576
02:28:42,901 --> 02:28:46,342
They're just following through what's stated now in our rules.

1577
02:28:50,700 --> 02:29:00,648
And I'm very fortunate because I think that anytime we do have an issue, Director McGibbon is always responsible to the residents.

1578
02:29:00,688 --> 02:29:05,131
He's always returning calls, always reaching out, making sure they're educated.

1579
02:29:05,191 --> 02:29:12,056
But what we're seeing right now is really the lack of understanding the total picture.

1580
02:29:12,096 --> 02:29:19,962
And I think that we really have to draft some sort of communication with all the residents and really inform all of our

1581
02:29:20,533 --> 02:29:29,956
residents on private ways, what the responsibilities of our city holds, and then what their responsibilities are.

1582
02:29:31,676 --> 02:29:39,799
We've had concerns at so many different avenues that people have been reaching out, and it's getting to the point where this is why I put this resolution through, is try to

1583
02:29:40,945 --> 02:29:44,526
have a forum where people can understand the intricacies.

1584
02:29:44,566 --> 02:29:48,607
I mean, one resident said, well, George, our neighborhood understands it.

1585
02:29:49,067 --> 02:29:53,268
And our neighborhood all kicked in, and we paved our street.

1586
02:29:53,688 --> 02:30:06,112
And then the city did some roadwork, and they diverted all the heavy trucking that was being done with roadwork onto our new street, which has now damaged our street.

1587
02:30:06,592 --> 02:30:09,113
So these are the questions that people are asking.

1588
02:30:11,043 --> 02:30:16,148
Again, whether it's true or not, this is the questions people are asking, that where does it fall into?

1589
02:30:16,328 --> 02:30:17,369
Whose responsibility?

1590
02:30:17,870 --> 02:30:27,399
If something, if it is fixed, and then something that brings, comes to the city's process, that then leads to any

1591
02:30:30,322 --> 02:30:33,283
destruction, who fixes that?

1592
02:30:33,724 --> 02:30:40,146
The other concerns are the neighbors that are calling that, you know, sidewalks, sidewalks that are dangerous.

1593
02:30:40,226 --> 02:30:48,670
And we have elderly neighbors and unfortunately being told that they can't trim trees or they can't replace those sidewalks because it's a private way.

1594
02:30:49,831 --> 02:30:55,133
And then understanding what the responsibility of this council is when there is a lawsuit when someone falls.

1595
02:30:55,633 --> 02:30:59,295
Because that doesn't, these situations still fall back on us.

1596
02:31:00,035 --> 02:31:08,181
So, and I think that there's so much that has to be really shared with the community so everybody understands.

1597
02:31:08,221 --> 02:31:19,788
I know that, you know, dispelling a lot of issues where residents are calling me and saying that in private ways that, is it true the city's not going to plow my private way anymore?

1598
02:31:21,409 --> 02:31:23,231
And I personally haven't seen that.

1599
02:31:24,126 --> 02:31:26,528
So I don't know where that's coming from.

1600
02:31:27,448 --> 02:31:35,614
I know that we all were part of an email with a resident that was confused about plowing a private driveway.

1601
02:31:35,654 --> 02:31:41,418
And I think Mr. McGibbon was very good in explaining it and understanding it and the situation.

1602
02:31:41,478 --> 02:31:46,901
But these are just part of the concerns that residents have reached out and asked.

1603
02:31:48,462 --> 02:31:49,263
And again, different

1604
02:31:49,948 --> 02:31:52,110
different administrations looked at this differently.

1605
02:31:52,790 --> 02:31:57,413
If you look at Mayor McGlynn, he treated it, even though it was a private way, he treated it as a public way.

1606
02:31:58,194 --> 02:32:01,676
He did everything no different than private, and that hurts.

1607
02:32:02,336 --> 02:32:08,180
You know, we also talked about possibly looking in, how do we make our private ways public?

1608
02:32:08,461 --> 02:32:12,303
And it sounds easy, but we also know that's not very easy to do.

1609
02:32:12,703 --> 02:32:16,206
It's very expensive, because you have to tie in so many different

1610
02:32:16,706 --> 02:32:20,569
pieces of infrastructure that has to be done by this administration.

1611
02:32:20,990 --> 02:32:26,995
So there's a lot of variables, but I think right now, when I wrote this resolution, it was a little different.

1612
02:32:27,435 --> 02:32:43,328
But I think that as we're moving forward, I think the key part to this resolution is really finding a way to have a community meeting or finding some documentation or a checklist that people that live on private ways can understand truly what

1613
02:32:44,502 --> 02:32:45,883
can be done and what can't be done.

1614
02:32:46,143 --> 02:32:58,413
Because I think that's what the biggest response, the most contact I've had with residents saying, wait a second, George, they're not fixing my sidewalk.

1615
02:32:58,453 --> 02:33:01,816
They're not taking down a tree that was on the list back in 2021.

1616
02:33:03,197 --> 02:33:07,039
I mean, these are every single day now we're getting private way questions.

1617
02:33:07,519 --> 02:33:08,860
And, you know, we have neighbors.

1618
02:33:08,900 --> 02:33:19,425
We have, you know, that we reached out and we had a neighbor that was concerned about his neighbor that has Alzheimer's that traverses the sidewalk, but unfortunately it's a dangerous sidewalk.

1619
02:33:19,585 --> 02:33:20,246
What can we do?

1620
02:33:21,466 --> 02:33:25,808
The neighbor doesn't have the means to fix that financially.

1621
02:33:26,348 --> 02:33:29,210
And obviously the burden on the city, legally, can we do it?

1622
02:33:29,912 --> 02:33:42,097
So I think that understanding that people can understand what the legalities are to the private ways and then spell out what the processes are and what they're supposed to do and what they can do.

1623
02:33:42,458 --> 02:33:47,660
And then down the line, you know, are there, you know, ask, I can ask Tim now that understands it.

1624
02:33:48,040 --> 02:33:50,521
Are we not plowing private roads right now?

1625
02:33:50,581 --> 02:33:52,122
Because I think that, um,

1626
02:33:52,835 --> 02:33:55,337
That was a concern going into like a first snowstorm.

1627
02:33:55,397 --> 02:33:57,938
It's like, oh, if we don't do it, what happens?

1628
02:33:57,978 --> 02:34:00,740
Can a fire engine get down my street if somebody gets sick?

1629
02:34:01,280 --> 02:34:04,822
These are the questions that have been asked of me to bring forward.

1630
02:34:05,422 --> 02:34:21,912
And I just ask my council colleagues to support, at least right now, the process of getting our communication and holding a public forum that we can educate our residents and give them that opportunity that they can ask questions

1631
02:34:22,572 --> 02:34:24,433
and then get the truer results.

1632
02:34:25,633 --> 02:34:29,515
Unfortunately, without a city solicitor, this is the problem when you write something like this.

1633
02:34:30,155 --> 02:34:34,377
You write it and then not understand it until you talk to someone that has a legal background.

1634
02:34:34,797 --> 02:34:37,018
So KP Law, they don't respond to us.

1635
02:34:37,478 --> 02:34:42,120
So not having Mr. Foley here, I can't call and say, hey, let me run this by you.

1636
02:34:42,200 --> 02:34:43,300
What is A, B, and C?

1637
02:34:43,721 --> 02:34:49,563
And the city, the attorney that I did talk with that is a city solicitor mentioned to me, George,

1638
02:34:50,714 --> 02:35:07,984
And to all due respect to your leadership team here in Medford, you really need a person with a legal background to help answer some of these questions, because it is a very difficult and very confusing process.

1639
02:35:08,604 --> 02:35:12,086
And it's not as easy as I just put it.

1640
02:35:12,126 --> 02:35:15,488
Let's put together a bullet point that we can do that.

1641
02:35:15,508 --> 02:35:16,388
But we have to do something.

1642
02:35:16,748 --> 02:35:19,110
So I ask my colleagues to.

1643
02:35:20,132 --> 02:35:34,979
share their thoughts and maybe there's a different avenue through this motion, this resolution, that we can do something to help our residents in private ways traverse upcoming issues and concerns that they know they're going to have.

1644
02:35:36,380 --> 02:35:41,842
And again, there's also the angry ones that call and saying, my taxes are high and I'm not getting the same services.

1645
02:35:41,902 --> 02:35:42,642
This is wrong.

1646
02:35:42,702 --> 02:35:43,483
Shame on the city.

1647
02:35:43,923 --> 02:35:45,264
You know, it's all Zach Baez's fault.

1648
02:35:45,284 --> 02:35:45,604
I said, no,

1649
02:35:49,398 --> 02:36:12,535
But if we can, I ask you to at least say, you know, to even just amend this motion at the point right now that we at least have, you know, bring this back down and just ask for some sort of communication with the residents of Private Ways and then work with them to try to see if there's an option for ordinance change or anything to that matter.

1650
02:36:12,756 --> 02:36:14,417
So thank you for indulging me.

1651
02:36:15,298 --> 02:36:20,400
Thank you, and I really enjoy watching the caption service try to say my name.

1652
02:36:20,420 --> 02:36:21,241
It never gets it right.

1653
02:36:23,902 --> 02:36:24,082
Yeah.

1654
02:36:26,183 --> 02:36:26,623
Fair enough.

1655
02:36:28,104 --> 02:36:32,786
I just want to note one thing before I go to, uh-oh.

1656
02:36:33,787 --> 02:36:34,027
Oh, no.

1657
02:36:34,207 --> 02:36:36,988
I thought there was a Liz in there for a second, but still no Liz.

1658
02:36:38,269 --> 02:36:41,151
We have counselors Callahan, Lemming, and then Lazaro, and then Callahan.

1659
02:36:41,191 --> 02:36:43,212
But I just wanted to note as well.

1660
02:36:44,846 --> 02:36:48,307
that we have a parking on private ways resource on the city website.

1661
02:36:48,347 --> 02:36:52,488
And then Councilor Lemming, which I'm guessing he might talk about, did kind of an overview last year.

1662
02:36:52,508 --> 02:36:57,090
We had some great meetings in 2022 and 2023 around private ways.

1663
02:36:57,110 --> 02:37:06,513
And I think it might behoove us to coordinate with the communications team around just a basic FAQ type thing, like Councilor Scarpelli is talking about, FAQ checklist.

1664
02:37:07,433 --> 02:37:21,721
The information's out there, some of it's in meeting videos, some of it's on the parking department, and I think it's just, you know, what's the go-to information around private ways so that when residents have questions, they understand the law, as you noted, so.

1665
02:37:24,950 --> 02:37:37,075
That's perfect, but I really think that what was repeated back to me is really giving them an audience where they can actually talk to the people that have made these decisions or are having to enforce these decisions.

1666
02:37:37,135 --> 02:37:37,615
So, thank you.

1667
02:37:37,635 --> 02:37:38,336
Absolutely, yeah.

1668
02:37:38,356 --> 02:37:42,878
And I just wanted to, maybe we could develop that resource and then have the forum on it.

1669
02:37:42,898 --> 02:37:49,541
So, just my two cents because I, you know, Private Ways are back again and they never go away because we have a lot of Private Ways here in Medford.

1670
02:37:51,383 --> 02:37:52,704
And that causes us some trouble.

1671
02:37:52,984 --> 02:37:57,427
So I'll go to Councilor Lemming, then Councilor Vice President Lazaro, then Councilor Callahan.

1672
02:37:57,728 --> 02:38:02,011
Thank you for bringing this resolution forward.

1673
02:38:02,031 --> 02:38:11,158
I did write a little piece on my personal website about private ways where I did a little bit of research into this.

1674
02:38:11,378 --> 02:38:19,704
And the conclusion that I came to is that private ways are my least favorite topic to talk about with residents whenever they bring it up.

1675
02:38:21,043 --> 02:38:29,069
It's, no, it is very frustrating because it seems to be a lose-lose situation and it's very confusing.

1676
02:38:29,410 --> 02:38:35,714
Because one, private ways, I believe, are largely governed by the state.

1677
02:38:35,794 --> 02:38:49,004
Like, whereas it's, we have the ability to write ordinances about most things in the city, but my impression in the research that I did was that what governs private ways is largely

1678
02:38:49,632 --> 02:38:50,192
state law.

1679
02:38:51,052 --> 02:39:13,336
And I would like to make a motion to request, get a memo from legal KP law requesting clarification on what cities can and cannot do with private ways in terms of what ordinances that we can write, just so that we have some sort of official memo to point to.

1680
02:39:14,056 --> 02:39:16,236
And if they say it's state law, then we can point to that.

1681
02:39:16,296 --> 02:39:19,017
If they say there are some things we can do with private ways, then

1682
02:39:19,477 --> 02:39:23,279
We could potentially work on that, but I would like to make a motion just to have that memo.

1683
02:39:31,220 --> 02:39:41,083
The reason that Medford has so many private ways is because essentially developers built a lot of houses in the cities in places that didn't have roads, so they made their own roads.

1684
02:39:41,443 --> 02:39:43,703
But those roads were very low quality.

1685
02:39:44,263 --> 02:39:49,765
They didn't put a lot of money into actually making them because that would have increased building costs.

1686
02:39:50,685 --> 02:39:58,608
And there was a law passed in like the mid 1800s in Massachusetts which said that you can't just give a road to a city.

1687
02:39:59,008 --> 02:40:04,769
Like that's not something you can do because if the road isn't up to snuff, then suddenly it's the city's responsibility to maintain it.

1688
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:13,612
And it wouldn't be fiscally responsible of us to have to maintain a very low quality road that we had nothing to do with building.

1689
02:40:14,072 --> 02:40:15,833
So officially the way that

1690
02:40:16,953 --> 02:40:36,527
residents can put a private way to the city's responsibility is to put up a ton of money themselves, repair it, to bring it up to snuff, and then get at least half the people who own the private way to sign, then I believe there's a process where the DPW reviews it, then the city council would have to prove it.

1691
02:40:37,828 --> 02:40:39,949
I don't know if anybody's actually gone through that process.

1692
02:40:40,009 --> 02:40:53,197
It's a very tedious legal process, or, which it sounds like my colleague talked about previously, and I would love to hear Tim McGivern talk about.

1693
02:40:54,978 --> 02:41:06,685
I would love to hear Tim McGivern talk about this process for making private ways public, since it does seem like he did want to chime in.

1694
02:41:08,754 --> 02:41:10,497
I didn't wanna do like a Tim chant.

1695
02:41:10,737 --> 02:41:11,498
Tim, Tim.

1696
02:41:11,538 --> 02:41:14,923
If you say Tim three times, he appears in the mirror talking about private ways.

1697
02:41:16,986 --> 02:41:20,691
I'm afraid I don't... Did I give any wrong information there?

1698
02:41:20,711 --> 02:41:22,033
I just like... Probably a little bit.

1699
02:41:22,053 --> 02:41:22,954
I always do.

1700
02:41:22,994 --> 02:41:23,375
Yeah, sure.

1701
02:41:24,993 --> 02:41:27,496
Go ahead, Tim.

1702
02:41:27,716 --> 02:41:27,956
Thank you.

1703
02:41:27,996 --> 02:41:29,618
I just wanted to chime in.

1704
02:41:29,658 --> 02:41:31,260
It's actually maybe tedious.

1705
02:41:31,280 --> 02:41:31,960
I think that's correct.

1706
02:41:32,241 --> 02:41:36,385
But all the public ways that we have in the city went through that process.

1707
02:41:36,445 --> 02:41:37,847
So it's a pretty common process.

1708
02:41:38,147 --> 02:41:40,730
It's especially a long time ago.

1709
02:41:41,430 --> 02:41:45,655
And the poll and levy example that you came up with, you know, half the people vote in favor of it.

1710
02:41:46,295 --> 02:41:53,159
That was something that was common more in like the 80s when the city was trying to get private ways to become public ways.

1711
02:41:53,979 --> 02:41:57,741
So there is a way to do it, it just requires time and money.

1712
02:42:00,182 --> 02:42:04,524
So I just wanted to step in and just say that it is actually a common process.

1713
02:42:04,845 --> 02:42:07,466
It's done all over the state quite a lot.

1714
02:42:07,926 --> 02:42:10,948
The last time we did a taking was for

1715
02:42:14,520 --> 02:42:16,141
for portions of High Street.

1716
02:42:16,762 --> 02:42:22,586
The last subdivision that got approved here is the Mary Kenny Way subdivision.

1717
02:42:22,606 --> 02:42:24,267
So you're coming up here and you're saying I'm wrong.

1718
02:42:25,606 --> 02:42:26,907
Well, I'm not wrong.

1719
02:42:26,927 --> 02:42:37,513
I just want to make sure that folks understand that Mary Kinney Way is going to be the next taking that we do where the city engineer looks at the road.

1720
02:42:37,553 --> 02:42:39,194
We say, yep, it was built to city standards.

1721
02:42:39,854 --> 02:42:46,899
And then they petition the city council, or actually the community development board first, to recommend the taking to the city council.

1722
02:42:47,459 --> 02:42:48,880
And then the formal taking happens.

1723
02:42:49,720 --> 02:42:53,501
We did it also with Freedomway, but that was a little bit easier, and Steve Miller Drive.

1724
02:42:53,741 --> 02:42:58,022
Those were easier because we took it from the school department, which is a simpler process.

1725
02:42:59,462 --> 02:42:59,923
Anyway, thank you.

1726
02:43:02,423 --> 02:43:04,544
Yes, we do plow private ways.

1727
02:43:04,564 --> 02:43:04,744
Sorry.

1728
02:43:08,505 --> 02:43:10,285
No, no, no, I just wanted to.

1729
02:43:14,326 --> 02:43:18,027
Well, I just wanted to formalize the motion, maybe get a second on it.

1730
02:43:20,154 --> 02:43:33,407
I know, Tim, you responded and you reached out to me and I apologize I didn't get back to you because you always get back to me.

1731
02:43:33,507 --> 02:43:38,832
I truly wanted to speak to legalities before and then come here and make some changes.

1732
02:43:41,505 --> 02:43:45,948
Unfortunately, like I said, normally you talk to your city solicitor and he sets you straight.

1733
02:43:46,008 --> 02:43:46,968
Unfortunately, we don't have that.

1734
02:43:47,008 --> 02:43:50,951
So I apologize that I didn't follow up with you, but I appreciate your call.

1735
02:43:51,611 --> 02:43:59,355
I think it's a very salient point, the legal aspect, because I can only interpret it so far and receive advice and counsel myself.

1736
02:44:00,396 --> 02:44:01,697
And that's happened, obviously, over the years.

1737
02:44:02,425 --> 02:44:03,546
a couple decades I've been doing this.

1738
02:44:04,686 --> 02:44:12,310
But you are correct, there's a lot of gray area and a lot of situations that courts haven't seen when it comes to private ways.

1739
02:44:12,911 --> 02:44:13,051
So.

1740
02:44:13,831 --> 02:44:14,151
Thank you.

1741
02:44:14,171 --> 02:44:14,752
You're welcome.

1742
02:44:15,632 --> 02:44:16,473
All right, thanks Tim.

1743
02:44:17,513 --> 02:44:22,296
All right, gonna go to everybody, great.

1744
02:44:22,676 --> 02:44:24,017
Vice President Lazaro first.

1745
02:44:24,734 --> 02:44:25,094
Thank you.

1746
02:44:26,195 --> 02:44:35,844
I appreciate Councillor Scarpelli bringing this forward because we do get a lot of people reaching out with questions about this stuff still.

1747
02:44:36,384 --> 02:44:37,565
I know we've talked about it a lot.

1748
02:44:37,745 --> 02:44:41,208
I know it would be incredibly expensive because it was one of the first things I

1749
02:44:42,539 --> 02:44:48,342
wanted to try to address when I started performing this role a couple of years ago.

1750
02:44:49,423 --> 02:44:59,909
And I remember talking to President Behrs about the concept of addressing how many, it seemed like there was an inordinate number of private ways in the city of Medford, but

1751
02:45:01,253 --> 02:45:04,774
The cost was really astronomical to make them public.

1752
02:45:04,894 --> 02:45:05,834
I live on a private way.

1753
02:45:07,014 --> 02:45:07,815
It is plowed.

1754
02:45:08,575 --> 02:45:12,876
I don't know if me saying that is gonna make it not be plowed now.

1755
02:45:14,656 --> 02:45:17,397
I think Tim just confirmed that you're fine.

1756
02:45:17,597 --> 02:45:17,897
Oh boy.

1757
02:45:17,917 --> 02:45:19,237
You're fine.

1758
02:45:19,397 --> 02:45:20,178
Oh no.

1759
02:45:20,258 --> 02:45:20,678
Oh heaven.

1760
02:45:24,799 --> 02:45:27,699
It will be plowed, but it may disappear entirely.

1761
02:45:28,139 --> 02:45:29,600
Maybe you just dig the whole thing up.

1762
02:45:29,780 --> 02:45:30,060
I don't know.

1763
02:45:31,562 --> 02:45:32,803
Private ways are plowed.

1764
02:45:33,383 --> 02:45:33,824
Great.

1765
02:45:34,204 --> 02:45:34,844
End of story.

1766
02:45:35,025 --> 02:45:35,225
Great.

1767
02:45:35,325 --> 02:45:35,685
Love that.

1768
02:45:37,567 --> 02:45:37,747
Right.

1769
02:45:37,987 --> 02:45:40,469
So I know it can be very confusing for residents.

1770
02:45:40,489 --> 02:45:55,360
I do think it would be really great if we had a really comprehensive area of the website where people could figure out the answers to their questions, or if we just knew how to answer people and we didn't have to flood Mr. McGivern's emails all the time.

1771
02:45:56,757 --> 02:45:58,719
So, yes, because it can be really confusing.

1772
02:45:58,759 --> 02:46:02,521
So, I really support this measure, and I appreciate the effort a lot.

1773
02:46:02,781 --> 02:46:03,382
So, thank you.

1774
02:46:05,143 --> 02:46:06,524
Okay, what did I say wrong?

1775
02:46:08,104 --> 02:46:10,246
I just wanted to share resources.

1776
02:46:10,726 --> 02:46:11,166
Oh, yay.

1777
02:46:11,186 --> 02:46:12,027
Great.

1778
02:46:12,067 --> 02:46:12,287
Love that.

1779
02:46:12,327 --> 02:46:14,729
I've shared them before, but I think it's worth sharing them again.

1780
02:46:15,089 --> 02:46:18,691
So, the state website has an excellent resource on private ways.

1781
02:46:19,251 --> 02:46:23,514
It's really the go-to resources, and I think they do a pretty good job of keeping up to date.

1782
02:46:24,208 --> 02:46:30,669
Medford doesn't have a specific, you know, what can and can't happen in private ways, but Boston has a really good one and it's all the same set of laws.

1783
02:46:30,829 --> 02:46:33,030
So those are relevant.

1784
02:46:33,770 --> 02:46:45,433
And then Medford does have a very specific one on parking because we've spent probably more time on parking and what the rights are of the private way owners in regards to parking and what the city can and can't do.

1785
02:46:45,513 --> 02:46:47,553
So that should be pretty good.

1786
02:46:48,373 --> 02:46:53,454
And then just in general, if folks have questions about, hey, can I make my private way a public way?

1787
02:46:53,774 --> 02:46:55,394
The answer's usually yes.

1788
02:46:55,594 --> 02:47:00,335
And someone like me or Owen in the engineering department can kind of go through that process.

1789
02:47:00,515 --> 02:47:03,136
So that's always, we're always welcome to receive those calls.

1790
02:47:03,436 --> 02:47:04,896
I enjoy talking about private ways.

1791
02:47:05,596 --> 02:47:05,916
So anyway.

1792
02:47:06,837 --> 02:47:06,917
Oh.

1793
02:47:08,577 --> 02:47:09,357
All right, everybody.

1794
02:47:09,377 --> 02:47:11,918
Email Tim, not me.

1795
02:47:12,098 --> 02:47:13,698
Email Tim, not me.

1796
02:47:17,277 --> 02:47:17,537
All right.

1797
02:47:18,918 --> 02:47:19,719
Councilor Callahan.

1798
02:47:21,961 --> 02:47:22,722
Thank you.

1799
02:47:22,902 --> 02:47:24,423
I also really appreciate this coming up.

1800
02:47:24,463 --> 02:47:30,448
I think this is a particularly great place or topic to have a public forum on.

1801
02:47:31,890 --> 02:47:39,957
I do think the technical term is that it is bonkers that we in Massachusetts allow there to be private ways that don't get city services.

1802
02:47:40,217 --> 02:47:41,278
You know it's one kind or another.

1803
02:47:41,298 --> 02:47:41,898
It seems crazy.

1804
02:47:44,460 --> 02:47:46,482
But it is what it is.

1805
02:47:46,502 --> 02:47:52,167
And I was going to offer a friendly amendment if that has not, I believe it has not been done yet.

1806
02:47:52,207 --> 02:48:11,003
So I was gonna offer a friendly amendment that in place of the final sentence paragraph there, that it would instead say, be it further resolved the city council draft an informational document for residents of Private Ways to inform them of what services they can expect from the city.

1807
02:48:12,475 --> 02:48:18,637
Could we friendly amend the friendly amendment to say that we will work with the city staff and communications department to draft?

1808
02:48:19,337 --> 02:48:19,557
Great.

1809
02:48:19,998 --> 02:48:20,298
Brilliant.

1810
02:48:20,538 --> 02:48:22,298
And if you could email that and counsel.

1811
02:48:22,378 --> 02:48:23,939
I apologize, I don't.

1812
02:48:23,959 --> 02:48:24,939
Could I just read it quick?

1813
02:48:25,059 --> 02:48:29,041
Can somebody, who types quick and has their computer?

1814
02:48:29,061 --> 02:48:31,121
Well, Rich will write it down maybe, or?

1815
02:48:31,742 --> 02:48:37,603
Yeah.

1816
02:48:38,084 --> 02:48:39,984
You can actually just cross out half of it.

1817
02:48:40,484 --> 02:48:41,585
It'll save you some.

1818
02:48:43,235 --> 02:48:43,715
I can give you this.

1819
02:48:43,775 --> 02:48:44,035
Yes.

1820
02:48:44,235 --> 02:48:44,715
Ah, perfect.

1821
02:48:44,735 --> 02:48:46,316
You will write it down and give it to Rich.

1822
02:48:46,416 --> 02:48:49,577
I wrote it down, but I don't know if you can read my handwriting.

1823
02:48:50,037 --> 02:48:52,858
And Matt, your amendment, could you do that same thing or email it?

1824
02:48:52,878 --> 02:48:55,019
You can just take a little photo of it.

1825
02:48:56,059 --> 02:48:59,300
What if we did four different ways and we are not sure if we end up getting it?

1826
02:48:59,780 --> 02:49:01,961
All right.

1827
02:49:02,001 --> 02:49:02,561
Thanks, Anna.

1828
02:49:02,921 --> 02:49:08,763
So we have a friendly amendment from Councilor Lemming, we have a friendly amendment from Councilor Callahan, and we're going to go to Councilor Sang.

1829
02:49:09,997 --> 02:49:11,619
I think clarity is good with this issue.

1830
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:15,302
I think it'd be helpful for us to build up something.

1831
02:49:15,642 --> 02:49:17,083
I'm just on the Boston website right now.

1832
02:49:17,143 --> 02:49:17,904
It's super clear.

1833
02:49:18,844 --> 02:49:23,288
So something like this I think would be really great to build out on the Medford website.

1834
02:49:24,209 --> 02:49:27,491
And then in preparing for this meeting, I think I was looking

1835
02:49:29,144 --> 02:49:44,855
Mass General Law, Chapter 40, Section 6N, which has some more information about what cities can do, what they can adopt, and a list of factors that we have to consider when it comes to private ways.

1836
02:49:44,935 --> 02:49:55,783
So when we talk about it more, I think that's just something to flag that we should, I think it would behoove all of us to take a look at that subsection and think about how that applies to our work.

1837
02:49:59,054 --> 02:49:59,314
Great.

1838
02:50:01,416 --> 02:50:05,338
Any further discussion by members of the council on Councillor Scarpelli?

1839
02:50:06,419 --> 02:50:16,546
If Tim, if you can, the 50% rule, if the resident, is it to pave the street or is it to petition to see if it could be turned into public?

1840
02:50:19,797 --> 02:50:30,281
So one of the ways that all of the, not all, a majority of the owners of the private way have to buy into the fact that it's going to become public because of the de facto owners.

1841
02:50:31,762 --> 02:50:35,843
Usually by another law that's called the derelict fee law.

1842
02:50:36,503 --> 02:50:38,804
They own to the center of the road basically, it's derelict.

1843
02:50:42,153 --> 02:50:46,657
Everybody has rights that live on the private way, that have frontage on the private way.

1844
02:50:47,097 --> 02:50:56,465
So you need some process to say the majority of those folks want the city to accept that as a public way.

1845
02:50:57,466 --> 02:51:04,632
I'm not sure if it's exactly 50-50 or what the law prescribes, but there is a strict process for that.

1846
02:51:04,832 --> 02:51:07,294
So the confusion wasn't just to just

1847
02:51:07,877 --> 02:51:09,518
The 50% just to pave, it's 50%.

1848
02:51:10,139 --> 02:51:17,123
We can do that if residents really feel like their streets are paved and they did everything right and then the engineer can go and approve it or not approve it.

1849
02:51:17,524 --> 02:51:18,204
It's still an option.

1850
02:51:18,504 --> 02:51:21,146
It's both because the other portion is the levy.

1851
02:51:21,466 --> 02:51:30,533
So it's basically giving permission for the city to give a tax to the frontage holders of the private way that will pay for the rebuilding of the street to city standards.

1852
02:51:30,933 --> 02:51:31,874
So you can't do that.

1853
02:51:33,135 --> 02:51:35,836
You can't, well, I think it's easier to do that

1854
02:51:37,037 --> 02:51:40,378
There's a vote by the people who actually own the private way.

1855
02:51:41,138 --> 02:51:44,659
Ultimately, the city can take a road in the interest of public interest.

1856
02:51:45,259 --> 02:51:46,640
That's the other way to do it.

1857
02:51:46,720 --> 02:51:56,602
For example, if the city felt there's a public interest to take a private way without getting that permission through eminent domain, that would be another option to move forward.

1858
02:51:57,562 --> 02:51:58,583
Yet another option would be

1859
02:51:59,960 --> 02:52:10,763
for the residents to all get together and start a company or an HOA, gather funds, make the improvements to the road, and then petition the city for acceptance.

1860
02:52:11,304 --> 02:52:17,886
Would, under an eminent domain situation, would the city have to compensate the property owners?

1861
02:52:18,266 --> 02:52:18,486
Yes.

1862
02:52:18,806 --> 02:52:21,687
To take the way, and we'd be taking it in a non

1863
02:52:22,832 --> 02:52:25,154
We'd then also have to pay to fix, to improve it.

1864
02:52:25,474 --> 02:52:25,814
Correct.

1865
02:52:25,895 --> 02:52:30,218
We'd have to use city funds to improve the road to city standards.

1866
02:52:30,598 --> 02:52:36,663
Those would be, those wouldn't be, well actually I shouldn't say, I think there's a couple of different ways you can do that.

1867
02:52:36,943 --> 02:52:39,105
And this is where kind of the legal process comes into play.

1868
02:52:39,826 --> 02:52:40,026
Great.

1869
02:52:40,186 --> 02:52:40,486
Thank you.

1870
02:52:40,626 --> 02:52:40,906
You're welcome.

1871
02:52:42,408 --> 02:52:46,311
Looks like we have two members of the public, maybe three, who'd like to speak on this issue.

1872
02:52:47,992 --> 02:52:49,754
So we'll go first to the podium and then we'll go to Zoom.

1873
02:52:49,774 --> 02:52:51,455
Name and address for the record please, and you have three minutes.

1874
02:52:53,408 --> 02:52:55,809
Simon Alcindor, 44 Tainter Street.

1875
02:52:56,510 --> 02:53:02,613
I just wanted to, again, thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up.

1876
02:53:03,673 --> 02:53:12,737
Even as a resident who lives on a public way, that has been something that has been just very confusing to figure out what that means.

1877
02:53:13,358 --> 02:53:16,699
And I do think that having resources like this is going to be really helpful.

1878
02:53:19,121 --> 02:53:27,766
And I think especially like the clarity around like how these things are designated would be very helpful because like there are definitely a lot of places where that has been unclear for a long time.

1879
02:53:27,806 --> 02:53:37,873
And I think that's these are the types of things that the city needs to be taking advantage of to be able to educate residents on how these things work especially these things that have been in place for a long time such as.

1880
02:53:38,393 --> 02:53:50,656
private ways, and also the other thing I want to point out is I think that this could be also a really good jumping off point to perhaps doing a little bit of haranguing of the state legislature to make some change on private ways.

1881
02:53:51,096 --> 02:54:05,560
I think this is something that isn't brought up very much, but this is something that can really be an issue, especially when it comes to private ways not being maintained in ways that are conducive to public use, especially when you have private ways, for example,

1882
02:54:06,620 --> 02:54:20,030
in the Lawrence Estates where there's a lot of private ways and a lot of people traverse those private ways en route to put in supplemental public ways and they're simply not built in a way that is safe for our residents.

1883
02:54:21,131 --> 02:54:28,276
So I think that this could be a really good jumping off point to further resolutions and whatnot.

1884
02:54:30,715 --> 02:54:36,880
encouraging our state delegation to look into further reform of private ways on the state level.

1885
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:38,281
Thank you.

1886
02:54:40,022 --> 02:54:40,762
Thanks, Simon.

1887
02:54:41,503 --> 02:54:44,665
We have Jen Sullivan on Zoom, then we'll come back to the chamber.

1888
02:54:44,725 --> 02:54:46,266
Jen, name and address for the record, please.

1889
02:54:46,286 --> 02:54:46,867
You have three minutes.

1890
02:54:50,982 --> 02:54:56,366
Hello, Jen Sullivan 35 Washington Street, I just wanted to thank you so much for bringing this up.

1891
02:54:57,086 --> 02:55:01,609
I am a new condo homeowner on a private way.

1892
02:55:02,230 --> 02:55:04,592
It's part of a part of two condo buildings.

1893
02:55:05,858 --> 02:55:07,980
As a glutton for punishment, I'm also now a trustee.

1894
02:55:10,042 --> 02:55:14,087
It's been very hard trying to educate myself on this.

1895
02:55:14,387 --> 02:55:24,357
Our building is a combination of old timers and a lot of newcomers, and we had a sudden massive pothole in front of an elderly woman's front door.

1896
02:55:25,098 --> 02:55:28,920
And just trying to find out how to address that quickly has been a challenge.

1897
02:55:30,320 --> 02:55:32,421
So again, I just really appreciate this.

1898
02:55:32,982 --> 02:55:37,164
It's helpful to have the information because I haven't even met all my neighbors yet.

1899
02:55:37,264 --> 02:55:40,085
So I would like to meet them and have information.

1900
02:55:40,405 --> 02:55:41,966
So just thanks again.

1901
02:55:41,986 --> 02:55:45,727
Thanks, Jen.

1902
02:55:45,767 --> 02:55:46,448
I appreciate it.

1903
02:55:48,969 --> 02:55:49,509
Oh, sorry.

1904
02:55:49,529 --> 02:55:51,110
I asked you to unmute, but don't do that.

1905
02:55:52,717 --> 02:55:55,018
Go to the podium, name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.

1906
02:55:56,518 --> 02:55:58,039
Nick Giulio, Forty Robinson Road.

1907
02:55:59,039 --> 02:56:09,262
So I know we're watering down the resolution just a little bit, given concerns about, you know, can we actually legally draft an ordinance, you know, addressing this subject.

1908
02:56:09,282 --> 02:56:11,943
But I would just caution you not to close the door on that.

1909
02:56:12,443 --> 02:56:13,024
right away.

1910
02:56:14,084 --> 02:56:19,448
I do personally think that the city does have legal power to draft such an ordinance.

1911
02:56:20,389 --> 02:56:24,612
I liked Councillor Lemming's idea of getting a legal opinion on what the city can do.

1912
02:56:24,672 --> 02:56:31,957
I think that's something that probably would be a good starting point in terms of can we actually draft an ordinance here about private ways.

1913
02:56:32,177 --> 02:56:39,683
Another thing I was doing before this meeting was just researching, you know, in our code of ordinances, you know, do we actually have anything currently on

1914
02:56:40,265 --> 02:56:42,209
private ways, and I did actually find something.

1915
02:56:42,229 --> 02:56:49,403
I just had spoken, not in front of the podium with Commissioner McGivern about it, but there's a section, it's Chapter 70,

1916
02:56:51,840 --> 02:56:55,804
Section 91, it's called Temporary Repairs of Private Ways.

1917
02:56:55,844 --> 02:56:57,586
I'd encourage you all to take a look at that.

1918
02:56:58,187 --> 02:57:06,215
It says that a city may make temporary repairs on private ways provided that a private way has been open for public use for a term of five years or more.

1919
02:57:06,976 --> 02:57:13,242
Fifty-one percent of the abutters who live along such way shall petition the mayor for temporary repairs of such way.

1920
02:57:14,163 --> 02:57:14,824
And it goes on.

1921
02:57:15,280 --> 02:57:23,965
And it says that the city may perform such temporary repairs on private ways as determined by the mayor based on recommendations from the director of public works and the city engineer.

1922
02:57:24,665 --> 02:57:26,747
So it looks like we do have a little something.

1923
02:57:26,867 --> 02:57:28,168
I mean, that was really all I could find.

1924
02:57:28,188 --> 02:57:31,790
But it looks like we do have a little something on private ways currently on the books.

1925
02:57:32,150 --> 02:57:39,354
So for me, that suggests that, you know, there could be potential here in drafting a more comprehensive ordinance on private ways.

1926
02:57:40,094 --> 02:57:41,495
I've dealt personally with

1927
02:57:43,178 --> 02:57:47,180
the law of what is a public versus private way in my professional life.

1928
02:57:47,220 --> 02:57:48,600
And I'll tell you, it is confusing.

1929
02:57:49,060 --> 02:57:49,720
It is archaic.

1930
02:57:50,441 --> 02:57:59,944
I do believe the municipalities have power to address this subject just given how fundamental it is to cities and towns and what they do.

1931
02:58:00,705 --> 02:58:04,346
And just another thing, I think if we eventually do get to a point of drafting a comprehensive

1932
02:58:05,678 --> 02:58:11,640
I just encourage some sort of like prioritization of safety concerns on private ways.

1933
02:58:12,820 --> 02:58:22,762
I talked to one resident who was very worried about an old tree, a branch on this old tree on the street falling where a school bus picks up kids, you know.

1934
02:58:22,802 --> 02:58:29,964
And he was saying, you know, I've been asking for this branch to be cut down for so long and just, you know, it doesn't seem like it's being prioritized.

1935
02:58:30,024 --> 02:58:33,185
And in his own words, he said, you know, this is an accident waiting to happen.

1936
02:58:34,315 --> 02:58:39,279
So, you know, I think in terms of liability, too, you know, it's something we want to take a look at because it is concerning.

1937
02:58:39,679 --> 02:58:49,386
You know, I think there's potential for a lawsuit if, you know, somebody gets injured on a private way due to perhaps DPW work not getting there in time.

1938
02:58:49,546 --> 02:58:56,251
So I think there are really tons and tons of benefits here of some sort of ordinance on private ways.

1939
02:58:57,412 --> 02:58:59,514
So hopefully we can kind of keep that discussion going.

1940
02:59:00,415 --> 02:59:03,481
But of course, the forum ideas is a good starting point as well.

1941
02:59:03,801 --> 02:59:04,102
Thank you.

1942
02:59:05,003 --> 02:59:05,424
Thank you, Nick.

1943
02:59:07,267 --> 02:59:07,668
Test on.

1944
02:59:09,051 --> 02:59:09,191
Great.

1945
02:59:10,546 --> 02:59:13,449
Name and address for record, you have three minutes.

1946
02:59:14,069 --> 02:59:15,030
So I live in a private way.

1947
02:59:16,011 --> 02:59:20,935
So last time I looked at this, around 40% of our roads are private ways.

1948
02:59:21,515 --> 02:59:25,639
I don't know lengthwise what the percentage is, but that's just by the number of roads.

1949
02:59:26,520 --> 02:59:29,963
And a couple of years ago, I actually had to go through this myself.

1950
02:59:31,124 --> 02:59:35,307
There's a section of our private way that is in kind of not that good of a condition.

1951
02:59:36,887 --> 02:59:40,168
I called, I think it was EPW originally, to try to pave it.

1952
02:59:40,748 --> 02:59:42,188
And they told me, well, you're in a private way.

1953
02:59:42,308 --> 02:59:43,168
We can just patch it.

1954
02:59:44,508 --> 02:59:48,109
So I think that's the main problem here is that people have no idea about this.

1955
02:59:48,129 --> 02:59:49,629
And then I talked to engineering.

1956
02:59:49,669 --> 02:59:51,110
Engineering was super helpful.

1957
02:59:51,730 --> 02:59:56,330
And they gave advice and talked to your neighbors, et cetera.

1958
02:59:56,370 --> 03:00:00,671
And then they would sort of come take a look and advice on how to proceed.

1959
03:00:00,751 --> 03:00:03,572
So I think if the city can provide that kind of support,

1960
03:00:05,873 --> 03:00:06,494
It would be great.

1961
03:00:07,695 --> 03:00:12,700
And I just think it's not feasible to convert this into public roads.

1962
03:00:12,800 --> 03:00:20,847
My understanding is that, for example, in the one that I have, there's not enough space for two sidewalks on both sides, et cetera.

1963
03:00:21,828 --> 03:00:40,230
So I think it's more of a matter of helping residents, first of all, understand that they're in a private way, they have no idea, and second, once, for example, the resident I mentioned, there's a huge pothole in front of a resident, so they don't feel helpless, and someone from the city tells them, like, you should contact this company, you have to pay for it, but then they'll come and fix it.

1964
03:00:43,973 --> 03:00:51,659
Lastly, I think we need to pay a lot of attention when we discuss zoning again on private ways, because parking is a huge issue.

1965
03:00:52,660 --> 03:00:55,602
Parking enforcement on private ways is very tricky.

1966
03:00:56,103 --> 03:01:02,088
You can't just call a towing company to tow a car that is parked in front of your driveway, for example, on a private way.

1967
03:01:02,808 --> 03:01:13,751
So as we discussed, for example, parking minimums and things like that, we need to be very, very careful that we don't get a lot of overflow on private ways, that emergency vehicles can still access private ways and things like that.

1968
03:01:14,971 --> 03:01:19,113
Ines Associates said that that was one of the main reasons why they decided to not

1969
03:01:20,793 --> 03:01:23,816
push the density on certain areas of the city.

1970
03:01:24,356 --> 03:01:36,428
So I just think that as long as we are aware that about 40% of our roads are private ways, that we help residents when they deal with problems about how to navigate that complexity, I think we'll be fine.

1971
03:01:36,528 --> 03:01:40,552
And I mean, I probably don't want my private way converted into public way.

1972
03:01:40,772 --> 03:01:44,796
So also, I don't want the government to come and take my private way.

1973
03:01:46,968 --> 03:01:51,929
people need help, but other than that, then I think, you know, things should work fine.

1974
03:01:52,209 --> 03:01:57,111
And thank you to engineering, they were super helpful, so when you reach them out, so thanks a lot.

1975
03:01:57,951 --> 03:01:58,551
Awesome, thank you.

1976
03:02:02,652 --> 03:02:03,673
You and me, Tim, you and me.

1977
03:02:08,714 --> 03:02:10,655
Yeah, I really want to talk about private ways all the time.

1978
03:02:15,145 --> 03:02:15,465
All right.

1979
03:02:16,186 --> 03:02:28,511
On the motion of Councillor Scarpelli as amended by Councillor Lemming and Councillor Callaghan seconded by Councillor Mullane.

1980
03:02:28,531 --> 03:02:30,412
Wow.

1981
03:02:31,773 --> 03:02:32,593
There we go.

1982
03:02:33,393 --> 03:02:34,814
Finally got a chance to say it.

1983
03:02:36,635 --> 03:02:37,555
All those in favor.

1984
03:02:38,696 --> 03:02:39,356
Opposed.

1985
03:02:39,976 --> 03:02:40,917
Motion passes.

1986
03:02:42,538 --> 03:02:46,202
All right, communications from the mayor.

1987
03:02:46,222 --> 03:02:46,242
26-012.

1988
03:02:47,163 --> 03:02:48,965
Proposed, submitted by Mayor Brianne O'Kern.

1989
03:02:49,045 --> 03:02:53,470
Proposed wage adjustment for DPW superintendents, building department inspectors, recreation union.

1990
03:02:55,187 --> 03:03:04,511
Dear President Behrs and City Councilors, respectfully request and recommend City Council approve the following amendments for revised ordinances, Chapter 66, Article 2, be it ordained by the City Council of the City of Medford.

1991
03:03:05,791 --> 03:03:18,377
In Article 2 entitled reserve the city's classification compensation plan, formally included as Article 2, Section 66-31 to 66-40, amend the figures as they presently appear next to the following title by adjusting each to reflect the following percentage wage increase.

1992
03:03:19,277 --> 03:03:20,677
This is effective July 1, 22.

1993
03:03:22,398 --> 03:03:24,240
Base salary increased 2.5 percent.

1994
03:03:24,300 --> 03:03:25,342
July 1, 2023, base salary increased 2.5 percent.

1995
03:03:25,362 --> 03:03:26,583
July 1, 2024, base salary increased 3 percent.

1996

1997
03:03:27,764 --> 03:03:28,645
July 1, 2026, base salary increased 2.5 percent.

1998
03:03:28,685 --> 03:03:29,847
July 1, 2027, base salary increased 2.5 percent.

1999
03:03:29,867 --> 03:03:32,509
HR Director Lisa Crowley will be able to answer any questions.

2000
03:03:44,102 --> 03:03:47,585
And I'm pretty sure this probably just says on the back, thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

2001
03:03:47,625 --> 03:03:49,907
Respectfully submitted, Brianne Lingo-Kern, Mayor.

2002
03:03:51,348 --> 03:03:57,994
We have, so this is for our union contract for our DPW superintendents, building department inspectors, and recreation union.

2003
03:03:58,214 --> 03:03:59,976
And I'll recognize Councillor Scarpelli.

2004
03:04:00,516 --> 03:04:01,837
Thank you, Mr. Baez.

2005
03:04:03,177 --> 03:04:06,058
This is something that's been longing for.

2006
03:04:06,178 --> 03:04:07,278
I think that it's about time.

2007
03:04:07,298 --> 03:04:09,479
I appreciate all the work to get this done.

2008
03:04:10,039 --> 03:04:12,800
I would also make the motion to waive the three readings.

2009
03:04:12,860 --> 03:04:18,402
I think that city employees have gone through this process long enough to wait for the three readings will be

2010
03:04:19,142 --> 03:04:22,424
a bigger hardship that they've already had to go through.

2011
03:04:22,484 --> 03:04:30,729
So I would move approval and ask that we motion to waive three readings to move this along quicker.

2012
03:04:31,150 --> 03:04:37,393
On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli to waive the three readings and approve to be ordained, seconded by Councilor Sang.

2013
03:04:37,413 --> 03:04:40,375
Any further discussion by members of the council?

2014
03:04:43,057 --> 03:04:46,259
Seeing none, any discussion by members of the public either in person or on Zoom?

2015
03:04:48,775 --> 03:04:51,016
Seeing none, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2016
03:04:52,958 --> 03:04:53,718
Councillor Callaghan.

2017
03:04:53,738 --> 03:04:53,798
Yes.

2018
03:04:55,459 --> 03:04:56,560
Vice President Lazzaro.

2019
03:04:56,920 --> 03:04:57,120
Yes.

2020
03:04:58,861 --> 03:04:59,482
Councillor Lemy.

2021
03:04:59,502 --> 03:04:59,602
Yes.

2022
03:05:01,483 --> 03:05:02,424
Councillor Scarpelli.

2023
03:05:02,744 --> 03:05:03,024
Yes.

2024
03:05:03,704 --> 03:05:04,445
Councillor Singh.

2025
03:05:04,665 --> 03:05:04,865
Yes.

2026
03:05:06,806 --> 03:05:07,447
Councillor Malay.

2027
03:05:07,467 --> 03:05:07,547
Yes.

2028
03:05:09,367 --> 03:05:10,047
President Beers.

2029
03:05:10,247 --> 03:05:14,650
Yes, I'm in the affirmative down the negative, the motion passes.

2030
03:05:14,930 --> 03:05:22,814
26013 submitted by Mayor Brannon-McCurran, capital stabilization fund and water and sewer capital stabilization appropriation requests, DPW vehicle and water main replacements.

2031
03:05:23,434 --> 03:05:32,659
Dear President Beers and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve appropriations from the capital stabilization fund in the amount of $37,223.00 for a hybrid SUV DPW admin vehicle.

2032
03:05:37,461 --> 03:05:41,584
The balance of the Capital Stabilization Fund before this vote is $10,568,569.

2033
03:05:41,984 --> 03:06:00,795
Two, Water and Sewer Capital Stabilization Fund in the amount of $325,000.00 to supplement design and or construction funding for water remain placement projects including, but not limited to, Capon Street, Grove Street, Bustle Road, Century Street, Extension, Playstead Road, Woods Road, Roberts Road, Kilgore Avenue, Monument Street, and Sharon Street.

2034
03:06:01,240 --> 03:06:04,363
The balance of the water and sewer capital stabilization fund before this vote is $1,765,000.

2035
03:06:06,125 --> 03:06:11,351
DPW Commissioner Tim McGivern and City Engineer Owen Wartella will be available to answer questions.

2036
03:06:11,411 --> 03:06:13,213
Respectfully submitted, Brianna Leocurin, Mayor.

2037
03:06:13,353 --> 03:06:16,337
Tim and Owen, tell us what it's about.

2038
03:06:18,658 --> 03:06:19,879
Thank you, President Behrs.

2039
03:06:20,339 --> 03:06:22,480
And I should say, welcome, Councilwoman Mullane.

2040
03:06:22,821 --> 03:06:23,881
I'm sorry I didn't say that before.

2041
03:06:24,301 --> 03:06:24,602
Welcome.

2042
03:06:25,182 --> 03:06:30,645
So anyway, I'll go first, then Owen can talk to you about the water project.

2043
03:06:30,966 --> 03:06:31,726
Pretty straightforward.

2044
03:06:32,126 --> 03:06:34,127
We need a new administration vehicle.

2045
03:06:34,628 --> 03:06:37,970
Right now, the deputy commissioner is borrowing a vehicle from engineering.

2046
03:06:38,370 --> 03:06:39,470
Engineering really wants it back.

2047
03:06:39,971 --> 03:06:44,712
And this is actually an identified expense from our 2025 CIP.

2048
03:06:44,732 --> 03:06:47,393
So it's actually the last purchase of our CIP.

2049
03:06:48,253 --> 03:06:54,776
This vehicle would go to Commissioner and then my vehicle and then my vehicle would go to Deputy Commissioner.

2050
03:06:55,916 --> 03:06:57,236
So hopefully that explains it.

2051
03:06:58,477 --> 03:06:59,237
Happy to answer questions.

2052
03:06:59,797 --> 03:07:00,057
Great.

2053
03:07:00,377 --> 03:07:02,258
Any questions about the DPW vehicle?

2054
03:07:05,979 --> 03:07:06,840
Are you happy with this, Owen?

2055
03:07:08,112 --> 03:07:09,193
Owen, you good with this?

2056
03:07:09,313 --> 03:07:10,234
I'm happy with it.

2057
03:07:10,254 --> 03:07:10,514
Great.

2058
03:07:10,794 --> 03:07:11,174
Fantastic.

2059
03:07:11,194 --> 03:07:12,255
I really need that truck back.

2060
03:07:14,737 --> 03:07:15,597
Just making sure.

2061
03:07:17,158 --> 03:07:20,661
You want to talk about the design and or construction water main project?

2062
03:07:20,781 --> 03:07:21,101
Sure.

2063
03:07:21,321 --> 03:07:22,782
This is basically an ongoing

2064
03:07:24,765 --> 03:07:31,310
We have a 15-year plan of replacing 70 miles worth of water mains in the city.

2065
03:07:32,110 --> 03:07:33,131
We have a five-year plan.

2066
03:07:33,191 --> 03:07:38,534
This is the design for the end of year one and year two.

2067
03:07:39,235 --> 03:07:40,375
It's not construction cost.

2068
03:07:40,436 --> 03:07:41,636
It's only for design only.

2069
03:07:44,950 --> 03:07:50,652
For those roadways, the water mains going from a 6 inch to an 8 inch, mostly.

2070
03:07:51,072 --> 03:07:52,913
In some cases, it's going to a 12 inch.

2071
03:07:54,053 --> 03:08:00,195
We're focusing on low pressure, high flows, and high lead line areas.

2072
03:08:00,875 --> 03:08:06,797
And in these areas, we predict that there's about 275 lead lines.

2073
03:08:06,817 --> 03:08:08,298
I'm hoping for a question.

2074
03:08:18,295 --> 03:08:18,455
No.

2075
03:08:18,635 --> 03:08:19,575
I don't get the first question.

2076
03:08:19,595 --> 03:08:21,416
I was hoping.

2077
03:08:22,176 --> 03:08:22,356
Nope.

2078
03:08:22,857 --> 03:08:23,677
Not from Liz today.

2079
03:08:23,697 --> 03:08:24,337
You get Anna though.

2080
03:08:24,357 --> 03:08:25,077
All right.

2081
03:08:26,158 --> 03:08:28,398
While I don't have a question, I'm thrilled.

2082
03:08:28,518 --> 03:08:33,860
I'm thrilled that we are, you know, taking care of the lead lines in the city.

2083
03:08:33,900 --> 03:08:34,440
I think that's.

2084
03:08:34,460 --> 03:08:41,783
Well, I'll be back soon to, once the capitalization funds get finalized, I'll be back to ask for construction money.

2085
03:08:42,143 --> 03:08:42,443
Thank you.

2086
03:08:42,823 --> 03:08:42,983
Great.

2087
03:08:46,985 --> 03:08:53,135
It's funny because for some reason Shane put Councillor Maloney into the system as Liz with two Z's.

2088
03:08:54,278 --> 03:09:00,600
So I just see, I just see, I see number four Liz has come up to ask a question.

2089
03:09:00,680 --> 03:09:01,900
So Councilor Malauulu.

2090
03:09:02,140 --> 03:09:02,620
Thank you.

2091
03:09:02,681 --> 03:09:04,601
Just a real quick, just a real quick question.

2092
03:09:05,161 --> 03:09:11,303
In terms of the project plan, like how long is this going to take or how long do you think this portion of it will be?

2093
03:09:12,103 --> 03:09:13,964
This is just years finishing up.

2094
03:09:14,484 --> 03:09:17,665
So we're technically in year one or starting year one.

2095
03:09:18,525 --> 03:09:23,408
We got a little bit of a head start last year with one of the projects Arlington Street.

2096
03:09:23,668 --> 03:09:26,729
It is 90 percent complete.

2097
03:09:26,789 --> 03:09:27,230
We still have.

2098
03:09:28,170 --> 03:09:28,991
We ran out of time.

2099
03:09:29,271 --> 03:09:30,311
It was temperature wise.

2100
03:09:30,471 --> 03:09:30,691
Sure.

2101
03:09:30,892 --> 03:09:37,695
So they will come in the spring for another three or four weeks and then there's two more projects on year one.

2102
03:09:38,575 --> 03:09:39,136
But we're.

2103
03:09:39,976 --> 03:09:50,163
trying to queue up year two, which will be the following year, for the design, so that once this time of year, next year, we can hit the ground running and keep going.

2104
03:09:50,924 --> 03:09:55,507
But we have a five-year plan, and, you know, it's evolving.

2105
03:09:55,527 --> 03:09:57,989
It does change from, you know, time to time.

2106
03:09:58,049 --> 03:09:58,669
But, yeah.

2107
03:10:03,935 --> 03:10:09,376
Roughly it's more than two it's about seven million dollars worth of water main work.

2108
03:10:09,917 --> 03:10:13,678
At least that's the idea pending on funding.

2109
03:10:13,978 --> 03:10:17,379
So but we're getting really good at getting the water rates up.

2110
03:10:17,659 --> 03:10:19,239
So we should have the funds for this.

2111
03:10:19,779 --> 03:10:19,959
Great.

2112
03:10:20,019 --> 03:10:26,241
Thank you.

2113
03:10:26,661 --> 03:10:28,502
There is a road in that neighborhood.

2114
03:10:30,882 --> 03:10:35,025
That is in terrible terrible disrepair and I can't remember which one it is.

2115
03:10:35,145 --> 03:10:42,090
Century Street extension maybe is the beginning of it and then how it curves along the edge of the private way.

2116
03:10:42,190 --> 03:10:42,450
Yes.

2117
03:10:42,470 --> 03:10:44,092
So Bustle maybe is it.

2118
03:10:44,292 --> 03:10:53,959
It is a private way I know it is because I drive on it a lot when I try to avoid driving on High Street because the train goes there and blocks you.

2119
03:10:54,279 --> 03:10:55,059
Yeah.

2120
03:10:55,960 --> 03:10:59,083
But when you drive on it, it's just lousy with potholes.

2121
03:11:00,164 --> 03:11:07,852
So I'm wondering if you're going to do the water main on that street or did you already say that last night?

2122
03:11:08,412 --> 03:11:10,734
So this is just for the water main replacement.

2123
03:11:10,835 --> 03:11:11,635
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2124
03:11:11,896 --> 03:11:12,977
So but when you do that.

2125
03:11:13,943 --> 03:11:20,510
Is it the connecting part, so it's just the entrance to the house, or is it the underneath everything?

2126
03:11:21,311 --> 03:11:22,492
Big pipes.

2127
03:11:22,712 --> 03:11:24,514
We're doing big pipes or we're doing little pipes?

2128
03:11:24,554 --> 03:11:25,094
Big pipes.

2129
03:11:25,535 --> 03:11:29,919
Yeah, so I'm thinking if you have to get under there, maybe you fix those roads.

2130
03:11:29,939 --> 03:11:30,019
So...

2131
03:11:36,462 --> 03:11:37,665
That road is so bad.

2132
03:11:37,685 --> 03:11:45,685
The plan is that we as we're moving forward we are going to be going through and repairing the roads the following year.

2133
03:11:47,872 --> 03:11:52,973
Even the private ways.

2134
03:11:53,173 --> 03:11:58,155
The intent is to come through like I know for as I can speak on what's queued up this year.

2135
03:11:58,655 --> 03:12:01,735
Willis and Arlington Street we have chapter 90 funding for that.

2136
03:12:02,236 --> 03:12:10,758
And our intent is to pave those roads redo the sidewalks and curbing so that they are city standard for the runs.

2137
03:12:12,558 --> 03:12:14,639
That's the plan for it.

2138
03:12:14,919 --> 03:12:18,401
So I can't those residents are going to have to deal with those.

2139
03:12:18,481 --> 03:12:20,321
I can't speak for something for two or three years out.

2140
03:12:20,902 --> 03:12:21,582
Oh yeah yeah sure.

2141
03:12:21,602 --> 03:12:31,446
But I mean the intent is at the time to pave the road to a temporary pavement and then the following year come through and redo the roads.

2142
03:12:35,945 --> 03:12:38,007
Chapter 90 money can't be spent on private ways.

2143
03:12:38,808 --> 03:12:47,819
So that's one of the reasons why we don't, well, it all has to do with that state law network of laws that define what we can spend money on.

2144
03:12:48,780 --> 03:12:54,426
So we have an obligation in private ways to put the street back to the way it was or better.

2145
03:12:55,287 --> 03:12:56,328
Oh, but better, or better.

2146
03:12:56,628 --> 03:12:58,729
I was going to say, just put the potholes back in.

2147
03:12:59,250 --> 03:12:59,730
Exactly.

2148
03:12:59,750 --> 03:13:03,733
We have an obligation to match the pothole, divot for divot.

2149
03:13:03,773 --> 03:13:09,236
We're going to do a 3D scan of the road beforehand.

2150
03:13:09,276 --> 03:13:16,241
Everybody's seen it all over town, these swaths of pavements that are about 8 to 12 feet wide that go down the length of the street.

2151
03:13:16,681 --> 03:13:17,782
OK.

2152
03:13:17,962 --> 03:13:18,562
That's what it'll be.

2153
03:13:18,662 --> 03:13:18,882
OK.

2154
03:13:19,043 --> 03:13:19,303
Got it.

2155
03:13:19,483 --> 03:13:19,843
Thank you.

2156
03:13:22,125 --> 03:13:22,725
Councilor Callahan.

2157
03:13:25,058 --> 03:13:41,667
On that note, would it make any sense at all to reach out to the residents of Private Ways as you're doing this kind of work and ask if, would it be a time when it would be cheaper for them to have the other half of the road paved?

2158
03:13:42,087 --> 03:13:43,147
Would there be any possibility?

2159
03:13:43,187 --> 03:13:44,028
Or is that too complicated?

2160
03:13:45,096 --> 03:13:46,057
It's not too complicated.

2161
03:13:46,077 --> 03:13:48,838
A lot of private ways do that already.

2162
03:13:49,138 --> 03:13:51,520
So it's encouraged.

2163
03:13:51,920 --> 03:14:05,788
And if it's if I know when the gas company comes through and they're only responsible for repairing their trench a few private ways this past year got them to do the whole roadway because they pitched in extra money.

2164
03:14:05,968 --> 03:14:06,348
Amazing.

2165
03:14:06,528 --> 03:14:06,889
Thank you.

2166
03:14:07,569 --> 03:14:07,989
Glad to hear it.

2167
03:14:09,030 --> 03:14:09,230
Great.

2168
03:14:10,367 --> 03:14:11,849
on the motion to approve.

2169
03:14:11,929 --> 03:14:12,890
Oh, we got one question.

2170
03:14:12,910 --> 03:14:14,191
We got a question here on Zoom.

2171
03:14:15,632 --> 03:14:17,815
Well, any more questions from members of the council?

2172
03:14:18,976 --> 03:14:19,997
Just a comment.

2173
03:14:20,017 --> 03:14:20,738
Councilor Scarpelli.

2174
03:14:21,719 --> 03:14:28,766
I'm so happy to see the paving, the crew working with the new street paver.

2175
03:14:30,708 --> 03:14:33,930
It's pretty impressive, so I think that I just want to give you kudos.

2176
03:14:33,990 --> 03:14:39,353
I know that it took some time to get going, and I know I was the one that's always saying, you know, where is this crew?

2177
03:14:39,914 --> 03:14:46,758
But I just wanted to make sure I give you the same respect in that context, that you could see they're loving it.

2178
03:14:47,298 --> 03:14:50,020
You know, they're really enjoying doing it, and the neighbors are.

2179
03:14:50,280 --> 03:14:55,803
I mean, maybe they're lying to us, but the neighbors love seeing our city workers doing that job, so.

2180
03:14:56,583 --> 03:14:57,024
I'm with you.

2181
03:14:57,044 --> 03:15:02,528
I think it's fantastic and we're at that point where this year we got a lot of good practice in.

2182
03:15:02,628 --> 03:15:06,951
We did some areas where we've been dumping pothole money into for a long time.

2183
03:15:07,752 --> 03:15:11,415
And we got a pretty good idea of what things are going to look like next year.

2184
03:15:11,435 --> 03:15:12,676
So we're looking forward to that.

2185
03:15:13,176 --> 03:15:13,856
So thank you.

2186
03:15:16,639 --> 03:15:17,339
Fantastic.

2187
03:15:17,940 --> 03:15:22,723
Seeing no more questions from the council, we'll go to public participation either in person or on Zoom.

2188
03:15:23,244 --> 03:15:25,746
You can come to the podium in person or raise your hand on Zoom.

2189
03:15:27,260 --> 03:15:30,361
Seeing no one in person, I will go to Sue Edelman.

2190
03:15:30,481 --> 03:15:32,001
Sue, name it on Zoom.

2191
03:15:32,181 --> 03:15:33,402
Sue, name and address for the record, please.

2192
03:15:33,422 --> 03:15:34,202
And you have three minutes.

2193
03:15:35,322 --> 03:15:36,483
Yeah, Sue Edelman.

2194
03:15:36,603 --> 03:15:41,604
I live on 7 Bustle Road, the notorious street that you were just talking about.

2195
03:15:43,325 --> 03:15:43,925
Can you guys hear me?

2196
03:15:45,155 --> 03:15:45,995
Yes, Sue, we can hear you.

2197
03:15:46,015 --> 03:15:46,396
Okay, great.

2198
03:15:46,456 --> 03:15:49,537
So I'm glad that you talked about Bustle Road.

2199
03:15:50,237 --> 03:16:13,749
Zach, I've talked to you about this before, but I'm very interested to know when they do the water pipes, if they'll be able to improve the street, knowing that this is a street that everyone uses to cut through, and also that Keolis uses to access the commuter rail, and their trucks are a major factor in why this street gets torn up.

2200
03:16:15,049 --> 03:16:20,151
because they're constantly driving on the edge of the road and breaking up the edges of the road, which then goes towards the middle.

2201
03:16:20,671 --> 03:16:30,915
So I'm just weighing in that Bustle Road does need some help and whatever we can do to make it better and take advantage of what's going to happen with the water.

2202
03:16:32,395 --> 03:16:33,656
I'm interested in hearing about it.

2203
03:16:36,894 --> 03:16:37,515
Thank you, Sue.

2204
03:16:37,995 --> 03:16:38,996
And I'm going to go to our engineer.

2205
03:16:39,796 --> 03:16:44,540
I would like to say one thing here, because Councilor Scarpelli mentioned it earlier.

2206
03:16:45,841 --> 03:16:51,546
Whenever we approve a traffic management plan, it's never down a private way.

2207
03:16:51,966 --> 03:16:54,628
It's never through another city.

2208
03:16:54,668 --> 03:16:56,390
It's never through on a private way.

2209
03:16:56,870 --> 03:17:02,054
So if you see trucks going down private ways that are tearing it up, call us up.

2210
03:17:02,315 --> 03:17:04,957
We'll hunt them down and let them know that they shouldn't be doing that.

2211
03:17:05,177 --> 03:17:05,377
OK?

2212
03:17:06,338 --> 03:17:06,518
Yeah.

2213
03:17:09,857 --> 03:17:13,318
I will know I get calls every day about that.

2214
03:17:13,398 --> 03:17:20,060
And so I'm it's it's frustrating because a lot of time goes into a traffic management plan and like just follow the plan.

2215
03:17:20,861 --> 03:17:23,081
And yeah it happens all the time.

2216
03:17:23,201 --> 03:17:24,282
So just call us up.

2217
03:17:24,302 --> 03:17:27,923
We'll hunt them down and we usually have a permit for them to do.

2218
03:17:30,224 --> 03:17:30,504
Awesome.

2219
03:17:31,924 --> 03:17:34,325
Any more participation on this paper.

2220
03:17:35,745 --> 03:17:37,826
Seeing none on the motion of.

2221
03:17:40,073 --> 03:17:41,614
Someone to approve, anyone?

2222
03:17:41,714 --> 03:17:42,075
I so move.

2223
03:17:44,217 --> 03:17:47,179
Vice President Lazaro, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

2224
03:17:47,960 --> 03:17:49,001
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2225
03:17:52,504 --> 03:17:53,204
Councilor Kelly?

2226
03:17:53,224 --> 03:17:53,304
Yes.

2227
03:17:56,107 --> 03:17:57,107
Vice President Lazaro?

2228
03:17:57,127 --> 03:17:57,187
Yes.

2229
03:17:58,969 --> 03:17:59,609
Councilor Lemming?

2230
03:17:59,629 --> 03:17:59,690
Yes.

2231
03:18:01,091 --> 03:18:02,011
Councilor Scarpelli?

2232
03:18:02,132 --> 03:18:02,272
Yes.

2233
03:18:03,172 --> 03:18:03,773
Councilor Singh?

2234
03:18:03,813 --> 03:18:03,873
Yes.

2235
03:18:05,494 --> 03:18:06,115
Councilor Mullain?

2236
03:18:06,135 --> 03:18:06,195
Yes.

2237
03:18:07,816 --> 03:18:08,377
President Bierce?

2238
03:18:08,782 --> 03:18:10,002
Yes, 70 affirmative, none negative.

2239
03:18:10,022 --> 03:18:10,763
The motion passes.

2240
03:18:10,783 --> 03:18:11,183
Thank you.

2241
03:18:12,463 --> 03:18:16,484
Public participation, we have Robin Dooling, 74 Hume Ave, Medford.

2242
03:18:16,664 --> 03:18:18,925
Would like to speak about the permit parking in the GLX zone.

2243
03:18:18,965 --> 03:18:20,425
The fee for my family is ridiculous.

2244
03:18:20,505 --> 03:18:21,866
Permit parking was forced on us.

2245
03:18:22,006 --> 03:18:26,907
Plenty of people can park freely in front of their homes, not opposed to permit but opposed to paying.

2246
03:18:27,227 --> 03:18:27,967
Hi, how are you?

2247
03:18:27,987 --> 03:18:28,448
Robin, how are you?

2248
03:18:28,488 --> 03:18:29,148
Name and address.

2249
03:18:29,168 --> 03:18:31,268
Thanks for letting me be here tonight.

2250
03:18:31,328 --> 03:18:33,469
Robin Dooling, I'm at 74 Hume Ave.

2251
03:18:34,749 --> 03:18:36,890
I'm on the corner lot of Hume and Sunset.

2252
03:18:38,860 --> 03:18:44,184
I've lived here in Medford my entire life, and I currently live on Umav, corner of Sunset, what I just stated.

2253
03:18:44,745 --> 03:18:56,334
In July of 2024, the Green Line extension came into Medford, and as a result, those of us who live within the quarter mile radius were forced into the GLX zone.

2254
03:18:57,174 --> 03:19:03,659
While I understand the need for the zone, the piece I can't seem to wrap my head around is the paying to park in front of my own home.

2255
03:19:04,800 --> 03:19:09,207
I live in a street that did not have permit parking prior to the GLX zoning.

2256
03:19:10,048 --> 03:19:15,436
And now that permit parking was forced on us, we find ourselves now having to pay to park in front of our own homes.

2257
03:19:16,898 --> 03:19:18,380
For me, it's really about the principle.

2258
03:19:19,722 --> 03:19:24,225
I have friends and family throughout this city that do not have to pay to park where they live.

2259
03:19:24,785 --> 03:19:27,166
They pay the same property tax rate as my family.

2260
03:19:28,347 --> 03:19:33,550
I understand the need for the permit, but I totally disagree that I should pay to park in front of my own home.

2261
03:19:34,471 --> 03:19:43,055
I am happy to go through the process to obtain the permit, but feel very strongly that we should not pay for something that was forced on us because of where we live.

2262
03:19:44,356 --> 03:19:49,579
I won't even mention the fact that the fees increased this year substantially on a percentage basis from last year.

2263
03:19:50,560 --> 03:19:59,365
So to summarize, I think you all know where I'm going with this, I feel very strongly that we should not be financially penalized compared to other residents in the city because of where we live.

2264
03:20:00,946 --> 03:20:01,266
Thank you.

2265
03:20:03,287 --> 03:20:03,848
Thank you, Robin.

2266
03:20:03,868 --> 03:20:05,189
So what do I do from here?

2267
03:20:07,712 --> 03:20:14,257
Well, I wish that everyone who spoke was as concise and clear with their points as you were.

2268
03:20:15,438 --> 03:20:17,119
You know, we've had a few five minutes.

2269
03:20:17,219 --> 03:20:20,562
This has been three years in the making, I've wanted to come up here and talk about this issue.

2270
03:20:21,302 --> 03:20:34,572
And it's not just me, my community members, my neighbors, they're all like, we didn't have parking to begin with, we didn't have permit parking to begin with, now all of a sudden, this was thrown on us without, I woke up one morning to a

2271
03:20:35,424 --> 03:20:39,166
a poll in my yard saying that this is going to be permit parking now.

2272
03:20:39,946 --> 03:20:41,787
So that is my grievance.

2273
03:20:41,867 --> 03:20:48,730
I don't feel that paying to park in front of my house is the right answer here.

2274
03:20:48,790 --> 03:20:48,990
So.

2275
03:20:49,770 --> 03:20:49,950
Yeah.

2276
03:20:50,571 --> 03:20:54,632
Well, the main thing that I think this body can offer you is at least a place to air the grievance.

2277
03:20:54,712 --> 03:20:55,173
Yeah.

2278
03:20:55,673 --> 03:20:56,813
We don't set the parking policy.

2279
03:20:56,853 --> 03:20:58,594
Yeah, so where does this go from here, I guess?

2280
03:20:58,674 --> 03:21:01,876
Yeah, so the council doesn't set the parking policy for the city.

2281
03:21:01,896 --> 03:21:03,056
Right, that, I knew that.

2282
03:21:03,076 --> 03:21:04,237
The traffic commission does.

2283
03:21:06,438 --> 03:21:10,119
With the GLX zone parking, it's a little bit different.

2284
03:21:10,499 --> 03:21:14,880
It used to be street by street, and so folks would petition for their street.

2285
03:21:15,280 --> 03:21:25,382
The GLX, the parking traffic commission decided to move to this zone, which is probably why, it was definitely why you guys had that shift where you didn't have permit before, but now you do.

2286
03:21:25,442 --> 03:21:27,843
You can file a petition with the traffic commission.

2287
03:21:30,498 --> 03:21:39,387
My guess is that the response will be... Oh, I know what the response will be, but I felt like every year, and especially when I have to go in and pay that money, it fries me.

2288
03:21:39,667 --> 03:21:40,448
It really fries me.

2289
03:21:40,628 --> 03:21:43,511
And I can definitely understand how frustrating that is.

2290
03:21:44,431 --> 03:21:50,557
And I know in the past, if you lived in the city, you had to have 50% participation on your street to get a permit.

2291
03:21:51,627 --> 03:21:52,408
We didn't ask for it.

2292
03:21:52,808 --> 03:21:52,988
Right.

2293
03:21:53,388 --> 03:21:53,568
Yeah.

2294
03:21:53,709 --> 03:21:57,131
And that was the shift with that with the zone versus the street by street.

2295
03:21:57,591 --> 03:22:02,535
And so that was that that was the traffic commission's approach to the GLX.

2296
03:22:02,635 --> 03:22:05,437
Now that would be the next step.

2297
03:22:05,898 --> 03:22:07,059
I do have a question for you.

2298
03:22:07,079 --> 03:22:07,919
Yeah.

2299
03:22:08,219 --> 03:22:10,961
Which is you know when the train came in.

2300
03:22:12,007 --> 03:22:16,710
or since the permit parking, have you seen like a lot more people trying to park on your street or change?

2301
03:22:16,730 --> 03:22:16,970
No.

2302
03:22:16,990 --> 03:22:17,111
Okay.

2303
03:22:17,131 --> 03:22:28,578
The parking has not been any different from, and I live, I bought Tufts property, so I'm right behind Cousins Gym, and in the 28 years I've lived there, we have never had issues with students parking there.

2304
03:22:29,479 --> 03:22:32,921
other people from around the community, it's always been able to find parking.

2305
03:22:32,961 --> 03:22:34,081
We have four cars in our house.

2306
03:22:34,582 --> 03:22:34,742
Yeah.

2307
03:22:35,002 --> 03:22:38,604
So, and then to buy, I have to get passes to park there now.

2308
03:22:38,684 --> 03:22:43,086
So, it's just, it's an added expense that we weren't ready for.

2309
03:22:43,566 --> 03:22:43,746
Yeah.

2310
03:22:43,966 --> 03:22:48,929
And I'm guessing it also probably doesn't, you're not using that GLX pass other places in the zone.

2311
03:22:48,949 --> 03:22:49,189
No.

2312
03:22:49,449 --> 03:22:52,691
And I don't think any other people in the GLX zone are doing that.

2313
03:22:52,751 --> 03:22:54,572
I think they're walking to the train or

2314
03:22:56,321 --> 03:22:58,644
If they're taking the train at all, you know.

2315
03:22:59,325 --> 03:23:04,731
I haven't seen any hiccup or pickup in the amount of people parking in our neighborhood.

2316
03:23:05,632 --> 03:23:07,073
At least on the other end where I am.

2317
03:23:07,514 --> 03:23:09,296
I appreciate you coming to us.

2318
03:23:09,396 --> 03:23:12,199
I understand your frustration.

2319
03:23:12,219 --> 03:23:15,823
So the next thing is to traffic commission?

2320
03:23:15,863 --> 03:23:16,023
Yes.

2321
03:23:18,205 --> 03:23:23,327
Again, I think they're probably going to say we've moved to this zone, and it's a zone, and that's what it's going to be.

2322
03:23:23,848 --> 03:23:32,091
But, you know, it's always possible to at least go to them and have them hear you out, even maybe for your block of Huma if there's no parking issue.

2323
03:23:33,152 --> 03:23:38,094
You know, I can't say whether or not they'll do anything, but you can always file a petition with them.

2324
03:23:38,334 --> 03:23:39,955
And Councillor Scarpelli wants to say something as well.

2325
03:23:40,315 --> 03:23:40,995
Councillor Scarpelli.

2326
03:23:41,155 --> 03:23:44,837
At that point, I think that if we can, it might be something that, you know,

2327
03:23:46,498 --> 03:23:47,219
Plans change.

2328
03:23:47,499 --> 03:23:51,664
So maybe once everything was put forth, it was put forth as an area.

2329
03:23:52,085 --> 03:23:58,653
But if we see a certain street that really is not impacting the process, maybe it could be shifted.

2330
03:23:59,173 --> 03:24:03,399
So I mean, maybe that would be the ask with the Traffic Commission.

2331
03:24:03,539 --> 03:24:05,161
And then if not, you know,

2332
03:24:06,153 --> 03:24:13,958
reach out to your city councilor, Zach Beers, or Emily Lazaro, who topped the ticket, and maybe they could put a resolution through.

2333
03:24:14,018 --> 03:24:22,543
We can put a resolution through that could ask maybe that we ask our traffic commissioner, traffic engineer, maybe to take another look at that district.

2334
03:24:23,063 --> 03:24:24,083
And maybe it's a shift.

2335
03:24:24,143 --> 03:24:26,844
Maybe we're seeing a street over on the other side.

2336
03:24:26,904 --> 03:24:29,045
We're seeing that maybe this would help.

2337
03:24:29,225 --> 03:24:33,527
So maybe after time, because it has been a little while now, so maybe that might help.

2338
03:24:33,767 --> 03:24:33,967
So.

2339
03:24:33,987 --> 03:24:34,267
All right.

2340
03:24:34,287 --> 03:24:34,387
Yeah.

2341
03:24:34,407 --> 03:24:34,927
All right.

2342
03:24:34,947 --> 03:24:35,127
Great.

2343
03:24:35,368 --> 03:24:35,688
Thank you.

2344
03:24:36,508 --> 03:24:43,250
One other thing I heard you mention is, you know, you've kind of felt like you have to pay, but there are other parts of the city that don't have to pay.

2345
03:24:43,270 --> 03:24:44,091
Yeah, there are.

2346
03:24:44,111 --> 03:24:46,331
They live on bus lines real close to their bus line.

2347
03:24:46,351 --> 03:24:47,592
You know, they don't have to pay to park there.

2348
03:24:47,940 --> 03:24:48,761
Yeah, and I guess.

2349
03:24:48,781 --> 03:24:49,421
I'm just making a point.

2350
03:24:49,441 --> 03:24:50,162
It's a valid point.

2351
03:24:50,522 --> 03:24:51,763
Yeah, it's a completely valid point.

2352
03:24:51,823 --> 03:24:58,729
And I, you know, it's not the way I like to think about it, but I just want to kind of think it out, think out that point.

2353
03:24:59,389 --> 03:25:12,760
If, I think part of why this is feeling different is, you know, it's been the street by street for a long time, and that's kind of given a lot of local, very hyper local kind of control over the permit parking situation to the people on the street, right?

2354
03:25:14,181 --> 03:25:16,922
And this is, represents kind of a shift into more of a zone model.

2355
03:25:17,362 --> 03:25:21,285
But you see in a lot of other cities that the whole, you know, when they do that, they do the whole city.

2356
03:25:21,705 --> 03:25:24,967
There's a zone for the whole, you know, each city, part of the city has a zone.

2357
03:25:25,427 --> 03:25:27,168
So everybody's being, paying something.

2358
03:25:28,509 --> 03:25:30,870
Would that, would you feel different if everybody in the city had to pay?

2359
03:25:31,629 --> 03:25:35,490
Yeah, but I don't want to sit here and do that because now I'm going to have a... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

2360
03:25:35,510 --> 03:25:35,690
Exactly.

2361
03:25:35,770 --> 03:25:38,411
I'm going to be responsible for everybody in the same thing.

2362
03:25:38,611 --> 03:25:39,911
And you absolutely wouldn't be.

2363
03:25:39,931 --> 03:25:42,672
I just wanted to kind of do the thought experiment.

2364
03:25:42,692 --> 03:25:46,172
No, I understand because I know there are other cities around here that are like that.

2365
03:25:46,432 --> 03:25:46,813
Yeah.

2366
03:25:46,893 --> 03:25:48,273
I believe Somerville is one of them.

2367
03:25:48,493 --> 03:25:48,833
Exactly.

2368
03:25:48,853 --> 03:25:49,833
You have to pay to park there.

2369
03:25:49,973 --> 03:25:54,374
And that's one of the things I like about Medford is that we're not on that kind of a system.

2370
03:25:54,494 --> 03:25:56,415
But again, we didn't ask for it.

2371
03:25:56,795 --> 03:25:57,715
That was forced on us.

2372
03:25:57,795 --> 03:26:01,296
Now, many of the streets in the ZLX zone, GLX zone,

2373
03:26:02,596 --> 03:26:04,537
already had permitted parking.

2374
03:26:04,877 --> 03:26:09,818
So, I really think this was meant to help those streets that already had the permits.

2375
03:26:11,118 --> 03:26:11,718
We didn't have it.

2376
03:26:11,938 --> 03:26:15,539
So, that's my soapbox.

2377
03:26:15,819 --> 03:26:19,620
Well, thank you and we appreciate you coming down and waiting until 10 to have that.

2378
03:26:19,640 --> 03:26:22,741
I tried to get on the Zoom call but I couldn't get the link.

2379
03:26:23,101 --> 03:26:23,981
Oh, okay.

2380
03:26:24,021 --> 03:26:27,922
Feel free to email me with a technical issue or about this or anything you want.

2381
03:26:28,062 --> 03:26:28,262
All right.

2382
03:26:28,322 --> 03:26:28,602
Thank you.

2383
03:26:28,622 --> 03:26:28,822
Great.

2384
03:26:28,922 --> 03:26:29,462
Thanks, Robin.

2385
03:26:36,260 --> 03:26:39,262
All right, now we're just in general public participation.

2386
03:26:40,503 --> 03:26:42,605
So anything you want for three minutes, Simon?

2387
03:26:43,626 --> 03:26:51,592
Okay, I have like a few questions just about like stuff that I've heard since the last meeting and then just like a couple of comments.

2388
03:26:52,712 --> 03:26:58,557
First of all, I was wondering, I remember it was mentioned something about like meetings by ward or something of that nature.

2389
03:26:58,577 --> 03:27:00,939
I think that was mentioned during the inauguration.

2390
03:27:00,979 --> 03:27:03,100
I was just wondering what's happening with that.

2391
03:27:04,728 --> 03:27:12,934
And then the other thing is that one of the things I've noticed when trying to look on the city website at the current ordinances is that they're not particularly updated.

2392
03:27:12,974 --> 03:27:21,100
So I wondered if there's like anything that's happening around that or if there's anything that the council could do to push for some more updates on that.

2393
03:27:23,972 --> 03:27:52,359
And then also one of the things, and I promise I'm not making this a bit, but as I've traveled through the Route 60 Rotary Board, one of the things I've noticed is that the continuity of maintenance, especially with shoveling with snow, hasn't been good at all on the state's end especially, and there hasn't really been any sort of like shoveling, and this is a thing that happened when I used to go down through Webster Street as well,

2394
03:27:55,020 --> 03:28:00,163
But I wonder if there could be some way that we could push on the state to do more around that.

2395
03:28:00,804 --> 03:28:13,932
And especially I think there might be, it seemed like there was perhaps maybe a bit of a dead zone where, over by where the Black Dahlia Memorial is, because of how it's sort of on the edge of city and state property.

2396
03:28:15,475 --> 03:28:33,530
And then, oh, and then also one of the things I've noticed when trying to look at what our committees and whatnot of the city are doing is that it's very difficult to access meeting materials or like things such as like the agenda, sort of like the agenda materials like the city council provides.

2397
03:28:34,031 --> 03:28:35,993
And I wonder if there could be more done around that.

2398
03:28:36,033 --> 03:28:47,405
And then just through the comments, A, haranguing our state delegations is always a good idea, especially like I mentioned earlier.

2399
03:28:47,786 --> 03:28:51,350
Private ways, there's a whole lot of other things I can mention.

2400
03:28:51,930 --> 03:28:59,176
There's much time and also I don't know if everyone has seen but there are 11 ballot questions that could possibly on the ballot.

2401
03:28:59,256 --> 03:29:08,283
So I would recommend everyone at least take a look at that and especially how that would impact the city because a lot of them are likely to have some amount of impact where it be.

2402
03:29:09,047 --> 03:29:20,732
the one trying to ban recreational marijuana or trying to cut the state income tax because it's really going to be a year where there's a lot of potential for impact on the city itself.

2403
03:29:21,812 --> 03:29:22,312
Yeah, thank you.

2404
03:29:25,354 --> 03:29:25,714
Thank you.

2405
03:29:25,734 --> 03:29:26,774
I think I got most of them down.

2406
03:29:27,634 --> 03:29:35,097
Neighborhood board meetings, the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee is going to start meeting on that in the next few weeks to start planning those out.

2407
03:29:35,117 --> 03:29:36,478
I think we're looking at at least

2408
03:29:37,957 --> 03:29:47,105
I don't want to over promise certainly at least one a year maybe two a year in each ward slash neighborhood ordinances updates.

2409
03:29:48,226 --> 03:29:53,251
Vice President Lazaro and acting clerk Alicio that's those are the folks for that one.

2410
03:29:53,651 --> 03:29:56,914
We're hoping to really start getting getting that.

2411
03:29:57,835 --> 03:29:58,996
It's been an ongoing issue.

2412
03:29:59,496 --> 03:30:01,398
There was a backlog in the clerk's office around.

2413
03:30:02,263 --> 03:30:10,465
ordinances and also some long wait times with KP Law on some of the ordinances getting back from them.

2414
03:30:10,985 --> 03:30:13,246
And so Muni Code hasn't been updated in a while.

2415
03:30:13,566 --> 03:30:24,048
I know that was something that was a goal for June and July and Rich and I had been working on that with our former clerk and then he went on leave.

2416
03:30:24,168 --> 03:30:25,888
So sorry about that.

2417
03:30:26,308 --> 03:30:27,429
Route 60 Rotary.

2418
03:30:29,862 --> 03:30:32,783
I'm guessing you mean the shoveling of the sidewalks and the underpass, right?

2419
03:30:33,504 --> 03:30:37,165
So it's not really as much of an issue under the underpass, mostly the approaches.

2420
03:30:37,645 --> 03:30:38,125
The approaches.

2421
03:30:38,145 --> 03:30:55,012
Because especially like, I especially, actually it's kind of all four of the approaches that you have to the rotary, but I especially notice it on the northbound, on the, sorry, east side of 93, where it's particularly not maintained.

2422
03:30:55,072 --> 03:30:58,034
And also the part which wraps around the,

2423
03:30:59,612 --> 03:31:06,674
which wraps around oak bluffs is also just straight up has not been maintained even before this project happened.

2424
03:31:08,275 --> 03:31:13,976
It was actually blocked for a long time by leaves and other debris.

2425
03:31:14,357 --> 03:31:16,077
I could also bring this up at the traffic commission.

2426
03:31:16,097 --> 03:31:16,917
I mean, it's not a big deal.

2427
03:31:16,957 --> 03:31:28,621
Yeah, I mean, I think if you could, if you have photos and maybe even Google Maps with the areas specifically circled, then we could probably work with code enforcement

2428
03:31:29,126 --> 03:31:36,572
to see who the abutters are, and if the abutters are the city, then essentially it's like the way that it works.

2429
03:31:36,632 --> 03:31:41,917
So it sounds to me like MassDOT is clearing the parts that it owns.

2430
03:31:42,317 --> 03:31:42,437
No.

2431
03:31:42,497 --> 03:31:42,958
Oh, they're not.

2432
03:31:43,018 --> 03:31:45,300
I'm saying that MassDOT is clearing the parts that it owns.

2433
03:31:45,320 --> 03:31:45,520
Oh, MassDOT.

2434
03:31:45,540 --> 03:31:49,724
OK, so these are MassDOT properties approaching the underpass that are not getting cleared.

2435
03:31:49,824 --> 03:31:49,984
Great.

2436
03:31:50,004 --> 03:31:53,427
Yeah, this is just like the sidewalks along the public way, yeah.

2437
03:31:53,507 --> 03:31:55,769
Maybe Councilor Zaro, Councilor Callahan,

2438
03:31:59,443 --> 03:32:00,524
Well, this is just the rotary.

2439
03:32:03,145 --> 03:32:04,065
Vice President Lazar.

2440
03:32:04,266 --> 03:32:09,268
You know, I liked Kit more as my vice president.

2441
03:32:09,608 --> 03:32:11,009
I called her Councillor Collins all the time.

2442
03:32:11,029 --> 03:32:12,309
She never gave me any crap for it.

2443
03:32:15,289 --> 03:32:15,889
Oh, boy.

2444
03:32:17,550 --> 03:32:25,051
Meeting materials for committees, the program that we use is available to every board and commission in the city.

2445
03:32:25,391 --> 03:32:28,552
We just need to get them trained on it, and then they would all be in one place.

2446
03:32:28,652 --> 03:32:32,593
So I would love if they were using our service.

2447
03:32:33,113 --> 03:32:33,173
OK.

2448
03:32:33,693 --> 03:32:38,314
Yeah, but that is a mayor administration question.

2449
03:32:39,574 --> 03:32:39,874
Thank you.

2450
03:32:40,614 --> 03:32:42,315
And Rich has one thing for you too, Simon.

2451
03:32:42,515 --> 03:32:43,575
Go ahead.

2452
03:32:44,945 --> 03:32:45,485
Keep forgetting that.

2453
03:32:46,086 --> 03:32:53,990
Simon, if you send me an email, I can add you to the agenda disbursement list, which I created an address book for it.

2454
03:32:54,010 --> 03:32:57,692
So we'll just add you to that, and you'll automatically get one.

2455
03:32:58,492 --> 03:32:58,692
OK.

2456
03:32:58,992 --> 03:32:59,412
Thank you.

2457
03:32:59,913 --> 03:33:00,233
Awesome.

2458
03:33:00,433 --> 03:33:00,793
Thank you.

2459
03:33:01,954 --> 03:33:02,314
All right.

2460
03:33:03,294 --> 03:33:09,938
Potentially last but not least, unless anyone else on the meeting wants to raise their hand on Zoom, we have Gaston Fiori.

2461
03:33:09,978 --> 03:33:10,638
Name and address and record.

2462
03:33:10,658 --> 03:33:11,479
Gaston Fiori, 61 Signature Road.

2463
03:33:11,519 --> 03:33:13,980
I just wanted to bring up that, so I heard

2464
03:33:14,828 --> 03:33:18,053
And I think it's important for us to be able to do that.

2465
03:33:18,073 --> 03:33:20,235
And I think it's important for us to be able to do that.

2466
03:33:32,345 --> 03:33:36,066
And they were trying very hard to see how to deal with that.

2467
03:33:36,846 --> 03:33:44,089
So I just wonder whether we should take a look at what's happening here in Medford.

2468
03:33:45,729 --> 03:33:54,872
Because I think it was the fire chief or someone else of the experts that talked about this that said there's some mental health issues, we're sort of strained.

2469
03:33:55,512 --> 03:34:14,038
So, and I think if we should bring that as part of the discussion, I mean, I'm going to do my job on it, but I think it would be interesting to see, you know, where is there certain things that are sort of like disproportionately requiring emergency services, and if so, what can we do about it, because, you know, maybe

2470
03:34:15,297 --> 03:34:28,484
I don't know, I mean, they should have more personnel, maybe we should legislate that, it's not clear, but I think, you know, this costs money, and we need to make sure that, you know, everyone has access to emergency services, right?

2471
03:34:28,524 --> 03:34:38,229
So I think it's worthwhile, even though I heard in NANACommittee there's a huge problem over there, I think it's worthwhile for us, now that we are sort of discussing this contract, to take a look at this.

2472
03:34:38,509 --> 03:34:39,890
So, thank you.

2473
03:34:40,210 --> 03:34:40,470
Thank you.

2474
03:34:41,433 --> 03:34:44,595
All right, we do have one on Zoom, so one raised hand.

2475
03:34:45,836 --> 03:34:48,657
Mr. Castanetti, name and address for the record, please.

2476
03:34:49,338 --> 03:34:51,139
And you have three minutes.

2477
03:34:55,441 --> 03:35:01,485
Congratulations on your new city council and your first meeting of 2026.

2478
03:35:01,945 --> 03:35:05,707
And I have no further comment except God bless.

2479
03:35:06,147 --> 03:35:06,528
Good night.

2480
03:35:08,669 --> 03:35:09,249
Thank you, Andy.

2481
03:35:10,030 --> 03:35:10,470
Happy New Year.

2482
03:35:12,062 --> 03:35:12,422
You too.

2483
03:35:12,662 --> 03:35:19,085
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn, seconded by Vice President Collins.

2484
03:35:23,066 --> 03:35:24,187
See, what's worse?

2485
03:35:24,327 --> 03:35:24,807
What's worse?

2486
03:35:26,147 --> 03:35:26,688
What's worse?

2487
03:35:28,728 --> 03:35:29,509
Two years.

2488
03:35:29,669 --> 03:35:30,429
Two years.

2489
03:35:31,569 --> 03:35:35,791
Okay, it's... You want to be Councilor Lazaro, Vice President Collins?

2490
03:35:35,891 --> 03:35:37,912
I'll get Vice President Lazaro 50% of the time.

2491
03:35:41,671 --> 03:35:46,618
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Lazaro, to adjourn.

2492
03:35:46,779 --> 03:35:47,624
All those in favor?

2493
03:35:48,328 --> 03:35:48,811
Opposed?

2494
03:35:48,871 --> 03:35:49,635
Motion passes.
