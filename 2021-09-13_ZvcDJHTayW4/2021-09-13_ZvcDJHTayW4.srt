[SPEAKER_15]: consent agenda is approved.

37
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:58,400
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau?

38
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:11,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, on the minutes for June 14th, I have only one requested change on page six or page seven, depending on which version you're looking at.

39
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:17,074
[SPEAKER_08]: There is a public comment speaker named Paul with no last name.

40
00:02:18,115 --> 00:02:23,319
[SPEAKER_08]: This was not me and I just would like it to be reflected that it was not school committee member Rousseau.

41
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,520
[SPEAKER_08]: just for clarity.

42
00:02:27,361 --> 00:02:31,482
[SPEAKER_08]: And if that's acceptable, I make a motion to approve these with that as amended.

43
00:02:36,283 --> 00:02:37,224
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, I think.

44
00:02:37,564 --> 00:02:40,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we want to approve the consent agenda.

45
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:41,105
[SPEAKER_15]: So do you want to?

46
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:42,505
[SPEAKER_08]: We held this item.

47
00:02:42,585 --> 00:02:49,867
[SPEAKER_15]: So we held the Okay, so this is the modification to the June 14 2021 minutes.

48
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:50,347
[SPEAKER_15]: Gotcha.

49
00:02:50,908 --> 00:02:51,848
[SPEAKER_15]: So is there a motion

50
00:02:53,593 --> 00:02:55,993
[SPEAKER_15]: by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Kreatz as amended.

51
00:02:56,073 --> 00:02:58,094
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Kreatz, I mean, by Member Van der Kloot.

52
00:02:58,114 --> 00:02:59,834
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Kreatz, did you have a question?

53
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:09,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, because I think we got, and I might just be misreading some emails, but I think we got an email from Suzy.

54
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:10,696
[SPEAKER_13]: She made some changes.

55
00:03:11,036 --> 00:03:11,476
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that right?

56
00:03:11,636 --> 00:03:14,257
[SPEAKER_13]: It was a change after that.

57
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,837
[SPEAKER_13]: I've already put that change in front of her.

58
00:03:17,578 --> 00:03:19,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, all right, so we'll see that the next time.

59
00:03:26,509 --> 00:03:32,854
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Van der Kloot to approve the minutes from June 14, 2021 as amended.

60
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:34,175
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

61
00:03:34,195 --> 00:03:34,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

62
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:35,776
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

63
00:03:37,157 --> 00:03:38,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Minutes are approved.

64
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:41,743
[SPEAKER_15]: There are no reports of subcommittee.

65
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,866
[SPEAKER_15]: Number five, we have the report of the superintendent.

66
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:59,623
[SPEAKER_15]: First up is summer programming in school opening update assistant superintendents for elementary and secondary education and the director of pupil services report on the conclusion of extended school year acceleration academics.

67
00:04:00,894 --> 00:04:11,543
[SPEAKER_15]: and Camp Mustang during the summer of 2021 and the experiences of students and families in the return of fall in-person learning for the start of the 2021-2022 school year.

68
00:04:12,023 --> 00:04:15,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Current enrollment data will also be shared at this time.

69
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:17,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

70
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:21,551
[SPEAKER_10]: I will start with the extended school year programming update.

71
00:04:21,651 --> 00:04:25,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone has a report in their folder that they received.

72
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:26,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Can everyone hear me okay?

73
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:39,328
[SPEAKER_10]: So each summer the special education department provides extended school year services for students who are at risk for substantial regression or experience difficulty with recruitment of learn skills.

74
00:04:40,429 --> 00:04:45,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Other factors may be considered when determining a student's need for extended school year services.

75
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:55,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Decision about ESY programming are made by IEP teams on an individual basis, taking into consideration the unique needs of the child.

76
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:05,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Students enrolled in a district-funded out-of-district placement typically receive any necessary summer program at those programs.

77
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:10,890
[SPEAKER_10]: However, the large majority of summer services are provided through in-district programming.

78
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:21,581
[SPEAKER_10]: This year we had 161 special education students, students with disabilities, and the method extended school year program during the summer of 2021.

79
00:05:22,802 --> 00:05:28,507
[SPEAKER_10]: All of these special education programs were housed at the Roberts and at Medford High School.

80
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:34,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Due to the complexity of student needs, there are a wide range of programs operating this summer.

81
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:49,981
[SPEAKER_10]: They included the connections programs pre-K through five, MEEP, our developmental program, our access programs, including the elementary, middle, and high school, project transition, and the learning group program.

82
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,302
[SPEAKER_10]: We had several programs that ran six weeks.

83
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:59,263
[SPEAKER_10]: There were four week programs, and there were also tutoring and related services that were provided.

84
00:06:00,504 --> 00:06:07,028
[SPEAKER_10]: As well as a range of specialized programs, there are a range of services that were provided.

85
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:11,151
[SPEAKER_10]: We offered tutoring in the areas of math, English, and reading.

86
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:21,258
[SPEAKER_10]: We also provided related services in the areas of speech, occupational therapy, physical therapy, counseling, as well as social skills groups.

87
00:06:22,573 --> 00:06:32,598
[SPEAKER_10]: The staff required to meet the comprehensive needs of Medford students with disabilities who participated in this ESI programming are listed in your information.

88
00:06:32,618 --> 00:06:37,240
[SPEAKER_10]: We had two program supervisors, they split the six week program.

89
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:47,958
[SPEAKER_10]: We had 17 teachers to her special education reading specialists, 27 power professionals, seven speech therapists.

90
00:06:48,738 --> 00:07:01,268
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a teacher of the deaf, three occupational therapists to physical therapists, one school adjustment Councilor to school nurses to BCBAs and specialists.

91
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:13,303
[SPEAKER_10]: We also continued to collaborate with Summer Fun and Medford Recreational Programs to ensure that students were able to access both educational and recreational opportunities this summer.

92
00:07:14,504 --> 00:07:27,976
[SPEAKER_10]: In closing, the success of the extended school year program was a result of all the hard work and dedication from our special education staff who continued their commitment in meeting the needs of our most vulnerable students.

93
00:07:28,877 --> 00:07:34,398
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to all the staff who worked this summer.

94
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:54,942
[SPEAKER_10]: Also a special thanks to Kim Clinton and Aaron Pels, scheduling services and transportation, as well as ongoing collaboration with parents and staff.

95
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:55,983
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

96
00:07:57,323 --> 00:07:57,923
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Miss Bowen.

97
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:01,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau.

98
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:02,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

99
00:08:02,952 --> 00:08:18,559
[SPEAKER_08]: I just also want to reiterate the thank you to the staff working over the summer if ever there was a summer you needed to not work, it was this summer, like, in a whole lifetime, right, and these, these people came, because they were incredible.

100
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,401
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, and it speaks volumes of them so thank you.

101
00:08:32,494 --> 00:08:34,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

102
00:08:35,335 --> 00:08:36,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Myself and Ms.

103
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:47,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Galussi will be speaking on our start of the school year and some really great opportunities that presented themselves as a result of increased funding from both the state and federal government.

104
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:49,482
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to hand it over to Ms.

105
00:08:49,522 --> 00:08:50,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Galussi at this time.

106
00:08:51,963 --> 00:08:52,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

107
00:08:53,563 --> 00:08:59,146
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna ask just to advance, I'll speak on this slide, but I'd like the pictures to be shown as I speak.

108
00:09:00,347 --> 00:09:11,491
[SPEAKER_14]: So at the elementary level, we had the wonderful opportunity to offer two accelerated learning programs over the summer per, as Dr. Cushing mentioned, the DESE grant.

109
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:14,151
[SPEAKER_14]: The first one was focused on early readers.

110
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:24,535
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was for students that would be entering kindergarten, first grade, and second grade, because we know that the pandemic caused a large disruption to those early reading skills.

111
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:31,780
[SPEAKER_14]: So the pictures that you see here are just snapshots of some of the activities that happened throughout the week.

112
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:36,144
[SPEAKER_14]: So these accelerated camps were a week long and it was all day.

113
00:09:36,164 --> 00:09:39,226
[SPEAKER_14]: So it was like a typical school day, 8.30 to 2 p.m.

114
00:09:39,827 --> 00:09:46,392
[SPEAKER_14]: It did involve a period of physical education and lunch and recess.

115
00:09:47,433 --> 00:09:50,436
[SPEAKER_14]: At this camp, it was dedicated to early reading skills.

116
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:57,862
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have, as I've previously mentioned at a school committee meeting, we are partnered with a program called hill for literacy.

117
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:08,288
[SPEAKER_14]: and they are offering professional development year-long this year to our K-2 staff on their ECRI program, which is Enhanced Core Reading Instruction.

118
00:10:08,869 --> 00:10:18,898
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we utilized the staff from Hill for Literacy to provide professional development to the licensed Medford educators that worked this camp.

119
00:10:19,932 --> 00:10:32,717
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were able to work with Hill for Literacy and myself on streamlining the ECRI piece to go back into our curriculum and pull out those needed skills that would help advance them for the next grade.

120
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:41,428
[SPEAKER_14]: In going around to the schools, it was just wonderful to see how engaged the students were and how wonderful the teachers were.

121
00:10:41,448 --> 00:10:51,577
[SPEAKER_14]: Each kindergarten, first grade, and second grade at each school held a program from a licensed Medford Public Schools teacher.

122
00:10:52,098 --> 00:10:56,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Some classrooms, if needed, a paraprofessional was there for support.

123
00:10:57,588 --> 00:11:01,554
[SPEAKER_14]: The second wonderful opportunity, if you don't mind Dr. Cushing advancing two slides.

124
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:11,849
[SPEAKER_14]: The second wonderful opportunity we had was to offer a math acceleration camp that was for incoming grades three, four and five students at every building.

125
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:24,413
[SPEAKER_14]: For this, we offered the teachers training from a company called Better Lessons, but specifically targeted on differentiation techniques in the area of mathematics.

126
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:27,614
[SPEAKER_14]: So the day and the schedule was set up the same way.

127
00:11:27,634 --> 00:11:28,915
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a full day of school.

128
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:40,798
[SPEAKER_14]: Students were engaged in physical education, math and recess, but they also were engaged in various math activities throughout the day from core content knowledge to math games, centers,

129
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:47,361
[SPEAKER_14]: We wanted to get the core curriculum in, but also make it feel like it's summer camp, which increases engagement.

130
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:49,202
[SPEAKER_14]: So here you can see pictures.

131
00:11:49,262 --> 00:12:02,809
[SPEAKER_14]: The one on the left was of a fourth grade classroom where they had to work on real life tiny house project, where they had to map out to scale.

132
00:12:02,829 --> 00:12:09,393
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe it was called tiny house, but I believe this is a scaled school bus.

133
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:19,240
[SPEAKER_14]: And then on the right, you can just see some of the fun activities that students engaged in to help with the core content, but also make it that camp feel.

134
00:12:20,161 --> 00:12:29,709
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think, and now I'm going to just pass the microphone to Dr. Cushing to speak about his.

135
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, so the secondary math acceleration camps, that was the only option afforded to us by DESE.

136
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:42,836
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was for rising eighth grade students and rising 10th grade students.

137
00:12:43,736 --> 00:12:46,758
[SPEAKER_09]: We were able to, I apologize, this is an error.

138
00:12:47,478 --> 00:12:51,960
[SPEAKER_09]: We originally only had four math teachers for the middle school.

139
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,623
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually had five because we were able to continue to add students.

140
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:02,346
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and this was actually the first opportunity for our engagement special, uh, re-engagement specialists.

141
00:13:02,826 --> 00:13:06,948
[SPEAKER_09]: They really worked the phones, uh, to reach out to our high school students.

142
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:14,031
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we had really great response from our middle school parents, uh, and we needed just a little bit more support for our high school students.

143
00:13:14,632 --> 00:13:20,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we ended up with about 30 students on the high school side and we ended up with

144
00:13:22,255 --> 00:13:31,379
[SPEAKER_09]: If I remember correctly, just under 60 on the middle school side, so we had four math teachers at the middle school one special education teacher who co teaches.

145
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:39,222
[SPEAKER_09]: So she brought a really unique skill set to be able to support and assist our students as they went through these math acceleration camps.

146
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:44,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Over the next year, you'll hear a lot about acceleration, not remediation.

147
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:56,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Acceleration is meeting kids where they are, giving them just-in-time skills in order to move them forward as quickly and readily as possible, rather than spending time going backwards and trying to build on things that were missed.

148
00:13:56,854 --> 00:14:01,597
[SPEAKER_09]: You're hopefully going to be able to accelerate the students with the just-in-time skills.

149
00:14:01,897 --> 00:14:05,020
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's why they're called math acceleration camps.

150
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,881
[SPEAKER_09]: So the standards that they were focused on were grade seven and eight content standards.

151
00:14:10,901 --> 00:14:20,124
[SPEAKER_09]: What we did was with Fiza Khan, our math director, we went and looked at the specific standards that really bridged seventh and eighth grade, right?

152
00:14:20,164 --> 00:14:23,005
[SPEAKER_09]: To really support students as they move forward into eighth grade.

153
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:31,527
[SPEAKER_09]: And once again, in 10th grade, we went and we looked at the various skills that could be bridged between two very disparate subjects,

154
00:14:33,008 --> 00:14:35,589
[SPEAKER_09]: that are between freshman and sophomore year.

155
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:48,477
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we were able to put in, we were able to observe all the teachers in the program, and it gave us a really good opportunity to see the teachers in action, working with students, engaging them.

156
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:54,581
[SPEAKER_09]: And in small groups, the DESE grant limited the groups to no more than 12 students.

157
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:59,664
[SPEAKER_09]: So there was some really good interaction between the students and the adults.

158
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:17,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so the, the other wonderful opportunity that we were able to provide method public school students is camp Mustang camp Mustang which we had said connecting for a new school year had a social emotional.

159
00:15:18,795 --> 00:15:19,435
[SPEAKER_14]: priority.

160
00:15:20,316 --> 00:15:32,660
[SPEAKER_14]: So unlike the acceleration camps where we had to use data to invite students that we knew would benefit from that opportunity, Camp Mustang was open to all of our Medford Public Schools students.

161
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,421
[SPEAKER_14]: We had that at every level.

162
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:38,502
[SPEAKER_14]: So in the elementary, there were three days of Camp Mustang.

163
00:15:39,562 --> 00:15:41,443
[SPEAKER_14]: at the middle school two and at the high school one.

164
00:15:41,463 --> 00:15:48,607
[SPEAKER_14]: I will just speak, if you don't mind, please advancing to the, we're going to just show you some pictures from Camp Mustang.

165
00:15:48,647 --> 00:16:01,775
[SPEAKER_14]: So because this was a social emotional priority, the whole point when we think of students that needed to have this transition to connect again to school,

166
00:16:02,515 --> 00:16:06,158
[SPEAKER_14]: We wanted the students that may not have been in school for 18 months.

167
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:13,184
[SPEAKER_14]: We wanted the students that were a little anxious of what school would look like because last year was so atypical.

168
00:16:13,884 --> 00:16:27,055
[SPEAKER_14]: And so when the students came in, our focus was on building back that trust and those relationships with the school, which is why our priority was to have Camp Mustang at every single building.

169
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,016
[SPEAKER_14]: not a district-wide program.

170
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:30,897
[SPEAKER_14]: We wanted the students immersed in their buildings.

171
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:39,543
[SPEAKER_14]: So some of those activities, we had activities where they were within their classroom, their grade-level classrooms, and then activities that were building-based.

172
00:16:39,644 --> 00:16:47,869
[SPEAKER_14]: So scavenger hunts, or you can see here the use of the gymnasium, the use of the art rooms, so that they're getting used to those spaces all over again.

173
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,711
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a snack

174
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:58,257
[SPEAKER_14]: time as well as a recess time so students were able to work with their peers throughout that morning activity.

175
00:17:00,158 --> 00:17:01,980
[SPEAKER_14]: The next slide shows some pictures.

176
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:14,641
[SPEAKER_09]: So these are some of our high school students and middle school students and so what we were able to do was, you know, we put out the call to our teachers and our teachers responded really amazingly.

177
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:23,604
[SPEAKER_09]: And once again I think this really goes to a point where the grant money came in handy because we weren't turning teachers away this year.

178
00:17:24,564 --> 00:17:39,358
[SPEAKER_09]: We weren't saying like oh that's too many teachers for x number of kids know we wanted the staff that we had to try to build as many connections to try to make it as small of a group to a teacher as possible, and to try to build those lasting relationships.

179
00:17:39,918 --> 00:17:42,182
[SPEAKER_09]: so that a student feels truly connected to their school.

180
00:17:42,202 --> 00:17:54,360
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if you walk into Medford High School, a school of approximately 1200 students today or one of our middle schools that are each just under 500 students, you know, it can be an intimidating place.

181
00:17:55,021 --> 00:18:11,532
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the point was to get as many students in as possible, so that they become comfortable with their school so that just the physical environment becomes something that they know, and if they were a sixth grader when they were last in the building, and because of whatever the situation may have been.

182
00:18:12,053 --> 00:18:13,574
[SPEAKER_09]: They were remote since March 13 of 2020.

183
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:36,048
[SPEAKER_09]: They had the opportunity to get in and to feel their buildings above and beyond camp Mustang, all the principals throughout the district did a great job giving tours, providing opportunities above and beyond camp Mustang to go into their buildings to feel comfortable to know what their schools are going to be, you know, you'll see some of our students here doing the spaghetti challenge.

184
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:41,852
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, the Marshmallow Challenge with some minor adaptations for school.

185
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:47,657
[SPEAKER_09]: We make the Marshmallow Challenge, which you can see on a TED Talk.

186
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:51,320
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a great way to build team with a couple of simple supplies.

187
00:18:52,841 --> 00:19:00,507
[SPEAKER_09]: We gave the teachers the supplies they needed for games, for opportunities to really engage with kids in a way that may not be the norm.

188
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:19,187
[SPEAKER_09]: We would love to find a way to continue these types of activities for students moving forward throughout the next several years, and then on into the future, because while the delta variant through a monkey wrench in our planning, our staff proved that they were able to adapt.

189
00:19:20,749 --> 00:19:22,593
[SPEAKER_09]: to really overcome that challenge.

190
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:31,671
[SPEAKER_09]: And while we unfortunately had to have masks in place and those types of things, we were able to have extraordinarily successful camps for us moving forward.

191
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:45,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the next thing I'd like to talk about is Medford credit recovery, uh, your more traditional summer school students, uh, program for students in Medford and other schools that may want to send their students.

192
00:19:46,372 --> 00:19:53,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, this year we had 96 total students with 160 course enrollments and two non Medford students.

193
00:19:54,074 --> 00:20:00,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the courses offered are on the left-hand side of your screen, uh, along with the each unique.

194
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:02,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Individual enrollments for those courses.

195
00:20:04,017 --> 00:20:14,470
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing that I'm very proud of this year is for the first time in our history, we added two positions to this, and the first is an assistant director.

196
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:21,340
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Mr. Russo mentioned it about the stress of the past year so rather than just having everything beyond the director.

197
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:39,092
[SPEAKER_09]: we were able to put in a director, an assistant director, and they were able to offset days so that it wasn't just the burden of, okay, the entire school year, the pandemic, we're able to split the rules and responsibilities, which really awesome about that is our assistant director was able to get some really good knowledge and skills moving forward.

198
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,754
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're able to spread and diversify our knowledge base.

199
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:47,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Secondly, for the first time ever, we were also able to add an adjustment Councilor.

200
00:20:48,075 --> 00:20:49,296
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that so critical?

201
00:20:49,416 --> 00:21:01,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, as Medford Public Schools was recently featured on Fox 25 for our work on social emotional learning in the classroom, we wanted to make sure that we were ahead of the curve for our students coming back.

202
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:11,973
[SPEAKER_09]: And for those students who may have been remote or may have been hybrid or whatever it may have been, that if they were feeling a sense of crisis, if they were feeling a sense of

203
00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:20,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Misunderstanding, we had clinically trained professional in the building to support those almost 100 students.

204
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:27,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

205
00:21:27,518 --> 00:21:45,472
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so the next piece that we're going to present on is actually Dr. Riccadeli's Medford Jumpstart Instrumental Camp that she offered to families over the summer for rising students in grades four through eight.

206
00:21:45,992 --> 00:21:50,795
[SPEAKER_14]: So as many of you are aware, our instrumental programs and our

207
00:21:51,676 --> 00:21:56,337
[SPEAKER_14]: band programs start in the elementary schools at grade four and grade five.

208
00:21:57,197 --> 00:22:07,440
[SPEAKER_14]: And so there has definitely been, because of COVID, a decline in enrollment and participation in instrumental and band opportunities.

209
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,140
[SPEAKER_14]: And so Dr. Riccadeli,

210
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:17,843
[SPEAKER_14]: really worked hard on this as a way to build up participation in our programs throughout the summer.

211
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:20,124
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was a big success.

212
00:22:20,564 --> 00:22:23,526
[SPEAKER_14]: We have some pictures here that she supplied for us.

213
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:37,751
[SPEAKER_14]: But students, as you can see, strengthened their musical skills and techniques while covering topics including note reading, rhythm skills, sight reading, tuning, intonation, and instrumental terminology.

214
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:45,790
[SPEAKER_14]: The district supplied violins and various percussion instruments free of charge, so that was not a burden on families.

215
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:51,152
[SPEAKER_14]: If students were interested, they were able to join and were provided the instruments.

216
00:22:51,972 --> 00:23:01,116
[SPEAKER_14]: At the conclusion of the two-week program, students presented everything they learned in the little theater up at the high school to their families.

217
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:04,418
[SPEAKER_14]: It was largely successful.

218
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:07,084
[SPEAKER_14]: The students were very happy to be there.

219
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:12,260
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that she's looking to continue a program like this next summer as well.

220
00:23:14,172 --> 00:23:19,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just like to add that, you know, the picture in the lower right hand corner of the students in the parking lot.

221
00:23:19,615 --> 00:23:23,037
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, pictures, you know, are usually a great medium to show.

222
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:27,600
[SPEAKER_09]: This picture does not really show how amazing this program was.

223
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:33,064
[SPEAKER_09]: We had literally, it felt like the parking lot was full of students participating.

224
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:38,227
[SPEAKER_09]: It felt so good to have that life and that music back into the building.

225
00:23:38,987 --> 00:23:49,590
[SPEAKER_09]: And as Mr. Lucy just mentioned, the well Dr record Ellie is looking to continue it, what's awesome is once again the teachers are saying wow, how do we keep this going for the future.

226
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,090
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that this type of thing.

227
00:23:52,510 --> 00:24:02,173
[SPEAKER_09]: When you think of various summer camps that may be out there for Medford public schools to offer our citizens and our students is really a tremendous opportunity going above and beyond your traditional

228
00:24:02,673 --> 00:24:09,720
[SPEAKER_09]: fun, athletic, or whatever the camp may be, this offers our students that true instrumental artistic approach.

229
00:24:13,059 --> 00:24:25,729
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we just want to also mention, I know that we have reported on this before, but this year our big focus for school year 2021 to 2022 is on social emotional learning.

230
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:29,672
[SPEAKER_14]: And so at the elementary level, what does that look like?

231
00:24:29,752 --> 00:24:36,136
[SPEAKER_14]: We have responsive classroom, which we were able to implement last year during the pandemic and continue this year.

232
00:24:37,037 --> 00:24:48,802
[SPEAKER_14]: So over the summer, we were able to create support, responsive classroom support teams at every building, and they participated in a week-long training, like a train-the-trainer session this summer.

233
00:24:50,062 --> 00:24:52,023
[SPEAKER_14]: It was very intensive, but it was very rewarding.

234
00:24:52,163 --> 00:25:06,009
[SPEAKER_14]: And so what we were able to take away from that experience is not only support teams at every building, but district-wide trainers, so that we can continue offering responsive classroom training for our staff.

235
00:25:06,998 --> 00:25:27,352
[SPEAKER_14]: We have continued with our schedule to maintain that morning meeting time where every student starts their day from 830 to 915 with their peers during morning meeting and academics and services begin after that time so that all students have that opportunity to be with their peers and start their day.

236
00:25:28,112 --> 00:25:28,792
[SPEAKER_14]: collectively.

237
00:25:29,373 --> 00:25:38,396
[SPEAKER_14]: That will build that trust, that community that we want learners to have so that they can take those academic risks and feel safe in their learning environment.

238
00:25:40,437 --> 00:25:45,159
[SPEAKER_14]: So we are going to be continuing that training throughout the year with the use of that staff.

239
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:49,740
[SPEAKER_14]: We also made sure that we trained staff during the induction week.

240
00:25:50,261 --> 00:25:55,983
[SPEAKER_14]: So some of those trainers went to the new teacher training and provided responsive classroom training for the elementary teachers.

241
00:25:56,883 --> 00:26:14,286
[SPEAKER_14]: The other thing that we've done this year that I know I've reported on, but I worked collaboratively with Stacey Shulman, and we created the fifth special, which is called Nexus, and is, at the start, completely in response to the pandemic.

242
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:24,048
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know the need for targeted social-emotional assistance, as well as executive functioning skills that were lost during the pandemic time.

243
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:33,341
[SPEAKER_14]: So we know that this class may kind of like evolve over time to suit the needs of the students but at this moment for this school year.

244
00:26:34,162 --> 00:26:40,451
[SPEAKER_14]: It is a strictly social emotional focus so the curriculum that we're using when students come once a week.

245
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:44,794
[SPEAKER_14]: is a Michigan model, which is our health curriculum as the district.

246
00:26:45,154 --> 00:26:48,536
[SPEAKER_14]: And we only focus on the social emotional lessons of the Michigan model.

247
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:54,800
[SPEAKER_14]: So instead of the classroom teachers doing those lessons, the nexus teachers will now do those lessons.

248
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:06,787
[SPEAKER_14]: We're also using the zones of regulation, which has been primarily in grades K through two across the district, but we're going to expand that because those skills are just as important for grades three, four and five.

249
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:12,688
[SPEAKER_14]: And that program adapts itself to the appropriateness of the grade level.

250
00:27:13,268 --> 00:27:26,932
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to give you like a snapshot, some of the things in the zones of regulation are not just how to work on self-management skills, but it's also, there's a whole piece on like growth mindset versus fixed mindset, which are important.

251
00:27:28,673 --> 00:27:30,134
[SPEAKER_14]: important skills for students to have.

252
00:27:30,635 --> 00:27:39,783
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the other piece, once a month, Stacey Shulman and I are working hand in hand with the Nexus teachers and staff every week.

253
00:27:40,564 --> 00:27:47,270
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to weave in a executive functioning skill that is appropriate for the grade level.

254
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:51,454
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was, those are also pieces that were lost a little last year.

255
00:27:51,474 --> 00:27:51,514
[SPEAKER_14]: So

256
00:27:53,365 --> 00:28:12,728
[SPEAKER_14]: how to pack your backpack, how to work with a two pocket folder, how to take notes in the upper grades, whatever the skills are, we'll be working in collaboration with staff as well to weave in some of those executive functioning skills that were lost, but crucially important for students to be independent learners.

257
00:28:16,352 --> 00:28:18,153
[SPEAKER_09]: So social emotional learning.

258
00:28:18,253 --> 00:28:21,634
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's a focus on student needs prior to diving into the curriculum.

259
00:28:21,674 --> 00:28:30,198
[SPEAKER_09]: And while the elementary school is really focusing it on the six weeks, the high school and middle schools are focusing intently over the first three weeks of school.

260
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:44,725
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're pausing our traditional scope and sequence that we would normally have in place so that our teachers can build those relationships while touching on the curriculum, but not going full throttle ahead.

261
00:28:46,306 --> 00:28:50,669
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, as was mentioned the responsive classroom at the secondary schools.

262
00:28:51,630 --> 00:29:04,340
[SPEAKER_09]: We're really looking at restorative justice pilot at the Andrews Middle School, so that we can then see how that will take place there and then build a plan moving out for our McGlynn Middle School, as well as our high school approach.

263
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:30,870
[SPEAKER_09]: On the right-hand side of the screen, you'll see the CASEL social and emotional learning wheel that incorporates all the various aspects of students' self-management, self-awareness, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making while considering classroom, schools, family, and caregivers, and then communities.

264
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:50,059
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a well-known graphic that we're really adopting and pushing forward this year to make sure that it touches on many of the things that we're doing to really connect with students, to have students understand that this is their home.

265
00:29:50,279 --> 00:29:57,943
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where they will learn, they will feed, and that they will be supported by the faculty and staff of our school district.

266
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:07,242
[SPEAKER_14]: So in closing, we just included the enrollment numbers for you as of last week.

267
00:30:08,162 --> 00:30:11,605
[SPEAKER_14]: To note, some of the increases are at the elementary level.

268
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:17,508
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have increased one kindergarten section at three out of the four schools.

269
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:24,253
[SPEAKER_14]: So the Brooks and the Roberts have five kindergarten classes this year, and the Missittuck has four.

270
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:36,798
[SPEAKER_14]: We also increased, I don't know if you wanna speak to it, but some of Joan's specialized programming so that at the Roberts, there is an additional connections program.

271
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:41,582
[SPEAKER_14]: And at the Brooks Elementary School, there's also an additional language-based classroom.

272
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:47,087
[SPEAKER_14]: All of these increases were based clearly on student need and population.

273
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:49,509
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you so very much.

274
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

275
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:55,622
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau, do you have a question?

276
00:30:55,842 --> 00:30:56,483
[SPEAKER_08]: I do, yes.

277
00:30:58,704 --> 00:31:02,167
[SPEAKER_08]: I really love this enrollments document a lot.

278
00:31:02,347 --> 00:31:03,688
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the layout.

279
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,649
[SPEAKER_08]: It's new this year and I appreciate it.

280
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:10,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, thank you, Kim.

281
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:16,297
[SPEAKER_08]: We did also get another, there were several enrollment sheets in the past.

282
00:31:17,318 --> 00:31:18,939
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the ones I did like was,

283
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:24,853
[SPEAKER_08]: a per school, per a teacher's name and grade and how many students were in that class.

284
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:34,759
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be helpful if you could, you know, I mean, I'm sure you have that data already, so I don't, thank you.

285
00:31:37,341 --> 00:31:38,642
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I have one more question.

286
00:31:39,722 --> 00:31:46,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this, looking at the middle school enrollment, are we actually in year one where all students have gone through the lottery now?

287
00:31:47,087 --> 00:31:47,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

288
00:31:47,887 --> 00:31:49,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Good, excellent, thank you.

289
00:31:52,782 --> 00:31:54,623
[SPEAKER_15]: All set, thank you, can continue.

290
00:31:57,644 --> 00:31:58,084
[SPEAKER_15]: All set?

291
00:31:58,364 --> 00:31:59,605
[SPEAKER_04]: We're good, thank you very much.

292
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:04,827
[SPEAKER_15]: We have number two, yes, member Van der Kloot.

293
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:11,369
[SPEAKER_15]: We are, number four, okay.

294
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:21,613
[SPEAKER_15]: So number two, public health update, director of health services and assistant superintendent of finance operations report on student and staff testing program, vaccination clinics,

295
00:32:22,184 --> 00:32:28,603
[SPEAKER_15]: state and district mask mandates and physical distancing protocols, including during meal periods.

296
00:32:29,065 --> 00:32:29,466
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Murphy.

297
00:32:30,055 --> 00:32:31,655
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, mayor, members of the school committee.

298
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:35,336
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be with you once again, and hope you all had a wonderful summer.

299
00:32:36,156 --> 00:32:38,117
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you that we haven't spoken with.

300
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:42,758
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm joined tonight by Avery Hines, our new director of health services.

301
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:43,538
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

302
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:49,359
[SPEAKER_00]: Hines is a five-year veteran of Medford Public Schools, and as you know, is filling some large shoes.

303
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:52,059
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say that even if I didn't see that Ms.

304
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:52,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray was watching.

305
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:58,061
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're certainly, it's an honor to have her here with us and as a member of the team.

306
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:06,104
[SPEAKER_00]: As I think you know the school committee typically takes a vote to confirm the health services officer for the district.

307
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:11,807
[SPEAKER_00]: The superintendent who of course could not be here this evening would like to formally introduce Ms.

308
00:33:11,827 --> 00:33:15,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Hines at the next available opportunity and so we're going to ask you to hold off on that vote.

309
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:16,950
[SPEAKER_00]: until that time.

310
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,751
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, Ms.

311
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:23,354
[SPEAKER_00]: Hines and her team have picked up right where Ms.

312
00:33:23,394 --> 00:33:32,279
[SPEAKER_00]: Ray left off in terms of helping to lead the district through a very difficult period and make sure that we're meeting all of our public health obligations as well as our educational responsibilities.

313
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,362
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she's gonna share some of the data that we have for you tonight.

314
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:44,186
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll be happy to walk through some of the logistical and operational challenges that we are currently meeting during this latest phase of the pandemic.

315
00:33:44,246 --> 00:33:44,467
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ms.

316
00:33:44,847 --> 00:33:45,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Hines.

317
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:50,818
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the introduction and good evening, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

318
00:33:50,838 --> 00:33:51,859
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm very happy to be here.

319
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:59,906
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think it's any surprise to you all that the positive number of cases in Medford is rising and it has been since June.

320
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:04,230
[SPEAKER_12]: In June, there were only 25 cases throughout the city for the whole month.

321
00:34:04,591 --> 00:34:08,334
[SPEAKER_12]: In July, we saw an increase to 123 positive individuals.

322
00:34:08,894 --> 00:34:11,777
[SPEAKER_12]: And then in August, it increased even more to 277 positive cases.

323
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,143
[SPEAKER_12]: So far in the first 12 days of September, there have been 125 positive cases.

324
00:34:20,303 --> 00:34:23,705
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're looking at even more of an increase by the end of September.

325
00:34:25,426 --> 00:34:36,073
[SPEAKER_12]: The Medford Public Schools started its COVID-19 testing program on August 26th and 27th for members of our high school athletic teams and those that participate in extracurricular activities.

326
00:34:36,894 --> 00:34:43,418
[SPEAKER_12]: We tested 307 individuals with PCR testing, and in that we found one positive individual.

327
00:34:44,763 --> 00:35:00,144
[SPEAKER_12]: On August 30 and August 31, the Bedford public school nurses administered 492 tests to staff throughout the district as they're welcome back present, and we were able to identify one positive individual prior to school starting with our students in our buildings.

328
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:07,457
[SPEAKER_12]: Our student surveilling testing resumed this year on September 9th, where 3,301 tests were performed.

329
00:35:08,298 --> 00:35:17,145
[SPEAKER_12]: Of those tests, three positive individuals were identified, and them and their families were contacted by school nurses and contact tracing was completed in a timely manner.

330
00:35:18,278 --> 00:35:30,643
[SPEAKER_12]: Outside of our scheduled surveillance testing, the Medford Public School nurses are working diligently to ensure symptomatic students that present to the health office get both a rapid Binax test as well as an individual PCR test prior to their dismissal.

331
00:35:31,323 --> 00:35:42,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Between September 8th and September 10th, 16 symptomatic students were tested by the school nurses, and we were able to identify four positive students within 15 minutes of them showing up to the health office.

332
00:35:43,263 --> 00:35:56,804
[SPEAKER_12]: This means that school nurses were able to identify and begin contact tracing before the end of the school day, which I think we can all agree is very useful and helpful and hopefully it gets our students the tests that they need and they can monitor for symptoms faster.

333
00:35:58,478 --> 00:36:05,882
[SPEAKER_12]: Parents and guardians have also been proactively alerting the building-based school nurses of positive test results that they received outside of our school testing program.

334
00:36:06,603 --> 00:36:15,568
[SPEAKER_12]: During the week of September 8th and September 10th, there were four students that had tested positive outside of school testing that we were made aware of and were able to contact TRES4.

335
00:36:16,838 --> 00:36:22,281
[SPEAKER_12]: Through the first few weeks of school, the Health Services Department has noted that students are coming to school with illness symptoms.

336
00:36:23,082 --> 00:36:29,386
[SPEAKER_12]: As we all know, even if you are vaccinated, if you're showing symptoms, you should immediately start quarantining and get tested.

337
00:36:30,686 --> 00:36:37,551
[SPEAKER_12]: As a school community, we must continue to be vigilant in our masking, physical distancing, and hand washing to keep everyone safe and in school.

338
00:36:38,011 --> 00:36:38,291
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

339
00:36:40,638 --> 00:36:40,978
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Ms.

340
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:41,518
[SPEAKER_00]: Saenz.

341
00:36:41,698 --> 00:36:52,442
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, we've been attempting to communicate to the committee throughout the course of the last several weeks as we've experienced some modest adjustments in the various operational protocols that we're following.

342
00:36:53,203 --> 00:36:55,804
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to answer whatever questions the committee might have.

343
00:36:56,484 --> 00:37:04,227
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the high-level headlines that I know the committee is familiar with are on the screen now with respect to our quarantine and isolation protocols.

344
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:13,046
[SPEAKER_00]: And besides can certainly elaborate upon this if anyone has any questions but the short version is that they're the biggest distinction between last year, and this year.

345
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:22,276
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest distinction between last year and this year is that those who are vaccinated have a different set of protocols than those who are not vaccinated.

346
00:37:22,656 --> 00:37:30,682
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, for most organizations and most employers, that really sort of dictates the terms by which they are operating.

347
00:37:31,162 --> 00:37:41,270
[SPEAKER_00]: For a school system, because of the age eligibility of the vaccine, there's a large swath of the population of individuals that we are interacting with who we know are going to have to follow the

348
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:45,015
[SPEAKER_00]: old protocols or the earlier protocols because they're not vaccinated.

349
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:50,682
[SPEAKER_00]: So, everything that we've sent out has tried to message that appropriately and draw that distinction.

350
00:37:51,664 --> 00:37:56,650
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important frankly for families and staff to understand that distinction and we'll continue to echo that.

351
00:37:57,331 --> 00:38:07,679
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to physical distancing and mask requirements, the mask mandate at this point is mandated by the commissioner and so it's not a local mandate.

352
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,222
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a mandate from the superintendent as well.

353
00:38:10,662 --> 00:38:16,106
[SPEAKER_00]: That mandate from the superintendent will extend beyond the, at least beyond the October 1st deadline.

354
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:19,189
[SPEAKER_00]: How long it extends, we don't know.

355
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:33,360
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that we're not being asked frequently, but we don't know the answer to that and all I can say right now is that we'll continue to follow the data and fulfill all of the various obligations we will have in the event we institute a change in practice with respect to masking.

356
00:38:33,801 --> 00:38:39,886
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to distancing, we are attempting to maximize physical distancing as much as possible.

357
00:38:40,346 --> 00:38:41,907
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true amongst staff and students.

358
00:38:42,828 --> 00:38:57,537
[SPEAKER_00]: When we learn of instances in which folks are not distancing in a way that is consistent with that we are communicating that appropriately to try to instill the prioritization of distancing, where that's most.

359
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:01,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming into play from an operational perspective is with regard to meal periods.

360
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:08,543
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially all schools have modified their lunch practices in one way or another.

361
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:15,407
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have, as we did last year, some infrastructure obstacles at certain buildings and that

362
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:30,342
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the case that lunch is identical across the district in every building, but what is consistent in every building is that we're maximizing the distance that students are from one another while eating, consistent with public health protocols.

363
00:39:30,943 --> 00:39:37,590
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just the last slide here on some of the operational protocols.

364
00:39:41,724 --> 00:39:49,070
[SPEAKER_00]: We will talk a little bit about the tentative agreements that we've entered into agreements now that we've entered into with our bargaining partners.

365
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:54,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of that is the expectation that we will be hosting additional vaccine clinics.

366
00:39:55,055 --> 00:40:08,586
[SPEAKER_00]: We extend our gratitude to the Board of Health and to the city for the August 26th vaccination clinic that was put on and that we're gonna hope to drum up additional interest amongst students and staff

367
00:40:09,406 --> 00:40:16,728
[SPEAKER_00]: for the additional vaccination clinics that we will either partner with the city or the Department of Education within the coming weeks and months.

368
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,628
[SPEAKER_00]: I put the bullet here with regard to communications.

369
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:26,230
[SPEAKER_00]: As Miss Hein said, we've had a number of positives in different school communities over the course of the last week.

370
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:34,592
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think and we have begun internally deliberating over what is the best practice with respect to COVID related communications.

371
00:40:35,232 --> 00:40:35,592
[SPEAKER_00]: We have

372
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:49,018
[SPEAKER_00]: Developed early on in the 2021 school year, a form letter that I'm sure every parent in the medical public schools is now familiar with, because every school has has received them at one point or another.

373
00:40:50,139 --> 00:40:53,262
[SPEAKER_00]: The frequency and the volume of those letters going out.

374
00:40:53,883 --> 00:41:15,759
[SPEAKER_00]: I do think is calling into question the effectiveness of the communication and that was an issue that we wanted to raise with the committee tonight, and just essentially put the community on notice that we are internally deliberating as to whether or not we can improve upon that practice to continue to keep the community informed, have the information readily available and accessible, but not run the risk

375
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:26,484
[SPEAKER_00]: that some might say we're already running, which is that the letters become such a sort of pro forma affair that they're losing their effectiveness and their value.

376
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:32,707
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that we're now beyond one year from issuing these letters every time there's a positive.

377
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:35,448
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, there's very little information included in them.

378
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:41,451
[SPEAKER_00]: They're essentially building community on notice that there was a positive and that contact tracing has been completed.

379
00:41:42,031 --> 00:41:45,813
[SPEAKER_00]: And that if you are have not been contacted, there's nothing for you to do.

380
00:41:47,453 --> 00:41:50,515
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not changing that practice right now the letters will continue to issue.

381
00:41:51,215 --> 00:41:58,318
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think we need to flag this as there's going to come a point in time where we need to send a letter out and we need everyone to read it closely.

382
00:41:58,898 --> 00:42:01,239
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we continue to issue these letters on a weekly basis.

383
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,441
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that that's gonna be the case.

384
00:42:04,661 --> 00:42:10,546
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can sort of put a pin in that for the time being, but I do think it's something that we'll have to discuss in the near future.

385
00:42:11,426 --> 00:42:14,969
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, just a few other steps that we've taken as part of our layered approach.

386
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:20,193
[SPEAKER_00]: We have used ESSER funding to staff additional nursing positions.

387
00:42:21,514 --> 00:42:29,740
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a clear necessity over the course of the summer when some of the partnerships that we were able to avail ourselves in the previous school year

388
00:42:30,941 --> 00:42:34,782
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not going to yield as much personnel as they have previously.

389
00:42:35,443 --> 00:42:38,164
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we still value the partnerships, we need people.

390
00:42:38,644 --> 00:42:53,509
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you follow the adage that there's never enough nurses, we have sort of subscribed to that in this point in time and added to the health services department in order to make sure that the testing program can continue to function and that Ms.

391
00:42:53,709 --> 00:42:55,310
[SPEAKER_00]: Hines' staff has the support that they need.

392
00:42:57,072 --> 00:43:04,449
[SPEAKER_00]: That's public health for right now, but we're happy to take some questions and before we move on to public health related labor information.

393
00:43:05,832 --> 00:43:06,494
[SPEAKER_15]: Member van de Kloot.

394
00:43:21,438 --> 00:43:24,459
[SPEAKER_07]: What are we doing to support that students academics.

395
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:34,465
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I understand we have our limits, but it seems like now you know they're out for five days they're out for seven days, what if it's a second grader, what do we do.

396
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:49,996
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an excellent question and one that we have, we've been addressing on an individual, and when I say individual, I don't mean individual student, but at an episode by episode basis.

397
00:43:50,656 --> 00:44:01,961
[SPEAKER_00]: And so within the last several weeks, we have had instances in which there was a positive in a school and a definitive number of close contacts identified.

398
00:44:02,713 --> 00:44:05,795
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a sub part of a class.

399
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:22,025
[SPEAKER_00]: In that instance, those close contacts were treated similar to how students would have been treated in the pre-COVID time when students were going to be absent for a significant number of days.

400
00:44:23,908 --> 00:44:27,069
[SPEAKER_00]: but beyond a substantial number of days, if that distinction could be made.

401
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:51,057
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had other instances in which, and the reason that that was the case is because when, and I don't wanna really be tied to very specific numbers here, because it really does have to be on a case-by-case basis, but in a situation in which three or four students have to quarantine, it would potentially be detrimental to the entire class to take

402
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:56,016
[SPEAKER_00]: what would be considered more of a drastic response.

403
00:44:56,777 --> 00:45:04,107
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, simulcasting the class and doing the instruction concurrently so that the students who are remote can follow along.

404
00:45:04,927 --> 00:45:11,591
[SPEAKER_00]: we would be running the risk of diminishing the instructional impact, both for the students who are at home and for the students who are in person.

405
00:45:12,392 --> 00:45:19,696
[SPEAKER_00]: There was another situation in which the number of close contacts essentially amounted to an entire class full of students.

406
00:45:20,496 --> 00:45:30,743
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that instance, because there was going to be no benefit to having the entire class home, the class was permitted to function remotely

407
00:45:31,403 --> 00:45:34,704
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happened to be a very, a class of very younger students.

408
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:36,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was a modified schedule.

409
00:45:36,705 --> 00:45:40,906
[SPEAKER_00]: I should add that that's another way instance of sort of having to do it on a case by case basis.

410
00:45:41,646 --> 00:45:53,730
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is our hope that as the data improves, we will be able to continue to address these situations on a case by case basis in a way that serves the needs of both the students who are

411
00:45:54,752 --> 00:46:10,221
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be home for a period of time and students who are coming in, in some cases for the first time in 18 months and need the sort of full impact of a teacher who is concentrated in that moment on the students who are physically present.

412
00:46:10,682 --> 00:46:21,548
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that if the situation deteriorates and this starts to happen with greater frequency, that may be something that we have to adjust to ensure that we're not

413
00:46:26,315 --> 00:46:29,397
[SPEAKER_00]: having a additional detrimental impact that we that we're trying to avoid.

414
00:46:29,417 --> 00:46:39,822
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, obviously, you would understand my concern for a student who's come back to school and then all of a sudden is out and might be out again a few weeks later and a few weeks later.

415
00:46:40,002 --> 00:46:51,028
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, I think that, you know, I know we've brought in some support people, I think we sometimes may need more, maybe as tutors for students who are out and so I

416
00:46:51,928 --> 00:46:57,130
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that I think we need to very closely monitor, and I'm most concerned about.

417
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,491
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we share the concerns, Ms.

418
00:46:59,511 --> 00:47:00,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Van der Kloot, and I think you're right.

419
00:47:00,591 --> 00:47:02,552
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's something that we'll have to revisit periodically.

420
00:47:04,212 --> 00:47:17,297
[SPEAKER_00]: As you know, a lot of the strategic priorities that we've put forth with regard to our ESSA funding have to do with extended school day programs, supplemental support, and making sure that we're meeting students' needs as much as possible coming out of this difficult period.

421
00:47:18,092 --> 00:47:20,334
[SPEAKER_00]: The one of the challenges and I don't mean to be.

422
00:47:21,895 --> 00:47:33,724
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not pessimistic so I don't want to sound pessimistic, but one of the concerns that I have going forward as we try to develop these strategies is we are facing a multifaceted labor challenge and shortage.

423
00:47:34,344 --> 00:47:42,550
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think you're right, we're going to have to look at how can we staff, and how can we invest as much as possible to make sure that the supports are being provided.

424
00:47:43,051 --> 00:47:45,212
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we're going to have to do so creatively.

425
00:47:45,773 --> 00:47:51,157
[SPEAKER_00]: And to the point that was made earlier about the exhaustion that that we know the entire organization is feeling.

426
00:47:52,738 --> 00:47:56,801
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be realistic about how much help there is in the offing.

427
00:47:57,221 --> 00:48:12,193
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we're going to have to look closely at how do we maximize in there, I'm sure there are people listening to say that we already have, how do we maximize the human capital that we have at our disposal now to try to address some of these needs.

428
00:48:12,753 --> 00:48:15,515
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, I don't think there's a core of tutors, we can hire.

429
00:48:15,975 --> 00:48:22,960
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to have to be looking at our current staff and see how can we invest in that in that talent to provide the services that are necessary.

430
00:48:23,981 --> 00:48:27,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I have other questions but I'll yield to my colleagues, they can get an opportunity.

431
00:48:28,204 --> 00:48:30,065
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, man.

432
00:48:32,507 --> 00:48:36,770
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, if we could do this member McLaughlin if we could mark member McLaughlin present.

433
00:48:37,471 --> 00:48:37,711
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

434
00:48:38,871 --> 00:48:39,272
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

435
00:48:40,506 --> 00:48:41,087
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, ma'am.

436
00:48:42,388 --> 00:48:47,412
[SPEAKER_11]: I was also just wanting to mention, thank you to the chair, thank you to my colleague.

437
00:48:47,972 --> 00:49:03,345
[SPEAKER_11]: I also wanted to mention, I know that we're, as we're thinking of remote instruction or whether there's an opportunity for remote instruction, clearly we have medically fragile students who are unable to attend school at this point with the variant.

438
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:03,786
[SPEAKER_11]: And so,

439
00:49:04,926 --> 00:49:11,389
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to just, for the public's sake, let folks know how we're addressing that need right now, please.

440
00:49:11,409 --> 00:49:17,132
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't quite catch that question.

441
00:49:17,372 --> 00:49:24,275
[SPEAKER_15]: The question was, because of the Delta variant, medically fragile students, how are we addressing that virtually?

442
00:49:24,715 --> 00:49:26,016
[SPEAKER_15]: How are we addressing it virtually?

443
00:49:28,754 --> 00:49:29,234
[SPEAKER_15]: Miss Bowen.

444
00:49:29,755 --> 00:49:45,792
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the ways that we're addressing it is through home and hospital instruction, we would have a medical documentation, we would meet as a team to determine what the student can access and create an out of the box program for that particular student.

445
00:49:47,374 --> 00:49:50,896
[SPEAKER_10]: We have several students right now that we're working on this.

446
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:56,861
[SPEAKER_10]: We may have, if the parents allow it, is staff members who are vaccinated to go into the home.

447
00:49:57,581 --> 00:50:09,210
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a lot of conversations that are going on with specific families to determine how we could provide these services, as well as, you know, how much a student can tolerate if they are medically fragile.

448
00:50:10,335 --> 00:50:17,725
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, and I just would I would just would follow up with that that I know that we're all talking about the social emotional needs of our students right now and understandably so.

449
00:50:18,457 --> 00:50:24,060
[SPEAKER_11]: And I just think about the isolation for those students, especially if they're not able to participate in a classroom setting or with peers.

450
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:41,689
[SPEAKER_11]: So as we're thinking of these, after school, before school, other aspects of social emotional support for our children, I want us to be thinking about how we're including students that we wouldn't necessarily otherwise automatically think of.

451
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:56,382
[SPEAKER_10]: That is definitely a focus that we have going forward when, when discussing these individual student needs, social emotional is for all students, and we will try to have them access as much as possible.

452
00:50:59,665 --> 00:50:59,945
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

453
00:51:04,905 --> 00:51:05,285
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

454
00:51:06,967 --> 00:51:10,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there's a lot of logistical things to work out.

455
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:19,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I've just heard some, a couple of families reporting that their students are still in line when lunch period ends and they don't get to eat.

456
00:51:19,417 --> 00:51:21,920
[SPEAKER_08]: They're not allowed to just, it's not like voting.

457
00:51:23,941 --> 00:51:30,587
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just, I'm not sure what we can do about it, but I do feel a bit like if you're in line to eat,

458
00:51:31,447 --> 00:51:40,178
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't matter what your next period is should be or maybe we allow kids to bring food around the building and, God forbid, the mess, they should be allowed to eat.

459
00:51:40,558 --> 00:51:45,484
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I, the expectation is that it will be treated like voting in the sun, and we'll do it now.

460
00:51:46,025 --> 00:51:47,366
[SPEAKER_00]: I should preface this by saying.

461
00:51:48,407 --> 00:51:51,129
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adjusting the logistics of testing in each building.

462
00:51:51,609 --> 00:52:05,116
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we've had only one day of testing in most buildings, so far, and there are revisions taking place as there was last year after the first couple of days of testing so I know most of the logistical challenges.

463
00:52:07,198 --> 00:52:10,980
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fair to say most of the logistical challenges were concentrated at the high school.

464
00:52:12,161 --> 00:52:18,885
[SPEAKER_00]: That testing routine has been completely revamped as of this morning, and other revisions will take place at other buildings throughout the week.

465
00:52:18,965 --> 00:52:24,048
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any, it should be very clear, every student is entitled to lunch.

466
00:52:26,529 --> 00:52:31,392
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the same as voting, absent some of the statutory and constitutional rights implicated.

467
00:52:31,752 --> 00:52:36,035
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll make sure that that message is circulated appropriately.

468
00:52:36,584 --> 00:52:36,904
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

469
00:52:37,004 --> 00:52:39,606
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I have one other question around.

470
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:49,853
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the school committee members were able to do a tour recently, which was wonderful and greatly appreciated.

471
00:52:50,754 --> 00:53:06,164
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know about all the buildings, but the buildings that I visited, the Missittook and the Andrews, the temperature in much of the building was quite surprising, especially since it wasn't even a terribly hot out or hot out the day before.

472
00:53:08,698 --> 00:53:14,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you just clarify that, well, first of all, that temperature and air changes per hour are completely unrelated?

473
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:15,719
[SPEAKER_00]: That is correct.

474
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:16,660
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thank you.

475
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Just from a COVID safety perspective.

476
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:24,442
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure that the air engineers that we spent a lot of time with last fall would use the term completely unrelated, but they are distinct.

477
00:53:24,982 --> 00:53:31,204
[SPEAKER_00]: And the air change per hour rate, which is how we measured the heightened air quality standards, is distinct from the actual temperature.

478
00:53:31,264 --> 00:53:32,104
[SPEAKER_00]: That part is definitely true.

479
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:33,003
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

480
00:53:33,123 --> 00:53:43,647
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'm sure your offices working on a plan around the temperatures, they were kind of staggering, really, for our brief visit in some of these rooms.

481
00:53:44,708 --> 00:53:46,769
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't really imagine teaching in them, let alone.

482
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:54,432
[SPEAKER_08]: And and so I'm, I know that from our tour, which you are on with me and.

483
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,060
[SPEAKER_08]: member Graham, that some of this is quite a substantial expense.

484
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:01,960
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm.

485
00:54:02,761 --> 00:54:17,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have the resources, whether it's extra funds or whatever or do you need to come to us for resources and other other things such as supply chain problems that will actually get in the way because, you know, the cool seasons coming.

486
00:54:19,405 --> 00:54:20,586
[SPEAKER_08]: But so is June.

487
00:54:20,606 --> 00:54:23,666
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a fair question.

488
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:30,488
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were some areas of the buildings that we toured that were warmer than we would prefer.

489
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:37,890
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sort of different tiers of challenges that we're facing related to our air conditioning.

490
00:54:38,990 --> 00:54:45,412
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some that have been addressed even since our visit last week.

491
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:53,795
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are some that are going to take a significant amount of investment that I will be briefing the committee on in the coming months there.

492
00:54:54,215 --> 00:55:03,160
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the, there'll be some sort of traditional capital infrastructure projects that will will need to identify as priority so.

493
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:11,987
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak to whether we have the resources because we'll have to come back to the committee to discuss with you how all of those priorities fit together.

494
00:55:12,808 --> 00:55:21,775
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that there's some technology related infrastructure priorities that you'll hear about before you'll hear about air conditioning, and I would anticipate that happening at your next meeting.

495
00:55:23,857 --> 00:55:27,099
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to the air conditioning, I'll just say to the mistake in the Andrews.

496
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:32,083
[SPEAKER_00]: The Andrews has had two problems, one of which is my understanding has been addressed.

497
00:55:32,944 --> 00:55:44,232
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the air conditioning on the third floor, and a another problem in the gymnasium that has not been addressed and will not be addressed until we discussed with the committee that the capital improvement priorities so.

498
00:55:45,673 --> 00:55:50,535
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if the third floor at the Andrews is still as hot as it was that day, I'm not aware of that.

499
00:55:50,815 --> 00:55:53,956
[SPEAKER_00]: I suspect now that I've said this publicly, I will be made aware of it quickly if that's the case.

500
00:55:54,656 --> 00:55:56,277
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's my understanding that that's been addressed.

501
00:55:57,057 --> 00:56:00,519
[SPEAKER_00]: The gymnasium is a longer term project that we will need to discuss.

502
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:07,101
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is my hope that we'll be able to resolve that prior to the spring and the next warm season.

503
00:56:07,626 --> 00:56:08,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

504
00:56:08,086 --> 00:56:12,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Well I was the message that I heard from today that it was, I didn't say that quite hot.

505
00:56:13,087 --> 00:56:30,991
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah, I think the message is sort of a mix, frankly, and it's a little more complicated there but thank you to the chair the Andrews technicians were in the Andrews on Friday, and it was serviced and working correctly after after that message I'm not sure.

506
00:56:33,448 --> 00:56:42,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I just want to say I'm really glad that the high school testing is being revamped because that was one of my concerns after our visitation so that's good news.

507
00:56:43,658 --> 00:56:55,731
[SPEAKER_07]: The other question I was just curious about is whether it may be too soon, but I'd like to know if what percentage of our, and I'll ask it as high school students but of our high school students are vaccinated do we know at this point.

508
00:56:57,285 --> 00:57:00,707
[SPEAKER_12]: At this time, we don't have an exact percent to be able to give you that.

509
00:57:00,727 --> 00:57:02,329
[SPEAKER_12]: It would take a lot of time looking in.

510
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:13,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, we've just been relying on parents and students to give us their vaccine cards, which I don't know if you've ever met a high schooler, but it's not always easy to get them to come to the health office during the day and hand you something.

511
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:26,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Sometimes there's things lost in translation, but that is something that once the logistics of COVID testing get ironed out and we're in a more stable place to start doing some of these things, that's something that we would like to look at and get that number out to you guys for.

512
00:57:27,046 --> 00:57:30,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mayor quick follow up on that member result.

513
00:57:30,688 --> 00:57:30,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

514
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:42,515
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it I mean I think I've been hearing in other districts that the state's database of who's vaccinated is used to just generate this information without us dealing with pieces of paper and photocopies.

515
00:57:43,315 --> 00:57:49,139
[SPEAKER_00]: We have access to the data but in reference to the staffing challenges that we alluded to earlier.

516
00:57:50,370 --> 00:58:02,079
[SPEAKER_00]: where we have not allocated the staffing resources necessary to actually collect that data, in part because we're still in the process of actively encouraging people to get vaccinated.

517
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are collecting the data, we're just doing it at a slower pace.

518
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:13,668
[SPEAKER_00]: But before the end of this month, I anticipate we'll be able to report on what our vaccination rate is amongst both the student population and staff.

519
00:58:14,248 --> 00:58:14,488
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

520
00:58:14,588 --> 00:58:18,412
[SPEAKER_08]: And that report will be based on the database from the state, not on.

521
00:58:19,213 --> 00:58:22,476
[SPEAKER_08]: There's just been too many news stories about fake vaccination cards.

522
00:58:23,237 --> 00:58:29,783
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want anybody to believe that it can be verified through the board health, right?

523
00:58:31,604 --> 00:58:37,290
[SPEAKER_15]: And just so you know, Miss Hines and Mr. Murphy, the city is doing two vaccination clinics

524
00:58:37,999 --> 00:58:49,223
[SPEAKER_15]: This Thursday the 16th and Thursday the 23rd at the farmers market three to seven so you may want to push that out to all staff can talk to the Board of Health and Steve our communications.

525
00:58:50,624 --> 00:58:53,385
[SPEAKER_15]: COVID communications professional.

526
00:58:54,085 --> 00:58:54,465
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

527
00:58:54,685 --> 00:58:56,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, cover that term of the contract.

528
00:58:57,931 --> 00:58:59,612
[SPEAKER_15]: Number three, labor relations.

529
00:58:59,832 --> 00:59:00,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

530
00:59:00,153 --> 00:59:01,573
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, sorry.

531
00:59:01,653 --> 00:59:03,335
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't you have to call Yeah, I can't see.

532
00:59:03,715 --> 00:59:04,255
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, okay.

533
00:59:04,555 --> 00:59:06,176
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Graham, the Democrats.

534
00:59:06,556 --> 00:59:22,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I think my question was just whether the Board of Health had stats that they could provide us for the 12 plus population across the city, which is obviously bigger than our school population, but I am interested in what our 12 plus population looks like right now.

535
00:59:22,306 --> 00:59:25,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if the Board of Health has or can report on those numbers for us.

536
00:59:26,018 --> 00:59:34,643
[SPEAKER_15]: We can the last I heard it was like 47% of middle schoolers and a little bit higher for high schoolers, but we can get them more recent update from hopefully the next meeting.

537
00:59:39,045 --> 00:59:44,028
[SPEAKER_15]: In the 50 percentile for high school if if that's my that's my recollection, yes.

538
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:45,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Kreatz.

539
00:59:46,101 --> 00:59:46,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

540
00:59:46,801 --> 00:59:47,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

541
00:59:47,362 --> 00:59:48,362
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have one question.

542
00:59:48,743 --> 00:59:50,604
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's in regards to the high school.

543
00:59:51,445 --> 00:59:56,989
[SPEAKER_13]: So how many students are allowed like in the restrooms, the bathrooms at one time?

544
00:59:57,450 --> 00:59:58,631
[SPEAKER_13]: Did the number increase?

545
00:59:58,831 --> 00:59:59,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it one?

546
00:59:59,732 --> 01:00:00,713
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it more than one?

547
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,396
[SPEAKER_00]: It varies by size, but not more than two.

548
01:00:03,997 --> 01:00:04,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

549
01:00:04,297 --> 01:00:09,182
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some larger restrooms that two are permitted, but if it's a smaller one, it's one.

550
01:00:09,282 --> 01:00:10,463
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true across the district.

551
01:00:11,464 --> 01:00:15,148
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't believe there are any restrooms that, based on size, we've permitted more than two.

552
01:00:16,429 --> 01:00:17,650
[SPEAKER_13]: So no more than two?

553
01:00:18,131 --> 01:00:20,233
[SPEAKER_00]: No more than two in any restroom across the district right now.

554
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:25,973
[SPEAKER_13]: But some restrooms might be a little bit larger, so they- The larger ones, two are permitted.

555
01:00:26,433 --> 01:00:27,434
[SPEAKER_00]: The smaller ones, only one.

556
01:00:27,934 --> 01:00:28,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

557
01:00:29,435 --> 01:00:29,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor?

558
01:00:30,176 --> 01:00:32,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you all set, member Kreatz?

559
01:00:32,657 --> 01:00:33,918
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just had another question.

560
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:48,188
[SPEAKER_13]: So if a student is going to school and they just forgot their mask, do they get asked before they go in the building or do they go through the building and somebody sees them and says, oh, do you need your mask?

561
01:00:48,548 --> 01:00:51,150
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just curious, is there any sort of protocol for that?

562
01:00:51,629 --> 01:00:55,550
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're typically their administrators at each entrance in each building.

563
01:00:55,610 --> 01:01:00,552
[SPEAKER_00]: So there shouldn't be anyone walking in without a mask or if they are, they'd be directed to check in with health services to pick one up.

564
01:01:01,112 --> 01:01:01,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

565
01:01:01,592 --> 01:01:04,513
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are definitely this ample supply of extra masks.

566
01:01:05,053 --> 01:01:05,593
[SPEAKER_13]: We still have them.

567
01:01:05,713 --> 01:01:06,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

568
01:01:06,574 --> 01:01:07,334
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

569
01:01:08,254 --> 01:01:09,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, that is definitely true.

570
01:01:10,155 --> 01:01:10,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

571
01:01:11,258 --> 01:01:11,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

572
01:01:11,578 --> 01:01:11,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ms.

573
01:01:12,018 --> 01:01:13,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Stone, then Member Van der Kloot.

574
01:01:13,819 --> 01:01:14,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

575
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:29,206
[SPEAKER_06]: Nurse Avery, could students take a picture of their COVID vaccination card and just email it to your address or the school that, if it's middle school or a high schooler, like what's the best way to get it to you so you know who's vaccinated in our school?

576
01:01:29,506 --> 01:01:30,667
[SPEAKER_06]: Something you can do when she gets home.

577
01:01:31,711 --> 01:01:36,312
[SPEAKER_12]: If comfortable emailing it, that is probably the best way to get it to us.

578
01:01:36,332 --> 01:01:41,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it is not as confidential as some people prefer.

579
01:01:41,993 --> 01:01:45,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Paper copy is what's going to be the most confidential, just handing it to us.

580
01:01:45,654 --> 01:01:49,095
[SPEAKER_12]: But middle schoolers lose paper copies all the time.

581
01:01:49,135 --> 01:01:51,515
[SPEAKER_12]: So if a parent wanted to drop it off, we would also allow that.

582
01:01:51,535 --> 01:01:55,776
[SPEAKER_12]: We could get the copy at school in the health services or health office.

583
01:01:56,376 --> 01:02:00,057
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you felt comfortable emailing it, they could email it to me or their building

584
01:02:00,863 --> 01:02:06,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, just as you know, I have two middle schoolers and a high schooler, I'm okay with the vaccine being out there.

585
01:02:06,508 --> 01:02:16,478
[SPEAKER_06]: So if people aren't comfortable, a paper copy sent to the office with the nurse office on the envelope, or take a picture and email it to any school nurse.

586
01:02:17,139 --> 01:02:18,220
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you very much.

587
01:02:19,581 --> 01:02:19,901
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

588
01:02:19,981 --> 01:02:20,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Van der Kloot.

589
01:02:21,454 --> 01:02:42,299
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, just to follow up on member credits question, we had received a letter from a parent expressing concern that there were at least three kids in the bathroom when her daughter walked in periodically so you know I know I know it's tough to monitor at all but you know, I just wanted to your attention yeah the high school.

590
01:02:50,053 --> 01:02:53,595
[SPEAKER_09]: have better monitoring on those situations as they come up.

591
01:02:53,615 --> 01:02:57,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I think we might have all gotten it, but I'll make sure I forward it on to you.

592
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:00,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor?

593
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,320
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau?

594
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:11,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I make a motion to suspend the rules to take item 8.8, number two, out of order?

595
01:03:12,327 --> 01:03:14,328
[SPEAKER_15]: And a motion to suspend the rules, seconded by?

596
01:03:14,348 --> 01:03:15,149
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

597
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:18,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Member McLaughlin, all those in favor?

598
01:03:19,481 --> 01:03:20,562
[SPEAKER_15]: I opposed.

599
01:03:22,082 --> 01:03:39,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to take paper number item number 200 new business pursuant to 603 CMR 50.07 10 two thirds of Medford member school committees must approve collaborative capital improvement plans.

600
01:03:40,491 --> 01:03:44,393
[SPEAKER_15]: The short educational collaborative is seeking the approval of this plan from the members

601
01:03:44,972 --> 01:03:46,632
[SPEAKER_15]: which includes the Medford Public Schools.

602
01:03:47,072 --> 01:03:50,153
[SPEAKER_15]: Member school districts are not being asked to fund this plan.

603
01:03:50,533 --> 01:03:56,214
[SPEAKER_15]: The regulation requires us to approve this so that the Shore Educational Collaborative may implement this plan.

604
01:03:56,674 --> 01:04:07,277
[SPEAKER_15]: See additional documentation titled Shore Educational Collaborative Capital Improvement Plan Fiscal Years 2021-2031 provided for the details of this request.

605
01:04:07,497 --> 01:04:08,537
[SPEAKER_15]: Offered by member Ruseau.

606
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:09,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau.

607
01:04:09,694 --> 01:04:10,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, ma'am.

608
01:04:10,755 --> 01:04:26,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I am the Medford school committee representative on the shore educational collaboratives board of directors and the chairman chairperson excuse me, and our executive director Jackie Clark is here to answer any questions about this plan.

609
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:34,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to assume she is on zoom so I have no idea how to get her on zoom so she can answer questions that we might have.

610
01:04:35,568 --> 01:04:38,890
[SPEAKER_08]: But who's running is Dr. Cushing running this.

611
01:04:39,870 --> 01:04:40,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you see Jackie in there.

612
01:04:45,593 --> 01:04:48,375
[SPEAKER_06]: Member so I mean member of the stone.

613
01:04:49,295 --> 01:04:55,058
[SPEAKER_06]: While we look for the executive director Paul you might know how long has Medford been in partnership with short collaborative.

614
01:04:55,738 --> 01:04:59,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we were founding member, but Jackie will know that off the top of her head.

615
01:05:02,642 --> 01:05:03,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here and unmuted.

616
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:08,693
[SPEAKER_01]: Jackie Clark, the executive director of sure.

617
01:05:08,713 --> 01:05:11,477
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for having me.

618
01:05:12,738 --> 01:05:19,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure was established in the late 70s and and Medford has been a member since then so well over 50 years.

619
01:05:19,746 --> 01:05:22,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

620
01:05:22,629 --> 01:05:24,812
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Member van de gloop.

621
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:34,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, I read the document that member Ruseau provided to us in detail, and as a former representative to with shore.

622
01:05:34,868 --> 01:05:37,672
[SPEAKER_07]: I am very familiar with shore.

623
01:05:38,132 --> 01:05:42,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And in fact, remember, Hank Owen, the director.

624
01:05:43,403 --> 01:05:47,748
[SPEAKER_07]: of many years, very rightly, is a wonderful wonderful person.

625
01:05:49,670 --> 01:06:03,125
[SPEAKER_07]: The question that came to me is that this is basically calling for a fund to be put aside for capital improvements for sure, which makes a great deal of sense, but I didn't see anything addressing

626
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:15,771
[SPEAKER_07]: the potential for, if by any chance, something should happen to the shore such that it would cease to exist, what would happen of the money?

627
01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:24,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And so there was no, I didn't see any line item which suggested that it would be split back between the districts or anything else like that.

628
01:06:24,975 --> 01:06:32,779
[SPEAKER_07]: And while it is perhaps far-fetched to believe something will happen after the successful run of shore, it seemed to me that some

629
01:06:33,459 --> 01:06:40,703
[SPEAKER_07]: some notation should be made about what would happen to that account in the future if it was not used.

630
01:06:43,145 --> 01:06:45,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like me to answer that, Mr. Russo?

631
01:06:45,426 --> 01:06:47,147
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

632
01:06:47,668 --> 01:06:48,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please.

633
01:06:48,528 --> 01:07:00,035
[SPEAKER_01]: As part of our larger establishing agreement, our articles of agreement, there is a whole section devoted to the dissolution.

634
01:07:01,299 --> 01:07:04,900
[SPEAKER_01]: very theoretically, we hope, of shore should have come to that.

635
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:10,562
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe the assets, including this fund, is restricted for capital use.

636
01:07:10,622 --> 01:07:20,986
[SPEAKER_01]: But obviously, if shore were dissolving, it would be an asset is divided sort of pro rata based on the,

637
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:28,936
[SPEAKER_01]: the member district's share of percentage of students and tuitions paid in the previous years.

638
01:07:29,476 --> 01:07:42,848
[SPEAKER_01]: I can certainly, it's on our website, but I can make that available to the committee, our full articles of agreement, but that is accounted for in that document.

639
01:07:44,206 --> 01:07:50,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my suggestion is that simply that should be added to this document.

640
01:07:50,828 --> 01:07:58,091
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I'm happy to refer it to your attorney as to whether that needs to be or not.

641
01:07:58,171 --> 01:07:59,431
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was my one concern.

642
01:08:00,711 --> 01:08:06,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, I would make a motion to support this paper.

643
01:08:06,533 --> 01:08:06,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

644
01:08:06,693 --> 01:08:06,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion.

645
01:08:12,248 --> 01:08:15,610
[SPEAKER_15]: in favor by member Van der Kloot, seconded by member Graham.

646
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:17,971
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor?

647
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:19,312
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

648
01:08:20,132 --> 01:08:21,032
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed?

649
01:08:21,052 --> 01:08:22,053
[SPEAKER_07]: Should it be a roll call?

650
01:08:22,093 --> 01:08:23,034
[SPEAKER_08]: We should call it a roll call.

651
01:08:23,274 --> 01:08:26,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it should be a roll call as regards to finances.

652
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Roll call has been requested by member Van der Kloot.

653
01:08:31,998 --> 01:08:33,219
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

654
01:08:33,559 --> 01:08:33,759

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_11]: Member Kreatz?

657
01:08:36,921 --> 01:08:37,121
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin?

659
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:40,022

[SPEAKER_11]: Member Mustone?

661
01:08:41,403 --> 01:08:41,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

662
01:08:43,002 --> 01:08:43,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau?

663
01:08:44,543 --> 01:08:44,783
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

664
01:08:46,004 --> 01:08:46,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Van der Kloot?

665
01:08:47,546 --> 01:08:47,766
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

666

[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn?

667
01:08:50,688 --> 01:08:50,988
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

668
01:08:51,149 --> 01:08:52,630
[SPEAKER_15]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

669
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:55,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Paper has been passed.

670
01:08:55,112 --> 01:08:55,332
[SPEAKER_08]: Mayor.

671
01:08:55,572 --> 01:08:56,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Great, thank you.

672
01:08:57,053 --> 01:08:57,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

673
01:08:58,454 --> 01:08:59,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Jackie.

674
01:08:59,515 --> 01:09:00,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

675
01:09:00,556 --> 01:09:01,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Jackie.

676
01:09:01,597 --> 01:09:01,877
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

677
01:09:01,937 --> 01:09:02,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau?

678
01:09:03,353 --> 01:09:07,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, motion to revert to the regular order of business to revert to the regular order of business.

679
01:09:07,982 --> 01:09:11,007
[SPEAKER_15]: Second by second member of Scotland.

680
01:09:11,508 --> 01:09:12,149
[SPEAKER_15]: All those in favor.

681
01:09:15,641 --> 01:09:17,162
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to revert has been approved.

682
01:09:17,343 --> 01:09:20,806
[SPEAKER_15]: Number three, labor relations update.

683
01:09:21,166 --> 01:09:33,937
[SPEAKER_15]: Assistant superintendent of finance operations report on tentative agreements reached with various collective bargaining partners regarding mandatory weekly COVID-19 testing and proof of vaccination requirements.

684
01:09:34,358 --> 01:09:34,738
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Murphy.

685
01:09:35,348 --> 01:09:35,828
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mayor.

686
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:44,514
[SPEAKER_00]: As the committee knows, the district did enter into tentative agreements with the majority of our bargaining partners over the course of the last several weeks.

687
01:09:45,335 --> 01:09:57,583
[SPEAKER_00]: As the was noted in the agenda item, the two most substantive and consequential items in those agreements are the obligation to test for COVID-19 on a weekly basis.

688
01:09:58,223 --> 01:10:07,312
[SPEAKER_00]: as part of our free testing program that we have instituted in partnership with Tufts University, as well as an obligation to show proof of vaccination.

689
01:10:10,495 --> 01:10:12,116
[SPEAKER_00]: The obligation to prove vaccination.

690
01:10:12,556 --> 01:10:13,978
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the two core pieces.

691
01:10:14,698 --> 01:10:23,407
[SPEAKER_00]: With some of the units, there are a few additional components, including a health and safety committee, the vaccination clinics that were referenced earlier,

692
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:30,030
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as electronic means of reporting health and safety concerns.

693
01:10:30,791 --> 01:10:38,614
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to say and I said this in my communication to the committee that these agreements really were cultivated.

694
01:10:40,076 --> 01:10:46,543
[SPEAKER_00]: In the, in the sense of a partnership and a constructive dialogue that we had with the bargaining units.

695
01:10:47,605 --> 01:10:54,553
[SPEAKER_00]: We often use the term bargaining partner and I think that sometimes that can sort of become sort of.

696
01:10:56,512 --> 01:11:10,897
[SPEAKER_00]: We can become a lot of things but in this in this instance this really was a true partnership and I want to extend my gratitude to on behalf of the superintendent to all the unit representatives who joined in this discussion, and.

697
01:11:12,457 --> 01:11:16,859
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think these agreements really do serve the interests of students and staff.

698
01:11:16,899 --> 01:11:21,360
[SPEAKER_00]: So these agreements have entered into through the superintendent's signature.

699
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:26,122
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend that the committee take a vote to endorse them.

700
01:11:26,942 --> 01:11:32,003
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially a symbolic vote, but I think it's important to demonstrate the support of the governing body.

701
01:11:32,023 --> 01:11:36,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are obviously any questions related to the agreements, I'd be more than happy to answer them.

702
01:11:37,759 --> 01:11:38,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor?

703
01:11:38,539 --> 01:11:39,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Member van de Kloet.

704
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,861
[SPEAKER_07]: I was asked to inquire about this.

705
01:11:41,941 --> 01:11:50,765
[SPEAKER_07]: So the original date that employees were supposed to give you documentation was September 8th, and then it was put off to the 17th.

706
01:11:51,285 --> 01:11:53,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Could you explain why that happened?

707
01:11:54,286 --> 01:11:55,547
[SPEAKER_00]: The date was September 8th.

708
01:11:55,807 --> 01:11:57,688
[SPEAKER_00]: So as part of the agreements, that is the date.

709
01:11:57,748 --> 01:12:07,572
[SPEAKER_00]: But as is often the case with respect to performance under these agreements, it takes some time to collect this type of documentation from hundreds of people.

710
01:12:07,982 --> 01:12:16,331
[SPEAKER_00]: The parties have been, from a legal perspective, performing under the terms of the agreement in the sense that we've been facilitating the testing program.

711
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:19,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Employees have been participating in the testing program.

712
01:12:20,315 --> 01:12:25,380
[SPEAKER_00]: A large, significant number of employees have already turned in their proof of vaccination.

713
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:34,385
[SPEAKER_00]: There were ratification votes that took place, either, I believe, on the eighth, and so from a maybe the day after the eighth but from a practical perspective.

714
01:12:35,285 --> 01:12:37,367
[SPEAKER_00]: That is why in our communications to staff.

715
01:12:38,147 --> 01:12:40,848
[SPEAKER_00]: We've emphasized a hard deadline of September 17.

716
01:12:41,149 --> 01:12:45,191
[SPEAKER_00]: The reality is, our priority is making sure that we have

717
01:12:45,651 --> 01:12:48,672
[SPEAKER_00]: an accurate accounting of our vaccination status.

718
01:12:49,353 --> 01:12:52,994
[SPEAKER_00]: And that it was always going to take some time.

719
01:12:53,154 --> 01:12:58,677
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really just a question of the sort of a rollout with respect to performance.

720
01:12:59,443 --> 01:13:08,666
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that perhaps the interpretation might have been by some people that it was, oh, people aren't getting their stuff in, so we're giving them extra time, and they're dragging their feet.

721
01:13:08,686 --> 01:13:17,828
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanted to make it clear that, in fact, we are having great cooperation with our labor units.

722
01:13:18,068 --> 01:13:23,950
[SPEAKER_00]: If that was the misinterpretation, I really truly appreciate you pointing this out, because I really can't speak enough.

723
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:30,171
[SPEAKER_00]: of the cooperation and partnership that we've experienced with the bargaining units that we've entered into agreements with.

724
01:13:30,251 --> 01:13:39,414
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think this is sort of a classic example of a shared interest on the part of both union and management.

725
01:13:40,014 --> 01:13:53,737
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my hope that that positive discourse and dialogue continues, because we know that there are many other issues, some of which very much related to those that are addressed in these agreements that we will have to tackle in the coming weeks.

726
01:13:54,200 --> 01:14:05,524
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, well I think we're all very thankful to our labor units and I'd like to make a motion that the school committee endorse the agreements that were set forth around.

727
01:14:07,024 --> 01:14:14,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you say around the mandatory coven 19 testing and proof of vaccination requirements.

728
01:14:15,127 --> 01:14:21,049
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's a fair question for approval a member of and include seconded by member so all those in favor.

729
01:14:23,907 --> 01:14:24,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Paper passes.

730
01:14:24,607 --> 01:14:29,610
[SPEAKER_15]: If there's no further questions, we can go to number four, operations and transportation update.

731
01:14:30,471 --> 01:14:52,643
[SPEAKER_15]: Assistant superintendent for finance operations reports on adjustment to transportation protocols and challenges experienced by families with respect to transportation during the start of school, as well as a pilot program instituted at Medford High School in response to the mandate by the Medford School Committee to increase access and improve equity of transportation

732
01:14:53,295 --> 01:14:56,496
[SPEAKER_15]: options available to Medford high school students, Mr. Murphy.

733
01:14:56,796 --> 01:15:08,921
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mary, as the committee knows the beginning of every school year there are inevitable operational challenges that each school community faces and that's true with or without a pandemic.

734
01:15:09,762 --> 01:15:12,603
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, we've had, I think what would be

735
01:15:13,243 --> 01:15:16,724
[SPEAKER_00]: accurately called a pretty smooth and efficient opening of school.

736
01:15:17,465 --> 01:15:33,791
[SPEAKER_00]: That's certainly thanks in no small part to all of the staff members who have worked tirelessly over the coming weeks to prepare for the arrival of 4,000 students, including a large percentage of whom, as you know, has not been in school doing in-person learning for approximately 17 months.

737
01:15:34,711 --> 01:15:37,292
[SPEAKER_00]: So on behalf of the whole team, I just want to say

738
01:15:37,732 --> 01:15:49,241
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, how grateful we are to the school leaders and to the teachers the paraprofessionals administrative assistants custodians and everyone else who has made this opening of school successful on the operational side.

739
01:15:50,422 --> 01:15:52,604
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to this the general operational update here.

740
01:15:55,126 --> 01:16:12,413
[SPEAKER_00]: tried to systematize and we're continuing to try to systematize the way in which the operational side of the district serves our instructional interest and so you'll see the link to our operational request form that is an internal request form for staff members so that we can inventory catalog

741
01:16:12,893 --> 01:16:16,656
[SPEAKER_00]: and then track our progress in terms of being responsive to the various issues that pop up.

742
01:16:17,277 --> 01:16:20,619
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a high concentration of issues that pop up at the beginning of the school year.

743
01:16:21,020 --> 01:16:21,900
[SPEAKER_00]: That's to be expected.

744
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:29,627
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working our way through them and working closely with school leaders to determine their priorities within each school community.

745
01:16:30,147 --> 01:16:35,451
[SPEAKER_00]: We mentioned earlier the air conditioning challenges that some of the schools are facing.

746
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:37,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all schools are facing some

747
01:16:38,734 --> 01:16:45,101
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge sporadic air conditioning issues but we're continuing to address those as expeditiously as we can.

748
01:16:45,121 --> 01:16:51,407
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some critical infrastructure projects that we're making progress on will be updating the committee on that.

749
01:16:52,728 --> 01:16:57,053
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely next month to give you an update as to where we stand on some of the issues that we've discussed.

750
01:16:57,513 --> 01:16:58,434
[SPEAKER_00]: in this form previously.

751
01:16:58,454 --> 01:17:06,044
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to save transportation for the last for last because I suspect that's where a number of questions might be but with regard to food services.

752
01:17:06,644 --> 01:17:12,291
[SPEAKER_00]: This was referenced in the superintendent's weekly communication on Friday, that even though school lunches free.

753
01:17:12,872 --> 01:17:15,394
[SPEAKER_00]: for the 21-22 school year per the federal government.

754
01:17:16,134 --> 01:17:22,138
[SPEAKER_00]: It is incredibly important that families fill out the free and reduced lunch application.

755
01:17:22,978 --> 01:17:30,483
[SPEAKER_00]: The state and the federal government make a number of determinations based on the percentages and we want to have as accurate data as possible.

756
01:17:31,003 --> 01:17:34,085
[SPEAKER_00]: So that communication has gone out in a few different

757
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:43,566
[SPEAKER_00]: mediums already but we'll continue to be pushing that out at both the district and school level to try to get as much as much as accurate data as possible.

758
01:17:45,786 --> 01:18:10,801
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to just will also be reporting later about some of our engagement efforts through the newly created engagement office, and which we've established as we discussed spring, the engagement hub and we're asking offices to coordinate and have a whole of organization response to the challenges facing students and families who have felt more disconnected from their school communities as a result of the pandemic so

759
01:18:11,561 --> 01:18:11,702
[SPEAKER_00]: Ms.

760
01:18:11,722 --> 01:18:18,550
[SPEAKER_00]: Fidler-Carey will be reporting on that in the coming weeks, but I did just want to say that that staff and that organization are off to a good start.

761
01:18:18,570 --> 01:18:28,021
[SPEAKER_00]: I know some of you had the opportunity to meet at least one of our engagement specialists on the tours last week, and that team is working hard in the various school committees to which they've been deployed.

762
01:18:29,022 --> 01:18:40,728
[SPEAKER_00]: With regard to transportation, and I think in most districts, the person in my role, usually has a bit of reservation in his or her voice when they report on transportation at the beginning of the school year.

763
01:18:42,369 --> 01:18:47,131
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is to some degree the norm, but I do want to stress that it is.

764
01:18:48,492 --> 01:18:59,800
[SPEAKER_00]: It is to the degree families are experiencing challenges, and some of the, the typical obstacles, I was going to say hiccups but I think that would be understating it so I don't, I don't want to do that.

765
01:19:00,501 --> 01:19:04,423
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the obstacles that families have faced over the course of the past couple of weeks.

766
01:19:05,364 --> 01:19:09,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it is true that generally speaking, we've also had a smooth opening with respect to transportation.

767
01:19:09,966 --> 01:19:18,611
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been pockets of challenges and problems that we've been working with our primary bus vendor, Eastern Bus Company, to try to resolve.

768
01:19:19,211 --> 01:19:29,436
[SPEAKER_00]: There have also been a few instances in which students with disabilities who are receiving transportation outside of the primary vendor have experienced challenges that Ms.

769
01:19:29,456 --> 01:19:34,119
[SPEAKER_00]: Bowen and her team have been working to iron out to ensure that those don't continue

770
01:19:34,819 --> 01:19:37,720
[SPEAKER_00]: past don't continue period.

771
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:46,863
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I can talk a little bit about if the committee would like some of the specific changes that we've put in place with respect to organization.

772
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:52,705
[SPEAKER_00]: We've instituted a pilot program at the high school to expand the free transportation options that students have.

773
01:19:53,465 --> 01:19:54,786
[SPEAKER_00]: We have essentially planned for that.

774
01:19:55,946 --> 01:20:03,708
[SPEAKER_00]: for a three-month period in which students living beyond a two-mile radius from the high school will receive an MBTA pass with no charge.

775
01:20:04,228 --> 01:20:17,151
[SPEAKER_00]: That's contrasted to the tradition or the historical discounting of the MBTA passes, and the school committee voted last spring and directed the administration to try to expand those free options.

776
01:20:17,571 --> 01:20:21,032
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to the MBTA program, we've also

777
01:20:22,552 --> 01:20:26,495
[SPEAKER_00]: have doubled the amount of Eastern bus company transportation coming to and from the high school.

778
01:20:27,236 --> 01:20:43,409
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, due to some of the challenges that I was just referencing across the district primarily attributable to the nationwide bus driver shortage that the governor addressed today and the activation of the National Guard, which I think speaks to the extent of the issue.

779
01:20:45,366 --> 01:20:50,934
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to have to curtail the afternoon route out of the high school.

780
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:58,585
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, at the moment, that bus is not particularly well populated, I believe there's a handful of students at most we've been taking it.

781
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:07,290
[SPEAKER_00]: The shortage of drivers was resulting in the bus not leaving the high school until significantly after dismissal time.

782
01:21:07,671 --> 01:21:14,673
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think we really have a sense yet as to how many students would be serviced, if we were running that on the schedule that we would like to.

783
01:21:15,473 --> 01:21:22,799
[SPEAKER_00]: The other structural change that we're in the process of putting in place is reactivating our partnership with the vendor trans finder.

784
01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:31,486
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a data tracking system that many districts use to essentially plot their transportation map.

785
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:35,189
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my understanding that Medford had this partnership in previous years.

786
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:38,912
[SPEAKER_00]: It appears to have expired at some point in the 1920 school year.

787
01:21:40,513 --> 01:22:00,140
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, we are in the process of reactivating that partnership and have communicated to families throughout the start of the school year, that as not in the detail about trans finder but we've communicated that there may be fluctuations in the routes and stops over the course of the next several months there's always a sense of some fluctuation in the first couple of weeks.

788
01:22:01,061 --> 01:22:03,123
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the case over the next week or two.

789
01:22:03,143 --> 01:22:11,172
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to continue to communicate to families as thoroughly as possible so that they are aware of any modest changes that might go into effect.

790
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:34,015
[SPEAKER_00]: My hope is that as we get to the end of the pilot program at the high school, the partnership with Transfinder will yield potential efficiencies that we can then use to reallocate resources and to both expand transportation at the high school, but also ensure more efficiency at the K-8 schools.

791
01:22:34,555 --> 01:22:41,777
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've sort of, through the ESSER funding, budgeted for ourselves a three-month pilot program

792
01:22:42,737 --> 01:22:45,959
[SPEAKER_00]: in response to the direction that the committee gave in the spring.

793
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:56,245
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is our hope to come back to you with a more long-term plan once we're able to sort of see exactly what the Transfinder Partnership might produce.

794
01:22:56,925 --> 01:23:04,449
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that's a lot of information, but there's been a lot going on in the operational side as we've gotten this clear off to what I think is a relatively good start.

795
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:08,592
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd be happy to expand upon any pieces of that if anyone would like me to.

796
01:23:08,612 --> 01:23:10,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

797
01:23:11,845 --> 01:23:12,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau.

798
01:23:13,366 --> 01:23:15,167
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau, then Member McLaughlin.

799
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:17,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mayor.

800
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:23,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Trying to think how to write a word all this.

801
01:23:24,712 --> 01:23:37,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes we have students that don't get specialized transportation, but that's because they can get on the bus and get off at the right stop and be met by a parent or

802
01:23:38,058 --> 01:23:40,058
[SPEAKER_08]: or the stop is right in front of their house or whatever.

803
01:23:40,078 --> 01:23:43,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And that works.

804
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:54,661
[SPEAKER_08]: And I experienced this in middle school where nobody knew where my son was and it happened several times.

805
01:23:55,142 --> 01:24:06,884
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess my question is around, I'm sort of afraid we're gonna end up like taking dozens or a hundred students and saying they need specialized transportation because

806
01:24:08,332 --> 01:24:13,774
[SPEAKER_08]: just getting on the bus and getting off at the right stop, which might move day to day, isn't gonna work.

807
01:24:14,594 --> 01:24:21,576
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, students on IEPs that, I mean, I would never imagine that my son needed to be on a specialized bus.

808
01:24:21,816 --> 01:24:35,480
[SPEAKER_08]: However, if he just gets dropped off at some random other place because of the, because of a shutdown of a road or because of all kinds of other reasons where there's an assumption, he'll just find his way home, he's a high schooler.

809
01:24:37,721 --> 01:24:44,427
[SPEAKER_08]: That can quickly turn into me making it part of his IEP and dramatically jacking up our transportation costs.

810
01:24:44,947 --> 01:24:55,897
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean this was sixth grade he's not it's not really an issue anymore but I'm wondering what is the responsibility when a kid gets on a bus, who's responsible for

811
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,474
[SPEAKER_08]: for knowing where the kid is?

812
01:24:59,734 --> 01:25:04,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it Eastern Bus who's responsible for every child that gets on a bus and where they're supposed to get off?

813
01:25:05,096 --> 01:25:09,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Or is there short of an IEP statement or some kind of specialized transportation?

814
01:25:09,358 --> 01:25:11,519
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know nothing about how that stuff works, forgive me.

815
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:19,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Are all students just, if it's regular transportation, you get on, you get off, not our issue.

816
01:25:19,843 --> 01:25:20,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

817
01:25:20,383 --> 01:25:27,087
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the question is ultimately who is responsible for making sure students get to where

818
01:25:28,383 --> 01:25:29,284
[SPEAKER_00]: they're supposed to be.

819
01:25:30,004 --> 01:25:38,992
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I would say to that is, number one, I don't think the district is ever in a place where we can say, we're not responsible, that's on the vendor.

820
01:25:39,272 --> 01:25:41,354
[SPEAKER_00]: We hired the vendor, we are responsible.

821
01:25:41,414 --> 01:25:48,140
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanna start by saying that the Medford Public Schools is responsible for making sure that students get to the bus stops that they are assigned to.

822
01:25:48,882 --> 01:25:57,347
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one that, and they're assigned to the bus stop that in the case that you raised, where they're familiar with, they know how they're gonna get home.

823
01:25:57,867 --> 01:26:04,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it is not acceptable for a bus to drop a kid off within the boundaries of Medford and say, well, it's a pretty small community.

824
01:26:04,650 --> 01:26:05,231
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll find their way.

825
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:06,611
[SPEAKER_00]: That's completely unacceptable.

826
01:26:07,052 --> 01:26:13,535
[SPEAKER_00]: And when there are instances of that, it is the responsibility of the district to take that issue up with the vendor.

827
01:26:14,155 --> 01:26:16,997
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are isolated incidents where those things happen.

828
01:26:17,567 --> 01:26:18,809
[SPEAKER_00]: And we address that.

829
01:26:20,993 --> 01:26:29,447
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the vendor, practically speaking, obviously they have custody of that student.

830
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,601
[SPEAKER_00]: during that period of time.

831
01:26:33,361 --> 01:26:41,263
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's part of the partnership with the district is they have to perform and perform means get the students there safely.

832
01:26:41,703 --> 01:26:58,669
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things that we tried to do, and I talked about trying to sort of systematize some of the pieces of our operational approach is we had sort of a school by school approach to signing up for a particular bus and identifying the bus stop that you

833
01:27:00,167 --> 01:27:06,573
[SPEAKER_00]: plan to go to and probably a little stricter for younger students and a little looser for the older students.

834
01:27:07,213 --> 01:27:15,180
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that we want to create a system that is so strict that if a high school student is going to his or her friend's house after school, they can't get there.

835
01:27:15,460 --> 01:27:18,243
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not going to work or a job or whatever.

836
01:27:19,444 --> 01:27:37,218
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do, through the system that we've put in place, in which each family has been asked to identify the specific route, and then we intend to match that data with the data that we extract through TransFinder, it is our hope to know at all times exactly where a student is supposed to be.

837
01:27:37,918 --> 01:27:43,823
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that if there comes an issue, at a minimum, we can identify where they went off track.

838
01:27:44,003 --> 01:27:45,384
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that,

839
01:27:48,876 --> 01:27:50,737
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean to respond to each.

840
01:27:51,437 --> 01:27:54,218
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like I've said we have to handle on a case-by-case basis a lot tonight.

841
01:27:54,659 --> 01:28:03,402
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this situation, I think our responsibility is to create a system that reliably gets students to and from school safely and efficiently.

842
01:28:03,842 --> 01:28:10,285
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are specific issues that come up, like a student being dropped off at the wrong stop, we need to address that with the vendor.

843
01:28:10,365 --> 01:28:14,347
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not, I mean, if some time of us, you know, you end up at one corner versus another,

844
01:28:15,938 --> 01:28:24,488
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to happen on occasion, but generally speaking the buses have to follow the routes that the district has sanctioned, and they have to get the kids to the stops that they're, they're signed up for.

845
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:26,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

846
01:28:26,531 --> 01:28:29,915
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just add one little additional comment on that question on this.

847
01:28:33,523 --> 01:28:36,664
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that there was a case where the student was brought back to the middle school.

848
01:28:37,585 --> 01:28:39,925
[SPEAKER_08]: It was today or whatever the day was.

849
01:28:40,706 --> 01:28:48,969
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, the we have in previous years, you know, we've done the wait till eight to get kids to not have cell phones and kindergarten.

850
01:28:50,449 --> 01:28:55,751
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, wait till eight means there's lots of middle schoolers that don't have cell phones.

851
01:28:56,091 --> 01:28:57,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, ideally.

852
01:29:00,297 --> 01:29:11,982
[SPEAKER_08]: By the time a kid is brought back to the school, if they don't have a phone, do we always have staffing for at least an hour or two after school ends?

853
01:29:13,483 --> 01:29:15,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I just wasn't 100% sure, thank you.

854
01:29:17,165 --> 01:29:18,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, member McLaughlin is next.

855
01:29:21,387 --> 01:29:21,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

856
01:29:23,396 --> 01:29:24,357
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a couple of questions.

857
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:33,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy, how many students beyond the two mile or two miles plus are getting MBTA passes you have a number on that yet.

858
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:38,452
[SPEAKER_00]: actually received the passes.

859
01:29:39,841 --> 01:29:45,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I believe 152 were without charge.

860
01:29:46,604 --> 01:29:46,964
[SPEAKER_11]: Excellent.

861
01:29:46,984 --> 01:29:47,404
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

862
01:29:48,485 --> 01:29:59,109
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, um, I just wanted to know because I know that we personally have had some issues with transportation, just at the start of the year and there's a couple of things that we discovered.

863
01:29:59,869 --> 01:30:09,814
[SPEAKER_11]: that I discovered that was sort of surprising to me, and I want to make sure that my colleagues in the community understand is that there's no central dispatch for transportation within the district.

864
01:30:09,914 --> 01:30:23,440
[SPEAKER_11]: So right now, if I understand correctly, for the Eastern bus, the newly hired family and community engagement coordinator is managing the transportation from that standpoint.

865
01:30:23,520 --> 01:30:23,900
[SPEAKER_11]: And for

866
01:30:24,641 --> 01:30:27,666
[SPEAKER_11]: students with disabilities receiving specialized services.

867
01:30:28,287 --> 01:30:32,995
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the special education secretaries are managing dispatch and transportation.

868
01:30:33,055 --> 01:30:33,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that accurate?

869
01:30:35,918 --> 01:30:38,959
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sort of and I can expand upon that a little bit.

870
01:30:38,979 --> 01:30:40,580
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to correct my previous answer.

871
01:30:40,660 --> 01:30:47,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I said 152, but I was I wasn't counting the last day that we were the last day to date that we were passing them out.

872
01:30:47,962 --> 01:30:48,502
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually 230.

873
01:30:48,642 --> 01:30:54,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good about where now I'm just messing up my math 260.

874
01:30:54,905 --> 01:30:56,745
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll be my final answer for tonight.

875
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:56,945
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

876
01:30:57,025 --> 01:30:57,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll take it.

877
01:30:58,626 --> 01:30:58,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

878
01:31:02,007 --> 01:31:02,248
[SPEAKER_00]: 295 passes.

879
01:31:02,268 --> 01:31:03,009
[SPEAKER_00]: 295 total passes, 260 free.

880
01:31:03,029 --> 01:31:07,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like 35 were people that were within two miles but still wanted an MBTA pass.

881
01:31:18,167 --> 01:31:19,988
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is with regard to the dispatch.

882
01:31:20,749 --> 01:31:21,389
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that.

883
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:33,514
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Miss bone can speak to the, to the, the special education, transportation, and how, and that's managed but generally speaking, her offices is responsible for that.

884
01:31:33,974 --> 01:31:42,518
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tries to be as responsive as possible to families and works closely with the various vendors that support our specialized transportation system.

885
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:45,579
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to the eastern bus, our primary vendor.

886
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:51,402
[SPEAKER_00]: It is true that the dispatcher is a eastern bus company employee.

887
01:31:54,448 --> 01:32:03,690
[SPEAKER_00]: up until July, there really wasn't a transportation liaison with that specific portfolio.

888
01:32:05,110 --> 01:32:18,593
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that the superintendent and I spoke about very early in the year last year as something that from a structural organizational perspective we really needed to address because

889
01:32:19,753 --> 01:32:25,096
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself as assistant superintendent, functioning as a de facto transportation liaison, I think is inefficient.

890
01:32:25,697 --> 01:32:37,684
[SPEAKER_00]: And had we been operating at 100% capacity with regard to ridership last year, I probably would have urged that we do something about it sooner.

891
01:32:38,885 --> 01:32:46,770
[SPEAKER_00]: So going into this year, part of the reorganization and creation of the engagement office was to essentially divide those responsibilities up

892
01:32:47,410 --> 01:33:01,542
[SPEAKER_00]: between Miss Fiddler-Carrie and myself, which is essentially what we've done and so Miss Fiddler-Carrie is working closely with principals, and in most schools I think the actual de facto transportation liaison becomes the assistant principal.

893
01:33:01,982 --> 01:33:07,287
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that's necessarily a strategy or a structure that we ever sort of intentionally put in place.

894
01:33:08,327 --> 01:33:17,177
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's something that, as is the case in school systems, it falls to building level administrators when there's no other sort of structure established for it.

895
01:33:17,657 --> 01:33:25,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, in order, but that what that means is you're building level administrators are not doing something else that they should be charged with doing.

896
01:33:26,086 --> 01:33:29,309
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we've made progress with

897
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:44,249
[SPEAKER_00]: Incorporating that into miss feathers fiddler carries portfolio and I think it will always be there, to the extent that the work is about addressing family concerns and working with the external partner of Eastern Bus Company.

898
01:33:44,669 --> 01:33:45,871
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another body of work.

899
01:33:46,692 --> 01:34:05,624
[SPEAKER_00]: related to the TransFinder investment, in terms of making sure that the actual routes themselves are organized and plotted in a way that maximizes efficiency, that I think we may have to look at a potential personnel investment, at least in the short term, to get us to a place where there's a system that Ms.

900
01:34:05,644 --> 01:34:07,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Fridley-Carey can actually administer.

901
01:34:07,765 --> 01:34:12,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Because frankly, she's running into the same challenges that I was, just at a different level.

902
01:34:12,848 --> 01:34:16,269
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of there really isn't a system for us to administer.

903
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:26,253
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just sort of bus routes passed down over time, you know, from the time they were written on the cave to the time that we created a more aesthetically pleasing PowerPoint.

904
01:34:26,593 --> 01:34:30,114
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we have to address that as an organization in the near future.

905
01:34:30,154 --> 01:34:32,355
[SPEAKER_00]: But, Joan, I don't know if you wanted to comment on that.

906
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:33,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I just respond before Ms.

907
01:34:33,695 --> 01:34:35,936
[SPEAKER_11]: Bowen, just to say, may I, Mayor?

908
01:34:37,877 --> 01:34:38,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, Member McLaughlin.

909
01:34:39,430 --> 01:35:03,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, thank you, Mr. Murphy and I just, I just would respectfully ask my colleagues again to the chair that we recall this information when it comes budget time because it is, in my opinion and from what I've seen talking with families and especially if your child is, you know, not available for an hour or two and you're not really sure where they are and the angst and all the other things that that can cause this can be a full time job.

910
01:35:04,141 --> 01:35:15,946
[SPEAKER_11]: for one person, never mind, you know, a family and community engagement coordinator newly hired to really engage families around a number of issues so I think that's really important for us all to consider.

911
01:35:15,966 --> 01:35:20,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And then I would just also before Miss Bowen responds I just also want to mention that

912
01:35:20,908 --> 01:35:38,072
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, my concern around silos as well, Mr. Murphy, and I know you and I have had this conversation before and you've been very gracious in this conversation, but I do want to make sure that we're, you know, that it's not always sort of when there's a special education question and no reflection on you, but that it's deferred to, you know, to Ms.

913
01:35:38,092 --> 01:35:45,773
[SPEAKER_11]: Bowen, because I, again, want to just remind folks, and I know that it can sound like a beating a drum, but all of our students are general education students.

914
01:35:45,813 --> 01:35:48,034
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of them are receiving special education services.

915
01:35:48,414 --> 01:35:52,646
[SPEAKER_11]: And I really think we need to be thinking about how we're breaking down these silos so that we're not having.

916
01:35:53,163 --> 01:35:54,063
[SPEAKER_11]: different segments.

917
01:35:54,143 --> 01:35:55,224
[SPEAKER_11]: And that said, Ms.

918
01:35:55,244 --> 01:35:59,086
[SPEAKER_11]: Bowen, before you speak as well, we also have this out of district element.

919
01:35:59,186 --> 01:36:07,150
[SPEAKER_11]: And so in my instance, I have a child who happens to be out of district on our recent holiday that we had revised our calendar.

920
01:36:07,190 --> 01:36:10,611
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford didn't have school on this particular day.

921
01:36:11,252 --> 01:36:12,852
[SPEAKER_11]: My child is not a district placement.

922
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:13,813
[SPEAKER_11]: They did have school.

923
01:36:13,833 --> 01:36:16,054
[SPEAKER_11]: There's confusion around transportation.

924
01:36:16,094 --> 01:36:20,336
[SPEAKER_11]: The transportation didn't show up because they were confused that Medford didn't have school, what have you.

925
01:36:20,776 --> 01:36:25,298
[SPEAKER_11]: And in that instance, there's actually no one to call because, you know, Medford's not in school.

926
01:36:25,858 --> 01:36:35,903
[SPEAKER_11]: So how are we really thinking about a general program across all of our community in terms of dispatch and transportation and being thoughtful about all of these ideas instead of

927
01:36:36,283 --> 01:36:41,787
[SPEAKER_11]: still compartmentalizing or making subsections of people's jobs that already have full-time jobs.

928
01:36:41,827 --> 01:36:44,048
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that said, I guess I would ask Ms.

929
01:36:44,068 --> 01:36:44,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Bowen, and I know Ms.

930
01:36:44,989 --> 01:36:58,477
[SPEAKER_11]: Bowen, you and your staff have been remarkably responsive to a number of concerns that families have had, and especially for our more vulnerable students, where the risk can be heightened and the fear can be heightened for families.

931
01:36:58,497 --> 01:36:59,958
[SPEAKER_11]: So I want to thank you for that first.

932
01:37:00,771 --> 01:37:05,879
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to make sure that my colleagues are fully aware as we're considering the budget around these issues.

933
01:37:06,339 --> 01:37:16,214
[SPEAKER_11]: One, that we're thinking about a person for this position, and two, that we're thinking about how we are breaking down silos to create a more equitable and inclusive school district.

934
01:37:16,714 --> 01:37:17,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

935
01:37:20,252 --> 01:37:23,674
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you want me to address the transportation specialized transportation.

936
01:37:23,915 --> 01:37:24,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please.

937
01:37:25,516 --> 01:37:37,164
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as people are aware there was a story on the news about how there is a significant shortage of transportation and drivers, especially for students with special needs.

938
01:37:38,044 --> 01:37:54,211
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, we are working with multiple vendors to we combine rides with other districts we communicate with other districts if they have a run that's going to the same out of district program, we try to combine them as much as possible.

939
01:37:55,371 --> 01:38:00,013
[SPEAKER_10]: It is has had a significant impact on our transportation.

940
01:38:00,554 --> 01:38:01,394
[SPEAKER_10]: We communicate.

941
01:38:02,084 --> 01:38:08,846
[SPEAKER_10]: with the transportation companies multiple times a day to figure out what happened, how can we fix it?

942
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,486
[SPEAKER_10]: How can we communicate better with the families?

943
01:38:12,246 --> 01:38:15,107
[SPEAKER_10]: This is hopefully going to be improved.

944
01:38:15,627 --> 01:38:31,371
[SPEAKER_10]: We did get a message from one of our vendors stating that they are hiring more staff with the hope of some of these being able to expand the amount of runs that they do across the state, which will really help the districts in their transportation.

945
01:38:32,391 --> 01:38:36,194
[SPEAKER_10]: We do continue to work with these companies as issues arise.

946
01:38:37,335 --> 01:38:46,303
[SPEAKER_10]: I strongly suggest that parents contact my office so we can communicate with the different companies as these issues come up.

947
01:38:47,143 --> 01:38:48,144
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not perfect.

948
01:38:48,404 --> 01:38:58,532
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a real result and the reality of the COVID pandemic, but we are working really hard with these transportation companies to make sure our students get

949
01:38:59,513 --> 01:39:02,836
[SPEAKER_10]: to their schools and in home in a timely manner.

950
01:39:03,976 --> 01:39:04,337
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

951
01:39:04,397 --> 01:39:08,320
[SPEAKER_11]: And so may I may I just what's the plan for Thank you.

952
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:16,586
[SPEAKER_11]: So what is the plan for out of district families if in the audience since that our schools are closed, but an out of district placement is not and then there's a transportation issue?

953
01:39:16,966 --> 01:39:19,588
[SPEAKER_11]: How do what what do families do in that instance?

954
01:39:20,217 --> 01:39:29,645
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would ask them to email me, I checked my email even when we're not in school, I have the transportation numbers that we can call and look into it.

955
01:39:30,485 --> 01:39:37,951
[SPEAKER_10]: They can reach out Emery also when she is off she responds in regards to so if we are made aware of it we can respond.

956
01:39:38,852 --> 01:39:39,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

957
01:39:39,233 --> 01:39:44,498
[SPEAKER_11]: So even on days when you have off, you guys are sort of also having to work the transportation as well.

958
01:39:44,939 --> 01:39:45,700
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a day off.

959
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:51,246
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make sure that we're not going to take a day off when it comes to being needed to be responsive to families.

960
01:39:51,286 --> 01:39:59,034
[SPEAKER_00]: But just to be clear that this particular incident, we made a mistake with regard to our

961
01:40:00,456 --> 01:40:16,387
[SPEAKER_00]: level of coverage and I take responsibility for that mistake, given that my oversight of human resources, the district adopted a calendar in which there are more holidays being recognized and that's certainly within the purview of the committee to do that.

962
01:40:16,867 --> 01:40:28,370
[SPEAKER_00]: But in attempting to stay as consistent as we have, as we could with how we have function, based on the closest precedent we had the offices were closed.

963
01:40:28,910 --> 01:40:36,492
[SPEAKER_00]: I said to the bargaining units that I don't think we can continue that practice and I think we need to engage in the necessary steps of ensuring that doesn't happen.

964
01:40:37,432 --> 01:40:38,573
[SPEAKER_00]: for a variety of reasons.

965
01:40:38,973 --> 01:40:42,736
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is one of them to make sure that we always have the office coverage that we need.

966
01:40:43,116 --> 01:40:45,477
[SPEAKER_00]: So this particular instance was a mistake.

967
01:40:45,777 --> 01:40:51,681
[SPEAKER_00]: There were multiple offices involved in responding to it and there'll be multiple offices involved and make sure that it doesn't happen again.

968
01:40:51,701 --> 01:40:53,722
[SPEAKER_00]: And I apologize to the committee for the fact that it did.

969
01:40:55,463 --> 01:40:55,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor.

970
01:40:56,224 --> 01:40:57,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Van der Kloot.

971
01:40:57,805 --> 01:41:06,550
[SPEAKER_07]: While we're under the topic of transportation, it would seem we received a letter from a member of the public, which would be appropriate to read at this time.

972
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:07,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, thank you.

973
01:41:08,120 --> 01:41:17,283
[SPEAKER_07]: So community member Eleanor Klein wrote us to the school committee account regarding bicycle racks.

974
01:41:18,063 --> 01:41:25,785
[SPEAKER_07]: And she wrote that she wants to draw our attention to the bike racks at the middle and high school.

975
01:41:26,645 --> 01:41:32,187
[SPEAKER_07]: She included some photos of the bike racks, which she says the racks are outdated models

976
01:41:33,187 --> 01:41:35,569
[SPEAKER_07]: and unusable and difficult to use.

977
01:41:35,749 --> 01:41:44,997
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, they represent a very small percentage of available space dedicated to students alternative non-fossil fuel dependent transportation options.

978
01:41:45,958 --> 01:41:49,001
[SPEAKER_07]: She says she knows that the ones at the high school are frequently filled.

979
01:41:50,081 --> 01:41:54,025
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure the bike commission CC here can be valuable resource for ideas.

980
01:41:54,967 --> 01:42:00,692
[SPEAKER_07]: With the partnership connector she writes the opportunities for middle schoolers to bike to school safely will be expanded.

981
01:42:01,212 --> 01:42:04,635
[SPEAKER_07]: In addition, we as a city need to work on ways to encourage more cycling.

982
01:42:05,216 --> 01:42:12,102
[SPEAKER_07]: I would love it if we could start by making sure an ample quantity of usable racks are installed at our middle and high schools.

983
01:42:12,982 --> 01:42:17,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a plan or discussion around bike racks currently in our budget transportation planning?

984
01:42:17,525 --> 01:42:20,287
[SPEAKER_07]: If not, please make sure that this is added to the mix.

985
01:42:20,467 --> 01:42:22,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks very much, Ellery Klein.

986
01:42:23,248 --> 01:42:39,238
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do want to note that Dr. Cushing did respond and is willing to further the conversation and work with whomever he can to make this happen.

987
01:42:41,599 --> 01:42:42,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Member van de Kloot.

988
01:42:46,165 --> 01:42:48,406
[SPEAKER_15]: PB, Lupita D Montoya?s iPhone2?s iPhone2?s iPhone2?s

989
01:43:03,676 --> 01:43:14,549
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just a confusion around what parents do when there is an issue and an overwhelming feeling that parents have been told over the years, I'm not saying by any of you that it's not our problem.

990
01:43:15,170 --> 01:43:23,279
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and to call the bus company and I just want to make sure that as we think about how we're directing families to communicate these issues like.

991
01:43:24,100 --> 01:43:45,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't personally see sending a bunch of individual parents to the bus company in a one-off fashion as really a way to systemically solve any problems, but I just wanted to raise that to your attention so that we could perhaps get some communication out from the principals about what to do if these things happen and make sure that the principals are aware.

992
01:43:45,791 --> 01:43:50,193
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just would ask that you all think about how to do that so that parents

993
01:43:50,893 --> 01:44:01,339
[SPEAKER_02]: even if they have in the past absolutely been told it's not our problem, that you all can set a better message for the community of consistency in that regard.

994
01:44:01,359 --> 01:44:02,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Cushing?

995
01:44:03,129 --> 01:44:05,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much for bringing that up member Graham.

996
01:44:05,610 --> 01:44:13,413
[SPEAKER_09]: What I'd like to really say to all of our parents watching is that if you have an issue with the Met for public schools, the best place to go is the Met for public schools.

997
01:44:14,093 --> 01:44:25,677
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have an issue with your classrooms teacher or question please ask your classroom teacher, if you have an issue with transportation or something along those lines, please start with your assistant principal your principal and then we can forward up the chain as need be.

998
01:44:26,497 --> 01:44:33,882
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that then the process has started with the people closest to the problem and we can offer solutions.

999
01:44:34,363 --> 01:44:51,195
[SPEAKER_09]: And if for whatever reason you feel that you're not getting a response, as Mr. Murphy just mentioned, there isn't a day that goes by, including Saturdays and Sundays, that many of us aren't communicating with, talking with, and speaking with parents, either via email or telephone,

1000
01:44:51,675 --> 01:44:52,935
[SPEAKER_09]: for extensive periods of time.

1001
01:44:53,736 --> 01:45:01,518
[SPEAKER_09]: It is our problem because these are our children, and whatever the problem is together we're going to find a solution to make it better.

1002
01:45:02,099 --> 01:45:07,921
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I only just saw that communication on social media, while I was sitting here.

1003
01:45:09,182 --> 01:45:22,981
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, as great as a medium as social media is please feel free to reach out to your building principal, and then always myself Mr. Lucy Mr. Murphy were available as well to make the situation better.

1004
01:45:24,565 --> 01:45:25,625
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1005
01:45:26,266 --> 01:45:28,887
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had a relatively good opening of school.

1006
01:45:30,488 --> 01:45:30,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1007
01:45:31,328 --> 01:45:33,589
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand there were some comments on social media tonight.

1008
01:45:34,009 --> 01:45:46,335
[SPEAKER_00]: I may part ways with Dr. Cushing a little bit about how great of a medium I think social media is but I think it's, I do think it's great that folks can raise issues and make sure that we're aware of them out by whatever means necessary.

1009
01:45:47,496 --> 01:45:52,142
[SPEAKER_00]: But, by and large, this has been a successful opening of school, transportation included.

1010
01:45:53,223 --> 01:45:54,825
[SPEAKER_00]: We have issues that we need to iron out.

1011
01:45:55,206 --> 01:46:01,514
[SPEAKER_00]: I, unfortunately, I think we're going to have more issues over the next couple of weeks than we've had in the previous two weeks.

1012
01:46:02,115 --> 01:46:17,145
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's why it's really important that we set expectations because when you get to the point where the governor is activating the National Guard to address an operational issue being discussed with the school committee, that's an indication that we have some significant challenges upcoming.

1013
01:46:17,245 --> 01:46:28,372
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will be communicating aggressively with families to make sure that they are aware of some of the challenges and some of the short-term problems that they are going to encounter.

1014
01:46:29,652 --> 01:46:31,113
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will we will address them.

1015
01:46:31,153 --> 01:46:43,981
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we'll try to systemize our approach as much as possible so that we're not getting into sort of one off issues here and there, that I think could easily give a misperception to the community at large.

1016
01:46:44,201 --> 01:46:46,603
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have our commitment that we'll be working on that.

1017
01:46:47,143 --> 01:46:49,244
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Dr. Cushing said, it is definitely our problem.

1018
01:46:50,625 --> 01:46:51,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1019
01:46:52,959 --> 01:47:09,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to say I don't want any of the comments that we've been making about transportation to be construed as that certainly I don't think it has been a rocky transition to school I was actually so surprised when I did the tour last week with you how

1020
01:47:10,649 --> 01:47:16,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Much of a very normal school day building, I entered into times three.

1021
01:47:17,613 --> 01:47:19,394
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to say thank you for that.

1022
01:47:19,954 --> 01:47:26,438
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think I saw there was a district somewhere offering parents money to drive their own kid to school.

1023
01:47:27,578 --> 01:47:40,811
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not endorse that process, because I happen to be driving by Medford High School this morning and I thought to myself, do any students get to Medford High School on time because the backup, really in both directions was just stunning.

1024
01:47:42,432 --> 01:47:44,513
[SPEAKER_02]: So less cars would be better.

1025
01:47:44,533 --> 01:47:58,341
[SPEAKER_02]: And to that end, the other thing I was hoping that we could think about as we talk and work with Transfinder is whether, what the impact would be of changing that

1026
01:48:00,122 --> 01:48:10,508
[SPEAKER_02]: two mile radius to a mile and a half or one mile, what that would do for us as a community, what it would cost, what that impact is.

1027
01:48:11,168 --> 01:48:20,593
[SPEAKER_02]: There was, I had a discussion with some parents who in my mind, you know, I live near the high school, in my mind, they're way more than two miles away from me because it would

1028
01:48:20,833 --> 01:48:22,714
[SPEAKER_02]: take me 20 minutes to get to their house.

1029
01:48:22,834 --> 01:48:24,795
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, they're not.

1030
01:48:25,095 --> 01:48:27,036
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they're well within the two mile radius.

1031
01:48:27,877 --> 01:48:34,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are students who are either having to pay for bus passes or get transportation to school.

1032
01:48:35,561 --> 01:48:39,923
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just struck me especially this morning as I happened to be sitting at that stoplight and

1033
01:48:40,263 --> 01:48:56,264
[SPEAKER_02]: every stoplight between my house and Winthrop circle that these are all families, trying to get their kids to school they're all late at this point they're all very late, through no fault of probably their own because even I was sort of shocked at how long it took me to get out of Medford.

1034
01:48:57,105 --> 01:48:58,306
[SPEAKER_02]: To go where I was going this morning.

1035
01:48:58,366 --> 01:49:03,631
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can think about what that impact would be of bringing the radius in line.

1036
01:49:03,651 --> 01:49:12,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that could be really a productive conversation for us to have as a community for students for attendance for timeliness.

1037
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:15,742
[SPEAKER_02]: for public transportation and all the rest.

1038
01:49:15,862 --> 01:49:34,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can think about that as Transfinder does their work, so we know strategically what our goals are and what our options are so that we can have a good productive conversation at budget time, rather than doing what we did with the bus contract last time, which was issue the same RFP we had always issued, say yes and move on.

1039
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:37,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that would be a meaningful step in the right direction.

1040
01:49:38,532 --> 01:49:39,953
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I appreciate that.

1041
01:49:40,233 --> 01:49:41,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're right.

1042
01:49:41,914 --> 01:49:42,935
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to look at all those.

1043
01:49:43,295 --> 01:49:55,222
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't be able to have, forgive me for saying it so bluntly, but we're not going to be able to have an intelligent conversation about this until we have that partnership in place and we have real data to work with.

1044
01:49:55,662 --> 01:50:05,708
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried to buy ourselves some time with this three-month pilot program, which we're able to do because we're able to, essentially, the need to re-engage students in school and make sure that we're getting there,

1045
01:50:07,169 --> 01:50:12,435
[SPEAKER_00]: as quickly as possible, hopefully on time, makes it, I think, an appropriate ESSER expense.

1046
01:50:12,775 --> 01:50:17,280
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're able to use that and fund, if we have to extend the three-month pilot program, we can do that.

1047
01:50:18,661 --> 01:50:27,390
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the more systemic approach, and I will note that the contract was extended in the spring of 2020, and so we're going to have to look at

1048
01:50:28,091 --> 01:50:34,958
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of what is the capacity of this vendor or any other vendor eventually to really improve the system the way that we want to.

1049
01:50:34,998 --> 01:50:41,705
[SPEAKER_00]: But first we have to identify whatever internal efficiencies we can to try to address this situation.

1050
01:50:41,725 --> 01:50:43,767
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to expand access.

1051
01:50:43,807 --> 01:50:47,691
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make it as easy as possible to get students to school at every school

1052
01:50:48,752 --> 01:50:58,619
[SPEAKER_00]: So far it's been good, but to the points that have made, you know, certainly it's a great opening of school unless your student is the one that got returned to school because they didn't drop off the bus.

1053
01:50:58,639 --> 01:51:00,100
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very cognizant of that as well.

1054
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:03,083
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, we want to make sure that there's as few of those issues as possible.

1055
01:51:04,504 --> 01:51:04,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1056
01:51:05,464 --> 01:51:05,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1057
01:51:07,347 --> 01:51:09,188
[SPEAKER_15]: Number six, presentations of the public.

1058
01:51:09,448 --> 01:51:17,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Regular meetings of the school committee include this presentations of the public agenda item to give any resident the opportunity to place a presentation before the school committee.

1059
01:51:17,313 --> 01:51:20,295
[SPEAKER_15]: A resident may only present once at any meeting.

1060
01:51:20,835 --> 01:51:26,959
[SPEAKER_15]: These presentations are an opportunity for the public to make a presentation to the committee, but are not opportunities for dialogue with the committee.

1061
01:51:27,059 --> 01:51:34,904
[SPEAKER_15]: If one or more members of the committee wishes to have a conversation about the topic presented, a member may request that the item be added to the subsequent regular meeting.

1062
01:51:35,545 --> 01:51:42,589
[SPEAKER_15]: The details for submitting a presentation to be found within the policy be DH public comment and presentation of the public.

1063
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:52,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Tonight we do not have any public participation, public comment, pursuant to policy.

1064
01:51:53,398 --> 01:52:00,384
[SPEAKER_15]: public comment and presentations, the public, any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item of the agenda up to three minutes.

1065
01:52:00,604 --> 01:52:03,567
[SPEAKER_15]: The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

1066
01:52:04,147 --> 01:52:09,252
[SPEAKER_15]: The speaker must begin their comments by providing a full name and full Medford street address where they reside.

1067
01:52:09,832 --> 01:52:17,559
[SPEAKER_15]: Residents may also submit their comments by writing to the superintendent of schools prior to the meeting or by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

1068
01:52:20,652 --> 01:52:36,439
[SPEAKER_15]: prior to or during the item on the agenda written comments must be kept to a length that allows for them to be read into the record in less than three minutes, or the comments will be summarized with the Secretary of the school committee, a welcoming inclusive community is both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

1069
01:52:37,019 --> 01:52:40,240
[SPEAKER_15]: We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

1070
01:52:40,801 --> 01:52:43,802
[SPEAKER_15]: When writing or emailing please provide this required information.

1071
01:52:44,735 --> 01:52:48,521
[SPEAKER_15]: Number one, the name and number of the item on the agenda.

1072
01:52:48,702 --> 01:52:50,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Number two, your first and last name.

1073
01:52:50,605 --> 01:52:53,590
[SPEAKER_15]: Number three, your full Medford Street address, where you reside.

1074
01:52:54,091 --> 01:52:55,573
[SPEAKER_15]: And number four, your question or comment.

1075
01:52:56,781 --> 01:52:58,782
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe we addressed the one email we had.

1076
01:53:00,083 --> 01:53:01,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Number seven is continued business.

1077
01:53:02,184 --> 01:53:07,828
[SPEAKER_15]: We have two more items, nothing under continued business, two items under number eight, new business.

1078
01:53:08,268 --> 01:53:22,878
[SPEAKER_15]: First up, the Medford school committee may send one delegate and one alternate delegate to the MASC slash mass annual joint conference for the purpose of voting during the delegate assembly on the resolutions of the MASC.

1079
01:53:23,947 --> 01:53:42,998
[SPEAKER_15]: The conference is Wednesday, November 3 through Saturday, November six with the delegate assembly being held on Saturday, November six voting is presently only allowed in person and this is recommended that only members that are able to and are planning to attend the conference be nominated, offered by member Ruseau member Ruseau.

1080
01:53:43,458 --> 01:53:51,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mayor, I know if I should nominate myself I will be attending the conference this year and if any other members would

1081
01:53:52,185 --> 01:53:56,347
[SPEAKER_08]: be coming with me or would like to be nominated, I'm happy to do that too.

1082
01:53:57,527 --> 01:53:59,048
[SPEAKER_02]: I will also be attending this year.

1083
01:53:59,668 --> 01:53:59,968
Excellent.

1084
01:54:00,488 --> 01:54:01,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll also join.

1085
01:54:01,369 --> 01:54:03,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

1086
01:54:07,571 --> 01:54:08,552
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't make it either.

1087
01:54:11,313 --> 01:54:14,914
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Ruseau, Member Graham, and Member McLaughlin will be attending as delegates.

1088
01:54:15,935 --> 01:54:17,755
[SPEAKER_07]: We're allowed one delegate.

1089
01:54:17,856 --> 01:54:18,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1090
01:54:18,236 --> 01:54:18,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, Mayor.

1091
01:54:19,663 --> 01:54:20,983
[SPEAKER_15]: Member van de Kloot.

1092
01:54:21,124 --> 01:54:25,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we need to nominate our voting delegate in an alternative.

1093
01:54:26,786 --> 01:54:31,547
[SPEAKER_07]: And every school committee member is welcome to go.

1094
01:54:31,567 --> 01:54:35,949
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just the particular voting portion of the resolutions.

1095
01:54:36,929 --> 01:54:37,649
[SPEAKER_08]: May I?

1096
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:38,110
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1097
01:54:39,150 --> 01:54:39,650
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go ahead.

1098
01:54:40,070 --> 01:54:40,290
[SPEAKER_08]: May I?

1099
01:54:40,510 --> 01:54:41,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

1100
01:54:42,271 --> 01:54:46,433
[SPEAKER_08]: I have been the delegate before, and I found it to be very rewarding.

1101
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:51,952
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't believe member Graham or member McLaughlin have yet been to the conference.

1102
01:54:52,272 --> 01:54:58,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So I certainly would be happy to nominate one of them as the alternate.

1103
01:54:58,315 --> 01:55:03,218
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's helpful to go as an alternate before being the one in the hot seat.

1104
01:55:03,418 --> 01:55:08,821
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not that hot seat, but you know, I don't know if either one of them is interested.

1105
01:55:08,841 --> 01:55:10,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't prepared for three of us to go.

1106
01:55:10,942 --> 01:55:13,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Normally it's me and then Paulette shows up.

1107
01:55:14,584 --> 01:55:15,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll still go.

1108
01:55:15,344 --> 01:55:16,745
[SPEAKER_07]: I just don't want to be the delegate.

1109
01:55:17,468 --> 01:55:19,690
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so member Van der Kloot is out.

1110
01:55:19,930 --> 01:55:20,870
[SPEAKER_15]: She will be attending.

1111
01:55:21,111 --> 01:55:22,031
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there anybody else that?

1112
01:55:23,692 --> 01:55:24,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor?

1113
01:55:25,093 --> 01:55:26,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, member McLaughlin.

1114
01:55:26,814 --> 01:55:27,955
[SPEAKER_11]: I am fine with observing.

1115
01:55:27,995 --> 01:55:32,378
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't have to be the second for the delegate.

1116
01:55:32,438 --> 01:55:37,422
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would nominate member Graham to be the alternate if that is acceptable.

1117
01:55:38,803 --> 01:55:44,647
[SPEAKER_15]: So it seems like member Rousseau is nominated for the position and member Graham as the

1118
01:55:45,760 --> 01:56:01,398
[SPEAKER_11]: alternate delegate is their motion on the floor make a motion to nominate members so as the delegate and number Graham as the alternate for the MSC convention November 3 through November six, seconded by circuit member Vanderquist all those in favor.

1119
01:56:01,879 --> 01:56:04,201
[SPEAKER_15]: All those opposed, paper passes.

1120
01:56:04,582 --> 01:56:04,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1121
01:56:06,844 --> 01:56:18,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Number three, given that 10% of the human population is left-handed and in some classrooms, Medford Public Schools utilizes half desks, which are designed for the handedness of the individuals using the desk.

1122
01:56:18,991 --> 01:56:27,235
[SPEAKER_15]: By January 1st, 2022, every classroom will have sufficient left-handed desks in place for the number of students that are left-handed in that space.

1123
01:56:27,735 --> 01:56:34,459
[SPEAKER_15]: If information cannot be ascertained to the number of students that are left-handed, then 10% of the desk count in classrooms that have

1124
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:46,715
[SPEAKER_15]: These types of desk will be for the left handed students, offered by member so member Graham and member McLaughlin, who would like to speak first, as the South as a South by myself.

1125
01:56:48,378 --> 01:56:52,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I went, somebody brought this to my attention I was like.

1126
01:56:53,740 --> 01:56:53,980
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1127
01:56:54,260 --> 01:56:54,480
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

1128
01:56:54,580 --> 01:56:56,021
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no left-handed desks.

1129
01:56:56,101 --> 01:56:58,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Even we had left-handed desks when I was a student.

1130
01:56:59,122 --> 01:57:01,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I will also say that I hated left-handed desks as a student.

1131
01:57:01,943 --> 01:57:03,543
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't particularly work for me.

1132
01:57:05,184 --> 01:57:11,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Left-handed folks tend to learn how to write in really creative ways because right-handed people teach us to write.

1133
01:57:13,006 --> 01:57:15,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So left-handed desks are great if you write with a hook.

1134
01:57:16,287 --> 01:57:21,909
[SPEAKER_02]: In your hand, if you don't write with a hook in your hand, you end up like this and your elbow is sort of wiggling all around.

1135
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:29,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I would say is, if we're going to purchase desks to meet this mandate please can we purchase desks that don't

1136
01:57:30,787 --> 01:57:34,489
[SPEAKER_02]: require a handedness because those desks also don't work for everybody.

1137
01:57:34,629 --> 01:57:38,331
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume that right-handed desks also don't work for all right-handed people.

1138
01:57:38,351 --> 01:57:45,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I just know that as a lefty my whole life, I always struggled with the resources provided to me in school.

1139
01:57:46,035 --> 01:57:47,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

1140
01:57:48,516 --> 01:57:48,776
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor.

1141
01:57:49,937 --> 01:57:52,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Kreatz and then Member Van der Kloot.

1142
01:57:53,779 --> 01:57:55,039
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw what you like going first.

1143
01:57:57,241 --> 01:57:59,822
[SPEAKER_13]: My husband's a lefty, so in his

1144
01:58:00,375 --> 01:58:02,296
[SPEAKER_13]: sister and, you know, his father.

1145
01:58:02,736 --> 01:58:06,497
[SPEAKER_13]: So I, you know, I have to deal with the obstacles with him and he struggled.

1146
01:58:06,577 --> 01:58:19,320
[SPEAKER_13]: And yes, I think I did, you know, have noted that I think it would be I talked to my sister-in-law, my husband to have like a universal desk, that would be, you know, that would be ideal, you know, if that's something we could do.

1147
01:58:19,400 --> 01:58:28,383
[SPEAKER_13]: And I was just curious, if we know, you know, not like the necessary the number, but do we have an idea of

1148
01:58:29,488 --> 01:58:38,791
[SPEAKER_13]: you know how common are the, like this, the left hand side desk like do we have them at every school or just remember, I mean Mr. Murphy.

1149
01:58:39,051 --> 01:58:45,713
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, ma'am, that Miss Chris appreciate that question and when this issue was brought to our attention.

1150
01:58:46,573 --> 01:58:50,934
[SPEAKER_00]: We did pull the, the principles to get a sense as to what the landscape was.

1151
01:58:51,434 --> 01:58:53,495
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm happy to report that the.

1152
01:58:55,016 --> 01:59:06,382
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of L-shaped desks that are sort of at issue here that are advantageous or presumably advantageous to left-handed or right-handed individuals are only used at the high school.

1153
01:59:06,763 --> 01:59:12,726
[SPEAKER_00]: So at all other schools, I think it would be fair to say that the workspace is universal and

1154
01:59:15,428 --> 01:59:28,397
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to be left handed right handed or am I just to utilize them so it is an issue that's only at the high school at the high school there is a considerable number of these desks in use over 1000.

1155
01:59:29,077 --> 01:59:31,999
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, and so they are generally.

1156
01:59:33,245 --> 01:59:39,049
[SPEAKER_00]: constructed in a way that would make one presume that they were built for right-handed individuals.

1157
01:59:39,490 --> 01:59:53,821
[SPEAKER_00]: And any additional investment, we certainly could, I think to the point that's being made, we really want to get to a place where it's not a disadvantage to anyone based on any learning style or any type of sort of disposition with respect to that.

1158
01:59:53,861 --> 02:00:03,028
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the answer is yes, this won't be an issue for us and something that would be a worthwhile investment when the time comes to have additional desks.

1159
02:00:05,656 --> 02:00:06,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1160
02:00:06,297 --> 02:00:08,079
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy member Van der Kloot.

1161
02:00:08,259 --> 02:00:20,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, so I certainly would support this but I do want to let you know that it isn't the first time that it's been discussed that when we in fact built the new schools there were discussions about accommodating left handed students at that time.

1162
02:00:23,017 --> 02:00:26,280
[SPEAKER_07]: It came up again over a period of time.

1163
02:00:26,620 --> 02:00:33,165
[SPEAKER_07]: It's one of those things that it's just always good, though, to check on whether they're in the right place at the right time.

1164
02:00:33,185 --> 02:00:37,028
[SPEAKER_07]: And do we need more just because of the particular population?

1165
02:00:37,408 --> 02:00:40,671
[SPEAKER_07]: And of course, some of the deaths have bit the dust, so to speak.

1166
02:00:40,811 --> 02:00:42,332
[SPEAKER_07]: So we might be replacing them.

1167
02:00:43,833 --> 02:00:48,757
[SPEAKER_07]: We might have, I don't know, with right-handed deaths rather than left-handed.

1168
02:00:48,777 --> 02:00:50,258
[SPEAKER_07]: So I support the resolution.

1169
02:00:53,214 --> 02:01:07,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's appropriate for us so since there is an expenditure potentially for us to get a report back so that we understand what we're asking for in terms of if we have an additional purchase.

1170
02:01:07,931 --> 02:01:09,974
[SPEAKER_15]: And if I made just from from the chair as well.

1171
02:01:12,469 --> 02:01:22,696
[SPEAKER_15]: One of you could amend this to potentially have a plan presented to us so that we are efficient with our finances and we try to accommodate all children, whether you're left handed or right handed.

1172
02:01:22,716 --> 02:01:27,579
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there should be a plan sometime in the summer where you would know where the left handed students.

1173
02:01:28,107 --> 02:01:37,249
[SPEAKER_15]: will be placed in each classroom and we make accommodations depending on what desk works for them rather than just requiring 10% in each classroom.

1174
02:01:37,429 --> 02:01:38,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Just a thought I wanted to throw out there.

1175
02:01:38,729 --> 02:01:39,269
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Murphy.

1176
02:01:39,289 --> 02:01:39,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

1177
02:01:40,009 --> 02:01:41,050
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that makes sense.

1178
02:01:41,090 --> 02:01:52,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with any type of action like this, we would be inclined to make sure the committee is informed as to sort of how we have put the motion into action and what the investment is likely to yield.

1179
02:01:52,692 --> 02:01:56,053
[SPEAKER_00]: In this instance, my reading of the motion is that

1180
02:01:56,833 --> 02:02:10,445
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the district would be required to purchase 10%, a number consistent with 10% of the student population, unless we were able to ensure that any student who wanted a different type of desk had one.

1181
02:02:11,306 --> 02:02:14,288
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think this is going to be too difficult for us to comply with.

1182
02:02:14,769 --> 02:02:15,749
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what I would say is.

1183
02:02:16,610 --> 02:02:21,473
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll read the motion to include the plan that the mayor is suggesting.

1184
02:02:21,794 --> 02:02:25,656
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll come back to you with an update as to what investment we're going to make.

1185
02:02:26,137 --> 02:02:41,327
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's going to be a hugely substantial one, but I do think that we will be able to make sure that there is no student who would like a left-handed desk or a universal desk who is currently using a right one.

1186
02:02:41,387 --> 02:02:44,189
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was mentioned earlier, perhaps Ms.

1187
02:02:44,209 --> 02:02:44,369
[SPEAKER_00]: Graham,

1188
02:02:44,949 --> 02:02:49,431
[SPEAKER_00]: there are students who are left-handed that actually might prefer the desks that we have.

1189
02:02:50,431 --> 02:02:57,794
[SPEAKER_00]: The only sort of logistical challenge is that the nature of the high school, the only school for which this is applicable, the students are moving around all day to different rooms.

1190
02:02:57,874 --> 02:03:10,318
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely a logistical angle that we have to look into, but I'm comfortable that we'll both be able to report back to the committee and address this issue that's been raised in the next several months.

1191
02:03:10,498 --> 02:03:13,179
[SPEAKER_00]: And if for some reason we're not, we'll come back and we'll notify you.

1192
02:03:14,268 --> 02:03:14,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1193
02:03:16,570 --> 02:03:17,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Ruseau.

1194
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:18,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1195
02:03:18,151 --> 02:03:29,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, you know, when somebody has missed all of ninth grade at home and the first experience of Medford High is they go to every classroom and they can't write.

1196
02:03:33,021 --> 02:03:35,362
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, it just, that seems pretty devastating to me.

1197
02:03:35,923 --> 02:03:42,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to finally getting to your high school and you can't use the desks in every classroom you go to.

1198
02:03:44,088 --> 02:03:48,895
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I just think we wouldn't put up with that for a whole host of other things.

1199
02:03:49,896 --> 02:03:52,800
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not left handed so I don't know the experience.

1200
02:03:54,222 --> 02:03:57,066
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I mean,

1201
02:03:59,151 --> 02:04:12,975
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that being left-handed has ever been considered a disability, but I certainly think if we just said to somebody in a wheelchair, well, you know what, we'll just, you'll have to make do with that classroom, even if it's not accessible to you.

1202
02:04:13,195 --> 02:04:15,335
[SPEAKER_08]: We would all find that to be highly offensive.

1203
02:04:17,436 --> 02:04:26,539
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think asking every, at the beginning of every semester, having the teachers, everybody who's left-handed, raise your hand so I can then get the right desk in here.

1204
02:04:26,619 --> 02:04:27,839
[SPEAKER_08]: That also just seems a little,

1205
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:32,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I don't know that lefties anymore are ashamed of being lefties.

1206
02:04:32,283 --> 02:04:33,483
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't think that's a thing.

1207
02:04:33,523 --> 02:04:38,807
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think, as far as I know, I don't think that, I think it's important to distinguish this is not a disability.

1208
02:04:38,947 --> 02:04:39,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1209
02:04:39,368 --> 02:04:48,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it doesn't mean we don't have responsibilities to it, but there's no, it's just a, there's a difference in terms of obligation and perception and risk and everything like that.

1210
02:04:48,934 --> 02:04:57,741
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the point that Mr. Russo makes is that we know students are coming into a school environment, some of whom for the first time in a long time.

1211
02:04:58,341 --> 02:05:01,882
[SPEAKER_00]: some of whom are coming in for a new school, okay?

1212
02:05:02,182 --> 02:05:07,383
[SPEAKER_00]: And some all are coming in under like circumstances that none of us went to school in.

1213
02:05:07,823 --> 02:05:21,306
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think what's important is that at the building level, the staff and administrators who are closest to the students are communicating with students and listening to them to get a sense as to who needs any type of accommodation, any type of support, any type of service.

1214
02:05:21,707 --> 02:05:27,448
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we can definitely communicate to our teachers and to our administrators that to be mindful

1215
02:05:28,168 --> 02:05:42,496
[SPEAKER_00]: of how left handedness or any other characterization may be having an impact on a student's ability to access their, their programming, and then we and then we can respond I'd be hesitant to sort of broadcast.

1216
02:05:43,276 --> 02:05:51,720
[SPEAKER_00]: that we want to get new desks, because I suspect there will be some students who, whether they're right-handed or left-handed, might just like some new desks.

1217
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:57,102
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure we're going to have the most actionable data with regard to what type of infrastructure we get.

1218
02:05:57,162 --> 02:06:06,326
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that handling this at a building level, class level, even at a student-by-student level, we can make sure that this is not a barrier

1219
02:06:06,806 --> 02:06:11,189
[SPEAKER_00]: to anyone's education, because to Mr. Rousseau's point, we already have enough barriers, we really don't need any more.

1220
02:06:11,989 --> 02:06:22,395
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's important that we prioritize this type of access issue, which is really what we're talking about, and make sure that we're eliminating barriers, not perpetuating them.

1221
02:06:22,455 --> 02:06:28,538
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will definitely have this conversation with our building level administrators and make sure that this is something they're being cognizant of.

1222
02:06:29,779 --> 02:06:30,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1223
02:06:35,484 --> 02:06:37,025
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's a motion to approve.

1224
