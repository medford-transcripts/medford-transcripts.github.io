1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:06,016
All right, welcome everyone to the method-started study committee meeting June 6, 2024.

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:12,742
First order of business is to accept the minutes from May 16th.

3
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:14,644
Did everyone have a chance to look at them?

4
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:16,966
They're good.

5
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:17,607
Move approval.

6
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:18,588
Second.

7
00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:19,949
I make a motion to approve.

8
00:00:20,549 --> 00:00:20,850
I agree.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,011
All in favor?

10
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:23,272
Aye.

11
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:24,113
Excellent.

12
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:39,938
Okay, now we can go right into the composition of the school committee, which we had already decided, but we had the issue of combining wards, and I believe, Ron, you had some things to say about that.

13
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:42,459
I do.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:49,425
I think that the members of the subcommittee are mostly on this call, and I know they've looked at

15
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,793
the email that had all the details.

16
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,373
So I'll just go as quickly as I can.

17
00:00:55,433 --> 00:01:13,860
I think that the consensus with the group was that rearranging, combining wards was a task that not necessarily was under our purview, but we took on the challenge and I think we did a pretty reasonably good job.

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,000
I'll answer any questions.

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,141
I'm just going to give you the

20
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:27,383
When we initially started working with the numbers, the ward numbers were just out of whack.

21
00:01:27,683 --> 00:01:28,783
It was not balanced.

22
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:35,185
But when we received the new ward numbers from Milva, the numbers came in line pretty well.

23
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:36,825
There's the map.

24
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:57,459
And so the task was to realize that all this has to do really with is balancing population of voters amongst each district.

25
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,620
It doesn't have anything to do with demographics or makeup in that.

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,501
That's a totally different thing that we have no authority of doing anyway.

27
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,082
It's not that anybody would want to handle that.

28
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:10,203
But I have, Milva, do you have the...

29
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,372
Let me post.

30
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:14,934
Can you give me sharing ability?

31
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:17,957
Because I want to put up the numbers that we were using.

32
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:18,738
See if this works.

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:46,965
So just, so what I, when I contacted the elections department about the numbers that they provided, what I found out was that they gave us numbers from the most recent census, but the wards are drawn every 10 years and they use the federal census.

34
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:50,286
So those are the numbers that we would be looking at.

35
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:54,128
And they will, and the wards will, they will redo that process in 2031.

36
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:55,048
It was just done in 2020.

37
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:55,808
Right, it's every 10 years.

38
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:09,031
So as of now, any awards we combine, no matter which ones we combine, the numbers will work out okay because they were even when they were made.

39
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:10,292
Does that make sense?

40
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,582
And yeah, it's something that would constantly be adjusted.

41
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:19,903
But we took these numbers, which made it a lot easier to come up with.

42
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:24,585
We came up with two options just so we had some variety.

43
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,746
If you look at the numbers, again, they're pretty well balanced.

44
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:38,349
The delta between, you know, you're never going to get equal because there are some awards that are just larger.

45
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,471
And, you know, the number one goal was to be geographically connected.

46
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:50,479
because it doesn't make sense if we have one ward in North Medford and one ward in South Medford kind of defeats the whole purpose of ward representation.

47
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:53,300
So we wanted to make sure that they were together.

48
00:03:54,381 --> 00:04:00,604
And my thought was that not only together, but option one is sequential.

49
00:04:00,644 --> 00:04:07,727
So one and two is district one, three and four is district two, five and six is district three, and seven and eight is district four.

50
00:04:08,928 --> 00:04:09,829
It's just, it's,

51
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,331
it saves a lot of confusion.

52
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:26,235
And remember that in terms of ward representation, we're already giving the voter a new option to have local neighborhood representation by just doing this alone.

53
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,735
So to me, it makes sense.

54
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:37,118
I mean, everybody, I'm just opening it up because we really didn't take a vote on this, but to me, it makes sense one and two, three and four, five and six, seven and eight.

55
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:38,278
But if you look at,

56
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:47,042
The option two, which is a little bit more balanced that Paulette had worked on, you see that there's a difference of 200 voters, if you look in the Delta column.

57
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:51,945
So it's a difference of 200 voters, which is negligible in terms of, you know, who it is.

58
00:04:52,025 --> 00:05:03,611
So instead of having to identify, you know, six and eight, two and three, or I think I'm one and seven, it just made sense to me to do option one.

59
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,154
And I'll just listen to your comments of what you guys would like to do.

60
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:10,378
Ron, can I ask you a question?

61
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,079
Sure.

62
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,721
Can you put the map back up?

63
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:15,042
I like the visuals.

64
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:18,305
I'm going to stop sharing because Milva has them.

65
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:19,767
Okay, I'll put the map back.

66
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:29,790
I wonder if it would be actually more helpful, and I think it's in our school committee's subcommittee folder, the map with the schools pinpointed?

67
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:30,851
It is.

68
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:32,872
I could try to dig that up.

69
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:49,783
But actually, my comment was going to be that I was going to vote for or sort of back option two, because when I looked at that map that you're referring to, Eunice, option two creates a situation where there's at least one school in each district.

70
00:05:52,323 --> 00:05:56,465
So I thought that that was a plus.

71
00:05:56,806 --> 00:06:12,534
The other reason that I liked option two was because when we discussed this before, there were comments about the demographic issues that we have a majority minority ward, which is ward, I believe it's ward seven.

72
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:14,215
Let's see, I have that here.

73
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:24,061
And combining Ward 7 with Ward 1, which I think Option 2 does?

74
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:25,802
No.

75
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:27,082
Right?

76
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:28,763
1 and 7, yeah.

77
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:32,645
Maybe I'm wrong.

78
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,847
I think 6 is the ward.

79
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:35,707
You're right.

80
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:38,469
No, that doesn't make sense.

81
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:42,151
I don't think it was 6.

82
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:43,712
I don't know.

83
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:47,894
Yeah, yeah, no, it's seven.

84
00:06:47,934 --> 00:07:08,179
See, because, so, and seven and one, combining seven with one, one is the other ward that has the most, the largest population of minority population next to ward seven.

85
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:13,060
So by combining those, we keep, you know, we give that,

86
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:15,652
We dilute that power less.

87
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:17,433
That was my thought anyway.

88
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:19,313
Okay, Anthony.

89
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:27,755
When we look at the numbers for wards and districts, do we look at population?

90
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:30,736
We don't look at voters, number of registered voters.

91
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:31,456
Is that correct?

92
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,377
It's just general population?

93
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:37,217
Yeah, because they use the census, so.

94
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:43,619
Okay, so how many voters doesn't really matter?

95
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:47,483
not for drawing the wards, is my understanding.

96
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:48,744
Okay.

97
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:50,305
Population.

98
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:51,346
Right.

99
00:07:51,986 --> 00:07:53,167
At the state level as well.

100
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:55,129
Right.

101
00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:08,299
And just when, you know, I understand, you know, the desire, and I have it as well, to have, you know, diversity and representation, but can we, like,

102
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:12,240
Can we create a majority-minority district?

103
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,981
Is that okay, legally?

104
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:20,886
I know it's what people want, but is that something that can be done or does it have to be more like a natural

105
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:51,138
process or is that something that you know was caught you know usually caught mandated i just don't know enough about it um do you want me to answer that

106
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:52,333
Yes, please.

107
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:55,255
We have no authority to draw any wards.

108
00:08:55,695 --> 00:09:00,799
That is done in conjunction with the state and the city council every 10 years.

109
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,243
Well, I guess they create districts, I'm saying.

110
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:16,889
But of the wards that they created in 2021, when we look at the demographics of those wards, we do have one majority-minority ward.

111
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:47,268
that already exists um so that's that's all so what i'm saying is like i just want to say it's just like you know when we talk about you know majority minority like you know there could be you know different minority groups within that minority and uh we could you know we could be marginalizing one community and i think it's like

112
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:57,649
To even take that into consideration is way beyond my bandwidth, because I don't know how to do it correctly, is what I'm saying.

113
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:10,720
I could see just picking numbers and say, I'm going to put these two together for geographic reasons, but to kind of say, we're creating a majority-minority ward,

114
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:20,353
Minority and we kind of know disenfranchising a different minority, you know, you know what I'm saying?

115
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:21,793
It's very complicated.

116
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:22,534
Yeah.

117
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,815
Yeah, I agree with you.

118
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,532
The only reason I brought it up is because it has been a concern.

119
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:46,881
And I know that we have discussed as a whole committee and the subcommittee also talked about two communities, Lowell and Worcester, where lawsuits were brought against those cities for violations of the Voting Rights Act.

120
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:54,186
And so they then implemented ward representation because of that.

121
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:56,167
We are not dealing with that right now.

122
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:59,839
But we did look at the demographics of each ward.

123
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,619
We do have that information.

124
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,120
So it's something that we can see.

125
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,681
And so when we're combining wards, I feel that it's legitimate to consider it.

126
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:16,883
Oh, I think it's legitimate to consider.

127
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:25,685
I just don't know if we have the knowledge to do it correctly without kind of, you know,

128
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,954
Maybe yeah.

129
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:35,060
Okay.

130
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:47,969
Um, any other thoughts on these past these particular other thing I just wanted to say is, um, we can choose not to combine the wards and leave that up to the city council.

131
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:52,133
It would be the city council that would do it if we don't do it.

132
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:52,533
So

133
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:58,426
Can we give them that option?

134
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:05,433
Can we give them like, this is plan one and plan two?

135
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,754
Let Ron speak.

136
00:12:07,014 --> 00:12:07,795
He's going crazy.

137
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:08,816
Oh, Eunice, I'm sorry.

138
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:09,577
Your hand is up.

139
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:10,378
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:14,416
I guess I'll just, you know, a few things.

141
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:34,266
I think regardless of how we end up here, the city is going to have to put out a pretty, you know, robust education campaign because this is like a complete wholesale change to how, you know, we've done business for the last nine million years.

142
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:41,670
So, you know, for people to realize now that their school committee is not at large,

143
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:45,369
Um, you know, that that's that's a big deal.

144
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:53,760
So I think, you know, that's going to require a good deal of education and, you know, might take a couple of election cycles for it to catch on.

145
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,845
I think I don't really have a.

146
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:12,343
Um, I don't have a preference yet, whether it's option one or option to, um, my observations, um, Option one, if you look at, you know, the map and you see.

147
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:15,784
Um, you know, like the.

148
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:19,586
You know, furthest away point of.

149
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:29,737
is miles away from the most northern point of Ward 2.

150
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:44,309
Basically, the furthest points on either end of each ward are, I mean, city's only so big, but it's pretty wide gap.

151
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:49,353
Option 1, to me at least, seems like,

152
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:53,483
You get a little bit more diversity.

153
00:13:55,543 --> 00:14:00,884
In terms of racial and socioeconomic diversity.

154
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:06,385
Option 2, as I think it was Milva brought up a little while ago.

155
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:17,248
Pretty much gives us an elementary school in each district, or at least most and.

156
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:24,262
those wards, those districts are a little bit more socioeconomically similar.

157
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:45,791
Um, so, and then my third, my next point, my last point on this is if we went with option one, where it's sequential one, one with two, three with four, et cetera, et cetera, given my first point about this being a wholesale change for people, would it be,

158
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:50,604
Yeah, and like I said, I'm not married to either option at the moment.

159
00:14:52,286 --> 00:15:00,733
Would it be easier for the public out there to understand if we have the districts sequentially?

160
00:15:00,753 --> 00:15:02,694
I don't know.

161
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:05,757
All things worth discussing.

162
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:06,698
Thanks.

163
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:07,738
Thank you.

164
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,222
Aubrey and Anthony, do you still have your hand up?

165
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:13,183
Yes.

166
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:14,524
I think Ron is in front of me.

167
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:15,725
Aubrey and then Anthony.

168
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:17,869
Ron, do you still have your?

169
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:19,970
Yeah, I do.

170
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,751
Oh, sorry.

171
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:21,291
I can't.

172
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:23,272
Oh, OK.

173
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,274
So who's next then?

174
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:26,454
Go ahead, Aubrey.

175
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:27,375
You have to talk to it.

176
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:31,938
Well, I was going to throw a little.

177
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:45,467
I know this is last minute, but in the subcommittee, we were not, I was not fully, I was an out large voter and then changed my mind and see the merits of combined awards.

178
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:53,185
If it is difficult to propose combined warrants, I would not be sad to pull back to at-large voting.

179
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:55,607
Okay.

180
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:05,597
Okay.

181
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,362
I think Ron was next.

182
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:12,464
Just a couple of thoughts.

183
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:16,628
Number one is, the makeup of the awards are not changing at all.

184
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:23,215
Number two is, we don't have authority to do any kind of diversity balancing.

185
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:29,060
It's just not in our purview, so it's not something that is in front of this committee to discuss.

186
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:34,562
Next is the point that you make about who can make the funds.

187
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:37,963
The reality is we recommend city council and the mayor.

188
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:41,324
They can change the wards anytime they want.

189
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:43,785
If they want to change the wards, that's their prerogative.

190
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,965
They have the right to change anything we submit.

191
00:16:48,186 --> 00:16:54,611
I just, you know, I think that what we need to do is put a selection of wards in there.

192
00:16:54,791 --> 00:17:00,796
And, you know, if for some reason the city council doesn't like that, they have the prerogative to change it.

193
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,977
We don't have any recourse once they change something.

194
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:13,565
The other thing is what we've already done in terms of ward representation is a huge change for the city in terms of bringing the vote back to the neighborhood.

195
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,946
So we all should be proud of that.

196
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:19,248
To everybody else's point, I get it.

197
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:30,052
The new election commissioner, I think Paula had a conversation with her, and it's as simple as creating ballots in each district.

198
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:31,753
So it won't be confusing.

199
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:35,955
Everybody will see only the candidates that are allowed to be seen in their district.

200
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:45,621
And yeah, everything is a learning curve for sure, but, you know, the voters will need to educate themselves and the candidates will take that upon themselves to educate.

201
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:56,708
So I think that whether we go to option one or option two or something, you know, some other option is kind of a moot point.

202
00:17:56,768 --> 00:18:02,771
I think we can just, you know, I know we have a large agenda and I don't think this is as,

203
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:06,053
earth-shattering because it can always be changed.

204
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:12,675
I also want to make the point too that the subcommittee believes that this is not our role to do, but obviously it is.

205
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:28,761
But we also recommend that there should be established a review board that would consist something similar to the election commission that mandates by ordinance that a member of each of the major political parties are involved in that too because

206
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:35,903
you know, when we start building new wards and new districts and new, you know, there's always a political reason for doing those things.

207
00:18:35,943 --> 00:18:40,304
So that, that's, I just think a lot of this is out of our purview as for authority.

208
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:55,128
And I'd like to see us just move it, move it along and say, yes, we're going with ward representation by district here, city council, we're going with ward representation, and then just pass it off because it's, you know, we could sit, we could spend two years trying to figure out the perfect,

209
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:58,830
perfect choice and it would get changed.

210
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,251
So that's my opinion.

211
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:01,292
Yeah.

212
00:19:01,692 --> 00:19:02,673
Anthony and then Phyllis.

213
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:05,195
I just have one quick question.

214
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:24,712
I kind of agree with what Ron just said, but just in the sense that when we're doing district for a school committee and ward for city councilor, do other cities do that or do they just have all

215
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:27,228
You know, all districts.

216
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:30,751
So combined wards are not common.

217
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:39,377
But Lowell does have combined wards for school committee and just straight ward representation for city council.

218
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:43,100
So, so it is there is a precedent for it.

219
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:46,062
And that's the new that's just happened.

220
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:46,782
Is that right?

221
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:48,964
Like a year or two ago?

222
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:49,785
Yeah, right.

223
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:53,307
And Lowell, as we know, did that in response to the lawsuit.

224
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:54,188
Okay.

225
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,604
Oh, go ahead.

226
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:03,167
No, I just, I kind of, like I said, I kind of agree with Ron to kind of move along.

227
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:06,468
I don't think we're going to get like a good, clear resolution on this.

228
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:14,192
And I think maybe this is something we just pass along and tell the city council and the mayor, you know, this is what we recommend.

229
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:16,173
You guys figure it out because it's.

230
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:27,242
I think it is quite complicated, and there needs to be more kind of thought that goes into the creation of the district.

231
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:40,733
So just to make sure that we're not kind of doing it, you know, hurting any particular group, which I don't even know, you know, what group, you know, we don't even know.

232
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,395
We say majority, minority.

233
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:44,837
We don't even know what, you know,

234
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:47,723
what that means, so that's it.

235
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:50,244
I have nothing else to add.

236
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:52,086
Okay, Phyllis.

237
00:20:52,106 --> 00:20:53,807
Okay, I have three points.

238
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:57,249
First, I'm going to reiterate what Ron has already said.

239
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:07,096
We do not believe this is in our purview, but having been charged with this, the second point I want to make is I want to thank Ron and Paulette because they did a lot of work on this.

240
00:21:07,877 --> 00:21:13,281
And third, I don't know that this is proper protocol, but I'm going to make a motion.

241
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:14,822
If we must do this,

242
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:25,215
I make a motion to propose option two, because in option two, each of the combined districts would have a school in it.

243
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:28,356
So that my motion is to vote on option two.

244
00:21:30,237 --> 00:21:30,597
Second.

245
00:21:31,037 --> 00:21:31,898
The combination.

246
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:35,859
Okay, so we have a motion to

247
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:43,980
Just one point, Melva, you have the verbiage that Phyllis wrote up for this motion.

248
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,942
So it's just a matter of changing the words and what she wrote.

249
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:49,943
But she wrote up what it should look like.

250
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:51,084
I think you should have that.

251
00:21:52,464 --> 00:21:55,105
You mean for the text?

252
00:21:55,446 --> 00:22:00,088
The motion that we're about to vote on, she wrote the words for that.

253
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:26,706
Yeah and okay so but right now we're just I'm just going to say a motion to accept option two which I just want to write down so that's boards one seven two three uh four five and six eight am I right about that yeah thank you um a motion to accept that uh uh for the uh as districts for um

254
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:30,572
for the school committee.

255
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:33,792
I second the presentation.

256
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:34,173
OK.

257
00:22:34,193 --> 00:22:37,013
OK, we're going to do roll call.

258
00:22:37,153 --> 00:22:37,553
Phyllis?

259
00:22:38,454 --> 00:22:38,734
Yes.

260
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:40,974
Eunice?

261
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:41,975
Yes.

262
00:22:43,555 --> 00:22:43,855
Ron?

263
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:44,955
Yes.

264
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:46,596
Aubrey?

265
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:50,917
Yes.

266
00:22:51,077 --> 00:22:51,417
Anthony?

267
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:52,697
Yes.

268
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:54,858
And I'm also a yes.

269
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:55,950
Great.

270
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:56,731
All right.

271
00:22:57,111 --> 00:23:00,273
Congratulations.

272
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:01,614
I have one more thing to say.

273
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:07,038
I've now almost four times lost my internet because it keeps saying weak connection.

274
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,000
And I see that we have one more matter to vote on.

275
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:14,384
So I'm hoping we can get to that vote because I think I must be here for the vote.

276
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:17,466
The other thing is, if I'm not here, we're okay.

277
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,373
Yeah, we may end up voting on some other article items later.

278
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:33,643
But the other one that we have on the agenda is that we started talking about last meeting, the composition of the body for regular charter review.

279
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:45,253
So we decided last time to recommend charter review every first five years from the time that the new charter is ratified, and then after that, every 10 years.

280
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:55,138
So but what we didn't have a chance to thoroughly discuss or agree on is the composition of that body.

281
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,582
So have people had a chance to think about it?

282
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,604
Didn't we talk about it a little bit?

283
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:19,111
And it would be a larger amount than sharing the responsibility of selection between the mayor, the city council, and the school committee kind of as evenly as possible?

284
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:31,117
Well, the example charter we looked at had it as nine, I believe, nine members.

285
00:24:32,353 --> 00:24:36,637
Four appointed by the mayor, four by the city council, and one by the school committee chair.

286
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,559
Well, four by the city council president.

287
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,882
So I'll just put that text up.

288
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:55,335
So there was some discussion about how that's- I thought we had talked about bringing it into 11 and giving the school committee those other two, those other votes, those other selections.

289
00:24:56,086 --> 00:25:01,989
Yeah, we talked about some things, but we didn't come to any decisions and we were going to continue the discussion tonight.

290
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:04,150
So Eunice and then Aubrey.

291
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,051
Yeah, thanks.

292
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:08,412
I have a proposal here.

293
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:19,937
First of all, I'll say that I think all committee members should be voters in the city.

294
00:25:20,577 --> 00:25:23,378
None should be politicians.

295
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:24,479
None should be electeds.

296
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:30,263
Um, so that's off the top my suggestion is.

297
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:42,994
A committee of 12 and the reason I say that is because that's kind of what we've had all along and hopefully the next.

298
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:53,375
Group, you know, won't have as much work to do as we did starting a. You know, making a charter from scratch, but.

299
00:25:54,136 --> 00:26:02,966
You know, we were spread pretty thin sometimes, you know, we could have done more had we had more people in probably a lot of different respects.

300
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:08,550
And even tonight, just a little bit of a stretch to try and get a quorum.

301
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:21,938
So my suggestion is, and actually, I think it's Framingham that had a committee of 12, nine appointees, nine voting appointees, and three non-voting alternates.

302
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:36,169
and the alternates may participate in the discussion, do any research, participate every other way except for casting a vote unless one of the original nine drops off, resigns.

303
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:40,813
Not just doesn't show up for one meeting, but completely resigns.

304
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:46,237
All the appointees will be voters residing in Medford.

305
00:26:52,129 --> 00:27:07,336
My way of kind of divvying them up would be four from the mayor, four from the city council president, and four from the school committee vice chair.

306
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:16,521
And what I would like is, at minimum, each three of the

307
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:36,738
For an example, and this would go for the three appointers, each appointer would appoint one Democrat, one Republican, and one unenrolled of the voting body.

308
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:39,360
Actually, no, it would be each one of them

309
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:49,697
Yeah, so that would give you nine, and then one of whichever for their alternate choice.

310
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:53,539
It could be Democrat, Republican, or unenrolled.

311
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:59,262
But at least you'd have one from each party, from each of the three appointers.

312
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:05,725
As I said, no member will be a current elected official or employee by the city.

313
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:09,968
We'll reach those people in another fashion, just like we did this time.

314
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:23,006
And I also strongly recommend the following, that committee members have a working knowledge of the current charter as it stands five years from now.

315
00:28:24,387 --> 00:28:38,197
And some experience interacting with city government, either having watched an ample enough number of city council and school committee meetings,

316
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:47,493
It's my belief that we need to understand where we are and where we were to determine where we're going.

317
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:59,095
So to have experience interacting with our local government and watching meetings to understand what works and doesn't work, I think is really important.

318
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:09,257
And to a lesser extent, it would be helpful if the committee members had some sort of familiarity as well with the multi-member bodies.

319
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:14,011
watching some meetings, attending some, interacting with them.

320
00:29:14,892 --> 00:29:16,373
So that's my two cents.

321
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:18,434
OK, thanks.

322
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:25,100
So hold that proposal, and I just want to let other people speak, and then we'll come back to it.

323
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:26,961
Aubrey.

324
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:32,926
I've been going to propose.

325
00:29:33,006 --> 00:29:33,726
Sorry, I was muted.

326
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:38,350
I'm going to propose keep nine, three each.

327
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:49,071
I don't mind, Eunice's idea of alternates, but I don't want to include restrictions.

328
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:52,634
I think that that can be part of the appointing body.

329
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:56,116
Okay.

330
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:58,418
Okay.

331
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:00,620
Phyllis and then Ron.

332
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:08,085
I don't know why we have to get into Democrat, Republican, Independent.

333
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:10,107
I don't know what anyone on this screen is.

334
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,472
I think we might limit choices there.

335
00:30:14,492 --> 00:30:18,315
And I don't know.

336
00:30:18,335 --> 00:30:25,379
I agree with Eunice on certain things that they should have a little familiarity with what's going on in the city.

337
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:36,767
I don't know if we miss a good person, because I haven't had that, that they might bring something else with them to the point.

338
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:38,888
I agree there should be a resident of the city.

339
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:45,301
have some interest also in moving the city forward.

340
00:30:47,103 --> 00:30:52,130
But I'm not sure we need to have one Democrat, one Republican, one Independent.

341
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:55,494
It's a non-starter for me.

342
00:30:55,514 --> 00:30:58,538
Okay, thank you.

343
00:30:58,658 --> 00:30:58,859
Ron.

344
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,644
Yeah, I agree with what Phyllis said and what Eunice said.

345
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:11,392
I think that having substitutes or whatever the bench members doesn't make sense to me.

346
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:14,015
If you're going to work on the committee, you should have a vote is my opinion.

347
00:31:14,696 --> 00:31:16,638
Secondly, I think that

348
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:25,658
giving, you know, if we're looking for who has to find the Republican, is it the mayor, the city council, the school committee?

349
00:31:25,678 --> 00:31:28,881
So you'd really be chasing and probably eliminating a lot of people.

350
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:34,445
I'm more in favor of just having Medford residents makes a lot of sense, of course.

351
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:41,831
But in terms of what your philosophies are, what your, honestly, to be what your base of knowledge is should be up to the,

352
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:45,473
Nominating board.

353
00:31:45,513 --> 00:32:06,449
I mean the people who pick the candidates will be responsible for those they pick and I don't know if we've ever uh, you know this kind of dictate qualities that we need is not necessarily you know, I would like them to have the freedom to to give it to who they think of the best people in there and who and and again again, we are under a

354
00:32:07,965 --> 00:32:14,786
where this board, this review board only recommends to the people who are gonna make this decision.

355
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:22,528
So I just, the more rules and qualifications we put on there, the less likely they are, in my opinion, to get in.

356
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:25,928
So I think there should be method residents.

357
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:31,689
I think there should be anybody who's on the review board should have a vote, whatever that number is.

358
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:34,470
I think nine sounds good to me, but that's all.

359
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:36,795
Okay, thank you.

360
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:42,161
So we have a couple, we have a little bit of discussion and a couple of potential proposals.

361
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,304
I got my hand up again.

362
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:45,866
Oh, Phyllis, go ahead.

363
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:47,928
I'm going to make a motion.

364
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:48,829
Okay.

365
00:32:50,131 --> 00:32:55,738
I'm going to make a motion that the committee consists of nine people.

366
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,302
and that they be chosen for what they could bring to the table.

367
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:06,005
And by that, I mean, I think Eunice brings a good point that people, certain people should appoint them.

368
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:07,406
I think that's important.

369
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:15,131
I think like we did this time, but I'm proposing that we have a nine member board, there'd be a nomination and an acceptance process.

370
00:33:16,652 --> 00:33:20,975
And that's my proposal for the review committee going forward.

371
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:29,980
So, okay, so the motion is that this body that we're talking about, the Charter Review Committee, be composed of nine people.

372
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,104
Do you wanna be more specific about what you said with the nomination and a review process?

373
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:41,668
Well, the only thing I said is they should be nominated and then accepted.

374
00:33:41,928 --> 00:33:44,330
I don't know who's gonna set the nomination process.

375
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,534
Okay, so the motion right now on the table is basically just addressing the number of people on the committee.

376
00:33:51,345 --> 00:33:52,566
So we could start with that.

377
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:55,507
Yeah, I mean that makes sense to break these things down.

378
00:33:55,527 --> 00:34:01,730
Okay, but we don't have a second yet but we also have a couple of comments so Eunice and then Aubrey.

379
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,911
Um, well I think as far as the number goes.

380
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:12,110
Nine or 12, yeah, I'm kind of okay with either.

381
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:32,704
I think, you know, I went with the 12 largely based on the fact of our experience here for the last almost two years, where, you know, like I said, you know, at the outset, there were times where we sure could have used a few more bodies.

382
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:39,361
Um, you know, if we had had a few more bodies, what else could we have done?

383
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:58,505
You know, now granted the next crop isn't going to be hopefully inventing an entirely new charter, but still to do some of the outreach and, um, you know, to the community, uh, interviews, surveys, events, et cetera, as well as, um,

384
00:35:01,012 --> 00:35:11,154
just, you know, the amount of research and things that, you know, so many of us have done to be able to, you know, divvy that up.

385
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:17,856
I see Frances is, you know, you know, I was just, I went with either nine or 12 because that would give

386
00:35:23,977 --> 00:35:36,240
the three appointers, you know, equal value, unless, you know, maybe we gave the mayor, you know, two more, because the mayor is as well the mayor.

387
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:47,262
I think my biggest thing, you know, and it would be in this board and any other board or commission,

388
00:35:49,640 --> 00:36:08,893
is how do you get a diversity of opinions, especially if one particular political group seems to be, you know, the dominant power in Medford, and they may appoint people that

389
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:15,177
you know, put forth, you know, their thought processes and their agendas.

390
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:19,499
How do we, how do we get differing voices?

391
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:32,485
And that's, you know, and whether it's the charter commission or the community garden or the zoning board or whatever, I think it's important to have a diversity of opinions.

392
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:36,207
And if you've got, you know, maybe the mayor, the president,

393
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:51,312
the CC president and the school committee vice chair, all from one particular dominant political group, they're going to be looking for the people that align with them.

394
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:53,954
You look confused, Phyllis.

395
00:36:57,597 --> 00:36:58,318
Phyllis, you're muted.

396
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,929
Yeah, I'm trying to unmute myself.

397
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:04,252
I'm having a hard time hearing a lot, too.

398
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:10,657
I'm confused, Eunice, because I guess my point is that we don't know how the nomination process is going to go.

399
00:37:10,717 --> 00:37:19,263
But if the mayor is going to appoint, like she appointed everyone, or he appointed everyone on this committee, I would say that we are a good diverse group.

400
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:22,105
I really think we are.

401
00:37:22,266 --> 00:37:27,930
I mean, several things have to go into, you know, like when I was asked to maybe consider joining this,

402
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:32,313
I had to write why I wanted to do it, but I didn't have to put any political affiliation.

403
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:34,214
I was asked, what could I bring?

404
00:37:34,275 --> 00:37:35,095
What do I expect?

405
00:37:35,435 --> 00:37:36,216
And all those things.

406
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:40,899
So that's why Milva said we should do it one piece at a time.

407
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,342
So maybe we should get to the number first and then the nomination process.

408
00:37:45,103 --> 00:37:53,309
But I looked confused, Milva, because I was trying to recall how we were all appointed, which was by the mayor after our application.

409
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,644
And then we apply, that's right.

410
00:37:58,185 --> 00:37:59,285
Of the bunch that applied.

411
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:00,246
That's right.

412
00:38:00,306 --> 00:38:03,668
And I think we're really well diverse group in lots of ways.

413
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,329
We bring lots of different things with us.

414
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,710
Okay, thank you.

415
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:12,613
So before we look at the motion for a body of nine.

416
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:15,055
I'd like to say something.

417
00:38:15,475 --> 00:38:16,856
Yeah, go ahead, Anthony.

418
00:38:18,717 --> 00:38:23,440
I just wanted to say that, you know, something that was brought to our attention

419
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:36,688
Early in the process is that where our committee has no diversity of of color, or, you know, we're all in, you know.

420
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,671
We don't really represent.

421
00:38:40,495 --> 00:39:06,225
uh the community and that that future charter commissions uh committees uh should have some kind of mechanism that you know we have more representation not of political uh views but of uh of people you know of age you know uh young old black white you know uh um you know uh non-english speakers i mean it

422
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:21,501
If we're really going to be a diverse, welcoming community, we should really strive to be inclusive of other things than political party.

423
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:25,924
Our system in Medford is supposed to run as nonpartisan.

424
00:39:26,004 --> 00:39:27,525
Our elections are nonpartisan.

425
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:34,470
We elect people as individuals.

426
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:43,756
There might be a slate in town and that might be dominating the political landscape now, but by the time this goes into effect, who knows?

427
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:48,399
There could be other groups, there could be other people.

428
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:51,634
uh, politics shifts and changes.

429
00:39:52,314 --> 00:39:56,216
I don't think that, you know, the charter commission should be based on that.

430
00:39:56,236 --> 00:40:02,918
I think it should be based on kind of people, you know, get different people, uh, involved in government.

431
00:40:03,518 --> 00:40:05,659
And that's my two cents.

432
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:10,681
And I don't know how to do that other than to just kind of, uh, have some type of, uh,

433
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:26,003
statement that the mayor or city council should do what they can to select people from different communities so that we really get a true sense of what the people of Method want.

434
00:40:27,923 --> 00:40:28,343
Thank you.

435
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:29,264
Aubrey.

436
00:40:33,205 --> 00:40:39,987
Ten years from now, I don't know that we'll know what this is going to look like, and I am optimistic.

437
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:45,792
and I'm trusting our voted bodies to be able to make those decisions.

438
00:40:46,672 --> 00:40:57,719
And so I would like to propose that we have a nine-member special committee with three from the mayor, three from city council, and three from school committee.

439
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,680
Okay.

440
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,242
So that is basically adding on to Phyllis's motion.

441
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,605
Before we go ahead with that, Veron, did you have one more thing to say?

442
00:41:09,629 --> 00:41:12,914
No, I agree 100% with what Aubrey just said.

443
00:41:13,675 --> 00:41:18,381
I think our theme has been recently, we're not legislating how this process gets done.

444
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:23,027
We're establishing a process and trusting that the leaders will do what they need to do.

445
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:27,973
getting the voters to remember that they are the ones who have the ultimate power.

446
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:37,595
So I think the next round of review is going to be a lot easier, a lot less discovery needs to be done, and hopefully it becomes a patent that everybody follows.

447
00:41:37,635 --> 00:41:42,756
But, you know, I think we always forget that the voter is the final power in this play.

448
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:48,897
So I agree with Aubrey's, and yeah, I just want to make sure that the Medford residence is the requirement.

449
00:41:49,097 --> 00:41:49,337
Thanks.

450
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:49,777
Okay.

451
00:41:50,137 --> 00:41:52,718
So before we go ahead with that, Anthony, did you have one more comment?

452
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,640
He just didn't put his hand down.

453
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:55,281
Okay.

454
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:56,581
I just, I'm sorry.

455
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:57,501
I didn't put my hand down.

456
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:58,322
That's okay.

457
00:41:58,562 --> 00:42:05,904
But I would like, I would like to amend and see if anybody's willing to let me amend that to make it 11, 11 members.

458
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:17,748
So, uh, we can, you know, have, you know, extra people in case the committee, uh, can't, uh, can't keep, you know, the nine members.

459
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:22,229
If nine members turn into six or five, uh, you know, with, uh,

460
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:29,692
where people dropping off, I think the process, I don't wanna shortchange the process.

461
00:42:30,152 --> 00:42:34,716
I think we need more people involved and I think 11 work better than nine.

462
00:42:35,717 --> 00:42:43,823
Okay, so we have, so if we just start with the number, we have one proposal on the table for nine and one for 11.

463
00:42:43,984 --> 00:42:46,886
May I ask a question?

464
00:42:47,386 --> 00:42:47,607
Yes.

465
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:51,370
If we say nine and then there aren't nine,

466
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:55,535
Does that mean that they have to then replace it to get to nine?

467
00:42:55,956 --> 00:42:58,558
Like, I'm wondering if we have 11 and dropped, then we have to keep 11.

468
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:01,380
If we have nine, then we have to keep nine.

469
00:43:02,821 --> 00:43:03,662
Is that how that works?

470
00:43:04,162 --> 00:43:08,386
If it's in the charter, it's going to be that way unless it gets changed.

471
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:12,929
So it's pretty set in stone, I think.

472
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:17,553
I think we should wait.

473
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:26,173
So I don't know what the best way to go about this is, because we have nine or 11.

474
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:30,335
Let's have a quick vote on nine.

475
00:43:30,715 --> 00:43:31,256
On the nine?

476
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:32,436
The motion that we do nine members.

477
00:43:34,337 --> 00:43:34,657
Second?

478
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:36,218
Second.

479
00:43:36,758 --> 00:43:38,339
Okay.

480
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:39,999
Aubrey?

481
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,000
Yes.

482
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:44,141
Phyllis?

483
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:45,002
Yes.

484
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:45,842
Eunice?

485
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:51,149
Go back to me.

486
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,010
Anthony.

487
00:43:53,951 --> 00:43:54,211
No.

488
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:57,453
I already got you Ron, right?

489
00:43:57,473 --> 00:43:57,954
Did I get you?

490
00:43:58,414 --> 00:43:58,754
No.

491
00:43:59,375 --> 00:43:59,655
Okay.

492
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:00,735
Ron is a yes?

493
00:44:00,796 --> 00:44:01,216
Yes.

494
00:44:02,997 --> 00:44:03,637
I'm a yes.

495
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:04,938
Phil, Eunice?

496
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:06,419
No.

497
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:07,900
Okay.

498
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:10,182
So we landed at nine.

499
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:16,966
So now the next question is the composition of that or the,

500
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:19,689
the appointments.

501
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:27,702
So Aubrey had proposed three, three, three, three from the mayor, three from the city council president and three from the school committee vice chair.

502
00:44:28,628 --> 00:44:36,812
I'm sorry, can I just amend that so we just call it city council and school committee and let them determine how they pick?

503
00:44:36,852 --> 00:44:44,635
Because the mayor is the chair of the school committee, so she would be able to pick six technically with that rule.

504
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:49,697
So I'd like to see the city council and the school committee develop their own plan on how they're going to pick it.

505
00:44:53,203 --> 00:44:55,164
I mean, that's why we said vice chair, right?

506
00:44:55,384 --> 00:45:01,648
So if we do it that way, we could, but then those bodies would have to spend time figuring that out.

507
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:08,133
Whereas, you know, it's a quicker appointment process if it's one person, that's all.

508
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:10,374
Anthony.

509
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,197
I'm sorry, I can't get my hands out.

510
00:45:15,578 --> 00:45:18,579
I just wanted to say, I understand the,

511
00:45:19,895 --> 00:45:23,178
inclination to make it even between the three bodies of government.

512
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:39,014
But the school committee is so specialized and the school committee, in terms of what's in the charter on the school committee, it's pretty narrow because the school committee is really governed by state law, pretty much the composition of the school committee.

513
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:47,615
is in the charter, and maybe some very general timelines about budget.

514
00:45:47,735 --> 00:45:50,057
Nothing really even that specific about budget.

515
00:45:50,737 --> 00:45:53,018
So, I don't know.

516
00:45:53,479 --> 00:45:57,181
I'm just, I wonder if we should make it equal due to that.

517
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:58,622
Just throwing that out there.

518
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:01,864
I think we lost Phyllis.

519
00:46:02,204 --> 00:46:02,684
Oh, no, we didn't.

520
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:03,164
She's there.

521
00:46:03,364 --> 00:46:04,825
I think that's a great point, Belva.

522
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:06,266
I think that's a great point.

523
00:46:06,446 --> 00:46:07,046
Should be more like 432.

524
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:12,503
The example charter we looked at had 4-4-1.

525
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:20,491
So 4-3-2 is, I mean, 4-4-1 gives the mayor and the city council equal number of appointments and says to the school committee, we want you to have a representative basically.

526
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:41,203
I mean, 432 says, well, the mayor gets more, I don't know.

527
00:46:41,443 --> 00:46:42,124
It's just, yeah.

528
00:46:45,084 --> 00:46:45,544
What do we think?

529
00:46:45,564 --> 00:46:47,886
I hate to keep saying this, but I'm going to lose.

530
00:46:48,146 --> 00:46:49,207
I'm going to lose you soon.

531
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:50,247
OK.

532
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:51,628
I don't know.

533
00:46:51,748 --> 00:46:52,909
We're down to nine.

534
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:55,071
We got we got.

535
00:46:55,471 --> 00:46:58,393
So it's not stressful.

536
00:46:58,953 --> 00:46:59,554
Hi, Danielle.

537
00:46:59,994 --> 00:47:05,718
We're discussing the composition of the Charter Review Committee, which is going to be nine people.

538
00:47:05,738 --> 00:47:07,619
So we're discussing how they are appointed.

539
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:17,424
And three from the mayor, three from the city council president, three from the school committee vice chair was proposed.

540
00:47:17,464 --> 00:47:24,211
And then I pointed out that the school committee's role, you know, the school committee is governed by state law.

541
00:47:24,351 --> 00:47:27,575
So the charter really only addresses the school committee composition.

542
00:47:28,856 --> 00:47:33,321
So my question is, should they have as much input in the pits?

543
00:47:34,341 --> 00:47:44,587
I'd like to make a motion that we establish a review board of nine members, four appointed by the mayor, four appointed by the city council, and one appointed by the school committee.

544
00:47:46,288 --> 00:47:47,449
I second that motion.

545
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:48,710
Okay.

546
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:49,990
All right.

547
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:50,951
Let's vote then.

548
00:47:51,991 --> 00:47:52,352
Ron.

549
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:55,754
Ron says yes.

550
00:47:56,614 --> 00:47:56,974
Aubrey.

551
00:47:59,516 --> 00:48:00,376
Aubrey says yes.

552
00:48:01,357 --> 00:48:01,797
Phyllis.

553
00:48:03,525 --> 00:48:04,265
Ellis says yes.

554
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:05,466
Okay.

555
00:48:05,806 --> 00:48:06,146
Eunice.

556
00:48:06,946 --> 00:48:09,607
Eunice says yes, since we're all talking in the third person.

557
00:48:09,627 --> 00:48:12,268
Try getting on your phone.

558
00:48:12,908 --> 00:48:13,088
Yes.

559
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:15,449
Anthony.

560
00:48:15,469 --> 00:48:18,530
I'm going to abstain.

561
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:20,831
Okay.

562
00:48:21,171 --> 00:48:22,571
And I'm voting yes.

563
00:48:23,011 --> 00:48:23,931
Did I miss anybody?

564
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:25,312
I don't think I did.

565
00:48:26,466 --> 00:48:41,627
Okay, so the only thing that we didn't talk about was, I mean, we touched on some of the issues that Eunice brought up in terms of, you know, requiring that they all be residents, requiring, you know,

566
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:45,605
other things.

567
00:48:45,685 --> 00:48:47,166
So there was some discussion of that.

568
00:48:47,306 --> 00:48:48,306
Eunice, do you want to?

569
00:48:50,706 --> 00:49:05,030
My first question is, and maybe this goes back to, circles back to whatever we said about multi-member boards a long time ago, is it residents or is it voters?

570
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,481
two different things.

571
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:14,007
So what did we say about multi-member boards or did we?

572
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:19,392
Maybe we didn't, but it should be consistent across the board.

573
00:49:21,514 --> 00:49:26,979
I mean, it could, yeah, it could be consistent or we could decide to make it different.

574
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:30,983
I don't know, but I'd have to look back at what we said about multi-member boards.

575
00:49:31,023 --> 00:49:31,804
Does anybody remember?

576
00:49:35,602 --> 00:49:38,523
Is there an age requirement to be on a board or commission?

577
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:40,584
Not that I know of.

578
00:49:41,084 --> 00:49:46,345
So you could be not eligible to vote, but you could be on?

579
00:49:47,106 --> 00:49:48,746
It depends on whether we say voters.

580
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,667
Just to pull up the example text that we looked at says voters.

581
00:49:52,947 --> 00:49:58,689
So if we said voters, that would put an age requirement on it.

582
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:28,024
or we could say residents or, I mean, Anthony, I'm sorry to keep asking you, but you're... Well, since my hand was already up by accident, I kind of have the same questions Danielle is bringing up is that, you know, age, residents, you know,

583
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:43,656
You know, just because you don't vote doesn't mean you're not a resident and you're not a taxpayer and that the government doesn't affect your life and that you shouldn't have a say in what happens in a community.

584
00:50:44,157 --> 00:50:58,443
I mean, we have people here that live here in Medford who can't, say, vote for the mayor or the school committee, but, you know, should be able to participate in the government because, you know, they live here.

585
00:50:59,025 --> 00:51:01,206
pay taxes, and they're part of our community.

586
00:51:01,286 --> 00:51:24,971
So any way we could include them, you know, even though they may not be able to vote, you know, I think we should, you know, Medford should, you know, strive to be an inclusive place where, you know, you know, the new members of the community actually have some kind of voice in City Hall.

587
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:33,200
Okay, so that would be an argument for saying residents instead of voters.

588
00:51:34,661 --> 00:51:36,802
Okay, I agree with that.

589
00:51:37,622 --> 00:51:39,443
I think it should be consistent.

590
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:44,224
You know, I mean, this is this is a multi member board too.

591
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:46,005
So that's true.

592
00:51:46,025 --> 00:51:46,325
You know.

593
00:51:49,617 --> 00:51:51,979
It's either 1 way or the other for everything.

594
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:54,960
I think unless there's some specific reason.

595
00:51:55,541 --> 00:52:00,304
Maybe well, no, we don't have the elections commission wouldn't come under this.

596
00:52:00,904 --> 00:52:01,725
That might be different.

597
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:04,627
You might have to actually be a voter, but.

598
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:10,150
I think for anything else, it's either 1 way or the other.

599
00:52:12,131 --> 00:52:17,215
So, I guess the election commission does require you to be a member of a political party.

600
00:52:17,255 --> 00:52:17,555
I believe.

601
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:26,214
Yeah, yeah, they have, I think, two of each, two Democrats, two Republicans.

602
00:52:26,234 --> 00:52:31,379
Does anybody remember what the language of multi-member boards?

603
00:52:31,979 --> 00:52:33,961
I'm looking it up here.

604
00:52:36,303 --> 00:52:43,809
I remember we, well, we did have a discussion about using that language of voters, but that might've been for running for office.

605
00:52:45,598 --> 00:52:50,219
Well, I think running for office, I mean, that's not a local decision, I think.

606
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:51,379
Yeah.

607
00:52:51,879 --> 00:52:54,980
From the Secretary of State, you have to be a voter, so.

608
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:00,582
Okay.

609
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:07,483
We don't say anything about it in the current language we have.

610
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:14,485
We just say that the mayor refers the names to the city council,

611
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:17,956
and then the city council can confirm.

612
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:24,964
or that they go in unless the city council rejects them.

613
00:53:25,324 --> 00:53:33,429
There's a whole section in section nine that we'll get to eventually that I think talks about multi-member bodies.

614
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:35,430
That might be where- Yeah.

615
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:36,531
We haven't discussed it yet.

616
00:53:36,991 --> 00:53:37,751
Something like that.

617
00:53:37,871 --> 00:53:42,494
I just couldn't remember if we touched on it when we did other stuff about the bodies.

618
00:53:43,235 --> 00:53:43,475
Yeah.

619
00:53:43,555 --> 00:53:44,075
No.

620
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:46,677
I think the answer is we haven't discussed it yet.

621
00:53:47,377 --> 00:53:51,719
But we are discussing it now in relation to the charter review body.

622
00:53:51,739 --> 00:54:04,924
So, I mean, I guess we could just combine them and say we're going to decide whether we want it to be residents or voters for any multi-member body, which includes this body.

623
00:54:04,944 --> 00:54:06,385
Does that make sense?

624
00:54:08,736 --> 00:54:16,882
Unless it's unless it's required by state law, like the election commission, you know, something that's something that you need to be a voter for.

625
00:54:16,902 --> 00:54:22,727
I mean, you need to be a voter, but to be on the, you know, the bicycle commission, if you're.

626
00:54:23,466 --> 00:54:34,212
you know, unable, you know, you're a resident alien and you're a bicycle rider, you should be, you know, have, you know, say on the bicycle commission, you know.

627
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:34,592
Right.

628
00:54:34,892 --> 00:54:42,056
Well, anything in the charter regarding, you know, if there are certain bodies that are governed by state law that would apply.

629
00:54:42,496 --> 00:54:47,239
So the charter is really only talking about the bodies that aren't governed by law.

630
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:56,566
So what do we do we think that's a good approach to make this decision for all multi member bodies?

631
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:00,534
Voter or resident?

632
00:55:02,478 --> 00:55:02,819
I think so.

633
00:55:04,362 --> 00:55:06,502
whatever I think we decide on has to be consistent.

634
00:55:07,023 --> 00:55:13,624
It just also has to say we're allowed by state law, because there are some commissions that have to have some kind of balance.

635
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:19,965
So this verbiage should say something about within general laws of the state of Massachusetts.

636
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:25,286
I think Collin Center will like, you know, catch that stuff for us.

637
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:29,727
So are we amending this?

638
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:32,848
Are we going to Article 9 and doing that now?

639
00:55:33,817 --> 00:55:50,586
No, we have the charter, we have the charter body, the charter review body, but I guess we're kind of morphing, moving into the overall Articles 5 and 9 issues that people might have questions about.

640
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:59,150
So, which units, you said there's a section in there for... I think there

641
00:56:00,063 --> 00:56:01,904
Is or if not, I put it there.

642
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:10,187
I can't remember because I was doing a whole lot of research on Article 9 over the last day or so.

643
00:56:12,768 --> 00:56:26,854
Well, if we decide we want the charter to say, you know, something about eligibility for serving on these bodies, we can just tell that to the Collins Center and they'll put it in the appropriate spot.

644
00:56:27,214 --> 00:56:28,555
Anthony, do you have your hand up?

645
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,421
Sorry, I keep asking you.

646
00:56:34,462 --> 00:56:36,304
Okay, so.

647
00:56:36,324 --> 00:56:41,409
Do does somebody want to make a motion on this or.

648
00:56:42,951 --> 00:56:45,913
I mean, as it is right now, if we say nothing about it.

649
00:56:48,176 --> 00:56:52,460
I would imagine it's up to the appointing authority, you know, the appointing body.

650
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,301
I think what about.

651
00:56:54,704 --> 00:57:06,972
putting something in like we've done in some other places before where, you know, this body is, what's the word I want?

652
00:57:06,992 --> 00:57:10,754
You know, and refer them over to section nine.

653
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:15,017
Any rules regarding this,

654
00:57:16,713 --> 00:57:29,583
Unless spelled out here, any rules regarding the Charter Commission are the same rules as governed by multi-member bodies in Article 9-4 or whatever.

655
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:37,635
And we just moved to make a decision whether we want residents or voters to be the qualifier.

656
00:57:37,695 --> 00:57:42,298
And then, as you said, no, the call and send is going to catch it when it comes up again.

657
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:48,241
And we're all going to have to vote on it again when we talk about the general commissions and boards.

658
00:57:48,301 --> 00:57:58,807
So if we could get this, you know, an idea of are we for residents or for voters, registered voters, at least that gets us beyond this because it's going to come up again.

659
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,641
Okay, that sounds good.

660
00:58:00,941 --> 00:58:09,786
I just want to make one point, which is that I don't think that we are required to put anything about eligibility for these in the charter.

661
00:58:09,906 --> 00:58:22,573
We have the appointing authority for multi-member bodies, and if nothing is said, then the appointing authority makes a decision about who to appoint and doesn't have an eligibility requirement to deal with.

662
00:58:24,855 --> 00:58:35,384
And I think maybe in the example charter we looked at for the Charter Commission one, they've decided that they wanted that body to be voters, so they put that in that particular section.

663
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:43,372
So I'm just throwing it out there that we can choose not to include it and leave it at the discretion of the appointing authority.

664
00:58:44,283 --> 00:58:45,104
Can I ask a question?

665
00:58:45,805 --> 00:58:53,573
When the building committee meets and the building commissioner is on that committee, is he a non-voting member?

666
00:58:55,355 --> 00:58:56,336
That I don't know.

667
00:58:56,496 --> 00:58:58,838
Because he wouldn't have to be a Medford resident to be on that.

668
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:00,120
Right, exactly.

669
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,763
So there's a lot of scenarios that we're not...

670
00:59:04,644 --> 00:59:15,536
To paint this all in one scenario is not easy because there are a lot of folks who work with these departments and commissions that are not residents because their expertise is not in the city.

671
00:59:17,939 --> 00:59:20,942
Is Frances still with us?

672
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:22,804
Frances, I think, is on her phone.

673
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:29,724
Um, I know she oversees a bunch of boards, including, I think, the human rights commission.

674
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:33,647
And I think chief Buckley has voting rights.

675
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:39,110
On that commission, and I don't believe he's a Medford resident.

676
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:44,393
So, so to Ron's point, I think, you know, maybe it does differ with.

677
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:53,618
I move that we vote that the members of the Charter Review Commission must be residents of the city of Manfred.

678
00:59:54,198 --> 00:59:55,959
Must be residents, not voters?

679
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,781
I second that motion.

680
00:59:58,821 --> 01:00:05,046
We can yay or nay that one, and then that would leave us with the other, which is just to be voters, so just to be.

681
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:10,610
Okay, so Aubrey, were you going to say something?

682
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:15,253
Or the third option, which was Milva's suggestion, which is to not have any

683
01:00:16,623 --> 01:00:18,323
This is a 9, 4, 4, 1.

684
01:00:19,264 --> 01:00:19,644
Right.

685
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:26,805
Would somebody be able to make up like, when they go to choose the commission, would they be able to make it more narrow eligibility requirement?

686
01:00:26,925 --> 01:00:29,446
Or like, is it better that we define it more broadly here?

687
01:00:29,466 --> 01:00:36,368
I think the Medford requirement is extremely important and I would like to see it on the charter.

688
01:00:36,388 --> 01:00:38,048
Other than that, no.

689
01:00:38,748 --> 01:00:38,928
Yeah.

690
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,929
I mean, I think being a resident is just a no brainer.

691
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:42,609
Yeah.

692
01:00:43,569 --> 01:00:44,850
They can make it more narrow.

693
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:46,190
Welcome to Medford.

694
01:00:48,096 --> 01:00:49,837
Have you made that as a motion, Ron?

695
01:00:49,857 --> 01:00:52,099
Because I'd second it if you had.

696
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:58,743
The motion is that all charter review members must be residents of the City of Medford.

697
01:00:59,944 --> 01:01:00,684
I second that.

698
01:01:01,465 --> 01:01:01,825
Okay.

699
01:01:02,445 --> 01:01:04,347
So, Ron?

700
01:01:05,187 --> 01:01:05,507
Yes.

701
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:07,108
Anthony?

702
01:01:07,829 --> 01:01:08,069
Yes.

703
01:01:08,629 --> 01:01:08,950
Eunice?

704
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:09,790
Yes.

705
01:01:11,211 --> 01:01:11,591
Aubrey?

706
01:01:13,573 --> 01:01:13,793
Yes.

707
01:01:15,234 --> 01:01:15,674
Danielle?

708
01:01:16,698 --> 01:01:16,898
Yes.

709
01:01:17,498 --> 01:01:18,498
Did we lose Phyllis?

710
01:01:21,339 --> 01:01:21,819
Ah, maybe.

711
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,240
Yeah.

712
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:30,182
I'm actually going to vote no, because I actually think for this particular thing, they should be voters.

713
01:01:30,242 --> 01:01:30,842
But that's OK.

714
01:01:31,182 --> 01:01:33,482
So we'll save residents for this.

715
01:01:34,723 --> 01:01:39,144
Can I move reconsideration and vote no as well, along with you?

716
01:01:39,804 --> 01:01:40,084
Sure.

717
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:43,485
And that still passes.

718
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,183
Okay.

719
01:01:49,663 --> 01:01:49,883
Great.

720
01:01:50,584 --> 01:01:52,566
So I think we're done with the unit.

721
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:55,088
I mean, Aubrey, did you want to say something?

722
01:01:55,128 --> 01:02:05,117
There's a section in 9.4 that says all members of the committee shall be voters, but this is for the review of ordinances in the city.

723
01:02:05,518 --> 01:02:07,620
So I think we just be consistent.

724
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:17,135
Um, actually, with the consistency issue, because we're saying that there are like already boards and commissions that have their own criteria.

725
01:02:17,876 --> 01:02:23,464
So I don't, I feel like it's okay to have different opinions for different boards and commissions.

726
01:02:23,982 --> 01:02:25,023
I agree with that too.

727
01:02:25,823 --> 01:02:31,586
But this particular, just to be clear, what we're looking at is just an example text.

728
01:02:31,686 --> 01:02:34,288
This isn't our draft necessarily.

729
01:02:35,068 --> 01:02:43,613
So what I wanted to do with this, because we didn't have subcommittees that were actually drafting these sections,

730
01:02:44,453 --> 01:02:48,855
is make pertinent decisions and then the Collins Center will draft it for us.

731
01:02:49,095 --> 01:02:53,777
And actually, I think that periodic review of ordinances was one that I wanted to look at.

732
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:57,959
Because a lot of it is standard language, but this one we probably should decide about.

733
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,641
So first of all, are we done with periodic review of charter?

734
01:03:03,921 --> 01:03:04,601
I think we are.

735
01:03:06,162 --> 01:03:12,725
I mean, there is a timeline here in this particular, I believe this is Melrose's.

736
01:03:16,724 --> 01:03:19,785
You know, that's probably standard language.

737
01:03:19,805 --> 01:03:27,248
It might be good to keep the timeline in there, but we can let the call-in center put that in for us.

738
01:03:27,288 --> 01:03:28,189
Are people okay with that?

739
01:03:29,229 --> 01:03:33,931
Yeah, it seems pretty reasonable.

740
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:36,772
Okay, now what about periodic review of ordinances?

741
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:42,135
Do we think every five years is good for that, or is that too often?

742
01:03:46,491 --> 01:03:49,578
Do we know what is the protocol now?

743
01:03:49,898 --> 01:03:50,981
Is there an ordinance now?

744
01:03:52,023 --> 01:03:52,905
I believe there are.

745
01:03:53,706 --> 01:03:55,791
It's not in the charter, I don't think, but does somebody know?

746
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:58,228
I don't think it's in the charter.

747
01:03:58,348 --> 01:04:14,655
I think actually, as when the city council this year put out their governing agenda back in January and divided themselves up into about seven or eight standing committees.

748
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:21,498
I think each standing committee has purview over certain

749
01:04:23,297 --> 01:04:24,357
areas and topics.

750
01:04:25,117 --> 01:04:49,123
And I think one of the things that each of the standing committees has vowed to do over the course of their two year term is take whatever sub areas that they're responsible for and go through ordinances in that, you know, in that, in their purview and, um, you know,

751
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:57,805
update them, sunset them if need be, or basically give them an overhaul.

752
01:04:59,946 --> 01:05:01,968
We've added ordinances over the years.

753
01:05:02,588 --> 01:05:13,955
I don't think there's been any actual real good effort at overhauling the ordinances in heaven knows how long.

754
01:05:15,616 --> 01:05:17,297
I think having this in there,

755
01:05:18,454 --> 01:05:22,056
at intervals.

756
01:05:22,076 --> 01:05:35,584
I think whatever they're doing now, like what we've done with the charter, five years from now and 15 years from now, whoever is doing it isn't going to be doing what we did.

757
01:05:35,624 --> 01:05:45,229
When the council does their ordinances over this two-year term, then five years later, they should only be making tweaks and not reinventing it.

758
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:46,210
Right.

759
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:52,764
So whatever the first review of ordinances, if this gets into the charter, will be probably more extensive then.

760
01:05:52,784 --> 01:06:01,326
I do notice that the language of this one says some or all of the ordinances of the city, which is interesting.

761
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:07,387
And maybe that makes sense because I don't know, what do people think?

762
01:06:08,407 --> 01:06:10,448
Do we even know how many ordinances are in?

763
01:06:10,568 --> 01:06:15,409
Do we have like, is it a little ordinance book or is it like, you know, a filing cabinet?

764
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:19,256
It's on its code on the city website.

765
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:21,277
And I think it's pretty extensive.

766
01:06:22,697 --> 01:06:24,338
And I think that's why it says some.

767
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:26,579
Yeah, that makes sense.

768
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:33,981
An ordinance that was created a year ago isn't going to need to be revamped in all likelihood, but an ordinance.

769
01:06:34,421 --> 01:06:39,423
And a new ordinance can be, I mean, they can change, the city council can change it without this review board.

770
01:06:39,523 --> 01:06:41,364
I mean, ordinances can be changed.

771
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:42,252
Of course.

772
01:06:42,272 --> 01:06:45,013
I mean, it's not nobody has to wait.

773
01:06:45,193 --> 01:06:50,274
But I mean, that's why I think it's some because there's always it's a it's an ongoing process.

774
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:56,575
Well, OK, so do people think that it's a given what Ron just pointed out?

775
01:06:56,875 --> 01:07:00,356
Is it necessary to have a periodic review of ordinances in the charter?

776
01:07:01,536 --> 01:07:02,076
Oh, yeah, well.

777
01:07:03,036 --> 01:07:09,798
Well, the thing is, like the city council, you know, that's what they were elected to do was to, you know, did a legislature they

778
01:07:11,969 --> 01:07:28,907
isn't it up to the elected city council to kind of decide whether they're going to go through ordinances or they have other things to do or you know do we have to kind of put a you know a sword over their head you know is it you know that they have to do it because it's in the charter

779
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:34,633
I'm just wondering why Melrose has that in their charter.

780
01:07:35,053 --> 01:07:45,179
I think that it's not unusual for it to be in the charter and this wouldn't necessarily be, this is not the city council that's reviewing the ordinances, it's a special committee.

781
01:07:46,179 --> 01:07:55,589
But I think a part of this process is making sure the legality of the ordinance is still in effect because it also says we need, it's under the supervision of the city solicitor.

782
01:07:55,629 --> 01:08:00,875
So I think it's a validation that, you know, is this legal?

783
01:08:01,596 --> 01:08:06,361
And, you know, continuing to check up to, you know, if the state changes the law, are we up to date on it?

784
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:07,963
I think that that's really what it's about.

785
01:08:11,026 --> 01:08:13,028
Okay, Eunice, do you have something you want to say?

786
01:08:13,128 --> 01:08:19,675
Yeah, I mean, I think we probably have some, you know, some things in there that are pretty well outdated, too.

787
01:08:19,735 --> 01:08:26,463
I mean, the city council's job is zoning, passing the budget, and creating ordinances.

788
01:08:26,783 --> 01:08:28,726
That's their three main jobs.

789
01:08:32,664 --> 01:08:45,717
I think to have a committee that is going to look at our ordinances at some specific interval, I think is a good thing.

790
01:08:45,797 --> 01:08:55,427
I think it ensures that we're, like Ron says, things remain legal, things remain contemporary.

791
01:08:56,539 --> 01:09:07,265
Um, you know, I mean, you don't want to be looking at an ordinance that says, you know, you can't park your horse and carriage on 4th street in front of the post office, you know, or something like that.

792
01:09:07,345 --> 01:09:10,047
I mean, but I think we have some pretty outdated stuff in there.

793
01:09:10,747 --> 01:09:16,591
So, um, uh, I, I, I would, I'm a proponent of keeping this there.

794
01:09:17,291 --> 01:09:17,631
Okay.

795
01:09:18,152 --> 01:09:18,452
Aubrey.

796
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,160
I was going to say something similar.

797
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:28,762
I like the idea of keeping the option and it can be as big or as little review as happens to be needed.

798
01:09:30,682 --> 01:09:37,483
So do we like, I mean, does somebody want to propose, do we like five-year intervals?

799
01:09:38,423 --> 01:09:40,744
That's pretty, does that seem like pretty often or?

800
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:43,224
It does seem often.

801
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:46,765
If we have the charter every 10 years after the first

802
01:09:48,964 --> 01:09:53,147
My suggestion is we do the first one five years and just follow the charter.

803
01:09:53,787 --> 01:09:55,028
And then after that, 10 years.

804
01:09:55,088 --> 01:10:00,252
Because this probably hasn't been done in anybody's recollection that this has actually been done.

805
01:10:00,452 --> 01:10:06,036
So maybe we need one within five years and then 10 years after that, similar to the charter.

806
01:10:06,616 --> 01:10:07,196
Sounds good.

807
01:10:07,477 --> 01:10:16,543
Just to be my own devil's advocate, I'll say given that this has some or all doing it every five years could maybe be more productive because you could

808
01:10:17,393 --> 01:10:18,354
Maybe, you know, I don't know.

809
01:10:18,534 --> 01:10:22,818
I'm just, you could cover what you didn't cover five years earlier.

810
01:10:22,838 --> 01:10:24,699
I don't, I mean, just throwing that out there.

811
01:10:31,025 --> 01:10:34,948
But I think 10 years is sufficient too.

812
01:10:35,949 --> 01:10:44,877
Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, given the fact that there's so many things in this city that haven't happened with any regularity, I think,

813
01:10:47,437 --> 01:11:11,556
having a calendar in there where things are required to happen, even if it seems, I mean, if it's every five years, then the committee can get together and maybe, you know, for argument's sake, there's 50 ordinances and maybe, you know, they only need to look at, you know, five, you know, it'll be a quick committee.

814
01:11:12,136 --> 01:11:13,938
At that five year interval, they'll do that.

815
01:11:13,998 --> 01:11:15,058
And then the next five years.

816
01:11:15,139 --> 01:11:15,359
Yeah.

817
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:15,879
Okay.

818
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:16,840
Um, Aubrey.

819
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:35,526
I don't have a strong opinion about the years, but I think that an odd number would put it at a different point in the cycle every time it happened.

820
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:43,030
And this particular text from this charter has this special committee established by ordinance.

821
01:11:43,451 --> 01:11:43,631
So

822
01:11:46,146 --> 01:11:55,814
It would be sort of handing over the responsibility of deciding how many people and all that to the ordinance.

823
01:11:56,614 --> 01:12:00,257
The only requirement I see in here is voters, backed voters.

824
01:12:06,262 --> 01:12:06,602
So.

825
01:12:06,923 --> 01:12:08,824
Maybe this should be an ad hoc committee?

826
01:12:13,508 --> 01:12:15,610
I mean, as opposed to.

827
01:12:17,856 --> 01:12:24,079
one that is created so you don't like the ordinance language?

828
01:12:24,919 --> 01:12:27,180
I'm thinking out loud here.

829
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:43,908
It's created by ordinance, but then every time the calendar rolls around to when the review needs to be done, then somebody would be appointing

830
01:12:44,942 --> 01:13:03,792
the members of the committee, because if I serve at the five year interval and then it needs to be done five years later, you know, did serving in 2024 and then 2029 again, you know, somebody would need to be appointing a whole new committee once their work is done, you know,

831
01:13:14,094 --> 01:13:23,241
it takes them six months or a year or however long to get their work done, then they don't really have a purpose until the next interval comes up.

832
01:13:24,342 --> 01:13:24,602
Right.

833
01:13:25,043 --> 01:13:25,943
They would just be a one.

834
01:13:26,063 --> 01:13:28,785
I think I read this as an ad hoc committee.

835
01:13:28,926 --> 01:13:33,689
Once they do the review, they're done until five years later, and then it's a new committee.

836
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:34,390
Right.

837
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:37,412
And made up of completely different people.

838
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:38,233
Yeah.

839
01:13:39,762 --> 01:13:42,103
Can we get a ruling from the Collins Center?

840
01:13:42,123 --> 01:13:47,066
Because it seems to me that the responsibility of a lot of this is on the city solicitor side.

841
01:13:47,566 --> 01:13:57,931
And there may be some Massachusetts general laws that require a review of our ordinances on a regular basis that we're just not even aware of.

842
01:13:58,872 --> 01:13:59,572
That's true.

843
01:14:03,214 --> 01:14:04,435
So what do we want to do about this?

844
01:14:04,475 --> 01:14:04,975
Do we want to...

845
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,921
Tell the call center we would like a periodic review of ordinances section or.

846
01:14:11,941 --> 01:14:19,563
I think I think I heard agreement on that.

847
01:14:21,703 --> 01:14:24,884
And it's obviously appointed by the city council because their ordinances.

848
01:14:25,904 --> 01:14:30,145
Yeah, but the mayor, you know, is involved because.

849
01:14:33,026 --> 01:14:33,906
But the yeah.

850
01:14:34,582 --> 01:14:59,347
two-thirds vote they can so yeah it's do we know how long it takes to review ordinances no but i but we're but we're surmising that that's one of the reasons it says some or all because um because it would may be too big of a task to actually review all of them um do we know

851
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:03,194
Who reviews ordinances?

852
01:15:03,594 --> 01:15:05,978
I mean, is it attorneys?

853
01:15:06,098 --> 01:15:07,239
Is it people?

854
01:15:07,259 --> 01:15:16,611
Ordinances could be pretty complicated and have a pretty big impact on life in Medford.

855
01:15:19,347 --> 01:15:22,109
Right, so what happens after they review them?

856
01:15:22,209 --> 01:15:24,811
Do they give them back to the city council?

857
01:15:24,851 --> 01:15:26,652
Like, do something about this?

858
01:15:26,672 --> 01:15:34,717
I don't I don't really understand the process, you know, based on this particular text example that we're looking at.

859
01:15:35,433 --> 01:15:38,954
The committee is established by ordinance.

860
01:15:39,695 --> 01:15:48,178
They file a report with the city clerk at a date specified by the ordinance, which is basically just recommendations.

861
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:54,420
But they are also under the supervision of the city solicitor.

862
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:58,862
So they work with the city solicitor to make the recommendations.

863
01:16:00,105 --> 01:16:03,246
And then they present those recommendations just like we're doing.

864
01:16:03,266 --> 01:16:13,988
I mean, I don't think that they have any authority to change any ordinances because they're not legislators, but it's basically an advisory body.

865
01:16:17,169 --> 01:16:27,411
Yeah, I mean, I would think that, you know, especially, you know, a first review, some of them might be, you know, pretty obvious.

866
01:16:29,037 --> 01:16:36,803
whether they needed to be sunset or have some sort of a revision or whatever.

867
01:16:38,384 --> 01:16:55,296
But then some others where you get into the weeds, I'm sure that there would be somebody like we have the Collins Center who's steering us in the right direction, that there would be somebody

868
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,111
steering them in the right direction too.

869
01:16:58,812 --> 01:17:05,716
Which would be the city solicitor based on the way this particular Melrose's section is written anyway.

870
01:17:05,736 --> 01:17:14,902
Do we have any motions on this or do we want to?

871
01:17:18,584 --> 01:17:24,888
Can I make a motion that we defer to the Collins Center for advice and to

872
01:17:27,462 --> 01:17:48,771
craft something that we can, you know, possibly vote on down the line, because I like to do a little more, kind of find out a little bit more about it, because I'm not prepared to vote on this, because I really don't know, you know, what the current process is for review of ordinances.

873
01:17:48,851 --> 01:17:52,953
Is this something that, you know, we're already doing by ordinance?

874
01:17:53,645 --> 01:17:54,265
We don't even know.

875
01:17:54,826 --> 01:17:57,927
Well, the Collins Center won't craft.

876
01:17:58,148 --> 01:18:01,049
They can craft this if we tell them what we want.

877
01:18:01,489 --> 01:18:04,671
They're not going to say you should have a periodic review.

878
01:18:04,711 --> 01:18:08,353
They'll just give us information, but they won't draft anything.

879
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:12,836
I mean, they might give us a memo on how common is it.

880
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:14,517
I mean, is that's what you're looking for?

881
01:18:14,697 --> 01:18:18,999
Like, how common is it for communities to have periodic reviews of ordinances?

882
01:18:19,379 --> 01:18:20,320
How does it usually work?

883
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:32,394
Well, I kind of like to know if we have it now before before, like, what does the city council do now with ordinances that are outdated?

884
01:18:32,554 --> 01:18:38,842
Is there already a process that just needs to be kind of incorporated into the charter?

885
01:18:39,485 --> 01:18:41,126
I don't think they're doing anything.

886
01:18:41,146 --> 01:19:06,377
I don't think anything's been done in quite some time because I think that's part of the governing agenda of the current city council that has to go through, you know, as I said, each standing committee is going to be going through ordinances that pertain to, you know, the purview of that particular standing committee.

887
01:19:07,558 --> 01:19:23,265
And I think it's the first, I could be wrong and I don't recall anything in our two and a half page charter regarding ordinance review, but I don't think anything's been done in quite some time.

888
01:19:23,445 --> 01:19:32,489
Otherwise, I don't think that it would be one of the priorities of this current city council.

889
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:34,429
Who's doing something.

890
01:19:36,546 --> 01:19:42,171
Yeah, they are they're they're hoping to have gone through all of the ordinances, you know, in their 2 year term.

891
01:19:44,013 --> 01:19:46,855
And part of the reason they, they change from.

892
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:54,482
Weekly to every other week, so they could do this kind of work and subcommittees is that.

893
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:56,324
Is that right?

894
01:19:56,724 --> 01:19:57,705
I'm right.

895
01:19:58,143 --> 01:20:07,729
Yeah, that's it and actually, you know, I've mentioned this governing agenda now a couple of times and when the city clerk put out the June schedule.

896
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:12,332
For city council meetings, I believe it's on the.

897
01:20:13,513 --> 01:20:17,876
18th of June at 6 o'clock, which is next Tuesday, I think.

898
01:20:19,892 --> 01:20:30,356
The counselors are conducting a committee of the whole to look at the governing agenda, which includes a lot of things, not just this ordinance review.

899
01:20:31,056 --> 01:20:36,378
It includes a lot of the work of the overall body in the standing committees.

900
01:20:36,838 --> 01:20:40,760
And I think it's basically, it's been six months now.

901
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:44,221
I think it's a check-in to see how this governing agenda is working.

902
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:47,162
So it'll be interesting to see what they say about

903
01:20:48,153 --> 01:20:50,294
any ordinance review.

904
01:20:50,974 --> 01:20:55,336
I don't think that they've, I mean, I watch a fair amount of subcommittee meetings.

905
01:20:55,816 --> 01:20:57,337
I haven't seen anything come up yet.

906
01:20:57,817 --> 01:21:01,518
They've been doing other things, but be interesting to see what they say.

907
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:09,361
And that said, this, if we put this in the charter, this is an ordinance review by a body that's not the city council.

908
01:21:09,441 --> 01:21:13,903
So it's basically like another set of eyes on the city ordinances.

909
01:21:15,444 --> 01:21:15,664
Ron.

910
01:21:16,909 --> 01:21:25,893
Can we, I motioned a table, the discussion and asking her opinion from the call center and how other cities and towns and their analysis of this amendment.

911
01:21:27,614 --> 01:21:28,675
Okay.

912
01:21:29,615 --> 01:21:30,616
Anybody want to second that?

913
01:21:31,516 --> 01:21:32,417
I'll second it.

914
01:21:33,397 --> 01:21:33,737
Okay.

915
01:21:34,678 --> 01:21:35,058
Ron.

916
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:38,539
Ron says yes.

917
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:41,361
Eunice.

918
01:21:42,421 --> 01:21:43,282
Eunice says yes.

919
01:21:45,263 --> 01:21:45,623
Anthony.

920
01:21:49,069 --> 01:21:49,830
I say yes.

921
01:21:51,652 --> 01:21:52,212
Danielle?

922
01:21:52,973 --> 01:21:53,193
Yes.

923
01:21:54,514 --> 01:21:54,854
Aubrey?

924
01:21:56,195 --> 01:22:00,118
No, I'm okay moving forward.

925
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:06,484
I'm also a no, because I'm also okay moving forward, but the motion carries.

926
01:22:08,812 --> 01:22:19,199
So that means, so that's leading me into the next, so we have about a half an hour left and there are some other, I know that there's some issues that people want to discuss in Articles 5, 9, and 10.

927
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:23,382
Our next scheduled meeting would be 4th of July.

928
01:22:23,462 --> 01:22:25,023
We will not have a meeting then.

929
01:22:25,364 --> 01:22:29,867
My hope, well, was that we would finalize things tonight

930
01:22:31,543 --> 01:22:35,765
and the Collins Center said they will take a few weeks.

931
01:22:36,286 --> 01:22:43,930
Then within the next few weeks, I would get a draft charter to everybody on the committee from the Collins Center.

932
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:54,015
Then we would reconvene in August and September to go over that draft with the Collins Center and finalize it.

933
01:22:54,996 --> 01:22:59,278
Since we're not going to finish tonight, I'm going to propose that we have another meeting in June.

934
01:23:03,194 --> 01:23:04,478
What do we have left to vote on?

935
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:05,901
Well, we have this.

936
01:23:05,921 --> 01:23:10,514
We have this that we just voted on getting more information on.

937
01:23:12,265 --> 01:23:24,974
And potentially whatever, I know that there are some, I was about to ask what other areas of those three articles that we haven't extensively gone through and drafted that people wanted to talk about.

938
01:23:25,034 --> 01:23:26,255
And I know that there are some issues.

939
01:23:26,936 --> 01:23:35,502
So we could look at that and possibly finish it in half an hour, but we definitely won't get the ordinance review taken care of because we just voted to ask for more information on it.

940
01:23:36,623 --> 01:23:43,570
I mean, I I've added several things in the margin for article 9 and I get and.

941
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:50,477
Article 1 appears to be mostly definitions that are, you know.

942
01:23:51,658 --> 01:23:58,906
Pretty boilerplate yeah, but article 5, I'm not quite sure what to make of that.

943
01:24:02,034 --> 01:24:08,420
What you've got there, can you make it a little bit bigger, Melva, please?

944
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:12,644
Really basically has sections 5-1 and 5-2.

945
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:23,916
But in going through and looking at a number of other charters, they break down that section with a lot of,

946
01:24:25,517 --> 01:24:42,789
the various city departments and they talk about scope and responsibilities and so forth of the city clerk, the Department of Public Works, Department of Elections.

947
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:49,213
City clerk, I think we addressed in Article 2.

948
01:24:49,794 --> 01:24:52,636
I'm just talking about what I've seen.

949
01:24:55,375 --> 01:25:01,041
Um, you know, and and they get into some some boards to some of the other.

950
01:25:01,061 --> 01:25:09,650
I was I did some research over the last couple of days, but I was more focusing on article 9 than anything else.

951
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:11,432
And I've added a lot of things there.

952
01:25:12,673 --> 01:25:13,714
To look at, but.

953
01:25:14,595 --> 01:25:17,856
Kind of starting to glance at section article 5.

954
01:25:19,337 --> 01:25:22,598
I mean, we can keep it as minimalistic as this is.

955
01:25:23,538 --> 01:25:26,339
Or we can take a look at, you know.

956
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,660
Some of the others that are out there that, you know.

957
01:25:31,641 --> 01:25:33,741
Do things a lot more broadly so.

958
01:25:35,502 --> 01:25:37,523
You know, I don't know where we go with that.

959
01:25:39,183 --> 01:25:41,904
You know, different communities do different things.

960
01:25:43,085 --> 01:25:43,425
Yeah.

961
01:25:45,864 --> 01:26:01,328
I guess I think my preference would be to keep it minimal and general and not define the bodies in the charter, because we know that changing the charter is a pretty big deal.

962
01:26:03,568 --> 01:26:12,591
But I guess maybe that's another question for the Collins Center is, why do some communities do it one way and some communities do it the other?

963
01:26:14,955 --> 01:26:18,660
Pro or con to doing it one way or the other.

964
01:26:23,445 --> 01:26:27,410
Yeah, I think the con is that you can't change it easily when it's in the charter.

965
01:26:29,853 --> 01:26:34,279
Right, but a number of communities actually do go pretty far into depth.

966
01:26:35,025 --> 01:26:35,325
Right.

967
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:38,526
I believe the three that they gave us don't.

968
01:26:38,607 --> 01:26:47,650
And I think that, so I think that they, that, you know, and when they gave us the example to sort of template, they called it the generic modern charter.

969
01:26:47,730 --> 01:27:01,376
So my understanding is that we're looking at, is that they're, they're giving us sort of the most, the most recent kind of modern charter, which is,

970
01:27:04,496 --> 01:27:15,867
maybe more broad so that it defines things, but it gives the electeds leeway to change those departments if they need to be changed or whatever.

971
01:27:17,369 --> 01:27:22,854
That's my understanding, but... No, I see your point.

972
01:27:23,355 --> 01:27:23,495
Yeah.

973
01:27:26,117 --> 01:27:37,584
Does anybody else have any thought about this particular section, which the example that we have, it is very short and it's pretty boilerplate language.

974
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:50,772
Obviously, we would change Alderman, that was from another charter, but as opposed to the other option of

975
01:27:52,614 --> 01:28:03,937
defining different agencies within this section, which would require a good bit of work on our part to look at, you know, and which ones would we define?

976
01:28:04,537 --> 01:28:06,618
That's the other question, if we did that.

977
01:28:07,618 --> 01:28:08,178
Aubrey?

978
01:28:09,599 --> 01:28:22,122
I'm okay with it as is, and I appreciate the phrases in here where it says subject to express prohibitions in general law or other places in this charter.

979
01:28:22,874 --> 01:28:23,154
Mm-hmm.

980
01:28:30,743 --> 01:28:32,045
Okay, any other thoughts?

981
01:28:39,353 --> 01:28:41,255
Any, just any, I mean,

982
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:59,128
Do we want to just say the call-in center, we're good with the boilerplate language of Article 5, or do we want to explore more deeply defining different agencies in this section?

983
01:29:02,229 --> 01:29:05,771
I move that we just give it to the call-in center now.

984
01:29:07,212 --> 01:29:08,092
I second that.

985
01:29:09,653 --> 01:29:09,773
OK.

986
01:29:11,997 --> 01:29:14,858
with the amendment that we take out the board of aldermen and put in.

987
01:29:14,878 --> 01:29:14,958
Yeah.

988
01:29:15,478 --> 01:29:15,959
Yeah.

989
01:29:16,219 --> 01:29:17,779
Yeah.

990
01:29:17,879 --> 01:29:31,145
So the motion, uh, tell me if we're on, if this represents your motion, um, to ask Colin century to draft article five using standard language.

991
01:29:32,745 --> 01:29:33,026
Yeah.

992
01:29:33,106 --> 01:29:33,366
I'm sorry.

993
01:29:33,386 --> 01:29:34,306
Is that also article one?

994
01:29:40,545 --> 01:29:41,246
That's right.

995
01:29:41,406 --> 01:29:42,987
We can add Article 1 to that, too.

996
01:29:43,247 --> 01:29:43,387
Yes.

997
01:29:43,407 --> 01:29:45,108
Does that include Aubrey's statement?

998
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:46,610
Is that in here on Section 5?

999
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:48,591
I'm too lazy to look at it.

1000
01:29:48,971 --> 01:29:50,532
Yeah, it's already on there.

1001
01:29:50,672 --> 01:29:50,953
Okay.

1002
01:29:51,093 --> 01:29:52,154
Then that's what I would do.

1003
01:29:52,174 --> 01:30:00,059
1 and 5, I move to accept it using the template and move it to the comments section.

1004
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:00,279
Okay.

1005
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:01,600
Ron?

1006
01:30:03,322 --> 01:30:03,642
Yes.

1007
01:30:04,623 --> 01:30:05,043
Anthony?

1008
01:30:05,723 --> 01:30:05,964
Yes.

1009
01:30:06,544 --> 01:30:06,924
Aubrey?

1010
01:30:07,645 --> 01:30:07,825
Yes.

1011
01:30:08,335 --> 01:30:08,655
Eunice?

1012
01:30:09,336 --> 01:30:09,576
No.

1013
01:30:10,978 --> 01:30:11,478
Danielle?

1014
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:14,241
Yes.

1015
01:30:14,381 --> 01:30:15,022
I say yes.

1016
01:30:16,323 --> 01:30:17,624
Okay, great.

1017
01:30:17,905 --> 01:30:19,326
So that leaves us with Article 9.

1018
01:30:21,728 --> 01:30:30,677
We've already looked at, I mean, this is all very boilerplate language, but I guess,

1019
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:34,659
We looked at the charter review body.

1020
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,079
We've already taken care of that.

1021
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:40,341
And so what I had asked people to do was to look this over and bring up any issues.

1022
01:30:40,821 --> 01:30:43,142
So now's your time to bring them up.

1023
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:49,744
Well, maybe Eunice can take a moment to explain her notes on the side there.

1024
01:30:49,764 --> 01:30:50,464
I'd like to hear.

1025
01:30:50,524 --> 01:30:52,805
Yeah, since I can't see that, I'm trying to.

1026
01:30:55,286 --> 01:30:56,466
Can you tell me what section?

1027
01:30:56,506 --> 01:30:57,587
And I'll pull up the section.

1028
01:30:59,232 --> 01:31:02,796
I'm kind of all over the map and it was really hard for me to.

1029
01:31:03,577 --> 01:31:11,366
I get the way this seems to work is that if you have more than 1 thing to say about a section, you can't kind of like.

1030
01:31:12,267 --> 01:31:17,013
You know, you have to find a different place to put your little comment.

1031
01:31:18,696 --> 01:31:21,059
So, can I propose something?

1032
01:31:21,079 --> 01:31:22,741
Sure.

1033
01:31:23,001 --> 01:31:25,584
So, we're going to have to have another meeting in June.

1034
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:29,329
Where we're going to look at the periodic review of ordinances.

1035
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:34,055
My proposal is that we use our next, say, 10 minutes to.

1036
01:31:35,258 --> 01:31:50,182
get down on paper what sections in addition to the periodic review of ordinances that we want to look at, study, and learn about so that we can decide on them at the next meeting we're going to have in a couple of weeks.

1037
01:31:51,202 --> 01:31:51,883
Does that make sense?

1038
01:31:52,743 --> 01:31:53,043
Okay.

1039
01:31:53,343 --> 01:31:53,743
Sure.

1040
01:31:54,163 --> 01:32:00,665
There were some sections that are in there that I wanted

1041
01:32:01,355 --> 01:32:05,139
For the discussion on and then after having gone through.

1042
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:13,887
You know, 20 or 30 other charters, there were some sections that I plucked out of other charters that don't seem to be in there yet.

1043
01:32:13,987 --> 01:32:16,630
But I would like to consider adding.

1044
01:32:17,581 --> 01:32:19,482
So that's kind of where I was.

1045
01:32:19,942 --> 01:32:28,107
How about you tell us which sections you want to look at so we can, so we have, we're going to, we're going to look at section nine, four.

1046
01:32:28,127 --> 01:32:29,627
So that's ordinances.

1047
01:32:30,388 --> 01:32:35,991
I can tell you what, and I'm sorry if my back's to you, but I can see it better on desktop here.

1048
01:32:36,031 --> 01:32:44,095
I can tell you of the sections that are there, what I would like for the discussion on, and then tell you what I would like added.

1049
01:32:44,715 --> 01:32:45,035
Okay.

1050
01:32:45,676 --> 01:32:45,876
So.

1051
01:32:46,839 --> 01:32:52,200
Section 9-3, which is rules and regulations.

1052
01:32:55,521 --> 01:33:00,882
So we did the ordinances part, we did the periodic review of the charter.

1053
01:33:03,043 --> 01:33:11,965
Section 9-6, which is proceed multi-member bodies.

1054
01:33:21,048 --> 01:33:24,269
98, computation of time.

1055
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:33,891
Some of these are just small things and other things are not so small.

1056
01:33:33,911 --> 01:33:38,012
99, also affirmations.

1057
01:33:43,894 --> 01:33:44,194
That was.

1058
01:33:48,089 --> 01:33:51,532
OK, so go ahead.

1059
01:33:51,812 --> 01:34:08,444
And then I did find in Framingham, they had a section in Article 9 about public comment.

1060
01:34:08,504 --> 01:34:10,125
So I'd like to take a look at that.

1061
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:10,185
OK.

1062
01:34:18,676 --> 01:34:25,821
So maybe we can cross one of those off the list right now if you want to.

1063
01:34:25,861 --> 01:34:28,883
Like, for instance, computation of time is probably a quickie.

1064
01:34:28,903 --> 01:34:35,748
Yeah, and I'm trying to figure out what I tried to say about that.

1065
01:34:35,768 --> 01:34:40,672
Oh, OK, I think that was

1066
01:34:45,543 --> 01:34:50,585
something there that needs to be defined and aligned with the definition of days in Article 1.

1067
01:34:51,506 --> 01:34:51,766
Right.

1068
01:34:52,186 --> 01:35:04,651
So one of the things the Collins Center does when they review our drafts and then draft the other articles is that they'll make sure they'll look for consistency of language and things like that.

1069
01:35:04,691 --> 01:35:10,933
So I don't think we have to worry so much about that because we're so fortunate to have the Collins Center.

1070
01:35:13,262 --> 01:35:15,163
basically being a good editor that way.

1071
01:35:15,183 --> 01:35:22,205
Wait, can I just ask, does that mean we can cross that off the list?

1072
01:35:23,585 --> 01:35:23,985
Oh, yeah.

1073
01:35:24,325 --> 01:35:28,126
Okay.

1074
01:35:28,146 --> 01:35:29,147
Go ahead.

1075
01:35:29,167 --> 01:35:36,569
Then one other piece that I would like to have some discussion on, and I put something in

1076
01:35:39,002 --> 01:35:42,425
I think it's our miscellaneous folder that you can go through and look at.

1077
01:35:42,445 --> 01:36:03,325
I put a lot of what I researched in our miscellaneous folder on a lot of these different topics, but ethics and conflict of interest and so forth, some language about that.

1078
01:36:05,116 --> 01:36:08,500
So let's, I'm just trying to call that up.

1079
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,302
So it's a document in.

1080
01:36:10,322 --> 01:36:16,908
Yeah, I think it's.

1081
01:36:17,269 --> 01:36:19,451
That might be covered by Mass General Logins.

1082
01:36:21,433 --> 01:36:23,335
It could be, but I found a whole lot of stuff.

1083
01:36:23,615 --> 01:36:25,077
I have to take an annual training.

1084
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:29,642
What is the name of the document?

1085
01:36:30,423 --> 01:36:31,284
Oh, Article 1, 5, 9, 10.

1086
01:36:32,044 --> 01:36:32,465
Okay.

1087
01:36:32,645 --> 01:36:36,329
Oh, Phyllis is back.

1088
01:36:36,669 --> 01:36:37,190
Hi, Phyllis.

1089
01:36:39,192 --> 01:36:44,958
Okay, so what you've done here is you've put a bunch of examples of other charters.

1090
01:36:45,819 --> 01:36:46,179
Right.

1091
01:36:46,419 --> 01:36:48,081
Okay.

1092
01:36:48,762 --> 01:36:49,542
Okay, so

1093
01:36:52,384 --> 01:36:56,888
Right now, what I have is that we can all have access to that document.

1094
01:36:57,749 --> 01:37:09,438
And we're going to have another meeting in June to discuss sections 9-3, 9-4, 9-6, and 9-9, and also a question of whether to add a section on public comment.

1095
01:37:10,259 --> 01:37:10,739
And ethics.

1096
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:13,522
Ethics and conflict of interest.

1097
01:37:15,103 --> 01:37:15,383
Yeah.

1098
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:19,366
I'm guessing that's, I think I agree with Aubrey that that's in state law.

1099
01:37:22,425 --> 01:37:24,147
I'll do a little bit more digging on that.

1100
01:37:25,528 --> 01:37:25,849
Okay.

1101
01:37:28,631 --> 01:37:30,433
I don't know.

1102
01:37:30,894 --> 01:37:40,644
Eunice, do you think your questions or issues on any of those are basic enough that we could do them in 5-10 minutes?

1103
01:37:41,384 --> 01:37:44,848
Can we cross one of them off the list?

1104
01:37:53,313 --> 01:37:54,474
Oh, wait, you're muted, Eunice.

1105
01:37:57,655 --> 01:37:58,136
Oh, sorry.

1106
01:37:58,156 --> 01:37:59,096
That's okay.

1107
01:37:59,997 --> 01:38:06,761
Under multi-member bodies, I'd like to add a residency section.

1108
01:38:08,121 --> 01:38:13,404
Okay.

1109
01:38:13,464 --> 01:38:16,506
Right now, multi-member bodies is 9-6.

1110
01:38:17,006 --> 01:38:19,788
So right now, I mean, this particular,

1111
01:38:21,593 --> 01:38:22,453
Let me just call it up.

1112
01:38:22,573 --> 01:38:25,314
The example that we have is Melrose.

1113
01:38:25,534 --> 01:38:30,296
But the question for us is, what specific things do we want in that section?

1114
01:38:30,556 --> 01:38:39,539
So this is pretty boilerplate, this section A.

1115
01:38:43,778 --> 01:38:46,719
And so which section were you?

1116
01:38:46,739 --> 01:38:49,901
I'm sorry, Eunice, can you repeat what you said you wanted to look at?

1117
01:38:50,241 --> 01:38:53,122
There is not a residency section at the moment.

1118
01:38:53,842 --> 01:39:05,547
So I have over in the side there, we need to add a section on residency and then copy it and paste it from somewhere else, Fall River.

1119
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:06,588
OK.

1120
01:39:07,548 --> 01:39:11,990
Or we just decide that if the committee decides they want to do that,

1121
01:39:15,753 --> 01:39:19,656
then we can just tell the call center that we want to add that.

1122
01:39:20,797 --> 01:39:26,441
So basically what you want is you want a residency requirement for multi-member bodies.

1123
01:39:27,242 --> 01:39:27,642
Correct.

1124
01:39:28,122 --> 01:39:32,466
Okay, so resident as opposed because we've had this discussion resident versus voter.

1125
01:39:32,486 --> 01:39:33,366
Well, resident as in

1126
01:39:43,413 --> 01:39:47,435
To be a member of a multi-member body, you have to be a resident of Medford.

1127
01:39:47,776 --> 01:40:06,486
It's come up in the past, and I brought this to the attention of the mayor a couple of years ago about a particular individual sitting on one of our boards that had been a Medford resident, moved out of the city, continued on in her role on the particular board,

1128
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:10,594
making decisions for Medford when she didn't live in Medford anymore.

1129
01:40:11,074 --> 01:40:21,326
When I brought it up to the mayor, I was told nothing she can do, nothing in the charter, says he had to be a resident to be, you know, a member of

1130
01:40:23,207 --> 01:40:26,449
you know, a board, so... Okay.

1131
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:39,578
You know, and I see a note from Frances in the chat, because she, remember, we had a question for her, and she heard her name, but she couldn't unmute, but now she maybe can unmute, and I think our question was related to this, right, for Frances?

1132
01:40:40,058 --> 01:40:41,759
I think Anthony had that question, yeah.

1133
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,262
Was it... About commissions and boards.

1134
01:40:45,922 --> 01:40:50,325
Yes, something about could city employees vote on the commissions and boards.

1135
01:40:51,826 --> 01:40:54,829
I don't have voting rights on the commissions and boards.

1136
01:40:54,969 --> 01:40:57,831
I'm a liaison to the commissions and boards.

1137
01:40:58,331 --> 01:41:06,998
But if you are on the commission or the board in the same manners that you have been appointed, then you would have voting rights.

1138
01:41:07,898 --> 01:41:18,947
So the question was, and I brought up the example of the Human Rights Commission.

1139
01:41:21,638 --> 01:41:28,181
where I believe Chief Buckley is a member of that board, and I believe he has voting rights.

1140
01:41:28,801 --> 01:41:42,066
Chief Buckley is a commissioner and does have voting rights, but also that same commission also has a very strange ordinance that says something like the chair of the board does not get to vote.

1141
01:41:44,295 --> 01:41:51,746
then these things precede me, but Chief Buckley is considered a commissioner on that board, but I'm not considered a commissioner.

1142
01:41:53,648 --> 01:41:55,892
And my knowledge, the chief does not live in Medford.

1143
01:41:56,853 --> 01:42:07,642
And we did discuss this earlier when we talked about, you know, it's just, I agree we should have restrictions, but there are scenarios that will force us to not have a paint with such a broad brush.

1144
01:42:08,403 --> 01:42:18,531
If the police chief has a voting right on a board, or if the building commission has a voting right in the building department, and he doesn't, there's no rule that says he has to live in the city.

1145
01:42:19,452 --> 01:42:23,996
He could live in Melrose, but still do his job and must be on that board anyway.

1146
01:42:24,036 --> 01:42:25,517
So I think we really have to look at that.

1147
01:42:26,526 --> 01:42:30,808
And some people have to be on the boards because of the scope and rules of their job.

1148
01:42:31,368 --> 01:42:46,834
I mean, let's since we're talking about Chief Buckley, if Chief Buckley was on the, I don't know, another board that really didn't have anything to let's say, do with like a policing role, that kind of stuff, then yeah, I think that you would question it.

1149
01:42:46,894 --> 01:42:51,736
But the Building Commissioner being on the zoning board, I think that's important.

1150
01:42:51,776 --> 01:42:52,477
That's critical.

1151
01:42:52,957 --> 01:42:55,938
Who else is going to provide the legal guidance that's needed?

1152
01:42:56,648 --> 01:42:56,888
Right.

1153
01:42:58,689 --> 01:42:59,950
Aubrey, did you have your hand up?

1154
01:43:01,230 --> 01:43:11,295
Just to add that I think in sections where we feel we do have specific references to either resident or voter in sections where we think that it matters.

1155
01:43:13,436 --> 01:43:13,696
Yes.

1156
01:43:17,738 --> 01:43:22,180
For particular bodies, like for instance, yeah, so.

1157
01:43:25,185 --> 01:43:39,377
So Eunice, I mean, did you want, so we've had a discussion about should we add the requirement that you're talking about in section 96, the uniform procedures governing multiple member bodies.

1158
01:43:41,499 --> 01:43:46,583
Do you want to make a motion or?

1159
01:43:47,688 --> 01:44:08,634
Well, I think in listening to the discussion and things like that, I think there are circumstances where, you know, and maybe we can finesse it a bit, where it's perfectly appropriate and right for somebody who may

1160
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:33,456
offer a particular expertise or role or something, you know, and I'm just sort of, you know, thinking out loud here where they're being a member of a particular board and not a resident of the city is not only appropriate, but.

1161
01:44:34,708 --> 01:44:54,019
essential, maybe required by ordinance or at least essential versus, you know, if I sign up for the garden committee because I like to, you know, plant roses and all of a sudden I, you know, move to Wakefield, should I still be a member of Medford's garden committee?

1162
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:57,021
You know, I don't think so.

1163
01:44:57,741 --> 01:44:58,442
Me personally.

1164
01:45:00,003 --> 01:45:01,804
You know, I think that

1165
01:45:03,896 --> 01:45:22,594
people that are serving on these boards and commissions because they might have a particular interest in the topic should relieve themselves of a role on a board or commission when they leave the city.

1166
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:27,198
It's somebody like the building commissioner or the chief or somebody that

1167
01:45:29,862 --> 01:45:35,505
offers us a particular expertise or by ordinance, then I think that's a very different story.

1168
01:45:36,765 --> 01:45:58,596
And I think as far as being a resident versus being a voter, I would argue that everybody should be, everybody except those specific instances, like the building commissioner or whatever, should be a resident.

1169
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:10,809
in order to participate in anything regarding how Medford operates.

1170
01:46:11,690 --> 01:46:21,458
Whether you're a voter or not, I think, you know, could be up for discussion, but, you know, you should at least be a resident of the community.

1171
01:46:22,379 --> 01:46:22,759
Okay.

1172
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,161
Aubrey, did you want to?

1173
01:46:24,181 --> 01:46:25,301
Can I say something?

1174
01:46:25,742 --> 01:46:26,923
Yeah, Aubrey and then Anthony.

1175
01:46:30,526 --> 01:46:37,990
I think I said this earlier and I think it applies here to that.

1176
01:46:39,431 --> 01:46:45,675
To be on these, I think there is some hurdle to like an application or some kind of appointment that needs to happen.

1177
01:46:45,715 --> 01:46:52,218
So it's not just you want to and then you get to and so I'm trusting in that process to be.

1178
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:58,302
To make good decisions about who ends up on these boards.

1179
01:46:59,861 --> 01:47:00,622
Thank you, Aubrey.

1180
01:47:00,682 --> 01:47:04,144
So Anthony, and then we got to wrap this up, Anthony.

1181
01:47:05,205 --> 01:47:27,343
Just to kind of chime in with that, if you just look at like a commission, like the public health commission, where it may be difficult to get a doctor or a nurse practitioner, you know, who's a Methodist resident willing to serve on a board like that, if there's someone with expertise that could benefit the community,

1182
01:47:28,288 --> 01:47:38,500
Uh, you know, I, I think that, you know, residency is not a, is, is not, you know, necessarily in the best interest of the community.

1183
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:43,806
It's if we have people who, who can, you know, serve.

1184
01:47:44,391 --> 01:47:51,854
The city in a willing to, you know, these are these most of these are non paid positions, and some of them are very important.

1185
01:47:51,894 --> 01:47:59,237
Like, you know, the director of public health, I think it's Dr platelets who happens to be a resident now, but, you know.

1186
01:47:59,957 --> 01:48:11,925
There may be other times where, you know, a local doctor isn't available or something with, you know, the environment where you need, you know, someone with a real specific scientific background.

1187
01:48:11,945 --> 01:48:15,507
I don't think it needs to be in the charter.

1188
01:48:15,827 --> 01:48:22,872
I think the mayor can, you know, try to get, like Audrey said, you know, the appropriate people.

1189
01:48:22,932 --> 01:48:29,456
But when they have an expertise, just because somebody leaves the city, you know, we shouldn't lose that experience.

1190
01:48:29,929 --> 01:48:47,880
and expertise, you know, maybe, you know, they can be asked, you know, if there's someone else, you know, to, you know, not to renew the term, but I don't know, I think we should, you know, I don't think we're overflowing with, you know, expertise in City Hall right now.

1191
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:53,464
I think we should try to, you know, keep, you know, what we have.

1192
01:48:54,895 --> 01:48:55,796
Okay, thank you.

1193
01:48:55,957 --> 01:48:57,319
So we've had a good discussion.

1194
01:48:57,339 --> 01:49:02,287
Eunice, do you want to make a motion or how do we want, do we want to?

1195
01:49:04,779 --> 01:49:10,963
To just go to something that Aubrey said a minute ago about, you know, people applying for these positions.

1196
01:49:11,584 --> 01:49:30,758
My sort of point in all of this wasn't so much that, you know, although I do see Anthony's point about the expertise part, you know, so much about people, you know, somebody from, you know, Wakefield applying to be on one of our boards, it was more of a,

1197
01:49:32,218 --> 01:49:44,572
somebody who is a current Medford resident and then leaves the city for whatever reason and chooses to, does not step down.

1198
01:49:45,813 --> 01:49:47,675
So they were originally a resident.

1199
01:49:51,831 --> 01:49:57,173
I mean, clearly this hasn't gotten any traction.

1200
01:49:57,353 --> 01:50:03,396
So it clearly seems to be the will of the group not to include this.

1201
01:50:03,576 --> 01:50:05,256
So I'll just leave it at that then.

1202
01:50:05,276 --> 01:50:09,138
I mean, you can make a motion.

1203
01:50:09,158 --> 01:50:10,559
We can vote on it.

1204
01:50:10,579 --> 01:50:11,499
It's up to you.

1205
01:50:12,019 --> 01:50:13,280
I'm clearly outnumbered.

1206
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:18,082
So it clearly is something that most people aren't interested in.

1207
01:50:20,288 --> 01:50:21,028
solve the idea.

1208
01:50:21,489 --> 01:50:21,809
Okay.

1209
01:50:22,189 --> 01:50:23,389
Was there anything else?

1210
01:50:23,529 --> 01:50:24,770
Just a point of information.

1211
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:26,130
I think we're all interested.

1212
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:27,751
I think we've expressed opinions.

1213
01:50:28,231 --> 01:50:30,272
And I think that it's very different.

1214
01:50:30,332 --> 01:50:31,793
I understand what you're trying to do.

1215
01:50:31,873 --> 01:50:33,813
It's just it's very difficult to do.

1216
01:50:34,334 --> 01:50:38,175
But I think that, you know, everybody is trying to do the right thing.

1217
01:50:38,215 --> 01:50:40,416
And this just maybe may not go.

1218
01:50:42,677 --> 01:50:44,698
I just think it's too strong to ask.

1219
01:50:45,564 --> 01:50:48,066
Yeah, I think that we limit ourselves sometimes.

1220
01:50:48,086 --> 01:50:51,608
I'm almost in full agreement with you.

1221
01:50:51,628 --> 01:50:53,910
I would love everyone to be from the city.

1222
01:50:54,771 --> 01:51:00,555
But realistically speaking, I think we miss good opportunities when we do limit it to that.

1223
01:51:01,195 --> 01:51:09,101
Even though I agree with you on that part, Eunice, I would hope that everyone we needed could be from the city, but I don't think that happens.

1224
01:51:09,702 --> 01:51:14,346
And I think the intent is for these bodies to be filled with Medford residents.

1225
01:51:14,406 --> 01:51:18,570
So in the case that it wouldn't happen, it would be rare.

1226
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:21,192
But yeah, so.

1227
01:51:22,013 --> 01:51:22,393
OK.

1228
01:51:22,853 --> 01:51:23,934
Was there anything else?

1229
01:51:24,174 --> 01:51:29,139
We could say, as best as possible, if this could be filled by a resident.

1230
01:51:29,379 --> 01:51:34,643
I mean, we could make a statement that we would prefer Medford residents, if possible.

1231
01:51:34,944 --> 01:51:35,844
We could do that.

1232
01:51:38,872 --> 01:51:42,095
Do we want to vote on that?

1233
01:51:43,496 --> 01:52:03,315
I would make a motion to include a section on residency to state that wherever possible, positions on multi-member boards and commissions be filled by Medford residents.

1234
01:52:05,325 --> 01:52:06,786
Second that, wherever possible.

1235
01:52:07,026 --> 01:52:09,187
Wherever possible is very vague.

1236
01:52:09,207 --> 01:52:11,968
I don't, I mean, you know.

1237
01:52:12,769 --> 01:52:13,869
Is it really, Melva?

1238
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:16,430
I would like some information on that.

1239
01:52:16,631 --> 01:52:17,971
And I mean that sincerely.

1240
01:52:18,812 --> 01:52:21,493
It sounds vague to me, but I don't know what it means.

1241
01:52:21,553 --> 01:52:26,055
Like if I read that, I would be like, I don't know what that exactly means, but I mean.

1242
01:52:26,075 --> 01:52:33,899
How about a majority of commissions and boards will have a majority of

1243
01:52:34,969 --> 01:52:37,452
could be comprised of a majority of Memphis residents.

1244
01:52:38,093 --> 01:52:42,437
So they may be like more than two from outside, but you know, the majority will be.

1245
01:52:43,518 --> 01:52:45,440
I'm sorry, I just, I really do it.

1246
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:46,701
We do have to end in two minutes.

1247
01:52:46,781 --> 01:52:53,828
So let's keep this on the list and let's put it, let's finish this discussion at our next meeting.

1248
01:52:55,895 --> 01:52:58,757
Okay, so let's schedule that.

1249
01:52:59,337 --> 01:53:02,038
I would like to propose that today is June 6th.

1250
01:53:02,398 --> 01:53:04,719
I would like to propose June 20th.

1251
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:06,940
How are people with that?

1252
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:07,000
20th.

1253
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:09,281
To wrap everything up?

1254
01:53:10,341 --> 01:53:11,782
That's a Thursday evening, right?

1255
01:53:12,422 --> 01:53:17,144
Yeah, or next week.

1256
01:53:17,304 --> 01:53:18,025
We could do June 13th.

1257
01:53:20,557 --> 01:53:29,541
Yeah, I will just note for next week that, you know, Tuesday night, the mayor is presenting her budget at the city council meeting Tuesday night.

1258
01:53:30,222 --> 01:53:32,843
Okay, but not on Thursday, right?

1259
01:53:32,863 --> 01:53:35,364
As far as I know, not on Thursday.

1260
01:53:35,644 --> 01:53:37,365
Yeah, I'd go for the 13th.

1261
01:53:37,965 --> 01:53:38,265
Okay.

1262
01:53:38,766 --> 01:53:40,386
Do we have other people that can do the 13th?

1263
01:53:40,426 --> 01:53:40,647
Okay.

1264
01:53:43,050 --> 01:53:47,151
You also have a citizen, too, that's here who may want to speak.

1265
01:53:47,171 --> 01:53:47,491
Yeah, I know.

1266
01:53:47,591 --> 01:53:47,771
I know.

1267
01:53:47,812 --> 01:53:48,432
I'm getting to that.

1268
01:53:49,392 --> 01:53:50,752
So I will send out an agenda.

1269
01:53:50,792 --> 01:53:52,793
We will wrap everything up next week.

1270
01:53:52,953 --> 01:53:59,154
And then the other thing we have to talk about is we're going to skip July.

1271
01:54:00,335 --> 01:54:05,736
Once we wrap up next week, you should have a draft charter to read, and then we'll reconvene in August.

1272
01:54:06,276 --> 01:54:09,737
But I do want to form a subcommittee to work on the final report.

1273
01:54:10,335 --> 01:54:14,276
So does anybody at the top of their head want to be involved on that subcommittee?

1274
01:54:18,038 --> 01:54:19,258
I may be away.

1275
01:54:19,678 --> 01:54:20,539
That's my only thing.

1276
01:54:20,819 --> 01:54:21,859
It's a possibility.

1277
01:54:21,879 --> 01:54:27,381
I would like to work on that committee, but I'm not quite sure yet of my this, this.

1278
01:54:27,892 --> 01:54:28,512
this trip.

1279
01:54:28,572 --> 01:54:29,653
So can I let you know?

1280
01:54:30,093 --> 01:54:30,953
I am interested.

1281
01:54:31,473 --> 01:54:32,854
Okay.

1282
01:54:33,134 --> 01:54:34,174
I'll keep you posted.

1283
01:54:34,474 --> 01:54:36,615
Yeah, we'll we'll talk about it again next week.

1284
01:54:37,395 --> 01:54:40,336
Just I just wanted to see if anybody knows they want to do it.

1285
01:54:40,876 --> 01:54:42,096
Yeah, I would be interested.

1286
01:54:43,117 --> 01:54:43,397
Okay.

1287
01:54:44,097 --> 01:54:44,437
Awesome.

1288
01:54:45,117 --> 01:54:47,158
Do we have any members of the public that would like to speak?

1289
01:54:53,822 --> 01:54:54,002
No?

1290
01:54:54,162 --> 01:54:54,422
Okay.

1291
01:54:55,523 --> 01:54:55,823
All right.

1292
01:54:56,323 --> 01:55:03,746
Thank you so much, and I will see you in a week, and we will wrap up these final questions.

1293
01:55:04,006 --> 01:55:04,326
Second?

1294
01:55:04,726 --> 01:55:05,006
Okay.

1295
01:55:05,066 --> 01:55:05,626
All in favor?

1296
01:55:06,326 --> 01:55:06,426
Aye.

1297
01:55:06,466 --> 01:55:07,847
Thanks, everyone.

1298
01:55:07,867 --> 01:55:07,967
Bye.
