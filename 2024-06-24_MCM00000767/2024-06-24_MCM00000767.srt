1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:06,016
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, welcome everyone to the method-started study committee meeting June 6, 2024.

2
00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:12,742
[SPEAKER_07]: First order of business is to accept the minutes from May 16th.

3
00:00:12,822 --> 00:00:14,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Did everyone have a chance to look at them?

4
00:00:14,664 --> 00:00:16,966
[SPEAKER_07]: They're good.

5
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:17,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Move approval.

6
00:00:18,347 --> 00:00:18,588
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

7
00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:19,949
[SPEAKER_07]: I make a motion to approve.

8
00:00:20,549 --> 00:00:20,850
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

9
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,011
[SPEAKER_07]: All in favor?

10
00:00:23,152 --> 00:00:23,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

11
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:24,113
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.

12
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:39,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now we can go right into the composition of the school committee, which we had already decided, but we had the issue of combining wards, and I believe, Ron, you had some things to say about that.

13
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:42,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:49,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the members of the subcommittee are mostly on this call, and I know they've looked at

15
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:52,793
[SPEAKER_01]: the email that had all the details.

16
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:55,373
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just go as quickly as I can.

17
00:00:55,433 --> 00:01:13,860
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the consensus with the group was that rearranging, combining wards was a task that not necessarily was under our purview, but we took on the challenge and I think we did a pretty reasonably good job.

18
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll answer any questions.

19
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,141
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to give you the

20
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:27,383
[SPEAKER_01]: When we initially started working with the numbers, the ward numbers were just out of whack.

21
00:01:27,683 --> 00:01:28,783
[SPEAKER_01]: It was not balanced.

22
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:35,185
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we received the new ward numbers from Milva, the numbers came in line pretty well.

23
00:01:35,205 --> 00:01:36,825
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the map.

24
00:01:44,696 --> 00:01:57,459
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the task was to realize that all this has to do really with is balancing population of voters amongst each district.

25
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,620
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't have anything to do with demographics or makeup in that.

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:04,501
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a totally different thing that we have no authority of doing anyway.

27
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,082
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that anybody would want to handle that.

28
00:02:06,122 --> 00:02:10,203
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have, Milva, do you have the...

29
00:02:12,331 --> 00:02:13,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me post.

30
00:02:13,572 --> 00:02:14,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give me sharing ability?

31
00:02:14,954 --> 00:02:17,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I want to put up the numbers that we were using.

32
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:18,738
[SPEAKER_06]: See if this works.

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:46,965
[SPEAKER_07]: So just, so what I, when I contacted the elections department about the numbers that they provided, what I found out was that they gave us numbers from the most recent census, but the wards are drawn every 10 years and they use the federal census.

34
00:02:47,065 --> 00:02:50,286
[SPEAKER_07]: So those are the numbers that we would be looking at.

35
00:02:50,566 --> 00:02:54,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And they will, and the wards will, they will redo that process in 2031.

36
00:02:54,168 --> 00:02:55,048
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just done in 2020.

37
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:55,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, it's every 10 years.

38
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:09,031
[SPEAKER_07]: So as of now, any awards we combine, no matter which ones we combine, the numbers will work out okay because they were even when they were made.

39
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:10,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?

40
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:16,582
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, it's something that would constantly be adjusted.

41
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:19,903
[SPEAKER_01]: But we took these numbers, which made it a lot easier to come up with.

42
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:24,585
[SPEAKER_01]: We came up with two options just so we had some variety.

43
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:28,746
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the numbers, again, they're pretty well balanced.

44
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:38,349
[SPEAKER_01]: The delta between, you know, you're never going to get equal because there are some awards that are just larger.

45
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:42,471
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the number one goal was to be geographically connected.

46
00:03:43,355 --> 00:03:50,479
[SPEAKER_01]: because it doesn't make sense if we have one ward in North Medford and one ward in South Medford kind of defeats the whole purpose of ward representation.

47
00:03:50,539 --> 00:03:53,300
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wanted to make sure that they were together.

48
00:03:54,381 --> 00:04:00,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And my thought was that not only together, but option one is sequential.

49
00:04:00,644 --> 00:04:07,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So one and two is district one, three and four is district two, five and six is district three, and seven and eight is district four.

50
00:04:08,928 --> 00:04:09,829
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's,

51
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,331
[SPEAKER_01]: it saves a lot of confusion.

52
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:26,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember that in terms of ward representation, we're already giving the voter a new option to have local neighborhood representation by just doing this alone.

53
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:28,735
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, it makes sense.

54
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:37,118
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everybody, I'm just opening it up because we really didn't take a vote on this, but to me, it makes sense one and two, three and four, five and six, seven and eight.

55
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:38,278
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you look at,

56
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:47,042
[SPEAKER_01]: The option two, which is a little bit more balanced that Paulette had worked on, you see that there's a difference of 200 voters, if you look in the Delta column.

57
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:51,945
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a difference of 200 voters, which is negligible in terms of, you know, who it is.

58
00:04:52,025 --> 00:05:03,611
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of having to identify, you know, six and eight, two and three, or I think I'm one and seven, it just made sense to me to do option one.

59
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,154
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll just listen to your comments of what you guys would like to do.

60
00:05:09,157 --> 00:05:10,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Ron, can I ask you a question?

61
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:11,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

62
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you put the map back up?

63
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:15,042
[SPEAKER_08]: I like the visuals.

64
00:05:15,263 --> 00:05:18,305
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to stop sharing because Milva has them.

65
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:19,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'll put the map back.

66
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:29,790
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder if it would be actually more helpful, and I think it's in our school committee's subcommittee folder, the map with the schools pinpointed?

67
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:30,851
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

68
00:05:31,671 --> 00:05:32,872
[SPEAKER_07]: I could try to dig that up.

69
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:49,783
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually, my comment was going to be that I was going to vote for or sort of back option two, because when I looked at that map that you're referring to, Eunice, option two creates a situation where there's at least one school in each district.

70
00:05:52,323 --> 00:05:56,465
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought that that was a plus.

71
00:05:56,806 --> 00:06:12,534
[SPEAKER_07]: The other reason that I liked option two was because when we discussed this before, there were comments about the demographic issues that we have a majority minority ward, which is ward, I believe it's ward seven.

72
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:14,215
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see, I have that here.

73
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:24,061
[SPEAKER_07]: And combining Ward 7 with Ward 1, which I think Option 2 does?

74
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:25,802
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

75
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:27,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

76
00:06:27,102 --> 00:06:28,763
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 and 7, yeah.

77
00:06:31,185 --> 00:06:32,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'm wrong.

78
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 6 is the ward.

79
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:35,707
[SPEAKER_07]: You're right.

80
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:38,469
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that doesn't make sense.

81
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:42,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think it was 6.

82
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:43,712
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

83
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:47,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, no, it's seven.

84
00:06:47,934 --> 00:07:08,179
[SPEAKER_07]: See, because, so, and seven and one, combining seven with one, one is the other ward that has the most, the largest population of minority population next to ward seven.

85
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:13,060
[SPEAKER_07]: So by combining those, we keep, you know, we give that,

86
00:07:14,052 --> 00:07:15,652
[SPEAKER_07]: We dilute that power less.

87
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:17,433
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my thought anyway.

88
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:19,313
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Anthony.

89
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:27,755
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at the numbers for wards and districts, do we look at population?

90
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:30,736
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't look at voters, number of registered voters.

91
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:31,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?

92
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:33,377
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just general population?

93
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:37,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, because they use the census, so.

94
00:07:38,578 --> 00:07:43,619
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so how many voters doesn't really matter?

95
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:47,483
[SPEAKER_07]: not for drawing the wards, is my understanding.

96
00:07:47,503 --> 00:07:48,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

97
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:50,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Population.

98
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:51,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

99
00:07:51,986 --> 00:07:53,167
[SPEAKER_01]: At the state level as well.

100
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:55,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

101
00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:08,299
[SPEAKER_02]: And just when, you know, I understand, you know, the desire, and I have it as well, to have, you know, diversity and representation, but can we, like,

102
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:12,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we create a majority-minority district?

103
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,981
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that okay, legally?

104
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:20,886
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's what people want, but is that something that can be done or does it have to be more like a natural

105
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:51,138
[SPEAKER_02]: process or is that something that you know was caught you know usually caught mandated i just don't know enough about it um do you want me to answer that

106
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:52,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.

107
00:08:52,734 --> 00:08:55,255
[SPEAKER_07]: We have no authority to draw any wards.

108
00:08:55,695 --> 00:09:00,799
[SPEAKER_07]: That is done in conjunction with the state and the city council every 10 years.

109
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess they create districts, I'm saying.

110
00:09:07,503 --> 00:09:16,889
[SPEAKER_07]: But of the wards that they created in 2021, when we look at the demographics of those wards, we do have one majority-minority ward.

111
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:47,268
[SPEAKER_02]: that already exists um so that's that's all so what i'm saying is like i just want to say it's just like you know when we talk about you know majority minority like you know there could be you know different minority groups within that minority and uh we could you know we could be marginalizing one community and i think it's like

112
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:57,649
[SPEAKER_02]: To even take that into consideration is way beyond my bandwidth, because I don't know how to do it correctly, is what I'm saying.

113
00:09:58,049 --> 00:10:10,720
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see just picking numbers and say, I'm going to put these two together for geographic reasons, but to kind of say, we're creating a majority-minority ward,

114
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:20,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Minority and we kind of know disenfranchising a different minority, you know, you know what I'm saying?

115
00:10:20,693 --> 00:10:21,793
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very complicated.

116
00:10:21,813 --> 00:10:22,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

117
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:25,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I agree with you.

118
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,532
[SPEAKER_07]: The only reason I brought it up is because it has been a concern.

119
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:46,881
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that we have discussed as a whole committee and the subcommittee also talked about two communities, Lowell and Worcester, where lawsuits were brought against those cities for violations of the Voting Rights Act.

120
00:10:47,882 --> 00:10:54,186
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they then implemented ward representation because of that.

121
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:56,167
[SPEAKER_07]: We are not dealing with that right now.

122
00:10:57,038 --> 00:10:59,839
[SPEAKER_07]: But we did look at the demographics of each ward.

123
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,619
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have that information.

124
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,120
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's something that we can see.

125
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,681
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when we're combining wards, I feel that it's legitimate to consider it.

126
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:16,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I think it's legitimate to consider.

127
00:11:16,923 --> 00:11:25,685
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't know if we have the knowledge to do it correctly without kind of, you know,

128
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:27,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe yeah.

129
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:35,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

130
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:47,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, any other thoughts on these past these particular other thing I just wanted to say is, um, we can choose not to combine the wards and leave that up to the city council.

131
00:11:49,691 --> 00:11:52,133
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be the city council that would do it if we don't do it.

132
00:11:52,373 --> 00:11:52,533
[SPEAKER_07]: So

133
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:58,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we give them that option?

134
00:11:58,446 --> 00:12:05,433
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we give them like, this is plan one and plan two?

135
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:06,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Let Ron speak.

136
00:12:07,014 --> 00:12:07,795
[SPEAKER_07]: He's going crazy.

137
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:08,816
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Eunice, I'm sorry.

138
00:12:08,856 --> 00:12:09,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Your hand is up.

139
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:10,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

140
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:14,416
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess I'll just, you know, a few things.

141
00:12:14,436 --> 00:12:34,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I think regardless of how we end up here, the city is going to have to put out a pretty, you know, robust education campaign because this is like a complete wholesale change to how, you know, we've done business for the last nine million years.

142
00:12:35,007 --> 00:12:41,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, for people to realize now that their school committee is not at large,

143
00:12:42,565 --> 00:12:45,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, that that's that's a big deal.

144
00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:53,760
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, you know, that's going to require a good deal of education and, you know, might take a couple of election cycles for it to catch on.

145
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I don't really have a.

146
00:12:59,217 --> 00:13:12,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I don't have a preference yet, whether it's option one or option to, um, my observations, um, Option one, if you look at, you know, the map and you see.

147
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:15,784
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, like the.

148
00:13:16,565 --> 00:13:19,586
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, furthest away point of.

149
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:29,737
[SPEAKER_04]: is miles away from the most northern point of Ward 2.

150
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:44,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the furthest points on either end of each ward are, I mean, city's only so big, but it's pretty wide gap.

151
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:49,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Option 1, to me at least, seems like,

152
00:13:50,662 --> 00:13:53,483
[SPEAKER_04]: You get a little bit more diversity.

153
00:13:55,543 --> 00:14:00,884
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of racial and socioeconomic diversity.

154
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:06,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Option 2, as I think it was Milva brought up a little while ago.

155
00:14:08,346 --> 00:14:17,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty much gives us an elementary school in each district, or at least most and.

156
00:14:18,599 --> 00:14:24,262
[SPEAKER_04]: those wards, those districts are a little bit more socioeconomically similar.

157
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:45,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so, and then my third, my next point, my last point on this is if we went with option one, where it's sequential one, one with two, three with four, et cetera, et cetera, given my first point about this being a wholesale change for people, would it be,

158
00:14:47,662 --> 00:14:50,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and like I said, I'm not married to either option at the moment.

159
00:14:52,286 --> 00:15:00,733
[SPEAKER_04]: Would it be easier for the public out there to understand if we have the districts sequentially?

160
00:15:00,753 --> 00:15:02,694
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

161
00:15:02,894 --> 00:15:05,757
[SPEAKER_04]: All things worth discussing.

162
00:15:06,437 --> 00:15:06,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

163
00:15:07,318 --> 00:15:07,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

164
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey and Anthony, do you still have your hand up?

165
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:13,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

166
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:14,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Ron is in front of me.

167
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:15,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey and then Anthony.

168
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:17,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron, do you still have your?

169
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:19,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.

170
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:20,751
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

171
00:15:20,931 --> 00:15:21,291
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't.

172
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:23,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, OK.

173
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,274
[SPEAKER_07]: So who's next then?

174
00:15:25,814 --> 00:15:26,454
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead, Aubrey.

175
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:27,375
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to talk to it.

176
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:31,938
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I was going to throw a little.

177
00:15:32,058 --> 00:15:45,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I know this is last minute, but in the subcommittee, we were not, I was not fully, I was an out large voter and then changed my mind and see the merits of combined awards.

178
00:15:46,318 --> 00:15:53,185
[SPEAKER_09]: If it is difficult to propose combined warrants, I would not be sad to pull back to at-large voting.

179
00:15:55,207 --> 00:15:55,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

180
00:16:05,337 --> 00:16:05,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

181
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,362
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Ron was next.

182
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:12,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a couple of thoughts.

183
00:16:12,584 --> 00:16:16,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one is, the makeup of the awards are not changing at all.

184
00:16:17,429 --> 00:16:23,215
[SPEAKER_01]: Number two is, we don't have authority to do any kind of diversity balancing.

185
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:29,060
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not in our purview, so it's not something that is in front of this committee to discuss.

186
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:34,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Next is the point that you make about who can make the funds.

187
00:16:34,582 --> 00:16:37,963
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality is we recommend city council and the mayor.

188
00:16:38,944 --> 00:16:41,324
[SPEAKER_01]: They can change the wards anytime they want.

189
00:16:41,504 --> 00:16:43,785
[SPEAKER_01]: If they want to change the wards, that's their prerogative.

190
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,965
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the right to change anything we submit.

191
00:16:48,186 --> 00:16:54,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, you know, I think that what we need to do is put a selection of wards in there.

192
00:16:54,791 --> 00:17:00,796
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, if for some reason the city council doesn't like that, they have the prerogative to change it.

193
00:17:00,836 --> 00:17:02,977
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any recourse once they change something.

194
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:13,565
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is what we've already done in terms of ward representation is a huge change for the city in terms of bringing the vote back to the neighborhood.

195
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:14,946
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all should be proud of that.

196
00:17:16,587 --> 00:17:19,248
[SPEAKER_01]: To everybody else's point, I get it.

197
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:30,052
[SPEAKER_01]: The new election commissioner, I think Paula had a conversation with her, and it's as simple as creating ballots in each district.

198
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:31,753
[SPEAKER_01]: So it won't be confusing.

199
00:17:31,793 --> 00:17:35,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody will see only the candidates that are allowed to be seen in their district.

200
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:45,621
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, everything is a learning curve for sure, but, you know, the voters will need to educate themselves and the candidates will take that upon themselves to educate.

201
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:56,708
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that whether we go to option one or option two or something, you know, some other option is kind of a moot point.

202
00:17:56,768 --> 00:18:02,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can just, you know, I know we have a large agenda and I don't think this is as,

203
00:18:03,772 --> 00:18:06,053
[SPEAKER_01]: earth-shattering because it can always be changed.

204
00:18:06,093 --> 00:18:12,675
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to make the point too that the subcommittee believes that this is not our role to do, but obviously it is.

205
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:28,761
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also recommend that there should be established a review board that would consist something similar to the election commission that mandates by ordinance that a member of each of the major political parties are involved in that too because

206
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:35,903
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, when we start building new wards and new districts and new, you know, there's always a political reason for doing those things.

207
00:18:35,943 --> 00:18:40,304
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, that's, I just think a lot of this is out of our purview as for authority.

208
00:18:40,524 --> 00:18:55,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to see us just move it, move it along and say, yes, we're going with ward representation by district here, city council, we're going with ward representation, and then just pass it off because it's, you know, we could sit, we could spend two years trying to figure out the perfect,

209
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:58,830
[SPEAKER_01]: perfect choice and it would get changed.

210
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,251
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my opinion.

211
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:01,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

212
00:19:01,692 --> 00:19:02,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony and then Phyllis.

213
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:05,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have one quick question.

214
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:24,712
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of agree with what Ron just said, but just in the sense that when we're doing district for a school committee and ward for city councilor, do other cities do that or do they just have all

215
00:19:25,367 --> 00:19:27,228
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, all districts.

216
00:19:27,829 --> 00:19:30,751
[SPEAKER_07]: So combined wards are not common.

217
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:39,377
[SPEAKER_07]: But Lowell does have combined wards for school committee and just straight ward representation for city council.

218
00:19:39,938 --> 00:19:43,100
[SPEAKER_07]: So, so it is there is a precedent for it.

219
00:19:44,121 --> 00:19:46,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the new that's just happened.

220
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:46,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?

221
00:19:47,283 --> 00:19:48,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a year or two ago?

222
00:19:49,044 --> 00:19:49,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.

223
00:19:49,925 --> 00:19:53,307
[SPEAKER_07]: And Lowell, as we know, did that in response to the lawsuit.

224
00:19:53,327 --> 00:19:54,188
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

225
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:57,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, go ahead.

226
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:03,167
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I just, I kind of, like I said, I kind of agree with Ron to kind of move along.

227
00:20:03,187 --> 00:20:06,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we're going to get like a good, clear resolution on this.

228
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:14,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think maybe this is something we just pass along and tell the city council and the mayor, you know, this is what we recommend.

229
00:20:14,252 --> 00:20:16,173
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys figure it out because it's.

230
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:27,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is quite complicated, and there needs to be more kind of thought that goes into the creation of the district.

231
00:20:27,282 --> 00:20:40,733
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to make sure that we're not kind of doing it, you know, hurting any particular group, which I don't even know, you know, what group, you know, we don't even know.

232
00:20:40,753 --> 00:20:42,395
[SPEAKER_02]: We say majority, minority.

233
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:44,837
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even know what, you know,

234
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:47,723
[SPEAKER_02]: what that means, so that's it.

235
00:20:48,963 --> 00:20:50,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I have nothing else to add.

236
00:20:50,384 --> 00:20:52,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Phyllis.

237
00:20:52,106 --> 00:20:53,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I have three points.

238
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:57,249
[SPEAKER_08]: First, I'm going to reiterate what Ron has already said.

239
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:07,096
[SPEAKER_08]: We do not believe this is in our purview, but having been charged with this, the second point I want to make is I want to thank Ron and Paulette because they did a lot of work on this.

240
00:21:07,877 --> 00:21:13,281
[SPEAKER_08]: And third, I don't know that this is proper protocol, but I'm going to make a motion.

241
00:21:13,681 --> 00:21:14,822
[SPEAKER_08]: If we must do this,

242
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:25,215
[SPEAKER_08]: I make a motion to propose option two, because in option two, each of the combined districts would have a school in it.

243
00:21:25,315 --> 00:21:28,356
[SPEAKER_08]: So that my motion is to vote on option two.

244
00:21:30,237 --> 00:21:30,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

245
00:21:31,037 --> 00:21:31,898
[SPEAKER_08]: The combination.

246
00:21:34,098 --> 00:21:35,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we have a motion to

247
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:43,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one point, Melva, you have the verbiage that Phyllis wrote up for this motion.

248
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,942
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just a matter of changing the words and what she wrote.

249
00:21:47,002 --> 00:21:49,943
[SPEAKER_01]: But she wrote up what it should look like.

250
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:51,084
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you should have that.

251
00:21:52,464 --> 00:21:55,105
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean for the text?

252
00:21:55,446 --> 00:22:00,088
[SPEAKER_01]: The motion that we're about to vote on, she wrote the words for that.

253
00:22:00,868 --> 00:22:26,706
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah and okay so but right now we're just I'm just going to say a motion to accept option two which I just want to write down so that's boards one seven two three uh four five and six eight am I right about that yeah thank you um a motion to accept that uh uh for the uh as districts for um

254
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:30,572
[SPEAKER_07]: for the school committee.

255
00:22:30,592 --> 00:22:33,792
[SPEAKER_07]: I second the presentation.

256
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:34,173
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

257
00:22:34,193 --> 00:22:37,013
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, we're going to do roll call.

258
00:22:37,153 --> 00:22:37,553
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis?

259
00:22:38,454 --> 00:22:38,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

260
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:40,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice?

261
00:22:41,734 --> 00:22:41,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

262
00:22:43,555 --> 00:22:43,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron?

263
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:44,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

264
00:22:46,216 --> 00:22:46,596
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey?

265
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:50,917
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

266
00:22:51,077 --> 00:22:51,417
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony?

267
00:22:52,417 --> 00:22:52,697
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

268
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:54,858
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm also a yes.

269
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:55,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

270
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:56,731
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

271
00:22:57,111 --> 00:23:00,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations.

272
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:01,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I have one more thing to say.

273
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:07,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I've now almost four times lost my internet because it keeps saying weak connection.

274
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,000
[SPEAKER_08]: And I see that we have one more matter to vote on.

275
00:23:10,641 --> 00:23:14,384
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm hoping we can get to that vote because I think I must be here for the vote.

276
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:17,466
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing is, if I'm not here, we're okay.

277
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:21,373
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we may end up voting on some other article items later.

278
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:33,643
[SPEAKER_07]: But the other one that we have on the agenda is that we started talking about last meeting, the composition of the body for regular charter review.

279
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:45,253
[SPEAKER_07]: So we decided last time to recommend charter review every first five years from the time that the new charter is ratified, and then after that, every 10 years.

280
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:55,138
[SPEAKER_07]: So but what we didn't have a chance to thoroughly discuss or agree on is the composition of that body.

281
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,582
[SPEAKER_07]: So have people had a chance to think about it?

282
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't we talk about it a little bit?

283
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:19,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be a larger amount than sharing the responsibility of selection between the mayor, the city council, and the school committee kind of as evenly as possible?

284
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:31,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the example charter we looked at had it as nine, I believe, nine members.

285
00:24:32,353 --> 00:24:36,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Four appointed by the mayor, four by the city council, and one by the school committee chair.

286
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,559
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, four by the city council president.

287
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,882
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll just put that text up.

288
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:55,335
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was some discussion about how that's- I thought we had talked about bringing it into 11 and giving the school committee those other two, those other votes, those other selections.

289
00:24:56,086 --> 00:25:01,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we talked about some things, but we didn't come to any decisions and we were going to continue the discussion tonight.

290
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:04,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So Eunice and then Aubrey.

291
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thanks.

292
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:08,412
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a proposal here.

293
00:25:10,352 --> 00:25:19,937
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I'll say that I think all committee members should be voters in the city.

294
00:25:20,577 --> 00:25:23,378
[SPEAKER_04]: None should be politicians.

295
00:25:23,478 --> 00:25:24,479
[SPEAKER_04]: None should be electeds.

296
00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:30,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so that's off the top my suggestion is.

297
00:25:30,283 --> 00:25:42,994
[SPEAKER_04]: A committee of 12 and the reason I say that is because that's kind of what we've had all along and hopefully the next.

298
00:25:44,285 --> 00:25:53,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Group, you know, won't have as much work to do as we did starting a. You know, making a charter from scratch, but.

299
00:25:54,136 --> 00:26:02,966
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we were spread pretty thin sometimes, you know, we could have done more had we had more people in probably a lot of different respects.

300
00:26:04,047 --> 00:26:08,550
[SPEAKER_04]: And even tonight, just a little bit of a stretch to try and get a quorum.

301
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:21,938
[SPEAKER_04]: So my suggestion is, and actually, I think it's Framingham that had a committee of 12, nine appointees, nine voting appointees, and three non-voting alternates.

302
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:36,169
[SPEAKER_04]: and the alternates may participate in the discussion, do any research, participate every other way except for casting a vote unless one of the original nine drops off, resigns.

303
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:40,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just doesn't show up for one meeting, but completely resigns.

304
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:46,237
[SPEAKER_04]: All the appointees will be voters residing in Medford.

305
00:26:52,129 --> 00:27:07,336
[SPEAKER_04]: My way of kind of divvying them up would be four from the mayor, four from the city council president, and four from the school committee vice chair.

306
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:16,521
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I would like is, at minimum, each three of the

307
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:36,738
[SPEAKER_04]: For an example, and this would go for the three appointers, each appointer would appoint one Democrat, one Republican, and one unenrolled of the voting body.

308
00:27:37,879 --> 00:27:39,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, no, it would be each one of them

309
00:27:40,652 --> 00:27:49,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so that would give you nine, and then one of whichever for their alternate choice.

310
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:53,539
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be Democrat, Republican, or unenrolled.

311
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:59,262
[SPEAKER_04]: But at least you'd have one from each party, from each of the three appointers.

312
00:28:01,303 --> 00:28:05,725
[SPEAKER_04]: As I said, no member will be a current elected official or employee by the city.

313
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:09,968
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll reach those people in another fashion, just like we did this time.

314
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:23,006
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also strongly recommend the following, that committee members have a working knowledge of the current charter as it stands five years from now.

315
00:28:24,387 --> 00:28:38,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And some experience interacting with city government, either having watched an ample enough number of city council and school committee meetings,

316
00:28:40,632 --> 00:28:47,493
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my belief that we need to understand where we are and where we were to determine where we're going.

317
00:28:48,273 --> 00:28:59,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So to have experience interacting with our local government and watching meetings to understand what works and doesn't work, I think is really important.

318
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:09,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And to a lesser extent, it would be helpful if the committee members had some sort of familiarity as well with the multi-member bodies.

319
00:29:10,228 --> 00:29:14,011
[SPEAKER_04]: watching some meetings, attending some, interacting with them.

320
00:29:14,892 --> 00:29:16,373
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's my two cents.

321
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:18,434
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thanks.

322
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:25,100
[SPEAKER_07]: So hold that proposal, and I just want to let other people speak, and then we'll come back to it.

323
00:29:26,601 --> 00:29:26,961
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey.

324
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:32,926
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been going to propose.

325
00:29:33,006 --> 00:29:33,726
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I was muted.

326
00:29:34,627 --> 00:29:38,350
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to propose keep nine, three each.

327
00:29:41,105 --> 00:29:49,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't mind, Eunice's idea of alternates, but I don't want to include restrictions.

328
00:29:49,692 --> 00:29:52,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that can be part of the appointing body.

329
00:29:55,756 --> 00:29:56,116
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

330
00:29:57,998 --> 00:29:58,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

331
00:29:59,639 --> 00:30:00,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis and then Ron.

332
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:08,085
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know why we have to get into Democrat, Republican, Independent.

333
00:30:08,185 --> 00:30:10,107
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what anyone on this screen is.

334
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we might limit choices there.

335
00:30:14,492 --> 00:30:18,315
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know.

336
00:30:18,335 --> 00:30:25,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with Eunice on certain things that they should have a little familiarity with what's going on in the city.

337
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:36,767
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if we miss a good person, because I haven't had that, that they might bring something else with them to the point.

338
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:38,888
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree there should be a resident of the city.

339
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:45,301
[SPEAKER_08]: have some interest also in moving the city forward.

340
00:30:47,103 --> 00:30:52,130
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm not sure we need to have one Democrat, one Republican, one Independent.

341
00:30:54,293 --> 00:30:55,494
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a non-starter for me.

342
00:30:55,514 --> 00:30:58,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

343
00:30:58,658 --> 00:30:58,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron.

344
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree with what Phyllis said and what Eunice said.

345
00:31:03,664 --> 00:31:11,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that having substitutes or whatever the bench members doesn't make sense to me.

346
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:14,015
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to work on the committee, you should have a vote is my opinion.

347
00:31:14,696 --> 00:31:16,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondly, I think that

348
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:25,658
[SPEAKER_01]: giving, you know, if we're looking for who has to find the Republican, is it the mayor, the city council, the school committee?

349
00:31:25,678 --> 00:31:28,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd really be chasing and probably eliminating a lot of people.

350
00:31:29,141 --> 00:31:34,445
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm more in favor of just having Medford residents makes a lot of sense, of course.

351
00:31:35,045 --> 00:31:41,831
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of what your philosophies are, what your, honestly, to be what your base of knowledge is should be up to the,

352
00:31:43,752 --> 00:31:45,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Nominating board.

353
00:31:45,513 --> 00:32:06,449
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the people who pick the candidates will be responsible for those they pick and I don't know if we've ever uh, you know this kind of dictate qualities that we need is not necessarily you know, I would like them to have the freedom to to give it to who they think of the best people in there and who and and again again, we are under a

354
00:32:07,965 --> 00:32:14,786
[SPEAKER_01]: where this board, this review board only recommends to the people who are gonna make this decision.

355
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:22,528
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just, the more rules and qualifications we put on there, the less likely they are, in my opinion, to get in.

356
00:32:22,588 --> 00:32:25,928
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there should be method residents.

357
00:32:25,988 --> 00:32:31,689
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there should be anybody who's on the review board should have a vote, whatever that number is.

358
00:32:31,709 --> 00:32:34,470
[SPEAKER_01]: I think nine sounds good to me, but that's all.

359
00:32:35,934 --> 00:32:36,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

360
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:42,161
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a couple, we have a little bit of discussion and a couple of potential proposals.

361
00:32:42,962 --> 00:32:44,304
[SPEAKER_07]: I got my hand up again.

362
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:45,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Phyllis, go ahead.

363
00:32:46,967 --> 00:32:47,928
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to make a motion.

364
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:48,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

365
00:32:50,131 --> 00:32:55,738
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to make a motion that the committee consists of nine people.

366
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,302
[SPEAKER_08]: and that they be chosen for what they could bring to the table.

367
00:33:00,382 --> 00:33:06,005
[SPEAKER_08]: And by that, I mean, I think Eunice brings a good point that people, certain people should appoint them.

368
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:07,406
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's important.

369
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:15,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I think like we did this time, but I'm proposing that we have a nine member board, there'd be a nomination and an acceptance process.

370
00:33:16,652 --> 00:33:20,975
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's my proposal for the review committee going forward.

371
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:29,980
[SPEAKER_07]: So, okay, so the motion is that this body that we're talking about, the Charter Review Committee, be composed of nine people.

372
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you wanna be more specific about what you said with the nomination and a review process?

373
00:33:37,725 --> 00:33:41,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the only thing I said is they should be nominated and then accepted.

374
00:33:41,928 --> 00:33:44,330
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know who's gonna set the nomination process.

375
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the motion right now on the table is basically just addressing the number of people on the committee.

376
00:33:51,345 --> 00:33:52,566
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could start with that.

377
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:55,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean that makes sense to break these things down.

378
00:33:55,527 --> 00:34:01,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, but we don't have a second yet but we also have a couple of comments so Eunice and then Aubrey.

379
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, well I think as far as the number goes.

380
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:12,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine or 12, yeah, I'm kind of okay with either.

381
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:32,704
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, you know, I went with the 12 largely based on the fact of our experience here for the last almost two years, where, you know, like I said, you know, at the outset, there were times where we sure could have used a few more bodies.

382
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:39,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, if we had had a few more bodies, what else could we have done?

383
00:34:39,381 --> 00:34:58,505
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, now granted the next crop isn't going to be hopefully inventing an entirely new charter, but still to do some of the outreach and, um, you know, to the community, uh, interviews, surveys, events, et cetera, as well as, um,

384
00:35:01,012 --> 00:35:11,154
[SPEAKER_04]: just, you know, the amount of research and things that, you know, so many of us have done to be able to, you know, divvy that up.

385
00:35:12,334 --> 00:35:17,856
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Frances is, you know, you know, I was just, I went with either nine or 12 because that would give

386
00:35:23,977 --> 00:35:36,240
[SPEAKER_04]: the three appointers, you know, equal value, unless, you know, maybe we gave the mayor, you know, two more, because the mayor is as well the mayor.

387
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:47,262
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my biggest thing, you know, and it would be in this board and any other board or commission,

388
00:35:49,640 --> 00:36:08,893
[SPEAKER_04]: is how do you get a diversity of opinions, especially if one particular political group seems to be, you know, the dominant power in Medford, and they may appoint people that

389
00:36:10,615 --> 00:36:15,177
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, put forth, you know, their thought processes and their agendas.

390
00:36:16,558 --> 00:36:19,499
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we, how do we get differing voices?

391
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:32,485
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, you know, and whether it's the charter commission or the community garden or the zoning board or whatever, I think it's important to have a diversity of opinions.

392
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:36,207
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've got, you know, maybe the mayor, the president,

393
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:51,312
[SPEAKER_04]: the CC president and the school committee vice chair, all from one particular dominant political group, they're going to be looking for the people that align with them.

394
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:53,954
[SPEAKER_04]: You look confused, Phyllis.

395
00:36:57,597 --> 00:36:58,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis, you're muted.

396
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:00,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm trying to unmute myself.

397
00:37:00,989 --> 00:37:04,252
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm having a hard time hearing a lot, too.

398
00:37:05,032 --> 00:37:10,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm confused, Eunice, because I guess my point is that we don't know how the nomination process is going to go.

399
00:37:10,717 --> 00:37:19,263
[SPEAKER_08]: But if the mayor is going to appoint, like she appointed everyone, or he appointed everyone on this committee, I would say that we are a good diverse group.

400
00:37:21,085 --> 00:37:22,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I really think we are.

401
00:37:22,266 --> 00:37:27,930
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, several things have to go into, you know, like when I was asked to maybe consider joining this,

402
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:32,313
[SPEAKER_08]: I had to write why I wanted to do it, but I didn't have to put any political affiliation.

403
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:34,214
[SPEAKER_08]: I was asked, what could I bring?

404
00:37:34,275 --> 00:37:35,095
[SPEAKER_08]: What do I expect?

405
00:37:35,435 --> 00:37:36,216
[SPEAKER_08]: And all those things.

406
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:40,899
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why Milva said we should do it one piece at a time.

407
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,342
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe we should get to the number first and then the nomination process.

408
00:37:45,103 --> 00:37:53,309
[SPEAKER_08]: But I looked confused, Milva, because I was trying to recall how we were all appointed, which was by the mayor after our application.

409
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,644
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we apply, that's right.

410
00:37:58,185 --> 00:37:59,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the bunch that applied.

411
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:00,246
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

412
00:38:00,306 --> 00:38:03,668
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we're really well diverse group in lots of ways.

413
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:05,329
[SPEAKER_08]: We bring lots of different things with us.

414
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:07,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

415
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:12,613
[SPEAKER_07]: So before we look at the motion for a body of nine.

416
00:38:12,633 --> 00:38:15,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to say something.

417
00:38:15,475 --> 00:38:16,856
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go ahead, Anthony.

418
00:38:18,717 --> 00:38:23,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to say that, you know, something that was brought to our attention

419
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:36,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Early in the process is that where our committee has no diversity of of color, or, you know, we're all in, you know.

420
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,671
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't really represent.

421
00:38:40,495 --> 00:39:06,225
[SPEAKER_02]: uh the community and that that future charter commissions uh committees uh should have some kind of mechanism that you know we have more representation not of political uh views but of uh of people you know of age you know uh young old black white you know uh um you know uh non-english speakers i mean it

422
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:21,501
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're really going to be a diverse, welcoming community, we should really strive to be inclusive of other things than political party.

423
00:39:21,781 --> 00:39:25,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Our system in Medford is supposed to run as nonpartisan.

424
00:39:26,004 --> 00:39:27,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Our elections are nonpartisan.

425
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:34,470
[SPEAKER_02]: We elect people as individuals.

426
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:43,756
[SPEAKER_02]: There might be a slate in town and that might be dominating the political landscape now, but by the time this goes into effect, who knows?

427
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:48,399
[SPEAKER_02]: There could be other groups, there could be other people.

428
00:39:49,613 --> 00:39:51,634
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, politics shifts and changes.

429
00:39:52,314 --> 00:39:56,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that, you know, the charter commission should be based on that.

430
00:39:56,236 --> 00:40:02,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it should be based on kind of people, you know, get different people, uh, involved in government.

431
00:40:03,518 --> 00:40:05,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's my two cents.

432
00:40:05,759 --> 00:40:10,681
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how to do that other than to just kind of, uh, have some type of, uh,

433
00:40:11,338 --> 00:40:26,003
[SPEAKER_02]: statement that the mayor or city council should do what they can to select people from different communities so that we really get a true sense of what the people of Method want.

434
00:40:27,923 --> 00:40:28,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

435
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:29,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey.

436
00:40:33,205 --> 00:40:39,987
[SPEAKER_09]: Ten years from now, I don't know that we'll know what this is going to look like, and I am optimistic.

437
00:40:41,029 --> 00:40:45,792
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm trusting our voted bodies to be able to make those decisions.

438
00:40:46,672 --> 00:40:57,719
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I would like to propose that we have a nine-member special committee with three from the mayor, three from city council, and three from school committee.

439
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

440
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,242
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is basically adding on to Phyllis's motion.

441
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we go ahead with that, Veron, did you have one more thing to say?

442
00:41:09,629 --> 00:41:12,914
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I agree 100% with what Aubrey just said.

443
00:41:13,675 --> 00:41:18,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I think our theme has been recently, we're not legislating how this process gets done.

444
00:41:18,441 --> 00:41:23,027
[SPEAKER_01]: We're establishing a process and trusting that the leaders will do what they need to do.

445
00:41:24,412 --> 00:41:27,973
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the voters to remember that they are the ones who have the ultimate power.

446
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:37,595
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the next round of review is going to be a lot easier, a lot less discovery needs to be done, and hopefully it becomes a patent that everybody follows.

447
00:41:37,635 --> 00:41:42,756
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I think we always forget that the voter is the final power in this play.

448
00:41:42,836 --> 00:41:48,897
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree with Aubrey's, and yeah, I just want to make sure that the Medford residence is the requirement.

449
00:41:49,097 --> 00:41:49,337
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

450
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:49,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

451
00:41:50,137 --> 00:41:52,718
[SPEAKER_07]: So before we go ahead with that, Anthony, did you have one more comment?

452
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,640
[SPEAKER_07]: He just didn't put his hand down.

453
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:55,281
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

454
00:41:55,801 --> 00:41:56,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, I'm sorry.

455
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:57,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't put my hand down.

456
00:41:57,801 --> 00:41:58,322
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

457
00:41:58,562 --> 00:42:05,904
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would like, I would like to amend and see if anybody's willing to let me amend that to make it 11, 11 members.

458
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:17,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we can, you know, have, you know, extra people in case the committee, uh, can't, uh, can't keep, you know, the nine members.

459
00:42:17,808 --> 00:42:22,229
[SPEAKER_02]: If nine members turn into six or five, uh, you know, with, uh,

460
00:42:23,106 --> 00:42:29,692
[SPEAKER_02]: where people dropping off, I think the process, I don't wanna shortchange the process.

461
00:42:30,152 --> 00:42:34,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we need more people involved and I think 11 work better than nine.

462
00:42:35,717 --> 00:42:43,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so we have, so if we just start with the number, we have one proposal on the table for nine and one for 11.

463
00:42:43,984 --> 00:42:46,886
[SPEAKER_09]: May I ask a question?

464
00:42:47,386 --> 00:42:47,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

465
00:42:48,487 --> 00:42:51,370
[SPEAKER_09]: If we say nine and then there aren't nine,

466
00:42:52,553 --> 00:42:55,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that mean that they have to then replace it to get to nine?

467
00:42:55,956 --> 00:42:58,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, I'm wondering if we have 11 and dropped, then we have to keep 11.

468
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:01,380
[SPEAKER_09]: If we have nine, then we have to keep nine.

469
00:43:02,821 --> 00:43:03,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that how that works?

470
00:43:04,162 --> 00:43:08,386
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's in the charter, it's going to be that way unless it gets changed.

471
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:12,929
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's pretty set in stone, I think.

472
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:17,553
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we should wait.

473
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:26,173
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know what the best way to go about this is, because we have nine or 11.

474
00:43:26,334 --> 00:43:30,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's have a quick vote on nine.

475
00:43:30,715 --> 00:43:31,256
[SPEAKER_07]: On the nine?

476
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:32,436
[SPEAKER_01]: The motion that we do nine members.

477
00:43:34,337 --> 00:43:34,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Second?

478
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:36,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

479
00:43:36,758 --> 00:43:38,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

480
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:39,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey?

481
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

482
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:44,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis?

483
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:45,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

484
00:43:45,562 --> 00:43:45,842
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice?

485
00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:51,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Go back to me.

486
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,010
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony.

487
00:43:53,951 --> 00:43:54,211
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

488
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:57,453
[SPEAKER_07]: I already got you Ron, right?

489
00:43:57,473 --> 00:43:57,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I get you?

490
00:43:58,414 --> 00:43:58,754
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

491
00:43:59,375 --> 00:43:59,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

492
00:43:59,955 --> 00:44:00,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron is a yes?

493
00:44:00,796 --> 00:44:01,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

494
00:44:02,997 --> 00:44:03,637
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a yes.

495
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:04,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Phil, Eunice?

496
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:06,419
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

497
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:07,900
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

498
00:44:08,301 --> 00:44:10,182
[SPEAKER_07]: So we landed at nine.

499
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:16,966
[SPEAKER_07]: So now the next question is the composition of that or the,

500
00:44:18,727 --> 00:44:19,689
[SPEAKER_07]: the appointments.

501
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:27,702
[SPEAKER_07]: So Aubrey had proposed three, three, three, three from the mayor, three from the city council president and three from the school committee vice chair.

502
00:44:28,628 --> 00:44:36,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, can I just amend that so we just call it city council and school committee and let them determine how they pick?

503
00:44:36,852 --> 00:44:44,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the mayor is the chair of the school committee, so she would be able to pick six technically with that rule.

504
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:49,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to see the city council and the school committee develop their own plan on how they're going to pick it.

505
00:44:53,203 --> 00:44:55,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's why we said vice chair, right?

506
00:44:55,384 --> 00:45:01,648
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we do it that way, we could, but then those bodies would have to spend time figuring that out.

507
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:08,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas, you know, it's a quicker appointment process if it's one person, that's all.

508
00:45:10,054 --> 00:45:10,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony.

509
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,197
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I can't get my hands out.

510
00:45:15,578 --> 00:45:18,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to say, I understand the,

511
00:45:19,895 --> 00:45:23,178
[SPEAKER_07]: inclination to make it even between the three bodies of government.

512
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:39,014
[SPEAKER_07]: But the school committee is so specialized and the school committee, in terms of what's in the charter on the school committee, it's pretty narrow because the school committee is really governed by state law, pretty much the composition of the school committee.

513
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:47,615
[SPEAKER_07]: is in the charter, and maybe some very general timelines about budget.

514
00:45:47,735 --> 00:45:50,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing really even that specific about budget.

515
00:45:50,737 --> 00:45:53,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know.

516
00:45:53,479 --> 00:45:57,181
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just, I wonder if we should make it equal due to that.

517
00:45:57,781 --> 00:45:58,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Just throwing that out there.

518
00:46:00,963 --> 00:46:01,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we lost Phyllis.

519
00:46:02,204 --> 00:46:02,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, no, we didn't.

520
00:46:02,804 --> 00:46:03,164
[SPEAKER_04]: She's there.

521
00:46:03,364 --> 00:46:04,825
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great point, Belva.

522
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:06,266
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a great point.

523
00:46:06,446 --> 00:46:07,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be more like 432.

524
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:12,503
[SPEAKER_06]: The example charter we looked at had 4-4-1.

525
00:46:12,523 --> 00:46:20,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So 4-3-2 is, I mean, 4-4-1 gives the mayor and the city council equal number of appointments and says to the school committee, we want you to have a representative basically.

526
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:41,203
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, 432 says, well, the mayor gets more, I don't know.

527
00:46:41,443 --> 00:46:42,124
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, yeah.

528
00:46:45,084 --> 00:46:45,544
[SPEAKER_08]: What do we think?

529
00:46:45,564 --> 00:46:47,886
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate to keep saying this, but I'm going to lose.

530
00:46:48,146 --> 00:46:49,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to lose you soon.

531
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:50,247
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

532
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:51,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

533
00:46:51,748 --> 00:46:52,909
[SPEAKER_08]: We're down to nine.

534
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:55,071
[SPEAKER_07]: We got we got.

535
00:46:55,471 --> 00:46:58,393
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not stressful.

536
00:46:58,953 --> 00:46:59,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Danielle.

537
00:46:59,994 --> 00:47:05,718
[SPEAKER_07]: We're discussing the composition of the Charter Review Committee, which is going to be nine people.

538
00:47:05,738 --> 00:47:07,619
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're discussing how they are appointed.

539
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:17,424
[SPEAKER_07]: And three from the mayor, three from the city council president, three from the school committee vice chair was proposed.

540
00:47:17,464 --> 00:47:24,211
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I pointed out that the school committee's role, you know, the school committee is governed by state law.

541
00:47:24,351 --> 00:47:27,575
[SPEAKER_07]: So the charter really only addresses the school committee composition.

542
00:47:28,856 --> 00:47:33,321
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question is, should they have as much input in the pits?

543
00:47:34,341 --> 00:47:44,587
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to make a motion that we establish a review board of nine members, four appointed by the mayor, four appointed by the city council, and one appointed by the school committee.

544
00:47:46,288 --> 00:47:47,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I second that motion.

545
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:48,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

546
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:49,990
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

547
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:50,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's vote then.

548
00:47:51,991 --> 00:47:52,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron.

549
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:55,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron says yes.

550
00:47:56,614 --> 00:47:56,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey.

551
00:47:59,516 --> 00:48:00,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Aubrey says yes.

552
00:48:01,357 --> 00:48:01,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis.

553
00:48:03,525 --> 00:48:04,265
[SPEAKER_07]: Ellis says yes.

554
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:05,466
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

555
00:48:05,806 --> 00:48:06,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Eunice.

556
00:48:06,946 --> 00:48:09,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Eunice says yes, since we're all talking in the third person.

557
00:48:09,627 --> 00:48:12,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Try getting on your phone.

558
00:48:12,908 --> 00:48:13,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

559
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:15,449
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony.

560
00:48:15,469 --> 00:48:18,530
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to abstain.

561
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:20,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

562
00:48:21,171 --> 00:48:22,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm voting yes.

563
00:48:23,011 --> 00:48:23,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Did I miss anybody?

564
00:48:23,951 --> 00:48:25,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think I did.

565
00:48:26,466 --> 00:48:41,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so the only thing that we didn't talk about was, I mean, we touched on some of the issues that Eunice brought up in terms of, you know, requiring that they all be residents, requiring, you know,

566
00:48:45,125 --> 00:48:45,605
[SPEAKER_07]: other things.

567
00:48:45,685 --> 00:48:47,166
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was some discussion of that.

568
00:48:47,306 --> 00:48:48,306
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice, do you want to?

569
00:48:50,706 --> 00:49:05,030
[SPEAKER_04]: My first question is, and maybe this goes back to, circles back to whatever we said about multi-member boards a long time ago, is it residents or is it voters?

570
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,481
[SPEAKER_04]: two different things.

571
00:49:08,202 --> 00:49:14,007
[SPEAKER_04]: So what did we say about multi-member boards or did we?

572
00:49:14,147 --> 00:49:19,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we didn't, but it should be consistent across the board.

573
00:49:21,514 --> 00:49:26,979
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it could, yeah, it could be consistent or we could decide to make it different.

574
00:49:26,999 --> 00:49:30,983
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, but I'd have to look back at what we said about multi-member boards.

575
00:49:31,023 --> 00:49:31,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody remember?

576
00:49:35,602 --> 00:49:38,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there an age requirement to be on a board or commission?

577
00:49:39,623 --> 00:49:40,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I know of.

578
00:49:41,084 --> 00:49:46,345
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could be not eligible to vote, but you could be on?

579
00:49:47,106 --> 00:49:48,746
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends on whether we say voters.

580
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,667
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to pull up the example text that we looked at says voters.

581
00:49:52,947 --> 00:49:58,689
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we said voters, that would put an age requirement on it.

582
00:50:05,886 --> 00:50:28,024
[SPEAKER_02]: or we could say residents or, I mean, Anthony, I'm sorry to keep asking you, but you're... Well, since my hand was already up by accident, I kind of have the same questions Danielle is bringing up is that, you know, age, residents, you know,

583
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:43,656
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, just because you don't vote doesn't mean you're not a resident and you're not a taxpayer and that the government doesn't affect your life and that you shouldn't have a say in what happens in a community.

584
00:50:44,157 --> 00:50:58,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have people here that live here in Medford who can't, say, vote for the mayor or the school committee, but, you know, should be able to participate in the government because, you know, they live here.

585
00:50:59,025 --> 00:51:01,206
[SPEAKER_02]: pay taxes, and they're part of our community.

586
00:51:01,286 --> 00:51:24,971
[SPEAKER_02]: So any way we could include them, you know, even though they may not be able to vote, you know, I think we should, you know, Medford should, you know, strive to be an inclusive place where, you know, you know, the new members of the community actually have some kind of voice in City Hall.

587
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:33,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so that would be an argument for saying residents instead of voters.

588
00:51:34,661 --> 00:51:36,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I agree with that.

589
00:51:37,622 --> 00:51:39,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it should be consistent.

590
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:44,224
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I mean, this is this is a multi member board too.

591
00:51:44,745 --> 00:51:46,005
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's true.

592
00:51:46,025 --> 00:51:46,325
[SPEAKER_04]: You know.

593
00:51:49,617 --> 00:51:51,979
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either 1 way or the other for everything.

594
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:54,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I think unless there's some specific reason.

595
00:51:55,541 --> 00:52:00,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe well, no, we don't have the elections commission wouldn't come under this.

596
00:52:00,904 --> 00:52:01,725
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be different.

597
00:52:02,245 --> 00:52:04,627
[SPEAKER_04]: You might have to actually be a voter, but.

598
00:52:05,927 --> 00:52:10,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for anything else, it's either 1 way or the other.

599
00:52:12,131 --> 00:52:17,215
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I guess the election commission does require you to be a member of a political party.

600
00:52:17,255 --> 00:52:17,555
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe.

601
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:26,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, they have, I think, two of each, two Democrats, two Republicans.

602
00:52:26,234 --> 00:52:31,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody remember what the language of multi-member boards?

603
00:52:31,979 --> 00:52:33,961
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking it up here.

604
00:52:36,303 --> 00:52:43,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember we, well, we did have a discussion about using that language of voters, but that might've been for running for office.

605
00:52:45,598 --> 00:52:50,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think running for office, I mean, that's not a local decision, I think.

606
00:52:50,839 --> 00:52:51,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

607
00:52:51,879 --> 00:52:54,980
[SPEAKER_04]: From the Secretary of State, you have to be a voter, so.

608
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:00,582
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

609
00:53:02,562 --> 00:53:07,483
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't say anything about it in the current language we have.

610
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:14,485
[SPEAKER_07]: We just say that the mayor refers the names to the city council,

611
00:53:16,018 --> 00:53:17,956
[SPEAKER_07]: and then the city council can confirm.

612
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:24,964
[SPEAKER_07]: or that they go in unless the city council rejects them.

613
00:53:25,324 --> 00:53:33,429
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a whole section in section nine that we'll get to eventually that I think talks about multi-member bodies.

614
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:35,430
[SPEAKER_04]: That might be where- Yeah.

615
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:36,531
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't discussed it yet.

616
00:53:36,991 --> 00:53:37,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.

617
00:53:37,871 --> 00:53:42,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I just couldn't remember if we touched on it when we did other stuff about the bodies.

618
00:53:43,235 --> 00:53:43,475
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

619
00:53:43,555 --> 00:53:44,075
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

620
00:53:44,235 --> 00:53:46,677
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the answer is we haven't discussed it yet.

621
00:53:47,377 --> 00:53:51,719
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are discussing it now in relation to the charter review body.

622
00:53:51,739 --> 00:54:04,924
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I mean, I guess we could just combine them and say we're going to decide whether we want it to be residents or voters for any multi-member body, which includes this body.

623
00:54:04,944 --> 00:54:06,385
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?

624
00:54:08,736 --> 00:54:16,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it's unless it's required by state law, like the election commission, you know, something that's something that you need to be a voter for.

625
00:54:16,902 --> 00:54:22,727
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you need to be a voter, but to be on the, you know, the bicycle commission, if you're.

626
00:54:23,466 --> 00:54:34,212
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, unable, you know, you're a resident alien and you're a bicycle rider, you should be, you know, have, you know, say on the bicycle commission, you know.

627
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:34,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

628
00:54:34,892 --> 00:54:42,056
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, anything in the charter regarding, you know, if there are certain bodies that are governed by state law that would apply.

629
00:54:42,496 --> 00:54:47,239
[SPEAKER_07]: So the charter is really only talking about the bodies that aren't governed by law.

630
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:56,566
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do we do we think that's a good approach to make this decision for all multi member bodies?

631
00:54:59,432 --> 00:55:00,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Voter or resident?

632
00:55:02,478 --> 00:55:02,819
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

633
00:55:04,362 --> 00:55:06,502
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever I think we decide on has to be consistent.

634
00:55:07,023 --> 00:55:13,624
[SPEAKER_01]: It just also has to say we're allowed by state law, because there are some commissions that have to have some kind of balance.

635
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:19,965
[SPEAKER_01]: So this verbiage should say something about within general laws of the state of Massachusetts.

636
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:25,286
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Collin Center will like, you know, catch that stuff for us.

637
00:55:25,626 --> 00:55:29,727
[SPEAKER_01]: So are we amending this?

638
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:32,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to Article 9 and doing that now?

639
00:55:33,817 --> 00:55:50,586
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we have the charter, we have the charter body, the charter review body, but I guess we're kind of morphing, moving into the overall Articles 5 and 9 issues that people might have questions about.

640
00:55:51,266 --> 00:55:59,150
[SPEAKER_07]: So, which units, you said there's a section in there for... I think there

641
00:56:00,063 --> 00:56:01,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Is or if not, I put it there.

642
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:10,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember because I was doing a whole lot of research on Article 9 over the last day or so.

643
00:56:12,768 --> 00:56:26,854
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if we decide we want the charter to say, you know, something about eligibility for serving on these bodies, we can just tell that to the Collins Center and they'll put it in the appropriate spot.

644
00:56:27,214 --> 00:56:28,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony, do you have your hand up?

645
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,421
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I keep asking you.

646
00:56:34,462 --> 00:56:36,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so.

647
00:56:36,324 --> 00:56:41,409
[SPEAKER_07]: Do does somebody want to make a motion on this or.

648
00:56:42,951 --> 00:56:45,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, as it is right now, if we say nothing about it.

649
00:56:48,176 --> 00:56:52,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I would imagine it's up to the appointing authority, you know, the appointing body.

650
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I think what about.

651
00:56:54,704 --> 00:57:06,972
[SPEAKER_04]: putting something in like we've done in some other places before where, you know, this body is, what's the word I want?

652
00:57:06,992 --> 00:57:10,754
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and refer them over to section nine.

653
00:57:10,774 --> 00:57:15,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Any rules regarding this,

654
00:57:16,713 --> 00:57:29,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless spelled out here, any rules regarding the Charter Commission are the same rules as governed by multi-member bodies in Article 9-4 or whatever.

655
00:57:32,492 --> 00:57:37,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just moved to make a decision whether we want residents or voters to be the qualifier.

656
00:57:37,695 --> 00:57:42,298
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, as you said, no, the call and send is going to catch it when it comes up again.

657
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:48,241
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all going to have to vote on it again when we talk about the general commissions and boards.

658
00:57:48,301 --> 00:57:58,807
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we could get this, you know, an idea of are we for residents or for voters, registered voters, at least that gets us beyond this because it's going to come up again.

659
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,641
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that sounds good.

660
00:58:00,941 --> 00:58:09,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to make one point, which is that I don't think that we are required to put anything about eligibility for these in the charter.

661
00:58:09,906 --> 00:58:22,573
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the appointing authority for multi-member bodies, and if nothing is said, then the appointing authority makes a decision about who to appoint and doesn't have an eligibility requirement to deal with.

662
00:58:24,855 --> 00:58:35,384
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think maybe in the example charter we looked at for the Charter Commission one, they've decided that they wanted that body to be voters, so they put that in that particular section.

663
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:43,372
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just throwing it out there that we can choose not to include it and leave it at the discretion of the appointing authority.

664
00:58:44,283 --> 00:58:45,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I ask a question?

665
00:58:45,805 --> 00:58:53,573
[SPEAKER_01]: When the building committee meets and the building commissioner is on that committee, is he a non-voting member?

666
00:58:55,355 --> 00:58:56,336
[SPEAKER_07]: That I don't know.

667
00:58:56,496 --> 00:58:58,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he wouldn't have to be a Medford resident to be on that.

668
00:58:58,858 --> 00:59:00,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, exactly.

669
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,763
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of scenarios that we're not...

670
00:59:04,644 --> 00:59:15,536
[SPEAKER_01]: To paint this all in one scenario is not easy because there are a lot of folks who work with these departments and commissions that are not residents because their expertise is not in the city.

671
00:59:17,939 --> 00:59:20,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Is Frances still with us?

672
00:59:21,062 --> 00:59:22,804
[SPEAKER_07]: Frances, I think, is on her phone.

673
00:59:24,021 --> 00:59:29,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I know she oversees a bunch of boards, including, I think, the human rights commission.

674
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:33,647
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think chief Buckley has voting rights.

675
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:39,110
[SPEAKER_04]: On that commission, and I don't believe he's a Medford resident.

676
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:44,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so to Ron's point, I think, you know, maybe it does differ with.

677
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:53,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I move that we vote that the members of the Charter Review Commission must be residents of the city of Manfred.

678
00:59:54,198 --> 00:59:55,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Must be residents, not voters?

679
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,781
[SPEAKER_01]: I second that motion.

680
00:59:58,821 --> 01:00:05,046
[SPEAKER_01]: We can yay or nay that one, and then that would leave us with the other, which is just to be voters, so just to be.

681
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:10,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so Aubrey, were you going to say something?

682
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:15,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Or the third option, which was Milva's suggestion, which is to not have any

683
01:00:16,623 --> 01:00:18,323
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a 9, 4, 4, 1.

684
01:00:19,264 --> 01:00:19,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

685
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:26,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Would somebody be able to make up like, when they go to choose the commission, would they be able to make it more narrow eligibility requirement?

686
01:00:26,925 --> 01:00:29,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Or like, is it better that we define it more broadly here?

687
01:00:29,466 --> 01:00:36,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Medford requirement is extremely important and I would like to see it on the charter.

688
01:00:36,388 --> 01:00:38,048
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than that, no.

689
01:00:38,748 --> 01:00:38,928
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

690
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think being a resident is just a no brainer.

691
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:42,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

692
01:00:43,569 --> 01:00:44,850
[SPEAKER_09]: They can make it more narrow.

693
01:00:45,470 --> 01:00:46,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Medford.

694
01:00:48,096 --> 01:00:49,837
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you made that as a motion, Ron?

695
01:00:49,857 --> 01:00:52,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'd second it if you had.

696
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:58,743
[SPEAKER_01]: The motion is that all charter review members must be residents of the City of Medford.

697
01:00:59,944 --> 01:01:00,684
[SPEAKER_02]: I second that.

698
01:01:01,465 --> 01:01:01,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

699
01:01:02,445 --> 01:01:04,347
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Ron?

700
01:01:05,187 --> 01:01:05,507
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

701
01:01:06,728 --> 01:01:07,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony?

702
01:01:07,829 --> 01:01:08,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

703
01:01:08,629 --> 01:01:08,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice?

704
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:09,790
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

705
01:01:11,211 --> 01:01:11,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey?

706
01:01:13,573 --> 01:01:13,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

707
01:01:15,234 --> 01:01:15,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle?

708
01:01:16,698 --> 01:01:16,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

709
01:01:17,498 --> 01:01:18,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Did we lose Phyllis?

710
01:01:21,339 --> 01:01:21,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, maybe.

711
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

712
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:30,182
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm actually going to vote no, because I actually think for this particular thing, they should be voters.

713
01:01:30,242 --> 01:01:30,842
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's OK.

714
01:01:31,182 --> 01:01:33,482
[SPEAKER_07]: So we'll save residents for this.

715
01:01:34,723 --> 01:01:39,144
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I move reconsideration and vote no as well, along with you?

716
01:01:39,804 --> 01:01:40,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

717
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:43,485
[SPEAKER_07]: And that still passes.

718
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:49,183
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

719
01:01:49,663 --> 01:01:49,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

720
01:01:50,584 --> 01:01:52,566
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we're done with the unit.

721
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:55,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, Aubrey, did you want to say something?

722
01:01:55,128 --> 01:02:05,117
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a section in 9.4 that says all members of the committee shall be voters, but this is for the review of ordinances in the city.

723
01:02:05,518 --> 01:02:07,620
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we just be consistent.

724
01:02:09,143 --> 01:02:17,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, actually, with the consistency issue, because we're saying that there are like already boards and commissions that have their own criteria.

725
01:02:17,876 --> 01:02:23,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't, I feel like it's okay to have different opinions for different boards and commissions.

726
01:02:23,982 --> 01:02:25,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree with that too.

727
01:02:25,823 --> 01:02:31,586
[SPEAKER_07]: But this particular, just to be clear, what we're looking at is just an example text.

728
01:02:31,686 --> 01:02:34,288
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't our draft necessarily.

729
01:02:35,068 --> 01:02:43,613
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I wanted to do with this, because we didn't have subcommittees that were actually drafting these sections,

730
01:02:44,453 --> 01:02:48,855
[SPEAKER_07]: is make pertinent decisions and then the Collins Center will draft it for us.

731
01:02:49,095 --> 01:02:53,777
[SPEAKER_07]: And actually, I think that periodic review of ordinances was one that I wanted to look at.

732
01:02:53,857 --> 01:02:57,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Because a lot of it is standard language, but this one we probably should decide about.

733
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,641
[SPEAKER_07]: So first of all, are we done with periodic review of charter?

734
01:03:03,921 --> 01:03:04,601
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we are.

735
01:03:06,162 --> 01:03:12,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there is a timeline here in this particular, I believe this is Melrose's.

736
01:03:16,724 --> 01:03:19,785
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's probably standard language.

737
01:03:19,805 --> 01:03:27,248
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be good to keep the timeline in there, but we can let the call-in center put that in for us.

738
01:03:27,288 --> 01:03:28,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Are people okay with that?

739
01:03:29,229 --> 01:03:33,931
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it seems pretty reasonable.

740
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:36,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, now what about periodic review of ordinances?

741
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:42,135
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we think every five years is good for that, or is that too often?

742
01:03:46,491 --> 01:03:49,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we know what is the protocol now?

743
01:03:49,898 --> 01:03:50,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there an ordinance now?

744
01:03:52,023 --> 01:03:52,905
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe there are.

745
01:03:53,706 --> 01:03:55,791
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not in the charter, I don't think, but does somebody know?

746
01:03:56,967 --> 01:03:58,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's in the charter.

747
01:03:58,348 --> 01:04:14,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I think actually, as when the city council this year put out their governing agenda back in January and divided themselves up into about seven or eight standing committees.

748
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:21,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I think each standing committee has purview over certain

749
01:04:23,297 --> 01:04:24,357
[SPEAKER_04]: areas and topics.

750
01:04:25,117 --> 01:04:49,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think one of the things that each of the standing committees has vowed to do over the course of their two year term is take whatever sub areas that they're responsible for and go through ordinances in that, you know, in that, in their purview and, um, you know,

751
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:57,805
[SPEAKER_04]: update them, sunset them if need be, or basically give them an overhaul.

752
01:04:59,946 --> 01:05:01,968
[SPEAKER_04]: We've added ordinances over the years.

753
01:05:02,588 --> 01:05:13,955
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's been any actual real good effort at overhauling the ordinances in heaven knows how long.

754
01:05:15,616 --> 01:05:17,297
[SPEAKER_04]: I think having this in there,

755
01:05:18,454 --> 01:05:22,056
[SPEAKER_04]: at intervals.

756
01:05:22,076 --> 01:05:35,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I think whatever they're doing now, like what we've done with the charter, five years from now and 15 years from now, whoever is doing it isn't going to be doing what we did.

757
01:05:35,624 --> 01:05:45,229
[SPEAKER_04]: When the council does their ordinances over this two-year term, then five years later, they should only be making tweaks and not reinventing it.

758
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:46,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

759
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:52,764
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever the first review of ordinances, if this gets into the charter, will be probably more extensive then.

760
01:05:52,784 --> 01:06:01,326
[SPEAKER_07]: I do notice that the language of this one says some or all of the ordinances of the city, which is interesting.

761
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:07,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And maybe that makes sense because I don't know, what do people think?

762
01:06:08,407 --> 01:06:10,448
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we even know how many ordinances are in?

763
01:06:10,568 --> 01:06:15,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have like, is it a little ordinance book or is it like, you know, a filing cabinet?

764
01:06:16,555 --> 01:06:19,256
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on its code on the city website.

765
01:06:19,916 --> 01:06:21,277
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's pretty extensive.

766
01:06:22,697 --> 01:06:24,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why it says some.

767
01:06:25,458 --> 01:06:26,579
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that makes sense.

768
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:33,981
[SPEAKER_04]: An ordinance that was created a year ago isn't going to need to be revamped in all likelihood, but an ordinance.

769
01:06:34,421 --> 01:06:39,423
[SPEAKER_01]: And a new ordinance can be, I mean, they can change, the city council can change it without this review board.

770
01:06:39,523 --> 01:06:41,364
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, ordinances can be changed.

771
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:42,252
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course.

772
01:06:42,272 --> 01:06:45,013
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not nobody has to wait.

773
01:06:45,193 --> 01:06:50,274
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, that's why I think it's some because there's always it's a it's an ongoing process.

774
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:56,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, OK, so do people think that it's a given what Ron just pointed out?

775
01:06:56,875 --> 01:07:00,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it necessary to have a periodic review of ordinances in the charter?

776
01:07:01,536 --> 01:07:02,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah, well.

777
01:07:03,036 --> 01:07:09,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing is, like the city council, you know, that's what they were elected to do was to, you know, did a legislature they

778
01:07:11,969 --> 01:07:28,907
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't it up to the elected city council to kind of decide whether they're going to go through ordinances or they have other things to do or you know do we have to kind of put a you know a sword over their head you know is it you know that they have to do it because it's in the charter

779
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:34,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just wondering why Melrose has that in their charter.

780
01:07:35,053 --> 01:07:45,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's not unusual for it to be in the charter and this wouldn't necessarily be, this is not the city council that's reviewing the ordinances, it's a special committee.

781
01:07:46,179 --> 01:07:55,589
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think a part of this process is making sure the legality of the ordinance is still in effect because it also says we need, it's under the supervision of the city solicitor.

782
01:07:55,629 --> 01:08:00,875
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's a validation that, you know, is this legal?

783
01:08:01,596 --> 01:08:06,361
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, continuing to check up to, you know, if the state changes the law, are we up to date on it?

784
01:08:06,421 --> 01:08:07,963
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that's really what it's about.

785
01:08:11,026 --> 01:08:13,028
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Eunice, do you have something you want to say?

786
01:08:13,128 --> 01:08:19,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I think we probably have some, you know, some things in there that are pretty well outdated, too.

787
01:08:19,735 --> 01:08:26,463
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, the city council's job is zoning, passing the budget, and creating ordinances.

788
01:08:26,783 --> 01:08:28,726
[SPEAKER_04]: That's their three main jobs.

789
01:08:32,664 --> 01:08:45,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I think to have a committee that is going to look at our ordinances at some specific interval, I think is a good thing.

790
01:08:45,797 --> 01:08:55,427
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it ensures that we're, like Ron says, things remain legal, things remain contemporary.

791
01:08:56,539 --> 01:09:07,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, I mean, you don't want to be looking at an ordinance that says, you know, you can't park your horse and carriage on 4th street in front of the post office, you know, or something like that.

792
01:09:07,345 --> 01:09:10,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, but I think we have some pretty outdated stuff in there.

793
01:09:10,747 --> 01:09:16,591
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, uh, I, I, I would, I'm a proponent of keeping this there.

794
01:09:17,291 --> 01:09:17,631
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

795
01:09:18,152 --> 01:09:18,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Aubrey.

796
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I was going to say something similar.

797
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:28,762
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the idea of keeping the option and it can be as big or as little review as happens to be needed.

798
01:09:30,682 --> 01:09:37,483
[SPEAKER_07]: So do we like, I mean, does somebody want to propose, do we like five-year intervals?

799
01:09:38,423 --> 01:09:40,744
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty, does that seem like pretty often or?

800
01:09:40,764 --> 01:09:43,224
[SPEAKER_05]: It does seem often.

801
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:46,765
[SPEAKER_07]: If we have the charter every 10 years after the first

802
01:09:48,964 --> 01:09:53,147
[SPEAKER_01]: My suggestion is we do the first one five years and just follow the charter.

803
01:09:53,787 --> 01:09:55,028
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after that, 10 years.

804
01:09:55,088 --> 01:10:00,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this probably hasn't been done in anybody's recollection that this has actually been done.

805
01:10:00,452 --> 01:10:06,036
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe we need one within five years and then 10 years after that, similar to the charter.

806
01:10:06,616 --> 01:10:07,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

807
01:10:07,477 --> 01:10:16,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to be my own devil's advocate, I'll say given that this has some or all doing it every five years could maybe be more productive because you could

808
01:10:17,393 --> 01:10:18,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, you know, I don't know.

809
01:10:18,534 --> 01:10:22,818
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just, you could cover what you didn't cover five years earlier.

810
01:10:22,838 --> 01:10:24,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, I mean, just throwing that out there.

811
01:10:31,025 --> 01:10:34,948
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think 10 years is sufficient too.

812
01:10:35,949 --> 01:10:44,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I think, you know, given the fact that there's so many things in this city that haven't happened with any regularity, I think,

813
01:10:47,437 --> 01:11:11,556
[SPEAKER_04]: having a calendar in there where things are required to happen, even if it seems, I mean, if it's every five years, then the committee can get together and maybe, you know, for argument's sake, there's 50 ordinances and maybe, you know, they only need to look at, you know, five, you know, it'll be a quick committee.

814
01:11:12,136 --> 01:11:13,938
[SPEAKER_07]: At that five year interval, they'll do that.

815
01:11:13,998 --> 01:11:15,058
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the next five years.

816
01:11:15,139 --> 01:11:15,359
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

817
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:15,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

818
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:16,840
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Aubrey.

819
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:35,526
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have a strong opinion about the years, but I think that an odd number would put it at a different point in the cycle every time it happened.

820
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:43,030
[SPEAKER_07]: And this particular text from this charter has this special committee established by ordinance.

821
01:11:43,451 --> 01:11:43,631
[SPEAKER_07]: So

822
01:11:46,146 --> 01:11:55,814
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be sort of handing over the responsibility of deciding how many people and all that to the ordinance.

823
01:11:56,614 --> 01:12:00,257
[SPEAKER_07]: The only requirement I see in here is voters, backed voters.

824
01:12:06,262 --> 01:12:06,602
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

825
01:12:06,923 --> 01:12:08,824
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this should be an ad hoc committee?

826
01:12:13,508 --> 01:12:15,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, as opposed to.

827
01:12:17,856 --> 01:12:24,079
[SPEAKER_07]: one that is created so you don't like the ordinance language?

828
01:12:24,919 --> 01:12:27,180
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm thinking out loud here.

829
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:43,908
[SPEAKER_04]: It's created by ordinance, but then every time the calendar rolls around to when the review needs to be done, then somebody would be appointing

830
01:12:44,942 --> 01:13:03,792
[SPEAKER_04]: the members of the committee, because if I serve at the five year interval and then it needs to be done five years later, you know, did serving in 2024 and then 2029 again, you know, somebody would need to be appointing a whole new committee once their work is done, you know,

831
01:13:14,094 --> 01:13:23,241
[SPEAKER_04]: it takes them six months or a year or however long to get their work done, then they don't really have a purpose until the next interval comes up.

832
01:13:24,342 --> 01:13:24,602
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

833
01:13:25,043 --> 01:13:25,943
[SPEAKER_07]: They would just be a one.

834
01:13:26,063 --> 01:13:28,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I read this as an ad hoc committee.

835
01:13:28,926 --> 01:13:33,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Once they do the review, they're done until five years later, and then it's a new committee.

836
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:34,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

837
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:37,412
[SPEAKER_04]: And made up of completely different people.

838
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:38,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

839
01:13:39,762 --> 01:13:42,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we get a ruling from the Collins Center?

840
01:13:42,123 --> 01:13:47,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it seems to me that the responsibility of a lot of this is on the city solicitor side.

841
01:13:47,566 --> 01:13:57,931
[SPEAKER_01]: And there may be some Massachusetts general laws that require a review of our ordinances on a regular basis that we're just not even aware of.

842
01:13:58,872 --> 01:13:59,572
[SPEAKER_07]: That's true.

843
01:14:03,214 --> 01:14:04,435
[SPEAKER_07]: So what do we want to do about this?

844
01:14:04,475 --> 01:14:04,975
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want to...

845
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Tell the call center we would like a periodic review of ordinances section or.

846
01:14:11,941 --> 01:14:19,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I think I heard agreement on that.

847
01:14:21,703 --> 01:14:24,884
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's obviously appointed by the city council because their ordinances.

848
01:14:25,904 --> 01:14:30,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but the mayor, you know, is involved because.

849
01:14:33,026 --> 01:14:33,906
[SPEAKER_07]: But the yeah.

850
01:14:34,582 --> 01:14:59,347
[SPEAKER_07]: two-thirds vote they can so yeah it's do we know how long it takes to review ordinances no but i but we're but we're surmising that that's one of the reasons it says some or all because um because it would may be too big of a task to actually review all of them um do we know

851
01:15:00,110 --> 01:15:03,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Who reviews ordinances?

852
01:15:03,594 --> 01:15:05,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, is it attorneys?

853
01:15:06,098 --> 01:15:07,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it people?

854
01:15:07,259 --> 01:15:16,611
[SPEAKER_02]: Ordinances could be pretty complicated and have a pretty big impact on life in Medford.

855
01:15:19,347 --> 01:15:22,109
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so what happens after they review them?

856
01:15:22,209 --> 01:15:24,811
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they give them back to the city council?

857
01:15:24,851 --> 01:15:26,652
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, do something about this?

858
01:15:26,672 --> 01:15:34,717
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't I don't really understand the process, you know, based on this particular text example that we're looking at.

859
01:15:35,433 --> 01:15:38,954
[SPEAKER_07]: The committee is established by ordinance.

860
01:15:39,695 --> 01:15:48,178
[SPEAKER_07]: They file a report with the city clerk at a date specified by the ordinance, which is basically just recommendations.

861
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:54,420
[SPEAKER_07]: But they are also under the supervision of the city solicitor.

862
01:15:54,500 --> 01:15:58,862
[SPEAKER_07]: So they work with the city solicitor to make the recommendations.

863
01:16:00,105 --> 01:16:03,246
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they present those recommendations just like we're doing.

864
01:16:03,266 --> 01:16:13,988
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't think that they have any authority to change any ordinances because they're not legislators, but it's basically an advisory body.

865
01:16:17,169 --> 01:16:27,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, I would think that, you know, especially, you know, a first review, some of them might be, you know, pretty obvious.

866
01:16:29,037 --> 01:16:36,803
[SPEAKER_04]: whether they needed to be sunset or have some sort of a revision or whatever.

867
01:16:38,384 --> 01:16:55,296
[SPEAKER_04]: But then some others where you get into the weeds, I'm sure that there would be somebody like we have the Collins Center who's steering us in the right direction, that there would be somebody

868
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,111
[SPEAKER_04]: steering them in the right direction too.

869
01:16:58,812 --> 01:17:05,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Which would be the city solicitor based on the way this particular Melrose's section is written anyway.

870
01:17:05,736 --> 01:17:14,902
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any motions on this or do we want to?

871
01:17:18,584 --> 01:17:24,888
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I make a motion that we defer to the Collins Center for advice and to

872
01:17:27,462 --> 01:17:48,771
[SPEAKER_02]: craft something that we can, you know, possibly vote on down the line, because I like to do a little more, kind of find out a little bit more about it, because I'm not prepared to vote on this, because I really don't know, you know, what the current process is for review of ordinances.

873
01:17:48,851 --> 01:17:52,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something that, you know, we're already doing by ordinance?

874
01:17:53,645 --> 01:17:54,265
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't even know.

875
01:17:54,826 --> 01:17:57,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the Collins Center won't craft.

876
01:17:58,148 --> 01:18:01,049
[SPEAKER_07]: They can craft this if we tell them what we want.

877
01:18:01,489 --> 01:18:04,671
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to say you should have a periodic review.

878
01:18:04,711 --> 01:18:08,353
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll just give us information, but they won't draft anything.

879
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:12,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they might give us a memo on how common is it.

880
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:14,517
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, is that's what you're looking for?

881
01:18:14,697 --> 01:18:18,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, how common is it for communities to have periodic reviews of ordinances?

882
01:18:19,379 --> 01:18:20,320
[SPEAKER_07]: How does it usually work?

883
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:32,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I kind of like to know if we have it now before before, like, what does the city council do now with ordinances that are outdated?

884
01:18:32,554 --> 01:18:38,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there already a process that just needs to be kind of incorporated into the charter?

885
01:18:39,485 --> 01:18:41,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they're doing anything.

886
01:18:41,146 --> 01:19:06,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anything's been done in quite some time because I think that's part of the governing agenda of the current city council that has to go through, you know, as I said, each standing committee is going to be going through ordinances that pertain to, you know, the purview of that particular standing committee.

887
01:19:07,558 --> 01:19:23,265
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's the first, I could be wrong and I don't recall anything in our two and a half page charter regarding ordinance review, but I don't think anything's been done in quite some time.

888
01:19:23,445 --> 01:19:32,489
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I don't think that it would be one of the priorities of this current city council.

889
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:34,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's doing something.

890
01:19:36,546 --> 01:19:42,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they are they're they're hoping to have gone through all of the ordinances, you know, in their 2 year term.

891
01:19:44,013 --> 01:19:46,855
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of the reason they, they change from.

892
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:54,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Weekly to every other week, so they could do this kind of work and subcommittees is that.

893
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:56,324
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?

894
01:19:56,724 --> 01:19:57,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm right.

895
01:19:58,143 --> 01:20:07,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's it and actually, you know, I've mentioned this governing agenda now a couple of times and when the city clerk put out the June schedule.

896
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:12,332
[SPEAKER_04]: For city council meetings, I believe it's on the.

897
01:20:13,513 --> 01:20:17,876
[SPEAKER_04]: 18th of June at 6 o'clock, which is next Tuesday, I think.

898
01:20:19,892 --> 01:20:30,356
[SPEAKER_04]: The Councilors are conducting a committee of the whole to look at the governing agenda, which includes a lot of things, not just this ordinance review.

899
01:20:31,056 --> 01:20:36,378
[SPEAKER_04]: It includes a lot of the work of the overall body in the standing committees.

900
01:20:36,838 --> 01:20:40,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's basically, it's been six months now.

901
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:44,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a check-in to see how this governing agenda is working.

902
01:20:44,641 --> 01:20:47,162
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be interesting to see what they say about

903
01:20:48,153 --> 01:20:50,294
[SPEAKER_04]: any ordinance review.

904
01:20:50,974 --> 01:20:55,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that they've, I mean, I watch a fair amount of subcommittee meetings.

905
01:20:55,816 --> 01:20:57,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen anything come up yet.

906
01:20:57,817 --> 01:21:01,518
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been doing other things, but be interesting to see what they say.

907
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:09,361
[SPEAKER_07]: And that said, this, if we put this in the charter, this is an ordinance review by a body that's not the city council.

908
01:21:09,441 --> 01:21:13,903
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's basically like another set of eyes on the city ordinances.

909
01:21:15,444 --> 01:21:15,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron.

910
01:21:16,909 --> 01:21:25,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we, I motioned a table, the discussion and asking her opinion from the call center and how other cities and towns and their analysis of this amendment.

911
01:21:27,614 --> 01:21:28,675
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

912
01:21:29,615 --> 01:21:30,616
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody want to second that?

913
01:21:31,516 --> 01:21:32,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll second it.

914
01:21:33,397 --> 01:21:33,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

915
01:21:34,678 --> 01:21:35,058
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron.

916
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:38,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron says yes.

917
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:41,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice.

918
01:21:42,421 --> 01:21:43,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice says yes.

919
01:21:45,263 --> 01:21:45,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony.

920
01:21:49,069 --> 01:21:49,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I say yes.

921
01:21:51,652 --> 01:21:52,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle?

922
01:21:52,973 --> 01:21:53,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

923
01:21:54,514 --> 01:21:54,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Aubrey?

924
01:21:56,195 --> 01:22:00,118
[SPEAKER_09]: No, I'm okay moving forward.

925
01:22:00,999 --> 01:22:06,484
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also a no, because I'm also okay moving forward, but the motion carries.

926
01:22:08,812 --> 01:22:19,199
[SPEAKER_07]: So that means, so that's leading me into the next, so we have about a half an hour left and there are some other, I know that there's some issues that people want to discuss in Articles 5, 9, and 10.

927
01:22:20,941 --> 01:22:23,382
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next scheduled meeting would be 4th of July.

928
01:22:23,462 --> 01:22:25,023
[SPEAKER_07]: We will not have a meeting then.

929
01:22:25,364 --> 01:22:29,867
[SPEAKER_07]: My hope, well, was that we would finalize things tonight

930
01:22:31,543 --> 01:22:35,765
[SPEAKER_07]: and the Collins Center said they will take a few weeks.

931
01:22:36,286 --> 01:22:43,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Then within the next few weeks, I would get a draft charter to everybody on the committee from the Collins Center.

932
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:54,015
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we would reconvene in August and September to go over that draft with the Collins Center and finalize it.

933
01:22:54,996 --> 01:22:59,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Since we're not going to finish tonight, I'm going to propose that we have another meeting in June.

934
01:23:03,194 --> 01:23:04,478
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we have left to vote on?

935
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:05,901
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we have this.

936
01:23:05,921 --> 01:23:10,514
[SPEAKER_07]: We have this that we just voted on getting more information on.

937
01:23:12,265 --> 01:23:24,974
[SPEAKER_07]: And potentially whatever, I know that there are some, I was about to ask what other areas of those three articles that we haven't extensively gone through and drafted that people wanted to talk about.

938
01:23:25,034 --> 01:23:26,255
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know that there are some issues.

939
01:23:26,936 --> 01:23:35,502
[SPEAKER_07]: So we could look at that and possibly finish it in half an hour, but we definitely won't get the ordinance review taken care of because we just voted to ask for more information on it.

940
01:23:36,623 --> 01:23:43,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I I've added several things in the margin for article 9 and I get and.

941
01:23:45,192 --> 01:23:50,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Article 1 appears to be mostly definitions that are, you know.

942
01:23:51,658 --> 01:23:58,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty boilerplate yeah, but article 5, I'm not quite sure what to make of that.

943
01:24:02,034 --> 01:24:08,420
[SPEAKER_04]: What you've got there, can you make it a little bit bigger, Melva, please?

944
01:24:09,461 --> 01:24:12,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Really basically has sections 5-1 and 5-2.

945
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:23,916
[SPEAKER_04]: But in going through and looking at a number of other charters, they break down that section with a lot of,

946
01:24:25,517 --> 01:24:42,789
[SPEAKER_04]: the various city departments and they talk about scope and responsibilities and so forth of the city clerk, the Department of Public Works, Department of Elections.

947
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:49,213
[SPEAKER_07]: City clerk, I think we addressed in Article 2.

948
01:24:49,794 --> 01:24:52,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just talking about what I've seen.

949
01:24:55,375 --> 01:25:01,041
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, you know, and and they get into some some boards to some of the other.

950
01:25:01,061 --> 01:25:09,650
[SPEAKER_04]: I was I did some research over the last couple of days, but I was more focusing on article 9 than anything else.

951
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:11,432
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've added a lot of things there.

952
01:25:12,673 --> 01:25:13,714
[SPEAKER_04]: To look at, but.

953
01:25:14,595 --> 01:25:17,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Kind of starting to glance at section article 5.

954
01:25:19,337 --> 01:25:22,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we can keep it as minimalistic as this is.

955
01:25:23,538 --> 01:25:26,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Or we can take a look at, you know.

956
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:29,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the others that are out there that, you know.

957
01:25:31,641 --> 01:25:33,741
[SPEAKER_04]: Do things a lot more broadly so.

958
01:25:35,502 --> 01:25:37,523
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know where we go with that.

959
01:25:39,183 --> 01:25:41,904
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, different communities do different things.

960
01:25:43,085 --> 01:25:43,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

961
01:25:45,864 --> 01:26:01,328
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I think my preference would be to keep it minimal and general and not define the bodies in the charter, because we know that changing the charter is a pretty big deal.

962
01:26:03,568 --> 01:26:12,591
[SPEAKER_04]: But I guess maybe that's another question for the Collins Center is, why do some communities do it one way and some communities do it the other?

963
01:26:14,955 --> 01:26:18,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Pro or con to doing it one way or the other.

964
01:26:23,445 --> 01:26:27,410
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think the con is that you can't change it easily when it's in the charter.

965
01:26:29,853 --> 01:26:34,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, but a number of communities actually do go pretty far into depth.

966
01:26:35,025 --> 01:26:35,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

967
01:26:36,065 --> 01:26:38,526
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe the three that they gave us don't.

968
01:26:38,607 --> 01:26:47,650
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that, so I think that they, that, you know, and when they gave us the example to sort of template, they called it the generic modern charter.

969
01:26:47,730 --> 01:27:01,376
[SPEAKER_07]: So my understanding is that we're looking at, is that they're, they're giving us sort of the most, the most recent kind of modern charter, which is,

970
01:27:04,496 --> 01:27:15,867
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe more broad so that it defines things, but it gives the electeds leeway to change those departments if they need to be changed or whatever.

971
01:27:17,369 --> 01:27:22,854
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my understanding, but... No, I see your point.

972
01:27:23,355 --> 01:27:23,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

973
01:27:26,117 --> 01:27:37,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Does anybody else have any thought about this particular section, which the example that we have, it is very short and it's pretty boilerplate language.

974
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:50,772
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, we would change Alderman, that was from another charter, but as opposed to the other option of

975
01:27:52,614 --> 01:28:03,937
[SPEAKER_07]: defining different agencies within this section, which would require a good bit of work on our part to look at, you know, and which ones would we define?

976
01:28:04,537 --> 01:28:06,618
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the other question, if we did that.

977
01:28:07,618 --> 01:28:08,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey?

978
01:28:09,599 --> 01:28:22,122
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm okay with it as is, and I appreciate the phrases in here where it says subject to express prohibitions in general law or other places in this charter.

979
01:28:22,874 --> 01:28:23,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

980
01:28:30,743 --> 01:28:32,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, any other thoughts?

981
01:28:39,353 --> 01:28:41,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Any, just any, I mean,

982
01:28:44,120 --> 01:28:59,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want to just say the call-in center, we're good with the boilerplate language of Article 5, or do we want to explore more deeply defining different agencies in this section?

983
01:29:02,229 --> 01:29:05,771
[SPEAKER_01]: I move that we just give it to the call-in center now.

984
01:29:07,212 --> 01:29:08,092
[SPEAKER_01]: I second that.

985
01:29:09,653 --> 01:29:09,773
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

986
01:29:11,997 --> 01:29:14,858
[SPEAKER_04]: with the amendment that we take out the board of aldermen and put in.

987
01:29:14,878 --> 01:29:14,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

988
01:29:15,478 --> 01:29:15,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

989
01:29:16,219 --> 01:29:17,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

990
01:29:17,879 --> 01:29:31,145
[SPEAKER_07]: So the motion, uh, tell me if we're on, if this represents your motion, um, to ask Colin century to draft article five using standard language.

991
01:29:32,745 --> 01:29:33,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

992
01:29:33,106 --> 01:29:33,366
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

993
01:29:33,386 --> 01:29:34,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that also article one?

994
01:29:40,545 --> 01:29:41,246
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right.

995
01:29:41,406 --> 01:29:42,987
[SPEAKER_07]: We can add Article 1 to that, too.

996
01:29:43,247 --> 01:29:43,387
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

997
01:29:43,407 --> 01:29:45,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that include Aubrey's statement?

998
01:29:45,208 --> 01:29:46,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that in here on Section 5?

999
01:29:46,770 --> 01:29:48,591
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm too lazy to look at it.

1000
01:29:48,971 --> 01:29:50,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's already on there.

1001
01:29:50,672 --> 01:29:50,953
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1002
01:29:51,093 --> 01:29:52,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Then that's what I would do.

1003
01:29:52,174 --> 01:30:00,059
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 and 5, I move to accept it using the template and move it to the comments section.

1004
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:00,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1005
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:01,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Ron?

1006
01:30:03,322 --> 01:30:03,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1007
01:30:04,623 --> 01:30:05,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Anthony?

1008
01:30:05,723 --> 01:30:05,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1009
01:30:06,544 --> 01:30:06,924
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey?

1010
01:30:07,645 --> 01:30:07,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1011
01:30:08,335 --> 01:30:08,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice?

1012
01:30:09,336 --> 01:30:09,576
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

1013
01:30:10,978 --> 01:30:11,478
[SPEAKER_07]: Danielle?

1014
01:30:12,399 --> 01:30:14,241
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1015
01:30:14,381 --> 01:30:15,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I say yes.

1016
01:30:16,323 --> 01:30:17,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

1017
01:30:17,905 --> 01:30:19,326
[SPEAKER_07]: So that leaves us with Article 9.

1018
01:30:21,728 --> 01:30:30,677
[SPEAKER_07]: We've already looked at, I mean, this is all very boilerplate language, but I guess,

1019
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:34,659
[SPEAKER_07]: We looked at the charter review body.

1020
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,079
[SPEAKER_07]: We've already taken care of that.

1021
01:30:36,280 --> 01:30:40,341
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what I had asked people to do was to look this over and bring up any issues.

1022
01:30:40,821 --> 01:30:43,142
[SPEAKER_07]: So now's your time to bring them up.

1023
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:49,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe Eunice can take a moment to explain her notes on the side there.

1024
01:30:49,764 --> 01:30:50,464
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to hear.

1025
01:30:50,524 --> 01:30:52,805
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, since I can't see that, I'm trying to.

1026
01:30:55,286 --> 01:30:56,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell me what section?

1027
01:30:56,506 --> 01:30:57,587
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll pull up the section.

1028
01:30:59,232 --> 01:31:02,796
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of all over the map and it was really hard for me to.

1029
01:31:03,577 --> 01:31:11,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I get the way this seems to work is that if you have more than 1 thing to say about a section, you can't kind of like.

1030
01:31:12,267 --> 01:31:17,013
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you have to find a different place to put your little comment.

1031
01:31:18,696 --> 01:31:21,059
[SPEAKER_07]: So, can I propose something?

1032
01:31:21,079 --> 01:31:22,741
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

1033
01:31:23,001 --> 01:31:25,584
[SPEAKER_07]: So, we're going to have to have another meeting in June.

1034
01:31:26,666 --> 01:31:29,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Where we're going to look at the periodic review of ordinances.

1035
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:34,055
[SPEAKER_07]: My proposal is that we use our next, say, 10 minutes to.

1036
01:31:35,258 --> 01:31:50,182
[SPEAKER_07]: get down on paper what sections in addition to the periodic review of ordinances that we want to look at, study, and learn about so that we can decide on them at the next meeting we're going to have in a couple of weeks.

1037
01:31:51,202 --> 01:31:51,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that make sense?

1038
01:31:52,743 --> 01:31:53,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1039
01:31:53,343 --> 01:31:53,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1040
01:31:54,163 --> 01:32:00,665
[SPEAKER_04]: There were some sections that are in there that I wanted

1041
01:32:01,355 --> 01:32:05,139
[SPEAKER_04]: For the discussion on and then after having gone through.

1042
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:13,887
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, 20 or 30 other charters, there were some sections that I plucked out of other charters that don't seem to be in there yet.

1043
01:32:13,987 --> 01:32:16,630
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would like to consider adding.

1044
01:32:17,581 --> 01:32:19,482
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of where I was.

1045
01:32:19,942 --> 01:32:28,107
[SPEAKER_07]: How about you tell us which sections you want to look at so we can, so we have, we're going to, we're going to look at section nine, four.

1046
01:32:28,127 --> 01:32:29,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's ordinances.

1047
01:32:30,388 --> 01:32:35,991
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you what, and I'm sorry if my back's to you, but I can see it better on desktop here.

1048
01:32:36,031 --> 01:32:44,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you of the sections that are there, what I would like for the discussion on, and then tell you what I would like added.

1049
01:32:44,715 --> 01:32:45,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1050
01:32:45,676 --> 01:32:45,876
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

1051
01:32:46,839 --> 01:32:52,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Section 9-3, which is rules and regulations.

1052
01:32:55,521 --> 01:33:00,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did the ordinances part, we did the periodic review of the charter.

1053
01:33:03,043 --> 01:33:11,965
[SPEAKER_07]: Section 9-6, which is proceed multi-member bodies.

1054
01:33:21,048 --> 01:33:24,269
[SPEAKER_04]: 98, computation of time.

1055
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:33,891
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these are just small things and other things are not so small.

1056
01:33:33,911 --> 01:33:38,012
[SPEAKER_04]: 99, also affirmations.

1057
01:33:43,894 --> 01:33:44,194
[SPEAKER_04]: That was.

1058
01:33:48,089 --> 01:33:51,532
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so go ahead.

1059
01:33:51,812 --> 01:34:08,444
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I did find in Framingham, they had a section in Article 9 about public comment.

1060
01:34:08,504 --> 01:34:10,125
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to take a look at that.

1061
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:10,185
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1062
01:34:18,676 --> 01:34:25,821
[SPEAKER_07]: So maybe we can cross one of those off the list right now if you want to.

1063
01:34:25,861 --> 01:34:28,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, for instance, computation of time is probably a quickie.

1064
01:34:28,903 --> 01:34:35,748
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I'm trying to figure out what I tried to say about that.

1065
01:34:35,768 --> 01:34:40,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK, I think that was

1066
01:34:45,543 --> 01:34:50,585
[SPEAKER_04]: something there that needs to be defined and aligned with the definition of days in Article 1.

1067
01:34:51,506 --> 01:34:51,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1068
01:34:52,186 --> 01:35:04,651
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the things the Collins Center does when they review our drafts and then draft the other articles is that they'll make sure they'll look for consistency of language and things like that.

1069
01:35:04,691 --> 01:35:10,933
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't think we have to worry so much about that because we're so fortunate to have the Collins Center.

1070
01:35:13,262 --> 01:35:15,163
[SPEAKER_07]: basically being a good editor that way.

1071
01:35:15,183 --> 01:35:22,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, can I just ask, does that mean we can cross that off the list?

1072
01:35:23,585 --> 01:35:23,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

1073
01:35:24,325 --> 01:35:28,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1074
01:35:28,146 --> 01:35:29,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.

1075
01:35:29,167 --> 01:35:36,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Then one other piece that I would like to have some discussion on, and I put something in

1076
01:35:39,002 --> 01:35:42,425
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's our miscellaneous folder that you can go through and look at.

1077
01:35:42,445 --> 01:36:03,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I put a lot of what I researched in our miscellaneous folder on a lot of these different topics, but ethics and conflict of interest and so forth, some language about that.

1078
01:36:05,116 --> 01:36:08,500
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's, I'm just trying to call that up.

1079
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,302
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a document in.

1080
01:36:10,322 --> 01:36:16,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's.

1081
01:36:17,269 --> 01:36:19,451
[SPEAKER_09]: That might be covered by Mass General Logins.

1082
01:36:21,433 --> 01:36:23,335
[SPEAKER_04]: It could be, but I found a whole lot of stuff.

1083
01:36:23,615 --> 01:36:25,077
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to take an annual training.

1084
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:29,642
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the name of the document?

1085
01:36:30,423 --> 01:36:31,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Article 1, 5, 9, 10.

1086
01:36:32,044 --> 01:36:32,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1087
01:36:32,645 --> 01:36:36,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Phyllis is back.

1088
01:36:36,669 --> 01:36:37,190
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, Phyllis.

1089
01:36:39,192 --> 01:36:44,958
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so what you've done here is you've put a bunch of examples of other charters.

1090
01:36:45,819 --> 01:36:46,179
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1091
01:36:46,419 --> 01:36:48,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1092
01:36:48,762 --> 01:36:49,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so

1093
01:36:52,384 --> 01:36:56,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, what I have is that we can all have access to that document.

1094
01:36:57,749 --> 01:37:09,438
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to have another meeting in June to discuss sections 9-3, 9-4, 9-6, and 9-9, and also a question of whether to add a section on public comment.

1095
01:37:10,259 --> 01:37:10,739
[SPEAKER_07]: And ethics.

1096
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:13,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethics and conflict of interest.

1097
01:37:15,103 --> 01:37:15,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1098
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:19,366
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm guessing that's, I think I agree with Aubrey that that's in state law.

1099
01:37:22,425 --> 01:37:24,147
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do a little bit more digging on that.

1100
01:37:25,528 --> 01:37:25,849
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1101
01:37:28,631 --> 01:37:30,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1102
01:37:30,894 --> 01:37:40,644
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice, do you think your questions or issues on any of those are basic enough that we could do them in 5-10 minutes?

1103
01:37:41,384 --> 01:37:44,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we cross one of them off the list?

1104
01:37:53,313 --> 01:37:54,474
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, wait, you're muted, Eunice.

1105
01:37:57,655 --> 01:37:58,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sorry.

1106
01:37:58,156 --> 01:37:59,096
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

1107
01:37:59,997 --> 01:38:06,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Under multi-member bodies, I'd like to add a residency section.

1108
01:38:08,121 --> 01:38:13,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1109
01:38:13,464 --> 01:38:16,506
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now, multi-member bodies is 9-6.

1110
01:38:17,006 --> 01:38:19,788
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now, I mean, this particular,

1111
01:38:21,593 --> 01:38:22,453
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me just call it up.

1112
01:38:22,573 --> 01:38:25,314
[SPEAKER_07]: The example that we have is Melrose.

1113
01:38:25,534 --> 01:38:30,296
[SPEAKER_07]: But the question for us is, what specific things do we want in that section?

1114
01:38:30,556 --> 01:38:39,539
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is pretty boilerplate, this section A.

1115
01:38:43,778 --> 01:38:46,719
[SPEAKER_07]: And so which section were you?

1116
01:38:46,739 --> 01:38:49,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Eunice, can you repeat what you said you wanted to look at?

1117
01:38:50,241 --> 01:38:53,122
[SPEAKER_04]: There is not a residency section at the moment.

1118
01:38:53,842 --> 01:39:05,547
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have over in the side there, we need to add a section on residency and then copy it and paste it from somewhere else, Fall River.

1119
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:06,588
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1120
01:39:07,548 --> 01:39:11,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Or we just decide that if the committee decides they want to do that,

1121
01:39:15,753 --> 01:39:19,656
[SPEAKER_07]: then we can just tell the call center that we want to add that.

1122
01:39:20,797 --> 01:39:26,441
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically what you want is you want a residency requirement for multi-member bodies.

1123
01:39:27,242 --> 01:39:27,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

1124
01:39:28,122 --> 01:39:32,466
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so resident as opposed because we've had this discussion resident versus voter.

1125
01:39:32,486 --> 01:39:33,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, resident as in

1126
01:39:43,413 --> 01:39:47,435
[SPEAKER_04]: To be a member of a multi-member body, you have to be a resident of Medford.

1127
01:39:47,776 --> 01:40:06,486
[SPEAKER_04]: It's come up in the past, and I brought this to the attention of the mayor a couple of years ago about a particular individual sitting on one of our boards that had been a Medford resident, moved out of the city, continued on in her role on the particular board,

1128
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:10,594
[SPEAKER_04]: making decisions for Medford when she didn't live in Medford anymore.

1129
01:40:11,074 --> 01:40:21,326
[SPEAKER_04]: When I brought it up to the mayor, I was told nothing she can do, nothing in the charter, says he had to be a resident to be, you know, a member of

1130
01:40:23,207 --> 01:40:26,449
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, a board, so... Okay.

1131
01:40:26,930 --> 01:40:39,578
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and I see a note from Frances in the chat, because she, remember, we had a question for her, and she heard her name, but she couldn't unmute, but now she maybe can unmute, and I think our question was related to this, right, for Frances?

1132
01:40:40,058 --> 01:40:41,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Anthony had that question, yeah.

1133
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it... About commissions and boards.

1134
01:40:45,922 --> 01:40:50,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, something about could city employees vote on the commissions and boards.

1135
01:40:51,826 --> 01:40:54,829
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have voting rights on the commissions and boards.

1136
01:40:54,969 --> 01:40:57,831
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a liaison to the commissions and boards.

1137
01:40:58,331 --> 01:41:06,998
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are on the commission or the board in the same manners that you have been appointed, then you would have voting rights.

1138
01:41:07,898 --> 01:41:18,947
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question was, and I brought up the example of the Human Rights Commission.

1139
01:41:21,638 --> 01:41:28,181
[SPEAKER_04]: where I believe Chief Buckley is a member of that board, and I believe he has voting rights.

1140
01:41:28,801 --> 01:41:42,066
[SPEAKER_00]: Chief Buckley is a commissioner and does have voting rights, but also that same commission also has a very strange ordinance that says something like the chair of the board does not get to vote.

1141
01:41:44,295 --> 01:41:51,746
[SPEAKER_00]: then these things precede me, but Chief Buckley is considered a commissioner on that board, but I'm not considered a commissioner.

1142
01:41:53,648 --> 01:41:55,892
[SPEAKER_04]: And my knowledge, the chief does not live in Medford.

1143
01:41:56,853 --> 01:42:07,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And we did discuss this earlier when we talked about, you know, it's just, I agree we should have restrictions, but there are scenarios that will force us to not have a paint with such a broad brush.

1144
01:42:08,403 --> 01:42:18,531
[SPEAKER_01]: If the police chief has a voting right on a board, or if the building commission has a voting right in the building department, and he doesn't, there's no rule that says he has to live in the city.

1145
01:42:19,452 --> 01:42:23,996
[SPEAKER_01]: He could live in Melrose, but still do his job and must be on that board anyway.

1146
01:42:24,036 --> 01:42:25,517
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we really have to look at that.

1147
01:42:26,526 --> 01:42:30,808
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people have to be on the boards because of the scope and rules of their job.

1148
01:42:31,368 --> 01:42:46,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let's since we're talking about Chief Buckley, if Chief Buckley was on the, I don't know, another board that really didn't have anything to let's say, do with like a policing role, that kind of stuff, then yeah, I think that you would question it.

1149
01:42:46,894 --> 01:42:51,736
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Building Commissioner being on the zoning board, I think that's important.

1150
01:42:51,776 --> 01:42:52,477
[SPEAKER_00]: That's critical.

1151
01:42:52,957 --> 01:42:55,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Who else is going to provide the legal guidance that's needed?

1152
01:42:56,648 --> 01:42:56,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1153
01:42:58,689 --> 01:42:59,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey, did you have your hand up?

1154
01:43:01,230 --> 01:43:11,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to add that I think in sections where we feel we do have specific references to either resident or voter in sections where we think that it matters.

1155
01:43:13,436 --> 01:43:13,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1156
01:43:17,738 --> 01:43:22,180
[SPEAKER_07]: For particular bodies, like for instance, yeah, so.

1157
01:43:25,185 --> 01:43:39,377
[SPEAKER_07]: So Eunice, I mean, did you want, so we've had a discussion about should we add the requirement that you're talking about in section 96, the uniform procedures governing multiple member bodies.

1158
01:43:41,499 --> 01:43:46,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to make a motion or?

1159
01:43:47,688 --> 01:44:08,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think in listening to the discussion and things like that, I think there are circumstances where, you know, and maybe we can finesse it a bit, where it's perfectly appropriate and right for somebody who may

1160
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:33,456
[SPEAKER_04]: offer a particular expertise or role or something, you know, and I'm just sort of, you know, thinking out loud here where they're being a member of a particular board and not a resident of the city is not only appropriate, but.

1161
01:44:34,708 --> 01:44:54,019
[SPEAKER_04]: essential, maybe required by ordinance or at least essential versus, you know, if I sign up for the garden committee because I like to, you know, plant roses and all of a sudden I, you know, move to Wakefield, should I still be a member of Medford's garden committee?

1162
01:44:54,660 --> 01:44:57,021
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't think so.

1163
01:44:57,741 --> 01:44:58,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Me personally.

1164
01:45:00,003 --> 01:45:01,804
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that

1165
01:45:03,896 --> 01:45:22,594
[SPEAKER_04]: people that are serving on these boards and commissions because they might have a particular interest in the topic should relieve themselves of a role on a board or commission when they leave the city.

1166
01:45:23,234 --> 01:45:27,198
[SPEAKER_04]: It's somebody like the building commissioner or the chief or somebody that

1167
01:45:29,862 --> 01:45:35,505
[SPEAKER_04]: offers us a particular expertise or by ordinance, then I think that's a very different story.

1168
01:45:36,765 --> 01:45:58,596
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think as far as being a resident versus being a voter, I would argue that everybody should be, everybody except those specific instances, like the building commissioner or whatever, should be a resident.

1169
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:10,809
[SPEAKER_04]: in order to participate in anything regarding how Medford operates.

1170
01:46:11,690 --> 01:46:21,458
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether you're a voter or not, I think, you know, could be up for discussion, but, you know, you should at least be a resident of the community.

1171
01:46:22,379 --> 01:46:22,759
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1172
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:24,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey, did you want to?

1173
01:46:24,181 --> 01:46:25,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I say something?

1174
01:46:25,742 --> 01:46:26,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Aubrey and then Anthony.

1175
01:46:30,526 --> 01:46:37,990
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I said this earlier and I think it applies here to that.

1176
01:46:39,431 --> 01:46:45,675
[SPEAKER_09]: To be on these, I think there is some hurdle to like an application or some kind of appointment that needs to happen.

1177
01:46:45,715 --> 01:46:52,218
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not just you want to and then you get to and so I'm trusting in that process to be.

1178
01:46:52,238 --> 01:46:58,302
[SPEAKER_09]: To make good decisions about who ends up on these boards.

1179
01:46:59,861 --> 01:47:00,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Aubrey.

1180
01:47:00,682 --> 01:47:04,144
[SPEAKER_07]: So Anthony, and then we got to wrap this up, Anthony.

1181
01:47:05,205 --> 01:47:27,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to kind of chime in with that, if you just look at like a commission, like the public health commission, where it may be difficult to get a doctor or a nurse practitioner, you know, who's a Methodist resident willing to serve on a board like that, if there's someone with expertise that could benefit the community,

1182
01:47:28,288 --> 01:47:38,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, you know, I, I think that, you know, residency is not a, is, is not, you know, necessarily in the best interest of the community.

1183
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:43,806
[SPEAKER_02]: It's if we have people who, who can, you know, serve.

1184
01:47:44,391 --> 01:47:51,854
[SPEAKER_02]: The city in a willing to, you know, these are these most of these are non paid positions, and some of them are very important.

1185
01:47:51,894 --> 01:47:59,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, the director of public health, I think it's Dr platelets who happens to be a resident now, but, you know.

1186
01:47:59,957 --> 01:48:11,925
[SPEAKER_02]: There may be other times where, you know, a local doctor isn't available or something with, you know, the environment where you need, you know, someone with a real specific scientific background.

1187
01:48:11,945 --> 01:48:15,507
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it needs to be in the charter.

1188
01:48:15,827 --> 01:48:22,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the mayor can, you know, try to get, like Audrey said, you know, the appropriate people.

1189
01:48:22,932 --> 01:48:29,456
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they have an expertise, just because somebody leaves the city, you know, we shouldn't lose that experience.

1190
01:48:29,929 --> 01:48:47,880
[SPEAKER_02]: and expertise, you know, maybe, you know, they can be asked, you know, if there's someone else, you know, to, you know, not to renew the term, but I don't know, I think we should, you know, I don't think we're overflowing with, you know, expertise in City Hall right now.

1191
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:53,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should try to, you know, keep, you know, what we have.

1192
01:48:54,895 --> 01:48:55,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

1193
01:48:55,957 --> 01:48:57,319
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've had a good discussion.

1194
01:48:57,339 --> 01:49:02,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Eunice, do you want to make a motion or how do we want, do we want to?

1195
01:49:04,779 --> 01:49:10,963
[SPEAKER_04]: To just go to something that Aubrey said a minute ago about, you know, people applying for these positions.

1196
01:49:11,584 --> 01:49:30,758
[SPEAKER_04]: My sort of point in all of this wasn't so much that, you know, although I do see Anthony's point about the expertise part, you know, so much about people, you know, somebody from, you know, Wakefield applying to be on one of our boards, it was more of a,

1197
01:49:32,218 --> 01:49:44,572
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody who is a current Medford resident and then leaves the city for whatever reason and chooses to, does not step down.

1198
01:49:45,813 --> 01:49:47,675
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were originally a resident.

1199
01:49:51,831 --> 01:49:57,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, clearly this hasn't gotten any traction.

1200
01:49:57,353 --> 01:50:03,396
[SPEAKER_04]: So it clearly seems to be the will of the group not to include this.

1201
01:50:03,576 --> 01:50:05,256
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll just leave it at that then.

1202
01:50:05,276 --> 01:50:09,138
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can make a motion.

1203
01:50:09,158 --> 01:50:10,559
[SPEAKER_04]: We can vote on it.

1204
01:50:10,579 --> 01:50:11,499
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to you.

1205
01:50:12,019 --> 01:50:13,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm clearly outnumbered.

1206
01:50:13,620 --> 01:50:18,082
[SPEAKER_04]: So it clearly is something that most people aren't interested in.

1207
01:50:20,288 --> 01:50:21,028
[SPEAKER_04]: solve the idea.

1208
01:50:21,489 --> 01:50:21,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1209
01:50:22,189 --> 01:50:23,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there anything else?

1210
01:50:23,529 --> 01:50:24,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a point of information.

1211
01:50:24,870 --> 01:50:26,130
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're all interested.

1212
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:27,751
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've expressed opinions.

1213
01:50:28,231 --> 01:50:30,272
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that it's very different.

1214
01:50:30,332 --> 01:50:31,793
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand what you're trying to do.

1215
01:50:31,873 --> 01:50:33,813
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's very difficult to do.

1216
01:50:34,334 --> 01:50:38,175
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that, you know, everybody is trying to do the right thing.

1217
01:50:38,215 --> 01:50:40,416
[SPEAKER_01]: And this just maybe may not go.

1218
01:50:42,677 --> 01:50:44,698
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it's too strong to ask.

1219
01:50:45,564 --> 01:50:48,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think that we limit ourselves sometimes.

1220
01:50:48,086 --> 01:50:51,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm almost in full agreement with you.

1221
01:50:51,628 --> 01:50:53,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love everyone to be from the city.

1222
01:50:54,771 --> 01:51:00,555
[SPEAKER_08]: But realistically speaking, I think we miss good opportunities when we do limit it to that.

1223
01:51:01,195 --> 01:51:09,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though I agree with you on that part, Eunice, I would hope that everyone we needed could be from the city, but I don't think that happens.

1224
01:51:09,702 --> 01:51:14,346
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think the intent is for these bodies to be filled with Medford residents.

1225
01:51:14,406 --> 01:51:18,570
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the case that it wouldn't happen, it would be rare.

1226
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:21,192
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, so.

1227
01:51:22,013 --> 01:51:22,393
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

1228
01:51:22,853 --> 01:51:23,934
[SPEAKER_08]: Was there anything else?

1229
01:51:24,174 --> 01:51:29,139
[SPEAKER_08]: We could say, as best as possible, if this could be filled by a resident.

1230
01:51:29,379 --> 01:51:34,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we could make a statement that we would prefer Medford residents, if possible.

1231
01:51:34,944 --> 01:51:35,844
[SPEAKER_08]: We could do that.

1232
01:51:38,872 --> 01:51:42,095
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we want to vote on that?

1233
01:51:43,496 --> 01:52:03,315
[SPEAKER_04]: I would make a motion to include a section on residency to state that wherever possible, positions on multi-member boards and commissions be filled by Medford residents.

1234
01:52:05,325 --> 01:52:06,786
[SPEAKER_08]: Second that, wherever possible.

1235
01:52:07,026 --> 01:52:09,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Wherever possible is very vague.

1236
01:52:09,207 --> 01:52:11,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, I mean, you know.

1237
01:52:12,769 --> 01:52:13,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it really, Melva?

1238
01:52:14,770 --> 01:52:16,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like some information on that.

1239
01:52:16,631 --> 01:52:17,971
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean that sincerely.

1240
01:52:18,812 --> 01:52:21,493
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounds vague to me, but I don't know what it means.

1241
01:52:21,553 --> 01:52:26,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if I read that, I would be like, I don't know what that exactly means, but I mean.

1242
01:52:26,075 --> 01:52:33,899
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a majority of commissions and boards will have a majority of

1243
01:52:34,969 --> 01:52:37,452
[SPEAKER_02]: could be comprised of a majority of Medford residents.

1244
01:52:38,093 --> 01:52:42,437
[SPEAKER_02]: So they may be like more than two from outside, but you know, the majority will be.

1245
01:52:43,518 --> 01:52:45,440
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I just, I really do it.

1246
01:52:45,480 --> 01:52:46,701
[SPEAKER_07]: We do have to end in two minutes.

1247
01:52:46,781 --> 01:52:53,828
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's keep this on the list and let's put it, let's finish this discussion at our next meeting.

1248
01:52:55,895 --> 01:52:58,757
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so let's schedule that.

1249
01:52:59,337 --> 01:53:02,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to propose that today is June 6th.

1250
01:53:02,398 --> 01:53:04,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to propose June 20th.

1251
01:53:05,980 --> 01:53:06,940
[SPEAKER_07]: How are people with that?

1252
01:53:06,960 --> 01:53:07,000
[SPEAKER_07]: 20th.

1253
01:53:07,240 --> 01:53:09,281
[SPEAKER_07]: To wrap everything up?

1254
01:53:10,341 --> 01:53:11,782
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a Thursday evening, right?

1255
01:53:12,422 --> 01:53:17,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, or next week.

1256
01:53:17,304 --> 01:53:18,025
[SPEAKER_07]: We could do June 13th.

1257
01:53:20,557 --> 01:53:29,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I will just note for next week that, you know, Tuesday night, the mayor is presenting her budget at the city council meeting Tuesday night.
