1
00:00:00,271 --> 00:00:00,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Go ahead, Tom.

2
00:00:00,611 --> 00:00:06,215
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, we'll come to order, and Doug has sent the Secretary's Minutes.

3
00:00:06,776 --> 00:00:08,457
[SPEAKER_03]: As usual, I don't have any comments.

4
00:00:08,677 --> 00:00:11,399
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody else does, then we'll get a motion to approve them.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Corrections?

6
00:00:14,642 --> 00:00:15,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Deletions?

7
00:00:17,103 --> 00:00:20,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll take a motion to approve the Secretary's Minutes.

8
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:23,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion approved.

9
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:23,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

10
00:00:24,128 --> 00:00:24,749
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

11
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:25,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:25,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

13
00:00:26,915 --> 00:00:30,899
[SPEAKER_03]: So financial report, and I want to talk about Mike Oliver very briefly.

14
00:00:33,862 --> 00:00:43,731
[SPEAKER_03]: I sent the usual based on information from him on the balances, I sent the usual snapshot, which hasn't changed much since the last time around.

15
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:50,257
[SPEAKER_03]: The net is we're about taking away the obligations and the money that's

16
00:00:51,545 --> 00:00:58,170
[SPEAKER_03]: sequestered for the CPA, we're about somewhere over $36,000, which is usually about where we are.

17
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually takes time to spend money.

18
00:01:05,034 --> 00:01:08,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug has just sent me the Banesh invoice.

19
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:14,601
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not sure the numbers here are exactly right in terms of the access drive project.

20
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:17,303
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll talk to you about that Doug offline there.

21
00:01:17,323 --> 00:01:18,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I just got it 25 seconds ago.

22
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:25,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so there's a couple things.

23
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:27,562
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about it very briefly on the CPI.

24
00:01:27,582 --> 00:01:30,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to get hung up too much on the CPC because we've got a lot on the agenda.

25
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:34,145
[SPEAKER_03]: So any questions about this?

26
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:38,928
[SPEAKER_03]: I put down some obligations, minor obligations coming up fairly soon.

27
00:01:38,948 --> 00:01:47,673
[SPEAKER_00]: Tom, there was really just one is that we've had, I don't know, is it $4,000 or $5,000 that had been set aside back when we were putting the bond together?

28
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:50,584
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like that money is never going to go in that direction.

29
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:55,785
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we legally just put that in our general fund and close out that that whole thing?

30
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:57,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I think so.

31
00:01:57,705 --> 00:02:01,446
[SPEAKER_03]: The account is just an ordinary account.

32
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:02,806
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's our definition.

33
00:02:03,307 --> 00:02:09,328
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we started that at a time where we're hoping to support the the bond money with our own capital.

34
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:11,599
[SPEAKER_03]: money, and that obviously didn't happen.

35
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,120
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just kind of been sitting there.

36
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:25,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mentioned this because I think I sent around a copy of the April statement, which comes to my address and has May Markabrek's name on it at Brookline Bank.

37
00:02:25,351 --> 00:02:31,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So that, you know, that would be a pretty good piece of housekeeping, I think, in terms of

38
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:41,954
[SPEAKER_03]: integrating that, because one can always do that again if the need, well, the need's there, obviously, but if the timing arrives.

39
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:50,960
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so it sounds like we're gonna consolidate the counts and put them on, obviously, under another name that is not named Marker-Barker as part of this transition.

40
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:56,504
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to mention, I did send an email to the board, but Carly didn't hear this yet.

41
00:02:58,226 --> 00:03:02,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Mike Oliver, with whom we've worked, has been very good to us as the assistant treasurer.

42
00:03:02,728 --> 00:03:17,815
[SPEAKER_03]: He handles the banking deposits, handles the, excuse me, paying and sending checks for various vendors, reimburses people, mostly myself, for a number of expenses on behalf of Enbelt.

43
00:03:18,755 --> 00:03:24,518
[SPEAKER_03]: He has said that, I'm happy to hear this, actually, that he'll continue till the end of this fiscal year, which is the end of 2024.

44
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:28,691
[SPEAKER_03]: So that gives you a little breathing room there.

45
00:03:29,071 --> 00:03:34,954
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had suggested, and you can make this part of a longer conversation.

46
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:41,698
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want, I'm happy to continue checking the P.O.

47
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:48,001
[SPEAKER_03]: box for an indeterminate time, because we have a good system set up for that.

48
00:03:49,162 --> 00:03:49,702
[SPEAKER_03]: The P.O.

49
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:50,182
[SPEAKER_03]: box is

50
00:03:51,923 --> 00:03:54,685
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the kind of thing where you, you know, you physically got to go there.

51
00:03:54,725 --> 00:04:08,137
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, we do, we do, we do get a certain percentage of, of increasing percentage of money on the PayPal.

52
00:04:08,177 --> 00:04:13,021
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have questions, I talk too much, as you already know, cause we spent too much.

53
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:15,923
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to listen first, but I'll let you know any questions later.

54
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:17,344
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, so let's,

55
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a motion to approve the financial report.

56
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:25,135
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to approve financials.

57
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:25,995
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

58
00:04:26,035 --> 00:04:26,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

59
00:04:27,596 --> 00:04:28,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

60
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:29,818
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor, okay.

61
00:04:30,158 --> 00:04:30,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

62
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:31,199
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

63
00:04:31,499 --> 00:04:31,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

64
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:31,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

65
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:32,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

66
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

67
00:04:37,523 --> 00:04:40,765
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can briefly talk about the CPA projects.

68
00:04:41,026 --> 00:04:47,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug told me we had a conversation today that the memoranda, that's plural, right?

69
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:54,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Memoranda of understanding, which have been delayed for months and months, are now forthcoming.

70
00:04:54,155 --> 00:04:58,557
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be able to proceed on these projects.

71
00:05:00,078 --> 00:05:04,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a brief review, so Carly also knows what's on the list.

72
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:15,744
[SPEAKER_03]: In no particular order, one is the Grove Street landscaping project, which if people want, I'm happy to carry forward.

73
00:05:17,656 --> 00:05:32,007
[SPEAKER_03]: The second thing is the phase two of the invasives removal, which is going to require some, because so much time has gone by, some further investigation as to where the best place to spend that money in terms of the physical landscape.

74
00:05:34,555 --> 00:05:51,239
[SPEAKER_03]: of parts consolidated from two grants work on the east elevation of the manor, which also includes what we're calling the ADA entrance end of things.

75
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:57,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we've done before with the manor projects, it makes a lot of sense.

76
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,961
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug would agree with this, makes a lot of sense to

77
00:06:02,627 --> 00:06:07,448
[SPEAKER_03]: put those together to get some, one hopes a little better bidding efficiency.

78
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:12,809
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also, yeah, I'll get to that.

79
00:06:12,829 --> 00:06:14,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think I'm missing any others.

80
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:24,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, the interior project, which involved, I know this has been going on for ages, involved the lighting and the drapes, et cetera.

81
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:26,331
[SPEAKER_03]: That's still hung up.

82
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:27,631
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still about $7,000 sitting that we,

83
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,120
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been an escrow for trying to finish that.

84
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:46,465
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had no luck at all getting anybody to bid on the other pieces of it and have not found the very rare red French marble for the fireplace.

85
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:54,329
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'll need some attention, but we've done the majority of that.

86
00:06:54,949 --> 00:06:57,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else I missed?

87
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug, you want to talk about the access drive?

88
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:02,854
[SPEAKER_03]: or not?

89
00:07:03,335 --> 00:07:03,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I do.

90
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:06,317
[SPEAKER_00]: We received the final drawings today.

91
00:07:06,537 --> 00:07:07,858
[SPEAKER_00]: They've completed it.

92
00:07:07,898 --> 00:07:08,858
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the renderings.

93
00:07:09,058 --> 00:07:14,622
[SPEAKER_00]: I can share my screen briefly and show you guys what it looks like to see if you can get a sense of it.

94
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,404
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it looks good.

95
00:07:18,544 --> 00:07:26,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, they had to go back and incorporate a bunch of city input over the last six or eight months.

96
00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:31,112
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dealing with the potential future Oak Grove expansion.

97
00:07:31,153 --> 00:07:31,773
[SPEAKER_00]: We're dealing with

98
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:40,682
[SPEAKER_00]: just coordination between how Oak Grove would cross the access drive, some of the comments this board made about lighting and other things.

99
00:07:42,023 --> 00:07:45,705
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me share this screen briefly and I'll try to get this.

100
00:07:46,345 --> 00:07:47,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

101
00:08:07,557 --> 00:08:11,179
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the drawings that we received today.

102
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:32,771
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happened is we started to incorporate the seven acres of the estate that is not part of the Brooks Estate, it's part of the future cemetery expansion, and what that means for how to connect them on the drives, which we didn't have originally because we actually weren't sure this was ever going to happen, so we didn't spend the time to design it.

103
00:08:34,553 --> 00:08:35,513
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done that.

104
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:51,199
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been some edits up here on the... I'm going to jump to the end because those are the prettier drawings, if you will, that have the renderings of the entry and the landscaping.

105
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,540
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the entry here off of Grove Street.

106
00:08:55,281 --> 00:08:59,522
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming in here, this is the sweep that gets you connected to the Oak Grove Cemetery.

107
00:09:00,043 --> 00:09:01,043
[SPEAKER_00]: You go a little further up,

108
00:09:01,748 --> 00:09:03,088
[SPEAKER_00]: we ended up moving the gate.

109
00:09:03,108 --> 00:09:04,409
[SPEAKER_00]: The gate used to be here.

110
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:11,991
[SPEAKER_00]: Gate got pushed further back because we needed to allow the Oak Grove and the cemetery expansion to connect across.

111
00:09:12,272 --> 00:09:15,533
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a complete redesign of this portion of the road.

112
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:22,035
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our gate which closes off from dawn to dusk, which is what this area is here.

113
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:31,058
[SPEAKER_00]: The next drawing is the final revised one showing the manor carriage house, the drive going back here sweeping along to the

114
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:44,031
[SPEAKER_00]: parking lot, which now has the loop road built into it, and this ADA path that meanders down to the carriage house and manor, which has been extended.

115
00:09:44,091 --> 00:09:50,537
[SPEAKER_00]: This now has bollards along it rather than light poles, so it's a lot less intrusive.

116
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:55,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, you'll never see this parking lot from the manor or carriage house because it's screened by

117
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:00,313
[SPEAKER_00]: It's below grade.

118
00:10:00,513 --> 00:10:02,334
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have any sight lines.

119
00:10:02,414 --> 00:10:05,777
[SPEAKER_00]: It's well screened by a berm and these trees and plantings.

120
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:09,400
[SPEAKER_00]: So all these cars, there's fewer spaces than we had.

121
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:09,840
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have 50.

122
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,363
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have 44 because we made some changes.

123
00:10:14,423 --> 00:10:15,584
[SPEAKER_00]: We consolidated things.

124
00:10:15,604 --> 00:10:17,866
[SPEAKER_00]: We needed this drive, which took out a few spaces.

125
00:10:19,647 --> 00:10:24,051
[SPEAKER_00]: And 44, we still think, is enough to get what we need.

126
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:26,608
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the final design now.

127
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,809
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what they're pricing.

128
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:46,720
[SPEAKER_00]: I have final pricing, but it was so high that I hesitate to share it in any detail with you right now, because it's literally millions of dollars higher than, I guess, even my worst case scenario thought it was.

129
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:49,862
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to put it out there.

130
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:50,963
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like they're

131
00:10:51,827 --> 00:10:58,331
[SPEAKER_00]: They still have contingency of 10%, which for drawings this detailed, I think should be more like two.

132
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:02,913
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's adding like over 700,000 to that estimate.

133
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:11,258
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to put this out to the public until I feel like we've picked the tires and pushed back on things.

134
00:11:11,818 --> 00:11:12,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

135
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:13,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Defensible number, yeah.

136
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask a question, Doug?

137
00:11:16,781 --> 00:11:18,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe this will collide in the next item.

138
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:32,505
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual physical footprint of the parking, is that now less than it was in the original 50 parking area?

139
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:34,306
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.

140
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:37,969
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we lost a few at the end to make the geometry.

141
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:40,271
[SPEAKER_00]: This road back here didn't exist.

142
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,672
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to have dead end parking.

143
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:43,414
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we built this road,

144
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:45,720
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a one-way system.

145
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's supposed to be one way in and one way out.

146
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:54,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, the fire department, this was their insistence.

147
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:55,182
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good design.

148
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:58,863
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bad idea to have two lanes out for any parking lot.

149
00:11:59,504 --> 00:12:08,286
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we added almost 500 linear feet of road, which is not cheap along here.

150
00:12:08,426 --> 00:12:10,167
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that it's more expensive,

151
00:12:11,338 --> 00:12:16,400
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we're looking at right now north of 4Million dollars for this whole thing and I'm trying to get this.

152
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:24,004
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I was hoping to get it in the 3 something range right now, but right now I'm not having much success.

153
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:27,005
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is not my area of expertise landscape.

154
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:32,088
[SPEAKER_00]: And civil engineering X, you know, cost per square foot or per linear for it or.

155
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:36,686
[SPEAKER_00]: for a cubic yard is I don't have any areas of expertise in that.

156
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:44,268
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the full access drive with utilities?

157
00:12:45,388 --> 00:12:50,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, everything, including the parking lot access drive and utilities.

158
00:12:51,150 --> 00:13:00,792
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally between two and three times what it was even 10 years ago, which still seems high to me, even with inflation for the last 11 years and COVID.

159
00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:16,037
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a lot of money right now, and I don't want to scare the city to death by having the cost of this road be something that's unachievable even with a bond.

160
00:13:16,057 --> 00:13:19,438
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's a much bigger bond than we even asked for 10, 14 years ago.

161
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,618
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the parking lot the stone pack?

162
00:13:28,657 --> 00:13:29,597
[SPEAKER_00]: They have an estimate.

163
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:33,218
[SPEAKER_00]: I just haven't been able to go into the details, Tom.

164
00:13:33,318 --> 00:13:42,021
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they gave us the cost estimate for the final, but I haven't had time.

165
00:13:42,581 --> 00:13:47,522
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally started opening it about an hour and a half ago, and I just haven't been able to get into all the numbers.

166
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:55,464
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe I'll suggest that we use that as a segue to the next item, which is the...

167
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:56,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a question.

168
00:13:57,789 --> 00:13:58,250
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

169
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:03,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Doug, can you go back to the slide of the beginning of the road?

170
00:14:03,891 --> 00:14:08,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you say the gate is going to be moved from Grove Street?

171
00:14:08,792 --> 00:14:11,633
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the gate was always in from Grove Street.

172
00:14:11,693 --> 00:14:16,934
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually never right at Grove Street because you need to allow cars to come into the space.

173
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:20,195
[SPEAKER_00]: If the gate's there, they need to be able to do a three-point turn and get out.

174
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:24,656
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have a gate at the end of that Grove Street because

175
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,162
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unsafe.

176
00:14:27,243 --> 00:14:27,763
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unique.

177
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:28,923
[SPEAKER_06]: So that will be going away?

178
00:14:28,943 --> 00:14:30,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

179
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,884
[SPEAKER_00]: The gate is just further in than it is.

180
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I can open up that drawing again.

181
00:14:35,485 --> 00:14:36,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on a second.

182
00:14:37,186 --> 00:14:39,347
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I've got a question after we're done answering this one as well.

183
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:41,827
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

184
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:44,408
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the entrance here.

185
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:45,209
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's Grove Street.

186
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:46,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the entrance.

187
00:14:46,089 --> 00:14:47,009
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the gate, yeah.

188
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:49,650
[SPEAKER_00]: The gate used to be where my cursor is right here.

189
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait a minute.

190
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:52,451
[SPEAKER_00]: It was always that you came in.

191
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:54,872
[SPEAKER_00]: If the gate was closed, you could do a three-point turn here.

192
00:14:55,617 --> 00:14:58,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought the gate was at the very beginning at the left.

193
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:04,184
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be right now.

194
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:06,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now it's there, but it's going to go away.

195
00:15:07,207 --> 00:15:09,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and right now it's back here.

196
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:14,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so there's an indentation there that is different.

197
00:15:16,495 --> 00:15:22,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there, that's the stub over to the potential cemetery expansion.

198
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:29,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that is part of the Brooks estate, the creation of the Brooks estate.

199
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:42,385
[SPEAKER_00]: We could not get the entire estate, so we had to put aside seven acres of expansion, essentially where the stump dump is, and a little bit closer to Grove Street, but it's still buffered by 100 feet of setback in Grove Street, so you'll never see it.

200
00:15:42,405 --> 00:15:44,806
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is something that is a back of life.

201
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:46,528
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

202
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:50,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I make one other point about moving the gate, and that is,

203
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:55,690
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just the turnaround, but it's on a bad curve there on Grove Street.

204
00:15:56,391 --> 00:16:03,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we can all say that Grove Street has certainly gotten a lot busier, as Jen knows, in the last five, 10 years.

205
00:16:03,554 --> 00:16:04,715
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it's like a speedway.

206
00:16:05,155 --> 00:16:09,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's a speedway, and it's almost, the site distance is not, but this is much, much safer.

207
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:20,463
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, you know, we'll, but we'll still give us what we want in terms of control of the site and nighttime security, et cetera.

208
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:22,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Carly had a question.

209
00:16:24,129 --> 00:16:24,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

210
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:26,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Audrey, were you finished with yours before I jump in?

211
00:16:26,231 --> 00:16:26,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

212
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:26,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

213
00:16:26,912 --> 00:16:27,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

214
00:16:27,352 --> 00:16:28,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

215
00:16:28,933 --> 00:16:43,725
[SPEAKER_04]: On the cost piece of it, I don't want to belabor this too much because I think it might have its own conversation later, but I'm curious about if this is coming from one quote right now and if we've shopped around or what that process has looked like so far.

216
00:16:44,562 --> 00:16:45,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Good question.

217
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:50,744
[SPEAKER_00]: This has done an in-house cost estimate from Benesh Engineering, the people who are doing the drawings.

218
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:58,467
[SPEAKER_00]: They're telling me they're pulling data from their current projects and mass dot and other things for each of the categories.

219
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:00,127
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've still got to drill down.

220
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:05,449
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that it's just too conservative right now.

221
00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:12,692
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can skim off some of the contingency, but the reality is this, say it was 4 million or 3.5,

222
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,401
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not going to build this road today, right?

223
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:17,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.

224
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:27,043
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it'll go up 100 and 200,000 a year, it will get to that point very quickly with, if we don't build it immediately.

225
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:29,964
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always more expensive to build tomorrow than it is today.

226
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:35,265
[SPEAKER_00]: And the further tomorrow is, the bigger that delta is, as everyone knows, who's tried it.

227
00:17:36,486 --> 00:17:40,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And Benesch Engineering is our definite builder of this.

228
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:40,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any

229
00:17:42,517 --> 00:17:44,398
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the designers.

230
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,559
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to build it.

231
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,660
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have to bid it out.

232
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, that makes sense.

233
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:49,580
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

234
00:17:49,841 --> 00:17:50,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

235
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:55,403
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a landscape architect who did this rendering, and they have historic experience.

236
00:17:55,443 --> 00:17:57,364
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they got this job as a consultant.

237
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,505
[SPEAKER_00]: So Binesh is a city consultant.

238
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:02,787
[SPEAKER_00]: They use a lot of civil engineering in the city.

239
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:09,110
[SPEAKER_00]: But I still have a sticker shot because I just think it's crazy.

240
00:18:09,722 --> 00:18:10,342
[SPEAKER_04]: I can see why.

241
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:10,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

242
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:12,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

243
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:13,324
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes more sense.

244
00:18:13,364 --> 00:18:15,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

245
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:17,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on.

246
00:18:17,987 --> 00:18:19,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Zach has some comments.

247
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Just wanted to throw something in about the expansion.

248
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:28,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim McGivern did bring it up in his budget hearing last night as something that is a priority for them.

249
00:18:31,055 --> 00:18:32,056
[SPEAKER_02]: It may be happening.

250
00:18:32,096 --> 00:18:35,378
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no timeline or anything, but it was raised in a public meeting.

251
00:18:35,598 --> 00:18:36,339
[SPEAKER_01]: What was that?

252
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:40,618
[SPEAKER_02]: The expansion, the Parcel B cemetery expansion.

253
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:48,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yes, I've heard that the cemetery is quickly talking about making that reality.

254
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,346
[SPEAKER_01]: Chomping at the bit.

255
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:52,348
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna be horrible.

256
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:54,629
[SPEAKER_02]: They're running out of space.

257
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:55,650
[SPEAKER_01]: They're out of space.

258
00:18:56,691 --> 00:18:59,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and this was true a couple years ago too.

259
00:18:59,453 --> 00:19:00,474
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like...

260
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:04,666
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen this coming for a while.

261
00:19:04,686 --> 00:19:08,587
[SPEAKER_06]: There's several huge pieces of land that they haven't used yet.

262
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:11,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Where?

263
00:19:13,729 --> 00:19:14,609
[SPEAKER_06]: I see it all the time.

264
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:18,611
[SPEAKER_06]: There's big lawns that haven't been done yet.

265
00:19:19,211 --> 00:19:21,452
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think there's more to it than not.

266
00:19:21,492 --> 00:19:24,273
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that there's some unmarked graves in a bunch of sites.

267
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:30,275
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think they're going to go here because this is going to be this outline of a seven-acre parcel.

268
00:19:31,259 --> 00:19:35,221
[SPEAKER_00]: is going to be incredibly expensive to develop.

269
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that all ledge?

270
00:19:36,602 --> 00:19:37,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it all?

271
00:19:37,402 --> 00:19:38,603
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ledge there.

272
00:19:38,823 --> 00:19:40,544
[SPEAKER_00]: And they should build a mausoleum.

273
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:41,564
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be smart about it.

274
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:42,825
[SPEAKER_00]: But I don't know if they're going to be.

275
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:46,907
[SPEAKER_00]: But if they're just going to do more of the same, they're not going to get many graves here.

276
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:47,607
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just not.

277
00:19:49,608 --> 00:20:00,294
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the fact is, because we talked about it with them, you know, yea, these many years, is that when they did the last major lawn expansion there,

278
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,062
[SPEAKER_03]: on the other side of the pond, that was an ideal place.

279
00:20:04,343 --> 00:20:12,088
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, they looked at it to do a mausoleum, which is what modern cemeteries are doing, but they didn't wanna do it.

280
00:20:12,329 --> 00:20:23,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's probably, as there was with the original battle to preserve the Berks estate, there's definitely a monument lobby out there, let's just put it that way.

281
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:27,860
[SPEAKER_03]: And the mausoleum doesn't do much for the monument business.

282
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:37,922
[SPEAKER_00]: I would agree with that, but I think we are talking 25 years later, and I think those people have a lot less influence.

283
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:38,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no, no.

284
00:20:38,723 --> 00:20:39,844
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been first to say it.

285
00:20:39,884 --> 00:20:40,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:56,012
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also made the case that, just for historical reference here, we were open, we preferred to do flat headstones to try to keep the open landscape and the open feel of things, because that's a much different look than a bunch of, you know, stone.

287
00:20:57,619 --> 00:20:59,020
[SPEAKER_00]: going as far as the eye can see.

288
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:06,987
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, I think there's design opportunities that should be worth revisiting 20 plus years later when this is developed.

289
00:21:07,027 --> 00:21:09,389
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to, it needs to be kind of a reset.

290
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:22,240
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the city needs to look at it with the mausoleum, with flat headstones and any, any other possibilities that would make this much more integrated and not feel like an alien ship has landed in this part of the estate.

291
00:21:23,221 --> 00:21:23,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

292
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:29,852
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good conversation with McGivern and frankly, the planning department.

293
00:21:29,892 --> 00:21:31,133
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a planning project.

294
00:21:31,193 --> 00:21:32,394
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just a cemetery.

295
00:21:32,454 --> 00:21:35,456
[SPEAKER_00]: This is part, Brooks Estate literally surrounds this, right?

296
00:21:35,496 --> 00:21:40,540
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like we have more political will now than we had.

297
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,322
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even exist when this deal was made.

298
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:47,385
[SPEAKER_00]: We were still a nonprofit that was on the outside looking in.

299
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:52,048
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got 25 years of managing this property and doing things.

300
00:21:52,088 --> 00:21:54,130
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to be at the table for this design.

301
00:21:56,043 --> 00:21:56,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

302
00:21:57,944 --> 00:22:02,886
[SPEAKER_03]: So perhaps we can move just to the, because it's one of the grants.

303
00:22:03,187 --> 00:22:14,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, we have the money from the earmark plus 100,000 or 99 something grant in the last, it's the same, it's the most recent CPA grants.

304
00:22:15,433 --> 00:22:21,476
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we've been told we have those were awarded because they voted on them at the council.

305
00:22:22,036 --> 00:22:22,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I right there?

306
00:22:23,477 --> 00:22:24,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know.

307
00:22:24,557 --> 00:22:25,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm right.

308
00:22:25,158 --> 00:22:25,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

309
00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:25,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm right.

310
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:28,563
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't read about something.

311
00:22:29,163 --> 00:22:49,676
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so the question becomes what that number looks like vis-a-vis the numbers that we just because we're because my understanding is that we're going to we're going to try the stone pack and because we've been very happy with it at the manor and and you know use use that for

312
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,622
[SPEAKER_03]: use that for the parking lot rather than, because I think there'd probably be some serious money saving there.

313
00:22:57,003 --> 00:23:05,306
[SPEAKER_03]: But remember that whole thing had a, but we were going to take 150 from the earmark, which has to be used by 2026 and combined with a CPA.

314
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:10,828
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd have 250 for sort of what we're calling phase one of the parking lot.

315
00:23:10,948 --> 00:23:19,892
[SPEAKER_03]: But my question becomes obviously, and as Carly explained, there's also going to be a bidding process here.

316
00:23:20,646 --> 00:23:21,766
[SPEAKER_03]: for cost estimating.

317
00:23:22,227 --> 00:23:31,430
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, does that grant look like it's blown out of the water because of higher costs from what we just got from Benesh?

318
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,650
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying, well.

319
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:42,933
[SPEAKER_00]: The parking lot as a standalone project and pricing, I'm looking at it, sorry, I'm not sharing the screen, but it was $264,000 and $53,000 of contingency.

320
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:49,313
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 315, 318.

321
00:23:49,853 --> 00:23:53,375
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's asphalt?

322
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:58,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that asphalt, though?

323
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:00,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

324
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:05,679
[SPEAKER_03]: We should not use asphalt unless we absolutely have to.

325
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:12,082
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just wondering if that's what the bid was, and maybe the stone pack might be cheaper.

326
00:24:12,722 --> 00:24:14,343
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is final design.

327
00:24:14,383 --> 00:24:18,184
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see a line item here that says stone pack, so I don't think I've got that yet.

328
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:19,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

329
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:30,946
[SPEAKER_02]: So final design, I think if I was reading that diagram correctly, looked like asphalt to me or bituminous something, I don't know.

330
00:24:31,506 --> 00:24:34,027
[SPEAKER_04]: But maybe that's okay for us because if it's priced at asphalt.

331
00:24:35,048 --> 00:24:37,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, exactly.

332
00:24:37,689 --> 00:24:41,011
[SPEAKER_03]: It's environmentally much preferable to use the stone back.

333
00:24:41,752 --> 00:24:42,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

334
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:47,995
[SPEAKER_03]: If this is a conservation project, it should be consistent with that.

335
00:24:48,345 --> 00:24:52,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, if the stone pack, you know, turns out, everybody uses it.

336
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:54,648
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've been making this argument for a long time.

337
00:24:56,249 --> 00:25:07,554
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if it turns out, you know, this is not a parking lot, you know, next to Home Depot that has 50,000 cars a day on it.

338
00:25:08,274 --> 00:25:11,156
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just not what's designed.

339
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:14,597
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me get more information so we can make an informed decision.

340
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:25,466
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what's interesting about it is if that's an asphalt price and it's $250, is that for the whole thing, including the loop road there?

341
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:27,767
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm just asking.

342
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:31,828
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the loop road is actually in the road number.

343
00:25:31,888 --> 00:25:37,209
[SPEAKER_00]: I confirmed that because I did my own estimate of the length of the road.

344
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,149
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a lot longer.

345
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:45,271
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost 6 tenths of a mile when you add up all the length of the road from Rose Street

346
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:47,895
[SPEAKER_00]: to the loop road around the parking lot.

347
00:25:47,955 --> 00:25:50,415
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be a lot shorter, but it's not anymore.

348
00:25:54,957 --> 00:26:02,599
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get a backed out number for the stone pack, and then we'll be able to decide how far our $250,000 will go.

349
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:07,240
[SPEAKER_03]: We weren't planning in this phase to do the whole parking lot anyway.

350
00:26:08,297 --> 00:26:08,957
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we weren't.

351
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:11,679
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, the stone pack doesn't live in a vacuum, right?

352
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:13,500
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to put the stone pack down.

353
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.

354
00:26:14,381 --> 00:26:17,022
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to actually tear out the tree.

355
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:23,446
[SPEAKER_02]: The main thing is, yeah, we need to get from the manor to the parking lot location.

356
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:29,150
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be my priority, would be grading, tree removal, and setting up the road to the parking lot.

357
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:34,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if we only get a couple of spots, great, 5, 10 spots braided of the parking lot, right?

358
00:26:35,018 --> 00:26:36,139
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really the estimate.

359
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,944
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a piece of the road estimate and a piece of the lot estimate, and then a stone pack instead of whatever other material.

360
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:47,728
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct, and I will pursue that exact.

361
00:26:47,928 --> 00:27:03,801
[SPEAKER_03]: We were smart when we did, I think, when we did the budget for the grant because a chunk of the budget in the grant is for the grading because we had a discussion about you can't grade five feet and it's not efficient to grade 10 feet.

362
00:27:04,627 --> 00:27:20,957
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I'm talking about the basic grading and then we have considerable funds in there for replacing trees and the landscaping, you know, so it's, I mean, I'm an optimist on this because I think it's so critical and, you know, but I think Zach is right.

363
00:27:20,997 --> 00:27:32,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if you get, you got no parking now virtually except for handicapped parking at the manor, if you get ahead, you know, X number of spaces, because the parking lot is not supporting the,

364
00:27:33,132 --> 00:27:36,014
[SPEAKER_03]: carriage house, because the carriage house is in fact, you know.

365
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:36,474
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's right.

366
00:27:36,514 --> 00:27:37,915
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need a fraction of the space.

367
00:27:37,995 --> 00:27:40,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

368
00:27:41,217 --> 00:27:43,759
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, let me just take another pass at these guys.

369
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:45,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay, I've said enough.

370
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,901
[SPEAKER_00]: We can, I think we can move on.

371
00:27:47,061 --> 00:27:50,543
[SPEAKER_00]: We clearly have some flexibility here, you know.

372
00:27:50,823 --> 00:27:51,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

373
00:27:51,363 --> 00:27:52,984
[SPEAKER_00]: With the money we have, we can do something.

374
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:54,025
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it can be meaningful.

375
00:27:55,026 --> 00:27:56,206
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I like to hear.

376
00:27:56,226 --> 00:27:58,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put the administrative,

377
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:03,369
[SPEAKER_03]: funding on here.

378
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:07,950
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know much about what the picture looks like there, because other people have been pursuing it.

379
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:14,491
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe somebody can educate us and see what we think, where we are.

380
00:28:14,511 --> 00:28:18,932
[SPEAKER_02]: You wrote a grant?

381
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:21,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I could share some stuff.

382
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:25,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I think the general picture, and then Doug and Jen certainly have some additional knowledge.

383
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:34,231
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that we're pursuing administrative funding, you know, we've had the conversations with the conversations with the city about what their capacity might be.

384
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:41,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, we're looking at the fund, the city grants to community fund from, I believe, from casino mitigation fund.

385
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:43,996
[SPEAKER_02]: What grants the nonprofit and.

386
00:28:44,956 --> 00:28:48,318
[SPEAKER_02]: that's my my knowledge basis as far as it goes.

387
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:14,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

388
00:29:17,283 --> 00:29:25,004
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was intended to be the admin to support Carly and the whole organization so that she can delegate everything possible to the person and focus on.

389
00:29:25,044 --> 00:29:27,144
[SPEAKER_04]: The PO box and the, yes.

390
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:31,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

391
00:29:31,385 --> 00:29:43,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I think we need to have a formal vote on the date of the, what I'm calling the special annual meeting, or we just called the annual meeting,

392
00:29:43,762 --> 00:29:45,905
[SPEAKER_03]: So that will be on the record.

393
00:29:45,925 --> 00:29:54,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I've circulated the usual language on the notice and the proxy.

394
00:29:54,338 --> 00:29:58,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also said that I would like to, I'd be happy to

395
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:05,764
[SPEAKER_03]: You can reject the offer if you wish, but I'd be happy to handle the USPS part of this.

396
00:30:05,784 --> 00:30:15,933
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also my intention to put some personal notes into some members that I've known for a long time, not that I'm going away, but dropping dead, I don't think.

397
00:30:15,954 --> 00:30:18,356
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to avoid that, yeah.

398
00:30:24,304 --> 00:30:39,060
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioned, we've also used this as an opportunity to get some renewals, which have been slow, mainly because of lack of mailings and that sort of thing.

399
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you can hit on several points with this.

400
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,387
[SPEAKER_03]: The date of June 6th,

401
00:30:47,234 --> 00:30:48,775
[SPEAKER_03]: which is Thursday.

402
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:57,519
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also need to set a time because last year we switched to 6.30, but that's because it was in the dark of winter, et cetera.

403
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:04,883
[SPEAKER_01]: So I- I had already asked Dennis at City Hall to reserve the Zoom for us on the sixth at seven o'clock.

404
00:31:05,543 --> 00:31:07,364
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we'll keep the seven.

405
00:31:07,924 --> 00:31:13,146
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to get a motion to officially establish the date.

406
00:31:16,405 --> 00:31:22,087
[SPEAKER_01]: Motion to have the 2024 annual meeting on June 6th at 7 p.m.

407
00:31:23,308 --> 00:31:23,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a second.

408
00:31:24,968 --> 00:31:25,309
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

409
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:27,329
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

410
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:31,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

411
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:40,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom, I don't know that from an optics standpoint, should the proxies go to somebody else?

412
00:31:42,163 --> 00:31:48,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Or should they be mailed to the PO, to one of us?

413
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,267
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

414
00:31:50,627 --> 00:31:52,248
[SPEAKER_03]: There are two questions there.

415
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:57,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I took out, traditionally, and this language came from our advisors way, way back.

416
00:31:58,131 --> 00:32:03,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I took out the, you know, I name blank or the current president.

417
00:32:04,074 --> 00:32:05,555
[SPEAKER_03]: I took the last part out of it.

418
00:32:05,957 --> 00:32:13,563
[SPEAKER_03]: So the proxies just come back to the organization, they always go to the PO box, or people can send them in, and then we gather them.

419
00:32:14,043 --> 00:32:19,968
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I've said, you know, the annual meeting isn't on top of everybody's social calendar, you know.

420
00:32:20,608 --> 00:32:26,753
[SPEAKER_03]: So the percentage of, you know, you need, at least technically, and it's not like there's

421
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,616
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, some oversight, somebody counting things here.

422
00:32:33,397 --> 00:32:39,220
[SPEAKER_03]: You need the proxies so you're at least confident that you've established a quorum.

423
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:43,301
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are a lot of people that have sent proxies for years.

424
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:45,702
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a habit.

425
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:52,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe it's the same habit as sending a check for renewal, but you know, habits are not bad ideas and those sorts of things.

426
00:32:52,745 --> 00:32:55,066
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think there's, I think it's just as official

427
00:32:56,123 --> 00:33:08,830
[SPEAKER_03]: always would be the only difference is that, you know, in the in the future, you have a different have a different president, you can put their name on it or not, you know, and and, you know, so that I think that.

428
00:33:10,691 --> 00:33:15,413
[SPEAKER_03]: So June 6, that is the 80th anniversary of D-Day, somehow symbolic.

429
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:16,433
[SPEAKER_03]: The

430
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,298
[SPEAKER_03]: That sort of thing.

431
00:33:19,438 --> 00:33:27,461
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tom, there's no, like, there's no, like, operating manual for M-Belts.

432
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:36,063
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have the articles or the nonprofit thing, but there's no, like, this is everything we need to do every year.

433
00:33:37,323 --> 00:33:38,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Document anything written down.

434
00:33:41,145 --> 00:33:41,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's...

435
00:33:44,002 --> 00:33:44,802
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all written down.

436
00:33:44,862 --> 00:33:47,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not all written in one place.

437
00:33:47,943 --> 00:34:02,367
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, and you can tell me, but the memo I send about what the president does is, and I know that's gonna change, obviously, but it kind of encapsulates that.

438
00:34:02,827 --> 00:34:12,110
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want, and I'd be happy to do this, if you want, I'm not gonna do something elaborate, frankly, but if you want at least a check, maybe we call it a checklist,

439
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:14,434
[SPEAKER_03]: things that have to be done every year.

440
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:29,108
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be super helpful because I'm saving the emails that you're sending about the filings and this and I'm like, we need to make sure that that knowledge gets written down.

441
00:34:29,128 --> 00:34:31,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

442
00:34:32,751 --> 00:34:33,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I will do that.

443
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:35,694
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing I would say to people is that,

444
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:47,776
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm probably the wrong person to ask about this, because it's kind of like falling out of bed for me, you know, this this kind of stuff is, is that it's, it's, you know, it's the kind of thing you do it once.

445
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:50,558
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it shouldn't be a problem.

446
00:34:50,738 --> 00:34:55,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, like, just make an example of the Attorney General's PC annual annual filing.

447
00:34:56,462 --> 00:35:04,708
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're not like the IRS, where if you if you miss it by a week, you know, all of a sudden you owe them five grand, you know, I'm being funny, but

448
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,925
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, a kind of thing.

449
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:12,068
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'll give an example, the corporate, you know, we're, we're a corporation.

450
00:35:12,108 --> 00:35:19,493
[SPEAKER_03]: So we also have to send, you know, the annual registration of $35 or whatever it is to them.

451
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:29,239
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, since a lot of things have changed since COVID, since COVID, they don't, they don't harass you for that, you know, you're supposed to do it.

452
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:30,300
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, if you're a little,

453
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:34,404
[SPEAKER_03]: you're three months late, they're not going to take away your corporate corpus.

454
00:35:34,504 --> 00:35:40,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying you're deliberately, you know, shilly-shally around, but that kind of thing.

455
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:42,947
[SPEAKER_01]: So because we're a nonprofit, we only have to pay $35?

456
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:46,469
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it depends on your receipts.

457
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:48,510
[SPEAKER_03]: $35 is the minimum.

458
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:57,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Two things, the attorney general thing is if you're under, I'm sorry, I don't remember the number off the top of my head, if you're under $50,000, it's $35.

459
00:35:57,373 --> 00:35:58,714
[SPEAKER_03]: In those years where we've gotten,

460
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Considerable more money.

461
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:02,573
[SPEAKER_03]: We paid like 70 dollars.

462
00:36:03,174 --> 00:36:04,174
[SPEAKER_03]: You know there's a cap there.

463
00:36:04,194 --> 00:36:05,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't go to five million dollars.

464
00:36:05,795 --> 00:36:06,695
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's it's.

465
00:36:07,256 --> 00:36:09,317
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing the other thing has changed about that.

466
00:36:09,637 --> 00:36:11,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And frankly I think it's a little clunky is that is it.

467
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:14,059
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't do it by paper anymore.

468
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:15,279
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do it online.

469
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:15,940
[SPEAKER_03]: So

470
00:36:16,685 --> 00:36:20,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, like I have to do my LLC filing every year online.

471
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:24,571
[SPEAKER_01]: But I have to pay $500 a year.

472
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:26,892
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't pay $500 a year.

473
00:36:26,932 --> 00:36:27,693
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no.

474
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:32,036
[SPEAKER_03]: We pay much cheaper than that, yeah.

475
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:34,498
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because they're making so much money on the LLCs.

476
00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:39,801
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an LLC once years ago with a partner in New Jersey.

477
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:44,344
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was remarkable how much New Jersey extracted every year from it.

478
00:36:44,364 --> 00:36:44,925
[SPEAKER_03]: So Tom.

479
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

480
00:36:46,311 --> 00:36:48,052
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned that you're going to get that stuff together.

481
00:36:48,112 --> 00:36:49,793
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you and I do that together as kind of.

482
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:51,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be delighted to do that.

483
00:36:51,975 --> 00:36:52,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

484
00:36:52,355 --> 00:36:55,617
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I can kind of create it in some sort of format.

485
00:36:56,078 --> 00:37:01,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Jen was so proactive today and sent me some examples of what other nonprofits use.

486
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,704
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Jen, for giving us some examples of that.

487
00:37:04,784 --> 00:37:08,206
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'll just kind of plug in the knowledge where we can and I'll lean on the board for filling in the gaps.

488
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:14,431
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do want to mention just just as we're being recorded for the record that that we have

489
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:25,120
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now clear, I sent this around, we're now clear with the IRS in terms of that snafu, which is a huge relief to me, frankly.

490
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:31,444
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad, Tom, you're off the FBI's top 10 most wanted list.

491
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:32,285
[SPEAKER_03]: At least for that.

492
00:37:32,945 --> 00:37:38,930
[SPEAKER_03]: So I put on here, and really, you guys should drive it at this point, other

493
00:37:40,282 --> 00:37:47,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that what we just did falls under transition issues in terms of the checklist.

494
00:37:49,077 --> 00:37:49,958
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's what I would say.

495
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I would just throw this out.

496
00:37:54,324 --> 00:38:02,186
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've got to meet with Jen next week about some of the technicalities of the Google registration.

497
00:38:03,526 --> 00:38:06,687
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some things that I don't think have to be done immediately.

498
00:38:06,707 --> 00:38:14,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, one thing I never mentioned, I have a phone line with the Brooks Estate number, which is sitting three feet from me here.

499
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:19,110
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you want to do with that.

500
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,345
[SPEAKER_03]: The phone line is a real, well, I don't know, it's a kind of a headache.

501
00:38:29,046 --> 00:38:30,066
[SPEAKER_04]: How often does it ring?

502
00:38:32,008 --> 00:38:35,751
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not very often, and you get all kinds of junk calls.

503
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:48,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Like all organizations, we have tried, and Jen's going to laugh when she hears this, but we have tried to push people towards

504
00:38:49,412 --> 00:38:57,815
[SPEAKER_03]: towards the website and towards the email.

505
00:38:58,175 --> 00:39:04,677
[SPEAKER_03]: One mostly gets our strange calls about, I don't know, movie sets and things.

506
00:39:04,757 --> 00:39:12,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So people, and then you make an arrangement, and then they call back and say, you're not really what we're thinking about, that kind of thing.

507
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,400
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, and it costs us $26 a month or something.

508
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:19,441
[SPEAKER_03]: That sort of thing.

509
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:30,670
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to leave this agenda item open for other things that you want from me, or you think are transition issues.

510
00:39:30,750 --> 00:39:32,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think we have to decide everything right now, but.

511
00:39:33,573 --> 00:39:33,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So go ahead.

512
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:37,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom, you mentioned at some point there's a thumb drive that you made.

513
00:39:37,316 --> 00:39:38,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I will give you that.

514
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:38,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

515
00:39:38,858 --> 00:39:39,218
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

516
00:39:39,658 --> 00:39:39,758
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

517
00:39:39,798 --> 00:39:40,819
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been slow on that.

518
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:42,040
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's fine.

519
00:39:42,661 --> 00:39:43,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I actually.

520
00:39:45,438 --> 00:39:49,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Carly, I'm going to take it, and then you and I will get together.

521
00:39:50,161 --> 00:39:50,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds good.

522
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:51,182
[SPEAKER_01]: And Tom?

523
00:39:51,242 --> 00:39:53,684
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be amazed how much is on it.

524
00:39:54,164 --> 00:39:54,884
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.

525
00:39:55,065 --> 00:39:58,807
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a treasure trove of information.

526
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:07,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom, I think it might be helpful if you and I, just over the next little while after things become official, just set up a time regularly to meet just so we can keep it.

527
00:40:07,493 --> 00:40:08,693
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure, sure, sure, sure.

528
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:11,575
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll connect with you offline about that, but I think it'd be nice to go.

529
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:14,197
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll bring my toy truck collection for Sam.

530
00:40:14,397 --> 00:40:18,078
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch out, he might get you involved in the kitchen remodel.

531
00:40:19,278 --> 00:40:23,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know anything about marmolium floors?

532
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,240
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually do, of course not.

533
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Better than I look, actually.

534
00:40:31,322 --> 00:40:36,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Another item that's not on the agenda, but I think we can be flexible here, is the caretakers.

535
00:40:36,683 --> 00:40:37,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I right?

536
00:40:40,244 --> 00:40:40,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

537
00:40:40,624 --> 00:40:42,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's the summary of the caretaker situation.

538
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,772
[SPEAKER_03]: please correct me if I'm incorrect.

539
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:47,574
[SPEAKER_03]: We have two caretakers.

540
00:40:48,755 --> 00:40:50,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Carly's met at least one of them.

541
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:54,581
[SPEAKER_03]: You maybe met both, I don't know, I wasn't there.

542
00:40:54,601 --> 00:40:55,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheryl and Steven.

543
00:41:01,174 --> 00:41:02,696
[SPEAKER_03]: We've had them for six years.

544
00:41:03,656 --> 00:41:13,405
[SPEAKER_03]: They are operating on a sort of automatically extended agreement that was drafted by yours truly and Mark Rumley, who was then the city solicitor when we had a city solicitor.

545
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:20,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheryl is leaving, is moving out by July 1st.

546
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,592
[SPEAKER_03]: She has secured a job that includes housing.

547
00:41:22,672 --> 00:41:24,314
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what the situation is.

548
00:41:24,334 --> 00:41:26,455
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really kind of none of our business, I suppose.

549
00:41:26,756 --> 00:41:27,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.

550
00:41:27,997 --> 00:41:28,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

551
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:51,247
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, this needs, is gonna need some attention in terms of, we have always felt, and I think we're right here, that having a couple of people there is essential in terms of coverage, you know, in terms of security, that sort of thing.

552
00:41:52,368 --> 00:41:59,770
[SPEAKER_03]: The caretakers are also, have always been, and particularly in the last four, five, six years, have always been, you know,

553
00:42:00,378 --> 00:42:06,039
[SPEAKER_03]: ambassadors, if that's the right word, for our cause.

554
00:42:06,379 --> 00:42:10,840
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are two pieces to this, and I'm hoping to be involved as little as possible in it.

555
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:20,521
[SPEAKER_03]: One is the nature of the agreement and the financial side, and I know there's been some discussion about that.

556
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:29,043
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other is, you know, the process for a transition there, and I'll just leave it at that.

557
00:42:31,053 --> 00:42:47,271
[SPEAKER_03]: The only other thing I would say is that this is somewhat complicated in terms of some of the history and sort of the general situation.

558
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:49,053
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if somebody else wants to

559
00:42:50,064 --> 00:42:50,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I can jump in here.

560
00:42:50,824 --> 00:42:57,387
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes me very sad because Cheryl has been the greatest ambassador as far as I can take her.

561
00:42:58,047 --> 00:42:58,527
[SPEAKER_00]: She has.

562
00:42:59,187 --> 00:42:59,727
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been great.

563
00:43:00,007 --> 00:43:04,529
[SPEAKER_00]: And Stephen, they appear to be splitting as a couple for whatever.

564
00:43:04,649 --> 00:43:05,869
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, again, none of our business.

565
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:12,852
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that Stephen can't do the job, and he's not a great ambassador either.

566
00:43:13,492 --> 00:43:16,053
[SPEAKER_00]: But Cheryl's the one who does 99% of the work.

567
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:21,170
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a chance for us.

568
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,771
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really living there rent free.

569
00:43:22,791 --> 00:43:30,817
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying utilities which is about five grand a year and you're providing maintenance around the manor and doing all these things to keep the building running obviously.

570
00:43:32,078 --> 00:43:40,005
[SPEAKER_00]: But we think it's an opportunity now with the work from home and a new opportunity to actually raise a little bit of funds but still not have a tenancy.

571
00:43:41,258 --> 00:43:43,340
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a way to do that, we think, legally to do that.

572
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:46,022
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a few more dollars out of it.

573
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:50,686
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think possibly more than two people could live there.

574
00:43:52,508 --> 00:43:56,791
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a nice situation where they'd have probably half of market rate rent.

575
00:43:58,072 --> 00:44:06,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, picking them for people who could be ambassadors, who might have some skill sets that we could use as an organization.

576
00:44:07,828 --> 00:44:10,870
[SPEAKER_00]: With events or event planning, that may be part of the job.

577
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:17,153
[SPEAKER_00]: We can redefine their job, I think, a little bit to get a little bit more both financially and participation.

578
00:44:17,173 --> 00:44:24,297
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to let Stephen live there probably to the end of the year, but we will start.

579
00:44:24,477 --> 00:44:32,661
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take a few months to figure out what we want to do, advertise, interview us, plus the city would be there as well.

580
00:44:32,681 --> 00:44:37,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the guy in the building department participated last time,

581
00:44:38,086 --> 00:44:44,015
[SPEAKER_00]: and will again, it was Moki then, it would be the new one now, and have somebody in place by the end of the year.

582
00:44:44,035 --> 00:44:47,339
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what we're thinking as the broad outline.

583
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,862
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Jen.

584
00:44:51,798 --> 00:44:56,682
[SPEAKER_01]: My well, my we, you know, my thought was that we might be able to spend this as an affordable.

585
00:44:57,523 --> 00:45:02,868
[SPEAKER_01]: Not officially affordable, but a affordable housing opportunity for somebody.

586
00:45:04,289 --> 00:45:10,715
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we have to be, you know, we have to kind of be careful with the language that we choose, but, um.

587
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:19,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that there's a huge opportunity here and I think Doug shared with me the caretaker's agreements.

588
00:45:20,025 --> 00:45:37,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I took a look at it and I think that maybe having two couples or three people or something where it allows them to take a vacation and there's a backup person and just having redundancies there might help us

589
00:45:37,975 --> 00:45:47,784
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and then like, say, two people want to leave and one person stays and then, I don't know, there just might be opportunities there to rotate people in and out.

590
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,427
[SPEAKER_04]: What does the living space look like inside there?

591
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:52,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we should go look at it.

592
00:45:52,189 --> 00:45:53,290
[SPEAKER_01]: Whoa, she needs to have a tour.

593
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:54,311
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been in there for a while.

594
00:45:54,611 --> 00:45:58,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I definitely have been in the kitchen area, but as far as I'm thinking about the bedroom.

595
00:45:58,792 --> 00:46:00,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you like the kitchen because we did it ourselves.

596
00:46:01,112 --> 00:46:02,372
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't.

597
00:46:03,353 --> 00:46:05,353
[SPEAKER_03]: I did the floor with my nephew.

598
00:46:05,433 --> 00:46:06,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard of that.

599
00:46:06,313 --> 00:46:08,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I did most of the work.

600
00:46:08,934 --> 00:46:10,334
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three rooms upstairs.

601
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:14,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, it's the room above the dining room.

602
00:46:14,975 --> 00:46:15,695
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one of the rooms.

603
00:46:16,215 --> 00:46:22,936
[SPEAKER_00]: The room above the kitchen, which is quite large because it's got windows on three sides and it's bigger than the kitchen because it includes all those storage rooms and the bathroom.

604
00:46:23,578 --> 00:46:23,818
[SPEAKER_00]: above.

605
00:46:23,858 --> 00:46:28,059
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of their bedroom, but it could be a living room depending on their arrangement.

606
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:34,440
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's a room above the office on the front of the house, which is also, so it's kind of three rooms connected in the bathroom.

607
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,581
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a possibility.

608
00:46:36,621 --> 00:46:38,661
[SPEAKER_00]: I can send a floor plan around that would explain that.

609
00:46:38,721 --> 00:46:43,122
[SPEAKER_00]: We obviously would should go look at it as a group and figure things out.

610
00:46:46,362 --> 00:46:49,323
[SPEAKER_00]: As Tom mentioned, he and Rumway, the solicitor back in the day,

611
00:46:50,018 --> 00:46:51,199
[SPEAKER_00]: put together the agreement.

612
00:46:51,779 --> 00:46:59,682
[SPEAKER_00]: It grew out of unfortunately a rather difficult situation where the previous caretakers who were both in their 40s.

613
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:04,645
[SPEAKER_00]: The woman became pregnant and we had a real legal situation on our hand with lead paint.

614
00:47:05,205 --> 00:47:06,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about this.

615
00:47:06,305 --> 00:47:07,586
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah that's a disaster.

616
00:47:07,706 --> 00:47:09,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Messy messy again.

617
00:47:09,107 --> 00:47:13,909
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was really difficult things to walk a fine line because you can't

618
00:47:14,866 --> 00:47:16,406
[SPEAKER_00]: Discriminate, of course.

619
00:47:17,047 --> 00:47:19,227
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to work from home.

620
00:47:19,307 --> 00:47:21,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, there's a work from home potential that didn't exist six years ago.

621
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:27,969
[SPEAKER_00]: So the coverage could actually be a lot easier than it was then, because no one worked from home six years ago.

622
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:33,591
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, 25% of the United States does on a daily basis.

623
00:47:36,051 --> 00:47:39,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to make a couple other obvious points, just in terms of background.

624
00:47:39,882 --> 00:47:51,324
[SPEAKER_03]: One is that, and I think, Doug, you know, when we first got caretakers in there, the mansion, the manor isn't perfect, but it's a heck of a lot, more than a heck of a lot better place to live than it was.

625
00:47:51,545 --> 00:47:52,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Not unsafe now.

626
00:47:52,865 --> 00:47:53,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

627
00:47:53,785 --> 00:47:54,345
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

628
00:47:54,625 --> 00:47:55,465
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

629
00:47:55,625 --> 00:48:05,808
[SPEAKER_03]: In that, well, the other thing that's changed the course is the overall housing market, but the manor is still, you know, it's still,

630
00:48:08,516 --> 00:48:11,598
[SPEAKER_03]: what it is in terms of conditions.

631
00:48:12,218 --> 00:48:31,811
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing that to think about here, obviously, is that, you know, just before we got this news, we were actively working on a test basis to start using, you know, having donation-based rentals, so to speak, of rooms for meetings.

632
00:48:32,131 --> 00:48:33,852
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk with the arts groups and things.

633
00:48:34,393 --> 00:48:34,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And you need

634
00:48:35,841 --> 00:48:40,785
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's another reason you need at least two people there is you need somebody there that can open and close.

635
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:47,110
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's a little vague, because we hadn't even thought about that in the current agreement.

636
00:48:47,550 --> 00:48:48,611
[SPEAKER_03]: And that has to be thought out.

637
00:48:49,251 --> 00:48:57,378
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, the other obvious big picture, which I think I talked to Carly about is that, you know, at some point,

638
00:48:58,770 --> 00:49:02,053
[SPEAKER_03]: once Doug finds the three and a half million dollars for the road, etc.

639
00:49:02,573 --> 00:49:03,214
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just joking.

640
00:49:04,795 --> 00:49:15,263
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point, you know, you're going to need some active management for the function.

641
00:49:15,343 --> 00:49:17,285
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't mean somebody has to be on site, but

642
00:49:18,846 --> 00:49:21,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of those places have somebody on site.

643
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:27,770
[SPEAKER_03]: They may not be full-time manager, et cetera, but you know, it's a real, make a cliche, it's a real hands-on job.

644
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:45,299
[SPEAKER_03]: So lots to think about in terms of, and it's also a very, you know, we've been very careful and I think done a very good job, because we've had four or five caretakers in there over the last quarter century, in terms of making this a very above board process.

645
00:49:45,973 --> 00:49:59,060
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's, it's, it's, it's a scarce good, you know, it's, it's, and it's also, it's, it's also, it's the perfect thing for some people and absolutely the wrong thing for others.

646
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:07,804
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and, and sorting those two things out in the interview process and the application process is really, is really critical.

647
00:50:08,225 --> 00:50:12,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I can recall, we had people, you don't mention any names, et cetera, but

648
00:50:13,288 --> 00:50:16,911
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, people that said, I'd like to move there with my 93-year-old mother.

649
00:50:18,912 --> 00:50:23,035
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, from, you know, four states away.

650
00:50:24,156 --> 00:50:25,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Change the name to the Bates Motel.

651
00:50:25,737 --> 00:50:28,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I ask a question?

652
00:50:29,399 --> 00:50:38,185
[SPEAKER_06]: So more immediately, has Steve been spoken with by anybody and has he agreed to stay till the end of the year?

653
00:50:38,205 --> 00:50:41,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that might, we're assuming, are we assuming he'll stay?

654
00:50:42,048 --> 00:50:47,430
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to Cheryl, not Steve, directly about this, and he doesn't want to leave.

655
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:49,091
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he's comfortable there.

656
00:50:50,812 --> 00:50:53,072
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we'll get there.

657
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:57,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we figure things out, we want to give him a lot of time.

658
00:50:57,314 --> 00:50:59,135
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to show him the door.

659
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:04,457
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been a good guy all along, even though he hasn't done most of the work.

660
00:51:04,897 --> 00:51:05,877
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not been a negative.

661
00:51:05,957 --> 00:51:09,159
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just want to give him plenty of time.

662
00:51:10,173 --> 00:51:16,136
[SPEAKER_00]: we really need to have a different structure and a different group in place, because he just can't do that.

663
00:51:16,576 --> 00:51:20,178
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, could he maybe be the third person if we go that route?

664
00:51:20,658 --> 00:51:27,241
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't think that group needs to come together as a group, whether it's two or three or whatever it is.

665
00:51:27,581 --> 00:51:29,522
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to force roommates on people.

666
00:51:29,622 --> 00:51:30,282
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a disaster.

667
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:30,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

668
00:51:34,446 --> 00:51:45,430
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we need the flexibility, we need to work from home, we need coverage, we need people who have the skills to do it, and both the people skills, in some ways the facilities management skills to work on the building.

669
00:51:46,151 --> 00:51:46,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

670
00:51:47,551 --> 00:51:56,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Has there been any discussion, and I know these things are kind of disjointed time-wise, but has there been any discussion around combining the caretaker search and the administrator search?

671
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:00,042
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not yet.

672
00:52:00,102 --> 00:52:03,143
[SPEAKER_00]: The administrator was on a track starting in January.

673
00:52:03,183 --> 00:52:06,264
[SPEAKER_00]: The caretaker week is about 30 days ago or so.

674
00:52:06,385 --> 00:52:13,728
[SPEAKER_00]: So they could be combined, but I do see them as having, I'd be surprised if we could find the same group.

675
00:52:13,808 --> 00:52:15,288
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be definitely a unicorn.

676
00:52:15,308 --> 00:52:16,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Caretaker, that would be great.

677
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:21,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, that would be nice if we could kind of combine some responsibilities and add some funding for them.

678
00:52:21,591 --> 00:52:23,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

679
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:34,847
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, here's the thing, the reality of the caretaker thing is, is that it's a pretty, it's a pretty long list of responsibilities.

680
00:52:35,307 --> 00:52:43,030
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not necessarily, you know, you have to be doing it 24 seven, but you know, there's an on call basis.

681
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:49,892
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been very, very useful for opening and closing when we have onsite projects.

682
00:52:50,492 --> 00:52:58,396
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so that yours truly, et cetera, wouldn't have to go up there every morning at seven o'clock, that kind of thing.

683
00:52:58,696 --> 00:53:05,800
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing, you know, the number of people that walk by there has certainly increased in the last while.

684
00:53:06,721 --> 00:53:14,745
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ambassador and the visibility side of it, you know, you can probably spend a whole three more hours talking about this.

685
00:53:15,005 --> 00:53:17,306
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing, and I said this,

686
00:53:19,473 --> 00:53:23,354
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier, I think is that, you know, we've been strict.

687
00:53:23,614 --> 00:53:26,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've been right about the number of vehicles there.

688
00:53:26,695 --> 00:53:35,858
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you don't want a situation where you have a manor with five cars parked in front of it every day, you know, in terms of that sort of thing.

689
00:53:35,918 --> 00:53:44,581
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's, you know, there's clearly, as Doug and other people have mentioned, and Jen, there's clearly a real balancing act here.

690
00:53:44,601 --> 00:53:44,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So,

691
00:53:49,783 --> 00:53:51,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, to be determined, as they say.

692
00:53:53,525 --> 00:54:00,370
[SPEAKER_03]: So picnic coming up in less than two months.

693
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:08,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I saw, I didn't open it, but I think I saw a document floating around about planning, or am I fantasizing about it?

694
00:54:09,857 --> 00:54:10,997
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.

695
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:17,502
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I circulated something that had the usual list of tasks, and I know it's,

696
00:54:19,398 --> 00:54:24,562
[SPEAKER_00]: I popped it in the Google Drive, Carly and Jen, but I don't know, did I send it to everyone or not?

697
00:54:26,383 --> 00:54:28,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Was this in preparation for the spring cleanup?

698
00:54:28,664 --> 00:54:29,465
[SPEAKER_04]: For the picnic.

699
00:54:29,685 --> 00:54:30,105
[SPEAKER_00]: The picnic.

700
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so this is separate.

701
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:31,526
[SPEAKER_04]: In July.

702
00:54:31,546 --> 00:54:31,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

703
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:35,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just wasn't sure if the tasks were kind of like...

704
00:54:35,758 --> 00:54:40,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there were some like clean the tables and chairs, but we've got some more stuff.

705
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:50,841
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have another, well, we obviously have the annual meeting, we'll talk about it, but we actually have a board meeting in June too, right on the 20th, I think, is that correct?

706
00:54:51,281 --> 00:54:51,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're right.

707
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:52,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

708
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:57,602
[SPEAKER_00]: That was meant to be the actual detailed planning, but really finalized planning.

709
00:54:57,622 --> 00:55:02,944
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should circulate that document in the Google Drive to everyone, refine it a little bit.

710
00:55:02,984 --> 00:55:04,944
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely some things on there about,

711
00:55:05,796 --> 00:55:12,538
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, who's bringing what, who's doing what for the, for the, uh, for the raffle and all that stuff.

712
00:55:12,658 --> 00:55:21,099
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's some fairly well played things we've done for many years that we can just revive, I think pretty quickly with that list.

713
00:55:21,139 --> 00:55:25,660
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say is, is, is that it hasn't been huge money, but it's been steady money.

714
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:30,962
[SPEAKER_03]: We've most years we make a profit of, you know, two, three, $4,000 on, on the picnic.

715
00:55:34,761 --> 00:55:35,941
[SPEAKER_03]: We've done sponsorships.

716
00:55:36,001 --> 00:55:44,886
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're gonna solicit those, you need to do it before June 20th, I would say, and that kind of thing.

717
00:55:45,386 --> 00:56:01,934
[SPEAKER_03]: The other issue is, and I'm sorry to bring this up, but the other issue is that, and I'm sure you saw it when you were up there for the spring spruce supper, is the mountain of logs sitting across there and the down telephone wire, which you absolutely can't have,

718
00:56:04,325 --> 00:56:06,745
[SPEAKER_03]: for many reasons at the picnic.

719
00:56:06,765 --> 00:56:08,266
[SPEAKER_03]: So something that needs to be addressed.

720
00:56:08,286 --> 00:56:15,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think Zach, you were gonna talk to someone in the city hall about the tree.

721
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:19,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I haven't done it.

722
00:56:19,248 --> 00:56:19,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to do it.

723
00:56:22,528 --> 00:56:23,129
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

724
00:56:23,689 --> 00:56:30,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, this is a sidebar, but there's also a tree down across the wall that I saw today when I- It must be new.

725
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:36,033
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sticking out, but it's definitely down.

726
00:56:36,093 --> 00:56:43,337
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably in the Terrier Road area.

727
00:56:43,498 --> 00:56:45,299
[SPEAKER_03]: On the northern, okay.

728
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,000
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

729
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:52,583
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can see it, it's definitely sticking out a little bit, but it's a tree that's down.

730
00:56:52,603 --> 00:56:55,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.

731
00:56:57,947 --> 00:56:59,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we've always had,

732
00:57:02,675 --> 00:57:08,760
[SPEAKER_03]: two people that we've known for years to handle the grills, which is something that's not easy to do.

733
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:13,784
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know the, yeah, it is a big job.

734
00:57:13,824 --> 00:57:17,087
[SPEAKER_03]: And I happen to know one lives on my street.

735
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:20,970
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure what the situation is there.

736
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,792
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think you need to think about that.

737
00:57:24,332 --> 00:57:26,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that true for both of them?

738
00:57:26,134 --> 00:57:28,376
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that John Bull was struggling a little bit.

739
00:57:28,476 --> 00:57:30,277
[SPEAKER_00]: Is Scott MIA these days?

740
00:57:32,499 --> 00:57:32,860
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

741
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,802
[SPEAKER_03]: Scott is somewhat of a mystery.

742
00:57:35,822 --> 00:57:41,527
[SPEAKER_03]: And the two of them come as a unit.

743
00:57:44,269 --> 00:57:49,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have not talked to John Bull, but I don't think he's well.

744
00:57:49,713 --> 00:57:51,515
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like saying that.

745
00:57:53,256 --> 00:57:55,238
[SPEAKER_03]: And because Scott's been concerned about that.

746
00:57:55,918 --> 00:58:00,142
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's always a, oh, there we go.

747
00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:06,853
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the shopping list that's on the Google Drive that Carly, I think, created.

748
00:58:07,634 --> 00:58:10,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Just listing, you know, supplies.

749
00:58:11,077 --> 00:58:17,002
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked Cheryl to take a look on supplies, the setup, who's doing what, raffle prizes, which I think

750
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:19,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger, you used to do that mostly, I think.

751
00:58:20,049 --> 00:58:25,070
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, people would just send me the list of raffle prizes so I could get it on time.

752
00:58:25,130 --> 00:58:27,930
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that might be an extra step.

753
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:32,872
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe we can just send them to whoever's going to consolidate the list.

754
00:58:34,032 --> 00:58:38,133
[SPEAKER_03]: I will contribute money, but I'm not going to do anything else.

755
00:58:38,193 --> 00:58:42,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we convince Cheryl to help us at this, even though she'll be moved out?

756
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:45,812
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think she's going to be there physically.

757
00:58:45,892 --> 00:58:48,253
[SPEAKER_00]: I can ask, but I don't think we can count on that.

758
00:58:48,534 --> 00:58:49,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Is she moving out of state?

759
00:58:51,115 --> 00:58:51,315
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

760
00:58:51,856 --> 00:58:52,076
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

761
00:58:52,336 --> 00:58:52,857
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

762
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:55,939
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where, but it's definitely not out of state.

763
00:58:56,439 --> 00:58:57,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, man.

764
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:00,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the company that she's worked part-time for.

765
00:59:00,141 --> 00:59:01,122
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a big real estate.

766
00:59:01,883 --> 00:59:09,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she said to us that she's got a job probably managing a big apartment complex, I think.

767
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:12,911
[SPEAKER_03]: He's had a tremendous amount of experience doing that.

768
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:24,254
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, you know, on that thumb drive is, you know, every year there's a folder for each year's picnic, you know, so.

769
00:59:25,314 --> 00:59:32,196
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, you know, and I'm happy to kick in some, certainly some cash for sponsorship.

770
00:59:32,856 --> 00:59:35,897
[SPEAKER_03]: And Doug will pay for the, Doug always provides the,

771
00:59:37,127 --> 00:59:39,048
[SPEAKER_03]: very, very gourmet hot dogs.

772
00:59:40,249 --> 00:59:42,251
[SPEAKER_04]: Doug told me he's getting a sash for you this year too.

773
00:59:42,891 --> 00:59:45,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what?

774
00:59:47,314 --> 00:59:47,794
[SPEAKER_04]: Something.

775
00:59:48,355 --> 00:59:50,116
[SPEAKER_04]: So how would we get in touch with Scott?

776
00:59:50,136 --> 00:59:52,177
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that... Yeah, that's a good question.

777
00:59:54,278 --> 00:59:55,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll ask him about it.

778
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:58,241
[SPEAKER_00]: He takes my calls once a year.

779
00:59:58,741 --> 01:00:00,803
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a charcoal grill that we use?

780
01:00:02,404 --> 01:00:02,744
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

781
01:00:05,395 --> 01:00:06,536
[SPEAKER_00]: We use two grills.

782
01:00:06,556 --> 01:00:09,096
[SPEAKER_03]: We use a charcoal grill and we have a gas grill.

783
01:00:09,637 --> 01:00:11,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's always been propane.

784
01:00:11,918 --> 01:00:14,999
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't keep it in the house, but it's been in the carriage house.

785
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,060
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't care if that blows up.

786
01:00:20,341 --> 01:00:21,981
[SPEAKER_03]: It already blew up.

787
01:00:22,021 --> 01:00:23,622
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather have it there than sitting outdoors someplace.

788
01:00:23,942 --> 01:00:24,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.

789
01:00:36,212 --> 01:00:39,233
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's the picnic, you know, sooner rather than later.

790
01:00:39,253 --> 01:00:41,014
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start working on that.

791
01:00:41,314 --> 01:00:43,015
[SPEAKER_04]: What's our general attendance on the picnic?

792
01:00:44,055 --> 01:00:45,196
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it varies.

793
01:00:45,456 --> 01:00:46,717
[SPEAKER_03]: And people can help me out here.

794
01:00:46,737 --> 01:00:50,318
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's probably the max.

795
01:00:50,818 --> 01:00:59,422
[SPEAKER_03]: There's sort of there's a bit of a physical, you know, we don't let people drive up to the park at the manor unless they have handicap parking.

796
01:00:59,442 --> 01:00:59,502
[SPEAKER_03]: And

797
01:01:03,413 --> 01:01:09,500
[SPEAKER_03]: Most years, Doug or somebody else has provided a little shuttle up and down the road with his electric car.

798
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:16,187
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, it's probably been from about 90 to 150 people someplace in there.

799
01:01:16,207 --> 01:01:19,271
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had a lot of new people in the last few years.

800
01:01:19,351 --> 01:01:20,672
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been very noticeable.

801
01:01:20,772 --> 01:01:21,953
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's a fabulous thing.

802
01:01:25,861 --> 01:01:30,734
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of people who attend and just fill the place and they have, you know, we give two or three tours.

803
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,699
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually quite amazing to see that.

804
01:01:34,194 --> 01:01:34,814
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really fun.

805
01:01:34,834 --> 01:01:39,035
[SPEAKER_00]: And Carly, now that you have quartered the market in South Medford.

806
01:01:39,055 --> 01:01:39,675
[SPEAKER_04]: South Medford.

807
01:01:40,176 --> 01:01:41,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Who wants your posse there?

808
01:01:42,196 --> 01:01:46,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Bring your whole posse down there, get a little shuttle bus going, and we'll work it out.

809
01:01:47,017 --> 01:01:48,218
[SPEAKER_04]: I've already invited some people.

810
01:01:48,238 --> 01:01:49,078
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, save the date.

811
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:50,038
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to happen.

812
01:01:50,058 --> 01:01:51,799
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll send you more information later.

813
01:01:51,919 --> 01:01:53,499
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to fill it out this year.

814
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:57,000
[SPEAKER_03]: The other good thing about the picnic is you don't have to go for three hours.

815
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,781
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people say, I'm just going to come for an hour, and then you see they're still there.

816
01:02:01,201 --> 01:02:03,522
[SPEAKER_03]: But the last thing is, if it's really, really hot,

817
01:02:04,332 --> 01:02:12,014
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, walking up the road for some people is, you know, you can understand that is a schlep.

818
01:02:12,214 --> 01:02:25,376
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we've been, we're very careful about cars on the road and in that area, et cetera, because the last thing you need is something to happen.

819
01:02:28,217 --> 01:02:32,838
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, and then I'll shut up about this, but I think that having a few more,

820
01:02:33,758 --> 01:02:42,826
[SPEAKER_03]: younger folk on the setup and the physical side, you know, because when the picnic's over, everybody's wasted, not wasted, wasted.

821
01:02:42,966 --> 01:02:44,147
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of picnic is this?

822
01:02:44,328 --> 01:02:45,289
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, it isn't.

823
01:02:45,329 --> 01:02:46,069
[SPEAKER_03]: No alcohol.

824
01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:49,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Petty property, no alcohol.

825
01:02:50,914 --> 01:02:55,358
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, but it's, you know, there's a lot, setting up is a lot of work.

826
01:02:55,378 --> 01:02:57,900
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got it down to a science, but it's still,

827
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:04,856
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've got the chair, you know, years ago, we used to have to drag the chair from somebody's church or something.

828
01:03:05,917 --> 01:03:12,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let me help with that piece, then I'm going to nominate myself to be in charge of the physical labor aspect in the setup and take down.

829
01:03:12,544 --> 01:03:13,204
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, great.

830
01:03:13,765 --> 01:03:15,907
[SPEAKER_04]: As my dad would call him, strong backs, weak minds.

831
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:18,509
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all we need.

832
01:03:18,529 --> 01:03:21,072
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is a dangerous expression in the history of Massachusetts.

833
01:03:21,973 --> 01:03:23,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's nice to know this context.

834
01:03:23,694 --> 01:03:27,397
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have an idea, guys.

835
01:03:27,437 --> 01:03:28,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Audrey.

836
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:29,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

837
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:33,682
[SPEAKER_06]: The new Medford Arts Collaborative, the Medford Arts Center on Mystic Ave.

838
01:03:34,563 --> 01:03:39,748
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps, I don't know how big we want to get with the picnic, but perhaps we just make a little flyer.

839
01:03:40,548 --> 01:03:41,848
[SPEAKER_06]: and throw it on there.

840
01:03:41,908 --> 01:03:43,449
[SPEAKER_06]: They have like a community table.

841
01:03:44,189 --> 01:03:47,110
[SPEAKER_06]: If we want to get new faces in there, just a thought.

842
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:53,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And then on the flyer we could say, you know, we are looking for volunteers for the picnic specifically.

843
01:03:53,232 --> 01:03:54,532
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, just a thought.

844
01:03:55,393 --> 01:03:58,554
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cachet newsletter too.

845
01:03:59,314 --> 01:04:01,995
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't say this too loud.

846
01:04:02,015 --> 01:04:02,615
[SPEAKER_01]: I might

847
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I like that.

848
01:04:09,003 --> 01:04:09,924
[SPEAKER_06]: I did not hear that.

849
01:04:10,364 --> 01:04:12,166
[SPEAKER_00]: She's got a secret gorilla that she's got.

850
01:04:12,226 --> 01:04:13,828
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one else heard it either.

851
01:04:15,704 --> 01:04:18,185
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can talk about it.

852
01:04:18,365 --> 01:04:19,425
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't talk about it.

853
01:04:19,445 --> 01:04:21,686
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in your ear, so you're okay.

854
01:04:22,646 --> 01:04:24,127
[SPEAKER_06]: You're volunteering him to grill?

855
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:24,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

856
01:04:25,367 --> 01:04:26,147
[SPEAKER_03]: Potentially.

857
01:04:26,347 --> 01:04:26,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

858
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:28,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll work on that.

859
01:04:28,848 --> 01:04:31,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if our regulars can come.

860
01:04:31,148 --> 01:04:33,289
[SPEAKER_03]: Among other things, I have to live with my neighbors here.

861
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:45,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, keep me posted and I'll get the sodas like I've gotten the past few years and I'm happy to do the shuttle.

862
01:04:46,332 --> 01:04:48,334
[SPEAKER_01]: My car can seat like five or six people.

863
01:04:49,656 --> 01:04:50,437
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine can seat one.

864
01:04:52,802 --> 01:04:59,867
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm always kind of in charge of the layout of the tents and the tables.

865
01:04:59,947 --> 01:05:02,469
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll do that and I'll do something else.

866
01:05:02,549 --> 01:05:03,690
[SPEAKER_06]: I just can't think right now.

867
01:05:04,771 --> 01:05:06,532
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had live music in the past.

868
01:05:06,592 --> 01:05:08,573
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember on the part on the van?

869
01:05:08,633 --> 01:05:13,117
[SPEAKER_06]: Anybody have anybody they they want to watch fest is coming up.

870
01:05:13,157 --> 01:05:15,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can solicit somebody I'll be working.

871
01:05:15,518 --> 01:05:17,600
[SPEAKER_03]: They just had somebody else in Somerville.

872
01:05:18,060 --> 01:05:20,802
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm coordinating my neighbor's porch for PorchFest.

873
01:05:20,862 --> 01:05:22,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm talking to a lot of bands right now.

874
01:05:22,603 --> 01:05:27,226
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we have a certain preference on Big Jon Short, I don't know if anyone knows who Big Jon Short is.

875
01:05:27,906 --> 01:05:35,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So a few years ago, Carly, we had just like they kind of just did covers of like, you know, mid tempo pop songs.

876
01:05:35,751 --> 01:05:38,133
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you know, pretty general.

877
01:05:38,965 --> 01:05:39,345
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

878
01:05:39,546 --> 01:05:40,626
[SPEAKER_01]: A crowd pleaser, you know?

879
01:05:40,646 --> 01:05:41,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.

880
01:05:41,447 --> 01:05:42,468
[SPEAKER_06]: They plugged in, right?

881
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:43,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Did they plug in?

882
01:05:43,829 --> 01:05:44,329
[SPEAKER_01]: They did.

883
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:46,351
[SPEAKER_01]: They had like a small little lamp.

884
01:05:46,591 --> 01:05:47,972
[SPEAKER_06]: And we did it on the veranda.

885
01:05:47,992 --> 01:05:48,393
[SPEAKER_06]: It was nice.

886
01:05:48,453 --> 01:05:48,873
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right.

887
01:05:48,913 --> 01:05:50,254
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really lovely.

888
01:05:50,274 --> 01:05:50,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

889
01:05:51,275 --> 01:05:51,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

890
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,496
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we

891
01:05:54,229 --> 01:05:57,110
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought we threw them a tiny teeny bit of money.

892
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:57,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we did.

893
01:05:57,570 --> 01:05:59,130
[SPEAKER_03]: We gave them a couple hundred bucks.

894
01:05:59,790 --> 01:05:59,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

895
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:02,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is, we're perfectly happy to fund that.

896
01:06:02,351 --> 01:06:05,551
[SPEAKER_06]: It was my friend Christian, yeah, but I'd like to get something else if we could.

897
01:06:06,032 --> 01:06:08,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, I'd be happy to be on that search as well.

898
01:06:08,332 --> 01:06:08,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

899
01:06:08,492 --> 01:06:09,532
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm already doing it another way.

900
01:06:09,852 --> 01:06:10,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

901
01:06:10,973 --> 01:06:13,253
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and they don't have to play for three hours.

902
01:06:13,313 --> 01:06:20,915
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we basically, you know, get rolling and then you have, you start the tours about one o'clock usually, et cetera.

903
01:06:22,085 --> 01:06:27,328
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, and I won't say this again, but it's remarkably weather dependent.

904
01:06:27,768 --> 01:06:30,530
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there have been times when it's really, really hot.

905
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:35,312
[SPEAKER_03]: At any rate, on the picnic, it sounds like it's in good hands.

906
01:06:35,372 --> 01:06:38,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just send lots of money and that'll... This is recorded.

907
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:40,955
[SPEAKER_00]: One final comment about the picnic totem.

908
01:06:40,975 --> 01:06:41,876
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be our chance

909
01:06:44,556 --> 01:06:46,298
[SPEAKER_00]: for what I call the Tom Lincoln roast.

910
01:06:46,618 --> 01:06:50,462
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is the time to bring it up.

911
01:06:50,542 --> 01:06:55,327
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the passing of the flame, you know, the turning of the generations.

912
01:06:55,427 --> 01:06:57,850
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like this is a great opportunity, Tom.

913
01:06:58,651 --> 01:07:00,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody is not far behind.

914
01:07:00,292 --> 01:07:01,814
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.

915
01:07:02,274 --> 01:07:02,735
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm excited.

916
01:07:11,453 --> 01:07:13,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll promise to be there at least for an hour.

917
01:07:13,534 --> 01:07:16,915
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a goofy idea.

918
01:07:17,855 --> 01:07:19,516
[SPEAKER_06]: Would cornhole be?

919
01:07:19,636 --> 01:07:20,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it cornhole?

920
01:07:21,056 --> 01:07:21,537
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.

921
01:07:21,557 --> 01:07:22,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Some lawn games?

922
01:07:22,677 --> 01:07:25,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have some lawn games?

923
01:07:25,638 --> 01:07:26,458
[SPEAKER_04]: I can bring some.

924
01:07:26,598 --> 01:07:29,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got nothing elaborate but just something.

925
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:30,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Cornhole is super fun.

926
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:30,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Can jam.

927
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,080
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like the sweetest lawn game.

928
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:35,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I play that cornhole game and it's

929
01:07:38,483 --> 01:07:41,887
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 times harder than it looks.

930
01:07:41,927 --> 01:07:48,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently, apparently it's the national sport of New Hampshire, the state sport in New Hampshire.

931
01:07:48,714 --> 01:07:58,264
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it's clearly they practice all winter in order to the other the other game that's a lot of fun is is is croquet.

932
01:07:59,252 --> 01:08:03,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it brings out the viciousness in people that otherwise are not vicious.

933
01:08:03,157 --> 01:08:07,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we have enough lawn for that, though, because we put the tables out on the lawn.

934
01:08:07,802 --> 01:08:10,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but the whole back lawn is not used down below.

935
01:08:10,705 --> 01:08:11,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's true, yeah.

936
01:08:12,267 --> 01:08:13,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that sounds great.

937
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,371
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great idea.

938
01:08:16,491 --> 01:08:22,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Audrey has often brought, you know, sort of some stuff for kids, crayons and that.

939
01:08:22,456 --> 01:08:23,517
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, the crafts bag.

940
01:08:23,537 --> 01:08:25,358
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we have a little crafts table, Carly.

941
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's fun.

942
01:08:26,919 --> 01:08:31,903
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just simple crafts with ribbons and sticks.

943
01:08:32,684 --> 01:08:34,245
[SPEAKER_06]: And Audrey, you said you usually do that?

944
01:08:34,725 --> 01:08:36,267
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have a whole bag of stuff.

945
01:08:36,947 --> 01:08:37,528
[SPEAKER_06]: Wonderful.

946
01:08:38,168 --> 01:08:38,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

947
01:08:38,488 --> 01:08:39,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm editing a document right now.

948
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:44,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, gosh, we know who can bring 5000 toy trucks.

949
01:08:44,986 --> 01:08:45,247
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.

950
01:08:51,424 --> 01:08:57,308
[SPEAKER_02]: I have an update on the Community Fund Committee, which is that they're meeting next Wednesday.

951
01:08:57,328 --> 01:09:03,812
[SPEAKER_02]: And they got more requests than they have funding available, which is different from the past.

952
01:09:04,492 --> 01:09:13,558
[SPEAKER_02]: But that folks could maybe, if they know anyone on the committee, put in a word for the Brooks Estate, and that may well help us get at least something.

953
01:09:13,678 --> 01:09:16,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will put the link in the chat.

954
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:18,281
[SPEAKER_02]: I know several, and I will

955
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:20,803
[SPEAKER_02]: do what I can.

956
01:09:20,863 --> 01:09:23,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Take him to Alta Cuba for a drink or two.

957
01:09:24,306 --> 01:09:29,871
[SPEAKER_01]: The names from the committee are on the city website.

958
01:09:29,891 --> 01:09:32,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just put a link in the chat.

959
01:09:32,273 --> 01:09:37,859
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the mayor, Justin Fang, Melanie McLaughlin, Aaron Rafferty.

960
01:09:37,879 --> 01:09:39,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Melanie's daughter lives right next to me.

961
01:09:40,421 --> 01:09:41,922
[SPEAKER_02]: If anyone knows Aaron Rafferty.

962
01:09:42,983 --> 01:09:48,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I actually don't know the other, well, maybe I do, but I'm, you know, I'd have to think about who the other people are.

963
01:09:48,567 --> 01:09:52,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Zach, if we don't get to both 25, 15 or 20 would go a long way, so.

964
01:09:52,369 --> 01:09:53,169
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned that.

965
01:09:53,289 --> 01:10:02,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, I think, you know, still if people want to send it, if they know anyone on here, send a text, send an email, let them know.

966
01:10:02,175 --> 01:10:03,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Justin owes me big time, so.

967
01:10:04,716 --> 01:10:05,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

968
01:10:06,297 --> 01:10:09,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to order a croquet set or do we have one?

969
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:11,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I'm looking on Amazon right now.

970
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:12,688
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just order them.

971
01:10:15,631 --> 01:10:16,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it handmade in France?

972
01:10:17,812 --> 01:10:25,479
[SPEAKER_01]: No, there's like, like there's a couple of decent ones that come with like the mallets, the spikes, then they come with like a little bag so you can keep it all.

973
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:27,620
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also big yard dice.

974
01:10:30,162 --> 01:10:32,945
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that thing that you fling the things in it?

975
01:10:33,645 --> 01:10:36,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a, like a rack.

976
01:10:37,895 --> 01:10:39,216
[SPEAKER_01]: The one with the thing with the balls?

977
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:39,936
[SPEAKER_01]: The golf balls?

978
01:10:39,976 --> 01:10:43,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's one on each end, and you go like this.

979
01:10:43,097 --> 01:10:45,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know anything about that.

980
01:10:45,437 --> 01:10:46,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Golf ladder or something like that.

981
01:10:46,878 --> 01:10:48,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't know that game.

982
01:10:48,538 --> 01:10:54,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it, but it's not really flat enough for bocce, right?

983
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:55,620
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

984
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a bocce set.

985
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:58,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll bring it.

986
01:10:58,461 --> 01:11:02,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I love bocce, because I know how to make all those side bets, you know?

987
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:03,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from Medford.

988
01:11:03,422 --> 01:11:04,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand how to make it tight.

989
01:11:07,092 --> 01:11:07,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, boy.

990
01:11:07,672 --> 01:11:08,293
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

991
01:11:08,453 --> 01:11:12,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to order a couple sets of yard games and call it a donation.

992
01:11:13,016 --> 01:11:14,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

993
01:11:14,276 --> 01:11:15,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

994
01:11:15,977 --> 01:11:17,078
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're done with the agenda.

995
01:11:17,098 --> 01:11:18,559
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have one last item.

996
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:20,760
[SPEAKER_01]: The Girl Scout thing, Doug.

997
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:21,180
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.

998
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:21,460
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.

999
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:23,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's do that first, Jen.

1000
01:11:23,982 --> 01:11:25,403
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to Tom about this earlier today.

1001
01:11:25,463 --> 01:11:33,367
[SPEAKER_00]: We think what she put down for the mustard removal is the best one because it's easy.

1002
01:11:33,447 --> 01:11:34,688
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no chemicals involved.

1003
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:36,209
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no phasing involved.

1004
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:39,032
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's an easy one to say yes to.

1005
01:11:39,092 --> 01:11:40,453
[SPEAKER_00]: It's along the road, right, Tom?

1006
01:11:40,493 --> 01:11:41,194
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know what you mean?

1007
01:11:42,174 --> 01:11:42,895
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere.

1008
01:11:42,975 --> 01:11:44,837
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for a project at the high school.

1009
01:11:44,857 --> 01:11:45,857
[SPEAKER_06]: It's everywhere.

1010
01:11:46,458 --> 01:11:47,719
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great, yeah, exactly.

1011
01:11:47,799 --> 01:11:50,481
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just want permission to come to the estate and do it.

1012
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:53,404
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, we're just going to point them in the right direction.

1013
01:11:54,124 --> 01:11:55,005
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be done.

1014
01:11:55,205 --> 01:11:55,485
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1015
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:59,549
[SPEAKER_03]: But I told Doug that the only condition is that because this

1016
01:12:00,712 --> 01:12:06,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Garlic mustard is a delicacy, and Doug is a famous salad eater.

1017
01:12:06,595 --> 01:12:08,977
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to make pesto and sell it.

1018
01:12:09,557 --> 01:12:15,440
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we're going to make Doug a big salad and see if he can eat it.

1019
01:12:15,501 --> 01:12:18,622
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to charge us $100 a head to watch me eat that mustard from the state.

1020
01:12:19,143 --> 01:12:20,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It cannot be composted.

1021
01:12:20,443 --> 01:12:23,605
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to be put in trash bags so it won't spread.

1022
01:12:25,470 --> 01:12:27,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we can provide the trash bags.

1023
01:12:27,392 --> 01:12:29,754
[SPEAKER_06]: It's everywhere this year, everywhere.

1024
01:12:30,114 --> 01:12:33,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, by the way, guys, I was up there birding a couple of times.

1025
01:12:35,299 --> 01:12:42,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there was one day there was this huge 18-wheeler that came up to the stump dump and took a bunch of stumps away.

1026
01:12:42,385 --> 01:12:46,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I asked the guys, are you removing stuff from the stump dump?

1027
01:12:46,748 --> 01:12:47,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And they said, yeah.

1028
01:12:48,190 --> 01:12:51,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And then two other days, there were smaller trucks that were bringing stuff in and dumping it.

1029
01:12:52,393 --> 01:12:54,513
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't get it.

1030
01:12:55,374 --> 01:12:57,914
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you what's happening there.

1031
01:12:58,314 --> 01:13:03,715
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a long, I don't want to extend the meeting here, but this has been a long thorn.

1032
01:13:04,876 --> 01:13:09,697
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had a number of discussions with Tim McGibbon and promises have been made.

1033
01:13:10,617 --> 01:13:17,098
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the city did a good job with that, and then they dropped the ball for about five or six years in a huge mountain.

1034
01:13:17,178 --> 01:13:18,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's no other word for it.

1035
01:13:18,698 --> 01:13:20,099
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's gone now, a lot of it.

1036
01:13:23,021 --> 01:13:23,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've talked about this.

1037
01:13:24,182 --> 01:13:31,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I think our beef is that in doing that, they've messed up other parts of that whole area.

1038
01:13:31,986 --> 01:13:34,347
[SPEAKER_03]: And Tim McGivern said that they would fix that.

1039
01:13:34,407 --> 01:13:35,808
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think they've fixed that yet.

1040
01:13:35,868 --> 01:13:38,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was, I talked to him a year ago, October.

1041
01:13:39,049 --> 01:13:41,711
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it distinctly.

1042
01:13:43,272 --> 01:13:45,893
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cemetery expansion is the opportunity.

1043
01:13:46,953 --> 01:13:49,753
[SPEAKER_00]: It will force the issue to fix all this stuff.

1044
01:13:49,834 --> 01:13:51,914
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't build that without it.

1045
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:53,514
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not their land, though, is it?

1046
01:13:55,414 --> 01:13:56,475
[SPEAKER_00]: It overlaps part of it.

1047
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:57,155
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it does.

1048
01:13:57,695 --> 01:13:58,455
[SPEAKER_06]: You're kidding me.

1049
01:13:58,515 --> 01:14:00,495
[SPEAKER_06]: That is like prime birding area.

1050
01:14:00,815 --> 01:14:02,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Prime bird area.

1051
01:14:02,336 --> 01:14:03,816
[SPEAKER_06]: That's horrible.

1052
01:14:06,516 --> 01:14:07,216
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.

1053
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,117
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a line on the map that we don't own.

1054
01:14:09,437 --> 01:14:10,197
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not our land.

1055
01:14:10,397 --> 01:14:11,097
[SPEAKER_00]: All we can do is have it.

1056
01:14:11,137 --> 01:14:13,898
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was down more towards the road for some reason.

1057
01:14:19,008 --> 01:14:21,630
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a matter of design.

1058
01:14:21,650 --> 01:14:29,514
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact is that, setting that aside for a second, the stump dump is both a lot better and a lot worse than it's ever been.

1059
01:14:30,555 --> 01:14:36,738
[SPEAKER_03]: It's better because they used to chip there and they were gradually chipping and chipping and chipping and just covering the whole area.

1060
01:14:37,538 --> 01:14:40,240
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got them years ago to stop doing that.

1061
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:46,259
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really, there was a pretty good stasis going on there where they would, it would come once or twice a year and clear it out.

1062
01:14:46,359 --> 01:14:47,539
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they stopped doing that.

1063
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:56,783
[SPEAKER_03]: And just like everything else, like the tree stumps around Medford, they got way behind the eight ball, the proverbial eight ball.

1064
01:14:57,703 --> 01:15:03,505
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, they've been, they've been trying to get the reason you saw the trucks there recently is because they ran out of money.

1065
01:15:04,332 --> 01:15:08,694
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier and they've found some more money to get more of it done.

1066
01:15:08,854 --> 01:15:10,575
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how things work.

1067
01:15:11,075 --> 01:15:18,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact is, the DPW needs not to be there.

1068
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:27,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Setting aside whether there'll be cemetery expansion, et cetera, it's been a convenience for them, but not a necessity.

1069
01:15:27,784 --> 01:15:29,445
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other ways to manage this.

1070
01:15:29,979 --> 01:15:42,544
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they completely ignored the issue when they built the new DPW yard and didn't provide for this on that acreage because they've always done it that way.

1071
01:15:42,584 --> 01:15:46,666
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's always been really convenient also for the cemetery.

1072
01:15:47,266 --> 01:15:49,587
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is stuff from the, but there's stuff from the cemetery.

1073
01:15:50,267 --> 01:15:54,269
[SPEAKER_03]: And we finally got them to stop dumping plastic flowers and all that stuff.

1074
01:15:54,989 --> 01:15:55,629
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's 60 or 70 years of,

1075
01:15:59,182 --> 01:16:04,283
[SPEAKER_03]: less than ideal behavior going on, you know, on the whole property.

1076
01:16:04,343 --> 01:16:08,384
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, we've made a lot of progress, but we haven't solved this particular issue.

1077
01:16:08,904 --> 01:16:10,825
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ask one more simple thing.

1078
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:18,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Just briefly, there's a bunch of little green signs that say conservation land boundary.

1079
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:19,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1080
01:16:19,507 --> 01:16:20,667
[SPEAKER_06]: For the reservation, right?

1081
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:22,188
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's asking me about them.

1082
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:23,388
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people are.

1083
01:16:23,488 --> 01:16:26,069
[SPEAKER_03]: That is that we talked about.

1084
01:16:26,389 --> 01:16:27,889
[SPEAKER_03]: It took years to get that.

1085
01:16:28,891 --> 01:16:34,396
[SPEAKER_03]: Under the conservation preservation restriction, you need to mark the boundaries.

1086
01:16:34,476 --> 01:16:43,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, we got the DCR, found some money, and did the surveying and marked those, which is very useful, I think.

1087
01:16:44,344 --> 01:16:48,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think, you know, you'll see some along the grocery side too.

1088
01:16:49,448 --> 01:16:56,113
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we discussed it, they put in a lot, you know, there's no real rule of thumb about how many, you don't,

1089
01:16:58,414 --> 01:17:10,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you don't put them every five feet, but also, you know, there's a reasonable number there is all I'm going to say in terms of how that's worked out.

1090
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:19,744
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing with the DCR is it's, you know, it takes them years, years to get anything done.

1091
01:17:19,784 --> 01:17:21,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, like everybody else.

1092
01:17:24,303 --> 01:17:28,487
[SPEAKER_03]: So what else do we have here before I disappear into the twilight?

1093
01:17:29,248 --> 01:17:32,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have one other small thing that I don't think Audrey has heard about yet.

1094
01:17:32,871 --> 01:17:39,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone else has been on this email chain, but our representation at the Medford farmers market.

1095
01:17:39,898 --> 01:17:43,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Audrey, I'm not sure if you're familiar with the community table that they have at the farmers market.

1096
01:17:43,962 --> 01:17:44,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think so.

1097
01:17:45,512 --> 01:17:48,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so they basically offer signups.

1098
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:53,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Every week, there's a new organization, nonprofit entity that sits there.

1099
01:17:53,879 --> 01:17:57,102
[SPEAKER_04]: So I signed us up for a week to have mbelt representation there.

1100
01:17:57,883 --> 01:17:59,244
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will be July 29.

1101
01:17:59,924 --> 01:18:01,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, August 29, 29.

1102
01:18:04,688 --> 01:18:05,909
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why it's easy to remember.

1103
01:18:06,550 --> 01:18:10,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's a Thursday before Labor Day.

1104
01:18:10,293 --> 01:18:12,155
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's, as john mentioned, the last

1105
01:18:12,783 --> 01:18:16,205
[SPEAKER_04]: concert series evening for the summer, which is really nice.

1106
01:18:16,245 --> 01:18:17,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully that means we get a nice turnout.

1107
01:18:18,747 --> 01:18:23,910
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Audrey will include you on the planning for that now that I have your email address.

1108
01:18:25,111 --> 01:18:28,733
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to collect some ideas about what sorts of things we want to have at the table.

1109
01:18:29,013 --> 01:18:31,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, some of those postcards would be great.

1110
01:18:32,778 --> 01:18:33,498
[SPEAKER_04]: the banner.

1111
01:18:33,518 --> 01:18:34,999
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to unload all those.

1112
01:18:35,259 --> 01:18:35,959
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.

1113
01:18:36,059 --> 01:18:37,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it all to me, Tom.

1114
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:37,700
[SPEAKER_04]: That's perfect.

1115
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:43,543
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll see if we can come up with some volunteer opportunities that we can get people to sign up for on the spot there as well.

1116
01:18:43,563 --> 01:18:46,584
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can have them on the hook.

1117
01:18:47,744 --> 01:18:54,787
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that's that's sitting up at the manor in a couple versions are is a tabletop display.

1118
01:18:55,428 --> 01:18:57,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1119
01:18:57,328 --> 01:18:59,489
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably needs some updating.

1120
01:18:59,669 --> 01:18:59,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1121
01:19:00,090 --> 01:19:00,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And etc.

1122
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:00,830
[SPEAKER_03]: But

1123
01:19:01,899 --> 01:19:06,387
[SPEAKER_03]: The times that we've done this, that's worked really well.

1124
01:19:06,727 --> 01:19:11,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It weighs more than five pounds, but it's not like setting up a huge canopy or something.

1125
01:19:11,884 --> 01:19:12,484
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's great.

1126
01:19:12,524 --> 01:19:15,827
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now I'm planning on Jen and I definitely being there from three to seven.

1127
01:19:15,847 --> 01:19:17,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Doug's not available.

1128
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:19,269
[SPEAKER_04]: Zach, you said if it works out, you'll swing by.

1129
01:19:19,809 --> 01:19:21,730
[SPEAKER_04]: So that offer is still absolutely open.

1130
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:30,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom, if it works out for you, I know that if somebody asked me about the history, I'm going to make up as much as I can and sound convincing, but I'm not going to be as good as you are.

1131
01:19:30,796 --> 01:19:32,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be taking birthday contributions.

1132
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:40,986
[SPEAKER_03]: You see Doug at the market a lot over by where they sell the fruits and vegetables.

1133
01:19:42,067 --> 01:19:46,772
[SPEAKER_01]: No, see, the reason you go when there's the concerts is because they have the beer tent.

1134
01:19:46,952 --> 01:19:47,473
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.

1135
01:19:47,593 --> 01:19:48,434
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

1136
01:19:48,514 --> 01:19:49,535
[SPEAKER_01]: That I haven't seen.

1137
01:19:50,395 --> 01:19:52,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because I sponsor the concerts.

1138
01:19:53,457 --> 01:19:55,137
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Doug, you do too.

1139
01:19:55,898 --> 01:19:59,139
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the best, the best nights of the summer to go.

1140
01:19:59,759 --> 01:20:00,700
[SPEAKER_01]: They're so fun.

1141
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:01,300
[SPEAKER_04]: They are.

1142
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:06,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just like we go with all our daycare friends and all the kids run around and it's just this wonderful environment.

1143
01:20:06,482 --> 01:20:16,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's going to be a nice way for us to be in the kind of demographic that we want of like young, active Medford residents who love their city.

1144
01:20:18,150 --> 01:20:20,931
[SPEAKER_03]: The, what does it cost to sponsor a concert?

1145
01:20:22,492 --> 01:20:24,753
[SPEAKER_01]: I do the whole season and I think it's $500.

1146
01:20:24,893 --> 01:20:28,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, chump change.

1147
01:20:29,475 --> 01:20:32,676
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like five salads.

1148
01:20:34,136 --> 01:20:36,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1149
01:20:36,817 --> 01:20:38,698
[SPEAKER_01]: The money just goes to cachet, so.

1150
01:20:39,038 --> 01:20:42,000
[SPEAKER_01]: And they use it to like pay the band and get the band's time.

1151
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:42,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, yeah.

1152
01:20:43,180 --> 01:20:43,540
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.

1153
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:44,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing happens without money.

1154
01:20:45,281 --> 01:20:45,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1155
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:46,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1156
01:20:46,587 --> 01:20:48,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like the top level.

1157
01:20:48,408 --> 01:20:52,051
[SPEAKER_03]: That's like, I get my, I wouldn't expect you to be anywhere but the top level.

1158
01:20:56,394 --> 01:21:02,738
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I have, if anyone, if we're done is I just want to, first of all, thank Tom, obviously for it.

1159
01:21:02,758 --> 01:21:09,383
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do this a picnic as well for an infinite amount of work over the time, over the years, over the decades.

1160
01:21:10,083 --> 01:21:15,467
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do want to take you and your selfless wife, Donna, out to dinner at some point.

1161
01:21:16,297 --> 01:21:22,743
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can apologize for making your life so difficult the last three decades with the Brooks Estate.

1162
01:21:23,624 --> 01:21:27,087
[SPEAKER_00]: And have a nice celebration and a nice dinner somewhere.

1163
01:21:27,708 --> 01:21:29,649
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll circulate dates during the summer.

1164
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:30,230
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

1165
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

1166
01:21:32,132 --> 01:21:32,872
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like that.

1167
01:21:32,912 --> 01:21:35,555
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the least we can do for all you've done.

1168
01:21:36,716 --> 01:21:37,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1169
01:21:38,522 --> 01:22:04,575

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1174
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:14,604
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do that probably, probably by the middle of next week at the latest.

1175
01:22:14,644 --> 01:22:17,987
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because you said we have to have them out two weeks prior.

1176
01:22:18,247 --> 01:22:20,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Two weeks prior, yeah.

1177
01:22:20,609 --> 01:22:24,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a week from today is two weeks prior, so that's perfect.

1178
01:22:24,432 --> 01:22:27,035
[SPEAKER_03]: So next week is

1179
01:22:28,142 --> 01:22:32,065
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I have to take a break from the kitchen job once in a while.

1180
01:22:32,385 --> 01:22:38,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I wanna thank everybody for all their help over all this time, new and old members of the board.

1181
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:46,235
[SPEAKER_03]: I look forward to trying to contribute further in the future based on items of my choosing, of course.

1182
01:22:46,755 --> 01:22:49,077
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm just joking.

1183
01:22:49,417 --> 01:22:50,238
[SPEAKER_03]: And then go from there.

1184
01:22:50,318 --> 01:22:55,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And Carly, we'll look forward to your participation and more.

1185
01:22:57,144 --> 01:23:10,288
[SPEAKER_03]: And you and I, certainly, I'm generally around, not always next to my phone, which I mostly can't find, but you know where to find it, as it were.

1186
01:23:10,868 --> 01:23:14,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll see everybody soon.

1187
01:23:14,269 --> 01:23:15,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Love it.
