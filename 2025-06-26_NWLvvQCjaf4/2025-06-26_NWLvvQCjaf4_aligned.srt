00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,695
Welcome to tonight's meeting of the method committee development board.

2
00:00:04,697 --> 00:00:05,878
I'll call the meeting to order.

3
00:00:06,199 --> 00:00:09,144
Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters 1st.

4
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:16,764
This hearing of the Method Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

5
00:00:16,844 --> 00:00:27,407
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the procedures as provided for in Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023.

6
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:37,951
A reminder that anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting while in progress may do so by accessing the link that was included on the meeting agenda posted on the City of Method's website.

7
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:42,112
If despite our best efforts, we are not able to provide a real-time access,

8
00:00:42,912 --> 00:00:46,534
We will post a recording of this meeting on the city's website as soon as possible.

9
00:00:46,554 --> 00:00:51,636
A reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting, tonight all votes from the board will be made by roll call.

10
00:00:53,237 --> 00:00:59,420
Please note that the project materials for all projects before the board can be viewed at the city's website, which is MedfordMA.org.

11
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,562
And you can click on current city board filings, which you can find the link in the chat.

12
00:01:07,604 --> 00:01:09,165
I'm going to do roll call attendance.

13
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:11,826
Sally Akiki.

14
00:01:21,496 --> 00:01:22,457
Can you hear me?

15
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:23,618
Present.

16
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:24,038
Present?

17
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:24,599
Yes.

18
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:25,560
Thank you.

19
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:26,781
Peter Kautz?

20
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:28,102
Present.

21
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:29,643
Sabrina Alpino?

22
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:30,904
Present.

23
00:01:31,585 --> 00:01:33,106
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

24
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:37,870
Danielle, can you introduce any city staff on the call?

25
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,494
Flying solo tonight, just me, Danielle Evans, senior planner.

26
00:01:42,915 --> 00:01:43,395
Okay.

27
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:50,001
All right, well, the first item on agenda for this evening is 1416 Mystic Valley Parkway.

28
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,463
It's a special permit for a detached ADU.

29
00:01:54,004 --> 00:01:57,086
This is a new public hearing, and I'll read the public hearing notice.

30
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:11,215
The Memphis Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on August 7, 2024, after 6.30 p.m., remotely via Zoom, relative to an application submitted by Nancy Russa, for a special permit for a detached, essentially dwelling unit, ADU.

31
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:34,772
The applicant is seeking to legalize and renovate an existing ADU and an existing detached garage structure on the same lot at Lot J-01-9, 1416 Mystic Valley Parkway, Mayford Mass 02155, which requires a special permit for Chapter 94, Section 8.2.2, City of Mayford Zoning Ordinance.

32
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:38,875
Danielle, can you please provide any introductory comments?

33
00:02:41,957 --> 00:03:01,237
Um, yes, so, um, this, um, as the legal ad, uh, described, this is an existing, um, detached garage, um, has an existing, um, ADU or some kind of living space that's there.

34
00:03:01,257 --> 00:03:02,899
I think that predates their ownership.

35
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:15,349
And I believe that this came to our attention when they applied for a building permit to do some work in there, and then learned that they needed to actually have a special permit for this.

36
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:17,791
So they are now here before us.

37
00:03:18,832 --> 00:03:21,374
And I'll turn it over to Ms.

38
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:21,774
Woosa.

39
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:24,597
I'll unmute you.

40
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:27,817
Great, yeah.

41
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:30,779
So I have some pictures.

42
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,420
I've just introduced my husband, Alex Moot.

43
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,321
And my sister, Betsy Rosa, is on the call.

44
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:40,583
She is, fortunately for me, an architect who has done a lot of work for us.

45
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:49,907
So I have some pictures that I can share with you of the plans, the neighborhood, so on and so forth, if that would be helpful.

46
00:03:52,004 --> 00:03:56,427
Yeah, I can make you a co-host so that you can host the stream.

47
00:03:56,547 --> 00:03:59,088
I think that's the only way to do it.

48
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:04,652
Oh, yeah, I'm disabled.

49
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:07,273
You should be able to do so now.

50
00:04:07,854 --> 00:04:08,214
OK.

51
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:10,215
Yes, great.

52
00:04:11,976 --> 00:04:13,377
Now, how do I get to my?

53
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,140
Give me a minute and I will get to the pictures.

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,661
No, that's.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,303
There you go.

56
00:04:28,844 --> 00:04:29,485
Yeah, there we go.

57
00:04:29,585 --> 00:04:31,407
So it's the ADU presentation right there.

58
00:04:31,908 --> 00:04:32,268
Right there.

59
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:33,770
Perfect.

60
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,290
OK.

61
00:04:34,931 --> 00:04:35,572
Is that shared?

62
00:04:35,592 --> 00:04:36,613
Can everyone see it?

63
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:37,374
Oh, OK.

64
00:04:37,434 --> 00:04:38,375
To make it active.

65
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:41,699
Oh, got it.

66
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,180
OK.

67
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:43,722
I'm glad you're here.

68
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:45,184
OK.

69
00:04:46,305 --> 00:04:47,206
Yay, there we go.

70
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:51,809
So this is a picture of the property.

71
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:57,634
It's this large red roof structure in the middle left-hand side of the picture.

72
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:02,698
And on the right-hand side of that is the garage apartment dwelling unit.

73
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,220
Yeah, that is.

74
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,664
So we bought the property in October 1998 and have lived there very happily since.

75
00:05:12,777 --> 00:05:13,857
Let me go on.

76
00:05:13,937 --> 00:05:15,898
How do I go to the next one?

77
00:05:16,438 --> 00:05:17,058
You scroll down.

78
00:05:17,398 --> 00:05:17,658
Okay.

79
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:18,338
Oh, there we go.

80
00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:18,658
Great.

81
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:24,019
It's the small red roof is the garage with the apartment above it.

82
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:29,380
Then that's a picture just of the streets in the neighborhood and our lot is in obviously the yellow.

83
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:37,282
This is a plot plan, again, the house and the two-story garage.

84
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:40,343
going down.

85
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:42,666
So the house was built in 1910.

86
00:05:42,706 --> 00:05:53,956
At that time, it was common to have a detached garage, and we believe that the dwelling unit over the garage was probably used for a chauffeur or servant or something.

87
00:05:54,556 --> 00:05:57,399
This is the floor plan of the garage, the first floor.

88
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,101
We've added new

89
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:09,587
hardwired smoke detectors and heat detectors and insulation, which were requirements from the building department, and they've approved that.

90
00:06:09,767 --> 00:06:11,168
So that's all done, I think.

91
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:16,413
Oh, back to the neighborhood too.

92
00:06:17,254 --> 00:06:25,055
I have reached out to all the abutters that the city provided a list of all the abutters within 400 feet.

93
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:31,177
I've emailed with all of the 15 households that I knew.

94
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:37,158
And then I sent hand-delivered letters to the 25 or so households that I don't know.

95
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:44,240
I know that the immediate neighbors that I've spoken with are all in agreement with this, have no trouble with it.

96
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,701
Okay, so there's the garage again.

97
00:06:46,721 --> 00:06:52,623
And we have off-street parking for two cars in that garage, obviously.

98
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:56,265
So this is the floor plan for the dwelling unit.

99
00:06:56,305 --> 00:07:01,326
You can see on the right-hand side of the picture are some existing stairs.

100
00:07:01,907 --> 00:07:10,010
So you go up those stairs to the main door, and then there's a little, you know, tiny kitchenette and bathroom and living space.

101
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:20,378
On the top of the picture, you can see that we've added a new door, which was, again, a building department requirement for a second egress in case of fire.

102
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,803
So that new door is now in there as some pictures will make clear soon.

103
00:07:26,664 --> 00:07:28,846
So this is, again, just a picture from the street.

104
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:36,072
We have taken away all that ivy, but that's the two-car garage and the unit above and the steps to the right.

105
00:07:36,412 --> 00:07:36,833
Keep going.

106
00:07:40,113 --> 00:07:45,962
This is, again, just another view, the pictures, yeah, just the view from the whatever side that is.

107
00:07:45,982 --> 00:07:47,525
Keep going.

108
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:54,948
And this is a picture of the side facing our house.

109
00:07:55,508 --> 00:08:03,070
The picture above is the old view, and now the one below shows the new door with a new patio.

110
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:14,052
Through this process, we've had a lot of interactions with the building department, and they've told us what we need to do, and I think we're in compliance with all of their regulations.

111
00:08:14,632 --> 00:08:19,233
That second egress was really the one thing that was very important to do.

112
00:08:20,073 --> 00:08:21,034
Okay, so go on.

113
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:23,236
And that's just the other side.

114
00:08:23,296 --> 00:08:29,382
Again, most of that ivy is gone, but it does grow pretty ferociously, so I won't promise it's going to stay gone.

115
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:35,288
So we think that we've met all the requirements for an ADU, and we hope that you'll give us approval.

116
00:08:35,709 --> 00:08:37,550
Does anybody have any questions about any of this?

117
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,193
Thank you, Ms.

118
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:40,653
Rosa.

119
00:08:40,914 --> 00:08:41,875
I appreciate it.

120
00:08:43,371 --> 00:08:45,152
I will open it up to the board for questions.

121
00:08:45,232 --> 00:08:54,576
One of the things for clarity that I want, Danielle, can you please just quickly go back to the, I didn't hear the second ingress as part of the requirements that have been met.

122
00:08:55,556 --> 00:08:57,637
What were the things that were in compliance already?

123
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:09,281
So it's all brought up to meet building code and we did an analysis of all the conditions to meet

124
00:09:11,808 --> 00:09:15,970
for detached accessory dwelling unit, it meets the size thresholds.

125
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:19,812
It's already a building that's in existence.

126
00:09:21,273 --> 00:09:39,003
The only condition or criterion that you all need to cite upon is there's language in the ADU ordinance that says, let me see where my phone is.

127
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:53,241
Okay, so it's criterion number seven, which is that there should be sufficient and appropriate space for no more than one additional parking space when necessary and feasible.

128
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:58,404
It shall be accommodated on site by the owner to serve the accessory dwelling unit.

129
00:09:58,965 --> 00:10:05,630
So there is not an additional parking space being added.

130
00:10:09,172 --> 00:10:10,393
It's preexisting.

131
00:10:10,413 --> 00:10:11,214
So, I mean,

132
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:27,094
There's some discretion that your board has on whether you think an additional space is necessary, or if it's feasible, there are some topography challenges on the Sagamore side.

133
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:34,838
So I don't know what the parking pressures are on that street.

134
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:41,942
As staff, we generally don't want additional parking spaces if we don't need them.

135
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:52,889
but ultimately I defer to this board to make that decision whether you think that criterion is satisfied.

136
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:58,210
How many parking spaces are included as of right now?

137
00:10:59,351 --> 00:11:01,511
There's two in the garage.

138
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:04,212
There's no surface parking on

139
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,354
We do have a little bit of space.

140
00:11:08,434 --> 00:11:16,559
I mean, if you go back to the basic street plan, the garage unit is right on the street.

141
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,203
But there is a little bit of a setback that's wide enough for a car there.

142
00:11:21,823 --> 00:11:27,027
So when we have to clear the street for street cleaning, we can fit a car there.

143
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:29,528
I tend to park there all the time.

144
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:31,890
We've never parked our cars in the garage.

145
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:34,961
So where do you park on?

146
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:35,861
On the street.

147
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:38,564
There's a lot of parking available.

148
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:46,870
Yeah, for really the entire our side of Sagamorav from the garage north to our neighbor's house.

149
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,153
There are, there's never any other cars there.

150
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:54,076
So, we could probably fit 10 cars along the street there if you wanted to.

151
00:11:56,037 --> 00:12:02,102
I'm not, I'm not sure exactly where our property line ends on this map, but we just always parked in the street.

152
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:06,102
But there are two parking spaces in the garage.

153
00:12:06,402 --> 00:12:07,062
Yeah, within the garage.

154
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:11,804
And so the requirement for a single family is two spaces.

155
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:16,967
So you're conforming for the single family use.

156
00:12:17,647 --> 00:12:28,011
And it's the AD ordinance that says that an additional space should be provided, but if it's necessary or feasible.

157
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:33,628
Based on topography, it's not feasible.

158
00:12:33,688 --> 00:12:39,411
It'd be more of a hardship than anything at this point for adding the unnecessary parking.

159
00:12:40,031 --> 00:12:40,351
Yeah.

160
00:12:40,391 --> 00:12:54,737
I think based on what they've said about that surface space that may not be a formal parking space but functions as one, then that would theoretically satisfy the condition anyway of an additional parking space as part of the AD ordinance.

161
00:12:54,817 --> 00:12:56,038
I think that shouldn't be a problem.

162
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,762
Yeah, I definitely agree and with that, I'm going to open it up if if the board has any questions for the questions.

163
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:07,043
I don't think so.

164
00:13:07,103 --> 00:13:08,924
I think figure that out and that's.

165
00:13:09,944 --> 00:13:12,625
That should be that satisfies the parking questions.

166
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:13,565
Yeah.

167
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:20,128
And I think that's the only thing that we were really weighing on if it meets all other building codes, I'm actually going to.

168
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:28,300
ask for a motion to approve the special permit for 1416 Mystic Valley Parkways ADU.

169
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:30,361
So moved.

170
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:31,942
Second.

171
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:34,204
I, Sally, second.

172
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:36,826
I'm going to do roll call.

173
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:38,187
Sally Akiki?

174
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:39,368
Yes.

175
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:40,729
Peter Klaus?

176
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:41,650
Yes.

177
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,271
Sabrina Alpino?

178
00:13:43,951 --> 00:13:44,152
Yes.

179
00:13:45,147 --> 00:13:46,928
and myself, Jackie McPherson.

180
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:49,449
Actually, I have to back up a little bit.

181
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:57,152
I jumped the gun, and this is a public hearing, so I am going to open it up in case there's any public comments.

182
00:13:57,232 --> 00:14:05,235
Although we voted ahead, I do have to give the public a chance to speak.

183
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:14,198
So I'm going to go back and open up the public comment period, and those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

184
00:14:14,877 --> 00:14:18,759
You can also send an email to OCD at MedRate-MA.gov.

185
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:23,021
Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

186
00:14:23,522 --> 00:14:29,725
A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

187
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:36,869
However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself or staff.

188
00:14:38,206 --> 00:14:44,730
Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters that you may have received?

189
00:14:46,992 --> 00:14:53,215
Madam Chair, I don't see anyone in the participant list with their hand raised.

190
00:14:53,756 --> 00:15:00,700
I'll also add because it's a public hearing, we did mail out notices to the abutters.

191
00:15:01,481 --> 00:15:04,943
So everyone received that legal notice.

192
00:15:11,697 --> 00:15:29,151
Seeing no public comment and hearing that there has not been anything received, I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting, and I'm going to revert back to the original vote with Peter Kalbs making the first motion and Sally Akiki seconded.

193
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,433
I will do the roll call to make it complete.

194
00:15:32,074 --> 00:15:32,854
Sally Akiki.

195
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:34,316
Aye.

196
00:15:35,176 --> 00:15:35,837
Peter Kalbs.

197
00:15:36,577 --> 00:15:36,718
Aye.

198
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:37,919
Sabrina Alpino.

199
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:38,059
Aye.

200
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:41,046
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

201
00:15:42,027 --> 00:15:44,189
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Russo.

202
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:46,951
You're all set.

203
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:48,452
Thank you so much.

204
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:49,573
I really appreciate it.

205
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,496
I appreciate your time and thank you guys for doing what you do.

206
00:15:52,696 --> 00:15:53,096
Yeah.

207
00:15:53,176 --> 00:15:53,576
Thank you.

208
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:54,617
Have a great evening.

209
00:15:54,978 --> 00:15:55,338
Thanks.

210
00:15:55,358 --> 00:15:55,638
Bye-bye.

211
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:56,279
Bye-bye.

212
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:03,105
Our second agenda item is approval not required for 98 to 100 Magoon Ave.

213
00:16:09,617 --> 00:16:15,358
I have, I'm sorry, I do not have the applicant's name readily available.

214
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:20,799
Oh, yeah, because it's not a public hearing.

215
00:16:20,819 --> 00:16:21,539
I don't have that in there.

216
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:22,400
Apologies.

217
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,561
Leave it Angelo, correct?

218
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:30,221
Yes.

219
00:16:30,241 --> 00:16:32,742
I have to pull up the application.

220
00:16:32,762 --> 00:16:38,943
Mr. Angel, Angel is your last, your surname?

221
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:42,666
No, first name is Angelo, last name is Sterianos.

222
00:16:43,866 --> 00:16:46,927
Mr. Sterianos, thank you for being here with us this evening.

223
00:16:47,488 --> 00:16:57,191
I'm going to have the city lead us and give us a brief discussion, a brief overview, and then we'll have you introduce yourself and the project, okay?

224
00:16:59,092 --> 00:16:59,352
Yes.

225
00:17:00,872 --> 00:17:05,134
Yes, so we received this application for an approval not required.

226
00:17:06,254 --> 00:17:07,715
Basically, that means that

227
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:28,641
as part of the subdivision control law, if it meets the frontage requirements, and if it meets the other standards, which are, if both lots will front on a right of way, and if they, yeah, minimum frontage, and is there vital access to the lots?

228
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:34,743
So if it meets those, then the board is required to endorse it.

229
00:17:35,284 --> 00:17:37,525
That's why they call it the approval not required.

230
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:43,330
Neighboring cities have opted out of subdivision control law, so they don't do these.

231
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,572
It would just be something that the planning director would sign administratively.

232
00:17:48,513 --> 00:17:58,359
So it's sort of a perfunctory exercise when they're straightforward like this one is.

233
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,802
So I can show the plan unless

234
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:10,623
Mr. Stariano, did you want to share anything or would you prefer that I share the plan?

235
00:18:10,643 --> 00:18:18,911
You're muted.

236
00:18:19,652 --> 00:18:19,872
Yeah.

237
00:18:20,212 --> 00:18:22,935
No, I think it's pretty straightforward.

238
00:18:22,955 --> 00:18:25,897
We purchased a home with a lot.

239
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:29,040
We've used it for many great times.

240
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,662
I promised my wife when

241
00:18:31,888 --> 00:18:45,940
My youngest graduated last year that we would divide the lot instead of moving out of the city that we like to build a small one family home on that lot so that we don't have to leave the city.

242
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,625
And that was the reason of going forward.

243
00:18:55,627 --> 00:18:57,109
Can folks see my screen?

244
00:18:59,571 --> 00:18:59,751
Yes.

245
00:19:02,404 --> 00:19:08,345
What are the dimensions on this, Danielle?

246
00:19:11,186 --> 00:19:22,547
So this is in the, hold on a second.

247
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:26,448
Let me just confirm the zoning district.

248
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:29,349
I did check all this initially, but now I don't.

249
00:19:45,590 --> 00:20:06,664
Yeah, this is in the single family two zone and the required frontage is 35 feet.

250
00:20:07,845 --> 00:20:09,125
So it exceeds that.

251
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:11,167
It exceeds it?

252
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:17,176
Yeah, I just did a quick measure on Google Maps.

253
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:23,899
It looks like there's a little over 60 feet on the Magoon Ave side and approximately 90 feet on the Washington Street side.

254
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:34,263
Yeah, and if you can see the, I guess I can't, am I sharing the ANR plan?

255
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:38,305
So you can see, maybe it's too small, but you can see the dimensions.

256
00:20:40,178 --> 00:20:41,638
Oh yeah.

257
00:20:41,718 --> 00:20:44,659
The new lot is 102.57 feet.

258
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,640
And it's the minimum lot size.

259
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,701
And then you've got 60 on the Laguna side, so that's well over 35.

260
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:55,001
Yep.

261
00:20:55,101 --> 00:21:02,403
And so it fronts on a right of way, and in my opinion, has vital access.

262
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:12,554
So it fronts on the right of way, has vital access, and it exceeds the minimum frontage requirements.

263
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:17,195
So those are the three requirements to remind the board that an A&R needs.

264
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:27,337
So without further ado, if the board has no questions, I am going to ask for a motion to approve the A&R, although it doesn't need an approval.

265
00:21:27,977 --> 00:21:29,738
Yes, so the motion is to endorse.

266
00:21:30,118 --> 00:21:31,138
To endorse the A&R.

267
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:41,075
I second the motion.

268
00:21:43,517 --> 00:21:44,498
Do I have a second?

269
00:21:49,403 --> 00:21:49,823
I'll second.

270
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:53,767
I'm going to do a roll call.

271
00:21:53,787 --> 00:21:54,607
Sally Akiki?

272
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:56,329
Yes.

273
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,730
Peter Kautz?

274
00:21:58,431 --> 00:21:58,691
Yes.

275
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:00,173
Sabrina Alpino?

276
00:22:01,033 --> 00:22:01,274
Yes.

277
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:03,155
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

278
00:22:03,195 --> 00:22:03,636
I'm a yes.

279
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:08,150
Thank you so much, Angelo, for being here.

280
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,571
I apologize, because I blanked on your surname that quickly.

281
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:13,892
No, not a problem.

282
00:22:14,532 --> 00:22:15,933
Have a great evening.

283
00:22:15,953 --> 00:22:16,953
Thank you for being with us.

284
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:18,794
Thank you so much.

285
00:22:19,734 --> 00:22:20,234
Yes, sir.

286
00:22:21,975 --> 00:22:27,817
Our planning director will be back in the office on Monday, and she can sign the MILRs.

287
00:22:28,357 --> 00:22:30,638
So they'll be available to pick up probably on Monday.

288
00:22:30,658 --> 00:22:31,798
So just give our office a ring.

289
00:22:32,242 --> 00:22:36,564
for when they're ready, and then you can bring them down to the Registry of Deeds to have them reported.

290
00:22:37,445 --> 00:22:38,165
Thank you so much.

291
00:22:38,185 --> 00:22:39,466
You're welcome.

292
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:40,386
Thank you.

293
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:42,067
Thank you.

294
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,348
Have a good evening.

295
00:22:43,808 --> 00:22:50,272
So the third item on our agenda is approval of minutes, but they don't appear to be ready.

296
00:22:51,512 --> 00:22:56,155
Yeah, Gabe had prepared them, and I'm not sure where he put the final draft.

297
00:22:56,235 --> 00:22:56,815
I saw some

298
00:22:58,512 --> 00:23:01,495
A rough draft, and I imagine it's going to be somewhere.

299
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:05,618
And so I was like, I could redo these, but that's probably not the best use of time.

300
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,203
So next meeting.

301
00:23:12,845 --> 00:23:15,107
Next meeting will take so many minutes to approve.

302
00:23:19,532 --> 00:23:22,012
And so number four is zoning overhaul updates.

303
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:24,373
Danielle, do you have anything for us?

304
00:23:24,393 --> 00:23:36,355
I'm assuming that may wait for Alicia to return or do you have- Yeah, so we've kept that as a standing agenda item to keep you all in the loop of what's going on.

305
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:48,857
A few weeks ago, maybe it was two weeks ago, City Council had a permitting and planning subcommittee meeting and it was more of like a working session

306
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,162
And they had a bunch of maps out and a lot of questions.

307
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:55,443
And there was a lot of staff.

308
00:23:55,784 --> 00:23:57,204
And the consultants were there.

309
00:23:57,324 --> 00:24:01,847
And I think there were some members of the public and elected officials that kind of marked up the maps.

310
00:24:02,327 --> 00:24:10,672
And so they've been going through those and will be reporting back on some of those comments.

311
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:16,175
But right now, they are working on the Mystic Ave

312
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:29,828
corridor and the Salem Street corridor to put together some new dimensional and use regulations for those areas.

313
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:45,038
As we are getting a lot of interest in properties on both of those quarters and as our zoning doesn't match our comprehensive plan or revision, we really need to

314
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:51,025
get the zoning in place so that we can get the kind of development that we want.

315
00:24:52,987 --> 00:25:00,172
So that things can be just a site plan review and not coming in for a bunch of variances in order to get what we want.

316
00:25:01,353 --> 00:25:10,239
So the next city council subcommittee meeting will be next week, I believe Wednesday.

317
00:25:13,245 --> 00:25:19,611
So as always, you're welcome to attend those.

318
00:25:21,793 --> 00:25:29,300
Or they're also recorded and put on the Medford Community Media website if you ever want to catch up and see what was discussed.

319
00:25:30,481 --> 00:25:31,642
That's all I have for now.

320
00:25:35,642 --> 00:25:36,602
Thank you so much.

321
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:49,025
And just quickly to touch base, speaking on updates to zoning and so forth, Daniel, you were mentioning earlier about the housing bond bill that passed the new ADU law.

322
00:25:49,385 --> 00:25:57,266
And I'm not sure if you'll need the board to sort of help with that or if it starts in the planning office and what you'll be overruling.

323
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:05,028
I do know that KP Law, this attorney from KP Law, is actually going to do like a lunch and learn to try to figure out what the

324
00:26:05,628 --> 00:26:08,770
the law, the new law says, does, what's effective.

325
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,472
So to try to kind of put it in layman's terms for us planners.

326
00:26:13,592 --> 00:26:23,497
That would be good because we knew it was coming down the pipeline, which is OK, we're going to have to change our zoning to align with the new state law.

327
00:26:23,557 --> 00:26:26,419
But I have a lot of questions.

328
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:30,301
I don't know if this is just detached or within the same structure.

329
00:26:30,321 --> 00:26:34,523
So we're going to have to update our ordinance to

330
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,137
at a minimum, align with it.

331
00:26:37,497 --> 00:26:40,520
But we could be, I think, more permissive if we want to be.

332
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:51,090
I'm hoping, usually KP Law, which is the legal counsel that we use, usually they issue a memorandum when something changes that they send out to all their clients.

333
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,972
So I'm also hoping that we get something like that.

334
00:26:53,432 --> 00:26:57,496
But do you know if EOHLC will be

335
00:26:58,597 --> 00:27:02,061
um, issuing any like regulations or guidance for this or.

336
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:12,951
So Chris Clutchman, um, actually, uh, who's already doing the MTA laws has mentioned something about, uh, something coming down the pipeline, but I have not heard anything official.

337
00:27:13,672 --> 00:27:18,917
And now that we're two separate secretariats, I, I don't have that information real time.

338
00:27:19,197 --> 00:27:20,118
So, um,

339
00:27:20,618 --> 00:27:25,259
I'm in a separate secretariat now, but I'm assuming that that's being worked on now.

340
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:35,362
And I can get you all, I mean, you'll probably get the information as fast as I get the information, or maybe even sooner, because it's going out to municipalities as soon as possible.

341
00:27:36,442 --> 00:27:38,543
And I think it goes into effect, I think it's 180 days, I think.

342
00:27:40,708 --> 00:27:58,247
When I have not again, I have not digested even the bridge version of what was sent out by one of our not not all heroes wear capes and there is a planner out there who actually digested this information and put it into like a little compact document.

343
00:27:58,267 --> 00:27:59,669
I haven't even had a chance to read that.

344
00:28:00,269 --> 00:28:00,390
So.

345
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:03,511
All right, I didn't want to drag on on that.

346
00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:06,432
I just wanted to know if there was anything that the board was going to have to do differently.

347
00:28:06,472 --> 00:28:12,234
And if that was, I know it's going to come down the pipeline because we just approved an ADU.

348
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:15,476
And I didn't know how that was going to look going forward.

349
00:28:16,176 --> 00:28:21,338
Yeah, so that one was still, what they wanted to do is not by right.

350
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:28,301
I'm not sure if it would be by right under the new law or not.

351
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:30,682
But it's not in effect yet.

352
00:28:32,256 --> 00:28:33,457
They could have waited it out, but.

353
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:36,800
And then just are.

354
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,882
The 2nd item is how do we get these?

355
00:28:42,067 --> 00:28:44,268
to an administrative process with your office.

356
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:45,269
That's a good question.

357
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:46,450
That's a good question.

358
00:28:48,011 --> 00:28:52,953
I don't know about the rest of the board, but... That's just gonna be a waste of time.

359
00:28:53,314 --> 00:29:01,959
Yes, it's just, it's one of those things where it's like, we rely on you, you guys, to give us the information for those three requirements that we hit.

360
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:10,344
So if you know that they hit them all at that point, it's a waste of the, it's not the best use of the client's time, your time or the board's time.

361
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:16,508
It's more of, again, not trying to put more on your plate, but how do we get those quick things?

362
00:29:16,528 --> 00:29:18,189
That's a good question.

363
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:27,054
Yeah, because the two other cities that I've worked in, in Massachusetts, Somerville and Watertown, both have that as an administrative process.

364
00:29:27,094 --> 00:29:29,176
They opted out of subdivision control law.

365
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:32,558
I don't know if that's something that we can do, or I don't know.

366
00:29:33,377 --> 00:29:35,118
It does seem kind of like busy work.

367
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:44,361
I think there have been A&Rs in the past where the access question has been more subjective.

368
00:29:45,242 --> 00:29:50,844
And I think that maybe the city board has declined to endorse an A&R on tasks.

369
00:29:50,924 --> 00:29:52,584
I didn't think it met that threshold.

370
00:29:54,985 --> 00:30:01,388
But yeah, the trickier ones, I think, should be the ones coming before the board, not the ones that are

371
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,860
pretty obvious, rubber stamps.

372
00:30:06,681 --> 00:30:08,402
Yeah, rubber stamps, perfect.

373
00:30:11,762 --> 00:30:15,924
Okay, and with that, there's no other items.

374
00:30:18,404 --> 00:30:23,006
If no one wants to share anything, then I will ask for a motion to adjourn.

375
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:27,607
Okay, your turn.

376
00:30:32,318 --> 00:30:32,898
I second.

377
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:34,919
I second.

378
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,320
OK.

379
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,502
OK, Sally Akiti?

380
00:30:39,582 --> 00:30:39,842
Yes.

381
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:41,303
Peter Kaufs?

382
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:41,863
Yes.

383
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:43,184
Sabrina Alfino?

384
00:30:43,905 --> 00:30:44,205
Yes.

385
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:46,146
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

386
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:46,726
I'm a yes.

387
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:47,647
Thank you all.

388
00:30:47,687 --> 00:30:48,607
Have a great evening.

389
00:30:49,268 --> 00:30:49,748
Thank you.

390
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:50,168
Bye.

391
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:51,189
Welcome aboard, Sabrina.

392
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:52,129
They want to be the CZ.

393
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:53,350
Thank you.

394
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,711
Give you a nice short one.

395
00:30:55,991 --> 00:30:56,272
Yes.
