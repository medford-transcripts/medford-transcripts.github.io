1
00:00:08,441 --> 00:00:12,563
10th regular meeting of the Memphis City Council, March 9th, 2021.

2
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:15,105
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3
00:00:15,285 --> 00:00:15,965
Councilor Bares.

4
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:16,826
Present.

5
00:00:17,846 --> 00:00:18,627
Councilor Falco.

6
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:19,087
Present.

7
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:20,348
Vice President Knight.

8
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:20,908
Present.

9
00:00:21,328 --> 00:00:21,929
Councilor Marks.

10
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:22,689
Present.

11
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:23,550
Councilor Morrell.

12
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:24,310
Present.

13
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:25,891
Councilor Scarpelli.

14
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:26,731
Present.

15
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:41,783
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

16
00:00:47,807 --> 00:01:08,778
Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020, order suspending certain provisions of the Open Meeting Law, Chapter 30, Section 18, and the Governor's March 15, 2020, order imposing the strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place, this meeting of the Memphis City Council will be conducted by remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

17
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:11,379
Specific information and general guidelines

18
00:01:43,022 --> 00:01:44,870
think we lost the chambers for a second.

19
00:01:45,111 --> 00:01:46,557
So looks like they're trying to get it back.

20
00:02:13,648 --> 00:02:18,530
I have an announcement to make that the Council Chambers are now open to the public.

21
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,051
We do have some guests here this evening.

22
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:26,534
We have taken all the necessary guidelines given to us by the Board of Health.

23
00:02:28,375 --> 00:02:30,836
Currently, we have a capacity of 18 seats.

24
00:02:31,316 --> 00:02:33,377
They're all spaced six feet apart.

25
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:48,495
The first row, instead of being six feet from the rail, is 10 feet from the rail to give a little extra buffer to make sure that everybody is safely distanced from each other.

26
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:55,261
There are signs on the building outside, so everybody will adhere to the proper protocol.

27
00:02:55,341 --> 00:03:02,407
The messenger is logging everybody that comes into the meeting, and he will give it to the clerk so they can put it in to the computer on the next day.

28
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:12,309
So anyone who wishes to come to meetings going forward, the chamber is open for public participation or anything you want to say here.

29
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:25,072
So before we start the meeting, we have Marianne O'Connor, who's going to give us a little brief synopsis on where we are with vaccinations and general health things.

30
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:25,772
Marianne, are you here?

31
00:03:30,134 --> 00:03:30,474
I am.

32
00:03:30,995 --> 00:03:31,035
Hi.

33
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:44,471
Good evening, Council President members City Council overview of what you've been doing and where we're going with the COVID in the vaccination process.

34
00:03:45,412 --> 00:03:46,613
Sure, sure.

35
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:50,698
So give you a little update on our case numbers which are looking

36
00:03:51,205 --> 00:03:52,906
thankfully, a lot better.

37
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:58,429
In January, actually, we had over 1,000 cases, positive cases.

38
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,712
In February, that number is down to just over 300.

39
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:19,142
So we're seeing that winter surge that we had, the holiday surge certainly is coming down, which is great news, which the state also is seeing the same numbers, which is why the governor recently

40
00:04:20,064 --> 00:04:25,928
change some of the reopening plans recently as far as restaurants and capacities.

41
00:04:26,809 --> 00:04:48,764
And if these numbers continue, if the data, public health data continues to trend downward across the state, hospitalizations, there will be additional increases in capacity and some more reopening gathering limits release a little bit further, probably by the end of the month.

42
00:04:50,094 --> 00:04:57,517
I know a lot of the youth sports, the spring sports are looking for guidance and hoping, you know, for better news.

43
00:04:57,737 --> 00:04:59,918
And we're hoping that that does happen.

44
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:02,759
They did release guidance around youth sports.

45
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:11,722
I believe March 1st was the most recent, but we're gonna try to hold off before we answer any of those plans and see what we're at the end of April.

46
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:13,483
And hopefully it's even better news.

47
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:16,844
We have been,

48
00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:22,570
taking what we've been able to get from the state as far as vaccinations are concerned.

49
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:27,552
We've done probably about 11 clinics to date.

50
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:31,213
We've been able to do regionally.

51
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:32,773
We started out regionally.

52
00:05:32,793 --> 00:05:45,517
I think you all know that we were with Medford, I'm sorry, Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition Partners, which is Melrose, Wakefield, Malden, Winchester, Stoneman, Medford.

53
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:55,521
We did regional clinics and were able to regionally do 371 first responders, both first and second doses.

54
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,423
They completed their vaccination.

55
00:05:58,785 --> 00:06:00,127
We were able to do about 545

56
00:06:05,971 --> 00:06:18,042
COVID facing healthcare workers regionally, and about 122, both first and second doses for both of those congregate care, those were the first phase one people that we were able to do.

57
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:20,465
And we did those regionally.

58
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:23,448
We were able to do.

59
00:06:25,183 --> 00:06:39,892
354, 75 plus elders, Medford specific, because right after that, the state kind of cut us off basically for doses, for regional doses and stuff.

60
00:06:39,993 --> 00:06:42,774
So we're kind of on our own.

61
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:51,400
So we did 354 first doses of 75 plus, and they will be getting their second doses this Saturday at the Andrews School.

62
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:55,649
It's 354 75 plus folks.

63
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:02,695
And we're now we've been working started working with Jeff Driscoll about a month ago and planning for our housing authorities.

64
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:10,121
It's a separate program from the state, even though they've cut the locals off from basic vaccine first doses.

65
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:13,644
They do have a separate program for local housing authorities.

66
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:17,828
So Jeff and I started talking about this a while ago, and he was able to submit a plan.

67
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:27,207
And we did get those doses last week and happy to announce that today we did tampon building.

68
00:07:27,227 --> 00:07:31,090
We did 94 people at the tampon building.

69
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,274
We are doing a welding gardens tomorrow and walking court on Thursday.

70
00:07:37,294 --> 00:07:47,062
And then we got this week, we just got noticed and we received today actually another 300 doses for the salt and salt Riverside.

71
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:50,750
building, which we are planning on doing next Friday.

72
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,632
So that's all great news.

73
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:57,956
We also have been able to participate and do doses for our homebound.

74
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,198
We are continuing to add to that list.

75
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,480
We do have limited doses.

76
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:10,045
We were able to do 90 homebound residents last week.

77
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,887
The weeks of running together could have been the week before.

78
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:16,878
and they will be getting their second doses as well.

79
00:08:17,018 --> 00:08:24,301
And we believe we have about a hundred doses additionally for another a hundred homebound individuals.

80
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:32,823
So the state is just releasing their homebound plan on how we should be doing it, but we've already done it.

81
00:08:33,144 --> 00:08:35,044
So we're already well on our way.

82
00:08:35,644 --> 00:08:40,266
And we did receive the second doses for those homebound individuals as well.

83
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:42,967
But that's probably gonna be the end

84
00:08:43,948 --> 00:08:46,729
of what we have for vaccine.

85
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:59,859
Unless the floodgates open, state gets more vaccine and they allow the locals to continue to do, because right now we are not in line.

86
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:07,784
Hospitals are getting them first, pharmacies, the mass vaccination sites, obviously.

87
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:11,307
Locals are not receiving doses any longer.

88
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:22,622
Thank you very much to you and your department and all the volunteers for their hard work.

89
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:27,006
I just, you just mentioned the homebound, I think it was a homebound plan.

90
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:30,389
Can you talk a little bit more about that.

91
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,553
So, we had put aside doses originally for the homebound.

92
00:09:38,236 --> 00:09:41,919
A few weeks ago, I'm sorry, I can't, my weeks fall into each other.

93
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:54,328
I can't tell you what week is which, but so we were able to do, we partnered with Armstrong Ambulance, and I believe it was last week.

94
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:59,872
We were able to complete 90 doses for homebound individuals.

95
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:07,057
These are folks who had either called the Council on Aging, the West Bedford Community Center, or our office, whether it be their children,

96
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:09,104
are the individuals themselves.

97
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,926
These are really homebound individuals.

98
00:10:11,966 --> 00:10:14,228
These aren't people who can get out to

99
00:10:15,556 --> 00:10:18,339
vaccination sites, you know, even with assistance.

100
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:30,670
These are, these are, we're looking to target individuals who are really unable to go even out to medical appointments without assistance.

101
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:37,636
So we do, we did have a list, we do have a list from the council and people are continuing to call.

102
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:40,459
And so we are adding to that list, but we did get the first 90 done.

103
00:10:42,100 --> 00:11:06,109
and next week we are hoping with again the help of amazing volunteers to get another 60 done but we do have additional doses and we did receive the second doses so we are we're good for the whole month but again we're not getting any more so once we we reach what we have that's that's all we have.

104
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:09,310
Okay, Council Member Bucks.

105
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:10,290
Thank you.

106
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:11,844
Thank you, Mr. President.

107
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:14,325
I want to thank Marianne for being on the call tonight.

108
00:11:14,765 --> 00:11:18,488
That was extremely informative, and I appreciate the update.

109
00:11:19,728 --> 00:11:31,235
Marianne, last week we received as a council a correspondence from the mayor stating that the city was in the process of submitting an application to the state to become a vaccination site.

110
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:33,957
I was just wondering if you can update us with that.

111
00:11:34,997 --> 00:11:37,358
Yeah, we haven't heard back from the state yet.

112
00:11:37,478 --> 00:11:41,300
So we are trying to propose to be a regional vaccination site.

113
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:46,663
There are pretty strict requirements around what the state's looking for.

114
00:11:47,263 --> 00:12:03,071
We are partnering with Cambridge Health Alliance, Somerville, several other communities, Malden, Everett, Chelsea, a lot of other in Cambridge, trying to get the state to approve us as a regional vaccination site.

115
00:12:03,191 --> 00:12:04,292
If that is approved,

116
00:12:04,937 --> 00:12:14,667
The site, one of the sites we're proposing, a couple, one of the sites would be the Gansher Center in Medford at Tufts University, which would be amazing.

117
00:12:15,247 --> 00:12:16,829
So we would have it right here locally.

118
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:24,717
Unfortunately, one of the requirements, again, to fulfill, to be approved, is that you're open to the entire state.

119
00:12:25,777 --> 00:12:31,763
So it's not just a regional site like we had had originally for those five, six communities that we were with.

120
00:12:31,923 --> 00:12:35,706
It's a regional site, but it has to be open to the entire state.

121
00:12:36,187 --> 00:12:41,852
You have to be able to do at least 750 doses a day for five days within the week.

122
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:51,071
That's why the Cambridge Health Alliance has stepped up and is offering to assist with this, which would be great, but we have to be approved by the state.

123
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:55,737
It's gonna be basically considered like one of the mass vaccination sites.

124
00:12:56,417 --> 00:13:00,402
I did hear on a call from DPH today for the first time.

125
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:10,622
that if we are approved 25% of the doses would be reserved for local communities which is amazing news which is great news.

126
00:13:11,183 --> 00:13:15,168
That means our residents would be avail those 25%.

127
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:27,202
of the doses, but again, we have not, I believe there are almost 18 or more applications put into the state for these sites.

128
00:13:28,082 --> 00:13:31,445
And only one, as far as I know, has been approved so far.

129
00:13:32,226 --> 00:13:33,106
We have not heard.

130
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:34,548
We're still waiting.

131
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,291
And I'm sure you'll keep us posted if and when we do hear.

132
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:40,292
Oh, yes.

133
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:47,518
Can you give us an update on where we stand with the Method Public School faculty and teachers being vaccinated?

134
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:52,400
I would love to be able to say that we're going to do that.

135
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,102
But again, the locals are not being given the doses.

136
00:13:56,803 --> 00:14:07,630
So unfortunately, right now, the CVS pharmacies are vaccinating teachers, if you can get an appointment, because they're part of the federal pharmacy program.

137
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:12,953
And when President Biden announced that last week, that teachers were now able to do so.

138
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:16,202
CVS opened up slots for teachers.

139
00:14:16,902 --> 00:14:22,003
The state is not opening up slots for teachers until this Thursday, March 12th.

140
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:27,385
They can go on and make an appointment for March 12th and beyond, if they can get an appointment.

141
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:32,826
But right now they're being treated like the rest of the general population.

142
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,567
You have to get on the site, you have to try to get an appointment.

143
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,344
There is nothing for us slotted to be able to do our own teachers, which we would love to do.

144
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:49,967
We would love to be able to do our own teachers, but we are not being given vaccine to do so.

145
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:59,474
Right, so the Department of Education just came out with a mandate that elementary school students will be going back beginning of April.

146
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:06,939
And I'm just wondering where we stand with the vaccination for staff and teachers.

147
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:14,732
And it sounds to me that it's up to the teachers to go off and try to get their own vaccinations.

148
00:15:15,512 --> 00:15:30,321
And yeah, I'm not sure why they're not listed as a priority, not just with the city, but on the state and the federal level, especially where the requirement is that in-school learning will take place at the beginning of April.

149
00:15:30,361 --> 00:15:31,862
So that kind of troubles me.

150
00:15:33,043 --> 00:15:36,185
One other point, Mary Ann, and I'm not sure if you can answer it or not,

151
00:15:37,567 --> 00:15:46,870
We have roughly, according to my figures, about 4,500 seniors that are 75 years or older that currently reside in the city of Method.

152
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:55,472
Do we have any indication what percent of those seniors have received either their first or second vaccination?

153
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:58,410
That's hard.

154
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,071
That's hard to say.

155
00:16:00,091 --> 00:16:02,951
I think the state is looking at county wide data.

156
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:06,412
They haven't given us city community wide data.

157
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:19,596
I can't tell you who's been able to go to Danvers or Fenway or Gillette or, you know, I know about 200 of our senior residents were at the regional site that we had in Wakefield.

158
00:16:20,316 --> 00:16:21,777
I know that 354 came to our site.

159
00:16:21,977 --> 00:16:22,817
But I can't tell you

160
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:28,640
who's been able to reach you.

161
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:42,158
The good news is that now that we're doing the housing authorities, and we are reaching out to the council and aging like I said have their lists and community housing authority and the West Medford Community Center.

162
00:16:42,823 --> 00:16:50,964
And when we reach back out to these people, a lot of them have told us they've already received the vaccine, or they've already got an appointment.

163
00:16:51,564 --> 00:16:54,625
So they don't need our services right now.

164
00:16:55,165 --> 00:16:56,705
So that's good, that's good to hear.

165
00:16:56,745 --> 00:17:05,607
But I cannot, no, I have no idea who went to Gillette, who went to Fenway, who went to Danvers, or any of the mass vaccination sites.

166
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:09,027
The state has not released those numbers to us.

167
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:11,968
They're only doing it on a county-wise,

168
00:17:12,683 --> 00:17:14,364
countywide basis I believe right now.

169
00:17:15,204 --> 00:17:20,787
So how difficult Marianne would it be for us, and I realize the state's not providing these numbers.

170
00:17:21,367 --> 00:17:28,490
How difficult would it be for us as a community to look at our most vulnerable, which are our seniors, especially seniors over 75.

171
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:44,061
to reach out directly to them, if there's some 4,500, I'm sure that can be done, to see where they are in the process and to see who may need the additional help to gather an appointment, get on the internet.

172
00:17:44,582 --> 00:17:46,242
And how difficult would that be?

173
00:17:46,302 --> 00:17:47,782
Is that something that we can accomplish?

174
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:57,184
I guess, but we have tried to promote and publicize that they can call us, they can call the,

175
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:02,516
Council on Aging, they can call the West Medford Community Center.

176
00:18:03,377 --> 00:18:06,298
The Housing Authority is certainly doing all the reaching out they can.

177
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:17,701
If they need assistance, you know, to call us, because obviously this is not an easy process right if you don't have access to the internet.

178
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:19,202
First of all, you can't do it at all.

179
00:18:20,442 --> 00:18:24,543
If you don't have a child, a son or a daughter to help you, you're not going to be able to do it.

180
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:38,871
And it's just a terrible process hard process to begin with for everybody so we've asked people if they need assistance to reach out to us, and certainly we do have a lot of folks who have.

181
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:49,322
But to really scan the whole 4500, I mean, I don't know I mean we'd have to really think about that how, how would be able to accomplish that but we are getting

182
00:18:50,338 --> 00:19:01,480
We do have numbers of folks who are still in need of assistance, and I know the Council on Aging every day is helping to try to book appointments for people who can actually get to those other sites.

183
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:10,142
You know it's one thing to be able to book the appointments another thing to be able to actually get there right so we also have transportation options for folks.

184
00:19:10,902 --> 00:19:14,923
This there's a couple of different transportation options folks that we've set up so that if

185
00:19:15,698 --> 00:19:28,065
They can get an appointment but they can't literally like drive there or get there, we do have transportation options they should call the Council on Aging, or the West Benford Community Center RS, and we can hook them up with with transportation.

186
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:35,230
The Mystic Valley Elder Services is offering transportation, two round trip for both shots.

187
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:43,675
So, so there are options, and we're hoping that people get that message and they call, they reach out.

188
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:51,339
I don't think anyone behind this real doubts the work that's been done by the West Memphis Community Center or the Council on Aging or your office.

189
00:19:52,040 --> 00:20:01,784
I would just hope maybe a little more emphasis goes on outreach rather than the community reaching out to you guys, you know, especially for our most vulnerable population.

190
00:20:02,405 --> 00:20:07,607
And, you know, we took a vote, Marianne, I just want to set the record straight a few weeks back.

191
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:17,432
And I'm under the impression that maybe part of our vote wasn't accurately reflected in what this council voted on.

192
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:24,014
But we did vote unanimously to ask that you provide us with a weekly five minute update.

193
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:30,216
And there may be weeks that you don't have an update and you just come on and say, I don't have an update.

194
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:35,937
But I think would be very helpful, not just for this council, but the edification of the people that are watching

195
00:20:36,398 --> 00:20:44,022
that get a lot of their information from tuning in over the many years, especially many seniors, that that would be very helpful.

196
00:20:44,082 --> 00:20:54,147
So I would just respectfully ask if you could set aside five minutes at the beginning of our meeting every week, just to give us an update, especially during this vaccination rollout.

197
00:20:54,728 --> 00:21:04,513
And I wanna thank you and Council President Caviello for establishing this chamber to be an open, once again, an open forum

198
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:08,352
to allow residents to come up and speak in a safe fashion.

199
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:15,937
And I think you both really put together a great working plan that involves CDC regulations, Board of Health regulations.

200
00:21:16,518 --> 00:21:21,101
And I as one member, and I'm sure my colleagues can speak for themselves, are very appreciative to that fact.

201
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:24,003
And I wanna thank you both for your leadership on that.

202
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:25,363
Thank you.

203
00:21:25,383 --> 00:21:25,724
Thank you.

204
00:21:26,044 --> 00:21:27,305
And I didn't, you know,

205
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:30,567
I have never seen my name on the agenda.

206
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:33,729
So I don't want to break any open meeting laws.

207
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:36,410
So if I'm on the agenda, let me know.

208
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,131
And I will absolutely be there.

209
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:39,111
I've never been invited.

210
00:21:39,151 --> 00:21:40,312
And I haven't been on the agenda.

211
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:43,033
But certainly going forward, I would be happy to.

212
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:46,315
Well, can I personally invite you the next?

213
00:21:47,536 --> 00:21:51,038
Yeah, I think I think I formally need to be on the agenda, though.

214
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:51,758
That's all I'm saying.

215
00:21:53,827 --> 00:21:54,727
to do, right?

216
00:21:54,747 --> 00:22:00,131
I mean, she's the only way I know the worst.

217
00:22:01,632 --> 00:22:03,233
Uh, let me go, Kurt.

218
00:22:08,196 --> 00:22:09,437
If we can unmute the man, please.

219
00:22:09,657 --> 00:22:09,937
Thank you.

220
00:22:10,317 --> 00:22:11,118
Thank you, President.

221
00:22:11,958 --> 00:22:22,185
Thank you, President Kevin Carve yellow and thank you to the city councilors for allowing us to give an update and be here for the next item, hopefully, which will be the proclamation for our

222
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:25,039
Board of Health director, staff and volunteers.

223
00:22:25,699 --> 00:22:51,649
I just wanted to chime in when Councilor Marks asked about the 4,500 seniors and just to give some reassurance that when we first had the doses and we were setting up the clinic and the governor announced that we would be able to vaccinate 75 and older, the next day we scrambled, we had emergency meetings, we grabbed the help of the Medford Housing Authority, the West Medford Community Center,

224
00:22:52,263 --> 00:23:00,609
the senior center came together, and we were very concerned that we would sell out of our appointments in 30 minutes.

225
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:06,954
But I wanted to reassure you that it was open for over a week before the state took the rest of our doses.

226
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:11,737
And before they took our doses, we were able to call between my office, the Board of Health,

227
00:23:12,362 --> 00:23:26,546
our three partners, we were able to call every 75 year or older that had reached out to us and left a voicemail over the last week and get them that appointment and able to get as many people as we can appointments at the state sites as well.

228
00:23:26,626 --> 00:23:31,488
So I didn't want to just point that out that we are doing everything we can to respond to calls

229
00:23:31,901 --> 00:23:33,241
to get appointments for people.

230
00:23:33,361 --> 00:23:43,003
And we were able to have that clinic open for a full week and get everybody in that needed an appointment that was 75 plus, which went amazingly that day.

231
00:23:43,383 --> 00:23:45,763
And we look forward to giving them their second dose this weekend.

232
00:23:46,804 --> 00:23:47,664
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

233
00:23:48,164 --> 00:23:48,984
Councilor Morrell.

234
00:23:49,984 --> 00:23:50,904
Thank you, Mr. President.

235
00:23:51,184 --> 00:23:56,125
And thank you, Mary Ann, for taking the time to be here and for your ongoing and seemingly never ending work.

236
00:23:56,205 --> 00:23:57,485
I just have one question.

237
00:23:57,565 --> 00:24:00,746
So I just want to confirm to you that it's my understanding that

238
00:24:01,453 --> 00:24:17,182
When you're eligible, and as people become eligible as the steps of the phases tick on and are announced, as people become eligible, right now the best information is that when you're eligible, the best place to get your vaccine is wherever you can get an appointment.

239
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:18,203
Is that correct?

240
00:24:21,165 --> 00:24:23,526
Great, and then, oops, muted.

241
00:24:26,488 --> 00:24:27,588
There you go.

242
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,149
Yeah, so absolutely.

243
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,230
Great.

244
00:24:31,348 --> 00:24:32,089
for sure.

245
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:40,075
And then thinking to the housing authority, everyone in those buildings, those people are already being contacted.

246
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,977
That kind of rule I just said doesn't apply.

247
00:24:41,997 --> 00:24:45,720
So yeah, so it's kind of restricted.

248
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,902
It's not every building in the housing authority.

249
00:24:47,942 --> 00:24:50,203
It's the afforded elderly and affordable housing.

250
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:58,130
So there's a tampon, walk-in courts, Weldon, and Canal Street.

251
00:24:58,579 --> 00:25:02,140
that were eligible for these doses.

252
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:12,084
So if we have extra, they've asked that we reach out to the other folks who qualify in housing authority buildings.

253
00:25:12,224 --> 00:25:16,045
But at this point, those were the only units that were identified in this program.

254
00:25:17,326 --> 00:25:17,746
Okay, great.

255
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:18,426
Thank you.

256
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:21,327
That's all I have.

257
00:25:21,347 --> 00:25:21,667
Thank you.

258
00:25:21,727 --> 00:25:26,089
Along with that, Miriam, first of all, thank you and for all the volunteers for everything

259
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:29,333
is done through this pandemic.

260
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:51,834
And again, like Council Member Mox said, I know that I was, I know I'd go home and my mother would say, my wife would say, might be a little critical, but I really wanted the opportunity for the residents that wanted to come here and speak in person because it says they're for them and so I appreciate

261
00:25:52,416 --> 00:25:57,458
the work that you've done with Council President Carviello to get the chambers open.

262
00:25:57,718 --> 00:26:05,781
And so people can feel like they can be heard and share in what issues are in our community.

263
00:26:06,061 --> 00:26:07,001
And I appreciate that.

264
00:26:08,261 --> 00:26:09,462
One quick question I do have.

265
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:18,225
If we have seniors or sons or daughters of seniors that haven't

266
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,081
receive phone calls?

267
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:28,127
Should they direct calls to the mayor's office your office to get better understanding of how they can get vaccinated or if they had questions?

268
00:26:28,147 --> 00:26:44,980
So we have the resource line that I would I would point people towards because that's the best way for us to kind of figure out what the what the need is or what the question is and make it and then we can divvy it out to whoever

269
00:26:45,555 --> 00:26:50,456
can answer best so the resource line is the best way to put in a question.

270
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:55,617
Do you know that number off my head right now of course I don't.

271
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:59,178
But then the meeting.

272
00:27:00,298 --> 00:27:01,819
Yeah, I'll look for it.

273
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:08,400
And then, if they're homebound for sure that they should reach out to any of

274
00:27:09,183 --> 00:27:16,704
directly to the counseling agent, our office or anyone else, but if they're really home on individuals certainly reach out to us directly.

275
00:27:17,424 --> 00:27:18,185
Okay, thank you.

276
00:27:18,225 --> 00:27:19,725
My last question is the hypothetical.

277
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:28,026
I know we've been very adamant to making sure that our teachers were finding any way possible.

278
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:36,968
Do we have, is there a plan in case of extra dosages that we can work with either the

279
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:45,690
Armstrong or our fire department to maybe work with the school department to get teachers vaccinated.

280
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:54,357
I know that if there's a case that we might, I know you're saying that as we're calling different seniors, they're saying they're already vaccinated.

281
00:27:54,437 --> 00:28:05,987
So I don't know if we have a mechanism in place that if we do find that we have extra vaccinations that we can, you know, if there's a plan in place that we can maybe, cause that's where we can

282
00:28:06,697 --> 00:28:13,121
We have a captive audience in their schools where if they want to be vaccinated, we could bring it to them.

283
00:28:14,041 --> 00:28:17,363
Is there anything like that set up just in case as a hypothetical?

284
00:28:17,803 --> 00:28:19,404
I would love to, yeah.

285
00:28:19,604 --> 00:28:21,005
No, I would love to.

286
00:28:21,085 --> 00:28:25,027
Unfortunately, so these are state supplied vaccines.

287
00:28:25,627 --> 00:28:31,010
So we are kind of held to the restrictions as to who we can use them on.

288
00:28:32,893 --> 00:28:54,762
So right now, like again, with the affordable housing, elder and affordable housing, we've been asked if you don't, you know, if we don't fulfill those and to move on to the other housing authority locations and maybe in those family buildings that they have, they have people who are qualified, which would be, you know, 75 plus two comorbidities, 65 plus.

289
00:28:55,422 --> 00:28:58,544
I have reached out to Melrose Wakefield Hospital.

290
00:28:58,564 --> 00:29:01,785
The hospital seemed to be getting some doses recently.

291
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:13,916
And at least looking at the K through three who have to be in school by April 5 I talked to the superintendent told me that's like three to 400 teachers and staff.

292
00:29:14,696 --> 00:29:20,419
If we could even possibly get them done because they have to be in person learning full time by, you know, April 5.

293
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,242
So I did reach out to Melrose Wakefield so they have us, you know, kind of on their

294
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:33,000
Radar, if they have the doses, he got minimal doses this week and they were gone in two hours.

295
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:44,146
So, but we're on the radar for that, but certainly, yeah, we're working and all of the local boards of health are pushing DPH to allow us to do our teachers.

296
00:29:44,227 --> 00:29:48,949
So things change, you know, it could change tomorrow.

297
00:29:49,149 --> 00:29:51,991
Maybe they'll say, okay, yeah, but right now, no.

298
00:29:52,951 --> 00:29:53,992
Okay, thank you.

299
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,882
Mary Ann, I do have the resource number here that was provided.

300
00:29:56,902 --> 00:29:59,524
It's, for those who need it, it's 781-475-5644.

301
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:06,069
Again, I'll repeat it again.

302
00:30:06,089 --> 00:30:06,129
781-475-5644.

303
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:15,116
And that is the resource line for those who need some assistance.

304
00:30:16,096 --> 00:30:16,957
Thank you.

305
00:30:17,257 --> 00:30:19,699
Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight, did you want to speak?

306
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:22,361
Mr. President.

307
00:30:22,381 --> 00:30:22,481
Yes.

308
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:27,267
Okay, Councilor Bess.

309
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:29,629
Thank you, Mr. President.

310
00:30:29,749 --> 00:30:34,892
And thank you, Marianne and the entire health department, board of health staff and everybody else.

311
00:30:34,932 --> 00:30:36,673
I just had one quick question on the update.

312
00:30:37,574 --> 00:30:43,638
Has the state provided any sort of information on what the next expanded phase of vaccination might look like?

313
00:30:43,698 --> 00:30:46,700
Is that what these additional regional centers are?

314
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,682
Or is that still, are you still waiting for that last minute email?

315
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:55,225
Yeah, we'll find out after it's printed in the press.

316
00:30:55,545 --> 00:30:56,866
Yeah, no, we don't know.

317
00:30:57,687 --> 00:30:59,028
So they have the phases online.

318
00:30:59,148 --> 00:30:59,789
I shouldn't say that.

319
00:31:00,129 --> 00:31:01,330
There are the phases online.

320
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:05,153
So next would be your essential workers, right?

321
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:08,516
They did move the teachers up out of that category into their own.

322
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:14,380
But after this group would be the essential worker group in the next phase.

323
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,962
So the phases are online.

324
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:17,543
You can see who's in those groups.

325
00:31:18,987 --> 00:31:22,309
they just happen to take the teachers out of that group and push them up.

326
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:30,153
Right, yeah, and I guess I more meant like, are they talking about more locations, more vaccine, you know, that kind of thing?

327
00:31:30,393 --> 00:31:33,195
Yeah, so they're looking at these regional sites.

328
00:31:33,235 --> 00:31:44,821
They did put a thing out to folks and say, if you can meet these requirements, if you can do 750 doses a day, five days a week, you know, and stand up these locations regionally,

329
00:31:45,258 --> 00:31:51,202
But again, they're trying to do it geographically, right?

330
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:57,547
So where the places are that are hot, like the Cape just opened up theirs, right?

331
00:31:57,747 --> 00:32:06,033
So the places that don't have direct access is where they're identifying.

332
00:32:06,473 --> 00:32:12,037
Now, whether they think people in Medford can easily go to the Heinz Center or Danvers, you know,

333
00:32:14,228 --> 00:32:18,011
I don't agree with that, but I'm not the state so.

334
00:32:18,972 --> 00:32:28,460
So hopefully, we'll see, we're pushing hard because some of the communities and love actually several the communities that we've partnered with those you know high impacted communities.

335
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:31,723
So they really need access.

336
00:32:33,644 --> 00:32:34,865
So, we hope.

337
00:32:35,005 --> 00:32:35,886
Yeah.

338
00:32:36,687 --> 00:32:39,749
Thank you, Mary and I appreciate that I figured that would be the answer.

339
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,631
I'm sorry that's what you have to work with.

340
00:32:44,096 --> 00:32:48,480
Again, Marianne, thank you and thank you for all the volunteers who've been helping you on this.

341
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,643
And I want to thank you for the help that you've given me so we can get this room open to the public.

342
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:56,606
So again, I thank you for your guidance and look forward to seeing you next week.

343
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,750
Any further questions from Marianne before we move on?

344
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,471
Marianne, thank you.

345
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:03,932
Mr. President.

346
00:33:04,973 --> 00:33:05,533
Councilor Best.

347
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,436
I'd like to move to suspend the rules to take papers 21-100 and 21-181.

348
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:16,953
21-100.

349
00:33:17,253 --> 00:33:20,894
And what's the other one?

350
00:33:21,655 --> 00:33:24,155
It's the paper that Councilor Mark sent under suspension, 21-181.

351
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:24,396
Okay.

352
00:33:24,576 --> 00:33:36,340
All right, on the motion by Councilor Behrs, suspend the rule, seconded by.

353
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,640
I'm sorry?

354
00:33:45,322 --> 00:33:49,543
I will do the 100, 21-100.

355
00:33:49,603 --> 00:33:54,265
On the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by?

356
00:33:56,745 --> 00:33:57,085
Seconded.

357
00:33:58,606 --> 00:33:59,606
Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

358
00:33:59,626 --> 00:34:00,606
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

359
00:34:04,548 --> 00:34:05,108
Councilor Behrs?

360
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:05,968
Yes.

361
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:07,688
Councilor Lococo?

362
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:07,949
Yes.

363
00:34:08,269 --> 00:34:08,949
Vice President Knight?

364
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:09,029
Yes.

365
00:34:10,309 --> 00:34:10,909
Councilor Marks?

366
00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:11,370
Yes.

367
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,270
Councilor Morrell?

368
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:12,770
Yes.

369
00:34:13,668 --> 00:34:14,409
Councilor Scarpelli?

370
00:34:14,529 --> 00:34:14,809
Yes.

371
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:15,770
President Caravagno?

372
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,331
Yes, I'm in favor of rules are suspended.

373
00:34:20,073 --> 00:34:22,434
Communications from the Mayor, 2-1-0-0-0.

374
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:36,545
To the Honorable President and members of the Memphis City Council, City Hall, Memphis Mass, dear Mr. President and City Council, I am pleased to put forward this proclamation, proclamation of gratitude

375
00:34:37,394 --> 00:34:47,743
to the staff and volunteers of the Method Board of Health in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic in recognition of the work of the Method Board of Health, Director Marion O'Connor, staff, and volunteers.

376
00:34:48,023 --> 00:34:52,647
I welcome the council to join me in adopting this proclamation as well.

377
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,909
Sincerely, Mayor Brenna Longo-Curran.

378
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,270
Madam Mayor.

379
00:34:58,812 --> 00:35:00,134
Thank you, President Caravaglio.

380
00:35:01,635 --> 00:35:02,796
I appreciate the time.

381
00:35:02,856 --> 00:35:05,098
I want to point out that we have

382
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:14,439
I think all of our Board of Health staff on the call, Sophie, Rose, Brooke, Sarah, Melanie, Penny, Wendy, I see you all there.

383
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:16,600
I also see a number of our volunteers.

384
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,002
Patty Costas is here, Pat Hanson's here.

385
00:35:21,182 --> 00:35:26,404
So I'm sure I'm missing some, but I just want to point out that not only are we here for all of you tonight,

386
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:34,590
You're all here also to support Marion O'Connor, our board of health director and all the work that she has done with obviously the help of you.

387
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,711
So you've got us through the last year and this is for you.

388
00:35:37,731 --> 00:35:44,533
And I appreciate the council signing onto this proclamation that we will hang proudly at Medford City Hall for all to see.

389
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:53,876
So if I may, this is a proclamation of gratitude to the staff and volunteers of the Medford Board of Health in response to the COVID-19 global pandemic.

390
00:35:54,837 --> 00:36:03,304
Whereas the city of Medford along with the nation and the entire world has faced the effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic since the beginning of 2020.

391
00:36:03,824 --> 00:36:13,572
And whereas the virus has affected the lives of every single person in the city of Medford and has claimed the lives of over 500,000 people in the United States.

392
00:36:14,813 --> 00:36:20,938
And whereas the Medford Board of Health in response to this unprecedented public health and humanitarian crisis

393
00:36:21,725 --> 00:36:29,251
immediately and boldly took steps to protect public health, deliver aid, and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in our community.

394
00:36:30,672 --> 00:36:48,325
And whereas more than 120 residents in both medical and non-medical fields have consistently volunteered time and efforts to the city's model R U OK program to provide food, medication, supplies, phone calls, vaccinations, and comfort to Medford residents.

395
00:36:49,485 --> 00:36:51,347
And whereas together with the R U OK

396
00:36:52,063 --> 00:37:15,965
volunteers and Medical Reserve Corps volunteers, the Board of Health has been able to provide critical aid and support to the Medford community within the past year, including more than 10,000 initial calls made to seniors with 2,500 additional calls for follow-up, more than 2,500 deliveries of meals, medication and supplies, contact tracing for nearly 5,000 local cases of COVID-19,

397
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:39,420
including daily case counts as high as 105, created Medford's first multilingual language resource line to connect residents with resources and services related to food security, housing, mental and behavioral assistance, and other related needs, and nearly 2,000 calls received in just over two months.

398
00:37:41,021 --> 00:37:44,022
And whereas in collaboration with administrators, staff,

399
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:57,790
and health workers at Medford public schools, coordinated and provided support for over 20,000 individual and pooled COVID-19 tests in Medford schools, allowing children to return to in-person learning safely and securely.

400
00:37:58,931 --> 00:38:13,862
And whereas despite limitations and supply from the Commonwealth, coordinated the direct vaccination of nearly 2000 people thus far in the city of Medford, including residents 75 and older during clinics and directly in homes for those unable to travel,

401
00:38:15,051 --> 00:38:29,057
And whereas working with the Medford Council on Aging, Medford Housing Authority, and West Medford Community Center directly assisted more than 500 Medford seniors with making vaccine appointments, registration, and transportation to state-sponsored vaccine sites.

402
00:38:30,257 --> 00:38:44,243
And whereas the Medford Board of Health, through Director Mary Ann O'Connor, the dedicated staff, and countless volunteers, has, from the onset of the virus one year ago, performed above and beyond the call of duty

403
00:38:44,714 --> 00:38:58,206
for the benefit of the public health of the residents of the city of Medford, regardless of language spoken, economic situation, race, gender, immigration status, ability, benefit eligibility or religious affiliation.

404
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:12,378
Now, therefore, I as mayor of the city of Medford do hereby proclaim with profound gratitude to those who have worked tirelessly to protect public health and in remembrance of those we have lost

405
00:39:13,013 --> 00:39:27,788
that the city of Medford extends its deepest thanks and appreciation to the Medford Board of Health Director, Marianne O'Connor, the staff and volunteers of the Medford Board of Health for their work in the past year and on behalf of the people of Medford.

406
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:29,750
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

407
00:39:30,837 --> 00:39:32,158
Thank you, President Carviello.

408
00:39:32,198 --> 00:39:35,400
And if I just may, it's been a really tough year for the community.

409
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:41,525
It's been a tough year for our volunteers, our staff, and our director, but they have come together.

410
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:49,531
They are a family, we are all a family, and we have been able to conquer the challenges that have come before us.

411
00:39:49,671 --> 00:39:54,495
And thank you to the city council for your support, and the school committee, and the school administration.

412
00:39:54,855 --> 00:39:57,637
Together we've been able to get through it, and we have hope now.

413
00:39:58,123 --> 00:39:59,584
We are vaccinating people.

414
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:00,585
It's a wonderful thing.

415
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:02,286
And we're gonna continue to do the work.

416
00:40:03,007 --> 00:40:03,707
And I thank you.

417
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:06,669
I know Mirian O'Connor's family's here too.

418
00:40:07,370 --> 00:40:09,972
Everybody just so proud of the work that you all have done.

419
00:40:09,992 --> 00:40:12,294
And thank you from the bottom of my heart as mayor.

420
00:40:12,454 --> 00:40:16,016
And I'm sure the city council feels the same.

421
00:40:16,036 --> 00:40:16,797
Thank you.

422
00:40:17,517 --> 00:40:18,198
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

423
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:19,199
Councilor Best.

424
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:21,140
Thank you, Mr. President.

425
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,963
And thank you to Mirian and everyone

426
00:40:25,805 --> 00:40:28,926
at the Board of Health and Health Department and all of the volunteers.

427
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:41,369
And just reading through that list, I think it's important that we do it, not just to acknowledge everything you've done, but to, it got me a little choked up just thinking about how far we've come together through all of this.

428
00:40:43,229 --> 00:40:48,050
And it's been so hard and so many last minute changes and so much loss.

429
00:40:49,711 --> 00:40:54,572
But I also think we've gained a lot of community through this as best as we could and helped so many people.

430
00:40:56,137 --> 00:40:56,898
I just want to thank you.

431
00:40:58,959 --> 00:41:00,020
Thank you, Councilor Beza.

432
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:00,600
Councilor Morrell.

433
00:41:01,561 --> 00:41:02,422
Thank you, Mr. President.

434
00:41:02,442 --> 00:41:05,284
Yeah, I thank the mayor for introducing this.

435
00:41:05,404 --> 00:41:07,646
It's very much needed.

436
00:41:07,906 --> 00:41:22,357
And I read something this past weekend that was startling, but I guess not too surprising at this point, in that one in three people has lost someone to COVID, someone in their lives to COVID, and more than half of those people who have died in the U.S.

437
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:23,578
have passed since November.

438
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:42,629
And I say this to just note the incredible impact and the long haul of this, something that's been felt acutely by those working diligently in community health, supporting Medford residents through loss of their loved ones, loss of jobs, loss of incomes, loss of normalcy and stability.

439
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:53,355
And this past year has been an incredible weight to bear for all of us, but really no one has shouldered the burden quite like our community centers or volunteers or public health workers

440
00:41:54,126 --> 00:41:55,267
that are on the call tonight.

441
00:41:55,467 --> 00:42:07,411
And these staff and these volunteers have given endlessly of themselves at a time when we're all facing collective trauma, grief, and loss, and sometimes makes us act in ways that doesn't make their jobs any easier.

442
00:42:07,511 --> 00:42:21,377
So again, I thank the mayor for introducing this proclamation to commend and honor the work of such an important group of people, really led fearlessly by Marian O'Connor, who has had no shortage of difficult and light speed decisions to make under a microscope.

443
00:42:21,942 --> 00:42:23,782
And I don't think I can commend her enough for that work.

444
00:42:23,862 --> 00:42:26,043
And I think the whole community is so appreciative of that work.

445
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:33,764
So I wholly support this, and I'm really honored to have these individuals in our community and working for our community.

446
00:42:35,565 --> 00:42:35,925
Thank you.

447
00:42:35,985 --> 00:42:36,865
Councilor Belco.

448
00:42:38,425 --> 00:42:39,646
Thank you, President Cabrillo.

449
00:42:39,686 --> 00:42:45,827
I also want to thank Mary Ann O'Connor and her staff and all the volunteers for their hard work.

450
00:42:48,134 --> 00:42:54,218
And I thank the mayor for bringing this forward, and I thank Consular Marks because I know he has a resolution as well that he's bringing forward.

451
00:42:54,879 --> 00:43:03,005
And I cannot thank everyone enough, especially, like you said, Marianne, the staff members, the volunteers, and, you know,

452
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,591
There were so many people that volunteered this effort.

453
00:43:05,611 --> 00:43:07,432
And this has been a really, really tough year.

454
00:43:08,192 --> 00:43:11,814
And so many people sacrificing their own health to help others.

455
00:43:12,595 --> 00:43:18,338
And it was nice to see the community come together and still come together to help during these very, very tough times.

456
00:43:18,878 --> 00:43:20,919
So I want to say thank you for all your hard work.

457
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:27,843
Thank you, Marianne, personally, for taking the many phone calls I made to you over the past year about COVID.

458
00:43:28,543 --> 00:43:31,005
And thank you so much for your help.

459
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:32,786
And I can't thank you enough.

460
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:33,146
Thank you.

461
00:43:34,242 --> 00:43:34,782
Councilor Mox.

462
00:43:35,562 --> 00:43:44,146
Mr. President, at this time, I would ask, because the council made a statement as well, I would ask that that statement be read as well, Mr. President.

463
00:43:48,947 --> 00:43:53,269
Okay.

464
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:01,632
We have a statement here offered by Councilor Mox on the suspension of the Memphis City Council

465
00:44:02,095 --> 00:44:13,944
is honored to offer this council accommodation, a council accommodation of extreme appreciation and profound gratitude to the Memphis community who is working tirelessly to protect the health and safety of fellow residents.

466
00:44:14,384 --> 00:44:25,552
Therefore, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council acknowledge the many workers, residents, and businesses who are stepping up above and beyond to provide critical assistance and compassion during these trying times.

467
00:44:25,592 --> 00:44:26,192
Councilor Marks.

468
00:44:27,213 --> 00:44:28,234
Thank you, Mr. President.

469
00:44:28,314 --> 00:44:29,715
And I thought this was very fitting

470
00:44:30,756 --> 00:44:32,517
to bring up, Mr. President.

471
00:44:33,217 --> 00:44:37,238
The mayor, in her capacity, has the ability to put out proclamations.

472
00:44:37,718 --> 00:44:40,479
The council has the ability to put out commendations.

473
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:57,344
And Mr. President, this is truly a thank you to all those in the community that have participated over the past year in ensuring that we fight this horrible COVID-19 as one, Mr. President.

474
00:44:57,784 --> 00:44:59,925
And I think what you saw over the past year is

475
00:45:00,415 --> 00:45:02,957
a community unite over a common cause.

476
00:45:03,637 --> 00:45:22,369
And it involves many people in this community, as which we just heard the Board of Health and the many volunteers over the past year have worked tirelessly to make sure that our most vulnerable population served in a time of need, Mr. President.

477
00:45:22,749 --> 00:45:24,370
And that does not go unnoticed.

478
00:45:25,131 --> 00:45:29,013
So on behalf of the council, I'm sure my council colleagues will speak

479
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:34,013
I'd like to personally thank Mary Ann and the Board of Health, as well as the volunteers.

480
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:55,707
I also would like to take a moment, Mr. President, for someone that is in stop and shop at least two days a week and have seen the, what I call, frontline workers that have been there since day one, Mr. President, making sure that we have food, Mr. President, making sure that our stores remain open

481
00:45:56,617 --> 00:46:01,998
These two also are the unsung heroes that we don't hear about, Mr. President.

482
00:46:02,478 --> 00:46:03,318
Meal carriers.

483
00:46:04,298 --> 00:46:07,259
They haven't missed a beat, Mr. President, in the past year.

484
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:15,220
Healthcare workers who have been dealing with the sick and infirm, Mr. President, during these tough, difficult times.

485
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:25,222
First responders, police, fire, and EMS within our community have done yeoman's work, Mr. President, in answering the calls over the past year

486
00:46:25,988 --> 00:46:37,578
and have not received much praise, Mr. President, but I think this council accommodation is thanking them after a year of their due diligence, Mr. President.

487
00:46:38,299 --> 00:46:43,964
School employees, teachers that have been on the front lines, Mr. President, as well.

488
00:46:44,204 --> 00:46:45,545
I mentioned grocery workers,

489
00:46:46,043 --> 00:46:56,487
bankers, Mr. President, retail employees, truckers, delivery people that have been delivering in our neighborhoods into the most needy, into shut-ins in the community.

490
00:46:57,268 --> 00:47:03,110
Military personnel, Mr. President, that have been there to protect us during this awful virus.

491
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:05,811
Sanitary workers, restaurant workers.

492
00:47:05,851 --> 00:47:09,433
We have a gentleman here tonight, Mr. President, that owns a restaurant.

493
00:47:09,855 --> 00:47:21,569
And many of these restaurant workers during this tough time were there to make sure that they stayed open, even though business was tough and, you know, you weren't allowed to have people in your restaurant.

494
00:47:21,849 --> 00:47:29,098
They stayed open for takeout and assisted residents, Mr. President, during this tough fiscal time and tough times.

495
00:47:30,158 --> 00:47:33,019
You know, that doesn't go unnoticed, Mr. President.

496
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:44,942
We have nonprofit workers that have been out in the streets assisting families, homeless families, people that are being discarded, Mr. President, tenants and so forth.

497
00:47:46,022 --> 00:47:48,363
That has been a huge issue, Mr. President.

498
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:52,144
The building and trades, they haven't gone down, Mr. President.

499
00:47:52,384 --> 00:47:53,444
They're up and functioning.

500
00:47:53,764 --> 00:47:56,585
Civil service employees, Mr. President,

501
00:47:56,978 --> 00:48:06,404
And every other Method resident that reached out to their neighbor or a loved one and asked them if they needed help, if they needed assistance, do they need someone to shovel?

502
00:48:06,644 --> 00:48:10,067
Do they need someone to go to the store and pick up their laundry?

503
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,628
Or do they need someone to help get some food?

504
00:48:13,149 --> 00:48:16,931
And these are the unsung heroes, Mr. President, in our community.

505
00:48:17,491 --> 00:48:21,474
And on behalf of the council, I'm sure my council colleagues are gonna speak on this.

506
00:48:22,194 --> 00:48:23,015
We wanna thank them.

507
00:48:23,708 --> 00:48:33,252
on behalf of the mayor's proclamation, and also the council's accommodation, thanking everyone in our community for pitching in during this very difficult time.

508
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:34,533
Thank you, Council Member.

509
00:48:34,553 --> 00:48:35,433
Council Member Schiaffelli.

510
00:48:35,773 --> 00:48:49,399
So again, thank you, Marianne and your staff for providing the leadership that we needed in probably the most difficult time this community has ever seen.

511
00:48:49,479 --> 00:48:50,279
So I also

512
00:48:51,475 --> 00:48:52,936
to follow along with Council Marks.

513
00:48:52,956 --> 00:49:19,975
He said it all, but I think that what I saw during this pandemic is sense of community and the few things that Council Marks mentioned that really impressed me is the seniors, our neighbors that are seniors, when you'd watch neighbors walk next door because they were going to the supermarket and ask them if they needed for them to pick something up just because they didn't want them to be exposed, whether it's

514
00:49:20,446 --> 00:49:47,475
Halloween and making sure our neighborhood kids can have a safe and happy time and make sure that we did give them an opportunity to celebrate Halloween, but in a safe manner, whether it's, you know, teachers and, you know, I'm lucky to have my sister as a reading teacher, just listen to her stories and, you know, watch her cry at times because of the frustration at the beginning and what teachers are going through.

515
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:49,056
It's been so,

516
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:55,581
It's been so eye-opening when you look at tragedies, how communities band together.

517
00:49:55,621 --> 00:50:14,705
And one thing that I'm very proud of is that one thing we did see is Council Marks, everybody that he mentioned, the leadership team with the Board of Health and Mary Ann, and our fire and police, and they didn't take a day off.

518
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:17,265
Our firemen and police, men and women,

519
00:50:17,898 --> 00:50:31,460
and five men and women were first ones through a door and hearing the stories, how they had to wrap up to make sure they were keeping themselves safe and their co-workers safe is just commendable.

520
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:39,842
So we're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, but we see contentious issues in our community today.

521
00:50:40,542 --> 00:50:45,383
And I don't want our community to bypass

522
00:50:46,373 --> 00:50:52,317
how great Medford is and how they acted and how they continue to act and making sure they're protecting each other.

523
00:50:52,337 --> 00:50:54,678
You know, something simple as wearing a mask.

524
00:50:54,738 --> 00:51:00,922
I'll be honest with you, in my travels, I didn't see too many people in the city of Medford not wearing a mask.

525
00:51:01,362 --> 00:51:06,986
And something that simple meant so much for our safety and for each other's safety and health and well-being.

526
00:51:07,046 --> 00:51:10,928
So again, I appreciate the mayor bringing this forward.

527
00:51:10,948 --> 00:51:15,351
I appreciate Councilor Marks bringing his accommodation forward and

528
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,301
And this is, like I said, as we get to the end, we pray for the people that we lost.

529
00:51:21,381 --> 00:51:30,062
We never forget their struggle that they've gone through, but at the same time, we celebrate how our communities stood together and we're getting through this.

530
00:51:30,102 --> 00:51:30,903
So thank you.

531
00:51:31,283 --> 00:51:31,623
Thank you.

532
00:51:32,003 --> 00:51:34,463
And again, thank you everyone.

533
00:51:34,563 --> 00:51:40,164
Again, I think Councilor Marks and Councilor Caput took in pretty much everybody in the city here.

534
00:51:40,204 --> 00:51:42,865
So I don't think we have anybody else to thank here.

535
00:51:45,388 --> 00:51:50,249
We have a motion on the floor to join papers 21000 and 21181.

536
00:51:50,509 --> 00:51:55,930
Motion, Mr. President.

537
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,651
The motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by.

538
00:51:58,571 --> 00:51:59,731
Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

539
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:02,111
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to join these two papers.

540
00:52:06,212 --> 00:52:06,832
Councilor Behrs.

541
00:52:07,453 --> 00:52:07,753
Yes.

542
00:52:09,013 --> 00:52:09,713
Councilor Falcone.

543
00:52:09,813 --> 00:52:10,033
Yes.

544
00:52:10,713 --> 00:52:11,433
Vice President Knight.

545
00:52:11,453 --> 00:52:11,973
Yes.

546
00:52:12,454 --> 00:52:13,054
Councilor Marks.

547
00:52:13,314 --> 00:52:13,614
Yes.

548
00:52:15,075 --> 00:52:15,295
Yes.

549
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:16,917
Councilor Scarpelli.

550
00:52:17,197 --> 00:52:17,437
Yes.

551
00:52:17,757 --> 00:52:18,518
President Kerrio.

552
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:18,798
Yes.

553
00:52:18,878 --> 00:52:20,820
I'm in the affirmative motion passes the joint vote.

554
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,301
Mr. President, while we're on suspension.

555
00:52:22,981 --> 00:52:23,562
Mr. President.

556
00:52:24,022 --> 00:52:26,124
While we're on suspension, Councilor Marks.

557
00:52:26,464 --> 00:52:27,005
I'm sorry.

558
00:52:27,085 --> 00:52:31,528
We have to vote on the original, on the paper.

559
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:32,629
Mr. President.

560
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,233
We can take a vote on the paper, but while we're on the suspension after, I'd like to offer another item.

561
00:52:38,554 --> 00:52:40,536
Mr. Clerk, we call the vote on the actual paper.

562
00:52:41,236 --> 00:52:41,857
Mr. President.

563
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:44,291
Thank you.

564
00:52:44,371 --> 00:52:50,176
Just before we vote on the paper, I got a little choked up earlier and I just again wanted to thank everybody.

565
00:52:50,196 --> 00:52:56,602
And also, you know, my sister's a frontline worker and I think she's very much appreciated all the health guidelines that have gone out.

566
00:52:56,642 --> 00:53:05,589
She works at a bank down in Haines Square and, you know, she's been very grateful that people are wearing masks and the health guidelines are being followed.

567
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:07,611
And, you know, if there's ever an issue, they know who to call.

568
00:53:07,631 --> 00:53:11,274
So I just wanted to link those two issues together and just also say,

569
00:53:11,853 --> 00:53:14,995
you know, there's a few months ahead of us, still difficult few months.

570
00:53:15,075 --> 00:53:29,685
And I think all the work that we've done as a whole community or the whole list of people, everyone in Medford who has stepped up and followed the guidance and leadership of our board of health, you know, we got to see this through, we got to stick it out and you know, all this work can't be for naught.

571
00:53:29,805 --> 00:53:37,270
So hopefully fingers crossed, we're a few months away from everybody being vaccinated and thinking about a new normal.

572
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:40,212
And I just implore everybody

573
00:53:40,948 --> 00:53:45,870
Let's keep going and make sure that we can actually see the other end of this tunnel.

574
00:53:46,151 --> 00:53:46,511
Thank you.

575
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:50,073
The motion by Councilor Mark, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

576
00:53:50,113 --> 00:53:51,313
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

577
00:53:51,793 --> 00:53:52,354

Yes.

581
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:57,656
Vice President Knight.

582
00:53:57,816 --> 00:53:58,117
Yes.

583
00:53:58,317 --> 00:53:58,917
Councilor Marks.

584
00:53:59,077 --> 00:53:59,377
Yes.

585

Yes.

589
00:54:03,179 --> 00:54:04,000
President Caravaglia.

590
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:04,220
Yes.

591
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,061
Assembly affirmative, motion passes.

592
00:54:06,141 --> 00:54:07,461
Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight.

593
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:28,451
21-098 petition for calling a picture license by Michael Lewis seven heaven drive on the day, New Hampshire for cafe services or the cafe one cabinet road method mass.

594
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:29,812
Mr. Lewis, are you on the call?

595
00:54:35,857 --> 00:54:36,137
I am.

596
00:54:39,828 --> 00:54:43,989
The chair recognizes the Chairman of the Licensing Council, Scott Belli.

597
00:54:44,049 --> 00:54:44,910
Thank you, Mr. President.

598
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:49,611
Thank you, Mr. Lewis, for presenting your business here in Medford.

599
00:54:50,631 --> 00:54:54,072
I see everything that you have passed everything in.

600
00:54:54,112 --> 00:54:55,153
Everything looks in order.

601
00:54:56,653 --> 00:55:05,916
If you can, if you could just, before our councilors ask some questions, can you give us a little synopsis of what we're doing in your business?

602
00:55:07,014 --> 00:55:09,356
Cafe Services, a contract management company.

603
00:55:10,097 --> 00:55:14,842
In Medford, we were operating a corporate cafe for the Davis companies of One Cabot Road.

604
00:55:15,783 --> 00:55:21,689
The company that was in there, Simpsons Corp, went out of business, so we took it over for them.

605
00:55:24,797 --> 00:55:37,807
But we do corporate cafes, we do K-12 school districts in Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Connecticut, and we do senior dining in all of the six New England states.

606
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:44,313
Okay, so do you have an actual cafe, or is this just in bulk that we just do?

607
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:53,460
No, it's a cafe where we have actually just one person there because of the population in the building.

608
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:55,851
Okay, so thank you.

609
00:55:56,011 --> 00:55:58,232
I do see everything in order, so I move approval.

610
00:55:58,272 --> 00:56:00,133
I know my fellow colleagues may have questions.

611
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:02,974
Thank you.

612
00:56:03,154 --> 00:56:06,476

613
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,257
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:56:09,558 --> 00:56:10,138

00:56:11,058 --> 00:56:11,439
Yes.

616
00:56:11,459 --> 00:56:13,279
Councilor Keohokalole.

617
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:13,640
Yes.

618
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,120
Vice President Knight.

619
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:15,260
Yes.

620
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,001
Councilor Leopold.

621
00:56:16,221 --> 00:56:16,541
Yes.

622
00:56:16,561 --> 00:56:19,843

623
00:56:19,923 --> 00:56:20,123
Yes.

624
00:56:21,365 --> 00:56:22,985
Yes, 17 affirmative motion passes.

625
00:56:23,025 --> 00:56:24,606
Good luck Mr. Lewis on your cafe.

626
00:56:24,906 --> 00:56:26,366
Thank you very much for your time.

627
00:56:28,127 --> 00:56:29,147
Thank you.

628
00:56:29,547 --> 00:56:30,347
Councilor Marks.

629
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:35,269
Mr. President, while we're under suspension, I would ask that we take public participation.

630
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:44,031
We have a distinguished gentleman in the audience that served almost four decades in the public service here in the community that would like to speak.

631
00:56:45,391 --> 00:56:48,252
Yes, on the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by.

632
00:56:48,452 --> 00:56:48,712
Second.

633
00:56:49,257 --> 00:56:51,837
By Councilor, Vice President Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

634
00:56:56,858 --> 00:56:57,458
Councilor Behrs.

635
00:56:58,239 --> 00:56:58,519
Yes.

636
00:56:59,859 --> 00:57:00,479
Councilor Falco.

637
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:00,779
Yes.

638
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:01,719
Vice President Knight.

639
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:03,640
Councilor Marks.

640
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:04,100
Yes.

641
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,040
Councilor Morrell.

642
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:05,680
Yes.

643
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,220
Councilor Scarpelli.

644
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:07,540
Yes.

645
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:08,500
President Kerrio.

646
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,061
Yes, seven in favor of the motion passes.

647
00:57:10,101 --> 00:57:13,541
Public participation petition to the Honorable City Council.

648
00:57:14,962 --> 00:57:16,162
Citizens participation.

649
00:57:17,937 --> 00:57:24,899
offered by Robert M. Penta that the issue of water and sewer base be charged since 2017 be discussed.

650
00:57:26,259 --> 00:57:27,760
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

651
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,100
My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road.

652
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:31,901
I don't know if you can hear me.

653
00:57:32,061 --> 00:57:33,201
We'd appreciate it if you don't touch that.

654
00:57:33,481 --> 00:57:35,442
No, can you hear it?

655
00:57:35,562 --> 00:57:36,922
Can you hear me?

656
00:57:36,982 --> 00:57:37,923
Yes, we can hear you.

657
00:57:38,763 --> 00:57:46,725
Back in May of 2017, what was presented here before the city of Method was a new, what they call a base,

658
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:50,539
rate of 861 per household.

659
00:57:50,979 --> 00:57:58,002
And then the different charge would be for the commercial district folks here in the city of Medford.

660
00:57:58,622 --> 00:58:03,364
And then one of the arguments was that it would raise $1 million a year.

661
00:58:03,384 --> 00:58:10,786
That was approximately 4% of what the city's budget was at that point in time required for the water and sewer services in the city of Medford.

662
00:58:11,807 --> 00:58:15,268
Subsequent to that, it's gone on for the last three years.

663
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,881
now coming into its fourth fiscal year.

664
00:58:18,821 --> 00:58:32,945
And I believe a response that was sent back to the city, you folks, pursuant to a request from one of your colleagues, was a breakdown of how much money each and every one of the last three fiscal years amounted to.

665
00:58:33,945 --> 00:58:43,128
Inclusive of that amount, again, was the term of $1 million to be used per year, but they never reached the $1 million per year.

666
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:57,951
What was reached was $2,585,362.66 as compared to the $3 million that was allegedly stated that the city would gain.

667
00:58:58,411 --> 00:58:59,351
That's a difference of $414,637.

668
00:58:59,612 --> 00:59:04,274
So where do we go with that?

669
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:14,140
Where we go with that, the argument was that that would be used to supplement water and sewer for whatever needs might be if something were to come up

670
00:59:14,937 --> 00:59:20,601
also to subsidize the water and sewer department in case of something that's anticipated.

671
00:59:21,501 --> 00:59:33,749
In the letter that came back, it indicated here that the universal connectivity fee is an infrastructure recovery charge to be hooked into and maintained in the water and sewer system.

672
00:59:34,349 --> 00:59:43,475
The fixed base connectivity fee is estimated at $1 million per year to help stabilize revenues in this place.

673
00:59:44,439 --> 00:59:49,161
That response also indicated that that money goes to your water and sewer account.

674
00:59:50,161 --> 00:59:51,502
There is no breakdown.

675
00:59:52,182 --> 00:59:56,504
There is no breakdown to the charges, commercial or residential.

676
00:59:57,084 --> 01:00:01,566
There is no breakdown also as to how and where that money has been spent.

677
01:00:02,127 --> 01:00:07,729
And there is no program that is set up presently that tells you what that money can be used for.

678
01:00:08,149 --> 01:00:12,011
So right now, all it's done has been included into your water and sewer account.

679
01:00:12,957 --> 01:00:25,164
One of the misnomers to this whole project, when sold back in 2017, was in case there is a, in case, that's the word, in case there is a deficit in either the water or sewer account.

680
01:00:25,904 --> 01:00:31,287
In the years 2016 and 17, there were deficits on the sewer side, not the water side.

681
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:40,292
But each and every year, when the water and sewer budget is estimated, it's estimated on what the work is going to be here in the city of Method, and also,

682
01:00:40,852 --> 01:00:48,336
The water and the sewer rates that you get from the MWRA, those rates come in ahead of time, not after a budget is made and set.

683
01:00:48,896 --> 01:00:51,458
That's another misnomer as it relates to the full program.

684
01:00:52,118 --> 01:01:10,148
So approximately right now, you're sitting on $2,585,000 of base rate fees or charges, whatever the term you want to use, that has come from the Mr. and Mrs. Metro taxpayer has been put into the general revenues of your water and sewer account.

685
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:20,684
That ladies and gentlemen is not the proper accounting practices and procedures because in your own water and sewer account, you have to have it broken down.

686
01:01:21,064 --> 01:01:22,845
You have it broken down by employees.

687
01:01:23,185 --> 01:01:25,266
You have it broken down by cost of material.

688
01:01:25,586 --> 01:01:30,268
You have it broken down by the named individuals in the trucks and everything else that goes along with it.

689
01:01:31,309 --> 01:01:33,950
My suggestion to you folks would be simply this.

690
01:01:35,231 --> 01:01:38,132
You can't put a fee on somebody or a charge

691
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:41,288
without knowing what you're charging them for.

692
01:01:42,228 --> 01:01:42,988
It's not fair.

693
01:01:43,429 --> 01:01:50,071
If that's the case, you should have just raised the water and sewer account by the approximate 4% that you think it was going to do to offset it.

694
01:01:51,031 --> 01:02:06,517
So if you're sitting on a surplus of approximately $7 million or thereabouts in your water and sewer enterprise account, and you're sitting on approximately having already raised $2.5 million, but you still don't know how it was spent, where it was gonna go,

695
01:02:07,116 --> 01:02:09,377
Where is the projected projects that are supposed to come?

696
01:02:10,238 --> 01:02:15,361
It doesn't make any sense because right now, what it's saying is it's a water and sewage charge.

697
01:02:15,881 --> 01:02:19,903
It was to services in case something were to happen.

698
01:02:20,984 --> 01:02:26,287
The original proposal back in 2017 was the charge for the water meeting.

699
01:02:26,607 --> 01:02:30,289
And that was the charge that was going to be placed on each and every residential person.

700
01:02:31,270 --> 01:02:35,392
So we know right now that that charge every single time, once it comes out,

701
01:02:36,162 --> 01:02:37,122
is not for the meter.

702
01:02:37,642 --> 01:02:48,725
But unfortunately, for accounting purposes, because you can't figure it out, in this city, in the accounting department, there is nothing to be found that'll tell you how and where that money was spent.

703
01:02:49,145 --> 01:02:53,586
But you can find it in water and sewer, in their particular budgets, independently separated.

704
01:02:54,806 --> 01:02:58,487
My suggestion would be to you, that you have a budget coming up this year.

705
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:04,088
I would hope that maybe somebody would make a request and ask the question, because it doesn't make any sense

706
01:03:04,759 --> 01:03:09,281
that the response that came back from the finance director, we don't keep an accounting.

707
01:03:09,882 --> 01:03:18,887
Well, if you don't keep an accounting, how do you keep an accounting of residential and commercial meters that you have and what you're going to be charged?

708
01:03:19,367 --> 01:03:24,270
How can you allege that you're going to be taking in a million dollars a year when you haven't even got to that figure?

709
01:03:26,171 --> 01:03:30,773
Something needs to be said as it relates to these type of budgetary items.

710
01:03:30,813 --> 01:03:34,035
Seven weeks ago, I came in here and I think I explained something like seven items.

711
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:37,712
I'm going to go through them all one at a time, not tonight, Mr. President.

712
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:39,653
I will go through them all one at a time.

713
01:03:40,374 --> 01:03:46,638
Because good accounting procedures tells you what comes in has got to go out and how does it go out.

714
01:03:47,579 --> 01:03:57,645
You've got situations here that you really don't know why should you be charging these people to supplement or augment a water and sewer account that's presently sitting in millions of dollars.

715
01:03:58,106 --> 01:04:03,169
You have yet to be told what the cost is going to be for an anticipated construction

716
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:07,838
sidewalk, street reconstruction might be because of water and sewer.

717
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:13,500
So if you keep taking in these monies from Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer, you're overcharging them.

718
01:04:14,061 --> 01:04:19,083
You're overcharging them each and every year on this base rate, the speed, whatever it might be.

719
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:20,183
Point of information, Mr. President.

720
01:04:20,203 --> 01:04:21,724
Point of information, Vice President Knight.

721
01:04:21,804 --> 01:04:30,588
I think it's important to point out, and I understand what the council is saying, and I don't want to interrupt them, but I think it's important to point out that this base fee is something that's implemented by the administration.

722
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:34,859
It's not a vote that was taken by the council, does not require council approval.

723
01:04:35,059 --> 01:04:36,880
It's under the purview of the Water and Sewer Commission.

724
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,700
They meet monthly to discuss these type of items.

725
01:04:39,621 --> 01:04:49,064
And that the accounting that's being done should be done in accord with the GAA, the Government Accounting Office, the General Accepted Accounting Principles, Mr. President.

726
01:04:50,004 --> 01:04:56,666
And looking at what the gentleman's saying, I do have some agreement with what he's saying, but there's also some items that we need to clarify.

727
01:04:56,706 --> 01:04:59,407
And the first item we need to clarify is this is the doing of the council.

728
01:04:59,971 --> 01:05:01,992
This is the doing of the administration of the Water and Sewer Commission.

729
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:08,255
Well, while that may be true, there's also, you talk about general accounting practices.

730
01:05:08,295 --> 01:05:28,325
General accounting practices does state that if you are going to put a budgetary item on a budget, as you councilors get each and every year, the question needs to be asked, if I'm going to just put $100 million, so to speak, and put it into a line item, and there's no accounting of the money, other than the fact I just put it into an account, what's the purpose of that?

731
01:05:29,019 --> 01:05:40,589
So you're right, it's an administrative prerogative, but when it came up in May of 2017, it was contentiously argued at this Memphis City Council as to why we need this new fee.

732
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:46,955
And at that point in time, the argument was for the purposes of the meters, for the accounting of the meters.

733
01:05:47,015 --> 01:05:54,501
Now it's going into the general revenue, and now we're being told that there is no delineation, there's no explanation, there's no accounting of how that money's being spent.

734
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:56,123
So if that's the case,

735
01:05:56,607 --> 01:06:04,329
And as counselors, if there's no explanation of how it's being spent, before you used to have the accounting firm of Melanson and Heath, you don't have them anymore.

736
01:06:04,609 --> 01:06:06,529
You have them for like 15 years out of New Hampshire.

737
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:10,370
You have a new accounting company that comes in here, they're supposed to do an annual audit.

738
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:11,810
That question ought to come up.

739
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:25,013
Because if you remember correctly, if you looked at the Melanson and Heath audits, that was one of their concerns on the MWRA, especially in our water and sewer accounts, if you go back and read them, the accounting and the prioritizing how the money is spent.

740
01:06:25,946 --> 01:06:30,169
This account, or this money, Councilor Knight, there's no accounting with the money.

741
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:32,211
It just goes into a general revenue.

742
01:06:32,271 --> 01:06:34,493
I didn't say you didn't have legitimate concerns, Councilor Pinto.

743
01:06:34,513 --> 01:06:41,098
What I said was that it needs to be pointed out that the Memphis City Council isn't the one that implemented these fees, and Memphis City Council isn't the one that has the purview to remove them.

744
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:48,484
As watchdogs of the city's money, over and beyond the administration, the administration can make a proposal.

745
01:06:48,924 --> 01:06:50,305
The bottom line is here with the council.

746
01:06:50,325 --> 01:06:51,746
You either vote it up or you vote it down.

747
01:06:52,187 --> 01:06:53,788
And if you're going to vote it up or you're going to vote it down,

748
01:06:54,161 --> 01:06:55,902
The question is, what are you voting on?

749
01:06:56,222 --> 01:07:03,484
And if something comes to your attention to be questioned as to why and how, this is where it's going to take place in the Memphis City Council Chambers.

750
01:07:04,864 --> 01:07:09,846
But the matter is never going to come before us for us to vote up or down because it is not within our purview.

751
01:07:09,866 --> 01:07:11,726
It is within the purview of the Water and Sewer Commission.

752
01:07:11,746 --> 01:07:14,227
So the beef is not here in the Alden Chambers.

753
01:07:14,507 --> 01:07:16,388
It should be in room 201 with the Water and Sewer Commission.

754
01:07:18,148 --> 01:07:23,650
Then I would respectfully suggest, if we follow that train of thought, I would respectfully suggest a freedom of information

755
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:29,961
request to the city auditor, asking the city auditor.

756
01:07:30,681 --> 01:07:36,102
As to why, Mr. President, why there is no accounting.

757
01:07:36,362 --> 01:07:43,404
When you get the money from the MWRA ahead of time, before a budget is made, there's an accounting of how that money is going to be spent.

758
01:07:43,964 --> 01:07:44,504
You have money.

759
01:07:44,524 --> 01:07:45,984
What information, Mr. President?

760
01:07:46,504 --> 01:07:47,925
What information, Councilor Biss?

761
01:07:48,425 --> 01:07:51,466
Just, it's a public records request, not a freedom of information.

762
01:07:51,706 --> 01:07:52,066
Thank you.

763
01:07:53,166 --> 01:07:53,806
Thank you, Councilor Biss.

764
01:07:54,577 --> 01:07:58,559
I believe, Mr. President, a Freedom of Information Act can come from anybody.

765
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:05,902
And if the council does not get it as you got it from the response from the finance person, then you would go to that next group.

766
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:13,505
Because again, if you follow what Councilor Neider said, if allegedly it comes from the Water and Soil Commission, it's their call, maybe their call to implement it.

767
01:08:13,805 --> 01:08:17,567
But it's your call to decide how and where, if it's going to be spent.

768
01:08:17,727 --> 01:08:21,589
And you guys can ask for an accounting of how the money is being spent.

769
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:24,130
That's it.

770
01:08:24,487 --> 01:08:24,787
Thank you.

771
01:08:24,807 --> 01:08:36,951
You're more than happy to answer the questions because it's the finances of our community and you can't keep tagging on to Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer and now not having an answer or an explanation.

772
01:08:37,452 --> 01:08:39,252
Mr. President, Councilor Baxton.

773
01:08:40,373 --> 01:08:43,234
I wanna thank my former council colleague.

774
01:08:44,054 --> 01:08:52,717
I know he's very passionate on this and this is not the first time Councilor Penta spoke on this issue and he does raise some valid concerns.

775
01:08:53,662 --> 01:09:03,126
I offered the resolution back some several weeks ago and read thoroughly the response we got from Alicia Nunley, our finance director.

776
01:09:03,607 --> 01:09:15,572
And I also received the correspondence via email from the Water and Sewer Commission to the chair, Dominic Camara, who in my opinion, along with the rest of the board,

777
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:23,401
is doing a great job in a very difficult, as you can imagine, board to operate, Mr. President.

778
01:09:24,062 --> 01:09:37,488
And, you know, the response that we received from the administration, we did ask this council ask directly, if we're able to see the base rate, what that actually pays for within the water and sewer enterprise account.

779
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:44,331
And they were unable to break out that particular portion compared to just the regular rates

780
01:09:44,784 --> 01:09:50,866
and say, well, with the base rate, we paid for X, Y, and Z. And that's how they do their accounting.

781
01:09:50,966 --> 01:09:53,287
And personally, I don't see a problem with that.

782
01:09:53,927 --> 01:10:01,890
What Councilor Penter is asking for is more of an itemized type listing of where the expenditures are going based on what

783
01:10:02,462 --> 01:10:08,965
revenues coming in, and I'm not sure if they have the capability or capacity to report it out that way.

784
01:10:09,466 --> 01:10:14,228
But that, as Councilor Knight mentioned, that's not really end of our purview anyways.

785
01:10:15,289 --> 01:10:24,633
When this originally came out on the council, there was some concern because members of the council, including myself, thought this was a connectivity fee.

786
01:10:25,214 --> 01:10:31,517
And it raised a lot of eyebrows because at the time we said, wait a minute, we usually have a surplus in the water and sewer accounts,

787
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:39,099
of several million dollars, why would we need now all of a sudden start charging residents a connectivity fee?

788
01:10:39,379 --> 01:10:41,962
We're already connected to the water and sewer system.

789
01:10:43,103 --> 01:10:47,949
But come to find out it wasn't really a connectivity fee, it was a base rate fee.

790
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:50,913
And there is a difference, a substantial difference.

791
01:10:51,573 --> 01:10:56,298
And as Councilor Pinto alluded to, the base fee is a stabilizer.

792
01:10:56,818 --> 01:11:06,247
So the way it was told to me and the way I understand it is that every period, the billing period, we're not sure what we're going to receive for revenue.

793
01:11:07,019 --> 01:11:11,580
We know how much the MWRE is going to charge us because we have everything needed, right?

794
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:19,022
City Hall gets constant updates through the little antenna on your water meter telling how much the water usage is.

795
01:11:19,382 --> 01:11:23,723
So City Hall at any given minute could say how much the water consumption is.

796
01:11:24,123 --> 01:11:31,045
We have giant meters throughout the community that show the inflow and outflow of sewage.

797
01:11:31,585 --> 01:11:34,806
And we can tell you how much sewage is leaving this community.

798
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:36,786
So they have a good handle on

799
01:11:37,565 --> 01:11:41,327
what the fixed charges are in this community.

800
01:11:41,667 --> 01:11:46,509
The handle we don't have is how much revenue are we gonna bring in?

801
01:11:46,949 --> 01:11:55,352
Because there may be, especially during these fiscal difficult times during COVID, that someone may not be able to pay their water and sewer bill.

802
01:11:55,952 --> 01:11:58,613
And it happens not just during COVID, other times.

803
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:03,455
And so having, the way I understand it, a base rate set up

804
01:12:04,553 --> 01:12:06,714
It sets up a revenue stabilizer.

805
01:12:06,754 --> 01:12:14,000
So we know there's a million dollars guarantee that's coming from the rate payers that's gonna pay off what we owe.

806
01:12:14,941 --> 01:12:16,523
So it's not an extra charge.

807
01:12:17,043 --> 01:12:19,365
It is definitely not an extra charge in the bill.

808
01:12:19,685 --> 01:12:24,890
It goes towards paying off your rate, the water and sewer rate for the entire community.

809
01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:27,572
And it's somewhat provides a stabilizer.

810
01:12:28,272 --> 01:12:30,074
One would ask, why don't we raise it?

811
01:12:30,581 --> 01:12:32,963
because the million dollars is not much of a stabilizer.

812
01:12:33,224 --> 01:12:34,645
Why don't we raise that base fee?

813
01:12:35,005 --> 01:12:42,713
And then we can have guaranteed money in there and know where the money's coming from and serve the same purpose.

814
01:12:43,213 --> 01:12:46,356
So I think I understand where you're coming from councilor.

815
01:12:46,877 --> 01:12:51,441
I'm not quite sure the city has the capability of providing that level of detail.

816
01:12:51,908 --> 01:12:57,833
that you're looking for regarding what projects were done in the city, what infrastructure did this money go towards?

817
01:12:58,653 --> 01:12:59,294
Leak detection.

818
01:12:59,314 --> 01:13:01,635
You've been talking about leak detection for 20 years.

819
01:13:02,316 --> 01:13:08,541
We have a high percentage of water that's leaking out throughout the system, and it's costing the rate payers millions of dollars.

820
01:13:08,881 --> 01:13:12,664
The council has probably heard me a million times about inflow and infiltration.

821
01:13:12,984 --> 01:13:13,785
The sewer system.

822
01:13:14,305 --> 01:13:20,770
We accept groundwater that's going into the sewer system, and that groundwater is going out to Deer Island and being treated as raw sewage.

823
01:13:21,487 --> 01:13:23,268
costing us millions of dollars a year.

824
01:13:24,189 --> 01:13:26,190
And we're aware of it, but guess what?

825
01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:28,152
We have an aging infrastructure.

826
01:13:28,512 --> 01:13:30,514
You know, so this is a much larger issue.

827
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:33,436
I wanna thank the council for keeping it in front of us.

828
01:13:33,916 --> 01:13:48,627
You know, our water meters, like the new schools that we talk about that were put in 17 years ago, our water meters are now, the new water meters are 15 to 17 years old, and the life expectancy was roughly 13 to 15 years.

829
01:13:49,207 --> 01:13:50,428
And it's just a matter of time

830
01:13:50,822 --> 01:13:56,483
that we experienced when I first got on the council, that half of our meters were being estimated.

831
01:13:58,024 --> 01:14:04,485
That's when the city steps in and says, you know, Mr. Panto, we don't know how much you're using for water, but we're gonna estimate your bill.

832
01:14:04,865 --> 01:14:07,726
How would you like your bill to be estimated and not actual?

833
01:14:08,326 --> 01:14:11,187
So they could be charging you double what you're actually using.

834
01:14:11,447 --> 01:14:13,847
And that's why we put the emphasis on these new meters.

835
01:14:14,187 --> 01:14:16,628
And now we're coming up to a period of time where

836
01:14:17,059 --> 01:14:27,488
You know, we have to look at these meters and it's a multi-million dollar project, but it's very important that people get charged exactly what they're using, Mr. President, very important.

837
01:14:27,508 --> 01:14:29,730
And I'll always support that, Mr. President.

838
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:34,194
And the days of estimating are over in my opinion.

839
01:14:34,334 --> 01:14:36,496
So I appreciate the council bringing it up.

840
01:14:37,317 --> 01:14:44,303
I always look forward to hearing Councilor Penter and he does his homework and research and I thank you for bringing it up again.

841
01:14:44,852 --> 01:14:50,806
Mr. President, just on that matter, just to go back and reflect, Demita's had a lifespan of 10 to 12 years.

842
01:14:50,826 --> 01:14:51,828
I don't know if it's 13 to 15.

843
01:14:52,986 --> 01:15:06,117
But that's a perfect example, a perfect example of when you have a budget that's coming up from the Department of Public Works, having a projection, for example, on new water meters, that dollar amount in anticipation needs to be in there.

844
01:15:06,377 --> 01:15:16,885
And while it's into the proposed budget that you folks deliberate over, it's likewise the same type of money that can be deliberated over the base fee for which goes in there.

845
01:15:17,406 --> 01:15:21,469
You back then, Council March, talked about the retained earnings, but the retained earnings,

846
01:15:21,781 --> 01:15:28,107
has to be something that's certified and qualified by the Department of Revenue and subsequently voted upon by the city council.

847
01:15:28,587 --> 01:15:43,120
So taking all of that into consideration, you're dealing with a multi-million dollar surplus right now in your water and sewer account, and you also have inclusive of that multi-million dollar, you're talking about two and a half million dollars right now that's been collected.

848
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:48,425
So how does that fit into either retained earnings or the water and sewer balance

849
01:15:49,425 --> 01:15:53,226
Is it off by two and a half minute because this is a new dollar amount in there?

850
01:15:53,426 --> 01:15:55,447
Just a point of information, Mr. President.

851
01:15:56,788 --> 01:16:05,491
Just a point of information, this council, and I believe you were part of it back some years ago, we've voted year after year after year to use retained earnings to offset the rates.

852
01:16:06,191 --> 01:16:09,132
And the rates over the last couple of years were going to go up double digits.

853
01:16:09,582 --> 01:16:23,129
And if it wasn't for this council and previous council stepping up and offsetting it with the, which is rate payers money, but offsetting with that money that you're talking about in retained earnings, the rates would have gone up even higher.

854
01:16:23,169 --> 01:16:25,750
So I just want to set the record straight on that.

855
01:16:25,770 --> 01:16:27,051
And in 2016, Mr. President, the deficit was 467,000.

856
01:16:27,091 --> 01:16:27,511
And in 2017, it was 427,000.

857
01:16:27,551 --> 01:16:30,713
That was on the SOAR account, but that was offset on the opposite side.

858
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:41,196
Council March is talking about because of the retained earnings of the surplus that was in the water and sewer.

859
01:16:41,516 --> 01:16:55,427
All I'm saying, all I'm saying is this account, if it's included in your water and sewer account, it should be accounted for and how it's spent or anticipated to be spent, just like any project that's going to be done in the forthcoming year.

860
01:16:55,767 --> 01:17:00,310
And there was also a dollar amount contained in the budget for unanticipated expenses.

861
01:17:00,991 --> 01:17:05,534
You may have a street that just blows open, a major line that blows open, I don't know, but the money is there.

862
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:17,249
And lastly, let me just say this, Mr. President, each and every year, I don't know, coming into this year, each and every year, there's been approximately a million dollars in surplus that's left over from the prior year's budget.

863
01:17:17,769 --> 01:17:32,140
So each and every year for the last maybe 10 to 12 years, there's been approximately a million dollars, and that money, which is left over, once it's certified by the Department of Revenue, it's leftover money, can be used for any unanticipated debt deficit that takes place in the city.

864
01:17:32,761 --> 01:17:35,083
But we don't have to do it because you've got surpluses,

865
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:37,300
in the water and sewer enterprise.

866
01:17:38,180 --> 01:17:38,480
Thank you.

867
01:17:38,501 --> 01:17:40,141
You're welcome.

868
01:17:40,642 --> 01:17:40,942
Thank you.

869
01:17:43,583 --> 01:17:44,044
You're welcome.

870
01:17:44,064 --> 01:17:45,564
We have another participant that would like to speak.

871
01:17:45,584 --> 01:17:46,865
Oh, I'm sorry.

872
01:17:49,527 --> 01:17:51,147
No, you wanna speak on the public participation?

873
01:17:53,169 --> 01:17:54,109
You just came to visit us?

874
01:17:55,330 --> 01:17:58,872
We're glad to have you here.

875
01:17:58,932 --> 01:18:01,033
Council Mark says I think he has one more on the suspension.

876
01:18:05,577 --> 01:18:05,757
2-0-2-1-0-9-2.

877
01:18:05,777 --> 01:18:08,439
2-1-0-9-2 offered by President Caravelle be resolved.

878
01:18:08,459 --> 01:18:09,539
2-1-0-9-2 out of suspension.

879
01:18:30,109 --> 01:18:31,390
You're talking about the condolence.

880
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:32,691
No, not that.

881
01:18:32,711 --> 01:18:34,233
21092, opened by President Cabrera.

882
01:18:34,253 --> 01:18:40,638
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council discuss the following letter of interest from a candidate for the Haumel Commission.

883
01:18:41,859 --> 01:18:43,440
You have a copy of the letter on file here.

884
01:18:44,001 --> 01:18:47,204
And I think Mr. Collins is on the call here.

885
01:18:47,224 --> 01:18:47,884
Brian, are you here?

886
01:18:47,904 --> 01:18:51,487
For those of you who don't know, this is Brian Collins.

887
01:18:52,348 --> 01:18:55,310
He's a member of the Western Community Center.

888
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:58,273
He runs many successful programs over there.

889
01:18:58,943 --> 01:19:04,009
And Brian has expressed interest in the Bacon-Hormel Commission.

890
01:19:04,669 --> 01:19:13,058
And there were some other candidates, but they did not put in the application.

891
01:19:13,078 --> 01:19:18,364
So Brian, if you want to give us just a little option about yourself.

892
01:19:19,142 --> 01:19:20,123
Sure, absolutely.

893
01:19:20,263 --> 01:19:23,805
So I'm a lifelong resident of Medford.

894
01:19:23,825 --> 01:19:29,528
I went to school here, graduated, and now I worked and raised my daughter here.

895
01:19:30,089 --> 01:19:35,212
And I've been volunteering on the board for the West Medford Community Center for the past 12 years.

896
01:19:36,193 --> 01:19:42,436
I enjoy working with the kids in the community and bringing the good things that we do at the West Medford Community Center.

897
01:19:42,917 --> 01:19:47,139
So I was grateful to get an offer to work on the whole male

898
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:57,404
committee to do the same thing there and make that awesome field available to the kids and the organizations of Medford.

899
01:19:57,444 --> 01:19:59,104
So thank you for the invitation.

900
01:19:59,745 --> 01:20:00,305
Thank you, Brian.

901
01:20:00,545 --> 01:20:02,205
Councilor Scott Pele.

902
01:20:02,346 --> 01:20:04,286
Thank you, Mr. Collins for applying.

903
01:20:04,847 --> 01:20:07,868
I know Mr. Collins from a lot of volunteer work.

904
01:20:08,328 --> 01:20:12,670
I know the basketball programs at Duggar Park and also with our

905
01:20:15,673 --> 01:20:18,215
our fundraising that goes on during the summer.

906
01:20:19,516 --> 01:20:21,798
And I appreciate his application.

907
01:20:21,838 --> 01:20:27,522
I think he would be a valuable member of this commission and I would support him wholeheartedly.

908
01:20:27,542 --> 01:20:29,224
So thank you for reaching out.

909
01:20:29,244 --> 01:20:36,409
I think you would really make the Hormel Commission a most successful venture.

910
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:36,910
So thank you.

911
01:20:39,248 --> 01:20:40,569
Mr. President, thank you very much.

912
01:20:41,229 --> 01:20:52,356
When I learned that the existing council appointment, Mr. Guayona was not interested in reapplying for the position, I became very concerned about how we were going to fill this position and what quality of candidates we've received.

913
01:20:52,997 --> 01:20:59,941
And when I saw the email of one, Mr. Brian Collins and his interest in serving on the position, it certainly

914
01:21:00,758 --> 01:21:01,599
set my fears at ease.

915
01:21:02,099 --> 01:21:06,101
I've had the ability and the good fortune of having to work with Brian for a number of years.

916
01:21:06,221 --> 01:21:07,802
I also grew up in West Medford.

917
01:21:08,202 --> 01:21:09,823
Don't let him fool you, he's a West Medford legend.

918
01:21:09,883 --> 01:21:13,625
Everybody who grew up in West Medford knows Brian Collins, knows who Brian and Mark are.

919
01:21:13,645 --> 01:21:23,570
He's a great guy and he's someone that puts his money where his mouth is, Mr. President, has a great proven track record of bringing successful programming to our community and also thinking outside the box.

920
01:21:24,097 --> 01:21:29,420
And watching what he's done down in the center, it's unbelievable to see the amount of program and the amount of effort and hard work that he's put in there.

921
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:33,543
How the center's evolved over the last 12 years since he's been involved is amazing.

922
01:21:34,163 --> 01:21:41,707
So with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly feel very confident in the application of Brian Collins to serve on the whole mail commission.

923
01:21:42,108 --> 01:21:44,149
And I for one would move for approval of appointment.

924
01:21:44,549 --> 01:21:46,090
Thank you.

925
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:47,311
Council Bis.

926
01:21:48,431 --> 01:21:49,352
Thank you, Mr. President.

927
01:21:49,392 --> 01:21:50,032
And hi, Brian.

928
01:21:50,132 --> 01:21:50,853
It's good to see you.

929
01:21:52,445 --> 01:22:05,292
you know, I can only echo what my colleagues have said about what you've done for our community and the great work of the West Medford Community Center and how much it's grown and such a, you know, even more vibrant now than it was years ago, which is great.

930
01:22:05,652 --> 01:22:20,360
And I, you know, I just like, since we're appointing you, I like to, you know, try to ask a question and just what's a project or something that you'd really like to get started on at Hormel Stadium if you were appointed to the position?

931
01:22:21,959 --> 01:22:24,621
So it's a great question.

932
01:22:24,881 --> 01:22:31,725
And I usually take, I listen to what the community wants.

933
01:22:31,865 --> 01:22:39,870
So for instance, at the community center, it's not so much of me driving the programs.

934
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:44,553
It's me listening to the kids in the community of what things they would want to see.

935
01:22:45,113 --> 01:22:50,054
So for instance, I recall growing up here, we never had girls basketball.

936
01:22:50,434 --> 01:22:56,196
But six or seven years ago, the parents would come to me and say, how come all the boys get basketball?

937
01:22:56,516 --> 01:22:58,316
No one ever pays attention to the girls.

938
01:22:58,876 --> 01:22:59,957
And I got a daughter.

939
01:23:00,277 --> 01:23:01,977
So I actually felt the same way.

940
01:23:02,317 --> 01:23:09,079
So when something like that comes to my attention, that's what I would be more in a movement in that direction.

941
01:23:09,419 --> 01:23:14,320
So I would be more of listening to what the community would like to see at Hormel.

942
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:16,882
as opposed to any personal preference?

943
01:23:19,464 --> 01:23:20,344
That's fantastic.

944
01:23:20,404 --> 01:23:24,007
And I think that's exactly, you know, should have expected that answer from you.

945
01:23:24,127 --> 01:23:25,128
So thank you very much.

946
01:23:25,909 --> 01:23:26,789
Thank you.

947
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:29,131
Thank you, Mr. President.

948
01:23:29,271 --> 01:23:36,357
And I would ask my colleagues to wait to tell Brian how much work this is until we take our vote.

949
01:23:37,077 --> 01:23:44,303
But no, you know, anyone in the community that's been around the community knows the amount of time Brian puts in at the West Memphis Community Center.

950
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:47,514
how he volunteers endlessly across the city.

951
01:23:48,174 --> 01:23:50,315
His organizational skills are impeccable.

952
01:23:50,975 --> 01:23:55,397
Look at the offerings and how far the West Memphis Community Center has come over the years.

953
01:23:55,917 --> 01:24:08,361
And, you know, Brian won't toot his own horn and I know there's a lot of good people there, but Brian is largely due in part to what he's done for that West Memphis Community Center over the years.

954
01:24:08,722 --> 01:24:12,623
As you can see, he's a level-headed person, which is needed on boards and commissions.

955
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:19,266
He's a man of reason and a person of understanding, and I think he would be a great fit, Mr. President.

956
01:24:19,566 --> 01:24:21,487
We don't have many appointments as a council.

957
01:24:21,828 --> 01:24:25,071
You can count them on one hand, how many appointments we have.

958
01:24:25,411 --> 01:24:29,655
So this is important to us as a council, and it's important we pick the right person.

959
01:24:30,255 --> 01:24:34,279
And without a doubt, Brian is going to do some remarkable things down there.

960
01:24:34,299 --> 01:24:37,922
We have a beautiful stadium, Mr. President, we can all be proud of.

961
01:24:38,593 --> 01:24:43,056
And I know Brian will continue to make that a showplace for our community.

962
01:24:43,456 --> 01:24:43,796
Thank you.

963
01:24:44,076 --> 01:24:44,757
Councilor Falco.

964
01:24:45,677 --> 01:24:46,418
Thank you, Mr. President.

965
01:24:46,438 --> 01:24:49,800
I want to thank Brian for his interest in the position.

966
01:24:50,240 --> 01:24:55,303
I've known Brian for years through his work at the West Bedford Community Center.

967
01:24:55,984 --> 01:24:58,285
And he's always there.

968
01:24:58,305 --> 01:25:04,409
I know he's always put a lot of time, effort, and energy into program development, really getting

969
01:25:05,045 --> 01:25:08,386
getting things running and keeping things moving over the West Bedford Community Center.

970
01:25:08,406 --> 01:25:11,807
It's always been a successful program, but he's been involved for many years.

971
01:25:11,867 --> 01:25:14,327
I know he's been a real big part of that success.

972
01:25:15,047 --> 01:25:18,188
And I think, you know, Brian just hit it on the head when he said it earlier, listening.

973
01:25:18,888 --> 01:25:23,349
That's what a lot of this comes down to, listening to what the community wants, listening to what the community needs.

974
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:31,231
And I think he's been a valuable asset at the West Bedford Community Center, and I think he's going to be a valuable asset on the Whole Milk Commission as well.

975
01:25:31,791 --> 01:25:34,352
I thank him for his interest, and I definitely support

976
01:25:35,140 --> 01:25:35,861
disappointment.

977
01:25:35,901 --> 01:25:38,783
So Brian, thank you very much.

978
01:25:39,624 --> 01:25:40,465
Thank you, Mr President.

979
01:25:40,485 --> 01:25:48,772
Yeah, it's hard to hard to go last when someone such a hard working and highly committed person this community, but I like everyone else on the council.

980
01:25:49,052 --> 01:25:55,417
Seemingly everyone else in the community have had the pleasure of working with Brian through some through some things at the West Medford Community Center.

981
01:25:56,892 --> 01:25:57,732
He's a stalwart there.

982
01:25:57,772 --> 01:25:59,333
He does an incredible amount of work there.

983
01:25:59,853 --> 01:26:15,940
And thank you, Councilor Behrs and thank you for Brian for speaking on it, the girls basketball program, because that's something that I think when your name comes up, people just talk about, you know, recently, just how wildly popular and successful that program was and really loved and you know, as as things get back to normal, hopefully coming back.

984
01:26:17,021 --> 01:26:20,322
So I think that's just a really great example of the kind of work you do.

985
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:22,043
And as far as that listening, so I, I

986
01:26:23,166 --> 01:26:26,729
support this appointment and I think you would be a great addition to the Hormel Commission.

987
01:26:28,350 --> 01:26:35,436
Thank you and personally I've known Brian for about 10 years now and he's done remarkable work at the center there.

988
01:26:36,277 --> 01:26:40,221
He's attentive to everyone's needs and the big thing is he listens.

989
01:26:40,441 --> 01:26:45,325
He listens to what people want and that's why he's successful working

990
01:26:45,705 --> 01:26:46,285
with the community.

991
01:26:46,325 --> 01:26:59,733
So again, and I also support Brian for the job and wait a motion from the floor, which is Councilor Scarpelli as president to nominate and select Brian Collins as seconded by Vice President Knight.

992
01:26:59,753 --> 01:27:00,973
Mr. President, before you call the roll.

993
01:27:01,313 --> 01:27:01,894
Councilor Marks.

994
01:27:02,314 --> 01:27:15,541
I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the outgoing Commissioner Lenny Gliona, who has done a tremendous job representing not only the Hormel Commission, but this Memphis City Council who appointed him back

995
01:27:15,911 --> 01:27:25,178
some several years ago that have made great strides at Hormel, largely in part of Lenny's input and his diligence to this community.

996
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:26,779
So I wanted to personally thank him.

997
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:32,983
And I too want to thank Len for his years of dedication on the commission there.

998
01:27:33,644 --> 01:27:41,850
And I know Len will be showing up on some other project within the community because that's the kind of guy that he is.

999
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:45,092
So I know I'll be seeing his name somewhere else.

1000
01:27:50,316 --> 01:27:50,876
Mr. President.

1001
01:27:51,576 --> 01:27:53,576
Oh, sorry.

1002
01:27:53,897 --> 01:27:54,497
Thank you, Mr. President.

1003
01:27:54,837 --> 01:27:59,938
I would just be remiss if it's since the time to thank Len for his hard work on the commission has come up.

1004
01:27:59,998 --> 01:28:01,518
I'd be remiss if I didn't add my voice.

1005
01:28:01,638 --> 01:28:07,199
I've become a close friend of Mr. Lyon and I know he's took his role very seriously and worked very hard on it.

1006
01:28:07,419 --> 01:28:10,000
And I thank him for his years of service on it.

1007
01:28:11,635 --> 01:28:12,676
Thank you, Mr. President.

1008
01:28:13,036 --> 01:28:23,321
If I may, I'm really brief, but to echo the sentiments of my colleagues that just spoke, I also thank Mr. Guiliano for his years of commitment to the position.

1009
01:28:23,341 --> 01:28:23,641
Thank you.

1010
01:28:23,661 --> 01:28:25,182
Thank you, Mr. President.

1011
01:28:25,202 --> 01:28:27,923
Mr. President, I was going to put a resolution on next week to thank him.

1012
01:28:28,404 --> 01:28:31,105
I would have had to do that now that you went out of my sales here.

1013
01:28:32,126 --> 01:28:34,707
The motion by Councilor Scott Bailey, seconded by Vice President Knight.

1014
01:28:34,747 --> 01:28:35,907
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1015
01:28:39,169 --> 01:28:39,749
Councilor Behrs.

1016
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:40,530
Yes.

1017
01:28:43,337 --> 01:28:44,018
Councilor Falco.

1018
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:44,378
Yes.

1019
01:28:44,678 --> 01:28:45,399
Vice President Knight.

1020
01:28:45,479 --> 01:28:45,739
Yes.

1021
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:46,760
Councilor Marks.

1022
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:47,161
Yes.

1023
01:28:47,561 --> 01:28:48,202
Councilor Morrell.

1024
01:28:48,522 --> 01:28:48,782
Yes.

1025
01:28:49,683 --> 01:28:50,424
Councilor Scarpelli.

1026
01:28:50,604 --> 01:28:50,924
Yes.

1027
01:28:51,105 --> 01:28:51,845
President Caravagno.

1028
01:28:51,965 --> 01:28:52,166
Yes.

1029
01:28:52,266 --> 01:28:53,527
I mean, for most passes.

1030
01:28:54,208 --> 01:28:58,772
Brian, welcome to the commission and we look forward to working with you in the future.

1031
01:28:59,453 --> 01:29:00,173
Thank you so much.

1032
01:29:00,213 --> 01:29:01,395
Thank you for the opportunity.

1033
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:03,597
Good luck, Brian.

1034
01:29:03,617 --> 01:29:04,438
Thank you very much.

1035
01:29:04,818 --> 01:29:05,098
Thank you.

1036
01:29:06,159 --> 01:29:07,641
First, let me bring back the regular business.

1037
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:10,180
Yes.

1038
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:10,280
Yes.

1039
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:10,440
Yes.

1040
01:29:10,460 --> 01:29:10,520
Yes.

1041
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:10,940
Yes.

1042
01:29:11,020 --> 01:29:11,160
Yes.

1043
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:11,360
Yes.

1044
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:11,500
Yes.

1045
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:11,620
Yes.

1046
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:11,760
Yes.

1047
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:12,080
Yes.

1048
01:29:12,120 --> 01:29:12,240
Yes.

1049
01:29:39,892 --> 01:29:47,419
capital plan to reflect the resurfacing of city roads and the revitalization of Memphis Square and Mystic Avenue as year one priorities.

1050
01:29:47,439 --> 01:29:54,986
And be it further resolved, the capital plan be adjusted to call for a resurfacing of no less than 10 miles of roadway per year.

1051
01:29:55,026 --> 01:29:55,767
Vice President Knight.

1052
01:29:56,027 --> 01:29:57,708
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1053
01:29:58,509 --> 01:30:00,251
Here in the city of Memphis, we have about 140 miles of roadway.

1054
01:30:02,395 --> 01:30:09,401
And if we look at the capital plan that was released last week, I had the opportunity to watch the meeting on local access television.

1055
01:30:09,421 --> 01:30:12,723
Pat Gordon did a good job delivering that TV program to us last week.

1056
01:30:13,484 --> 01:30:23,072
If you look at the capital plan, you'll see that over a six-year period, it calls for the resurfacing of about 11 roads, Mr. President.

1057
01:30:23,632 --> 01:30:31,038
Now, we're a community that has 145 miles of roadway, and I don't think there's one street in this community at this point in time that's

1058
01:30:31,672 --> 01:30:38,495
pristinely paved from curb to curb with no potholes, no markings, no proper markings and signage, proper crosswalks and the like.

1059
01:30:40,016 --> 01:30:52,102
Everybody in this community uses roads to get from point A to point B, whether it be school buses, fire engines, plows, police cars, you and me, bicycles, pedestrians, everybody uses the streets, Mr. President.

1060
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:56,444
And the condition of our roadways at this point in time are subpar.

1061
01:30:57,004 --> 01:30:59,966
When you look at surrounding communities, you can tell when you get there.

1062
01:31:01,034 --> 01:31:02,255
because the pavement changes.

1063
01:31:02,855 --> 01:31:06,017
When you drive from Bedford into Malden, all of a sudden the ride gets a little less bumpy.

1064
01:31:06,638 --> 01:31:08,859
The same thing when you go into Arlington or Somerville or Winchester.

1065
01:31:09,499 --> 01:31:11,160
So Mr. President, we have a capital plan.

1066
01:31:11,321 --> 01:31:14,703
We've heard a lot about this pavement inventory that was going to be taken by the administration.

1067
01:31:16,364 --> 01:31:21,087
Ultimately at this point in time, you know, the curb appeal in this community isn't what it once was.

1068
01:31:21,787 --> 01:31:25,890
And we need to start investing money back in our infrastructure so that our curb appeal

1069
01:31:26,758 --> 01:31:32,483
can be something that's enticing, so that a curb appeal can be something that when a taxpayer looks out their window, they can be proud of.

1070
01:31:33,064 --> 01:31:37,789
Instead of having to call C-Click fix, they can smile and tell their friends, why don't you come over and take a look at what a great job they did.

1071
01:31:38,429 --> 01:31:43,674
I will say this, the plowing that's been done in the community over the past year or so has been excellent, Mr. President.

1072
01:31:44,375 --> 01:31:49,720
But with that being said, the toll that's taken on our roads is beginning to show.

1073
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:56,415
So with that being said, I'm requesting that the administration adjust the capital plan to take into consideration our aging infrastructure and roadways.

1074
01:31:58,317 --> 01:32:02,801
With 10 miles a year, it would still take us 14 years to resurface each roadway in the community.

1075
01:32:04,142 --> 01:32:10,067
So it's an ambitious goal, Mr. President, but I feel as though we need to do something more ambitious than 12 streets over six years.

1076
01:32:11,569 --> 01:32:16,093
That coupled with the fact that we've been talking about ways to generate revenue in this community, to generate new growth,

1077
01:32:16,748 --> 01:32:18,930
to address the $5 to $8 million budget deficit.

1078
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:25,974
We've been discussing the revitalization of Method Square now since the 100-year parade when I was in the fifth grade.

1079
01:32:26,635 --> 01:32:30,797
And we had a great opportunity to address some concerns along Mystic Gap.

1080
01:32:31,338 --> 01:32:36,421
And I think that that's kind of fallen by the wayside after all the work that the Metropolitan Area Planning Council has done.

1081
01:32:36,921 --> 01:32:39,703
I'm very happy of the work that we've been able to do with Mr. Barbrowski.

1082
01:32:40,164 --> 01:32:43,586
And once we get this recodification process

1083
01:32:44,180 --> 01:32:50,184
completed, I look forward to moving forward and hopefully securing the zoning consultant for further review of our zoning ordinances.

1084
01:32:50,785 --> 01:32:54,187
But with that being said, Mr. President, I asked my council colleagues to support this resolution.

1085
01:32:54,787 --> 01:32:58,790
I feel as though it's a capital plan that needs to invest in things that matter.

1086
01:32:59,331 --> 01:33:01,912
And one thing that everybody in this community uses is our roads.

1087
01:33:03,874 --> 01:33:06,456
So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support the resolution.

1088
01:33:06,716 --> 01:33:07,516
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1089
01:33:07,536 --> 01:33:08,097
Councilor Baez.

1090
01:33:08,857 --> 01:33:09,638
Thank you, Mr. President.

1091
01:33:09,698 --> 01:33:12,620
I agree with Councilor Knight's sentiment and I will be supporting the resolution.

1092
01:33:13,155 --> 01:33:26,186
I'd just like to propose a B paper that also asks how many miles would be resurfaced per year under the initial proposal from the administration?

1093
01:33:28,868 --> 01:33:34,112
Yes, how many miles per year proposed under the initial capital plan draft?

1094
01:33:34,953 --> 01:33:36,114
Thank you, Mr. President.

1095
01:33:36,214 --> 01:33:40,217
I want to thank Vice President Knight for bringing this up.

1096
01:33:42,178 --> 01:33:47,781
I think behind this rail, we've all spoken about sidewalks and roads ad nauseum.

1097
01:33:48,461 --> 01:33:52,603
And I think this is a great proposal.

1098
01:33:53,124 --> 01:34:02,829
However, Mr. President, with that being said, we as a council have not had the opportunity to sit down as a council and go over the capital plan.

1099
01:34:03,429 --> 01:34:10,133
And I would respectfully ask my colleague to hold off on this until we have the ability as a council to sit down

1100
01:34:10,718 --> 01:34:18,823
and go through what we believe are some of the issues that we would like to see addressed within the capital plan and not do it piecemeal.

1101
01:34:19,424 --> 01:34:30,911
And I would just respectfully ask my council colleague to either withdraw this or set up a meeting where we can sit down and have a meaningful dialogue.

1102
01:34:30,971 --> 01:34:32,852
It's $107 million proposal.

1103
01:34:33,453 --> 01:34:36,915
And I also had the opportunity to watch it, Mr. President.

1104
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:39,817
And there are a lot of unanswered questions

1105
01:34:40,277 --> 01:34:50,235
from the school appropriation to when the fire department will eventually see their buildings be refurbished and why are we waiting so long to refurbish?

1106
01:34:50,605 --> 01:34:55,407
the fire headquarters, as well as the other existing buildings.

1107
01:34:55,787 --> 01:34:57,988
I think there's a lot that needs to go over.

1108
01:34:58,548 --> 01:35:04,671
And I don't want to send a message that if we do support this, that this is what the council is looking for.

1109
01:35:05,111 --> 01:35:10,733
And that's it, Mr. President, because that's furthest from I as one member of the council.

1110
01:35:10,773 --> 01:35:14,275
So I hope my council colleague can appreciate that.

1111
01:35:14,315 --> 01:35:19,017
And maybe we can use this as a catalyst to take a look at the capital plan

1112
01:35:19,538 --> 01:35:23,579
and see what the needs are as a council and as a community.

1113
01:35:23,639 --> 01:35:25,179
The way I look at it, Mr. President, is this.

1114
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:26,460
The plan's been released.

1115
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:27,460
The plan is the plan.

1116
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:31,421
The mayor didn't involve us in the planning procedure, in the planning process.

1117
01:35:32,221 --> 01:35:40,283
This council, week in and week out, sends the administration requests in the form of resolutions, making requests and recommendations as to where money should be invested.

1118
01:35:41,963 --> 01:35:45,264
This proposal right here falls in line with the votes that the council's taken in the past.

1119
01:35:45,957 --> 01:35:49,039
I understand where he's coming from, but I respectfully decline.

1120
01:35:49,079 --> 01:35:50,700
I'd like to have the paper be voted on, Mr. President.

1121
01:35:50,720 --> 01:35:52,561
I'd like to see the capital plan addressed.

1122
01:35:52,641 --> 01:35:54,402
I've had enough of the condition of these roadways.

1123
01:35:54,702 --> 01:36:02,326
I've been banging on this table since I got elected, talking about public utilities coming in this community, tearing up our streets, about what we're gonna do to come up with a plan.

1124
01:36:02,346 --> 01:36:04,868
And we're not getting anywhere.

1125
01:36:05,068 --> 01:36:06,909
Now we have a capital investment plan, Mr. President.

1126
01:36:06,929 --> 01:36:08,750
We have a CIP and it doesn't address our streets.

1127
01:36:10,291 --> 01:36:12,652
So if the council is taking these votes and we're serious about the votes we've taken,

1128
01:36:13,433 --> 01:36:15,534
And there are many other items that are going to be priorities.

1129
01:36:15,614 --> 01:36:18,335
I certainly don't feel as though that's an incorrect statement to make.

1130
01:36:18,715 --> 01:36:24,238
And I certainly understand that Councilor Marks has some priorities that he's fighting for as does Councilor Scott Kelly and so Councilor Falco.

1131
01:36:24,398 --> 01:36:31,721
But with that being said, Mr. President, the paper that's before us is to ask that the capital plan be adjusted to call for these things as year one priorities.

1132
01:36:32,461 --> 01:36:34,822
Any further putting it off is going to put us into year two.

1133
01:36:34,842 --> 01:36:36,082
There won't be year one priorities.

1134
01:36:36,863 --> 01:36:38,964
So with that being said, I'd ask my colleagues to support the paper.

1135
01:36:40,498 --> 01:36:41,558
It is what it is, Mr. President.

1136
01:36:42,078 --> 01:36:43,058
The mayor released the plan.

1137
01:36:43,278 --> 01:36:44,899
We asked for an opportunity to have involvement.

1138
01:36:45,519 --> 01:36:47,599
That opportunity wasn't afforded or awarded to us.

1139
01:36:47,739 --> 01:36:53,120
So now we gotta do what we gotta do to get in there what we think is important for our constituents in this community.

1140
01:36:53,400 --> 01:36:55,521
This is the approach I'd like to take in doing it, Mr. President.

1141
01:36:55,541 --> 01:37:00,301
I'd like to be put on record knowing that I support resurfacing of our roadways.

1142
01:37:00,421 --> 01:37:02,202
Again, it's something that everybody in this community uses.

1143
01:37:02,602 --> 01:37:03,942
It's something that everybody in this community needs.

1144
01:37:04,502 --> 01:37:06,542
And the quality there right now is awful.

1145
01:37:07,082 --> 01:37:10,223
So with that being said, I respectfully decline the gentleman's request

1146
01:37:10,646 --> 01:37:11,767
at this point in time, I feel.

1147
01:37:11,807 --> 01:37:13,710
Mr. President, if I could.

1148
01:37:14,791 --> 01:37:25,483
As I stated, I don't think anyone's been a bigger advocate of roads over my term on the council in discussing the needs and the fact that we don't put any money in the budget for roads.

1149
01:37:26,384 --> 01:37:31,850
From what I've been told by the mayor, and the mayor can correct me if I'm wrong, she told me this was a draft capital plan.
