Sincerely yours, Brianna Longo, current mayor.

43
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,343
Do I have any discussion on the end of year transfers?

44
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:25,066
If we could get a financial presentation from the finance department, Madam President.

45
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:26,368
Absolutely.

46
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:27,228
Dr. Dickinson, if you could.

47
00:03:38,057 --> 00:03:38,537
Hi, all.

48
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:41,139
Essentially, this is year end cleanup.

49
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,281
These are budgets that were overspent.

50
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:55,471
We went through the budget, looked at every department, as voted from the votes you took a year ago.

51
00:03:56,632 --> 00:04:03,397
And... No, of course not.

52
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:07,480
I need my own microphone.

53
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:11,223
In order to, this is just...

54
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:12,518
It doesn't reach.

55
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:13,979
No, it doesn't have long enough.

56
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,360
We'll rip it apart.

57
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:26,430
Oh boy.

58
00:04:30,693 --> 00:04:31,574
I got a green light.

59
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:32,815
He's working on it.

60
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:33,756
Testing one, two, three.

61
00:04:34,837 --> 00:04:37,980
Z-Y-X-W-E-T-S-R-Q-P-O-N-M-L-K-G-I-H.

62
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:45,617
Yes, so we go through the budget, budget to expenses.

63
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:49,518
We looked at what you voted last spring.

64
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:53,599
These unfortunately are departments that are slightly overspent.

65
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:59,882
So, I mean, the individual like Chevalier Theater, a thousand bucks.

66
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:06,764
Ordinarily in my life, we'd be looking at this stuff starting in,

67
00:05:08,865 --> 00:05:12,948
March, but unfortunately I wasn't working here then.

68
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:20,773
So this is really just cleaning up so we're not over appropriation on any of these categories.

69
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:27,258
Some of them are actually, we've put a little bit more in there in case there are other expenses that might come through at the end of the year.

70
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:30,700
President Behrs.

71
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,721
Thank you, Madam President.

72
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:37,825
I understand the end of your transfer process pretty well at this point, but I have one question.

73
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:43,476
How did we end up overspending by almost $200,000 in the law department?

74
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:55,401
Those were some legal bills that we incurred in the middle of the year that were not entered into the system.

75
00:05:56,941 --> 00:05:59,923
So I can't really speak to what they were for.

76
00:06:01,543 --> 00:06:07,105
Would anyone else from the administration have a potential answer as to what those were for and who they were paid to?

77
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:17,010
If allowable by the City Council, I would offer to Finance Director Dickinson to hold on to that microphone.

78
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,770
I won't be needing it.

79
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:20,312
Thank you very much.

80
00:06:20,452 --> 00:06:27,275
I believe we have a attorney on Zoom at this point, but I'm just messaging them right now.

81
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:31,077
One of those items is actually a settlement in the amount of $137,000.

82
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:47,918
The other item is $55,000, which the city council had previously approved, but mechanically based on the timing of that approval, it needs to be revoted essentially, is the short answer.

83
00:06:48,698 --> 00:06:52,660
So 137 plus the 55 is the number that's in before you today.

84
00:06:55,702 --> 00:06:56,823
And who are we looking for on Zoom?

85
00:06:57,003 --> 00:06:58,764
Madam President for me.

86
00:06:58,924 --> 00:06:59,384
Councillor Neill.

87
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:01,045
Can you just discuss the nature of the settlement for $137,000?

88
00:07:02,573 --> 00:07:05,954
I defer to council and it looks like they're probably online, hopefully.

89
00:07:05,994 --> 00:07:07,054
What's the name?

90
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:08,494
It might be Deborah Ecker.

91
00:07:08,514 --> 00:07:14,156
It might be.

92
00:07:14,376 --> 00:07:14,856
Deb Ecker.

93
00:07:17,497 --> 00:07:20,898
Not seeing unless they're under a different name.

94
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,700
I know that

95
00:07:31,669 --> 00:07:31,829
Ms.

96
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:34,051
Ecker is- She's in the waiting room.

97
00:07:37,253 --> 00:07:37,673
Thank you.

98
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:41,496
All right.

99
00:07:41,516 --> 00:07:43,417
I see two on mute.

100
00:07:43,737 --> 00:07:47,320
Deborah Ecker, name and address for the record, please, and you, there you go.

101
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,301
Hi, I'm Deborah Ecker.

102
00:07:49,461 --> 00:07:52,563
I am at 101 Arch Street in Boston.

103
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,084
This is my K.P.

104
00:07:54,164 --> 00:07:54,365
Law.

105
00:07:55,946 --> 00:08:00,349
Okay, if you could please, if you can offer some insight into the settlements that were referenced.

106
00:08:01,978 --> 00:08:12,482
I actually didn't hear the beginning because I just jumped on the first one is a hot is that the one that was one of the ones that was referenced $137,000 and $55,000.

107
00:08:16,445 --> 00:08:17,125
Right, okay.

108
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:22,287
So the 137 is, it was an accident.

109
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:23,407
There is a cap of $200,000.

110
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:25,928
There were two plaintiffs.

111
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,409
Liability is clear.

112
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:34,611
There were admissions that were propounded and responded to by predecessor city solicitor.

113
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:39,492
And so in my opinion, obviously liability was clear.

114
00:08:39,512 --> 00:08:41,513
The damages were clear as well.

115
00:08:42,073 --> 00:08:45,434
So I recommended settlement below the cap.

116
00:08:46,094 --> 00:08:51,096
which I thought was advantageous.

117
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:51,777
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:56,079
Previous city solicitor did something happen to our existing city solicitor that we need to know about.

119
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,700
No, no, no, no, no, not at all.

120
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,442
I'm just when the, the, this is case has been ongoing so in discovery was being exchanged.

121
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:05,523
That's all.

122
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:10,125
Madam President, in my, on my desk today when I came in I found a packet.

123
00:09:11,506 --> 00:09:13,967
And it was provided to us from local 22.

124
00:09:15,217 --> 00:09:17,318
I look at 25 rather and going through it.

125
00:09:18,718 --> 00:09:23,160
It has a number of charges documents.

126
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:36,125
I'm wondering if, you know, based upon the fact that there's $192,000 of overspending in this account right now, and the administration's asking us to transfer that from the fire department public safety to legal.

127
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:44,108
I'm hoping maybe gentlemen that gave us this packet can just give us a brief outline as to what's in it so that we have a better understanding as to what's going on on the side of things.

128
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:47,118
What have been finished men and persons.

129
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,143
Why wasn't the council made to approve the settlements.

130
00:09:56,364 --> 00:10:01,308
Usually, usually the council approves our legal settlements over a certain dollar amounts.

131
00:10:01,428 --> 00:10:03,849
Can you speak to that attorney Ecker or.

132
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:10,374
So for, for the data it's the city solicitor who approves at least the settlement amount.

133
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:12,075
The settlement.

134
00:10:13,176 --> 00:10:14,397
It's a toy was a tort claim.

135
00:10:20,359 --> 00:10:21,600
Council usually approves settlements.

136
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,701
Anything over $2,500, the council has to approve appropriation for.

137
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:27,422
And how many other settlements were made that we didn't approve?

138
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:35,285
Do we have an answer to that?

139
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:36,686
I do not know, not from me.

140
00:10:37,747 --> 00:10:42,729
Okay.

141
00:10:42,749 --> 00:10:44,229
Yeah, that's the normal procedures.

142
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:45,610
City council approves settlements.

143
00:10:48,313 --> 00:10:52,215
No one can answer why those settlements didn't come before the council.

144
00:10:55,177 --> 00:10:57,058
If I can, Councilor Carviel brings up a good point.

145
00:10:57,738 --> 00:11:06,023
If it's 137 for one, and we've always been under the impression that anything over $2,500 comes to this council.

146
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:12,807
And were there any others other than in the past year, other than that 137?

147
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:13,667
Thank you.

148
00:11:14,488 --> 00:11:17,970
Madam Chief of Staff, can you speak to that?

149
00:11:19,962 --> 00:11:25,626
this point in time, I am not aware of any other settlements that require City Council approval or any other settlements for that matter.

150
00:11:26,187 --> 00:11:34,573
I know that there are obviously cases that are pending and going through the process, but I'm not aware of any specific settlements that have been signed and need to be funded at this time.

151
00:11:35,133 --> 00:11:44,801
And can you speak to why these didn't, these, well, I understand you said this 55,000 was previously approved, but the 137,000, do you know why that didn't come to this body?

152
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:48,063
I would have to defer to Council on that.

153
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,120
Okay.

154
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:59,526
On the underlying question, Madam President, if we could just get a review of the packet related to the law line item from- Yeah, I'm not sure I even did that.

155
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:00,747
I don't think I got that packet.

156
00:12:01,448 --> 00:12:02,128
Did I get that packet?

157
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:03,929
The messenger did pass it out.

158
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:05,670
Oh, okay.

159
00:12:05,831 --> 00:12:07,432
It's quite voluminous.

160
00:12:07,892 --> 00:12:08,072
Sure.

161
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:13,076
I mean, I just don't know what- We do have a limit of five minutes.

162
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:14,236
I'm sorry?

163
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:15,837
We have a participant- Five minutes.

164
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:15,918
Yes.

165
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:17,098
You have five minutes, Steve.

166
00:12:22,043 --> 00:12:26,045
Please keep it up to five minutes as that's our, our limiting we have a pack house tonight.

167
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:29,526
They may address for the record, please.

168
00:12:30,407 --> 00:12:33,588
Good evening, Madam President, members of the city council.

169
00:12:33,648 --> 00:12:34,829
My name is Stephen South.

170
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:37,370
I'm the secretary treasurer of teamsters local 25.

171
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,272
And I also live at 106 Damon Road.

172
00:12:41,032 --> 00:12:44,854
So I'm here tonight to speak to you about some items.

173
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:48,476
And first of all, before I begin, I just want to

174
00:12:49,456 --> 00:12:53,958
Thank all of you for all of your hard work during the budget season I know it's a stressful time.

175
00:12:54,338 --> 00:13:02,141
And I also want to recognize all of the hard working teachers in the audience and say that I appreciate that all they do including for my children.

176
00:13:10,988 --> 00:13:28,737
It was brought to my attention that a couple meetings ago that one or more counselors asked the mayor's office for an update on open litigation, much like you're doing tonight, and that the comment was made by the member of the mayor's staff that he doesn't feel comfortable commenting on open litigation.

177
00:13:29,177 --> 00:13:47,041
Well, thankfully, I do feel comfortable commenting on open litigation and not just verbally with my opinions, but I brought you copies of every single litigation that Local 25 has open right now, which is somewhere about between 35 and 40 separate cases.

178
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:50,301
So I briefly just want to give you an overview of those.

179
00:13:50,961 --> 00:13:58,263
So the first little piece here, and I just wanted to talk about money that's been,

180
00:13:59,723 --> 00:14:05,648
spent pretty frivolously within the city when we're talking about budget cuts, getting rid of teachers.

181
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:11,052
We have multiple school custodians, jobs that are not filled.

182
00:14:12,213 --> 00:14:17,978
At the end of March, the city eliminated the security guard position in Medford Public Schools.

183
00:14:18,018 --> 00:14:25,123
There are no longer any security guards in Medford, which I find very troubling with recent things that we see in the news.

184
00:14:25,423 --> 00:14:28,786
But I just want to show you some of these things, the way Medford's spending the money.

185
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:30,768
So first of all, the first packet.

186
00:14:31,088 --> 00:14:44,001
These are private investigator reports, where private investigators are following members of the general of the city employees for that work for the DPW.

187
00:14:44,502 --> 00:14:52,329
And if you look at the first line it says in March of 2021 city of Medford Mayor Brianna Longo Kern became aware of a rumor

188
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,933
that a snowplow driver had been asked to take care of a municipal employee.

189
00:14:57,273 --> 00:15:05,498
So now we're spending tens of thousands of dollars on rumors, and then I'll bring you to the end of the report where, and I'll read the last line.

190
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,159
Now this is after over 40

191
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:14,485
employees and contractors were interviewed by private investigators and people were followed.

192
00:15:14,845 --> 00:15:22,992
This investigation was unable to identify any snow plow driver who offered any information that would corroborate the allegation.

193
00:15:23,332 --> 00:15:31,479
Other than the original rumor, no information was uncovered that indicated a pay to plow scheme exists or existed in Medford.

194
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:33,500
So that was last April.

195
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,041
So what did the city do?

196
00:15:35,121 --> 00:15:36,583
If you look further in the document,

197
00:15:37,223 --> 00:15:41,046
Last fall they started a new investigation on another rumor.

198
00:15:41,486 --> 00:16:00,859
Okay, and you can see that a private investigator or multiple investigators spent basically entire days over the course of many weeks just driving around the city taking pictures, following people, and also affixing secret GPS trackers to people's vehicles.

199
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:03,040
Go to the next document.

200
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:05,062
Now I'll go through the rest quickly.

201
00:16:05,683 --> 00:16:22,537
These three documents are three complaints that we have at the Secretary of State's office for the city, refusing to provide requested information to me both as a taxpayer and also the union, representing many hundreds of employees within the city.

202
00:16:23,546 --> 00:16:33,973
The next is a packet of unfair labor practice charges that Teamsters Local 25 filed at the Massachusetts Department of Labor Relations.

203
00:16:34,413 --> 00:16:46,881
In the last nine months, there's about 25 separate cases, and we'll be hearing all those cases separately, minus a few that were settled, and the city pays an attorney for all those cases and all of those hearings.

204
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:48,182
The next.

205
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:49,644
These are all.

206
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:58,233
These are all AAA arbitration notices, we filed I believe 11 and we have about nine pending.

207
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:09,464
We actually had an arbitration today in the city is paying an astronomical amount to KP law to try all these cases versus me and my attorneys.

208
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:10,986
The next one.

209
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:28,225
Now this is one of the requests for information that the city did provide, not one of the ones that we have complaints on, but if you can see 100% of the information in the documents are redacted so basically they,

210
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:52,323
They gave me blacked out documents and what these are, these are all the city's legal bills, and the city is claiming that it's attorney, attorney client privilege they can't give us the unredacted legal bills because it's private, which we disagree in many communities, including Medford, these were always public record, up until a few years ago, and

211
00:17:53,123 --> 00:18:17,233
The one thing that I do want to point out, and the reason that we think that it is all redacted and I'll tell you because today at arbitration, an official from the city of Medford from the administration testified that KP law hires all these private investigators, and the city reimburses KP law so that's how they get around giving a the information to the union or the general public.

212
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:30,277
Lastly, these are three federal lawsuits that have been filed in the last 12 months against the city of Medford, one of which was just settled in the last few weeks for $475,000.

213
00:18:31,437 --> 00:18:37,438
And I know because it's my members, 34 of my members are being paid that lawsuit.

214
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:42,739
So when the city says they're not aware of any other ones, maybe they should take a look at this.

215
00:18:42,839 --> 00:18:46,720
Maybe the city administration doesn't know of the lawsuits they're paying out

216
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,081
or their attorney that was just speaking, not knowing about other lawsuits.

217
00:18:51,101 --> 00:18:53,542
So that's being dealt directly with the city.

218
00:18:53,882 --> 00:19:15,527
And lastly, and I apologize, I may have went a minute over, but I just wanna say that with the city making all the cuts in the schools, but then spending upwards close to a million dollars on legal fees and settlements and all these other litigations, which about somewhere around 35 to 40 are still pending that you're still going to pay for.

219
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:34,921
I would ask the council to take a hard look at all these items and see if there's ways that they can spend the city's money more fiscally responsible, and maybe figure out why you have all these lawsuits, why you're paying all these settlements, and maybe we can make some positive changes to make it better in the future.

220
00:19:35,221 --> 00:19:37,182
And with that, I thank you for your kind attention.

221
00:19:48,841 --> 00:19:49,601
Thank you, Mr. Scott.

222
00:19:49,681 --> 00:19:50,481
Vice President Behrs.

223
00:19:51,242 --> 00:19:52,182
Thank you, Madam President.

224
00:19:54,462 --> 00:19:54,722
Wow.

225
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,864
That was information I didn't have until right now.

226
00:20:00,684 --> 00:20:04,265
Obviously, gonna read these documents when I have a chance and look into it more.

227
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:17,868
My only question again, so if 137,000 of this is a single settlement and 55,000 is apparently something we've already approved but have to approve again, how much of that money would be going to KP Law is my only question.

228
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:24,534
Attorney Ecker, can you, or Madam Chief of Staff?

229
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,781
Thank you, President Morrell.

230
00:20:31,801 --> 00:20:35,485
$55,000 is the amount to be allocated to KP Law.

231
00:20:35,505 --> 00:20:41,191
Again, this is the amount that was approved by the City Council in, I believe, at its first meeting in January.

232
00:20:41,691 --> 00:20:44,634
Mechanically, it needs to be revoted at this time.

233
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:49,454
Could you just, yeah, that's fine.

234
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:51,515
Could you just explain why that's the mechanics of it for me?

235
00:20:51,835 --> 00:20:52,335
Absolutely.

236
00:20:52,715 --> 00:20:58,057
Once the tax rate is set, the amount can't be raised on the recap.

237
00:20:58,897 --> 00:21:05,720
And based on the timing of that approval, it's not able to be transacted.

238
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,142
The first time that that item came before the city council was obviously when the FY22 budget was presented.

239
00:21:13,782 --> 00:21:15,343
And at the time, once

240
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:26,288
the paper was essentially came before the city council the second time, essentially, at that time, it was past the tax rate being set.

241
00:21:27,229 --> 00:21:27,649
Thank you.

242
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:34,895
And my only other question is, has any additional funding, ARPA funding or other federal funding been used to pay KP law?

243
00:21:35,615 --> 00:21:44,122
Yes, ARPA funding has been used as a mechanism to pay for KP law bills in this same amount.

244
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:52,155
essentially to cover the cost so that we didn't have bills outstanding while we were looking for this transfer.

245
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:54,436
So this money is gonna go back into ARPA?

246
00:21:55,777 --> 00:21:58,419
At this point in time, that's a possible option, yes.

247
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,060
Okay.

248
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,903
Yeah, I mean, thank you for answering the questions.

249
00:22:04,943 --> 00:22:06,665
I have serious concerns about this.

250
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:11,548
I guess, what happens if we were to not approve this or are we, you know,

251
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:15,072
Just kidding, we have a motion to sever out a specific item in these end of year transfers.

252
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:23,199
If you were not to approve this item, then the settlement couldn't obviously be settled upon.

253
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:31,843
And secondly, the city may not be able to make payment on its bills in a timely fashion, because there are also further bills as well.

254
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:44,469
That being said, you know, the city council, I do believe has the discretion, but I would need to confer with either legal or check statutes to confirm to reduce

255
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:48,815
authorizations that are presented, recommendations that are presented.

256
00:22:51,577 --> 00:22:54,199
Has the $55,000 already been expended effectively?

257
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,742
In terms of obligations, yes.

258
00:22:57,562 --> 00:23:13,896
Okay, I would make a motion, one, that we get a listing of any settlements made over $2,500 after July 1, 2021, and have that provided to us since we didn't know about this settlement, and it appears there may be other settlements that haven't come to the council.

259
00:23:19,005 --> 00:23:29,534
And then I would motion to cut the end of year transfer between the fire department and the law department by $55,000, and then approve the end of year transfers.

260
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,137
You want those two separate motions?

261
00:23:34,299 --> 00:23:43,807
Yeah, the first one for the request for the information, the second one to cut 55,000 and then approve the... Still have a few councilors that wanna speak, do I have a second for those motions?

262
00:23:49,383 --> 00:23:58,729
Thank you, Madam President, you know, Council's been asking for the last three years, the bills,

263
00:24:01,116 --> 00:24:04,357
I don't know how many requests have been made, but we haven't gotten any.

264
00:24:04,757 --> 00:24:16,540
I'd like to amend Councilor Baez's motion on the settlements made, not sure, but how many settlements have been made going back the last two years that we don't know about?

265
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:22,902
I know there was others that went through and now, let's see, you got 137, you got, now we're hearing about another 475,000.

266
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:23,282
I remember,

267
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,002
The budget for KP law was said $5,000 a month.

268
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:33,283
That was the budget.

269
00:24:34,303 --> 00:24:39,768
There's other counselors that we had when that was made because we got rid of in-house counsel.

270
00:24:40,528 --> 00:24:43,170
This is exceeding well above that.

271
00:24:43,591 --> 00:24:49,335
And we've never been notified of any spending over the last three years for this law firm.

272
00:24:49,996 --> 00:24:51,537
Again, we keep asking for bills.

273
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:52,578
We keep asking for bills.

274
00:24:52,878 --> 00:24:55,400
You guys keep approving settlements without asking us

275
00:24:57,139 --> 00:24:57,860
I just don't know.

276
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,901
Where's the transparency everybody talks about?

277
00:25:02,482 --> 00:25:04,083
Everybody, transparency, transparency.

278
00:25:04,783 --> 00:25:05,783
We're hiding the stuff.

279
00:25:07,744 --> 00:25:12,547
Sorry, I'm not saying.

280
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:13,967
I'm happy to accept that amendment.

281
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,088
Yeah.

282
00:25:16,128 --> 00:25:19,610
Again, I don't know what to say.

283
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:25,273
Getting told about $137,000 settlement tonight without this council approving settlements is wrong.

284
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:27,167
Councilor Scarapelli.

285
00:25:28,368 --> 00:25:28,688
Thank you.

286
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:30,308
Just one question.

287
00:25:30,328 --> 00:25:45,614
I don't know if it was the KP law attorney or yourself mentioned that, Mr. South, is it true that part of the KP law budget that we're paying for legal representation, that's what pays for the private investigator?

288
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:47,815
Is that coming out of the same line?

289
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:53,077
Thank you, Madam President, if I may, through you to Councilor Scarapelli.

290
00:25:54,309 --> 00:26:09,498
there are circumstances where the city hires outside parties through KP law to conduct matters that are obviously confidential matters of personnel.

291
00:26:10,238 --> 00:26:11,739
And so there

292
00:26:12,298 --> 00:26:13,379
That is a possibility.

293
00:26:13,419 --> 00:26:14,840
Yes, that's the best way I can say it.

294
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:27,250
I will stand before you and I will contend that these bills could compromise and are under attorney-client privilege, the city's position with regard to various matters and issues going on.

295
00:26:28,031 --> 00:26:36,277
I just do want to point back out to the meeting we had with Mr. Silverstein that said that these attorneys are not attorneys for the city of Medford.

296
00:26:37,618 --> 00:26:39,120
These attorneys don't work for the city council.

297
00:26:39,987 --> 00:26:41,948
His attorneys don't work for anybody but the mayor's office.

298
00:26:42,488 --> 00:26:43,488
Their client is the mayor.

299
00:26:44,009 --> 00:26:44,929
That's who their client is.

300
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:47,390
That's where their loyalties lie, not to the taxpayers of this community.

301
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:48,910
He made that clear.

302
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:55,553
He said that.

303
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:59,574
Madam President, a point of information is one that requires a question.

304
00:26:59,855 --> 00:27:01,255
Mr. Knight, what is your question?

305
00:27:02,636 --> 00:27:05,257
How much longer is the lying going to go on?

306
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:06,017
That's my question.

307
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,333
How much longer is the buffaloing going to go on?

308
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:11,434
How much longer are we going to be left in the dock?

309
00:27:11,454 --> 00:27:17,258
And then in the last 11th hour, you come up here and ask us to spend hundreds and hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars.

310
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:18,758
That's my question.

311
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:27,523
I understand your frustration, but I would like to remind you- How much longer do we need to wait for the Warren articles that you requested for three years?

312
00:27:27,583 --> 00:27:31,646
How much longer do we have to wait for the quarterly presentations from the finance director that we've asked for for three years?

313
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:36,313
Those are questions I can ask, too, if those are the questions you were willing and ready to answer.

314
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:39,095
We've been giving you an opportunity now for 36 months to do so.

315
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:43,319
Madam Chief of Staff, I'm not sure what the question is.

316
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:44,820
Thank you, President Morrell.

317
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:45,160
Thank you.

318
00:27:46,641 --> 00:27:48,303
So again, this is where, you know, I know that

319
00:27:52,201 --> 00:27:56,904
Emotions are high because we have so many gaps and so many needs in this community.

320
00:27:57,565 --> 00:28:11,235
And what we're seeing as concerning is that one of the biggest line items is a law department that we've been asking for an understanding where this money is going and no one's told us a thing.

321
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:18,620
Again, I revert back to the first budget meeting we had where I was very concerned

322
00:28:19,473 --> 00:28:24,698
That was very intense and understanding these are the questions that are so frustrating.

323
00:28:25,178 --> 00:28:34,006
When I teach us on afforded reasonable raise pox and shambles our streets and sidewalks are a mess.

324
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:38,350
And then we present a money paper that counts a caveat was correct.

325
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,731
This council voted $5,000.

326
00:28:42,093 --> 00:28:43,874
legal fees for representations a month.

327
00:28:44,034 --> 00:28:46,495
So we looked at that as $60,000.

328
00:28:47,095 --> 00:28:53,098
And we then came in at the beginning of the season, the new term, and we talked with our new counselors.

329
00:28:53,138 --> 00:29:00,281
And unfortunately, we were screaming for a representative that could represent the council legal representation.

330
00:29:00,702 --> 00:29:07,665
And that hasn't happened, which has left us in pretty vulnerable situations that actually afforded us

331
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,504
few negative situations that came out legally, because we didn't have the representation.

332
00:29:14,985 --> 00:29:18,447
And we've asked over and over again.

333
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:25,993
And I believe the council was promised legal representation of this council if that paper was voted on, I believe.

334
00:29:26,453 --> 00:29:28,935
And as we look at the budget, we don't have that.

335
00:29:28,995 --> 00:29:30,957
So correct that that hasn't been added.

336
00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:45,879
President Morrell, my recollection differs from yours, Councilor Scarapelli, but I do recall specifically that City Council making its comments with regard to wanting to see legal representation.

337
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:54,783
I also will say that, reiterate my comments from back then, there's a tremendous, this is a $200 million corporation.

338
00:29:56,284 --> 00:30:01,607
You all, through the city, as the legislative body for the city,

339
00:30:03,286 --> 00:30:08,168
The mayor of this city runs a $200 million corporation.

340
00:30:09,669 --> 00:30:13,310
We need to have special counsel for special purposes.

341
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:15,131
It is critically important.

342
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:23,615
There is no one general counsel who can represent or assistant counsel that can represent all the needs of a $200 million corporation.

343
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:29,938
I'm not sure if I used those words when we spoke last on this matter, but that is the reality that I want to present to you again.

344
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:36,319
that it's important that we have the depth and the knowledge to properly represent the city on various matters that come up.

345
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:40,300
And they're not all going to be ones that general counsel can take on.

346
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:54,882
And I'll say this again, like I said the other evening, normal and other communities, counselors and the CEO of their communities work together to find solutions to make our city succeed.

347
00:30:56,162 --> 00:30:58,443
So it's not, this is the problem.

348
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,618
This is a blaring problem.

349
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:03,799
It's just not the mayor who's running the CEO of this community.

350
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:05,239
We understand that.

351
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,900
If there was give and taken, we understood, but there isn't.

352
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:13,021
This body has been disrespected time after time.

353
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:18,603
You're coming to us with information that we've been asking for for months, if not years.

354
00:31:19,383 --> 00:31:28,885
And then we have to, we have to, under pressure, vote it through so we can run the business of our administration.

355
00:31:30,344 --> 00:31:36,766
So it falls on deaf ears when it's a plea that the mayor needs this for all this work.

356
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:40,167
So do we.

357
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:44,048
We're hired to follow the ordinance and laws of this community.

358
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:47,910
And we need that assistance to make sure that we can help this community grow.

359
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:57,893
So again, like I said, if we work together, like was promised, and if we shared our failures and shared our successes together,

360
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:02,751
we could have a lot of great things happen in this community, but instead we're here.

361
00:32:04,152 --> 00:32:04,492
Thank you.

362
00:32:04,912 --> 00:32:14,297
President Morales, I'm not gonna rebut the items Councilor Scarapelli stated and Councilor Scarapelli, I don't materially disagree with you.

363
00:32:14,457 --> 00:32:15,918
The only one thing I will point out.

364
00:32:16,698 --> 00:32:29,653
is that matters pertaining to personnel and legal matters are ones that the city has an obligation to be cautious very very cautious on it is something it is a position I have taken for the last decade in administration.

365
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:33,737
And it is not it is I can't speak to what other communities do.

366
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,960
And frankly, I don't even know if this community.

367
00:32:37,341 --> 00:32:39,061
took that position before I started here.

368
00:32:39,141 --> 00:32:45,683
But it's important that we ensure the privacy and ensure that you all, unfortunately, are a public body.

369
00:32:46,383 --> 00:32:54,484
By your being a public body, information that is provided to you as a public body is then becoming a public record.

370
00:32:54,884 --> 00:32:57,545
And it's important legally from that perspective.

371
00:32:57,865 --> 00:33:02,546
I don't disagree with you, Councilor Scarapelli, on the other matters that we can share successes.

372
00:33:03,326 --> 00:33:04,746
And frankly, I can do a better job at that.

373
00:33:05,786 --> 00:33:11,970
I'll just leave it at that, but I and I'm gonna, I'll end with this, and I, we understand.

374
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:21,636
We're not naive not to understand that we're a public body and understanding that the confidentiality rules, but that still doesn't

375
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:29,934
allow the administration not to meet with us on understanding what the monies, how much money and where it's going.

376
00:33:29,954 --> 00:33:31,254
It doesn't have to be the person's name.

377
00:33:31,274 --> 00:33:36,136
It doesn't have to be the situation, but understanding the process, that's all we're asking for.

378
00:33:36,436 --> 00:33:47,200
So we could understand that because when we hear things and we sit here like nights like tonight, we're given things, it would be nice to understand that what Mr. South presented

379
00:33:48,858 --> 00:34:08,852
They're names all over this, and maybe that's right or wrong, but if we sat with our administration in executive session and explained to us where our money was going and what situation without the person's name, that doesn't affect any kind of privacy issues.

380
00:34:09,272 --> 00:34:10,513
So that's all I'm saying.

381
00:34:11,093 --> 00:34:11,614
So thank you.

382
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:12,134
Thank you.

383
00:34:12,354 --> 00:34:13,055
President Paris.

384
00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:14,335
Thank you, Madam President.

385
00:34:16,037 --> 00:34:18,078
I mean, if we're gonna use a corporation analogy,

386
00:34:18,939 --> 00:34:27,041
I can't think of any $200 million corporation where the board, the legislature would just say, the chief executive officer could do whatever they want.

387
00:34:27,081 --> 00:34:28,161
We don't need to know what's going on.

388
00:34:28,982 --> 00:34:30,122
I just don't think that would happen.

389
00:34:30,142 --> 00:34:37,904
I would just ask that we, unless there's additional comment, that we vote on these motions.

390
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:45,586
And I again, happily accept Councilor Scarpelli's amendment to go back all the way to January 1, 2020 regarding settlements

391
00:34:49,186 --> 00:34:49,406
over $2,500.

392
00:34:49,606 --> 00:34:55,990
Mr. South, we do have a rule that you can only speak once on a topic.

393
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:57,851
We're just going to try to move through.

394
00:34:57,971 --> 00:34:58,292
Thank you.

395
00:34:59,792 --> 00:35:01,854
So we have too much on the floor from Vice Mayor Behrs.

396
00:35:01,874 --> 00:35:03,535
Is there any further discussion from the council?

397
00:35:04,695 --> 00:35:08,478
Is there any from the public who would like to speak on this who has not spoken yet?

398
00:35:08,538 --> 00:35:10,159
I have a question.

399
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,340
Why are we giving parking another $100,000?

400
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,578
We have close to a million dollar budget.

401
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:32,040
President Morrell through you to Councilor Caravaglio, this would be for the prior, the current fiscal year, not the fiscal year that begins July one.

402
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:37,761
It's, as you may recall, their budget was only $250,000 in salaries and $100,000 for fiscal 22 in ordinary expenses.

403
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,662
The city council did approve a transfer for $45,000

404
00:35:48,344 --> 00:35:51,446
for salaries but again the salaries really begin half the year.

405
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:57,670
So this is getting closer to a more representative budget for what's presented before the city council for fiscal 23.

406
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:02,473
Again, this this paper is this transfer is only for fiscal 22.

407
00:36:02,573 --> 00:36:07,916
Any further discussion from the council.

408
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:13,703
Two motions on the floor from Vice President Behrs.

409
00:36:14,144 --> 00:36:26,046
So the first one as amended by Councilor Carviello, request from the administration, any settlements over $2,500 from the past year, and that was amended by Councilor Carviello to go to the past two years, correct?

410
00:36:27,326 --> 00:36:27,946
January 1, 2020, okay.

411
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:31,347
Do I have a second on that motion?

412
00:36:33,027 --> 00:36:33,867
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

413
00:36:37,607 --> 00:36:40,949
So on the motion of Vice President Behrs, as amended by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Night.

414
00:36:40,989 --> 00:36:41,670
All those in favor?

415
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,150
All those opposed?

416
00:36:44,031 --> 00:36:44,671
Motion passes.

417
00:36:44,751 --> 00:36:52,997
So the second motion is to cut the transfer line of the fire department personnel to the law department, which the original amount is $192,000.

418
00:36:53,037 --> 00:36:57,019
Vice President Behrs has motion to cut that by $55,000.

419
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,261
Does that motion have a second?

420
00:36:59,941 --> 00:37:01,182
Seconded by Councilor Collins.

421
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:03,403
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

422
00:37:05,945 --> 00:37:06,305
It's a money.

423
00:37:08,344 --> 00:37:10,125
President wrong, if I may really quickly.

424
00:37:10,805 --> 00:37:23,509
I just want to make one last comment about this subject and that is just, I know the city council knows, but the city council has been utilizing the services of KP law for a number of ordinances over the course of the past fiscal year.

425
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:28,271
This ultimately is paying for those resources that were allocated.

426
00:37:28,951 --> 00:37:31,192
That's, that's the only thing I'll mention here right and right now.

427
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:31,572
Thank you.

428
00:37:33,341 --> 00:37:36,324
President, this is I've been here 11 years.

429
00:37:36,684 --> 00:37:37,925
This is unprecedented.

430
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:44,391
The amount of legal work that's had to go into this unprecedented and all the mayors that have been there.

431
00:37:44,591 --> 00:37:51,376
I don't think I don't think we've ever had 40 lawsuits against the city in one term or term.

432
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:53,558
However, well along this this encompasses.

433
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:55,280
This is totally unacceptable.

434
00:37:56,553 --> 00:38:04,676
President Morrell, through you to Councilor Caravaglio, please do not conflate lawsuits and alleged unfair labor practices.

435
00:38:04,996 --> 00:38:07,017
They're alleged unfair labor practices.

436
00:38:07,057 --> 00:38:15,160
If you look through those documents, there will be some, if those documents are unredacted, you will look through those documents and you will find some just as comical as I do.

437
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:23,463
Again, I have an essay, I just got this tonight and I'm quite upset that I don't know about 40 lawsuits happening in the city of Memphis.

438
00:38:23,503 --> 00:38:24,884
Again, please do not conflate the two.

439
00:38:27,108 --> 00:38:28,028
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

440
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,031
Vice President Behrs.

441
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,192
Yes.

442
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,073
Councilor Kerrio.

443
00:38:34,113 --> 00:38:34,333
Yes.

444
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:36,034
Councilor Collins.

445
00:38:36,235 --> 00:38:36,435
Yes.

446
00:38:37,616 --> 00:38:38,096
Councilor Knight.

447
00:38:38,256 --> 00:38:38,476
Yes.

448
00:38:39,177 --> 00:38:39,757
Councilor Scarpelli.

449
00:38:39,797 --> 00:38:39,937
Yes.

450
00:38:41,058 --> 00:38:41,599
Councilor Sang.

451
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:41,879
Yes.

452
00:38:42,399 --> 00:38:42,960
President Morrell.

453
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:43,340
Yes.

454
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,481
Seven in favor, zero in the negative.

455
00:38:44,501 --> 00:38:45,362
The motion passes.

456
00:38:45,402 --> 00:38:46,823
Do I have a motion on the main paper?

457
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,524
Motion approved.

458
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,187
On the motion of Vice President Behrs to approve the main paper seconded by

459
00:38:53,827 --> 00:38:55,808
Councillor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

460
00:39:19,708 --> 00:39:21,590
This is the yes, yes.

461
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,995
So the motion is to approve the main paper, minus the cost we just voted for.

462
00:39:28,558 --> 00:39:29,258
Vice President Bears.

463
00:39:29,399 --> 00:39:29,699
Yes.

464
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,461
Councilor Kerrio.

465
00:39:32,562 --> 00:39:33,163
Councilor Collins.

466
00:39:33,283 --> 00:39:33,503
Yes.

467
00:39:34,224 --> 00:39:34,684
Councilor Knight.

468
00:39:34,884 --> 00:39:35,105
Yes.

469
00:39:35,845 --> 00:39:36,526
Councilor Scripp-Kelley.

470
00:39:36,766 --> 00:39:36,927
Yes.

471
00:39:37,788 --> 00:39:38,288
Councilor Sang.

472
00:39:38,408 --> 00:39:38,628
Yes.

473
00:39:39,369 --> 00:39:39,850
President Morrell.

474
00:39:40,121 --> 00:39:57,486
Yes, seven firms here in the negative emotion passes to dash 423 to the honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding use of retained earnings your present morale and members of the City Council I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body, approve the appropriation of retained earnings and the amount of $500,000 and zero cents the amount is being

475
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:16,517
Requested to subsidize the fiscal year 2023 water and sewer enterprise fund budget retained earnings are reserves of the water and sewer fund reserves can be used for any lawful purpose but serve primarily to provide financial security in cases of unforeseen events or to reduce the need for additional revenue from increased water and sewer rates.

476
00:40:16,577 --> 00:40:21,740
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter since daily Brianna Longo Kern Mayor, Madam President want to know that we did get

477
00:40:22,512 --> 00:40:26,175
an attempted amendment by the mayor on this paper.

478
00:40:26,255 --> 00:40:31,619
Unfortunately, because it was not posted on the agenda, and we can't amend the money paper on the spot.

479
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:34,001
She would have to come back with that amendment.

480
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:42,247
I would motion to table this pending a resubmission at our July meeting on the motion of vice president bears to table second by counselor night.

481
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:45,960
Madam Chair is undebatable.

482
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,162
Yeah, I mean, it's the motion table is undebatable.

483
00:40:49,222 --> 00:40:52,625
I mean, if you have something, Dr. Dickinson, that's gonna inform us, but.

484
00:40:54,246 --> 00:40:59,509
Information wise, retained earnings expire as of June 30th.

485
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:10,837
So if we don't vote any now, we don't vote any until we recertify retained earnings, which hopefully will be this fall.

486
00:41:10,917 --> 00:41:12,979
It won't be next June.

487
00:41:13,912 --> 00:41:20,516
but you will not be able to use retained earnings to subsidize the rents.

488
00:41:20,536 --> 00:41:21,537
I withdraw my motion.

489
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:30,303
Mr. Dickinson, we received a, I've withdrawn the motion to table, but we received a message requesting an amendment to 750,000.

490
00:41:30,843 --> 00:41:34,165
We can't do that because it's been submitted as a money paper at 500,000, we can't amend it.

491
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:34,926
So if we approve 500,000.

492
00:41:34,966 --> 00:41:37,607
Yeah, we'll vote for 500.

493
00:41:42,292 --> 00:41:47,977
I just want to understand how that affects the plans, considering that the number was changed after the agenda deadline.

494
00:41:49,719 --> 00:42:02,210
If I may propose through you, President Morrell, that we table this until towards the end, we can get legal counsel on to confirm or deny the comment about not being able to amend it here and right now.

495
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:08,636
I do think that it is possible, and it was within your means, but let's double check with counsel because this is a timing issue.

496
00:42:09,867 --> 00:42:21,999
This, this, let me also further add that as finance finance director Dickinson stated this $500,000 obviously is to maintain and reduce the water and sewer rates.

497
00:42:22,812 --> 00:42:35,341
It's being recommended at a higher amount, both by the Water and Sewer Commission, which occurred after the posting of this agenda, as well as the mayor and other certain key officials.

498
00:42:35,902 --> 00:42:49,232
The mayor, when we researched the subject, in order to have the city council vote a higher number, which we learned recently, that higher number would have to be voted, would have to be recommended by the mayor.

499
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:50,613
So that is what's before you.

500
00:42:51,793 --> 00:42:52,234
Councilor Knight.

501
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:57,050
Why can't we just approve the 500, and then when they certify the retained earnings, come back in the fall and do the other 250?

502
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:02,552
Are you able to address that question, why we can't vote through the 500,000?

503
00:43:05,313 --> 00:43:09,835
If I may, when I met with the Water Commission about this, that's not still on.

504
00:43:21,202 --> 00:43:27,827
When I met with the Water Commission about setting rates and recommendations for retained earnings.

505
00:43:28,868 --> 00:43:38,316
I was under the impression that $500,000 would keep the rates at pretty much what the increase in the budget is which is roughly 3%.

506
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:56,260
The consultant from Raftelis who sets the water rates once the budget and the retained earnings subsidy is given to him said they gave me basically four different scenarios.

507
00:43:58,342 --> 00:44:02,684
With a $500,000 retained earnings subsidy.

508
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:13,147
We're looking at a 5.25% rate increase which means the average residential customer will pay approximately $6 more per month.

509
00:44:14,788 --> 00:44:18,389
We go to 750 it's four and a quarter and then they'll pay $5 more per month.

510
00:44:20,392 --> 00:44:27,517
per month, the million dollars would be three and a quarter and roughly 350, 375 per month.

511
00:44:28,538 --> 00:44:37,304
So in order to keep it closer to what the rate increases have been historically,

512
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:42,195
We sat down and the mayor said probably 750 would be good.

513
00:44:42,975 --> 00:44:50,899
The sewer commission, I mean, the water commission had wanted to go as high as a million dollars to keep it at three and a quarter percent.

514
00:44:52,020 --> 00:45:04,187
Again, monthly, every dollar matters, obviously, but it's not, we're not talking 20, $30 a month, we're talking somewhere between four and $8 a month, depending on what this council votes.

515
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:11,300
So yes, we could certainly just go with $500,000 in retained earnings.

516
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:16,685
That's what before you now, I believe it's perfectly acceptable for you to up that to $750,000.

517
00:45:16,805 --> 00:45:19,948
Just informationally, retained earnings this year were $8.7 million.

518
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:22,650
If we use 750,000, it would be around $8 million.

519
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:40,402
left and retained earnings, that's a reasonably healthy amount to have as reserves for your water sewer enterprise fund.

520
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:48,085
That would probably be around 30% of the yearly budget, which is healthy.

521
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,626
Many communities have much less.

522
00:45:50,066 --> 00:45:51,927
The consultant had said that

523
00:45:53,031 --> 00:46:01,314
Having over 25% is, there's no actual studies out there to say what it should be, but 25% and more is a good number.

524
00:46:01,414 --> 00:46:09,157
So it's really, if it's 500,000, it's 500,000, and the rates will go up by five and a quarter percent.

525
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:11,458
At least that's what I'm being told now.

526
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:19,302
But then after the retained earnings get certified in the fall, can you come back and request an additional 250,000 and then provide that additional rate?

527
00:46:21,232 --> 00:46:27,081
Well, I'm not exactly sure how that would work because we have to set the rates.

528
00:46:27,302 --> 00:46:36,296
So we're making, I don't know that we can set rates assuming that we'll come back in the fall and have another quarter of a million dollars in retained earnings.

529
00:46:39,057 --> 00:46:43,460
That's, that's the problem that, you know, it's not going to spend a million.

530
00:46:44,361 --> 00:46:49,264
Well, I know, but earnings in three months, or maybe the way things are going.

531
00:46:50,065 --> 00:46:52,186
No, no, no, no, no, that's not happening.

532
00:46:54,838 --> 00:47:01,083
But again, we can't set the rates based on the assumption that this council will vote.

533
00:47:01,223 --> 00:47:24,002
So right now, the only option we have is to either vote this paper through with $500,000 or table it until such time as the chief of staff can get the legal advice that this council has been asking for to have here during these meetings to get a determination as to whether or not the mayor's allowed to amend the paper for $250,000 on the floor the night of the meeting after it's been proposed.

534
00:47:25,733 --> 00:47:29,095
The amendment actually hasn't been submitted because we've got an email.

535
00:47:29,235 --> 00:47:30,015
This is a memo.

536
00:47:30,035 --> 00:47:31,356
This is not an official paper.

537
00:47:31,376 --> 00:47:31,776
It's a memo.

538
00:47:31,816 --> 00:47:33,137
I would move to approve 500,000.

539
00:47:33,237 --> 00:47:38,160
On the motion of Vice President Behrs to approve the original amendment.

540
00:47:46,526 --> 00:47:52,688
I just want to make the point, it's not necessarily that we're, you know, opposed to something, it's a procedure problem.

541
00:47:52,768 --> 00:47:56,169
It's a, we just can't, we can't amend a money paper.

542
00:47:56,189 --> 00:47:57,670
It's a lot of procedure problems.

543
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:05,072
It's a procedure problem and it's just, we got this update in our email.

544
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,693
It's not something that's been publicly posted.

545
00:48:06,733 --> 00:48:08,053
People aren't able to speak on it.

546
00:48:08,714 --> 00:48:09,394
Exactly, right.

547
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:13,121
just wanted to be any further discussion for the council.

548
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:18,384
I just want to be adamantly clear that I'm 110% favor of water sewer rate relief.

549
00:48:19,024 --> 00:48:20,405
I mean, that's what the retained earnings are flawed.

550
00:48:20,425 --> 00:48:21,625
That's what we should be doing with this money.

551
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:26,288
Keep a healthy amount of reserves and then get the money back to the taxpayer, the back to the ratepayer for relief.

552
00:48:26,348 --> 00:48:27,708
I certainly think that this is the way to go.

553
00:48:28,229 --> 00:48:34,952
The question is just when can we follow the proper mechanism to do it so that we don't find ourselves in a financial situation or a legal situation.

554
00:48:38,352 --> 00:48:45,526
On the motion of vice president bears to approve the original amount before a seconded by counter Carviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

555
00:48:46,247 --> 00:48:46,588
Yes.

556
00:48:48,271 --> 00:48:48,472
Yes.

557
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:55,521
Yes.

558
00:48:56,882 --> 00:49:14,653
Yes, seven in front of zero negative the motion passes to two dash four to four to honorable president and members of the Medford City Council regarding these casino community impact funds for fiscal year 2023 budget your president morale and members of the city council I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate $135,247 and zero cents and casino community impact funds for the FY 23 budget

559
00:49:20,317 --> 00:49:31,744
to fund a staff transportation engineer position and motor vehicle garage repairman me oh three in the DPW this request is in compliance with the Medford and when casino surrounding community impact agreement, thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

560
00:49:32,304 --> 00:49:33,685
Sincerely, Mayor.

561
00:49:36,647 --> 00:49:45,392
Any discussion on this paper from the Council, Madam President, the way I'm reading it is that this paper is in accord with the surrounding agreement with when casino, which would mean that

562
00:49:46,163 --> 00:49:53,229
They're telling us we have to hire a motor vehicle graduate payment and a transportation engineer, or is this positions that were negotiated through this agreement?

563
00:49:53,249 --> 00:49:54,190
Maybe someone could elaborate.

564
00:49:55,592 --> 00:50:06,161
Are these positions something that we said, you know, when the casino gets open, we want you to fund these positions for the city of Medford annually, or is it a direct appropriation of money that they give us that we then turn and spend however we see fit?

565
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:12,027
Madam Chair and staff, there are seats in front too, so you don't have to keep going all the way.

566
00:50:14,767 --> 00:50:15,047
Thank you.

567
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:16,188
The exercise is good for me.

568
00:50:16,228 --> 00:50:16,809
Thank you, President.

569
00:50:17,529 --> 00:50:21,473
I'm actually going to defer to Finance Director Dickinson on this.

570
00:50:22,073 --> 00:50:27,017
And I didn't, I wasn't able to hear some of your comments, Councilor Knight, so if you'd be so willing to.

571
00:50:27,598 --> 00:50:27,878
Absolutely.

572
00:50:27,898 --> 00:50:33,263
I'm just wondering if this agreement dictates that these are the funds, these are where the funds need to be paid.

573
00:50:33,543 --> 00:50:39,468
When you read this, the language of it says that these appropriations are in accord with or in compliance with the Medford and Winn Casino surrounding

574
00:50:40,026 --> 00:50:41,047
Community Impact Agreement.

575
00:50:41,067 --> 00:50:48,114
So does that agreement say that when we'll fund an annual transportation engineer and an annual MEO3?

576
00:50:48,274 --> 00:50:52,818
Or does it say that they'll provide us with funds that we can use in a discretionary fashion when we see fit?

577
00:50:58,233 --> 00:51:09,801
My understanding is that a transfer like this to fund these positions has to be in accordance with what the community impact agreement is.

578
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:15,004
We don't have to transfer the funds, but that's what we're putting in the budget.

579
00:51:15,064 --> 00:51:20,208
That's a funding source that we will be using to fund these positions in fiscal 2023.

580
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:24,451
So the agreement with Wynn says that we can use these funds for anything.

581
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:26,332
We're choosing to use them for these two positions.

582
00:51:27,107 --> 00:51:37,972
I haven't read the agreement with when or the community impact agreement or gone through it with a fine tooth comb, I would assume there there are certain purposes that we can use these funds for.

583
00:51:38,673 --> 00:51:39,593
And these are some of them.

584
00:51:43,655 --> 00:51:50,298
Motion to approve on the motion of ice and bears to approve seconded by Councillor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

585
00:51:57,538 --> 00:51:57,838
Yes.

586
00:51:57,858 --> 00:51:57,918
Yes.

587
00:51:59,099 --> 00:51:59,279
Yes.

588
00:52:11,617 --> 00:52:14,559
Yes, five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes.

589
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:21,783
22-425, to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding cemetery perpetual care for fiscal year 2023 budget.

590
00:52:21,843 --> 00:52:37,050
Dear President Morrell and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body appropriate $199,958.64 in cemetery perpetual care funds for the FY23 budget to fund the cemetery ordinary expense budget.

591
00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:38,891
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

592
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:40,332
Sincerely, Brenna Langerford, Mayor.

593
00:52:42,767 --> 00:52:43,568
Any discussion on this paper?

594
00:52:43,588 --> 00:52:44,529
Vice President Behrs.

595
00:52:45,009 --> 00:52:48,332
Whereas this is a standard process that we do every year, I'd move to approve.

596
00:52:49,313 --> 00:52:54,117
Any further discussion from the council on the motion of Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

597
00:52:54,157 --> 00:52:55,238
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

598
00:53:20,153 --> 00:53:20,374
Yes.

599
00:53:20,434 --> 00:53:20,614
Yes.

600
00:53:20,654 --> 00:53:20,895
Yes.

601
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,623
Yes, seven in favor, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

602
00:53:34,643 --> 00:53:48,589
22-426, the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, dear President Morrell and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the appropriation of one free cash in the amount of $305,000 and zero cents to purchase the following items.

603
00:53:48,609 --> 00:53:51,490
$165,000 to purchase three hybrid police cruisers for the police department.

604
00:53:55,872 --> 00:54:08,299
$90,000 for the groundwater remediation project at 448 High Street and $50,000 to replace funding in the recreation revolving account which was used to make payment to the Department of Conservation and Recreation for five years worth of lease payments at the La Conte rink.

605
00:54:08,859 --> 00:54:10,700
The balance of free cash before this vote is $15,625,799.

606
00:54:14,842 --> 00:54:20,045
Two, retain earnings from the water enterprise in the amount of $220,000.00 to purchase the following items.

607
00:54:20,065 --> 00:54:26,289
$140,000.00 for a six-wheel dump truck for DPW Water Division and $80,000.00 for a small one-ton dump truck with plow for the DPW Water Division.

608
00:54:32,173 --> 00:54:36,095
The balance retained earnings in the water enterprise before this vote is $8,712,776.

609
00:54:36,415 --> 00:54:49,621
The following department heads will be available to answer any questions believe Chief Jack Buckley, DPW Commissioner Tim McGibbon, Superintendent of Equipment Mike Wenzel and Recreation Director, Kevin Bailey respectfully submitted Brianna Longo current mayor.

610
00:54:51,722 --> 00:54:54,523
So any questions from the counselor or the department heads like to come up.

611
00:54:55,363 --> 00:54:58,445
I'd like to sever the police cruisers from the rest of the paper of course.

612
00:54:59,488 --> 00:55:03,249
on the motion of Councilor Knight to sever the police cruisers for the rest of the papers.

613
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:04,869
I have a second on that motion.

614
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:05,569
Second.

615
00:55:05,949 --> 00:55:07,229
Second by Vice President Behrs.

616
00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:07,990
All those in favor?

617
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:09,030
Aye.

618
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,290
All those opposed?

619
00:55:10,590 --> 00:55:11,330
Motion passes.

620
00:55:11,390 --> 00:55:12,630
The paper is severed.

621
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:18,011
Madam President, we'll for approval or $165,000 to purchase a three new hybrid police cruisers to the police department.

622
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:20,172
I do have a question.

623
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:21,552
Councilor Scott Kelly.

624
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:26,913
I know that she, we, this is, I know that,

625
00:55:28,631 --> 00:55:32,614
We had some difficult times in the budget and presentations.

626
00:55:32,694 --> 00:55:46,106
I know that we just received the official budget just the other day, but I was under the impression that there wasn't anything in the budget for the cruisers and then the groundwater remediation.

627
00:55:46,126 --> 00:55:51,710
I don't, is that something that just happened recently?

628
00:55:52,951 --> 00:55:53,472
Chief, is that?

629
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,193
Do you want to speak on the cruisers chief?

630
00:55:56,213 --> 00:56:04,735
Because we're also talking about hybrid vehicles and would we be capable of having the hybrid vehicle with the docking stations and everything like that?

631
00:56:04,775 --> 00:56:06,795
Well, it's hybrid and EV.

632
00:56:08,595 --> 00:56:09,176
Right, right.

633
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:10,476
Sorry.

634
00:56:10,496 --> 00:56:11,576
Hold on a second.

635
00:56:11,656 --> 00:56:12,456
I missed a question.

636
00:56:12,496 --> 00:56:13,136
That's on now.

637
00:56:13,256 --> 00:56:15,137
No, I just, you're good.

638
00:56:15,317 --> 00:56:18,057
During the regular budget meeting, was this known?

639
00:56:18,077 --> 00:56:22,278
Because I thought we asked, when we asked the fleet if we're adding more police cruisers.

640
00:56:24,138 --> 00:56:29,683
I thought that, so there was a question at the debate on police cruises, but it has been like my entire career.

641
00:56:29,703 --> 00:56:32,885
We've never funded police cruises through the normal police budget.

642
00:56:32,945 --> 00:56:34,847
It's always been done outside of that.

643
00:56:35,847 --> 00:56:39,530
That's 24 or 25 years, in my knowledge.

644
00:56:40,952 --> 00:56:41,192
All right.

645
00:56:41,252 --> 00:56:42,032
I know that.

646
00:56:42,693 --> 00:56:43,153
Thank you, Chief.

647
00:56:43,173 --> 00:56:43,574
That's all.

648
00:56:43,594 --> 00:56:45,055
That's a great question.

649
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:47,737
And then I know that the recreation,

650
00:56:49,918 --> 00:57:00,515
Mr Bailey could just give us a description of the 50,000 for because I, this is this is the only piece that with the recreation quick question.

651
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:05,397
Recreation is a revolving account.

652
00:57:05,617 --> 00:57:09,040
The only way that it survives is a revolving account.

653
00:57:09,601 --> 00:57:13,786
So when you take $50,000, it's going to hurt us.

654
00:57:13,966 --> 00:57:20,333
So if you just explain just real quick with that, just elaborate what that means with DCRA.

655
00:57:20,753 --> 00:57:22,855
I understand, but I think that as we

656
00:57:23,955 --> 00:57:29,517
In my capacity, we pay DCR for our ranks too, so if you just elaborate so people can understand what happened here.

657
00:57:30,337 --> 00:57:38,580
Yeah, so what happened is, as everyone is aware, this year we took over the operations of Laconie Rank.

658
00:57:39,441 --> 00:57:50,925
One of the first things starting back in September was reading the contract between the city and DCR on the use of the facility.

659
00:57:51,874 --> 00:58:08,243
One of the things that we've heard routinely and one of the things that we were really pressing on right in the beginning with DCR is figuring out who those point of contact people are, and to also make sure that they are also helping us out with the upkeep of the facility.

660
00:58:08,884 --> 00:58:14,207
We know there are certain things that needed to be done in the hockey rink and we want to see that DCR is able to

661
00:58:15,157 --> 00:58:15,878
meet those needs.

662
00:58:16,999 --> 00:58:23,264
When we started those discussions, one of the things that we did learn is that the contract with the city and DCR was just about to expire.

663
00:58:23,284 --> 00:58:32,411
And we learned that there was actually $75,000 that the city owed DCR on the lease.

664
00:58:32,511 --> 00:58:34,893
The administration was able to talk with DCR.

665
00:58:35,453 --> 00:58:40,417
We brought the amount down to $50,000 and we wanted to pay that as quickly as possible.

666
00:58:41,161 --> 00:58:43,922
Seeing that there was money in the recreation revolving accounts.

667
00:58:44,682 --> 00:58:52,986
We wanted to very quickly pay that lease and to be able to renew that contract as quickly as possible but also to use that as leverage for DC.

668
00:58:53,960 --> 00:59:00,102
to do the different repairs that you guys have seen this year, such as doing the roof over and insulating the rink.

669
00:59:01,043 --> 00:59:03,744
So that money was taken under the Recreation Revolving Account.

670
00:59:04,184 --> 00:59:08,005
Laconi Rink does have its own separate revolving account as well.

671
00:59:09,105 --> 00:59:15,048
So the request now is to take money from free cash and put it back into the Recreation Revolving Account.

672
00:59:15,488 --> 00:59:21,350
Okay, so the rink is an enterprise account for revolving.

673
00:59:22,074 --> 00:59:30,184
Sorry enterprise enterprise account Okay, so, so this was this what this this isn't wasn't your, you didn't know about this until you took it over.

674
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:31,025
Correct.

675
00:59:31,306 --> 00:59:34,390
So, if anybody can anybody tell us what the city.

676
00:59:36,102 --> 00:59:41,104
How was, how did we lag and paying this for the last five years, prior to recreation taking it over.

677
00:59:41,564 --> 00:59:53,629
Do you know who's doing that, I can for certain give the answers to that as you know it was the first year that we took this operation over, I can say that it was a struggle working with DC are getting the

678
00:59:54,247 --> 01:00:05,523
invoice ourselves so that we could pay the contract to get the point person for other things that are needed into the rank and we're still working with DCR on things like our cooling tower to be replaced.

679
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:08,427
So moving forward, this payment will not come straight out of the

680
01:00:09,399 --> 01:00:12,981
It should be coming out of the rank revolving out of the enterprise enterprise account.

681
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:13,201
Sorry.

682
01:00:13,301 --> 01:00:13,661
All right.

683
01:00:14,041 --> 01:00:18,263
All right, but that 50 $50,000 is you're going to be, you're going to be able to recover that 50,000 because I know

684
01:00:27,538 --> 01:00:33,904
If we're taking that, you're okay with your programming and... So on a new contract each year, we should be paying it.

685
01:00:33,944 --> 01:00:37,848
So it shouldn't be a five year, one loan sum, we should be paying it each year.

686
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:40,150
Right, but this came out of this year's account, correct?

687
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:40,150
$50,000?

688
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:41,772
Correct, all five years.

689
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,655
But it came out of the recreation revolving.

690
01:00:44,835 --> 01:00:45,075
Correct.

691
01:00:45,095 --> 01:00:49,820
So my question is, are you okay financially by taking $50,000 out of your account?

692
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:56,449
Our rock revolving account, right now we are clearly spending more money than what we're taking in.

693
01:00:57,189 --> 01:01:04,531
So if we approve the 50,000 to go back into our account, we will have about 220,000.

694
01:01:04,591 --> 01:01:11,813
So we do need it because we have so many free programs that we're trying to do, free team programming.

695
01:01:12,933 --> 01:01:18,254
So without that- I gotta tell you, you're doing a lot with little, and I appreciate it.

696
01:01:18,394 --> 01:01:20,555
I mean, the pond and the pool is great.

697
01:01:23,819 --> 01:01:25,861
I see the partnerships all over the city.

698
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:34,150
What you're doing together with different entities in the community, I think exactly what makes the recreation department so successful.

699
01:01:34,731 --> 01:01:38,095
And I commend you and your team of, I believe, three.

700
01:01:39,937 --> 01:01:40,638
By the way, I have 12.

701
01:01:41,754 --> 01:01:43,375
just so everybody knows my department.

702
01:01:43,975 --> 01:01:44,915
So, but thank you.

703
01:01:45,055 --> 01:01:45,935
He's in another city.

704
01:01:46,135 --> 01:01:47,076
I'm in another city, correct.

705
01:01:47,096 --> 01:01:47,456
Thank you.

706
01:01:47,896 --> 01:01:48,236
Thank you.

707
01:01:48,416 --> 01:01:49,696
Councilor Carvio.

708
01:01:49,716 --> 01:01:53,058
Thank you Madam President.

709
01:01:53,098 --> 01:01:56,038
The $90,000 for the groundwater remediation, what is that gonna be paid for?

710
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:58,079
I know that's not for you.

711
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:59,920
Yeah, thank you.

712
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:03,161
I know this is for the parking lot in West Memphis, correct?

713
01:02:04,361 --> 01:02:05,461
Correct.

714
01:02:06,042 --> 01:02:08,562
What are we paying the 90,000 for?

715
01:02:08,582 --> 01:02:10,643
Are we still pumping chemicals into the ground?

716
01:02:10,951 --> 01:02:16,513
No, so this is this is the tail end of the project so I think there's been a long term commitment from the city well before my time.

717
01:02:17,053 --> 01:02:21,854
And then you know that commitment is just about complete.

718
01:02:22,154 --> 01:02:34,958
So this would basically be the very last couple years of monitoring and air testing to finish the project so this is really the home stretch, a little bit longer than we anticipated by about, you know, six months or so but

719
01:02:35,633 --> 01:02:38,414
We're at the home stretch, so hopefully things continue to go well.

720
01:02:38,914 --> 01:02:41,675
And what's the status of the parking lot?

721
01:02:42,135 --> 01:02:43,275
I know it was pretty bad.

722
01:02:43,295 --> 01:02:45,096
I know you've been working on it for a long time.

723
01:02:45,816 --> 01:02:46,757
Where does it stand now?

724
01:02:46,857 --> 01:02:49,918
So this is a good milestone.

725
01:02:49,938 --> 01:02:52,398
I mean, really, the injections are complete.

726
01:02:52,878 --> 01:03:04,162
So really, this is making sure that the treatments worked, monitoring the groundwater, monitoring the air to make sure that it's clean and can proceed to the next step to close out the radiation.

727
01:03:04,813 --> 01:03:13,319
So that's what I said this is really out of many hundreds of dollars this is no I know I said I've been, I've been when we started this project and that was it was pretty good.

728
01:03:13,339 --> 01:03:13,979
Thank you.

729
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:15,440
You're welcome.

730
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:16,061
Thank you.

731
01:03:16,141 --> 01:03:19,963
Thank you very much, Madam President, Mr. McGovern, how are you sir.

732
01:03:20,224 --> 01:03:20,524
Excellent.

733
01:03:20,764 --> 01:03:21,164
Quick question.

734
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:26,482
this remediation project is the property owner responsible for payments of any of the radiation.

735
01:03:27,463 --> 01:03:31,745
So, yes, so the city of Medford is a property owner.

736
01:03:31,765 --> 01:03:41,671
And there was, I believe, you know, legal proceedings underneath, you know, under the, the contingency plan in Massachusetts contingency plan.

737
01:03:42,211 --> 01:03:44,733
And it was determined that the city did have a responsibility.

738
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:51,076
The mayor at the time did make a commitment for, you know, putting the payments forward to obligate that commitment.

739
01:03:51,696 --> 01:03:52,437
And we have been doing

740
01:03:53,143 --> 01:03:56,425
doing that for a few years now, and this would be basically the end.

741
01:03:56,665 --> 01:04:01,087
Are there any other remediation commitments from any of the neighbors that are privately owned parcels there?

742
01:04:01,227 --> 01:04:02,328
I believe they've been exhausted.

743
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:09,172
Has the city made any payments to private entities or interests relative to the remediation that is possible or abiding?

744
01:04:09,612 --> 01:04:10,593
Not recently that I'm aware of.

745
01:04:10,653 --> 01:04:17,817
If you can give me a breakdown of that please from your office if the expenses have been made payments to the to any of butter of the mediation project.

746
01:04:18,037 --> 01:04:21,279
Sure, if there was it was for my time we probably get that information.

747
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:21,840
Thank you.

748
01:04:27,514 --> 01:04:31,137
Thank you, President real, not a question for you, Director McGovern but thank you so much.

749
01:04:31,197 --> 01:04:39,804
I just wanted to circle back quickly to the hundred $65,000 free cash appropriation for the three hybrid hybrid police cruisers.

750
01:04:40,664 --> 01:04:48,430
And first just thank you to all the department heads who have provided context around these appropriations more just a comment I know earlier in our budget process, you know we've.

751
01:04:49,231 --> 01:04:58,715
in the scope of other useful amendments to the budget process just to add some accountability transparency legibility for this council and also residents.

752
01:05:00,156 --> 01:05:03,538
You know as counselors probably said this wasn't something that I think was included in the.

753
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:07,059
budget presentation for the police department.

754
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:11,980
It's good to know that this is typically a free cash appropriation when we buy new police cruisers.

755
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:22,482
I just wanted to reiterate an idea that was floated earlier in budget season that we do a more thorough job of separating out capital expenses, operating budget.

756
01:05:22,542 --> 01:05:30,924
I think that it's useful for this council to be able to have a full accounting per department, even where those severances are the norm.

757
01:05:30,984 --> 01:05:33,625
And I think it's helpful for residents as well.

758
01:05:34,425 --> 01:05:43,391
to be able to get a fuller picture pre cash appropriation operating budget capital expenditures to get a fuller picture of the breakdown per department.

759
01:05:43,932 --> 01:05:44,232
Thank you.

760
01:05:46,393 --> 01:05:46,794
Thank you.

761
01:05:46,814 --> 01:05:48,235
bears then back to Councilor Carvel.

762
01:05:50,676 --> 01:05:51,017
Thank you.

763
01:05:51,237 --> 01:05:52,498
Motion to rejoin and approve.

764
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:59,002
We'll go to Councilor Carvel for taking up that motion.

765
01:05:59,643 --> 01:06:00,223
One more question.

766
01:06:00,962 --> 01:06:07,124
I know some of the abutters have incurred some serious legal costs over the years of this.

767
01:06:07,784 --> 01:06:13,186
Are they going to be paid back any of their legal costs?

768
01:06:14,386 --> 01:06:17,027
It wasn't their fault.

769
01:06:18,615 --> 01:06:20,416
I do not know the answers to that.

770
01:06:21,657 --> 01:06:30,000
And I, I don't know, I haven't seen any commitments or claims come across my desk I review the reports and I pay the bills.

771
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:40,404
But as I say, I do know that you'll be about as have, you know, we pay for the, the process for testing the air, I believe the electrical bills and right all that.

772
01:06:40,684 --> 01:06:46,247
So we're supporting them through the final testing phases, so they're not on the hook for that.

773
01:06:47,590 --> 01:06:53,551
But I say, but I do know that they have on their own, their own legal bills trying to get this done.

774
01:06:53,611 --> 01:06:54,631
It's something that really wasn't there.

775
01:06:54,691 --> 01:06:56,192
It's not the city's fault either.

776
01:06:56,692 --> 01:06:57,452
People don't know it.

777
01:06:58,092 --> 01:07:00,613
Somewhere on the line, there was multiple dry cleaners there.

778
01:07:00,653 --> 01:07:09,334
And back in those days, I mean, the thing was just stumping out the back door and, you know, and there's a major water table under there that's moved, that goes all over the place.

779
01:07:09,354 --> 01:07:16,896
So I'm just glad that we, you know, we've got it cleaned up enough so it's not that contaminated anymore.

780
01:07:18,532 --> 01:07:19,853
Any further discussion from councilors?

781
01:07:21,495 --> 01:07:22,496
So we do have a motion on the floor.

782
01:07:23,337 --> 01:07:25,298
Councilor Knight withdraws his motion.

783
01:07:25,579 --> 01:07:29,943
So we don't need to take up, but we already voted on your motion.

784
01:07:31,064 --> 01:07:32,285
We already, oh, sorry.

785
01:07:32,545 --> 01:07:34,527
We already voted on the motion to separate.

786
01:07:35,548 --> 01:07:38,191
We already approved that motion.

787
01:07:38,311 --> 01:07:40,253
So we have the motion on the floor from Vice-President Behrs.

788
01:07:40,273 --> 01:07:41,734
Would you like to second that?

789
01:07:42,755 --> 01:07:43,756
Okay, seconded by Councilor Knight.

790
01:07:44,298 --> 01:07:46,300
Are there any members of the public would like to speak?

791
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,042
I do see one just one question came through the zoom chat.

792
01:07:49,622 --> 01:07:52,004
If I could just anyone else like to speak.

793
01:07:52,665 --> 01:07:55,627
So this is just from Steve schnapp.

794
01:07:56,468 --> 01:08:06,937
So this is just a question which I think Councillor Collins kind of addresses why has the purchase of new police cruisers not been in the police department budget for the last two decades as was said is this because it's a capital item and it just

795
01:08:07,685 --> 01:08:08,305
Sorry, can you hear me?

796
01:08:09,386 --> 01:08:19,552
If you're able to provide background, well, historically, the police cruisers are not included in the yearly budget.

797
01:08:20,592 --> 01:08:22,293
There's just disprecedence.

798
01:08:24,655 --> 01:08:27,136
Right, because it's capital, because it's capital.

799
01:08:27,176 --> 01:08:29,357
Yes, okay, because it's a capital request, right.

800
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:30,298
Thank you.

801
01:08:30,758 --> 01:08:31,659
Councilor Scarlatti.

802
01:08:40,601 --> 01:08:44,427
eliminate security guys at the high school correct that's not true.

803
01:08:44,447 --> 01:08:50,498
Because I think that said and I just want to clarify for the public that's

804
01:08:52,349 --> 01:08:53,310
Name and address, please.

805
01:08:53,851 --> 01:08:57,895
David Murphy for a man with a treatment rehearsal assistant superintendent for public schools.

806
01:08:58,756 --> 01:09:01,259
I thank you for the question Councilor Scarpelli.

807
01:09:01,699 --> 01:09:11,310
I think this, this may have come up in our budget hearing for you last week, where Mr. Mosaic who served at this right for a key over 40 years, retired and.

808
01:09:12,251 --> 01:09:18,197
It is true that his position was one that as I understand it long before both my time and superintendents.

809
01:09:19,038 --> 01:09:24,423
There was a group of positions called security guards.

810
01:09:26,373 --> 01:09:41,584
Within the last several years, again, as I understand it, because it precedes my time, the district has staffed a position of security monitors, who are generally the individuals who greet you when you come to our school communities during the course of the school day.

811
01:09:42,305 --> 01:09:47,189
They're also responsible for making sure that the door is monitored, obviously, as the name would imply.

812
01:09:47,209 --> 01:09:55,475
And we, over the course of the last year, have actually increased the number of security monitors who are employed by the district so that we can make sure that we are having

813
01:09:55,895 --> 01:09:58,197
appropriate coverage across all of the schools.

814
01:09:58,917 --> 01:10:09,024
There's also an additional position responsible for security that, as Mr. South knows, we've been engaged in discussions about how that position should be classified and compensated going forward.

815
01:10:09,064 --> 01:10:14,167
And those conversations are ongoing, and I imagine they'll continue over the course of the summer.

816
01:10:14,227 --> 01:10:22,633
But it is not my expectation that with Mr. Mosaic having been the final person to have the title security guard after the position

817
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:31,535
At one point had, as I've been told close to 10 individuals but not over the course of the last more than 10 years since there's been more than one.

818
01:10:32,235 --> 01:10:44,838
It would not be my expectation that we would have an additional security guard per se, but we'll certainly continue to employ a group of individuals security monitors and then the other position that I referenced that are responsible for building security and I.

819
01:10:45,678 --> 01:11:00,654
You know, I, I'll leave my comments there except to say that all of us are familiar with some of the highly publicized security breaches that have occurred in school communities, and it would be my hope that.

820
01:11:02,035 --> 01:11:21,790
those incidents would not be exploited in conversations pertaining to our staffing structures at the Medford Public Schools, because if there is any question about how seriously the superintendent and the rest of the administration take the security of our buildings, I would suggest that that is probably being made by individuals that are not familiar with us or our work.

821
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:25,313
So again, just the question, because of the

822
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,316
the word that was said there was no security.

823
01:11:28,776 --> 01:11:30,438
We still have that statement is false.

824
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:31,459
We have the monitors.

825
01:11:31,659 --> 01:11:31,940
Correct.

826
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:35,624
And we're also very grateful for our partnership with Chief Buckley and the rest of the police department.

827
01:11:35,764 --> 01:11:38,868
We still have a resource student resource officer too.

828
01:11:39,208 --> 01:11:39,468
Correct.

829
01:11:39,588 --> 01:11:42,031
And now that I know that opposite.

830
01:11:43,553 --> 01:11:47,816
Mosaic was the point person, I believe, maybe I'm wrong, with the monitors.

831
01:11:48,816 --> 01:11:50,297
Who does that fall onto now?

832
01:11:50,357 --> 01:11:51,678
Was that fall to Chief Buckley's?

833
01:11:52,018 --> 01:11:55,320
But no, it's that's within their school department employees.

834
01:11:55,340 --> 01:12:06,406
And so Mr. McLaughlin, as director of buildings and grounds, the individual that I referenced earlier, whose position we're currently in discussions about exactly how that position will be classified, they share responsibility for that.

835
01:12:06,426 --> 01:12:08,348
And I agree this when you're talking about security,

836
01:12:09,108 --> 01:12:10,929
in a public forum, it's very, very tricky.

837
01:12:10,969 --> 01:12:33,640
So I think this is something that maybe the school committee, the city council and the administration should sit down in a committee of the whole with an executive session to really bring up some, making sure that we've, what's going on, especially lately, that we're making sure that everybody's comfortable and that's reiterated together as a team.

838
01:12:33,660 --> 01:12:36,422
So again, I thank you and that answers my question.

839
01:12:36,462 --> 01:12:36,662
Thank you.

840
01:12:37,422 --> 01:12:39,304
I wanna redirect to the paper that's before us.

841
01:12:39,364 --> 01:12:40,305
Sorry about that.

842
01:12:40,345 --> 01:12:41,546
I just know that.

843
01:12:42,127 --> 01:12:45,410
Are you speaking on the paper before us Mr. South or what?

844
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:47,672
Speaking on the issue that you're talking about now.

845
01:12:47,993 --> 01:12:50,035
We can circle back to it during the main budget talks.

846
01:12:50,095 --> 01:12:51,136
We have a motion on the floor.

847
01:12:51,156 --> 01:12:52,757
We have some folks who wanna speak on this paper.

848
01:12:53,438 --> 01:12:54,779
So I'm happy to go back to that.

849
01:12:57,621 --> 01:12:59,663
So we do have a number of folks who wanna speak on Zoom.

850
01:12:59,683 --> 01:13:03,707
I have some, just for the folks watching on Zoom, I have some chats coming in.

851
01:13:03,727 --> 01:13:04,688
I'm gonna turn off the chat.

852
01:13:04,748 --> 01:13:06,750
If you'd like to speak, please just raise your hand.

853
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:09,212
It's too much for me to try to read everything that comes to the chat.

854
01:13:09,612 --> 01:13:14,296
If you don't feel comfortable giving your address on Zoom, you can always message it to the clerk after the fact.

855
01:13:16,929 --> 01:13:19,113
RA Goffman name and address for the record, please.

856
01:13:19,514 --> 01:13:24,763
And Chief Buckley, these questions are going to be directed to you if you want to give you the time to walk over.

857
01:13:26,669 --> 01:13:28,731
Hi, Ari Goffman, 1 Chestnut Street.

858
01:13:29,853 --> 01:13:32,215
My question is about the police cruisers.

859
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:34,618
Are they replacing non-operational vehicles?

860
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:48,373
And I ask, given the budget situation this year, I'm wondering if otherwise routine upgrades should proceed as planned if the existing vehicles are operational, or could we defer that money to areas where we have shortfalls?

861
01:13:50,831 --> 01:13:53,592
So they are replacing existing vehicles.

862
01:13:54,052 --> 01:13:57,012
We have extensive wear and tear on our current vehicles.

863
01:13:57,072 --> 01:14:01,954
Again, we said, I talked about this in our budget here, and I know Mike Wentzel works on these vehicles this year.

864
01:14:01,994 --> 01:14:04,574
President probably should come up and talk about the conditions of the vehicles.

865
01:14:04,614 --> 01:14:09,015
But the last time we purchased a cruiser was 2019.

866
01:14:09,335 --> 01:14:10,556
Prior to that, it was probably 2017.

867
01:14:10,596 --> 01:14:13,176
These were our primary cars.

868
01:14:13,496 --> 01:14:18,537
And you have to remember that these vehicles are operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

869
01:14:18,898 --> 01:14:20,618
There's no downtime on any of these vehicles.

870
01:14:20,758 --> 01:14:22,660
That's heavy, heavy wear and tear on them.

871
01:14:23,141 --> 01:14:25,303
And that's the reason for the replacement.

872
01:14:25,823 --> 01:14:30,869
And, and, uh, and the best circumstances we should be replacing them every day, you know what I mean?

873
01:14:30,949 --> 01:14:32,070
Rotation coming through.

874
01:14:32,491 --> 01:14:42,041
So if, if you would like a response more on the mechanical side of things in the conditions, I would defer to, you know, Mikey's back there, but I think that there's a response.

875
01:14:43,347 --> 01:14:44,107
Thank you, Chief Buckley.

876
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:45,948
Vice President Behrs and then we have another person.

877
01:14:46,008 --> 01:14:47,489
I'll wait until after the public participation.

878
01:14:47,629 --> 01:14:49,250
Okay, so we have Penelope Taylor.

879
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:50,651
Just name and address for the record, please.

880
01:14:55,473 --> 01:14:56,033
Great, thanks.

881
01:14:56,734 --> 01:14:59,255
Penny Taylor, 29 Martin Street, Medford.

882
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:08,739
I guess I was just wondering in understanding, I guess, how the police budget works, if the chief has discretion within the budget, or if

883
01:15:10,633 --> 01:15:16,257
I just, if that kind of mechanic, if I could ask about that mechanic.

884
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:24,863
You want to just more of a deeper mechanic answer to the previous question.

885
01:15:27,144 --> 01:15:28,485
Oh, sorry, you got muted.

886
01:15:29,646 --> 01:15:30,326
Yeah, sorry about that.

887
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:31,687
Um, I guess I was wondering.

888
01:15:34,201 --> 01:15:42,946
I'm coming from the city where the model is that the chief of police ultimately has discretion on where budgetary line items are.

889
01:15:42,966 --> 01:15:57,053
I guess this is more thinking about where the role is going, as earlier mentioned, and I would just both ask that mechanical question and advise that that will not be placed in the police department or at least ask that it not be.

890
01:15:57,153 --> 01:15:57,413
Thank you.

891
01:15:58,748 --> 01:16:03,452
So I think there's two questions just first just the level of discretion you have and preparing the budget I believe is the question.

892
01:16:04,272 --> 01:16:07,175
If you're able to go over that briefly, as it relates to police cruisers.

893
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:17,843
The mechanic, the person fixing the cars is in the DPW budget.

894
01:16:17,883 --> 01:16:18,123
Correct.

895
01:16:18,143 --> 01:16:20,766
The mechanic who works on the cruises is in the DPW budget.

896
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:24,869
Most of the funding for that repairs is in the DPW budget.

897
01:16:24,969 --> 01:16:30,714
We do replace out of my budget parts, auto parts, and that works that way.

898
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,456
Sorry, that one was lost.

899
01:16:33,064 --> 01:16:33,384
Thank you.

900
01:16:33,604 --> 01:16:37,426
Does that, I think, I think Penny is, okay, I'm getting a thumbs up.

901
01:16:37,486 --> 01:16:39,047
So I feel embarrassed.

902
01:16:39,067 --> 01:16:39,507
Thank you.

903
01:16:40,648 --> 01:16:44,369
I don't want to belabor this because I think these are all relatively reasonable requests.

904
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:52,153
I think what frustrates me here is that the original budget proposal before June 2nd was planning to use free cash for all the other needs in this community.

905
01:16:52,593 --> 01:16:58,356
And now we don't have that money here now to go to our schools and our library and all the other city departments that have been cut.

906
01:16:58,376 --> 01:16:59,316
So,

907
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:06,065
I'm not against this.

908
01:17:06,846 --> 01:17:08,206
I'd like to call the question on it.

909
01:17:08,226 --> 01:17:09,967
I think we've belabored it quite a bit.

910
01:17:11,107 --> 01:17:16,688
But my question is just why don't we have a free cash request here to restore the funding that's been cut since June 2nd?

911
01:17:16,808 --> 01:17:20,049
So again, I call the question to rejoin these, approve and move on.

912
01:17:20,369 --> 01:17:23,450
Okay, we still have one more person for public participation on Zoom.

913
01:17:24,211 --> 01:17:26,231
Rick Capraro, name and address for the record, please.

914
01:17:31,913 --> 01:17:32,613

938

22-428 to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding ARPA revenue loss.

939
01:19:37,504 --> 01:19:42,711
Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable Body approve $7,292,100.00

940
01:19:47,077 --> 01:19:52,761
in ARPA funds for the FY23 budget in relation to revenue losses due to COVID-19 as specified by the U.S.

941
01:19:52,781 --> 01:19:58,105
Treasury for the purpose of funding fiscal year 2023 personnel salaries in the following departments.

942
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:00,647
$3,542,100 in the school department, $1,250,000 in the Department of Public Works highway, $1,250,000

943
01:20:07,852 --> 01:20:16,300
in the fire department $1,250,000 in the police department for the total amount of $7,292,100 and zero cents.

944
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,241
Thanks for your kind attention to this matter.

945
01:20:18,922 --> 01:20:20,543
Sincerely brown logo for me.

946
01:20:23,846 --> 01:20:27,410
Any discussion or emotion on this paper, as I understand it, Madam President.

947
01:20:28,245 --> 01:20:41,975
This appropriation would replace the revenue shortfalls that came with poor economic performance in regards to permitting meals taxes, hotel restaurant taxes, and new growth, as well as development permitting.

948
01:20:42,255 --> 01:20:45,917
The ABA funds were put in place for us to replace revenues when we come into shortfalls like this.

949
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:48,639
So it seems like it's something that we need to do.

950
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:52,862
Whether or not we want to, we need this $7 million in revenue to balance the budget.

951
01:20:53,143 --> 01:20:56,265
We need this $7 million in revenue to be sure that our government continues to operate.

952
01:20:56,745 --> 01:21:01,909
We need this $7 million, the corporation I'm sorry not government corporations so this corporation operates.

953
01:21:03,029 --> 01:21:05,071
So, I just wanted to make that quick.

954
01:21:05,771 --> 01:21:07,793
Thank you.

955
01:21:08,753 --> 01:21:13,677
Thank you, President, I just, um, I just wanted to note for for context.

956
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:36,132
I don't have an opinion either way on if this is a good use of ARPA funds it's an acceptable use of ARPA funds it's an eligible use of ARPA funds, but I just wanted to make the point that it's a $7.2 million bite out of a finite $48 million Apple, and this was brought up earlier in the budget season I just want to reiterate that.

957
01:21:37,213 --> 01:21:47,922
The narrative around use of ARPA funds is that there's four categories of eligible uses and there's going to be a robust public process for determining the use of some of those funds.

958
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:50,504
And I think the fact that we are

959
01:21:51,610 --> 01:21:59,552
leaning heavily on one of the, you know, I'll be eligible uses revenue replacement for salaries, which is a perfectly fine compliant use of that money.

960
01:21:59,992 --> 01:22:10,435
But I think that the residents deserve a more transparent and frequently updated view of where we're dispensing our funding, especially since

961
01:22:12,150 --> 01:22:16,712
The story that's told about ARPA is that everybody gets to weigh in on how that money is used.

962
01:22:17,192 --> 01:22:27,736
And I think people need to have a really clear insight as to when they'll get the chip in, how meaningful that input will be because of how much we'll have left.

963
01:22:28,936 --> 01:22:29,136
Thank you.

964
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:40,075
Thank you, Madam President, and additionally for context here.

965
01:22:40,936 --> 01:22:43,158
If you've been following the saga of the last month.

966
01:22:43,839 --> 01:22:45,681
This is the money where we thought we had 8 million

967
01:22:46,684 --> 01:22:49,766
Then we only had 4 million, then we had 7.2 million.

968
01:22:50,026 --> 01:22:50,886
So this is that money.

969
01:22:52,507 --> 01:23:01,972
Now, initially in the proposed budget, and I have it right here, the plan was to spend something like 205 million on the whole city budget.

970
01:23:02,912 --> 01:23:09,596
Then when we found out that the ARPA was not gonna be eight, but 4 million, we had to cut to about 201 million.

971
01:23:09,616 --> 01:23:16,259
And then, thanks to the fine work of our finance department, digging out from the hole that we were in,

972
01:23:17,378 --> 01:23:26,969
in terms of knowing where everything was, we ended up back at 7.292, almost 7.3 million, which is almost the 8 million that we were originally planning to use.

973
01:23:27,650 --> 01:23:35,339
But none of that, you know, now basically the plan is, well, we cut it already, so now we don't have to do free cash anymore, so we'll stick with the 201.

974
01:23:36,700 --> 01:23:41,403
So of course, I'm going to approve this because we need it and it's covering our structural deficit.

975
01:23:41,963 --> 01:23:47,407
But at the end of the day, that's about as short as I can summarize what's happened over the past month around this money.

976
01:23:48,528 --> 01:23:54,852
So, as I said on the free cash appropriation I do wish that there was additional papers before us tonight.

977
01:23:55,732 --> 01:24:12,516
to try to bring us back up closer to that 205 million to try to bring us back up the 2.8 million that got came out of the school budget over the last month, the 1.7 million that came out of our city departments, maybe even a moving that a little bit around as we know for certain priorities, but this is what we have.

978
01:24:13,136 --> 01:24:18,897
I'm certainly not going to vote against this, because I would just, you know, this is the federal government covering our structural deficit for now.

979
01:24:20,087 --> 01:24:22,148
We might not have it next year to cover the deficit.

980
01:24:22,768 --> 01:24:27,571
We certainly won't have it in two years, cause the money has to be spent in by December of 2024.

981
01:24:28,752 --> 01:24:30,353
So we're lucky we have this.

982
01:24:30,393 --> 01:24:35,255
We're lucky that the federal government passed this, but it's not a long-term answer.

983
01:24:35,315 --> 01:24:36,596
It's not even a short-term answer.

984
01:24:36,816 --> 01:24:38,257
It may not even be an answer next year.

985
01:24:38,477 --> 01:24:44,840
So when it comes down to it, we need to find another source of revenue other than this ARPA money to address our structural deficit.

986
01:24:45,641 --> 01:24:47,842
And we don't have that many options to raise that kind of money.

987
01:24:54,647 --> 01:24:56,728
Thank you, Madam President, I would move approval.

988
01:24:57,449 --> 01:24:58,049
Councilor Carviel.

989
01:24:58,229 --> 01:24:59,390
Thank you, Madam President.

990
01:25:00,991 --> 01:25:06,274
How much money is left in APRA funds right now after this expenditure and other monies that we spent?

991
01:25:07,054 --> 01:25:09,055
Do we know how much is left?

992
01:25:09,556 --> 01:25:12,057
Can someone from the administration provide that information?

993
01:25:12,077 --> 01:25:16,039
We do have our federal funds manager here.

994
01:25:16,059 --> 01:25:20,002
I think we have the APRA funds manager.

995
01:25:20,082 --> 01:25:21,122
Maybe she can answer the question.

996
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:22,503
Molly, would you like to come up?

997
01:25:29,733 --> 01:25:30,974
just name and address for the record, please.

998
01:25:33,136 --> 01:25:39,002
Hi there, Molly Kivy, and my address is 9 Medford Street, Somerville, Massachusetts.

999
01:25:40,963 --> 01:25:45,888
So right now we have, I forgot my binder, I'm just gonna grab my binder.

1000
01:26:00,794 --> 01:26:02,235
Sorry for the delay.

1001
01:26:06,956 --> 01:26:27,345
Right now, we have approved allocated 23 million, which includes a 7.3 million of revenue replacement for FY23.

1002
01:26:29,511 --> 01:26:36,074
and the 12.3 for FY 22, and then spent 643,000.

1003
01:26:37,014 --> 01:26:48,558
So what is left is 48 million less the 23 is around 25 million left, yes.

1004
01:26:48,578 --> 01:26:49,539
So what was that?

1005
01:26:49,559 --> 01:26:51,399
25 million left.

1006
01:26:51,419 --> 01:26:54,320
25 million left, yes, of unallocated.

1007
01:26:54,641 --> 01:26:55,961
After these expenditures.

1008
01:26:55,981 --> 01:26:56,121
Yes.

1009
01:26:56,181 --> 01:26:57,582
And the 23 million is already spent.

1010
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,492
Would it be possible for you to send us a breakdown?

1011
01:27:01,512 --> 01:27:02,853
Most definitely.

1012
01:27:02,913 --> 01:27:04,374
Of the $23 million we've spent on?

1013
01:27:04,874 --> 01:27:05,094
Yes.

1014
01:27:05,154 --> 01:27:05,494
Thank you.

1015
01:27:08,015 --> 01:27:08,456
Thank you, Molly.

1016
01:27:08,676 --> 01:27:17,600
Madam President, we can make that as an amendment, a motion that we request that the director send us a breakdown of the $23 million spent.

1017
01:27:17,980 --> 01:27:18,200
Yep.

1018
01:27:20,481 --> 01:27:21,082
Councilor Scarpelli.

1019
01:27:21,622 --> 01:27:22,562
Thank you, Molly.

1020
01:27:23,503 --> 01:27:25,084
Thank you so much, because I know this isn't,

1021
01:27:25,965 --> 01:27:29,627
This isn't a job that's been in place for many years.

1022
01:27:29,687 --> 01:27:34,310
This is something that you're thrown into a fire and saying, okay, now you're in charge.

1023
01:27:35,011 --> 01:27:45,057
And it's very difficult because I'm directly involved in how the money is distributed as a department head and getting involved.

1024
01:27:46,938 --> 01:27:55,842
The question that I have, and I don't want to put you on the spot, when we're talking about opera recovery, and you're talking about the people that were mostly affected, that was the teachers.

1025
01:27:57,843 --> 01:28:14,390
Was that weighted to look at what the teachers have gone through and to support whatever money could be used to then work with their administration on what they deserve, which is a reasonable wage increase?

1026
01:28:15,230 --> 01:28:16,498
Is that something that could have been done?

1027
01:28:29,828 --> 01:28:32,210
I will defer to the administration on that.

1028
01:28:32,650 --> 01:28:47,958
In the six ARPA meetings that I've had with the administration talking about long-term and short-term strategy on the funds, there has not been an extensive conversation about teacher contracts.

1029
01:28:49,099 --> 01:28:54,641
In those six meetings that I've had since January to talk about $50 million,

1030
01:28:57,222 --> 01:29:05,425
Okay, so again, I know this is a difficult job and there's so many moving pieces, what you can use it for, what you can't use it for.

1031
01:29:05,445 --> 01:29:10,047
And I know there are some communities that try to manipulate the system to try to get ahead.

1032
01:29:10,127 --> 01:29:25,833
But like I said, I've seen ARPA move other communities in the most important avenues like libraries and recreation and mental health

1033
01:29:27,696 --> 01:29:31,839
and education and teachers and seeing where that goes.

1034
01:29:31,879 --> 01:29:44,309
So I know that it's not apples to apples because our deficiencies are very different than neighbor communities, but you answered that's a glaring question that's a little bothersome to me.

1035
01:29:44,329 --> 01:29:45,250
So thank you so much.

1036
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:46,231
I appreciate your honesty.

1037
01:29:46,711 --> 01:29:47,031
Of course.

1038
01:29:48,267 --> 01:29:52,150
I'd just like to remind everybody, I am not the final decider on these funds.

1039
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:55,012
I am the administrator and the manager.

1040
01:29:55,532 --> 01:30:01,397
Again, I should have made that clear that you're just the person putting the numbers down and handing it off.

1041
01:30:01,417 --> 01:30:03,538
So it's not the person that's making decisions.

1042
01:30:03,558 --> 01:30:04,019
So thank you.

1043
01:30:04,739 --> 01:30:05,139
Thank you.

1044
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:06,540
Thank you, Manager Kivy.

1045
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:08,482
Any further discussion from the council?

1046
01:30:11,144 --> 01:30:12,585
Those of the public who would like to speak?

1047
01:30:14,445 --> 01:30:16,330
Do you have two motions on the floor?

1048
01:30:16,631 --> 01:30:17,694
I think Mr Murphy.

1049
01:30:21,820 --> 01:30:22,500
Thanks, Molly.

1050
01:30:22,900 --> 01:30:23,721
Thank you, President Morrell.

1051
01:30:24,561 --> 01:30:26,862
Just with Councilor Scarpelli's question.

1052
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:35,766
So last year, the Medford Public Schools operating budget received a calculated appropriation of $3.7 million from the ARPA fund.

1053
01:30:36,266 --> 01:30:40,968
And this year, as I believe was related in the communication before you now, it's $3.5 million.

1054
01:30:41,088 --> 01:30:49,271
So the school department considers ourselves the beneficiary of the federal program that Councilor Behr has referred to earlier.

1055
01:30:49,891 --> 01:31:07,524
and we're grateful both to the city administration as well as this honorable body for allowing us to have the operating budget that we've had, which frankly has included an enormous amount of staffing structures, initiatives, and programs that have helped us combat the impact of the pandemic on our students.

1056
01:31:07,584 --> 01:31:14,849
So to answer your question, frankly, with regard to how the schools benefited from the opera, it's to the tune of $3.7 million in FY22 and a projected $3.5 million in FY23.

1057
01:31:20,330 --> 01:31:29,034
Okay, like I said, though, I think that it's an understanding, just different deficiencies that we had to maintain.

1058
01:31:30,635 --> 01:31:40,259
But was there ever an opportunity to look at that piece when it comes to funding the teachers and how, I mean, that must have been difficult.

1059
01:31:40,459 --> 01:31:45,341
So in the absence of the ARPA funding and FY22 and FY23, we'd be facing massive layoffs.

1060
01:31:45,721 --> 01:31:47,442
That's not the case, and we're grateful for that.

1061
01:31:48,237 --> 01:31:51,922
Okay, so we know that we said that there were 30 people that.

1062
01:31:52,870 --> 01:31:54,371
were given- I did not say that.

1063
01:31:54,391 --> 01:31:55,171
That was an incorrect statement.

1064
01:31:55,191 --> 01:31:55,552
No, no, I apologize.

1065
01:31:55,572 --> 01:31:56,833
I'm not sure who said that, but it was inaccurate.

1066
01:31:56,873 --> 01:31:57,373
No, I apologize.

1067
01:31:57,433 --> 01:32:00,855
Okay, so I know we had teachers that were pink slipped.

1068
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:01,716
I don't know how many there were.

1069
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:03,577
Were they all retained now?

1070
01:32:03,597 --> 01:32:04,177
Are they all back?

1071
01:32:05,038 --> 01:32:09,040
Frankly, that's gonna be determined in part this evening by your actions in the budget.

1072
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:09,180
Okay.

1073
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:20,567
And it's my hope that we'll be able to issue as many restoration notices and rescissions of those budget-related non-renewals, a number that fell far short of the number that's been referenced here.

1074
01:32:22,148 --> 01:32:24,569
My hope is that we have a budget and we're able to do that quickly.

1075
01:32:25,549 --> 01:32:25,769
Thank you.

1076
01:32:41,727 --> 01:32:46,270
There were 29 educators that received a non-renewal notice.

1077
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:48,071
So that is a fact.

1078
01:32:48,531 --> 01:32:50,372
I have those letters, they were sent to me.

1079
01:32:50,793 --> 01:32:52,734
So I'm the one who clearly stated that.

1080
01:32:53,294 --> 01:32:54,535
And I want that to be stated.

1081
01:32:55,055 --> 01:33:01,219
And if we look at the budget, as Mr. Murphy has just stated, yes, those positions are still in the budget.

1082
01:33:01,499 --> 01:33:05,622
So I'm going to assume that those people will be back, okay?

1083
01:33:06,469 --> 01:33:14,812
And if when we get to the budget tonight, I wanna make it clear that we have 15 teachers that are retiring this year.

1084
01:33:15,212 --> 01:33:16,772
Those teachers are still on the budget.

1085
01:33:17,112 --> 01:33:18,173
They need to be replaced.

1086
01:33:18,633 --> 01:33:26,715
To the best of my knowledge, we have 10 that I am aware of resignations of teachers within this system.

1087
01:33:27,075 --> 01:33:29,056
Those teachers will need to be rehired.

1088
01:33:30,036 --> 01:33:34,878
Lord knows where we will get those teachers as there is very little

1089
01:33:35,730 --> 01:33:39,291
there is not a great deal of teachers applying for positions.

1090
01:33:40,371 --> 01:33:42,971
And there have been many articles on that.

1091
01:33:43,272 --> 01:33:50,273
50% of the teachers will be leaving this profession within the next two years, either to retirement or to other things.

1092
01:33:50,593 --> 01:33:58,695
But I want to make that perfectly clear that I was the one who stated that, and I have no issue with stating it because I did receive those letters.

1093
01:33:59,135 --> 01:33:59,515
Thank you.

1094
01:33:59,835 --> 01:34:00,155
Thank you, Ms.

1095
01:34:00,195 --> 01:34:00,375
Edwards.

1096
01:34:11,588 --> 01:34:13,329
Thank you, Madam President.

1097
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:31,043
Sorry, if I just may, I just want to say before we continue here, that according to state law and the conversations with the Division of Local Services, our vote here tonight will have no impact on the ability of the Medford Public Schools to hire or rehire anybody.

1098
01:34:31,484 --> 01:34:31,824
Thank you.

1099
01:34:32,204 --> 01:34:33,025
Thank you, Representative Ferris.

1100
01:34:33,265 --> 01:34:34,366
Name and address for the record, please.

1101
01:34:34,686 --> 01:34:38,569
My name's Joanne McKay, 35 Court Street, Roberts Elementary School.

1102
01:34:38,589 --> 01:34:39,450
I'm a fourth grade teacher.

1103
01:34:40,429 --> 01:34:44,192
Hello City Council Members, thank you for allowing me the opportunity to speak.

1104
01:34:44,913 --> 01:34:51,839
I've been asked to speak tonight on behalf of the dedicated elementary teachers of the Medford Public School to express our thoughts and concerns.

1105
01:34:52,559 --> 01:35:02,368
Before I begin, I would also like to take a moment to say that while I'm speaking on behalf of the educators, we can't help but give a shout out to all the amazing staff and the Medford Public Schools.

1106
01:35:02,968 --> 01:35:04,689
Educators cannot do their jobs alone.

1107
01:35:05,230 --> 01:35:08,211
And during this pandemic, this has become all the more clear.

1108
01:35:08,772 --> 01:35:13,075
As the saying goes, it takes a village and the village certainly gives their all daily.

1109
01:35:14,456 --> 01:35:16,897
We can't express what support staff has done for us.

1110
01:35:16,937 --> 01:35:18,758
I think we should give them a little round of applause.

1111
01:35:18,798 --> 01:35:31,306
It's not just about them.

1112
01:35:31,426 --> 01:35:32,107
It should come back on.

1113
01:35:33,251 --> 01:35:33,491
Jane.

1114
01:35:33,951 --> 01:35:34,571
Okay, sorry.

1115
01:35:35,131 --> 01:35:39,852
To say the education profession has become a challenge during this pandemic is an understatement.

1116
01:35:40,392 --> 01:35:46,534
We all know that this has become increasingly more difficult over the years, but during the pandemic, it has been unprecedented.

1117
01:35:47,174 --> 01:35:53,595
However, due to our love and care for the children, educators have persevered and we've worked harder than we ever have before.

1118
01:35:54,235 --> 01:35:58,836
We've heard a lot recently during our negotiations that it's all about the kids.

1119
01:35:59,596 --> 01:36:01,517
Does the district think that we don't know this?

1120
01:36:02,497 --> 01:36:05,662
Would we be doing this job if the students weren't our main concern?

1121
01:36:06,423 --> 01:36:09,307
Nobody has ever gone into this profession for the money.

1122
01:36:10,008 --> 01:36:14,875
We go into this profession because of our love for the children and our desire to make a difference in the world.

1123
01:36:15,596 --> 01:36:17,579
And as educators, really,

1124
01:36:23,143 --> 01:36:25,205
As educators, we reap many benefits.

1125
01:36:25,666 --> 01:36:31,813
We develop relationships with students and parents that we carry much further than the current year that we have taught these children.

1126
01:36:32,433 --> 01:36:34,556
We receive emails or letters of thanks.

1127
01:36:35,036 --> 01:36:41,343
We get friend requests from former students or parents, and we get visits from students years after they're gone from our classroom.

1128
01:36:41,864 --> 01:36:44,266
We even get invited to weddings and baby showers.

1129
01:36:45,127 --> 01:36:48,068
Undeniably, this is what has pushed educators along.

1130
01:36:48,328 --> 01:36:53,829
And when these things occur, you will hear all educators say, this is what it's all about.

1131
01:36:53,849 --> 01:36:55,769
This is what makes it worth it.

1132
01:36:56,629 --> 01:37:02,650
Unfortunately, as a result of the shifts in education in this pandemic, it's just not enough anymore.

1133
01:37:03,290 --> 01:37:08,691
Our central administration tells us frequently in emails how important we are and how much we are valued.

1134
01:37:09,251 --> 01:37:11,712
This is also not enough.

1135
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,221
We are working harder than we have ever worked before.

1136
01:37:15,661 --> 01:37:18,883
We are faced with challenges we have never come across.

1137
01:37:19,643 --> 01:37:23,025
Nobody comes and asks the educators how things are really going.

1138
01:37:23,765 --> 01:37:28,687
Does our central administration know how far behind these students are academically after this pandemic?

1139
01:37:29,227 --> 01:37:39,352
Do they really know that we are working miracles trying to back teach information while being told to use curriculums that are based on students having a solid foundation of skills?

1140
01:37:39,952 --> 01:37:50,717
Curriculums that were created pre-pandemic, built on assumptions that students have a certain base set of skills that would have to acquire during a succession of regular school years.

1141
01:37:51,317 --> 01:37:53,258
Has anyone told us what we can do about this?

1142
01:37:53,758 --> 01:37:56,159
Have we ever really received guidance on this?

1143
01:37:56,859 --> 01:37:57,860
The answer is no.

1144
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:02,442
So the educators have worked even harder to try to figure things out to fill the gaps.

1145
01:38:03,062 --> 01:38:07,184
We have research and we are supplementing and finding materials on our own time.

1146
01:38:08,124 --> 01:38:16,074
Elementary educators have had to adjust to a new block scheduling that leaves little opportunity to target instruction and differentiate for our students.

1147
01:38:16,794 --> 01:38:23,682
Does the district truly understand that this schedule gives us limited time to work with the many students needing intervention?

1148
01:38:24,263 --> 01:38:27,227
And while central administration has taken steps to address

1149
01:38:28,731 --> 01:38:32,292
the emotional needs of our kids through responsive classroom and nexus?

1150
01:38:33,093 --> 01:38:36,714
Do they really know how things are going after this pandemic?

1151
01:38:37,134 --> 01:38:40,756
Has anyone really asked the educators if it's working?

1152
01:38:41,356 --> 01:38:44,537
Do they understand the trauma that some of our students have been through?

1153
01:38:45,077 --> 01:38:54,341
Do they know that we have students that break down regularly over not getting to be first in line or getting to have a certain color marker because their emotional needs are so high?

1154
01:38:55,021 --> 01:39:00,387
And does the administration understand that these students do not do not know how to be in school learners anymore.

1155
01:39:01,047 --> 01:39:08,996
Do they truly know that these kids are handling socializing difficulty after being isolated for so long, and from having so much screen time.

1156
01:39:09,637 --> 01:39:17,164
Do they know all the work the educators are doing to help their students in crisis that goes far beyond morning meetings and weekly nexus class.

1157
01:39:17,785 --> 01:39:22,707
The answer is no, because central administration is not present in our buildings to see this.

1158
01:39:23,387 --> 01:39:34,872
And does the district reach out and ask the teachers the ramifications of implementing the map testing upon returning from school in a pandemic, when our students are socially and emotionally at risk.

1159
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:42,779
Have they asked about the students that cry because they're taking tests designed to give them questions based on material they've never been taught?

1160
01:39:43,439 --> 01:39:48,004
When teachers asked about this, we were told, hey, tell our students not to worry about that.

1161
01:39:48,664 --> 01:39:54,249
Does central administration know this isn't an answer to give an elementary student with high social emotional needs?

1162
01:39:54,850 --> 01:39:57,671
Do they know how hard this was for the teachers and the students?

1163
01:39:58,171 --> 01:39:59,392
Do they know about the tears?

1164
01:39:59,752 --> 01:40:01,132
Do they know about the meltdowns?

1165
01:40:01,692 --> 01:40:08,195
Do they understand the difficulty and struggle of computer testing kindergarten and first grade students?

1166
01:40:15,640 --> 01:40:17,261
And the answer to this is no.

1167
01:40:17,661 --> 01:40:23,825
Yet they tell us they understand how hard we are working and how hard things are for us, and they value us and all that we do.

1168
01:40:24,606 --> 01:40:30,370
Unfortunately, the sentiment of the teachers right now is that our administration truly does not value us.

1169
01:40:31,070 --> 01:40:40,135
They feel that they are adding more and more to our place, and they just expect us to do all that we're doing because it is our job and because it's all about the children.

1170
01:40:40,575 --> 01:40:42,696
Well, we are doing our job.

1171
01:40:42,917 --> 01:40:43,537
And you know what?

1172
01:40:43,777 --> 01:40:45,458
It is all about the children.

1173
01:40:45,878 --> 01:40:46,979
That's why we're all here.

1174
01:40:47,499 --> 01:40:51,360
That's why we stepped up to the plate and went above and beyond what was asked of us.

1175
01:40:51,780 --> 01:40:59,742
That's why we drove to our students houses, counseled our students, spent hours learning how to teach remotely and found engaging activities.

1176
01:41:00,222 --> 01:41:03,583
That's why we go to school early, and we leave school late.

1177
01:41:04,244 --> 01:41:09,105
That is why we spend our own money to enhance our lessons and make school fun for our students.

1178
01:41:09,805 --> 01:41:24,493
Many of us seek out and pay for our own professional development by becoming active members of various associations, like the International Literacy Association and the National Councils for Teachers of English, Math, Social Studies, and Science.

1179
01:41:24,933 --> 01:41:30,776
It's why we spend our money and time during our summer breaks taking courses to better enhance our teaching.

1180
01:41:31,396 --> 01:41:37,840
It's also why we lose sleep at night worrying about our students, and we try to research proven strategies to help them.

1181
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:45,263
This is why teachers use their personal preparation time to meet the needs of students when they are in social emotional crisis.

1182
01:41:45,764 --> 01:41:53,067
And we are sorry, but telling us that we are valued and appreciated occasionally in an email is just no longer enough.

1183
01:41:53,847 --> 01:41:58,570
This proverbial pat on the back is becoming nothing more than a slap in the face.

1184
01:41:59,330 --> 01:42:01,492
Our district needs to learn what we really do.

1185
01:42:02,053 --> 01:42:06,797
Our central administration needs to show us that we are respected and valued, not just tell us.

1186
01:42:07,397 --> 01:42:12,982
We have worked an entire year without a contract and not one educator has let them affect the quality of their work.

1187
01:42:13,563 --> 01:42:16,746
In fact, this year, Medford's educators worked harder.

1188
01:42:17,346 --> 01:42:20,930
We are overworked, we are underpaid, and we are stressed.

1189
01:42:21,451 --> 01:42:25,676
We are tired, we are getting burnt out, and we are often overwhelmed.

1190
01:42:25,976 --> 01:42:29,781
And yes, we ourselves have been traumatized by this pandemic.

1191
01:42:30,241 --> 01:42:32,824
Yet we show up every day, and we do our best.

1192
01:42:33,265 --> 01:42:34,066
And do you know why?

1193
01:42:34,566 --> 01:42:35,928
Well, that answer is simple.

1194
01:42:36,268 --> 01:42:37,450
It's because of our students.

1195
01:42:38,183 --> 01:42:44,545
We are asking the district to remember this, positive working conditions lead to positive learning conditions for all.

1196
01:42:45,005 --> 01:42:50,888
And when is the central administration going to do more to show us that we really are valued and appreciated?

1197
01:42:51,268 --> 01:42:59,191
And after all we have been through and all that we do, I have to ask, when is it going to be just a little bit about the educators?

1198
01:42:59,851 --> 01:43:00,191
Thank you.

1199
01:43:19,282 --> 01:43:20,783
We have two motions before us.

1200
01:43:20,803 --> 01:43:22,924
We're talking about the free cash paper right now.

1201
01:43:22,964 --> 01:43:25,146
We just have two motions before us to move that through.

1202
01:43:25,186 --> 01:43:26,487
Then we will get to the full budget.

1203
01:43:26,567 --> 01:43:31,530
And I want to make sure you guys can speak, but just trying to move this paper through and then we'll get to the whole budget if that's okay.

1204
01:43:31,610 --> 01:43:36,133
Councilor Carvalho, do you have anything else on the paper before us?

1205
01:43:36,603 --> 01:43:41,791
I just said, Stiglitz made a comment about 15 resignations.

1206
01:43:41,851 --> 01:43:42,792
Is that a normal?

1207
01:43:44,194 --> 01:43:45,115
We always talk about that.

1208
01:43:45,176 --> 01:43:46,698
I know teachers retire every year.

1209
01:43:46,978 --> 01:43:49,281
Is this a normal occurrence every year?

1210
01:43:49,622 --> 01:43:49,782
No.

1211
01:43:50,063 --> 01:43:53,047
So to be perfectly clear, I don't know the exact number.

1212
01:43:53,587 --> 01:43:58,151
I am aware of 10, the people have reached out to me and told me that they're leaving.

1213
01:43:58,451 --> 01:44:00,633
So exactly right now I am aware of 10.

1214
01:44:01,574 --> 01:44:06,197
I have asked for that information and I have not received that information.

1215
01:44:06,617 --> 01:44:14,824
I know there are 14 teachers retiring, two retired in the middle of the year and one will be retiring in October.

1216
01:44:15,988 --> 01:44:18,790
Okay, so the retirements are up.

1217
01:44:18,930 --> 01:44:21,051
The resignations, no.

1218
01:44:21,291 --> 01:44:23,252
I've never seen this many resignations.

1219
01:44:24,573 --> 01:44:25,393
Two, three.

1220
01:44:25,413 --> 01:44:28,835
Okay, but I just wanna make it clear.

1221
01:44:28,875 --> 01:44:29,835
I know of at least 10.

1222
01:44:29,975 --> 01:44:30,596
I know of at least 10.

1223
01:44:31,957 --> 01:44:32,897
Madam President.

1224
01:44:33,397 --> 01:44:34,378
President Bares.

1225
01:44:34,798 --> 01:44:39,000
If we could just get through this paper and get to the budget, then we can talk about all the budget related issues.

1226
01:44:39,020 --> 01:44:41,322
It's just that this is not about the ARPA revenue replacement.

1227
01:44:42,508 --> 01:44:45,289
Oh yeah, I said free cash, I meant ARPA revenue replacement, apologies.

1228
01:44:45,890 --> 01:44:46,850
So we have two motions on the floor.

1229
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:56,634
We have a motion from, we'll take Councilor Carviello's motion first, which is to request from the Federal Funds Manager a full outline of ARPA spending to date, correct Councilor Carviello?

1230
01:44:57,755 --> 01:44:57,995
Yes.

1231
01:44:58,015 --> 01:45:01,977
Okay, so on the motion of Councilor Carviello, seconded by- Second.

1232
01:45:03,357 --> 01:45:04,798
Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

1233
01:45:04,998 --> 01:45:05,358
Aye.

1234
01:45:05,498 --> 01:45:06,179
All those opposed?

1235
01:45:06,259 --> 01:45:06,959
Motion passes.

1236
01:45:07,619 --> 01:45:11,441
Motion on the main paper from Vice President Behrs as seconded by-

1237
01:45:13,323 --> 01:45:15,705
Councilor Night, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

1238
01:45:15,725 --> 01:45:15,785
Yes.

1239
01:45:22,331 --> 01:45:22,692
Yes.

1240
01:45:24,133 --> 01:45:24,353
Yes.

1241
01:45:24,373 --> 01:45:24,633
Yes.

1242
01:45:25,374 --> 01:45:26,015
Yes.

1243
01:45:26,095 --> 01:45:26,275
Yes.

1244
01:45:37,960 --> 01:45:44,982
22-408, to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding the fiscal year 2023 budget submission revised.

1245
01:45:45,542 --> 01:45:56,665
Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter four, section 32, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approve the proposed fiscal year 2023 budget as submitted.

1246
01:45:56,685 --> 01:46:00,006
The total submitted appropriation for all departments, including schools is $201,154,843.02.

1247
01:46:05,067 --> 01:46:19,952
account details will be included within the budget presentation which will be available electronically on June 21 2022 in an interactive and searchable format via the city's website at www.medfordmad.org slash mayor slash city dash budget.

1248
01:46:23,178 --> 01:46:31,123
I just wanna take this time to just disclose that I do have a family member who works in the school system.

1249
01:46:31,923 --> 01:46:37,827
It will not preclude me from voting on the total budget, but I just wanted to make that disclosure.

1250
01:46:38,147 --> 01:46:39,028
Thank you.

1251
01:46:40,168 --> 01:46:41,769
I do have a forest, the entire table.

1252
01:46:42,450 --> 01:46:45,292
I can read it unless counselors would like me not to.

1253
01:46:46,472 --> 01:46:47,033
You want me to read it?

1254
01:46:52,217 --> 01:46:54,118
Yeah, so the total amount for 2023 salaries is $102,065,453.

1255
01:46:54,218 --> 01:46:55,799
And the total amount for 2023 expenses is $99,089,390.02.

1256
01:46:55,839 --> 01:46:58,020
Again, bringing the total proposed budget to $201,154,843.02.

1257
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:01,542
And we do have the mayor before us, if there's any questions from the council before we hear from the mayor.

1258
01:47:20,138 --> 01:47:26,101
Madam Mayor, thank you, President Morrell and city councilors for giving me the opportunity tonight to speak on the fiscal year 23 budget.

1259
01:47:26,881 --> 01:47:39,167
I want to thank everybody who contributed to completing this budget, especially our department heads and our budget team, led by our finance director Bob Dickinson, assistant finance director and budget director Tyler Lovell, and my team in the mayor's office.

1260
01:47:39,427 --> 01:47:46,770
I'm joined by many of our department heads as well as our senior level staff tonight, and we're available to answer any remaining questions you may have.

1261
01:47:47,547 --> 01:47:53,750
This budget season has been tough, and I'm not going to sugarcoat it for you or for those watching or here at home.

1262
01:47:53,770 --> 01:48:06,075
The process of assembling the budget, the decisions, a way to invest, way to scale back, and way to hold are always among the most gut-wrenching and grueling for myself, the finance team, obviously for the council.

1263
01:48:07,090 --> 01:48:11,952
We have in front of you as a result of hours and hours of intense deliberation, debate and due diligence.

1264
01:48:12,352 --> 01:48:20,534
It's a budget that reflects the economic realities that Medford as well as other cities and towns across the Commonwealth and the country are confronting.

1265
01:48:21,294 --> 01:48:33,358
It may not be the budget we all want or we all prefer, but it's the budget that puts the city on the best possible financial trajectory moving forward and allows us to efficiently navigate the continued hardships of the COVID-19 pandemic.

1266
01:48:34,490 --> 01:48:55,050
The major factor impacting this budget is the loss of revenues due to the pandemic, cost escalations as a result of inflation, navigating the federal guidance and the associated availability of using one-time funding to plug revenue gaps, the implications associated, as well as the prolonged period we endured without a finance director.

1267
01:48:55,857 --> 01:49:05,201
Those hurdles coupled with the continuing revenue barriers of the pandemic and the looming recession have made this one of the most difficult that I've experienced since 2008.

1268
01:49:07,802 --> 01:49:11,644
Please know that it was not without trying when it came to hiring a CFO.

1269
01:49:11,824 --> 01:49:13,525
We posted for the job back in July 2021.

1270
01:49:15,148 --> 01:49:24,292
And again, in December of last year, and ultimately came before your honorable body to request an increase in salary as a way to draw in qualified candidates.

1271
01:49:24,792 --> 01:49:27,273
Thank you for approving this on its first reading.

1272
01:49:27,294 --> 01:49:34,837
It's my hope that the council will approve the third reading of the increase in the near future, so we can retain the great candidate we did hire.

1273
01:49:36,025 --> 01:49:40,447
I take responsibility for what might feel and what was a rushed process.

1274
01:49:41,167 --> 01:49:46,069
It is and always is my intention to get the full budget to you sooner as I did the last two years.

1275
01:49:46,869 --> 01:49:56,713
We did meet the legal deadline, but the last two budgets and when presented did set the tone on how it should be done and we will strive to do that next year and into the future.

1276
01:49:57,878 --> 01:50:09,126
Over the past few months, city departments and school departments developed need-based budgets with requests to add to services that department heads recommend, and I too had hoped we could ultimately include.

1277
01:50:10,006 --> 01:50:24,556
Based on the school committee requesting approximately 4.5 million above the fiscal year 22 budget and city departments asking for a combined 1.7 million over last year's budget, plus increases in fixed costs totaling nearly 3.2 million,

1278
01:50:26,681 --> 01:50:30,943
We began with the proposed increase of 9 million above the fiscal year 22 budget.

1279
01:50:32,003 --> 01:50:41,887
I know that it's not new information, because I, along with the chief of staff, Nina Nazarian, have been in frequent communication with you over the last month regarding the fiscal challenges Medford is facing.

1280
01:50:42,588 --> 01:50:46,529
I was before you in early June and laid out these issues and was available for questions.

1281
01:50:47,690 --> 01:50:52,972
As we did for the fiscal year 22 budget, we are committing federal ARPA funds for revenue replacement.

1282
01:50:53,853 --> 01:51:09,697
However, because the allowable percentage to be used for revenue replacement is based on a strict formula that is designed to diminish year over year and is subject to strict federal guidelines, 7.2 million of OPERA will be used to support revenue replacement in this proposed budget.

1283
01:51:10,297 --> 01:51:14,798
This represents an approximate 4.5 million decrease over fiscal year 22.

1284
01:51:15,878 --> 01:51:18,399
This amount or close to it was expected, however,

1285
01:51:19,263 --> 01:51:24,330
because we knew we would have to wean off the use of one-time funds over the four-year period.

1286
01:51:25,501 --> 01:51:31,704
Thankfully, this $1 million budget isn't the only funding source that is helping move our city forward.

1287
01:51:32,625 --> 01:51:54,237
Instead, many critical and significant programs such as park renovations, open space projects, accessibility projects, funding for food insecurity, school projects like the McGlynn Playground Design Study, fire station renovations, historic preservation projects, funding to beautify our squares, housing support monies, tree stump removal, tree planting, and increasing

1288
01:51:54,822 --> 01:52:05,127
Our storm resiliency rely on alternative revenue streams, such as grant funding, CPA funding, opera funding, CDBG funding, and on-call casino revenue sharing.

1289
01:52:05,927 --> 01:52:16,012
Some of these funding sources were vastly underutilized prior to my time as mayor, leaving millions of dollars on the sidelines instead of being actively injected into our community.

1290
01:52:16,824 --> 01:52:19,965
It's important to remember, however, that spending money is not as easy as you think.

1291
01:52:20,785 --> 01:52:22,145
People behind me can tell you so.

1292
01:52:22,565 --> 01:52:25,346
We need to be hypercognizant of what is allowed by law.

1293
01:52:26,566 --> 01:52:31,407
We need smart, thoughtful input and guidance from our hardworking internal staff and external partners.

1294
01:52:31,988 --> 01:52:33,428
And we need the public to be on board.

1295
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:38,069
We're making such amazing progress and are actively applying for more grants every day.

1296
01:52:39,312 --> 01:52:48,475
The budget presented to you today is a comprehensive and fiscally solid proposal that is firmly setting our goals and priorities for fiscal year 23 and beyond on a sound financial footing.

1297
01:52:49,336 --> 01:53:01,700
To give you brief highlights on some of the areas we're prioritizing in this budget proposal, in our parks and playgrounds, we are continuing to leverage a variety of funding sources to make upgrades to or fully renovate most of our open spaces.

1298
01:53:02,441 --> 01:53:06,082
We've already made substantial upgrades to the basketball courts at Barry Park,

1299
01:53:06,687 --> 01:53:11,671
placed at park, as well as expanding accessibility and inclusivity at places like Tufts Pool.

1300
01:53:12,292 --> 01:53:22,860
And I'm happy to say that we are renovating the basketball and tennis courts at Hickey Park, completely redoing Gillis in Carr Park, making improvements at McDonald Park, Riverside Plaza, and so much more.

1301
01:53:24,822 --> 01:53:28,405
We are committed to investing in our stump removal and tree planting operations.

1302
01:53:28,905 --> 01:53:33,869
We are a recently designated Tree City USA and will continue to strive for that distinction in fiscal year 23.

1303
01:53:35,185 --> 01:53:44,369
We're allocating CDBG funding to stump removal and tree planting, primarily in low to moderate income areas in the city, with additional tree planting and stump removal citywide.

1304
01:53:45,070 --> 01:53:57,375
We recently completed 90,000 in CPA funding for trees in our nine parks, including Morrison, and have signed to go to bond with an approval of 250,000 for stump removal.

1305
01:53:57,775 --> 01:53:58,816
Thanks to your approval.

1306
01:53:59,488 --> 01:54:05,430
And I thank you for that approval of the loan order, as well as the loan order to repair a million dollars worth of sidewalks.

1307
01:54:06,450 --> 01:54:12,011
We're making substantial progress, expanding environmental justice and creating a more sustainable and green future for the city.

1308
01:54:12,031 --> 01:54:16,313
We're adding the blue bike network into Medford on both public and private property.

1309
01:54:16,833 --> 01:54:25,255
And we're expanding our bike network by adding more bike lanes, sharrows and other necessary infrastructure to support safe options for biking in and through Medford.

1310
01:54:26,033 --> 01:54:30,736
With analysis and guidance from the pavement and sidewalk assessment, we completed and released last fall.

1311
01:54:31,237 --> 01:54:45,908
And by working with own work Tela and our new engineer and Tim McGivern, our DPW, we're planning and beginning to address the $175 million backlog of roads and sidewalks, repaving projects and upgrades that have been repeatedly ignored for decades.

1312
01:54:46,028 --> 01:54:52,693
And by using the right mix of preventative maintenance and addressing critical repairs first, we can and will begin to tackle this critical issue.

1313
01:54:53,522 --> 01:55:04,925
We are tackling climate change head on by working across departments through a municipal preparedness grant to improve Medford's capacity to prepare for and respond to climate-related natural disasters.

1314
01:55:05,786 --> 01:55:17,089
Through the MVP grant, we're devising plans for community hubs, and we are here to listen and to understand our community's experiences, needs, and ideas as we create better services together.

1315
01:55:18,009 --> 01:55:23,171
We are committed to expanding affordable housing options and limiting the financial burden on families and individuals

1316
01:55:23,653 --> 01:55:24,793
who want to live in Medford.

1317
01:55:25,294 --> 01:55:28,915
We have finalized and submitted our housing production plan to your body for review.

1318
01:55:29,655 --> 01:55:51,544
Additionally, in conjunction with our economic development team, we are continuing to fight for more oversight when it comes to 40B developments, but we've been negotiating with all three developers to re-examine plans that better fit the community's needs, and the ZBA recently announced that it remanded the decision on the Mill Creek development project, and we'll hear proposed updates at a meeting in the near future.

1319
01:55:52,568 --> 01:56:03,957
I'm happy to report that despite the self-imposed guidelines, the school committee overwhelmingly supported a 2.5% increase to the school's budget from fiscal year 22.

1320
01:56:04,477 --> 01:56:11,102
This expansion in funds ensures that our teachers, students, and staff have access to resources and tools that best equip them for success.

1321
01:56:11,903 --> 01:56:21,050
And thanks to the dedicated work of the school committee members, as well as the superintendent, assistant superintendent, and assistant superintendent, we're able to continue to invest in our schools

1322
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:23,841
students and prepare them for the future.

1323
01:56:25,081 --> 01:56:34,226
Since I took office, we've taken a pragmatic and thoughtful approach to the city's finances, which has enabled our free cash reserves to be built up to the highest amount I can recall.

1324
01:56:34,826 --> 01:56:35,866
This is welcome news.

1325
01:56:36,487 --> 01:56:46,171
The next two years, however, will still be challenging in terms of our financial outlook and we will need to access the safety net when compiling the fiscal year 24 and 25 budget.

1326
01:56:48,556 --> 01:56:53,843
Though by then we hope to see some impressive commercial and mixed use development ready to open for the public.

1327
01:56:54,584 --> 01:57:02,695
I'm happy to announce tonight one of those developments will be a second retail marijuana establishment as the second contract was signed yesterday.

1328
01:57:04,458 --> 01:57:18,539
Medford's development potential is huge and developers in large sectors such as life science, manufacturing, biotech, and retail marijuana establishments are taking notice thanks to our efforts of the Economic Development Director and the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability.

1329
01:57:19,305 --> 01:57:38,837
While continuing to protect and enhance residential neighborhoods, Medford's primarily commercial areas such as Mystic Ave, Wellington Circle, and portions of Mystic Valley Parkway and Medford Square are poised for new growth and strategic development that will put Medford on the map, increase our commercial tax base, and bring in new jobs and revenue to the city.

1330
01:57:39,417 --> 01:57:46,742
We are weeks away from putting out an RFI to developers to utilize the air rights we own above the Wellington parking lot.

1331
01:57:47,838 --> 01:57:55,402
We also have big plans in the coming years for a new future of our fire headquarters, more street and sidewalk maintenance work, and a new Medford High School.

1332
01:57:55,962 --> 01:58:03,406
Sustaining a high rating from our bond agencies is critical to supporting the debt we will bring on as a result of undertaking some of these key projects.

1333
01:58:04,847 --> 01:58:14,732
Although we may be going the route of funding a new high school using a request to our taxpayers by different means other than bonding, this is an effective and financially viable tool

1334
01:58:16,366 --> 01:58:24,489
In certain cases, building a future landmark educational facility that would be a gold standard in the state is certainly cause enough to explore this option.

1335
01:58:24,869 --> 01:58:28,770
I've talked about this vision with our community, our parents, our students, our teachers.

1336
01:58:29,630 --> 01:58:34,312
We have to be cognizant not to jeopardize our children's future in Medford by overextending the public now.

1337
01:58:35,445 --> 01:58:50,081
Going to the public today or last month for an override to increase the budget is not something ever requested of me by more than a few people, nor was it something I would decide on over the last few weeks without much thought, discussion, and deliberation.

1338
01:58:50,762 --> 01:58:52,704
It's not a decision I would make in a vacuum.

1339
01:58:53,713 --> 01:59:07,305
As I've said, there are many positives to glean from this budget, and despite the relatively modest increases, we're still able to provide the necessary services to our community, as well as continue to build upon several significant projects and initiatives from last year.

1340
01:59:07,685 --> 01:59:08,326
Almost done, sorry.

1341
01:59:09,107 --> 01:59:14,832
I appreciate the thoroughness and work you all put into these hearings, and I hope that you support this budget so we can get to work for the people.

1342
01:59:14,852 --> 01:59:20,757
I have many other projects to work on over the summer, and I know you have been hard at work on many things, including

1343
01:59:21,137 --> 01:59:24,499
deliberation of over 10 new ordinances yourself.

1344
01:59:25,260 --> 01:59:29,162
Let's work together to create a plan for our future needs starting tomorrow.

1345
01:59:30,163 --> 01:59:49,395
Lastly, I want you to know that I've heard you, I've heard our residents, I'm thankful for your advocacy, and I can now announce that this week we worked hard to adjust and formally recommend an additional $60,000 to part-time salaries for the library from negotiated salaries.

1346
01:59:50,418 --> 02:00:02,067
for Director Kerr to use at her discretion to keep the children's section open, work to hopefully, at least in August, keep our Saturdays open throughout the summer and throughout the fall, winter, and spring.

1347
02:00:03,108 --> 02:00:15,777
Contingent upon the passage of old legal fees and of the city's law budget as proposed by me, I hereby formally recommend a combined total of $40,000 from negotiated salaries and the city's legal budget

1348
02:00:18,092 --> 02:00:25,873
a legislative budget to be used by the council to hire a consultant or attorney to help you finalize the comp plan and housing production plan.

1349
02:00:28,294 --> 02:00:33,175
We have also been working with our team at the schools over the last week and we have heard them.

1350
02:00:33,295 --> 02:00:39,996
We are allocating an additional 300,000 in ARPA monies for essential positions that need to be restored tomorrow.

1351
02:00:41,336 --> 02:00:43,437
I called you all today to recap your priorities.

1352
02:00:43,717 --> 02:00:45,857
Thank you to those who text me back or call me back

1353
02:00:46,145 --> 02:00:50,688
I've heard you over the last three weeks and today, which is why we've made these adjustments.

1354
02:00:51,249 --> 02:00:59,575
It does not cover all of your or my priorities, but I feel I've met the needs that matter to us most to be able to get a better budget approved tonight.

1355
02:01:00,296 --> 02:01:09,883
Thank you for your consideration and for allowing me to present my seven page proposed, my seven page speech this evening, I'm able to take

1356
02:01:10,243 --> 02:01:19,849
questions now before I hand it over to our full financial team, our department heads, I know we have CLA on the call as well for any questions you may have.

1357
02:01:21,109 --> 02:01:21,810
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

1358
02:01:22,850 --> 02:01:24,231
Thank you, Madam President.

1359
02:01:24,271 --> 02:01:25,672
Thank you, Madam Mayor for your presentation.

1360
02:01:25,712 --> 02:01:26,392
It's good to see you.

1361
02:01:27,073 --> 02:01:27,333
You too.

1362
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:39,350
The first thing I just want to say is, you know, certainly I was one to vote for an increase in the CFO salary, but I will say, we've been waiting six months for legal opinion to go to third reading on that.

1363
02:01:39,470 --> 02:01:41,132
So that's been the holdup.

1364
02:01:41,932 --> 02:01:45,275
And you know, the minute we get that, I'm sure that we've moved forward with it.

1365
02:01:47,297 --> 02:01:51,201
We sent several resolutions, this council unanimously sent several resolutions to you.

1366
02:01:54,053 --> 02:01:56,735
last last week, I think, Thursday.

1367
02:01:56,755 --> 02:01:56,815
Yep.

1368
02:01:57,776 --> 02:02:00,378
And you sent us a response today.

1369
02:02:00,398 --> 02:02:04,722
And it largely reflects what you just said to the public.

1370
02:02:06,443 --> 02:02:07,264
specific answers.

1371
02:02:07,304 --> 02:02:07,824
But yes, yes.

1372
02:02:07,864 --> 02:02:08,144
Yeah.

1373
02:02:09,285 --> 02:02:10,927
You know, but on the question of, you know,

1374
02:02:12,933 --> 02:02:24,748
essentially level funding this year, in many cases level funding, potentially next year in many cases because we don't have another way to replace the structural deficit that's currently being filled by ARPA funds.

1375
02:02:25,749 --> 02:02:32,097
Are we potentially going to get a more detailed response by July 14 about how we're going to fill that gap where you know

1376
02:02:32,863 --> 02:02:45,307
We wouldn't hear that, you know, we've heard an overwhelming cry that we need this money for the next two years to avoid further cuts and that many, many, many voters are ready to have the choice before them to fill that in through a prop two and a half override.

1377
02:02:45,327 --> 02:02:52,169
Are we gonna have any sort of more detailed response by July 14th so that this council can feel comfortable not going down that road?

1378
02:02:52,909 --> 02:02:55,510
Yeah, I mean, I think you had mentioned it earlier tonight.

1379
02:02:56,851 --> 02:03:00,352
The fact that we thought we had to use some free cash to get up to that,

1380
02:03:01,792 --> 02:03:06,993
six seven $8 million range in revenue replacement, we don't have to use that this, this year.

1381
02:03:07,734 --> 02:03:24,198
Thankfully, and based on the upper revenue replacement number next year, with some free cash, we're going to need to use, obviously some free cash, but still ween off of one time funds, plus some of the economic development growth that we will see.

1382
02:03:26,401 --> 02:03:42,927
Director Dickinson is going to start tomorrow, I believe I outlined it in my memo to today, start reconciling cash and doing all the things he needs to do so that we can start meeting with department heads as early as early fall to get a better idea of where we are and where we need to be.

1383
02:03:43,768 --> 02:03:44,008
Right.

1384
02:03:44,268 --> 02:03:45,348
And I just asked because.

1385
02:03:47,363 --> 02:03:56,799
You know, at least the top sheet that we got just after June 2 we were looking more like a $205 million total budget at least the original requested maybe it was requested.

1386
02:03:58,328 --> 02:04:01,610
and we're down to 201 proposed, right?

1387
02:04:01,690 --> 02:04:02,771
Yeah, you're right.

1388
02:04:02,831 --> 02:04:04,231
Requested and proposed 201.

1389
02:04:04,872 --> 02:04:10,315
And so, you know, all those needs that we have that the department said, the school sent, you know, that was totally 205.

1390
02:04:10,375 --> 02:04:14,117
That would have been like $12 million structural deficit this year.

1391
02:04:14,877 --> 02:04:20,260
Instead, we're going with this 201 million, which is like a $7.3 million structural deficit this year.

1392
02:04:20,641 --> 02:04:23,462
So the structural deficit is somewhere between 7.3 million and 12 million.

1393
02:04:25,043 --> 02:04:33,705
I guess my question is just, you know, are we going to be able to make that up in fiscal 24 and fiscal 25 without asking the taxpayers to do more?

1394
02:04:55,355 --> 02:05:13,003
Plus new growth, we have to retail marijuana companies, potentially three, and a cultivation site I'm working to negotiate that possibly come online next year to to at least, then we have life science developments we have a number of 40 bees, I know, Director.

1395
02:05:15,647 --> 02:05:28,352
our economic development directors here to maybe speak on in depth about more projects, but new growth goes up, revenues are being replaced, and we're gonna be able to use some ARPA revenue replacement.

1396
02:05:28,632 --> 02:05:38,716
I'm hoping that we, although we may still need to use some free cash, we've built that up, we've budgeted right the last two to three years, thanks to this council who ultimately approved budgets.

1397
02:05:39,837 --> 02:05:43,238
We're hoping with even some use of free cash and one-time funds,

1398
02:05:43,638 --> 02:05:48,982
lower than 7.2, we're going to be able to recover, still have a tough year next year, but recover.

1399
02:05:49,062 --> 02:05:56,407
And then in fiscal year 25, you're going to see new growth skyrocket and hopefully revenues be back to normal.

1400
02:05:57,553 --> 02:06:01,396
I mean I like the idea, but I don't like the word hopefully.

1401
02:06:02,336 --> 02:06:11,583
And, and I guess just my fundamental question is so so basically next year, the ARPA is going to go down we're hoping that revenue goes up, that will allow us to level fund at 201 million.

1402
02:06:11,803 --> 02:06:16,906
Yeah, yeah and I'm always open to any discussions you know you and I've had conversations.

1403
02:06:17,787 --> 02:06:22,190
And so I, so I haven't, so I have with residents and administrators

1404
02:06:23,857 --> 02:06:25,198
I will not do anything.

1405
02:06:25,238 --> 02:06:38,931
We've talked about going to our taxpayers for help to fund a new high school, and we've even talked about streets, but how many times we're gonna go and do that has to be a broader conversation, not only between us, but the community.

1406
02:06:39,291 --> 02:06:48,800
That's ultimately a council vote, but I still wanna be involved in that discussion, and I wanna make sure we take care of our residents that cannot afford it.

1407
02:06:49,714 --> 02:07:09,422
people that are can't afford food rent and the mortgage we just went through a global pandemic and we're heading into a recession with people that can't afford gas in the winter, we need to prepare it's not something I could have done because I was being called out on it a couple weeks ago by, you know, member of the school committee, I wasn't going to make that decision by myself in a vacuum.

1408
02:07:09,902 --> 02:07:11,542
We budgeted, it was hard.

1409
02:07:11,562 --> 02:07:12,823
I know it's been tough

1410
02:07:13,390 --> 02:07:18,254
three weeks you've done your due diligence and I've taken the hits I haven't even dodged them.

1411
02:07:18,274 --> 02:07:24,799
I, that is, that is, I understand that's what has to be done, and you want to spend more than we have.

1412
02:07:25,179 --> 02:07:35,267
And I'm the one person that has to say, it has to, there has to be a limit, because we need to be able to prepare for next year and prepare for the year after that.

1413
02:07:36,059 --> 02:07:54,445
Yeah, I mean, I understand that but something I want to spend more than what we have it's that your departments have said we need to spend more than what we have to fully fund the city services so I'm not going to belabor this point any further I'm going to leave my further comments to after we hear from the public and after I hear from my fellow counselors.

1414
02:07:55,586 --> 02:07:58,547
But, you know, at the end of the day, what I'm hearing is that.

1415
02:07:59,512 --> 02:08:01,713
You know, this year we couldn't do as much as we needed to do.

1416
02:08:02,333 --> 02:08:04,474
Next year, we're not going to be able to do as much as we need to do.

1417
02:08:05,055 --> 02:08:09,177
Maybe the year after we'll be able to do as much as we need to do if what we hope pans out.

1418
02:08:09,637 --> 02:08:12,799
And I don't think that we can afford that, quite frankly.

1419
02:08:13,019 --> 02:08:14,920
I don't think that the citizens of Medford

1420
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:24,946
can afford another year of level funded budgets, which mean effective service cuts, which means we're having people constantly going around and saying, why can't we do this?

1421
02:08:25,006 --> 02:08:25,767
Why can't we do that?

1422
02:08:25,887 --> 02:08:27,528
Why do we have to keep doing more with less?

1423
02:08:27,708 --> 02:08:31,491
So I wish that we were having this conversation four months ago.

1424
02:08:32,471 --> 02:08:33,452
We are where we are now.

1425
02:08:34,333 --> 02:08:35,994
The timeline is what the timeline is.

1426
02:08:36,614 --> 02:08:38,856
That doesn't change the circumstances that we face.

1427
02:08:39,596 --> 02:08:44,720
And if next year we're looking at the same budget this year with another year 8% inflation, that means the budget's going down 8%.

1428
02:08:46,233 --> 02:08:47,914
You know, that's what inflation means.

1429
02:08:47,954 --> 02:08:51,936
You know, our real money goes down every year that costs go up and we don't raise the budget.

1430
02:08:52,556 --> 02:08:56,078
You know, the price of government is the same as the price of anything else.

1431
02:08:56,738 --> 02:08:57,259
It goes up.

1432
02:08:58,359 --> 02:09:04,062
And we have a restriction that no company in this country has, which is 2.5% a year.

1433
02:09:05,123 --> 02:09:08,804
And at a certain point, we're 40 years in now to 2.5% per year.

1434
02:09:10,559 --> 02:09:15,043
And we're to do 40 years into a two and a half year percent per year artificial constraint.

1435
02:09:15,444 --> 02:09:28,977
That means that we have less now than we did in 1983 for our DPW for our fire you know I mean, when I hear Larry tell me how many people used to work at the DPW are fixing the streets of the city and how many people we have now.

1436
02:09:29,938 --> 02:09:33,921
you know, I wasn't there, but I'd like to start moving back in that direction.

1437
02:09:33,941 --> 02:09:35,903
I understand it's a difficult decision.

1438
02:09:36,063 --> 02:09:37,684
I understand there'll be difficult impacts.

1439
02:09:38,364 --> 02:09:40,706
I know that there's ways that we can mitigate those impacts.

1440
02:09:40,886 --> 02:09:43,909
You know, our senior exemption that we have right now is not maximized.

1441
02:09:43,949 --> 02:09:50,454
I have a proposal later on the agenda that if we go this direction, we could maximize the senior exemption and help all of our seniors in this community.

1442
02:09:50,914 --> 02:09:51,675
But at the end of the day,

1443
02:09:52,727 --> 02:10:08,914
The decision that's being put before us is basically another year of the same things that have been happening for the last 30 years, where everybody in the city is basically being asked to do more, more with less, unless they can apply for a grant or find some state funding, or go outside of the city.

1444
02:10:09,634 --> 02:10:14,896
And I think that, you know, at least the residents who talked to me and it's more than a handful are sick and tired of it.

1445
02:10:16,797 --> 02:10:18,118
That's just my position on this.

1446
02:10:18,618 --> 02:10:30,125
My only other question is, you mentioned 60,000 for the library and 40,000 for, sorry, 40,000 for what?

1447
02:10:32,206 --> 02:10:38,730
Contingent upon the passage of old legal fees of the cities in getting the budget that I proposed.

1448
02:10:39,633 --> 02:11:06,786
A few weeks ago, I'm going to recommend a combined total of 40,000 for the city council to hire either whatever type of consultant or attorney you want to do that, but the good work of for housing production plan a comprehensive plan, just as you, you know, I know, I don't know exactly the exact figure that you would like, but I, I want to do that for the council we we gave the housing production plan to you I want you to have the support you need.

1449
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:10,601
take to finalize that so we can move more initiatives forward.

1450
02:11:10,981 --> 02:11:21,665
We have the comprehensive plan which I thank you for serving on that plan and I know you want additional help to work through that 40,000 is a substantial amount of money I think it took

1451
02:11:22,282 --> 02:11:26,805
a year and a half, maybe two to spend that on a zoning consultant, and we appreciate that work that you did.

1452
02:11:27,305 --> 02:11:38,092
We want to be able to provide the city council with that I spoke to a few of you three who made that your top priority and I want to, I want to get a budget passed I want to work together and

1453
02:11:40,274 --> 02:11:42,755
But I mean, I need our legal bills paid.

1454
02:11:42,855 --> 02:11:44,195
I mean, we have to pay our bills.

1455
02:11:44,835 --> 02:11:46,636
I just like you need legal counsel.

1456
02:11:47,056 --> 02:11:55,098
We use legal counsel for negotiating our 40 bees, negotiating retail marijuana license, negotiating the cultivation center.

1457
02:11:55,598 --> 02:11:58,018
And I'm getting hammered if I'm not doing it fast enough.

1458
02:11:58,358 --> 02:12:00,479
But you have to give me the legal means to do it.

1459
02:12:00,879 --> 02:12:03,980
I know I'm an attorney, but I can't do it, do it all myself.

1460
02:12:04,080 --> 02:12:04,380
We have

1461
02:12:05,212 --> 02:12:18,268
5g when our residents were in an uproar, we have somebody from KP that was an expert going to meetings talking to our Tim given who was running those meetings to make sure we were on the best footing as possible, and I could go on and on and on.

1462
02:12:18,609 --> 02:12:23,114
And I know the main sticking point is labor council.

1463
02:12:24,075 --> 02:12:28,117
We're a $200 million organization that never had HR.

1464
02:12:28,638 --> 02:12:31,299
We've never had a labor council.

1465
02:12:31,319 --> 02:12:33,761
We've never had anybody hold anybody accountable.

1466
02:12:34,421 --> 02:12:37,563
I can give you examples that will shake you off your chairs.

1467
02:12:38,103 --> 02:12:41,545
I don't investigate based on one person telling me something.

1468
02:12:41,915 --> 02:12:52,344
I investigate matters based on multiple people from the inside, tell me what's wrong and how bad the morale is in certain departments, because I'm not holding people accountable.

1469
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:54,346
I need to hold people accountable.

1470
02:12:55,463 --> 02:13:00,824
These teachers, I understand that, you know, whatever they're gonna say about me after, but they work every day.

1471
02:13:01,064 --> 02:13:01,905
They have to be there.

1472
02:13:01,925 --> 02:13:07,626
They cannot clock in for an hour, two hours, head up to New Hampshire.

1473
02:13:07,866 --> 02:13:09,026
I'm giving you a random example.

1474
02:13:09,146 --> 02:13:12,327
Head up to New Hampshire and then come back at two o'clock and close out the day.

1475
02:13:12,807 --> 02:13:19,729
And if they did, the superintendent and the assistant superintendent would be calling in the office and holding them accountable.

1476
02:13:20,149 --> 02:13:23,790
I have people that are doing unimaginable things from,

1477
02:13:24,626 --> 02:13:32,628
between racism, not coming to work, I'm gonna hold people accountable, I have to.

1478
02:13:32,648 --> 02:13:35,409
55,000 was approved in January.

1479
02:13:35,709 --> 02:13:39,970
I know you caught it, I watched, but I need you to know that.

1480
02:13:40,990 --> 02:13:45,411
Somebody said to me in one department, we are behind you, we can't say anything, we are behind you 98%.

1481
02:13:45,671 --> 02:13:49,452
And I would wear a cheerleading uniform for you if I could.

1482
02:13:50,478 --> 02:13:53,660
I have people saying, why hasn't X been in the department?

1483
02:13:53,940 --> 02:13:55,060
Why hasn't X been done?

1484
02:13:55,581 --> 02:14:01,044
I'm working on it, but I'm not gonna use you as my witnesses because you'll be retaliated against.

1485
02:14:02,825 --> 02:14:04,345
This city's not in a good place.

1486
02:14:07,467 --> 02:14:08,347
It's not a good place.

1487
02:14:08,387 --> 02:14:09,388
There was no HR.

1488
02:14:10,008 --> 02:14:10,989
Files were empty.

1489
02:14:13,430 --> 02:14:16,952
Please allow me to do my job, please.

1490
02:14:16,972 --> 02:14:18,653
Madam President.

1491
02:14:19,624 --> 02:14:26,388
But just quite frankly, I don't think at least my sticking point has anything to do with Labor Council.

1492
02:14:27,688 --> 02:14:30,550
We came to you, President Morrell and I six months ago and we said,

1493
02:14:31,597 --> 02:14:33,478
We'd like to have a both end approach.

1494
02:14:33,999 --> 02:14:48,209
We understood the argument that there's a need for outside counsel with specific needs, but the city also functioned with an assistant city solicitor for as long as I can remember, to allow that office to function correctly we said, put them both in the budget, I'm all in.

1495
02:14:48,789 --> 02:14:51,511
So I labor council and people accountable.

1496
02:14:52,212 --> 02:14:52,912
That's your job.

1497
02:14:52,932 --> 02:14:54,393
I want you to do your job.

1498
02:14:55,346 --> 02:14:57,147
but we also need to be able to do our job.

1499
02:14:57,707 --> 02:15:01,110
And that means that the law department has the capacity that it needs.

1500
02:15:01,390 --> 02:15:04,311
And that quite frankly, we're hearing it needs from the person who runs the law department.

1501
02:15:05,672 --> 02:15:20,241
So, you know, I just wanted to clarify my question was, it was the 60,000 that we go to the library and then the 40,000 that would come to us, we would call it the zoning phase two based on the comprehensive plan so that we can continue the work that we did in phase one to unlock some great opportunities for the city.

1502
02:15:20,861 --> 02:15:24,504
First comprehensive zoning recodification in 60 years we passed in March.

1503
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:28,462
Um, but my question is, where is this 100,000?

1504
02:15:28,522 --> 02:15:31,764
Is it in the budget proposed before us or is it going to be a supplemental appropriation?

1505
02:15:32,744 --> 02:15:38,928
No, it's gonna if you want to take a vote on it, I'm going to take it from negotiated salaries.

1506
02:15:39,869 --> 02:15:42,870
There's a $500,000 for negotiated salaries in your budget.

1507
02:15:43,090 --> 02:15:46,753
And I it's a tough decision to make.

1508
02:15:47,293 --> 02:15:49,094
But I feel that

1509
02:15:49,768 --> 02:15:53,992
We wanna do what's right, what this council has been asking, what is needed in this community.

1510
02:15:54,492 --> 02:15:56,954
Nobody wants the library struggling.

1511
02:15:57,375 --> 02:16:00,417
Nobody wants you not to be able to move our housing production plan forward.

1512
02:16:01,018 --> 02:16:03,360
So I'm gonna shift it.

1513
02:16:03,620 --> 02:16:05,702
It would be a proposed transfer that we would then approve.

1514
02:16:06,662 --> 02:16:08,704
It would just be an amendment to your budget.

1515
02:16:08,764 --> 02:16:10,386
You can vote the budget as amended.

1516
02:16:11,427 --> 02:16:12,828
Oh, I mean, that's- Councilor Knight.

1517
02:16:15,809 --> 02:16:18,950
Yeah, it's not how I read chapter 44, section 32, but.

1518
02:16:19,530 --> 02:16:26,453
Well, it's my understanding that, and Madam Mayor, thank you for being here, and I appreciate the fact that you've taken the hits you have, I've thrown them at you, you know what I mean?

1519
02:16:26,493 --> 02:16:27,714
Yeah, you're standing here.

1520
02:16:27,734 --> 02:16:29,494
You've thrown some good ones, too.

1521
02:16:29,654 --> 02:16:31,495
I learned from the best, you know, you sat next to me for a while.

1522
02:16:31,515 --> 02:16:32,675
Yeah, I did sit next to you, yeah.

1523
02:16:32,895 --> 02:16:33,396
I missed this.

1524
02:16:33,496 --> 02:16:36,777
So, my question is, looking at,

1525
02:16:38,615 --> 02:16:41,958
Looking at this 500,000 that you're talking about, you're taking out of negotiated salary accounts.

1526
02:16:42,618 --> 02:16:48,583
When the budget was presented, it was presented that there was a 2% cost of living adjustment was penciled into this, right?

1527
02:16:48,624 --> 02:16:51,686
From the negotiated salary accounts across all the open contracts.

1528
02:16:52,267 --> 02:17:03,837
I have to ask the finance team to, we have two expired contracts for negotiating, so that's, I believe that's the main portion of the negotiated salaries, because then the rest of our contracts,

1529
02:17:04,800 --> 02:17:07,883
Maybe it's three, because we did settle one recently.

1530
02:17:08,323 --> 02:17:10,886
The rest of our contracts end in two days.

1531
02:17:11,606 --> 02:17:18,153
So it's for moving forward, but I'm going to have to come, hopefully we settle a bunch, but we're going to have to come before you to get them approved.

1532
02:17:18,673 --> 02:17:22,537
And then if the 400 isn't enough down the line,

1533
02:17:23,497 --> 02:17:24,357
be a free cash paper.

1534
02:17:24,417 --> 02:17:28,478
Right, because what I'm hearing is that we have some money set aside.

1535
02:17:28,498 --> 02:17:36,640
We've already made a commitment that it's going to be 2% cost of living adjustments, and now we're going to take money out of that account to fund these other items.

1536
02:17:36,840 --> 02:17:39,681
So then that would leave less money on the table for these cost of living adjustments.

1537
02:17:39,701 --> 02:17:41,081
No, I don't know if it was a 2%.

1538
02:17:41,502 --> 02:17:43,202
Sorry, it might have just been retro.

1539
02:17:43,262 --> 02:17:44,662
I think that was what I saw.

1540
02:17:44,682 --> 02:17:45,903
Mr. Dickinson also said that.

1541
02:17:46,283 --> 02:17:46,723
I don't know.

1542
02:17:47,873 --> 02:17:55,597
Yeah, Mr. Dickinson said that that was also money for potential back pay because some of the contracts are going into previous fiscal years at this point.

1543
02:17:58,298 --> 02:18:02,180
President Morrell, just confirming that this is retroactive for a couple of contracts that have expired.

1544
02:18:07,589 --> 02:18:09,470
Finance Director Dickinson if he has anything further.

1545
02:18:10,030 --> 02:18:13,031
Right, so what I'm saying, there are some contracts that are gonna be under negotiation right now.

1546
02:18:13,071 --> 02:18:16,813
We put money into a negotiated salaries account to fund, hopefully, a settled contract.

1547
02:18:17,173 --> 02:18:18,654
We've appropriated those funds at 2%.

1548
02:18:18,694 --> 02:18:20,575
Now we're taking money out of that account.

1549
02:18:20,975 --> 02:18:23,496
So there's not gonna be 2% in there for these negotiated contracts.

1550
02:18:23,556 --> 02:18:28,458
Now, quite frankly, I don't think that these men and women that are out working every day, coming to work every day, should take less than 2%.

1551
02:18:28,738 --> 02:18:30,379
They should get more than 2% anyway.

1552
02:18:30,399 --> 02:18:31,680
You know what I mean?

1553
02:18:31,700 --> 02:18:32,420
So if we're taking money.

1554
02:18:39,032 --> 02:18:40,794
All we're doing is robbing Petey to pay Paul, right?

1555
02:18:40,814 --> 02:18:45,438
We're saying make the council happy by giving them this money and opening the library, but now we get the contract problems still on our hands.

1556
02:18:45,458 --> 02:18:48,340
We have open contracts and we're taking money out of negotiated salary accounts.

1557
02:18:48,580 --> 02:18:49,501
It's a tug of war, right?

1558
02:18:50,942 --> 02:18:52,063
It's a zero sum game.

1559
02:18:52,323 --> 02:18:54,245
All we're doing is moving money from this part to this part.

1560
02:18:54,545 --> 02:19:03,873
We're going to negotiate contracts in good faith and we are going to have to come to you for an appropriation if and when they settle at the same time that you approve.

1561
02:19:04,464 --> 02:19:11,347
Right, but what I'm saying is based upon the financial presentation that's been given to us, the future budgeting projection has always been at 2% or more.

1562
02:19:12,027 --> 02:19:23,051
So if we're rating that account and taking $500,000 out of it for an account that's already been looked at for future negotiated contracts, right, at 2%, we have less money in the pot now to spend.

1563
02:19:23,131 --> 02:19:24,392
That we'll have to cover with free cash.

1564
02:19:24,412 --> 02:19:26,732
We'll have to cover with free cash or some other revenue stream, right?

1565
02:19:26,752 --> 02:19:26,813
Yes.

1566
02:19:27,453 --> 02:19:28,053
Okay, thank you.

1567
02:19:29,025 --> 02:19:30,966
Madam President, if I could just finish.

1568
02:19:31,686 --> 02:19:32,706
Thank you for answering the questions.

1569
02:19:32,726 --> 02:19:33,406
I appreciate it.

1570
02:19:35,607 --> 02:19:41,049
I'm going to, again, as I said, leave some comments for after we hear from the public on this budget.

1571
02:19:41,089 --> 02:19:43,110
I know that the public's very involved and engaged on it.

1572
02:19:43,830 --> 02:19:52,653
And I also believe that this council has some potential alternative places where we may be able to look at transferring money instead of from the, what are we calling it?

1573
02:19:53,831 --> 02:19:54,552
Negotiated salaries.

1574
02:19:54,572 --> 02:19:55,733
Negotiated salaries line.

1575
02:19:57,295 --> 02:20:07,107
So, you know, maybe there's some alternatives there, but again, I'm gonna finish my question there, hold my additional comments till after questions from my fellow counselors and public participation.

1576
02:20:08,228 --> 02:20:08,829
Councilor Kerrio.

1577
02:20:11,652 --> 02:20:11,993
Microphone.

1578
02:20:13,417 --> 02:20:14,037
Thank you for coming up.

1579
02:20:14,358 --> 02:20:18,481
I apologize, I wasn't able to call you back today due to my work schedule.

1580
02:20:18,981 --> 02:20:21,763
I know this has always been a tough time.

1581
02:20:22,964 --> 02:20:33,252
We've sat through many budgets before, but I see part of the problem is we haven't had a shovel in the ground in this city in almost four years.

1582
02:20:35,173 --> 02:20:40,537
And that's where our extra money comes from, building pyramid fees and things like that.

1583
02:20:42,006 --> 02:20:52,048
I mean, I know we're starting to do it up, but with other cities and towns around us, we're building, even during the pandemic, look at Malden did, during our pandemic time.

1584
02:20:52,128 --> 02:20:58,110
I mean, we're the last city of any growth, and we haven't had any growth in the last four years.

1585
02:20:59,410 --> 02:21:06,832
I know we're doing it now, but even if we do 10 projects here, we're not gonna see that money for three, four years.

1586
02:21:08,210 --> 02:21:11,052
I mean, I know we're late doing our marijuana stuff.

1587
02:21:12,152 --> 02:21:17,636
Again, by the time those come online, they're going to be a couple of years down the line.

1588
02:21:21,406 --> 02:21:23,428
We'll struggle this year, we're gonna struggle next year.

1589
02:21:24,088 --> 02:21:26,010
And that's the problem.

1590
02:21:26,610 --> 02:21:29,292
Every year we continue to struggle.

1591
02:21:29,312 --> 02:21:32,215
I wish we had more things happening.

1592
02:21:32,535 --> 02:21:38,880
I mean, they're starting to happen now, but they're years away from paying dividends.

1593
02:21:39,681 --> 02:21:40,582
And I think,

1594
02:21:41,767 --> 02:21:50,157
over the years, we should have been developing more, we should have been looking for more opportunities, like I said, cities around us have all done that.

1595
02:21:50,678 --> 02:21:55,763
We built a brand new library, and... May I answer those first two questions?

1596
02:21:55,824 --> 02:21:56,905
Okay.

1597
02:21:56,925 --> 02:21:58,346
Two points.

1598
02:21:59,067 --> 02:21:59,368
First,

1599
02:22:00,779 --> 02:22:02,420
I'll start with the marijuana.

1600
02:22:03,081 --> 02:22:12,807
I was on the council in 2016-17 when we started talking about marijuana, and I know it took four years to work out an ordinance.

1601
02:22:13,387 --> 02:22:18,531
Then we set up a CAC committee, and they took, I think, a year to rank nine committees.

1602
02:22:19,131 --> 02:22:23,214
I received all the applications, piles of applications in the fall.

1603
02:22:24,308 --> 02:22:31,012
Right around election time, I put it off, I didn't, I would never rush it, just because I was getting hammered that I didn't sign a contract yet.

1604
02:22:32,113 --> 02:22:37,816
Right after the holidays, I started negotiating, we signed our first contract in March we signed our second contract.

1605
02:22:38,497 --> 02:22:41,539
Yesterday, I'm already negotiating with a cultivation site.

1606
02:22:42,459 --> 02:22:47,143
and we're gonna start negotiating on third retail spot immediately.

1607
02:22:47,483 --> 02:22:49,565
So I have been thorough.

1608
02:22:50,185 --> 02:22:52,487
You all know what came out last week.

1609
02:22:52,547 --> 02:22:57,731
It's not that it stalled me too much, but it did set me back a few weeks here and there.

1610
02:22:57,751 --> 02:23:02,634
And then to new growth.

1611
02:23:03,315 --> 02:23:08,899
In 2019, our commercial tax base was declining at a rapid rate.

1612
02:23:09,259 --> 02:23:11,501
It's one of the probably three or four reasons

1613
02:23:11,947 --> 02:23:12,447
maybe five.

1614
02:23:12,547 --> 02:23:19,632
One of the five reasons I ran, it's why this council supported adding an economic development director to our staff.

1615
02:23:19,772 --> 02:23:21,293
It's why we're doing a comp plan.

1616
02:23:21,533 --> 02:23:22,974
Yes, it's not gonna happen overnight.

1617
02:23:23,474 --> 02:23:33,161
And I don't know if Victor's still here, but we can list 20 to 30 projects that are in the works that are gonna start coming online in fiscal year 23.

1618
02:23:34,269 --> 02:23:51,918
I mean, I talked to Victor probably two or three times a week on different things, but I think we should have been more proactive over the last couple of years, like I said, because we're not gonna see the fruit of what we're doing now for years coming down the line.

1619
02:23:52,818 --> 02:23:55,119
And that's really been a big thing of mine.

1620
02:23:56,000 --> 02:24:02,043
We built a new library now, and it's not gonna be open on Saturday.

1621
02:24:03,219 --> 02:24:07,808
I mean, I was there two weeks ago with my kids, because they hadn't seen it.

1622
02:24:08,149 --> 02:24:11,195
And I went in there at four o'clock on a Saturday, and it was crowded.

1623
02:24:13,362 --> 02:24:18,966
I mean, you know, not everybody has the opportunity to go away for the summer, and this is a place where they take their children.

1624
02:24:19,346 --> 02:24:27,231
I'd say on a four o'clock on Saturday, I was kind of shocked how many people were in there with their kids, both in the children's part and the adult part.

1625
02:24:28,652 --> 02:24:33,736
I think we need to fund that to at least keep it open on Saturdays during the summer.

1626
02:24:33,956 --> 02:24:37,639
Again, I know you're looking for money everywhere, but, you know,

1627
02:24:38,379 --> 02:24:41,821
That was a 60,000 console cover cover yellow I hear you.

1628
02:24:42,001 --> 02:24:50,226
The first time I learned about the no Saturdays was second week in June, and then last week I did reach out to direct occur who's here saying how much.

1629
02:24:51,606 --> 02:25:09,904
How much do you need to keep the library open on Saturdays, I know there's also not only funding but some staffing concerns, but it's, it's why the 60,000 is in there for Barbara to either work her magic or figure out how we work together to make sure this doesn't happen next summer, and make sure we can keep the library open.

1630
02:25:11,121 --> 02:25:13,603
on the weekends throughout the whole entire year.

1631
02:25:13,924 --> 02:25:24,213
So is this $60,000 gonna be enough to open it for the- It costs about $1,000 to $1,250 each Saturday to open the library.

1632
02:25:25,575 --> 02:25:29,018
So is this gonna be enough funding to manage to get it through most of the summer?

1633
02:25:31,326 --> 02:25:42,511
If Director Kerr can get the staffing, and I don't think that's gonna be beginning of July, but if Director Kerr can get the staffing, I would hope that we'll be able to work out with current employees and part-time employees.

1634
02:25:42,571 --> 02:25:48,954
I know we're interviewing for additional employees that we'll be able to work something out as soon as possible.

1635
02:25:48,974 --> 02:25:51,395
I'm really shocked with the ballooning law budget.

1636
02:25:51,575 --> 02:25:52,635
It just keeps going higher.

1637
02:25:52,955 --> 02:25:56,417
I gotta say, I'm kind of mortified when we got this tonight.

1638
02:25:57,380 --> 02:26:05,343
I mean, this is, I don't know, I don't know what the reasons for this, this package that we received tonight, which is really shocking to me.

1639
02:26:05,724 --> 02:26:11,666
Councilor Carvillo, when you're trying to hold people accountable, that's the result.

1640
02:26:12,086 --> 02:26:12,707
It's hard work.

1641
02:26:12,767 --> 02:26:17,629
But I'm not gonna back down from hard work if it's gonna help the city.

1642
02:26:17,649 --> 02:26:18,769
I didn't have the opportunity to read it.

1643
02:26:18,869 --> 02:26:22,271
I'd say, you know, I just, I got it tonight, but let's say,

1644
02:26:23,692 --> 02:26:30,355
They're ULPs, so you'll read them, but you'll understand, hopefully they're not redacted enough.

1645
02:26:30,415 --> 02:26:32,655
You'll get a full picture once you read those.

1646
02:26:33,736 --> 02:26:37,377
And I'm also troubled about, you know, we don't, we're still lacking department heads.

1647
02:26:38,297 --> 02:26:42,379
Yeah, I mean, why aren't, I mean, are we not paying enough money?

1648
02:26:43,099 --> 02:26:48,541
I mean, if we walk through this building, it's a ghost town, it really is.

1649
02:26:50,361 --> 02:26:52,442
There's really just, there's not a lot of people working here.

1650
02:26:53,377 --> 02:27:03,364
We just hired our veterans director that you thankfully helped us interview, we hired our CFO, we hired a CFO, we had a recent very quick retirement in our billing department.

1651
02:27:03,624 --> 02:27:06,286
We have an acting assessor, Ellen, she's on the call.

1652
02:27:06,426 --> 02:27:08,687
I know, but an acting assessor is an assessor.

1653
02:27:08,967 --> 02:27:11,269
Finance positions are hard to find.

1654
02:27:11,289 --> 02:27:13,931
We don't have an IT person in the building.

1655
02:27:14,971 --> 02:27:16,913
IT will be posted in the next,

1656
02:27:18,212 --> 02:27:19,133
two, three, four weeks.

1657
02:27:19,473 --> 02:27:22,254
I mean, you know, these are, I mean, this is this is how this building runs.

1658
02:27:22,314 --> 02:27:29,758
I mean, I mean, every, every year the amount of employees in this building keeps on going down and down.

1659
02:27:30,758 --> 02:27:33,139
And that that's really and it's it can't go down.

1660
02:27:33,559 --> 02:27:36,581
It comes to bear says, you know, we're a $200 million company here.

1661
02:27:37,261 --> 02:27:38,922
And, and we're not growing.

1662
02:27:39,882 --> 02:27:41,063
like a $200 million commitment.

1663
02:27:41,423 --> 02:27:45,567
You know, I'm just a little disappointed that we haven't developed anything in four years.

1664
02:27:46,288 --> 02:28:01,802
And I'm afraid it's going to be too little too late, because we're not going to see that we're not going to see the fruits of this, of all the dividends that this work the council did, especially when we've already approved to in the private will come in for at least three or four years.

1665
02:28:02,522 --> 02:28:06,864
And, you know, and we're talking about, you know, a school, fire station.

1666
02:28:07,305 --> 02:28:09,826
I mean, how do you have a school if we're losing teachers?

1667
02:28:11,767 --> 02:28:13,368
You know, we want to build a new school.

1668
02:28:13,388 --> 02:28:20,712
We have to have teachers to fill it up with.

1669
02:28:20,752 --> 02:28:22,053
We are 10 legs of nations this year.

1670
02:28:23,113 --> 02:28:26,355
I don't know how that happens every other year, but I guess 10 is high.

1671
02:28:27,336 --> 02:28:30,537
And they're not counting the retirees that are already left.

1672
02:28:32,498 --> 02:28:36,941
Yeah, I mean, those are really the things that have bothered me from what I've seen, so.

1673
02:28:37,301 --> 02:28:37,581
Thank you.

1674
02:28:37,621 --> 02:28:46,827
And again, I know you've worked hard on this, but you've done it before, and you've been doing this for 20 years.

1675
02:28:46,847 --> 02:28:47,867
Come on.

1676
02:28:48,048 --> 02:28:49,308
Every year, it gets harder every year.

1677
02:28:50,609 --> 02:28:51,650
Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

1678
02:28:52,090 --> 02:28:52,971
Thank you, Councilor Carvillo.

1679
02:28:53,131 --> 02:28:54,211
Councilor Scarapelli.

1680
02:28:54,231 --> 02:28:55,132
Thank you, Madam President.

1681
02:28:55,152 --> 02:28:58,034
So first, thank you very much, Madam FBNA.

1682
02:28:58,054 --> 02:28:58,734
This isn't easy.

1683
02:28:59,014 --> 02:29:01,076
I know it isn't easy, but I'm gonna,

1684
02:29:02,137 --> 02:29:13,451
My fellow counselors have identified different areas that have been bothersome or questionable that they brought forward.

1685
02:29:13,491 --> 02:29:14,332
I'm not gonna do that.

1686
02:29:15,834 --> 02:29:20,600
The first meeting I talked about passionately, talked about the lack of

1687
02:29:22,110 --> 02:29:26,871
your office and this body to work together to share in the failures and the successes.

1688
02:29:27,671 --> 02:29:30,912
I was lucky enough to sit next to you for many years and learn a lot from you.

1689
02:29:31,612 --> 02:29:32,773
And I watched your passion.

1690
02:29:34,113 --> 02:29:40,554
And my passion was by your chief of staff was promoted that it was bullying.

1691
02:29:41,675 --> 02:29:45,096
And I found a fence to that because she's one of your leaders.

1692
02:29:46,036 --> 02:29:50,677
And when you look at the situation that we're in, I find it difficult that

1693
02:29:52,468 --> 02:30:06,095
That you're coming here tonight, and you're expressing a deep passionate expression of what is important what's happened and that would have been great six months ago, as each situation came about, as we will talk as we wanted.

1694
02:30:06,655 --> 02:30:12,498
When we were colleagues, we talked about that, having that line of communication, working together.

1695
02:30:13,458 --> 02:30:30,084
where we can sit and talk about this and understand that, hey, we need these legal fees because of X, Y, and Z. And I know what personal matters, but it's also understanding in executive session, what the city, why we're moving forward.

1696
02:30:30,504 --> 02:30:31,505
I had non-negotiables.

1697
02:30:31,845 --> 02:30:34,806
I had non-negotiables and I apologize, I didn't get back to you today.

1698
02:30:35,446 --> 02:30:39,248
I got into a little fender bender, thank God everything's okay, but I couldn't get back to you.

1699
02:30:41,328 --> 02:30:45,489
Tonight, you couldn't give me the answers for what I want, my non-negotiables.

1700
02:30:46,109 --> 02:30:49,810
My number one non-negotiable is having legal representation here.

1701
02:30:50,630 --> 02:30:51,730
And we talked about that.

1702
02:30:51,910 --> 02:30:53,330
We expressed that need.

1703
02:30:53,390 --> 02:30:58,992
It was $50,000 that we looked into that because I give you the example, the BJ situation.

1704
02:31:00,012 --> 02:31:02,292
We answered a question illegally.

1705
02:31:03,112 --> 02:31:05,773
So held this city, this council,

1706
02:31:06,769 --> 02:31:08,209
and a negative light to the courts.

1707
02:31:08,850 --> 02:31:11,691
So there's no way we're gonna win because we presented it wrong.

1708
02:31:12,171 --> 02:31:18,673
Where if we had council, those are little things, that's just little things that could lead us where we need to be led.

1709
02:31:19,653 --> 02:31:24,635
There were times we wanna go to executive session because this council looked unprepared.

1710
02:31:26,115 --> 02:31:27,576
And we didn't have that guidance.

1711
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:31,397
And we didn't have that partnership.

1712
02:31:32,757 --> 02:31:35,080
My other non-negotiables are educators.

1713
02:31:35,540 --> 02:31:36,341
Can I speak to that?

1714
02:31:36,361 --> 02:31:44,631
Yeah, sure.

1715
02:31:44,751 --> 02:31:46,173
Oh, I do actually do have a pen, sorry.

1716
02:31:50,752 --> 02:32:06,561
I just want to go back to fiscal year 22 budget, when it was a priority of this council and to have legal counsel and I made a promise that KP law would be at meetings that are requested of them to be to talk and speak to issues that are important to you.

1717
02:32:07,218 --> 02:32:09,219
And I feel like I've kept that commitment.

1718
02:32:09,299 --> 02:32:23,003
I know that 10 to 12, 13 ordinances have been written for this body, and that we have, between city solicitor Scanlon and myself, we've made sure that you've had access to KPLR at any meeting you so requested.

1719
02:32:23,103 --> 02:32:32,206
I don't know when the gas station meeting was, but if that was within the last fiscal year, we would have had counsel there for you, because I appreciate that.

1720
02:32:32,246 --> 02:32:36,648
I know what it's like, and I know you need counsel when you may ultimately be sued.

1721
02:32:37,028 --> 02:32:49,694
And we want to continue to provide that to you, but you just want to make that clear I feel like we've kept the promise I've heard today that some of the follow up after those meetings needs to be better and I will communicate that and make sure it happens.

1722
02:32:50,735 --> 02:32:59,499
But we've given you access and in 21 years that's the most access to counsel that I could ever ever ever recall as a city council.

1723
02:32:59,539 --> 02:33:00,860
Okay, so, so with that.

1724
02:33:02,639 --> 02:33:08,264
We have questions because we're not meeting with you, or we're not getting the answers we need that we've requested.

1725
02:33:08,925 --> 02:33:19,355
So, normally we would call a city solicitor city so sister city solicitor that would return our calls and answer our calls, or that there weren't overwhelmed.

1726
02:33:19,375 --> 02:33:24,299
I think Councilman he's not, he's telling the truth when it says when we.

1727
02:33:25,363 --> 02:33:31,286
when the council from KP Law stated that they don't work for us, they work for you.

1728
02:33:32,006 --> 02:33:52,175
So what hurts us is, okay, so we have a question that deals with our body and we're not getting the answers because KP Law, sure they were there for X, Y, and Z, but I will tell you, the most impactful attorney that's moved this city forward in many years,

1729
02:33:53,227 --> 02:33:55,250
was zoning consultant, Mr. Bobowski.

1730
02:33:56,031 --> 02:34:06,345
And as we move forward to the next step of that we asked for funding, a lot of funding $50,000 I don't think it's a lot of funding we talked about the big scope of of new growth.

1731
02:34:08,853 --> 02:34:09,673
It was bypassed.

1732
02:34:10,194 --> 02:34:14,336
So when we're talking about legal representation for the council, they haven't seen that.

1733
02:34:14,676 --> 02:34:18,298
Like I said, the other piece of this is our teachers.

1734
02:34:18,938 --> 02:34:19,879
You know my background.

1735
02:34:20,319 --> 02:34:21,900
I was a former teacher for 15 years.

1736
02:34:22,520 --> 02:34:23,641
I was lucky enough to coach you.

1737
02:34:24,061 --> 02:34:27,723
I was involved in the schools as a school committee member for many years.

1738
02:34:28,664 --> 02:34:29,504
I know what it takes.

1739
02:34:29,564 --> 02:34:30,945
It's a backbone of our community.

1740
02:34:32,045 --> 02:34:36,808
And when you talk about your staff here feeling underappreciated,

1741
02:34:38,280 --> 02:34:40,060
Have you heard what they're saying behind you?

1742
02:34:40,941 --> 02:34:42,461
The morale is very low.

1743
02:34:43,341 --> 02:34:44,762
My daughter goes to school there.

1744
02:34:44,822 --> 02:34:46,322
I'm sure your kids go to school there.

1745
02:34:46,642 --> 02:34:47,242
They see it.

1746
02:34:47,983 --> 02:34:58,826
I hear horror stories from neighbors about paraprofessionals being treated like trash, being beaten up by students, and it's difficult to hear.

1747
02:34:59,726 --> 02:35:03,867
And it's difficult to look at my fellow colleagues in the eye when they're telling me, George, you know what?

1748
02:35:04,207 --> 02:35:04,827
I'm just leaving.

1749
02:35:05,687 --> 02:35:06,368
I'm retiring.

1750
02:35:08,817 --> 02:35:13,078
I trust and I know that helping our community move forward.

1751
02:35:13,839 --> 02:35:19,941
So I don't, I know, I'm not gonna beat up the school administration, I'm not gonna beat up the school committee.

1752
02:35:20,561 --> 02:35:25,222
They're doing a very, they're doing what they have, what they're given.

1753
02:35:25,902 --> 02:35:36,886
I'm just telling you, I just think, especially for what we went through in the last few years, and the people that are on the front line every single day aren't being,

1754
02:35:38,142 --> 02:35:40,704
aren't being given the respect they deserve.

1755
02:35:40,804 --> 02:35:42,665
And that's why, and that's not a political ploy.

1756
02:35:42,745 --> 02:35:45,587
I'm telling you, this is what I feel as a former teacher.

1757
02:35:46,127 --> 02:35:48,849
I saw what my family members do as teachers.

1758
02:35:49,269 --> 02:35:51,811
I saw what colleagues have done during the pandemic.

1759
02:35:52,151 --> 02:35:52,852
It's difficult.

1760
02:35:53,372 --> 02:35:54,012
And you thought that,

1761
02:35:55,013 --> 02:35:57,556
everybody thought we'd find a way to support them.

1762
02:35:57,837 --> 02:35:58,678
And we haven't done that.

1763
02:35:58,698 --> 02:35:59,859
So I'll be honest with you.

1764
02:35:59,899 --> 02:36:03,143
I don't feel I know.

1765
02:36:04,044 --> 02:36:06,066
Just as it relates to the budget.

1766
02:36:06,126 --> 02:36:11,853
I hear you as it relates to the 15-20 contracts that we need to negotiate.

1767
02:36:12,254 --> 02:36:13,736
That's contract negotiations.

1768
02:36:13,956 --> 02:36:14,757
Like it's not

1769
02:36:16,313 --> 02:36:35,086
It's not about the budget, that's gonna be- I know, I know, but it's something that I know that- When I come to you and ask for you to codify them and ask you for some funds to be able to finish these contracts out, then I hope you support it, but I can't imagine why you wouldn't vote for a budget, it's contract negotiation.

1770
02:36:35,126 --> 02:36:42,691
Like I said, and this isn't a slight, I know it's because it's a totally different job than where you were when you're sitting there.

1771
02:36:43,729 --> 02:36:46,692
But you wouldn't accept what's going on here today.

1772
02:36:47,273 --> 02:37:00,026
I know that I know that the person I sat with couldn't wouldn't deal with the budget being given such a late time that staff members coming up and disrespecting this body, shutting us down.

1773
02:37:00,847 --> 02:37:03,289
belittling us, that's unacceptable.

1774
02:37:03,389 --> 02:37:04,529
So this is how we feel.

1775
02:37:04,789 --> 02:37:06,691
I know that comments have been made.

1776
02:37:06,911 --> 02:37:12,874
I know comments have been made that, you know, your department heads feel that we are very aggressive and they don't want to come to us.

1777
02:37:13,495 --> 02:37:19,398
You know what, it feels both ways when we ask the simplest questions and the simplest requests and we get nothing back.

1778
02:37:20,279 --> 02:37:21,680
So, and I don't know why that's happening.

1779
02:37:22,040 --> 02:37:29,805
So, you know, there's a lot of, there's a lot of healing that has to get done, but in the case of the budget itself,

1780
02:37:30,892 --> 02:37:38,498
There are things that I just haven't seen that are going to give me the ability to move this in a positive light in my eyes.

1781
02:37:38,558 --> 02:37:41,440
So I just want to let you know that face-to-face.

1782
02:37:41,480 --> 02:37:41,960
So thank you.

1783
02:37:52,488 --> 02:37:53,208
Thank you.

1784
02:37:53,248 --> 02:37:56,331
Thank you for your participation on the budget paper.

1785
02:38:01,725 --> 02:38:03,245
And then folks on Zoom, raise your hand.

1786
02:38:03,346 --> 02:38:08,927
Folks in person, feel free to line up or take turns and come to the podium, please.

1787
02:38:09,968 --> 02:38:12,068
Nicole, President Morrell, you have a question for me?

1788
02:38:12,088 --> 02:38:13,789
Do you have a question for me?

1789
02:38:14,209 --> 02:38:14,689
I do not, no.

1790
02:38:14,869 --> 02:38:15,629
I do not, thank you.

1791
02:38:15,669 --> 02:38:17,390
Yeah, I'm gonna stack up one more.

1792
02:38:18,190 --> 02:38:18,490
Thank you.

1793
02:38:18,510 --> 02:38:20,211
We're taking participation from the public.

1794
02:38:20,251 --> 02:38:21,831
We hope that everyone will stay to hear it.

1795
02:38:21,851 --> 02:38:25,353
Name and address for the record, please.

1796
02:38:25,593 --> 02:38:27,073
Hi, I'm Riley Jones.

1797
02:38:27,253 --> 02:38:28,874
I live at 137 Fulton Street.

1798
02:38:31,446 --> 02:38:34,568
I have been a social studies teacher at Medford High School for five years.

1799
02:38:35,168 --> 02:38:36,388
I love my job.

1800
02:38:36,869 --> 02:38:38,670
I identify with my job.

1801
02:38:38,690 --> 02:38:42,551
I wouldn't know what my life would be like without my job.

1802
02:38:43,452 --> 02:38:44,692
I also love my students.

1803
02:38:45,353 --> 02:38:49,195
They know that I love them because I tell them as often as I can.

1804
02:38:49,875 --> 02:38:53,817
I seek within my job to show my students how much I love them every day.

1805
02:38:55,117 --> 02:38:56,298
Teaching is a full-time job.

1806
02:38:57,936 --> 02:38:58,916
That's an obvious statement.

1807
02:38:59,556 --> 02:39:01,177
You don't need me to tell you that.

1808
02:39:01,897 --> 02:39:05,198
What isn't obvious about teaching is that it is a full life job.

1809
02:39:05,858 --> 02:39:09,719
You never stop thinking about your job when your job involves young people who need you.

1810
02:39:11,119 --> 02:39:14,400
Every spare thought, moment and idea turns to teaching.

1811
02:39:15,180 --> 02:39:21,462
You are swallowed by the holistic nature of teaching and it dominates every waking and a lot of dreaming moments in your life.

1812
02:39:22,642 --> 02:39:26,083
The unspoken understanding of teaching is that most of your labor is free.

1813
02:39:27,093 --> 02:39:34,699
The common refrain of, but you get your summers off, is thrown at every teacher at almost every corner of their career.

1814
02:39:34,739 --> 02:39:40,464
But no one asks about the amount of unpaid labor that exists throughout the year.

1815
02:39:41,845 --> 02:39:43,246
We don't get our summers off, by the way.

1816
02:39:43,546 --> 02:39:48,270
That's the lie that we tell our young teachers to try and coax them into the profession.

1817
02:39:48,770 --> 02:39:51,633
And as we can see, that's not really working right now.

1818
02:39:53,127 --> 02:39:57,230
Every day, I start my day almost 30 to 45 minutes early at minimum.

1819
02:39:57,950 --> 02:40:09,738
I need to open my room so that my students can have a safe space to eat their breakfast, break down their concerns about their schoolwork, talk with me about their troubles at home, or just soak in all of the love they can before they start their day.

1820
02:40:10,819 --> 02:40:19,545
During lunch, I ask my students to leave and break their hearts because I need to recharge my batteries and talk with my coworkers since it's the only time I can breathe during the day.

1821
02:40:23,953 --> 02:40:27,695
I can't utilize my prep because I'm asked to cover and substitute.

1822
02:40:28,596 --> 02:40:34,759
After school, I do a lot of the same things I do before school, except generally I have three to four more students in the room.

1823
02:40:35,880 --> 02:40:47,326
I run a club that I am not paid for because I want there to be a safe space for my Dungeons and Dragons club members to role play, create characters, develop their worlds and live in them.

1824
02:40:49,227 --> 02:40:50,448
And they do, they live in them.

1825
02:40:51,873 --> 02:41:04,129
Sometimes I have to run around the school looking for administrators because I caught two students arguing and there's no student, there's no one to counsel them since there aren't enough counselors and they already have students to tend to.

1826
02:41:04,810 --> 02:41:07,774
At night, I grade, I plan, I answer emails.

1827
02:41:08,955 --> 02:41:09,556
It never stops.

1828
02:41:10,911 --> 02:41:13,612
I know this, I understand my job.

1829
02:41:13,632 --> 02:41:14,513
I know what it entails.

1830
02:41:14,673 --> 02:41:22,217
And to some degree, I would be okay with that if I could afford to live a life with just the job of a teacher.

1831
02:41:25,158 --> 02:41:26,399
Except I can't afford this life.

1832
02:41:27,119 --> 02:41:29,540
I can't afford to be just a teacher.

1833
02:41:31,081 --> 02:41:36,844
One of the true cruelties in this world is that I want to live this life, but it doesn't want me.

1834
02:41:37,624 --> 02:41:39,045
It doesn't prioritize me.

1835
02:41:39,245 --> 02:41:40,406
It doesn't pay me.

1836
02:41:41,337 --> 02:41:44,198
I work three nights a week at a restaurant as a bartender and a waitress.

1837
02:41:44,678 --> 02:41:46,879
I'm a paid member of our Teachers Union executive board.

1838
02:41:47,679 --> 02:41:49,280
I am doing summer school this year.

1839
02:41:49,720 --> 02:41:52,661
I'm currently working, I guess, four jobs.

1840
02:41:53,261 --> 02:42:00,684
And the idea of having to get my graduate degree, a necessity for my job, is so daunting that I regularly fall apart just thinking about it.

1841
02:42:02,012 --> 02:42:10,418
I spend so many hours of my life doing work to live the life of a teacher that has absolutely no connection to educating.

1842
02:42:10,758 --> 02:42:12,059
I am exhausted.

1843
02:42:13,100 --> 02:42:17,863
I don't get to do the work that I love because I'm too busy doing work to stay in the black.

1844
02:42:18,804 --> 02:42:29,831
I want to spend every ounce of my energy teaching, but I am forced to spend my life bartending to sustain the vocation that I am talented at, the vocation that I love, and the vocation that is most useful to this world.

1845
02:42:30,837 --> 02:42:32,858
My students know that I serve and bartend.

1846
02:42:33,639 --> 02:42:36,761
They know I'm cranky on Fridays because I work the night before.

1847
02:42:37,041 --> 02:42:41,644
They know my back hurts because I stand behind a bar and walk to take orders.

1848
02:42:42,144 --> 02:42:48,408
They know it takes me longer to grade their papers because I was making drinks and serving food the night before.

1849
02:42:49,169 --> 02:42:54,912
Some have even come by the restaurant with their families and encouraged their caregivers to tip me well so that I can save money.

1850
02:42:56,913 --> 02:42:57,714
It's humiliating.

1851
02:43:00,652 --> 02:43:12,075
Knowing that I am pitied by my students and that I have to look into the eyes of their caregivers and show them what their school system has forced me to do is yet another exhausting part of my job.

1852
02:43:13,416 --> 02:43:15,776
I shouldn't have to serve my students' families.

1853
02:43:15,876 --> 02:43:22,038
I shouldn't have to serve school committee members or the head of the Department of Education, which I have done.

1854
02:43:23,430 --> 02:43:28,352
Yet I am failed by the superintendent, the school committee, and this mayor every single day.

1855
02:43:28,372 --> 02:43:33,734
I set a plate or a drink in front of them instead of getting paid a reasonable living wage.

1856
02:43:34,335 --> 02:43:37,196
I deserve a wage that reflects the increase in the cost of living.

1857
02:43:37,816 --> 02:43:41,278
I don't deserve platitudes about how there isn't any money for me.

1858
02:43:41,678 --> 02:43:47,280
Believe me, I have been aware of how little money there is for me the entire time I have worked this job.

1859
02:43:49,381 --> 02:43:50,602
I don't want your pity tips.

1860
02:43:51,581 --> 02:43:56,446
I want a wage that reflects the hard work and dedication I put into the Medford Public Schools.

1861
02:43:57,828 --> 02:43:59,950
Treat me with respect and let me teach.

1862
02:44:01,332 --> 02:44:02,533
Let me love my job.

1863
02:44:03,674 --> 02:44:05,657
Let me love and support your students.

1864
02:44:06,558 --> 02:44:06,838
Thank you.

1865
02:44:20,262 --> 02:44:21,062
Thank you so much.

1866
02:44:21,283 --> 02:44:26,386
I apologize for not saying this before, and I especially apologize for saying it after such a powerful speech.

1867
02:44:26,806 --> 02:44:33,210
If we could try to keep comments to three minutes just to respect the time, but that was worth every second.

1868
02:44:33,310 --> 02:44:34,310
Thank you.

1869
02:44:34,430 --> 02:44:35,731
Name and address for the record, please.

1870
02:44:36,732 --> 02:44:38,693
My name is Kate Willard.

1871
02:44:38,893 --> 02:44:45,337
I live at 10th Lawrence Street, and I have been a special educator at the Andrews Middle School for the past eight years.

1872
02:44:46,768 --> 02:44:56,596
I stand here today worried about the future of Medford students, as we teachers, paraprofessionals, and support staff are asked to do ever more each year with less and less support.

1873
02:44:57,538 --> 02:45:05,407
At the end of the school year, two exceptional teachers who have been in the district for 16 and 11 years resigned from my school.

1874
02:45:06,208 --> 02:45:17,420
While their colleagues, including me, feel their tremendous loss for AMS, their resignations were met with little to no acknowledgement from their administrators.

1875
02:45:18,858 --> 02:45:25,662
Both are moving on to other districts where they hope their profession and students are better valued and supported.

1876
02:45:26,123 --> 02:45:34,688
But our own students will now miss out on their positive community leadership and expert teaching because they did not feel valued here.

1877
02:45:36,203 --> 02:45:42,787
Due to resignations, retirements, and non-renewals, we now have half of our math positions to fill for next year.

1878
02:45:43,247 --> 02:45:58,596
Yet instead of supporting veteran staff or mentoring new teachers, the emphasis for addressing learning loss in math and other areas was on pushing more standardized testing on students we already knew were behind due to the pandemic disruptions.

1879
02:45:59,443 --> 02:46:07,731
This testing initiative was no more a solution to this problem than training teachers how to administer it was professional development.

1880
02:46:08,812 --> 02:46:18,081
It instead took time away from student learning and from more useful professional training to support teachers in the most challenging school year of our careers.

1881
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:34,707
At the Andrews, we are now also down a PE and tech lab teacher for the coming year, making it unclear how our students will receive all of their STEM content or how one teacher can be asked to manage PE classes of over 40 middle school students.

1882
02:46:35,688 --> 02:46:45,233
We are down a student adjustment counselor when it was absolutely vital to fill this position this year for our most vulnerable students.

1883
02:46:46,487 --> 02:46:51,170
We had limited access to our own library this year due to staffing shortages.

1884
02:46:51,910 --> 02:46:58,475
Once an environment of vibrant learning and collaboration, the library stood silent and empty more days than not.

1885
02:46:59,175 --> 02:47:06,440
The only intermittent buzz being requests for Chromebooks, a task no librarian wants as their primary job.

1886
02:47:08,695 --> 02:47:09,815
You have about a minute left.

1887
02:47:10,235 --> 02:47:19,678
Due to a lack of planning for maternity leave, one special educator had to cover two caseloads of students on IEPs and inclusion settings this spring.

1888
02:47:20,178 --> 02:47:25,019
A planning solution for staffing I've seen more than once in my tenure just at the Andrews.

1889
02:47:25,759 --> 02:47:38,442
This kind of planning along with putting the burden of daily absences on other teachers instead of raising compensation to attract substitutes is why are we sure to lose more teachers in the coming years?

1890
02:47:39,683 --> 02:47:46,449
I've seen my school flourish, so the contrast of it quite literally falling apart has been hard to witness.

1891
02:47:47,030 --> 02:47:52,675
As of the last day of school, we have had a broken railing on a side staircase since February.

1892
02:47:52,695 --> 02:48:02,465
Our HVAC system left teachers and students on the third floor in temperatures above 80 degrees this spring, and we have cameras that don't work at key entry points.

1893
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:15,706
This year, we have more behavioral referrals than ever before, many of them escalating further as the year progressed rather than subsiding as student needs are usually met through the development of appropriate behavior.

1894
02:48:16,906 --> 02:48:24,390
In all of these cases, those making decisions at the top are not in communication with those of us working directly with students.

1895
02:48:25,030 --> 02:48:29,372
They may hear our pleas, but their inaction shows they have not listened.

1896
02:48:30,172 --> 02:48:33,714
Staff morale at the Andrews and across the district is low.

1897
02:48:33,994 --> 02:48:41,257
We are burnout and exhausted from the stresses of the past two years, compounding on the already growing needs for our community.

1898
02:48:41,997 --> 02:48:48,440
If you truly mean to put our students first, please help us provide the education and environment they deserve today.

1899
02:48:49,253 --> 02:48:51,555
Thank you for hearing my colleagues and me tonight.

1900
02:48:51,915 --> 02:48:56,619
I hope you have listened and help us take action for the coming year.

1901
02:48:56,659 --> 02:49:02,445
Thank you.

1902
02:49:10,934 --> 02:49:13,494
Go ahead, name and address for the record, please.

1903
02:49:13,855 --> 02:49:15,155
My name is Maria Skiffington.

1904
02:49:15,335 --> 02:49:23,296
I've been a kindergarten teacher at the Roberts Elementary School for the past 16 years, and on my birthday in August, I will officially be a retired teacher.

1905
02:49:24,276 --> 02:49:29,357
I'm retiring from teaching about six years earlier than I had planned, and I wanna share why.

1906
02:49:30,477 --> 02:49:37,679
Before I do, I just want everyone here to know that I have truly enjoyed my time at the Roberts Elementary School, teaching alongside the best.

1907
02:49:40,116 --> 02:49:43,837
it's been an honor and a pleasure to be a part of that community.

1908
02:49:44,877 --> 02:49:51,879
As I stated in my retirement letter to the superintendent, teaching in Medford as it is today places huge demands on my daily life.

1909
02:49:52,519 --> 02:50:04,702
The recent proposal amidst contract negotiations to reduce prep time is a blow that indicates that these demands will continue to grow, leaving us with even less time than we already have for our family and for other fulfilling interests.

1910
02:50:06,321 --> 02:50:15,567
While working beyond contracted hours has been a growing problem since before the pandemic, the past three years has had teachers giving more than we thought we ever could.

1911
02:50:16,287 --> 02:50:20,050
Teachers turned on a dime in 2020 to get packets and materials ready for our students.

1912
02:50:20,590 --> 02:50:26,534
We worked with the children and their families remotely, learning as we went, trying to keep children engaged and learning to finish out 2020.

1913
02:50:26,714 --> 02:50:32,258
And we did all this while dealing with our own struggles with family illness, quarantine, and upended employment.

1914
02:50:33,577 --> 02:50:42,302
Whether you're a remote or a hybrid teacher, the 2020-2021 school year was the most intense, most challenging, and most exhausting year of our lives.

1915
02:50:43,122 --> 02:50:49,666
To facilitate this new way of teaching and learning without missing a beat, we collaborated on our plans and prepped after school and on weekends.

1916
02:50:50,386 --> 02:51:00,252
From delivering packets and materials to children's homes, troubleshooting technology, issues with family members, recording video instructions for the at-home cohort, we were nonstop.

1917
02:51:01,202 --> 02:51:03,946
We bought what was necessary to help these little ones.

1918
02:51:04,847 --> 02:51:06,429
I teach kindergarten, so they're five and six.

1919
02:51:07,250 --> 02:51:16,142
Navigate a desk, which they're not even supposed to have until first grade, keep supplies that they'd usually share separate, and show that they're work away from six feet away.

1920
02:51:16,162 --> 02:51:18,144
I'm sorry, excuse me, that's making me nervous.

1921
02:51:19,345 --> 02:51:31,413
Anyway, while our five and six-year-old children were kept at their shielded desks in the classroom, unable to share or allowed to play, distanced and isolated by necessity, we hope for your recovery in 2021-22.

1922
02:51:32,133 --> 02:51:34,095
Recovery is not what happened at all this year.

1923
02:51:35,215 --> 02:51:40,599
Still faced with the protocols of the pandemic, we are now expected to make our classrooms back to normal.

1924
02:51:42,500 --> 02:51:45,662
We are expected to do more while being told to practice self-care.

1925
02:51:46,082 --> 02:51:47,303
When are we going to do that?

1926
02:51:49,099 --> 02:51:54,623
It's questionable whether what we were asked to implement is even developmentally appropriate for kindergarten.

1927
02:51:55,223 --> 02:52:04,930
We learned and delivered a new phonics program that has children sitting in front of a projected screen of letters and words, performing repetitive decoding exercises for 20 to 25 minutes a day.

1928
02:52:05,791 --> 02:52:08,733
We administered online tests to children who could barely walk a mouse.

1929
02:52:09,647 --> 02:52:21,879
We worked within block schedules that meant giving up flexibility that's needed to review a difficult topic, provide support to that small group that gets pulled out, spend more time on something that grabs students' passions and interests.

1930
02:52:22,479 --> 02:52:26,743
And the one that gets me most of all is facilitating authentic play-based learning.

1931
02:52:27,564 --> 02:52:30,147
Everyone who knows me knows I'm passionate about Focus on K.

1932
02:52:31,702 --> 02:52:34,665
Focus on K was adopted by the district six years ago.

1933
02:52:34,865 --> 02:52:38,027
It is a plain inquiry based approach to teaching our youngest learners.

1934
02:52:38,588 --> 02:52:45,714
It incorporates all the standards of literacy, math, science, and social emotional learning into an authentic application of those concepts.

1935
02:52:46,314 --> 02:52:51,138
This past year, because of block scheduling, focus was watered down to being meaningless.

1936
02:52:52,279 --> 02:52:59,125
It's funny because one of the best things that focus delivers that central administration is supposedly so concerned about is social emotional learning.

1937
02:52:59,860 --> 02:53:07,283
With this approach, we don't just talk at our children about sharing, about the zones, about caring, about being kind.

1938
02:53:08,184 --> 02:53:16,708
With focus on, hey, children are encouraged to put those concepts into practice naturally, authentically, mindfully infusing their learning with their daily classroom life.

1939
02:53:17,508 --> 02:53:23,971
Here, the lack of time to teach children using developmentally appropriate practice was another huge factor in my decision to leave.

1940
02:53:25,092 --> 02:53:32,514
When I consider all the teachers and staff have been doing to get our community through this difficult and unprecedented time, I'm very proud to have been a part of it.

1941
02:53:33,495 --> 02:53:40,417
I have a difficult time understanding how we have gone through all we have without central administration respectfully acknowledging our hard work.

1942
02:53:41,368 --> 02:53:44,311
Showing respect is not just a line on a weekly update.

1943
02:53:44,691 --> 02:53:47,814
It's not a measly raise that doesn't even approach the cost of living.

1944
02:53:48,334 --> 02:53:49,695
It's not reduced prep time.

1945
02:53:50,096 --> 02:53:57,042
And it's certainly not referencing teachers as the ones who stand in front of the classroom, as we were in a recent budget presentation.

1946
02:53:57,482 --> 02:53:58,883
We are so much more.

1947
02:54:00,090 --> 02:54:04,312
The lack of respect is the reason for my decision to retire early.

1948
02:54:04,913 --> 02:54:07,895
Respecting teachers means really listening to teachers.

1949
02:54:08,335 --> 02:54:11,257
It means standing up and doing what is right for them and their students.

1950
02:54:11,917 --> 02:54:14,058
It means paying them a decent living wage.

1951
02:54:14,759 --> 02:54:17,780
Teachers work hard for the city of Medford in the best of times.

1952
02:54:18,221 --> 02:54:20,902
It's time for the city of Medford to give the teachers what they deserve.

1953
02:54:21,382 --> 02:54:24,965
And please, don't ask them to provide evidence that they're worthy.

1954
02:54:25,505 --> 02:54:28,667
The evidence is right there in front of you each and every day.

1955
02:54:29,436 --> 02:54:29,776
Thank you.

1956
02:54:29,936 --> 02:54:30,577
Thank you.

1957
02:54:43,845 --> 02:54:44,885
And just whatever, please.

1958
02:54:45,486 --> 02:54:47,247
Barry Ingber, 9 Draper Street.

1959
02:54:47,847 --> 02:54:52,790
And thank you, President Morrell and members of the council for this opportunity to speak.

1960
02:54:54,308 --> 02:55:09,221
I'm really wowed by these teachers and I'm actually changing what I'm going to talk about because I feel like there isn't anything that I can say that isn't trivial compared to what we've been hearing from them.

1961
02:55:09,802 --> 02:55:20,932
What I was planning to say was, it was something along the lines of, we need to raise the revenues to support our schools, to support our library,

1962
02:55:21,812 --> 02:55:27,216
and to support housing and to support all of the other services that we need and that are underfunded in this city.

1963
02:55:28,216 --> 02:55:31,158
And if you need to tax me to do that, tax me.

1964
02:55:33,079 --> 02:55:38,503
But I'm gonna address two things that you're not likely to hear from the audience.

1965
02:55:40,324 --> 02:55:49,530
One is, for a long time I've been hearing counselors talk about the need for having their own independent council.

1966
02:55:50,630 --> 02:55:57,792
And I thought that it was political grandstanding and I was wrong.

1967
02:55:59,532 --> 02:56:02,493
You guys do need independent counsel.

1968
02:56:03,733 --> 02:56:10,175
And I've experienced that as a resident activist working on ordinances where KP law has come in.

1969
02:56:10,755 --> 02:56:16,957
And instead of being helpful about how to craft a good ordinance has been obstructionist.

1970
02:56:17,832 --> 02:56:22,315
and has just gotten in the way of doing the work.

1971
02:56:22,695 --> 02:56:25,677
KP Law is not providing the services that you need.

1972
02:56:26,117 --> 02:56:30,580
You need a budget line so that you can have your own council to help you do your work.

1973
02:56:38,525 --> 02:56:44,549
Actually, I don't want to thank Councilor Knight for pushing on this issue over and over again.

1974
02:56:45,229 --> 02:56:46,290
I convinced you, huh?

1975
02:56:48,351 --> 02:56:53,555
convinced me, and there's times when I've convinced you of things, so back at you.

1976
02:56:56,117 --> 02:57:09,607
The other that I want to address is I recognize, and I think everybody else here recognizes how little power the city council has on the budget issue.

1977
02:57:11,988 --> 02:57:17,873
And the reason for this lack of power is our charter.

1978
02:57:19,025 --> 02:57:27,848
I ask you all to revisit the charter issue and to pass a charter review unanimously.

1979
02:57:29,689 --> 02:57:30,369
It will help you.

1980
02:57:31,209 --> 02:57:31,610
Thank you.

1981
02:57:31,810 --> 02:57:32,210
Thank you.

1982
02:57:39,052 --> 02:57:40,113
Name and address for the record, please.

1983
02:57:40,153 --> 02:57:43,434
Rebecca Johnson, 108 Floral Ave in Malden.

1984
02:57:44,114 --> 02:57:46,155
I brought my own timer because I'm a special ed teacher.

1985
02:57:51,345 --> 02:57:53,026
Good evening, members of the City Council.

1986
02:57:53,787 --> 02:57:59,491
I watched your meeting last Tuesday, and I'm here to tell you what years of funder funding has looked like for my students and me.

1987
02:58:00,192 --> 02:58:01,853
But first, let me tell you about my job.

1988
02:58:02,934 --> 02:58:06,757
I'm a special education teacher in the language-based program at the McGlynn Middle School.

1989
02:58:07,478 --> 02:58:13,642
This job is the best kept secret in Bedford, working with some of the best people, best young people in the city.

1990
02:58:14,524 --> 02:58:23,487
My students have a variety of disabilities which result in significant learning challenges, behavioral challenges, and other needs that make learning in a typical classroom difficult.

1991
02:58:24,228 --> 02:58:31,150
They work extremely hard and progress can be slow to arrive, but when they experience success, it's the coolest thing in the world to witness.

1992
02:58:31,750 --> 02:58:37,813
It's what keeps me coming back even when the challenges of pandemic schooling had me questioning my choice of career.

1993
02:58:38,913 --> 02:58:45,977
My students are the most vulnerable students that administrators insisted be brought back first when school reopened in 2020.

1994
02:58:46,717 --> 02:58:54,461
Administrators like to bring that up frequently as a point of pride, but when it comes to adequately staffing classrooms like mine, we hear crickets.

1995
02:58:55,142 --> 02:59:02,746
I heard you say last week that teachers are consistently asked to do more with less, and while for you that may be a talking point, it's my working reality.

1996
02:59:03,626 --> 02:59:11,073
When I was hired in 2014, the language-based program had three teachers, one for sixth grade, one for seventh grade, and me in eighth grade.

1997
02:59:11,654 --> 02:59:15,697
My second year, and every year since, we've been reduced to two teachers.

1998
02:59:16,298 --> 02:59:22,404
This means having multi-grade classes where some of our students attend lunch, art, music, P.E.

1999
02:59:22,444 --> 02:59:23,304
with a different grade.

2000
02:59:24,025 --> 02:59:27,546
One year we had a sixth grader attend an eighth grade health class.

2001
02:59:28,026 --> 02:59:35,449
Certainly not developmentally appropriate, but those situations will continue to occur when you're asked to do more with less.

2002
02:59:36,410 --> 02:59:39,471
This year we were short a paraprofessional for the last part of the school year.

2003
02:59:40,111 --> 02:59:43,432
We had a student move in with specific needs that no one could have predicted.

2004
02:59:44,012 --> 02:59:48,074
However, when your schools are kept at lean staffing levels, there's no one to call for help.

2005
02:59:49,074 --> 02:59:51,035
This is what the last few years have been like.

2006
02:59:52,051 --> 02:59:58,372
In my classroom and in classrooms district wide, paraprofessionals were consistently pulled from one assignment to cover another.

2007
02:59:59,032 --> 03:00:04,734
Robbing students in one class to serve the needs of students in another class puts everyone at a disadvantage.

2008
03:00:05,414 --> 03:00:13,675
Our students have very specific needs outlined in their IEPs and teachers found themselves constantly training staff that rotated in and out of their rooms.

2009
03:00:14,376 --> 03:00:20,697
Having to work with different people every day doesn't foster the type of student educator relationships that we should want for our kids.

2010
03:00:21,927 --> 03:00:29,570
In a conversation last week with a colleague, they said to me, those in charge will continue to understaff our schools because they know we'll make it work.

2011
03:00:30,250 --> 03:00:35,312
Educators always make it work because we have to and because the students in front of us deserve that.

2012
03:00:35,872 --> 03:00:43,515
However, doing more with less cannot possibly be the best practice for anyone and should not be the operating motto of the Medford Public Schools.

2013
03:00:44,035 --> 03:00:49,417
Thank you for your time and allowing me to share what years of underfunding has looked like for me and more importantly, our students.

2014
03:01:00,781 --> 03:01:02,422
Thank you, name and address for the record, please.

2015
03:01:02,642 --> 03:01:03,682
Yes, Audra Cashin.

2016
03:01:03,842 --> 03:01:08,064
I work at McGlynn Middle School, 3002 Mystic Valley Parkway.

2017
03:01:09,425 --> 03:01:23,311
Before I start, I was interested to hear that department heads have gone down in City Hall because I've been teaching in Medford for 24 years, and you should check out the school budget because the number of department heads has done nothing but rise the entire time I've been here.

2018
03:01:30,980 --> 03:01:34,424
I attended last week's budget meeting and wanted to begin by saying thank you.

2019
03:01:34,745 --> 03:01:38,409
I wanted to thank you for asking to hear from the teachers of Medford.

2020
03:01:38,669 --> 03:01:47,019
I have attended many meetings over the 24 years and last week's meeting here with you all was one of the few times I left feeling supported.

2021
03:01:47,760 --> 03:01:52,161
You repeatedly recognized the importance of funding education in Medford, but you didn't end there.

2022
03:01:52,422 --> 03:01:53,442
You asked to hear from us.

2023
03:01:53,762 --> 03:01:55,843
You asked for teachers to attend tonight's meeting.

2024
03:01:56,283 --> 03:01:59,364
I'm not sure you can understand what an impact that had on me.

2025
03:01:59,764 --> 03:02:02,945
When I arrived home and my husband asked how the meeting went, I replied, great.

2026
03:02:03,745 --> 03:02:06,046
His head shot up in disbelief and said, really?

2027
03:02:06,066 --> 03:02:08,167
He thought I was being sarcastic.

2028
03:02:09,207 --> 03:02:10,908
I realized nothing was settled last week.

2029
03:02:10,988 --> 03:02:13,628
The council made it clear you can only make recommendations.

2030
03:02:14,169 --> 03:02:16,089
So why did I find the meeting so encouraging?

2031
03:02:16,389 --> 03:02:17,590
Because I felt respected.

2032
03:02:18,370 --> 03:02:19,870
I knew you wanted to hear from us.

2033
03:02:20,330 --> 03:02:31,574
Lately, this hasn't been the case when it comes to central administration or school committee, which much of the time, Mr. Murphy's back has been turned to the teachers talking when he wasn't outside the room.

2034
03:02:33,113 --> 03:02:37,036
I received the emails from central administration saying how much we are appreciated.

2035
03:02:37,076 --> 03:02:42,160
At school committee, I hear the words read to the public time and time again, but they mean nothing to me.

2036
03:02:42,600 --> 03:02:46,243
They mean nothing to me and unfortunately mean nothing to many teachers in this district.

2037
03:02:46,603 --> 03:02:48,225
They are not followed up with actions.

2038
03:02:48,605 --> 03:02:50,867
The school committee is out of touch.

2039
03:02:52,047 --> 03:02:53,489
with what is happening in the classroom.

2040
03:02:53,789 --> 03:03:03,182
They're listening to central administration who reports out what they want school committee to hear, and oftentimes does not reflect what the days are truly like for the educators of Medford.

2041
03:03:04,633 --> 03:03:18,061
I work with many talented and dedicated educators, unfortunately they're either leaving Medford, or talking about leaving one of my colleagues who is fairly new to the system attended a recent school committee meeting with some of her family members, her family was disgusted.

2042
03:03:18,481 --> 03:03:20,882
They asked why do you want to stay in that system.

2043
03:03:21,303 --> 03:03:24,685
Why do you want to work for people who speak to you, and about you that way.

2044
03:03:25,285 --> 03:03:29,526
The answer she gave them, she wants to stay because she loves her students and she loves her colleagues.

2045
03:03:30,146 --> 03:03:32,726
Medford has amazing kids and amazing teachers.

2046
03:03:33,126 --> 03:03:38,047
The staff supports each other and they respect each other, but they need more than supportive colleagues.

2047
03:03:38,427 --> 03:03:42,888
They need to work in a community that invests in their kids by investing in their schools.

2048
03:03:43,688 --> 03:03:49,690
It's hard to work all day and many times well into the night and consistently be let down by the leaders of your school district.

2049
03:03:50,050 --> 03:03:51,470
Sadly, this is what's happening.

2050
03:03:52,230 --> 03:03:56,133
Thank you for last week and please continue to advocate for students.

2051
03:03:56,594 --> 03:04:00,817
Continue to ask tough questions and demand specific answers.

2052
03:04:01,538 --> 03:04:03,599
Continue to support Medford educators.

2053
03:04:03,960 --> 03:04:13,667
Continue to ask that funds designated for educators are in fact used to compensate and retain the excellent ones we have here in the city.

2054
03:04:14,128 --> 03:04:15,569
Help our community thrive.

2055
03:04:15,929 --> 03:04:18,752
To invest in educators is to invest in students.

2056
03:04:19,292 --> 03:04:19,632
Thank you.

2057
03:04:31,702 --> 03:04:32,943
Name and address for the record, please.

2058
03:04:33,804 --> 03:04:35,305
My name is Hendrick Gideons.

2059
03:04:35,506 --> 03:04:39,249
I live at 14 Rita Drive in the Heights.

2060
03:04:40,530 --> 03:04:43,874
I'm coming here to talk from a parent's perspective.

2061
03:04:46,036 --> 03:04:50,820
I have two children, seven and 11, at the Missittuck School, and

2062
03:04:54,002 --> 03:05:06,755
What the level of service that we've received from the school since the pandemic has been way way lower than what we need and.

2063
03:05:08,914 --> 03:05:15,181
The amount of money that we're talking about, the disparity, if it's $4 million, not enough.

2064
03:05:15,321 --> 03:05:24,071
And that amount of money is nowhere near close to what we need to put into the schools to do the job that needs to be done.

2065
03:05:25,012 --> 03:05:27,354
Our children are really struggling.

2066
03:05:28,283 --> 03:05:31,445
They're struggling with basic emotions.

2067
03:05:32,245 --> 03:05:34,586
My kids have enough to eat right now.

2068
03:05:34,626 --> 03:05:40,469
We have enough money and they're struggling and all of the kids are struggling.

2069
03:05:41,730 --> 03:05:47,193
The teachers need to be able to have enough support so that they can do their jobs.

2070
03:05:47,593 --> 03:05:53,796
And we probably need another 50% more money than that in order to do the job well.

2071
03:05:54,656 --> 03:05:57,538
So we need a bigger piece of pie.

2072
03:05:58,698 --> 03:06:01,499
to the school and the pie needs to be bigger.

2073
03:06:01,999 --> 03:06:09,262
There is no shortcut to getting services that we deserve without the pie being bigger.

2074
03:06:09,842 --> 03:06:18,366
The only way the pie is going to actually get bigger is to increase taxes and no one wants to pay more taxes.

2075
03:06:18,826 --> 03:06:24,048
It's true, but we are not getting what we need from the city.

2076
03:06:25,651 --> 03:06:33,297
In order to have a tax base improve in business, those businesses have to come here.

2077
03:06:33,898 --> 03:06:42,584
Businesses are not gonna come to a place that schools are suffering, that teachers are leaving, that teachers are being laid off.

2078
03:06:42,705 --> 03:06:46,207
That's not a good look for a company moving to Medford.

2079
03:06:47,008 --> 03:06:53,133
So we need to attract the best and the brightest and our talent pool is leaving.

2080
03:06:54,898 --> 03:07:10,290
On a different subject, I do not see eye to eye with the mayor on many things, but I absolutely respect her going after the corruption and incompetence that we have in our town.

2081
03:07:11,510 --> 03:07:12,791
It's bad.

2082
03:07:13,592 --> 03:07:19,677
And somebody needs to take a stand and get rid of the people that are pulling the city down.

2083
03:07:20,595 --> 03:07:30,543
And I don't think it's a lot of people, but there's definitely people that are not doing their jobs and are not serving the people of Medford well.

2084
03:07:31,424 --> 03:07:35,687
I wish she was able to communicate more about what she's doing.

2085
03:07:36,688 --> 03:07:41,511
And hopefully there'll be a, sorry,

2086
03:07:42,913 --> 03:07:52,744
a midpoint where she can explain what she's trying to do to the council and the council will be able to feel confident in allocating those funds.

2087
03:07:53,205 --> 03:07:57,690
But cleaning out the dirt in the town is going to cost money.

2088
03:07:58,331 --> 03:08:00,834
And that's just the way it is, I think.

2089
03:08:01,635 --> 03:08:01,915
Thank you.

2090
03:08:11,063 --> 03:08:12,284
Name and address for the record, please.

2091
03:08:13,604 --> 03:08:17,026
Rebecca Gutwin, 47 Morrison Street in Medford, Massachusetts.

2092
03:08:18,327 --> 03:08:31,133
Council members, it's absolutely jarring to come to the meeting tonight and hear a list of wonderful accomplishments that the mayor wants to present that we have done over the last three years.

2093
03:08:32,062 --> 03:08:47,911
and talk about things like trees and grants and outside money from the city that we've been able to bring in and then sit here and listen to the teachers and the systemic problems that they're facing that we are just never going to be able to address with outside money.

2094
03:08:48,432 --> 03:08:58,798
And we're just never going to be able to fully fund if we're only looking to take $40,000 of free cash in order to keep the library open.

2095
03:08:59,800 --> 03:09:02,107
We just are never going to make significant amount of progress.

2096
03:09:02,448 --> 03:09:03,792
And I think that the mayor is

2097
03:09:04,967 --> 03:09:28,786
is mistaken if she thinks that taxpayers aren't ready to consider a prop two and a half override to actually fully fund what the city needs to make full progress on the places that we want to go so that we're not worried about negotiating with marijuana dispensaries, but we're actually investing in the community that we live in, that we're taking ownership

2098
03:09:29,567 --> 03:09:31,088
of the progress that we're making.

2099
03:09:31,168 --> 03:09:51,719
And so I would ask that the council and that the mayor would consider this as an immediate move to really change the trajectory of Medford so that we're not always just putting band-aids over the problems, but we're really able to step up and fund the actual things that are running our city, the future of our city, and make a bigger difference.

2100
03:09:52,880 --> 03:09:53,180
Thank you.

2101
03:10:01,543 --> 03:10:02,643
New address for the record, please.

2102
03:10:02,683 --> 03:10:04,764
Hi, Shanine Peliquin, 108 Belaf.

2103
03:10:05,304 --> 03:10:06,085
It's been a while.

2104
03:10:06,105 --> 03:10:17,529
I've been in front of this body many times in the past and in different hats, but today I speak to you as a play advocate, a developmental specialist, recreation therapist, and newly a playground safety inspector.

2105
03:10:18,269 --> 03:10:21,531
I'm also the co-chair of the McGlynn Playground Committee as a volunteer.

2106
03:10:23,153 --> 03:10:33,075
There are so many wonderful parks projects happening in a particular recreation Kevin in the recreation department has been working to increase accessibility in the facilities he manages.

2107
03:10:34,135 --> 03:10:46,778
But that said, we are spending millions of dollars on comprehensive park renovations, finally taking account robust meaningful community input processes that include youth and people with disabilities we're doing it well.

2108
03:10:48,418 --> 03:10:51,060
We're using park funds and CDBG and CPC funds.

2109
03:10:51,100 --> 03:10:52,521
Thank God we passed the CPA.

2110
03:10:53,601 --> 03:10:59,264
None of this would be happening, among other funding, and yet we don't maintain any of it appropriately once it's built.

2111
03:11:00,505 --> 03:11:05,687
The playground safety inspector who completed the McGlynn inspection over the winter compared it to buying a brand new car.

2112
03:11:06,928 --> 03:11:08,829
Oh, after saying the thing needed to be bulldozed.

2113
03:11:10,270 --> 03:11:16,072
Not taking it for oil changes, rotating tires, or even topping off fluids, and then expecting everything to be fine and last for 20 years.

2114
03:11:17,653 --> 03:11:27,157
Both the DPW and the school custodians are severely under-resourced and under-prepared to take care of the playgrounds we have, much less afford replacement parts like broken slides and missing steering wheels.

2115
03:11:27,677 --> 03:11:29,638
There is no plan for ongoing inspection.

2116
03:11:31,217 --> 03:11:42,341
We talk so often about valuing our parks, but it is clear from decades of underfunding, which I understand that the current mayor and this body are trying to clean up, that the care of these parks, that this is not the case.

2117
03:11:42,361 --> 03:11:45,422
We don't actually value them unless they're just not shiny and new.

2118
03:11:45,442 --> 03:11:56,846
I urge you to explore all options, including a prop two and a half override to make our city services sustainable and our children's play spaces not only new and shiny during election season, but safe and desirable places to play throughout their lifespan.

2119
03:11:57,026 --> 03:11:57,327
Thank you.

2120
03:11:57,727 --> 03:11:58,007
Thank you.

2121
03:12:06,854 --> 03:12:07,874
Name and address for the record, please.

2122
03:12:08,434 --> 03:12:09,835
Hi, my name is Sam Sednick.

2123
03:12:10,095 --> 03:12:13,456
My address is 47 West Wyoming Avenue in Melrose.

2124
03:12:14,036 --> 03:12:15,576
And I am one of your librarians.

2125
03:12:16,077 --> 03:12:21,318
And I do appreciate that you found money to fund positions that are unfilled at the library.

2126
03:12:21,938 --> 03:12:27,880
But this room was full today of staff members from the city who are not getting paid enough.

2127
03:12:28,747 --> 03:12:35,231
who are doing more jobs than they have to, trying to make ends meet in the city.

2128
03:12:36,112 --> 03:12:38,774
Our library has a staff of 27.

2129
03:12:39,875 --> 03:12:44,398
Our neighboring town, Winchester, serves half the population that we serve.

2130
03:12:45,138 --> 03:12:47,039
They have double the staff that we have.

2131
03:12:48,400 --> 03:12:55,145
I'm trying to hire positions in the children's room right now, and we're paying $4 an hour less than Winchester is offering.

2132
03:12:55,848 --> 03:13:05,630
We cannot recruit competent employees, retain competent employees, unless we start to pay them for what they're worth and for the jobs that they're doing.

2133
03:13:06,370 --> 03:13:22,354
Now, I am speaking about the library because that's what I know, but you just heard from a million teachers who are doing wonderful, hard, ridiculous work, and you're not going to retain them if you can't find a way to pay them for what they're doing.

2134
03:13:23,094 --> 03:13:25,395
So I know this budget is rough this year,

2135
03:13:26,235 --> 03:13:33,100
But every time a budget comes up, we are asked to tighten our belt, to do just a little bit more, to try to make it to the other end.

2136
03:13:33,240 --> 03:13:39,985
And ultimately, we hear in this budget, the reason this budget is hard is because there's cost escalation, there's inflation.

2137
03:13:40,586 --> 03:13:47,771
Inflation's at 8.6%, and we're supposed to applaud a 2.5% raise to the school budget.

2138
03:13:49,072 --> 03:13:51,454
That additional money, though, means that

2139
03:13:52,579 --> 03:13:54,099
the staff is getting paid less.

2140
03:13:54,519 --> 03:14:05,042
We're the ones that are pinching pennies, that are having less time with our families, that are struggling to pay for gas or rent.

2141
03:14:05,822 --> 03:14:11,743
And that's because we're not getting paid what we need in order to do our jobs.

2142
03:14:12,403 --> 03:14:21,445
So help us keep wonderful employees in the schools and in the libraries and at the DPW, but you have to pay for it or we can have to cut services.

2143
03:14:22,495 --> 03:14:22,855
Thank you.

2144
03:14:30,346 --> 03:14:32,388
Just one moment.

2145
03:14:33,810 --> 03:14:34,952
Just your mic went out, Shane.

2146
03:14:41,351 --> 03:14:42,171
Good talking person.

2147
03:14:42,191 --> 03:14:44,292
There you go.

2148
03:14:44,952 --> 03:14:46,032
Just name and address for the record, please.

2149
03:14:46,052 --> 03:14:47,432
Yep, just name and address for the record, please.

2150
03:14:47,732 --> 03:14:52,694
Stephen South, Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Local 25, 106 Damon Road.

2151
03:14:53,274 --> 03:15:04,116
Just wanted to clarify when we're talking about cuts in the schools, that there's been significant cuts to the security staff and budget over the years, including this year.

2152
03:15:04,516 --> 03:15:10,558
And I wanted to clarify what someone from central administration said tonight and make a few other points.

2153
03:15:12,339 --> 03:15:20,586
We had about 10 security guards many years ago, and through layoffs and attrition, we were down to one as of this school year.

2154
03:15:21,246 --> 03:15:30,695
At the end of March of 2022, security guard Bill Mazzacca retired after 47 years, and I congratulate him.

2155
03:15:31,135 --> 03:15:37,440
But the city immediately notified us that they would not be replacing that position

2156
03:15:38,461 --> 03:15:46,103
And I want to make it clear that there would no longer be security guards at Medford public schools, that's one point.

2157
03:15:47,223 --> 03:16:00,366
Number two is the school resource officer there was no school resource officer for about a year and a half at Medford High School, and that was just returned several months ago, I just want to make that clear so we didn't have that person.

2158
03:16:01,546 --> 03:16:09,314
At the back of the school do door 31 is where the pool and the basketball courts are located.

2159
03:16:09,694 --> 03:16:16,661
And for many many years we had security staff back there that would check everyone in so every parent spectator.

2160
03:16:17,582 --> 03:16:23,607
people from other towns that would show up for games, everyone would would give their ID and be checked in and sign in.

2161
03:16:24,187 --> 03:16:36,317
Well as of this year the city eliminated that so the procedure is and I and I double checked with my custodial staff today, as up until the last day of school this year, so just recently.

2162
03:16:37,117 --> 03:16:47,944
The procedure is at 220 every day, the custodian unlocks the back door and that door is open all day up until the last event at nine or 10 o'clock at night.

2163
03:16:48,024 --> 03:16:52,828
So anyone can walk in or out of the high school at any time after school.

2164
03:16:52,868 --> 03:16:56,350
That's been going on for this entire school year.

2165
03:16:57,091 --> 03:16:58,852
Okay, that's another point I wanted to make.

2166
03:16:58,912 --> 03:17:00,173
So that budget was cut.

2167
03:17:00,953 --> 03:17:13,708
And we used to have someone at door 31 from right after school until the very last event every single day Monday to Friday, and we had someone there from morning tonight on Saturday and Sunday.

2168
03:17:14,795 --> 03:17:28,022
My fourth point is over the winter, we asked central administration for a meeting with myself and my stewards from the custodial and security staff to discuss open and important security issues.

2169
03:17:28,523 --> 03:17:34,506
We gave them about 10 bullet points and central administration said, we'll get back to you within a week or two.

2170
03:17:34,786 --> 03:17:39,169
Well, we're still waiting for an answer on all of those bullet points many months later.

2171
03:17:39,769 --> 03:17:40,830
And my last point is,

2172
03:17:41,450 --> 03:17:52,618
In our contracts, it specifies that our members will get security training every single year, as well as new hires to get certain security trainings.

2173
03:17:53,158 --> 03:17:56,280
That has never happened, and that was one of the bullet points.

2174
03:17:56,361 --> 03:18:06,868
So we have a lot of issues, we have a lot of budget shortfalls in the different departments, but I do wanna point out, and I really value and appreciate

2175
03:18:07,268 --> 03:18:09,991
all the teachers and administrators and support staff.

2176
03:18:10,331 --> 03:18:18,339
But I just wanted to point out how important security is in the schools and that it is being cut and that it is in the public.

2177
03:18:18,459 --> 03:18:22,243
And I don't believe yourselves know that all this is going on.

2178
03:18:22,343 --> 03:18:26,867
So I know that all the champions of transparency were here tonight.

2179
03:18:26,947 --> 03:18:30,671
So on that theme, I want to make sure that we're all being transparent

2180
03:18:30,951 --> 03:18:38,615
and that all of you in this room know everything that's going on within the schools with all the children and the teachers and staff.

2181
03:18:38,655 --> 03:18:39,775
Thank you again for your time.

2182
03:18:39,995 --> 03:18:40,315
Thank you.

2183
03:18:40,335 --> 03:18:48,359
I'm just going to keep it to folks speaking once on the paper beforehand.

2184
03:18:48,399 --> 03:18:49,900
We have some folks on Zoom who want to speak.

2185
03:18:50,320 --> 03:18:50,540
I do.

2186
03:18:50,740 --> 03:18:55,822
Mr. Murphy, if you want to, if there's anyone else in person who would like to speak before we move to Zoom.

2187
03:18:57,423 --> 03:18:59,004
Mr. Murphy, I know you wanted to speak.

2188
03:19:04,834 --> 03:19:06,016
Thank you, President Morrell.

2189
03:19:07,138 --> 03:19:15,232
There are a few different points that have been referenced on this topic that I think it would be beneficial for us to

2190
03:19:18,054 --> 03:19:19,355
offer some comments on.

2191
03:19:21,115 --> 03:19:36,522
I regret that for the third time in the course of a week, I need to turn my attention first to a general description of our security protocols procedures within the Metro public schools.

2192
03:19:38,043 --> 03:19:47,921
to getting to a level of specificity that the last speaker did, I think is reckless and I think is irresponsible.

2193
03:19:48,938 --> 03:20:00,205
I'm not speaking to Mr. South's intentions, frankly, because it is the case that for all of our bargaining partners, we try to have a constructive ongoing dialogue with.

2194
03:20:00,845 --> 03:20:14,153
And as I have said last week at your budget hearing, and I said earlier this evening, Mr. Mazeku's retirement did result in a change in the staffing configuration.

2195
03:20:16,534 --> 03:20:21,316
It is not the case that we are reducing our security presence.

2196
03:20:22,417 --> 03:20:27,760
We have, over the course of the last year, invested in more security personnel.

2197
03:20:28,420 --> 03:20:40,167
There have been some modifications with respect to some of the logistics, and there is some ongoing investment that needs to be made with respect to infrastructure.

2198
03:20:41,507 --> 03:20:58,994
beyond saying, as I have now on multiple occasions over the course of the last week, that there is nothing that the school administration, and I frankly think every staff member in the Medford Public Schools, takes more seriously than the safety and security of our students, of our staff, and of our visitors and families.

2199
03:21:00,215 --> 03:21:01,495
I don't have much more to say on that.

2200
03:21:02,436 --> 03:21:07,138
But this ongoing attempt to discuss the specifics

2201
03:21:07,758 --> 03:21:24,203
which I think is frankly like exploiting the very understandable anxiety that many of us in society feel because of situations that have unfolded in recent years, I think is irresponsible and I would ask respectfully that it not continue.

2202
03:21:25,043 --> 03:21:36,553
With regard to some of the staffing specifics, frankly, we've met several times and I was genuinely under the impression that we've responded to each of the questions that have been raised by the union.

2203
03:21:36,573 --> 03:21:41,036
But if there are additional questions, I'll be happy to continue to work with Mr. South on there.

2204
03:21:41,056 --> 03:21:47,602
I mentioned earlier that there's one staff position that we have to figure out exactly what its classification title and responsibilities are.

2205
03:21:48,242 --> 03:21:53,967
It's an incredibly dedicated staff member, something I think that Mr. South and I can agree on.

2206
03:21:54,447 --> 03:21:56,348
and someone that the district is lucky to have.

2207
03:21:57,169 --> 03:22:03,313
But I think from the community's perspective, what people need to know is that safety and security is our first priority.

2208
03:22:03,933 --> 03:22:13,500
That's been the case, and it's going to continue to be the case for as long as Dr. Edward, Vincent, myself, and other members of the leadership team are responsible for this organization.

2209
03:22:14,820 --> 03:22:18,082
That is my response to that specific issue.

2210
03:22:18,743 --> 03:22:30,874
And I know, I think myself, Mr. Dickinson, and I think the Chief of Staff, would like to speak to some of the other broader issues.

2211
03:22:31,034 --> 03:22:35,498
And frankly, Madam President, I don't know if now would be the appropriate time to do that.

2212
03:22:36,138 --> 03:22:36,398
I do.

2213
03:22:37,038 --> 03:22:38,619
Yeah, we have one more person here.

2214
03:22:38,639 --> 03:22:40,039
Why don't we get out of the way?

2215
03:22:40,060 --> 03:22:41,480
And then yeah, there was some folks on zoom.

2216
03:22:41,500 --> 03:22:43,301
I do just want to remind folks not that's happened.

2217
03:22:43,321 --> 03:22:45,942
But just when people speak, just try to not to.

2218
03:22:46,682 --> 03:22:49,803
The goal is to have follow up participation not to engage in debates back and forth.

2219
03:22:49,863 --> 03:22:52,724
Isn't anyone prefer that to be the case?

2220
03:22:52,744 --> 03:22:52,924
Yeah.

2221
03:22:53,124 --> 03:22:55,145
So just is it okay if we come back up?

2222
03:22:55,285 --> 03:22:55,665
Absolutely.

2223
03:22:55,685 --> 03:22:55,845
Great.

2224
03:22:55,885 --> 03:22:56,366
Thank you very much.

2225
03:22:56,386 --> 03:22:56,906
Appreciate it.

2226
03:22:58,186 --> 03:22:59,347
Name and address for the record, please.

2227
03:23:00,087 --> 03:23:02,608
Yes, Jessica Morgan, 10 Florence Street, Bedford.

2228
03:23:05,404 --> 03:23:06,265
I'm a software engineer.

2229
03:23:06,285 --> 03:23:10,948
I have a background in technology security.

2230
03:23:10,968 --> 03:23:15,892
I just want to say security through obscurity does not work.

2231
03:23:17,773 --> 03:23:33,065
The only way, the primary way, the gold standard on how we fix security problems is through public disclosure because in doing so we put pressure on the people who are responsible

2232
03:23:33,982 --> 03:23:36,104
and we force change.

2233
03:23:39,266 --> 03:23:51,234
So I'm just saying that faulting someone for publicly telling about some of the issues at school security is a problem.

2234
03:23:52,194 --> 03:24:00,220
And I also want to just re-highlight the issue that was spoken about by someone else about security cameras

2235
03:24:00,873 --> 03:24:07,516
at multiple entrances not working because that seems to have just kind of gone silent.

2236
03:24:07,896 --> 03:24:09,137
So that's all.

2237
03:24:09,637 --> 03:24:16,920
Thank you.

2238
03:24:17,060 --> 03:24:20,001
Also, did the AC, did the HVAC stop?

2239
03:24:20,061 --> 03:24:21,902
It's very quiet and it's getting warm.

2240
03:24:25,074 --> 03:24:25,254
Okay.

2241
03:24:25,714 --> 03:24:26,494
Going to Zoom.

2242
03:24:26,614 --> 03:24:28,835
Anna, name and address for the record, please.

2243
03:24:28,875 --> 03:24:30,616
I'm sorry, Anna, your last name, I'm sorry.

2244
03:24:32,577 --> 03:24:33,437
And then I'm gonna unmute you.

2245
03:24:34,177 --> 03:24:37,139
Here we go.

2246
03:24:37,479 --> 03:24:41,141
Anna Novogrodski, 20 Pleasant Street, Medford.

2247
03:24:42,601 --> 03:24:48,043
So I wanted to fact check some of the things that the mayor said.

2248
03:24:49,104 --> 03:24:49,764
First of all, so...

2249
03:24:54,207 --> 03:24:54,427
Thank you.

2250
03:24:54,467 --> 03:24:56,811
Mayor I'm not sure if the mayor is still present.

2251
03:24:57,191 --> 03:24:59,154
Um but Maryland go current.

2252
03:24:59,314 --> 03:25:03,901
You said that, um, you were able to provide the necessary

2253
03:25:09,468 --> 03:25:29,037
really shocked that you could say that out loud to our community, particularly after the elementary school teacher who spoke on behalf of Medford's elementary school teacher had already spoken at length about how the necessary school services are not being provided in our community to either the students or the teachers.

2254
03:25:32,016 --> 03:25:42,420
I know that a kindergarten teacher, my friend's kid's kindergarten teacher at the Brooks School, Mr. Giddings, who was incredible, he was pink slipped this year.

2255
03:25:42,900 --> 03:25:45,241
His job, he was not given a job for next year.

2256
03:25:45,261 --> 03:25:48,102
We're losing incredible teachers like that.

2257
03:25:50,483 --> 03:25:57,669
it's rare enough to have a male kindergarten teacher, and it's totally awesome, and we should retain all of them that are good that we can.

2258
03:25:59,411 --> 03:26:06,317
I want to highlight that the mayor said that the school committee overwhelmingly supported the budget she gave them.

2259
03:26:06,757 --> 03:26:18,107
For those listening who may not be aware, the school committee does not have the power to add items to the line budget, and so, of course, they passed the budget that she gave them.

2260
03:26:19,007 --> 03:26:22,090
because if they rejected it, the school would have no budget.

2261
03:26:23,971 --> 03:26:36,201
And I want to also state for the record that the mayor said that she had received very few comments from Medford residents who want to increase the budget.

2262
03:26:36,682 --> 03:26:39,804
I'm a Medford resident who wants her to increase the budget.

2263
03:26:40,245 --> 03:26:46,590
I'm currently on a text group with 26 other Medford residents who all want to increase the budget.

2264
03:26:48,488 --> 03:26:51,210
that's just a small sampling of people I happen to personally know.

2265
03:26:52,731 --> 03:27:06,638
So I also want to say that the mayor, you said you were acting on behalf of, that in this budget, by being austere in this budget, you were acting on behalf of Medford residents who can't afford food.

2266
03:27:07,058 --> 03:27:10,320
And I want to be clear that many of those residents are children.

2267
03:27:10,780 --> 03:27:14,922
They are students in our schools and teenagers in our schools, and they need our schools to be

2268
03:27:16,686 --> 03:27:26,594
they need teachers, they need support staff, they need paraprofessionals, they need food, and if you are truly acting on their behalf, you need to increase the budget.

2269
03:27:27,615 --> 03:27:32,999
I also just want to add, please continue not funding school resource officers.

2270
03:27:33,079 --> 03:27:34,721
Police do not belong in our schools.

2271
03:27:34,901 --> 03:27:41,486
They are unsafe for black and brown students, and also for neurodivergent students.

2272
03:27:41,686 --> 03:27:41,967
Thank you.

2273
03:27:44,827 --> 03:27:49,549
I'm going to breeze phone name and address for the record, please.

2274
03:27:49,589 --> 03:27:57,192
And also I'm just keep comments if you could to three minutes and I will just hold up the finger when you have one minute left, you could search for me on the zoom screen.

2275
03:27:57,572 --> 03:27:59,813
So breeze phone, just name and address for the record, please.

2276
03:28:04,635 --> 03:28:05,975
Oops, try again.

2277
03:28:05,995 --> 03:28:11,918
You do have your hand up perhaps.

2278
03:28:13,578 --> 03:28:14,939
Hi, can everyone hear me now?

2279
03:28:15,540 --> 03:28:16,180
Yes, we can hear you.

2280
03:28:16,220 --> 03:28:18,522
Name and address for the record, please.

2281
03:28:18,562 --> 03:28:19,383
Great, thank you.

2282
03:28:19,943 --> 03:28:20,764
My name is Bree Brothers.

2283
03:28:21,084 --> 03:28:22,905
I'm at 31 Gleason Street, Medford.

2284
03:28:24,026 --> 03:28:26,788
Thank you so much for allowing us to speak tonight.

2285
03:28:27,289 --> 03:28:37,296
I just wanted to say, I am someone that believes that public schools and public education is the foundation of democracy.

2286
03:28:38,922 --> 03:28:40,524
I'm also a parent of two young kids.

2287
03:28:40,924 --> 03:28:43,266
My oldest starts kindergarten in September.

2288
03:28:43,286 --> 03:28:48,850
And I want to feel good about sending my kids to school in Medford.

2289
03:28:48,870 --> 03:28:50,772
And right now, it's tough.

2290
03:28:51,232 --> 03:28:54,775
And I want to pay more.

2291
03:28:56,036 --> 03:28:57,117
I'm just going to say it.

2292
03:28:57,637 --> 03:29:00,740
I want to invest in schools within my community.

2293
03:29:01,080 --> 03:29:01,600
I'm here.

2294
03:29:01,620 --> 03:29:02,701
I want to.

2295
03:29:04,257 --> 03:29:05,938
I want to invest in my community.

2296
03:29:06,859 --> 03:29:14,044
And I mean, take my money, so that I never have to hear the heartbreaking stories from all those teachers that we just heard.

2297
03:29:14,825 --> 03:29:24,512
And you know I understand that not everyone can pay more, and everyone keeps City Council keep saying that there are safeguards that we can put in place to protect those people.

2298
03:29:26,043 --> 03:29:29,286
tell people what those are, and then let us vote.

2299
03:29:29,646 --> 03:29:33,229
And the mayor said, you know, I don't wanna do the prop two and a half thing.

2300
03:29:33,250 --> 03:29:35,031
I don't wanna make that decision in a vacuum.

2301
03:29:35,431 --> 03:29:37,273
Literally no one is asking you to do that.

2302
03:29:38,174 --> 03:29:40,796
Put it on the ballot, let people vote on it.

2303
03:29:41,737 --> 03:29:47,262
And also like, yes, new revenue is great, but as other members of the council said, we're not gonna see that for years.

2304
03:29:48,263 --> 03:29:52,307
Why would we just, it doesn't have to be one or the other.

2305
03:29:53,360 --> 03:29:59,823
I don't know why we would choose to suffer for four or five more years while we wait for this new revenue.

2306
03:30:01,824 --> 03:30:20,032
And it's just, with everything that we have asked of our teachers, even before, but especially during the last two years, I mean, let's not kid ourselves that we treated our teachers well before COVID anywhere in the entire country, really, but just,

2307
03:30:21,798 --> 03:30:25,080
please compensate our teachers, please fund our public schools.

2308
03:30:25,801 --> 03:30:28,543
They are educating the future of Medford.

2309
03:30:29,404 --> 03:30:38,690
And my last point I will say is that it's been really nice to see the council united on an issue like this.

2310
03:30:40,572 --> 03:30:45,075
And I will say that if we want to do something about it, don't vote against charter review.

2311
03:30:46,356 --> 03:30:46,616
Thank you.

2312
03:30:53,500 --> 03:30:56,502
Thank you, Matt Barlow, name and address for the record, please.

2313
03:30:59,244 --> 03:31:02,606
Hi, Matt Barlow, 36 Saunders Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

2314
03:31:03,947 --> 03:31:16,595
I just wanted to say as a taxpayer and a voter in Medford that I feel very strongly that the current funding for our schools and our educators is absolutely unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable.

2315
03:31:17,513 --> 03:31:21,119
And I am strongly in favor of increasing taxes.

2316
03:31:22,080 --> 03:31:30,352
People almost always say that they don't like paying taxes, but the part of my taxes that go to paying teachers and supporting schools, I am absolutely happy to pay.

2317
03:31:32,098 --> 03:31:36,641
We cannot thrive as a community without strongly supporting our schools.

2318
03:31:36,681 --> 03:31:45,566
We cannot grow as a community without supporting our schools, our educators, our libraries, and I strongly feel and support raising taxes.

2319
03:31:46,007 --> 03:31:53,232
We need to do it carefully so that it doesn't disproportionately impact those who can't afford to pay those increases, but there are lots of ways to do it.

2320
03:31:53,292 --> 03:31:56,374
People have thought carefully about how to do that, and I think we can do that.

2321
03:31:57,414 --> 03:32:08,677
So I'm strongly in favor of increasing the budget for schools, educators, and the libraries, and I'm happy to pay increased taxes on that.

2322
03:32:09,637 --> 03:32:21,660
I also feel that this budget process is unacceptable, and I support opening the charter to revise the way that we consider our budget as a town.

2323
03:32:22,680 --> 03:32:23,260
Thank you very much.

2324
03:32:27,612 --> 03:32:27,992
Thank you.

2325
03:32:30,774 --> 03:32:32,396
Jessica, name and address for the record, please.

2326
03:32:34,097 --> 03:32:36,359
Jessica Healy, Bullock Road.

2327
03:32:36,799 --> 03:32:38,300
Sorry, my camera is not working.

2328
03:32:39,881 --> 03:32:48,247
I'm the one that has asked before about security, and Mr. Murphy has responded, saying that they can't really release much information regarding it.

2329
03:32:49,108 --> 03:32:51,009
I'm just not too sure of why he,

2330
03:32:54,138 --> 03:33:07,064
Him including in the school is so quiet about releasing anything regarding Just the number of security guards that we have Um, and if it's true if we have none, that's a problem.

2331
03:33:07,864 --> 03:33:13,807
Um, you know if our cameras do work If our doors do lock I want to know what's the big?

2332
03:33:14,707 --> 03:33:22,751
Secret about letting us know those simple Answers i'm not asking for their entire security

2333
03:33:23,837 --> 03:33:24,018
Um.

2334
03:33:25,120 --> 03:33:29,026
Protocols everything that they're doing, but just the simple things.

2335
03:33:29,828 --> 03:33:32,031
I don't think that's giving away information.

2336
03:33:33,334 --> 03:33:36,279
Um, also on raising taxes.

2337
03:33:37,470 --> 03:33:39,051
I know we need to fund our teachers.

2338
03:33:39,392 --> 03:33:41,073
I'm 100% agreeable with that.

2339
03:33:41,914 --> 03:33:54,544
But for people that have been here 50 years that didn't buy a million dollar home here that can't afford to pay that much more in taxes, I really think we need to figure that out.

2340
03:33:56,488 --> 03:33:58,489
how to make it equitable.

2341
03:33:59,210 --> 03:34:05,074
And also resource officers in our school, that is something we definitely need with security officers.

2342
03:34:05,894 --> 03:34:16,661
I don't see police officers, resource officers going in school, doing anything to brown or black people other than protecting them.

2343
03:34:17,142 --> 03:34:17,582
Thank you.

2344
03:34:19,563 --> 03:34:19,924
Thank you.

2345
03:34:20,064 --> 03:34:21,845
Christina, name and address for the record, please.

2346
03:34:29,430 --> 03:34:30,051
Uh, one second.

2347
03:34:32,652 --> 03:34:34,753
Hi, I'm Christina McCordy.

2348
03:34:35,033 --> 03:34:36,874
I'm 24 North Street.

2349
03:34:38,075 --> 03:34:45,619
I just wanted to quickly come on just to go on record just to say that I am in full support of a prop two and a half override.

2350
03:34:46,399 --> 03:34:55,104
And I just fully urge the mayor to give us, to give us the residents of Medford the opportunity to vote on it.

2351
03:34:55,784 --> 03:34:57,145
And so I hope she does bring it

2352
03:34:58,386 --> 03:34:59,186
to the process.

2353
03:35:00,367 --> 03:35:14,239
The underfunding in Medford goes beyond, you know, this year and especially for me, I see it most in the schools just because I have two children in the schools for the past.

2354
03:35:15,460 --> 03:35:17,141
six years in the Met for Public Schools.

2355
03:35:18,282 --> 03:35:24,947
And so, you know, these cuts that are happening now are almost like, how do you take a bad situation and make it worse?

2356
03:35:24,967 --> 03:35:28,749
Like, there have been lots of things that we need funding for.

2357
03:35:29,150 --> 03:35:37,776
We haven't had math coaches in years, which leaves, you know, the teachers lacking in support, especially when, you know, a lot of the teachers are talking about kids coming back.

2358
03:35:38,476 --> 03:35:47,082
after the pandemic and you know math coaches are invaluable to helping the teachers differentiate instruction and understand where the kids are at.

2359
03:35:47,942 --> 03:35:55,928
We haven't had you know librarians like we have you know one librarian serving like three elementary schools the kids do not get to

2360
03:35:56,788 --> 03:36:01,471
Um, you know, some of the library aides are nice and great, but they're not librarians.

2361
03:36:01,531 --> 03:36:08,135
So, um, there's just ongoing like problems because of the underfunding the school adjustment counselors.

2362
03:36:08,555 --> 03:36:15,639
We don't have enough to both see kids who have scheduled time with them and then deal with emergencies.

2363
03:36:16,540 --> 03:36:16,620
Um,

2364
03:36:17,440 --> 03:36:30,968
And, you know, the fact that Medford can't afford to duplicate services where we like send kids to different programs, different schools, and, you know, with the whole middle school thing, with the lottery, like we just, we need more funds.

2365
03:36:31,068 --> 03:36:35,811
So I fully support a proposition to enough override.

2366
03:36:36,472 --> 03:36:39,674
And since I'm here, I'll also say fully support charter review.

2367
03:36:39,934 --> 03:36:40,294
Thank you.

2368
03:36:40,314 --> 03:36:41,555
Thank you.

2369
03:36:45,037 --> 03:37:04,945
If you folks would like to speak on Zoom, if everyone could just keep their comments brief, I know it's almost 11 o'clock, people wanna, you know, I know councilors still have questions, they have things, I don't know if there's motions, just so people can find out what happens with this budget before it's, you know, June 29th, if we could please keep comments brief.

2370
03:37:08,046 --> 03:37:09,607
Melanie, name and address for the record, please.

2371
03:37:14,169 --> 03:37:18,377
Hi, this is Melanie from 116 Forest Street in Medford.

2372
03:37:19,599 --> 03:37:22,684
I just wanted to go on the record and say that I appreciate

2373
03:37:23,815 --> 03:37:23,995
Thank you.

2374
03:37:24,035 --> 03:37:26,216
Um the mayor trying to make this budget work.

2375
03:37:26,876 --> 03:37:27,056
Um.

2376
03:37:27,917 --> 03:37:34,119
I'm sure it has not been an easy year given the situation with Covid and the reduction in revenue.

2377
03:37:34,139 --> 03:37:39,381
I do hope that the mayor and the City Council can work together and making this.

2378
03:37:40,542 --> 03:37:42,162
Um budget work.

2379
03:37:42,863 --> 03:37:44,243
I definitely feel for the

2380
03:37:52,365 --> 03:37:57,409
And I'm not for a proposition two and a half override.

2381
03:37:58,030 --> 03:38:02,714
We are all, all families are struggling right now to make ends meet.

2382
03:38:02,994 --> 03:38:11,361
Many people are working two jobs to make ends meet and many people are going and trying to do more with a lot less.

2383
03:38:13,122 --> 03:38:13,802
It's just a time.

2384
03:38:13,822 --> 03:38:17,003
It's just a situation that we're all currently in.

2385
03:38:17,103 --> 03:38:27,086
So I do appreciate the mayor trying to look for additional funding and making additional changes to try to appease everyone and I hope that the mayor and the city council can work on this.

2386
03:38:27,426 --> 03:38:27,747
Thank you.

2387
03:38:27,767 --> 03:38:29,327
Thank you.

2388
03:38:33,427 --> 03:38:34,067
Hi, thank you.

2389
03:38:34,347 --> 03:38:36,008
I'm Eunice Brown Greenleaf Ave.

2390
03:38:37,108 --> 03:38:39,109
I have a, I guess a comment and a question.

2391
03:38:39,129 --> 03:38:55,455
I just looking at one of my more recent tax bills and I see and I don't know if other people are aware of this in the upper right hand corner, there is an opportunity to pay additional taxes for

2392
03:38:56,815 --> 03:38:59,616
construction, renovation of city buildings and other things.

2393
03:38:59,776 --> 03:39:07,278
And I'm wondering the amounts that you can check off are fairly minimal, but there's also an other column as well.

2394
03:39:07,919 --> 03:39:12,840
And I'm wondering if we could add maybe the schools and DPW to that.

2395
03:39:12,860 --> 03:39:14,961
I suppose that's an assessor question.

2396
03:39:14,981 --> 03:39:25,224
And that way then the people that actually want to pay extra taxes, they are certainly welcome to do that by this avenue if they want to

2397
03:39:25,864 --> 03:39:45,898
target their money to any one particular area, the police, the fire, the library, the DPW, whatever, or maybe just have a where it's needed most, kind of like we all do if we're giving to our colleges and universities and so forth, you can give to the annual fund or you can target a particular area.

2398
03:39:45,918 --> 03:39:52,322
So I'm wondering for those who actually want to pay more taxes, if they could do it in that area,

2399
03:39:53,232 --> 03:39:53,954
With that method.

2400
03:39:54,695 --> 03:40:01,968
And then my second question is, if we were to put an override on the ballot, which I do not support.

2401
03:40:04,730 --> 03:40:06,130
How is that?

2402
03:40:06,891 --> 03:40:08,551
How much would our taxes increase?

2403
03:40:08,911 --> 03:40:10,011
Would it be a percentage?

2404
03:40:10,292 --> 03:40:13,292
Would it be a dollar figure or what?

2405
03:40:14,193 --> 03:40:26,956
And then, you know, people in this community rent and it'll trickle down into the landlords will be paying the additional taxes, of course, but it will trickle down to the renters.

2406
03:40:27,807 --> 03:40:43,344
And, you know, if you're living in a family home or something like that, and your parents are footing the bill for you, as I think is the case with some of our elected officials, then that doesn't affect them, but it will affect renters and homeowners.

2407
03:40:43,945 --> 03:40:45,287
So those are my thoughts.

2408
03:40:45,367 --> 03:40:45,787
Thank you.

2409
03:40:46,688 --> 03:40:47,309
Thank you, Eunice.

2410
03:40:51,635 --> 03:40:52,916
Sophie, new address to the record, please.

2411
03:40:52,976 --> 03:40:54,536
I see folks have spoken earlier in the meeting.

2412
03:40:54,596 --> 03:40:56,737
If we could please, please keep it brief.

2413
03:40:56,917 --> 03:40:57,997
Your comments are valuable.

2414
03:40:58,397 --> 03:40:59,598
Again, it's almost 11 p.m.

2415
03:40:59,938 --> 03:41:04,599
Madam President, I think it's also important to point out there's no paper for a proposition two and a half over right before this council this evening.

2416
03:41:04,619 --> 03:41:04,999
This is true.

2417
03:41:05,059 --> 03:41:07,580
The only thing that's before us is the operating budget, right?

2418
03:41:07,600 --> 03:41:09,721
The council is going to vote it up, vote it down and make changes to it.

2419
03:41:10,681 --> 03:41:15,302
The question of a proposition two and a half over is not something that's going to be addressed this evening or solved this evening.

2420
03:41:15,642 --> 03:41:17,443
I think the ma'am made that clear in her comments as well.

2421
03:41:18,053 --> 03:41:26,639
So maybe we could focus a little bit less on the paper that is before us, which is the FYI 2023 proposed budget.

2422
03:41:28,260 --> 03:41:29,461
Sophie, name and address the record, please.

2423
03:41:29,481 --> 03:41:29,961
And then we'll go.

2424
03:41:30,061 --> 03:41:30,501
We'll go to you.

2425
03:41:30,541 --> 03:41:30,741
Well.

2426
03:41:35,044 --> 03:41:37,466
Hi, it's Sophie Rick 78 Codding Street.

2427
03:41:39,427 --> 03:41:45,814
I am going to say that I support a prop two and a half override and charter review because that's what I was preparing to say.

2428
03:41:45,834 --> 03:41:49,218
I did send a very, very long email yesterday.

2429
03:41:49,825 --> 03:41:51,807
It details all of the reasons that I do that.

2430
03:41:51,947 --> 03:42:07,543
I appreciate that vice president bears on a comment thread had shared the impact that a prop two and a half override would have on a specific budget for a particular dollar amount.

2431
03:42:07,603 --> 03:42:11,708
And I think some of the folks maybe who don't support it perhaps aren't,

2432
03:42:12,248 --> 03:42:15,850
as aware of the particular dollar amounts that would impact them.

2433
03:42:16,010 --> 03:42:27,056
And I would also ask that the city council shares more about those exemptions for folks who are over 65 or who can't afford an additional amount.

2434
03:42:27,136 --> 03:42:28,377
I do support it myself.

2435
03:42:29,457 --> 03:42:32,259
Lastly, I just want to say I am not a teacher.

2436
03:42:32,299 --> 03:42:34,160
I'm a therapist and I work with young adults.

2437
03:42:35,120 --> 03:42:50,448
college students, and I see the impact that not having sufficient mental health resources has on the students that I work with by the time they get to me, when they haven't had the supports in high school or in elementary school, the trauma, depression, anxiety of the last few years.

2438
03:42:52,202 --> 03:42:53,623
has a very, very deep impact.

2439
03:42:54,063 --> 03:43:01,805
And I'm very concerned, specifically, I mean, I'm concerned about all of these cuts, but especially about cuts to adjustment counselors.

2440
03:43:02,206 --> 03:43:04,787
Those should not be an option to be cut.

2441
03:43:05,087 --> 03:43:10,449
None of these are good choices, and I think we need to look at raising revenue any way we can.

2442
03:43:10,629 --> 03:43:11,049
Thank you.

2443
03:43:12,389 --> 03:43:12,689
Thank you.

2444
03:43:12,909 --> 03:43:15,250
Going to Mr. Navarro in person, then we'll go back to Zoom.

2445
03:43:15,270 --> 03:43:18,932
Folks, if we could keep our comments to one minute at this point, just because we are at...

2446
03:43:20,397 --> 03:43:21,978
And one minute and the budget.

2447
03:43:23,339 --> 03:43:25,160
Thank you, Madam President, for recognizing me.

2448
03:43:25,761 --> 03:43:31,044
I just want to say that if you are a renter in Medford, you basically pay a great deal of money to be at this location.

2449
03:43:31,865 --> 03:43:34,887
And that's sort of what attracts a lot of people here.

2450
03:43:35,327 --> 03:43:46,455
But if you're somebody who rents and you're paying all that rent for this location, driven up because of its proximity to Boston and all the great amenities there, you have children or something, they're not getting the education they deserve.

2451
03:43:46,555 --> 03:43:49,397
You're still paying a lot of rent because you are at a good location.

2452
03:43:49,897 --> 03:43:55,160
And people who own real estate in this town have done incredibly, incredibly well in terms of appreciation.

2453
03:43:55,721 --> 03:44:01,945
And I just want to say that the people who read to pay a great deal to be able to do so in such a great place.

2454
03:44:02,645 --> 03:44:10,850
And I think that needs to factor into the equity argument for when we're funding the schools, making sure we're providing services to people.

2455
03:44:11,451 --> 03:44:14,433
And when we consider, you know, some kind of parity between

2456
03:44:16,452 --> 03:44:21,275
renters and owners in terms of the protections, such as PrEP two and a half and so on.

2457
03:44:21,936 --> 03:44:28,620
If we had rent control that was, it had, that would be, that'd be pretty strong rent control there.

2458
03:44:29,000 --> 03:44:29,941
So thanks.

2459
03:44:30,521 --> 03:44:31,082
Madam President.

2460
03:44:31,102 --> 03:44:33,183
Thank you.

2461
03:44:33,323 --> 03:44:39,727
Just motion that we move on from public participation and we can take up the additional public participation in the public participation section of the meeting.

2462
03:44:44,785 --> 03:44:46,986
Yeah, there's just three folks left on zoom.

2463
03:44:47,407 --> 03:44:49,148
Well, okay, don't mind sitting tight.

2464
03:44:49,588 --> 03:44:51,290
We can revisit it.

2465
03:44:53,491 --> 03:45:02,018
Okay, so I have a motion from vice chairs to hold additional public participation until after we move through this budget paper, correct?

2466
03:45:03,259 --> 03:45:04,300
Do I have a second on that motion?

2467
03:45:06,453 --> 03:45:13,942
Okay, only three people, no one else can raise their hand at this point, but you're gonna have to talk about participation after the budget paper.

2468
03:45:14,022 --> 03:45:18,087
So going to Penelope, name and address for the record, please.

2469
03:45:20,946 --> 03:45:36,027
Thanks, Penelope Taylor 29 Martin Street Medford I'll keep it brief to the mayor, I would say please designate more than 40,000 I heard 50,000 for the city council to have their own legal support, respect them to do their job and get laws written in past, and

2470
03:45:36,888 --> 03:45:39,949
As an aside, we need to use way less public money to pay KP law.

2471
03:45:40,669 --> 03:45:48,770
But the other point I just quickly wanted to make, this is me speaking, but I am a resident of Medford and a municipal worker in a nearby city.

2472
03:45:49,850 --> 03:45:54,751
Right now, Medford's budget, we hear over and over, is to do more with less for at least the next two budgets.

2473
03:45:55,871 --> 03:46:00,972
Earlier this month, we heard from department head after department head praise for finding cost-saving measures.

2474
03:46:01,432 --> 03:46:02,493
That takes creativity.

2475
03:46:02,633 --> 03:46:04,513
That takes leadership and persistence.

2476
03:46:05,153 --> 03:46:06,354
seeing the short and long term.

2477
03:46:07,035 --> 03:46:09,076
I know we can do so much more with more.

2478
03:46:09,096 --> 03:46:14,921
And one way to do that, I would say very specifically is fully funding legal support for the city council at this time.

2479
03:46:14,981 --> 03:46:15,322
Thank you.

2480
03:46:17,303 --> 03:46:17,604
Thank you.

2481
03:46:23,906 --> 03:46:47,822
Hi Teresa Fernald 13 Whittier Road, I appreciate the city council, everything you're doing just super quickly, everything that has been mentioned from Penelope and others about it's time for doing more with less is over, and I appreciate you asking the mayor for more transparency, and anything we can do to achieve

2482
03:46:49,103 --> 03:47:01,008
to do more funding, fully funding our teachers, everything the teachers have said, everything that Sam said, Nick and other city workers have come to ask for a living wage.

2483
03:47:01,428 --> 03:47:02,928
We need to do more for Medford.

2484
03:47:02,948 --> 03:47:06,970
We need to fully invest in our own future, our children's future.

2485
03:47:06,990 --> 03:47:17,394
I thank you for continuing to advocate for actual, specific recommendations from the mayor for fully more funding the city.

2486
03:47:17,794 --> 03:47:19,557
I appreciate that and you and all you're doing.

2487
03:47:19,617 --> 03:47:20,017
Thank you.

2488
03:47:21,039 --> 03:47:21,379
Thank you.

2489
03:47:22,000 --> 03:47:22,260
All right.

2490
03:47:22,280 --> 03:47:23,442
Name and address for the record, please.

2491
03:47:27,430 --> 03:47:29,152
Ari Goffman, One Chestnut Street.

2492
03:47:29,712 --> 03:47:30,533
I'll keep it brief.

2493
03:47:30,694 --> 03:47:31,494
Thank you, Council.

2494
03:47:31,915 --> 03:47:41,064
I want to go on the record in support of the Prop 2.2.5 override, increased funding for schools and libraries, independent counsel for the council and the charter review.

2495
03:47:41,084 --> 03:47:42,886
I also wanted to speak.

2496
03:47:43,667 --> 03:47:49,613
SROs have consistently been ineffective or harmful to many students, and I agree with the call to not have them in schools.

2497
03:47:50,294 --> 03:48:00,757
And finally, I want to note that there is likely a connection between the large settlements discussed earlier in this meeting in a separate agenda item, the lack of transparency and the lack of oversight.

2498
03:48:01,597 --> 03:48:06,258
And I would like to call for a public investigation as part of the long-term budget work on the city.

2499
03:48:07,339 --> 03:48:07,639
Thank you.

2500
03:48:09,219 --> 03:48:11,800
And last, Mr. Casagnani snuck in.

2501
03:48:12,700 --> 03:48:16,381
Mr. Casagnani, for the sake of Councilor Knight's health, please don't bring up Prop 2.5.

2502
03:48:16,421 --> 03:48:18,902
Please go ahead.

2503
03:48:22,801 --> 03:48:25,782
Mr. Castagnetti, maybe he walked away.

2504
03:48:28,243 --> 03:48:30,944
Hello, Prez Morrell.

2505
03:48:31,044 --> 03:48:31,525
Can you hear me?

2506
03:48:32,285 --> 03:48:37,107
Can you hear me dear?

2507
03:48:37,527 --> 03:48:46,911
I just wanted to say, I just wanted to say it's been a long, long, long night for you people, but you must be tired.

2508
03:48:48,032 --> 03:48:50,953
And, uh, what can I say?

2509
03:48:50,973 --> 03:48:51,013
Uh,

2510
03:48:51,832 --> 03:48:57,415
There are a lot of really good teachers that I know of, and there are some that are not so good, eh?

2511
03:48:59,216 --> 03:49:04,199
But with a $201 million budget, hopefully we can make things do.

2512
03:49:05,080 --> 03:49:09,583
And because it's just got to happen.

2513
03:49:10,223 --> 03:49:13,325
I just have one question for Vice President Beers.

2514
03:49:13,865 --> 03:49:16,387
Are you running for mayor, my dear?

2515
03:49:16,407 --> 03:49:19,168
Thank you, Mr. Castaneda.

2516
03:49:19,188 --> 03:49:20,109
You don't have to do that.

2517
03:49:23,287 --> 03:49:24,608
Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti, okay.

2518
03:49:26,189 --> 03:49:28,551
Vice, Mr. Murphy, if you could be brief.

2519
03:49:28,631 --> 03:49:29,973
No, Madam President, if I may.

2520
03:49:34,396 --> 03:49:35,537
I know, you're right.

2521
03:49:35,677 --> 03:49:35,918
No.

2522
03:49:35,978 --> 03:49:39,180
Okay, Vice President Barris, do you have something that needs to go before Mr. Murphy?

2523
03:49:39,200 --> 03:49:39,601
Yes, I do.

2524
03:49:39,661 --> 03:49:40,361
Okay, please.

2525
03:49:40,381 --> 03:49:47,868
So I just wanna now discuss now that we're at action points, specifically what law applies to the city council as pursuant to the budget process.

2526
03:49:48,008 --> 03:49:49,149
Under our current city charter,

2527
03:49:50,009 --> 03:50:06,157
We fully adopt Chapter 44, Section 32 of Mass General Laws as pertained to our charter, which specifically says the City Council may by majority vote make appropriations for the purposes recommended and may reduce or reject any amount recommended in the annual budget.

2528
03:50:06,857 --> 03:50:14,663
It shall not increase any amount in or the total of the annual budget nor add there to any amount for a purpose not included therein except on recommendation of the mayor.

2529
03:50:15,484 --> 03:50:26,393
It also says that, excuse me one second, if the council fails to take action with respect to any amount recommended in the annual budget either by approving, reducing, or rejecting the same,

2530
03:50:27,013 --> 03:50:38,456
within 45 days after the receipt of the budget, such amount shall without any action by the city council become a part of the appropriations for the year and be available for the purposes specified.

2531
03:50:38,956 --> 03:50:43,998
So what that means is that this council can approve the budget,

2532
03:50:44,998 --> 03:50:52,286
it can reduce specific line items, and if it wanted to, it could go in and reject every single line item, and then there'd be no appropriations.

2533
03:50:52,386 --> 03:50:58,652
However, if the council does not approve this budget, after 45 days, it automatically goes into effect.

2534
03:50:59,273 --> 03:51:04,078
Earlier this month, I reached out to the State Division of Local Services Municipal Finance Law Team.

2535
03:51:04,558 --> 03:51:07,722
The lawyers there said that if the budget were not approved,

2536
03:51:08,202 --> 03:51:16,249
unless we were to go through every single line item and cut every line item in the budget, which would keep us here until about four in the morning, that would not stop any function of city government.

2537
03:51:17,069 --> 03:51:24,155
And that mass general law chapter 44, section 32, once again, says that the budget will go into effect 45 days after submission to the council.

2538
03:51:25,276 --> 03:51:34,123
So at this point, you know, if this council were not to approve the budget tonight, any reduction in service or spending in the new fiscal year would not be because of that.

2539
03:51:34,183 --> 03:51:36,265
It would be due to the municipal

2540
03:51:36,890 --> 03:51:39,653
decisions of the chief executive officer of the city of Medford.

2541
03:51:40,374 --> 03:51:49,204
And I also have several motions regarding both some suggested cuts as well as some recommendations for increases to the fiscal 23 budget.

2542
03:51:49,904 --> 03:51:53,268
I'm happy to make those recommendations at any time if you so recognize me.

2543
03:51:57,319 --> 03:51:57,659
Keep going.

2544
03:51:58,039 --> 03:52:07,225
So one of the things we discovered in our budget hearings was that six fire department positions cannot be filled until next May.

2545
03:52:08,226 --> 03:52:10,808
And that's almost the end of the fiscal year.

2546
03:52:11,508 --> 03:52:23,736
So taking the, it's not quite a calf, but looking at the base salary, that would allow us to make a cut, not to the positions, not to not have them in the budget next year,

2547
03:52:24,436 --> 03:52:27,719
Literally the way that the hiring process works, they can't be filled until May.

2548
03:52:28,300 --> 03:52:41,572
If we were to cut 240,000 from that line, that could free up a significant amount of money to go towards our library, to go towards our law department, to go towards some other expenses.

2549
03:52:42,193 --> 03:52:46,377
So I would move, and that amount would be $40,000 over six positions.

2550
03:52:49,479 --> 03:52:51,480
So that's $240,000 total.

2551
03:52:51,560 --> 03:52:55,462
I would move to reduce the fire salaries permanent FT line item 010-220-5110.

2552
03:52:55,862 --> 03:52:58,563
That's the specific line item by $240,000.

2553
03:52:58,723 --> 03:53:01,965
Do I have a second on that motion?

2554
03:53:01,985 --> 03:53:02,905
Seconded by Councilor Sang.

2555
03:53:22,332 --> 03:53:26,656
Do you want to take, would the council like to take the motions as they come, or do you want to hear all of his motions first?

2556
03:53:26,676 --> 03:53:32,841
I think we should, pursuant to section 32, I think we should have, we have to have a vote on each one.

2557
03:53:32,861 --> 03:53:35,243
So maybe we could just go in sequence and vote on them as they're proposed.

2558
03:53:35,683 --> 03:53:35,903
Okay.

2559
03:53:38,346 --> 03:53:41,528
I'm happy to hear from Chief Friedman first, if he disagrees with my reading of it.

2560
03:53:47,693 --> 03:53:49,415
There's a little face, yeah.

2561
03:53:53,655 --> 03:53:53,915
Got it?

2562
03:53:56,278 --> 03:53:56,698
It was on.

2563
03:53:56,918 --> 03:53:58,160
There you go.

2564
03:53:58,300 --> 03:53:59,041
It's gone.

2565
03:53:59,381 --> 03:53:59,922
He's on now.

2566
03:54:01,063 --> 03:54:10,113
Okay, so when I look at my budget, I really strongly don't recommend you cut any of my budget at all.

2567
03:54:11,274 --> 03:54:13,176
It's already leaned out to the point where

2568
03:54:14,793 --> 03:54:24,281
those positions that are vacant, when we get reduced down and I go over on my overtime budget, that money is actually keeping the department running.

2569
03:54:24,841 --> 03:54:31,406
If you cut those positions, I'm gonna run into, it's gonna be a nightmare.

2570
03:54:31,446 --> 03:54:36,010
I'm gonna end up running out of money, and then what do I do then at that point?

2571
03:54:36,915 --> 03:54:52,503
So, and I understand when you're looking at every angle of the budget, but when we initially had our meetings with the mayor, we got a major deficit going on and I allowed them to cut me down to a level that's the lowest it's ever been.

2572
03:54:53,223 --> 03:54:58,306
And if you're gonna cut me again, what's gonna happen is when I go over, because it's gonna go over,

2573
03:54:58,954 --> 03:55:00,375
We're gonna lose more people next year.

2574
03:55:00,395 --> 03:55:01,115
I did look into it.

2575
03:55:01,135 --> 03:55:04,497
The council did ask me about people that are leaving.

2576
03:55:04,537 --> 03:55:08,739
I have two that are gonna leave this budget, the 23 budget that have to leave.

2577
03:55:08,759 --> 03:55:09,540
They're gonna age out.

2578
03:55:10,220 --> 03:55:13,182
And I have two more that are pretty much on their way out.

2579
03:55:13,962 --> 03:55:15,143
So that's gonna be four.

2580
03:55:16,323 --> 03:55:22,707
And the whole thing about replacing them and taking the time to replace them,

2581
03:55:24,083 --> 03:55:29,405
We have, like I said, we have eight coming on, we got four in the fall, two groups of four.

2582
03:55:32,386 --> 03:55:35,927
And when we initially looked at the budget, I had more positions there.

2583
03:55:36,628 --> 03:55:45,331
And the reason I had them there was because exactly what happened this year, I went over because of the lack, we can't reduce the manpower, we have a minimum manning.

2584
03:55:46,031 --> 03:55:48,932
So if you're gonna take those positions out,

2585
03:55:50,201 --> 03:55:53,543
I'm gonna be back here in front of the council when I run out of money, what do I do then?

2586
03:55:54,724 --> 03:56:03,189
So we work together with the mayor to try and get this down to a level where we did our part and now you're gonna cut me further.

2587
03:56:03,569 --> 03:56:07,411
So when I hear that, that was news to me tonight.

2588
03:56:07,431 --> 03:56:10,813
So first I heard of that, I'm shaking my boots right now.

2589
03:56:10,833 --> 03:56:11,934
Okay.

2590
03:56:12,054 --> 03:56:12,434
I hear that.

2591
03:56:12,694 --> 03:56:17,757
I have a couple of clarified questions or so I understand it and I'll withdraw it if the answers are what I think they're gonna be.

2592
03:56:18,767 --> 03:56:27,138
You mentioned in the budget hearing that we currently have, so we're budgeted for 81 firefighters, not including the lieutenants, captains, deputy chiefs.

2593
03:56:27,879 --> 03:56:29,961
We're currently at 66, if I'm correct.

2594
03:56:30,602 --> 03:56:31,603
You said that in the budget hearing?

2595
03:56:34,333 --> 03:56:36,775
I'm trying to think what question you were asking.

2596
03:56:36,835 --> 03:56:40,658
So you're asking how many firefighters on budget fall out versus how many are actually here.

2597
03:56:40,759 --> 03:56:46,623
What I'm saying is, at least this was my understanding, and I'm not trying to put you in any sort of gotcha position at all.

2598
03:56:47,124 --> 03:56:48,625
Just my, here's my thinking on it.

2599
03:56:49,566 --> 03:56:51,607
And we're budgeted for 81 here.

2600
03:56:53,429 --> 03:57:00,014
What I heard is that we had 66 currently, eight more in the pipeline, and then six more who you were hoping to bring up to bring us back up to that 81.

2601
03:57:01,983 --> 03:57:03,545
or sorry, 80, my apologies.

2602
03:57:03,965 --> 03:57:08,508
And then, but we wouldn't be able to get people into the academies until May on that.

2603
03:57:09,529 --> 03:57:20,297
Right, well, obviously, there are other ways, there are other academies, we could definitely work on getting them in the academy if the administration was gonna fill it.

2604
03:57:20,777 --> 03:57:23,740
And I don't think that's a wise decision at this point in time.

2605
03:57:24,120 --> 03:57:25,121
Okay.

2606
03:57:26,282 --> 03:57:26,462
So,

2607
03:57:28,106 --> 03:57:34,454
If what you're saying, you're gonna take those positions away, then that's- Just a part of the year when we couldn't have them filled is all I'm suggesting.

2608
03:57:36,056 --> 03:57:39,861
Up until, not even May, even before that, I was thinking more like February.

2609
03:57:41,474 --> 03:57:46,557
Yeah, I just, the reason I, I mean, I went over this year on the overtime budget.

2610
03:57:47,197 --> 03:57:54,581
And if we don't get people in there until the fall, then I'm gonna be in the same position in the next budget.

2611
03:57:55,041 --> 03:58:01,204
And I feel like I had some money left over this year, but that was only because I was, you know, I had those positions there.

2612
03:58:01,984 --> 03:58:02,805
Now you've cut them.

2613
03:58:03,345 --> 03:58:06,267
So now what's gonna happen is next year, that money's gone.

2614
03:58:06,787 --> 03:58:08,468
It's gonna be really tight next year.

2615
03:58:09,358 --> 03:58:11,839
the way it currently sits.

2616
03:58:12,159 --> 03:58:15,041
I'm happy to accept that.

2617
03:58:15,061 --> 03:58:17,282
I just want to make that note before you make that cut.

2618
03:58:17,302 --> 03:58:18,883
I understand that's what you're looking to do.

2619
03:58:18,903 --> 03:58:19,783
You're looking to make a cut.

2620
03:58:20,244 --> 03:58:33,070
Well, I was looking for a place in the budget where maybe we were spending, budgeting for more than we were actually going to spend to help us move that, or recommend we move it to somewhere in the budget where the need is greater than what we're going to spend.

2621
03:58:33,090 --> 03:58:34,591
That's what the administration has already done.

2622
03:58:34,611 --> 03:58:36,392
They've already taken a bunch of money.

2623
03:58:36,412 --> 03:58:37,913
If you look at those line items, they took,

2624
03:58:39,214 --> 03:58:42,076
$192,000, right, out of there.

2625
03:58:42,516 --> 03:58:45,238
And then they- Those NDA transfers, right?

2626
03:58:45,258 --> 03:58:51,783
So ultimately you had $194,000 of surplus funds in your account from last- Right, those are because I had those extra positions that are now gone.

2627
03:58:51,823 --> 03:58:56,087
Budgeted positions that were vacant, so we didn't have a true number of your actual operating budget.

2628
03:58:56,247 --> 03:58:59,910
I'm new at it, so I think those are, they're on purpose, okay?

2629
03:58:59,950 --> 03:59:03,532
Because they know that when you're staffed to slow, the overtime's gonna go over.

2630
03:59:03,552 --> 03:59:08,176
Right, and that's why we talked about the $1.9 million appropriations overtime and whether or not you're gonna be able

2631
03:59:08,903 --> 03:59:12,724
Yeah, and only being there five months, I wasn't aware of it when I first walked through the door.

2632
03:59:13,384 --> 03:59:16,565
At the end, when I'm looking at the money, I'm going, okay, I understand it now.

2633
03:59:17,586 --> 03:59:19,806
So- Just if I may clarify.

2634
03:59:19,826 --> 03:59:28,209
So what you're saying is, even though the positions may be vacant through most of the fiscal year, that money is going to go to pay overtime for other people to work because those positions are vacant.

2635
03:59:28,229 --> 03:59:28,889
Absolutely.

2636
03:59:28,909 --> 03:59:31,470
You take that away from that, I am gonna run out of money.

2637
03:59:31,850 --> 03:59:32,411
I withdraw the motion.

2638
03:59:32,431 --> 03:59:33,391
And I'm gonna be before the council.

2639
03:59:33,751 --> 03:59:34,931
I withdraw the motion, thank you.

2640
03:59:35,351 --> 03:59:36,252
Thank you, Vice President Harris.

2641
03:59:36,332 --> 03:59:36,612
Thank you.

2642
03:59:39,022 --> 03:59:39,683
Madam President.

2643
03:59:42,225 --> 03:59:43,666
Have I talked about legal services?

2644
03:59:44,947 --> 03:59:46,128
I honestly don't know anymore.

2645
03:59:46,148 --> 03:59:52,214
There is a line item in our budget number 0101515302.

2646
03:59:55,797 --> 03:59:59,060
Last year, I put forward a motion asking that this line item be cut by the amount of $55,000.

2647
03:59:59,100 --> 03:59:59,560
Council passed it.

2648
04:00:03,353 --> 04:00:08,378
Around January, the administration came back and asked for supplemental appropriation to the budget, the amount of $55,000.

2649
04:00:08,898 --> 04:00:09,919
That appropriation passed.

2650
04:00:10,399 --> 04:00:11,540
That was the fund KP law.

2651
04:00:12,421 --> 04:00:18,166
As we look at our budget this year, we see that line item has a dollar figure attached to it of $81,600.

2652
04:00:19,067 --> 04:00:26,414
I'd ask that that budget be reduced by $81,600 for that particular line item for professional legal services, Madam President.

2653
04:00:29,027 --> 04:00:35,432
I could go into the thousand reasons that I've stated previously, but I'll spare everybody based upon the late hour.

2654
04:00:35,732 --> 04:00:36,093
Thank you.

2655
04:00:36,353 --> 04:00:38,314
Do I have a second on that motion from Councilor Knight?

2656
04:00:40,656 --> 04:00:41,877
Seconded by Councilor Collins.

2657
04:00:44,059 --> 04:00:45,820
Mr. Clerk, if you could please call the roll.

2658
04:00:49,083 --> 04:00:52,425
Seconded by Councilor Collins.

2659
04:00:54,487 --> 04:00:55,188
Could you repeat the number?

2660
04:01:05,368 --> 04:01:06,269
Pages it in the budget book?

2661
04:01:06,289 --> 04:01:14,457
Thank you.

2662
04:01:20,984 --> 04:01:21,504
President Morrell?

2663
04:01:23,073 --> 04:01:24,554
Madam Chief of staff, if you could be brief.

2664
04:01:24,574 --> 04:01:24,894
Thank you.

2665
04:01:24,934 --> 04:01:25,555
Yes, absolutely.

2666
04:01:26,035 --> 04:01:37,383
If the City Council does, in fact, reduce that budget line item, I'd be interested to understand what the City Council would propose and who would do the work that's being presently done by KP law.

2667
04:01:38,004 --> 04:01:41,266
There will likely not be any representation at these meetings.

2668
04:01:41,806 --> 04:01:45,589
There will not be likely ordinances that will be drafted by KP law.

2669
04:01:46,089 --> 04:01:46,830
There has been 10 or more

2670
04:01:49,467 --> 04:01:53,129
drafted ordinances for the City Council over the course of the last fiscal year.

2671
04:01:53,149 --> 04:01:55,069
I just want to point that out.

2672
04:01:55,149 --> 04:01:55,469
Thank you.

2673
04:01:55,910 --> 04:01:56,190
Thank you.

2674
04:01:56,530 --> 04:02:01,892
Well, apparently, Madam President, the Council is doing much more than one ordinance per year, as stated previously.

2675
04:02:02,172 --> 04:02:03,673
I guess we're getting some good work done.

2676
04:02:05,793 --> 04:02:07,514
I quite frankly think we can operate without them.

2677
04:02:08,032 --> 04:02:08,752
I don't think we need them.

2678
04:02:09,512 --> 04:02:18,454
I think that that money could be better spent, quite frankly, maybe with a zoning consultant to begin phase two of our zoning recartification.

2679
04:02:18,474 --> 04:02:28,556
As we sat here for the last couple of weeks and we looked, we saw that we were able to generate millions of dollars in funds for this community through the recartification effort with the creation of an O2 district.

2680
04:02:29,336 --> 04:02:34,357
We've generated probably close to $6 million worth of permitting fees and new growth in the community based upon this effort.

2681
04:02:34,377 --> 04:02:35,838
So I think that this is a worthwhile endeavor.

2682
04:02:35,858 --> 04:02:37,658
I think it's a good expense, to be honest with you.

2683
04:02:38,739 --> 04:02:40,400
And I think making the cut makes sense.

2684
04:02:41,841 --> 04:02:43,041
Thank you, Madam President.

2685
04:02:43,782 --> 04:02:57,812
I believe that I as one counselor would certainly invite a supplemental appropriation that addresses the requests of this council that have not been fulfilled and potentially also balances that with the requests of the administration that have not been fulfilled.

2686
04:02:59,173 --> 04:03:02,255
And, you know, sadly, this is the point that we've come to.

2687
04:03:03,628 --> 04:03:14,033
for years that I've been on this council, for six months that I've been in leadership of this council, we've been sitting in, saying what we need, saying these are specific requests of the council.

2688
04:03:14,554 --> 04:03:20,717
And quite frankly, there were like five pretty small potatoes asks of this council that we had.

2689
04:03:21,820 --> 04:03:23,221
that are nowhere to be found in this budget.

2690
04:03:23,882 --> 04:03:37,892
Now we're at the point where the only way we're going to be able to have that conversation and quite literally the only legal power we have over the budget is to make a cut and then sit down and say, what can you provide us in a supplemental appropriation so that we can come to an agreement?

2691
04:03:38,272 --> 04:03:40,854
I'm sorry that it's gotten to that point, but it is what it is.

2692
04:03:41,175 --> 04:03:41,535
Thank you.

2693
04:03:42,335 --> 04:03:42,596
Thank you.

2694
04:03:43,116 --> 04:03:43,556
Chief Buckley.

2695
04:03:47,459 --> 04:03:48,980
There you go.

2696
04:03:49,000 --> 04:03:49,341
It's on.

2697
04:03:49,361 --> 04:03:50,642
You don't have to touch anything.

2698
04:03:52,180 --> 04:04:03,867
So if I just want to just as cleanly as I can say this and put this, if you cut KP law, you're going to severely impact what's going on in the police department right now.

2699
04:04:04,027 --> 04:04:09,370
KP law for the last year plus has been kind of guiding me through police reform.

2700
04:04:09,971 --> 04:04:12,612
This is nothing that is easy right now.

2701
04:04:12,912 --> 04:04:16,895
And if you pay attention to what's going on, it's changing on a daily basis.

2702
04:04:18,147 --> 04:04:28,356
I am an expert in law enforcement, and I do not have the ability to keep up with what the Commonwealth of Massachusetts is putting on police as much as we try.

2703
04:04:28,977 --> 04:04:30,178
Kim Scanlon is great.

2704
04:04:30,658 --> 04:04:37,685
She handles all of my firearms licensing issues, and those are going to go through the roof right now with the US Supreme Court decision that's coming up.

2705
04:04:40,983 --> 04:04:55,147
We are at a critical point in policing right now with a lot of the changes, a lot of, there's a demand for, you know, we've got the CCOPS versions, we've got 41 cameras that may fall into this, we've got all these demanded policy changes.

2706
04:04:55,867 --> 04:04:59,088
I have to do civil fingerprinting, we've just changed the constable ordinances.

2707
04:04:59,528 --> 04:05:04,750
All of that was done with the assistance of KP Law, not to mention that labor,

2708
04:05:06,183 --> 04:05:13,007
on the sides of, say, contract negotiations and, say, grievance and unfair labor practice judgments.

2709
04:05:13,027 --> 04:05:20,931
We have minimum on the police side, but the labor negotiations for police coming up are going to be a very critical issue, right?

2710
04:05:20,971 --> 04:05:22,432
Because policing has changed.

2711
04:05:22,972 --> 04:05:29,015
If you eliminate KP law, you're putting me at a severe disadvantage going forward.

2712
04:05:29,515 --> 04:05:31,216
I just have to tell you that right up front.

2713
04:05:31,376 --> 04:05:32,617
There's no other way around it.

2714
04:05:33,658 --> 04:05:33,938
Thank you.

2715
04:05:35,793 --> 04:05:38,614
I just like to point out that we were able to do it without KPMG law previously.

2716
04:05:41,195 --> 04:05:42,215
I understand the chief's point.

2717
04:05:42,315 --> 04:05:46,816
I understand the chief's point about reform and how things have changed, and I do, and I get it, chief.

2718
04:05:46,836 --> 04:05:47,217
I understand that.

2719
04:05:47,257 --> 04:05:51,118
I respect and understand it, but nothing like what is going on in the last year, year and a half.

2720
04:05:51,278 --> 04:05:52,058
Nothing like that.

2721
04:05:52,378 --> 04:05:53,038
Thank you.

2722
04:05:53,258 --> 04:05:56,579
If I may, a supplemental information could be made quickly.

2723
04:05:56,659 --> 04:05:56,939
Thank you.

2724
04:06:00,472 --> 04:06:09,940
Okay, but just the implementation of police reform to come out of the purchasing office if that's the case for a specific scope of service for that, for that purpose.

2725
04:06:10,301 --> 04:06:11,181
Thank you.

2726
04:06:11,221 --> 04:06:15,245
So, I just wanted to add about KP law as a new chief.

2727
04:06:16,493 --> 04:06:21,295
You know, I don't have all the legal precedents in my mind yet, especially being as new as I am.

2728
04:06:21,335 --> 04:06:25,457
And I lean on them constantly when I look at legal precedents.

2729
04:06:26,178 --> 04:06:30,200
So if we eliminate them, how do I get that guidance?

2730
04:06:30,340 --> 04:06:35,702
Well, I would assume we have a city solicitor in this community that would pick up the phone and take that call and be able to provide you with that guidance, Chief.

2731
04:06:35,742 --> 04:06:36,923
And I think that that's part of the problem.

2732
04:06:36,963 --> 04:06:45,507
I think we're moving away from our in-house city solicitor, who has the institutional knowledge of 20 years of working in this building, and we're moving away from them to a private service

2733
04:06:45,923 --> 04:06:48,866
that's being paid where we see a new face every other day and a new person every other day.

2734
04:06:50,207 --> 04:06:58,914
Right now, when Councilor Caviello met with the mayor to discuss the future of legal services here to the council, the discussion was pretty clear.

2735
04:06:59,255 --> 04:07:01,317
The mayor made an offer, the council rejected it.

2736
04:07:01,757 --> 04:07:04,680
The mayor said that's your offer and walked away and that was it.

2737
04:07:04,760 --> 04:07:09,624
And then there was no negotiation discussion about it until tonight when we heard that there might be

2738
04:07:10,064 --> 04:07:22,409
reallocation of funds that they're going to take it out of the negotiated salary accounts, which is set up to provide the funds for your employees and for the employees that sit behind you to fund this want for the council and it's not really a want it's a need we need this right.

2739
04:07:22,789 --> 04:07:26,451
So, quite frankly, we did this last year and we were able to survive.

2740
04:07:27,719 --> 04:07:28,400
We're able to survive.

2741
04:07:28,460 --> 04:07:35,067
We did it last year, we're able to survive, but I don't think it's something that's going to impact our operations to the point of red flags.

2742
04:07:35,567 --> 04:07:37,469
I think that it's something that we're going to be able to work through.

2743
04:07:37,930 --> 04:07:44,637
And if the administration is serious about what they said, but they want to work with us and they want to put together a budget that works, then we'll be happy to come back to the table and discuss this further.

2744
04:07:45,237 --> 04:07:47,840
But the council needs certain tools in their toolbox to be successful as well.

2745
04:07:50,099 --> 04:07:50,499
Thank you.

2746
04:07:50,519 --> 04:07:55,323
And I appreciate all the department heads running around scaring and getting nervous.

2747
04:07:55,943 --> 04:07:57,465
So you know exactly how I feel.

2748
04:07:59,386 --> 04:08:02,749
That's exactly how we feel sitting behind this rail.

2749
04:08:02,769 --> 04:08:07,593
And it's sad that it has to be that, that brings to this point.

2750
04:08:08,433 --> 04:08:17,321
Because if we would listen to, and that's a sad part of this, because I know that it puts everybody in a bad spot, but that's exactly how we feel.

2751
04:08:18,479 --> 04:08:25,783
When we get attacked, and we don't have the answer, and no one's answering the question for us legally.

2752
04:08:33,122 --> 04:08:35,824
by putting me in that position, it's not gonna help.

2753
04:08:36,144 --> 04:08:39,305
I mean... We didn't put this budget together, Chief.

2754
04:08:39,325 --> 04:08:39,765
The mayor did.

2755
04:08:39,865 --> 04:08:41,066
The mayor's putting you in this position.

2756
04:08:41,106 --> 04:08:41,886
It's up to us to take a vote.

2757
04:08:41,906 --> 04:08:43,807
You're talking about cutting KP law.

2758
04:08:43,847 --> 04:08:48,350
That is sort of a shoulder I lean on when I need legal precedence decided.

2759
04:08:48,450 --> 04:08:55,893
And if our legal department is busy or they can't answer me, sometimes I need timely answers and I have to lean on them.

2760
04:08:55,913 --> 04:08:56,213
That's all.

2761
04:08:56,253 --> 04:08:57,234
I just wanna make that known.

2762
04:08:58,444 --> 04:09:04,132
As I was saying before, the council did vote to cut KP law last year, and seemingly there was no break in service.

2763
04:09:04,272 --> 04:09:06,855
So I'm not even sure what impact it has, honestly.

2764
04:09:06,875 --> 04:09:10,480
It's because the administration seemed to operate the way they wanted to operate anyways.

2765
04:09:10,660 --> 04:09:11,381
Councilor Carviel.

2766
04:09:11,582 --> 04:09:12,223
Thank you, Madam President.

2767
04:09:13,042 --> 04:09:16,163
Where was KP Law when we were having a suit with Cheviot?

2768
04:09:16,704 --> 04:09:17,564
They were nowhere to be found.

2769
04:09:17,584 --> 04:09:22,026
They went and defended Everett and left us stuck here holding the bag.

2770
04:09:22,426 --> 04:09:26,548
So we had to go out and allocate money to pay for another law firm.

2771
04:09:26,888 --> 04:09:35,853
And we expected the gentleman who runs the building to take money out of his pocket to pay for legal fees on a building that we own.

2772
04:09:36,313 --> 04:09:37,333
Where was KP Law?

2773
04:09:38,034 --> 04:09:40,695
Over in Everett defending them, not defending the city of Medford.

2774
04:09:42,010 --> 04:09:42,870
Thank you, Councilor Carvalho.

2775
04:09:44,571 --> 04:09:45,331
Commissioner McGibbon.

2776
04:09:45,971 --> 04:09:46,952
Thank you very much, President Morrell.

2777
04:09:46,972 --> 04:09:49,693
I just wanted to speak in favor of KP Law.

2778
04:09:49,853 --> 04:10:05,018
I've been working both with our legal department and KP Law as city engineer and DPW director, and they've been extremely valuable to me, especially with the 5G hearings I received

2779
04:10:06,007 --> 04:10:17,972
you know, plenty of advisement when it came to that particular set of tasks that I had to handle, as well as, you know, we got the negotiations, contract negotiations coming up, advisement on those.

2780
04:10:19,032 --> 04:10:24,494
They've also been pretty critical when I have been trying to, and Ms.

2781
04:10:24,534 --> 04:10:31,597
Galen's office as well, negotiate rights of way takings, formal easements and things like that.

2782
04:10:31,977 --> 04:10:33,278
So they've been pretty critical.

2783
04:10:33,620 --> 04:10:43,885
And also too, one of the things I've been working on here in the city is just sorting out private ways, public ways, and the way we're focusing our services.

2784
04:10:44,286 --> 04:10:47,207
And they've been pretty critical when it comes to that as well.

2785
04:10:47,507 --> 04:10:49,628
So just wanted to put the plug out there.

2786
04:10:49,808 --> 04:10:50,549
So thank you.

2787
04:10:51,909 --> 04:10:52,150
Thank you.

2788
04:10:59,608 --> 04:11:07,430
just one quick thing to talk about recreation and a lot of KPR as well we have you some previous times.

2789
04:11:07,450 --> 04:11:14,092
You know you probably don't think that recreation uses them very often but really with the Park Commission home commission.

2790
04:11:14,992 --> 04:11:22,574
KPI has helped us out to help make sure that we have the correct liability insurance and that our applications are correct.

2791
04:11:23,673 --> 04:11:35,881
And even with Kim Scanlon, there's many times that different legal matters come up or a quick question comes where I need to consult with the law department.

2792
04:11:35,941 --> 04:11:45,086
Kim has been really great, but I can only imagine how much harder it's gonna be to be able to reach and talk with her if she's pulling extra work, not have KP law.

2793
04:11:45,747 --> 04:11:48,388
So I just wanna put that in perspective too.

2794
04:11:48,408 --> 04:11:49,609
Mr. Bailey, I can appreciate that.

2795
04:11:49,689 --> 04:11:50,490
I mean, here we have,

2796
04:11:51,633 --> 04:12:01,790
But just city departments we get the city budget here and as I look at this budget and I see all the city departments talking about how they need legal services right and then I look at the budget here and I see the city department it's called legislative.

2797
04:12:02,903 --> 04:12:03,263
That's us.

2798
04:12:03,723 --> 04:12:08,705
We're a city department as well, and we also need the service, and we're not getting it to the level that we need it at.

2799
04:12:08,725 --> 04:12:09,885
So that's why we're taking the action.

2800
04:12:09,905 --> 04:12:11,286
That's why I'm taking the action I'm taking.

2801
04:12:11,306 --> 04:12:12,506
I don't know what my colleagues are gonna do.

2802
04:12:13,206 --> 04:12:15,767
They've supported this measure in the past, and I'm pretty sure they're gonna support it again.

2803
04:12:16,547 --> 04:12:22,889
But I think that, again, like Councilor Scott Kelly said, all those things that they do for you, they don't do for us, but we need them to do for us.

2804
04:12:23,109 --> 04:12:25,070
And that's why we're making this move.

2805
04:12:25,610 --> 04:12:25,750
Yeah.

2806
04:12:26,090 --> 04:12:30,412
just want to put perspective where recreation stands on legal matters.

2807
04:12:30,432 --> 04:12:35,095
If I may, we could have every department head come up here and say the same thing you did, Kevin, and we don't disagree with you at all.

2808
04:12:36,315 --> 04:12:41,018
But the problem is that this budget doesn't address the full scope of legal services for you guys or for us.

2809
04:12:41,938 --> 04:12:46,921
And we've been saying for six months that this is a key priority of our council, our top priority.

2810
04:12:48,134 --> 04:12:49,115
not included in the budget.

2811
04:12:49,475 --> 04:12:50,596
We have one shot at it.

2812
04:12:50,876 --> 04:12:52,677
We have a single tool in our toolbox.

2813
04:12:52,877 --> 04:12:55,979
I wish we had a different one, but state law says this is all we can do.

2814
04:12:56,560 --> 04:13:08,288
So as I said, if the council votes to cut this line item, I hope that very promptly we will see a supplemental appropriation from the administration to create a legal budget that meets all the needs.

2815
04:13:08,908 --> 04:13:10,869
I voted for a KP law budget before.

2816
04:13:10,909 --> 04:13:17,134
I've said that if we can have the staffing we need in house and the outside council we need out of house, I would gladly support that.

2817
04:13:17,975 --> 04:13:21,596
So, again, we've been very clear for months.

2818
04:13:22,596 --> 04:13:23,416
We haven't been heard.

2819
04:13:24,156 --> 04:13:28,257
We're at the last minute, the last day, the last meeting, the last chance.

2820
04:13:29,317 --> 04:13:30,057
I'm sorry we're here.

2821
04:13:30,937 --> 04:13:32,077
We didn't put ourselves here.

2822
04:13:32,598 --> 04:13:36,258
We've been very clear and direct for half a year.

2823
04:13:36,918 --> 04:13:38,959
So I'm sorry if that's gonna have an impact.

2824
04:13:40,379 --> 04:13:42,319
I hope it's really short and that's up to the mayor.

2825
04:13:44,400 --> 04:13:44,720
Thank you.

2826
04:13:46,220 --> 04:13:46,940
Chief Stephens-Aaron.

2827
04:13:48,817 --> 04:13:51,419
to the members of the city council.

2828
04:13:51,439 --> 04:13:55,181
I mean, this isn't about KP law or any other legal firm.

2829
04:13:55,261 --> 04:13:58,563
The fact of the matter is, and I've said it before, and I'll just say it very briefly.

2830
04:13:58,983 --> 04:14:02,805
The fact of the matter is we need in-depth legal support.

2831
04:14:03,466 --> 04:14:03,806
That's all.

2832
04:14:03,926 --> 04:14:04,246
Thank you.

2833
04:14:04,666 --> 04:14:04,887
Thank you.

2834
04:14:05,647 --> 04:14:06,427
No objection.

2835
04:14:07,708 --> 04:14:15,313
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Collins.

2836
04:14:16,373 --> 04:14:17,454
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2837
04:14:20,012 --> 04:14:20,772
Vice President Behrs?

2838
04:14:20,913 --> 04:14:21,213
Yes.

2839
04:14:22,193 --> 04:14:22,954
Councilor Kerrio?

2840
04:14:23,114 --> 04:14:23,374
Yes.

2841
04:14:24,435 --> 04:14:25,135
Councilor Collins?

2842
04:14:25,415 --> 04:14:25,636
Yes.

2843
04:14:26,776 --> 04:14:27,277
Councilor Knight?

2844
04:14:27,477 --> 04:14:27,717
Yes.

2845
04:14:28,457 --> 04:14:29,278
Councilor Scarpelli?

2846
04:14:29,518 --> 04:14:29,698
Yes.

2847
04:14:30,339 --> 04:14:30,939
Councilor Seng?

2848
04:14:31,159 --> 04:14:31,379
Yes.

2849
04:14:31,840 --> 04:14:32,460
President Morrell?

2850
04:14:32,620 --> 04:14:32,800
Yes.

2851
04:14:33,080 --> 04:14:35,082
Senator Fernandez, you're on the negative, the motion passes.

2852
04:14:36,743 --> 04:14:47,670
Madam President, last meeting we talked a little bit about our prestigious historic commission and I had discussed my desire to slash that budget based upon the

2853
04:14:48,634 --> 04:14:56,421
actions that they tend to live by, which is not, in my opinion, good for business here in the city of Medford.

2854
04:14:57,702 --> 04:15:01,686
Ultimately, we do have an appropriation before us for what looks like $36,500, but part of that's a matching grant.

2855
04:15:05,371 --> 04:15:18,888
And if I can get a commitment from my colleagues to have a committee of the whole on this to discuss the ordinance, I'd be happy to move off of my defunding of the historic commission for this point in time for us to sit down and have some talk over the ordinance to see if we can create an ordinance that actually works in this community.

2856
04:15:19,689 --> 04:15:22,553
When you look at the historic commission and you ask how many houses have been saved.

2857
04:15:23,113 --> 04:15:34,295
through the demolition delay process over the past 20 years, I think the answer is one, 22 Turoev, and that was done with a deed of restriction with the buyer prior to the purchase of the home.

2858
04:15:34,355 --> 04:15:36,716
So ultimately, we have an ordinance that's a place that doesn't work.

2859
04:15:37,516 --> 04:15:46,597
It's morphed itself into more of a design review board, and I don't think that it's really meeting the objections in the legislative intent that has been outlined in the ordinance when it was passed.

2860
04:15:47,337 --> 04:15:49,938
So with that being said, Madam President, in an effort to

2861
04:15:50,735 --> 04:15:54,578
provide the city with the ability to receive the matching grant.

2862
04:15:55,199 --> 04:16:02,985
If I can get a commitment from my colleagues to move forward and have a Committee of the Whole on this issue to review the ordinance, I'd be happy to no longer further introduce that measure.

2863
04:16:03,285 --> 04:16:04,566
Would you like that in the form of a motion?

2864
04:16:04,646 --> 04:16:05,146
I sure would.

2865
04:16:05,266 --> 04:16:11,992
I would move that we hold the Committee of the Whole to discuss revisions to the Historic Commission Ordinance.

2866
04:16:13,053 --> 04:16:17,896
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice-Chair Behrs,

2867
04:16:18,745 --> 04:16:19,525
All those in favor?

2868
04:16:19,685 --> 04:16:19,785
Aye.

2869
04:16:19,945 --> 04:16:20,986
All those opposed?

2870
04:16:21,006 --> 04:16:21,746
Motion passes.

2871
04:16:23,467 --> 04:16:24,107
Councilor Collins.

2872
04:16:27,548 --> 04:16:28,668
Thank you, President Morrell.

2873
04:16:28,688 --> 04:16:35,711
Now that we've come to this part of the budget meeting, I want to say I know I've been a little on the quiet side this meeting.

2874
04:16:35,751 --> 04:16:46,074
It's because I think that most of the important points have been made by my fellow councilors and by department heads and by residents who have spoken here in person and on Zoom.

2875
04:16:48,578 --> 04:16:51,819
And I concur with so much that has been said.

2876
04:16:52,139 --> 04:17:10,625
And, you know, I think that this is a moment where, as Vice President Paris just said, this is our last chance to advocate for our council priorities, which are the priorities that we hear from our constituents.

2877
04:17:12,711 --> 04:17:40,147
So with that said, you know, it's my hope, you know, with the cut to KP law, with other cuts on the table, it's my hope that the mayor will return if, depending on how the budget vote goes tonight, that we can return to an amended budget proposal that maintains all existing funding for all of our critical municipal departments, pending meaningful negotiation with the city council about the council's

2878
04:17:40,842 --> 04:17:44,346
priorities as it was said there are several we've been clear about them.

2879
04:17:44,366 --> 04:17:54,817
We we didn't see those listen to responded to in the budget that was noticed and given to us for consideration tonight.

2880
04:17:56,411 --> 04:18:18,223
And I do want to say, while I really appreciate the proposals that the mayor floated earlier this evening, I hope that she could empathize with the feeling that I cannot in good faith reconsider my feelings on a $200 million budget in light of proposals that are being raised at the 11th hour.

2881
04:18:20,548 --> 04:18:28,571
So to that end, I feel that I need a guarantee that our council priorities will be revisited and taken seriously.

2882
04:18:29,232 --> 04:18:35,595
And so with no joy at all, I want to turn to line item executive full-time salary.

2883
04:18:35,635 --> 04:18:37,916
That's line item 0101025110, and suggest a cut of $202,887.

2884
04:18:49,640 --> 04:18:50,361
or 202-887.

2885
04:18:51,421 --> 04:18:59,263
I know that this funding is in the budget because it's critically important, but I want to get across in no uncertain terms that there are other critically important needs that are not in this budget.

2886
04:18:59,943 --> 04:19:00,923
There must be room for both.

2887
04:19:01,703 --> 04:19:05,884
I wouldn't make the suggestion if I didn't know that there is room for both.

2888
04:19:08,405 --> 04:19:17,607
And frankly, I don't accept the paradigm that there aren't options to make room for our council priorities, which are the community's priorities,

2889
04:19:18,892 --> 04:19:22,834
and all of the departmental needs that are already in this budget.

2890
04:19:22,854 --> 04:19:25,255
So that's my motion to cut line item 0101025110 by $202,887.

2891
04:19:25,315 --> 04:19:27,716
And what line was that for?

2892
04:19:27,736 --> 04:19:28,316
For the executive.

2893
04:19:28,416 --> 04:19:28,916
It's on page 75.

2894
04:19:51,915 --> 04:20:01,343
.

2895
04:19:54,978 --> 04:20:01,343
That is $202,887 is the amount you are suggesting.

2896
04:20:01,363 --> 04:20:02,444
Just a question for

2897
04:20:21,875 --> 04:20:29,262
Is it, is my understanding correct that that would cut $202,000 from the mayor's office staff salary line item?

2898
04:20:32,145 --> 04:20:46,498
That is correct and it's my hope that this would galvanize a process of negotiation with the city council that would also include expediting returning those monies to an amended budget proposal that also includes more city council priorities.

2899
04:20:49,010 --> 04:20:52,252
and President Morrell through you to Councilor Collins.

2900
04:20:53,673 --> 04:21:04,420
Could you please, for the sake of tonight's discussion, since you have it before you, I apologize for asking you this, but because I have it in my bag, I just don't wanna miss the opportunity to speak on this issue.

2901
04:21:04,861 --> 04:21:09,304
Could you please recite the amount that is presently in that line proposed?

2902
04:21:10,584 --> 04:21:14,147
I believe the proposed amount for fiscal year 23 is $458,185.

2903
04:21:19,764 --> 04:21:29,230
and President Morrell, if Councilor Collins would be so willing to answer this final question of mine, where does the $202,000 amount come from?

2904
04:21:31,211 --> 04:21:36,614
That comes from a proportion of aggregated salaries within that department.

2905
04:21:36,814 --> 04:21:44,979
And again, I just wanna emphasize, it's not my intention that this money should actually disappear in the fiscal year 23 budget.

2906
04:21:45,599 --> 04:21:48,201
As I said, I feel that I need

2907
04:21:49,757 --> 04:22:00,934
some sort of guarantee that City Council's priorities will be meaningfully answered, answered in earnest, responded to in a potential amended budget.

2908
04:22:01,594 --> 04:22:02,014
proposal.

2909
04:22:02,715 --> 04:22:05,498
And I want to reiterate, it's not about individuals.

2910
04:22:05,558 --> 04:22:06,438
It's not about positions.

2911
04:22:08,440 --> 04:22:14,345
It's my firm conviction that we have space to add these positions back and add back our City Council priorities.

2912
04:22:14,846 --> 04:22:27,017
And I wouldn't put forth this proposal, I know it's a controversial one, if I didn't think that this City Council would swiftly approve a supplemental appropriation pending negotiation on our other priorities.

2913
04:22:29,148 --> 04:22:30,009
Thank you, Madam President.

2914
04:22:30,149 --> 04:22:36,693
And so I'd just like at this point to recite the staff positions that are in the mayor's office that are covered by that budget.

2915
04:22:37,174 --> 04:22:41,197
Again, I appreciate that detail because I genuinely didn't have it in front of me.

2916
04:22:42,057 --> 04:22:54,806
But there is obviously, excluding myself from that conversation, we have a communications team that is critical to this organization in terms of externally.

2917
04:22:56,472 --> 04:22:59,734
stating information that's going on within this organization.

2918
04:23:00,314 --> 04:23:22,686
We have a Director of Community Affairs in that budget who works very hard within the community to further community matters and does a number of different events, is working very closely in conjunction with the Director of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, who has been recently hired, as you all know, an executive assistant in that office as well.

2919
04:23:22,986 --> 04:23:23,306
Thank you.

2920
04:23:24,047 --> 04:23:24,287
Thank you.

2921
04:23:26,637 --> 04:23:27,757
Any further discussion from the council?

2922
04:23:27,777 --> 04:23:30,038
Can I address for the record, please?

2923
04:23:30,338 --> 04:23:34,559
Harold McGilvey for Piedmont Road, Medford.

2924
04:23:34,940 --> 04:23:36,160
$202,000 cut just cut jobs.

2925
04:23:36,180 --> 04:23:38,361
Am I correct to understand that through the chair?

2926
04:23:39,041 --> 04:23:39,381
I'm sorry?

2927
04:23:40,061 --> 04:23:41,842
That cut just cut jobs.

2928
04:23:41,922 --> 04:23:43,562
People won't have jobs, correct?

2929
04:23:43,862 --> 04:23:44,502
That's not true.

2930
04:23:45,543 --> 04:23:47,503
Okay, what was it then?

2931
04:23:47,683 --> 04:23:48,163
The staff.

2932
04:23:48,244 --> 04:23:50,444
More than half of their budget will still be there, so.

2933
04:23:50,464 --> 04:23:52,985
Oh, so they'll have jobs until the money runs out.

2934
04:23:53,310 --> 04:23:59,771
Well, as we said, we expect to prompt a supplemental appropriation by this mayor to meet the needs of this community.

2935
04:23:59,791 --> 04:24:00,111
Okay.

2936
04:24:00,691 --> 04:24:04,052
I've been witness to many budget hearings over the years.

2937
04:24:05,132 --> 04:24:07,393
This by far is not the worst budget I've ever seen.

2938
04:24:07,433 --> 04:24:10,453
We've had far worse budgets in the 2000s.

2939
04:24:10,873 --> 04:24:11,313
You know that.

2940
04:24:11,933 --> 04:24:13,174
Councilor Scott Pele knows that.

2941
04:24:13,554 --> 04:24:14,734
Councilor Cabrera knows that.

2942
04:24:15,114 --> 04:24:16,814
What's going on here is political theater.

2943
04:24:17,334 --> 04:24:20,155
There's an agenda and you're holding a city budget hostage.

2944
04:24:21,535 --> 04:24:24,798
pass the budget and do the work of the people that you voted to do.

2945
04:24:25,178 --> 04:24:25,518
Thank you.

2946
04:24:28,961 --> 04:24:30,162
Any further discussion from the council?

2947
04:24:31,443 --> 04:24:33,324
Do I have a second on Councilor Collins' motion?

2948
04:24:35,326 --> 04:24:35,987
Councilor Kerr-Beall.

2949
04:24:38,008 --> 04:24:40,630
Maybe that $200,000 number might be a little excessive.

2950
04:24:41,671 --> 04:24:45,054
I think maybe we could look at maybe a reduced number.

2951
04:24:45,855 --> 04:24:48,357
As I said, that does,

2952
04:24:49,712 --> 04:24:57,878
It does severely damage the office in this that doesn't change anything if it gets back to us before January.

2953
04:24:57,898 --> 04:25:03,661
Any further discussion from the council?

2954
04:25:05,403 --> 04:25:07,924
We have some members of the public on Zoom who would like to speak.

2955
04:25:07,944 --> 04:25:11,647
Mayor Gaglio, name and address for the record, please.

2956
04:25:18,461 --> 04:25:20,282
Hi, Bill Giglio, Winthrop Street.

2957
04:25:21,142 --> 04:25:24,283
I think pretty much what I just witnessed there is extortion.

2958
04:25:24,624 --> 04:25:26,785
That's nothing less, nothing more.

2959
04:25:27,305 --> 04:25:28,025
That's it.

2960
04:25:28,245 --> 04:25:29,206
You guys should be embarrassed.

2961
04:25:29,446 --> 04:25:29,746
Thank you.

2962
04:25:29,766 --> 04:25:33,507
Audrey, name and address for the record, please.

2963
04:25:37,209 --> 04:25:37,449
Hello?

2964
04:25:39,610 --> 04:25:40,950
Audrey, name and address for the record, please.

2965
04:25:41,651 --> 04:25:45,612
Audrey Sator, 489 Winthrop Street, Medford Mass, Medford High School.

2966
04:25:48,185 --> 04:25:50,587
I'm a 23 year teacher at Medford High School.

2967
04:25:50,667 --> 04:26:01,455
And I just want to say that it's what's embarrassing to me is that people are now in an outrage of you guys wanting to cut a budget elsewhere when it's constantly cut on the backs of the teachers.

2968
04:26:02,817 --> 04:26:03,217
So like,

2969
04:26:06,645 --> 04:26:07,486
It's ridiculous.

2970
04:26:07,686 --> 04:26:24,398
So I appreciate all of the comments about the support of the teachers, not the charter comments, but it's ridiculous that the people are upset about this when no one's upset about us cutting positions of the teachers at Metro Public Schools.

2971
04:26:24,618 --> 04:26:24,958
Thank you.

2972
04:26:25,939 --> 04:26:26,279
Thank you.

2973
04:26:28,120 --> 04:26:31,763
So on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Collins.

2974
04:26:32,961 --> 04:26:33,582
Thank you, President Moran.

2975
04:26:33,602 --> 04:26:39,991
Before I take the vote, I just wanted to say to Councillor Caravaglio, I'm happy to review a friendly amendment if you had a different number in mind.

2976
04:26:40,932 --> 04:26:44,837
It's the spirit of the cut that I really feel strongly about keeping on the floor.

2977
04:26:49,343 --> 04:26:57,769
Though I do want to just reiterate again that it would be my full earnest conviction to approve a supplemental appropriation as soon as it came to us.

2978
04:26:58,230 --> 04:27:02,933
And this, I just, to be clear procedurally was not, would not delete any positions.

2979
04:27:03,013 --> 04:27:09,378
It would just reduce the amount set aside in that line item until a supplemental appropriation.

2980
04:27:10,299 --> 04:27:12,360
Just to make that clear and I'm happy to hear your feedback.

2981
04:27:13,201 --> 04:27:14,662
I second the motion to move the question.

2982
04:27:16,163 --> 04:27:16,764
Do we, well,

2983
04:27:21,094 --> 04:27:22,816
So which line I need to cut them out?

2984
04:27:22,996 --> 04:27:32,264
So we're cutting out, you wanna cut out executive salary, correct?

2985
04:27:32,464 --> 04:27:32,264
458.

2986
04:27:34,105 --> 04:27:36,888
Okay, so 255.

2987
04:27:37,368 --> 04:27:39,270
Do we have the authority to cut their pay?

2988
04:27:39,610 --> 04:27:39,930
Yes.

2989
04:27:44,054 --> 04:27:45,515
I second the motion and move the question.

2990
04:27:49,877 --> 04:27:54,199
So on a motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Vice-Chair Ferris, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2991
04:27:56,641 --> 04:27:57,001
Yes.

2992
04:28:00,122 --> 04:28:02,604
No.

2993
04:28:03,064 --> 04:28:03,284
Yes.

2994
04:28:09,728 --> 04:28:12,049
Yes.

2995
04:28:12,269 --> 04:28:12,469
No.

2996
04:28:13,750 --> 04:28:15,891
Four in the affirmative, three in the negative, the motion passes.

2997
04:28:22,307 --> 04:28:22,868
moving forward.

2998
04:28:22,888 --> 04:28:34,634
I think just when I just caution the council, I can understand we're looking at a line that doesn't reflect people that are in this building right now.

2999
04:28:34,915 --> 04:28:40,078
And I know we're looking at a supplemental budget, but no one knows what direction the administration going.

3000
04:28:40,118 --> 04:28:42,739
So I would caution us moving forward.

3001
04:28:45,348 --> 04:28:46,829
the real people that work in the building.

3002
04:28:46,869 --> 04:28:51,411
We really, I just want to think a little bit deeper with that.

3003
04:28:51,471 --> 04:29:05,938
I should have said something earlier, but the question was moved, but there is, I will support movement when it doesn't have to affect a person that's working in our building every day.

3004
04:29:05,958 --> 04:29:06,919
So thank you.

3005
04:29:07,479 --> 04:29:08,320
Thank you, Mr. Carpelli.

3006
04:29:09,480 --> 04:29:14,463
Madam President, I'd like to make a number of recommendations to the mayor for increases to the fiscal 2023 budget.

3007
04:29:16,528 --> 04:29:32,393
My first motion would be to restore as many of the reductions made to the fiscal 23 budget request after June 2nd, 2022 as possible, as well as to provide additional funding to the Medford Public Schools for educators and staff.

3008
04:29:36,995 --> 04:29:37,795
That's all one motion?

3009
04:29:37,995 --> 04:29:38,195
Yep.

3010
04:29:39,216 --> 04:29:39,936
Do you have it, Mr. Clerk?

3011
04:29:53,264 --> 04:29:54,244
Could you please read that back to me?

3012
04:30:01,548 --> 04:30:10,271
Motion is to restore as many reductions made after June 2nd as possible and provide additional funding to the Metropolitan Public Schools for educators and staff.

3013
04:30:10,531 --> 04:30:10,792
Correct.

3014
04:30:10,832 --> 04:30:12,832
I have a second on that motion.

3015
04:30:12,993 --> 04:30:13,933
Second by Councilor Sang.

3016
04:30:14,753 --> 04:30:15,554
All those in favor?

3017
04:30:15,574 --> 04:30:16,294
Aye.

3018
04:30:16,374 --> 04:30:17,314
All those opposed?

3019
04:30:17,655 --> 04:30:18,335
Motion passes.

3020
04:30:18,755 --> 04:30:22,297
I also have some more specific requests I could make as a package.

3021
04:30:23,983 --> 04:30:29,528
Request an increase to the law department salaries line item by $85,000.

3022
04:30:32,090 --> 04:30:37,555
Request an increase to the legislative professional technical services line item by $50,000.

3023
04:30:58,040 --> 04:30:58,860
Let me read back what I have.

3024
04:30:59,401 --> 04:31:04,003
First one is to request an increase of $85,000 in law department salaries.

3025
04:31:04,463 --> 04:31:04,684
Yes.

3026
04:31:04,924 --> 04:31:08,446
Second is to request an increase in the legislative professional services budget by $50,000.

3027
04:31:08,506 --> 04:31:08,726
Correct.

3028
04:31:08,766 --> 04:31:10,227
Third is to request an increase to the library of $150,000.

3029
04:31:10,307 --> 04:31:12,148
Okay, got it.

3030
04:31:12,168 --> 04:31:14,469
And last is to request an increase to the elections department of $15,000.

3031
04:31:37,449 --> 04:31:38,470
1, 1, 5, 0, for the library and 1, 1, 5,004 correct.

3032
04:31:38,490 --> 04:31:40,352
150,000 for the library and 15,000 for the elections department.

3033
04:31:40,492 --> 04:31:41,973
Do I have a second for that motion?

3034
04:31:51,092 --> 04:31:52,032
Second by Councilor Collins.

3035
04:31:52,052 --> 04:31:55,513
Mr. Clerk, will you please read back that motion for me?

3036
04:31:55,873 --> 04:31:56,773
Yes, four parts.

3037
04:31:57,393 --> 04:32:01,334
To request an increase of $85,000 to law department salaries.

3038
04:32:02,014 --> 04:32:05,275
Second, to request an increase in legislative professional services by $50,000.

3039
04:32:06,935 --> 04:32:08,876
Third, to request an increase to the library of $150,000.

3040
04:32:08,916 --> 04:32:12,857
Fourth, to request an increase to the elections department by $15,000.

3041
04:32:14,264 --> 04:32:34,840
Yes, and I'm just going to add that my intention with these recommendations is once again, with the hope that we will have a negotiation on an amendment or supplemental appropriation to the fiscal 23 budget that allows us to address the priorities and needs of this community, as well as address the impact of cuts made tonight.

3042
04:32:35,120 --> 04:32:35,420
Thank you.

3043
04:32:39,784 --> 04:32:40,485
Thank you, Madam President.

3044
04:32:40,525 --> 04:32:48,530
Councilor Beas, to the Chair and Councilor Beas, does that include the $60,000 that the Mayor has already promised for the library?

3045
04:32:48,550 --> 04:32:49,830
Well, I don't know that it's a promise.

3046
04:32:49,870 --> 04:32:52,132
We don't get it verbally.

3047
04:32:52,152 --> 04:32:53,853
She made a commitment to 60 of them tonight.

3048
04:32:54,133 --> 04:32:56,355
And I think it should be 150 and maybe we can meet in the middle.

3049
04:32:56,555 --> 04:32:59,917
If you want to reduce the amount, less than $60,000 that she's already committed.

3050
04:33:00,417 --> 04:33:04,380
Well, it's not committed in any budget before us or any amendment before us.

3051
04:33:04,440 --> 04:33:06,001
So, you know, my point is that

3052
04:33:06,661 --> 04:33:10,183
What we heard from the library, the budget hearing is that really what we need is a 150,000.

3053
04:33:10,303 --> 04:33:11,684
I agree with you.

3054
04:33:11,704 --> 04:33:18,689
The mayor did say, if I understood right, that she committed another 60.

3055
04:33:19,609 --> 04:33:19,789
Right.

3056
04:33:19,849 --> 04:33:24,232
So if that's true, then that could be improved.

3057
04:33:25,032 --> 04:33:27,694
Is that what the mayor said?

3058
04:33:28,054 --> 04:33:28,955
President Morrell, through you.

3059
04:33:29,792 --> 04:33:40,119
Yes, confirming that the mayor did indicate that she would recommend to, because the statutes that pertain to the budget require that the mayor make the recommendation.

3060
04:33:41,100 --> 04:33:56,690
By her making that recommendation this evening, essentially, the city council can vote to move $60,000 from the executive salaries negotiated budget to the library.

3061
04:33:57,268 --> 04:33:59,269
That is exactly what that transaction would allow.

3062
04:33:59,849 --> 04:34:13,993
And I would also add to this that the potential cuts that are being discussed here, I just wanna speak mechanically about what is likely gonna be the scenario that will unfold.

3063
04:34:15,494 --> 04:34:21,216
Once June 30th passes, free cash is no longer available until it's certified again.

3064
04:34:22,176 --> 04:34:24,937
So even if there was to be some,

3065
04:34:25,788 --> 04:34:31,414
discussion on a supplemental budget, it would be restricted to the amounts that are no longer there.

3066
04:34:32,235 --> 04:34:36,559
There's not going to be an availability of additional funds somehow at that point in time.

3067
04:34:37,280 --> 04:34:40,824
So I just want to caution the Council, and I hope you all understand,

3068
04:34:42,042 --> 04:34:46,787
that there's not going to be funds until fiscal 22 is closed.

3069
04:34:47,168 --> 04:34:49,490
And that usually happens in the fall.

3070
04:34:49,851 --> 04:34:56,638
And if it happens in the fall, that's usually when we've had, you know, good staff, reconciliations going back.

3071
04:34:58,300 --> 04:35:03,122
over the course of the last years in a consistent manner, that hasn't been the case.

3072
04:35:03,802 --> 04:35:05,203
So we are behind.

3073
04:35:05,643 --> 04:35:08,605
We are certainly shooting for the fall to have free cash certified.

3074
04:35:08,905 --> 04:35:13,467
But I just want to make sure that you all understand the ramifications of your discussions.

3075
04:35:13,507 --> 04:35:20,830
And I would also defer to our finance director, Bob Dickinson, or our consultant, Sean McGuldrick,

3076
04:35:22,367 --> 04:35:29,980
There's any further comments on the availability of funds and the point that I'm making if they have any disagreements or otherwise further information to add.

3077
04:35:30,627 --> 04:35:45,471
I would reduce my motion to 90,000 for the library from 150,000, and I would make a further motion to accept the mayor's recommendation to transfer 60,000 from the negotiated salaries line item to the library.

3078
04:35:46,651 --> 04:35:53,293
Madam President, I as one member of this body support increasing the funding to the library, but I don't support taking out of the negotiated salaries line item.

3079
04:35:53,873 --> 04:35:59,315
That's the money that's been set aside to pay the cost of living adjustments for the people that came up here and told us their story this evening.

3080
04:35:59,627 --> 04:36:01,028
I withdraw my further motion.

3081
04:36:01,708 --> 04:36:06,551
So I just don't feel comfortable taking him out of that account, because all we're doing is robbing Peter to pay Paul.

3082
04:36:06,892 --> 04:36:08,313
We have a problem over here and a problem over here.

3083
04:36:08,333 --> 04:36:11,254
We're going to take it from over here and put it over here, and then we'll deal with that problem later.

3084
04:36:12,715 --> 04:36:13,956
I don't think that makes good sense.

3085
04:36:14,016 --> 04:36:16,578
I think it makes political sense, but I don't think it makes good fiscal sense.

3086
04:36:16,598 --> 04:36:19,280
Any further discussion?

3087
04:36:24,631 --> 04:36:34,476
The motion, Vice President Behr, seconded by Councilor Sviggum, Councilor Collins, Councilor Sviggum.

3088
04:36:34,576 --> 04:36:35,837
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3089
04:36:38,058 --> 04:36:41,200
This is on the motion as amended to 90,000 for the library.

3090
04:36:41,880 --> 04:36:42,320
As amended.

3091
04:36:43,041 --> 04:36:44,221
If you could read it back, Mr. Clerk.

3092
04:36:44,461 --> 04:36:47,183
But you're withdrawing the motion to transfer?

3093
04:36:47,403 --> 04:36:49,024
Correct, I've withdrawn the motion to transfer.

3094
04:36:49,144 --> 04:36:50,625
But you are reducing it to 90,000?

3095
04:36:52,024 --> 04:36:53,565
Sure, I guess we'll see what happens.

3096
04:36:56,127 --> 04:36:57,308
I really wish we weren't in this position.

3097
04:37:01,491 --> 04:37:02,212
Vice President Behrs?

3098
04:37:02,932 --> 04:37:03,152
Yes.

3099
04:37:04,634 --> 04:37:05,174
Councilor Kerrio?

3100
04:37:05,194 --> 04:37:05,294
Yes.

3101
04:37:07,115 --> 04:37:07,716
Councilor Collins?

3102
04:37:07,936 --> 04:37:08,136
Yes.

3103
04:37:09,357 --> 04:37:09,817
Councilor Knight?

3104
04:37:10,078 --> 04:37:10,278
Yes.

3105
04:37:11,198 --> 04:37:11,939
Councilor Scarpelli?

3106
04:37:12,119 --> 04:37:12,319
No.

3107
04:37:14,841 --> 04:37:15,382
Councilor Singh?

3108
04:37:15,522 --> 04:37:15,722
Yes.

3109
04:37:16,442 --> 04:37:16,983
President Morrell?

3110
04:37:17,283 --> 04:37:17,503
Yes.

3111
04:37:17,703 --> 04:37:19,725
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

3112
04:37:22,628 --> 04:37:25,330
Any further discussion or motions from the council at this point?

3113
04:37:27,271 --> 04:37:28,652
Mr. Murphy, if you'd like to come back.

3114
04:37:28,672 --> 04:37:38,678
There you go.

3115
04:37:38,758 --> 04:37:39,659
Thank you, President Morrell.

3116
04:37:40,662 --> 04:38:05,701
The superintendent and I wanted to, one, express our gratitude on behalf of the school administration and all of the Medford Public Schools for the depth of the analysis and the zealousness of the advocacy that members of this council, as well as members of the community and members of our Medford Public Schools community have exhibited throughout this budget process.

3117
04:38:07,422 --> 04:38:16,686
I know that many of you followed the budget process that the school district worked through with the Medford School Committee over the course of the past two months.

3118
04:38:17,426 --> 04:38:26,950
And I know that you're familiar with the school committee's original recommendation that, of course, was in excess of the number that's been recommended before you this evening.

3119
04:38:27,070 --> 04:38:31,592
And we also understand that while our process plays out in a very public forum,

3120
04:38:32,532 --> 04:38:36,377
that that is the case for every department head throughout the course of the city.

3121
04:38:36,637 --> 04:38:45,106
And there have been, I think, I hope it goes without saying that there have been a tremendous number of very valid and solid points here tonight.

3122
04:38:45,707 --> 04:38:50,652
And a lot of those points, frankly, I think illustrate the extent to which this community values and prioritizes

3123
04:38:51,333 --> 04:39:07,023
public education, and as individuals who work and lead in that space on a daily basis, I hope it's clear how much we appreciate that and how much that means to us as an administrative team and to us as an organization.

3124
04:39:08,524 --> 04:39:15,470
There have been a number of questions tonight, particularly during the public comment period that's spoken about the scope of the question that's before you.

3125
04:39:15,910 --> 04:39:32,825
And frankly, the scope of the question that we deal with this frequently where the scope of the questions that are before us as a district leadership team are not frankly about some of those questions that only you as community members can answer with respect to some of the decisions that may or may not be ahead of you in the months or years ahead.

3126
04:39:34,030 --> 04:39:42,372
The question that we have to face every day is how do we run the district in a way that is stable and that is done in the best interest of students.

3127
04:39:43,032 --> 04:39:52,575
And right now there are a number of variables that, as I discussed with you last week and we talked a little bit about tonight, that have led us to have to make a series of difficult decisions.

3128
04:39:53,095 --> 04:40:05,659
And we have frankly not posited those decisions before you in a way that has tried to hold this budget or this budgeting process hostage to the decisions that we as an administration have to make on a regular basis.

3129
04:40:06,279 --> 04:40:17,883
But the reality is with uncertainty, the uncertainty that exists makes it very difficult for us to make responsible decisions on behalf of this community and on behalf of the Medford Public Schools.

3130
04:40:18,643 --> 04:40:33,916
And the certainty and the stability that you can provide by proving this budget, which incidentally as the mayor mentioned has increased by $300,000 which is certainly a modest amount, but it's something that we have a responsibility to make sure every penny of is spent wisely, and on behalf of students.

3131
04:40:34,597 --> 04:40:37,698
And so we're moving in the direction that we need to go in.

3132
04:40:38,038 --> 04:40:51,981
And I am very confident that the advocacy by this council by the Medford school committee and by the by the faculty members that spoken by the community members who spoke will continue after whatever budget is adopted is adopted.

3133
04:40:52,501 --> 04:40:55,862
But right now with the Medford public schools need is stability and

3134
04:40:56,442 --> 04:41:07,312
And the way in which you can help us to instill that is by approving the budget that's before you at approximately $69.3 million, and we're grateful to you for your time.

3135
04:41:07,912 --> 04:41:08,252
Thank you.

3136
04:41:09,193 --> 04:41:10,014
Thank you, Madam Superintendent.

3137
04:41:10,474 --> 04:41:17,040
Yes, I just want to say, Madam President, and to the Council, thank you again for your support of the Medford Public Schools.

3138
04:41:17,700 --> 04:41:19,562
I also want to thank the Medford School Committee.

3139
04:41:20,608 --> 04:41:27,410
And all the teachers who spoke today and really shared their personal stories, we are listening.

3140
04:41:27,770 --> 04:41:39,373
We know that this is a very difficult decision, but again, we ask that you humbly accept the request that has gone before you so we can begin to make changes on the school side.

3141
04:41:39,653 --> 04:41:39,973
Thank you.

3142
04:41:49,083 --> 04:41:52,584
If I may, I'd like to amplify those comments.

3143
04:41:56,646 --> 04:42:11,251
I get very nervous about, I get very nervous about talking about kicking the can down the road for 45 days and having the budget just roll that way.

3144
04:42:11,531 --> 04:42:14,952
There's a lot of operational things that would have to be done.

3145
04:42:14,972 --> 04:42:16,113
We would have to get

3146
04:42:17,880 --> 04:42:23,383
1 12th budget for the council that to be we don't have one of those right now.

3147
04:42:24,503 --> 04:42:29,125
Um, when I first came before this council, I talked about kicking the can down the road.

3148
04:42:30,526 --> 04:42:34,167
In terms of having a structural deficit and how we had to address that.

3149
04:42:35,188 --> 04:42:45,272
I want to get I would really urge that we we get this budget passed so we can actually have stability and

3150
04:42:46,357 --> 04:42:48,957
start addressing all these concerns.

3151
04:42:51,558 --> 04:43:03,300
Also, structurally, when I think about making changes to the budget, what goes through my mind as an accountant is, okay, free cash expires as of June 30th.

3152
04:43:05,740 --> 04:43:09,181
I gotta do a recap in November.

3153
04:43:11,641 --> 04:43:13,442
These numbers flow into the recap.

3154
04:43:14,062 --> 04:43:15,822
Once the recap is set, we can't

3155
04:43:17,508 --> 04:43:26,454
after November, once we've set the recap, we can't go and add something to it, like we tried with that budget.

3156
04:43:26,614 --> 04:43:38,723
That's why we're re-voting the $55,000 law budget, because last winter, it was voted to be paid for by tax revenue.

3157
04:43:38,943 --> 04:43:42,886
Well, you can't do that after the tax recap has been done.

3158
04:43:44,307 --> 04:43:44,467
So,

3159
04:43:46,926 --> 04:43:52,348
For me, there's a lot of operational stuff that would have to happen if we don't approve this budget tonight.

3160
04:43:53,649 --> 04:43:56,450
And that makes me nervous.

3161
04:43:57,290 --> 04:44:05,273
I'm not expressing myself very well, but I thought I'd just come up and say that.

3162
04:44:06,153 --> 04:44:07,214
I want to get this done.

3163
04:44:07,234 --> 04:44:12,596
I want to get this done so we can put it into the system.

3164
04:44:12,616 --> 04:44:15,277
We can start working on cleanup 2022.

3165
04:44:17,384 --> 04:44:19,965
and getting the whole process back online again.

3166
04:44:20,705 --> 04:44:23,906
So that's.

3167
04:44:27,707 --> 04:44:33,689
So again, I'm going to reiterate the same thing I said earlier, and this isn't a gotcha game or anything like that.

3168
04:44:33,769 --> 04:44:34,729
I just want you to realize

3169
04:44:36,702 --> 04:44:42,804
As nervous as everybody seems to come to this podium right now, this is how we've been feeling.

3170
04:44:43,365 --> 04:44:55,609
Do you people understand that when we ask for revenue, we ask for reports, when we ask for something and we don't get it, do you realize that we go and we have to answer to people?

3171
04:44:55,629 --> 04:44:59,150
And this is difficult, this is very difficult.

3172
04:44:59,750 --> 04:45:03,732
And maybe two wrongs don't make a right, but I'm gonna tell you, I had non-negotiables.

3173
04:45:04,717 --> 04:45:08,901
And I was voted by my constituents that said, this is what I put George in there for.

3174
04:45:08,921 --> 04:45:20,971
And I'm telling you, the way that I feel I've been treated on behalf of the people that put me into this position, I can't vote on the budget.

3175
04:45:22,893 --> 04:45:31,040
I asked for simple $50,000 so we have representation here for us, because I don't wanna be put in a position that we have.

3176
04:45:32,462 --> 04:45:37,323
And I can respect our directors coming up and saying how difficult that is.

3177
04:45:37,383 --> 04:45:40,204
I understand that.

3178
04:45:40,244 --> 04:45:42,564
I feel exactly how you feel, because I'm in that seat.

3179
04:45:43,324 --> 04:45:55,907
But as an elected official, we really have one purpose that we have any power on when we don't feel that we've been respected or we're not getting what we need for our constituents.

3180
04:45:57,927 --> 04:46:04,329
You can call it political theater, whatever you want, but the truth of the matter is, this is the only bargaining chip we have.

3181
04:46:05,129 --> 04:46:05,749
This vote.

3182
04:46:09,530 --> 04:46:11,471
And it pains me that we have to go through this.

3183
04:46:12,952 --> 04:46:15,192
But I cannot support this budget.

3184
04:46:15,452 --> 04:46:17,433
This whole process has been a mess.

3185
04:46:19,894 --> 04:46:20,634
It's been a mess.

3186
04:46:21,354 --> 04:46:23,895
And you can blame every other angle, whatever you want,

3187
04:46:25,115 --> 04:46:29,956
But not to have a dialogue with us has to pay a dividend, it has to pay a price.

3188
04:46:29,996 --> 04:46:36,897
And that's why I feel comfortable in understanding that, well, I'm willing to roll the dice and vote no on this budget.

3189
04:46:36,917 --> 04:46:42,398
Because I'm not happy.

3190
04:46:44,258 --> 04:46:46,019
Apologize for that, Madam President.

3191
04:46:54,909 --> 04:46:55,709
I understand that.

3192
04:46:55,730 --> 04:46:58,491
I have to say, I do understand that.

3193
04:46:59,452 --> 04:47:07,216
I'm simply speaking from the point of view of trying to keep the bills paid, trying to keep the lights on.

3194
04:47:08,416 --> 04:47:13,959
That's been done for the last year by hook and crook, basically.

3195
04:47:14,280 --> 04:47:17,141
There's a lot of things that have fallen by the wayside because of that.

3196
04:47:17,321 --> 04:47:20,323
That's just from my point of view, I want

3197
04:47:22,493 --> 04:47:26,934
I want to be able to get to do the actual dirty work of my job.

3198
04:47:28,014 --> 04:47:41,477
So I thought I'd bring that up just to tell you what kind of the nuts and bolts of what I would have to do if this budget is not passed.

3199
04:47:44,858 --> 04:47:50,979
Kicking the can down the road would end up slowing everything down for the next year.

3200
04:47:52,440 --> 04:48:00,522
because my staff, myself and my staff would have to be putting together a 112th budget and dealing with the 112th budget going forward.

3201
04:48:00,542 --> 04:48:06,583
Then we'd have to worry about how it's all presented on the recap, when we can get free cash certified.

3202
04:48:07,183 --> 04:48:09,123
Those are the nuts and bolts of what I'd have to do.

3203
04:48:09,703 --> 04:48:12,224
So that's why I'm nervous about this.

3204
04:48:12,284 --> 04:48:20,466
And I understand this certainly wasn't something that I wanted to jump into on my first few weeks on the job.

3205
04:48:22,906 --> 04:48:26,608
That's where, that's basically my position on this right now.

3206
04:48:27,449 --> 04:48:27,749
Thank you.

3207
04:48:28,749 --> 04:48:29,350
Councilor Carvajal.

3208
04:48:29,870 --> 04:48:30,630
Thank you, Madam President.

3209
04:48:32,652 --> 04:48:33,532
Bob, no one's blaming you.

3210
04:48:33,592 --> 04:48:39,996
It's not your fault or anything here, but I share Councilor Scott's anger in this.

3211
04:48:41,837 --> 04:48:43,318
This, again, this is my 11th budget.

3212
04:48:43,598 --> 04:48:46,600
I've never, we've never gone down to this, to the last one.

3213
04:48:46,860 --> 04:48:49,561
This is a discussion that we should have been having a week or two ago.

3214
04:48:52,036 --> 04:48:59,780
So we're not at this point, even months ago, so we're not at this point where we are at the last day.

3215
04:49:02,562 --> 04:49:14,948
We've had plenty of time, and in all fairness to the president, it wasn't fair to her for the process that she's had to go through in her first term as a president.

3216
04:49:17,001 --> 04:49:27,507
This is something that should have been done weeks and weeks ago, not at the last hour, to give ourselves room to discuss.

3217
04:49:28,428 --> 04:49:31,390
So the time to discuss this has passed.

3218
04:49:32,462 --> 04:49:37,943
It should have already happened and not waiting till the day before the end of the month.

3219
04:49:38,544 --> 04:49:47,026
So again, I feel bad for the president that she's been put in a bad spot on this, for her first budget.

3220
04:49:47,826 --> 04:49:52,808
And again, it hasn't been fair to her on this.

3221
04:49:53,508 --> 04:49:57,269
So again, and Councilor Caput is right.

3222
04:49:57,589 --> 04:49:59,569
This is our only chance at this here.

3223
04:50:00,029 --> 04:50:01,510
And the thing, we answer to the people.

3224
04:50:03,179 --> 04:50:04,860
And these are the questions that they're asking us.

3225
04:50:06,160 --> 04:50:08,662
This is not, we're not grandstanding here.

3226
04:50:09,642 --> 04:50:11,163
There's nothing to grandstand on.

3227
04:50:11,763 --> 04:50:13,924
This isn't easy for us either.

3228
04:50:15,105 --> 04:50:17,806
So again, I'm with Councilor Scott Pelley.

3229
04:50:19,687 --> 04:50:21,728
It's just too little, too late.

3230
04:50:24,009 --> 04:50:24,909
Thank you, Councilor Carviel.

3231
04:50:26,810 --> 04:50:27,990
Any other councilors like to speak?

3232
04:50:30,552 --> 04:50:31,232
This is embarrassing.

3233
04:50:31,737 --> 04:50:32,597
Thank you, Madam President.

3234
04:50:33,818 --> 04:50:34,338
This sucks.

3235
04:50:35,519 --> 04:50:36,359
This really sucks.

3236
04:50:38,600 --> 04:50:40,181
I have been saying it all night.

3237
04:50:40,921 --> 04:50:42,042
I wish we weren't in this position.

3238
04:50:43,882 --> 04:50:46,864
I wish that we had had a budget book early.

3239
04:50:46,924 --> 04:50:48,624
I wish that the budget had been submitted earlier.

3240
04:50:48,684 --> 04:50:51,646
I wish that we had known about the ARPA calculation earlier.

3241
04:50:51,726 --> 04:50:55,207
I wish that we had been part of a collaborative discussion.

3242
04:50:55,227 --> 04:51:00,810
I wish that the recommendations that we delivered six months ago had been considered properly.

3243
04:51:02,534 --> 04:51:04,735
you know, wishing, if only wishing made it so.

3244
04:51:05,955 --> 04:51:06,855
We are where we are now.

3245
04:51:08,256 --> 04:51:09,236
I've been very clear.

3246
04:51:09,856 --> 04:51:11,657
I voted against the fiscal 21 budget.

3247
04:51:11,937 --> 04:51:12,197
Why?

3248
04:51:13,217 --> 04:51:13,978
It cut teachers.

3249
04:51:14,658 --> 04:51:15,478
It cut our schools.

3250
04:51:15,958 --> 04:51:17,039
It wasn't enough for what we needed.

3251
04:51:17,059 --> 04:51:24,861
I voted yes on the fiscal 22 budget because it did enough and it was enough in a tough time.

3252
04:51:26,402 --> 04:51:27,242
I've been very clear.

3253
04:51:27,262 --> 04:51:29,743
I quite frankly think for weeks at this point,

3254
04:51:31,120 --> 04:51:34,621
There are things that need to be in this budget in order to get my support.

3255
04:51:35,081 --> 04:51:37,022
They're not in there, so I can't support it.

3256
04:51:37,222 --> 04:51:38,922
I don't know how much clearer I can get.

3257
04:51:40,283 --> 04:51:42,563
I wish that we weren't here.

3258
04:51:42,583 --> 04:51:49,205
I wish that we had had these discussions weeks and months ago, but it's June 28.

3259
04:51:50,505 --> 04:51:59,388
And once again, whether it's legal counsel's not in the room or we didn't have a finance director or whatever the other reason is,

3260
04:52:01,836 --> 04:52:02,676
That's where we landed.

3261
04:52:03,877 --> 04:52:07,098
We've been asking for months to have our priorities considered.

3262
04:52:07,118 --> 04:52:08,818
We've been asking for months for information.

3263
04:52:09,478 --> 04:52:17,661
We've been asking for at least weeks for the budget book and getting something early and making it clear that the clock was running out.

3264
04:52:18,161 --> 04:52:18,601
Time's out.

3265
04:52:20,201 --> 04:52:20,821
Clock's run out.

3266
04:52:21,582 --> 04:52:22,282
We are where we are.

3267
04:52:24,102 --> 04:52:24,663
And it sucks.

3268
04:52:25,623 --> 04:52:28,904
And I'm sorry that it sucks, but we've done everything we could to avoid it.

3269
04:52:30,070 --> 04:52:35,591
And at the end of the day, the charter and the budget, it's a function of state law.

3270
04:52:36,371 --> 04:52:39,032
Mayor's in charge, mayor submits.

3271
04:52:39,732 --> 04:52:41,512
We can't even really reject the thing.

3272
04:52:42,172 --> 04:52:47,313
All we can do is say we don't like it, and then 45 days later, it goes no effect anyway, with a few cuts that we made.

3273
04:52:48,513 --> 04:52:51,934
So that's the power we have, and that's the situation we're in.

3274
04:52:52,754 --> 04:52:54,254
And that's why I'm not gonna vote for this budget.

3275
04:52:54,475 --> 04:52:54,795
Thank you.

3276
04:52:56,375 --> 04:52:56,975
Councilor Collins.

3277
04:52:59,208 --> 04:53:00,129
Thank you, President Morrell.

3278
04:53:01,269 --> 04:53:07,833
I just wanted to take the opportunity to make a statement on explaining my vote on this budget.

3279
04:53:08,353 --> 04:53:12,195
And before I dive into it, I just wanted to make it really clear.

3280
04:53:13,976 --> 04:53:16,657
My no vote is not personal.

3281
04:53:17,478 --> 04:53:22,901
It is not a referendum on the skill or the integrity of anybody in this administration.

3282
04:53:24,362 --> 04:53:28,284
It's because I see an unambiguous need for a bolder budget.

3283
04:53:29,638 --> 04:53:35,986
and I have to save my support for a bolder budget because I feel that's why I was elected.

3284
04:53:37,167 --> 04:53:44,756
Since before I sought office, I've been feeling alarmed by our city's lack of capacity for vital basic services.

3285
04:53:45,416 --> 04:53:47,919
If I knocked on your door during my campaign last year,

3286
04:53:48,580 --> 04:54:06,388
You probably heard me talk about my aspirations, for example, for the city to start an Office of Housing Stability and Office of Immigrant Outreach, for the city to be a leader in net zero development, invest in local public health resources, grow our tree canopy, fund a fully modernized website and on and on and on.

3287
04:54:06,548 --> 04:54:15,052
And my conviction that it is necessary that we push for more and better and more equitably distributed services in our community is why I'm sitting in this chair today.

3288
04:54:15,613 --> 04:54:16,393
I'm well aware

3289
04:54:16,933 --> 04:54:27,366
that list I just mentioned comprises some pretty ambitious policy goals and I am very, very well aware of the constraints that our city, like all cities, operates under.

3290
04:54:27,926 --> 04:54:34,074
We always have to be realistic about what is achievable in any given term or any fiscal year, but this budget goes far

3291
04:54:35,216 --> 04:54:38,499
below just being realistic and achievable.

3292
04:54:39,199 --> 04:54:45,104
This budget does not, to me, address the bare bones, basic, uncontroversial fundamentals.

3293
04:54:45,965 --> 04:54:47,386
We're not looking up at the ceiling.

3294
04:54:47,746 --> 04:54:48,767
We are looking up at the floor.

3295
04:54:50,781 --> 04:55:11,059
I believe that all of us are painfully aware of just how much we have to build up just to get back to baseline, to recover from the past two and a half years, to repair our roads and sidewalks and municipal infrastructure, to support those who are at risk of getting priced out of this community, to build a more resilient future, to take care of all of our residents the way that they deserve.

3296
04:55:12,138 --> 04:55:25,823
And it is all urgently necessary work it's urgently necessary work that feels to me unacceptably out of reach, because this budget doesn't even address the basics that our community needs and deserves this year right now.

3297
04:55:27,947 --> 04:55:30,868
just to restate some of what's been already put on the record tonight.

3298
04:55:31,728 --> 04:55:39,411
While students, teachers, and education staff are yearning to recover from the trauma and the substantial learning loss of the pandemic, the schools are level funded.

3299
04:55:40,132 --> 04:55:44,733
And in an environment of 8.5% inflation, level funding means less.

3300
04:55:45,353 --> 04:55:49,315
Less support for staff, less staff in the buildings, less support for students.

3301
04:55:50,563 --> 04:55:59,887
We spent years building a beautiful, brilliant new public library, and everybody chipped in, all through their taxes, and many with extra generosity on top.

3302
04:56:00,767 --> 04:56:03,749
And under this budget, we can't fully staff it.

3303
04:56:04,949 --> 04:56:07,210
Again, level funding means less service.

3304
04:56:08,768 --> 04:56:25,471
Thanks to community advocates translation services did occupy a place in the city's operating budget, which brought us closer to the goal of enabling all Metro residents to start to participate in city meetings, be equitable, equitably served by city communications, a goal which is still not really fully realized.

3305
04:56:26,452 --> 04:56:31,416
but in this budget proposal, there wasn't even room for translation services anymore.

3306
04:56:31,476 --> 04:56:37,100
It's been shifted to one-time funding, ARPA, which, as has been stated, expires in December of 2024.

3307
04:56:38,481 --> 04:56:49,610
Something so fundamental as making sure that what comes out of City Call will be receivable and intelligible by all constituents has no place being relegated to one-time funding services.

3308
04:56:51,231 --> 04:56:53,593
Finally, this City Council

3309
04:56:54,137 --> 04:56:59,539
is where residents come to advocate for any number of issues facing the community, from potholes to public safety to public health.

3310
04:57:00,579 --> 04:57:14,603
The channel that we have to respond to those issues with is our power to legislate, to craft ordinances and zoning that reflect our city's wants and needs, to enforce our standards for a safe city and organize for a livable future.

3311
04:57:16,744 --> 04:57:20,925
But with no dedicated legal staff for the council, after many, many requests,

3312
04:57:22,052 --> 04:57:30,899
and our critical phase two of zoning going, you know, without a commitment, we aren't being given the necessary tools to do this job.

3313
04:57:31,660 --> 04:57:41,568
I want to know how to be an effective legislator when we have to join a week's long queue to get a legal opinion on an ordinance, which has been my lived experience in the first six months of my term.

3314
04:57:42,450 --> 04:57:59,026
I want to know how to craft smart and thoughtful zoning reforms that will protect us in the climate change future when we don't have $50,000 for a zoning consultant, which for context is .025% of our current operating budget proposed for next fiscal year.

3315
04:57:59,727 --> 04:58:00,207
These are not

3316
04:58:01,246 --> 04:58:07,049
To me, trivial or petty matters, matters of convenience for me and my fellow councilors.

3317
04:58:07,750 --> 04:58:08,470
It's more important.

3318
04:58:08,510 --> 04:58:18,455
Those hampers are the only channel that this body has to address issues like housing stability, tree canopy, environmental standards, language accessibility, infrastructure safety, and on and on.

3319
04:58:19,356 --> 04:58:22,998
When the city council is denied tools to be effective, the community loses its advocate.

3320
04:58:24,790 --> 04:58:32,617
I know that even under ideal circumstances, we cannot do or even start all that needs to be done in a single year.

3321
04:58:33,398 --> 04:58:42,646
But this administration had told us explicitly that this year, the city is expected to do more with less, and that the plan for next year is to make do with potentially even less than that.

3322
04:58:43,687 --> 04:58:46,989
I cannot condone that plan, and I cannot condone that trajectory.

3323
04:58:47,049 --> 04:58:49,532
The stakes are too high, and the needs are too great.

3324
04:58:50,656 --> 04:58:59,424
I know that because we've been hearing from you and not just about the library and the schools and how hard it is to give our municipal workers the pay and the support that they deserve.

3325
04:59:00,405 --> 04:59:08,773
I hear from you about afterschool and infrastructure and basic constituent services and housing stability resources that you need and we cannot provide.

3326
04:59:10,335 --> 04:59:11,196
I need a commitment.

3327
04:59:12,368 --> 04:59:22,291
that the unassailable values that this administration promotes, like equity, security, sustainability, inclusion, that these are values in practice and not just awards.

3328
04:59:23,231 --> 04:59:25,052
And this budget does not yet make that commitment.

3329
04:59:26,292 --> 04:59:32,974
I desperately wanna see a budget proposal that makes a good faith effort at exemplifying those values that goes further.

3330
04:59:33,955 --> 04:59:41,377
I wanna see a proposal that says, we will move heaven and earth to fund our schools and our community spaces and acknowledges that we cannot afford to defer

3331
04:59:42,448 --> 04:59:48,772
on climate change and represents a real plan for making this community better every year, supporting all Medford residents the way they deserve.

3332
04:59:49,913 --> 04:59:51,134
But I haven't seen that plan yet.

3333
04:59:52,415 --> 04:59:56,077
When I do, and I hope I see it soon, I will vote yes on it.

3334
04:59:56,918 --> 05:00:01,921
And then I will work with my fellow counselors and this administration to make those values manifest in our community.

3335
05:00:02,822 --> 05:00:09,767
Because throughout this term so far, I can confidently say that this council has sought a collaborative approach with this administration.

3336
05:00:12,088 --> 05:00:19,310
But this is a moment where we must insist on reciprocity and collaboration in the service of our critical goals for the community.

3337
05:00:20,850 --> 05:00:24,351
Because what I'm waiting for is what the community is calling out for.

3338
05:00:25,411 --> 05:00:28,852
In sum, this budget, less than we deserve, less than we need.

3339
05:00:28,872 --> 05:00:33,773
I wish that we had the opportunity to negotiate about this, to dive into these questions.

3340
05:00:35,105 --> 05:00:36,426
weeks ago, months ago.

3341
05:00:36,926 --> 05:00:38,347
This is not the process that I wanted.

3342
05:00:39,288 --> 05:00:40,649
This is not the tone that I wanted.

3343
05:00:40,909 --> 05:00:41,810
I don't like any of this.

3344
05:00:43,030 --> 05:00:48,074
But I know that we have options for doing better for next year, but also for fiscal year 23.

3345
05:00:48,714 --> 05:00:50,295
And that's why I can't accept this proposal.

3346
05:00:50,555 --> 05:00:51,976
And that's why I'll be voting no on the budget.

3347
05:00:52,417 --> 05:00:53,377
Thank you for letting me take the time.

3348
05:00:53,397 --> 05:00:56,219
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

3349
05:00:56,439 --> 05:00:59,822
Councilor Svang, I know Councilors have some kind of closing statements.

3350
05:00:59,842 --> 05:01:00,182
It's just

3351
05:01:02,340 --> 05:01:03,141
It's 12, 11 a.m.

3352
05:01:04,062 --> 05:01:08,247
Does Shane get paid for next day now?

3353
05:01:08,287 --> 05:01:09,769
Because he's been here for two days.

3354
05:01:09,969 --> 05:01:12,072
So Shane should definitely get paid twice.

3355
05:01:16,413 --> 05:01:16,813
Thank you.

3356
05:01:16,833 --> 05:01:23,915
I didn't speak too much today because I wanted to make sure the public had a chance to speak, and I didn't want to belabor too many points.

3357
05:01:24,595 --> 05:01:32,998
I wanted to come before you all here today and tell you about how our city really dreamed big and how we created a budget that really combined ambition and actionability.

3358
05:01:33,738 --> 05:01:37,899
But unfortunately, these last two weeks of budget hearings have been grim.

3359
05:01:38,999 --> 05:01:44,701
Lack of transparency and lack of revenue means that we've been put in a difficult last-minute budget crisis.

3360
05:01:45,827 --> 05:01:50,292
Um, and we are we on the council are just as frustrated as you residents are.

3361
05:01:51,253 --> 05:01:53,455
We keep hearing that this is a pandemic problem.

3362
05:01:53,475 --> 05:02:04,246
But the reality is that we're two and a half years to a pandemic that's affected every single city in this Commonwealth and Medford and yet Medford is unique in facing a crisis like this.

3363
05:02:05,154 --> 05:02:15,602
In the past few months that I've been on city council, I've worked particularly hard to foster a friendly and cooperative environment, especially with the mayor's office.

3364
05:02:15,782 --> 05:02:25,029
And I've worked hard to recognize shared priorities, the housing production plan, the comprehensive plan, climate action plan, improving diversity and equity.

3365
05:02:25,770 --> 05:02:29,633
And I've worked very hard to operate in good faith, taking

3366
05:02:30,353 --> 05:02:36,738
you know, even taking some pretty difficult votes, which mainly supported the mayor's priorities.

3367
05:02:38,019 --> 05:02:47,207
I've tried to be reasonable and open-minded with the red lines and requests, making sure that they're, you know, they are actionable, they are achievable.

3368
05:02:47,787 --> 05:02:54,093
And over the last few weeks, I've asked future-focused questions about our department's plans and ambitions to improve our city,

3369
05:02:54,733 --> 05:02:58,356
And the answer through our many, many hours of meetings is clear.

3370
05:02:58,756 --> 05:03:13,447
We have volunteers, we have employees, and we have department heads who are flush with ideas about how we can improve city services, and how we can lift up the standards of living, and how we can ensure that Medford is safe, just, and inclusive.

3371
05:03:14,167 --> 05:03:18,490
But the true Grim Reaper that we face is not a city unwilling to move forward.

3372
05:03:18,791 --> 05:03:22,954
The true Grim Reaper we face are budgets that box us in.

3373
05:03:23,994 --> 05:03:26,916
which is unfortunately what is on the agenda tonight.

3374
05:03:27,816 --> 05:03:31,959
I understand where the mayor's coming from, I understand that this was a difficult budget to put together.

3375
05:03:32,559 --> 05:03:37,882
And I thank the mayor for calling for calling me today and for talking through my concerns.

3376
05:03:40,360 --> 05:03:43,161
you know, we're elected to make difficult choices.

3377
05:03:43,821 --> 05:03:49,323
I've been, I haven't slept more than five hours a night since the beginning of the month.

3378
05:03:51,184 --> 05:03:57,846
But, you know, for the sake of transparency, I do want, I can't conscionably vote yes on this budget.

3379
05:03:59,527 --> 05:04:07,130
you know, there's just some of the simple priorities, right, that we on the council have been talking about, and those on the school committee have asked as basic asks.

3380
05:04:08,430 --> 05:04:20,935
And, you know, this budget doesn't even really delve into the more ambitious concerns about investments in true community safety, the expanding translation programs, veterans programming, etc.

3381
05:04:22,636 --> 05:04:32,190
Those of you who've tuned into city council meetings before know that at the end of the day, when they take a difficult vote, there's really one question, there's one litmus test for me.

3382
05:04:32,951 --> 05:04:36,896
And that question is, does this improve the lives of the residents of our city?

3383
05:04:39,186 --> 05:04:40,927
You know, the answer tonight is regrettably no.

3384
05:04:41,587 --> 05:04:49,130
I don't think this budget as it is would help the longtime resident for whom our roads and sidewalks now pose a challenge to accessibility.

3385
05:04:49,210 --> 05:04:55,513
It wouldn't help the veteran or the new college student coming home who can't afford to settle down here in their hometown.

3386
05:04:56,033 --> 05:04:59,074
And it wouldn't help the renter who's facing an eviction notice.

3387
05:04:59,754 --> 05:05:05,857
It wouldn't necessarily help the parent and child who are catching up on elementary math after two years of the pandemic.

3388
05:05:06,358 --> 05:05:16,963
and it wouldn't help the black, brown, or Asian people in our city who are facing threats of safety and violence.

3389
05:05:17,323 --> 05:05:21,765
We as a council, we're ready for the difficult conversations to get our city back on track.

3390
05:05:22,445 --> 05:05:29,748
And perhaps most importantly, we are ready, and at least personally speaking, I'm excited to work with the city administration to find a way forward.

3391
05:05:30,749 --> 05:05:31,629
But the clock is ticking.

3392
05:05:32,269 --> 05:05:34,810
We have little time to solve a financial conundrum.

3393
05:05:38,011 --> 05:05:44,005
We're, you know, I think everyone's expressed this we just don't we it sucks we don't want to be in this position, but.

3394
05:05:45,003 --> 05:05:53,751
The measures that we've had to take are the only tools that we have as a city council to try to get a budget that's even better for our city.

3395
05:05:54,451 --> 05:06:00,877
This is our only chance for us to build that more ambitious city that we want.

3396
05:06:01,417 --> 05:06:07,622
Again, many of this administration's stated goals and plans are plans that I support and wish to see come true.

3397
05:06:08,403 --> 05:06:13,006
but these plans will remain mere wishes if we don't have the tools to put them into action.

3398
05:06:13,366 --> 05:06:14,467
And that's what I'm asking for.

3399
05:06:14,967 --> 05:06:18,669
Simple, low cost tools that will let us advance our shared priorities.

3400
05:06:19,930 --> 05:06:29,436
I hope in the next few days that we can all work together to get ourselves out of the situation and to advance our shared priorities and goals.

3401
05:06:29,976 --> 05:06:30,296
Thank you.

3402
05:06:31,537 --> 05:06:33,778
Any further discussion from the council?

3403
05:06:34,319 --> 05:06:34,759
Councilor Knight.

3404
05:06:35,262 --> 05:06:36,564
Madam President, thank you very much.

3405
05:06:37,685 --> 05:06:45,816
First of all, I think this council owes you a debt of gratitude because it wouldn't be where we are today, if it wasn't for your persistence.

3406
05:06:46,657 --> 05:06:50,302
You're not allowed to sit down we're going to give you what you want the big seat you got to stand up.

3407
05:06:52,424 --> 05:06:55,506
But we wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for your persistence.

3408
05:06:55,967 --> 05:07:01,170
Since your election as council president, you've been across the hall banging on the door saying, when are we going to start the budget hearings?

3409
05:07:01,191 --> 05:07:02,331
When are we going to start the budget hearings?

3410
05:07:02,351 --> 05:07:03,432
When are we going to start the budget hearings?

3411
05:07:03,873 --> 05:07:08,596
And it's because of that persistence that we're able to make the decisions that we've made tonight.

3412
05:07:08,636 --> 05:07:17,163
And we were also able to receive the information that we've received, albeit in a fashion that maybe not satisfied many of us, but nonetheless got us through a process.

3413
05:07:17,843 --> 05:07:21,346
Now, quite frankly, for me, Madam President, this isn't about an organization.

3414
05:07:21,366 --> 05:07:24,028
This isn't about a corporation, all right?

3415
05:07:24,308 --> 05:07:25,590
This is about our city, all right?

3416
05:07:25,610 --> 05:07:26,390
This is about Medford.

3417
05:07:27,111 --> 05:07:27,891
It's about our neighbors.

3418
05:07:28,832 --> 05:07:30,934
It's about our family, our kids, all right?

3419
05:07:30,954 --> 05:07:35,258
It's about the men and women that go to work every day and try to make this city great.

3420
05:07:37,720 --> 05:07:44,805
And when we look at what's going on before COVID and since, we've seen an absolute HR nightmare.

3421
05:07:45,756 --> 05:07:48,218
when it comes to various department heads in this building.

3422
05:07:50,380 --> 05:07:57,025
We've seen the council call for quarterly meetings on the financial health of this community to no avail.

3423
05:07:58,206 --> 05:08:08,434
We've seen the council beg and plead for a copy of the monthly warrant articles, showing us where the money's being spent to the point where we've had to ask that the solicitor draft an ordinance for us.

3424
05:08:10,195 --> 05:08:14,719
When COVID hit, I thought it was the perfect opportunity for us to hit the reset button.

3425
05:08:16,381 --> 05:08:28,945
to look at some zero-based budgeting, where appropriations are actually based upon measurables, not a recycled budget from when Mr. Glione was the town manager, with little modifications throughout the last 40 years.

3426
05:08:33,266 --> 05:08:35,267
So here we are asking for information.

3427
05:08:36,627 --> 05:08:39,108
Between May and July, we virtually go undergoing.

3428
05:08:40,269 --> 05:08:44,810
And then come May and June, the council's got a seat at the table finally.

3429
05:08:46,216 --> 05:08:56,940
And when we finally have a seat at the table and we raise all those issues that we talked about for the last year, we get told any action other than a rubber stamp will be detrimental to this organization.

3430
05:09:00,642 --> 05:09:01,942
I don't think we can operate like this.

3431
05:09:04,123 --> 05:09:06,484
I don't think we can continue to afford to operate like this.

3432
05:09:06,804 --> 05:09:10,726
There's not a road in this street that you, not a road or a street in the city that you can drive down.

3433
05:09:11,887 --> 05:09:12,787
It's not in disrepair.

3434
05:09:14,954 --> 05:09:20,477
There's not a road or a street in this city that doesn't have a stump that's seven feet tall for some reason, but all the stumps are this tall.

3435
05:09:20,517 --> 05:09:21,937
They're gonna cut the tree down, cut the tree down.

3436
05:09:22,057 --> 05:09:23,698
I mean, come on, enough's enough, right?

3437
05:09:23,738 --> 05:09:25,399
I mean, the things are gigantic, right?

3438
05:09:25,699 --> 05:09:33,863
At the end of the day, you know, services have been degraded to the point where we have to hit the reset button.

3439
05:09:34,804 --> 05:09:38,946
And, you know, as I said, for me, this is about this city.

3440
05:09:39,966 --> 05:09:47,273
This is about our neighbors, our kids, our families, and the hard working men and women that go to work every day to make this city great.

3441
05:09:47,614 --> 05:09:49,255
Those are the people with their boots on the ground.

3442
05:09:49,736 --> 05:09:51,798
Those aren't the people with these things in front of their desks.

3443
05:09:52,118 --> 05:09:53,860
All right, we're not the ones that make the city great.

3444
05:09:54,120 --> 05:09:56,663
We make informed decisions to move that process along.

3445
05:09:56,983 --> 05:10:02,109
But it's the people in this room that were up here advocating and fighting for themselves that make the city great.

3446
05:10:02,189 --> 05:10:03,270
And they're what make a community.

3447
05:10:04,317 --> 05:10:06,919
And quite frankly, I think that this budget doesn't support that.

3448
05:10:07,580 --> 05:10:08,281
It misses the mark.

3449
05:10:08,941 --> 05:10:10,583
And for that reason, I won't be voting for it this evening.

3450
05:10:11,804 --> 05:10:12,544
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

3451
05:10:13,445 --> 05:10:15,547
Any further discussion from the council at this time?

3452
05:10:15,567 --> 05:10:20,852
I do see Director Hunt on Zoom who hasn't spoken yet, and then I'll go to you, Madam Chief of Staff.

3453
05:10:25,316 --> 05:10:27,118
Madam President, thank you very much.

3454
05:10:29,237 --> 05:10:32,159
Sorry for the late hour and my scratchy voice.

3455
05:10:32,979 --> 05:10:38,442
Can someone please explain what it means for the staff on July 1st if the staff, the council votes no?

3456
05:10:38,823 --> 05:10:41,784
There are actually a number of staff watching this evening.

3457
05:10:42,305 --> 05:10:47,968
Does the city close for 45 days and people get furloughed like the federal government until it goes into effect?

3458
05:10:48,388 --> 05:10:52,631
What are we supposed to tell the people that work for us tomorrow when we go into the office?

3459
05:10:53,411 --> 05:10:57,435
Um, or does the finance office have to create a one 12th budget in the next few days.

3460
05:10:57,916 --> 05:11:10,768
I'm concerned that we really need our finance office to return to regular work, so that we can meet our legal obligations on grants and projects money, many of these have end of year fiscal deadlines that we are trying to meet as well.

3461
05:11:11,088 --> 05:11:14,592
And if they need to spend time on a one 12th budget they won't have time for that work.

3462
05:11:15,913 --> 05:11:21,759
No more important financial responsibility from our finance office than the fiscal health of this community and in the city budget.

3463
05:11:21,939 --> 05:11:23,601
All right, I don't care what else is going on.

3464
05:11:23,881 --> 05:11:28,786
Nothing's more important than the fiscal health of this city, and the operating budget, because we can't operate without.

3465
05:11:29,186 --> 05:11:35,153
We can't move forward right so we got to get back to a spot where we can operate, and we can deliver services and we're not there.

3466
05:11:35,693 --> 05:11:35,893
All right.

3467
05:11:36,073 --> 05:11:39,654
Many of us are working very hard every single day.

3468
05:11:40,075 --> 05:11:41,055
Thank you very much.

3469
05:11:41,395 --> 05:11:45,396
Those stumps are seven feet tall to protect the site impaired people.

3470
05:11:45,796 --> 05:11:46,877
It's a safety issue.

3471
05:11:47,157 --> 05:11:49,618
There are many roads that are repaired and that work well.

3472
05:11:50,058 --> 05:11:58,921
And frankly, we take a lot of offense to some of the derogatory things that you're saying about the hardworking city staff in City Hall.

3473
05:11:59,601 --> 05:12:01,102
We all would love to see more money.

3474
05:12:01,122 --> 05:12:04,643
And I don't understand where more money is going to come from.

3475
05:12:06,137 --> 05:12:06,517
Thank you.

3476
05:12:06,537 --> 05:12:12,861
So that if the council takes no action or does not approve the budget that nothing changes on July 1 city continues to function, staff continue to be paid.

3477
05:12:27,480 --> 05:12:28,580
Expenses continue to be paid.

3478
05:12:29,001 --> 05:12:36,043
That's what the lawyers who do this every day, the municipal finance law team at the Division of Local Services said to me earlier this month.

3479
05:12:39,545 --> 05:12:40,145
Madam Chair and staff.

3480
05:12:40,645 --> 05:12:41,706
Madam President, thank you.

3481
05:12:42,406 --> 05:12:54,911
I certainly was not on the call with Vice President Behrs and I can't dispute what was shared with him by DLS, but I do find that hard to believe because there is another statute that describes that if the budget is not passed by June 30th,

3482
05:12:56,391 --> 05:12:58,672
then the city must enter into 112th budget.

3483
05:12:59,653 --> 05:13:14,221
That would mean that our finance office would now have to go back, ask all of our departments to create 112th budgets, school department, public works, police, fire, every single budget that's listed on that city council paper.

3484
05:13:14,782 --> 05:13:24,167
What I would propose is if the city council would be willing is to revert to its regular business and return to this matter so that I can contact the mayor

3485
05:13:25,571 --> 05:13:30,995
because mechanically, we, Councilor Sang, we are running out of time.

3486
05:13:31,575 --> 05:13:34,998
Mechanically, June 30th is an important date for all of us.

3487
05:13:36,058 --> 05:13:45,945
So my proposal would be give me five to 10 minutes so that I can consult with the mayor and discuss this matter further because this is a timing issue.

3488
05:13:46,005 --> 05:13:48,487
It's a major timing issue in front of us.

3489
05:13:51,169 --> 05:13:52,710
We have five and a half hours, Madam Mayor.

3490
05:13:54,258 --> 05:13:56,259
Madam President, I've been out for five and a half hours.

3491
05:14:00,162 --> 05:14:00,822
It's five minutes.

3492
05:14:02,623 --> 05:14:03,824
It's just five minutes.

3493
05:14:03,844 --> 05:14:09,727
I have a question as to whether or not a meeting can even go past midnight into the next day when it's been posted for yesterday.

3494
05:14:11,088 --> 05:14:12,449
It hasn't stayed in practice.

3495
05:14:12,929 --> 05:14:15,991
I mean, I don't know what answer we're gonna get in the next five minutes.

3496
05:14:16,431 --> 05:14:21,174
So I have a motion from Councilor Collins to return to our, because we still have a agenda.

3497
05:14:24,931 --> 05:14:37,554
There are three items that people are still here on, 22-429, the Community Preservation Committee Appropriation, the appointment, and also, which is 430, and also I think Ms.

3498
05:14:37,574 --> 05:14:40,255
Cuddy's been here around the National Grid Paper 22-409.

3499
05:14:40,275 --> 05:14:45,736
So maybe we can take one of those and see if we get a different answer in the next 10 minutes.

3500
05:14:47,097 --> 05:14:48,557
Do I have a motion to

3501
05:14:50,773 --> 05:14:54,014
Motion to table paper 22-408 and take up paper 22-429.

3502
05:14:54,114 --> 05:14:55,334
Sorry, 409, my apologies.

3503
05:14:55,354 --> 05:14:59,715
Motion to revise the table paper, budget paper 22-408 and take up paper 22-409?

3504
05:14:59,735 --> 05:15:00,015
Yes.

3505
05:15:00,215 --> 05:15:00,935
Seconded by?

3506
05:15:00,955 --> 05:15:01,455
So moved.

3507
05:15:04,436 --> 05:15:06,156
Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

3508
05:15:06,176 --> 05:15:06,236
Aye.

3509
05:15:07,136 --> 05:15:08,017
All those opposed?

3510
05:15:08,057 --> 05:15:08,817
Motion passes.

3511
05:15:21,631 --> 05:15:21,811
22-409.

3512
05:15:21,931 --> 05:15:22,131
409 or 429?

3513
05:15:22,171 --> 05:15:22,131
409.

3514
05:15:22,251 --> 05:15:22,471
Sorry, 409.

3515
05:15:22,511 --> 05:15:23,291
Which one's 409?

3516
05:15:26,652 --> 05:15:35,054
It's the petition for grant of location.

3517
05:15:35,374 --> 05:15:35,995
Oh, okay.

3518
05:15:36,015 --> 05:15:36,335
22-409.

3519
05:15:36,415 --> 05:15:40,516
Leilaniwa's petition for grant of location.

3520
05:15:51,117 --> 05:15:54,961
National Grid North Vanderbilt, Massachusetts, Gas Locations, Metro Massachusetts City Clerk's Office.

3521
05:15:54,981 --> 05:16:04,050
You are hereby notified that the Metro City Council will hold a public hearing in the Howard F. Alden Memorial Auditorium, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, City Hall, Metro Mass at 7 p.m.

3522
05:16:04,310 --> 05:16:05,831
on Tuesday, June 28, 2022.

3523
05:16:07,513 --> 05:16:11,679
But there's a link to be posted no later than June 24 2022 and a petition of National Grid Inc.

3524
05:16:12,119 --> 05:16:23,394

Hassett Drive, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155.

3528
05:17:26,573 --> 05:17:29,434
The following, the following, I'm almost done.

3529
05:17:30,994 --> 05:17:39,384
The following the streets and highways referred to to install a replacement regulator station in the sidewalk on Harbor Street location approximately is shown on plan label w slash oh number 9000195.

3530
05:17:42,441 --> 05:17:49,244
252, dated April 14, 2022, last revised on June 2nd, 2022, and filed with the office of the city clerk, approved chief engineer, and the following conditions.

3531
05:17:49,925 --> 05:17:57,008
The engineering division received revised plans from national grid that includes a six inch regulator vault replacement in Harvard street with latest revision date of June 2nd, 2022.

3532
05:17:57,528 --> 05:18:01,971
The plan appears to address comments from engineering division review.

3533
05:18:02,011 --> 05:18:05,733
The engineering division recommends that this grand location be approved with the following conditions.

3534
05:18:07,714 --> 05:18:10,375
To suspend the remainder of the reading for a summary of the conditions.

3535
05:18:11,753 --> 05:18:15,498
On a motion of Vice President Bear, seconded by Councilor Sang, all those in favor?

3536
05:18:15,839 --> 05:18:15,959
Aye.

3537
05:18:16,119 --> 05:18:17,461
All those opposed?

3538
05:18:18,643 --> 05:18:20,525
Either I think Ms.

3539
05:18:20,986 --> 05:18:24,631
Cuddy or we do have, I don't know who it is.

3540
05:18:24,651 --> 05:18:25,792
Commissioner McGibbon is here as well.

3541
05:18:25,812 --> 05:18:28,937
Commissioner McGibbon, if you want to speak on the conditions of this grant allocation.

3542
05:18:32,205 --> 05:18:35,228
Good morning, Madam President and Council.

3543
05:18:35,268 --> 05:18:36,128
My name is Diana Cuddy.

3544
05:18:36,148 --> 05:18:44,475
I'm from National Grid 40 Sylvan Road, Waltham, Massachusetts, and I'm here to request a grant allocation for a regulator station in Harvard Street.

3545
05:18:45,115 --> 05:18:51,700
The project engineer, Purbash, is on via Zoom if there's any very technical questions.

3546
05:18:52,421 --> 05:19:01,368
And I just want to say this is a critical infrastructure improvement to our system in Medford to provide a safe and reliable

3547
05:19:01,825 --> 05:19:04,026
energy source to our growing community here.

3548
05:19:05,687 --> 05:19:08,328
And so, it's Pravesh.

3549
05:19:08,348 --> 05:19:14,190
Councillor Knight.

3550
05:19:14,910 --> 05:19:16,011
Two questions, Madam President.

3551
05:19:16,031 --> 05:19:23,534
The first question is it appears based upon the reading of this application that all the work will be done exclusively along the sidewalk?

3552
05:19:23,674 --> 05:19:25,275
Actually, Pravesh, I'll defer that to you.

3553
05:19:25,355 --> 05:19:27,476
Most of the big work will be in the sidewalk.

3554
05:19:27,496 --> 05:19:28,436
That's correct, yes.

3555
05:19:28,596 --> 05:19:29,737
All the work will be sidewalk.

3556
05:19:29,757 --> 05:19:30,617
We will be doing

3557
05:19:31,785 --> 05:19:34,567
A couple of main tie-ins on the road.

3558
05:19:36,247 --> 05:19:42,350
So the infrastructure, the main... I think it's two small tie-ins in the street.

3559
05:19:42,531 --> 05:19:43,711
Oh, okay, small tie-in in the street.

3560
05:19:43,731 --> 05:19:46,072
But the big regulator vault will go into the site.

3561
05:19:46,112 --> 05:19:48,794
Will there be a traffic planning plan there?

3562
05:19:48,814 --> 05:19:49,874
Will the road be closed down?

3563
05:19:50,274 --> 05:19:53,856
There will be a certain point that... So actually, yes.

3564
05:19:53,916 --> 05:19:57,018
And this, as you guys mentioned, is a very critical project to us.

3565
05:19:57,778 --> 05:20:00,820
So in preparation for tonight, Pravesh and I have met with the

3566
05:20:01,630 --> 05:20:04,132
City of Medford Police Department and the Traffic Management Plan.

3567
05:20:04,172 --> 05:20:08,795
We've met with Tim and Owen and- Todd Blake.

3568
05:20:09,276 --> 05:20:10,216
Ironed out by them.

3569
05:20:10,256 --> 05:20:10,937
Go ahead, Pramesh.

3570
05:20:11,838 --> 05:20:18,823
Yeah, so yeah, we've met with Todd Blake, the Medford Traffic Engineer, as well as the Police Chief to iron out the Traffic Management Plan.

3571
05:20:19,643 --> 05:20:28,450
As part of the plan, we will have to shut down Harvard Street and reroute traffic through Boston Ave, College Ave, and George Street down back to Main Street.

3572
05:20:30,528 --> 05:20:33,150
not for the whole duration of the project.

3573
05:20:33,771 --> 05:20:33,991
Correct.

3574
05:20:34,051 --> 05:20:37,154
I heard that Somerville really likes it if you could detour the cars through Somerville.

3575
05:20:37,694 --> 05:20:40,236
Is that a metric when you do that?

3576
05:20:40,256 --> 05:20:41,938
But all right, thank you very much.

3577
05:20:41,978 --> 05:20:45,341
Now, how long is this going to take?

3578
05:20:45,361 --> 05:20:46,402
Eight weeks.

3579
05:20:46,522 --> 05:20:49,144
Eight to 10 weeks.

3580
05:20:49,805 --> 05:20:51,506
And when are you going to be doing the work during the day?

3581
05:20:52,307 --> 05:20:54,629
Yeah, that would be part of the permitting.

3582
05:20:54,889 --> 05:20:55,830
We spoke with Owen.

3583
05:20:57,138 --> 05:20:59,001
and the police department and the traffic.

3584
05:20:59,041 --> 05:21:04,088
And so I think the hours we have, um, identified 93, I believe.

3585
05:21:04,108 --> 05:21:06,272
Thank you very much.

3586
05:21:06,332 --> 05:21:06,572
Yeah.

3587
05:21:06,592 --> 05:21:10,999
Any other questions from the council at this time?

3588
05:21:11,019 --> 05:21:13,162
Um, sure.

3589
05:21:15,664 --> 05:21:19,128
and set up to make sure that the neighbors all are informed.

3590
05:21:19,148 --> 05:21:26,196
I know that one of the biggest things that we're seeing, especially with the Eversource project, is a lack of communication with the neighbors.

3591
05:21:26,736 --> 05:21:33,644
Is there someone that's going to be the person that's going to be meeting with the neighbors and giving them the updates?

3592
05:21:33,684 --> 05:21:35,146
And then if it affects any

3593
05:21:36,367 --> 05:21:45,556
I know we always have issues with neighbors that see citizens that need access to the driveways and, you know, access to getting out for dogs appointments, whatnot.

3594
05:21:45,616 --> 05:21:47,858
But, uh, I want to make sure that's there.

3595
05:21:47,918 --> 05:21:48,579
So, right.

3596
05:21:48,639 --> 05:21:52,983
So Matt Carmody is a supervisor on this project and he's done a lot of work in Medford.

3597
05:21:53,344 --> 05:21:57,688
Um, also this regulator station isn't like a big long main, uh, replacement or new main,

3598
05:21:58,034 --> 05:22:01,536
It's localized to in front of 171, 173 Harvard Street.

3599
05:22:02,016 --> 05:22:06,578
We've spoken to the homeowner there and anything else like that.

3600
05:22:06,658 --> 05:22:14,062
Yes, what they typically do is they'll send out letter notices and then they'll also put the little flyer things on the doorknob.

3601
05:22:14,182 --> 05:22:21,646
Just to notify them that there is going to be some restrictions and travel flow, I think that'll be very helpful.

3602
05:22:21,686 --> 05:22:21,886
Thank you.

3603
05:22:21,906 --> 05:22:22,387
Yes, yep.

3604
05:22:22,647 --> 05:22:22,887
Thank you.

3605
05:22:24,417 --> 05:22:26,398
Where is this is a public hearing.

3606
05:22:26,418 --> 05:22:28,119
I do need to open the public hearing.

3607
05:22:28,520 --> 05:22:34,743
So if there is anyone who would like to speak in favor of the paper at hand, please speak now.

3608
05:22:35,804 --> 05:22:35,964
Ms.

3609
05:22:35,984 --> 05:22:39,606
Cuddy, that would be you if you want to speak in favor of the paper.

3610
05:22:40,027 --> 05:22:41,527
Yes, I'm in favor of this project.

3611
05:22:41,547 --> 05:22:41,868
Thank you.

3612
05:22:41,888 --> 05:22:44,269
Anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the paper?

3613
05:22:46,130 --> 05:22:48,472
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

3614
05:22:48,752 --> 05:22:49,732
Councilor Knight.

3615
05:22:50,033 --> 05:22:51,273
Madam President, if I do recall,

3616
05:22:52,683 --> 05:22:58,707
There was some discussion when they were doing some Greenland extension work that we had half a street paved curb to curb.

3617
05:22:59,468 --> 05:23:07,894
If I'm not mistaken, at one point in time, maybe within the last several years, maybe the city engineer, the former city engineer and now DPW commissioner.

3618
05:23:08,875 --> 05:23:09,095
Yeah.

3619
05:23:13,378 --> 05:23:15,199
Who's still awake by now watching.

3620
05:23:16,665 --> 05:23:18,006
Yeah, I'm so awake.

3621
05:23:18,827 --> 05:23:19,568
Hold on.

3622
05:23:19,848 --> 05:23:20,308
Yeah, we did.

3623
05:23:20,348 --> 05:23:25,273
We did pave Harvard Street, and there was a bunch of work, including gas work done.

3624
05:23:25,953 --> 05:23:27,174
This was brought to our attention.

3625
05:23:27,394 --> 05:23:32,038
After that, we did explore alternate locations with National Grid.

3626
05:23:32,479 --> 05:23:40,886
And this did seem like the best location as far as impact to the community goes, size of the construction project.

3627
05:23:42,547 --> 05:23:44,788
It's not the greatest location as far as traffic.

3628
05:23:45,188 --> 05:23:46,929
Forget about that stuff.

3629
05:23:47,249 --> 05:23:48,330
When did we repave that street?

3630
05:23:48,830 --> 05:23:49,870
Was that within the last five years?

3631
05:23:50,610 --> 05:23:52,131
Yes, it does fall into more than five years.

3632
05:23:52,151 --> 05:23:53,992
So when they do the tie-in, they have to go curb to curb?

3633
05:23:54,572 --> 05:23:54,992
That's correct.

3634
05:23:55,012 --> 05:24:00,975
So the way that we handle these situations is curb to curb with an offset that the engineering

3635
05:24:01,623 --> 05:24:03,104
division determines in the field.

3636
05:24:03,144 --> 05:24:07,926
So the offset longitudinal, so curb to curb, and then we see what makes sense for the time.

3637
05:24:07,966 --> 05:24:08,406
All right.

3638
05:24:08,606 --> 05:24:08,786
Yeah.

3639
05:24:08,827 --> 05:24:11,028
So we get it this way, but you guys will figure out this way.

3640
05:24:11,368 --> 05:24:11,668
Exactly.

3641
05:24:11,768 --> 05:24:11,988
Okay.

3642
05:24:12,088 --> 05:24:12,728
Thank you very much.

3643
05:24:12,748 --> 05:24:13,189
You're welcome.

3644
05:24:15,910 --> 05:24:23,894
Actually, that is built into the budget for these types of projects, just so you know, because we do curb to centerline or curb to curb, depending on the field conditions.

3645
05:24:27,358 --> 05:24:27,678
Thank you.

3646
05:24:27,778 --> 05:24:32,462
And as this is a public hearing, is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the paper?

3647
05:24:32,482 --> 05:24:34,824
No person on Zoom.

3648
05:24:36,425 --> 05:24:39,708
Seeing none, portion of the public hearing is closed.

3649
05:24:39,728 --> 05:24:40,709
Do I have a motion on the floor?

3650
05:24:46,353 --> 05:24:51,698
So we do have a new, with the new council rules, it's a six day public comment period, so.

3651
05:24:53,467 --> 05:25:02,729
that I would even not move to waive it would be due to the large scale community act activity from some of the residents of the Lincoln Kennedy condominiums.

3652
05:25:02,889 --> 05:25:06,429
I want to make sure that they're well aware that this project is going to take place before it goes off.

3653
05:25:06,789 --> 05:25:07,089
Thank you.

3654
05:25:07,849 --> 05:25:16,311
So on the motion of Councilor Knight to approve with the waiting period, seconded by Councilor Sang, what call can I do?

3655
05:25:20,292 --> 05:25:21,592
I think we should do it.

3656
05:25:21,612 --> 05:25:22,872
Okay, please call the roll.

3657
05:25:28,543 --> 05:25:29,643
Yeah.

3658
05:25:29,743 --> 05:25:39,046
Yes.

3659
05:25:39,066 --> 05:25:39,186
Yes.

3660
05:25:39,206 --> 05:25:39,386
Yes.

3661
05:26:00,908 --> 05:26:04,571
Councilor.

3662
05:26:06,252 --> 05:26:08,494
Yes, Senator Fernandez, you're in the negative, the motion passes.

3663
05:26:08,514 --> 05:26:11,356
I'm gonna pass off to, thank you, Vice President Ferris.

3664
05:26:11,616 --> 05:26:12,057
Thank you.

3665
05:26:27,749 --> 05:26:30,131
The other motions, or the other items before us,

3666
05:26:31,268 --> 05:26:33,369
I believe Community Preservation Committee is still here.

3667
05:26:33,390 --> 05:26:35,751
Is there a motion to take paper 22-429?

3668
05:26:35,771 --> 05:26:38,613
Motion to take 22-429, seconded by Councilor Sang.

3669
05:26:38,633 --> 05:26:39,374
All those in favor?

3670
05:26:39,394 --> 05:26:40,094
Motion passes.

3671
05:26:40,114 --> 05:26:40,475
22-429, June 23rd, 2022.

3672
05:26:42,076 --> 05:26:43,797
To President Morrell, from Mayor Lango-Kun,

3673
05:27:01,947 --> 05:27:19,053
Dear President Morrell, members of the city council, on behalf of the CPC, I respectfully request that your honorable body approve the following recommendation requesting the appropriation of $65,500 from the CPA General Reserve to the Medford Historical Commission for the Thomas Brooks Park Master Plan Implementation Phase 1.

3674
05:27:20,213 --> 05:27:26,736
Project will be tracked in the General Reserve, a community preservation fund by category General Reserve, and close, please find a copy of the project summary.

3675
05:27:27,336 --> 05:27:28,416
Thank you for your consideration.

3676
05:27:28,496 --> 05:27:30,457
Respectfully submitted, Brianna Lego-Kern, Mayor.

3677
05:27:37,488 --> 05:27:39,249
Jones here, 40 Cedar Road North.

3678
05:27:39,369 --> 05:27:43,773
I believe Ryan Hayward should be on the Zoom call.

3679
05:27:44,613 --> 05:27:45,174
Eastie.

3680
05:27:46,675 --> 05:27:53,660
I just want to make a note that this is the first time anything that said Brooks, master plan on it, that Tom Lincoln wasn't here for.

3681
05:27:54,081 --> 05:27:55,822
I hope he's okay.

3682
05:27:56,823 --> 05:27:57,483
Different Brooks.

3683
05:27:57,543 --> 05:28:01,186
I've just asked Ryan Hayward to unmute if he hasn't fallen asleep at the computer.

3684
05:28:01,226 --> 05:28:02,467
Here he is.

3685
05:28:02,487 --> 05:28:05,890
Name and address for the record, please, Ryan.

3686
05:28:11,660 --> 05:28:11,880
here.

3687
05:28:14,043 --> 05:28:19,088
We can hear you there it's Brian Hayward 40 Sheridan Ave Medford Medford Historical Commission.

3688
05:28:22,072 --> 05:28:22,672
Oh, I'm just.

3689
05:28:36,106 --> 05:28:37,507
that I had to turn off my TV.

3690
05:28:38,408 --> 05:28:55,001
So we received a bid for the stone wall work for this project and it's in the amount of $325,000, which is a little bit more than what we were allocated for this portion of the project.

3691
05:28:55,101 --> 05:29:02,527
So I just, we went to CPC, CPC agreed that we could get the remaining $65,500 that we need to undertake this work.

3692
05:29:07,716 --> 05:29:09,499
That's all we're asking for at this point.

3693
05:29:09,780 --> 05:29:14,109
It's a complete restoration of the stone wall along the whole length of the six acre park.

3694
05:29:17,597 --> 05:29:22,941
The consultant was pretty clear that he'd be able to undertake that work this year and get it done.

3695
05:29:24,082 --> 05:29:28,346
So we're asking if you guys allocate that work, it'll be the last portion of this project.

3696
05:29:28,426 --> 05:29:31,648
We completed the archeological dig portion of it.

3697
05:29:31,748 --> 05:29:35,131
We're about to undertake the restoration on the brick wall.

3698
05:29:35,712 --> 05:29:40,395
So this is the last component that we've been chasing basically.

3699
05:29:41,576 --> 05:29:42,197
Thank you, Mr. Hayward.

3700
05:29:42,277 --> 05:29:43,178

05:30:13,032 --> 05:30:13,172
Yes.

3716
05:30:13,693 --> 05:30:14,233
President Morrell.

3717
05:30:18,672 --> 05:30:19,352
That's everybody.

3718
05:30:21,173 --> 05:30:24,294
Six in the affirmative, one temporarily absent, the motion passes.

3719
05:30:25,974 --> 05:30:26,454
Thank you.

3720
05:30:26,474 --> 05:30:31,936
I believe actually the last thing we had on that someone's been waiting here for is Mr. Schrader.

3721
05:30:31,956 --> 05:30:35,637
Oh, the appointment, the appointment, sorry.

3722
05:30:36,337 --> 05:30:37,938
My bad, it's late.

3723
05:30:42,525 --> 05:30:46,708
22-430, is there a motion to take that off the table?

3724
05:30:47,348 --> 05:30:50,971
Or to take it as a suspension by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang.

3725
05:30:51,031 --> 05:30:51,651
All those in favor?

3726
05:30:52,432 --> 05:30:52,892
Opposed?

3727
05:30:53,172 --> 05:30:53,773
Motion passes.

3728
05:30:53,793 --> 05:30:54,093
22-430, June 23rd, 2022.

3729
05:30:58,318 --> 05:31:04,583
To the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, re-Community Preservation Committee appointment.

3730
05:31:05,483 --> 05:31:15,651
Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, I respect the request and recommend that your Honorable body confirm the appointment of Matthew Lemming of 12 Willis Avenue to the Community Preservation Committee for a term of three years.

3731
05:31:15,691 --> 05:31:17,272
A copy of Matthew's resume is attached.

3732
05:31:17,913 --> 05:31:19,454
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

3733
05:31:19,514 --> 05:31:21,416
Sincerely, Brianna Legault Kern, Mayor.

3734
05:31:23,077 --> 05:31:27,180
I don't know, Joan or Matthew, if you, all right, we'll go.

3735
05:31:27,717 --> 05:31:29,518
Hello, my name is Matt Lemming.

3736
05:31:29,618 --> 05:31:32,581
I live at 112 Willis Avenue.

3737
05:31:32,641 --> 05:31:35,163
I'm a 29-year-old renter here.

3738
05:31:35,343 --> 05:31:45,210
I do a lot of work in housing Medford as well as housing advocacy through the Unitarian Church in Medford.

3739
05:31:45,230 --> 05:31:48,553
I work as a scientist down at Mass General Brigham.

3740
05:31:50,714 --> 05:31:50,914
Yeah.

3741
05:31:52,215 --> 05:31:52,856
Thank you, Mr. Lemming.

3742
05:31:52,876 --> 05:31:53,937
Questions from the council?

3743
05:31:55,403 --> 05:31:56,164
Councilor Nye.

3744
05:31:56,364 --> 05:32:05,411
I believe that the way that CPC is structured is that there's a certain statutory positions that are required representatives from the Park Commission, right?

3745
05:32:05,972 --> 05:32:09,034
Representatives from the Historic Commission, and then we have some open positions as well.

3746
05:32:09,795 --> 05:32:15,119
And those open positions would be subject to council approval where the other positions are not, if I'm not mistaken, correct, Joan?

3747
05:32:15,379 --> 05:32:17,141
It's been a long time since we worked on this one.

3748
05:32:17,161 --> 05:32:18,602
I know, I know, a long time.

3749
05:32:18,642 --> 05:32:19,603
It's amazing.

3750
05:32:20,123 --> 05:32:24,207
Now, where you are coming in as a general

3751
05:32:25,646 --> 05:32:26,106
nominee.

3752
05:32:27,007 --> 05:32:30,289
I heard you say a little bit about housing.

3753
05:32:30,689 --> 05:32:32,430
Is that what your focus is going to be on here?

3754
05:32:32,470 --> 05:32:37,333
Or is that going to be one of your areas of expertise that you're offering us here?

3755
05:32:37,533 --> 05:32:39,995
Or, you know, why do you want to be on the CPC?

3756
05:32:40,015 --> 05:32:41,576
Why should we vote for you?

3757
05:32:41,616 --> 05:32:42,376
I guess is the question.

3758
05:32:42,616 --> 05:32:44,397
That's what they ask me when I run for office every year.

3759
05:32:44,417 --> 05:32:45,318
Let's ask you that question.

3760
05:32:47,392 --> 05:33:01,144
Well, the, the three areas, the CBC focuses on is open areas and recreation historical preservation as well as housing obviously my chief area of interest is housing.

3761
05:33:01,164 --> 05:33:02,165
I mean I'm a.

3762
05:33:02,965 --> 05:33:06,826
I'm a renter here, I'm a postdoc, I make like $53,000 a year.

3763
05:33:06,846 --> 05:33:09,627
I would like to stay in Medford long-term.

3764
05:33:09,908 --> 05:33:22,232
Obviously, a part of doing that is being able to afford to live here, so I'm very personally invested in housing affordability in this city.

3765
05:33:22,252 --> 05:33:28,354
I've, so just, sorry, I'm a little bit,

3766
05:33:30,300 --> 05:33:34,644
and can we expect you to fill out the duration of the term?

3767
05:33:35,204 --> 05:33:35,405
Yes.

3768
05:33:37,226 --> 05:33:38,707
Councilor Morrell, President Morrell.

3769
05:33:39,348 --> 05:33:44,993
I have no questions, just the fact that you stayed here all night for this moment makes you clearly qualified for the role.

3770
05:33:45,013 --> 05:33:48,056
So thank you for being here for six hours and into the next day.

3771
05:33:48,856 --> 05:33:49,397
Same to you, Joan.

3772
05:33:51,399 --> 05:33:53,040
Any further questions from the council?

3773
05:33:53,581 --> 05:33:54,401
Councilor Collins.

3774
05:33:55,102 --> 05:33:55,883
I would move approval.

3775
05:33:55,903 --> 05:33:56,043
Second.

3776
05:33:57,581 --> 05:34:00,163
On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve, seconded by Councilor Sang.

3777
05:34:00,183 --> 05:34:01,344
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

3778
05:34:04,866 --> 05:34:05,907
Can we do a voice vote?

3779
05:34:08,449 --> 05:34:09,149
No, okay.

3780
05:34:10,390 --> 05:34:12,852
No, no, this is the confirmation to the CPC.

3781
05:34:16,354 --> 05:34:17,155
Let's just do a roll call.

3782
05:34:17,995 --> 05:34:18,696
Councilor Kerrio?

3783
05:34:19,116 --> 05:34:19,296
Yes.

3784
05:34:20,497 --> 05:34:21,078
Councilor Collins?

3785
05:34:21,398 --> 05:34:21,598
Yes.

3786
05:34:22,499 --> 05:34:22,899
Councilor Dyke?

3787
05:34:23,593 --> 05:34:23,813
Yes.

3788
05:34:24,474 --> 05:34:25,055
Councilor Scarpelli.

3789
05:34:25,095 --> 05:34:25,175
Yes.

3790
05:34:26,536 --> 05:34:27,096
Councilor Seng.

3791
05:34:27,237 --> 05:34:27,437
Yes.

3792
05:34:27,757 --> 05:34:28,358
President Morrell.

3793
05:34:28,498 --> 05:34:28,718
Yes.

3794
05:34:29,218 --> 05:34:30,039
Vice president Behrs.

3795
05:34:30,640 --> 05:34:30,900
Yes.

3796
05:34:30,920 --> 05:34:33,142
70 affirmative, zero the negative motion passes.

3797
05:34:33,182 --> 05:34:33,943
Congratulations.

3798
05:34:33,983 --> 05:34:34,303
Thank you.

3799
05:34:34,583 --> 05:34:35,404
Thank you.

3800
05:34:35,985 --> 05:34:43,191
At this point I've been notified that paper 20-400 that was on the table has not been requested to be taken up tonight.

3801
05:34:45,213 --> 05:34:47,015
That was the coffee cart.

3802
05:35:03,323 --> 05:35:12,288
So, do I have a motion to take from the table 22-408?

3803
05:35:12,308 --> 05:35:19,092
Or do you want to go through records?

3804
05:35:29,174 --> 05:35:32,396
On the motion of Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Sang.

3805
05:35:32,416 --> 05:35:33,096
All those in favor?

3806
05:35:33,276 --> 05:35:33,476
Aye.

3807
05:35:33,776 --> 05:35:34,797
All those opposed?

3808
05:35:34,837 --> 05:35:35,697
Motion passes.

3809
05:35:37,058 --> 05:35:38,559
Madam Mayor, Madam Chief of Staff.

3810
05:35:39,739 --> 05:35:40,880
Thank you, President Morrell.

3811
05:35:40,900 --> 05:35:55,047
I'm here as a, you know, last effort to try to, I've listened to a few of you explain where your no vote may come from, and I'm just asking you to reconsider.

3812
05:35:56,017 --> 05:36:19,220
Nina and I can both try to speak to mechanics, but if it's an assistant city solicitor, $50,000 in your legal budget, a total of $90,000 for the library, and $15,000 more for elections, we can propose to get that done so that we could have a budget for our city so that

3813
05:36:19,713 --> 05:36:23,175
the finance team and all of our directors can move forward.

3814
05:36:23,815 --> 05:36:27,077
I've apologized once for the short notice of the budget.

3815
05:36:27,657 --> 05:36:29,178
I take full responsibility.

3816
05:36:30,958 --> 05:36:35,241
It's not how I presented the last two when we did have a CFO, you all know that.

3817
05:36:36,421 --> 05:36:40,363
We can explore all options moving forward.

3818
05:36:42,124 --> 05:36:47,887
Our plan is to start the next fiscal year budget as soon as we can, including having meetings with department heads

3819
05:36:48,865 --> 05:36:53,529
in the fall to start the process and do what we have to do for this community.

3820
05:36:53,549 --> 05:37:06,381
And would this be, for clarity, would this be, I mean, obviously the library number has changed, but the other numbers you presented at the beginning of the meeting, the other recommendations, would those still be?

3821
05:37:07,061 --> 05:37:12,226
Yes, so I mentioned earlier, 40,000 for your legal budget, bought that to, you've requested 50.

3822
05:37:13,856 --> 05:37:16,518
I requested 60,000 for the library.

3823
05:37:16,538 --> 05:37:19,479
You asked for 90, we will make that happen.

3824
05:37:20,420 --> 05:37:24,442
You asked for an assistant city solicitor for 85,000.

3825
05:37:26,183 --> 05:37:43,212
I asked to keep my staff employed, so I respectfully asked for $202,087 back, as well as the legal budget, because I know President Morrell and Vice President Beers, we have talked many times about

3826
05:37:44,226 --> 05:37:49,570
the council meeting legal counsel for the comprehensive plan, housing production plan, and also the city.

3827
05:37:50,410 --> 05:37:56,655
You heard from many department heads meeting, not only Kim, probably his assistant, but KP Law.

3828
05:37:57,836 --> 05:38:01,078
And there was another- 15,000 for elections.

3829
05:38:01,098 --> 05:38:02,379
15,000 to the elections budget.

3830
05:38:02,559 --> 05:38:05,961
And I'm sorry, was there another amount related to the schools earlier?

3831
05:38:05,981 --> 05:38:12,626
The schools, 300,000 to restore positions tomorrow, and we will, in good faith, work with- Can I ask a quick, where was all this money coming from?

3832
05:38:13,544 --> 05:38:27,707
You can take this from, if you don't wanna take it from negotiated salaries, you can take it from facilities maintenance and we will have a paper before you when free cash is certified in November or December to supplement the facilities maintenance budget.

3833
05:38:29,207 --> 05:38:33,148
You could also, we could draft up a free cash paper tonight and have you vote on it tonight.

3834
05:38:33,188 --> 05:38:41,390
I know that's cleaner, but if that's not something you're willing to do because of mechanics, we will commit to putting a free cash paper before you

3835
05:38:42,245 --> 05:38:43,966
You can even set the date tonight.

3836
05:38:44,287 --> 05:38:53,574
I'd ask for probably December just to give Bob, our director, some time to catch up over the summer, to get what he needs to get done.

3837
05:38:55,535 --> 05:38:58,257
Free cash was not certified until weeks ago.

3838
05:38:58,277 --> 05:39:01,320
We will get it done on time this time.

3839
05:39:02,000 --> 05:39:02,441
Councilor Knight.

3840
05:39:02,761 --> 05:39:09,606
So it's now June 29th at 1249 in the morning.

3841
05:39:13,174 --> 05:39:18,978
This council met as a body in May and set their budget priorities.

3842
05:39:21,039 --> 05:39:25,221
That was like seven weeks ago, eight weeks ago.

3843
05:39:25,622 --> 05:39:29,344
We went through an exercise of reviewing each department's budget.

3844
05:39:29,364 --> 05:39:35,187
And when we reviewed their budget, we continued to reiterate what our priorities were.

3845
05:39:38,489 --> 05:39:42,912
We went through another exercise of going through a budget presentation

3846
05:39:45,455 --> 05:39:53,359
And now all of a sudden, at quarter one in the morning, the day before, the budget needs to be passed, we're at the table negotiating.

3847
05:39:54,900 --> 05:39:57,041
There's something fundamentally wrong with this process.

3848
05:39:58,773 --> 05:40:01,755
I take full responsibility for the lateness of this budget.

3849
05:40:02,636 --> 05:40:06,038
We didn't have free cash certified until, like I said, a couple of weeks ago.

3850
05:40:07,098 --> 05:40:09,380
Let's keep it short.

3851
05:40:09,820 --> 05:40:19,907
So now I sit here and I remember like in 2018 when at one o'clock in the morning, we took a vote about Mr. Gaff and there was outrage.

3852
05:40:20,227 --> 05:40:21,948
We're doing it in the shadow of darkness.

3853
05:40:22,869 --> 05:40:24,970
The people can't pay attention to what's going on.

3854
05:40:25,150 --> 05:40:26,171
What's the story here?

3855
05:40:26,651 --> 05:40:27,672
We should have been at the table.

3856
05:40:28,889 --> 05:40:32,333
the week after we put this council priority agenda list out.

3857
05:40:33,755 --> 05:40:45,329
And to have it be put on us now to be brought to the table to negotiate at one o'clock in the morning, literally like 46 hours before the fiscal year ends is irresponsible, I think.

3858
05:40:46,037 --> 05:40:47,939
quite frankly, we've all set it behind this rail.

3859
05:40:48,160 --> 05:40:50,322
Nobody makes good decisions after 11 o'clock at night.

3860
05:40:50,423 --> 05:40:52,906
Nobody certainly makes good decisions after a seven hour meeting.

3861
05:40:53,847 --> 05:40:55,849
And now's the time for us to start negotiating.

3862
05:40:56,430 --> 05:40:58,152
There's something fundamentally wrong with this process.

3863
05:40:58,893 --> 05:41:04,120
And I think part of it was the fact that nobody respected the council enough to think that they'd actually vote a budget down.

3864
05:41:05,764 --> 05:41:06,865
Council and I that's not true.

3865
05:41:07,006 --> 05:41:12,913
I did not have numbers of what my budget even was until the first or second week in June, that's scary.

3866
05:41:14,194 --> 05:41:20,022
So, now, for the first time, and I've been involved in metropolitan politics a long time, right, 2025 years.

3867
05:41:22,004 --> 05:41:29,669
For the first time in my life, I've actually seen seven members of the Council come together and unify around one particular issue.

3868
05:41:30,250 --> 05:41:31,050
One big issue.

3869
05:41:31,611 --> 05:41:34,433
It's something that has to tell a story, right?

3870
05:41:35,033 --> 05:41:40,257
It has to speak volumes as to the process and what went on.

3871
05:41:43,070 --> 05:41:48,573
moment on I don't think it's fair that we're sitting here or one in the morning trying to negotiate a deal to pass a budget.

3872
05:41:49,373 --> 05:41:58,158
Less than 2 days before the fiscal year closes with we were beaten down the door starting in April to stop this process we put our priorities out well in advance.

3873
05:41:59,298 --> 05:42:00,739
Well before the public has given us this.

3874
05:42:05,121 --> 05:42:05,902
So again.

3875
05:42:07,892 --> 05:42:10,454
I think that this process is fundamentally wrong.

3876
05:42:10,794 --> 05:42:13,195
The way that we're going about doing this is not transparent.

3877
05:42:15,516 --> 05:42:16,637
It's not transparent at all.

3878
05:42:16,657 --> 05:42:21,440
I mean, the taxpayers are sitting there watching this meeting for the last six hours.

3879
05:42:22,363 --> 05:42:26,406
And now all of a sudden we get everything we want after we heard we're not going to get anything.

3880
05:42:26,986 --> 05:42:29,368
I'm very confused by this process, Madam President.

3881
05:42:29,748 --> 05:42:33,691
And I, again, Madam Mayor, I give you a lot of credit for coming here and facing the beast.

3882
05:42:33,771 --> 05:42:34,291
You know what I mean?

3883
05:42:34,471 --> 05:42:34,912
Absolutely.

3884
05:42:34,932 --> 05:42:36,373
You know, you're in the belly of the beast.

3885
05:42:36,733 --> 05:42:37,213
You know what I mean?

3886
05:42:37,253 --> 05:42:39,235
You're going to hear it on the street.

3887
05:42:39,255 --> 05:42:40,275
You're going to hear it on TV.

3888
05:42:40,295 --> 05:42:41,356
You're going to hear it here.

3889
05:42:41,476 --> 05:42:42,117
You're here to hear it.

3890
05:42:42,197 --> 05:42:42,597
You know what I mean?

3891
05:42:42,617 --> 05:42:44,238
You had to face the music and I appreciate that.

3892
05:42:44,898 --> 05:42:48,801
Um, but I'm not comfortable with this process at all or the way that it's going down.

3893
05:42:50,823 --> 05:42:51,383
I'm here to try.

3894
05:42:51,854 --> 05:42:52,074
Thank you.

3895
05:42:52,174 --> 05:42:55,855
I have Councilor Collins, Councilor Scarpelli, Vice-President Behrs, Mayor Malauulu.

3896
05:42:58,415 --> 05:42:58,855
Councilor Collins.

3897
05:42:59,615 --> 05:43:00,476
Thank you, President Morrell.

3898
05:43:00,496 --> 05:43:03,236
Thank you so much, Madam Mayor, for being here.

3899
05:43:07,037 --> 05:43:15,538
Process aside, everything that's happened in the past aside, I'm happy that we're here and having this discussion, even though I think we all wish it were happening at a different time.

3900
05:43:15,558 --> 05:43:18,619
I have a question for my fellow councilors, and I have a question for you.

3901
05:43:20,747 --> 05:43:23,389
The list that you've laid out sounds good.

3902
05:43:23,809 --> 05:43:26,991
And I can hear that it reflects the priorities that we've articulated.

3903
05:43:28,192 --> 05:43:36,657
My question is what procedurally is the process that we can do right now having a budget on the agenda?

3904
05:43:36,697 --> 05:43:42,641
My understanding is we cannot make appropriations to that.

3905
05:43:43,042 --> 05:43:46,764
My understanding is amendments cannot be made to that because it's already on the table.

3906
05:43:47,845 --> 05:43:49,126
What is the process for

3907
05:43:50,417 --> 05:43:52,458
confirming these appropriations.

3908
05:43:53,499 --> 05:43:59,061
It's why I'm here instead of my chief of staff or our CFO.

3909
05:43:59,502 --> 05:44:04,824
I can make the recommendation, the request, and you can vote to amend the budget.

3910
05:44:05,344 --> 05:44:16,410
And I would ask that you amend to take this out of facilities maintenance, which is over a million dollars, and we will get a free cash paper to replenish that before you as soon as we can.

3911
05:44:18,237 --> 05:44:19,278
Thank you for that clarification.

3912
05:44:19,298 --> 05:44:19,938
I appreciate that.

3913
05:44:20,298 --> 05:44:32,906
And then my question for my counselors is, well, on the one hand, this checks a lot of my boxes, which I clearly said earlier, were red lines that I didn't feel I could cross.

3914
05:44:34,006 --> 05:44:35,307
It's late in the night.

3915
05:44:35,347 --> 05:44:36,448
A lot of people have dropped off.

3916
05:44:36,588 --> 05:44:39,830
This isn't ideal timing, but we have this before us.

3917
05:44:39,870 --> 05:44:45,893
So I'd really appreciate to hear from more members of this body about how to go forward from here.

3918
05:44:46,333 --> 05:44:47,014
Thank you again, Mayor.

3919
05:44:51,085 --> 05:44:51,865
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

3920
05:44:51,885 --> 05:44:56,208
I think that this is a step in the right direction.

3921
05:44:56,248 --> 05:45:05,672
I think that, you know, again, this is a process that I'd like for us to sit together.

3922
05:45:05,692 --> 05:45:11,015
And like I said, and I'll say it over and over again, is share the successes and work on our failures.

3923
05:45:11,655 --> 05:45:13,836
And I think that's the only way that we can be successful.

3924
05:45:16,769 --> 05:45:43,206
I made a statement from the beginning that my non-negotiables, I'll take you for your word that that's gonna be adjusted and I think that's my biggest fear was making sure that we have the representation that puts us in a position where we could make the best decisions possible for our community and having that person in place I think is gonna pay dividends.

3925
05:45:45,032 --> 05:45:51,134
I know this is very, very odd because it was a difficult process, I think.

3926
05:45:52,254 --> 05:45:53,115
We all stated that.

3927
05:45:53,135 --> 05:46:05,578
I'm not gonna keep beating that up, but at the same time, I appreciate you coming together and figuring out a way to make this happen in the last hour or so.

3928
05:46:05,598 --> 05:46:06,579
Thank you.

3929
05:46:07,199 --> 05:46:09,600
Thank you, Councilor Capelli.

3930
05:46:09,640 --> 05:46:10,300
Vice Chair Behrs.

3931
05:46:10,380 --> 05:46:11,320
Thank you, Madam President.

3932
05:46:13,281 --> 05:46:14,021
Thank you, Madam Mayor.

3933
05:46:15,002 --> 05:46:19,085
Thank you.

3934
05:46:19,105 --> 05:46:24,208
I don't think this is when or where we should be doing this, but I'm glad that we're doing it.

3935
05:46:26,270 --> 05:46:31,413
Just to clarify, basically what you're requesting is that we amend the budget to restore the 202,887 cut.

3936
05:46:31,453 --> 05:46:38,898
And then for us to accept your amendment to add 85,000 to the law full-time salaries line item,

3937
05:46:45,150 --> 05:46:52,277
90,000 to the library, would that be, what would that, so 60,000 to the salaries and 30,000 to the ordinary or?

3938
05:46:52,297 --> 05:46:54,920
I don't know.

3939
05:46:54,960 --> 05:47:01,527
I think I can just ask you to, I'm recommending that you take 90,000 out of facilities maintenance to give it to the library.

3940
05:47:01,687 --> 05:47:04,350
Let's let Director Kerr do as she may.

3941
05:47:04,510 --> 05:47:06,572
We want the library open as much as possible.

3942
05:47:07,618 --> 05:47:15,359
Okay, 15,000 to elections, and then 50,000 to legislative, professional, technical, and that's a total of 240,000?

3943
05:47:15,399 --> 05:47:19,240
That's correct, and then the 202 plus the 816.

3944
05:47:19,640 --> 05:47:22,141
You want the 816 as well, okay.

3945
05:47:25,761 --> 05:47:35,063
Do we think this may qualify for us to put out, I mean, we're scheduled to be here at six o'clock tomorrow,

3946
05:47:36,403 --> 05:47:38,764
Could we do an emergency meeting or a special meeting tomorrow?

3947
05:47:39,484 --> 05:47:40,145
We don't think so.

3948
05:47:41,726 --> 05:47:42,346
Councilor Kerrio.

3949
05:47:43,506 --> 05:48:04,396
It was gonna be my recommendation seeing that there was a late hour to, again, I don't think there's something we should do with this late hour.

3950
05:48:06,290 --> 05:48:07,492
48 hours takes us to where?

3951
05:48:08,113 --> 05:48:08,693
After June 30th.

3952
05:48:08,753 --> 05:48:11,737
If you heard Director Hunt, all of our staff are watching.

3953
05:48:11,757 --> 05:48:12,378
Is July 1 too late?

3954
05:48:12,398 --> 05:48:12,458
Yes.

3955
05:48:19,022 --> 05:48:22,445
I mean, I mean.

3956
05:48:22,665 --> 05:48:25,047
We worked so hard tonight, I asked for.

3957
05:48:25,468 --> 05:48:28,671
I appreciate all the work you've done.

3958
05:48:28,991 --> 05:48:31,513
Could we have an emergency meeting tomorrow, guys?

3959
05:48:31,954 --> 05:48:34,216
I think, I know we're kind of going off the rails right now.

3960
05:48:35,076 --> 05:48:37,018
Councilor Sang won't be available, he'll be on a plane.

3961
05:48:37,198 --> 05:48:41,682
I'll vote tonight or this morning, whatever time it is right now, just to signal that.

3962
05:48:41,702 --> 05:48:43,084
I have no problem voting.

3963
05:48:43,484 --> 05:48:43,784
Thank you.

3964
05:48:44,665 --> 05:48:44,925
Okay.

3965
05:48:48,368 --> 05:48:49,669
It's the KP law stuff too, though.

3966
05:48:49,689 --> 05:48:54,054
I just want us to be clear about that.

3967
05:48:54,074 --> 05:49:02,001
The way I'm hearing this is that we're gonna take money from facilities and give us what we're looking for, restore all the cuts that we just made, then they're gonna come and ask for more money later on.

3968
05:49:03,283 --> 05:49:09,088
No, we're gonna restore the facilities maintenance budget through free cash when free cash is certified in the fall.

3969
05:49:09,108 --> 05:49:12,492
They're gonna ask us for more money to make that appropriation, right?

3970
05:49:14,011 --> 05:49:18,434
you want more money for the budget, I can't win, Council Member.

3971
05:49:19,034 --> 05:49:20,195
I just want a financial picture.

3972
05:49:20,215 --> 05:49:26,598
I mean, because ultimately what we're doing is, in essence, we're just creating more spending down the road for later on, right?

3973
05:49:26,618 --> 05:49:28,979
So we're gonna restore the facility's budget with free cash money.

3974
05:49:29,319 --> 05:49:35,563
Which is why I made modest increases to try to get some of your requests in earlier.

3975
05:49:35,583 --> 05:49:37,964
At this point, we want a budget passed.

3976
05:49:38,765 --> 05:49:41,406
People wanna go, we have all of our staff watching.

3977
05:49:41,906 --> 05:49:43,087
We really wanna work,

3978
05:49:43,472 --> 05:49:44,833
with you to get this budget passed.

3979
05:49:44,873 --> 05:49:47,634
And we ask that you move the question and take a vote, please.

3980
05:49:47,754 --> 05:49:48,895
Vice President Behrs, thank you.

3981
05:49:48,935 --> 05:49:50,696
Vice President Behrs, you did have the floor.

3982
05:49:51,636 --> 05:49:53,117
Thank you, Madam President.

3983
05:49:57,079 --> 05:50:00,161
Again, I hate, I don't want to be doing this in open session.

3984
05:50:01,561 --> 05:50:08,965
If we were, I even feel, I got no problem with everything here except the KP law piece.

3985
05:50:09,645 --> 05:50:12,487
And I don't even have a problem with a piece of the KP law piece.

3986
05:50:15,102 --> 05:50:15,482
I don't know.

3987
05:50:17,083 --> 05:50:18,143
It's our retainer amount.

3988
05:50:18,183 --> 05:50:19,724
They do everything under our retainer.

3989
05:50:19,744 --> 05:50:24,086
It increased to 6200 a month.

3990
05:50:24,847 --> 05:50:32,430
I guess that is everything that the eight gold chiefs Tim that every department head uses because Kim's doing other things.

3991
05:50:35,312 --> 05:50:36,052
What I would ask.

3992
05:50:38,773 --> 05:50:42,695
This would make the school department help the school department.

3993
05:50:42,735 --> 05:50:43,836
This will help the library tonight.

3994
05:50:43,856 --> 05:50:44,556
We have the ability

3995
05:50:45,339 --> 05:50:51,223
to go to bed this morning, doing the right thing for the- That's 300,000 too, sorry.

3996
05:50:51,263 --> 05:50:52,043
Yes, 300,000.

3997
05:50:52,463 --> 05:50:57,906
So what we're doing is taking 540,000 from facilities maintenance?

3998
05:50:57,927 --> 05:51:06,452
240, I was gonna use ARPA for the 300,000, because they're positions that can be restored through ARPA that we can give, we can send them notices, these five positions tomorrow.

3999
05:51:07,912 --> 05:51:09,854
We don't wanna lose these people.

4000
05:51:10,214 --> 05:51:11,935
Look, I don't wanna look a gift horse in the mouth here.

4001
05:51:14,619 --> 05:51:17,900
And I feel like I just don't want to end up back here.

4002
05:51:18,280 --> 05:51:20,860
I really don't when we're doing the next budget.

4003
05:51:20,980 --> 05:51:21,480
We will do better.

4004
05:51:21,900 --> 05:51:22,201
Okay.

4005
05:51:22,861 --> 05:51:25,881
I really cross my fingers here.

4006
05:51:26,941 --> 05:51:28,182
I'm taking a leap of faith here.

4007
05:51:28,202 --> 05:51:31,962
I'm willing to do that.

4008
05:51:32,142 --> 05:51:32,422
Thank you.

4009
05:51:32,622 --> 05:51:35,383
But if I get fried again, you won't.

4010
05:51:35,783 --> 05:51:36,603
I really hope not.

4011
05:51:36,903 --> 05:51:38,583
And he's gonna kill me.

4012
05:51:44,942 --> 05:51:51,084
Yeah, okay, I'll motion.

4013
05:51:53,104 --> 05:51:56,085
All right, I'll wait for him to finish then I'll motion.

4014
05:51:56,265 --> 05:52:04,808
Madam Mayor, where does this put the teacher negotiations?

4015
05:52:07,488 --> 05:52:08,949
Teacher negotiations, I believe,

4016
05:52:10,989 --> 05:52:15,991
I don't know, Dave, it's irrelevant to the budget as it relates to negotiations.

4017
05:52:16,011 --> 05:52:18,993
We have about 20 contracts that we're working on to settle.

4018
05:52:23,295 --> 05:52:30,679
So a yes vote on the budget will not have a direct impact on our negotiations, but we will continue to bargain.

4019
05:52:32,583 --> 05:52:32,823
I'm sorry.

4020
05:52:32,843 --> 05:52:35,625
So, yes, for what is what is it for the teachers on their race, they're looking for it.

4021
05:52:41,895 --> 05:52:55,366
Councilor Cabello, as I said, we are not going to negotiate collective bargaining agreements for the teachers or any of the other valuable collective bargaining partners that we have in public forum.

4022
05:52:56,327 --> 05:53:00,751
You just asked to cover a race I know I just asked, where does that put them.

4023
05:53:01,852 --> 05:53:02,212
What is it.

4024
05:53:05,196 --> 05:53:21,448
We're going to continue to engage in good faith bargaining with all of our bargaining partners, including the teachers, and approval of this budget, as I said earlier, will give us the stability that we need to put us in a position to restore as many positions as possible, as quickly as possible.

4025
05:53:22,068 --> 05:53:27,172
And I would join the mayor, chief of staff, the superintendent, and everyone else who has urged you to please pass this budget.

4026
05:53:27,272 --> 05:53:27,592
Thank you.

4027
05:53:29,173 --> 05:53:29,473
Thank you.

4028
05:53:31,114 --> 05:53:31,555
Councilor Sang.

4029
05:53:32,006 --> 05:53:33,187
It's one I'll keep it simple.

4030
05:53:33,227 --> 05:53:34,088
Thank you for coming back.

4031
05:53:34,168 --> 05:53:35,008
And thank you for listening.

4032
05:53:35,489 --> 05:53:35,789
Thank you.

4033
05:53:36,490 --> 05:53:36,770
Thank you.

4034
05:53:38,511 --> 05:53:39,512
Okay, thank you.

4035
05:53:40,493 --> 05:53:41,053
And I'll be brief.

4036
05:53:41,994 --> 05:53:48,940
Oh, no, that's the only thing I can do is I try to be as much a straight shooter as I can be.

4037
05:53:49,220 --> 05:53:55,365
We asked for these things, perhaps in a way of, you know, a way to get attention, and you're delivering and

4038
05:53:56,280 --> 05:53:58,241
I can only act in good faith on what you're promising.

4039
05:53:58,601 --> 05:54:03,082
I have been burned a little bit before that's brought us here, but I'm gonna act in good faith.

4040
05:54:03,322 --> 05:54:11,745
And I know so often here, we'll reference our family sometimes, but we don't reference the fact of the hours and hours we're away from our family.

4041
05:54:12,065 --> 05:54:18,167
And I've been looking at my phone all night because I have a very unhappy six month old that I want nothing more than to be with right now.

4042
05:54:19,348 --> 05:54:23,169
But to get to a budget that we've been fighting for for months,

4043
05:54:24,383 --> 05:54:40,533
and hours, and what feels like months in this very meeting, that I can go home, and I know he's six months old, but that I can go home and say that we fought for something, and we got what we asked for, and we got what our residents asked for, and we got what the people deserve, and the mayor came to the table.

4044
05:54:41,334 --> 05:54:44,496
That feels so much better than going home at 1 a.m.

4045
05:54:44,516 --> 05:54:47,958
and saying, yes, I have no idea what's gonna happen next.

4046
05:54:48,896 --> 05:54:49,597
So I thank you.

4047
05:54:50,358 --> 05:55:02,734
Again, I wish this timeline happened over the past several months as opposed to the past several hours, but I appreciate you acting in good faith and coming with these numbers to support our city and support what we've heard from residents.

4048
05:55:03,234 --> 05:55:03,675
So thank you.

4049
05:55:08,818 --> 05:55:20,865
I do want to know any motions just as far as the clerk was noting that it would probably be easier to reconsider cuts rather than trying to do a lot of different moves.

4050
05:55:22,046 --> 05:55:22,746
Councilor, I'm sorry.

4051
05:55:22,846 --> 05:55:23,587
Councilor, sorry.

4052
05:55:23,607 --> 05:55:24,267
This is embarrassing.

4053
05:55:24,327 --> 05:55:25,088
No, no, sorry.

4054
05:55:25,128 --> 05:55:26,108
I'm sorry to yeah, yeah you.

4055
05:55:26,168 --> 05:55:26,708
What am I doing?

4056
05:55:28,169 --> 05:55:28,950
It's too late.

4057
05:55:28,970 --> 05:55:30,010
You did yeah, yeah.

4058
05:55:30,371 --> 05:55:30,651
I know.

4059
05:55:30,671 --> 05:55:30,751
Wow.

4060
05:55:35,218 --> 05:55:35,618
You're right.

4061
05:55:36,038 --> 05:55:37,119
And he's right.

4062
05:55:39,800 --> 05:55:41,721
I just want to be really clear about what this is.

4063
05:55:44,142 --> 05:55:50,605
And because we're doing it and I'm to be quite honest, I need a little extra time to think this through at this time.

4064
05:55:52,266 --> 05:56:00,790
So basically the request is we would reconsider the cuts to the executive salaries and KP law.

4065
05:56:02,735 --> 05:56:08,480
we would motion to accept your amendments to take 240- Recommendations.

4066
05:56:08,840 --> 05:56:18,248
Recommendations, sorry, to take 240,000, and again, these aren't motions yet, I'm just saying it aloud, to take 240,000 from facilities maintenance and allocate 85,000 to law salaries, 90,000 to the library, 15,000 to elections, and 50,000 to legislative.

4067
05:56:18,288 --> 05:56:19,609
That's correct.

4068
05:56:31,040 --> 05:56:37,963
Then we would motion to accept your recommendation to add 300,000 more to the Medford Public Schools from ARPA.

4069
05:56:39,444 --> 05:56:39,844
That's correct.

4070
05:56:40,184 --> 05:56:40,524
Okay.

4071
05:56:43,246 --> 05:56:46,807
There's two things I'd like to ask.

4072
05:56:47,027 --> 05:56:52,650
One, just to clarify, and I know Mr. Murphy came up and quite frankly, it just didn't sit in my head exactly right.

4073
05:56:53,670 --> 05:56:54,731
What does that 300,000 do in real terms?

4074
05:56:58,215 --> 05:57:03,677
Yes, I left the paper at the office, the five full-time positions it will restore tomorrow.

4075
05:57:05,678 --> 05:57:13,461
So what I said is that it will allow us to restore as many positions as possible as quickly as possible.

4076
05:57:14,121 --> 05:57:23,225
It is not the case that it will lead to the immediate restoration of all budget-related non-renewals, although it would be my, it will be a

4077
05:57:24,225 --> 05:57:26,487
it will accelerate that process considerably.

4078
05:57:26,507 --> 05:57:42,516
And it will be my hope that as we continue to analyze where we are with respect to our FY23 financial position, taking into account things like retirements, resignations, and whatnot, that that's the analysis that we have to go through to restore all of the positions that we want to restore.

4079
05:57:42,976 --> 05:57:48,520
This will give us a substantial head start in that and allow us to do a much faster timeline

4080
05:57:49,000 --> 05:58:06,515
to which as the mayor alluded to earlier, given that we are now in a race against the clock with respect to wanting to retain that educator talent, it is an imperative from the school department's perspective that the budget both be passed and that $300,000 that the mayor's recommended be included.

4081
05:58:07,876 --> 05:58:08,176
Okay.

4082
05:58:10,198 --> 05:58:10,578
Thank you.

4083
05:58:10,598 --> 05:58:12,099
That makes sense to me.

4084
05:58:12,119 --> 05:58:14,321
And then the other thing I want to ask- Thank you.

4085
05:58:14,862 --> 05:58:16,323
Regarding the assistant city solicitor,

4086
05:58:17,330 --> 05:58:29,213
Would you be willing to put in the job description that up to half of the time or 20 hours a week or however you want to do it would be devoted to working with the council if we needed that time in a given week?

4087
05:58:31,774 --> 05:58:34,595
Yeah, I think that's along the lines of what I

4088
05:58:36,432 --> 05:58:43,654
brought up at the last budget that KP Law and Kim would coordinate to always have an attorney before you.

4089
05:58:43,874 --> 05:58:50,036
So I think we can make sure that an assistant spends some dedicated time with the council.

4090
05:58:50,376 --> 05:58:53,177
We say up to half the time, up to 20 hours a week if needed.

4091
05:58:53,477 --> 05:58:56,518
Can we?

4092
05:58:56,538 --> 05:58:57,899
One information on that.

4093
05:58:57,959 --> 05:58:58,619
Councilor Knight.

4094
05:58:58,719 --> 05:58:59,459
It doesn't matter.

4095
05:58:59,559 --> 05:59:02,020
We can just make an ordinance that says 20 hours a week would be.

4096
05:59:02,490 --> 05:59:04,170
dedicated 35 hour work week.

4097
05:59:04,190 --> 05:59:10,931
So okay, 17 and a half.

4098
05:59:11,892 --> 05:59:13,072
My question is, when's it going to be filled?

4099
05:59:13,272 --> 05:59:14,852
I mean, we can say, Oh, yeah, sounds good to me.

4100
05:59:14,872 --> 05:59:19,033
And then, you know, January, February, March, we still wait for the position to be posted.

4101
05:59:19,053 --> 05:59:23,194
So I think I think we have to we have to post building in it.

4102
05:59:23,574 --> 05:59:25,034
So this will come after that.

4103
05:59:26,414 --> 05:59:31,435
Those are could you give us a date certain when the posting will be completed?

4104
05:59:32,018 --> 05:59:32,558
Two to three months.

4105
05:59:33,759 --> 05:59:35,461
The posting or the hiring?

4106
05:59:36,542 --> 05:59:40,345
We'll try to do both, but I don't know for certain, because we want to see what candidates we bring in.

4107
05:59:43,007 --> 05:59:44,549
So, I mean, when would it be posted?

4108
05:59:48,512 --> 05:59:49,533
Yes, two months max.

4109
05:59:49,553 --> 05:59:51,655
September 1 at the latest?

4110
05:59:53,116 --> 05:59:54,597
I'm just, I want to flush this out.

4111
05:59:55,238 --> 05:59:55,558
September 1.

4112
05:59:59,688 --> 06:00:04,472
I'll reserve motions for one more second to see if anyone else has any questions at this point.

4113
06:00:07,874 --> 06:00:09,496
Any other further discussion from the council?

4114
06:00:10,416 --> 06:00:16,161
I'm assuming that the mayor would maintain her position as the appointing authority relative to the assistant city solicitors position?

4115
06:00:16,361 --> 06:00:16,641
Yes.

4116
06:00:18,102 --> 06:00:18,302
Yes.

4117
06:00:21,645 --> 06:00:22,686
Any further questions from the council?

4118
06:00:23,291 --> 06:00:34,603
member of the council to be able to serve on the selection committee considering that or the city clerk therefore even with the person to be working in the council on the selection committee as they go through the process.

4119
06:00:36,545 --> 06:00:44,614
Yes, I can definitely think through that I know console Carviel said on our in our veteran interviews, we have councils helping us

4120
06:00:45,077 --> 06:00:46,737
the solid waste task force.

4121
06:00:46,757 --> 06:00:53,859
So let me think through that, but I don't see a problem of having a counselor involved in one or one of the two or three interviews.

4122
06:00:53,879 --> 06:00:55,880
How's this any different than the veterans office, right?

4123
06:00:56,420 --> 06:00:56,780
Okay.

4124
06:00:59,021 --> 06:01:02,162
You can consult with the council leadership.

4125
06:01:04,422 --> 06:01:07,223
I am not around during the day.

4126
06:01:09,164 --> 06:01:10,064
Motion for approval then?

4127
06:01:10,884 --> 06:01:14,105
I would motion to reconsider, well,

4128
06:01:16,413 --> 06:01:21,156
the winning side has a motion to reconsider the recommendations first, okay.

4129
06:01:24,899 --> 06:01:27,100
Oh yeah, can we get a key to these boxes please?

4130
06:01:27,201 --> 06:01:28,521
I know we asked for it two weeks ago.

4131
06:01:28,542 --> 06:01:29,702
Okay, we'll work on that.

4132
06:01:29,782 --> 06:01:32,084
I have sent an email on that, I will follow up.

4133
06:01:32,324 --> 06:01:33,085
That's a good point.

4134
06:01:33,305 --> 06:01:34,225
What else?

4135
06:01:34,446 --> 06:01:38,228
Does anybody need me to walk their dog tomorrow?

4136
06:01:40,510 --> 06:01:44,773
Okay, motion to accept the mayor's recommendation

4137
06:01:45,455 --> 06:01:53,857
to reallocate 240,000 from facilities maintenance to reallocate it to 85,000 to the law department.

4138
06:01:53,877 --> 06:02:04,641
I'm just gonna add the words from facilities maintenance in the ordinary expense line.

4139
06:02:04,981 --> 06:02:07,841
Okay, we should work with the clerk really, I think, yeah.

4140
06:02:11,422 --> 06:02:13,283
We'll work with the technical language, yeah.

4141
06:02:14,649 --> 06:02:17,250
Yeah, we'll get to it, then we'll reread it, then we'll make corrections if needed.

4142
06:02:17,270 --> 06:02:31,955
To move, yeah, so 240,000 from facility maintenance ordinary to 85,000 to the law department permanent full-time salaries.

4143
06:02:35,396 --> 06:02:36,657
And I'll give the clerk some time here.

4144
06:02:43,089 --> 06:02:44,550
90,000 to the library.

4145
06:02:47,411 --> 06:02:55,035
And I would just propose that it go into salaries for simplicity of a transfer year and needed to be done.

4146
06:02:55,055 --> 06:02:57,356
We would come before the council.

4147
06:02:57,416 --> 06:02:57,776
Okay.

4148
06:02:57,796 --> 06:03:00,777
90,000 into library salaries.

4149
06:03:00,797 --> 06:03:08,721
15,000 into elections, full-time salaries.

4150
06:03:08,821 --> 06:03:10,082
Is that the easiest place?

4151
06:03:11,492 --> 06:03:14,854
I think expenses probably because I'm assuming it's covering expenses.

4152
06:03:15,074 --> 06:03:15,334
Okay.

4153
06:03:15,535 --> 06:03:15,755
Yep.

4154
06:03:15,775 --> 06:03:35,666
Uh, so which line would that be or just ordinary elections, ordinary 15,000 and then 50,000 to legislative professional and technical services.

4155
06:03:38,767 --> 06:03:38,887
Yep.

4156
06:03:38,987 --> 06:03:40,108
And that would be expenses as well.

4157
06:03:40,712 --> 06:03:42,473
just for in ordinary expenses.

4158
06:03:42,533 --> 06:03:51,717
Yeah.

4159
06:03:51,857 --> 06:03:53,437
Yes, please read that back.

4160
06:03:53,638 --> 06:03:56,419
That's Yeah, I think we do them each separately.

4161
06:03:56,699 --> 06:03:56,819
Yep.

4162
06:04:09,629 --> 06:04:12,431
That's on right, Madam Chief of Staff.

4163
06:04:34,340 --> 06:04:39,222
Yes, I just want to confirm that at the beginning, we talked about facilities expense line.

4164
06:04:39,242 --> 06:04:45,405
I just want to make sure this is clean and... Facilities, maintenance, ordinary expenses, I think is what he said.

4165
06:04:45,425 --> 06:04:45,825
Okay, perfect.

4166
06:04:45,965 --> 06:04:46,526
I missed that part.

4167
06:04:46,566 --> 06:04:46,866
Thank you.

4168
06:04:47,026 --> 06:04:47,366
Okay.

4169
06:04:49,187 --> 06:04:54,870
And whereas there are people still here, I would like to give people an opportunity to speak to this as it's unexpected.

4170
06:04:54,890 --> 06:04:58,471
Is there anyone on Zoom or in the chambers?

4171
06:04:58,491 --> 06:04:59,012
No, President Dahl.

4172
06:04:59,052 --> 06:04:59,552
Councilor Knight.

4173
06:05:00,962 --> 06:05:17,117
We, we also talked a little bit about the work that I videographer does the amount of hours that he puts in the fact that, you know, his salary, that position hasn't changed in terms of stipend for now, as long as I can remember.

4174
06:05:17,957 --> 06:05:29,028
but where we've made such a move to the hybrid version of meetings and the like, I'd like to see some sort of a cost of living adjustment or a salary adjustment to the videographer.

4175
06:05:29,088 --> 06:05:32,591
And if we look at my budget here, we do a purchase of videographer services.

4176
06:05:34,553 --> 06:05:42,621
And I'm hoping the city clerk can tell me whether or not 5202 would be the videographer services that we utilize for Shane.

4177
06:05:49,282 --> 06:05:51,997
Yes, there's more than enough money in there to raise his salary.

4178
06:05:57,208 --> 06:06:02,953
The way I see it, the kid barely makes minimum wage the way these meetings go.

4179
06:06:03,914 --> 06:06:12,500
So I'd like to maybe revisit this and maybe make that an hourly position as opposed to having to be a monthly stipend position.

4180
06:06:12,821 --> 06:06:15,102
Because right now I think he's getting $300 a month.

4181
06:06:16,083 --> 06:06:21,808
And quite frankly, you couldn't pay me $300 to do what he did tonight sitting in that room in the back over there listening to this.

4182
06:06:22,328 --> 06:06:25,249
So, you know, ultimately, this needs to be rectified.

4183
06:06:25,269 --> 06:06:26,309
It's something we need to address.

4184
06:06:26,669 --> 06:06:28,090
I don't think this is going to be a budget break.

4185
06:06:28,130 --> 06:06:29,230
It's not going to be one to hold us up.

4186
06:06:29,590 --> 06:06:39,693
But moving forward, I'd also like to get a commitment from the administration that they'd be willing to work with us on getting a videographer a more suitable wage than what is being compensated at right now.

4187
06:06:39,713 --> 06:06:40,773
Thank you, Councillor Knight.

4188
06:06:40,813 --> 06:06:42,294
Mr. Clerk, is this current rate 350 a month?

4189
06:06:49,887 --> 06:06:54,893
Okay, so I do not see anyone on Zoom or in the chambers who has stood to speak on this.

4190
06:06:55,114 --> 06:06:56,976
We actually have a hand raised.

4191
06:07:00,000 --> 06:07:01,042
Thank you, Vice President Behrs.

4192
06:07:01,082 --> 06:07:03,305
I can't, out of my scope of vision.

4193
06:07:09,374 --> 06:07:12,475
Hi, Molly Kibbe, 9 Medford Street, Somerville.

4194
06:07:12,555 --> 06:07:23,679
I was just wondering where the 300,000 for the teacher salaries, where that is coming from out of ARPA, if that could be clarified just for my records for management.

4195
06:07:24,019 --> 06:07:25,679
That's the next item, we're not there yet.

4196
06:07:25,919 --> 06:07:26,179
Okay.

4197
06:07:26,219 --> 06:07:26,560
Sorry.

4198
06:07:26,800 --> 06:07:27,140
Sorry.

4199
06:07:27,480 --> 06:07:29,180
No, I apologize.

4200
06:07:30,061 --> 06:07:32,321
So on the motion, do any councilors need that?

4201
06:07:32,542 --> 06:07:33,102
Vice President Baird.

4202
06:07:34,268 --> 06:07:37,629
On the request of Councillor Knight, could we have the Chief of Staff commit to that?

4203
06:07:38,050 --> 06:07:40,731
Madam Chief of Staff, I don't know if you were able to hear any of that.

4204
06:07:40,771 --> 06:07:48,674
Councillor Knight's request to just continue conversation to turn our videographer position to an hourly rate to better reflect the amount of work that's done.

4205
06:07:48,694 --> 06:07:49,815
Or a better stipend.

4206
06:07:50,235 --> 06:07:51,916
Or a better stipend, particularly for nights like this.

4207
06:07:53,516 --> 06:07:58,178
As far as the amount, and we have increased that amount.

4208
06:07:58,198 --> 06:08:00,159
I vaguely remember

4209
06:08:02,760 --> 06:08:06,283
Mr. Colbert is paid $350 per month at this point in time, correct?

4210
06:08:06,984 --> 06:08:07,124
Yes.

4211
06:08:07,404 --> 06:08:09,466
And so I know we've gone up on that number.

4212
06:08:09,486 --> 06:08:14,852
I would need to refer to another piece of paper that I have as to whether that's exactly where that is.

4213
06:08:14,972 --> 06:08:23,140
I don't believe we made it all the way where the City Council is looking to go in their request, simply because we're trying to balance a number of different things.

4214
06:08:23,180 --> 06:08:24,541
And while this is small,

4215
06:08:25,762 --> 06:08:39,850
and I don't mean to say Mr. Colbert's impact is small potatoes by any means, but in terms of actual bottom line dollar monetary impacts, the reality of the situation is we're just trying to be equitable across the board.

4216
06:08:39,910 --> 06:08:42,832
So I know we've made a modification to that.

4217
06:08:43,612 --> 06:08:44,993
I just don't remember the exact number.

4218
06:08:45,133 --> 06:08:48,815
I'm happy to go refer to my document and be right back in two seconds.

4219
06:08:50,056 --> 06:08:50,676
What did we go to?

4220
06:08:52,717 --> 06:08:54,398
Went to four, can we go to five instead?

4221
06:08:54,910 --> 06:08:56,451
So I mean, if he does eight meetings, right?

4222
06:08:56,471 --> 06:08:57,452
500 bucks.

4223
06:08:57,972 --> 06:08:59,413
I'll just be able to tell you what's in the budget.

4224
06:08:59,733 --> 06:09:04,957
I'm not, I don't have the authority under mass general law to modify budgetary numbers.

4225
06:09:05,417 --> 06:09:08,939
The more than four, it's not actually a budget question.

4226
06:09:09,420 --> 06:09:13,803
The good Lord, I can't believe we're here.

4227
06:09:15,324 --> 06:09:17,545
Legislative page 80.

4228
06:09:18,666 --> 06:09:22,629
There's more than enough money to pay that rate to Mr. Colbert within the budget.

4229
06:09:23,189 --> 06:09:23,569
We budget 9,600.

4230
06:09:29,259 --> 06:09:31,640
350, I mean, I just can't do that math in my head at this point.

4231
06:09:31,660 --> 06:09:33,501
350 times 12 is 4,200, 500 times 12 would be 6,000.

4232
06:09:33,581 --> 06:09:34,321
So we'd still be 3,600 short.

4233
06:09:34,341 --> 06:09:37,443
That doesn't come out of that, that comes out of a different line.

4234
06:09:37,483 --> 06:09:39,804
So, you know, we have 9,600 budget, 9,600 budgeted, $500 a month would be 6,000.

4235
06:09:53,821 --> 06:09:56,402
It's really not my place to bind anything on this matter.

4236
06:09:56,462 --> 06:10:03,023
I don't have the authority, but I'm happy to recommend that we have further discussions on it, and I have no objection to it if that's helpful.

4237
06:10:03,524 --> 06:10:04,724
Okay, are you good with that?

4238
06:10:05,704 --> 06:10:07,885
All right.

4239
06:10:11,426 --> 06:10:14,106
Believe me, I think, yeah, I mean, it's evident.

4240
06:10:14,987 --> 06:10:16,247
Yeah, this meeting alone is worth 350 bucks.

4241
06:10:16,267 --> 06:10:16,587
To, yeah, to...

4242
06:10:20,950 --> 06:10:25,052
Do you want a motion around that or it's just the verbal commitment enough at this point?

4243
06:10:25,372 --> 06:10:28,994
Okay.

4244
06:10:29,034 --> 06:10:31,416
We're about an hour and a half into a brand new day.

4245
06:10:31,936 --> 06:10:33,717
On the motion, could you read it back one more time?

4246
06:10:34,017 --> 06:10:34,317
Please.

4247
06:10:34,797 --> 06:10:35,338
If you could Mr. Clerk.

4248
06:10:50,039 --> 06:10:50,840
your microphone.

4249
06:10:54,783 --> 06:10:57,706
Take that $240,000 and break it down as follows.

4250
06:10:58,287 --> 06:11:02,631
Move $85,000 to the law department permanent full-time salaries.

4251
06:11:03,952 --> 06:11:06,214
Take $90,000 and move it to library salaries.

4252
06:11:08,336 --> 06:11:15,863
$15,000 to the elections ordinary expenses and $50,000 to the legislative professional and technical services line.

4253
06:11:20,240 --> 06:11:25,721
On the motion of Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Carvajal, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

4254
06:11:27,942 --> 06:11:28,802
Vice President Behrs?

4255
06:11:29,182 --> 06:11:29,522
Yes.

4256
06:11:30,102 --> 06:11:30,902
Councilor Caravajal?

4257
06:11:30,942 --> 06:11:31,162
Yes.

4258
06:11:32,262 --> 06:11:32,963
Councilor Collins?

4259
06:11:33,103 --> 06:11:33,403
Yes.

4260
06:11:34,143 --> 06:11:34,683
Councilor Knight?

4261
06:11:34,823 --> 06:11:35,063
Yes.

4262
06:11:35,883 --> 06:11:36,703
Councilor Scarpelli?

4263
06:11:36,943 --> 06:11:37,203
Yes.

4264
06:11:37,864 --> 06:11:38,504
Councilor Sang?

4265
06:11:38,544 --> 06:11:38,764
Yes.

4266
06:11:39,564 --> 06:11:40,204
President Morrell?

4267
06:11:40,764 --> 06:11:41,004
Yes.

4268
06:11:41,064 --> 06:11:42,585
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

4269
06:11:42,625 --> 06:11:43,745
The motion passes.

4270
06:11:45,025 --> 06:11:49,366
Motion to accept the Mayor's recommendation and need

4271
06:11:50,518 --> 06:11:51,880
Just let me know if I say anything wrong.

4272
06:11:52,981 --> 06:11:55,203
Madam Chief of Staff, let me know if I say anything wrong.

4273
06:11:56,203 --> 06:12:03,530
Motion to accept the Mayor's recommendation to allocate $300,000 to the Medford Public Schools.

4274
06:12:05,112 --> 06:12:13,119
Do we need to, from ARPA, and then Manager Kivey was saying we should probably have a purpose for that.

4275
06:12:13,199 --> 06:12:14,260
Do you have language for that?

4276
06:12:14,865 --> 06:12:17,246
I mean, at this point, we need to review options.

4277
06:12:17,286 --> 06:12:21,947
There's a variety of options that could be utilized for this purpose.

4278
06:12:22,027 --> 06:12:25,829
So we could go through the process, but we'd have to work with Ms.

4279
06:12:25,869 --> 06:12:26,889
Kivy, and I'm assuming Ms.

4280
06:12:26,909 --> 06:12:28,430
Kivy wouldn't have these answers right now.

4281
06:12:28,470 --> 06:12:39,933
We'd have to go through the specific jobs, what those specific jobs functions are, whether they qualify directly under ARPA in accordance with the ARPA guidance.

4282
06:12:40,093 --> 06:12:40,874
I'll make it simple.

4283
06:12:42,507 --> 06:12:56,455
If that doesn't, if any of those don't pass that merit test, then we could pursue utilizing another calculation that we have learned about with regard to full-time equivalents in prior years and calculating them.

4284
06:12:56,935 --> 06:13:03,959
And if finally none of those work for any reason, then we could go to use unallocated ARPA revenue loss.

4285
06:13:04,099 --> 06:13:10,983
So there are a variety of different steps that we need to take to determine which bucket this will fall into, but I assume that can't be determined this evening.

4286
06:13:13,618 --> 06:13:14,479
Are we okay with that?

4287
06:13:16,980 --> 06:13:20,022
Okay, on the motion to, could you read back the motion, Mr. Clerk?

4288
06:13:21,123 --> 06:13:21,823
Go ahead.

4289
06:13:21,923 --> 06:13:23,544
What happens if there is no bucket?

4290
06:13:24,905 --> 06:13:32,930
President Morrell, there would be a bucket ultimately because there is available dollars remaining in ARPA revenue loss that hasn't been allocated.

4291
06:13:32,990 --> 06:13:40,495
Not for fiscal 23, allow me to be very clear about that, but there is from prior year.

4292
06:13:44,013 --> 06:13:51,337
Again, this is a budget that we need to move forward and make sustainable, but we're doing our best.

4293
06:13:52,038 --> 06:13:59,022
We want to use the mechanics of ARPA to the degree that it's helpful for our process.

4294
06:13:59,782 --> 06:14:02,364
Just like the CPA, there are buckets that you can use it for, right?

4295
06:14:02,744 --> 06:14:08,127
We're saying that there's $300,000 in ARPA funds that we know that we can use for this purpose.

4296
06:14:08,167 --> 06:14:10,869
We just have to make sure that we figure out what bucket that is.

4297
06:14:10,889 --> 06:14:13,070
I think that's a reasonable statement.

4298
06:14:14,610 --> 06:14:24,998
And then just out of curiosity, if that money was there previously, and we were talking about the school budget for six hours, how come we didn't grab that money a long time ago and put that on the table?

4299
06:14:25,098 --> 06:14:27,380
And we probably would've got this conversation short by three hours.

4300
06:14:27,940 --> 06:14:28,741
But that's a whole different story.

4301
06:14:28,761 --> 06:14:31,803
That was actually referenced in the beginning of the meeting, that amount of money was.

4302
06:14:32,704 --> 06:14:33,384
Okay, thank you.

4303
06:14:34,145 --> 06:14:37,867
I'm just embarrassed if I could know, I'm still chairing just for, I know we're all tired, but.

4304
06:14:38,088 --> 06:14:38,388
Sorry.

4305
06:14:38,428 --> 06:14:39,529
You were calling on Councilor Nights.

4306
06:14:39,589 --> 06:14:41,070
Yeah, sorry.

4307
06:14:41,470 --> 06:14:43,391
So I do have a motion on the floor for the $300,000

4308
06:14:44,709 --> 06:14:47,812
Motion from Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Sang.

4309
06:14:47,912 --> 06:14:49,473
Mr. Clerk, if you could read back the language.

4310
06:14:50,053 --> 06:14:50,334
Sure.

4311
06:14:51,335 --> 06:14:58,661
Vice President Behrs moved to accept the Mayor's recommendation to reallocate $300,000 from ARPA to the Medford Public Schools.

4312
06:15:00,362 --> 06:15:01,063
Madam President.

4313
06:15:01,083 --> 06:15:02,143
Vice President Behrs.

4314
06:15:02,604 --> 06:15:08,048
Could we just, as we did on the previous item, allow for any members of the public who would want to speak?

4315
06:15:08,068 --> 06:15:11,912
Is there any members of the public who would like to speak on this reallocation?

4316
06:15:14,997 --> 06:15:37,447
I'm assuming that based on the mayor's recommendation that her recommendation was essentially that, just to make sure we're all on the same page, her recommendation was that we would make these modifications with the idea that the full budget would be voted as presented with the exception of the adjustments that were made upon her recommendation and the City Council's amendment.

4317
06:15:37,527 --> 06:15:38,087
Is that correct?

4318
06:15:39,455 --> 06:15:40,035
Sounds right.

4319
06:15:40,356 --> 06:15:43,338
Yes, so we're just reconfirmed the other executives.

4320
06:15:43,418 --> 06:15:48,742
The expense line for the law budget would include the presented value on this paper.

4321
06:15:49,262 --> 06:15:51,464
Yes, the plan is that any votes we have to reconsider.

4322
06:15:51,484 --> 06:15:52,064
Thank you very much.

4323
06:15:52,084 --> 06:15:53,826
We take this will reconsider those votes.

4324
06:15:53,986 --> 06:15:54,266
Thank you.

4325
06:15:54,286 --> 06:15:55,407
There is a motion on the floor to do so.

4326
06:15:55,427 --> 06:15:55,747
Thank you.

4327
06:15:57,649 --> 06:16:00,971
So on the motion of Vice Mayor seconded by Councilor saying Mr Clerk, please call the roll.

4328
06:16:02,492 --> 06:16:03,193
Vice President bears.

4329
06:16:03,453 --> 06:16:03,753
Yes.

4330
06:16:05,034 --> 06:16:05,775
Council carry on.

4331
06:16:05,895 --> 06:16:05,995
Yes.

4332
06:16:06,870 --> 06:16:07,550
Councilor Collins?

4333
06:16:07,690 --> 06:16:07,910
Yes.

4334
06:16:08,790 --> 06:16:09,371
Councilor Knight?

4335
06:16:11,291 --> 06:16:12,131
Absent from the chamber.

4336
06:16:13,251 --> 06:16:13,972
Councilor Scarpelli?

4337
06:16:13,992 --> 06:16:14,112
Yes.

4338
06:16:15,272 --> 06:16:15,912
Councilor Sang?

4339
06:16:15,972 --> 06:16:16,172
Yes.

4340
06:16:16,752 --> 06:16:17,352
President Morrell?

4341
06:16:18,032 --> 06:16:18,232
Yes.

4342
06:16:18,592 --> 06:16:21,533
Six in affirmative, one absent, the motion passes.

4343
06:16:23,394 --> 06:16:28,735
Motion to reconsider the vote taken to cut line item 0101515302.

4344
06:16:28,815 --> 06:16:30,395
That was the cut to the law.

4345
06:16:35,392 --> 06:16:36,573
professional services of $81,600.

4346
06:16:36,893 --> 06:16:44,219
On the motion of Vice Mayor Behrs to reconsider that cut to the law services, seconded by Councilor Sang.

4347
06:16:44,239 --> 06:16:48,683
Mr. Clerk, please call the, I think that's a roll call.

4348
06:16:48,703 --> 06:16:49,343
Please call the roll.

4349
06:16:50,244 --> 06:17:03,355
And I got to do a slip.

4350
06:17:03,695 --> 06:17:04,436
Not three hours.

4351
06:17:10,641 --> 06:17:12,482
Okay, this is the motion to reconsider.

4352
06:17:15,044 --> 06:17:20,468
On the 81,600 that was cut from the budget that was amount paid to KP Law.

4353
06:17:21,169 --> 06:17:22,750
This is just the motion to reconsider at this point.

4354
06:17:23,370 --> 06:17:24,191
Vice President Behrs?

4355
06:17:24,291 --> 06:17:24,631
Yes.

4356
06:17:25,612 --> 06:17:26,052
Councilor Kerrio?

4357
06:17:26,092 --> 06:17:26,312
Yes.

4358
06:17:27,613 --> 06:17:28,214
Councilor Collins?

4359
06:17:28,294 --> 06:17:28,534
Yes.

4360
06:17:29,174 --> 06:17:29,695
Councilor Knight?

4361
06:17:29,815 --> 06:17:30,135
Yes.

4362
06:17:30,996 --> 06:17:31,696
Councilor Scarpelli?

4363
06:17:31,896 --> 06:17:32,097
Yes.

4364
06:17:33,137 --> 06:17:33,678
Councilor Sang?

4365
06:17:34,258 --> 06:17:34,458
Yes.

4366
06:17:34,999 --> 06:17:35,539
President Morrell?

4367
06:17:35,739 --> 06:17:37,901
Yes, I'm in favor, I was hearing the negative, the motion passes.

4368
06:17:41,218 --> 06:17:44,800
a motion to restore the amount or Councilor Collins?

4369
06:17:44,820 --> 06:17:48,621
I think we actually would motion to reject.

4370
06:17:51,482 --> 06:17:52,263
Reject the cut.

4371
06:17:52,403 --> 06:17:52,723
Yeah.

4372
06:17:55,164 --> 06:17:56,624
We just reconsidered the motion to reconsider.

4373
06:17:56,744 --> 06:17:58,485
So that would be a motion to reject.

4374
06:17:59,465 --> 06:17:59,866
Yeah, yeah.

4375
06:18:00,706 --> 06:18:05,948
So would it be to reject the cut or to accept the cut?

4376
06:18:06,261 --> 06:18:09,542
Basically, we're back at the point of the cut.

4377
06:18:09,582 --> 06:18:10,983
Well, that's not necessarily true.

4378
06:18:12,103 --> 06:18:15,644
We're basically at the point of where the cut was proposed.

4379
06:18:16,945 --> 06:18:18,745
So right now, we can be a motion to approve.

4380
06:18:19,665 --> 06:18:21,306
We all vote no, and it's not approved.

4381
06:18:21,346 --> 06:18:22,286
There's a motion to reject.

4382
06:18:22,326 --> 06:18:23,647
We all vote yes, and it's not approved.

4383
06:18:23,767 --> 06:18:24,587
So do I have a motion?

4384
06:18:26,468 --> 06:18:26,788
Motion.

4385
06:18:28,008 --> 06:18:28,308
Second.

4386
06:18:28,928 --> 06:18:30,849
Motion to approve the cut.

4387
06:18:31,089 --> 06:18:32,670
So we're voting on the motion to approve the cut.

4388
06:18:32,690 --> 06:18:33,610
Okay.

4389
06:18:35,958 --> 06:18:36,258
We're not.

4390
06:18:36,958 --> 06:18:37,519
I'm just listening.

4391
06:18:37,599 --> 06:18:37,959
We'll vote.

4392
06:18:39,359 --> 06:18:39,819
It'll be clear.

4393
06:18:40,039 --> 06:18:41,340
I think we're all working in the same direction.

4394
06:18:41,380 --> 06:18:42,420
I'm just listening.

4395
06:18:43,180 --> 06:18:43,401
Yep.

4396
06:18:43,441 --> 06:18:44,961
Mr. Clerk, if you could please call the roll.

4397
06:18:45,121 --> 06:18:48,342
Councilor Collins has voted his motion to approve the cut, and then who's the second?

4398
06:18:49,383 --> 06:18:49,903
I'll second.

4399
06:18:50,543 --> 06:18:52,804
That is embarrassing.

4400
06:18:52,824 --> 06:18:53,744
It's to approve the cut.

4401
06:18:53,944 --> 06:18:54,264
Correct.

4402
06:18:55,665 --> 06:18:57,985
President Murrell, could you just clarify which cut we're referring to?

4403
06:18:58,265 --> 06:19:01,287
This is the law, the 81600 at this point.

4404
06:19:01,307 --> 06:19:03,007
To approve the cut?

4405
06:19:03,547 --> 06:19:05,428
Then we'll vote no, and it won't be cut.

4406
06:19:06,170 --> 06:19:08,331
Yeah, we're just trying to.

4407
06:19:12,493 --> 06:19:13,273
Vice President Bears?

4408
06:19:13,613 --> 06:19:14,034
No.

4409
06:19:15,614 --> 06:19:16,175
Councilor Kerrio?

4410
06:19:16,195 --> 06:19:16,295
No.

4411
06:19:17,575 --> 06:19:18,215
Councilor Collins?

4412
06:19:18,416 --> 06:19:18,656
No.

4413
06:19:20,797 --> 06:19:21,277
Councilor Knight?

4414
06:19:22,057 --> 06:19:23,198
For Chief Buckley, no.

4415
06:19:25,239 --> 06:19:26,119
Councilor Scarpelli?

4416
06:19:26,379 --> 06:19:26,659
No.

4417
06:19:27,760 --> 06:19:28,380
Councilor Singh?

4418
06:19:28,520 --> 06:19:28,740
No.

4419
06:19:29,481 --> 06:19:30,081
President Morrell?

4420
06:19:30,341 --> 06:19:30,761
No.

4421
06:19:30,781 --> 06:19:33,482
Zero on the affirmative, seven on the negative, the motion fails.

4422
06:19:34,163 --> 06:19:34,943
The cut is rejected.

4423
06:19:35,455 --> 06:19:54,963
motion to reconsider the cut to executive full-time salary line item 0101025110 of $202,887 on the motion of virtues and bears to reconsider the cut to the executive salary seconded by councilor saying I'll give the clerk a moment to wrap a slip

4424
06:20:13,836 --> 06:20:23,102
Motion by Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Sankto, reconsider the vote on cut to 5010, which is the executive salary.

4425
06:20:24,903 --> 06:20:25,703
Vice President Behrs.

4426
06:20:27,544 --> 06:20:27,945
No.

4427
06:20:29,626 --> 06:20:30,546
Yes, yes, yes.

4428
06:20:33,328 --> 06:20:34,048
Councilor Kerrio.

4429
06:20:35,890 --> 06:20:36,490
We're reconsidering.

4430
06:20:41,834 --> 06:20:43,555
I'm sorry, Councilor Kerrio, I didn't hear you.

4431
06:20:44,095 --> 06:20:44,415
Thank you.

4432
06:20:46,596 --> 06:20:47,276
Councilor Collins?

4433
06:20:47,396 --> 06:20:47,596
Yes.

4434
06:20:47,997 --> 06:20:48,497
Councilor Knight?

4435
06:20:48,597 --> 06:20:48,797
No.

4436
06:20:52,298 --> 06:20:52,998
Councilor Scarpelli?

4437
06:20:53,439 --> 06:20:53,659
Yes.

4438
06:20:54,859 --> 06:20:55,419
Councilor Singh?

4439
06:20:55,699 --> 06:20:55,900
No.

4440
06:20:56,180 --> 06:20:56,720
President Morrell?

4441
06:20:56,860 --> 06:20:57,080
Yes.

4442
06:20:58,481 --> 06:20:59,661
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

4443
06:20:59,701 --> 06:21:00,741
The motion passes.

4444
06:21:02,122 --> 06:21:02,842
Motion on the floor.

4445
06:21:08,624 --> 06:21:09,665
Let's just be consistent.

4446
06:21:09,745 --> 06:21:09,945
Yeah.

4447
06:21:12,553 --> 06:21:14,034
No one's having fun.

4448
06:21:15,115 --> 06:21:15,976
No one's having fun.

4449
06:21:18,438 --> 06:21:23,282
No wait, sorry, it's a motion to accept, just for consistency.

4450
06:21:25,203 --> 06:21:32,029
Okay, so on the motion, Councilor Collins to accept the cut, seconded by Councilor Sang, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

4451
06:21:43,903 --> 06:21:52,367
We still have one more vote after this vote.

4452
06:21:52,387 --> 06:21:54,128
Okay, this is the motion to approve the cut.

4453
06:21:56,269 --> 06:21:58,810
Motion by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang.

4454
06:22:00,031 --> 06:22:00,471
Roll call.

4455
06:22:01,451 --> 06:22:02,272
Vice President Behrs.

4456
06:22:02,732 --> 06:22:03,092
No.

4457
06:22:04,093 --> 06:22:04,793
Councilor Kerrio.

4458
06:22:06,234 --> 06:22:06,834
Councilor Collins.

4459
06:22:06,974 --> 06:22:07,214
No.

4460
06:22:08,395 --> 06:22:08,855
Councilor Knight.

4461
06:22:09,035 --> 06:22:09,315
No.

4462
06:22:10,336 --> 06:22:11,036
Councilor Scarpelli.

4463
06:22:11,216 --> 06:22:11,376
No.

4464
06:22:12,257 --> 06:22:12,737
Councilor Sang.

4465
06:22:14,135 --> 06:22:14,655
President Morrell.

4466
06:22:15,196 --> 06:22:18,058
No, zero in the affirmative, seven in the negative, the motion fails.

4467
06:22:18,959 --> 06:22:19,680
Vice President Paris.

4468
06:22:19,880 --> 06:22:20,821
Thank you, Madam President.

4469
06:22:21,041 --> 06:22:22,842
I'm going to make a motion, one second.

4470
06:22:24,123 --> 06:22:33,952
But to the surprising number of people who are still here and the surprising 46 people who are still on Zoom, the next vote is going to be on the budget.

4471
06:22:34,933 --> 06:22:35,813
I want to be very clear.

4472
06:22:36,872 --> 06:22:52,744
that what just happened doesn't solve our short-term crisis or challenges, doesn't solve our long-term needs, but it was, I believe, a good faith negotiation between the executive branch and the legislative branch of the city of Medford to make some progress on the fiscal 23 budget.

4473
06:22:54,492 --> 06:22:57,755
It doesn't change the position that this budget isn't enough.

4474
06:22:58,636 --> 06:23:02,619
It doesn't change the position that next year's budget from what we've heard isn't enough.

4475
06:23:03,120 --> 06:23:06,863
And we still have a lot of work to do on those issues.

4476
06:23:07,324 --> 06:23:11,748
And we will hopefully be doing it over the next few weeks and months to come.

4477
06:23:13,325 --> 06:23:24,190
I will vote yes on this budget after the enduring or the ordeal we just went through on this negotiation, because I think we won some significant key priorities of this council.

4478
06:23:24,770 --> 06:23:29,892
But I again, wanna be clear that we're still in a deep hole.

4479
06:23:30,213 --> 06:23:39,897
We still have a serious structural deficit and we still need to find a way to raise the revenue to address that this year, next year and the year after until

4480
06:23:40,544 --> 06:23:45,828
the commercial development that's unlocked by the zoning ordinance that we passed can begin to come online.

4481
06:23:46,589 --> 06:23:53,234
With that, I would motion to approve the mayor's fiscal 23 budget as amended.

4482
06:23:53,254 --> 06:23:55,596
Thank you.

4483
06:23:56,056 --> 06:24:02,501
The motion of Ices and Bears to approve the mayor's fiscal year 23 budget as amended, seconded by Councilor Collins.

4484
06:24:08,482 --> 06:24:09,402
We're going to hold the committee.

4485
06:24:09,442 --> 06:24:10,843
We're going to revisit.

4486
06:24:11,483 --> 06:24:13,784
Councilor Knight said he would.

4487
06:24:14,284 --> 06:24:16,285
I never offered the motion to reduce the budget.

4488
06:24:16,525 --> 06:24:19,586
I said that we'll talk about it via ordinance as opposed to finance.

4489
06:24:19,766 --> 06:24:22,427
Basically, everything's as presented with the exception of the items.

4490
06:24:22,467 --> 06:24:22,747
Thank you.

4491
06:24:22,767 --> 06:24:24,367
I appreciate it.

4492
06:24:24,807 --> 06:24:25,528
Councilor Knight.

4493
06:24:25,788 --> 06:24:31,030
Madam President, at the beginning of these discussions, I explained the reasons why I was going to vote no on this budget.

4494
06:24:33,255 --> 06:24:36,478
I'm gonna have to find something else to talk about now that we've got 2 lawyers instead of one.

4495
06:24:37,359 --> 06:24:39,200
All I wanted was a part-time lawyer, and we got two.

4496
06:24:39,560 --> 06:24:43,424
So I'm very happy with the compromise that we were able to reach with the administration.

4497
06:24:43,784 --> 06:24:48,628
I will be voting in favor of the budget this evening based upon the fact that we were able to restore $300,000 to the schools.

4498
06:24:48,828 --> 06:24:51,451
That's for young children.

4499
06:24:52,392 --> 06:24:53,613
That's for young public school children.

4500
06:24:53,693 --> 06:24:54,874
I think this is gonna make a big difference.

4501
06:24:55,714 --> 06:25:01,019
I've also been talking about ad nauseam, the need for this council to have the tools and the toolbox necessary to do the job.

4502
06:25:01,742 --> 06:25:15,012
And with the appropriation of $50,000 for us to continue looking at phase two for the zoning consultant, and also $85,000 for our assistant city solicitor that will work part-time at the city council, I think a lot of our concerns are going to be addressed through those two mechanisms.

4503
06:25:15,633 --> 06:25:18,355
So with that being said, it was a pleasure to work with the mayor.

4504
06:25:18,395 --> 06:25:22,177
I was glad to see her here this evening so that we could actually work something out and negotiate it.

4505
06:25:22,598 --> 06:25:27,041
And again, like I said, thank you to you, Madam President, for the work that you did in putting this together.

4506
06:25:28,442 --> 06:25:36,185
and also thank you to the mayor for coming down here to the belly of the beast and facing the music and being able to work with us to negotiate something that can satisfy us.

4507
06:25:36,405 --> 06:25:37,145
Thank you, Councilor Nye.

4508
06:25:37,185 --> 06:25:37,845
Councilor Collins.

4509
06:25:38,826 --> 06:25:39,546
Thank you, President Morrell.

4510
06:25:39,566 --> 06:25:40,886
I'll keep this as short as possible.

4511
06:25:40,926 --> 06:25:42,647
In the remarks I made earlier, I mentioned

4512
06:25:43,887 --> 06:26:01,937
solicitor for the council zoning consultant schools libraries from the bottom of my heart, I want to thank the mayor and her team for coming back to the table for making sure that we cross back over those bright lines that I had and many of my fellow counselors had this this has been a wild evening, it's been a wild but season.

4513
06:26:05,227 --> 06:26:10,470
when describing the mayor, you know, during last year's campaign through this term, I've said she's a good faith actor.

4514
06:26:10,490 --> 06:26:14,532
I really, I want to thank her for providing evidence of that tonight.

4515
06:26:15,192 --> 06:26:19,834
I hope that we can have this kind of direct line of communication and exchange more often.

4516
06:26:20,715 --> 06:26:22,796
But for now, I just want to say thank you to the chief of staff.

4517
06:26:22,896 --> 06:26:23,476
Thank you to mayor.

4518
06:26:24,517 --> 06:26:24,997
Let's pass this.

4519
06:26:26,318 --> 06:26:27,078
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

4520
06:26:27,458 --> 06:26:27,798
Thank you.

4521
06:26:28,199 --> 06:26:40,702
I think it's important to reiterate this, you know, this by no means solves our revenue crisis, by no means solves our needs deficit, but it's not just a win for the council, this is a win for affordable housing, it's a win for libraries, for schools.

4522
06:26:41,922 --> 06:26:44,023
I'm glad we were able to get some work done tonight.

4523
06:26:45,143 --> 06:26:45,923
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

4524
06:26:45,963 --> 06:26:47,284
Any further discussion from the council?

4525
06:26:48,438 --> 06:26:50,660
Just briefly, I already noted before just my thanks to the mayor.

4526
06:26:50,720 --> 06:26:58,828
I wanna thank the council for their willingness to take part in what has been a very wild ride of a budget season as we navigated this strange place.

4527
06:26:58,908 --> 06:27:01,610
I think it is a testament to how far this body has come.

4528
06:27:02,051 --> 06:27:09,458
Two years ago, council budget talks came to a halt for a less than perfect situation.

4529
06:27:09,698 --> 06:27:13,762
And we had a less, less, less, less than perfect situation this year, and everyone still came to the table

4530
06:27:14,307 --> 06:27:18,871
for every meeting that they could, COVID and family and everything else barred.

4531
06:27:18,911 --> 06:27:24,015
So I just want to thank my fellow counselors for navigating this process with me in good faith.

4532
06:27:24,215 --> 06:27:29,019
So on the motion of, no, no.

4533
06:27:33,803 --> 06:27:38,407
On the motion of Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Collins.

4534
06:27:38,968 --> 06:27:40,109

Records of the meeting of June 21st, 2022 were passed to Councilor Collins.
