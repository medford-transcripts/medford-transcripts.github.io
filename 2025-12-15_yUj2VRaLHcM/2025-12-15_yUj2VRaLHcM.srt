00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:57,589
Next piece is a selection from

2
00:02:24,355 --> 00:02:24,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Nutcrackers.

3
00:05:55,318 --> 00:05:56,179
Thank you all.

4
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:13,199
Stay with me.

5
00:08:56,877 --> 00:08:59,723
We're going to continue our tour.

6
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,607
Music.

7
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:30,484
[SPEAKER_11]: It is very rewarding to work with our young people.

8
00:11:30,504 --> 00:11:31,825
[SPEAKER_11]: They are wonderful.

9
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:33,426
[SPEAKER_11]: They have a lot of potential.

10
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:36,108
[SPEAKER_11]: They bring so much joy to my life.

11
00:11:37,049 --> 00:11:43,854
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to invite some of our senior and one junior students to share their experience in the music program.

12
00:11:44,895 --> 00:11:45,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Sam Keith.

13
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,824
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, my name is Sam.

14
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:58,872
[SPEAKER_21]: I started violin when I was really young, a little bit before I actually ended up going to Medford Public Schools, which was kindergarten.

15
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:08,363
[SPEAKER_21]: I consistently worked with a private teacher over my entire elementary school career.

16
00:12:09,043 --> 00:12:12,466
[SPEAKER_21]: I got invited in fifth grade to join Miss Chang with the string ensemble.

17
00:12:12,706 --> 00:12:21,993
[SPEAKER_21]: And most of my violin work before then had mostly been like, you know, just solo rap, go up with a pianist, play a piece, very cool, everybody claps, have fun.

18
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:29,998
[SPEAKER_21]: When I joined the string ensemble with Miss Chang, I really learned what it meant to play as a group as well and how fun that could be.

19
00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:43,384
[SPEAKER_21]: And so, like, you know, for the past eight years, I guess, no, I don't even know, I've been with Miss Chang working with, between the middle school orchestras and the high school orchestras.

20
00:12:44,805 --> 00:13:00,816
[SPEAKER_21]: And I've also carried the stuff that I've learned about working with people in groups beyond just those groups, with the Tufts Youth Philharmonic and Boston Youth Symphony, and nowadays violins, a massive part of my life, and no doubt, a lot of that's thanks to Miss Chang.

21
00:13:01,037 --> 00:13:01,217
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

22
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:12,736
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, my name is Jayden Ville.

23
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:17,059
[SPEAKER_24]: I started playing the violin in fourth grade, but when I met Ms.

24
00:13:17,099 --> 00:13:23,643
[SPEAKER_24]: Chang in sixth grade and joined the string ensemble, I think that's when I really started, became in love with the violin.

25
00:13:24,744 --> 00:13:26,826
[SPEAKER_24]: There are two main things I took from the string program.

26
00:13:27,526 --> 00:13:29,988
[SPEAKER_24]: One is, of course, the friends we made along the way.

27
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:33,823
[SPEAKER_24]: A lot of the people you see around me here are some of my closest friends.

28
00:13:34,343 --> 00:13:48,288
[SPEAKER_24]: You know each other since sixth grade, and since then in our journey through MICA, through the pandemic and learning violin during COVID, or even during the competition that we went through, or this green corn test we formed, or the chamber music that we've played together.

29
00:13:48,768 --> 00:13:50,749
[SPEAKER_24]: It's really been an eye-opening experience.

30
00:13:51,516 --> 00:13:55,078
[SPEAKER_24]: And the second thing I took from it is what it really means to be good at something.

31
00:13:55,598 --> 00:13:56,039
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, Ms.

32
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:59,561
[SPEAKER_24]: Chang loves to push us hard and help us reach a higher level of playing.

33
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:03,463
[SPEAKER_24]: But it's not just focusing on the notes, it's thinking about, it's more than that.

34
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:07,005
[SPEAKER_24]: It's thinking, how can we really transmit our emotions through music?

35
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:11,348
[SPEAKER_24]: How can we go further than just the notes but go deeper into the expression?

36
00:14:12,842 --> 00:14:17,845
[SPEAKER_24]: And being good at something isn't just trying to play as great as Hilary Hahn at the first start.

37
00:14:18,445 --> 00:14:20,866
[SPEAKER_24]: To be good at that level, you have to start at the basics first.

38
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:28,171
[SPEAKER_24]: Just playing the simple A string, just playing open strings, then leveling up, adding the notes, then the rhythms, then adding it together as the orchestra.

39
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:31,672
[SPEAKER_24]: All that together is what really makes music special.

40
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:34,754
[SPEAKER_24]: And those two lessons, I think I'll take with me for the rest of my life.

41
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:35,735
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Ms.

42
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:35,895
[SPEAKER_24]: Chen.

43
00:14:42,262 --> 00:14:42,602
[SPEAKER_25]: All righty.

44
00:14:43,102 --> 00:14:43,923
[SPEAKER_25]: Good morning, everyone.

45
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:44,923
[SPEAKER_25]: My name is Jaden Wu.

46
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:48,224
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm a junior at Medford High School.

47
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:51,726
[SPEAKER_25]: And originally, I started playing the viola in fourth grade.

48
00:14:52,246 --> 00:14:54,547
[SPEAKER_25]: And then I switched over to cello in fifth grade.

49
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:57,028
[SPEAKER_25]: And honestly, ever since then, I've stuck with that.

50
00:14:57,928 --> 00:14:59,189
[SPEAKER_25]: It's been a really fun journey.

51
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:06,111
[SPEAKER_25]: I'd honestly say, I don't want to sound corny, but orchestra has definitely done some things in a good way to benefit my life.

52
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:10,093
[SPEAKER_25]: I've made some awesome friends that I'll probably forever be friends with.

53
00:15:10,973 --> 00:15:19,855
[SPEAKER_25]: And it's just been an awesome time being able to play with such talented people and going through music festivals.

54
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:22,395
[SPEAKER_25]: And yeah, honestly, it's just been amazing.

55
00:15:22,616 --> 00:15:22,956
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

56
00:15:29,777 --> 00:15:33,998
[SPEAKER_11]: And the last piece they'd like to play for you is Forever Joyful.

57
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:21,422
Yeah.

58
00:16:46,823 --> 00:16:47,023
Yeah.

59
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,102
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you and thank you to my dear students.

60
00:18:47,982 --> 00:18:51,284
[SPEAKER_11]: We wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.

61
00:18:51,525 --> 00:18:51,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

62
00:18:59,468 --> 00:19:01,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to the Medford High School Orchestra.

63
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:08,980
[SPEAKER_09]: If you all could hang on for just a quick minute so we can take a photo with you, but I just need to officially open the meeting before we do that.

64
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,705
[SPEAKER_09]: So give me like two minutes and then we'll ask you all to come up for a photo op.

65
00:19:12,845 --> 00:19:13,226
[SPEAKER_09]: How's that sound?

66
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:14,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Good?

67
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Is everyone okay to hang in for a couple minutes?

68
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:17,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, great.

00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:19,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome everybody.

70
00:19:19,253 --> 00:19:25,597

[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

111
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:18,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, motion passes.

112
00:21:19,058 --> 00:21:24,502
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to move on to the report of the superintendent, which begins with our Mustang moment.

113
00:21:25,263 --> 00:21:29,165
[SPEAKER_09]: You've already been enjoying the Mustang moment with all of the beautiful music from our orchestra.

114
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:33,849
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would like to welcome you all to come join us so that we can take a photo with all of you.

115
00:21:34,449 --> 00:21:35,490
[SPEAKER_09]: And what's that?

116
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,681
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, we can do that.

117
00:21:38,821 --> 00:21:39,321
[SPEAKER_09]: That would be fine.

118
00:21:40,983 --> 00:21:45,607
[SPEAKER_09]: So we will be like on a little field trip here for a few minutes to take a picture with all the fun instruments.

119
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:47,208
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wanted to say thank you.

120
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,312
[SPEAKER_09]: When you join us, our meetings are so much more fun.

121
00:21:51,372 --> 00:21:55,375
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe like twice a month on Mondays, you could think about coming.

122
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:56,356
[SPEAKER_09]: That'd be great.

123
00:21:57,197 --> 00:22:02,541
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're gonna take a picture and then we will be on to recognizing our fall athletes.

124
00:22:02,561 --> 00:22:03,322
[SPEAKER_09]: So stay with us.

125
00:24:10,267 --> 00:24:12,933
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you everyone.

126
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:21,229
[SPEAKER_09]: We are on to our second Mustang moment of the night, which is recognition of our fall athletic achievements, and I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Galussi.

127
00:24:24,885 --> 00:24:25,846
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

128
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:41,015
[SPEAKER_16]: I do want to just say, just to echo the words of Vice Chairmember Graham at how wonderful it is to start our meeting off with students as part of the Mustang moment and setting the tone for the meeting with our orchestra.

129
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:42,396
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just like being at the Pops.

130
00:24:42,476 --> 00:24:45,278
[SPEAKER_16]: It's a nice, warm, inviting way to start the meeting.

131
00:24:45,498 --> 00:24:47,840
[SPEAKER_16]: And just wanted to make sure that we appreciate it.

132
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,141
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said thank you to the high school orchestra.

133
00:24:51,202 --> 00:25:05,827
[SPEAKER_16]: So now we're moving on to our fall sports and athletic director Robert O'Leary unfortunately was double booked this evening and is not able to join us in person but he is here to kick us off.

134
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:15,770
[SPEAKER_16]: We are here to recognize GBL champs as well as all-stars within the GBL and he is going to kick us off virtually to get the the show on the road.

135
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,531
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm going to just pause for a moment as

136
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Pippicelli starts us off.

137

141
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:49,583

142

00:26:31,681 --> 00:26:35,868
[SPEAKER_05]: The girls soccer team had another banner year, qualified for the postseason.

149
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Their overall record, including the postseason, was 13 wins, five losses, and a tie.

150
00:26:42,774 --> 00:26:44,535
[SPEAKER_05]: The girls were undefeated in the GBL.

151
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:49,239
[SPEAKER_05]: They scored 55 goals, allowed 19 in all competitions.

152
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:54,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Ninth grader Parker Prisner scored 13 of those and had an assist.

153
00:26:55,303 --> 00:27:00,868
[SPEAKER_05]: And 10th grader Sienna Fossey was tied with that in points with eight goals and six assists.

154
00:27:01,588 --> 00:27:18,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of these girls that you see behind me, as well as the ones that weren't able to make it because they were at other sports, or had other commitments, were able to contribute offensively with assistant goals, but also made defensive contributions to the team's 10 shutouts during the season.

155
00:27:19,924 --> 00:27:23,887
[SPEAKER_05]: Our GBL All-Stars this year were Caitlin Ows, who is at a,

156
00:27:25,765 --> 00:27:34,413
[SPEAKER_05]: hockey game tonight, Sienna Fossey, who is at a basketball game tonight, and CeCe Colombo, who is right to my right.

157
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,598
[SPEAKER_05]: We also had two Eastern Mass All-Stars named.

158
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:51,966
[SPEAKER_05]: That goes into a general pool of other coaches, and then they vote.

159
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:56,753
[SPEAKER_05]: CeCe Colombo received that honor, and Sienna Fossey received that honor.

160
00:28:05,675 --> 00:28:05,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

161
00:28:06,175 --> 00:28:20,187
[SPEAKER_16]: So just as a measure of procedure, I think we're going to have everyone speak this evening, and then we'll take a little brief pause to do pictures with the champs and the all-stars, just so people at home know we can keep going for right now.

162
00:28:20,327 --> 00:28:20,848
[SPEAKER_16]: If that's okay?

163
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:21,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

164
00:28:21,228 --> 00:28:25,952
[SPEAKER_16]: All right, you kicking it to the next team or... Yes, I can.

165
00:28:25,972 --> 00:28:27,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

166
00:28:28,254 --> 00:28:33,399
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to introduce the GBL champs golf team under Rich Citrano.

167
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:46,512
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

168
00:28:46,692 --> 00:28:49,234
[SPEAKER_20]: I would also like to thank you guys for inviting us.

169
00:28:49,774 --> 00:28:51,014
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a privilege to be here.

170
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:53,556
[SPEAKER_20]: It was an exciting year.

171
00:28:54,216 --> 00:28:59,178
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of the teams were gunning for us because we were the GBL defending champions.

172
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,141
[SPEAKER_20]: And we did happen to repeat, which is quite a feat.

173
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:10,044
[SPEAKER_20]: We did have 10 wins and zero losses in league play.

174
00:29:11,379 --> 00:29:24,585
[SPEAKER_20]: We also had Emmett Chasteen voted by the coaches as the two-time league MVP along with Jonathan Wright who was also a GBL All-Star.

175
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:31,247
[SPEAKER_20]: All of the players behind me had won more matches than they had lost during the season.

176
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:37,310
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not sure if you're familiar with how it works with golf but there are eight matches that go on at a meet.

177
00:29:38,992 --> 00:29:43,414
[SPEAKER_20]: And unfortunately, we can't have everybody play in, but we do rotate.

178
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:48,016
[SPEAKER_20]: And like I mentioned earlier, everybody had a winning racket, which was pretty impressive.

179
00:29:50,157 --> 00:29:52,758
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's the season.

180
00:29:54,239 --> 00:29:54,699
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to.

181
00:30:01,264 --> 00:30:03,586
[SPEAKER_20]: Excuse me, I did forget to mention two more things.

182
00:30:04,647 --> 00:30:12,912
[SPEAKER_20]: At the end of the year, we select three players to participate in the GBL shootout, and Medford did win the GBL shootout this year.

183
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:23,880
[SPEAKER_20]: And we also qualified for the Division II Northern States, which we sent six players, and we did better than we did the previous year.

184
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,321
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's what we're trying to do.

185
00:30:25,361 --> 00:30:28,163
[SPEAKER_20]: We're trying to improve each year, and so far we have.

186
00:30:35,028 --> 00:30:38,772
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like to introduce now the boys' soccer coach, John Preston Giovanni.

187
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:51,946
[SPEAKER_23]: Good evening, everybody.

188
00:30:52,898 --> 00:31:04,587
[SPEAKER_23]: On behalf of the boys soccer family at Medford High School, we want to congratulate all of the fall all-star athletes, all the seniors, all the coaches.

189
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,409
[SPEAKER_23]: Congratulations on a great season.

190
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:20,900
[SPEAKER_23]: From our soccer family, from our coaches, from our players, from our families, we want to thank everyone within the walls of Medford High School for your support this season, and in our Medford community.

191
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,882
[SPEAKER_23]: We've reached a lot of support throughout the season, and we can't thank you guys enough, so thank you.

192
00:31:25,963 --> 00:31:29,244
[SPEAKER_23]: We also want to congratulate my man here, Fortson.

193
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:30,004
[SPEAKER_23]: He's our senior.

194
00:31:30,545 --> 00:31:36,027
[SPEAKER_23]: He was selected as our GBL All-Star this season, and also our Eastern Mass All-Star.

195
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:37,888
[SPEAKER_23]: So Fortson, congratulations.

196
00:31:45,711 --> 00:31:47,692
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you very much for allowing us to be here tonight.

197
00:31:48,352 --> 00:31:49,733
[SPEAKER_23]: Next, we'd like to bring on our crew team.

198
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:51,233
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

199
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:09,434
[SPEAKER_04]: So before I make the brief remarks, one thing that I'm especially proud of is the intersection of arts and athletics.

200
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:14,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Four members of the ensemble are also on the rowing team that you heard from, and that's pretty terrific.

201
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:20,807
[SPEAKER_04]: And I should thank Miss Chang for allowing that, because you can imagine rowing can really do some damage to your hands, right?

202
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:24,336
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so we had a terrific fall season.

203
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:28,298
[SPEAKER_04]: 44 student-athletes competed in five regattas.

204
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:36,143
[SPEAKER_04]: We took home, or they took home, sorry, 12 medals including a gold and two silvers from the state championships.

205
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:45,247
[SPEAKER_04]: The gold was for the men's quad and the silvers were for the women's double and men's double.

206
00:32:47,777 --> 00:32:52,020
[SPEAKER_04]: We also got a bronze at state championships in the men's double, right?

207
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:59,005
[SPEAKER_04]: You too, good, excellent.

208
00:32:59,205 --> 00:33:02,868
[SPEAKER_04]: Also this fall, we received a record three invitations to the Head of the Charles.

209
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:05,490
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you who know, Head of the Charles is a pretty amazing event.

210
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,531
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta get squeezed in here.

211
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:13,876
[SPEAKER_04]: As a high school student to be able to participate, and some of our student athletes will get to participate and compete in Head of the Charles.

212
00:33:14,621 --> 00:33:19,443
[SPEAKER_04]: almost three, if not all, four years, which is pretty amazing and an amazing honor.

213
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:22,025
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get to row in the head of the Charlesville High School student.

214
00:33:22,045 --> 00:33:24,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I had to wait until college, so it's pretty amazing.

215
00:33:25,206 --> 00:33:34,510
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking forward to a spring that will include the reintroduction of the Mayor's Cup, so we'll expect a mayor to be there for that and also other school committee members.

216
00:33:35,011 --> 00:33:37,952
[SPEAKER_04]: We won't put you in a boat unless you want to be put in a boat.

217
00:33:38,812 --> 00:33:39,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it.

218
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:39,853
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

219
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:45,094
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as GBL All-Stars, the team wants to recognize Gianna Purr for it.

220
00:33:45,735 --> 00:33:46,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Right here, Gianna.

221
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:52,344
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how much you know about rowing.

222
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:53,626
[SPEAKER_04]: There are two types of rowing.

223
00:33:53,646 --> 00:33:57,250
[SPEAKER_04]: There's sweep rowing, where you have one oar, and there's sculling, where you have two oars.

224
00:33:58,171 --> 00:34:04,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Gianna switched from one side, sweep rowing, to the other this season and stroked the women's four, which is not an easy task.

225
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:11,427
[SPEAKER_04]: She took over from an injured rower, so thank you very much, and she did so with great enthusiasm and fortuitousness, right?

226
00:34:12,067 --> 00:34:12,988
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Gianna.

227
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:19,935
[SPEAKER_04]: The other two GBL All-Stars, sort of similar to other student-athletes, are in other commitments tonight.

228
00:34:21,256 --> 00:34:26,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt Stricker and James Klugisch are on the swim team, and they're at an important pre-meet dinner tonight.

229
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,723
[SPEAKER_04]: So that happens, right?

230
00:34:29,924 --> 00:34:30,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you very much.

231
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:34,529
[SPEAKER_04]: We're looking forward to a spring of great sprint racing.

232
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:35,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys have anything you want to say?

233
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:40,504
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're really excited to be building our novice program.

234
00:34:40,524 --> 00:34:45,226
[SPEAKER_04]: We have two members of the novice team here, and two members of the novice team are among the ensemble.

235
00:34:45,347 --> 00:34:46,347
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're pretty excited.

236
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:47,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

237
00:34:47,508 --> 00:34:47,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

238
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:57,575
[SPEAKER_16]: At this time, I'd like to bring up Medford Cheer.

239
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:58,917
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.

240
00:34:59,658 --> 00:35:02,220
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for my voice, first grade teacher problems.

241
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:05,744
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Kristin Galeona.

242
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:09,848
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my first season up at Medford Eye as a cheer coach.

243
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:12,270
[SPEAKER_00]: And my assistant is not here tonight.

244
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicole Guarino, she's at practice.

245
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:20,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Our goals this year or this season have been really three.

246
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:32,080
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to bring back some polish, pride to our sidelines, safety, and our future goal will be to build a competitive program.

247
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:40,763
[SPEAKER_00]: This couldn't have happened without everybody sort of putting their trust in us and the help of

248
00:35:42,362 --> 00:35:59,569
[SPEAKER_00]: outgoing athletic director Bob Maloney, Rachel Perry, Rob O'Leary, Principal Cabral, Dr. Galussi, and Mayor Lungo-Koehn, who all invested in us and our new uniforms.

249
00:36:00,009 --> 00:36:01,790
[SPEAKER_00]: For cheerleading, that's your equipment.

250
00:36:02,931 --> 00:36:05,552
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a uniform and maybe some mats, if you're lucky.

251
00:36:06,312 --> 00:36:08,372
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's really helped us.

252
00:36:09,153 --> 00:36:18,835
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, the discipline, consistency, and commitment of our team and of our seniors like Marcella next to me.

253
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:19,955
[SPEAKER_00]: She's our all-star.

254
00:36:20,835 --> 00:36:25,496
[SPEAKER_00]: She got hurt at home, not with us, but right at the beginning of the season.

255
00:36:25,876 --> 00:36:34,778
[SPEAKER_00]: And that didn't stop her from coming to every practice, every game, and showing the team through her leadership what it means to have commitment.

256
00:36:35,558 --> 00:36:39,321
[SPEAKER_00]: Her nickname is Mama because she takes care of everybody on the team.

257
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:48,688
[SPEAKER_00]: We tried to get her to cheer for winter, but she's busy with her future professional goals and working at Winchester Hospital.

258
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,291
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's our GBL All-Star, Marcella Lucas.

259
00:36:57,555 --> 00:36:59,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Up next is cross country.

260
00:37:10,406 --> 00:37:12,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, thank you for having us here tonight.

261
00:37:12,948 --> 00:37:18,954
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Eileen O'Hara, and I coach the girls and boys cross-country teams, and I'm joined by two of our all-star athletes this evening.

262
00:37:20,295 --> 00:37:35,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Both cross-country teams, the boys and girls, had great seasons this fall, and both teams actually had the same record, with six wins and one loss in the regular season, and both teams also took second place at our end-of-season GBL championship race.

263
00:37:37,918 --> 00:37:50,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Our seniors and captains were excellent role models who showed our younger athletes what it takes to find success in cross-country, and as a result, we saw athletes across both teams see significant improvements in their times throughout the season.

264
00:37:52,263 --> 00:38:01,706
[SPEAKER_03]: We had three athletes qualify for the Massachusetts All-State Meet, and we had five GBL All-Stars, two of which are here tonight, and I'll now recognize them.

265
00:38:02,586 --> 00:38:06,968
[SPEAKER_03]: On the girls team, our GBL All-Stars were Olivia O'Brien,

266
00:38:07,812 --> 00:38:12,294
[SPEAKER_03]: who couldn't be here tonight, Isabelle D'Souza Vieira, who is here.

267
00:38:19,718 --> 00:38:22,279
[SPEAKER_03]: And Emma Beardsley, who was also not able to attend.

268
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,762
[SPEAKER_03]: On the boys team, our GBL All-Stars are Aaron Greenberg, who is here tonight.

269
00:38:33,261 --> 00:38:37,742
[SPEAKER_03]: And Adam Lewis, who was also the league champion and the league MVP.

270
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:43,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Next I'd like to introduce Coach Curley to present for the football team.

271
00:38:57,406 --> 00:38:57,686
Thank you.

272
00:38:57,886 --> 00:38:58,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

273
00:38:58,406 --> 00:38:59,486
[SPEAKER_01]: How we doing?

274
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:02,587
[SPEAKER_01]: I first want to thank everyone in this room right now to give

275
00:39:03,182 --> 00:39:15,173
[SPEAKER_01]: these student athletes an opportunity to show their skill and their craft and it really does mean a lot to me that everyone in this room can get recognized because they have to be a student first and then play a sport after.

276
00:39:15,193 --> 00:39:18,555
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard to do any day in society.

277
00:39:19,236 --> 00:39:21,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations to everyone in this room for winning these awards.

278
00:39:21,296 --> 00:39:23,697
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations to the GBL champions.

279
00:39:23,757 --> 00:39:28,278
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome to see Medford keep on going on a high note and trying to get to the high bar.

280
00:39:28,438 --> 00:39:34,400
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome that we have coaches pushing these athletes to go further and further, to go further and further for Medford.

281
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:40,661
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank Mr. O'Leary, Mrs. Perry, to give me the chance and opportunity to coach this team.

282
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:42,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a coach for the last seven years.

283
00:39:43,242 --> 00:39:44,362
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a great opportunity.

284
00:39:46,143 --> 00:39:48,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Season really wasn't the greatest for the start.

285
00:39:49,186 --> 00:40:01,477
[SPEAKER_01]: We were 0-4 and then we went on a five game winning streak and it really shows if you keep on trying and buying into what you see as going forward, you'll actually

286
00:40:02,823 --> 00:40:06,666
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm trying to say is, if you keep on trying, good things will happen.

287
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:13,452
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like the kid to my left and the kid to my right is a really good thing, is a really big thing of what happened this year.

288
00:40:13,852 --> 00:40:16,374
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to know Key Martins when he was in fifth grade.

289
00:40:16,394 --> 00:40:19,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to know Demi Georges when he was in ninth grade.

290
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:26,403
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt like I knew them since they were like probably about five years old because they were really bought into what I was doing and what the program needed to do.

291
00:40:27,043 --> 00:40:32,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm very happy that they both got to be GBL All-Stars this year because they tried all four years.

292
00:40:32,645 --> 00:40:35,707
[SPEAKER_01]: The first year was rocky, but they're ending on a high note.

293
00:40:36,207 --> 00:40:42,389
[SPEAKER_01]: They won 17 games in a three-year span, and that's the first time, I think, since in the 80s in this city.

294
00:40:42,449 --> 00:40:49,752
[SPEAKER_01]: So very good job by these two captains being leaders, but also showing up and buying into me and buying into the city.

295
00:40:50,193 --> 00:40:50,953
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you very much.

296
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:01,472
[SPEAKER_16]: and like to welcome Volleyball to round us out.

297
00:41:04,074 --> 00:41:04,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, everybody.

298
00:41:05,074 --> 00:41:05,975
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for having us.

299
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:15,781
[SPEAKER_12]: I just want to first off thank Robert O'Leary and Rachel Perry, the AD and assistant AD, for all their support this season and also all the parents.

300
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:22,124
[SPEAKER_12]: The Medford High girls volleyball team wrapped up a competitive and exciting fall season with a 6-12 record.

301
00:41:22,685 --> 00:41:28,008
[SPEAKER_12]: The Mustangs played exceptional teamwork, skill, and determination, proving every single game they played.

302
00:41:28,468 --> 00:41:34,810
[SPEAKER_12]: They fought all the way until the end, no matter the outcome of each match, and their commitment, hard work, and passion were evident both on and off the court.

303
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:42,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Although the Mustangs fell short of qualifying for the state tournament, they concluded their season on a high note with an outstanding senior night victory on their home court.

304
00:41:43,173 --> 00:41:48,495
[SPEAKER_12]: We graduated 10 seniors, and we thank them for their commitment to the Medford Volleyball Program over the last four years.

305
00:41:49,316 --> 00:41:52,817
[SPEAKER_12]: My all-star is not here, but I'd like to recognize Emma Moellerba.

306
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:57,262
[SPEAKER_12]: She's a junior setter and she's playing basketball tonight, so that's why she's not here.

307
00:41:57,762 --> 00:42:02,307
[SPEAKER_12]: She always leads by example, showing up prepared, focused, and ready to give her best effort every day.

308
00:42:02,608 --> 00:42:08,495
[SPEAKER_12]: Emma had an outstanding season and has consistently demonstrated outstanding dedication and commitment to the Medford Volleyball Program.

309
00:42:09,295 --> 00:42:09,576
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

310
00:42:18,392 --> 00:42:19,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much.

311
00:42:19,712 --> 00:42:26,175
[SPEAKER_16]: This is just a wonderful way to demonstrate all of the great things that are happening in Medford athletics.

312
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:27,435
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you all for coming.

313
00:42:28,455 --> 00:42:31,156
[SPEAKER_16]: We are gonna take a few pictures.

314
00:42:31,176 --> 00:42:34,817
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm trying to think of the best way to do it because there's so many of you.

315
00:42:34,858 --> 00:42:37,258
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe we just start with like the teams that are here.

316
00:42:37,338 --> 00:42:44,961
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can go from girls soccer to golf, and then we'll make sure we get in the other teams and the all-stars.

317
00:42:46,539 --> 00:42:48,298
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, so girls soccer, come on up please.

318
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:31,024
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks everybody.

319
00:49:44,953 --> 00:49:45,693
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, good evening.

320
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:46,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Can you hear me?

321
00:49:48,468 --> 00:49:53,052
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to just turn it over to Dr. Galussi, who wants to make a comment about metapathletics.

322
00:49:53,732 --> 00:49:54,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

323
00:49:54,313 --> 00:50:05,001
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to make sure for the people that are here and listening that we also have two sports teams that are year long, and we will be acknowledging them in the spring.

324
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:06,923
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have the eSports team.

325
00:50:07,423 --> 00:50:09,324
[SPEAKER_16]: that I know competed over the weekend.

326
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:11,124
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm still waiting to hear how they did.

327
00:50:11,745 --> 00:50:14,165
[SPEAKER_16]: And we also have our unified sports team.

328
00:50:14,205 --> 00:50:18,727
[SPEAKER_16]: They had their basketball season, and then they're moving on to their spring season.

329
00:50:18,767 --> 00:50:24,249
[SPEAKER_16]: So both of those teams will be acknowledged when we acknowledge the teams in the spring.

330
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:27,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Just want to make sure I made note of that and all their hard work.

331
00:50:28,411 --> 00:50:30,092
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you very much, Dr. Glusi.

332
00:50:30,992 --> 00:50:32,232
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we still taken out of order?

333
00:50:32,252 --> 00:50:33,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Number two, special recognition?

334
00:50:34,873 --> 00:50:35,033
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

335
00:50:35,113 --> 00:50:37,274
[SPEAKER_17]: Special recognition of school committee members.

336
00:50:37,414 --> 00:50:39,975
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll turn it over back to you, superintendent.

337
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:45,197
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to honor member Nicole Brandly and member John Tapa.

338
00:50:45,857 --> 00:50:46,557
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, thank you.

339
00:50:46,617 --> 00:50:52,800
[SPEAKER_16]: So, just a few words on behalf of the Medford School Committee.

340
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:56,501
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to spend a few minutes talking about member Brandly.

341
00:50:57,165 --> 00:51:02,086
[SPEAKER_16]: I know over the monitor and member in Tapa.

342
00:51:02,126 --> 00:51:10,949
[SPEAKER_16]: So first and foremost, I want to extend my gratitude for member Branley for your dedicated service to the school committee.

343
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:20,292
[SPEAKER_16]: Your commitment to our students and families was seen and we're deeply appreciative of the time and the care and the passion that you brought to the work.

344
00:51:21,192 --> 00:51:35,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Your advocacy for safety, supportive learning environments has been unwavering, and you are constantly centering the students' well-being in your discussions and ensuring that safety remains a foundational priority for the schools.

345
00:51:36,703 --> 00:51:49,312
[SPEAKER_16]: Before joining the committee, Member Branley worked in our kindergarten classrooms and where I got to know her well, helping teachers create safe and warm and welcoming environments and

346
00:51:50,184 --> 00:52:00,333
[SPEAKER_16]: you brought that passion with you to the school committee, as well as your passion for career and technical education, which has been a tremendous asset to the committee.

347
00:52:00,793 --> 00:52:15,907
[SPEAKER_16]: You've been a strong champion for CTE learning and opportunities and what it creates for our students, opening doors to both college and career pathways and ensuring that every learner can see a future that they can achieve.

348
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:27,483
[SPEAKER_16]: So I wanna thank you for your dedication, your commitment, and the heart that you brought to your work on the committee, and you've left a meaningful impact.

349
00:52:28,644 --> 00:52:37,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Intoppa, I got to know you through this role, which has been a privilege, and also want to thank you for your tireless effort and commitment.

350
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:45,995
[SPEAKER_16]: As someone who was a proud product of Medford Public Schools, you brought both a personal history and a deep commitment.

351
00:52:47,150 --> 00:52:58,125
[SPEAKER_16]: to the work, it was very clear that that was your driving goal and that you wanted to leave the district stronger and more responsive and more equitable than you found it.

352
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:02,451
[SPEAKER_16]: You were a constant presence at a lot of school events.

353
00:53:03,688 --> 00:53:08,390
[SPEAKER_16]: You were at performances, games, celebrations, and community events.

354
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:10,210
[SPEAKER_16]: And that didn't go unnoticed.

355
00:53:10,991 --> 00:53:18,674
[SPEAKER_16]: Your visibility was symbolic, and it reflected how much you really care about the students and the school district and the community.

356
00:53:19,714 --> 00:53:28,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Throughout the time on the committee, you encouraged us to strengthen our communication and our equity around decision making.

357
00:53:28,316 --> 00:53:33,917
[SPEAKER_16]: So your advocacy helped us around important conversations throughout the district.

358
00:53:34,537 --> 00:53:35,957
[SPEAKER_16]: And I thank you very much.

359
00:53:36,277 --> 00:53:37,938
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been a pleasure getting to know you.

360
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:41,739
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're very grateful to your service on the Medford School Committee.

361
00:53:42,299 --> 00:53:44,499
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if other people want to say a few words.

362
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:47,760
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have something small to offer you.

363
00:53:48,878 --> 00:53:49,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure, sure.

364
00:53:49,579 --> 00:53:53,804
[SPEAKER_17]: Do you want to, well, I just, from the chair, if I may, I'll be brief.

365
00:53:53,904 --> 00:54:04,318
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, Dr. Glusi, those are great remarks and you've summed up some of what Member Intopper and Member Brinley have done and added to this committee.

366
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:18,396
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there's a much longer list because it's been two busy years and you both are extremely sincere in wanting to do what is best for the teachers and the students of the Medford Public Schools.

367
00:54:18,477 --> 00:54:20,139
[SPEAKER_17]: It shows in every comment you make.

368
00:54:21,421 --> 00:54:26,067
[SPEAKER_17]: event you go to, every post you write, we're going to sorely miss you.

369
00:54:26,447 --> 00:54:33,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Your perspectives were wonderful to have on this committee, and I hope you don't go away for good.

370
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:35,018
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope you come and add.

371
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:44,083
[SPEAKER_17]: what you can to meetings when you have available time and help guide us in the work we are gonna continue to do over the next two years.

372
00:54:44,903 --> 00:54:53,726
[SPEAKER_17]: Best of luck in everything you choose to do further and thank you for everything you've done for the school committee and the school district and the students of our community.

373
00:54:56,887 --> 00:54:57,548
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Branley.

374
00:55:03,470 --> 00:55:04,310
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, mine's not short.

375
00:55:05,307 --> 00:55:06,948
[SPEAKER_15]: but I don't think you'd expect anything different.

376
00:55:08,008 --> 00:55:12,170
[SPEAKER_15]: So, step up or step down.

377
00:55:13,831 --> 00:55:19,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Three years ago this week, my then 16-year-old daughter spoke those words on her birthday right there at that podium.

378
00:55:20,334 --> 00:55:24,956
[SPEAKER_15]: It feels like a lifetime has passed, yet some days it feels like yesterday.

379
00:55:25,676 --> 00:55:26,637
[SPEAKER_15]: I promised I wouldn't cry.

380
00:55:30,138 --> 00:55:33,040
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess you could say her words spoke to me, and I did just that.

381
00:55:34,921 --> 00:55:36,822
[SPEAKER_15]: I stepped up and I ran for office.

382
00:55:37,803 --> 00:55:43,206
[SPEAKER_15]: I won't rehash the weeks that led up to those words at the podium, but I will say it changed our lives forever.

383
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:48,149
[SPEAKER_15]: And for those of you that were here by our side then, I hope it's something you'll never forget either.

384
00:55:49,850 --> 00:56:01,037
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm still that mama bear who left no stone unturned in ensuring safety for my child and in turn becoming a mama bear for all of Medford Public Schools.

385
00:56:04,038 --> 00:56:05,199
[SPEAKER_15]: I still said I wouldn't cry.

386
00:56:05,219 --> 00:56:12,542
[SPEAKER_15]: I care, and that doesn't get taken away as I move out of this seat.

387
00:56:13,882 --> 00:56:20,826
[SPEAKER_15]: I have given all of me to the city in the last three years, and especially as a school committee member the last two years.

388
00:56:22,987 --> 00:56:30,150
[SPEAKER_15]: I have listened, I have trusted, been trusted, and I have spoken up, and I have shown up for all of Medford.

389
00:56:31,783 --> 00:56:48,252
[SPEAKER_15]: I am proud of my term in office, and I have brought a perspective no one else has from the point of view as a para, as an administrative assistant, as a mom, as a former student, and as a diehard, true to the core, lifelong Medford Mustang.

390
00:56:50,293 --> 00:56:53,995
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I have finally convinced my kids I truly do bleed the blue and white.

391
00:56:56,977 --> 00:57:00,659
[SPEAKER_15]: You can take the girl out of Medford, but you can never take Medford out of the girl.

392
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:05,642
[SPEAKER_15]: I love you Medford, more than what is healthy at times.

393
00:57:07,384 --> 00:57:10,826
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I think at this point we all know that this is not the Medford that we grew up in.

394
00:57:13,608 --> 00:57:15,068
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a plus and a minus to that.

395
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:20,852
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to grow and evolve with the times, yet many of us Mustangs aren't really loving the changes that have been made.

396
00:57:21,893 --> 00:57:22,934
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to meet in the middle.

397
00:57:23,554 --> 00:57:26,376
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to make progress without being so progressive.

398
00:57:27,937 --> 00:57:29,638
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to be kind and we need to listen.

399
00:57:30,732 --> 00:57:36,938
[SPEAKER_15]: Three years ago today, today at the same podium my daughter spoke at, I spoke out at a city council meeting.

400
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:46,527
[SPEAKER_15]: And in my closing remarks, I said that communication in this city is key and it's something the city still struggles with and we need to work on.

401
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,901
[SPEAKER_15]: I have never aspired to be a politician.

402
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:56,023
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've been grateful for the two years that I've kept true to my values.

403
00:57:57,003 --> 00:58:07,448
[SPEAKER_15]: I am beyond grateful for the discussions I've had with our school staff, families, and students off the record, that I've been trusted with your concerns, as I truly hope I have served you well.

404
00:58:09,328 --> 00:58:12,850
[SPEAKER_15]: I was never here for me, but for each and every one of you.

405
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:31,553
[SPEAKER_15]: and I'm empathetic to a fault, and I've put myself in your shoes during every executive session, every motion on the floor, every vote, every budget meeting, every email I have responded to, and every single event I have walked into.

406
00:58:34,114 --> 00:58:40,075
[SPEAKER_15]: To our incredible staff, each and every one of you, know that I have seen your hard work,

407
00:58:42,933 --> 00:58:53,436
[SPEAKER_15]: I have seen your exhaustion, your struggle to feel valued, and I hope you know I have seen each and every one of you give incredible contributions to this district.

408
00:58:54,957 --> 00:58:58,038
[SPEAKER_15]: So if no one told you today, please listen up.

409
00:59:00,258 --> 00:59:00,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

410
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:03,799
[SPEAKER_15]: You are difference makers.

411
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:09,461
[SPEAKER_15]: You are supporting our children, and there is no, nothing more important than that.

412
00:59:11,053 --> 00:59:22,978
[SPEAKER_15]: A special thank you to our CTE staff that took Jacqueline, myself, and now Dominic in their protective wings and supported us so incredibly deeply.

413
00:59:24,499 --> 00:59:32,182
[SPEAKER_15]: You are incredible human beings and your dedication to our students and to your crafts are the crown jewel of Method Public Schools.

414
00:59:33,223 --> 00:59:35,944
[SPEAKER_15]: I am so grateful to forever be part of the Volk family.

415
00:59:39,697 --> 00:59:43,065
[SPEAKER_15]: To my fellow school committee members, thank you all for your hard work.

416
00:59:44,158 --> 00:59:49,803
[SPEAKER_15]: I have publicly said that our job is not just two meetings a month and we collect a paycheck.

417
00:59:50,043 --> 00:59:51,524
[SPEAKER_15]: It is 24-7.

418
00:59:53,426 --> 00:59:54,707
[SPEAKER_15]: It's hundreds of emails.

419
00:59:54,987 --> 00:59:56,168
[SPEAKER_15]: It's invitations.

420
00:59:56,989 --> 00:59:58,210
[SPEAKER_15]: It's donation requests.

421
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:01,713
[SPEAKER_15]: It's events during our full-time workday that need our attention.

422
01:00:02,453 --> 01:00:03,654
[SPEAKER_15]: It's subcommittee meetings.

423
01:00:03,814 --> 01:00:04,735
[SPEAKER_15]: It's Zoom meetings.

424
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:05,996
[SPEAKER_15]: It's negotiations.

425
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:06,997
[SPEAKER_15]: It's spreadsheets.

426
01:00:07,077 --> 01:00:07,838
[SPEAKER_15]: It's contracts.

427
01:00:07,898 --> 01:00:08,378
[SPEAKER_15]: It's bills.

428
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,019
[SPEAKER_15]: It's payroll.

429
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:12,762
[SPEAKER_15]: A multitude of emergencies, et cetera, et cetera.

430
01:00:13,785 --> 01:00:21,427
[SPEAKER_15]: To the mayor, to the superintendent, thank you both for being always open to candid discussion with me.

431
01:00:22,247 --> 01:00:27,769
[SPEAKER_15]: I may have also given you no choice and I appreciate you both always for listening.

432
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:34,291
[SPEAKER_15]: You can change your telephone numbers now or you can choose to still have me chirp in your ears.

433
01:00:35,791 --> 01:00:43,233
[SPEAKER_15]: As a woman, I applaud you both for your strength as our school leader and as our city leader.

434
01:00:44,537 --> 01:00:46,078
[SPEAKER_15]: Young girls are watching you.

435
01:00:48,379 --> 01:00:55,323
[SPEAKER_15]: Please never forget where you came from and that Mustang pride I carry in me is in both of you.

436
01:00:56,044 --> 01:00:58,865
[SPEAKER_15]: So please let it guide you to do what is right for all of Medford.

437
01:01:00,246 --> 01:01:03,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Dr. Galusi, as you said, we have come full circle, girl.

438
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:09,632
[SPEAKER_15]: You hired me as a para when you were principal Galusi at the Brooks.

439
01:01:10,552 --> 01:01:14,195
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe your words were, you've already volunteered so much, you might as well just work here.

440
01:01:18,058 --> 01:01:20,961
[SPEAKER_15]: You started my career in public education, so thank you.

441
01:01:21,661 --> 01:01:30,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Once a B, always a B. I wish you luck as you finish your term as interim superintendent and your future with Medford Public Schools.

442
01:01:31,509 --> 01:01:33,531
[SPEAKER_15]: The Mustang moment should never go away.

443
01:01:34,532 --> 01:01:38,235
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank you for bringing the students and their successes to us each meeting this year.

444
01:01:40,573 --> 01:01:44,394
[SPEAKER_15]: To our city council, I beg of you to support our school's needs in full.

445
01:01:45,474 --> 01:01:49,295
[SPEAKER_15]: I will advocate for a new Medford High School, whether it's a rebuild or a remodel.

446
01:01:50,035 --> 01:01:53,315
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to pass a debt exclusion for the future of Medford Public Schools.

447
01:01:53,855 --> 01:01:58,256
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank those that have worked tirelessly on this multi-layered, multi-year project.

448
01:02:00,957 --> 01:02:07,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Intoppa, I want to publicly thank you for your friendship the last two years.

449
01:02:11,275 --> 01:02:13,916
[SPEAKER_15]: We did not lose this election, Medford did.

450
01:02:15,977 --> 01:02:20,759
[SPEAKER_15]: There is a huge chunk of this city not being represented now, and for that my heart truly breaks.

451
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:24,901
[SPEAKER_15]: I have been incredibly proud to serve with you.

452
01:02:27,483 --> 01:02:29,323
[SPEAKER_15]: We have gone to so many events together.

453
01:02:29,924 --> 01:02:32,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Our event selfies became a joke amongst your siblings.

454
01:02:34,873 --> 01:02:41,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Then I made them take a selfie with me, so they'd stop being so clearly jealous and just shut them up once and for all.

455
01:02:43,435 --> 01:02:52,436
[SPEAKER_15]: Your parents have raised an amazing young man in you, and I know them both, so it's kind of questionable that you guys are so well, but it's really great, so thank you.

456
01:02:52,456 --> 01:03:00,738
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have to say that your perspective has been key in moving policies forward, and I thank you for that.

457
01:03:01,738 --> 01:03:02,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Your random rambles

458
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:16,216
[SPEAKER_15]: have also left me wondering what the motion even was, but just as I would question it in my own head, it would seem to dawn on you that you were also rambling, and you'd wrap up just as quick.

459
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:22,520
[SPEAKER_15]: I officially named us Brantapa at one point, and I can show you that will never change.

460
01:03:24,581 --> 01:03:26,862
[SPEAKER_15]: Lastly, to my village of personal supporters,

461
01:03:28,448 --> 01:03:33,209
[SPEAKER_15]: You've carried me through this life, and for every one of you, I thank you.

462
01:03:33,229 --> 01:03:34,509
[SPEAKER_15]: It will never be enough.

463
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:38,410
[SPEAKER_15]: I always say that two things in my life have never let me down.

464
01:03:38,430 --> 01:03:40,570
[SPEAKER_15]: It's my faith and my children.

465
01:03:42,111 --> 01:03:48,632
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to thank both Jacqueline, who I know is watching online, and Dominic, who's here, for their support.

466
01:03:50,072 --> 01:03:52,133
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you've made the ultimate sacrifices for me.

467
01:03:53,593 --> 01:03:55,033
[SPEAKER_15]: They truly have had to share me.

468
01:03:56,254 --> 01:03:57,494
[SPEAKER_15]: The last two years with this city,

469
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:04,819
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thank you both so deeply for joining me at so many events and allowing me the time to go.

470
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:10,643
[SPEAKER_15]: You both have always come first, and I hope I have set a good example to you both.

471
01:04:12,044 --> 01:04:14,665
[SPEAKER_15]: You truly can do anything you put your mind to.

472
01:04:17,227 --> 01:04:22,530
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had multiple lives as your mom, but you both have been my constant.

473
01:04:23,531 --> 01:04:24,211
[SPEAKER_15]: I love you both.

474
01:04:24,231 --> 01:04:26,933
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank you all for listening.

475
01:04:28,313 --> 01:04:34,735
[SPEAKER_15]: And as this chapter closes for me, it's on to the next chapter, because my story does not end here.

476
01:04:35,775 --> 01:04:36,115
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

477
01:04:47,899 --> 01:04:48,879
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Member Branley.

478
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:49,539
[SPEAKER_17]: That was beautiful.

479
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,040
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Intoppa.

480
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:55,660
[SPEAKER_17]: He's so good off the cuff.

481
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,122
[SPEAKER_17]: He's so good off the cuff, so we'll see.

482
01:04:58,162 --> 01:04:59,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't prepare a thing.

483
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:04,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't prepare a thing, as I usually don't, as member Branley said with the rambles.

484
01:05:04,468 --> 01:05:05,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll try not to.

485
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:09,913
[SPEAKER_02]: I timed it on my way leaving work today, and it's not that long.

486
01:05:09,973 --> 01:05:13,716
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually, I forget everything I said, because now the camera's here.

487
01:05:13,736 --> 01:05:17,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to top that.

488
01:05:18,101 --> 01:05:18,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

489
01:05:21,487 --> 01:05:25,450
[SPEAKER_02]: This time has been hectic, as it's been for a lot of us.

490
01:05:26,771 --> 01:05:31,295
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'd like to say that, first of all, this is also the moral status award show.

491
01:05:31,515 --> 01:05:36,039
[SPEAKER_02]: We get a little trophy, and then we say remarks, and then now we have to cry about it.

492
01:05:36,099 --> 01:05:36,399
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fine.

493
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:38,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I have little trophies here.

494
01:05:38,641 --> 01:05:39,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Ma.

495
01:05:40,222 --> 01:05:41,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Leo 3D modeled this.

496
01:05:42,003 --> 01:05:42,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, rambling.

497
01:05:42,944 --> 01:05:45,866
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wiping my tears with a Dunkin' napkin from five years ago.

498
01:05:48,883 --> 01:05:49,463
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

499
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:53,305
[SPEAKER_02]: This has just been an amazing experience.

500
01:05:54,645 --> 01:05:59,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Ever since when I decided to run at 18, we joked about it.

501
01:06:00,067 --> 01:06:01,528
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a fight at the dinner table.

502
01:06:02,308 --> 01:06:06,830
[SPEAKER_02]: I was mad about something, God knows what, and I said, I'm going to run for this.

503
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:09,591
[SPEAKER_02]: And my mom said, run for school committee first.

504
01:06:10,291 --> 01:06:12,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, how old do you have to be?

505
01:06:12,353 --> 01:06:14,474
[SPEAKER_02]: And my mom texted the mayor.

506
01:06:14,494 --> 01:06:15,155
[SPEAKER_02]: And the mayor was like, 18.

507
01:06:15,275 --> 01:06:16,736
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, I'm pulling papers tomorrow.

508
01:06:16,796 --> 01:06:17,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And we all thought it was funny.

509
01:06:17,797 --> 01:06:23,721
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on Facebook, there was a photo of me with the packet in cargo shorts and Timberland boots for some reason.

510
01:06:25,302 --> 01:06:26,563
[SPEAKER_02]: And I started my journey there.

511
01:06:26,663 --> 01:06:31,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just been an amazing journey of advocacy and work.

512
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:35,290
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't thank my support systems enough, my family, for being.

513
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:36,211
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked at them.

514
01:06:36,251 --> 01:06:36,991
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't have done that.

515
01:06:40,231 --> 01:06:44,655
[SPEAKER_02]: God, my family for just being there always.

516
01:06:44,675 --> 01:06:47,018
[SPEAKER_02]: I sound like Kermit.

517
01:06:47,038 --> 01:06:58,310
[SPEAKER_02]: For whatever it is, for every sacrifice they made on knocking on doors and putting up signs and figuring out strategically how we can

518
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:02,293
[SPEAKER_02]: how we can run it, for my grandmother for being my biggest cheerleader.

519
01:07:02,693 --> 01:07:08,577
[SPEAKER_02]: She has like three jackets now that just say John on top of school committee, which has been great to see.

520
01:07:09,598 --> 01:07:14,522
[SPEAKER_02]: My girlfriend Sophia for dealing with it all and seeing how this has affected me.

521
01:07:14,562 --> 01:07:21,667
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really could not have asked, I'll say it again, for an amazing year and a half, I think it's been, because I came in in March.

522
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:29,515
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been on borrowed time, and I know I've been on borrowed time, but I've treated every single meeting and every single invite like it's been the last.

523
01:07:31,056 --> 01:07:33,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think what saddens me is now that I don't have the choice for that.

524
01:07:34,439 --> 01:07:35,139
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the last.

525
01:07:35,419 --> 01:07:41,904
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've always wanted to do what I can, and understanding that I won't understand everything.

526
01:07:42,785 --> 01:07:49,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's sort of a spin-on of a quote from NYC Mayor-elect Zohra Mamdani, you know,

527
01:07:50,150 --> 01:08:05,460
[SPEAKER_02]: What I've lacked in experience, I've always tried to make up for in integrity and to make sure that I'm always hearing things from every angle and trying to fight for the progression of the Medford Public Schools and trying to be there representing the little me's, especially, you know, the little anxiety ridden balls of

528
01:08:07,233 --> 01:08:21,178
[SPEAKER_02]: anxiety that were elementary schoolers touching handrails and worrying they were going to go into anaphylactic shock and talking about how to advocate for allergy awareness and how to advocate for the arts to make sure we stay a strong district culturally, because that is where the sense of belonging falls in the

529
01:08:22,925 --> 01:08:39,180
[SPEAKER_02]: extracurriculars, and the way that that's what got me through the Medford Public Schools, that's what got my sister Lacey through the Medford Public Schools, and it's getting my little brother Leo through the Medford Public Schools, is involvement in all three, the athletics, the arts, and academics, and how those three A's intersect into forming a more perfect, you know, student.

530
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:46,587
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no such thing as a perfect student, but we heard it from our orchestra earlier today about how, you know, those

531
01:08:47,446 --> 01:08:52,029
[SPEAKER_02]: The tangible things they learn in the arts helps them be better students.

532
01:08:52,049 --> 01:09:03,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And former director of fine arts, Mr. Zigney, used to always champion for the orchestra to be first period, because he said it unlocked more potential in us as students, and lost his mind when they moved it to second period for one year.

533
01:09:03,397 --> 01:09:05,298
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the next year, it was the first period.

534
01:09:05,318 --> 01:09:08,721
[SPEAKER_02]: So he must have lost it enough that it came back.

535
01:09:12,988 --> 01:09:15,630
[SPEAKER_02]: but just everything, the experience that this has been.

536
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:19,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I also wanna thank my employer, MassArt, for teaching me all these things.

537
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:30,140
[SPEAKER_02]: When I lost at 18, I decided to join the board of trustees and I was a full-fledged member of the board of trustees at 18 and working on college policy and getting us through the pandemic.

538
01:09:30,180 --> 01:09:32,482
[SPEAKER_02]: And the college really invested me as a student leader.

539
01:09:32,562 --> 01:09:37,386
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I get to do the same thing every day working in the student engagement office.

540
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:39,787
[SPEAKER_02]: I have eight amazing students that I,

541
01:09:40,688 --> 01:09:59,154
[SPEAKER_02]: oversee and work with and try to, you know, meet them where they're at and try to make just this, make them the student leaders and adults in the world that we need and to be better people and to work together and form that teamwork like our students in the orchestra said, because we're all in this together.

542
01:09:59,314 --> 01:10:01,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I used to use this quote a lot.

543
01:10:02,673 --> 01:10:07,175
[SPEAKER_02]: As a former rower, if the eight knuckleheads in the boat can't get their stuff together, you're not moving anywhere.

544
01:10:07,596 --> 01:10:08,756
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll move backwards sometimes.

545
01:10:08,776 --> 01:10:10,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, Olapade knows what I'm talking about.

546
01:10:10,417 --> 01:10:12,418
[SPEAKER_02]: You will, in fact, move backwards, because that's physics.

547
01:10:12,558 --> 01:10:13,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently.

548
01:10:13,158 --> 01:10:13,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that.

549
01:10:13,779 --> 01:10:14,639
[SPEAKER_02]: My sister's in STEM.

550
01:10:19,721 --> 01:10:20,642
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just an art major.

551
01:10:21,302 --> 01:10:21,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Design, whatever.

552
01:10:24,562 --> 01:10:25,162
[SPEAKER_02]: They really need it.

553
01:10:25,202 --> 01:10:26,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a time clock.

554
01:10:26,103 --> 01:10:27,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I really need a time clock.

555
01:10:27,164 --> 01:10:27,544
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

556
01:10:27,564 --> 01:10:29,905
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the last time I'm sitting here and saying what I want, so it's fine.

557
01:10:31,486 --> 01:10:32,407
[SPEAKER_02]: But I wish for the best.

558
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm optimistic about the future.

559
01:10:33,948 --> 01:10:40,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to, you know, I'm sad that I can't continue this work with you all, to the new members, to the current members.

560
01:10:41,793 --> 01:10:47,297
[SPEAKER_02]: as much as I pull my hair out sometimes, and it's coming out, I do love this work.

561
01:10:47,477 --> 01:10:49,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love working with our students.

562
01:10:49,338 --> 01:10:51,479
[SPEAKER_02]: I love working with our faculty and our staff.

563
01:10:51,579 --> 01:10:54,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when we talk about sense of belonging, we're not just talking about the students.

564
01:10:54,881 --> 01:10:56,762
[SPEAKER_02]: We are talking about the staff and faculty.

565
01:10:57,143 --> 01:11:04,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we talk about building a new high school and working towards, you know, one of the questions I got was, can you have the fanciest facilities

566
01:11:04,547 --> 01:11:13,491
[SPEAKER_02]: But that doesn't always mean that you're going to have better outputs and that we need to make sure that they meet the needs of our faculty and staff to do their jobs, to make sure that they can help.

567
01:11:13,691 --> 01:11:17,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you have that sense of belonging with them, then you can unlock that sense of belonging with our students.

568
01:11:19,554 --> 01:11:21,195
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been a childhood dream of mine.

569
01:11:22,841 --> 01:11:25,083
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how you know I'm wrapping it up, because I have a post-it note about that.

570
01:11:25,884 --> 01:11:29,727
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been an absolute childhood dream of mine, to be here, to sit here.

571
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:33,972
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the people that have sat in these seats have been hugely influential.

572
01:11:33,992 --> 01:11:38,236
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we joke that I'm the only one out of my siblings with an accent sometimes, because I hung around them too long.

573
01:11:40,209 --> 01:11:55,596
[SPEAKER_02]: because they mentored me through my first run, whether it was Councilor Falco, former member Kreatz, former member Van der Kloot, member Ruseau, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, Councilor Scarpelli, all invested in me at 18, and I just want to pay that back.

574
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:03,467
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm hopeful, and I'm looking forward to continue my work in the Med for Public Schools as much as I can.

575
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:15,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already told the arts and the nurses, you have me, because I truly believe that I want to continue this work and to continue being the advocate that I can.

576
01:12:17,897 --> 01:12:21,319
[SPEAKER_02]: to member Branley, as you mentioned, because you called me out, I'm calling you out now specifically.

577
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:30,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for always being sort of my, many may not believe this, but member Branley is actually my anger translator.

578
01:12:30,505 --> 01:12:34,648
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever seen the key and peels, but sometimes I lose my mind and then that helps me be a little more.

579
01:12:35,368 --> 01:12:36,769
[SPEAKER_02]: focused in person.

580
01:12:36,789 --> 01:12:50,836
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, Emily and I, we've shared a lot of times being at events and sharing a lot of laughs and running the track at the Gancher Center, by the way, which was crazy to have like a student with like a piece of paper flame walk through in the act all serious and be like, this is cool.

581
01:12:50,856 --> 01:12:51,816
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause it was really cool.

582
01:12:52,497 --> 01:12:53,037
[SPEAKER_02]: It was raining.

583
01:12:53,077 --> 01:12:53,797
[SPEAKER_02]: I was soaking wet.

584
01:12:53,837 --> 01:12:56,078
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awful, but it was a really good time.

585
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:01,381
[SPEAKER_02]: But thank you for always being there, being one of the first people to call me like what's going on.

586
01:13:01,441 --> 01:13:03,422
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Maryland current, thank you for,

587
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:09,695
[SPEAKER_02]: figuring out so many logistics, because I think I'm safe to say this is one of the first times this has happened in this plan of government.

588
01:13:10,055 --> 01:13:14,216
[SPEAKER_02]: My story of coming in in the middle of it and what do we do about that?

589
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:18,337
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you to the charter committee for figuring that out as well and putting that in the new charter.

590
01:13:18,457 --> 01:13:22,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, because hopefully this won't happen again, but I'm thankful for that.

591
01:13:22,879 --> 01:13:28,020
[SPEAKER_02]: And also to Mayor McLaughlin for reaching out and helping coach me through that as well.

592
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:29,661
[SPEAKER_02]: But I leave you all with a quote.

593
01:13:30,741 --> 01:13:32,602
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said this quote,

594
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:35,982
[SPEAKER_02]: at my high school graduation, but it's applied.

595
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:41,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's if you ever stopped doing what you loved, and this is speaking to everyone in the district and everyone here.

596
01:13:41,947 --> 01:13:47,030
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever stopped doing what you loved because you thought quitting was your only choice at the time, I've got news for you.

597
01:13:47,411 --> 01:13:48,291
[SPEAKER_02]: You can begin again.

598
01:13:48,812 --> 01:13:49,672
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow your dreams.

599
01:13:50,553 --> 01:14:01,237
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's from Steve Katsos, who ran a public television out of Arlington for the longest time, and he had me on as a guest and really invested in me and my future as a young magician.

600
01:14:01,817 --> 01:14:08,039
[SPEAKER_02]: And my amendment to this quote is that when you achieve your dream, do it twice as good.

601
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:13,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Because prove to the people that doubted you that you could do it, and then some.

602
01:14:14,101 --> 01:14:14,602
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

603
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:15,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

604
01:14:27,292 --> 01:14:43,544
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have a little recognition gift for the, I wish, I'm sorry, I think it's, I think it's a symbolic gesture of your service on the school committee.

605
01:14:43,564 --> 01:14:46,346
[SPEAKER_16]: It is the, the quintessential bell.

606
01:14:48,128 --> 01:14:51,150
[SPEAKER_16]: just for you to remember fondly all of the

607
01:14:51,983 --> 01:14:56,008
[SPEAKER_16]: hard work and the dedication and the impact that you made to Medford Public Schools.

608
01:14:56,088 --> 01:14:59,833
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd like to give you this on behalf of Medford Public Schools.

609
01:15:21,575 --> 01:15:26,617
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we have a member Rousseau, then member Graham, then member Olapade.

610
01:15:29,277 --> 01:15:29,758
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham.

611
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:54,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

612
01:15:55,959 --> 01:16:01,103
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to say a quick thank you to John and Nicole for being my sidemates here.

613
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:05,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what you call this, but we've had some fun over here with broken chairs.

614
01:16:05,707 --> 01:16:13,333
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for the never-ending entertainment on this side of the chambers.

615
01:16:13,753 --> 01:16:16,195
[SPEAKER_09]: But Nicole, I just wanted to say thank you

616
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:25,393
[SPEAKER_09]: demanding that Medford change in some ways that Medford sorely needed to change for a really long time.

617
01:16:26,174 --> 01:16:29,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Your advocacy made a difference and it still does.

618
01:16:30,436 --> 01:16:39,642
[SPEAKER_09]: And John, thank you for being ready to step in when we needed you because that is a tall ask and I'm sure you were going about your day

619
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:44,785
[SPEAKER_09]: in the spring and we were like, hey, how's it going?

620
01:16:44,885 --> 01:16:45,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you join us?

621
01:16:45,886 --> 01:16:49,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And please be in time for like the worst budget in history.

622
01:16:49,748 --> 01:16:51,609
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

623
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:54,030
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for all of that.

624
01:16:55,491 --> 01:16:56,592
[SPEAKER_09]: You both are

625
01:16:57,232 --> 01:16:59,213
[SPEAKER_09]: very much entitled to a nap.

626
01:16:59,413 --> 01:17:07,918
[SPEAKER_09]: But once you're done with that, I would love for you to join us in a variety of capacities with the high school building team.

627
01:17:08,819 --> 01:17:11,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Branley is joining us on an advisory committee this week.

628
01:17:12,941 --> 01:17:15,823
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's going to be just so much work to do in the next six months.

629
01:17:15,863 --> 01:17:17,704
[SPEAKER_09]: So I appreciate any help that you can provide.

630
01:17:18,324 --> 01:17:18,745
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think

631
01:17:20,237 --> 01:17:26,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Future Medford also appreciates what you can bring to the table, not only on that, but on the middle school task force.

632
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:31,943
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's any number of other places where your inside knowledge will be super helpful.

633
01:17:32,043 --> 01:17:35,425
[SPEAKER_09]: So please join us as you can.

634
01:17:35,445 --> 01:17:36,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's really important.

635
01:17:37,546 --> 01:17:40,048
[SPEAKER_09]: This job has such a steep learning curve.

636
01:17:40,988 --> 01:17:49,593
[SPEAKER_09]: It is really impactful when people who have that sort of inside track and they know how things work can continue to show up

637
01:17:50,310 --> 01:17:58,893
[SPEAKER_09]: And my other request is call me anytime that you have priorities that you want to see us address, and we'll work together.

638
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:00,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

639
01:18:01,034 --> 01:18:01,834
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Member Graham.

640
01:18:03,194 --> 01:18:05,795
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Ruseau, then Member Olapade.

641
01:18:07,576 --> 01:18:08,036
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

642
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:12,818
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to repeat everything, but I really appreciated the

643
01:18:14,257 --> 01:18:22,548
[SPEAKER_18]: perspectives that you brought and that you challenged, not just me, all of us, whether it was an executive session or on the floor.

644
01:18:23,669 --> 01:18:28,696
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's really important that we are all not just like kumbaya and singing around a

645
01:18:30,438 --> 01:18:43,870
[SPEAKER_18]: a fire pit together, that if everything's wonderful and there's absolutely nothing that could be better in the public schools, then maybe that's a future we could get to, but I don't imagine that's a reality in a human endeavor.

646
01:18:44,871 --> 01:18:49,175
[SPEAKER_18]: So I appreciate very much that you have priorities and perspectives and that you

647
01:18:50,095 --> 01:19:06,883
[SPEAKER_18]: made them a priority for the committee, whether it was, and remember when Tapa did something that I still am very jealous about is that he has, I don't wanna say convinced, because it's true, but there's like the nurses think he's their guy.

648
01:19:06,943 --> 01:19:10,105
[SPEAKER_18]: Like I'm nobody's guy in any of the types of,

649
01:19:11,286 --> 01:19:12,788
[SPEAKER_18]: groups of people that we serve.

650
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:15,351
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm a little jealous of that.

651
01:19:17,053 --> 01:19:20,257
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe you can give me some pointers on how to do that in the future or not.

652
01:19:21,459 --> 01:19:23,562
[SPEAKER_18]: So I appreciate your time.

653
01:19:23,582 --> 01:19:24,523
[SPEAKER_18]: I know that this is,

654
01:19:26,143 --> 01:19:30,868
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not an easy job, and you both just came right at it.

655
01:19:31,028 --> 01:19:33,470
[SPEAKER_18]: So thank you so much for your service.

656
01:19:35,072 --> 01:19:41,978
[SPEAKER_18]: It was nice having you as colleagues, and as Member Graham said, you still have my phone number, so thank you.

657
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:45,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Member Ruseau.

658
01:19:45,141 --> 01:19:45,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Olapade.

659
01:19:46,863 --> 01:19:47,063
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

660
01:19:50,366 --> 01:19:50,887
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Olapade.

661
01:19:51,697 --> 01:19:52,157
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

662
01:19:52,838 --> 01:19:57,340
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it's a simple thank you to you both as individuals and as a collective in this body.

663
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,323
[SPEAKER_22]: The work that we've been able to accomplish in just two years has been enormous in my early experience.

664
01:20:03,683 --> 01:20:09,406
[SPEAKER_22]: We came in as a quad, four new members with two standing members is a big shift.

665
01:20:09,866 --> 01:20:13,888
[SPEAKER_22]: And I think we've all really approached this work as intentional as possible.

666
01:20:15,709 --> 01:20:21,633
[SPEAKER_22]: I think member Branley mentioned that a lot of the work that we do isn't always seen or known.

667
01:20:21,753 --> 01:20:28,817
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a lot of conversations with constituents and families and students trying to understand better how we can be a better system.

668
01:20:29,298 --> 01:20:33,240
[SPEAKER_22]: And that takes a lot of commitment outside and inside the workday.

669
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:38,983
[SPEAKER_22]: And so I really am appreciative of you both for doing that work and sticking with it with us.

670
01:20:39,804 --> 01:20:44,527
[SPEAKER_22]: I think it was also mentioned that there's a population in the city that feel like they're losing

671
01:20:44,947 --> 01:20:47,908
[SPEAKER_22]: some really strong voices on the committee, and I want to acknowledge that.

672
01:20:49,109 --> 01:20:54,191
[SPEAKER_22]: You are touch points for a lot of people in the community, and I want you to remain those touch points.

673
01:20:54,652 --> 01:20:59,654
[SPEAKER_22]: People are going to continue to lean on you to understand your perspective from what you've learned here thus far.

674
01:21:00,214 --> 01:21:07,016
[SPEAKER_22]: And I want us to be able to lean on you to continuing on from this point because you understand something that we may not all the time.

675
01:21:07,416 --> 01:21:15,977
[SPEAKER_22]: Your lived experience, your relationships, the bonds you formed as committee members and as members of the general public is invaluable to us.

676
01:21:16,718 --> 01:21:21,099
[SPEAKER_22]: So please, please, please continue to stay involved and engage as much as you can.

677
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:27,260
[SPEAKER_22]: I understand that it's going to be challenging because you are going to step into the next endeavors of your life.

678
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:38,567
[SPEAKER_22]: But we, I think, are very appreciative of what you've done for us, and I hope to be able to give you both phone calls and texts as I continue to grow in my position, understand where you're coming from so I can be better informed on the committee.

679
01:21:38,747 --> 01:21:39,228
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

680
01:21:40,909 --> 01:21:41,229
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

681
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:42,490
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Reinfeld.

682
01:21:46,947 --> 01:21:47,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

683
01:21:48,028 --> 01:21:50,509
[SPEAKER_08]: So a lot of what I wanted to say has been said already.

684
01:21:50,729 --> 01:21:53,690
[SPEAKER_08]: But as you know, that doesn't stop me from talking anyway.

685
01:21:54,771 --> 01:21:55,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you both.

686
01:21:55,351 --> 01:21:57,872
[SPEAKER_08]: I have learned so much working alongside you.

687
01:21:58,113 --> 01:22:12,720
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things that I really appreciate is that it is so clear that the work that you have done and are going to continue to do has been grounded in love for Medford, for Medford students, staff, teachers, everyone in Medford.

688
01:22:14,961 --> 01:22:22,626
[SPEAKER_08]: In respect, we haven't always agreed, but it is so refreshing, particularly in this day and age, to be able to disagree respectfully.

689
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:26,109
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just, I very much appreciate it.

690
01:22:26,969 --> 01:22:29,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Branley, I always know where you stand.

691
01:22:29,691 --> 01:22:40,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Your conviction and your passion are, they are out there for everyone to see, and I have learned a lot from that, and I've really appreciated having those voices side by side.

692
01:22:40,138 --> 01:22:43,320
[SPEAKER_08]: When we went out for coffee, as soon as we knew we were going to be serving together,

693
01:22:44,781 --> 01:22:52,107
[SPEAKER_08]: The conversations, I think, have really informed the little jokes we've made and the deeper conversations that we've had.

694
01:22:52,127 --> 01:22:54,268
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to carry that with me, and I appreciate it.

695
01:22:54,709 --> 01:22:59,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Intoppa, I know you and I are going to be continuing to work together, particularly on arts things.

696
01:23:00,873 --> 01:23:04,917
[SPEAKER_08]: You and I, we actually went to a brewery, and we didn't grab a beer.

697
01:23:05,857 --> 01:23:10,859
[SPEAKER_08]: We sat there and we talked about learning and what students are, and I really see you.

698
01:23:10,939 --> 01:23:18,861
[SPEAKER_08]: You're being the school committee member that your student self wanted, needed, and I think that's true for both of you.

699
01:23:19,082 --> 01:23:23,543
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to see that no matter who's sitting in those chairs.

700
01:23:23,623 --> 01:23:26,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to look out and I'm going to see that, and I know

701
01:23:26,864 --> 01:23:31,045
[SPEAKER_08]: You both did so much in Medford before you joined the school committee, and I know you're going to keep doing it.

702
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:35,006
[SPEAKER_08]: And as others have said, I hope that you will continue to be a resource.

703
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:41,367
[SPEAKER_08]: I have really, really enjoyed and appreciated learning from you, and I hope it doesn't end today.

704
01:23:41,547 --> 01:23:46,488
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for everything, and let's keep working together.

705
01:23:46,648 --> 01:23:52,089
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really been a pleasure to be in an elected body where we can have

706
01:23:53,129 --> 01:24:01,296
[SPEAKER_08]: good conversations, deep conversations, agree, disagree, and really put this community first.

707
01:24:01,336 --> 01:24:06,540
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for being part of this community and keeping me and us in your community.

708
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:07,621
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

709
01:24:07,941 --> 01:24:09,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Member Rytel.

710
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:11,945
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you again, Member Topper and Member Branley.

711
01:24:18,342 --> 01:24:24,246
[SPEAKER_17]: While we're out of order, we do have several people here for the HVAC roof project, if we could take that.

712
01:24:24,786 --> 01:24:25,367
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

713
01:24:27,308 --> 01:24:39,335
[SPEAKER_17]: McGlynn and Andrews HVAC roof project update, Kenneth Lord, Chief Operations Officer, and Tom Ellis, Sr., Vice President, New England Project Management Team at Jones, Lang, and LaSalle.

714
01:24:40,556 --> 01:24:44,058
[SPEAKER_17]: We also have Brenda Pike from Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability with us.

715
01:24:44,659 --> 01:24:44,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

716
01:24:52,674 --> 01:24:52,874
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

717
01:24:53,074 --> 01:24:53,714
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Tom Ellis.

718
01:24:53,754 --> 01:24:59,939
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I was here last year at the same time, because I recall the musical performances, which was kind of nice.

719
01:24:59,979 --> 01:25:01,420
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway.

720
01:25:01,661 --> 01:25:02,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back.

721
01:25:02,401 --> 01:25:02,962
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thank you.

722
01:25:03,422 --> 01:25:04,963
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

723
01:25:04,983 --> 01:25:08,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully, I'll be here in December of next year, closing out this job.

724
01:25:08,466 --> 01:25:08,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

725
01:25:08,966 --> 01:25:09,647
[SPEAKER_17]: Under budget.

726
01:25:09,927 --> 01:25:12,969
[SPEAKER_17]: Way under.

727
01:25:13,229 --> 01:25:17,573
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, we put together a quick update of where the project is.

728
01:25:18,290 --> 01:25:20,734
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe we can just run through the screen.

729
01:25:20,774 --> 01:25:28,745
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I had just kind of put together an overview of the project, many of the things you're well aware of.

730
01:25:29,664 --> 01:25:44,998
[SPEAKER_06]: But the main thing was to electrify the building and replace the major heating, ventilation, air conditioning systems components in the two schools which have failed or at the extended end of their life and are not performing effectively.

731
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:51,384
[SPEAKER_06]: So when the project's done, there'll still be some items that are not totally replaced.

732
01:25:51,424 --> 01:25:52,325
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not a total.

733
01:25:53,826 --> 01:26:03,090
[SPEAKER_06]: renovation of all the HVAC systems, the electrification, got most of the major systems in good, will be, when they're done, will be in good shape.

734
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:15,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there will be work that will remain after that for maintenance and whatnot, but we'll be working together with Ken and his team to outline how to deal with that.

735
01:26:15,316 --> 01:26:17,617
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be commissioning the

736
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:27,172
[SPEAKER_06]: the building and looking how these two, the old systems and new systems will talk together which is going to be a challenge but that's part of the process of doing that.

737
01:26:29,493 --> 01:26:47,563
[SPEAKER_06]: The other component that has impacted us is the MAAB and ADA requirements that at the time we were here a year ago were unknown, just kind of discovered that we had triggered a full ADA upgrade of the building and so we've,

738
01:26:48,164 --> 01:26:50,726
[SPEAKER_06]: navigated through that, through the process.

739
01:26:51,947 --> 01:26:57,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when we're done, most of the ADA items that were identified will be completed.

740
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:03,237
[SPEAKER_06]: The items that will remain will have a three-year period that the school department can complete them.

741
01:27:03,517 --> 01:27:05,318
[SPEAKER_06]: They're things like moving toilet

742
01:27:06,906 --> 01:27:09,748
[SPEAKER_06]: or toilet paper dispensers up or down a little bit.

743
01:27:09,788 --> 01:27:17,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of having the construction manager do that, the school department felt that that was something that they could do over a period of time with their own staff.

744
01:27:17,375 --> 01:27:20,397
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've kind of parsed out some of the scope of work.

745
01:27:20,698 --> 01:27:26,863
[SPEAKER_06]: But when the project's done, the two schools will be fully ADA accessible when we're done.

746
01:27:27,343 --> 01:27:29,225
[SPEAKER_06]: So next slide.

747
01:27:32,590 --> 01:27:42,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so the project, so both schools have remained occupied throughout the entire construction and so that's been the main driver of everything we've been doing with the schedule.

748
01:27:44,277 --> 01:27:48,459
[SPEAKER_06]: So the goal was to get going as quickly as possible.

749
01:27:48,479 --> 01:28:02,087
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we started in January with the initial appropriation, we did a fair amount of early procurement of HVAC equipment to move forward with as aggressive a schedule as we could possibly get.

750
01:28:02,507 --> 01:28:07,610
[SPEAKER_06]: And everything would have had to work exactly on schedule to achieve that.

751
01:28:08,090 --> 01:28:11,051
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have had some issues related

752
01:28:12,332 --> 01:28:21,198
[SPEAKER_06]: to the procurement but also to the, just the procurement process and the environment, the bidding environment.

753
01:28:21,258 --> 01:28:27,102
[SPEAKER_06]: We didn't get as good a response from the subcontractor market and so that's affected us a little bit.

754
01:28:27,122 --> 01:28:28,703
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to go out and re-bid a few things.

755
01:28:29,283 --> 01:28:40,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So and the main thing we've had to do is work together and this is one of the good advantages of the construction management or risk delivery method is that you can work together as a team.

756
01:28:40,490 --> 01:28:41,391
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a really good,

757
01:28:41,991 --> 01:28:57,224
[SPEAKER_06]: CM team, they've been very responsive to the school department and working together so that the principals, they participate in our weekly meetings and understand what the issues are so they're well-versed ahead of time on activities.

758
01:28:58,244 --> 01:29:01,667
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been doing a lot of work after hours, after school or on the weekend.

759
01:29:03,279 --> 01:29:09,442
[SPEAKER_06]: to keep the disturbance of the schools to the minimum.

760
01:29:09,642 --> 01:29:16,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, we realize the whole purpose is there to keep educating students and do the least disruption to students and staff.

761
01:29:17,506 --> 01:29:23,649
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had to pivot a little bit on the schedule as we got into the spring.

762
01:29:23,689 --> 01:29:26,831
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like we weren't quite sure we were going to have all the

763
01:29:27,565 --> 01:29:38,170
[SPEAKER_06]: equipment available to start demolition in a in-kind replacement process, which means replacing exactly the same equipment you have now with new equipment.

764
01:29:38,731 --> 01:29:54,639
[SPEAKER_06]: And we, together with both the consigli, the construction manager, and BGQ, the design team, were able to pivot a little bit and change it so that we would do a lot of rooftop equipment that would allow us to move forward on that.

765
01:29:55,159 --> 01:30:13,093
[SPEAKER_06]: And then due to the time frame we actually were able to squeeze a little bit of, with a little bit of extra effort, the last life out of the air handling equipment for both schools to be able to open school in the fall without the full project being complete.

766
01:30:13,692 --> 01:30:24,997
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we kind of changed the pace from what was an extremely compressed schedule to one that is a little bit more lengthy but it allows us a little bit more thoughtfulness.

767
01:30:25,057 --> 01:30:41,025
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're still able to work within the guaranteed maximum price contract with the CM company as we move forward because we had a fair amount of allowances and contingencies in our budget to anticipate, you know, what we might have.

768
01:30:41,185 --> 01:30:43,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I think one of the major items we talked about,

769
01:30:43,986 --> 01:30:46,252
[SPEAKER_06]: was the potential impact of tariffs.

770
01:30:47,194 --> 01:30:51,124
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've been very lucky that a lot of the equipment that we purchased early

771
01:30:52,603 --> 01:30:56,284
[SPEAKER_06]: was either in the country, so it was not impacted.

772
01:30:56,364 --> 01:31:04,527
[SPEAKER_06]: So as of January 20th, we've had zero additional cost for tariffs, which has been great.

773
01:31:04,587 --> 01:31:10,329
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're holding that contingency or the allowance within the GMP in its entirety.

774
01:31:10,629 --> 01:31:21,032
[SPEAKER_06]: So it will never be used unless we do get some type of tariff impact, but we, since the project is pretty much, I think we're like 98% bought out, we're not anticipating having

775
01:31:21,607 --> 01:31:23,249
[SPEAKER_06]: any additional impact on tariffs.

776
01:31:23,289 --> 01:31:34,819
[SPEAKER_06]: So those allowances, again, we're managing them well with the construction manager and the design team to, again, if that allowance is not used, it gets returned back to the city.

777
01:31:35,780 --> 01:31:37,301
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of the day, we do it with accounting.

778
01:31:37,661 --> 01:31:41,425
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's in the guaranteed maximum price, there's the tariff allowance.

779
01:31:41,928 --> 01:31:51,605
[SPEAKER_06]: There was premium time, which to do extra work over time in the evenings, weekends, in that summer, and it was anticipated to be a lot of work.

780
01:31:52,917 --> 01:32:09,284
[SPEAKER_06]: Since we stretch out the schedule, we'll still be able to extend the schedule and still stay within that time, premium time allowance for the extended general conditions for the contractor to be on board a little bit more and to deal with extra weekend work like this last weekend.

781
01:32:09,645 --> 01:32:15,607
[SPEAKER_06]: They brought a crane in and flew a bunch of HVAC equipment onto the roof the weekend.

782
01:32:15,687 --> 01:32:20,890
[SPEAKER_06]: So that allows us to work within the construction management risk delivery process.

783
01:32:22,485 --> 01:32:30,710
[SPEAKER_06]: here that two of the major areas that people can see that have been modified is the entry plaza for both schools.

784
01:32:31,271 --> 01:32:41,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are part of the ADA components that allowed for accessible access from parking lot all the way into the face of the building.

785
01:32:44,199 --> 01:32:47,001
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we talked about the project challenges.

786
01:32:51,022 --> 01:33:01,865
[SPEAKER_06]: the timing of the project, so we changed it from a replacing kind approach to a different type of system that was designed for rooftop units.

787
01:33:02,645 --> 01:33:08,546
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think we reviewed most of these items here in terms of the bidding requirements.

788
01:33:08,606 --> 01:33:12,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the project team has worked very well together.

789
01:33:12,087 --> 01:33:15,748
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a really good team, really good design team that is very

790
01:33:16,229 --> 01:33:26,301
[SPEAKER_06]: knowledgeable on the energy efficiency components and being able to work with both the construction manager and the trade contractors.

791
01:33:26,362 --> 01:33:32,769
[SPEAKER_06]: So we feel we've got the right team in place and we're working very well and I think that's generally

792
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:46,560
[SPEAKER_06]: So here you can see a couple of pictures of them flying some of the rooftop units on top of the roof for one of the schools there.

793
01:33:49,103 --> 01:33:55,324
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we talked about the minimum disruption to the school that remained in session.

794
01:33:56,504 --> 01:34:00,965
[SPEAKER_06]: We re-sequenced the schedule, so we're still tracking.

795
01:34:00,985 --> 01:34:07,626
[SPEAKER_06]: We're about 50% done on the guaranteed maximum price contract with the contractor.

796
01:34:08,166 --> 01:34:17,188
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll hopefully be able to have all the new components in place and operational late spring next year.

797
01:34:18,460 --> 01:34:20,842
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a couple of issues relative to some of the bidding.

798
01:34:20,862 --> 01:34:24,744
[SPEAKER_06]: The McLean roof alternate was a liquid applied roof coating.

799
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:30,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It came in substantially like four times over our estimate of what they thought it would be.

800
01:34:31,048 --> 01:34:35,571
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we've pulled that back and we're going to re-bid that separately through the school department.

801
01:34:35,952 --> 01:34:47,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Money is still in the budget to do that but we made a decision with the CM as well as that it just didn't seem to match up well with what we think the cost of the work is.

802
01:34:48,276 --> 01:34:58,964
[SPEAKER_06]: there should be because we actually only had one roof bidder and we believe that affected the pricing that came in for the alternate so we declined to take that.

803
01:34:59,844 --> 01:35:12,033
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think at the end of the day we're, the Guarantee Maximum Price Contract which is what the construction manager is working underneath is, was executed in June for $22.8 million.

804
01:35:12,453 --> 01:35:13,434
[SPEAKER_06]: We're approximately 45% complete.

805
01:35:15,390 --> 01:35:19,493
[SPEAKER_06]: And within that number, we're managing these allowances and contingencies.

806
01:35:20,073 --> 01:35:26,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Within that, and also outside of that number, we have the owner contingencies as well, which we're managing.

807
01:35:26,777 --> 01:35:36,443
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are targeting well underneath the total appropriation, but also our approved budget is well underneath the appropriation as well.

808
01:35:36,463 --> 01:35:39,404
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're targeting, trending very well right now.

809
01:35:39,484 --> 01:35:43,067
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think hopefully we'll have the right outcome

810
01:35:44,014 --> 01:35:48,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I know the mayor was looking for in terms of where our original appropriation was.

811
01:35:49,121 --> 01:35:52,847
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think that's the overview at this point.

812
01:35:52,887 --> 01:35:54,850
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if you can.

813
01:35:55,751 --> 01:35:57,153
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you have any questions we still.

814
01:35:59,197 --> 01:36:11,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just remind everyone that we have anticipated mass save incentives of about 2.2 million that will come in to the project after the project's over.

815
01:36:12,282 --> 01:36:16,464
[SPEAKER_06]: That's in addition to the ARPA funds that were already included into the project.

816
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:24,327
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's about 3.8 million in incentives and funding that is helping to support the overall project as well.

817
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:29,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

818
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:30,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

819
01:36:33,253 --> 01:36:33,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Ruseau.

820
01:36:36,616 --> 01:36:37,296
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much.

821
01:36:37,697 --> 01:36:40,579
[SPEAKER_18]: I do love hearing it coming in under us.

822
01:36:41,520 --> 01:36:47,786
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot of communities have experienced things coming in way over for new buildings.

823
01:36:48,626 --> 01:36:51,829
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody should screenshot that for those poor folks.

824
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:59,204
[SPEAKER_18]: The did we get an estimate on a total new roof.

825
01:36:59,244 --> 01:37:02,586
[SPEAKER_18]: I know we didn't do it but I don't remember it being four times as much.

826
01:37:02,986 --> 01:37:03,747
[SPEAKER_18]: But I could be wrong.

827
01:37:04,488 --> 01:37:14,295
[SPEAKER_06]: No I think the ridge we went with the liquid applied roof for McLean because it was I think approximately half the cost of a total re roof.

828
01:37:14,875 --> 01:37:20,579
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know in terms of getting a 20 plus year warranty on the coating.

829
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:23,802
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think the.

830
01:37:24,393 --> 01:37:28,956
[SPEAKER_06]: Four times cost of the liquidified roofing was more of a market condition kind of anomaly.

831
01:37:29,537 --> 01:37:41,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I mean, you know, that could always be done, but right now I think the strategy is the budget was like a million, $1.5 million for that, and we thought that that was a good number, and it came in substantially higher.

832
01:37:42,326 --> 01:37:45,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Our anticipation is when we re-bid that in a good environment,

833
01:37:47,367 --> 01:37:57,052
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, we're hoping to start the rebid in January for late summer, early fall when the CM's done with their work to have this contractor come in separately.

834
01:37:57,353 --> 01:38:02,735
[SPEAKER_06]: That'll give them enough time to do that and get good bids and good competition.

835
01:38:02,896 --> 01:38:05,597
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really what drives cost down is when you have good competition.

836
01:38:05,917 --> 01:38:06,698
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, thank you.

837
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:10,780
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham?

838
01:38:12,649 --> 01:38:13,029
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

839
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:15,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Two questions.

840
01:38:15,271 --> 01:38:22,776
[SPEAKER_09]: The first is when we think about the McGlynn roof needing to go on and then the solar projects at both schools.

841
01:38:22,856 --> 01:38:27,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you give us a rough timeline of when we would expect to see the solar on the roofs.

842
01:38:32,002 --> 01:38:32,222
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

843
01:38:32,262 --> 01:38:41,488
[SPEAKER_14]: So depending how quickly we can get the roof project started I would anticipate the solar being installed on the roof starting sometime in the fall of next year.

844
01:38:42,457 --> 01:38:50,563
[SPEAKER_09]: And is there a commissioning process to turn the panels on that is lengthy?

845
01:38:50,683 --> 01:38:55,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Or should we be expecting the panels to be live by the end of 2026?

846
01:38:56,048 --> 01:39:02,453
[SPEAKER_14]: There is an interconnection process with National Grid that can be hard to anticipate how long that will take.

847
01:39:03,854 --> 01:39:09,478
[SPEAKER_14]: So ideally, by the end of 2026, but that can't be promised yet.

848
01:39:09,727 --> 01:39:20,273
[SPEAKER_09]: And does that include expansion of the electrical service to those schools for equipment that runs in it or is that not part of the scope of what we're doing there?

849
01:39:20,333 --> 01:39:21,674
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're limits.

850
01:39:21,774 --> 01:39:29,158
[SPEAKER_09]: We have reached limits where we cannot install certain pieces of equipment in the schools because the grid cannot handle that.

851
01:39:29,238 --> 01:39:38,403
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was just curious whether that process of like creating more capacity electrical capacity for the buildings was part of the scope of

852
01:39:38,931 --> 01:39:40,052
[SPEAKER_09]: this electrification.

853
01:39:41,232 --> 01:39:48,857
[SPEAKER_14]: So my understanding is that we did not have to increase the electrical capacity at the schools in order to be able to do this project.

854
01:39:49,337 --> 01:39:56,482
[SPEAKER_14]: But we do have our engineers here who can confirm if that is the case.

855
01:39:56,882 --> 01:39:57,382
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

856
01:39:57,542 --> 01:39:57,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

857
01:39:59,003 --> 01:40:00,944
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't have to make any changes to that.

858
01:40:01,565 --> 01:40:01,685
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

859
01:40:02,548 --> 01:40:07,889
[SPEAKER_09]: And then my other question, we are in the same meeting a little bit later.

860
01:40:07,929 --> 01:40:11,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to talk about the other components of our capital plan.

861
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:18,011
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's some question about what the network closet mini splits at the McGlynn and the Andrews.

862
01:40:18,131 --> 01:40:24,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think across the district we are needing replacement of the mini splits in our network closets.

863
01:40:25,633 --> 01:40:39,086
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds like there's some question about the inclusion of that work in the scope, and it was always my impression that when we're doing this work at McGlynn and Andrews that the network closets would be part of the scope.

864
01:40:39,166 --> 01:40:41,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that correct, or is that not correct?

865
01:40:41,948 --> 01:40:43,209
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not part of the scope.

866
01:40:43,269 --> 01:40:46,472
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is whether the funding was within the budget or not.

867
01:40:51,237 --> 01:40:54,020
[SPEAKER_06]: All five schools were in the budget.

868
01:40:54,500 --> 01:41:01,188
[SPEAKER_06]: The question is the amount that was budgeted there, I think it was like $180,000 for all five schools.

869
01:41:01,629 --> 01:41:09,298
[SPEAKER_06]: And we pulled out the three elementary schools initially because the Inspector General's office was not keen on us.

870
01:41:09,978 --> 01:41:13,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Having five schools when in fact it was advertised kind of it's two schools.

871
01:41:13,900 --> 01:41:37,694
[SPEAKER_06]: So we kind of pull that apart from that For that purpose and then we're we've got the button there's money in the budget to do that As we go forward so it depends on what makes the most sense for the school if the school department wants to do them through a certain procurement process we can or we could we could do that through the through the contract the CM for just the two schools and

872
01:41:38,877 --> 01:42:02,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and I think just, I know Ken is like new to this process, sort of in the middle of all of this, but I think when we talked about network mini splits for the outside schools, the non-middle schools, those were seen as things that had to be done outside of the scope of the work that you all are doing, but that the work to do those mini splits for McGlynn and Andrews would be accomplished before we like close out this project.

873
01:42:03,388 --> 01:42:05,509
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think really my question is like,

874
01:42:07,086 --> 01:42:13,351
[SPEAKER_09]: if there is money and it's just a matter of like making sure formally it's on the radar as part of the scope, that's like one question.

875
01:42:13,751 --> 01:42:18,774
[SPEAKER_09]: If there is no money, that's a different question and it has to be reflected in our capital plan.

876
01:42:18,814 --> 01:42:20,836
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what the clarity I'm trying to get to.

877
01:42:20,856 --> 01:42:26,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently there is fund, there are funds in there for the mini splits at both schools.

878
01:42:26,660 --> 01:42:27,220
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

879
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:27,581
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

880
01:42:27,841 --> 01:42:32,024
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do have owner's contingency that is being managed well.

881
01:42:32,044 --> 01:42:36,247
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there should be enough money within the budget to take care of those two schools.

882
01:42:36,958 --> 01:42:46,928
[SPEAKER_06]: depending on whether you want to do it under the CM with their markup or be able to do it as part of a five school project and pay for those two out of this budget.

883
01:42:47,388 --> 01:42:47,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Got it.

884
01:42:47,728 --> 01:42:48,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

885
01:42:51,572 --> 01:42:52,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Reinfeld.

886
01:42:53,394 --> 01:42:54,815
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless somebody needed to answer.

887
01:42:55,115 --> 01:42:55,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Grims.

888
01:42:57,478 --> 01:43:03,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I just wanted to push back a tiny bit on the minimum disruption.

889
01:43:03,941 --> 01:43:13,647
[SPEAKER_08]: It's great that school has been able to be in session and we're not sending anyone into trailers, but my understanding is that at least in one of the buildings there has been kind of a disproportionate

890
01:43:14,487 --> 01:43:29,895
[SPEAKER_08]: noise level that might be interfering with some of the teaching on the third floor, particularly the odd-numbered rooms at the McGlynn, and so I just want to make sure, particularly as we're talking about doing solar installation in the fall, that's a lot of

891
01:43:32,024 --> 01:43:33,225
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the system.

892
01:43:34,026 --> 01:43:42,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, there have been a couple instances where there have been some noise impact noise of again working on the roof and whatnot, right?

893
01:43:42,732 --> 01:43:44,653
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not not perfect by a long shot.

894
01:43:44,733 --> 01:43:46,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, in the community has been very understanding.

895
01:43:46,494 --> 01:43:52,719
[SPEAKER_08]: They understand this is urgent work and they need the roof needs this so that water is not disrupting their classroom.

896
01:43:52,759 --> 01:43:58,363
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be worse, but I just want to make sure that we are working with the principals to end the.

897
01:43:59,063 --> 01:44:12,371
[SPEAKER_08]: school community so there's the expectation of how to manage this and when if we can optimize the timing of the work so it's not disrupting particularly the same classrooms over and over.

898
01:44:12,812 --> 01:44:23,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So the both principals have direct access to the construction managers if there's an issue they contact them directly and then they adjust the work schedule they move things around.

899
01:44:23,038 --> 01:44:26,801
[SPEAKER_08]: My understanding is some of the some of our teachers are willing to

900
01:44:27,641 --> 01:44:29,142
[SPEAKER_08]: call that in and some aren't.

901
01:44:29,282 --> 01:44:32,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So just making sure that we've built that awareness.

902
01:44:32,643 --> 01:44:38,686
[SPEAKER_07]: So they once they notify once they notify the contractor they jump right on it they adjust the scope of work they move things around.

903
01:44:39,087 --> 01:44:46,470
[SPEAKER_07]: So for instance over the winter break they're doing the really loud stuff so they can limit it you know limit the impact.

904
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:47,411
[SPEAKER_07]: But it is construction.

905
01:44:47,431 --> 01:44:47,951
[SPEAKER_07]: There is

906
01:44:48,571 --> 01:44:48,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

907
01:44:48,971 --> 01:44:55,113
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just want to make sure that the community knows what to expect in the fall if we're looking at a second year of this.

908
01:44:55,453 --> 01:44:59,995
[SPEAKER_06]: I think basically by the time we get through next summer we should be in pretty good shape.

909
01:45:00,075 --> 01:45:02,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean the goal is to have most of the work.

910
01:45:03,186 --> 01:45:18,054
[SPEAKER_06]: done and complete before school starts next year with only you know in the fall of 2006 so that it's commissioning it's troubleshooting it's coordinating with you know the old systems talking to the new systems working with the commissioning agent.

911
01:45:18,914 --> 01:45:27,679
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's that's the goal is to have the new AC system up and running in May which hopefully hopefully that gets ahead of the late May heat.

912
01:45:27,739 --> 01:45:29,020
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm excited about that.

913
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,000
[SPEAKER_06]: That's that's the goal.

914
01:45:30,180 --> 01:45:31,581
[SPEAKER_06]: The goal is to try to move forward.

915
01:45:31,981 --> 01:45:41,304
[SPEAKER_06]: We squeezed every bit of life out of the existing systems that were there with some minor changes and repairs.

916
01:45:42,024 --> 01:45:45,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now everything's on target to meet that goal.

917
01:45:45,905 --> 01:45:46,105
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

918
01:45:46,365 --> 01:45:46,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

919
01:45:49,866 --> 01:45:50,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

920
01:45:50,506 --> 01:45:51,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the presentation.

921
01:45:52,327 --> 01:45:53,207
[SPEAKER_17]: Much appreciated.

922
01:45:56,608 --> 01:45:59,489
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to revert back to regular order of business by member

923
01:46:00,869 --> 01:46:01,451
[SPEAKER_17]: Rousseau?

924
01:46:02,413 --> 01:46:04,919
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, member Graham, seconded by member Intoppa.

925
01:46:04,980 --> 01:46:05,782
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

926
01:46:06,631 --> 01:46:07,372
[SPEAKER_17]: I was opposed.

927
01:46:07,612 --> 01:46:09,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to revert has been approved.

928
01:46:10,854 --> 01:46:29,527
[SPEAKER_17]: We have our consent agenda, approval of bills and payrolls, approval of capital purchases, approval of donations, approval of grants, approval of field trips, Dartmouth Model UN Conference, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and we have approval of the meeting minutes from the strategic and capital planning subcommittee meeting on November 20th, 2025.

929
01:46:31,328 --> 01:46:37,593
[SPEAKER_17]: strategic and capital planning subcommittee meeting on December 8th, 2025, and our regular meeting December 1st, 2025.

930
01:46:38,133 --> 01:46:39,334
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a motion for approval?

931
01:46:40,795 --> 01:46:42,176
[SPEAKER_17]: By member Graham, seconded by?

932
01:46:43,877 --> 01:46:44,497
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Branley.

933
01:46:44,537 --> 01:46:45,358
[SPEAKER_17]: All those in favor?

934
01:46:47,219 --> 01:46:48,040
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

935
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,381
[SPEAKER_17]: Consent agenda has been approved.

936
01:46:51,981 --> 01:46:58,844
[SPEAKER_17]: There are no reports of subcommittees nor presentations of our Student Advisory Council or presentations of the public.

937
01:46:59,865 --> 01:47:02,906
[SPEAKER_17]: We do not have continued business, but we do have new business.

938
01:47:03,246 --> 01:47:15,432
[SPEAKER_17]: First up is offered by Member Graham 2025-38, recommendation from the strategic and capital planning subcommittee, review and approve the capital plan developed by the subcommittee through a series of meetings

939
01:47:15,952 --> 01:47:21,137
[SPEAKER_17]: held on October 14th, 2025, and November 20th, 2025, and December 8th, 2025.

940
01:47:21,778 --> 01:47:28,605
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll pass it over to you, Member, Vice Chair Graham and Ken Lord, our Chief Operations Officer.

941
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:30,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

942
01:47:31,484 --> 01:47:37,847
[SPEAKER_09]: So you all received some documents from us earlier today.

943
01:47:37,947 --> 01:47:41,729
[SPEAKER_09]: Apologies for the late submission.

944
01:47:42,410 --> 01:47:46,272
[SPEAKER_09]: But the strategic and capital planning subcommittee has met multiple times.

945
01:47:47,432 --> 01:48:02,619
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to the work that Ken has been doing to solicit input from building leaders and the maintenance team and from his trial by fire entry into the district to really sort of evolve our capital plan.

946
01:48:02,699 --> 01:48:04,640
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've done just that.

947
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,765
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think what you'll see are a couple of things that were provided to you.

948
01:48:08,965 --> 01:48:12,930
[SPEAKER_09]: One is a readout of the things that are complete or in progress.

949
01:48:12,990 --> 01:48:14,392
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll talk a little bit about that.

950
01:48:15,353 --> 01:48:21,581
[SPEAKER_09]: Then you'll see a document about our prioritized capital plan that we are recommending for approval.

951
01:48:22,762 --> 01:48:26,625
[SPEAKER_09]: There's some supporting information that comes from our facilities condition assessment.

952
01:48:26,646 --> 01:48:28,987
[SPEAKER_09]: So we heard a report about that a couple of meetings ago.

953
01:48:29,608 --> 01:48:41,797
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously at that time we heard that there's 85 million dollars worth of work to do in Medford public schools in the next five years which is incredibly daunting and what we have but what it has allowed us to do is be really

954
01:48:42,658 --> 01:48:45,720
[SPEAKER_09]: focused about what goes on our capital plan and our request.

955
01:48:46,640 --> 01:49:01,888
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you also have a memo that assuming that we approve it tonight will go to the mayor who obviously is here and the council by way of like sort of encapsulating what our capital request is to continue to make forward progress.

956
01:49:01,968 --> 01:49:09,992
[SPEAKER_09]: So just a couple of notable things on the complete and in progress projects.

957
01:49:10,752 --> 01:49:11,853
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to

958
01:49:12,350 --> 01:49:21,577
[SPEAKER_09]: report that while we are still in the middle of our HVAC project, we have fixed the flashing that causes it to rain inside the kindergarten classroom at the McGlynn.

959
01:49:22,117 --> 01:49:28,562
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm so happy to say that because I hope we don't have to hear about rain inside that

960
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:31,991
[SPEAKER_09]: on account of failed flashing again ever.

961
01:49:32,712 --> 01:49:33,472
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's exciting.

962
01:49:34,613 --> 01:49:43,819
[SPEAKER_09]: We also are in the middle of a whole slew of things made possible by some of the free cash allocations that were provided last year, including district-wide security updates.

963
01:49:44,039 --> 01:49:47,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Our freight elevator motor is just about done and is waiting for inspection.

964
01:49:49,102 --> 01:49:55,466
[SPEAKER_09]: The ADA Plaza compliance that Tom talked about just a few minutes ago.

965
01:49:56,087 --> 01:50:00,270
[SPEAKER_09]: The HVAC replacement, the solar roof, the network mini-splits, all of those things are in progress.

966
01:50:01,191 --> 01:50:19,865
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I think one of the things that is the most exciting announcement of the in-progress stuff is that we were notified by the MSBA at the end of October that they accepted all three of our statements of interest, which means that they will participate in the replacement of our roofs and HVACs at Missituk.

967
01:50:20,551 --> 01:50:26,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Roberts and Brooks and with a roughly 52 percent reimbursement rate.

968
01:50:27,032 --> 01:50:37,395
[SPEAKER_09]: So while we're shouldering the full cost of the McGlynn Andrews project we will not have to do that with our other buildings that are just as old actually as our middle schools.

969
01:50:38,235 --> 01:50:39,375
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's super exciting.

970
01:50:40,575 --> 01:50:44,276
[SPEAKER_09]: There is a process that I have been working on with the mayor and

971
01:50:45,753 --> 01:50:52,718
[SPEAKER_09]: The council to make sure that we have earmarked the funds required under MSBA for the feasibility study.

972
01:50:52,738 --> 01:50:55,641
[SPEAKER_09]: So that process works completely differently than our high school process.

973
01:50:55,901 --> 01:50:57,302
[SPEAKER_09]: We will be assigned an OPM.

974
01:50:59,284 --> 01:51:01,706
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no like bidding process that goes through all of that.

975
01:51:03,180 --> 01:51:09,522
[SPEAKER_09]: They have sequenced out the Roberts being the priority school, which we agree with, followed by Missituk and then Brooks.

976
01:51:09,962 --> 01:51:20,565
[SPEAKER_09]: And so over the next couple of years, there'll be feasibility study and schematic design done on all of them and then moving on to like the replacement of those projects.

977
01:51:21,282 --> 01:51:33,269
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in the shuffle of everything in the last couple of months I don't think we actually announced that here and I'm super excited about it because it's millions and millions of dollars of savings and work that we would inevitably need to do.

978
01:51:35,750 --> 01:51:45,716
[SPEAKER_09]: The next document that you have is a prioritized list of our what we see as our near I'll call it our near range capital plan and as you can see for

979
01:51:47,832 --> 01:51:54,963
[SPEAKER_09]: For FY 27, we have about $2 million in projects that we are recommending to move forward with.

980
01:51:56,225 --> 01:52:00,291
[SPEAKER_09]: These are all informed by the work that we did to

981
01:52:03,447 --> 01:52:28,180
[SPEAKER_09]: do the facility's condition assessment, and it has helped us prioritize what comes first, and that includes fire alarm studies and estimates for full replacement in all of our aging buildings, intercom upgrades, completing the network refresh, and then some smaller things like replacement of cafeteria tables at the McGlynn.

982
01:52:29,661 --> 01:52:37,267
[SPEAKER_09]: a paving study to understand the full scope and impact of the paving that needs to happen across the district in parking lots, et cetera.

983
01:52:38,448 --> 01:52:41,630
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we have doors and windows.

984
01:52:42,151 --> 01:52:48,096
[SPEAKER_09]: We have railing, adding railings to the Caron Theater for the rest of its useful life.

985
01:52:49,136 --> 01:52:55,842
[SPEAKER_09]: And then some seating repair at the auditoriums at McGlynn where they, because those seats are so old,

986
01:52:56,278 --> 01:52:57,539
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't just buy new seats.

987
01:52:57,640 --> 01:53:04,147
[SPEAKER_09]: You have to buy different new seats and then you can use the old parts to like replace broken parts of the seats.

988
01:53:04,647 --> 01:53:07,210
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have that on the list.

989
01:53:08,171 --> 01:53:08,792
[SPEAKER_09]: We have the

990
01:53:10,459 --> 01:53:19,462
[SPEAKER_09]: turf repair and drainage at the Brooks field which harkens back to the work that we did when my kids were at the Brooks.

991
01:53:20,302 --> 01:53:30,665
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm excited to see that on the list as well as some remediation of our bathroom stalls in various buildings.

992
01:53:31,846 --> 01:53:35,847
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got some issues with shades and window screens etc.

993
01:53:35,887 --> 01:53:35,967
[SPEAKER_09]: So

994
01:53:36,867 --> 01:53:47,694
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a whole slew of things here, and what that means, I think, in total is that the ask for FY27 is a capital request of about $2 million.

995
01:53:48,255 --> 01:53:53,218
[SPEAKER_09]: There were two small things on the list that were duplicated that Ken pointed out.

996
01:53:54,026 --> 01:53:56,288
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just lost my note about what it was.

997
01:53:57,149 --> 01:54:02,154
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a duplication of a $50,000 item that's been obviously removed.

998
01:54:03,155 --> 01:54:05,758
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there was a duplication of something that was not yet quoted.

999
01:54:08,121 --> 01:54:09,362
[SPEAKER_09]: But like a duplicate anyway.

1000
01:54:09,902 --> 01:54:11,364
[SPEAKER_09]: So the other thing that we are.

1001
01:54:13,018 --> 01:54:31,887
[SPEAKER_09]: suggesting that this committee approves tonight is directive to the district to apply to the CPC for bike rack modernization at the Brooks, the Roberts, and the Missituk, and a historic assessment of the front stairwell at the Curtis Tufts, which I believe we approved last year and did not materialize.

1002
01:54:32,607 --> 01:54:37,230
[SPEAKER_09]: And then finally, a playground feasibility study that would impact

1003
01:54:38,750 --> 01:54:55,918
[SPEAKER_09]: the Missittuck, Roberts and Brooks playgrounds to understand the scope and scale of what is possible and needed in those 3 places with the idea that at the Roberts at least we're also including the substantial space constraints that exist there.

1004
01:54:55,958 --> 01:55:06,863
[SPEAKER_09]: So the vision is that we would submit 3 feasibility studies to the CPC wanting them to sort of green light them all so we could do a project that sort of lays out what is possible there.

1005
01:55:08,749 --> 01:55:21,761
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the memo that you have is just a summary so that if you don't want to read the like hundreds of pages of facilities conditions assessments that you can understand what we're asking for.

1006
01:55:21,821 --> 01:55:28,287
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously we'll fill in some of the X's once this body takes a vote.

1007
01:55:28,407 --> 01:55:30,549
[SPEAKER_09]: But really to try to help

1008
01:55:32,152 --> 01:55:37,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Prioritize that over the last couple of years there have been substantial improvements made to our buildings.

1009
01:55:38,217 --> 01:55:45,563
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been major projects underway to start to remediate some of the things that have been deferred for too long.

1010
01:55:46,969 --> 01:55:55,111
[SPEAKER_09]: and that the facilities condition assessment was like part of that process to really get our arms around that and that it did indeed identify $84 million in need.

1011
01:55:56,151 --> 01:56:11,354
[SPEAKER_09]: And then to say that our capital request, while we don't take it lightly, that it is $2 million, that that's over and above what our ordinary repair and maintenance lines can support in our school budget and they are in fact one-time costs.

1012
01:56:12,959 --> 01:56:16,622
[SPEAKER_09]: And that we have made a commitment to maintaining our buildings in a more proactive fashion.

1013
01:56:16,642 --> 01:56:25,070
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have this like bubble of work that we have to get through in order to get to a place where we actually are in maintenance mode instead of like capital repair mode.

1014
01:56:26,371 --> 01:56:33,898
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the summary of the work that we have been doing on the capital planning subcommittee.

1015
01:56:33,998 --> 01:56:35,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you member Rousseau member Reinfeld.

1016
01:56:36,695 --> 01:56:37,976
[SPEAKER_09]: and Ken for all his work.

1017
01:56:38,976 --> 01:56:45,819
[SPEAKER_09]: This was a big task and an evolution of the capital planning process that we have been doing here for the last couple of years.

1018
01:56:45,919 --> 01:56:49,981
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to thank everybody who assisted with that.

1019
01:56:50,101 --> 01:56:58,265
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also to note that in addition to a formal ask for this capital, I am speaking with the city's

1020
01:56:59,085 --> 01:57:00,386
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to take any questions people have.

1021
01:57:29,249 --> 01:57:38,469
[SPEAKER_09]: I think just a motion to approve the capital request as outlined and to send this memo in its final form to the mayor and the council.

1022
01:57:39,250 --> 01:57:39,932
[SPEAKER_18]: I make that motion.

1023
01:57:41,502 --> 01:57:43,882
[SPEAKER_17]: And if there's no further comment, I'll just speak from the chair.

1024
01:57:43,902 --> 01:57:45,383
[SPEAKER_17]: This is great work.

1025
01:57:45,723 --> 01:57:51,424
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that it's perfect timing because the city is undergoing a capital improvement plan.

1026
01:57:51,444 --> 01:57:58,205
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have asked our 26 departments to provide a list just like this to us.

1027
01:57:59,865 --> 01:58:01,405
[SPEAKER_17]: Some departments have much less than others.

1028
01:58:01,425 --> 01:58:04,506
[SPEAKER_17]: A department like the fire department has six buildings.

1029
01:58:04,866 --> 01:58:07,426
[SPEAKER_17]: So their list is very extensive like this as well.

1030
01:58:07,887 --> 01:58:10,267
[SPEAKER_17]: And then on the city side, with our

1031
01:58:10,787 --> 01:58:19,673
[SPEAKER_17]: consultant from the Massachusetts Collins Center we then go and work and sometimes have to spread it out depending on the need and depending on the funding.

1032
01:58:20,053 --> 01:58:21,334
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll probably abstain.

1033
01:58:21,514 --> 01:58:27,058
[SPEAKER_17]: But obviously you know all of our buildings school and city city side our priorities.

1034
01:58:27,238 --> 01:58:28,059
[SPEAKER_17]: I've been

1035
01:58:28,539 --> 01:58:34,587
[SPEAKER_17]: big on the maintenance side and of course capital improvements need to come first but we are getting there as a whole.

1036
01:58:35,108 --> 01:58:44,339
[SPEAKER_17]: So me abstaining is some of these things may have to spread a little bit but we will make sure we are fair across the board to all 26 departments and

1037
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:50,123
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, you've outlined which are priorities, so we'll make sure those are moved up in queue.

1038
01:58:50,524 --> 01:58:56,587
[SPEAKER_17]: But as far as getting approval for X million dollars tomorrow or the next day, it is a process.

1039
01:58:56,627 --> 01:58:58,749
[SPEAKER_17]: It will probably take the next couple weeks.

1040
01:58:58,849 --> 01:59:08,815
[SPEAKER_17]: I think our consultant's on through February, and then the full capital plan for the next six years will be out, and we'll be able to better identify what will be done which year and with

1041
01:59:09,245 --> 01:59:12,007
[SPEAKER_17]: You've it's good you've identified some CPA projects.

1042
01:59:12,187 --> 01:59:15,790
[SPEAKER_17]: There's also we did receive a grant from M.O.D.

1043
01:59:15,850 --> 01:59:18,212
[SPEAKER_17]: So hopefully there'll be more funding on the A.D.A.

1044
01:59:18,653 --> 01:59:24,517
[SPEAKER_17]: accessibility side that we can apply for some of these funds and there's C.D.B.G.

1045
01:59:24,757 --> 01:59:33,004
[SPEAKER_17]: So I want to make sure all our funding sources are included and we take them into account so we can provide as much capital improvements to each department as we can.

1046
01:59:33,464 --> 01:59:33,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1047
01:59:35,326 --> 01:59:35,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1048
01:59:35,866 --> 01:59:37,527
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mayor just one more note.

1049
01:59:37,587 --> 01:59:38,028
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the.

1050
01:59:38,871 --> 01:59:48,994
[SPEAKER_09]: The ask from this body, just so that we're clear, is that the $2 million be allocated so that the work can begin on or before July 1, 2026.

1051
01:59:51,055 --> 01:59:55,777
[SPEAKER_09]: I keep saying 27, but it's FY27, which starts on July 1, 2026.

1052
01:59:57,237 --> 02:00:08,421
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think one of the things that becomes clear when you do dig in, at least on this side, with $85 million of need in the next five years, that those delays are

1053
02:00:09,225 --> 02:00:11,526
[SPEAKER_09]: are an issue for us.

1054
02:00:11,606 --> 02:00:13,626
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know there's a lot of competing priorities.

1055
02:00:13,706 --> 02:00:26,690
[SPEAKER_09]: So the ask is like wherever the money comes from that two million dollars be made available so that these priority projects can go forward in our schools for next year.

1056
02:00:26,810 --> 02:00:36,453
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would expect that the year after that like the ask is going to be just as big whether that's free cash or it's grants or like wherever the funding comes from I think is immaterial.

1057
02:00:38,355 --> 02:00:46,605
[SPEAKER_09]: to us but I think you know having safe buildings means fire alarms and intercoms and all those things that are on the list and at end of life.

1058
02:00:46,685 --> 02:00:56,816
[SPEAKER_09]: So but appreciate the appreciate the needs across the city and hopeful that we will raise revenue to meet all of the needs ASAP.

1059
02:00:59,703 --> 02:01:11,529
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to say something similar just to note that one of the things we've done is project ahead what the asks are likely to be in fiscal year 28 29 and 30.

1060
02:01:13,230 --> 02:01:13,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Well 30.

1061
02:01:13,770 --> 02:01:16,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1062
02:01:16,892 --> 02:01:17,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1063
02:01:19,333 --> 02:01:23,355
[SPEAKER_08]: But just to keep that in mind that if we don't have that allocation to start this work.

1064
02:01:24,877 --> 02:01:32,240
[SPEAKER_08]: In the next fiscal year, it's going to compound both with things getting more expensive and knowing that we have all of these projects.

1065
02:01:32,420 --> 02:01:38,022
[SPEAKER_08]: I love that we have this facilities condition assessment because we know what's coming.

1066
02:01:38,843 --> 02:01:42,744
[SPEAKER_08]: And we, and that didn't include what's happening at the high school either.

1067
02:01:42,844 --> 02:01:49,307
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to emphasize the importance of this, this money for this fiscal year to get these projects started.

1068
02:01:54,351 --> 02:01:55,092
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we need a second?

1069
02:01:55,112 --> 02:01:55,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I can second.

1070
02:01:55,472 --> 02:01:58,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion on the floor.

1071
02:01:58,494 --> 02:02:01,176
[SPEAKER_01]: Second.

1072
02:02:01,216 --> 02:02:01,597
[SPEAKER_17]: Roll call.

1073
02:02:04,919 --> 02:02:06,440
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody's getting very fast back there.

1074
02:02:07,301 --> 02:02:07,981
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Branley.

1075
02:02:08,001 --> 02:02:08,902
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1076
02:02:08,922 --> 02:02:09,443
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Graham.

1077
02:02:09,503 --> 02:02:09,723
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1078
02:02:09,903 --> 02:02:10,563
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Intoppa.

1079
02:02:10,583 --> 02:02:10,764
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1080
02:02:11,044 --> 02:02:11,744
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Olapade.

1081
02:02:11,784 --> 02:02:12,025
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

1082
02:02:12,205 --> 02:02:12,885
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Reinfeld.

1083
02:02:12,965 --> 02:02:13,185
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1084
02:02:13,426 --> 02:02:13,926
[SPEAKER_18]: Member Rossell.

1085
02:02:13,966 --> 02:02:14,146
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_18]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1087
02:02:15,227 --> 02:02:15,848
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll abstain.

1088
02:02:16,108 --> 02:02:17,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Six in the affirmative, one abstention.

1089
02:02:18,209 --> 02:02:18,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the work.

1090

[SPEAKER_17]: And whereas Tracy Keene has submitted his resignation, and whereas the Medford School Committee wishes to express its sincere appreciation for Tracy Keene's service and leadership during his tenure, now therefore be it resolved that the Medford School Committee formally acknowledges and accepts the resignation of Tracy Keene.

1092
02:03:03,104 --> 02:03:18,656

[SPEAKER_17]: As the president of NEET, a trade group of

1102
02:04:24,071 --> 02:04:26,192

[SPEAKER_17]: He worked with artist unions to develop safe return to work rules during the COVID-19 shutdown.

1108
02:04:57,161 --> 02:04:57,601
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham?

1109
02:05:02,887 --> 02:05:06,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Tracy let me know that he needed to step down.

1110
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:08,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I was really sad.

1111
02:05:08,495 --> 02:05:16,286
[SPEAKER_09]: And my first thought was, who is going to replace Tracy and all of his experience in managing

1112
02:05:17,868 --> 02:05:21,470
[SPEAKER_09]: stage construction and operation.

1113
02:05:21,490 --> 02:05:33,617
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I took a deep dive back into the original applications that we got from the hundred plus people willing to throw their hat in at the beginning as we formed the building committee.

1114
02:05:33,637 --> 02:05:42,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And I really wasn't that hopeful about it, but I thought I just had to kind of give it a shot to see if there was somebody else in there and pause.

1115
02:05:45,499 --> 02:05:49,141
[SPEAKER_09]: application jumped out at me and I was like, oh, this is amazing news.

1116
02:05:49,161 --> 02:06:09,191
[SPEAKER_09]: There actually was somebody else in this pile that I had since forgotten about that is equally qualified to understand what the performing arts needs out of new spaces and has considerable experience in the management and directing of the performing arts.

1117
02:06:09,391 --> 02:06:13,153
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that will serve the committee well and I think Paul will be

1118
02:06:14,233 --> 02:06:21,237
[SPEAKER_09]: a great asset to the committee and somebody actually able to fill Tracy's shoes, which I think Tracy will be pleased with.

1119
02:06:22,798 --> 02:06:27,140
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just wanted to say thank you to Tracy and to Paul for being willing to step up.

1120
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:35,264
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope that the work we do in the next six months on the feasibility study will really bring a new day for the arts.

1121
02:06:36,905 --> 02:06:37,785
[SPEAKER_09]: And motion to approve.

1122
02:06:38,026 --> 02:06:40,386
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion for approval by Member Graham, seconded by?

1123
02:06:40,406 --> 02:06:40,526
[SPEAKER_17]: Second.

1124
02:06:41,267 --> 02:06:42,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Olapade, all those in favor?

1125
02:06:43,067 --> 02:06:43,187
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1126
02:06:43,367 --> 02:06:44,107
[SPEAKER_17]: All those opposed?

1127
02:06:44,147 --> 02:06:44,887
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes.

1128
02:06:44,907 --> 02:07:03,371
[SPEAKER_17]: 2025-40 offered by Member Graham and Member Olapade, whereas the Medford School Committee has established a timeline for the completion of the superintendent's evaluation to ensure completion in January 2026 as a critical input for the upcoming decision to appoint a permanent superintendent on July 1, 2026.

1129
02:07:05,131 --> 02:07:13,454
[SPEAKER_17]: And whereas the contributions of all current members, including those whose terms are concluding, are essential to ensure a comprehensive and accurate evaluation process.

1130
02:07:13,994 --> 02:07:21,516
[SPEAKER_17]: And whereas outgoing members, Nicole Branley and John Intoppa, possess valuable insights from the past year that should be reflected in the final evaluation.

1131
02:07:22,116 --> 02:07:28,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee respectfully requests that outgoing members, Nicole Branley and John Intoppa,

1132
02:07:28,618 --> 02:07:33,542
[SPEAKER_17]: complete their input to the superintendent's evaluation by December 31st, 2025.

1133
02:07:34,223 --> 02:07:43,590
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it further resolved that the committee request the chair of the superintendent evaluation subcommittee to promptly share the evaluation template with all members to facilitate timely completion.

1134
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:51,536
[SPEAKER_17]: Be it therefore resolved that the committee express its appreciation for their service and contributions to the evaluation process and to the Medford Public Schools.

1135
02:07:52,277 --> 02:07:53,898
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham, or is there a motion for approval?

1136
02:07:59,347 --> 02:08:01,108
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Intoppa and then Member Olapade.

1137
02:08:03,089 --> 02:08:03,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1138
02:08:03,409 --> 02:08:03,989
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mayor.

1139
02:08:05,110 --> 02:08:05,850
[SPEAKER_02]: So, quick question.

1140
02:08:05,910 --> 02:08:13,414
[SPEAKER_02]: So, can I ask the significance of the deadline in terms of the deadline date?

1141
02:08:13,594 --> 02:08:22,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I only ask this because it is a very busy season in higher ed right now, not just in higher ed but specifically with my position currently.

1142
02:08:23,079 --> 02:08:23,940
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I want to give

1143
02:08:25,095 --> 02:08:27,776
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, a proper evaluation, and I don't want to rush it.

1144
02:08:28,917 --> 02:08:33,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And so with only, what, two weeks out, it's a little rushed.

1145
02:08:33,599 --> 02:08:36,880
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just curious about the timeline is all.

1146
02:08:38,409 --> 02:08:38,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1147
02:08:39,270 --> 02:08:39,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1148
02:08:39,731 --> 02:08:41,433
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree.

1149
02:08:42,274 --> 02:08:46,480
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think there's plenty of flexibility which I will defer to Member Olapade about.

1150
02:08:47,221 --> 02:08:54,991
[SPEAKER_09]: I think our hard deadline is that we are able to have a meeting by the end of January where we are sharing a consolidated

1151
02:08:55,992 --> 02:08:58,733
[SPEAKER_09]: evaluation of Dr. Galussi in her first year.

1152
02:08:59,953 --> 02:09:07,956
[SPEAKER_09]: If we, I think that's going to be really, really important as we consider what those next steps are between the end of January and July 1.

1153
02:09:08,376 --> 02:09:17,319
[SPEAKER_09]: So I put December 31st because that's the end of the calendar year, but it's not meant to necessarily be a hard deadline.

1154
02:09:17,339 --> 02:09:24,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the bigger thing will be that it aligns with what member Lopate needs so that he can do the compilation work.

1155
02:09:24,742 --> 02:09:25,262
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll defer to him.

1156
02:09:29,005 --> 02:09:30,366
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Ruseau?

1157
02:09:31,466 --> 02:09:32,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I'm so sorry.

1158
02:09:32,086 --> 02:09:33,187
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Olapade, then Member Ruseau.

1159
02:09:33,247 --> 02:09:35,648
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll defer to Member Ruseau for the moment.

1160
02:09:35,668 --> 02:09:36,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Ruseau.

1161
02:09:36,568 --> 02:09:36,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1162
02:09:37,809 --> 02:09:47,573
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a technical question about when outgoing members' accounts are suspended because these forms are done in Google in your school account.

1163
02:09:48,395 --> 02:09:52,096
[SPEAKER_18]: And I mean, if there's flexibility to leave them active, then that's fine.

1164
02:09:52,356 --> 02:10:01,678
[SPEAKER_18]: But if they're not, you can't be using your own personal account because then those become public records and nobody really wants that.

1165
02:10:02,518 --> 02:10:09,599
[SPEAKER_18]: So if there is flexibility, and I don't know the off-voting process, but if there is flexibility, then that is fine.

1166
02:10:09,659 --> 02:10:13,660
[SPEAKER_18]: But if there is not, then I think that date is there for a reason.

1167
02:10:16,888 --> 02:10:17,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1168
02:10:17,208 --> 02:10:17,989
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Opare.

1169
02:10:20,570 --> 02:10:20,950
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1170
02:10:21,431 --> 02:10:21,691
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1171
02:10:21,851 --> 02:10:26,273
[SPEAKER_22]: So from my understanding, the date can be flexible as needed.

1172
02:10:26,293 --> 02:10:41,102
[SPEAKER_22]: I do want to err on the side of prioritizing the evaluation because I do think that trying to have a succinct evaluation that's public before the end of January is preferential just to the timeline we're following.

1173
02:10:42,174 --> 02:10:49,404
[SPEAKER_22]: I worked with member Rousseau to understand what the previous template looked like because he was on the former superintendent evaluation.

1174
02:10:50,835 --> 02:10:51,636
[SPEAKER_22]: search and things like that.

1175
02:10:51,676 --> 02:10:53,437
[SPEAKER_22]: So he had an intimate knowledge of what that looks like.

1176
02:10:53,477 --> 02:10:56,159
[SPEAKER_22]: So I've been able to go through and look at what DESE requires of us.

1177
02:10:56,199 --> 02:11:04,405
[SPEAKER_22]: And so what will happen is that each member will put together their understanding about each individual criteria that we discussed previously.

1178
02:11:04,785 --> 02:11:08,888
[SPEAKER_22]: And then my responsibility is to then compile all those thoughts in a concise way.

1179
02:11:09,028 --> 02:11:14,332
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's more a matter of making sure that you have the time that we're requesting of you to

1180
02:11:14,932 --> 02:11:23,754
[SPEAKER_22]: put forth to the evaluation, but also giving me enough time to properly dictate those into a cohesive message to the community and to our interim superintendent.

1181
02:11:24,154 --> 02:11:27,215
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll communicate with you both.

1182
02:11:27,395 --> 02:11:37,798
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're willing to take on this responsibility, I'll communicate with you both outside of the meeting to communicate what's best for your schedules, but would prefer to stay on somewhat of a quick timeline.

1183
02:11:37,818 --> 02:11:41,859
[SPEAKER_22]: But I agree, the higher ed urgency is definitely evident as well.

1184
02:11:47,298 --> 02:11:48,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, lucky you.

1185
02:11:48,400 --> 02:11:50,903
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm talking right now.

1186
02:11:51,905 --> 02:11:52,726
[SPEAKER_02]: We're down a director.

1187
02:11:52,786 --> 02:11:54,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of, it stinks.

1188
02:11:54,168 --> 02:11:56,011
[SPEAKER_02]: No, thank you both for the insight.

1189
02:11:56,511 --> 02:11:59,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd imagine we'd be able to hopefully leave the accounts open.

1190
02:11:59,616 --> 02:12:00,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm assuming we would just have to.

1191
02:12:02,259 --> 02:12:07,443
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure we get off some of the mass email chain so that way we are not privy to information we should not be privy to.

1192
02:12:07,983 --> 02:12:08,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just more curious.

1193
02:12:08,684 --> 02:12:10,845
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, what are they going to do, fire us if we don't do it in time?

1194
02:12:12,166 --> 02:12:14,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry if that's too soon, but like what are we going to do?

1195
02:12:15,448 --> 02:12:19,831
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do want to make sure that we push the district forward and make sure that we give the time allotted obviously.

1196
02:12:20,651 --> 02:12:29,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way when, you know, you all gear up for a search or start to look at the logistics of that, we have timely insight.

1197
02:12:31,976 --> 02:12:32,296
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1198
02:12:32,436 --> 02:12:39,900
[SPEAKER_16]: And we can definitely we can definitely extend that off boarding process to keep your e-mails active.

1199
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:41,061
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not a problem at all.

1200
02:12:45,664 --> 02:12:48,645
[SPEAKER_17]: If a motion is needed a motion to approve by member Rousseau seconded by.

1201
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:56,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Branley, all those in favor?

1202
02:12:56,243 --> 02:12:57,304
[SPEAKER_17]: Aye.

1203
02:12:58,926 --> 02:13:02,431
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion passes and I believe the motion said...

1204
02:13:06,907 --> 02:13:09,389
[SPEAKER_17]: gave you the option, so I think that's fine.

1205
02:13:10,229 --> 02:13:11,310
[SPEAKER_17]: No reports requested.

1206
02:13:11,650 --> 02:13:12,651
[SPEAKER_17]: We do have a condolence.

1207
02:13:12,791 --> 02:13:27,521
[SPEAKER_17]: The members of the Medford School Committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Francis R. Frank Cangiano of Arlington, formerly of Medford, who was a dedicated and respected science teacher for Medford Public Schools for 40 years.

1208
02:13:28,962 --> 02:13:38,070
[SPEAKER_17]: We also had the passing of a parent, a young parent that I found out about today, Julie McDonald-Matterese.

1209
02:13:38,370 --> 02:13:42,714
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'd like to just add that to our list of consultances for a moment of silence.

1210
02:13:43,055 --> 02:13:46,297
[SPEAKER_17]: She was a wonderful woman with two children in the Medford Public Schools.

1211
02:13:47,178 --> 02:13:49,100
[SPEAKER_17]: If we may all rise for a moment of silence, please.

1212
02:14:05,106 --> 02:14:05,406
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1213
02:14:05,426 --> 02:14:17,717
[SPEAKER_17]: Our regular meeting, next regular meeting will be January 5th, 2026 in the Alden Memorial Chambers, Medford City Hall, in addition to Zoom.

1214
02:14:19,298 --> 02:14:24,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Have a wonderful, I know we have a, do we have one more meeting with the School Building Committee?

1215
02:14:25,477 --> 02:14:28,221
[SPEAKER_17]: on Monday, the 22nd, that's at 6.30 p.m.

1216
02:14:29,362 --> 02:14:30,203
[SPEAKER_17]: virtual only.

1217
02:14:30,623 --> 02:14:35,329
[SPEAKER_17]: Otherwise, have a wonderful holiday, depending, no matter what you celebrate, and a happy new year.

1218
02:14:36,711 --> 02:14:37,351
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, everybody.

1219
02:14:37,572 --> 02:14:39,814
