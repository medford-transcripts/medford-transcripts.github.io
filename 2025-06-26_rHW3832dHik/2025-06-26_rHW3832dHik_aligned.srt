00:00:00,351 --> 00:00:03,813
Good evening and welcome to tonight's meeting of the Memphis Community Development Board.

2
00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:05,014
I'll call the meeting to order.

3
00:00:05,995 --> 00:00:08,576
Let's begin with some obligatory procedural matters.

4
00:00:09,577 --> 00:00:13,499
This hearing of the Memphis Community Development Board is being conducted via remote means.

5
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:23,245
No in-person attendance of members of the public will be permitted, but every effort will be made to ensure that the public can adequately access the proceedings as provided for in Chapter 2 of the Acts of 2023.

The reminder that anyone who would like to listen to or view this meeting while in progress may do so by accessing the link that was included on the meeting agenda posted on the city of Medford's website.

7
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:42,398
If despite our best efforts, we are unable to provide real-time access, we will post a recording of this meeting on the city's website as soon as possible.

8
00:00:42,578 --> 00:00:47,822
A reminder that given the remote nature of this meeting, tonight all votes from the board will be made by roll call.

Please also know that the project materials for all projects before the board can be viewed on the city's website as well.

10
00:00:54,284 --> 00:01:02,105
The city's website is MedfordMA.org, and you can go under current seating board filings, and Danielle will provide that link in the chat.

11
00:01:03,226 --> 00:01:05,186
I'm going to do a roll call attendance for the board.

12
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:07,846

21
00:01:24,844 --> 00:01:26,064
Is she here?

22
00:01:28,325 --> 00:01:28,565
No.

23
00:01:30,386 --> 00:01:31,907
And myself, Jackie McPherson.

24
00:01:32,947 --> 00:01:34,908
Danielle, can you introduce any staff on the call?

25
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:43,012
Yes, there's myself, Danielle Evans, senior planner with the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

26
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:49,655
We have Alicia Hunt, who is the director of our department, and we have Clem Doucette, who is our

27
00:01:50,842 --> 00:01:51,923
graduate student intern.

28
00:01:52,843 --> 00:01:55,485
I believe that is everyone from our staff.

29
00:01:58,147 --> 00:01:58,988
Thank you very much.

30
00:01:59,008 --> 00:02:04,012
We're going to go right into the first item on our agenda, which is 290 Salem Street, which is continued from 4

31
00:02:06,146 --> 00:02:09,008
Uh, I believe this was continued from two 1324.

32
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:10,669
Is that correct?

33
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:12,029
Daniel to 13?

34
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:12,930
Yes.

35
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:22,615
It's a site plan review plus special permit to allow the construction of a three-story mixed use building to, to contain seven residential units above ground for commercial space.

36
00:02:23,856 --> 00:02:27,338
If I can please have the city staff make any introductory comments.

37
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:41,053
Yeah, so we received some revised plans from the applicant in response to concerns when they were last before you.

38
00:02:43,254 --> 00:02:50,638
So I would recommend that the applicant present those for your consideration at this time.

39
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,462
And if I can please have the applicant introduce yourselves and

40
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,783
Danielle, if you can please provide them sharing abilities, whoever is speaking.

41
00:03:04,904 --> 00:03:09,186
Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board, Adam Barnosky, 255 State Street on behalf of the applicant.

42
00:03:09,486 --> 00:03:13,328
So I'll pass it over to Jacob Levine in a moment to walk through the plans.

43
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:19,372
Just as a quick update, we did appear before the Zoning Board of Appeals about a week and a half ago.

44
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:23,374
The ZBA was supportive of the application.

45
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:40,750
And we're, I would say, on the brink of approving it, but then they thought that it would be better to make sure that the members of this board were okay with any changes and just to ensure that any changes that were made wouldn't somehow impact the zoning relief.

46
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,153
And we did reiterate that we weren't looking to make dimensional changes.

47
00:03:44,773 --> 00:03:47,175
we're fine with continuing that matter.

48
00:03:47,195 --> 00:03:51,177
So we'll be back before the ZBA next Thursday on the 28th.

49
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:58,882
And with that, I'll pass it over to Jacob to discuss the requests and changes that were made to the plans.

50
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:04,865
Good afternoon, board.

51
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:07,907
I just need access just to share my screen.

52
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:09,268
I'm Jacob from S.L.

53
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:09,728
Hoss Group.

54
00:04:10,769 --> 00:04:11,129
Thank you.

55
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:16,615
All righty.

56
00:04:17,816 --> 00:04:25,538
The last time we spoke, we were kind of all looking at the massing and the design of this building more.

57
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,660
More importantly, this corner that is on Park Street and Salem Street.

58
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:33,663
and just the overall massing appeal of the building.

59
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:39,165
So we went back and did a little bit of homework on that and tried to listen to some of your comments.

60
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:47,949
We also included a few more renderings, a few more drawings, a shadow study, a solar update, and a little bit more information on the dumpster.

61
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:53,792
So I am going to flip through these drawings and then we will answer any questions that come about.

62
00:04:54,332 --> 00:05:01,015
I just wanna be clear, the floor plans have not changed except for some balconies on now the Park Street side,

63
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:07,531
but in terms of square footage and how it sits on the ground floor, that has not changed.

64
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:18,558
We also went ahead and updated with our new landscape plan into the architectural drawing as well, so you can get a little bit more of an understanding of how lush and green it would be.

65
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:22,541
So with that, I'm gonna start moving through this small presentation of drawings.

66
00:05:24,702 --> 00:05:29,786
So one change that we made was on Park Street, we went with balconies,

67
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:33,358
and alleviated before we had a balcony on the corner.

68
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:40,503
We discussed with you last time the idea of having transparency on this corner versus massing.

69
00:05:41,403 --> 00:05:44,806
And we felt that we wanted to hold the corner but still have it transparent.

70
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:50,690
And you guys recommended that we do a little bit more study into that corner itself, which we did.

71
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:56,194
I do have a follow-up presentation if necessary to show you some of the studies we went through on that corner itself.

72
00:05:56,754 --> 00:05:58,255
So before we had the bowed

73
00:05:59,552 --> 00:06:04,513
rounded kind of facade that matches what's across the street over on this side.

74
00:06:04,613 --> 00:06:10,034
And now we gave the units a little bit of outdoor space with the balconies on Park Street.

75
00:06:10,294 --> 00:06:19,096
We thought Park Street is a better street to have a balcony on than the busy Salem Street as it's a little bit quieter and a little bit less trafficked.

76
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:23,137
This is just still the roof terrace.

77
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:24,078
None of that has changed.

78
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:25,738
These are solar panels in the corner.

79
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:29,952
We also went ahead and tried to clarify our materials a little bit.

80
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:32,213
I actually went down to the site.

81
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:40,678
I guess that was a week or two ago to look at that brick that's across the way at the old historical building and right across the street.

82
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,361
And they're kind of using more of a yellowed brick, which I really like.

83
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:55,047
So what we wanted to kind of do is do a textured color brick on that first floor and then kind of more before we were showing some blues and colors to play off the green that's across the way.

84
00:06:55,527 --> 00:07:14,008
And we felt that maybe the building wants to be a little bit more muted, with a cleaner more mature facade with composite gray siding some glass curtain wall on the corner, and then just that gray stone like really try to keep it simple and have the architecture of the building, do the, you know, voice, instead of just having pop of color.

85
00:07:14,448 --> 00:07:19,191
We still want to have this bowed out look to kind of emulate what's across the street.

86
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:26,955
We just think it's such a beautiful detail to have some ornament to the building instead of just flat facades.

87
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:32,278
We also want to bring that ornamentation up above where we would have the covered deck.

88
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:34,579
So essentially these would be somewhat covered.

89
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:37,601
It's only a two foot projection, so it's not huge.

90
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:41,043
It's the same dimension that we have on this facade.

91
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,851
And then we went through and started updating our renderings.

92
00:07:45,312 --> 00:07:52,176
So you could see we kind of got our landscape in there, which I will show the landscape plan again to refresh you guys how lush and green this is.

93
00:07:52,697 --> 00:08:03,924
So before I had a red, we had a red brick down on this main part, and we went more with this, you know, yellow, yellow, like brown brick, which I just think really ties the two streets together.

94
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:08,269
And we are kind of keeping with this band that they have as well, which I really like.

95
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:11,833
And we're starting to look at the idea of this kind of curtain walls.

96
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:18,634
glass storefront corner to bring a little bit of modernity into the street.

97
00:08:18,974 --> 00:08:23,376
On Salem Street itself, if you continue up, there's a couple of modern new buildings that were built.

98
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:32,460
So having a little bit of that language on this corner, we felt is a nice embrace of what's coming down Salem Street and into the future in Medford.

99
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,742
We thought this did a better job kind of holding the corner while giving this space actually back to the tenants.

100
00:08:39,203 --> 00:08:42,444
And then they still get some outdoor space with their balconies on Park Street.

101
00:08:44,414 --> 00:08:53,902
We went ahead and we masked out all the surrounding buildings to kind of show the scale and size of some of these neighborhood buildings, along with our shadow studies.

102
00:08:54,302 --> 00:09:00,688
I took my shadow studies on the equinoxes is spring and fall are obviously on the same, which is March.

103
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:08,486
And really the only time I felt like there is heavy shadows was on the December one, kind of in the morning when the sun is really low.

104
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:11,048
But our building, again, is only three stories.

105
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:13,831
So it fits pretty well with the neighborhood context.

106
00:09:13,871 --> 00:09:18,795
We have this really large school and a couple of large buildings right around it.

107
00:09:19,115 --> 00:09:21,137
So massing wise, we felt it fit well.

108
00:09:21,838 --> 00:09:24,820
It didn't overstand compared to anything else.

109
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,304
And especially with the shadows, even the buildings directly next door in summer,

110
00:09:30,713 --> 00:09:35,635
And March, just the way the sun angle happens, you know, essentially the south side is down here.

111
00:09:35,775 --> 00:09:43,739
So the sun angle doesn't really bring our neighbors into shadow that heavily except, you know, around the lower end of the equinoxes.

112
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,980
So the shadow study was a very useful tool.

113
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,261
I really appreciate that as a help that you guys recommended and even just looking at that.

114
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:04,936
Bye bye.

115
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,353
it's actually on Pilote back there.

116
00:10:23,334 --> 00:10:30,961
So the only part of the building that touches the street is this 2,340 square foot blue corner here.

117
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:39,629
I'll go back to the landscape plan so you can kind of see how well this is a little lawn that we designed and then it's filled with vegetation throughout the site.

118
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:46,095
It does a really nice job kind of hiding the infrastructure of the parking and whatnot from Park Street and Salem Street.

119
00:10:47,362 --> 00:10:52,463
Then we have up here the solar side of about 1000 square feet of solar panels as possible.

120
00:10:53,884 --> 00:11:08,027
And we did this kind of fun study through some of our programs to kind of show the benefit of $22,000 of savings and how many trees we can plant and how 1000 square feet of solar panels on that flat area at the right angle would be super beneficial.

121
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:12,588
The building can actually power the what will be an all electric HVAC system.

122
00:11:15,683 --> 00:11:33,395
I actually just want to highlight as well there, we talked about the dumpster location, and we wanted to show you know what we were planning of these rollout dumpsters, there would be two if you look at the civil plan which I can pull up after this, and the idea is they would roll out and be picked up and delivered and cleaned out from Park Street side.

123
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:35,316
So essentially that would be the flow out.

124
00:11:38,522 --> 00:11:40,405
We also went ahead and updated our renderings.

125
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:51,679
So this was a very helpful tool that that helped us explore that facade a little bit greater and even see this the massing in context with especially what's right next door.

126
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:54,783
These are the large buildings right around the corner.

127
00:11:55,373 --> 00:11:59,274
uh, this, you know, really, really strong roof right next door.

128
00:11:59,874 --> 00:12:05,355
And then you could see what we started putting the vegetation in and it really does a nice job kind of hiding that ground floor.

129
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:09,695
Um, obviously this, these trees would be in bloom in these renderings.

130
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:17,977
Um, this is the new curtain wall study, trying to keep this ribbon that we have in play as the neighboring building has as well.

131
00:12:18,057 --> 00:12:24,618
We felt like there's a really nice tie in and that glass curtain wall really is a prominent focal point on Salem street now.

132
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:29,647
I'm just going to leave this up for a second and we can revisit this as well.

133
00:12:30,747 --> 00:12:33,829
The roof, the proposed roof deck is quite small.

134
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:36,290
It's about 500 square feet and you can't see it.

135
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:38,531
We tucked it back away from the side.

136
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:40,652
So no one's overhanging, no one's shouting.

137
00:12:40,672 --> 00:12:43,014
It won't be obtrusive to the neighbors.

138
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:49,657
You might see the penthouse a little bit on the Park Street side, but when you're up close on the sidewalk, you certainly won't see anything.

139
00:12:55,275 --> 00:13:07,319
And then I just wanted to share just a kind of reminder to everybody, our beautiful site plan and what we really want to do to give back to this lot, which, as you guys know, sits right now.

140
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:16,042
And what was there before with the oil building and how lush and green we want to kind of design this garden, we've been calling it, over on the side.

141
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:19,963
And then bring these, you can see right here, I have four, they have four

142
00:13:20,543 --> 00:13:23,725
really large trees to kind of focal point the corners of the building.

143
00:13:24,045 --> 00:13:27,567
Just to reiterate everyone again, we want commercial space in the first floor.

144
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:32,950
So off Salem Street, we'll have commercial A and commercial B with your entrances right here.

145
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,773
And then to get into the tenant use building, you would come through Park Street right here.

146
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:47,278
So you're kind of always wrapping where there isn't any sort of entryway with green space in and out on Park Street here with our parking as well.

147
00:13:50,675 --> 00:14:05,338
And then, um, the last thing I have, um, is our, is our kind of landscape, excuse me, our civil plan, which I don't, I'm not sure if someone wants to take this over from me and just speak on this a little bit more, if there's something here that's been updated.

148
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:15,602
Hi, Jacob.

149
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:16,384
Thank you for that.

150
00:14:16,845 --> 00:14:17,706
So I'm Pat Bauer.

151
00:14:17,746 --> 00:14:19,290
I did the civil work on this.

152
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:23,839
Nothing new since the last appearance here with the board.

153
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:32,136
We did look at the dumpster as Jake spoke about, and we are working on addressing some of the engineering comments.

154
00:14:33,137 --> 00:14:37,362
They did say they wanted to look at that when we get further along into the process here.

155
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:46,652
So nothing new really to speak of on the civil plans right now, but we would have some revised plans later on in the process, I think.

156
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,349
Thank you very much.

157
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:53,693
And then the last thing I just want to show you guys that we really did our homework on this corner.

158
00:14:54,093 --> 00:15:07,686
And we're taking this that opportunity pretty seriously in terms of what it can be kind of coming up with a few different options, really thinking about what the best use of that space would be from a tenant perspective in a city perspective.

159
00:15:08,066 --> 00:15:35,197
And we really landed on something with the curtain wall versus like a punch window system looked at a round balcony system trying to match the corner And then this is where we kind of started from with just two open balconies there And then we changed up the park street facade as well We kind of looked at doing a combination and we landed on the the x which we felt like is a really elegant solution so after that i'm going to hand it back to Adam and answer any questions you guys might have and open back up our presentation

160
00:15:35,857 --> 00:15:37,718
And thank you very much for all your feedback.

161
00:15:37,898 --> 00:15:38,919
It was extremely helpful.

162
00:15:44,563 --> 00:15:46,524
Yeah, from our end, thank you, Jacob.

163
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:49,426
That's essentially it.

164
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:53,188
I mean, those are the changes that we've made to the project.

165
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:57,671
And yeah, I think that that's the majority of the presentation tonight.

166
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,673
So happy to answer any questions the board has.

167
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:23,677
Well, for one, I want to thank you for seriously taking into consideration the board's comments previously, because I know that you needed to get to a certain plan design before going to the ZBA, but this has been hugely significant, especially explaining how the context of the lot and how it plays into the buildings across from it.

168
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,057
I really appreciate that.

169
00:16:25,397 --> 00:16:28,058
The one thing I want to clarify is the dumpster.

170
00:16:28,138 --> 00:16:31,360
I was a little confused on the dumpster last time, and I'm still trying to figure out

171
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:53,131
Um understanding the the dumpster so if you can go back to that and then i'll i'll pass it off to the rest of the board Just how that dumpster will um So I I get I I can answer this.

172
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:57,614
So basically we were looking at having these rollout These rollout dumpsters.

173
00:16:57,634 --> 00:17:00,736
So what they'll they'll sit where you see it located here.

174
00:17:00,756 --> 00:17:00,796
Um

175
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:05,265
on the right side of the parking area.

176
00:17:05,626 --> 00:17:09,909
So that's where the residents will bring their trash and place it in the dumpster.

177
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:20,217
Then when they, on trash day or whenever they have that scheduled, the truck, whoever's in the truck, one person will get out, roll the dumpster out to the street.

178
00:17:20,557 --> 00:17:26,202
It'll be dumped by the truck and then rolled back into place to be available for the residents.

179
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:33,985
So that's something that whoever's on the trash truck would do it wouldn't be something necessarily that the people managing the building would do.

180
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:38,226
So the trash company would be in charge of the flow of that through the parking area.

181
00:17:39,107 --> 00:17:42,028
If the management company or the owner chose to do it that way.

182
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,520
Thank you.

183
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:55,103
The only other two comments I would have is just to make sure at this point to adhere to the department has comments going forward.

184
00:17:55,384 --> 00:17:59,665
There's not much more I can speak on outside of final plans.

185
00:18:00,225 --> 00:18:13,971
And then if the city had any questions on the architectural design of the balconies, I'm a little curious as to what the city would say before sending this to the ZBA, because as we know,

186
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:20,441
if this is the chance to actually pretty much weigh in on those balconies.

187
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:25,268
I don't see an issue with them at this point, but I'm not sure what the city thinks.

188
00:18:25,429 --> 00:18:26,771
And then I'll open it up to the board.

189
00:18:37,438 --> 00:18:42,443
specifically the architectural features of the balconies.

190
00:18:42,903 --> 00:18:44,845
How does that play into the city's plans?

191
00:18:46,106 --> 00:18:47,867
You mean the balconies and not the corner?

192
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:57,276
The corner, I am a little concerned about too, but it's a lot better than what we've seen previously.

193
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:11,085
Right, and I would actually, I really appreciated seeing that those studies, because when I saw the options really drawn out like that, I went, oh, oh, maybe this is the best of choice.

194
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:21,327
Because it really helped seeing the different, like, what it would look like if it was solid, what it would look like if it was just an open balcony.

195
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:25,028
And you're right, like, when I look at these,

196
00:19:27,472 --> 00:19:39,836
I will say you're going to want to check with whoever your energy consultant is about curtain walls and the energy code and making sure that that's going to be okay, that they're going to be able to design to it.

197
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:44,298
But they look beautiful, I think people will love it.

198
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:53,581
Then the balconies, the only question I have in our building commissioners not on is just checking zoning.

199
00:19:55,702 --> 00:20:01,529
I don't think I think that because they're up above the first floor, they don't impact zoning in any way.

200
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:04,793
I wouldn't want you to introduce any new.

201
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:08,570
I'm zoning variants is that you're going to need to ask for.

202
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,131
And Jackie I'll just say for you because I noticed this.

203
00:20:13,372 --> 00:20:17,293
We, there will be there, the board will open for public comments.

204
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:21,174
And at that time, people can raise their hands and provide comments.

205
00:20:22,315 --> 00:20:24,495
We cannot take public comments in the chat.

206
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:31,878
If for some reason you will be unable to mute yourself, you can always say that in the chat and we can read a comment out for you because of that.

207
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:35,299
But I just don't want people to start putting additional

208
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:36,480
comments in the chat.

209
00:20:37,961 --> 00:20:42,685
Danielle, did you have anything you wanted to add about the balconies since Jackie asked?

210
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:46,608
The balconies on the Park Street side?

211
00:20:46,968 --> 00:20:49,210
Yes.

212
00:20:50,831 --> 00:20:57,477
Because I wasn't at the last meeting, so I wasn't able to listen to or watch the recording.

213
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,481
I mean, I always think that having some

214
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:10,371
The fresh air and availability of kind of like an open space in an apartment building is good.

215
00:21:10,391 --> 00:21:14,533
I do still think it's a little top heavy in the back.

216
00:21:15,994 --> 00:21:25,438
I don't know if the, can the architect explain the structural support in the back?

217
00:21:26,238 --> 00:21:30,440
Is there a reason it can't be kind of like bolstered a little bit?

218
00:21:36,702 --> 00:21:39,123
I'm not, I'm not really following.

219
00:21:39,623 --> 00:21:41,224
This is a good time.

220
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:43,305
I'm not really following that question.

221
00:21:43,365 --> 00:21:47,087
Are you talking kind of like back here where it's sitting on pillow today?

222
00:21:47,227 --> 00:21:48,087
Yeah.

223
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:56,231
So the larger or a little bit more substantial, sturdier looking so that doesn't.

224
00:21:57,769 --> 00:22:01,093
For sure, and I think the, I'm just trying to get to my ground floor plan.

225
00:22:01,414 --> 00:22:08,884
I think the idea would be like, maybe they could be found in decorative, but, you know, we're kind of park under them.

226
00:22:08,924 --> 00:22:10,145
There is another building.

227
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:12,769
I think it's also on Salem street, right off the street.

228
00:22:13,530 --> 00:22:14,751
that did something similar.

229
00:22:14,771 --> 00:22:18,553
There's also one in Somerville on Highland Ave that did something similar as well.

230
00:22:19,414 --> 00:22:24,237
The idea is just it gives you, you're using the massing and you're using the building as protective covering, right?

231
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:35,304
So when you come and park and you're not walking in the rain, so we kind of wanted to have as little columns as possible without them becoming a nuisance for the parking scheme.

232
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:37,165
So at least that was what the general

233
00:22:37,846 --> 00:22:42,708
idea was behind why it's raised up like that back there.

234
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:51,652
Having heard your thought on the massiveness of it, you know, I think that's where that landscape plan really comes into play.

235
00:22:52,192 --> 00:22:57,094
Really does a good job trying to kind of hide some of that building infrastructure again.

236
00:22:57,114 --> 00:23:00,455
It kind of makes the whole thing almost look like it's floating on green space.

237
00:23:02,856 --> 00:23:06,298
But that's the idea at least is where you're using that structure to

238
00:23:07,029 --> 00:23:19,331
get the building up and then park under it safely and give someone, everyone, including bike storage, a clean place to park their bikes and get into the building protected from the elements.

239
00:23:20,991 --> 00:23:25,772
Yeah, through the chair, certainly in favor of podium parking, parking the building.

240
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:36,174
I just didn't know if there was a way to kind of just make it feel more anchored, but sure, you know, it's a

241
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:38,572
design preference.

242
00:23:38,592 --> 00:23:39,613
I'm just one person.

243
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:42,674
So I defer to the board.

244
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:48,115
Thank you.

245
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:54,277
Okay, I'm going to go to the board and I see Emily and then Pam after.

246
00:23:56,693 --> 00:23:56,993
Awesome.

247
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:57,453
Thank you.

248
00:23:57,473 --> 00:24:01,714
Oh, no, you're good.

249
00:24:01,894 --> 00:24:02,174
You're good.

250
00:24:02,194 --> 00:24:02,974
Take the chair.

251
00:24:03,315 --> 00:24:05,295
I'm super impressed.

252
00:24:05,315 --> 00:24:17,378
I really like the modifications that this applicant has made, whether it's switching the blue stripe to a gray stripe, really occupying the corner.

253
00:24:17,398 --> 00:24:25,680
I think that these are some really, really smart moves and always appreciate a reference to Corbusier's five points of architecture.

254
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,500
So well done there.

255
00:24:27,462 --> 00:24:38,047
Um, I, I hear what, uh, Danielle Evans is saying in terms of the back of the building feeling kind of unanchored.

256
00:24:38,688 --> 00:24:53,795
And I wonder, um, if, if there was a way to almost put like, like in facade only like brick in that back corner, um, to, you know, enclose the cars that are back there.

257
00:24:54,302 --> 00:25:01,466
So potentially adding a little bit of privacy, which the residents might prefer their cars to be a little bit covered rather than open.

258
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:03,007
It wouldn't be structural.

259
00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:05,609
It would simply just be aesthetic.

260
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:18,537
Or even like a screen in front of that, just to add a little bit more mental support, I guess, to the building.

261
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,863
But I understand that structurally it's not necessary and you want to have as much open space down there as possible.

262
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:28,246
So, yeah, I mean, I really appreciate it.

263
00:25:28,266 --> 00:25:30,047
I love the balconies, love the corner.

264
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:33,129
Yeah, really well done.

265
00:25:34,754 --> 00:25:36,595
Just want to comment on that.

266
00:25:37,296 --> 00:25:39,057
I think that's a fantastic idea.

267
00:25:39,277 --> 00:25:42,680
Even if it was, it would be great to have that as a green wall on the back.

268
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:49,145
You know, I think where you're kind of referencing is where my head goes is, you know, this back wall back here, which.

269
00:25:49,628 --> 00:25:51,509
You know, we are showing like a fence on the plan.

270
00:25:51,649 --> 00:26:03,052
So there's a fence there, but you know, if you actually had this as like a living wall or, or maybe it is like a masonry tiered wall that has, you know, planters in it, it would be a really cool feature.

271
00:26:03,072 --> 00:26:10,274
Um, we just want to be careful with how dark and dungy and creepy that space underneath gets, you know, Totally, totally.

272
00:26:10,294 --> 00:26:15,016
And I'd say, you know, let your budget influence that for sure.

273
00:26:15,096 --> 00:26:16,436
But I think you guys can,

274
00:26:17,842 --> 00:26:27,930
use some creative solutions to kind of anchor that, the Northwest corner of the building, where the yellow Volkswagen Beetle is.

275
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:28,650
Yep.

276
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:29,731
Thank you very much.

277
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:30,612
That's great feedback.

278
00:26:31,933 --> 00:26:32,113
Yeah.

279
00:26:32,693 --> 00:26:33,294
Thank you, Jackie.

280
00:26:33,314 --> 00:26:35,055
Thank you.

281
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:36,656
And next is Pam Marianski.

282
00:26:37,908 --> 00:26:41,652
Yeah, I just want to echo and appreciation for response to comments.

283
00:26:42,874 --> 00:26:45,617
Yeah, I think my concern is that the glass curtain wall.

284
00:26:46,999 --> 00:26:56,350
And, you know, just again, this is my aesthetic, my concern that it, you know, looks a little more commercial than residential to me, just especially in the context of, you know, just the, the,

285
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,572
of the feeling of the building across the street.

286
00:27:00,053 --> 00:27:04,537
And just for a practical sense, it looks like that's the main living area for those units.

287
00:27:05,377 --> 00:27:08,000
And I just wonder if they'll feel very exposed.

288
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:14,725
And yeah, I wonder what tenants might do with window treatments there.

289
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:18,869
Are you going to be looking in at what are you going to see from the street behind there?

290
00:27:18,909 --> 00:27:21,110
Are you going to see some funky curtains?

291
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:23,392
Are you going to see televisions?

292
00:27:24,707 --> 00:27:27,528
So I mean, again, it's a personal aesthetic preference.

293
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,830
And I understand this need to sort of hold the corner.

294
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:41,313
But yeah, I just have concerns about how that looks and feels in the context of the other buildings.

295
00:27:51,057 --> 00:27:51,637
Thank you, Pam.

296
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:58,162
This is information to take in.

297
00:27:58,663 --> 00:28:12,350
It's given the applicant a little bit of idea of how the board will move to vote in a future meeting, because we know that you still need variances.

298
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:21,355
So if you're not prepared to answer board member Marianski's question now, just keep it in the back of your head that that is a concern that one of the board members has.

299
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:26,009
And then, okay, so we'll go to board member Ari Fishman.

300
00:28:28,412 --> 00:28:29,193
Thank you, Chair.

301
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:40,728
I also want to echo appreciation and that I'm impressed at the amount of work that's gone into this in response to our feedback with great appreciation.

302
00:28:41,772 --> 00:28:43,634
My question is also about the curtain wall.

303
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:51,502
And I'm thinking specifically about the impact of having these large reflective surfaces right at the corner.

304
00:28:51,702 --> 00:29:04,376
And I'm curious if you've done modeling about the effect of both sun and car light beams and how they might affect visibility, especially of cars, but also of potentially into other units.

305
00:29:09,837 --> 00:29:10,278
For sure.

306
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:16,064
I'm going to touch on that curtain wall because I knew it was going to be kind of a hot topic.

307
00:29:16,525 --> 00:29:17,847
And truthfully, if.

308
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:25,565
this idea gets kind of passed by you guys, just this idea that we want to do something special with glass in this corner.

309
00:29:25,585 --> 00:29:37,132
We would bring in a company like Conair or, or, or a shoot go, or even, even, you know, a curtain wall company that would kind of help mediate some of those challenges, right?

310
00:29:37,552 --> 00:29:42,475
Rather it be like a fritted bottom, or maybe it's two feet of solid where the band is.

311
00:29:42,895 --> 00:30:02,428
right and it's only like four feet of actually glass and then your window treatment comes down you know I think the idea I personally am not very um attracted by like what they're building a seaport with all just the glass glass glass and then you see it at night and it's just a complete you know everyone has their curtains down right and then during the day you get too much sun and everyone has their curtains down

312
00:30:03,108 --> 00:30:16,493
So I think that's the same solution here, but we wanted to at least show the idea that this would be a reflective corner that would still show massing, but has the transparency and the illusion of something that's soft and elegant.

313
00:30:16,853 --> 00:30:18,754
So that's kind of the design of this curtain wall.

314
00:30:19,014 --> 00:30:26,697
But without my curtain wall consultant kind of stepping up at this point, you know, I can't give you those exact details on if it's going to be six feet true glass,

315
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:29,039
with spandrel at the top and bottom.

316
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:34,364
Because in reality, you know, you're gonna have a spandrel panel down here and you're gonna have a spandrel panel down here at the slab edge.

317
00:30:34,725 --> 00:30:40,491
So that might come down a little bit and you would have the spandrel panel try to match the reflectance of the glass.

318
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:46,497
We wouldn't want something that's super reflective to echo what you just said and it's just gonna, you know,

319
00:30:47,277 --> 00:30:50,498
Headlights and everything just jumping right off it at the same token.

320
00:30:50,538 --> 00:31:05,922
You don't want something that's super transparent where you can just see through into everybody's living space, but at the same token, you know, it's really if I was a tenant there and having a glass wall and seeing the city and allowing the city to come in, it would be a very attractive thing to have in a very unique situation.

321
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:08,903
And again, if you kind of look at the plants, it's only 2 units.

322
00:31:09,383 --> 00:31:35,743
at the end of the day that really get them and it's these really nice units and you know we're trying to we're going to build the kitchen kind of on the other side and have the dining over there and the living room comes off you still get that little terrace so it'd be a really unique kind of area unit living space itself so certainly thought has been taken into that curtain wall um but the um construction documents on that have not taken place yet but i hear you guys thank you

323
00:31:38,602 --> 00:31:39,883
And we have Vice Chair Hedeman.

324
00:31:40,143 --> 00:31:41,384
You can go right ahead.

325
00:31:43,165 --> 00:31:45,826
Just a quick recommendation for a local precedent.

326
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:55,712
I know you mentioned that the Seaport and their all glass towers, 5 Cabot Road, Medford Mass, 02155, Modera Medford.

327
00:31:55,732 --> 00:31:57,693
It's a department building built in 2014.

328
00:31:58,273 --> 00:32:02,055
It kind of mixes like a townhouse and modern aesthetic.

329
00:32:02,856 --> 00:32:06,558
They have an all glass corner on their third and fourth floor units.

330
00:32:07,477 --> 00:32:33,882
um so that could be a good local precedent for this five cabinet road c-a-b-o-t like the cheese thank you yep i don't see any you can't see peter um i'm here i had no further comment

331
00:32:37,074 --> 00:32:37,455
updates.

332
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,421
Okay, thank you.

333
00:32:39,441 --> 00:32:42,589
So I am going to open up the public comment period.

334
00:32:44,473 --> 00:32:49,014
So those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

335
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:54,196
You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

336
00:32:54,696 --> 00:32:58,217
Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

337
00:32:58,718 --> 00:33:05,220
A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

338
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:12,242
However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.

339
00:33:14,376 --> 00:33:16,938
Depending on the number of comments, we'll go two to three minutes.

340
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:23,301
And Danielle, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

341
00:33:26,003 --> 00:33:33,807
There was a comment in the chat that I'm not sure if that participant is still here.

342
00:33:34,107 --> 00:33:36,228
I think we can stop that person.

343
00:33:37,389 --> 00:33:42,512
Cheryl R., did you want to read out your question before we begin?

344
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,181
Okay, Danielle, I can't see anything else.

345
00:33:53,642 --> 00:33:55,043
Thing that she can't raise your hand.

346
00:33:55,363 --> 00:33:57,724
Um, I will unmute.

347
00:33:59,065 --> 00:34:00,726
Cheryl asked to unmute.

348
00:34:00,746 --> 00:34:03,207
There we go.

349
00:34:03,227 --> 00:34:03,407
Hello.

350
00:34:03,447 --> 00:34:04,648
Can you hear me?

351
00:34:05,348 --> 00:34:06,309
Yes, we can hear you.

352
00:34:07,329 --> 00:34:08,290
I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

353
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,830
I live at 281 Park Street.

354
00:34:11,011 --> 00:34:12,492
So I'm very close to this project.

355
00:34:13,511 --> 00:34:20,462
I was on the community meeting that they had and every neighbor that was on that meeting said that this was not enough parking for this area.

356
00:34:21,332 --> 00:34:23,553
This is a highly restricted area.

357
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:25,633
Park Street has restrictions in parking.

358
00:34:25,673 --> 00:34:27,594
Parris Street has restrictions on parking.

359
00:34:28,074 --> 00:34:34,036
Tainter Street is permit parking, and one spot per unit is unprecedented.

360
00:34:34,096 --> 00:34:39,058
We just lowered our parking minimums to one and a half per unit, and this is one.

361
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,879
They should take the top off of it.

362
00:34:42,319 --> 00:34:47,981
And we lived with the temporary fence for about two years now, and we were very grateful when they took down the,

363
00:34:48,701 --> 00:34:52,503
The tarps that they had covering it because the corner was very dangerous.

364
00:34:53,083 --> 00:34:55,964
You couldn't see coming around the corner.

365
00:34:56,424 --> 00:35:03,967
So I'm concerned that this building is going to replace those tarps and we're not going to be able to see or that jungle that they were showing in their pictures on the corner.

366
00:35:04,615 --> 00:35:10,020
is going to replace and make this a very blind corner coming down from Salem Street turning to park.

367
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:25,893
There's no parking at that corner at all so I'm also concerned about coming around that corner and there being a trash truck just in the middle of the street with a dumpster being pulled out to the curb and traffic's not going to be able to flow.

368
00:35:26,493 --> 00:35:30,617
Barely two cars can fit around that corner so if someone stopped at the light

369
00:35:31,413 --> 00:35:36,559
sometimes you can't make that corner because there's no double yellow there as they had in their paperwork.

370
00:35:37,141 --> 00:35:39,021
There's not a yellow line there.

371
00:35:39,822 --> 00:35:43,582
Also, it's not a social good to add a convenience store there.

372
00:35:44,002 --> 00:35:46,843
There's another convenience store about 50 feet from there.

373
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:50,444
After the house, the next building is a convenience store.

374
00:35:50,824 --> 00:35:53,624
There's also a convenience store at the corner of Salem and Fulton.

375
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:56,925
There's also a convenience store at the corner of Salem and Cherry.

376
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,886
There's also three convenience stores in Haynes Square.

377
00:36:00,386 --> 00:36:02,086
So we really, really don't need

378
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,571
another highly expensive food option that's not a social good for us.

379
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:11,453
This project should be, if they can't add parking, they should reduce units.

380
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:13,453
This is a very dense area.

381
00:36:13,873 --> 00:36:16,874
We have a lot of students in this area that have a lot of cars.

382
00:36:17,394 --> 00:36:24,416
It's a lot of two family homes that have many, many cars and we can't absorb their cars.

383
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:29,818
Are they willing to be deed restricted that if we have to go permit parking so we can park on our own street?

384
00:36:30,338 --> 00:36:37,401
that they won't get any permits because they're saying that they're not gonna need cars, even though this is a very low T accessible area.

385
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:39,181
That's my comment.

386
00:36:40,682 --> 00:36:41,042
Thank you.

387
00:36:41,662 --> 00:36:42,103
Thank you.

388
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:57,088
Madam chair, I don't see any other members of the public with a raised hand.

389
00:36:57,368 --> 00:36:58,809
I also have not received any

390
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:01,828
written comments.

391
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:06,190
I do want to respond to Ms.

392
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,011
Rodriguez's comments.

393
00:37:09,732 --> 00:37:19,237
We can add a condition that would prohibit residents of this building from being able to attain city parking permits.

394
00:37:19,837 --> 00:37:29,082
So if there was on-street permit parking, they would not be eligible to receive one if they came into the

395
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:33,414
parking department their address would be on a list saying that they're not eligible for that.

396
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:44,790
And that would ensure that folks who are moving into this, indeed, don't have multiple cars that if there's only one spot per unit that

397
00:37:46,582 --> 00:37:55,445
If someone has more than one car, they would have to figure out an option of renting an off street spot somewhere else because on street wouldn't be an option.

398
00:37:56,005 --> 00:38:01,207
And this was a condition that was added by city council for 100 Winchester.

399
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:14,231
So, and this is something that is regularly added as a condition in Somerville that seems to work well when the property owner makes it clear before selling or

400
00:38:16,886 --> 00:38:25,392
signing leases with residents that they will not have the ability to park on street.

401
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:31,737
So that could be something to consider.

402
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,761
Thank you, Danielle.

403
00:38:40,823 --> 00:38:46,047
And you don't have any other comments to read, to share, and there was no hands.

404
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:52,787
Okay, so I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting.

405
00:38:56,449 --> 00:39:10,218
And to bring it back to the board, and so we're not voting on 290 Salem Street this evening, because as I mentioned earlier, they still need variances, but we want to give them an idea of what's acceptable.

406
00:39:12,678 --> 00:39:25,804
and to give them some feedback if there's gonna be additional changes before they go off to the ZBA for me and before they wind up coming back before us if those variances are approved.

407
00:39:26,784 --> 00:39:35,728
I have no further comments other than just making sure that you're being in tune with the department head comments.

408
00:39:36,389 --> 00:39:38,549
And I have no comments until that's handled.

409
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:41,771
I don't know if the board has any other comments that they wanna share.

410
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:45,996
for this evening for 290 Salem.

411
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:54,501
Hearing none, I am going to ask for a motion.

412
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:55,741
Chair, sorry.

413
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:58,623
Yes, sorry.

414
00:40:00,055 --> 00:40:00,715
No worries.

415
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:02,396
Thank you, Chair.

416
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:10,359
I wanted to say that I did very much like Danielle's idea about the deed restriction on parking.

417
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:13,700
I think that could work well in this situation.

418
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:22,943
And that would be, do we know that should the applicant come back before us for once we can vote, actually.

419
00:40:24,824 --> 00:40:28,365
But because we're not voting this evening, I didn't reiterate.

420
00:40:31,324 --> 00:40:39,549
So with that, we will vote to continue the meeting to a date certain after their ZBA meeting.

421
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:46,552
Madam Chair, I see that the applicant's attorney, Adam Barnowski, has his hand raised.

422
00:40:47,092 --> 00:40:47,733
Oh, okay.

423
00:40:50,624 --> 00:40:51,945
And thank you, I appreciate it.

424
00:40:52,205 --> 00:41:13,711
So the one thing I do want to just before you close the meeting or vote on this, I know that the procedures here is relatively new where we're going before this board and then the ZBA and then we come back before this board because this board can't vote on the site plan until the variances are granted.

425
00:41:14,591 --> 00:41:16,072
But I do want to make sure there's not,

426
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:29,556
I guess it's I want to make sure that we are addressing all of the board's concerns and that just respectfully that there's not too much of a ping-ponging between this board and the ZBA.

427
00:41:29,576 --> 00:41:40,641
If the ZBA wants to make sure your concerns are met before they vote on it, and you can't make the votes until the ZBA votes on it, that just due to the time and expense of all of these hearings on the applicant to have

428
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:48,125
there, you know, various professionals come and attend and we want to make sure that whatever we're doing is going to be acceptable to you as a board.

429
00:41:48,225 --> 00:41:59,471
So, I have heard a lot of comments, we've written down, you know, all of the comments, same as last time, but there do seem to be some differing opinions that seem to be more aesthetic based and

430
00:42:01,172 --> 00:42:13,899
If we could get any more direction to ensure that whatever we're bringing before you is going to be acceptable, I think that would be really helpful because I know that there's several members of the board and each person has maybe a different opinion on the same thing.

431
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:23,425
I don't know if you want to have any clear-cut instructions that we can go back to so that we can tell the CBA, this is exactly what we're looking for.

432
00:42:23,465 --> 00:42:29,148
They're only aesthetic changes, therefore, there is no possible change to the zoning relief that we're seeking.

433
00:42:30,333 --> 00:42:30,953
Does that make sense?

434
00:42:31,934 --> 00:42:36,037
It makes a lot of sense and I appreciate you asking for clarification on that.

435
00:42:36,077 --> 00:42:49,888
So basically where I was going with it is based on the comments that the board has made tonight, I would have the applicant make definitely make sure that they're keeping the design wall in mind and then knowing that there's going to be a condition for parking coming down.

436
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,289
if this board was to move.

437
00:42:52,309 --> 00:43:00,852
But other than outside of that, I think the actual stance right now is that this is an acceptable plan going forward.

438
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:05,894
I mean, I can't vote by myself and I can't vote without ZBA's approval.

439
00:43:06,014 --> 00:43:14,917
However, I think we pretty much gave you the idea of how we would vote going forward, just with the feedback that we gave tonight.

440
00:43:16,658 --> 00:43:16,778
Okay.

441
00:43:17,659 --> 00:43:18,019
Well, thank you.

442
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:18,639
I appreciate it.

443
00:43:19,762 --> 00:43:36,753
And that's and I don't know if another board member want to add anything if I'm if I'm speaking out of turn Madam chair maintain on the fly since the do you think that the um

444
00:43:38,445 --> 00:44:06,184
some because of this ping ponging um and sorry i'm spring kind of springing this on you the idea of would the board vote to send a letter to the zba saying you know these are the conditions we're going to be looking for or um you know we're we're not requesting any more structural changes to the bill i'm not sure what that would be but um or we don't we're not requesting any changes that would impact

445
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:25,824
the zoning variances, because that is literally what the ZBA, I was at the ZBA meeting, and they basically were saying, what if the planning board asks for a change that makes them move a wall, right, or makes them change the amount of parking they have or something that impacts the actual zoning of it.

446
00:44:27,939 --> 00:44:40,242
So like an advisory letter, we recommend that you, I don't even know if you would, if you were approving site plan, you would approve a site plan and recommend approval to that board.

447
00:44:44,023 --> 00:44:48,764
And that's what they're kind of like going, oh, but we're not going to have a recommendation from the CD board.

448
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:52,325
I don't know if other members would have a thought on that.

449
00:44:53,092 --> 00:45:14,046
What I can tell you, and I'm not sure if this is even legal or permissible, but at this time, I would ask for a motion of approval with a couple of conditions that doesn't necessarily significantly change the architectural structure at all, and definitely not the parking.

450
00:45:15,227 --> 00:45:21,931
And I'm trying to give as much headway as possible without voting and without speaking for the entire board.

451
00:45:26,028 --> 00:45:28,549
So if we're allowed to, yes.

452
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:40,736
Perhaps, I don't know if this was brought up at the previous hearing, but maybe if Attorney Bernaske could outline what are the variances that are specifically being requested.

453
00:45:40,756 --> 00:45:55,124
I believe it's setbacks and some other technical stuff that we have certain things in our ordinance that are basically impossible to meet, like usable open space, which I'm assuming this is probably

454
00:45:56,042 --> 00:45:56,823
one of the variances.

455
00:45:58,283 --> 00:46:11,272
But since this goes to a different board and handled by a different staffer, I'm not 100% up to speed on which variances are being requested to be able to rattle them off.

456
00:46:13,255 --> 00:46:42,190
Yeah, I mean, I'm just gonna pull up those, those variances, but one other thought is instead of taking a vote, I mean, I think that if there was maybe some court, I mean, again, I defer to whatever your process and procedures are, but I do recognize that this is a new one for the city, but I'm not sure if there would be any sort of correspondence between the two departments to the, from the community development board to the zoning board, kind of giving any sort of a, just like a quick summary as to what the comments were

457
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:49,631
of this board so that the zoning board has an idea as to what's going on here tonight.

458
00:46:49,791 --> 00:47:00,474
Because I do think that trying to split the votes, I think that yeah, we probably be getting into a murky legal territory if you're trying to figure out what you're voting on tonight versus what you're voting on once the variances are approved.

459
00:47:01,414 --> 00:47:06,975
But I would think that having some sort of core, I think that the chair seemed very eager to vote on it, but then he

460
00:47:07,015 --> 00:47:18,019
he was just concerned that we'd be creating more process if this board, this community development board made a change that would then require us as the applicant to go back before them on a modification.

461
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:24,762
So he was really trying to do the applicant a service in requesting it like that.

462
00:47:24,962 --> 00:47:35,086
But again, I'm just trying to make sure that we avoid a situation where we can't really get anywhere until one department shows their hand or whatever you want to call it.

463
00:47:37,737 --> 00:47:44,782
And I definitely understand because they're not able to grant a variance that would be detrimental to anything that we've actually changed.

464
00:47:44,942 --> 00:47:46,022
And I get that.

465
00:47:47,123 --> 00:47:54,688
I just, at this point, Director Hunt, my hands are tied as far as how we can help the client going forward.

466
00:47:55,669 --> 00:47:57,070
Legally, I don't know what can be done.

467
00:47:57,872 --> 00:48:00,493
So we could, from our office, write a staff memo.

468
00:48:02,173 --> 00:48:22,160
I would say with the, you know, approval of the board, sort of advising them on what are the, and I actually, I think it would be helpful to read out what are the conditions that we have so far, and you could provide, this is a, you know, these are the things that we saw, this is what we heard, this was what the board was thinking, these are the,

469
00:48:23,913 --> 00:48:35,177
conditions that they expect to be that they expect to be including and pending your approval of their variances.

470
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:43,801
And while it feels like double work, I think that that would actually be like 80% of the decision anyhow.

471
00:48:44,641 --> 00:48:49,763
So that staff memo could then be repurposed into the decision after it was voted on.

472
00:48:50,023 --> 00:48:56,229
we would just be doing it before the meeting, which I believe is next Thursday, the 28th.

473
00:48:58,451 --> 00:48:59,172
Sorry, Danielle.

474
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:11,344
Yeah, so Madam Chair, through the chair, I need to, we had basically the zoning board should have all of the department head comments,

475
00:49:13,756 --> 00:49:16,258
I don't know if they got the compiled list.

476
00:49:16,298 --> 00:49:21,221
Basically, I take from those and I put it into a list of conditions.

477
00:49:22,762 --> 00:49:34,369
Some of these might be addressed, so I don't want to read out all of the engineering division comments, which are below the ground and not something that would affect the site plan.

478
00:49:36,730 --> 00:49:39,632
But there were some things like,

479
00:49:44,257 --> 00:49:44,317
Um.

480
00:49:44,337 --> 00:49:46,678
Making some changes with the traffic signal.

481
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:47,379
Um.

482
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:55,823
When the city engineer had some comments about revising the plan, so some of these might already been been taken care of.

483
00:49:56,363 --> 00:49:58,765
So I need to, um, make sure I have the.

484
00:49:59,565 --> 00:50:02,627
Updated latest plans for everything.

485
00:50:02,647 --> 00:50:05,688
And, um, these came in too late.

486
00:50:05,708 --> 00:50:05,728
I

487
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:20,571
When we send a memo to the zoning board, I wanna make sure that it has the most updated relevant conditions.

488
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:27,332
And some of that would be like replacing the sidewalk along the entire lane.

489
00:50:31,593 --> 00:50:41,796
And one issue with Park Street is a really bad problem with people parking on the sidewalks when they pick up and drop off

490
00:50:42,723 --> 00:50:44,643
um, kids at the school.

491
00:50:45,043 --> 00:51:00,186
I know this because I'm a parent of a child at that school, and I see it all the time, so I don't know if there's some kind of treatment that could be, you know, put on the sidewalk to prevent folks from jumping the curb, because I guarantee people will be parking on the sidewalk in front of your building.

492
00:51:00,206 --> 00:51:03,027
I don't know how to get this enforced.

493
00:51:05,667 --> 00:51:07,748
I see Peter has raised his hand, Madam Chair.

494
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:29,082
Uh, yes, I was just trying to kind of move things along cause we seem to have gotten as far as we're going to get and just trying to figure out what other, I mean, in addition to the department had comments, would we send in this kind of advisory memo to the ZBA?

495
00:51:29,222 --> 00:51:35,027
Would it just be the further study of the curtain wall of the glass curtain wall and the, uh,

496
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:40,086
the deed restriction on the parking?

497
00:51:40,106 --> 00:51:42,867
Is that what we had agreed on?

498
00:51:42,967 --> 00:51:48,090
Just doing my job and trying to figure out what we need.

499
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:51,291
Yes, those are the only two conditions that I have from the board.

500
00:51:51,351 --> 00:52:00,176
And then anything that needs to be addressed from the department heads, which at this point, I'm not able to decipher myself.

501
00:52:03,264 --> 00:52:25,159
through the chair, I think if there's any conditions that you would want to impose that would change the setbacks that are being presented, that those are the kind of substantive things that they would need to know because they're going to be granting variances that would vary the dimensional requirements for this property.

502
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:30,463
And once those dimensional requirements are varied, then you can approve the site plan.

503
00:52:31,304 --> 00:52:31,564
So if

504
00:52:32,465 --> 00:52:43,633
they're granting variances that don't align with a site plan that you want to approve, then that's the kind of big things.

505
00:52:43,673 --> 00:52:51,138
I don't think a glass curtain wall issue isn't going to change the setback.

506
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,080
If you wanted them to move

507
00:52:54,893 --> 00:53:00,457
the corner in that changes setback requirements or the ask.

508
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:03,879
So I think those are the big things.

509
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:12,766
The footprint, anything that would change the footprint would start to create issues with what you can approve.

510
00:53:13,946 --> 00:53:21,692
Oh yeah, and I was very much aware of that, but I'm not sure that we're asking to change setbacks on that corner.

511
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:23,901
I don't think any board member had an issue with that.

512
00:53:23,921 --> 00:53:28,362
At this at this point, especially with their being limited open space, and then there's retail on.

513
00:53:28,942 --> 00:53:31,302
I don't think any board member had an issue with that.

514
00:53:38,944 --> 00:53:41,124
I'm sure I see Emily has raised her hand.

515
00:53:54,237 --> 00:53:55,057
or to the parking.

516
00:53:56,498 --> 00:54:12,828
The only thing that we could potentially change is that Northwest corner, but it seems like that's more aesthetic and decorative rather than related to the massing of the building.

517
00:54:13,888 --> 00:54:21,313
Even if it's like a half height wall, like I think that works and I don't think that would qualify as a substantial change.

518
00:54:23,098 --> 00:54:24,579
And I see Peter has his hand raised.

519
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:28,221
Yeah, just trying to echo that as well.

520
00:54:28,241 --> 00:54:36,685
I don't think, based on everything I've heard so far, that we are proposing anything that will impact the dimensional variances.

521
00:54:38,486 --> 00:54:48,512
So as far as I can tell as a member of this board, we're not going to have anything that impacts the ability to get the variances from CBA.

522
00:54:53,562 --> 00:55:11,952
Yeah, and again, just to echo that and to re-clarify again that if another board was to grant the variances with the architectural features that we've seen before us, we understand that it would be detrimental if we change anything later.

523
00:55:11,972 --> 00:55:18,175
I don't see this board changing anything that would be detrimental to those variances.

524
00:55:24,375 --> 00:55:30,940
Through the chair, do we need a motion to vote on sending that memo?

525
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:36,224
I think that we have arrived at a consensus on the content and the mechanism.

526
00:55:36,384 --> 00:55:40,467
So if there is a need for a motion, I'm happy to move to do so.

527
00:55:41,808 --> 00:55:48,754
Yeah, just to be safe, I'm going to ask for a motion to send a memo to the ZBA through the PDF staff.

528
00:55:50,342 --> 00:55:59,489
on behalf of 290 Salem Street, letting them know what conditions we would approve the site plan and special permit with?

529
00:56:03,252 --> 00:56:03,832
I so move.

530
00:56:05,213 --> 00:56:05,834
And a second?

531
00:56:06,174 --> 00:56:06,594
Second.

532
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:10,577
Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

533
00:56:11,678 --> 00:56:11,798
Aye.

534
00:56:12,759 --> 00:56:13,439
Peter Cowles?

535
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:14,580
Aye.

536
00:56:15,421 --> 00:56:16,101
Ari Fishman?

537
00:56:16,982 --> 00:56:17,122
Aye.

538
00:56:17,723 --> 00:56:18,703
Pam Mariansky?

539
00:56:19,304 --> 00:56:19,364
Aye.

540
00:56:20,356 --> 00:56:28,043
and myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an I. And now I believe we need a motion to continue 290 Salem Street.

541
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:32,166
Does it have to be a date certain, Danielle, or just to the next meeting?

542
00:56:33,748 --> 00:56:41,575
Date certain, which would be, when is the next, April 3rd?

543
00:56:44,617 --> 00:56:45,158
Yes, April 3rd.

544
00:56:47,009 --> 00:56:53,692
Okay, a motion to move 290 Salem Street to the next meeting on April 3rd, 2024.

545
00:56:54,713 --> 00:56:57,694
So moved.

546
00:56:58,975 --> 00:56:59,495
Second.

547
00:57:02,036 --> 00:57:03,237
Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

548
00:57:04,097 --> 00:57:04,217
Aye.

549
00:57:05,118 --> 00:57:05,798
Peter Cowles?

550
00:57:06,779 --> 00:57:06,899
Aye.

551
00:57:07,779 --> 00:57:08,459
Ari Fishman?

552
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:09,380
Aye.

553
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,071
Pam Arianski.

554
00:57:11,691 --> 00:57:11,791
Aye.

555
00:57:12,612 --> 00:57:14,513
And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.

556
00:57:14,954 --> 00:57:20,498
And I'm not sure if I said the language properly, it's to continue, not move, but it's the same, I hope.

557
00:57:21,879 --> 00:57:22,819
Thank you, everyone.

558
00:57:22,859 --> 00:57:23,620
Thank you, attorney.

559
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,302
Thank you all, I appreciate it.

560
00:57:26,502 --> 00:57:26,942
Thank you.

561
00:57:29,164 --> 00:57:29,944
Have a great night.

562
00:57:34,268 --> 00:57:37,310
The next item, I believe, let's see.

563
00:57:40,357 --> 00:57:47,541
The next item is 4864 Commercial Street, which is a site plan review to construct a two-story, 97,857 square foot research and testing laboratory.

564
00:57:53,776 --> 00:57:55,637
I'm going to read the public hearing notice.

565
00:57:55,958 --> 00:58:11,189
The Metro Community Development Board shall conduct a meeting on March 20, 2024, after 6.30 p.m., via Zoom, remote video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review for a new non-residential structure of more than 10,000 square feet, which is a major project.

566
00:58:11,769 --> 00:58:16,293
It was submitted by Empire Management Corporation of 171 Great Road, Akinas.

567
00:58:17,373 --> 00:58:39,553
The applicant is seeking to demolish the existing structures, a construction staging yard, 48 Commercial Street, and a vacant industrial building, 64 Commercial Street, and construct a two-story, 97,857-square-foot research and testing laboratory, which is in allowed use in an industrial zoning district at 48 to 64 Commercial Street, Medford Mass 02155.

568
00:58:43,893 --> 00:58:46,896
Our board is the site plan review authority per section 11-7.

569
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:54,623
PDS staff, can you make any introductory comments, please?

570
00:59:01,048 --> 00:59:01,248
Yes.

571
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,661
This is a, the use is by right.

572
00:59:08,661 --> 00:59:14,723
However, it's subject to site plan review and your board is the site plan review authority.

573
00:59:15,623 --> 00:59:20,264
They have been to the zoning board and received variances for height.

574
00:59:20,284 --> 00:59:28,807
Cause we have a provision in the ordinance that has a maximum height and maximum stories of two.

575
00:59:28,847 --> 00:59:32,888
So while it is two stories, the requirements for this use require

576
00:59:34,382 --> 00:59:36,464
taller floor to ceiling plates.

577
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:41,567
So they got the variance for that.

578
00:59:41,627 --> 00:59:49,133
So now it is, can now go before this board for site plan review.

579
00:59:49,813 --> 00:59:58,960
There were some comments from the city engineer in traffic and parking, our transportation traffic and transportation director.

580
00:59:59,602 --> 01:00:02,864
and I believe there were some requested revisions.

581
01:00:02,924 --> 01:00:14,031
I've seen responses to those comments, but I have not seen revised plans, but we can turn it over to the applicant team to update us on that.

582
01:00:15,893 --> 01:00:22,818
So to make sure here, the board would definitely need to see final plans to vote going forward.

583
01:00:22,858 --> 01:00:30,643
We can open up the public hearing this evening to hear the applicant, but we would be voting on final plans since there's some back and forth with the city, correct?

584
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:40,870
Ideally, there's a revised set of plans that can be voted on as the control set.

585
01:00:43,942 --> 01:00:56,509
I'm not sure what exactly has changed the response to the engineering comments on our traffic comes came in today, I believe, and been flat out in meetings all day that I haven't been able to cross reference them.

586
01:00:57,210 --> 01:01:06,495
And I think that's what we need to be clear of, because when it's conditioned to the point of change, then that means we should have a final set that we're voting on.

587
01:01:11,447 --> 01:01:13,754
OK, we'll hear it going forward.

588
01:01:13,994 --> 01:01:18,748
I believe the tiny dash, you could go ahead.

589
01:01:20,215 --> 01:01:20,755
Thank you, Chair.

590
01:01:21,175 --> 01:01:22,035
Nice to see you all again.

591
01:01:22,055 --> 01:01:28,537
Attorney Adam Dash, 48 Grove Street in Somerville, and I'm here representing the applicant and owner, Empire Management Corporation.

592
01:01:29,097 --> 01:01:41,680
With us is Bernard Gibbons of ABG Realty as the broker and representative for Empire Management, Edwin Hargrave of Tria Design, the project architect, James Almonte and Michael Scott from Land Design Collaborative.

593
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:49,642
They're the civil engineers and landscape architects, and I believe James Almonte will be driving the slides if someone could give him the co-hosting ability to do so.

594
01:01:51,103 --> 01:02:05,374
And we have with us as well, Mary Lou Armstrong from Beta Group, who's our LSP on the environmental side, and Patrick Bradley of Chapel Engineering Associates, who's the traffic engineer on the project.

595
01:02:05,934 --> 01:02:10,898
So just so you know, 48 and 64 Commercial Street, if you could, James, bring up the slides.

596
01:02:11,158 --> 01:02:12,819
Yeah, I just need permission.

597
01:02:14,095 --> 01:02:19,380
And before you continue, Attorney Dash, I'm not sure about everyone else, but I'm having a hard time hearing you.

598
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:22,322
And I thought it was my audio, but then someone else just spoke.

599
01:02:23,123 --> 01:02:24,223
All right.

600
01:02:24,284 --> 01:02:26,806
Well, I'll speak louder than I suppose.

601
01:02:30,228 --> 01:02:31,990
It's not usually a complaint that I hear.

602
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:35,513
All right.

603
01:02:35,553 --> 01:02:39,136
So the Felsway Innovation Center is what we're calling this project here.

604
01:02:39,536 --> 01:02:41,518
And we'll go into some detail so you can see it.

605
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:43,059
If we get the next slide, please.

606
01:02:46,191 --> 01:02:48,233
That's the team that I was just describing to you.

607
01:02:49,253 --> 01:02:51,435
We have everybody here tonight to answer questions.

608
01:02:51,455 --> 01:03:00,241
The site location, you can see on there, it's currently two adjoining properties which total about 193,437 square feet.

609
01:03:00,781 --> 01:03:08,907
The most recent use of the properties have been as a construction staging yard at 48, and a vacant industrial building at number 64.

610
01:03:09,547 --> 01:03:11,869
The property is surrounded by other commercial uses.

611
01:03:12,149 --> 01:03:13,270
Can we go to the next slide?

612
01:03:15,610 --> 01:03:16,371
There's a photo set here.

613
01:03:16,731 --> 01:03:22,078
So you can see the sort of sideways commercial street goes vertically sort of towards the left there.

614
01:03:22,138 --> 01:03:22,318
Yep.

615
01:03:23,219 --> 01:03:28,906
And the BLC 6048 is the vacant industrial staging yard there.

616
01:03:29,466 --> 01:03:31,529
Sorry, the industrial staging yard, not so vacant.

617
01:03:31,609 --> 01:03:35,553
And then below that is the other part, which is 64, where there's a building that is vacant.

618
01:03:36,254 --> 01:03:42,624
You'll also see that there are some wetlands on the bottom of the screen and up that sort of swing around a bit to the left.

619
01:03:43,184 --> 01:03:48,993
To the right behind the property is the shopping center, which has the stop and shop right there.

620
01:03:49,053 --> 01:03:50,776
You can see that on the right, the big building.

621
01:03:51,697 --> 01:04:10,214
So the applicant is seeking to repurpose this underutilized lot by demolishing the existing building and erecting a new two-story building with parking and other associated improvements uses a 97,857 approximate square foot research and testing laboratory building for tough tech.

622
01:04:10,935 --> 01:04:14,837
with a 50,716 square foot footprint.

623
01:04:15,858 --> 01:04:35,050
As Danielle said, this matter went before the Zoning Board of Appeals on February 29th, which approved the variance for building height of 16 1⁄2 feet, because in the industrial district, only 30 foot in height is allowed, but that does not allow the floor-to-ceiling heights that are required for this use, which is allowed by right in the zone, so there was a bit of an inconsistency.

624
01:04:36,551 --> 01:04:37,972
So we go to the next photos, please.

625
01:04:39,431 --> 01:04:41,272
There, so you can see the lovely lot that's there.

626
01:04:41,292 --> 01:04:44,575
It is not the world's nicest place.

627
01:04:44,635 --> 01:04:48,117
And you can see the red arrow is showing you what you're looking at.

628
01:04:48,137 --> 01:04:48,698
So this is all 48.

629
01:04:48,938 --> 01:04:50,999
That's the construction staging yard.

630
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:56,964
And you can see, looking all around it, not the cleanest of uses.

631
01:04:58,324 --> 01:04:59,345
You can keep just going through.

632
01:04:59,365 --> 01:05:02,027
There are a lot of pictures, just to give you the gist of it, because it's a little hard.

633
01:05:02,047 --> 01:05:05,149
If you were driving around, you can't really get in to see all these sides.

634
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:08,712
There's the building that's coming down, not a particularly attractive one.

635
01:05:18,803 --> 01:05:27,248
Right, so we're here before you tonight for site plan review to construct a new building that's non-residential of more than 10,000 square feet in the industrial zone.

636
01:05:27,948 --> 01:05:29,969
As you can see, the lot is oddly shaped.

637
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:35,252
It has that big dent in the top, and then sort of a slant to the right, and the wetlands over to the right as well.

638
01:05:35,893 --> 01:05:37,414
It has also got contamination.

639
01:05:37,474 --> 01:05:44,838
There is an activity and use limitation over on the 48 side, which is shown on the plan, which will involve soil management.

640
01:05:44,898 --> 01:05:47,179
And Mary Lou Armstrong can talk about that later.

641
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:54,782
So this is another reason why we're doing the building as we're doing it and trying not to impact the soil too much.

642
01:05:56,303 --> 01:06:03,146
So Mary Lou, I think this is a good point probably for Mary Lou Armstrong and Beta Group to discuss the AUL and the situation on the lot.

643
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:03,466
Mary Lou?

644
01:06:03,995 --> 01:06:05,236
Okay, hi, everyone.

645
01:06:05,756 --> 01:06:10,741
Yes, I know that town engineer had had the city engineer had had a question about this as well.

646
01:06:10,781 --> 01:06:22,750
So, an activity and use limitation has been implemented on the 48 commercial street portion of the site as Adam said, and that's due to some residual contaminants that are in the urban soil materials.

647
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:25,393
There's some petroleum and some lead based contamination.

648
01:06:26,188 --> 01:06:36,036
And the AUL requires that the subsurface soils are capped with the existing pavement or building footprint to maintain a condition of no significant risk.

649
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:42,554
So prior to any future construction or redevelopment activities, we'll be preparing multiple documents.

650
01:06:42,735 --> 01:06:48,699
One is a soil management plan, which will discuss how the soils are going to be managed on site during construction.

651
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:58,066
Also a health and safety plan, which will describe protocols to ensure safe working conditions during construction for all the workers at the site.

652
01:06:58,707 --> 01:07:03,251
And we'll also prepare a release abatement measure plan that would actually be submitted to MassDEP.

653
01:07:03,731 --> 01:07:06,333
And that would describe how the soils are going to be managed

654
01:07:06,888 --> 01:07:15,994
during construction, whether they'll be reused on site or if there's excess soils that can't be reused on site, they'd be transported off site to a licensed disposal facility.

655
01:07:16,554 --> 01:07:22,458
And the RAM plan that would be submitted to DEP would incorporate the soil management plan and the health and safety plan.

656
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:29,842
And then during construction, we would have LSP oversight during any disturbance of the subsurface soils.

657
01:07:31,613 --> 01:07:36,958
And again, the soils would be either reused on site under the capping system or they'd be disposed of off site.

658
01:07:37,759 --> 01:07:49,450
And when it's all done, we would submit what's called a release abatement measure completion report to DEP documenting that and that the site had been restored to the AUL conditions at the property.

659
01:07:51,258 --> 01:07:51,878
Thank you, Mary Lou.

660
01:07:51,898 --> 01:08:02,005
And this sort of dictates, as you'll see, the location of the building on the site and why we have surface parking on the site as opposed to parking underground, because we do not want to disturb the soil excessively.

661
01:08:02,065 --> 01:08:03,366
We do want to cap where we can.

662
01:08:04,407 --> 01:08:10,971
James Almonte from Land Design Collaborative, the Project Civil Engineers Landscape Architects, will discuss the site landscape plans.

663
01:08:11,392 --> 01:08:11,612
James?

664
01:08:12,607 --> 01:08:13,087
Thanks, Adam.

665
01:08:14,187 --> 01:08:16,348
So this is the proposal for the site.

666
01:08:17,108 --> 01:08:20,869
Just for orientation, Commercial Street is running along the bottom of the screen.

667
01:08:22,089 --> 01:08:23,989
So North is facing left here.

668
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:31,331
So the site has been designed, site and building have been designed to respond to the existing conditions of the site.

669
01:08:32,911 --> 01:08:39,793
The building shown here, these basically two overlapping squares that can be fit out for either one tenant or two.

670
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:55,005
Access to the site is located in two locations, one centrally located here, more for vehicular traffic, and then to the north we have separate access for truck traffic.

671
01:08:56,552 --> 01:09:01,876
Right now, if you're familiar with commercial street in this site, it's basically just a wide open curb cut.

672
01:09:02,616 --> 01:09:06,479
The pavement from commercial street just extends into the site.

673
01:09:06,579 --> 01:09:22,651
So this allows us to close off that curb cut, provide a nice tree lined, curved sidewalk streetscape along commercial street, which will have a pedestrian connection along the north property line to the shopping center.

674
01:09:24,832 --> 01:09:27,193
to the north and to the east.

675
01:09:28,693 --> 01:09:37,415
We'll also have a pedestrian connection with a crosswalk to tie into the existing sidewalk on the west side of Commercial Street.

676
01:09:38,275 --> 01:09:47,598
We can't continue it along the east side of Commercial Street due to the wetland that pretty much runs right up to the limit of pavement on Commercial Street.

677
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:51,839
But the wetland does provide a nice natural screening to the parking lot.

678
01:09:53,475 --> 01:09:57,797
So, you won't be able to really see that as you're traveling down commercial street.

679
01:09:58,638 --> 01:10:13,044
And then another amenity to the site that we're adding is this outdoor gathering area, which will be landscaped and provide seating for people to enjoy their lunch or coffee on a nice day.

680
01:10:14,093 --> 01:10:16,874
So that's that's the proposed site plan Lisa rendering of it.

681
01:10:17,534 --> 01:10:23,096
And then I'll get into a little bit more of the technical plans that were submitted as part of this application.

682
01:10:23,916 --> 01:10:29,017
So, this 1st plan is the layout materials plan chose the parking for about 214 spaces.

683
01:10:31,738 --> 01:10:35,961
which includes 8 electric vehicle charging stations.

684
01:10:36,762 --> 01:10:40,164
We have handicap accessible parking located adjacent to the building.

685
01:10:40,925 --> 01:10:46,329
And we have about 53 compact spaces, which is about 25% of the total.

686
01:10:47,270 --> 01:10:51,613
Under the zoning ordinance, we're allowed up to 30%, so we're under that.

687
01:10:53,034 --> 01:11:01,020
And we also have spaces for about 22 or so bicycles located adjacent to the building.

688
01:11:02,541 --> 01:11:09,347
The loading and trash removal will be located behind the building and will be screened by the building from commercial streets.

689
01:11:09,367 --> 01:11:10,528
It really won't see that.

690
01:11:11,288 --> 01:11:18,975
And then along the northern property line and the easterly property line will be screened by some vegetation proposed landscaping.

691
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:26,408
We're showing snow storage within some of the landscape islands, just trying to keep that in mind.

692
01:11:27,129 --> 01:11:28,732
We have provisions taking care of that.

693
01:11:28,772 --> 01:11:32,217
No, that's located within the 100-foot buffer zone of the wetland.

694
01:11:33,665 --> 01:11:40,850
So, currently, under existing conditions, about 100% of the site is impervious surface, either covered by the building or pavement.

695
01:11:41,770 --> 01:11:51,437
And under proposed conditions, we'll have about 18% of the site will be either landscaped, vegetated, or naturally vegetated open space.

696
01:11:54,567 --> 01:11:56,608
So the next plan is the grading plan.

697
01:11:56,628 --> 01:11:58,829
I won't get into too much detail here.

698
01:11:59,529 --> 01:12:09,933
But basically what we had to do is we're sloping up into the site and we had to do that basically to meet the groundwater offsets for the stormwater design.

699
01:12:11,053 --> 01:12:18,536
So we'll be sloping up into the site and then we'll have a series of low points to capture the stormwater throughout the parking lot.

700
01:12:19,776 --> 01:12:23,778
And we can get into more detail on stormwater design as necessary.

701
01:12:25,647 --> 01:12:28,449
It's a grading plan, and then this is the drainage and utility plan.

702
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:34,372
And stormwater has been designed to meet the state and local standards.

703
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:42,958
These large rectangles you see here are basically the underground storage chambers that will handle the stormwater runoff.

704
01:12:43,278 --> 01:12:50,042
And then we have two discharge points to the east here that will discharge eventually into the existing wetland.

705
01:12:53,053 --> 01:12:56,414
Uh, drainage, so this is the, the landscape plan.

706
01:12:56,434 --> 01:13:06,878
Um, so basically the landscaping will consist of parking lot shade trees, which will be, um, uh, maples, Linden and sweet gum.

707
01:13:08,921 --> 01:13:27,429
The tree-lined streetscape will consist of Princeton Century Ginkgo, and then we have some evergreen buffer plantings along the easterly property line that'll consist of Fraser Fir, Eastern Red Cedar, Spruce, and Apervitae.

708
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:34,512
And then we also have some ornamental plantings up against the building and within the outdoor gathering area.

709
01:13:36,377 --> 01:13:44,465
And the photometrics plan was also submitted as part of the filing, just shows the foot candle distribution throughout the site.

710
01:13:45,425 --> 01:13:51,691
Light fixtures will be full dark sky compliant, full cutoff fixtures with a mounting height of 20 feet.

711
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:59,583
And then these next couple of slides to show the vehicular circulation through the site.

712
01:14:00,103 --> 01:14:02,985
So this first one is for the fire apparatus.

713
01:14:03,925 --> 01:14:16,753
This would be the most restrictive movement through the site, approaching the site from Commercial Street from the south, entering the central driveway, and then maneuvering around the entire building, and then exiting out to the north.

714
01:14:17,273 --> 01:14:21,055
So no restrictions with that movement.

715
01:14:22,036 --> 01:14:26,679
And then the second movement here is showing the truck traffic into the site.

716
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:38,607
This is a WB67 tractor trailer maneuvering to the site and then backing into the loading docks located here and then maneuver out the site through the central driveway.

717
01:14:41,949 --> 01:14:48,274
And with that, I will turn it over to Edwin Artray from TRIA to discuss the architectural plans.

718
01:14:49,134 --> 01:14:49,575
Thanks, James.

719
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:55,802
So now that we understand the siting, we'll take a look at the building plans and elevations.

720
01:14:56,202 --> 01:14:59,303
So James mentioned two overlapping rectangles.

721
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:09,666
We really felt strongly that the building should not be a very simple cost effective box, that this is a more ambitious project and the city deserves that.

722
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:20,430
But at the same time, not an awkward shape that introduces inefficiencies in the floor plans and makes it difficult to lay out efficient laboratory spaces.

723
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:27,890
We've worked for many life sciences tenants and put them into many of those glass towers in the seaport.

724
01:15:28,830 --> 01:15:36,792
And we have a pretty good sense of what features make a building attractive on the sidewalk and which ones make it useful as a life sciences home.

725
01:15:37,212 --> 01:15:41,113
And we're focusing on the efficient life sciences home characteristics.

726
01:15:42,048 --> 01:15:45,351
So what we have are two overlapping rectangles, essentially.

727
01:15:45,371 --> 01:15:52,496
This plan is oriented just like the site plan with Commercial Street at the bottom of the page and the parking lot to the right.

728
01:15:53,637 --> 01:15:55,018
This is the first floor plan.

729
01:15:55,698 --> 01:15:59,141
And in the lower right-hand corner, we have a built-in entrance lobby.

730
01:15:59,801 --> 01:16:07,567
And we're thinking of the lobby not like a monumental entrance, but more of a collaboration and interaction space for the tenants of the building.

731
01:16:08,128 --> 01:16:10,890
Could be for informal interaction, could be for symposium.

732
01:16:11,455 --> 01:16:16,898
but essentially indicative and thematic of a home for research.

733
01:16:18,019 --> 01:16:21,601
The tenant spaces then would be flanking on the lower left and the upper right.

734
01:16:22,282 --> 01:16:24,203
And we've got large contiguous floor plates.

735
01:16:24,563 --> 01:16:29,586
It would work for one tenant who needs a big footprint, or it could work for smaller tenants.

736
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:36,311
And they would all have ample perimeter for daylight, as well as access to the lobby.

737
01:16:36,871 --> 01:16:39,293
The shared building functions are on the back side of the building,

738
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:54,703
The other front of the building, as we sometimes say, the loading dock, I think, which James walked us through the truck access, is in the upper left, right, upper left, and the shared mechanical spaces are on that side of the building as well.

739
01:16:56,024 --> 01:17:02,671
There's a central toilet core, of course, for the building and exit stairs for the two floors of this building.

740
01:17:04,355 --> 01:17:24,772
On the second floor, which is the next slide, the footprint is essentially identical to the first floor, with the exception of the cutout for the two-story lobby and the shared building infrastructure spaces, which essentially are all located on the first floor.

741
01:17:28,415 --> 01:17:29,796
Moving on to the elevations,

742
01:17:30,858 --> 01:17:43,546
We believe that this building should be modern in its expression and reflect the technology-driven uses inside the building.

743
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:47,928
And to that end, we're thinking the building should be metal and glass.

744
01:17:49,049 --> 01:17:58,695
The elevations we're looking at here, the top elevation is the commercial street elevation, and the elevation beneath it is the elevation that faces the parking lot.

745
01:18:00,459 --> 01:18:12,208
two-story building with a mechanical roof, not a mechanical penthouse, but there is a mechanical screen, a roof screen along the roof to shield the view of the mechanical equipment.

746
01:18:13,549 --> 01:18:28,501
The materials for the building we're thinking should be metal panel and glass, again, modern, and its expression being vertical rather than horizontal, like many buildings you've seen along the highway.

747
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:31,021
with the horizontal ribbon windows.

748
01:18:33,043 --> 01:18:39,248
The glass is shown in the light blue, and they're the taller vertical openings.

749
01:18:40,369 --> 01:18:49,897
For the glass, we're certainly thinking the glass should be clear and not bronze or mirrored like, again, many of the buildings you've seen that have that sort of use.

750
01:18:51,162 --> 01:18:55,586
And as far as the metal goes, we're thinking that the metal panels are flat.

751
01:18:56,127 --> 01:19:03,374
And when we say flat, we mean smooth as opposed to corrugated or textured like an industrial metal panel.

752
01:19:03,794 --> 01:19:07,297
So this would be a finished metal panel, not an industrial panel.

753
01:19:08,318 --> 01:19:14,244
And that the interest in the facade would come from subtle variations in the color of the metal

754
01:19:14,909 --> 01:19:20,270
panels, and in some cases, a very slight difference in the texture.

755
01:19:21,371 --> 01:19:28,952
One color, so as to not be garish, but subtle texture across the metal panels themselves.

756
01:19:30,273 --> 01:19:39,695
If we go to the next two elevations, which are the other fronts of the building, if you will, the expression would be the same, and the materials would be the same.

757
01:19:40,235 --> 01:19:42,815
because we want the building to have a sense of integrity about it.

758
01:19:43,256 --> 01:19:53,377
There are folks walking around the building to get to the shopping center, and we don't want the building to fall apart from a visual and qualitative standpoint as you get around the corner.

759
01:19:55,858 --> 01:20:09,780
The subtle difference would be that because those shared mechanical spaces and sometimes the loading areas are going to be on that side of the building, there would probably be a little bit less glass because it doesn't make sense to introduce glass into a mechanical

760
01:20:10,532 --> 01:20:14,735
an electrical room, for example, or a fire pump room, for example.

761
01:20:16,376 --> 01:20:30,847
We have some three-dimensional views coming up that will give you a better sense of what the physical, the formal characteristics of the building are, as well as the landscaping.

762
01:20:32,388 --> 01:20:38,433
To talk a little bit further about the metal panel expression and to maybe reinforce what we think is a modern expression

763
01:20:39,143 --> 01:20:44,367
These are examples of buildings that employ the materials in the way that we're describing them.

764
01:20:45,548 --> 01:20:55,895
On the upper left, a metal and glass building, obviously, and the glass is used around the primary entrance to the building and the public spaces, the lobby.

765
01:20:55,915 --> 01:21:00,179
Going to go back to calling it an interaction area in a second.

766
01:21:00,879 --> 01:21:05,843
But we think that that's the appropriate way to enter the building with a lot of glass and very welcoming.

767
01:21:06,797 --> 01:21:14,038
If you look at the upper portion of that building, you'll see that there is a very subtle variation in the texture of the metal panels.

768
01:21:14,778 --> 01:21:18,759
And we're thinking that that's the effect that we're looking at.

769
01:21:19,959 --> 01:21:29,501
On the far right is another building with metal panel, but there is a grill of metal fins in front of the building.

770
01:21:30,321 --> 01:21:36,402
We have a canopy on the commercial street side of the building that's really a sunscreen.

771
01:21:36,926 --> 01:21:41,990
to help shield the sun from the glass at the lobby, the interaction area.

772
01:21:42,651 --> 01:21:51,078
And so we're thinking that that sort of play between solid metal elements floating in front of glass is a nice feature.

773
01:21:52,540 --> 01:22:01,988
On the lower left elevation, this is pretty, in some ways, from a proportional standpoint, very similar to the Innovation Center.

774
01:22:02,408 --> 01:22:03,930
There are large expanses of glass.

775
01:22:04,702 --> 01:22:06,163
The windows are large.

776
01:22:06,203 --> 01:22:07,624
These are horizontal windows.

777
01:22:08,224 --> 01:22:15,508
But the virtue of the large windows is that you get a lot of daylight into that deep floor plate, which is great.

778
01:22:15,608 --> 01:22:18,050
It will help reduce the actual lighting cost.

779
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:25,094
But more importantly, as importantly, people are working in this building for many, many hours.

780
01:22:25,194 --> 01:22:31,858
And their ability to have views out to the city, to the landscape court, in some cases, maybe into the lobby,

781
01:22:32,764 --> 01:22:37,206
is incredibly important to reduce eye strain and also to make the space livable.

782
01:22:38,167 --> 01:22:51,634
You're probably hearing that machines are taking over research, but that is happening, but there are still people working in research buildings for a very long time, and it's very important to have daylight and views out.

783
01:22:52,614 --> 01:22:53,515
The image on the right

784
01:22:54,897 --> 01:23:22,420
We're thinking that this is helpful to see because of the plaza adjacent to the building and the idea that that plaza is a visual amenity to the city, of course, for folks walking and traveling down Commercial Street, but also as an amenity to the building, and done so in a way that the occupants on a daily basis feel free to walk out, have lunch, have an informal chat, a collaboration session,

785
01:23:22,941 --> 01:23:27,063
and that it's much more than just eye candy, so to speak.

786
01:23:27,143 --> 01:23:28,404
It's really a usable space.

787
01:23:32,766 --> 01:23:34,087
And can we go to the next slide?

788
01:23:37,328 --> 01:23:37,949
So this is it.

789
01:23:38,269 --> 01:23:39,530
You've heard the term Tuftec.

790
01:23:39,570 --> 01:23:40,950
We've mentioned that a couple of times.

791
01:23:42,431 --> 01:23:45,893
Boston has a tremendous amount of wet laboratory space available.

792
01:23:46,532 --> 01:23:52,614
And an underserved community on the research side at the moment is what's often known as tough tech.

793
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:59,397
And tough tech can be companies that are maybe doing battery research.

794
01:24:00,037 --> 01:24:03,819
It can be companies who are doing medical device research and manufacturing.

795
01:24:04,779 --> 01:24:13,783
And the key differences between those manufacturing and research activities and the wet laboratory environment are the robustness

796
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:21,314
of the laboratory spaces themselves and the volume required for those activities to occur.

797
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:28,898
On the robustness side, this image essentially is one of a battery manufacturing facility.

798
01:24:29,798 --> 01:24:39,443
And so the laboratory benches, for example, need to be much more robust and heavy duty than the typical laboratory benches you would see in a wet laboratory environment.

799
01:24:40,043 --> 01:24:41,424
The benchtop equipment is heavier.

800
01:24:41,504 --> 01:24:42,905
The work that they're doing is heavier.

801
01:24:43,872 --> 01:24:47,013
And as a result, that's a very different kind of environment.

802
01:24:49,214 --> 01:25:00,780
It's not an environment where you have a low ceiling of nine feet and a distribution system of overhead service panels with wires and hoses coming down to distribute lab gases.

803
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:02,360
It's very different.

804
01:25:02,380 --> 01:25:04,181
There's a lot of power requirements.

805
01:25:04,201 --> 01:25:05,582
There's a lot of data requirements.

806
01:25:06,342 --> 01:25:12,645
There are often materials handling requirements, overhead crane rails, overhead ventilation devices.

807
01:25:13,182 --> 01:25:18,865
All of those features require more clearance in order to install and in order to use effectively.

808
01:25:19,405 --> 01:25:25,708
And that is what drives the additional floor to ceiling height, which we were allowed the variance for.

809
01:25:27,129 --> 01:25:29,029
And so this image sort of captures all those things.

810
01:25:29,470 --> 01:25:39,154
The floor to floor height, or rather the clear height to building structure in this image in this building is 17 feet, 20 to the underside or to the roof deck.

811
01:25:39,895 --> 01:25:42,676
And every bit of it would be absolutely necessary.

812
01:25:44,073 --> 01:25:54,041
In this image, we're also showing a view potentially through the lobby, into the lobby, and then beyond down to the outdoor gathering space.

813
01:25:54,621 --> 01:25:58,544
And that's in part for quality of life.

814
01:25:58,705 --> 01:26:03,268
There's certainly confidentiality issues and not every tenant would want to take advantage of that.

815
01:26:03,949 --> 01:26:07,892
There are films that can be applied to the window to decrease the

816
01:26:08,687 --> 01:26:09,948
and legibility of the view.

817
01:26:10,468 --> 01:26:29,481
But in general, this kind of views between spaces and the sense of openness and the sense that it's a building about collaboration and research and innovation and people being together and working together is really sort of a philosophical theme that is driving the project from our standpoint.

818
01:26:31,683 --> 01:26:31,863
Jim?

819
01:26:33,484 --> 01:26:33,864
Thanks Ed.

820
01:26:35,025 --> 01:26:43,532
So we'll just run through a couple of slides for some of the site precedent images and then we have some views looking through traveling through the site.

821
01:26:44,053 --> 01:26:49,197
So these are some of the trees and landscape material that I was mentioning earlier.

822
01:26:49,827 --> 01:27:00,190
Within the parking lot, the October Glory Red Maple, the Linden, and the Sweetgum, both showing the summer condition and the fall color.

823
01:27:01,411 --> 01:27:08,873
The Princeton Century Ginkgo would be along the streetscape, along Commercial Street, and then along the connection to the shopping plaza.

824
01:27:09,815 --> 01:27:14,177
And then the paperbark maple and heritage river birch would be closer to the building.

825
01:27:15,537 --> 01:27:20,199
We have the heritage river birch within the courtyard and our outdoor gathering area.

826
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:35,365
And then just some of the evergreen trees that we're proposing for the perimeter buffer mentioned before, Fraser fir, Eastern red cedar, spruce, everbody, and then some understory gray owl juniper.

827
01:27:37,224 --> 01:27:44,249
And then these are more of the plantings along the facade of the building and within the outdoor gathering area.

828
01:27:44,609 --> 01:27:49,873
Try to select plant material with a mixture of color and texture just to kind of keep things interesting.

829
01:27:53,236 --> 01:27:59,841
And then these are some proposed views that kind of give you a better feel of what the site would look like.

830
01:28:00,886 --> 01:28:06,189
So this is an existing area of view looking up commercial street, which is located here.

831
01:28:06,209 --> 01:28:11,372
If you're familiar with the area, this is the CubeSmart building, Arcadia Foods here.

832
01:28:12,193 --> 01:28:17,956
This is the building on our site, Harbor Freights here, and Stop and Shop is located off to the right here.

833
01:28:17,996 --> 01:28:24,460
So this is a view under existing conditions, and then this is what we're proposing the site to look like.

834
01:28:27,647 --> 01:28:33,853
So parking, as I mentioned before, to the to the south, which would be screened by the natural wetland.

835
01:28:35,955 --> 01:28:38,498
And then I'll just run through a series of views here.

836
01:28:38,638 --> 01:28:43,282
So this is more of a bird's eye view from commercial street looking back into the site.

837
01:28:44,163 --> 01:28:44,824
I can see the.

838
01:28:47,074 --> 01:28:53,918
the indoor lobby area or communal space, and then the outdoor gathering area located here.

839
01:28:54,439 --> 01:29:00,062
So the function between the indoor space and the outdoor space was thought out.

840
01:29:01,751 --> 01:29:04,733
And then this is more of a vehicular approach to the site.

841
01:29:05,514 --> 01:29:08,556
The view that you would get as you enter the site in a vehicle.

842
01:29:09,297 --> 01:29:17,163
And then this would be more of a pedestrian approach to the site from the commercial street sidewalk along walking towards the front of the building.

843
01:29:19,124 --> 01:29:22,327
And then this would be walking towards the outdoor gathering area.

844
01:29:22,347 --> 01:29:30,433
You can kind of see the connection between the indoor space and the outdoor space and some areas for seating and gathering, as I mentioned earlier.

845
01:29:32,531 --> 01:29:36,932
just a different view from inside that space, looking back towards the front of the building.

846
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:44,894
And this is more towards the rear of the site, looking towards Commercial Street, the CubeSmart off in the distance here.

847
01:29:47,135 --> 01:29:51,556
And just a view of the loading dock in the back, you see a screen from the adjacent property.

848
01:29:51,576 --> 01:29:58,658
And more of another bird's eye view from Commercial Street, looking back into the site and kind of see some of the,

849
01:30:01,323 --> 01:30:05,027
Boston Skyline in the background, Encore Casino located here.

850
01:30:05,047 --> 01:30:10,253
And then we have a kind of a fly-through video of the site.

851
01:30:41,550 --> 01:30:50,255
And then just gives you an idea of some adjacent landmarks in the area, proximity to where we are.

852
01:30:52,377 --> 01:30:53,017
Thank you, James.

853
01:30:53,638 --> 01:30:54,478
So Adam Dash again.

854
01:30:54,498 --> 01:30:55,799
So let me sum up here.

855
01:30:55,959 --> 01:31:09,508
As you can see, the project will greatly enhance an underutilized industrial property by creating a magnet for good tech jobs in Medford, which has a history of making cutting edge things, going back to the Clippership days.

856
01:31:10,348 --> 01:31:26,280
providing stormwater control, decreasing the impervious area, providing a walkway to the amenities to the north by the stop and shop, creating a more attractive streetscape, replacing the old industrial use with the cleaner use, and adding a stylish new building to the city.

857
01:31:27,221 --> 01:31:33,085
As Evan said, we did respond to the comments which came in late from the city engineering and traffic departments.

858
01:31:33,725 --> 01:31:38,269
I know that the traffic department basically said they were fine with it because we were doing everything they asked us to do.

859
01:31:38,989 --> 01:31:46,078
which had to do with crosswalks and such, not so much the building and the project as much as it had to do with crosswalks and ramps, which we're happy to do.

860
01:31:46,678 --> 01:31:49,902
But to do all of this, the applicant requires site plan review from this board.

861
01:31:49,922 --> 01:31:57,031
The project, after all this, is therefore not substantially more detrimental to the property or to the neighborhood than the

862
01:31:57,551 --> 01:32:00,252
current poor state of the property with its dirty uses.

863
01:32:01,072 --> 01:32:05,734
I would note that the mayor issued a letter of support in February 27th to the Zoning Board of Appeals.

864
01:32:05,774 --> 01:32:08,135
I don't know if you've seen it, but it's certainly relevant here.

865
01:32:08,795 --> 01:32:09,676
It's fairly short.

866
01:32:09,876 --> 01:32:17,619
It says, I'm writing in favor of the Felsway Innovation Center located at 48 and 64 Commercial Street and the site plan they are proposing.

867
01:32:18,319 --> 01:32:23,341
The project has been reviewed by our economic development team and the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability.

868
01:32:24,041 --> 01:32:25,362
I'm sorry, there goes a fire truck.

869
01:32:26,963 --> 01:32:38,288
Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, this is a 100,000 square foot technology and life science building that will help transform that area of our industrial corridor and in turn will help grow our commercial tax base.

870
01:32:38,768 --> 01:32:48,393
As I've done in the past, I will continue to lend my support to projects such as this one that will provide significant benefits to our community, including numerous job opportunities for our talent pool.

871
01:32:49,533 --> 01:33:06,503
Um, so therefore the applicant respect the request that the board approve the site plan review for the new building of greater than 10 000 square feet Thank you Thank you attorney dash, thank you everyone Um

872
01:33:12,668 --> 01:33:21,134
I do have some clarifying questions, but I'm just not sure where the conditions lie at right now.

873
01:33:21,534 --> 01:33:28,639
Danielle, do you want to give, I know that you haven't had a chance, but is there anything that's specific that's standing out from the city right now?

874
01:33:28,659 --> 01:33:31,981
Because I just want to make sure we get that clear.

875
01:33:34,523 --> 01:33:41,448
Basically, I need to determine what, so,

876
01:33:43,131 --> 01:33:51,717
essentially any conditions that were required by the department heads that create changes on the plans.

877
01:33:53,418 --> 01:34:06,946
Ideally we have the changes are made on the plans and then we don't have to have the condition in the decision is it makes when it comes down to the building permit and the CO becomes kind of cumbersome when they get very long.

878
01:34:08,007 --> 01:34:10,048
I do wanna know one thing that,

879
01:34:13,817 --> 01:34:16,458
was not caught earlier.

880
01:34:18,859 --> 01:34:23,962
So there's the provision 94-6.3.5 for large parking areas.

881
01:34:24,682 --> 01:34:32,406
And it looks like we might need to add a few more landscaped islands.

882
01:34:32,986 --> 01:34:39,349
One of the rules is that you can't have more than 20 spaces uninterrupted by a landscaped island.

883
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:40,290
And

884
01:34:43,189 --> 01:34:49,955
It looks like there's a few places that have just 25 spaces in the front.

885
01:34:50,915 --> 01:34:53,017
And then it's just really, really small.

886
01:34:53,998 --> 01:34:56,560
I can't see 28.

887
01:35:00,063 --> 01:35:07,349
So are you able to accommodate that and rejigger the parking a little bit?

888
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:11,272
I noticed that the parking requirements are

889
01:35:12,723 --> 01:35:22,140
one space for every two employees, and that 200 and how many employees?

890
01:35:23,042 --> 01:35:26,423
Well, Adam Dasch again, we don't have a tenant.

891
01:35:26,544 --> 01:35:32,586
This is a spec building, so we're sort of approximating how many employees this type of use would employ.

892
01:35:33,306 --> 01:35:40,630
Obviously, different tenants will have different numbers of employees, so it's a little hard to say, but that's sort of what we're going off of what we believe.

893
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:48,633
That's why we have Patrick Bradleys here, our traffic engineer, and they've helped come up with using the UT, you know, the books, I forget.

894
01:35:48,913 --> 01:35:56,889
I'm probably saying the acronym incorrectly, Patrick, but if you want to tackle that, I don't know about the traffic island question, though that was not raised earlier.

895
01:35:57,129 --> 01:35:57,370
Go ahead.

896
01:35:58,871 --> 01:36:03,432
Yeah, Patrick Bradley, I was also not aware of the Jeff Allen question.

897
01:36:03,592 --> 01:36:10,573
I know there were a couple comments from the city in that letter we received last week about parking.

898
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:13,094
So I know we have to make some changes there.

899
01:36:13,174 --> 01:36:18,955
So I believe we're looking to seeing how we can reconfigure the parking there.

900
01:36:19,655 --> 01:36:25,936
And you came up with the number of the proposed employees from the manuals in your field, I would assume.

901
01:36:28,157 --> 01:36:32,141
I'm sorry, I'm just saying we're having a hard time hearing you, Adam.

902
01:36:32,181 --> 01:36:34,343
I didn't hear what that question was.

903
01:36:34,483 --> 01:36:50,037
Either you, James, or Patrick, I mean that the number of parking spaces, the question that was raised, the number of parking spaces based on the number of employees had to be estimated based on, you know, standards in the field that are used to determine such things because we don't have an actual tenant with a headcount right now.

904
01:36:51,959 --> 01:36:52,159
Right.

905
01:36:53,691 --> 01:36:58,193
Yeah, the site plans right now are we're showing about 214 parking spaces.

906
01:36:58,213 --> 01:37:02,615
So that would be 428 employees for this type of facility.

907
01:37:02,635 --> 01:37:11,060
Um, so, you know, these are these are, you know, welcome comments that, um, you know, we were hoping for and.

908
01:37:12,340 --> 01:37:18,948
We anticipate that we're going to have to change the site plans for certain things to address some of the comments that we received to date.

909
01:37:20,270 --> 01:37:22,853
Obviously, parking is one of them.

910
01:37:23,053 --> 01:37:31,263
Some of the comments for stormwater really won't affect the site plan all that much, but we kind of wanted to get all the comments first before we revise the plans.

911
01:37:33,128 --> 01:38:02,275
and then we certainly understand that the board's not comfortable voting tonight with conditions that that's that's fine we can certainly make changes and come back that's we're not trying to shove this down anybody's throats but yeah i mean you could one could do it either way as danielle said one could either approve what we submitted with the condition that we if that we change the plans to accommodate the comments that have been received by the departments or we could come back with plans that have the changes already made on them either way it's the same thing to us but

912
01:38:03,055 --> 01:38:07,199
however you'd like to proceed is fine and then the traffic island issue we'll certainly look into that.

913
01:38:09,941 --> 01:38:17,827
And Madam Chair I'm happy to talk offline to just do a check before you submit it just to make sure that everything's in there.

914
01:38:18,428 --> 01:38:26,895
Our ordinance things are some of these provisions are buried so if you didn't if you missed it I don't blame you you missed it.

915
01:38:27,075 --> 01:38:29,957
Yeah well we rely on those refusal letters you know so yeah.

916
01:38:34,705 --> 01:38:35,626
That's all I have, Madam Chair.

917
01:38:37,748 --> 01:38:42,232
Does any member of the board have questions at this time?

918
01:38:43,212 --> 01:38:44,454
Vice Chair Emily Edelman?

919
01:38:46,115 --> 01:38:47,256
Thank you, Chair McPherson.

920
01:38:47,276 --> 01:38:55,243
I had a little trouble answering this question on my own based on the drawings in the presentation, so I just figured I'd raise it.

921
01:38:56,121 --> 01:39:07,578
Is there any sort of pedestrian access between this building and the stop and shop, you know, Harbor Freight, Ocean State Job Lots, plazas?

922
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:33,050
there is a uh... there is a uh... i guess jim if you want to pull up the plan we can show there is a pedestrian access to the stop-and-shop site which is obviously stop-and-shop would probably love to have these customers of all these employees who may want to go over there for lunch or go to panera over there uh... i'm sure it's an amenity for us it's an amenity for them so everybody wins if we create that connection uh... it is on the site plan of james will pull it up we can show you where it is there

923
01:39:33,554 --> 01:39:34,595
that sidewalk in the back.

924
01:39:34,955 --> 01:39:35,755
Yeah, that tree line.

925
01:39:36,276 --> 01:39:38,477
Yeah, this would be the connection we're proposing.

926
01:39:38,997 --> 01:39:39,658
Yeah, that's great.

927
01:39:39,818 --> 01:39:40,218
I love it.

928
01:39:41,038 --> 01:39:52,805
I think this brings, you know, dynamic activity to an otherwise unused site, you know, increases Medford's tax income.

929
01:39:53,766 --> 01:39:55,347
So I'm excited to see this here.

930
01:39:55,387 --> 01:39:57,548
And I understand that there are limitations, you know,

931
01:39:58,265 --> 01:40:02,528
based on the site's environmental conditions today in terms of the parking.

932
01:40:02,548 --> 01:40:18,739
So while I would have loved to see permeable pavers and maybe some other creative approaches, I understand that there's some limitations to make sure that the site remains safe for the city and for the occupants.

933
01:40:19,780 --> 01:40:20,040
Thank you.

934
01:40:26,333 --> 01:40:26,814
Thank you.

935
01:40:26,834 --> 01:40:30,780
Ari Fishman?

936
01:40:33,003 --> 01:40:33,865
Thank you, Madam Chair.

937
01:40:35,869 --> 01:40:39,030
echo Vice Chair Hedeman's excitement about this project.

938
01:40:39,070 --> 01:40:41,551
I think it's a great use of a very neglected space.

939
01:40:42,091 --> 01:40:46,173
I do want to flag about the landscaping.

940
01:40:46,253 --> 01:40:53,255
I appreciate that the maples aren't Norway maples, but I think many of the others were not native varietals.

941
01:40:53,495 --> 01:41:03,039
And given how close this is to the wetlands and the Mystic River and its lands are right across the highway, I would really love to see this be

942
01:41:04,092 --> 01:41:05,833
pretty much all native plants.

943
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:10,896
There's going to be a lot of cross-pollination, and hopefully it'll make the space stronger, too.

944
01:41:12,037 --> 01:41:17,560
I don't know that we have the legal standing to require it, but I think it would be a great decision.

945
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:21,963
Thank you.

946
01:41:22,223 --> 01:41:23,224
And Peter Kals?

947
01:41:27,426 --> 01:41:27,926
You're on mute.

948
01:41:29,610 --> 01:41:34,872
I just wanted to echo my fellow board members and the excitement for this project.

949
01:41:35,052 --> 01:41:42,174
As a resident of this neighborhood, it's always nice to see something going into one of these underused industrial sites.

950
01:41:43,774 --> 01:41:54,898
And I did go through Director Blake's comments, and I appreciate Chapel Engineering on the traffic side of everything they're doing to

951
01:41:56,708 --> 01:42:01,569
make that kind of neglected stretch of commercial street adjacent to the site better.

952
01:42:02,029 --> 01:42:02,789
So thank you for that.

953
01:42:10,191 --> 01:42:15,032
And I just wanted to echo Vice Chair Hederman's questioning on the pedestrian.

954
01:42:15,092 --> 01:42:18,233
I did see the link with the trees there.

955
01:42:18,273 --> 01:42:20,033
That was one of the questions that I actually

956
01:42:25,027 --> 01:42:27,450
So to my delight, that has been addressed.

957
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:29,992
So that would have been my only other thing.

958
01:42:31,314 --> 01:42:43,666
Seeing no more questions from the board, I am going to open it up for public comment at this time, since it is a public hearing, and I'll read the public notice.

959
01:42:44,657 --> 01:42:49,880
The Memphis Community Development Board shall conduct a meeting on March 20th, 2024 after 6.30 p.m.

960
01:42:49,960 --> 01:43:04,970
via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to an application for site plan review for a new non-residential structure of more than 10,000 square feet, making it a major project and submitted by Empire Management Corporation of 171 Great Road, active mass.

961
01:43:06,891 --> 01:43:09,973
I don't believe we need to read the second part of the notice.

962
01:43:15,868 --> 01:43:16,910
since we've already read it.

963
01:43:16,990 --> 01:43:18,372
So now I will open it up.

964
01:43:18,793 --> 01:43:19,815
My apologies to

965
01:43:22,322 --> 01:43:26,845
Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

966
01:43:26,865 --> 01:43:31,147
You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

967
01:43:31,547 --> 01:43:34,849
Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

968
01:43:35,210 --> 01:43:42,374
A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

969
01:43:42,774 --> 01:43:48,978
However, if a participant is having audio or other technical difficulties, this may be entered into the chat to alert myself and staff.

970
01:43:50,534 --> 01:43:50,734
questions.

971
01:43:50,754 --> 01:43:50,914
Daniel.

972
01:43:50,934 --> 01:43:55,316
Can you please manage the public comment queue and read any comments that have come in prior to.

973
01:43:56,697 --> 01:43:58,058
But the letters or emails.

974
01:44:00,939 --> 01:44:01,460
Madam chair.

975
01:44:01,500 --> 01:44:05,202
I do not see any members of the public with their hands raised.

976
01:44:06,082 --> 01:44:06,322
Um.

977
01:44:08,443 --> 01:44:11,425
I don't believe I received any public

978
01:44:22,657 --> 01:44:28,723
I can check our general mailbox to see if anything has come in.

979
01:44:28,743 --> 01:44:31,825
I may have missed.

980
01:44:36,550 --> 01:44:38,291
I don't see anything that has come in tonight.

981
01:44:39,052 --> 01:44:41,675
So that's all we have.

982
01:44:42,035 --> 01:44:43,056
Oh, never mind.

983
01:44:43,236 --> 01:44:44,797
That's Emily with her hand raised.

984
01:44:48,922 --> 01:44:57,647
Okay, I'm going to close the public comment period for this meeting, and I will open it back up for board deliberation, starting with Vice Chair Hedeman.

985
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:00,608
Thank you, Chair McPherson.

986
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:13,955
I know that Peter is our go-to traffic expert, but as somebody who frequently takes that left turn onto Commercial Street to sneak into stop and shop that way and avoid, you know,

987
01:45:18,398 --> 01:45:21,480
the insane intersection of Felsway and Route 16.

988
01:45:21,560 --> 01:45:36,568
I was a little curious about the traffic implications on Commercial Street as well as coming out onto Mystic Valley Parkway.

989
01:45:36,588 --> 01:45:47,534
I'm sure that they're summarized in the applicant's materials, but I was wondering if there could be a quick narrative in terms of mitigating

990
01:45:48,728 --> 01:45:49,148
efforts.

991
01:45:50,709 --> 01:46:02,976
And for additional context, I believe we did have a courtesy review of a multi-family residential property at the intersection of Commercial and Mystic Valley Parkway.

992
01:46:03,036 --> 01:46:07,578
So there could be a lot of traffic activity in this area.

993
01:46:07,598 --> 01:46:14,042
And the last thing I'll add is curious if the applicant is

994
01:46:15,786 --> 01:46:23,914
pursuing the use of a shuttle service to go back and forth to Wellington to, you know, further support use of public transit.

995
01:46:27,037 --> 01:46:32,964
Maybe the time, Jim, to have Patrick go through some things that might make things a little clearer.

996
01:46:34,485 --> 01:46:35,987
You want to call those slides up?

997
01:47:02,776 --> 01:47:11,527
So, in regards to the question about the traffic impacts, specifically, and Mississippi Parkway and Riverside Avenue.

998
01:47:12,608 --> 01:47:14,751
We had found through our traffic study that.

999
01:47:16,113 --> 01:47:27,102
The impacts from traffic during both peak AM and PM hours would be pretty minimal for all intersections included in this, which you can see the six called out here.

1000
01:47:28,343 --> 01:47:35,930
We saw that there would be increases in delay of less than two seconds at all intersections, even less than one second.

1001
01:47:36,510 --> 01:47:44,437
So in regards to the impact of traffic on these areas, it seemed pretty minimal with the increase in this development.

1002
01:47:56,918 --> 01:47:59,659
member had raised, uh, Patrick, that you could answer.

1003
01:48:00,739 --> 01:48:01,560
Peter Kautz.

1004
01:48:04,901 --> 01:48:18,625
Just real quick before Peter goes, um, is there any response to the suggestion of using, um, like a shuttle service or enacting some sort of like transportation management plan for this, this, um, facility?

1005
01:48:21,392 --> 01:48:25,956
I would say I'm not aware of any shuttle services that are currently going to be offered.

1006
01:48:26,036 --> 01:48:35,103
I know there's several public use bus stops within the area, which I think would be used by some employees.

1007
01:48:35,984 --> 01:48:44,871
As for shuttle service, I think that's something that could definitely be looked into if it's a service that would be utilized by the employees on site.

1008
01:48:47,072 --> 01:48:50,215
Yeah, I presume there's some additional detail on that for the next iteration.

1009
01:48:51,534 --> 01:48:51,894
Thank you.

1010
01:48:57,355 --> 01:48:57,955
Peter Cowes?

1011
01:48:59,936 --> 01:49:00,296
Yes.

1012
01:49:01,016 --> 01:49:14,019
My apologies, this is a little in the weeds question, but I'm curious as to the land use that you spec'd us at, it being a spec site and not having a specific

1013
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:20,164
a specific tenant in mind.

1014
01:49:21,225 --> 01:49:30,936
Just for clarification, as a fellow traffic engineer, if you were using the IT land uses, what were you looking at this as?

1015
01:49:32,123 --> 01:49:34,384
So we looked into two different land uses.

1016
01:49:34,925 --> 01:49:42,069
One was land use code 140, which is for a manufacturing facility, and the other was for land use code 760, which is for research and development.

1017
01:49:42,790 --> 01:49:47,733
We looked into both of those and determined that research and development 760 produced more traffic.

1018
01:49:47,893 --> 01:49:53,136
So we decided to be conservative in terms of the traffic generation use that for the facility.

1019
01:49:53,936 --> 01:49:55,878
Okay, thank you for the clarification.

1020
01:49:59,100 --> 01:49:59,740
Director Hunt?

1021
01:50:02,412 --> 01:50:03,433
Thank you, Madam Chair.

1022
01:50:03,953 --> 01:50:19,183
I just wanted to sort of provide, sorry, it's getting a little late, follow up on Emily's comments about mitigating the traffic and options around vanpooling and such.

1023
01:50:20,083 --> 01:50:28,849
Our office has just started to talk to the Lower Mystic TMA, which is a organization that provides

1024
01:50:29,369 --> 01:50:33,870
carpooling, van share, bike share for companies.

1025
01:50:34,331 --> 01:50:42,793
And they are centered around Everett, but they do serve Medford and particularly the Wellington area of Medford, which this is very close to.

1026
01:50:44,014 --> 01:50:51,676
And so there may, it seems to me if this was a company that we knew was moving in, I would say we should make it a requirement that they have to join this.

1027
01:50:53,743 --> 01:50:57,365
But at this point, it might be that I'm just offering it as a suggestion.

1028
01:50:57,805 --> 01:51:09,590
They have a level of membership called associate membership, which literally says associate membership refers to developments that are required or choose to join the TMA during the initial phases of their projects.

1029
01:51:10,110 --> 01:51:15,573
This level of membership allows the TMA to work with project managers to prepare for tenant move-in

1030
01:51:16,373 --> 01:51:19,795
and create plans for mitigating the transportation impacts of the site.

1031
01:51:20,375 --> 01:51:24,858
This level of membership is short term between project approval and building occupancy.

1032
01:51:25,338 --> 01:51:33,283
And then they have different levels of like, do your members all do your employees all get free bus passes and blue bike passes?

1033
01:51:33,743 --> 01:51:39,626
Or do you run a do they run a shuttle that connects your building to the T?

1034
01:51:40,186 --> 01:51:42,728
I'm very interested in seeing several of the

1035
01:51:43,208 --> 01:51:56,573
the larger and new developments in this area along Mystic Valley Parkway work together on a shuttle to the Wellington Tee and this lower Mystic TMA may be the answer to facilitate that.

1036
01:51:57,913 --> 01:52:08,537
I am not versed enough on this organization yet to say, I think you should require it tonight, but I wanted to offer it that it might be a solution.

1037
01:52:12,389 --> 01:52:27,205
I think that sounds like a wonderful program actually within the city and I think that's something we could definitely look into for the tenant use to apply for and try to use to mitigate kind of the amount of traffic going to and from the site.

1038
01:52:40,851 --> 01:52:41,431
Thank you all.

1039
01:52:41,571 --> 01:53:07,979
So to get some clarification from how the board is feeling, are you comfortable with, I have not been able to wrap my head around all of the conditions and I'm not sure that they are at this point more administrative things that the PDS office can handle with the applicant as long as they're accommodated for going forward, we can do a,

1040
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:17,085
actually a condition based on that, or did you want to have the applicant come back before us with a new set of plans?

1041
01:53:18,966 --> 01:53:20,688
I'm just trying to get more of a feel.

1042
01:53:20,708 --> 01:53:32,216
Madam chair, if I may, I prefer revised plans.

1043
01:53:34,357 --> 01:53:37,900
You guys can vote on it at the next meeting.

1044
01:53:38,465 --> 01:53:40,386
everything is in and it's ready to go.

1045
01:53:41,087 --> 01:53:42,688
Madam Chair, I was going to say the same.

1046
01:53:43,648 --> 01:53:46,230
Yeah, and just thank you.

1047
01:53:49,232 --> 01:53:50,353
And Peter Cowles?

1048
01:53:52,194 --> 01:54:06,003
I was going to say similarly, given that it seems the project team is not, it doesn't seem that it'd be great and convenient to them to come back with revised plans if they're fine with that and that's what we'd prefer, then that seems like the best path forward.

1049
01:54:09,765 --> 01:54:16,190
Okay, so I am going to, is there any other comments?

1050
01:54:16,491 --> 01:54:20,214
Okay, I'm going to look for a motion to continue.

1051
01:54:20,234 --> 01:54:28,080
4864 Commercial Street till the date certain, which is April 3rd.

1052
01:54:28,280 --> 01:54:31,042
I'll make a motion.

1053
01:54:39,755 --> 01:54:40,355
And a second.

1054
01:54:41,336 --> 01:54:41,636
Second.

1055
01:54:41,696 --> 01:54:42,216
I second.

1056
01:54:42,236 --> 01:54:44,837
Okay.

1057
01:54:44,897 --> 01:54:47,498
Attorney Dash, we will see you on April 3rd.

1058
01:54:47,538 --> 01:54:48,679
If you can please come back.

1059
01:54:48,699 --> 01:54:51,740
Vice chair, Emily Headman.

1060
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:52,060
Aye.

1061
01:54:52,100 --> 01:54:52,481
Peter Kowals.

1062
01:54:52,501 --> 01:54:54,702
Aye.

1063
01:54:54,742 --> 01:54:55,162
Ari Fishman.

1064
01:54:55,182 --> 01:54:55,242
Aye.

1065
01:55:07,653 --> 01:55:08,594
Pam Ariansky?

1066
01:55:09,194 --> 01:55:09,315
Aye.

1067
01:55:09,855 --> 01:55:11,817
And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.

1068
01:55:13,278 --> 01:55:15,060
Attorney Dash?

1069
01:55:15,380 --> 01:55:16,701
Yes, we'll see you.

1070
01:55:17,222 --> 01:55:17,963
Okay, thank you.

1071
01:55:18,083 --> 01:55:18,964
Have a great evening.

1072
01:55:19,384 --> 01:55:19,704
You too.

1073
01:55:19,724 --> 01:55:20,365
Thank you so much.

1074
01:55:20,505 --> 01:55:20,885
Thank you.

1075
01:55:21,326 --> 01:55:21,726
Thank you.

1076
01:55:23,047 --> 01:55:23,548
Thank you.

1077
01:55:32,017 --> 01:55:41,974
The next item on our list for tonight is 294 Harvard Street, which is a special permit to establish a motor vehicle repair establishment within an existing building.

1078
01:55:43,422 --> 01:55:48,705
The Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on March 20th, 2024, after 6.30 p.m.

1079
01:55:48,745 --> 01:56:02,914
via Zoom relative to an application by Damian DiNucci on behalf of Auto Glass now for a special permit for a motor vehicle establishment located in the industrial zone at 294 Harvard Street, Medford Mounds, 02155.

1080
01:56:04,735 --> 01:56:08,457
Danielle, Medford staff, can you please make any introductory comments?

1081
01:56:11,451 --> 01:56:13,132
Yes, thank you.

1082
01:56:14,192 --> 01:56:30,398
So as you may recall, back in September, there was some zoning changes that originated at the city council to change auto repair uses to require special permits within the city rather than by rights.

1083
01:56:30,418 --> 01:56:34,199
So this affects this property.

1084
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:37,961
It's a auto glass repair, which,

1085
01:56:40,390 --> 01:56:46,253
is the building commissioner, you know, determined that it's under that category and therefore requires a special permit.

1086
01:56:48,634 --> 01:56:52,095
I do want to note that there was an error on the agenda.

1087
01:56:52,115 --> 01:57:00,879
And the first one that came out that had the wrong address, it said 294 Maine, but the abutters notices were correct.

1088
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:03,080
Public hearing notice was correct.

1089
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:06,642
The legal ads were correct, but I think

1090
01:57:07,806 --> 01:57:20,873
that abundance of caution, it would make sense to open this, hear it, and then probably delay till the third to take a vote so that there's not procedural error, which would open up the applicant to an appeal.

1091
01:57:20,893 --> 01:57:27,436
I think that would be in their best interest, but I think it is also their risk tolerance.

1092
01:57:30,438 --> 01:57:34,720
That's all that I have at this time.

1093
01:57:37,310 --> 01:57:38,091
Can I speak?

1094
01:57:38,831 --> 01:57:39,132
Sorry.

1095
01:57:41,133 --> 01:57:44,575
I'm going to ask the applicant to introduce themselves.

1096
01:57:46,937 --> 01:57:47,637
Darren, go ahead.

1097
01:57:47,717 --> 01:57:48,278
My apologies.

1098
01:57:51,179 --> 01:57:51,440
Mute.

1099
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:52,360
OK.

1100
01:57:52,380 --> 01:57:53,241
Can you hear me now?

1101
01:57:53,881 --> 01:57:54,121
Yes.

1102
01:57:54,522 --> 01:57:54,762
OK.

1103
01:57:55,142 --> 01:57:55,942
Hi, everybody.

1104
01:57:56,283 --> 01:57:57,664
My name is Darren DiNucci.

1105
01:57:58,204 --> 01:57:59,985
I am the owner operator.

1106
01:58:00,345 --> 01:58:05,168
I have my business at 294 Harvard Street, and I've been solely

1107
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:10,754
occupying that property for a while, running my construction electrical business.

1108
01:58:11,554 --> 01:58:14,858
And I decided to take a tenant on due to some changes.

1109
01:58:15,678 --> 01:58:22,265
And we recently had a couple of tenants in there and they were okay and they had moved on.

1110
01:58:23,471 --> 01:58:32,037
And we engaged with Auto Glass now in about, oh, June or July, somewhere in that area.

1111
01:58:32,778 --> 01:58:36,300
So when we engaged, we were by right.

1112
01:58:36,620 --> 01:58:41,504
I had gone down to the commissioner's office and talked to the commissioner and the building inspectors.

1113
01:58:42,264 --> 01:58:51,391
And we were by right, as I always do when I get a tenant, I check because I am familiar with the special permit and have had to deal with that from time to time.

1114
01:58:52,448 --> 01:59:07,800
So unfortunately, Autoglass now and I engaged and they started investing in the project in terms of due diligence and checking into like, you know, hazardous waste and surveys and the things that the companies do before they engage in a lease.

1115
01:59:08,640 --> 01:59:17,287
At that point in time, we had, you know, it had been after September and we had come back in, you know, as we were doing due diligence thinking that,

1116
01:59:17,967 --> 01:59:21,869
We were going to put something together and get them in there.

1117
01:59:22,609 --> 01:59:26,951
In and around October 15th was our commencement date planned.

1118
01:59:27,831 --> 01:59:36,794
So at that point in time is when this news was brought to me, we stumbled upon it through the planning department and here we are in April.

1119
01:59:39,545 --> 01:59:42,609
The, you know, it's a little disappointing to me.

1120
01:59:42,949 --> 01:59:50,517
The building was built in 2012 and I purchased it in 15, 16, renovated it.

1121
01:59:51,138 --> 01:59:57,685
It was built as an industrial building with 19 foot base, which are very specific for, you know, for trucks to be

1122
01:59:58,426 --> 01:59:59,807
brought in their cars and trucks.

1123
02:00:00,568 --> 02:00:08,596
And it was built with an oil water separator, which is something that is required for any building to work on vehicles.

1124
02:00:09,277 --> 02:00:13,902
So this building was very specifically built to be able to do these types of things.

1125
02:00:15,283 --> 02:00:21,589
That being said, I understand the, you know, the thought process of the old

1126
02:00:22,738 --> 02:00:26,700
auto shop, if you will, with broken down cars and hoods up and then I get that part.

1127
02:00:27,480 --> 02:00:32,002
But if everybody had a chance to see the pictures, if not, we can certainly bring them up.

1128
02:00:32,682 --> 02:00:35,803
This is a very well maintained new building.

1129
02:00:36,783 --> 02:00:40,345
And, you know, it's state of the art solar panels on the roof.

1130
02:00:41,431 --> 02:00:44,273
card access, cameras, security.

1131
02:00:45,213 --> 02:00:54,258
We have the fencing, you know, all blocked out just, you know, for the good of our own use, you know, it wasn't done, you know, for any other reason, we take really good care of our stuff.

1132
02:00:54,558 --> 02:01:01,242
So I did, I have been vacant for almost a year now, because I passed on some tenants.

1133
02:01:02,163 --> 02:01:02,343
I am

1134
02:01:03,257 --> 02:01:06,359
very particular about my building and I am a tenant as well.

1135
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:13,285
I have had oil companies that wanted to come because they don't have any way to park their trucks and they're just delivery trucks.

1136
02:01:14,165 --> 02:01:18,489
I think by right I could do that, but I didn't have any interest in that.

1137
02:01:18,909 --> 02:01:20,210
I just don't want to smell oil.

1138
02:01:20,270 --> 02:01:30,558
I don't want to have trucks firing up big diesels at six in the morning and causing any harm for the neighborhood because I'm there too and I'm pretty good with all the neighbors.

1139
02:01:31,399 --> 02:01:32,680
I've had a doggy daycare.

1140
02:01:33,581 --> 02:01:49,504
that I thought was a pretty good idea, but they engaged, and they asked some questions to some planning board members, and they kind of did a little bit of due diligence, and then they kind of got a little bit of a negative feedback, and they didn't want to run through the special permit process, so we lost them.

1141
02:01:50,224 --> 02:01:55,165
I thought they would have been nice, but I do get it, the dog's barking, so they didn't want to take the chance.

1142
02:01:56,165 --> 02:01:58,445
I had a rental car place come over.

1143
02:01:59,806 --> 02:02:01,726
I didn't want them, and again,

1144
02:02:02,917 --> 02:02:06,318
I then met with the auto glass people and I thought it was a great fit.

1145
02:02:06,638 --> 02:02:08,779
Um, you know, it's, it's glass, it's clean.

1146
02:02:09,419 --> 02:02:10,399
Their hours are good.

1147
02:02:10,439 --> 02:02:11,540
They're like eight to five.

1148
02:02:12,020 --> 02:02:14,020
There's going to be like four or five employees.

1149
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:22,483
They're going to basically, you know, it's like a safety or a safe light glass, same type of a place where they do a lot of their stuff mobile.

1150
02:02:23,083 --> 02:02:27,284
But there are people that still want to go to a shop and we have a shop and

1151
02:02:28,110 --> 02:02:43,456
you know, unlike probably 99% of your auto shops in Medford, they probably do not have oil water separators, which essentially, if you don't know what that is, if the car goes inside and it leaks, it's environmentally safe, it separates the oil from the water.

1152
02:02:44,097 --> 02:02:49,379
And we have to have the MWRA come in annually to clean that and you know, keep the place safe.

1153
02:02:50,299 --> 02:02:54,561
So I was excited about them for tenant, I think they're going to be a great fit.

1154
02:02:54,841 --> 02:02:57,402
I think they're going to be low impact to the neighborhood.

1155
02:02:58,500 --> 02:03:01,844
And I think that's all I have.

1156
02:03:01,864 --> 02:03:03,566
And I'd like to introduce Timmy.

1157
02:03:03,626 --> 02:03:04,747
I'm sorry, Tim's on here.

1158
02:03:05,528 --> 02:03:06,889
And I don't know if Dan's on here.

1159
02:03:07,450 --> 02:03:09,552
They are the Autoglass representatives.

1160
02:03:10,173 --> 02:03:12,876
And we can certainly answer any questions.

1161
02:03:27,670 --> 02:03:29,151
Thank you, Mr. President.

1162
02:03:29,291 --> 02:03:33,795
Do you have a presentation for us this evening?

1163
02:03:33,815 --> 02:03:36,937
I mean, we did send in all the pictures.

1164
02:03:36,997 --> 02:03:40,520
Would anybody like to see the facility while we're talking together?

1165
02:03:40,580 --> 02:03:41,641
Tim, you can bring those up.

1166
02:03:41,721 --> 02:03:43,642
I know we presented them with the package.

1167
02:03:44,203 --> 02:03:46,585
Not sure if you had a chance to review them.

1168
02:03:46,645 --> 02:03:48,266
I'm Tim Hainer.

1169
02:03:48,326 --> 02:03:55,232
I'm one of the new unit growth managers for Autoglass now, and I handle some of the

1170
02:03:58,068 --> 02:03:59,950
the branding elements for our company.

1171
02:03:59,970 --> 02:04:03,393
Let me see if I can, how do I share the screen here?

1172
02:04:03,413 --> 02:04:08,558
Danielle, can you please give myself access?

1173
02:04:09,659 --> 02:04:10,400
Yes, I already did.

1174
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:18,648
You just hit share screen on the bottom and then just select the window that you would like to share.

1175
02:04:21,230 --> 02:04:21,951
Just give me one.

1176
02:04:21,991 --> 02:04:23,072
I'm sorry about that.

1177
02:04:29,222 --> 02:04:30,683
All right, can you see my screen now?

1178
02:04:31,483 --> 02:04:33,224
Yes.

1179
02:04:33,604 --> 02:04:36,546
So we only have a couple of things that we want to do to the building.

1180
02:04:36,586 --> 02:04:39,988
Basically, just make it recognizable as a Auto Glass Now Center.

1181
02:04:41,828 --> 02:04:47,711
Nothing that we do is anything more than repairing windshields.

1182
02:04:48,312 --> 02:04:50,273
Cars are not stacked in the parking lot.

1183
02:04:50,293 --> 02:04:51,653
We don't have cars there overnight.

1184
02:04:52,874 --> 02:04:58,437
Our area manager's on the call too, and he can clarify anything that I'm not saying correctly.

1185
02:04:59,017 --> 02:05:02,900
I don't deal with the operation side.

1186
02:05:02,940 --> 02:05:04,682
I just deal with the branding side.

1187
02:05:04,782 --> 02:05:14,330
So this is, aesthetically, all we would be doing to the building would just be an auto glass now sign.

1188
02:05:14,370 --> 02:05:15,371
We didn't want to paint anything.

1189
02:05:15,391 --> 02:05:17,132
We didn't want to change the look of the building.

1190
02:05:17,172 --> 02:05:19,994
We didn't want to change any aesthetics.

1191
02:05:20,455 --> 02:05:26,340
Keep everything as consistent as it can possibly be is sort of our goal here.

1192
02:05:30,013 --> 02:05:31,934
pull up some pictures of the location.

1193
02:05:33,495 --> 02:05:34,835
That's the facade of the building.

1194
02:05:34,855 --> 02:05:43,520
That's the street view.

1195
02:05:43,560 --> 02:05:46,361
We've got blinders on the fence there.

1196
02:05:46,401 --> 02:05:47,562
That's where the parking lot is.

1197
02:05:50,924 --> 02:05:52,885
All the parking would be restricted to that area.

1198
02:05:57,469 --> 02:06:01,332
two bay doors overnight if we do have customers in the area.

1199
02:06:02,874 --> 02:06:06,817
It's rare, but we would be parking those cars inside, so nothing would be stacked.

1200
02:06:08,138 --> 02:06:09,419
That's the inside of the building.

1201
02:06:10,600 --> 02:06:18,748
The goal here is just to put one divider wall right here, lower the sprinklers so we're up to code.

1202
02:06:19,328 --> 02:06:22,511
And this is just to have a safe place for customers to come into the entrance and

1203
02:06:25,652 --> 02:06:27,833
do their thing while while their cars are being serviced.

1204
02:06:28,133 --> 02:06:28,593
And that's it.

1205
02:06:29,054 --> 02:06:30,594
That's, that's all we plan on doing.

1206
02:06:31,035 --> 02:06:36,317
Just move into an existing building, have a clean shop, and keep it as consistent as possible.

1207
02:06:36,377 --> 02:06:38,718
There's no major plans here.

1208
02:06:39,679 --> 02:06:48,503
We, you know, we run a clean facility, a quiet facility, the only tool that we have is a single air compressor that that we run inside the shop.

1209
02:06:48,623 --> 02:06:51,424
So as far as presentations, that's all I got.

1210
02:06:52,423 --> 02:06:53,784
No, I appreciate it.

1211
02:06:53,864 --> 02:06:56,285
I do have a follow-up question though.

1212
02:06:56,325 --> 02:06:57,946
Can you go back to the actual fence?

1213
02:06:57,966 --> 02:07:00,027
You said that there's no cars left overnight.

1214
02:07:01,608 --> 02:07:02,068
Sorry.

1215
02:07:05,710 --> 02:07:08,052
But how is the work shielded from the right?

1216
02:07:08,132 --> 02:07:17,477
I know it's an industrial area, but to kind of clean up the property, how to keep it neat in that area, how are the cars shielded from outside view?

1217
02:07:19,302 --> 02:07:23,525
So the cars will not be worked on unless they're inside of that garage.

1218
02:07:24,926 --> 02:07:27,268
So a customer will pull in here, right?

1219
02:07:27,528 --> 02:07:29,309
They'll walk into the front of the building.

1220
02:07:30,430 --> 02:07:34,252
They'll talk to the customer service person at that counter.

1221
02:07:34,653 --> 02:07:35,533
They may have an appointment.

1222
02:07:35,553 --> 02:07:35,993
They may not.

1223
02:07:37,174 --> 02:07:39,476
Whatever, that person will instruct them what to do.

1224
02:07:41,097 --> 02:07:42,978
And then when their car is ready, they'll pull it into the garage.

1225
02:07:43,038 --> 02:07:43,759
The bay will go down.

1226
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:46,200
They'll replace the windshield.

1227
02:07:46,961 --> 02:07:47,902
And that person will leave.

1228
02:07:49,488 --> 02:07:53,290
Do you have anything kind of more specific to share on that?

1229
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:56,631
Yeah, I don't deal with the operation.

1230
02:07:56,671 --> 02:07:57,712
My name is Daniel Bean.

1231
02:07:57,732 --> 02:08:03,794
I'm the regional director of operations for the Northeast, been in the industry my entire life.

1232
02:08:05,055 --> 02:08:09,377
We are, as far as auto repair, we are

1233
02:08:10,460 --> 02:08:12,080
extremely low impact.

1234
02:08:12,721 --> 02:08:17,102
There's very limited chemical use.

1235
02:08:18,182 --> 02:08:21,843
There's no, there's nothing other than replacement of glass.

1236
02:08:23,324 --> 02:08:27,725
This facility for us will initially start out with

1237
02:08:28,625 --> 02:08:32,426
a manager, a CSR, and one technician.

1238
02:08:32,766 --> 02:08:35,927
That's how we start all our locations.

1239
02:08:36,367 --> 02:08:40,188
I don't see this location growing past three or four technicians.

1240
02:08:41,008 --> 02:08:43,329
We are about 80% mobile.

1241
02:08:44,369 --> 02:08:51,591
So the impact is early in the day, technicians come in, load up, and usually go out on the road.

1242
02:08:53,985 --> 02:08:58,930
We typically do not have cars, to Tim's point, left overnight.

1243
02:08:59,391 --> 02:09:01,473
And if they are, they're left inside the building.

1244
02:09:02,054 --> 02:09:04,176
Most installations take about an hour.

1245
02:09:04,897 --> 02:09:06,619
So it's kind of an in and out.

1246
02:09:08,421 --> 02:09:13,506
Like I said, there's not a lot of, I don't see it much negative impact.

1247
02:09:14,632 --> 02:09:24,648
to the neighborhood, there's not vehicles left disassembled or out in the parking lot.

1248
02:09:24,688 --> 02:09:29,115
Like Tim said, the customers come, they're typically out of there an hour or two.

1249
02:09:33,317 --> 02:09:34,137
Thank you.

1250
02:09:34,157 --> 02:09:39,839
My biggest concern was that it was a surface parking lot, but I didn't hear what you said.

1251
02:09:40,739 --> 02:09:46,421
The surface parking lot was just overhead and I wasn't sure how the cars were going to be kept.

1252
02:09:48,141 --> 02:09:53,943
And you've already clarified that they were not kept overnight and that they would be inside of the building.

1253
02:09:53,963 --> 02:09:56,444
So I was just trying to figure out exactly what that looked like.

1254
02:10:00,037 --> 02:10:01,398
that I appreciate the follow up.

1255
02:10:01,879 --> 02:10:06,282
I'm going to actually open it up to the board for further questions.

1256
02:10:13,329 --> 02:10:14,249
Vice Chair Hedeman.

1257
02:10:16,511 --> 02:10:17,592
Thanks Chair McPherson.

1258
02:10:19,294 --> 02:10:21,155
Thank you so much for your presentation.

1259
02:10:21,175 --> 02:10:23,658
My heart goes out to you with, you know,

1260
02:10:24,634 --> 02:10:26,115
the red tape that you had to deal with.

1261
02:10:26,335 --> 02:10:30,358
I really appreciate your patience and your positive attitude on this call.

1262
02:10:30,378 --> 02:10:31,679
I have a few questions.

1263
02:10:33,021 --> 02:10:45,010
First one is, how many surface parking spots are you planning for this site?

1264
02:10:46,451 --> 02:10:50,314
We really have no minimum or maximum.

1265
02:10:50,334 --> 02:10:52,796
It's based on whatever property that we can work with.

1266
02:10:52,816 --> 02:10:54,117
How many cars can fit on this site?

1267
02:10:56,462 --> 02:10:58,963
When I was in there with my trucks, I had 12.

1268
02:10:59,163 --> 02:11:00,563
Okay.

1269
02:11:01,003 --> 02:11:01,243
Yeah.

1270
02:11:01,303 --> 02:11:03,384
That's like tandem, I'm assuming.

1271
02:11:03,864 --> 02:11:04,664
Yeah, exactly.

1272
02:11:04,684 --> 02:11:05,124
Okay.

1273
02:11:05,444 --> 02:11:13,106
The only reason I ask is because your wall fan site has seven parking spots plus one accessible spot.

1274
02:11:13,726 --> 02:11:25,509
I'm assuming if you're going to do similar business on this site, just make sure that you guys have those seven or however many spots clearly marked

1275
02:11:26,495 --> 02:11:33,517
And then the other question I had was for Mr. Genucci, what's the lease term?

1276
02:11:33,537 --> 02:11:35,857
The lease term is five years.

1277
02:11:36,518 --> 02:11:37,818
Okay.

1278
02:11:37,838 --> 02:11:38,678
So it's really good to know.

1279
02:11:39,238 --> 02:11:45,040
The reason I ask is because this site is so close to two MBTA stops.

1280
02:11:48,201 --> 02:11:53,782
I ran a quick Google Maps search and it's an eight minute walk.

1281
02:11:55,546 --> 02:12:00,732
0.3 miles to one of the green line stops, easily in back bay in 35 minutes.

1282
02:12:01,933 --> 02:12:12,726
So, you know, from one perspective, this is great for autogloss now because somebody could theoretically drop off their car, hop on the T, go to work, come back, pick up their car.

1283
02:12:12,746 --> 02:12:13,767
But I'd

1284
02:12:14,868 --> 02:12:24,153
I encourage Mr. Tanushi to also think of, you know, maybe some creative uses in the future for this site, you know, going beyond, you know, industrial.

1285
02:12:24,173 --> 02:12:28,035
You know, this could be a really cool site, a really cool location.

1286
02:12:29,375 --> 02:12:31,876
Yeah, we do have a long-term

1287
02:12:33,578 --> 02:12:59,965
larger plan i have a couple of i have a couple of good plans to present separately at a different time of a couple of small pieces of property in that zone that could probably you know be limited parking three families probably two coming up but we can you know i'll bring that to the board separately as well yeah that's exciting to hear um but you know in the meantime i think this is a a

1288
02:13:00,923 --> 02:13:05,405
a smart use of an existing space with a limited impact that I support it.

1289
02:13:05,986 --> 02:13:28,877
And I would actually tear this question in terms of how much risk the applicant is willing to assume, because we can talk about this, we could put it to a motion, but if the applicant does not want to open themselves up to an appeal, then we should know that as a board.

1290
02:13:29,635 --> 02:13:31,715
or if you're comfortable with that, let us know.

1291
02:13:32,936 --> 02:13:34,376
I'm sorry, I didn't understand.

1292
02:13:34,556 --> 02:13:38,897
Was this to do with the fact that we didn't have the right address listed tonight?

1293
02:13:38,977 --> 02:13:39,697
Is that what that was?

1294
02:13:39,797 --> 02:13:40,617
I'm just trying to remember.

1295
02:13:40,817 --> 02:13:41,917
Correct.

1296
02:13:41,957 --> 02:13:44,398
So how does that change things for this?

1297
02:13:44,478 --> 02:13:50,359
I'll defer that to Danielle, because it sounds like she had a more succinct summary than I did.

1298
02:13:51,619 --> 02:13:55,300
Yeah, she let me know via email, but I'll take the rest, please.

1299
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:55,420
Yes.

1300
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,360
So as I mentioned,

1301
02:13:58,605 --> 02:14:08,813
All of the public hearing notice was accurate except for the agenda, which had a typo on it with the incorrect address.

1302
02:14:12,476 --> 02:14:19,622
So if somebody decided there was, I don't even know if just having standing or not,

1303
02:14:23,742 --> 02:14:36,085
if they would need to have standing or not, but if someone appealed the decision and they, it likely would get overturned for a procedural defect.

1304
02:14:36,753 --> 02:14:39,134
So can I put it into simple English?

1305
02:14:39,774 --> 02:14:53,760
The risk is, if somebody decides they didn't like what you're doing and they wanted to fight against it, they could tie you up in court for months.

1306
02:14:54,160 --> 02:15:02,023
Possibly like, we saw an appeal of the zoning board took easily six or nine months in court.

1307
02:15:03,203 --> 02:15:04,204
for them to appeal it.

1308
02:15:06,684 --> 02:15:17,568
And it would come back to this board eventually, and then this board would approve it again, but it could delay it for months, months, maybe a year.

1309
02:15:17,968 --> 02:15:26,811
The alternative is if you brought it back, there's another meeting in two weeks, it would go properly on the agenda and the board votes in two weeks.

1310
02:15:27,231 --> 02:15:31,893
There is practically like they couldn't appeal it on those grounds.

1311
02:15:33,010 --> 02:15:37,652
And they win their case that we did it wrong, because the agenda was messed up.

1312
02:15:38,333 --> 02:15:38,713
Right.

1313
02:15:39,333 --> 02:15:39,653
Right.

1314
02:15:39,894 --> 02:15:46,037
Yeah, our hope would be that most of the most of the logistics would be covered on this call.

1315
02:15:46,077 --> 02:15:54,241
And then during the next call, we could just, you know, make it official, basically, you know, with with the proper address and all those things.

1316
02:15:55,121 --> 02:15:57,262
At that point, if that makes sense.

1317
02:15:57,723 --> 02:16:00,084
And as I had mentioned, in my email that

1318
02:16:00,823 --> 02:16:05,186
um, we can make sure to turn around and file the decision.

1319
02:16:06,166 --> 02:16:09,408
Like the next day, like I can commit to that.

1320
02:16:09,668 --> 02:16:12,550
We generally have your 14 days.

1321
02:16:13,931 --> 02:16:15,592
So you won't lose any time.

1322
02:16:15,612 --> 02:16:16,973
Okay.

1323
02:16:17,593 --> 02:16:24,357
Is this, this was not, and I kind of piled on some of the other kind of bad luck that you've had.

1324
02:16:25,327 --> 02:16:25,888
That's okay.

1325
02:16:25,948 --> 02:16:29,571
I wouldn't want to tell you all about all of the mistakes that I've made this week.

1326
02:16:29,651 --> 02:16:52,211
So, um, as long as I can, you know, if, if, if we can sort of set a tentative date for, you know, the, the week following the next meeting to, to, to plan for, um, you know, painting the building and putting the signage up pending that, um, you know, getting through the proper inspections, that would be extremely helpful.

1327
02:16:55,212 --> 02:17:03,374
Yeah, no, I think we have to, we have to take the two weeks and, and yeah, so when we get back here, do we

1328
02:17:04,486 --> 02:17:31,751
have another meeting or is this kind of do we get all our questions out tonight other than obviously public comment if we have to open it up again to public comment we're going to do public comment this evening and if there's any public comment that comes in it would be susceptible to open it up again um based on that technicality so we're literally just getting everything out tonight including um the fact that we open up the public hearing we'll give you conditions um if and see how the board wants to vote and

1329
02:17:33,069 --> 02:17:35,091
Again, you're just showing up at the next meeting.

1330
02:17:35,791 --> 02:17:37,252
Okay, great.

1331
02:17:37,272 --> 02:17:40,195
Can we go first to the next meeting?

1332
02:17:41,916 --> 02:17:42,296
Thank you.

1333
02:17:43,678 --> 02:17:44,658
Vice chair.

1334
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:48,181
Thank you.

1335
02:17:48,201 --> 02:18:01,552
The only thing I would like to say, um, you know, for the next meeting is those, uh, parking spaces, at least kind of striped, at least on a conceptual basis in that back lot, just to confirm that there is enough space

1336
02:18:03,013 --> 02:18:06,916
you know, for the work that Autoglass now wants to do.

1337
02:18:06,936 --> 02:18:08,537
But that's really all I would want to see.

1338
02:18:08,557 --> 02:18:11,178
That's easy.

1339
02:18:11,658 --> 02:18:16,181
There was some feedback on, I know you were amenable to putting up some signs.

1340
02:18:16,201 --> 02:18:25,586
You spoke about signs and then the condition of the barbed wire that the city did not particularly care for.

1341
02:18:26,147 --> 02:18:27,868
Are you amenable to that, Mrs. Nucci?

1342
02:18:28,268 --> 02:18:29,889
Yeah, that's very fair.

1343
02:18:29,929 --> 02:18:31,670
We can lose that very quickly.

1344
02:18:33,037 --> 02:18:44,064
And then when, of course the city has, if you, when you apply for the sign permit, you have to submit the plans to the planning staff for that going forward, but we'll spell that condition out.

1345
02:18:44,105 --> 02:18:47,387
We'll have the city spell that condition out before the board makes a decision.

1346
02:18:48,387 --> 02:18:48,588
Right.

1347
02:18:48,628 --> 02:18:58,074
And I think our, our, our sign vendors are already in the works for that and make sure that they've got all their, you know, T's crossed and I started.

1348
02:19:00,205 --> 02:19:02,907
I would like to skip steps.

1349
02:19:04,788 --> 02:19:06,209
And I, we appreciate that.

1350
02:19:06,229 --> 02:19:12,494
And again, that's why we're even, um, making sure that we're dotting our I's and crossing our T's for tonight's technicality.

1351
02:19:12,714 --> 02:19:18,618
Um, tiny little inconvenience, but, um, it'll be sealed for later.

1352
02:19:19,078 --> 02:19:24,522
I'm going to open up the public comment now, uh, period, just in case there's anyone that wants to speak.

1353
02:19:25,430 --> 02:19:29,534
Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Danielle in the comments.

1354
02:19:29,554 --> 02:19:33,297
You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

1356
02:19:36,880 --> 02:19:43,666
A reminder to all meeting participants to please refrain from using the chat function to provide comments as it is not part of the public record.

1357
02:19:44,186 --> 02:19:50,572

1358
02:19:51,738 --> 02:20:01,866
Daniel, can you please check the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters regarding this item?

1359
02:20:05,229 --> 02:20:05,529
Hello?

1360
02:20:07,451 --> 02:20:07,751
Hi.

1361
02:20:08,712 --> 02:20:11,194
Yes, I'm just chiming in.

1362
02:20:11,935 --> 02:20:13,016
This is Joseph Anoletto.

1363
02:20:13,116 --> 02:20:16,859
I'm the owner of Titan Gas and Cowash on the other side of the tracks.

1364
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:20,602
I'm Darren's butter, and I have no objections to the

1365
02:20:21,850 --> 02:20:26,031
proposed business going into his garage.

1366
02:20:27,392 --> 02:20:32,953
Darren has been an upstanding business owner and a great asset to the community.

1367
02:20:33,654 --> 02:20:38,775
I've known him for quite a while and I think he has nothing but good intentions for the area going forward.

1368
02:20:38,815 --> 02:20:47,798
So I'd just like to leave it at that and just give some words of support to Darren and I wish them all the best of luck over there.

1369
02:20:48,823 --> 02:20:49,704
We appreciate it.

1370
02:20:49,724 --> 02:20:53,147
Can you just, can you say your name again and give us the address of Titan?

1371
02:20:53,888 --> 02:20:59,793
Oh, uh, this is Joseph Aniletto and I'm calling from a five 90 Boston Avenue.

1372
02:21:00,754 --> 02:21:01,875
Thank you.

1373
02:21:01,915 --> 02:21:02,656
We appreciate it.

1374
02:21:03,476 --> 02:21:03,817
Thank you.

1375
02:21:05,959 --> 02:21:06,299
Good luck.

1376
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:07,420
Thanks man.

1377
02:21:09,282 --> 02:21:09,442
Yeah.

1378
02:21:09,482 --> 02:21:09,802
Thank you.

1379
02:21:11,984 --> 02:21:12,545
Madam chair.

1380
02:21:12,565 --> 02:21:13,986
I don't see any other, um,

1381
02:21:17,339 --> 02:21:19,940
folks who are on this call that raised hand.

1382
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:25,243
I didn't receive any written comments regarding this matter.

1383
02:21:28,024 --> 02:21:44,072
Okay, so I'm gonna close the public comment period for the meeting for this item and go back to the board for deliberation and discuss the approval for a special permit and if there's any potential conditions for approval.

1384
02:21:45,663 --> 02:21:50,685
And we can have Danielle spell those conditions out, if any.

1385
02:21:50,705 --> 02:22:01,889
Just to give you an idea of where I sit myself, and then the board can actually all speak, is I actually wanted to make sure that there were no adverse effects, there was no benefits as opposed to adverse effects.

1386
02:22:03,670 --> 02:22:12,493
I will be absolutely transparent with you and let you know that I'm not entirely sure that it's the highest and best use, but there are definitely benefits to

1387
02:22:13,165 --> 02:22:23,351
the use at this point, especially with your property being vacant for over a year.

1388
02:22:23,391 --> 02:22:26,873
So I think that there's no negative benefits.

1389
02:22:26,913 --> 02:22:28,413
If anything, it'll be all positive.

1390
02:22:28,794 --> 02:22:33,796
And saying that, I will actually be more in favor of this project going forward at this point.

1391
02:22:35,257 --> 02:22:38,579
So I will turn it over to see if the board has anything else to add.

1392
02:22:47,654 --> 02:22:48,595
Vice Chair Hederman.

1393
02:22:50,836 --> 02:22:51,897
I echo your sentiments.

1394
02:22:52,558 --> 02:22:56,881
I would be in support of this project at this time.

1395
02:22:56,981 --> 02:23:01,284
We're putting together conditions and then continuing to date certain

1396
02:23:02,848 --> 02:23:04,630
Jen, that's what we're doing, right?

1397
02:23:05,330 --> 02:23:05,771
Yes.

1398
02:23:06,151 --> 02:23:06,431
Okay.

1399
02:23:06,672 --> 02:23:19,944
Which is based on a technicality, so pretty much we'll get our tentative approval this evening with conditions, and they will come back to have us vote officially on a date certain.

1400
02:23:22,106 --> 02:23:23,467
Are we got that, Average Fishman?

1401
02:23:25,744 --> 02:23:26,204
Thank you.

1402
02:23:26,865 --> 02:23:41,397
I similarly kind of came in knowing that city council is hoping to, that this area will transition its use, but I think that seems like there's going to be very few negative effects of this.

1403
02:23:41,417 --> 02:23:47,702
It's, uh, and, uh, you guys got caught in a bad situation with the timing.

1404
02:23:47,802 --> 02:23:49,763
I, I feel okay moving forward with this.

1405
02:23:52,786 --> 02:23:53,046
Thanks.

1406
02:23:57,990 --> 02:23:59,532
So we do have a couple of conditions.

1407
02:23:59,572 --> 02:24:04,816
Danielle, do you want to summarize those for us?

1408
02:24:06,097 --> 02:24:06,357
Yes.

1409
02:24:06,417 --> 02:24:13,803
So my recommended conditions, and I spoke to Mr. DiNucci about these, was...

1410
02:24:21,500 --> 02:24:28,683
The condition one would be to remove the barbed wire on the fence and maintain screening on the fence to ensure parking is not visible from the public way.

1411
02:24:29,883 --> 02:24:33,224
Right now there are those final kind of like strips that are woven in.

1412
02:24:33,244 --> 02:24:42,748
I just want to make sure that that's maintained, or replace the fence down the road that it's a solid fence that screens the parking.

1413
02:24:44,353 --> 02:24:51,598
And then condition two would be prior to applying for a sign permit, the applicant must submit plans, planning staff review approval.

1414
02:24:52,919 --> 02:24:59,223
Preferred sign types would be like downcast lighting, such as gooseneck or halo lit channel letters.

1415
02:25:00,664 --> 02:25:02,665
No internally lit box signs.

1416
02:25:04,787 --> 02:25:08,549
We just want to kind of elevate the facade a little bit.

1417
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:10,611
Yeah, classy look.

1418
02:25:11,731 --> 02:25:11,992
Okay.

1419
02:25:13,221 --> 02:25:13,721
That's helpful.

1420
02:25:13,741 --> 02:25:14,101
Thank you.

1421
02:25:15,702 --> 02:25:21,805
And just Vice Chair Hedeman had mentioned striped parking for the commission.

1422
02:25:22,065 --> 02:25:24,606
Vice Chair Hedeman, do you want to speak or?

1423
02:25:24,626 --> 02:25:32,329
Yeah, just some idea of where the cars are going to go in the back.

1424
02:25:33,389 --> 02:25:37,531
And I did have a suggestion for an additional potential condition.

1425
02:25:38,011 --> 02:25:39,892
I'm not sure if it's within our scope.

1426
02:25:40,132 --> 02:25:42,173
I'm curious to see what the city would say.

1427
02:25:43,185 --> 02:25:56,533
Um, but the potential condition that I would propose is that, um, uh, the applicant needs to come back before this board, um, prior to lease renewal.

1428
02:25:57,174 --> 02:26:00,516
So in five years, I don't even know if we can condition that.

1429
02:26:01,336 --> 02:26:01,737
We can.

1430
02:26:02,437 --> 02:26:02,677
Okay.

1431
02:26:03,378 --> 02:26:04,298
I would propose that.

1432
02:26:04,839 --> 02:26:10,002
And we, that's the way, you know, we can give a lot of us now some, you know, security in their lease term.

1433
02:26:10,772 --> 02:26:23,160
but also potentially revisit the use of this site in the long term, but not impact Mr. DiNucci's tenancy or business as a landlord.

1434
02:26:23,180 --> 02:26:33,526
I don't know if anybody else on the board has thoughts about that.

1435
02:26:38,930 --> 02:26:39,370
I like it.

1436
02:26:40,022 --> 02:26:47,986
Yeah, I would that would be very helpful, especially with the direction of the city's comprehensive plan for the use of the South that South method area.

1437
02:26:49,147 --> 02:26:53,549
It would it would give us a little more idea of what better fits there if.

1438
02:26:56,131 --> 02:26:58,272
That use is not compatible.

1439
02:27:01,173 --> 02:27:01,233
Mr

1440
02:27:10,826 --> 02:27:11,526
put in there.

1441
02:27:14,607 --> 02:27:24,051
So if we want to renew, we have to get permission from the city to renew in case they want to move in a different direction.

1442
02:27:26,032 --> 02:27:27,212
Is that the clarification?

1443
02:27:28,713 --> 02:27:32,274
Because it's still a special permit, you're being, you're a least

1444
02:27:34,592 --> 02:27:36,793
Your use is considered a leased use.

1445
02:27:37,293 --> 02:27:57,444
So before that lease can be renewed, you would have to come back before our board for another special permit before the landlord can actually just allow you another lease just to make sure that it's complying again with the city's use for that area.

1446
02:27:58,584 --> 02:28:03,307
We have a comprehensive plan, a vision for that area and

1447
02:28:03,873 --> 02:28:07,856
As of right now, although it's industrial, it's not by right.

1448
02:28:09,037 --> 02:28:13,840
So we're giving you a special permit because it goes against the uses that the city has moved forward with.

1449
02:28:14,741 --> 02:28:25,189
So in order to continuously allow a use that's not compatible with the area, we need to make sure that there is more benefits than adverse effects, if that makes sense.

1450
02:28:25,889 --> 02:28:26,930
Yes, it does, thank you.

1451
02:28:32,298 --> 02:28:33,959
Alicia, did you want to add to that?

1452
02:28:40,482 --> 02:28:41,842
I was honest.

1453
02:28:41,903 --> 02:28:46,785
I was messaging Daniel in the background because I'm not sure.

1454
02:28:46,805 --> 02:28:51,527
We might want to check with legal.

1455
02:28:51,567 --> 02:28:56,169
I'm not sure that we can condition his lease renewal on another approval through us.

1456
02:28:57,450 --> 02:29:00,791
We could, however, check that the conditions were met.

1457
02:29:04,970 --> 02:29:14,414
Normally, when this board issues conditions, it's about construction, and then there's an occupancy permit and before the occupancy permit is issued.

1458
02:29:15,374 --> 02:29:16,235
Danielle or I make

1459
02:29:17,539 --> 02:29:21,201
sure that the conditions have been met, right, that we told them to do this, we make sure they do it.

1460
02:29:21,741 --> 02:29:29,005
And that holding the occupancy permit is the what kind of is our power to make sure that they do it.

1461
02:29:30,046 --> 02:29:30,326
Right.

1462
02:29:30,426 --> 02:29:34,648
So we could check with legal if we can condition a lease renewal on it.

1463
02:29:35,169 --> 02:29:41,412
But we could like say I think the example would be we say take down the barbed wire.

1464
02:29:41,732 --> 02:29:43,453
I know you've agreed that you're going to do that.

1465
02:29:43,513 --> 02:29:44,374
You're not arguing it.

1466
02:29:44,674 --> 02:29:46,255
But say you didn't do it.

1467
02:29:46,935 --> 02:29:51,460
then we could actually say we're going to revoke the special permit.

1468
02:29:51,660 --> 02:29:53,722
That's what I think we were thinking, right?

1469
02:29:53,782 --> 02:29:57,346
Like that they didn't do it.

1470
02:29:58,187 --> 02:30:07,157
But we might check with our legal about what we're allowed to do around lease renewals, because that's something we've never dealt with in Medford.

1471
02:30:08,007 --> 02:30:15,849
Because we could definitely revisit it and see if the screening of the parking is sufficient or if it's causing problems.

1472
02:30:18,230 --> 02:30:27,732
If work is spilling into the lot, if there's certain things that we could revisit.

1473
02:30:27,752 --> 02:30:30,053
But yeah, I do want to check with legal.

1474
02:30:33,292 --> 02:30:43,634
Yeah, just we're trying to provide the city with some safeguards on how, like if there were adverse effects that outweigh the benefits going forward, how do we revisit that?

1475
02:30:43,674 --> 02:30:53,016
And I'm not, again, in lieu of having a city solicitor here, I'm not sure how to move forward with that condition either.

1476
02:30:53,116 --> 02:30:58,017
So I'm not, I guess we wouldn't condition it this evening if the city's not comfortable with it.

1477
02:30:59,458 --> 02:31:01,618
We can have these answers in two weeks.

1478
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:11,245
Okay, yeah, so we'll take we'll table that for now, but keep it in if the city can actually report back on that that would be helpful.

1479
02:31:13,466 --> 02:31:14,266
Vice chair Edelman?

1480
02:31:15,427 --> 02:31:24,993
Yeah, I just want to clarify I'm not really worried at all about the applicant or the tenant, you know, not following their conditions.

1481
02:31:26,234 --> 02:31:28,095
It's really just, you know, to give

1482
02:31:28,857 --> 02:31:38,543
an opportunity to like revisit, you know, is this the highest and best use, you know, does it help with neighborhood character, you know, for the specific site.

1483
02:31:38,624 --> 02:31:46,189
So I'm fine dropping it because I don't want to do anything that's not within our scope.

1484
02:31:47,029 --> 02:31:49,311
But yeah, I would definitely be interested in the-

1485
02:31:53,464 --> 02:32:07,092
absolutely clear that it was given the city a safeguard, but at the same time, I'm more invested in the comprehensive plan for the use of that area, especially having been on the comprehensive board steering committee.

1486
02:32:08,673 --> 02:32:09,334
Peter Cowles?

1487
02:32:11,675 --> 02:32:22,762
I was just going to kind of echo the beginning of what Emily said and some of what Danielle said, that we have to bring this back in two weeks.

1488
02:32:23,701 --> 02:32:28,264
Anyway, because of the technicality, we can have that figured out for the next meeting.

1489
02:32:28,284 --> 02:32:33,607
Yeah, no, definitely.

1490
02:32:33,687 --> 02:32:34,587
We definitely will.

1491
02:32:35,147 --> 02:32:36,948
I wanted to just make sure that I got everyone.

1492
02:32:37,409 --> 02:32:40,931
And then I have Mr. Bean, you have something to add?

1493
02:32:42,131 --> 02:32:44,353
Yeah, just a concern.

1494
02:32:44,633 --> 02:32:52,097
So I understand the condition for release.

1495
02:32:53,320 --> 02:33:04,704
if it concerns whether we've upheld our end of, let's say just for lack of a better term, the deal in method conditions.

1496
02:33:04,804 --> 02:33:16,548
My concern is that it's been stated that it was a condition to see if that was still the vision for that neighborhood.

1497
02:33:17,790 --> 02:33:19,531
I mean, we're not- We can tell you it's not.

1498
02:33:20,212 --> 02:33:21,713
It's not the vision of the neighborhood.

1499
02:33:21,993 --> 02:33:31,580
Okay, so my concern is we're, I mean, we're not looking to open up a facility for five years and then leave.

1500
02:33:34,202 --> 02:33:40,908
I mean, we open facilities to keep them open as long as the company's around.

1501
02:33:41,728 --> 02:33:42,489
Does that make sense?

1502
02:33:45,637 --> 02:33:52,743
So is the condition to look at it and go, okay, the city wants to move in a completely different direction in five years.

1503
02:33:53,483 --> 02:34:05,032
And that condition would mean that they wouldn't want to renew the lease just on the fact that they don't want an auto glass shop in that neighborhood at that point.

1504
02:34:05,052 --> 02:34:08,155
Or am I not understanding what you're saying?

1505
02:34:21,861 --> 02:34:37,536
So to reiterate what Daniel has already said, as of right now, the reason why you need a special permit is an auto glass shop is not the highest and best use for that area as per our comprehensive plan.

1506
02:34:38,036 --> 02:34:46,424
However, because we found that there's more benefits than adverse effects as of today's date, the board has decided to allow it to go forward.

1507
02:34:48,304 --> 02:34:53,486
But we are trying to figure out in five years, will that continue to be the case?

1508
02:34:54,807 --> 02:35:00,189
So the best way to explain this is it's not the city's vision for that area.

1509
02:35:00,829 --> 02:35:12,594
And I'm not sure that they would want to continuously allow that use in that area, especially after putting so much time and energy into zoning recodification and zoning amendments.

1510
02:35:14,109 --> 02:35:21,151
I'm pretty sure that we don't have the authority, though, to say to somebody, you have to stop an existing use.

1511
02:35:21,411 --> 02:35:27,113
Once they have a special permit, they probably couldn't sell to a different auto glass shop.

1512
02:35:28,274 --> 02:35:35,136
But I don't think that we have the authority to, once they're there and established, to tell them they have to stop.

1513
02:35:38,115 --> 02:35:39,516
We need to check with legal.

1514
02:35:39,536 --> 02:35:47,121
I've heard of like sunset provisions for things and we just need to, I don't think we're going to get this question answered tonight.

1515
02:35:47,141 --> 02:36:02,450
No, and so just to, I want to make sure because now you have the tenant that's, and I understand, I would be the same way that you would continue to go forward.

1516
02:36:02,651 --> 02:36:06,333
And so if this is something that does not need to be on the table, we can take it off.

1517
02:36:07,305 --> 02:36:09,247
if it's not even something within our purview.

1518
02:36:11,649 --> 02:36:27,902
I would appreciate that because it's very tough to hear this, you know, to buy a building and to, you know, to do the right things and be a good community tenant and to have someone kind of, you know, make your financial future decisions on your property.

1519
02:36:27,922 --> 02:36:30,504
It almost leans towards like eminent domain.

1520
02:36:30,564 --> 02:36:33,326
It feels, it almost feels really bad.

1521
02:36:35,493 --> 02:36:40,977
So I would, I would appreciate it if you took it off the table and you know, I like what Alicia said.

1522
02:36:41,017 --> 02:36:42,658
I kind of feel the same.

1523
02:36:42,718 --> 02:36:46,021
I feel like, you know, I understand the conditions.

1524
02:36:46,221 --> 02:36:47,042
Absolutely.

1525
02:36:47,682 --> 02:36:51,365
Um, we need them just like we need, uh, tenant condition statements.

1526
02:36:51,465 --> 02:36:54,727
And if they start to not do their part, we ask them to leave.

1527
02:36:54,787 --> 02:36:58,770
If we don't take the ball buyer and stripe and become a good neighbor, right.

1528
02:36:58,850 --> 02:36:59,791
You ask us to leave.

1529
02:36:59,851 --> 02:37:01,052
I understand the conditions.

1530
02:37:01,573 --> 02:37:02,653
That makes perfect sense.

1531
02:37:02,733 --> 02:37:03,274
But, um,

1532
02:37:04,219 --> 02:37:06,681
I would like to keep it at the conditions if we could.

1533
02:37:09,804 --> 02:37:10,665
Vice Chair Hetherman?

1534
02:37:12,566 --> 02:37:14,488
Yeah, I'm kind of taking this off the table.

1535
02:37:14,508 --> 02:37:17,450
I'm curious to see if other board members are.

1536
02:37:17,810 --> 02:37:20,373
The classic thing, bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

1537
02:37:21,954 --> 02:37:26,558
You have a great tenant in front of you that's willing to occupy the site.

1538
02:37:26,918 --> 02:37:29,320
It's going to add jobs, it's going to add

1539
02:37:29,767 --> 02:37:31,048
you know, doing time activity.

1540
02:37:31,068 --> 02:37:35,750
You know, I checked out their Wealthium location just on Google Maps.

1541
02:37:35,790 --> 02:37:36,410
It looks clean.

1542
02:37:36,590 --> 02:37:37,531
It looks professional.

1543
02:37:38,371 --> 02:37:39,872
So I'm fine taking that off the table.

1544
02:37:41,312 --> 02:37:41,693
Thank you.

1545
02:37:42,813 --> 02:37:43,413
Peter Cowles?

1546
02:37:45,374 --> 02:37:47,395
I just want to echo Emily's.

1547
02:37:47,415 --> 02:37:50,257
I'm also at this time kind of taking it off the table.

1548
02:37:50,317 --> 02:37:57,100
I don't, I kind of don't see a way in which that,

1549
02:37:57,502 --> 02:37:59,324
fits within our purview at this time.

1550
02:37:59,664 --> 02:38:10,474
And I also don't think that belaboring the point for five years from now when there may be a totally different need in the neighborhood, especially given the push of the comprehensive plan.

1551
02:38:10,794 --> 02:38:15,559
But to make the decision now for five years down the road isn't something that we necessarily need to do.

1552
02:38:20,280 --> 02:38:27,322
And I'm willing to take it, definitely, as we've already said, we've already talked about what the conditions were and how we felt.

1553
02:38:27,482 --> 02:38:36,925
And so we'll just leave it at a provisional approval pending the applicant coming back before us at 8th of April 3rd.

1554
02:38:37,686 --> 02:38:44,348
And we'll, with those, the three conditions that we will maintain is to remove the barbed wire on the fence,

1555
02:38:45,395 --> 02:38:50,538
prior to applying for a sign permit, the applicant must submit plans to the planning staff, and then the strike parking.

1556
02:38:50,698 --> 02:38:59,323
We'll leave it at those three conditions and not entertain anything else as far as changes of police use, that would be up to the landlord.

1557
02:39:01,845 --> 02:39:12,351
I will look for, in leaving it there, I will look for a motion to continue this to April 3rd, 2024.

1558
02:39:17,033 --> 02:39:17,513
Uh, so much.

1559
02:39:17,553 --> 02:39:23,094
Sounds like you had a second.

1560
02:39:24,895 --> 02:39:26,075
I will motion for second.

1561
02:39:26,735 --> 02:39:27,615
Okay, yeah, you can.

1562
02:39:29,256 --> 02:39:33,116
I'll motion to continue to a date certain April 3rd.

1563
02:39:34,217 --> 02:39:34,877
April 3rd.

1564
02:39:35,997 --> 02:39:37,777
And I'll second.

1565
02:39:40,318 --> 02:39:41,518
Vice Chair Emily Hederman.

1566
02:39:42,038 --> 02:39:42,158
Aye.

1567
02:39:42,798 --> 02:39:43,458
Peter Cowles.

1568
02:39:44,319 --> 02:39:44,419
Aye.

1569
02:39:45,079 --> 02:39:45,699
Ari Fischman.

1570
02:39:46,851 --> 02:39:46,971
Aye.

1571
02:39:47,571 --> 02:39:48,491
Pam Mariansky.

1572
02:39:49,212 --> 02:39:49,312
Aye.

1573
02:39:49,912 --> 02:39:51,932
And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.

1574
02:39:52,392 --> 02:39:53,453
Thank you, Mr. DiNucci.

1575
02:39:53,493 --> 02:39:54,233
Thank you, Mr. Bain.

1576
02:39:54,253 --> 02:39:55,613
Thank you, Mr. Hohner.

1577
02:39:55,853 --> 02:39:58,914
I'm sorry if I'm saying your name incorrectly.

1578
02:39:58,954 --> 02:39:59,654
That's okay.

1579
02:39:59,694 --> 02:40:00,774
No, it's fine.

1580
02:40:00,814 --> 02:40:04,335
It's not very straightforward, but I appreciate it.

1581
02:40:04,435 --> 02:40:11,097
I just wanted to say thank you to all of you, especially Alicia and Danielle.

1582
02:40:11,317 --> 02:40:14,197
Y'all have been very patient with us and I appreciate all of your help.

1583
02:40:14,878 --> 02:40:16,238
It's much appreciated.

1584
02:40:17,744 --> 02:40:18,444
Thank you, everybody.

1585
02:40:18,464 --> 02:40:20,225
Thank you, everyone.

1586
02:40:20,585 --> 02:40:21,665
We'll see you in two weeks.

1587
02:40:22,086 --> 02:40:24,706
See you in April.

1588
02:40:24,746 --> 02:40:25,167
Thank you.

1589
02:40:25,187 --> 02:40:26,127
Good night.

1590
02:40:28,088 --> 02:40:28,368
Thanks.

1591
02:40:31,309 --> 02:40:34,610
And so the next item is approval of minutes.

1592
02:40:38,557 --> 02:40:48,905
And Alicia, I'm going to ask for a motion to move the zoning overhaul updates until our next meeting.

1593
02:40:51,963 --> 02:40:53,624
but we'll do the approval of minutes.

1594
02:40:53,644 --> 02:40:54,484
Maybe I'll turn to the next one.

1595
02:40:54,504 --> 02:40:56,865
We've got a lot going on at that one too.

1596
02:40:57,446 --> 02:41:09,131
Yeah, or an ongoing conversation so that we can definitely, because what the city is doing is actually providing us an opportunity to have these conversations with them before they just come with us and say, Hey, this is what we're doing.

1597
02:41:09,591 --> 02:41:10,472
What do you feel about it?

1598
02:41:10,512 --> 02:41:11,472
So they're bringing us in.

1599
02:41:11,492 --> 02:41:13,013
So I truly appreciate it.

1600
02:41:13,053 --> 02:41:16,695
But in saying that, I want to make sure that I have the time that permits

1601
02:41:17,175 --> 02:41:22,439
to give quality feedback and not just, you know, just get it like a checkbox and get it off.

1602
02:41:23,780 --> 02:41:24,020
So.

1603
02:41:25,481 --> 02:41:27,563
Madam Chair, if I might, I'll just remind.

1604
02:41:27,823 --> 02:41:37,250
So some of the every other week opposite these meetings at seven o'clock is the City Council Committee on Planning and Zoning.

1605
02:41:37,910 --> 02:41:41,733
And several of those meetings are going to be about the zoning overhaul.

1606
02:41:42,534 --> 02:41:45,156
If people want to watch them or participate in them,

1607
02:41:47,053 --> 02:41:47,834
You may do that.

1608
02:41:49,495 --> 02:41:55,781
And we will do our best to try and make sure you're aware of when they're happening and if there are specific topics at them.

1609
02:41:56,862 --> 02:41:59,004
So that you're aware as well.

1610
02:41:59,525 --> 02:42:02,888
If you want to discuss them as a board, you need to have it on your agenda.

1611
02:42:02,928 --> 02:42:08,673
But if you want to just provide input to the city council's meeting, you should be able to do that.

1612
02:42:08,693 --> 02:42:12,757
So we can provide counsel and that's not like violate any kind of

1613
02:42:13,925 --> 02:42:17,327
Well, I think we need to check and make sure there's not a quorum.

1614
02:42:18,167 --> 02:42:29,452
Um, well, if it's a public, if it's a publicly posted meeting of a public body, well, we'd have to, let me check with their, their, they'd have to be like a joint.

1615
02:42:30,493 --> 02:42:30,693
Yeah.

1616
02:42:30,713 --> 02:42:41,718
Cause if we, if we all, if it's not a joint meet and then we all signed in and have comments, that's, that's definitely a quorum, but you are not the decision-making body at that point.

1617
02:42:42,357 --> 02:42:45,859
They can't get together and talk about anything together.

1618
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:47,561
At a publicly posted meeting.

1619
02:42:49,322 --> 02:42:50,082
Of their meeting.

1620
02:42:50,523 --> 02:42:51,864
All right, let me check with legal.

1621
02:42:52,244 --> 02:42:52,464
Yeah.

1622
02:42:54,285 --> 02:42:58,108
And when are the meetings if the committee on zoning and planning windows usually held?

1623
02:42:59,249 --> 02:43:03,372
The second and fourth Wednesdays at seven o'clock.

1624
02:43:16,667 --> 02:43:18,849
Did you want to dispose of the minutes?

1625
02:43:19,690 --> 02:43:19,930
Yes.

1626
02:43:20,150 --> 02:43:22,953
So a motion to approve the minutes from February 21st, 2024.

1627
02:43:22,993 --> 02:43:27,737
Seconded.

1628
02:43:31,000 --> 02:43:32,261
Vice Chair Emily Hederman?

1629
02:43:32,881 --> 02:43:32,981
Aye.

1630
02:43:33,982 --> 02:43:34,603
Peter Cowles?

1631
02:43:35,524 --> 02:43:35,624
Aye.

1632
02:43:36,264 --> 02:43:36,905
Ari Fishman?

1633
02:43:37,886 --> 02:43:37,986
Aye.

1634
02:43:38,506 --> 02:43:39,427
Pam Mariansky?

1635
02:43:40,188 --> 02:43:40,288
Aye.

1636
02:43:40,868 --> 02:43:42,770
And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.

1637
02:43:49,428 --> 02:43:51,929
Pam, did I call your name on the last thing that we voted on?

1638
02:43:53,070 --> 02:43:54,410
Okay, I just wanted to, okay.

1639
02:43:54,931 --> 02:43:56,111
I just wanted to make sure.

1640
02:43:59,633 --> 02:44:03,596
I'm inserting names here because you guys keep switching on my screen.

1641
02:44:03,636 --> 02:44:07,578
So it's like I wanted to make sure that I got you.

1642
02:44:07,598 --> 02:44:09,439
Okay, so motion to adjourn.

1643
02:44:11,140 --> 02:44:15,963
Unless, oh, before we adjourn, are there any other updates that the city may have or that the board may have?

1644
02:44:18,132 --> 02:44:28,759
I will say that, and we'll discuss this more, but I've been thinking about revisiting rules and regulations, especially for administrative procedures on site plan review.

1645
02:44:28,779 --> 02:44:36,944
And I know that site plan review is part of zoning, so I want to make sure that I have substantial comments for the board to review as well as the PDS staff.

1646
02:44:37,845 --> 02:44:39,226
That's the only thing I've been thinking about.

1647
02:44:39,246 --> 02:44:51,450
And I don't know if any of you have been thinking about any of the rules and regulations going forward, but that's something to probably provide to the PS staff as soon as possible, especially if it includes anything that's part of zone.

1648
02:44:52,050 --> 02:45:01,874
So, but the administrative procedures, um, for site plan is what's been on my mind.

1649
02:45:06,695 --> 02:45:08,857
So a motion to adjourn?

1650
02:45:14,582 --> 02:45:15,162
I so move.

1651
02:45:16,683 --> 02:45:18,064
Second.

1652
02:45:18,825 --> 02:45:20,186
Vice Chair Emily Herrmann?

1653
02:45:20,867 --> 02:45:20,987
Aye.

1654
02:45:21,888 --> 02:45:22,488
Peter Cowles?

1655
02:45:23,309 --> 02:45:23,429
Aye.

1656
02:45:24,049 --> 02:45:24,670
Ari Fishman?

1657
02:45:25,451 --> 02:45:25,571
Aye.

1658
02:45:26,591 --> 02:45:27,492
Pam Mariansky?

1659
02:45:28,053 --> 02:45:28,153
Aye.

1660
02:45:28,733 --> 02:45:30,775
And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm an aye.

1661
02:45:31,275 --> 02:45:32,456
Thank you all so much.

1662
02:45:32,476 --> 02:45:34,138
Have a good evening.

1663
02:45:34,941 --> 02:45:35,933
Bye everyone, good night.
