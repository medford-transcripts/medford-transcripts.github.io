1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, at this point, we have quorum.

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:10,664
[SPEAKER_08]: So please, um, uh, I'm not sure if we should officially start the meeting, but feel free to just go ahead.

3
00:00:10,724 --> 00:00:13,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this will be part of Joel recording.

4
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:13,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

5
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:15,246
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to make it very brief.

6
00:00:15,346 --> 00:00:21,869
[SPEAKER_00]: The city right now has, um, if you're not aware to survey opportunities, I'll talk about wayfinding first.

7
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:28,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we did a pilot here in the city the past couple of years, and now we're looking to really roll it out aggressively as a permanent program.

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:37,377
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a survey for wayfinding directionals throughout the city that we'd love to get some feedback, especially from this group in particular, certainly.

9
00:00:39,259 --> 00:00:43,562
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll share that and I'll dump all the links into the chat here before I hop out.

10
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:45,484
[SPEAKER_00]: So wayfinding, great.

11
00:00:45,804 --> 00:00:49,787
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also in the middle of our open space and recreation plan update.

12
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:57,734
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a required document from the state that every municipality needs to update on a, I think it's a seven year basis.

13
00:00:58,337 --> 00:01:00,418
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at our three-year extension right now.

14
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:08,440
[SPEAKER_00]: So this will be anything that has to do with our park lands as well as recreation, how we're using our bike paths, all of that good stuff.

15
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:16,203
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really want a lot of participation hopefully from our residents and again, captive audience, I would love to hear from this group.

16
00:01:16,803 --> 00:01:18,324
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an ongoing survey for that.

17
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:28,147
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a workshop that will be next Wednesday, September 10th at the Medford Arts Collaborative Building on Mystic Ave.

18
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,272
[SPEAKER_00]: that starts at six.

19
00:01:30,792 --> 00:01:33,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that'll just be some small group discussions.

20
00:01:34,175 --> 00:01:38,659
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so again, I'll put that information into the chat so everybody can see that.

21
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,045
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but just trying to get some, some feedback from this, this wonderful group, if possible.

22
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:48,988
[SPEAKER_06]: With the record, could you identify yourself so we have that?

23
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:51,050
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's, that's an important piece.

24
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:51,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

25
00:01:51,491 --> 00:01:52,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, my name is Teresa Dupont.

26
00:01:53,252 --> 00:01:56,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the community preservation act,

27
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,574
[SPEAKER_00]: manager for the city, CPA manager for the city, Teresa Dupont.

28
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:02,275
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm in the planning department.

29
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:03,176
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

30
00:02:03,336 --> 00:02:03,756
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great.

31
00:02:03,996 --> 00:02:08,199
[SPEAKER_06]: Got to make sure we haven't started the meeting officially yet.

32
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,120
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to add it as a preamble to the minutes.

33
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:11,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

34
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:11,962
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

35
00:02:12,702 --> 00:02:14,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Dropping the information in the chat now.

36
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:16,645
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

37
00:02:16,745 --> 00:02:19,567
[SPEAKER_05]: It was nice to see you, Ernie.

38
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:20,468
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't seen a while.

39
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:21,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

40
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:22,549
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

41
00:02:22,609 --> 00:02:22,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Be good.

42
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:23,490
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, everybody.

43
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:27,915
[SPEAKER_00]: Recording stopped.

44
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:35,471
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let me take care of that cord to the recording in progress.

45
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:36,392
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

46
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, with that, it looks like we have enough people to start.

47
00:02:45,443 --> 00:02:58,171
[SPEAKER_08]: So as the chair, I hereby call the August 2025 Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission meeting to order.

48
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:00,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Secretary, will you please call the roll?

00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:01,694

[SPEAKER_06]: Bruce Kulik, secretary, here.

54
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:13,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Jared Powell here, Emily manure.

55
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:16,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you say Emily?

56
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,953
[SPEAKER_06]: I did, but that's because Emily is right above your name.

57
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:25,396
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just did one of those, you know, whatever.

58
00:03:26,037 --> 00:03:28,619
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.

59
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,462
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

60
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:33,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

61
00:03:35,344 --> 00:03:38,147

00:03:57,786 --> 00:03:59,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Chris Stivers, Stivers?

66
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:00,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Stivers.

67
00:04:00,388 --> 00:04:00,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Stivers.

68
00:04:00,748 --> 00:04:01,048
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?

69
00:04:01,468 --> 00:04:01,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

70
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:02,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Say again?

71
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:03,149
[SPEAKER_06]: Stivers.

72
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,190
[SPEAKER_06]: Stivers, sorry.

73
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:04,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

74
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:05,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep.

75
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:06,692
[SPEAKER_06]: And Anna Rankert.

76
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:09,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.

77
00:04:09,366 --> 00:04:13,528
[SPEAKER_06]: So let me mark the ones who are not present.

78
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:22,171
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we have a quorum and we may proceed.

79
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:24,652
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a guest tonight.

80
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:29,905
[SPEAKER_08]: I do not see any guests tonight.

81
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:37,549
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, is there a call for the approval of the minutes for July 31st, 2025?

82
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:38,390
[SPEAKER_08]: So moved.

83
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,092
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded.

84
00:04:42,952 --> 00:04:45,253
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, hearing a second, all in favor?

85
00:04:45,273 --> 00:04:46,514
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

86
00:04:46,894 --> 00:04:47,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

87
00:04:48,215 --> 00:04:48,635
[SPEAKER_08]: All opposed?

88
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:48,715
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

89
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:53,037
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, hearing none, the motion passes.

90
00:04:53,558 --> 00:04:54,338
[SPEAKER_08]: Minutes are approved.

91
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:02,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, all right, in that case, moving on to announcements.

92
00:05:04,434 --> 00:05:16,938
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing I wanted to bring up during the announcements, or at least raise for a future discussion point was the Route 60 repainting of the Mystic Valley Parkway.

93
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:26,930
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I think it's something that we should address as a commission and possibly raise to the necessary entities that.

94
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:34,119
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently, I'm not sure if everyone was aware of this, but the so.

95
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:52,667
[SPEAKER_08]: The bridge passing between Medford and Arlington has recently been repainted as part of a future iteration of the improvements, and right now there are possibly a few items that should be addressed if this is entirely repaved in the future.

96
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,608
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to raise that as a discussion point.

97
00:05:56,748 --> 00:06:08,131
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize that I did not, I only became aware of it in the last few days and didn't have the time to raise this as an official meeting point before the agenda was published.

98
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:12,192
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would like to have that raised at some point later in the meeting.

99
00:06:12,492 --> 00:06:18,333
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to discuss this now, or we can discuss this later on when, I think.

100
00:06:18,373 --> 00:06:21,754
[SPEAKER_06]: Put that in the infrastructure section.

101
00:06:22,574 --> 00:06:23,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, OK, yeah.

102
00:06:23,335 --> 00:06:26,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully Todd will be with us if he's joining us.

103
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,642
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, sounds good.

104
00:06:28,783 --> 00:06:34,090
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is the primary thing that I would like to address today.

105
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,978
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm sorry, does anyone else have any announcements that they would like to make?

106
00:06:41,707 --> 00:06:42,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Emily.

107
00:06:43,609 --> 00:06:45,070
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of quick things.

108
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:58,461
[SPEAKER_03]: One is you may have noticed that there are now plastic wayfinding signs to help people get across the square from the Clipper Ship Connector to the other parts of the Mystic River Path.

109
00:06:59,862 --> 00:07:07,228
[SPEAKER_03]: You probably didn't realize that the Clipper Ship Connector is actually just the project name, and the path is just called the Mystic River Path, like everything else.

110
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:13,994
[SPEAKER_03]: So Myra got a, I think got a grant to do this.

111
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:20,960
[SPEAKER_03]: It still is like the quick and dirty version, but I went and helped put them up.

112
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,366
[SPEAKER_03]: There are now at least signs telling you like the least bad way to get across Medford Square.

113
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:30,468
[SPEAKER_03]: They do ask you to get off and walk in the business district.

114
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,990
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that it's not what we really want.

115
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:46,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully once MassDOT does their project that's coming down the pike, there will eventually be a crosswalk to actually get people across Main Street somewhat more reasonably.

116
00:07:47,454 --> 00:07:52,835
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meantime, at least somebody who doesn't know where they're going has enough signage to actually help them figure it out.

117
00:07:52,935 --> 00:07:55,095
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a good step.

118
00:07:56,016 --> 00:08:01,797
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wish that that had been part of the planning for the Clippership Connector in the first place, because we only had 10 years to

119
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:09,563
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out that this would be a problem and not have to do this this way at the end, but I'm glad that we did it one way or another.

120
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:18,070
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to say thank you to Carla, Alexander, Myra for doing this and making this happen and also to Todd for coming out.

121
00:08:19,511 --> 00:08:23,294
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, it's great that it went up and it's there.

122
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:26,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to also add.

123
00:08:28,172 --> 00:08:34,714
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we move on, we have actually a clipper ship connector access that I had asked Todd to help us with later.

124
00:08:36,214 --> 00:08:39,475
[SPEAKER_06]: We should keep any other further comments for that section.

125
00:08:39,975 --> 00:08:40,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sure.

126
00:08:40,415 --> 00:08:46,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say one other possible addition for either the.

127
00:08:48,765 --> 00:09:03,951
[SPEAKER_03]: police working group topic or for the infrastructure topic when we get there, um, is, um, is I would like to talk about maybe approaches or our thoughts about door zone bike lanes moving forward.

128
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:09,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so maybe that's something we should add to one of those topics later in the meeting.

129
00:09:09,793 --> 00:09:16,336
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to hear what Todd has to say about it too, if we, um, if we are fortunate enough to have him attend.

130
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:17,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

131
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:20,870
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that.

132
00:09:22,111 --> 00:09:22,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

133
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:28,452
[SPEAKER_06]: So you want to add a, I thought we, I thought I saw an email about that as well.

134
00:09:28,893 --> 00:09:43,617
[SPEAKER_03]: I did, I did email about it, but I wasn't, I sort of, I was sort of asking, well, should this be just, should this be a infrastructure discussion or should this be a bike safety meeting topic?

135
00:09:44,137 --> 00:09:47,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I've noted that you want an agenda item for next meeting.

136
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:48,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

137
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:49,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

138
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:49,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's fine.

139
00:09:58,113 --> 00:10:03,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, just following up on that really quickly.

140
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:12,011
[SPEAKER_08]: That actually also raises an announcement I would like to make on, or at least

141
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:14,643
[SPEAKER_08]: separate announcement.

142
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:22,931
[SPEAKER_08]: The Hills Hill pump track is also officially opening in Arlington on the 6th.

143
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:32,880
[SPEAKER_08]: So while that is not within Medford and is not our jurisdiction, I would like to at least make that part of the public record that that is opening and

144
00:10:34,662 --> 00:10:44,122
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a wonderful community resource for people of all ages to go and have an opportunity to experiment with mountain biking skills.

145
00:10:44,462 --> 00:10:45,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, go ahead, Emily.

146
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was just going to say about that.

147
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:51,312
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a post about that on Facebook today.

148
00:10:51,812 --> 00:11:07,338
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I thought was especially hilarious was the directions that they were telling people to use on the post to get to it were giving GPS coordinates, because there aren't actually signs at the places that you need to get off of the Minuteman.

149
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:12,882
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I keep harping on about signage for these things.

150
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:17,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, we have all these paths that have no names because they have no signs and they have no labels.

151
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,988
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, that's my axe to grind.

152
00:11:21,409 --> 00:11:30,676
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just saw this Facebook post about that pump track, and it was giving you GPS direct coordinates to figure out where to leave the Minuteman to get to it.

153
00:11:30,756 --> 00:11:34,058
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just thought that that was sort of hilarious.

154
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:35,660
[SPEAKER_06]: Daniel, what is this?

155
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,442
[SPEAKER_06]: You call it the Hills Hill contract?

156
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:41,598
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, playground by the ice rink.

157
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,061
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the official name of the playground.

158
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:46,543
[SPEAKER_08]: It is called.

159
00:11:49,005 --> 00:11:53,949
[SPEAKER_08]: I can if you would like, I can probably hold on.

160
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:55,490
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the.

161
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:59,734
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a mountain bike track path.

162
00:11:59,754 --> 00:12:00,135
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?

163
00:12:02,317 --> 00:12:03,998
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's officially a.

164
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:13,474
[SPEAKER_08]: skills track designed to be both a pump track and a jump track.

165
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:23,397
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they might also have a small-scale mountain bike course, like a short course track on it as well.

166
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:33,621
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was something that was originally, I believe, I am not aware of the entire history of Hills Hill being developed.

167
00:12:34,982 --> 00:12:49,440
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was something that Arlington ended up pushing for after several, I guess, youths ended up developing like their own mountain bike course in the woods near that prison.

168
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,061
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

169
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,984
[SPEAKER_08]: So ultimately it got taken on by the town of Arlington.

170
00:12:55,004 --> 00:13:02,009
[SPEAKER_08]: They ended up officially sanctioning a, I guess, fully built skills park there.

171
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:07,274
[SPEAKER_08]: And it has finally come to fruition and will be opened on the 6th, so Saturday.

172
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:14,879
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's something that is, I think, a wonderful addition to the local community.

173
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though it is outside of our jurisdiction, I think it is worthwhile.

174
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:33,852
[SPEAKER_06]: It is apropos to the next agenda item, which, unfortunately, Scott emailed me about an hour ago and said that he will not be able to make it tonight, which is too bad, because I was looking forward to hear more about what his ideas were.

175
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:35,353
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's asked to reschedule.

176
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:41,537
[SPEAKER_06]: For next week's, I'll have to go back and be in touch with him to find out if he can make it to the next meeting instead.

177
00:13:42,237 --> 00:13:43,738
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just wanted to relay that.

178
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:54,466
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is interesting that maybe several of us on our own might want to just go over there and see what it's all about so we have a sense of what Scott's talking about.

179
00:13:57,568 --> 00:13:59,770
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I entirely agree.

180
00:14:01,531 --> 00:14:03,212
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't speak to the car park.

181
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:14,276
[SPEAKER_08]: pump track at all, but if any, again, if anyone is able to go to Hills Hill, you might be able to get some ideas to like what it is, what that design looks like.

182
00:14:15,656 --> 00:14:16,837
[SPEAKER_08]: But thanks for the update there.

183
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:19,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

184
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:26,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I will also have to look up some information on the car part pump track.

185
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:27,960
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

186
00:14:30,548 --> 00:14:35,111
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, uh, with that, are there any other announcements that anyone would like to bring up?

187
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:47,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I will admit that the Hills Hill announcement sort of came spur of the moment when I saw the car park pump track update coming up and I realized that that was, uh, yep, sorry, go ahead, Chris.

188
00:14:49,428 --> 00:14:50,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a couple of things.

189
00:14:50,789 --> 00:15:00,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I was actually going to mention that in West Medford, there's been a few years where there's been some new bike lanes painted, which has been pretty exciting for me.

190
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:05,820
[SPEAKER_09]: So the Rotary, as you mentioned, but then also along, was it Arlington Road?

191
00:15:06,961 --> 00:15:15,588
[SPEAKER_09]: From the Rotary, Arlington Street, all the way up to Duggar Park, now has a bike lane, a contraflow, well, it turns into a contraflow.

192
00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:25,181
[SPEAKER_09]: And then at the tail end of Harvard street, going up to where it hits, um, uh, mystic Valley Parkway.

193
00:15:26,023 --> 00:15:27,965
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's been nice to see some progress.

194
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:28,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Um.

195
00:15:30,342 --> 00:15:47,580
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing, and this is maybe an agenda topic for possibly next meeting, but I spent a while a few weeks ago looking at the Medford bike master plan document, which I believe was updated in 2016 and a lot of it's now.

196
00:15:51,433 --> 00:15:53,895
[SPEAKER_09]: out of date with all the things that have been happening.

197
00:15:54,035 --> 00:16:04,142
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's worth a discussion over whether we try to refresh that, maybe like a 2026 version of that plan that's been updated with the current state of the art.

198
00:16:05,263 --> 00:16:08,605
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a request for an agenda item, so that's now in the minutes.

199
00:16:10,006 --> 00:16:10,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

200
00:16:11,047 --> 00:16:14,490
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one comment about that is there supposedly was,

201
00:16:15,792 --> 00:16:21,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I, uh, there was some effort in the city to work on an updated version of it.

202
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:32,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and there was a, a graduate intern who was working on it and there was, um, there used to be a DPW employee who was working on it.

203
00:16:32,997 --> 00:16:39,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but that person left to work for the town of Brookline and the internship ended and it was never finished.

204
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,280
[SPEAKER_03]: And that position has not been filled.

205
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:48,449
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this is this is kind of one of our ongoing things, but maybe maybe this is.

206
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:59,104
[SPEAKER_03]: The agenda item could be that we either talk about do we need to just do this again ourselves because the city isn't doing it, or we need to push for the things that make.

207
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:09,735
[SPEAKER_03]: put more pressure on the city to finish whatever they were, however far they got, which I don't think we even really had an update.

208
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:13,218
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't really even know what the status of it was.

209
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:21,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, why don't we keep that thought for the next meeting when we have the agenda that'll just talk in general about the master plan and we can figure out what that means.

210
00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:45,145
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, one thing I would like to, or I guess at least ask, um, for, uh, people like Emily and Bruce who've and Jared, who've been on the commission longer than I, is this something that we can offer assistance in, or is this something that needs to be undertaken by a city engineer?

211
00:17:47,749 --> 00:17:52,474
[SPEAKER_03]: The original one was just the bike commission just did it.

212
00:17:52,494 --> 00:17:55,577
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was mostly Pat who put it together, right?

213
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:57,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think so.

214
00:17:57,218 --> 00:18:02,524
[SPEAKER_03]: And a couple of other people that aren't here anymore.

215
00:18:02,544 --> 00:18:06,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it was sort of...

216
00:18:10,398 --> 00:18:16,101
[SPEAKER_03]: embraced, but it was it was just a it was it was it came entirely from the bike commission.

217
00:18:16,121 --> 00:18:26,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that when Amy was here, there was more of an idea like, hey, there's a person actually whose job it is to deal with these kinds of things.

218
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:31,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that was kind of one of her projects.

219
00:18:32,588 --> 00:18:34,329
[SPEAKER_03]: But her position hasn't been

220
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:50,217
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, so we could either, we could either decide that we just have to do it ourselves again, or we need to put more pressure on them to, you know, find a point person whose actual job it is to do it.

221
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:52,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

222
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:57,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that insight.

223
00:18:57,385 --> 00:18:58,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with you.

224
00:18:58,526 --> 00:19:03,149
[SPEAKER_08]: I do want to be able to recognize Noam and Leah.

225
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I see your hands.

226
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:13,337
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess my question is more veered towards whether we can help with this or if we can't.

227
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:14,858
[SPEAKER_08]: And it sounds like we can.

228
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,820
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's something that we should keep in mind there.

229
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, go ahead, Noam.

230
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:35,221
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to go back to the infrastructure point about the stuff that got added in West Medford around Mystic River Road and Route 60 and I guess make a comment or ask a question for the notes and maybe for when Todd hops on.

231
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:39,342
[SPEAKER_02]: But do we have clarity who owns like enforcement in that area?

232
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:43,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it does appear there's some change management that needs to happen.

233
00:19:44,283 --> 00:20:06,344
[SPEAKER_02]: where people park their cars and stuff because they've got lanes striped and all that but if you go through the area you'll notice anyone using Duggar Park still has their car parked on this bike lane even though they have like parking spaces all painted out for them and I recall from past discussions that might be like state police territory and not something the city is able to ticket on.

234
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:12,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if that's up for discussion now or something we have to table until perhaps time.

235
00:20:12,784 --> 00:20:20,107
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be worth, at least if nothing else, put it on our list to ask the police department if that's actually in their jurisdiction.

236
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:23,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I would raise both of those.

237
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:28,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I have outstanding items with the police department.

238
00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:30,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's put it on the list for us to

239
00:20:32,154 --> 00:20:34,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily, for me and you to raise with them.

240
00:20:35,677 --> 00:20:41,623
[SPEAKER_08]: But also, we can have a further discussion about that once we get to the infrastructure updates.

241
00:20:42,223 --> 00:20:44,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I see Leah, and then after that, Ernie.

242
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:55,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Not related to what I was going to say, but I was, for now, is it like parking violations or moving violations that are happening?

243
00:20:55,741 --> 00:20:56,302
[SPEAKER_02]: It's parking.

244
00:20:56,362 --> 00:21:06,730
[SPEAKER_02]: You have like a bunch of no parking signs and no stopping signs, but old habits seem to be kind of consistent here, where people just park where they would be accustomed to parking.

245
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:14,897
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably worth mentioning when you bring it up to the police department, because I think it's the enforcement ability is slightly different for those.

246
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:20,561
[SPEAKER_04]: But I had a comment on the bike master plan discussion.

247
00:21:21,982 --> 00:21:29,248
[SPEAKER_04]: One is it might be a good idea to ask for someone from the city to give us an update on this.

248
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that we want to

249
00:21:35,301 --> 00:21:40,743
[SPEAKER_04]: add it to the agenda and talk about it for next meeting, but it would be good if next meeting also we could hear about where they left off.

250
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:49,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know how much work there is left to do and what they were aiming for with the update.

251
00:21:49,446 --> 00:21:55,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that will be a vital piece of information and deciding if we want to take it on or not.

252
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:03,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Then I'll also add that in terms of a planning document,

253
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:16,203
[SPEAKER_04]: The way that other places are doing their, their bike network plans or master plans typically involve.

254
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:21,266
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say the level of outreach at least that, like.

255
00:22:22,066 --> 00:22:24,787
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford, what is that called?

256
00:22:24,827 --> 00:22:28,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the community plan or whatever they just did with the Medford master plan.

257
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:29,830
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like CDB.

258
00:22:31,013 --> 00:22:35,234
[SPEAKER_08]: The community development board, is that where you're referring?

259
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:42,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the development board, not like the zoning stuff, but whatever they just did with updated a master plan or whatever.

260
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:44,097
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of outreach.

261
00:22:44,737 --> 00:22:47,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford comprehensive plan.

262
00:22:47,198 --> 00:22:47,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

263
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:49,278
[SPEAKER_09]: To do it well, do it right.

264
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:55,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Medford's city outreach is shockingly good to start with, but just another.

265
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:08,646
[SPEAKER_04]: thing to think about about what we want our goals to be with that and what we really want it to reflect like our opinion or the city's opinion or the residents opinion or some of both.

266
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:11,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

267
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks, Leah.

268
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,070
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

269
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:17,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

270
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Ernie.

271
00:23:19,251 --> 00:23:19,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

272
00:23:20,111 --> 00:23:22,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Emily, for the for the history report.

273
00:23:23,012 --> 00:23:24,312
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how I see it, too.

274
00:23:25,092 --> 00:23:36,035
[SPEAKER_05]: And to double down and say that the development of the master plan around biking infrastructure is very much in our wheelhouse, our bailiwick.

275
00:23:36,195 --> 00:23:37,095
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know

276
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:54,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Leah, if there is a there there who we consult with or ask for tutelage on this, we have to take the bull by the horns here for next year and reorganize and reprioritize the master plan, I think.

277
00:23:55,703 --> 00:24:08,051
[SPEAKER_05]: A tiny note on jurisdiction, I believe Duggar Park and its access is the city, but, shit, what's their name now?

278
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:08,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.

279
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:16,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Mystic Valley Parkway is the jurisdiction of DCR and therefore the state police.

280
00:24:18,538 --> 00:24:19,399
[SPEAKER_05]: And not local.

281
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:27,688
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why it all gets confusing as to how things are painted, who gets ticketed, who you call when there's an issue.

282
00:24:28,729 --> 00:24:30,411
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just my understanding.

283
00:24:30,451 --> 00:24:35,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Duggar Park somehow and its access falls within DCR, but I doubt it.

284
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:39,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Ernie.

285
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:45,477
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we've diverged a bit.

286
00:24:45,497 --> 00:24:50,620
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you all don't mind, I guess in this case, I'm looking down the agenda.

287
00:24:52,822 --> 00:24:55,863
[SPEAKER_08]: Scott is not here, neither is Dennis.

288
00:24:56,824 --> 00:25:01,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Emily, can you give a quick update on the bike racks purchase?

289
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:13,977
[SPEAKER_03]: So my most recent approach about getting the city to install bike racks is I've been pestering the mayor and the city council about making a specific budget item for it.

290
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,071
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, they want to know how much they cost.

291
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:24,653
[SPEAKER_03]: I have now asked Todd three or four times how much it costs to install per bike rack.

292
00:25:24,693 --> 00:25:27,114
[SPEAKER_03]: I can find out how much they cost to buy.

293
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:28,054
[SPEAKER_03]: That part's easy.

294
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:32,336
[SPEAKER_03]: But Todd has always said that the hard part is not necessarily the purchase price.

295
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:36,157
[SPEAKER_03]: It's having the staff and the resources to install them.

296
00:25:37,678 --> 00:25:43,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I have asked him several times, and I haven't gotten an answer to a single one of those emails.

297
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:47,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hoping that he comes tonight, and I will ask him again.

298
00:25:47,444 --> 00:25:57,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, if I don't hear anything, I'll go back and say, I haven't heard anything, I've been asking, but when push comes to shove,

299
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:02,295
[SPEAKER_03]: you stick a hole in the ground and you stick a metal pole in it with some concrete.

300
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:08,241
[SPEAKER_03]: So it can't be that different from the cost to install a signpost or a parking meter.

301
00:26:08,922 --> 00:26:18,312
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can figure out how much it costs to install a signpost or a parking meter, that should at least get us into the right ballpark and we can figure out how much money we need to ask for.

302
00:26:19,413 --> 00:26:28,278
[SPEAKER_03]: For the installation of some number of bike racks per year, my suggestion would be to ask for something like

303
00:26:29,763 --> 00:26:33,645
[SPEAKER_03]: 40 the first year and then 20 or 30 every year after that.

304
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:38,808
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that's not, this isn't a one-time thing.

305
00:26:39,368 --> 00:26:43,951
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be done on an ongoing basis, partly because there's always attrition.

306
00:26:43,971 --> 00:26:45,592
[SPEAKER_03]: They always get broken eventually.

307
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:46,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing lasts forever.

308
00:26:48,253 --> 00:26:56,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And partly because at the rate of 40 per year, it would still take us a number of years to actually have

309
00:26:58,072 --> 00:27:03,393
[SPEAKER_03]: a bike rack in easy reach from every place you want to go.

310
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:23,478
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, you know, we have the map that we've sent in, which supposedly will be used to install something like 40 bike racks when this grant comes through, which we've been told about for, what, two years now, almost a year and a half.

311
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:30,300
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but we haven't managed to get any updates on that from Todd either.

312
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:45,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but if it's like 40 bike racks every however many years, um, I think, I think we got something like 25 or 30 across the city in like 2018 maybe.

313
00:27:45,803 --> 00:27:52,305
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so we're talking seven, every seven years we get a couple dozen.

314
00:27:52,325 --> 00:27:53,325
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not.

315
00:27:54,225 --> 00:28:00,988
[SPEAKER_03]: that doesn't, that's not gonna make it enough to be able to like ride your bike to a business and be able to park there.

316
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:04,889
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's where that is.

317
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:12,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fairly frustrated that I haven't actually been able to, you know, I have, and in this case, maybe he's just busy.

318
00:28:12,912 --> 00:28:21,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm fairly frustrated that I've emailed a bunch of times and I haven't even gotten, I'll get back to you on that kind of an answer, but that's where it is.

319
00:28:22,898 --> 00:28:27,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Before I recognize you there, Ernie, Emily, would you like to loop me in?

320
00:28:28,863 --> 00:28:37,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to try and set up a meeting between me, you, Todd, and Tim, and see what I can do there.

321
00:28:37,328 --> 00:28:47,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize that, not that I have necessarily any more clout than you, but I'm happy to help attempt to move this along as well.

322
00:28:47,516 --> 00:28:48,156
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you.

323
00:28:49,797 --> 00:28:51,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, hold on.

324
00:28:51,137 --> 00:28:53,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me recognize Ernie on that.

325
00:28:53,978 --> 00:28:58,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just if you want to do a little tail wagging the dog on this.

326
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:10,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that if you want to talk to the people, I can't remember his name, who runs the DPW squads that actually do the work.

327
00:29:10,801 --> 00:29:12,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Owen Cortala.

328
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:14,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Owen.

329
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you talking about Owen?

330
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:24,715
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I'm talking people who fix the potholes and do the curbs and do all that stuff and would be doing this stuff.

331
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:31,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I've approached him once around the painting the potholes thing years ago.

332
00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:41,444
[SPEAKER_05]: He, of course, gets the directives from the city from Todd and Tim as to what to do that week and gets it done.

333
00:29:41,464 --> 00:29:42,464
[SPEAKER_05]: He is

334
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:58,408
[SPEAKER_05]: has told me he's always available at 7 a.m sharp at his office down at the Public Works site to describe what he's going to be doing then, and then

335
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:05,593
[SPEAKER_05]: and I'm sure can tell you how many hours it's going to take to put in a bike rack.

336
00:30:06,373 --> 00:30:20,241
[SPEAKER_05]: So it may not be a bad idea to know what's actually going on as well as inquiring from the head and co-heads that we know well but have been unresponsive.

337
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:27,657
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can actually go see this guy who has the shovel in his hand for his people, but only at 7 a.m.

338
00:30:27,697 --> 00:30:37,543
[SPEAKER_05]: at the DPW office, where he gets his crews out for the day and is then non-reachable for the rest of the workday.

339
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:39,865
[SPEAKER_05]: So just a little hint.

340
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

341
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:57,595
[SPEAKER_08]: If you end up coming up with a name, let us know just so that if one of us end up deciding to show up to the DPW unannounced, we know who to bang on the door of.

342
00:30:58,436 --> 00:31:00,057
[SPEAKER_08]: But that is appreciated.

343
00:31:00,097 --> 00:31:00,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Ernie.

344
00:31:09,243 --> 00:31:11,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other updates in that vein?

345
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:32,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I was hoping that there would be a little bit more of an update and eventually I would like to have an item to a motion to approve a request that we're asking for such and such an amount of money, but don't have that yet.

346
00:31:34,443 --> 00:31:36,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I do understand that.

347
00:31:38,826 --> 00:31:39,287
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

348
00:31:40,287 --> 00:31:40,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess.

349
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:42,911
[SPEAKER_08]: There is nothing else.

350
00:31:43,652 --> 00:31:45,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to move on to the police working group.

351
00:31:47,713 --> 00:31:51,014
[SPEAKER_08]: At the moment, not exactly any movement there.

352
00:31:52,475 --> 00:31:53,295
[SPEAKER_08]: That's on me.

353
00:31:53,535 --> 00:31:58,597
[SPEAKER_08]: I have discussed with Emily possible items to bring up with the police department.

354
00:31:59,298 --> 00:32:09,802
[SPEAKER_08]: I feel that our next meeting should be strategic and that we shouldn't, just due to the constraints of scheduling and perhaps,

355
00:32:11,282 --> 00:32:16,526
[SPEAKER_08]: a somewhat cold reception, for lack of a better word, that we had last time.

356
00:32:16,546 --> 00:32:24,292
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to make the next meeting that we have with them somewhat strategic in our asks.

357
00:32:24,973 --> 00:32:38,283
[SPEAKER_08]: I do know that Bruce has offered to, or perhaps has offered, if my memory recalls correctly, to run a League of American Bicyclists

358
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:42,325
[SPEAKER_08]: safety training for them if they would so request that.

359
00:32:43,166 --> 00:32:50,950
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's something, Bruce, if you're still willing to run that, it's something that I would possibly bring to them.

360
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:57,233
[SPEAKER_08]: But I would like to just make sure that I'm not overstepping my bounds in offering your time.

361
00:32:58,594 --> 00:33:00,415
[SPEAKER_08]: So no particular updates there.

362
00:33:01,135 --> 00:33:03,357
[SPEAKER_08]: I will take, if anyone would like to,

363
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:11,338
[SPEAKER_08]: send specific requests to me to consider for the discussion with the working group.

364
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:13,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to evaluate those.

365
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:21,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Things regarding helmets, I think should be held until updates there.

366
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:28,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I do have updates, maybe not the best updates, but I would like to hold any discussion around helmets until then.

367
00:33:29,762 --> 00:33:33,643
[SPEAKER_08]: So I open the floor to anyone who would like to make particular requests when I'm

368
00:33:34,604 --> 00:33:39,469
[SPEAKER_08]: constructing the agenda for the police discussion.

369
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:44,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we just email these to you?

370
00:33:46,177 --> 00:33:51,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, feel free to either email them to me or bring them up with me directly here.

371
00:33:56,343 --> 00:34:12,133
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for, um, the, some of the things that we have mentioned before, and that I think we are hoping to discuss with them are, um, things about, for example, parking enforcement, um, and parking next to bike lanes.

372
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:17,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and this would include like the parking by Duggar park.

373
00:34:17,997 --> 00:34:19,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and then.

374
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:34,049
[SPEAKER_03]: generally aggressive driving and passing and harassment and the possibility of eventually getting a officer on a bike.

375
00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:45,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, which there's, which is probably a longer term goal, but as far as we can tell, there isn't anybody on the force who rides a bike in Medford right now.

376
00:34:46,608 --> 00:34:48,289
[SPEAKER_03]: And that should, and that's really a shame.

377
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:54,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so those are, I think those are some of our, our top concerns for the moment.

378
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:59,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and those are the things that we've talked about already.

379
00:34:59,254 --> 00:34:59,374
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

380
00:35:06,328 --> 00:35:08,165
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry, go ahead, Leah.

381
00:35:09,662 --> 00:35:15,984
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just about to ask what has already been talked about and or rejected.

382
00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:17,704
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Emily.

383
00:35:18,685 --> 00:35:27,447
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I didn't hear in that list is a discussion about data for bike crashes.

384
00:35:29,908 --> 00:35:36,450
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if they have it, what kind they have, if it's somewhere easily accessible, if it's

385
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:44,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that great what can we, you know, what sort of feasible to make it a little bit better.

386
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:50,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, what kind of training they've had on like.

387
00:35:51,622 --> 00:35:55,245
[SPEAKER_04]: What they should do when there was a bike crash.

388
00:35:55,345 --> 00:36:03,952
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember a couple of years ago that Ernie had a little bit of a tough time with his own bike crash and getting reported in a.

389
00:36:05,602 --> 00:36:07,983
[SPEAKER_04]: not favorable or truthful way.

390
00:36:09,983 --> 00:36:24,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we did ask them before about what training they had for some of these things, and they were sort of vague and didn't really give us much of an answer to that.

391
00:36:24,327 --> 00:36:27,168
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's a good point that we should bring up, and also data.

392
00:36:28,328 --> 00:36:33,510
[SPEAKER_03]: We've mentioned before, but we should be sure to make sure that that's on our list this time.

393
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they kind of go, you know, hand in hand, I guess.

394
00:36:40,985 --> 00:36:56,899
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's also sort of an offering that we can make there if their data is not very good, like of sort of making our own little Google form or whatever of sort of places that people can

395
00:36:57,493 --> 00:37:09,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think the thing that we have talked about that we can ask for is to ask for a field to be added to see click fix for people to describe harassment incidents.

396
00:37:12,445 --> 00:37:16,528
[SPEAKER_03]: At the moment, there's nobody interested in receiving those reports except for us.

397
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:37,156
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the one concern I have with doing that is if there are incidents that really should involve the police and people report them that way and think that they have reported it to somebody who can do something about it.

398
00:37:38,236 --> 00:37:44,439
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really is only going to us so that we can then come back and say, hey, look at all of these reports we have.

399
00:37:46,312 --> 00:38:04,223
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to be just really careful about how we present that and how we describe it to make sure that people understand that it really is only for informational purposes and that nobody with the ability to take any action on this particular event is going to be reading it in any kind of timely manner.

400
00:38:07,245 --> 00:38:07,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed.

401
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:23,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Although that is a good call out for me to follow up on getting that section added to see click fix if nothing else other than for historical reporting.

402
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Bruce, do you mind?

403
00:38:27,215 --> 00:38:30,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we make a motion to direct you to do that?

404
00:38:31,678 --> 00:38:37,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I am happy to take a, I am happy to accept that motion.

405
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:49,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I hear a motion to have me as the chair officially follow up with the city to have that, I guess, category added to see click fix.

406
00:38:51,145 --> 00:39:12,274
[SPEAKER_03]: I would make that motion and I would also add to it that in the interests of expediency, we empower you to tell them how it should be configured and what kind of dropdowns it should have and what kind of details it needs to say what we need it to say, just because otherwise it'll take us three more meetings to approve all of those things.

407
00:39:14,515 --> 00:39:16,136
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that.

408
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:16,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I hear a second?

409
00:39:16,556 --> 00:39:17,336
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is my motion.

410
00:39:17,756 --> 00:39:18,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll second that.

411
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:20,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, all in favor.

412
00:39:20,535 --> 00:39:21,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Who seconded?

413
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:23,120
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, yeah.

414
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:24,282
[SPEAKER_06]: Please raise your hand.

415
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:26,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't hear it was Leah.

416
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:26,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

417
00:39:29,892 --> 00:39:30,953
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

418
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:33,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, before holding.

419
00:39:34,215 --> 00:39:34,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

420
00:39:34,696 --> 00:39:35,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

421
00:39:35,817 --> 00:39:36,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Before voting.

422
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:56,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I make an amendment that you also have the executive action to increase the scope of the request to other things that should also be added to see click fix that are related to our purview, such as a request for bike racks.

423
00:39:59,571 --> 00:40:22,142
[SPEAKER_08]: I, this, yes, I think that if it makes sense with how other towns have possibly done this in the future, I'm not sure if that's something that, I'm not sure if CClickFix is necessarily the place to go and put requests in, but I'm happy to support that.

424
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:22,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily?

425
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:42,692
[SPEAKER_03]: Just on that, I think that might be a separate agenda item just because that request, we really do want that to go to the DPW and not just to us, or it should be a separate category at the very least if the DPW just doesn't want to know about it.

426
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:47,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Somerville did recently add a bike rack request option to their 311 system.

427
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:56,881
[SPEAKER_03]: which is what they use instead of, it's basically the same as C-Click Fix, but it's a different provider.

428
00:40:57,481 --> 00:41:00,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So Somerville is doing it that way.

429
00:41:00,042 --> 00:41:08,686
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I raise that this could be two separate actions for two separate things with C-Click Fix?

430
00:41:08,826 --> 00:41:13,047
[SPEAKER_08]: I am happy to take both of those on if both of those want to be raised.

431
00:41:14,448 --> 00:41:17,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I would suggest that they'd be two separate actions for two separate things.

432
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:18,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

433
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:28,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm agnostic on that particular point, but they do have bike-related things in C-Click Fix in Medford already.

434
00:41:28,972 --> 00:41:34,178
[SPEAKER_07]: Presumably they are not only sending them to us, because I certainly don't see them.

435
00:41:35,272 --> 00:41:36,032
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

436
00:41:37,093 --> 00:41:46,916
[SPEAKER_03]: The incident report thing would be basically there's nobody in Medford currently who wants to hear about it.

437
00:41:47,436 --> 00:41:50,977
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only way to add that to C-Click Fix is to have it come to us.

438
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:54,719
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe that's true of bike racks as well.

439
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:55,399
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

440
00:41:56,339 --> 00:42:03,602
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a slightly different situation in that the police department is not

441
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:22,166
[SPEAKER_03]: isn't currently going to take much action on the basis of people saying they were harassed, but the DPW is the one that would be putting in the bike racks and that is the thing that they have the power to do if they have the funding and the directive to do it.

442
00:42:22,186 --> 00:42:32,628
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't want to hear it, then we can ask the city to put in that request and say that it only goes to us because nobody at the city is actually interested in it currently.

443
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:48,447
[SPEAKER_09]: To me, it makes sense to have that on cclickfix because we're essentially crowdsourcing recommendations for bike rack locations, and then we would filter those requests and put in the formal request to the DPW based off of public input.

444
00:42:51,203 --> 00:43:01,947
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm, I'm personal, I think that that makes sense, Chris, although I'm, I'm personally less interested in having any such requests come to us because I think they already know that we're interested in more bike racks.

445
00:43:02,187 --> 00:43:13,312
[SPEAKER_07]: I would much rather such requests come from citizens who are not on the bike commission just because it's, I don't know, sometimes they, they know what we're going to say already.

446
00:43:13,572 --> 00:43:15,753
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd, I'd rather it come from another source.

447
00:43:16,725 --> 00:43:36,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think the difference there is, or the point there is, if the DPW doesn't want that information, then we might as well have them, have those requests come to us so that we can pass them along and say, here, look is all the bike rack requests that the DPW doesn't want to hear about because they don't have the resources to do anything about it.

448
00:43:36,936 --> 00:43:38,797
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do actually at least have

449
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:45,020
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we have more than our own opinion in that we have this pile of C-click fix requests.

450
00:43:45,901 --> 00:43:49,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's still, it's not ideal, but it's better than nothing.

451
00:43:49,203 --> 00:43:56,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and the, and the like harassment incident reporting is kind of the same thing.

452
00:43:56,187 --> 00:44:02,870
[SPEAKER_03]: This is, this is to give us, to give more weight to us when we go to the city and ask for things.

453
00:44:03,851 --> 00:44:07,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, since the city is not currently doing anything with this information.

454
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:32,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, just summarize at this point, the motion that's on the table, which is to, um, empower Daniel to provide a C click fix agenda items, basically at his discretion to figure out, um, who should get them and lobby the city to have that happen.

455
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:35,619
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I have that recorded correctly?

456
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:37,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds right.

457
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:38,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

458
00:44:40,038 --> 00:44:41,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to take that on.

459
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So in that case with the amendment there, do I hear a motion?

460
00:44:47,745 --> 00:44:48,185
[SPEAKER_08]: So moved.

461
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:50,587
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, do I hear a second?

462
00:44:52,969 --> 00:44:53,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

463
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I see Ernie as the second.

464
00:44:56,732 --> 00:44:58,274
[SPEAKER_08]: In that case, all in favor?

465
00:44:59,174 --> 00:44:59,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

466
00:45:00,756 --> 00:45:01,797
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, all opposed?

467
00:45:03,456 --> 00:45:04,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Hearing none, the ayes have it.

468
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:11,041
[SPEAKER_08]: I will take my ultimate powers of CClickFix to the city.

469
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:14,182
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

470
00:45:14,282 --> 00:45:16,164
[SPEAKER_09]: One final note on that, Noam.

471
00:45:16,664 --> 00:45:21,026
[SPEAKER_09]: There is something in CClickFix for, like, parking issue.

472
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:24,528
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know where that goes.

473
00:45:26,269 --> 00:45:27,690
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes to parking enforcement.

474
00:45:29,972 --> 00:45:30,252
[SPEAKER_10]: Tough.

475
00:45:31,465 --> 00:45:37,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I've used that to like report things, report people parked in bike lanes basically.

476
00:45:40,768 --> 00:45:54,231
[SPEAKER_03]: In case anybody needs to know this, if you click on parking issue, it will ask you for the make and model and plates and everything of the vehicle, which takes a really long time to enter in on your phone.

477
00:45:54,791 --> 00:46:00,193
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you click on parking related issue, you can just put a picture and describe what's going on and be done with it.

478
00:46:01,452 --> 00:46:03,074
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it goes to the same place.

479
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:04,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably, yeah.

480
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:06,137
[SPEAKER_08]: G-I-L.

481
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:07,779
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, that's useful.

482
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:09,961
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

483
00:46:11,162 --> 00:46:11,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Awesome.

484
00:46:12,544 --> 00:46:17,109
[SPEAKER_08]: Little C-Click fix hacks.

485
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:19,111
[SPEAKER_08]: That can be used.

486
00:46:19,751 --> 00:46:23,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Not sure if that should be part of official record, but there it is.

487
00:46:24,899 --> 00:46:26,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, okay.

488
00:46:27,062 --> 00:46:32,731
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I guess if we can moving on to events, um, family bike ride, Jared.

489
00:46:35,481 --> 00:46:35,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

490
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:36,982
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

491
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:38,403
[SPEAKER_07]: I have this open.

492
00:46:38,483 --> 00:46:55,853
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the theme of non-responsive people, Paul Morgan, who we've spoken with from Family Bike Ride, has had to change the kind of

493
00:46:56,813 --> 00:47:01,438
[SPEAKER_07]: starting point and ending point based on some challenges I think you talked about last time in Arlington.

494
00:47:02,018 --> 00:47:09,385
[SPEAKER_07]: The plan now is to, I think, start at the Condon Show and bike to Assembly.

495
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:21,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Start in Medford, go through Medford Square, go through the Clippership Connector, and go along the nice path system that they used for the Halloween ride last time to end up at Assembly.

496
00:47:22,897 --> 00:47:46,676
[SPEAKER_07]: um so that is sunday october 26 i believe so they've had to read they've had to change the the dates a little bit um he talked to the medford police because the medford police had to write a letter of support to mastat in order to

497
00:47:48,017 --> 00:47:52,940
[SPEAKER_07]: put up some cones or something, I think, on the Craddock bridge just for safety reasons.

498
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:57,422
[SPEAKER_07]: So like he wanted to put cones on the Craddock bridge so that people would be safe.

499
00:47:58,563 --> 00:48:00,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Mastod says, okay, you need the police's permission.

500
00:48:00,924 --> 00:48:02,865
[SPEAKER_07]: The police wrote a letter saying we're cool with that.

501
00:48:03,106 --> 00:48:05,167
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently they did it very quickly, which was very nice.

502
00:48:07,368 --> 00:48:08,689
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they've got approval to do that.

503
00:48:09,249 --> 00:48:09,829
[SPEAKER_07]: He submitted his

504
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:17,945
[SPEAKER_07]: He found out that it's the mayor's office, apparently, that controls permits for special events, which is maybe a little counterintuitive.

505
00:48:18,986 --> 00:48:30,450
[SPEAKER_07]: But they've gone radio silent on him and have not responded to a bunch of requests from him, from the mayor and Alicia as well, specifically.

506
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:39,473
[SPEAKER_07]: So he has asked for some support from us, and also the director of community affairs, too, apparently have all

507
00:48:40,313 --> 00:48:44,629
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of stopped responding to his emails and voicemails, which is

508
00:48:47,593 --> 00:48:49,214
[SPEAKER_07]: frustrating, certainly.

509
00:48:49,874 --> 00:48:59,096
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if I'm happy or others I'm sure would be happy to send some more emails, but I'm not really sure exactly.

510
00:48:59,116 --> 00:49:12,820
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels like kind of a scattershot approach and you just kind of hope that the right person is either on the email thread or responds because their supervisor is on the email thread, you know, something to that effect.

511
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,060
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't know if anyone has any

512
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:23,423
[SPEAKER_07]: particularly close personal contacts that they certainly should not need to leverage in order to get a response here, but we might want to do so anyway.

513
00:49:23,443 --> 00:49:27,985
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where that is.

514
00:49:28,025 --> 00:49:36,968
[SPEAKER_07]: He basically needs some levers pulled to get people to wake up and pay attention to this very reasonable request to showcase a really nice new amenity in Medford.

515
00:49:39,089 --> 00:49:43,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately, the request here is to have one of us reach out to the mayor's office,

516
00:49:45,306 --> 00:49:53,035
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the mayor's office or any kind of, you know, sub office within the executive branch under the mayor, right.

517
00:49:53,055 --> 00:49:59,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, whichever we believe is the most likely to actually move this forward.

518
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:06,870
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the, you know, community affairs office or something should be a good option, but yeah, basically.

519
00:50:07,748 --> 00:50:15,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Jared, will you just loop me into the email with him really quickly?

520
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:35,203
[SPEAKER_08]: That way I can take that on just as the chair to, I'm not sure if we actually need a motion for this as this is something that is being driven externally and I'm just acting as a liaison, but I would be happy to see what I can do there.

521
00:50:35,483 --> 00:50:35,663
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool.

522
00:50:37,616 --> 00:50:40,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, I mean, I'm, that would be great.

523
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:40,899
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

524
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:54,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I don't know, maybe it takes a, uh, emotion if we want to have you kind of write a blurb or something about how awesome this sort of thing is and why we really need to pay attention to it.

525
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:56,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, which we've done before.

526
00:50:56,410 --> 00:51:02,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I think I've written something like that in the past that you could repurpose here if you want, but.

527
00:51:04,165 --> 00:51:07,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, I, I'm, I am entirely open to it.

528
00:51:07,568 --> 00:51:08,529
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Emily.

529
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:22,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I was just going to say, Jared, if you, since you've been the point of contact with Paul, you could, you might suggest that he, um, ask Carl Alexander to pass to the male's office as well.

530
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:25,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, the that.

531
00:51:26,593 --> 00:51:34,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Carl might be able, I think Carl would be interested and motivated to make this work and make this happen and might be more likely to get a response.

532
00:51:35,354 --> 00:51:35,655
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

533
00:51:36,895 --> 00:51:37,875
[SPEAKER_07]: He's with the Mystic.

534
00:51:38,635 --> 00:51:40,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Mystic River Watershed Association.

535
00:51:40,575 --> 00:51:40,815
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

536
00:51:42,956 --> 00:51:43,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

537
00:51:45,916 --> 00:51:46,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool.

538
00:51:46,056 --> 00:51:46,436
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

539
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:47,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, sounds good.

540
00:51:47,817 --> 00:51:55,078
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Daniel, then action items you're following up and I can also, um, see if Carl wants to separately advocate.

541
00:51:55,098 --> 00:51:55,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that fair?

542
00:51:57,650 --> 00:51:59,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that would be wonderful.

543
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:13,423
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a few items on my agenda and I wish I had more time for everything bike related right now in my life, but sadly, life can, we all know how that can happen.

544
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:19,849
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, I am happy to be a contact there.

545
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:22,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Cool, thank you.

546
00:52:25,065 --> 00:52:33,636
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, uh, I guess just, uh, sorry, uh, any other comments on that or Jared, did you have anything you want to follow up with?

547
00:52:33,736 --> 00:52:37,421
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take that as a no, if you remain off camera and muted.

548
00:52:40,103 --> 00:52:40,903
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, I'm good.

549
00:52:40,923 --> 00:52:42,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to step away for just a moment for the kiddos.

550
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:43,705
[SPEAKER_07]: But thank you.

551
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:45,325
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

552
00:52:45,986 --> 00:52:51,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so with that Harvester Energy Festival, that is coming up on October 18.

553
00:52:51,768 --> 00:53:00,752
[SPEAKER_08]: I have already tentatively accepted that with the Medford office of

554
00:53:01,532 --> 00:53:15,773
[SPEAKER_08]: uh sorry uh i believe preservation and development uh i might have gotten that wrong um so i have tentatively said yes i believe we will have enough people that is october 18th um unless i'm incorrect

555
00:53:16,634 --> 00:53:19,175
[SPEAKER_08]: We've shown up to this multiple times across the years.

556
00:53:19,435 --> 00:53:20,316
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great time.

557
00:53:20,336 --> 00:53:23,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I know I have attended it.

558
00:53:23,437 --> 00:53:28,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not sure if I will be able to attend this year.

559
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:38,464
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that was requested was that we show up with, and Ernie, this is like your time to shine, it was requested that we show up with bike lights.

560
00:53:38,624 --> 00:53:40,385
[SPEAKER_08]: This was something that they were,

561
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:42,907
[SPEAKER_08]: very energetic about.

562
00:53:43,107 --> 00:53:52,954
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we're able to show up and be able to distribute any bike light kits or other paraphernalia, I think there would be a very positive reception there.

563
00:53:53,335 --> 00:53:55,436
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's something that I believe that we should be doing.

564
00:53:55,456 --> 00:53:56,277
[SPEAKER_08]: I have already

565
00:53:58,118 --> 00:53:59,760
[SPEAKER_08]: effectively bookmarked our space.

566
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:05,264
[SPEAKER_08]: But if anyone is able to go and attend that, that would be wonderful.

567
00:54:05,404 --> 00:54:07,705
[SPEAKER_08]: It is 12 to 3 p.m.

568
00:54:08,046 --> 00:54:10,267
[SPEAKER_08]: It is at the infamous wind turbine.

569
00:54:10,608 --> 00:54:14,290
[SPEAKER_08]: I forget which school that is right on the back of.

570
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:19,554
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure someone can correct me faster than I can figure it out.

571
00:54:19,694 --> 00:54:21,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, but at Riverbend Park.

572
00:54:23,637 --> 00:54:26,518
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, that is the update I have there.

573
00:54:26,718 --> 00:54:27,718
[SPEAKER_08]: We are being requested.

574
00:54:28,998 --> 00:54:44,302
[SPEAKER_06]: In the past, we have said that we would assign an individual who would be responsible for making sure that everything's coordinated so that we don't have repeat of the circle square where either nobody shows up or the tent's not there.

575
00:54:44,702 --> 00:54:45,902
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have somebody on this?

576
00:54:46,202 --> 00:54:46,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that you?

577
00:54:46,903 --> 00:54:48,123
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that somebody else?

578
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:59,984
[SPEAKER_08]: I will need to defer to someone else as I have a lot of other things going on through September and October, along with other things that I need to follow up on.

579
00:55:00,144 --> 00:55:14,970
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would raise if anyone is willing to step up and take a position on driving our Harvester Energy Festival participation.

580
00:55:15,738 --> 00:55:29,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also really scattered in October, but I just wanted to say that even if you can't make it on that day, that's OK if you want to just be the person who makes sure everybody knows where they're going to be when.

581
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:37,717
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have to be able to be there on that day just to be the person to coordinate and make sure that somebody is there.

582
00:55:37,737 --> 00:55:41,200
[SPEAKER_08]: That is fair.

583
00:55:42,657 --> 00:55:46,098
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to suggest that maybe some of the newer people think about this.

584
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:50,059
[SPEAKER_08]: I see.

585
00:55:50,759 --> 00:55:52,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me recognize Ernie.

586
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:56,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just to follow up our emails.

587
00:55:56,461 --> 00:56:05,923
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I will be there in the early side of that time with 30 or more bike-like kits, I think.

588
00:56:06,924 --> 00:56:11,365
[SPEAKER_05]: But I can't commit to being there nor to setting up the table.

589
00:56:12,247 --> 00:56:17,091
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll certainly be part of the crew with the lights.

590
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:25,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone?

591
00:56:26,358 --> 00:56:26,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone?

592
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:32,462
[SPEAKER_08]: I can, if push comes to shove, I can try to coordinate it as best as I can.

593
00:56:32,482 --> 00:56:36,766
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm away that weekend.

594
00:56:36,786 --> 00:56:38,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll put you on that if needed.

595
00:56:39,991 --> 00:56:58,006
[SPEAKER_02]: The stuff from the farmer's market at my house still, so the table and the sign thing, and maybe there's like five light kits, so I can coordinate with whoever's coordinating, I guess, to hand that off and take it to wherever it needs to be before the event.

596
00:57:04,191 --> 00:57:07,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just heard and saw in the chat a lot of people say they're not going to be there.

597
00:57:08,013 --> 00:57:08,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not going to be there.

598
00:57:08,993 --> 00:57:11,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we know that we have enough people to staff it?

599
00:57:14,376 --> 00:57:15,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we just really need three.

600
00:57:16,437 --> 00:57:31,463
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm willing to staff it and be at the table, but I was being reluctant to coordinate it because we also have another event which I'm planning on coordinating, which we haven't talked about yet.

601
00:57:33,698 --> 00:57:37,139
[SPEAKER_06]: I would certainly be available to be at the, at the booth.

602
00:57:37,759 --> 00:57:38,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

603
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:43,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wanted to make sure that not the entire bike commission is gone the, on October 18th.

604
00:57:45,602 --> 00:57:47,202
[SPEAKER_03]: I may be able to be there.

605
00:57:47,342 --> 00:57:56,025
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, there's a whole bunch of moving parts in October and I'm not, um, I'm hesitant to come in.

606
00:57:56,865 --> 00:57:59,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can say, I, I cannot either.

607
00:57:59,326 --> 00:58:01,466
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a medical procedure.

608
00:58:01,526 --> 00:58:03,387
[SPEAKER_00]: I will be out of commission that weekend.

609
00:58:06,288 --> 00:58:07,308
[SPEAKER_09]: What do we got, Bruce?

610
00:58:08,869 --> 00:58:13,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Hang on one second before I get too committed about that.

611
00:58:14,571 --> 00:58:17,051
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, I'm good.

612
00:58:17,271 --> 00:58:17,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

613
00:58:19,272 --> 00:58:20,352
[SPEAKER_09]: So who's our three?

614
00:58:24,654 --> 00:58:25,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, what was that, Chris?

615
00:58:25,854 --> 00:58:26,574
[SPEAKER_09]: I missed that.

616
00:58:26,714 --> 00:58:27,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's our three?

617
00:58:27,415 --> 00:58:30,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Ernie said we need three to be there.

618
00:58:31,056 --> 00:58:32,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it's a good idea.

619
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:40,143
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess there are tentatives from Emily and possibly me.

620
00:58:41,763 --> 00:58:44,525
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to double check on that.

621
00:58:45,485 --> 00:58:51,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of had it in my head that there were other people who had said that they were available and it might be people who aren't here now.

622
00:58:53,690 --> 00:58:54,170
[SPEAKER_08]: Possible.

623
00:58:54,190 --> 00:59:00,994
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, there's other folks who aren't here.

624
00:59:01,894 --> 00:59:03,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Anna, did you have your hand up?

625
00:59:04,995 --> 00:59:08,141
[SPEAKER_01]: no i'm gonna i'm also i'm also out of town that week okay

626
00:59:12,667 --> 00:59:17,348
[SPEAKER_08]: In that case, I can offer to coordinate.

627
00:59:18,189 --> 00:59:22,870
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't offer to be present, though, if I am around that weekend.

628
00:59:24,531 --> 00:59:27,552
[SPEAKER_08]: October is going to be a bit of a chaotic month for me.

629
00:59:27,692 --> 00:59:33,213
[SPEAKER_08]: So I will do what I can, but I cannot promise my presence.

630
00:59:34,854 --> 00:59:38,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Regardless, I can coordinate that.

631
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:43,518
[SPEAKER_08]: remotely in lack of anything else.

632
00:59:46,981 --> 00:59:47,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Daniel.

633
00:59:50,844 --> 00:59:55,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Quick aside guys, do we have like a events calendar for the year?

634
00:59:55,087 --> 00:59:59,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it'd be kind of nice to know about events further in advance.

635
01:00:00,851 --> 01:00:05,115
[SPEAKER_09]: It'd be helpful to put them on the calendar and block

636
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,612
[SPEAKER_09]: block other stuff before things get busy, but.

637
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:11,634
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good call out.

638
01:00:12,514 --> 01:00:17,538
[SPEAKER_08]: I think normally things are brought up as we hear about them or are invited to them.

639
01:00:18,919 --> 01:00:28,045
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not sure if every... Our next meeting says our meeting is in March, if that helps.

640
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:30,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me take a look at that in a bit, Leah.

641
01:00:35,683 --> 01:00:49,818
[SPEAKER_08]: I think some of these, until they are officially scheduled by whatever entity is putting them on, it's hard to know, but we can possibly come up with a recurring calendar of events.

642
01:00:50,999 --> 01:00:57,266
[SPEAKER_08]: That is something that we could try and do, at least for things that are consistent.

643
01:00:58,408 --> 01:01:01,171
[SPEAKER_08]: which Harvester Energy, I believe, generally is.

644
01:01:01,251 --> 01:01:05,294
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if it's always on the same weekend in every October.

645
01:01:05,314 --> 01:01:06,856
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone recall?

646
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, go ahead, Chris.

647
01:01:13,902 --> 01:01:14,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

648
01:01:14,743 --> 01:01:15,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, it could be.

649
01:01:16,264 --> 01:01:17,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, it's always nice having the, like,

650
01:01:18,582 --> 01:01:23,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Google bike commission, Google calendar, where it just plugs in and it shows up.

651
01:01:23,124 --> 01:01:33,968
[SPEAKER_09]: But if that's too hard to do because dates aren't known, then even like a simple page on the website, like here's the annual events that we know about that happen every year.

652
01:01:33,988 --> 01:01:37,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Even if we don't have dates, you can plug them in for approximately when they occur.

653
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:40,731
[SPEAKER_09]: It might be nice for publicity as well to advertise things.

654
01:01:44,172 --> 01:01:45,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, at least note the month.

655
01:01:47,539 --> 01:01:53,322
[SPEAKER_05]: that they usually occur.

656
01:01:54,762 --> 01:01:58,904
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a person who's in charge of the website now, or is it still you, Daniel?

657
01:02:00,365 --> 01:02:03,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't even been updating it consistently.

658
01:02:03,106 --> 01:02:05,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I've got access to it.

659
01:02:06,028 --> 01:02:07,728
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd have to double check, but I think I do.

660
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I did at one point, but I don't know if I still do.

661
01:02:12,191 --> 01:02:14,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I do website maintenance for my job.

662
01:02:14,792 --> 01:02:16,273
[SPEAKER_01]: I maintain the website for my job.

663
01:02:16,313 --> 01:02:20,155
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that I would be happy to help with, depending on what platform we use.

664
01:02:22,396 --> 01:02:25,657
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's cheese.

665
01:02:25,957 --> 01:02:27,098
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

666
01:02:27,278 --> 01:02:28,378
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a UI.

667
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:32,420
[SPEAKER_08]: It is entirely like a graphical user interface.

668
01:02:33,881 --> 01:02:34,641
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very simple.

669
01:02:37,372 --> 01:02:49,479
[SPEAKER_08]: Anna, if you are interested in helping us with that, that was something that when I was secretary, I took on as part of the meeting minutes updates, but I never maintained anything else on the website.

670
01:02:49,999 --> 01:03:00,185
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're willing to help there, that would be wonderful because I know that it's something that has fallen off my radar recently.

671
01:03:00,205 --> 01:03:02,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I can help with that.

672
01:03:02,967 --> 01:03:04,608
[SPEAKER_08]: Anna, I can get to that to you offline.

673
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,951
[SPEAKER_02]: If you need another resource, I'm happy to help.

674
01:03:08,071 --> 01:03:10,652
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in my skill set as well.

675
01:03:10,672 --> 01:03:12,712
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

676
01:03:13,012 --> 01:03:16,574
[SPEAKER_06]: I can work with both of you and figure out what we want to do.

677
01:03:17,034 --> 01:03:19,215
[SPEAKER_06]: For me, it's mostly just been a matter of attention.

678
01:03:19,235 --> 01:03:26,517
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't even say bandwidth, but just getting my attention to think about what should we do and what changes need to be made.

679
01:03:27,077 --> 01:03:30,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So by having additional people doing that, I think that might be helpful.

680
01:03:32,139 --> 01:03:32,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that's great.

681
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,480
[SPEAKER_06]: We can just do that offline.

682
01:03:41,714 --> 01:03:45,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we need to move to form a web subcommittee or working group?

683
01:03:49,736 --> 01:03:50,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we just good?

684
01:03:51,096 --> 01:03:51,756
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're good.

685
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:52,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

686
01:03:53,377 --> 01:03:58,438
[SPEAKER_08]: I think this falls within standard maintenance and just maintaining.

687
01:04:00,422 --> 01:04:03,285
[SPEAKER_08]: At the moment, yeah, I concur.

688
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:05,768
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we need a working group for this.

689
01:04:08,831 --> 01:04:14,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, not to belabor that we've been on Harvester Energy Festival for probably far too long at this point.

690
01:04:16,259 --> 01:04:18,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Bruce, would you like to give a quick update on Tufts Community?

691
01:04:19,514 --> 01:04:27,118
[SPEAKER_06]: So I left a link in the agenda, which I will copy to the chat for everybody's edification.

692
01:04:28,278 --> 01:04:32,520
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's basically going to be on October the 5th from 11 to 2 PM.

693
01:04:33,141 --> 01:04:37,423
[SPEAKER_06]: They are looking for people to sign up, they say as soon as possible.

694
01:04:37,483 --> 01:04:43,666
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully we're not too late, but I would take the lead on that and get us there.

695
01:04:43,906 --> 01:04:46,127
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we are accepted,

696
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:48,547
[SPEAKER_06]: then organize for people to show up.

697
01:04:49,188 --> 01:04:54,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise I would just show up and I would volunteer to be the coordinator for that event as well.

698
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:56,849
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's assuming we want to do it.

699
01:04:57,069 --> 01:05:02,331
[SPEAKER_06]: So all we need is just approval for me to go ahead with it and I can take it from there.

700
01:05:03,491 --> 01:05:08,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I hear a motion to approve Bruce to be the head of that?

701
01:05:09,988 --> 01:05:15,280
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just like, what is what is like being there?

702
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,182
[SPEAKER_09]: What do I entail?

703
01:05:16,323 --> 01:05:17,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Same thing as we do at other.

704
01:05:18,503 --> 01:05:20,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's our basic table.

705
01:05:20,244 --> 01:05:21,304
[SPEAKER_06]: And we hang out at the table.

706
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:22,804
[SPEAKER_06]: People come and talk to us.

707
01:05:22,824 --> 01:05:25,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we have lights to give away, we do that.

708
01:05:27,566 --> 01:05:34,228
[SPEAKER_06]: I have in my head to get some better handout material or better program.

709
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:38,029
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know, Chris, you and I are on planning to get together.

710
01:05:38,049 --> 01:05:42,411
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, who else was the third person who was going to do that?

711
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:42,511
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam.

712
01:05:42,711 --> 01:05:42,931
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam.

713
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:45,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Adam.

714
01:05:46,847 --> 01:05:49,289
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Adam, OK, not on today.

715
01:05:49,869 --> 01:05:52,551
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyhow, where was I going with that?

716
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:59,495
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so basically, that's what we do at the tables, and answer questions that people might have.

717
01:05:59,555 --> 01:06:00,475
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you get places?

718
01:06:01,276 --> 01:06:02,617
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we doing about blah, blah, blah?

719
01:06:02,897 --> 01:06:04,398
[SPEAKER_06]: When does ClipperShipConnector open?

720
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:05,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Blah, blah, blah, that kind of things.

721
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:13,684
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think it will be more skewed towards students at Tufts, or just our general crowd?

722
01:06:14,492 --> 01:06:22,278
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a general crowd that when people show up, it's like literally a community day, and it's really more externally facing than internal for Tufts.

723
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:24,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

724
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:33,766
[SPEAKER_03]: When I did it a couple years ago, I saw a guy that I had met on my very first group ride 25 years ago.

725
01:06:38,355 --> 01:06:42,339
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I have also known him otherwise in between.

726
01:06:42,359 --> 01:06:44,581
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't like I just saw him that one time.

727
01:06:44,721 --> 01:06:49,346
[SPEAKER_03]: But he lives in Wellesley and was in town for the day and went to the thing.

728
01:06:49,466 --> 01:06:51,188
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's definitely not just a Tufts thing.

729
01:06:55,452 --> 01:06:55,892
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

730
01:06:57,334 --> 01:06:59,976
[SPEAKER_09]: That is one I might be able to attend if you need another person there.

731
01:06:59,996 --> 01:07:01,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Chris?

732
01:07:01,954 --> 01:07:07,895
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I will send out separately a call for volunteers as we get a little bit closer.

733
01:07:08,295 --> 01:07:13,296
[SPEAKER_06]: And assuming we get accepted, I do need to contact them, which we'll do in the next day or so.

734
01:07:14,437 --> 01:07:17,317
[SPEAKER_06]: So I heard a motion, I think.

735
01:07:18,277 --> 01:07:18,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Anna, that's right.

736
01:07:19,037 --> 01:07:20,298
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I had you named out for.

737
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:23,118
[SPEAKER_06]: One second.

738
01:07:24,679 --> 01:07:25,079
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

739
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:26,719
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're looking for a second, I think.

740
01:07:26,739 --> 01:07:28,179
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

741
01:07:29,060 --> 01:07:29,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded.

742
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:30,540
[SPEAKER_06]: Emily.

743
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:33,013
[SPEAKER_08]: All in favor?

744
01:07:33,593 --> 01:07:33,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

745
01:07:34,314 --> 01:07:34,414
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

746
01:07:34,574 --> 01:07:34,714
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

747
01:07:35,435 --> 01:07:35,575
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

748
01:07:36,416 --> 01:07:36,976
[SPEAKER_08]: All opposed?

749
01:07:38,237 --> 01:07:40,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Hearing none, the ayes have it.

750
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:41,961
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

751
01:07:44,623 --> 01:07:45,024
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

752
01:07:48,707 --> 01:07:52,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Ernie, bike lights report, if you can, in as few words as possible.

753
01:07:52,931 --> 01:07:54,953
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll try and catch back up with this schedule.

754
01:07:56,415 --> 01:07:57,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, we're running late.

755
01:07:57,575 --> 01:07:58,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Same with me too.

756
01:07:59,436 --> 01:08:02,496
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get through helmet distribution real fast if you can get through.

757
01:08:02,956 --> 01:08:04,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, well, it is quick.

758
01:08:05,137 --> 01:08:09,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for reaching out to Alicia to get an old invoice paid.

759
01:08:09,778 --> 01:08:10,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I've not heard from her.

760
01:08:11,598 --> 01:08:18,940
[SPEAKER_05]: You probably saw, well, last time we agreed that since we're running short on the League of Bicyclists,

761
01:08:21,273 --> 01:08:25,636
[SPEAKER_05]: American Bicyclists quick guide that we need to order some.

762
01:08:25,836 --> 01:08:31,680
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did earlier in the week after asking Alicia if she wanted to order them instead.

763
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:33,361
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't hear back from her.

764
01:08:34,042 --> 01:08:38,385
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just followed through on our agreement to purchase some.

765
01:08:39,285 --> 01:08:43,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Remarkably, they're arriving tomorrow, so 500 of them.

766
01:08:44,368 --> 01:08:57,776
[SPEAKER_05]: That'll take us through next year and allow Anna and I, in a couple weeks, to stuff the bike light kits now that the guides are in and the lights, as you know, have been here.

767
01:08:58,176 --> 01:09:05,601
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I will do to make this a little bit more expedient is combine the invoice

768
01:09:06,848 --> 01:09:32,082
[SPEAKER_05]: for next year's bike lights, which I paid for in April, with this $600 expense for the 500 quick guides, and ask JRA to submit that as a combined invoice to Alicia in the city, and hope that maybe by 2028, I will get paid.

769
01:09:37,401 --> 01:09:46,056
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Ernie would, would it make more sense to pay this out of the, uh, uh, and back, um,

770
01:09:47,568 --> 01:09:48,748
[SPEAKER_08]: checkbook effectively?

771
01:09:49,228 --> 01:09:50,069
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I don't know.

772
01:09:50,209 --> 01:09:57,010
[SPEAKER_05]: See, we talked about that briefly before as to who has money and who gets to control all this.

773
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:07,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Last time, I don't know how I was reimbursed, but I bought these booklets about two years ago.

774
01:10:07,212 --> 01:10:08,592
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe Emily remembers.

775
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:12,153
[SPEAKER_05]: And somehow I got reimbursed for that.

776
01:10:13,173 --> 01:10:16,896
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, with that, let me just see this.

777
01:10:17,037 --> 01:10:21,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily, do you have any updates on that particular portion?

778
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:35,652
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have updates, but just to answer the question about how they get paid for and why JRA is involved is that the city didn't want to go through for various reasons.

779
01:10:35,692 --> 01:10:37,093
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have that history.

780
01:10:38,174 --> 01:10:40,396
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, go ahead.

781
01:10:41,042 --> 01:10:49,426
[SPEAKER_03]: The city can only buy from approved vendors, and the cheap supplier in China is not one of those.

782
01:10:50,207 --> 01:10:55,089
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it goes through JRA, then JRA is an approved vendor.

783
01:10:55,829 --> 01:11:00,572
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why this whole thing, the whole operation gets done through JRA.

784
01:11:01,392 --> 01:11:13,889
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why the quick guides also would have to be, but if that if that expedites the process, then whether it comes out of the bike commission budget or not, it still gets paid for.

785
01:11:13,909 --> 01:11:17,814
[SPEAKER_03]: The money still gets paid to the same.

786
01:11:19,267 --> 01:11:23,512
[SPEAKER_03]: person or the same entity, regardless of which budget it comes out of.

787
01:11:23,932 --> 01:11:24,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

788
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:40,269
[SPEAKER_05]: The kink seems to be that Alicia does not want any funds dispersed to MBAC individual members, only to final invoicers.

789
01:11:41,362 --> 01:11:54,535
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why I think it may make sense to put the quick guides in on a JRA invoice, bumping that from $1,100 to $1,700 and getting her to pay for it once and for all.

790
01:11:54,555 --> 01:11:54,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Given that

791
01:12:05,332 --> 01:12:08,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Brookline Bank's giving us $500 this summer.

792
01:12:09,455 --> 01:12:24,643
[SPEAKER_05]: That means the net expense for all of the lights for next year and the quick guides will be $1,700 minus $500, so it'll be about $1,200, which is most of the budget.

793
01:12:25,523 --> 01:12:30,906
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I don't see that there is even a fixed $1,500 budget account

794
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:39,923
[SPEAKER_05]: in her purview that is monitored or balanced over a period of time.

795
01:12:40,323 --> 01:12:43,464
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems to be losing... Let's not worry about that, Ernie.

796
01:12:45,185 --> 01:12:49,207
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I know, but... I will raise this with Alicia directly.

797
01:12:49,227 --> 01:12:51,327
[SPEAKER_08]: I will follow up there.

798
01:12:51,948 --> 01:12:52,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

799
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:54,088
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, be curious.

800
01:12:54,148 --> 01:12:55,429
[SPEAKER_05]: She didn't respond, so...

801
01:12:56,693 --> 01:12:57,333
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize that.

802
01:12:59,293 --> 01:13:01,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I suspect there's a lot going on with Alicia.

803
01:13:01,614 --> 01:13:03,014
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree.

804
01:13:03,354 --> 01:13:06,375
[SPEAKER_08]: But nonetheless, leave that one with me.

805
01:13:07,215 --> 01:13:09,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm happy to follow up and make sure that you get reimbursed.

806
01:13:10,275 --> 01:13:15,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm in no rush for it because it's been, you know, over a year in one case.

807
01:13:15,836 --> 01:13:20,737
[SPEAKER_05]: But but it'd be good if it doesn't fall through the cracks forever.

808
01:13:20,757 --> 01:13:24,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I completely agree with that.

809
01:13:27,969 --> 01:13:38,014
[SPEAKER_08]: As an aside, the invoice with JRA required me to follow up with Alicia because they directly reached out to me because I know people at JRA.

810
01:13:38,134 --> 01:13:43,317
[SPEAKER_08]: So let me see what I can do about getting the finances sorted out.

811
01:13:44,657 --> 01:13:47,979
[SPEAKER_08]: But thank you for the update on that and continuing on.

812
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you've already sent me that invoice.

813
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:51,641
[SPEAKER_08]: I have it saved.

814
01:13:52,842 --> 01:13:58,327
[SPEAKER_08]: I will make that a particular point to follow up as just a natural part of being the chair.

815
01:13:58,368 --> 01:14:03,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we necessarily need a motion for me to follow up on our outstanding debts.

816
01:14:03,553 --> 01:14:03,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

817
01:14:04,033 --> 01:14:12,022
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a last sentence, it appears that with Anna's help in mid-September, we'll get a couple hundred of these.

818
01:14:14,072 --> 01:14:24,276
[SPEAKER_05]: bike light kits wrapped up and I should be able to distribute 150 or so to the schools by, let's say, the end of September for the fall season.

819
01:14:25,957 --> 01:14:26,377
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.

820
01:14:26,517 --> 01:14:26,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

821
01:14:27,497 --> 01:14:29,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Bernie?

822
01:14:29,558 --> 01:14:30,958
[SPEAKER_08]: Helmet distribution.

823
01:14:31,079 --> 01:14:31,679
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

824
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:36,421
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone have any comments on the bike lights or shall I move on to helmet distributions?

825
01:14:39,002 --> 01:14:39,362
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

826
01:14:41,548 --> 01:14:42,489
[SPEAKER_08]: helmet distributions.

827
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:48,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Sadly, um, Berkshire, white and Gluck or Berkshire, I've.

828
01:14:49,157 --> 01:14:49,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Breakstone.

829
01:14:49,978 --> 01:14:50,438
[SPEAKER_06]: Breakstone.

830
01:14:50,999 --> 01:14:51,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Breakstone.

831
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:51,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

832
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:59,328
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the B. I forgot the B. Um, Breakstone, white and Gluck has discontinued their helmet, um,

833
01:15:01,058 --> 01:15:03,699
[SPEAKER_08]: I did reach out to the individual who was originally there.

834
01:15:04,899 --> 01:15:05,880
[SPEAKER_08]: She has since left.

835
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:13,122
[SPEAKER_08]: She gave me some leads on the ability to buy helmets ourselves if we need that.

836
01:15:14,523 --> 01:15:20,705
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe she got something like 30 helmets for $500 for a program that she's currently running.

837
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:22,705
[SPEAKER_08]: She did give me those links.

838
01:15:23,325 --> 01:15:27,507
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's something that we may need to raise as

839
01:15:28,547 --> 01:15:35,650
[SPEAKER_08]: either finding a new corporate sponsor or coming up with the money to buy helmets ourselves.

840
01:15:36,890 --> 01:15:38,631
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is the update I have there.

841
01:15:42,113 --> 01:15:43,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Any comments on that?

842
01:15:43,073 --> 01:15:50,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I currently have enough things on my plate that trying to follow up with the helmets may be a bridge too far for me at this point.

843
01:15:52,077 --> 01:15:54,758
[SPEAKER_08]: But... I raise this.

844
01:15:54,838 --> 01:15:55,538
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Ernie.

845
01:15:59,382 --> 01:16:14,770
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately yeah i got it um i will tickle my contacts in uh hong kong about that because they had offered the lights people uh to to be able to get helmets i i

846
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:25,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Boy, doing due diligence on quality and all that would be awfully difficult if they're coming from China and maybe the shipping makes it nonsensical.

847
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:32,053
[SPEAKER_05]: But we know that good helmets that are approved by ASTM as well as

848
01:16:32,954 --> 01:16:42,497
[SPEAKER_05]: other regulatory bodies, you know, retail in the low 20s at Target and all kinds of places, and they're well-made.

849
01:16:42,517 --> 01:16:45,058
[SPEAKER_05]: Schwinn has their name on them, et cetera.

850
01:16:45,438 --> 01:16:51,800
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's the case, then they only cost in bulk $12 or $13 or $14 a piece.

851
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe that's not too far off from what you were quoted as $17.

852
01:16:57,760 --> 01:16:58,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Daniel.

853
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:06,684
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know how to, you know, go to a market and pick and choose what we like.

854
01:17:06,844 --> 01:17:12,967
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that what's his name, the Bridgestone people did pretty good job with whoever their source was.

855
01:17:13,387 --> 01:17:25,592
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the helmets we distributed were right on the money for quality and size distribution for all youth ages.

856
01:17:26,423 --> 01:17:28,824
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd love to be able to replicate that somehow.

857
01:17:29,365 --> 01:17:40,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if we try to find out from them who their source was, we wouldn't need special stenciling or ink on them or any of that personalization.

858
01:17:41,231 --> 01:17:50,156
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we can get this down below, let's say $15 per helmet, I think we should really try to attract some funding to do that.

859
01:17:51,608 --> 01:17:59,775
[SPEAKER_08]: No, what I'm hearing move, we're looking for, uh, per item piece below $15.

860
01:17:59,815 --> 01:18:02,917
[SPEAKER_08]: Ultimately.

861
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:05,840
[SPEAKER_08]: I would.

862
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:12,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, sorry, quick Google search helmets are us.

863
01:18:13,186 --> 01:18:17,630
[SPEAKER_09]: They've got a whole bunch of options that I'll meet the sort of us quality certs for under.

864
01:18:19,365 --> 01:18:20,205
[SPEAKER_09]: $12 each.

865
01:18:20,666 --> 01:18:26,008
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I should note that I think that that was one of the names that, uh, forget her name.

866
01:18:28,629 --> 01:18:34,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, but yes, that was a, that, that was a company that was raised to me.

867
01:18:35,112 --> 01:18:37,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Chris was his quantity under a hundred or 500.

868
01:18:39,113 --> 01:18:40,174
[SPEAKER_05]: What to get that?

869
01:18:40,354 --> 01:18:42,395
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see any quality requirements here.

870
01:18:42,415 --> 01:18:43,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, wow.

871
01:18:44,596 --> 01:18:44,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

872
01:18:45,456 --> 01:18:47,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just briefly searching right now, but.

873
01:18:48,844 --> 01:18:49,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, yeah.

874
01:18:49,664 --> 01:18:51,985
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like $10 for a single one.

875
01:18:53,085 --> 01:18:57,646
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for 500 for my own project from helmets RS.

876
01:19:00,087 --> 01:19:01,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, minimum order 24.

877
01:19:02,267 --> 01:19:03,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's easy.

878
01:19:05,628 --> 01:19:07,188
[SPEAKER_09]: And orders must be placed through an organization.

879
01:19:07,248 --> 01:19:10,929
[SPEAKER_09]: It says, but I think we need those.

880
01:19:12,493 --> 01:19:12,713
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

881
01:19:13,614 --> 01:19:21,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, at the moment, uh, I do not have the bandwidth with other things that I have on my plate.

882
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:30,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, is anyone willing to take this on, uh, possibly, you know, either a working group or individually?

883
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:33,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.

884
01:19:34,188 --> 01:19:36,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Working group, but not into it.

885
01:19:36,549 --> 01:19:37,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Not totally me.

886
01:19:39,043 --> 01:19:44,868
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to clarify, when you say take this on, like research and purchase by comments?

887
01:19:46,270 --> 01:19:53,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I think at the moment we probably want to do research and then we can approve the purchase at a future meeting.

888
01:19:53,416 --> 01:20:05,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess I'm happy to take it on, but I think some clarity around like who are we buying for and how many and any other sort of considerations to help.

889
01:20:07,444 --> 01:20:08,505
[SPEAKER_09]: spec out what we need?

890
01:20:10,325 --> 01:20:15,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I think at the moment, this is helmets for distribution at events.

891
01:20:16,648 --> 01:20:29,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Specifically, I think that Ernie has also raised that these might be presented to the police department as something to give out to kids when they have the opportunity to.

892
01:20:29,755 --> 01:20:31,155
[SPEAKER_08]: So that is

893
01:20:33,016 --> 01:20:43,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I think how we are envisioning them being used at the moment, sort of a giveaway to any particular individual.

894
01:20:43,483 --> 01:20:46,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, go ahead, Leah.

895
01:20:46,846 --> 01:20:53,671
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, it may also be worth mentioning that I think we've focused on

896
01:20:55,825 --> 01:21:05,456
[SPEAKER_04]: children-sized helmets in the past, just because the law in Massachusetts is that you're required to wear one if you're, like, 16 and under, I think.

897
01:21:05,897 --> 01:21:07,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Possibly under 16.

898
01:21:07,639 --> 01:21:09,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's our priority.

899
01:21:09,281 --> 01:21:10,743
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the glaring need.

900
01:21:13,823 --> 01:21:21,607
[SPEAKER_05]: And in terms of distribution, I mean, I'm going to distribute to the five schools twice a year.

901
01:21:22,107 --> 01:21:36,054
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty easy for me to fill the car with 150, 100 helmets at the same time and have distribution through the schools with a point person there who might do the fitting.

902
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:41,637
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we talked last time about how we should be responsible for fitting

903
01:21:42,252 --> 01:21:53,196
[SPEAKER_05]: helmets on kids, especially, and not just throwing them at them or having the police do so without at least some due diligence about proper fit.

904
01:21:54,996 --> 01:22:04,700
[SPEAKER_06]: So, again, this is working group stuff, I suppose, but... I'd like to move that we form that working group and appoint people to that group at this point.

905
01:22:05,327 --> 01:22:14,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Bruce, before we do that, I'd like to give Noam and then Jared an opportunity to weigh in here really quickly.

906
01:22:14,619 --> 01:22:20,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it proposed that the working group also is like trying to solicit a corporate underwriter for this?

907
01:22:20,707 --> 01:22:22,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that part of the scope?

908
01:22:23,056 --> 01:22:23,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

909
01:22:24,157 --> 01:22:36,765
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I do recall the Metro police has like their own supply of helmets they give out to like that big event they have at Hormel, you know, they're handing out helmets and I don't believe they came from us.

910
01:22:36,865 --> 01:22:40,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wonder if that's another line of inquiry as well.

911
01:22:40,648 --> 01:22:44,330
[SPEAKER_02]: But perhaps this is fodder for the working group.

912
01:22:47,497 --> 01:22:48,538
[SPEAKER_05]: are you joining the group?

913
01:22:48,798 --> 01:22:52,422
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm volunteering, I guess, to participate in the group as well.

914
01:22:52,842 --> 01:22:53,062
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

915
01:22:54,243 --> 01:22:59,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Jared.

916
01:22:59,488 --> 01:22:59,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

917
01:23:00,869 --> 01:23:01,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's there?

918
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:02,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

919
01:23:03,151 --> 01:23:04,172
[SPEAKER_07]: There we go.

920
01:23:04,232 --> 01:23:06,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Just following up on Noam's point there.

921
01:23:07,255 --> 01:23:12,320
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford family network, you know, as fodder for, for distribution, or for the working group, sorry.

922
01:23:13,482 --> 01:23:16,423
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford Family Network is probably a really good resource there.

923
01:23:16,684 --> 01:23:22,466
[SPEAKER_07]: They do not exclusively serve low-income families, but that's certainly a big part of their mission.

924
01:23:23,807 --> 01:23:31,690
[SPEAKER_07]: And it seems to me that that should be something that we're prioritizing as well, because those are the people who have the hardest time actually buying helmets for their kids.

925
01:23:32,911 --> 01:23:36,573
[SPEAKER_07]: So that seems like a very natural partnership for this sort of effort.

926
01:23:39,144 --> 01:23:49,026
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing organization if there's anyone on the phone who has not worked with them due to not having kids or just not really being into that or something.

927
01:23:49,207 --> 01:23:57,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, really wonderful nonprofit in Medford that beats the pants off of almost any nonprofit I've come across.

928
01:23:58,569 --> 01:23:59,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, really great organization.

929
01:24:00,469 --> 01:24:01,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Jared, I missed their name.

930
01:24:02,430 --> 01:24:02,990
[SPEAKER_05]: What's their name?

931
01:24:03,390 --> 01:24:04,890
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford Family Network.

932
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:06,611
[SPEAKER_07]: The Medford Family Network.

933
01:24:06,971 --> 01:24:07,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

934
01:24:08,282 --> 01:24:11,485
[SPEAKER_07]: Their office is in the high school building.

935
01:24:12,485 --> 01:24:14,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is a great, great group.

936
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:18,990
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

937
01:24:25,275 --> 01:24:25,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

938
01:24:26,476 --> 01:24:28,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Jared, I'm going to lower your hand.

939
01:24:31,883 --> 01:24:33,184
[SPEAKER_08]: There we go.

940
01:24:33,825 --> 01:24:37,068
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, so do I hear a motion to form this working group?

941
01:24:39,150 --> 01:24:52,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, just to clarify, the working group is to both determine a set of helmets to buy and to try and solicit a corporate sponsor.

942
01:24:52,542 --> 01:24:58,147
[SPEAKER_08]: This may not necessarily enable the group to purchase helmets on the behalf

943
01:24:59,087 --> 01:25:05,491
[SPEAKER_08]: of MBAC that may have to come to in a separate vote just due to budget constraints, I believe.

944
01:25:06,192 --> 01:25:09,373
[SPEAKER_08]: So those are the limits of the working group.

945
01:25:10,894 --> 01:25:17,899
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess, Bruce, I think if your motion, I assume your motion still stands with those limitations.

946
01:25:17,939 --> 01:25:18,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's fine.

947
01:25:19,259 --> 01:25:20,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

948
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:20,900
[SPEAKER_08]: Do I hear a second?

949
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:23,042
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

950
01:25:23,442 --> 01:25:23,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

951
01:25:24,883 --> 01:25:26,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Please raise your hand when you second, so I can tell who did it.

952
01:25:27,652 --> 01:25:28,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

953
01:25:28,353 --> 01:25:31,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Chris.

954
01:25:31,315 --> 01:25:31,995
[SPEAKER_08]: All in favor.

955
01:25:32,015 --> 01:25:32,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

956
01:25:33,777 --> 01:25:33,877

01:25:38,721 --> 01:25:38,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

973
01:25:39,141 --> 01:25:39,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

974
01:25:39,481 --> 01:25:39,581
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

975
01:25:39,602 --> 01:25:39,702
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

976
01:25:39,842 --> 01:25:39,962
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

977
01:25:40,002 --> 01:25:40,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

978
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:40,762
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

979
01:25:40,782 --> 01:25:41,403
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

01:25:41,763 --> 01:25:41,843
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

982
01:25:41,883 --> 01:25:42,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

983
01:25:42,103 --> 01:25:42,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

984
01:25:42,264 --> 01:25:42,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

985
01:25:42,544 --> 01:25:42,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

986
01:25:42,704 --> 01:25:42,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

987
01:25:42,844 --> 01:25:42,964

[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1062
01:25:57,448 --> 01:25:57,928
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

1063
01:25:59,649 --> 01:26:00,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Moving on.

1064
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:02,911
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless there are any other comments.

1065
01:26:03,552 --> 01:26:05,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Clipper ship connector access.

1066
01:26:07,075 --> 01:26:12,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess since we don't have Todd here, I will have to follow up and see what's happened to Todd.

1067
01:26:12,939 --> 01:26:15,481
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize he's been a little MIA recently.

1068
01:26:19,634 --> 01:26:35,262
[SPEAKER_08]: uh i think it's worth noting that the way finding signs did get out emily if you would like to make any comment on that feel free to um and aside from that i have nothing else i think i basically i said what there was to say about that that was just that we

1069
01:26:36,423 --> 01:26:40,866
[SPEAKER_03]: went out and did it, that it's better than nothing.

1070
01:26:42,347 --> 01:26:43,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's nice.

1071
01:26:43,428 --> 01:27:00,040
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be good to mention that we had to go out and put these plastic signs up with a special grant and volunteer help, because it wasn't part of the original planning of the project, like it really should have been all along for the 10 years that that was planned.

1072
01:27:01,461 --> 01:27:04,062
[SPEAKER_03]: So all I would say about that is,

1073
01:27:05,183 --> 01:27:28,517
[SPEAKER_03]: next time there's another bike path project, another DCR project, another connections project, even just improvements or updates or repairs to existing path networks, this would be a reason to say, hey, remember how we went out and put up quick and dirty plastic signs with volunteer help because it turned out that they were important

1074
01:27:30,332 --> 01:27:45,086
[SPEAKER_03]: I do remember, I do remember asking about wayfinding in a public meeting about the Clippership connector, something like eight or 10 years ago, back when such things were all in person, and we'd never heard of Zoom.

1075
01:27:46,007 --> 01:27:53,955
[SPEAKER_03]: And the person who I don't even remember who it was from DCR saying, oh, we have these granite pillars and you can't miss them.

1076
01:27:56,049 --> 01:27:59,051
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know how useful they are for getting you across Medford Square.

1077
01:27:59,531 --> 01:28:03,293
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's all to say, it's great that we have them.

1078
01:28:03,413 --> 01:28:04,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really glad that we did it.

1079
01:28:04,954 --> 01:28:09,756
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that next time we can point to it and say, let's plan it in the first place.

1080
01:28:09,876 --> 01:28:14,279
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't have to be a separate quick and dirty thing after the fact.

1081
01:28:14,779 --> 01:28:15,099
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all.

1082
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:16,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Noted.

1083
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:17,600
[SPEAKER_08]: Bruce?

1084
01:28:18,281 --> 01:28:21,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I went through there, I think, after the signs were put up.

1085
01:28:23,320 --> 01:28:31,006
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got to say that I don't remember there being a kind of continuous path as to how to do things.

1086
01:28:31,166 --> 01:28:33,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I missed a sign or maybe someone pulled down.

1087
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:45,957
[SPEAKER_03]: We did walk through and there is, I'm pretty sure there is a continuous method or there was when we put them up.

1088
01:28:46,337 --> 01:28:55,160
[SPEAKER_06]: It could be that because I was on my bike and perhaps going faster than a pedestrian would be, I bypassed some of them without realizing it.

1089
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:57,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, we did our best.

1090
01:28:58,341 --> 01:29:02,044
[SPEAKER_03]: We had to put them on, you know, on posts and poles that are there already.

1091
01:29:02,064 --> 01:29:08,668
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have to be above a certain height because otherwise, like, people, you hit them.

1092
01:29:09,169 --> 01:29:14,993
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's definitely some of those locations were definitely things like, I know that at that height, I would miss it.

1093
01:29:17,134 --> 01:29:21,959
[SPEAKER_03]: But then Todd was standing there being like, oh, my head is almost hitting this.

1094
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:27,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Or at one point, I rode my bike past standing up.

1095
01:29:28,424 --> 01:29:32,508
[SPEAKER_03]: And oh, this is high enough that I would probably miss it.

1096
01:29:33,229 --> 01:29:35,551
[SPEAKER_03]: But I can hit my head if I'm out of this.

1097
01:29:35,891 --> 01:29:41,996
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll endeavor to do another survey at some point in the next week or two, just as I go through that area to see.

1098
01:29:43,375 --> 01:29:46,797
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe some have come down or if either suggestions.

1099
01:29:46,957 --> 01:29:52,200
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I'm sure they also like get loose and rotate around the poles and stuff.

1100
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:54,322
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just zip tied plastic.

1101
01:29:54,882 --> 01:29:55,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for the effort.

1102
01:29:56,323 --> 01:30:01,066
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, you know, hopefully we can hopefully we can get something better in the future.

1103
01:30:04,908 --> 01:30:05,909
[SPEAKER_08]: With that, Jared.

1104
01:30:07,665 --> 01:30:07,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1105
01:30:07,805 --> 01:30:09,146
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had a quick question.

1106
01:30:09,206 --> 01:30:11,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for putting those, those signs up.

1107
01:30:11,529 --> 01:30:15,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I, I wrote that the other week for the first time and it was such a, such a nice path.

1108
01:30:15,913 --> 01:30:22,018
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but, um, yeah, I lost the, I tried to follow the signage, but I, I think I deviated.

1109
01:30:22,038 --> 01:30:28,624
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wasn't sure, uh, what the final route was when you're, when you're East bounds, like.

1110
01:30:29,785 --> 01:30:37,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Emily, do you stay on Clippership and then go all the way to Maine and take the sidewalks up and then kind of make a U-turn there?

1111
01:30:37,652 --> 01:30:39,914
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, both directions you pick your way through the crosswalks.

1112
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:41,155
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're heading eastbound, I think you

1113
01:30:52,893 --> 01:31:09,719
[SPEAKER_03]: cross at the, you cross at the pedestrian crossing that's closer to the Condon Shell, and then you're on that side of the street, and then you go through that area that apparently is called Sleepy Hollow.

1114
01:31:09,739 --> 01:31:18,201
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in the other direction, you cross at that pedestrian signal that nobody stops for, and

1115
01:31:20,335 --> 01:31:25,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're on the same side as the Condon shell.

1116
01:31:27,101 --> 01:31:28,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Or maybe I have that backwards.

1117
01:31:28,783 --> 01:31:29,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

1118
01:31:29,443 --> 01:31:30,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's flipped.

1119
01:31:30,685 --> 01:31:31,045
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's.

1120
01:31:32,806 --> 01:31:33,307
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

1121
01:31:33,327 --> 01:31:39,953
[SPEAKER_07]: What about, sorry, at Clippership and Maine specifically, if you're going westbound?

1122
01:31:41,283 --> 01:31:49,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the approach you take clipper ship, but into Maine and then turn right to filter up through the crosswalks and then yeah.

1123
01:31:49,389 --> 01:31:52,591
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the moment you're, you're doing that on the sidewalk.

1124
01:31:53,407 --> 01:31:53,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1125
01:31:53,727 --> 01:31:53,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1126
01:31:54,087 --> 01:32:08,792
[SPEAKER_03]: And there, and I think Todd told us that there will be, or possibly this is still a possibility and not a definite thing that there may be a bike signal so that you can actually just take a left on main from Clippership.

1127
01:32:09,912 --> 01:32:12,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, if you're heading westbound.

1128
01:32:15,934 --> 01:32:17,175
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just a possibility.

1129
01:32:17,235 --> 01:32:17,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Isn't that.

1130
01:32:18,087 --> 01:32:20,348
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he told us that that was going to happen.

1131
01:32:20,408 --> 01:32:25,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know a particular timeline for that, but that's, it's not like, it's not there yet.

1132
01:32:25,830 --> 01:32:35,975
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the moment, for the time being, you have to go through the, um, you just go through the crosswalks and there are signs asking you to pretty please dismount while you're in the business district.

1133
01:32:36,835 --> 01:32:40,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, otherwise it asks to yield to pedestrians while on the sidewalk.

1134
01:32:46,982 --> 01:32:56,285
[SPEAKER_07]: If only we had had some warning that this project was coming so we could have handled this in advance If only oh boy Well, thank you.

1135
01:32:56,325 --> 01:33:06,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for your effort All right, um

1136
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:08,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1137
01:33:08,410 --> 01:33:09,591
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Emily.

1138
01:33:09,871 --> 01:33:13,052
[SPEAKER_08]: I very much appreciate you taking that on.

1139
01:33:13,212 --> 01:33:19,234
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it was mostly you and I was like in Sweden while that happened.

1140
01:33:19,254 --> 01:33:19,954
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good excuse.

1141
01:33:20,014 --> 01:33:25,817
[SPEAKER_08]: I could have helped you otherwise, but I was all around better biking infrastructure.

1142
01:33:25,837 --> 01:33:33,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was honestly, we had plenty of people and it was like more people than really necessary to do this job, but

1143
01:33:35,301 --> 01:33:38,602
[SPEAKER_03]: It got done, and it got done within the scheduled time.

1144
01:33:38,622 --> 01:33:43,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah.

1145
01:33:43,823 --> 01:33:57,166
[SPEAKER_08]: Is it worth us trying to bring this up with the, I guess, the contraflow bike lane, the approved contraflow bike lane along Riverside Ave?

1146
01:33:58,546 --> 01:33:59,426
[SPEAKER_03]: You mean Clippership Ave?

1147
01:33:59,606 --> 01:34:00,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Clippership.

1148
01:34:00,026 --> 01:34:01,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Clippership Ave.

1149
01:34:01,106 --> 01:34:01,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Clippership Drive.

1150
01:34:02,687 --> 01:34:03,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Clippership Drive, yes.

1151
01:34:04,947 --> 01:34:06,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I thought that was Riverside there.

1152
01:34:11,772 --> 01:34:24,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not, I mean, if they, the signage will have to be changed if that exists, but, but that's, I don't know what else there is to this.

1153
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:32,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this particular thing was actually spearheaded by Carl Alexander with Myra and, or MWRA.

1154
01:34:34,180 --> 01:34:38,402
[SPEAKER_03]: and Mystic, M-R-W-A, whatever.

1155
01:34:42,644 --> 01:34:48,926
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this was the, not Massachusetts Water Resources, Mystic River Watershed Association.

1156
01:34:53,408 --> 01:34:54,669
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think they had made

1157
01:34:57,634 --> 01:34:59,734
[SPEAKER_03]: in order for a specific number of signs.

1158
01:34:59,774 --> 01:35:00,995
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there are any left.

1159
01:35:01,315 --> 01:35:01,855
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

1160
01:35:01,875 --> 01:35:03,695
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think there are any left.

1161
01:35:05,155 --> 01:35:07,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So it would be another whole thing.

1162
01:35:08,976 --> 01:35:10,476
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not a complicated thing.

1163
01:35:10,496 --> 01:35:15,617
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not that expensive, and it doesn't take very long to go and stick out a couple more.

1164
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:18,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Noted.

1165
01:35:22,098 --> 01:35:22,959
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1166
01:35:27,156 --> 01:35:30,038
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, again, thank you for your efforts there.

1167
01:35:30,999 --> 01:35:34,121
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully those get updated at some point in the future as well.

1168
01:35:34,781 --> 01:35:49,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think the hope is that if nothing else, when MassDOT does their big project on Main Street, between Main Street and Mystic Ave, there will be a crosswalk and a signal

1169
01:35:51,643 --> 01:36:00,007
[SPEAKER_03]: at the South Street end of the Craddock Bridge, at which point you won't have to pick your way up into the square and you can actually cross the street there.

1170
01:36:00,027 --> 01:36:06,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Remind me of the timing of that?

1171
01:36:06,109 --> 01:36:08,390
[SPEAKER_08]: That's two years ago?

1172
01:36:08,910 --> 01:36:09,431
[SPEAKER_08]: Two years.

1173
01:36:09,631 --> 01:36:10,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Approximately two years.

1174
01:36:12,152 --> 01:36:13,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Something like that.

1175
01:36:14,093 --> 01:36:17,134
[SPEAKER_08]: We're running a little bit behind.

1176
01:36:17,794 --> 01:36:18,675
[SPEAKER_08]: If there are any other

1177
01:36:21,149 --> 01:36:28,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, comments, I'm happy to take them, but we should also note that we're well, I'm sure many people here would like to.

1178
01:36:30,405 --> 01:36:32,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Move along with at least some of these points.

1179
01:36:34,551 --> 01:36:34,952
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1180
01:36:36,701 --> 01:36:38,802
[SPEAKER_08]: will do in that case.

1181
01:36:38,902 --> 01:36:42,464
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold on, sorry, getting back to the agenda.

1182
01:36:43,024 --> 01:36:44,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Infrastructure updates.

1183
01:36:46,426 --> 01:36:48,447
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we need to belabor this point.

1184
01:36:49,687 --> 01:36:51,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask the city to add, see, click, fix.

1185
01:36:51,788 --> 01:36:55,650
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something that I have not done yet, but will be doing in the future.

1186
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:58,311
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't think we need a discussion point on that.

1187
01:37:01,473 --> 01:37:04,954
[SPEAKER_08]: For Salem, Riverside, Main High intersection work.

1188
01:37:07,008 --> 01:37:11,129
[SPEAKER_08]: Jared, is this the one that I was referring to earlier?

1189
01:37:11,149 --> 01:37:13,309
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this may not be.

1190
01:37:13,589 --> 01:37:13,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1191
01:37:13,889 --> 01:37:13,929
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1192
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:16,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what they did there.

1193
01:37:16,110 --> 01:37:17,310
[SPEAKER_06]: They said they were going to do it.

1194
01:37:17,430 --> 01:37:22,251
[SPEAKER_06]: There was some modification of the islands planned, but it was not a major thing.

1195
01:37:23,571 --> 01:37:24,112
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, Jared.

1196
01:37:24,132 --> 01:37:24,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1197
01:37:24,632 --> 01:37:26,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Why are you listed as the person?

1198
01:37:26,612 --> 01:37:28,392
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just trying to remember.

1199
01:37:28,412 --> 01:37:35,554
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was because I saw a social media post about it and was otherwise unaware.

1200
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:38,960
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1201
01:37:39,581 --> 01:37:41,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't even aware of this either.

1202
01:37:45,526 --> 01:37:51,752
[SPEAKER_08]: It may be worth noting that this is something we should probably bring up in our next meeting, which is not going to be all that far away.

1203
01:37:51,772 --> 01:37:53,874
[SPEAKER_08]: I will note.

1204
01:37:55,675 --> 01:38:04,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Unless people have a burning desire to discuss this here, I would propose that we table this for the next meeting.

1205
01:38:05,629 --> 01:38:07,893
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine, I think we can do that for when Todd's here.

1206
01:38:08,193 --> 01:38:13,862
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we had pushed some of the Mystic Valley Parkway repainting discussion to this agenda item.

1207
01:38:14,483 --> 01:38:16,746
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did have some comments I wanted to make in that area.

1208
01:38:17,583 --> 01:38:21,084
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I am happy to bring those up as well.

1209
01:38:21,144 --> 01:38:25,386
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to add that to the end after.

1210
01:38:26,446 --> 01:38:35,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I was quite surprised when I saw the ghosts getting painted prior to the actual painting, because I was not aware that there were going to be any changes.

1211
01:38:35,589 --> 01:38:39,911
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't see any requests for comments, anything of that sort.

1212
01:38:39,951 --> 01:38:45,393
[SPEAKER_06]: So it was really kind of a blindsiding, in my opinion, of the public with regard to

1213
01:38:46,031 --> 01:38:47,352
[SPEAKER_06]: painting what they painted there.

1214
01:38:48,252 --> 01:38:50,414
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've got to say, frankly, it's substandard.

1215
01:38:51,114 --> 01:39:00,279
[SPEAKER_06]: It does not adhere to many of the guidelines, particularly with regard to entering rotaries, traffic circles and the like.

1216
01:39:01,300 --> 01:39:04,222
[SPEAKER_06]: The bike lanes supposedly that went across the bridge,

1217
01:39:05,150 --> 01:39:11,612
[SPEAKER_06]: basically doesn't have any provisions for crossing straight onto Medford Street going into Arlington.

1218
01:39:12,132 --> 01:39:15,292
[SPEAKER_06]: All it does is turn you to the right at Mystic Valley Parkway.

1219
01:39:16,033 --> 01:39:18,233
[SPEAKER_06]: So it makes it kind of difficult.

1220
01:39:18,293 --> 01:39:25,395
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple of things it does, it discourages lane control, which is vitally important if you're going to be riding right through a rotary.

1221
01:39:26,515 --> 01:39:32,676
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of makes the assumption that you're going to get off and ride through the crosswalk or dismount, et cetera.

1222
01:39:32,957 --> 01:39:34,537
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just think that it was,

1223
01:39:35,697 --> 01:39:39,220
[SPEAKER_06]: was done hastily and without sufficient input from stakeholders.

1224
01:39:40,481 --> 01:39:41,782
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with that statement.

1225
01:39:42,203 --> 01:39:49,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I guess I'm sort of acting out of... Sorry, I'll finish my point really quickly, Emily, and then I'll hand it off.

1226
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:52,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I agree with all of those statements.

1227
01:39:53,291 --> 01:39:57,474
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that we might want to think about reaching out to who I believe is

1228
01:39:58,235 --> 01:40:05,842
[SPEAKER_08]: sadly, DCR, and raise with them that the design of this rotary is suboptimal.

1229
01:40:06,703 --> 01:40:19,676
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would suggest that we possibly get the weight of the MBAC commission to write a letter to them and possibly see if we can't get the rest of the city to push on that point.

1230
01:40:20,116 --> 01:40:20,737
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Emily.

1231
01:40:22,093 --> 01:40:26,582
[SPEAKER_03]: I was going to say I, I, I agree with what Bruce said about this.

1232
01:40:26,603 --> 01:40:31,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is one of those one of those cases where we need to.

1233
01:40:33,710 --> 01:40:36,831
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get on top of this as quickly as we can.

1234
01:40:36,851 --> 01:40:47,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's having just been yelled at for not using a bike lane three times in the last two days, now that there's, you know, students back in town.

1235
01:40:47,974 --> 01:40:55,176
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if that's why, but this is a case where we're only setting up everybody for more friction.

1236
01:40:55,596 --> 01:40:59,157
[SPEAKER_03]: If we make it look like the bike lane is where you're supposed to be,

1237
01:41:00,257 --> 01:41:07,783
[SPEAKER_03]: while also creating a situation where that's not actually a safe place to be if you're trying to go straight across the intersection.

1238
01:41:08,444 --> 01:41:24,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So my first suggestion is that, if nothing else, if there's a bike lane that looks like it only goes right and there's not a provision for going straight, at the very least, we should have sharrows that go immediately through the middle of the lane and through the middle of the rotary.

1239
01:41:28,300 --> 01:41:45,277
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's possible to configure it in a way that looks like slowing down stopping and using the crosswalk is an acceptable way to get across on a bike and also going straight through the rotary like a vehicle is an acceptable way to get through on a bike.

1240
01:41:46,177 --> 01:41:49,561
[SPEAKER_03]: But making it look like bikes just turn off to the right and then disappear is

1241
01:41:52,103 --> 01:42:06,375
[SPEAKER_03]: is really pretty counterproductive and it just contributes to the kinds of harassment that we've been complaining about because it makes it look like when you don't use that bike lane that you're doing something that you're not supposed to do.

1242
01:42:07,215 --> 01:42:12,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it encourages bicyclists to do something that's not necessarily safe

1243
01:42:14,689 --> 01:42:30,321
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if they decline to use this facility that's not really safe for making a maneuver that they want to make, then that gets lumped in with the running of red lights as bicyclists don't want to follow the rules and don't want to do what they're supposed to do.

1244
01:42:30,742 --> 01:42:33,624
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that that's a misconception, but it's a common misconception.

1245
01:42:34,164 --> 01:42:39,689
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're just inviting more friction when we have things that look like this.

1246
01:42:43,066 --> 01:42:48,055
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, Jared, and then Ernie, and then Leah.

1247
01:42:48,415 --> 01:42:56,469
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I was looking at maps before, but just to confirm, we're talking right now about High Street, the two rotaries that turn into Medford Street and Arlington?

1248
01:42:57,114 --> 01:42:57,614
[SPEAKER_06]: That's correct.

1249
01:42:58,415 --> 01:42:59,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1250
01:42:59,075 --> 01:43:01,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So apologies.

1251
01:43:01,377 --> 01:43:21,552
[SPEAKER_07]: My memory, I feel like is not what it used to be, but did, but did we not review plans for this redesign maybe a year or two ago and provide comments on that topic where like Bruce, I remember comments from you about it being too, you know, putting, making bikes feel more like pedestrians.

1252
01:43:21,652 --> 01:43:26,215
[SPEAKER_07]: And I remember a variety of comments that we not submit comments about this project that.

1253
01:43:26,555 --> 01:43:30,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so I do, I do remember that discussion.

1254
01:43:30,738 --> 01:43:35,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, that was not the, um, implemented design.

1255
01:43:35,242 --> 01:43:43,888
[SPEAKER_08]: The design that we commented on was a much more complete design, which I think we pushed back against.

1256
01:43:43,988 --> 01:43:50,093
[SPEAKER_08]: This seems to be some sort of what looks like a temporary repainting of the lanes.

1257
01:43:52,592 --> 01:43:53,994
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I was going to ask about too.

1258
01:43:54,054 --> 01:44:00,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I think what Chris put in the chat is like more of a long term vision for this thing.

1259
01:44:00,740 --> 01:44:05,805
[SPEAKER_04]: But does anyone have any pictures or is there any way to look at what's actually out there now?

1260
01:44:06,521 --> 01:44:08,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I can get you guys a picture probably tomorrow.

1261
01:44:09,263 --> 01:44:13,145
[SPEAKER_04]: I just kind of have no idea what we're talking about in this discussion.

1262
01:44:13,185 --> 01:44:13,886
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all just white.

1263
01:44:13,906 --> 01:44:14,526
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no other.

1264
01:44:14,546 --> 01:44:20,189
[SPEAKER_09]: There's bike lanes painted around both rotaries and along the side.

1265
01:44:20,269 --> 01:44:25,212
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, I could probably get you a photo tomorrow.

1266
01:44:25,293 --> 01:44:31,256
[SPEAKER_06]: This link that was provided is basically for the paths and not so much for the rotary, it looks like.

1267
01:44:31,276 --> 01:44:31,316
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1268
01:44:33,248 --> 01:44:37,529
[SPEAKER_09]: Go to page 32, they've got proposed design for the 2 rows.

1269
01:44:37,989 --> 01:44:39,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, this is my memory.

1270
01:44:39,550 --> 01:44:42,971
[SPEAKER_09]: This is this is, I believe it's part of the comprehensive, like, minimum and domestic.

1271
01:44:45,692 --> 01:44:56,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Path, so just to clarify for Leah, so the redesign, yeah, on this side of high street.

1272
01:44:56,695 --> 01:44:58,835
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I do remember this 1. yeah.

1273
01:44:58,855 --> 01:44:59,036
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1274
01:44:59,056 --> 01:44:59,196
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1275
01:44:59,216 --> 01:45:00,276
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not what was implemented.

1276
01:45:00,969 --> 01:45:14,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Right so the rotary ends up, there are painted lanes going in here but there's a and there's a new bike lane that either goes up mystic Valley Parkway but shows no provisions for continuing straight on high street.

1277
01:45:17,676 --> 01:45:42,229
[SPEAKER_08]: uh vehicle lane ends up having a yield sign right here or sorry painted yield markers on the ground right about here and then can continue through but the bike lane continues up this way then there is another bike lane that comes south along mystic valley parkway goes across high street and simply continues up north on mystic valley parkway and provides no provisions for going straight

1278
01:45:42,929 --> 01:45:52,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all of this has been repainted to reduce the radius of the rotary and reinforce the current paint markings here.

1279
01:45:52,874 --> 01:46:08,261
[SPEAKER_08]: So the problem is that we end up having sort of a bike lane that ultimately you can either go up Mystic Valley Parkway or down Mystic Valley Parkway and then back up it and no ability to continue from High Street to Medford Street.

1280
01:46:09,331 --> 01:46:09,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotcha.

1281
01:46:10,011 --> 01:46:10,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1282
01:46:10,891 --> 01:46:12,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Just for clarification.

1283
01:46:12,092 --> 01:46:13,792
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, we will get.

1284
01:46:16,733 --> 01:46:16,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

1285
01:46:17,073 --> 01:46:17,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1286
01:46:17,373 --> 01:46:17,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Ernie.

1287
01:46:18,793 --> 01:46:19,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1288
01:46:19,313 --> 01:46:33,977
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to be hopeful in that we will eventually have a dedicated bike line, a bike lane painted green, maybe with some separation.

1289
01:46:34,909 --> 01:46:39,893
[SPEAKER_05]: running west from West Medford Square to this rotary.

1290
01:46:40,614 --> 01:46:50,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's important that that be completely continuous with whatever is done to cross the rotary on DCR's turf.

1291
01:46:52,162 --> 01:47:08,475
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, we're nowhere near that, but we can at least complain about the fact that the current design is discontinuous with what we are going to be planning on the Medford side.

1292
01:47:09,425 --> 01:47:29,374
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to take a long view of this, hopefully not too long, and see that we would have, you know, maybe a green path going west on 60 through the rotary and continuing over the bridge to the other side.

1293
01:47:30,287 --> 01:47:46,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether or not there is a dedicated bike lane going east over the bridge, because that's DCR's turf, is immaterial and I guess would be up to them.

1294
01:47:47,130 --> 01:47:59,153
[SPEAKER_05]: But if we're going to have a dedicated bike lane from West Medford Square through to Arlington, we should make sure that whatever we control seems continuous, efficient, and safe.

1295
01:48:01,924 --> 01:48:13,854
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the big problem with the current design and where I'm afraid this is going to go is it basically provides, there's two ways for cyclists to safely get through this intersection.

1296
01:48:13,874 --> 01:48:26,465
[SPEAKER_06]: One is by merging with traffic that might be wanting to turn right or effectively controlling the lane as you do so and proceeding through the rotary as a vehicle.

1297
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:47,070
[SPEAKER_06]: The other option is to be shunted basically off to the crosswalk, but because of the nature of where those crosswalks are, that's an incredibly non-efficient mechanism for most cyclists, especially if you're coming down the hill from Arlington into the rotary, you have substantial speed at that point coming through.

1298
01:48:47,090 --> 01:48:50,912
[SPEAKER_06]: At least any non-trivial cyclist will have that.

1299
01:48:51,593 --> 01:48:56,876
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really becomes a question of making sure that motor traffic that's turning right

1300
01:48:57,856 --> 01:49:01,018
[SPEAKER_06]: is aware that there are cyclists potentially continuing straight.

1301
01:49:01,838 --> 01:49:17,968
[SPEAKER_06]: And whether that's done with signage or paint markings or whatever, that in my opinion is the biggest issue that needs to be faced because this rotary serves a fair number of what I refer to as fairly experienced cyclists.

1302
01:49:18,968 --> 01:49:19,489
[SPEAKER_06]: It also

1303
01:49:20,864 --> 01:49:23,006
[SPEAKER_06]: is kind of trepidation for those who are not.

1304
01:49:23,766 --> 01:49:47,322
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's fine to provide a pedestrian-like approach through here for those cyclists who don't want to ride it, but not at the expense of making it more dangerous or more confrontational for cyclists who are competent and are willing to ride through with traffic, which is probably most of us here.

1305
01:49:48,002 --> 01:49:54,163
[SPEAKER_06]: with the exception of maybe some of us when we're using a larger bike that's heavy and so on.

1306
01:49:54,183 --> 01:49:59,984
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's my comment about that and why I'm concerned with what is there now, similar to what Emily said.

1307
01:50:01,665 --> 01:50:05,486
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to just add my weight to that comment as well, Bruce.

1308
01:50:05,646 --> 01:50:12,727
[SPEAKER_08]: I cycle through this intersection, as does my partner, as does several people that I know on a very regular basis.

1309
01:50:14,327 --> 01:50:17,128
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, I concur with you.

1310
01:50:18,202 --> 01:50:26,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and if any of you have ridden through the rotary at Powder House Square along the bike path, it's horrible.

1311
01:50:26,808 --> 01:50:27,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1312
01:50:27,248 --> 01:50:27,668
[SPEAKER_09]: Miserable.

1313
01:50:27,908 --> 01:50:32,992
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's really hard to do the almost U-turn look over your shoulder as you're going across those.

1314
01:50:33,032 --> 01:50:33,512
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't do it.

1315
01:50:33,632 --> 01:50:34,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I just ride with traffic there.

1316
01:50:34,953 --> 01:50:37,115
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also a very slow rotary.

1317
01:50:37,935 --> 01:50:43,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say it is easier to take the lane in Powder House than it used to because the lane is narrower now.

1318
01:50:43,839 --> 01:50:44,059
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1319
01:50:45,080 --> 01:50:45,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1320
01:50:46,520 --> 01:51:15,706
[SPEAKER_05]: The only saving grace for this is that there are fewer cars going west on 60 who turn right to then go up on Mystic Valley Parkway than there are cars coming from Arlington who go around the rotary and therefore have the right of way who turn left and go up Mystic Valley Parkway.

1321
01:51:16,412 --> 01:51:22,995
[SPEAKER_05]: That's small consolation, but at least the numbers make it not as bad as it could be.

1322
01:51:23,015 --> 01:51:26,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's on the Medford side, less so on the Arlington side.

1323
01:51:27,578 --> 01:51:27,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1324
01:51:33,401 --> 01:51:38,203
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a lot of people go up Sagamore or other ways to get to the lakes, as an example.

1325
01:51:38,503 --> 01:51:41,945
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't necessarily go all the way to the Rotary, but take a hard right.

1326
01:51:42,786 --> 01:51:43,406
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's

1327
01:51:45,183 --> 01:51:49,705
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a small consolation, but it seems to be what the count looks like.

1328
01:51:53,427 --> 01:51:54,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, go ahead, Chris.

1329
01:51:54,848 --> 01:52:02,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, I'll note in Malmo, this is how they do road race in Sweden.

1330
01:52:02,652 --> 01:52:03,352
[SPEAKER_08]: It works.

1331
01:52:10,344 --> 01:52:14,086
[SPEAKER_08]: But of course, that's with separated bike infrastructure too.

1332
01:52:14,407 --> 01:52:25,794
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also that the motorists are more familiar with the patterns and therefore have an expectation of cyclists being to the right in those situations.

1333
01:52:26,514 --> 01:52:32,137
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that's part of the problem that we have here is to the right is out of sight, out of mind.

1334
01:52:33,058 --> 01:52:39,222
[SPEAKER_06]: And therefore, it's really important to be able to assert oneself in those situations.

1335
01:52:41,239 --> 01:52:46,982
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I wish we had what we had in Sweden or wherever, because they do it right somehow.

1336
01:52:48,383 --> 01:52:49,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Not all the time.

1337
01:52:49,604 --> 01:52:56,368
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but I mean, it never has felt like I'm being slowed down deliberately because I've approached an intersection.

1338
01:52:57,849 --> 01:53:04,113
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I've got the same throughput that motor vehicle traffic has whenever I'm in those situations.

1339
01:53:06,514 --> 01:53:08,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, go ahead, Leah.

1340
01:53:11,047 --> 01:53:11,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a couple things.

1341
01:53:12,248 --> 01:53:16,733
[SPEAKER_04]: One is I'll be the voice of dissent and say that I like Pedderhouse.

1342
01:53:18,234 --> 01:53:19,075
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm slow.

1343
01:53:19,596 --> 01:53:27,023
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a slow cyclist, so I don't mind riding through it slowly, but I feel like it strikes a nice balance of like,

1344
01:53:27,704 --> 01:53:38,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm close enough to vehicles that they can clearly see me and I haven't been shunted off completely to the side, but there's still some separation in there, which I like.

1345
01:53:38,872 --> 01:53:52,902
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing that I assume is similar to Powderhouse and I think will work well is that I assume that by clarifying where the lanes are,

1346
01:53:54,395 --> 01:54:05,383
[SPEAKER_04]: They've hopefully helped with the approach angle and the sort of illegal passing situations.

1347
01:54:06,144 --> 01:54:14,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully this improvement can cut down on some dangerous driving or aggressive driving that can happen in the rotary.

1348
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:21,054
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think whenever we make our comments or statement or wherever we're going to get to, we should kind of

1349
01:54:23,213 --> 01:54:25,075
[SPEAKER_04]: make it, you know, balanced.

1350
01:54:25,136 --> 01:54:35,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I think, you know, there's very valid points about not putting cyclists off to the side and sort of not considering all the movements that we, that someone may possibly want to do.

1351
01:54:35,569 --> 01:54:37,731
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think we also want to make sure that, like,

1352
01:54:38,999 --> 01:54:47,663
[SPEAKER_04]: No one says, oh, take the project out completely, put it back to the way it was, because there's definitely some traffic calming elements here that I think will help.

1353
01:54:49,124 --> 01:54:58,488
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll add to that and say that maybe we want to think about what we want to accomplish or what we wanted to do from here.

1354
01:54:58,508 --> 01:55:03,571
[SPEAKER_04]: It almost seems like your comments have been submitted for the long term.

1355
01:55:04,531 --> 01:55:09,753
[SPEAKER_04]: There probably isn't much we can do about this short term, but maybe there is.

1356
01:55:09,773 --> 01:55:26,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and maybe if there is, it would seem like we need some senators or something like that to kind of get involved on our behalf, because DCR is really tough to get a hold of.

1357
01:55:26,139 --> 01:55:32,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Emily.

1358
01:55:33,892 --> 01:55:46,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was just gonna say, if nothing else, it should be not too steep of an ask to just ask them to put Sharrows

1359
01:55:47,487 --> 01:56:03,619
[SPEAKER_03]: in the middle of the travel lane along with the bike lanes and put enough of them so that it's really clear that there might be bicycle traffic in that travel lane going straight through using the rotary because they're going straight.

1360
01:56:05,020 --> 01:56:08,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And that isn't a major design change.

1361
01:56:08,943 --> 01:56:13,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that can be done with a relatively minimal level of complexity.

1362
01:56:14,508 --> 01:56:26,645
[SPEAKER_03]: So if nothing else, if we end up with, if we end up with this, I think we can mitigate at least some of the problems by asking for sharrows in addition.

1363
01:56:26,665 --> 01:56:29,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other, the other

1364
01:56:30,725 --> 01:56:37,327
[SPEAKER_03]: potential problem with some of these places that we didn't mention is a similar situation to the left hook.

1365
01:56:38,027 --> 01:56:50,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know that this is a potential right hook issue, and it maybe isn't not that many people are turning right there, but that people are essentially coming from the other direction and making a left using the rotary.

1366
01:56:50,931 --> 01:56:54,632
[SPEAKER_03]: But what can happen if you have all the cyclists going straight

1367
01:56:55,820 --> 01:56:56,803
[SPEAKER_03]: on the right like that?

1368
01:56:57,385 --> 01:57:01,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it somebody exiting the rotary onto that road?

1369
01:57:05,106 --> 01:57:09,167
[SPEAKER_03]: sees there's opportunity behind a car that has just passed.

1370
01:57:09,987 --> 01:57:17,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And behind that car that has just passed was a person on a bike who was hidden behind a car that was on their left.

1371
01:57:18,130 --> 01:57:33,234
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the same as the, pretty similar to that left hook situation where somebody turning left hits a bicyclist because they saw a gap in traffic and they took it, but that was obscuring somebody biking on the right-hand side of that.

1372
01:57:33,774 --> 01:57:46,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we need another reason why this is concerning, I think that's the sometimes less considered counterpart to the right hook.

1373
01:57:47,381 --> 01:57:49,643
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's also a factor here.

1374
01:57:49,723 --> 01:57:52,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, if a cyclist is turning right, it doesn't matter.

1375
01:57:52,524 --> 01:57:55,105
[SPEAKER_03]: They'll be over on the right side and they'll be in the bike lane.

1376
01:57:56,206 --> 01:58:01,109
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is an issue of a cyclist who's going straight.

1377
01:58:03,799 --> 01:58:15,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if we can't fix the whole thing, adding shares to the travel lane and making it really clear that bicyclists can choose to be in either place is at least a way to mitigate it.

1378
01:58:21,845 --> 01:58:22,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Bruce.

1379
01:58:22,863 --> 01:58:29,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so just a couple of comments regarding the points that Leah had made at Outer House.

1380
01:58:30,047 --> 01:58:47,076
[SPEAKER_06]: I can understand how the current way it's set up is more comfortable for somebody who's willing to basically walk their way slowly through the intersection and watch every time they're crossing one of the ways that somebody is not taking their right of way.

1381
01:58:48,676 --> 01:58:49,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I can understand that.

1382
01:58:49,676 --> 01:59:00,579
[SPEAKER_06]: But the second thing is the rotary on the Arlington side, at least, is a much faster rotary than the one at Powderhouse Square.

1383
01:59:01,700 --> 01:59:05,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Both College Avenue and Broadway are slower streets.

1384
01:59:06,841 --> 01:59:14,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Powderhouse previously didn't used to be, but they put in mountains all over the place, making it harder to go fast on Powderhouse.

1385
01:59:14,545 --> 01:59:24,970
[SPEAKER_06]: In any event, that rotary is inherently a much slower rotary than the one on the Arlington side there is.

1386
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:28,212
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is one of the reasons why

1387
01:59:29,292 --> 01:59:50,093
[SPEAKER_06]: pushing the people to the outside of the rotary like that can result in the issues that Emily was bringing up, where people get hidden by other cars, people exiting the rotary at higher speed than they ought to, but nonetheless at speeds that are apparently normal, that can create a real problem for somebody trying to cross that crosswalk.

1388
01:59:50,773 --> 01:59:51,614
[SPEAKER_06]: As a pedestrian,

1389
01:59:53,016 --> 02:00:03,849
[SPEAKER_06]: I cross that crosswalk from time to time and find it's very tricky to make sure that people coming off the rotary, particularly those making the left turn through the rotary,

1390
02:00:05,638 --> 02:00:05,958
[SPEAKER_06]: see you.

1391
02:00:06,699 --> 02:00:17,748
[SPEAKER_06]: People making the right turn seem to see you more often because you're kind of in the way, but people in the rotary don't, and that becomes a very scary aspect as a pedestrian.

1392
02:00:17,828 --> 02:00:25,936
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'd be great if we could make those into more modern roundabouts where, you know, you're deliberately being slowed down to 15 miles an hour.

1393
02:00:27,802 --> 02:00:35,607
[SPEAKER_06]: that would make it easier for bicycle traffic to get through at a reasonable speed and remaining safe.

1394
02:00:36,827 --> 02:00:41,010
[SPEAKER_04]: But you just put in the chat that you don't want flex posts.

1395
02:00:41,110 --> 02:00:43,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And how would we make the speeds?

1396
02:00:44,352 --> 02:00:49,615
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to call out, A, we are about five minutes over time.

1397
02:00:49,695 --> 02:00:52,797
[SPEAKER_08]: So I request that everyone make their comments.

1398
02:00:53,617 --> 02:01:05,810
[SPEAKER_08]: relatively brief if they can, and at the end of this, I would like to propose that we move the budget proposals and the other follow-up items to another meeting.

1399
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:08,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, didn't mean to cut you off there, Leah.

1400
02:01:08,913 --> 02:01:10,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to get those out there.

1401
02:01:10,634 --> 02:01:10,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

1402
02:01:14,535 --> 02:01:23,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just wanted some clarification on people's opposition to the flex posts if we get in the way.

1403
02:01:23,767 --> 02:01:23,987
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

1404
02:01:25,427 --> 02:01:26,327
[SPEAKER_06]: that get in the way.

1405
02:01:26,347 --> 02:01:28,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Of what?

1406
02:01:28,688 --> 02:01:40,612
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're trying to make a turn, for example, or trying to merge with traffic as you approach a conflict point, the flex boats are generally spaced in a manner that they are in the way of bicycle operation.

1407
02:01:41,612 --> 02:01:45,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I can cite several examples around the metropolitan area if you want to go look.

1408
02:01:45,733 --> 02:01:46,633
[SPEAKER_06]: and experiencing it.

1409
02:01:47,573 --> 02:01:53,235
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are places where flex posts across the bridge on a straightaway, no big deal.

1410
02:01:54,575 --> 02:01:55,635
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not a problem.

1411
02:01:56,295 --> 02:01:59,496
[SPEAKER_06]: Except when you're trying to pass another slow cyclist, but that's a different problem.

1412
02:01:59,976 --> 02:02:09,098
[SPEAKER_06]: But when the flex posts continue too deeply into the intersection, they don't allow for effective lane control if that's what's necessary to be safe at that intersection.

1413
02:02:10,558 --> 02:02:12,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why it's a problem.

1414
02:02:12,138 --> 02:02:14,339
[SPEAKER_06]: You might disagree with me, but it is a problem.

1415
02:02:16,035 --> 02:02:18,376
[SPEAKER_06]: What I would ask for is that flexible.

1416
02:02:19,796 --> 02:02:20,357
[SPEAKER_06]: That's debatable.

1417
02:02:20,577 --> 02:02:21,797
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 20-foot lane.

1418
02:02:21,817 --> 02:02:24,918
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see if it's not narrower.

1419
02:02:24,978 --> 02:02:28,920
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we ask for anyone to drive less aggressively or slower?

1420
02:02:28,940 --> 02:02:33,461
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what you mean.

1421
02:02:34,141 --> 02:02:37,542
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyhow, that's an argument we don't need to have at this point.

1422
02:02:37,943 --> 02:02:39,203
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1423
02:02:39,743 --> 02:02:41,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I saw Ernie and then Chris.

1424
02:02:41,944 --> 02:02:44,345
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just a tiny tailing off of what

1425
02:02:45,682 --> 02:02:49,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Bruce was saying there before we got on to the FlexPost issue.

1426
02:02:50,665 --> 02:03:06,335
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way it is now, and this is what I'm afraid of, bicyclists going west on 60, coming to the rotary, are encouraged by the bike lane of sorts to turn right.

1427
02:03:07,558 --> 02:03:19,539
[SPEAKER_05]: Perhaps thinking they have that right of way and not yielding to a car coming from Arlington in the rotary that has

1428
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:28,787
[SPEAKER_05]: full right of way through the rotary onto Mystic Valley Parkway before they turn right in this supposed bike lane.

1429
02:03:29,488 --> 02:03:46,742
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's the case, that's a further endangerment because a bicyclist in a bike lane is at, on a right turn, is apt to take it and maybe not yield to someone in a rotary that's ahead and on the left a bit.

1430
02:03:48,575 --> 02:03:49,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you see what I'm saying?

1431
02:03:50,116 --> 02:04:17,370
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that we don't have the throughput lane encouraging the bicyclist to perhaps go straight or turn right perhaps precludes the necessary caution a bicyclist would have even when turning right at that rotary by thinking they can turn right in their bike lane and not have to obey the rotary rules.

1432
02:04:19,625 --> 02:04:20,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you not follow me?

1433
02:04:20,586 --> 02:04:22,848
[SPEAKER_05]: You all look- No, I understand.

1434
02:04:23,088 --> 02:04:23,909
[SPEAKER_06]: I follow you, Ernie.

1435
02:04:24,449 --> 02:04:25,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's it.

1436
02:04:27,812 --> 02:04:46,848
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just an observation that the current design is even worse than I thought, because it doesn't remind bicyclists that there's rotary traffic that has right of way crossing them if they are intending to turn right, because the bike lane suggests that as the only option.

1437
02:04:49,277 --> 02:04:54,154
[SPEAKER_05]: creating a cognitive dissonance in the bicyclist's brain as to who has the right of way.

1438
02:04:55,420 --> 02:04:55,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1439
02:04:56,421 --> 02:05:02,324
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was going to just try to summarize this up in terms of what can we try to do about it.

1440
02:05:02,904 --> 02:05:05,586
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think there's a few suggestions.

1441
02:05:06,907 --> 02:05:14,251
[SPEAKER_09]: I like Emily's idea of sharrows in the rotaries makes it clear to cars that cyclists can go there.

1442
02:05:14,651 --> 02:05:22,816
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing I think that could be useful is the dash lines where the bike lane would be able to go straight, like what's in that page 32 of that proposal.

1443
02:05:23,376 --> 02:05:34,184
[SPEAKER_09]: which maybe is as simple as some black paint to create dashes, so that it makes it clear that cyclists can cross straight through rather than stick to a defined course.

1444
02:05:35,746 --> 02:05:41,310
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to try to go out and get some photos if that's helpful for us, and then maybe we can sketch up or mark something.

1445
02:05:41,330 --> 02:05:50,257
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the question though is, who can we even bring this to and how do we actually try to get any change to happen here?

1446
02:05:51,437 --> 02:05:54,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, yeah, we still officially have quorum.

1447
02:05:55,540 --> 02:06:04,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like to, so generally what I'm hearing is that all of us are upset with the current design of the Rotary.

1448
02:06:05,565 --> 02:06:16,731
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I would propose is that we take a motion to have me take an executive action to write a letter to DCR expressing the

1449
02:06:18,472 --> 02:06:33,666
[SPEAKER_08]: discontent with their lack of public comment and push for at least a set of sharrows to be added to all of the sections of the road that have been recently repaved to indicate that cyclists have

1450
02:06:34,566 --> 02:07:01,745
[SPEAKER_08]: uh also have a right-of-way there or maybe not right-of-way but right of use of lane um and then to also push to have a public comment period um on their current design that that is my takeaway from this i realize that i'm sort of um i'm ad-libbing or sort of riffing on this a bit but i'd like to propose that as a motion uh before the next meeting so moved

1451
02:07:02,573 --> 02:07:09,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I would like to only add that the shadows are seen as a necessary but insufficient temporary.

1452
02:07:10,817 --> 02:07:23,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, anything at this point will be considered a temporary improvement over the current iteration or design and that they need to readdress this in a more complete manner in the short term.

1453
02:07:24,105 --> 02:07:24,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

1454
02:07:25,245 --> 02:07:25,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1455
02:07:26,046 --> 02:07:26,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

1456
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:29,781
[SPEAKER_08]: So do I take that as a second, Ernie?

1457
02:07:30,101 --> 02:07:31,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that's a second.

1458
02:07:31,622 --> 02:07:33,683
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, all in favor?

1459
02:07:33,703 --> 02:07:35,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1460
02:07:35,083 --> 02:07:36,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1461
02:07:36,124 --> 02:07:37,104
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1462
02:07:37,444 --> 02:07:37,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1463
02:07:37,684 --> 02:07:38,245
[SPEAKER_08]: All opposed?

1464
02:07:39,725 --> 02:07:41,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Hearing none, the ayes have it.

1465
02:07:43,027 --> 02:07:46,568
[SPEAKER_08]: That I will put as my top priority to do in the next week.

1466
02:07:47,569 --> 02:07:53,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I will write something up and send that over to DCR to push them to try and rectify this issue.

1467
02:07:56,587 --> 02:08:02,490
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, I'm sorry to rush everyone through that, but I know that we have a couple items, but okay, go ahead, Ernie.

1468
02:08:03,210 --> 02:08:07,412
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to make a motion that we adjourn, unless you have other items.

1469
02:08:07,472 --> 02:08:09,813
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that was what I was going for.

1470
02:08:09,933 --> 02:08:14,635
[SPEAKER_06]: First, point of order, first a motion to table the next agenda item, then a motion to adjourn.

1471
02:08:15,195 --> 02:08:15,295
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

1472
02:08:16,176 --> 02:08:18,937
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion to table the next agenda item on reviewing our goals.

1473
02:08:19,617 --> 02:08:20,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

1474
02:08:20,577 --> 02:08:21,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Second, okay.

1475
02:08:21,398 --> 02:08:22,278
[SPEAKER_08]: All in favor?

1476
02:08:23,719 --> 02:08:23,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

1477
02:08:24,499 --> 02:08:25,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, all opposed?

1478
02:08:27,879 --> 02:08:29,529
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I make a motion to adjourn.

1479
02:08:30,643 --> 02:08:31,763
[SPEAKER_08]: Robert be damned.

1480
02:08:31,803 --> 02:08:32,164
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1481
02:08:32,224 --> 02:08:32,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Goodbye, Robert.

1482
02:08:33,284 --> 02:08:33,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Robert's gone.

1483
02:08:33,824 --> 02:08:34,805
[SPEAKER_08]: We kicked him out.

1484
02:08:34,845 --> 02:08:36,745
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good night, everyone.

1485
02:08:36,945 --> 02:08:39,246
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll write that letter ASAP.

1486
02:08:39,326 --> 02:08:40,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye, everybody.

1487
02:08:40,307 --> 02:08:40,827
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1488
02:08:41,207 --> 02:08:41,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.
