1
00:00:00,071 --> 00:00:02,212
All right, it looks like we can get started.

2
00:00:02,952 --> 00:00:03,112
It's 101.

3
00:00:03,412 --> 00:00:13,736
This is the public meeting, City of Medford Liquor License Commission for July 17th.

4
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,077
It'll come to order.

5
00:00:17,397 --> 00:00:27,721
We do have an agenda to follow, and the first thing on the agenda is to approve the minutes from May's meeting and June's meeting

6
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,164
And thank you, Daria, for sending them over today.

7
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:39,372
And does anyone have any comments, suggestions, modifications on those minutes?

8
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:44,451
Mr. Chairman, Dario, you did a fantastic job as always.

9
00:00:44,491 --> 00:00:49,135
You've really captured the essence of that May 15th meeting.

10
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:52,278
I read through it.

11
00:00:52,598 --> 00:00:54,180
I'm fine with it.

12
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:01,686
I don't know if my other two commissioners are fine with it, but I guess I'd like to make a motion.

13
00:01:01,826 --> 00:01:03,648
But first, I want to just hear from Ben.

14
00:01:04,789 --> 00:01:05,490
Ben, what do you think?

15
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,654
Yeah, they were pretty packed meetings.

16
00:01:08,754 --> 00:01:14,016
I've read through them, and the minutes look very thorough, very complete.

17
00:01:14,256 --> 00:01:19,838
So I'm good with that motion if you want to make it.

18
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:20,978
Sure.

19
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:31,082
Mr. Chairman, I'll make a motion to approve the minutes from the May 15 Licensing Commission meeting as is.

20
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:31,262
OK.

21
00:01:36,998 --> 00:01:37,818
Then you want a second.

22
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:38,499
Yep.

23
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:38,919
And I'll second that.

24
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:39,099
Alrighty.

25
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:39,519
All those in favor.

26
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:40,600
Aye.

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:40,680

00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:41,000
Aye.

32
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,320
Aye.

Aye.

71
00:01:47,284 --> 00:01:47,384
Aye.

72
00:01:47,404 --> 00:01:47,464
Aye.

73
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:47,544
Aye.

74
00:01:47,564 --> 00:01:48,244
Aye.

75
00:01:48,264 --> 00:01:48,324
Aye.

76
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:48,404

Aye.

84
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:49,105
Aye.

85
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:49,205
Aye.

86
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:49,285
Aye.

87
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:51,086

Aye.

98
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:52,046
Aye.

99
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:52,126
Aye.

100
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:52,206
Aye.

101
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:52,286
Aye.

102
00:01:52,306 --> 00:01:52,366
Aye.

103
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:52,446
Aye.

104
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:52,526
Aye.

105
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:52,606
Aye.

106
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:52,686
Aye.

107
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:55,428
Aye.

108
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:55,528
Aye.

109
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:55,628
Aye.

110
00:01:55,648 --> 00:01:55,708
Aye.

111
00:01:55,728 --> 00:01:55,808
Aye.

112
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:55,888
Aye.

113
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:56,008
Aye.

114
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:56,108
Aye.

115
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:56,208
Aye.

116
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:56,288
Aye.

117
00:01:56,308 --> 00:01:56,368
Aye.

118
00:01:56,388 --> 00:01:56,449
Aye.

119
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:56,529
Aye.

120
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:56,609
Aye.

121
00:01:56,629 --> 00:01:56,689
Aye.

122
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:56,809
Aye.

123
00:01:56,829 --> 00:01:56,909
Aye.

124
00:01:56,949 --> 00:01:57,029
Aye.

125
00:01:57,049 --> 00:01:57,109
Aye.

126
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:57,189
Aye.

127
00:01:57,209 --> 00:01:57,269
Aye

128
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:03,396
I'm going to go a little out of batting order here.

129
00:02:05,018 --> 00:02:11,544
Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, are we going to do the, was that the voting of all the minutes or was that just the main minutes?

130
00:02:13,045 --> 00:02:15,108
Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

131
00:02:15,148 --> 00:02:17,150
We should have probably done them individually, correct?

132
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,671
Yeah, two different events.

133
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:21,732
Okay, so that was the May minutes.

134
00:02:22,352 --> 00:02:23,333
May 15th, yeah.

135
00:02:24,013 --> 00:02:25,273
That's why I delayed a little bit.

136
00:02:25,793 --> 00:02:28,333
So the other one is the June 26th meeting.

137
00:02:28,934 --> 00:02:29,154
Yeah.

138
00:02:29,174 --> 00:02:29,354
Right.

139
00:02:30,454 --> 00:02:32,794
So I read through those.

140
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:36,375
I thought that it seemed quite thorough myself.

141
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:38,915
So I'm good with them.

142
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:39,795
Okay.

143
00:02:40,075 --> 00:02:45,836
Yeah, no, I agree that Daria does a good job of capturing the nuances.

144
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:48,197
Mr. Chairman, number 11.

145
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:52,442
on the minutes.

146
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:54,123
Take a look at number 11.

147
00:02:54,583 --> 00:03:02,787
Does that have to be modified or tweaked or whatever the kids say nowadays?

148
00:03:02,867 --> 00:03:04,408
But I'm just looking at 11.

149
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:15,194
If we're going to address some of the control compliance violations, number 11 kind of says that we're kicking the can down to September.

150
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:18,564
Yeah, I see that.

151
00:03:18,644 --> 00:03:21,186
Yeah, that's a good catch, Alan.

152
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:24,388
I think, Daria, will it change that?

153
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:32,614
I can amend it, but we originally, during the meeting, discussed that the next time we'll discuss this was September, so I wanted to

154
00:03:33,535 --> 00:03:35,136
Yeah, exactly what was said in the meeting.

155
00:03:35,156 --> 00:03:36,237
That's why.

156
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:41,502
And I get you because September would be the next official meeting, right?

157
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:46,827
Because normally the commission, we hunker down for the summer.

158
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:52,792
We're off in July and August, and then we go back to our normal business in September.

159
00:03:52,812 --> 00:03:53,893
So I get that.

160
00:03:54,013 --> 00:03:55,834
So I don't know.

161
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:01,642
If we tweak it, however you want to do it, Mr. Chairman, I'm fine with it.

162
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:02,883
But everything else, I'm good.

163
00:04:02,903 --> 00:04:15,493
I'd like to make a motion, as I said, to approve the minutes for the June 26 meeting on the condition that we kind of tweak number 11.

164
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:19,696
That sounds good.

165
00:04:20,556 --> 00:04:21,297
Yeah, I'm good with that.

166
00:04:22,057 --> 00:04:24,419
So I'll second that motion as well.

167
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:25,320
OK.

168
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:27,168
All those in favor?

169
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:28,809
Aye.

170
00:04:28,989 --> 00:04:29,109
Aye.

171
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,771
All those opposed?

172
00:04:32,892 --> 00:04:34,733
Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

173
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:36,074
It's been approved.

174
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:38,315
Okay.

175
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:42,038
Okay, that takes care of

176
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,402
her notes and minutes of the past meetings.

177
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:57,728
What I want to do is switch it around a little is I want to see if we can get Snappy Patties out of the way, because that should be pretty quick.

178
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:01,851
Is there a representative from Snappy Patties here?

179
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,632
I am online.

180
00:05:03,652 --> 00:05:04,232
Yes, indeed.

181
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:08,135
OK, could you state your name and business for the record, sir?

182
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:09,175
Certainly.

183
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:11,417
Adam Gazzola, owner of Snappy Patties.

184
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:13,158
All right, Adam.

185
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:15,752
Okay.

186
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,250
All right, Adam, we received all the paperwork.

187
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:27,813
I know you've been concerned about having your hours extended.

188
00:05:29,013 --> 00:05:42,381
The city of Medford has their own ordinance for this, which is in, it's a little more stringent than the ABCC's hours, but you followed all the guidelines.

189
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:49,065
You went before the city clerk and the city council and they approved

190
00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:56,691
your hours, and we have all the paperwork in front of us.

191
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:58,792
It looks like all the forms are in order.

192
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:07,935
We've got the monetary transmittal form, and we've got the corporate vote form, which is also completed.

193
00:06:08,015 --> 00:06:08,835
Thank you very much.

194
00:06:09,055 --> 00:06:16,558
We've got a copy of the Newcomen Vigilance License.

195
00:06:16,698 --> 00:06:17,878
Just keep in mind

196
00:06:19,342 --> 00:06:23,266
the new hours they put on it, from 7 a.m.

197
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:26,490
to 1 a.m., that's for food only?

198
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:32,717
Yeah, I don't think I could dare serve food that long, but yeah, no, I understand.

199
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:39,961
Yeah, well, basically what I'm trying to get to is it doesn't include liquor for the 7 a.m.

200
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,823
Oh, no, no, absolutely not.

201
00:06:42,504 --> 00:06:43,225
Absolutely not.

202
00:06:43,805 --> 00:06:44,026
Right.

203
00:06:44,206 --> 00:06:47,209
And the days that you're going to stay open till 1 a.m.

204
00:06:47,329 --> 00:06:48,991
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

205
00:06:49,552 --> 00:06:55,836
your kitchen is required to be open because any time liquor is being served in the city of Medford.

206
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:56,857
Absolutely.

207
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:59,418
You have to have food available.

208
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:00,579
Absolutely.

209
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:11,906
The the just to keep you informed, the late night is generally by request because Medford and West Meredith is generally not a festive late night crowd.

210
00:07:12,347 --> 00:07:14,588
We have we have more people eating ice cream at 10 a.m.

211
00:07:14,608 --> 00:07:15,529
than we do drinking beer.

212
00:07:15,549 --> 00:07:17,150
So I'm fine with that.

213
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,651
Yeah, I'm more than fine with that.

214
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:26,026
And you don't have to be open that late every Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

215
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:29,971
I mean, it's just if you've got a special event or you want to stay open to the place, it's crowded.

216
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:30,432
That's cool.

217
00:07:30,612 --> 00:07:31,293
You know, yeah.

218
00:07:31,393 --> 00:07:35,899
The irony of all of this, usually when we're asked to stay open and we've been open for 10 years,

219
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,101
And we've made requests.

220
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:42,384
It in the past, it's been a lot of folks from City Hall.

221
00:07:42,424 --> 00:07:46,206
We've had a lot of retirement parties, a lot of municipality folk.

222
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,748
You know, I say City Hall, so the police or fire that have come in.

223
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:55,672
So it's it's it's orderly and it's it's a very different crowd, which we look to serve.

224
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:57,794
We're not we're not looking for the tough party crowd.

225
00:07:58,374 --> 00:07:59,495
So that's it.

226
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,950
Well, that's great.

227
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:05,313
Okay, I mean, everything, it looks in order to me, Alan, Ben.

228
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:11,858
Yeah, no, I just wanted to reiterate, Adam, you're a very smart businessman, you're very wise.

229
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:21,204
Just keep in mind, as a good rule of thumb, all alcohol, you have to serve food, and that's, I just wanted to reiterate that.

230
00:08:21,265 --> 00:08:23,466
Oh, absolutely, we have a special late night menu.

231
00:08:24,867 --> 00:08:26,908
Generally, you know, we're a family,

232
00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:49,760
uh run restaurant we we i would rather have a brunch and a dinner service than a late night bar crowd any day of the week because medford isn't styled for that um we do have late night fair uh and the people that we seek to serve at this hour are people who either do a special request and you know at around 10 o'clock we're generally looking to close down

233
00:08:50,300 --> 00:09:00,389
both the kitchen and the bar, unless we have special request or a crowd and a town is deeming that, hey, there's a lot of business here, we're still gonna stay open.

234
00:09:00,429 --> 00:09:09,656
But by and large, we are stressed as a small company, both with labor and employees, the number of hours we can possibly work.

235
00:09:10,177 --> 00:09:18,324
So we'd rather concentrate on the smarter business, which is families and the community, rather than trying to outreach to fast business.

236
00:09:19,896 --> 00:09:21,237
Very good, very good.

237
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,738
Yeah, I was okay with everything as well.

238
00:09:25,238 --> 00:09:33,102
You guys, I saw what Adam has presented and with the city's okay with it as he's gone through this, I'm okay on the liquor end.

239
00:09:33,502 --> 00:09:36,183
Okay, sounds great.

240
00:09:37,624 --> 00:09:37,924
Thank you.

241
00:09:38,004 --> 00:09:39,905
If one of you gentlemen would like to make a motion.

242
00:09:41,605 --> 00:09:43,126
Ben, you want to make a motion?

243
00:09:43,246 --> 00:09:44,547
Yeah, I can.

244
00:09:44,687 --> 00:09:46,388
I'll make sure I'm saying this correctly.

245
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,839
I'm looking at the different documents, so I'll make a motion.

246
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,341
To approve.

247
00:09:53,361 --> 00:10:00,067
The extension of hours extension.

248
00:10:00,127 --> 00:10:05,952
OK, so the extension of the hours shown on this common vigorous license from.

249
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:09,915
Thursday, Friday, Saturday from 7 AM to 1 PM, that's.

250
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:16,260
As for the food, so for the for the liquor portion of of that.

251
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,232
Um, as as we've said, the bar has to stay open.

252
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:23,754
Sorry, the kitchen has to stay open when the bar does.

253
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:31,358
So, I don't know if that is that well said.

254
00:10:31,378 --> 00:10:33,019
Thank you, Ben.

255
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:34,460
I 2nd, that motion.

256
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,202
Yeah, all those in favor say, hi.

257
00:10:41,513 --> 00:10:44,675
Aaron, and seeing none, your application has been approved.

258
00:10:45,015 --> 00:10:48,297
Congratulations, and good luck with your extended hours.

259
00:10:48,738 --> 00:10:49,178
Thank you.

260
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:49,778
Good luck.

261
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:50,839
Good luck, Adam.

262
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:51,680
Thank you.

263
00:10:55,082 --> 00:11:04,468
OK, next on the agenda, we have a matter from last month, T1 soccer.

264
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:05,989
We table that.

265
00:11:08,726 --> 00:11:11,449
that requests for two one-day licenses.

266
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:16,773
And do we have a representative from D1 Stocker?

267
00:11:20,757 --> 00:11:21,638
Mr. Georges?

268
00:11:21,658 --> 00:11:24,901
I wonder.

269
00:11:24,921 --> 00:11:32,188
I don't see him on, but I did send him the Zoom link.

270
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:33,429
Let's see.

271
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:39,481
I told them to attend today.

272
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:42,443
It's only that's unusual because thank you.

273
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,564
Aren't they?

274
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:45,424
Aren't they a go?

275
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:49,007
They need to, they need an answer to say they're ready to go, right?

276
00:11:49,027 --> 00:11:50,888
Yeah.

277
00:11:50,908 --> 00:11:55,151
I mean, their licenses haven't been approved.

278
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:56,912
You're supposed to be here today.

279
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:57,973
Right.

280
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,955
And we made them aware of how critical this meeting is.

281
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,306
Maybe we can remind them and then see if they hop on by the end of the meeting.

282
00:12:12,346 --> 00:12:15,247
And if not, yeah, just email them again.

283
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:15,867
Yeah.

284
00:12:16,107 --> 00:12:16,327
Yeah.

285
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:17,348
Yeah.

286
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:17,828
Okay.

287
00:12:18,068 --> 00:12:18,668
We'll do that.

288
00:12:18,888 --> 00:12:25,530
And then we'll, instead we'll just move forward with the, the violation portion of the meeting.

289
00:12:28,931 --> 00:12:29,211
Okay.

290
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:30,831
Yeah.

291
00:12:31,212 --> 00:12:32,992
You have to jump off halfway through.

292
00:12:33,312 --> 00:12:33,552
Yeah.

293
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:35,833
That'll work.

294
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:44,238
Okay, well, next on the agenda will be the alcohol compliance check violations.

295
00:12:45,599 --> 00:12:52,545
Um, as as Alan had mentioned, my fellow commissioner that we normally don't have meetings in July or August.

296
00:12:52,925 --> 00:13:01,112
Um, but we felt as though, um, the people involved felt as though that this was important enough to do as soon as possible.

297
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:02,413
Um,

298
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:16,654
What we're going to do is we have six violations total, and we're going to, in a moment, I'm gonna turn it over, the meeting over to Lieutenant Larkowitz.

299
00:13:17,235 --> 00:13:22,939
And what he's gonna do is he's gonna read the compliance violations for each licensee.

300
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,085
And all the licensee violations were for selling alcohol to a person under 21 years old.

301
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:42,916
After Lieutenant Lockowicz reads the licensee's violation reports, the licensee will then have the opportunity to speak before the commission.

302
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:52,887
The people we have in attendance for this is our Secretary, Terri Tahara.

303
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:57,905
Um, myself, uh, the commission chair, Robert Delifano.

304
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:06,430
Uh, we have Commissioner Alan Maturana and Commissioner Ben O'Sullivan Pierce representing the method police department.

305
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:17,957
We have Lieutenant Lockowitz, Officer Smith and Officer Sebastian, uh, representing the city of Medford Health Department, Catherine Ding rep and Sophie Greenbaum.

306
00:14:19,524 --> 00:14:36,513
and the six licensees that should be present on this meeting is the Hillside Wine and Spirits, Medford Wine and Spirits, Blue Fuji Restaurant, Deep Cuts Restaurant, Aya Place, and Real Gusto Restaurant.

307
00:14:38,615 --> 00:14:42,737
Before Lieutenant Lockowicz's presentation,

308
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,521
before I turn it over to him.

309
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:58,514
I just wanted to let you folks know, and this is only my opinion, and it's basically the opinion of the commission, is the city of Method takes this very seriously.

310
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:08,924
If these violations were not a compliance check, it could have been a very different outcome.

311
00:15:10,675 --> 00:15:20,422
And if alcohol was purchased and consumed by a minor, there could have been injuries, even death caused by that minor.

312
00:15:22,063 --> 00:15:30,810
And it could have been caused to the minor as well as an innocent bystander or a family member.

313
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:36,386
our complete family, yours and mine.

314
00:15:36,787 --> 00:15:39,949
And unfortunately, there's no second chances at that point.

315
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,211
So that's how serious this is.

316
00:15:43,271 --> 00:15:57,542
And what I'd like to do is see if my fellow commissioners have any comments, further comments on that before we turn this over to Lieutenant Lockwood.

317
00:16:00,535 --> 00:16:03,738
Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.

318
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:09,444
You know, I served on this commission.

319
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:18,152
City moved forward with business being a support.

320
00:16:18,252 --> 00:16:25,299
Honestly, in my 12 years on this commission, we have never had six failed control costs.

321
00:16:27,869 --> 00:16:31,110
Checks, that's disgraceful, absolutely disgraceful.

322
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:39,392
I don't know if... Alan, if you turn your camera off, your sound is breaking up a little bit.

323
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:41,932
This is a sign of the time.

324
00:16:41,952 --> 00:16:45,333
Well, I think it's just the... Wi-Fi.

325
00:16:45,393 --> 00:16:45,933
I think I lost...

326
00:16:57,096 --> 00:16:57,756
Am I still there?

327
00:16:57,776 --> 00:17:00,719
Yeah, we can see it.

328
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:03,401
Sometimes if you click your camera off, it'll make it better.

329
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:11,007
You mean click your camera off?

330
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:14,450
Turn your stop, hit stop video.

331
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:16,312
The audio just comes in better.

332
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,720
OK, I'll try that.

333
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:23,221
All right.

334
00:17:24,481 --> 00:17:25,462
I've shut the video down.

335
00:17:25,482 --> 00:17:33,724
I guess what I'm driving at is I'm really shocked at the fact that there's been six violations in all my 12 years.

336
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:36,045
We had maybe one, two, three at the most.

337
00:17:36,145 --> 00:17:42,867
And we all prided ourselves on the fact that everybody was doing the right thing.

338
00:17:43,587 --> 00:17:44,788
Everyone was aware of

339
00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:52,974
of serving to a minor, what could result from serving to a minor.

340
00:17:53,074 --> 00:18:09,146
So I'm very anxious to hear the situation, the circumstances, what the merchants have to say about what they've done and what steps they're going to take to prevent this from happening again.

341
00:18:10,167 --> 00:18:14,149
So I guess that's all I got to say.

342
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:14,670
Like I said,

343
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:21,417
Uh, not to be an echo chamber here, but six is the most I've ever seen in 12 years.

344
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:27,263
And would you get a comment?

345
00:18:28,965 --> 00:18:30,727
Yeah, no, that's I agree with you both.

346
00:18:32,449 --> 00:18:37,054
So here from Mr. Lieutenant Walkowitz.

347
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:45,940
Okay, yeah, Lieutenant Lakowicz, if that's the protocol, I'm a little new in this chair.

348
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:53,642
If that's the protocol, I'm sure- Happy to try to help get the ball rolling here.

349
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:55,722
Good afternoon, everybody.

350
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,922
I'm Lieutenant Rory Lakowicz.

351
00:18:56,942 --> 00:19:02,864
I've been the compliance officer for the city for 12, 13 years, maybe, 14 years.

352
00:19:08,045 --> 00:19:12,349
I'd like to make one little tweak, Mr. Commissioner.

353
00:19:14,171 --> 00:19:23,500
I'd like to just kind of go over what we did, and then for the individual reports, turn it over to the officers who wrote said reports, if that's okay with you.

354
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:25,802
Yes, absolutely.

355
00:19:27,343 --> 00:19:27,604
So,

356
00:19:29,633 --> 00:19:34,900
We conducted a round of compliance checks throughout the entire city, broken up into two dates.

357
00:19:35,901 --> 00:19:37,122
One was June the 20th.

358
00:19:37,883 --> 00:19:39,305
One was June the 26th.

359
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:42,969
I was working as the shift commander back at the station.

360
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:47,275
It was officers Smith and Sebastian who are in the other video there.

361
00:19:49,503 --> 00:20:02,127
were in an unmarked police vehicle with a member of the Board of Health, either Catherine Dhingra or Sophie Greenbaum, and de-identified juveniles.

362
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:10,030
I believe the total was five people that we utilized, but they were all under the age of 18 years old.

363
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:16,112
So our process is to

364
00:20:19,903 --> 00:20:25,367
get parent permission forms signed, bring the juveniles to the police station.

365
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:35,235
They're given breathalyzers before and after the process to ensure that there is no alcohol being consumed by them.

366
00:20:36,757 --> 00:20:40,660
It might be best for me to just read the first paragraph of one of these reports.

367
00:20:42,781 --> 00:20:45,524
This first paragraph appears in each report the same.

368
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,281
Once we're comfortable, if anybody has any questions, of course, then I'll turn it over to officers Smith and Sebastian.

369
00:20:54,942 --> 00:21:00,263
So the June 20th reports start off with between 6 p.m.

370
00:21:00,283 --> 00:21:01,763
and 9 p.m.

371
00:21:01,983 --> 00:21:02,884
1800 and 2100 hours.

372
00:21:04,984 --> 00:21:17,227
Officer Sebastian, Smith, myself, we're acting in the capacity of the alcohol compliance officer for the city of Medford for the purposes of conducting compliance checks of all licensed restaurants, liquor licensed restaurants.

373
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:32,177
Assisting and listed in the report as a witness is Sophie Greenbaum, the city's underage alcohol coordinator working on behalf of the Medford Health Department and a 16 year old female whose name is on file with Ms.

374
00:21:32,197 --> 00:21:34,298
Greenbaum and will be referred to JV1.

375
00:21:36,913 --> 00:21:38,114
in the report.

376
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:50,644
Prior to conducting any checks, JV1 was given an alcohol breathalyzer resulting in 0.0, signed a parent permission slip, and was advised of our instructions on how to conduct a liquor compliance check.

377
00:21:51,425 --> 00:21:59,071
Those instructions are JV1 was told to enter each establishment with no form of identification.

378
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:02,714
If they have their own driver's license, it's left in the vehicle with the officers.

379
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:19,731
The person is to then enter the establishment, retrieve, in this particular case, we're talking about a liquor store, retrieve a six pack or 12 pack of an alcoholic seltzer, and attempt to purchase it with the $20 bill that I had provided them and recorded the serial number.

380
00:22:21,212 --> 00:22:27,016
If the juvenile is asked for identification, they are to say that they have none, because that is the truth.

381
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,637
They do not have identification on them.

382
00:22:29,588 --> 00:22:34,911
If they're asked their age, they're instructed to answer honestly, 16, 17, et cetera.

383
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:45,716
In this case, in this report, I'm reading from the report from 45 Salem Street for Officer Sebastian.

384
00:22:47,295 --> 00:22:48,375
when I pass the baton to you.

385
00:22:50,276 --> 00:22:55,056
So if they're asked for how old they are, they're to answer honestly, which in this case is 16.

386
00:22:55,737 --> 00:23:03,518
If the juvenile served alcohol, she's to bring it back to the vehicle where Ms.

387
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:06,018
Greenbaum and Officer Sebastian were waiting.

388
00:23:07,999 --> 00:23:14,620
And that is pretty much the process for the restaurants.

389
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:27,242
The tweak to that intro paragraph is that we tried to use, and we were able to in this particular round of checks, utilize two juveniles.

390
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:35,708
I feel it's a little bit more comfortable for everybody to have two people together sitting in a restaurant.

391
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:37,938
And that's really the only tweak.

392
00:23:39,139 --> 00:23:47,960
We had two 17 year old juvenile males enter the restaurants in question and they were ordering a Bud Light.

393
00:23:51,361 --> 00:23:54,622
Anybody has any questions about the process?

394
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:56,622
I'll be happy to answer them.

395
00:23:57,962 --> 00:23:59,663
Of course, I can answer them later also.

396
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:01,243
But for the purposes of

397
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:09,455
Continuing on with these violations, I'd like to turn the first report over to Officer Sebastian.

398
00:24:11,135 --> 00:24:15,216
And the first one that I have in my hand is 45 Salem Street.

399
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:18,097
Medford Wine and Spirits.

400
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:19,277
You're unmuted.

401
00:24:20,657 --> 00:24:21,777
Good afternoon, everyone.

402
00:24:21,957 --> 00:24:28,599
I just want to ask the commission if you would want me to read this word for word or kind of just go over the

403
00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:35,494
basically the cliff notes version of what happened, or if you want me to read word for word from the report.

404
00:24:36,895 --> 00:24:46,161
Officer Sebastian, I think Lieutenant Barkowitz gave us the overall procedure of the way things were handled.

405
00:24:47,621 --> 00:24:58,528
First, you know, breathalyzing the juveniles before and after, you know, marking the bills so they could later identify the money.

406
00:24:59,577 --> 00:25:01,798
and gave them all the instructions.

407
00:25:01,858 --> 00:25:04,838
So I think you can pretty much omit all of that.

408
00:25:06,479 --> 00:25:12,660
And where we have six different violations, we kind of get the gist of it.

409
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,481
But yeah, the details of the important stuff of it would be wonderful.

410
00:25:16,521 --> 00:25:16,821
Thank you.

411
00:25:16,861 --> 00:25:18,381
All right.

412
00:25:18,881 --> 00:25:25,183
So in regards to 45 Salem Street, the juvenile entered at approximately 708.

413
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:34,197
About one minute later, the juvenile exited the store with a case of truly hard seltzer.

414
00:25:35,178 --> 00:25:42,002
I then immediately took the alcohol from the juvenile, as well as the change that was provided.

415
00:25:43,263 --> 00:25:51,769
The juvenile described the clerk as a possibly Southern Asian male wearing a blue shirt, black pants, and approximately 40 to 50 years old.

416
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:56,972
I then exited my unmarked cruiser, entered the store,

417
00:25:57,532 --> 00:26:02,783
and presented the alcohol to the employee who was the only employee working at the time.

418
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:11,914
I identified myself and informed him that I was a Medford police officer and that he had sold to a juvenile who was the age of 16.

419
00:26:12,074 --> 00:26:22,399
I gave him the change back and asked to be provided with the $20 unmarked bill as well as giving him back the merchandise.

420
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,383
The employee stated to me that he knew immediately it was a juvenile when the juvenile went to the store.

421
00:26:30,943 --> 00:26:35,424
The employee also did not seem to be upset that he just sold alcohol to a minor.

422
00:26:37,124 --> 00:26:42,105
He did provide me with his identification with the name of Rakesh Patel.

423
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:44,265
I asked if the owner was in the store.

424
00:26:44,345 --> 00:26:45,106
He stated no.

425
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:52,427
He then called the owner, who he said was Karen Patel, and I informed him what had happened.

426
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:58,628
He then just stated okay and began to speak with Rakesh in a foreign language.

427
00:27:00,148 --> 00:27:07,994
I advised them that the report would be on file and that they should be checking all parties on, for ID, for liquor sales to avoid this happening again.

428
00:27:08,014 --> 00:27:12,458
I then returned to my cruiser and let Ms.

429
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:14,119
Greenbaum know my findings.

430
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:28,771
Also, I felt that the owner and employee showed a lack of remorse and I actually felt strongly about this, so I had spoken to Lieutenant Lockowitz and

431
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:39,002
I believe that we communicated this to Officer Smith, who had two juvenile males with him.

432
00:27:39,502 --> 00:27:46,024
Later in the night, those two juvenile males attempted to go back into Medford Wine and Spirits to buy alcohol.

433
00:27:46,484 --> 00:27:50,145
The juvenile male was denied sale at this point.

434
00:27:50,905 --> 00:27:53,608
but he was told that I cannot sell to you tonight.

435
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:57,771
I was busted by the police and have to pay a $2,000 fine.

436
00:27:58,312 --> 00:28:02,155
This is what Juvenile 3 reported to Officer Smith.

437
00:28:03,096 --> 00:28:15,868
He also showed Juvenile 3 on his personal cell phone a picture of the juvenile who had entered the store earlier and was allowed to purchase the alcohol.

438
00:28:20,895 --> 00:28:24,176
Okay, thank you, officer Sebastian.

439
00:28:26,216 --> 00:28:33,858
Is Mr. Patel here?

440
00:28:34,058 --> 00:28:36,978
I actually see a few Mr. Patels.

441
00:28:37,098 --> 00:28:42,739
Is there the owner of the liquor store here?

442
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:43,840
Yes, hi.

443
00:28:46,165 --> 00:28:49,188
And I have all my manager, Kapil Patel here on with me too.

444
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:51,069
So I'll let him talk.

445
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,270
Okay.

446
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:56,334
Would you be able to just state your name and a business name for the record, please?

447
00:28:56,994 --> 00:28:57,174
Sure.

448
00:28:57,274 --> 00:28:58,355
My name is Vatsal Patel.

449
00:28:58,435 --> 00:29:00,097
I'm owner of Medford Wine and Spirit.

450
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:01,398
Okay.

451
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:08,664
Okay.

452
00:29:08,904 --> 00:29:11,466
And, um, okay.

453
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:12,407
You have,

454
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:26,250
At this point, the opportunity to tell your side of the story and what might have occurred that night and what you have to say for yourself or the employees that have been working for you.

455
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:29,872
Yes, I see Krupal Patel here.

456
00:29:30,252 --> 00:29:33,193
Could you please unmute yourself and talk to the commissioner?

457
00:29:33,213 --> 00:29:41,977
And I'll give my input at the end after he's done, because he is the more in charge of employee handling and

458
00:29:43,097 --> 00:29:44,017
So yeah, I'll let him talk.

459
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:45,158
OK.

460
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:46,198
And who is this?

461
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:48,779
Good afternoon.

462
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:49,719
Rupal Patel.

463
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:51,420
OK.

464
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,861
And your position with the company, sir?

465
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:57,042
Manager.

466
00:29:57,662 --> 00:29:58,342
You're the manager.

467
00:29:58,542 --> 00:29:59,962
OK.

468
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:00,363
OK.

469
00:30:00,623 --> 00:30:01,263
Go right ahead, sir.

470
00:30:03,043 --> 00:30:07,305
Yeah, the incident happened, and Rakesh Patel told me about the incident.

471
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:19,226
And then after, we used to ask each and everybody ID, but then after we made a proper sign and each cell without ID, we don't sell anymore now.

472
00:30:19,486 --> 00:30:20,848
Now onwards, we don't sell.

473
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:28,437
We put the sign, each and every single customer doesn't matter if they're 50 year old, 60 year old, we need ID to sell first.

474
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:37,138
Okay, so what you're saying now is your policy is that you check every single person?

475
00:30:37,218 --> 00:30:39,181
Okay.

476
00:30:41,785 --> 00:30:46,011
And being the manager, you oversee the employees in that store, correct?

477
00:30:46,772 --> 00:30:46,953
Yes.

478
00:30:48,075 --> 00:30:57,478
Okay, are you aware that the city of Medford just had a tip certification course free of charge for all on premise and off premise accounts?

479
00:30:58,578 --> 00:31:04,920
And, and not one of the six offenders here attended either one of those.

480
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,821
Now, I don't know any of your employees tip certified.

481
00:31:13,322 --> 00:31:15,883
So do you know, do you know what tip certification is?

482
00:31:18,473 --> 00:31:18,773
No.

483
00:31:19,773 --> 00:31:20,133
Okay.

484
00:31:21,094 --> 00:31:28,097
What I would advise to you is that you familiarize yourself with it.

485
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:29,718
It's T-I-P-S.

486
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:36,922
I personally took the course that was offered at the Medford Library free of charge by Ms.

487
00:31:36,962 --> 00:31:39,063
Sophie Greenbaum at the Board of Health in Medford.

488
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:43,165
And there wasn't much of a turnout there.

489
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:57,452
So I would suggest that, I would strongly advise that you have your employees attend that because it's extremely knowledgeable of procedures, what to look for in IDs.

490
00:31:57,772 --> 00:32:01,354
I couldn't believe half of the stuff that I didn't know.

491
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,456
And that goes for everybody, all six places.

492
00:32:06,528 --> 00:32:13,134
you've got to get your employees TIP certified because it's too dangerous to deal with.

493
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:24,385
Other than that, does anyone else for this license want to speak?

494
00:32:29,704 --> 00:32:41,994
I am TIP certified by the way, so I'll communicate with my manager and employee and I truly am sorry about what happened and I'll be sure that it doesn't happen moving forward.

495
00:32:43,275 --> 00:32:44,957
Okay.

496
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:52,283
Myself personally, I think that's going to be acceptable.

497
00:32:54,013 --> 00:33:11,979
What this commission, what I'll suggest to this commission to do is put a warning into your file, along with these police reports, and you're going to be on probation for one year.

498
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,682
If there is any type of violations within this year,

499
00:33:19,829 --> 00:33:24,271
then we will possibly look at suspension.

500
00:33:27,232 --> 00:33:29,533
And so it's a fair warning.

501
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:39,938
It's a fair warning like my predecessor two times ago used to say, this is your one and only bite of the apple, right Alan?

502
00:33:40,058 --> 00:33:44,640
And that's what I'm going to suggest to my fellow commissioners

503
00:33:45,519 --> 00:34:00,356
And the other thing, I'm not sure who I should address this to, whether it's Lieutenant Lakowicz or whether it's, I'm not sure, part of this,

504
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:15,382
report at the end, it said that the clerk in the store, when the two miners come in later on, stated that he was going to be fined $2,000, and he showed him a picture of the kids that come in.

505
00:34:16,403 --> 00:34:20,186
Do we think that this is something that should be done?

506
00:34:20,346 --> 00:34:22,327
Is there a law against this?

507
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,949
I mean, this is a minor.

508
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:31,374
And now this store clerk is putting it out there that, you know, this kid's in this city.

509
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,255
They probably know him.

510
00:34:33,836 --> 00:34:39,300
They're going to think this kid's a rat and start harassing him, start giving him a rough time.

511
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:44,384
Is there something that we could do to prevent this from happening in the future?

512
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:56,949
I mean, I know with all the surveillance and everything else, myself personally, I don't think it's right for the clerk or anybody to show that information to anybody and to let them know who it is.

513
00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:05,512
And I think from this point forward, if that happens, I think we should impose some type of a penalty for that.

514
00:35:06,757 --> 00:35:09,219
Mr. Commissioner, if I could jump in there.

515
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:19,227
That was a little unusual, how that bit of information that Officer Smith provided, excuse me, Officer Sebastian provided.

516
00:35:21,228 --> 00:35:27,453
When we were done with our checks, just for the record, the juveniles that we use are not from the city of Medford.

517
00:35:28,714 --> 00:35:33,638
The health departments and the agencies such as

518
00:35:37,931 --> 00:35:49,278
like Sophie Greenbaum's role often will will use juveniles in each other's cities to hopefully avoid the fact that, you know, dad says, let's grab a hamburger.

519
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:54,121
And the clerk recognizes the juvenile as somebody that had tried to purchase alcohol that week.

520
00:35:56,662 --> 00:35:57,703
But anyway.

521
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:10,050
The the juvenile in question who had been sold the alcohol stated to us after the fact that she was uncomfortable that her photo had come up.

522
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:17,252
So I took it upon myself to go down and speak with Mr. Rakesh Patel after the checks were done.

523
00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:27,707
And I explained the photo in question was was a picture taken from his security monitor screen.

524
00:36:28,548 --> 00:36:32,234
So it was just a it was just a photo of the juvenile in the store.

525
00:36:33,715 --> 00:36:36,296
And I explained she's she's underage.

526
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:41,719
You shouldn't be showing that picture to anybody but either your attorney or the owner of the store.

527
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:44,020
And that should not go anywhere else.

528
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:46,381
He said he understood.

529
00:36:46,401 --> 00:36:48,202
I believe he understood.

530
00:36:48,242 --> 00:36:49,983
Like, yes, yes.

531
00:36:50,743 --> 00:36:52,624
We had this secondary conversation.

532
00:36:52,924 --> 00:36:54,725
He cleared it up right away.

533
00:36:56,133 --> 00:37:04,580
So I'm not too worried about the barring Mr. Patel having posted her picture online, which I highly doubt.

534
00:37:05,701 --> 00:37:07,923
I think that matters probably over.

535
00:37:08,832 --> 00:37:09,893
Okay, well, that's great.

536
00:37:09,913 --> 00:37:11,474
Thank you for clearing that up for me.

537
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:15,757
Commissioners, Alan, Ben, would you care to comment?

538
00:37:16,838 --> 00:37:25,304
You know, as far as what I've said for a, you know, a punishment for this, would you have you guys feel about it?

539
00:37:25,384 --> 00:37:27,466
You think you're okay with that?

540
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:32,777
Yeah, Ben, if you don't mind, Mr. Chairman, there is precedent.

541
00:37:33,577 --> 00:37:39,158
So I think, you know, as our two predecessors, they used to say one bite of the apple.

542
00:37:39,239 --> 00:37:43,560
So I'm a big believer that, you know, sometimes things go wrong.

543
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:52,422
But as long as you understand the severity of the incident, and you've taken the correct measures, that it won't happen again.

544
00:37:52,442 --> 00:37:57,563
And by the way, the employee that served the minor,

545
00:37:59,464 --> 00:38:12,682
Is that person on probation work-wise, or was there any punishment doled out to emphasize the severity of the infraction?

546
00:38:12,702 --> 00:38:14,945
I remember in the past,

547
00:38:17,685 --> 00:38:18,845
that employee would get fired.

548
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:26,667
You know, hey, you served a minor, holy cow, you know, that person, that might not have been a controlled compliance check.

549
00:38:26,707 --> 00:38:34,828
That could have been, you know, the kids buying some beer and they're out speeding and they wrapped the car around a tree.

550
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:38,809
You know, there are ramifications, you know.

551
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:44,810
So I'm just wondering, does the employee who committed the infraction,

552
00:38:45,965 --> 00:38:52,528
fully understand the nature of the severity of what they have committed and what they've done.

553
00:38:53,028 --> 00:38:56,410
I guess that's one of my major questions and concerns.

554
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:20,510
Yes, so I'm currently having a conversation every day with Krupal, my manager, and we are making a bunch of changes internally, and one of the things we did right away is restrict the security password to just myself and my manager, so no employee is going to have security footage access moving forward, so that incident doesn't happen.

555
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:43,170
number two about checking every minor and about the scheduling shift of like busy time right like in the evening we are busy so providing additional support of additional employee so make sure they slow down and make sure they ID everyone and yeah so we're gonna incorporate training and we're gonna see what we're gonna do about Rakesh.

556
00:39:44,601 --> 00:39:45,822
Okay, that's good.

557
00:39:45,902 --> 00:39:47,363
Thank you.

558
00:39:48,424 --> 00:39:59,673
Being a youth myself, we used to know, I grew up in the city of Medford, we were no angels when we were young too, so we always knew what Paki's

559
00:40:00,577 --> 00:40:03,358
we could buy at, you know, what song and dance.

560
00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:14,520
So, you know, if the kids know that's the place to go, then, you know, you should be aware of that and make sure that doesn't, you know, that whole trend stops.

561
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,440
So I know you guys are very smart.

562
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:20,981
The whole entire family is very wise, very business savvy.

563
00:40:22,782 --> 00:40:26,242
I know you guys will take the correct steps to resolve this issue.

564
00:40:28,483 --> 00:40:29,243
Yes, and we will.

565
00:40:31,238 --> 00:40:35,739
What about Mr. Commissioner and Alan?

566
00:40:36,219 --> 00:40:39,240
What about just suggesting that they have their employees TIP certified?

567
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,520
I would agree with that.

568
00:40:43,461 --> 00:40:46,141
I mean, the manager doesn't even know what TIP certification is.

569
00:40:46,581 --> 00:40:47,922
So that would be a good start.

570
00:40:48,602 --> 00:40:48,822
Yeah.

571
00:40:48,882 --> 00:40:49,162
Yeah.

572
00:40:49,842 --> 00:40:56,523
I would think that we should possibly mandate that for at least these six violators.

573
00:40:57,824 --> 00:40:58,004
Yeah.

574
00:40:59,818 --> 00:41:01,319
Ben, I think that's a great idea.

575
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:06,504
You know, when people hear TIPS Certified, they immediately think of bartenders or bar service.

576
00:41:06,744 --> 00:41:08,606
Oh, you know, it's not a bar.

577
00:41:08,626 --> 00:41:10,647
We're not in a club.

578
00:41:10,687 --> 00:41:11,668
We're not in a restaurant.

579
00:41:11,708 --> 00:41:15,432
And I think that's where they immediately gravitate towards the thinking.

580
00:41:15,492 --> 00:41:19,135
But the TIPS Certified goes way beyond that.

581
00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:25,560
It encompasses a lot of avenues and things that you can get into trouble.

582
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,182
Would you agree, Mr. Chairman?

583
00:41:30,497 --> 00:41:31,617
Yeah, I would agree 100%.

584
00:41:31,677 --> 00:41:50,384
I think we should probably put that in form of a motion for wine and spirits that is part of the being on probation and having a note in their file for a year that their employees who are going to serve alcohol.

585
00:41:50,745 --> 00:41:51,305
Yeah.

586
00:41:51,365 --> 00:41:57,267
The customers be TIP certified in a reasonable amount of time.

587
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:01,970
That's the question, Mr. Chairman.

588
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:04,834
What is a reasonable amount of time, three months, six months?

589
00:42:04,894 --> 00:42:08,159
What would be a fair timeframe?

590
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,544
I'd say three months, but started immediately.

591
00:42:11,564 --> 00:42:13,586
So at least there's one that's TIP certified.

592
00:42:14,308 --> 00:42:17,809
You know, I mean, it's understandable.

593
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:23,772
You can't send all of your employees for a four hour course because you'd have nobody to work.

594
00:42:24,012 --> 00:42:30,855
So starting immediately, they go over the next three months to have them TIP certified.

595
00:42:31,255 --> 00:42:32,635
It's not very costly either.

596
00:42:33,036 --> 00:42:40,018
And especially the employee that caused this mess, he ought to definitely be taken out of pocket.

597
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:43,680
So it'll be money very well spent.

598
00:42:44,764 --> 00:42:48,605
Yeah.

599
00:42:49,645 --> 00:42:49,945
Okay.

600
00:42:50,265 --> 00:42:50,505
Okay.

601
00:42:50,806 --> 00:42:58,127
If somebody wants to put that in the form of a motion, is that how we used to do it, Alan, that you put in a form of a motion for this?

602
00:42:58,167 --> 00:42:58,467
Yeah.

603
00:42:58,748 --> 00:43:00,008
Yeah.

604
00:43:00,088 --> 00:43:00,668
Okay.

605
00:43:00,688 --> 00:43:05,869
And where are we going to put the warning in the form of the motion as well?

606
00:43:06,189 --> 00:43:08,310
Or is it just the training, Mr. Commissioner?

607
00:43:09,874 --> 00:43:11,495
I put the whole thing in it.

608
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:14,816
Do you want me to try and do the first one?

609
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:17,716
Yeah, yeah, that might be better.

610
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:34,261
I'd like to make a motion for the violation which occurred on June 24th at the Medford

611
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:40,958
Let's see what the official name is here, Method Wine and Spirits at 45 Salem Street.

612
00:43:43,099 --> 00:44:00,248
But this commission has heard from the police and the owners, and we have decided to put the licensee on probation for one year.

613
00:44:02,608 --> 00:44:15,832
and the employees that work at that license to all be TIP certified starting immediately and being completed within three months.

614
00:44:20,394 --> 00:44:20,734
Very good.

615
00:44:21,434 --> 00:44:22,454
Anybody want to second it?

616
00:44:23,054 --> 00:44:24,875
I second the motion.

617
00:44:25,835 --> 00:44:27,716
Okay, all those in favor, aye.

618
00:44:29,036 --> 00:44:29,136
Aye.

619
00:44:29,736 --> 00:44:29,837
Aye.

620
00:44:29,997 --> 00:44:30,857
All those opposed?

621
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:33,711
Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

622
00:44:34,612 --> 00:44:35,713
Motion's been passed.

623
00:44:37,394 --> 00:44:41,457
Mr. Patel, I hope we got something out of this, which I think we did.

624
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:57,468
And as a matter of fact, if you can do me a favor and report back to this commission, just to Daria, letting her know three months from now that all of your employees are now TIP certified.

625
00:44:58,865 --> 00:44:59,225
Yes, sir.

626
00:44:59,345 --> 00:45:00,807
I'll take care of that personally.

627
00:45:00,827 --> 00:45:02,268
Thank you, Bobby.

628
00:45:02,888 --> 00:45:03,069
Yes.

629
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:08,173
Maybe we could get a copy of the tip certification so we know it's been completed.

630
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:30,533
And it might even be advantageous, just looking at it a little deeper for everybody, that when you hire a new employee, you give them three months or 30 days to get TIP certified and provide you with a copy of that TIP certification.

631
00:45:30,573 --> 00:45:35,234
You don't have to send it to us, just keep it in your business on file from this point forward.

632
00:45:35,294 --> 00:45:41,436
But just your current employees, we'd want to keep an eye on that.

633
00:45:42,216 --> 00:45:43,016
Yes, definitely.

634
00:45:44,092 --> 00:45:44,352
Okay.

635
00:45:45,233 --> 00:45:45,533
Thank you.

636
00:45:46,734 --> 00:45:55,120
Are we good to go to the next?

637
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:03,286
Mr. Chairman, do you want to break here and jump over to D1 soccer?

638
00:46:03,326 --> 00:46:08,049
Did I see a representative from D1 soccer on here?

639
00:46:08,549 --> 00:46:10,151
All my little squares here are small.

640
00:46:10,631 --> 00:46:11,772
Can we jump back to that or no?

641
00:46:14,236 --> 00:46:17,357
Well, we do have D1 Soccer.

642
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:19,418
We've got Mr. Curley here as well.

643
00:46:19,758 --> 00:46:20,298
It's up to you.

644
00:46:20,598 --> 00:46:21,258
Yeah, that's fine.

645
00:46:21,398 --> 00:46:23,539
Let's do that.

646
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:30,481
I don't think it's going to be that involved for that long.

647
00:46:31,901 --> 00:46:32,461
Let's see.

648
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:35,802
D1 Soccer.

649
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:38,577
Yes.

650
00:46:39,277 --> 00:46:40,058
Mr. Georges.

651
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:40,998
Yes.

652
00:46:41,318 --> 00:46:41,979
I'm here.

653
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:43,900
I apologize for running away.

654
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,001
That's OK.

655
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:53,184
We had you slated to go at the beginning so we could get you out of here because this is going to be a little lengthy.

656
00:46:53,304 --> 00:46:57,826
But if you wouldn't mind, just state your name and organization for the record, please.

657
00:46:58,587 --> 00:46:59,347
Sure.

658
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:00,487
My name is Paul Georges.

659
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:07,631
I am the vice president of D1 Soccer League, local soccer league that plays at Harmel Stadium.

660
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:10,488
Okay, so thank you.

661
00:47:11,048 --> 00:47:15,749
You came before this commission last month, you presented well for two one day licenses.

662
00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:23,731
But there was a question about entertainment in the report of some possible sort of violation last year.

663
00:47:24,771 --> 00:47:29,652
And so at that point, we had a table your request.

664
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:31,633
This commission

665
00:47:33,495 --> 00:47:43,060
has not been able to find out the information to date about a possible violation of a previously granted license to D1 soccer.

666
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:54,165
And what I'm going to ask now, is there anyone in attendance that would like to speak in favor or against the granting of the two one-day licenses to D1 soccer?

667
00:48:01,402 --> 00:48:03,963
I see Mr. Curley, do you wanna speak?

668
00:48:05,943 --> 00:48:09,905
Yeah, so Kevin, Mr. Bailey's on vacation, so I'm stepping up on him.

669
00:48:10,545 --> 00:48:13,106
I am the facilities coordinator for recreation.

670
00:48:13,486 --> 00:48:21,828
Over the years past, the last couple of years, it seems like we've had a lot of things that have changed in this season.

671
00:48:22,128 --> 00:48:23,849
Could you speak up a little bit, Mr. Curley?

672
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:25,189
Yeah, I can.

673
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:26,890
It's not the greatest,

674
00:48:28,126 --> 00:48:29,848
It's not the greatest volume to be honest with you.

675
00:48:29,888 --> 00:48:30,549
Can you hear me now?

676
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:34,594
Yeah, I'll get as close as possible to my work computer.

677
00:48:35,055 --> 00:48:36,537
So, yeah, my name is John Curley.

678
00:48:36,597 --> 00:48:39,080
I'm facilities coordinator for recreation.

679
00:48:39,721 --> 00:48:41,643
Mr Bailey's on vacation this week.

680
00:48:41,663 --> 00:48:43,466
So he asked me if I can step in.

681
00:48:43,866 --> 00:48:50,032
So, over the last couple years, D1 Soccer has been working on the field at Pomelo Stadium.

682
00:48:50,573 --> 00:48:57,739
And it seems like we get a few emails every year about the noise and complaints about the fans and stuff in the parking lot.

683
00:48:59,882 --> 00:49:04,429
We're just trying to figure out what exactly has been going on because we get emails about complaints.

684
00:49:04,569 --> 00:49:08,575
And then about a month ago, I guess there was complaints that people were drinking.

685
00:49:09,456 --> 00:49:14,643
And I talked to Paul and he said that it was the fans drinking in the parking lot.

686
00:49:15,284 --> 00:49:19,806
So it's, um, at the end of the day, they were, people were drinking in the stadium.

687
00:49:20,146 --> 00:49:23,868
Yeah, they were, we just didn't know if it was actually D1 serving alcohol.

688
00:49:23,888 --> 00:49:26,209
They did serve these fruit like punches.

689
00:49:26,649 --> 00:49:29,870
Um, they once again said, there's no alcohol in those as well.

690
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:36,613
Um, we just been getting a few complaints about them every season, if I'm trying to be generally honest with everybody.

691
00:49:38,565 --> 00:49:40,189
Okay.

692
00:49:41,332 --> 00:49:45,603
Mr. Georges, do you have anything to say about that?

693
00:49:47,758 --> 00:49:55,723
So I did hear about the complaints in terms of like the noise and the alcohol that was possibly served in the place.

694
00:49:55,943 --> 00:49:57,003
We weren't aware of that.

695
00:49:57,844 --> 00:50:05,768
So we've put in additional measures to make sure that we have our security guards searching every bag that's coming in the stadium.

696
00:50:06,368 --> 00:50:08,890
The past couple of weeks since I've met

697
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:12,772
with the city in terms of, like, what's been going on.

698
00:50:13,232 --> 00:50:16,593
We've been making sure, like, the fans leave early after the game's over.

699
00:50:16,653 --> 00:50:20,375
We've been pushing them out of their parking lot.

700
00:50:21,135 --> 00:50:26,278
It's, and it's, to be honest, it's not, like, very hard to do.

701
00:50:27,158 --> 00:50:32,080
But it takes a few minutes to get everybody out because everybody's so excited about the game.

702
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:37,022
They tend to want to talk about the game, what happened and what they could have done better and stuff like that.

703
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:46,346
So we've just been trying to push them out and try to figure out like what other places that they can go hang out at, like a bar or something that is better than being hanging out at the parking lot.

704
00:50:46,366 --> 00:50:47,986
So that's just what we've been trying to push.

705
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:49,707
I see.

706
00:50:50,807 --> 00:50:51,108
Okay.

707
00:50:51,428 --> 00:50:51,508
And...

708
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:58,639
Mr. Curley, I just wanted to ask you one question, and I'm not sure if you have the answer.

709
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:04,326
It would probably be Mr. Bailey, but if this has been an issue in the past, how come

710
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:09,885
No one ever came before this commission to let us know.

711
00:51:09,905 --> 00:51:21,898
And the only reason why I'm asking that is because Mr. Georges came before us and he's gone through the effort of making out all the permit paperwork and coming before us and everything else.

712
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:33,074
We don't want to deny issuing them the licenses, but if there's been issues in the past, we can talk about it and see if we can get around it.

713
00:51:33,134 --> 00:51:49,929
So, you know, on the city's end or Mr. Bailey's end or whatever, if there are any future issues, I would suggest that you report them right away to this commission so we can bring in Mr. Georges and have him explain.

714
00:51:52,416 --> 00:52:07,648
One of the other things I wanted to ask too, I'm sure Mr. Georges, you've been in contact with the police detail desk and you hire police for this event because it's approximately 600 guests.

715
00:52:08,569 --> 00:52:08,849
Yeah.

716
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:09,990
I'm sorry.

717
00:52:13,025 --> 00:52:17,208
No, we're estimated it would be that because it's an actual event.

718
00:52:17,729 --> 00:52:26,055
I mean, barring that it doesn't rain, hopefully, we would be getting that kind of outcome.

719
00:52:26,255 --> 00:52:31,740
And we are reaching over to the police department to make sure that we have the proper security there.

720
00:52:32,642 --> 00:52:35,943
Okay, so you do hire details, correct?

721
00:52:36,603 --> 00:52:38,324
Yeah, we make the phone calls for the details.

722
00:52:38,344 --> 00:52:43,165
The details have not, the last couple of weeks we've been making the phone calls, they have not came.

723
00:52:43,505 --> 00:52:45,806
Prior to that, we were not.

724
00:52:46,306 --> 00:52:51,147
To John's defense, I think when he noticed that there were

725
00:52:51,147 --> 00:53:02,590
alcohol, and then he reached out to us and asked, you know, how could we not, like, go into the proper channels to make sure that we have the things that we need instead of seeing that illegally there.

726
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:10,932
So when he saw that, he reached out to me, and that's when we started making the right decisions to go with the proper channels to make sure we have the licenses and stuff.

727
00:53:10,972 --> 00:53:12,392
That's what the fans want.

728
00:53:13,512 --> 00:53:15,333
Okay, that's great.

729
00:53:15,453 --> 00:53:16,333
It's good that you do that.

730
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:19,554
Can I answer your question?

731
00:53:19,674 --> 00:53:20,234
Ask me a question.

732
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,461
Oh, I'm sorry.

733
00:53:21,761 --> 00:53:25,564
Yeah, so so basically last year they were called more music.

734
00:53:25,884 --> 00:53:29,967
We told him to shut down the music this season before the season started.

735
00:53:30,828 --> 00:53:32,369
I know it's a flyer at home.

736
00:53:32,429 --> 00:53:34,551
L saying there was going to be live music with DJ.

737
00:53:35,131 --> 00:53:37,653
So I emailed Mr. Paul.

738
00:53:37,693 --> 00:53:41,616
His email is our business partner before the season started this year.

739
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,878
If they were going to serve alcohol, we need a liquor license.

740
00:53:44,879 --> 00:53:45,560
No loud music.

741
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,401
And then all of a sudden I was hearing rumors.

742
00:53:49,002 --> 00:53:49,862
There was loud music.

743
00:53:49,882 --> 00:53:51,864
I got rid of that this year and then I was hearing rumors.

744
00:53:52,364 --> 00:53:57,588
There was alcohol, but I had no proof and that's why Mr. Georges went to you guys a month ago.

745
00:53:57,668 --> 00:54:02,471
So I've been doing my due diligence as a facilities coordinator to make sure there's nothing wrong there.

746
00:54:02,491 --> 00:54:10,736
So I did email D1 soccer before the season started this year to make sure they had all their proper licenses and I can forward that email if needed to be.

747
00:54:12,858 --> 00:54:12,938
OK.

748
00:54:14,227 --> 00:54:23,356
Mr. Chairman, if you don't mind, Mr. Georges, every time we have an event, it's a learning experience.

749
00:54:24,116 --> 00:54:28,000
As time goes on, you get damn good at running large venues.

750
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:43,331
Now that we know from Mr. Curley what the city concerns are and what some of the neighbors concerns have been, can you tell us what steps you're going to take to stop this?

751
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:45,193
Because Mr. Chairman is correct.

752
00:54:49,797 --> 00:55:14,072
you know when you come before us next year if we hear it was just insane and there was complaints left and right well then you know we didn't learn anything you know we didn't we didn't take the proper steps and and we look like fools for not you know not holding your feet to the fire and and you guys look like fools because you know your patrons go ah you know bring get that case put it over the fence you know

753
00:55:15,053 --> 00:55:28,622
So kind of tell us, at least for me, I want to know what you've learned from it, what steps you're going to take, and are you going to keep in mind the debriefing after a game?

754
00:55:28,702 --> 00:55:29,102
I get it.

755
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:30,703
Everybody wants to talk about the play.

756
00:55:30,763 --> 00:55:31,524
I get that.

757
00:55:32,024 --> 00:55:35,386
But it's the music also, because down there,

758
00:55:37,127 --> 00:55:42,049
especially in the night, that sound just carries all through those buildings.

759
00:55:42,529 --> 00:55:55,835
If you don't mind, you could spend a little time just giving us an overview of the steps that you're going to take to make sure this commission is comfortable issuing the one-day licenses for the 17th and the 31st.

760
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:57,036
If you don't mind, please.

761
00:55:58,276 --> 00:55:58,756
Sure.

762
00:55:58,916 --> 00:55:59,257
I think

763
00:56:01,063 --> 00:56:07,607
With knowing some of the boundaries of what needs to happen, we will have more of a program in our curriculum.

764
00:56:07,687 --> 00:56:12,410
It's just not something that we're winging in terms of bringing someone that just played music, whatever.

765
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:26,718
So if we know we're going to be playing music from this time to that time, it's only an hour's amount of time, then music is set at a reasonable interval, then we'll pretty much have more control of that.

766
00:56:27,438 --> 00:56:33,620
In terms of the people outside of the games, that's one thing we've been trying to push.

767
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:42,742
I've always been one of the last people to leave after the game because we like talking about the game and stuff like that.

768
00:56:42,922 --> 00:56:49,944
Being in contact with John and the rest of the city staff, we want to hear the reports of what the neighbors are thinking.

769
00:56:50,164 --> 00:56:51,845
We don't want to disturb anybody else.

770
00:56:52,705 --> 00:56:55,790
Everybody has a right to enjoyment of their own area that they live in.

771
00:56:55,850 --> 00:57:02,040
So if the noise is a little too late for some amount of time, we want to hear about it so we can get people out.

772
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:07,769
And that's what I've been doing is after the game, okay, guys, like within 30 minutes, everybody got to leave the parking lot.

773
00:57:08,349 --> 00:57:12,554
Uh, we can't have, um, cause you would hang out and not have their music in their cars.

774
00:57:12,614 --> 00:57:15,617
Like, okay, we'll say within 30 minutes, you got to get ready to go.

775
00:57:15,878 --> 00:57:19,442
That means that, that within that 30 minutes, you can't be playing a lot of music in your car either.

776
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:24,207
Um, and that's, that's what we've been doing, um, with all of our cleanup crew and our security staff.

777
00:57:30,765 --> 00:57:35,447
What about a possible suggestion that where I was getting, well, there's a couple of things.

778
00:57:36,027 --> 00:57:45,272
The first thing is I noticed on your application for one day license, and I believe last month, we did bring this up.

779
00:57:45,313 --> 00:57:47,974
We asked you if you were a nonprofit and you stated no.

780
00:57:50,525 --> 00:57:52,406
So we told you can only do beer and wine.

781
00:57:52,446 --> 00:57:55,768
There's no mixed drinks, no juices with that stuff.

782
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:58,110
Yeah.

783
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:01,452
So, you know, that's that's I just wanted to clarify that.

784
00:58:01,492 --> 00:58:17,221
The other thing where I was going with the police detail, I'd like very much maybe if Lieutenant Lockowitz could just make sure that the detail office and Mr. George contact each other.

785
00:58:18,242 --> 00:58:19,123
Let's see how many

786
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:23,675
Police detail officers are required.

787
00:58:23,695 --> 00:58:28,066
And is that something the officers could?

788
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:44,844
do at the end of this game, Lieutenant Lockowitz, is monitor the behavior and possibly clear out the parking lot, the disturbance of the peace, because right behind Harmel, it's all condos and apartments.

789
00:58:45,065 --> 00:58:52,371
It's just like, you know, these people are, you know, they'll put up with a little bit of it and stuff, but if it just gets- Yeah, there's high rises on both sides.

790
00:58:52,831 --> 00:58:54,732
High rises on both sides, yeah.

791
00:58:54,932 --> 00:59:00,555
You know, maybe the police detail, you'll pay the police detail until the parking lot is cleared.

792
00:59:01,235 --> 00:59:06,077
And, you know, that'll kind of push everybody to get out because it's costing you money.

793
00:59:06,978 --> 00:59:20,184
And Lieutenant Lockwood, where it is city property, I believe, or state property, I'm not sure what Cornell is, but, you know, with jurisdiction and all that stuff, I'm not really sure how that works on your end.

794
00:59:21,963 --> 00:59:25,105
We have utilized details in the past.

795
00:59:26,626 --> 00:59:31,769
Mr. Paul, is your organization D1 Soccer?

796
00:59:32,429 --> 00:59:32,669
Yes.

797
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:33,590
OK.

798
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:40,313
Because I know that we get requests for, I think it's called Galaxy Soccer.

799
00:59:40,874 --> 00:59:42,915
Is that a different organization than yours?

800
00:59:43,195 --> 00:59:44,476
That is not ours, no.

801
00:59:44,996 --> 00:59:46,357
OK.

802
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:49,278
Yeah, it's something you could consider.

803
00:59:51,094 --> 00:59:57,100
an expert on the policy as far as the requirement of a detail, but it's definitely an option.

804
00:59:58,301 --> 01:00:01,043
And I can I can.

805
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:13,515
We can get you that information, you can actually just call the main main desk in the police station and ask for the detail office that's staffed from usually from seven in the morning till 11 at night.

806
01:00:16,802 --> 01:00:22,226
I will just throw the asterisk in there that everybody is short-staffed.

807
01:00:22,326 --> 01:00:30,351
So you could put in the request, and it's a possibility that it won't be filled because of staffing demands.

808
01:00:32,792 --> 01:00:35,334
But yeah, it's something we could look at.

809
01:00:41,193 --> 01:00:46,755
Okay, well, you know, since we're at a point that, you know, we know what's going on, we know what's wrong.

810
01:00:47,495 --> 01:00:49,976
Mr. George, you're well aware of it.

811
01:00:50,576 --> 01:00:52,717
You know, you're gonna have some entertainment there.

812
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:55,498
I understand you gotta fire up the crowd a little bit, do whatever.

813
01:00:56,238 --> 01:00:58,959
But just keep it reasonable.

814
01:00:59,299 --> 01:01:06,602
And if you keep it reasonable and we get no complaints, then, you know, it's two one-day licenses.

815
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:28,632
You know, after hearing both sides and hearing what everybody thinks and what's gone by in the past, myself personally, I would feel comfortable granting the two licenses in the form of one motion and approving the one day license for August 17th, 2024.

816
01:01:32,428 --> 01:01:58,118
And for the license on August 31st, 2024, which is your second game or event, I would suggest granting it only in abidance of the 8-17-24 event, meaning if there are no issues on 8-17-24, the license for 8-31-24 will be granted as well automatically.

817
01:01:59,538 --> 01:02:01,779
If we've got issues, then

818
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:07,149
you would not be able to get the license on 831-24.

819
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:09,991
That's my feelings on it.

820
01:02:10,452 --> 01:02:19,499
I'd like to hear from my two fellow commissioners to see if they think that that is suffice or maybe should we just eliminate the music altogether?

821
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:21,861
I mean, the entertainment altogether.

822
01:02:21,881 --> 01:02:23,203
Let's just play soccer.

823
01:02:23,403 --> 01:02:25,184
You know, somebody wins, somebody loses.

824
01:02:25,264 --> 01:02:27,146
You talk about the game and it's over.

825
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:36,739
If you want to do that, then I won't hold, I won't suggest to hold your August 31st one day license and abidance.

826
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:44,321
I'd suggest to just go through with both of them since you don't have entertainment and there's nothing to rattle people about.

827
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:48,502
I mean, police are there, they got a detail, they can clear out the parking lot, that's great.

828
01:02:51,015 --> 01:02:55,016
I would be fine with the first suggestion you made that we could we could agree on both licenses.

829
01:02:55,316 --> 01:03:04,880
The second one being, you know, conditional that the first the first goes goes well and there's no issues, which I'm sure there will not be because now everybody's on notice that there's been issues in the past.

830
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,880
So I would be in favor of that Bobby.

831
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:09,401
Okay.

832
01:03:10,521 --> 01:03:14,363
Yeah, I'm, I'm wrestling with the whole thing because

833
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:17,354
I get it.

834
01:03:17,814 --> 01:03:23,576
You know, I get where you're going with your logic with the, you know, one is continued upon the other.

835
01:03:23,596 --> 01:03:26,696
I don't know.

836
01:03:26,776 --> 01:03:32,417
It's just that, you know, what constitutes, you know, the nullification of the 831?

837
01:03:32,918 --> 01:03:39,919
You know, what someone who's, I mean, we think about what we have down in South Medford.

838
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:43,620
There's a resident who forever was

839
01:03:44,782 --> 01:03:46,202
up in arms about the noise.

840
01:03:46,762 --> 01:03:48,623
The slightest noise, they were up in arms.

841
01:03:49,683 --> 01:03:54,244
And they had made their way all through the city to the mayor's office.

842
01:03:54,424 --> 01:03:56,185
I don't know.

843
01:03:57,045 --> 01:03:57,665
I don't know.

844
01:03:58,605 --> 01:04:00,185
I understand the logic.

845
01:04:01,266 --> 01:04:05,427
I just don't like one conditioned on the other.

846
01:04:06,147 --> 01:04:11,308
My thought would be to, since we had no idea of any of the,

847
01:04:12,198 --> 01:04:26,450
prior history to this events that I would say Mr. George is going to step up and they're going to do everything right to minimize the gathering and the drinking and the loud noise.

848
01:04:28,451 --> 01:04:33,495
Next year, it doesn't become a 100 percent challenge for us.

849
01:04:34,676 --> 01:04:45,106
That would be my thought, my recommendation would be to just approve both licenses, the 817 and the 831st.

850
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:52,993
We roll the dice and we hope that Mr. Georges takes care of all the loose ends.

851
01:04:55,115 --> 01:04:59,820
Next year when he comes before us again, we'll say, congratulations, you did a great job.

852
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:02,032
Bang, zoom, it's done.

853
01:05:02,192 --> 01:05:07,795
That would be my thought, but like I said, that's one versus the two others.

854
01:05:11,016 --> 01:05:16,099
Can I ask you, Mr. Georges, is there a possibility that we can omit the entertainment?

855
01:05:18,557 --> 01:05:26,820
No, I think the entertainment is the big part of the league and how we would improve, like, the league itself.

856
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:30,981
I mean, just thinking about other measures that we can put.

857
01:05:31,021 --> 01:05:38,344
We can put, like, sound interval measurements around and see how it's affecting in certain areas, how loud it's getting.

858
01:05:38,364 --> 01:05:40,565
Like, we can think outside the box.

859
01:05:41,986 --> 01:05:44,950
And how really, because like I said, we want to entertain the fans.

860
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:46,052
We want the league to get better.

861
01:05:46,092 --> 01:05:52,542
We also don't want to, like, disturb everybody and because everybody has the right to enjoy their neighborhood.

862
01:05:53,488 --> 01:05:53,748
Yeah.

863
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:55,610
I thought we could compromise a little bit.

864
01:05:55,690 --> 01:06:03,536
Maybe you can just kind of like take your speakers and turn them around towards the school and Route 93, towards the bleachers.

865
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:09,541
I'm in favor of what Mr. Commissioner Matarano has said.

866
01:06:09,781 --> 01:06:18,528
I do think that we've discussed this enough and he's got to run his league here and I don't want to tinker with how he operates and what drives 600 people.

867
01:06:18,548 --> 01:06:20,750
600 people aren't going to come if it's not a fun event.

868
01:06:21,450 --> 01:06:24,511
Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.

869
01:06:24,771 --> 01:06:28,151
We all know with sporting events is the sporting event.

870
01:06:28,292 --> 01:06:31,892
And then there's the show.

871
01:06:32,032 --> 01:06:32,892
So I get that.

872
01:06:33,013 --> 01:06:38,074
So it goes till eight and then get people out of the parking lot and no sitting around drinking in the parking lot.

873
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:39,434
I mean, everyone wants that.

874
01:06:41,194 --> 01:06:43,795
Again, that would be my thought.

875
01:06:43,815 --> 01:06:44,035
Let's

876
01:06:44,535 --> 01:06:44,775
Yeah.

877
01:06:44,815 --> 01:06:45,917
Let's roll the dice.

878
01:06:46,137 --> 01:06:52,464
Mr. Georges will think about our concerns because he'll know he has to come back to us next year.

879
01:06:52,524 --> 01:06:55,027
And it may be different.

880
01:06:55,107 --> 01:06:59,492
It may be a no the next time because of all the commotion.

881
01:07:00,973 --> 01:07:01,654
That's fine.

882
01:07:02,014 --> 01:07:04,317
One of you gentlemen want to put it in the form of a motion?

883
01:07:04,337 --> 01:07:05,018
We'll push through.

884
01:07:05,484 --> 01:07:19,877
Yeah, I motion that we approve that both one day licenses, August 17th and August 31st at Hormel for the D1 Soccer League and music performance.

885
01:07:20,817 --> 01:07:30,386
And we'll cross our fingers that all the proper steps are taken to have a successful uneventful event.

886
01:07:30,406 --> 01:07:32,948
If you know what I mean, uneventful.

887
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:35,705
I'll second that motion.

888
01:07:36,688 --> 01:07:37,089
Okay.

889
01:07:37,370 --> 01:07:37,992
All in favor?

890
01:07:38,614 --> 01:07:38,754
Aye.

891
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:39,195
Aye.

892
01:07:40,118 --> 01:07:40,640
All opposed?

893
01:07:42,268 --> 01:07:43,948
Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

894
01:07:44,409 --> 01:07:48,790
Your one day licenses have been granted, Mr. George.

895
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:50,010
You know what you need to do.

896
01:07:50,270 --> 01:07:54,471
And if you would, please contact the police department detail desk.

897
01:07:54,911 --> 01:08:00,853
And I think it'd be very beneficial just to have presence there, especially after the event.

898
01:08:00,933 --> 01:08:02,593
And I think it'll work out okay.

899
01:08:02,673 --> 01:08:04,914
And hopefully we'll see you next year.

900
01:08:05,094 --> 01:08:07,795
Mr. Georges, you said 600 people?

901
01:08:10,017 --> 01:08:10,237
Yes.

902
01:08:10,357 --> 01:08:14,019
Yeah, you absolutely have to have probably two details.

903
01:08:14,759 --> 01:08:15,479
Okay.

904
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:17,660
I'm sending you the phone number right now.

905
01:08:19,881 --> 01:08:22,722
Like I texted it to you on the side.

906
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,483
That's the detail office number.

907
01:08:25,423 --> 01:08:25,703
Okay.

908
01:08:26,483 --> 01:08:26,944
Yeah.

909
01:08:27,204 --> 01:08:31,065
And whoever answers the phone, there's an officer, there's a sergeant that work in there.

910
01:08:31,085 --> 01:08:35,267
They'll be happy to discuss it with you and how the billing and all that stuff works.

911
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:36,740
Yeah.

912
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:37,480
Thank you very much.

913
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:42,021
Mr. Georges, I was in England on July 10th when they played the Netherlands.

914
01:08:42,822 --> 01:08:43,382
Oh, nice.

915
01:08:44,022 --> 01:08:46,943
Wild, wild, wild.

916
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:49,223
So I get it.

917
01:08:49,303 --> 01:08:51,784
So good luck.

918
01:08:52,064 --> 01:08:55,445
I hope it doesn't rain, but the rain's not going to stop the athletes.

919
01:08:57,705 --> 01:08:58,125
Good luck.

920
01:08:58,426 --> 01:08:58,986
Best of luck.

921
01:09:00,206 --> 01:09:00,886
Thank you very much.

922
01:09:00,906 --> 01:09:01,506
Appreciate it.

923
01:09:01,526 --> 01:09:02,287
Appreciate everyone.

924
01:09:02,967 --> 01:09:03,867
Good luck, Mr. Georges.

925
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,460
Have a good day.

926
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:12,323
Okay, back to, let's get back to the violations portion of the meeting.

927
01:09:14,264 --> 01:09:15,685
Lieutenant, if you want to.

928
01:09:17,666 --> 01:09:18,206
Absolutely.

929
01:09:18,906 --> 01:09:22,888
Just keeping it chronologically, we had three violations on June 20th.

930
01:09:24,129 --> 01:09:24,989
We did the first.

931
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:32,973
I see Officer Sebastian sitting there patiently, so I'll grab his report next.

932
01:09:36,316 --> 01:09:39,698
For Hillside, 323 Boston Ave.

933
01:09:41,058 --> 01:09:41,278
Okay.

934
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:48,302
The report starts off with the same paragraph about the 16 year old who was given the breathalyzer.

935
01:09:49,142 --> 01:09:52,944
We can just pop down to the violation part when the check was done.

936
01:09:53,885 --> 01:09:55,606
I'll turn it over to Officer Sebastian.

937
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,976
Okay, so this one's pretty short and sweet.

938
01:09:59,036 --> 01:10:08,859
So at approximately 7.45, the juvenile entered Hillside Wine and Spirits at 323 Boston Avenue in an attempt to buy an alcoholic beverage.

939
01:10:08,879 --> 01:10:15,681
Approximately three minutes later, the juvenile exited Hillside Wine and Spirits with a 12-pack of Truly Side Seltzer.

940
01:10:15,701 --> 01:10:18,682
The juvenile informed myself and Ms.

941
01:10:18,702 --> 01:10:20,923
Greenbaum that a short, possibly

942
01:10:23,161 --> 01:10:29,025
Southeastern Asian male, approximately 40 to 50 years old, wearing a blue shirt and glasses, sold her the alcohol.

943
01:10:29,685 --> 01:10:33,848
At no point did the employee ask the juvenile for an ID or her age.

944
01:10:34,729 --> 01:10:45,316
The juvenile also informed us that her purchase was $20.09, and that she only had the marked $20 bill, and the employee told her she was all set.

945
01:10:47,517 --> 01:10:49,759
The juvenile then,

946
01:10:50,893 --> 01:10:54,834
gave me the alcohol, I exited my unmarked cruiser.

947
01:10:55,754 --> 01:11:05,597
As I began to walk towards the store, the tribune noted that there was a large sign on the door that said no ID, no sale, in all capital letters.

948
01:11:06,697 --> 01:11:11,458
I was then greeted by the employee who also identified as the owner and

949
01:11:12,025 --> 01:11:16,466
excuse my pronunciation on the name, Dharmendra Patel.

950
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:24,388
I identified myself with my Mefford police badge as a Mefford police officer and informed Mr. Patel that he had just sold alcohol to a minor.

951
01:11:25,628 --> 01:11:32,690
Mr. Patel was extremely upset and regretful and stated multiple times, I promised you this will never happen again.

952
01:11:32,710 --> 01:11:40,312
I informed Mr. Patel that I would be reporting my findings to the Liquor Commission and that I would be on file with the Mefford police.

953
01:11:41,444 --> 01:11:44,245
Mr. Patel returned the Mark $20 bill.

954
01:11:44,705 --> 01:11:49,727
I returned the merchandise and I advise them to check all IDs in the future to prevent this from happening again.

955
01:11:53,189 --> 01:11:53,989
Okay, very good.

956
01:11:54,569 --> 01:11:57,070
Thank you.

957
01:11:57,090 --> 01:11:58,491
Mr. Patel, would you care to speak?

958
01:12:01,412 --> 01:12:03,593
Yes, my name is Rahul Patel.

959
01:12:03,793 --> 01:12:06,634
I'm owner of Hillside Wine and Spirits.

960
01:12:07,593 --> 01:12:13,396
Thank you, officer, for the summary and hello to the commissioner.

961
01:12:13,416 --> 01:12:32,527
So, yeah, with this, you know, again, it is, you know, again, I was extremely disappointed with the sale, meaning I definitely know the importance of the underage, meaning there is a license for a reason.

962
01:12:33,487 --> 01:12:50,985
And as you mentioned in the previous one that we went through, meaning that there was this October, I believe, meeting that was a joint ABCC and Medford Commission licensing training.

963
01:12:51,565 --> 01:12:52,706
So, we made sure that the

964
01:12:53,507 --> 01:13:01,092
The manager that was on site that day when this took place, he was there for the training.

965
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:02,233
This is back in October 2023.

966
01:13:02,273 --> 01:13:10,619
It was a citywide, all the liquor stores were asked to attend and it was a joint with ABCC.

967
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:12,440
So he did attend the training.

968
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:18,484
Other things, TIPS certification, you know, was one thing that was brought up.

969
01:13:18,524 --> 01:13:26,050
So I'm just kind of going through the things that were asked, but then we can go through, you know, other questions or comments you may have.

970
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:32,233
But TIPS certification is something that was done.

971
01:13:32,253 --> 01:13:40,437
I do want to be honest or transparent that the license or the certification did expire.

972
01:13:41,058 --> 01:13:43,819
I was under the impression it was more like four years to five years.

973
01:13:44,499 --> 01:13:52,503
But it seems like it was from 2020 June, July through June, July of last year.

974
01:13:52,583 --> 01:13:53,284
So it expired 2023.

975
01:13:56,926 --> 01:14:03,248
I have asked the manager and all the employees to make sure that they do recertify.

976
01:14:03,468 --> 01:14:04,229
It is important.

977
01:14:05,129 --> 01:14:19,775
It's a quick, I wouldn't say quick, it's about two, three hours of online certification training that they have to go through, which I recall we've done that a few years back.

978
01:14:21,213 --> 01:14:21,914
So that's that.

979
01:14:22,935 --> 01:14:34,465
And then, you know, the ID check, we do take that very seriously, meaning us especially being right on the campus of Tufts, you know, the location, meaning we

980
01:14:36,486 --> 01:14:40,612
I would say, get dozens and dozens of these licenses, right?

981
01:14:40,853 --> 01:14:50,687
There is tip certification type of training that gets put in place, but we also have age ID check, which is like, one law.

982
01:14:53,712 --> 01:14:58,373
and tracking, meaning we have a device.

983
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:01,674
So this incident is truly a one-off, I would say.

984
01:15:01,694 --> 01:15:08,436
And I would assure that we are very, very careful, and we do take this seriously going forward.

985
01:15:12,577 --> 01:15:12,857
OK.

986
01:15:13,657 --> 01:15:14,618
Thank you, Mr. Patel.

987
01:15:18,119 --> 01:15:19,959
What I feel is fair that we should

988
01:15:23,988 --> 01:15:44,625
make a motion for the same requirements for Hillside Lookers as we did for Main Street Lookers, that all of the employees must be TIP certified and starting immediately, finishing by 30 day, or would we say 90 days, right?

989
01:15:44,645 --> 01:15:45,446
90 days.

990
01:15:46,346 --> 01:15:46,586
90 days.

991
01:15:47,527 --> 01:15:52,791
And this will go into your file and you will be on probation for one year.

992
01:15:54,073 --> 01:16:00,880
Um, and, uh, I guess that would probably be just about it.

993
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,883
How do you like fellow commissioners feels this?

994
01:16:03,963 --> 01:16:04,303
Okay.

995
01:16:04,883 --> 01:16:06,905
Yeah, Mr Chairman.

996
01:16:07,065 --> 01:16:08,227
Oh, go ahead, Mr Patel.

997
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:26,754
No, sorry, I just wanted to put it in my defense where, again, like I said, this DIP certification, meaning I can share my screen, I do have a copy of it and show the name, the manager's name, but it is, to be transparent, it did expire mid last year, 2023.

998
01:16:28,635 --> 01:16:47,546
The other thing I would say is this ABCC and Medford town, which had the alcohol sale and that whole seminar, which was very well organized, I should say, in October, meaning we did have a strong presence or attendance there as well.

999
01:16:48,287 --> 01:16:52,990
Age ID, meaning, again, if I am able to share my screen, I can show you

1000
01:16:54,047 --> 01:16:55,208
stacks of IDs.

1001
01:16:55,488 --> 01:16:58,710
Again, we don't give this back to the kids.

1002
01:16:59,111 --> 01:16:59,851
We take them.

1003
01:17:00,191 --> 01:17:06,676
Yes, there may end up some arguments because they own it and they paid, but it's just we don't return it to them.

1004
01:17:07,116 --> 01:17:16,022
If I may, I can share my screen if you would like to show a real stack from the store that we just gather.

1005
01:17:16,563 --> 01:17:18,184
And it's just the norm.

1006
01:17:18,264 --> 01:17:19,265
You mentioned earlier.

1007
01:17:20,045 --> 01:17:20,966
Yeah, we don't doubt it.

1008
01:17:21,746 --> 01:17:23,907
Mr. Patel, we appreciate that you're doing that.

1009
01:17:23,927 --> 01:17:40,574
Again, I just want to make sure that the employee that committed the infraction is well aware of the severity of the incident and that you guys are taking the necessary steps to educate the individual so it doesn't happen again.

1010
01:17:40,594 --> 01:17:46,577
And as I was saying, the Patel family, they're brilliant.

1011
01:17:46,677 --> 01:17:48,038
You guys are very smart.

1012
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:54,539
very savvy and I know you'll take the right steps to resolve the issue.

1013
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:59,761
I think, again, one bite of the apple.

1014
01:18:00,241 --> 01:18:05,442
I totally agree with the commissioner's recommendation.

1015
01:18:06,702 --> 01:18:15,764
Ben, I don't know about what your thoughts are, but I think it's fair for first-time offenders and we start building a jacket.

1016
01:18:16,144 --> 01:18:16,765
You know what I mean?

1017
01:18:16,805 --> 01:18:17,905
Like a little file there.

1018
01:18:18,745 --> 01:18:23,909
And then if something happens again, we pull it out and we go, ah, it's a trend.

1019
01:18:23,989 --> 01:18:24,869
It's not a one-off.

1020
01:18:24,989 --> 01:18:29,352
So I'm good with the commissioner's recommendation.

1021
01:18:29,712 --> 01:18:30,633
Ben, what say you?

1022
01:18:31,213 --> 01:18:33,275
I'm good with the commissioner's recommendation as well.

1023
01:18:35,293 --> 01:18:36,113
Okay, great.

1024
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:39,715
If one of you would make it in the form of a motion.

1025
01:18:39,855 --> 01:18:41,395
Actually, just one other quick thing.

1026
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:44,536
Mr. Patel, we are going to have a compliance seminar.

1027
01:18:44,616 --> 01:18:48,018
We're shooting for near the end of September with the ABCC.

1028
01:18:49,078 --> 01:18:51,379
And you'll be notified when it is.

1029
01:18:51,879 --> 01:18:56,260
It's going to be another mandatory attendance for all licensees in the city.

1030
01:18:56,901 --> 01:18:57,441
And thank you.

1031
01:18:57,501 --> 01:18:58,421
Thank you for attending.

1032
01:18:58,641 --> 01:19:03,023
And, you know, I'm sure you've gotten something out of it.

1033
01:19:04,588 --> 01:19:05,370
Anyways, I'm sorry.

1034
01:19:06,192 --> 01:19:08,378
One of my fellow commissioners want to make a motion.

1035
01:19:08,959 --> 01:19:09,922
Yeah, I could do that.

1036
01:19:10,263 --> 01:19:10,824
Okay.

1037
01:19:11,406 --> 01:19:11,686
All right.

1038
01:19:11,746 --> 01:19:12,909
I'll make a motion to.

1039
01:19:14,641 --> 01:19:22,988
Uh, for hillside wine and spirits that we're going to place them on a 1 year probation, um, for, uh, for the violation of under serving to underage.

1040
01:19:24,109 --> 01:19:27,892
And also that we're going to require that they're all employees.

1041
01:19:27,932 --> 01:19:33,617
They have serving alcohol are going to be getting tip certified in the next 3 months.

1042
01:19:34,918 --> 01:19:39,141
Sending those certifications to Daria at Medford City Hall.

1043
01:19:40,703 --> 01:19:41,143
Very good.

1044
01:19:41,283 --> 01:19:42,164
Thanks Ben.

1045
01:19:42,524 --> 01:19:43,465
I second that motion.

1046
01:19:44,808 --> 01:19:45,628
All those in favor?

1047
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:46,469
Aye.

1048
01:19:47,469 --> 01:19:48,250
All those opposed?

1049
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:52,412
Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it, the motion's been passed.

1050
01:19:53,613 --> 01:19:54,493
Thank you, Mr. Patel.

1051
01:19:54,673 --> 01:19:55,334
Thank you, Mr. Patel.

1052
01:19:55,354 --> 01:19:55,614
Thank you.

1053
01:19:55,974 --> 01:19:56,655
Appreciate your time.

1054
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:57,215
Thank you.

1055
01:19:57,975 --> 01:19:58,255
Bye-bye.

1056
01:19:59,856 --> 01:20:00,537
Okay, Lieutenant.

1057
01:20:02,098 --> 01:20:07,440
All right, moving along, the last violation on June 20th.

1058
01:20:10,214 --> 01:20:13,396
was a restaurant that was Blue Fuji at 38 Salem Street.

1059
01:20:14,997 --> 01:20:20,239
This report was done by Officer Smith, who's in the screen there.

1060
01:20:23,281 --> 01:20:30,184
The only difference to the prior reports is that there are two juveniles referred to as JV1 and JV2.

1061
01:20:30,224 --> 01:20:31,885
They're both 17 year old males.

1062
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:40,242
And they were instructed to go into the restaurant and order a Bud Light.

1063
01:20:40,482 --> 01:20:47,587
And I'll pass it over to Officer Smith for the violation.

1064
01:20:48,547 --> 01:20:49,108
Hello, everyone.

1065
01:20:49,148 --> 01:20:51,269
I'm Officer Patrick Smith with Memphis Police.

1066
01:20:52,270 --> 01:20:58,474
On June 20th, 2024, we conducted a compliance check at Blue Fuji, located at 38 Salem Street.

1067
01:20:58,714 --> 01:21:02,536
I was with Miss Dhingra and two juvenile males, age 17.

1068
01:21:05,071 --> 01:21:11,016
At about 6.20 p.m., the two juvenile males entered Blue Fuji.

1069
01:21:12,057 --> 01:21:15,360
Within about five minutes, they sent a message to Ms.

1070
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,823
Dhingra stating they had been served an alcoholic beverage.

1071
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:21,731
At that time, I went into the restaurant.

1072
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:27,892
I observed the restaurant to be empty other than a hostess, a server, and a bartender.

1073
01:21:27,972 --> 01:21:31,033
There were no other patrons or staff members visible.

1074
01:21:32,394 --> 01:21:37,375
I observed the two males sitting at a booth in front of them with two Bud Light bottles.

1075
01:21:38,436 --> 01:21:39,536
I approached the table.

1076
01:21:39,836 --> 01:21:42,277
I asked them who served them the alcohol.

1077
01:21:43,152 --> 01:21:46,333
and they pointed to a gentleman who was later identified.

1078
01:21:46,413 --> 01:21:50,934
I'm not going to get the name correctly, but I believe it's Ziyi Ouyang.

1079
01:21:52,074 --> 01:21:52,975
He was the server.

1080
01:21:53,235 --> 01:21:54,235
They pointed towards him.

1081
01:21:54,595 --> 01:22:00,997
I asked the juveniles if they had asked for identification, which they did not.

1082
01:22:01,317 --> 01:22:04,158
I asked the juveniles if they asked for their age.

1083
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:08,431
And once again, they said that they had not been asked their age.

1084
01:22:08,932 --> 01:22:10,853
They just ordered the Bud Lights and were served.

1085
01:22:11,633 --> 01:22:16,375
So then I thanked the juveniles, and I asked them to return to the vehicle, and Miss Dingle was waiting.

1086
01:22:17,575 --> 01:22:21,917
I then motioned towards the server and had him come over to the booth.

1087
01:22:22,658 --> 01:22:27,420
He was identified, and he gave me the following,

1088
01:22:30,323 --> 01:22:34,646
He stated that he didn't ask for ID, he didn't ask for their age.

1089
01:22:35,526 --> 01:22:41,650
He thought they were tough students and that he usually doesn't ask for identification if the person looks over the age of 30.

1090
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:48,954
He said he'd only been working there a couple months and that the manager was not working that night and was on vacation.

1091
01:22:50,014 --> 01:22:54,577
I explained to the server, the hostess, and the bartender the importance of underage

1092
01:22:55,522 --> 01:22:57,684
and they have to check IDs if they look young.

1093
01:22:58,044 --> 01:23:00,666
I mean, these juveniles males look very young.

1094
01:23:01,487 --> 01:23:06,791
And I explained to them that a report would be generated and it would be submitted to the commission.

1095
01:23:11,494 --> 01:23:11,835
Very good.

1096
01:23:12,135 --> 01:23:15,698
Thank you very much.

1097
01:23:16,678 --> 01:23:17,039
Okay.

1098
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:21,382
Would someone from, is anyone from Blue Sochi here and would they like to speak?

1099
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,861
Do we have an employee from Blue Fuji?

1100
01:23:38,943 --> 01:23:41,545
We might not, Bobby.

1101
01:23:41,565 --> 01:23:42,605
I'm not sure.

1102
01:23:42,625 --> 01:23:44,406
Let me see.

1103
01:23:44,767 --> 01:23:46,007
Blue Fuji replied to me.

1104
01:23:46,027 --> 01:23:55,132
I don't think they did.

1105
01:23:55,152 --> 01:23:57,233
I don't see them.

1106
01:23:57,994 --> 01:24:00,595
Mr. Commissioner, why don't we table this one?

1107
01:24:04,871 --> 01:24:19,757
I'm sure we're going to have to, Ellen, but just a matter of information, if a person does not appear, have the notification.

1108
01:24:21,858 --> 01:24:24,619
Yeah, because I emailed and mailed, so.

1109
01:24:25,419 --> 01:24:29,621
Right, and that's why we emailed and mailed.

1110
01:24:33,228 --> 01:24:41,471
if they don't appear, failure to appear could face indefinite suspension of their license starting immediately.

1111
01:24:42,171 --> 01:24:50,553
I don't know if I wanna go that strong.

1112
01:24:51,634 --> 01:25:01,657
Maybe diarrhea can reach out to them today, tomorrow, and maybe schedule them to appear

1113
01:25:03,175 --> 01:25:03,795
in September.

1114
01:25:04,756 --> 01:25:08,338
Um, I mean, I really don't want to suspend their license.

1115
01:25:09,059 --> 01:25:11,721
There might have been a communication issue there.

1116
01:25:12,441 --> 01:25:12,921
I don't know.

1117
01:25:13,101 --> 01:25:15,403
We're giving the benefit of the doubt is my feelings.

1118
01:25:15,603 --> 01:25:17,885
I don't know the two other commissioners.

1119
01:25:17,925 --> 01:25:18,745
So you feel the same?

1120
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:24,369
Well, Mr Chairman, if you don't mind, can I address a question to Officer Smith?

1121
01:25:26,596 --> 01:25:38,865
Officer Smith, um, in some of the narratives in the police reports, they talk about, um, not the culprit, but the person who committed the infraction showing little or no remorse.

1122
01:25:39,905 --> 01:25:43,668
Um, because to me, that's Fuji.

1123
01:25:43,708 --> 01:25:44,768
Was that the case there?

1124
01:25:44,808 --> 01:25:49,912
Because if they had little or no remorse, or they didn't, they were concerned

1125
01:25:50,635 --> 01:25:58,622
that they got caught in a controlled compliance check, and then they don't even give us the respect to show up on the day of their hearing.

1126
01:25:58,642 --> 01:26:01,985
I think they've just compounded matters.

1127
01:26:02,065 --> 01:26:08,131
So what was your observation at the time of the infraction?

1128
01:26:09,272 --> 01:26:10,933
The server was very apologetic.

1129
01:26:11,874 --> 01:26:13,336
He did show remorse.

1130
01:26:15,245 --> 01:26:23,792
The hostess and the bartender, they just nodded their head to what I was explaining to them, but the server was very apologetic.

1131
01:26:24,533 --> 01:26:30,958
He said he had only been working there for a few months and he knew better, and he said it wouldn't happen again.

1132
01:26:31,058 --> 01:26:33,420
I just made a mistake, and all of a sudden, okay.

1133
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:48,883
Okay, then that's good enough for me that maybe this here is just, you know, everybody is complaining about help and maybe they just couldn't, someone couldn't break away to participate.

1134
01:26:48,923 --> 01:26:56,705
But again, I think we could table this, Mr. Chairman, and revisit it in August.

1135
01:26:57,465 --> 01:26:59,446
Again, August is when we're normally off.

1136
01:26:59,686 --> 01:27:02,346
I'd hate to have just one hearing for that.

1137
01:27:03,047 --> 01:27:04,347
I'll push it to September.

1138
01:27:06,088 --> 01:27:07,269
I don't know what your thoughts are.

1139
01:27:09,651 --> 01:27:20,101
Possibly push it to September and at the September meeting, we'll send them out another notification because we normally don't meet in August.

1140
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:23,304
Whether we meet in August or September, it's not gonna make a bit of difference.

1141
01:27:23,564 --> 01:27:29,489
So why don't we just set them up for September so it doesn't inconvenience this commission as well.

1142
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:50,858
And I think we should set a stricter penalty, possibly a small suspension for them not knowing, for them not showing at this meeting and show that we mean business when we tell them we want them to appear before the commission.

1143
01:27:51,594 --> 01:27:52,294
I agree with that.

1144
01:27:52,334 --> 01:27:53,795
And we can issue it at that time.

1145
01:27:54,275 --> 01:27:54,595
Sure.

1146
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:56,036
What about Officer Smith?

1147
01:27:56,096 --> 01:28:04,159
Are we going to have him bring him back in September or his narrative of the police report is enough for the record?

1148
01:28:05,917 --> 01:28:08,179
And that's up to the lieutenant.

1149
01:28:08,459 --> 01:28:15,544
I think the lieutenant usually like when you have cases in court and stuff, the officer is supposed to be present, correct?

1150
01:28:16,585 --> 01:28:17,125
Absolutely.

1151
01:28:17,665 --> 01:28:26,531
Historically, I know we got away from it over the last couple of years, but we've started anew with Officer Smith and Sebastian becoming members of the commission.

1152
01:28:27,973 --> 01:28:29,054
in, I believe, October.

1153
01:28:29,854 --> 01:28:44,347
Historically, it would only be me, but now there are three of us, is at every commission meeting, just whether it's for advice, guidance, or, you know, what have you.

1154
01:28:45,708 --> 01:28:54,336
So I definitely have Officer Smith at the next meeting, and we'll work it out to have at least one of us at each meeting going forward.

1155
01:28:56,668 --> 01:28:57,268
Yeah, that's great.

1156
01:28:57,849 --> 01:28:58,910
We could use your advice.

1157
01:29:00,691 --> 01:29:18,144
I have seen, for past precedent, I have seen suspended, suspended, suspended, doubling up on the word, almost like in a probationary, a suspension, suspended period.

1158
01:29:19,005 --> 01:29:21,787
So I've seen like a day of suspension hungover.

1159
01:29:23,121 --> 01:29:28,923
if the infraction occurs again, then that day is then inflicted.

1160
01:29:29,623 --> 01:29:47,030
I think what you might be referring to is like maybe a second violation that we'd recommend the one day suspension held in abidance for a year and kind of hanging it over their head.

1161
01:29:48,745 --> 01:29:50,646
do the right thing, then we don't suspend.

1162
01:29:51,367 --> 01:29:59,552
And that might be something that, you know, we could look at for a possible thing for Blue Fuji.

1163
01:29:59,572 --> 01:30:08,939
But anyways, we'll have Daria reach out to them and we'll table it until September if one of you gentlemen want to put that in the form of a motion.

1164
01:30:10,871 --> 01:30:12,452
Yeah, I'll do this one.

1165
01:30:12,472 --> 01:30:17,453
I motion that we have- I'm sorry, Ben, did you want to speak on this, Ben?

1166
01:30:17,633 --> 01:30:20,694
No, no, I was in agreement with what you said, Mr. Commissioner.

1167
01:30:20,714 --> 01:30:22,375
Okay, I'm sorry.

1168
01:30:23,175 --> 01:30:32,158
Yeah, no, I was gonna just make a motion to table Blue Fuji until the official meeting in September, the third Wednesday in September.

1169
01:30:35,459 --> 01:30:37,559
Anything else do I need to add to that, Mr. Chairman?

1170
01:30:40,240 --> 01:30:43,121
No, then have Darian notify them again.

1171
01:30:43,441 --> 01:30:45,081
Right, and have Darian, yes.

1172
01:30:45,501 --> 01:30:48,842
Registered mail return receipt requested type of thing.

1173
01:30:49,322 --> 01:30:49,562
Yeah.

1174
01:30:51,722 --> 01:30:52,943
Just so we know to get it.

1175
01:30:53,443 --> 01:30:56,203
Okay, so that would be my motion to, yeah.

1176
01:30:57,104 --> 01:30:58,284
I'll second that then.

1177
01:30:58,384 --> 01:30:58,644
Okay.

1178
01:31:03,765 --> 01:31:05,725
Mr. Chairman, you want me to continue on?

1179
01:31:06,786 --> 01:31:07,646
Go right ahead, Lieutenant.

1180
01:31:08,734 --> 01:31:09,074
All right.

1181
01:31:09,134 --> 01:31:13,576
So six days later, same scenario.

1182
01:31:13,657 --> 01:31:15,637
I was working in the shift at the station.

1183
01:31:16,358 --> 01:31:22,961
Officer Sebastian Smith, as well as Catherine Dinger and Sophie Greenbaum.

1184
01:31:26,503 --> 01:31:30,565
On June 26, we did another continued on with the checks.

1185
01:31:30,585 --> 01:31:33,767
There's too many to do in one evening on the 26th.

1186
01:31:37,081 --> 01:31:40,223
For Officer Smith, we'll just go in chronological order.

1187
01:31:42,264 --> 01:31:49,209
Officer Smith had a 16-year-old female and a 17-year-old female with him, with Ms.

1188
01:31:49,249 --> 01:31:55,994
Greenbaum, to do restaurants, and I guess you could say on-premise.

1189
01:31:58,256 --> 01:32:03,179
And this first report is Hyatt Place at 116 Riverside Ave.

1190
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:06,538
Okay.

1191
01:32:08,721 --> 01:32:22,414
Well, again, Officer Smith, I just want to start out by saying that when we do the compliance checks at the restaurants and the hotels, if they are to be served, we have the juvenile or the underage remain with the alcohol.

1192
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:26,698
We want to observe it in front of them when we enter the establishment.

1193
01:32:27,379 --> 01:32:36,964
However, we do notify these juveniles that at any time, during any of the compliance checks, they do not feel comfortable there to get up and just walk away.

1194
01:32:37,544 --> 01:32:43,447
We expressly tell them it's their safety, it's their, we want them to be comfortable.

1195
01:32:43,547 --> 01:32:45,929
And if any time they're not, they're to get up and walk out.

1196
01:32:46,729 --> 01:32:48,110
So I'm gonna begin with the hired police.

1197
01:32:49,390 --> 01:32:50,931
On June 26th,

1198
01:32:52,742 --> 01:32:54,703
I did the compliance check with Ms.

1199
01:32:54,723 --> 01:32:58,865
Greenbaum and a 17-year-old and a 16-year-old female.

1200
01:33:00,165 --> 01:33:08,629
At approximately 6.20 p.m., two juveniles entered the Hyatt and went to the bar.

1201
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:10,890
A few moments later, Ms.

1202
01:33:10,931 --> 01:33:15,613
Greenbaum received a message from the juveniles that they had been served alcohol.

1203
01:33:16,682 --> 01:33:24,446
Now, they had been instructed to order like a hard seltzer, alcoholic beverage, specifically, truly.

1204
01:33:24,966 --> 01:33:28,007
Now, once they received, Ms.

1205
01:33:28,027 --> 01:33:42,394
Greenbaum received the message, I entered the Hyatt Hotel, and as I approached the main desk slash bar area, I observed the 16-year-old and 17-year-old walking towards me, and they explained the following.

1206
01:33:43,835 --> 01:33:47,898
They explained that they had approached the bar and they had asked for a hot salsa.

1207
01:33:49,319 --> 01:33:53,562
The Hyatt Hotel does not have hot salsas.

1208
01:33:54,523 --> 01:34:01,387
So the bartender said that they had angry orchard hard cider, which is an alcoholic beverage.

1209
01:34:02,428 --> 01:34:05,230
He did not ask them for identification.

1210
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:08,212
He did ask them how old they were.

1211
01:34:09,413 --> 01:34:12,055
They did not initially immediately respond.

1212
01:34:13,554 --> 01:34:21,506
to which the bartender told them, next time don't hesitate when answering, and then stated something along the lines, it doesn't matter anyway.

1213
01:34:22,548 --> 01:34:27,976
He then told them to stop talking about college because his manager was close by.

1214
01:34:29,847 --> 01:34:33,468
and then started having small talk with the 16-year-old and 17-year-old.

1215
01:34:34,708 --> 01:34:38,509
They did not feel comfortable after being served these alcoholic beverages.

1216
01:34:39,649 --> 01:34:48,330
They felt uncomfortable with the bartender, and they got up and did not wait for me to come to the bar.

1217
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:51,291
They got up and just wanted to get out of there.

1218
01:34:51,391 --> 01:34:52,631
They did not feel comfortable at all.

1219
01:34:53,871 --> 01:34:55,932
They identified the male to me by his name tag.

1220
01:34:55,952 --> 01:34:56,992
His name was Jarrell.

1221
01:34:58,092 --> 01:35:08,779
At that time I sat, I had them go back out to the car and I sat down at the bar and a Jarell White Gunter was the bartender.

1222
01:35:09,439 --> 01:35:10,180
He approached me.

1223
01:35:11,921 --> 01:35:13,902
He admitted to not asking them for their IDs.

1224
01:35:15,063 --> 01:35:19,286
I said he's worked at the hotel for nine months and he's received minimal training.

1225
01:35:20,346 --> 01:35:26,210
He was apologetic once he realized that he had served alcohol to a 16 and 17 year old female.

1226
01:35:27,642 --> 01:35:30,583
Um, he then got his manager, Mr Harold Jones.

1227
01:35:31,743 --> 01:35:40,285
Mr Jones once again apologized for what had transpired, and I believe he said it was his third day of working at the hotel.

1228
01:35:43,726 --> 01:35:45,246
So that was the extent of that night.

1229
01:35:46,526 --> 01:35:47,427
Thank you, Officer Smith.

1230
01:35:48,987 --> 01:35:53,048
Um, do we have a representative from Hyatt here to like to speak?

1231
01:35:54,156 --> 01:35:55,196
Good afternoon, everybody.

1232
01:35:56,117 --> 01:36:08,261
First and foremost, my apologies on the gross negligence on the compliance for- Can I just interrupt you for a second and just have you state your name and organization for the record, please?

1233
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:09,402
Yep.

1234
01:36:09,962 --> 01:36:11,502
First name is Harold, last name is Jones.

1235
01:36:11,602 --> 01:36:15,864
I'm the general manager here at the Hyatt Place on 16 Riverside Ave.

1236
01:36:17,675 --> 01:36:18,657
Okay, thank you.

1237
01:36:19,057 --> 01:36:19,498
Absolutely.

1238
01:36:21,301 --> 01:36:26,889
Again, I wanted to kind of lead in with apologies on our negligence on our compliance.

1239
01:36:28,391 --> 01:36:31,997
You know, it's not indicative of our community standing within the neighborhood.

1240
01:36:33,619 --> 01:36:38,603
As an organization, we do require all of our associates to be TIP certified.

1241
01:36:39,443 --> 01:36:42,906
As a management company, we require all of our hotels to be TIP certified.

1242
01:36:44,087 --> 01:36:47,450
Associates are not allowed to serve alcohol unless they're TIP certified.

1243
01:36:49,331 --> 01:36:55,815
And the appropriate protocols with this particular individual had been followed.

1244
01:36:56,475 --> 01:37:10,364
However, given the training, as the officer had indicated that this associate did not have, different protocols in this case were followed because he did not have the full amount of training that this individual had.

1245
01:37:12,056 --> 01:37:17,798
So an audit was then conducted for all of our associates that need to have their TIPS training.

1246
01:37:18,258 --> 01:37:22,339
All of our TIPS tokens were purchased for all of them to complete their TIPS training.

1247
01:37:22,999 --> 01:37:30,441
As mentioned, we are a TIPS compliance property and management company for all of our properties to do that.

1248
01:37:30,521 --> 01:37:32,662
So that is a process for all of our

1249
01:37:34,045 --> 01:37:42,987
individuals that work the gallery here at the property to ensure that all of our front desk team members are TIP certified, so instances like this don't happen.

1250
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:51,610
When the officer told me that Jarrell served a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old alcohol, I almost fell backwards.

1251
01:37:52,170 --> 01:37:56,411
I don't know that I even have words to express except for apologies.

1252
01:37:57,711 --> 01:37:59,772
Again, that's not indicative of

1253
01:38:00,973 --> 01:38:02,515
behaviors here at the property.

1254
01:38:03,317 --> 01:38:07,503
I've been with our company for quite a bit of time, not necessarily this property.

1255
01:38:07,884 --> 01:38:15,395
It was in fact my first couple of days at the property, so that was not necessarily the welcoming that I really would have wanted to have.

1256
01:38:20,583 --> 01:38:21,584
Was he disciplined?

1257
01:38:21,764 --> 01:38:23,625
Jarrell, was he disciplined for it at all?

1258
01:38:24,185 --> 01:38:24,385
Yes.

1259
01:38:24,706 --> 01:38:24,946
Yeah.

1260
01:38:25,026 --> 01:38:30,609
So Jarrell is on his final warning here at the property for anything for that matter.

1261
01:38:31,069 --> 01:38:38,254
Not necessarily just the infraction that occurred for this particular incident, but a final warning for anything that might occur after this.

1262
01:38:39,034 --> 01:38:42,737
You know, wearing the wrong dress shirt to work, shoes, anything.

1263
01:38:43,697 --> 01:38:44,298
OK, thank you.

1264
01:38:44,858 --> 01:38:45,058
Yeah.

1265
01:38:48,020 --> 01:38:48,200
Ellen.

1266
01:38:49,716 --> 01:38:55,861
Yeah, your business is tough because you want to keep your guests very happy.

1267
01:38:55,941 --> 01:39:05,508
But yeah, no, I'm satisfied that you've taken the necessary steps and the individual is aware of what they've done.

1268
01:39:05,648 --> 01:39:07,729
So I don't have anything else to say.

1269
01:39:10,071 --> 01:39:10,131
OK.

1270
01:39:12,403 --> 01:39:25,655
Well, you know, since you say all of your employees are TIP certified, I'm going to ask you to just please submit a current list and copies of the TIP certification to Daria.

1271
01:39:26,155 --> 01:39:26,395
Sure.

1272
01:39:26,576 --> 01:39:36,144
And ones that are not TIP certified, if there are any, if you can make sure that they are TIP certified within the next 90 days, please.

1273
01:39:36,264 --> 01:39:36,925
Okay, sure.

1274
01:39:38,210 --> 01:39:49,417
This is, I'm sure if it's okay with my fellow commissioners, we'll impose the same type of warning on you folks.

1275
01:39:49,758 --> 01:39:51,919
That's fair.

1276
01:39:52,039 --> 01:39:52,979
One bite of the apple.

1277
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:53,840
Yeah.

1278
01:39:54,921 --> 01:39:55,761
One bite of the apple.

1279
01:39:55,901 --> 01:39:56,702
One bite of the apple.

1280
01:39:56,862 --> 01:39:57,002
Yeah.

1281
01:39:58,081 --> 01:39:59,603
You'll be on probation for one year.

1282
01:40:00,144 --> 01:40:08,296
And if you should have another violation and we'll deal with it at that time, but this is like Alan said, you're only wanting.

1283
01:40:08,676 --> 01:40:14,645
So it's if one of my fellow commissioners would care to put that in the form of a motion.

1284
01:40:18,037 --> 01:40:19,058
Yeah, I can do this one.

1285
01:40:19,438 --> 01:40:46,060
So I'll make a motion that we're going to give a warning to the Hyatt and 116 Riverside Ave for one year due to this violation, just a warning, and that we're requesting that all employees who are serving alcohol that are TIP certified and that TIP certification is sent to Daria at Medford.

1286
01:40:46,861 --> 01:40:48,582
Um, within the next 3 months.

1287
01:40:50,782 --> 01:40:51,242
Thank you, Ben.

1288
01:40:51,362 --> 01:40:52,143
Do I hear a 2nd?

1289
01:40:52,503 --> 01:40:53,863
Yeah, I 2nd that motion.

1290
01:40:53,923 --> 01:40:54,463
Thanks, Ben.

1291
01:40:55,584 --> 01:40:56,464
All those in favor.

1292
01:40:57,504 --> 01:40:57,684
Yep.

1293
01:40:58,524 --> 01:40:59,225
All those opposed.

1294
01:41:00,945 --> 01:41:03,046
I have it motions passed.

1295
01:41:04,566 --> 01:41:05,146
Thank you.

1296
01:41:06,887 --> 01:41:07,327
Lieutenant.

1297
01:41:08,147 --> 01:41:08,727
Thank you.

1298
01:41:09,708 --> 01:41:10,428
Moving along.

1299
01:41:11,676 --> 01:41:30,502
About an hour later, Officer Sebastian was out that evening of the 26th with Catherine Dingra and a 16-year-old and 17-year-old male who are known as JV3 and JV4.

1300
01:41:31,823 --> 01:41:34,604
And they went into real gusto at 24 High Street.

1301
01:41:38,843 --> 01:41:50,629
Okay, so on June 26, at approximately 7.40 PM, Juvenile 3 and Juvenile 4 entered Rail Gusto, which is located at 24 High Street.

1302
01:41:50,649 --> 01:41:56,251
Approximately five minutes after Juvenile 3 and Juvenile 4 entered Rail Gusto, Ms.

1303
01:41:56,312 --> 01:42:01,194
Dingro received a text from Juvenile 4 that Juvenile 3 and Juvenile 4 had just been served above light.

1304
01:42:02,202 --> 01:42:05,926
At that time, I exited my unmarked police unit and entered real gusto.

1305
01:42:06,487 --> 01:42:10,831
Juvenile 3 and Juvenile 4 were seated in a table in the far back right corner of the store.

1306
01:42:12,093 --> 01:42:16,918
In front of both Juvenile 3 and Juvenile 4 were an unopened can of Bud Light beer.

1307
01:42:17,868 --> 01:42:21,594
Um, I asked juvenile three and juvenile four to describe the person who served them.

1308
01:42:21,654 --> 01:42:30,527
And they stated a young male with black hair, six feet tall, and then turn around and saw a male matching that description pointed to him and asked juvenile three and juvenile four.

1309
01:42:31,028 --> 01:42:32,990
That was a male and they both stated yes.

1310
01:42:34,288 --> 01:42:40,051
I then informed Juvenile 3 and Juvenile 4 that they could leave the store and go back to the unmarked police vehicle with Ms.

1311
01:42:40,071 --> 01:42:40,551
Stingra.

1312
01:42:41,132 --> 01:42:56,140
I then walked up to the mail and identified myself as a Medford police officer with my Medford police badge clearly displayed and informed them that I was doing an alcohol compliance check throughout the city and that they had just sold alcohol to a 16, 17-year-old juvenile.

1313
01:42:56,780 --> 01:43:01,663
I asked the mail party for his ID, which he identified himself as Nathan McCarthy.

1314
01:43:02,284 --> 01:43:05,494
I asked him if the owner stated no, but he did prov

1315
01:43:10,547 --> 01:43:16,589
The only phone number on the card was the restaurant number, so I was unable to speak with Mr. Ranzio.

1316
01:43:16,609 --> 01:43:23,411
I informed Real Gusto that I've been documenting the incident and to let the owner know.

1317
01:43:24,691 --> 01:43:37,675
It should be noted that I was told later on by Juvenile 3 and Juvenile 4 that Mr. McCarthy did ask them for an ID, and they answered honestly that they did not have one.

1318
01:43:40,081 --> 01:43:44,603
Mr. McCarthy said, well, you look like you're my age, which was 21.

1319
01:43:46,003 --> 01:43:47,384
So he served them anyway.

1320
01:43:51,745 --> 01:43:52,586
Thank you, officer.

1321
01:43:55,166 --> 01:43:58,248
Do we have a representative from Rio Gusto?

1322
01:43:59,748 --> 01:44:04,690
If so, could you kindly state your name and business address for the record, please?

1323
01:44:06,092 --> 01:44:06,392
Okay.

1324
01:44:06,412 --> 01:44:08,033
Hello, this is Matteo Ranzio.

1325
01:44:08,393 --> 01:44:08,914
I'm the owner.

1326
01:44:08,934 --> 01:44:10,434
I live with my wife.

1327
01:44:10,955 --> 01:44:17,318
She's the owner of Rialto 24 High Street Medical.

1328
01:44:19,479 --> 01:44:21,120
So we are truly sorry for what happened.

1329
01:44:21,160 --> 01:44:23,081
I mean, this is the first time we can do.

1330
01:44:23,401 --> 01:44:24,242
We were not there.

1331
01:44:25,022 --> 01:44:26,463
We are running also another business.

1332
01:44:27,083 --> 01:44:30,025
So that night we were not in the business.

1333
01:44:30,986 --> 01:44:35,008
And so we were called by our manager like,

1334
01:44:36,183 --> 01:44:43,128
20 minutes after the officer went out of the restaurant, because we were not able to answer the phone.

1335
01:44:43,168 --> 01:44:43,849
We were working.

1336
01:44:44,809 --> 01:44:51,234
And honestly, I mean, I'm still shocked about it, because it's nine years that we have the business over there.

1337
01:44:51,634 --> 01:44:52,875
We were working every day.

1338
01:44:52,955 --> 01:44:56,277
Now with two businesses, it's really difficult to be there and here.

1339
01:44:57,803 --> 01:45:04,727
And I mean, I don't have, let's say, words to apologize for this situation.

1340
01:45:05,087 --> 01:45:16,152
The only thing I can tell, that night, the server was on training, and he would be being shadowed by the experienced server that usually work with us.

1341
01:45:16,252 --> 01:45:18,654
Unfortunately, she called him sick.

1342
01:45:19,094 --> 01:45:24,357
So that night, we had working just this guy and the manager at the bar.

1343
01:45:25,537 --> 01:45:27,018
So it's not, I mean,

1344
01:45:28,270 --> 01:45:29,091
doesn't mean nothing.

1345
01:45:29,151 --> 01:45:31,972
It's just a situation I would like to explain.

1346
01:45:32,493 --> 01:45:49,563
And usually what we do, starting from the hostess, we don't check the idea of your station, but usually what we ask the hostess, you know, don't bring the wine and beer list, if you are not sure about the age.

1347
01:45:50,003 --> 01:45:55,346
So that night, we made many mistakes, and we are sorry for it.

1348
01:45:56,407 --> 01:45:57,848
And so for sure, we need

1349
01:45:58,999 --> 01:46:01,620
all the people with the TIP certificate and we are going to do that.

1350
01:46:01,640 --> 01:46:10,362
The guy was on training and honestly, for this reason, we didn't hire him.

1351
01:46:12,183 --> 01:46:13,803
In my opinion, a huge mistake.

1352
01:46:13,864 --> 01:46:16,224
Now, I didn't know that he asked for ID.

1353
01:46:16,784 --> 01:46:19,365
This is something that my manager told me.

1354
01:46:20,025 --> 01:46:26,047
But whatever, if they don't have an ID, honestly, I'm a professional bartender.

1355
01:46:26,367 --> 01:46:27,748
I don't serve alcohol.

1356
01:46:29,253 --> 01:46:33,963
I'm not sure about it, so it's totally wrong.

1357
01:46:34,685 --> 01:46:35,507
Now the thing is...

1358
01:46:40,556 --> 01:47:04,154
we are pushing, I mean, before this meeting, we already talked to the manager to have the people, I mean, the staff in the dining room and the bar, I'm not talking about the kitchen, I don't think it's, the kitchen guys need to be tip certificate, but if you need it, we do also for the kitchen guys, but I don't know, I mean, just asking for this thing.

1359
01:47:07,311 --> 01:47:09,112
I think just the people handling the alcohol.

1360
01:47:10,072 --> 01:47:20,314
And if that's, and I think if I may speak, I just think if you're, you know, we understand the sincerity there and that this was an inexperienced server and that, you know, it happened.

1361
01:47:20,454 --> 01:47:34,458
So, you know, as long as the, in my opinion, as long as, you know, the reaction from the ownership is the right, is the way you're saying it is and you're getting everybody certified, I think that's taking the right steps so that this doesn't happen again.

1362
01:47:35,805 --> 01:47:36,385
Yeah, for sure.

1363
01:47:36,505 --> 01:47:43,170
I mean, we do our best to make some procedures that make us, let's say, on the safe situation.

1364
01:47:43,190 --> 01:47:53,656
Now we are printing a new, also just to let you know, a new wine and beer and legal manual in order to avoid to give everything together.

1365
01:47:53,696 --> 01:48:02,682
I mean, I know that is not, let's say, the best solution, but I want all the process, starting from your station to

1366
01:48:04,024 --> 01:48:08,666
Seating the people has to be checked from all the people involved.

1367
01:48:08,766 --> 01:48:15,530
So the server, the manager, because if we don't do this, there is always a risk of mistakes.

1368
01:48:16,470 --> 01:48:17,931
And in nine years, we didn't do that.

1369
01:48:17,971 --> 01:48:25,734
So now I'm afraid because these mistakes, I don't accept this kind of thing.

1370
01:48:25,754 --> 01:48:29,036
So I'm trying to be tough on this.

1371
01:48:33,068 --> 01:48:37,784
Okay, Ellen, would you like?

1372
01:48:37,804 --> 01:48:39,610
Yeah, I know.

1373
01:48:41,218 --> 01:48:46,881
Mateo and Francesca, have you guys been with us, what, 10 years now?

1374
01:48:46,921 --> 01:48:49,042
Nine years, yeah.

1375
01:48:49,502 --> 01:48:59,846
You've had a clean record and I appreciate what you're telling us and you will take the necessary steps that this doesn't happen again.

1376
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:04,068
Mr. Chairman, I don't have anything else.

1377
01:49:06,213 --> 01:49:06,693
Okay, great.

1378
01:49:08,995 --> 01:49:11,196
Mateo and Francesca presented very well.

1379
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:20,002
And like you say, Mr. Commissioner Allen and Ben, I think they kind of get the picture here.

1380
01:49:20,122 --> 01:49:27,687
So my recommendation is to also give Mateo and Francesca one bite of the apple, they can share that bite.

1381
01:49:28,731 --> 01:49:46,421
And they need to get everybody that's handling the alcohol TIP certified, same as the others, within 90 days, please have copies of the TIP certification forwarded to Daria, and we'll go from there.

1382
01:49:46,781 --> 01:49:54,505
And you know, Mateo, you got the right idea, no license, no alcohol,

1383
01:49:55,688 --> 01:50:00,590
Obviously, if someone comes in that looks as old as I do, it's okay.

1384
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:10,833
I mean, you know, what I understand is, you know, sometimes I'm 50 years old, if I shave my beard, sometimes they ask me the idea, I'm fine.

1385
01:50:10,893 --> 01:50:18,395
I mean, for me, it's good, because it's still, you know, better safe than sorry.

1386
01:50:18,455 --> 01:50:19,075
That's the thing.

1387
01:50:21,335 --> 01:50:22,236
Yeah, we understand.

1388
01:50:22,317 --> 01:50:25,441
We understand where you are and it should have never happened.

1389
01:50:25,501 --> 01:50:26,623
And yeah, that's a good thing.

1390
01:50:27,044 --> 01:50:28,225
So we all learned from this.

1391
01:50:28,967 --> 01:50:29,207
Yeah.

1392
01:50:29,427 --> 01:50:29,587
Okay.

1393
01:50:30,397 --> 01:50:32,758
One of the commissioners want to make a motion, please.

1394
01:50:33,098 --> 01:50:34,259
I'll do it.

1395
01:50:35,059 --> 01:50:42,722
I motion that we put Gusto on probation for a year as long as there's no infractions.

1396
01:50:43,582 --> 01:50:52,006
We don't have to dig out the penalty section of the city ordinances and also make sure all

1397
01:50:53,086 --> 01:51:01,429
individuals who serve alcohol, whether at the tables or behind the bar counter, of course, be CHIP certified within 90 days.

1398
01:51:03,090 --> 01:51:03,490
Very good.

1399
01:51:03,890 --> 01:51:04,530
I second that.

1400
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:06,291
All right.

1401
01:51:06,391 --> 01:51:06,831
Very good.

1402
01:51:08,172 --> 01:51:08,852
All those in favor?

1403
01:51:09,712 --> 01:51:09,812
Aye.

1404
01:51:11,333 --> 01:51:12,073
All those opposed?

1405
01:51:13,574 --> 01:51:15,514
Hearing and seeing none, the ayes have it.

1406
01:51:15,534 --> 01:51:17,175
The motion has been passed.

1407
01:51:19,358 --> 01:51:20,158
Thank you very much.

1408
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:26,800
Lieutenant.

1409
01:51:27,841 --> 01:51:38,064
Last but not least, we have Officer Smith and Deep Cuts 21 Main Street.

1410
01:51:41,085 --> 01:51:41,705
Hello, everyone.

1411
01:51:42,405 --> 01:51:43,085
Officer Smith again.

1412
01:51:46,233 --> 01:51:49,757
June 26th, with the assistance of Ms.

1413
01:51:49,777 --> 01:52:00,048
Greenbaum and the 16-year-old and 17-year-old juvenile females, we conducted a compliance check at Deep Cuts, 21 Main Street.

1414
01:52:00,809 --> 01:52:06,895
The two juveniles were instructed to enter the premise and order a Truly Hot Salsa.

1415
01:52:08,417 --> 01:52:13,681
They went into deep cuts and a few moments later they notified Ms.

1416
01:52:13,701 --> 01:52:22,329
Greenbaum that they had been served an alcoholic beverage, at which time I entered the establishment and located the juveniles sitting at the bar.

1417
01:52:23,410 --> 01:52:28,074
In front of them were two glass bottles that read Topo Chico.

1418
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:42,094
I'm not familiar with Topo Chico, and I asked them what they had ordered, and they said that they did not have the truly hard seltzers, and that that's what was recommended to them as a comparison.

1419
01:52:43,635 --> 01:52:48,661
They used $30 in marked bills to pay for these beverages, and were given $2 and change.

1420
01:52:50,082 --> 01:52:57,768
So I looked up at the board to see what they had ordered, and they had ordered a beverage called Dude Ranch Water.

1421
01:52:58,569 --> 01:53:04,393
Each one of them is sold for $14, and it consists of Topo Chico, tequila, and lime.

1422
01:53:05,394 --> 01:53:09,077
I asked them who had served them, and they pointed to a female bartender.

1423
01:53:10,017 --> 01:53:11,920
I thanked them and they went back out to the car.

1424
01:53:13,081 --> 01:53:21,352
The female bartender approached me, identified myself, and she was subsequently identified as Miss Brittany Falgione.

1425
01:53:22,653 --> 01:53:26,598
I explained to her that she had served two juveniles and she was very apologetic.

1426
01:53:27,539 --> 01:53:33,042
She had believed that they had been codded at the door that night, and that's why she served them.

1427
01:53:33,963 --> 01:53:35,624
I then met with Ms.

1428
01:53:35,644 --> 01:53:38,145
Falgione and the manager, Mr. Ian McGregor.

1429
01:53:38,165 --> 01:53:40,106
I explained to him what had transpired.

1430
01:53:40,707 --> 01:53:42,228
He also was very apologetic.

1431
01:53:42,808 --> 01:53:47,951
He explains to me that the typical process for deep cuts is when they have a show, everybody is codded at the door.

1432
01:53:48,925 --> 01:53:52,046
They had a show scheduled for that evening, but it had not yet started.

1433
01:53:52,066 --> 01:53:58,489
He said, when they don't have shows, then it's on the bartenders and the servers to check IDs.

1434
01:53:59,610 --> 01:54:00,770
Both were very apologetic.

1435
01:54:02,811 --> 01:54:04,512
And that was the summary of that one.

1436
01:54:06,693 --> 01:54:06,913
Great.

1437
01:54:07,653 --> 01:54:08,674
Thank you, Officer Schmidt.

1438
01:54:10,906 --> 01:54:15,808
And we have a representative from the Deep Cuts.

1439
01:54:15,868 --> 01:54:18,989
Jeff, could you state your name and business name for the record, please?

1440
01:54:19,569 --> 01:54:23,210
Hi, this is Ian McGregor, co-owner of Deep Cuts.

1441
01:54:26,952 --> 01:54:28,772
I'm very sorry this has happened.

1442
01:54:29,092 --> 01:54:30,853
All of our bartenders should know better.

1443
01:54:33,414 --> 01:54:36,695
We've also had them all renew or get TIP certified.

1444
01:54:38,294 --> 01:54:45,040
Um, and also what Smith said, we typically have events and the door person is supposed to ID.

1445
01:54:45,580 --> 01:54:49,844
We have shows that are 18 and up and you get different color wristbands.

1446
01:54:51,005 --> 01:54:54,928
And if there is not a show, obviously then it's all up to the bartenders.

1447
01:54:55,689 --> 01:54:59,472
And we had a talk with all the bartenders, especially Brittany.

1448
01:55:00,573 --> 01:55:04,376
And they all understand what they, especially her, what she did wrong.

1449
01:55:04,396 --> 01:55:06,437
I'm very sorry about this.

1450
01:55:07,383 --> 01:55:11,945
It's not something that we want happening in our city or our business.

1451
01:55:15,706 --> 01:55:20,568
But you take it there.

1452
01:55:20,808 --> 01:55:24,809
Yeah, I appreciate that Mr. Wetzel.

1453
01:55:25,009 --> 01:55:26,230
I'm a little confused by

1454
01:55:29,343 --> 01:55:30,845
about the carding at the door.

1455
01:55:31,966 --> 01:55:33,007
Do I understand this?

1456
01:55:33,767 --> 01:55:48,002
On the evenings that there is an event or a band, you card at the door and if there's no event or show, it's up to the service of the bartender to card?

1457
01:55:48,342 --> 01:55:49,263
Is that what you're saying?

1458
01:55:49,303 --> 01:55:49,403
Yes.

1459
01:55:49,423 --> 01:55:50,204
We have ticketed events.

1460
01:55:53,882 --> 01:56:00,867
Um, so, uh, basically if you're coming into the show and if you don't have a ticket, you're gonna, the door person can, you can purchase a ticket through the door person.

1461
01:56:01,667 --> 01:56:04,709
Um, and then they, you have to be 18 or older to go to this event.

1462
01:56:05,730 --> 01:56:13,695
So then we give different color wristbands for each and everybody is informed what color wristband is 21 and up and which one is 18.

1463
01:56:15,257 --> 01:56:21,961
Um, so if there's no event at all, we're just open normal, like restaurant hours, then it's just a bartender.

1464
01:56:22,181 --> 01:56:23,022
There's no door person.

1465
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:29,803
OK, so there was no door person, no gatekeeper, so to speak.

1466
01:56:29,843 --> 01:56:35,507
And then there were no ribbons or ties.

1467
01:56:36,447 --> 01:56:41,510
And yet no one still, it's almost like your system just fell in the face.

1468
01:56:45,916 --> 01:56:46,236
Okay.

1469
01:56:46,796 --> 01:56:47,877
I think I understand.

1470
01:56:47,897 --> 01:56:51,238
I just, I'm wondering what, what else has to be done.

1471
01:56:51,898 --> 01:57:01,182
You know, I mean, you have safeguards built in, but it seems like I, it seems like they all failed from this incident.

1472
01:57:01,602 --> 01:57:01,842
Yeah.

1473
01:57:02,802 --> 01:57:03,042
Yeah.

1474
01:57:03,062 --> 01:57:13,786
And we, like we said, we've made sure to talk to everybody, but no matter what, even if it's a show with wristbands, if they're not wearing one, they need to check their ID no matter what look or not.

1475
01:57:14,407 --> 01:57:14,667
Yeah.

1476
01:57:15,067 --> 01:57:15,227
Yeah.

1477
01:57:17,803 --> 01:57:20,368
Well, and you guys are the new kids on the block.

1478
01:57:20,388 --> 01:57:21,871
What about two years, three years?

1479
01:57:22,092 --> 01:57:22,753
How long have you been?

1480
01:57:23,194 --> 01:57:26,902
We were in West Hufford for one, two years, and then this space for a year.

1481
01:57:27,303 --> 01:57:29,227
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1482
01:57:32,099 --> 01:57:35,400
Ben, any- Yeah, I think, I mean, I hear what you're saying.

1483
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:38,381
I think their safeguards, you know, just didn't hold up now.

1484
01:57:38,802 --> 01:57:40,922
But I mean, I can imagine people are coming in.

1485
01:57:41,002 --> 01:57:42,963
She thinks somebody's got a wristband on and they don't.

1486
01:57:43,403 --> 01:57:44,463
It's a mistake.

1487
01:57:44,664 --> 01:57:45,544
It's a bad mistake.

1488
01:57:45,624 --> 01:57:49,225
Good thing it wasn't just a, you know, a compliance check.

1489
01:57:49,245 --> 01:57:51,526
It wasn't really real underage.

1490
01:57:51,586 --> 01:57:53,787
So I think they understand.

1491
01:57:55,267 --> 01:58:04,236
And, you know, and if we were to give them the same, you know, same thing as what the other violators have done, I think that would go a long way with these guys.

1492
01:58:04,456 --> 01:58:07,459
I know that they did not want it happening in their business, so.

1493
01:58:07,479 --> 01:58:13,705
Okay, that's my thought.

1494
01:58:15,427 --> 01:58:15,687
Yeah.

1495
01:58:17,049 --> 01:58:19,151
Mr. Chairman, what are your thoughts?

1496
01:58:21,275 --> 01:58:29,239
You know, after hearing Mr. McGregor, it seems to me like it was just a mistake that was overlooked.

1497
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:40,905
And it sounds like since then, they've changed the policy that the bartenders must see a wristband if there's entertainment that night, whether it's started or not.

1498
01:58:42,135 --> 01:58:44,957
And if there's no wristband, then they have to check an ID.

1499
01:58:45,677 --> 01:58:46,238
Pretty simple.

1500
01:58:47,198 --> 01:58:51,081
So from this point forward, let's hope we don't have this mistake again.

1501
01:58:52,702 --> 01:58:58,726
What we'd like to do, what I'd recommend my fellow commissioners is to put it in the form of a motion.

1502
01:58:59,819 --> 01:59:10,044
that all the employees handling alcohol over at the Deep Cuts be TIP certified, sending Daria a copy of the certifications.

1503
01:59:11,004 --> 01:59:21,769
And you'll also be on, it'll be a one bite of the apple, as everybody says, and you'll be, it's a warning, you're gonna be on a probation for one year.

1504
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:24,931
And let's hope it doesn't happen again.

1505
01:59:31,402 --> 01:59:43,434
I just wanted to say to Mr. McGregor, I'm aware many nightclubs utilize a wristband or a bracelet, and it is convenient.

1506
01:59:45,196 --> 01:59:47,718
I just think it should be stressed upon the bartending staff.

1507
01:59:48,649 --> 02:00:03,759
that even if somebody has a bracelet, if they look like they're 16, 17 years old, they got a bracelet on, it's still on them to say, hey, hey, sir, ma'am, I know you got a bracelet on, but I can't believe you're 21.

1508
02:00:03,919 --> 02:00:04,479
You look so young.

1509
02:00:04,579 --> 02:00:05,540
I got to see your ID.

1510
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:09,542
It's always going to fall on the person that serves that alcohol.

1511
02:00:10,363 --> 02:00:12,004
So, you know, it's great for

1512
02:00:14,045 --> 02:00:18,067
Chairperson made a joke about if you see us coming in there, I got a bracelet on.

1513
02:00:18,828 --> 02:00:19,328
No problem.

1514
02:00:19,368 --> 02:00:20,368
Everything's quick and easy.

1515
02:00:20,949 --> 02:00:28,473
But for those couple people, like I would have hoped that the 16 and 17 year olds that came in, one of them could have passed for 50.

1516
02:00:29,814 --> 02:00:33,436
If they came in and they had a bracelet, I hope they're getting carded.

1517
02:00:34,096 --> 02:00:34,496
You know what I mean?

1518
02:00:34,516 --> 02:00:35,797
Totally.

1519
02:00:35,877 --> 02:00:39,299
I had a chance to see them, but I totally understand.

1520
02:00:39,319 --> 02:00:41,340
And should not.

1521
02:00:43,165 --> 02:00:44,326
Absolutely.

1522
02:00:44,366 --> 02:00:47,787
Brittany still wish she put on, you heard Hyatt.

1523
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:48,848
Hyatt's pretty tough.

1524
02:00:48,908 --> 02:00:52,029
They put their employee on final warning.

1525
02:00:52,449 --> 02:00:57,452
Has any discipline action given to Brittany as a result of this?

1526
02:00:58,272 --> 02:01:04,355
Yes, so we had to sit down with her and basically add a warning to her.

1527
02:01:05,476 --> 02:01:07,296
Basically, kind of like most restaurants,

1528
02:01:08,589 --> 02:01:14,611
Depending how places you work at get like three kind of warnings, you have to write them down, log them.

1529
02:01:14,631 --> 02:01:23,634
Then we kind of did that with her and made sure she was TIP certified and anybody else that wasn't to renew theirs or get one.

1530
02:01:26,575 --> 02:01:26,995
Very good.

1531
02:01:27,195 --> 02:01:27,496
Thank you.

1532
02:01:30,150 --> 02:01:36,693
That was a good point, Lieutenant Lockwood, and it didn't even dawn on me, and yeah, it's just common sense.

1533
02:01:36,773 --> 02:01:43,416
If the person doesn't meet their age, don't be afraid to ask for the ID, even though they got the bracelet on.

1534
02:01:44,717 --> 02:01:50,199
Okay, if there's nothing else, one of you gentlemen would like to make that in the form of a motion?

1535
02:01:51,680 --> 02:01:51,980
I can.

1536
02:01:53,868 --> 02:02:13,478
So I'll make a motion to give Deep Cuts the one-year warning based on its violation, and that they will send all of the TIP certifications that their employees have over to Daria at Medford City Hall.

1537
02:02:15,179 --> 02:02:19,141
So that we have those on file, and they'll send that to us within the next three months.

1538
02:02:21,064 --> 02:02:21,904
Very good, Ben.

1539
02:02:22,004 --> 02:02:23,425
I second the motion.

1540
02:02:24,665 --> 02:02:26,845
Okay, all those in favor, aye.

1541
02:02:27,786 --> 02:02:27,906
Aye.

1542
02:02:28,806 --> 02:02:29,566
All those opposed?

1543
02:02:31,087 --> 02:02:33,487
Hearing and seeing none, motion carries.

1544
02:02:33,907 --> 02:02:34,267
Thank you.

1545
02:02:35,448 --> 02:02:35,928
Thank you.

1546
02:02:36,408 --> 02:02:37,028
Thank you, Ian.

1547
02:02:37,708 --> 02:02:44,250
Appreciate you coming and I'm sure things will be moving forward in a better direction from this point on.

1548
02:02:46,290 --> 02:02:46,671
Take care.

1549
02:02:47,571 --> 02:02:48,211
Okay, you too.

1550
02:02:51,705 --> 02:02:56,748
Okay, well, been a little extended.

1551
02:02:56,788 --> 02:02:58,809
We're gonna have to put everybody in for overtime.

1552
02:02:59,009 --> 02:03:03,972
Although I think the police gotta go at another half hour to an hour before overtime kicks in.

1553
02:03:03,992 --> 02:03:04,713
I'm not sure.

1554
02:03:05,193 --> 02:03:07,414
Oh no, we're on overtime the second we show up.

1555
02:03:11,216 --> 02:03:14,078
If you're not working.

1556
02:03:14,178 --> 02:03:15,779
Officer Sebastian's on shift.

1557
02:03:16,579 --> 02:03:20,021
I don't know if Daria, you can hear me or not.

1558
02:03:22,371 --> 02:03:24,432
Well, maybe I should probably say Daria, can you hear me?

1559
02:03:24,452 --> 02:03:26,273
I'm here, I can hear you.

1560
02:03:26,393 --> 02:03:26,793
Okay.

1561
02:03:27,813 --> 02:03:31,815
I know this is the first time we've done the sort of summonsing process in a while.

1562
02:03:32,615 --> 02:03:33,595
Yep.

1563
02:03:33,955 --> 02:03:45,720
So the chief reached out to me yesterday and basically said, you can just send me an email saying you want Officer Sebastian or Smith or myself and we'll make that happen.

1564
02:03:45,740 --> 02:03:50,502
We really no reason to bother him to request our presence.

1565
02:03:52,817 --> 02:03:55,061
So that'll make things streamline.

1566
02:03:55,723 --> 02:03:58,007
One less email the chief has to read every month.

1567
02:03:58,648 --> 02:04:01,393
Well, he wasn't here, so I was like, chief, just to ask you.

1568
02:04:01,413 --> 02:04:01,494
Yeah.

1569
02:04:02,135 --> 02:04:03,878
There you go.

1570
02:04:04,939 --> 02:04:06,120
cornered them in the office.

1571
02:04:06,420 --> 02:04:06,641
Yeah.

1572
02:04:07,681 --> 02:04:10,644
Catherine and Sophie, I'd like to thank both of you for attending.

1573
02:04:11,525 --> 02:04:12,926
You guys did a great job.

1574
02:04:14,127 --> 02:04:20,733
You know, it's it's working with off of Lieutenant Lockowitz is, it's not an easy task.

1575
02:04:21,353 --> 02:04:23,756
But, you know, you guys did great.

1576
02:04:24,496 --> 02:04:25,237
Sorry.

1577
02:04:26,918 --> 02:04:30,542
Yeah, and I just wanted to thank you for attending and doing such a good job with this.

1578
02:04:31,162 --> 02:04:31,943
I think we're a good team.

1579
02:04:33,280 --> 02:04:33,540
Yes.

1580
02:04:33,580 --> 02:04:34,841
And thank you so much for your time.

1581
02:04:34,881 --> 02:04:35,921
We really appreciate it.

1582
02:04:37,622 --> 02:04:38,122
My pleasure.

1583
02:04:38,823 --> 02:04:39,363
Very good.

1584
02:04:39,543 --> 02:04:40,023
Thank you.

1585
02:04:41,924 --> 02:04:42,244
Alrighty.

1586
02:04:42,724 --> 02:04:46,786
Um, so that kind of ends this portion of the meeting.

1587
02:04:47,347 --> 02:04:54,450
Um, anything you think we should have done different, uh, Rory or Catherine or Sophie, uh,

1588
02:04:55,369 --> 02:04:56,650
Did we handle it properly?

1589
02:04:56,750 --> 02:05:05,312
I mean, I'm kind of new in the chair and this is my first time even sitting in a violation type of a, you know, compliance violation.

1590
02:05:05,392 --> 02:05:11,314
So I'm not sure whether we were on target, whether we're just, any comments, good, bad?

1591
02:05:11,334 --> 02:05:13,934
I think everything went fine.

1592
02:05:16,395 --> 02:05:22,437
We ran a little long, but everybody, you know, everybody should be afforded the right to

1593
02:05:23,907 --> 02:05:28,031
hear the report and be given the opportunity to respond.

1594
02:05:28,151 --> 02:05:29,732
So there's really no way.

1595
02:05:29,752 --> 02:05:34,236
I don't see anything we could have done that would have cut more than a minute or two out of this.

1596
02:05:34,856 --> 02:05:35,076
Yeah.

1597
02:05:35,557 --> 02:05:41,662
And speaking of responding, do you think that what we're setting for Blue Fuji is appropriate?

1598
02:05:41,702 --> 02:05:44,624
Or do you think we should act on something like that now?

1599
02:05:46,538 --> 02:06:00,774
You know, I mean, light a fire under them, something like, we're going to suspend your license, blah, blah, blah, unless you get back to us immediately, fail to attend the required meeting.

1600
02:06:00,854 --> 02:06:03,116
I mean, I don't really see.

1601
02:06:04,553 --> 02:06:18,660
I don't know if I'm looking at it too deep or not, but I can't say that I don't see it's anything of that nature that we have to suspend their license, but it is because they serve the miners.

1602
02:06:19,060 --> 02:06:22,922
So what's the stopping from serving miners between now and September?

1603
02:06:23,703 --> 02:06:25,824
Yeah, I agree with you.

1604
02:06:26,124 --> 02:06:33,748
I would, in my world of, in my thought process, I would wanna make sure

1605
02:06:34,628 --> 02:06:43,674
that they did in fact receive that letter before I went and took an action such as suspending a license.

1606
02:06:44,834 --> 02:06:48,336
I think the next letter should say, you did not show up to the hearing.

1607
02:06:48,516 --> 02:06:50,698
You will be suspended if you're not at the next one.

1608
02:06:53,346 --> 02:06:55,647
But yeah, I would want to know why they weren't there.

1609
02:06:56,408 --> 02:07:01,251
If they got the letter and just crumpled it up and threw it in the trash can, that would be egregious.

1610
02:07:01,291 --> 02:07:08,515
But knowing that they've been in this city for 15 years, I would be surprised if they just ignored the summons.

1611
02:07:09,508 --> 02:07:10,929
Well, plus they were emailed.

1612
02:07:10,969 --> 02:07:12,169
So like I did it two ways.

1613
02:07:12,249 --> 02:07:14,190
I emailed that day and I send the letter.

1614
02:07:14,250 --> 02:07:18,991
So like you could blame the letter coming in late, but an email, it comes right away.

1615
02:07:19,072 --> 02:07:19,612
You know what I mean?

1616
02:07:19,672 --> 02:07:21,913
So maybe that person is out.

1617
02:07:21,973 --> 02:07:22,313
I don't know.

1618
02:07:22,373 --> 02:07:23,693
It's not just specific person.

1619
02:07:23,713 --> 02:07:25,034
I think it's just their email.

1620
02:07:26,254 --> 02:07:48,923
um the blue foot gmail so i don't know did you they were they were four one uh daria put it in bold red letters right at the bottom failure to attend the hearing could face indefinite license suspension until the matter is resolved and that came right from ralph sacramony at the abcc so um technically

1621
02:07:49,995 --> 02:07:53,658
But now, Ralph, their license is suspended as of right now.

1622
02:07:54,558 --> 02:07:58,942
It could be if we decided that, but I don't, I think that's going to be a little overboard.

1623
02:07:59,522 --> 02:08:06,847
I think we just got to kind of look at this, maybe suggestions from all you folks, Ben, Al, and Rory.

1624
02:08:08,889 --> 02:08:11,190
We can hand deliver that next message.

1625
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:14,553
With the hand deliver what?

1626
02:08:15,917 --> 02:08:16,657
The next letter.

1627
02:08:17,317 --> 02:08:17,918
The next letter.

1628
02:08:18,138 --> 02:08:26,020
I mean, you send it to myself or Officer Smith will print it out and walk it in, get the name of the person we handed it to.

1629
02:08:26,040 --> 02:08:27,840
Okay.

1630
02:08:28,020 --> 02:08:29,481
I think that'd be a good start.

1631
02:08:29,981 --> 02:08:35,802
Yeah.

1632
02:08:35,902 --> 02:08:38,643
I like Officer Lockowitz's idea.

1633
02:08:40,163 --> 02:08:41,584
I just think it's incumbent upon us,

1634
02:08:43,050 --> 02:08:45,952
to have a big memory, you know what I mean?

1635
02:08:45,992 --> 02:08:51,836
Because these six, you know, what we should be doing is make sure we have a file on these six.

1636
02:08:51,876 --> 02:08:56,639
Hey, you know, they were caught up in this control compliance check this time.

1637
02:08:57,320 --> 02:09:03,204
And, you know, is our goal still to try this every six months or every 12 months?

1638
02:09:04,825 --> 02:09:12,110
Do we know what the schedule is for control compliance checks or is it once a year?

1639
02:09:14,039 --> 02:09:15,006
Turn that over to Sophie.

1640
02:09:15,932 --> 02:09:16,335
Sophie.

1641
02:09:19,511 --> 02:09:20,351
Oh, the pressure is on.

1642
02:09:20,511 --> 02:09:22,072
What is what's happening now?

1643
02:09:22,412 --> 02:09:30,054
OK, but no, so we can do this every six months or every year we would like.

1644
02:09:30,814 --> 02:09:34,695
This is one of our initiatives through the grant that I coordinate.

1645
02:09:34,775 --> 02:09:42,516
That's called Mass Call 3B and one of the initiatives is to make sure that we do have consistent compliance checks across our region.

1646
02:09:42,897 --> 02:09:49,098
So we're happy to support that from a grant perspective on whatever you feel like is the most appropriate for Medford.

1647
02:09:49,898 --> 02:09:50,979
Okay.

1648
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:58,284
Through the chair, I would like to see this done again in six months and see if these six entities learned anything.

1649
02:10:00,065 --> 02:10:06,949
I'm sorry, just keep in mind that this is a public meeting, so you might not want to tell them exactly when it's going to happen again.

1650
02:10:06,969 --> 02:10:07,009
No.

1651
02:10:08,630 --> 02:10:09,431
I see what you're saying.

1652
02:10:09,591 --> 02:10:09,851
Yeah.

1653
02:10:09,991 --> 02:10:10,271
Okay.

1654
02:10:10,311 --> 02:10:11,012
Well, we'll leave that.

1655
02:10:12,188 --> 02:10:15,252
up to the control.

1656
02:10:15,352 --> 02:10:16,273
Yeah.

1657
02:10:16,333 --> 02:10:19,095
Yeah.

1658
02:10:19,195 --> 02:10:26,683
It's not a big secret that we do compliance checks matter of fact, even before this round, we we publicize that we will be doing it.

1659
02:10:27,083 --> 02:10:28,284
Yeah, that's true.

1660
02:10:28,324 --> 02:10:32,285
We've done them for years, and these are all experienced.

1661
02:10:32,305 --> 02:10:33,826
They know Don well.

1662
02:10:33,966 --> 02:10:39,628
Even if they have establishments in other communities, they're well aware of controlled compliance checks.

1663
02:10:42,009 --> 02:10:44,650
Like I said, we have to keep track of these six.

1664
02:10:45,291 --> 02:10:51,453
Whenever the next round is, I'll be curious to see if we have a clean slate.

1665
02:10:51,553 --> 02:10:53,594
We do have the entire city, correct?

1666
02:10:53,994 --> 02:10:54,775
The entire city.

1667
02:10:56,123 --> 02:11:02,066
You know, and I was saying earlier, you know, I remember we'd only we'd only snag maybe two, three at the most.

1668
02:11:02,186 --> 02:11:06,769
And we used to pat ourselves on the back saying out of all the license holders, this is damn good.

1669
02:11:06,829 --> 02:11:08,530
But six is a lot.

1670
02:11:08,650 --> 02:11:13,853
So when we first got started, I'm sorry to cut you off there.

1671
02:11:14,333 --> 02:11:39,441
No, no, I'm just saying that I'm sure we'll remember what we've done, because I think when we look at the scale, the penalties, first infraction, second infraction, I don't think they'd like, if we bag some of them again within a short period of time, I don't think they're going to like the fact that we could exercise the second tier of the infraction schedule.

1672
02:11:42,678 --> 02:11:51,144
When we first started doing these, seven, eight, and nine, you know, it could be, it doesn't have to be six months, it could be a little longer.

1673
02:11:51,244 --> 02:11:51,764
No, no, whenever.

1674
02:11:51,784 --> 02:11:53,225
I take it back.

1675
02:11:55,290 --> 02:11:55,750
Okay, I'm sorry.

1676
02:11:55,770 --> 02:11:57,051
Go ahead, Luke.

1677
02:11:57,191 --> 02:12:09,255
I would definitely, I would, in my opinion, definitely do the next round sometime at the end of September, October, definitely before there's a chance of snow and extreme cold.

1678
02:12:11,116 --> 02:12:13,577
There's nothing wrong with doing them back-to-back.

1679
02:12:14,517 --> 02:12:18,279
We've done them week after week in the past when we needed to get them done.

1680
02:12:21,420 --> 02:12:24,121
If you go a couple years without doing it,

1681
02:12:24,942 --> 02:12:26,844
the numbers will go up, right?

1682
02:12:26,884 --> 02:12:32,450
The management will change, the bartenders will change, attention to detail.

1683
02:12:34,953 --> 02:12:44,783
When we first started doing this with Penny 14 years ago, I think the most we had was 11 violators in the same day.

1684
02:12:47,190 --> 02:12:49,452
Oh yeah, it was wild.

1685
02:12:50,093 --> 02:12:54,378
And then we kept doing checks, and then those numbers plummeted.

1686
02:12:55,158 --> 02:12:58,362
And then we got down to zero or one, check after check after check.

1687
02:12:59,483 --> 02:13:02,887
And then you stop doing it for a while, and this is what happens.

1688
02:13:04,066 --> 02:13:14,295
The other thing I wanted to point out is that we are gonna send out something to everyone that did pass to kind of remind them that they did a good job and to keep up the good work.

1689
02:13:14,435 --> 02:13:19,719
So we wanna reward those that did do what they were supposed to do.

1690
02:13:20,540 --> 02:13:21,040
Great idea.

1691
02:13:21,681 --> 02:13:22,702
Yeah, very good.

1692
02:13:22,882 --> 02:13:23,543
That's a good point.

1693
02:13:23,583 --> 02:13:30,609
I was just about to ask that, were there a lot of other compliances that did pass on the same round?

1694
02:13:31,578 --> 02:13:32,579
Yeah, everyone that's not here.

1695
02:13:33,079 --> 02:13:33,339
Yeah.

1696
02:13:35,041 --> 02:13:36,261
All of all of the lights.

1697
02:13:36,282 --> 02:13:37,362
So the whole rest of the city.

1698
02:13:38,203 --> 02:13:38,543
Yes.

1699
02:13:38,703 --> 02:13:39,224
Yes, sir.

1700
02:13:39,524 --> 02:13:40,905
But the follow up.

1701
02:13:41,005 --> 02:13:42,346
I didn't realize that.

1702
02:13:42,546 --> 02:13:42,746
Okay.

1703
02:13:42,766 --> 02:13:46,929
But the follow up and Ben's question, do they know that they would just checked?

1704
02:13:47,069 --> 02:13:49,892
Do they know they would just tested the ones that did pass?

1705
02:13:50,715 --> 02:13:57,240
Maybe a couple of them, you know, figured it out because of the nature of somebody came in and then, oh, I don't have ID.

1706
02:13:57,320 --> 02:13:58,120
And then they ran away.

1707
02:13:58,140 --> 02:14:04,425
And the little light bulb goes off and says, yeah, they said, maybe we just, you know, yeah, every now and then the store owner will follow them out.

1708
02:14:05,396 --> 02:14:06,696
and see them getting in the police car.

1709
02:14:06,736 --> 02:14:10,337
I remember waving to a number of people like, yep, it's a compliance check.

1710
02:14:10,857 --> 02:14:12,738
But to Ms.

1711
02:14:12,818 --> 02:14:19,080
Zimmer's point, I think it's a great idea because A, you send them that piece of paper that says, hey, you did a great job.

1712
02:14:19,800 --> 02:14:23,521
And B, it lets them know and reminds them we're out here checking.

1713
02:14:23,981 --> 02:14:24,181
Yeah.

1714
02:14:24,741 --> 02:14:25,581
And we did check.

1715
02:14:26,261 --> 02:14:28,642
And if they didn't know it, now they know.

1716
02:14:28,662 --> 02:14:29,302
Yeah.

1717
02:14:29,462 --> 02:14:30,382
We sent somebody in there.

1718
02:14:30,843 --> 02:14:31,843
Yeah, it's a smart idea.

1719
02:14:32,163 --> 02:14:32,263
Yeah.

1720
02:14:34,478 --> 02:14:35,199
So I love it.

1721
02:14:36,700 --> 02:14:37,100
Great job.

1722
02:14:38,521 --> 02:14:39,382
Well, thank you very much.

1723
02:14:39,562 --> 02:14:40,963
Thank you, all of you.

1724
02:14:41,703 --> 02:14:44,165
We've got just, I think, one more thing on the agenda.

1725
02:14:44,185 --> 02:14:45,766
You guys can take off if you want.

1726
02:14:46,026 --> 02:14:56,674
It's just a matter of us talking about one of our applications that we're reviewing and redesigning, but you're free to go.

1727
02:14:57,034 --> 02:14:57,394
Very good.

1728
02:14:57,434 --> 02:14:58,235
I will take off.

1729
02:14:59,195 --> 02:14:59,856
Thank you all so much.

1730
02:14:59,876 --> 02:15:01,277
Good job, everybody.

1731
02:15:01,297 --> 02:15:01,757
Thank you.

1732
02:15:02,098 --> 02:15:02,618
Thank you again.

1733
02:15:06,034 --> 02:15:15,436
Okay, Daria, you sent us the updated version, right, of that one-day license with the entertainment line in it?

1734
02:15:16,216 --> 02:15:16,436
Yes.

1735
02:15:17,437 --> 02:15:17,777
Okay.

1736
02:15:18,357 --> 02:15:22,598
Yeah, that looked great to me, and that one could be filled out online too?

1737
02:15:24,078 --> 02:15:25,238
Once it's finalized, yeah.

1738
02:15:25,758 --> 02:15:25,959
Yeah?

1739
02:15:26,319 --> 02:15:26,479
Okay.

1740
02:15:26,519 --> 02:15:29,379
Once we're good on this, it's gonna go online, yes.

1741
02:15:30,400 --> 02:15:31,860
Okay, yeah, and that,

1742
02:15:33,398 --> 02:15:35,259
make things a lot more legible too.

1743
02:15:35,339 --> 02:15:46,545
I know we got our snappy patties and then this side looked like the kindergarten person filled it out and this side it was nice and tight so there we go.

1744
02:15:47,826 --> 02:15:49,387
I did the type side that's why.

1745
02:15:49,407 --> 02:15:58,732
But yeah it makes it more legible so if they could actually do it on the computer print it and send it to you that that would really work great.

1746
02:15:59,152 --> 02:16:00,073
I just don't have the

1747
02:16:01,523 --> 02:16:06,044
computer skills to design a form like that, but I can edit a little something.

1748
02:16:06,064 --> 02:16:06,145
Yeah.

1749
02:16:07,105 --> 02:16:13,067
No, I think the tweaks are perfect.

1750
02:16:13,467 --> 02:16:16,988
These are the things we need to know immediately by looking at these applications.

1751
02:16:17,588 --> 02:16:19,549
I think it was a great idea.

1752
02:16:19,569 --> 02:16:20,909
Yeah.

1753
02:16:20,969 --> 02:16:23,310
Also, it seems for some reason that

1754
02:16:24,845 --> 02:16:29,810
I don't know, the police detail seemed to surprise a few people about that D1.

1755
02:16:29,830 --> 02:16:35,595
Surprised Rory didn't even, you know, didn't know that right off the top of his head.

1756
02:16:35,976 --> 02:16:39,840
I thought it was any crowd over 250 people had to have a detail.

1757
02:16:40,060 --> 02:16:41,381
That's what I always thought.

1758
02:16:42,302 --> 02:16:46,927
I think we should touch base with the chief, police chief, and just kind of

1759
02:16:48,307 --> 02:16:56,056
Because I asked him before and he told me, this is why he has people reach out to the detail offices, that there's no specific rule.

1760
02:16:56,096 --> 02:16:59,079
Like if there's 100 people, you don't get a detail.

1761
02:16:59,340 --> 02:17:03,324
It depends case by case, you know what I mean?

1762
02:17:03,545 --> 02:17:07,089
But in situations like that, I'm not sure how they decide.

1763
02:17:07,289 --> 02:17:09,111
He said that it's not like a straight answer.

1764
02:17:10,896 --> 02:17:23,121
So maybe that's something we should revisit with the police department and just see if people are actually, because I know like Circle the Square and stuff, I believe they do get a detail because it's a big, big event.

1765
02:17:23,662 --> 02:17:24,602
Yeah, right.

1766
02:17:25,702 --> 02:17:34,306
But I'm not sure like any, I mean, we do have a lot of indoors, like the library does it indoor, Taos does it indoor, so we don't have to worry about that.

1767
02:17:34,386 --> 02:17:38,288
Or like when you do it a farmer's market, because it's all, you know, like kind of

1768
02:17:39,864 --> 02:17:40,644
its own space.

1769
02:17:42,325 --> 02:17:47,847
But things like that, I don't, I would assume that police would want to be there.

1770
02:17:47,867 --> 02:17:48,247
I don't know.

1771
02:17:48,307 --> 02:17:50,448
I would say you hit the nail on the head.

1772
02:17:50,508 --> 02:17:52,588
Let's, let's discuss it with the chief.

1773
02:17:53,369 --> 02:18:03,052
And maybe we can even do it at our discretion, the type of event that it is in like this soccer event.

1774
02:18:04,172 --> 02:18:09,879
especially where they've had issues in the past, then we can mandate them.

1775
02:18:10,059 --> 02:18:13,683
I would imagine that, hey, you have to get a police detail.

1776
02:18:14,184 --> 02:18:15,866
You're going to expect 600 people.

1777
02:18:15,926 --> 02:18:18,408
You have to have at least three police officers there.

1778
02:18:19,428 --> 02:18:25,896
And because of past incidents with the license on that location and that event.

1779
02:18:26,897 --> 02:18:32,063
If it's a first timer, yeah, they say you need one, you get one.

1780
02:18:32,464 --> 02:18:34,406
I mean, we say you need one.

1781
02:18:34,506 --> 02:18:36,348
I don't know if we can dictate that though.

1782
02:18:36,368 --> 02:18:37,590
I'm not really sure.

1783
02:18:38,170 --> 02:18:39,290
I don't think we can.

1784
02:18:39,310 --> 02:18:45,072
I don't think we can, and that's kind of what I understood from the chief is that it's not really up to us.

1785
02:18:45,132 --> 02:18:46,233
We can strongly recommend it.

1786
02:18:46,453 --> 02:18:48,293
Didn't we just strongly recommend it?

1787
02:18:48,313 --> 02:18:49,854
Strongly recommend, yeah.

1788
02:18:50,014 --> 02:19:03,958
It might be going out of our lane a little bit, but, you know, yeah, it's, yeah, that's something we're gonna- Yeah, because if we say that they need it and then they call the police and the police says, no, you're fine, then that just creates-

1789
02:19:05,032 --> 02:19:05,212
Yeah.

1790
02:19:05,412 --> 02:19:05,893
Conflict.

1791
02:19:06,273 --> 02:19:06,453
Yeah.

1792
02:19:06,793 --> 02:19:10,055
And one other thing real quickly, because my mush mind sometimes forgets.

1793
02:19:11,476 --> 02:19:26,806
I was asked about if I could attend a meeting tomorrow with the Chamber of Commerce and Daria, your Lisa, and the chief police chief of Afghanistan, the other thing.

1794
02:19:26,886 --> 02:19:28,227
Oh, wait, I'm there too, right?

1795
02:19:28,547 --> 02:19:30,188
Yeah, you're there tomorrow, I believe.

1796
02:19:30,448 --> 02:19:31,989
It's 11 o'clock in the morning.

1797
02:19:35,206 --> 02:19:43,068
And it's questions, I guess there's a new chamber president or something that they want questions about how they're going to handle this event, the Oktoberfest.

1798
02:19:43,788 --> 02:19:55,011
And they're going to have two alcohol suppliers, one being Metfor Brewing, I believe, and the second one was, what's the second one?

1799
02:19:57,763 --> 02:19:58,103
Maybe deep.

1800
02:19:58,143 --> 02:19:59,304
I don't think so.

1801
02:19:59,544 --> 02:20:04,689
I feel like it was, maybe it's deep cuts, but I feel like it's Medford based.

1802
02:20:07,311 --> 02:20:08,191
Which one?

1803
02:20:09,152 --> 02:20:10,874
I think it's deep cuts and Medford brewing.

1804
02:20:11,574 --> 02:20:11,894
Okay.

1805
02:20:12,335 --> 02:20:13,095
Yeah, I think you're right.

1806
02:20:13,496 --> 02:20:14,056
I think you're right.

1807
02:20:14,497 --> 02:20:21,983
But anyways, they asked how they're gonna handle that, because they're gonna have entertainment and alcohol.

1808
02:20:22,783 --> 02:20:26,466
And at first I thought, I says, well, they're gonna have the alcohol.

1809
02:20:27,902 --> 02:20:37,286
Why don't you just let Deep Cuts get their license and Medford Brewing get their license and let the chamber worry about their own entertainment.

1810
02:20:37,346 --> 02:20:41,448
But it seems that entertainment's falling on us whenever alcohol's involved.

1811
02:20:42,088 --> 02:20:45,290
So obviously that's why we're trying to build it into the application.

1812
02:20:45,530 --> 02:20:47,831
But the thing is, is that,

1813
02:20:48,771 --> 02:20:54,557
I spoke with Ralph about it when I was on the phone with him about these other things that we discussed today.

1814
02:20:55,198 --> 02:20:56,999
And he said, Bobby, you can do it two ways.

1815
02:20:57,119 --> 02:20:58,841
You can do it separate like that.

1816
02:20:59,221 --> 02:21:00,963
He says, but I'd advise you to do it.

1817
02:21:01,544 --> 02:21:02,885
Only one license.

1818
02:21:03,105 --> 02:21:04,326
Have the chamber pull it.

1819
02:21:05,207 --> 02:21:10,590
and list the two licensees that are going to be supplying the alcohol.

1820
02:21:10,630 --> 02:21:13,792
That way there, it's much easier to cordon off.

1821
02:21:14,132 --> 02:21:21,257
He said, if you don't do that, you're going to have to cordon off each section of where the alcohol is.

1822
02:21:21,737 --> 02:21:29,722
But if you have the chamber do it, you can let somebody buys from one, they can walk over to the other side of the event and not have to worry about it.

1823
02:21:30,422 --> 02:21:38,927
So he said that's the way he suggests it and that's what I'm going to present to the meeting tomorrow.

1824
02:21:40,748 --> 02:21:41,328
Very good.

1825
02:21:43,529 --> 02:21:44,570
Okay.

1826
02:21:44,830 --> 02:21:50,633
Did we need the, we got to make a motion or something on that form or is it just good to go?

1827
02:21:51,413 --> 02:21:52,974
Yeah, well, I'll make a motion.

1828
02:21:53,274 --> 02:21:58,057
I motion that we accept the new edits and changes to the one day application.

1829
02:21:59,380 --> 02:21:59,700
Okay.

1830
02:22:00,581 --> 02:22:01,941
And I can second.

1831
02:22:03,202 --> 02:22:04,242
Oh, Ben, you're still there.

1832
02:22:04,282 --> 02:22:05,483
I saw you, but I didn't see it.

1833
02:22:05,503 --> 02:22:05,723
Yeah.

1834
02:22:05,763 --> 02:22:06,003
Yeah.

1835
02:22:07,143 --> 02:22:07,383
Yeah.

1836
02:22:08,164 --> 02:22:08,804
I can second it.

1837
02:22:09,704 --> 02:22:10,125
Okay.

1838
02:22:10,965 --> 02:22:11,245
All right.

1839
02:22:11,465 --> 02:22:12,245
All those in favor?

1840
02:22:12,385 --> 02:22:12,546
Aye.

1841
02:22:12,966 --> 02:22:13,086
Aye.

1842
02:22:13,726 --> 02:22:14,486
All those opposed?

1843
02:22:15,327 --> 02:22:17,267
Hearing and seeing none, motion passes.

1844
02:22:18,108 --> 02:22:18,468
Very good.

1845
02:22:19,091 --> 02:22:20,392
Barry, thank you very, very much.

1846
02:22:20,632 --> 02:22:21,432
You did a great job.

1847
02:22:21,452 --> 02:22:22,313
No, no, thank you guys.

1848
02:22:22,533 --> 02:22:23,573
You got all this stuff out.

1849
02:22:23,974 --> 02:22:26,535
And I'll see you tomorrow on the meeting.

1850
02:22:26,795 --> 02:22:28,736
And I think that ought to do it.

1851
02:22:28,936 --> 02:22:30,978
Hopefully we won't have anything for August.

1852
02:22:31,478 --> 02:22:31,718
Right.

1853
02:22:32,598 --> 02:22:38,602
And I got Alan as a backup chair, I think, because I'm having dental surgery the week before.

1854
02:22:38,682 --> 02:22:41,663
And if I can't talk, I'll be sending you emails.

1855
02:22:42,484 --> 02:22:43,605
I'll be happy to step up.

1856
02:22:44,005 --> 02:22:44,565
My pleasure.

1857
02:22:44,645 --> 02:22:45,826
I appreciate it.

1858
02:22:46,769 --> 02:22:47,270
All right, guys.

1859
02:22:47,510 --> 02:22:48,092
Thank you, everyone.

1860
02:22:48,112 --> 02:22:49,133
Motion to adjourn.

1861
02:22:49,214 --> 02:22:49,494
All right.

1862
02:22:49,815 --> 02:22:50,015
Yes.

1863
02:22:50,376 --> 02:22:51,758
Oh, gee, I forgot, wait a minute.

1864
02:22:51,939 --> 02:22:53,541
This chair stuff ain't easy, you know.

1865
02:22:53,622 --> 02:22:56,006
You're doing great, Bobby.

1866
02:22:56,026 --> 02:22:56,747
You're doing great.

1867
02:22:57,088 --> 02:22:57,649
Oh, please.

1868
02:22:58,250 --> 02:23:02,057
Okay, I make a motion to adjourn.

1869
02:23:02,217 --> 02:23:02,999
All those in favor?

1870
02:23:03,099 --> 02:23:04,301
I'll second that motion.

1871
02:23:04,642 --> 02:23:05,483
All right.

1872
02:23:05,503 --> 02:23:06,224
Good to see you.

1873
02:23:06,305 --> 02:23:06,745
Thank you.

1874
02:23:06,826 --> 02:23:07,888
Good job, Bobby.

1875
02:23:07,968 --> 02:23:08,449
Thank you, guys.
