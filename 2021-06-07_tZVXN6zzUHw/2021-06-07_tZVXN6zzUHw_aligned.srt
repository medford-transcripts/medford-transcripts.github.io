74
00:44:44,853 --> 00:44:48,915
From May 25th, 2021, communications, strategic planning,

75
00:44:49,409 --> 00:44:53,310
and stakeholder engagement subcommittee meeting chaired by member Graham.

76
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,110
Member Graham.

77
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:54,850
Thank you.

78
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,151
We met on the 25th for about an hour and a half.

79
00:44:59,411 --> 00:45:06,112
And the subject of the meeting was really to go through the draft of the strategic plan, which we all saw last February.

80
00:45:06,512 --> 00:45:08,832
And it has been substantially updated since then.

81
00:45:08,973 --> 00:45:16,714
So we went through it in quite a bit of detail and I don't want to steal the superintendent's thunder since she will be presenting

82
00:45:18,038 --> 00:45:34,103
in more detail later on in this meeting, but a couple of things that we did talk about explicitly was really around this being a starting point and important for us to as a committee endorse and sign off on so that we can start to move forward and take action.

83
00:45:35,223 --> 00:45:40,705
We did also talk about the fact that come the fall, we'll be working on ways to

84
00:45:42,323 --> 00:45:44,304
bring the community to the plan.

85
00:45:44,384 --> 00:45:51,526
So we need to sort of start moving, but we also need to recognize that this is just the start of a plan.

86
00:45:51,566 --> 00:46:04,010
It's a living document and a sizable objective for this upcoming school year would be around seeking family, true family and authentic family engagement in the strategic plan.

87
00:46:04,641 --> 00:46:10,505
and specifically in the mission and vision, which we did talk about in our roundtables earlier this spring.

88
00:46:11,766 --> 00:46:19,892
But in the spirit of doing those things well instead of quickly, we were in agreement that those things should happen in the upcoming school year.

89
00:46:21,583 --> 00:46:42,264
We also talked about making sure that as we continue through this process that some of the task forces that we've set up, including the racial equity task force, weigh in and provide some specific and explicit feedback about some of the items in the strategic plan and really highlight for us if there are places where they feel like

90
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:49,592
the plan as it is stated, or as we set out, should be adjusted based on their work.

91
00:46:49,652 --> 00:47:01,896
And the superintendent shared some comments about that committee in terms of their work getting started, but being significantly impacted by the pandemic, the ability to meet, the really unusual nature of the school year.

92
00:47:01,956 --> 00:47:04,217
And so there's more to come, I think, from them as well.

93
00:47:05,238 --> 00:47:14,784
but we did explicitly ask that they weigh in as it relates to the strategic plan and how their recommendations will fit in.

94
00:47:15,125 --> 00:47:28,394
So, and I don't wanna steal the superintendent center because she'll be presenting later today, but I hope at that time you all will think as highly of the plan as we did in subcommittee and move to approve it.

95
00:47:28,574 --> 00:47:31,316
So I think we just need to approve the minutes at the moment.

96
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:35,795
Member McLaughlin.

97
00:47:36,215 --> 00:47:36,575
Thank you.

98
00:47:37,135 --> 00:47:51,758
I just wanted to add that we also, thank you member, through the chair to member Graham, that we also talked about other subgroups like CPAC and folks like that, ensuring their involvement as well, obviously with authentic family and community engagement.

99
00:47:52,138 --> 00:47:53,878
And with that, I would make a motion to approve.

100
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,719
Motion for approval by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Kretz.

101
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:00,800
All those in favor?

102
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:01,700
Aye.

103
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:02,520
All those opposed?

104
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,131
Motion's approved.

105
00:48:07,151 --> 00:48:13,433
5-26-2021 Buildings and Grounds Subcommittee meeting offered by member and chaired by member Kathy Kratz.

106
00:48:14,373 --> 00:48:14,573
Yes.

107
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:15,453
Hi everybody.

108
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:17,934
We had a Building and Grounds Subcommittee on May 26.

109
00:48:18,654 --> 00:48:22,055
All the documents I shared with everybody with the Building and Grounds Subcommittee folder.

110
00:48:22,996 --> 00:48:25,937
I'm gonna just summarize the meeting minutes very briefly.

111
00:48:26,417 --> 00:48:30,018
And then at the end, I'm gonna read all the motions at once.

112
00:48:30,478 --> 00:48:42,427
So we can take one roll call, there were five motions at the meeting, and I'm going to include the minutes of the meeting when I do the motion so that I don't forget because I forgot the last time, unless anybody wants to sever one of the motions.

113
00:48:43,067 --> 00:48:43,928
So here's the summary.

114
00:48:44,128 --> 00:48:46,010
First we heard from Mr. Chad Fallon.

115
00:48:46,910 --> 00:49:00,422
Mr. Cormier, electrical teacher, they shared an incredible slide deck to show the projects going on with the cement project at the main entrance of the vocational school, the new graphic art space, the electrical project, an additional interior house built, and the bistro storage unit.

116
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:06,128
Each of the projects was done by students with the CTE shop collaboration, construction, and craft labor.

117
00:49:07,008 --> 00:49:09,469
There are so many great things happening in the vocational programs.

118
00:49:10,029 --> 00:49:13,750
We revisited discussion about the signage for the front entrance of Meffitt High School.

119
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:16,130
It's difficult to know where the front entrance is.

120
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,731
We need an official sign.

121
00:49:18,931 --> 00:49:29,954
We did two polls at the meeting and we narrowed it down to a total of the top three signs, number six, seven, and two that were in the presentation for the poll slideshow.

122
00:49:30,694 --> 00:49:35,375
And we voted to ask Dr. Cushing to do a poll with the student body

123
00:49:35,865 --> 00:49:38,206
and share the results at the June 14th subcommittee meeting.

124
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:39,887
Mr. McLaughlin and Ms.

125
00:49:40,007 --> 00:49:47,029
Agitudin, Tree Warden City of Medford, spoke about all the great projects going on with the Medford High School front entrance at the corner of Winthrop Street.

126
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:53,812
The construction and craft labor students put down new mulch and low maintenance plants to beautify the front entrance corner of Winthrop Street.

127
00:49:54,412 --> 00:49:55,993
A broken fence section was replaced.

128
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,014
Several dead trees were removed.

129
00:49:58,334 --> 00:50:02,696
A total of 18 trees were planted between last fall and Arbor Day.

130
00:50:03,476 --> 00:50:10,028
We received an update from Mister Murphy regarding the high school bathroom project, the RFPs will go out over the next couple of weeks.

131
00:50:10,128 --> 00:50:12,993
The work will start over the summer before the students return in September.

132
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,201
Two solar speed signs were installed at Medford High School.

133
00:50:16,381 --> 00:50:18,642
Also, a solar speed sign was installed at the Andrews.

134
00:50:19,343 --> 00:50:21,424
I drove by it before the graduation.

135
00:50:22,264 --> 00:50:24,165
They're all set for 10 miles per hour.

136
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:31,709
Mr. McLaughlin and Alicia Hunt, Director of Energy Environment, City of Medford, spoke about the hot water system at Medford High School that must be replaced.

137
00:50:32,149 --> 00:50:33,750
We need this working for mid-August.

138
00:50:35,951 --> 00:50:39,934
Mr. McLaughlin also discussed the Curtis Tufts High School boiler.

139
00:50:40,375 --> 00:50:42,356
He also purchased sectional replacements.

140
00:50:42,496 --> 00:50:44,698
We voted to go ahead with the labor cost to repair.

141
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:48,721
The Medford High School generator is not operational.

142
00:50:48,881 --> 00:50:49,822
It must be replaced.

143
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:53,404
We took a vote to replace the Medford High School generator.

144
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:58,008
We also voted for Mr. McLaughlin to repair the Medford High School transformer.

145
00:50:58,968 --> 00:51:04,213
Mr. McLaughlin shared an informational update on the capital costs associated with the Mervitt High School pool replacement.

146
00:51:04,693 --> 00:51:09,677
This was just an informational report that he shared and information's in the building grounds folder shared with everybody.

147
00:51:10,378 --> 00:51:11,859
So now I'm gonna read the motions.

148
00:51:11,919 --> 00:51:15,702
I'm just gonna read through them all, and then we'll just do one vote.

149
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:24,930
Motion one, motion for Dr. Cushing to do a poll with the student body, the top three sign ideas from Mervitt High School, front entrance, number six, number seven, number two.

150
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:31,556
The results from the subcommittee and the student body poll will be shared at our upcoming meeting on June 14th.

151
00:51:32,257 --> 00:51:36,760
Motion number two, to proceed with the replacement of the Merritt High School hot water system.

167
00:52:24,435 --> 00:52:26,957
Will we approve the fiscal year 22 budget?

168
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:32,442
Motion to approve by Member Kretz, seconded by Member McStone.

169
00:52:32,822 --> 00:52:33,462
All those in favor?

170
00:52:34,043 --> 00:52:34,243
Aye.

171
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:35,224
All those opposed?

172
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:36,885
Minutes are approved.

173
00:52:37,846 --> 00:52:38,847
Community participation.

174
00:52:39,482 --> 00:52:47,764
Any citizen in the audience may be given permission to speak once at a school committee meeting regarding any item on the agenda for up to three minutes on any one item.

175
00:52:48,685 --> 00:52:56,947
A community participation portion of the agenda will be established, which will give any citizen the privilege of placing any item before the school committee to be heard on any item.

176
00:52:57,207 --> 00:53:06,390
Any item to be presented must be submitted in writing to the superintendent of schools by the Wednesday noon prior to the scheduled meeting with a maximum of five minutes allowed for any one presentation.

177
00:53:07,165 --> 00:53:15,413
Public participation emails, questions, or comments can be submitted during the meeting by emailing medfordsc at medford.k12.ma.us.

178
00:53:16,093 --> 00:53:21,118
Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, your question or comment.

179
00:53:21,138 --> 00:53:25,362
Do you have any emails?

180
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:25,963
Yes.

181
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:26,503
OK.

182
00:53:26,643 --> 00:53:27,304
Member van de Groot.

183
00:53:36,871 --> 00:53:38,653
It's red, is that correct?

184
00:53:38,693 --> 00:53:39,774
If it's red, then yep, you're on.

185
00:53:40,194 --> 00:53:48,182
Okay, so I received three emails regarding the start time of our school committee meetings.

186
00:53:49,263 --> 00:53:58,252
They were from Eunice Brown of 48 Greenleaf Ave., Rick Orlando from 13 Winford Way,

187
00:53:58,852 --> 00:54:04,035
and Ron and Janice Martinetti of 126 Lincoln Road.

188
00:54:05,016 --> 00:54:09,699
Each of the writers asked us to start to resume the original 7 p.m.

189
00:54:09,939 --> 00:54:10,499
start date.

190
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,123
Mayor, is it allowable for me to just condense these or do I need to read

191
00:54:18,026 --> 00:54:21,909
I think if they all are the same subject matter, you can give us a general outline.

192
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:28,054
So the request on all of them is to resume the original 7 PM start date for all our school committee meetings.

193
00:54:29,235 --> 00:54:39,123
And part of this is that now that we're back to chambers for people who want to come up in person, it's easier for people to attend.

194
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:43,366
Eunice Brown also asked that any subcommittee meetings also

195
00:54:45,153 --> 00:54:48,895
start at this time when a regular meeting does not occur.

196
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:54,818
So if one was before a meeting, I think that it sounds like she understands that would be at a different time.

197
00:54:56,218 --> 00:55:09,085
Anyway, the people spoke to the fact that they want to be able to participate and that the earlier start times makes it difficult for them to do so.

198
00:55:10,245 --> 00:55:13,387
So that is a summation of those three letters.

199
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:17,988
I know we were doing six, so we changed tonight to 630.

200
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:21,069
So it's dependent on what the committee approves.

201
00:55:21,249 --> 00:55:22,450
Can I speak to this for a moment?

202
00:55:25,551 --> 00:55:28,933
You can put a resolution on to talk about it on Monday.

203
00:55:29,913 --> 00:55:38,837
I just wanted to explain for people why we also are trying to be deferential to the people who, for employees as well, many of them who start very early in the morning.

204
00:55:40,178 --> 00:55:40,958
But I didn't speak to it.

205
00:55:40,978 --> 00:55:41,198
Thank you.

206
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:47,363
Next, we have number eight, report of our superintendent.

207
00:55:47,463 --> 00:55:49,104
Number one, superintendent's updates and comments.

208
00:55:49,164 --> 00:55:50,746
Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

209
00:55:50,766 --> 00:55:51,687
No problem.

210
00:55:52,707 --> 00:55:56,731
No, actually, okay, she said that she did get an answer from administration, sorry.

211
00:55:57,832 --> 00:55:58,773
Dr. Edwards-Vinson.

212
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:08,742
Good evening.

213
00:56:13,072 --> 00:56:16,014
So glad that we are able to meet this evening in person.

214
00:56:18,836 --> 00:56:30,364
And I have to say that it was really wonderful to see the class of 2021, that they were also able to participate in their graduation ceremony and prom last week.

215
00:56:32,345 --> 00:56:36,228
Memories made during these events will stay with our students forever.

216
00:56:37,509 --> 00:56:40,551
I must thank our incredible team for making this happen.

217
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:57,302
The High School Administration, Principal DeLeva, Principal Fallon, Assistant Principal Blauch, who oversaw all of the senior activities, Assistant Principal Fitzpatrick, and Assistant Principal Walker.

218
00:56:58,723 --> 00:57:00,363
Class Advisors, Ms.

219
00:57:00,403 --> 00:57:01,904
Giordano, Ms.

220
00:57:01,944 --> 00:57:06,525
Jones, Nurse Director Tony Ray, Ms.

221
00:57:06,565 --> 00:57:10,506
Lisa Bowler, Michael McLaughlin, Patrick Gordon,

222
00:57:12,815 --> 00:57:40,502
our Medford Vocational Technical High School student, media student, Shane Colbert, John McLaughlin, our custodians, our partners on the city side, the mayor, Maryann O'Connor from the Board of Health, Mr. Brian Cairns and the DPW staff, Kevin Bailey from Recreation, Fire Chief Gilberti,

223
00:57:41,859 --> 00:57:47,023
Police Chief Jack Buckley and Electrical Superintendent Steve Randazzo.

224
00:57:48,203 --> 00:58:05,215
It was truly a joint effort with the fire department helping with the flag and just seeing all departments working together collaboratively to make the high school graduation ceremony at Hormel a success last week.

225
00:58:06,587 --> 00:58:14,751
Additionally, I want to thank Armstrong Ambulance and Wegmans for their continued support of the Medford Public Schools.

226
00:58:15,232 --> 00:58:17,093
A special thank you to all of you.

227
00:58:19,114 --> 00:58:21,215
The prom also was a wonderful event.

228
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:39,106
I got to bump into member Vander Kloot who did contribute and just setting up and seeing how parents came, the parent group really working collaboratively, staff setting up the gymnasium and giving the students a prom experience this year.

229
00:58:40,107 --> 00:58:42,128
It really, really did fill our buckets.

230
00:58:43,089 --> 00:58:50,275
And I just want to thank again, all of our Mustangs who came out and their families, we appreciate all of your hard work.

231
00:58:50,705 --> 00:58:51,866
on behalf of our students.

232
00:58:54,308 --> 00:58:55,029
Some good news.

233
00:58:55,189 --> 00:59:01,794
Last Thursday, our Commissioner of Education, Mr. Jeff Riley, came to the Roberts School for a visit.

234
00:59:03,575 --> 00:59:06,798
The Commissioner had planned to visit us about three months ago.

235
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:15,064
As he knew, Medford was way ahead of many other surrounding districts, but his schedule at that time did not permit it.

236
00:59:16,866 --> 00:59:19,268
During that visit, we had Mayor Lungo Kern,

237
00:59:20,767 --> 00:59:34,793
school committee member Vander Kloot, state representative Paul Donato, assistant superintendent Galusi, nurse director Tony Ray, joined by our principal, principal Johnson and assistant principal O'Brien.

238
00:59:35,813 --> 00:59:40,255
As the commissioner came and got to observe our students during COVID testing,

239
00:59:41,934 --> 00:59:49,677
Then we all went on a tour and visited Mr. Connor's phenomenal music classroom where the students were drumming.

240
00:59:50,578 --> 01:00:00,142
And yes, Mr. Connor invited our commissioner up to participate in drumming and he did participate.

241
01:00:00,202 --> 01:00:09,686
He was a trooper and participated with our students and participated in the drumming and they composed beautiful music.

242
01:00:11,006 --> 01:00:18,871
Um, we then moved on to visit one of our first grade classrooms and mayor Brianna, we were able to visit her son's classroom.

243
01:00:19,371 --> 01:00:20,412
The kids were excited.

244
01:00:20,432 --> 01:00:25,035
Um, and we were accompanied during that visit by NBC news 10.

245
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:34,260
And, um, this particular visit that took place last week was also highlighted in the commissioner's communication that went out this week.

246
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:37,162
So if you look at the commissioner's communications,

247
01:00:37,958 --> 01:00:40,201
you will see that he highlights the Roberts School.

248
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:46,192
And again, it's just an opportunity to show the wonderful things that are happening in Medford Public Schools.

249
01:00:48,613 --> 01:00:58,721
Speaking of NBC 10, they were at Medford High School today to interview Mr. Dave Murphy and myself about what is Medford doing during the heat.

250
01:00:59,982 --> 01:01:11,571
Additionally, they were able to go and visit, see part of the sophomore junior class distracted driving presentation that took place, AAA.

251
01:01:13,793 --> 01:01:22,827
And I want to just thank our safety officer, Canava, Chief Buckley, who was there, Miss Stein, who was a presenter.

252
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:30,780
AAA, Distracted Driving, and Dan Strawlow from In Control Crash Prevention.

253
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:43,763
They actually did a demonstration by the West Courtyard of a vehicle going at high rates of speed and how long it took for the car to stop.

254
01:01:45,058 --> 01:01:48,680
30 something miles, 40 something, 55 and like 60 miles.

255
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:54,583
So the students were really able to see how long it took for the vehicle to stop.

256
01:01:55,364 --> 01:02:04,929
And some of the cones did get knocked over and thank God it was a demonstration, but letting them see that it could have been a person or an object.

257
01:02:05,349 --> 01:02:11,932
So again, just teaching them about being safe drivers and the importance of not being distracted.

258
01:02:12,513 --> 01:02:14,634
So that was a wonderful event today.

259
01:02:16,174 --> 01:02:22,497
Three key things that were shared during the presentation that took place in the gymnasium.

260
01:02:23,758 --> 01:02:32,242
The three types of distraction that take place while we are driving are manual, visual and cognitive.

261
01:02:33,786 --> 01:02:43,214
A manual distraction would be grabbing something, for example, with your hands or digging into your purse or a bag, looking for something while you're driving.

262
01:02:44,255 --> 01:02:55,764
A visual distraction would be reading texts or even watching movies or sports while you're driving, which does happen when a sports game is being streamed.

263
01:02:57,127 --> 01:03:04,154
A cognitive distraction is when you are impaired, and that could be by alcohol or by marijuana.

264
01:03:04,895 --> 01:03:13,344
So the students really got to learn about what distracted driving is and walk away, we hope, with

265
01:03:15,426 --> 01:03:18,588
some new knowledge to help them as they become drivers.

266
01:03:19,469 --> 01:03:29,577
During the training today, they also shared with the students that the most amount of accidents take place between Memorial Day and Labor Day.

267
01:03:30,577 --> 01:03:34,921
So this is the worst time for our young people to get in accidents over the summer.

268
01:03:35,381 --> 01:03:43,707
So I would just encourage you parents to please speak with your young adults about responsible and safe driving as we go into the summer.

269
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:44,648
Thank you.

270
01:03:46,103 --> 01:03:57,434
This week at the Andrews and the McGlynn middle schools, they will be hosting in-person open houses for their incoming sixth graders and their parents.

271
01:03:58,315 --> 01:04:01,097
On Wednesday, June 9th, it will be at the McGlynn,

272
01:04:01,798 --> 01:04:08,381
and on Thursday, June 10th at the Andrews, both schools will feature the same schedule.

273
01:04:09,041 --> 01:04:10,822
The schedule will be as follows.

274
01:04:11,362 --> 01:04:18,285
Presentations by the principals and assistant principals will begin the visit and then the tours will commence.

275
01:04:19,225 --> 01:04:25,688
In order to accommodate everyone safely, each school will feature two groups and times.

276
01:04:26,828 --> 01:04:31,889
So each student can be accompanied by one parent or guardian only.

277
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,830
All attendees must wear a mask.

278
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:42,492
Student last names that begin with letters A through K will meet from 6 p.m.

279
01:04:42,592 --> 01:04:43,773
to 6.45.

280
01:04:44,813 --> 01:04:50,734
Then students with the last names that begin with L through Z will meet from 7.15 to 8 p.m.

281
01:04:53,522 --> 01:04:58,847
Curriculum directors will be located in the gymnasiums for general questions.

282
01:04:59,488 --> 01:05:05,774
It is our hope that all incoming sixth graders and their families will be able to join us.

283
01:05:08,197 --> 01:05:14,824
Yesterday, our own CCSR was featured in the Boston Sunday Globe's Metro section.

284
01:05:16,148 --> 01:05:27,396
This article described how this program prepares young people to be future leaders in tackling societal problems ranging from climate change to racism.

285
01:05:28,397 --> 01:05:38,805
As Mr. Trotter stated, and he will be speaking later this evening with us, CCSR helps to make our world a better place, one student at a time.

286
01:05:39,485 --> 01:05:44,529
It is a positive thing where young people learn early on to care about others.

287
01:05:45,429 --> 01:05:47,050
to be compassionate leaders.

288
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:55,797
We are so very proud that this program is an integral part of the Medford schools and our community at large.

289
01:05:58,159 --> 01:06:10,048
Last week, Colin Bailey, a senior advanced placement Italian student, and one of our student school committee reps, was selected by Ms.

290
01:06:10,088 --> 01:06:14,432
Bebeau to read a passage from Dante's Inferno.

291
01:06:16,142 --> 01:06:19,425
The event was sponsored by the Embassy of Italy.

292
01:06:20,146 --> 01:06:30,176
It invited students from around the country to read a passage from Dante's literary work to commemorate the 700th anniversary of his death.

293
01:06:31,413 --> 01:06:35,056
Dante Alighieri had a major effect on the Italian language.

294
01:06:35,916 --> 01:06:49,087
By writing in a vernacular style that presented the common dialect of Florence, he reached the masses of Italy and spread the idea that there could be one Italian language for all to speak.

295
01:06:49,807 --> 01:06:52,870
Congratulations to Colin on this great honor.

296
01:06:54,611 --> 01:07:00,856
Last but not least, June is LGBTQ plus pride month.

297
01:07:01,957 --> 01:07:09,026
Pride Month is celebrated every June as a tribute to those who were involved in the Stonewall Riots.

298
01:07:10,087 --> 01:07:18,158
We at the Medford Public Schools welcome all, accept all, encourage all, and teach kindness for all.

299
01:07:19,362 --> 01:07:32,414
I was honored to join with the mayor, the GSA, CCSR, member Rousseau, member McLaughlin, and community members as the pride flag was raised at Medford City Hall.

300
01:07:33,475 --> 01:07:34,717
Truly Medford pride.

301
01:07:35,658 --> 01:07:42,884
As President Biden stated last week, during LGBTQ plus pride month,

302
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:52,742
We recognize the resilience and determination of the many individuals who are fighting to live freely and authentically.

303
01:07:53,783 --> 01:08:02,029
In doing so, they are opening hearts and minds and laying the foundation for a more just and equitable America.

304
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:13,458
This Pride Month, we affirm our obligation to uphold the dignity of all people and dedicate ourselves to protecting the most vulnerable among us.

305
01:08:14,819 --> 01:08:15,260
Thank you.

306
01:08:16,881 --> 01:08:17,922
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vinson.

307
01:08:21,244 --> 01:08:23,446
Number two, the COVID-19, I'm not sure

308
01:08:24,355 --> 01:08:32,258
public health update, Medford Public School COVID-19 testing summary and update director of health services, Ms.

309
01:08:32,298 --> 01:08:35,299
Toni Ray and assistant superintendent, Mr. David Murphy.

310
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:38,920
Good evening.

311
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:41,902
I'm going to try to do this from my home.

312
01:08:42,302 --> 01:08:45,003
So I thank you for your patience with the Zoom link.

313
01:08:45,703 --> 01:08:46,943
I hope everyone can hear me.

314
01:08:48,164 --> 01:08:48,324
Yes.

315
01:08:50,697 --> 01:08:53,322
The city of Medford remains in the green zone.

316
01:08:53,923 --> 01:08:59,876
There were 20 positive cases in the last two weeks, giving the city a 0.51 positivity rate.

317
01:09:03,258 --> 01:09:16,354
Last week, the Medford Public Schools COVID-19 testing program identified zero positive COVID-19 cases across the district while conducting 2,580 COVID tests.

318
01:09:16,995 --> 01:09:21,861
We are very proud of everyone's efforts to continue the mitigation strategies.

319
01:09:23,612 --> 01:09:35,823
As more of our students are obtaining their COVID-19 vaccines, I remind families to please submit the vaccination records to the school nurse so they can be kept on file with our health services department.

320
01:09:37,778 --> 01:09:44,141
COVID-19 surveillance testing will finish on Thursday, June 10th for all schools across the district.

321
01:09:44,902 --> 01:09:55,187
The only exception is we will test all athletes on Monday, June 14th, between 1230 PM and 230 PM at the high school.

322
01:09:56,048 --> 01:10:04,052
Testing continues to be mandatory in order for athletes to be eligible for participation in the post-season tournament games.

323
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:15,057
And lastly, I have an urgent message about the COVID-19 vaccination clinic that is scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, June 8th, from 3 p.m.

324
01:10:15,097 --> 01:10:15,898
to 6 p.m.

325
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:20,601
for students who received their first COVID vaccine on May 18th.

326
01:10:21,482 --> 01:10:25,065
The location of the clinic has been changed to the McGlynn Middle School.

327
01:10:26,647 --> 01:10:36,170
Emails containing a link for registration were sent out on Friday, June 4th, and again this afternoon to all parents of students who received their first dose.

328
01:10:37,250 --> 01:10:42,852
We strongly encourage you to register so that you have a scheduled appointment.

329
01:10:43,332 --> 01:10:43,812
Thank you.

330
01:10:51,995 --> 01:10:52,375
Thank you, Ms.

331
01:10:52,395 --> 01:10:52,495
Frey.

332
01:10:53,901 --> 01:11:04,243
Number three, recommendation to approve an anonymous donation of $2,500 to support the Haitian Flag Day celebration at Mefford High School in May, 2021.

333
01:11:04,363 --> 01:11:06,403
Dr. Maurice Edwardson.

334
01:11:08,284 --> 01:11:08,724
Thank you.

335
01:11:11,844 --> 01:11:16,145
So I am pleased to announce that the donation is no longer anonymous.

336
01:11:17,206 --> 01:11:19,246
And I would like to formally thank

337
01:11:21,687 --> 01:11:23,347
Mr. Leonard and Ms.

338
01:11:23,407 --> 01:11:43,491
Lois Green of the Leonard and Lois Green Foundation for their generous donation of $2,500 to the Medford Public Schools to cover the additional costs that occurred during the Haitian Flag Day celebration during the month of May on Tuesday, May 18th.

339
01:11:44,751 --> 01:11:47,992
This day, on that particular day, activities included

340
01:11:48,672 --> 01:11:57,940
a traditional Haitian luncheon, as well as dance classes and performances by the Jean Apollon Expressions Dance Company.

341
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:05,246
So I respectfully recommend that this gift be accepted by the Medford School Committee by a formal vote.

342
01:12:05,546 --> 01:12:06,547
Motion to approve.

343
01:12:06,567 --> 01:12:07,467
Second.

344
01:12:08,548 --> 01:12:11,451
Motion to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Roussel.

345
01:12:11,951 --> 01:12:12,672
All those in favor?

346
01:12:13,312 --> 01:12:13,472
Aye.

347
01:12:13,512 --> 01:12:14,113
All those opposed?

348
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:22,578
Yes, a letter thanking the family.

349
01:12:22,598 --> 01:12:23,819
Yep, that'd be great.

350
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:26,521
Motion is approved.

351
01:12:28,062 --> 01:12:38,470
Number four, we have report on $350,000 grant award for the Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility, known as CCSR, from the Cummings Foundation.

352
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:45,195
Dr. Maurice-Edward Vincent and Mr. Richard Trotter, and I know we have Mr. Michael Skoker in the audience as well.

353
01:12:45,597 --> 01:12:46,077
Thank you.

354
01:12:46,898 --> 01:12:54,962
So we are truly extremely grateful to the generous, generous award from the Cummings Foundation.

355
01:12:55,703 --> 01:13:04,528
The Cummings Foundation did award us $350,000, which we will be able to use over the next 10 years.

356
01:13:05,068 --> 01:13:11,572
I wanna thank Mr. Skorka and Mr. Trotter for coming to join us.

357
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:19,453
You just press the button with the little person's face and there you go, there you go.

358
01:13:19,873 --> 01:13:20,233
Thank you.

359
01:13:20,253 --> 01:13:23,795
Hi, Richard Trotter, former media director.

360
01:13:24,536 --> 01:13:28,838
Knowing how to push all the buttons was one of my forte's in the past.

361
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:38,423
So I want to say on behalf of the students and teachers and advisors that they're the ones that really got this grant.

362
01:13:38,483 --> 01:13:40,464
I was the voice, I wrote the grant.

363
01:13:41,493 --> 01:13:46,579
took their work and used it, and I sold it to Cummings.

364
01:13:46,999 --> 01:13:48,301
They love our program.

365
01:13:48,481 --> 01:13:49,522
We've been working with them now.

366
01:13:49,542 --> 01:13:55,068
This is our fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, fourteenth, thirteenth year total.

367
01:13:55,588 --> 01:13:57,971
We had a three-year grant a few years ago.

368
01:13:57,991 --> 01:13:59,252
So now there's $300,000.

369
01:13:59,293 --> 01:13:59,633
We now have

370
01:14:03,327 --> 01:14:08,917
$450,000 that have been donated by the Cummings Foundation to the kids and people of Medford.

371
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:10,740
So that's something we really want to recognize.

372
01:14:11,421 --> 01:14:13,925
And for all of us, I want to thank them for that.

373
01:14:14,729 --> 01:14:26,431
I also want to thank the superintendent central office for, they've been amazingly supportive of the program, allowing us a lot of support and flexibility and financial support as well.

374
01:14:26,511 --> 01:14:34,793
So a lot goes to the superintendent and the administration of Medford and the school committee for obviously allowing that to happen.

375
01:14:36,593 --> 01:14:42,254
I don't want to say much more except that this has been an incredible journey and this,

376
01:14:42,847 --> 01:14:47,391
This baby that has grown into now an adult has been quite an experience for us.

377
01:14:48,031 --> 01:15:01,302
And it could not have been done, really, in the long term, the last short term, without the man standing next to me, Michael Skorka, because this program started off really slowly for a couple of years, and I met Michael, and the whole world changed.

378
01:15:01,943 --> 01:15:08,749
And so, like I said, this program wouldn't be here now without him, and I just wanted to say hi, and do you have a couple of announcements?

379
01:15:09,309 --> 01:15:10,050
That'd be great, thanks.

380
01:15:11,214 --> 01:15:14,318
So we always take the opportunity to talk about upcoming events.

381
01:15:14,919 --> 01:15:16,602
So I wanted to mention two of them.

382
01:15:17,223 --> 01:15:20,407
On Saturday, we have two events happening at the same time.

383
01:15:20,487 --> 01:15:24,293
The first is in collaboration with the library and the GSA.

384
01:15:24,333 --> 01:15:27,297
We're doing a march for gay pride.

385
01:15:28,162 --> 01:15:29,863
because Gay Pride was canceled in Boston.

386
01:15:29,883 --> 01:15:32,984
So we're giving the teens an opportunity to walk in Medford.

387
01:15:33,104 --> 01:15:38,586
We've been coordinating with the police department and coming up with a run and the mayor has been super supportive as well.

388
01:15:38,746 --> 01:15:40,227
So that's happening on Saturday.

389
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:44,949
Students are showing up at 9.15 and then it's gonna be about an hour and a half walk.

390
01:15:45,689 --> 01:15:54,893
So we should be getting back to the school anywhere between 11.30 to 12 o'clock at the exact similar time, not exact time, similar time.

391
01:15:55,513 --> 01:15:58,414
We have a food drive going to three students.

392
01:15:58,814 --> 01:16:05,395
They want a $1,000 grant from Tufts to buy groceries to give out to combat food insecurity.

393
01:16:05,475 --> 01:16:07,776
And this is happening at the high school as well on Saturday.

394
01:16:08,316 --> 01:16:12,557
We have 50 bags of groceries to be to hand out first come first serve.

395
01:16:12,657 --> 01:16:13,457
No questions asked.

396
01:16:13,937 --> 01:16:15,838
It's also going to be at Medford High School from

397
01:16:17,138 --> 01:16:22,660
I believe we're gonna be packing at 9.15 and it's gonna be officially the event from 11 to one on Saturday.

398
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:28,322
So two events happening on the same day, one more event on Tuesday of next week.

399
01:16:29,063 --> 01:16:37,226
We are going to be announcing the unraveling and we are doing a ribbon cutting for our first micro pantry at Medford High School.

400
01:16:38,266 --> 01:16:40,047
Again, combating food insecurity.

401
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:42,107
We'd love for all of you to be there.

402
01:16:42,507 --> 01:16:43,628
We're gonna have, it's gonna be

403
01:16:44,068 --> 01:16:47,111
taking place at 1230 because it's a half a day on that week.

404
01:16:47,191 --> 01:16:48,292
All of the days are half a day.

405
01:16:48,832 --> 01:16:50,814
So it's going to be taking place on Tuesday.

406
01:16:51,514 --> 01:16:56,599
I believe that's the 15th at 1230 and should last approximately a half an hour.

407
01:16:57,039 --> 01:16:59,741
We're going to be putting two micro pantries into the ground.

408
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:01,082
That's the first one.

409
01:17:01,163 --> 01:17:07,368
And then the second one is going to be put at the Medford Vocational Technical High School in the fall of next year, which we'll do a separate ribbon cutting for.

410
01:17:07,768 --> 01:17:09,349
Of course, you'll all be invited to that as well.

411
01:17:09,369 --> 01:17:10,250
So we're really appreciative.

412
01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:11,031
Thank you so much.

413
01:17:11,591 --> 01:17:12,272
We're very grateful.

414
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:13,450
Thank you.

415
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:20,716
I just wanted to share the timeline because people may not know that since 2012, over $665,000 has been raised to support CCSR.

416
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:24,358
In 2012, the first $50,000 donation was made by the Bloomberg Philanthropies.

417
01:17:36,224 --> 01:17:45,428
In 2016, the Cummings Foundation awarded CCSR with the first $100,000 grant to be spent over three years.

418
01:17:46,349 --> 01:17:51,251
Then in 2018, CCSR was awarded the $125,000 award from the Crystal Campbell Community Betterment Project with the Boston Foundation.

419
01:18:00,817 --> 01:18:10,779
In 2020, they were awarded an additional $40,000 donated by the Crystal Campbell Community Betterment Project, Boston Foundation.

420
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:15,860
And then in 2021, they were just awarded a whopping $350,000.

421
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:17,361
So from the Cummings Foundation.

422
01:18:17,381 --> 01:18:17,781
Thank you.

423
01:18:17,801 --> 01:18:18,161
Thank you.

424
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:27,717
Mayor?

425
01:18:28,418 --> 01:18:29,278
Actually, can we wait?

426
01:18:29,999 --> 01:18:30,819
Member McLaughlin.

427
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:31,520
You guys come back.

428
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,822
Mr. Skorka and Mr. Trotter, can you come back so we can?

429
01:18:34,382 --> 01:18:36,644
Member McLaughlin, then Member Van de Kloet.

430
01:18:37,905 --> 01:18:38,405
Thank you.

431
01:18:38,765 --> 01:18:39,846
I just wanted to say thank you.

432
01:18:40,126 --> 01:18:45,450
And what a tremendous star you are in Medford's sky for creating compassionate leaders.

433
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:51,154
And I'm so excited to see what's going to be next with this $350,000 grant and what your goals are.

434
01:18:51,194 --> 01:18:53,456
And would love to hear more about those as well.

435
01:18:54,377 --> 01:18:56,298
And also wanted to thank you for including

436
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:03,102
the history of disability rights as civil rights in your presentation this year on diversity.

437
01:19:03,222 --> 01:19:06,903
And we had lots of students reach out to us and let us know that they did not know that history.

438
01:19:07,643 --> 01:19:10,504
So it was really wonderful that you had that included as well.

439
01:19:10,664 --> 01:19:17,486
And I'm just, I think you're an example to every district in our state and really appreciate all that you guys do.

440
01:19:17,686 --> 01:19:18,006
Thank you.

441
01:19:20,270 --> 01:19:20,490
Mayor?

442
01:19:21,210 --> 01:19:21,350
Yes.

443
01:19:21,731 --> 01:19:22,311
Member Van de Kloet.

444
01:19:23,171 --> 01:19:26,612
I too would like to just add my thanks and appreciation for all you do.

445
01:19:27,433 --> 01:19:42,198
It's so exciting each year to get to see what projects the kids are going to take on and it's just so fabulous for our district and just a sense that we're on the cutting edge with this and really appreciate it.

446
01:19:42,858 --> 01:19:45,279
I would like to ask the superintendent if you would

447
01:19:45,605 --> 01:19:52,311
make sure that a letter goes out from the school committee thanking the Cummings Foundation for their extremely generous gift to the CCSR.

448
01:19:52,771 --> 01:19:53,252
Thank you guys.

449
01:19:56,804 --> 01:20:08,688
Yes, yes, I just want to also say thank you and it's just such a pleasure, you know, just seeing all the Facebook posts that we get shared on the blog and just reading the article in the paper on Sunday and my neighbors like look at this.

450
01:20:08,708 --> 01:20:11,789
I'm like I know I know it's just a great things going on my proposed schools.

451
01:20:11,829 --> 01:20:13,570
I know there's just so many great projects.

452
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:15,651
It's just unbelievable every day.

453
01:20:15,671 --> 01:20:16,871
I'm just reading anyone.

454
01:20:17,631 --> 01:20:18,832
Thank you so much both of you.

455
01:20:18,912 --> 01:20:22,193
Thank you and everybody all the students and from the chair.

456
01:20:22,253 --> 01:20:23,954
I think it's the most amazing.

457
01:20:27,968 --> 01:20:29,749
I almost lost my words, organization.

458
01:20:31,249 --> 01:20:33,130
I mean, it's one of the best we have here in Medford.

459
01:20:33,230 --> 01:20:36,551
Hundreds and hundreds of kids have used the program to do great things.

460
01:20:36,631 --> 01:20:40,913
And I love getting the emails multiple times a week of all the projects they want to do and help they need.

461
01:20:41,533 --> 01:20:43,834
And we're always happy to help school committee in my office.

462
01:20:44,594 --> 01:20:44,895
Thank you.

463
01:20:45,075 --> 01:20:45,735
Thank you for all you do.

464
01:20:54,768 --> 01:20:58,031
Number five, we have report on the Universal Safety Committee, Ms.

465
01:20:58,111 --> 01:20:59,192
Joan Bowen and Ms.

466
01:20:59,352 --> 01:21:00,153
Tanya Sullivan.

467
01:21:06,678 --> 01:21:09,000
They will actually turn the mic on for you, Mr. Gordon.

468
01:21:11,782 --> 01:21:12,562
So you don't have to touch it.

469
01:21:13,763 --> 01:21:14,204
Don't touch it?

470
01:21:14,444 --> 01:21:15,225
Yeah, so you don't have to.

471
01:21:15,325 --> 01:21:15,765
Oh, okay.

472
01:21:16,906 --> 01:21:17,646
Thank you very much.

473
01:21:18,007 --> 01:21:21,950
Good evening, Madam Mayor, Dr. Edward Benson and school committee members.

474
01:21:22,433 --> 01:21:37,447
Tonight, I'm joined at the podium by Tanya Sullivan, who is our co-chair of CPAC, and tonight we're here to do a presentation regarding our Universal Safety Committee and the work that we've done during the school year of 2019, 2020, and this past school year.

475
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:47,857
The members of the Universal Safety Committee include myself, Jan Hollenbeck, who's our coordinator of related services,

476
01:21:48,668 --> 01:21:52,751
Miss Susanna Campbell, who's our coordinator of speech-language hearing services.

477
01:21:53,772 --> 01:21:56,494
Mr. Paul DeLeva, who's the principal of Medford High School.

478
01:21:57,094 --> 01:22:01,138
Miss Stacey Shulman, who's our supervisor of clinical and behavior services.

479
01:22:02,038 --> 01:22:04,800
Member Melanie McLaughlin, who is our school committee member.

480
01:22:05,581 --> 01:22:08,803
Craig Droschke, who's the principal at the Curtis Tufts High School.

481
01:22:09,584 --> 01:22:17,310
Tanya Sullivan, who's our co-chair of Medford CPAC, as well as the Medford Public School principals who join us on a quarterly basis.

482
01:22:20,402 --> 01:22:34,826
Our story and how we began, the Universal Safety Committee was formed in response to a 2018 scare in Medford schools that raised many questions around the equity of safety for students with disabilities in an emergency situation.

483
01:22:36,047 --> 01:22:47,170
As the Universal Safety Committee progressed to what it's become today, safety for all students, faculty, and administration are considered in the representation, planning, and goals of all of our initiatives.

484
01:22:50,082 --> 01:23:17,936
Our Universal Safety Committee mission statement, the Universal Safety Committee's commitment is to promote and maintain equity in safety within our schools and our community, and to advise the Medford School District on emergency planning, providing professional development opportunities and implementing best practices in emergencies of any kind, while delivering transparency and communication with families and guardians of students with special needs and all students.

485
01:23:18,814 --> 01:23:33,789
The Universal Safety Committee meets monthly, realizing and putting into practice ways for school staff to provide necessary accommodations organically to continue to create adaptive change in culture, demonstrating that all students are Medford students.

486
01:23:35,551 --> 01:23:41,557
Some of our accomplishments for the past two school years are the first one we did was our classroom go bags.

487
01:23:42,287 --> 01:23:51,352
These were created for all of our subseparate classrooms and they include items that individual students may need in case of an emergency.

488
01:23:51,632 --> 01:24:02,559
There may be a fidget toy, a stress ball, noise reducing headphones, a notepad to draw pictures while they're out on a fire drill, or if there's an evacuation.

489
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:04,520
We also had our second

490
01:24:05,270 --> 01:24:08,792
I believe it's our second annual safety preparedness presentation.

491
01:24:09,652 --> 01:24:20,817
And with that, we received 96 emergency go bags that we were able to distribute to the community and members of our school department and also our special education students.

492
01:24:21,697 --> 01:24:29,100
We also developed our USC resource webpage, which will be accessible to all our families and community members.

493
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:30,281
It has different

494
01:24:32,345 --> 01:24:41,569
resources that members can use and look at when items come up or questions come up about different situations that happen within the community.

495
01:24:42,109 --> 01:24:46,791
And then our last accomplishment is our individual emergency response plans.

496
01:24:47,211 --> 01:24:49,352
And these are for our students with disabilities.

497
01:24:50,312 --> 01:24:56,995
There's a discussion at their specific team meeting and we talk about what sort of specific needs that they may have.

498
01:24:57,115 --> 01:25:01,737
And we create a document that goes along with their individual education program.

499
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:09,221
And what we have next is a few pictures of the assembly of our classroom emergency go bags.

500
01:25:09,601 --> 01:25:14,043
Our project transition students took this on as a project.

501
01:25:14,583 --> 01:25:19,786
We had many donations and we also had funding from CPAC and other sources.

502
01:25:20,547 --> 01:25:25,149
It includes hand sanitizers, like I said, fidget toys, things like that.

503
01:25:25,169 --> 01:25:31,092
And the students in our project transition classroom put these together and distributed them

504
01:25:31,788 --> 01:25:33,970
across the district to our different classrooms.

505
01:25:36,391 --> 01:25:46,298
This is us organizing and distributing the home emergency go bags that we received through our emergency preparedness from Homeland Security.

506
01:25:46,998 --> 01:25:59,547
So, Tanya, Jan Hollaback, Susanna Campbell and I, we organized them according to drop-off, pickup, and we all were able to get those bags to community members who had requested them.

507
01:26:01,152 --> 01:26:03,632
And this is just another picture of the distribution.

508
01:26:04,233 --> 01:26:07,953
This is the many bags that we had in our speech and language center.

509
01:26:14,934 --> 01:26:28,697
And our goals for school year 2021 to 2022 for advocacy and awareness campaign to increase awareness and the use of smart 911, which is a program that Medford has in place already.

510
01:26:29,637 --> 01:26:30,577
If you have,

511
01:26:31,134 --> 01:26:39,877
someone in your home that has a disability or has an illness, you can note this with the SMART 911 program.

512
01:26:40,477 --> 01:26:55,481
And if there's an emergency and the fire department or the police department show up at your home, they will know that they are going to find a person or may find a person there that has the disability that's listed in the SMART 911 program.

513
01:26:56,762 --> 01:27:00,643
We're also for advocacy and awareness, the file of life when

514
01:27:01,604 --> 01:27:09,929
fire personnel or police officers show up at a home, they typically will look on a refrigerator for what's called a file of life.

515
01:27:09,989 --> 01:27:17,134
It's a magnet that lists allergies, illnesses, disabilities, and things of that nature.

516
01:27:17,855 --> 01:27:19,616
And they are trained to look there first.

517
01:27:19,836 --> 01:27:23,158
So it's something we really want to get out into the community.

518
01:27:24,119 --> 01:27:28,641
For training and resources, we would like to host our third annual emergency preparedness event.

519
01:27:30,221 --> 01:27:32,141
Emergency Preparedness Event 3.0.

520
01:27:33,382 --> 01:27:34,302
It should be amazing.

521
01:27:34,982 --> 01:27:36,802
And hopefully it will be in person this year.

522
01:27:36,822 --> 01:27:44,904
This year we did it virtually and we had a great turnout and we think it will be even better next year.

523
01:27:44,924 --> 01:27:52,145
To create and distribute pamphlet on available resources, including self-advocacy, civil rights, and ADA.

524
01:27:53,165 --> 01:27:56,306
And then monitoring of the projects that we currently have in place.

525
01:27:57,038 --> 01:28:04,540
So ensuring the continuation of these projects by refilling the classroom go bags, and ensuring the implementation of the IERs.

526
01:28:09,042 --> 01:28:10,182
And are there any questions?

527
01:28:10,282 --> 01:28:11,322
That's our presentation.

528
01:28:12,763 --> 01:28:13,483
Great job, ladies.

529
01:28:13,723 --> 01:28:14,183
Thank you.

530
01:28:15,544 --> 01:28:16,184
Member McLaughlin?

531
01:28:17,264 --> 01:28:19,245
Do you want to go first?

532
01:28:19,425 --> 01:28:22,046
I just wanted to say thank you, guys, for presenting.

533
01:28:22,106 --> 01:28:25,207
It's been such a pleasure working with you all the past two years.

534
01:28:26,632 --> 01:28:44,145
Our emergency preparedness events have been really remarkable and I want to make sure that the community knows that, you know, the work we're doing certainly originated with persons with disabilities as we thought about well how did they get out of the building in a fire or what happens in a school shooting or any of these instances and we sort of really had to start to think through those things but

535
01:28:45,133 --> 01:28:48,674
I also want to assure the community that this is for every individual.

536
01:28:49,494 --> 01:28:51,735
And that's what you learn in the emergency preparedness meeting.

537
01:28:51,775 --> 01:28:58,237
Suddenly you start to realize that we haven't thought through these things as families and as individuals, like where do we go in a crisis?

538
01:28:58,277 --> 01:29:01,978
What do we do if there's suddenly a national emergency and we have to evacuate?

539
01:29:02,038 --> 01:29:02,738
Where are we going?

540
01:29:02,778 --> 01:29:06,279
And this is sort of what the emergency preparedness program has taught.

541
01:29:06,299 --> 01:29:12,101
And so the Mass Office on Disability has partnered with us on this program and they have been really tremendous.

542
01:29:13,158 --> 01:29:14,758
you all and the IERs as well.

543
01:29:14,798 --> 01:29:19,239
I just wanted to say the individual emergency response has been a model for DESE.

544
01:29:19,759 --> 01:29:27,020
So it's sort of, it was a takeoff on the IEP, but individual emergency response also obviously are for people with and without disabilities.

545
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:30,941
Some people might break a foot, need additional assistance, what have you.

546
01:29:30,961 --> 01:29:33,662
So these can be made available to all individuals.

547
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:36,082
So this has been a really remarkable program in our districts.

548
01:29:36,282 --> 01:29:41,163
And I wanna ensure open invitations to the community

549
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:44,542
invitations to our school committee members or community members.

550
01:29:45,283 --> 01:29:50,207
The meetings occur the last Friday of the month at 8am prompt.

551
01:29:52,108 --> 01:29:57,933
In the future, we'll be in the superintendent's conference room.

552
01:29:58,373 --> 01:30:01,475
So the equity and safety, I want to thank you all for that.

553
01:30:01,535 --> 01:30:04,938
You have really brought that to our district as well and the importance of that and really took

554
01:30:05,417 --> 01:30:09,158
you know, a concerning situation and made the best of it and continue to make the best of it.

555
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:17,720
And those emergency go bags for people who don't know what's in there, there's everything from chargeable flashlights to crank radios to, you know, just an amazing toolkit.

556
01:30:17,760 --> 01:30:18,900
So thank you guys so much.

557
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:19,880
Thank you.

558
01:30:21,301 --> 01:30:23,181
I just wanted to say thank you as well.

559
01:30:23,401 --> 01:30:34,644
It's wonderful having a fabulous partnership with our CPAC, with the Universal Safety Committee, and just knowing that when we need feedback or advice,

560
01:30:35,249 --> 01:30:38,972
Tanya, thank you always for your willingness to support the district.

561
01:30:39,632 --> 01:30:48,278
And this is a wonderful example of how partnerships can really work to enhance and strengthen the district.

562
01:30:48,618 --> 01:30:50,720
And I'm just thankful.

563
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:51,981
So thank you very much.

564
01:30:52,001 --> 01:30:52,221
Thank you.

565
01:30:52,241 --> 01:30:52,861
It's our pleasure.

566
01:30:53,042 --> 01:30:53,422
Thank you.

567
01:30:54,443 --> 01:30:54,783
Thank you.

568
01:30:57,405 --> 01:31:00,447
On number six, we have CPAC report presented by Ms.

569
01:31:00,707 --> 01:31:02,008
Alex Lark and Ms.

570
01:31:02,048 --> 01:31:04,930
Tanya Sullivan, co-chairs of the special education

571
01:31:05,472 --> 01:31:06,692
Parent Advisory Council.

572
01:31:06,712 --> 01:31:11,173
I feel like it's been years.

573
01:31:15,854 --> 01:31:23,696
So we are here to present for the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council, Madam Mayor, Superintendent, and school committee members.

574
01:31:25,377 --> 01:31:29,698
The board members are Alex Lorak and myself.

575
01:31:29,838 --> 01:31:31,818
We are the co-chairs of BCPAC.

576
01:31:32,468 --> 01:31:37,011
Our treasurer is Jamil Webb Davis, and our secretary is Anne Herzog Russo.

577
01:31:38,052 --> 01:31:45,238
Membership includes students, families, and guardians of children on IEPs, 504s, and any other interested parties.

578
01:31:46,579 --> 01:31:55,185
The Medford CPAC is always looking for parents or guardians of children with special needs and other interested parties, including students, to be a part of our community.

579
01:31:55,705 --> 01:31:59,088
If you would like to learn more about how to get involved with the Medford CPAC,

580
01:31:59,563 --> 01:32:03,345
please email medford.cpac at gmail.com.

581
01:32:05,546 --> 01:32:06,387
We would love to have you.

582
01:32:08,548 --> 01:32:09,028
Our mission.

583
01:32:09,068 --> 01:32:10,029
So what is CPAC?

584
01:32:10,069 --> 01:32:12,750
Some people watching may not know what CPAC is.

585
01:32:13,431 --> 01:32:26,918
Our purpose is to fulfill the directive stated in Chapter 71B of the Massachusetts General Laws, which requires a school district to establish a PAC, Parent Advisory Council, and assigns both an advisory and a participatory function to the PAC.

586
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:42,836
In meeting this requirement, the mission of the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council is to advise the district on matters that pertain to the education and safety of students with disabilities by seeking input from the special education parent members.

587
01:32:44,117 --> 01:32:45,957
We meet regularly with school officials.

588
01:32:47,298 --> 01:32:52,600
We participate in the planning, development, and evaluation of the school district's special education program.

589
01:32:53,374 --> 01:32:57,997
and we participate in planning workshops and activities as prioritized by the CPAC board.

590
01:33:00,218 --> 01:33:02,699
We have some highlights to let you know about.

591
01:33:02,719 --> 01:33:08,223
There's a couple pages of them, so sorry if we're going on and on, but we were very busy this year.

592
01:33:08,263 --> 01:33:11,064
This has been a crazy year for everybody.

593
01:33:12,125 --> 01:33:15,867
The CPAC co-chairs, Alex and myself, were involved in the Medford reopening strategy.

594
01:33:16,808 --> 01:33:22,351
I was part of the district-wide reopening task force, and Alex was part of the McGlynn reopening team.

595
01:33:23,522 --> 01:33:31,066
CPAC hosted four Q&A sessions with Joan Bowen to address questions, concerns, and challenges our families experienced regarding school reopening.

596
01:33:32,086 --> 01:33:35,067
The feedback on that, I will say, was tremendous.

597
01:33:35,548 --> 01:33:48,194
Parents so appreciated that, and they so appreciated Joan taking the time to actually participate in the Q&As and offer explanations and valuable information.

598
01:33:48,914 --> 01:33:51,995
The four sessions were held during August, September, and October of 2020.

599
01:33:54,307 --> 01:34:04,229
CPAC participated in the tiered focused monitoring process and received a commendable rating, recognizing the collaboration among district leadership, the CPAC and the school committee.

600
01:34:04,669 --> 01:34:07,889
There's still much work to do moving forward and we look forward to our next steps.

601
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:18,351
CPAC has continued advocacy for the adoption of a disability awareness curriculum in Medford public schools and is presented to the curriculum subcommittee.

602
01:34:18,991 --> 01:34:22,192
We continue to collaborate with the special education department

603
01:34:22,729 --> 01:34:26,252
and with the curriculum subcommittee to advance issues important for our community.

604
01:34:27,413 --> 01:34:33,699
Both Alex and I were panelists for the disability awareness professional development program offered to teachers and administration.

605
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:39,424
And Alex was part of Medford team and the Desi sponsored family school partnership initiative.

606
01:34:41,185 --> 01:34:47,391
CPAC offered several content rich presentations throughout the school year, new for the school year of 2020 and 2021,

607
01:34:49,629 --> 01:34:56,875
CPAC presentations qualified as PDP credits for teachers and staff who attended the presentations.

608
01:34:57,015 --> 01:35:17,050
And the topics included basic rights to evaluation and eligibility, transition planning and services for students 14 and over, understanding dyslexia with a focus on Orton-Gillingham reading instruction, out-of-district community connections, differentiated curriculum accommodations and modifications,

609
01:35:17,773 --> 01:35:21,396
and vocational presentation on opportunities for students on IEPs.

610
01:35:24,718 --> 01:35:30,322
CPAC goals, we're focused on moving the disability awareness curriculum forward for students in all schools.

611
01:35:30,903 --> 01:35:41,291
Through this disability awareness curriculum, students will develop understanding and respect for fellow students with physical, intellectual, sensory, and developmental disabilities.

612
01:35:42,151 --> 01:35:46,895
The curriculum will provide age appropriate information that highlights the unique perspectives

613
01:35:47,638 --> 01:35:50,320
and strength people of all abilities bring to our community.

614
01:35:51,140 --> 01:35:54,062
This will begin with a pilot program being implemented in the fall.

615
01:35:55,163 --> 01:36:14,676
We will also continue to serve on the special education and behavioral health subcommittee where for the special education part of this committee, forming authentic peer friendships in school and in community and for the behavioral health side of it, the trauma informed schools to really have our schools be on point

616
01:36:15,998 --> 01:36:17,519
when it comes to being trauma informed.

617
01:36:17,539 --> 01:36:23,063
So we have a lot of great people in the district that are helping us work on that as well.

618
01:36:25,205 --> 01:36:29,168
And we actually have a few awards we wanted to give out every year.

619
01:36:29,228 --> 01:36:39,035
CPAC presents an award or awards to members in the district who for the current school year have embodied what it means to go above and beyond for our students and families.

620
01:36:39,456 --> 01:36:43,539
So as we read the names, we request that each person come up and then

621
01:36:44,893 --> 01:36:49,555
remain up here until they're all done so we can get a photo up.

622
01:36:50,716 --> 01:36:51,736
Mel, do you mind taking the picture?

623
01:36:51,836 --> 01:36:52,076
Okay.

624
01:36:53,457 --> 01:36:58,319
Okay, our first person, I'll read what I have here.

625
01:36:58,779 --> 01:37:01,300
So our first award is going to go to Carla Andre.

626
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,841
Carla is a fifth-year teacher.

627
01:37:03,861 --> 01:37:05,042
Yes, absolutely.

628
01:37:08,774 --> 01:37:12,096
Carla is a fifth year teacher in the access program at Medford High School.

629
01:37:12,676 --> 01:37:16,438
The access program, for those that don't know, is a life skills based program.

630
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:21,561
It's focused on functional academics, independent living skills, and community interactions.

631
01:37:22,242 --> 01:37:27,585
Carla has always been a think outside the box educator, and this past year was no exception.

632
01:37:28,145 --> 01:37:36,090
Carla took the pandemic as a personal challenge and raised the bar on new ways of teaching her students and providing virtual community experiences.

633
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:42,093
She was integral in transitioning students to virtual and back to in-person, making it look seamless.

634
01:37:42,793 --> 01:37:47,655
Thank you, Carla.

635
01:37:49,376 --> 01:37:52,238
Our second award goes to Denise Desjardins.

636
01:37:52,978 --> 01:37:55,339
She is the district-wide physical therapist.

637
01:38:02,143 --> 01:38:04,564
She is not happy that she has to come up here, but that's okay.

638
01:38:05,832 --> 01:38:12,995
Denise provides PT services, physical therapy services in three of our elementary schools, both middle schools and Medford Vocational.

639
01:38:13,555 --> 01:38:21,778
If a student requires PT services through their IEP, chances are Denise has worked with them, advocated and provided support for them and their families.

640
01:38:22,638 --> 01:38:32,982
During the pandemic, Denise worked tirelessly with families and students to transition from school to remote learning, from elementary to middle school and from remote learning back to in-person

641
01:38:33,448 --> 01:38:37,330
and I'm sure I have forgotten something because she does so much in this district.

642
01:38:38,390 --> 01:38:39,071
Thank you, Denise.

643
01:38:44,613 --> 01:38:48,415
Our third and final award we'd like to give to Joan Bowen.

644
01:38:55,038 --> 01:39:03,002
Having worked in the district for many years, Joan became the Director of Special Education and Pupil Services in 2019, right before all this craziness happened.

645
01:39:03,513 --> 01:39:18,283
Just in time for the COVID pandemic, we are offering this award for outstanding collaboration with CPAC, transparency of the special education process during the pandemic, and her advocacy for the speedy in-person return to school for children with high needs.

646
01:39:19,184 --> 01:39:25,148
We are also offering this award to Mrs. Bowen on behalf of all special education teachers and service providers in Medford.

647
01:39:25,566 --> 01:39:30,991
who were the first to return to school in person, while also making remote learning work for students with special needs.

648
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:33,774
They were truly frontline workers during this pandemic.

649
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:40,440
Thank you.

650
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:40,741
Mayor.

651
01:39:40,761 --> 01:39:42,202
Do you want to take a picture?

652
01:39:42,242 --> 01:39:42,462
Yeah.

653
01:39:42,482 --> 01:39:44,424
Can we get a picture with the school committee, actually?

654
01:39:44,484 --> 01:39:45,365
Can you guys come right in here?

655
01:39:47,307 --> 01:39:48,868
And then may I, Mayor, just for a moment?

656
01:39:49,088 --> 01:39:49,769
Yes, Member Rubio.

657
01:39:49,869 --> 01:39:58,195
Also, I just wanted to say thank you to our co-chairs for our CPAC and your tireless efforts in advocating for students with and without disabilities and the folks that are here.

658
01:39:58,235 --> 01:40:03,498
I also want to say Denise Desjardins was distributing lunch to students all summer long.

659
01:40:04,239 --> 01:40:04,639
And Ms.

660
01:40:04,739 --> 01:40:10,183
Andre was doing a presentation on differentiated curriculum to make sure that we're presuming competence for every student in our schools.

661
01:40:10,683 --> 01:40:14,226
So they're just really wonderful examples of folks here.

662
01:40:14,266 --> 01:40:16,347
So a community shot would be great with us.

663
01:40:17,799 --> 01:40:28,401
And Mayor, I just also want to congratulate and thank our dynamic duo team, Tanya and Alex for their incredible energy.

664
01:40:29,401 --> 01:40:34,782
I really, when I get to attend the meetings, you're great.

665
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:36,482
Thank you so much for all the work you do.

666
01:40:38,683 --> 01:40:39,083
Thank you.

667
01:40:48,837 --> 01:40:49,478
I never did.

668
01:41:36,809 --> 01:41:38,574
Thank you very much.

669
01:42:09,253 --> 01:42:11,535
Some great things, okay.

670
01:42:12,355 --> 01:42:16,517
Number seven, recommendation to approve Medford Public Schools strategic plan updates.

671
01:42:16,577 --> 01:42:19,759
Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, Dr. Peter Cushing, and Ms.

672
01:42:19,779 --> 01:42:20,579
Suzanne Galluzzi.

673
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:24,641
And I'm also going to call forward Ms.

674
01:42:24,761 --> 01:42:26,602
Susanna Campbell as well.

675
01:42:26,622 --> 01:42:27,483
So this

676
01:42:28,089 --> 01:42:37,932
This evening, we're going to be presenting the revised strategic plan to the entire school community.

677
01:42:39,853 --> 01:42:44,614
This is what the cover page would look like if you were looking at it online.

678
01:42:44,634 --> 01:42:55,918
And what we're going to present today is an abbreviated version of what was presented at our

679
01:42:58,042 --> 01:43:04,508
communications, strategic planning and engagement subcommittee meeting with member Graham as the chair.

680
01:43:06,529 --> 01:43:08,431
That was a lengthy presentation.

681
01:43:08,491 --> 01:43:22,343
We're going to try to shrink that presentation down, but at the same time, try to give you an idea of what the revised strategic plan, our strategy for district improvement looks like.

682
01:43:27,657 --> 01:43:53,305
I do want to say, as I talk about the documentation that went into getting this, I would be remiss if I didn't mention there's a smaller group of us, and we worked collaboratively with all of our administrators, but then there was more of a tactical team that really took the feedback that was coming in and worked very closely on this.

683
01:43:53,385 --> 01:43:56,946
And so I want to recognize Principal Nick Tucci,

684
01:43:58,610 --> 01:43:58,770
Ms.

685
01:43:58,790 --> 01:44:05,112
Susanna Campbell, Lisa Vangelista, Dr. Riccadeli, Ms.

686
01:44:05,132 --> 01:44:08,373
Suzanne Galluzzi, Dr. Cushing, Ms.

687
01:44:08,393 --> 01:44:20,957
Stacey Shulman, and Principal DeLeva, who were a part of the tactical team helping us pull this district strategy for improvement together.

688
01:44:21,737 --> 01:44:24,558
The documents that went into creating this

689
01:44:27,371 --> 01:44:56,638
Not only did we take into consideration data from DESE, city and district surveys, district administration feedback, the mayor's education transition subcommittee meeting that took place at the McGlynn school, and also the Medford mayoral transition committee recommendations that were taken into consideration for this, our district strategy for improvement.

690
01:45:02,394 --> 01:45:19,642
The genesis of our district strategic plan, this was an official requirement from the new superintendent induction program, which is a program sponsored by DESE, the department of education for all new superintendents.

691
01:45:20,663 --> 01:45:29,387
And this was one of the key documents that they want all districts to be able to have housed in one area

692
01:45:29,943 --> 01:45:32,465
what is our district strategy for improvement.

693
01:45:33,286 --> 01:45:42,435
So this document is the reinvention of what used to be known as the Medford Public Schools District Improvement Plans.

694
01:45:44,078 --> 01:45:53,301
We had leadership retreats and many meetings with administration to inform what went into this plan.

695
01:45:54,182 --> 01:46:08,507
It was a cross disciplinary team of administrators who represented elementary, middle, and high school levels, special education, social emotional learning, curriculum, and central office.

696
01:46:09,787 --> 01:46:12,348
And we also took into consideration

697
01:46:12,878 --> 01:46:22,161
pandemic concerns, and greater racial awareness that allowed the district team to re-examine our priorities.

698
01:46:24,942 --> 01:46:31,284
So as I had shown, this is what the document looks like.

699
01:46:32,444 --> 01:46:41,907
If you were looking at it, there are four key categories that we've identified as achievement, collaboration,

700
01:46:42,506 --> 01:46:44,148
equity, and support.

701
01:46:44,868 --> 01:46:47,971
Achievement represents student growth and achievement.

702
01:46:48,772 --> 01:46:51,534
Collaboration is collaborative relationships.

703
01:46:52,495 --> 01:46:55,358
Equity is equitable learning opportunities.

704
01:46:56,199 --> 01:47:06,148
And the S of safety and support, supportive learning, safe and supportive learning environments.

705
01:47:08,972 --> 01:47:19,954
I am now going to transition to Dr. Cushing, who's going to explain to us the action plan and talk about the draft example.

706
01:47:20,534 --> 01:47:21,154
Dr. Cushing?

707
01:47:25,875 --> 01:47:27,335
Just tap the face, thank you.

708
01:47:28,636 --> 01:47:29,296
Good evening, ma'am.

709
01:47:31,616 --> 01:47:32,176
Dr. Cushing?

710
01:47:32,456 --> 01:47:35,497
Mr. Patrick?

711
01:47:41,297 --> 01:47:43,379
Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

712
01:47:43,760 --> 01:47:46,402
Thank you for the opportunity to be part of the team presenting tonight.

713
01:47:46,983 --> 01:47:52,548
So in the previous slide, you had seen the present one page presentation.

714
01:47:53,108 --> 01:48:01,416
Each one of those hyperlinks clicks to a full page document that looks similar to this.

715
01:48:01,476 --> 01:48:02,557
This would be the top section.

716
01:48:03,903 --> 01:48:06,446
It lists the section that is in.

717
01:48:06,486 --> 01:48:10,551
So this is pulled from collaborative relationships initiative three.

718
01:48:12,233 --> 01:48:13,995
It then lists the actual initiative.

719
01:48:14,055 --> 01:48:20,302
So in this case, engage in timely, thoughtful, two-way, culturally-professional communication with the Medford Mustang community.

720
01:48:20,898 --> 01:48:24,322
It talks about early indicators of success that we'll talk about later.

721
01:48:24,843 --> 01:48:29,008
What are some of the anticipated outcomes of this specific initiative?

722
01:48:29,668 --> 01:48:31,771
Who's the leadership team required for it?

723
01:48:32,231 --> 01:48:41,102
And then what are the resources needed, budgetary time, whatever it may be for us to actually fulfill this initiative to its full potential.

724
01:48:42,090 --> 01:48:53,258
Then the second part of the page are the actual action items, the outputs that will go with them, who specifically is responsible, and then a brief timeline.

725
01:48:53,838 --> 01:49:04,025
So for each and every initiative contained within the strategic plan, there's a sub document that carries forward the actual action items of this.

726
01:49:04,846 --> 01:49:06,307
And I'll now turn it over to Ms.

727
01:49:06,327 --> 01:49:06,767
Galussi.

728
01:49:10,805 --> 01:49:12,045
Thank you very much, Dr. Cushing.

729
01:49:12,686 --> 01:49:14,426
Thank you, Madam Mayor and members of the school committee.

730
01:49:15,026 --> 01:49:16,607
I'm just going to talk the next piece.

731
01:49:16,847 --> 01:49:26,670
We wanted to make sure that this document is accessible to the entire community so that you will know that there is a glossary of terms that will be included in the strategic plan.

732
01:49:27,301 --> 01:49:41,571
Just a brief example, there's several terms in this document, but just a brief example are located here so that parents can, or community members can look and see what we're referencing in certain items of this plan.

733
01:49:41,591 --> 01:49:52,039
You'll see that this brief example just gives an explanation for what a 504 plan is, what a BCBA is, it's an employee within the city, it will explain,

734
01:49:54,197 --> 01:49:58,218
Credit for Life, which is an organization that works each year with high school students.

735
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:04,300
So we just want to make sure that this plan, when members of the community are reading it, is accessible to all.

736
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,621
So you'll also find a glossary of terms.

737
01:50:07,882 --> 01:50:11,123
Moving forward with the rest, I'm going to start off with the achievement bucket.

738
01:50:11,603 --> 01:50:17,605
I just want to say Dr. Cushing and Dr. Wadvinson gave a very nice overview of the strategic plan.

739
01:50:18,545 --> 01:50:19,846
What you're going to notice here is

740
01:50:21,230 --> 01:50:32,439
just a high level, a more detailed, as Dr. Cushing mentioned, it was provided to the school committee and will eventually be posted on the website for those to see the more, the sub documents that Dr. Cushing was referring to.

741
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:37,964
So in the achievement objective, there are going to be four initiatives.

742
01:50:39,185 --> 01:50:46,851
You'll notice that as I speak about them, these initiatives start at like a foundational level and move forward that way.

743
01:50:46,951 --> 01:50:50,594
So for example, the first initiative is going to talk about curriculum.

744
01:50:51,045 --> 01:51:08,859
and then move into an effective instruction, and then common assessments to make sure that we can monitor the curriculum that we're utilizing and ensuring that the instruction matches that, and how we can use technology efficiently to wrap that all together in a nice little package.

745
01:51:08,919 --> 01:51:14,283
So this first one, as I mentioned, is establish an ongoing curriculum review cycle.

746
01:51:14,743 --> 01:51:19,867
So the anticipated outcomes for this would be an alignment of curriculum with the Massachusetts frameworks,

747
01:51:20,687 --> 01:51:29,190
assessing curriculum for bias, which we do annually through the use of a rubric tool and professional development to support curriculum.

748
01:51:29,691 --> 01:51:35,733
Now we are in the process of a lot of alignment right now with our curriculum here in the city of Medford.

749
01:51:36,673 --> 01:51:42,616
As standards are being updated through the department of education, we have to align our curriculum.

750
01:51:42,716 --> 01:51:48,158
And as such, we're in the process of that through the humanities department, as well as the math department.

751
01:51:49,726 --> 01:51:56,259
The second initiative is the use of evidence-based instructional practices to implement the curriculum.

752
01:51:57,063 --> 01:52:02,224
So the anticipated outcomes for that are educators utilize teaching practices proven to work.

753
01:52:02,884 --> 01:52:05,344
Students are both challenged and supported.

754
01:52:06,185 --> 01:52:10,085
Students engage in academic conversations and metacognitive activities.

755
01:52:10,945 --> 01:52:15,266
All students have access to instruction that benefit their learning style and progression.

756
01:52:15,886 --> 01:52:19,287
Instructional feedback is rich, authentic, and targeted.

757
01:52:20,027 --> 01:52:26,128
And so these outcomes are aligned with the five core actions that Dr. Vincent has brought with her

758
01:52:26,578 --> 01:52:28,359
here to the Medford Public Schools.

759
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:35,163
We work with this, with building leaders, as well as department heads and teachers.

760
01:52:35,944 --> 01:52:41,928
That focus is continuing next year, as well as training and integration.

761
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:50,693
The third initiative is to implement common assessments to inform instruction and make modifications to our current curriculum.

762
01:52:51,832 --> 01:53:10,181
Anticipated outcomes are utilization of student data to inform instruction, data to better identify students in need of additional support interventions and enrichment, growth determination per student, and streamline and update district-wide assessment schedule.

763
01:53:10,902 --> 01:53:16,685
So this outcome, I think, speaks crucially to the work that we have ahead of us.

764
01:53:17,045 --> 01:53:18,646
A lot of this is in place.

765
01:53:19,366 --> 01:53:28,428
but we need to refine, align, and enhance what we currently have in place due to what COVID has done to disrupt student learning.

766
01:53:28,988 --> 01:53:41,811
So a big focus next year will be on developing reporting systems and progress monitoring through the enhancement of our school-based data teams.

767
01:53:41,831 --> 01:53:43,191
So we'll have a lot of work on that.

768
01:53:43,351 --> 01:53:47,312
Another piece to this is finalizing our early literacy screener.

769
01:53:47,932 --> 01:53:57,860
which we've been piloting for the past two years, as well as coming up with common assessments district-wide with a norm-based assessment tool.

770
01:53:59,001 --> 01:54:10,549
That way we have district-wide data with common goals and terminology to help us with our progress monitoring of students, ensuring they get what they need.

771
01:54:11,370 --> 01:54:16,714
And the final initiative is provide instructional technology that meets the curricular needs of educators and learners

772
01:54:17,764 --> 01:54:37,058
Those anticipated outcomes are to create a district technology plan, which I think is the biggest outcome and piece of this, which means we are going to assess our infrastructure, personnel, digital resources, and staff development needs, and then work really hard to create a plan and implement that plan.

773
01:54:38,228 --> 01:54:57,037
engage stakeholders to support the effective use of instructional technology and digital learning resources, assessment of current technology management and infrastructure staff and recommendations for future growth, critical elements necessary for effectively utilizing technology for teaching and learning identified and implemented.

774
01:54:58,238 --> 01:55:02,640
I'm now going to pass off to Dr. Cushing to speak to you about the collaborative

775
01:55:05,821 --> 01:55:06,241
Thank you, Ms.

776
01:55:06,261 --> 01:55:07,881
Galussi, appreciate the handoff.

777
01:55:09,202 --> 01:55:17,463
So a critical part of our district's strategic plan is the collaboration with the many various stakeholders that we have in Medford.

778
01:55:18,183 --> 01:55:23,704
And so we're gonna create a culture of collaboration through consistent community engagement.

779
01:55:24,524 --> 01:55:29,125
So our first initiative is to build and sustain community partnerships that improve school effectiveness.

780
01:55:29,685 --> 01:55:31,466
So why do we wanna do these?

781
01:55:33,306 --> 01:55:36,207
It's specifically to improve student outcomes.

782
01:55:36,427 --> 01:55:39,708
So how can we leverage community partnerships to improve student outcomes?

783
01:55:39,728 --> 01:55:48,191
We want to enhance the professional development opportunities and resources that are available to our faculty and staff.

784
01:55:48,671 --> 01:55:53,092
And we also want to create educational opportunities for students both during and after school.

785
01:55:53,492 --> 01:56:02,435
So how are we using not only students at the high school to go out and be members of the community, but how are we looking to the community to support our initiatives

786
01:56:03,732 --> 01:56:10,354
across the district so that we have these great enriching opportunities for the community to be a part of.

787
01:56:11,114 --> 01:56:12,114
So that's initiative C1.

788
01:56:12,174 --> 01:56:18,356
C2 is ensure that all family members are welcomed members of the school community.

789
01:56:19,236 --> 01:56:27,838
So our anticipated outcomes, families will feel more included and informed in district decision making and develop pride and ownership of the school system.

790
01:56:28,298 --> 01:56:47,449
So what we're hoping to do here is to really leverage that sense of ownership that Medford residents, Medford families, and Medford students have in their district to really advance and move the district forward back to C1 to improve student outcomes, like trying to draw it all back to how do we improve student outcomes.

791
01:56:48,309 --> 01:56:57,875
And moving on to initiative three, engage in timely, thoughtful two-way communication that is both culturally proficient

792
01:56:58,603 --> 01:57:06,490
and really engages the community in like finding ways to look at how we can have a better two-way operation.

793
01:57:06,950 --> 01:57:16,679
So as a result of the school inmate audit, this is a great information audit that has been done with the Medford Public Schools this year.

794
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:23,965
And just in the initial findings has really opened our eyes to how we can better support

795
01:57:24,422 --> 01:57:27,364
the community and we're looking forward to more of that information coming in.

796
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:34,009
So as a result of the school and main audit, the district will be better positioned to anticipate and support the school community.

797
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:43,456
Improved communication engagement with caregivers and stakeholders, increased trust and support and just give me a second while I move the zoom window.

798
01:57:45,057 --> 01:57:47,198
and once again, improve student outcomes.

799
01:57:47,758 --> 01:57:55,260
One of the major action steps under this initiative is the development of a district marketing communications plan.

800
01:57:55,280 --> 01:58:12,125
All right, so a really concrete document that provides clear, well thought out direction for how the district, which is a major part of the Medford community, communicates with that community.

801
01:58:12,620 --> 01:58:26,552
and provides guidelines for all of our major stakeholders within the district, our principals, assistant principals, directors, as to how we can present the phenomenal things that the Medford Public Schools is doing on a daily basis.

802
01:58:26,952 --> 01:58:34,958
So that our community members, many of whom who are here with us today or online in Zoom can feel like, wow, that is really incredible.

803
01:58:35,719 --> 01:58:35,999
And, um,

804
01:58:37,342 --> 01:58:41,744
I want to get out there and make every day a great day to your Mustang for our students.

805
01:58:42,304 --> 01:58:48,106
So once again, wrapping it back to how our, uh, how we're improving student outcomes.

806
01:58:49,367 --> 01:58:58,331
Uh, finally, uh, working collaboratively initiative C4 working collaboratively with community stakeholders to appropriate budgetary resources.

807
01:58:59,091 --> 01:59:03,993
Uh, so budget documents and easy to read and non-financial terms.

808
01:59:04,433 --> 01:59:07,694
I think it's very easy, like we were talking about the glossary of terms earlier.

809
01:59:08,054 --> 01:59:23,159
It's very easy to overwhelm people with education speak and financial literacy speak that when we start talking about how governments finance and fund our school districts, but we wanna make that really boiled down and distilled so it's very easy to understand.

810
01:59:23,579 --> 01:59:27,160
And that's through the earlier initiatives of the marketing communications plan.

811
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:32,221
Once again, the citizens of Medford were like, wow, our schools are doing amazing things.

812
01:59:32,601 --> 01:59:34,102
We need to continue to support them

813
01:59:35,112 --> 01:59:36,552
through those things.

814
01:59:36,612 --> 01:59:47,014
Another thing is very technical, a transition to Munis, which is a governmental software that makes everything flow and move very easily.

815
01:59:47,974 --> 01:59:55,916
Again, a more detailed presentation is online at the district's YouTube channel from last week when we presented to the subcommittee.

816
01:59:56,436 --> 02:00:03,517
At this time, I'm gonna hand it off to Mrs. Susanna Campbell to take us into equity.

817
02:00:07,498 --> 02:00:07,978
Good evening.

818
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:13,222
Equity represents equitable learning opportunities.

819
02:00:13,982 --> 02:00:24,629
Specifically, the district's objective is to understand the needs of our diverse population and support the academic, social, emotional, and physical needs of our students.

820
02:00:25,530 --> 02:00:32,594
As you will see through the five initiatives under this objective, as a district, we believe in supporting the whole student.

821
02:00:33,435 --> 02:00:36,637
Our first initiative is increase the support and understanding

822
02:00:37,154 --> 02:00:40,415
of the health, wellness, and social-emotional needs of our students.

823
02:00:45,398 --> 02:01:05,747
The anticipated outcomes are that we will have a social-emotional inventory to share with the public, social-emotional resources that are available to all faculty, social-emotional learning plan, excuse me, learning action plan, professional development plan, increased ability

824
02:01:06,375 --> 02:01:19,424
for students to access the curriculum, increased students' social-emotional skills, data cycles and screenings will be established, and we will have increased evidence-based groups for counseling.

825
02:01:20,625 --> 02:01:30,552
An example of one action item from this initiative is an annual assessment of the district's current, thank you, of the district's current social-emotional learning programming.

826
02:01:31,292 --> 02:01:34,895
Each year, the district will identify areas of strength and need.

827
02:01:35,907 --> 02:01:41,672
This information will be used to develop social-emotional learning action plans at school and district levels.

828
02:01:42,512 --> 02:01:48,377
A monthly review of the action plans will take place to ensure that we are moving forward productively.

829
02:01:49,978 --> 02:02:02,568
Our second initiative is to prioritize development of systems that support a shared vision for disability awareness, anti-racism, anti-bias, and cultural proficiency across the school district.

830
02:02:03,427 --> 02:02:25,054
There are five anticipated outcomes of this initiative, which include emergence of an increasingly diverse staff, culturally proficient curriculum for all students, assessment of the state of our district with regard to diversity, district-wide disability awareness curriculum, and social justice curriculum for secondary education.

831
02:02:26,278 --> 02:02:32,679
When we think about and speak about diversity, our district vision encompasses numerous stakeholders.

832
02:02:33,179 --> 02:02:40,040
We are working toward building a community that sees diversity as a strength, while also recognizing that bias is real.

833
02:02:40,941 --> 02:02:45,461
We are considering many groups of people who are at risk of being marginalized.

834
02:02:46,002 --> 02:02:53,983
This includes people of color, people with disabilities, students of various religious, cultural, linguistic backgrounds, and more.

835
02:02:54,983 --> 02:02:59,967
I would like to also point out that for many individuals, they are a member of more than one of these groups.

836
02:03:01,328 --> 02:03:04,390
I would like to highlight two action items from this initiative.

837
02:03:04,910 --> 02:03:07,052
First, our racial equity task force.

838
02:03:07,872 --> 02:03:17,179
This group of community members, parents, caregivers, teachers, and administrators is focused on implementing a means by which to diversify staff.

839
02:03:18,280 --> 02:03:25,164
In addition, the racial equity task force is focused on assessing the district's cultural proficiency through an equity audit.

840
02:03:26,925 --> 02:03:28,105
That is being done this fall.

841
02:03:28,746 --> 02:03:39,051
The results of this audit will provide us with information that will help us incorporate information into this living document, our strategic plan, so that we can move forward productively.

842
02:03:39,931 --> 02:03:46,695
Also, I would like to briefly touch upon expanding our disability awareness curriculum, something that was also mentioned by our CPAC here tonight.

843
02:03:47,346 --> 02:03:53,109
This will include further professional development so that we can reach more staff.

844
02:03:53,710 --> 02:04:00,894
In addition, we are piloting disability awareness at the kindergarten, first grade, and high school levels this coming school year.

845
02:04:03,055 --> 02:04:03,816
Initiative three.

846
02:04:04,636 --> 02:04:10,100
Initiative three states provide equal access to academic support and enrichment.

847
02:04:11,320 --> 02:04:15,743
The anticipated outcomes are to define and adopt MTSSE.

848
02:04:16,472 --> 02:04:21,555
For reference, MTSS stands for multi-tiered systems of support.

849
02:04:22,555 --> 02:04:31,019
It's a well-known framework for how school districts can build necessary systems to ensure that each student receives a high quality educational experience.

850
02:04:31,940 --> 02:04:37,383
Under Dr. Edward Vincent's guidance, our task force added an E to MTSS.

851
02:04:37,983 --> 02:04:40,524
The E represents enrichment.

852
02:04:40,984 --> 02:04:45,787
We understand that enrichment is a vital component in meeting all of our students' needs.

853
02:04:46,763 --> 02:04:49,265
There are four anticipated outcomes of this initiative.

854
02:04:49,505 --> 02:04:50,105
Oh, excuse me.

855
02:04:50,285 --> 02:04:50,505
Hang on.

856
02:04:50,526 --> 02:04:52,447
Let me go back and tell you the anticipated outcomes.

857
02:04:53,207 --> 02:05:02,413
We will establish common practices, procedures, and terminology for screening, assessment, data collection, analysis, and focused evidence-based intervention.

858
02:05:03,094 --> 02:05:08,377
We will expand a library of special education assessments, and we will have extended day opportunities.

859
02:05:09,498 --> 02:05:13,781
One action item within this initiative relates to the Massachusetts Dyslexia Guidelines.

860
02:05:14,556 --> 02:05:30,608
To analyze this guidance, we are forming a team to review the guidelines, review Medford's current level of compliance with recommendations made in the Massachusetts Dyslexia Guidelines, and develop, begin implementation of an action plan that will target items from this guidance.

861
02:05:31,749 --> 02:05:36,192
Initiative four, ensure positive school culture.

862
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:51,972
has three anticipated outcomes, demonstrated improvement of school culture based on data collection, responsive classroom implementation at elementary level district wide, and restorative justice implementation at the secondary level district wide.

863
02:05:52,830 --> 02:06:00,196
Numerous stakeholders also weighed in on this objective and the initiatives.

864
02:06:00,657 --> 02:06:09,344
We considered various developmental levels, thinking about preschool all the way through high school and how to create the most positive school culture all the way through.

865
02:06:10,585 --> 02:06:16,430
One of our specific initiatives speaks to promoting positive school culture by developing a culture climate action plan.

866
02:06:17,415 --> 02:06:24,577
When we think about a positive school culture, we're also thinking about building a community that sees diversity as a strength, as we mentioned previously.

867
02:06:25,538 --> 02:06:29,279
These practices work in tandem and we remain inclusive in our thinking.

868
02:06:30,039 --> 02:06:43,304
For example, enrichment opportunities are an excellent occasion for students to learn about cultural experiences, seeking out a diverse group of professionals to present to middle school and high school students about career paths,

869
02:06:44,047 --> 02:06:47,269
helps to break down stereotypes and gives all students a model.

870
02:06:48,189 --> 02:06:52,852
For clarity, when we say diverse, this encompasses all types of diversity.

871
02:06:53,373 --> 02:07:00,156
We're talking about racial, cultural, linguistic, disability, LGBTQIA+, et cetera.

872
02:07:00,777 --> 02:07:09,142
Seeing students who look like you or sound like you or have had similar life experiences achieve great things has a powerful influence on our students.

873
02:07:10,222 --> 02:07:11,083
Initiative five,

874
02:07:11,618 --> 02:07:17,744
The final initiative under equitable learning environments is to recruit retain and develop a diverse staff.

875
02:07:19,126 --> 02:07:27,254
The anticipated outcomes of this initiative are to cultivate a diverse workforce and increase retention rates for all new employees.

876
02:07:28,654 --> 02:07:45,941
One of the specific actions included in this work is to expand our human resources recruiting activities to fill all positions and develop more diversity through using memberships in the New England Minority Network and the Massachusetts Partnership for Diversity to facilitate this goal.

877
02:07:46,922 --> 02:07:52,004
To highlight and understand why this is so important, we need to consider our current teaching workforce.

878
02:07:52,924 --> 02:07:57,206
Based on information from our human resources office and DESE data,

879
02:07:58,008 --> 02:08:01,811
1% of our teachers are Hispanic, while 13.5% of our students are Hispanic.

880
02:08:01,831 --> 02:08:05,734
0.41% of our teachers are Black, compared with 11.9% of our students.

881
02:08:05,754 --> 02:08:09,177
And 1.9% of our students are Asian, while 9.5% of our students are Asian.

882
02:08:21,328 --> 02:08:27,732
The district is committed to increasing diversity of our workforce so that it better represents our student body.

883
02:08:28,833 --> 02:08:34,056
In closing, as you have heard, equity is a large umbrella under which many key initiatives reside.

884
02:08:34,617 --> 02:08:34,897
Thank you.

885
02:08:34,937 --> 02:08:36,538
I'll turn it over to Dr. Edward-Linson.

886
02:08:39,720 --> 02:08:40,220
Thank you.

887
02:08:43,363 --> 02:08:45,324
So our fourth bucket is support.

888
02:08:47,709 --> 02:08:59,618
And in that area of support, we're going to assess, review and ensure a safe and secure teaching and learning environment.

889
02:09:01,640 --> 02:09:08,045
Our first initiative under support is maintain and evaluate safety protocols.

890
02:09:10,787 --> 02:09:15,090
Anticipated outcomes, comprehensive safety procedures book.

891
02:09:16,165 --> 02:09:28,035
examples of letters for principles, creation of commonly used statements translated, equity and safety for all of our students and staff.

892
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:36,522
One key initiative which was mentioned

893
02:09:37,002 --> 02:10:02,498
was making sure to compile all of the safety plans for all of the schools at the start of every school year, which is something that we normally do, but to also make it a point to train staff or new staff on the necessary procedures to follow in the event of an emergency, as well as the drill and practice that we do have normally with students, such as in a fire drill.

894
02:10:04,495 --> 02:10:12,140
Our second initiative under support is to build and sustain partnerships with community organizations.

895
02:10:12,821 --> 02:10:15,643
Some of our anticipated outcomes are as follows.

896
02:10:16,603 --> 02:10:27,591
The PALS involvement district-wide, district-level Mustang Way culture, promoting that, an annual report by community stakeholder team,

897
02:10:28,988 --> 02:10:44,812
data consistent, data indicating consistent consideration for individualized emergency response plan, IER needs, and consistent monthly meetings with public safety stakeholders.

898
02:10:46,552 --> 02:10:57,435
And under initiative number two, where we talk about this consistent consideration of individualized emergency response plans,

899
02:10:58,485 --> 02:11:21,782
These IERs are developed in collaboration with our universal safety committee and CPAC, which presented earlier in consideration of this need during an IEP or 504 meetings and at any time an individual has a change in status, be it mental, physical, communicative, health, et cetera.

900
02:11:22,282 --> 02:11:27,746
And so that is a specific action item that we would like to be paying special attention to

901
02:11:28,323 --> 02:11:29,584
to provide support.

902
02:11:31,145 --> 02:11:42,031
Under our third bucket, S3 support, strategically utilize our finances to improve learning environments.

903
02:11:42,671 --> 02:11:51,056
And some of those anticipated outcomes would be completion of a comprehensive and annualized capital improvement process and inventory.

904
02:11:52,376 --> 02:11:54,998
Ongoing dialogue with the municipal government

905
02:11:55,478 --> 02:12:01,021
and MSBA regarding critical infrastructure priorities across the district.

906
02:12:01,962 --> 02:12:14,170
And again, a key initiative under S3 would be assembling a global manual to dictate yearly maintenance systems.

907
02:12:14,810 --> 02:12:17,932
For example, our filter replacements and air testing.

908
02:12:18,763 --> 02:12:23,464
Having gone through this year, we learned a lot from the pandemic and we had to learn under duress.

909
02:12:24,364 --> 02:12:28,646
And we really felt at one point where we were behind the eight ball.

910
02:12:29,246 --> 02:12:46,090
So we are working on having a detailed timeline and inventory of all yearly maintenance routines, including summer schedules and air quality systems, which are critically important to maintain the safety and health of all individuals.

911
02:12:46,846 --> 02:12:55,214
And so that is our goal to have that completed by September, this coming September, September of 21.

912
02:12:57,095 --> 02:13:05,303
So this is just a brief overview of what our district strategy for improvement contains.

913
02:13:05,932 --> 02:13:09,913
And I want the committee to know that this is a living document.

914
02:13:10,394 --> 02:13:11,874
It's not a static document.

915
02:13:12,134 --> 02:13:13,375
We will be able to add.

916
02:13:13,875 --> 02:13:15,295
We will be able to update.

917
02:13:16,116 --> 02:13:24,819
And we did commit in our communications subcommittee to present an update to the entire committee

918
02:13:26,465 --> 02:13:35,908
you know, on a yearly basis in terms of things that have been added or things that have been deleted or things that have been accomplished so that we can put a check next to the box.

919
02:13:36,488 --> 02:13:41,750
So I'm very proud of this district strategy for improvement.

920
02:13:41,790 --> 02:13:52,533
I'm very appreciative of the collaborative nature in which it was created to really document and show the committee, the community, all staff and students,

921
02:13:53,298 --> 02:14:06,947
what is medford public schools strategy for improvement and that is it's clearly detailed in the four buckets of aces but also achievement collaboration equity and support.

922
02:14:07,428 --> 02:14:07,868
thank you.

923
02:14:10,750 --> 02:14:11,771
thank you for the presentation.

924
02:14:11,791 --> 02:14:16,914
member russell, member mclaughlin and then member kretz.

925
02:14:17,935 --> 02:14:18,656
thank you mayor.

926
02:14:18,716 --> 02:14:19,996
thank you for the presentation.

927
02:14:20,016 --> 02:14:22,218
i'm not far enough forward am i?

928
02:14:25,876 --> 02:14:27,438
So a couple of things.

929
02:14:28,098 --> 02:14:41,027
First off, if we could have this added to policy CMA, which is our annual reports and presentation schedule, I make a motion to add it to the schedule as an annual presentation.

930
02:14:41,348 --> 02:14:41,788
Second.

931
02:14:45,110 --> 02:14:48,373
And then I'll just go through those things quickly.

932
02:14:48,993 --> 02:14:54,017
Also in that policy that we passed in February of this year, I believe,

933
02:14:54,780 --> 02:14:59,103
We do have a reference to a definitions page that we were going to set up.

934
02:14:59,163 --> 02:15:01,165
And I realize there's a lot of things going on.

935
02:15:01,185 --> 02:15:07,490
I would just urge us to have a single glossary or like a mandatory glossary.

936
02:15:07,530 --> 02:15:12,794
The superintendent says nobody gets to create their own because, you know, we have definition pages here.

937
02:15:12,814 --> 02:15:23,722
We're going to have a glossary in this document and, you know, definitions drift and change and maintenance is a nightmare when everybody has their own copy of what the definitions are.

938
02:15:24,548 --> 02:15:41,977
And I just, not a motion, just I would urge us to create this actual webpage on our website and then put all those in there so that everybody has a consistent agreement as to when we say, what's a 504, the explanation I saw in the presentation looked good.

939
02:15:43,118 --> 02:15:52,163
No, okay, see, well, I'm not the expert on that, but somebody else can probably come up with a really great definition

940
02:15:52,805 --> 02:15:56,306
But if you ask me, I'll probably give you a pretty hacked version.

941
02:15:57,226 --> 02:15:58,146
So that would be nice.

942
02:15:58,766 --> 02:16:05,728
And then on an equity initiative, E3, there's the word equal.

943
02:16:05,768 --> 02:16:12,249
And it's one of those things where I'm not sure in the sentence what is being said.

944
02:16:12,289 --> 02:16:16,350
It says, provide equal access to academic support and enrichment.

945
02:16:20,312 --> 02:16:23,214
the two completely different ways of viewing that sentence.

946
02:16:23,754 --> 02:16:28,897
An equal access, for instance, would be to provide an enrichment activity with a $500 fee.

947
02:16:29,318 --> 02:16:32,660
Anybody who wants to can pay the fee, that's equal.

948
02:16:34,341 --> 02:16:36,482
And I don't think that was the goal.

949
02:16:38,103 --> 02:16:45,588
Equal access presumably would mean anybody who wants to participate can participate in the enrichment activity, whether or not you can afford it or not.

950
02:16:46,289 --> 02:16:49,891
And so I just, I don't know that

951
02:16:50,507 --> 02:16:52,128
equal isn't the right word.

952
02:16:52,648 --> 02:16:58,392
I just feel like there needs to be a little bit more meat behind that word to make it clear when we say equal access.

953
02:17:00,494 --> 02:17:08,499
It's sort of been the big problem for a long time is we offer all these things to anybody who wants them.

954
02:17:08,579 --> 02:17:15,284
There's all these opportunities with no consideration as to whether or not they are actually accessible to individual students.

955
02:17:15,704 --> 02:17:17,645
I'm preaching to the choir here a bit.

956
02:17:19,219 --> 02:17:27,281
When I saw that, I just got a little bit concerned that when we say that, we mean we're gonna offer a whole bunch of activities, maybe they cost money, maybe they don't.

957
02:17:27,981 --> 02:17:35,903
And the fact that we offer them is in fact equal, like anybody can participate if you can find the money.

958
02:17:36,843 --> 02:17:45,565
And that isn't really what I think the intent of that, being on the equity initiative, to me, I read that very,

959
02:17:46,195 --> 02:17:47,196
is a confusing state.

960
02:17:47,236 --> 02:17:48,717
And you said you were on E3.

961
02:17:48,757 --> 02:17:50,838
I'm just trying to find the specific one.

962
02:17:50,858 --> 02:17:53,600
The Equity Initiative E3.

963
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:57,002
And maybe there were more E3s.

964
02:17:57,142 --> 02:18:03,546
But if you can just find a way to word it or add an asterisk, I don't know what the right way to do that.

965
02:18:03,686 --> 02:18:13,632
But when we look at the outcomes later on, we say anybody who wants to go on the middle school field trip can go.

966
02:18:13,652 --> 02:18:15,853
But that's not true.

967
02:18:17,183 --> 02:18:21,945
because we charge a pile of money and so not everybody can go.

968
02:18:22,965 --> 02:18:34,849
So I like the definition of equal where it's sort of an individual, every individual student has the access and that's gonna look different for every student.

969
02:18:36,010 --> 02:18:38,991
So other than that, I thought it was really nice.

970
02:18:39,631 --> 02:18:39,931
Thank you.

971
02:18:39,951 --> 02:18:44,673
I appreciated the details and I know that it's a much bigger presentation, but we can't be here all night.

972
02:18:45,053 --> 02:18:45,313
Thank you.

973
02:18:49,160 --> 02:18:51,901
Member McLaughlin, then Kretz, then Member Van de Kloot.

974
02:18:52,321 --> 02:18:54,002
Mayor, we had a motion on the floor with a second.

975
02:18:54,022 --> 02:18:56,723
Did we want to do that before I speak?

976
02:18:57,484 --> 02:18:58,444
I was just keeping note of it.

977
02:18:58,764 --> 02:18:59,304
OK, that's right.

978
02:18:59,344 --> 02:18:59,905
Thank you.

979
02:18:59,925 --> 02:19:00,285
I just.

980
02:19:00,685 --> 02:19:00,965
Thank you.

981
02:19:19,480 --> 02:19:21,420
Okay, your microphone wasn't on.

982
02:19:21,521 --> 02:19:28,122
So we're not broadcasting in West Medford, but we're on YouTube and online.

983
02:19:28,142 --> 02:19:28,942
Okay.

984
02:19:30,023 --> 02:19:30,303
Thank you.

985
02:19:31,843 --> 02:19:33,383
Thank you for the report.

986
02:19:34,504 --> 02:19:41,925
And for the plan, it's really great to see it broken down into both the acronym and the initiatives and their relative, you know, prefix and the initiatives.

987
02:19:41,986 --> 02:19:44,406
And I especially appreciate the glossary.

988
02:19:44,526 --> 02:19:47,887
And I too would just encourage folks to consider

989
02:19:48,708 --> 02:19:52,991
the definitions and to consult with our experts in the community on the definition.

990
02:19:53,111 --> 02:20:02,178
So, for example, the definition of a 504, I would ask that respectfully that we talk with, you know, Dr. Hollenbeck or Ms.

991
02:20:02,198 --> 02:20:10,724
Bowen around strength based language is really sort of, you know, what we want to, what I would recommend using.

992
02:20:10,744 --> 02:20:10,804
And

993
02:20:14,409 --> 02:20:36,904
to member, through the chair, to member Russo's point around equity, I always think of sort of equity versus equality, and this is not from me, this is a quote from someone else who I'm sorry, I can't credit right now, because I'm not sure who, but it's, you know, equity is not that everyone gets the same, it's that everyone gets what they need, as opposed to equal, in which everyone gets the same.

994
02:20:37,464 --> 02:20:41,967
So I just really like that sort of a definition, but I also appreciate having the definitions

995
02:20:42,512 --> 02:20:50,596
be universal and be across districts so that we're all under the same understanding when we hear these different words or acronyms or what have you.

996
02:20:50,776 --> 02:20:57,699
So with that, I actually also wanted to put a motion on the floor, but I don't know that I can do that if there's one on four hours, so I'll wait.

997
02:20:58,099 --> 02:21:00,120
Motion to approve, but I will wait.

998
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:05,482
Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent and everyone on the tactical team and within the district for all your hard work.

999
02:21:05,502 --> 02:21:06,122
Appreciate it.

1000
02:21:08,683 --> 02:21:08,983
Thank you.

1001
02:21:09,084 --> 02:21:10,024
Member Kretz?

1002
02:21:10,615 --> 02:21:22,302
Yes, I wanted to say, first off, I wanted to say thank you very much for all the input and collaboration with the administrators and everybody involved with this together.

1003
02:21:23,243 --> 02:21:36,871
We had a really good discussion at the subcommittee meeting, and I really enjoyed getting to participate in the poll and choosing the new design and the look of the new strategic plan.

1004
02:21:36,911 --> 02:21:37,692
It looks excellent.

1005
02:21:38,255 --> 02:21:40,316
And it's just, it's so user-friendly.

1006
02:21:40,336 --> 02:21:42,416
You can click on the link, you just get right in.

1007
02:21:42,556 --> 02:21:44,417
It's just, it's really great.

1008
02:21:44,717 --> 02:21:46,558
And I too really liked the glossary.

1009
02:21:46,578 --> 02:21:50,559
I think it's really helpful and I'm so glad that that's part of it also.

1010
02:21:50,659 --> 02:21:56,901
And I just wanted to say thank you for all the time and efforts from everybody on this plan.

1011
02:21:57,441 --> 02:21:58,661
It just came out really great.

1012
02:21:59,102 --> 02:21:59,542
Thank you.

1013
02:22:00,382 --> 02:22:00,742
Thank you.

1014
02:22:01,502 --> 02:22:02,222
Thank you, Member Kretz.

1015
02:22:03,243 --> 02:22:03,783
Member Van de Kloof.

1016
02:22:04,540 --> 02:22:06,121
Yes, I just want to add my word.

1017
02:22:06,441 --> 02:22:08,423
This is clearly a very comprehensive plan.

1018
02:22:09,023 --> 02:22:19,210
As we were, as you were presenting it, I was looking at all the different things that we've talked about this evening and in our other meetings and sort of thinking about which buckets they would go into.

1019
02:22:20,411 --> 02:22:31,658
It's not that some of those things haven't been already been doing, but the laying it out and saying this is our direction certainly makes it very clear to everybody.

1020
02:22:32,395 --> 02:22:35,237
.

1021
02:22:32,455 --> 02:22:35,237
So thank you for all the work that everybody put into this.

1022
02:22:35,257 --> 02:22:37,197
Thank you.

1023
02:22:37,217 --> 02:22:38,098
Thank you, member van de gloot.

1024
02:22:38,138 --> 02:22:41,139
Member graham?

1025
02:22:41,399 --> 02:22:53,325
Just one final note that this is substantially different than what we saw in February before the pandemic sort of upended everything.

1026
02:22:53,385 --> 02:23:01,069
I just want to point out for the listening audience that all of this work was a tremendous amount of effort and it happened

1027
02:23:01,774 --> 02:23:15,178
while we were fixing many years of deferred maintenance, while we were getting kids back to school, while we were building a best in state testing program, while we were keeping kids in school and not sick.

1028
02:23:15,758 --> 02:23:19,320
So this is like a year's worth of work on its own.

1029
02:23:19,340 --> 02:23:26,302
And instead you all did it, you know, with just a few other things going on.

1030
02:23:26,382 --> 02:23:30,363
So I'm really appreciative and I can't underscore how much work this was, so thank you.

1031
02:23:31,690 --> 02:23:32,230
I second that.

1032
02:23:34,592 --> 02:23:35,273
Me a third then.

1033
02:23:37,075 --> 02:23:37,495
Great work.

1034
02:23:38,436 --> 02:23:41,118
Number eight, report on the business services.

1035
02:23:42,519 --> 02:23:43,580
Oh, yes, that's right.

1036
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:49,385
Motion to add this to the annual presentation list by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin.

1037
02:23:49,705 --> 02:23:50,366
All in favor?

1038
02:23:50,726 --> 02:23:50,846
Aye.

1039
02:23:51,106 --> 02:23:51,787
All opposed?

1040
02:23:52,327 --> 02:23:53,068
Motion passes.

1041
02:23:53,208 --> 02:23:58,112
Can I make a motion to approve the recommendation?

1042
02:23:58,657 --> 02:23:59,857
of the NPS strategic plan.

1043
02:24:00,057 --> 02:24:03,879
Motion to approve the recommendation by member Glossman, seconded by member Van de Kloot.

1044
02:24:04,179 --> 02:24:04,719
All in favor?

1045
02:24:05,299 --> 02:24:05,419
Aye.

1046
02:24:05,579 --> 02:24:06,139
All opposed?

1047
02:24:07,099 --> 02:24:07,780
Motion passes.

1048
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:19,003
Now number eight, report on the business services audit of the Metropublic Schools by the Management Solution, TMS, Mr. Andrew Parkett and Mr. David Murphy.

1049
02:24:27,383 --> 02:24:29,745
Hold on, Mr. Murphy, let me just get your microphone on, sorry.

1050
02:24:34,928 --> 02:24:35,869
All set, sorry about that.

1051
02:24:36,089 --> 02:24:36,569
Thank you, Mayor.

1052
02:24:37,250 --> 02:24:49,558
So as I was saying, Mr. Brockett, the President and CEO of the Management Solution is watching tonight and his members of his staff are present, those members of his staff who actually worked on this report.

1053
02:24:49,618 --> 02:24:55,362
And I just wanted to give a very brief introduction to remind members of the community and the committee how the district came

1054
02:24:56,023 --> 02:24:58,785
to be in partnership with TMS.

1055
02:24:58,945 --> 02:25:12,276
During the interim period between myself and my predecessor as the district CFO, the school committee retained the services of Mr. Paquette and his firm to serve as the interim business administrator for the school district.

1056
02:25:12,636 --> 02:25:23,465
And then from the point in time from my appointment until the present, we've retained Mr. Paquette as a consultant working with us both in the development of the report that's before you tonight,

1057
02:25:24,169 --> 02:25:42,214
auditing the business services operations of the district, as well as providing us counsel on various matters ranging from some labor relations issues to our end of year report and responding to various audits that we are responsible for responding to as a school district.

1058
02:25:42,274 --> 02:25:53,537
So before I introduce Mr. Himmelberger and Dr. Kuhl, who are here to speak on behalf of the Management Solution, I did just want to say that for both Mr. Kingdon in my office and myself,

1059
02:25:54,087 --> 02:25:57,530
Mr. Parkett and his team have been an invaluable resource.

1060
02:25:57,930 --> 02:26:05,295
The breadth of knowledge that they bring to issues related to school finance, procurement, and other matters that come before us has been extremely helpful.

1061
02:26:05,976 --> 02:26:13,000
It influenced our inclusion of contractual services line in the budget that we presented to you last month.

1062
02:26:14,001 --> 02:26:17,824
And the report before you, I think, spells out some key

1063
02:26:18,337 --> 02:26:27,141
recommendations with regard to improving the district's financial practices, some of which I'm happy to say we have either implemented or are in the process of implementing.

1064
02:26:27,781 --> 02:26:30,802
This has really been sort of a year-long relationship that we've benefited from.

1065
02:26:31,402 --> 02:26:41,046
And so I'm going to defer to Mr. Parkett's staff to walk us through some of the specific recommendations in the report, and I'll be happy to take any questions you might have as to where we are with respect to implementation.

1066
02:26:41,106 --> 02:26:42,067
So thank you.

1067
02:26:42,107 --> 02:26:46,969
At this time, I'll turn it over to Dr. Judy Hould, CFO of the Management Solution

1068
02:26:47,788 --> 02:26:51,690
Mr. Allen Himmelberg, our Senior School Business Administrator for TMS.

1069
02:26:51,750 --> 02:26:52,050
Thank you.

1070
02:26:53,071 --> 02:26:54,052
Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

1071
02:26:54,912 --> 02:26:55,272
Welcome.

1072
02:26:58,714 --> 02:26:59,215
Good evening.

1073
02:27:00,175 --> 02:27:05,198
We're pleased to be here this evening on behalf of TMS to present this report to you.

1074
02:27:06,579 --> 02:27:07,399
I'm Judy Hull.

1075
02:27:07,580 --> 02:27:15,344
I am the Senior Vice President and Chief Education Officer for TMS, and I've been in this business for over 40 years.

1076
02:27:15,784 --> 02:27:16,805
It's a hard number to say.

1077
02:27:18,176 --> 02:27:22,038
But I have been a teacher of students from grades three through adults.

1078
02:27:22,519 --> 02:27:23,880
I've been a curriculum director.

1079
02:27:24,020 --> 02:27:27,362
I've been a business administrator and I've been a superintendent of schools.

1080
02:27:27,462 --> 02:27:31,465
So I've been in most places that education happens.

1081
02:27:31,545 --> 02:27:38,550
So it's nice to be on this side of it and to be able to be a resource to districts as they try to move forward.

1082
02:27:38,970 --> 02:27:41,431
Alan, I'll let you take the next side of honors.

1083
02:27:41,451 --> 02:27:41,992
Thank you, Judy.

1084
02:27:42,072 --> 02:27:42,612
Thank you, Mayor.

1085
02:27:43,633 --> 02:27:46,475
Great to be here as a former school committee member.

1086
02:27:47,468 --> 02:27:48,629
and school committee chair.

1087
02:27:48,689 --> 02:27:50,150
It's very fitting.

1088
02:27:50,230 --> 02:27:53,913
My first night out in a long time is at a school committee.

1089
02:27:54,754 --> 02:28:01,820
So I have been very fortunate in my career to be a superintendent.

1090
02:28:02,420 --> 02:28:06,304
I have been a executive director of a collaborative.

1091
02:28:07,084 --> 02:28:12,168
I have chaired a couple of building committees and built schools and renovated schools.

1092
02:28:13,029 --> 02:28:16,492
And it has really

1093
02:28:17,310 --> 02:28:24,833
been an amazing journey to be able to empathize with all that you guys do on a daily basis.

1094
02:28:25,593 --> 02:28:28,034
And so here we go.

1095
02:28:31,095 --> 02:28:36,777
So the methodology that we used, and I wanted to just clarify, it's really not an audit.

1096
02:28:37,018 --> 02:28:42,400
It's really an operational review that we were tasked with by the committee to do.

1097
02:28:44,415 --> 02:28:52,718
We did structured interviews all on Zoom, which was very challenging.

1098
02:28:54,258 --> 02:29:00,941
And we talked with tremendous number of staff throughout the district.

1099
02:29:01,661 --> 02:29:07,903
The two areas that we focused on and were asked to focus on were budget development and financial management.

1100
02:29:11,228 --> 02:29:14,069
So the report is broken into two parts.

1101
02:29:14,569 --> 02:29:15,769
The first part is the findings.

1102
02:29:15,949 --> 02:29:20,490
And basically what we did was we combed through the data from the interviews.

1103
02:29:21,030 --> 02:29:30,512
One of us asked the question while the other was the note taker so that we could each focus on our relative tasks around facilitation and note taking to make sure we captured everything.

1104
02:29:30,852 --> 02:29:35,612
And then we looked for common themes that came across from either all or most of the interviews.

1105
02:29:36,073 --> 02:29:38,333
And so that's what you have in the findings piece of this.

1106
02:29:38,857 --> 02:29:45,360
And then the second piece of the report is a set of recommendations around budget development and financial management.

1107
02:29:45,900 --> 02:29:53,163
And these recommendations really stem from state and national organizations as well as TMS's own best practices.

1108
02:29:53,683 --> 02:29:59,285
We have worked in several districts across the Commonwealth and collaboratives as well.

1109
02:29:59,725 --> 02:30:07,609
And so we have learned along the way about what our best practices and how we can make those real for our clients.

1110
02:30:09,050 --> 02:30:11,372
That's where the recommendations stem from.

1111
02:30:11,392 --> 02:30:15,255
So we're gonna start with the findings first.

1112
02:30:16,496 --> 02:30:21,821
And let's talk a little bit about the budget development themes.

1113
02:30:21,981 --> 02:30:27,005
And these were things that were common recurring themes in the interviews that we did with folks.

1114
02:30:27,045 --> 02:30:33,691
And we interviewed about 20 staff members, both on the city side as well as school side and superintendent as well.

1115
02:30:33,771 --> 02:30:36,213
So these are where the themes came along.

1116
02:30:37,688 --> 02:30:56,078
One of the themes that came out in our discussions with folks was that the timeline for putting the budget together seemed to be too late for the kind of presentation, preparation, discussion, and revision that's necessary to put a comprehensive budget together.

1117
02:30:56,098 --> 02:31:02,080
And I think when we get to the recommendations, you'll see why we came to the conclusions we did about that.

1118
02:31:03,853 --> 02:31:12,836
people also felt that prior to the current administration, that there was a lack of input and advocacy for student needs across that.

1119
02:31:13,056 --> 02:31:27,981
They have also reported to us that the current administration is beginning to change that work in the way the budget is developed so that there is input and there is the opportunity to have some advocacy for student needs in the process.

1120
02:31:28,941 --> 02:31:31,762
So I think that's an optimistic sign.

1121
02:31:32,912 --> 02:31:44,962
The other part of the data told us that also because of some high turnover in administrative positions, that some of the history of requests along the way got lost in the shuffle.

1122
02:31:45,042 --> 02:31:57,352
So again, just hopeful that the current administration, as things gel and come together and you have some longevity together, that you're gonna be able to really have some good budget history on which to build.

1123
02:31:57,612 --> 02:32:01,415
And so people really in the interviews seem very optimistic

1124
02:32:01,997 --> 02:32:05,519
about what the future holds for the budget development process.

1125
02:32:07,740 --> 02:32:10,741
And I'll let Alan speak to the financial management themes.

1126
02:32:11,341 --> 02:32:20,645
And again, to Judy's point, we conducted these interviews late September through January, with the bulk of them in October and November.

1127
02:32:21,165 --> 02:32:25,567
So a lot of things, I'm sure, have changed for the better.

1128
02:32:29,828 --> 02:32:49,082
biggest issues of concern that were universal was the lack of a financial software system that was able to integrate across the city side, the school side, so that everyone would be able to access the same data at the same time.

1129
02:32:50,903 --> 02:32:59,449
The lack of reporting, the challenge to manage multiple systems along with admins, you have

1130
02:33:00,232 --> 02:33:17,744
front line, you have ASAP, you have Harper's, and then many, several departments were using Excel and Adobe to try and keep up and then check in with what they did get from other systems.

1131
02:33:18,384 --> 02:33:29,071
So that was universal from everybody that we spoke to, that the challenges of using the current system really

1132
02:33:29,521 --> 02:33:34,885
rippled across the efficiency and the effectiveness of staff.

1133
02:33:38,027 --> 02:33:42,210
The payroll, as it was presented, was not encumbered.

1134
02:33:42,750 --> 02:33:49,815
And payroll can be 60, 70, maybe a little higher percent on your total school budget.

1135
02:33:50,616 --> 02:33:54,919
And to not have a system that could encumber the dollars necessary

1136
02:33:55,524 --> 02:34:01,405
is again to the point that the best practices are that you must encumber payroll.

1137
02:34:02,185 --> 02:34:11,107
The other thing that was amazing to find out was that step and lane changes were done on a manual calculation.

1138
02:34:12,147 --> 02:34:19,048
And that is a mathematical task that is just hard to fathom.

1139
02:34:19,788 --> 02:34:23,709
And so to be able to then catch any mistakes

1140
02:34:24,297 --> 02:34:28,559
Sometimes it was the middle of the year before you were able to recalculate and to reassess.

1141
02:34:29,179 --> 02:34:46,567
So being able to get a system that can manage your payroll and to allow you to encumber it and then be able to plug in your steps and lanes and have instant calculations, which are then accurate and speak again to the efficient use of time.

1142
02:34:49,708 --> 02:34:51,289
Mayor, may I just ask a point of information?

1143
02:34:53,437 --> 02:34:54,958
Member McLaughlin, point of information.

1144
02:34:55,298 --> 02:34:58,380
Just if you could clarify what encumbered means for the community, please.

1145
02:34:58,580 --> 02:34:58,880
Sure.

1146
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:13,487
So when in most budgets, depending upon how you do your cash account, the payroll is allocated, but it's not really booked against your budget.

1147
02:35:14,088 --> 02:35:22,612
School districts, because of the complexity of the payroll and multitude of contracts, different types of staff being paid,

1148
02:35:24,140 --> 02:35:42,645
It's incumbent, it's integral to make sure that you can take the dollars that you project to spend and put the fence around them so those dollars are still there as you go through the year to pay everybody, whether it's on a 21 or a 26 pay or a balloon payment over the summer.

1149
02:35:43,105 --> 02:35:48,186
That way, you don't have any issues with compensation.

1150
02:35:49,286 --> 02:35:52,967
It really nips a lot of potential issues in the bud.

1151
02:35:53,772 --> 02:36:00,673
if you can encumber, set aside all of the funds necessary to pay people throughout the year.

1152
02:36:01,334 --> 02:36:05,214
Yeah, and it also gives an opportunity for people to see what's left.

1153
02:36:06,755 --> 02:36:21,618
What you pay, what you need to pay, and then what the net is that's left allows you to really calculate and track the budget in a way that makes some sense and to be able to have a software package that can do that for you versus manual calculations

1154
02:36:22,249 --> 02:36:25,452
is certainly gonna be a much more efficient way to be able to do that work.

1155
02:36:26,673 --> 02:36:26,893
Mayor.

1156
02:36:27,774 --> 02:36:30,516
Member Russo.

1157
02:36:32,458 --> 02:36:36,161
Mr. Murphy may be able to answer this, and you actually probably can too.

1158
02:36:36,721 --> 02:36:41,745
So I've been constantly trying to get a burn report, like how much have we used of the amount?

1159
02:36:41,925 --> 02:36:50,913
And it's apparently like a nice request, but without this kind of a system, it's really a huge ask.

1160
02:36:51,397 --> 02:36:52,697
It should be a click of a button.

1161
02:36:53,478 --> 02:36:53,938
Exactly.

1162
02:36:54,078 --> 02:36:54,498
Correct.

1163
02:36:54,558 --> 02:37:03,641
And it's not only a big ask, it's, again, speaking to the time it would take to do a back-of-the-envelope calculation as you go through the year.

1164
02:37:03,661 --> 02:37:14,264
At most school committees I have been on, you would like to get the reports as to where you are as you go through the year.

1165
02:37:14,924 --> 02:37:20,386
Many school committees do quarterly reporting so you know exactly where you are.

1166
02:37:21,184 --> 02:37:29,308
and to do it with multiple systems that don't integrate across a single platform is really, really challenging.

1167
02:37:31,370 --> 02:37:38,313
Good point.

1168
02:37:40,575 --> 02:37:50,320
So the last one is the financial management themes that we've looked at was the approval process as you are

1169
02:37:51,195 --> 02:37:54,856
processing invoices can be lengthy.

1170
02:37:55,676 --> 02:37:59,317
They are sometimes not processed as quickly as needed.

1171
02:38:01,158 --> 02:38:13,521
I think it probably speaks to a couple of different issues, one being just the sheer volume and how do you prioritize when you don't have access to the same data all of the time.

1172
02:38:14,081 --> 02:38:20,943
And I think that that, again, for some vendors, you'll get them coming back to the

1173
02:38:21,438 --> 02:38:23,980
the school and city side to ask where the payment is.

1174
02:38:24,480 --> 02:38:31,705
Again, further extending the hours needed to do something that you shouldn't have to worry about.

1175
02:38:32,386 --> 02:38:35,548
So that was another one of the themes that kept recurring.

1176
02:38:35,768 --> 02:38:35,929
Right.

1177
02:38:36,449 --> 02:38:43,634
And some folks reported that the process for submitting purchase orders and tracking them was different from department to department.

1178
02:38:43,714 --> 02:38:48,778
Again, I think it's because you don't have, at the current moment, an accounting system that can

1179
02:38:49,698 --> 02:38:52,559
take you through that process in a way that is efficient.

1180
02:38:53,220 --> 02:38:56,681
So that was something else that came through in the data as well.

1181
02:38:57,322 --> 02:39:01,364
So those were sort of the major themes that came out of the interviews that we did.

1182
02:39:01,584 --> 02:39:03,805
And so we'll move on now to the recommendations.

1183
02:39:04,465 --> 02:39:07,107
And we'll begin with budget development.

1184
02:39:07,747 --> 02:39:09,528
And it's interesting to

1185
02:39:10,186 --> 02:39:18,488
see and hear that you have a new strategic plan because you stole our thunder a little bit, but that's okay.

1186
02:39:18,748 --> 02:39:19,148
Well done.

1187
02:39:19,648 --> 02:39:22,609
Yes, nice job superintendent, great job.

1188
02:39:23,449 --> 02:39:26,929
So we would recommend an expanded timeline.

1189
02:39:27,650 --> 02:39:33,991
Both of us in our positions as superintendent usually begin this process in November with our administrators.

1190
02:39:34,071 --> 02:39:39,092
We begin that process of looking at where it is that you want to go.

1191
02:39:40,176 --> 02:39:46,121
And aligning the document with your school improvement or your district strategic plan is critical.

1192
02:39:46,181 --> 02:39:47,822
They should fit like a glove.

1193
02:39:48,202 --> 02:39:53,286
You should not have one document over here and another document over here that don't speak to each other.

1194
02:39:53,666 --> 02:40:05,235
Because the only way you're going to be able to accomplish the ambitious goals you've just set for yourselves tonight is to make sure that they are resourced properly so that the things that you have committed to can happen.

1195
02:40:05,696 --> 02:40:08,778
And the only way to do that is to put those two things together.

1196
02:40:09,377 --> 02:40:16,805
So it requires the budget process to begin much earlier in the cycle in to begin November ish, give or take.

1197
02:40:17,285 --> 02:40:23,792
I used to with my principles tell them that their ticket to their December vacation was their budget requests in my hand.

1198
02:40:24,553 --> 02:40:28,017
You know that was often a way to kind of motivate to get the thing done.

1199
02:40:29,692 --> 02:40:31,113
And it's a collaborative process.

1200
02:40:31,193 --> 02:40:40,339
Now that you've got the roadmap in front of you, you really can begin doing a collaborative process on the budget and how all of the pieces impact each other.

1201
02:40:42,080 --> 02:40:44,461
It also allows for accountability in the budget cycle.

1202
02:40:45,342 --> 02:40:55,328
It's a term used in business world, it's called value chain analysis, but you measure the effectiveness of the resources with the metrics for success of goals.

1203
02:40:55,708 --> 02:40:58,290
So we heard repeatedly tonight looking at

1204
02:40:58,666 --> 02:41:10,195
improve student outcomes, and how you measure those student outcomes gives you a window on how the resources are being used to accomplish the goals that you've set for yourselves.

1205
02:41:10,556 --> 02:41:16,581
So it, in a way, puts in its own accountability system within the budget process as well.

1206
02:41:17,181 --> 02:41:24,147
Are the resources we are targeting towards these particular outcomes, are they making a difference?

1207
02:41:24,707 --> 02:41:25,648
And if they're not,

1208
02:41:26,638 --> 02:41:29,219
then how do we need to resource things differently?

1209
02:41:29,599 --> 02:41:34,262
So it's sort of this cyclical process that really keep asking those questions of yourselves.

1210
02:41:34,622 --> 02:41:36,743
Here are the goals we want to accomplish.

1211
02:41:36,783 --> 02:41:38,604
Here are the resources we're gonna put toward it.

1212
02:41:38,964 --> 02:41:41,425
Did we get where we wanted to go with the resources?

1213
02:41:41,825 --> 02:41:43,706
If we did, let's continue moving.

1214
02:41:44,006 --> 02:41:48,088
If we didn't, then we need to think differently about how we do resource allocation.

1215
02:41:48,548 --> 02:41:56,432
So that's all of sort of tonight's presentations kind of wrapped up in one tiny little package in terms of

1216
02:41:57,361 --> 02:41:59,002
how we put those things together.

1217
02:41:59,503 --> 02:42:05,166
And as we think about that, oftentimes people are looking to the business office for how to spend the funds.

1218
02:42:06,187 --> 02:42:07,528
We are not advocates of that.

1219
02:42:08,188 --> 02:42:16,293
We think that the budget belongs in the hands of the people who run the district, most importantly, the people who are closest to the classrooms.

1220
02:42:17,034 --> 02:42:26,820
So your principals, your directors who are really directly involved with the act of teaching and learning, those are the people in whose hands the budget should be.

1221
02:42:28,337 --> 02:42:51,049
What we do in our work is we advise people, we tell you if you have the money or you don't have the money, and we advise you about ways that you can make use of all of the funds that you get, whether it's your local appropriation, any of your grants, those kinds of other resources that are out there, revolving accounts and whatnot, to be able to put those pieces together to get a comprehensive budget picture.

1222
02:42:51,690 --> 02:42:55,492
But it really should be in the hands of the people who are closest to the students.

1223
02:42:55,932 --> 02:42:57,253
So again, that's part of what,

1224
02:42:58,287 --> 02:43:01,028
beginning this process earlier allows to have happen.

1225
02:43:01,368 --> 02:43:02,568
You can take a look at the data.

1226
02:43:02,608 --> 02:43:03,749
How are our kids doing?

1227
02:43:03,869 --> 02:43:06,449
Obviously, you're going to be gathering baseline data right now.

1228
02:43:06,929 --> 02:43:11,111
And then say, OK, what do we want to do in the first year of this strategic plan?

1229
02:43:11,471 --> 02:43:15,552
And what resources do we need to get us to that first year end game?

1230
02:43:16,492 --> 02:43:20,173
And then measure the effectiveness of those resources on that.

1231
02:43:20,353 --> 02:43:22,974
And if things are going well, move forward.

1232
02:43:23,074 --> 02:43:26,395
If they're not, then reassess and reevaluate on that.

1233
02:43:29,751 --> 02:43:30,111
You're on.

1234
02:43:30,592 --> 02:43:31,012
Thanks.

1235
02:43:32,193 --> 02:43:58,068
So not a surprise, the recommendations around financial management really centered around the software and making sure that you get a committee together as soon as possible to be able to come up with a system that will allow you to be able to speak on the same platform across every department.

1236
02:43:58,682 --> 02:44:04,647
from the school side and the city side to make sure that everybody has access to the same data.

1237
02:44:05,868 --> 02:44:10,172
I think that we've heard a lot about cyber attacks and cybersecurity.

1238
02:44:10,572 --> 02:44:20,501
That only makes it even more important to look at your total structure across your financial software system.

1239
02:44:21,362 --> 02:44:25,165
The payroll encumbrance is obviously most of the bigger

1240
02:44:25,635 --> 02:44:28,556
names in the business do allow for that.

1241
02:44:30,757 --> 02:44:43,002
There's so many things that some of these systems can do from a 24-7 help desk for anyone to ask a question along with professional development modules.

1242
02:44:43,463 --> 02:44:54,107
So there is a tremendous amount of training that can go on to make sure that everybody can manage the same data on one system.

1243
02:44:55,085 --> 02:45:04,089
The efficiency is amazing when you can log how many hours you've spent.

1244
02:45:04,950 --> 02:45:13,834
Now, just the manual calculation for 600 professional staff, I'm good with numbers, but I'm not ever that good.

1245
02:45:15,154 --> 02:45:20,297
And to be able to find them asleep, if there was one down the road, and then to have to backtrack.

1246
02:45:21,717 --> 02:45:37,369
I think the recommendation would certainly be to put a committee together of every stakeholder from the city side to the school side to really come up with what might be the best way to proceed.

1247
02:45:37,850 --> 02:45:42,033
They're not inexpensive, but they pay for themselves very quickly.

1248
02:45:43,214 --> 02:45:49,719
And the efficiency, the effectiveness, the accuracy, the data that you can retrieve as

1249
02:45:51,768 --> 02:45:57,732
It's just amazing how much you can do when you have that type of system in place.

1250
02:45:58,193 --> 02:46:02,536
So that is certainly the number one recommendation.

1251
02:46:02,836 --> 02:46:04,277
And it is a long process.

1252
02:46:04,598 --> 02:46:09,381
It will take you probably a good six to 12 months to get this fully up and running.

1253
02:46:09,461 --> 02:46:10,622
So be prepared for that.

1254
02:46:11,663 --> 02:46:13,124
It is arduous.

1255
02:46:14,245 --> 02:46:20,510
And making sure that not only the initial training goes on for staff who are going to be using it, but that there's ongoing training

1256
02:46:21,142 --> 02:46:32,908
that you invest in to make sure that, again, the features that are available through something that's far more robust can be available to you to make the accounting system easier.

1257
02:46:33,408 --> 02:46:36,790
When you have multiple systems, there is opportunity for error.

1258
02:46:37,210 --> 02:46:39,231
There's no way around it.

1259
02:46:39,852 --> 02:46:47,275
And if you're trying to do things like, I have done step and lane changes in a spreadsheet, it is not easy work.

1260
02:46:47,335 --> 02:46:48,656
It's very time consuming.

1261
02:46:51,120 --> 02:46:52,400
an opportunity for error.

1262
02:46:52,460 --> 02:46:56,462
So, you know, the fortunate thing at TMS is we work together as a team.

1263
02:46:56,502 --> 02:46:59,263
So you do your work and you have someone else check it.

1264
02:46:59,703 --> 02:47:06,545
And oftentimes we do find errors if we have to do it manually, because it is just such a difficult task to be able to do.

1265
02:47:06,865 --> 02:47:13,387
So to be able to say to the financial software, can you please roll everybody over and it just does it.

1266
02:47:14,492 --> 02:47:18,254
And you know that the algorithms are in the background to support that work.

1267
02:47:18,634 --> 02:47:21,835
It just makes it a whole lot easier and a whole lot more accurate as well.

1268
02:47:22,455 --> 02:47:28,397
And if there's any one thing we know in this business, it's pay needs to be accurate.

1269
02:47:30,018 --> 02:47:30,658
Absolutely.

1270
02:47:31,319 --> 02:47:34,660
So just some final conclusions from the report.

1271
02:47:36,792 --> 02:47:48,102
You know, as you've gone through tonight's presentations, you are a large and complex district with a diverse student population, certainly.

1272
02:47:49,023 --> 02:47:56,330
But now you have really a strong professional team in place, both at the business office level.

1273
02:47:56,990 --> 02:47:59,372
I can't say enough for your business office staff.

1274
02:48:00,233 --> 02:48:02,315
They're very competent and very,

1275
02:48:03,244 --> 02:48:04,004
caring people.

1276
02:48:04,044 --> 02:48:08,206
They want to do right by the school district and right by the children that you educate.

1277
02:48:08,246 --> 02:48:09,167
They really do.

1278
02:48:09,907 --> 02:48:11,227
So my hat is off to them.

1279
02:48:11,448 --> 02:48:14,269
I think Alan would certainly echo that sentiment as well.

1280
02:48:14,529 --> 02:48:17,430
Very professional, really wanting to do the right thing.

1281
02:48:18,390 --> 02:48:23,873
So you've got now a good administrative team in place that's working collaboratively.

1282
02:48:23,993 --> 02:48:28,315
So I think this is the moment for you to be able to move forward.

1283
02:48:29,455 --> 02:48:31,276
The challenges will be.

1284
02:48:31,905 --> 02:48:36,388
difficult because it is a change of the way of doing business and that's always hard.

1285
02:48:36,468 --> 02:48:47,235
But I think if you're willing to do the work, I think you'll find that, you know, that's going to really just pay off for you in ways that are amazingly wonderful.

1286
02:48:47,775 --> 02:48:57,462
And it was just interesting as I was looking on your website just to see about policies, which your policy manual is in really good place around the business practices.

1287
02:48:57,502 --> 02:49:00,804
So that was not something we had a concern about by any stretch of the imagination.

1288
02:49:01,592 --> 02:49:08,998
But just noticing that, you know, your tagline at the top is that you are curing educational partnership of school, family and community.

1289
02:49:09,418 --> 02:49:13,841
And that's what it will take to be able to just build a really strong school district.

1290
02:49:13,921 --> 02:49:15,803
And I think you're really right on the right path.

1291
02:49:16,283 --> 02:49:19,425
And we hope that this information will help you move forward.

1292
02:49:20,226 --> 02:49:20,546
Thank you.

1293
02:49:22,708 --> 02:49:23,068
Thank you.

1294
02:49:25,650 --> 02:49:27,051
Member Van de Kloot and Member Graham.

1295
02:49:28,448 --> 02:49:29,709
Thank you for your presentation.

1296
02:49:29,749 --> 02:49:31,390
That was very, very interesting.

1297
02:49:32,210 --> 02:49:43,356
And I'm sure that you've, since you've worked in different districts and whatever, and you must be familiar with some of the software that's out there for what you're suggesting.

1298
02:49:45,037 --> 02:49:50,700
Do, can you give us an idea of what, when you say, yes, it's expensive, are we talking 500,000?

1299
02:49:51,601 --> 02:49:55,743
Are we talking, you know, what ballpark?

1300
02:49:55,783 --> 02:49:56,744
Because this clearly is,

1301
02:49:57,350 --> 02:49:59,891
not only the school side, but the city side as well.

1302
02:50:00,652 --> 02:50:08,156
And I know you don't want to be pegged to a number, but, you know, I'm not sure that I know what your big is or your expensive is.

1303
02:50:08,716 --> 02:50:09,757
Just trying to get an idea.

1304
02:50:11,598 --> 02:50:12,618
I'm careful.

1305
02:50:13,119 --> 02:50:14,439
Yes.

1306
02:50:15,020 --> 02:50:21,703
So I had a superintendent doing all these budget presentations at the press.

1307
02:50:21,723 --> 02:50:24,585
We've had a lot of interesting people there and

1308
02:50:25,548 --> 02:50:28,790
I made the mistake of saying a number one time.

1309
02:50:29,190 --> 02:50:30,171
Yeah, that's what I figured you'd say.

1310
02:50:30,191 --> 02:50:34,373
Well, that was the front page of the telegram that said the next day.

1311
02:50:34,393 --> 02:50:35,854
But you can't blame me for trying, though.

1312
02:50:35,874 --> 02:50:40,416
But the reason why is because it tends to get blown out of proportion.

1313
02:50:40,676 --> 02:50:50,962
So no matter what I said, it wouldn't be fair to you guys, I should really do diligence to look and see what the packages are.

1314
02:50:51,702 --> 02:50:52,683
But I used to always say,

1315
02:50:54,114 --> 02:50:59,157
I really don't have that number in front of me, but I would be glad to work on it overnight.

1316
02:50:59,257 --> 02:51:02,159
And would you like me to email you or call me tomorrow?

1317
02:51:02,340 --> 02:51:04,441
I'd be happy to give you that.

1318
02:51:04,941 --> 02:51:08,324
But it is expensive.

1319
02:51:08,544 --> 02:51:10,305
It's time consuming.

1320
02:51:10,345 --> 02:51:12,526
But the benefits are so far reaching.

1321
02:51:12,686 --> 02:51:13,427
It's worth the effort.

1322
02:51:14,228 --> 02:51:20,612
And it depends on the number of user licenses you have, the number of employees that have to be processed through the system.

1323
02:51:20,652 --> 02:51:21,352
So it's really,

1324
02:51:22,802 --> 02:51:26,063
dependent on your specific instance.

1325
02:51:26,543 --> 02:51:36,267
So again, as Alan has reminded me, that I don't think I would do you a good service by trying to give you a number at this point.

1326
02:51:36,987 --> 02:51:46,130
But there are several major players out there that we have worked with at TMS that I think you can certainly evaluate for your specific needs.

1327
02:51:47,050 --> 02:51:52,032
But that would certainly do a great job for you and make things much more efficient than

1328
02:51:52,529 --> 02:51:53,450
current practice.

1329
02:51:53,470 --> 02:52:02,837
And have you shared with perhaps Mr. Murphy what some of those biggest players are that you would suggest we look at?

1330
02:52:03,478 --> 02:52:06,300
I do believe that he and Mr. Parkett have had that conversation.

1331
02:52:06,320 --> 02:52:06,760
Okay.

1332
02:52:06,780 --> 02:52:08,842
Okay, that's true.

1333
02:52:08,862 --> 02:52:09,542
You're on the spot.

1334
02:52:12,565 --> 02:52:12,925
Thank you.

1335
02:52:15,007 --> 02:52:15,387
Member Graham?

1336
02:52:18,098 --> 02:52:19,899
Thank you for your report.

1337
02:52:20,279 --> 02:52:22,480
I just had a couple of clarifying questions.

1338
02:52:23,341 --> 02:52:31,025
Is it standard practice that school committee, school expenditures would require authorization from city hall?

1339
02:52:34,607 --> 02:52:35,627
It's a great question.

1340
02:52:35,847 --> 02:52:40,229
And some of it depends on city charters and how things are written.

1341
02:52:40,950 --> 02:52:47,093
Some of it, again, it's sort of district specific and municipality specific.

1342
02:52:47,957 --> 02:52:57,799
Um, you know, right now we're doing a lot of work for the Greenfield public schools, which is a small city, certainly the size of, by any stretch of the imagination.

1343
02:52:58,619 --> 02:53:10,161
Um, but most of the, um, purchases, you know, daily purchase orders and whatever are processed on the school side with good, what we call in the business internal controls.

1344
02:53:10,702 --> 02:53:15,763
So we have people who put forward requisitions that get signed.

1345
02:53:16,383 --> 02:53:17,423
Um, you know, we have, um,

1346
02:53:18,190 --> 02:53:26,292
bookkeeper who then processes them, sends them to the business administrator, you know, who then verifies and so on and so forth.

1347
02:53:26,332 --> 02:53:28,513
So there's internal controls along the way.

1348
02:53:28,873 --> 02:53:30,373
I think that's the key issue.

1349
02:53:31,394 --> 02:53:34,094
For example, in Greenfield, however, it's a big procurement.

1350
02:53:34,154 --> 02:53:41,436
We work with the city procurement officer to make sure that that process is all done in the way that it should be.

1351
02:53:41,516 --> 02:53:46,618
So I would say that, you know, your city charter may govern some of this.

1352
02:53:47,825 --> 02:53:51,006
you know, not having seen it, I can't speak to that.

1353
02:53:51,046 --> 02:54:00,707
But again, you know, it's how much of the routine things could be done in the school department internally with a good set of internal controls.

1354
02:54:00,767 --> 02:54:04,628
And again, you have a great staff who could certainly provide that check and balance for each other.

1355
02:54:04,948 --> 02:54:10,949
So it's again, how do you put those processes into place to make them work efficiently and well?

1356
02:54:11,949 --> 02:54:16,910
And Mr. Murphy, are you aware whether the charter outlines that as a requirement where the mayor

1357
02:54:19,540 --> 02:54:23,262
seems unlikely to me, but I'm not a charter expert.

1358
02:54:23,382 --> 02:54:27,164
I would assume finance laws, but I don't think the charter is only a couple pages long.

1359
02:54:27,184 --> 02:54:28,525
I don't think the charter outlines it.

1360
02:54:28,965 --> 02:54:29,245
I'm sorry.

1361
02:54:29,405 --> 02:54:30,586
I don't believe it's included in the chart.

1362
02:54:30,606 --> 02:54:43,273
I would say that for municipalities structured like the city of Medford that I've worked in association with in the past, it's not uncommon for the chief auditor of the city to have a signature authority.

1363
02:54:43,773 --> 02:54:47,315
There's a different body of law with respect to school-based expenditures.

1364
02:54:47,802 --> 02:55:03,331
And so it would be, generally speaking, improper and just not really realistic for municipal discretion over anything related to a strategy or judgment calls with regard to investments.

1365
02:55:03,751 --> 02:55:06,493
State law is pretty clear in terms of building a wall around that.

1366
02:55:06,793 --> 02:55:15,078
But from a strictly a compliance perspective, a lot of the expenditures, the law does not necessarily distinguish between the municipality

1367
02:55:15,554 --> 02:55:18,135
and the school district as its own autonomous entity.

1368
02:55:18,555 --> 02:55:23,598
And so the authority therefore is based on the chief municipal financial officer or auditor.

1369
02:55:23,618 --> 02:55:26,859
So the original question being, is that unusual?

1370
02:55:26,899 --> 02:55:28,920
I would say, no, I don't think it's unusual.

1371
02:55:29,821 --> 02:55:42,607
I think the issue, and just to be clear, I have not known this to be a persistent issue with Medford by any means in terms of my time here, but it's just a matter of making sure that the controls in place are sufficiently efficient

1372
02:55:43,048 --> 02:55:50,270
to make sure that in addition to having the decision-making authority, the school side is able to act with expediency when necessary.

1373
02:55:50,290 --> 02:55:52,830
And generally speaking, that has been my experience here.

1374
02:55:53,631 --> 02:55:53,991
Thank you.

1375
02:55:54,211 --> 02:55:54,611
Thank you.

1376
02:55:55,471 --> 02:56:10,955
And I think the other question or clarification I just wanted from you both is the budget system that you're talking about, is it a requirement that the city and schools would need to implement together

1377
02:56:11,912 --> 02:56:24,020
or is it possible that the school district could pursue an implementation to make its own shop efficient with or serve with or without the city?

1378
02:56:24,780 --> 02:56:27,222
I'm just trying to understand, is it like a package deal?

1379
02:56:27,242 --> 02:56:29,543
Is it recommended to be a package deal?

1380
02:56:30,323 --> 02:56:32,585
And what do you give up if that is not the case?

1381
02:56:34,186 --> 02:56:40,790
So the software package does not have to cover both

1382
02:56:42,006 --> 02:56:50,288
departments, city site and school site, there may be some efficiencies and some cost efficiencies if you procure for both.

1383
02:56:51,369 --> 02:56:59,671
However, as Mr. Murphy said, the school budget is the responsibility of the superintendent and school committee.

1384
02:57:00,011 --> 02:57:10,354
And so many districts now are procuring together with the municipal side across a lot of things.

1385
02:57:10,674 --> 02:57:11,074
So that may

1386
02:57:12,272 --> 02:57:14,034
If that's the factor, then that may differ.

1387
02:57:14,434 --> 02:57:19,939
I would like the system to be able to be broad enough to cover all.

1388
02:57:20,419 --> 02:57:24,103
But certainly, school budgets are unique.

1389
02:57:24,463 --> 02:57:31,629
School budgets require a certain structure to be able to manage them.

1390
02:57:31,669 --> 02:57:39,456
So I think you would probably be able to answer that question with your due diligence on different systems.

1391
02:57:40,648 --> 02:57:44,389
based upon they would be asked what you would intend to support.

1392
02:57:46,530 --> 02:58:10,078
And there are reporting requirements obviously on the school side to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education as there are reporting requirements on the municipal side and those do cross paths and end-of-the-year reports so schools are required to report on the city's contribution to the school's efforts and likewise on the municipal side

1393
02:58:11,002 --> 02:58:22,086
the city reports also to the Department of, Division of Local Services, how they're expending funds in the name of the city and also on the school side.

1394
02:58:22,426 --> 02:58:31,009
So having a common software to work with allows for that reporting to be pretty seamless between the city side and the school side.

1395
02:58:31,489 --> 02:58:38,411
Most districts I work in, I've worked in, that is the case that they do share the same platform because it just makes it easier

1396
02:58:38,855 --> 02:58:41,278
again, and more efficient on both sides of the ledger.

1397
02:58:42,619 --> 02:58:45,282
And I just have two more questions, if that's okay.

1398
02:58:46,803 --> 02:58:57,314
So my first question is, you mentioned a six to 12 month implementation window, and as a systems implementer in government, that is like lightning fast.

1399
02:58:57,414 --> 02:58:59,456
So I'm just curious, why is that

1400
02:59:02,315 --> 02:59:05,197
the normal experience of implementing such a software?

1401
02:59:05,237 --> 02:59:24,787
I mean, usually in a complex organization, which certainly the city of Medford qualifies because of all of its disparities across like departments who do completely different things, all kinds of different structures, lots of different like kind of cross sections, like you're looking typically at like 12 to 18.

1402
02:59:24,867 --> 02:59:27,588
Is there a reason why these systems implement so fast?

1403
02:59:28,469 --> 02:59:31,150
Or is that just like the best case scenario?

1404
02:59:31,565 --> 02:59:36,566
Um, probably best case scenario, obviously, the smaller the entity, the shorter the period of time.

1405
02:59:37,006 --> 02:59:47,829
Right now we are working with Windsor Connecticut public schools that just started a implementation process of one of these systems.

1406
02:59:48,249 --> 02:59:58,231
And it's going to be about a year by the time the town and the school department have all of the training and all of the integrations that need to be in a city the size of Medford.

1407
02:59:58,271 --> 03:00:01,332
It could be more like the 12 to 18 month window.

1408
03:00:01,768 --> 03:00:24,428
sure okay thank you and my last question i think is for mr murphy um mr parkett would like to potentially answer one of your questions we already asked so why don't we give him a chance and i'll go back to you mr parkett uh yes good evening everyone uh i apologize for not being able to make it in person um just one of the things i'll say regarding that timeline yes

1409
03:00:25,163 --> 03:00:38,256
It's, it's aggressive but we also don't want to paint the picture that what is currently in place is this, it is a solid foundation I mean there is on the admins it is both on the school and the city side.

1410
03:00:38,696 --> 03:00:43,581
There is a crosswalk already in place between the school accounts in the city account so

1411
03:00:44,181 --> 03:00:51,548
a lot of the foundation for any consideration of a conversion to a more robust comprehensive financial accounting system.

1412
03:00:52,809 --> 03:00:55,532
We already have the foundation in place with what it is there.

1413
03:00:55,572 --> 03:01:06,802
So it's, I'll say any discussion regarding a new financial accounting system, I'll say we're starting at like step four or five already towards it.

1414
03:01:06,822 --> 03:01:09,585
So that's just one of the, I just wanted to clarify that.

1415
03:01:11,867 --> 03:01:19,649
And many of the systems now have the ability to easily import what you can export from what you currently have and dump it in.

1416
03:01:20,129 --> 03:01:23,270
And so that does, again, you're not trying to build it from scratch.

1417
03:01:23,470 --> 03:01:27,051
So that's also something that'll be helpful along the way.

1418
03:01:28,251 --> 03:01:37,134
And my last question, you all alluded to lots of things that are already happening because the change of leadership happened earlier this year.

1419
03:01:37,654 --> 03:01:41,155
Is this procurement something that is actively in the works or is this

1420
03:01:42,532 --> 03:01:45,454
not yet moving forward.

1421
03:01:48,676 --> 03:02:04,225
With respect to the software system, it is something we've had initial discussions on, and particularly as the funding has come in from the federal government, it's been one of the things both internally, and to be perfectly honest, I think it's something myself and Ms.

1422
03:02:04,245 --> 03:02:08,848
Nunley have spoken about, but we speak with such regularity

1423
03:02:10,433 --> 03:02:24,204
I'm actually I just can't recall the specific instance in which we discuss this but I would be surprised if we have and I know members of my team have discussed it with representatives are from her up so no not and we have not sort of put out additional hour.

1424
03:02:24,244 --> 03:02:25,485
He's right along those lines.

1425
03:02:26,105 --> 03:02:33,311
But it's certainly something that we're actively considering I think with respect to your question about doesn't have to be done jointly.

1426
03:02:33,991 --> 03:02:35,793
I have significant reservations

1427
03:02:36,218 --> 03:02:42,682
about the prospect of creating new inefficiencies in an attempt to resolve our current inefficiencies.

1428
03:02:42,762 --> 03:02:58,931
And I think the prospect of going it alone with Munis, I'm not sure if we're supposed to not say Munis, but that's certainly the entity that we would be most likely to want to consider and the one that's the most commonly used in both municipalities and school districts in Massachusetts.

1429
03:03:00,252 --> 03:03:04,835
But I think it's definitely something we'd want to engage in in collaboration with the city.

1430
03:03:05,905 --> 03:03:14,787
I think they know where we stand I guess if they don't they do now, but I'm pretty sure that that I'm pretty sure that they do and it's something that will be imagine talking about a couple months.

1431
03:03:15,427 --> 03:03:15,767
Thank you.

1432
03:03:15,787 --> 03:03:16,067
Thank you.

1433
03:03:22,808 --> 03:03:26,029
And what else I make a motion to approve the report.

1434
03:03:27,029 --> 03:03:31,890
Miss it on file sure section to replace which one.

1435
03:03:33,570 --> 03:03:39,653
Okay, motion to place the report on file by member Graham, seconded by member McLaughlin.

1436
03:03:40,333 --> 03:03:40,773
Roll call.

1437
03:03:41,033 --> 03:03:43,735
All in favor?

1438
03:03:44,635 --> 03:03:44,815
Aye.

1439
03:03:45,095 --> 03:03:45,655
All opposed?

1440
03:03:45,675 --> 03:03:48,577
This is received and placed on file.

1441
03:03:48,597 --> 03:03:49,797
Thank you so much for being with us.

1442
03:03:49,977 --> 03:03:50,337
Thank you.

1443
03:03:50,397 --> 03:03:51,338
Thank you so much.

1444
03:03:51,378 --> 03:03:52,618
Have a good evening.

1445
03:03:57,441 --> 03:04:02,923
I'll just add my thanks to Andy in a car phone from Western Mass for joining us on this one.

1446
03:04:03,442 --> 03:04:04,282
No, on the last one.

1447
03:04:04,923 --> 03:04:05,223
Okay.

1448
03:04:05,363 --> 03:04:05,723
Number eight.

1449
03:04:05,743 --> 03:04:09,544
I thought we were number nine now.

1450
03:04:09,905 --> 03:04:10,505
Oh, okay.

1451
03:04:10,845 --> 03:04:10,965
Sorry.

1452
03:04:11,285 --> 03:04:12,546
Oh, you're going to add to the number eight?

1453
03:04:12,846 --> 03:04:17,328
No, I'm just saying thank you, Mr. Parkett, for his time and joining us remotely.

1454
03:04:17,808 --> 03:04:18,928
Thank you, Mr. Parkett.

1455
03:04:19,268 --> 03:04:20,009
Thank you so much.

1456
03:04:21,309 --> 03:04:24,130
Number nine, introduction of engagement hub initiative.

1457
03:04:24,230 --> 03:04:25,471
Mr. David Murphy and Ms.

1458
03:04:25,511 --> 03:04:26,591
Megan Fidler-Carrie.

1459
03:04:27,412 --> 03:04:27,872
Thank you, Mayor.

1460
03:04:28,533 --> 03:04:30,414
So the presentation that Ms.

1461
03:04:30,434 --> 03:04:40,480
Fidler-Carey and I will be presenting before you this evening is in many respects a follow-up to previous conversations we've had before the school committee.

1462
03:04:41,040 --> 03:04:55,469
And specifically, I'm referring to the consideration that you undertook earlier this calendar year in reforming the former supervisor of attendance position to the newly named re-engagement specialist position.

1463
03:04:56,117 --> 03:05:04,420
And then in addition to that, the committee is aware that during our budget presentation, the administration presented our intention to expand Ms.

1464
03:05:04,460 --> 03:05:13,704
Fidler-Carey's portfolio currently as the director of before and after school care to the position of director of family and or community engagement.

1465
03:05:14,204 --> 03:05:17,825
Frankly, that's a title that we're still doing some work on and is under construction.

1466
03:05:17,885 --> 03:05:21,726
But the purpose behind examining Ms.

1467
03:05:21,746 --> 03:05:22,987
Fidler-Carey's portfolio

1468
03:05:23,503 --> 03:05:46,850
And I think the purpose that we shared in changing the former supervisor of attendance position was a recognition that as we come out of the post, come out of the pandemic period into the post pandemic period, we are aware that there is a significant amount of engagement and re-engagement work that we as an organization are going to have to double down on and perhaps triple or quadruple down on.

1469
03:05:47,270 --> 03:05:51,431
Because we know that the relationship between our school communities and some students and families

1470
03:05:52,057 --> 03:05:57,079
has been damaged as a result of this tremendous disruption that we have all experienced in our lives.

1471
03:05:57,699 --> 03:06:07,502
And we know that there's a need to reestablish that nexus and to make sure that all of our students are feeling as though they are fully members of their school communities.

1472
03:06:07,902 --> 03:06:14,383
And so we had sort of this confluence where we were recognizing the need to shift around some responsibilities related to engagement.

1473
03:06:14,804 --> 03:06:19,645
We know that the work is proliferating with respect to engagement.

1474
03:06:20,162 --> 03:06:26,684
And frankly, we have funding opportunities that we discussed during the course of the budget process, particularly with the answer budget.

1475
03:06:26,964 --> 03:06:37,787
And so we started to think differently about perhaps instead of hiring one re engagement specialist in the hope that they can fulfill the modified duties of the former attendance officer position.

1476
03:06:38,220 --> 03:06:53,673
in the sense that we were trying to transition away from the punitive approach to keeping students in school or penalizing them when they're not, and toward more of a preventative and restorative approach to building the comprehensive supports that we know students and families need in order to maintain that strong nexus.

1477
03:06:54,053 --> 03:06:59,758
We started to look at that and see that there may be a way to look at these objectives in tandem with one another.

1478
03:07:00,158 --> 03:07:06,123
And so as we went into the interview process for the re-engagement specialist position,

1479
03:07:06,485 --> 03:07:21,350
We started to think along the lines of putting together what would essentially amount to a tactical team that would be as part of a pilot approach, at least in the short term using ESSER funding, and deploy this team under Megan's leadership, under Ms.

1480
03:07:21,370 --> 03:07:32,053
Fidley-Carrie's leadership, excuse me, to support school leaders and other personnel in the building and rebuilding of strong constructive relationships between students and families

1481
03:07:32,459 --> 03:07:33,420
and with school communities.

1482
03:07:33,760 --> 03:07:50,133
And so the slide that you have before you there specifies something that I think is very important, that we know both what we're doing as we make this investment and prioritize in this revised way of thinking around engagement and re-engagement and what we're not doing.

1483
03:07:51,174 --> 03:07:59,781
This tactical team that we are putting together as part of a group of re-engagement specialists, that is not the first time we're going to be doing engagement work.

1484
03:08:00,345 --> 03:08:18,899
We are very fortunate to have various offices and departments and school-based personnel from adjustment counselors to administrators to teachers, paraprofessionals, and a variety of other Metro Public Schools staff who are devoted on a daily basis to doing this exact type of work and advancing the cause of family and community engagement.

1485
03:08:19,239 --> 03:08:28,266
But we also understand that there are variables that have changed and that will change as we go into the 21-22 school year, and we have to respond and we have to do some things differently.

1486
03:08:28,616 --> 03:08:43,960
And so the goal here is to use this entity that we are developing to leverage the strength of the organization as a whole in support of the work that's happening within school communities to sort of advance our relationship through three distinct groups.

1487
03:08:44,621 --> 03:08:54,404
I'll describe it as group one, the students who we know are in, they're in school and they're enrolled in school, but the nexus is diminished.

1488
03:08:54,464 --> 03:08:55,884
It's not as strong as it needs to be.

1489
03:08:56,474 --> 03:09:08,457
The second group are groups that is not enrolled, and we need to, as the attendance officer would have in a previous iteration of this, we need to build back that relationship and strengthen that.

1490
03:09:08,677 --> 03:09:11,597
And the third group is really more about family engagement, frankly.

1491
03:09:11,897 --> 03:09:20,279
It's folks who have decided to enroll in other educational options that we have a responsibility to make sure that we as an organization are communicating the supports and services

1492
03:09:20,658 --> 03:09:25,521
that are available to them if they choose to come back into the fold and rejoin the Medford public schools.

1493
03:09:25,581 --> 03:09:33,385
And we know that that constituency going into the next school year is in some ways larger than it has been because of choices that families have made.

1494
03:09:33,425 --> 03:09:36,267
And that is certainly a choice that every family has a right to make.

1495
03:09:36,327 --> 03:09:49,654
And we respect every choice that is made within the Medford community, but it's also incumbent upon us to make sure that we're providing as much accurate information as possible about the programs and supports that are available within the public school district.

1496
03:09:50,095 --> 03:09:58,000
So that is an element of what we're presenting before you tonight with regard to the establishment of the tactical team of re-engagement specialists.

1497
03:09:58,300 --> 03:09:58,820
I'm gonna ask Ms.

1498
03:09:58,840 --> 03:10:12,409
Fidler-Carey to talk a little bit about our change in thinking with regard to having what is currently a series of offices that are each responsible for various elements of engagement and re-engagement and putting them into a engagement hub.

1499
03:10:12,729 --> 03:10:15,150
That's not to say they're not being collapsed into one department.

1500
03:10:15,190 --> 03:10:18,232
Megan is not being asked to run half the district in engagement.

1501
03:10:18,272 --> 03:10:19,493
That's not what the hub represents.

1502
03:10:19,907 --> 03:10:25,688
What the hub does represent is our recognition that as an organization, we have to be less siloed.

1503
03:10:26,089 --> 03:10:34,271
And so rather than just create another department, we are creating an entity that is responsible for facilitating the collaboration across different offices and departments.

1504
03:10:34,611 --> 03:10:35,991
And that's what we're asking Megan to do.

1505
03:10:36,271 --> 03:10:37,751
Hi.

1506
03:10:38,212 --> 03:10:39,692
Thank you for this opportunity to speak.

1507
03:10:39,712 --> 03:10:42,693
It's really nice to see everybody in person and see everyone's face.

1508
03:10:44,378 --> 03:10:59,204
So this is a really exciting opportunity for me personally, of course, but I think for the district, I think it's just a way to bring together terrific departments that are already working well and working well together, but it's just sort of formalizing the communication between departments.

1509
03:10:59,644 --> 03:11:13,370
It's sort of formalizing, if there's a request for information from one department to the other, I can be there to sort of facilitate the urgency of it, and it's not piling more work on

1510
03:11:13,939 --> 03:11:18,122
and it's making it clearer what's urgent and what's not urgent.

1511
03:11:18,282 --> 03:11:21,264
So I think it's just a way to improve our communications.

1512
03:11:21,405 --> 03:11:28,049
I really like that this presentation is following the strategic plan presentation, because I think that these things dovetail really nicely.

1513
03:11:29,050 --> 03:11:33,854
I think that a lot of the student support is going to be happening here.

1514
03:11:34,754 --> 03:11:36,435
Family engagement happens at every level.

1515
03:11:36,495 --> 03:11:39,157
The principal is doing family engagement in all of their outreach.

1516
03:11:39,498 --> 03:11:42,660
The teachers constantly, the guidance counselors, adjustment counselors,

1517
03:11:43,030 --> 03:11:49,652
this new re-engagement team will be there to just sort of fill in some of those cracks, prevent cracks from happening.

1518
03:11:49,772 --> 03:12:00,395
I think, you know, when I, I think you guys have heard me say this before, when I hire for the before and after school program, I always say to them, it just takes that one adult to be the change in any student's life.

1519
03:12:00,575 --> 03:12:03,035
And isn't it exciting that you might be that one adult, you know?

1520
03:12:03,135 --> 03:12:12,258
So if it doesn't happen to be the principal or the teacher or the guidance counselor, maybe it's somebody from this re-engagement team that will make a connection with the student or make a connection with the family

1521
03:12:12,648 --> 03:12:15,650
to build the necessary trust to re-engage them back into it.

1522
03:12:16,710 --> 03:12:26,076
So I love the idea that we're putting together a team because we'll be able to get people's human strengths and experience and kind of put it together into a nice circle like this, like a puzzle.

1523
03:12:26,476 --> 03:12:40,605
So, you know, we're gonna do that marketing that we mentioned in the, I think that's in the ACE of ACEs, you know, get our marketing together so that we can do a better job of explaining to families what our public schools offer, that they're not getting at charter schools, that they're not getting at parochial schools,

1524
03:12:41,760 --> 03:12:54,323
And I think that that's a way that we can really hyper focus all eight hours of our day and beyond as we all know that you know teachers and people in the schools don't have because they're focused on curriculum instruction as well.

1525
03:12:54,743 --> 03:13:01,605
So we're everybody that we've looked at so far for that's applied for this job has had

1526
03:13:02,025 --> 03:13:07,309
has mentioned social work, has mentioned restorative justice values, and that's really exciting.

1527
03:13:07,389 --> 03:13:17,457
It's all very positive, it's all very strength-based, and it's all really away from that punitive, that truancy officer driving down trying to catch the kid, going to the mall.

1528
03:13:18,278 --> 03:13:19,999
We're totally moved away from that.

1529
03:13:20,419 --> 03:13:29,386
It's really about establishing relationships, figuring out if there's a student not coming to school, figuring out why, and then meeting their needs, connecting them to the resources they need.

1530
03:13:29,466 --> 03:13:31,308
So I'm very excited, I think.

1531
03:13:32,774 --> 03:13:33,855
It's gonna be very successful.

1532
03:13:35,176 --> 03:13:35,356
I agree.

1533
03:13:35,376 --> 03:13:36,737
I think it'll be successful as well.

1534
03:13:36,777 --> 03:13:44,943
So again, the engagement hub and the re-engagement specialist team, two components of the information that we're sharing with you tonight that we're very excited about.

1535
03:13:45,263 --> 03:13:49,186
It also frankly represents our, well, we discussed many of them over the course of the budget process.

1536
03:13:49,226 --> 03:14:01,455
And as we present in the coming weeks, I don't think there'll be too many surprises with regard to our ESSER based budgetary recommendations and priorities, but this does represent the first concrete example of where the district intends to

1537
03:14:02,134 --> 03:14:03,535
devote ESSER funding.

1538
03:14:03,715 --> 03:14:07,177
And I think, you know, as I said, I think this is a good thing to do.

1539
03:14:07,237 --> 03:14:13,161
I think this is something that districts, I think we know that historically, it's something that we could do better as a profession within education.

1540
03:14:13,941 --> 03:14:16,723
But coming out of the pandemic, it's just going to be that much more important.

1541
03:14:16,763 --> 03:14:27,229
There have been too many stories that many of us have heard in this school district and others, where the effects of the pandemic are being felt in the most pronounced way.

1542
03:14:27,956 --> 03:14:30,638
by some of our most vulnerable and high-risk learners.

1543
03:14:30,678 --> 03:14:42,825
And so this is our way of, again, trying to build back that nexus and trying to strengthen that relationship in both preventative and restorative respect.

1544
03:14:43,425 --> 03:14:45,806
Do these positions exist four or five years from now?

1545
03:14:46,166 --> 03:14:47,667
Frankly, I don't know the answer to that.

1546
03:14:48,047 --> 03:14:50,989
I know that we have an urgent need right now that needs to be addressed.

1547
03:14:51,369 --> 03:14:52,330
It may well be the case

1548
03:14:52,852 --> 03:15:01,055
If this model works, as we hope that it does, and if the hub may become an indispensable element of the Medford Public Schools, I hope that it does, frankly.

1549
03:15:01,075 --> 03:15:06,337
And that will be incumbent upon us to determine how do we ensure that it's sustainable in the years ahead.

1550
03:15:06,377 --> 03:15:09,838
But for right now, we know that this is work that needs to be done.

1551
03:15:10,278 --> 03:15:11,999
Just some of the sort of technicalities.

1552
03:15:13,019 --> 03:15:17,821
Right now, for re-engagement specialists, we're thinking of it as a 190-day position.

1553
03:15:18,861 --> 03:15:20,402
We are looking to

1554
03:15:22,107 --> 03:15:30,072
frankly, pay a competitive rate because there's an urgency to bringing, building this team and putting together a strong, diverse team.

1555
03:15:30,112 --> 03:15:36,116
And that's something that we prioritize throughout the recruitment process, and we'll continue to do so in the coming weeks.

1556
03:15:38,538 --> 03:15:44,342
I think those are the main pieces that I wanted to, and I guess I'll just say, I say 190 day position.

1557
03:15:44,362 --> 03:15:48,505
I think the exception to that is going to be the summer of 2021, because I don't want to ask Ms.

1558
03:15:48,545 --> 03:15:51,387
Federicari to stand up these systems and structures all by herself.

1559
03:15:52,157 --> 03:15:56,938
Our hope is to get the team together and start doing this work in the very, very near future.

1560
03:15:58,459 --> 03:15:59,719
And we'd be happy to take your questions.

1561
03:15:59,999 --> 03:16:00,359
Thank you.

1562
03:16:01,039 --> 03:16:01,620
Thank you very much.

1563
03:16:03,400 --> 03:16:07,301
Member Graham, Member Russo, Member McLaughlin, Member Van de Vroegh.

1564
03:16:08,962 --> 03:16:09,382
Thank you.

1565
03:16:09,642 --> 03:16:10,682
This is exciting.

1566
03:16:11,682 --> 03:16:15,903
You know, we've talked throughout the budget process about a couple of different things.

1567
03:16:15,963 --> 03:16:21,385
So one is sort of students needing more, especially sort of into

1568
03:16:21,885 --> 03:16:23,046
as we start the next year.

1569
03:16:23,086 --> 03:16:30,129
And we've also talked about the need to revisit our own organizational structure.

1570
03:16:30,149 --> 03:16:36,492
And I feel like this sort of starts to do both of those things at the same time, which is really exciting.

1571
03:16:37,933 --> 03:16:49,278
But I was just curious whether you had received any feedback from the administrative team as you created this and what that feedback was.

1572
03:16:50,256 --> 03:16:51,437
Yeah, that's a great question.

1573
03:16:51,457 --> 03:16:52,117
I think you're right.

1574
03:16:52,157 --> 03:16:53,298
I think it does.

1575
03:16:53,619 --> 03:17:01,184
I hope it's clear how this is sort of a natural outgrowth from some of the priorities that we identified during the course of the budget process.

1576
03:17:01,524 --> 03:17:07,309
You heard me, I think, speak on occasion about the siloing and over-departmentalization of the school district.

1577
03:17:07,389 --> 03:17:15,835
And so in the conception of this, the idea is to cultivate greater coherence and coordination across departments.

1578
03:17:16,195 --> 03:17:18,557
What we don't need, frankly, is a hub silo.

1579
03:17:18,977 --> 03:17:23,740
We don't need the re-engagement specialists to come together and work only within themselves on their own cases.

1580
03:17:24,100 --> 03:17:29,202
And so the idea is it's really sort of built upon this idea of cross interdepartmental collaboration.

1581
03:17:29,583 --> 03:17:34,705
And I would say with regard to the response, it has been both very positive and very revealing.

1582
03:17:35,025 --> 03:17:47,032
We've had a great opportunity to hear from principals who see us as having the opportunity to leverage the district to advance some of the work that they know that they are devoted to in spirit and in practice, but they,

1583
03:17:47,905 --> 03:18:08,673
they also have a building they need to run and instruction they need to provide and some you know and also as is always the case when you have organization you have the opportunity to hear questions and comments that indicate what people's priorities are and frankly I think I've been grateful for that transparency as well so I think it's something that we're we're really looking forward to and something that I think that school communities will benefit from significantly.

1584
03:18:11,955 --> 03:18:12,475
Members some.

1585
03:18:13,787 --> 03:18:14,167
Thank you.

1586
03:18:14,728 --> 03:18:19,612
I'm obviously very excited about this entire project.

1587
03:18:22,194 --> 03:18:25,816
We can use our SOA, but we don't get much from the Student Opportunity Act.

1588
03:18:25,996 --> 03:18:26,877
It's an understatement.

1589
03:18:27,998 --> 03:18:33,062
But family engagement is, I think, sort of, it's been a long year.

1590
03:18:33,943 --> 03:18:39,567
But we have to submit a report every year at what we're doing with our three extra nickels.

1591
03:18:40,508 --> 03:18:43,330
We can use this completely to satisfy those needs, correct?

1592
03:18:44,708 --> 03:18:50,570
I think with regard to the sort of compliance needs or with regard to the underlying sort of principles that are behind it.

1593
03:18:50,990 --> 03:18:52,851
And I mean, just the compliance needs.

1594
03:18:52,891 --> 03:18:54,111
Yeah, I would think so.

1595
03:18:54,151 --> 03:19:01,914
I mean, I'd want to frankly review the regulations more closely than I have before answering that, but I think this is a pretty whole of organization response.

1596
03:19:02,514 --> 03:19:12,138
And so as we sort of build out this team and think about how these different departments and offices will function in coordination with one another, I think it'll be challenging to

1597
03:19:13,531 --> 03:19:15,973
to think of a way that we could be more comprehensive than we're being.

1598
03:19:16,213 --> 03:19:17,494
But we'll continue to look at that.

1599
03:19:17,514 --> 03:19:18,575
So, thank you.

1600
03:19:19,977 --> 03:19:21,118
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

1601
03:19:21,178 --> 03:19:21,959
And Member Van de Kloet.

1602
03:19:23,840 --> 03:19:24,241
Thank you.

1603
03:19:24,421 --> 03:19:25,402
Thank you for the presentation.

1604
03:19:25,482 --> 03:19:27,143
It is very exciting.

1605
03:19:27,244 --> 03:19:29,045
It's long overdue.

1606
03:19:30,046 --> 03:19:35,711
Family and community engagement is critical throughout any business and district to engage all your stakeholders.

1607
03:19:38,061 --> 03:19:44,966
You know, I know you said we'll see where we are in a few years, but if we're building relationships, I certainly don't think that we're going to be able to cut them off after a few years.

1608
03:19:45,006 --> 03:19:46,327
So that's encouraging.

1609
03:19:46,727 --> 03:19:50,050
And we'll have to find a way to make sure that we continue this and make this happen.

1610
03:19:50,090 --> 03:19:56,214
But I wanted to ask, I guess, about the interdepartmental collaboration and the tactical team that you're building.

1611
03:19:56,815 --> 03:19:58,576
A few things.

1612
03:19:58,676 --> 03:20:00,658
One is obviously the re-engagement specialist.

1613
03:20:02,159 --> 03:20:06,662
And I wonder if there's, you know, just sort of the name of it, but we're not,

1614
03:20:07,413 --> 03:20:10,094
just thinking preventative, we're thinking proactive.

1615
03:20:10,694 --> 03:20:16,575
And so re-engagement feels like to me, we're talking about, oh, people have become disengaged and now we have to go and re-engage them, right?

1616
03:20:16,976 --> 03:20:18,136
We don't wanna get to that point.

1617
03:20:18,196 --> 03:20:20,196
We wanna be proactive and really start.

1618
03:20:20,537 --> 03:20:23,517
And I know that we have a year that we're reflecting on where people have been disengaged.

1619
03:20:23,557 --> 03:20:33,480
So I just sort of wanna make sure that we're focusing on the proactive and to that end, the school in Maine audit that we were able to have recently.

1620
03:20:34,120 --> 03:20:40,601
and looking at that family and community engagement audit and being able to, it's late in the end of the year and the end of the school year.

1621
03:20:40,621 --> 03:20:53,303
So we had talked about having some sort of presentation around that in September, around what that audit really showed, how we're proactively marrying to our strategic plan in this tactical team would be really great.

1622
03:20:53,603 --> 03:20:58,064
And then obviously I know that you guys are looking at diversity.

1623
03:20:58,164 --> 03:21:03,305
And so we're more thinking about our most vulnerable populations, as you were saying, ensuring that we're reaching them

1624
03:21:03,890 --> 03:21:10,274
you know, through and by people who they identify with, and that we're considering that as we're picking up.

1625
03:21:10,294 --> 03:21:13,857
And I'm sure you are, but I just wanted to, yeah, put that out there.

1626
03:21:13,917 --> 03:21:14,917
Thank you, very exciting.

1627
03:21:15,578 --> 03:21:27,506
Just to respond very briefly, I think the point about not sort of pigeonholing this work and those charged with doing it solely and from a re-engagement capacity, I think is really important.

1628
03:21:28,026 --> 03:21:31,568
As Member McLaughlin points out, the particular time in which we are

1629
03:21:32,873 --> 03:21:42,159
we are beginning this work, there is going to be more of a focus on re-engagement, certainly than I hope that there is in the years ahead, because that is sort of the immediate task before us.

1630
03:21:42,199 --> 03:21:53,966
But there's no question that the preventative side of the equation is to hope that from the very beginning, it's part of why we are one department that we are moving within to the, and to Megan's supervision, Ms.

1631
03:21:54,106 --> 03:22:01,590
Fidwikari's supervision, is the Parent Information Center, because we want to make sure that that relationship begins from the very inception of the relationship

1632
03:22:01,971 --> 03:22:06,214
with the district and hopefully grows from there throughout the student's academic career.

1633
03:22:08,896 --> 03:22:09,257
Thank you.

1634
03:22:09,357 --> 03:22:10,157
Member van de Klook?

1635
03:22:10,498 --> 03:22:10,718
Yes.

1636
03:22:10,898 --> 03:22:20,645
If you could just give us some specifics, how many members of the team are you envisioning at this point?

1637
03:22:21,306 --> 03:22:24,188
So Megan, and then how many?

1638
03:22:24,629 --> 03:22:25,729
It's a great question.

1639
03:22:27,205 --> 03:22:34,511
I'm I think we've we both feel fortunate we all feel fortunate to be in a position that we are really as for funding.

1640
03:22:36,113 --> 03:22:46,782
We have some flexibility with regard to that this isn't the only thing we're going to be doing with us or so we don't have unlimited flexibility and so when that when we we've discussed that.

1641
03:22:47,382 --> 03:22:50,365
And if I answer this differently than when I was correct.

1642
03:22:51,125 --> 03:22:55,309
But when we discuss that one of the pieces that we thought about is that well

1643
03:22:55,724 --> 03:23:04,126
This is happening in all different corners of the school district, and it's a top priority for all of our administrators and staff up and down the Metro Public Schools.

1644
03:23:04,886 --> 03:23:06,646
This is a slightly different way of doing it.

1645
03:23:07,086 --> 03:23:12,628
It's a greater emphasis on coordination, and it's a new group, a new group of staff who are charged with doing it.

1646
03:23:13,028 --> 03:23:17,889
And so I think we do feel some hesitancy to try to not, we don't wanna go too big too quickly.

1647
03:23:18,389 --> 03:23:24,170
And so, and at the same time, we can only build a system if we build a system.

1648
03:23:24,671 --> 03:23:27,553
And so it's not going to I don't envision it being one or two.

1649
03:23:27,873 --> 03:23:34,217
I think the short answer to the question is we're looking for three to five staff members to hire this summer to begin this work.

1650
03:23:34,597 --> 03:23:40,961
And whether it's three or whether it's five is going to depend on the applicant pool number one, and how as Ms.

1651
03:23:40,981 --> 03:23:45,784
Fidler-Carrie and her team begin to talk about the work and how different portfolios are going to take shape.

1652
03:23:46,531 --> 03:23:49,193
it's gonna, we're gonna sort of see where that capacity is.

1653
03:23:49,593 --> 03:23:54,636
The supervisor of attendance position has some responsibilities that are statutory in nature, and they do have to be attended to.

1654
03:23:55,036 --> 03:23:59,159
So someone on this team will be responsible for doing those pieces of the work.

1655
03:23:59,559 --> 03:24:07,423
We know that within certain school communities, depending on grade level, their engagement or re-engagement challenge can look a little different.

1656
03:24:07,463 --> 03:24:10,105
Sometimes it's a greater emphasis on direct student engagement.

1657
03:24:10,365 --> 03:24:11,606
Sometimes it's family engagement.

1658
03:24:11,806 --> 03:24:15,248
Sometimes the challenges that those students are facing vary depending on age.

1659
03:24:15,641 --> 03:24:22,603
And so thinking about those portfolios, I think is going to help inform us as to how quickly we can scale up.

1660
03:24:22,963 --> 03:24:27,605
But I think generally speaking, three to five is sort of our target goal right now.

1661
03:24:28,025 --> 03:24:29,425
If it works really well, maybe six.

1662
03:24:30,506 --> 03:24:36,568
So tonight, are you asking us to approve the concept without a dollar amount attached?

1663
03:24:36,728 --> 03:24:37,408
I will say this.

1664
03:24:37,768 --> 03:24:39,048
I think the dollar amount is attached.

1665
03:24:39,128 --> 03:24:43,890
And if it's not, we don't anticipate this exceeding $400,000 based on even if we were to go.

1666
03:24:44,740 --> 03:24:47,583
and the high end of 3 to 5 person right.

1667
03:24:48,023 --> 03:25:03,256
I will say that we've done a round of interviews and there are candidates we feel very strong about and so provided that the support that there's no indication that there's not support from the committee we're going to move forward with with bringing those people on board.

1668
03:25:03,657 --> 03:25:12,144
I expect that either your June 14 meeting or a subsequent meeting which are asked to adopt the budget will be a concrete set of estimates budgetary priorities.

1669
03:25:12,951 --> 03:25:18,093
that this will be included within, again, it's gonna be a fraction of the overall ESSER budget.

1670
03:25:18,173 --> 03:25:25,496
And so for that sense, I'm confident we're not gonna have a capacity issue, but certainly as always, we appreciate the committee's support.

1671
03:25:25,516 --> 03:25:33,558
And if you'd like to make a motion endorsing that, that will, something that we will share as we make these job offers to people in the coming days.

1672
03:25:34,759 --> 03:25:40,801
So I make a motion that we move forward with the family engagement

1673
03:25:42,898 --> 03:25:43,378
proposals.

1674
03:25:43,939 --> 03:25:47,943
Motion for approval my second seconded by member Kratz.

1675
03:25:48,523 --> 03:25:49,104
All those in favor.

1676
03:25:49,844 --> 03:25:49,985
Aye.

1677
03:25:50,065 --> 03:25:50,485
Opposed.

1678
03:25:51,006 --> 03:25:51,966
Paper passes.

1679
03:25:52,967 --> 03:25:53,328
Thank you both.

1680
03:25:53,348 --> 03:25:54,509
Thank you very much.

1681
03:25:54,709 --> 03:25:56,531
Thank you very much.

1682
03:25:56,551 --> 03:26:05,439
Before you leave, you mentioned the person responsible for the statutory stuff around attendance.

1683
03:26:06,640 --> 03:26:06,940
Thank you.

1684
03:26:10,759 --> 03:26:15,281
This past year was a very different challenge around attendance.

1685
03:26:16,001 --> 03:26:19,922
You can be in school one period and not the next, or the next.

1686
03:26:21,083 --> 03:26:30,366
We had a lot of letters, not a lot, but a number of parents certainly reached out to me about letters that were coming from our district attorney that were quite threatening, frankly.

1687
03:26:30,606 --> 03:26:31,067
And they are.

1688
03:26:31,147 --> 03:26:34,408
If I got one at home, I would consider it a very significant threat.

1689
03:26:35,268 --> 03:26:40,430
And I realized it was because of the fact the systems did not ever anticipate

1690
03:26:41,505 --> 03:26:43,887
the pandemic and being on Zoom.

1691
03:26:45,188 --> 03:26:55,055
Do those letters happen automatically out of the state-based connections to our attendance system or do we actually have a hand in getting those letters sent from the district attorney?

1692
03:27:01,939 --> 03:27:05,762
To what degree we have discretion over certain pieces of it.

1693
03:27:06,863 --> 03:27:09,585
I am familiar with the actual text and I know

1694
03:27:10,162 --> 03:27:15,103
I'm also familiar with how that's been received, both in this community and elsewhere.

1695
03:27:15,223 --> 03:27:20,744
So I believe there is a regulatory requirement with regard to some of the language.

1696
03:27:21,444 --> 03:27:32,686
But as to the automation component of the generation of those letters and whether or not there might be a better way for us to exercise some discretion is certainly something we could take a look at coming into next year.

1697
03:27:32,726 --> 03:27:37,867
Because as we think about this challenge of reengaging families and students coming

1698
03:27:38,563 --> 03:27:45,005
post-pandemic school year, we are going to have some people that we're trying to find at the beginning of the school year.

1699
03:27:45,425 --> 03:27:53,006
And I think the text that you're referring to is not necessarily going to be the most prudent strategy with respect to bringing them back into the Medford Public Schools community.

1700
03:27:53,066 --> 03:28:02,069
And so for that reason, along with the broader reflection of our values as a district, I think it's something that would be worth taking a look at over the summer.

1701
03:28:02,529 --> 03:28:04,309
Yeah, that'd be great, because you're right.

1702
03:28:04,329 --> 03:28:08,170
The reimagining, which I couldn't be more supportive of,

1703
03:28:08,846 --> 03:28:12,128
It's kind of like, oh, we're all being positive.

1704
03:28:12,168 --> 03:28:16,972
And then there's this like, feels like an officer at the door is going to take you away kind of thing.

1705
03:28:17,052 --> 03:28:22,796
Like what is going, the letter is so stark, not the values we're putting forward.

1706
03:28:23,877 --> 03:28:33,123
And I would say that if we can have a way to, I'm not saying that the regulatory, the statutory requirements are there for, they are what they are.

1707
03:28:34,224 --> 03:28:35,545
But if we can find a way to,

1708
03:28:38,320 --> 03:28:41,561
either soften it or deliver it differently, or we deliver it.

1709
03:28:41,641 --> 03:28:43,442
Or communicate in coordination with it.

1710
03:28:43,502 --> 03:28:52,486
If it's the case that there's a regulatory prescription with regard to the language, I'm confident that there's no prohibition on additional communication.

1711
03:28:53,006 --> 03:28:55,967
And that might be something that we as a district have to take responsibility for.

1712
03:28:56,287 --> 03:28:56,567
Thank you.

1713
03:28:56,828 --> 03:28:57,108
Thank you.

1714
03:29:01,269 --> 03:29:03,530
Motion is on the floor, seconded by Member Kretz.

1715
03:29:06,071 --> 03:29:06,612
I thought you voted.

1716
03:29:09,393 --> 03:29:12,515
We would just take that as even greater stamp of approval, which we really appreciate.

1717
03:29:12,535 --> 03:29:12,995
Great job.

1718
03:29:13,155 --> 03:29:13,435
Yeah.

1719
03:29:13,795 --> 03:29:14,396
Thank you very much.

1720
03:29:14,976 --> 03:29:15,276
Thank you.

1721
03:29:18,037 --> 03:29:24,661
We have next up proposal of dates for school committee meetings is school year 2021-2022.

1722
03:29:25,161 --> 03:29:26,461
Dr. Maurice-Edward Vincent.

1723
03:29:26,942 --> 03:29:29,763
Motion for approval by member Mr. Stone, seconded by member Kratz.

1724
03:29:30,123 --> 03:29:31,244
All those in favor?

1725
03:29:31,544 --> 03:29:31,684
Oh.

1726
03:29:33,205 --> 03:29:33,725
Member Roussell.

1727
03:29:49,658 --> 03:29:49,818
me.

1728
03:29:51,219 --> 03:29:51,599
I'm sorry.

1729
03:29:51,899 --> 03:29:54,041
So I motion to move the November 1 to November 8.

1730
03:29:54,561 --> 03:30:00,165
And I don't really feel strongly about whether November 15 can stay there or not, or whether it should move out.

1731
03:30:00,185 --> 03:30:03,307
Oh, yeah.

1732
03:30:03,767 --> 03:30:04,768
Just just the one.

1733
03:30:05,188 --> 03:30:05,348
Yep.

1734
03:30:05,548 --> 03:30:06,409
8th and 15th then.

1735
03:30:07,449 --> 03:30:11,092
Yeah.

1736
03:30:11,112 --> 03:30:11,612
For a second.

1737
03:30:14,134 --> 03:30:14,594
Okay.

1738
03:30:14,634 --> 03:30:15,515
Your microphone's on.

1739
03:30:15,575 --> 03:30:15,815
Is that?

1740
03:30:15,835 --> 03:30:19,077
All those in favor?

1741
03:30:19,836 --> 03:30:20,497
All those opposed?

1742
03:30:21,277 --> 03:30:22,798
As amended, the motion is passed.

1743
03:30:24,479 --> 03:30:25,840
Do we have any old business?

1744
03:30:26,000 --> 03:30:26,781
I don't believe so.

1745
03:30:29,002 --> 03:30:33,645
Number 10, I believe it's communications.

1746
03:30:36,207 --> 03:30:37,187
And then we have new business.

1747
03:30:37,388 --> 03:30:43,652
Number one is the request for one week extension from the advisory committee to rename the Columbus Elementary School offered by myself.

1748
03:30:45,273 --> 03:30:47,414
I did speak to the chair and they have,

1749
03:30:49,065 --> 03:30:55,392
working extremely hard on a 30-minute presentation plus for us next week, and I know they're putting a lot into it.

1750
03:30:55,432 --> 03:31:01,599
So they're meeting, I believe, Thursday this week to finalize that, and they'll be here next Monday, the 14th.

1751
03:31:02,219 --> 03:31:03,361
Motion to approve.

1752
03:31:03,461 --> 03:31:04,222
Motion to accept.

1753
03:31:04,362 --> 03:31:06,504
Can I suggest a friendly amendment, maybe?

1754
03:31:08,486 --> 03:31:09,908
The additional text would be

1755
03:31:10,847 --> 03:31:24,918
And in light of the fact that the advisory committee has selected their final three names, we will vote on June 14th for the new name, regardless of whether they are able to present to us as anticipated.

1756
03:31:25,579 --> 03:31:26,479
I will, sure.

1757
03:31:26,499 --> 03:31:32,044
The very brief thing here is if they're not ready with a presentation, we're voting on the 14th.

1758
03:31:32,524 --> 03:31:38,028
It goes against our policy, if I may, through the chair, because we did say they could extend up through July 31st.

1759
03:31:39,925 --> 03:31:42,746
I would suggest we watch the meetings to see what's really going on.

1760
03:31:44,226 --> 03:31:45,807
I am watching the meetings.

1761
03:31:46,147 --> 03:31:50,228
I'm not convinced on the 14th of this month or next month they will finish their slides.

1762
03:31:50,728 --> 03:31:54,169
So if you don't want to accept my amendment, that's fine.

1763
03:31:55,589 --> 03:31:58,310
And I can read it again one more time in case you all didn't get it.

1764
03:32:01,428 --> 03:32:10,833
Sure, and in light of the fact that the advisory committee has selected their final three names, we will vote on June 14th for the new name, regardless of whether they are able to present to us as anticipated.

1765
03:32:12,254 --> 03:32:12,814
Member Kretz?

1766
03:32:13,194 --> 03:32:20,918
Yes, I just wanted to say I've been watching some of the meetings on YouTube, and they are working really hard on trying to get the slideshow ready.

1767
03:32:21,579 --> 03:32:25,381
And I just think we need to give them the time.

1768
03:32:25,401 --> 03:32:29,243
I mean, there's many slides that they were going through one by one,

1769
03:32:30,338 --> 03:32:37,683
and they were making decisions on the slides and making the amendments similar to the process that we went through when we had to come up with the policy.

1770
03:32:37,703 --> 03:32:45,728
I really would appreciate that we can give them the time that they're spending to put this presentation together.

1771
03:32:46,168 --> 03:32:49,410
I don't wanna just cut them off in the middle of the work that they're doing.

1772
03:32:49,830 --> 03:32:51,371
They're taking it very seriously.

1773
03:32:51,391 --> 03:32:54,793
They're all very involved and they're taking votes.

1774
03:32:55,113 --> 03:32:59,296
And I would really like to hear their presentation

1775
03:33:00,037 --> 03:33:04,579
And given the time, they're spending a lot of time on the presentation.

1776
03:33:05,619 --> 03:33:07,980
If we could, please give them the additional time.

1777
03:33:08,000 --> 03:33:12,042
I do think that they're going to be ready if they pick the 14th.

1778
03:33:12,122 --> 03:33:18,024
I don't wanna just jump the gun and cut them off in the middle of all the work they've done.

1779
03:33:18,044 --> 03:33:22,706
They've spent so much time, hours and hours on getting the presentation ready.

1780
03:33:23,466 --> 03:33:24,007
Member Hussain.

1781
03:33:24,887 --> 03:33:26,808
I certainly agree that they're spending a lot of time.

1782
03:33:29,133 --> 03:33:30,633
over one hour on one slide.

1783
03:33:30,673 --> 03:33:31,953
They have 30 slides.

1784
03:33:32,774 --> 03:33:35,774
So we will be here next January, perhaps.

1785
03:33:36,354 --> 03:33:39,395
I mean, it's not that they're not putting enough time in.

1786
03:33:39,595 --> 03:33:40,975
This is not questioning that.

1787
03:33:41,475 --> 03:33:56,158
But if all that has to happen in that meeting is that some members of the advisory committee can make it take an hour per slide, it'll be the next election before we're ready to have the meeting.

1788
03:33:56,238 --> 03:33:58,798
So I mean, I've watched the meetings, all of them.

1789
03:33:59,637 --> 03:34:00,157
every minute.

1790
03:34:00,697 --> 03:34:06,740
And what I see is happening is that most of the members are absolutely positively working their butt off to get great slides.

1791
03:34:07,180 --> 03:34:16,844
And I also see people who are not doing that, who seem to be discovering that if we can make an hour per slide the standard, that it's not gonna get done.

1792
03:34:17,324 --> 03:34:21,726
And I don't know what's in their head, but it's an hour.

1793
03:34:21,866 --> 03:34:22,447
I timed it.

1794
03:34:22,567 --> 03:34:23,987
I'm happy to send you the links.

1795
03:34:24,547 --> 03:34:26,528
I timed it, an hour for a slide.

1796
03:34:26,968 --> 03:34:27,849
There are 30 slides.

1797
03:34:29,345 --> 03:34:30,605
They're on slide eight, I believe.

1798
03:34:31,285 --> 03:34:31,526
So.

1799
03:34:31,726 --> 03:34:34,086
If I may, through the chair, I think we give them the benefit of the doubt.

1800
03:34:34,106 --> 03:34:44,228
And if we choose on the 14th to pick a name out of those three, and we choose to do it, that means all of us would be prepared to have read any research that they have available.

1801
03:34:44,489 --> 03:34:54,431
But I'm not prepared to vote to definitely pick a name if they needed another couple of weeks, because we do are going to have potentially one more meeting, short meeting.

1802
03:34:54,491 --> 03:34:56,751
But still, I want to give them that opportunity.

1803
03:34:57,692 --> 03:34:58,052
If I may.

1804
03:34:58,532 --> 03:34:58,992
Member Russo?

1805
03:34:59,382 --> 03:34:59,982
Thank you.

1806
03:35:00,443 --> 03:35:02,604
We can't just decide on the 14th to vote.

1807
03:35:03,204 --> 03:35:04,745
It's not on the agenda to vote.

1808
03:35:06,106 --> 03:35:13,370
So if you come back and say they'd like another extension, one of our options is not to pick a name that night, because that's not on the agenda.

1809
03:35:15,011 --> 03:35:21,735
So tonight is our only opportunity to decide that on the 14th, we will vote for a name.

1810
03:35:23,737 --> 03:35:29,100
If they submit to you and don't give you the presentation and say, I want to be in the agenda, then we're not voting

1811
03:35:30,488 --> 03:35:36,551
we as a committee have no control over when we actually get to vote.

1812
03:35:37,732 --> 03:35:44,215
So and if we don't vote on the 14th, if we don't have any other meetings, obviously, for the summer, then we're talking about September.

1813
03:35:44,535 --> 03:35:57,881
So I just want to make sure that I'm understanding that the implication if there's not, you know, if there if there's a request for another extension or something like that, I want to give the benefit of the doubt to looking forward to the presentation on 14th.

1814
03:35:59,959 --> 03:36:03,561
So I just want to ensure that they have enough time to do the presentation.

1815
03:36:03,681 --> 03:36:05,803
And it seems that they've been working on it for a while.

1816
03:36:05,823 --> 03:36:06,403
So I'm excited.

1817
03:36:06,463 --> 03:36:10,225
It seems three names they should be able to do a presentation for the 14th, which is next week.

1818
03:36:13,668 --> 03:36:15,389
Mayor, could I just get some clarification?

1819
03:36:15,469 --> 03:36:21,593
So next week, the advisory committee is going to present to us.

1820
03:36:22,333 --> 03:36:22,553
Correct.

1821
03:36:22,693 --> 03:36:24,294
And they're going to show us their slideshow.

1822
03:36:25,876 --> 03:36:36,944
we're going to take the vote the same night, or are we going to add another meeting on, because I know that we do have to do one more meeting for the final budget, you know, to accept it.

1823
03:36:38,505 --> 03:36:42,228
I guess I'm looking for some clarification on- That's what we're debating right now.

1824
03:36:42,248 --> 03:36:44,689
I think that's what we're debating right now.

1825
03:36:44,990 --> 03:36:45,170
Okay.

1826
03:36:46,350 --> 03:36:49,873
We're debating member Russo's amendment to vote on it no matter what.

1827
03:36:50,595 --> 03:36:51,275
point of information.

1828
03:36:51,315 --> 03:36:52,515
I'm sorry, I didn't hear miss.

1829
03:36:52,695 --> 03:36:53,736
I didn't hear him through the chair.

1830
03:36:53,756 --> 03:36:54,156
I didn't hear him.

1831
03:36:54,176 --> 03:36:56,396
She's asking a question about next week.

1832
03:36:56,776 --> 03:36:59,737
We're definitely getting the presentation, which is their hope.

1833
03:36:59,877 --> 03:37:03,137
And I know they're working hard on it and that's what they've asked for an extension.

1834
03:37:03,717 --> 03:37:07,498
She's also asking if we're going to be, when we, after we get the presentation, I'm going to be voting on it.

1835
03:37:07,898 --> 03:37:09,638
But that's what I'm, thank you for that.

1836
03:37:09,958 --> 03:37:10,839
I'm trying to understand.

1837
03:37:10,999 --> 03:37:13,559
Are we scheduled for another meeting after the 14th currently?

1838
03:37:14,039 --> 03:37:14,479
Currently?

1839
03:37:14,519 --> 03:37:15,139
No, we're not.

1840
03:37:15,319 --> 03:37:19,280
So very well might need one because of

1841
03:37:20,224 --> 03:37:27,490
you know, the ESSER funding.

1842
03:37:27,630 --> 03:37:32,634
So right now, we are expecting the advisory committee to present on Monday.

1843
03:37:33,815 --> 03:37:38,118
And I thought we were then going to vote after their presentation.

1844
03:37:41,621 --> 03:37:47,705
If they don't come to completion of their, I mean, I think it depends what,

1845
03:37:50,507 --> 03:37:51,528
message we send back.

1846
03:37:52,008 --> 03:38:12,224
If we're saying to them on Monday, we're going to, we'd like you to present whatever you've got, whatever, whatever, however, whatever slideshow they have, wherever they're at, you know, or, or, or we could be more direct and say, we don't need a 30 minute presentation.

1847
03:38:14,325 --> 03:38:18,448
We need, you know, I mean, we want to make sure that there's,

1848
03:38:19,917 --> 03:38:26,238
one or two slides about each name, not necessarily eight slides about one and none about the other.

1849
03:38:27,158 --> 03:38:32,900
So I do think that the direction back to the committee is yes, absolutely.

1850
03:38:34,580 --> 03:38:36,820
We're extending it to June 14th.

1851
03:38:37,641 --> 03:38:42,162
We expect on the 14th that we will hear your presentation.

1852
03:38:43,262 --> 03:38:49,023
Please at your meetings now go forward with the intent of having at least

1853
03:38:49,678 --> 03:38:54,920
you know, a slide about each name, not eight slides about each name, but a slide, you know, something.

1854
03:38:55,820 --> 03:38:56,481
How do we deliver that?

1855
03:38:56,501 --> 03:38:57,581
I like that amendment.

1856
03:38:57,621 --> 03:39:10,146
We can respond to them in the morning that we approve the extension to the 14th, that we'd like a fair presentation, however long that may be on the 14th, because we'd like to take a vote.

1857
03:39:11,147 --> 03:39:11,407
Second.

1858
03:39:13,087 --> 03:39:13,748
Is that your motion?

1859
03:39:14,148 --> 03:39:19,410
Well, that's more the only that, that given that there's limited time,

1860
03:39:20,133 --> 03:39:22,275
And we'd like a fair amount of slides per.

1861
03:39:22,435 --> 03:39:24,396
Right, to give us a concise presentation.

1862
03:39:24,536 --> 03:39:36,505
And that if, I mean, if they need to set up their meeting so that they're going to speak, you know, half an hour on this name, half an hour on this name, and, you know, provide structure to them so that they don't get bogged down on the slide.

1863
03:39:36,705 --> 03:39:41,209
We could also say an even number of slides, and it doesn't have to be lengthy.

1864
03:39:41,649 --> 03:39:41,809
Right.

1865
03:39:42,169 --> 03:39:42,690
It doesn't need.

1866
03:39:43,250 --> 03:39:46,753
Whatever they get to, Thursday night, they get to, and we want them to be presented to.

1867
03:39:47,613 --> 03:39:47,773
OK.

1868
03:39:47,994 --> 03:39:49,695
I'm really looking forward to hearing

1869
03:39:50,128 --> 03:39:50,908
the presentation.

1870
03:39:50,928 --> 03:40:00,833
The motion is on the floor as amended by Member Van de Kloet, seconded by... Can we restate the motion?

1871
03:40:00,853 --> 03:40:01,113
Sorry.

1872
03:40:02,194 --> 03:40:07,456
The motion is request for one week extension from the advisory committee to remain in Columbus School.

1873
03:40:08,216 --> 03:40:17,781
And Member Van de Kloet's amendment is that we send a message to the committee tomorrow that we would like a

1874
03:40:18,329 --> 03:40:32,014
equal amount of slides, however that may be, and whatever is ready at the end of their meeting on Thursday evening to present on the 14th so that we can pick a new name for the Columbus School during that meeting.

1875
03:40:34,094 --> 03:40:34,494
Thank you.

1876
03:40:35,815 --> 03:40:37,595
Their meeting's tomorrow.

1877
03:40:37,715 --> 03:40:38,756
Okay, their meeting tomorrow.

1878
03:40:39,236 --> 03:40:45,098
So that would give them the opportunity to schedule another meeting if they needed it on Thursday or Friday so that they could have it ready for us

1879
03:40:46,911 --> 03:40:48,352
Seconded by member Rousseau.

1880
03:40:48,452 --> 03:40:49,733
Rousseau, all those in favor?

1881
03:40:50,053 --> 03:40:50,413
Aye.

1882
03:40:50,493 --> 03:40:51,193
All those opposed?

1883
03:40:52,274 --> 03:40:53,615
Motion as amended passes.

1884
03:40:55,296 --> 03:41:08,663
Number two, the rules policy and equity subcommittee will propagate a policy on the inclusion of public comments and public participation, emails, letters, and other artifacts within the official minutes of the school committee offered by member Rousseau.

1885
03:41:09,763 --> 03:41:10,024
Thank you.

1886
03:41:13,277 --> 03:41:23,925
I support this very much because as the person now who's charged with reading the letters or the commentary, the question always is, do I have to read word for word?

1887
03:41:24,005 --> 03:41:26,367
What if there's inappropriate language?

1888
03:41:26,447 --> 03:41:31,090
What if there is, you know, three letters as there was tonight all on the same thing?

1889
03:41:32,251 --> 03:41:35,974
It's difficult to understand exactly what we're supposed to be doing.

1890
03:41:36,054 --> 03:41:41,758
So I appreciate that we might develop some guidelines for this.

1891
03:41:42,735 --> 03:41:43,495
motion to approve?

1892
03:41:44,056 --> 03:41:46,037
Can I speak on it for a minute or so?

1893
03:41:46,397 --> 03:41:46,717
Thank you.

1894
03:41:47,477 --> 03:41:49,038
I'm so happy everybody wants me to do it.

1895
03:41:49,218 --> 03:41:49,438
I know.

1896
03:41:49,779 --> 03:41:58,243
I just wanted to say, I've already done some research about our communities and nobody seems to do, just take all the community letters and just stick them into the minutes.

1897
03:41:59,063 --> 03:42:10,549
And I think that it's, the pandemic's been going on, we have certainly received a number of letters, not that many at all, that we should all feel very uncomfortable to have in the official minutes of the meeting.

1898
03:42:11,810 --> 03:42:21,636
that the Medford School Committee in perpetuity, things that member of Andrew Kluge, for instance, would not read out loud and should not read out loud, should not be a part of our permanent record.

1899
03:42:21,696 --> 03:42:24,937
So it sounds like there's already plenty of motions on this.

1900
03:42:25,678 --> 03:42:26,178
So I'll stop talking.

1901
03:42:27,599 --> 03:42:28,419
Is there a second?

1902
03:42:28,800 --> 03:42:29,380
Second, yes.

1903
03:42:29,420 --> 03:42:33,542
A motion by member Graham, seconded by member Russo.

1904
03:42:33,562 --> 03:42:34,763
All those in favor?

1905
03:42:35,183 --> 03:42:35,283
Aye.

1906
03:42:35,724 --> 03:42:36,384
All those opposed?

1907
03:42:37,705 --> 03:42:38,605
Motion is approved.

1908
03:42:38,625 --> 03:42:40,867
Number three, I believe we're going to-

1909
03:42:42,238 --> 03:42:49,220
Move to table number three by member Rousseau, seconded by member Graham.

1910
03:42:49,721 --> 03:42:50,561
All those in favor?

1911
03:42:50,981 --> 03:42:51,141
Aye.

1912
03:42:51,401 --> 03:42:52,141
All those opposed?

1913
03:42:54,242 --> 03:42:55,062
Number three is tabled.

1914
03:42:55,223 --> 03:43:02,185
Number four, resolution on recyclable materials offered by member McStone, the Metro Public School Committee.

1915
03:43:02,905 --> 03:43:03,125
Yes.

1916
03:43:04,386 --> 03:43:06,807
May, just to give a back story.

1917
03:43:07,127 --> 03:43:10,888
So we received a $30,000 recycling grant and as part of the grant,

1918
03:43:11,247 --> 03:43:13,868
It has to be a school committee approved recycling policy.

1919
03:43:14,188 --> 03:43:17,149
So that is a standard policy for the Department of Environmental Protection.

1920
03:43:17,169 --> 03:43:19,009
And I look forward to all supporting it.

1921
03:43:19,209 --> 03:43:21,250
Thank you.

1922
03:43:21,370 --> 03:43:23,531
Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

1923
03:43:23,951 --> 03:43:24,731
All those in favor?

1924
03:43:25,551 --> 03:43:26,292
All those opposed?

1925
03:43:27,092 --> 03:43:28,012
Motion is approved.

1926
03:43:28,792 --> 03:43:29,813
Thank you Member Stone.

1927
03:43:29,833 --> 03:43:36,975
I just wanted to make a motion to send this

1928
03:43:37,549 --> 03:43:44,132
policy to the rules policy and equity subcommittee for some formatting and all the proper stuff to be added in an update.

1929
03:43:44,712 --> 03:43:47,073
Motion by member Rousseau, seconded by member.

1930
03:43:47,533 --> 03:43:47,893
Second.

1931
03:43:48,554 --> 03:43:50,014
McLaughlin, all those in favor?

1932
03:43:50,334 --> 03:43:50,674
Aye.

1933
03:43:50,714 --> 03:43:51,455
All those opposed?

1934
03:43:53,295 --> 03:43:54,256
Motion is approved.

1935
03:43:55,676 --> 03:44:00,258
Number five, MHS vision committee development for school year 2021-2022 offered by myself in conjunction with

1936
03:44:05,048 --> 03:44:11,591
speaking to Dr. Edward Vincent, they'd like to work on a plan throughout the summer and propose that plan in September to get started.

1937
03:44:11,891 --> 03:44:15,532
So asking that we allow administration to do so.

1938
03:44:15,552 --> 03:44:17,873
Member Russo?

1939
03:44:17,893 --> 03:44:24,996
I mean, this is an advisory committee based on the motions we used to create it initially.

1940
03:44:25,096 --> 03:44:31,139
So I don't have any problem with a bunch of work being done ahead of time so we can get the advisory committee set up.

1941
03:44:32,360 --> 03:44:33,300
Hopefully it will not be

1942
03:44:34,073 --> 03:44:41,499
meeting like our last advisory committee set up, but we still do need to do all of the items in our advisory committee policy.

1943
03:44:42,199 --> 03:44:43,380
How long is the service?

1944
03:44:43,581 --> 03:44:44,421
How many members?

1945
03:44:44,942 --> 03:44:46,263
How will they be selected?

1946
03:44:47,143 --> 03:44:48,144
That's policy.

1947
03:44:49,325 --> 03:45:03,016
So I don't have any problem with the administration beginning the work to figure out all of that stuff, but the school committee has the sole authority to constitute an advisory committee

1948
03:45:03,547 --> 03:45:13,975
And so I would support this if the end goal here is that a recommendation from the administration comes on how that will happen, and then we can have our meeting to do it.

1949
03:45:15,115 --> 03:45:19,098
That's kind of what I said, give them time to give us a proposal.

1950
03:45:19,238 --> 03:45:24,722
We'll have a meeting, one of our September meetings, hopefully not September.

1951
03:45:24,762 --> 03:45:30,386
We can shoot for a September meeting to discuss that and move approval and start the process.

1952
03:45:30,626 --> 03:45:30,827
Second.

1953
03:45:30,907 --> 03:45:31,707
I'm sorry.

1954
03:45:33,402 --> 03:45:37,103
So there won't be like picking members or anything going on.

1955
03:45:37,283 --> 03:45:38,484
Okay, thank you.

1956
03:45:39,904 --> 03:45:40,165
Thank you.

1957
03:45:40,445 --> 03:45:46,387
Yeah, I think our admin needs a break to do the work, to do the day-to-day work, okay.

1958
03:45:46,647 --> 03:45:48,528
Was that a motion for approval by?

1959
03:45:48,548 --> 03:45:48,668
Second.

1960
03:45:49,628 --> 03:45:51,989
A motion to approve.

1961
03:45:52,329 --> 03:45:54,790

Aye.

1964
03:45:56,991 --> 03:45:57,691
All those opposed?

1965
03:45:58,532 --> 03:45:59,252
Motion passes.

1966
03:45:59,852 --> 03:46:02,073
Number 12, condolences.

1967
03:46:03,183 --> 03:46:07,667
The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Ralph Scopa.

1968
03:46:08,007 --> 03:46:13,872
Mr. Scopa was the father of former Community Schools Administrative Assistant, Denise Scopa.

1969
03:46:14,973 --> 03:46:20,037
Also, the Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Peter Heining.

1970
03:46:20,557 --> 03:46:25,041
Mr. Heining was the father of Medford School teacher, Mr. Max Heining.

1971
03:46:25,381 --> 03:46:27,883
You all may take a moment of silence.

1972
03:46:36,990 --> 03:46:43,835
