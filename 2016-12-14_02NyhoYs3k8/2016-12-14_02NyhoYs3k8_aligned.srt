1
00:00:07,047 --> 00:00:09,028
Medford City Council will come to order.

2
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:10,829
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:13,290
Present.

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:14,730

10
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:18,812
Yes.

11
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:20,633

12
00:00:21,113 --> 00:00:21,373

16
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:25,875
Present.

17
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:31,357
With seven members present, none absent, please rise and join us in saluting the flag.

18
00:00:32,317 --> 00:00:32,438
Aye.

19
00:00:45,017 --> 00:00:54,008
The chair recognizes Vice President Lengelkern for the suspension of the rules to accept an address from the mayor regarding recent findings of the FAA.

20
00:00:54,468 --> 00:00:55,229
All those in favor?

21
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:56,511
All those opposed?

22
00:00:57,172 --> 00:00:58,133
Welcome to the podium.

23
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,182
The Honorable Stephanie M. Burke, Mayor of Medford.

24
00:01:02,423 --> 00:01:04,304
Good evening, Mr. President and Councillors.

25
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:06,306
Thank you so much for taking me out of order.

26
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:07,207
I really appreciate it.

27
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:17,077
As many of you are aware, last Friday the FAA had a meeting on the noise, the noise issues that we've been having in the city from the low flying planes.

28
00:01:17,477 --> 00:01:22,883
Councilor Lungo Kern was in attendance as well as Councilor Capiello and Mark Rumley, the city solicitor.

29
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:29,731
We all kind of went up, hoping that we would get in, and at the last minute we found out that we did not have clearance to enter the FAA building.

30
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:39,864
We stayed for quite a while, and finally, when Congresswoman Clark appeared, she was able to overrule their rules, which required a 48-hour notice to have someone on the list.

31
00:01:40,405 --> 00:01:46,550
So I was able to attend and sit in on the meeting, which we know impacts several of the neighborhoods throughout Medford.

32
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:52,756
This meeting was put together at the bequest of a state senator that represented the Belmont Watertown area.

33
00:01:53,336 --> 00:02:02,884
So the FAA was just listening to the request, and that's why they held the meeting, and it was scheduled with those parties involved, and the city of Medford really wasn't invited formally.

34
00:02:03,745 --> 00:02:07,849
But I did want to just come back to let you know what transpired during the meeting.

35
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:18,698
Obviously, a lot of the CAC members, Logan has a community board as well as Massport, so the two separate community boards that meet regularly.

36
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:23,182
And several of those members were in attendance during this meeting.

37
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:24,984
They had been previously cleared.

38
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:30,269
So they brought the issues of what they're dealing with as well as we are.

39
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:41,382
We all know firsthand that there's certain sections of the city that have been impacted by the change and basically what the FAA has tried to do is simplify the air

40
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:42,903
travel routes.

41
00:02:43,043 --> 00:02:51,706
So back a year or so ago, a year and a half, the planes were dispersed over multiple cities throughout the Commonwealth.

42
00:02:52,146 --> 00:02:57,928
So when they took off, they were dispersed, so we all dealt with an occasional sound here and there, but nobody was impacted

43
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:00,910
directly all day long with a certain sound.

44
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:09,695
They try to simplify the skies, make travel lanes, and therefore it has brought about the volume that is going over one particular route in the city.

45
00:03:10,435 --> 00:03:13,617
There's actually quite an area over the Malden Hospital.

46
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:20,121
It's where the planes that come off of runway 33L, they actually split, and they go in different directions.

47
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,122
So that particular area gets hit very hard.

48
00:03:23,723 --> 00:03:27,225
And in a lot of the studies that the community groups have done,

49
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:32,688
They're actually looking at the Stearns Ave area as being hit very, very hard in our community.

50
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:37,270
So what we talked to the FAA about was, what are you going to do about it?

51
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,751
We're all dealing with this issue.

52
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:43,314
It's a quality of life issue in our neighborhood and the surrounding communities, and what are you going to do?

53
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:51,838
And they basically told us that they have MIT, Massport has commissioned MIT to do a formal study, but it will not be ready until next fall.

54
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,100
So a year from now, they'll get the results of the sound

55
00:03:55,612 --> 00:03:58,614
testing that they have commissioned through Massport.

56
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:02,177
And of course, we all said that's not good enough.

57
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:04,159
Go back to the way it was.

58
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,200
Do something different.

59
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:08,983
And the FAA's position is that it's all about safety.

60
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:12,666
Their main concern above and beyond sound is safety for

61
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:18,789
the flights, the people on the planes, the pilots, and the workers, and the FAA in general.

62
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:31,256
So they heard our cry for help, and not only is it that there are the numbers that are traveling down these roads in the sky, but the elevation, the volume,

63
00:04:32,624 --> 00:04:36,565
which are two of the main concerns that are also causing havoc in our area.

64
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:38,625
So they listened intently.

65
00:04:39,226 --> 00:04:44,187
They said that they were going to reach out through Massport and try to get some more information quicker.

66
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:54,589
We actually do have a sound study that's part of Massport that's set up in Magoon Thatcher area and that they do not have the results from that yet.

67
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:57,911
So once they get those results, they will be forthcoming to us.

68
00:04:58,472 --> 00:05:05,417
They use a 65 decibel as their magic number, and that's what they've been using as their level that is tolerable.

69
00:05:06,258 --> 00:05:16,485
And so I know what I mentioned to them is that they need to stop looking at things from the sky, and they need to come down to the neighborhoods and see the real impact that it's causing on our citizens.

70
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:35,332
So they did seem to listen, they're heavily on, they want to do constituent service, community involvement, so they vowed to us that they will be having many more community meetings and we're actually going to be working with Senator Markey's office to get a straight Medford meeting, which all of you certainly will be able to attend.

71
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:40,993
So we are working on putting that together in the next couple of weeks so that we can deal with the Medford issues in particular.

72
00:05:41,013 --> 00:05:54,840
And just lastly, I just wanted to mention that today I've named Peter Hook to the Massport CAC community group, and Luke Priessner as the Logan CAC representative, and the backup to Logan will be Peter.

73
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,460
who's on our mass board.

74
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,461
So these two individuals have been very much involved in this process the entire time.

75
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:07,343
They've been outspoken and data-driven and looked at a lot of the facts and circumstances around the area.

76
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:09,423
So I know that they will hit the ground running.

77
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:11,023
They will be invested and involved.

78
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:13,384
It directly impacts their quality of life.

79
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:19,065
So I'm looking forward to them serving on behalf of the city of Medford, and I'm sure that they will do a great job.

80
00:06:19,825 --> 00:06:20,545
So thank you all.

81
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:26,008
I just wanted to give you a verbal update on the Friday meeting, um, so that you're all aware of it as well as the general public.

82
00:06:26,068 --> 00:06:30,069
So we can move forward and try to rectify the issues that are at hand.

83
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,250
Thank you very much.

84
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,330
Thank you, Your Honor.

85
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:34,631
If I may, Madam Vice President.

86
00:06:34,711 --> 00:06:36,212
Thank you, President De La Russo.

87
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:41,394
And thank you, Mayor Burke, um, not only for coming to give us an update tonight, but also for being there on Friday.

88
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:47,837
Um, it was unfortunate Rick and I weren't allowed in, but we were happy that at least our state delegation and you were there to represent the city.

89
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:53,871
The question I have is with regards to this vote that was supposed to be taking place in Boston in December.

90
00:06:54,271 --> 00:07:00,572
Now, is that still going to be taking place with regards to rerouting the Milton air traffic over Medford, or is that something?

91
00:07:00,592 --> 00:07:07,353
It didn't sound like from the FAA that they were taking any actions immediate, because they're waiting on this MIT study to determine everything.

92
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:14,494
They said, basically, they can't just look at our runway in particular, because our runway impacts every other runway.

93
00:07:14,554 --> 00:07:17,115
So if they ought to alter the routes in our area,

94
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:24,557
It's like a domino effect, it impacts every other route that affects Milton, the North Shore, the South Shore.

95
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:32,438
So it didn't sound like they will be taking action, but I believe that that's a Massport meeting, so these gentlemen will be in attendance.

96
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:42,021
So the members of, people from the FAA will be at the Massport meeting, and so we don't know 100% if this vote is gonna take place or not, but you don't believe so?

97
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,841
FAA controls the sky lanes.

98
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,842
Massport controls the time that the planes can run,

99
00:07:48,088 --> 00:07:52,229
how many can go up, how frequent that they can be dispersed out of Logan.

100
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,631
So it's funny when you bring up certain issues to FAA, they say, well, that's not really it.

101
00:07:57,691 --> 00:07:58,872
We just tell them where they can go.

102
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:02,293
We don't tell them when they can go and how many can go, the frequency.

103
00:08:03,213 --> 00:08:07,995
But certainly, if they're all going and they're all going down a certain route, we're impacted.

104
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:10,456
So they heard us loud and clear.

105
00:08:10,516 --> 00:08:16,438
So I would doubt very much that they're going to do anything that's going to impact a particular area, especially until the study's done.

106
00:08:17,532 --> 00:08:21,534
And then you said the fall of 2017, all of 17, which is astounding.

107
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:22,955
Okay.

108
00:08:23,495 --> 00:08:23,835
Thank you.

109
00:08:23,935 --> 00:08:24,255
Thank you.

110
00:08:24,615 --> 00:08:25,456
Thank you very much.

111
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:28,497
Madam mayor for your presence and a happy Thanksgiving.

112
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:29,278
Thank you.

113
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:32,699
Enjoy your family and enjoy your meal.

114
00:08:32,819 --> 00:08:33,180
Thank you.

115
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,160
Thank you, Mr. Pratt.

116
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,362
Just had a quick question, madam mayor, if you wouldn't mind.

117
00:08:38,122 --> 00:08:46,446
Um, it was reported in, uh, the transcript just the other day that, uh, there hasn't been a member of, uh, an appointed member of,

118
00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:55,028
uh, this community that has attended any of the CAC meetings, the Logan airport, uh, community advisory meetings, uh, in the last two and a half years.

119
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:05,759
And I was wondering if we can get any feedback, why the appointed members haven't shown up, why the city of method doesn't have a voice at the table when many of these issues are brought up.

120
00:09:06,393 --> 00:09:10,835
discussing runways and discussing other issues that impact our community.

121
00:09:10,995 --> 00:09:14,116
We did have a Massport representative that attended some of the meetings.

122
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:19,679
Unfortunately, they've canceled several of the last few months based upon not having enough information.

123
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:22,460
So we did have a representative that was at those meetings.

124
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:30,564
The original Logan CAC was established many, many years ago, and it was for sound, really, looking at the sound lanes.

125
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:36,666
And then the Massport CAC kicked in that looks at everything, all the operations of Massport.

126
00:09:36,686 --> 00:09:39,087
So we do have a Massport CAC.

127
00:09:39,247 --> 00:09:44,589
As you're aware, I just named some new bodies to that so that we will have full activity on that commission.

128
00:09:45,609 --> 00:09:54,293
Right, but I'm specifically talking about the Logan Airport, which that board has an appointed member by the mayor, the past mayor and yourself, correct?

129
00:09:54,953 --> 00:09:56,654
It has an appointment and it has a...

130
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,387
an alternate as well.

131
00:09:58,487 --> 00:09:58,687
Right.

132
00:09:59,468 --> 00:10:05,032
That's the particular board that I'm talking about that hasn't been represented by this community in two and a half years.

133
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:09,173
I can't go back prior to the year, the 10 months.

134
00:10:09,494 --> 00:10:18,197
I can only look at the 10 months and I wasn't aware that Logan, I don't even know if Logan has had a meeting, but Massport has had meetings over the last several months.

135
00:10:18,237 --> 00:10:20,278
Massport has had several meetings as well.

136
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:29,061
And so has Logan, just so you know, they've had several meetings and our representative for whatever reason, maybe one wasn't appointed or it was an in between time.

137
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:35,264
Uh, but, uh, we haven't had a representative on that board speaking on behalf of the residents of this community.

138
00:10:35,722 --> 00:10:42,650
in two and a half years over a dozen meetings that we have failed to go to the table and at least have our opinions voice.

139
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:55,164
So maybe, um, at some point it'd be nice to have a check and balance that we know when we appoint people, even this council, we appoint people, not as many as the mayor's office, but we appoint people to boards of commissions as well.

140
00:10:55,668 --> 00:11:03,771
And it might be a good idea or it might be a good policy, Mr. President, to make sure that our representatives are truly attending these particular meetings.

141
00:11:04,251 --> 00:11:15,575
And maybe there should be some type of policy devised that would encourage maybe some type of sign-in or allow us to know if our representatives are truly making these meetings.

142
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:20,537
Well, I've actually read the Mass Support and the Logan, their enabling legislation.

143
00:11:21,337 --> 00:11:27,103
And they're supposed to be in attendance, and if they miss a few, I think it's three meetings in one case, they're different between the two.

144
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:31,468
They're supposed to notify the appointing authority that someone is not going to these meetings.

145
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:37,595
So if they're not, if they were not notifying, obviously they didn't notify me, or I would have taken action.

146
00:11:38,176 --> 00:11:38,936
before tonight.

147
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:41,778
So going forward, we're going to check.

148
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:44,339
We'll get a monthly report from the meetings themselves.

149
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:47,080
These individuals are very active in the community.

150
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,181
They're very active with this particular issue.

151
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:54,963
So I know that they will make us very proud and we'll be reflecting our interests there as well.

On motion of Councilor Scott Pelley to return to the regular order business.

227
00:15:49,394 --> 00:15:50,135
All those in favor?

228
00:15:50,655 --> 00:15:51,375
All those opposed?

229
00:15:55,697 --> 00:15:57,158
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

230
00:15:59,991 --> 00:16:24,319
16-765, authored by Vice President Laura Kern, Councilors Falco and Scott Kelly, to be resolved that the Metric City Council respectfully request that the City Solicitor's Office inquire with the Attorney General's Office about the sale of the Malden Hospital site and render an opinion as to whether it was subject to review by the AG's office as it was a non-profit being sold to a private entity.

231
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,941
If the hospital is still considered acute care, it should be subject to the AG's inquiry.

232
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:38,291
The chair will recognize at this time Chairman Falco of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Malden Hospital site.

233
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:46,933
I appointed you as chair to amass a committee and the committee members to examine the situation up there.

234
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:47,693
Counselor.

235
00:16:48,113 --> 00:16:49,313
Thank you, Mr. President.

236
00:16:50,214 --> 00:16:56,015
So we met last Tuesday night in a subcommittee meeting, myself, vice president,

237
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:58,764
Mungo Kerner and a counselor, Scott Pelly.

238
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:06,487
And we met with, um, the friends of Fellsmere Heights and actually the method police department as well to talk about, uh, any type of traffic issues.

239
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,548
And, uh, it was a good discussion.

240
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:13,790
Uh, uh, friends of Fellsmere Heights laid out their plan for what they would like to see in that area.

241
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:19,893
Um, yeah, in a, in contrast to what the developer is actually proposing.

242
00:17:20,353 --> 00:17:21,814
And during that conversation, uh, uh,

243
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:32,658
actually a mass general law came up, uh, chapter one 80 section eight a concerning, uh, sale, lease, and exchange of nonprofits, uh, corporations assets.

244
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:46,246
And, um, what this involves is basically, uh, it, it, it involves a charitable corporation planning to dispose of its assets, uh, must notify the attorney general within 30 days before doing so.

245
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:50,008
And, uh, it goes, the law goes on to state that, um,

246
00:17:51,138 --> 00:18:14,653
And it was actually updated in July 21st of 2000 that it requires a non-profit acute care hospital or health maintenance organization to give 90 days notice to the Attorney General and the Commissioner of Public Health before the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of substantial amount of its assets with a personal entity other than the public charity.

247
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:23,393
Following receipt of the notice, the AG, the Attorney General's Office is to investigate and or hold a public hearing.

248
00:18:24,134 --> 00:18:31,817
And so the Friends of Fellsmere Heights actually, back in 2015, inquired about this with the Attorney General's Office.

249
00:18:32,537 --> 00:18:35,139
And the Attorney General's Office actually

250
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:48,936
basically came back saying that this doesn't apply because they ruled that Hallmark Health is not a acute care facility or an HMO, a health maintenance organization.

251
00:18:49,036 --> 00:18:51,498
So they basically turned it down.

252
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,904
And there seems to be a lot of doubt as to whether or not they should have done that because

253
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,431
you know, why is the law there in the first place?

254
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:09,138
Um, you know, it hasn't been used in a hospital for a while, but I mean, technically it's still on the Malvern hospital is still owned by hallmark health.

255
00:19:09,539 --> 00:19:12,141
It's still, uh, listed as an asset on their books.

256
00:19:12,641 --> 00:19:15,824
So we really should be considered as part of the hospital.

257
00:19:16,444 --> 00:19:25,832
Um, so we would like the city solicitor, uh, to actually look into this a little bit further and, uh, give us an opinion as to whether or not, um, probably the,

258
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,933
whether or not we should inquire with the Attorney General on this issue.

259
00:19:31,094 --> 00:19:41,562
Really, I mean, it definitely seems odd that the law is there, but the Attorney General's office really isn't following through with it, from what we could tell.

260
00:19:42,483 --> 00:19:55,473
So we'd like City Solicitor Rumley to look into this, offer us an opinion, and I'm sure my council colleagues would definitely like to speak on this as well, but we felt that this should be looked into further.

261
00:19:56,188 --> 00:19:56,909
Thank you council.

262
00:19:57,449 --> 00:19:58,230
Madam vice president.

263
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:58,890
Thank you.

264
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,131
I'm president Delaware.

265
00:20:00,171 --> 00:20:08,918
So I think John gave a good synopsis of, you know, the law and what it entails and what it, what it was, the purpose was.

266
00:20:08,938 --> 00:20:12,701
Um, and I think it's really important that the, the city look into it.

267
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:21,087
We, we do own three acres of that property and there is a developer who has a proposal that's obviously scaled down from their last proposal.

268
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:25,050
We also have the group, the friends of the Felsmere Heights who, who have a,

269
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:32,620
almost a better proposal, obviously less dense, um, less units and more open space.

270
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,742
So it's something that we want to push and, um, advocate for.

271
00:20:36,422 --> 00:20:47,729
And we would love the attorney general's help to oversee this because the intent of the law is to figure out for this five, I guess, reasons why the law was put in place.

272
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:54,834
But for Medford it's important because it, it will help figure out whether the proposed transaction is in the best is in the public's interests.

273
00:20:55,281 --> 00:21:23,539
And I think that's something we would love to have the Attorney General review with the help of being pushed, obviously, by our city solicitor, Mark Rumley, because when the, back in September, September, October of 2015, there was a group of people that did ask the Attorney General's office for some help, and they ruled that it wasn't acute care, you know, mainly, I think, because it was closed down, it was closed down in 2000, but that's truly not the intent of the law.

274
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:24,560
I think if you're gonna,

275
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:33,251
any acute care facility that wants to get around Chapter 180 would just close down and sell a month or two or 10, 15 years later.

276
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:43,773
Where in this, you know, the intent of the law is to make sure that the public's interests are taken into account, whether you're closed, no matter when you're closed.

277
00:21:43,933 --> 00:21:45,434
It's the fact that it was a hospital.

278
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:50,835
It was owned by Malden Healthcare and then sold to Hallmark Health.

279
00:21:51,326 --> 00:22:01,273
So we want to ask the city solicitor to advocate on Medford's behalf, on obviously the behalf of the friends of Felsmere Heights and all the residents who are affected by this location.

280
00:22:01,673 --> 00:22:13,461
We want to ask that the AG do investigate and do look into this parcel and do render an opinion and create an atmosphere where there is a public hearing, which I think is going to be extremely beneficial in the long run.

281
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,184
So I do respectfully ask that our city solicitor look into this.

282
00:22:17,304 --> 00:22:20,366
There is a letter that was drafted

283
00:22:20,776 --> 00:22:27,161
to the AG's office, September 14th, 2015, that we'd probably like to give to our solicitor.

284
00:22:27,641 --> 00:22:41,872
We have hard copies and I think we've all been emailed the letter and that will be a good starting point and I think Mark and his office would do a great job advocating for the community and hopefully get the attention of the AG, which the friends haven't been able to do yet.

285
00:22:41,992 --> 00:22:49,858
And I think coming from, obviously, with the mayor's support and our AG's, our city solicitor's office, it would go a long way.

286
00:22:50,483 --> 00:22:59,806
So if you would kindly Madam Vice President, uh, give a copy of that letter to the, uh, city messenger so he can convey it, uh, to the, uh, city solicitor's office.

287
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:01,927
Uh, the chair recognizes council night.

288
00:23:02,947 --> 00:23:03,627
Um, Mr. President.

289
00:23:03,647 --> 00:23:14,491
So as I understand this, the question that we're asking the city solicitor at this point in time would be, does chapter 180 of the Massachusetts general laws apply regarding the sale and redevelopment of the Malden hospital site?

290
00:23:17,992 --> 00:23:18,152
Yes.

291
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:20,479
Move approval, Mr. President.

292
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,281
On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.

293
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:25,323
Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Pelley.

294
00:23:25,723 --> 00:23:28,605
If I can, thank you, Mr. President.

295
00:23:29,026 --> 00:23:46,999
I will not repeat what Councilor Fowle and Councilor Lungo-Kern have already expressed, but I think again, this is so important for the constituents and especially the Fulton Heights area because the realization is coming closer and we need to make sure that

296
00:23:47,507 --> 00:24:00,751
We overturn every rock and we investigate every possible concern and issue that if that is developed for what they intend to develop in that area, the major impact is not going to be on Malden.

297
00:24:00,771 --> 00:24:01,891
It's not going to be on Melrose.

298
00:24:02,311 --> 00:24:03,792
It'll be in our neighborhoods in Medford.

299
00:24:03,832 --> 00:24:07,953
So I appreciate also wanted to

300
00:24:08,357 --> 00:24:16,141
uh, thank, um, Sergeant, um, hard net for being out and they've already started traffic studies in the area to help us further along.

301
00:24:16,201 --> 00:24:26,106
So we can hold a, I know that one of the questions, make sure the public wanted to reiterate to the public that we're looking to hold a, uh, one of our next meetings at, uh, St.

302
00:24:26,146 --> 00:24:29,968
Francis in that area to make sure more residents can come out and be heard.

303
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,850
So, um, I just want to make sure I've mentioned that.

304
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:34,711
And, uh, thanks for my colleagues for all their work.

305
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:35,071
Thank you.

306
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:35,651
Thank you.

307
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:37,392
Counselor chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

308
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:38,830
Uh, thank you.

309
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:46,497
And I want to thank, uh, the, uh, council president and the members of the ad hoc committee for, uh, their diligence on this matter.

310
00:24:47,077 --> 00:24:51,681
Uh, as we know, this is a very important issue to, uh, neighbors up the heights.

311
00:24:52,522 --> 00:25:01,429
And, uh, if the project was built out in its current capacity, it would have a devastating impact on traffic, uh, as we know it, uh, in that area.

312
00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:04,832
Uh, we also heard tonight from the mayor that the FAA,

313
00:25:05,432 --> 00:25:12,518
is looking to change plane routes on some of the runways that impact this community.

314
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:17,482
And the highest impact will be to the heights and to Wellington.

315
00:25:17,822 --> 00:25:18,563
So think about it.

316
00:25:18,623 --> 00:25:27,891
Think about if this project that we're talking about were to go through with the additional traffic, road traffic, and think about if the runway to go through with the additional air traffic

317
00:25:28,591 --> 00:25:32,296
we may have a mass exodus out of certain parts of our community.

318
00:25:32,856 --> 00:25:39,204
And I think we have to be very diligent and persistent on these issues and shake every tree possible.

319
00:25:39,594 --> 00:25:53,345
And I think this is a great recommendation that's being offered tonight to have the city solicitor offer an opinion and then to go towards the Attorney General's office and have the Attorney General's office at least give some guidance on the issue.

320
00:25:54,006 --> 00:25:55,827
And I agree with Councilor Longo-Kern.

321
00:25:56,748 --> 00:26:08,938
The possibility of having a public hearing that involves both communities united, I think would be extremely helpful, Mr. President, in making sure that this area is addressed in a way that

322
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:11,575
doesn't impact the quality of life in our community.

323
00:26:12,215 --> 00:26:13,316
We're not against building.

324
00:26:13,696 --> 00:26:17,677
I don't think anyone's against building, at least in this council or in this community.

325
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:21,759
But we want sensible approach to building in this community.

326
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:29,122
We want a sensible approach to neighborhoods that have existed for over 100 years, Mr. President.

327
00:26:29,742 --> 00:26:31,923
And we want to be mindful of that fact.

328
00:26:32,343 --> 00:26:37,685
So I support this wholeheartedly and thank the ad hoc committee for their

329
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:39,904
efforts on this matter.

330
00:26:40,845 --> 00:26:44,405
On the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco.

331
00:26:44,866 --> 00:26:45,646
All those in favor?

332
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:46,146
Aye.

333
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:46,846
All those opposed?

334
00:26:47,226 --> 00:26:47,926
Motion carries.

335
00:26:47,966 --> 00:26:50,327
Reports of committees, 16-766.

336
00:26:50,827 --> 00:27:00,889
Report of the Committee of the Whole meeting held November 15, 2016 in room 207, Council Office, Medford City Hall, regarding the Ordinance for Community Preservation Act.

337
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,010
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

338
00:27:03,985 --> 00:27:05,946
Uh, Mr. President, thank you very much in our packets.

339
00:27:06,286 --> 00:27:13,030
And, um, following last week's committee of the whole, we had a discussion relative to the establishment of the community preservation committee.

340
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:19,634
Uh, the community preservation committee is required, um, with the passage of the community preservation act.

341
00:27:19,994 --> 00:27:23,716
And, um, as we are all aware, the community preservation act passed about a year ago.

342
00:27:23,736 --> 00:27:33,121
Um, president Della Russo appointed an ad hoc committee on the implementation of the community preservation act for the city of Medford consisting of myself, counselors,

343
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:38,866
Falco and Scarpelli as well as Alicia hunt from the office of energy and environment.

344
00:27:39,346 --> 00:27:45,968
Roberta Cameron and Joan Sear were citizen representatives and attorney Rumley served as legal counsel for the subcommittee.

345
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:51,409
And, um, the subcommittee came up with a series of recommendations after about a year of deliberation.

346
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:52,049
Mr. President.

347
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:57,411
Um, we met at the committee of the whole and we went over these recommendations.

348
00:27:57,491 --> 00:28:02,852
The committee of the whole voted to send the recommendations to the city solicitor to establish a draft ordinance.

349
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:08,958
The draft ordinance was presented to the council last week before our regularly scheduled Medford city council meeting.

350
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:11,439
And it was, uh, adopted favorably.

351
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:21,901
Mr. President, this paper right here is the product of the work of the subcommittee and the, uh, review and the, um, analysis of the Memphis city council.

352
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:24,502
And I would move for approval for a first reading on it this evening.

353
00:28:24,522 --> 00:28:30,663
Mr. President, it's our duty as the Memphis city council to establish the community preservation commission to

354
00:28:32,353 --> 00:28:34,934
execute the functions of the Community Preservation Act.

355
00:28:34,994 --> 00:28:40,617
It's required by law, and this would be the first step in us becoming in compliance with the passage of the Community Preservation Act, Mr. President.

356
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,598
In fact, we received the primary draft sometime in the summer, at the end of the summer, if I remember.

357
00:28:44,718 --> 00:28:45,219
Yes, we did.

358
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:50,041
We had made some recommendations, and those were sent as well to the city solicitor for the draft.

359
00:28:50,761 --> 00:28:52,802
A couple of recommendations came out of last

360
00:28:53,462 --> 00:29:02,124
uh, week's meeting, uh, they were incorporated into this final draft, uh, which, uh, was motioned, uh, favorably out of the committee hall.

361
00:29:02,164 --> 00:29:07,165
So on the motion for approval by counselor night, the citizen wishes to speak.

362
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:07,625
Good evening.

363
00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:08,365
Welcome.

364
00:29:08,405 --> 00:29:10,666
And please state your name and address for the record.

365
00:29:11,086 --> 00:29:11,446
Thank you.

366
00:29:11,526 --> 00:29:14,286
Uh, Andrew Castaneda, Cushing street method mass.

367
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:18,027
Um, thank you honorable council for the time.

368
00:29:18,667 --> 00:29:19,347
Appreciate it.

369
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:22,768
And I wish you an early Thanksgiving for all.

370
00:29:23,366 --> 00:29:28,811
a good thanks for all the good things in the world and the time we have left on earth to make things better.

371
00:29:30,492 --> 00:29:39,421
On the CPA, I believe it was voted in by the voters by a slim margin, and it sounds wonderful.

372
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:47,187
My only request would be is on this ordinance that you're about to pass to add an addendum that would

373
00:29:50,136 --> 00:30:04,560
publicly publish in the method transcript or whatever newspaper would be in the future at the deadline of all the requests and ideas that come forth from the entire city population.

374
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:13,342
Therefore, I believe we as a people could make a better decision as to get a better bang for our investment.

375
00:30:14,323 --> 00:30:19,324
I believe I would like to see an amendment added to the

376
00:30:20,498 --> 00:30:21,178
documents.

377
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:30,401
So the city would indeed publish all the ideas for future reference.

378
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,883
So we, the people can make better decisions, hopefully, and not just the mayor.

379
00:30:35,363 --> 00:30:36,223
Thank you for listening.

380
00:30:36,423 --> 00:30:37,044
Thank you, sir.

381
00:30:38,224 --> 00:30:40,925
On the motion for approval, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

382
00:30:44,206 --> 00:30:46,927
Councilor Caviello.

383
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:47,067
Yes.

384
00:30:47,914 --> 00:30:48,635
Councilor Falco?

385
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:49,235
Yes.

386
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:50,216
Councilor Night?

387
00:30:50,396 --> 00:30:50,676
Yes.

388
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:51,997
Vice President Long-Term?

389
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:52,697
Yes.

390
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:53,538
Councilor Marks?

391
00:30:53,838 --> 00:30:54,058
Yes.

392
00:30:54,579 --> 00:30:55,339
Councilor Scarpelli?

393
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:55,700
Yes.

394
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,040
President Del Rosso?

395
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:57,341
Yes.

396
00:30:57,421 --> 00:31:03,145
With a vote of seven, the affirmative, none in the negative, the ordinance passes its first reading.

397
00:31:04,168 --> 00:31:04,648
Counselor Knight.

398
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,790
Um, Mr. President, thank you very much.

399
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:12,773
Um, I had the pleasure of chairing this subcommittee and I'd just like to thank the members, um, that served on it with me.

400
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:19,337
Counselor Scott Pelly, counselor Falco, um, Alicia hunt from the office of energy and environment and Roberta Cameron and Jones here.

401
00:31:19,537 --> 00:31:24,640
Um, we met probably 15 times at least on this.

402
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:32,525
Um, everybody was very committed and diligent in their efforts and um, it was a pleasure working with them and I just wanted to thank them for their efforts and be sure that they were recognized for their hard work.

403
00:31:32,545 --> 00:31:32,985
Mr. President.

404
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:34,709
Thank you, Councilor.

405
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:40,893
On the motion of Councilor Knight for suspension of the rules to take papers under suspension and in the hand of the clerk.

406
00:31:40,953 --> 00:31:41,733
All those in favor?

407
00:31:41,753 --> 00:31:42,013
Aye.

408
00:31:42,293 --> 00:31:43,054
All those opposed?

409
00:31:43,674 --> 00:31:44,595
Motion granted.

410
00:31:44,615 --> 00:31:57,962
16-770 offered by Councilors Knight and Scarpelli is resolved that the Metro City Council express its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Denise Bates on her recent passing.

411
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:06,973
Please join us for a moment of silence if councillors would please stand.

412
00:32:24,189 --> 00:32:27,672
Offered by Councillor Knight, 16-7969.

413
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:29,914
Offered by Councillor Knight, be it resolved

414
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:37,528
that the city administration provide the council with a presentation regarding the proposed Clippership Connector Project.

415
00:32:37,728 --> 00:32:38,228
Councilor Knight.

416
00:32:38,648 --> 00:32:39,949
Mr. President, thank you very much.

417
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:57,721
Back in June, this council approved a paper that I sponsored relative to extending a community path from where the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden is located to Hormel Stadium and then from Hormel Stadium to McDonald Park, ultimately creating a community path that would link in those three

418
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,842
amenities that we have here and offer here in our community.

419
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:04,525
Um, it's been brought to my attention that this project is moving forward.

420
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:16,176
Uh, the department of conservation and recreation in collaboration with the Massachusetts highway department has been, um, proposing the development and construction of this plan.

421
00:33:16,677 --> 00:33:18,478
Um, however, there've been some changes to the plan.

422
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:22,442
Um, recently the office of energy and environment held a community meeting.

423
00:33:22,482 --> 00:33:23,503
I was unable to attend it,

424
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:42,834
However, I did receive some feedback from a number of abutters to the community path that expressed some concern and I'd ask that the administration provide the council with a brief presentation as to the proposal for the creation of the Clippership Connector, Mr. President, what it entails, and give these residents in the community an opportunity to hear it once again and raise their issues, concerns, and questions.

425
00:33:43,794 --> 00:33:45,215
On that motion, Councilor Caviello.

426
00:33:45,395 --> 00:33:46,136
Thank you, Mr. President.

427
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:52,819
Mr. President, I did have the opportunity to attend that meeting that evening and it was very well attended at the Riverside Yacht Club.

428
00:33:54,133 --> 00:34:00,515
Some of the concerns that the neighbors had brought up were that the path was going to be too close to their homes.

429
00:34:01,136 --> 00:34:07,738
And they had some, that was, I think that was the biggest concern, but there was also, there was a good amount of neighbors also in favor of it.

430
00:34:08,238 --> 00:34:10,619
So I think it was a very good presentation.

431
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:21,644
There was a member, someone there from the DCI was there on hand and Alicia Hunt was there and someone from, I think the, I think there was the river association was there.

432
00:34:22,024 --> 00:34:22,164
So,

433
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,262
I agree with council and it'd be nice for the, for the council to see what was going on there.

434
00:34:27,103 --> 00:34:36,009
Um, because they, I know, I know there is some, uh, objections by some of the neighbors, uh, on what's going to be happening there, but it does look like a worthwhile project.

435
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:36,510
Mr. President.

436
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:37,190
Very good.

437
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,692
A motion for approval by councilor night.

438
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:44,075
Seconded by a council caveo chair recognizes the citizen at the podium.

439
00:34:44,315 --> 00:34:44,555
Thank you.

440
00:34:44,575 --> 00:34:47,397
Cost of the Lord was for Andrew cast and Eddie Cushman street, Medford mass.

441
00:34:47,858 --> 00:34:49,559
Thank you for allowing me to speak again.

442
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:49,619
Um,

443
00:34:52,034 --> 00:35:08,097
I think Councilor Knight brought up a great idea to have the community bike path from Crystal Campbell, the Marathon Monument towards Somerville.

444
00:35:08,117 --> 00:35:11,517
As other parts of our city along the Mystic River has.

445
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:19,419
If I'm not mistaken, one of my various employment opportunities was real estate.

446
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:21,179
I believe the people

447
00:35:22,035 --> 00:35:28,818
have the right within, I believe it's 20 feet of mean high tide.

448
00:35:29,278 --> 00:35:41,722
Don't quote me, but it's been a Supreme Court ruling that the people own the rights from mean high tide, I believe, to 20 feet on the shore, on the land.

449
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:48,645
And furthermore, when people or persons or entities bought condominiums,

450
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,131
or built yard clubs.

451
00:35:55,032 --> 00:36:00,376
I'm sure that's deeded, the Cambridge Clerk of Deeds for Real Estate, and they know that.

452
00:36:01,036 --> 00:36:03,838
Whether they've been cutting the grass or not, that's their prerogative.

453
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:15,104
However, we the people in the United States of America own so many feet from mean high tide on beach or soil, whatever it is.

454
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:19,107
I would like to see it happen for the benefit of we the people.

455
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:21,493
I really emphasize this.

456
00:36:21,593 --> 00:36:22,734
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

457
00:36:23,154 --> 00:36:24,034
I'm very impressed.

458
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:26,535
It should happen.

459
00:36:28,915 --> 00:36:31,536
It must happen if we have a democracy.

460
00:36:32,216 --> 00:36:33,116
Thank you for listening.

461
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:35,757
On that motion, all those in favor?

462
00:36:36,377 --> 00:36:37,097
All those opposed?

463
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:37,977
Motion carries.

464
00:36:38,017 --> 00:36:39,298
Offered by Councilor Scott Peli.

465
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:47,180
Be it resolved that the City Council update and discuss the MBTA bus stop at Main and High Street and questions on bus stop wait time.

466
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,040
Chair recognizes Councilor Scott Peli.

467
00:36:49,478 --> 00:36:50,338
Thank you, Mr. President.

468
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:56,322
Uh, just briefly, I just wanted to give, uh, my fellow counselors and our constituents an update.

469
00:36:56,502 --> 00:37:13,971
Um, today, um, I know we've, we requested for the department of transportation and, uh, the MBTA to look at the bus stop over at high street in Maine and ask that it be temporarily, um, closed due to the construction concerns.

470
00:37:14,251 --> 00:37:14,331
Um,

471
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:16,515
It hasn't happened.

472
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:24,120
Today, I did drive by, and what I witnessed is something that I think is a very, very dangerous situation.

473
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:43,454
They had barrels along the right lane, along the sidewalk, closing that area for the buses to get to the sidewalk, and buses stopping in the left lane to let riders walk up to that bus.

474
00:37:44,374 --> 00:37:45,015
Not only did I see

475
00:37:45,881 --> 00:38:00,093
I found concerns in the people walking off the curb and walking across an open street, but I found the way the bus was stopping, it really lent some safety concerns for pedestrians and the crosswalk behind them on high street.

476
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:14,805
So I requested that, um, I'd like, I would request that we, we reach out to, um, uh, the MBTA department of, uh, the DOT to, um, call for a subcommittee with transportation and, uh,

477
00:38:15,347 --> 00:38:18,008
visit and question these concerns.

478
00:38:18,188 --> 00:38:28,332
Uh, the, the feedback I got back today was that, uh, that, that stop, if it was closed for a long period of time, it would lose his grandfather clause for ADA accessibility.

479
00:38:28,912 --> 00:38:33,774
And then if would be brought back in the future, it would, we would have to redesign the whole sidewalk.

480
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:40,277
So that was something we never, we'd never heard in multiple meetings with, uh, their, their, um,

481
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,904
their group and it bothers bothers me that they said that they did say that.

482
00:38:46,944 --> 00:38:52,008
So if I've talked to my fellow, uh, members of our committee and that's never been said.

483
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:54,810
So we want to make sure that the, they're hearing us.

484
00:38:55,271 --> 00:39:06,440
Um, and, uh, another concern I had from a constituent was, um, a concern that I'd like to talk, uh, and address with them is the, the wait period, especially with the cold weather coming.

485
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:15,203
uh, the, the amount of time that people are waiting, uh, at some of our bus stops, uh, here in the city and maybe bring that to light.

486
00:39:15,383 --> 00:39:22,974
And, um, I welcome any constituent to call me and, uh, if they're having any direct concerns at their stop, so we can bring those directly.

487
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:23,335
I know I have,

488
00:39:23,758 --> 00:39:27,060
had a few, but if there are more out there, I'd like to bring that forward.

489
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,722
So if we can, we can with, um, city clerk set up that meeting.

490
00:39:31,742 --> 00:39:38,205
Uh, if we can sit together and find a neutral time with that organization, it'd be great.

491
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:39,906
And the subcommittee on transportation.

492
00:39:40,587 --> 00:39:41,007
Correct.

493
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:45,609
That motion, all those in favor, all those opposed carries off by council marks.

494
00:39:46,149 --> 00:39:53,013
Be resolved that the light post pedestrian walk sign in front of whole foods, which was knocked down last Saturday, be replaced.

495
00:39:53,533 --> 00:39:59,458
by the Department of Conservation and Recreation in the interest of public safety council.

496
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:01,419
Thank you, Mr. President.

497
00:40:01,439 --> 00:40:09,125
Uh, this particular, uh, pedestrian walk signal, uh, serves for a lot of pedestrians who would like to cross over to go to Whole Foods.

498
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:14,129
And, uh, right now there is no light there that, uh, stops traffic.

499
00:40:14,789 --> 00:40:18,092
And so I asked that we send a paper immediately to DCR,

500
00:40:18,612 --> 00:40:29,259
and also our state delegation for any assistance they can provide in getting this particular pedestrian walk signal posted back immediately in the interest of public safety.

501
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:35,523
So if you would send that to Senator Jaylund and Representative Goppely who represents that district.

502
00:40:36,084 --> 00:40:37,565
On the motion, all those in favor?

503
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:38,705
All those opposed?

504
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:39,466
Motion carries.

505
00:40:39,566 --> 00:40:40,607
Offered by Councilor Marks.

506
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:44,709
Be it resolved that the city employee's secondary insurance be discussed.

507
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:45,690
Councilor Marks.

508
00:40:47,073 --> 00:40:48,094
Thank you, Mr. President.

509
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:55,958
As we're probably all aware, or may not be aware, city employees are entitled to health insurance as an employee of the city.

510
00:40:56,759 --> 00:41:03,583
They also have the option for secondary insurance that is not covered by the primary health insurance.

511
00:41:04,423 --> 00:41:09,886
And one plan that employees do have access to is AFLAC.

512
00:41:10,707 --> 00:41:14,509
And just recently — The one with the duck?

513
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:15,990
The one with the duck, correct.

514
00:41:17,038 --> 00:41:30,625
Um, just recently, uh, it was brought to my attention that, uh, city employees are receiving, uh, letters from Aflac stating that, uh, dear customer, thank you for being an Aflac policy holder.

515
00:41:31,105 --> 00:41:37,249
We wanted to let you know that we are no longer receiving premium payments from the city of method for your coverage.

516
00:41:38,189 --> 00:41:43,392
And, uh, they go on to say in the letter that if you want to continue coverage and protection,

517
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:51,304
You need to contact AFLAC by December 12, 2016 to continue your policy.

518
00:41:52,365 --> 00:42:07,955
So the calls that I received actually asked why the city stopped paying a premium for coverage where employees have this taken out of their check weekly.

519
00:42:08,956 --> 00:42:13,399
And it was brought to my attention that the last payment that was made was in March

520
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,271
of 2016 to AFLAC.

521
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:28,175
And I think it's only appropriate, Mr. President, to find out, first of all, how many city employees are impacted by this nonpayment of premium by the city.

522
00:42:29,836 --> 00:42:37,538
At any time were city employees who paid for AFLAC coverage to the city not covered due to nonpayment of premium?

523
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:42,540
When did the city stop paying the AFLAC premium on behalf of city employees?

524
00:42:43,390 --> 00:42:56,253
Why was the premium payment withheld from Aflac and why were city employees not informed by the city that they would no longer have the secondary insurance that is taken weekly out of their check?

525
00:42:56,773 --> 00:42:59,894
So I think, uh, and I can present those questions to you, Mr. Clerk.

526
00:42:59,934 --> 00:43:01,615
I know I read them off kind of quickly.

527
00:43:02,315 --> 00:43:02,375
Um,

528
00:43:03,687 --> 00:43:15,455
I think it's only appropriate on behalf of any city employee that has a secondary insurance that we provide the answers on why this particular premium was not paid forth by the city.

529
00:43:15,495 --> 00:43:21,358
Mr. President, can you also move that that question be sent to the personnel office and the city's treasurer?

530
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:24,340
I sent it to the administration.

531
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:30,484
If that's what you want to send it to the, uh, treasurer and, uh, director of payroll, uh, that that's fine.

532
00:43:30,824 --> 00:43:31,725
So very good.

533
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,231
On the motion of Councilor Marks for approval, all those in favor?

534
00:43:35,251 --> 00:43:35,311
Aye.

535
00:43:35,911 --> 00:43:36,711
All those opposed?

536
00:43:40,872 --> 00:43:46,453
The tabled records of the meeting of November 1st, 2016 were passed to Councilor Falco.

537
00:43:47,073 --> 00:43:50,254
Councilor, have you had a chance to peruse these records?

538
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,454
Yes, I have, Mr. President.

539
00:43:51,514 --> 00:43:54,595
I have reviewed the records, found them to be in order, and move approval.

540
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:57,815
On the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, all those in favor?

541
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,376
Aye.

542
00:44:00,136 --> 00:44:00,956
All those opposed?

543
00:44:01,903 --> 00:44:02,704
The ayes have it.

544
00:44:03,524 --> 00:44:04,525
Records are approved.

545
00:44:04,985 --> 00:44:05,725
Councilor Marks.

546
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:11,569
If we could, uh, last week I offered a resolution paper 16 7 3 6 yes.

547
00:44:11,809 --> 00:44:14,211
Regarding, uh, the lights in Meffitt square.

548
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,973
Um, and we did get a response.

549
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:20,715
So if I could read the response, this has been an ongoing issue.

550
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,041
for a number of years, uh, the poor lighting in our business district.

551
00:44:25,581 --> 00:44:26,842
And we did get a response.

552
00:44:26,882 --> 00:44:44,167
I think that's, um, worth indicating, uh, to mayor Burke from Alicia hunt director of energy and environment dated, uh, November 10th, 2016, uh, regarding council paper 16 dash seven, three, six mayor Burke in response to the city council request

553
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:55,014
from information on the lighting in Meffitt Square and other squares, and their request that we begin converting to LED lighting throughout the city, I am providing the following information.

554
00:44:55,595 --> 00:45:05,139
The lighting in Meffitt Square presents a particular difficulty because of its unique decorative style and past retrofits that have been done over these fixtures.

555
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:12,422
We had a contractor install three different sample retrofits on Salem Street in front of Blue Fuji, Elizabeth Grady,

556
00:45:12,812 --> 00:45:14,714
and across the street at Meffitt Electronics.

557
00:45:15,454 --> 00:45:28,544
The one in front of Meffitt Electronics cast the most light down onto the sidewalk, and we've asked for a quote to do the entire square with that style lighting, but in somewhat warmer, less blue-white color.

558
00:45:29,345 --> 00:45:35,670
The preliminary estimate is $99,999 to do all the decorative lighting in Meffitt Square.

559
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,753
This should significantly increase the lighting levels in that area.

560
00:45:40,274 --> 00:45:41,775
It will use slightly less energy

561
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:49,367
so the project can be done in an energy-efficient project through my office, but will not qualify for any National Grid rebates or grants.

562
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:52,388
I do not have funding for this in my budget.

563
00:45:53,049 --> 00:45:57,171
I initiated the process to purchase our streetlights from National Grid in August.

564
00:45:57,551 --> 00:46:00,132
The first step is requesting a quote from them.

565
00:46:00,613 --> 00:46:05,255
Last week, National Grid representatives indicated that we might receive our quote in January.

566
00:46:05,935 --> 00:46:10,778
At that point, we can evaluate where the money would come from and then take the request to the council.

567
00:46:11,408 --> 00:46:19,254
Once the purchase is in process, we can put out an RFQ for a company to do the lighting audit and design, and then retrofit the lights with LEDs.

568
00:46:19,754 --> 00:46:24,938
We can include lighting throughout the squares and public parking lots as part of the evaluation and design.

569
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:33,805
We have already converted the parking lot lights behind City Hall and the lots by Clippership Drive, exterior lights at the Columbus School and Medford High School to LED.

570
00:46:34,433 --> 00:46:38,594
We are in the process of updating the exterior lights at the Roberts and Brooks to LED.

571
00:46:39,015 --> 00:46:43,516
I've been working closely with Steve Randazzo, the superintendent of wires on this project.

572
00:46:43,896 --> 00:46:48,418
Please let me know if there are any additional questions or if you would like further details at this time.

573
00:46:48,838 --> 00:46:49,418
Alicia Hunt.

574
00:46:50,098 --> 00:47:01,242
Uh, this is a very, very promising Mr. President, uh, an issue that has been a concern and brought up many countless times by this council, uh, to improve the lighting in our square.

575
00:47:01,262 --> 00:47:04,043
Um, and, uh, not just Meffitt square,

576
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:21,082
but all our business districts and I look forward to the eventual replacement of the lights with LED to really make downtown business districts bright, welcoming, and friendly, Mr. President.

577
00:47:21,682 --> 00:47:23,023
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

578
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:28,927
And the records of the meeting of November 15, 2016 were passed to Councilor Knight.

579
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:29,408
Councilor?

580
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:33,596
Uh, Mr. President, I haven't had an opportunity to review the records.

581
00:47:33,736 --> 00:47:38,357
And if we look at paper one six dash seven, five, eight, it was amended by counselor marks.

582
00:47:39,038 --> 00:47:42,899
Um, absent that one change, uh, everything is in order and I'd move for approval as amended.

583
00:47:42,919 --> 00:47:46,420
Mr. President on the motion for approval as amended.

584
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,261
All those in favor, all those opposed.

585
00:47:49,941 --> 00:47:54,642
Motion carries on the motion of council night that this meeting be adjourned.

586
00:47:54,702 --> 00:47:56,563
All those in favor, council Falco.

587
00:47:59,058 --> 00:48:00,299
Happy Thanksgiving, Councilor.

588
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,579
Happy Thanksgiving to you, too.

589
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:06,262
I just wanted to, just before we leave, just say good luck to the Medford High School football team.

590
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:07,403
Go Mustangs.

591
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:09,964
Playing Malden, the 129th meeting.

592
00:48:10,504 --> 00:48:11,745
And I just want to wish them well.

593
00:48:12,465 --> 00:48:13,486
Good luck, Mustangs.

594
00:48:13,906 --> 00:48:14,767
Where?

595
00:48:14,787 --> 00:48:15,147
Malden.

596
00:48:15,627 --> 00:48:16,087
Malden.

597
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:21,450
On the motion to adjourn, all those in favor?

598
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:22,251
Aye.

599
00:48:22,371 --> 00:48:23,131
All those opposed?

600
00:48:23,171 --> 00:48:24,072
Meeting is adjourned.

601
00:48:24,412 --> 00:48:27,794
Happy Thanksgiving to the citizens of Medford from the Medford City Council.

602
00:48:28,278 --> 00:48:36,745
And congratulations to our many friends who are involved in the Jingle Bell Festival and beautifying these council chambers and their charitable work.

603
00:48:37,325 --> 00:48:38,226
Happy Thanksgiving all.
