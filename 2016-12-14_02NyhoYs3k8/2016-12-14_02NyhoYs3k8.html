Burke, Mayor of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=62.423s">Good</a>  evening, Mr. President and Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=64.365s">Thank</a>  you so much for taking me out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=66.346s">I</a>  really appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=67.908s">As</a>  many of you are aware, last Friday the FAA had a meeting on the noise, the noise issues that we've been having in the city from the low flying planes. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=77.477s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn was in attendance as well as Councilor Capiello and Mark Rumley, the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=83.483s">We</a>  all kind of went up, hoping that we would get in, and at the last minute we found out that we did not have clearance to enter the FAA building. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=90.633s">We</a>  stayed for quite a while, and finally, when Congresswoman Clark appeared, she was able to overrule their rules, which required a 48-hour notice to have someone on the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=100.405s">So</a>  I was able to attend and sit in on the meeting, which we know impacts several of the neighborhoods throughout Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=107.431s">This</a>  meeting was put together at the bequest of a state senator that represented the Belmont Watertown area. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=113.336s">So</a>  the FAA was just listening to the request, and that's why they held the meeting, and it was scheduled with those parties involved, and the city of Medford really wasn't invited formally. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=123.745s">But</a>  I did want to just come back to let you know what transpired during the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=128.329s">Obviously,</a>  a lot of the CAC members, Logan has a community board as well as Massport, so the two separate community boards that meet regularly. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=138.958s">And</a>  several of those members were in attendance during this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=143.242s">They</a>  had been previously cleared. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=145.904s">So</a>  they brought the issues of what they're dealing with as well as we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=150.73s">We</a>  all know firsthand that there's certain sections of the city that have been impacted by the change and basically what the FAA has tried to do is simplify the air <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=162.103s">travel</a>  routes. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=163.043s">So</a>  back a year or so ago, a year and a half, the planes were dispersed over multiple cities throughout the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=172.146s">So</a>  when they took off, they were dispersed, so we all dealt with an occasional sound here and there, but nobody was impacted <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=178.388s">directly</a>  all day long with a certain sound. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=181.29s">They</a>  try to simplify the skies, make travel lanes, and therefore it has brought about the volume that is going over one particular route in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=190.435s">There's</a>  actually quite an area over the Malden Hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=193.637s">It's</a>  where the planes that come off of runway 33L, they actually split, and they go in different directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=200.201s">So</a>  that particular area gets hit very hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=203.723s">And</a>  in a lot of the studies that the community groups have done, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=207.605s">They're</a>  actually looking at the Stearns Ave area as being hit very, very hard in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=213.428s">So</a>  what we talked to the FAA about was, what are you going to do about it? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=217.39s">We're</a>  all dealing with this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=218.791s">It's</a>  a quality of life issue in our neighborhood and the surrounding communities, and what are you going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=224.214s">And</a>  they basically told us that they have MIT, Massport has commissioned MIT to do a formal study, but it will not be ready until next fall. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=231.898s">So</a>  a year from now, they'll get the results of the sound <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=235.612s">testing</a>  that they have commissioned through Massport. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=239.195s">And</a>  of course, we all said that's not good enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=243.018s">Go</a>  back to the way it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=244.239s">Do</a>  something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=245.78s">And</a>  the FAA's position is that it's all about safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=249.303s">Their</a>  main concern above and beyond sound is safety for <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=253.246s">the</a>  flights, the people on the planes, the pilots, and the workers, and the FAA in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=259.59s">So</a>  they heard our cry for help, and not only is it that there are the numbers that are traveling down these roads in the sky, but the elevation, the volume, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=272.624s">which</a>  are two of the main concerns that are also causing havoc in our area. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=277.245s">So</a>  they listened intently. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=279.226s">They</a>  said that they were going to reach out through Massport and try to get some more information quicker. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=284.667s">We</a>  actually do have a sound study that's part of Massport that's set up in Magoon Thatcher area and that they do not have the results from that yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=295.109s">So</a>  once they get those results, they will be forthcoming to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=298.472s">They</a>  use a 65 decibel as their magic number, and that's what they've been using as their level that is tolerable. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=306.258s">And</a>  so I know what I mentioned to them is that they need to stop looking at things from the sky, and they need to come down to the neighborhoods and see the real impact that it's causing on our citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=317.306s">So</a>  they did seem to listen, they're heavily on, they want to do constituent service, community involvement, so they vowed to us that they will be having many more community meetings and we're actually going to be working with Senator Markey's office to get a straight Medford meeting, which all of you certainly will be able to attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=335.971s">So</a>  we are working on putting that together in the next couple of weeks so that we can deal with the Medford issues in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=341.013s">And</a>  just lastly, I just wanted to mention that today I've named Peter Hook to the Massport CAC community group, and Luke Priessner as the Logan CAC representative, and the backup to Logan will be Peter. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=355.18s">who's</a>  on our mass board. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=356.94s">So</a>  these two individuals have been very much involved in this process the entire time. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=361.501s">They've</a>  been outspoken and data-driven and looked at a lot of the facts and circumstances around the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=367.683s">So</a>  I know that they will hit the ground running. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=369.523s">They</a>  will be invested and involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=371.183s">It</a>  directly impacts their quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=373.904s">So</a>  I'm looking forward to them serving on behalf of the city of Medford, and I'm sure that they will do a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=379.825s">So</a>  thank you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=380.585s">I</a>  just wanted to give you a verbal update on the Friday meeting, um, so that you're all aware of it as well as the general public. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=386.068s">So</a>  we can move forward and try to rectify the issues that are at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=390.61s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=391.53s">Thank</a>  you, Your Honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=393.011s">If</a>  I may, Madam Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=394.711s">Thank</a>  you, President Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=396.232s">And</a>  thank you, Mayor Burke, um, not only for coming to give us an update tonight, but also for being there on Friday. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=401.414s">Um,</a>  it was unfortunate Rick and I weren't allowed in, but we were happy that at least our state delegation and you were there to represent the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=408.89s">The</a>  question I have is with regards to this vote that was supposed to be taking place in Boston in December. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=414.271s">Now,</a>  is that still going to be taking place with regards to rerouting the Milton air traffic over Medford, or is that something?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=420.592s">It</a>  didn't sound like from the FAA that they were taking any actions immediate, because they're waiting on this MIT study to determine everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=428.033s">They</a>  said, basically, they can't just look at our runway in particular, because our runway impacts every other runway. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=434.554s">So</a>  if they ought to alter the routes in our area, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=438.375s">It's</a>  like a domino effect, it impacts every other route that affects Milton, the North Shore, the South Shore. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=445.237s">So</a>  it didn't sound like they will be taking action, but I believe that that's a Massport meeting, so these gentlemen will be in attendance.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=452.939s">So</a>  the members of, people from the FAA will be at the Massport meeting, and so we don't know 100% if this vote is gonna take place or not, but you don't believe so?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=462.061s">FAA</a>  controls the sky lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=464.301s">Massport</a>  controls the time that the planes can run, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=468.088s">how</a>  many can go up, how frequent that they can be dispersed out of Logan. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=472.91s">So</a>  it's funny when you bring up certain issues to FAA, they say, well, that's not really it. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=477.691s">We</a>  just tell them where they can go. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=478.912s">We</a>  don't tell them when they can go and how many can go, the frequency. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=483.213s">But</a>  certainly, if they're all going and they're all going down a certain route, we're impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=488.115s">So</a>  they heard us loud and clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=490.516s">So</a>  I would doubt very much that they're going to do anything that's going to impact a particular area, especially until the study's done.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=497.532s">And</a>  then you said the fall of 2017, all of 17, which is astounding.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=501.554s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=503.495s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=503.935s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=504.615s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=505.536s">Madam</a>  mayor for your presence and a happy Thanksgiving.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=508.857s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=509.318s">Enjoy</a>  your family and enjoy your meal. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=512.819s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=514.06s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Pratt. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=515.18s">Just</a>  had a quick question, madam mayor, if you wouldn't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=518.122s">Um,</a>  it was reported in, uh, the transcript just the other day that, uh, there hasn't been a member of, uh, an appointed member of, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=527.019s">uh,</a>  this community that has attended any of the CAC meetings, the Logan airport, uh, community advisory meetings, uh, in the last two and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=536.029s">And</a>  I was wondering if we can get any feedback, why the appointed members haven't shown up, why the city of method doesn't have a voice at the table when many of these issues are brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=546.393s">discussing</a>  runways and discussing other issues that impact our community.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=550.995s">We</a>  did have a Massport representative that attended some of the meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=554.537s">Unfortunately,</a>  they've canceled several of the last few months based upon not having enough information. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=560.199s">So</a>  we did have a representative that was at those meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=562.9s">The</a>  original Logan CAC was established many, many years ago, and it was for sound, really, looking at the sound lanes. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=571.924s">And</a>  then the Massport CAC kicked in that looks at everything, all the operations of Massport. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=576.686s">So</a>  we do have a Massport CAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=579.247s">As</a>  you're aware, I just named some new bodies to that so that we will have full activity on that commission.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=585.609s">Right,</a>  but I'm specifically talking about the Logan Airport, which that board has an appointed member by the mayor, the past mayor and yourself, correct?</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=594.953s">It</a>  has an appointment and it has a... <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=597.466s">an</a>  alternate as well.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=598.487s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=599.468s">That's</a>  the particular board that I'm talking about that hasn't been represented by this community in two and a half years.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=606.152s">I</a>  can't go back prior to the year, the 10 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=609.494s">I</a>  can only look at the 10 months and I wasn't aware that Logan, I don't even know if Logan has had a meeting, but Massport has had meetings over the last several months. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=618.237s">Massport</a>  has had several meetings as well.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=620.338s">And</a>  so has Logan, just so you know, they've had several meetings and our representative for whatever reason, maybe one wasn't appointed or it was an in between time. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=629.081s">Uh,</a>  but, uh, we haven't had a representative on that board speaking on behalf of the residents of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=635.722s">in</a>  two and a half years over a dozen meetings that we have failed to go to the table and at least have our opinions voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=642.69s">So</a>  maybe, um, at some point it'd be nice to have a check and balance that we know when we appoint people, even this council, we appoint people, not as many as the mayor's office, but we appoint people to boards of commissions as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=655.668s">And</a>  it might be a good idea or it might be a good policy, Mr. President, to make sure that our representatives are truly attending these particular meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=664.251s">And</a>  maybe there should be some type of policy devised that would encourage maybe some type of sign-in or allow us to know if our representatives are truly making these meetings.</p>

    <p>[Stephanie Muccini Burke]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=675.595s">Well,</a>  I've actually read the Mass Support and the Logan, their enabling legislation. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=681.337s">And</a>  they're supposed to be in attendance, and if they miss a few, I think it's three meetings in one case, they're different between the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=687.504s">They're</a>  supposed to notify the appointing authority that someone is not going to these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=691.949s">So</a>  if they're not, if they were not notifying, obviously they didn't notify me, or I would have taken action. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=698.176s">before</a>  tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=699.797s">So</a>  going forward, we're going to check. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=701.798s">We'll</a>  get a monthly report from the meetings themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=704.779s">These</a>  individuals are very active in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=707.1s">They're</a>  very active with this particular issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=709.681s">So</a>  I know that they will make us very proud and we'll be reflecting our interests there as well.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1008.113s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1010.214s">So</a>  we met last Tuesday night in a subcommittee meeting, myself, vice president, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1016.803s">Mungo</a>  Kerner and a Councilor, Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1019.284s">And</a>  we met with, um, the friends of Fellsmere Heights and actually the method police department as well to talk about, uh, any type of traffic issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1026.767s">And,</a>  uh, it was a good discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1028.568s">Uh,</a>  uh, friends of Fellsmere Heights laid out their plan for what they would like to see in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1033.81s">Um,</a>  yeah, in a, in contrast to what the developer is actually proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1040.353s">And</a>  during that conversation, uh, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1043.053s">actually</a>  a mass general law came up, uh, chapter one 80 section eight a concerning, uh, sale, lease, and exchange of nonprofits, uh, corporations assets. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1053.459s">And,</a>  um, what this involves is basically, uh, it, it, it involves a charitable corporation planning to dispose of its assets, uh, must notify the attorney general within 30 days before doing so. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1067.026s">And,</a>  uh, it goes, the law goes on to state that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1071.138s">And</a>  it was actually updated in July 21st of 2000 that it requires a non-profit acute care hospital or health maintenance organization to give 90 days notice to the Attorney General and the Commissioner of Public Health before the sale, lease, exchange, or other disposition of substantial amount of its assets with a personal entity other than the public charity. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1095.93s">Following</a>  receipt of the notice, the AG, the Attorney General's Office is to investigate and or hold a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1104.134s">And</a>  so the Friends of Fellsmere Heights actually, back in 2015, inquired about this with the Attorney General's Office. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1112.537s">And</a>  the Attorney General's Office actually <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1116.684s">basically</a>  came back saying that this doesn't apply because they ruled that Hallmark Health is not a acute care facility or an HMO, a health maintenance organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1129.036s">So</a>  they basically turned it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1132.119s">And</a>  there seems to be a lot of doubt as to whether or not they should have done that because <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1138.59s">you</a>  know, why is the law there in the first place? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1140.852s">Um,</a>  you know, it hasn't been used in a hospital for a while, but I mean, technically it's still on the Malvern hospital is still owned by hallmark health. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1149.539s">It's</a>  still, uh, listed as an asset on their books. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1152.641s">So</a>  we really should be considered as part of the hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1156.444s">Um,</a>  so we would like the city solicitor, uh, to actually look into this a little bit further and, uh, give us an opinion as to whether or not, um, probably the, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1166.35s">whether</a>  or not we should inquire with the Attorney General on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1171.094s">Really,</a>  I mean, it definitely seems odd that the law is there, but the Attorney General's office really isn't following through with it, from what we could tell. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1182.483s">So</a>  we'd like City Solicitor Rumley to look into this, offer us an opinion, and I'm sure my council colleagues would definitely like to speak on this as well, but we felt that this should be looked into further. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1196.188s">Thank</a>  you council. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1197.449s">Madam</a>  vice president.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1198.55s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1198.91s">I'm</a>  president Delaware. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1200.171s">So</a>  I think John gave a good synopsis of, you know, the law and what it entails and what it, what it was, the purpose was. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1208.938s">Um,</a>  and I think it's really important that the, the city look into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1212.841s">We,</a>  we do own three acres of that property and there is a developer who has a proposal that's obviously scaled down from their last proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1221.587s">We</a>  also have the group, the friends of the Felsmere Heights who, who have a, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1225.615s">almost</a>  a better proposal, obviously less dense, um, less units and more open space. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1232.68s">So</a>  it's something that we want to push and, um, advocate for. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1236.422s">And</a>  we would love the attorney general's help to oversee this because the intent of the law is to figure out for this five, I guess, reasons why the law was put in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1247.789s">But</a>  for Medford it's important because it, it will help figure out whether the proposed transaction is in the best is in the public's interests. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1255.281s">And</a>  I think that's something we would love to have the Attorney General review with the help of being pushed, obviously, by our city solicitor, Mark Rumley, because when the, back in September, September, October of 2015, there was a group of people that did ask the Attorney General's office for some help, and they ruled that it wasn't acute care, you know, mainly, I think, because it was closed down, it was closed down in 2000, but that's truly not the intent of the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1283.599s">I</a>  think if you're gonna, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1285.109s">any</a>  acute care facility that wants to get around Chapter 180 would just close down and sell a month or two or 10, 15 years later. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1293.671s">Where</a>  in this, you know, the intent of the law is to make sure that the public's interests are taken into account, whether you're closed, no matter when you're closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1303.933s">It's</a>  the fact that it was a hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1305.774s">It</a>  was owned by Malden Healthcare and then sold to Hallmark Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1311.326s">So</a>  we want to ask the city solicitor to advocate on Medford's behalf, on obviously the behalf of the friends of Felsmere Heights and all the residents who are affected by this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1321.673s">We</a>  want to ask that the AG do investigate and do look into this parcel and do render an opinion and create an atmosphere where there is a public hearing, which I think is going to be extremely beneficial in the long run. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1333.541s">So</a>  I do respectfully ask that our city solicitor look into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1337.304s">There</a>  is a letter that was drafted <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1340.776s">to</a>  the AG's office, September 14th, 2015, that we'd probably like to give to our solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1347.641s">We</a>  have hard copies and I think we've all been emailed the letter and that will be a good starting point and I think Mark and his office would do a great job advocating for the community and hopefully get the attention of the AG, which the friends haven't been able to do yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1361.992s">And</a>  I think coming from, obviously, with the mayor's support and our AG's, our city solicitor's office, it would go a long way.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1370.483s">So</a>  if you would kindly Madam Vice President, uh, give a copy of that letter to the, uh, city messenger so he can convey it, uh, to the, uh, city solicitor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1380.546s">Uh,</a>  the chair recognizes council night.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1382.947s">Um,</a>  Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1383.647s">So</a>  as I understand this, the question that we're asking the city solicitor at this point in time would be, does chapter 180 of the Massachusetts general laws apply regarding the sale and redevelopment of the Malden hospital site? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1397.992s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1399.659s">Move</a>  approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1401.06s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1403.842s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1405.723s">If</a>  I can, thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1409.026s">I</a>  will not repeat what Councilor Fowle and Councilor Lungo-Koehn have already expressed, but I think again, this is so important for the constituents and especially the Fulton Heights area because the realization is coming closer and we need to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1427.507s">We</a>  overturn every rock and we investigate every possible concern and issue that if that is developed for what they intend to develop in that area, the major impact is not going to be on Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1440.771s">It's</a>  not going to be on Melrose. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1442.311s">It'll</a>  be in our neighborhoods in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1443.832s">So</a>  I appreciate also wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1448.357s">uh,</a>  thank, um, Sergeant, um, hard net for being out and they've already started traffic studies in the area to help us further along. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1456.201s">So</a>  we can hold a, I know that one of the questions, make sure the public wanted to reiterate to the public that we're looking to hold a, uh, one of our next meetings at, uh, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1466.146s">Francis</a>  in that area to make sure more residents can come out and be heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1470.068s">So,</a>  um, I just want to make sure I've mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1472.89s">And,</a>  uh, thanks for my colleagues for all their work. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1474.771s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1475.391s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1475.751s">Councilor</a>  chair recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1478.35s">Uh,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1478.871s">And</a>  I want to thank, uh, the, uh, council president and the members of the ad hoc committee for, uh, their diligence on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1487.077s">Uh,</a>  as we know, this is a very important issue to, uh, neighbors up the heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1492.522s">And,</a>  uh, if the project was built out in its current capacity, it would have a devastating impact on traffic, uh, as we know it, uh, in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1501.989s">Uh,</a>  we also heard tonight from the mayor that the FAA, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1505.432s">is</a>  looking to change plane routes on some of the runways that impact this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1513.099s">And</a>  the highest impact will be to the heights and to Wellington. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1517.822s">So</a>  think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1518.623s">Think</a>  about if this project that we're talking about were to go through with the additional traffic, road traffic, and think about if the runway to go through with the additional air traffic <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1528.591s">we</a>  may have a mass exodus out of certain parts of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1532.856s">And</a>  I think we have to be very diligent and persistent on these issues and shake every tree possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1539.594s">And</a>  I think this is a great recommendation that's being offered tonight to have the city solicitor offer an opinion and then to go towards the Attorney General's office and have the Attorney General's office at least give some guidance on the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1554.006s">And</a>  I agree with Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1556.748s">The</a>  possibility of having a public hearing that involves both communities united, I think would be extremely helpful, Mr. President, in making sure that this area is addressed in a way that <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1569.314s">doesn't</a>  impact the quality of life in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1572.215s">We're</a>  not against building. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1573.696s">I</a>  don't think anyone's against building, at least in this council or in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1577.977s">But</a>  we want sensible approach to building in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1582.039s">We</a>  want a sensible approach to neighborhoods that have existed for over 100 years, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1589.742s">And</a>  we want to be mindful of that fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1592.343s">So</a>  I support this wholeheartedly and thank the ad hoc committee for their <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=1599.004s">efforts</a>  on this matter.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2209.478s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2210.699s">Uh,</a>  just briefly, I just wanted to give, uh, my fellow Councilors and our constituents an update. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2216.502s">Um,</a>  today, um, I know we've, we requested for the department of transportation and, uh, the MBTA to look at the bus stop over at high street in Maine and ask that it be temporarily, um, closed due to the construction concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2234.251s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2235.694s">It</a>  hasn't happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2237.055s">Today,</a>  I did drive by, and what I witnessed is something that I think is a very, very dangerous situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2244.16s">They</a>  had barrels along the right lane, along the sidewalk, closing that area for the buses to get to the sidewalk, and buses stopping in the left lane to let riders walk up to that bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2264.374s">Not</a>  only did I see <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2265.881s">I</a>  found concerns in the people walking off the curb and walking across an open street, but I found the way the bus was stopping, it really lent some safety concerns for pedestrians and the crosswalk behind them on high street. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2280.153s">So</a>  I requested that, um, I'd like, I would request that we, we reach out to, um, uh, the MBTA department of, uh, the DOT to, um, call for a subcommittee with transportation and, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2295.347s">visit</a>  and question these concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2298.188s">Uh,</a>  the, the feedback I got back today was that, uh, that, that stop, if it was closed for a long period of time, it would lose his grandfather clause for ADA accessibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2308.912s">And</a>  then if would be brought back in the future, it would, we would have to redesign the whole sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2313.834s">So</a>  that was something we never, we'd never heard in multiple meetings with, uh, their, their, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2322.3s">their</a>  group and it bothers bothers me that they said that they did say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2326.944s">So</a>  if I've talked to my fellow, uh, members of our committee and that's never been said. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2332.068s">So</a>  we want to make sure that the, they're hearing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2335.271s">Um,</a>  and, uh, another concern I had from a constituent was, um, a concern that I'd like to talk, uh, and address with them is the, the wait period, especially with the cold weather coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2347.091s">uh,</a>  the, the amount of time that people are waiting, uh, at some of our bus stops, uh, here in the city and maybe bring that to light. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2355.383s">And,</a>  um, I welcome any constituent to call me and, uh, if they're having any direct concerns at their stop, so we can bring those directly. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2362.994s">I</a>  know I have, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2363.758s">had</a>  a few, but if there are more out there, I'd like to bring that forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2367.1s">So</a>  if we can, we can with, um, city clerk set up that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2371.742s">Uh,</a>  if we can sit together and find a neutral time with that organization, it'd be great.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2378.225s">And</a>  the subcommittee on transportation. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2380.587s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2381.047s">That</a>  motion, all those in favor, all those opposed carries off by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2386.149s">Be</a>  resolved that the light post pedestrian walk sign in front of whole foods, which was knocked down last Saturday, be replaced. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2393.533s">by</a>  the Department of Conservation and Recreation in the interest of public safety council.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2400.378s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2401.439s">Uh,</a>  this particular, uh, pedestrian walk signal, uh, serves for a lot of pedestrians who would like to cross over to go to Whole Foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2409.906s">And,</a>  uh, right now there is no light there that, uh, stops traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2414.789s">And</a>  so I asked that we send a paper immediately to DCR, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2418.612s">and</a>  also our state delegation for any assistance they can provide in getting this particular pedestrian walk signal posted back immediately in the interest of public safety.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2429.339s">So</a>  if you would send that to Senator Jaylund and Representative Goppely who represents that district. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2436.084s">On</a>  the motion, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2438.045s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2438.725s">Motion</a>  carries. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2439.566s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2441.087s">Be</a>  it resolved that the city employee's secondary insurance be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2445.089s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2447.073s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2448.854s">As</a>  we're probably all aware, or may not be aware, city employees are entitled to health insurance as an employee of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2456.759s">They</a>  also have the option for secondary insurance that is not covered by the primary health insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2464.423s">And</a>  one plan that employees do have access to is AFLAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2470.707s">And</a>  just recently — The one with the duck? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2475.009s">The</a>  one with the duck, correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2477.038s">Um,</a>  just recently, uh, it was brought to my attention that, uh, city employees are receiving, uh, letters from Aflac stating that, uh, dear customer, thank you for being an Aflac policy holder. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2491.105s">We</a>  wanted to let you know that we are no longer receiving premium payments from the city of method for your coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2498.189s">And,</a>  uh, they go on to say in the letter that if you want to continue coverage and protection, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2503.899s">You</a>  need to contact AFLAC by December 12, 2016 to continue your policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2512.365s">So</a>  the calls that I received actually asked why the city stopped paying a premium for coverage where employees have this taken out of their check weekly. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2528.956s">And</a>  it was brought to my attention that the last payment that was made was in March <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2533.99s">of</a>  2016 to AFLAC. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2537.131s">And</a>  I think it's only appropriate, Mr. President, to find out, first of all, how many city employees are impacted by this nonpayment of premium by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2549.836s">At</a>  any time were city employees who paid for AFLAC coverage to the city not covered due to nonpayment of premium? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2558.579s">When</a>  did the city stop paying the AFLAC premium on behalf of city employees? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2563.39s">Why</a>  was the premium payment withheld from Aflac and why were city employees not informed by the city that they would no longer have the secondary insurance that is taken weekly out of their check? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2576.773s">So</a>  I think, uh, and I can present those questions to you, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2579.934s">I</a>  know I read them off kind of quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2582.315s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2583.687s">I</a>  think it's only appropriate on behalf of any city employee that has a secondary insurance that we provide the answers on why this particular premium was not paid forth by the city.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2595.495s">Mr.</a>  President, can you also move that that question be sent to the personnel office and the city's treasurer?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2602.839s">I</a>  sent it to the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2604.58s">If</a>  that's what you want to send it to the, uh, treasurer and, uh, director of payroll, uh, that that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2610.824s">So</a>  very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2612.31s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Marks for approval, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2615.251s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2615.911s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2620.872s">The</a>  tabled records of the meeting of November 1st, 2016 were passed to Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2627.073s">Councilor,</a>  have you had a chance to peruse these records?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2630.294s">Yes,</a>  I have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2631.514s">I</a>  have reviewed the records, found them to be in order, and move approval.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2634.935s">On</a>  the motion for approval by Councilor Falco, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2637.835s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2640.136s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2641.903s">The</a>  ayes have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2643.524s">Records</a>  are approved.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2644.985s">Councilor</a>  Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2646.786s">If</a>  we could, uh, last week I offered a resolution paper 16 7 3 6 yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2651.809s">Regarding,</a>  uh, the lights in Medford square. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2655.111s">Um,</a>  and we did get a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2657.633s">So</a>  if I could read the response, this has been an ongoing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2661.38s">for</a>  a number of years, uh, the poor lighting in our business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2665.581s">And</a>  we did get a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2666.882s">I</a>  think that's, um, worth indicating, uh, to mayor Burke from Alicia hunt director of energy and environment dated, uh, November 10th, 2016, uh, regarding council paper 16-seven, three, six mayor Burke in response to the city council request <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2684.63s">from</a>  information on the lighting in Medford Square and other squares, and their request that we begin converting to LED lighting throughout the city, I am providing the following information. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2695.595s">The</a>  lighting in Medford Square presents a particular difficulty because of its unique decorative style and past retrofits that have been done over these fixtures. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2705.799s">We</a>  had a contractor install three different sample retrofits on Salem Street in front of Blue Fuji, Elizabeth Grady, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2712.812s">and</a>  across the street at Medford Electronics. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2715.454s">The</a>  one in front of Medford Electronics cast the most light down onto the sidewalk, and we've asked for a quote to do the entire square with that style lighting, but in somewhat warmer, less blue-white color. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2729.345s">The</a>  preliminary estimate is $99,999 to do all the decorative lighting in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2736.15s">This</a>  should significantly increase the lighting levels in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2740.274s">It</a>  will use slightly less energy <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2742.123s">so</a>  the project can be done in an energy-efficient project through my office, but will not qualify for any National Grid rebates or grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2749.827s">I</a>  do not have funding for this in my budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2753.049s">I</a>  initiated the process to purchase our streetlights from National Grid in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2757.551s">The</a>  first step is requesting a quote from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2760.613s">Last</a>  week, National Grid representatives indicated that we might receive our quote in January. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2765.935s">At</a>  that point, we can evaluate where the money would come from and then take the request to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2771.408s">Once</a>  the purchase is in process, we can put out an RFQ for a company to do the lighting audit and design, and then retrofit the lights with LEDs. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2779.754s">We</a>  can include lighting throughout the squares and public parking lots as part of the evaluation and design. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2785.499s">We</a>  have already converted the parking lot lights behind City Hall and the lots by Clippership Drive, exterior lights at the Columbus School and Medford High School to LED. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2794.433s">We</a>  are in the process of updating the exterior lights at the Roberts and Brooks to LED. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2799.015s">I've</a>  been working closely with Steve Randazzo, the superintendent of wires on this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2803.896s">Please</a>  let me know if there are any additional questions or if you would like further details at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2808.838s">Alicia</a>  Hunt. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2810.098s">Uh,</a>  this is a very, very promising Mr. President, uh, an issue that has been a concern and brought up many countless times by this council, uh, to improve the lighting in our square. <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2821.262s">Um,</a>  and, uh, not just Medford square, <a href="https://youtu.be/02NyhoYs3k8&t=2824.47s">but</a>  all our business districts and I look forward to the eventual replacement of the lights with LED to really make downtown business districts bright, welcoming, and friendly, Mr. President.</p>
