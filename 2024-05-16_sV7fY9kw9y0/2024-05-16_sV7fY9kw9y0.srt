1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,690
[SPEAKER_11]: to make it today because of the prior commitment to work.

2
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:08,733
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am going to get us going.

3
00:00:09,094 --> 00:00:10,114
[SPEAKER_11]: So wait, it's 301.

4
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:10,854
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, good.

5
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:15,977
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm trying to figure out, my kids aren't home.

6
00:00:16,037 --> 00:00:17,818
[SPEAKER_11]: So hopefully that will remain the case.

7
00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:21,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, everyone.

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,301
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the May 15, 2024 subcommittee of the Fever Health

9
00:00:28,826 --> 00:00:31,588
[SPEAKER_11]: and special education subcommittee meeting for three o'clock.

10
00:00:32,589 --> 00:00:35,231
[SPEAKER_11]: This meeting is being held via Zoom only.

11
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:40,975
[SPEAKER_11]: It will be recorded and is being broadcast onto Zoom as we speak.

12
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:44,298
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do hear that I'm not alone anymore.

13
00:00:45,639 --> 00:00:49,862
[SPEAKER_11]: The YouTube link is in the meeting notice.

14
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:50,642
[SPEAKER_11]: It is

15
00:00:51,778 --> 00:01:10,279
[SPEAKER_11]: https://mps02155-org.zoom.us slash u slash A-D-D-N-A-W-M capital L-G capital Y. I think they thought that was better than the old way.

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,140
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if I agree.

17
00:01:11,949 --> 00:01:24,752
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyways, if you have any questions or comments you want to send during the meeting rather than speaking up, you can send those to me directly at PRUSEAU at medford.k12.ma.us.

18
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:29,814
[SPEAKER_11]: Please include your first and last name, your Medford Street address, your question or comment.

19
00:01:30,154 --> 00:01:33,574
[SPEAKER_11]: The agenda for today, as approved by the committee on April 29th, 2024, item two,

20
00:01:35,754 --> 00:01:50,377
[SPEAKER_11]: Item 2024-22, be it resolved that the Special Education Behavioral Health Subcommittee will meet to discuss whether the Curtis-Tufts School should be co-located with the Medford High School campus to improve educational outcomes for Curtis-Tufts students.

21
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:52,338
[SPEAKER_11]: Say that three times fast.

22
00:01:53,278 --> 00:01:57,739
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it further resolved that the subcommittee will invite current and former students and staff to provide

23
00:01:58,635 --> 00:02:16,721
[SPEAKER_11]: comments, but it also resolved that the committee will report back to the school committee on whether the credits test program should be co-located no later than June 3rd, 2024, because this information is critical to the progress of the Medford Comprehensive High School Building Committee as it completes the district's educational profile.

24
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:17,921
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a mouthful.

25
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:21,582
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to take the roll.

26
00:02:21,662 --> 00:02:24,543
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Intapa is absent.

27
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:25,724
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Olapade?

28
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:27,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Present.

29
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:30,053
[SPEAKER_11]: And member Rousseau is present, two present.

30
00:02:30,073 --> 00:02:30,934
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a quorum.

31
00:02:32,035 --> 00:02:33,435
[SPEAKER_11]: We have lots of people popping on.

32
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:34,076
[SPEAKER_11]: This is lovely.

33
00:02:34,116 --> 00:02:37,858
[SPEAKER_11]: We usually have zero people on subcommittees other than those of us that have to be here.

34
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:39,119
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's nice.

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,081
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I was trying to figure out how to run this meeting.

36
00:02:44,549 --> 00:03:06,707
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will admit it's an unusual subcommittee meeting because there's not like some policy we're updating or, but I thought maybe we could go around and introduce ourselves, those of us that are here so that you can say like why you're here, just for my notes, but also so we can have a sense of how to move the meeting along.

37
00:03:07,807 --> 00:03:13,072
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'll start at the top for me, which is of course different for everyone and that'd be Suzanne.

38
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:17,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, good afternoon.

39
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:20,615
[SPEAKER_00]: Suzanne Galussi, Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction.

40
00:03:21,536 --> 00:03:37,948
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here just to be a participant in the decision-making process and very curious about the rollout of the Curtis-Tufts and possible participation with Medford High School.

41
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:40,269
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

42
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:43,812
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Olapade, I just want to say who you are in case everybody doesn't already know.

43
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:45,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

44
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:46,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everyone.

45
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:47,115
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Aaron Olapade.

46
00:03:47,135 --> 00:03:49,198
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on the school committee with member Rousseau.

47
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:53,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just excited to be here to kind of discuss this idea and hopefully move things forward.

48
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:54,367
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you.

49
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:55,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

50
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

51
00:03:58,186 --> 00:03:59,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, good afternoon, everyone.

52
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:13,436
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Marice Edouard-Vincent, superintendent of schools, and I'm happy to be here tonight to be part of this conversation as well and listen to the proposals regarding the Curtis Tufts School.

53
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:14,276
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

54
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:15,117
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

55
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:15,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Ms.

56
00:04:15,217 --> 00:04:15,457
[SPEAKER_01]: Bowen?

57
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:18,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Good afternoon, everyone.

58
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:19,158
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Joan Bowen.

59
00:04:19,198 --> 00:04:22,238
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm director of student services here at Medford Public Schools.

60
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:30,941
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm here also to provide some historical background as well as informational background about the Curtis Tufts, as well as the staff here.

61
00:04:32,402 --> 00:04:37,223
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been in discussions about where we see the Curtis Tufts in the future.

62
00:04:37,263 --> 00:04:45,286
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think this is a very important meeting to get feedback from the stakeholders and then make our decisions going forward.

63
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:45,886
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

64
00:04:46,698 --> 00:04:47,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

65
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:55,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, my name is Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Schools for Enrichment, Innovation, and Operations.

66
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:07,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm here as someone who has worked closely in the past with the Curtis-Tufts, and I'm very excited as we move through the MSBA process to see about this co-location opportunity for the benefit of students.

67
00:05:08,844 --> 00:05:09,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

68
00:05:10,162 --> 00:05:12,964
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a little fly running around, so I'm not losing it.

69
00:05:12,984 --> 00:05:14,044
[SPEAKER_11]: I just like can't get it.

70
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:19,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Next up, I have Jess Ferley, Healy, excuse me.

71
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:24,230
[SPEAKER_11]: And if you don't wanna introduce yourself or anything, that's perfectly fine too.

72
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:27,232
[SPEAKER_11]: And actually.

73
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:28,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, sorry.

74
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:36,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just here to see the update of what we're gonna be doing with the Curtis Tufts and just to observe.

75
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:38,233
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Jess.

76
00:05:38,673 --> 00:05:41,414
[SPEAKER_11]: And I have Lori, but I believe there's more than one person there, so.

77
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:45,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, I'm Lori Hodgdon.

78
00:05:45,556 --> 00:05:48,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the current school director here at Curtis Tufts.

79
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:53,779
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my second year, and I'm here with two colleagues who are teachers at the Curtis Tufts.

80
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:56,156
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Kate Lillard.

81
00:05:56,176 --> 00:06:01,600
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all special ed teachers, but I'm teaching math at the Curtis Tufts.

82
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,124
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my first year here, but I was at the Andrews Middle School for nine years before that.

83
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:09,026
[SPEAKER_02]: And tell Nev I said hi.

84
00:06:09,946 --> 00:06:10,467
[SPEAKER_11]: I will.

85
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:12,768
[SPEAKER_11]: She's at Travers Ed right now.

86
00:06:13,369 --> 00:06:13,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, good.

87
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:15,871
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Tom Morris.

88
00:06:16,411 --> 00:06:18,092
[SPEAKER_06]: I started at Curtis Tufts this year.

89
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:21,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a special educator, and my focus right now is on science.

90
00:06:24,189 --> 00:06:24,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful.

91
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,753
[SPEAKER_11]: It's good to know is in the room, little easier when we're actually in person, but then we all can make it so.

92
00:06:31,874 --> 00:06:36,918
[SPEAKER_11]: So, at the school committee meeting where we had this motion made.

93
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:51,524
[SPEAKER_11]: really wasn't the point of the topic or the conversation going on, but there was, I forget the person's name, who is not actually able to make it here, is the director of the program over at Somerville.

94
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:55,627
[SPEAKER_11]: And I believe in Somerville, they used to have a program separated very much like we have.

95
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:59,390
[SPEAKER_11]: And then when they rebuilt Somerville High, are they actually done?

96
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,032
[SPEAKER_11]: It's been the longest project in history, it seems.

97
00:07:02,372 --> 00:07:05,395
[SPEAKER_11]: But when they rebuilt Somerville High, they added

98
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:18,034
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it's a wing we haven't actually taken a tour yet for their alternative high school students and apparently it has been beyond wonderful he described.

99
00:07:19,434 --> 00:07:30,980
[SPEAKER_11]: dramatic increases in participation of those students in extracurriculars, you know, sporting and club presidents and things that are very difficult when you're not located with the rest of the student body.

100
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:43,927
[SPEAKER_11]: And obviously we'll want to take a peek at that if we do make this recommendation so we can have that information for our MSBA project for a re-imagined high school.

101
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:45,849
[SPEAKER_11]: But that was sort of,

102
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:49,314
[SPEAKER_11]: It was nice that he came because it was very surprising.

103
00:07:49,414 --> 00:07:59,752
[SPEAKER_11]: I really had no strong sense of this issue, other than the facilities of the Curtis Tufts are challenging.

104
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,113
[SPEAKER_11]: I wrote

105
00:08:00,745 --> 00:08:19,670
[SPEAKER_11]: Four things, three things down, opportunities for students, which I just spoke to, facilities, which, you know, facilities at Curtis Tufts versus Medford High is one thing, but the facilities of the Curtis Tufts at a perhaps glossy, beautiful, new Medford High would be a different juxtaposition.

106
00:08:21,871 --> 00:08:23,591
[SPEAKER_11]: This little fly is gonna make me crazy.

107
00:08:25,472 --> 00:08:26,072
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyways,

108
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:34,696
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, we talked, I had talked, I can't remember with who about, you know, if we did bring the school over.

109
00:08:36,055 --> 00:08:45,380
[SPEAKER_11]: bring them together, maybe we can have a separate entrance, separate start and end times, some kind of partitioning if that actually is appropriate and okay and works.

110
00:08:46,200 --> 00:09:04,149
[SPEAKER_11]: But there were ways to retain, what I have heard is that the students in the Curtis Tufts and at other alternative high schools, the key for them is they're not with the rest of the student body or maybe even some of the staff, that they are in fact not there, that's the point.

111
00:09:06,403 --> 00:09:08,804
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I'm done talking and I would like to hear what anybody else.

112
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:09,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Ms.

113
00:09:09,604 --> 00:09:12,225
[SPEAKER_11]: Bowman, would you like to give us a little history lesson?

114
00:09:13,265 --> 00:09:13,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.

115
00:09:13,765 --> 00:09:16,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So the Curtis Tufts was created back in 1982.

116
00:09:17,486 --> 00:09:21,527
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's been longstanding part of Medford Public Schools.

117
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:26,208
[SPEAKER_08]: It is what we call our public day therapeutic program.

118
00:09:26,889 --> 00:09:27,829
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a small

119
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:33,991
[SPEAKER_08]: school setting for students who are on individualized education plans.

120
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:43,095
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the students have social emotional disabilities and the big setting of the high school is too much for them.

121
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:48,797
[SPEAKER_08]: We offer smaller classes, smaller teacher to student ratio.

122
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:53,179
[SPEAKER_08]: There is individual counseling, group counseling,

123
00:09:55,131 --> 00:10:02,718
[SPEAKER_08]: The, the, it's a more of a community within the Curtis Tufts, the staff and students eat lunch together.

124
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:11,847
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a lot, there's a community time breaks for them to to build relationships and have those staff members that they trust.

125
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:16,649
[SPEAKER_08]: while they are working on their academics to receive their high school diploma.

126
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:25,091
[SPEAKER_08]: So every student from Curtis Tufts earns the same amount of credits that Medford High School or Medford Vocational Technical High School student does.

127
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:28,993
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also have opportunities in which the students choose to

128
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:33,577
[SPEAKER_08]: participate in extracurricular activities here at Medford High School.

129
00:10:34,357 --> 00:10:36,459
[SPEAKER_08]: They can also be involved in sports.

130
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,527
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also have students who, when they're ready, they may want to transition to Medford High School for an academic class.

131
00:10:44,987 --> 00:10:47,369
[SPEAKER_08]: and we provide those opportunities for them.

132
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:50,551
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's very individualized for the students' needs.

133
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:52,993
[SPEAKER_08]: We have four academic teachers.

134
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:54,694
[SPEAKER_08]: We have two Councilors.

135
00:10:54,854 --> 00:11:05,101
[SPEAKER_08]: One is a school adjustment Councilor, and the other is a school Councilor slash guidance Councilor, as well as the principal, Dr. Laurie Hodgdon.

136
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:11,384
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been a great program that has provided a lot of services for students over the years.

137
00:11:13,085 --> 00:11:29,412
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm interested in hearing what the staff have to say about the possibility of being at the high school because I do think it will provide our students, even more opportunities, like the gentleman from full circle or full scale had had.

138
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:34,874
[SPEAKER_08]: communicated with us, there are pros and cons, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

139
00:11:35,574 --> 00:11:52,401
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what I'm interested in hearing, but I'm also, I'd like to see the Curtis Tufts be able to experience a newer school building and facilities and just, you know, let the students know that they are important to us and we value them as much as we do any other student in Medford.

140
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:56,562
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, that was helpful.

141
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:57,763
[SPEAKER_11]: I was not

142
00:11:58,502 --> 00:11:59,603
[SPEAKER_11]: on the school committee in 1982.

143
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:05,808
[SPEAKER_11]: I was 11, but so that's wonderful history.

144
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:14,134
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just ask, do you have any data on the size of the student population served during that time?

145
00:12:14,514 --> 00:12:21,640
[SPEAKER_11]: And I realized it varies dramatically even within a single year, but did it used to be much bigger or was it just two or three students when it started?

146
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:26,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, the Curtis Tufts previously had an enrollment up to 40 students.

147
00:12:27,391 --> 00:12:29,853
[SPEAKER_08]: So there were times that it was fully enrolled.

148
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:41,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also had opportunities to have students from other districts tuitioned into the Curtis Tufts because a lot, Everett, Malden, Revere, Chelsea did not have

149
00:12:42,273 --> 00:12:44,715
[SPEAKER_08]: their own public day programs at that time.

150
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:49,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And they also needed the type of services that the Curtis Tufts offers.

151
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,563
[SPEAKER_08]: So we were able to tuition in students and we have done that in the past.

152
00:12:55,845 --> 00:13:03,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Currently our enrollment varies from 15 to 20 students, but there is that opportunity to increase enrollment as well.

153
00:13:05,453 --> 00:13:06,273
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

154
00:13:08,857 --> 00:13:09,537
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great.

155
00:13:09,597 --> 00:13:18,780
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, mostly I know about the Curtis Tufts when we used to go for the delightful Thanksgiving dinners, which I, no pressure, but I would love it if those started again.

156
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,000
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really very nice.

157
00:13:23,061 --> 00:13:31,204
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'd like to hear from the staff, I think is really an important folks too, who are there every day.

158
00:13:39,252 --> 00:13:39,632
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.

159
00:13:41,374 --> 00:13:42,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Tom.

160
00:13:42,975 --> 00:13:44,557
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess I can go first and break the ice.

161
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:45,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Be the brave one.

162
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:46,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm new, right?

163
00:13:46,698 --> 00:13:48,940
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm new to the district, and I'm new to the team here.

164
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:54,685
[SPEAKER_06]: 16 years in education, working with at-risk youth, always as a special educator.

165
00:13:56,266 --> 00:14:03,533
[SPEAKER_06]: My experience in both settings has been different, and there are benefits, in my personal opinion, to both.

166
00:14:04,353 --> 00:14:25,588
[SPEAKER_06]: And in a program such as the one that we work in with Dr. Lori, we have an unbelievable ability to make immediate real time shifts and the way that we address student need and the locations that we're addressing those needs and providing opportunities for community based learning as well as space and separation.

167
00:14:25,988 --> 00:14:27,630
[SPEAKER_06]: when people need that time to process.

168
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,693
[SPEAKER_06]: So what we do here, we use the full space.

169
00:14:31,073 --> 00:14:39,061
[SPEAKER_06]: So the benefit of having this space is that we have the room to do what we need to do, not only for safety, but also for a student's growth trajectory.

170
00:14:39,441 --> 00:14:46,849
[SPEAKER_06]: So if a student needs to process for five minutes or think for five minutes before processing, we have the time and the space to be able to do that.

171
00:14:47,429 --> 00:15:04,856
[SPEAKER_06]: With that said, because we're at a separate location, one of the downsides to having the separate location and the cost of this space is that sometimes students can come in and say they feel like they've been... I'll be honest, I'm just going to use student language when they're angry.

172
00:15:05,296 --> 00:15:06,618
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like I've been thrown away.

173
00:15:07,099 --> 00:15:10,023
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that can be a challenge, right?

174
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:11,685
[SPEAKER_06]: That is not the truth.

175
00:15:11,845 --> 00:15:17,953
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the experience in the words that they sometimes, not in every case, used to describe that situation.

176
00:15:18,073 --> 00:15:19,135
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not specific to here.

177
00:15:19,155 --> 00:15:21,738
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a 16-year trajectory seeing these things happen.

178
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:42,568
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, when the programs are housed in the high school, I was, I founded a program in the Webster public school system which is in southern Worcester County, heavily DCF, DYS involved, a lot of generational poverty, multicultural, very diverse, with a lot of intense needs.

179
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:47,071
[SPEAKER_06]: which, by the way, congratulations to the superintendent.

180
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:54,656
[SPEAKER_06]: They were also in Enough Abuse Campaign District, and that work was amazing, so I just want to give a shout out there.

181
00:15:55,376 --> 00:16:07,645
[SPEAKER_06]: But with that said, what I saw in the building, when the program was housed in the building, benefits were that when a student had earned opportunities and shown good self-regulation, engagement, community skills,

182
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:17,508
[SPEAKER_06]: they did have opportunities to return for a period of day easier than it would have otherwise been to get a van to transport the kid back and forth, the student back and forth.

183
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:18,808
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was one advantage.

184
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:27,251
[SPEAKER_06]: A disadvantage was that a couple of times students showed up to the door looking for drama with students who were trying to separate themselves.

185
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:36,373
[SPEAKER_06]: They have said, I want to go to this alternative mindset and not stay in the mainstream mindset that I had of engaging in drama.

186
00:16:36,854 --> 00:16:37,694
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes when

187
00:16:38,675 --> 00:16:43,716
[SPEAKER_06]: in the same building, the drama found the student who had already made the decision to try to walk away.

188
00:16:44,196 --> 00:16:54,159
[SPEAKER_06]: And so when that drama follows them, it was sometimes hard for them to continue to maintain that separation between the decisions they'd made yesterday and the ones they want to make today.

189
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:59,880
[SPEAKER_06]: So I believe that there was a benefit, like I said, with the continuity between

190
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,561
[SPEAKER_06]: students in the broader community.

191
00:17:03,682 --> 00:17:14,550
[SPEAKER_06]: That said, the challenge was it wasn't always easy to separate from what that student was really truly trying to separate from, so they could move forward and re-engage when they were ready.

192
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:20,854
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't allow the full buffer that a separate location had otherwise offered in other years of my experience.

193
00:17:21,234 --> 00:17:23,796
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty much all I have to really say right now.

194
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:24,697
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to get wordy.

195
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:29,240
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to share that I worked in both, so I just wanted to give you my sense of some strengths and

196
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,980
[SPEAKER_06]: and challenges that we face in both.

197
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Are there any questions for me?

198
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:33,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Please.

199
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:34,921
[SPEAKER_11]: I have questions.

200
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:41,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Olapade, anybody else have questions before I go?

201
00:17:42,983 --> 00:17:43,984
[SPEAKER_11]: The buffer wasn't good enough.

202
00:17:45,104 --> 00:17:49,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Really, that's a key element of this conversation, frankly.

203
00:17:50,545 --> 00:17:52,926
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you describe what it was like there that

204
00:17:54,127 --> 00:17:59,832
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, was it just everybody came through the same main entrance of the schools or how was it laid out?

205
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:04,535
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm not asking for an architectural drawing or anything, but help me understand.

206
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:07,998
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a great question and I'm very glad you asked it.

207
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:18,086
[SPEAKER_06]: We, and I can also repeat that this situation existed not just in Webster, but also in Haverhill because I founded that program as well.

208
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:23,391
[SPEAKER_06]: And in both cases, I demanded access to an alternative entrance

209
00:18:24,488 --> 00:18:33,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I wanted students to be able to arrive five minutes after the buses or 10 minutes before the buses and not have to engage if they weren't feeling ready.

210
00:18:34,494 --> 00:18:39,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that student should have the right to say I'm not ready to engage in big community right now.

211
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:45,301
[SPEAKER_06]: and I need to work on my own self because that student is able to then advocate because that opportunity exists.

212
00:18:45,321 --> 00:18:46,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And without it, they couldn't ask for that.

213
00:18:47,322 --> 00:18:56,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So that buffer was important when it's in the building to be able to have a separate entrance, to be able to have a student who needs to leave and be able to leave through a separate entrance as well.

214
00:18:57,749 --> 00:19:01,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes they might leave with some colorful language and it might be a bit poetic.

215
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:07,315
[SPEAKER_06]: There might be some stomping and a door slamming, and there's no need for there to be secondary trauma for others.

216
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:15,098
[SPEAKER_06]: So that allowed us to give the student the space they needed to get to have their needs met and a safe way.

217
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:16,979
[SPEAKER_06]: So that separate entrance was key.

218
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:23,441
[SPEAKER_06]: The second thing we did was we were super intentional about where we chose to put the programs.

219
00:19:24,261 --> 00:19:27,823
[SPEAKER_06]: And we always chose based on access to the nurse.

220
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,795
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in a building, students are going to need to access the nurse.

221
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:39,482
[SPEAKER_06]: So we tried to make the nursing, our wing, connected based on where the nurse was.

222
00:19:39,822 --> 00:19:46,169
[SPEAKER_06]: So the nurse's office in Webster existed here, and then the wing started beyond that.

223
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,491
[SPEAKER_06]: So it worked perfectly.

224
00:19:47,511 --> 00:19:49,573
[SPEAKER_06]: In Haverhill, we had to make it

225
00:19:50,214 --> 00:19:54,196
[SPEAKER_06]: and a separate wing that was near the nurse's office.

226
00:19:54,617 --> 00:19:56,498
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was what we were doing there.

227
00:19:56,538 --> 00:20:00,540
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a super intentional thing we had to be mindful of based on entrances.

228
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:13,648
[SPEAKER_06]: A second reason for this is a lot of the students who end up in these therapeutic day school programs come with significant trauma histories as well as significant current anxiety and depression.

229
00:20:14,328 --> 00:20:17,110
[SPEAKER_06]: And when a student is not feeling like they are

230
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,733
[SPEAKER_06]: good enough for themselves, they don't want a large audience.

231
00:20:21,873 --> 00:20:24,634
[SPEAKER_06]: And we call a student with that profile an internalizer.

232
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:42,166
[SPEAKER_06]: So that student who's internalizing walks through the front door and sees two kids arguing, just might happen in any school in the country, and they immediately shut down for the rest of the day because their comfortable people weren't around, their safe zone wasn't immediately available, they had to navigate a hallway to get to it, and they had panic.

233
00:20:42,246 --> 00:20:45,188
[SPEAKER_06]: So they had to live with a panic attack without their supports nearby.

234
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,349
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that that's a challenge.

235
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:49,950
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we had that separate entrance, we had kids that were school.

236
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:54,352
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to use the word school avoidant because I don't choose to love the word school refuser.

237
00:20:55,693 --> 00:20:59,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had school avoidant kids who that was the change for them.

238
00:21:00,785 --> 00:21:09,451
[SPEAKER_06]: That I can come to school again because I can go through a separate entrance so if it's in the building that was my take that that separate entrance was key Haverhill was more complicated.

239
00:21:09,891 --> 00:21:19,358
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually had to get special permission for security to allow parents to drop off at around the back of the building where other parents are not allowed to drive during drop off.

240
00:21:19,918 --> 00:21:24,420
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to have security aware of what their cars were what they look like so they wouldn't stop them and let them through.

241
00:21:24,441 --> 00:21:39,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Then when the student went through, we had to have a system whereby they could be let in and have it be marked at the office so we would always stop at the principal clerk's office and they would timestamp the arrival so that it was official and on the books for safety and liability.

242
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:45,674
[SPEAKER_06]: And then if the student left through that separate entrance, they would have to leave through that same assistant principal's office.

243
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:54,541
[SPEAKER_06]: So we found a makeshift way to have a kind of like a main office for this sub-separate program because of where we made it proximate to.

244
00:21:54,701 --> 00:22:03,348
[SPEAKER_06]: So we made it proximate to another administrative office that could, that clerk could do the intake, outtake paperwork and make it official for attendance and liability and safety.

245
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:04,950
[SPEAKER_06]: It also helped with fire drills.

246
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:16,632
[SPEAKER_06]: and Alice and any kind of evacuation drills, because we were so close to our exits and our kids practiced them, that we had points that were not in the main lineup for a fire drill.

247
00:22:16,732 --> 00:22:18,752
[SPEAKER_06]: We were like, we went far beyond that.

248
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:22,393
[SPEAKER_06]: We went like another 200 yards past where everyone else lined up.

249
00:22:22,413 --> 00:22:25,914
[SPEAKER_06]: So our kids didn't have to be in the chaos while they were trying to recover from the loud noises.

250
00:22:27,034 --> 00:22:29,154
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's pretty much the long version of it.

251
00:22:30,075 --> 00:22:31,095
[SPEAKER_06]: But you asked a good question.

252
00:22:31,115 --> 00:22:32,035
[SPEAKER_06]: So I hope that was insightful.

253
00:22:32,867 --> 00:22:51,763
[SPEAKER_11]: It was, I mean, honestly, like the number of things to consider, like the fire drill location for these students, honestly, it would never have occurred to me, not that I'm asked to, but clearly there are a million and one little things that have to be considered if this decision is to co-locate.

254
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,346
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not just a matter of a set of classrooms.

255
00:22:55,867 --> 00:22:58,909
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a student who wouldn't leave the building.

256
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:03,205
[SPEAKER_06]: one day because they didn't want to go in the mass audience.

257
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:05,688
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then we immediately changed that.

258
00:23:05,768 --> 00:23:06,889
[SPEAKER_06]: So we learn as we go.

259
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:21,624
[SPEAKER_06]: And I anticipate that everyone who, if this happens, that it's cohabitating, I think everyone's going to have to keep an open, really open, flexible mind for that first year while the kinks get worked out, because there's going to be stuff that happens that can never be predicted.

260
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:35,463
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what we should do, I think, is predict that things that are unexpected are going to happen, and we need to just be prepared to not take it personal and just have honest, open communication and hard conversations that not everyone's going to agree on, but we're going to come to consensus.

261
00:23:35,843 --> 00:23:41,267
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are some of the challenges that we faced as teams in those two buildings where we had it in-house.

262
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:42,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

263
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:47,180
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a remarkably helpful set of information.

264
00:23:47,200 --> 00:24:03,765
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that, you know, when we're reimagining Medford High School, whether we rebuild or renovate, obviously nobody's surprised to know that I want to rebuild the new building, but, you know, like a separate entrance, that was like my thing.

265
00:24:05,462 --> 00:24:12,693
[SPEAKER_11]: There are really a long list, by the way, if we make this decision, I think it might be helpful for current Curtis Tufts staff.

266
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:39,848
[SPEAKER_11]: to just open a Google doc and start writing all the things you can think of, which may be important inputs to a design of a structure that, you know, those of us that are not there wouldn't consider because while we're not at the phase now where we're not doing the feasibility study right now and what the building might look like or where it would be or any of that stuff, that's all gonna come and that's gonna happen

267
00:24:40,783 --> 00:24:54,787
[SPEAKER_11]: it's gonna just, once we get through this first phase of eligibility, which is proving that we can do this work, it feels like that's gonna happen just like all at once.

268
00:24:55,307 --> 00:25:06,970
[SPEAKER_11]: And so any headstart you can get on a list of things that you think are important considerations in the design of a space, if that is inside or co-located.

269
00:25:08,367 --> 00:25:09,508
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know the rules.

270
00:25:09,948 --> 00:25:15,552
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't know if the state would physically a separate building right on the same property.

271
00:25:15,712 --> 00:25:20,035
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think any of us know the answer to what they think is acceptable.

272
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:24,299
[SPEAKER_11]: I think about things like food services, you brought up nursing.

273
00:25:24,699 --> 00:25:34,046
[SPEAKER_11]: There are other services for which having that, whether it's a separate wing or whether there's a little bridge, we talked a lot about bridges in one of our meetings.

274
00:25:34,146 --> 00:25:36,047
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody wants a bridge to their own program now.

275
00:25:37,844 --> 00:25:38,644
[SPEAKER_11]: which why not, right?

276
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:46,327
[SPEAKER_11]: But yeah, if you can, I'm guessing that like most of us, you will think of something you wish you had said later.

277
00:25:47,127 --> 00:25:48,327
[SPEAKER_11]: So write those things down.

278
00:25:48,367 --> 00:25:51,488
[SPEAKER_11]: You can send them to me or open a Google doc for your staff.

279
00:25:51,568 --> 00:25:52,528
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause I think that'd be great.

280
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:55,530
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, go ahead.

281
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Go ahead.

282
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,151
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm done.

283
00:25:57,231 --> 00:26:02,614
[SPEAKER_02]: So I actually did put together a Google Doc because I like spreadsheets.

284
00:26:04,195 --> 00:26:17,723
[SPEAKER_02]: So aside from the design of it, I have a list of benefits that we would love to see happen that would be available if we're co-locating, as well as concerns.

285
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:22,406
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also have some, I was talking to a few students today who have been here for

286
00:26:23,266 --> 00:26:29,269
[SPEAKER_02]: three plus years, who, you know, I presented the idea and what do you think of this?

287
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,851
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you mind if I just go through?

288
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:45,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we, so benefits we see to this happening is access to vocational programs, access to student support services like reading, speech, etc.

289
00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:46,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if a student does need that,

290
00:26:48,540 --> 00:27:02,569
[SPEAKER_02]: We do have speech pathologists come down and provide that service, but it's really not ideal because they're based in another school and scheduling is very difficult.

291
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:08,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Access to a nurse within the building would be helpful.

292
00:27:10,655 --> 00:27:27,512
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that feeling more included within the high school community because again they they do you know a lot of students who are newly placed here really struggle with the idea that they have been punished in some way that they've been thrown out.

293
00:27:28,132 --> 00:27:28,912
[SPEAKER_02]: by coming here.

294
00:27:29,292 --> 00:27:35,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally love it here and I chose to work here and this has been the best school year I've had.

295
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:44,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, I speak very highly of the community and, you know, we, we want to keep it growing.

296
00:27:44,316 --> 00:27:48,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we try and keep them, you know, make them feel welcome.

297
00:27:48,397 --> 00:27:53,518
[SPEAKER_02]: And usually when they come here, they're like, Oh, actually, this is kind of great.

298
00:27:54,318 --> 00:27:54,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

299
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:06,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, do access to athletics, drama, music programs, all of that, which, again, they do have access to, but transportation is the issue.

300
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:12,181
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the students today was like, yeah, I could still do that, but it's too much hassle.

301
00:28:12,301 --> 00:28:14,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just didn't do that.

302
00:28:15,743 --> 00:28:20,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, communication with events that are ongoing.

303
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:35,191
[SPEAKER_02]: would be helpful, like one student was saying today that she didn't even know when the junior prom was until she saw on social media that her peers were at the junior prom.

304
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:49,074
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's something that needs to be better handled right away to make sure that we're getting proper communication so that they can be included.

305
00:28:50,574 --> 00:29:01,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so yeah, it's, you know, benefits will be access to resources access to electives with their peers right now we have electives teacher coming.

306
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, coming from other schools, which, you know,

307
00:29:06,022 --> 00:29:25,201
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone who comes here is awesome and you know is great with the kids, but again it's not ideal, it's disruptive for them, the kids don't really know them because they're only here once a week, so you know having more consistent elective opportunities would be good.

308
00:29:26,362 --> 00:29:28,124
[SPEAKER_02]: So one student said

309
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:40,643
[SPEAKER_02]: she would feel less left out if they were, you know, whether it's the same building or like much closer than we are now.

310
00:29:42,404 --> 00:29:47,806
[SPEAKER_02]: She said it would be easier to join clubs and sports, which is too much of a hassle now.

311
00:29:47,826 --> 00:29:54,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And it would be nice to have the option to see more peers in the cafeteria for lunch, that sort of thing.

312
00:29:56,966 --> 00:30:00,268
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, as much as they like having lunch with us.

313
00:30:01,908 --> 00:30:18,397
[SPEAKER_02]: And then concerns I put together are, you know, the potential for peer drama, conflict, distractions from the larger community, which a lot of them are happy to no longer be a part of.

314
00:30:19,637 --> 00:30:24,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Unstructured time within the larger settings is gonna be very difficult.

315
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:51,510
[SPEAKER_02]: um flexibility within the curriculum so making sure that um we could so we're trying to do more project-based learning and so making sure we would still have flexibility to you know really individualize what these students need so a lot of them have social emotional behavior issues but they also have um you know learning disabilities as well so

316
00:30:52,450 --> 00:31:12,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I know this isn't on the table right now, but one of my concerns is that if we're within the same complex, I wouldn't want to lose a director of this program, because even though our numbers aren't huge, I understand that

317
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:30,715
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, you know, having taught in TLP before and understanding the other sub-separate special education programs, this is really unique and really different in the sense of community and how it's run.

318
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:38,197
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that would be really detrimental if we lost a director lead for that.

319
00:31:39,578 --> 00:31:39,938
[SPEAKER_02]: And then

320
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:43,971
[SPEAKER_02]: student concerns.

321
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:50,443
[SPEAKER_02]: One student said I needed to come to the Curtis because it was hard for me to be around so many people.

322
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:59,710
[SPEAKER_02]: she wanted to make sure there's an option for a quieter space for lunch and break time.

323
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:12,560
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the idea of having the flexibility there, so having the option, but some students either wouldn't choose it or it wouldn't be in their best interest.

324
00:32:13,901 --> 00:32:23,916
[SPEAKER_02]: And then one student said the high school would need to be way better organized in order to have the Curtis Tufts there to support us.

325
00:32:24,497 --> 00:32:28,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love the student feedback.

326
00:32:28,843 --> 00:32:30,524
[SPEAKER_02]: They were very forthcoming.

327
00:32:30,544 --> 00:32:33,204
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, oh, let me tell you what we think.

328
00:32:34,565 --> 00:32:36,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So I shared this document with you.

329
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,987
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I think of other things, I'll add to it.

330
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:45,469
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there are a lot of benefits.

331
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:50,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I think the separate entrance and exit would definitely be important.

332
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:55,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Having the space that is separated enough but not

333
00:32:56,232 --> 00:33:03,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Excluding, you know, having them missing out on these other resources, which brings me to my point of onboarding.

334
00:33:03,742 --> 00:33:08,588
[SPEAKER_06]: So when a student transitions and it's an internally placed housed program.

335
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:19,443
[SPEAKER_06]: if the student's need is such that they may not be appropriate for the large format cafeteria because of their special needs, that is a more restrictive environment.

336
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,024
[SPEAKER_06]: So we call that least restrictive LRE, right?

337
00:33:22,664 --> 00:33:35,449
[SPEAKER_06]: So in my opinion, my experience has been that we need to have a really specific conversation around LRE when we're in the same building, because the only way I found success

338
00:33:36,636 --> 00:33:37,677
[SPEAKER_06]: There can be many others.

339
00:33:37,817 --> 00:33:44,602
[SPEAKER_06]: The only one that I truly found that worked across a couple of settings was to have some type of a system of access whereby a student wants it.

340
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:49,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Two, they show that they're ready for it by meeting criteria that's measurable.

341
00:33:50,169 --> 00:33:54,672
[SPEAKER_06]: And then three, they have it once they get it, as long as they're able to continue to maintain that.

342
00:33:54,772 --> 00:33:56,073
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is a continuum.

343
00:33:56,533 --> 00:33:58,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So at some point, they can cave back in.

344
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:10,202
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes they'll see that caving back in as a punishment, because they want that cafeteria, they want that drama, and they want all 20 of those lunch tables staring at them when they confront this person about whatever issue.

345
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:14,725
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do have the potential for sticky situations.

346
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:27,029
[SPEAKER_06]: and having intentional conversations up front about the LRE can certainly alleviate some kind of litigiousness on the back end when people start to get into the draconian language of that and what does it mean.

347
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:36,993
[SPEAKER_06]: So proper expectations just need to be super clear in my opinion up front on that transition into the therapeutic day school program if it's housed in the same building.

348
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:41,195
[SPEAKER_06]: Like no kid here can complain that they can't access the cafeteria because

349
00:34:41,835 --> 00:34:42,556
[SPEAKER_06]: We're across town.

350
00:34:42,576 --> 00:34:45,638
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to get on a city bus and take it across town just to eat lunch.

351
00:34:46,599 --> 00:34:51,503
[SPEAKER_06]: But when it's 100 yards down the hall, they can sometimes dig their heels in and complain a bit.

352
00:34:52,684 --> 00:34:58,008
[SPEAKER_06]: So that being said, I just wanted to make sure that we didn't fail to mention that.

353
00:34:58,689 --> 00:34:59,569
[SPEAKER_06]: So access is great.

354
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:05,614
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll also need to manage the conversations around how, when, and for how long is appropriate, and so forth.

355
00:35:07,075 --> 00:35:07,295
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

356
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:07,736
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

357
00:35:07,776 --> 00:35:09,857
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a lot to digest.

358
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:29,693
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where we live, so it's like... We're really passionate about community and these students, they're, you know, they are overcoming so much all the time and, you know, we want them to be as successful as possible.

359
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:31,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

360
00:35:33,394 --> 00:35:34,754
[SPEAKER_11]: Lori, did you want to speak on anything?

361
00:35:35,578 --> 00:35:37,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, do I have the best staff in the city?

362
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:54,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't have much to say other than I get to lead them and manage and make it easier for them to do what they're doing, which is really good work, but also to be innovative and support students in a way that personalizes their learning, right?

363
00:35:54,574 --> 00:35:58,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, I see, I don't, I like to call it, you know,

364
00:35:59,898 --> 00:36:03,720
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities for improvement for all of our students.

365
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:08,062
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are re-imagining the high school, what does that look like?

366
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:26,292
[SPEAKER_03]: I think for someone who's been a principal of a small rural high school, a large suburban high school, a charter school director, I really, after COVID, and Joan knows this, was ready to work with kids who were the most marginalized.

367
00:36:27,409 --> 00:36:41,458
[SPEAKER_03]: And the most and the kids who are at promise and so for me I've been able to realize that here, but within that I'm thinking more systems and all students and the work that we're doing here needs to happen for every kid.

368
00:36:42,979 --> 00:36:56,992
[SPEAKER_03]: And so wouldn't it be cool to have a pilot of people doing project based learning that can push on other professionals and a larger high school scenario so I'm thinking they're thinking of the day to day I'm thinking big picture.

369
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:04,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And also what it means for kids to know, I agree, it needs to be a separate entrance.

370
00:37:04,959 --> 00:37:10,424
[SPEAKER_03]: We may have to have a small cafeteria, there needs to be a director, all of those things.

371
00:37:10,484 --> 00:37:19,152
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also think part of that is kind of thinking about how can we push on best practices in the high school that are evidence-based, right?

372
00:37:19,632 --> 00:37:24,136
[SPEAKER_03]: So that while we're working on those kids who need more support,

373
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:27,178
[SPEAKER_03]: in the Curtis Tufts environment, right?

374
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:32,422
[SPEAKER_03]: They're coming out of a high school that's very large that needs to be pushed in different ways.

375
00:37:32,922 --> 00:37:46,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that kind of mutual renewal, if Curtis Tufts was co-localized, I like that word, to the high school would be supportive with all of our students across the city that go to a very large high school.

376
00:37:47,512 --> 00:37:51,034
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, it's about like, what's good high school practice?

377
00:37:52,015 --> 00:37:54,517
[SPEAKER_03]: What's good practice for all students?

378
00:37:55,237 --> 00:38:08,704
[SPEAKER_03]: and also how do you lead folks so that, because special ed is just really good individualized instruction with really good goals, we should be doing something like this for every single kid, right?

379
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:13,867
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think I would love for it to be just professionally

380
00:38:14,407 --> 00:38:22,752
[SPEAKER_03]: we've talked about kids, wouldn't it be really cool to be an exemplar for other districts to see the work that we're doing with our kiddos, right?

381
00:38:23,393 --> 00:38:30,457
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I want, there are students and they don't, I'll tell you, they don't always feel like it's our.

382
00:38:31,878 --> 00:38:52,132
[SPEAKER_03]: they often feel, from my perspective, like they have been cast aside, even though intellectually we know that, but that's how they're feeling, because A, either they've come out of a situation that wasn't okay and there's a need for them to be here, or B, it's just they need a smaller learning environment.

383
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:56,646
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're asking themselves, well, why couldn't that happen in the high school?

384
00:38:57,347 --> 00:39:00,429
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of things that I'm kind of ruminating around.

385
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:03,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I think there needs to be a lot of research done.

386
00:39:04,612 --> 00:39:08,655
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've never been a principal having a sub-separate program.

387
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:17,361
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was a gen ed principal and principal of the whole, I think there's gonna be a lot that needs to be worked out, but in terms of access,

388
00:39:18,713 --> 00:39:28,780
[SPEAKER_03]: and universal design and equity, our kids deserve to be in the new re-imagined high school.

389
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:45,971
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just me, just, you know, I echo what everyone said, there are pros and there are cons to everything, but I think there needs to be a lot of research as we build a new high school around learning spaces and what, you know, I'll be excited to go and

390
00:39:47,934 --> 00:39:54,868
[SPEAKER_03]: see what other schools are doing because this is your building that you're going to have for the next 30 to 50 years, right?

391
00:39:55,529 --> 00:39:57,373
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it also has to be future ready.

392
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,076
[SPEAKER_03]: right for kids.

393
00:39:59,176 --> 00:40:01,978
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are just some things I'm thinking about.

394
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:06,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to answer any questions, also to get other folks' thoughts.

395
00:40:07,601 --> 00:40:13,465
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think you have a team that's ready and willing, and we just want to do the work.

396
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:22,850
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll continue to do the good work we're doing here at Curtis Tufts now and continue to accept feedback from folks and do what's right for our students.

397
00:40:24,671 --> 00:40:34,997
[SPEAKER_03]: We, I know, appreciate, and Tom and Nat and Leslie and Lance and Drew would have been here, but, you know, we were here representing.

398
00:40:35,357 --> 00:40:41,240
[SPEAKER_03]: So we appreciate the opportunity to be able, and we're happy to answer any questions.

399
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:42,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

400
00:40:42,401 --> 00:40:43,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

401
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:44,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

402
00:40:44,822 --> 00:40:45,283
[SPEAKER_09]: All that.

403
00:40:45,863 --> 00:40:47,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Aaron.

404
00:40:49,956 --> 00:40:53,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, it's a quick comment and something that I think many of you kind of spoke about.

405
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,343
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's also a culture thing.

406
00:40:55,803 --> 00:41:06,916
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that some students had mentioned that it felt like a punishment and not only the physical separation, but also the way in which I think the, the, the communication about what the program is actually intended for.

407
00:41:06,956 --> 00:41:09,479
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that's a thing that takes a long time.

408
00:41:10,286 --> 00:41:13,209
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a top-bottom kind of process.

409
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:30,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we really need to be informing our staff and ourselves about how these types of programs operate, the therapeutic benefits of them, right, and what they're actually intended to accomplish over the year or years that students might be participating in them so that it doesn't feel like it's a negative.

410
00:41:31,431 --> 00:41:33,132
[SPEAKER_04]: it just feels like school, right?

411
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:38,154
[SPEAKER_04]: And they just learn differently, they just have different needs, and we wanna accommodate them to the best of our ability.

412
00:41:38,474 --> 00:41:53,281
[SPEAKER_04]: And that comes from us understanding why each student's actually in the program, how we can be better fit to work with them, so they don't feel as though they're being, I think, yeah, penalized for having a different set of needs to learn effectively.

413
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:56,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not just the way that they're retaining content, right?

414
00:41:56,822 --> 00:41:58,383
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a variety of other things that I think

415
00:41:58,903 --> 00:42:07,886
[SPEAKER_04]: are individual to each of them, and I think, you know, I'm pro, I think, having the space be moved closer and closer to the high school as much as possible.

416
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:22,011
[SPEAKER_04]: I do really, I'm really interested on hearing more, I think, from students and faculty about how spaces are really important on smaller cafeterias, smaller spaces that are still in the building, for example, how we can offer

417
00:42:23,786 --> 00:42:25,607
[SPEAKER_04]: just less people, for even example, right?

418
00:42:25,687 --> 00:42:26,768
[SPEAKER_04]: How does that actually look?

419
00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:30,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Are those spaces going to always be just for the curse tough students?

420
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:34,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Can those be spaces be used by other classrooms or faculty when they're not being used?

421
00:42:34,935 --> 00:42:41,500
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we allow for all spaces to be used by multiple groups, if need be, so that it doesn't feel like it's separated?

422
00:42:42,280 --> 00:43:04,204
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that was something that I wondered about the Summerville program that we didn't get to really kind of elaborate on is how does their school, how does it integrate into the rest of the building, and is it just for their program, or do other groups use them throughout the school day, and how does that affect, I think, the students' perception about their stake in the school, if that makes sense.

423
00:43:04,584 --> 00:43:07,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Just something that I'm, as we're continuing talking about, I just thought it was really interesting.

424
00:43:08,227 --> 00:43:10,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I just talk a little bit about culture for a minute?

425
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:18,454
[SPEAKER_03]: So just for me, I think sometimes it's kids' reactions to moving to the Curtis Tufts.

426
00:43:19,155 --> 00:43:26,780
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that I can do a much better job of promoting Curtis Tufts and supporting other folks.

427
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Joan said it best.

428
00:43:28,821 --> 00:43:30,362
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a program that started in 1982 that's been

429
00:43:32,003 --> 00:43:37,586
[SPEAKER_03]: almost an institution that has supported all of our kids, but it has changed over time, right?

430
00:43:37,826 --> 00:43:41,767
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Marzano, who's an educational theorist, talks about the rule of 30.

431
00:43:41,928 --> 00:43:44,929
[SPEAKER_03]: It takes 30 years to lose a reputation.

432
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:53,153
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's a perception that all the bad kids went here, and I'm not constantly educating people about or

433
00:43:54,273 --> 00:44:06,201
[SPEAKER_03]: stakeholders about the fact that it's really designed for therapeutic learning so that you get what you need, both emotionally, socially, and academically, then that kind of sticks.

434
00:44:06,281 --> 00:44:11,604
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think we're doing a really good job as kids on board.

435
00:44:11,664 --> 00:44:13,585
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a reaction, of course, because it's changed.

436
00:44:13,645 --> 00:44:15,427
[SPEAKER_03]: No teenager likes to change anything.

437
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:17,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about the day-to-day, the 24 hours, the hour-by-hour.

438
00:44:19,269 --> 00:44:26,190
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do think that perception is changing as, and for me, it's been all about who I'm hiring for staff.

439
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:29,555
[SPEAKER_03]: and how they work with our students.

440
00:44:29,675 --> 00:44:38,043
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like I have an incredible team supported by Joan, Stacey Shulman, Maurice, the two assistant superintendents.

441
00:44:38,383 --> 00:44:41,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like we're allowed to be creative.

442
00:44:41,886 --> 00:44:44,989
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I've been in two high schools that have gone through building projects.

443
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:49,012
[SPEAKER_03]: And you talk a little bit, Aaron, about what does the design look like.

444
00:44:49,733 --> 00:45:08,315
[SPEAKER_03]: The school that I helped build in Vermont looked very different than the school, the mask and on it right so they built smaller learning communities, because they were focusing on freshmen coming from a regional kind of three towns, coming to a smaller because first year students struggle in high school.

445
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:11,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And they wanted to teach kind of academics, et cetera.

446
00:45:12,379 --> 00:45:15,842
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were housed in a different area from 10 through 12.

447
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:18,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And they really focused on teaming.

448
00:45:18,545 --> 00:45:21,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I think design of the whole high school will be really important.

449
00:45:21,107 --> 00:45:27,233
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why I'm saying, I think, and I haven't done any research about what the school of the future looks like with all of the technology.

450
00:45:27,293 --> 00:45:29,175
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's going to be really important stuff.

451
00:45:29,735 --> 00:45:33,919
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it will support a culture and community.

452
00:45:38,507 --> 00:45:38,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

453
00:45:38,967 --> 00:45:40,808
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that rule of 30.

454
00:45:41,128 --> 00:46:00,314
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's, I mean, it'd be interesting to, I mean, Aaron was a student not so long ago, but my guess is that 30 years is long gone, but I suspect that reputation is still there.

455
00:46:03,368 --> 00:46:05,590
[SPEAKER_03]: So- Can I just add one thing?

456
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:11,594
[SPEAKER_03]: Marzano also says that the rule of nine is you have to see it, hear it, to believe it for three years.

457
00:46:12,695 --> 00:46:18,939
[SPEAKER_11]: So- So having it in the same location would actually make a big impact on this.

458
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:19,459
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different.

459
00:46:19,499 --> 00:46:22,782
[SPEAKER_03]: So I agree with the Somerville for having someone who's never done this.

460
00:46:23,422 --> 00:46:30,107
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes sense to me what the Somerville principal or director said, that in itself can change a perception.

461
00:46:31,607 --> 00:46:33,508
[SPEAKER_03]: physical movement to a new building.

462
00:46:33,968 --> 00:46:51,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I think even, you know, definitely among students and families but staffing to like, we are so removed from all the other schools that nobody really knows what goes on they hear rumors that you know we we have a

463
00:46:52,217 --> 00:46:53,739
[SPEAKER_02]: A Councilor who's retiring.

464
00:46:53,799 --> 00:46:57,222
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been here for 27 years or something like that.

465
00:46:57,282 --> 00:47:02,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, Oh, you know, I always think it's funny when I hear about things that have happened here.

466
00:47:02,948 --> 00:47:06,631
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think I must have been out that day.

467
00:47:06,711 --> 00:47:07,112
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

468
00:47:08,976 --> 00:47:23,926
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think one way that having electives teachers come from other schools has kind of shed some light on that, where they're like, oh, this is not what I thought.

469
00:47:24,026 --> 00:47:25,767
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not chaotic.

470
00:47:25,907 --> 00:47:31,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, I firmly believe there are no bad kids.

471
00:47:32,431 --> 00:47:35,293
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel very, very strongly about that.

472
00:47:36,394 --> 00:47:37,034
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think,

473
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:39,836
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah.

474
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:41,937
[SPEAKER_11]: That used to be one heart, by the way.

475
00:47:41,957 --> 00:47:44,499
[SPEAKER_11]: Zoom just changed it.

476
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:45,299
[SPEAKER_11]: That was a flutter.

477
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:46,079
[SPEAKER_11]: It was awesome.

478
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,220
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

479
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,341
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel very strongly about that.

480
00:47:49,661 --> 00:48:03,909
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think having people from other buildings be with these kids, and some of them, you know, because they're coming from middle schools, they're coming from elementary schools, there are some staff that knew them from

481
00:48:04,588 --> 00:48:18,275
[SPEAKER_02]: previous schools, so they have some idea of who's over here, but I think their sense of what it is, what the program is, is different than the rumors.

482
00:48:19,576 --> 00:48:24,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I tell my former colleagues all the time that, you know, I love it.

483
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:26,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And I loved working at the Andrews.

484
00:48:27,961 --> 00:48:32,764
[SPEAKER_02]: But many of my former colleagues were like, what are you doing?

485
00:48:33,464 --> 00:48:37,547
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very happy with the choice that I made.

486
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:43,971
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I'm happy you've made that choice, because I think choosing something is different.

487
00:48:45,752 --> 00:48:52,456
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing I want to try to clarify, because we've all said it, and I just want to make sure that we don't leave a misunderstood component.

488
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So the profile of a student who's not

489
00:48:57,315 --> 00:49:06,105
[SPEAKER_06]: thriving in the broader, in the least restrictive environment, in the gen ed setting, there's a lot of learned helplessness that can happen in that.

490
00:49:06,826 --> 00:49:10,009
[SPEAKER_06]: There's generational poverty that some may be facing.

491
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:18,579
[SPEAKER_06]: And the excuse mindset or blaming mindset can sometimes be intrinsic and inherent in that person, regardless of what's happened.

492
00:49:19,426 --> 00:49:23,593
[SPEAKER_06]: And school and what the system has done to support them or or not.

493
00:49:24,334 --> 00:49:34,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to be clear that students that maybe had the most love and care and attention and dedication to their transition.

494
00:49:35,427 --> 00:49:46,934
[SPEAKER_06]: simply are unable to see that and by default will automatically say I've been tossed out even when there has been so much love and attention because I've been part of a transition here.

495
00:49:47,395 --> 00:49:50,817
[SPEAKER_06]: And I got to be honest, I'm very pleased with how that transition went.

496
00:49:51,657 --> 00:49:54,139
[SPEAKER_06]: Lori's done a great job of telling me what to expect.

497
00:49:54,899 --> 00:49:57,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Lori set up a meeting for me to meet with the student.

498
00:49:59,122 --> 00:50:01,083
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew what was going to happen before it happened.

499
00:50:01,283 --> 00:50:03,485
[SPEAKER_06]: I felt confident in that transition.

500
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:09,318
[SPEAKER_06]: But that said, no matter how much love and attention and intention is put into it.

501
00:50:09,899 --> 00:50:16,263
[SPEAKER_06]: We cannot control the words that come out of the mouths and the mindset the survival skills that have been developed over time.

502
00:50:16,903 --> 00:50:18,945
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes those ruts in the road run deep.

503
00:50:19,565 --> 00:50:24,669
[SPEAKER_06]: And no matter what we do, there will always be kids saying, I feel like I've been tossed out, whether it's in the building or not.

504
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:32,774
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to be clear that no one leaves here thinking that there's been any part of this conversation where anyone here is feeling like things aren't done right.

505
00:50:32,915 --> 00:50:35,256
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more that that's just the students' mindset.

506
00:50:35,296 --> 00:50:37,077
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's who we're meeting.

507
00:50:37,118 --> 00:50:40,760
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where we have to meet them, because we can't move forward if we don't meet them where they're at.

508
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,461
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's just a reality.

509
00:50:42,481 --> 00:50:46,584
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to make sure that's been clear, because there's nothing negative in the statement.

510
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:47,585
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a statement of fact.

511
00:50:49,158 --> 00:50:49,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

512
00:50:49,618 --> 00:50:50,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

513
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,921
[SPEAKER_11]: Just trying to keep an eye on the time.

514
00:50:58,284 --> 00:51:00,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Anybody else want to add anything?

515
00:51:02,346 --> 00:51:05,168
[SPEAKER_11]: This isn't like the only opportunity you'll ever have, by the way.

516
00:51:07,429 --> 00:51:18,836
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, I think that what I'm hearing, and frankly, so far I've heard really nobody arguing against us recommending this, you know,

517
00:51:20,126 --> 00:51:31,974
[SPEAKER_11]: We, you know, the way this would work is that one of those two school committee members make a motion and second it, and then presumably we would vote for making that recommendation that would go to the full school committee.

518
00:51:32,395 --> 00:51:37,798
[SPEAKER_11]: The school committee would make the policy decision that that is the goal.

519
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:44,203
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not like, you know, this isn't happening in September or anything like that, and that

520
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:49,245
[SPEAKER_11]: From there, that would become part of our educational profile for the new building.

521
00:51:50,285 --> 00:52:09,912
[SPEAKER_11]: And then of course, we're gonna probably have to really spend, we already spent a lot of time together, the people in this Zoom with me, but we're gonna have to spend even more time together to really, until we have like a site study and that stuff that happens in the next phase where we like, well, where could we put the building?

522
00:52:11,803 --> 00:52:28,013
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, could we renovate, which, whatever, you know, those are the kinds of starting points it feels like, you know, I like the bridges idea all over the place, metaphorically as well, but, you know, depending on where it is, it may not be possible.

523
00:52:29,174 --> 00:52:36,378
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel like, you know, we're gonna have to really dig in once we get to that point.

524
00:52:36,598 --> 00:52:41,021
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that for the eligibility phase, for the educational profile,

525
00:52:41,391 --> 00:52:50,496
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how much detail we have to actually go into in that, but we'll meet and discuss that, assuming that it passes tonight and that the full committee supports it.

526
00:52:53,357 --> 00:52:59,100
[SPEAKER_11]: I took copious notes, although there was so much more said, I'm sure.

527
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:04,803
[SPEAKER_11]: And I will try to write these up and just kind of highlight the, you know,

528
00:53:06,806 --> 00:53:11,771
[SPEAKER_11]: The key points in the event that the full school committee wants to really get into a dialogue about it.

529
00:53:12,592 --> 00:53:26,988
[SPEAKER_11]: And if they if they don't they just want to like, I don't say rubber stamp because that's that's such a negative connotation but if they just want to like yes we agree and move on, then we won't necessarily go through this whole presentation at the school committee meeting.

530
00:53:29,246 --> 00:53:31,288
[SPEAKER_11]: this certainly will not be the last.

531
00:53:31,328 --> 00:53:34,751
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like this is just the beginning, frankly, of this conversation.

532
00:53:35,311 --> 00:53:45,560
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not a six-month or a year-long conversation, which I think is good, because I really appreciate it.

533
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,322
[SPEAKER_11]: I try to remember who said this.

534
00:53:51,092 --> 00:54:10,626
[SPEAKER_11]: might've been Lori, forgive me, I forget who said this, but I do strongly believe that every one of these kinds of opportunities, whether it's a new high school, whether it's bringing the Curtis Tufts into the same campus, that there is no reason for us to not be an exemplar to other communities.

535
00:54:11,926 --> 00:54:15,609
[SPEAKER_11]: And even why limit ourselves to Massachusetts?

536
00:54:15,729 --> 00:54:19,712
[SPEAKER_11]: I was just looking at a video from a school in Oklahoma

537
00:54:20,165 --> 00:54:23,886
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, very different kind of a setting and they have a lot more land and all this other stuff.

538
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:38,430
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's no reason that when we're all done and we're all moved into a nice high school or new high school, that communities around the state and country aren't going, oh, look at this place, we could do this.

539
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:47,152
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, sometimes it would be difficult to put into a fun video when we're all done

540
00:54:47,711 --> 00:54:49,092
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, that makes a news story.

541
00:54:49,472 --> 00:54:52,894
[SPEAKER_11]: It's hard to put some of this stuff in particular into that.

542
00:54:52,914 --> 00:55:04,981
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, you know, are we going to really, is it, you know, is the news, you know, very, very brief stories going to include stuff like we brought our alternative, Joan, correct me, is it alternative high school therapeutic?

543
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Therapeutic.

544
00:55:06,782 --> 00:55:07,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

545
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:08,924
[SPEAKER_11]: I got to stop and fix that.

546
00:55:09,024 --> 00:55:11,265
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a note to remember to start calling it that.

547
00:55:11,753 --> 00:55:17,599
[SPEAKER_11]: therapeutic program into the main campus, that stuff's not going to make it.

548
00:55:17,699 --> 00:55:22,404
[SPEAKER_11]: But that doesn't mean we can't have a white paper when we're all done and say something so we can really help people.

549
00:55:22,764 --> 00:55:29,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we're reaching out to other school committees and other districts a lot.

550
00:55:30,492 --> 00:55:31,152
[SPEAKER_11]: How did it go?

551
00:55:31,192 --> 00:55:32,073
[SPEAKER_11]: What do you recommend?

552
00:55:32,253 --> 00:55:33,573
[SPEAKER_11]: So they're going to be doing that to us.

553
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:41,356
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think if we can really show that we did this and we did it really well, you really should consider it.

554
00:55:41,376 --> 00:55:45,718
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that does a service beyond just our students in Medford.

555
00:55:46,879 --> 00:55:49,440
[SPEAKER_11]: And I greatly appreciate it when other places do that for us.

556
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:53,701
[SPEAKER_11]: And they are very giving, sometimes surprisingly.

557
00:55:53,781 --> 00:55:55,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, can we have five hours to roam your school with you?

558
00:55:56,022 --> 00:55:59,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and then you have half their staff and they're like, don't you all have other things to do?

559
00:56:00,933 --> 00:56:29,750
[SPEAKER_11]: But so if nobody has anything else they want to add, if member Olapade would like to make a motion to recommend that the Curtis Tufts, I'm writing it down, the Curtis Tufts be co-localized, I am in love with that by the way, co-localized with the main Medford High School

560
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:38,574
[SPEAKER_11]: campus, because it is part of Medford High still, you know, I just, does that language sound okay to the folks that understand this stuff in detail?

561
00:56:39,615 --> 00:56:41,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Good, okay, I saw a thumbs up.

562
00:56:41,896 --> 00:56:44,837
[SPEAKER_11]: So if member Olapade would like to make that motion.

563
00:56:45,718 --> 00:56:47,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I do, I would like to make that motion.

564
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:48,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Wonderful.

565
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,961
[SPEAKER_04]: To discuss it with the rest of the committee.

566
00:56:51,501 --> 00:56:51,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

567
00:57:00,976 --> 00:57:05,238
[SPEAKER_11]: just typing it, but I wanna have Mr. Don't vote if we don't know what we're saying.

568
00:57:05,278 --> 00:57:19,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Recommendation to co-localize Curtis Tufts with the main Medford High School campus by member Olapade, seconded by member Rousseau.
