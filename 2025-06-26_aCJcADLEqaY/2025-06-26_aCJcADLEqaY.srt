[SPEAKER_12]: Alicia Hunt, the director of our office, probably won't be in attendance tonight.

18
00:00:56,404 --> 00:00:59,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Though if you see her on a little bit later, don't be surprised.

19
00:00:59,918 --> 00:01:01,519
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and that's it for tonight.

20

[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and so the first item that we have on our agenda for this evening is 2 43 mystic Avenue.

23
00:01:13,589 --> 00:01:19,013
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I believe this, this is a public meeting, so I will read the public meeting notice.

24
00:01:20,855 --> 00:01:24,578
[SPEAKER_04]: The method community development board shall conduct a public hearing on July 19th.

25
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:28,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, I'm not sure if I have.

26
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:37,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Pardon me, Amanda, do I have the correct meeting notice?

27
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:40,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, 243 Mystic Me.

28
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

29
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:43,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Apologies.

30
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:49,616
[SPEAKER_04]: It was actually moved to today's meeting, so perhaps that was the mix-up.

31
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly, yes.

32
00:01:51,418 --> 00:01:52,399
[SPEAKER_12]: The notice is the same.

33
00:01:52,419 --> 00:01:55,902
[SPEAKER_12]: The date was our original hearing date, which was continued to today.

34
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:57,222
[SPEAKER_04]: which was continued.

35
00:01:57,922 --> 00:02:00,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And do I need to make reference to that or just gloss over the.

36
00:02:01,446 --> 00:02:02,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yeah.

37
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:06,851
[SPEAKER_04]: To start over the medical community development board shall conduct a public hearing on August 2 2023.

38
00:02:07,572 --> 00:02:08,533
[SPEAKER_04]: After 6pm via zoom, the remote

39
00:02:12,317 --> 00:02:28,966
[SPEAKER_04]: veto conferencing relative to a petition by 243 Mystic Avenue LLC at 45 West 3rd Street, Boston Mass, 02127, to amend zoning map, City of Medford Mass, dated April 13th, 1965, as referenced in Medford's zoning ordinance chapter 94, 2.2.

40
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:39,412
[SPEAKER_04]: The amendment proposes to change the zoning district designation of the property 243 Mystic Avenue as depicted on the plan entitled site layout plan, dated June 15th, 2023,

41
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:52,117
[SPEAKER_04]: from commercial to C2 zoning district to a planned development district, which is a PDD and have, which would have new development standards for Metro zoning ordinance chapter 94, 9.23.

42
00:02:54,398 --> 00:02:58,398
[SPEAKER_04]: The full materials for the amendment can be viewed in the office of planning.

43
00:02:59,138 --> 00:03:02,539
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, Amanda has already shared that link with everyone.

44
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:07,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda, do you actually,

45
00:03:08,983 --> 00:03:14,625
[SPEAKER_04]: do you want to introduce this next, do you want to introduce who's here for this topic?

46
00:03:15,205 --> 00:03:15,826
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

47
00:03:15,846 --> 00:03:16,166
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

48
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:28,111
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and I just posted in the chat sort of definition and like criteria when evaluating planned development districts, just in case anyone is interested.

49
00:03:28,951 --> 00:03:33,893
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's there and the board will be using this framework for evaluating the application.

50
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:41,896
[SPEAKER_12]: And with that, I'm going to cede the floor to the applicant with the CI design team.

51
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:46,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Are you guys on and able to present?

52
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,578
[SPEAKER_06]: We are.

53
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:49,098
[SPEAKER_06]: We are.

54
00:03:49,118 --> 00:03:50,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear us okay?

55
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, perfect.

56
00:03:53,887 --> 00:03:56,869
[SPEAKER_06]: We decided it to be in a room together would be the best option.

57
00:03:56,929 --> 00:03:58,931
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm attorney Jim Heffernan.

58
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:00,292
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm with rich may PC.

59
00:04:00,952 --> 00:04:04,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I represent the proponent burden bio.

60
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:07,838
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also here with CI design and also.

61
00:04:09,405 --> 00:04:11,346
[SPEAKER_06]: with Steve on our behalf.

62
00:04:12,807 --> 00:04:28,497
[SPEAKER_06]: So the purpose of tonight is for the CDB to approve the PDD zoning, the zoning draft that I worked on with the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability, as well as the city attorney.

63
00:04:29,577 --> 00:04:36,141
[SPEAKER_06]: The second part of it is to also prove the location on the zoning map for this to be part of that PDD.

64
00:04:37,542 --> 00:04:51,566
[SPEAKER_06]: As part of that, we're going to give a brief summary of the project, the proponent, and then I'll go in kind of more into the detailed analysis under the zoning code, the zoning location, and the draft PDD.

65
00:04:51,646 --> 00:04:53,767
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that, I'll turn it over to Doug.

66
00:04:55,181 --> 00:04:55,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everybody.

67
00:04:57,603 --> 00:04:59,964
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a couple of conversations.

68
00:04:59,984 --> 00:05:01,785
[SPEAKER_01]: So I see a lot of familiar faces.

69
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:04,787
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there are a couple of new people on the board.

70
00:05:04,827 --> 00:05:08,189
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just give a brief description of who Verdant is.

71
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:10,510
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here with my partner Khadijah Hindi.

72
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,194
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are a life science development company coming at

73
00:05:16,574 --> 00:05:19,796
[SPEAKER_01]: development of the lab space from a scientist perspective.

74
00:05:19,816 --> 00:05:22,938
[SPEAKER_01]: So both Khadijah and I are PhD chemists.

75
00:05:23,418 --> 00:05:25,800
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a lot of lab research at Harvard.

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,224
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the last 10 years, in combination with that research, we've also been doing real estate development.

77
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:36,507
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this project is meshing both of our

78
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:40,191
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences over about the last 10 to 15 years.

79
00:05:41,312 --> 00:05:47,900
[SPEAKER_01]: And we think that this site is a really good location for a life science project in Medford.

80
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,530
[SPEAKER_01]: So excited to be here, excited to tell you a little bit more about the project and answer any questions that you might have.

81
00:05:57,672 --> 00:06:05,215
[SPEAKER_06]: and then turn over CI design to go run through a brief update on the project or show you what's been shown before.

82
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:07,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, thanks very much, Jim.

83
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:11,157
[SPEAKER_08]: And let's see, do we have the- Go back to Zoom.

84
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:13,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Go back to Zoom, yeah.

85
00:06:13,538 --> 00:06:14,479
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, there we are.

86
00:06:15,019 --> 00:06:16,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Share screen here.

87
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,261
[SPEAKER_00]: The green one at the bottom.

88
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,123
[SPEAKER_12]: If you guys don't mind, am I interrupting for a moment?

89
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:25,363
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

90
00:06:28,162 --> 00:06:37,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Through the chair, I did want to just point out for the board that our office has been working with attorney Gareth Orsmond on this application.

91
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:53,380
[SPEAKER_12]: And attorney Orsmond is here and available tonight to advise the board, to answer questions, whether it be on procedures or sort of logic behind maybe different choices around the draft amendment, all of that.

92
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,743
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to point out that he's available here

93
00:06:57,643 --> 00:06:59,124
[SPEAKER_12]: for the board's advisement as well.

94
00:07:00,224 --> 00:07:00,964
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I'll thank you.

95
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:01,265
[SPEAKER_09]: I am.

96
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:01,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

97
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:05,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, Madam Chair.

98
00:07:05,586 --> 00:07:07,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Happy to chime in when you ask any questions.

99
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:10,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much, Attorney Osmond, for being here with us.

100
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:19,752
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the other things that I wanted to note for our board members is that this is the proponent will most likely present a high-level conceptual presentation.

101
00:07:20,272 --> 00:07:26,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Our task is to focus on zoning, the uses and dimension at this step for the proposed parcel.

102
00:07:27,417 --> 00:07:29,260
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not yet at the site review.

103
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, as far as the vision and visuals and things like that, so we're, the onus is zoning.

104
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:37,513
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I just wanted to, um, iterate that.

105
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:40,690
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that, Madam Chair.

106
00:07:41,571 --> 00:07:42,652
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Matthew Jarros.

107
00:07:42,732 --> 00:07:51,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a principal at CI Design, and I'll take us through sort of a graphic description of the proposed building.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,885
[SPEAKER_08]: And as was mentioned earlier, we've started this process with the city last year.

109
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:59,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we met with the mayor.

110
00:08:00,288 --> 00:08:00,809
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had

111
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:08,453
[SPEAKER_08]: for previous informal meetings with the CD board and thank you for your time and the valuable input.

112
00:08:09,014 --> 00:08:18,860
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the proposal that we're here to discuss tonight is the result of all of that time and collaborations.

113
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:26,461
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, as Doug and Khadija mentioned, this is a life science building.

114
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:34,647
[SPEAKER_08]: And what it is, is the speculative building that focuses on small startup tenants, of which there's sort of a

115
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:39,732
[SPEAKER_08]: continuous pipeline in eastern Massachusetts.

116
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:46,879
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the site is on the corner of Harvard Street and Mystic Avenue.

117
00:08:46,899 --> 00:09:02,093
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very small and tight site, and then we intend to build up to the lot lines of our neighbor within a couple of feet to the north, and I think within 18 inches to the west.

118
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:06,437
[SPEAKER_08]: and then right up to the lot line on the sidewalk side.

119
00:09:07,017 --> 00:09:16,186
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll take you through just a quick sort of orientation about the salient features of the building and sort of parts and how it functions quickly.

120
00:09:18,749 --> 00:09:22,292
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a parking entrance, a vehicle entrance off of Harvard Street.

121
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:26,335
[SPEAKER_08]: We located that as far from the intersection as the site allows.

122
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:31,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So vehicles would enter in this area of the building and we've got

123
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:42,163
[SPEAKER_08]: cars can migrate over to the parking area where we've got a parking system which will allow for the parking of 18 cars.

124
00:09:42,243 --> 00:09:52,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I think these are three, six bays of three up and one down and then two regular spaces for 20 total.

125
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:53,490
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got a bike room,

126
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,451
[SPEAKER_08]: back over on this side.

127
00:09:56,511 --> 00:10:04,174
[SPEAKER_08]: And then any science building, a lab building, really has as its heart the loading dock and utility elevator.

128
00:10:04,194 --> 00:10:07,296
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's sort of where we start the design.

129
00:10:07,416 --> 00:10:13,798
[SPEAKER_08]: And so vehicles doing pickup and delivery would back right into this area here.

130
00:10:14,118 --> 00:10:17,140
[SPEAKER_08]: That's located right next to the utility elevator and a stair.

131
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,281
[SPEAKER_08]: And then sort of continuing in the back of the house areas,

132
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:26,745
[SPEAKER_08]: chemical storage, mechanical rooms, and utility rooms.

133
00:10:26,765 --> 00:10:34,269
[SPEAKER_08]: There's also a mechanical mezzanine above this level with mechanical equipment for the building that's not on the roof is located.

134
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,752
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's all sort of entering from Harvard Street as a vehicle.

135
00:10:39,433 --> 00:10:49,099
[SPEAKER_08]: Pedestrians and bicyclists and folks who arrive via public transportation might choose to use the vestibule at the main corner of the

136
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:55,704
[SPEAKER_08]: The site, and there's a lobby right in that area with the passenger elevator that goes upstairs.

137
00:10:56,705 --> 00:10:59,047
[SPEAKER_08]: We have 8, 8 floors total.

138
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:03,711
[SPEAKER_08]: The building, there's a reception and lobby area.

139
00:11:05,693 --> 00:11:06,854
[SPEAKER_08]: egress stairs and so forth.

140
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:23,190
[SPEAKER_08]: The typical floors as we've got them laid out currently, folks will arrive usually using the passenger elevator and sort of at the front of the buildings is a glassy front as we've envisioned it.

141
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,231
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to make some

142
00:11:24,871 --> 00:11:33,936
[SPEAKER_08]: visions as we get the new building code enforced when this is successful as this project moves forward in the coming year.

143
00:11:34,437 --> 00:11:38,559
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to change that exterior some, but we're envisioning it to be glass currently.

144
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:50,743
[SPEAKER_08]: And behind the elevator are a series of lab benches and these could be demised in smaller spaces or in a single large space per floor.

145
00:11:51,043 --> 00:12:04,326
[SPEAKER_08]: Lab buildings and facilities of this sort have several different parts that serve the lab benches and the science that's being done collecting data in the quote-unquote lab support rooms over on the left.

146
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:20,814
[SPEAKER_08]: have different types of instruments that might be used, microscopes, centrifuges, things of this nature, refrigerator farms, where different mediums and so forth are stored and prepared.

147
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,475
[SPEAKER_08]: We call that lab support.

148
00:12:23,236 --> 00:12:30,079
[SPEAKER_08]: And a little known fact, an important part of any lab is actually a

149
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,220
[SPEAKER_08]: um, an office component.

150
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:45,242
[SPEAKER_08]: So every scientist student, the white coat, who's, who's doing science on a lab bench also spends an equal or greater amount of time sitting at a desk, um, doing data analysis and research and so forth.

151
00:12:45,282 --> 00:12:59,385
[SPEAKER_08]: And so all of the offices is, um, located in, in, in these lower sections here, those are open cubicles as we're envisioning them, some open office area to the right and enclosed conference room to the left, uh, toilet rooms and, and, um,

152
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:02,367
[SPEAKER_08]: more building utilities and so forth at the top.

153
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:17,340
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's going to be a large amount of the floor area that's dedicated to vertical duct space and shaft space because of the large ventilation requirements for lab buildings.

154
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,642
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we're going to go migrate down.

155
00:13:20,663 --> 00:13:22,984
[SPEAKER_08]: The exterior of the building in elevation

156
00:13:25,103 --> 00:13:38,955
[SPEAKER_08]: It contains the treatment of the two facades that face Harvard Street and Mystic Ave, which we're envisioning as largely glass with a series of sort of sculptural fins that have a vertical emphasis.

157
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:48,083
[SPEAKER_08]: And the two solid walls that face our neighbors, we're envisioning would have a pretty similar

158
00:13:48,963 --> 00:14:00,958
[SPEAKER_08]: type of execution with the sculpted shaped fins in front of a wall that is not going to be the glass wall but a more solid wall.

159
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,664
[SPEAKER_08]: This is sort of a diagrammatic look at how lab buildings lay out and

160
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:10,248
[SPEAKER_08]: how we're envisioning this one.

161
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:17,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Take note of the pretty large mechanical penthouse at the roof.

162
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:28,458
[SPEAKER_08]: This building is going to require 100% make-up air and a large velocity of exhaust air, and the equipment gets pretty large.

163
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:31,380
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to have backup power for all of it.

164
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Data collection and science is really about valuable information.

165
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:44,106
[SPEAKER_08]: running experiments requires power and so having backup power is vital for a facility like this.

166
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:50,550
[SPEAKER_08]: This building is being developed with a tenant in mind, a single tenant that that caters to startups.

167
00:14:51,090 --> 00:15:00,234
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of their concept is that there would be on-site dining and studio space that is available for aggregating their

168
00:15:01,975 --> 00:15:08,682
[SPEAKER_08]: their data, doing public outreach, doing funding outreach, and supporting functions of that sort.

169
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:09,943
[SPEAKER_08]: That's called the studio.

170
00:15:10,584 --> 00:15:14,188
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we stack the lab floors below that.

171
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:21,015
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can see that on the lower level, there's a mechanical mezzanine storage and so forth.

172
00:15:21,055 --> 00:15:24,038
[SPEAKER_08]: And these are building sections, so looking at the building vertically.

173
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:32,328
[SPEAKER_08]: And the last piece is just to place the building a little bit more discreetly on the site.

174
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:37,512
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can see Mystic Ave here in Harvard Street on the bottom.

175
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:43,116
[SPEAKER_08]: Our neighbors to the north and to the west are right there.

176
00:15:43,136 --> 00:15:48,120
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a quick overview of the building that we're proposing.

177
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,885
[SPEAKER_08]: I turn it back over to Tony Effernon to describe the ordinance that we're proposing.

178
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,459
[SPEAKER_08]: we're writing for this building.

179
00:15:57,739 --> 00:15:58,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Matt.

180
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,920
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was all helpful.

181
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, as Madam Chair pointed out, the purpose tonight is not to approve this actual project in use.

182
00:16:08,743 --> 00:16:17,525
[SPEAKER_06]: This is for the approval of the PDE that we've proposed and worked on with the Office of Planning, Development, Sustainability and their attorney.

183
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:31,749
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, tonight's request for this new PDD, it's pursuant to section 94-9.2 in the Recodified Medford Zoning Ordinance.

184
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:37,410
[SPEAKER_06]: Under that ordinance, there's essentially two types of PDDs, commercial and residential.

185
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:42,951
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can see tonight, as explained by Matt, this is a commercial version of that variety.

186
00:16:43,271 --> 00:16:48,153
[SPEAKER_06]: More specifically, life sciences, research and development, lab, office space use.

187
00:16:49,813 --> 00:17:06,852
[SPEAKER_06]: The purpose and intent of that section 94-9.2 is to permit a new development standard for particular use for a particular site, give a little bit more specific details of what are needed for that site.

188
00:17:07,213 --> 00:17:09,055
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's exactly what our ask here is tonight.

189
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:13,638
[SPEAKER_06]: we're in the commercial two zone, which allows some of these uses.

190
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:16,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the dimensional requirements don't quite match.

191
00:17:17,942 --> 00:17:33,313
[SPEAKER_06]: And the request, because the unique features, the site and the use, it was determined from many discussions with the Office of Development, Planning, Development and Sustainability to move and apply for the PDD.

192
00:17:34,214 --> 00:17:38,439
[SPEAKER_06]: Before going to that ordinance, it's worth kind of putting it on perspective.

193
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:42,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight is step three of a nine-step process.

194
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:50,634
[SPEAKER_06]: The first step of that was a pre-application review, which we did do in June.

195
00:17:52,528 --> 00:17:54,970
[SPEAKER_06]: highlighting much of the project that Matt just went over.

196
00:17:56,171 --> 00:18:00,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Step two was filing the PDD application, which was also completed.

197
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:05,739
[SPEAKER_06]: And once that was filed, I believe at the end of June, maybe the first part of July,

198
00:18:07,981 --> 00:18:22,597
[SPEAKER_06]: the city engaged uh attorney oarsman and we uh worked together uh all of july and up until end of last week to uh prepare this draft uh pdd uh so that puts us here tonight in step three this is

199
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:35,611
[SPEAKER_06]: really the application review and public hearing for for your approval of the draft PDD and the zoning location.

200
00:18:36,092 --> 00:18:41,598
[SPEAKER_06]: This will then move forward if you accept and approve for your recommendation to the city council.

201
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:43,760
[SPEAKER_06]: There are

202
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:46,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Many other public hearings planned.

203
00:18:47,306 --> 00:18:56,762
[SPEAKER_06]: So you will not, this will not be the last time you see it and you're going to see a much more detailed site plan review process in accordance with the PDD and your zoning ordinance.

204
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:07,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, that's just to highlight approvals for the PDD and the location, and that this is going to come back around for you.

205
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:13,854
[SPEAKER_06]: On those two goals, location I think is the easiest one to hammer out.

206
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:19,957
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a 8,177 square foot parcel.

207
00:19:20,457 --> 00:19:23,378
[SPEAKER_06]: It's on the corner of Mystic Avenue and Harvard Street.

208
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:38,983
[SPEAKER_06]: It's known as 243 Mystic Avenue, and it's been depicted on a survey plan, which is part of the application on file with the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, and it's been presented to you before.

209
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:44,064
[SPEAKER_06]: This area transitions from commercial use to residential use.

210
00:19:45,004 --> 00:19:51,446
[SPEAKER_06]: It can be developed as a buffer between a predominantly residential neighborhood on the west and a more industrial on the east.

211
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:56,028
[SPEAKER_06]: We traverse over many busy roadways.

212
00:19:56,048 --> 00:20:01,929
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the busiest in the country, I-93, Mystic Avenue and Mystic Avenue Parkway.

213
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,651
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is our location that we're asking you to approve tonight.

214
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:14,861
[SPEAKER_06]: On the draft PDD, we're happy to run through every text and detail, and Gareth and I can go over those with you as well.

215
00:20:16,463 --> 00:20:23,812
[SPEAKER_06]: This was, as already highlighted, negotiated pretty extensively over the last, really over the last three weeks proactively, and

216
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:35,359
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think we're at a happy compromise in place with working with both the Office of Planning, Development, Sustainability and your attorney.

217
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,520
[SPEAKER_06]: I do want to highlight a couple key aspects of it.

218
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:45,763
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also highlighted in Attorney Osmond's memo filed with you as well.

219
00:20:47,564 --> 00:20:51,826
[SPEAKER_06]: As required by the zoning ordinance, the City Council is the special permitting granting authority.

220
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:53,386
[SPEAKER_06]: So you see that highlighted throughout.

221
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,143
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still a site plan review process with the CDB.

222
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:13,160
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is also in the draft PDD that may be contemporaneous with our process with the City Council so that we'll have a kind of a use and then a more of a design and site plan review process with you.

223
00:21:14,922 --> 00:21:22,230
[SPEAKER_06]: The City Council City Attorney recommended I think Gareth had a great idea on this concept of a cooperation agreement in there.

224
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,232
[SPEAKER_06]: He explains that a little further in his memo.

225
00:21:24,553 --> 00:21:25,634
[SPEAKER_06]: We're happy to talk about tonight.

226
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:35,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to highlight that you know this this allows more complex issues to be hammered out with the City Council so they can approve some of these

227
00:21:36,185 --> 00:21:40,428
[SPEAKER_06]: complex aspects of a project such as this.

228
00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:44,712
[SPEAKER_06]: It helps a cooperative environment between the city and the developer.

229
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:50,856
[SPEAKER_06]: It is not a replacement site plan review, so it's not taking away anyone's authority or your authority out of that.

230
00:21:51,196 --> 00:21:52,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So I thought that was a nice addition.

231
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:55,680
[SPEAKER_06]: It is also very common in PDDs or in other

232
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,141
[SPEAKER_06]: areas known other cities or communities known as a PUD.

233
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:01,862
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a nice nice add.

234
00:22:02,503 --> 00:22:04,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Another element in there is the linkage.

235
00:22:05,744 --> 00:22:06,624
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a a

236
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:26,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's important part of the process, any projects, major projects in Medford require linkage fee and in here is an element of a like kind work and kind exchange of work of equal or greater value to that linkage fee.

237
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes the developer has an easier

238
00:22:30,492 --> 00:22:35,775
[SPEAKER_06]: way of doing streetscape improvements, park improvements, pedestrian improvements, and things like that.

239
00:22:36,795 --> 00:22:50,142
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not meant to circumvent the city regulations either, so as you'll see in the draft PDD, it still gives control to the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, which is as is in the City of Medford.

240
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:54,485
[SPEAKER_06]: uses and there's a extensive use chart there.

241
00:22:55,165 --> 00:23:10,153
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to draw out that yes there's a lot of uses in that use chart that's to mere C2 the zoning district but really the proposed use here is life science research development lab space with office and ancillary uses.

242
00:23:11,714 --> 00:23:15,536
[SPEAKER_06]: The PDD already references the preliminary plan and plan submitted.

243
00:23:15,636 --> 00:23:23,661
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not like we can go off plan dramatically without having to come back and reinvent the wheel, which we have zero intention to do.

244
00:23:24,181 --> 00:23:27,002
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's why I wanted to highlight kind of the use chart there.

245
00:23:28,904 --> 00:23:31,166
[SPEAKER_06]: And last but not least, the dimensional chart.

246
00:23:31,246 --> 00:23:38,833
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we can go through each item, but I think Matt's summary helps tie in the dimension and why the dimensional chart is structured that way.

247
00:23:40,454 --> 00:23:43,397
[SPEAKER_06]: These are directly connected to the proposed project.

248
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:48,020
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, particularly maximum height.

249
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,782
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just want to highlight, you know, it's not like the building itself is 160 feet.

250
00:23:53,803 --> 00:24:07,890
[SPEAKER_06]: There is a substantial mechanical area and some care and attention was given to that with us and Office of Planning and with attorney between both attorneys on the correct wording on

251
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:29,473
[SPEAKER_06]: that uh that pen yeah they're showing the MEP penthouse so all the mechanicals and equipment uh will take up a significant space up there and you'll see that there is language in there about screening which is already proposed in the preliminary plan so uh care and attention was really given into that screening and height element of that um

252
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:58,928
[SPEAKER_06]: that's in conclusion that's that's what we're asking for or you know i'm asking for your approval of both the location on the zoning map and approval of this draft pdd um happy to answer any other detailed questions got the whole team here uh uh and uh we'll open the board and again uh if it hasn't been said already thank you very much for uh hearing us tonight thank you attorney heffman i i we appreciate it um

253
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:14,718
[SPEAKER_04]: your detailed of the uses and you're going back and forth with, you know, just giving us, filling us the new board members in from previous meetings.

254
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:29,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I open it up, Amanda, I'm not sure if we should have Attorney Orzman step in here and pretty much set the stage before we get to the public comment, or should we go straight to the public comment first?

255
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:43,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe I'll ask Attorney Orzman, is there anything that you want to add as far as framing for the conversation or any additional bits that you think might be helpful to kick us off?

256
00:25:47,205 --> 00:26:09,717
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just to reiterate it, it was a collaborative and reiterative process, but we had a lot of majority of say in the drafting of the proposed rezoning ordinance, just to make it clear, this is very much what we had in mind.

257
00:26:10,998 --> 00:26:12,359
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, well,

258
00:26:13,935 --> 00:26:20,518
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we can hear comments, we can revise it before it goes to city council.

259
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:29,021
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll go to city council and get remanded here again or sent back here again for your actual final approval of the rezoning.

260
00:26:31,162 --> 00:26:39,745
[SPEAKER_09]: But we've gone around quite a few rounds on this to really have the rezoning reflect what we want to do there.

261
00:26:42,504 --> 00:26:43,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you attorney.

262
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:52,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's where we're trying to get to, um, um, without the public and the board having a reference to those iterations, uh, that you and the proponent have done.

263
00:26:53,270 --> 00:27:04,516
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I'm just not, I'm not sure at this point, um, if how to guide the, the meeting going forward, I want to make sure that we're doing right by the city as well as a proponent.

264
00:27:05,036 --> 00:27:09,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so I guess at this time I will request, um, if there are any comments from the city staff.

265
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:17,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda or Danielle, do you want to weigh in?

266
00:27:21,935 --> 00:27:23,416
[SPEAKER_12]: I think so.

267
00:27:23,856 --> 00:27:34,859
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll cede the floor to Danielle if she has anything, but I guess I'll mention that just in alignment with what's already been mentioned by Attorney Orsman and the applicant, we've had

268
00:27:35,957 --> 00:27:42,062
[SPEAKER_12]: of the very iterative process drafting this draft amendment.

269
00:27:42,802 --> 00:27:50,727
[SPEAKER_12]: I think a lot of what was highlighted by the applicant are pieces that were sort of hammered out between us.

270
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:57,292
[SPEAKER_12]: So the linkage language, the cooperation agreement, and making clear that

271
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:17,822
[SPEAKER_12]: that this draft or sorry, that this amendment where other parts of the underlying ordinance don't touch or conflict with what's in the amendment, those things still stand.

272
00:28:17,902 --> 00:28:27,849
[SPEAKER_12]: So those processes or standards may still stand, but where there is conflict is where this amendment triumphs.

273
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:32,192
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's sort of how the overlay operates.

274
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:36,686
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, Danielle, is there anything else you would like to add?

275
00:28:40,068 --> 00:28:48,332
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I just want to echo that this was, um, you know, a very, you know, iterative process.

276
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:53,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these concepts are new to Medford, like the cooperative agreement.

277
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:55,957
[SPEAKER_03]: We definitely, as staff,

278
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:06,239
[SPEAKER_03]: really like the idea of that because you can get all of the details hammered out rather than having a laundry list of conditions to reference.

279
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:16,641
[SPEAKER_03]: It ends up being a lot easier to keep track of conditions and enforce and monitor for compliance while it's being constructed and operating.

280
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:25,883
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and just to remind everyone that the approving, well, this would be,

281
00:29:28,522 --> 00:29:38,966
[SPEAKER_03]: This meeting is to agree on the language, and then if everyone is okay with it, then that is what gets sent to City Council.

282
00:29:39,026 --> 00:29:51,810
[SPEAKER_03]: It immediately comes back, as Attorney Orsman said, and then it'd be approved by City Council, and then there's the whole special permit and site plan re-process, where we get into the minutia of the site plan and design.

283
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:56,272
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's anyone from the public that has questions,

284
00:29:57,383 --> 00:30:22,315
[SPEAKER_03]: very design related or other impacts, those comments will be probably more appropriate or better able to be answered at that time during the actual project is being applied for.

285
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:23,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

286
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:32,799
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pretty much where I know it's a public hearing, but that's what I was trying to guide to stay at a conversation for the public and what we were opening it up for prior to opening it up.

287
00:30:32,819 --> 00:30:37,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for referencing that, Daniel.

288
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:48,352
[SPEAKER_04]: But at this time, I will, I'll ask for clarifying questions to solicit from the board first before opening it up from the public.

289
00:30:48,372 --> 00:30:52,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone from the board have any clarifying questions before we open it up

290
00:30:57,165 --> 00:30:59,106
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't really see my screen.

291
00:31:04,089 --> 00:31:04,750
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Sally.

292
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:11,454
[SPEAKER_17]: The main question that I'm thinking about while going through the presentation was with respect to location.

293
00:31:11,554 --> 00:31:18,959
[SPEAKER_17]: And since the lab is in proximity to residential neighborhoods, will there be any health or safety risks?

294
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,001
[SPEAKER_17]: And if it does, how are these risks mitigated?

295
00:31:31,164 --> 00:31:32,745
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to start with that?

296
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,426
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you go ahead.

297
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for the question.

298
00:31:36,507 --> 00:31:41,069
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Doug Medvech from Verdant.

299
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,491
[SPEAKER_01]: There will not be any health risks.

300
00:31:44,511 --> 00:31:46,072
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be a very contained building.

301
00:31:47,412 --> 00:31:51,815
[SPEAKER_01]: If you noticed all the lab area was going to be contained in the center of the building.

302
00:31:52,695 --> 00:31:57,397
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also a lot of regulations through the building code that will require this building to

303
00:31:58,748 --> 00:32:02,149
[SPEAKER_01]: not allow any of the chemicals outside of the building.

304
00:32:02,989 --> 00:32:06,029
[SPEAKER_01]: Chemical storage is very highly regulated in a building like this.

305
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:17,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that said, the types of science that's gonna be done in this size building and with these early stage companies is gonna be very, very basic, very early stage research.

306
00:32:17,792 --> 00:32:21,232
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount of chemical used in this building will be low.

307
00:32:21,792 --> 00:32:24,273
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of sort of

308
00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:28,135
[SPEAKER_01]: higher level science research will not be done in this building.

309
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:33,058
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be very early stage, very beginning research and development company.

310
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:37,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So there should not be any real concerns around that type of question.

311
00:32:39,575 --> 00:32:52,012
[SPEAKER_08]: In the sort of lab regulation world, we describe that issue of public safety as in terms of biosafety levels, right, BSL.

312
00:32:52,994 --> 00:32:55,177
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a very low level.

313
00:32:56,438 --> 00:32:59,239
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a BSL-2 facility.

314
00:32:59,299 --> 00:33:07,301
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really going to be BSL-1 work that's done here in the vast majority of the instances with maybe some BSL-2.

315
00:33:07,561 --> 00:33:11,382
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're bumping it up to that, but that's really a pretty low level.

316
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:12,582
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Matthew O'Connell.

317
00:33:12,602 --> 00:33:15,103
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with CI Design on the design team.

318
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:19,864
[SPEAKER_00]: To expand on that, BSL-1 is your primary care physician's office.

319
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:22,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so we're starting there, right?

320
00:33:22,605 --> 00:33:36,053
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and both the footprint and the business model for the building, which is generally described as an incubator is bringing in single benchtop research scientists, a couple of scientists, perhaps a group.

321
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:43,139
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal of that group is to find research that is successful and then move to a larger facility.

322
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:47,423
[SPEAKER_00]: So explicitly, there is no manufacturing going on in this building.

323
00:33:48,064 --> 00:33:51,347
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really just primary research at a very small scale.

324
00:33:51,807 --> 00:33:52,908
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's on the way in.

325
00:33:53,829 --> 00:34:01,936
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the way out, we have some very technical requirements that we can test and validate to do with wind, wake, and air entrainment.

326
00:34:02,617 --> 00:34:14,268
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are scientific third-party validated studies and commissioning and qualifications that occur on this building and also continuous monitoring.

327
00:34:15,529 --> 00:34:22,636
[SPEAKER_00]: So any waste going down the drain is intercepted before it ever gets near a public waste system.

328
00:34:24,317 --> 00:34:33,521
[SPEAKER_00]: tested and monitored and likewise any air and treated and any air leaving the building is intercepted and filtered and monitored as well.

329
00:34:34,242 --> 00:34:45,327
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's to the benefit of first the scientists to be selfish, protect the scientists first, but also the building occupants and especially the building neighbors.

330
00:34:46,327 --> 00:34:48,648
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all part of any typical lab building.

331
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:56,969
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's information that would be available to anybody who asked.

332
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the clarification.

333
00:35:06,391 --> 00:35:10,232
[SPEAKER_09]: May I address the board?

334
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:10,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

335
00:35:10,752 --> 00:35:12,512
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to kind of stay on message.

336
00:35:13,442 --> 00:35:18,224
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not, nobody is signing off on this particular development at this meeting.

337
00:35:19,305 --> 00:35:39,255
[SPEAKER_09]: We are talking about the rezoning ordinance and under the rezoning ordinance, they do still have to go for the special permit from city council, which has to make the kind of findings necessary to make sure this is a safe use as well as site plan review where this board will have the same kind of say in it.

338
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,707
[SPEAKER_09]: potentially the cooperation agreement, which will include any kind of mitigation needed to make sure that this is a safe use.

339
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:53,255
[SPEAKER_09]: So all of that will be more fully vetted as the process goes on.

340
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:56,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Attorney Osmond.

341
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:04,696
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my actual questions is the intricacies of the multi-uses and all the different special permits that are needed.

342
00:36:04,897 --> 00:36:10,220
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wasn't exactly sure, again, especially how you detailed the uses.

343
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the applicant has already tried to explain them out.

344
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:16,645
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's just, in layman's terms, it's kind of hard to capture here.

345
00:36:16,725 --> 00:36:18,507
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is going to be played out later.

346
00:36:18,527 --> 00:36:22,449
[SPEAKER_04]: At this point, what the board is trying to do is just

347
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:25,830
[SPEAKER_04]: to recommend it to the city council to continue this.

348
00:36:26,331 --> 00:36:27,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that correct?

349
00:36:27,131 --> 00:36:30,231
[SPEAKER_04]: So that it can be vetted out.

350
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:30,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

351
00:36:31,432 --> 00:36:31,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

352
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,652
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, on the uses, just to explain what happened.

353
00:36:37,553 --> 00:36:44,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Most times you have a planned development district or PUD or something, the desired use is by right.

354
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:50,255
[SPEAKER_09]: And technically that's the case here, the way it's drafted.

355
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:57,212
[SPEAKER_09]: because under the current zoning, you'd have to go to the board of appeals to get this use permitted by a special permit.

356
00:36:57,272 --> 00:37:02,514
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, you know, if you did it in the PDD, you'd have to go to the city council as well and get the PDD special permit.

357
00:37:03,094 --> 00:37:11,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've kind of collapsed all of the primary use here into the city council's special permit and the site plan review process.

358
00:37:12,377 --> 00:37:15,779
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the other uses we kept around seem unlikely.

359
00:37:17,598 --> 00:37:19,979
[SPEAKER_09]: And it would probably just be small accessory.

360
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:24,040
[SPEAKER_09]: And those would still require an actual special permit separate from the process.

361
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:38,823
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there were a lot of uses in the underlying zoning district, things like automotive repair or what have you, that, you know, if this rezoning gets adopted, those aren't going to apply because you don't want those types of uses at this kind of scale.

362
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:40,743
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're just, they're not relevant, right?

363
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:42,964
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's what we did with the uses.

364
00:37:43,904 --> 00:37:47,085
[SPEAKER_09]: The life science, it's basically allowed by rights subject

365
00:37:47,548 --> 00:37:51,573
[SPEAKER_09]: to the city council special permit required by the bylaw or ordinance.

366
00:37:52,234 --> 00:37:56,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Some other uses are allowed by special permit and then a bunch of uses have been disallowed.

367
00:37:56,379 --> 00:37:57,300
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where we are.

368
00:37:59,222 --> 00:37:59,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

369
00:37:59,563 --> 00:38:06,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize if I've taken up the time from other board members that have any questions.

370
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:13,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Hearing none, I'm going to open up the public comment period.

371
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature or message Amanda in the comments.

372
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:23,796
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

373
00:38:24,036 --> 00:38:27,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

374
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:33,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

375
00:38:35,013 --> 00:38:35,574
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

376
00:38:35,654 --> 00:38:41,080
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just put in the chat some instructions for how to connect with us.

377
00:38:42,982 --> 00:38:51,953
[SPEAKER_12]: We did not receive any comments ahead of the meeting, but let me quickly check to just make sure that none have come in since then.

378
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:00,727
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, seeing none at this time.

379
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:06,952
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm just going to review our participants list just to make sure there are no raised hands.

380
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,293
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not seeing any.

381
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:14,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, seeing no raised hands and nothing in the chat.

382
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:16,620
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think no comment at this time.

383
00:39:20,724 --> 00:39:21,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

384
00:39:22,405 --> 00:39:25,508
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this point, I will close the public comment period.

385
00:39:26,328 --> 00:39:26,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will

386
00:39:27,914 --> 00:39:29,415
[SPEAKER_04]: bring it back to board deliberation.

387
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:51,830
[SPEAKER_02]: And one last chance for the board to ask any questions of the applicant or of attorney or of the city staff or to even discuss whether or not you have enough information on what to recommend.

388
00:40:02,332 --> 00:40:17,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, at this point, um, hearing, uh, no further, um, responses from the board, I will ask for a motion to recommend the, um, the language as is, uh, going to the city council as opposed to continue it or anything like that.

389
00:40:17,979 --> 00:40:27,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause that's, uh, attorney Orzman has said, this has had many iterations with the city, with, uh, the applicants attorney, as well as, um, attorney Orzman as the city staff.

390
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:32,065
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we'll let it go to its next step with the city council and, um,

391
00:40:32,538 --> 00:40:36,562
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will ask for a motion to recommend to the city council.

392
00:40:39,585 --> 00:40:39,985
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion.

393
00:40:42,668 --> 00:40:43,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I get a second?

394
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:45,590
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll second.

395
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:50,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I will do a roll call.

396
00:40:55,299 --> 00:40:55,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

397
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:02,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Ari Fishman.

398
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:04,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

399
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Pam Mariansky.

400
00:41:07,322 --> 00:41:07,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

401
00:41:08,723 --> 00:41:09,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Sally Akiki.

402
00:41:10,405 --> 00:41:10,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

403
00:41:11,406 --> 00:41:12,927
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

404
00:41:17,071 --> 00:41:17,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it?

405
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:18,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

406
00:41:19,693 --> 00:41:20,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

407
00:41:22,095 --> 00:41:23,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't get everyone's name.

408
00:41:23,116 --> 00:41:25,098
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know attorney Heffernan.

409
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,764
[SPEAKER_04]: And I apologize, I didn't get everyone else's name.

410
00:41:28,804 --> 00:41:35,228
[SPEAKER_04]: I see that everyone's on one screen, but thank you for your presentation and we will see you when you come back.

411
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:36,810
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

412
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

413
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:38,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:39,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a great evening.

00:41:39,832 --> 00:41:42,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you and good night.

416
00:41:42,914 --> 00:41:44,375
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you, Attorney Wasman.

417
00:41:45,656 --> 00:41:46,156
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome.

418
00:41:46,476 --> 00:41:48,477
All right.

419
00:41:48,838 --> 00:41:49,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Good night.

420
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:52,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

00:41:53,521 --> 00:41:54,702
[SPEAKER_02]: So the next item,

[SPEAKER_04]: We have the pleasure of site plan review for 285 to 295 Middlesex Ave, H Mart.

423
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:20,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda, am I not mistaken if this is a request for motion for continuance based on a quorum issue?

424
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,251
[SPEAKER_04]: That is correct, yes.

425
00:42:27,196 --> 00:42:32,598
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the applicant in attendance or have they been informed prior to?

426
00:42:33,278 --> 00:42:35,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, they've been in or sorry, they're not in attendance.

427
00:42:35,979 --> 00:42:43,201
[SPEAKER_12]: They were informed by our office prior to and so they would like to request a continuance tonight as well.

428
00:42:43,982 --> 00:42:50,544
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so is it to a date certain or just being tabled to the next meeting?

429
00:42:51,169 --> 00:43:04,013
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be to a date certain, um, and the applicant has confirmed with me that, um, the 16th, uh, which is the next scheduled CD board hearing or meeting date, um, is amenable to them.

430
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,594
[SPEAKER_04]: August 16th.

431
00:43:06,854 --> 00:43:12,916
[SPEAKER_04]: And does that need a roll call vote or does that need a vote from the board or can we just, since they're not in attendance?

432
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Danielle, you need to just, you can vote to continue it.

433
00:43:18,417 --> 00:43:20,918
[SPEAKER_03]: The applicant doesn't have to be here to continue it.

434
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:22,220
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

435
00:43:23,501 --> 00:43:33,348
[SPEAKER_04]: May I please ask a motion from the board to continue the site plan review for 285 to 295 Middlesex Avenue to August 16th, 2023?

436
00:43:33,388 --> 00:43:35,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it the 16th or the 19th?

00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,370
[SPEAKER_04]: 16th.

00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,110
[SPEAKER_04]: I so move.

00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:36,511
[SPEAKER_04]: A second?

441
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:36,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: And myself, Jackie, I'm yes.

[SPEAKER_04]: Our next item is 100 Winchester Street Plan Development District.

451
00:44:15,271 --> 00:44:16,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I will read the public notice.

452
00:44:20,398 --> 00:44:24,662
[SPEAKER_12]: second.

453
00:44:24,702 --> 00:44:25,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam chair.

454
00:44:25,822 --> 00:44:28,705
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess, um, for the public notice.

455
00:44:28,945 --> 00:44:35,610
[SPEAKER_12]: We advertised this hearing jointly with the hearing, um, down the line for with City Council.

456
00:44:36,111 --> 00:44:38,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Um so and I forgot to point that point that out.

457
00:44:38,532 --> 00:44:38,993
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

458
00:44:39,253 --> 00:44:42,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Um and so we can just focus on the I think it's the first

459
00:44:50,124 --> 00:44:53,608
[SPEAKER_04]: So just as any other regular city board public hearing notice, okay.

460
00:44:54,068 --> 00:44:59,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on August 2, 2023 after 6.30 p.m.

461
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:12,706
[SPEAKER_04]: via Zoom relative to a petition by 96-202 Winchester Street LLC to amend zoning map City of Medford Mass dated April 13, 1965 as referenced in Medford Zoning Ordinance Chapter 94-2.2.

462
00:45:14,648 --> 00:45:26,833
[SPEAKER_04]: The amendment proposes to change the zoning district designation of the properties 96-102 Winchester Street and 104 Winchester Street from General Residential, GR, to Zoning District and Commercial 1, C1.

463
00:45:27,534 --> 00:45:40,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Zoning district to a planned development district, PDD, which would have new development standards as depicted on the plan entitled Area Plan at 100 Winchester Street, dated December 7th, 2022 from Medford Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, 9.2.3.

464
00:45:43,713 --> 00:45:56,280
[SPEAKER_04]: A link to the public hearing is to be posted on the city's website at www.medford.ma.org, no later than July 18th, 2023, in which it has been posted already.

465
00:45:58,961 --> 00:46:01,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I believe I've satisfied that obligatory.

466
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:08,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Please correct me if I'm mistaken, Amanda.

467
00:46:08,126 --> 00:46:08,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

468
00:46:11,675 --> 00:46:16,537
[SPEAKER_04]: So attorney Jonathan Silverstein of BBHS law is available as support and counsel for the board.

469
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:19,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, he will assist the board and draft an amendment and make a revision.

470
00:46:20,619 --> 00:46:22,480
[SPEAKER_04]: Members should feel free to ask questions.

471
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, uh, welcome attorney Silverstein.

472
00:46:26,601 --> 00:46:27,502
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for being here.

473
00:46:28,342 --> 00:46:34,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, at this time, we're going to invite the applicant, uh, for 100 Winchester street to introduce themselves and present their proposal.

474
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam Chair and members of the board.

475
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:42,093
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Adam Barnosky, 255 State Street in Gloucester.

476
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:47,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm an attorney for 96-102 Winchester Street LLC, the property owner and the proposed developer.

477
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:56,808
[SPEAKER_05]: With me are the developers, Steve and Gerald Nardone, Peter Quinn, the project architect, my co-counsel Michael Barone, as well as several members of our development team.

478
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:03,903
[SPEAKER_05]: We are here relative to the new plan development district pursuant to 9.2 of the zoning ordinance.

479
00:47:04,664 --> 00:47:06,405
[SPEAKER_05]: We're very excited about this proposal.

480
00:47:06,465 --> 00:47:07,967
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a long time in the development.

481
00:47:08,407 --> 00:47:12,931
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd again like to thank the planning department staff, legal counsel for their efforts throughout this process.

482
00:47:13,451 --> 00:47:21,238
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that the PDD process remains new for the city and we do appreciate the joint undertaking by all parties involved here.

483
00:47:22,099 --> 00:47:25,021
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to provide the board with an overview of the property and the proposal.

484
00:47:29,442 --> 00:47:33,063
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to limit my initial presentation to the zoning components of this application.

485
00:47:33,543 --> 00:47:37,104
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do have the ability to discuss any components of the underlying project.

486
00:47:37,545 --> 00:47:41,606
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned, we do have the entire design team here to answer any questions the board may have.

487
00:47:42,466 --> 00:47:48,428
[SPEAKER_05]: So first about the property, the proposed PDD site is located on the southern portion of Winchester Street.

488
00:47:52,021 --> 00:47:55,103
[SPEAKER_05]: consists of three lots measuring just under 50,000 square feet.

489
00:47:55,964 --> 00:48:02,349
[SPEAKER_05]: The two lots located at 96-102 Winchester are contiguous through lots with frontage on Winchester and Alfred Street.

490
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:08,753
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been used for many years for different uses, commercial space for offices, garaging, and outdoor vehicle storage.

491
00:48:09,434 --> 00:48:15,418
[SPEAKER_05]: The lot located at 104 Winchester Street is a corner lot with frontage on Winchester and Albion.

492
00:48:15,618 --> 00:48:21,723
[SPEAKER_05]: It's improved with a two-story residence that's been deemed preferably preserved by the Medford Historical Commission.

493
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:29,540
[SPEAKER_05]: our zoning district with a small portion in the C1.

494
00:48:30,401 --> 00:48:32,384
[SPEAKER_05]: The properties are currently owned by 96-102 Winchester Street.

495
00:48:34,693 --> 00:48:42,737
[SPEAKER_05]: The team thought this property would be a good and appropriate location for a PDD because of its size and its current use within the zoning district.

496
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:54,623
[SPEAKER_05]: It lends itself to a use that's more consistent with the residential nature of the neighborhood and in relation to the multifamily projects developed in recent years in the surrounding area.

497
00:48:55,864 --> 00:49:03,328
[SPEAKER_05]: It's also worth noting that the PDD was developed with specific uses and structures in mind as such that those zoning is specific to

498
00:49:09,227 --> 00:49:18,813
[SPEAKER_05]: in the process here as the board is aware that in the event this PDD is approved by this board, it will then go to the city council for for full approval.

499
00:49:19,233 --> 00:49:25,937
[SPEAKER_05]: And after that, we will present to this board and city council again the underlying project.

500
00:49:26,317 --> 00:49:35,344
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll have to go through the site plan review process, as well as a special permit with the community, I'm sorry, with the city council being the special permit granting authority.

501
00:49:36,285 --> 00:49:49,635
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a long way of saying that we've been before this board a few times on this proposal, we've met with the community a few times on this proposal, and in a way, we're just getting started.

502
00:49:49,675 --> 00:49:53,979
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think there's gonna be a lot of familiarity here with our team and the project.

503
00:49:55,038 --> 00:50:05,528
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have a draft of the, so tonight's hearing again relates only to the approval of the PDD zoning district under section 9.2, and we're not here regarding any specific project.

504
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:13,395
[SPEAKER_05]: You do have a draft zoning amendment before you, which is listed as section 94-9.285 of the zoning ordinance.

505
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:17,760
[SPEAKER_05]: It details the proposed use and dimensional requirements under the overlay.

506
00:50:18,812 --> 00:50:25,760
[SPEAKER_05]: You might recall the the uses were subject to our original discussion before this board and our original use.

507
00:50:28,857 --> 00:50:29,077
[SPEAKER_05]: forward.

508
00:50:29,697 --> 00:50:38,299
[SPEAKER_05]: And we took a lot of time to tailor the use table that's before you to be more in line with the intended uses for the property.

509
00:50:38,399 --> 00:50:47,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Originally, we cast a wide net and just said that any uses that were allowed by right under the underlying zoning districts, either the GR or the C would be allowed here.

510
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:57,422
[SPEAKER_05]: But after some more consideration, we thought, let's just tailor this really to make sense with the project that the developers hope to present before you down the road.

511
00:50:59,674 --> 00:51:22,803
[SPEAKER_05]: So the dimensional elements here are intended to blend the underlying district's requirements with certain modifications to accommodate scale without a significant disruption to the neighborhood, and to allow room to modify if needed when this underlying project goes before a more comprehensive Community Development Board review and City Council review during the special permitting process.

512
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:37,187
[SPEAKER_05]: As it's currently drafted, the PDD zoning has proposed heights in line with recent developments in the area and along Broadway, setbacks similar to existing conditions at neighboring properties, and below grade parking in excess of the underlying requirements.

513
00:51:37,807 --> 00:51:41,168
[SPEAKER_05]: There are reasonable open space and lot coverage requirements for the area.

514
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:59,120
[SPEAKER_05]: In a broader context, just talking about the city zoning and kind of what a PDD is or maybe should be, this is intended to create a gradual transition between the C1 zoning district along Broadway into the general residential zoning district of the subject neighborhood.

515
00:51:59,681 --> 00:52:05,044
[SPEAKER_05]: As I mentioned, while the property is located primarily in the GR, it abuts and is partially located in the C1.

516
00:52:06,497 --> 00:52:15,739
[SPEAKER_05]: So the commercial district along Broadway is becoming typified by mixed use development, multifamily development and a continuation of commercial uses.

517
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:25,282
[SPEAKER_05]: So this site and the PDD fit within the broader transitioning of this area and of the city particularly in relation to the district's proximity to the GLX and Ball Square T stations.

518
00:52:26,485 --> 00:52:30,267
[SPEAKER_05]: The proposed use tables and dimensional tables are relatively straightforward.

519
00:52:31,048 --> 00:52:38,152
[SPEAKER_05]: They've been succinctly stated, they've been crafted and drafted along with reviews and edits by the city's legal counsel.

520
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:51,340
[SPEAKER_05]: We are happy to walk through any elements there, although I feel like they, for the most part, speak for themselves, but we're happy to walk through any elements of zoning, the map that's been proposed, or the underlying project that the board so requests.

521
00:53:00,752 --> 00:53:02,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Attorney Baranowski.

522
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:13,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Attorney Silverman, I'm not sure if you wanted to add any comments prior to the sitting.

523
00:53:20,646 --> 00:53:25,790
[SPEAKER_14]: No, Madam Chair, other than to just note that

524
00:53:27,352 --> 00:53:37,394
[SPEAKER_14]: As you'll see, and as has been noted, there have been a couple minor changes to this ordinance since the last time you saw it, really just clarification amendments.

525
00:53:38,075 --> 00:53:53,198
[SPEAKER_14]: And from our perspective, as with the last one, this has been an ordinance that has gone through a number of changes, been very cooperative, and I think it's ready

526
00:53:56,338 --> 00:53:58,500
[SPEAKER_14]: to answer any questions you may have.

527
00:54:01,102 --> 00:54:02,363
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Attorney Silverstein.

528
00:54:03,945 --> 00:54:05,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there any comments from the city staff?

529
00:54:07,027 --> 00:54:09,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda or Danielle, is there anything you want to add?

530
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:18,337
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may, I might just add that we obviously just saw another PDD application.

531
00:54:18,678 --> 00:54:22,141
[SPEAKER_12]: This application is a couple of steps down the line.

532
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:34,567
[SPEAKER_12]: and, you know, this was described already, but in summary, at this stage, the board is responsible for reviewing the amendment as it's been drafted.

533
00:54:34,687 --> 00:54:41,432
[SPEAKER_12]: And this should be, you know, before we move it to city council, it should be tidied up.

534
00:54:41,552 --> 00:54:50,118
[SPEAKER_12]: If there are any kind of any pieces that, you know, the board has questions on or wants to make additions to, et cetera.

535
00:54:50,558 --> 00:54:52,960
[SPEAKER_12]: And then whatever is approved here

536
00:54:53,494 --> 00:54:54,314
[SPEAKER_12]: would be approved.

537
00:54:54,334 --> 00:54:58,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Um if approved, um, would be, you know, recommended to City Council.

538
00:54:58,736 --> 00:55:03,857
[SPEAKER_12]: And then at that point, they have their own deliberations and, you know, vote to on whether to adopt.

539
00:55:06,078 --> 00:55:06,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for that.

540
00:55:07,438 --> 00:55:10,159
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the clarifying questions that I actually have Amanda.

541
00:55:10,259 --> 00:55:16,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if you're or turning Silverstein is in the board's position on

542
00:55:23,588 --> 00:55:29,329
[SPEAKER_04]: further department review or, um, or comments from the attorney or anything like that.

543
00:55:29,389 --> 00:55:41,531
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure what it is outside of, if you've said this has been in, um, you know, an iterative process where, um, the board has come to agreement with the attorneys as well as the city.

544
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:43,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

545
00:55:43,151 --> 00:55:45,952
[SPEAKER_04]: What would the board be pulling out of this at this point?

546
00:55:46,192 --> 00:55:52,713
[SPEAKER_04]: If there was any kind of, um, any kind of concerns, because again, this is not site plan review.

547
00:55:52,773 --> 00:55:52,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

548
00:55:54,098 --> 00:55:57,400
[SPEAKER_04]: What will we if is it out of whack with the zoning?

549
00:55:59,001 --> 00:56:00,782
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it that we're looking at?

550
00:56:02,724 --> 00:56:04,345
[SPEAKER_12]: I can take a stab at answering that.

551
00:56:04,445 --> 00:56:09,828
[SPEAKER_12]: And Danielle or Jonathan, please feel free to either step in or correct me if I'm off base.

552
00:56:09,888 --> 00:56:17,393
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that our office feels pretty comfortable with what or very comfortable with what's been submitted to the board.

553
00:56:18,863 --> 00:56:23,568
[SPEAKER_12]: As was the case with the previous application, this was a very collaborative experience.

554
00:56:24,569 --> 00:56:32,758
[SPEAKER_12]: The draft went through several revisions with our office, Attorney Silverstein, and with the applicant.

555
00:56:33,656 --> 00:56:37,339
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this is sort of what's emerged out of those conversations.

556
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,786
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that, you know, our office advises the board.

557
00:56:44,747 --> 00:56:49,412
[SPEAKER_12]: But of course, at the end of the day, the board is its own entity and authority.

558
00:56:49,592 --> 00:56:51,434
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if you all, you know,

559
00:56:51,874 --> 00:57:05,386
[SPEAKER_12]: in reviewing found things where you were like, hmm, I don't know why this is here, or, oh, I don't love what's proposed for the dimensionals here, or these uses maybe I have concerns about.

560
00:57:06,107 --> 00:57:10,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are things that you would all discuss tonight.

561
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:15,855
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I may, to the chair, I'd also add that

562
00:57:17,656 --> 00:57:44,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So while there might not be like particular findings that are before you, when, you know, staff was considering this, this development has been kind of like in the conversation, I think since before the zoning was even passed, I know that it went to, it was before the historical commission couple of years ago, maybe, or I can't keep track of time anymore, but it feels like a long time.

563
00:57:46,433 --> 00:57:46,794
[SPEAKER_03]: And so,

564
00:57:48,097 --> 00:58:01,400
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we went through a comprehensive planning process and it's very apparent that our zoning districts and allowed uses dimensional standards are misaligned with the goals and vision that came out of the comprehensive planning process.

565
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:12,042
[SPEAKER_03]: But the neck before we can, you know, get what we want by updating the zoning, you know, like quarter by square by, you know,

566
00:58:13,672 --> 00:58:19,436
[SPEAKER_03]: all around and across the city, we'd have to having more like individual studies and that's not like an instantaneous thing.

567
00:58:19,917 --> 00:58:39,492
[SPEAKER_03]: So the planned development district is a tool that we can use when we find a use that aligns or a development that aligns with our comprehensive plan based on the use, the scale, the building types, the location, then

568
00:58:40,863 --> 00:58:52,431
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a tool where we can make that project work now without variances or just having to say, okay, come back in five years when it's allowed.

569
00:58:52,971 --> 00:59:03,638
[SPEAKER_03]: When in the present, we could start having some of the higher and better uses that we would have to wait for otherwise until we update the zoning for the entire city.

570
00:59:05,910 --> 00:59:07,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Daniel, for explaining that.

571
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:16,252
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just brings me back to the kind of things that I want to kind of look at here are not part of zoning.

572
00:59:16,272 --> 00:59:21,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's why I have to keep asking clarifying questions to make sure that I'm keeping myself on tap.

573
00:59:22,113 --> 00:59:31,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Because at this point, it's like, it looks like it's well prepared with legal as well as with the city is to move forward recommended, but I'm just one board member.

574
00:59:32,315 --> 00:59:34,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And so at this point, it's like, it's just,

575
00:59:36,252 --> 00:59:40,973
[SPEAKER_04]: the things that I want to talk about are not, they're not, we're not there yet.

576
00:59:41,113 --> 00:59:47,095
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanted to make sure that we were focusing on the right items going before.

577
00:59:47,795 --> 00:59:52,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And saying that, I will ask if there's any other clarifying questions from the board.

578
00:59:52,456 --> 00:59:56,257
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I have one if I may.

579
00:59:56,277 --> 00:59:57,437
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, Sally.

580
00:59:58,057 --> 00:59:58,277
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

581
00:59:58,577 --> 01:00:05,339
[SPEAKER_17]: So reading through the PDD zoning amendment word document, there's within the minimum parking,

582
01:00:06,388 --> 01:00:08,832
[SPEAKER_17]: It says no required parking for commercial.

583
01:00:08,912 --> 01:00:10,696
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not really familiar with the streets.

584
01:00:10,916 --> 01:00:12,499
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there street parking there?

585
01:00:12,679 --> 01:00:19,051
[SPEAKER_17]: And will we put the strain on the street parking, especially that it's a residential, partially a residential area?

586
01:00:44,052 --> 01:00:44,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask a question?

587
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:52,554
[SPEAKER_03]: What would be the requirement under the current zoning for a commercial use there?

588
01:00:52,574 --> 01:00:57,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know that it's in proximity to transit, which has a bunch of reduced standards.

589
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:12,718
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that, I believe that the parking for at least the residential uses is compliant under the current zoning regulations, but I don't know if I've done the comparison for

590
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:16,016
[SPEAKER_03]: the commercial.

591
01:01:20,318 --> 01:01:22,659
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, this is Michael Brown for the applicant.

592
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:29,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I am just pulling up the parking requirements in our dimensional table.

593
01:01:32,944 --> 01:01:40,667
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like we've addressed the residential and the materials, but I do have the code immediately handy, so I will pull that up now.

594
01:01:45,557 --> 01:01:54,164
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe based upon our location, because it is within the half mile, quarter mile, I believe we are exempt, but I do just want to double check that.

595
01:02:06,994 --> 01:02:11,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Mike can confirm, but I do believe that there was an exemption for commercial and

596
01:02:19,757 --> 01:02:22,258
[SPEAKER_18]: So is there a street parking available in this area?

597
01:02:22,378 --> 01:02:29,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Again, sorry, I'm not familiar with the streets.

598
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:33,342
[SPEAKER_07]: There is, to some extent, parking available on the street.

599
01:02:33,562 --> 01:02:39,424
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just trying to pull up the... Unfortunately, the files are slowing me down a bit.

600
01:02:40,305 --> 01:02:48,268
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe we do have anticipated some drop-off in parking areas along Albion Street, but we don't expect significant

601
01:02:50,442 --> 01:02:57,608
[SPEAKER_07]: car parking traffic to occur at the commercial use on the corner that's presently 104 Winchester.

602
01:02:57,628 --> 01:03:09,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I did find the provision that non-resident uses with 5,000 square feet or less of gross leaseable floor area are exempt from the minimum parking.

603
01:03:09,858 --> 01:03:11,320
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did find that.

604
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:15,343
[SPEAKER_03]: I should have just turned the page to see that the asterisk there.

605
01:03:15,903 --> 01:03:16,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, under 6.1.3.

606
01:03:18,898 --> 01:03:36,056
[SPEAKER_05]: And if I if I may just just briefly I, you know, without trying to get into specifics of the underlying project it is it is anticipated that whatever the commercial uses, as identified, you know, by writer special permit and the use table we do anticipate that that's going to be ancillary.

607
01:03:36,076 --> 01:03:40,160
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really going to be ancillary to a residential development.

608
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:46,902
[SPEAKER_05]: be more an accommodation or an accessory for the direct neighborhood.

609
01:03:47,262 --> 01:03:57,905
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of a longer way of just saying we don't anticipate that this is going to be a commercial use that drives traffic inward but rather is an amenity for existing residents.

610
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:16,674
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you for the clarification.

611
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:20,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

612
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:28,844
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are no other board comments, I want to open it up for public comment.

613
01:04:29,464 --> 01:04:32,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature.

614
01:04:33,115 --> 01:04:34,315
[SPEAKER_04]: message Amanda in the comments.

615
01:04:34,695 --> 01:04:39,637
[SPEAKER_04]: You can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

616
01:04:40,117 --> 01:04:43,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

617
01:04:43,658 --> 01:04:49,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda, can you please manage the public comment queue and read any previously sent emails or letters?

618
01:04:49,279 --> 01:04:51,259
[SPEAKER_12]: It would be my pleasure.

619
01:04:51,279 --> 01:04:51,840
[SPEAKER_12]: So I

620
01:04:54,352 --> 01:04:59,034
[SPEAKER_12]: don't believe we've received any comments prior to the meeting.

621
01:04:59,214 --> 01:05:03,475
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just going to check the email now just to make sure nothing new has come in.

622
01:05:05,196 --> 01:05:13,839
[SPEAKER_12]: And as our chair stated, if there's anyone from the public who would like to provide comment, you can raise your hand.

623
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:20,901
[SPEAKER_12]: You can message in the chat and or wave on your screen if you're not sure how to do those things.

624
01:05:21,621 --> 01:05:22,722
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll just take a look through.

625
01:05:22,742 --> 01:05:23,542
[SPEAKER_12]: I see.

626
01:05:23,562 --> 01:05:23,842
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

627
01:05:24,403 --> 01:05:26,024
[SPEAKER_12]: I see Jack's iPhone.

628
01:05:27,145 --> 01:05:29,487
[SPEAKER_12]: Your hand is raised, so I'm going to unmute you.

629
01:05:29,527 --> 01:05:33,890
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you could just state your name and address for the record before providing your comment.

630
01:05:37,933 --> 01:05:39,094
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, thank you, Amanda.

631
01:05:39,274 --> 01:05:41,276
[SPEAKER_11]: It's John Carroll from 35 Clayton Avenue.

632
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:48,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Like to first of all, thank you for your detailed response to my barrage of questions.

633
01:05:49,964 --> 01:05:52,405
[SPEAKER_11]: After the last meeting, I appreciate that.

634
01:05:53,305 --> 01:06:04,972
[SPEAKER_11]: I just want to clarify what I just heard around the traffic and where the commercial area isn't they don't anticipate it's going to be an issue.

635
01:06:05,592 --> 01:06:12,516
[SPEAKER_11]: Does this have anything to do with the traffic impact study in the waiver that's been requested?

636
01:06:15,473 --> 01:06:16,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Am I correct?

637
01:06:16,133 --> 01:06:28,157
[SPEAKER_11]: And I thought I read that there was a waiver requested for not conducting a traffic impact study, or if that's what you call it, a traffic study for process.

638
01:06:31,818 --> 01:06:32,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Through the chair?

639
01:06:33,759 --> 01:06:36,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, please, Amanda.

640
01:06:36,219 --> 01:06:37,340
[SPEAKER_12]: So I believe

641
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:56,532
[SPEAKER_12]: When we get a little bit further into this PDD process, so past the zoning phase and into actually discourse about the PD special permit and the site plan review is where we would expect to see a traffic study, for example.

642
01:06:56,672 --> 01:07:02,318
[SPEAKER_12]: So at this stage, we don't have that as part of the application.

643
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:09,344
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so did I, I'm sorry, did I misunderstand the conversation then what these gentlemen were just speaking about?

644
01:07:10,025 --> 01:07:17,346
[SPEAKER_11]: That has nothing to do with a traffic impact study or around, you know, that whole issue.

645
01:07:17,366 --> 01:07:18,427
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct?

646
01:07:19,687 --> 01:07:24,448
[SPEAKER_11]: What they were just referring to and in terms of not the commercial use and all of that.

647
01:07:25,788 --> 01:07:26,588
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes and no.

648
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:32,771
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this stage, we're doing the actual zoning and that's what we're focusing on.

649
01:07:32,831 --> 01:07:44,237
[SPEAKER_04]: But should this get recommended and moved on, then the community development board has the onus of making sure that the site, we would review that at the site plan review.

650
01:07:44,937 --> 01:07:52,161
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, but there's not a prior exemption because it's not anticipated to have a certain number of commercial impact.

651
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:56,444
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that correct?

652
01:07:57,144 --> 01:08:09,108
[SPEAKER_11]: There's not an automatic exemption from that happening because they don't anticipate a high impact commercial usage.

653
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:24,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Attorney Silverstein, are you able to help us out with the language here as far as how 17 on the dimensional standards and requirements would

654
01:08:26,647 --> 01:08:27,368
[SPEAKER_04]: play out later?

655
01:08:27,388 --> 01:08:42,934
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize if I'm not being clear, but I'm kind of new to this process as well.

656
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:47,936
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think I'm hearing two different things, but I'm not sure.

657
01:08:49,106 --> 01:08:54,771
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you're absolutely within rights and you have every right to have this question clarified.

658
01:08:54,811 --> 01:09:06,842
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I was trying to get the attorney available to us to do is to better explain what it meant as captured here versus what we would be doing in the site plan review.

659
01:09:08,653 --> 01:09:09,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam Chair, if I may.

660
01:09:10,174 --> 01:09:11,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.

661
01:09:11,174 --> 01:09:12,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael Barone again for the applicant.

662
01:09:13,495 --> 01:09:27,580
[SPEAKER_07]: As part of our initial preliminary submission for the PDD application we did submit a transportation impact and access study that's identified as item nine exhibit G in the folder available materials.

663
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:38,424
[SPEAKER_07]: But the issue for clarification purposes, the issue we were just discussing a little earlier dealt with the zoning codes required off street parking for commercial uses.

664
01:09:39,145 --> 01:09:47,028
[SPEAKER_07]: So two slightly different yet related items, but we do have a transportation impact and access study available for review.

665
01:09:47,868 --> 01:09:48,168
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

666
01:09:48,208 --> 01:09:49,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much for the clarification.

667
01:09:49,969 --> 01:09:50,649
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate it.

668
01:09:52,910 --> 01:09:53,350
[SPEAKER_11]: Very well.

669
01:09:54,251 --> 01:09:54,591
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

670
01:10:00,957 --> 01:10:13,226
[SPEAKER_11]: So because this is strictly for zoning, I won't put the car before the horse and get into a lot of concerns that would come up, I guess, in phase three of the process.

671
01:10:13,266 --> 01:10:14,948
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think I'm good right now.

672
01:10:16,709 --> 01:10:18,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much for your question.

673
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:42,704
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm just taking a look to see if anyone else is raising their hand or has an interest in speaking to provide public comment.

674
01:10:49,767 --> 01:10:55,530
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't believe I see anyone, and I don't believe anyone has emailed.

675
01:10:56,250 --> 01:10:58,391
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think no additional comment at this time.

676
01:11:01,762 --> 01:11:02,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Amanda.

677
01:11:02,682 --> 01:11:13,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to close the public comment period at this time and ask the board for any final clarification questions prior to deliberation.

678
01:11:18,465 --> 01:11:30,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the board want to delve into anything else regarding adjustments to the proposed use table, dimensional table outside of what has already been raised with parking?

679
01:11:40,594 --> 01:12:00,570
[SPEAKER_04]: hearing no further comments or questions from the board, and based on the information that I have from the city as well as from both attorneys, I'm going to ask for a potential motion to recommend approval of the drafted PDD rezoning ordinance for 100 Winchester Street PDD to city council.

680
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:03,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Does anyone want to give a motion?

681
01:12:07,436 --> 01:12:08,056
[SPEAKER_16]: I so move.

682
01:12:09,217 --> 01:12:09,517

[SPEAKER_12]: I apologize.

01:13:07,087 --> 01:13:12,348

[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I did hear two people second.

704
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:20,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard, I think I heard two people at once.

705
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:21,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

706
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:27,551

714
01:14:19,453 --> 01:14:25,495
[SPEAKER_04]: The petition, the petition proposes corrections and clarifications for technical discrepancies.

715
01:14:25,575 --> 01:14:34,598
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to one amending the table of use and parking regulations for each motor vehicle related uses and I miscellaneous commercial uses.

718
01:14:50,726 --> 01:14:51,326
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

719
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:57,188
[SPEAKER_04]: A link to the public hearing is to be posted on the city's website and it was posted related in July 18th.

720
01:15:02,563 --> 01:15:06,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda, do you want to take it from here?

721
01:15:06,046 --> 01:15:10,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure thing.

722
01:15:10,188 --> 01:15:17,814
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to actually, excuse me, cede the floor to Danielle Evans, Senior Planner, to present.

723
01:15:20,176 --> 01:15:20,796
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.

724
01:15:25,514 --> 01:15:34,160
[SPEAKER_03]: As you all know, and I think at least, I think only one of you, Jackie, I think you're the only one on the board that went through the recodification process.

725
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:44,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was the long zoning recodification that was passed in March, 2022.

726
01:15:44,227 --> 01:15:47,909
[SPEAKER_03]: It was sort of a cleanup, take out some unlawful provisions,

727
01:15:53,606 --> 01:15:59,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, modernize it, add provisions that should be in there that aren't, um, but it didn't.

728
01:15:59,810 --> 01:16:01,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Make too many major things.

729
01:16:01,471 --> 01:16:14,358
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is some low hanging fruit, like, um, the provisions for planned development districts, like as I was mentioning before, uh, you know, we are recognizing that our zoning doesn't match our visions and, you know, here's a quick fix because the next.

730
01:16:15,339 --> 01:16:18,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, set of zoning changes will be, you know, sometime coming.

731
01:16:19,461 --> 01:16:21,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, in addition, there were.

732
01:16:22,754 --> 01:16:34,853
[SPEAKER_03]: provisions for accessory dwelling units, you know, short term rentals, just putting things in there that were, you know, as I was saying, like the low hanging fruit, but not the big stuff.

733
01:16:35,394 --> 01:16:36,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately,

734
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:43,224
[SPEAKER_03]: It was such a complicated process that I wasn't part of the rewriting.

735
01:16:43,244 --> 01:16:48,688
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wasn't in all the meetings, but, you know, you change one thing and it had like a ripple effect.

736
01:16:48,708 --> 01:16:51,630
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some unintended consequences that create some conflicts.

737
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:59,876
[SPEAKER_03]: So it makes it hard to, you know, implement the zoning and administer the zoning.

738
01:17:00,516 --> 01:17:06,781
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, there's some conflicts and confusion around referrals.

739
01:17:08,256 --> 01:17:24,806
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, there's different levels of special permits that have never, you know, needed a recommendation before the permitting, the special permit granting authority could vote on it, but there's language in there that says all special permits.

740
01:17:26,487 --> 01:17:36,553
[SPEAKER_03]: So special permits for non-conforming like structures where you're just, you know, altering structure, which is, you know, the domain of the zoning board and very small,

741
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:45,852
[SPEAKER_03]: small potatoes things most of the time, technically those all need to come to the community development board now, but which is not, that doesn't make any sense.

742
01:17:45,892 --> 01:17:48,733
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely an oversight and an error.

743
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:59,996
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just want to correct that to specify that which kinds of special permits go to the seating board for a recommendation.

744
01:18:00,016 --> 01:18:02,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause as we know the,

745
01:18:04,368 --> 01:18:16,819
[SPEAKER_03]: The city council is a special permit granting authority and they're not necessarily having like the background and expertise and planning and really benefit from review and a recommendation from your board.

746
01:18:16,839 --> 01:18:26,008
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's lots of special permits that we definitely would want input on, but some of these like for zoning border just unnecessary.

747
01:18:29,434 --> 01:18:40,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, there was some kind of quick fixes that we wanted to do to also comply with the 3A zoning.

748
01:18:41,599 --> 01:18:57,266
[SPEAKER_03]: One of those is our inclusionary zoning provisions of our ordinance require a special permit to get your inclusionary housing, which makes no sense to me.

749
01:18:57,286 --> 01:18:58,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I always thought that was weird.

750
01:19:00,548 --> 01:19:08,556
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the requirements of the 3A provisions is that multifamily be by right and only subject to site plan review.

751
01:19:08,716 --> 01:19:13,520
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we have this provision in our inclusionary zoning, that's not in compliance.

752
01:19:15,222 --> 01:19:24,570
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now we're having, going off topic a little bit, but an economic feasibility analysis, just so we can use our inclusionary zoning at all.

753
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:30,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but we knew at least get out this, get rid of the special permit, you know, that doesn't comply.

754
01:19:30,781 --> 01:19:38,943
[SPEAKER_03]: And while we have some of these quick fixes going before you, we might as well, uh, get that in there, uh, benign.

755
01:19:38,963 --> 01:19:43,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's see what else was there.

756
01:19:43,224 --> 01:19:49,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's those updates.

757
01:19:50,773 --> 01:19:58,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Just little things like changing DHCD to EOHLC to acknowledge the new name.

758
01:20:00,499 --> 01:20:19,251
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that happened when the zoning was recodified is, I'm guessing, I'm thinking this is what happens was the zoning was in, I mean, the definitions that were section specific were to be moved to the definition section.

759
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:21,595
[SPEAKER_03]: but that didn't happen.

760
01:20:21,635 --> 01:20:23,176
[SPEAKER_03]: So they just got completely dropped.

761
01:20:24,217 --> 01:20:29,479
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to restore those, get them back in.

762
01:20:29,539 --> 01:20:38,203
[SPEAKER_03]: So like all of the affordable housing definitions are not in the zoning linkage, not in the zoning, just there's lots of them.

763
01:20:39,183 --> 01:20:42,245
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to, I mean, that was a mistake.

764
01:20:42,285 --> 01:20:46,187
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just need to get that in there and fix that.

765
01:20:47,827 --> 01:20:48,268
[SPEAKER_03]: And

766
01:20:50,365 --> 01:20:53,127
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the, so this was, you know, a collaborative process.

767
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:56,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Our office has been keeping like a laundry list of things that need to be changed.

768
01:20:57,170 --> 01:21:18,526
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the amendments was, you know, originated from city council and that was to change the table of use and parking regulations so that motor vehicle uses would be by special permit and not by right in some of the zoning districts.

769
01:21:20,597 --> 01:21:38,281
[SPEAKER_03]: This adds a layer of, you know, being able to have discretionary review, um, you know, on a site by state site basis, um, for example, um, you know, the certain parts of the city that have been, um, identified in the comprehensive plan as.

770
01:21:38,301 --> 01:21:46,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, proposed for, you know, different uses for, for housing, for,

771
01:21:47,010 --> 01:21:47,670
[SPEAKER_03]: mixed use.

772
01:21:48,351 --> 01:21:52,773
[SPEAKER_03]: And currently, you know, sections of like the Mystic Gap corridor are in the zone industrial.

773
01:21:53,613 --> 01:22:01,337
[SPEAKER_03]: But you, so you have an industrial zone that's in several places throughout the city.

774
01:22:01,797 --> 01:22:13,262
[SPEAKER_03]: So an industrial use or a motor vehicle use might be okay in an industrial zone somewhere else in the city, maybe not right on the main Mystic Gap corridor.

775
01:22:13,282 --> 01:22:14,603
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be okay in a different

776
01:22:15,434 --> 01:22:17,276
[SPEAKER_03]: part of that zoning district somewhere else.

777
01:22:17,776 --> 01:22:40,415
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanna be able to review projects at the more site-by-site basis to see if it's appropriate or detrimental and be able to apply the criteria for the issuance of a special permit, because there could be some real detriment to some uses that they end up in certain locations.

778
01:22:41,516 --> 01:22:43,898
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is in participant that,

779
01:22:44,653 --> 01:22:49,594
[SPEAKER_03]: And I did write a memo, I dropped it in today.

780
01:22:51,515 --> 01:23:11,340
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if we can, I'd have to maybe check with legal counsel, but I would want to actually expand that, the amendments to the table of uses to, you know, in addition to motor vehicle uses there, there's some other,

781
01:23:13,416 --> 01:23:26,744
[SPEAKER_03]: misaligned uses that we can, you know, refer to the comprehensive plan that would require like a little bit more analysis to pick those out.

782
01:23:29,966 --> 01:23:41,633
[SPEAKER_03]: But for example, like warehouses, maybe the warehouse use should be by special permit and not by right, just so to have a, you know, so it's just not a straight building permit, you know,

783
01:23:43,536 --> 01:23:52,202
[SPEAKER_03]: So not just motor vehicle uses, I think this could be a good opportunity to examine some of the other uses so that it's not straight by right.

784
01:23:52,762 --> 01:23:57,785
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of uses that are very benign that already require special permits.

785
01:24:02,208 --> 01:24:11,694
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just go through the table, like a convenience retail that needs like a special permit,

786
01:24:14,379 --> 01:24:18,041
[SPEAKER_03]: a car dealership doesn't, you know, it's just, it doesn't seem right.

787
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:23,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, just kind of, and which one is that Danielle?

788
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:25,925
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry that you're looking at right now.

789
01:24:26,946 --> 01:24:28,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just looking at the table of uses.

790
01:24:28,387 --> 01:24:36,051
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first amendment in the list of, um, amendments is to amend the table of uses.

791
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:40,813
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was for the motor vehicle related uses.

792
01:24:42,154 --> 01:24:42,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,

793
01:24:44,185 --> 01:24:46,086
[SPEAKER_03]: to switch them from by right.

794
01:24:46,166 --> 01:24:52,609
[SPEAKER_03]: So, a Y in the table to whichever is the SPGA.

795
01:24:53,349 --> 01:25:02,253
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe city council made themselves the SPGA.

796
01:25:03,493 --> 01:25:11,336
[SPEAKER_03]: In those situations where it's a special permit for use, this would need a referral from the community development board and a recommendation.

797
01:25:22,609 --> 01:25:37,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Danielle, since you were just mentioning that, I will comment that there's some question as to who should be the special permit granting authority, whether it should be the city council or the community development board.

798
01:25:38,581 --> 01:25:51,491
[SPEAKER_13]: And the Councilors that I spoke to about preparing this were very amenable to the idea that it could be the community development board would be the permit granting authority rather than the city council.

799
01:25:52,733 --> 01:25:55,702
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes it very political when it's the city council.

800
01:25:56,862 --> 01:26:22,204
[SPEAKER_13]: but they thought that that might come better as a recommendation from the community development board, which I thought was interesting because it could seem like the city, the community development board was kind of doing a power grab, but they were basically feeling more like it would be helpful for the Councilors for whom this was not their idea to hear that

801
01:26:23,485 --> 01:26:28,667
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be a would make sense for this Community Development Board to be the permit granting authority.

802
01:26:29,908 --> 01:26:40,492
[SPEAKER_13]: And basically, if this board agreed with that they could make that as a recommendation back to the council, and then the council could think about it and discuss it.

803
01:26:41,713 --> 01:26:45,074
[SPEAKER_13]: If we did not recommend it, it's unlikely they would change it.

804
01:26:48,192 --> 01:26:48,953
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, sorry.

805
01:26:49,473 --> 01:26:54,416
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, this is Alicia hunt for people watching on TV sorry I wasn't on earlier.

806
01:26:55,557 --> 01:27:00,020
[SPEAKER_13]: The director of planning and development is on a much needed vacation.

807
01:27:02,883 --> 01:27:04,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's why my cameras off.

808
01:27:06,645 --> 01:27:14,711
[SPEAKER_04]: So Alicia, and for the newer board members, I remember you laid this out for us in a meeting on June 7 and pretty much one of the uses and

809
01:27:15,118 --> 01:27:16,839
[SPEAKER_04]: being a special permit granting.

810
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:23,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that the city feels as though it's probably easier for it to go to the community development board.

811
01:27:24,904 --> 01:27:37,273
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know the position of the rest of the board at this point, but if we can just, I guess for my own purposes, I was able to talk to Danielle and Amanda earlier.

812
01:27:37,933 --> 01:27:40,255
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can just give a little bit more context

813
01:27:41,978 --> 01:27:47,943
[SPEAKER_04]: of why you probably want to keep it with community development board as a special permit granting agency.

814
01:27:49,784 --> 01:27:52,666
[SPEAKER_13]: So a lot of that has to do, there are a couple of reasons.

815
01:27:53,046 --> 01:27:55,648
[SPEAKER_13]: One is when it's the city Councilors are all elected.

816
01:27:56,349 --> 01:27:59,271
[SPEAKER_13]: And when they're the special granting authority.

817
01:27:59,291 --> 01:28:00,191
[SPEAKER_13]: They are.

818
01:28:04,073 --> 01:28:10,718
[SPEAKER_13]: very political in how things happen because they do have to be elected where a board is appointed.

819
01:28:10,738 --> 01:28:24,928
[SPEAKER_13]: The Community Development Board is a board of people who understand planning and the aspects that go into planning and are more objective.

820
01:28:25,108 --> 01:28:28,570
[SPEAKER_13]: In theory, they also understand the comprehensive plan.

821
01:28:29,491 --> 01:28:37,256
[SPEAKER_13]: And one thing to think about is, yes, I am literally talking about you on the call tonight, but we're talking about ordinances.

822
01:28:37,796 --> 01:28:42,158
[SPEAKER_13]: The last time ordinances were changed dramatically in Medford was 60 years ago.

823
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:45,140
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're not literally just talking about you.

824
01:28:45,160 --> 01:28:52,224
[SPEAKER_13]: We are talking about who are the people, the kind of people that will be appointed to planning boards over the next 30 years.

825
01:28:53,665 --> 01:29:08,416
[SPEAKER_13]: and who gets elected to city council, and sort of what their background is in their role, and they don't necessarily as city Councilors representing the community, understand the nuances of planning the interactions of different kinds of

826
01:29:10,646 --> 01:29:17,831
[SPEAKER_13]: uses with each other because the old school planning, you actually separated all the uses.

827
01:29:18,331 --> 01:29:22,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Today, you want more mixed use in order to have a more modern community.

828
01:29:23,574 --> 01:29:31,419
[SPEAKER_13]: On the other hand, you don't necessarily want a car dealership or a car repair shop right next to where people are living.

829
01:29:31,479 --> 01:29:33,000
[SPEAKER_13]: It's sort of like the old industrial.

830
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:33,761
[SPEAKER_13]: Today's

831
01:29:34,561 --> 01:29:40,756
[SPEAKER_13]: industrial is way more modern and maybe you do want it mixed in, whereas you wouldn't have wanted an old shoe factory.

832
01:29:43,442 --> 01:30:04,750
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that part of the reason this is up and on the table now is because some of the city Councilors became aware and brought to my attention that there was a company that was going around trying to find places on mystic have or car dealerships and repair shops that were being priced out of Somerville and zoned out of Somerville.

833
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:15,135
[SPEAKER_13]: And there is a vision in our community development in our comprehensive plan that mystic have should be more mixed use should become walkable and more friendly.

834
01:30:15,596 --> 01:30:19,398
[SPEAKER_13]: And while there are a lot of car repair places in dealerships there.

835
01:30:19,798 --> 01:30:24,841
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not the vision of the future of mystic have, and they wanted to

836
01:30:25,930 --> 01:30:43,035
[SPEAKER_13]: change the zoning on these items in that area immediately to put some control on it so that new businesses couldn't come in as of right while we were working on rezoning the entire area to more match our comprehensive plan.

837
01:30:43,475 --> 01:30:45,956
[SPEAKER_13]: So they actually asked to rush these through.

838
01:30:46,536 --> 01:30:48,636
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not telling you you have to vote on these tonight.

839
01:30:48,696 --> 01:30:50,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Danielle actually needs to do some more editing to

840
01:30:51,253 --> 01:31:00,404
[SPEAKER_13]: bring things in line with what the legal advice, but that's why we're doing it this summer, and not waiting until we do a full rezoning of the whole city.

841
01:31:02,106 --> 01:31:11,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for reading that I do know that there was a clarifying question that was asked because the way it was presented originally just for myself anyways and it sounds like maybe another board member.

842
01:31:11,995 --> 01:31:14,777
[SPEAKER_04]: with the question was that it sounded like someone was trying to come in.

843
01:31:14,817 --> 01:31:30,267
[SPEAKER_04]: So the way that you explained that, it's not that it was like, it sounded more like a political kind of thing where it's like, now you have these appointed members that are, um, are sort of, um, responsible for these, uh, permits case by case basis.

844
01:31:30,348 --> 01:31:31,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not what you're saying.

845
01:31:31,628 --> 01:31:39,694
[SPEAKER_04]: What you're saying is that you want to make it that's well-formed so that we're able to get the highest and best uses for the space on Mystic Ave as opposed to.

846
01:31:40,605 --> 01:31:45,630
[SPEAKER_04]: just having like a lot of parking lots and in automobiles and things like that.

847
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:49,194
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want I just wanted to clarify that piece.

848
01:31:49,954 --> 01:31:50,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

849
01:31:50,335 --> 01:31:54,198
[SPEAKER_13]: And perhaps it would be helpful for me to be very super specific.

850
01:31:55,460 --> 01:31:57,682
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's actually a couple of things going on.

851
01:31:57,742 --> 01:32:02,967
[SPEAKER_13]: And one is that there was somebody just trying to find new locations for these dealers coming out of Somerville.

852
01:32:03,527 --> 01:32:06,429
[SPEAKER_13]: in general, and that was concerning.

853
01:32:07,350 --> 01:32:13,674
[SPEAKER_13]: It is also true that Herb Chambers has bought the old Century Bank Eastern Bank location.

854
01:32:14,294 --> 01:32:26,341
[SPEAKER_13]: And that actually might be a perfectly fine location for him to keep that beautiful big building there, keep everything there, add in a car dealership, there is a chance that he might move his headquarters there.

855
01:32:26,862 --> 01:32:31,525
[SPEAKER_13]: And that might actually be an okay example of something because we're not

856
01:32:32,265 --> 01:32:36,148
[SPEAKER_13]: just moving into another empty space we're not bringing in another one.

857
01:32:37,209 --> 01:32:42,273
[SPEAKER_13]: It would in fact be his corporate headquarters at that location if he did that.

858
01:32:43,354 --> 01:32:54,743
[SPEAKER_13]: But this changing this from as of right to special permit would mean that there could be some controls there could be a lot of talk about trees and stuff and how do we

859
01:32:55,562 --> 01:33:02,087
[SPEAKER_13]: do it all, and making sure that the businesses that come in are correct.

860
01:33:02,127 --> 01:33:17,038
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just do want to be upfront that we are aware that he, and in fact I met with him, he was looking at a couple of places in Medford, and I basically said we are not looking for two or three new car dealerships on Mystic Valley Parkway and Mystic Ave.

861
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:22,483
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if you wanted to bring one into that Eastern Bank building, that

862
01:33:23,143 --> 01:33:30,925
[SPEAKER_13]: might be something that would be a good you know he could be a good member of the community, but we are not looking for this to be the new auto mile.

863
01:33:30,945 --> 01:33:44,930
[SPEAKER_04]: So, so this is like an interim step to hold over to the zoning revisions that you also mentioned it was the city was going to hire a consultant to do a redraft so that we can be better guided going forward.

864
01:33:45,610 --> 01:33:51,492
[SPEAKER_04]: And I, and you said there was going to be maybe a chunk of these administrative kind of changes coming through and we should probably move.

865
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:57,381
[SPEAKER_04]: fast as possible, but what is the best way for them to be presented as Danielle's doing tonight?

866
01:33:58,121 --> 01:34:08,284
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're not voting on them, are we just going over them and then we'll, I mean, I guess I should let Danielle finish talking.

867
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:16,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, they're not ready tonight, but I hope that I would have something for the next meeting.

868
01:34:16,466 --> 01:34:21,127
[SPEAKER_03]: There was some language that, you know, to the form of some of it,

869
01:34:22,005 --> 01:34:23,826
[SPEAKER_03]: that we have some questions on.

870
01:34:24,906 --> 01:34:38,351
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to make sure that what is being recommended to city council has been, you know, has been reviewed by legal for forum and for content.

871
01:34:40,792 --> 01:34:43,333
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to have the conversation now.

872
01:34:43,353 --> 01:34:48,435
[SPEAKER_03]: And if there's anything like conceptually off that you

873
01:34:49,663 --> 01:35:05,853
[SPEAKER_03]: don't like, like now's the time to mention that before we finalize the language to bring back in two weeks for a vote of whether to recommend it to city council.

874
01:35:06,929 --> 01:35:07,149
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

875
01:35:07,309 --> 01:35:15,374
[SPEAKER_13]: The, the process is that it went to city council, we sent it to legal for review and you have the lawyers comments in front of you.

876
01:35:15,394 --> 01:35:19,657
[SPEAKER_13]: And it would be best.

877
01:35:20,618 --> 01:35:23,340
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is technically the opening of the public hearing.

878
01:35:24,383 --> 01:35:27,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, the city council also has to have a public hearing, which was advertised.

879
01:35:28,485 --> 01:35:36,648
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be best if the version that was voted out of this body included all the recommendations from the lawyers.

880
01:35:38,068 --> 01:35:43,210
[SPEAKER_13]: And we don't have the final drafted language for that.

881
01:35:43,711 --> 01:35:43,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

882
01:35:44,011 --> 01:35:46,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, so if you look at that, you'll see that the.

883
01:35:47,152 --> 01:35:50,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of them, the lawyer says this is appropriate as to form.

884
01:35:51,093 --> 01:35:57,155
[SPEAKER_13]: And some of them, they said, here's what you need to change to make it legally correct.

885
01:35:57,655 --> 01:36:15,040
[SPEAKER_13]: And we would prefer if when this board votes it to city council, you have all the legally correct stuff so that the council can see that the planning board is giving them not just the ideas, but the final language that they should vote on.

886
01:36:17,078 --> 01:36:24,803
[SPEAKER_13]: And I apologize that we didn't have that for tonight we were hoping but we just had too many things to move forward to get that finished for tonight.

887
01:36:30,146 --> 01:36:41,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sorry I asked a lot of questions based on prior knowledge I don't know, Daniel if you were finished with your presentation or if you wanted to open it up to the board to ask questions.

888
01:36:42,933 --> 01:36:44,895
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess I would be looking some at some direction.

889
01:36:46,570 --> 01:37:14,363
[SPEAKER_03]: about what other uses would, ought to be special permits and not by right, as I think it would be good for this board to also put that forward with who should be the SPGA and which additional,

890
01:37:15,966 --> 01:37:35,402
[SPEAKER_03]: uses should also be included as, you know, getting, you know, some extra review and, you know, vetting before, you know, they just get a building permit, you know, by right.

891
01:37:36,483 --> 01:37:44,009
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as we were mentioning earlier this morning in our call, I think what I'm going to do is

892
01:37:45,261 --> 01:37:52,664
[SPEAKER_03]: just look at a zoning map, identify which zones are in some of these quarter areas.

893
01:37:52,704 --> 01:37:58,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's tricky because like Mystic Ave has multiple zoning districts.

894
01:38:00,648 --> 01:38:01,829
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just one example.

895
01:38:01,849 --> 01:38:11,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's, of course my GIS is not,

896
01:38:12,200 --> 01:38:13,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Updating.

897
01:38:13,021 --> 01:38:15,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to see what these zones are.

898
01:38:15,463 --> 01:38:20,428
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a paper map.

899
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:24,953
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, so we have like just a longnistic app we have.

900
01:38:24,973 --> 01:38:25,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

901
01:38:27,415 --> 01:38:29,638
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the

902
01:38:38,767 --> 01:38:40,408
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an industrial zone.

903
01:38:40,869 --> 01:38:42,029
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this dark blue?

904
01:38:42,069 --> 01:38:53,317
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the, yeah, we had, there's a C2, there's apartment one, there's another little, you know, blotch of industrial zoned area.

905
01:38:53,377 --> 01:38:59,221
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one of those things where, you know, the industrial zone over maybe deep,

906
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:32,232
[SPEAKER_03]: into, you know, Riverside might be okay to have something, but maybe, you know, but not even there, like there's, you know, like the whole like Locust Street, Riverside, and Mystic Valley Parkway commercial is also an area that is envisioned to be so much more, and it's currently, you know, zoned, you know, industrial, and there's some C1, and it's just, it's a hodgepodge that the zoning districts don't align with really any

907
01:39:33,425 --> 01:39:34,966
[SPEAKER_03]: natural boundaries.

908
01:39:40,791 --> 01:39:45,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you want us to do this as an exercise along with you or separate?

909
01:39:45,995 --> 01:39:48,456
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to figure out the best way to go through.

910
01:39:48,476 --> 01:39:59,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess just if I could get some direction that this is a concept that you would sign off on for me to do.

911
01:40:03,470 --> 01:40:05,431
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any particular uses?

912
01:40:05,491 --> 01:40:15,875
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at your table of uses, is there anything that jumps out at you that's like, this really shouldn't be a why, this should be a special permit?

913
01:40:19,837 --> 01:40:22,738
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of it is a little subjective.

914
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:31,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to tie the planning decisions to planning documents as best as I can.

915
01:40:33,353 --> 01:40:52,190
[SPEAKER_03]: the comprehensive plan has kind of like an overarching vision and goals that it sets for different areas, but almost all of the recommendations is like this area should be studied further to really get to the minutia of what the new zoning should be.

916
01:40:52,210 --> 01:40:58,155
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it takes so long, but on a higher level, we know that we don't want Mystic Ave to be

917
01:40:58,733 --> 01:41:08,319
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, auto body shops and we don't, you know, we don't want, you know, a new warehouse there or, you know, open air parking.

918
01:41:10,380 --> 01:41:10,920
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's this.

919
01:41:15,223 --> 01:41:26,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still trying to like, I mean, I could take a stab at this for you guys to react to, but I guess I'm just looking for like any input that you might have that I should pay attention to.

920
01:41:27,733 --> 01:41:29,194
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, Pam talking.

921
01:41:29,374 --> 01:41:34,536
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just trying to wrap my head around what you're asking, Danielle, just as somebody who's like new to this.

922
01:41:35,576 --> 01:41:42,198
[SPEAKER_15]: So are you asking like in terms of like direction around what kind of uses we're looking at?

923
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:52,802
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we just looking, are we just talking about these motor vehicle uses or are you asking us to weigh in on like other uses apart from motor vehicle uses that we should be looking at?

924
01:41:53,263 --> 01:41:54,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Other uses, so I'm looking at

925
01:41:55,212 --> 01:42:08,665
[SPEAKER_03]: what other uses beyond motor vehicle should also become special permits versus by right in some of these zoning districts.

926
01:42:09,386 --> 01:42:10,047
[SPEAKER_03]: And okay.

927
01:42:12,733 --> 01:42:17,814
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just trying to get to like the page of the thing that has the tables with the uses.

928
01:42:18,014 --> 01:42:19,535
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, I'm at very light.

929
01:42:19,575 --> 01:42:19,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

930
01:42:19,995 --> 01:42:24,976
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd have to go to the zoning ordinance, which has been updated, which is great.

931
01:42:24,996 --> 01:42:30,458
[SPEAKER_13]: Danielle, maybe you want to change, share your screen, but I do want to just caution people.

932
01:42:30,998 --> 01:42:31,838
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree.

933
01:42:31,878 --> 01:42:38,560
[SPEAKER_13]: And I understand with what Daniel's trying to get at is, is there more than just these few that the council wanted to change?

934
01:42:38,980 --> 01:42:40,341
[SPEAKER_13]: Should we throw a few more in there?

935
01:42:40,801 --> 01:42:45,062
[SPEAKER_13]: But I will point out that all of their changes right now are C2.

936
01:42:45,342 --> 01:42:49,984
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just Mystic Ave is what's on the table, what they've proposed to change.

937
01:42:50,604 --> 01:42:54,406
[SPEAKER_13]: And they targeted the motor vehicle uses in particular.

938
01:42:55,947 --> 01:43:10,195
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe there's more than what we want to do, but I do caution you not to go so broad that it confuses everything and nothing gets passed because it's so much more than they intended to do in this pass.

939
01:43:12,017 --> 01:43:22,402
[SPEAKER_13]: But it might be easier, Danielle, if you shared your screen to show it to everybody, because also the, if there are members of the public watching, which actually I realize you're not on TV tonight, is it?

940
01:43:22,482 --> 01:43:25,824
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no, but this is being recorded to be shared later.

941
01:43:26,864 --> 01:43:28,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Other people could not follow along.

942
01:43:39,203 --> 01:43:41,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I'm gonna have to go soon.

943
01:43:41,325 --> 01:43:45,530
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just wanted to see if there were any other questions on any of them.

944
01:43:46,832 --> 01:43:50,796
[SPEAKER_13]: It is absolutely our goal to get this voted out at the next meeting.

945
01:43:52,098 --> 01:43:56,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Danielle doesn't have enough time to get these changes made by them, then I'll make sure I take care of them.

946
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:01,801
[SPEAKER_13]: because we do want, the council is anxious to get these passed.

947
01:44:02,421 --> 01:44:13,364
[SPEAKER_13]: And just so you're aware, the city council and I tried to hire consultant help with large scale zoning changes, and we did not get any applicants for that.

948
01:44:13,984 --> 01:44:20,985
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are gonna be putting that out to bid again to hire a consultant to do basically an 18 month process.

949
01:44:21,405 --> 01:44:27,247
[SPEAKER_13]: So right now changing the shapes of the map is not in question, it's just the uses.

950
01:44:28,848 --> 01:44:34,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Changing the map is a much bigger issue that we could not possibly take on at this round of changes.

951
01:44:36,654 --> 01:44:50,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so basically it's just what yeses in the table should be flipped to a special permit and who should choose the SPJB.

952
01:44:50,846 --> 01:44:54,529
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be a huge thing, but like right here, can you see my cursor?

953
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:01,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Like here's Mystic Ave, like, yeah, so it is mostly like C2, but you just get off there a little bit.

954
01:45:01,881 --> 01:45:05,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Then here's like industrial, like, should we care about those?

955
01:45:05,782 --> 01:45:12,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Because here's an industrial zone here that is Locust Street, commercial.

956
01:45:13,704 --> 01:45:25,007
[SPEAKER_03]: This was an area that was identified in the comp plan as, you know, it could be, you know, mixed-use denser,

957
01:45:25,805 --> 01:45:29,766
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, housing, jobs, things like that there.

958
01:45:30,327 --> 01:45:48,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and this also is going to be this at some point, uh, soon we'll be bringing a proposed overlay to comply with MBTA zoning in that overlay would be around the Wellington station.

959
01:45:48,912 --> 01:45:53,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so that would

960
01:45:54,430 --> 01:45:55,650
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, make certain things by right.

961
01:45:55,670 --> 01:46:11,695
[SPEAKER_03]: So like in the interim, it would be a shame if someone came in and put, you know, like in a warehouse down in one of these prime sites that, you know, could be housing.

962
01:46:11,715 --> 01:46:17,597
[SPEAKER_03]: And we know that we're planning for this.

963
01:46:18,237 --> 01:46:19,738
[SPEAKER_03]: So is there, should we,

964
01:46:20,650 --> 01:46:35,054
[SPEAKER_03]: While they're focused on Mystic Ave and the C2s to keep Auto Body out, I should add that Herb Chambers was also looking on Mystic Parkway as well.

965
01:46:37,155 --> 01:46:40,515
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not just Mystic Ave.

966
01:46:40,555 --> 01:46:45,317
[SPEAKER_03]: These main corridors are important.

967
01:46:46,982 --> 01:46:53,866
[SPEAKER_04]: So we respect to the timing of this as Alicia has already pointed out and making sure that it's not convoluted to get it pushed through city council.

968
01:46:56,447 --> 01:47:00,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Assuming that all board members, including myself would have to be read.

969
01:47:02,923 --> 01:47:10,329
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have to like just read the comprehensive plan again for the use table just to see what the vision is and what we want to put there for the future.

970
01:47:10,349 --> 01:47:17,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you're well versed in what's what the city has for a vision Danielle so if you can

971
01:47:18,355 --> 01:47:26,680
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe point out some high level things you mentioned earlier, something about a convenience store, it's a shame that they have to have a special permit, but something else didn't.

972
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:40,147
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you can give us some high level things that we can actually deliberate on, and not so much telling us exactly what we should be changing, but just give us a little bit more to like, just zoom in for the sake of time.

973
01:47:42,099 --> 01:47:45,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so like hopefully because this, we want it to be an expedited process.

974
01:47:46,641 --> 01:47:58,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we could get this through at the next meeting, but maybe it wouldn't be expertise communications or violation of meeting.

975
01:47:58,728 --> 01:48:04,871
[SPEAKER_03]: If something pops into your head, just send me an email and then I'll incorporate it.

976
01:48:04,911 --> 01:48:11,515
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once you get your meeting packet materials

977
01:48:12,038 --> 01:48:23,783
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make sure to prioritize getting this to you with an advance notice as possible so that you've seen it, digested it, and ready to say, yeah, this looks good.

978
01:48:31,906 --> 01:48:35,707
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could also say that you don't wanna deal with this.

979
01:48:36,728 --> 01:48:37,368
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the board.

980
01:48:38,725 --> 01:48:55,617
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just thought it might be a good opportunity to just like slip a few more things in where I think are also important locations because I get emails every week from, you know, permit expediters asking about uses in certain areas.

981
01:48:55,677 --> 01:49:06,085
[SPEAKER_03]: Thankfully, sometimes it's the wrong Medford and I have a little heart attack about, they wanted to, they're like, we want to put this warehouse distribution center over in,

982
01:49:06,595 --> 01:49:08,456
[SPEAKER_03]: In Medford, I'm like, oh no.

983
01:49:10,077 --> 01:49:11,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And then think, I was like, wrong Medford.

984
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:21,202
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of them, it's like, there's uses that are just, they look at the zoning, they're like, oh, this is a by right use, they must want this.

985
01:49:21,863 --> 01:49:25,284
[SPEAKER_03]: They look at the zoning, they think, this is what we want.

986
01:49:25,565 --> 01:49:29,286
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the message that we're sending in the interim.

987
01:49:29,326 --> 01:49:36,350
[SPEAKER_03]: So pump the brakes a little bit by making something a special permit.

988
01:49:40,387 --> 01:49:41,688
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll have something for you to review.

989
01:49:41,728 --> 01:49:44,050
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something for you guys to kind of like think about now.

990
01:49:44,230 --> 01:50:07,187
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have any ideas during, you know, looking at the zoning map and what uses are allowed there and where it is, knowing that we have, you know, certain zoning districts that aren't, you know, location specific, like there's multiple I zones, multiple C2 zones.

991
01:50:11,767 --> 01:50:14,428
[SPEAKER_03]: we aren't outright prohibiting uses.

992
01:50:15,288 --> 01:50:28,551
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I was saying, like, you know, say right here, like in the eye zone, right on Locust Street might not be a good use, might not be a good location for industrial use, but maybe it's fine tucked over here.

993
01:50:29,151 --> 01:50:39,593
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just gives us the ability to make these, to make the call on a location basis rather than a floodgates are just open.

994
01:50:41,197 --> 01:50:47,100
[SPEAKER_03]: And once the site is redeveloped for use, it's like that for a long time until you wait for it to turn over.

995
01:50:47,120 --> 01:50:52,923
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they're buying property and developing it today, they're gonna keep it for a while.

996
01:50:59,006 --> 01:50:59,606
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have.

997
01:51:00,567 --> 01:51:01,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Danielle.

998
01:51:01,427 --> 01:51:02,648
[SPEAKER_04]: So it is a public meeting.

999
01:51:03,731 --> 01:51:07,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanna make sure that we got all of the board's questions.

1000
01:51:08,114 --> 01:51:20,941
[SPEAKER_04]: I still do have, I believe a couple of questions, but I guess I'll table them for when you said you're gonna sort of clean this up and, cause we can't really vote on it tonight, correct?

1001
01:51:21,161 --> 01:51:27,485
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there's nothing to vote on tonight because you don't have a specific language that has to be updated for some of these amendments.

1002
01:51:29,746 --> 01:51:31,487
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just too short a turnaround to,

1003
01:51:35,098 --> 01:51:37,360
[SPEAKER_03]: make the changes that legal is asking.

1004
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:42,503
[SPEAKER_03]: We have some questions to make sure we get the language correct.

1005
01:51:43,804 --> 01:51:49,908
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically it's just like the concept, the idea that just are we on it?

1006
01:51:50,929 --> 01:51:56,893
[SPEAKER_03]: Does everything seem to be on the right track of what is being proposed to city council?

1007
01:51:59,234 --> 01:52:04,178
[SPEAKER_03]: That sort of thing is this is like the discussion for like even kind of like that litmus test and

1008
01:52:07,253 --> 01:52:08,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, this seems reasonable to me.

1009
01:52:09,875 --> 01:52:11,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it definitely does.

1010
01:52:12,016 --> 01:52:17,801
[SPEAKER_04]: And I actually like that we have the lawyer's comments that can set us straight here.

1011
01:52:17,901 --> 01:52:22,124
[SPEAKER_04]: So it keeps us straight, actually.

1012
01:52:23,605 --> 01:52:33,372
[SPEAKER_04]: And had I known that you wanted us to do that exercise, I could have looked at the use, we could have all looked at the use table to get it done a little bit faster.

1013
01:52:34,843 --> 01:52:42,348
[SPEAKER_03]: was something that popped into my head kind of like today, like, or maybe a couple of days, like, no, I really want to do more.

1014
01:52:43,669 --> 01:52:49,292
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, should I, you know, take that on now?

1015
01:52:49,312 --> 01:52:50,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yeah, I should.

1016
01:52:53,555 --> 01:53:03,061
[SPEAKER_04]: My interest is how to sort of see what the board is feeling about being the special grant authority for

1017
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:08,191
[SPEAKER_04]: as presented for these changes?

1018
01:53:10,552 --> 01:53:16,673
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that we don't have all members in attendance, but I guess that's one of my main questions.

1019
01:53:21,975 --> 01:53:31,278
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that that is a big question that we should discuss as a larger group and in public.

1020
01:53:33,885 --> 01:53:34,125
[SPEAKER_16]: We are.

1021
01:53:34,265 --> 01:53:37,748
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, which I think to me means it should be for the next meeting.

1022
01:53:37,768 --> 01:53:43,513
[SPEAKER_04]: It's definitely this is a public hearing now, just, uh, reiterate.

1023
01:53:45,695 --> 01:53:46,596
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I know.

1024
01:53:47,036 --> 01:53:47,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Um.

1025
01:54:03,491 --> 01:54:09,817
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think my vote is that this is certainly an interesting avenue to pursue.

1026
01:54:09,917 --> 01:54:18,224
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't have kind of any objections to it at this moment, but I would like to have a bit more time to like go through and think about it and dive in.

1027
01:54:18,304 --> 01:54:26,772
[SPEAKER_16]: And I imagine that the other members of the committee, including those who aren't there today might appreciate that option as well.

1028
01:54:27,272 --> 01:54:30,175
[SPEAKER_16]: So next week or not next week, next meeting.

1029
01:54:31,647 --> 01:54:32,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1030
01:54:32,227 --> 01:54:42,250
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, um, I have no objections overall, but at the same time, I would definitely like to have a full board, um, and to be able to weigh in on that.

1031
01:54:42,810 --> 01:54:56,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, but at the same time, I do know that they have the option to view, um, the recordings, but in order to provide, um, feedback to the planning staff.

1032
01:54:57,995 --> 01:54:58,455
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may, Chair?

1033
01:54:59,435 --> 01:54:59,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1034
01:55:00,876 --> 01:55:13,422
[SPEAKER_12]: So just a procedural note, because we opened the public hearing tonight, any other members who are not present tonight will have to watch this recording in order to participate.

1035
01:55:14,899 --> 01:55:17,480
[SPEAKER_12]: in the next meeting.

1036
01:55:18,040 --> 01:55:26,245
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's all just to say folks will have to see this if they want to participate.

1037
01:55:26,405 --> 01:55:34,890
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe if others have thoughts about some of this, it could still be worthwhile to talk about it a bit tonight.

1038
01:55:36,678 --> 01:55:39,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Definitely it's uh, thank you so much for reminding me of that.

1039
01:55:39,360 --> 01:56:01,818
[SPEAKER_04]: So based on the mullins statute, um any board member that's absent still gets its voting authority, but um, but at the same time they must attest to the fact that They have watched all statutory, um recordings or proceedings in order to participate so the absent members still get to participate but um

1040
01:56:02,779 --> 01:56:11,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess, who would, would the city actually give them that option to participate with tonight, or would they just know to do that, Amanda?

1041
01:56:12,484 --> 01:56:30,953
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll follow up with Peter and Emily, and actually, we'll have another member joining us by next meeting named Sherrod to provide them with the recording and let them know that, you know, if they want to participate, participate and deliberate, they'll need to watch it and attest that they've seen it.

1042
01:56:33,048 --> 01:56:38,449
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the case of Sherrod, is this a full member or is this a associate member?

1043
01:56:38,990 --> 01:56:39,550
[SPEAKER_12]: Good point.

1044
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:41,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Full member, but you're right.

1045
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:46,172
[SPEAKER_12]: They would not be able to participate because they're not yet sworn in.

1046
01:56:46,512 --> 01:56:49,872
[SPEAKER_03]: So they can participate in the discussions, but they just can't vote.

1047
01:56:52,453 --> 01:56:59,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like Pam and Sally, you can participate and weigh in on each mark and just don't have a vote.

1048
01:57:00,631 --> 01:57:04,012
[SPEAKER_04]: And have we, we've definitely confirmed that based on the Mullen statute, right?

1049
01:57:04,052 --> 01:57:06,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there was some nuances around the word absence.

1050
01:57:06,772 --> 01:57:22,716
[SPEAKER_04]: It says when a member is absent, they can still catch up and, you know, attest to the fact that they've read the statutorial proceedings, but absent meaning they would have had to have been an established board member at the time of, correct?

1051
01:57:22,736 --> 01:57:22,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1052
01:57:23,136 --> 01:57:23,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1053
01:57:23,376 --> 01:57:23,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1054
01:57:23,936 --> 01:57:26,277
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to make sure that we were clear on that because

1055
01:57:27,037 --> 01:57:35,741
[SPEAKER_04]: It couldn't be read wrong, but even another Metro resident, my husband, he read it and said, no, no, no, that's not how it goes.

1056
01:57:35,761 --> 01:57:39,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyways, I was just trying to make sure that we got clarity on that.

1057
01:57:42,985 --> 01:57:45,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, but because it is, we can continue to deliberate.

1058
01:57:46,646 --> 01:57:50,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Does any board members have any other questions before I open it up to the public?

1059
01:57:56,822 --> 01:57:59,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so I'm going to open public comment period.

1060
01:58:00,523 --> 01:58:03,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand feature.

1061
01:58:03,825 --> 01:58:07,806
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone's on or looking, message Amanda in the comments.

1062
01:58:08,186 --> 01:58:10,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure that anyone's on for that.

1063
01:58:10,887 --> 01:58:21,051
[SPEAKER_04]: But Amanda, if you can also send an email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

1064
01:58:21,671 --> 01:58:26,453
[SPEAKER_04]: And in saying that, again, I don't believe we have any members of the public on, but Amanda, if you can,

1065
01:58:27,482 --> 01:58:30,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, see if there's any emails or letters that were sent out.

1066
01:58:32,086 --> 01:58:33,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Regarding this item.

1067
01:58:34,388 --> 01:58:42,715
[SPEAKER_12]: So there were no prior, no comments received prior to the meeting, and I just refreshed our inbox and there are no new comments, um, at this time.

1068
01:58:42,975 --> 01:58:51,562
[SPEAKER_12]: And also confirming that I'm not seeing any, um, folks in our, uh, live audience here, um, in the public currently.

1069
01:58:52,042 --> 01:58:55,005
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so no comment at this time.

1070
01:58:55,947 --> 01:58:56,207
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1071
01:58:56,227 --> 01:59:01,671
[SPEAKER_04]: So procedurally, I will close the public comment period and board will go back to deliberation.

1072
01:59:01,711 --> 01:59:11,997
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is, uh, uh, another chance for us to discuss, um, the proposal, which, um, or hash out any questions since it's not really anything to vote on at this point.

1073
01:59:12,297 --> 01:59:22,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, if there's any adjustments or any concerns that the board may have, um, the proposed use of the use table or anything that you see that has been presented.

1074
01:59:23,143 --> 01:59:25,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, again, my, my.

1075
01:59:26,511 --> 01:59:41,063
[SPEAKER_04]: One of my only, cause I, I'm not, I'm a minimal to many things, but one of my questions is, um, have any other board members weigh in, but I guess they have to do their due diligence and catching up with tonight's public meeting to be able to participate in that.

1076
01:59:44,947 --> 01:59:47,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if any other board members have anything to add.

1077
01:59:47,529 --> 01:59:51,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm going to stop the share.

1078
01:59:52,032 --> 01:59:52,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1079
01:59:54,074 --> 01:59:54,695
[SPEAKER_02]: We see each other.

1080
02:00:02,493 --> 02:00:14,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay so this has to get out and because it's a public meeting it has to um I am going to say we should probably obviously continue this and it has to be a date certain correct?

1081
02:00:15,542 --> 02:00:15,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1082
02:00:15,762 --> 02:00:17,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So August 16th will be the next meeting.

1083
02:00:18,864 --> 02:00:31,513
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I can have a motion to continue this topic actually not this topic but the petition from PDS and City Hall proposing zoning ordinance amendments

1084
02:00:32,092 --> 02:00:35,715
[SPEAKER_04]: to August 16th, 2023 Community Development Meeting.

1085
02:00:37,897 --> 02:00:38,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion.

1086
02:00:40,218 --> 02:00:40,999
[SPEAKER_02]: And is there a second?

1087
02:00:41,059 --> 02:00:41,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

1088
02:00:42,340 --> 02:00:42,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1089
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:43,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Second, Sally.

1090
02:00:45,523 --> 02:00:46,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Sally.

1091
02:00:46,203 --> 02:00:48,305
[SPEAKER_02]: So for a roll call, Ari Goffman.

1092
02:00:54,650 --> 02:00:55,751
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're muted, Ari.

1093
02:00:58,673 --> 02:00:59,354
[SPEAKER_16]: My apologies.

1094
02:00:59,494 --> 02:01:00,755
[SPEAKER_16]: Ari Fishman now, but yes.

1095
02:01:04,614 --> 02:01:05,454
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

1096
02:01:05,495 --> 02:01:08,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought I changed it and I did it backwards.

1097
02:01:08,236 --> 02:01:09,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1098
02:01:10,358 --> 02:01:10,838
[SPEAKER_04]: No worries.

1099
02:01:11,218 --> 02:01:12,719
[SPEAKER_04]: My most sincere apologies.

1100
02:01:14,881 --> 02:01:15,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, Ari Fishman.

1101
02:01:17,002 --> 02:01:17,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1102
02:01:18,783 --> 02:01:19,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Pam Marionski.

1103
02:01:20,164 --> 02:01:20,424
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1104
02:01:21,325 --> 02:01:22,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Sally Akiki.

1105
02:01:23,306 --> 02:01:23,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1106
02:01:24,427 --> 02:01:26,509
[SPEAKER_04]: And myself, Jackie McPherson.

1107
02:01:26,769 --> 02:01:27,209
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a yes.

1108
02:01:29,370 --> 02:01:32,913
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will continue with our next item, which

1109
02:01:33,465 --> 02:01:34,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Board elections.

1110
02:01:36,068 --> 02:01:39,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, in the absence of two members, I'm not sure that we are prepared for this.

1111
02:01:40,552 --> 02:01:47,598
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Amanda, if you've received any interest for the clerk or the community preservation committee representative.

1112
02:01:47,658 --> 02:01:53,203
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know that Ari, you are concurrently holding over in CPA.

1113
02:01:54,244 --> 02:01:58,428
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know if we were restructuring or looking at that again.

1114
02:02:00,885 --> 02:02:04,566
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to see if we can convince any of the new people once they're voted on.

1115
02:02:05,306 --> 02:02:08,127
[SPEAKER_16]: But in the meantime, I want you to hold the post.

1116
02:02:09,007 --> 02:02:10,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, hold the post.

1117
02:02:13,208 --> 02:02:17,589
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an empty clerk seat as it stands?

1118
02:02:18,710 --> 02:02:19,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Correct.

1119
02:02:19,710 --> 02:02:20,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1120
02:02:23,291 --> 02:02:26,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so next item, approval of minutes.

1121
02:02:28,620 --> 02:02:34,124
[SPEAKER_04]: if I can actually have a motion to approve the minutes from 6-7-23.

1122
02:02:34,284 --> 02:02:35,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, this is a question I have.

1123
02:02:36,666 --> 02:02:41,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure, Pam and Sally, if you were in attendance or if you were even part of the board on 6-7.

1124
02:02:43,130 --> 02:02:46,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda, are they able to vote on the minutes?

1125
02:02:48,594 --> 02:02:50,816
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, this might be a Danielle question.

1126
02:02:50,836 --> 02:02:53,798
[SPEAKER_12]: Surprisingly, you can.

1127
02:02:53,818 --> 02:02:55,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1128
02:02:55,860 --> 02:02:57,281
[SPEAKER_03]: You can vote on

1129
02:02:58,222 --> 02:03:04,965
[SPEAKER_03]: minutes for meetings that you were not at, because a vote on the minutes is just, we got them.

1130
02:03:05,545 --> 02:03:06,725
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, that's all that matters.

1131
02:03:07,046 --> 02:03:10,587
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it means is that that was the opinion that I got from them.

1132
02:03:11,387 --> 02:03:15,949
[SPEAKER_03]: several city solicitor, when I said I needed to abstain because I wasn't at that meeting.

1133
02:03:15,989 --> 02:03:17,370
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, Nope, you can go.

1134
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:19,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, really, but I don't even know what happened.

1135
02:03:19,871 --> 02:03:27,594
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, you're just you have them in your which they're voted into record, which is weird, because you can't vote statutorily on

1136
02:03:28,725 --> 02:03:34,587
[SPEAKER_04]: something that you can watch and pretty much be a part of by watching it, but you can vote.

1137
02:03:34,667 --> 02:03:34,947
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1138
02:03:35,467 --> 02:03:36,447
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1139
02:03:36,508 --> 02:03:37,408
[SPEAKER_03]: It's meeting minutes.

1140
02:03:37,728 --> 02:03:39,248
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a public hearing.

1141
02:03:39,268 --> 02:03:40,229
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1142
02:03:40,329 --> 02:03:42,489
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was weird, but I said, all right.

1143
02:03:43,270 --> 02:03:51,492
[SPEAKER_12]: And just to confirm, it's okay that Pam and Sally weren't actually on the board at this time in June.

1144
02:03:52,493 --> 02:03:52,953
[SPEAKER_12]: They weren't?

1145
02:03:53,393 --> 02:03:53,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Were not?

1146
02:03:54,553 --> 02:03:55,193
[SPEAKER_12]: They were not.

1147
02:03:55,654 --> 02:03:55,974
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1148
02:03:56,194 --> 02:03:56,674
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't think so.

1149
02:03:57,284 --> 02:04:02,486
[SPEAKER_12]: And Danielle just confirming if it's okay for them to vote if they weren't on the board.

1150
02:04:04,546 --> 02:04:13,009
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, worst thing is that the vote is void and you need to wait next week or the next meeting.

1151
02:04:14,490 --> 02:04:16,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was the question that I had.

1152
02:04:16,830 --> 02:04:24,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so much there, again, the nuance of the word absence, not so much that they were absent from the meeting, but that they were not even

1153
02:04:25,787 --> 02:04:27,848
[SPEAKER_04]: a part of the board at the time of the meeting?

1154
02:04:28,649 --> 02:04:30,089
[SPEAKER_04]: That's for public hearings.

1155
02:04:31,550 --> 02:04:35,833
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I mean, I was just meaning, can they still vote?

1156
02:04:38,734 --> 02:04:39,675
[SPEAKER_02]: On the meeting minutes.

1157
02:04:40,175 --> 02:04:40,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1158
02:04:42,256 --> 02:04:47,279
[SPEAKER_03]: Meeting minutes are just like a very ministerial thing.

1159
02:04:47,840 --> 02:04:50,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1160
02:04:50,781 --> 02:04:52,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Ideally, the minutes are accurate.

1161
02:04:54,202 --> 02:04:56,563
[SPEAKER_03]: We're accepting meeting minutes that are accurate.

1162
02:04:57,103 --> 02:05:04,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So members can rely on the other members who say that they are.

1163
02:05:06,347 --> 02:05:07,148
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very strange.

1164
02:05:08,709 --> 02:05:09,669
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very strange.

1165
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:17,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why, but we could, can we pass it with two votes or should we just wait till next week?

1166
02:05:19,226 --> 02:05:22,328
[SPEAKER_04]: No, if you're absolutely sure that we can, we don't have to hold it over.

1167
02:05:22,348 --> 02:05:31,254
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm okay with vote, and I just thought maybe it's after we accepted it, and maybe Emily and Peter came back and said, oh, wait, that's not what it said.

1168
02:05:31,314 --> 02:05:32,975
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we rectify that?

1169
02:05:33,355 --> 02:05:34,076
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we go back?

1170
02:05:36,858 --> 02:05:37,998
[SPEAKER_04]: You could amend them, I guess.

1171
02:05:38,419 --> 02:05:39,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you could amend them.

1172
02:05:39,339 --> 02:05:39,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1173
02:05:39,720 --> 02:05:41,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then if there's a way forward, then I don't see

1174
02:05:43,173 --> 02:05:44,774
[SPEAKER_04]: what these are June minutes.

1175
02:05:45,455 --> 02:06:02,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I would, I would recommend if we and I think we're, I think we're okay to I would recommend voting tonight because there's like a so you have to record you have to vote on or approve minutes from like, I think you have three meetings basically to do that.

1176
02:06:03,010 --> 02:06:04,492
[SPEAKER_12]: So this would be the third meeting.

1177
02:06:06,473 --> 02:06:06,934
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think

1178
02:06:09,045 --> 02:06:11,127
[SPEAKER_12]: to kind of keep pace with that.

1179
02:06:12,107 --> 02:06:17,692
[SPEAKER_12]: If folks felt comfortable voting tonight, then I would recommend doing so.

1180
02:06:17,712 --> 02:06:19,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1181
02:06:19,753 --> 02:06:21,255
[SPEAKER_03]: You could just vote to accept the minutes.

1182
02:06:21,755 --> 02:06:23,556
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it is, accepting the minutes.

1183
02:06:23,777 --> 02:06:26,058
[SPEAKER_03]: We say approve, but it's just accepting.

1184
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:32,043
[SPEAKER_04]: So at this time, I'll ask for a motion to accept the minute means from 6-7-23.

1185
02:06:32,103 --> 02:06:32,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I so move.

1186
02:06:38,799 --> 02:06:39,419
[SPEAKER_04]: And a second.

1187
02:06:40,680 --> 02:06:41,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Second.

1188
02:06:41,080 --> 02:06:45,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we'll call Ari Fishman.

1189
02:06:46,543 --> 02:06:46,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1190
02:06:47,764 --> 02:06:49,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Pam Marianski.

1191
02:06:49,625 --> 02:06:49,845
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1192
02:06:50,566 --> 02:06:51,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Sally Akiki.

1193
02:06:52,447 --> 02:06:52,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1194
02:06:53,567 --> 02:06:55,909
[SPEAKER_04]: And myself, Jackie McPherson, I'm a yes.

1195
02:06:58,010 --> 02:06:59,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So miscellaneous and other updates.

1196
02:06:59,851 --> 02:07:07,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Does the city have anything, Amanda or Daniel, do you have anything that you want to announce at this time or share?

1197
02:07:08,130 --> 02:07:08,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

1198
02:07:08,530 --> 02:07:11,632
[SPEAKER_12]: And I promise to be quick.

1199
02:07:11,652 --> 02:07:17,796
[SPEAKER_12]: So we will be having our next meeting on August 16th, third Wednesday of the month.

1200
02:07:18,377 --> 02:07:20,658
[SPEAKER_12]: And there are a couple of items on that agenda.

1201
02:07:21,378 --> 02:07:23,200
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, a couple of a couple of them already.

1202
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:28,163
[SPEAKER_12]: So the zoning amendments will be a part of that meeting.

1203
02:07:28,463 --> 02:07:33,746
[SPEAKER_12]: The H Mart site plan review is planned for that night as well.

1204
02:07:34,647 --> 02:07:34,807
[SPEAKER_12]: And

1205
02:07:37,673 --> 02:07:38,313
[SPEAKER_12]: and notes here.

1206
02:07:39,334 --> 02:07:50,817
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're expecting that the special permit discourse on the Bank of America proposal at 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway will be that night as well.

1207
02:07:52,498 --> 02:07:58,319
[SPEAKER_12]: So just wanted to kind of give you guys a little teaser trailer of what to expect that evening.

1208
02:08:00,600 --> 02:08:05,842
[SPEAKER_12]: And other than that, we do have a new member who will be joining the board.

1209
02:08:07,598 --> 02:08:10,059
[SPEAKER_12]: His name, oh, I should have written it down.

1210
02:08:11,419 --> 02:08:12,219
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me one moment.

1211
02:08:13,379 --> 02:08:14,099
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Sharad.

1212
02:08:14,199 --> 02:08:18,600
[SPEAKER_12]: Sharad Bajracharya will be joining us.

1213
02:08:18,660 --> 02:08:20,221
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're excited to welcome him.

1214
02:08:20,721 --> 02:08:25,662
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's all I have.

1215
02:08:26,642 --> 02:08:27,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Danielle, anything else?

1216
02:08:27,582 --> 02:08:32,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's all I have right now.

1217
02:08:38,147 --> 02:08:57,095
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank all of you for being patient with me on these PDDs because they're pretty much new to the city, and I can't get my head wrapped around the fact that we're still in the zone amendment, especially with all the legalese that's going behind it and with the absence of like a city solicitor that you can just reach out and be like, okay, what's going on and things like that.

1218
02:08:57,175 --> 02:09:01,777
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys have done an amazing job at the city staff on

1219
02:09:03,725 --> 02:09:05,245
[SPEAKER_04]: just getting it to where it's at.

1220
02:09:05,325 --> 02:09:12,047
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, I'm just, I'm at that point myself as one board member, I'm ready to dive into the site plan.

1221
02:09:12,087 --> 02:09:13,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is, it's a little difficult.

1222
02:09:13,827 --> 02:09:17,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's even more difficult to like lead the board and what we're supposed to do.

1223
02:09:17,908 --> 02:09:20,349
[SPEAKER_04]: So to get to that point.

1224
02:09:20,469 --> 02:09:28,931
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate all of your help on that again, because I felt like a fish out of water really with the PDDs again, being new at it.

1225
02:09:28,951 --> 02:09:29,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yes.

1226
02:09:33,005 --> 02:09:36,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I know I will work with all of you.

1227
02:09:36,628 --> 02:09:39,911
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate that.

1228
02:09:39,931 --> 02:09:48,318
[SPEAKER_04]: And one other thing I wanted to ask, I wanted to make sure that I'm pronouncing names properly outside of getting Irie's last name proper.

1229
02:09:49,339 --> 02:09:50,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Pam Marianski.

1230
02:09:51,321 --> 02:09:51,841
[SPEAKER_04]: Am I saying it?

1231
02:09:52,902 --> 02:09:54,063
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I mean, it's super close.

1232
02:09:54,143 --> 02:09:56,625
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just like the name Maryam.

1233
02:09:57,086 --> 02:09:57,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Maryanski.

1234
02:09:58,167 --> 02:09:58,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Maryanski?

1235
02:09:59,147 --> 02:09:59,548
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1236
02:09:59,948 --> 02:10:00,509
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how I say it.

1237
02:10:01,782 --> 02:10:04,904
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Sally, am I saying it proper?

1238
02:10:04,924 --> 02:10:05,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1239
02:10:05,804 --> 02:10:06,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1240
02:10:06,085 --> 02:10:06,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1241
02:10:06,825 --> 02:10:07,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1242
02:10:07,365 --> 02:10:13,789
[SPEAKER_04]: I just I don't know the last meeting I kept saying to myself like I should have asked but and so I asked.

1243
02:10:15,778 --> 02:10:16,539
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't have anything.

1244
02:10:16,559 --> 02:10:18,040
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting your name wrong too.

1245
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:18,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Has it changed?

1246
02:10:19,041 --> 02:10:21,823
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's okay.

1247
02:10:22,163 --> 02:10:24,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't tell my husband that, even though he's close.

1248
02:10:24,545 --> 02:10:26,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I still answer to Furtado.

1249
02:10:26,387 --> 02:10:28,569
[SPEAKER_04]: That's who I've been for nearly 50 years.

1250
02:10:28,869 --> 02:10:33,953
[SPEAKER_04]: So I forget that I'm embarrassing myself at times.

1251
02:10:39,538 --> 02:10:40,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's all I have.

1252
02:10:40,699 --> 02:10:44,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want someone to make a motion?

1253
02:10:44,975 --> 02:10:50,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so if there's nothing else, does someone want to make a motion to adjourn?

1254
02:10:53,439 --> 02:10:53,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion.

1255
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:56,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Second.

1256
02:11:00,622 --> 02:11:02,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, no one wants to leave.

1257
02:11:03,004 --> 02:11:03,284
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1258
02:11:03,504 --> 02:11:05,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to stay all night.

1259
02:11:07,926 --> 02:11:08,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Ari Fishman?

1260
02:11:09,907 --> 02:11:11,207
[SPEAKER_16]: Enthusiastic, yes.

1261
02:11:11,388 --> 02:11:14,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Pam Marianski?

1262
02:11:14,655 --> 02:11:14,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1263
02:11:15,816 --> 02:11:16,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Sally Akiki.

1264
02:11:17,377 --> 02:11:17,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1265
02:11:18,438 --> 02:11:19,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jackie McPherson.

1266
02:11:19,759 --> 02:11:20,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1267
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:22,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everyone and have a great night.

1268
02:11:22,662 --> 02:11:24,363
[SPEAKER_04]: See you on August 16th.

1269
02:11:24,903 --> 02:11:25,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you everyone.
