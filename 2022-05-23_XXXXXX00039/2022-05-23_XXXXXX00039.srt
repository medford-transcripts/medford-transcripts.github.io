1
00:00:02,838 --> 00:00:04,200
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, hey Medford Bites listeners.

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:15,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Today in the introduction, I have Dave McKenna here with me, and he's going to give us a little bit of information about the recent complaint against the Medford Police Department.

3
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:16,833
[SPEAKER_02]: So Dave, I'll hand it over to you.

4
00:00:18,175 --> 00:00:18,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Danielle.

5
00:00:19,776 --> 00:00:22,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so a story broke a couple weeks ago that

6
00:00:24,317 --> 00:00:50,832
[SPEAKER_00]: The Medford police, according to the complaint last year, stopped two recent Medford High graduates, two teenagers in the Winthrop Street Rotary, and gave them no explanation, pointed guns at them, asked them to get out of the car, handcuffed them, held them at gunpoint, searched the car, found nothing, and then let them go on their way.

7
00:00:52,337 --> 00:01:04,969
[SPEAKER_00]: This was really upsetting for the teens in the complaint, they say that they tried to get a copy of the police report to figure out what could have led to this and they were told that there was no police report.

8
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:06,931
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not given a copy of it.

9
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:13,537
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that is alleged in the complaint and just really upsetting to hear about.

10
00:01:15,272 --> 00:01:26,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and what was striking about that report too was the, I think the number of times they talked about how they were complying with what the police were asking them to do and still were treated pretty unfairly, it sounds like.

11
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,944
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm curious, I think there's been a post on Facebook about a letter that folks can sign.

12
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:41,448
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could talk a little bit about how we could be involved or what efforts we can have to sort of advocate for.

13
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, great.

14
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,393
[SPEAKER_00]: So a number of groups came together to draft a letter to the mayor about how we can do better.

15
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:57,857
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, a lot of us sent individual emails to the mayor and we got a response that they're investigating if procedure was followed.

16
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:11,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, and to the groups that have signed the letter, the Mystic Valley NAACP, Mobilize Medford, Our Revolution Medford, Safe Medford, the question is not, was procedure followed?

17
00:02:12,108 --> 00:02:14,769
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is, what do we want public safety to look like in Medford?

18
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,849
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that is what the letter is about.

19
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:21,490
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are asking for people to co-sign the letter.

20
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:24,131
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a version available online.

21
00:02:24,151 --> 00:02:26,892
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess you can share the link with your listeners.

22
00:02:29,128 --> 00:02:32,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we think this is an opportunity for Medford to do better.

23
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:33,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Dave.

24
00:02:33,895 --> 00:02:37,557
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and we hope to have some follow up on this in the future.

25
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:44,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And we will put, I will put some of those links in our show notes so people can sign the letter or have a look at it and decide if they want to sign it.

26
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:56,168
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rest of our episode today is an interview with Milva McDonald, where we talk about charter review, which is something that's come up a lot when we talk to the different municipal candidates.

27
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:02,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I hope you enjoy and please, thanks Dave for joining me today.

28
00:03:02,772 --> 00:03:04,993
[SPEAKER_02]: and hopefully we'll talk more about this soon.

29
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:11,675
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thank you so much for joining me today.

30
00:03:12,135 --> 00:03:17,176
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't mind starting by introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

31
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:18,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

32
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:19,157
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Danielle.

33
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:21,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited to talk with you today.

34
00:03:21,177 --> 00:03:22,958
[SPEAKER_05]: My name's Milva McDonald.

35
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I've lived in Medford for almost three decades now.

36
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Raised my kids here and

37
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:38,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Lately, I've been working on charter review, which has been talked about for many of the years that I've lived here.

38
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:43,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And a group of residents and I are trying to get it to happen.

39
00:03:44,146 --> 00:03:45,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And could you just tell us your pronouns?

40
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thanks.

41
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:48,482
[SPEAKER_05]: It's she her.

42
00:03:49,082 --> 00:03:49,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

43
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:56,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that's something that I heard about a lot when I was starting this podcast and interviewing candidates for the municipal election.

44
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:58,729
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the first time that I'd ever heard about about it.

45
00:03:58,789 --> 00:04:07,596
[SPEAKER_02]: But before we kind of dig into that, I'll ask you the question that I asked everybody that I talked to on the podcast, which is, what is your favorite place to eat in Medford?

46
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:08,777
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you like to eat there?

47
00:04:10,669 --> 00:04:15,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think I'm going to give a shout out to a couple of bakeries.

48
00:04:15,313 --> 00:04:15,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Colette.

49
00:04:15,934 --> 00:04:16,914
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like Colette.

50
00:04:16,954 --> 00:04:21,499
[SPEAKER_05]: I like their pastries and Goldilocks bagels.

51
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,162
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's some solid breakfast choices.

52
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:26,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

53
00:04:27,344 --> 00:04:27,844
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you.

54
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:29,786
[SPEAKER_02]: So you mentioned Charter Review.

55
00:04:29,826 --> 00:04:33,790
[SPEAKER_02]: So could you just tell us what Charter Review is?

56
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:36,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, charter review.

57
00:04:37,066 --> 00:04:46,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So the charter of a city or town is often people will compare it to the Constitution of the city or town, it just sort of lays out the form of government.

58
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:50,417
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a form of government in Medford called Plan A, and it was adopted in 1986.

59
00:04:50,517 --> 00:04:55,360
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's known as strong mayor.

60
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,163
[SPEAKER_05]: So it means that we have a mayor and a city council.

61
00:05:00,064 --> 00:05:00,164
[SPEAKER_05]: And

62
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:13,436
[SPEAKER_05]: So the charter just sort of lays that out how many city Councilors we have the terms of office, what to do if one of them resigns or can't serve anymore.

63
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:17,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a lot of things like that and also the school committee.

64
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:19,096
[SPEAKER_05]: the composition of the school committee.

65
00:05:19,116 --> 00:05:27,283
[SPEAKER_05]: So just sort of the basic form of government, how it operates, whether there are term limits, things like that.

66
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,365
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor is the head of the school committee.

67
00:05:31,006 --> 00:05:32,867
[SPEAKER_05]: All those things are laid out in the charter.

68
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:40,029
[SPEAKER_02]: And including how, like how and where we elect school committee and city council members.

69
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:44,330
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now we have like an at large, it's at large for both of those committees.

70
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,870
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely, yeah.

71
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether we don't have board representation, which is actually unusual for a city of our size.

72
00:05:51,872 --> 00:05:56,033
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, that's something that could be looked at in a charter review.

73
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:07,915
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what that would mean is that when you run for either of those, um, school committee or city council, you'd be running for like a specific part of the city rather than the whole city.

74
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:09,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

75
00:06:09,196 --> 00:06:14,538
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's eight wards and, um, if let's, let's say the, the.

76
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:20,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Charter got reviewed and ward representation was implemented for the city council.

77
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:24,043
[SPEAKER_05]: It could mean that you'd have eight.

78
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:33,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Ward representatives and then a certain number of at-large or maybe the wards would be maybe a council would run for two wards.

79
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:43,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these are all things that a charter review committee or commission would closely look at to determine, you know, what might work best for Medford.

80
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:56,689
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing about at large, one of the things about at large is that it makes it harder for people to run for office in some ways, because it takes a lot more resources.

81
00:06:58,671 --> 00:07:04,275
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you have to come up with the money and the time to campaign all over the city.

82
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:08,618
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other issue is that some people

83
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:17,948
[SPEAKER_05]: feel underrepresented because they don't have a Councilor that's from their ward, even though all the Councilors are at large and they represent the entire city.

84
00:07:17,968 --> 00:07:23,674
[SPEAKER_05]: There's maybe certain awards that have had much less representation over the years.

85
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:29,541
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that that is definitely an issue that people are interested in exploring.

86
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:39,131
[SPEAKER_02]: I could also see why, because I live in Fulton Heights, and I think a lot of elected officials also live in Fulton Heights.

87
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:52,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I could see why there could be some resistance in the voting for the charter review, if it were to include changing toward representation from those committees, because that could mean fewer of them would be able to be elected.

88
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:58,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, it could, or maybe not.

89
00:07:58,254 --> 00:08:01,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and the other thing with the charter review is,

90
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:04,564
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't, I mean, it would be looked at, but we don't know.

91
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:08,007
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not, it doesn't guarantee that we would have board representation.

92
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:12,070
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely one of the pieces that would be looked at.

93
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:31,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, and whatever group does review the charter is gonna look at other communities, you know, actual data and just, you know, information that will really help them determine what's best for Medford.

94
00:08:31,622 --> 00:08:31,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm hmm.

95
00:08:32,482 --> 00:08:40,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think that idea of having folks, you know, being able to focus on a ward rather than the whole city is, it sounds really helpful.

96
00:08:41,926 --> 00:08:44,827
[SPEAKER_02]: It also sounds like it's not a guarantee with the with charter review.

97
00:08:46,408 --> 00:08:55,872
[SPEAKER_02]: But it feels like having gone to some of the city council meetings where they talk about it, that feels like a piece that is meeting some resistance from some of the city council.

98
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:19,251
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, well, it was specifically mentioned at one of the recently the mayor put forth a home rule petition to ask the city council to vote on putting electing a charter commission to review the charter charter review the commission and be voted for three.

99
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:25,570
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's probably not enough to get it over the hurdle at the state house so our group is looking for other ways now.

100
00:09:26,191 --> 00:09:41,277
[SPEAKER_05]: But during those meetings there was ward representation was specifically mentioned by one of the Councilors as a concern and part of the reason for that was because a different Councilor had asked for ward representation to be

101
00:09:42,042 --> 00:09:47,746
[SPEAKER_05]: part of the elected charter review commission that the mayor was trying to get going.

102
00:09:48,406 --> 00:09:49,287
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.

103
00:09:50,788 --> 00:09:58,633
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and, uh, you know, there were, there weren't big discussions about it, but yeah, there definitely was one Councilor who expressed concern about it.

104
00:09:59,093 --> 00:10:00,134
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a confusing piece.

105
00:10:00,154 --> 00:10:09,400
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's the difference between the home rule petition and actually voting on charter review are two separate things, but it seems like in some of those conversations, it got a little muddled.

106
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:09,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

107
00:10:10,835 --> 00:10:12,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's the whole it.

108
00:10:12,776 --> 00:10:13,156
[SPEAKER_05]: It is.

109
00:10:13,876 --> 00:10:18,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's definitely complex and right now, our group.

110
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:23,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I've learned a lot myself in the last few months we've only been meeting for a few months and we're all learning as we go.

111
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:46,429
[SPEAKER_05]: right now we're just in the process of trying to get the charter review to happen and there's a certain level of frustration that it's so difficult to do that because it seems you know it seems sort of like a given um gee yeah let's look at it let's review it the the review process however it unfolds is going to take

112
00:10:47,249 --> 00:11:02,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Time and then, and the voters will be involved and no changes, you know, any changes that that are proposed will not happen quickly so it's not like a radical or, you know, rushed idea to.

113
00:11:05,658 --> 00:11:10,522
[SPEAKER_05]: to have voted on this home rule petition or to get it going.

114
00:11:10,602 --> 00:11:12,064
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's going to take a lot of time.

115
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:16,848
[SPEAKER_05]: So the fact that it's taking so much time just to get to the review is kind of a little frustrating.

116
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:22,493
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're really committed and we're going to make it happen one way or the other.

117
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:26,436
[SPEAKER_05]: There's two ways to do it.

118
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:38,358
[SPEAKER_05]: The way that Medford has tried to do it is kind of a different way from the, like, if you look at sort of, if you Google charter review in Massachusetts, you'll find documents that say, well, there's two routes to charter change.

119
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:42,781
[SPEAKER_05]: And the route that Medford took was actually sort of a hybrid of those two.

120
00:11:43,522 --> 00:11:54,069
[SPEAKER_05]: So one is outlined in Massachusetts general law, chapter 43B, and it involves collecting signatures from 15% of registered voters in the city.

121
00:11:55,050 --> 00:12:03,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the question of once that's done the question of whether to review the charter and candidates for an elected commission bow on the ballot.

122
00:12:04,853 --> 00:12:11,635
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the next municipal election, which in our case would be 2023 and then that commission works for 18 months.

123
00:12:14,606 --> 00:12:18,708
[SPEAKER_05]: the changes they propose, if any, then go to the voters.

124
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:31,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's, you know, we're talking at that, with this process, assuming that we collected all the signatures, we would have a new, potentially have a charter changes on the ballot in 2025.

125
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:42,218
[SPEAKER_05]: So the other way is to do it through, it's called the special act, and that kind of charter is called a home rule charter.

126
00:12:42,498 --> 00:12:43,639
[SPEAKER_05]: A special act charter,

127
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:49,610
[SPEAKER_05]: basically just goes through the city council as a home rule petition.

128
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:59,397
[SPEAKER_05]: So most cities in town to do that, they form a committee, the committee reviews the charter, takes as long as they need to.

129
00:12:59,598 --> 00:13:07,263
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's many cities and towns, most of them probably do it this way because the burden of collecting the signatures is pretty high.

130
00:13:08,964 --> 00:13:12,967
[SPEAKER_05]: So this committee takes however long they need to take.

131
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:29,068
[SPEAKER_05]: example of a community community that's doing that right now is Somerville, and they have, you know, clearly, it's a process that can involve a lot of public participation in there in their case, there's tons of public participation.

132
00:13:29,088 --> 00:13:34,510
[SPEAKER_05]: They're constantly communicating they're constantly trying to get people involved to hear what

133
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:47,756
[SPEAKER_05]: What kinds of things, you know the community wants, and then when they propose their changes they go through mayor and the city council and then they go through the state house, and then most likely to go on the ballot so.

134
00:13:49,156 --> 00:13:53,238
[SPEAKER_05]: So what Medford did with that home real petition was took.

135
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:57,542
[SPEAKER_05]: portion of Chapter 43B and made it into a Home Rule petition.

136
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,965
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was kind of a mix.

137
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:06,490
[SPEAKER_05]: It was like, we're going to try to elect the commission without collecting the signatures and doing it through a Home Rule petition instead.

138
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:08,752
[SPEAKER_05]: But it hasn't worked.

139
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:11,595
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're pursuing these other avenues now.

140
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:12,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

141
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:21,783
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that would mean, so the way that you're describing that Somerville is doing this is like they, they come up with the proposed changes and then go to city council, then the mayor, then the state house.

142
00:14:22,263 --> 00:14:27,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'd heard was the voting in city council then goes to the state house.

143
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:31,447
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then you can start that process of proposing changes to the charter.

144
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:38,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they, the, basically it goes to the city council as sort of amendments to the charter.

145
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And, um, and then that.

146
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:49,613
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it sort of becomes, it's a home rule petition and then it goes and becomes a piece of legislation so a home rule petition becomes a piece of legislation at the State House.

147
00:14:51,937 --> 00:15:02,905
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, part of what I've done in trying to understand all this is I'll go to the Massachusetts legislature website and just search charter review.

148
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:07,209
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see there's any number of bills from different communities.

149
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:16,135
[SPEAKER_05]: And they all have different things in them, but like amendments, you know, it's the language of whatever they want their new charter to be.

150
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:18,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they have gone through the process of

151
00:15:21,081 --> 00:15:32,745
[SPEAKER_05]: however they came up with those amendments, whether they had a committee of residents doing it, or then it's gone through the city government and then it goes to the state house and then they vote on it.

152
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:45,589
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not in the law that it has to go back to the voters of the community, but when there's significant changes, generally the state wants the people of the community to vote on it.

153
00:15:45,729 --> 00:15:50,331
[SPEAKER_05]: So any significant changes most often either whether

154
00:15:51,706 --> 00:15:57,290
[SPEAKER_05]: whether you use the signature route or the special act route, go back to the voters to vote on.

155
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:57,910
Yeah.

156
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,273
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like we need like a snappy schoolhouse rock song to describe charter.

157
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:03,173
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

158
00:16:03,454 --> 00:16:05,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Or as my husband keeps saying, well, you need a flow chart.

159
00:16:06,195 --> 00:16:08,737
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, I said, yeah, we do need a flow chart.

160
00:16:09,518 --> 00:16:15,842
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the, one of the issues in Medford is that we, we still don't exactly know which route we're taking.

161
00:16:16,836 --> 00:16:22,698
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, we don't know, you know, our group is like, we say we're, um, we're doing parallel tracks.

162
00:16:22,818 --> 00:16:27,260
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working on, we're laying the groundwork to collect those signatures if we need to do it.

163
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,643
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but we're also trying to work with the mayor's office to see if we can get a committee going.

164
00:16:35,023 --> 00:16:36,844
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're kind of doing both.

165
00:16:37,384 --> 00:16:42,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so that, uh, cause, cause we were gonna, we're gonna get this one way or the other.

166
00:16:43,366 --> 00:16:45,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but, uh,

167
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:54,140
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, once we know which route we're taking, it will be much easier to talk about it, because then we'll just sort of be ready to go.

168
00:16:54,381 --> 00:16:56,824
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, we're just trying to get it going.

169
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:05,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and hearing about the timeline, that's something that I didn't really know a lot about before you kind of laid that out.

170
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:11,328
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does seem particularly frustrating that you've been at this for a long time.

171
00:17:11,368 --> 00:17:15,830
[SPEAKER_02]: The charter hasn't been reviewed, right, for maybe longer than you've lived here, is that right?

172
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, absolutely.

173
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:18,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

174
00:17:18,852 --> 00:17:22,194
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like there's support from residents across the board, right?

175
00:17:22,234 --> 00:17:26,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's no sort of like political alliance around charter review.

176
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:27,177
[SPEAKER_05]: It does.

177
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,080
[SPEAKER_05]: HAB-Charlotte Pitts, COB.:

178
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,844
[SPEAKER_05]: : Think there is no I mean our group, you know, I mean I HAB-Charlotte Pitts, COB.:

179
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:34,888
[SPEAKER_05]: : There are people from all over the city.

180
00:17:35,568 --> 00:17:44,700
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not, you know, I mean, it's, it's actually kind of awesome, you know, to to get together with other residents and get to know neighbors and

181
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:53,713
[SPEAKER_05]: I've worked on and off in different groups in Medford, but this group, it's really, and everybody's kind of there for the same reason.

182
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:56,076
[SPEAKER_05]: We're like, we really want charter review to happen.

183
00:17:56,156 --> 00:17:57,497
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we're working on.

184
00:17:58,438 --> 00:17:59,820
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the sole agenda.

185
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:04,064
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, it's great.

186
00:18:05,548 --> 00:18:19,297
[SPEAKER_02]: And it sounds like the 4-3 vote in the city council historically hasn't been enough for the state house to say, well, you can advance this to try to- Yeah, the state house has wanted a super majority.

187
00:18:20,217 --> 00:18:23,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's three times the council has voted that same way.

188
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,722
[SPEAKER_05]: This current council has voted that way twice.

189
00:18:26,882 --> 00:18:29,643
[SPEAKER_05]: And the council before this council also was 4-3.

190
00:18:31,871 --> 00:18:47,116
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, that was also particularly frustrating for us because one of the first things our group did, because we knew that homeowner petition existed, was we reached out to all the city councilors and we tried to have meetings with the councilors who had voted no last time.

191
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:51,137
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were able to meet with two of them.

192
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:52,778
[SPEAKER_05]: One of them just didn't respond to us.

193
00:18:54,564 --> 00:18:57,166
[SPEAKER_05]: And they were both really supportive.

194
00:18:57,527 --> 00:19:04,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, the ward, one of them said, I really want word representation on this commission.

195
00:19:04,152 --> 00:19:08,775
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we contacted the mayor, we got that into the home rule petition.

196
00:19:08,795 --> 00:19:22,106
[SPEAKER_05]: And we felt really, really positive about those conversations and about the support that the Councilors, I mean, we, our intention going into those meetings was

197
00:19:22,734 --> 00:19:24,235
[SPEAKER_05]: let's hear what their concerns are.

198
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:32,739
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we heard was that their concerns were about representation and then we were able to address them, which felt great.

199
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And they both expressed support and then they changed their minds.

200
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:45,586
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was tough, it's hard, but we're moving forward.

201
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:49,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And can you write us the name of the group that's working to advance strategy?

202
00:19:51,075 --> 00:19:58,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we're the Medford Charter Review Coalition, and we do have a website, medfordcharterreview.org.

203
00:20:00,118 --> 00:20:18,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I consider us to be sort of an ad hoc group that we've come, I mean, this particular group has come together, I think it was like December or January, January, I think, but I don't wanna take away from the fact that people have been working on charter review in Medford for many years.

204
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:19,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Jim Silva,

205
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:22,223
[SPEAKER_05]: a big part of the group now.

206
00:20:22,543 --> 00:20:25,684
[SPEAKER_05]: He has been working on it for a long time.

207
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:40,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael Ruggiero, who actually has since moved out of the city, but he worked on it for a long time and they undertook the Herculean task of the signature collecting and actually got close to 5,000.

208
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:51,364
[SPEAKER_05]: So, you know, I mean, right now our estimate is that we'd have to get about 7,000 signatures.

209
00:20:52,264 --> 00:20:55,665
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, 15% is just under that, but you kind of need a pad.

210
00:20:56,446 --> 00:21:09,752
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and, you know, so they came and it would have been fewer when they were doing it, because they were, you know, it's probably the, there were fewer registered voters, but they came really close.

211
00:21:11,631 --> 00:21:21,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, you know, that just sort of is a testament to how many people want it and the amount of work that people have put into it.

212
00:21:23,097 --> 00:21:39,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And what do you think, so, I mean, it's, I, I heard Carter, have you kind of described one says like, or like, you know, kind of compared to how you go for like a yearly physical or like, you know, there's different things you have check in on your health and that this sort of, yeah, being this for being kind of related to like the health of the city.

213
00:21:40,547 --> 00:21:44,630
[SPEAKER_02]: But what do you think, like, how would you describe the importance of charter of you?

214
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:48,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like it's fundamental.

215
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:57,458
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, and I've felt this way for a while because I, you know, I hear so many people talking about issues that they're concerned about.

216
00:21:57,698 --> 00:22:01,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always think, you know, charter review could make a difference with that.

217
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:06,001
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in particular representation, people are concerned about representation.

218
00:22:06,801 --> 00:22:08,902
[SPEAKER_05]: Charter review could make a big difference with that.

219
00:22:10,782 --> 00:22:12,803
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I hear people talking about

220
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:22,918
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's, you know, I, I don't have an opinion on this because I haven't looked at the details or I haven't really looked at it closely but some people say well the mayor.

221
00:22:23,922 --> 00:22:29,085
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if the mayor wasn't the head of the school committee, then it would be better for the school committee.

222
00:22:29,105 --> 00:22:30,386
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be better for the mayor.

223
00:22:30,406 --> 00:22:37,770
[SPEAKER_05]: I, like I said, I don't know, cause I haven't looked at it, but that's an issue that would have to be looked at through charter review.

224
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:41,952
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear people saying, you know, what about term limits?

225
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:47,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we had a mayor in office, I think for, was it 28 years or something like that?

226
00:22:49,176 --> 00:22:51,397
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Councilors in there for decades.

227
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:52,678
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean,

228
00:22:53,680 --> 00:23:05,031
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't, again, I don't know, because I haven't really looked, I don't have an opinion really on, a strong opinion on any of these issues because I haven't looked at them closely enough.

229
00:23:06,892 --> 00:23:13,218
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think, I do have enough of an opinion to say, yeah, that's definitely something we should look at.

230
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:18,623
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only way to look at those really and to make a change is through a charter review.

231
00:23:20,267 --> 00:23:45,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and you know that when you talked about the relationship between the mayor and the school committee and term limits and length of term right like that when when these folks have a two-year term half of their term is spent sort of trying to get re-elected right and exactly that's definitely another one of the things I hear people say two years is too short for the mayor because they're constantly campaigning so

232
00:23:46,642 --> 00:23:49,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've heard that many times over the years.

233
00:23:49,584 --> 00:23:53,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's, again, comes back to charter review.

234
00:23:55,328 --> 00:24:02,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an option in reviewing the charter to put something in the charter about its own review, like a time limit on when you can do that?

235
00:24:02,994 --> 00:24:05,016
[SPEAKER_05]: That's absolutely that.

236
00:24:05,196 --> 00:24:13,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And many other communities have provisions in their charter that say the charter will be reviewed every 10 years or every eight years or whatever.

237
00:24:14,323 --> 00:24:14,683
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's

238
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:26,660
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely something that people are interested in doing so that every decade or whatever is decided when the committee or commission looks at the data.

239
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,963
[SPEAKER_05]: So this doesn't have to happen again.

240
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:34,486
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to go and try to fight to review our city government.

241
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:40,672
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, because it's starting to feel like, yeah, we have to fight for this, which,

242
00:24:42,242 --> 00:24:43,703
[SPEAKER_05]: astonishes me.

243
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:58,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I heard a comment at one of the city council meetings about like this, this being sort of like a threat to our democracy, like how do we keep being able to have a say and like, you know, the power of sort of the voice of the residents versus the politician?

244
00:24:59,676 --> 00:25:02,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, I yeah.

245
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:04,419
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.

246
00:25:04,439 --> 00:25:05,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree with that.

247
00:25:07,008 --> 00:25:12,372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and so your group meets about once a month over Zoom?

248
00:25:12,392 --> 00:25:17,776
[SPEAKER_05]: We meet once a month, and we will sometimes have smaller groups or meeting.

249
00:25:17,876 --> 00:25:25,682
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's subcommittees, but everybody is invited to them kind of every two weeks, in the middle of the month, we might do that.

250
00:25:25,802 --> 00:25:36,531
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have something, like recently, while we were making brochures, things like that, getting the website up and running,

251
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:47,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to get plan out the game plan for the signature drive if we ultimately have to do that, talk about you know how we're going to approach the mayor.

252
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:52,448
[SPEAKER_05]: So, so if we have something pressing then we'll, we'll add an extra meeting.

253
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:58,692
[SPEAKER_02]: And other than attending those meetings, what are ways that folks can get involved or support the work that you're doing.

254
00:26:00,387 --> 00:26:09,876
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely check out the website, because the website sort of it's it talks about the group, but there's also a resources section where people can look at.

255
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:14,420
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think looking at what other communities have done and are doing is really helpful.

256
00:26:15,661 --> 00:26:20,265
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, if anybody sort of interested in, you know, I mean,

257
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:27,187
[SPEAKER_05]: the details about how charter review works or how it happens, we have resources on our website.

258
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:33,009
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would say just learning about charter review is a great way to get involved.

259
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:40,091
[SPEAKER_05]: And the meetings are open to anybody in Medford, so come to a meeting.

260
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:46,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we collect signatures, we'll be looking for volunteers for that.

261
00:26:47,652 --> 00:26:50,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And the more people that get educated and get involved

262
00:26:51,382 --> 00:27:02,132
[SPEAKER_05]: the more they can interact with the committee or commission and perhaps even decide to be on or to try to apply to be on a committee or to run for the commission.

263
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:10,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we do need, I mean, we do need representation on whatever committee or commission that's up and running.

264
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,823
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, so those are some ways.

265
00:27:15,795 --> 00:27:28,743
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if there were to be that commission, like those elected folks to look at the charter, would those have to be people that aren't already elected to other positions or is it just, could it be a combination of both?

266
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:41,471
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a question that has been asked and I haven't been able to get the definitive answer, but the answer that most people I've asked seem to think that it's not,

267
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:46,569
[SPEAKER_05]: limited that anybody can run for those positions, even people who are already elected to office.

268
00:27:46,949 --> 00:27:52,992
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that they would, but you know, it would be a process of running for office.

269
00:27:54,313 --> 00:28:04,898
[SPEAKER_05]: It would mean that the people would have to collect signatures to get on the ballot, you know, nomination papers, and I mean, I don't know how many people

270
00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:15,376
[SPEAKER_05]: ever run for officer know what's involved, but you have to get you have to get signatures, get on the ballot, and then you get on the ballot, and then you have to campaign, you have to get your name out somehow.

271
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:19,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and this is, you know, completely volunteer position.

272
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:25,065
[SPEAKER_05]: So, again, there's a huge burden in collecting the signatures is a huge amount of work.

273
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:28,188
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once those signatures are collected,

274
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:47,390
[SPEAKER_05]: people have to run, and then whoever chooses to run has to put in the work to get on the ballot campaign, and then put in the 18-month term of learning about the charter, coming up with those recommendations, and it's all volunteer.

275
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:49,292
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a big ask.

276
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:55,978
[SPEAKER_05]: So from that point of view, appointing a committee of people, they're still volunteers,

277
00:28:57,055 --> 00:29:16,443
[SPEAKER_05]: it's taking away some of the burden that, you know, maybe somebody who really wanted to be involved in charter review might be willing to do it, but if they found out they had to run for office, which is a considerable amount of work.

278
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,045
[SPEAKER_02]: And like costs, I would imagine too.

279
00:29:20,305 --> 00:29:21,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.

280
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:23,887
[SPEAKER_05]: It is cost if you want,

281
00:29:25,294 --> 00:29:26,395
[SPEAKER_05]: create literature.

282
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:30,057
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to, you know, do a mailings are very expensive.

283
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:32,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there's that.

284
00:29:32,959 --> 00:29:36,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's something that I actually hadn't thought of.

285
00:29:36,722 --> 00:29:38,423
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's yeah, quite an undertaking.

286
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,966
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wonder too, about like, like you were alluding to who that would exclude from the process, right?

287
00:29:42,986 --> 00:29:47,229
[SPEAKER_02]: People, you know, need to do that could either fundraise or support their own campaigns.

288
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:48,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

289
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, interesting.

290
00:29:49,151 --> 00:29:49,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

291
00:29:50,637 --> 00:29:51,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

292
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:55,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, are there any other questions that I haven't asked you that you think are important for us to hear about?

293
00:29:58,262 --> 00:29:58,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

294
00:29:59,022 --> 00:30:06,066
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I just, I really hope that people just continue to get involved in Charter Review.

295
00:30:06,146 --> 00:30:11,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I know, you know, we started, like I said, meeting, I think our first meeting was in January.

296
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,752
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was pretty good turnout for first meeting.

297
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:19,975
[SPEAKER_05]: I just put it out like on the, you know, Medford politics groups on Facebook and

298
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,800
[SPEAKER_05]: And there were about 30 people.

299
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:29,341
[SPEAKER_05]: And since then, we have over 100 people on our list now.

300
00:30:29,521 --> 00:30:33,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the things that we talk about is outreach.

301
00:30:33,903 --> 00:30:49,827
[SPEAKER_05]: We really wanna find ways to reach out to just different groups in the city, go to like the West Metro Community Center, the Senior Center, the churches, the Chamber of Commerce, just as many places as we can to reach

302
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:59,151
[SPEAKER_05]: different populations that hopefully will get involved in this and either learn about it.

303
00:30:59,951 --> 00:31:01,452
[SPEAKER_05]: We really want people to learn about it.

304
00:31:02,252 --> 00:31:15,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Either maybe they'll be interested in actually trying to serve on a committee or commission or just communicate with whoever does that so that this review is truly a community

305
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:33,035
[SPEAKER_05]: voice, you know, we want the voice of people in the community to be involved in this because it's our city government and it makes a difference in everything, in our lives, in our daily lives.

306
00:31:34,096 --> 00:31:47,107
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think when you laid out that timeline, folks who would be able to vote when we're actually able to vote about these things, so who might not be a voting age yet, so younger folks getting involved, like I wonder if there's an interest there.

307
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:48,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

308
00:31:48,498 --> 00:31:51,140
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's another group that we want to reach out to.

309
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:54,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, there's the CCSR.

310
00:31:54,802 --> 00:32:01,786
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the right acronym at the high school that gets involved in a lot of civic issues in the city.

311
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:04,607
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, absolutely.

312
00:32:04,987 --> 00:32:07,949
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, getting young people involved is very important to me.

313
00:32:12,616 --> 00:32:13,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm glad you brought that up.

314
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:20,829
[SPEAKER_02]: You actually, I think, are the first parent-child group that I've had both on the podcast.

315
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:23,253
[SPEAKER_02]: So Abigail was on the podcast during the election season as well.

316
00:32:23,273 --> 00:32:24,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's right.

317
00:32:24,635 --> 00:32:25,516
[SPEAKER_02]: An active family.

318
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:25,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

319
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, well, I learned a lot.

320
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:37,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think it would be normal if people came away from this interview feeling a little confused, because it is a complicated process, right?

321
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:41,127
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think reading up and, yeah, go ahead.

322
00:32:41,287 --> 00:32:42,388
[SPEAKER_05]: It is complicated.

323
00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:56,216
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the complicated part is understanding the roots to charter review, and that's where we are right now, because we haven't been able to actually, once the charter review is initiated, then we'll just be talking about charter review.

324
00:32:56,916 --> 00:33:00,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now we're talking about getting the charter review to happen.

325
00:33:01,758 --> 00:33:17,603
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and, and we don't know which route we're taking, but we're, you know, like I said, we're, we're preparing the signature drive if we need to go that route, but we're also communicating with the mayor, and to see if we can get an appointed committee.

326
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:26,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And once that happens, we'll be more focused on actually talking about the things that matter to people.

327
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now we're just like, hey, we want this to happen.

328
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:38,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, which I think could feel like a hard thing to talk about where there's not, you know, it's like just getting to that point has taken so much work.

329
00:33:39,045 --> 00:33:44,027
[SPEAKER_02]: But I really appreciate all of your dedication and the other folks' dedication to getting this moved forward.

330
00:33:44,747 --> 00:33:45,107
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

331
00:33:45,227 --> 00:33:46,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it feels really good.

332
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:48,809
[SPEAKER_05]: It just feels like,

333
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no doubt that it is going to happen.

334
00:33:52,873 --> 00:33:58,437
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to have a charter review one way or another, and that feels really exciting.

335
00:34:00,098 --> 00:34:01,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it just feels good.

336
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,821
[SPEAKER_05]: It feels good to work on something that I know is going to be successful.

337
00:34:05,742 --> 00:34:06,843
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that concept.

338
00:34:08,184 --> 00:34:13,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much for talking with me today and for delivering us all this information.
