I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

20
00:09:39,793 --> 00:09:40,013
Ms.

21
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:45,935
Mastone, there's a motion on the floor for suspension of the rules to give out awards tonight.

22
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:47,595
All those in favor?

23
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:48,176
Aye.

24
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:49,416
All those opposed?

25
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:50,956
Suspension is granted.

27
00:09:55,478 --> 00:09:55,638
Ms.

28
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,058
Queza?

29
00:10:04,101 --> 00:10:04,761
Good evening.

30
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:05,541
Good evening.

31
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:15,837
We have a few different awards, many events that have taken place for English Language Arts and Social Studies this year, so we'll be calling up some students to receive awards.

32
00:10:16,037 --> 00:10:18,478
I'm gonna begin with the Scholastic Writing Awards.

33
00:10:19,138 --> 00:10:26,402
If I can ask the students who are receiving those awards to line up over here, I think it will move the process along a lot more smoothly.

34
00:10:26,442 --> 00:10:27,262
Thank you very much.

35
00:10:27,282 --> 00:10:27,642
Okay.

36
00:10:28,103 --> 00:10:31,224
Scholastic Writing Awards, if you could line up please on this side.

37
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:32,505
Right over there.

38
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,236
Could you just give a brief intro on these?

39
00:10:36,296 --> 00:10:36,576
Yes.

40
00:10:38,656 --> 00:10:44,598
The Scholastic Writing Awards is an important opportunity for students to be recognized for their creative talents.

41
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:54,701
There are several different categories that students can enter, and I'm very pleased to say that this is the second year we've had middle school students in addition to high school students entering.

42
00:10:55,281 --> 00:11:03,784
This program is for students for grades 7 through 12, and all writing pieces are judged on originality, technical skill,

43
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:06,112
and the emergence of personal voice.

44
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:16,158
At the national level, we do have students who won a gold key and a silver key have the opportunity to submit nationally.

45
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:26,985
And I'm very pleased to say that in addition to all of the state recipients that we'll honor tonight, we also have a silver medal for a student that won the national competition.

46
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:28,566
So she will be called up as well.

47
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:36,259
I want to thank, before we call the students, all the teachers who worked tirelessly to help with the students with the written production.

48
00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:37,399
We have Ms.

49
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:39,860
Lou, and we have Mr. Morris, who are here tonight.

50
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,062
We also have Mr. Bowen Flynn, Mr. Heinegg.

51
00:11:50,205 --> 00:11:50,406
Ms.

52
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:52,587

53
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:53,407

54
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:56,108
Mr. Heinegg, I said.

55
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,149
Mr. Bowen Flynn.

56
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:58,071
and Ms.

57
00:11:58,111 --> 00:12:00,173
Sanford, who worked with the students.

58
00:12:00,673 --> 00:12:08,458
So if we can call the students up, I think you'll begin first with the National Silver Medal, and then they'll go from there.

59
00:12:09,058 --> 00:12:09,699
Thank you.

60
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:10,599
No, that's not first.

61
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,160
Let's see.

62
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,760
Oh, it's in there.

63
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,381
It's fine.

64
00:12:21,002 --> 00:12:23,004
We could just go in the order, it's there.

65
00:12:23,244 --> 00:12:23,464

Sorry, false alarm.

70
00:12:34,993 --> 00:12:36,013
Okay, Roy, where are they?

71
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:45,741

We'll do you next.

134
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,126
Would you like to do a little intro?

135
00:20:32,688 --> 00:20:37,459
I think Mrs. Van Aken is going to do the intro for the art award, so I'll call her up if that's okay.

136
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:37,960
Absolutely.

137
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,280
All right.

138
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:44,255
Hello.

Hello, Your Honor, Mr. Bilson.

140
00:20:47,757 --> 00:20:54,661
It's a pleasure to be here, to be able to recognize these young artists for their hard work.

141
00:20:55,641 --> 00:21:09,529
The objective of the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards is to foster the confidence in these young artists, encourage them to broaden their creative horizons, and to give them the opportunity to be recognized

142
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:14,653
for their creative achievements locally, nationally, and statewide.

143
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:24,521
Many of the artworks from this year's award recipients, you don't know this yet, but bring it my way,

144
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:41,730
My students know already, but I would like to put your work on display at the Leadership Awards Night at the high school, which is the 28th of May, if you could get it to me or talk to me somehow.

145
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,832
I would love to put it out for everybody to enjoy that evening.

146
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:50,515
This is a powerful glimpse into the lives of these young teenagers.

147
00:21:50,535 --> 00:21:52,216

148
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:53,777

00:23:14,333 --> 00:23:15,113

164
00:24:08,951 --> 00:24:09,471
Okay.

165
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,332
Buck ball, science fair.

166
00:24:15,013 --> 00:24:15,373
All right.

167
00:24:15,513 --> 00:24:18,215
We're going to move to the Model United Nations.

168
00:24:18,275 --> 00:24:19,956
Is that okay, or would you prefer something?

169
00:24:20,136 --> 00:24:20,516
That's fine.

170
00:24:20,536 --> 00:24:20,876
That's good?

171
00:24:21,116 --> 00:24:21,476
Okay.

172
00:24:22,657 --> 00:24:23,417
I can do that.

173
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:25,718
All right.

174
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:28,080
Model United Nations.

175
00:24:29,881 --> 00:24:31,261
Can I give a brief overview of it?

176
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:31,922
Yes, of course.

177
00:24:32,142 --> 00:24:32,262
Okay.

178
00:24:32,502 --> 00:24:42,047
On two different occasions, we had a group of high school and middle school students attend the Invitational Innovative Model United Nations.

179
00:24:42,407 --> 00:24:44,248
It was held at Northeastern University.

180
00:24:45,271 --> 00:24:48,933
And it's sponsored by the United Nations Association of Greater Boston.

181
00:24:49,854 --> 00:25:05,564
This year, the middle school students were challenged to develop a collective approach to international food security, while high school students worked together with students from across the region to address nuclear proliferation.

182
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:13,629
Although the high school has participated in the past, this is the second year we've had the middle school come to form a team as well.

183
00:25:14,811 --> 00:25:21,696
This year, our high school students represented China, New Zealand, Malaysia, Cuba, Germany, and Kenya.

184
00:25:22,317 --> 00:25:32,465
And the two regional conferences covered topics from maternal health, containment of ISIS, peacekeeping, climate change, free press, and human trafficking.

185
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:43,674
All participating students were exemplary in their performance, and I'm very pleased to say that in addition to their participation, we also won awards for best negotiators and best position papers.

186
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,251
I'd like to thank Ms.

187
00:25:45,271 --> 00:25:51,674
Dineyu, who led the high school team, who cannot be here tonight, for facilitating that group to the two different events.

188
00:25:52,694 --> 00:25:58,177
Our middle school students represented Australia, France, and the United States.

189
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:04,600
The students did a wonderful job as well, and they also won some additional awards, including Best Public Speaker.

190
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,002
And for the middle school group, I'd like to thank Mr. DiClemente.

191
00:26:08,022 --> 00:26:09,963
I'm not sure if he made it back.

192
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:21,213
He worked diligently with the students after school to prepare them for this event.

193
00:26:21,554 --> 00:26:22,974
I'm so proud of both groups.

194
00:26:23,034 --> 00:26:25,736
I'm so proud that we were able to do the middle and the high school.

195
00:26:26,276 --> 00:26:29,018
And there's a whole list of awards there for you to read.

196
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,180

00:26:34,181 --> 00:26:35,601

Congratulations again.

I can go in whatever order you want, so.

274
00:36:09,444 --> 00:36:09,584
OK.

275
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:12,986
We have the State Geography B finals.

276
00:36:13,106 --> 00:36:13,447
Great.

277
00:36:13,627 --> 00:36:14,827
Medford Public Schools.

278
00:36:15,988 --> 00:36:18,049
We have Amin Nazi.

279
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,170
Amin?

280
00:36:21,372 --> 00:36:21,572
No?

281
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:23,373
OK.

282
00:36:24,112 --> 00:36:26,614
Can I just tell you a little bit about the Geography Bee?

283
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:33,999
This year for the Geography Bee, Amin, he finished in the top 12 of the Geography Bee.

284
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:35,180
He's in middle school.

285
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,741
They take the competition at the school level.

286
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:43,145
Then they have to take a qualifying test to qualify to go to states.

287
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:48,374
and from there, they compete at the state level.

288
00:36:48,874 --> 00:37:00,656
Amin only missed one question, and he also chose to take the challenge round, which meant that he actually answered all of the questions from the final round, and he did so correctly.

289
00:37:00,716 --> 00:37:04,737
So therefore, in total, he just missed one question.

290
00:37:05,138 --> 00:37:15,000
So proud of him, and I guess he's not here tonight, but his teacher, Mr. McCarthy, also worked quite hard with him as well, so congratulations to him.

291
00:37:23,258 --> 00:37:24,142
Congratulations.

292
00:37:24,222 --> 00:37:25,045
Shout out to Amin.

293
00:37:30,024 --> 00:37:32,285
All-State High School Journalist, would you like to do that?

294
00:37:32,305 --> 00:37:32,505
Sure.

295
00:37:33,445 --> 00:37:39,607
We have a lot of good things going on in our department, so this is a wonderful night for English and Social Studies.

296
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:42,549
All-State Journalism Staff Award.

297
00:37:43,009 --> 00:37:52,032
The Humanities Department is pleased to congratulate one of our students who was named as the first All-State Journalist by the state of Massachusetts.

298
00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:54,913
Only five of them in the state of Massachusetts.

299
00:37:55,277 --> 00:38:00,299
And she won among students from Wellesley High School and Newton South High School.

300
00:38:00,759 --> 00:38:13,424
In order to be considered, students had to enter online portfolios that demonstrated their excellence in writing, their journalism resume, and reflections on their career thus far as a journalist.

301
00:38:13,604 --> 00:38:15,205
So you have the name in front of you.

302
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:16,485
We're so proud of her.

303
00:38:16,765 --> 00:38:18,426
And congratulations.

304
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:19,206
Ms.

305
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:21,987
Kylie Roy, Allstate High School Journalist.

306
00:38:32,081 --> 00:38:35,843
She's also quite the photographer, if anyone's noticing.

307
00:38:37,004 --> 00:38:37,124
Yes.

308
00:38:37,164 --> 00:38:38,224
Congratulations, Carly.

309
00:38:38,264 --> 00:38:39,325
Nice accomplishments.

310
00:38:40,445 --> 00:38:41,326
Very proud of you.

311
00:38:41,346 --> 00:38:42,727
Kudos.

312
00:38:51,731 --> 00:38:52,912
National History Day?

313
00:38:53,132 --> 00:38:55,073
Sure.

314
00:38:55,473 --> 00:38:56,674
Carly, congratulations.

315
00:38:57,154 --> 00:38:58,915
Mr. Ambrose wishes he could be here tonight.

316
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:01,362
National History Day?

317
00:39:01,622 --> 00:39:01,982
Okay.

318
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:08,985
The Greater Boston District puts on the National History Day.

319
00:39:09,005 --> 00:39:11,166
It takes place in Stona, Massachusetts.

320
00:39:11,826 --> 00:39:15,848
Nationally, there are over a half a million students who compete in this historic day.

321
00:39:16,828 --> 00:39:18,329
Students are provided with a theme.

322
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,710
The theme this year was take a stand.

323
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,612
And they can choose from different categories to submit

324
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:26,020
their product.

325
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:32,805
Medford students in Stoneham competed alongside 200 other students from the region.

326
00:39:33,426 --> 00:39:36,148
And we want to recognize them tonight.

327
00:39:36,508 --> 00:39:43,714
I also want to mention that in June, we're going to have our own National History Day, as we've had in the past few years.

328
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:45,716
You'll all receive invitations.

329
00:39:46,096 --> 00:39:50,580
So students who may not have submitted for this contest, which is in early March,

330
00:39:51,674 --> 00:39:56,458
all have different products that they completed, so we welcome you to come and you'll get invitations for that.

331
00:39:56,838 --> 00:40:08,626
But the students that we're gonna call took the time to get this done early, to do the annotated bibliographies that go with it, quite a lot of work, and we're just so proud of them for competing.

332
00:40:08,666 --> 00:40:09,847
Very nice, great job.

333
00:40:10,427 --> 00:40:14,190

Only one honorable mention.

337
00:40:38,381 --> 00:40:39,823
That's very difficult to do.

338
00:40:39,864 --> 00:40:40,665
Congratulations.

Okay.

350
00:42:15,468 --> 00:42:15,988
One more, right?

351
00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:18,909
One more?

352
00:42:19,629 --> 00:42:20,870
The Holocaust essay?

353
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,631
Yes, yes.

354
00:42:23,051 --> 00:42:28,073
I'm going to provide you with an Ethics Bowl team update in a minute, but our last award to give to students is

355
00:42:28,872 --> 00:42:32,034
The Israel Are Better Holocaust Essay Contest.

356
00:42:32,435 --> 00:42:43,843
Now, this is the 10th annual contest, and this is the first time that Medford student has been successful, a freshman, in achieving the award.

357
00:42:43,863 --> 00:42:56,572
The contest is coordinated by the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Boston, the Combined Jewish Philanthropies, Facing History and Ourselves, and the American Association of Jewish Holocaust Survivors of Greater Boston.

358
00:42:57,315 --> 00:43:08,362
The winner tonight, she did a great job with her essay reflecting upon Elie Wiesel's concept of compassion and the impact of its definition.

359
00:43:08,822 --> 00:43:14,826
The winner received an educational scholarship of $750, and we're just so proud.

360
00:43:14,866 --> 00:43:25,173
I wanna thank again, Miss Liu, this is her student who won the award, and she's been submitting from some time, and I think we were very pleased to have

361
00:43:25,654 --> 00:43:27,418
this winner this year, and we should be very proud.

362
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:33,331
And the winner is... Phaedra Martin, second place.

363
00:43:47,366 --> 00:43:48,047
Great job.

364
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:48,867
Excellent.

365
00:43:50,048 --> 00:43:55,612
Thank you very much for all the students that came up and all the teachers that mentored them throughout this whole process.

366
00:43:55,872 --> 00:43:58,354
We are so very lucky to have you in our school system.

367
00:43:58,394 --> 00:44:00,556
So thank you all for that segment.

368
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:02,997
And now we're going to move to science.

369
00:44:04,218 --> 00:44:04,579
Oh, Ms.

370
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:05,059
Van de Kloot.

371
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:05,960
Congratulations, Phaedra.

372
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:06,940
Hold on.

373
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,741
Congratulations, Phaedra.

374
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:15,803
I noticed that it said that the students' work would be posted on our website with their parents' permission.

375
00:44:16,143 --> 00:44:21,164
And I have to say, when it was posted last year, I read every one, and it was great.

376
00:44:21,544 --> 00:44:26,045
So I really hope that, parents, you give permission so that we can read your students' work.

377
00:44:26,505 --> 00:44:27,686
Thank you for mentioning that.

378
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:28,126
Very good.

379
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:28,666
Thank you, Ms.

380
00:44:28,686 --> 00:44:31,347
Vanderpoot.

381
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:31,807
Okay.

382
00:44:33,675 --> 00:44:35,557
I believe Mr. Cieri is in the audience.

383
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:36,197
There he is.

384
00:44:36,217 --> 00:44:41,021
We're going to do the Medford High School Science Fair Awards next.

385
00:44:42,622 --> 00:44:43,523
Good evening, everyone.

386
00:44:43,543 --> 00:44:50,969
48 Medford High School students participated in the annual Science Fair at Medford High School this year.

387
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:56,773
From our event, a select number of students move on to regional and state events.

388
00:44:57,574 --> 00:45:00,156
These events go from March all the way to May.

389
00:45:00,616 --> 00:45:02,278
In fact, last week or

390
00:45:03,578 --> 00:45:08,480
I think it was last Saturday, not this past Saturday, it was the very final event, which was the state fair.

391
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:15,923
So there are a large number of events that students pass through in order to qualify for each level.

392
00:45:17,024 --> 00:45:22,426
At the regional fair, there are two students that placed in the top 26.

393
00:45:23,647 --> 00:45:30,930
Those students moved on to the state fair, and they placed there as well this past week, so we're really excited to be able to present our awards tonight.

394
00:45:31,702 --> 00:45:38,346
to all the students that won an award at our fair, and to recognize those students that participated in the regional and state fair.

395
00:45:38,706 --> 00:45:39,107
Very good.

396
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:39,767
Excellent.

397
00:45:40,647 --> 00:45:44,830
Would the science fair recipients like to line up, just to make it a little easier for you?

398
00:45:56,398 --> 00:46:00,181
Albert Farrar, Freshman-Sophomore Panel, 2017, first place.

399
00:46:00,581 --> 00:46:06,725

405
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:22,322

Congratulations.

410
00:48:04,821 --> 00:48:05,101
Good job.

411
00:48:05,121 --> 00:48:05,321
Thank you.

412
00:48:08,083 --> 00:48:08,923
Bernifka St.

413
00:48:08,983 --> 00:48:11,324
Jean, junior senior panel, second place.

414
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:20,109
Hi, how are you?

415
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,131
Congratulations.

416
00:48:23,832 --> 00:48:24,672
Senior.

417
00:48:25,533 --> 00:48:26,673
Senior.

418
00:48:27,934 --> 00:48:31,296

419
00:48:43,192 --> 00:48:46,174

00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:07,505
Leora Ferrari, Junior Senior, Honorable Mention.

422
00:49:19,621 --> 00:49:20,041
Thank you.

423
00:49:21,862 --> 00:49:22,583
Thank you very much.

424
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:33,370
I do want to mention that the Farrer brothers, Albert and Joseph both continued on to the regional and the state fair and were placed in both.

425
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:41,415
So thank you.

426
00:49:42,576 --> 00:49:46,038
Next up we have the butt ball tournament winners.

427
00:49:53,693 --> 00:49:55,216
You'll see a theme happen here.

428
00:49:59,804 --> 00:50:00,726
Good evening, Miss Joy.

429
00:50:00,926 --> 00:50:01,587
Good evening.

430
00:50:02,244 --> 00:50:12,467
we're very proud of this group of students that we bring before you tonight and you've seen some familiar faces that tells you a little bit of how well-rounded these students are.

431
00:50:14,107 --> 00:50:26,171
They competed this year at the 2017 Greater New England Regional Bot Ball Tournament at the University of Massachusetts Lowell on Saturday, April 29th.

432
00:50:27,891 --> 00:50:31,912
The team, under the advisership of mathematics teacher Ms.

433
00:50:31,952 --> 00:50:43,036
Barbara Chen, with the support from, my day, Technology of Medford, proudly brought back four awards to the district.

434
00:50:44,056 --> 00:50:49,660
First, they scored a second-place overall trophy.

435
00:50:50,561 --> 00:51:01,629
Secondly, a Spirit of Botball trophy, a seeding third-place certificate, and double elimination third-place certificate.

436
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:08,354
The team finished second overall out of 18 teams, and this is

437
00:51:09,294 --> 00:51:11,296
over all of New England.

438
00:51:11,376 --> 00:51:23,148
The overall winners for the ball are determined by their double elimination rank, seedling round scores online, and on-site documentation scores.

439
00:51:23,828 --> 00:51:25,310
In the seeding,

440
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:33,073
The teams run their robots unopposed in an attempt to score the most points possible.

441
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:49,519
In double elimination, the robots from two different teams compete on the game table simultaneously in an effort to score as many points as possible, but also to keep their opponent from scoring.

442
00:51:50,459 --> 00:51:59,582
In the category of judges' choice trophies, the judges singled out Medford's team for the Spirit of Ball Ball award.

443
00:52:00,062 --> 00:52:05,984
So we would like to congratulate the team members for their hard work, determination, and perseverance.

444
00:52:06,044 --> 00:52:08,285
They were here many, many long nights.

445
00:52:08,965 --> 00:52:09,245
And Ms.

446
00:52:09,325 --> 00:52:16,648
Barbara Chen for her leadership and oversight, and parents, guardians, and community members for their support.

447
00:52:26,667 --> 00:52:28,769
Our first recipient is Ms.

448
00:52:28,829 --> 00:52:30,250
Barbara Chen, advisor.

449
00:52:41,098 --> 00:52:41,518
Nice job.

450
00:52:41,538 --> 00:52:44,581
Would you like to say a few words?

451
00:52:45,181 --> 00:52:46,082
Would you like to speak?

452
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,122
Either one.

453
00:52:48,343 --> 00:52:50,365
I'm so proud of the team.

454
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:53,327
The students work very, very hard.

455
00:52:53,387 --> 00:52:55,769
They take a lot of determination and

456
00:52:56,577 --> 00:53:05,020
and also persevere, and also they have to make a lot of decisions on their own because adults are not supposed to be involved in the competition.

457
00:53:05,261 --> 00:53:11,123
And so they have to decide which strategy to use, whose strategy to use, okay?

458
00:53:11,143 --> 00:53:13,484
So they have a lot of time to work as a team.

459
00:53:14,544 --> 00:53:22,748
So this is time for them to develop, work together, collaboratively, and they enjoy working together.

481
00:56:07,428 --> 00:56:14,091
Is Mr. Van Schor here?

482
00:56:24,302 --> 00:56:24,462
Ms.

483
00:56:24,502 --> 00:56:24,802
Joy?

484
00:56:25,783 --> 00:56:25,943
Ms.

485
00:56:26,003 --> 00:56:27,064
Vivian Shore?

486
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:27,164
No?

487
00:56:27,224 --> 00:56:27,785
She's not here?

488
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:28,946
Very good.

489
00:56:29,026 --> 00:56:34,970
Congratulations.

490
00:56:35,691 --> 00:56:36,231
Absolutely.

491
00:56:36,271 --> 00:56:37,332
Mr. Superintendent.

492
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:44,698
Dear members of the school committee, ladies and gentlemen, as you look around, you see the incredible achievements of our young people.

493
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:48,461
But also very important, two things that I want to highlight.

494
00:56:49,141 --> 00:56:53,765
One, the diversity of our student body and the achievements of this diversity.

495
00:56:58,013 --> 00:57:07,116
And I think that's one of the factors that makes Medford so great and a great place to grow up, because you get to grow up and experience a lot of different cultures and work together.

496
00:57:07,576 --> 00:57:16,619
And the second key thing is that all of these achievements come through collaboration, working together with your teachers, working with each other, working as a team.

497
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,380
And that's the secret to success in almost anything.

498
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,361
Very few people do anything alone by themselves without good help.

499
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:26,431
And so congratulations to all of you, to your parents.

500
00:57:27,052 --> 00:57:28,293
They've collaborated with you.

501
00:57:28,373 --> 00:57:29,493
You've collaborated with them.

502
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:30,914
You've collaborated with each other.

503
00:57:31,675 --> 00:57:39,240
And you make Medford very proud of the way you represent us, both as a diverse community and as a community that cares about its people.

504
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:39,840
Thank you.

505
00:57:48,052 --> 00:57:50,914
And we have to send a thank you to the parents, of course.

506
00:57:50,994 --> 00:57:54,998
Without their support, some of these things would not come to fruition.

507
00:57:55,018 --> 00:57:59,942
So thank you parents out there and everyone who has raised a child.

508
00:58:00,002 --> 00:58:00,823
Thank you.

509
00:58:02,424 --> 00:58:04,346
Now we'll revert to the regular order of business.

510
00:58:04,386 --> 00:58:05,407
Is there a motion by Ms.

511
00:58:05,427 --> 00:58:05,947
Mustone?

512
00:58:06,407 --> 00:58:07,308
I believe that's it.

513
00:58:07,348 --> 00:58:08,849
Is someone seconded?

514
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,010
All those in favor?

515
00:58:10,731 --> 00:58:11,492
All those opposed?

516
00:58:13,277 --> 00:58:14,578
Yeah.

517
00:58:14,598 --> 00:58:17,499
Approval of the minutes of May 1st, 2017.

518
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:18,239
Approval by Ms.

519
00:58:18,259 --> 00:58:19,900
Disceri, seconded by Ms.

520
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:20,500
Cuno.

521
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,421
All those in favor?

522
00:58:22,281 --> 00:58:23,001
All those opposed?

523
00:58:23,061 --> 00:58:23,862
Motion passes.

524
00:58:25,763 --> 00:58:26,243
Congrats.

525
00:58:28,664 --> 00:58:30,745
Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

526
00:58:30,825 --> 00:58:31,986
Motion for approval by Ms.

527
00:58:32,006 --> 00:58:34,147
Disceri, seconded by Ms.

528
00:58:34,167 --> 00:58:34,787
DiBenedetto.

529
00:58:39,234 --> 00:58:40,055
Mr. Benedetto.

530
00:58:40,075 --> 00:58:45,198
Okay, on page 3 of 13, there's an amount of $2,188.17 for Frank D'Alessaro.

531
00:58:45,218 --> 00:58:45,939
It says, student activities.

532
00:58:45,959 --> 00:58:47,860
That seemed like a lot for a student.

533
00:58:48,721 --> 00:58:49,081
Page 13?

534
00:58:49,121 --> 00:58:49,542
3 of 13.

535
00:58:49,582 --> 00:58:49,762
3 of 13.

536
00:58:50,042 --> 00:58:52,243
Mr. Delosio is in charge of the Mustang Mall.

537
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:06,292
And so undoubtedly, this is reimbursement for product that he had to buy on behalf of that activity.

538
00:59:06,352 --> 00:59:06,752
Thank you.

539
00:59:07,853 --> 00:59:10,716
I had a couple others, Mr. Bellson, if you don't mind.

540
00:59:11,257 --> 00:59:13,740
On page 6 of 13, under

541
00:59:19,179 --> 00:59:25,863
Method High miscellaneous charges, it's woodwind and brass wind, $2,125.

542
00:59:27,744 --> 00:59:36,290
Is that for equipment for our high school band, or it just says miscellaneous charges, it's not like directed to a department or anything?

543
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:37,090
It said page six.

544
00:59:37,611 --> 00:59:41,453
Page six of 13, three quarts, it's about eight pounds.

545
00:59:41,473 --> 00:59:43,935
Woodwind and brass wind, Method High miscellaneous charges.

546
00:59:44,095 --> 00:59:48,118
That's undoubtedly to support the woodwind orchestra activities.

547
00:59:49,138 --> 00:59:55,202
Okay, it just seemed unusual to have a miscellaneous charge of that amount.

548
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:55,763
On account.

549
00:59:56,683 --> 00:59:56,824
Ms.

550
00:59:56,864 --> 00:59:58,164
Vanderclue, point of information?

551
00:59:58,184 --> 01:00:03,608
Yes, as a secretary, when I signed the bills, I remember signing that and looking at it specifically.

552
01:00:03,628 --> 01:00:13,735
I have to tell you because it's two weeks ago, I don't remember what it was, but I specifically looked at it and checked it because I, too, was like the way that it was categorized seemed funny, but it made

553
01:00:14,435 --> 01:00:21,477
Once I saw what it was it was it made it perfect sense, okay?

554
01:00:22,977 --> 01:00:38,422
In relation to that I was just wondering if we sold any of the pieces as well Saturday we actually everything was sold at auction and I believe that Free discount free, you know the auctioneer's price which is 10% that they brought in about $20,000.

555
01:00:38,462 --> 01:00:38,482
I

556
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:41,167
Great, so we'll get a report on that.

557
01:00:41,187 --> 01:00:41,827
We'll get a report on that.

558
01:00:41,927 --> 01:00:42,327
Thank you.

559
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,168
Happening this Saturday, so I need a little more time.

560
01:00:44,448 --> 01:00:49,371
And then my last question is the last two items on the list on page 13 of 13.

561
01:00:50,611 --> 01:01:00,556
And it's professional technical services educational, and there's a person's name with the amount of like $2,500 total.

562
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:04,278
Trying to, where is this again?

563
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:05,479
The last two line items.

564
01:01:05,499 --> 01:01:06,880
The last two items, last page.

565
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:07,480
Xenia?

566
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:08,921
Thank you.

567
01:01:10,305 --> 01:01:10,826
On page what?

568
01:01:11,306 --> 01:01:12,587
The last page 13 of 13.

569
01:01:14,549 --> 01:01:15,830
Last two items listed.

570
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:16,671
The last two.

571
01:01:17,505 --> 01:01:21,326
I'll just have to look that up when I get back to the office.

572
01:01:21,346 --> 01:01:22,386
It's a weird number, 112.

573
01:01:22,506 --> 01:01:24,127
It's like a grand capital account.

574
01:01:24,467 --> 01:01:24,667
Yeah.

575
01:01:25,407 --> 01:01:26,567
Yeah, I was just curious.

576
01:01:26,587 --> 01:01:28,788
Yeah, I'd just like to, before I, yeah.

577
01:01:28,808 --> 01:01:30,348
Sure, I'll have to look that up when I get back.

578
01:01:31,148 --> 01:01:33,869
Just like sometimes, a little information and knowledge, that's all.

579
01:01:33,889 --> 01:01:35,069
Sure, I understand.

580
01:01:35,169 --> 01:01:39,871
I have no problem with approving the bills and hearing back from the superintendent about that item.

581
01:01:40,471 --> 01:01:42,391
On the second, motion for approval.

582
01:01:42,531 --> 01:01:43,351
All those in favor?

583
01:01:43,371 --> 01:01:43,771
Aye.

584
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:44,712
All those opposed?

585
01:01:44,752 --> 01:01:45,512
Motion passes.

586
01:01:47,444 --> 01:01:49,185
Approval of payroll.

587
01:01:49,385 --> 01:01:51,287
Motion for approval, seconded by Ms.

588
01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:51,747
Cuno.

589
01:01:51,787 --> 01:01:52,527
All those in favor?

590
01:01:52,928 --> 01:01:53,028
Aye.

591
01:01:53,288 --> 01:01:54,048
All those opposed?

592
01:01:54,289 --> 01:01:55,029
Motion passes.

593
01:01:55,529 --> 01:01:56,590
Report of secretary.

594
01:01:56,770 --> 01:01:57,351
There is none.

595
01:01:58,852 --> 01:01:59,832
Report of committees.

596
01:01:59,892 --> 01:02:00,933
Committee of the whole, May 10, 2017.

597
01:02:01,213 --> 01:02:03,195
Mr. Superintendent.

598
01:02:03,215 --> 01:02:05,796
Oh, it's right here.

599
01:02:05,816 --> 01:02:11,320
Madam members of the committee, this is the committee of the whole that we held last Wednesday on the school councils.

600
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:12,181
It's here.

601
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:14,622
Rather than read it in totality,

602
01:02:16,527 --> 01:02:25,074
If anyone has any particular questions, there's anything in it, you can certainly respond to it, but I think it's self-explanatory and we'll just enter into the record with your approval.

603
01:02:26,656 --> 01:02:27,416
Mr. Benedetto.

604
01:02:28,935 --> 01:02:47,048
I know at this meeting we had a very productive meeting and we met with all the principals as well as some teaching staff and it was really good insight as to what's going on at each building and how they use the funds that they were allocated this year and what their needs are for next year and I appreciate the manner in which it's all presented.

605
01:02:47,408 --> 01:02:50,510
But at that meeting we were supposed to have a secondary agenda item.

606
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:56,113
And it's not listed in the minutes, and it wasn't presented at that night, the PTO information.

607
01:02:56,393 --> 01:03:03,976
So I would like it added to the minutes because we had moved that report to the subcommittee meeting, and then it didn't happen at subcommittee meeting.

608
01:03:04,277 --> 01:03:06,538
So I want it noted that it didn't happen there.

609
01:03:06,958 --> 01:03:13,621
So if you could amend these notes and bring them back to us at our next meeting for approval, I'd be happy with moving forward.

610
01:03:13,701 --> 01:03:15,202
It's still under request of report.

611
01:03:16,523 --> 01:03:26,011
I know but I want it noted that it was discussed this evening and that it was supposed to be discussed and brought up at that subcommittee meeting and it wasn't.

612
01:03:26,131 --> 01:03:28,894
On the motion as amended for the Committee of the Whole report.

613
01:03:29,134 --> 01:03:29,955
All those in favor?

614
01:03:30,355 --> 01:03:30,435
Aye.

615
01:03:30,795 --> 01:03:31,516
All those opposed?

616
01:03:31,576 --> 01:03:32,357
Motion passes.

617
01:03:32,577 --> 01:03:33,017
Thank you.

618
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:35,540
Mr. Skerry.

619
01:03:36,801 --> 01:03:42,686
In reference to our Committee of the Whole meeting and through you to the superintendent, after going through

620
01:03:43,065 --> 01:03:54,071
thoroughly in these reports for many years, Mr. Superintendent, it seems that, uh, this school year, there was a, uh, an under, uh, amount of parent involvement and community reps.

621
01:03:54,131 --> 01:04:03,036
And I was wondering if we could instill in our principals to kindly build up the, uh, parents that, uh, advised them during the, uh, the year.

622
01:04:03,116 --> 01:04:10,780
And if we could get some, yeah, if we could get some more, uh, uh, commitment from the community to, uh, work on these school plans and, uh, hopefully,

623
01:04:11,655 --> 01:04:13,096
keep up the good work that we're doing.

624
01:04:14,196 --> 01:04:23,139
I realize it's tough, but I really think there should be a fair amount of parent participation in these meetings during the year when they present their findings to us.

625
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,060
So I just would comment on that.

626
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:30,082
The parents participated in the council development.

627
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:37,225
The attendance at the presentation on Wednesday evening was dependent on the school itself.

628
01:04:37,820 --> 01:04:39,981
and several parents were there and were introduced.

629
01:04:40,842 --> 01:04:45,824
One school did not have anyone there specifically, except one member who's actually a member of the school committee.

630
01:04:46,265 --> 01:04:54,609
But other than that, each school did introduce people, and there are like seven members on a council, so it isn't like there's 50 people on a council.

631
01:04:54,629 --> 01:05:01,533
But I hear what you're saying, and certainly we'll... I just feel that there should be more parent input if we're going to foster transparency.

632
01:05:02,464 --> 01:05:03,305
It's in the report.

633
01:05:03,325 --> 01:05:08,952
I would hope that the councils would actually consult with the parents more completely, but it's a seven-member council.

634
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:12,096
So, you know, theoretically, the report reflects them.

635
01:05:12,436 --> 01:05:14,739
The high school and the voc have students on it, but the other

636
01:05:15,505 --> 01:05:18,366
especially parents and community members.

637
01:05:18,426 --> 01:05:22,568
Just as one community member, I'd like to see more parent involvement in their kids' education.

638
01:05:23,268 --> 01:05:23,548
Okay.

639
01:05:23,868 --> 01:05:24,588
Ms.

640
01:05:24,628 --> 01:05:25,729
Cuno, then Ms.

641
01:05:25,769 --> 01:05:26,229
Van de Kloot.

642
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,790
Yeah, just a point of information on the site councils.

643
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:42,475
Some of the schools actually, if I'm not mistaken, I don't know if it was all the elementary schools, it's been a while, but I do know that at the beginning of the year, they have some type of almost, I don't want to say an election, but they do have,

644
01:05:43,655 --> 01:06:01,951
the letters that go out to the parents, asking if they are interested in joining, and then if they do get too many parents, because I guess the bylaws does say that there's supposed to be a certain amount on the site councils, that that's when it is brought into some type of an election or a voting system in each school.

645
01:06:03,132 --> 01:06:05,214
Over the years, I have been involved.

646
01:06:06,498 --> 01:06:08,381
And so I know that that's how it's worked.

647
01:06:08,562 --> 01:06:12,889
I know that that's how it's worked in the middle schools and in the high school vocational side.

648
01:06:13,290 --> 01:06:18,499
I do want to mention that this year, the last actually couple of years, the high school and the vocational side.

649
01:06:18,909 --> 01:06:24,291
have had a lot more parent participation than we've ever had from both sides over the years.

650
01:06:24,351 --> 01:06:34,496
Unfortunately, depending on people's schedules, too, everybody's busy, that we have not had as many from the vocational side on the high school side.

651
01:06:34,836 --> 01:06:36,356
So that was just point of information.

652
01:06:37,497 --> 01:06:37,677
Ms.

653
01:06:37,717 --> 01:06:38,177
Van de Kloot.

654
01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:43,619
I noticed at the end of the minutes of the meeting that there were various different items that were discussed.

655
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:47,481
And one, we had spent considerable time at an earlier meeting, which was

656
01:06:48,094 --> 01:06:51,075
broadcasts on TV publicly, so I just want to read it for the record.

657
01:06:52,275 --> 01:06:56,496
Meeting with Attorney General clarified the B-1, B-2 enforcement issue.

658
01:06:56,997 --> 01:07:01,178
Schools are not an agent of the federal government for the enforcement of immigration law.

659
01:07:01,598 --> 01:07:05,679
Therefore, our schools do not have to remove any existing B-1, B-2 students.

660
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:13,361
This was a concern among many of the members, if all the members of the school committee, so I'm just glad to see that that was resolved.

661
01:07:13,961 --> 01:07:15,122
Also, as a question on...

662
01:07:16,286 --> 01:07:23,411
see that there was discussion to allow direct appointment of fine arts director and the technology director by the superintendent.

663
01:07:23,712 --> 01:07:28,075
And I want to ask the superintendent if he's made those appointments yet.

664
01:07:28,435 --> 01:07:32,818
The appointment letters are now in process and probably will go out either this week or the beginning of next.

665
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:33,459
OK.

666
01:07:33,639 --> 01:07:33,959
Thank you.

667
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:35,420
Very good.

668
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:36,321
Thank you very much.

669
01:07:36,981 --> 01:07:38,443
Community participation.

670
01:07:38,503 --> 01:07:40,464
Is there anyone wishing to speak this evening?

671
01:07:41,985 --> 01:07:42,305
Anyone?

672
01:07:43,557 --> 01:07:45,919
Did we make a motion to accept these?

673
01:07:45,959 --> 01:07:49,442
We did a motion, yeah.

674
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,123
Reports of the superintendent.

675
01:07:51,203 --> 01:07:53,945
Pre-budget report, English Language Arts.

676
01:07:54,646 --> 01:07:55,346
Mr. Superintendent.

677
01:07:55,366 --> 01:08:00,290
We call upon our director of English Language Arts and Humanities, Dr. Nicole Chiesa.

678
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:00,891
Dr. Chiesa.

679
01:08:01,091 --> 01:08:09,438
Good evening again.

680
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:16,343
Is it possible to give the Ethics Bowl update prior to going into the pre-budget report?

681
01:08:16,463 --> 01:08:16,783
Okay.

682
01:08:17,483 --> 01:08:24,387
I wanted to update you all on the Ethics Bowl competition that occurred in North Carolina during the weekend of April 8th.

683
01:08:24,888 --> 01:08:32,432
Thanks to the generosity of the Medford School Committee, our Medford High School Ethics Bowl traveled to University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.

684
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:39,636
When they were there, they participated in the 2017 National High School Ethics Bowl competition, along with 24 other schools.

685
01:08:42,087 --> 01:08:44,088
They won two rounds unanimously.

686
01:08:45,428 --> 01:08:48,069
They lost a third round just by one point.

687
01:08:48,749 --> 01:08:54,912
And when they tally up the points to make it to the final round, they just fell short just a little bit.

688
01:08:55,732 --> 01:09:00,613
Their poise, their character, and their skill was unprecedented.

689
01:09:01,074 --> 01:09:04,295
And I want to thank Mr. Esner, who led that group, and Ms.

690
01:09:04,335 --> 01:09:06,715
Parsons, who chaperoned the group as well.

691
01:09:07,156 --> 01:09:11,117
I'm very proud to say that the Medford Ethics Bowl team

692
01:09:11,537 --> 01:09:13,398
finished in the top 10 in the nation.

693
01:09:13,978 --> 01:09:16,720
And that is impressive beyond me.

694
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,202
And so thank you for your generosity in supporting the students.

695
01:09:20,402 --> 01:09:24,104
It was a wonderful trip, and we all greatly appreciate it.

696
01:09:24,404 --> 01:09:30,888
And a few of the students that came up this evening were whispering in the superintendent in my ear that they had placed in the top 10.

697
01:09:30,928 --> 01:09:32,829
So they're very, very proud of that accomplishment.

698
01:09:32,869 --> 01:09:33,549
That's wonderful.

699
01:09:33,569 --> 01:09:40,013
And we didn't have certificates tonight because we had honored them in the past, but I certainly want to make sure you had an update on that.

700
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,060
Thank you very much.

701
01:09:41,121 --> 01:09:41,581
Thank you.

702
01:09:41,601 --> 01:09:41,641
OK.

703
01:09:44,323 --> 01:09:46,004
So the English Language Arts budget.

704
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:51,608
The English Language Arts is dedicated to supporting all our teachers in the district.

705
01:09:52,308 --> 01:09:57,952
Our curriculum is aligned to the 2011 Massachusetts English Language Arts curriculum framework.

706
01:09:59,393 --> 01:10:05,057
At the elementary level, our instructional materials include Journeys 2014 and additional trade books.

707
01:10:05,677 --> 01:10:09,620
At the middle and high school level, we have Houghton Mifflin anthologies.

708
01:10:10,212 --> 01:10:13,213
periodicals, and fictional and non-fictional texts.

709
01:10:14,114 --> 01:10:18,435
There are 29 teachers total in the middle school and high school.

710
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:27,699
And seven teachers at the Andrews, seven at the McGlynn, 13 at the high school, and two at the vocational school.

711
01:10:28,159 --> 01:10:32,921
And one teacher, we have a, and two, excuse me, two at the vocational school.

712
01:10:34,181 --> 01:10:35,622
This year in terms of funding,

713
01:10:36,168 --> 01:10:50,459
We were able to purchase some additional Amazon Kindle Fires, which we have identified as being a great investment in terms of keeping the quality of the text compared to using it on the Kindle.

714
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:57,945
We purchased some additional Journeys materials due to some rising numbers in the classrooms at the various grade levels.

715
01:10:59,165 --> 01:11:05,090
Appropriated budget funding also supported the purchase of instructional materials at the middle and high school

716
01:11:05,652 --> 01:11:14,035
including periodicals, and additional informational and fictional texts were purchased in order to allow for continuity among the grade levels.

717
01:11:16,396 --> 01:11:25,319
Accomplishments for this year included continued implementation of over 100 e-readers at the high school and middle school level.

718
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:34,443
We continued to do some mock MCAS testing at the elementary and middle school to help comfort students as they prepare for this new

719
01:11:34,941 --> 01:11:36,321
format in the exam.

720
01:11:37,342 --> 01:11:41,603
We refined some different assessments based on curriculum needs and demands.

721
01:11:42,403 --> 01:11:48,705
We stayed current with some recent changes that have just occurred to the 2011 ELA framework.

722
01:11:50,446 --> 01:11:56,648
You saw many of the authentic learning opportunities tonight that we achieved great success with.

723
01:11:57,948 --> 01:12:04,090
This year in terms of requesting for funding, I'm asking for an additional funds to purchase Study Island.

724
01:12:05,548 --> 01:12:06,429
for the middle school.

725
01:12:07,709 --> 01:12:14,133
And that would be supporting for the RTI piece at the middle school level for English.

726
01:12:14,393 --> 01:12:20,617
And I'm also asking for additional materials to support Tier 2 and Tier 3 intervention at the elementary level.

727
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:25,719
Not sure if anyone has any questions, but thank you for your time for that.

728
01:12:26,179 --> 01:12:30,061
There's a motion to receive and place on file this report.

729
01:12:30,081 --> 01:12:31,081
Is there any?

730
01:12:31,482 --> 01:12:32,242
Seconded by Ms.

731
01:12:32,282 --> 01:12:32,602
Kretz.

732
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:33,623
All those in favor?

733
01:12:34,263 --> 01:12:34,963
All those opposed?

734
01:12:35,043 --> 01:12:35,744
Motion passes.

735
01:12:36,784 --> 01:12:37,184
Thank you.

736
01:12:37,204 --> 01:12:37,865
Thank you.

737
01:12:39,646 --> 01:12:40,866
One question, Mr. Benedetto.

738
01:12:41,346 --> 01:12:41,667
Thank you.

739
01:12:44,213 --> 01:12:53,379
When we were talking last week with some of the principals, there was a strong request for RTI staff.

740
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,480
Is this $17,000?

741
01:12:54,861 --> 01:12:56,622
What would that go towards?

742
01:12:56,922 --> 01:12:59,864
Additional materials for the program.

743
01:13:00,364 --> 01:13:04,667
There are quite a bit of Tier 2 and Tier 3 interventions.

744
01:13:04,727 --> 01:13:07,770
We have them, but a lot of them are consumables.

745
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:13,874
For example, there's a write-in reader where in the paragraph it's highlighted for the child.

746
01:13:14,318 --> 01:13:16,098
and the child can go in and underline.

747
01:13:16,398 --> 01:13:18,919
So those are the consumables for the Tier 2 and Tier 3.

748
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:21,940
I'm not talking staffing in that request.

749
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:22,480
OK.

750
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:27,321
So there was a request for that, and there was a lot of talk about the need for that.

751
01:13:27,361 --> 01:13:30,982
And I'd like your opinion on that.

752
01:13:31,322 --> 01:13:33,522
In terms of staffing for intervention?

753
01:13:33,562 --> 01:13:34,162
Yeah.

754
01:13:34,302 --> 01:13:38,943
I think that first, we want to look at the logistics of the schedule.

755
01:13:38,963 --> 01:13:40,984
And I've already engaged after that meeting.

756
01:13:43,163 --> 01:13:44,664
received some of the feedback from that meeting.

757
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:53,308
I already spoke with some principals just in terms of organizing the schedule, and I talked briefly with Ms.

758
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:56,990
Caldwell, Assistant Superintendent Caldwell, about that, which we'll engage more in.

759
01:13:57,370 --> 01:14:09,957
I think it's logistically, in terms of time, if you can logistically put an RTI block in there, but the teachers do have the intervention tools, and we have the program

760
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:16,041
in place with the existing interventions, that's the need for the additional cost.

761
01:14:16,621 --> 01:14:19,882
I don't feel a need for additional staffing at this time.

762
01:14:19,982 --> 01:14:23,003
I'd like to see how it works with the logistics.

763
01:14:23,043 --> 01:14:27,364
We do it at the Andrews a lot in terms of scheduling that RTI block.

764
01:14:28,004 --> 01:14:30,944
To me, that's step one in terms of getting that in.

765
01:14:31,344 --> 01:14:32,325
Does that answer your question?

766
01:14:36,027 --> 01:14:52,992
what was helpful to me is that there were some teachers present and they explained that they do on their own time, early morning, lunch time, and I know teachers do that in general, and I know that not all teachers can do that because of their home situations, they might not have that ability.

767
01:14:53,132 --> 01:15:04,435
You know, young children, different reasons that they can't, and I just want to make sure that, you know, kids that need tier two and tier three, they need more than the materials, and some children, you know,

768
01:15:05,757 --> 01:15:10,260
You know, we, what my goal here is to growth in MCAF scoring.

769
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:23,269
And I really believe that having people, you know, work with those kids that are so close to moving to the next level, that if we do have services in place that our schools will grow.

770
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:25,491
And that's, that's the community goal.

771
01:15:25,571 --> 01:15:29,554
Not only the school committee goal or administrative goal or teacher goal.

772
01:15:29,974 --> 01:15:31,415
You know, that's a community goal.

773
01:15:31,754 --> 01:15:40,947
So I just want to make sure that if that's the need, in order to make that growth happen, that we meet that need for the Tier 2 and Tier 3 children.

774
01:15:42,225 --> 01:15:48,191
Sometimes, I know the superintendent talks a lot about differentiating instruction, and I agree with that wholeheartedly.

775
01:15:48,512 --> 01:15:55,239
But we're at a point now that we really need to make strides and want to make strides in growth with our schools.

776
01:15:55,319 --> 01:16:04,408
And if this is the step necessary, I really would like to look at that before we close this budget, so that way we can appropriate the correct funding for it.

777
01:16:04,775 --> 01:16:13,178
So any time that you have to look at this prior to budget, I would like to hear from you and the administrative team.

778
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:16,739
You guys are the experts, but I also heard from the front lines already.

779
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:20,040
So I'm going to take that very seriously as well.

780
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:31,904
If I may mention too, some of the tier two interventions that I'm referencing really give a targeted pre-assessment to figure out where the child is struggling in the reading.

781
01:16:32,024 --> 01:16:32,985
Is it fluency?

782
01:16:33,045 --> 01:16:34,065
Is it comprehension?

783
01:16:34,861 --> 01:16:41,943
These materials can then help hone in on the child's need and the grouping and where they need that help.

784
01:16:42,303 --> 01:16:44,583
But I have looked at it and I will look at it again.

785
01:16:44,723 --> 01:16:49,965
Right now I feel like logistically we need to look at how the schedules align and go from there.

786
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:53,686
And I want to say thank you for all your support on that too.

787
01:16:53,986 --> 01:16:54,346
Thank you.

788
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:54,826
Thank you.

789
01:16:55,917 --> 01:16:56,317
Thank you.

790
01:16:56,757 --> 01:17:01,418
And I understand in ELA, our scores are a little higher than they are in the math.

791
01:17:01,798 --> 01:17:13,041
So, you know, I'm going to ask the same questions about math because district wide, our math scores are good, but like there's room for growth in any situation.

792
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:19,403
So I know ELA, it might be a little different than it is the situation and the scenario with the math.

793
01:17:19,863 --> 01:17:20,663
So thank you.

794
01:17:20,843 --> 01:17:25,204
And I look forward to hearing more from you before the budget about, um,

795
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:27,815
what you really think that we need to do.

796
01:17:28,035 --> 01:17:31,297
And I just really want you to speak to some of the people on the front.

797
01:17:31,377 --> 01:17:32,598
I know you do on a daily basis.

798
01:17:32,618 --> 01:17:36,540
Yeah, I followed up with a few after that meeting as well, and I will continue to do so.

799
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:37,160
Thank you.

800
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:37,640
Thanks.

801
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:38,061
Thank you.

802
01:17:38,881 --> 01:17:40,162
Thank you for the time, Mayor Burke.

803
01:17:40,794 --> 01:17:41,274
You're welcome.

804
01:17:41,455 --> 01:17:43,296
We've already received and placed that on file.

805
01:17:43,336 --> 01:17:45,598
Now the Social Studies Pre-Budget Report.

806
01:17:46,099 --> 01:17:46,619
Me again.

807
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:48,821
You'll be done with me soon.

808
01:17:49,882 --> 01:18:00,431
The Social Studies Department is committed to providing all students with the academic and problem-solving skills essential for personal development, citizenship, and lifelong learning.

809
01:18:01,331 --> 01:18:05,575
We have 27.5 teachers combined in the middle and high school.

810
01:18:06,313 --> 01:18:15,976
That would be six teachers at the Andrews Middle School, six teachers at the McGlynn Middle School, 14.5 at the high school, and one at the vocational school.

811
01:18:17,237 --> 01:18:26,960
With the generous support of the school committee in terms of funding for last year, we were able to purchase some additional eighth grade social studies textbooks, brand new for them.

812
01:18:27,858 --> 01:18:41,405
We also purchased some additional online subscriptions for teachers because we find every day with social studies things are changing and the online subscriptions make a lot of sense in terms of keeping us current with what's going on in the world.

813
01:18:42,225 --> 01:18:50,730
Appropriated budget funding also supported the purchase of instructional materials at the middle and high school level and we had some additional replacement textbooks.

814
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:56,893
In addition to that, we purchased managing licenses for the Chromebooks in order to

815
01:18:58,781 --> 01:19:06,706
ease any technology issues so we could look at it as a whole through the technology department.

816
01:19:06,866 --> 01:19:10,328
And we also purchased some additional carts for the security of the Chromebooks.

817
01:19:10,768 --> 01:19:14,570
This is for the Global Scholars Program, which is offered at the seventh grade level.

818
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:25,077
Funding also supported numerous authentic learning opportunities, which is so powerful for these students, including the Model United Nations that you saw tonight,

819
01:19:26,435 --> 01:19:33,076
We have the Royal House visits coming up for grade five and some other authentic opportunities as well.

820
01:19:33,697 --> 01:19:37,797
And of course we had some periodicals that were purchased for the middle and high school level.

821
01:19:39,438 --> 01:19:47,459
In terms of accomplishments for this year, I want to point out that we've had a significant increase in our senior year offerings.

822
01:19:47,919 --> 01:19:51,360
In the past few years we've had four senior classes

823
01:19:52,245 --> 01:20:04,931
that were either created or reinstated at the high school level that are fully, that are not filled to capacity, they're not bursting at the seams, but they're very popular in choice for students.

824
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:14,736
That includes our honors economics class, we brought back our AP comparative government class, and so it's quite strong showing at the high school level.

825
01:20:16,036 --> 01:20:16,577
In addition,

826
01:20:18,052 --> 01:20:29,139
We also continued as another accomplishment to really support the Global Scholars Program, including a field trip to the Museum of Science this year, which was wonderful for the seventh grade students.

827
01:20:30,099 --> 01:20:47,670
We've had a significant increase in community partnerships over the last year, including participating in our Veterans Day that you had a report on in the fall, Day on the Hill, National History Day at the middle and high school level, that Model United Nations that we just honored students for,

828
01:20:48,285 --> 01:20:50,486
Law Day, Student Government Day.

829
01:20:51,066 --> 01:20:56,047
It's a great experience for many different students at many different grade levels, which is important.

830
01:20:57,307 --> 01:21:02,368
We continue to do full integration of grades 9 and 10 at the high school and vocational classes.

831
01:21:02,988 --> 01:21:09,990
And we continued with our inclusion, full inclusion at the co-teaching classes for the high school and vocational.

832
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:16,312
This year, for additional funding, I am requesting $16,000 in additional funding

833
01:21:18,363 --> 01:21:20,104
for our grade 11 U.S.

834
01:21:20,144 --> 01:21:21,245
history textbooks.

835
01:21:22,245 --> 01:21:30,451
And the funding would also support an advanced placement human geography class that we are offering at the high school next year.

836
01:21:31,631 --> 01:21:33,212
And that's it.

837
01:21:34,493 --> 01:21:36,575
Thank you.

838
01:21:37,075 --> 01:21:44,220
Does the human geography course, will it be in place of one of the other AP courses or its addition to?

839
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,541
We don't think it will be in place.

840
01:21:46,941 --> 01:21:47,402
It might.

841
01:21:49,035 --> 01:21:51,676
We have to see where the numbers lie with the course requests.

842
01:21:51,756 --> 01:22:00,980
I can tell you right now we have 45 students that have already requested it, and our other senior classes still look quite strong in terms of participation.

843
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,441
So we're not pulling away that I can see from anything.

844
01:22:04,601 --> 01:22:15,045
Of course, if a child asks for AP Human Geography and honors econ, and for some reason the schedule was the same period, which we try to avoid, obviously, that would be the only way it would pull.

845
01:22:15,448 --> 01:22:17,269
But no, this is just additional interest.

846
01:22:17,309 --> 01:22:17,750
That's great.

847
01:22:17,770 --> 01:22:18,030
Thank you.

848
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:18,951
Yeah, it's fabulous.

849
01:22:19,511 --> 01:22:20,191
It's been great.

850
01:22:20,392 --> 01:22:20,792
Excellent.

851
01:22:22,093 --> 01:22:22,573
Very good.

852
01:22:22,593 --> 01:22:25,515
Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file by Ms.

853
01:22:25,535 --> 01:22:25,796
Cuno?

854
01:22:25,816 --> 01:22:26,016
Second.

855
01:22:26,056 --> 01:22:26,696
Seconded by Ms.

856
01:22:26,716 --> 01:22:27,277
Van de Kloot.

857
01:22:27,717 --> 01:22:28,517
All those in favor?

858
01:22:28,538 --> 01:22:28,978
Aye.

859
01:22:29,238 --> 01:22:29,939
All those opposed?

860
01:22:29,999 --> 01:22:30,599
Motion passes.

861
01:22:30,619 --> 01:22:31,460
Thank you very much tonight.

862
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:32,280
Thank you so much for this evening.

863
01:22:32,300 --> 01:22:32,741
Great job, by the way.

864
01:22:32,761 --> 01:22:33,941
Great job leading this department.

865
01:22:33,961 --> 01:22:34,142
Thank you.

866
01:22:34,322 --> 01:22:35,042
Thank you very much.

867
01:22:35,062 --> 01:22:35,703
Appreciate it.

868
01:22:36,043 --> 01:22:37,744
Departments.

869
01:22:39,646 --> 01:22:40,526
All right.

870
01:22:40,546 --> 01:22:43,068
OK, report on summer programs 2017, Mr. Superintendent.

871
01:22:44,696 --> 01:22:47,497
Call upon our deputy superintendent to present this report.

872
01:22:48,177 --> 01:22:48,357
Ms.

873
01:22:48,397 --> 01:22:48,817
Nelson.

874
01:22:50,457 --> 01:22:50,858
Good evening.

875
01:22:51,338 --> 01:22:51,838
Good evening.

876
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:59,100
We've been busy organizing our summer programs, and we have a full complement of programs.

877
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:03,701
Some of them, as you know, are tuition-based.

878
01:23:04,281 --> 01:23:09,682
Some of them are supported by grants, and some of them are supported by regular budgets.

879
01:23:09,742 --> 01:23:12,563
We thank the school committee for those particular programs.

880
01:23:14,323 --> 01:23:22,006
Again, many of the programs are academic, some are recreational, and some are a combination of both.

881
01:23:22,046 --> 01:23:26,967
And we're really servicing all grades from pre-K through grade 12.

882
01:23:27,847 --> 01:23:30,228
The dates and times of the programs vary.

883
01:23:30,988 --> 01:23:37,870
School does end on the 22nd, so most of the programs will start that next Monday, which is June 26th.

884
01:23:38,771 --> 01:23:42,672
And just about all of them are ended by the end of August.

885
01:23:43,218 --> 01:23:44,919
or the third week in August.

886
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:58,451
We are currently in the process of arranging to staff our programs, identifying students who should attend, and arranging outreach to families on the various programs.

887
01:23:59,251 --> 01:24:01,433
You have a summary of each of the programs.

888
01:24:02,014 --> 01:24:08,099
The Summer Fund Program is pretty much as it's been in past years to service elementary students.

889
01:24:08,759 --> 01:24:09,700
It begins on the 26th.

890
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:11,722
It ends on August 18th.

891
01:24:12,982 --> 01:24:15,003
and it's for students in grades K through 6.

892
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:16,063
It's a full day.

893
01:24:16,944 --> 01:24:19,525
It begins at 7.30 a.m.

894
01:24:19,545 --> 01:24:22,146
and ends at 4.30 p.m.

895
01:24:23,866 --> 01:24:32,490
Families sign up by the week, and the cost is $145 per week, and it includes breakfast every day and pizza on Fridays.

896
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:40,733
Regular summer school, this is for students who have failed a subject, grades 6 through 12, who have to make up

897
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:44,356
the subject in order to advance to the next grades.

898
01:24:45,337 --> 01:24:48,738
And this year, we're doing things a little differently.

899
01:24:49,138 --> 01:24:59,542
The programs all start on June 26 and end on August 8, which is consistent with the 30-day school committee requirement.

900
01:25:00,603 --> 01:25:02,784
And all the programs are at Medford High School.

901
01:25:04,084 --> 01:25:08,406
And again, student tuition supports the programs.

902
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:12,212
Students pay $250 a course if they're Medford students.

903
01:25:12,693 --> 01:25:19,157
And we do have a number of outside students who are paying a little bit more, $300 per course.

904
01:25:19,558 --> 01:25:22,240
If you recall, last year we conducted a pilot.

905
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:28,804
And that pilot was to offer online courses for all of the makeup science courses.

906
01:25:29,345 --> 01:25:32,967
Well, that proved to be very successful for many reasons.

907
01:25:33,448 --> 01:25:34,349
It was engaging.

908
01:25:34,449 --> 01:25:36,250
Students had kind of a different approach

909
01:25:36,908 --> 01:25:42,171
to their learning, which was kind of welcomed after, you know, a year of regular instruction.

910
01:25:42,932 --> 01:25:46,574
The other thing that this did, we were able to offer more science courses.

911
01:25:47,014 --> 01:25:53,098
So we actually had students from other communities that didn't have these courses coming to Medford.

912
01:25:53,438 --> 01:25:55,539
So that helped to generate a little bit more money.

913
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:01,263
And the other very big plus is that, you know, officially summer school has an ending date.

914
01:26:01,743 --> 01:26:04,985
And there are students who sometimes just need a little extra time.

915
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:13,673
This provided them with the time because we allowed those students, because they could work at their own pace, to have a few more weeks in August to complete.

916
01:26:14,293 --> 01:26:25,096
And as the supervisors of summer school were telling me as we were debriefing, this led to several more students actually making it over the bar because they had that extra time.

917
01:26:25,856 --> 01:26:34,139
So given on that experience and given on the fact that the school system has made a commitment to online learning, we've purchased

918
01:26:35,212 --> 01:26:37,973
a subscription with Admentum, which is online courses.

919
01:26:38,213 --> 01:26:42,294
And currently, we have seniors who are doing credit recovery using this.

920
01:26:42,794 --> 01:26:45,594
We have other students who are just taking supplemental courses.

921
01:26:46,435 --> 01:26:50,376
And we decided that all of summer school will be online.

922
01:26:50,576 --> 01:26:54,457
Again, we're going to have facilitators for each subject area.

923
01:26:55,017 --> 01:27:04,779
What they're doing is they're looking at the course that's the package course, and they're making any modifications to make sure it aligns completely with our own courses.

924
01:27:05,444 --> 01:27:10,946
And again, we will be running our summer school online for those grades.

925
01:27:11,447 --> 01:27:31,975
The only exception is grades 6 and 7 because, again, in debriefing about what happened last year, the summer school coordinators, Jill Sawyer and David Blau, said that the 6th and 7th graders taking, you know, all that academic instruction was really very difficult for them, and they really needed a different model.

926
01:27:32,795 --> 01:27:39,039
So for 6th and 7th graders, they will still be at the high school, but they'll have, you know, kind of a different section of the high school.

927
01:27:39,519 --> 01:27:46,204
And they will have regular instruction because we felt that age group maybe couldn't handle complete online instruction.

928
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:54,949
And then what we plan to do is to have kind of a break in the middle and offer some kind of an activity that is an enrichment activity.

929
01:27:54,989 --> 01:27:58,431
And we're kind of making our decisions now on what that will be.

930
01:27:58,491 --> 01:28:00,773
I think we might do a little bit of social-emotional.

931
01:28:01,915 --> 01:28:07,861
One week, we'll actually bring them into the vocational setting and let them know more about vocational education.

932
01:28:08,762 --> 01:28:10,783
We'll probably have some recreational things.

933
01:28:10,823 --> 01:28:12,865
They can run around and blow off some steam.

934
01:28:13,226 --> 01:28:18,310
And that will be in the middle part because many of these youngsters have to stay for both the English and math.

935
01:28:19,251 --> 01:28:20,112
So that's our plan.

936
01:28:20,772 --> 01:28:24,095
We're hoping that, you know, this is a big improvement on what happened last year.

937
01:28:24,696 --> 01:28:27,979
And again, that's what we will be doing for regular summer school.

938
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:39,852
Other programs, and we have several other programs, our English Language Learner Summer Program will service newcomers for the most part, elementary, middle, and high school students.

939
01:28:40,572 --> 01:28:42,152
This program will be at the McGlynn.

940
01:28:42,792 --> 01:28:47,193
We've contained our programs to the high school, the McGlynn, and the Roberts.

941
01:28:47,893 --> 01:28:57,615
And I know that already I've given John McLaughlin the schedule so he can begin the cleaning, so we're kind of, you know, working that so all the buildings, even though they're being used during the summer,

942
01:28:57,998 --> 01:29:01,720
will be properly cleaned when students return in August.

943
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:07,122
Again, you can see the schedule for those EL programs.

944
01:29:07,402 --> 01:29:16,406
And again, they are very helpful for these youngsters who really need to have that continuity of language acquisition throughout the summer months.

945
01:29:18,207 --> 01:29:22,388
Last year and this year, we're having our middle school computer science camp.

946
01:29:23,169 --> 01:29:26,110
It's really run through the grant that Molly Layden

947
01:29:26,605 --> 01:29:28,246
has throughout the school year.

948
01:29:28,306 --> 01:29:39,716
It's for one week, and these are middle school students that have been involved in this project, where they're basically learning about apps and actually designing apps.

949
01:29:39,776 --> 01:29:42,519
It's very exciting for the students and very engaging.

950
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:48,544
The Medford Vocational Technical School Exploratory Program, again, for middle school students.

951
01:29:48,584 --> 01:29:49,945
This was successful last year.

952
01:29:50,425 --> 01:29:54,349
It's a two-week program, and students are coming in.

953
01:29:55,329 --> 01:30:07,255
Learning about vocational education, they'll decide, I'm not quite sure exactly which shops are going to be open for them to use, but they will actually develop a product to take home with them at the end of the experience.

954
01:30:07,675 --> 01:30:12,798
So that's another program that's worked out very well, so we wanted to continue that.

955
01:30:12,818 --> 01:30:14,999
High School 101.

956
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:20,242
Again, this program started when we had our academic support grant.

957
01:30:21,171 --> 01:30:27,855
And it was so successful that once the grant dried up, the school committee decided to support it through regular budget.

958
01:30:28,596 --> 01:30:47,188
And it's been a wonderful program because what we do here is we have our students who are entering grade nine who have been identified as students who maybe need a little bit of an extra push and a little bit of extra help in, you know, getting into grade nine in terms of finishing their summer work.

959
01:30:47,768 --> 01:30:50,450
All eighth grade students have English and mathematics summer work.

960
01:30:51,295 --> 01:30:56,679
And we have found that, you know, when they get to school, some of them just haven't done this work.

961
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:01,862
So we want to make sure that they're there, not, you know, kind of getting off to a bad start.

962
01:31:02,142 --> 01:31:09,507
So what we do is we bring them in three days in August, the last week before school begins.

963
01:31:10,287 --> 01:31:14,290
They have teachers there who are helping them to finish this work.

964
01:31:14,932 --> 01:31:17,333
And they do academic work for three days.

965
01:31:17,853 --> 01:31:23,714
They also have a chance to meet many of the high school administrators because all the administrators are back at this time.

966
01:31:24,294 --> 01:31:25,955
And they get tours of the building.

967
01:31:26,415 --> 01:31:31,056
And then we finish that program with day four, which is the regular ninth grade orientation.

968
01:31:31,516 --> 01:31:39,178
So these students actually have kind of three extra days where they're getting acclimated to the high school, finishing up their summer work.

969
01:31:40,518 --> 01:31:43,519
And again, we have a very high attendance rate.

970
01:31:44,372 --> 01:31:47,294
for the kids that are invited to participate.

971
01:31:47,714 --> 01:31:49,515
So that is very exciting as well.

972
01:31:49,535 --> 01:31:56,718
A full complement of special education programs, some of them will be at the high school, some of them will be at the Roberts.

973
01:31:57,259 --> 01:32:04,442
We have all of our nursing staff in place for the students that need any kind of help with health issues.

974
01:32:05,163 --> 01:32:11,366
And again, you can see the dates and the special education programs are generally developed from the students IEPs.

975
01:32:11,706 --> 01:32:13,747
So these are students who really need summer services

976
01:32:14,872 --> 01:32:17,333
to satisfy the requirements of their IEPs.

977
01:32:18,114 --> 01:32:18,934
So that's about it.

978
01:32:18,954 --> 01:32:24,717
A lot of things going on, very busy, and we'll be all set to begin right after school gets out.

979
01:32:25,417 --> 01:32:25,898
Questions?

980
01:32:26,478 --> 01:32:26,658
Ms.

981
01:32:26,698 --> 01:32:27,098
Cunha.

982
01:32:27,478 --> 01:32:27,939
Thank you.

983
01:32:28,459 --> 01:32:28,899
Thank you, Ms.

984
01:32:28,939 --> 01:32:30,460
Nelson, for the report.

985
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,941
We do have a lot going on, I guess, this summer, huh?

986
01:32:34,202 --> 01:32:36,743
So I just want to go over some of the summer school things.

987
01:32:37,183 --> 01:32:39,184
It's $250 for a method student, $300 for outside students, but

988
01:32:41,912 --> 01:32:44,833
Is that for all students, even if they're taking the online courses?

989
01:32:46,014 --> 01:32:51,276
These are students that have to make up courses, and so everybody pays the tuition fee.

990
01:32:51,376 --> 01:32:53,257
Okay, whether they're taking it online or not.

991
01:32:53,577 --> 01:32:53,858
Correct.

992
01:32:54,936 --> 01:33:02,819
The other thing is is that do we have a breakdown over the years or an idea of how many students for each of these courses?

993
01:33:03,319 --> 01:33:09,482
Like how many students do we get back for let's say high school 101, the students entering grade nine?

994
01:33:09,582 --> 01:33:12,863
From what I understand, you don't have to have a particular grade in that.

995
01:33:13,403 --> 01:33:14,244
It's open to anyone.

996
01:33:14,544 --> 01:33:17,345
No, it's not open to everybody because we couldn't accommodate everybody.

997
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:22,967
What it is is the teachers are currently, okay, when we had the grant, under the guidelines of the grant,

998
01:33:23,513 --> 01:33:34,679
the students that were invited to come to High School 101, we had to look at their MCAS scores, and they had a certain level, relatively, you know, either warning or needs improvement.

999
01:33:35,299 --> 01:33:36,399
Those students were invited.

1000
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:47,165
Now we no longer are under the grant, we don't have the guidelines, so what we are asking teachers to do is for the teachers to identify students that they think need this extra help.

1001
01:33:47,805 --> 01:33:53,208
Okay, students that they've had in class all year, who maybe don't finish their homework, or maybe haven't gotten

1002
01:33:54,090 --> 01:34:00,936
you know, a wonderful grade, maybe they're, you know, again, students who just need to have their hands held a little bit and walk through.

1003
01:34:01,296 --> 01:34:05,440
Because it's very, you know, the ninth grade teachers expect the students have this work done.

1004
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:11,785
And when the kids arrive day one and all of a sudden they don't have that work, it's not a great start, okay?

1005
01:34:11,805 --> 01:34:13,106
You don't want them to start behind.

1006
01:34:13,747 --> 01:34:21,133
So this has been very successful in making sure those students show up day one, having done the work that's expected of them,

1007
01:34:22,022 --> 01:34:27,146
And again, teachers are, the eighth grade teachers are identifying who we should invite.

1008
01:34:27,607 --> 01:34:31,150
We usually have about 40 students in the past.

1009
01:34:32,391 --> 01:34:35,353
And again, the ones that are invited, for the most part, they come.

1010
01:34:36,053 --> 01:34:36,514
They come.

1011
01:34:37,595 --> 01:34:44,080
And you were saying that using the online classes last year, it seemed like it was more successful.

1012
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:45,801
How many students did we have?

1013
01:34:46,422 --> 01:34:47,903
I'd have to get you the exact numbers.

1014
01:34:47,983 --> 01:34:50,225
It's any student that had to take a science makeup class.

1015
01:34:50,932 --> 01:34:51,572
did it online.

1016
01:34:51,792 --> 01:34:55,474
And I'd have to get from David or Jill the exact numbers of those students.

1017
01:34:55,514 --> 01:35:01,256
But again, things that happen, you know, when you try something out, you expect certain things.

1018
01:35:01,417 --> 01:35:05,958
But then sometimes there are extra things that are very good things that happen.

1019
01:35:05,978 --> 01:35:16,463
And I think one of the things that David and Jill were very excited about is that the students who would have had to end on that day in August when the last day of school took place and maybe would have failed,

1020
01:35:17,473 --> 01:35:24,818
were allowed to continue on on their own, and they were successful by having another two weeks where they could just work on this course.

1021
01:35:25,259 --> 01:35:28,501
And that's something we didn't really count on, but you know what, that's a great thing.

1022
01:35:28,881 --> 01:35:33,665
So summer school doesn't have to officially end when the teachers walk away from the students.

1023
01:35:33,685 --> 01:35:37,647
The students can still continue on and can be successful.

1024
01:35:38,168 --> 01:35:39,609
So we were very happy with that.

1025
01:35:39,649 --> 01:35:42,231
What was the feedback from the students?

1026
01:35:42,471 --> 01:35:44,893
From what I hear, they liked doing it online.

1027
01:35:45,921 --> 01:35:47,822
We don't just leave them by themselves in a room.

1028
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:52,066
I mean, there are teachers, facilitators there that they can ask questions.

1029
01:35:52,166 --> 01:35:57,010
We also make sure that somebody in technology is around in case something breaks down.

1030
01:35:57,510 --> 01:36:03,234
We're hoping to use, we're hoping to keep the classes because when we had just the science, we put them in the labs.

1031
01:36:03,795 --> 01:36:07,778
But now that we're going to have all the courses online, we're going to use regular classrooms with Chromebooks.

1032
01:36:08,579 --> 01:36:11,641
And again, we're kind of making sure that everything's going to work.

1033
01:36:11,661 --> 01:36:14,043
We're working with the technology department to make sure

1034
01:36:14,831 --> 01:36:18,972
If we have 100 kids online at one time, it's going to be successful.

1035
01:36:19,092 --> 01:36:21,853
So we're trying to flush all that out so there are no problems.

1036
01:36:22,453 --> 01:36:28,435
And as far as the assignments itself, are they assigned homework at the end of the day on these?

1037
01:36:29,216 --> 01:36:33,157
From what I understand, they can accelerate at their own pace.

1038
01:36:33,257 --> 01:36:39,959
I mean, they have to physically be at the high school to satisfy the requirement of being on site for those hours.

1039
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:43,060
But my understanding is pretty much self-paced.

1040
01:36:44,241 --> 01:36:51,524
Bernadette, you've worked with this too, and you can correct me if I'm giving misinformation, but they're pretty much self-paced and they're like in modules.

1041
01:36:52,044 --> 01:36:58,727
So actually, you and I might be taking the same course, sitting side by side, but you could be doing something very different.

1042
01:36:58,767 --> 01:37:02,368
Maybe you're well ahead of me and I'm just struggling to do something else.

1043
01:37:02,408 --> 01:37:05,109
So my understanding is that's how it works.

1044
01:37:05,169 --> 01:37:06,530
And Bernadette, if you want to add anything.

1045
01:37:07,805 --> 01:37:14,767
I just want to add that a student could log on at home, so if a student wanted to do more work.

1046
01:37:15,527 --> 01:37:21,009
But we do need to stay true to the requirement of the number of hours that they need to have in the classroom.

1047
01:37:22,149 --> 01:37:23,170
It's what's a balancing act.

1048
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:27,071
We don't want them to go too far ahead and then come to school with nothing to do.

1049
01:37:27,211 --> 01:37:33,233
So at least in the beginning, they will be encouraged to do the work within the classroom.

1050
01:37:33,393 --> 01:37:36,654
And then if they need it, certainly they'll be able to log on at home.

1051
01:37:37,407 --> 01:37:48,613
Because my concern... One additional thing, too, about the program, Edmentum, is that there are other things, like Bernadette said, what if we have that student who finishes the second day, I'm done with the course, very unlikely, but who knows.

1052
01:37:49,574 --> 01:37:56,097
We also have, there are other courses that are very helpful, like there's a course called Study Skills.

1053
01:37:56,617 --> 01:38:00,619
So some of these students could benefit from taking an online course on study skills.

1054
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:05,382
So if we see that happening, we can intervene with some other

1055
01:38:06,071 --> 01:38:27,672
products some other programs within this material that we've purchased that can be useful to these kids too because we just don't want them sitting there obviously Right and the other my other concern is I don't want children who don't have the accessibility of having laptops and computers at home even feeling worse because now if you know other people do have that accessibility

1056
01:38:28,163 --> 01:38:32,824
And I just don't want them coming to school and feeling like they're failing because now they're falling behind.

1057
01:38:33,264 --> 01:38:45,386
So I guess my question is, too, is after a certain hour that they're done, if students want to stay and go to the library and work a little bit extra because they don't have laptops or anything, do they have that accessibility?

1058
01:38:45,846 --> 01:38:46,586
Right now, no.

1059
01:38:47,066 --> 01:38:49,347
We'd have to, you know, obviously look into that.

1060
01:38:49,387 --> 01:38:52,587
That's a suggestion I can make to David and Jill.

1061
01:38:52,647 --> 01:38:55,588
If they can get staff to stay a little bit extra, that would be great.

1062
01:38:56,823 --> 01:39:01,506
Again, we will monitor, you know, what kids are doing in terms of.

1063
01:39:02,227 --> 01:39:07,790
The expectation is that they're doing this work in the hours that they're supposed to be in summer school.

1064
01:39:08,211 --> 01:39:11,013
But there are always kids who just feel, you know, we like that.

1065
01:39:11,033 --> 01:39:13,995
You don't want to stop somebody from going home and pursuing something.

1066
01:39:14,315 --> 01:39:15,776
So we don't want to discourage that.

1067
01:39:16,216 --> 01:39:22,820
So we'll try to find a way to work around it and maybe offer an extra hour in the library that they can come to.

1068
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:23,981
I'll speak to David about that.

1069
01:39:24,168 --> 01:39:24,468
Okay.

1070
01:39:24,588 --> 01:39:31,334
And you, last question was, is that you have, um, you have introductory physics, chemistry, and biology online.

1071
01:39:31,474 --> 01:39:33,676
Are those the same courses that are going to be provided this year?

1072
01:39:33,696 --> 01:39:34,977
Are you going to add more?

1073
01:39:35,197 --> 01:39:39,561
I think those are the three that were identified by Mrs. Cieri as what the kids needed to make up.

1074
01:39:40,562 --> 01:39:41,022
Okay.

1075
01:39:41,122 --> 01:39:41,823
Thank you so much.

1076
01:39:42,263 --> 01:39:42,443
Ms.

1077
01:39:42,463 --> 01:39:47,087
Mustone, I was just wondering about the English language learner summer program.

1078
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:54,929
So out of the newcomers at the Roberts and the newcomers at middle school and the newcomers at the high school, what percent would you say take advantage of it?

1079
01:39:54,949 --> 01:39:56,371
Because that, I think, is a great program.

1080
01:39:57,763 --> 01:40:01,566
I'd have to check with Mrs. Trotter on that.

1081
01:40:02,207 --> 01:40:05,329
It is free, so free always encourages people to come.

1082
01:40:05,349 --> 01:40:08,051
In lunch and transportation, I would think you could get a hundred percent.

1083
01:40:08,071 --> 01:40:08,852
Yeah, because she has the grant.

1084
01:40:08,912 --> 01:40:10,173
That's a Title III grant.

1085
01:40:10,213 --> 01:40:10,493
Okay.

1086
01:40:10,673 --> 01:40:20,141
I mean, it's unfortunate that, you know, some of the programs we can offer transportation, some we can offer food, but it really is dependent upon if we have grant funding for that.

1087
01:40:20,281 --> 01:40:24,305
So I can check with her to see how many kids actually

1088
01:40:25,592 --> 01:40:26,413
who are invited.

1089
01:40:27,874 --> 01:40:29,676
Those students are pretty motivated, though.

1090
01:40:29,736 --> 01:40:33,138
They tend to go to most things they're invited to.

1091
01:40:34,479 --> 01:40:41,065
And then on the special ed program, the last part is there's approximately 142 students requiring the various services.

1092
01:40:41,505 --> 01:40:45,908
Do all 142 take advantage of these programs?

1093
01:40:46,709 --> 01:40:50,972
Well, again, this is part of what they're supposed to be doing on their IEPs.

1094
01:40:51,092 --> 01:40:54,115
I believe they get a pretty good attendance rate on that because

1095
01:40:54,733 --> 01:40:57,696
The parents want the kids to have the services during the summer.

1096
01:40:58,136 --> 01:41:06,725
So can I make a motion if Kathy could tell us what percent comes and if Trotter could tell us what percent comes to the... Sure.

1097
01:41:06,865 --> 01:41:11,369
Just maybe if they're not 100%, maybe there's a way to outreach more to get more people to them.

1098
01:41:11,690 --> 01:41:12,791
Okay.

1099
01:41:12,811 --> 01:41:14,473
So I will get the data on that.

1100
01:41:15,373 --> 01:41:16,194
Thank you very much.

1101
01:41:16,214 --> 01:41:17,315
You're welcome.

1102
01:41:17,395 --> 01:41:17,455
Ms.

1103
01:41:17,475 --> 01:41:17,956
Van de Kloot.

1104
01:41:19,597 --> 01:41:24,801
I just wanted to ask about the summer school program in terms of tuition.

1105
01:41:25,922 --> 01:41:32,907
For students who are on free or reduced lunch, you know, potentially if they fail two subjects, it's $500.

1106
01:41:32,987 --> 01:41:41,534
Do we have a reduced cost for students who are clearly economically disadvantaged?

1107
01:41:42,615 --> 01:41:46,277
We work with families who have special circumstances.

1108
01:41:46,358 --> 01:41:46,878
I know that.

1109
01:41:47,857 --> 01:41:53,200
Sometimes it's a payment plan, so they don't have to do all of the tuition up front.

1110
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:58,102
And I know there are times that we're very forgiving if the circumstances are such.

1111
01:41:58,162 --> 01:42:00,283
But we take it on an individual case.

1112
01:42:00,323 --> 01:42:06,926
To say that everyone gets free and reduced lunch, gets reduction in tuition is not what we're currently doing.

1113
01:42:06,966 --> 01:42:09,628
But we do obviously take that into consideration.

1114
01:42:09,648 --> 01:42:12,549
Okay, as long as I know that there's- We don't turn people away who need it.

1115
01:42:12,949 --> 01:42:13,970
Okay, thank you.

1116
01:42:14,876 --> 01:42:15,678
Mr. Benedetto.

1117
01:42:16,139 --> 01:42:16,560
Thank you.

1118
01:42:17,362 --> 01:42:22,715
My question is actually directed towards the mayor and it's in regard to the summer

1119
01:42:23,158 --> 01:42:26,920
Recreation book if that is when to print today.

1120
01:42:27,160 --> 01:42:41,808
Oh, that's our summer recreation has a litany of programming You know sports camps some of the programs that you have we have similar camps that are gonna be had and music camps There's quite a bit that's gonna be in the catalog and it went to print today So we're hoping to have it next week.

1121
01:42:42,069 --> 01:42:48,032
And where will they be available be distributing through the schools will be doing backpacks and it'll also be online and

1122
01:42:48,733 --> 01:42:52,597
Will there any be up at the library just in case people are down there.

1123
01:42:53,077 --> 01:42:53,938
Okay, great.

1124
01:42:54,059 --> 01:42:55,580
Thank you Yes

1125
01:42:57,412 --> 01:43:04,934
Whenever we discuss the summer fund program, I think I ought to give kudos to Ann Marie Cuno, our colleague, who really got it off the ground.

1126
01:43:05,615 --> 01:43:06,855
So, just want to mention that.

1127
01:43:07,495 --> 01:43:07,835
Very good.

1128
01:43:11,056 --> 01:43:11,276
Ms.

1129
01:43:11,316 --> 01:43:11,616
Krebs.

1130
01:43:11,636 --> 01:43:11,937
Thank you.

1131
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:12,777
Thank you for the report.

1132
01:43:13,117 --> 01:43:19,519
I just wanted to mention we were at the West Memphis Community Center the other day, and they're having a summer camp as well.

1133
01:43:20,019 --> 01:43:22,560
It's ten weeks, June 26th to September 1st.

1134
01:43:23,521 --> 01:43:29,863
8 AM to 6 PM, middle school, 6 to 8, and it's $1.75 a week.

1135
01:43:30,443 --> 01:43:32,064
And you only pay for the weeks you need.

1136
01:43:32,444 --> 01:43:33,524
So I just wanted to mention it.

1137
01:43:33,604 --> 01:43:37,685
And if anybody's interested, there's still spaces limited, but there's still space available.

1138
01:43:38,226 --> 01:43:38,606
Very good.

1139
01:43:38,626 --> 01:43:39,006
Thank you.

1140
01:43:39,286 --> 01:43:42,667
And they have a continuing after school program?

1141
01:43:42,727 --> 01:43:42,867
Yes.

1142
01:43:44,243 --> 01:43:44,643
Very good.

1143
01:43:44,683 --> 01:43:47,125
Is there a motion on the floor to receive and place on file?

1144
01:43:48,065 --> 01:43:48,206
Ms.

1145
01:43:48,226 --> 01:43:49,246
Van de Kloet has a question.

1146
01:43:49,466 --> 01:43:56,291
No, I just noticed that in the form, it says that the summer fund program runs 7.30 PM to 4.30 PM.

1147
01:43:56,631 --> 01:43:57,832
It just needs to be corrected.

1148
01:43:58,612 --> 01:43:59,893
Just in the report.

1149
01:44:00,413 --> 01:44:00,653
Thanks.

1150
01:44:02,134 --> 01:44:02,635
Eagle eyes.

1151
01:44:04,496 --> 01:44:05,256
Very good.

1152
01:44:06,177 --> 01:44:06,677
Backwards.

1153
01:44:06,817 --> 01:44:07,518
Back to the future.

1154
01:44:07,538 --> 01:44:09,779
There's a motion for approval offered by Ms.

1155
01:44:09,799 --> 01:44:10,960
Van de Kloet, seconded by Ms.

1156
01:44:10,980 --> 01:44:11,320
Cuno.

1157
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:12,101
All those in favor?

1158
01:44:12,121 --> 01:44:12,541
Aye.

1159
01:44:13,101 --> 01:44:13,882
All those opposed?

1160
01:44:14,773 --> 01:44:16,434
Papers received and placed on file.

1161
01:44:17,234 --> 01:44:22,016
And our final report on English language learners newcomers program redistribution.

1162
01:44:22,036 --> 01:44:23,237
Mr. Superintendent.

1163
01:44:23,977 --> 01:44:32,240
So one of the discussions we've had recently is the concentration of students who are ELL in any one elementary school.

1164
01:44:33,261 --> 01:44:40,164
And the newcomers program has historically been at the Roberts, but the numbers have become very substantial.

1165
01:44:40,824 --> 01:44:43,305
And one of the discussions that we had was how can we

1166
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:46,761
spread them out, redistribute them a little bit more.

1167
01:44:46,801 --> 01:44:55,546
In earlier discussions, we talked about splitting, let's say, grades 1 and 2 at one school and 3, 4, and 5 at another.

1168
01:44:56,146 --> 01:45:06,691
And so this particular report tells you that next year it's our plan to send grades 1 and 2 to the Brooks School for two reasons.

1169
01:45:06,851 --> 01:45:11,814
One, it will redistribute the newcomers program, not all ELL students, but the newcomers program.

1170
01:45:12,654 --> 01:45:14,155
And also, it will create more

1171
01:45:14,685 --> 01:45:20,668
of a balance between the two schools because the population at the Brooks is lower than the population at the Roberts.

1172
01:45:21,128 --> 01:45:30,013
Put the two together, they'll come up with a similar population and the diversity level at the Brooks will increase substantially and that will be helpful as well.

1173
01:45:30,613 --> 01:45:35,516
So that's our goal, that's what we're doing and we plan to move ahead unless there's an objection.

1174
01:45:38,228 --> 01:45:39,148
Do you have any questions, miss?

1175
01:45:39,408 --> 01:45:39,568
No?

1176
01:45:40,208 --> 01:45:40,528
You're good?

1177
01:45:41,589 --> 01:45:42,069
Very good.

1178
01:45:42,909 --> 01:45:43,709
Mr. Benedetto.

1179
01:45:44,369 --> 01:45:49,090
I think this is a great idea, Mr. Superintendent.

1180
01:45:51,711 --> 01:46:01,972
There has been significant parent presence at some of our meetings worried about the class size and where space was available at our schools.

1181
01:46:02,452 --> 01:46:05,133
And I really believe that this is a really

1182
01:46:05,554 --> 01:46:06,975
good way to look at this.

1183
01:46:07,055 --> 01:46:11,358
And we can watch it closely next year and make any other adjustments.

1184
01:46:11,798 --> 01:46:26,547
All that I ask is if it does cause hardships to individual families, that you take that into account and work with those families and make sure that the transition works well for those families.

1185
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:35,033
And if there's great hardship of separating siblings, you keep that in mind when placement is necessary.

1186
01:46:36,267 --> 01:46:39,608
I think it's very important for us to maybe make a statement at this point in time.

1187
01:46:40,548 --> 01:46:42,229
We talked about this the other night at the middle schools.

1188
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:46,571
We can't make everybody happy all the time.

1189
01:46:47,271 --> 01:46:53,333
There's going to be decisions that are going to be made that are going to require people to accept certain kinds of things for distribution purposes.

1190
01:46:54,019 --> 01:47:07,443
Now this year we'll do it with the elementary, but as we go into next year we're going to have to take a very strong look at the middle school and redistribute students because otherwise one school will be very heavy with certain types of students who require certain services.

1191
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:13,425
Other schools will be less populated and have other challenges.

1192
01:47:13,866 --> 01:47:16,466
So people ask for certain things.

1193
01:47:16,546 --> 01:47:18,047
We do our best to accommodate them.

1194
01:47:18,457 --> 01:47:26,520
From time to time, we have to make a decision, and not everybody's going to be happy with that decision, but that's the nature of trying to be fair to everybody.

1195
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:37,484
And sometimes in transition, there are a few people that feel like we didn't consider their particular situation, but we'll try to consider as many situations as we can.

1196
01:47:39,683 --> 01:47:40,083
Very good.

1197
01:47:40,183 --> 01:47:40,423
Ms.

1198
01:47:40,944 --> 01:47:41,424
Van de Kloot.

1199
01:47:41,844 --> 01:47:47,487
I think my biggest concern is sometimes older students are in charge of looking after younger siblings.

1200
01:47:47,807 --> 01:47:57,653
And by splitting the families between two schools, which I certainly understand why we're moving in that direction, that could create some issues.

1201
01:47:58,572 --> 01:48:01,273
And that's the place that I'm most concerned about.

1202
01:48:01,993 --> 01:48:11,636
And there may be some interesting and creative solutions to that for families, but I think that we just need to be very, very well aware of.

1203
01:48:12,256 --> 01:48:19,638
And most importantly is the information to the families so we're aware of any, you know, real problems ahead of time.

1204
01:48:20,298 --> 01:48:27,300
One of the things we'll do after tonight is we'll actually reach out to the families that will be affected by school transitions this week.

1205
01:48:28,058 --> 01:48:30,419
and start to let them know what our plans are.

1206
01:48:30,999 --> 01:48:39,500
And then we do have after school programs and other things like that that we can work out some arrangements for people who have particular needs that really are under stress.

1207
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:51,283
But we've got to be very careful that we don't just assume that everybody is going to get everything that they want because if we do that, we give ourselves an unbearable goal, an unattainable goal.

1208
01:48:51,823 --> 01:48:54,223
So from time to time, you make a decision.

1209
01:48:54,243 --> 01:48:56,784
You do it in the vast majority of people involved.

1210
01:48:57,207 --> 01:49:01,109
You try to work on the edges with the people that may be affected adversely.

1211
01:49:01,870 --> 01:49:06,072
Could you address what happens in third grade when they've finished, let's say, a second grade newcomer?

1212
01:49:06,353 --> 01:49:08,574
Hopefully by third grade they're no longer a newcomer.

1213
01:49:08,594 --> 01:49:09,114
Correct.

1214
01:49:09,274 --> 01:49:12,977
So they can go back to their school of origin or their geographical school.

1215
01:49:13,017 --> 01:49:14,718
And they'll have a preference in that transfer?

1216
01:49:14,758 --> 01:49:14,978
Right.

1217
01:49:15,518 --> 01:49:17,179
They would go back to their school of origin.

1218
01:49:17,199 --> 01:49:20,561
So the goal is to get them out of the newcomers program as soon as possible.

1219
01:49:20,581 --> 01:49:21,502
A couple years should do it.

1220
01:49:22,711 --> 01:49:25,832
And that would hope that they wouldn't have to go to the Roberts.

1221
01:49:25,852 --> 01:49:27,172
They could go back to the School of Archer.

1222
01:49:28,352 --> 01:49:28,872
OK?

1223
01:49:28,932 --> 01:49:29,272
Very good.

1224
01:49:31,153 --> 01:49:31,453
All set?

1225
01:49:31,873 --> 01:49:32,953
Mm-hmm.

1226
01:49:32,973 --> 01:49:33,013
Ms.

1227
01:49:33,053 --> 01:49:33,393
Cuneo.

1228
01:49:34,053 --> 01:49:34,814
That was my question.

1229
01:49:34,834 --> 01:49:35,534
You good?

1230
01:49:35,634 --> 01:49:36,054
OK.

1231
01:49:36,674 --> 01:49:37,034
All righty.

1232
01:49:37,054 --> 01:49:39,375
Is there a motion to receive and place on file?

1233
01:49:39,395 --> 01:49:40,535
Mr. Scarry made the motion.

1234
01:49:40,575 --> 01:49:41,775
Is there a second by Ms.

1235
01:49:41,795 --> 01:49:42,395
Van de Kloot?

1236
01:49:42,475 --> 01:49:43,175
All those in favor?

1237
01:49:43,195 --> 01:49:43,255
Aye.

1238
01:49:43,856 --> 01:49:44,536
All those opposed?

1239
01:49:44,596 --> 01:49:45,376
Motion passes.

1240
01:49:45,616 --> 01:49:46,856
Mayor, just a couple of announcements.

1241
01:49:46,896 --> 01:49:48,837
I'm taking those no negotiating legal matters.

1242
01:49:48,857 --> 01:49:49,037
No.

1243
01:49:49,077 --> 01:49:50,577
We have one item of new business.

1244
01:49:51,017 --> 01:49:55,804
Be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Reverend Edward Doughty.

1245
01:49:56,164 --> 01:49:58,528
Father Ed was the pastor of the Collaboration of St.

1246
01:49:58,568 --> 01:49:59,409
Francis and St.

1247
01:49:59,449 --> 01:50:00,891
Joseph Churches in Medford.

1248
01:50:00,911 --> 01:50:05,738
If you could all please rise for a moment of silence on the passing of Reverend Father Doughty.

1249
01:50:16,504 --> 01:50:17,625
and a couple of announcements.

1250
01:50:17,645 --> 01:50:22,829
So on Wednesday evening last, you asked me for some dates, and I gave you the wrong dates a couple of days later.

1251
01:50:22,849 --> 01:50:24,850
Yeah, graduation.

1252
01:50:26,311 --> 01:50:31,575
And I just wanted to say what I wanted to see was just how attentive you are to what I send out.

1253
01:50:32,055 --> 01:50:34,617
And Kathy was the only one who picked it up, so sorry about that.

1254
01:50:35,117 --> 01:50:36,739
The rest of you just weren't paying attention.

1255
01:50:36,759 --> 01:50:37,259
No, I'm just kidding.

1256
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:39,681
So I've given you corrected dates.

1257
01:50:40,942 --> 01:50:45,405
June 6 is the Curtis Tufts graduation, 1130 at the Irish American.

1258
01:50:46,714 --> 01:50:47,635
11, now 11 o'clock?

1259
01:50:47,735 --> 01:50:49,957
Okay.

1260
01:50:50,117 --> 01:50:50,837
This says 11.30.

1261
01:50:53,019 --> 01:50:53,980
It's now 11 o'clock.

1262
01:50:54,440 --> 01:50:55,001
Okay.

1263
01:50:55,021 --> 01:50:55,941
11 o'clock, okay.

1264
01:50:56,982 --> 01:50:58,783
I was looking at, what is it?

1265
01:50:58,823 --> 01:50:59,224
Okay.

1266
01:50:59,244 --> 01:50:59,564
11 o'clock.

1267
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:02,506
If you get there half an hour later, you'll be there in time for the food.

1268
01:51:02,987 --> 01:51:03,227
Okay.

1269
01:51:04,508 --> 01:51:09,972
The M Club banquet is on June 6th in the evening and graduation is on the 7th.

1270
01:51:10,492 --> 01:51:10,833
Okay?

1271
01:51:11,663 --> 01:51:16,064
A couple of other things, we have a meeting this Wednesday evening to interview ELL candidates.

1272
01:51:17,244 --> 01:51:22,005
I have at least three candidates, good candidates for you to see, possibly a fourth by tomorrow.

1273
01:51:22,365 --> 01:51:24,885
We'll make sure we check out a couple of references.

1274
01:51:25,746 --> 01:51:28,086
And that's Wednesday starting at 7.

1275
01:51:29,406 --> 01:51:38,368
We've reserved the 22nd and the 25th for additional meetings, possibly for community schools or for other situations, and also possibly

1276
01:51:38,987 --> 01:51:42,468
to interview the candidates for the vocational director's principal's job.

1277
01:51:43,128 --> 01:51:45,889
I'm still going through applications, talking to references.

1278
01:51:45,929 --> 01:51:58,212
There's some things happening out there in that type of community, the vocational director's community, that may portend for us to postpone that and move it a little bit further out to get all the candidates that I want to have in the pool.

1279
01:51:58,652 --> 01:51:59,332
But we'll see that.

1280
01:51:59,392 --> 01:52:00,833
I'll know that better in the next week or so.

1281
01:52:04,185 --> 01:52:11,931
In addition to that, I think that you should know that the Senate is coming out with its Ways and Means budget tomorrow.

1282
01:52:12,292 --> 01:52:21,179
That gives us a better idea of what the Senate is proposing versus what the House is proposing and what we might be looking at for state funding and budgets.

1283
01:52:21,219 --> 01:52:27,824
We're still looking at federal dollars as they get sifted around when reports from the federal government.

1284
01:52:27,844 --> 01:52:31,967
So all those things have an impact on you, and I just want to make sure you're aware of it.

1285
01:52:31,987 --> 01:52:32,568
Mr. Benedetto.

1286
01:52:33,105 --> 01:52:39,610
Thank you for those updates, Superintendent Felsen, through Madam Maber.

1287
01:52:39,670 --> 01:52:41,131
Don't say that word.

1288
01:52:41,211 --> 01:52:41,552
I know.

1289
01:52:41,572 --> 01:52:43,353
I'm picking up your habit.

1290
01:52:45,655 --> 01:52:53,481
So we haven't discussed, as the chairperson of the school committee, we haven't discussed the superintendent's review, his annual review.

1291
01:52:53,881 --> 01:53:01,427
So I'm requesting that you start that process through you for the superintendent's annual review.

1292
01:53:02,607 --> 01:53:07,349
so we can have that before the end of our session, before summer break.

1293
01:53:08,309 --> 01:53:15,732
So I would like to move forward on making sure that we do our due diligence as a committee and do his annual review.

1294
01:53:16,152 --> 01:53:16,552
Thank you.

1295
01:53:17,652 --> 01:53:17,852
Ms.

1296
01:53:17,872 --> 01:53:19,373
Cuneo, did you have a comment?

1297
01:53:19,613 --> 01:53:19,693
Yes.

1298
01:53:19,713 --> 01:53:24,415
I just want to know if we have any dates of the budget itself.

1299
01:53:24,855 --> 01:53:25,215
Not yet.

1300
01:53:25,235 --> 01:53:29,336
All righty.

1301
01:53:29,997 --> 01:53:30,897
Motion to adjourn.
