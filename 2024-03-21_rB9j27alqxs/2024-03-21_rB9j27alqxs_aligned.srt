1
00:00:08,244 --> 00:00:09,444
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

2
00:00:10,085 --> 00:00:24,568
My name is Dr. Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Schools, and I'm going to read the agenda, and then I will hand it off to our Student Advisory Committee as we head into the topics for discussion, as well as members of the School Committee.

3
00:00:24,588 --> 00:00:36,831
So please be advised that on March 20th, 2024, at 2.30 p.m., there will be a Student Advisory Council meeting of the Medford School Committee held at the Medford High School in the Superintendent's Conference Room and via remote participation.

4
00:00:37,489 --> 00:00:41,833
The meeting can be viewed through Medford Community Media on Comcast and Verizon.

5
00:00:42,253 --> 00:00:46,477
Participants can join the meeting in person or remotely by using the following information.

6
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:53,684
Medford Public Schools invites you to join a meeting with remote participation option and the Zoom link provided with meeting ID number 93394711986.

7
00:00:53,724 --> 00:00:55,606
We are also broadcasting to the district's YouTube channel.

8
00:01:02,018 --> 00:01:12,267
Um, and the agenda for this afternoon is a roll call for attendance of members and student representatives, which I will defer to number, um, yourself for that.

9
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:24,278
Uh, and then the rest of the agenda is introduction of new committee member, John Toppa, uh, topics for discussion, backpacks, homework, policy, transportation, student voice, flow chart.

10
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:28,862
Uh, I also believe it would probably be appropriate where neither the chair or the vice chair here,

11
00:01:29,258 --> 00:01:33,540
that I do turn over the meeting to member Rousseau as the secretary.

12
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,423
Um, so which I have, well, thank you.

13
00:01:39,443 --> 00:01:40,243
Hi everybody.

14
00:01:40,824 --> 00:01:43,505
Um, you already read all this, right?

15
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,006
Just have to do role in attendance.

16
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:51,289
So if the lack of order, but since I didn't write it down, I'm going to just read off the screen.

17
00:01:51,589 --> 00:01:53,470
Um, and we're right now present.

18
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:56,211
Remember in Tapa present.

19
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:58,512
I'm all about a present.

20
00:01:59,454 --> 00:02:00,915
We're so present or present.

21
00:02:01,195 --> 00:02:02,055
We have a quorum.

22
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:02,955
Thank you everyone.

23
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:10,578
So we have a new member, whichever some of you may have already been watching other meetings.

24
00:02:10,658 --> 00:02:14,680
I remember a topic is, um, new as of exactly that date.

25
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,341
Um, so these meetings, which are, um, and so I think it makes sense if everybody,

26
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:30,431
on the table and everybody can just introduce themselves.

27
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:41,279
I've already done that so.

28
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:42,419
Hi, good afternoon.

29
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:46,622

Thank you.

37
00:03:13,183 --> 00:03:34,621
I'm Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent, Superintendent of Schools, and I wanted to say, Member Rousseau, that all of our members on Zoom today are brand new members, effective January, so please, Member Reinfeldt, Member Olopade, and Member Ntapa, introduce yourselves to this wonderful group of students.

38
00:03:40,526 --> 00:03:43,568
All right, I guess we'll go in the order that you called us.

39
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:46,229
So hi everyone, I'm Erika Reinfeld.

40
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:50,151
I am talking to you right now from MIT.

41
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:52,132
I teach science communication here.

42
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:53,393
I've worked in a lot of museums.

43
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:56,535
I have background in astronomy and theater and museum education.

44
00:03:57,615 --> 00:03:58,676
all of the disciplines.

45
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,916
I am interested in that.

46
00:04:00,377 --> 00:04:01,797
I'm also a Medford mom.

47
00:04:01,897 --> 00:04:10,642
I have a seventh grader and a third grader, and I am very excited about having all of these voices in our conversations about what our schools are going to look like in the future.

48
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:17,706
So thank you for taking up time after school to be a part of this council.

49
00:04:17,806 --> 00:04:24,769
It is amazingly appreciated by us on the committee and also by your fellow students and teachers and administrators.

50
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:25,730
So thank you so much.

51
00:04:31,268 --> 00:04:34,812
Uh, I can't tell if they can hear us because they were waving their hands.

52
00:04:35,092 --> 00:04:35,593
Can you hear us?

53
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:38,356
All right, cool.

54
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:39,497
I think I can see a thumbs up.

55
00:04:39,577 --> 00:04:40,118
Hi, everybody.

56
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:41,319
My name is Aaron Olopade.

57
00:04:41,339 --> 00:04:45,723
I'm newly elected as like, like, uh, the thumb was down.

58
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:46,584
It's really far away.

59
00:04:46,624 --> 00:04:46,945
I know.

60
00:04:47,005 --> 00:04:47,785
Yeah.

61
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:47,906
Hmm.

62
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:58,920
Let me run across the hall quickly, and then I'll come right back.

63
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,965
OK, so we have been having, unfortunately, the Zoom Room software has just crashed on us.

64
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:09,608
Give me one second here to unmute my computer.

65
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:13,891
And can you hear us now?

66
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:14,331
Thumbs up.

67
00:05:15,973 --> 00:05:16,774
All right, perfect.

68
00:05:17,854 --> 00:05:24,178
Member Reinfeld, whatever you were saying, I'm sure it was, if you could repeat, but I don't know if it was anything.

69
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:29,181
All right, well, let me, can you hear me before I go on?

70
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:29,822
Can you hear me?

71
00:05:32,423 --> 00:05:32,924
That's a yes.

72
00:05:33,965 --> 00:05:34,445
Excellent.

73
00:05:34,686 --> 00:05:35,246
Oh, hello there.

74
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:36,086
All right.

75
00:05:36,247 --> 00:05:38,548
So again, I am Erica Reinfeld.

76
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:49,736
I am talking to you from MIT today where I teach science communication, but I have also worked in museums for the Smithsonian and for MIT's Cancer Research Center.

77
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:52,698
I have a background in astronomy and theater and museum education.

78
00:05:52,778 --> 00:05:55,399
So I am about all of the things that you study.

79
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:55,820
I am

80
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:06,747
so excited about the curriculum components, and I am so grateful to all of you for volunteering your time to be on a part of the school committee in a student advisory capacity.

81
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:08,188
I'm also a Medford mom.

82
00:06:08,448 --> 00:06:18,014
I have a seventh grader and a third grader, and I just really appreciate this, and I know your classmates, your teachers, the rest of the committee does as well.

83
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:21,993
Hi, everybody.

84
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:23,194
My name is Aaron Olopade.

85
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:25,596
Like the superintendent mentioned, we are all newly elected.

86
00:06:25,636 --> 00:06:26,657
So I'm really excited to be here.

87
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,458
I'm a Medford High graduate of 2018.

88
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:35,364
So about five years ago, and I'm a recent graduate of Boston College this past May, studying political science.

89
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:42,990
So law, politics, government are my main focuses when it comes to academics, but I have interest in a majority of the subjects as well.

90
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,113
So I'm excited to kind of get involved and be invested in your success.

91
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,394
And thank you so much for having me here.

92
00:06:51,365 --> 00:06:53,788
Hi everyone, hopefully you can hear me all right.

93
00:06:53,808 --> 00:06:56,931
I've been having some mic issues, but my name is john and tapa.

94
00:06:57,331 --> 00:07:07,061
I am a also a recent grad of Medford high graduated in 2019 I also served as the class president of the class of 2019 so the senior class president.

95
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:13,788
I just graduated also in May from the Massachusetts College of Art and Design and Industrial Design.

96
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:18,031
which is all basically product design, toy design, medical design, you name it.

97
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:20,133
Also, informational flowcharts.

98
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:26,161
So, Darren Truong, really appreciate the graphic you have made for us that we will look at later in the agenda.

99
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:27,963
But that's what I'm all about.

100
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:32,718
My work, I work at MassArt now and I work in student engagement.

101
00:07:33,558 --> 00:07:41,303
While I was a student at MassArt, I also served as the student trustee for a year and a half, and then the student body president for another two years.

102
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:48,348
So, for the last nearly decade my work has been in student advocacy and student success.

103
00:07:49,534 --> 00:08:03,422
So I'm really interested in working with y'all and treating y'all as a member of the table, because that's what I fought so hard for at MassArt, pulling the students out of the pandemic, because I was a freshman first year when the pandemic hit.

104
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:09,106
So really excited to work with y'all, because that's what my background is all about.

105
00:08:10,366 --> 00:08:14,769
So thank you for taking the time to be with us and join this really important committee.

106
00:08:20,347 --> 00:08:22,920
All right.

107
00:08:23,578 --> 00:08:26,179
know who the superintendent is.

108
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,160
Yes, I'm not sure if you heard me, but Dr. Marie Sedgwick-Vinson, superintendent of schools.

109
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,121
I did pop in to say hi, and I just was taking it from this office here.

110
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:41,562
Thank you again to all of you for volunteering and being part of this great group.

111
00:08:41,902 --> 00:08:42,722
Thank you, Ms.

112
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:47,663
Greatest-Haley, for also being the administrator representing all of our high school students.

113
00:08:47,723 --> 00:08:52,204
We truly appreciate your contributions to this special grouping.

114
00:08:52,964 --> 00:08:53,284
Thank you.

115
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,631
Darren, do you want to start over?

116
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:20,843
Yeah, so would it be possible to move the... So the student advisory committee has been working alongside the site council and we're working on getting a petition out to the students at Medford High School regarding a backpack policy as the students have expressed that they want the current backpack policy repealed.

117
00:09:21,303 --> 00:09:22,243
So we've just been collecting

118
00:09:23,703 --> 00:09:28,454
signatures for that petition so we can present on Tuesday at the site council meeting.

119
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:31,260
Yeah, that's pretty much it on the backpack.

120
00:09:31,581 --> 00:09:31,821
Awesome.

121
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:43,763
There was one thing about backpacks has been, of course, very centered around the school, obviously, school policy, not so much around the school committee level.

122
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:52,248
But we were told at one point that there was maybe some kind of discussion on the school committee level about it, or maybe there was like some kind of walkthrough.

123
00:09:52,328 --> 00:09:55,029
I wasn't sure exactly what it said.

124
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:57,050
At some point, backpacks were discussed.

125
00:09:58,031 --> 00:10:00,832
And I wasn't sure exactly the contents of that discussion.

126
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:09,354
If I remember correctly, backpacks may have been discussed as part of the dress code, but I don't, I might be off on that.

127
00:10:09,754 --> 00:10:10,414
Yeah.

128
00:10:10,935 --> 00:10:13,776
You know, we didn't address that specifically in the dress code.

129
00:10:13,796 --> 00:10:15,997
I think it was brought up as something to consider.

130
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:20,300
And it was kind of like, are we going to boil the ocean or are we going to actually get the dress code part done?

131
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,581
So we didn't go there.

132
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:28,244
I believe just before the pandemic, there was conversation around the backpack policy,

133
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:37,472
like many things that were happening when the actual pandemic began, we just forgot about everything because that wasn't what mattered anymore.

134
00:10:38,753 --> 00:10:47,899
And I believe before I was even on the committee, this is my seventh year, that that was a major issue that had been discussed by others.

135
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:53,443
But I wasn't in high school then, I was here and I didn't have a kid here.

136
00:10:54,143 --> 00:10:56,645
And so I don't know how that conversation went.

137
00:10:57,409 --> 00:11:02,654
If there was any dialogue about it, I feel like at this point, everybody's new and doesn't even know what that was.

138
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:16,526
Although John and Aaron may actually remember it, but it feels like we should just have whatever that conversation is again, because we're all gonna need to go up speed on whatever that was.

139
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:23,852
And things may be different now anyways, because before the pandemic, we didn't have a school issued device.

140
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,521
things were technically different as well.

141
00:11:28,682 --> 00:11:30,783
So that's just my thoughts.

142
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:46,673
If I could chime in, because I remember if I'm correct, if the students can correct me, the current policy is there's a square chart in front of every door that says the bag can't be bigger than this, that you're allowed to carry around.

143
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:47,734
Is that still the policy?

144
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:49,835
Because that's how it was in 2019.

145
00:11:49,955 --> 00:11:54,118
I've seen one teacher have that box.

146
00:11:55,234 --> 00:12:08,845
Yeah, because I know the struggle like I when I was a seat when I was there, my floor was C2 and even C2 to be 3 was kind of crazy between classes with the 3 minute a lot of time.

147
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:12,788
And I can't even imagine what the class below us, which I think was C1, I think 2020 class was C1 or C3.

148
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:34,279
Because I know that's where the struggle was always talked about was with transporting stuff but now it's member or so as mentioned with most students having school issue devices like the Chromebooks, it's, it's an issue of carrying so many objects but also the fragility of if you drop that you're going to get charged if it breaks.

149
00:12:34,719 --> 00:12:37,641
So I think it definitely would be worth having a discussion, especially with students.

150
00:12:40,117 --> 00:13:02,299
especially making sure we have students who know that experience of getting from, again, dramatically from C1 to B3, seeing what that is like and where the struggles are and if we need to, how big we need to expand that policy or if we need to talk about just regular backpacks or if we, you know, I think the allocated size is only

151
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,768
It's like eight by 24.

152
00:13:07,068 --> 00:13:12,772
It's some weird like basic purse size, I think, if I remember correctly.

153
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:28,463
So it definitely would be worth, again, because of the new added responsibility of maintaining that piece of technology, it would be definitely worth relooking at in terms of making sure that that can be done safely and effectively.

154
00:13:34,073 --> 00:13:38,298
So I would be interested, as a note, as a petition.

155
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:47,189
Also, like with an added element of the petition to see student comments specifically about what their specific struggles are so we can self identify right off the bat, too.

156
00:13:47,209 --> 00:13:53,196
So when that petition goes out, I'd be I'd be curious to see what the specific needs are.

157
00:13:53,959 --> 00:14:00,745
Because I don't want to try to solve a problem that no one has and waste so much energy on something that's like, no, we don't have this issue.

158
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:05,609
It'd be great to see what, like to hear from y'all what that is specifically.

159
00:14:06,589 --> 00:14:08,651
Is it timing that's causing the issue?

160
00:14:08,871 --> 00:14:12,194
Is it amount of stuff you have to hold?

161
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:18,940
It may be evident, but I would like to know specifically just so that way we can work efficiently.

162
00:14:19,676 --> 00:14:27,343
to design a solution to this issue that you guys are facing to the point where a petition does have to go out and we do have to have this conversation.

163
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:36,208
And I think the other part that needs to be a part of the conversation is understanding some of the motivation for why the policy exists.

164
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:42,652
Cause I've, I've heard certainly some concerns around, you know, is this, are we just talking about backpacks, but what about large totes?

165
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:51,456
And there are some equity issues where some student populations are more likely to carry a large tote and some are more likely to carry backpacks and are those being treated the same way.

166
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:55,858
But is this about the devices that can distract people in class?

167
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:56,419
And so this is,

168
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:00,381
an opportunity to not have those devices.

169
00:15:00,621 --> 00:15:06,845
And so how can we make sure that a new policy solves the problems that the initial policy was intended to have?

170
00:15:07,546 --> 00:15:09,067
So I think that's the other component.

171
00:15:09,787 --> 00:15:21,733
We see the burden that the policy can place on students, but then taking that away, what are the consequences of that for being in class, for being between classes?

172
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,835
I think there are different concerns during passing than there are in class.

173
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:33,779
So just making sure that conversation includes not just the impact on students, but on the entire class.

174
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:54,421
But what I've heard this is just from like my talking with the teachers every now and then the biggest concern that I know of is like just sort of being a clutter either in the hallways or like on by the side of the desk because obviously you want to keep keep walkways clear if you're like saying.

175
00:15:55,502 --> 00:15:58,903
In a lab, you want to keep yourself away from any chemicals you're using, anything like that.

176
00:15:59,564 --> 00:16:06,926
And so what we kind of thought was a reasonable sort of limit on that would be like just being able to fit it under the desks.

177
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:10,248
There's sort of like a standardized desk that we've used for quite some time.

178
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:12,929
And there is a spot under that desk to put materials.

179
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:19,271
So it would make sense if you could just fit your backpack in there, then it would fulfill the same purpose of just putting your supplies there.

180
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:23,693
And it would still allow kids to carry around stuff and also still keep the walkways clear.

181
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:26,305
Yes.

182
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:31,488
Thank you.

183
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:42,693
I guess I can speak to that.

184
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:54,425
So for the petition, we currently have roughly 130 signatures, and that's been roughly like a week we've been collecting signatures.

185
00:16:55,826 --> 00:16:59,188
However, it's like we're also short on people, so it takes time to collect signatures.

186
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:12,195
As of currently, the petition, it's only a signature, and it doesn't have like an option for input, so we would likely have sent out another survey with specific options for input for students to

187
00:17:12,975 --> 00:17:16,301
be able to put in their suggestions or concerns regarding the backpack also.

188
00:17:17,322 --> 00:17:17,483
Yeah.

189
00:17:18,063 --> 00:17:24,354
Well, like just going around for petition, a large problem that I see with students is like the amount of stuff they have to carry because

190
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:32,836
a while back ago, like kind of accommodate the backpack policy, there was like these, like kind of like knapsacks handed out, like a little drawstring bag you can use.

191
00:17:33,216 --> 00:17:40,981
But while I can like fit different folders and stuff, the issue like the big binders we have to carry like the one and a half inch, the green binders that we have to carry in between classes.

192
00:17:41,882 --> 00:17:53,930
And like the timing, going in between classes, like it gets worse, like when you need to go from like D3 to like C1, for example, or like across, up the stairs, across hallways and stuff, like

193
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:58,174
The timing kind of just adds on to the struggle of trying to carry all those binders.

194
00:17:58,274 --> 00:18:03,335
I have to carry a bunch of binders between my classes, and you're always trying to make sure, oh, you don't drop it, for example.

195
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:07,095
And you're trying to get by in the thin staircases, too.

196
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:12,036
And you're carrying all that stuff, and it's kind of hard to try and navigate that getting by.

197
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:22,678
So being able to at least have some tote bag or backpack that can carry all that stuff in a more condensed manner would then facilitate that transportation.

198
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:30,551
Yeah, sounds like you all have a fairly good idea of the issues and the reasons that we want this.

199
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:48,718
So I wonder if rather than doing another survey, you might think about once we, you have a proposal for what this would look like, asking people to respond to that specific proposal rather than having another open-ended feedback that comes in, but make it more of a feedback than an input response situation.

200
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,680
I'd say here's what we think would solve the problems we know about, what have we forgotten?

201
00:19:00,854 --> 00:19:18,150
Could another, you know, we talked about informational hierarchy and informational services would another element of this of the interest of the students would be of, I hate to use the word life hacks but other suggested ways of cutting down time between classes of like past precedents of what other students have found effective.

202
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:33,801
Like, I know that doesn't, it's not meant to be proposed as a cop-out of reforming the policy, but in addition to looking at the policy, would students find it helpful for there to be some kind of information on what other, you know, students, alumni have found effective to go between?

203
00:19:33,842 --> 00:19:47,532
Like, I know for me, my cheat was that I always had my locker set to the first two, and then I could set it to the third and pull it and go, which isn't the safest option sometimes, and I learned it from a TV show on Nickelodeon when I was eight.

204
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:49,472
And that's the classified.

205
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:57,814
But something like that where it's like where people find opportune times in their schedule, where people, because once I had a rhythm going, I knew what to do.

206
00:19:58,054 --> 00:20:02,074
But that was bestowed upon me by another peer.

207
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:09,716
So if they don't have that, so would an informational suggestion be of other usage to the students, essentially?

208
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,816
In addition to re-looking at the policy.

209
00:20:11,896 --> 00:20:13,496
But I wouldn't want to exclude that.

210
00:20:14,656 --> 00:20:16,657
Informational sharing is a beautiful thing.

211
00:20:18,823 --> 00:20:20,752
Just curious if that would be of interest as well.

212
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:24,855
I guess I can speak from a personal perspective.

213
00:20:26,036 --> 00:20:27,977
We as students, we get three minutes passing time.

214
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:38,403
So between getting from class to class and in the hallways, there's quite literally this traffic, because sometimes you have people blocking the entire hallway, and you can't get past them.

215
00:20:38,423 --> 00:20:39,203
And that makes us late.

216
00:20:39,563 --> 00:20:45,627
So if we add on trying to get to our lockers in between classes, it makes it very difficult for us to get our materials.

217
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:51,370
Or if we forget something, personally, what I do is I just get all my classes or materials that I need

218
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,731
up to lunch, and then I go during lunch.

219
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:58,993
But then there's another issue, which technically during lunch, we're not supposed to leave the CAF after 10 minutes.

220
00:20:59,413 --> 00:21:05,575
So if you factor in getting your lunch and waiting in the lunch line, then we're technically not supposed to leave the CAF.

221
00:21:06,995 --> 00:21:08,616
But yeah, that's just from personal experience.

222
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:11,297
But I haven't been stopped from leaving the CAF.

223
00:21:11,991 --> 00:21:16,372
So I don't, I don't think, I think it's just a rule that's like there, but it's not enforced in my personal experience.

224
00:21:16,712 --> 00:21:16,832
Yeah.

225
00:21:16,852 --> 00:21:22,313
I think in the schedule, it was like a five minute time period between third period and like four periods.

226
00:21:22,353 --> 00:21:25,574
Last one was like supposed to give us time to like go to our lockers and stuff.

227
00:21:25,594 --> 00:21:33,055
But like, depending on where your classes, like that might not exactly really help, but I think that's there to try and accommodate for that.

228
00:21:36,256 --> 00:21:36,956
No, that makes sense.

229
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:37,656
Thank you for sharing.

230
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:52,586
So we're going to be shifting to the homework policy, if there are no other questions or anything.

231
00:21:53,627 --> 00:21:56,828
Would it be possible, Dr. Cushing, to stream the Google Doc?

232
00:21:57,129 --> 00:21:57,469
Sure.

233
00:21:58,809 --> 00:21:59,290
Are you on?

234
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:01,571
Would you like to just share your screen?

235
00:22:03,331 --> 00:22:04,212
Whichever is easier.

236
00:22:04,252 --> 00:22:05,552
I also shared it with you as well.

237
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:16,696
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

238
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:23,598
My name is Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent of schools, and I'm going to read the agenda and then I will hang up.

239
00:22:24,138 --> 00:22:27,539
We are having a host of technical issues.

240
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,319
I apologize for anyone who didn't hear that anywhere.

241
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:35,340
As far as the recording, we'll have that.

242
00:22:44,201 --> 00:22:44,521
Sorry.

243
00:22:48,222 --> 00:22:54,063
If this is the if this is the same Google Doc that was shared in the last meeting, I believe I have that.

244
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:58,443
Yes, actually, member, if you could share, that would be great.

245
00:22:59,344 --> 00:23:01,684
It's a different one.

246
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:01,944
All right.

247
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,004
Let me share that right now.

248
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:08,145
And yeah, this would be great because we do have feedback on it.

249
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:13,006
Sorry, am I sharing the one that that we had last time?

250
00:23:14,295 --> 00:23:15,016
We have a different one.

251
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:15,676
Okay.

252
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,601
Close that window.

253
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,144
Sharing screen.

254
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:31,931
All right.

255
00:23:32,752 --> 00:23:39,999
And I'd ask any of you, if you would like to provide some feedback, like member Russo, we would love to see that.

256
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:51,354
I actually, I don't think you can have more.

257
00:23:51,594 --> 00:23:53,075
Okay.

258
00:23:53,355 --> 00:23:55,036
Okay.

259
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:56,877
You can take another two of them.

260
00:23:57,157 --> 00:23:59,298
All right.

261
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:00,878
It's okay.

262
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,000
Oh, but meeting long, right?

263
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,360
Yep.

264
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,440
All right.

265
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:34,391
One of our biggest concerns as students obviously is balancing homework with sort of like home life and other academic work because one of the biggest things that we see as students is that when we're deciding at the end of each year when we're deciding say what classes we want to take next year

266
00:24:35,291 --> 00:24:55,558
Obviously there's a certain importance placed on the classes that we take, sort of the academic rigor that we choose to strive for, but at the same time a lot of our choices are very much dictated by how much homework we perceive or how much homework we believe that class is going to give us because

267
00:24:56,334 --> 00:25:00,135
On top of being academic, we also have a lot of responsibility.

268
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:05,557
And I don't want to speak for everybody, but I know I've got a lot of things outside of school.

269
00:25:05,657 --> 00:25:06,797
I have a job.

270
00:25:06,957 --> 00:25:08,177
I have personal hobbies.

271
00:25:08,477 --> 00:25:11,258
I know other people have almost responsibilities.

272
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:14,439
And families, maybe their families need an extra source of income.

273
00:25:14,459 --> 00:25:15,919
Maybe they need to care for a loved one.

274
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:24,962
And homework is a really important way in which school interacts with home life.

275
00:25:25,703 --> 00:25:37,287
And we feel that there are certain things, not everything, but we feel like there are certain things that can be improved upon and refined to better sort of like protect students from an overbearing workload of homework.

276
00:25:38,547 --> 00:25:42,128
And that's sort of what we have in the document here.

277
00:25:42,988 --> 00:25:50,951
A lot of it is sort of justifying, sort of saying why these certain things are issues, why we believe they need to be addressed.

278
00:25:51,778 --> 00:26:07,349
And we do have, and just very similar, we are going to update the format of everything in the next version, but we have interspersed specific wording, things that we specifically like to address.

279
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:09,991
So the first thing on there.

280
00:26:20,738 --> 00:26:30,467
Yeah, let's read the, um, yeah, including here what the current homework policy is this supply provided by.

281
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:35,452
And I see and the laws there.

282
00:26:36,473 --> 00:26:42,058
Um, I, I will take the time to read through to read through the datum.

283
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,241
But essentially, the biggest thing that we get from here is that sort of homework.

284
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:54,807
by the definition set forth here is supposed to improve the learning process and aid in the mastery of skills or otherwise stimulate interest in a topic.

285
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:12,525
Obviously, there are provisions already in there, but the biggest thing that we want to try to address in this is what we call busy work, which is a very informal term.

286
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:17,747
But busy work is just homework that's given to the sake of keeping students busy.

287
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:22,130
It's homework that necessarily might have a purpose, but at the same time,

288
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:31,592
isn't necessarily linked in a strong way to what's being learned in class or what students are taking out of that class.

289
00:27:34,073 --> 00:27:49,197
And if that makes sense, it's kind of like a loose term to pin down again because it's such an informal term, but at the same time it is also sort of the biggest issue we experience as students and it's something we really want to address here.

290
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:02,962
So just some things we wanted to bring up, some suggestions almost of different wording we believe could help.

291
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:19,347
Busy work, again, although enforcement of whatnot will have to be case-by-case basis by schools, but for example, one of the things we have is homework should always have a discernible purpose, meaning students mastering and understanding of a specific topic, or

292
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:29,636
We saw the definition of homework was above.

293
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:32,879
No students should not be given the sole purpose of keeping students busy.

294
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:47,754
And additionally, this is one thing I included based on enforcement, the responsibility of individual teachers and school administrators to ensure that homework given is used to aid students' mastery and understanding of the topic.

295
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:55,719
Sort of verbatim of the first suggestion there, but also including sort of the idea of who's enforcing it and whose job it is to enforce that.

296
00:28:57,336 --> 00:29:04,658
Um, so I'm kind of moving a little bit quickly, but.

297
00:29:05,438 --> 00:29:13,020
Yes, but I know we don't have a time and I don't want to repeat verbatim.

298
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,381
I think something written here, of course, obviously, it's available to you guys.

299
00:29:19,962 --> 00:29:21,042
So, the other thing that we.

300
00:29:21,822 --> 00:29:23,363
Often deal with as students is.

301
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:34,136
unreasonable due dates and due dates that are very close and sort of like, again, not reasonable to what can be expected or what's expected of us for that.

302
00:29:34,797 --> 00:29:52,108
And that can be unreasonable due, it's got to be like learning by the test, before it's due, getting an essay to do, like, at the end of the day, and it's due tomorrow, things where the level of work required vast exceeds the amount of time we've had to complete it.

303
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:53,129
And

304
00:29:57,017 --> 00:30:20,765
uh certainly yes and so like a couple of suggestions we have adequate notice of homework assignments given few days must be reasonable for the level of work and time expected to complete it that's another thing too is sort of like the expectation of how much time students should be giving to a specific uh topic to a specific homework assignment because everybody works at different rates and so the teacher expects

305
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:24,948
There's students who spend like 20, 30 minutes on an assignment.

306
00:30:25,188 --> 00:30:33,115
That student shouldn't be spending upwards of an hour, even if it means they can't fully complete it, because it's just not reasonable for that amount of time to be spent.

307
00:30:37,458 --> 00:30:43,123
One other thing in terms of vacation and vacation time, a lot of times we

308
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:55,451
What we see as students is it will be an assignment due, not necessarily right after break, but a large enough assignment that we have to continually work during break to finish it by the due date after break.

309
00:30:59,055 --> 00:31:04,660
So obviously, number one, we want to make sure that that scheduled vacation time is respected by all teachers.

310
00:31:05,301 --> 00:31:12,087
And if they do decide to get homework over that break, that they get at least a week's worth of notice for that work.

311
00:31:12,107 --> 00:31:16,571
So that way students have the opportunity to get ahead of that and to perhaps not have homework for that break.

312
00:31:16,591 --> 00:31:19,233
The end.

313
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:35,539
And then also one final thing that we also believe that that kind of homework should be only reinforcing what students are bringing in class and not like learning entirely new things.

314
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:46,423
So the next section talks about it's basically how homework has the possibility to have detriments towards a child's education if they lack the knowledge to complete it.

315
00:31:46,963 --> 00:31:48,344
So the intent

316
00:31:48,902 --> 00:31:53,346
For homework, it should be used as a reinforcement, and it should be a logical extension of what is learned in class.

317
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:59,571
So students should be able to complete the homework, and it should not be an entirely new subject.

318
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:06,096
So that's just a little bullet point that we suggested, and then I'll just take the next section as well.

319
00:32:06,116 --> 00:32:11,541
Taking into account the diversity and background for students attending within Meckler Public Schools,

320
00:32:13,484 --> 00:32:23,331
We often find that a lot of times we have school holidays, but teachers will assign assignments over those religious holidays, even when they're not supposed to.

321
00:32:23,351 --> 00:32:32,058
So we just have a suggestion that that be added for that reason, to ensure equity for all students of all religious backgrounds and cultural backgrounds.

322
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:50,209
And then just another thing that students, we as students encounter is sometimes teachers will assign assignments like into the evening and it'll kind of put us in a scramble to get the assignments done for the next day.

323
00:32:50,290 --> 00:33:01,137
So we just suggested that any homework assignments, faculty posts, or teachers rather, that posts be posted by the end of the day to give us adequate time to complete the assignment.

324
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,494
And then on the subject of sick days.

325
00:33:10,572 --> 00:33:23,997
We found in our survey, which was, I believe, brought up at previous meetings, that there's a sizable amount of students who come in sick to school because they don't want to have to make up the work.

326
00:33:25,037 --> 00:33:32,500
And we believe part of that reason is because of the inflexible policy regarding makeup work for students who are sick.

327
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,282
So we just have this bullet point to address that to ensure a sense of adequate time

328
00:33:40,151 --> 00:33:48,295
to complete work that they would miss if they take a sick day, so that students can take sick days without having to worry about being overwhelmed by schoolwork.

329
00:33:49,796 --> 00:33:56,620
So this is a point that we are still kind of workshopping.

330
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,080
We still need to do a little more research on.

331
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:08,267
But it is, as of now, the policy of Medford High School that homework is graded on completion rather than accuracy.

332
00:34:08,928 --> 00:34:22,379
And again, we do want to do more research for suggestions on the school committee level, but we do believe there is a distinct benefit to grading homework on completion rather than accuracy, mainly because it encourages students to strive

333
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:33,883
to continually try and try their best as opposed to trying their best and getting marked off for it.

334
00:34:34,283 --> 00:34:44,725
For example, a student may try their best and not understand the topic and then grade it poorly, whereas another student may understand it perfectly and immediately get that good grade.

335
00:34:45,145 --> 00:34:47,346
And that kind of creates a disparity between the two.

336
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:52,027
In addition to that, what can happen as well is that a student may

337
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:57,750
skimmed out on homework and may not necessarily do all the homework and get answers from their friends.

338
00:34:57,810 --> 00:35:11,958
And if things are greater accuracy, then a student who's overwhelmed with homework may be more encouraged to take that easy way out for the grade, as opposed to at least trying something on their own and getting credit for that.

339
00:35:12,818 --> 00:35:19,882
And so that's sort of like, again, we do want more research on that, but that is something we want to push for.

340
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:27,292
The other thing we want to talk about is snow days.

341
00:35:30,114 --> 00:35:40,163
Final thing is that we believe that if there's a snow day homework on that snow day, additional homework should not be

342
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:44,746
assigned on that snow day.

343
00:35:45,126 --> 00:36:07,574
Obviously we'll need to rework that a little bit more, taking into account whether or not there's like multiple snow days in a row, or say there's like a big snow storm, maybe like a week off, obviously we'll need to put some sort of quantifier on that, just sort of the idea that if we have a snow day, we should take that day to either shovel, relax, sort of just like take that rest day and not have additional work to do on that day.

344
00:36:08,594 --> 00:36:27,522
And then the last step in here is that sort of more justifying, more derby is about everything, about all the different topics we've been, which I think I, me and Darren have sort of summarized in words.

345
00:36:29,944 --> 00:36:33,885
Yeah, that's about the size of it.

346
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:37,747
So that was homework.

347
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:41,765
So, okay.

348
00:36:42,205 --> 00:36:42,606
Thank you.

349
00:36:42,686 --> 00:36:48,451
This was very thoughtful, very well researched, and I appreciate what's gone into this.

350
00:36:48,871 --> 00:37:00,522
Can I ask, have you spoken to any of the school, the faculty, teachers about the alignment, any of your advisors about the alignment with their, with learning goals and course goals?

351
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:03,730
Um, currently we have not reached out.

352
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:06,392
Um, well, we currently have not gotten any response.

353
00:37:06,693 --> 00:37:12,437
Uh, I recently reached out to, I believe Mr. Green, who is the teacher union representative at the high school.

354
00:37:12,937 --> 00:37:18,862
Um, so we're looking to meet with him and potentially have them look over the, um, the homework policy.

355
00:37:19,182 --> 00:37:21,304
Cause we have one for a district level and a local level.

356
00:37:21,784 --> 00:37:26,148
Um, so it's just, we have to find the time to meet with them.

357
00:37:26,808 --> 00:37:31,772
Um, but yeah, that's, we are looking to get feedback from teachers, parents, and students as well.

358
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:39,264
Yeah, I think that'd be great.

359
00:37:40,085 --> 00:37:47,211
Meeting with Mr. Guillaume, Mr. Green is also at a former position was also a proofreader so he'll be able to help.

360
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:50,695
If there's anything that he feels like should be added as well.

361
00:37:51,996 --> 00:38:00,263
I love how much thought has gone into this, especially I think I heard someone I think might have been knows like quantifiers in terms of.

362
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:03,808
missing homework, especially on snow days.

363
00:38:03,988 --> 00:38:08,752
And then, you know, at what point do we go, okay, we kind of need to start instruction back up.

364
00:38:08,852 --> 00:38:12,295
I think that's an incredible thought to be brought into it.

365
00:38:14,116 --> 00:38:15,197
I did have a question.

366
00:38:15,237 --> 00:38:20,381
There was a comment made about homework assigned.

367
00:38:21,502 --> 00:38:26,967
Is our, backtracking for one second.

368
00:38:27,848 --> 00:38:30,229
Was a point made, has this been happening where

369
00:38:31,323 --> 00:38:46,103
faculty members will assign homework like way after hours to be completed for the following day is that what that was referring to where like homework will be assigned at like four or 5pm to then be completed during the school day is that like I don't want to get.

370
00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:54,356
you know, into something if that's not the case, but is that, was that, is that a reoccurring thing that's been happening?

371
00:38:55,476 --> 00:39:00,798
That's more of like an extreme case, but that does happen like on occasion here and there.

372
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,559
What we see more often is

373
00:39:03,699 --> 00:39:22,602
say a student will, a teacher will be absent for a day, maybe we'll go to the lecture hall, but at some point after that class time has happened, after our allotted class time for that class has happened, then we get sort of an announcement on Google Classroom, hey this is sort of like homework for tomorrow or class work for today or something like that, and it feels like we don't have that

374
00:39:23,228 --> 00:39:31,272
in class time to do that, it's kind of difficult to either expand upon that homework or even just like finish it by the next day.

375
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:32,313
I gotcha.

376
00:39:32,373 --> 00:39:45,840
So it's more of looking to, especially in those lecture hall, which are usually like the last worst case scenario situations of having the work be assigned so that way you're not sitting there playing with playing cards and just kind of doing other classwork.

377
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,142
It's in that instruction period where your mind is set to work on

378
00:39:51,147 --> 00:39:57,956
American history to be working on a push homework essentially is what the thought is with that so it's more about that and less of like.

379
00:39:58,617 --> 00:40:08,310
you're getting an email at 4pm that saying hey this is actually doing eight now okay just just checking to see what that was I wasn't sure what was going on, so I appreciate the information.

380
00:40:08,646 --> 00:40:29,604
But overall, a lot of thought has been going into this, and I really appreciate the research that's done with the National Parents Union, within district and local wide, within quantifiers looking at, sometimes there may be certain situations where, thinking about the faculty member, if there is an extreme case in their end, they may just not be able to get it.

381
00:40:29,684 --> 00:40:36,369
So the understanding of working with people, I'm talking in circles right now,

382
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:43,255
overall just really appreciate the work that's being done and looking forward to seeing what will be presented in the discussions we're having.

383
00:40:44,696 --> 00:40:49,159
What would you most like to get from the school committee members who are in the room right now?

384
00:40:49,460 --> 00:41:02,270
I'm aware of the time and that there are more things on the agenda and obviously as an educator I have a lot of thoughts on how this all plays out and I don't think this is the moment to go into depth in every point because there's a lot to be discussed and

385
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:09,606
Um, hashed out, but you know, is this something that we would want to schedule a subcommittee meeting with the curriculum?

386
00:41:10,766 --> 00:41:15,528
Subcommittee and instruction to, to talk about this with teachers and students in the room.

387
00:41:16,548 --> 00:41:24,691
What would be most useful at this point with limited time for, in terms of either in this meeting or next steps that you would like to see?

388
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:30,073
I guess it's from like.

389
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:41,880
My perspective, it would be nice to try and fast track this, just because homework is such a pressing issue for students, not only at the high school, but at the district level.

390
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:58,190
So we feel that if we can get this policy thoughtfully completed as a priority for the school committee in terms of students' handbook policies, that would be nice to have that priority.

391
00:41:59,764 --> 00:42:00,024
Thank you.

392
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:04,648
That's really helpful because I think school committee can set policies and obviously that does take some time.

393
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:10,614
There's a limit to, especially with open meetings, of how fast a fast track is.

394
00:42:11,414 --> 00:42:24,386
But also there's the stipulation that the implementation falls to the schools themselves and we can't tell teachers how to teach, but we can set some of those parameters, whether it's about the homework, about

395
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,916
the expectations per syllabus.

396
00:42:26,956 --> 00:42:32,598
A lot of this seems to be about laying out what are the expectations and knowing what's coming over the course of a year.

397
00:42:33,558 --> 00:42:35,539
But thank you, that's really helpful.

398
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:38,680
I see how urgent this is on many levels.

399
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:54,064
So with that, we're gonna hand it off to Mandy and Maria to talk about transportation at the high school.

400
00:42:55,051 --> 00:43:00,555
Hello, I'm Olivia, and I'm currently working with Mandy on the transportation conflict.

401
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:07,020
So for this, we have not drafted a policy yet because we just wanted to get the proper approval for this first.

402
00:43:08,221 --> 00:43:12,204
Currently with the transportation conflict, we have five main issues.

403
00:43:13,945 --> 00:43:16,427
The first one and the biggest one, student safety, of course.

404
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:20,370
Personal experience, I think a lot of us have seen this.

405
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:21,891
When we're waiting for the buses,

406
00:43:22,571 --> 00:43:26,212
There's not a proper line for the students getting into the buses.

407
00:43:26,712 --> 00:43:27,953
This wasn't like this before.

408
00:43:28,553 --> 00:43:30,754
This year, especially, it has gotten really bad.

409
00:43:31,754 --> 00:43:37,736
Students crowd and they push into each other trying to get into the buses.

410
00:43:38,217 --> 00:43:42,118
And I have seen people get hurt near the doors of the buses.

411
00:43:42,218 --> 00:43:44,519
It's a big mess.

412
00:43:45,603 --> 00:43:54,290
I think there needs to be some sort of a physical barrier or a line of some sort for us to maintain the order when the students get onto the buses.

413
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:57,093
We can talk about that more.

414
00:43:57,153 --> 00:44:05,060
But the second one issue that I have is we need a designated bus departure and arrival position.

415
00:44:07,021 --> 00:44:11,285
Because there is no set position for the buses, sometimes when we are going home,

416
00:44:11,778 --> 00:44:15,060
and the buses just come line up either at the front or the back.

417
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:17,881
Some students are not used to the different positions every time.

418
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:22,323
So they don't see the buses from the doors and they miss the buses.

419
00:44:22,803 --> 00:44:26,065
And there's just a lot of issues with that as well.

420
00:44:26,605 --> 00:44:39,131
And this is another reason why people like the students are crowding because as the buses move down the road, the students are also moving down the road in a crowd and it's just a really big mess.

421
00:44:41,474 --> 00:44:53,479
And not only that, our question would be, there's three types of buses, four actually, and there is a different amount of buses that come in.

422
00:44:53,840 --> 00:45:05,805
There's say like four 101s and then two or three 134s and only two 95s and the yellow bus that people in North Medford take.

423
00:45:06,385 --> 00:45:09,447
And we were wondering that, yes, it's because

424
00:45:11,035 --> 00:45:16,059
the MBTA don't really go into the North Medford area.

425
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:27,709
Is there another alternative slash can we add more buses to people who are not accessible to bus cards or any location near that?

426
00:45:28,129 --> 00:45:37,857
Because that might also be a reason why people are late to school because there's not enough MBTA bus stops around where they live.

427
00:45:38,658 --> 00:45:38,878
And also,

428
00:45:41,753 --> 00:45:54,799
I understand that the majority of people take the 101, but also the time intervals between them are very out of order.

429
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,521
Say the 101 has four buses.

430
00:45:59,402 --> 00:46:04,124
The time intervals between how they arrive are about five to 10 minutes.

431
00:46:04,964 --> 00:46:09,427
And we're just curious if we can decrease the amount of 101s and have

432
00:46:10,862 --> 00:46:18,707
set arrival times for people who are, say, staying after school for extra help.

433
00:46:18,727 --> 00:46:39,621
And that way, students can know when to leave specifically, unless they have other issues, so that they can take the bus on time and not miss it, and possibly wait for another bus

434
00:46:40,761 --> 00:46:42,622
And also, I take the 95.

435
00:46:43,422 --> 00:46:50,325
And I've seen that sometimes it comes from 230 to 245.

436
00:46:51,065 --> 00:46:53,726
And sometimes it comes early as well.

437
00:46:54,426 --> 00:47:04,810
And it's very difficult because I live like almost across West Mefford, which is difficult for me to get rides and take the bus.

438
00:47:04,850 --> 00:47:08,411
And I would just like to clear if there's any

439
00:47:10,851 --> 00:47:17,496
concern any any aid that we can get to the number of buses and the schedules.

440
00:47:18,737 --> 00:47:20,539
I just wanted to add on to the 95 part.

441
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:29,947
We both take the 95 and honestly it is extremely annoying because as she said um the 95 the first one comes very early.

442
00:47:29,987 --> 00:47:37,553
There are only two 95s and I have seen a lot of people get up to the 95s like honestly there are I would say there are

443
00:47:38,294 --> 00:47:42,275
almost more people on the 95 than there are in the 101.

444
00:47:43,055 --> 00:47:44,796
And only two buses.

445
00:47:46,216 --> 00:47:50,917
A lot of students crowd onto the first one because the second one comes so late.

446
00:47:52,018 --> 00:48:03,061
And like I for one have work right after school and I can't get onto the last one because it's really late, but I also can't get onto the first one because there are too many people and I can't fit.

447
00:48:04,361 --> 00:48:07,442
The 95, another problem when going to school,

448
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:09,610
The first one comes in time.

449
00:48:09,710 --> 00:48:13,774
I always go on the first one, but the second bus, it's supposed to come at 705.

450
00:48:14,455 --> 00:48:17,257
It doesn't come until like 718.

451
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:24,363
If I mistakenly miss the bus one day, I almost miss school time.

452
00:48:24,383 --> 00:48:24,463
Yeah.

453
00:48:27,330 --> 00:48:32,952
So this was a topic that just came up in our previous meeting.

454
00:48:33,272 --> 00:48:38,234
And I want you to know that I did reach out to Vivian Ortiz, who is Safe Routes to School.

455
00:48:39,214 --> 00:48:50,799
And I had CC the students to ask her some questions and see if she would like to come and do an audit on our drop off and pick up.

456
00:48:51,659 --> 00:49:00,247
and see basically what her recommendations would be for drop off and pick up with safe routes to school.

457
00:49:01,448 --> 00:49:17,542
Something that also might be appropriate after we've done an audit or an assessment like that is because the MBTA is a Massachusetts state agency, once we have some data that we can point to as well as these helpful anecdotes,

458
00:49:18,472 --> 00:49:21,455
and kind of qualitative analyses of it.

459
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:26,860
We can also consider going to our state legislative delegation.

460
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:36,308
Our state reps and our state senator would be able to, you know, help us advocate with the MBTA potentially for changes or additions to schedules.

461
00:49:36,368 --> 00:49:36,989
There's a whole

462
00:49:38,117 --> 00:49:46,882
process on the MBTA side, you know, for that we can't, it's not a decision we get to make from Medford, although it's certainly a petition that we could raise.

463
00:49:46,982 --> 00:49:53,646
So I think we should also be thinking down the road about getting in touch with our three reps and our senator.

464
00:49:54,708 --> 00:50:03,154
We actually have just been awarded a grant from Safe Routes to School for bike racks at the Andrew School as a test pilot.

465
00:50:03,974 --> 00:50:05,155
So we are working with them.

466
00:50:06,055 --> 00:50:16,442
And I think that's a great, we are launching a survey with Safe Routes to School later this week on Friday that'll run for about two or three weeks.

467
00:50:16,882 --> 00:50:21,766
And we're really looking for a lot of participation from across the districts, from our district.

468
00:50:22,906 --> 00:50:25,287
to make sure that we're getting as much information as possible.

469
00:50:25,307 --> 00:50:26,987
I really appreciate you bringing it to us.

470
00:50:27,527 --> 00:50:30,307
So you mentioned, Maria, five things.

471
00:50:30,868 --> 00:50:32,448
I just want to make sure I got them.

472
00:50:33,028 --> 00:50:34,408
And so you're going to have to fill in some blanks.

473
00:50:34,428 --> 00:50:35,568
So the first is safety.

474
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:43,410
The second is crowding at the bus lines as they're coming up Steve Miller Drive to the West Courtyard area.

475
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:49,011
The third is that there should be some type of signage that says where buses pick up.

476
00:50:49,651 --> 00:50:53,855
like the 101, we'll always pick up at this location.

477
00:50:53,875 --> 00:50:55,236
All right.

478
00:50:55,296 --> 00:50:58,298
And essentially we'll pull forward to a stop point.

479
00:50:58,759 --> 00:51:01,341
The fourth thing is the erratic times.

480
00:51:01,861 --> 00:51:02,782
Equity purposes.

481
00:51:02,942 --> 00:51:04,824
For equity purposes around that.

482
00:51:05,244 --> 00:51:06,545
And then the fifth, just so.

483
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:07,867
The number of buses.

484
00:51:07,927 --> 00:51:08,727
The number of buses.

485
00:51:08,907 --> 00:51:09,208
OK.

486
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:12,771
Yeah.

487
00:51:13,151 --> 00:51:17,194
And I think the safety and the crowding with the signage, if we're able to do that,

488
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:25,725
so that all the students aren't standing on the sidewalk waiting, but also coming up with some sort of procedure of how we do dismissal.

489
00:51:25,805 --> 00:51:30,689
I think the bell rings and everyone goes out there and especially with the nice weather, there's more students out there.

490
00:51:30,709 --> 00:51:39,014
So making sure that we're putting in a protocol for dismissal and getting on the bus, I think is great.

491
00:51:40,074 --> 00:51:48,080
And one of our other student advisory council students when talking about this did ask, it's a bottleneck at Medford High.

492
00:51:48,201 --> 00:51:53,845
Has it always, now for the people who went to school here, has it always been that way?

493
00:51:56,527 --> 00:51:59,690
In terms of like people trying to funnel in?

494
00:52:00,831 --> 00:52:03,953
Yes, pick up and drop off, okay.

495
00:52:04,434 --> 00:52:08,437
So in terms of pick up, I don't recall.

496
00:52:09,945 --> 00:52:12,346
So drop off to the school, I don't recall.

497
00:52:12,606 --> 00:52:18,729
I drove or got driven in full transparency in terms of hiccup.

498
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:27,152
The side where community schools is where that like stone courtyard is, that is what we're talking about in terms of like students funneling in.

499
00:52:27,472 --> 00:52:28,413
It's always been a mess.

500
00:52:28,493 --> 00:52:31,514
I remember students like standing on the hills.

501
00:52:31,834 --> 00:52:34,515
They used to line up on the hills and try to balance themselves.

502
00:52:35,595 --> 00:52:38,877
But also in terms of the buses, I am a victim of the North Meffitt Heights.

503
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:44,307
I live in the North Memphis Heights.

504
00:52:44,347 --> 00:52:45,908
I live right on the border of Malden.

505
00:52:46,108 --> 00:52:50,611
So if I had to take the bus home, I was on the yellow school bus.

506
00:52:51,292 --> 00:53:02,279
So I also know that and that picking up at a way different location was always weird to me of why that picks up by the Vogue automotive shop where the MBTA buses pick up at the community schools entrance.

507
00:53:04,491 --> 00:53:05,932
So yeah, it's always been crowded.

508
00:53:06,153 --> 00:53:10,196
It's always, I don't, I never viewed it as a safety issue at the time.

509
00:53:11,457 --> 00:53:14,240
So I don't, I haven't been up there during drop off.

510
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:18,764
So I don't know if it's getting worse in terms of like people just not knowing where to stand, how it looks.

511
00:53:18,824 --> 00:53:22,627
It sounds like from the student representatives that it is getting a lot worse.

512
00:53:23,087 --> 00:53:24,408
So if we can figure out ways to

513
00:53:26,471 --> 00:53:34,814
channel students to understand where to go or if the line gets too long where to wrap around and make sure you're still in the same line of the 95 versus the 101.

514
00:53:36,355 --> 00:53:43,418
But yeah, also wanted to give my thanks for this for the students who are working on this issue because it has always been an issue.

515
00:53:43,938 --> 00:53:45,299
It was an issue when I was there.

516
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:50,561
It sounds like the safety part is a bigger issue that I had never heard of.

517
00:53:51,522 --> 00:53:52,764
So thank you for bringing that up.

518
00:53:53,926 --> 00:54:03,259
But yeah, the whole the North Memphis bus is a whole nother issue with the MBTA not offering their services really up in our, our neck of the woods, so.

519
00:54:05,586 --> 00:54:07,207
I have one question and one comment.

520
00:54:07,948 --> 00:54:12,312
One question is, are these conditions exacerbated during inclement weather?

521
00:54:12,392 --> 00:54:21,660
I ask because I personally am a most seasons biker, and so I'm curious about alternative transportation in terms of biking as well.

522
00:54:23,441 --> 00:54:25,042
Are there more people riding buses?

523
00:54:27,204 --> 00:54:28,806
Does the weather affect these issues?

524
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,276
No, I don't think so, no.

525
00:54:32,596 --> 00:54:36,178
And we have quite a few students who do bike to school, absolutely.

526
00:54:37,159 --> 00:54:40,421
But there isn't really a difference in inclement weather.

527
00:54:41,402 --> 00:54:42,102
That's good to hear.

528
00:54:42,383 --> 00:54:54,231
And then the other, the comment that I wanted to make is that this is really good timing to have this meeting because we have a strategic planning subcommittee meeting scheduled for Monday about a district-wide transportation survey.

529
00:54:55,072 --> 00:54:59,195
And so if there are particular questions that you think we ought to be asking more broadly in the community.

530
00:55:00,055 --> 00:55:05,037
I would certainly love to receive those from you in anticipation of this meeting on Monday.

531
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:09,039
Absolutely.

532
00:55:09,579 --> 00:55:11,780
And that can happen over email.

533
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:14,661
I'm not trying to put anyone on the spot, especially at 331.

534
00:55:18,562 --> 00:55:22,524
We'll definitely, I'll work with the students and we'll get some out to you.

535
00:55:27,666 --> 00:55:27,946
Thank you.

536
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,620
I believe that's it for transportation.

537
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,821
Go ahead.

538
00:55:37,002 --> 00:55:44,048
So I know we are at 330, but if members are able to stay for the last piece.

539
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:51,354
So lastly on the, I think it's in the email as well.

540
00:55:51,374 --> 00:55:53,155
Student organizations

541
00:55:55,695 --> 00:56:11,495
So basically, I've been working with other members on this advisory committee to make this because we find that students, not only at the high school level but also the elementary level which I've met with Mr. Allen, who is a teacher advisor for the student council at the Brooks.

542
00:56:12,518 --> 00:56:19,362
But we find that students don't really know how to get their voices heard and how the I guess the system works for student voice.

543
00:56:20,003 --> 00:56:24,866
So we've just made this flowchart and we're trying to get them printed.

544
00:56:24,966 --> 00:56:29,749
We're in the process of getting a larger one printed and hung up around the high school and hopefully at the other schools.

545
00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:34,732
Which is outlies to students how they can get involved and how change occurs.

546
00:56:35,313 --> 00:56:37,054
Throughout the district.

547
00:56:38,174 --> 00:56:38,635
And I just want to

548
00:56:39,942 --> 00:56:41,283
cycle back to the transportation.

549
00:56:41,303 --> 00:56:47,426
As someone who's biked to school, the bike lanes are not safe.

550
00:56:48,767 --> 00:56:51,428
Yeah, so that's all I have to say on that.

551
00:56:51,528 --> 00:56:54,490
Can you share that with me and I'll post it up?

552
00:57:00,194 --> 00:57:10,756
And I know that, I think it was Bike Medford, but for anyone listening, I don't wanna misspeak, but I do know that they were really hoping for a protected bike lane on Wentworth Street.

553
00:57:12,276 --> 00:57:25,539
And so I think as you leave Medford High School and become members of the community and those of you still here to still advocate for those protected bike lanes as the city moves through various construction projects.

554
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:27,062
Yes, it was protected.

555
00:57:27,302 --> 00:57:36,133
I was in that meeting that that those protected bike lanes went away because a lot of people spoke out against having bike lanes on Winthrop Street and the compromise was that the bike lanes not be protected.

556
00:57:36,674 --> 00:57:40,718
And that was because people showed up and fought against protected bike lanes.

557
00:57:40,779 --> 00:57:45,304
So if this is important, please do continue to show up at meetings to advocate.

558
00:57:52,654 --> 00:58:06,085
All right, let me share my screen and, and Darren, I'll allow you to, so that you can control as you speak or whoever wants to.

559
00:58:07,503 --> 00:58:22,412
So just starting from the top, we just have a little bit, I guess, FAQ for students on why their voice matters and how the student organizations work within the elementary, middle school, and at the high school level, as well as how they can get involved.

560
00:58:22,592 --> 00:58:24,733
So just a little bit of a blurb.

561
00:58:25,414 --> 00:58:27,115
And then we have the flowchart here.

562
00:58:27,135 --> 00:58:31,017
Oh, it's not scrolling.

563
00:58:41,288 --> 00:58:42,369
really not cooperating.

564
00:58:42,609 --> 00:58:44,311
Okay.

565
00:58:44,331 --> 00:58:53,540
Basically, it starts from the bottom and at the high school level, we have the Newly Formed Student Involvement Organization, which is similar to the Student Council.

566
00:58:55,002 --> 00:59:01,188
Basically, it's just like organization, they work together to get students involved in the kind of like

567
00:59:01,741 --> 00:59:05,623
the outreach branch of student involvement at the high school level.

568
00:59:05,683 --> 00:59:06,684
That's what it's envisioned to be.

569
00:59:07,164 --> 00:59:10,966
And then we also have the student governments, which work more to address grade level concerns.

570
00:59:11,666 --> 00:59:14,588
And then at the middle school and elementary school, we have these student councils.

571
00:59:15,769 --> 00:59:28,716
And then that gets forwarded so that we envision that the Medford High School Student Advisory Committee would be more of like a legislative body since legally speaking, we can only have five people on it.

572
00:59:29,401 --> 00:59:50,073
So the idea would be we would be just drafting stuff and we'd rely on the student government, student councils, student involvement organization to do the actual boots on the ground outreach, which we've also, that's part of a larger plan that I in the student advisory community working on to get more students involved and improve these student organizations at the high school and district level.

573
00:59:51,545 --> 01:00:01,908
And then stateside, which we haven't established yet, but we're working to, we plan on implementing a system so we can get statewide changes as well, which is outlined here.

574
01:00:02,969 --> 01:00:20,634
And then more on the local level, we have, after we drop the policy requests, letters, et cetera, they'd be sent to the corresponding administrations based on the level, whether that be elementary, middle school, high school level, and or the Meckler School Committee.

575
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:26,551
And that's the upload trait, which I believe is also the genome.

576
01:00:41,115 --> 01:00:44,976
Thank you for the work in putting it together and for presenting it.

577
01:00:44,996 --> 01:00:50,798
I'm gonna ask again, so what are you hoping to get from this group at this time in regards to this document?

578
01:00:52,655 --> 01:01:01,702
In regards to the document, I guess just, we have a bunch of draft documents outlining the responsibilities of these students' organizations.

579
01:01:01,902 --> 01:01:08,467
And I guess a big thing we would like is to have these documents on the school committee website under the student involvement.

580
01:01:08,807 --> 01:01:13,350
That way it's in writing, not on the school committee level, but also on the local school level.

581
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:16,412
So it's there for us students, as well as faculty and parents.

582
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:20,855
So there's more involvement as well as responsibilities that are clearly outlined for us.

583
01:01:23,683 --> 01:01:36,093
And if I could offer, I only looked at it last week, but if I could offer a friendly suggestion that I think that bigger posters might be better to help follow the lines.

584
01:01:36,694 --> 01:01:40,116
So as you're doing around school, that that might be very beneficial.

585
01:01:42,879 --> 01:01:47,963
And I know you said you were working on one of those, but just so that, you know, multiple in multiple places.

586
01:01:50,814 --> 01:01:51,974
No, I think this is great.

587
01:01:52,035 --> 01:01:58,317
Like I said, my, my education, my background is in user interface user experience.

588
01:01:58,357 --> 01:02:02,839
How do we tell people what the information is.

589
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,740
So I'm looking, I'm looking at it right now.

590
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,841
That's why I'm on my phone.

591
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:09,762
I love the color coding.

592
01:02:09,782 --> 01:02:10,842
I'm just going to like

593
01:02:12,643 --> 01:02:30,735
The fact that we're talking about state level changes how that because what this does is it does a great job of how you know how would you connect the mass legislature to an elementary school, like, how does that work that feedback gets there and this is a really good job of showing how this actually goes through the channels and the ways we need to get it done.

594
01:02:34,076 --> 01:02:43,362
definitely support having this in terms of on the school committee website in terms of how student voices are heard, and how that process happens.

595
01:02:44,863 --> 01:02:50,867
Because it also helps empower the students to show that you know your voice does matter and sometimes that can be hard to convince students of how.

596
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:54,929
you know, even at student government level, like, why does it matter?

597
01:02:54,969 --> 01:02:55,970
Why does it matter what I say?

598
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:56,991
Nothing gets changed anyways.

599
01:02:57,031 --> 01:02:58,592
Well, this is how it matters.

600
01:02:58,612 --> 01:03:04,756
This is how it goes up the ranks and we work together and we get what we need to be done changed.

601
01:03:05,216 --> 01:03:17,524
So I really applaud you all for taking the time to actually take a lot of complex information and ideas and put it into a very visual, very visual chart.

602
01:03:17,604 --> 01:03:18,625
So thank you for doing that.

603
01:03:21,112 --> 01:03:22,572
I just want to applaud you guys as well.

604
01:03:22,612 --> 01:03:24,673
I think the visual is excellent.

605
01:03:25,473 --> 01:03:41,858
And not just words, but for those who can follow the pictures and follow the dots and see the connection, I think you guys really did a great job designing it and making it user-friendly and accessible for all levels.

606
01:03:42,438 --> 01:03:42,778
Thank you.

607
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:54,558
I asked member Russo and Mr. Dalton what kind of protocols need to happen for something like this to be reviewed and put up as an official.

608
01:03:54,578 --> 01:03:57,561
This is my new member hat going.

609
01:03:58,362 --> 01:03:59,102
How would this work?

610
01:04:00,964 --> 01:04:02,886
Well, I mean, the website is implementation.

611
01:04:03,226 --> 01:04:04,267
It's not policy.

612
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:05,528
So it has nothing to do with us.

613
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:09,331
It has nothing to do with me.

614
01:04:09,431 --> 01:04:12,134
Yeah, it would be totally straightforward to

615
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:22,717
to set up a subpage of the school committee to be a site for documents from our student representatives.

616
01:04:23,558 --> 01:04:34,843
I think that would be a relatively straightforward matter of just getting me the content that we need, and then we can just talk about what we want it to look like when it's done.

617
01:04:35,244 --> 01:04:36,945
But certainly the infrastructure is there.

618
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:48,288
whether it's this flowchart or work on pre-documents or anything else.

619
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:51,910
Thank you.

620
01:05:02,835 --> 01:05:03,255
That's it.

621
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:03,596
All right.

622
01:05:04,716 --> 01:05:06,577
Well, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.

623
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,058
Do we need a motion to adjourn?

624
01:05:08,078 --> 01:05:08,538
Yeah, we do.

625
01:05:08,758 --> 01:05:09,118
All right.

626
01:05:09,138 --> 01:05:09,759
Motion to adjourn.

627
01:05:13,005 --> 01:05:13,365
Second.

628
01:05:14,766 --> 01:05:16,147
I said first, but that's OK.

629
01:05:16,367 --> 01:05:17,468
Oh, great.

630
01:05:17,548 --> 01:05:21,991
Remember Einfeld?

631
01:05:23,091 --> 01:05:23,352
Yes.

632
01:05:24,452 --> 01:05:25,533
Remember Olopade?

633
01:05:26,253 --> 01:05:26,534
Yes.

634
01:05:27,554 --> 01:05:28,135
Remember Tappa?

635
01:05:28,935 --> 01:05:29,215
Yes.

636
01:05:30,536 --> 01:05:33,218
So yes, for the affirmative, this meeting is adjourned.

637
01:05:33,258 --> 01:05:33,738
Thank you, everyone.

638
01:05:33,758 --> 01:05:34,499
Have a good night.

639
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:36,920
Thank you, everyone.
