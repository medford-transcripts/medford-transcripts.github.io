4
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,514
There's a link in today's show notes.

5
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:23,276
Today's episode includes an interview with the owner of Swap It.

6
00:00:23,756 --> 00:00:29,299
I really enjoyed talking about affordable ways of accessing empowering stylists while also reducing waste.

7
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:30,660
I hope you enjoy too.

8
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:40,224
All right, thank you so much for joining me today.

9
00:00:40,364 --> 00:00:44,706
I'm wondering if we could start just by introducing yourself with your name and pronouns and a bit about who you are.

10
00:00:45,607 --> 00:00:45,867
Sure.

11
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,147
I'm Stephanie Johnson.

12
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:48,368
I am she her.

13
00:00:48,388 --> 00:00:53,110
I am a mom of three, a wife, a homeowner.

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,732
And then obviously, I own my small business swap it right here in Medford.

15
00:00:58,768 --> 00:00:58,968
Great.

16
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:02,029
And so that's, you know, hopefully we're going to talk a little bit about today.

17
00:01:02,069 --> 00:01:10,172
But before we get to that, I want to ask you the question that I ask everybody, which is what your favorite place to eat is in Medford or what you like to eat there.

18
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:17,595
So that is a tough one that I thought about because my store is actually surrounded by a bunch of restaurants because I'm in South Medford.

19
00:01:18,315 --> 00:01:23,497
But really, I do have to say that my favorite is real gusto in Medford Square.

20
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,788
because well, not only is the food good, but also if you get the right table, you like sit along the water and it's like really pretty.

21
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,352
It just makes you feel like you're not in like a city.

22
00:01:34,548 --> 00:01:35,969
That's definitely one of our favorites too.

23
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:41,793
And really good, really good, uh, like sort of fast food, like faster food options and takeouts.

24
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:42,434
Yeah.

25
00:01:42,494 --> 00:01:49,258
And I know that they've like, um, because of the theater down there, a lot of those restaurants have been doing like a theater menu.

26
00:01:49,298 --> 00:01:54,222
So like when you like, you know, to go there, but eat there before you go to a show, which has been really cool.

27
00:01:54,802 --> 00:01:55,303
Um, cool.

28
00:01:57,144 --> 00:01:57,644
Um, awesome.

29
00:01:57,684 --> 00:02:01,827
So I'm hoping that, uh, we could hear a little bit about your business that you mentioned.

30
00:02:01,847 --> 00:02:04,209
If you could tell us a little bit about what swap it is, what you do.

31
00:02:05,885 --> 00:02:06,145
Sure.

32
00:02:06,165 --> 00:02:15,414
So Swabbit is a brick and mortar women plus thrift store, um, where we swap instead of shop.

33
00:02:15,775 --> 00:02:20,059
So it's a little bit different than traditional retail, traditional thrifting.

34
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:21,740
We don't buy or consign clothing.

35
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:29,448
What you do is you come in with clothes, um, we count them up and then you take home like the same amount of clothes.

36
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:30,689
It's just, it's swapping.

37
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:42,002
And that what that really does is help to, and kind of like the stress that people have when shopping that you probably don't even realize when you walk into a store, you're thinking about like a hundred different things at once.

38
00:02:42,083 --> 00:02:48,368
And that's kind of what like, you know, people that don't love shopping, that's what can kind of like get their heart going is like, you're looking at price tag.

39
00:02:48,388 --> 00:02:52,912
You're looking at the brand you're looking at, if it fits, if you like it, do you already own 80 of these?

40
00:02:53,332 --> 00:02:54,273
Like, do you really need it?

41
00:02:54,313 --> 00:02:55,094
Are you going to wear it?

42
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:55,774
Does it fit right?

43
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:57,396
Could you find something that fits a little bit better?

44
00:02:57,748 --> 00:02:59,149
You're in between sizes right now.

45
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:04,133
Maybe you shouldn't invest in this piece because you think you're going to lose the weight or, you know, you're trying to get pregnant.

46
00:03:04,153 --> 00:03:10,077
You shouldn't invest in this piece because you're going to gain the weight and, and a million questions that you don't realize that's happening.

47
00:03:10,177 --> 00:03:14,320
And so much of that is eliminated with swapping.

48
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,043
And then of course, there's also on the other end, there's the environmental piece.

49
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:26,888
And when you swap, it not only gives your clothes a new home and a second life, but it also helps you not shop brand new, right?

50
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:30,091
Like if you give something up, you're getting value back from that piece.

51
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:33,314
And so it creates a market on both sides.

52
00:03:33,374 --> 00:03:39,019
It creates the people that are, you know, actually spending the time to get their clothes to a place where someone else can use them.

53
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:43,403
And it also creates the market for people looking for that secondhand clothes.

54
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:59,067
So I understand there's like an equal exchange of you're bringing in clothes that maybe you're done using or don't fit and sort of taking away hopefully like an equal amount of sort of what's fitting your body at the time or what maybe is appealing to you.

55
00:03:59,107 --> 00:04:02,991
And I'm a member of the Everything is Free Medford Facebook group.

56
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:10,697
And I think this happens in a sort of a different way on there, but there's always people posting about like, you know, like just what you said, like I'm pregnant or like,

57
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:16,560
you know, there's like, you know, certain seasons in our lives where like different, you know, different things are appealing.

58
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:20,863
And that's, that sounds really cool and convenient.

59
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:21,803
How does it work?

60
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:25,305
So if I wanted to come to the store, like what would that, how would that work?

61
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:31,908
So our biggest sort of offering, our biggest value proposition is our membership.

62
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:38,425
And it does exactly like what you said with the, everything is free groups and people do, um, you know, home swaps.

63
00:04:38,465 --> 00:04:42,887
We basically formalized this informal economy that's happening.

64
00:04:43,427 --> 00:04:44,507
So it's a membership.

65
00:04:44,627 --> 00:04:47,168
It's $147 for the entire year.

66
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:49,048
You get unlimited swaps.

67
00:04:49,228 --> 00:04:56,770
So bring as much stuff as you want in at any time over the year and take, you know, as much stuff, the same amount of stuff home.

68
00:04:57,321 --> 00:05:01,484
And I said equal, but most people bring in way more than they take.

69
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:06,207
I've been in a lot of people's closets and until I started this, I did not realize how much clothing people have.

70
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:08,208
That's just a side note.

71
00:05:08,268 --> 00:05:10,730
But so, yeah, that's what it is.

72
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,271
You get unlimited visits, you get unlimited swaps.

73
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:18,275
So you can get, you know, you can go through so many cycles with that.

74
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:19,736
You can go through all the seasons.

75
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:26,160
You can go from, you know, being pregnant to after pregnancy body to back to feeling a little bit more normal.

76
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:30,659
Um, you can go from being a stay at home mom to a working mom.

77
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:31,759
You can go from.

78
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:36,841
COVID when you never left your house to now, like, Oh, wait, maybe you leave every so often.

79
00:05:36,881 --> 00:05:39,141
And you're like, I haven't worn pants in two years.

80
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:39,461
Right.

81
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:44,923
So, um, we're doing a pants event because this week actually, because that's exactly what's happening.

82
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,363
Everyone's like, Oh my God, I need pants.

83
00:05:46,383 --> 00:05:49,684
Like I got rid of all of them and I only have sweats and like now.

84
00:05:50,964 --> 00:05:52,224
And yeah, so that's how it works.

85
00:05:52,284 --> 00:05:54,265
Unlimited swaps, unlimited visits.

86
00:05:54,648 --> 00:06:04,291
And we also have not to add more, but we also offer personal styling because that is a big, big piece for people in their confidence and trying new stuff.

87
00:06:05,412 --> 00:06:14,715
Um, and so when you have somebody who has an eye and who's trained in how to put together a look, that's gonna, you know, look great on you.

88
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:17,836
You are more willing to try things out.

89
00:06:18,383 --> 00:06:20,925
and you're just going to feel better, more confident about your day.

90
00:06:21,045 --> 00:06:25,548
And nevermind how much easier it is in the morning to throw on clothes because you already know what you're going to wear.

91
00:06:25,728 --> 00:06:27,550
Someone already created that outfit for you.

92
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:33,234
And you said when you were describing the business, you said it's for women plus.

93
00:06:33,254 --> 00:06:34,955
Can you just can you explain what you mean by that?

94
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:35,795
Sure.

95
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:40,299
So it's really for anyone who wears women's clothing.

96
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:42,340
So we've served the trans community.

97
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,464
We've served people that consider themselves crossdressers, anyone that wants to wear women's clothing.

98
00:06:48,963 --> 00:06:54,885
great that what you're describing about what it feels like to go shopping and sort of eliminating some of those barriers.

99
00:06:55,305 --> 00:06:56,245
That's really relatable.

100
00:06:56,485 --> 00:07:02,668
I wonder if you have like a sort of like what drove you to this or if there's like a personal drive here.

101
00:07:04,028 --> 00:07:04,488
Sure.

102
00:07:04,628 --> 00:07:12,991
So there definitely is, you know, like many businesses, we all created something to serve her like the challenges we were having in our own life.

103
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:19,511
Mine was sort of like these like parallel paths that for me that ended up like kind of crossing over.

104
00:07:19,611 --> 00:07:29,018
So, you know, I don't know, maybe at this point, like 15 years ago or something, I was living in New York city and I was like rising in my career in a nonprofit.

105
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:33,001
And I was really being seen more photographed more.

106
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,382
I was meeting elected officials.

107
00:07:34,422 --> 00:07:37,705
I was meeting million dollar donors, all these things.

108
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:41,788
And I was like, okay, like I look like, you know, not great.

109
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,411
And I had such a limited budget, you know, it was like my first or second year in the city.

110
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:53,534
And, you know, back then I was making, you know, 15 years ago I was making, I don't know, whatever, like nothing.

111
00:07:54,374 --> 00:08:02,297
And so I didn't really know how to like use, how to dress and how to like invest in pieces.

112
00:08:02,577 --> 00:08:10,021
And I just felt like I really needed to step up my game because I was meeting all these, you know, well-known people, photographed for,

113
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:17,680
know, newspapers, magazines, whatever, I was just being seen more speaking in front of large groups, and I wasn't feeling confident in how I was looking.

114
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:21,364
At the same time, I was so struggling with that.

115
00:08:21,404 --> 00:08:31,192
And then at the same time, I actually started this Greening Fellowship, where I was starting to really learn about, you know, environmental effects, harmful effects.

116
00:08:31,372 --> 00:08:35,957
And one thing that really, really stuck with me was the trash and our landfills.

117
00:08:36,477 --> 00:08:37,398
Because it's not just

118
00:08:37,937 --> 00:08:38,498
trash.

119
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:42,000
And I'll speak to New York because that's kind of where I was learning about it at the time.

120
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:46,905
But New York was trucking some of its trash like all the way to Michigan.

121
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:54,871
So now we're talking about, you know, all the like fumes from the trucks that are like driving hundreds of miles.

122
00:08:55,191 --> 00:08:58,774
We're talking about the actual land that it takes up, everything that seeps into the ground.

123
00:08:58,794 --> 00:09:04,219
We're talking about wasted tax dollars because we're literally driving trash like across state lines.

124
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:12,066
And just, there's like, it just go, like, just the trash thing, just like, it's the word, it snowballs, right?

125
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:15,768
Like, it's not just like trash in a landfill that you're just like, ah, whatever.

126
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:20,069
It's like a million other little effects, the greenhouse gases, everything.

127
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:24,411
And then when you're throwing something away, somebody is also like creating something new, right?

128
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:29,073
Like I threw away my T-shirt, so now I need a new T-shirt, because I'm not walking around topless, right?

129
00:09:29,713 --> 00:09:35,335
So I got really heavily into like the trash piece

130
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:43,551
And on my clothing side, I ended up investing a ton of money to work with a New York City stylist.

131
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:59,939
Me and my, he was my fiance at the time, my husband now, we were like, this is so important to you, to me, as I was feeling as a person, that we invested an incredible amount of money for us at the time, but we had a lot of conversations about it and just decided it was so important.

132
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:02,981
And I was like, honestly, I was a little underwhelmed by the results.

133
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:05,282
And I was like, I could do this better.

134
00:10:05,863 --> 00:10:09,325
And with the same learning about the trash, I was like, we could just do things differently.

135
00:10:09,365 --> 00:10:11,085
I was like, I don't want to have less clothes.

136
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:12,686
I don't want to look less nice.

137
00:10:12,886 --> 00:10:14,187
I just want to do it differently.

138
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:21,750
And I kind of realized, sorry, it's sort of a long story, but I kind of realized that one thing that worked for me a lot was borrowing clothes from friends.

139
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:29,214
Like not only were they, you know, they had different stuff than I did and I could just borrow it and give it back when I was done with it.

140
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:33,156
But they also like worked a little bit as like a second eye, a stylist, right?

141
00:10:33,196 --> 00:10:33,736
They were like,

142
00:10:34,122 --> 00:10:34,982
Oh, that looks good on you.

143
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:35,842
I think I might have this.

144
00:10:35,862 --> 00:10:36,623
That looks good on you.

145
00:10:37,383 --> 00:10:39,824
And I'm like, I was saying before then I like really swap.

146
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:44,885
It was just like a formalization of that process with real trained stylists who've gone to school.

147
00:10:44,925 --> 00:10:47,386
We have now a very specific swap it styling training.

148
00:10:47,406 --> 00:10:52,727
Cause we've, we've styled so many women that we understand what it's like to style someone for real life.

149
00:10:52,747 --> 00:10:54,968
We're not styling people for photo shoots or the red carpet.

150
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,788
We're styling you to go to the supermarket or pick up your kids from school.

151
00:10:57,808 --> 00:10:58,809
Um, and so.

152
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:03,121
And yeah, that's basically like how it all came together.

153
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:08,347
I was struggling with these two pieces and I was like, I can figure out a solution to this and doesn't swap.

154
00:11:08,388 --> 00:11:10,210
It was the solution that I came up with.

155
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:11,684
It's really brilliant.

156
00:11:11,864 --> 00:11:23,407
I'm hearing all these impacts, right, this sort of impact of the like interpersonal thing or like just the personal impact of how can I feel good about the way I look every day for a pretty low cost, right?

157
00:11:23,587 --> 00:11:28,929
And how is that having this sort of larger effect on, I think, our community, right?

158
00:11:28,969 --> 00:11:31,710
How are people connecting with each other around some of these things?

159
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:32,570
And

160
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:35,614
that environmental piece, which feels huge.

161
00:11:36,915 --> 00:11:40,296
So you said, so it sounds like, you know, there's a membership fee.

162
00:11:41,537 --> 00:11:43,757
Are there other ways that you generate income?

163
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:47,019
It sounds like that, you know, $147 membership might not sustain a full business, but yeah.

164
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:50,882
Yeah.

165
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,363
So there is with the membership, there is eventually a break even point.

166
00:11:54,423 --> 00:12:01,005
So it will at some point, but we have, um, we have the membership, we do special events.

167
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:03,925
So like I mentioned, like our all about pants event is coming up.

168
00:12:03,965 --> 00:12:04,986
We also will do.

169
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:12,548
Um, personal style, like you could get a personal styling sessions and, um, we do swap passes.

170
00:12:12,588 --> 00:12:17,629
So if you just want to like, check it out for a day or a month, you can sort of purchase just like a little trial.

171
00:12:18,313 --> 00:12:30,241
And we do all that stuff kind of limited throughout the year because we really want to encourage people to become full members and really like buy in literally and figuratively to the idea of the clothing swap.

172
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:36,565
And sometimes it takes more than one visit to really understand what it feels like, what it means in your life to just be able to like swap clothes.

173
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:43,529
And then we also, when people aren't members and they come into the store, we also will sell pieces too.

174
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,412
So if you're not a member and you don't have swaps, you can just purchase items.

175
00:12:47,802 --> 00:12:49,923
So we really have those three revenue streams.

176
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:53,165
Is there a cost to the styling that's separate from the membership?

177
00:12:54,686 --> 00:12:55,026
Yes.

178
00:12:55,406 --> 00:13:03,411
So for members, it is $30 to spend an hour with a stylist and then you still get all your swaps included.

179
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:06,833
So, you know, you're not, you're still not paying extra for clothes.

180
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:09,454
You just are paying for the stylist expertise and time.

181
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:15,478
Um, and then when we do a, like, so normally styling is just reserved for our members.

182
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:24,323
But occasionally we'll do a promotion where we let non-members do styling, and then that's $50 to come in for an hour and work with our stylist.

183
00:13:25,823 --> 00:13:29,305
So it sounds really accessible, and I'm sure a lot less than what you were describing paying in New York.

184
00:13:30,466 --> 00:13:32,787
It sounds like a hefty price.

185
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:35,568
One of our principles is to try to make it accessible for people.

186
00:13:35,928 --> 00:13:43,252
If you don't, then shopping secondhand isn't going to grow, and then it's not going to help people.

187
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:45,873
It's not going to make the impact that it needs to make.

188
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:59,744
Personal styling with the secondhand clothing is one of the most important pieces because a lot of times people will see something secondhand and they're like, oh, like, you know, I don't know if I think it looks great or it looks kind of dated or I don't know how to wear this, whatever.

189
00:13:59,904 --> 00:14:02,605
And that's where the stylist really comes in handy, right?

190
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,665
They can make something look more updated.

191
00:14:04,685 --> 00:14:06,246
They can make something look more like you.

192
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:09,767
They can give you ideas of different ways to style something, different ways to wear something.

193
00:14:09,827 --> 00:14:12,808
I mean, my entire wardrobe is from

194
00:14:13,893 --> 00:14:21,715
So if anyone has ever seen me out and about in the world and you like something I'm wearing, you will find something at Swap It that you will also love to wear.

195
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:27,176
I wonder if people ever see their own clothes on other people after going to Swap It.

196
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:36,457
Yes, that has, I don't know if like out and about, but in the store, it's definitely happened where someone's been checking out and someone like browsing, they're like, oh my God, that was mine.

197
00:14:36,537 --> 00:14:40,218
And those moments are like the biggest, most meaningful moments.

198
00:14:41,017 --> 00:14:43,378
It can be really hard to let go of your clothes, right?

199
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:49,922
Most of your clothes have meaning in some way or another, and it can be really hard to let go.

200
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:57,766
But when you see somebody else who looks great in it and who's gonna enjoy it, it feels so much easier and so much lighter to let those pieces go.

201
00:14:57,786 --> 00:15:00,068
Because you're like, great, it actually is going to a home.

202
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:05,711
We get so many people that are like, my stuff's too nice to throw in the clothing bin at the high school, right?

203
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:09,773
And that is not necessarily true.

204
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:29,240
true because like it's all you know it's all going someplace else but they feel like it's too nice to leave for just in a bin right so it feels so much better leaving it in a store where you see it on display and you know somebody's going to take it even though the stuff at the high school also the stuff that is good over there like it also goes to people it doesn't it doesn't wind up in the trash either so um

205
00:15:31,872 --> 00:15:32,632
Really interesting.

206
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:33,253
Yeah.

207
00:15:33,313 --> 00:15:36,654
It sounds like that's been a great experience to see that exchange for people.

208
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:43,277
Is there anything else that like has surprised you or is like a, has been, um, you know, a positive takeaway for you so far?

209
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,860
Um, I mean, two of the biggest things, one, you kind of touched on before is like that community aspect.

210
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:57,783
I was not expecting to create any kind of, like, it wasn't really a goal necessarily, like bring people together and create that, but

211
00:15:58,321 --> 00:16:14,387
The amount of connections that have been made in the store while people are swapping because you're in a place where you know that more or less people you know think like you or whatever and and it's a small space and we only let in no more than seven people at a time just for like a good experience.

212
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:22,807
And so people chat with each other and, you know, someone sent me a message the other day being like, Oh, like there's this woman that I sort of knew that was there and we were chatting.

213
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:24,608
We left as like friends and now we hang out.

214
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:27,609
And how many people like got their friends to sign up as members.

215
00:16:27,689 --> 00:16:29,289
And now like, that's what they do together.

216
00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:29,469
Right.

217
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:32,010
People have really limited time and energy.

218
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:39,392
So if you can hang out with a friend and get some clothes at the same time, like do something productive and see your friends, it's, it's really a win-win.

219
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:43,593
And so that's been like really, like really heartwarming to see.

220
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:51,022
Um, and then the other piece is that in our store, actually, we don't do anything by size.

221
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:55,283
So in a, when you go shopping anywhere else, you're like, oh, okay, here's size large.

222
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:56,204
That's my section.

223
00:16:56,244 --> 00:16:58,824
I will shop in this little box of large stuff.

224
00:16:59,645 --> 00:17:02,145
We don't do that for a number of reasons.

225
00:17:02,225 --> 00:17:07,187
And, um, largely because sizing doesn't mean anything.

226
00:17:07,427 --> 00:17:09,607
All the different brands have all the different sizes.

227
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:11,348
And if you're looking, looking at something from.

228
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:16,987
2017 versus 2021, like even those sizes are different, even in the same brand.

229
00:17:17,027 --> 00:17:19,747
So like, I just feel like it doesn't mean anything.

230
00:17:19,787 --> 00:17:23,989
We should start to understand our bodies, be able to hold something up and say, this looks like it might fit me.

231
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:30,991
And I think that's really important just to get in touch with like, you know, what your own body is.

232
00:17:31,251 --> 00:17:35,052
But, and while yes, we definitely get haters on that.

233
00:17:35,092 --> 00:17:37,553
Some people really don't like that we don't do things by size.

234
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:40,914
We have also opened up so many people

235
00:17:41,815 --> 00:17:52,323
to feeling less, not just restricted, but less like heavy from what size that they think they are, right?

236
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:58,048
Like if somebody thinks that there are 12, maybe they feel good about that, maybe they don't.

237
00:17:58,088 --> 00:18:06,915
But if they weren't feeling good about that, the fact that now they're like shopping in the 10s and shopping in the 14s, it doesn't matter anymore.

238
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:13,134
Because they're not like in this box of like, oh my goodness, I'm not happy being this size.

239
00:18:14,454 --> 00:18:17,576
And now I don't have to, I don't have to feel like I'm that size.

240
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,857
Cause I'm not shopping that size.

241
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:22,398
I'm looking at, I'm looking at everything and we've had it go both ways.

242
00:18:22,438 --> 00:18:26,360
We've had people that think they're extra larges and they literally leave in something a size small.

243
00:18:26,901 --> 00:18:30,643
And we've had tons of people that are smalls that will leave in size, extra larges.

244
00:18:30,763 --> 00:18:35,365
And everyone's like, I would never have seen this in a regular store because I wouldn't have gone to that section.

245
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,483
And that has been super powerful for people.

246
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:44,209
And I've heard from a lot of members now, once you get used to it, that they really like it.

247
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:50,916
And it really like makes them feel good and let's go of a lot of their like body images, a lot of their body image issues.

248
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:53,038
And that was also surprising to me, I think.

249
00:18:54,003 --> 00:18:58,407
It also seems like the lack of a price tag would have a similar impact.

250
00:18:58,447 --> 00:19:03,832
I've definitely been in a store where I've been like, well, I really like this thing, but this other thing is half the price, so I'm going to do that.

251
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:13,621
And that sort of not having to put a price tag on your self-worth or how you want to look, that seems really powerful and empowering too.

252
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:15,283
Definitely.

253
00:19:15,303 --> 00:19:19,727
And not thinking about those, I'm going to do air quotes, but those investment pieces.

254
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:26,203
that, you know, like, okay, I'm going to spend a lot of money on these pants because it's like an investment and they're going to last me forever.

255
00:19:26,343 --> 00:19:34,408
And then like two days later, you walk into like a chalkboard and they rip, you know, like it's just that kind of thinking is just, it's not swap it style.

256
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,490
It's like, get what you like, get, what's going to make you feel good.

257
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:42,294
And don't, don't have to be like, you don't have to be, um, you don't have to compromise, right?

258
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:47,217
When you don't have to compromise on your budget, you don't have to compromise on your style and you don't have to compromise on your value.

259
00:19:47,277 --> 00:19:48,698
And that's sort of the point of swapping.

260
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,688
Oh, and it sounds to you like the budget piece.

261
00:19:51,948 --> 00:19:59,572
You, if you're talking about a membership and maybe a few styling sessions, that's, that's your whole close budget minus, I assume, underwear for the year, right?

262
00:19:59,712 --> 00:20:02,273
And that's really useful, I think, for a lot of people.

263
00:20:03,514 --> 00:20:04,374
Yep, exactly.

264
00:20:04,575 --> 00:20:10,398
That, that's the goal is to make it accessible and just to make it so great that everyone just wants to be a part of it.

265
00:20:10,438 --> 00:20:10,658
Right.

266
00:20:10,678 --> 00:20:11,878
Sure.

267
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:14,460
You mentioned a couple of times the pants event.

268
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,521
I wonder if you want to say any more about that.

269
00:20:17,601 --> 00:20:17,961
Sure.

270
00:20:18,081 --> 00:20:18,422
So, um,

271
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:27,949
I guess I don't know exactly when you release these, but we are doing a special All About Pants event for members and non-members.

272
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:42,652
So if you're not a member, you're totally welcome to come to this on Friday, I guess tomorrow, Friday, April 8th, Saturday the 9th, April 12th and 13th, that Monday and Tuesday, maybe that's the 11th and 12th.

273
00:20:45,276 --> 00:20:52,219
Um, we're putting out all of our pants, basically our whole inventory of pants, and we will have stylists there to help you fit them.

274
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:53,720
Pants is something you have to like.

275
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,381
Commit to when you go to a store, cause you've got to try them on, you've got to be ready for it.

276
00:20:58,441 --> 00:21:06,225
So we were putting on this event so you could be in the right headspace and then literally have people that are going to help you find the right pants for your shape.

277
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:06,925
Talk you through them.

278
00:21:07,025 --> 00:21:11,167
Once you put them on, maybe you find something that's a little bit different than you normally wear.

279
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:14,148
So they can help you figure out what to like match with it on top.

280
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:21,034
It's just really to help you kind of get back into get back into the habit of having to wear pants.

281
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:24,116
It's not, it's not just zoom neck up anymore.

282
00:21:24,136 --> 00:21:25,557
Thank goodness.

283
00:21:26,648 --> 00:21:37,417
Yeah, I was chuckling when you were talking about the sort of switch to, I think, pajama bottoms all the time to then going back out in the world with the end, you know, going back after COVID.

284
00:21:37,437 --> 00:21:45,363
But so I don't think this will be released before that event, but it sounds like you do events similar to this throughout the year.

285
00:21:45,463 --> 00:21:48,085
So it's good to hear kind of what those look like.

286
00:21:48,826 --> 00:21:49,046
Yeah.

287
00:21:49,126 --> 00:21:51,848
And I would say that definitely.

288
00:21:51,968 --> 00:21:52,789
So on our website,

289
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:56,318
we have, it's a swappinggoodtime.com.

290
00:21:57,078 --> 00:21:59,980
And on the website, we have a button that says start for free.

291
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,521
And if you hit that button, you can sign up to get a free swap.

292
00:22:05,202 --> 00:22:11,764
And so you can, a free swap means you can come to the store, bring one item, take one item home, just kind of see what we're about.

293
00:22:11,944 --> 00:22:14,345
And it also signs you up for our email list.

294
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:21,008
So you will know when all of our good events are coming up, or hopefully you just come in, you love it, and you become a member.

295
00:22:21,836 --> 00:22:22,056
Thank you.

296
00:22:22,076 --> 00:22:26,279
That was one of my other questions was how to sort of keep in touch and how to hear about what you're doing.

297
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,361
So it sounds like your website, do you have a social media presence at all?

298
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:32,644
Yes, we're very active on Facebook.

299
00:22:32,764 --> 00:22:33,804
And that is the same.

300
00:22:34,305 --> 00:22:35,746
It's at a swapping good time.

301
00:22:35,766 --> 00:22:40,209
I can put those in our show notes too, so people can access them easier.

302
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,311
Is there anything else you want to make sure to mention about the business?

303
00:22:45,293 --> 00:22:47,034
I mean, I think we covered a lot of ground.

304
00:22:47,978 --> 00:22:49,038
I really appreciate it.

305
00:22:49,478 --> 00:22:55,360
I had a little bit of an idea about what we would talk about, but this has really been much more expansive than I thought.

306
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,060
I've learned a lot.

307
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,281
And thank you so much for doing it.

308
00:22:59,221 --> 00:23:00,182
Thank you for having me.

309
00:23:00,222 --> 00:23:02,962
And putting on this podcast, it's great to hear about all things Medford.

310
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:03,823
Thank you.

311
00:23:13,282 --> 00:23:14,583
Thank you so much to Stephanie.

312
00:23:15,164 --> 00:23:20,068
Check out today's show notes for a link to swap its website, as well as links to the pride t-shirt fundraiser.

313
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:23,131

00:23:42,414 --> 00:23:43,904
Guys, what's the name of the podcast?

318
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:44,890
Never Bites.

319
00:23:45,111 --> 00:23:46,762
Never Bites.

320
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:47,225
Good job.
