00:00:08,707 --> 00:00:12,529
April 15th, 2013 is a day no one will ever forget.

2
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:18,191
It was a day of horror and sorrow, but it also inspired a unified community and pride for our city.

3
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:22,913
April 16th was not your average game day for the Medford High varsity softball team.

4
00:00:23,073 --> 00:00:28,695
With yesterday's events fresh in their mind, one woman's story touched a girl's heart, and that was Crystal Campbell.

5
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:30,496
Crystal was a Medford High alum.

6
00:00:30,636 --> 00:00:32,198
And a former softball player.

7
00:00:32,318 --> 00:00:36,301
So the team thought that it was only fitting to dedicate the rest of their season to her.

8
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:40,645
Four softball seasons later, Medford High Softball continues to support Crystal.

9
00:00:40,705 --> 00:00:43,087
Through tournaments and selling Medford Strong t-shirts.

10
00:00:43,287 --> 00:00:45,809
And their proceeds go to the Crystal Campbell Scholarship Fund.

11
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:50,093
From then on, Medford Softball has done all in their power to carry on Crystal's legacy.

12
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:03,841
I will visit the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden and say a prayer.

13
00:01:07,745 --> 00:01:23,320
This garden is a fitting tribute to Crystal, Sunflower, Martin, Baseball Bro, Lindsey, Brooks, and Sean Badge.

14
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:37,349
In the days, weeks, and years following the horrific events, these families, first responders, and survivors have demonstrated pure strength by their actions and words.

15
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:44,295
I will attend the Boston Marathon to support the many runners who are trying to make a difference.

16
00:02:01,548 --> 00:02:05,591
We've been doing this for four years, the Medford Strong Motorcycle Run.

17
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:07,753
It was right by the Peace Garden.

18
00:02:11,976 --> 00:02:20,903
I'm going to make a difference in the Medford community by working with young adults every day to make Medford High School the best school.

19
00:02:23,404 --> 00:02:26,206
I'm going to make a difference by supporting my students to be successful.

20
00:02:28,328 --> 00:02:30,610
I will make a difference by making everyone around me smile.

21
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:35,599
I'm going to make a difference by praying for those in need.

22
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:46,161
I'm going to celebrate One Medford Day by honoring the victims of the Boston Marathon, particularly Crystal Campbell.

23
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:50,502
Purchase a Medford Strong t-shirt to support the Crystal Campbell Scholarship Fund.

24
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:56,024
I'm going to make a difference by doing random acts of kindness and making sure all the students at Medford High graduate.

25
00:02:56,284 --> 00:03:00,625
Take a moment of silence in honor of the Boston Marathon victims.

26
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:07,932
is I will get to know students, get to know as many students as I can, and support them and learn about them.

27
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:11,593
We will take a moment of silence to honor the Boston Marathon victims.

28
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:23,896
Take a moment of silence in honor of the Boston Marathon victims.

29
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:30,958
Make a donation to the Crystal Campbell Fund, and I challenge you to do the same thing.

30
00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:37,660
I'm going to make a difference by attending the softball tournament in the name of Crystal Campbell.

31
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,641
Mustangs on three.

32
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:42,481
One, two, three.

33
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:43,181
Mustangs!

34
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:56,026
A big part of Crystal's life was Medford High School and the activities that she participated in with the band and softball.

35
00:03:59,927 --> 00:04:01,468
We are Medford Strong.

36
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,887
We love you, Crystal!
