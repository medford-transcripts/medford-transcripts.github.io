1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:00,663
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2
00:00:00,763 --> 00:00:06,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome, everyone, to the May 2nd, 2024 meeting of the Medford Charter Study Committee.

3
00:00:07,648 --> 00:00:13,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Our first order of business is to review and accept the minutes from April 18th.

4
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:14,794
[SPEAKER_09]: Did everyone have a chance to see them?

5
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:16,955
[SPEAKER_08]: They looked good.

6
00:00:18,376 --> 00:00:19,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Motion to accept.

7
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:21,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Second.

8
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:23,200
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor?

9
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:24,861
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

10
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:25,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

11
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:27,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

12
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:30,175
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, then we can dive right in.

13
00:00:30,575 --> 00:00:32,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, OK, public participation.

14
00:00:33,618 --> 00:00:39,684
[SPEAKER_09]: So Ron was unable to come, but I don't know if you all had a chance to look at.

15
00:00:39,864 --> 00:00:41,546
[SPEAKER_09]: He was revising his proposal.

16
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:50,234
[SPEAKER_09]: And rather than proposing a committee to research the topic of including public participation,

17
00:00:53,459 --> 00:00:58,265
[SPEAKER_09]: He is suggesting an addition to the preamble and you have a chance to look at it.

18
00:00:58,285 --> 00:00:59,928
[SPEAKER_09]: I did.

19
00:01:00,488 --> 00:01:03,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we can open discussion on that.

20
00:01:08,274 --> 00:01:11,596
[SPEAKER_08]: I think as a statement of intent, it's fine.

21
00:01:11,836 --> 00:01:17,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure that right now, either the school committee or the city council would say, well, we do that anyway.

22
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:26,144
[SPEAKER_08]: But it certainly puts forth a statement saying it's of concern to us.

23
00:01:26,845 --> 00:01:27,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

24
00:01:33,045 --> 00:01:42,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in a preamble that is in general, very broad and a statement, I think of generic values.

25
00:01:42,834 --> 00:01:47,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it sticks out pretty weird, just like the writer brain.

26
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,604
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm not really sure that this is where it goes.

27
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:58,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also, as I understand it, there are.

28
00:01:59,603 --> 00:02:02,805
[SPEAKER_05]: very much on purpose, particular meetings, which can be private.

29
00:02:02,825 --> 00:02:07,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, I don't understand open meeting.

30
00:02:07,527 --> 00:02:09,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, executive session and things like that.

31
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:17,372
[SPEAKER_05]: And this seems like it pretty immediately creates some tension with that kind of thing.

32
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:17,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

33
00:02:20,112 --> 00:02:23,234
[SPEAKER_09]: It does, I think that it does say public city meetings.

34
00:02:23,374 --> 00:02:25,236
[SPEAKER_09]: So I, cause I thought of that as well.

35
00:02:25,316 --> 00:02:27,417
[SPEAKER_09]: And it does say public city meetings.

36
00:02:27,477 --> 00:02:30,359
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think by definition, those kinds of meetings are not public.

37
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:33,641
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think, but.

38
00:02:35,183 --> 00:02:39,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess in the end, what I'll just say is that I I'm personally against the inclusion of that.

39
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:45,830
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't strike me as necessary or appropriate at the very least in this section, possibly in general.

40
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

41
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,922
[SPEAKER_08]: So someplace else where we could put it.

42
00:02:53,724 --> 00:03:09,773
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think if it's, if what we're talking about here is city meetings about like, I think you could certainly stick it in a two, three or eight.

43
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:28,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, or the charter, the school committee section or the city council section two or an eight and just kind of eight, I think is the public.

44
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:41,387
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're going to be looking at, hopefully we're going to be looking at article eight tonight, but we'll say, um, so just sort of a statement of intent in article eight, uh, possibly.

45
00:03:41,547 --> 00:03:41,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

46
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:42,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Gene.

47
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.

48
00:03:48,514 --> 00:03:52,875
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the one that suggested Ron consider this instead of.

49
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:58,016
[SPEAKER_01]: Creating rules around the meetings.

50
00:03:59,076 --> 00:04:02,697
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like how many minutes people have to speak and stuff for the Charter.

51
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:05,798
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

52
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:11,699
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I, I think it, I think it to me it fits here.

53
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:14,020
[SPEAKER_01]: I I had a concern about strongly.

54
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:30,569
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we don't strongly believe other, I don't know, the lawyer in me was like, sometimes when you put modifiers like strongly on something, then people think that's more important than other things.

55
00:04:31,269 --> 00:04:43,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was a little concerned that strongly believe, when we don't strongly believe in equity, inclusivity, or civic engagement,

56
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:53,628
[SPEAKER_01]: that piece stuck out to me is sort of highlighting one piece of the preamble, not the other pieces.

57
00:04:53,768 --> 00:04:55,470
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, I'm okay with the statement.

58
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:01,814
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually had it on my, that was one of my proposals was to delete strongly.

59
00:05:03,755 --> 00:05:05,716
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hear you.

60
00:05:06,177 --> 00:05:08,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Melva, can you put it up as we're talking?

61
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:10,740
[SPEAKER_08]: I read it earlier, but I didn't print it.

62
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:16,041
[SPEAKER_09]: Arne, I got everything ready to put up, and I think I didn't get that.

63
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:16,802
[SPEAKER_09]: But let me see.

64
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:17,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I should be able to.

65
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:22,283
[SPEAKER_09]: While I'm fetching it, Eunice, I think you had your hand up.

66
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:23,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

67
00:05:23,964 --> 00:05:24,564
[SPEAKER_04]: Just put it up.

68
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:27,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.

69
00:05:28,205 --> 00:05:28,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

70
00:05:29,485 --> 00:05:38,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that anything that is some sort of value statement or a suggestion like this,

71
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:43,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I think really is pretty watered down.

72
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:47,778
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I, I don't think that.

73
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,122
[SPEAKER_04]: I think all this stuff in the preamble is certainly nice to have.

74
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:56,407
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think anybody is going to give it a whole lot of consideration.

75
00:05:56,468 --> 00:05:59,331
[SPEAKER_04]: Quite frankly, I think if.

76
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:16,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless we are legislating something within the charter, like we are legislating mostly everything else, like, you know, we have, you know, counselors and school committee members will have, you know, two-year terms.

77
00:06:17,608 --> 00:06:20,969
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor has a four-year term, term limits.

78
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:23,829
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, unless we're putting something in,

79
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:32,242
[SPEAKER_04]: that is a specific requirement that this is how our city government works.

80
00:06:33,203 --> 00:06:34,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I really think it means nothing.

81
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:56,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if you were to put this, if this charter with this statement or a similar statement in it, whether it be in the preamble or any other place within, as Daveed might suggest, where we strongly believe that public participation matters basically,

82
00:06:56,937 --> 00:07:00,540
[SPEAKER_04]: Is what it's saying without specific.

83
00:07:02,782 --> 00:07:09,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Requirements for it if this if this charter were to pass tomorrow and go into law next week.

84
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:21,003
[SPEAKER_04]: With that in it, does anybody really think that the public engagement situation in Medford would change in any meaningful way?

85
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

86
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:36,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that unless we put in specifics of how our elected officials are to behave and adhere to, then anything like this means absolutely nothing.

87
00:07:36,828 --> 00:07:37,068
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

88
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:40,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I say something?

89
00:07:42,124 --> 00:07:42,986
[SPEAKER_09]: Anthony, is that you?

90
00:07:43,468 --> 00:07:44,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it's me.

91
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Anthony, and then Phyllis.

92
00:07:47,698 --> 00:07:50,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of agree with Eunice in the sense that, you know,

93
00:07:52,135 --> 00:08:04,203
[SPEAKER_03]: to kind of put this language in without having the ability to kind of have any real teeth is really unnecessary.

94
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:16,390
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've already finalized the preamble and to add this language just to kind of make a statement to the city council is,

95
00:08:17,871 --> 00:08:19,012
[SPEAKER_03]: is unnecessary.

96
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:22,893
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, uh, city council makes the rules.

97
00:08:23,573 --> 00:08:28,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, school committee makes the rules, how they operate and how they conduct themselves.

98
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,895
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't need to be in the charter.

99
00:08:31,915 --> 00:08:42,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, should we expect the city council and the school committee to, you know, allow for public participation?

100
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:44,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, yeah.

101
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:46,140
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and they have, and they,

102
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:51,186
[SPEAKER_03]: are and they have rules and they'll modify them.

103
00:08:51,246 --> 00:08:58,236
[SPEAKER_03]: The next city council might change it back to five minutes or 10 minutes or maybe change it to one minute.

104
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:00,759
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really up to them.

105
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:03,338
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it belongs in the charter.

106
00:09:03,378 --> 00:09:07,502
[SPEAKER_03]: The charter is the kind of, you know, the framework.

107
00:09:08,462 --> 00:09:10,124
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're the elected officials.

108
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:14,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, you know, the ball is in their court at that point.

109
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:16,369
[SPEAKER_03]: It's their meetings.

110
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:19,211
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think it needs to be in the charter.

111
00:09:19,912 --> 00:09:22,314
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just the way I feel.

112
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:23,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

113
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:24,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Phyllis.

114
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:30,349
[SPEAKER_09]: She's muted.

115
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:31,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

116
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,090
[SPEAKER_09]: Hang on, Phyllis.

117
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:33,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Wait a minute.

118
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,930
[SPEAKER_09]: You're muted.

119
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:39,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm sorry.

120
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:40,851
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I had muted you.

121
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought I had muted you, co-host.

122
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:42,851
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm really sorry.

123
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:43,771
[SPEAKER_07]: That's OK.

124
00:09:44,032 --> 00:09:46,652
[SPEAKER_07]: But it said that I couldn't unmute myself.

125
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:47,412
[SPEAKER_07]: You had to do it.

126
00:09:47,812 --> 00:09:48,492
[SPEAKER_07]: You should be fine.

127
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:50,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think the statement belongs in there at all.

128
00:09:53,373 --> 00:09:54,833
[SPEAKER_07]: I see no reason for it.

129
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:57,754
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the statement before it is just perfect.

130
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:59,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree.

131
00:10:00,234 --> 00:10:01,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them run their own meetings.

132
00:10:01,755 --> 00:10:03,496
[SPEAKER_07]: Let them do that the way they do.

133
00:10:04,097 --> 00:10:09,942
[SPEAKER_07]: We are not supposed to be micromanaging anybody.

134
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:17,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Before that sentence that you read, just I saw highlighted, I think we just leave it there.

135
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:20,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't agree that that should be included.

136
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:24,114
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, Aubrey.

137
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:36,326
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'm aligned with most of you with not including this, but I do see places where we have values that are more broad that might include this.

138
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:47,396
[SPEAKER_10]: So I feel like even without this red sentence that is like wishing to participate fully in a government that's responsive and serves residents needs might cover the red sentence.

139
00:10:52,982 --> 00:10:53,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

140
00:10:54,253 --> 00:10:57,094
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm sorry, I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying.

141
00:10:57,134 --> 00:11:05,456
[SPEAKER_09]: You're saying you think that it already includes this, we include this in the preamble already with the language that's there.

142
00:11:05,616 --> 00:11:06,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

143
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:07,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Daveed?

144
00:11:08,137 --> 00:11:12,858
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to make a motion to reject this edit.

145
00:11:15,118 --> 00:11:19,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so we're going to, okay, that's, and Anthony Seconds?

146
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:20,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

147
00:11:21,324 --> 00:11:21,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

148
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,986
[SPEAKER_09]: So a yes vote means that we do not want to include this in the preamble.

149
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:34,229
[SPEAKER_09]: And a no vote means that we may want to include it as is or edited.

150
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

151
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Eunice.

152
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:42,033
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to reiterate and to make myself perfectly clear,

153
00:11:44,182 --> 00:11:52,606
[SPEAKER_04]: I will vote to include it because it's better than nothing, which seems to be the alternative and seems to be the wish here.

154
00:11:54,626 --> 00:12:07,471
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'll be clear that I think that whatever should be in the charter has to be far more specific and has to legislate, and yes, micromanage.

155
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:11,393
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll say it, micromanage how public participation is

156
00:12:12,803 --> 00:12:16,764
[SPEAKER_04]: Handled by our elected bodies because I don't think it's being handled properly.

157
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:22,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, just this week, the community was silenced once again at a meeting.

158
00:12:22,565 --> 00:12:22,885
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

159
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:27,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I will vote to include it because basically it's.

160
00:12:28,827 --> 00:12:31,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Better than nothing, but.

161
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:34,088
[SPEAKER_04]: In my view that.

162
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:41,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Just like all of the other stuff that we have put in the charter that are basically requirements for how.

163
00:12:42,824 --> 00:12:53,326
[SPEAKER_04]: government is handled, that something more should be in here to legislate how they work with public participation.

164
00:12:54,226 --> 00:12:57,267
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that's my view.

165
00:12:58,007 --> 00:12:59,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you.

166
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:05,469
[SPEAKER_09]: So, that is a no vote in the way this motion is configured.

167
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:07,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Paula?

168
00:13:08,834 --> 00:13:17,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to vote yes, not to include it, but I am open to trying to figure out where else to include something.

169
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,081
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it belongs here, but I think it belongs.

170
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:21,822
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

171
00:13:22,162 --> 00:13:22,523
[SPEAKER_09]: Aubrey?

172
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:23,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

173
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:25,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean?

174
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:33,189
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to vote no, because I recommended Ron do this, and he did it, and I'm going to stick with him.

175
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:34,830
[SPEAKER_01]: Phyllis?

176
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:35,851
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

177
00:13:37,292 --> 00:13:37,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Daveed?

178
00:13:38,627 --> 00:13:38,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

179
00:13:41,108 --> 00:13:41,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Anthony.

180
00:13:43,109 --> 00:13:48,412
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to clarify, yes means not to include it, is that correct?

181
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:53,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, that is correct.

182
00:13:53,594 --> 00:13:54,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

183
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so that's a yes.

184
00:13:56,936 --> 00:14:00,617
[SPEAKER_09]: I will also vote no.

185
00:14:01,978 --> 00:14:03,278
[SPEAKER_09]: So this motion carries.

186
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:08,848
[SPEAKER_09]: So we voted not to include this in the preamble.

187
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:11,370
[SPEAKER_09]: There was talk of potentially including it somewhere else.

188
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:17,015
[SPEAKER_09]: If anybody wants to follow up on that and make a proposal at the next meeting, feel free.

189
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:23,160
[SPEAKER_09]: But right now, we're going to move on to our next agenda item, which is school committee.

190
00:14:25,377 --> 00:14:25,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Article four.

191
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:33,364
[SPEAKER_09]: So because there's so much material in here, I thought it would be, you know, if we broke it up, it would make it a little easier.

192
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:36,747
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thought we could start by with the basic composition.

193
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:41,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me put it up on the screen.

194
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:50,560
[SPEAKER_09]: And have you all reviewed the document?

195
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:51,932
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

196
00:14:52,572 --> 00:15:00,615
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, we had some notes on it from the call-in center as well.

197
00:15:01,595 --> 00:15:01,755
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

198
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:16,119
[SPEAKER_09]: So the way that we're working this is to, if people have a specific proposal that they want to make on this text, the floor is open.

199
00:15:18,904 --> 00:15:23,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So I didn't really get to do a good job reading through it before this.

200
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:36,620
[SPEAKER_05]: But my understanding was that like the one thing it seemed like everybody was in agreement on in terms of our surveys, in terms of talking to city councilors, was removing the mayor from the school committee.

201
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,182
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I do.

202
00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:39,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to get to that.

203
00:15:40,217 --> 00:15:44,200
[SPEAKER_09]: But I want to do composition first, because mayor's role is next.

204
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, David.

205
00:15:46,422 --> 00:15:48,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I was just looking at all of 418.

206
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:49,344
[SPEAKER_09]: That's OK.

207
00:15:49,384 --> 00:15:49,884
[SPEAKER_09]: That's OK.

208
00:15:50,525 --> 00:15:55,248
[SPEAKER_09]: So I wanted to just see if everybody was in agreement about the composition.

209
00:15:55,288 --> 00:16:00,572
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I have mayor's role, and then term of office, and then kind of the remaining text.

210
00:16:00,972 --> 00:16:01,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that OK?

211
00:16:02,415 --> 00:16:03,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

212
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:03,375
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

213
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:09,297
[SPEAKER_09]: So composition, what's been suggested is what you see.

214
00:16:09,857 --> 00:16:13,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Jean, you have a comment?

215
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:19,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm fine with the combined wards, so four combined wards.

216
00:16:20,361 --> 00:16:23,862
[SPEAKER_01]: And the call and center feedback is that we have to name the wards.

217
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:24,762
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

218
00:16:26,323 --> 00:16:28,824
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have to be careful that we don't

219
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:47,543
[SPEAKER_01]: violate voting rights law by diluting a ward that is majority minority or so that that's the only thing that I just haven't I don't know if Lowell or other cities did Lowell combine

220
00:16:49,764 --> 00:16:59,571
[SPEAKER_09]: The only ones I know of that have done this are Lowell and Worcester, and they did both hire consultants to divide up the wards.

221
00:17:00,391 --> 00:17:16,263
[SPEAKER_09]: They were both dealing with lawsuits, so they were considering that kind of thing, the composition of the wards, in addition to just the legal questions, which we would have to consider that they have to be contiguous and they have to be roughly equal in population.

222
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, go ahead.

223
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I continue?

224
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:21,680
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead.

225
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:21,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

226
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we know we have one minority majority ward.

227
00:17:25,381 --> 00:17:28,902
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you combine it, it's diluting that ward.

228
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:34,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I just don't know what the impact of that would be.

229
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:38,306
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something we should consider, I guess, before we decide on that.

230
00:17:38,326 --> 00:17:40,367
[SPEAKER_09]: No, thank you for that point.

231
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:44,068
[SPEAKER_09]: Paulette, did you want to say something because you were part of the process?

232
00:17:44,515 --> 00:17:48,878
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, so I just want to back up a little bit and explain why we got to this.

233
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,681
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now, everybody's at large.

234
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:58,704
[SPEAKER_08]: Lots of concern from many people at large.

235
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:12,412
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we went the other way, which of course is an option, and like the city council, do one from every ward, the concern was that there was not necessarily

236
00:18:13,908 --> 00:18:23,615
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't feel as secure that it would break out as evenly, that there would be people in every ward who was interested being in the school committee.

237
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:28,219
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a little bit more defined interest.

238
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:40,173
[SPEAKER_08]: So for that reason, and also looking at what the two cities did that were faced with the lawsuits.

239
00:18:40,394 --> 00:18:48,640
[SPEAKER_08]: And once we received the information about the lawsuits, when we saw the second one with Worcester, we said, OK, we're going to have to do something different.

240
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,063
[SPEAKER_08]: It's only a matter of time before this would be raised in Medford.

241
00:18:55,084 --> 00:18:59,027
[SPEAKER_08]: I absolutely believe it would be easier to just say, OK, one from every ward.

242
00:18:59,768 --> 00:19:05,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I personally don't understand why the Collins Center said we, this committee, needs to identify it.

243
00:19:06,553 --> 00:19:13,178
[SPEAKER_08]: We are suggesting that this is the ideal way to go about it.

244
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:17,943
[SPEAKER_08]: We received a—Ron wrote the elections committee.

245
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:21,868
[SPEAKER_08]: We had included that, which said, absolutely, we can do this.

246
00:19:23,189 --> 00:19:29,637
[SPEAKER_08]: It certainly is not my intent, personally, that I or the subcommittee would be

247
00:19:30,418 --> 00:19:34,060
[SPEAKER_08]: have the expertise to go about and define the boards.

248
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,861
[SPEAKER_08]: We're saying, look, we think ideally this is the way it should go.

249
00:19:37,602 --> 00:19:44,285
[SPEAKER_08]: And then there are going to be people who are much more knowledgeable about this stuff than we are to make that happen.

250
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:49,668
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I saw Collin's note, I was kind of like, wait a second.

251
00:19:51,389 --> 00:19:58,693
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what they're saying is that what, so we're, you know, one of the decisions we made was to create a draft charter and any,

252
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:07,138
[SPEAKER_09]: if this were to be implemented, the awards would have to be defined in the charter.

253
00:20:07,278 --> 00:20:10,399
[SPEAKER_09]: And since we're creating a draft charter, I think that's what they mean.

254
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:22,661
[SPEAKER_09]: It is possible that we could leave it blank and leave an addendum and say somebody else will have to figure this out, but... Well, it also might change over time.

255
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but they have to be defined, and I think they do have to be defined in the charter.

256
00:20:29,148 --> 00:20:30,092
[SPEAKER_08]: So what if they change?

257
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:31,517
[SPEAKER_08]: What if the population changes?

258
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,747
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, then the number of wards changed.

259
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:40,249
[SPEAKER_09]: And then that would have to change, I imagine, that section of the charter.

260
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:40,669
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

261
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:58,697
[SPEAKER_08]: So if it has to change, wouldn't you put a sentence in something to the effect of saying the composition of the wards would be determined by x and x seeking outside help or whatever the city council would, you know, I mean,

262
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:08,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I just can't see that we are going to have the expertise to say, I think it should be Ward 1 and Ward 5 and Ward 3 and Ward 7.

263
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:10,382
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that doesn't make any sense to me.

264
00:21:10,642 --> 00:21:13,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's why Worcester and Lowell hired consultants, I think.

265
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:25,089
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you're uncomfortable, I mean, if the group overall is saying, well, it might be the best way, but we're just, we're not comfortable with it.

266
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,230
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's fine.

267
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:34,471
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we went through a process of discussion, belabored discussion, I should say, to come up with this.

268
00:21:35,132 --> 00:21:36,412
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not the easiest one.

269
00:21:39,407 --> 00:21:50,770
[SPEAKER_08]: And because of that, also, it follows through in terms of, you know, if someone leaves a seat, whatever, there's more language that's more complicated.

270
00:21:51,211 --> 00:21:54,812
[SPEAKER_08]: So if people want to reject it on the basis of saying, oh, it's just too complicated.

271
00:21:55,172 --> 00:22:00,093
[SPEAKER_08]: But on the other hand, you charged us with trying to come up with what would be the best.

272
00:22:01,462 --> 00:22:08,766
[SPEAKER_08]: for ensuring that there was a school committee that was both functional and representative.

273
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:09,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

274
00:22:13,296 --> 00:22:27,143
[SPEAKER_05]: One suggestion I think that could make all of this much simpler is simply to put in a very well-defined, relatively easy, but not trivial method for changing which wards it is, right?

275
00:22:27,223 --> 00:22:33,726
[SPEAKER_05]: So we say, you know, those wards may be changed by like a special act of the council or something.

276
00:22:33,746 --> 00:22:36,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that will align with law.

277
00:22:37,128 --> 00:22:37,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think it would.

278
00:22:38,782 --> 00:22:42,126
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, only be redistrict every 10 years.

279
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:43,167
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's a very.

280
00:22:44,688 --> 00:22:51,195
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so maybe maybe 10 years when the redistricting happens, you give the city council a choice.

281
00:22:52,216 --> 00:22:53,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Either way, it seems like.

282
00:22:54,258 --> 00:23:09,999
[SPEAKER_05]: there must be some way that we can choose which wards they are now and leave a straightforward, well-defined way for somebody to change those wards going forward without having to amend the Charter, is all I'm suggesting.

283
00:23:11,134 --> 00:23:23,599
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wouldn't give the city council the ability to change that because it maybe the school committee maybe you know the school committee in Maybe it's like the school committee the mayor and the city council all have to agree on it.

284
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:40,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know i'm not sure that would fly either because um making that that would be A change the kind of change to the charter that I don't think could be done that way I think it would it would have to follow a more strict uh process um

285
00:23:42,238 --> 00:23:47,701
[SPEAKER_03]: It also would involve the state because, you know, it also involves, you know, a state reps and state senators.

286
00:23:48,221 --> 00:23:50,922
[SPEAKER_03]: It's they go by the same words.

287
00:23:51,803 --> 00:23:55,725
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to it's not up to the city at all.

288
00:23:56,165 --> 00:23:57,326
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really up to the state.

289
00:23:58,206 --> 00:24:01,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm saying which words are combined.

290
00:24:02,248 --> 00:24:04,930
[SPEAKER_05]: Seems like it should be relatively easy.

291
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:11,113
[SPEAKER_05]: But you all clearly understand the law and the multiple layers here better.

292
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:18,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, theoretically, the wards are all about the same population.

293
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:24,303
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, contiguous wards makes the most sense.

294
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:29,147
[SPEAKER_08]: I still would hesitate to suggest that.

295
00:24:29,207 --> 00:24:35,512
[SPEAKER_08]: I would think that if we're going to put this in, it would require an expert coming in.

296
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:42,298
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, all we did was we found out that this was definitely in our purview to say this.

297
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:51,988
[SPEAKER_08]: But apart from that, to me, they're clearly then saying that these will be created by outside expertise.

298
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:55,170
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, Aubrey?

299
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:03,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you help me understand when in the process we would have to have that final decision?

300
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:04,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Well,

301
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:32,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Ideally, it would be part of the draft that we would submit if we're, you know, I mean, we could, I mean, we can talk to the call-in center about this, and we could submit it as a recommendation and then leave it in the hands of somebody else to decide, possibly, and just say this is what we recommend, but we,

302
00:25:34,717 --> 00:25:38,780
[SPEAKER_09]: But we feel that it should be decided by somebody who has the knowledge.

303
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:47,265
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the other question I would like to ask the Collins Center is, we know that there are cities that have done this.

304
00:25:48,686 --> 00:25:49,467
[SPEAKER_09]: We know of two.

305
00:25:49,487 --> 00:25:50,988
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there might be three.

306
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:56,912
[SPEAKER_09]: But I don't know, you know, at the Statehouse how they will receive it.

307
00:25:57,032 --> 00:26:08,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Like what, so I would like to find out, you know, is the Statehouse going to want to see, okay, we want to see documentation that you combine these wards in alignment with the law, for example.

308
00:26:10,321 --> 00:26:14,364
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something, you know, that we would, but we can look at that down the road.

309
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:15,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Jean?

310
00:26:17,406 --> 00:26:19,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing I was thinking is we have,

311
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:21,888
[SPEAKER_01]: three elementary schools.

312
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:37,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you put the ward maps over where they draw their students from, because that seems like that would be a place you could start.

313
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:49,109
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those are contiguous, and there's more sense of community by your elementary school, for the most part.

314
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:56,370
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you could have three combined wards to go with the elementary schools.

315
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,371
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just one thought I was having.

316
00:26:58,751 --> 00:27:00,931
[SPEAKER_08]: There's four elementary schools.

317
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:02,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's four.

318
00:27:02,151 --> 00:27:03,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Who am I leaving out?

319
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:03,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Brooks?

320
00:27:04,112 --> 00:27:04,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the McGlynn.

321
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:08,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the McGlynn, okay, so there's four.

322
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:12,199
[SPEAKER_08]: But they do not break evenly in any group.

323
00:27:12,259 --> 00:27:13,821
[SPEAKER_08]: We started out by looking at that.

324
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:15,082
[SPEAKER_01]: You did, okay.

325
00:27:15,362 --> 00:27:15,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

326
00:27:16,884 --> 00:27:20,528
[SPEAKER_01]: But they don't overlap with the ward maps evenly?

327
00:27:22,089 --> 00:27:25,032
[SPEAKER_03]: So if the children don't go to class and they're

328
00:27:25,983 --> 00:27:36,262
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily in the area, you know, there might be someone at the Brooks from East Medford and yeah, you know, so it.

329
00:27:38,353 --> 00:27:38,853
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that.

330
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:40,413
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets real complicated.

331
00:27:40,913 --> 00:27:42,934
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's mostly neighborhood.

332
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:47,595
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I sent my son to a school that was not in the assigned school.

333
00:27:48,535 --> 00:27:52,455
[SPEAKER_01]: But most of the kids in the neighborhood went to the Roberts.

334
00:27:55,236 --> 00:27:58,617
[SPEAKER_02]: But who would you say who would be in it?

335
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:03,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but these aren't precise things.

336
00:28:03,157 --> 00:28:06,438
[SPEAKER_01]: At my ward, the combined ward person would still be

337
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,650
[SPEAKER_01]: around the Roberts, even though I live here.

338
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:16,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not looking for, but it sounds like you already looked at that, Paulette, and it didn't.

339
00:28:17,234 --> 00:28:29,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think tying it to the schools really work, because if you go a little bit further, you've got the McGlynn Middle School right next to the McGlynn Elementary.

340
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,301
[SPEAKER_08]: So you've got that one.

341
00:28:31,361 --> 00:28:35,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Those wards have two schools, while others would not have any.

342
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:48,229
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, the reason why I always why I argued for at large was because it meant that every school committee member was responsible for every student, no matter where they went to school.

343
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:59,156
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, now I've moved as a part of this process and said, OK, every school committee member will still represent every

344
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:02,999
[SPEAKER_08]: member of this community.

345
00:29:03,019 --> 00:29:12,166
[SPEAKER_08]: I am fearful that some will think, well, this is the school in my ward, so that's, you know, I mean, that's a concern.

346
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:17,731
[SPEAKER_08]: But we're going to be magnanimous and believe that all people are doing it for all students.

347
00:29:20,233 --> 00:29:29,841
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, again, the trip up for going to just ward representation was right now, for example, I think it's four or five

348
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:34,788
[SPEAKER_08]: school committee members all live in the same ward right now.

349
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:40,613
[SPEAKER_08]: And it doesn't break evenly.

350
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,374
[SPEAKER_08]: But it would be easier.

351
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,196
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no doubt about it that it would be easier.

352
00:29:44,236 --> 00:29:47,638
[SPEAKER_08]: We just couldn't guarantee from our discussions or thoughts.

353
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I know in Somerville, they have ward representation, and it does work.

354
00:29:52,682 --> 00:29:53,983
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe people step up.

355
00:29:56,131 --> 00:30:06,676
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the concern usually is that people who are running for school committee have very particular interest in education.

356
00:30:08,116 --> 00:30:14,539
[SPEAKER_08]: And the thing, of course, that we don't want to have happen is people running because they think, oh, boy, I can go collect that stipend.

357
00:30:17,387 --> 00:30:18,608
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I ask you a question, please?

358
00:30:19,329 --> 00:30:19,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, go ahead.

359
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:40,470
[SPEAKER_03]: As part of your consideration, did you ever look into having, instead of being elected to, say, a district that, say, the school committee would assign people to a school, like, you know what I mean, kind of let, you know, like, have like a process

360
00:30:40,931 --> 00:30:54,926
[SPEAKER_03]: within the school committee to say, you know, you're in charge of zone A, you're B, you're C, so they would represent, you know, they would be like the go-to people for the people from that district, so.

361
00:30:56,405 --> 00:31:06,952
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, kind of on something that the city council would decide rather than, you know, have it be part of the election.

362
00:31:07,352 --> 00:31:12,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the reason I'm saying that is because I understand what you're trying to do, and I agree with it.

363
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:19,580
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, if you do these districts for a school committee, but we don't do them for city council,

364
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you're going to have ward elections and district elections.

365
00:31:24,542 --> 00:31:37,567
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe, you know, there's a preliminary election in the ward here or a district there and, you know, not elections in other areas.

366
00:31:38,047 --> 00:31:41,669
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it would make it more confusing.

367
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:44,170
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if having like

368
00:31:45,622 --> 00:31:48,664
[SPEAKER_03]: it just be assigned by the school committee.

369
00:31:49,144 --> 00:32:01,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the West Medford School Committee person and somebody else is the East Medford School Committee representative and have them delegate who that person is.

370
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:10,240
[SPEAKER_08]: The budget of the schools doesn't talk, it's for the whole school system.

371
00:32:10,581 --> 00:32:24,473
[SPEAKER_08]: And the one thing that you really don't want to have on the school committee, at all potential costs, is you don't want to have people identifying with one school over another, one set of kids over the other.

372
00:32:25,518 --> 00:32:37,288
[SPEAKER_08]: You want every one of your elected school committee members to care the same about the kid at the Missituck versus the kid at the McGlynn or the kid at the Brooks or the kid at the high school.

373
00:32:38,209 --> 00:32:48,537
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, Anthony, to answer you, I can only say, gee, they managed to figure it out in Lowell and they managed to figure it out in Worcester.

374
00:32:49,418 --> 00:32:51,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we might have to pay to figure it out.

375
00:32:53,751 --> 00:33:00,873
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we're redoing this and you're asking us what's the ideal, this is what we think the ideal is.

376
00:33:02,233 --> 00:33:11,975
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, I see the committee either saying, no, we don't wanna deal with that at all or we're just gonna go do the exact same thing that the city councilors do and we don't care what the distinction is between the two bodies.

377
00:33:15,256 --> 00:33:20,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I wanna hear from Aubrey and then I think it might be a good time to just sort of

378
00:33:21,652 --> 00:33:29,094
[SPEAKER_09]: take a vote on the committee to see where we stand on this particular configuration, this composition.

379
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:30,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead, Aubrey.

380
00:33:30,995 --> 00:33:34,596
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to share a resource because I know at one point we made a map.

381
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:40,417
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was in the drive and I can... Yeah, I'll start my share.

382
00:33:41,297 --> 00:33:41,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

383
00:33:41,617 --> 00:33:45,719
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you see?

384
00:33:47,379 --> 00:33:48,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

385
00:33:48,579 --> 00:33:50,640
[SPEAKER_10]: So the black dots are schools.

386
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:53,176
[SPEAKER_10]: and then the wards.

387
00:33:56,778 --> 00:33:58,820
[SPEAKER_10]: It's 8-1 and 8-2, but.

388
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

389
00:34:03,263 --> 00:34:07,446
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a whole swath of the city that doesn't have a school in it.

390
00:34:07,466 --> 00:34:10,248
[SPEAKER_10]: And 2 and close.

391
00:34:10,688 --> 00:34:12,689
[SPEAKER_10]: These would be the same old part.

392
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:17,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Very close, yeah.

393
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:20,095
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so I want us to

394
00:34:21,451 --> 00:34:24,333
[SPEAKER_09]: see where we're at with this.

395
00:34:25,594 --> 00:34:27,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, Danielle, Danielle just arrived.

396
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:40,445
[SPEAKER_09]: We're about to, I mean, first of all, let me just say, is there anybody who wants to propose an alternate composition for the school committee?

397
00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:45,969
[SPEAKER_09]: David.

398
00:34:46,864 --> 00:34:56,859
[SPEAKER_05]: But only in so far as I would add a third at large candidate to replace the mayor, but we can talk about that when we move on to the mayor's bit if that makes sense.

399
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:57,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

400
00:34:58,562 --> 00:34:59,463
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um,

401
00:35:01,412 --> 00:35:12,384
[SPEAKER_09]: So since nobody has proposed an alternate composition, I think that I don't necessarily, I think we're going to end up sort of voting on the whole text.

402
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:17,409
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we need to actually vote because there's no changes that anybody is proposing.

403
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:19,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in terms of,

404
00:35:21,943 --> 00:35:26,966
[SPEAKER_09]: how to write this into the charter when we do the drafting.

405
00:35:27,046 --> 00:35:28,667
[SPEAKER_09]: The Collins Center can help us with that.

406
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:44,017
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe we can talk to the Collins Center about if there are resources that can help us figure out how to combine the awards or whether it's better to leave them, sort of just leave this as a recommendation.

407
00:35:45,658 --> 00:35:45,898
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

408
00:35:48,335 --> 00:35:53,456
[SPEAKER_06]: Since everybody seems to be in agreement on that, let's move on to... Sorry, Mova.

409
00:35:53,676 --> 00:35:56,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So everyone's agreeing to the combined awards idea?

410
00:35:57,017 --> 00:35:59,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, unless you have something to say.

411
00:36:00,137 --> 00:36:14,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I did miss it, but the question, like what you already talked about, so I apologize, but last week my question was, or the thought that I had was, which is probably what you just went over, but how they would be combined and what that would mean in terms of like demographic representation, but probably what you...

412
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:27,873
[SPEAKER_09]: They would have to be that the question of how they would be combined is still up there, but they would have to be contiguous and they would have to be equal, roughly equal in population.

413
00:36:27,933 --> 00:36:29,075
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all we know for sure.

414
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:37,688
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess my only concern about that would be like other demographic considerations.

415
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:37,888
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

416
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:39,889
[SPEAKER_05]: We just spent a lot of time talking about that.

417
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:45,612
[SPEAKER_05]: And the answer is, I think, by Massachusetts law, those things do have to be taken into account.

418
00:36:46,312 --> 00:36:50,675
[SPEAKER_05]: It, I think, is going to remain a question mark on this going forward.

419
00:36:51,895 --> 00:37:00,200
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Danielle, we talked about perhaps other people that were in better positions to make these determinations could be consulted for on that too.

420
00:37:01,088 --> 00:37:02,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, thank you.

421
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:04,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

422
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:08,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so the next is the mayor's role on the school committee.

423
00:37:08,751 --> 00:37:14,493
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody have any comments about that section of the document?

424
00:37:16,433 --> 00:37:33,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, like I was saying earlier, it seems like pretty universally, according to our survey, according to the city councilors I've talked to, I think even, I don't know if I've had a chat with the mayor, but I seem to remember somebody saying the mayor doesn't really want to be on the school committee.

425
00:37:33,263 --> 00:37:35,605
[SPEAKER_05]: So don't let me make things up.

426
00:37:35,665 --> 00:37:36,065
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

427
00:37:42,587 --> 00:37:45,272
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, it seems like the mayor has enough work as the mayor.

428
00:37:45,572 --> 00:37:51,943
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition, like just for me personally, I don't think the mayor should be on the school committee beyond the

429
00:37:54,152 --> 00:37:59,556
[SPEAKER_05]: My understanding is there's some rule where like the mayor is in some way on all of the city's committees.

430
00:37:59,916 --> 00:38:05,040
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't quite understand exactly what the legalities are of that, but I don't think the mayor should be on the school committee.

431
00:38:05,221 --> 00:38:08,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly don't think the mayor should be the chair of the school committee.

432
00:38:08,683 --> 00:38:15,048
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the mayor has enough work as mayor, and I don't think we need to give them a second job.

433
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, thank you, Gene.

434
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:32,987
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about this, but I still don't completely understand the reasoning behind having the mayor continue to be the chair in the proposal.

435
00:38:33,007 --> 00:38:41,053
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the thought was that you want the mayor engaged in the school, which I agree, and I think the mayor should be on the school committee.

436
00:38:41,873 --> 00:38:46,417
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just not convinced the mayor needs to be the chair, and I question whether

437
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:51,998
[SPEAKER_01]: if the mayor's on the school committee, why the mayor wouldn't be engaged?

438
00:38:52,058 --> 00:38:54,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they would have to attend the meetings.

439
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,184
[SPEAKER_01]: And so do we know that if the mayor's not in charge, the mayor won't be engaged?

440
00:39:01,204 --> 00:39:07,147
[SPEAKER_01]: That seems like a negative assumption about the mayor's engagement in the school system.

441
00:39:07,368 --> 00:39:09,449
[SPEAKER_01]: So that part I don't completely understand.

442
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:17,772
[SPEAKER_01]: I still don't completely understand why the mayor needs to be the chair and the committee's thinking that worked this out.

443
00:39:17,973 --> 00:39:21,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to hear more from the committee and your thinking on that.

444
00:39:21,514 --> 00:39:25,256
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll let Aminous take it away.

445
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:35,712
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that, first of all, I'm going to do a little history lesson back to 1982, Proposition two and a half.

446
00:39:37,314 --> 00:39:41,417
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that time, there was no mayor on the school committee.

447
00:39:42,198 --> 00:39:43,799
[SPEAKER_08]: and there was a city manager.

448
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:55,344
[SPEAKER_08]: And for those of you who are old enough, Proposition 2.5 devastated the school systems, and Medford was hit extremely hard with a huge amount of layoffs.

449
00:39:55,845 --> 00:40:01,808
[SPEAKER_08]: And part of the problem was that the manager at the time had no connection to

450
00:40:02,928 --> 00:40:06,470
[SPEAKER_08]: The schools did not attend meetings, wasn't connected.

451
00:40:07,111 --> 00:40:14,275
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when you're faced with layoffs, boy, it's a lot easier to lay off people and who you don't know and who you're not in front of.

452
00:40:15,075 --> 00:40:25,641
[SPEAKER_08]: And it took not years, but decades to overcome and make up for the difficulty with Proposition two and a half.

453
00:40:25,721 --> 00:40:28,023
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's just a historical piece.

454
00:40:28,963 --> 00:40:34,707
[SPEAKER_08]: which really underscored the reason why the mayor should be a central figure.

455
00:40:35,728 --> 00:40:37,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I did interview all three mayors.

456
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:44,253
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, the understandably, I know all of them.

457
00:40:44,373 --> 00:40:46,894
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we could do a lot of chit chat.

458
00:40:47,615 --> 00:40:49,896
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't necessarily want to be quoted word for word.

459
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:53,559
[SPEAKER_08]: All three of them said they saw it at first.

460
00:40:54,679 --> 00:41:02,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Admittedly, being on the school committee, but they all three told me that it was the most important role.

461
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:09,108
[SPEAKER_08]: It was an extremely important role for them, and they were so glad that they were part of it because they really understood the issues.

462
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:14,152
[SPEAKER_08]: And remember that the school budget is the largest proportion of the city budget.

463
00:41:14,912 --> 00:41:25,548
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, again, it's very difficult because I don't want, there's no quotes here, but you know, when you're the head of something and you're there and you're the chair of the meeting, you show up.

464
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:33,012
[SPEAKER_08]: Would it be easier, would it be easier not to show up if you weren't the head?

465
00:41:33,192 --> 00:41:39,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, so I'll leave that to your just thinking about, but that's one of the places where we went.

466
00:41:40,134 --> 00:41:52,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, the other piece of the discussion is some practical levels of when the mayor is, everybody thinks it's so much more work for the mayor and it is a meeting.

467
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:57,918
[SPEAKER_08]: On the other hand, as a citizen, if I want to see my mayor in public,

468
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:04,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that twice a month, I can go turn on the TV and watch my mayor in public.

469
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:08,512
[SPEAKER_08]: And frankly, the rest of the time, when do you see the mayor?

470
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:10,755
[SPEAKER_08]: When do you see the mayor working?

471
00:42:12,054 --> 00:42:16,960
[SPEAKER_08]: So just that is an opportunity for every citizen to get to see the mayor.

472
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,801
[SPEAKER_08]: Who's the mayor?

473
00:42:17,961 --> 00:42:20,203
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, turn on the TV on Monday night.

474
00:42:20,304 --> 00:42:25,590
[SPEAKER_08]: There's the mayor and this is how she or she or they are running the city.

475
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Just whatever.

476
00:42:27,913 --> 00:42:30,516
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, the bottom line was the budgets and access.

477
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:41,821
[SPEAKER_08]: When the mayor was at the meeting and running the meeting, and again, the superintendent puts together the agenda.

478
00:42:42,761 --> 00:42:47,403
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the mayor isn't doing that work.

479
00:42:47,463 --> 00:42:49,945
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the work of the superintendent and the staff.

480
00:42:50,685 --> 00:42:58,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Certainly, the mayor would oversee it, would take a look at it saying, hey, what's on the agenda today or tonight and what's coming up?

481
00:42:58,568 --> 00:43:03,970
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not that that adds a nuts and bolts task for the mayor.

482
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:08,792
[SPEAKER_08]: So yes, the mayor has to attend the two weekly meetings, I mean, monthly meetings.

483
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:16,215
[SPEAKER_08]: And if the mayor cannot attend, which happens sometimes, the vice chair steps into the place.

484
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:26,643
[SPEAKER_08]: None of the three mayors who I spoke to found that onerous or difficult, and they thought it gave them incredible access.

485
00:43:27,303 --> 00:43:33,368
[SPEAKER_08]: As a member of the school committee, it was the opportunity for the mayor to hear with

486
00:43:34,429 --> 00:43:45,891
[SPEAKER_08]: his or her ears what the issues were, and to also hear what the various different, the six other school committee members were bringing forth in our discussion.

487
00:43:46,171 --> 00:43:47,812
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's incredibly valuable.

488
00:43:48,152 --> 00:43:52,633
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's clearly why I feel so strongly about the mayor being in that role.

489
00:43:55,433 --> 00:43:56,434
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

490
00:43:56,574 --> 00:43:56,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Eunice.

491
00:43:59,479 --> 00:44:07,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Like many of you, I thought as well that the mayor should not be, at least not the chair of the school committee.

492
00:44:07,864 --> 00:44:25,855
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was my stance until we heard from the three mayors, our current mayor and the past two mayors, who, as Paulette stated, she so kindly went out and spoke with at length.

493
00:44:26,776 --> 00:44:28,637
[SPEAKER_04]: And each of them

494
00:44:30,773 --> 00:44:43,918
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty strongly felt that they enjoyed being on the school committee and they felt it was valuable for them and they wanted to be there and that's what.

495
00:44:45,014 --> 00:44:49,016
[SPEAKER_04]: finally swayed me to the fact that it was a good idea.

496
00:44:49,036 --> 00:45:06,823
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I believe that the, um, notes, um, uh, from all of the meetings that our school committee group had, um, and I'll attribute, I think most of those to, if not all to Paulette's great work, um, are in our drive.

497
00:45:06,843 --> 00:45:10,304
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can go back and see what they had to say.

498
00:45:11,725 --> 00:45:13,967
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's what swayed me.

499
00:45:15,668 --> 00:45:32,903
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I will ask, and it might be a running theme of mine as we run through all of these different articles, is are we responding to the community in the surveys that we received and so forth?

500
00:45:34,764 --> 00:45:36,726
[SPEAKER_04]: What is it that the community wanted?

501
00:45:37,632 --> 00:45:47,838
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know we've done our due diligence on every imaginable topic and every possible article, and we've all done great work.

502
00:45:48,518 --> 00:45:53,681
[SPEAKER_04]: But what is it that the community wants, and are we responding to them?

503
00:45:55,502 --> 00:46:03,767
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be one question that I may bring up consistently is, are we giving the community what they want?

504
00:46:03,787 --> 00:46:06,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

505
00:46:07,176 --> 00:46:09,798
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely was, my opinion was definitely swayed.

506
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:12,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Phyllis.

507
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:29,632
[SPEAKER_07]: I always thought that the mayor should be part of the school committee, but I had great objection to the mayor being the chair of the school committee because I didn't think that the mayor, you know, necessarily had an educational background.

508
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:32,911
[SPEAKER_07]: that would make him or her the perfect person to do this.

509
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:43,494
[SPEAKER_07]: When I found out that it was the superintendent who was setting the agenda and addressing, bring forth the needs that need to be addressed, then that made much more sense to me.

510
00:46:43,894 --> 00:46:53,457
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is why, you know, I have come around to saying that, yeah, I think that the mayor probably is best suited as not only, definitely as a member,

511
00:46:54,051 --> 00:46:54,671
[SPEAKER_07]: of the committee.

512
00:46:55,031 --> 00:47:05,315
[SPEAKER_07]: But my strong and adamant opposition to it has been changed to I agree that the person that's mayor should be the chair of that committee based on lots of things.

513
00:47:05,395 --> 00:47:18,219
[SPEAKER_07]: But for me, the most important was that the educational person was the one setting the agenda of bringing forth the agenda and bringing forth the matters that had to be attended to in the priority priority that they needed to be attended to.

514
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:18,279
[SPEAKER_07]: So

515
00:47:20,873 --> 00:47:21,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Phyllis.

516
00:47:22,154 --> 00:47:24,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Aubrey, did you want to share as well?

517
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,137
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a small comment.

518
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:37,886
[SPEAKER_10]: I think something about being the chair, the way that the meetings work, and Paula helped me here, is that deliberations happen and the chair would go last.

519
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:46,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that is, in terms of the voting, the mayor traditionally votes last.

520
00:47:46,132 --> 00:47:48,674
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't know where that comes from, but that's the way it's always been.

521
00:47:50,428 --> 00:47:51,950
[SPEAKER_08]: It's alphabetical roll call.

522
00:47:57,195 --> 00:47:59,597
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, David, you have another comment?

523
00:48:00,138 --> 00:48:00,518
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

524
00:48:05,403 --> 00:48:06,424
[SPEAKER_07]: I think you're muted, David.

525
00:48:06,444 --> 00:48:07,105
[SPEAKER_07]: You're muted.

526
00:48:07,545 --> 00:48:08,446
[SPEAKER_07]: You're muted, David.

527
00:48:09,658 --> 00:48:12,259
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I just wanted to share the survey.

528
00:48:12,399 --> 00:48:14,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody brought up that they wanted to see the results.

529
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:23,825
[SPEAKER_05]: We got 56% of people surveyed said that they felt that the mayor should not be the chairperson of the school committee.

530
00:48:25,825 --> 00:48:26,526
[SPEAKER_05]: With a further

531
00:48:28,456 --> 00:48:32,097
[SPEAKER_05]: like 23% saying that they weren't sure or had no opinion.

532
00:48:32,597 --> 00:48:41,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if we remove those people, it's like very nearly three to one against the mayor being chairperson.

533
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,301
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't just remove those people.

534
00:48:43,361 --> 00:48:44,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you can't.

535
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:45,461
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.

536
00:48:48,622 --> 00:48:52,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Either way, I don't know that we need to go with public opinion, but public opinion is certainly clear here.

537
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:55,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I say something?

538
00:48:56,325 --> 00:48:56,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

539
00:48:57,393 --> 00:48:57,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

540
00:48:58,294 --> 00:49:00,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I thought I might have been muted.

541
00:49:00,195 --> 00:49:02,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of just testing myself.

542
00:49:04,537 --> 00:49:08,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as far as the survey goes, we asked that specific question.

543
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,662
[SPEAKER_03]: If you ask different questions about the mayor and the school committee, you may have gotten different answers.

544
00:49:15,183 --> 00:49:24,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you could also say that that could be just people who may have

545
00:49:25,728 --> 00:49:54,427
[SPEAKER_03]: a general kind of maybe this is satisfaction but would want more uh a better school committee and and if you give them an option of of any change they might be for it i'm just saying it it was kind of a question that uh made it may have been better asked in a series of different questions uh than just you know uh should the mayor be on the school committee because i never really gave it a lot of thought and i i don't but uh

546
00:49:55,083 --> 00:50:16,309
[SPEAKER_03]: when, sorry about that, but I just want to say that it's an opportunity for the citizens, for the people, the parents of the kids who may come and speak at a city council meeting to be in front of the mayor and to voice their concerns and have the mayor front and center.

547
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:23,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Our kids are the most important thing we have in this city and the mayor needs to be

548
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:27,112
[SPEAKER_03]: involved and should be, like, right in the middle.

549
00:50:27,672 --> 00:50:42,857
[SPEAKER_03]: And when there are problems, she needs to be there and to hear them and to have to, you know, kind of be accountable to the parents and to the teachers and to everybody.

550
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:52,468
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine if you're going to have the mayor, you might as well have her be the chair.

551
00:50:52,508 --> 00:51:04,775
[SPEAKER_03]: If she votes last, if the majority of the school committee have a feeling one way, they're going to overrule the mayor.

552
00:51:04,835 --> 00:51:06,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's fair.

553
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:30,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's ever been, other than to hear it from a couple of, actually from one school committee member that Maury and I interviewed, and there really wasn't a clear reason why he didn't want the mayor.

554
00:51:31,808 --> 00:51:35,611
[SPEAKER_03]: on the school committee as the chair.

555
00:51:35,831 --> 00:51:42,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I specifically asked, and the only answer I got was, you know, it's too much power.

556
00:51:43,116 --> 00:51:53,243
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't see the mayor being a chair as really having any more power than any other school committee member when it comes to voting, so.

557
00:51:54,331 --> 00:52:05,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I, um, I'd like to just make a motion that we, uh, that, uh, we, we move on and kind of keep it the way, uh, the way it is.

558
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:06,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

559
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,824
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe what I, I, there may have been someone else who had their hand up and was it Jane?

560
00:52:10,844 --> 00:52:10,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Um,

561
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:15,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't see everybody's box.

562
00:52:16,119 --> 00:52:17,160
[SPEAKER_01]: I did have my hand up.

563
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:34,734
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just wondering how this, sorry for all the questions, the school committee members, I thought they, I thought several of them were in favor of the keeping the mayor on the committee, but not as chair.

564
00:52:36,035 --> 00:52:38,257
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that those were the interviews that we had.

565
00:52:39,642 --> 00:52:43,063
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there any that wanted to keep the mayor as chair?

566
00:52:43,363 --> 00:52:45,124
[SPEAKER_01]: Any of the school committee that we interviewed?

567
00:52:47,465 --> 00:52:50,586
[SPEAKER_09]: Paulette, you did reach out to more school committee members.

568
00:52:50,726 --> 00:52:51,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Was it something?

569
00:52:51,706 --> 00:52:54,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it broke in different ways.

570
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:58,749
[SPEAKER_08]: There was committee members who wanted to keep the mayor on.

571
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:03,331
[SPEAKER_08]: I think almost all of the school committee members wanted the mayor on the school committee.

572
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:06,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair or not chair, I think that there was a division.

573
00:53:08,734 --> 00:53:23,936
[SPEAKER_08]: One of the things I just want to add is I think that a whole lot of this charter review, you know, besides the city council becoming by ward is, oh, we've got to lessen the power of the mayor.

574
00:53:25,016 --> 00:53:38,764
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that because the mayor is visible at the school committee members, that it's easy for people to leap to, okay, I take the mayor off as the chair and I've lessened the power of the mayor.

575
00:53:39,544 --> 00:53:48,990
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think what I've been trying to argue is the benefits from having the power, the mayor as on the school committee.

576
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:53,573
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm just concerned that

577
00:53:54,603 --> 00:54:00,348
[SPEAKER_08]: The way that it looks, because the mayor is there, makes it easy to focus on that role.

578
00:54:00,768 --> 00:54:03,270
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've just been trying to argue what the benefits were.

579
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:07,193
[SPEAKER_08]: There were tremendous benefits as a member, having the mayor there.

580
00:54:11,977 --> 00:54:12,938
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, thank you.

581
00:54:13,018 --> 00:54:19,163
[SPEAKER_09]: So Anthony made a motion.

582
00:54:20,284 --> 00:54:22,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to reiterate that, Anthony?

583
00:54:22,205 --> 00:54:23,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you restate it?

584
00:54:25,161 --> 00:54:47,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd just like to make a motion to kind of accept what the subcommittee's findings were and to proceed with finding out about the ward and district stuff and calling the school committee, I guess calling it a day.

585
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:52,204
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, okay, I mean, right now we're just on the mayor as chair questions.

586
00:54:52,304 --> 00:55:05,877
[SPEAKER_09]: So unless somebody has a proposal that they want to change what's in here, then we can move on to- That's what I guess my motion is to move on.

587
00:55:06,518 --> 00:55:10,441
[SPEAKER_09]: So does anybody have, does anybody, David?

588
00:55:11,726 --> 00:55:20,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'll go ahead and move to remove the mayor as chairperson and instead have the council or the board elect their own chair.

589
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:22,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

590
00:55:23,056 --> 00:55:25,598
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to vote on this particular section.

591
00:55:26,158 --> 00:55:33,644
[SPEAKER_09]: So the motion is to keep mayor on school committee, but not as chair.

592
00:55:33,924 --> 00:55:34,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that correct?

593
00:55:35,205 --> 00:55:35,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

594
00:55:37,407 --> 00:55:37,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

595
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:40,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Paula.

596
00:55:42,366 --> 00:55:49,151
[SPEAKER_08]: So really the question isn't, is not to have the mayor as chair.

597
00:55:49,692 --> 00:55:56,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, if you vote yes, then you are taking the mayor, making the mayor not be chair.

598
00:55:57,157 --> 00:55:59,159
[SPEAKER_09]: A yes vote is- I'm gonna vote no.

599
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:00,680
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna vote no.

600
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,861
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't been seconded yet.

601
00:56:05,263 --> 00:56:06,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

602
00:56:06,924 --> 00:56:07,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Somebody wanna second it?

603
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:09,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I second.

604
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:11,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Jean, okay.

605
00:56:11,213 --> 00:56:12,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Paulette votes no.

606
00:56:12,514 --> 00:56:12,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Aubrey?

607
00:56:14,875 --> 00:56:15,035
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

608
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:16,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Jean?

609
00:56:18,556 --> 00:56:22,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, if I could explain, I feel like the- No, you don't need to explain.

610
00:56:24,978 --> 00:56:28,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would just like to- Okay.

611
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:37,281
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel like people have asked us to have more balance of power and especially on this issue, so that's why I'm voting that way.

612
00:56:38,222 --> 00:56:38,562
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

613
00:56:39,182 --> 00:56:39,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Danielle?

614
00:56:41,486 --> 00:56:43,307
[SPEAKER_06]: So vote of no.

615
00:56:44,807 --> 00:56:47,588
[SPEAKER_09]: No means mayor stays as chair.

616
00:56:47,648 --> 00:56:50,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes means mayor stays on the committee, but not chair.

617
00:56:51,008 --> 00:56:53,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, wait, did I do that right?

618
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:55,049
[SPEAKER_08]: No, wait a minute.

619
00:56:55,209 --> 00:56:55,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

620
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,530
[SPEAKER_09]: Paulette, you voted to keep the mayor as chair.

621
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:02,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

622
00:57:02,331 --> 00:57:05,412
[SPEAKER_09]: And Danielle, you're voting to have the mayor not be chair.

623
00:57:05,972 --> 00:57:06,192
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

624
00:57:06,552 --> 00:57:07,012
[SPEAKER_09]: David.

625
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:11,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

626
00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:12,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Phyllis.

627
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:13,570
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

628
00:57:14,231 --> 00:57:14,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Eunice.

629
00:57:15,191 --> 00:57:15,491
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

630
00:57:16,191 --> 00:57:16,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Anthony.

631
00:57:17,292 --> 00:57:17,532
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

632
00:57:19,093 --> 00:57:20,333
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm also going to vote no.

633
00:57:21,414 --> 00:57:28,197
[SPEAKER_09]: So the language will stay as it is for that particular issue.

634
00:57:29,137 --> 00:57:29,317
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

635
00:57:29,377 --> 00:57:30,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Aubrey has her hand up.

636
00:57:30,998 --> 00:57:31,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Aubrey.

637
00:57:33,259 --> 00:57:34,179
[SPEAKER_10]: I can probably keep up with them.

638
00:57:36,995 --> 00:57:40,577
[SPEAKER_10]: What I saw in that survey is a lot of people who are unsure of how it works.

639
00:57:40,797 --> 00:57:44,018
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel like I could make an argument for this decision.

640
00:57:44,939 --> 00:57:45,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

641
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:47,820
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

642
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:48,420
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

643
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:56,564
[SPEAKER_09]: So the other chunk that I wanted to pull out, because these are sort of fundamental to this article, was the term of office.

644
00:57:58,045 --> 00:58:03,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, the way it's written, the term is a two-year term, which is no change, basically.

645
00:58:04,368 --> 00:58:04,648
[SPEAKER_09]: David?

646
00:58:05,918 --> 00:58:13,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we start on that, I saw, oh, I guess let's do term and then we can do 4-1-C, because I find that- Yeah, yeah, that's good.

647
00:58:14,262 --> 00:58:16,943
[SPEAKER_09]: So does anybody, Paula, go ahead.

648
00:58:17,103 --> 00:58:20,685
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so the term of office, we really wanted three years.

649
00:58:21,985 --> 00:58:23,446
[SPEAKER_08]: We would love three years.

650
00:58:23,606 --> 00:58:31,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody we talked to said three years, the mayors, the school committee members, everybody said that would be ideal.

651
00:58:31,429 --> 00:58:32,430
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't know how to do it.

652
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:33,791
[SPEAKER_08]: Four years.

653
00:58:34,672 --> 00:58:39,958
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem with four years is people went, it feels a little long.

654
00:58:40,298 --> 00:58:44,643
[SPEAKER_08]: There are advantages because you could stagger elections.

655
00:58:45,424 --> 00:58:46,245
[SPEAKER_08]: We went through that.

656
00:58:46,265 --> 00:58:52,852
[SPEAKER_08]: It would definitely have an upside, but people just

657
00:58:53,971 --> 00:58:55,813
[SPEAKER_08]: just didn't feel comfortable with the four years.

658
00:58:55,893 --> 00:59:03,159
[SPEAKER_08]: So we ended back with two years, which we don't think is ideal, but we think that it's practical, unfortunately.

659
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:09,385
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd actually like to submit a side paper on three years, so it's very difficult to work out.

660
00:59:12,668 --> 00:59:13,088
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

661
00:59:13,549 --> 00:59:20,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody have any comment on this or are there any proposals on the table to change this?

662
00:59:21,013 --> 00:59:24,118
[SPEAKER_09]: particular aspect, the term of office, Aubrey.

663
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:33,554
[SPEAKER_10]: To add to Paula, one of the things that helped me decide was hearing from people who said that a four year term might have discouraged them from running.

664
00:59:35,097 --> 00:59:35,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

665
00:59:38,961 --> 00:59:40,322
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, nobody.

666
00:59:40,402 --> 00:59:51,768
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things about the three-year term, I agree that it would be ideal, but if the city council is a two-year term, we have to look at two as having, you know, consistent elections.

667
00:59:51,888 --> 01:00:03,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, you can have, you know, basically be having an election every year, you know, if we didn't also do city council at three years.

668
01:00:04,895 --> 01:00:23,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think we would have also considered three years for the city council if three-year elections were practical and feasible, but they're not because of the way elections are run and because under Massachusetts law, municipal elections and state and federal elections have to be on different ballots.

669
01:00:24,164 --> 01:00:30,448
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they were at the same time, it would just present huge difficulties to the elections department.

670
01:00:33,282 --> 01:00:38,984
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't hear anybody looking to make, to change, to offer a proposal, so that's great.

671
01:00:39,064 --> 01:00:42,005
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's move on now to the rest of the text.

672
01:00:42,185 --> 01:00:44,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know, David, you had something you wanted to say.

673
01:00:45,627 --> 01:00:50,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I saw that Aubrey has made some edits replacing the word voter with resident.

674
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:52,489
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.

675
01:00:53,469 --> 01:01:00,972
[SPEAKER_05]: But it does open up the eligibility of the school committee to non-citizens, as I understand it.

676
01:01:02,216 --> 01:01:03,537
[SPEAKER_05]: that is what that change would do.

677
01:01:05,598 --> 01:01:06,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's see.

678
01:01:07,019 --> 01:01:07,960
[SPEAKER_05]: As I understand it.

679
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the reason we choose voter is that it makes it citizens over the age of 18.

680
01:01:14,825 --> 01:01:23,871
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as I can tell, and I could very easily be wrong about this, lawyers correct me, residents could be a 12 year old immigrant kid.

681
01:01:24,591 --> 01:01:28,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And I love that, but I don't think it's probably what you intended.

682
01:01:30,388 --> 01:01:32,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Paulette, did you want to speak?

683
01:01:32,909 --> 01:01:33,529
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not on this.

684
01:01:33,549 --> 01:01:34,129
[SPEAKER_08]: It's interesting.

685
01:01:35,049 --> 01:01:44,891
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't know if that would interact with any existing laws about running for office, but that is interesting.

686
01:01:45,611 --> 01:01:51,472
[SPEAKER_09]: In the other example charters that we looked at, did they say resident or voter?

687
01:01:51,532 --> 01:01:52,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we remember?

688
01:01:53,092 --> 01:01:56,913
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we chose voter for Section 2 and 3 as well.

689
01:01:57,433 --> 01:01:57,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

690
01:01:58,936 --> 01:02:06,080
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that's a section that should have some consistency across all of our bodies.

691
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:10,021
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either president or it's voter.

692
01:02:10,082 --> 01:02:10,882
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one or the other.

693
01:02:12,463 --> 01:02:13,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Aubrey, go ahead.

694
01:02:13,163 --> 01:02:15,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to propose the same thing, you know, just to have consistency.

695
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:21,167
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that this was me taking notes at our last meeting, not me coming up with this.

696
01:02:21,627 --> 01:02:21,927
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

697
01:02:22,107 --> 01:02:25,949
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can change it back to voter and people are OK with that?

698
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:26,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

699
01:02:29,158 --> 01:02:30,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other comments?

700
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody looked at what the Collins Center had written.

701
01:02:35,061 --> 01:02:40,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I preferred resident, but I don't think that that's probably very a popular opinion.

702
01:02:40,885 --> 01:02:41,925
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll leave it at that.

703
01:02:42,506 --> 01:02:42,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

704
01:02:44,907 --> 01:02:46,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Melva, can you make the text bigger?

705
01:02:47,769 --> 01:02:48,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

706
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:49,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

707
01:02:50,678 --> 01:02:52,359
[SPEAKER_04]: if we're going to follow along here.

708
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Paula, do you have your hand raised or did you not just lower it from the last time?

709
01:02:56,121 --> 01:02:57,422
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I just raised it.

710
01:02:57,862 --> 01:02:58,202
[SPEAKER_08]: Again.

711
01:02:58,342 --> 01:02:58,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

712
01:02:58,582 --> 01:02:59,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

713
01:02:59,303 --> 01:03:00,503
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead, Paula.

714
01:03:01,164 --> 01:03:07,087
[SPEAKER_08]: So, my comment is on the Collins Center note for 1C eligibility.

715
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:08,848
[SPEAKER_08]: We had put in,

716
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:27,195
[SPEAKER_08]: have resided in one of the wards they represent, in one of the wards prior to submitting nomination papers, or it really should be at the time of submitting nomination papers.

717
01:03:29,135 --> 01:03:33,497
[SPEAKER_08]: And they wrote when nomination papers are submitted can vary significantly.

718
01:03:35,741 --> 01:03:48,029
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing is that if you're going to represent a ward, and there may be, again, some place where we have to make sure that this jives with what they wrote for the city council.

719
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:53,013
[SPEAKER_08]: For the city council, do they say in the works?

720
01:03:53,073 --> 01:03:53,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't remember.

721
01:03:53,953 --> 01:03:55,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we had this.

722
01:03:56,495 --> 01:03:57,335
[SPEAKER_09]: David, do you remember?

723
01:03:57,356 --> 01:04:00,838
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we had this as a condition for eligibility.

724
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:04,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we didn't include this time condition.

725
01:04:04,499 --> 01:04:08,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have to say, the next thing I was going to bring up was that I think that this is not good.

726
01:04:09,703 --> 01:04:12,524
[SPEAKER_08]: So David, let me just ask you a question to explain this.

727
01:04:13,285 --> 01:04:23,532
[SPEAKER_08]: If we're putting all this energy into saying we want people to be from the wards, OK, that they're ward representatives, but then you don't

728
01:04:25,259 --> 01:04:33,661
[SPEAKER_08]: say any way of saying how long they live in the ward or when does that start or whatever, what's kind of the point?

729
01:04:33,681 --> 01:04:42,263
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, don't they have to, if they're going to represent the ward, shouldn't they be living in the ward and shouldn't there be some need to prove that?

730
01:04:43,563 --> 01:04:45,724
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I have no issue with having to live in the ward.

731
01:04:47,918 --> 01:04:52,481
[SPEAKER_05]: The one year prior seems a little, first of all, just messy.

732
01:04:53,242 --> 01:05:10,814
[SPEAKER_05]: Second of all, I think it kind of, one thing it seems to do is if you have lived in Medford from the day you were born and you decide to move to another ward, you can, maybe you've been on the school committee for 10 years and now you have to, you can't run.

733
01:05:12,174 --> 01:05:19,122
[SPEAKER_05]: unless you time your move to happen at the appropriate time relative to elections.

734
01:05:19,722 --> 01:05:34,198
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so how do you make sure, or at what point, you say to a candidate, you're being elected by the ward, you need to live in the ward?

735
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:39,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's completely reasonable to say when you submit the nomination papers, you have to be a resident of the ward.

736
01:05:40,071 --> 01:05:41,191
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's super reasonable.

737
01:05:41,392 --> 01:05:42,352
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that you're right.

738
01:05:42,732 --> 01:05:45,012
[SPEAKER_08]: So you just don't like the one year, but submitting.

739
01:05:45,673 --> 01:05:47,613
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't actually have any problem with that.

740
01:05:48,233 --> 01:05:54,675
[SPEAKER_08]: I just and by the way, I think for a candidate submitting the nomination papers, I don't care if it's on a different date every every time.

741
01:05:55,095 --> 01:05:55,275
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

742
01:05:55,835 --> 01:05:56,635
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very clear.

743
01:05:56,755 --> 01:05:58,476
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, the Collins Center question that.

744
01:05:58,896 --> 01:06:02,256
[SPEAKER_08]: And to me, it's a very clear for a candidate who's running.

745
01:06:02,316 --> 01:06:03,537
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very clear mark.

746
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:04,457
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're certainly

747
01:06:04,937 --> 01:06:07,098
[SPEAKER_08]: The nomination papers have your address on them?

748
01:06:07,919 --> 01:06:08,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

749
01:06:08,619 --> 01:06:11,541
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the address should be in the place you're running.

750
01:06:11,561 --> 01:06:15,544
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can't imagine why it would be anything else.

751
01:06:16,224 --> 01:06:21,368
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, one thing I would remove is just, yeah.

752
01:06:21,688 --> 01:06:23,909
[SPEAKER_09]: So David, I mean, David, sorry.

753
01:06:24,009 --> 01:06:29,353
[SPEAKER_09]: You're proposing that we remove for one year prior.

754
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:30,634
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

755
01:06:31,134 --> 01:06:32,475
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish there was a...

756
01:06:34,221 --> 01:06:37,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess, make it present tense, right?

757
01:06:37,386 --> 01:06:41,812
[SPEAKER_05]: They shall reside in the ward they wish to represent when submitting nomination papers.

758
01:06:42,633 --> 01:06:50,064
[SPEAKER_08]: And yeah, at the time that they submit nomination papers for that office.

759
01:06:54,813 --> 01:06:58,015
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that at the time is probably not necessary.

760
01:06:58,395 --> 01:07:12,462
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, but the intent and the meaning is the same, so I don't really care when when they present when they you turn in your nomination papers when you when you submit.

761
01:07:13,422 --> 01:07:15,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Your nomination papers.

762
01:07:16,124 --> 01:07:18,805
[SPEAKER_08]: To the to the city to the city clerk is really.

763
01:07:21,684 --> 01:07:25,228
[SPEAKER_09]: What if we just say shall reside in the ward they wish to represent?

764
01:07:26,370 --> 01:07:27,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have to put the other part in?

765
01:07:28,292 --> 01:07:29,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, as determined.

766
01:07:31,636 --> 01:07:34,219
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you have to say something.

767
01:07:38,514 --> 01:07:43,578
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we possibly put that it be their primary residence?

768
01:07:43,678 --> 01:07:52,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Because just to think, if people know that there's an open ward or open district, then you can just say, well, I'll

769
01:07:54,485 --> 01:08:01,607
[SPEAKER_03]: be a resident of that water district for the day I, you know, get my nomination papers in.

770
01:08:01,667 --> 01:08:18,371
[SPEAKER_03]: And if that's the only requirement, they shall, I think it should say something about shall be a, hold the primary residence in the ward that they choose to run for or something to that effect.

771
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:22,705
[SPEAKER_09]: I, to me, shall reside in the ward they wish to represent.

772
01:08:22,725 --> 01:08:23,987
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what that says.

773
01:08:26,031 --> 01:08:28,254
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we could end it there, personally.

774
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:28,354
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

775
01:08:35,408 --> 01:08:39,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we just do what we did for the city council, have the same language?

776
01:08:41,271 --> 01:08:42,452
[SPEAKER_01]: Have them mirror each other?

777
01:08:43,593 --> 01:08:46,574
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and we'd have to go back and check that.

778
01:08:47,735 --> 01:08:57,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so the way we did this for the city council is we said that a ward councillor shall be a voter in the ward from which election is sought.

779
01:08:59,550 --> 01:09:02,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's actually even more streamlined.

780
01:09:03,373 --> 01:09:07,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you can't be a voter there if you don't live there, right?

781
01:09:08,496 --> 01:09:08,976
[SPEAKER_09]: That's good.

782
01:09:09,377 --> 01:09:12,719
[SPEAKER_09]: So Aubrey, you're still making notes.

783
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:15,621
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you just make a note to mirror city council language?

784
01:09:15,761 --> 01:09:18,323
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you can fix that later.

785
01:09:18,783 --> 01:09:20,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask a silly question?

786
01:09:21,265 --> 01:09:23,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have to be a voter to run for office?

787
01:09:27,021 --> 01:09:29,802
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's what we just discussed.

788
01:09:34,304 --> 01:09:42,228
[SPEAKER_05]: I suggested that it would be lovely to not make that a requirement for the school board, but I'm not going to really suggest that.

789
01:09:42,808 --> 01:09:47,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Does voter mean like that you have to be registered to vote?

790
01:09:47,090 --> 01:09:48,391
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be registered to vote.

791
01:09:48,431 --> 01:09:51,312
[SPEAKER_01]: You're registered to vote doesn't mean you have a history of voting.

792
01:09:51,552 --> 01:09:55,114
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a requirement to run for office.

793
01:09:56,371 --> 01:09:57,031
[SPEAKER_06]: That's interesting.

794
01:09:57,132 --> 01:09:59,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is according to the general law.

795
01:09:59,974 --> 01:10:01,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it part of the general law?

796
01:10:03,476 --> 01:10:04,757
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's what we need to check.

797
01:10:04,957 --> 01:10:14,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Because otherwise, I mean, I know a lovely, lovely person who I wish could have multiple people over the years who I would have loved to have served with on the school committee.

798
01:10:15,906 --> 01:10:19,588
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it's a requirement under, I mean, people would say to me, I'm not a citizen.

799
01:10:20,109 --> 01:10:20,349
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

800
01:10:22,170 --> 01:10:24,192
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can be a citizen and not a registered voter.

801
01:10:24,992 --> 01:10:25,453
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

802
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:38,939
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the thing the registered voter bit does is it provides a all-in-one check that you are a citizen, a resident in the right place of voting age.

803
01:10:39,319 --> 01:10:46,181
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, like, it's a way of offloading all of that checking that we might want to do onto a different system.

804
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:57,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so do we need any more discussion on this eligibility section?

805
01:10:57,401 --> 01:11:01,487
[SPEAKER_09]: We've discussed having this mirror the language that's in the city council section.

806
01:11:04,457 --> 01:11:19,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll say that having heard Paulette say that she might be interested in opening this up to folks who are not citizens, I would love to ask the Collins Center, hey, can we have non-citizens on the school committee?

807
01:11:20,048 --> 01:11:27,414
[SPEAKER_05]: And if so, I would love to revisit this and maybe open it up if that's something that enough people would vote for.

808
01:11:30,580 --> 01:11:35,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be interested in that, but it would be weird that they can be elected, but they can't vote in local elections.

809
01:11:35,704 --> 01:11:36,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's true.

810
01:11:36,484 --> 01:11:44,109
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we would need to allow them to have voting privileges in local elections, which I would be in favor of.

811
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:48,913
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we just leave it that we'll leave it as it is right now, but we'll check it.

812
01:11:49,133 --> 01:11:53,956
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's different, if people don't need to be citizens, we'll bring it back up?

813
01:11:55,037 --> 01:11:56,318
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds like a plan.

814
01:11:56,338 --> 01:11:56,378
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

815
01:11:59,804 --> 01:12:06,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, any other, there were a couple of other comments, I think that the Collins Center had.

816
01:12:06,668 --> 01:12:16,214
[SPEAKER_08]: So I can address, there's another one question and I'm sorry, my picture, I think it was in four two about the chair, vice chair and secretary.

817
01:12:16,694 --> 01:12:21,637
[SPEAKER_08]: And the Collins Center said, it is unusual to delegate to one individual.

818
01:12:21,697 --> 01:12:23,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Is this the current practice in Medford?

819
01:12:23,418 --> 01:12:25,620
[SPEAKER_08]: It is the current practice in Medford.

820
01:12:28,931 --> 01:12:31,713
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, they could opt to change it.

821
01:12:32,033 --> 01:12:43,342
[SPEAKER_08]: Some school committees that I'm knowledgeable of, they have a subcommittee and the bills are brought to the subcommittee and they do it like that, but that is not the way Medford has traditionally done it.

822
01:12:44,503 --> 01:12:50,848
[SPEAKER_08]: And it is by when you're elected as secretary, that is your job.

823
01:12:51,849 --> 01:12:53,410
[SPEAKER_08]: And by the way,

824
01:12:56,142 --> 01:13:01,563
[SPEAKER_08]: The superintendent also, the superintendent and the department head also signs off on the bills.

825
01:13:02,304 --> 01:13:04,304
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's not just the school committee member.

826
01:13:05,744 --> 01:13:07,485
[SPEAKER_08]: There are three sign-offs.

827
01:13:09,345 --> 01:13:22,448
[SPEAKER_09]: So my take on that was that maybe it doesn't need to be in the charter, because once it's in the charter, I think, Paulette, you just said, well, somebody can vote to change it, but they can't if it's in the charter.

828
01:13:23,753 --> 01:13:26,515
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe it's one of those things that doesn't need to be in the charter.

829
01:13:27,195 --> 01:13:33,299
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just a way, it's one of the things that the school committee can decide when they decide their own operating rules.

830
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:40,563
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, what I wrote is unless the school committee votes to form a subcommittee, especially for reviewing the bills.

831
01:13:41,123 --> 01:13:45,125
[SPEAKER_08]: So I left it as an option or as a potential.

832
01:13:45,686 --> 01:13:48,927
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, you know, one of the things is that

833
01:13:51,480 --> 01:14:02,371
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, if I had had a document like this and went to the city charter when I was running for school committee and saw what I was, how it worked, it would have been great.

834
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:07,917
[SPEAKER_08]: And so for me, including that detail is helpful.

835
01:14:09,419 --> 01:14:12,082
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I don't I'm open to the will of the.

836
01:14:13,683 --> 01:14:23,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you think that if the school committee had a document that sort of outlined their rules and how they operate, that could have been equally as helpful?

837
01:14:24,907 --> 01:14:25,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, they do now.

838
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:27,088
[SPEAKER_08]: When I ran, they didn't.

839
01:14:27,108 --> 01:14:27,888
[SPEAKER_08]: They did.

840
01:14:28,088 --> 01:14:28,628
[SPEAKER_08]: So they do.

841
01:14:29,429 --> 01:14:37,331
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, let's say you're not knowledgeable about the city or the school committee in particular.

842
01:14:37,351 --> 01:14:39,032
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, a lot of people have no clue.

843
01:14:39,812 --> 01:14:45,196
[SPEAKER_08]: what the school committee does, but yet they've been interested in this charter review and whatever.

844
01:14:45,216 --> 01:14:47,697
[SPEAKER_08]: And now all of a sudden they're sort of saying, oh, I didn't know.

845
01:14:47,837 --> 01:14:51,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't know that the secretary had that role.

846
01:14:53,741 --> 01:15:02,266
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, so for me, it's educational as well as anything else.

847
01:15:02,326 --> 01:15:04,848
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, I think it's informative.

848
01:15:06,729 --> 01:15:08,430
[SPEAKER_09]: What do people think about this?

849
01:15:10,676 --> 01:15:19,058
[SPEAKER_09]: this particular, I guess it's really just the last sentence there that's now in purple.

850
01:15:19,138 --> 01:15:19,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Aubrey.

851
01:15:20,519 --> 01:15:25,440
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the sentence before that says the secretary is responsible to record the votes.

852
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:26,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

853
01:15:27,201 --> 01:15:33,922
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, you know, we talk about that we're gonna have a vice chair, and we're gonna have a secretary, what the hell does the secretary do?

854
01:15:36,143 --> 01:15:37,623
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, why wouldn't you include it?

855
01:15:37,744 --> 01:15:39,204
[SPEAKER_08]: Why wouldn't you include their duties?

856
01:15:42,003 --> 01:15:53,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the charter is not something that can be changed or modified, and it's the kind of situation where they might want to change or modify some of those responsibilities, I think.

857
01:15:53,930 --> 01:16:08,358
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the other thing was that the Collins Center had the question from this language maybe whether the secretary was approving the expenditure or approving that the bill be paid.

858
01:16:09,647 --> 01:16:16,508
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that's that's a distinction that I'm not quite sure exactly where they're cutting it.

859
01:16:18,869 --> 01:16:19,089
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

860
01:16:19,109 --> 01:16:23,470
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say that the bill be paid, but right.

861
01:16:24,050 --> 01:16:25,030
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

862
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:31,911
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, it's not solely there isn't there are other sign offs.

863
01:16:32,731 --> 01:16:35,552
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean,

864
01:16:36,571 --> 01:16:53,984
[SPEAKER_09]: So just the fact that there's other sign-offs to me means that this can't go in like this because it implies that the secretary has that responsibility exclusively, I think, but... Okay, well, except that you could add a clause saying, along with the designated members of the school department.

865
01:16:54,664 --> 01:16:54,904
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

866
01:16:55,345 --> 01:16:55,805
[SPEAKER_09]: We could.

867
01:16:56,586 --> 01:16:56,886
[SPEAKER_08]: You know.

868
01:16:57,206 --> 01:17:00,809
[SPEAKER_09]: But then are we getting more complicated than we need to be in the charter?

869
01:17:01,169 --> 01:17:01,569
[SPEAKER_09]: Did somebody...

870
01:17:03,123 --> 01:17:11,566
[SPEAKER_08]: But, but then, you know, again I'm going to sort of argue this as we go because the Collins next ones they said oh this is more specific language than we normally see.

871
01:17:12,295 --> 01:17:21,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay, I read all of those other, the other ones that were submitted by other, that are in other districts, and we can copy theirs.

872
01:17:22,683 --> 01:17:25,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fine with copying, you know, rubber stamping theirs.

873
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:27,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford, it's the same as Melrose.

874
01:17:27,806 --> 01:17:28,687
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same as whatever.

875
01:17:28,707 --> 01:17:32,329
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a rubber stamp with, you know, this clause or that clause written differently.

876
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:37,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Or do we want a charter which sort of outlines, hey, this is what we're saying.

877
01:17:37,113 --> 01:17:39,535
[SPEAKER_08]: This is what our government is.

878
01:17:41,708 --> 01:17:45,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Milva, I had to switch to my phone, so I can't find my reactions on here.

879
01:17:45,749 --> 01:17:47,350
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't find anything on this phone.

880
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:48,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

881
01:17:48,890 --> 01:17:55,593
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'd like to say my concern is what Milva just brought up though, Paulette.

882
01:17:56,173 --> 01:17:59,374
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's in the charter, can it then be changed?

883
01:17:59,914 --> 01:18:01,855
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is one caution for me.

884
01:18:02,515 --> 01:18:04,997
[SPEAKER_07]: That's like a big yellow flag to me.

885
01:18:05,518 --> 01:18:07,079
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be my concern.

886
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:11,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that, you know, giving people more information about things is a wonderful thing.

887
01:18:11,744 --> 01:18:14,206
[SPEAKER_07]: They have a little bit of sense of how things operate.

888
01:18:14,507 --> 01:18:14,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

889
01:18:15,668 --> 01:18:17,610
[SPEAKER_07]: It might eliminate some questions for them too.

890
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:19,692
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it's in the charter,

891
01:18:20,889 --> 01:18:32,277
[SPEAKER_07]: Does it tie the hands of the people who may think that changes would make things run more efficiently or they may have to switch to different services or different things like that?

892
01:18:32,618 --> 01:18:35,160
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my concern with keeping that in there.

893
01:18:35,180 --> 01:18:40,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So I guess then the question would be, what are the provisions for changing the charter?

894
01:18:41,524 --> 01:18:42,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

895
01:18:43,775 --> 01:18:44,936
[SPEAKER_09]: what we're doing right now.

896
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:52,345
[SPEAKER_09]: There's other ways as well, but there's no simple way to change the charter.

897
01:18:52,925 --> 01:18:57,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Except that it's supposed to be reviewed every 10 years and it hadn't been reviewed for 50.

898
01:18:58,655 --> 01:19:11,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, when we eventually get to that section of the charter, yeah, we'll determine what period of time we want to put in, but that still leaves a long period of time.

899
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:15,662
[SPEAKER_09]: And just because it's reviewed every 10 years, that's not the same as changing it.

900
01:19:16,302 --> 01:19:16,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

901
01:19:17,222 --> 01:19:30,406
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, so we have a secretary and that the other members voted and nobody else is bothered by the fact that it doesn't say anything about the duties of the secretary.

902
01:19:30,426 --> 01:19:32,327
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm not bothered by that.

903
01:19:34,994 --> 01:19:35,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with you.

904
01:19:35,655 --> 01:19:57,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if somebody has no duties you might as well remove them and and then let the the board or Sorry school committee Create the role for themselves if they so desire by their own rules I have a related question

905
01:19:59,128 --> 01:20:10,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is, so like, as it currently works, when you say that the secretary or clerk is reviewing these bills, what happens if they say no?

906
01:20:11,442 --> 01:20:18,550
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they say no, so you pull the bill, you say, I have questions about this one.

907
01:20:20,384 --> 01:20:28,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Talk to people to see whether you can get the questions answered, so you feel comfortable signing it.

908
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:34,435
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you don't, then it doesn't get paid, and there's a larger discussion.

909
01:20:35,135 --> 01:20:45,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Also, at the school committee meetings, when the bills and payrolls are approved, there's also an opportunity for all school committee members to ask questions about the bills.

910
01:20:46,205 --> 01:21:02,719
[SPEAKER_08]: At that point, the secretary has a role where they're saying, and along with the superintendent, but the secretary, because they've reviewed them, may remember that the $700 that was spent for pizza was because it was the senior night at whatever, and that's why there's

911
01:21:03,239 --> 01:21:07,383
[SPEAKER_08]: there was so much money spent on pizza or slush or shoelaces.

912
01:21:07,823 --> 01:21:19,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, when you're seeing the bills, you are seeing every single bill, whether it's for shoelaces or slush or textbooks or whatever.

913
01:21:22,557 --> 01:21:25,140
[SPEAKER_08]: So you certainly are asked questions.

914
01:21:28,987 --> 01:21:39,351
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll say having heard that, I think it's completely reasonable for the charter to require some member of the committee or the committee as a whole to be reviewing all of those bills.

915
01:21:39,611 --> 01:21:41,072
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't find that unreasonable at all.

916
01:21:44,473 --> 01:21:48,715
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my two cents.

917
01:21:48,735 --> 01:21:51,816
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, let's see who else has their hand up.

918
01:21:52,617 --> 01:21:53,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I do.

919
01:21:53,677 --> 01:21:53,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Aubrey.

920
01:21:57,023 --> 01:22:10,575
[SPEAKER_10]: I was fine with including this, but I'm also feeling fine with removing this because the secretary will still have a sentence, the responsibility to record votes, which is, I think, an important role that we want.

921
01:22:10,615 --> 01:22:19,343
[SPEAKER_10]: We're saying we want somebody to be recording the votes and to have a public availability of what's happening at these meetings for recording purposes.

922
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:20,710
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a solution.

923
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:31,335
[SPEAKER_08]: What if we say that sentence and then say, as well as other duties prescribed by the rules and regulations of the school committee or whatever?

924
01:22:31,355 --> 01:22:31,956
[SPEAKER_08]: That's good.

925
01:22:33,676 --> 01:22:34,537
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's fine.

926
01:22:34,577 --> 01:22:38,439
[SPEAKER_10]: But we don't say everything the vice chair does.

927
01:22:38,599 --> 01:22:40,539
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't say everything the mayor does.

928
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,381
[SPEAKER_10]: And I don't think we need to say everything the secretary does.

929
01:22:43,641 --> 01:22:46,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Just the key piece that they do.

930
01:22:47,903 --> 01:22:47,963
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

931
01:22:49,628 --> 01:22:54,273
[SPEAKER_08]: I could argue back, Aubrey, that the key piece is the signing of the bills.

932
01:22:57,217 --> 01:22:59,199
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of the other people who sign it, right?

933
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:08,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, the superintendent does, but it's not going to get paid until the school committee member gets to do it.

934
01:23:10,801 --> 01:23:31,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I suggest that we move this responsibility from being the secretary's responsibility to being the committee's responsibility and Is that which so I think So you're to be you're suggesting changing it from the second secretary to the committee is responsible for correct.

935
01:23:31,515 --> 01:23:31,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I

936
01:23:33,583 --> 01:23:35,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess we can look at that.

937
01:23:36,305 --> 01:23:38,667
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm inclined to simply remove that sentence.

938
01:23:39,448 --> 01:23:41,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it works easier to remove that sentence.

939
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:43,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

940
01:23:45,112 --> 01:23:48,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we want to vote on whether we want to remove it or are we?

941
01:23:48,993 --> 01:23:50,415
[SPEAKER_09]: No, just remove it.

942
01:23:50,555 --> 01:23:51,315
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're good.

943
01:23:51,436 --> 01:24:01,666
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're being consistent to, you know, if we're going to let the city council kind of make their own rules, the city school committee needs to make their own own rules as well.

944
01:24:01,746 --> 01:24:03,528
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just just.

945
01:24:06,225 --> 01:24:07,526
[SPEAKER_03]: The charter may not change.

946
01:24:07,786 --> 01:24:08,987
[SPEAKER_03]: This charter may not change.

947
01:24:09,027 --> 01:24:10,148
[SPEAKER_03]: The charter may not change.

948
01:24:10,548 --> 01:24:12,429
[SPEAKER_03]: It may not change for the next 30 years.

949
01:24:14,871 --> 01:24:17,432
[SPEAKER_03]: The school committee has to function.

950
01:24:17,753 --> 01:24:26,838
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't tie their hands by, oh, the secretary wasn't here to sign the bill, and then no slush for the kids.

951
01:24:28,577 --> 01:24:31,738
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the way, I never got any slush when I was in math for public school.

952
01:24:32,138 --> 01:24:42,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if the secretary, just Anthony, just so you know, if the secretary isn't available because they're on vacation that week, they ask someone else in the committee to do it.

953
01:24:42,660 --> 01:24:43,900
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's never not done.

954
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:45,300
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be done.

955
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:47,701
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's part of their procedures and rules and stuff.

956
01:24:47,721 --> 01:24:52,942
[SPEAKER_03]: So let them figure it out.

957
01:24:53,622 --> 01:24:57,003
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't feel strongly, but I think it should either be secretary or clerk.

958
01:24:58,873 --> 01:25:01,234
[SPEAKER_05]: As it is currently written, I think it's confusing.

959
01:25:01,895 --> 01:25:04,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just call it secretary or clerk.

960
01:25:04,957 --> 01:25:06,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that makes sense.

961
01:25:06,859 --> 01:25:11,282
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we should stick with secretary because clerk is what's used on the city council.

962
01:25:11,322 --> 01:25:13,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you're right.

963
01:25:14,204 --> 01:25:14,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

964
01:25:14,844 --> 01:25:16,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Aubrey, do you mind making those changes as well?

965
01:25:16,926 --> 01:25:21,669
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

966
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:24,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other sections of this?

967
01:25:24,652 --> 01:25:27,554
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I think that the other, let's see.

968
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:35,245
[SPEAKER_09]: The Collins Center also sort of had some questions about the powers and duties section.

969
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:35,705
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

970
01:25:36,405 --> 01:25:36,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

971
01:25:36,686 --> 01:25:39,948
[SPEAKER_08]: It says that the language in this section is far more comprehensive.

972
01:25:40,048 --> 01:25:41,489
[SPEAKER_08]: And I can go back again.

973
01:25:41,509 --> 01:25:51,336
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I need to, I needed some time for my brain to kind of leave what I'd written to look, try and look at it fresh and make it simpler.

974
01:25:51,356 --> 01:25:51,396
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

975
01:25:54,356 --> 01:26:00,563
[SPEAKER_08]: But to see, you know, how to not be so comprehensive, I thought being comprehensive was good.

976
01:26:02,525 --> 01:26:12,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, again, even my own members on the subcommittee, I think every one of them said, I had no idea the school committee members did that.

977
01:26:13,055 --> 01:26:21,979
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I was coming from it by that point of sort of saying, boy, you know, here's a chance in our charter to outline what the school committee does.

978
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,762
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I understand that people see it as a much more general document.

979
01:26:28,282 --> 01:26:34,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really agree, but it's not the first thing that I'll disagree on.

980
01:26:34,946 --> 01:26:36,446
[SPEAKER_08]: But I need some time to look at it.

981
01:26:36,767 --> 01:26:38,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't have a chance to simplify it.

982
01:26:38,607 --> 01:26:41,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to see where the committee was going before I spent any more time on it.

983
01:26:42,508 --> 01:26:46,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, any other thoughts about that aspect of this?

984
01:26:47,409 --> 01:26:57,111
[SPEAKER_10]: I highlighted a section that I think if we, this is the one we added from the other document.

985
01:26:57,811 --> 01:27:06,113
[SPEAKER_10]: If we get the purple highlights, I think if we removed that, the rest of it is pretty parallel to what I've seen in other places.

986
01:27:06,914 --> 01:27:07,174
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

987
01:27:11,211 --> 01:27:12,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Eunice, did you have your hand up also?

988
01:27:13,452 --> 01:27:14,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

989
01:27:14,632 --> 01:27:26,394
[SPEAKER_04]: If I remember correctly from one of our subcommittee meetings, Paulette, didn't you say that this is what is registered on the Medford page of the Mass Association of School Committees?

990
01:27:28,035 --> 01:27:28,555
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

991
01:27:28,755 --> 01:27:29,035
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

992
01:27:29,795 --> 01:27:33,476
[SPEAKER_08]: But to understand that the primary,

993
01:27:34,420 --> 01:27:42,602
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if I were to say what are the three main duties of the school committee, it's superintendent, it's to make policy, and it's to approve the budget.

994
01:27:42,882 --> 01:27:47,144
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are the three main.

995
01:27:47,304 --> 01:27:48,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Did we just lose Paula?

996
01:27:50,785 --> 01:27:53,806
[SPEAKER_08]: The public relations is kind of the added one.

997
01:27:57,227 --> 01:27:57,927
[SPEAKER_08]: But traditionally,

998
01:27:59,463 --> 01:28:02,865
[SPEAKER_08]: a former charter, it probably has those main duties.

999
01:28:04,486 --> 01:28:06,106
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is just more comprehensive.

1000
01:28:07,207 --> 01:28:07,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1001
01:28:08,087 --> 01:28:08,547
[SPEAKER_09]: David?

1002
01:28:13,630 --> 01:28:15,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, I think I just left my hand up there.

1003
01:28:15,391 --> 01:28:15,811
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you did?

1004
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:16,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1005
01:28:16,971 --> 01:28:26,036
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I mean, going back to the ideas about sort of what should, you know, putting

1006
01:28:28,005 --> 01:28:42,738
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything in the charter that can be, that is policy that maybe we want to leave open the option of changing that policy or anything like that, you probably shouldn't put in the charter, right?

1007
01:28:42,818 --> 01:28:44,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, okay.

1008
01:28:44,059 --> 01:28:46,841
[SPEAKER_08]: So with number two, appraisal, I think we can take that one out.

1009
01:28:47,301 --> 01:28:52,146
[SPEAKER_08]: With number one is responsible for the development of policy.

1010
01:28:56,003 --> 01:28:58,944
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's redundant with section A below that.

1011
01:28:59,925 --> 01:29:00,685
[SPEAKER_08]: With section?

1012
01:29:00,705 --> 01:29:09,269
[SPEAKER_09]: A. Oh, here we go.

1013
01:29:09,389 --> 01:29:09,529
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1014
01:29:12,710 --> 01:29:15,071
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so you want to take out 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5?

1015
01:29:26,928 --> 01:29:29,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, we can take out 1, 2, 3, and 4, and 5.

1016
01:29:29,849 --> 01:29:33,030
[SPEAKER_08]: I just need to make sure that it says something about the budget.

1017
01:29:34,771 --> 01:29:41,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it does say, okay, down on C, it does.

1018
01:29:41,773 --> 01:29:42,494
[SPEAKER_08]: It says all that.

1019
01:29:42,554 --> 01:29:42,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1020
01:29:43,754 --> 01:29:44,074
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1021
01:29:44,414 --> 01:29:46,055
[SPEAKER_08]: So you want to take out 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and leave in ABC.

1022
01:29:54,667 --> 01:30:00,209
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, on number four, it says that the school committee shall provide timely oversight and payment of bills.

1023
01:30:01,569 --> 01:30:06,130
[SPEAKER_08]: So it is said that that piece is actually, it's there.

1024
01:30:07,311 --> 01:30:08,871
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so why don't we do that?

1025
01:30:10,692 --> 01:30:11,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Does that work for everybody?

1026
01:30:12,552 --> 01:30:13,513
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes sense to me.

1027
01:30:13,593 --> 01:30:14,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, me too.

1028
01:30:14,773 --> 01:30:17,174
[SPEAKER_08]: We're taking out one, two, three, four, and five.

1029
01:30:18,552 --> 01:30:33,499
[SPEAKER_08]: We are leaving in, please, please, a voting majority of the school committee shall, I can't read my printer, yeah, shall exercise the following powers and perform the following duties, and no individual member is empowered to act unless by vote of the school committee.

1030
01:30:35,540 --> 01:30:36,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's critical.

1031
01:30:38,221 --> 01:30:40,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's understood.

1032
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:43,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, not always, Mara Milva.

1033
01:30:43,804 --> 01:30:45,324
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the concern?

1034
01:30:49,318 --> 01:30:59,807
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's boundaries, and there are times when there are members who like to work on their own and forget that they're part of the whole.

1035
01:31:00,507 --> 01:31:02,549
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's a good reminder.

1036
01:31:03,950 --> 01:31:04,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you give an example?

1037
01:31:04,991 --> 01:31:13,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Because what can they do outside of a meeting where they're deciding on things?

1038
01:31:13,778 --> 01:31:15,780
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what that means.

1039
01:31:16,605 --> 01:31:20,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, speak publicly as if it's a done deal, and it's not.

1040
01:31:21,367 --> 01:31:22,247
[SPEAKER_08]: It's their own opinion.

1041
01:31:22,467 --> 01:31:27,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's fine for them to speak as their own opinion, but it's always, it's just got to be clear.

1042
01:31:27,689 --> 01:31:36,112
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that the charter can police the speech of

1043
01:31:38,613 --> 01:31:40,174
[SPEAKER_09]: school committee members, do you?

1044
01:31:40,834 --> 01:31:45,555
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not asking for them to police the speech.

1045
01:31:46,355 --> 01:31:57,599
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm putting it out there that the school committee is, you have to have a majority.

1046
01:31:58,599 --> 01:32:00,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Just in the same way, Milved, let's do it this way.

1047
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:03,961
[SPEAKER_08]: You didn't want people to do postings

1048
01:32:04,837 --> 01:32:12,819
[SPEAKER_08]: that might reflect on the Charter Study Committee in some way that wasn't appropriate.

1049
01:32:15,119 --> 01:32:17,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember we had that discussion at some point?

1050
01:32:17,079 --> 01:32:20,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I think that was less of the concern.

1051
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:23,540
[SPEAKER_09]: The concern is... We speak with one voice.

1052
01:32:24,121 --> 01:32:27,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it was more about, you know, open meeting law and things like that.

1053
01:32:28,541 --> 01:32:28,761
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1054
01:32:28,922 --> 01:32:30,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I think that's the same.

1055
01:32:32,668 --> 01:32:36,049
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I've moved an awful lot on a lot of this stuff, so.

1056
01:32:36,089 --> 01:32:37,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I understand.

1057
01:32:37,549 --> 01:32:40,510
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess I also feel that it's a little vague.

1058
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:43,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I, you know, empowered to act.

1059
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:47,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how, you know, what does that mean exactly?

1060
01:32:47,092 --> 01:32:51,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody else find it vague?

1061
01:32:54,773 --> 01:32:55,133
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.

1062
01:32:55,153 --> 01:33:04,678
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it doesn't stop what you are saying, Paulette, because empowered to act implies passing those powers listed below.

1063
01:33:04,698 --> 01:33:15,183
[SPEAKER_01]: And because below that are A, B, and C, which is budget, making rules, and then overseeing the superintendent.

1064
01:33:16,057 --> 01:33:19,879
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so you want to take out the clause and no individual manager is empowered to act.

1065
01:33:20,359 --> 01:33:25,221
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll just say a voting majority of the school committee shall exercise the following powers and perform the following duties.

1066
01:33:25,582 --> 01:33:29,303
[SPEAKER_08]: It does say a voting majority, so it is redundant in that way.

1067
01:33:30,224 --> 01:33:30,524
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1068
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's cleaner.

1069
01:33:32,205 --> 01:33:35,767
[SPEAKER_08]: So just take it, if you would, Aubrey.

1070
01:33:35,787 --> 01:33:40,949
[SPEAKER_10]: I would.

1071
01:33:41,029 --> 01:33:41,089
[SPEAKER_10]: OK.

1072
01:33:45,125 --> 01:33:48,848
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything else that people want to look at in this article?

1073
01:33:50,569 --> 01:33:57,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do we feel like we want to, we're ready to vote and say this is ready to go into our pile of

1074
01:33:58,757 --> 01:33:59,917
[SPEAKER_09]: approved drafts.

1075
01:34:00,438 --> 01:34:01,718
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're all still drafts.

1076
01:34:02,699 --> 01:34:07,760
[SPEAKER_01]: There was something about the Collins Center about the filling of vacancies.

1077
01:34:08,021 --> 01:34:08,401
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.

1078
01:34:08,581 --> 01:34:10,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for that.

1079
01:34:11,262 --> 01:34:13,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Milva, that's true.

1080
01:34:13,443 --> 01:34:19,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that there's one when I was rereading it, there's a sentence that doesn't make sense.

1081
01:34:19,905 --> 01:34:22,426
[SPEAKER_08]: I know you want to vote on it tonight.

1082
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:27,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to look at it with, I haven't figured out how to fix it yet.

1083
01:34:28,511 --> 01:34:44,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so let's just look at this filling of vacancies and then if you want to clean it up based on or do the edits that we discussed, then we can vote another time.

1084
01:34:44,464 --> 01:34:54,932
[SPEAKER_09]: But let's look at the, so the question was in number three, which is in the event, which basically has, leaves the option for an at-large.

1085
01:34:55,963 --> 01:34:59,184
[SPEAKER_09]: school committee member to take the open ward seat, right?

1086
01:34:59,384 --> 01:35:00,525
[SPEAKER_09]: If they live in that ward.

1087
01:35:01,325 --> 01:35:01,545
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1088
01:35:03,726 --> 01:35:13,730
[SPEAKER_08]: So my assumption was that most people would rather run in a ward rather than at large.

1089
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:17,951
[SPEAKER_08]: But that was my assumption is that most people would rather

1090
01:35:19,929 --> 01:35:20,209
[SPEAKER_08]: run.

1091
01:35:21,390 --> 01:35:29,456
[SPEAKER_08]: But some people, there's already someone there who's been there and is very well entrenched.

1092
01:35:30,297 --> 01:35:44,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Now all of a sudden that person leaves and the person who's been running at large and spending all that money on an at-large campaign, if in the event that all of a sudden there was a vacancy, could that person move?

1093
01:35:48,883 --> 01:36:04,856
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the Collins Center had brought up an issue that they said maybe because the voters are voting on an at-large, an award, so that means you would basically be saying, OK, you voted on this, but now this person is not going to do that.

1094
01:36:05,457 --> 01:36:09,500
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess they thought that voters might not like it.

1095
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:10,741
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I understood.

1096
01:36:11,261 --> 01:36:15,845
[SPEAKER_08]: So the question is, what happens if there are at-large candidates,

1097
01:36:18,904 --> 01:36:23,546
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, there's no one else in the ward who wants to run.

1098
01:36:23,566 --> 01:36:30,870
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that is covered in subsection B. Okay.

1099
01:36:31,390 --> 01:36:31,790
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

1100
01:36:32,150 --> 01:36:33,931
[SPEAKER_09]: David, did you want to say something?

1101
01:36:34,411 --> 01:36:43,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, one more small issue I see with 3, which I think is solvable, is it doesn't provide a timeline for the person making a choice.

1102
01:36:45,692 --> 01:36:46,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.

1103
01:36:46,313 --> 01:36:52,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So sections one and two are pretty, or at least to me, implied to be immediate, right?

1104
01:36:52,198 --> 01:36:52,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Like.

1105
01:36:53,659 --> 01:36:58,924
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as the vacancy is there, somebody else is now kind of immediately on the committee.

1106
01:37:01,106 --> 01:37:07,692
[SPEAKER_05]: And this third one, I think at a bare minimum, if we were to choose to keep it in, should say that they have.

1107
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:14,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know whether, like, you know, they have to decide by the next meeting.

1108
01:37:14,514 --> 01:37:15,294
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a week.

1109
01:37:15,574 --> 01:37:21,735
[SPEAKER_05]: Either way, I also just think it's complicated in a way that I don't feel is, strictly speaking, necessary.

1110
01:37:21,855 --> 01:37:37,398
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we take it out, OK, if we take three out completely and then look at subsection B, if a vacancy shall occur in the office of school committee member and there is no available candidate to build a vacancy in the manner provided,

1111
01:37:39,691 --> 01:37:42,053
[SPEAKER_08]: The vacancy shall be filled by majority vote.

1112
01:37:46,137 --> 01:37:50,401
[SPEAKER_08]: If the vacancy occurs in a designated war seat, the person selected must reside in that ward.

1113
01:37:54,806 --> 01:38:01,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, well, so like, what if there's a what if so it sounds like if.

1114
01:38:02,932 --> 01:38:12,616
[SPEAKER_06]: the at-large person isn't filling the ward vacancy that you're choosing from the next highest votes for the at-large school committee members.

1115
01:38:12,957 --> 01:38:17,319
[SPEAKER_06]: But what if there was a next highest vote for a ward candidate?

1116
01:38:17,339 --> 01:38:21,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's already covered in one and two above it, in number.

1117
01:38:25,082 --> 01:38:25,822
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't.

1118
01:38:25,882 --> 01:38:26,082
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

1119
01:38:27,883 --> 01:38:35,610
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so this is just if there is nobody who ran that's available, right?

1120
01:38:36,371 --> 01:38:40,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, to my mind, subsection B covers it.

1121
01:38:41,235 --> 01:38:51,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so take out three, and we'll say subsection B covers it, and if that should occur, they'll figure it out.

1122
01:38:53,486 --> 01:38:54,487
[SPEAKER_09]: How do people feel about that?

1123
01:38:56,246 --> 01:39:04,828
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember we asked the call center about this question about like, they said it very rarely happens that there isn't someone like to fill the spot.

1124
01:39:05,288 --> 01:39:06,208
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's what they said.

1125
01:39:06,228 --> 01:39:06,448
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1126
01:39:07,028 --> 01:39:07,308
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1127
01:39:07,408 --> 01:39:15,630
[SPEAKER_09]: So this would, I mean, this subsection B would maybe never happen, but it's there if it needs to happen.

1128
01:39:17,611 --> 01:39:18,991
[SPEAKER_08]: We've seen the other charters.

1129
01:39:19,629 --> 01:39:19,849
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1130
01:39:19,869 --> 01:39:22,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, so I'm fine taking away three.

1131
01:39:22,892 --> 01:39:23,833
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, awesome.

1132
01:39:24,634 --> 01:39:30,119
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we made it through, and I think it's in great shape.

1133
01:39:30,659 --> 01:39:38,847
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you, Paulette, do you feel more comfortable if you just kind of incorporate what was discussed and then we bring it back?

1134
01:39:40,008 --> 01:39:40,228
[SPEAKER_09]: Well,

1135
01:39:42,825 --> 01:39:45,869
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate to just, I mean, I think in concept we're all there.

1136
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:50,834
[SPEAKER_08]: There's that piece of me that would like to read it through one more time as an entirety.

1137
01:39:51,675 --> 01:39:51,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1138
01:39:52,657 --> 01:39:54,118
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't want to hold things up either.

1139
01:39:54,298 --> 01:39:54,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

1140
01:39:54,759 --> 01:39:55,740
[SPEAKER_08]: How do other people feel?

1141
01:39:55,880 --> 01:39:56,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Aubrey?

1142
01:39:56,721 --> 01:40:03,169
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we still waiting for a decision about the very first thing we talked about tonight, the ward combining?

1143
01:40:05,114 --> 01:40:07,515
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we decided that we were good with that.

1144
01:40:07,655 --> 01:40:20,544
[SPEAKER_09]: We have more questions on it that we're going to try to get answered, but people like the idea, you know, people think that that's a good way to compose the school committee.

1145
01:40:21,246 --> 01:40:26,270
[SPEAKER_10]: So voting yes on this text would mean I'm voting yes to figuring out how that would work at a later date.

1146
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:31,774
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, basically, it means yes, we're voting this draft as an approved draft.

1147
01:40:31,994 --> 01:40:39,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultimately, the Collins Center is going to take all our drafts and look at them and they'll, you know, they'll make notes and tell us, you know,

1148
01:40:40,844 --> 01:40:45,805
[SPEAKER_09]: if something doesn't seem right or, you know, we suggest that you add more detail here or whatever.

1149
01:40:47,085 --> 01:40:52,866
[SPEAKER_09]: But so it's still in draft form, you know, so it's... Yeah, that's okay.

1150
01:40:52,926 --> 01:40:58,888
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just not sure when in the process we have to say wards one and five will be combined.

1151
01:40:59,228 --> 01:41:02,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and that is something we need to get answered.

1152
01:41:02,748 --> 01:41:04,989
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to get an answer to that question for sure.

1153
01:41:05,969 --> 01:41:09,890
[SPEAKER_08]: So should we say now we'll just lay it on the table to the next meeting?

1154
01:41:10,788 --> 01:41:13,589
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, no, Daveed, go ahead.

1155
01:41:13,669 --> 01:41:18,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I would personally prefer to just like, let's have a vote to accept it in principle.

1156
01:41:19,272 --> 01:41:20,912
[SPEAKER_05]: We can always come back and look at it again.

1157
01:41:20,932 --> 01:41:29,316
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it'd be really good in terms of like making forward progress to kind of say, assuming nobody brings it back up, we're pretty happy with where this is at.

1158
01:41:29,636 --> 01:41:36,079
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure before we submit it to wherever it's going next, we can come back and revisit it.

1159
01:41:36,934 --> 01:41:47,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I I motion to, you know, except except article four as revised as revised.

1160
01:41:48,003 --> 01:41:48,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1161
01:41:48,503 --> 01:41:49,224
[SPEAKER_09]: I second it.

1162
01:41:49,564 --> 01:41:50,205
[SPEAKER_09]: I can second.

1163
01:41:50,265 --> 01:41:50,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1164
01:41:50,785 --> 01:41:51,566
[SPEAKER_09]: All in favor.

1165
01:41:51,666 --> 01:41:55,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we want to roll call?

1166
01:41:55,269 --> 01:41:57,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're unanimous.

1167
01:41:58,031 --> 01:41:58,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent.

1168
01:41:58,812 --> 01:42:03,015
[SPEAKER_10]: We're unanimous in that unanimous and thankful for the considerations given today.

1169
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:09,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you to Paulette for all of the amazing work.

1170
01:42:09,412 --> 01:42:10,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Paulette.

1171
01:42:10,853 --> 01:42:11,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1172
01:42:12,034 --> 01:42:14,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much.

1173
01:42:14,315 --> 01:42:15,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to the committee.

1174
01:42:15,736 --> 01:42:16,097
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1175
01:42:17,838 --> 01:42:21,260
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have a lot of time, but Article 7 isn't long.

1176
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:22,561
[SPEAKER_09]: Did everybody look at it?

1177
01:42:23,401 --> 01:42:23,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1178
01:42:25,344 --> 01:42:35,924
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any, there was one question that I tried to head off about the elections commission, and I did, it was right before the meeting, so many of you may not have had a chance to look at it.

1179
01:42:37,844 --> 01:42:44,287
[SPEAKER_09]: because there had been the question, should we define the Elections Commission, right?

1180
01:42:44,307 --> 01:42:44,907
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1181
01:42:46,207 --> 01:42:59,954
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, the Collins Center said it is defined in state law, and they gave us example language from a few charters that do have sections about it, but also said that these sections essentially mirror state law.

1182
01:43:01,415 --> 01:43:05,997
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we did choose to add that, we would basically just be kind of

1183
01:43:07,824 --> 01:43:10,987
[SPEAKER_09]: adding the details of state law into the charter.

1184
01:43:12,910 --> 01:43:13,270
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm good.

1185
01:43:14,051 --> 01:43:14,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1186
01:43:14,812 --> 01:43:17,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I just have one question that I did add.

1187
01:43:17,655 --> 01:43:18,616
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a quick one.

1188
01:43:19,117 --> 01:43:19,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1189
01:43:19,958 --> 01:43:22,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it says register our voters, should that be the elections office?

1190
01:43:24,831 --> 01:43:28,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I mean, because that's how it's referred to in Medford.

1191
01:43:29,155 --> 01:43:30,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that right?

1192
01:43:30,196 --> 01:43:32,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's the elections office here in Medford.

1193
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:37,001
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's in there twice.

1194
01:43:37,642 --> 01:43:40,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because that's probably language from another charter.

1195
01:43:41,825 --> 01:43:50,673
[SPEAKER_09]: But it would be more consistent with what we say in Medford if we change it to elections office, right?

1196
01:43:51,769 --> 01:43:54,732
[SPEAKER_09]: That's officially what it's called in Medford, the elections office.

1197
01:43:54,772 --> 01:43:56,533
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just check the city website.

1198
01:43:56,573 --> 01:43:57,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on a sec.

1199
01:43:58,955 --> 01:44:03,779
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, um, it was elections office or elections department.

1200
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:04,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1201
01:44:04,580 --> 01:44:10,325
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also don't know if registrar of voters is kind of like an official term that, um,

1202
01:44:12,142 --> 01:44:16,726
[SPEAKER_09]: is how the state sees it, no matter what we call it, for instance.

1203
01:44:16,866 --> 01:44:18,127
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I'm not sure about that.

1204
01:44:18,867 --> 01:44:25,232
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something, again, that the Collins Center would flag if we change it to elections office, and it should change back to let us know.

1205
01:44:26,173 --> 01:44:28,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, just, you know, kind of want to keep that.

1206
01:44:29,715 --> 01:44:30,716
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1207
01:44:30,776 --> 01:44:35,319
[SPEAKER_09]: So we want to change registrar of voters to elections office.

1208
01:44:36,221 --> 01:44:39,782
[SPEAKER_09]: just to be consistent with terminology, Medford's terminology.

1209
01:44:41,122 --> 01:44:43,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody, everybody's good with that?

1210
01:44:44,463 --> 01:44:44,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

1211
01:44:44,743 --> 01:44:46,244
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1212
01:44:48,344 --> 01:44:56,467
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, we will have to, since we did talk about ward representation for school committee, that language will have to be altered, right?

1213
01:44:59,308 --> 01:45:01,208
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a simple addition, so.

1214
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:06,634
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just make a note of that.

1215
01:45:09,936 --> 01:45:10,456
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other?

1216
01:45:10,476 --> 01:45:15,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Frances, you have something in the chat.

1217
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:17,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Melba, did you see the chat?

1218
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:19,441
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm about to look.

1219
01:45:20,642 --> 01:45:21,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Elections Commission.

1220
01:45:22,182 --> 01:45:22,543
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1221
01:45:23,883 --> 01:45:24,204
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1222
01:45:24,904 --> 01:45:30,147
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll change that to Elections Commission, and if- Thanks, Frances.

1223
01:45:30,727 --> 01:45:31,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Issue that, yeah.

1224
01:45:32,008 --> 01:45:32,588
[SPEAKER_09]: You're welcome.

1225
01:45:35,235 --> 01:45:38,436
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was the question of wards, Jean.

1226
01:45:38,716 --> 01:45:41,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Go ahead.

1227
01:45:41,917 --> 01:45:52,119
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more, going back to my consistency thing, which maybe the Collins Center will catch, is some places we say we might expand wards, and other places we say eight wards.

1228
01:45:53,599 --> 01:45:55,020
[SPEAKER_01]: And in here, we say eight wards.

1229
01:45:55,060 --> 01:45:59,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just not always consistently presented.

1230
01:46:00,261 --> 01:46:00,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1231
01:46:01,116 --> 01:46:04,857
[SPEAKER_05]: The expansion might be something that I invented in thinking through article two.

1232
01:46:05,698 --> 01:46:15,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm starting to get the feeling that it is not at least normal to kind of design your charter around the possibility of expansion.

1233
01:46:16,261 --> 01:46:20,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we did get a memo on the call-in center about wards.

1234
01:46:22,488 --> 01:46:26,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll have to dig it up and just redistribute it so we can look at it.

1235
01:46:26,949 --> 01:46:32,290
[SPEAKER_09]: But I do think, Jean, that if there's any weird language about wards, the Collins Center will catch it.

1236
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:32,850
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll catch it.

1237
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:33,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's all.

1238
01:46:33,851 --> 01:46:34,431
[SPEAKER_09]: I think so.

1239
01:46:36,371 --> 01:46:36,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1240
01:46:37,331 --> 01:46:39,372
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a pretty straight ahead.

1241
01:46:39,392 --> 01:46:43,413
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, this subcommittee, you know, this was a quickie.

1242
01:46:43,473 --> 01:46:47,413
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a pretty straight ahead section.

1243
01:46:47,433 --> 01:46:49,534
[SPEAKER_09]: I mostly approve.

1244
01:46:51,190 --> 01:46:57,021
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, the only thing we did look at was number of signatures, but nobody has any issues with the number of signatures we picked.

1245
01:46:58,928 --> 01:47:08,915
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also did look at, just so everybody, we did about names on the ballot.

1246
01:47:09,456 --> 01:47:19,743
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to a system where the incumbents aren't always listed at the top of the ballot, which is a pretty major change.

1247
01:47:19,763 --> 01:47:25,187
[SPEAKER_03]: This is something that in Medford, there had been a lot of back and forth over,

1248
01:47:25,907 --> 01:47:31,569
[SPEAKER_03]: over decades with this particular issue.

1249
01:47:31,789 --> 01:47:52,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And we looked at some studies conducted by MIT, which looked at different elections, and that it was statistically significant that when people are chosen at random for the position on the ballot, they have

1250
01:47:53,676 --> 01:48:08,529
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fairer and that the, you know, there is a slight increase in the level of chance of someone being elected if they're chosen.

1251
01:48:08,909 --> 01:48:14,715
[SPEAKER_03]: The position is at random rather than at the bottom of the ballot or on the second page of a ballot.

1252
01:48:15,633 --> 01:48:20,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's why we put that for ballot position, which would definitely be a change.

1253
01:48:20,836 --> 01:48:24,699
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like a small change, but it's probably a pretty big one, actually, for elections.

1254
01:48:25,519 --> 01:48:26,440
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second the motion.

1255
01:48:27,181 --> 01:48:27,441
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1256
01:48:28,842 --> 01:48:29,202
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1257
01:48:30,923 --> 01:48:32,144
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do a roll call.

1258
01:48:33,945 --> 01:48:38,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Paulette.

1259
01:48:39,789 --> 01:48:40,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Paulette, did you hear me?

1260
01:48:41,110 --> 01:48:41,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry.

1261
01:48:43,578 --> 01:48:46,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you voting yes or no to accept Article 7, the draft?

1262
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:46,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1263
01:48:47,281 --> 01:48:48,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1264
01:48:48,862 --> 01:48:49,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Aubrey?

1265
01:48:50,123 --> 01:48:50,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1266
01:48:51,984 --> 01:48:52,264
[SPEAKER_09]: Jean?

1267
01:48:52,925 --> 01:48:53,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1268
01:48:54,306 --> 01:48:54,766
[SPEAKER_09]: Danielle?

1269
01:48:55,647 --> 01:48:55,887
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1270
01:48:56,367 --> 01:48:56,808
[SPEAKER_09]: David?

1271
01:48:57,328 --> 01:48:57,548
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1272
01:48:58,889 --> 01:48:59,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Eunice?

1273
01:48:59,650 --> 01:48:59,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1274
01:49:00,650 --> 01:49:01,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Phyllis?

1275
01:49:01,791 --> 01:49:02,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1276
01:49:02,732 --> 01:49:03,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Anthony?

1277
01:49:03,713 --> 01:49:03,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1278
01:49:04,533 --> 01:49:05,154
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm yes.

1279
01:49:05,814 --> 01:49:07,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay, another unanimous vote.

1280
01:49:07,735 --> 01:49:08,176
[SPEAKER_09]: Awesome.

1281
01:49:08,576 --> 01:49:09,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Congrats.

1282
01:49:10,779 --> 01:49:12,400
[SPEAKER_09]: David, did you raise your hand, sir?

1283
01:49:12,420 --> 01:49:13,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I did.

1284
01:49:13,281 --> 01:49:13,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1285
01:49:13,781 --> 01:49:26,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So given that we only have a couple minutes left, I was wondering if I might bump something in the agenda, which is I know that we have a lot of comments left on articles two and three.

1286
01:49:28,148 --> 01:49:41,660
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm wondering, I'd like to move that we have another meeting of the article two and three subcommittee and invite folks to come and give us comments and kind of revisit that.

1287
01:49:42,121 --> 01:49:44,083
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you, what were the questions?

1288
01:49:44,123 --> 01:49:46,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause I thought we voted that through the draft.

1289
01:49:47,646 --> 01:49:49,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so I was gone last month.

1290
01:49:50,242 --> 01:49:51,823
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, no, we voted that through.

1291
01:49:52,244 --> 01:49:52,544
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, great.

1292
01:49:52,584 --> 01:49:54,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we're good.

1293
01:49:54,145 --> 01:49:57,228
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like there's still a lot of questions left on that, but all good.

1294
01:49:57,268 --> 01:49:59,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I can go through and resolve them all.

1295
01:49:59,650 --> 01:50:03,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I just have to resolve them.

1296
01:50:03,373 --> 01:50:05,014
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, awesome.

1297
01:50:05,214 --> 01:50:10,198
[SPEAKER_09]: And we only have a couple of minutes, and so we won't have really time to talk about it.

1298
01:50:10,238 --> 01:50:17,964
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just want to put it up on the screen and say, because next meeting, we are going to do this Article 8.

1299
01:50:19,219 --> 01:50:23,845
[SPEAKER_09]: We're also going to look at Article 6, which is the budget financial procedures.

1300
01:50:24,266 --> 01:50:29,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we don't have subcommittees for Articles 1, 5, 9, and 10.

1301
01:50:29,753 --> 01:50:31,476
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of it is a boilerplate.

1302
01:50:31,576 --> 01:50:34,740
[SPEAKER_09]: But what I'd like to do is go through

1303
01:50:35,898 --> 01:50:44,441
[SPEAKER_09]: those articles and pick out things that I think that we need to decide on, like, for instance, regular charter review, things like that.

1304
01:50:45,161 --> 01:50:53,923
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's one of the things I'm going to maybe ask people to do for the next meeting is review Article 8, review Article 6, and look at those other pieces.

1305
01:50:54,023 --> 01:50:55,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll send this all to you in an email.

1306
01:50:56,865 --> 01:51:00,487
[SPEAKER_09]: and see if there's anything in particular that you want to raise.

1307
01:51:00,827 --> 01:51:15,477
[SPEAKER_09]: So those we will not draft like we've drafted the other articles, but we will do is we'll make the decisions and then the call-in center will review the drafts we've created and then they will draft those other articles for us and then we will have a draft charter.

1308
01:51:17,038 --> 01:51:17,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Paulette.

1309
01:51:18,338 --> 01:51:24,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I just, you'll send, I was looking for those other articles and I couldn't access them.

1310
01:51:25,200 --> 01:51:26,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, send them out to us.

1311
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:27,720
[SPEAKER_09]: I will send them around.

1312
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:28,060
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1313
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1314
01:51:30,261 --> 01:51:39,003
[SPEAKER_09]: And basically, you know, hopefully some of you have taken a look at this, but when, when the subcommittee met sort of some of the main questions that we had that.

1315
01:51:40,192 --> 01:51:52,636
[SPEAKER_09]: We did put numbers in, but we also felt that we wanted the whole committee to look at some of these numbers as well, these timelines on the signatures and the signatures and timelines.

1316
01:51:53,236 --> 01:51:57,097
[SPEAKER_09]: And Eunice did this great research, and you can see it all in the margin where

1317
01:51:59,483 --> 01:52:05,085
[SPEAKER_09]: where she outlined sort of the differences in how communities handle these things.

1318
01:52:05,185 --> 01:52:25,171
[SPEAKER_09]: So basically, I think the subcommittee was in agreement that we wanted these mechanisms to be available to the public, but there's a pretty wide range in timelines and thresholds, and we wanted to give the whole committee a chance to look at that and try to make some of those decisions.

1319
01:52:25,891 --> 01:52:27,612
[SPEAKER_09]: So for next time,

1320
01:52:28,896 --> 01:52:37,579
[SPEAKER_09]: If you could carefully look at that and come up with proposals, and we'll try to get those timelines and thresholds nailed down.

1321
01:52:37,879 --> 01:52:43,941
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll have Article 8, and then we'll have the budget discussion or the financial procedures discussion.

1322
01:52:43,961 --> 01:52:50,503
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think in June, we're going to pretty much have a draft charter.

1323
01:52:51,384 --> 01:52:57,186
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we'll be looking at creating a final report and a presentation for the fall.

1324
01:52:58,510 --> 01:53:04,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Eunice, um, yeah, I just be curious and maybe it's something that we could talk about.

1325
01:53:06,313 --> 01:53:14,996
[SPEAKER_04]: When we meet again in 2 weeks, but now with summer coming and everybody kind of going in different directions, how much work.

1326
01:53:15,936 --> 01:53:18,457
[SPEAKER_04]: Is left of the committee what kinds of.

1327
01:53:19,817 --> 01:53:41,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Aside from our first Thursday of the month meeting, and I guess it's the second Thursday in July because of the holiday, from June through September, what kinds of time commitments are we looking at other than that one Thursday meeting?

1328
01:53:41,645 --> 01:53:43,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Will there be other subcommittees?

1329
01:53:44,226 --> 01:53:45,507
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going to be putting together

1330
01:53:46,727 --> 01:53:48,727
[SPEAKER_04]: The, you know, final draft charter.

1331
01:53:48,747 --> 01:53:52,488
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what, what kind of time are we giving to this during the summer?

1332
01:53:52,688 --> 01:53:56,489
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is what I envision is that our next meeting we're going to get.

1333
01:53:57,350 --> 01:54:06,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Articles 8 and 6 done over the over the next meeting in 2 weeks and the 1st meeting in June, we're going to get those 2 articles done and we're going to.

1334
01:54:08,302 --> 01:54:09,723
[SPEAKER_09]: lay out the decisions.

1335
01:54:09,743 --> 01:54:12,905
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to have the decisions made on those other articles.

1336
01:54:12,985 --> 01:54:15,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them, like Article 1, is just definitions.

1337
01:54:15,466 --> 01:54:17,868
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not really anything we need to even decide on.

1338
01:54:17,948 --> 01:54:22,371
[SPEAKER_09]: It's more, you know, something that we need to include in the document.

1339
01:54:23,051 --> 01:54:33,798
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and then there will be, we'll see how people feel, who wants to be involved in writing the final report, for instance.

1340
01:54:36,047 --> 01:54:42,128
[SPEAKER_09]: In June, we would, if all goes as planned, we will hand over our draft and our decisions to the Collins Center.

1341
01:54:42,148 --> 01:54:45,709
[SPEAKER_09]: So they'll spend whatever time they need to spend going through that.

1342
01:54:46,969 --> 01:54:53,150
[SPEAKER_09]: And then maybe in August, say at that meeting, we would be looking at their notes and seeing if there's any changes we need to make.

1343
01:54:53,830 --> 01:55:01,712
[SPEAKER_09]: But over the summer, there will be a committee or whoever wants to be involved in creating the final report.

1344
01:55:02,072 --> 01:55:04,092
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know how many people are interested in that.

1345
01:55:05,280 --> 01:55:07,061
[SPEAKER_09]: It will involve writing, basically.

1346
01:55:10,603 --> 01:55:13,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have samples of what?

1347
01:55:13,565 --> 01:55:14,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1348
01:55:15,366 --> 01:55:19,668
[SPEAKER_09]: I can put together some final reports and share them and see what people think.

1349
01:55:19,748 --> 01:55:24,691
[SPEAKER_09]: But, I mean, I'm going to be working on it, so we'll make a subcommittee.

1350
01:55:24,911 --> 01:55:32,635
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I guess, Eunice, the question about what the time commitment is, is it depends on whether you want to be involved in writing a final report.

1351
01:55:35,696 --> 01:55:38,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, and I guess that would be helpful.

1352
01:55:42,333 --> 01:56:10,402
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just wondering, are we over between now and the fall going to update the community at all on our progress, on any of our findings, just to see if there's still anything lingering out in the community that needs to be, you know, kind of, you know, I'm just thinking that, you know, we asked the community a lot of questions, like, it's over a year ago now.

1353
01:56:11,062 --> 01:56:21,455
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and like, do we, are we just at this point disengaged from the community or are we, you know, is there anything that we will be doing this summer?

1354
01:56:22,538 --> 01:56:33,126
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I wouldn't say we're disengaged, but if we did anything this summer in terms of a public event, it would be to sort of talk about what our work is.

1355
01:56:34,747 --> 01:56:38,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we'll have pretty much put together the draft charter by that time.

1356
01:56:39,371 --> 01:56:42,473
[SPEAKER_04]: And summer is not the best time to be engaging the community in anything.

1357
01:56:42,854 --> 01:56:56,805
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I know that, but I'm just wondering if, you know, if, if before, you know, this goes to the city council, should we allow, like have, have, you know, run it through the community first.

1358
01:56:57,245 --> 01:57:01,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know to kind of get more kind of momentum.

1359
01:57:03,190 --> 01:57:07,874
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just trying to think of how it's going to go down, down at the end.

1360
01:57:08,748 --> 01:57:12,131
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, Anthony, if you if you have any ideas for an event like that.

1361
01:57:12,552 --> 01:57:12,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Um.

1362
01:57:13,693 --> 01:57:16,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Think, you know, and you want to present some of those ideas at our next meeting.

1363
01:57:16,836 --> 01:57:17,517
[SPEAKER_09]: We can do that.

1364
01:57:17,537 --> 01:57:18,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1365
01:57:20,051 --> 01:57:22,273
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's 8.30, so we need to wrap up.

1366
01:57:22,513 --> 01:57:26,635
[SPEAKER_09]: But I hope that answered your question, Eunice, and I hope that other people have an idea.

1367
01:57:26,655 --> 01:57:34,720
[SPEAKER_04]: We can see some draft reports to see how involved this is.

1368
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:35,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1369
01:57:35,961 --> 01:57:41,764
[SPEAKER_09]: I will be sending the material for the next meeting and the agenda soon because it's in two weeks.

1370
01:57:41,924 --> 01:57:43,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, really good work tonight.

1371
01:57:43,445 --> 01:57:44,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much to everybody.
