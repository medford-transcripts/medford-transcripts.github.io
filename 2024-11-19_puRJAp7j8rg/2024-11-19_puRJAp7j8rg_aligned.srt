1
00:01:30,287 --> 00:01:33,249
The fourth regular meeting of the Memphis City Council will now come to order.

2
00:01:33,749 --> 00:01:35,070
Clerk Urnaby, please call the roll.

3
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:35,731
Councilor Bares.

4
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:35,911
Present.

5
00:01:37,071 --> 00:01:37,932
Vice President Caravaglia.

6
00:01:38,252 --> 00:01:38,452
Present.

7
00:01:38,893 --> 00:01:39,413
Councilor Knight.

8
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:39,653
Present.

9
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:40,834
Councilor Marks.

10
00:01:40,854 --> 00:01:41,134
Present.

11
00:01:41,714 --> 00:01:42,275
Councilor Morrell.

12
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:42,675
Present.

13
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:44,196
Councilor Scarpelli.

14
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:44,556
Present.

15
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:45,717
President Falco.

16
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:46,137
Present.

17
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:46,978
Seven present.

18
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,159
At this time, could everyone please rise to salute the flag.

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,322
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

20
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:58,648
Under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

21
00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:00,489
Mr. President, I move to suspend the rules to take a paper out of order.

22
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:08,415
On the motion of Councilor Knight to suspend the rules to take a paper out of order, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

23
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:09,196
All those in favor?

24
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,256
All those opposed?

25
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:11,858
The motion passes.

26
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:13,519
Councilor Knight.

27
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:17,221
Mr. President, I move to take paper 2013 out of order.

28
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:19,323
This was a paper that was before the council previously.

29
00:02:19,383 --> 00:02:23,226
We sent it back to the mayor with a request for amendment and it has come back as

30
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:25,055
The council amended it.

31
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:32,119
I'd like to ask a representative from the administration to come up and just give us a brief synopsis of the paper that's before us, and then hopefully move for a vote.

32
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,100
Thank you, Council Light.

33
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,383
If you could please have a representative from the administration.

34
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:41,624
If you could please have your name and address for the record, please.

35
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:45,346
Alicia Nunley Benjamin, Finance Director for the City of Medford.

36
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:46,707
Good evening, Honorable Councilors.

37
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:52,090
The home rule petition before you is to create a special revenue fund for our

38
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,796
casino money which was amended now to be by appropriation by this honorable body.

39
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:14,658
Mr. President, I do believe, Mr. President, that the special revenue fund was a recommendation that was made by the Division of Local Services from the Department of Revenue to establish generally accepted accounting practices on how to spend the funds that come with these host community agreements and community impact agreements.

40
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:24,099
Based upon the language that's been provided to us and the review of the language that's been provided to us previously, it seems as though everything's in order and the recommendations of the council have been adopted by the administration.

41
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,120
As such, I'd move for approval of the paper.

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,960
The first reading.

43
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:31,305
On the motion of- No, no, it's actually a home rule petition, it's going to the legislature.

44
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:34,286
Excuse me, Councilor, Councilor Knight, can you repeat that, please?

45
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,367
It's a home rule petition, so it will go to the legislature.

46
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:36,547
Yes.

47
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:42,130
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Carter-Bees, please call the roll.

48
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:47,652
Councilor Behrs?

49
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:47,993
Yes.

50
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:49,833
Vice President Carabiello?

51
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:50,374
Yes.

52
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:51,334
Councilor Knight?

53
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:51,794
Yes.

54
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:52,835
Councilor Marks?

55
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:53,195
Yes.

56
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:54,456
Councilor Morrell?

57
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:54,536
Yes.

58
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:56,076
Councilor Scarpelli?

59
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:56,577
Yes.

60
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:57,337
President Falco?

61
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:57,437
Yes.

62
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,680
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

63
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,580
The motion passes.

64
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:05,082
If I may, really quick, Council Marks.

65
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:06,102
Clerk Urtubis.

66
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:09,964
I have the paperwork for you to sign the petition.

67
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:15,026
So I just want you to sign the petition before we, if we can do that before advancing to further business.

68
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:17,267
That's acceptable to council?

69
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:18,047
Yes.

70
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:25,430
Mr. President, after we've done signing, can we take paper 20-048?

71
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:26,691
Yes, we can.

72
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:27,411
Second.

73
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,201
If we could please, the clerk will need that back.

74
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:15,561
Thank you.

75
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:16,041
Thank you.

76
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:45,436
Okay, while we're under suspension, petitions, presentations, and similar papers, 20-048, petition by Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, to speak on the city's zoning and discuss city's finances.

77
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:48,678
If we could please have your name and address for the record, please.

78
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:54,800
Good evening, my name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, and a former member of the Saugus body.

79
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,761
I come here tonight

80
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:15,048
To make some comments on issues that I feel are important as it relates to this upcoming budget, from what I understand this administration, and I know the Chief of Staff is here, he can reflect upon the fact that you guys and Lady are going to get an early budget this year, earlier than normal.

81
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:16,449
If that's true, I don't know.

82
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:16,930
Is it true?

83
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:18,548
So he says we hope so.

84
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:29,130
With that being said, and with two new counselors on the board, I would just like to reflect upon a couple of things as it relates to what really has not been addressed for the past few months.

85
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:44,733
First of all, going back to last year at some point in time regarding the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, we never got a report back from the auditor's office as it relates to the outpatient surgical offices that are going to be housed

86
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:55,079
in the old Lawrence Memorial Hospital as part of an addendum to the 16,000 square foot building that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to have their surgical center at.

87
00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:02,403
And with that being said, again, it's just out there floating around not knowing what's going to happen because they haven't made a decision.

88
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:07,286
Second of all, it's the taxing of the nonprofit funeral portion

89
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:14,788
of the operation at the Gaffey Funeral Home, which houses the Islamic Cultural Center here in Medford.

90
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:25,431
And where they're going to be running a funeral business out of that center, once again, it presents itself as a for-profit business within the non-profit structure itself.

91
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,832
Again, no answers come back on that as of yet.

92
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:34,814
And these are issues that I think need to be discussed and resolved before or at least during your budget.

93
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:43,741
Also, let's go back to something that Councilor Caviello, when he first came on to the Council, talked about, the disrepair of the schools.

94
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:50,348
At that point in time, Councilor Caviello indicated during his first term, it was $1.2 million of school repairs.

95
00:08:50,908 --> 00:09:00,917
We're now in excess of $1.5 million of school repairs, and we're getting ourselves right into the same position, I shouldn't say ourselves, the city is getting itself into this position

96
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,999
of why we had to build new schools in the first place.

97
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:08,141
If the upkeep is not going to be taking place, there is something wrong with that.

98
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:17,125
The building of a new police station, contained within the building of the new police station, it's 5,000 square feet less than what was asked for.

99
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:22,567
There is no police firing range that is for qualification.

100
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:28,890
But more importantly, the sad part about the whole thing, no police vehicle is going to be able to be housed internally.

101
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,251
They're all going to be outside.

102
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:36,269
And by doing that, all you're doing is leaving all your public service vehicles open to the elements.

103
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,533
So if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be, every police officer's gonna have to go out there and take the snow off it.

104
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:53,343
And you try to explain that to the people of this community and you tell them that you're spending close to $20 million for a new police station, but you have no place to house or at least care for your police cruisers.

105
00:09:54,656 --> 00:10:06,161
A very important issue that seems to be lost in the weeds is the, at present, if not more, a $29 million unfunded pension liability that needs to be paid by 2029.

106
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,002
That is yet to be discussed.

107
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:14,444
Also, what needs to be addressed right now also is a citywide

108
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:20,957
It's called the Citywide Home Water Meter Battery Replacement Program.

109
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:31,363
Now for those of you that have a house and you know when you get your water and sewer bill, the system was put in well over 10 years ago with meters that were only good for 10 years.

110
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:36,465
The 10 years have come and gone, that's a cost factor and that's a replacement that needs to take place.

111
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:45,950
We still have yet to receive a cost projection for a new fire station as to where it will be, when it will be, and what it will cost.

112
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,710
There is no projections out there.

113
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:56,734
And still outstanding is the new training tower that was promised it would be built before the old one was taken down.

114
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:01,636
Well, the old one has been taken down, and now nothing has been put up.

115
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:05,838
And in fact, it does affect, in the city of Medford, your home insurance rates.

116
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:12,655
There's no financial outline as to how the city's annual free cash should be prioritized.

117
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:21,678
For the new councils coming on board, for the last few many years, it's almost a million dollars each and every year the city of Medford has left over, it just goes into free cash.

118
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:24,339
So that presents itself with one or two arguments.

119
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:33,782
Number one, the budget is either not accurate, or number two, that million dollars is maybe not correct when the budget is being voted upon at the time.

120
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:35,283
So therefore,

121
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:40,828
To me, it makes very good sense because a lot of cities and towns do this.

122
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:48,752
You folks pass a budget in May or June, let's call it June, that should be the time you set your tax rate, not six months later.

123
00:11:49,672 --> 00:12:00,658
So if you do that, you're working on an actual annual budget that reflects upon that vote that took place in June that represents itself to each and every dollar itemized.

124
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:16,189
Also, a public works five-year projection program that covers our streets, our sidewalks, our tree stumps, our equipment, our water repairs issues, and cemetery, as well as all personnel that's gonna be needed to address that.

125
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:28,539
That would be a great program to have because number one, we're already understaffed and we're hiring immediately just two more people to work in the highway department that just basically on a daily basis is so understaffed and on demand.

126
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:35,376
Lastly, for the purposes of at least this portion of the discussion, two points.

127
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:40,117
And I know Councilor Caviello once again has asked for this and Councilor Marks, you've asked for this.

128
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:48,319
You should get a five-year financial recap from Park Medford on all the receipts taken in and what has been given to the City of Medford.

129
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:54,801
I guarantee none of you have received anything from Park Medford as it relates to that financial responsibility.

130
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:58,502
And lastly, Councilor Marks, you brought this up, yet to be determined

131
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:04,825
Where and for what reasons has the $500,000 from Tufts University been accounted for?

132
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:05,985
You still don't know.

133
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:07,006
We still don't know.

134
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:09,907
Now moving over to the housing issue.

135
00:13:11,345 --> 00:13:16,387
And here's an issue right now that's in the forefront of everything as to what's going on.

136
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:19,367
So let's just mention a few little things that are going on.

137
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:26,249
Right now what we have on the books are 185 units that are coming online after Wendy's on Middlesex Ave.

138
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,351
You have 300 plus units opposite the Wellington Station.

139
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:37,553
You have a proposed 400 Chapter 40B units next to the Middlesex Courthouse on Mystic Valley Parkway.

140
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:55,090
And looking at the smaller neighborhood issue that took place on Forest Street, where a private developer wanted to maximize a single-family residence to a multi-family use zone, that caused a tremendous amount of consultation not only to the neighborhood, but the Memphis Historical Commission.

141
00:13:56,195 --> 00:14:02,622
Going back, you go to 61 Toro Street, where you had an old magnificent home over there for which Tufts University was involved.

142
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,405
And they sort of like wanted to take advantage of the property.

143
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:08,929
But through the neighborhood pushing back, that didn't take place.

144
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:20,719
Right now, as of tomorrow night, you're going to have before the Board of Appeals, where the old Titan gas station is on Boston Avenue and Harvard Street, a condominium proposed development.

145
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,341
And then you have rumored development of a new condos behind the Middlesex Avenue Mall.

146
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:32,083
Once again, a rumored development of 30 plus condos on South Street.

147
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:36,065
And a rumored Boston Avenue multi-housing development.

148
00:14:38,123 --> 00:14:46,449
Then, at the end of last summer, 500 multi-use development was proposed by Combined Properties of Malden.

149
00:14:47,529 --> 00:15:03,280
And after a large community opposition, led by then City Councilor and now Mayor, Lungo Kern, as well as Gene Nuzzo and Cheryl Rodriguez, the project was forced to be scrapped by the developer.

150
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,142
Now, some six months later,

151
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:23,252
This same company, Combined Properties, is now proposing a 37, 378 residential unit, and the application for approval is coming along under a Chapter 40B proposal, entirely different than what they originally had.

152
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:31,538
The real wake-up call to this whole issue right now on housing here in the City of Medford should have taken place at 61 Locust Street.

153
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:39,965
The massive development that is opposite Wegmans right now, which was originally scheduled for over 500 units, and they've culled it down to 345.

154
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:44,253
Neighborhood protests pushed it back.

155
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:48,515
But as in any big business development, what did they do?

156
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:58,799
They went into the neighbors that were pushing back and they bought every single home over there for them to at least come back with $345,000 and still make the money that they're going to be made.

157
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:06,985
As I said some years ago, and as I said during this past campaign, the City of Medford needs to embark on a moratorium.

158
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:14,467
A moratorium on its zoning, and more importantly, a complete review of its zoning here in the City of Medford.

159
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,208
And the reason why the moratorium would work

160
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,953
is because our zoning has not been reviewed for a multitude of years.

161
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:44,343
So you're saying to any proposed developer that comes in, I will propose this affordable housing, which is not the same as a Chapter 40B, because remember, affordable housing is something that's compensated in part or given great latitude by state laws, whereas a Chapter 40B is a private independent entity coming in there.

162
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:46,644
So sure, they'll give you their affordable housing.

163
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:50,586
but they'll back in the cost on the remaining units that are in the building.

164
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:54,929
So how does that qualify and justify for an affordable housing process?

165
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:55,929
I don't know.

166
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:03,253
But also, you should be looking into what they call a growth management proposal.

167
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:12,399
And the reason why I say that is because we have right here in our own city, a sister city, it's called Malden, Massachusetts.

168
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:25,116
And in 2015, they put a question on the ballot, and their ballot question revolved around what you have been talking about, Councilor Falco, the Malden Hospital, what we're going to do with it.

169
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:30,540
The second thing is the Community Preservation Act, what are we gonna do with that as far as open space?

170
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,764
And their third question was the moratorium on high-density, multi-level development.

171
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:41,987
It won by 71% of the vote, and they had a moratorium,

172
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:48,476
proposal that passed and it went from January of 2016 to December of 2017.

173
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:50,137
Now incorporated into that

174
00:17:56,522 --> 00:18:06,769
was the density of the immediate neighborhood taken into consideration, the height, the number of units, as well as the zoning exemptions that were being challenged.

175
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:21,040
And as a result of that, they have now, I think if you go to them all, then you can be able to see, if you look at their development office, I don't know if they call it Office of Community Development, they do have a serious situation where they had developers just coming in all over the place.

176
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:29,709
Medford has a serious problem in having a workable business community, a business development community.

177
00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:34,591
Approximately 10.2% of the business in this community is commercial.

178
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:36,552
Who bears the rest of that brunt?

179
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:38,093
It's the residential.

180
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:47,578
And I know every time when you folks turn around and do your budget, you talk about a residential factor making it the highest or the lowest or whatever it might be, you're still putting the burden

181
00:18:47,998 --> 00:18:53,160
on the taxpayer who owns his residential home, and you're not taking the exemption for the out-of-state person.

182
00:18:53,761 --> 00:19:07,507
So, with that being said, and if we continue to go on this road, or this, how can you say, this road, so to speak, of not increasing our commercial base, all you're going to do is just going to be commercial, I mean, raising in the future your residential rate.

183
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:16,051
Now, after what took place in Malden, and after what took place after that, we can switch ourselves over to the city of,

184
00:19:16,636 --> 00:19:19,008
Mr. Patrick, you have one minute remaining.

185
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,476
Just want to let you know.

186
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:21,942
You want somebody else to talk?

187
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:22,843
No, you have 10 minutes.

188
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:24,604
Your 10 minutes is just about up.

189
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:26,505
OK, well, I'm on my last page.

190
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:27,466
I'm on my last page.

191
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:27,907
Yep, no problem.

192
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:28,487
Thank you.

193
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:39,416
So after Malden, beside Malden, in 2015, the city of Revere, and again in 2018, put that question of a moratorium, high density, multi-use positions over there.

194
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:47,402
And their situation over there revolved itself around large scale buildings, traffic, public safety, schools, and roads were going to be at issue.

195
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:59,428
And the claims that Revere was not growing geographically, but rather becoming more dense without any economic development is just like what's going on right here in our city of Medford.

196
00:20:00,088 --> 00:20:04,750
And with that being said, that the challenge for affordable housing in Chapter 40B as we speak today,

197
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:14,056
would be the luxury of using our at-present zoning laws and skirt around the real issue of reasonably priced housing and rental.

198
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:20,780
There are two or three companies in the United States that take into effect low-moderate housing.

199
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:21,841
Veterans

200
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:29,542
middle-income people, but not high-end middle-income people, middle-income people, and that's a determination by a professional.

201
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:52,578
We don't have that expertise over here, and I know on the ballot here tonight, on our agenda, there's a question regarding Chapter 40B, but if you really look at just Chapter 40B, and you realize that developer is not there to lose money, and he's putting housing in a densely populated area, you're violating all the reasoning of why a neighborhood should be a neighborhood.

202
00:20:53,438 --> 00:20:57,101
And as a result of that, moratoriums does not have to go on the ballot.

203
00:20:57,602 --> 00:21:01,985
A moratorium can be placed by this council, by this mayor, or jointly together.

204
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:09,592
And recognizing the fact, and recognizing the fact, we are a city just as running, allowing housing to be any place and everywhere at any time.

205
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:11,834
And because of that, that's not good.

206
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:13,475
That's not healthy for the neighborhood.

207
00:21:14,136 --> 00:21:18,920
As I said before a long time ago, development for the sake of development isn't the best thing that can happen in this city.

208
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,262
We have schools, we have public safety, we have public works.

209
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:26,705
We have a whole host of issues that taxpayers have to increasingly pay for.

210
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:33,889
And our best example of that is when they talked about stations landing, that they said at that point in time, that was going to lower our tax rate.

211
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:37,171
Well, the tax rate has never gone down once since station landing.

212
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:39,513
As a matter of fact, it just continuously goes up.

213
00:21:40,794 --> 00:21:57,560
I'd be more than happy to answer any questions, but I just think it's important to have brought this up, especially for our two new councils, but more importantly for all seven of you, because this administration and you as a new council needs to address issues that basically address these matters.

214
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:07,063
They haven't been addressed, and they need to be addressed, and you just can't sit here and say, okay, we'll get to it someday, because someday has already come.

215
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:09,724
So with that being said, Mr. President,

216
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:19,790
Larry, could you, I made copies of my comments for all of your counselors, so in case you missed anything.

217
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:30,332
The part that I appreciated the most when I served on this board for 36 years was the fact that I was willing to hear opposite viewpoints.

218
00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:34,814
But when it comes to finances, two and two equals four.

219
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:39,596
And when it comes to neighborhoods, the people who live in the neighborhood should come first.

220
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:45,618
Not out-of-towners, not developers who want to come in there and make a whole bunch of money and then leave us.

221
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,859
Perfect example is Lumineer on Locust Street.

222
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:49,980
They built the building.

223
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,921
They said they were going to stay there.

224
00:22:52,201 --> 00:22:54,162
They went to the Board of Appeals to get what they had to.

225
00:22:54,762 --> 00:23:02,027
And one year later, they sold off the building and made $62 million at the expense of the Medford taxpayer.

226
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:04,808
So with that being said, Mr. President, I thank you for listening.

227
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:07,470
And if there's any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them.

228
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,570
Thank you, Mr. Penta.

229
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:10,792
Any questions from the council?

230
00:23:13,453 --> 00:23:13,833
Any questions?

231
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,535
Can I ask a question?

232
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:19,637
That guy there looks like Ted Cruz.

233
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,561
He's got a new addition.

234
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,083
Thank you, Mr. Penta.

235
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:31,464
If we could please have your name and address for the record, please.

236
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,744
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

237
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:37,606
My name is John Starella, and I reside on Metcalfe Street here in Medford.

238
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:44,289
I just want to give you my idea of what Councilor Penta referred to free cash.

239
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:51,151
And I want to give you my idea of what free cash is, and I'd like to know whether or not you agree with me.

240
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:53,792
I see free cash as a slush fund.

241
00:23:54,592 --> 00:24:00,394
I mean, when we pass, say, for instance, an expenditure, we always overestimate it.

242
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:09,376
And that's done intentionally, because what is left over from the overestimate is put into free cash.

243
00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:11,577
And that sits there.

244
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:14,058
And when...

245
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:22,091
the council or any councilor needs a special project, we pay for it out of free cash.

246
00:24:23,372 --> 00:24:26,794
And it passes easily because it's free.

247
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:31,437
What do you think of that, Mr. President?

248
00:24:32,157 --> 00:24:33,378
What do you think of that?

249
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:35,719
I think the name is horrible that they call it free cash.

250
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:36,940
Nothing's free.

251
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,582
I mean, I disagree with the name of it, without a doubt.

252
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:44,044
But is that the purpose of free cash, to have a slush fund?

253
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:46,495
I wouldn't think so, no.

254
00:24:47,255 --> 00:24:47,435
So.

255
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:52,296
Well, that's where you get your money when you have a project later on in the term.

256
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:56,937
You can take it right out of free cash and no one objects to it because it's free.

257
00:24:58,657 --> 00:24:59,318
Quote, unquote.

258
00:25:00,218 --> 00:25:00,538
Thank you.

259
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:01,498
Thank you, Mr. President.

260
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:02,118
Thank you.

261
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:06,679
Any other questions?

262
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,180
Okay.

263
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:18,980
restricted available funds used to supplement the budget.

264
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:21,862
By definition that's what it is.

265
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:24,383
Correct.

266
00:25:24,663 --> 00:25:25,784
Motion to receive and place on file.

267
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:29,807
On the motion of council tonight, seconded by councilor Scott Pelley to receive and place on file.

268
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:30,467
All those in favor?

269
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:31,708
All those opposed?

270
00:25:31,748 --> 00:25:33,489
The paper is received and placed on file.

271
00:25:34,142 --> 00:25:52,036
Motion to console Scott Kelly to revert to the regular order of business second by console beers all those in favor all those opposed the motion passes to 0-0 for to offer by console morale whereas the city city of Medford currently Exercises the local option for tax deferments in accordance with Mass General Law chapter 59 chapter

272
00:25:53,677 --> 00:26:02,720
5 paragraph 41 A and whereas the upper income limit set by the city of Medford for eligible residents 65 and over is $20,000 per year.

273
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:09,863
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss raising the income limit to better reflect the cost of living and housing in Medford.

274
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:15,465
Councilor Morrell.

275
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:17,184
Thank you, Mr. President.

276
00:26:17,424 --> 00:26:18,345
So I do apologize.

277
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:20,287
So the current minimum for Medford is actually $40,000.

278
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:21,909
In a last session, this body

279
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:54,673
Adjusted the interest rate and also at some point that cap was adjusted I found some pages on the website that need to be updated with the current cap But even at that level of $40,000 for the income cap Medford still lags behind surrounding cities in this state program So for people that don't know this is a state program that Medford takes part in that allows residents who meet certain criteria And are over the age of 65 to defer their property taxes until their house is sold or they pass away

280
00:26:56,283 --> 00:27:22,178
Medford like every other municipality has to set an income cap on this and an interest rate as I said The interest rate was lower to 5% last session and I think the members of this body who helped to pass that But in regards to the income cap at $40,000 For context Somerville's limit is 57,000 Cambridge is 53,000 and it should be noted that both of these communities have owner occupied exemptions, which we do not have in Medford, so I

281
00:27:22,702 --> 00:27:30,424
As far as kind of tools in our tools box to help people who need it to get relief from their property taxes were really limited.

282
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:39,326
So I think it's important that we make sure we're at the highest level allowed by the state so that as many people who do wish to take part in this program can.

283
00:27:39,486 --> 00:27:42,607
I think I check with the chief assessor the city assessor.

284
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:45,408
Believe only two households currently take part in the program.

285
00:27:45,448 --> 00:28:10,113
So I understand it's not for everyone with the interest rates and the way the interest rate actually Changes at the time of the owner passing away or being sold But the state does allow us to raise this cap to the senior circuit breaker tax credit And I do understand that other communities rather than having to come back to this income cap time and again They're wording it such that this program is

286
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:18,658
in their city is for people who meet the requirements with income not exceeding the state cap calculated under Clause 41A of Section 5 of Chapter 59.

287
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:23,388
So that's something that as the state adjusts, Medford would adjust along with it.

288
00:28:24,348 --> 00:28:48,966
So I'm raising this now and my motion is to send this to Committee of the Whole in either February or March so it's something that we can have the city assessor come out and explain to us how this program, if more people were to take part in this at this higher income cap or other potential caps, how it would just affect cash flow so that we can look at that during budget time as we have these,

289
00:28:49,693 --> 00:29:01,242
Meetings hopefully earlier, as we discussed already in this meeting, and I'd also like to add a beat paper so that when that rate is set, this does go up as a notice in the next property tax bill.

290
00:29:02,483 --> 00:29:07,927
The deadline to apply for this program is April 1st, so it would be hard for this.

291
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:10,509
We can't do it this time around, but knowing when this rate is set.

292
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:17,090
just so people are aware of this program because it is a program from the state that people around the state take part in.

293
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,932
And I want to make sure that Medford residents do know about it.

294
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:23,234
So thank you.

295
00:29:23,915 --> 00:29:28,118
If you could, um, if you could just help with the clerk, if you could give him the wording to the B paper.

296
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:29,139
Yep.

297
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,201
Um, so when this, when we set or

298
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:45,763
Whether we stay with the current cap, if we pick a new cap, whatever it is, after we have this committee of the whole, that we include a notice of this program the next time property tax bills are sent out.

299
00:29:57,751 --> 00:29:57,992
Thank you.

300
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:03,813
Would you like to make a comment?

301
00:30:03,853 --> 00:30:05,174
Name and address for the record, please.

302
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:10,417
Yeah, William Navar, Apartment 1B, Medford Street.

303
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:14,260
Sorry, 108 Medford Street, Apartment 1B.

304
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:20,684
I wanted to speak a little bit about this and how it relates to the philosophy of taxation.

305
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:27,369
I wanted to say that land is opportunity and taxes on land are therefore taxes on opportunity.

306
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:36,733
But unlike most taxes, which are only paid when the opportunity is exploited, taxes on land are paid whether the opportunities are squandered or exploited.

307
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:46,380
Taxes on land, therefore, discourage folks buying up land in order to charge a high price to future folks wanting to access the opportunities available on it.

308
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:57,848
Real estate taxes are the only tax I know of in the Commonwealth that tax land at all, and they are therefore the best type of tax collected in this Commonwealth.

309
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:07,712
But those who support taxes on land have, for over 100 years, been thought to be on a mission to tax elderly widows out of their homes.

310
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,756
In 1909, Winston Churchill had already heard it a million times.

311
00:31:11,397 --> 00:31:16,184
You might not be aware that Winston Churchill supported the form of taxation I've been advocating to you guys.

312
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:23,126
He said then that the personality of the widow has been used to exhaustion.

313
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:30,914
It would be sweating in the cruelest sense of the word, over time of the grossest description, to bring the widow out again so soon.

314
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:32,976
She must have a rest for a bit.

315
00:31:34,698 --> 00:31:39,603
Therefore, since I'm advocating for that form of text, I feel this is a really good opportunity

316
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:46,980
to rise in support of the deferral programs in the strongest possible terms and support increasing its income limits.

317
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:54,973
This proposal will allow our seniors to age in place and enjoy their homes if that's what they choose, not tax widows out of their homes.

318
00:31:56,684 --> 00:32:01,008
And this I should make very clear I understand is not a handout of any kind to our seniors.

319
00:32:01,268 --> 00:32:04,110
It is not even a social safety net or a form of charity.

320
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:12,578
Seniors are still well incentivized to downsize their land use if they wish to leave a larger estate to their heirs.

321
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:24,208
The tax deferrals merely give seniors more flexibility on how to use the assets that they have worked hard to build up over the years by paying their taxes deferred with their property.

322
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:38,561
I hope the seniors who are able to remain in our community under the deferment program will remain allies in my calls for more intensive land use that will provide access to urban opportunities for people of all ages as our city grows.

323
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:46,783
I hope they'll support my calls for higher taxes on land and lower taxes on buildings, and that they'll support my calls for fewer parking mandates.

324
00:32:47,283 --> 00:32:53,984
I want to reiterate, in the strongest possible terms, that I support tax deferral programs and I do not hope for increased

325
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:57,665
land taxes or real estate taxes to tax anyone out of their homes.

326
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,085
Thank you.

327
00:32:58,706 --> 00:32:59,006
Thank you.

328
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:00,746
Counselor beers.

329
00:33:02,287 --> 00:33:03,207
Thank you, Mr. President.

330
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:17,193
I don't know, possible and also making sure that with only two households using this, I mean, that might be that people don't want to.

331
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:21,074
My people be that people don't know that the cap was raised to 40,000 recently.

332
00:33:21,114 --> 00:33:23,215
I think there's a lot of information questions there.

333
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:23,435
So

334
00:33:24,413 --> 00:33:26,994
I just strongly support this motion and the B paper.

335
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:28,875
Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

336
00:33:29,095 --> 00:33:29,655
Councilor Knight.

337
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:31,336
Mr. President, thank you very much.

338
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:47,062
Last term when this council did adopt the increase from $20,000 to $40,000, which passed unanimously before the body, we raised a question to the city assessor asking her to conduct a cost analysis and feasibility study of adopting the state maximum.

339
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:52,764
She reported back to us, I believe, right around the time we were setting the tax rate.

340
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:54,979
that she was still working on that document.

341
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:07,711
So I'd just like to add the paper that the council had adopted back in March of 2019, I'm sorry, May of 2019, I believe it was either the 20th or the 28th in that meeting, making that request.

342
00:34:08,192 --> 00:34:17,781
And add that to the agenda as part of the discussion, Mr. President, because if we're going to make a decision about this type of issue that's going to have a certain impact on our finances here in the community,

343
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:26,483
then at the very least we need to have a feasibility study or a cost impact analysis done so that we have an understanding of what impact it's going to have on the bottom line in the community.

344
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:27,263
Correct.

345
00:34:27,723 --> 00:34:28,484
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

346
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:30,404
So my motion would be to join that paper.

347
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:31,705
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

348
00:34:33,285 --> 00:34:33,785
You want to join?

349
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:35,206
To include it as part of the meeting.

350
00:34:35,386 --> 00:34:43,229
It doesn't necessarily have to be joined to this paper tonight, but when the meeting is conducted, that it's conducted when we have the cost analysis and feasibility study.

351
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:43,749
Yes, okay.

352
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,121
Thank you very much.

353
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:46,282
Councilor Marks.

354
00:34:47,223 --> 00:34:48,043
Thank you Mr. President.

355
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:50,306
I want to thank Councilor Morrell for bringing this up.

356
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:59,134
I remember last year's discussions and at the time I believe it was two or three people that took advantage of the tax deferral program.

357
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:15,492
And at the time when we were discussing of raising the income levels and also lowering the interest rate, we thought by taking a step by lowering it from 8% to 5%, we'd see if we attracted more people.

358
00:35:15,793 --> 00:35:20,454
Was that more attractive to people that possibly wanted to do a deferral?

359
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:25,496
And I think it's too soon to tell now, but over the next several months,

360
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:28,577
We should see if that was somewhat successful.

361
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:33,839
And I agree the next logical step is increasing the income levels.

362
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,180
So I agree with that.

363
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,523
I also want to put out there that this is one of several programs that seniors could take advantage of.

364
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:48,238
The other program that we have is the state circuit breaker tax credit program.

365
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,340
And that's been around for a number of years.

366
00:35:50,921 --> 00:35:53,443
It's 100% through the state.

367
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,865
So it's not a city run program.

368
00:35:56,686 --> 00:36:05,093
And based on how it works is when your tax bill exceeds 10% of your total income, you qualify.

369
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:11,207
So it's 10% of your total income, you qualify this for this particular program.

370
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:17,011
And for the tax year 2019, the amount that you would qualify for is $1,130.

371
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:18,012
So if any senior out there,

372
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:27,297
is interested, you have to apply for it when you do your taxes, which are coming up.

373
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:29,037
This is an ideal time to do it.

374
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:32,538
And that's when you would apply for this through the state.

375
00:36:32,998 --> 00:36:34,859
And you would have to follow their rules and regulations.

376
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:42,541
But that more or less is, in a nutshell, how do you apply for it and who's eligible.

377
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:51,524
The other one is the regular statutory exemptions that we have currently in this city right now for, I believe, veterans, disabled, the blind,

378
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:53,453
and also seniors.

379
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:54,515
And there may be another one.

380
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:56,879
I think there may be five or six exemptions.

381
00:36:57,503 --> 00:37:10,868
And the one that I'm speaking about, Mr. President, this council back many years ago, through my resolution, lowered the age from 70 to 65, which actually helped thousands of people take advantage of it, that five-year gap.

382
00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:16,190
And that's something I'm proud of that we did many, many years ago to help seniors in this community.

383
00:37:17,031 --> 00:37:21,092
But the senior exemption, Mr. President, and this is something we have to look up.

384
00:37:21,192 --> 00:37:22,673
It's set up statutorily.

385
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:36,193
So we can't raise the income levels, but we can ask our state delegation, which we ask a lot of things, if they would look at it on a state level, Mr. President, because depending on where you live,

386
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,341
in Massachusetts, these income levels are way out of whack.

387
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:50,944
So for instance, your income to be eligible for the senior statutory property tax exemption is not to exceed $24,758 if you're single or $37,137 if you're married.

388
00:38:01,035 --> 00:38:08,282
So those are the two income levels that you can't exceed to be currently eligible for a $1,000 exemption in the city of Meffitt.

389
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:18,109
The one nice thing about this program is we get paid for a portion of what we give in exemption back by the state through our cherry sheets.

390
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,431
So we actually get something in back.

391
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:23,452
So actually, we should be promoting this for our seniors.

392
00:38:24,013 --> 00:38:27,435
They're getting $1,000, and we're also getting somewhat reimbursed.

393
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:31,257
So we're not fully losing out the $1,000 on our tax roll.

394
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:35,780
So it's a win-win for the resident and also for the city, Mr. President.

395
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,262
And also, there's the income level I just mentioned.

396
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:53,609
And regarding estates, you cannot exceed, if you're single, $40,000 in estate revenue or worth and $55,000 for married.

397
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:56,310
And this does not count your domicile.

398
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,851
So it does not count where you live.

399
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:03,134
So if you have other assets and so forth that are above the $40,000 for single and $55,000, that's also another criteria.

400
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:17,246
But this program, I believe hundreds of Meffitt residents, I can't remember the last count, take advantage of this program every year, Mr. President, and count on it because of the way taxes are going up.

401
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,427
But as I mentioned at the beginning, $24,000.

402
00:39:19,587 --> 00:39:28,050
If someone's making $24,000 and they want to rent in the city of Meffitt, you wouldn't be renting in the city of Meffitt.

403
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,552
You wouldn't be able to afford anything else but possibly your rent.

404
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:35,022
So these numbers are way out of whack.

405
00:39:35,062 --> 00:39:41,786
Maybe if you're living out in Fall River or maybe in Springfield, that may swing it for a single person out there.

406
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:42,526
Who knows?

407
00:39:42,586 --> 00:39:43,087
Maybe not.

408
00:39:43,827 --> 00:39:45,728
But around here, it doesn't, Mr. President.

409
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:53,893
And I would ask that we as a council, because this has been an issue for years, and it does go up incrementally every year.

410
00:39:54,753 --> 00:40:00,115
So it went up from last year, it was 24,000, it might have been 24,100 rather than 24,700.

411
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:18,403
So it does go up a certain percentage every year, but it's not enough to be eligible to the masses, which I think in this day and age we all want to get to because many seniors like my mother and many other mothers in here, they may be property rich, but they're money poor.

412
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:22,171
They don't have the fluidity of having money.

413
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:29,977
They have a house that's worth something they bought years and years ago, but they don't have the cash to pay for the taxes and everything else that goes up.

414
00:40:30,237 --> 00:40:33,080
The cable bill and you name it, everything goes up every year.

415
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:41,846
So these are important things that seniors that are low income, seniors in our community need to take advantage.

416
00:40:42,187 --> 00:40:48,732
And if we can do anything, like Councilor Morrell mentioned, about increasing the income and asset levels,

417
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:50,853
I think we should be promoting that.

418
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:52,314
So I want to thank the Council.

419
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:53,935
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

420
00:40:58,878 --> 00:41:00,879
Please have your name and address for the record, please.

421
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:03,220
John Stirella of Metcalfe Street.

422
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:05,001
Thank you, Mr. President.

423
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:12,525
And I want to tell Councilor Morrell that I do support your resolution.

424
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:18,409
But I would like, if you can, to quantify it for me.

425
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:21,955
as it stands today.

426
00:41:22,455 --> 00:41:26,117
I mean, as it's practiced today, can you quantify it?

427
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,239
What is it costing?

428
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:37,445
In other words, well, I've heard that only six people are in the program.

429
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:38,425
Is that true?

430
00:41:38,906 --> 00:41:43,809
I heard, the number I got from the assessor this week was two households.

431
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:44,929
Two.

432
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:45,730
I beg your pardon?

433
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,030
Two.

434
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:46,210
Two.

435
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,211
There are only two people in the program?

436
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:48,992
Two households, yeah.

437
00:41:50,353 --> 00:41:52,454
Well, what are we talking about here?

438
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:58,017
I mean, the average tax, say, is $6,000 a year.

439
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:03,260
Now, as I understand, this counts somewhere else as a deferment, right?

440
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,802
Now, deferment means you pay nothing, right?

441
00:42:06,822 --> 00:42:08,263
It defers the whole cost.

442
00:42:08,323 --> 00:42:08,503
Yes.

443
00:42:09,724 --> 00:42:11,745
Well, this comes only to, say, $6,000, $6,000 on an average.

444
00:42:11,765 --> 00:42:13,125
$12,000 is what we're talking about.

445
00:42:18,164 --> 00:42:32,647
Now, when you shift that, say, for instance, to the rest of the population, pardon me, when you shift that to the rest of the population, there are 17,000 parcels.

446
00:42:34,528 --> 00:42:45,490
You divide the 17,000 into the 12,000, and you get the added cost to the rest of the population of something like a dollar a year.

447
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:47,903
This is ridiculous.

448
00:42:47,963 --> 00:42:53,227
We're talking about a dollar a year to 17,000 people in the city.

449
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:55,328
They'll gladly pay it.

450
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:58,390
But this amounts to nothing.

451
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,373
Actually, when you consider that we have a $183 million budget, right?

452
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:03,694
But we don't spend $183 million, do we?

453
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:15,520
No, we spend more.

454
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,281
We spend something like $200 million, and we do that every year.

455
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:28,464
So I don't know why this subject is even brought up, because it amounts to nothing, nothing at all.

456
00:43:30,185 --> 00:43:31,425
I would like to see it improved.

457
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,246
Point of information, Consular Marks.

458
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,382
I can hear what Dr. Streller is mentioning.

459
00:43:38,422 --> 00:43:55,353
At this point, because there's only two households taking advantage of this, what we're trying to do, doctor, is increase the number of participants by lowering the interest rate from 8% to 5%, making it more attractive, by increasing the income levels to make it more attractive.

460
00:43:55,913 --> 00:44:00,216
And by the way, that dollar a piece that you're talking about,

461
00:44:01,417 --> 00:44:07,562
has to be realized every year, but we're also getting an interest off this.

462
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:19,473
So the people that are doing the deferment, if you have roughly an $8,000 tax rate, you're going to be paying $400 eventually when you settle up on that every year.

463
00:44:21,474 --> 00:44:23,876
So really, it's going to come back.

464
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:32,313
It's not really paid out by the people that aren't taking the deferment because we're gonna get it back through the deferral.

465
00:44:33,134 --> 00:44:35,675
But what we're trying to do is increase the number of people.

466
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:40,176
So right now, you're right, it's marginal because there's only two people taking advantage.

467
00:44:40,476 --> 00:44:42,657
But that's not the intent, to keep it marginal.

468
00:44:42,897 --> 00:44:47,038
It is, but even if you increase it by 100%, now you'll have four people on it.

469
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:51,140
I mean, this is a ridiculous discussion.

470
00:44:52,168 --> 00:44:53,729
So let's dispense with it.

471
00:44:54,630 --> 00:45:14,802
But I do agree with you that, when you gave your example about senior citizens who are house rich but dollar poor, well, that's the reason I think that this council must definitely put in a tax reduction this year.

472
00:45:16,223 --> 00:45:18,504
Now our tax comes to,

473
00:45:22,045 --> 00:45:28,468
My God, my mind is... What is our tax now?

474
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:29,709
It's... 9.15.

475
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:35,292
Yeah, well, that's the rate.

476
00:45:35,312 --> 00:45:37,613
But I was thinking that the tax should be reduced from...

477
00:45:53,062 --> 00:45:53,863
Oh my God.

478
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,285
You see what you guys got to look forward to?

479
00:46:01,487 --> 00:46:02,128
But anyway.

480
00:46:03,115 --> 00:46:09,981
Our tax should be reduced, I say, to 14, like we're paying now $18,000.

481
00:46:10,742 --> 00:46:13,484
It should be reduced to $14,000.

482
00:46:14,244 --> 00:46:17,928
And not only that, if we reduce the taxes, now you must consider this.

483
00:46:18,188 --> 00:46:21,290
This is very important because you've got to do this before June 30th.

484
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:23,572
Now, we know what's going to happen.

485
00:46:23,592 --> 00:46:26,034
You're going to be presented with a tax.

486
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:29,481
On June 29th, you've got to pass it in a hurry.

487
00:46:29,922 --> 00:46:34,566
You're not going to consider the only power you have, which is to reduce taxes.

488
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,847
But that's what you must do.

489
00:46:36,747 --> 00:46:41,291
Because reducing taxes will increase revenue.

490
00:46:41,812 --> 00:46:43,333
Now, that sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

491
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:47,817
But that's what the federal government did, right?

492
00:46:48,778 --> 00:46:51,160
The federal government reduced taxes, right?

493
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,181
And guess what?

494
00:46:52,611 --> 00:46:55,552
revenue increase because other taxes are paid.

495
00:46:56,172 --> 00:46:58,814
When consumers have more money, they spend more money.

496
00:46:58,854 --> 00:47:03,535
When they spend more money, that increases other taxes, and that's what will happen to us.

497
00:47:04,336 --> 00:47:09,498
So we've got to reduce taxes, and that's the way we'll help people like your mother.

498
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:13,079
If you reduce taxes.

499
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:22,063
Now, this tax reduction is so successful that within the next 90 days, the president is considering reducing federal taxes again.

500
00:47:24,264 --> 00:47:25,985
He expects to get more revenue from that.

501
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:32,690
So, I hope you consider this very, very carefully.

502
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:36,053
You must not, again, increase taxes.

503
00:47:36,593 --> 00:47:43,458
Because when you look at this agenda here, practically every one of these resolutions is a tax increase.

504
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:49,603
Like, for instance, I was talking to one of the councilors here about these bins.

505
00:47:51,152 --> 00:47:54,493
Well, what he wants to do, he wants to charge a fee for having a bin.

506
00:47:55,713 --> 00:47:56,833
That fee is a tax.

507
00:47:57,093 --> 00:47:57,874
Here we go again.

508
00:47:58,394 --> 00:48:01,014
And that tax translates into revenue.

509
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:04,295
And the council loves the revenue.

510
00:48:05,395 --> 00:48:16,578
Because the revenue is how we pay all of the 80%, by the way, 80% of our revenue is spent on compensation.

511
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,579
The whole thing has to be reconsidered.

512
00:48:21,939 --> 00:48:30,445
But, believe it or not, as ironic as it sounds, a tax reduction will help the people of Medford.

513
00:48:31,105 --> 00:48:35,248
The people of Medford who we all want to serve, right?

514
00:48:36,108 --> 00:48:37,689
And many of us would do it for nothing.

515
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:40,071
We'd be happy to do it for nothing.

516
00:48:41,091 --> 00:48:41,652
And we do it.

517
00:48:42,192 --> 00:48:43,033
Many of us do that.

518
00:48:44,273 --> 00:48:45,454
We give to the people.

519
00:48:47,015 --> 00:48:48,376
We don't expect compensation.

520
00:48:49,195 --> 00:48:49,835
We don't want them.

521
00:48:50,936 --> 00:48:53,617
And many people have served.

522
00:48:53,757 --> 00:48:55,978
Many people have put their lives at risk.

523
00:48:57,618 --> 00:49:04,641
Who would put his life at risk and then not even get paid adequately for it?

524
00:49:06,962 --> 00:49:11,144
I remember when I was in the service, I was paid $80 as an ensign.

525
00:49:11,164 --> 00:49:11,564
And that $80,

526
00:49:18,891 --> 00:49:20,391
was not every week.

527
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:22,812
It was every two weeks.

528
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:25,333
So I was getting $160 a month.

529
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:26,953
I was happy to get it.

530
00:49:27,753 --> 00:49:28,113
Thank you.

531
00:49:30,154 --> 00:49:30,474
Thank you.

532
00:49:31,014 --> 00:49:32,254
Name and address for the record, please.

533
00:49:37,576 --> 00:49:41,557
Andrew Castaneda, Cushman Street, East Medford, Massachusetts.

534
00:49:42,517 --> 00:49:45,698
Not to put words in my friend, Dr. Starella,

535
00:49:47,236 --> 00:49:57,181
in his repertoire of words, but I think he's implying if you walk the streets, we'll tax your feet, because I'm the tax man, quote the Beatles.

536
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:12,628
First of all, I want to thank Councilor Morrell, Councilor Marks, and others, and ex-Councilor Pinto for bringing up this housing and affordability situation the way I'm comprehending it.

537
00:50:13,331 --> 00:50:20,994
And Councilor Marks brought up a good point that I found out about 20 years ago when my mother was doing income taxes.

538
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:26,956
And he brought up, I believe it's actually called a circuit breaker under the Massachusetts income tax.

539
00:50:28,096 --> 00:50:31,437
And a lot of people don't know about this.

540
00:50:32,337 --> 00:50:36,959
And believe it or not, some accountants that do taxes don't know about it also.

541
00:50:37,819 --> 00:50:40,300
Scary thought, but I've caught a few of them.

542
00:50:42,649 --> 00:51:05,892
I believe the formula is, on a Massachusetts return, they take your real estate tax and your water bill, or a portion thereof, and they take 10% of your adjusted gross income, and then they do the mathematics, and if you're above, in other words, you're hurting, you would get dollar for dollar, mind you.

543
00:51:06,713 --> 00:51:10,355
up to the max of, like you said, about $1,100, I guess it is.

544
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:12,877
Haven't looked at it since my mother's been gone for years.

545
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:14,958
But thank you for bringing that up.

546
00:51:15,058 --> 00:51:32,348
Also, what you failed to mention was, it not only applies to people who pay real estate taxes in houses that they live in, it also applies to renters, which I was surprised to read in the law, unless the law has changed since 12 years ago.

547
00:51:34,278 --> 00:51:55,674
However, in Andrew's gut opinion, there's only one surefire way to help the owner-occupied people that live in their houses in Medford is to adopt the Commonwealth of Massachusetts owner-occupied real estate tax exemption.

548
00:51:56,355 --> 00:52:01,899
And it's called, if you want to look it up, Chapter 59, Section 5C.

549
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,801
And in my estimation,

550
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:14,676
The average owner, average I'm saying, would save about $2,000 a year off their real estate tax bill.

551
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:17,558
I've been asking for nine and a half years.

552
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,221
It will be done someday.

553
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:21,422
I may not see it.

554
00:52:22,943 --> 00:52:25,305
And if it's done, it's in perpetuity.

555
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:30,770
Name and address of the record.

556
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:34,847
William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

557
00:52:36,308 --> 00:52:41,811
I heard some mention of the Laffer curve, which is the name of the curve that you can reduce the tax rate.

558
00:52:41,831 --> 00:52:45,153
You'll have more economic activity going on, and then your revenue will go up.

559
00:52:45,193 --> 00:52:46,313
That's called the Laffer curve.

560
00:52:46,353 --> 00:52:49,275
It was put forth during the Reagan administration.

561
00:52:49,315 --> 00:52:55,559
And there's been some debate on whether or not it's true in the federal tax regime that we have.

562
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:58,640
And so the economists go back and forth on that.

563
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:06,921
But I could probably invite the council to guess one area where we're very certain the Laffer curve does not apply.

564
00:53:06,941 --> 00:53:10,004
And that would be land.

565
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:15,528
Will Rogers said, buy land, they ain't making any more of it.

566
00:53:16,469 --> 00:53:21,474
Well, the fact is, if you raise the tax on land, nobody's going to destroy it either in order to avoid having to pay the tax.

567
00:53:22,363 --> 00:53:27,864
You have a nice building, somebody jacks up the tax rate, maybe you'll pull the building down, you won't have to pay the tax no more.

568
00:53:27,884 --> 00:53:29,065
You can't pull land down.

569
00:53:29,705 --> 00:53:31,365
You can't build land, you can't create it.

570
00:53:31,405 --> 00:53:34,466
It's impossible for the owner to create or destroy to affect the amount they're paying.

571
00:53:34,486 --> 00:53:38,927
So if you shift the tax to land, it'd be very similar to that.

572
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:41,488
People make the place better, they'll build more buildings.

573
00:53:43,108 --> 00:53:46,329
Medford will be a better place to live, the land will become more valuable, you can tax it more.

574
00:53:47,678 --> 00:53:52,462
The Laffer Curve cannot possibly apply to land, because it's perfectly inelastic good.

575
00:53:53,783 --> 00:53:56,746
It cannot be created or destroyed by us mere mortals.

576
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:59,969
It was created by nature, and we're kind of stuck with the amount we have.

577
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:02,631
So that's one reason you should tax land.

578
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:03,572
No Laffer Curve.

579
00:54:03,712 --> 00:54:03,952
Thanks.

580
00:54:04,332 --> 00:54:04,652
Thank you.

581
00:54:08,956 --> 00:54:10,858
Name and address for the record.

582
00:54:10,898 --> 00:54:11,939
Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

583
00:54:14,997 --> 00:54:21,759
I'm going to give you guys an analogy, and I think this is a great idea, but it's the equivalent of putting a bucket under a flood.

584
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:30,623
When you have a deluge of water, you want to turn off the source or turn down the source to help alleviate what the issue is.

585
00:54:31,638 --> 00:54:37,943
We continue to look at, and it's admirable for the short term, but it doesn't resolve the issue for the long term.

586
00:54:38,003 --> 00:54:40,986
And what it does is turn our government into a bank.

587
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:53,496
So we're saying to people, if you owe money and you can't pay it, we'll alleviate that debt temporarily by way of deferment and charge you 5% interest or 8% interest.

588
00:54:53,576 --> 00:54:56,278
And so now we're a bank as well.

589
00:54:56,698 --> 00:54:58,500
If we look at how

590
00:54:59,153 --> 00:55:13,926
we are planning our city and assure that we are doing things to increase our commercial tax base, what we are doing is creating new revenues of income stream so that we don't have to continue to increase real estate.

591
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:36,427
And I strongly object to the idea that we should tax land so that it's more valuable, because increasing the value of real estate is everything that is wrong with the housing market and is the core problem of why housing is so unaffordable, because it's become an investment opportunity and ceased to be a place where people live.

592
00:55:37,148 --> 00:55:52,644
If you look back in years past, when real estate was divided between commercial, which was investment opportunity, and residential, which was a place where you lived, housing was not inflated the way it is now.

593
00:55:53,044 --> 00:55:58,509
So I would caution you that when we talk about these academic things, you should look at how

594
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,871
things have come to pass.

595
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:20,901
And inflating the cost of land does nothing to help keep elderly people in their home or marginalized people in their home or allow for opportunities to people to be able to afford a piece of property or an apartment or a condo if they so choose to purchase into that American dream.

596
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:23,022
So with that said, I would

597
00:56:24,162 --> 00:56:40,993
You know, laud the fact that we're looking at these things, but we really should be thinking about the source too, and it starts with really good and solid urban planning that takes into consideration those multiple avenues that afford us the opportunity to balance for our residents their real estate tax.

598
00:56:41,433 --> 00:56:41,754
Thank you.

599
00:56:42,154 --> 00:56:42,514
Thank you.

600
00:56:45,036 --> 00:56:45,596
I'm gonna be quick.

601
00:56:46,176 --> 00:56:46,937
Please.

602
00:56:47,257 --> 00:56:49,178
108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

603
00:56:51,314 --> 00:56:54,197
I wanted to clarify, because that was a great point.

604
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:55,478
I'm really excited to hear it.

605
00:56:56,999 --> 00:57:13,153
There's a slight difference when we talk about land between price and value, because the price of a land is the, we want that to be low, because the price represents the,

606
00:57:15,356 --> 00:57:26,563
sorry, capitalized value of the residual, that is the rent of the land minus the tax, gets capitalized into a price, all right?

607
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:38,950
So the price of the land refers to that, the value of land actually refers to the rent of the land, and that is the difference, how productive the land is, how useful it is, how much of a blessing it is to whoever gets to occupy it.

608
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:50,119
That's different from the price of the lead, which represents the value that if you were to sell it today, sell the right to that lead into perpetuity.

609
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,080
That's the piece you're investing on.

610
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,821
And actually, I totally agree.

611
00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:59,229
You do not want to increase the price of the land.

612
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:07,951
Increasing the sale price of the land is the exact opposite of what a land value tax does, and is the exact opposite of what real estate taxes do.

613
00:58:07,971 --> 00:58:08,391
We know that.

614
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:12,992
If you raise any of the taxes on the real estate, on the land, whatever, the price goes down.

615
00:58:13,392 --> 00:58:14,552
We want the price to go down.

616
00:58:14,572 --> 00:58:17,973
That's distinct from what we mean when we say the value goes up.

617
00:58:18,193 --> 00:58:19,473
Those are two different ideas.

618
00:58:19,493 --> 00:58:20,893
Because value is based on location.

619
00:58:20,913 --> 00:58:23,334
If you make the location better, the value goes up.

620
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,034
But the price doesn't have to if the taxes also go up.

621
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:27,448
Thank you.

622
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,870
So we have two papers before us right now.

623
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:37,356
Name and address for the record.

624
00:58:37,376 --> 00:58:39,398
Robert Pentezero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

625
00:58:40,078 --> 00:58:43,741
I'm really getting confused on this whole issue right now, because I thought.

626
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:49,025
And I think, honestly, I think at this point, it's best to move it to Committee of the Whole and discuss it, because.

627
00:58:49,065 --> 00:58:50,066
Let me just ask this.

628
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:51,747
Let me ask just one question.

629
00:58:51,947 --> 00:58:52,067
OK.

630
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:54,730
And to me, this is where I would be going with it.

631
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:59,732
I'm trying to understand, you're telling me that don't raise the value of land.

632
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:05,494
And if you don't raise the value of land, you'll have a better neighborhood or a better atmosphere, so to speak.

633
00:59:06,174 --> 00:59:09,275
So with that being taken, taking place, what you're saying is that

634
00:59:10,936 --> 00:59:32,956
ignore zoning because zoning is a big reason why land values go up and if you are going to take out the free competitive spirit of Somebody buying a piece of property and doing what he wants by ignoring the zoning laws that absolutely exist at the present time whether it be for a chapter 40 B or affordable zoning that flies in the face of

635
00:59:33,656 --> 00:59:35,458
of what the petition is all about.

636
00:59:35,978 --> 00:59:47,108
And I think what Dr. Starello is basically trying to say, all you're doing is moving the debt from today till tomorrow, and when tomorrow comes, whether it's two today or 10 or 12 or 14, what are you dealing with?

637
00:59:47,469 --> 00:59:53,574
Somebody's gonna wind up paying for it, but in the meantime, it's a cost factor that's being reflected upon everyday taxpayer.

638
00:59:54,014 --> 00:59:58,438
So when somebody says that the value of land, don't put it on the value of land,

639
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:05,121
That seems to be the intrinsic value of how developers seem to come into a community, see the value.

640
01:00:05,281 --> 01:00:06,781
They don't care about the location.

641
01:00:06,821 --> 01:00:09,122
They don't care about what the density is going to do with it.

642
01:00:09,842 --> 01:00:15,464
And it's your zoning that's gonna predicate the value of land and its use of land and neighborhoods.

643
01:00:15,804 --> 01:00:19,045
That's how I read what Councilor Merrill just offered.

644
01:00:19,225 --> 01:00:19,585
Thank you.

645
01:00:19,645 --> 01:00:19,966
Thank you.

646
01:00:20,406 --> 01:00:22,906
So you have two papers before us, the B paper.

647
01:00:22,927 --> 01:00:27,588
Please have the clerk read the B paper back.

648
01:00:31,786 --> 01:00:42,472
The B paper, as I have it, is when the council stays with the current cap or sets a new cap, that the city include a copy of this notice the next time property tax bills are sent out.

649
01:00:43,393 --> 01:00:47,795
So on the motion of Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

650
01:00:48,035 --> 01:00:48,736
All those in favor?

651
01:00:48,756 --> 01:00:49,376
Aye.

652
01:00:49,656 --> 01:00:50,277
All those opposed?

653
01:00:50,297 --> 01:00:51,257
The motion passes.

654
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:57,741
On the main paper, that this issue be moved to Committee of the Whole.

655
01:00:58,986 --> 01:01:01,748
to be scheduled hopefully in the February-March time frame.

656
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:05,972
Offered by Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Caviello.

657
01:01:05,992 --> 01:01:06,732
All those in favor?

658
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:08,054
All those opposed?

659
01:01:09,815 --> 01:01:17,241
The issue will be moved to Committee of the Whole.

660
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:18,902
20-043 offered by Councilor Marks.

661
01:01:18,982 --> 01:01:25,648
Be it resolved that the parking revenue generated and promised for business district improvements be discussed

662
01:01:31,618 --> 01:01:32,178
Councilor Marks.

663
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:34,159
Thank you, Mr. President.

664
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,641
I hate to say it, but here we go again.

665
01:01:36,661 --> 01:01:56,971
This was a promise that was made back in 2014 when then Mayor McGlynn signed the parking contract enforcement with Republic Parking.

666
01:01:58,152 --> 01:02:17,820
And at the time when they were rolling out this program, because it was considered to be somewhat detrimental to the business districts because of the new parking regulations and could have possible impact to business and so forth.

667
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,622
could possibly deter people from using our business districts.

668
01:02:23,142 --> 01:02:45,935
At the time, Mayor McGlynn offered, and I sat on the committee, the parking enforcement committee at the time, offered an olive branch to the Chamber of Commerce saying that $250,000 would be used from the enforcement money received, and that would be $50,000 for each of the five business districts.

669
01:02:46,315 --> 01:02:47,936
That's where it came, all came out of.

670
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:53,161
And over the last several years, I've brought this up a half a dozen times.

671
01:02:53,862 --> 01:02:59,164
So if you heard this once, you'll hear it again and again, questioning where is this money?

672
01:02:59,684 --> 01:03:00,645
Where is it sitting?

673
01:03:00,965 --> 01:03:05,908
How come it hasn't been allocated to the different business districts?

674
01:03:06,388 --> 01:03:08,349
I know many of them, such as Meffitt Square.

675
01:03:08,769 --> 01:03:24,880
Salem Street Business Association, West Memphis Business Association, have met with their membership, have discussed improvements they'd like to see in the neighborhood, have taken these improvements back to the city administration, and for the last five years, nothing has happened.

676
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:33,766
So you can feel the sense of frustration, not only with the business owners, but us as a council, because I'm not the only one that has spoken about this, Mr. President.

677
01:03:35,146 --> 01:03:46,713
So, you know, and over the last few years I've heard, well, that was a commitment by the former mayor, and it doesn't mean the next mayor would carry it out, or that was just a one-year commitment.

678
01:03:47,594 --> 01:03:49,335
So I've heard a lot of different scuttlebutt.

679
01:03:49,975 --> 01:03:52,977
And if you look at Method Patch, dated October 2014,

680
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:57,580
The article is New Parking Enforcement in Meffitt.

681
01:03:58,141 --> 01:04:04,145
It states, Mayor Michael J. McGlynn signed the parking enforcement contract with Republic Parking System on Tuesday.

682
01:04:04,726 --> 01:04:09,690
The city of Meffitt hopes the new enforcement will benefit the business districts.

683
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:18,076
About $250,000 of revenue collected each year will go to improving the business districts.

684
01:04:18,737 --> 01:04:19,357
So that's one.

685
01:04:19,377 --> 01:04:20,538
That's the Meffitt patch.

686
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:23,000
So they must have heard it somewhere.

687
01:04:24,338 --> 01:04:33,761
City website, I assume someone from the city typed this in, dated October, again, 2014.

688
01:04:34,421 --> 01:04:38,543
And it says Meffitt signs parking enforcement contract.

689
01:04:39,823 --> 01:04:48,266
After deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, Mayor McGlynn is recommending the following changes to the plan.

690
01:04:49,567 --> 01:04:50,727
I'm not going to read all the changes.

691
01:04:51,647 --> 01:04:53,248
But this is one of them, Mr. President.

692
01:04:53,788 --> 01:05:04,535
Recommended 250,000 of revenue generated on a yearly basis, yearly basis, to be dedicated to the business district improvements.

693
01:05:06,617 --> 01:05:17,424
So based on what Mayor McGlynn offered back in 2014, we're looking at, because this was the end of 2014, right now we're looking at five years of backlog.

694
01:05:18,454 --> 01:05:24,056
So that's $1,250,000 that was promised to the business districts.

695
01:05:24,676 --> 01:05:27,898
They have yet to receive one red cent.

696
01:05:28,678 --> 01:05:33,580
And they've done a lot of work in their subcommittees putting together plans, Mr. President.

697
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:36,581
So I bring this up tonight for a number of reasons.

698
01:05:36,621 --> 01:05:39,002
The fact that we have a new administration.

699
01:05:40,063 --> 01:05:45,244
And I believe Mayor Lungo Kern is fully on board with this, Mr. President.

700
01:05:45,884 --> 01:05:56,386
But I bring it up to revitalize this and to start the dialogue again with the Chamber of Commerce to get this going, Mr. President.

701
01:05:56,846 --> 01:06:01,527
You can go into any one of our business districts, and they need attention.

702
01:06:02,368 --> 01:06:04,388
They all need attention.

703
01:06:05,356 --> 01:06:06,737
And I'm not pointing the finger at anyone.

704
01:06:07,017 --> 01:06:23,771
They need attention, whether it's sidewalks, barrels, you name it, Mr. President, lighting, anything that would increase traffic, increase viability in the business districts.

705
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:25,272
And the money was there.

706
01:06:25,312 --> 01:06:31,597
So tonight I'm asking, Mr. President, where is the money over the past five years?

707
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:35,116
So Mayor McGlynn gave the commitment.

708
01:06:36,096 --> 01:06:46,640
I'm not sure because Mayor Burke never really gave a response when I asked this over the last four years, other than the fact that the business districts were working on a proposal.

709
01:06:48,680 --> 01:07:01,865
So at this point, I'd like to know where the money is sitting, Mr. President, and I would respectfully ask, under this new administration, Mayor Lungo Kern, that this money, Mr. President, as soon as the plans are presented,

710
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:03,684
be given out.

711
01:07:04,064 --> 01:07:11,432
And even if we start off with the original commitment of $250,000 and move forward, I think we'd all be fine with that.

712
01:07:11,672 --> 01:07:17,879
And I think the chamber, I won't speak for them, I think they would be very happy to start that off, Mr. President.

713
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:19,961
And like I said, they have plans.

714
01:07:20,862 --> 01:07:21,803
They did their homework.

715
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:23,725
They know what improvements they'd like to see.

716
01:07:25,299 --> 01:07:27,840
Whether it's benches, there was a lot of things mentioned.

717
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:33,702
Power washing sidewalks, putting new lighting, putting some decorations in certain areas.

718
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:38,784
So new sidewalks in areas that could use it.

719
01:07:39,084 --> 01:07:41,105
So that's my resolution tonight, Mr. President.

720
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:43,986
I know Mayor Lungo Kern's going to follow up with this.

721
01:07:44,546 --> 01:07:52,029
And I feel comfortable moving forward that that commitment that was made in 2014 to the business districts will be kept, Mr. President.

722
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:52,909
Thank you.

723
01:07:53,089 --> 01:07:54,130
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

724
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:59,091
On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley, Councilor Cardiola.

725
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:00,051
Thank you, Mr. President.

726
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:10,854
I'm on board with Councilor Marks on this, being on the Chamber board for many years, and I think I was on the board back then when this first came through.

727
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:13,695
The Chamber's more than done their homework.

728
01:08:13,775 --> 01:08:14,875
They know where the money's needed.

729
01:08:15,235 --> 01:08:18,916
They've met, they've got their, listen, there, you give me the money tomorrow, there.

730
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:20,470
They know where to put it.

731
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:24,452
So let's not argue about where it's going.

732
01:08:24,472 --> 01:08:26,293
They know where it needs to go.

733
01:08:26,673 --> 01:08:34,136
But I recall the first $250,000 didn't come from revenue of the parking meters.

734
01:08:34,816 --> 01:08:38,778
Then Mayor McGlynn took it out of a sale of real estate, because that's where we got it right away.

735
01:08:39,558 --> 01:08:43,840
And it sat there, and where did it go after that?

736
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,321
I know Mayor Burke said it was there.

737
01:08:48,109 --> 01:09:11,062
Again, we have multiple councils in the city, so it's sitting in our coffers somewhere, but if we at least get the 250 out, get them going and get it, springtime, you know, spring will be coming up, let them go out and see what they want to do, so this way, when spring and summer goes, they're already in the improvements, we'll be all rolled all the way then, so.

738
01:09:11,142 --> 01:09:12,603
A motion for approval on Councilor Marks.

739
01:09:12,663 --> 01:09:13,603
Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

740
01:09:14,223 --> 01:09:16,625
On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

741
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,139
A roll call vote has been requested.

742
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,580
Clerk, could you please call the roll?

743
01:09:27,903 --> 01:09:28,063
Yes.

744
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:28,163
Yes.

745
01:09:28,183 --> 01:09:28,303
Yes.

746
01:09:28,323 --> 01:09:28,443
Yes.

747
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:28,783
Yes.

748
01:09:29,543 --> 01:09:29,723
Yes.

749
01:09:29,743 --> 01:09:29,823
Yes.

750
01:09:29,843 --> 01:09:29,923
Yes.

751
01:09:41,391 --> 01:09:51,640
20-044 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council wish Medford's 2019 Citizen of the Year, Rosemary Adagna, a very happy 80th birthday.

752
01:09:52,561 --> 01:09:53,061
Councilor Knight.

753
01:09:53,481 --> 01:10:00,628
Mr. President, I believe it was early in December that we were up here singing Rosemary praises for her recent achievement being named Medford's 2019 Citizen of the Year.

754
01:10:02,814 --> 01:10:09,001
And as such, just recently, at the end of this month, earlier this month, she celebrated a very momentous birthday.

755
01:10:09,661 --> 01:10:11,583
So it's been quite a year for Rosemary.

756
01:10:11,623 --> 01:10:14,066
She became a citizen of the year and an octogenarian.

757
01:10:14,487 --> 01:10:18,311
I'd like to wish her a very happy 80th birthday and ask my council colleagues to join her.

758
01:10:18,931 --> 01:10:19,752
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

759
01:10:21,094 --> 01:10:21,814
Councilor Caviello.

760
01:10:22,235 --> 01:10:22,915
Thank you, Mr. President.

761
01:10:24,639 --> 01:10:26,721
I want to wish Rosemary a happy 8th birthday.

762
01:10:27,902 --> 01:10:32,005
Her and I are longtime friends and I hope I have the amount of energy when I'm 80 that she has.

763
01:10:32,025 --> 01:10:36,208
I mean, the woman's out there volunteering and doing things like she's 50.

764
01:10:36,248 --> 01:10:40,271
So again, congratulations on her 80th birthday.

765
01:10:41,532 --> 01:10:42,673
Thank you, Councilor Carvajal.

766
01:10:44,435 --> 01:10:48,157
On behalf of the City Council, happy birthday to Rosemary.

767
01:10:48,538 --> 01:10:51,180
Now the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

768
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:51,960
All those in favor?

769
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,181
Aye.

770
01:10:52,401 --> 01:10:53,001
All those opposed?

771
01:10:53,021 --> 01:10:53,762
The motion passes.

772
01:10:56,980 --> 01:11:04,282
20-045 offered by Vice President Caviello be it resolved that the Medford City Council adopt an ordinance regulating donation collection bins.

773
01:11:05,062 --> 01:11:24,205
The purpose of this ordinance is to protect the public health, safety and to address the donation collection bins within the City of Medford and to provide regulations to ensure that donation collection bins are located and maintained so as to promote public safety, health and welfare in a clean and safe condition.

774
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:32,273
We have further resolved that the city of Medford established a permit and applicable fee for collection boxes.

775
01:11:32,293 --> 01:11:35,034
Councilor Caviello.

776
01:11:35,054 --> 01:11:35,634
Thank you, Mr. President.

777
01:11:35,774 --> 01:11:46,378
This is something I brought up, I think, two weeks ago in regards to a couple of the boxes in the city that were strewn with trash all around them.

778
01:11:47,738 --> 01:11:52,540
I got a call from a gentleman from Planet Aid explaining to me what happened.

779
01:11:53,427 --> 01:12:02,753
and to get it cleaned up, but he had asked me why we don't have an ordinance in the city of Medford in regards to regulating these boxes.

780
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,380
And I didn't know.

781
01:12:05,941 --> 01:12:09,303
And he, in turn, sent me a couple of ordinances from different cities.

782
01:12:09,963 --> 01:12:11,644
And they were pretty good.

783
01:12:11,684 --> 01:12:17,127
But what he explained to me is what's happening is there's people that come out with boxes.

784
01:12:17,668 --> 01:12:19,729
And they just put them on people's property.

785
01:12:19,809 --> 01:12:20,589
And people don't know.

786
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:23,111
A lot of people, they're absentee landlords or things.

787
01:12:23,511 --> 01:12:25,793
They don't know where they came from.

788
01:12:25,853 --> 01:12:28,914
And there's no identification of where the boxes are.

789
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:32,497
In fact, I didn't realize that Planet Aid

790
01:12:33,294 --> 01:12:34,835
It's got six boxes in the city.

791
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:39,539
I don't know where they all are, but there's boxes out there.

792
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:40,719
There's boxes for books.

793
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:41,800
There's boxes for a lot of things.

794
01:12:42,481 --> 01:12:46,924
But some of these companies that operate these are for profit.

795
01:12:47,004 --> 01:12:48,745
They're not all non-profit organizations.

796
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:52,108
And what also happens is now they're becoming garbage dumps.

797
01:12:53,049 --> 01:13:01,032
Because people have a television, they don't want to spend the $25 to get the ticket for waste manager to take it.

798
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:06,274
Or there's just toys that they can't fit in the barrel and the rubbish man won't take them.

799
01:13:06,574 --> 01:13:11,556
And now these guys that own these bins, spending thousands and thousands of dollars.

800
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:20,445
to what started out as a good idea for donations, now they're becoming trash receptacles for people who have nowhere to go with their rubbish.

801
01:13:20,785 --> 01:13:35,774
So I ask that the solicitor adopt an ordinance, and I have a couple that I'll forward to her that was given, and to establish a permit and fee process for the city of Medford.

802
01:13:36,575 --> 01:13:38,696
Do you want to send this to the city solicitor then?

803
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:43,762
I will send her a couple of the ordinances that he sent me from a couple of different cities.

804
01:13:45,243 --> 01:13:46,324
Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

805
01:13:47,024 --> 01:13:47,525
Councilor Knight.

806
01:13:49,646 --> 01:13:51,188
Mr. President, thank you very much.

807
01:13:51,808 --> 01:13:56,231
Paper 17321 was introduced in 2017 before the council.

808
01:13:56,312 --> 01:14:05,679
It had gone through a subcommittee process and was a paper that was reported out favorably by the subcommittee on ordinances, I do believe, and then was never scheduled for a committee of the whole.

809
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:10,925
And that was a paper that was also designed to regulate drop boxes here in the community of Medford.

810
01:14:11,665 --> 01:14:16,309
During the deliberations and discussions of this issue, one thing came up that was very important.

811
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:24,015
We have a textile recycling fundraising program at our elementary schools and our middle schools and

812
01:14:27,352 --> 01:14:32,514
facilities exemption was something that was very important at the time, and I'm sure that still holds true.

813
01:14:32,934 --> 01:14:43,979
So moving forward, if we're going to regulate donation drop boxes by way of ordinance, I'd just like to request that school and city facilities be excluded from the ordinance.

814
01:14:45,459 --> 01:14:46,340
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

815
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,681
Is that an amendment to the main paper?

816
01:14:49,701 --> 01:14:51,682
That would be an amendment to the main paper, Mr. President.

817
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:54,763
Councilor Pierce.

818
01:14:55,514 --> 01:14:57,395
As someone who used textile recycling this week.

819
01:14:57,676 --> 01:14:58,036
Thank you.

820
01:14:58,196 --> 01:14:58,756
Counselor night.

821
01:14:59,437 --> 01:15:08,782
And I also that yeah I got it from the first but much appreciated.

822
01:15:10,643 --> 01:15:17,688
I think this is an important issue and I just wanted to make my own joke which is I think it's always good when the person you're trying to regulate is asking for regulations.

823
01:15:17,828 --> 01:15:19,189
So I'm encouraged by this.

824
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,969
Thank you.

825
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:20,790
And my time.

826
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:22,451
Marks.

827
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:27,158
Thank you, Mr. President.

828
01:15:27,178 --> 01:15:35,525
This has been, as Councilor Knight alluded to, a long ongoing issue in the community regulating these drop boxes.

829
01:15:35,926 --> 01:15:39,729
I want to thank Councilor Caviello for doing the homework and research on it.

830
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:42,231
I think it's a magnificent idea.

831
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:49,317
I would also recommend, in addition to what Councilor Knight mentioned about those amendments which were a concern,

832
01:15:49,997 --> 01:15:56,219
because we don't want to impact fundraising and so forth of any type of school facility and so forth.

833
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:02,501
But these boxes at the very least, Mr. President, should have some type of ID tag on them.

834
01:16:03,021 --> 01:16:03,641
Who owns it?

835
01:16:03,961 --> 01:16:04,782
Who operates it?

836
01:16:05,082 --> 01:16:06,042
A contact number?

837
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:08,483
There's nothing on these boxes at all.

838
01:16:10,163 --> 01:16:12,864
Point of information, Councilor Caviello.

839
01:16:16,325 --> 01:16:26,978
Other cities require them to put a point of contact on them and get permission from the property owner to put this box on so you know that it's in the right spot.

840
01:16:28,039 --> 01:16:28,260
Thank you.

841
01:16:30,762 --> 01:16:39,384
No, I just wanted to make those points that at the very least, Mr. President, like I mentioned last time this was brought up, we regulate dumpsters.

842
01:16:40,084 --> 01:16:50,106
If you're doing some home improvement and you want to get a dumpster, we not only regulate it, we charge you a fee, but someone could pop up a dumpster in any open lot outside.

843
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:56,167
The one on the Fells where I keep referring to because I drive by it all the time, there are five boxes out there now.

844
01:16:56,547 --> 01:16:59,948
It's not about one medium-sized box, there's a large,

845
01:17:00,828 --> 01:17:03,411
Giant box out there with four small ones.

846
01:17:03,631 --> 01:17:04,592
Looked like it had babies.

847
01:17:05,573 --> 01:17:06,874
Four smaller boxes now.

848
01:17:07,435 --> 01:17:09,617
And there's stuff all over the place out there.

849
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,279
And people are constantly dropping things off.

850
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,462
You go out there, anytime there's always items out there.

851
01:17:15,783 --> 01:17:17,384
And it's a safety issue, Mr. President.

852
01:17:18,065 --> 01:17:20,107
What if a little kid climbs in one of these boxes?

853
01:17:21,035 --> 01:17:22,555
You know, we have no way of getting in these.

854
01:17:22,575 --> 01:17:24,736
We have no way of, no contact.

855
01:17:24,756 --> 01:17:26,216
We don't know who's operating them.

856
01:17:26,576 --> 01:17:27,737
It's a real safety concern.

857
01:17:27,797 --> 01:17:28,177
Absolutely.

858
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:29,837
I want to thank Councilor Caviello.

859
01:17:29,857 --> 01:17:30,117
Thank you.

860
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:33,378
So Councilor March, are you offering that as an amendment, the tags and the?

861
01:17:33,678 --> 01:17:36,039
I'll offer it at the time of the committee meeting, so no, no.

862
01:17:36,999 --> 01:17:40,900
On the motion of Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Knight.

863
01:17:42,179 --> 01:17:42,799
All those in favor?

864
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:43,919
All those opposed?

865
01:17:44,179 --> 01:17:47,160
The motion passes.

866
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:49,401
20-046 offered by Councilor Beers and Councilor Morrell.

867
01:17:49,901 --> 01:17:56,222
Be it resolved that the issue of applications for new housing developments made under Chapter 40B be discussed.

868
01:18:03,504 --> 01:18:04,404
Thank you, Mr. President.

869
01:18:07,597 --> 01:18:21,803
Introduce this resolution with Councillor Morrell because as I think many people in the room and it's already come up once tonight but also many people across the city know there are now several applications under Chapter 40 B for a large new housing developments.

870
01:18:22,423 --> 01:18:24,984
There is the one on Mystic Valley Parkway.

871
01:18:25,624 --> 01:18:29,866
There's also one on the Fells way and now combined properties has issued.

872
01:18:30,727 --> 01:18:33,250
At least started the process around Mystic Avenue.

873
01:18:34,391 --> 01:18:37,474
These are I mean I think those add up to almost a thousand new units.

874
01:18:37,514 --> 01:18:38,575
It might even be more than that.

875
01:18:38,595 --> 01:18:39,956
I'll have to double check my math.

876
01:18:40,076 --> 01:18:42,498
But obviously that's significant new development.

877
01:18:43,739 --> 01:18:49,424
And it's happening under state statute that limits some of our ability to control development.

878
01:18:51,089 --> 01:18:58,199
I think as I've said many times to people that all of this development should be community driven.

879
01:18:58,219 --> 01:19:01,424
We need to have community driven processes to make sure that development is happening.

880
01:19:01,806 --> 01:19:10,269
The way that we wanted to happen, not the way that developers wanted to happen, but as I said, anything that's coming through 40 B puts us in a much more difficult position to get that done.

881
01:19:11,569 --> 01:19:20,592
We will need strong community and administrative pushback, or at least, you know, really a strong movement around these projects to see what we can do.

882
01:19:21,272 --> 01:19:25,957
To make them fit into the community and in a reasonable way if possible.

883
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:30,742
And I think it just speaks a couple things specifically on 40 B that I want to get out there.

884
01:19:30,762 --> 01:19:38,409
It really speaks to the need to get to safe harbor around this so that we can make sure that developers are negotiating with the city and with the community.

885
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:51,062
And also just speaks to the fact that on any of these in any of these developments all of the affordable you know the defined affordable units need to be in perpetuity.

886
01:19:51,702 --> 01:19:56,666
We need to make sure that those units are permanent to the best extent possible.

887
01:19:57,228 --> 01:20:03,411
And I want to turn it over to Councillor Morrell, who I believe spoke to the administration and has some updates as well.

888
01:20:04,732 --> 01:20:05,612
Thank you, Mr President.

889
01:20:06,132 --> 01:20:15,857
So, yeah, we introduced this because I know I feel already a lot of questions from residents about what voice residents and the city has in this process process.

890
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:19,639
And we're in a somewhat unprecedented place with three applications.

891
01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:22,290
At this time for 40 B projects.

892
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:31,076
So I did speak with the mayor about this, and she informed me that she'll be engaging an expert to speak with department heads in City Hall on 40 be within the next couple of weeks.

893
01:20:31,596 --> 01:20:36,780
And that is something that counselors will be invited to, um, hopefully something we can report back out on.

894
01:20:37,447 --> 01:21:02,177
And then I guess that mass housing will also provide a consultant so that something else she may be pursuing So just options to look at so just the idea that when this is in place after we've had these meetings these briefings Having a public meeting or committee the whole set to this so that we can have someone a department had someone from the building department who is up to speed on where we stand with all these applications and what

895
01:21:02,677 --> 01:21:09,641
power we have can present this out and provide a bit of a forum for people to ask questions about what this will look like going forward.

896
01:21:10,801 --> 01:21:11,622
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

897
01:21:13,723 --> 01:21:14,443
Councilor Carvillo.

898
01:21:14,683 --> 01:21:15,624
Thank you, Mr. President.

899
01:21:18,285 --> 01:21:31,312
Over the weekend, myself and Councilor Falco took a workshop in regards to some of these things, but in talking to some people in regards to this, I'm led to believe that the city is able to go out and bring in an advocate.

900
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:34,270
similar to a project manager that we have in particular.

901
01:21:34,611 --> 01:21:40,657
But this person here goes out and advocates for the city for the 40B projects.

902
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:43,519
He and this person gets paid for by the developer.

903
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:48,785
So I don't know if that's something that we've done or we intend to do.

904
01:21:48,845 --> 01:21:53,750
But they're out there and from what I'm told, these people are very successful.

905
01:21:54,431 --> 01:22:00,593
There's three or four different companies that go out there and really fight for the cities with 40B projects.

906
01:22:01,093 --> 01:22:02,534
And they do get results.

907
01:22:02,554 --> 01:22:14,518
So if I can make it a B paper, that the city check out this option of hiring the advocate that is paid for by the developer.

908
01:22:15,038 --> 01:22:16,859
So we've got three projects going.

909
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:22,521
I think we can get one advocate to go out there and work for the city in all three.

910
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,001
Thank you, Councilor Caviello.

911
01:22:31,508 --> 01:22:32,369
Name and address for the record.

912
01:22:33,551 --> 01:22:35,452
Barpenta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

913
01:22:35,972 --> 01:22:39,573
So this is going to reflect back on some of the comments that I made a little bit earlier.

914
01:22:40,033 --> 01:22:51,377
First of all, the City of Medford is a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, and they have individuals who are very professional in the housing portion of what we're talking about here right now.

915
01:22:51,397 --> 01:22:58,760
To go out and hire a private consultant that pushes and advocates for Chapter 40B, I don't think would be a very wise idea.

916
01:23:00,424 --> 01:23:01,445
Oh, against the 40B.

917
01:23:01,825 --> 01:23:03,526
I thought you said... I'm sorry.

918
01:23:04,927 --> 01:23:12,751
Well, you may not have to do that because if the Office of Community Development gets itself redesigned, hopefully you would have somebody up there who would understand what the process is.

919
01:23:12,771 --> 01:23:14,132
You have to understand something.

920
01:23:14,152 --> 01:23:24,257
There's a difference between Chapter 40B, which does come under a few Massachusetts housing management departments, as compared to affordable housing.

921
01:23:24,337 --> 01:23:27,059
Affordable housing is usually a private,

922
01:23:27,779 --> 01:23:38,264
But working with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who to some degree sets some standards up there as it relates to not only affordability, which has to be, but the permanent and perpetuity of having the

923
01:23:40,091 --> 01:23:44,854
the reduced cost unit, whether it be the rental or whether it be the housing.

924
01:23:45,694 --> 01:23:49,376
Chapter 40B is made for a private developer.

925
01:23:49,536 --> 01:23:58,241
He'll come in there and say in the city of Medford, well, you've got to get between, your income level has to be 80% of the medium income in the area that you're applying to put the housing in.

926
01:23:58,642 --> 01:24:02,184
And if that be the case, you know, we can do that or we'll put 100 units up.

927
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:10,020
25, 2025, whatever the number's gonna turn out to be, will be affordable, and we'll just raise the cost on the other end of the units.

928
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,721
So what did you wind up getting?

929
01:24:12,341 --> 01:24:14,862
You really didn't complete anything.

930
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:23,808
Me personally, my suggestion would be that the city goes into a complete moratorium on any and all development to take place, because you don't have anything right now.

931
01:24:24,228 --> 01:24:28,631
You have a Chapter 40B person who can come in, who just came in right now on Mystic Avenue,

932
01:24:29,591 --> 01:24:35,859
and will bypass your height restrictions and other zoning requirements because that's what 40B is allowed to do.

933
01:24:35,919 --> 01:24:44,009
If you read chapter 69 of chapter 49, excuse me, of chapter 40B, that's what they'll tell you.

934
01:24:44,229 --> 01:24:46,151
They can come in and they detour and they go around.

935
01:24:46,972 --> 01:24:51,916
And I know you guys, Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli, have talked about over the last two or three years, zoning.

936
01:24:52,296 --> 01:25:05,125
So maybe you should hire a zoning consultant right now to figure out how you bring up an update of a 40-year-old zoning that you have here in the city of Medford because every Chapter 40B that comes in here will bypass upstairs and they'll get around it.

937
01:25:05,606 --> 01:25:10,529
And that's the privilege that you have for being a Chapter 40B participant, okay?

938
01:25:10,589 --> 01:25:11,730
So if you want to have a Chapter 40B

939
01:25:13,231 --> 01:25:16,773
be participant that works with the city, then that's what you need.

940
01:25:16,813 --> 01:25:22,357
You need to have someone who goes into the neighborhood and sees where the project is going and how is it going to enhance.

941
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:25,419
It's not gonna produce a density buster.

942
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:27,680
That's what you don't want, and that's what's happening right now.

943
01:25:28,281 --> 01:25:32,123
Density busting all over the city, because private developers know how to do it.

944
01:25:32,784 --> 01:25:36,906
They're efficient at doing it, they make it sound good, and what do you have left?

945
01:25:37,387 --> 01:25:39,288
You have all these developments all over the place.

946
01:25:40,797 --> 01:25:46,959
schools, police, fire, public works, infrastructure, water and sewer.

947
01:25:47,159 --> 01:25:50,060
It's all affected by this, all affected by this.

948
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:59,683
And while it might sound good that it looks good, that's what you're paying for in your taxes for which our commercial tax rate can't even handle because it's only a 10%.

949
01:26:00,664 --> 01:26:04,525
So the burden once again is right back onto the residential taxpayer.

950
01:26:05,025 --> 01:26:07,026
I think it's a great idea to get into the discussion.

951
01:26:08,442 --> 01:26:17,785
But if you read this case after case after case where cities and towns are so sorry that they went into Chapter 40B because it did not turn out to be what it was supposed to be.

952
01:26:18,185 --> 01:26:26,487
And the fastest way to correct a Chapter 40B problem is to make sure that your zoning speaks for what you want today and for tomorrow.

953
01:26:26,767 --> 01:26:31,828
It's the financial viability of what a community has to deal with as it relates to a Chapter 40B.

954
01:26:32,409 --> 01:26:34,949
Not affordable housing, it's a Chapter 40B.

955
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:37,410
They're in two entirely different requirements.

956
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:39,671
Point of information, Mr. President.

957
01:26:39,711 --> 01:26:41,292
We have a number of point of information here.

958
01:26:41,652 --> 01:26:46,214
No, that's right, Councilor Beasley, you hit your microphone first, so you go first, and then Councilor Marks.

959
01:26:46,374 --> 01:26:47,815
Thank you, Mr. President.

960
01:26:48,015 --> 01:26:55,219
Just a point of information, which is that even if we were to do a moratorium because of how Chapter 40B is written, these projects could move forward anyway.

961
01:26:55,379 --> 01:26:58,861
So that's kind of the crux of the issue here, is we need to

962
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:09,051
That that if we did a moratorium then and then we could still get 40 B applications in that move through the process outside of our zoning and height and design restrictions and whatnot.

963
01:27:09,111 --> 01:27:16,079
So so that's part of the point is I think we need to get to that safe harbor point where 40 B is not the threat that it is right now.

964
01:27:17,481 --> 01:27:19,343
Well you can still appears cut from our.

965
01:27:20,526 --> 01:27:23,948
Actually, Councilor Beers just reiterated what I was going to state.

966
01:27:25,709 --> 01:27:33,494
I was wondering if Councilor Pinto was aware of any community that did have a moratorium that a 40B project was not allowed at.

967
01:27:34,154 --> 01:27:36,876
Well, if you go to the city of Somerville, they just went through it for a year and a half.

968
01:27:37,236 --> 01:27:44,500
They stopped, they had a moratorium as it relates to that type of development that took place over there because of what was taking place so fast.

969
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:46,081
And that stopped a potential 40B project?

970
01:27:46,301 --> 01:27:47,802
They did nothing for that period of time.

971
01:27:48,442 --> 01:27:51,063
as it relates to multi-use development.

972
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,844
But was there a 40B project offered during that period of time?

973
01:27:54,404 --> 01:27:56,725
To the best of my, to moratorium, so that means you can't.

974
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:58,265
Another point of information.

975
01:27:58,305 --> 01:28:00,846
I don't know if that's, yeah.

976
01:28:00,886 --> 01:28:02,407
Point of information, Councilor Beers.

977
01:28:02,507 --> 01:28:09,689
Somerville was at their 10% safe harbor threshold, so they couldn't get 40B the way that we can, being under that percentage.

978
01:28:10,871 --> 01:28:25,676
One of the things that a Chapter 40B does tell you, if they go before a Board of Appeals, if the Board of Appeals feels, this is the term that they use, and it's not a friendly Chapter 40B, that's the term, friendly, they can shoot that down.

979
01:28:26,196 --> 01:28:28,177
Now, what determines to be friendly?

980
01:28:29,157 --> 01:28:31,638
It could be public health, it could be public safety.

981
01:28:31,678 --> 01:28:34,339
Those are the two biggest issues that you'd have going.

982
01:28:34,879 --> 01:28:37,740
Other than being in a residential neighborhood and making it high density,

983
01:28:38,953 --> 01:28:39,914
That's a subjective thought.

984
01:28:40,194 --> 01:28:41,354
That's all I can tell you.

985
01:28:42,055 --> 01:29:00,184
But if you are going to hire somebody, or Office of Community Development is going to employ somebody, consultant or otherwise, that's the first thing I would address, because you have such archaic laws, you can go to the Board of Appeals right now and come in and make a proposal, and you can't shoot it down, because YDB will allow you to do it.

986
01:29:03,814 --> 01:29:18,429
It's an interesting concept and the city of Medford really needs to address it because you've gone at a fever pitch over the past many years with all kinds of development and there's no checks and balances to it.

987
01:29:18,449 --> 01:29:22,232
61 Locust Street is really the issue that should bring this all to a head.

988
01:29:22,713 --> 01:29:25,035
It should have brought it to a head then when they wanted to put 500 units there.

989
01:29:26,676 --> 01:29:28,058
Okay, and what did they do?

990
01:29:28,499 --> 01:29:38,452
The big developer went in there and bought out the neighborhood, bought out every single house in the neighborhood, and they reduced it to 345, which the Board of Appeals allowed, and it managed to put itself through.

991
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,222
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

992
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:47,046
I think it's important to point out that this council sued the Board of Appeals relative to that decision that they made.

993
01:29:47,086 --> 01:29:48,588
We took this case to court and we lost.

994
01:29:48,608 --> 01:29:50,389
We were found to not have standing.

995
01:29:51,190 --> 01:30:00,918
I believe that the reason, I believe Councilor, the reason why the city lost is because the neighborhood agreed to the reduction of $345,000 after they all got bought out.

996
01:30:01,379 --> 01:30:04,842
So our suit was completely moved at that point in time.

997
01:30:05,823 --> 01:30:07,124
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

998
01:30:09,175 --> 01:30:12,177
The Medford City Council filed suit and was thrown out.

999
01:30:12,638 --> 01:30:22,225
And the land court judge had found the city legislative body had zero standing to appeal the issue.

1000
01:30:22,466 --> 01:30:28,250
But they felt it had zero standing, but also the then mayor at the time refused to give additional money to go forward with the case.

1001
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:29,371
We got thrown out.

1002
01:30:31,493 --> 01:30:32,133
You could have appealed.

1003
01:30:32,153 --> 01:30:34,435
We spent $60,000 to be told we didn't have standing.

1004
01:30:37,601 --> 01:30:40,065
Then the question was, are we going to spend another 60 grand to be told that again?

1005
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:47,269
But I rest my case, but I just wanted to point out the factual history of the process and what went down with Locust Street.

1006
01:30:47,449 --> 01:30:48,309
Thank you, Councilman.

1007
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:51,171
We weren't sitting back on our hands saying, oh, Locust Street's going on.

1008
01:30:51,191 --> 01:30:51,851
That's not what happened.

1009
01:30:51,891 --> 01:30:52,571
We sued the city.

1010
01:30:52,631 --> 01:30:54,012
We sued the zoning board.

1011
01:30:54,052 --> 01:31:03,835
But I also believe, Mr. President, when you lost the issue on standing, it was a moot issue, because all the people, the residents, pushed back on the lawsuit, because they all got bought out.

1012
01:31:04,315 --> 01:31:10,778
So the standing for which the council had was not being supported by the neighborhood, which initiated the lawsuit in the first place.

1013
01:31:12,076 --> 01:31:16,178
And the council got originally $20,000 in the beginning to get the case going.

1014
01:31:17,739 --> 01:31:19,120
I believe it was 40, Mr. President.

1015
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:23,782
And we weren't, we weren't, we weren't, uh, you know, co-defendants or co-appellants.

1016
01:31:23,962 --> 01:31:31,046
We were an individual entity that moved forward as a, in a silo, not with the neighborhood, not with anybody else, but we're in the best interest of the community.

1017
01:31:31,686 --> 01:31:31,926
Thank you.

1018
01:31:31,966 --> 01:31:32,367
Counselor Knight.

1019
01:31:32,867 --> 01:31:34,368
Mr. Castagnetti, would you like to speak?

1020
01:31:34,988 --> 01:31:36,429
Please come close to the microphone.

1021
01:31:36,609 --> 01:31:37,469
Haven't decided yet.

1022
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:39,430
Okay.

1023
01:31:39,871 --> 01:31:40,731
Haven't decided yet.

1024
01:31:41,718 --> 01:31:43,479
Andrew, Cush Street, Medford, Mass.

1025
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,342
There's been some good points and concerns brought up with this Chapter 40B.

1026
01:31:49,362 --> 01:31:55,405
If I remember correctly, one of my many jobs was 30 years ago about real estate.

1027
01:31:55,425 --> 01:32:08,232
For the layman out there that doesn't know what it is, correct me if I'm wrong, but the gist of it is, in any city or town, specifically here, we're speaking of Medford,

1028
01:32:11,539 --> 01:32:37,471
If our total housing stock is not at 10% or higher affordability, that a developer can come in from wherever, from the world, and buy a nice piece of valuable land, and pretty much do what they want, or should I say, circumvent the present zoning laws, if there are any at that area.

1029
01:32:38,991 --> 01:32:40,392
I believe it's something to that effect.

1030
01:32:41,112 --> 01:32:41,573
Make sense?

1031
01:32:41,813 --> 01:32:42,493
You are correct, sir.

1032
01:32:42,674 --> 01:32:42,914
Correct.

1033
01:32:43,034 --> 01:32:44,074
Thank you, Counselor Knight.

1034
01:32:45,535 --> 01:32:47,737
So I want to say you ain't seen nothing yet.

1035
01:32:48,297 --> 01:32:55,282
We're at a crossroads with this boom times during this election year.

1036
01:32:56,863 --> 01:33:07,090
And unless there's a major crash, whether it's Dow Jones or real estate, we ain't seen nothing yet, if you think about it.

1037
01:33:07,961 --> 01:33:09,963
because we're not at the 10% threshold yet.

1038
01:33:10,743 --> 01:33:16,267
So, and I used to live on Mystic Avenue as a youth.

1039
01:33:18,109 --> 01:33:22,852
And that was a major highway to Boston, Route 38.

1040
01:33:24,454 --> 01:33:27,396
And then in 1960, they built this Route 93.

1041
01:33:29,217 --> 01:33:32,340
By eminent domain, they took property and schools, et cetera.

1042
01:33:34,101 --> 01:33:37,544
So we have very valuable location.

1043
01:33:39,602 --> 01:33:41,743
three to five miles north of Boston.

1044
01:33:43,204 --> 01:33:58,513
So, also, it was mentioned about, months ago, about MAC, not a Big Mac, but Mystic Ave... Community?

1045
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:00,534
Mystic Ave Corridor.

1046
01:34:01,775 --> 01:34:02,435
The Big Mac.

1047
01:34:05,817 --> 01:34:08,679
Although no McDonald's is in Bedford, Burger King's down there.

1048
01:34:10,947 --> 01:34:29,425
But the point is, unless we get a handle on this, if it's possible to avoid this 40B being jammed on our throats with all this congestion we already have, without our Orange Line subway behind you, we're gonna be in deep stuff, man.

1049
01:34:31,407 --> 01:34:31,548
So.

1050
01:34:32,762 --> 01:34:43,487
I'm not sure if you can do moratoriums or anything that's fancy with those 25 cent words, but chances are you can't if we're already in this 40 B thing with the state.

1051
01:34:44,728 --> 01:34:50,231
But, carverum tuor, buyer beware, be careful.

1052
01:34:50,611 --> 01:34:53,212
Thank you, Mr. Casagnetti.

1053
01:34:53,712 --> 01:34:58,415
On the B paper offered by Councilor Carviello, seconded by Councilor Light.

1054
01:34:59,995 --> 01:35:00,776
All those in favor?

1055
01:35:00,976 --> 01:35:01,076
Aye.

1056
01:35:02,605 --> 01:35:03,266
All those opposed?

1057
01:35:04,366 --> 01:35:05,207
The motion passes.

1058
01:35:06,008 --> 01:35:12,633
On the main paper offered by Councilors Beers and Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1059
01:35:13,414 --> 01:35:14,114
All those in favor?

1060
01:35:14,134 --> 01:35:14,194
Aye.

1061
01:35:14,795 --> 01:35:15,495
All those opposed?

1062
01:35:15,536 --> 01:35:16,416
The motion passes.

1063
01:35:17,117 --> 01:35:20,520
What's the motion?

1064
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:27,826
20-047 offered by Councilor Beers, be it resolved that the issue of funding for the City Council to hire additional legal services be discussed.

1065
01:35:28,546 --> 01:35:29,367
Councilor Beers.

1066
01:35:33,683 --> 01:35:34,704
Thank you Mr. President.

1067
01:35:35,484 --> 01:35:37,106
So I think there's two issues here.

1068
01:35:37,366 --> 01:35:40,128
One is let me preface this.

1069
01:35:40,168 --> 01:35:46,974
So the issue here is that the council should have the ability to have its own legal services for a variety of reasons.

1070
01:35:47,254 --> 01:36:00,284
I think in just permanently I think it's important for the council to have that resource so that we can get legal opinions and have legal services independent of the executive branch of the city administration.

1071
01:36:00,305 --> 01:36:03,227
I think that will be always permanent but also

1072
01:36:03,877 --> 01:36:08,421
I think the current circumstances facing the city bring us to.

1073
01:36:09,946 --> 01:36:16,869
I won't say a unique point but kind of we're coming to a head with the amount of ordinances and other work that we're going to need to do especially as a council.

1074
01:36:18,269 --> 01:36:24,352
And also we know the city solicitors currently enacting city solicitors so there is a process to hire a permanent city solicitor.

1075
01:36:25,232 --> 01:36:35,417
So I think there's both good reasons at all times why the council should have legal services and also very important reasons at this moment as to why the council should have legal services and

1076
01:36:37,108 --> 01:36:46,431
My motion on the issue would be that we make sure to add it to the future agenda of our committee of the whole meeting with the mayor, which I believe is forthcoming.

1077
01:36:46,891 --> 01:36:47,752
Um, correct.

1078
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:49,072
Yeah.

1079
01:36:49,112 --> 01:36:49,392
Thank you.

1080
01:36:49,412 --> 01:36:49,913
Council.

1081
01:36:50,013 --> 01:37:00,896
I'm meeting with, uh, uh, may I go current, um, next Wednesday and then I'll be scheduling, scheduling a committee, the whole soon after that to talk about all our priorities.

1082
01:37:00,996 --> 01:37:03,417
And this is something that will be addressed as well.

1083
01:37:03,637 --> 01:37:03,877
Great.

1084
01:37:03,957 --> 01:37:04,758
And that's great.

1085
01:37:04,998 --> 01:37:05,298
Thank you.

1086
01:37:06,058 --> 01:37:07,239
I thank you for bringing this forward.

1087
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:08,320
Counselor Knight.

1088
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,901
Mr. President, I support the resolution wholeheartedly.

1089
01:37:10,921 --> 01:37:22,129
I do think it's important to point out that if the council does have in fact legal counsel to provide it with legal opinions, the legal opinions relative to ethics and the like would have to come from

1090
01:37:22,648 --> 01:37:32,610
Statutorily, the city solicitor's office, we can't have our own council giving us opinions related to that, but we can use this person for the very important job of drafting framework ordinances, Mr. President.

1091
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:33,351
That's something we need.

1092
01:37:33,971 --> 01:37:50,475
It's something, you know, just in the very short time that we've been meeting as a council, we've taken, you know, several resolutions that have been filed that we've been asking for draft ordinances to be put together on that have been two and three and four years in the making, not because the city solicitor wasn't able to do it,

1093
01:37:52,152 --> 01:38:01,176
Capability-wise, it was because he has to run the everyday operations of an entire city, as well as, you know, that he had the requests that this body makes.

1094
01:38:01,957 --> 01:38:04,418
So with that being said, I think that this is a step in the right direction.

1095
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:08,179
It was my number two priority, Mr. President, when we talked about council priorities.

1096
01:38:08,219 --> 01:38:16,003
Number one, improving the way we deliver services here in this community, making sure that when you pick up the phone and call because your trash barrel wasn't picked up, that someone comes and picks it up for you.

1097
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:18,004
When you say there's a pothole in front of your house, it gets fixed.

1098
01:38:18,344 --> 01:38:20,005
When your sidewalk needs to be repaired, it gets done.

1099
01:38:20,445 --> 01:38:22,866
Number one priority, service delivery and improving the way we do it.

1100
01:38:22,927 --> 01:38:30,271
Number two priority, getting counsel for the Medford City Council so that we can put out a better work product at a faster pace, Mr. President.

1101
01:38:31,371 --> 01:38:32,232
Thank you, Counsel Knight.

1102
01:38:32,312 --> 01:38:32,712
Well said.

1103
01:38:33,352 --> 01:38:34,473
Name and address for the record, please.

1104
01:38:34,493 --> 01:38:35,894
John Sorrell, Metcalfe Street.

1105
01:38:36,894 --> 01:38:37,755
Thank you, Mr. President.

1106
01:38:38,794 --> 01:38:43,797
This is another example of an increase in taxes, which we don't really need.

1107
01:38:44,517 --> 01:38:48,499
I mean, here we are, we've taken on additional, we already have a solicitor.

1108
01:38:48,559 --> 01:38:50,159
Point of information, Counselor Knight.

1109
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:51,420
Do need this.

1110
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,161
We do really need this.

1111
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:56,762
It's not something that we don't really need, Mr. Strehler, it's something that we do really need.

1112
01:38:57,523 --> 01:39:02,445
You know, when you're looking at the number of draft ordinances that we've requested just since this body's met this term.

1113
01:39:02,793 --> 01:39:04,855
We're looking at nine, nine draft ordinances.

1114
01:39:04,895 --> 01:39:10,299
That's more, nine ordinances is more of a work product than we put out in a term, and I can't tell you in how long.

1115
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:15,224
If we get those draft ordinances produced to us, I guarantee you we're gonna put out a stronger work product than we have in the past.

1116
01:39:15,284 --> 01:39:22,310
If we have some council that's working for us, dedicated X amount of hours a week, putting those work products out, I guarantee you we're gonna do more work than we've done in the past.

1117
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:23,911
You are correct.

1118
01:39:23,931 --> 01:39:28,014
In all the history of Medford, we've never had legal counsel

1119
01:39:29,153 --> 01:39:30,994
for the city council.

1120
01:39:31,714 --> 01:39:33,554
And we already have a city solicitor.

1121
01:39:34,375 --> 01:39:36,895
He represents also the council.

1122
01:39:37,595 --> 01:39:38,756
He doesn't work for the mayor.

1123
01:39:39,516 --> 01:39:42,277
He works for the people and he works for the whole administration.

1124
01:39:43,057 --> 01:39:48,378
Another thing, this is presented and no cost amount is placed on it.

1125
01:39:48,439 --> 01:39:49,859
We don't know what this will cost.

1126
01:39:52,611 --> 01:39:54,132
We ought to research that first.

1127
01:39:54,832 --> 01:39:58,114
But I don't think it's needed because we already have a city solicitor.

1128
01:39:58,154 --> 01:39:59,455
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1129
01:39:59,715 --> 01:40:06,978
I think if you look at the ordinances before you, it says that the issue of funding for the City Council to hire an additional legal services line item be discussed.

1130
01:40:07,379 --> 01:40:09,880
Now, I think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that Mayor Burke

1131
01:40:10,407 --> 01:40:16,570
during this fiscal year has already committed to us $40,000 for professional and legal services in the form of a zoning consultant.

1132
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:23,453
That money's never actually been transferred into our line item for professional legal services in the city council's budget and the budget of the legislative.

1133
01:40:24,133 --> 01:40:28,215
It sits in a revolving fund for special services that lays in the auditor's office.

1134
01:40:29,654 --> 01:40:37,682
So, with that being said, you know, we already have funds that are available to us that have been committed to us and have been budgeted to us for the purposes of legal or professional technical services, Mr. President.

1135
01:40:37,702 --> 01:40:44,508
I think what we're looking at doing is figuring out a way that we can best capture these funds and start utilizing them so that we can put out a stronger work product.

1136
01:40:45,129 --> 01:40:45,990
Thank you, Counselor Knight.

1137
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:47,231
Please continue, Mr. Strong.

1138
01:40:47,251 --> 01:40:49,453
Yes, I'll end with this here.

1139
01:40:49,493 --> 01:40:53,697
In my opinion, this is another example of why taxes are increased needlessly.

1140
01:40:54,478 --> 01:40:54,758
Thank you.

1141
01:40:58,416 --> 01:41:02,220
On the motion of Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1142
01:41:06,505 --> 01:41:08,488
You're referring it to the Committee of the Whole meeting that's coming up.

1143
01:41:09,308 --> 01:41:09,829
Yes, okay.

1144
01:41:10,149 --> 01:41:15,355
So on the motion of Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Knight to refer this to the Committee of the Whole meeting with Mayor Longo Kern.

1145
01:41:15,696 --> 01:41:16,577
All those in favor?

1146
01:41:17,177 --> 01:41:17,958
All those opposed?

1147
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:19,240
The motion passes.

1148
01:41:24,229 --> 01:41:29,993
On the motion of Councilor Scott Kelly, seconded by Councilor Caviello, that we take papers under suspension.

1149
01:41:30,013 --> 01:41:30,753
All those in favor?

1150
01:41:31,233 --> 01:41:32,014
All those opposed?

1151
01:41:32,054 --> 01:41:32,935
The motion passes.

1152
01:41:32,955 --> 01:41:35,936
20-049 offered by Councilor Knight.

1153
01:41:36,377 --> 01:41:48,024
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the city administration take the necessary steps to rectify the drainage issue currently present in front of Amici's Pizzeria in West Medford Square.

1154
01:41:48,905 --> 01:41:49,345
Councilor Knight?

1155
01:41:49,758 --> 01:41:51,142
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1156
01:41:51,683 --> 01:41:54,712
Everybody that knows me knows I love my amichis.

1157
01:41:54,812 --> 01:41:57,420
Probably once a week at least, I go down to amichis and get.

1158
01:41:58,496 --> 01:42:01,897
couple slices of pizza before I make my way up here to the city council meeting.

1159
01:42:01,937 --> 01:42:08,979
I'll get two slices of cheese with that great, you know, sauce-cheese ratio and the great flop that they have down there at Amici's, Mr. President.

1160
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:24,384
But a couple weeks ago when I was getting out of my car to pick up my dinner before I came to the council meeting, I noticed that the drainage issue right in front of Amici's, recently they had a complete streets program down there and they did a bump out in the curb right where Amici's and Paul Revere's is.

1161
01:42:24,924 --> 01:42:29,152
And that bumped out, but the gradient isn't conducive to proper drainage.

1162
01:42:29,573 --> 01:42:37,446
So what's going on, Mr. President, is the water's pooling and it's becoming at least five, six, seven inches deep at some point, which renders that parking spot.

1163
01:42:39,451 --> 01:42:49,457
And that's the parking spot that sits right out in front of, you know, four businesses that specialize in takeout food, Hong Kong Village, CB Scoops, Amici's, and Paul Revere's.

1164
01:42:50,278 --> 01:42:56,462
So with that being said, Mr. President, it's having a negative impact on the businesses that worked on, that are operating down in West Bedford Square.

1165
01:42:56,602 --> 01:43:01,105
Also, when they did this complete streets project and they did put the bump out in, they took away a parking spot and a half.

1166
01:43:01,866 --> 01:43:08,310
So to add, you know, insult to injury, on top of losing a parking spot, now there's another parking spot there that is

1167
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:12,351
virtually useless to the business district in times of inclement weather.

1168
01:43:12,391 --> 01:43:26,015
So I'm asking that the engineering department take the appropriate steps to hold the contractor accountable that did the work and get them back out there to fix it so that the fine people that are trying to get a nice slice of pizza down there in West Memphis Square are able to do so, Mr. President.

1169
01:43:27,236 --> 01:43:28,196
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1170
01:43:28,976 --> 01:43:31,737
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Carriello.

1171
01:43:31,777 --> 01:43:32,657
All those in favor?

1172
01:43:33,158 --> 01:43:33,798
All those opposed?

1173
01:43:33,818 --> 01:43:34,698
The motion passes.

1174
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:38,980
Okay.

1175
01:43:41,184 --> 01:43:41,605
Records.

1176
01:43:42,146 --> 01:43:46,813
The records of the meeting of January 21st, 2020 were passed to Councilor Morrell.

1177
01:43:47,134 --> 01:43:50,079
Councilor Morrell, how did you find...

1178
01:43:52,588 --> 01:43:53,529
Those records?

1179
01:43:53,549 --> 01:43:54,630
I found them to be excellent.

1180
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:56,912
Okay.

1181
01:43:58,393 --> 01:44:04,538
Councilor Morrell has found that those records are in excellent order and ready in moves for approval.

1182
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:06,600
Seconded by Councilor Caviello.

1183
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:07,461
All those in favor?

1184
01:44:07,861 --> 01:44:08,682
All those opposed?

1185
01:44:08,762 --> 01:44:12,465
The motion passes and the records are adopted.

1186
01:44:13,986 --> 01:44:18,650
On the motion of Councilor Beers, seconded by Councilor Knight, that the meeting be adjourned.

1187
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:19,411
All those in favor?

1188
01:44:19,451 --> 01:44:20,191
All those opposed?

1189
01:44:20,251 --> 01:44:20,832
Meeting adjourned.
