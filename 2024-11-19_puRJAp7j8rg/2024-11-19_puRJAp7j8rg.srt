20
00:01:57,287 --> 00:01:58,648

00:01:58,668 --> 00:02:00,489
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I move to suspend the rules to take a paper out of order.

22
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:08,415
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to suspend the rules to take a paper out of order, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

23
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:09,196
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

24
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:10,256
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

25
00:02:11,017 --> 00:02:11,858
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

26
00:02:11,938 --> 00:02:13,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

27
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:17,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I move to take paper 2013 out of order.

28
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:19,323
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a paper that was before the council previously.

29
00:02:19,383 --> 00:02:23,226
[SPEAKER_03]: We sent it back to the mayor with a request for amendment and it has come back as

30
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:25,055
[SPEAKER_03]: The council amended it.

31
00:02:25,075 --> 00:02:32,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to ask a representative from the administration to come up and just give us a brief synopsis of the paper that's before us, and then hopefully move for a vote.

32
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

33
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:38,383
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could please have a representative from the administration.

34
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:41,624
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could please have your name and address for the record, please.

35
00:02:42,445 --> 00:02:45,346
[SPEAKER_04]: Aleesha Nunley Benjamin, Finance Director for the City of Medford.

36
00:02:45,386 --> 00:02:46,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, Honorable Councilors.

37
00:02:47,387 --> 00:02:52,090
[SPEAKER_04]: The home rule petition before you is to create a special revenue fund for our

38
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,796
[SPEAKER_04]: casino money which was amended now to be by appropriation by this honorable body.

39
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:14,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I do believe, Mr. President, that the special revenue fund was a recommendation that was made by the Division of Local Services from the Department of Revenue to establish generally accepted accounting practices on how to spend the funds that come with these host community agreements and community impact agreements.

40
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:24,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Based upon the language that's been provided to us and the review of the language that's been provided to us previously, it seems as though everything's in order and the recommendations of the council have been adopted by the administration.

41
00:03:24,839 --> 00:03:26,120
[SPEAKER_02]: As such, I'd move for approval of the paper.

42
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,960
[SPEAKER_07]: The first reading.

43
00:03:29,284 --> 00:03:31,305
[SPEAKER_02]: On the motion of- No, no, it's actually a home rule petition, it's going to the legislature.

44
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:34,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Excuse me, Councilor, Councilor Knight, can you repeat that, please?

45
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,367
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a home rule petition, so it will go to the legislature.

46
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:36,547
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

47
00:03:36,567 --> 00:03:42,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.

48
00:03:47,112 --> 00:03:47,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Bears?

49
00:03:47,853 --> 00:03:47,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

50
00:03:49,053 --> 00:03:49,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Caraviello?

51
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:50,374
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

52
00:03:50,874 --> 00:03:51,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight?

53
00:03:51,534 --> 00:03:51,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

54
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:52,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Marks?

55
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:53,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

56
00:03:53,935 --> 00:03:54,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Morell?

57
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:54,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

58
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:56,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli?

59
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:56,577
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

60
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:57,337
[SPEAKER_08]: President Falco?

61
00:03:57,357 --> 00:03:57,437
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

62
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

63
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,580
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

64
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:05,082
[SPEAKER_07]: If I may, really quick, Council Marks.

65
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:06,102
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk Hurtubise.

66
00:04:08,043 --> 00:04:09,964
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the paperwork for you to sign the petition.

67
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:15,026
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want you to sign the petition before we, if we can do that before advancing to further business.

68
00:04:16,226 --> 00:04:17,267
[SPEAKER_08]: That's acceptable to council?

69
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:18,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

70
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:25,430
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, after we've done signing, can we take paper 20-048?

71
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:26,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we can.

72
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:27,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Second.

73
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,201
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could please, the clerk will need that back.

74
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:15,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

75
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:16,041
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

76
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:45,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, while we're under suspension, petitions, presentations, and similar papers, 20-048, petition by Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, to speak on the city's zoning and discuss city's finances.

77
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:48,678
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could please have your name and address for the record, please.

78
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:54,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, my name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, and a former member of the Saugus body.

79
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,761
[SPEAKER_13]: I come here tonight

80
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:15,048
[SPEAKER_13]: To make some comments on issues that I feel are important as it relates to this upcoming budget, from what I understand this administration, and I know the Chief of Staff is here, he can reflect upon the fact that you guys and Lady are going to get an early budget this year, earlier than normal.

81
00:07:15,088 --> 00:07:16,449
[SPEAKER_13]: If that's true, I don't know.

82
00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:16,930
[SPEAKER_13]: Is it true?

83
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:18,548
[SPEAKER_13]: So he says we hope so.

84
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:29,130
[SPEAKER_13]: With that being said, and with two new Councilors on the board, I would just like to reflect upon a couple of things as it relates to what really has not been addressed for the past few months.

85
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:44,733
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, going back to last year at some point in time regarding the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, we never got a report back from the auditor's office as it relates to the outpatient surgical offices that are going to be housed

86
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:55,079
[SPEAKER_13]: in the old Lawrence Memorial Hospital as part of an addendum to the 16,000 square foot building that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to have their surgical center at.

87
00:07:55,719 --> 00:08:02,403
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that being said, again, it's just out there floating around not knowing what's going to happen because they haven't made a decision.

88
00:08:03,203 --> 00:08:07,286
[SPEAKER_13]: Second of all, it's the taxing of the nonprofit funeral portion

89
00:08:08,206 --> 00:08:14,788
[SPEAKER_13]: of the operation at the Gaffey Funeral Home, which houses the Islamic Cultural Center here in Medford.

90
00:08:15,068 --> 00:08:25,431
[SPEAKER_13]: And where they're going to be running a funeral business out of that center, once again, it presents itself as a for-profit business within the non-profit structure itself.

91
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, no answers come back on that as of yet.

92
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:34,814
[SPEAKER_13]: And these are issues that I think need to be discussed and resolved before or at least during your budget.

93
00:08:35,834 --> 00:08:43,741
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, let's go back to something that Councilor Caraviello, when he first came on to the Council, talked about, the disrepair of the schools.

94
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:50,348
[SPEAKER_13]: At that point in time, Councilor Caraviello indicated during his first term, it was $1.2 million of school repairs.

95
00:08:50,908 --> 00:09:00,917
[SPEAKER_13]: We're now in excess of $1.5 million of school repairs, and we're getting ourselves right into the same position, I shouldn't say ourselves, the city is getting itself into this position

96
00:09:01,758 --> 00:09:03,999
[SPEAKER_13]: of why we had to build new schools in the first place.

97
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:08,141
[SPEAKER_13]: If the upkeep is not going to be taking place, there is something wrong with that.

98
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:17,125
[SPEAKER_13]: The building of a new police station, contained within the building of the new police station, it's 5,000 square feet less than what was asked for.

99
00:09:17,965 --> 00:09:22,567
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no police firing range that is for qualification.

100
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:28,890
[SPEAKER_13]: But more importantly, the sad part about the whole thing, no police vehicle is going to be able to be housed internally.

101
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,251
[SPEAKER_13]: They're all going to be outside.

102
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:36,269
[SPEAKER_13]: And by doing that, all you're doing is leaving all your public service vehicles open to the elements.

103
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,533
[SPEAKER_13]: So if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be, every police officer's gonna have to go out there and take the snow off it.

104
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:53,343
[SPEAKER_13]: And you try to explain that to the people of this community and you tell them that you're spending close to $20 million for a new police station, but you have no place to house or at least care for your police cruisers.

105
00:09:54,656 --> 00:10:06,161
[SPEAKER_13]: A very important issue that seems to be lost in the weeds is the, at present, if not more, a $29 million unfunded pension liability that needs to be paid by 2029.

106
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:09,002
[SPEAKER_13]: That is yet to be discussed.

107
00:10:10,322 --> 00:10:14,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, what needs to be addressed right now also is a citywide

108
00:10:16,474 --> 00:10:20,957
[SPEAKER_13]: It's called the Citywide Home Water Meter Battery Replacement Program.

109
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:31,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Now for those of you that have a house and you know when you get your water and sewer bill, the system was put in well over 10 years ago with meters that were only good for 10 years.

110
00:10:31,523 --> 00:10:36,465
[SPEAKER_13]: The 10 years have come and gone, that's a cost factor and that's a replacement that needs to take place.

111
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:45,950
[SPEAKER_13]: We still have yet to receive a cost projection for a new fire station as to where it will be, when it will be, and what it will cost.

112
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,710
[SPEAKER_13]: There is no projections out there.

113
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:56,734
[SPEAKER_13]: And still outstanding is the new training tower that was promised it would be built before the old one was taken down.

114
00:10:57,274 --> 00:11:01,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the old one has been taken down, and now nothing has been put up.

115
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:05,838
[SPEAKER_13]: And in fact, it does affect, in the city of Method, your home insurance rates.

116
00:11:07,213 --> 00:11:12,655
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no financial outline as to how the city's annual free cash should be prioritized.

117
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:21,678
[SPEAKER_13]: For the new councils coming on board, for the last few many years, it's almost a million dollars each and every year the city of Method has left over, it just goes into free cash.

118
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:24,339
[SPEAKER_13]: So that presents itself with one or two arguments.

119
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:33,782
[SPEAKER_13]: Number one, the budget is either not accurate, or number two, that million dollars is maybe not correct when the budget is being voted upon at the time.

120
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:35,283
[SPEAKER_13]: So therefore,

121
00:11:37,506 --> 00:11:40,828
[SPEAKER_13]: To me, it makes very good sense because a lot of cities and towns do this.

122
00:11:41,488 --> 00:11:48,752
[SPEAKER_13]: You folks pass a budget in May or June, let's call it June, that should be the time you set your tax rate, not six months later.

123
00:11:49,672 --> 00:12:00,658
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you do that, you're working on an actual annual budget that reflects upon that vote that took place in June that represents itself to each and every dollar itemized.

124
00:12:02,077 --> 00:12:16,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, a public works five-year projection program that covers our streets, our sidewalks, our tree stumps, our equipment, our water repairs issues, and cemetery, as well as all personnel that's gonna be needed to address that.

125
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:28,539
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be a great program to have because number one, we're already understaffed and we're hiring immediately just two more people to work in the highway department that just basically on a daily basis is so understaffed and on demand.

126
00:12:29,895 --> 00:12:35,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Lastly, for the purposes of at least this portion of the discussion, two points.

127
00:12:36,477 --> 00:12:40,117
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know Councilor Caraviello once again has asked for this and Councilor Marks, you've asked for this.

128
00:12:40,598 --> 00:12:48,319
[SPEAKER_13]: You should get a five-year financial recap from Park Medford on all the receipts taken in and what has been given to the City of Medford.

129
00:12:48,459 --> 00:12:54,801
[SPEAKER_13]: I guarantee none of you have received anything from Park Medford as it relates to that financial responsibility.

130
00:12:55,501 --> 00:12:58,502
[SPEAKER_13]: And lastly, Councilor Marks, you brought this up, yet to be determined

131
00:12:59,182 --> 00:13:04,825
[SPEAKER_13]: Where and for what reasons has the $500,000 from Tufts University been accounted for?

132
00:13:05,185 --> 00:13:05,985
[SPEAKER_13]: You still don't know.

133
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:07,006
[SPEAKER_13]: We still don't know.

134
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:09,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Now moving over to the housing issue.

135
00:13:11,345 --> 00:13:16,387
[SPEAKER_13]: And here's an issue right now that's in the forefront of everything as to what's going on.

136
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:19,367
[SPEAKER_13]: So let's just mention a few little things that are going on.

137
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:26,249
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now what we have on the books are 185 units that are coming online after Wendy's on Middlesex Ave.

138
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,351
[SPEAKER_13]: You have 300 plus units opposite the Wellington Station.

139
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:37,553
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a proposed 400 Chapter 40B units next to the Middlesex Courthouse on Mystic Valley Parkway.

140
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:55,090
[SPEAKER_13]: And looking at the smaller neighborhood issue that took place on Forest Street, where a private developer wanted to maximize a single-family residence to a multi-family use zone, that caused a tremendous amount of consultation not only to the neighborhood, but the Medford Historical Commission.

141
00:13:56,195 --> 00:14:02,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Going back, you go to 61 Toro Street, where you had an old magnificent home over there for which Tufts University was involved.

142
00:14:03,243 --> 00:14:05,405
[SPEAKER_13]: And they sort of like wanted to take advantage of the property.

143
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:08,929
[SPEAKER_13]: But through the neighborhood pushing back, that didn't take place.

144
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:20,719
[SPEAKER_13]: Right now, as of tomorrow night, you're going to have before the Board of Appeals, where the old Titan gas station is on Boston Avenue and Harvard Street, a condominium proposed development.

145
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,341
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you have rumored development of a new condos behind the Middlesex Avenue Mall.

146
00:14:27,522 --> 00:14:32,083
[SPEAKER_13]: Once again, a rumored development of 30 plus condos on South Street.

147
00:14:32,784 --> 00:14:36,065
[SPEAKER_13]: And a rumored Boston Avenue multi-housing development.

148
00:14:38,123 --> 00:14:46,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Then, at the end of last summer, 500 multi-use development was proposed by Combined Properties of Malden.

149
00:14:47,529 --> 00:15:03,280
[SPEAKER_13]: And after a large community opposition, led by then City Councilor and now Mayor, Lungo-Koehn, as well as Gene Nuzzo and Cheryl Rodriguez, the project was forced to be scrapped by the developer.

150
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:06,142
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, some six months later,

151
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:23,252
[SPEAKER_13]: This same company, Combined Properties, is now proposing a 37, 378 residential unit, and the application for approval is coming along under a Chapter 40B proposal, entirely different than what they originally had.

152
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:31,538
[SPEAKER_13]: The real wake-up call to this whole issue right now on housing here in the City of Medford should have taken place at 61 Locust Street.

153
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:39,965
[SPEAKER_13]: The massive development that is opposite Wegmans right now, which was originally scheduled for over 500 units, and they've culled it down to 345.

154
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:44,253
[SPEAKER_13]: Neighborhood protests pushed it back.

155
00:15:45,033 --> 00:15:48,515
[SPEAKER_13]: But as in any big business development, what did they do?

156
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:58,799
[SPEAKER_13]: They went into the neighbors that were pushing back and they bought every single home over there for them to at least come back with $345,000 and still make the money that they're going to be made.

157
00:16:00,103 --> 00:16:06,985
[SPEAKER_13]: As I said some years ago, and as I said during this past campaign, the City of Medford needs to embark on a moratorium.

158
00:16:07,685 --> 00:16:14,467
[SPEAKER_13]: A moratorium on its zoning, and more importantly, a complete review of its zoning here in the City of Medford.

159
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,208
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason why the moratorium would work

160
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:21,953
[SPEAKER_13]: is because our zoning has not been reviewed for a multitude of years.

161
00:16:22,653 --> 00:16:44,343
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're saying to any proposed developer that comes in, I will propose this affordable housing, which is not the same as a Chapter 40B, because remember, affordable housing is something that's compensated in part or given great latitude by state laws, whereas a Chapter 40B is a private independent entity coming in there.

162
00:16:44,523 --> 00:16:46,644
[SPEAKER_13]: So sure, they'll give you their affordable housing.

163
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:50,586
[SPEAKER_13]: but they'll back in the cost on the remaining units that are in the building.

164
00:16:51,186 --> 00:16:54,929
[SPEAKER_13]: So how does that qualify and justify for an affordable housing process?

165
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:55,929
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know.

166
00:16:56,950 --> 00:17:03,253
[SPEAKER_13]: But also, you should be looking into what they call a growth management proposal.

167
00:17:03,934 --> 00:17:12,399
[SPEAKER_13]: And the reason why I say that is because we have right here in our own city, a sister city, it's called Malden, Massachusetts.

168
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:25,116
[SPEAKER_13]: And in 2015, they put a question on the ballot, and their ballot question revolved around what you have been talking about, Councilor Falco, the Malden Hospital, what we're going to do with it.

169
00:17:25,737 --> 00:17:30,540
[SPEAKER_13]: The second thing is the Community Preservation Act, what are we gonna do with that as far as open space?

170
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,764
[SPEAKER_13]: And their third question was the moratorium on high-density, multi-level development.

171
00:17:37,564 --> 00:17:41,987
[SPEAKER_13]: It won by 71% of the vote, and they had a moratorium,

172
00:17:43,834 --> 00:17:48,476
[SPEAKER_13]: proposal that passed and it went from January of 2016 to December of 2017.

173
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:50,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Now incorporated into that

174
00:17:56,522 --> 00:18:06,769
[SPEAKER_13]: was the density of the immediate neighborhood taken into consideration, the height, the number of units, as well as the zoning exemptions that were being challenged.

175
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:21,040
[SPEAKER_13]: And as a result of that, they have now, I think if you go to them all, then you can be able to see, if you look at their development office, I don't know if they call it Office of Community Development, they do have a serious situation where they had developers just coming in all over the place.

176
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:29,709
[SPEAKER_13]: Medford has a serious problem in having a workable business community, a business development community.

177
00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:34,591
[SPEAKER_13]: Approximately 10.2% of the business in this community is commercial.

178
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:36,552
[SPEAKER_13]: Who bears the rest of that brunt?

179
00:18:37,172 --> 00:18:38,093
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the residential.

180
00:18:38,553 --> 00:18:47,578
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know every time when you folks turn around and do your budget, you talk about a residential factor making it the highest or the lowest or whatever it might be, you're still putting the burden

181
00:18:47,998 --> 00:18:53,160
[SPEAKER_13]: on the taxpayer who owns his residential home, and you're not taking the exemption for the out-of-state person.

182
00:18:53,761 --> 00:19:07,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So, with that being said, and if we continue to go on this road, or this, how can you say, this road, so to speak, of not increasing our commercial base, all you're going to do is just going to be commercial, I mean, raising in the future your residential rate.

183
00:19:08,628 --> 00:19:16,051
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, after what took place in Malden, and after what took place after that, we can switch ourselves over to the city of,

184
00:19:16,636 --> 00:19:19,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Penta, you have one minute remaining.

185
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,476
[SPEAKER_07]: Just want to let you know.

186
00:19:21,081 --> 00:19:21,942
[SPEAKER_13]: You want somebody else to talk?

187
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:22,843
[SPEAKER_07]: No, you have 10 minutes.

188
00:19:22,863 --> 00:19:24,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Your 10 minutes is just about up.

189
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:26,505
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, well, I'm on my last page.

190
00:19:26,526 --> 00:19:27,466
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm on my last page.

191
00:19:27,526 --> 00:19:27,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, no problem.

192
00:19:27,927 --> 00:19:28,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

193
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:39,416
[SPEAKER_13]: So after Malden, beside Malden, in 2015, the city of Revere, and again in 2018, put that question of a moratorium, high density, multi-use positions over there.

194
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:47,402
[SPEAKER_13]: And their situation over there revolved itself around large scale buildings, traffic, public safety, schools, and roads were going to be at issue.

195
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:59,428
[SPEAKER_13]: And the claims that Revere was not growing geographically, but rather becoming more dense without any economic development is just like what's going on right here in our city of Method.

196
00:20:00,088 --> 00:20:04,750
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that being said, that the challenge for affordable housing in Chapter 40B as we speak today,

197
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:14,056
[SPEAKER_13]: would be the luxury of using our at-present zoning laws and skirt around the real issue of reasonably priced housing and rental.

198
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:20,780
[SPEAKER_13]: There are two or three companies in the United States that take into effect low-moderate housing.

199
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:21,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Veterans

200
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:29,542
[SPEAKER_13]: middle-income people, but not high-end middle-income people, middle-income people, and that's a determination by a professional.

201
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:52,578
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have that expertise over here, and I know on the ballot here tonight, on our agenda, there's a question regarding Chapter 40B, but if you really look at just Chapter 40B, and you realize that developer is not there to lose money, and he's putting housing in a densely populated area, you're violating all the reasoning of why a neighborhood should be a neighborhood.

202
00:20:53,438 --> 00:20:57,101
[SPEAKER_13]: And as a result of that, moratoriums does not have to go on the ballot.

203
00:20:57,602 --> 00:21:01,985
[SPEAKER_13]: A moratorium can be placed by this council, by this mayor, or jointly together.

204
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:09,592
[SPEAKER_13]: And recognizing the fact, and recognizing the fact, we are a city just as running, allowing housing to be any place and everywhere at any time.

205
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:11,834
[SPEAKER_13]: And because of that, that's not good.

206
00:21:12,054 --> 00:21:13,475
[SPEAKER_13]: That's not healthy for the neighborhood.

207
00:21:14,136 --> 00:21:18,920
[SPEAKER_13]: As I said before a long time ago, development for the sake of development isn't the best thing that can happen in this city.

208
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,262
[SPEAKER_13]: We have schools, we have public safety, we have public works.

209
00:21:22,822 --> 00:21:26,705
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a whole host of issues that taxpayers have to increasingly pay for.

210
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:33,889
[SPEAKER_13]: And our best example of that is when they talked about stations landing, that they said at that point in time, that was going to lower our tax rate.

211
00:21:33,909 --> 00:21:37,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, the tax rate has never gone down once since station landing.

212
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:39,513
[SPEAKER_13]: As a matter of fact, it just continuously goes up.

213
00:21:40,794 --> 00:21:57,560
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd be more than happy to answer any questions, but I just think it's important to have brought this up, especially for our two new councils, but more importantly for all seven of you, because this administration and you as a new council needs to address issues that basically address these matters.

214
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:07,063
[SPEAKER_13]: They haven't been addressed, and they need to be addressed, and you just can't sit here and say, okay, we'll get to it someday, because someday has already come.

215
00:22:07,983 --> 00:22:09,724
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, Mr. President,

216
00:22:11,362 --> 00:22:19,790
[SPEAKER_13]: Larry, could you, I made copies of my comments for all of your Councilors, so in case you missed anything.

217
00:22:21,869 --> 00:22:30,332
[SPEAKER_13]: The part that I appreciated the most when I served on this board for 36 years was the fact that I was willing to hear opposite viewpoints.

218
00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:34,814
[SPEAKER_13]: But when it comes to finances, two and two equals four.

219
00:22:35,534 --> 00:22:39,596
[SPEAKER_13]: And when it comes to neighborhoods, the people who live in the neighborhood should come first.

220
00:22:40,056 --> 00:22:45,618
[SPEAKER_13]: Not out-of-towners, not developers who want to come in there and make a whole bunch of money and then leave us.

221
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:48,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Perfect example is Lumineer on Locust Street.

222
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:49,980
[SPEAKER_13]: They built the building.

223
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,921
[SPEAKER_13]: They said they were going to stay there.

224
00:22:52,201 --> 00:22:54,162
[SPEAKER_13]: They went to the Board of Appeals to get what they had to.

225
00:22:54,762 --> 00:23:02,027
[SPEAKER_13]: And one year later, they sold off the building and made $62 million at the expense of the Medford taxpayer.

226
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:04,808
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I thank you for listening.

227
00:23:04,868 --> 00:23:07,470
[SPEAKER_13]: And if there's any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them.

228
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,570
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Penta.

229
00:23:09,551 --> 00:23:10,792
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions from the council?

230
00:23:13,453 --> 00:23:13,833
[SPEAKER_07]: Any questions?

231
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:16,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I ask a question?

232
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:19,637
[SPEAKER_05]: That guy there looks like Ted Cruz.

233
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,561
[SPEAKER_05]: He's got a new addition.

234
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,083
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Penta.

235
00:23:29,123 --> 00:23:31,464
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could please have your name and address for the record, please.

236
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:32,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

237
00:23:32,784 --> 00:23:37,606
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is John Starella, and I reside on Metcalfe Street here in Medford.

238
00:23:38,086 --> 00:23:44,289
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to give you my idea of what Councilor Penta referred to free cash.

239
00:23:45,209 --> 00:23:51,151
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to give you my idea of what free cash is, and I'd like to know whether or not you agree with me.

240
00:23:51,891 --> 00:23:53,792
[SPEAKER_14]: I see free cash as a slush fund.

241
00:23:54,592 --> 00:24:00,394
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, when we pass, say, for instance, an expenditure, we always overestimate it.

242
00:24:01,014 --> 00:24:09,376
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's done intentionally, because what is left over from the overestimate is put into free cash.

243
00:24:10,557 --> 00:24:11,577
[SPEAKER_14]: And that sits there.

244
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:14,058
[SPEAKER_14]: And when...

245
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:22,091
[SPEAKER_14]: the council or any councilor needs a special project, we pay for it out of free cash.

246
00:24:23,372 --> 00:24:26,794
[SPEAKER_14]: And it passes easily because it's free.

247
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:31,437
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you think of that, Mr. President?

248
00:24:32,157 --> 00:24:33,378
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think of that?

249
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:35,719
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the name is horrible that they call it free cash.

250
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:36,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing's free.

251
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,582
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I disagree with the name of it, without a doubt.

252
00:24:41,082 --> 00:24:44,044
[SPEAKER_14]: But is that the purpose of free cash, to have a slush fund?

253
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:46,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't think so, no.

254
00:24:47,255 --> 00:24:47,435
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

255
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:52,296
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's where you get your money when you have a project later on in the term.

256
00:24:52,936 --> 00:24:56,937
[SPEAKER_14]: You can take it right out of free cash and no one objects to it because it's free.

257
00:24:58,657 --> 00:24:59,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Quote, unquote.

258
00:25:00,218 --> 00:25:00,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

259
00:25:00,838 --> 00:25:01,498
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

260
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:02,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

261
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:06,679
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other questions?

262
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

263
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:18,980
[SPEAKER_17]: restricted available funds used to supplement the budget.

264
00:25:20,641 --> 00:25:21,862
[SPEAKER_02]: By definition that's what it is.

265
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:24,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

266
00:25:24,663 --> 00:25:25,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to receive and place on file.

267
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:29,807
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of council tonight, seconded by councilor Scarpelli to receive and place on file.

268
00:25:29,827 --> 00:25:30,467
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

269
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:31,708
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

270
00:25:31,748 --> 00:25:33,489
[SPEAKER_07]: The paper is received and placed on file.

271
00:25:34,142 --> 00:25:52,036
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to console Scarpelli to revert to the regular order of business second by console beers all those in favor all those opposed the motion passes to 0-0 for to offer by console morale whereas the city city of Method currently Exercises the local option for tax deferments in accordance with Mass General Law chapter 59 chapter

272
00:25:53,677 --> 00:26:02,720
[SPEAKER_07]: 5 paragraph 41 A and whereas the upper income limit set by the city of Method for eligible residents 65 and over is $20,000 per year.

273
00:26:03,321 --> 00:26:09,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council discuss raising the income limit to better reflect the cost of living and housing in Medford.

274
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:15,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell.

275
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:17,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

276
00:26:17,424 --> 00:26:18,345
[SPEAKER_16]: So I do apologize.

277
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:20,287
[SPEAKER_16]: So the current minimum for Medford is actually $40,000.

278
00:26:20,407 --> 00:26:21,909
[SPEAKER_16]: In a last session, this body

279
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:54,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Adjusted the interest rate and also at some point that cap was adjusted I found some pages on the website that need to be updated with the current cap But even at that level of $40,000 for the income cap Medford still lags behind surrounding cities in this state program So for people that don't know this is a state program that Medford takes part in that allows residents who meet certain criteria And are over the age of 65 to defer their property taxes until their house is sold or they pass away

280
00:26:56,283 --> 00:27:22,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford like every other municipality has to set an income cap on this and an interest rate as I said The interest rate was lower to 5% last session and I think the members of this body who helped to pass that But in regards to the income cap at $40,000 For context Somerville's limit is 57,000 Cambridge is 53,000 and it should be noted that both of these communities have owner occupied exemptions, which we do not have in Medford, so I

281
00:27:22,702 --> 00:27:30,424
[SPEAKER_16]: As far as kind of tools in our tools box to help people who need it to get relief from their property taxes were really limited.

282
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:39,326
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it's important that we make sure we're at the highest level allowed by the state so that as many people who do wish to take part in this program can.

283
00:27:39,486 --> 00:27:42,607
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I check with the chief assessor the city assessor.

284
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:45,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Believe only two households currently take part in the program.

285
00:27:45,448 --> 00:28:10,113
[SPEAKER_16]: So I understand it's not for everyone with the interest rates and the way the interest rate actually Changes at the time of the owner passing away or being sold But the state does allow us to raise this cap to the senior circuit breaker tax credit And I do understand that other communities rather than having to come back to this income cap time and again They're wording it such that this program is

286
00:28:10,851 --> 00:28:18,658
[SPEAKER_16]: in their city is for people who meet the requirements with income not exceeding the state cap calculated under Clause 41A of Section 5 of Chapter 59.

287
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:23,388
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's something that as the state adjusts, Medford would adjust along with it.

288
00:28:24,348 --> 00:28:48,966
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm raising this now and my motion is to send this to Committee of the Whole in either February or March so it's something that we can have the city assessor come out and explain to us how this program, if more people were to take part in this at this higher income cap or other potential caps, how it would just affect cash flow so that we can look at that during budget time as we have these,

289
00:28:49,693 --> 00:29:01,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Meetings hopefully earlier, as we discussed already in this meeting, and I'd also like to add a beat paper so that when that rate is set, this does go up as a notice in the next property tax bill.

290
00:29:02,483 --> 00:29:07,927
[SPEAKER_16]: The deadline to apply for this program is April 1st, so it would be hard for this.

291
00:29:08,027 --> 00:29:10,509
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't do it this time around, but knowing when this rate is set.

292
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:17,090
[SPEAKER_16]: just so people are aware of this program because it is a program from the state that people around the state take part in.

293
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,932
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to make sure that Medford residents do know about it.

294
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:23,234
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

295
00:29:23,915 --> 00:29:28,118
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could, um, if you could just help with the clerk, if you could give him the wording to the B paper.

296
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:29,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

297
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so when this, when we set or

298
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:45,763
[SPEAKER_16]: Whether we stay with the current cap, if we pick a new cap, whatever it is, after we have this committee of the whole, that we include a notice of this program the next time property tax bills are sent out.

299
00:29:57,751 --> 00:29:57,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

300
00:30:02,612 --> 00:30:03,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Would you like to make a comment?

301
00:30:03,853 --> 00:30:05,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

302
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:10,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, William Navarre, Apartment 1B, Medford Street.

303
00:30:11,918 --> 00:30:14,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, 108 Medford Street, Apartment 1B.

304
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:20,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to speak a little bit about this and how it relates to the philosophy of taxation.

305
00:30:21,104 --> 00:30:27,369
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to say that land is opportunity and taxes on land are therefore taxes on opportunity.

306
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:36,733
[SPEAKER_01]: But unlike most taxes, which are only paid when the opportunity is exploited, taxes on land are paid whether the opportunities are squandered or exploited.

307
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:46,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Taxes on land, therefore, discourage folks buying up land in order to charge a high price to future folks wanting to access the opportunities available on it.

308
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:57,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Real estate taxes are the only tax I know of in the Commonwealth that tax land at all, and they are therefore the best type of tax collected in this Commonwealth.

309
00:30:59,241 --> 00:31:07,712
[SPEAKER_01]: But those who support taxes on land have, for over 100 years, been thought to be on a mission to tax elderly widows out of their homes.

310
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:10,756
[SPEAKER_01]: In 1909, Winston Churchill had already heard it a million times.

311
00:31:11,397 --> 00:31:16,184
[SPEAKER_01]: You might not be aware that Winston Churchill supported the form of taxation I've been advocating to you guys.

312
00:31:18,561 --> 00:31:23,126
[SPEAKER_01]: He said then that the personality of the widow has been used to exhaustion.

313
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:30,914
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be sweating in the cruelest sense of the word, over time of the grossest description, to bring the widow out again so soon.

314
00:31:31,494 --> 00:31:32,976
[SPEAKER_01]: She must have a rest for a bit.

315
00:31:34,698 --> 00:31:39,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, since I'm advocating for that form of text, I feel this is a really good opportunity

316
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:46,980
[SPEAKER_01]: to rise in support of the deferral programs in the strongest possible terms and support increasing its income limits.

317
00:31:47,681 --> 00:31:54,973
[SPEAKER_01]: This proposal will allow our seniors to age in place and enjoy their homes if that's what they choose, not tax widows out of their homes.

318
00:31:56,684 --> 00:32:01,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And this I should make very clear I understand is not a handout of any kind to our seniors.

319
00:32:01,268 --> 00:32:04,110
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not even a social safety net or a form of charity.

320
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:12,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Seniors are still well incentivized to downsize their land use if they wish to leave a larger estate to their heirs.

321
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:24,208
[SPEAKER_01]: The tax deferrals merely give seniors more flexibility on how to use the assets that they have worked hard to build up over the years by paying their taxes deferred with their property.

322
00:32:25,939 --> 00:32:38,561
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope the seniors who are able to remain in our community under the deferment program will remain allies in my calls for more intensive land use that will provide access to urban opportunities for people of all ages as our city grows.

323
00:32:39,321 --> 00:32:46,783
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they'll support my calls for higher taxes on land and lower taxes on buildings, and that they'll support my calls for fewer parking mandates.

324
00:32:47,283 --> 00:32:53,984
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to reiterate, in the strongest possible terms, that I support tax deferral programs and I do not hope for increased

325
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:57,665
[SPEAKER_01]: land taxes or real estate taxes to tax anyone out of their homes.

326
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

327
00:32:58,706 --> 00:32:59,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

328
00:33:00,046 --> 00:33:00,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

329
00:33:02,287 --> 00:33:03,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

330
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:17,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, possible and also making sure that with only two households using this, I mean, that might be that people don't want to.

331
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:21,074
[SPEAKER_10]: My people be that people don't know that the cap was raised to 40,000 recently.

332
00:33:21,114 --> 00:33:23,215
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a lot of information questions there.

333
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:23,435
[SPEAKER_10]: So

334
00:33:24,413 --> 00:33:26,994
[SPEAKER_10]: I just strongly support this motion and the B paper.

335
00:33:27,875 --> 00:33:28,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

336
00:33:29,095 --> 00:33:29,655
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

337
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:31,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

338
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:47,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Last term when this council did adopt the increase from $20,000 to $40,000, which passed unanimously before the body, we raised a question to the city assessor asking her to conduct a cost analysis and feasibility study of adopting the state maximum.

339
00:33:48,242 --> 00:33:52,764
[SPEAKER_02]: She reported back to us, I believe, right around the time we were setting the tax rate.

340
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:54,979
[SPEAKER_02]: that she was still working on that document.

341
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:07,711
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd just like to add the paper that the council had adopted back in March of 2019, I'm sorry, May of 2019, I believe it was either the 20th or the 28th in that meeting, making that request.

342
00:34:08,192 --> 00:34:17,781
[SPEAKER_02]: And add that to the agenda as part of the discussion, Mr. President, because if we're going to make a decision about this type of issue that's going to have a certain impact on our finances here in the community,

343
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:26,483
[SPEAKER_02]: then at the very least we need to have a feasibility study or a cost impact analysis done so that we have an understanding of what impact it's going to have on the bottom line in the community.

344
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:27,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.

345
00:34:27,723 --> 00:34:28,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

346
00:34:29,164 --> 00:34:30,404
[SPEAKER_02]: So my motion would be to join that paper.

347
00:34:30,844 --> 00:34:31,705
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

348
00:34:33,285 --> 00:34:33,785
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to join?

349
00:34:34,086 --> 00:34:35,206
[SPEAKER_02]: To include it as part of the meeting.

350
00:34:35,386 --> 00:34:43,229
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't necessarily have to be joined to this paper tonight, but when the meeting is conducted, that it's conducted when we have the cost analysis and feasibility study.

351
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:43,749
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, okay.

352
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

353
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:46,282
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks.

354
00:34:47,223 --> 00:34:48,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you Mr. President.

355
00:34:48,063 --> 00:34:50,306
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Councilor Morell for bringing this up.

356
00:34:51,427 --> 00:34:59,134
[SPEAKER_15]: I remember last year's discussions and at the time I believe it was two or three people that took advantage of the tax deferral program.

357
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:15,492
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the time when we were discussing of raising the income levels and also lowering the interest rate, we thought by taking a step by lowering it from 8% to 5%, we'd see if we attracted more people.

358
00:35:15,793 --> 00:35:20,454
[SPEAKER_15]: Was that more attractive to people that possibly wanted to do a deferral?

359
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:25,496
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's too soon to tell now, but over the next several months,

360
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:28,577
[SPEAKER_15]: We should see if that was somewhat successful.

361
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:33,839
[SPEAKER_15]: And I agree the next logical step is increasing the income levels.

362
00:35:34,299 --> 00:35:35,180
[SPEAKER_15]: So I agree with that.

363
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,523
[SPEAKER_15]: I also want to put out there that this is one of several programs that seniors could take advantage of.

364
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:48,238
[SPEAKER_15]: The other program that we have is the state circuit breaker tax credit program.

365
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,340
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's been around for a number of years.

366
00:35:50,921 --> 00:35:53,443
[SPEAKER_15]: It's 100% through the state.

367
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,865
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's not a city run program.

368
00:35:56,686 --> 00:36:05,093
[SPEAKER_15]: And based on how it works is when your tax bill exceeds 10% of your total income, you qualify.

369
00:36:06,343 --> 00:36:11,207
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's 10% of your total income, you qualify this for this particular program.

370
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:17,011
[SPEAKER_15]: And for the tax year 2019, the amount that you would qualify for is $1,130.

371
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:18,012
[SPEAKER_15]: So if any senior out there,

372
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:27,297
[SPEAKER_15]: is interested, you have to apply for it when you do your taxes, which are coming up.

373
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:29,037
[SPEAKER_15]: This is an ideal time to do it.

374
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:32,538
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's when you would apply for this through the state.

375
00:36:32,998 --> 00:36:34,859
[SPEAKER_15]: And you would have to follow their rules and regulations.

376
00:36:35,219 --> 00:36:42,541
[SPEAKER_15]: But that more or less is, in a nutshell, how do you apply for it and who's eligible.

377
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:51,524
[SPEAKER_15]: The other one is the regular statutory exemptions that we have currently in this city right now for, I believe, veterans, disabled, the blind,

378
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:53,453
[SPEAKER_15]: and also seniors.

379
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:54,515
[SPEAKER_15]: And there may be another one.

380
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:56,879
[SPEAKER_15]: I think there may be five or six exemptions.

381
00:36:57,503 --> 00:37:10,868
[SPEAKER_15]: And the one that I'm speaking about, Mr. President, this council back many years ago, through my resolution, lowered the age from 70 to 65, which actually helped thousands of people take advantage of it, that five-year gap.

382
00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:16,190
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's something I'm proud of that we did many, many years ago to help seniors in this community.

383
00:37:17,031 --> 00:37:21,092
[SPEAKER_15]: But the senior exemption, Mr. President, and this is something we have to look up.

384
00:37:21,192 --> 00:37:22,673
[SPEAKER_15]: It's set up statutorily.

385
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:36,193
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can't raise the income levels, but we can ask our state delegation, which we ask a lot of things, if they would look at it on a state level, Mr. President, because depending on where you live,

386
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,341
[SPEAKER_15]: in Massachusetts, these income levels are way out of whack.

387
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:50,944
[SPEAKER_15]: So for instance, your income to be eligible for the senior statutory property tax exemption is not to exceed $24,758 if you're single or $37,137 if you're married.

388
00:38:01,035 --> 00:38:08,282
[SPEAKER_15]: So those are the two income levels that you can't exceed to be currently eligible for a $1,000 exemption in the city of Method.

389
00:38:09,244 --> 00:38:18,109
[SPEAKER_15]: The one nice thing about this program is we get paid for a portion of what we give in exemption back by the state through our cherry sheets.

390
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:20,431
[SPEAKER_15]: So we actually get something in back.

391
00:38:20,451 --> 00:38:23,452
[SPEAKER_15]: So actually, we should be promoting this for our seniors.

392
00:38:24,013 --> 00:38:27,435
[SPEAKER_15]: They're getting $1,000, and we're also getting somewhat reimbursed.

393
00:38:27,715 --> 00:38:31,257
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're not fully losing out the $1,000 on our tax roll.

394
00:38:31,597 --> 00:38:35,780
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a win-win for the resident and also for the city, Mr. President.

395
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:40,262
[SPEAKER_15]: And also, there's the income level I just mentioned.

396
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:53,609
[SPEAKER_15]: And regarding estates, you cannot exceed, if you're single, $40,000 in estate revenue or worth and $55,000 for married.

397
00:38:54,449 --> 00:38:56,310
[SPEAKER_15]: And this does not count your domicile.

398
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,851
[SPEAKER_15]: So it does not count where you live.

399
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:03,134
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you have other assets and so forth that are above the $40,000 for single and $55,000, that's also another criteria.

400
00:39:06,001 --> 00:39:17,246
[SPEAKER_15]: But this program, I believe hundreds of Medford residents, I can't remember the last count, take advantage of this program every year, Mr. President, and count on it because of the way taxes are going up.

401
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:19,427
[SPEAKER_15]: But as I mentioned at the beginning, $24,000.

402
00:39:19,587 --> 00:39:28,050
[SPEAKER_15]: If someone's making $24,000 and they want to rent in the city of Method, you wouldn't be renting in the city of Method.

403
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,552
[SPEAKER_15]: You wouldn't be able to afford anything else but possibly your rent.

404
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:35,022
[SPEAKER_15]: So these numbers are way out of whack.

405
00:39:35,062 --> 00:39:41,786
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe if you're living out in Fall River or maybe in Springfield, that may swing it for a single person out there.

406
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:42,526
[SPEAKER_15]: Who knows?

407
00:39:42,586 --> 00:39:43,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe not.

408
00:39:43,827 --> 00:39:45,728
[SPEAKER_15]: But around here, it doesn't, Mr. President.

409
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:53,893
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would ask that we as a council, because this has been an issue for years, and it does go up incrementally every year.

410
00:39:54,753 --> 00:40:00,115
[SPEAKER_15]: So it went up from last year, it was 24,000, it might have been 24,100 rather than 24,700.

411
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:18,403
[SPEAKER_15]: So it does go up a certain percentage every year, but it's not enough to be eligible to the masses, which I think in this day and age we all want to get to because many seniors like my mother and many other mothers in here, they may be property rich, but they're money poor.

412
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:22,171
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't have the fluidity of having money.

413
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:29,977
[SPEAKER_15]: They have a house that's worth something they bought years and years ago, but they don't have the cash to pay for the taxes and everything else that goes up.

414
00:40:30,237 --> 00:40:33,080
[SPEAKER_15]: The cable bill and you name it, everything goes up every year.

415
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:41,846
[SPEAKER_15]: So these are important things that seniors that are low income, seniors in our community need to take advantage.

416
00:40:42,187 --> 00:40:48,732
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we can do anything, like Councilor Morell mentioned, about increasing the income and asset levels,

417
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:50,853
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we should be promoting that.

418
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:52,314
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want to thank the Council.

419
00:40:53,014 --> 00:40:53,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

420
00:40:58,878 --> 00:41:00,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Please have your name and address for the record, please.

421
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:03,220
[SPEAKER_14]: John Stirella of Metcalfe Street.

422
00:41:03,981 --> 00:41:05,001
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

423
00:41:05,261 --> 00:41:12,525
[SPEAKER_14]: And I want to tell Councilor Morell that I do support your resolution.

424
00:41:15,027 --> 00:41:18,409
[SPEAKER_14]: But I would like, if you can, to quantify it for me.

425
00:41:20,754 --> 00:41:21,955
[SPEAKER_14]: as it stands today.

426
00:41:22,455 --> 00:41:26,117
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, as it's practiced today, can you quantify it?

427
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:29,239
[SPEAKER_14]: What is it costing?

428
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:37,445
[SPEAKER_14]: In other words, well, I've heard that only six people are in the program.

429
00:41:37,865 --> 00:41:38,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that true?

430
00:41:38,906 --> 00:41:43,809
[SPEAKER_16]: I heard, the number I got from the assessor this week was two households.

431
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:44,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Two.

432
00:41:45,009 --> 00:41:45,730
[SPEAKER_14]: I beg your pardon?

433
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:46,030
[SPEAKER_14]: Two.

434
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:46,210
[SPEAKER_14]: Two.

435
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:48,211
[SPEAKER_14]: There are only two people in the program?

436
00:41:48,231 --> 00:41:48,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Two households, yeah.

437
00:41:50,353 --> 00:41:52,454
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what are we talking about here?

438
00:41:53,034 --> 00:41:58,017
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, the average tax, say, is $6,000 a year.

439
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:03,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, as I understand, this counts somewhere else as a deferment, right?

440
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,802
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, deferment means you pay nothing, right?

441
00:42:06,822 --> 00:42:08,263
[SPEAKER_14]: It defers the whole cost.

442
00:42:08,323 --> 00:42:08,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

443
00:42:09,724 --> 00:42:11,745
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, this comes only to, say, $6,000, $6,000 on an average.

444
00:42:11,765 --> 00:42:13,125
[SPEAKER_14]: $12,000 is what we're talking about.

445
00:42:18,164 --> 00:42:32,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, when you shift that, say, for instance, to the rest of the population, pardon me, when you shift that to the rest of the population, there are 17,000 parcels.

446
00:42:34,528 --> 00:42:45,490
[SPEAKER_14]: You divide the 17,000 into the 12,000, and you get the added cost to the rest of the population of something like a dollar a year.

447
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:47,903
[SPEAKER_14]: This is ridiculous.

448
00:42:47,963 --> 00:42:53,227
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about a dollar a year to 17,000 people in the city.

449
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:55,328
[SPEAKER_14]: They'll gladly pay it.

450
00:42:56,969 --> 00:42:58,390
[SPEAKER_14]: But this amounts to nothing.

451
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:02,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, when you consider that we have a $183 million budget, right?

452
00:43:02,393 --> 00:43:03,694
[SPEAKER_14]: But we don't spend $183 million, do we?

453
00:43:13,459 --> 00:43:15,520
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we spend more.

454
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,281
[SPEAKER_14]: We spend something like $200 million, and we do that every year.

455
00:43:22,082 --> 00:43:28,464
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know why this subject is even brought up, because it amounts to nothing, nothing at all.

456
00:43:30,185 --> 00:43:31,425
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see it improved.

457
00:43:31,485 --> 00:43:33,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Consular Marks.

458
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,382
[SPEAKER_15]: I can hear what Dr. Streller is mentioning.

459
00:43:38,422 --> 00:43:55,353
[SPEAKER_15]: At this point, because there's only two households taking advantage of this, what we're trying to do, doctor, is increase the number of participants by lowering the interest rate from 8% to 5%, making it more attractive, by increasing the income levels to make it more attractive.

460
00:43:55,913 --> 00:44:00,216
[SPEAKER_15]: And by the way, that dollar a piece that you're talking about,

461
00:44:01,417 --> 00:44:07,562
[SPEAKER_15]: has to be realized every year, but we're also getting an interest off this.

462
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:19,473
[SPEAKER_15]: So the people that are doing the deferment, if you have roughly an $8,000 tax rate, you're going to be paying $400 eventually when you settle up on that every year.

463
00:44:21,474 --> 00:44:23,876
[SPEAKER_15]: So really, it's going to come back.

464
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:32,313
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not really paid out by the people that aren't taking the deferment because we're gonna get it back through the deferral.

465
00:44:33,134 --> 00:44:35,675
[SPEAKER_15]: But what we're trying to do is increase the number of people.

466
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:40,176
[SPEAKER_15]: So right now, you're right, it's marginal because there's only two people taking advantage.

467
00:44:40,476 --> 00:44:42,657
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's not the intent, to keep it marginal.

468
00:44:42,897 --> 00:44:47,038
[SPEAKER_14]: It is, but even if you increase it by 100%, now you'll have four people on it.

469
00:44:49,399 --> 00:44:51,140
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, this is a ridiculous discussion.

470
00:44:52,168 --> 00:44:53,729
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's dispense with it.

471
00:44:54,630 --> 00:45:14,802
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do agree with you that, when you gave your example about senior citizens who are house rich but dollar poor, well, that's the reason I think that this council must definitely put in a tax reduction this year.

472
00:45:16,223 --> 00:45:18,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Now our tax comes to,

473
00:45:22,045 --> 00:45:28,468
[SPEAKER_14]: My God, my mind is... What is our tax now?

474
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:29,709
[SPEAKER_14]: It's... 9.15.

475
00:45:29,889 --> 00:45:35,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, well, that's the rate.

476
00:45:35,312 --> 00:45:37,613
[SPEAKER_12]: But I was thinking that the tax should be reduced from...

477
00:45:53,062 --> 00:45:53,863
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my God.

478
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,285
[SPEAKER_14]: You see what you guys got to look forward to?

479
00:46:01,487 --> 00:46:02,128
[SPEAKER_14]: But anyway.

480
00:46:03,115 --> 00:46:09,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Our tax should be reduced, I say, to 14, like we're paying now $18,000.

481
00:46:10,742 --> 00:46:13,484
[SPEAKER_14]: It should be reduced to $14,000.

482
00:46:14,244 --> 00:46:17,928
[SPEAKER_14]: And not only that, if we reduce the taxes, now you must consider this.

483
00:46:18,188 --> 00:46:21,290
[SPEAKER_14]: This is very important because you've got to do this before June 30th.

484
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:23,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, we know what's going to happen.

485
00:46:23,592 --> 00:46:26,034
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to be presented with a tax.

486
00:46:27,139 --> 00:46:29,481
[SPEAKER_14]: On June 29th, you've got to pass it in a hurry.

487
00:46:29,922 --> 00:46:34,566
[SPEAKER_14]: You're not going to consider the only power you have, which is to reduce taxes.

488
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,847
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's what you must do.

489
00:46:36,747 --> 00:46:41,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Because reducing taxes will increase revenue.

490
00:46:41,812 --> 00:46:43,333
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, that sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

491
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:47,817
[SPEAKER_14]: But that's what the federal government did, right?

492
00:46:48,778 --> 00:46:51,160
[SPEAKER_14]: The federal government reduced taxes, right?

493
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,181
[SPEAKER_14]: And guess what?

494
00:46:52,611 --> 00:46:55,552
[SPEAKER_14]: revenue increase because other taxes are paid.

495
00:46:56,172 --> 00:46:58,814
[SPEAKER_14]: When consumers have more money, they spend more money.

496
00:46:58,854 --> 00:47:03,535
[SPEAKER_14]: When they spend more money, that increases other taxes, and that's what will happen to us.

497
00:47:04,336 --> 00:47:09,498
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've got to reduce taxes, and that's the way we'll help people like your mother.

498
00:47:11,959 --> 00:47:13,079
[SPEAKER_14]: If you reduce taxes.

499
00:47:13,139 --> 00:47:22,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, this tax reduction is so successful that within the next 90 days, the president is considering reducing federal taxes again.

500
00:47:24,264 --> 00:47:25,985
[SPEAKER_14]: He expects to get more revenue from that.

501
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:32,690
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I hope you consider this very, very carefully.

502
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:36,053
[SPEAKER_14]: You must not, again, increase taxes.

503
00:47:36,593 --> 00:47:43,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Because when you look at this agenda here, practically every one of these resolutions is a tax increase.

504
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:49,603
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, for instance, I was talking to one of the councilors here about these bins.

505
00:47:51,152 --> 00:47:54,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, what he wants to do, he wants to charge a fee for having a bin.

506
00:47:55,713 --> 00:47:56,833
[SPEAKER_14]: That fee is a tax.

507
00:47:57,093 --> 00:47:57,874
[SPEAKER_14]: Here we go again.

508
00:47:58,394 --> 00:48:01,014
[SPEAKER_14]: And that tax translates into revenue.

509
00:48:02,835 --> 00:48:04,295
[SPEAKER_14]: And the council loves the revenue.

510
00:48:05,395 --> 00:48:16,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the revenue is how we pay all of the 80%, by the way, 80% of our revenue is spent on compensation.

511
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:21,579
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole thing has to be reconsidered.

512
00:48:21,939 --> 00:48:30,445
[SPEAKER_14]: But, believe it or not, as ironic as it sounds, a tax reduction will help the people of Medford.

513
00:48:31,105 --> 00:48:35,248
[SPEAKER_14]: The people of Medford who we all want to serve, right?

514
00:48:36,108 --> 00:48:37,689
[SPEAKER_14]: And many of us would do it for nothing.

515
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:40,071
[SPEAKER_14]: We'd be happy to do it for nothing.

516
00:48:41,091 --> 00:48:41,652
[SPEAKER_14]: And we do it.

517
00:48:42,192 --> 00:48:43,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Many of us do that.

518
00:48:44,273 --> 00:48:45,454
[SPEAKER_14]: We give to the people.

519
00:48:47,015 --> 00:48:48,376
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't expect compensation.

520
00:48:49,195 --> 00:48:49,835
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't want them.

521
00:48:50,936 --> 00:48:53,617
[SPEAKER_14]: And many people have served.

522
00:48:53,757 --> 00:48:55,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Many people have put their lives at risk.

523
00:48:57,618 --> 00:49:04,641
[SPEAKER_14]: Who would put his life at risk and then not even get paid adequately for it?

524
00:49:06,962 --> 00:49:11,144
[SPEAKER_14]: I remember when I was in the service, I was paid $80 as an ensign.

525
00:49:11,164 --> 00:49:11,564
[SPEAKER_14]: And that $80,

526
00:49:18,891 --> 00:49:20,391
[SPEAKER_14]: was not every week.

527
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:22,812
[SPEAKER_14]: It was every two weeks.

528
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:25,333
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was getting $160 a month.

529
00:49:26,093 --> 00:49:26,953
[SPEAKER_14]: I was happy to get it.

530
00:49:27,753 --> 00:49:28,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

531
00:49:30,154 --> 00:49:30,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

532
00:49:31,014 --> 00:49:32,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record, please.

533
00:49:37,576 --> 00:49:41,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Andrew Castagnetti, Cushman Street, East Medford, Massachusetts.

534
00:49:42,517 --> 00:49:45,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Not to put words in my friend, Dr. Starella,

535
00:49:47,236 --> 00:49:57,181
[SPEAKER_12]: in his repertoire of words, but I think he's implying if you walk the streets, we'll tax your feet, because I'm the tax man, quote the Beatles.

536
00:50:00,082 --> 00:50:12,628
[SPEAKER_12]: First of all, I want to thank Councilor Morell, Councilor Marks, and others, and ex-Councilor Penta for bringing up this housing and affordability situation the way I'm comprehending it.

537
00:50:13,331 --> 00:50:20,994
[SPEAKER_12]: And Councilor Marks brought up a good point that I found out about 20 years ago when my mother was doing income taxes.

538
00:50:21,714 --> 00:50:26,956
[SPEAKER_12]: And he brought up, I believe it's actually called a circuit breaker under the Massachusetts income tax.

539
00:50:28,096 --> 00:50:31,437
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of people don't know about this.

540
00:50:32,337 --> 00:50:36,959
[SPEAKER_12]: And believe it or not, some accountants that do taxes don't know about it also.

541
00:50:37,819 --> 00:50:40,300
[SPEAKER_12]: Scary thought, but I've caught a few of them.

542
00:50:42,649 --> 00:51:05,892
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe the formula is, on a Massachusetts return, they take your real estate tax and your water bill, or a portion thereof, and they take 10% of your adjusted gross income, and then they do the mathematics, and if you're above, in other words, you're hurting, you would get dollar for dollar, mind you.

543
00:51:06,713 --> 00:51:10,355
[SPEAKER_12]: up to the max of, like you said, about $1,100, I guess it is.

544
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:12,877
[SPEAKER_12]: Haven't looked at it since my mother's been gone for years.

545
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:14,958
[SPEAKER_12]: But thank you for bringing that up.

546
00:51:15,058 --> 00:51:32,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, what you failed to mention was, it not only applies to people who pay real estate taxes in houses that they live in, it also applies to renters, which I was surprised to read in the law, unless the law has changed since 12 years ago.

547
00:51:34,278 --> 00:51:55,674
[SPEAKER_12]: However, in Andrew's gut opinion, there's only one surefire way to help the owner-occupied people that live in their houses in Medford is to adopt the Commonwealth of Massachusetts owner-occupied real estate tax exemption.

548
00:51:56,355 --> 00:52:01,899
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's called, if you want to look it up, Chapter 59, Section 5C.

549
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,801
[SPEAKER_12]: And in my estimation,

550
00:52:04,807 --> 00:52:14,676
[SPEAKER_12]: The average owner, average I'm saying, would save about $2,000 a year off their real estate tax bill.

551
00:52:15,617 --> 00:52:17,558
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been asking for nine and a half years.

552
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,221
[SPEAKER_12]: It will be done someday.

553
00:52:20,241 --> 00:52:21,422
[SPEAKER_12]: I may not see it.

554
00:52:22,943 --> 00:52:25,305
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it's done, it's in perpetuity.

555
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:30,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record.

556
00:52:31,465 --> 00:52:34,847
[SPEAKER_01]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

557
00:52:36,308 --> 00:52:41,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard some mention of the Laffer curve, which is the name of the curve that you can reduce the tax rate.

558
00:52:41,831 --> 00:52:45,153
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll have more economic activity going on, and then your revenue will go up.

559
00:52:45,193 --> 00:52:46,313
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called the Laffer curve.

560
00:52:46,353 --> 00:52:49,275
[SPEAKER_01]: It was put forth during the Reagan administration.

561
00:52:49,315 --> 00:52:55,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's been some debate on whether or not it's true in the federal tax regime that we have.

562
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:58,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the economists go back and forth on that.

563
00:53:00,916 --> 00:53:06,921
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could probably invite the council to guess one area where we're very certain the Laffer curve does not apply.

564
00:53:06,941 --> 00:53:10,004
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be land.

565
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:15,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Will Rogers said, buy land, they ain't making any more of it.

566
00:53:16,469 --> 00:53:21,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the fact is, if you raise the tax on land, nobody's going to destroy it either in order to avoid having to pay the tax.

567
00:53:22,363 --> 00:53:27,864
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a nice building, somebody jacks up the tax rate, maybe you'll pull the building down, you won't have to pay the tax no more.

568
00:53:27,884 --> 00:53:29,065
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't pull land down.

569
00:53:29,705 --> 00:53:31,365
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't build land, you can't create it.

570
00:53:31,405 --> 00:53:34,466
[SPEAKER_01]: It's impossible for the owner to create or destroy to affect the amount they're paying.

571
00:53:34,486 --> 00:53:38,927
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you shift the tax to land, it'd be very similar to that.

572
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:41,488
[SPEAKER_01]: People make the place better, they'll build more buildings.

573
00:53:43,108 --> 00:53:46,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford will be a better place to live, the land will become more valuable, you can tax it more.

574
00:53:47,678 --> 00:53:52,462
[SPEAKER_01]: The Laffer Curve cannot possibly apply to land, because it's perfectly inelastic good.

575
00:53:53,783 --> 00:53:56,746
[SPEAKER_01]: It cannot be created or destroyed by us mere mortals.

576
00:53:57,066 --> 00:53:59,969
[SPEAKER_01]: It was created by nature, and we're kind of stuck with the amount we have.

577
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:02,631
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one reason you should tax land.

578
00:54:02,911 --> 00:54:03,572
[SPEAKER_01]: No Laffer Curve.

579
00:54:03,712 --> 00:54:03,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

580
00:54:04,332 --> 00:54:04,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

581
00:54:08,956 --> 00:54:10,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record.

582
00:54:10,898 --> 00:54:11,939
[SPEAKER_00]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

583
00:54:14,997 --> 00:54:21,759
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you guys an analogy, and I think this is a great idea, but it's the equivalent of putting a bucket under a flood.

584
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:30,623
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a deluge of water, you want to turn off the source or turn down the source to help alleviate what the issue is.

585
00:54:31,638 --> 00:54:37,943
[SPEAKER_00]: We continue to look at, and it's admirable for the short term, but it doesn't resolve the issue for the long term.

586
00:54:38,003 --> 00:54:40,986
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does is turn our government into a bank.

587
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:53,496
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're saying to people, if you owe money and you can't pay it, we'll alleviate that debt temporarily by way of deferment and charge you 5% interest or 8% interest.

588
00:54:53,576 --> 00:54:56,278
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now we're a bank as well.

589
00:54:56,698 --> 00:54:58,500
[SPEAKER_00]: If we look at how

590
00:54:59,153 --> 00:55:13,926
[SPEAKER_00]: we are planning our city and assure that we are doing things to increase our commercial tax base, what we are doing is creating new revenues of income stream so that we don't have to continue to increase real estate.

591
00:55:14,666 --> 00:55:36,427
[SPEAKER_00]: And I strongly object to the idea that we should tax land so that it's more valuable, because increasing the value of real estate is everything that is wrong with the housing market and is the core problem of why housing is so unaffordable, because it's become an investment opportunity and ceased to be a place where people live.

592
00:55:37,148 --> 00:55:52,644
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look back in years past, when real estate was divided between commercial, which was investment opportunity, and residential, which was a place where you lived, housing was not inflated the way it is now.

593
00:55:53,044 --> 00:55:58,509
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would caution you that when we talk about these academic things, you should look at how

594
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:00,871
[SPEAKER_00]: things have come to pass.

595
00:56:01,411 --> 00:56:20,901
[SPEAKER_00]: And inflating the cost of land does nothing to help keep elderly people in their home or marginalized people in their home or allow for opportunities to people to be able to afford a piece of property or an apartment or a condo if they so choose to purchase into that American dream.

596
00:56:21,761 --> 00:56:23,022
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that said, I would

597
00:56:24,162 --> 00:56:40,993
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, laud the fact that we're looking at these things, but we really should be thinking about the source too, and it starts with really good and solid urban planning that takes into consideration those multiple avenues that afford us the opportunity to balance for our residents their real estate tax.

598
00:56:41,433 --> 00:56:41,754
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

599
00:56:42,154 --> 00:56:42,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

600
00:56:45,036 --> 00:56:45,596
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna be quick.

601
00:56:46,176 --> 00:56:46,937
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.

602
00:56:47,257 --> 00:56:49,178
[SPEAKER_01]: 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

603
00:56:51,314 --> 00:56:54,197
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to clarify, because that was a great point.

604
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:55,478
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really excited to hear it.

605
00:56:56,999 --> 00:57:13,153
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a slight difference when we talk about land between price and value, because the price of a land is the, we want that to be low, because the price represents the,

606
00:57:15,356 --> 00:57:26,563
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, capitalized value of the residual, that is the rent of the land minus the tax, gets capitalized into a price, all right?

607
00:57:26,583 --> 00:57:38,950
[SPEAKER_01]: So the price of the land refers to that, the value of land actually refers to the rent of the land, and that is the difference, how productive the land is, how useful it is, how much of a blessing it is to whoever gets to occupy it.

608
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:50,119
[SPEAKER_01]: That's different from the price of the lead, which represents the value that if you were to sell it today, sell the right to that lead into perpetuity.

609
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:53,080
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the piece you're investing on.

610
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I totally agree.

611
00:57:56,789 --> 00:57:59,229
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not want to increase the price of the land.

612
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:07,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Increasing the sale price of the land is the exact opposite of what a land value tax does, and is the exact opposite of what real estate taxes do.

613
00:58:07,971 --> 00:58:08,391
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that.

614
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:12,992
[SPEAKER_01]: If you raise any of the taxes on the real estate, on the land, whatever, the price goes down.

615
00:58:13,392 --> 00:58:14,552
[SPEAKER_01]: We want the price to go down.

616
00:58:14,572 --> 00:58:17,973
[SPEAKER_01]: That's distinct from what we mean when we say the value goes up.

617
00:58:18,193 --> 00:58:19,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are two different ideas.

618
00:58:19,493 --> 00:58:20,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Because value is based on location.

619
00:58:20,913 --> 00:58:23,334
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make the location better, the value goes up.

620
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:26,034
[SPEAKER_01]: But the price doesn't have to if the taxes also go up.

621
00:58:27,108 --> 00:58:27,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

622
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,870
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have two papers before us right now.

623
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:37,356
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record.

624
00:58:37,376 --> 00:58:39,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Robert Penta, 0 Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

625
00:58:40,078 --> 00:58:43,741
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm really getting confused on this whole issue right now, because I thought.

626
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:49,025
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, honestly, I think at this point, it's best to move it to Committee of the Whole and discuss it, because.

627
00:58:49,065 --> 00:58:50,066
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just ask this.

628
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:51,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me ask just one question.

629
00:58:51,947 --> 00:58:52,067
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

630
00:58:52,127 --> 00:58:54,730
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me, this is where I would be going with it.

631
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:59,732
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm trying to understand, you're telling me that don't raise the value of land.

632
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:05,494
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you don't raise the value of land, you'll have a better neighborhood or a better atmosphere, so to speak.

633
00:59:06,174 --> 00:59:09,275
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that being taken, taking place, what you're saying is that

634
00:59:10,936 --> 00:59:32,956
[SPEAKER_13]: ignore zoning because zoning is a big reason why land values go up and if you are going to take out the free competitive spirit of Somebody buying a piece of property and doing what he wants by ignoring the zoning laws that absolutely exist at the present time whether it be for a chapter 40 B or affordable zoning that flies in the face of

635
00:59:33,656 --> 00:59:35,458
[SPEAKER_13]: of what the petition is all about.

636
00:59:35,978 --> 00:59:47,108
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think what Dr. Starello is basically trying to say, all you're doing is moving the debt from today till tomorrow, and when tomorrow comes, whether it's two today or 10 or 12 or 14, what are you dealing with?

637
00:59:47,469 --> 00:59:53,574
[SPEAKER_13]: Somebody's gonna wind up paying for it, but in the meantime, it's a cost factor that's being reflected upon everyday taxpayer.

638
00:59:54,014 --> 00:59:58,438
[SPEAKER_13]: So when somebody says that the value of land, don't put it on the value of land,

639
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:05,121
[SPEAKER_13]: That seems to be the intrinsic value of how developers seem to come into a community, see the value.

640
01:00:05,281 --> 01:00:06,781
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't care about the location.

641
01:00:06,821 --> 01:00:09,122
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't care about what the density is going to do with it.

642
01:00:09,842 --> 01:00:15,464
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's your zoning that's gonna predicate the value of land and its use of land and neighborhoods.

643
01:00:15,804 --> 01:00:19,045
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how I read what Councilor Morell just offered.

644
01:00:19,225 --> 01:00:19,585
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

645
01:00:19,645 --> 01:00:19,966
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

646
01:00:20,406 --> 01:00:22,906
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have two papers before us, the B paper.

647
01:00:22,927 --> 01:00:27,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Please have the clerk read the B paper back.

648
01:00:31,786 --> 01:00:42,472
[SPEAKER_08]: The B paper, as I have it, is when the council stays with the current cap or sets a new cap, that the city include a copy of this notice the next time property tax bills are sent out.

649
01:00:43,393 --> 01:00:47,795
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Morell, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

650
01:00:48,035 --> 01:00:48,736
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

651
01:00:48,756 --> 01:00:49,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

652
01:00:49,656 --> 01:00:50,277
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

653
01:00:50,297 --> 01:00:51,257
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

654
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:57,741
[SPEAKER_07]: On the main paper, that this issue be moved to Committee of the Whole.

655
01:00:58,986 --> 01:01:01,748
[SPEAKER_07]: to be scheduled hopefully in the February-March time frame.

656
01:01:02,429 --> 01:01:05,972
[SPEAKER_07]: Offered by Councilor Morell, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

657
01:01:05,992 --> 01:01:06,732
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

658
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:08,054
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

659
01:01:09,815 --> 01:01:17,241
[SPEAKER_07]: The issue will be moved to Committee of the Whole.

660
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:18,902
[SPEAKER_07]: 20-043 offered by Councilor Marks.

661
01:01:18,982 --> 01:01:25,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the parking revenue generated and promised for business district improvements be discussed

662
01:01:31,618 --> 01:01:32,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks.

663
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:34,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

664
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:36,641
[SPEAKER_15]: I hate to say it, but here we go again.

665
01:01:36,661 --> 01:01:56,971
[SPEAKER_15]: This was a promise that was made back in 2014 when then Mayor McGlynn signed the parking contract enforcement with Republic Parking.

666
01:01:58,152 --> 01:02:17,820
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the time when they were rolling out this program, because it was considered to be somewhat detrimental to the business districts because of the new parking regulations and could have possible impact to business and so forth.

667
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:22,622
[SPEAKER_15]: could possibly deter people from using our business districts.

668
01:02:23,142 --> 01:02:45,935
[SPEAKER_15]: At the time, Mayor McGlynn offered, and I sat on the committee, the parking enforcement committee at the time, offered an olive branch to the Chamber of Commerce saying that $250,000 would be used from the enforcement money received, and that would be $50,000 for each of the five business districts.

669
01:02:46,315 --> 01:02:47,936
[SPEAKER_15]: That's where it came, all came out of.

670
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:53,161
[SPEAKER_15]: And over the last several years, I've brought this up a half a dozen times.

671
01:02:53,862 --> 01:02:59,164
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you heard this once, you'll hear it again and again, questioning where is this money?

672
01:02:59,684 --> 01:03:00,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Where is it sitting?

673
01:03:00,965 --> 01:03:05,908
[SPEAKER_15]: How come it hasn't been allocated to the different business districts?

674
01:03:06,388 --> 01:03:08,349
[SPEAKER_15]: I know many of them, such as Medford Square.

675
01:03:08,769 --> 01:03:24,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Salem Street Business Association, West Medford Business Association, have met with their membership, have discussed improvements they'd like to see in the neighborhood, have taken these improvements back to the city administration, and for the last five years, nothing has happened.

676
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:33,766
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can feel the sense of frustration, not only with the business owners, but us as a council, because I'm not the only one that has spoken about this, Mr. President.

677
01:03:35,146 --> 01:03:46,713
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, and over the last few years I've heard, well, that was a commitment by the former mayor, and it doesn't mean the next mayor would carry it out, or that was just a one-year commitment.

678
01:03:47,594 --> 01:03:49,335
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've heard a lot of different scuttlebutt.

679
01:03:49,975 --> 01:03:52,977
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you look at Method Patch, dated October 2014,

680
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:57,580
[SPEAKER_15]: The article is New Parking Enforcement in Medford.

681
01:03:58,141 --> 01:04:04,145
[SPEAKER_15]: It states, Mayor Michael J. McGlynn signed the parking enforcement contract with Republic Parking System on Tuesday.

682
01:04:04,726 --> 01:04:09,690
[SPEAKER_15]: The city of Method hopes the new enforcement will benefit the business districts.

683
01:04:10,310 --> 01:04:18,076
[SPEAKER_15]: About $250,000 of revenue collected each year will go to improving the business districts.

684
01:04:18,737 --> 01:04:19,357
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's one.

685
01:04:19,377 --> 01:04:20,538
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the Medford patch.

686
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:23,000
[SPEAKER_15]: So they must have heard it somewhere.

687
01:04:24,338 --> 01:04:33,761
[SPEAKER_15]: City website, I assume someone from the city typed this in, dated October, again, 2014.

688
01:04:34,421 --> 01:04:38,543
[SPEAKER_15]: And it says Medford signs parking enforcement contract.

689
01:04:39,823 --> 01:04:48,266
[SPEAKER_15]: After deliberating and discussing concerns raised by the business community, Mayor McGlynn is recommending the following changes to the plan.

690
01:04:49,567 --> 01:04:50,727
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to read all the changes.

691
01:04:51,647 --> 01:04:53,248
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is one of them, Mr. President.

692
01:04:53,788 --> 01:05:04,535
[SPEAKER_15]: Recommended 250,000 of revenue generated on a yearly basis, yearly basis, to be dedicated to the business district improvements.

693
01:05:06,617 --> 01:05:17,424
[SPEAKER_15]: So based on what Mayor McGlynn offered back in 2014, we're looking at, because this was the end of 2014, right now we're looking at five years of backlog.

694
01:05:18,454 --> 01:05:24,056
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's $1,250,000 that was promised to the business districts.

695
01:05:24,676 --> 01:05:27,898
[SPEAKER_15]: They have yet to receive one red cent.

696
01:05:28,678 --> 01:05:33,580
[SPEAKER_15]: And they've done a lot of work in their subcommittees putting together plans, Mr. President.

697
01:05:34,220 --> 01:05:36,581
[SPEAKER_15]: So I bring this up tonight for a number of reasons.

698
01:05:36,621 --> 01:05:39,002
[SPEAKER_15]: The fact that we have a new administration.

699
01:05:40,063 --> 01:05:45,244
[SPEAKER_15]: And I believe Mayor Lungo-Koehn is fully on board with this, Mr. President.

700
01:05:45,884 --> 01:05:56,386
[SPEAKER_15]: But I bring it up to revitalize this and to start the dialogue again with the Chamber of Commerce to get this going, Mr. President.

701
01:05:56,846 --> 01:06:01,527
[SPEAKER_15]: You can go into any one of our business districts, and they need attention.

702
01:06:02,368 --> 01:06:04,388
[SPEAKER_15]: They all need attention.

703
01:06:05,356 --> 01:06:06,737
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not pointing the finger at anyone.

704
01:06:07,017 --> 01:06:23,771
[SPEAKER_15]: They need attention, whether it's sidewalks, barrels, you name it, Mr. President, lighting, anything that would increase traffic, increase viability in the business districts.

705
01:06:24,491 --> 01:06:25,272
[SPEAKER_15]: And the money was there.

706
01:06:25,312 --> 01:06:31,597
[SPEAKER_15]: So tonight I'm asking, Mr. President, where is the money over the past five years?

707
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:35,116
[SPEAKER_15]: So Mayor McGlynn gave the commitment.

708
01:06:36,096 --> 01:06:46,640
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure because Mayor Burke never really gave a response when I asked this over the last four years, other than the fact that the business districts were working on a proposal.

709
01:06:48,680 --> 01:07:01,865
[SPEAKER_15]: So at this point, I'd like to know where the money is sitting, Mr. President, and I would respectfully ask, under this new administration, Mayor Lungo-Koehn, that this money, Mr. President, as soon as the plans are presented,

710
01:07:03,103 --> 01:07:03,684
[SPEAKER_15]: be given out.

711
01:07:04,064 --> 01:07:11,432
[SPEAKER_15]: And even if we start off with the original commitment of $250,000 and move forward, I think we'd all be fine with that.

712
01:07:11,672 --> 01:07:17,879
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the chamber, I won't speak for them, I think they would be very happy to start that off, Mr. President.

713
01:07:18,119 --> 01:07:19,961
[SPEAKER_15]: And like I said, they have plans.

714
01:07:20,862 --> 01:07:21,803
[SPEAKER_15]: They did their homework.

715
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:23,725
[SPEAKER_15]: They know what improvements they'd like to see.

716
01:07:25,299 --> 01:07:27,840
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether it's benches, there was a lot of things mentioned.

717
01:07:28,220 --> 01:07:33,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Power washing sidewalks, putting new lighting, putting some decorations in certain areas.

718
01:07:35,083 --> 01:07:38,784
[SPEAKER_15]: So new sidewalks in areas that could use it.

719
01:07:39,084 --> 01:07:41,105
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's my resolution tonight, Mr. President.

720
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:43,986
[SPEAKER_15]: I know Mayor Lungo-Koehn's going to follow up with this.

721
01:07:44,546 --> 01:07:52,029
[SPEAKER_15]: And I feel comfortable moving forward that that commitment that was made in 2014 to the business districts will be kept, Mr. President.

722
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:52,909
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

723
01:07:53,089 --> 01:07:54,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

724
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:59,091
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Caraviello.

725
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:00,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

726
01:08:00,171 --> 01:08:10,854
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm on board with Councilor Marks on this, being on the Chamber board for many years, and I think I was on the board back then when this first came through.

727
01:08:11,954 --> 01:08:13,695
[SPEAKER_11]: The Chamber's more than done their homework.

728
01:08:13,775 --> 01:08:14,875
[SPEAKER_11]: They know where the money's needed.

729
01:08:15,235 --> 01:08:18,916
[SPEAKER_11]: They've met, they've got their, listen, there, you give me the money tomorrow, there.

730
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:20,470
[SPEAKER_11]: They know where to put it.

731
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:24,452
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's not argue about where it's going.

732
01:08:24,472 --> 01:08:26,293
[SPEAKER_11]: They know where it needs to go.

733
01:08:26,673 --> 01:08:34,136
[SPEAKER_11]: But I recall the first $250,000 didn't come from revenue of the parking meters.

734
01:08:34,816 --> 01:08:38,778
[SPEAKER_11]: Then Mayor McGlynn took it out of a sale of real estate, because that's where we got it right away.

735
01:08:39,558 --> 01:08:43,840
[SPEAKER_11]: And it sat there, and where did it go after that?

736
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,321
[SPEAKER_11]: I know Mayor Burke said it was there.

737
01:08:48,109 --> 01:09:11,062
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we have multiple councils in the city, so it's sitting in our coffers somewhere, but if we at least get the 250 out, get them going and get it, springtime, you know, spring will be coming up, let them go out and see what they want to do, so this way, when spring and summer goes, they're already in the improvements, we'll be all rolled all the way then, so.

738
01:09:11,142 --> 01:09:12,603
[SPEAKER_11]: A motion for approval on Councilor Marks.

739
01:09:12,663 --> 01:09:13,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

740
01:09:14,223 --> 01:09:16,625
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

741
01:09:17,779 --> 01:09:19,139
[SPEAKER_07]: A roll call vote has been requested.

742
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,580
[SPEAKER_07]: Clerk, could you please call the roll?

743
01:09:27,903 --> 01:09:28,063
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

744
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:28,163
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

745
01:09:28,183 --> 01:09:28,303
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

746
01:09:28,323 --> 01:09:28,443
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

747
01:09:28,583 --> 01:09:28,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

748
01:09:29,543 --> 01:09:29,723
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

749
01:09:29,743 --> 01:09:29,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

750
01:09:29,843 --> 01:09:29,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

751
01:09:41,391 --> 01:09:51,640
[SPEAKER_07]: 20-044 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council wish Medford's 2019 Citizen of the Year, Rosemary Adagna, a very happy 80th birthday.

752
01:09:52,561 --> 01:09:53,061
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

753
01:09:53,481 --> 01:10:00,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I believe it was early in December that we were up here singing Rosemary praises for her recent achievement being named Medford's 2019 Citizen of the Year.

754
01:10:02,814 --> 01:10:09,001
[SPEAKER_02]: And as such, just recently, at the end of this month, earlier this month, she celebrated a very momentous birthday.

755
01:10:09,661 --> 01:10:11,583
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's been quite a year for Rosemary.

756
01:10:11,623 --> 01:10:14,066
[SPEAKER_02]: She became a citizen of the year and an octogenarian.

757
01:10:14,487 --> 01:10:18,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to wish her a very happy 80th birthday and ask my council colleagues to join her.

758
01:10:18,931 --> 01:10:19,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

759
01:10:21,094 --> 01:10:21,814
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

760
01:10:22,235 --> 01:10:22,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

761
01:10:24,639 --> 01:10:26,721
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to wish Rosemary a happy 8th birthday.

762
01:10:27,902 --> 01:10:32,005
[SPEAKER_11]: Her and I are longtime friends and I hope I have the amount of energy when I'm 80 that she has.

763
01:10:32,025 --> 01:10:36,208
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, the woman's out there volunteering and doing things like she's 50.

764
01:10:36,248 --> 01:10:40,271
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, congratulations on her 80th birthday.

765
01:10:41,532 --> 01:10:42,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

766
01:10:44,435 --> 01:10:48,157
[SPEAKER_07]: On behalf of the City Council, happy birthday to Rosemary.

767
01:10:48,538 --> 01:10:51,180
[SPEAKER_07]: Now the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

768
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:51,960
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

769
01:10:51,980 --> 01:10:52,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

770
01:10:52,401 --> 01:10:53,001
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

771
01:10:53,021 --> 01:10:53,762
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

772
01:10:56,980 --> 01:11:04,282
[SPEAKER_07]: 20-045 offered by Vice President Caraviello be it resolved that the Medford City Council adopt an ordinance regulating donation collection bins.

773
01:11:05,062 --> 01:11:24,205
[SPEAKER_07]: The purpose of this ordinance is to protect the public health, safety and to address the donation collection bins within the City of Medford and to provide regulations to ensure that donation collection bins are located and maintained so as to promote public safety, health and welfare in a clean and safe condition.

774
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:32,273
[SPEAKER_07]: We have further resolved that the city of Method established a permit and applicable fee for collection boxes.

775
01:11:32,293 --> 01:11:35,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Caraviello.

776
01:11:35,054 --> 01:11:35,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

777
01:11:35,774 --> 01:11:46,378
[SPEAKER_11]: This is something I brought up, I think, two weeks ago in regards to a couple of the boxes in the city that were strewn with trash all around them.

778
01:11:47,738 --> 01:11:52,540
[SPEAKER_11]: I got a call from a gentleman from Planet Aid explaining to me what happened.

779
01:11:53,427 --> 01:12:02,753
[SPEAKER_11]: and to get it cleaned up, but he had asked me why we don't have an ordinance in the city of Method in regards to regulating these boxes.

780
01:12:03,719 --> 01:12:05,380
[SPEAKER_11]: And I didn't know.

781
01:12:05,941 --> 01:12:09,303
[SPEAKER_11]: And he, in turn, sent me a couple of ordinances from different cities.

782
01:12:09,963 --> 01:12:11,644
[SPEAKER_11]: And they were pretty good.

783
01:12:11,684 --> 01:12:17,127
[SPEAKER_11]: But what he explained to me is what's happening is there's people that come out with boxes.

784
01:12:17,668 --> 01:12:19,729
[SPEAKER_11]: And they just put them on people's property.

785
01:12:19,809 --> 01:12:20,589
[SPEAKER_11]: And people don't know.

786
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:23,111
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of people, they're absentee landlords or things.

787
01:12:23,511 --> 01:12:25,793
[SPEAKER_11]: They don't know where they came from.

788
01:12:25,853 --> 01:12:28,914
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's no identification of where the boxes are.

789
01:12:29,775 --> 01:12:32,497
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, I didn't realize that Planet Aid

790
01:12:33,294 --> 01:12:34,835
[SPEAKER_11]: It's got six boxes in the city.

791
01:12:35,916 --> 01:12:39,539
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know where they all are, but there's boxes out there.

792
01:12:39,779 --> 01:12:40,719
[SPEAKER_11]: There's boxes for books.

793
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:41,800
[SPEAKER_11]: There's boxes for a lot of things.

794
01:12:42,481 --> 01:12:46,924
[SPEAKER_11]: But some of these companies that operate these are for profit.

795
01:12:47,004 --> 01:12:48,745
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not all non-profit organizations.

796
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:52,108
[SPEAKER_11]: And what also happens is now they're becoming garbage dumps.

797
01:12:53,049 --> 01:13:01,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Because people have a television, they don't want to spend the $25 to get the ticket for waste manager to take it.

798
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:06,274
[SPEAKER_11]: Or there's just toys that they can't fit in the barrel and the rubbish man won't take them.

799
01:13:06,574 --> 01:13:11,556
[SPEAKER_11]: And now these guys that own these bins, spending thousands and thousands of dollars.

800
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:20,445
[SPEAKER_11]: to what started out as a good idea for donations, now they're becoming trash receptacles for people who have nowhere to go with their rubbish.

801
01:13:20,785 --> 01:13:35,774
[SPEAKER_11]: So I ask that the solicitor adopt an ordinance, and I have a couple that I'll forward to her that was given, and to establish a permit and fee process for the city of Method.

802
01:13:36,575 --> 01:13:38,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to send this to the city solicitor then?

803
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:43,762
[SPEAKER_11]: I will send her a couple of the ordinances that he sent me from a couple of different cities.

804
01:13:45,243 --> 01:13:46,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

805
01:13:47,024 --> 01:13:47,525
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

806
01:13:49,646 --> 01:13:51,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

807
01:13:51,808 --> 01:13:56,231
[SPEAKER_02]: Paper 17321 was introduced in 2017 before the council.

808
01:13:56,312 --> 01:14:05,679
[SPEAKER_02]: It had gone through a subcommittee process and was a paper that was reported out favorably by the subcommittee on ordinances, I do believe, and then was never scheduled for a committee of the whole.

809
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:10,925
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a paper that was also designed to regulate drop boxes here in the community of Medford.

810
01:14:11,665 --> 01:14:16,309
[SPEAKER_02]: During the deliberations and discussions of this issue, one thing came up that was very important.

811
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:24,015
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a textile recycling fundraising program at our elementary schools and our middle schools and

812
01:14:27,352 --> 01:14:32,514
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities exemption was something that was very important at the time, and I'm sure that still holds true.

813
01:14:32,934 --> 01:14:43,979
[SPEAKER_02]: So moving forward, if we're going to regulate donation drop boxes by way of ordinance, I'd just like to request that school and city facilities be excluded from the ordinance.

814
01:14:45,459 --> 01:14:46,340
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

815
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:49,681
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that an amendment to the main paper?

816
01:14:49,701 --> 01:14:51,682
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be an amendment to the main paper, Mr. President.

817
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:54,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

818
01:14:55,514 --> 01:14:57,395
[SPEAKER_10]: As someone who used textile recycling this week.

819
01:14:57,676 --> 01:14:58,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

820
01:14:58,196 --> 01:14:58,756
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

821
01:14:59,437 --> 01:15:08,782
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also that yeah I got it from the first but much appreciated.

822
01:15:10,643 --> 01:15:17,688
[SPEAKER_10]: I think this is an important issue and I just wanted to make my own joke which is I think it's always good when the person you're trying to regulate is asking for regulations.

823
01:15:17,828 --> 01:15:19,189
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm encouraged by this.

824
01:15:19,669 --> 01:15:19,969
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

825
01:15:20,029 --> 01:15:20,790
[SPEAKER_07]: And my time.

826
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:22,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Marks.

827
01:15:26,318 --> 01:15:27,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Mr. President.

828
01:15:27,178 --> 01:15:35,525
[SPEAKER_15]: This has been, as Councilor Knight alluded to, a long ongoing issue in the community regulating these drop boxes.

829
01:15:35,926 --> 01:15:39,729
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for doing the homework and research on it.

830
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:42,231
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a magnificent idea.

831
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:49,317
[SPEAKER_15]: I would also recommend, in addition to what Councilor Knight mentioned about those amendments which were a concern,

832
01:15:49,997 --> 01:15:56,219
[SPEAKER_15]: because we don't want to impact fundraising and so forth of any type of school facility and so forth.

833
01:15:57,519 --> 01:16:02,501
[SPEAKER_15]: But these boxes at the very least, Mr. President, should have some type of ID tag on them.

834
01:16:03,021 --> 01:16:03,641
[SPEAKER_15]: Who owns it?

835
01:16:03,961 --> 01:16:04,782
[SPEAKER_15]: Who operates it?

836
01:16:05,082 --> 01:16:06,042
[SPEAKER_15]: A contact number?

837
01:16:06,462 --> 01:16:08,483
[SPEAKER_15]: There's nothing on these boxes at all.

838
01:16:10,163 --> 01:16:12,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Caraviello.

839
01:16:16,325 --> 01:16:26,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Other cities require them to put a point of contact on them and get permission from the property owner to put this box on so you know that it's in the right spot.

840
01:16:28,039 --> 01:16:28,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

841
01:16:30,762 --> 01:16:39,384
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I just wanted to make those points that at the very least, Mr. President, like I mentioned last time this was brought up, we regulate dumpsters.

842
01:16:40,084 --> 01:16:50,106
[SPEAKER_15]: If you're doing some home improvement and you want to get a dumpster, we not only regulate it, we charge you a fee, but someone could pop up a dumpster in any open lot outside.

843
01:16:50,586 --> 01:16:56,167
[SPEAKER_15]: The one on the Fells where I keep referring to because I drive by it all the time, there are five boxes out there now.

844
01:16:56,547 --> 01:16:59,948
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not about one medium-sized box, there's a large,

845
01:17:00,828 --> 01:17:03,411
[SPEAKER_15]: Giant box out there with four small ones.

846
01:17:03,631 --> 01:17:04,592
[SPEAKER_15]: Looked like it had babies.

847
01:17:05,573 --> 01:17:06,874
[SPEAKER_15]: Four smaller boxes now.

848
01:17:07,435 --> 01:17:09,617
[SPEAKER_15]: And there's stuff all over the place out there.

849
01:17:10,417 --> 01:17:12,279
[SPEAKER_15]: And people are constantly dropping things off.

850
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:15,462
[SPEAKER_15]: You go out there, anytime there's always items out there.

851
01:17:15,783 --> 01:17:17,384
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's a safety issue, Mr. President.

852
01:17:18,065 --> 01:17:20,107
[SPEAKER_15]: What if a little kid climbs in one of these boxes?

853
01:17:21,035 --> 01:17:22,555
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we have no way of getting in these.

854
01:17:22,575 --> 01:17:24,736
[SPEAKER_15]: We have no way of, no contact.

855
01:17:24,756 --> 01:17:26,216
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't know who's operating them.

856
01:17:26,576 --> 01:17:27,737
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a real safety concern.

857
01:17:27,797 --> 01:17:28,177
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

858
01:17:28,677 --> 01:17:29,837
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank Councilor Caraviello.

859
01:17:29,857 --> 01:17:30,117
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

860
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:33,378
[SPEAKER_07]: So Councilor March, are you offering that as an amendment, the tags and the?

861
01:17:33,678 --> 01:17:36,039
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll offer it at the time of the committee meeting, so no, no.

862
01:17:36,999 --> 01:17:40,900
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Knight.

863
01:17:42,179 --> 01:17:42,799
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

864
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:43,919
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

865
01:17:44,179 --> 01:17:47,160
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

866
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:49,401
[SPEAKER_07]: 20-046 offered by Councilor Bears and Councilor Morell.

867
01:17:49,901 --> 01:17:56,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the issue of applications for new housing developments made under Chapter 40B be discussed.

868
01:18:03,504 --> 01:18:04,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

869
01:18:07,597 --> 01:18:21,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Introduce this resolution with Councilor Morell because as I think many people in the room and it's already come up once tonight but also many people across the city know there are now several applications under Chapter 40 B for a large new housing developments.

870
01:18:22,423 --> 01:18:24,984
[SPEAKER_10]: There is the one on Mystic Valley Parkway.

871
01:18:25,624 --> 01:18:29,866
[SPEAKER_10]: There's also one on the Fells way and now combined properties has issued.

872
01:18:30,727 --> 01:18:33,250
[SPEAKER_10]: At least started the process around Mystic Avenue.

873
01:18:34,391 --> 01:18:37,474
[SPEAKER_10]: These are I mean I think those add up to almost a thousand new units.

874
01:18:37,514 --> 01:18:38,575
[SPEAKER_10]: It might even be more than that.

875
01:18:38,595 --> 01:18:39,956
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll have to double check my math.

876
01:18:40,076 --> 01:18:42,498
[SPEAKER_10]: But obviously that's significant new development.

877
01:18:43,739 --> 01:18:49,424
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's happening under state statute that limits some of our ability to control development.

878
01:18:51,089 --> 01:18:58,199
[SPEAKER_10]: I think as I've said many times to people that all of this development should be community driven.

879
01:18:58,219 --> 01:19:01,424
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to have community driven processes to make sure that development is happening.

880
01:19:01,806 --> 01:19:10,269
[SPEAKER_10]: The way that we wanted to happen, not the way that developers wanted to happen, but as I said, anything that's coming through 40 B puts us in a much more difficult position to get that done.

881
01:19:11,569 --> 01:19:20,592
[SPEAKER_10]: We will need strong community and administrative pushback, or at least, you know, really a strong movement around these projects to see what we can do.

882
01:19:21,272 --> 01:19:25,957
[SPEAKER_10]: To make them fit into the community and in a reasonable way if possible.

883
01:19:26,958 --> 01:19:30,742
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it just speaks a couple things specifically on 40 B that I want to get out there.

884
01:19:30,762 --> 01:19:38,409
[SPEAKER_10]: It really speaks to the need to get to safe harbor around this so that we can make sure that developers are negotiating with the city and with the community.

885
01:19:39,674 --> 01:19:51,062
[SPEAKER_10]: And also just speaks to the fact that on any of these in any of these developments all of the affordable you know the defined affordable units need to be in perpetuity.

886
01:19:51,702 --> 01:19:56,666
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to make sure that those units are permanent to the best extent possible.

887
01:19:57,228 --> 01:20:03,411
[SPEAKER_10]: And I want to turn it over to Councilor Morell, who I believe spoke to the administration and has some updates as well.

888
01:20:04,732 --> 01:20:05,612
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

889
01:20:06,132 --> 01:20:15,857
[SPEAKER_16]: So, yeah, we introduced this because I know I feel already a lot of questions from residents about what voice residents and the city has in this process process.

890
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:19,639
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're in a somewhat unprecedented place with three applications.

891
01:20:20,689 --> 01:20:22,290
[SPEAKER_16]: At this time for 40 B projects.

892
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:31,076
[SPEAKER_16]: So I did speak with the mayor about this, and she informed me that she'll be engaging an expert to speak with department heads in City Hall on 40 be within the next couple of weeks.

893
01:20:31,596 --> 01:20:36,780
[SPEAKER_16]: And that is something that Councilors will be invited to, um, hopefully something we can report back out on.

894
01:20:37,447 --> 01:21:02,177
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I guess that mass housing will also provide a consultant so that something else she may be pursuing So just options to look at so just the idea that when this is in place after we've had these meetings these briefings Having a public meeting or committee the whole set to this so that we can have someone a department had someone from the building department who is up to speed on where we stand with all these applications and what

895
01:21:02,677 --> 01:21:09,641
[SPEAKER_16]: power we have can present this out and provide a bit of a forum for people to ask questions about what this will look like going forward.

896
01:21:10,801 --> 01:21:11,622
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

897
01:21:13,723 --> 01:21:14,443
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello.

898
01:21:14,683 --> 01:21:15,624
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

899
01:21:18,285 --> 01:21:31,312
[SPEAKER_11]: Over the weekend, myself and Councilor Falco took a workshop in regards to some of these things, but in talking to some people in regards to this, I'm led to believe that the city is able to go out and bring in an advocate.

900
01:21:32,208 --> 01:21:34,270
[SPEAKER_11]: similar to a project manager that we have in particular.

901
01:21:34,611 --> 01:21:40,657
[SPEAKER_11]: But this person here goes out and advocates for the city for the 40B projects.

902
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:43,519
[SPEAKER_11]: He and this person gets paid for by the developer.

903
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:48,785
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know if that's something that we've done or we intend to do.

904
01:21:48,845 --> 01:21:53,750
[SPEAKER_11]: But they're out there and from what I'm told, these people are very successful.

905
01:21:54,431 --> 01:22:00,593
[SPEAKER_11]: There's three or four different companies that go out there and really fight for the cities with 40B projects.

906
01:22:01,093 --> 01:22:02,534
[SPEAKER_11]: And they do get results.

907
01:22:02,554 --> 01:22:14,518
[SPEAKER_11]: So if I can make it a B paper, that the city check out this option of hiring the advocate that is paid for by the developer.

908
01:22:15,038 --> 01:22:16,859
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've got three projects going.

909
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:22,521
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we can get one advocate to go out there and work for the city in all three.

910
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

911
01:22:31,508 --> 01:22:32,369
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address for the record.

912
01:22:33,551 --> 01:22:35,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Barpenta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass.

913
01:22:35,972 --> 01:22:39,573
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is going to reflect back on some of the comments that I made a little bit earlier.

914
01:22:40,033 --> 01:22:51,377
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, the City of Medford is a member of the Massachusetts Municipal Association, and they have individuals who are very professional in the housing portion of what we're talking about here right now.

915
01:22:51,397 --> 01:22:58,760
[SPEAKER_13]: To go out and hire a private consultant that pushes and advocates for Chapter 40B, I don't think would be a very wise idea.

916
01:23:00,424 --> 01:23:01,445
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, against the 40B.

917
01:23:01,825 --> 01:23:03,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought you said... I'm sorry.

918
01:23:04,927 --> 01:23:12,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, you may not have to do that because if the Office of Community Development gets itself redesigned, hopefully you would have somebody up there who would understand what the process is.

919
01:23:12,771 --> 01:23:14,132
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to understand something.

920
01:23:14,152 --> 01:23:24,257
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a difference between Chapter 40B, which does come under a few Massachusetts housing management departments, as compared to affordable housing.

921
01:23:24,337 --> 01:23:27,059
[SPEAKER_13]: Affordable housing is usually a private,

922
01:23:27,779 --> 01:23:38,264
[SPEAKER_13]: But working with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, who to some degree sets some standards up there as it relates to not only affordability, which has to be, but the permanent and perpetuity of having the

923
01:23:40,091 --> 01:23:44,854
[SPEAKER_13]: the reduced cost unit, whether it be the rental or whether it be the housing.

924
01:23:45,694 --> 01:23:49,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Chapter 40B is made for a private developer.

925
01:23:49,536 --> 01:23:58,241
[SPEAKER_13]: He'll come in there and say in the city of Method, well, you've got to get between, your income level has to be 80% of the medium income in the area that you're applying to put the housing in.

926
01:23:58,642 --> 01:24:02,184
[SPEAKER_13]: And if that be the case, you know, we can do that or we'll put 100 units up.

927
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:10,020
[SPEAKER_13]: 25, 2025, whatever the number's gonna turn out to be, will be affordable, and we'll just raise the cost on the other end of the units.

928
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:11,721
[SPEAKER_13]: So what did you wind up getting?

929
01:24:12,341 --> 01:24:14,862
[SPEAKER_13]: You really didn't complete anything.

930
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:23,808
[SPEAKER_13]: Me personally, my suggestion would be that the city goes into a complete moratorium on any and all development to take place, because you don't have anything right now.

931
01:24:24,228 --> 01:24:28,631
[SPEAKER_13]: You have a Chapter 40B person who can come in, who just came in right now on Mystic Avenue,

932
01:24:29,591 --> 01:24:35,859
[SPEAKER_13]: and will bypass your height restrictions and other zoning requirements because that's what 40B is allowed to do.

933
01:24:35,919 --> 01:24:44,009
[SPEAKER_13]: If you read chapter 69 of chapter 49, excuse me, of chapter 40B, that's what they'll tell you.

934
01:24:44,229 --> 01:24:46,151
[SPEAKER_13]: They can come in and they detour and they go around.

935
01:24:46,972 --> 01:24:51,916
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know you guys, Councilor Knight and Councilor Scarpelli, have talked about over the last two or three years, zoning.

936
01:24:52,296 --> 01:25:05,125
[SPEAKER_13]: So maybe you should hire a zoning consultant right now to figure out how you bring up an update of a 40-year-old zoning that you have here in the city of Method because every Chapter 40B that comes in here will bypass upstairs and they'll get around it.

937
01:25:05,606 --> 01:25:10,529
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's the privilege that you have for being a Chapter 40B participant, okay?

938
01:25:10,589 --> 01:25:11,730
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you want to have a Chapter 40B

939
01:25:13,231 --> 01:25:16,773
[SPEAKER_13]: be participant that works with the city, then that's what you need.

940
01:25:16,813 --> 01:25:22,357
[SPEAKER_13]: You need to have someone who goes into the neighborhood and sees where the project is going and how is it going to enhance.

941
01:25:22,417 --> 01:25:25,419
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not gonna produce a density buster.

942
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:27,680
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what you don't want, and that's what's happening right now.

943
01:25:28,281 --> 01:25:32,123
[SPEAKER_13]: Density busting all over the city, because private developers know how to do it.

944
01:25:32,784 --> 01:25:36,906
[SPEAKER_13]: They're efficient at doing it, they make it sound good, and what do you have left?

945
01:25:37,387 --> 01:25:39,288
[SPEAKER_13]: You have all these developments all over the place.

946
01:25:40,797 --> 01:25:46,959
[SPEAKER_13]: schools, police, fire, public works, infrastructure, water and sewer.

947
01:25:47,159 --> 01:25:50,060
[SPEAKER_13]: It's all affected by this, all affected by this.

948
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:59,683
[SPEAKER_13]: And while it might sound good that it looks good, that's what you're paying for in your taxes for which our commercial tax rate can't even handle because it's only a 10%.

949
01:26:00,664 --> 01:26:04,525
[SPEAKER_13]: So the burden once again is right back onto the residential taxpayer.

950
01:26:05,025 --> 01:26:07,026
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's a great idea to get into the discussion.

951
01:26:08,442 --> 01:26:17,785
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you read this case after case after case where cities and towns are so sorry that they went into Chapter 40B because it did not turn out to be what it was supposed to be.

952
01:26:18,185 --> 01:26:26,487
[SPEAKER_13]: And the fastest way to correct a Chapter 40B problem is to make sure that your zoning speaks for what you want today and for tomorrow.

953
01:26:26,767 --> 01:26:31,828
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the financial viability of what a community has to deal with as it relates to a Chapter 40B.

954
01:26:32,409 --> 01:26:34,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Not affordable housing, it's a Chapter 40B.

955
01:26:35,029 --> 01:26:37,410
[SPEAKER_13]: They're in two entirely different requirements.

956
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:39,671
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Mr. President.

957
01:26:39,711 --> 01:26:41,292
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a number of point of information here.

958
01:26:41,652 --> 01:26:46,214
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's right, Councilor Bearsley, you hit your microphone first, so you go first, and then Councilor Marks.

959
01:26:46,374 --> 01:26:47,815
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

960
01:26:48,015 --> 01:26:55,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a point of information, which is that even if we were to do a moratorium because of how Chapter 40B is written, these projects could move forward anyway.

961
01:26:55,379 --> 01:26:58,861
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's kind of the crux of the issue here, is we need to

962
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:09,051
[SPEAKER_10]: That that if we did a moratorium then and then we could still get 40 B applications in that move through the process outside of our zoning and height and design restrictions and whatnot.

963
01:27:09,111 --> 01:27:16,079
[SPEAKER_10]: So so that's part of the point is I think we need to get to that safe harbor point where 40 B is not the threat that it is right now.

964
01:27:17,481 --> 01:27:19,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Well you can still appears cut from our.

965
01:27:20,526 --> 01:27:23,948
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, Councilor Bears just reiterated what I was going to state.

966
01:27:25,709 --> 01:27:33,494
[SPEAKER_15]: I was wondering if Councilor Penta was aware of any community that did have a moratorium that a 40B project was not allowed at.

967
01:27:34,154 --> 01:27:36,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, if you go to the city of Somerville, they just went through it for a year and a half.

968
01:27:37,236 --> 01:27:44,500
[SPEAKER_13]: They stopped, they had a moratorium as it relates to that type of development that took place over there because of what was taking place so fast.

969
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:46,081
[SPEAKER_15]: And that stopped a potential 40B project?

970
01:27:46,301 --> 01:27:47,802
[SPEAKER_13]: They did nothing for that period of time.

971
01:27:48,442 --> 01:27:51,063
[SPEAKER_13]: as it relates to multi-use development.

972
01:27:51,183 --> 01:27:53,844
[SPEAKER_15]: But was there a 40B project offered during that period of time?

973
01:27:54,404 --> 01:27:56,725
[SPEAKER_13]: To the best of my, to moratorium, so that means you can't.

974
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:58,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Another point of information.

975
01:27:58,305 --> 01:28:00,846
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that's, yeah.

976
01:28:00,886 --> 01:28:02,407
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Bears.

977
01:28:02,507 --> 01:28:09,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Somerville was at their 10% safe harbor threshold, so they couldn't get 40B the way that we can, being under that percentage.

978
01:28:10,871 --> 01:28:25,676
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the things that a Chapter 40B does tell you, if they go before a Board of Appeals, if the Board of Appeals feels, this is the term that they use, and it's not a friendly Chapter 40B, that's the term, friendly, they can shoot that down.

979
01:28:26,196 --> 01:28:28,177
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, what determines to be friendly?

980
01:28:29,157 --> 01:28:31,638
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be public health, it could be public safety.

981
01:28:31,678 --> 01:28:34,339
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the two biggest issues that you'd have going.

982
01:28:34,879 --> 01:28:37,740
[SPEAKER_13]: Other than being in a residential neighborhood and making it high density,

983
01:28:38,953 --> 01:28:39,914
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a subjective thought.

984
01:28:40,194 --> 01:28:41,354
[SPEAKER_13]: That's all I can tell you.

985
01:28:42,055 --> 01:29:00,184
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you are going to hire somebody, or Office of Community Development is going to employ somebody, consultant or otherwise, that's the first thing I would address, because you have such archaic laws, you can go to the Board of Appeals right now and come in and make a proposal, and you can't shoot it down, because YDB will allow you to do it.

986
01:29:03,814 --> 01:29:18,429
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an interesting concept and the city of Method really needs to address it because you've gone at a fever pitch over the past many years with all kinds of development and there's no checks and balances to it.

987
01:29:18,449 --> 01:29:22,232
[SPEAKER_13]: 61 Locust Street is really the issue that should bring this all to a head.

988
01:29:22,713 --> 01:29:25,035
[SPEAKER_13]: It should have brought it to a head then when they wanted to put 500 units there.

989
01:29:26,676 --> 01:29:28,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and what did they do?

990
01:29:28,499 --> 01:29:38,452
[SPEAKER_13]: The big developer went in there and bought out the neighborhood, bought out every single house in the neighborhood, and they reduced it to 345, which the Board of Appeals allowed, and it managed to put itself through.

991
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:42,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

992
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:47,046
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important to point out that this council sued the Board of Appeals relative to that decision that they made.

993
01:29:47,086 --> 01:29:48,588
[SPEAKER_02]: We took this case to court and we lost.

994
01:29:48,608 --> 01:29:50,389
[SPEAKER_02]: We were found to not have standing.

995
01:29:51,190 --> 01:30:00,918
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe that the reason, I believe Councilor, the reason why the city lost is because the neighborhood agreed to the reduction of $345,000 after they all got bought out.

996
01:30:01,379 --> 01:30:04,842
[SPEAKER_13]: So our suit was completely moved at that point in time.

997
01:30:05,823 --> 01:30:07,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

998
01:30:09,175 --> 01:30:12,177
[SPEAKER_02]: The Medford City Council filed suit and was thrown out.

999
01:30:12,638 --> 01:30:22,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And the land court judge had found the city legislative body had zero standing to appeal the issue.

1000
01:30:22,466 --> 01:30:28,250
[SPEAKER_13]: But they felt it had zero standing, but also the then mayor at the time refused to give additional money to go forward with the case.

1001
01:30:28,791 --> 01:30:29,371
[SPEAKER_02]: We got thrown out.

1002
01:30:31,493 --> 01:30:32,133
[SPEAKER_13]: You could have appealed.

1003
01:30:32,153 --> 01:30:34,435
[SPEAKER_02]: We spent $60,000 to be told we didn't have standing.

1004
01:30:37,601 --> 01:30:40,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the question was, are we going to spend another 60 grand to be told that again?

1005
01:30:41,667 --> 01:30:47,269
[SPEAKER_02]: But I rest my case, but I just wanted to point out the factual history of the process and what went down with Locust Street.

1006
01:30:47,449 --> 01:30:48,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilman.

1007
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:51,171
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't sitting back on our hands saying, oh, Locust Street's going on.

1008
01:30:51,191 --> 01:30:51,851
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what happened.

1009
01:30:51,891 --> 01:30:52,571
[SPEAKER_02]: We sued the city.

1010
01:30:52,631 --> 01:30:54,012
[SPEAKER_02]: We sued the zoning board.

1011
01:30:54,052 --> 01:31:03,835
[SPEAKER_13]: But I also believe, Mr. President, when you lost the issue on standing, it was a moot issue, because all the people, the residents, pushed back on the lawsuit, because they all got bought out.

1012
01:31:04,315 --> 01:31:10,778
[SPEAKER_13]: So the standing for which the council had was not being supported by the neighborhood, which initiated the lawsuit in the first place.

1013
01:31:12,076 --> 01:31:16,178
[SPEAKER_13]: And the council got originally $20,000 in the beginning to get the case going.

1014
01:31:17,739 --> 01:31:19,120
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was 40, Mr. President.

1015
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:23,782
[SPEAKER_17]: And we weren't, we weren't, we weren't, uh, you know, co-defendants or co-appellants.

1016
01:31:23,962 --> 01:31:31,046
[SPEAKER_17]: We were an individual entity that moved forward as a, in a silo, not with the neighborhood, not with anybody else, but we're in the best interest of the community.

1017
01:31:31,686 --> 01:31:31,926
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1018
01:31:31,966 --> 01:31:32,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1019
01:31:32,867 --> 01:31:34,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Castagnetti, would you like to speak?

1020
01:31:34,988 --> 01:31:36,429
[SPEAKER_07]: Please come close to the microphone.

1021
01:31:36,609 --> 01:31:37,469
[SPEAKER_12]: Haven't decided yet.

1022
01:31:38,050 --> 01:31:39,430
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1023
01:31:39,871 --> 01:31:40,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Haven't decided yet.

1024
01:31:41,718 --> 01:31:43,479
[SPEAKER_12]: Andrew, Cush Street, Medford, Mass.

1025
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,342
[SPEAKER_12]: There's been some good points and concerns brought up with this Chapter 40B.

1026
01:31:49,362 --> 01:31:55,405
[SPEAKER_12]: If I remember correctly, one of my many jobs was 30 years ago about real estate.

1027
01:31:55,425 --> 01:32:08,232
[SPEAKER_12]: For the layman out there that doesn't know what it is, correct me if I'm wrong, but the gist of it is, in any city or town, specifically here, we're speaking of Medford,

1028
01:32:11,539 --> 01:32:37,471
[SPEAKER_12]: If our total housing stock is not at 10% or higher affordability, that a developer can come in from wherever, from the world, and buy a nice piece of valuable land, and pretty much do what they want, or should I say, circumvent the present zoning laws, if there are any at that area.

1029
01:32:38,991 --> 01:32:40,392
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe it's something to that effect.

1030
01:32:41,112 --> 01:32:41,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Make sense?

1031
01:32:41,813 --> 01:32:42,493
[SPEAKER_12]: You are correct, sir.

1032
01:32:42,674 --> 01:32:42,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

1033
01:32:43,034 --> 01:32:44,074
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1034
01:32:45,535 --> 01:32:47,737
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to say you ain't seen nothing yet.

1035
01:32:48,297 --> 01:32:55,282
[SPEAKER_12]: We're at a crossroads with this boom times during this election year.

1036
01:32:56,863 --> 01:33:07,090
[SPEAKER_12]: And unless there's a major crash, whether it's Dow Jones or real estate, we ain't seen nothing yet, if you think about it.

1037
01:33:07,961 --> 01:33:09,963
[SPEAKER_12]: because we're not at the 10% threshold yet.

1038
01:33:10,743 --> 01:33:16,267
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and I used to live on Mystic Avenue as a youth.

1039
01:33:18,109 --> 01:33:22,852
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was a major highway to Boston, Route 38.

1040
01:33:24,454 --> 01:33:27,396
[SPEAKER_12]: And then in 1960, they built this Route 93.

1041
01:33:29,217 --> 01:33:32,340
[SPEAKER_12]: By eminent domain, they took property and schools, et cetera.

1042
01:33:34,101 --> 01:33:37,544
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have very valuable location.

1043
01:33:39,602 --> 01:33:41,743
[SPEAKER_12]: three to five miles north of Boston.

1044
01:33:43,204 --> 01:33:58,513
[SPEAKER_12]: So, also, it was mentioned about, months ago, about MAC, not a Big Mac, but Mystic Ave... Community?

1045
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:00,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Mystic Ave Corridor.

1046
01:34:01,775 --> 01:34:02,435
[SPEAKER_12]: The Big Mac.

1047
01:34:05,817 --> 01:34:08,679
[SPEAKER_12]: Although no McDonald's is in Bedford, Burger King's down there.

1048
01:34:10,947 --> 01:34:29,425
[SPEAKER_12]: But the point is, unless we get a handle on this, if it's possible to avoid this 40B being jammed on our throats with all this congestion we already have, without our Orange Line subway behind you, we're gonna be in deep stuff, man.

1049
01:34:31,407 --> 01:34:31,548
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

1050
01:34:32,762 --> 01:34:43,487
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure if you can do moratoriums or anything that's fancy with those 25 cent words, but chances are you can't if we're already in this 40 B thing with the state.

1051
01:34:44,728 --> 01:34:50,231
[SPEAKER_12]: But, carverum tuor, buyer beware, be careful.

1052
01:34:50,611 --> 01:34:53,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Casagnetti.

1053
01:34:53,712 --> 01:34:58,415
[SPEAKER_07]: On the B paper offered by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Light.

1054
01:34:59,995 --> 01:35:00,776
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1055
01:35:00,976 --> 01:35:01,076
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1056
01:35:02,605 --> 01:35:03,266
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1057
01:35:04,366 --> 01:35:05,207
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

1058
01:35:06,008 --> 01:35:12,633
[SPEAKER_07]: On the main paper offered by Councilors Beers and Councilor Morell, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1059
01:35:13,414 --> 01:35:14,114
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1060
01:35:14,134 --> 01:35:14,194
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

1061
01:35:14,795 --> 01:35:15,495
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1062
01:35:15,536 --> 01:35:16,416
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

1063
01:35:17,117 --> 01:35:20,520
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the motion?

1064
01:35:20,540 --> 01:35:27,826
[SPEAKER_07]: 20-047 offered by Councilor Bears, be it resolved that the issue of funding for the City Council to hire additional legal services be discussed.

1065
01:35:28,546 --> 01:35:29,367
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears.

1066
01:35:33,683 --> 01:35:34,704
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Mr. President.

1067
01:35:35,484 --> 01:35:37,106
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there's two issues here.

1068
01:35:37,366 --> 01:35:40,128
[SPEAKER_10]: One is let me preface this.

1069
01:35:40,168 --> 01:35:46,974
[SPEAKER_10]: So the issue here is that the council should have the ability to have its own legal services for a variety of reasons.

1070
01:35:47,254 --> 01:36:00,284
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in just permanently I think it's important for the council to have that resource so that we can get legal opinions and have legal services independent of the executive branch of the city administration.

1071
01:36:00,305 --> 01:36:03,227
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that will be always permanent but also

1072
01:36:03,877 --> 01:36:08,421
[SPEAKER_10]: I think the current circumstances facing the city bring us to.

1073
01:36:09,946 --> 01:36:16,869
[SPEAKER_10]: I won't say a unique point but kind of we're coming to a head with the amount of ordinances and other work that we're going to need to do especially as a council.

1074
01:36:18,269 --> 01:36:24,352
[SPEAKER_10]: And also we know the city solicitors currently enacting city solicitors so there is a process to hire a permanent city solicitor.

1075
01:36:25,232 --> 01:36:35,417
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think there's both good reasons at all times why the council should have legal services and also very important reasons at this moment as to why the council should have legal services and

1076
01:36:37,108 --> 01:36:46,431
[SPEAKER_10]: My motion on the issue would be that we make sure to add it to the future agenda of our committee of the whole meeting with the mayor, which I believe is forthcoming.

1077
01:36:46,891 --> 01:36:47,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, correct.

1078
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:49,072
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1079
01:36:49,112 --> 01:36:49,392
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1080
01:36:49,412 --> 01:36:49,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Council.

1081
01:36:50,013 --> 01:37:00,896
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm meeting with, uh, uh, may I go current, um, next Wednesday and then I'll be scheduling, scheduling a committee, the whole soon after that to talk about all our priorities.

1082
01:37:00,996 --> 01:37:03,417
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is something that will be addressed as well.

1083
01:37:03,637 --> 01:37:03,877
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1084
01:37:03,957 --> 01:37:04,758
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's great.

1085
01:37:04,998 --> 01:37:05,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1086
01:37:06,058 --> 01:37:07,239
[SPEAKER_07]: I thank you for bringing this forward.

1087
01:37:07,739 --> 01:37:08,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight.

1088
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I support the resolution wholeheartedly.

1089
01:37:10,921 --> 01:37:22,129
[SPEAKER_02]: I do think it's important to point out that if the council does have in fact legal counsel to provide it with legal opinions, the legal opinions relative to ethics and the like would have to come from

1090
01:37:22,648 --> 01:37:32,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Statutorily, the city solicitor's office, we can't have our own council giving us opinions related to that, but we can use this person for the very important job of drafting framework ordinances, Mr. President.

1091
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:33,351
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something we need.

1092
01:37:33,971 --> 01:37:50,475
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something, you know, just in the very short time that we've been meeting as a council, we've taken, you know, several resolutions that have been filed that we've been asking for draft ordinances to be put together on that have been two and three and four years in the making, not because the city solicitor wasn't able to do it,

1093
01:37:52,152 --> 01:38:01,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Capability-wise, it was because he has to run the everyday operations of an entire city, as well as, you know, that he had the requests that this body makes.

1094
01:38:01,957 --> 01:38:04,418
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I think that this is a step in the right direction.

1095
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:08,179
[SPEAKER_02]: It was my number two priority, Mr. President, when we talked about council priorities.

1096
01:38:08,219 --> 01:38:16,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, improving the way we deliver services here in this community, making sure that when you pick up the phone and call because your trash barrel wasn't picked up, that someone comes and picks it up for you.

1097
01:38:16,023 --> 01:38:18,004
[SPEAKER_02]: When you say there's a pothole in front of your house, it gets fixed.

1098
01:38:18,344 --> 01:38:20,005
[SPEAKER_02]: When your sidewalk needs to be repaired, it gets done.

1099
01:38:20,445 --> 01:38:22,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one priority, service delivery and improving the way we do it.

1100
01:38:22,927 --> 01:38:30,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two priority, getting counsel for the Medford City Council so that we can put out a better work product at a faster pace, Mr. President.

1101
01:38:31,371 --> 01:38:32,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1102
01:38:32,312 --> 01:38:32,712
[SPEAKER_07]: Well said.

1103
01:38:33,352 --> 01:38:34,473
[SPEAKER_14]: Name and address for the record, please.

1104
01:38:34,493 --> 01:38:35,894
[SPEAKER_14]: John Sorrell, Metcalfe Street.

1105
01:38:36,894 --> 01:38:37,755
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1106
01:38:38,794 --> 01:38:43,797
[SPEAKER_14]: This is another example of an increase in taxes, which we don't really need.

1107
01:38:44,517 --> 01:38:48,499
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, here we are, we've taken on additional, we already have a solicitor.

1108
01:38:48,559 --> 01:38:50,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1109
01:38:50,940 --> 01:38:51,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Do need this.

1110
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,161
[SPEAKER_02]: We do really need this.

1111
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:56,762
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that we don't really need, Mr. Strehler, it's something that we do really need.

1112
01:38:57,523 --> 01:39:02,445
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you're looking at the number of draft ordinances that we've requested just since this body's met this term.

1113
01:39:02,793 --> 01:39:04,855
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at nine, nine draft ordinances.

1114
01:39:04,895 --> 01:39:10,299
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more, nine ordinances is more of a work product than we put out in a term, and I can't tell you in how long.

1115
01:39:10,780 --> 01:39:15,224
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get those draft ordinances produced to us, I guarantee you we're gonna put out a stronger work product than we have in the past.

1116
01:39:15,284 --> 01:39:22,310
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have some council that's working for us, dedicated X amount of hours a week, putting those work products out, I guarantee you we're gonna do more work than we've done in the past.

1117
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:23,911
[SPEAKER_14]: You are correct.

1118
01:39:23,931 --> 01:39:28,014
[SPEAKER_14]: In all the history of Medford, we've never had legal counsel

1119
01:39:29,153 --> 01:39:30,994
[SPEAKER_14]: for the city council.

1120
01:39:31,714 --> 01:39:33,554
[SPEAKER_14]: And we already have a city solicitor.

1121
01:39:34,375 --> 01:39:36,895
[SPEAKER_14]: He represents also the council.

1122
01:39:37,595 --> 01:39:38,756
[SPEAKER_14]: He doesn't work for the mayor.

1123
01:39:39,516 --> 01:39:42,277
[SPEAKER_14]: He works for the people and he works for the whole administration.

1124
01:39:43,057 --> 01:39:48,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Another thing, this is presented and no cost amount is placed on it.

1125
01:39:48,439 --> 01:39:49,859
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know what this will cost.

1126
01:39:52,611 --> 01:39:54,132
[SPEAKER_14]: We ought to research that first.

1127
01:39:54,832 --> 01:39:58,114
[SPEAKER_14]: But I don't think it's needed because we already have a city solicitor.

1128
01:39:58,154 --> 01:39:59,455
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1129
01:39:59,715 --> 01:40:06,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if you look at the ordinances before you, it says that the issue of funding for the City Council to hire an additional legal services line item be discussed.

1130
01:40:07,379 --> 01:40:09,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I think it's also important to point out, Mr. President, that Mayor Burke

1131
01:40:10,407 --> 01:40:16,570
[SPEAKER_02]: during this fiscal year has already committed to us $40,000 for professional and legal services in the form of a zoning consultant.

1132
01:40:16,630 --> 01:40:23,453
[SPEAKER_02]: That money's never actually been transferred into our line item for professional legal services in the city council's budget and the budget of the legislative.

1133
01:40:24,133 --> 01:40:28,215
[SPEAKER_02]: It sits in a revolving fund for special services that lays in the auditor's office.

1134
01:40:29,654 --> 01:40:37,682
[SPEAKER_02]: So, with that being said, you know, we already have funds that are available to us that have been committed to us and have been budgeted to us for the purposes of legal or professional technical services, Mr. President.

1135
01:40:37,702 --> 01:40:44,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we're looking at doing is figuring out a way that we can best capture these funds and start utilizing them so that we can put out a stronger work product.

1136
01:40:45,129 --> 01:40:45,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1137
01:40:46,110 --> 01:40:47,231
[SPEAKER_07]: Please continue, Mr. Strong.

1138
01:40:47,251 --> 01:40:49,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'll end with this here.

1139
01:40:49,493 --> 01:40:53,697
[SPEAKER_14]: In my opinion, this is another example of why taxes are increased needlessly.

1140
01:40:54,478 --> 01:40:54,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1141
01:40:58,416 --> 01:41:02,220
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1142
01:41:06,505 --> 01:41:08,488
[SPEAKER_07]: You're referring it to the Committee of the Whole meeting that's coming up.

1143
01:41:09,308 --> 01:41:09,829
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, okay.

1144
01:41:10,149 --> 01:41:15,355
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight to refer this to the Committee of the Whole meeting with Mayor Lungo-Koehn.

1145
01:41:15,696 --> 01:41:16,577
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1146
01:41:17,177 --> 01:41:17,958
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1147
01:41:18,439 --> 01:41:19,240
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

1148
01:41:24,229 --> 01:41:29,993
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, that we take papers under suspension.

1149
01:41:30,013 --> 01:41:30,753
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1150
01:41:31,233 --> 01:41:32,014
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1151
01:41:32,054 --> 01:41:32,935
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

1152
01:41:32,955 --> 01:41:35,936
[SPEAKER_07]: 20-049 offered by Councilor Knight.

1153
01:41:36,377 --> 01:41:48,024
[SPEAKER_07]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council request the city administration take the necessary steps to rectify the drainage issue currently present in front of Amici's Pizzeria in West Medford Square.

1154
01:41:48,905 --> 01:41:49,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Knight?

1155
01:41:49,758 --> 01:41:51,142
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1156
01:41:51,683 --> 01:41:54,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody that knows me knows I love my amichis.

1157
01:41:54,812 --> 01:41:57,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably once a week at least, I go down to amichis and get.

1158
01:41:58,496 --> 01:42:01,897
[SPEAKER_02]: couple slices of pizza before I make my way up here to the city council meeting.

1159
01:42:01,937 --> 01:42:08,979
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get two slices of cheese with that great, you know, sauce-cheese ratio and the great flop that they have down there at Amici's, Mr. President.

1160
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:24,384
[SPEAKER_02]: But a couple weeks ago when I was getting out of my car to pick up my dinner before I came to the council meeting, I noticed that the drainage issue right in front of Amici's, recently they had a complete streets program down there and they did a bump out in the curb right where Amici's and Paul Revere's is.

1161
01:42:24,924 --> 01:42:29,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And that bumped out, but the gradient isn't conducive to proper drainage.

1162
01:42:29,573 --> 01:42:37,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's going on, Mr. President, is the water's pooling and it's becoming at least five, six, seven inches deep at some point, which renders that parking spot.

1163
01:42:39,451 --> 01:42:49,457
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the parking spot that sits right out in front of, you know, four businesses that specialize in takeout food, Hong Kong Village, CB Scoops, Amici's, and Paul Revere's.

1164
01:42:50,278 --> 01:42:56,462
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, it's having a negative impact on the businesses that worked on, that are operating down in West Bedford Square.

1165
01:42:56,602 --> 01:43:01,105
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, when they did this complete streets project and they did put the bump out in, they took away a parking spot and a half.

1166
01:43:01,866 --> 01:43:08,310
[SPEAKER_02]: So to add, you know, insult to injury, on top of losing a parking spot, now there's another parking spot there that is

1167
01:43:08,730 --> 01:43:12,351
[SPEAKER_02]: virtually useless to the business district in times of inclement weather.

1168
01:43:12,391 --> 01:43:26,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm asking that the engineering department take the appropriate steps to hold the contractor accountable that did the work and get them back out there to fix it so that the fine people that are trying to get a nice slice of pizza down there in West Medford Square are able to do so, Mr. President.

1169
01:43:27,236 --> 01:43:28,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1170
01:43:28,976 --> 01:43:31,737
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1171
01:43:31,777 --> 01:43:32,657
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1172
01:43:33,158 --> 01:43:33,798
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1173
01:43:33,818 --> 01:43:34,698
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

1174
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:38,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1175
01:43:41,184 --> 01:43:41,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Records.

1176
01:43:42,146 --> 01:43:46,813
[SPEAKER_07]: The records of the meeting of January 21st, 2020 were passed to Councilor Morell.

1177
01:43:47,134 --> 01:43:50,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morell, how did you find...

1178
01:43:52,588 --> 01:43:53,529
[SPEAKER_16]: Those records?

1179
01:43:53,549 --> 01:43:54,630
[SPEAKER_16]: I found them to be excellent.

1180
01:43:55,190 --> 01:43:56,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1181
01:43:58,393 --> 01:44:04,538
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Morell has found that those records are in excellent order and ready in moves for approval.

1182
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:06,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

1183
01:44:06,660 --> 01:44:07,461
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1184
01:44:07,861 --> 01:44:08,682
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1185
01:44:08,762 --> 01:44:12,465
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes and the records are adopted.

1186
01:44:13,986 --> 01:44:18,650
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion of Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight, that the meeting be adjourned.

1187
01:44:18,670 --> 01:44:19,411
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

1188
01:44:19,451 --> 01:44:20,191
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

1189
01:44:20,251 --> 01:44:20,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Meeting adjourned.
