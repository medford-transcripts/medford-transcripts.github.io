    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=105.857s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=106.297s">Seven</a>  present. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=107.118s">At</a>  this time, could everyone please rise to salute the flag.</p>

    <p>[WYTf73F7sag_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=109.92s">I</a>  pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=117.287s">Under</a>  God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=118.668s">Mr.</a>  President, I move to suspend the rules to take a paper out of order.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=124.252s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to suspend the rules to take a paper out of order, seconded by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=128.475s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=129.496s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=131.017s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=131.938s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=133.539s">Mr.</a>  President, I move to take paper 2013 out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=137.261s">This</a>  was a paper that was before the council previously. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=139.383s">We</a>  sent it back to the mayor with a request for amendment and it has come back as <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=144.315s">The</a>  council amended it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=145.075s">I'd</a>  like to ask a representative from the administration to come up and just give us a brief synopsis of the paper that's before us, and then hopefully move for a vote.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=153.24s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=154.34s">If</a>  you could please have a representative from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=158.423s">If</a>  you could please have your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Nunley-Benjamin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=162.445s">Aleesha</a>  Nunley Benjamin, Finance Director for the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=165.386s">Good</a>  evening, Honorable Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=167.387s">The</a>  home rule petition before you is to create a special revenue fund for our <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=172.54s">casino</a>  money which was amended now to be by appropriation by this honorable body.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=180.035s">Mr.</a>  President, I do believe, Mr. President, that the special revenue fund was a recommendation that was made by the Division of Local Services from the Department of Revenue to establish generally accepted accounting practices on how to spend the funds that come with these host community agreements and community impact agreements. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=195.918s">Based</a>  upon the language that's been provided to us and the review of the language that's been provided to us previously, it seems as though everything's in order and the recommendations of the council have been adopted by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=204.839s">As</a>  such, I'd move for approval of the paper.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=206.84s">The</a>  first reading.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=209.284s">On</a>  the motion of- No, no, it's actually a home rule petition, it's going to the legislature.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=212.085s">Excuse</a>  me, Councilor, Councilor Knight, can you repeat that, please?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=214.386s">It's</a>  a home rule petition, so it will go to the legislature.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=216.387s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=216.567s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Clerk Hurtubise, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=227.112s">Councilor</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=227.853s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=229.053s">Vice</a>  President Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=230.154s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=230.874s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=231.534s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=232.315s">Councilor</a>  Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=233.015s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=233.935s">Councilor</a>  Morell? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=234.476s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=235.376s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=236.396s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=236.817s">President</a>  Falco? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=237.357s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=237.779s">Yes,</a>  7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=239.7s">The</a>  motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=242.421s">If</a>  I may, really quick, Council Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=245.542s">Clerk</a>  Hurtubise.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=248.043s">I</a>  have the paperwork for you to sign the petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=250.244s">So</a>  I just want you to sign the petition before we, if we can do that before advancing to further business. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=256.226s">That's</a>  acceptable to council? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=257.847s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=261.629s">Mr.</a>  President, after we've done signing, can we take paper 20-048?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=266.21s">Yes,</a>  we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=267.091s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=372.839s">If</a>  we could please, the clerk will need that back.</p>

    <p>[WYTf73F7sag_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=375.261s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=375.581s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=389.07s">Okay,</a>  while we're under suspension, petitions, presentations, and similar papers, 20-048, petition by Robert M. Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Massachusetts, 02155, to speak on the city's zoning and discuss city's finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=406.157s">If</a>  we could please have your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=409.898s">Good</a>  evening, my name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, and a former member of the August body. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=415.92s">I</a>  come here tonight <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=417.987s">To</a>  make some comments on issues that I feel are important as it relates to this upcoming budget, from what I understand this administration, and I know the Chief of Staff is here, he can reflect upon the fact that you guys and Lady are going to get an early budget this year, earlier than normal. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=435.088s">If</a>  that's true, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=436.529s">Is</a>  it true? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=437.628s">So</a>  he says we hope so. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=438.768s">With</a>  that being said, and with two new Councilors on the board, I would just like to reflect upon a couple of things as it relates to what really has not been addressed for the past few months. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=449.69s">First</a>  of all, going back to last year at some point in time regarding the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, we never got a report back from the auditor's office as it relates to the outpatient surgical offices that are going to be housed <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=465.453s">in</a>  the old Lawrence Memorial Hospital as part of an addendum to the 16,000 square foot building that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to have their surgical center at. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=475.719s">And</a>  with that being said, again, it's just out there floating around not knowing what's going to happen because they haven't made a decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=483.203s">Second</a>  of all, it's the taxing of the nonprofit funeral portion <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=488.206s">of</a>  the operation at the Gaffey Funeral Home, which houses the Islamic Cultural Center here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=495.068s">And</a>  where they're going to be running a funeral business out of that center, once again, it presents itself as a for-profit business within the non-profit structure itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=506.011s">Again,</a>  no answers come back on that as of yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=509.192s">And</a>  these are issues that I think need to be discussed and resolved before or at least during your budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=515.834s">Also,</a>  let's go back to something that Councilor Caraviello, when he first came on to the Council, talked about, the disrepair of the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=524.222s">At</a>  that point in time, Councilor Caraviello indicated during his first term, it was $1.2 million of school repairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=530.908s">We're</a>  now in excess of $1.5 million of school repairs, and we're getting ourselves right into the same position, I shouldn't say ourselves, the city is getting itself into this position <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=541.758s">of</a>  why we had to build new schools in the first place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=544.059s">If</a>  the upkeep is not going to be taking place, there is something wrong with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=549.401s">The</a>  building of a new police station, contained within the building of the new police station, it's 5,000 square feet less than what was asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=557.965s">There</a>  is no police firing range that is for qualification. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=563.208s">But</a>  more importantly, the sad part about the whole thing, no police vehicle is going to be able to be housed internally. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=568.91s">They're</a>  all going to be outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=571.365s">And</a>  by doing that, all you're doing is leaving all your public service vehicles open to the elements. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=577.03s">So</a>  if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be, every police officer's gonna have to go out there and take the snow off it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=582.034s">And</a>  you try to explain that to the people of this community and you tell them that you're spending close to $20 million for a new police station, but you have no place to house or at least care for your police cruisers. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=594.656s">A</a>  very important issue that seems to be lost in the weeds is the, at present, if not more, a $29 million unfunded pension liability that needs to be paid by 2029. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=606.781s">That</a>  is yet to be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=610.322s">Also,</a>  what needs to be addressed right now also is a citywide <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=616.474s">It's</a>  called the Citywide Home Water Meter Battery Replacement Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=621.317s">Now</a>  for those of you that have a house and you know when you get your water and sewer bill, the system was put in well over 10 years ago with meters that were only good for 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=631.523s">The</a>  10 years have come and gone, that's a cost factor and that's a replacement that needs to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=637.446s">We</a>  still have yet to receive a cost projection for a new fire station as to where it will be, when it will be, and what it will cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=646.17s">There</a>  is no projections out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=648.451s">And</a>  still outstanding is the new training tower that was promised it would be built before the old one was taken down. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=657.274s">Well,</a>  the old one has been taken down, and now nothing has been put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=662.116s">And</a>  in fact, it does affect, in the city of Medford, your home insurance rates. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=667.213s">There's</a>  no financial outline as to how the city's annual free cash should be prioritized. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=673.275s">For</a>  the new councils coming on board, for the last few many years, it's almost a million dollars each and every year the city of Medford has left over, it just goes into free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=682.278s">So</a>  that presents itself with one or two arguments. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=684.399s">Number</a>  one, the budget is either not accurate, or number two, that million dollars is maybe not correct when the budget is being voted upon at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=694.463s">So</a>  therefore, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=697.506s">To</a>  me, it makes very good sense because a lot of cities and towns do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=701.488s">You</a>  folks pass a budget in May or June, let's call it June, that should be the time you set your tax rate, not six months later. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=709.672s">So</a>  if you do that, you're working on an actual annual budget that reflects upon that vote that took place in June that represents itself to each and every dollar itemized. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=722.077s">Also,</a>  a public works five-year projection program that covers our streets, our sidewalks, our tree stumps, our equipment, our water repairs issues, and cemetery, as well as all personnel that's gonna be needed to address that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=737.109s">That</a>  would be a great program to have because number one, we're already understaffed and we're hiring immediately just two more people to work in the highway department that just basically on a daily basis is so understaffed and on demand. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=749.895s">Lastly,</a>  for the purposes of at least this portion of the discussion, two points. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=756.477s">And</a>  I know Councilor Caraviello once again has asked for this and Councilor Marks, you've asked for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=760.598s">You</a>  should get a five-year financial recap from Park Medford on all the receipts taken in and what has been given to the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=768.459s">I</a>  guarantee none of you have received anything from Park Medford as it relates to that financial responsibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=775.501s">And</a>  lastly, Councilor Marks, you brought this up, yet to be determined <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=779.182s">Where</a>  and for what reasons has the $500,000 from Tufts University been accounted for? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=785.185s">You</a>  still don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=786.245s">We</a>  still don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=788.186s">Now</a>  moving over to the housing issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=791.345s">And</a>  here's an issue right now that's in the forefront of everything as to what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=796.447s">So</a>  let's just mention a few little things that are going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=800.028s">Right</a>  now what we have on the books are 185 units that are coming online after Wendy's on Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=807.19s">You</a>  have 300 plus units opposite the Wellington Station. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=811.191s">You</a>  have a proposed 400 Chapter 40B units next to the Middlesex Courthouse on Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=818.553s">And</a>  looking at the smaller neighborhood issue that took place on Forest Street, where a private developer wanted to maximize a single-family residence to a multi-family use zone, that caused a tremendous amount of consultation not only to the neighborhood, but the Medford Historical Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=836.195s">Going</a>  back, you go to 61 Toro Street, where you had an old magnificent home over there for which Tufts University was involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=843.243s">And</a>  they sort of like wanted to take advantage of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=846.026s">But</a>  through the neighborhood pushing back, that didn't take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=850.475s">Right</a>  now, as of tomorrow night, you're going to have before the Board of Appeals, where the old Titan gas station is on Boston Avenue and Harvard Street, a condominium proposed development. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=861.519s">And</a>  then you have rumored development of a new condos behind the Middlesex Avenue Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=867.522s">Once</a>  again, a rumored development of 30 plus condos on South Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=872.784s">And</a>  a rumored Boston Avenue multi-housing development. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=878.123s">Then,</a>  at the end of last summer, 500 multi-use development was proposed by Combined Properties of Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=887.529s">And</a>  after a large community opposition, led by then City Councilor and now Mayor, Lungo-Koehn, as well as Gene Nuzzo and Cheryl Rodriguez, the project was forced to be scrapped by the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=904.521s">Now,</a>  some six months later, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=907.52s">This</a>  same company, Combined Properties, is now proposing a 37, 378 residential unit, and the application for approval is coming along under a Chapter 40B proposal, entirely different than what they originally had. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=924.773s">The</a>  real wake-up call to this whole issue right now on housing here in the City of Medford should have taken place at 61 Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=932.179s">The</a>  massive development that is opposite Wegmans right now, which was originally scheduled for over 500 units, and they've culled it down to 345. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=942.412s">Neighborhood</a>  protests pushed it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=945.033s">But</a>  as in any big business development, what did they do? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=949.075s">They</a>  went into the neighbors that were pushing back and they bought every single home over there for them to at least come back with $345,000 and still make the money that they're going to be made. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=960.103s">As</a>  I said some years ago, and as I said during this past campaign, the City of Medford needs to embark on a moratorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=967.685s">A</a>  moratorium on its zoning, and more importantly, a complete review of its zoning here in the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=975.207s">And</a>  the reason why the moratorium would work <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=978.311s">is</a>  because our zoning has not been reviewed for a multitude of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=982.653s">So</a>  you're saying to any proposed developer that comes in, I will propose this affordable housing, which is not the same as a Chapter 40B, because remember, affordable housing is something that's compensated in part or given great latitude by state laws, whereas a Chapter 40B is a private independent entity coming in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1004.523s">So</a>  sure, they'll give you their affordable housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1007.284s">but</a>  they'll back in the cost on the remaining units that are in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1011.186s">So</a>  how does that qualify and justify for an affordable housing process? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1015.489s">I</a>  don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1016.95s">But</a>  also, you should be looking into what they call a growth management proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1023.934s">And</a>  the reason why I say that is because we have right here in our own city, a sister city, it's called Malden, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1033.829s">And</a>  in 2015, they put a question on the ballot, and their ballot question revolved around what you have been talking about, Councilor Falco, the Malden Hospital, what we're going to do with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1045.737s">The</a>  second thing is the Community Preservation Act, what are we gonna do with that as far as open space? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1050.98s">And</a>  their third question was the moratorium on high-density, multi-level development. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1057.564s">It</a>  won by 71% of the vote, and they had a moratorium, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1063.834s">proposal</a>  that passed and it went from January of 2016 to December of 2017. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1068.516s">Now</a>  incorporated into that <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1076.522s">was</a>  the density of the immediate neighborhood taken into consideration, the height, the number of units, as well as the zoning exemptions that were being challenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1087.07s">And</a>  as a result of that, they have now, I think if you go to them all, then you can be able to see, if you look at their development office, I don't know if they call it Office of Community Development, they do have a serious situation where they had developers just coming in all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1102.765s">Medford</a>  has a serious problem in having a workable business community, a business development community. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1110.249s">Approximately</a>  10.2% of the business in this community is commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1115.171s">Who</a>  bears the rest of that brunt? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1117.172s">It's</a>  the residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1118.553s">And</a>  I know every time when you folks turn around and do your budget, you talk about a residential factor making it the highest or the lowest or whatever it might be, you're still putting the burden <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1127.998s">on</a>  the taxpayer who owns his residential home, and you're not taking the exemption for the out-of-state person. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1133.761s">So,</a>  with that being said, and if we continue to go on this road, or this, how can you say, this road, so to speak, of not increasing our commercial base, all you're going to do is just going to be commercial, I mean, raising in the future your residential rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1148.628s">Now,</a>  after what took place in Malden, and after what took place after that, we can switch ourselves over to the city of,</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1156.636s">Mr.</a>  Penta, you have one minute remaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1159.23s">Just</a>  want to let you know.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1161.081s">You</a>  want somebody else to talk?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1162.202s">No,</a>  you have 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1162.863s">Your</a>  10 minutes is just about up.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1164.744s">OK,</a>  well, I'm on my last page. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1166.526s">I'm</a>  on my last page.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1167.526s">Yep,</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1167.927s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1168.767s">So</a>  after Malden, beside Malden, in 2015, the city of Revere, and again in 2018, put that question of a moratorium, high density, multi-use positions over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1179.916s">And</a>  their situation over there revolved itself around large scale buildings, traffic, public safety, schools, and roads were going to be at issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1188.163s">And</a>  the claims that Revere was not growing geographically, but rather becoming more dense without any economic development is just like what's going on right here in our city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1200.088s">And</a>  with that being said, that the challenge for affordable housing in Chapter 40B as we speak today, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1205.43s">would</a>  be the luxury of using our at-present zoning laws and skirt around the real issue of reasonably priced housing and rental. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1214.596s">There</a>  are two or three companies in the United States that take into effect low-moderate housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1221.3s">Veterans</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1223.098s">middle-income</a>  people, but not high-end middle-income people, middle-income people, and that's a determination by a professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1229.963s">We</a>  don't have that expertise over here, and I know on the ballot here tonight, on our agenda, there's a question regarding Chapter 40B, but if you really look at just Chapter 40B, and you realize that developer is not there to lose money, and he's putting housing in a densely populated area, you're violating all the reasoning of why a neighborhood should be a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1253.438s">And</a>  as a result of that, moratoriums does not have to go on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1257.602s">A</a>  moratorium can be placed by this council, by this mayor, or jointly together. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1262.266s">And</a>  recognizing the fact, and recognizing the fact, we are a city just as running, allowing housing to be any place and everywhere at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1270.152s">And</a>  because of that, that's not good. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1272.054s">That's</a>  not healthy for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1274.136s">As</a>  I said before a long time ago, development for the sake of development isn't the best thing that can happen in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1279.58s">We</a>  have schools, we have public safety, we have public works. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1282.822s">We</a>  have a whole host of issues that taxpayers have to increasingly pay for. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1287.005s">And</a>  our best example of that is when they talked about stations landing, that they said at that point in time, that was going to lower our tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1293.909s">Well,</a>  the tax rate has never gone down once since station landing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1297.271s">As</a>  a matter of fact, it just continuously goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1300.794s">I'd</a>  be more than happy to answer any questions, but I just think it's important to have brought this up, especially for our two new councils, but more importantly for all seven of you, because this administration and you as a new council needs to address issues that basically address these matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1318.0s">They</a>  haven't been addressed, and they need to be addressed, and you just can't sit here and say, okay, we'll get to it someday, because someday has already come. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1327.983s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1331.362s">Larry,</a>  could you, I made copies of my comments for all of your Councilors, so in case you missed anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1341.869s">The</a>  part that I appreciated the most when I served on this board for 36 years was the fact that I was willing to hear opposite viewpoints. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1351.193s">But</a>  when it comes to finances, two and two equals four. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1355.534s">And</a>  when it comes to neighborhoods, the people who live in the neighborhood should come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1360.056s">Not</a>  out-of-towners, not developers who want to come in there and make a whole bunch of money and then leave us. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1365.958s">Perfect</a>  example is Lumineer on Locust Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1369.139s">They</a>  built the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1370.7s">They</a>  said they were going to stay there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1372.201s">They</a>  went to the Board of Appeals to get what they had to. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1374.762s">And</a>  one year later, they sold off the building and made $62 million at the expense of the Medford taxpayer. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1382.327s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I thank you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1384.868s">And</a>  if there's any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1387.79s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1389.551s">Any</a>  questions from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1393.453s">Any</a>  questions?</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1395.594s">Can</a>  I ask a question?</p>

    <p>[WYTf73F7sag_SPEAKER_13]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1398.456s">That</a>  guy there looks like Ted Cruz. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1402.24s">He's</a>  got a new addition.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1408.323s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Penta. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1409.123s">If</a>  we could please have your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Starella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1411.544s">Yes,</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1412.784s">My</a>  name is John Starella, and I reside on Metcalfe Street here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1418.086s">I</a>  just want to give you my idea of what Councilor Penta referred to free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1425.209s">And</a>  I want to give you my idea of what free cash is, and I'd like to know whether or not you agree with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1431.891s">I</a>  see free cash as a slush fund. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1434.592s">I</a>  mean, when we pass, say, for instance, an expenditure, we always overestimate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1441.014s">And</a>  that's done intentionally, because what is left over from the overestimate is put into free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1450.557s">And</a>  that sits there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1452.597s">And</a>  when... <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1454.767s">the</a>  council or any councilor needs a special project, we pay for it out of free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1463.372s">And</a>  it passes easily because it's free. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1468.995s">What</a>  do you think of that, Mr. President?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1472.157s">What</a>  do you think of that? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1473.398s">I</a>  think the name is horrible that they call it free cash. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1476.159s">Nothing's</a>  free. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1476.98s">I</a>  mean, I disagree with the name of it, without a doubt.</p>

    <p>[Starella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1481.082s">But</a>  is that the purpose of free cash, to have a slush fund?</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1485.615s">I</a>  wouldn't think so, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1487.255s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Starella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1488.236s">Well,</a>  that's where you get your money when you have a project later on in the term. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1492.936s">You</a>  can take it right out of free cash and no one objects to it because it's free. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1498.657s">Quote,</a>  unquote. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1500.218s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1500.838s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1501.798s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1505.719s">Any</a>  other questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1508.159s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1576.343s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1577.424s">So</a>  I do apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1578.385s">So</a>  the current minimum for Medford is actually $40,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1580.407s">In</a>  a last session, this body <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1585.379s">Adjusted</a>  the interest rate and also at some point that cap was adjusted I found some pages on the website that need to be updated with the current cap But even at that level of $40,000 for the income cap Medford still lags behind surrounding cities in this state program So for people that don't know this is a state program that Medford takes part in that allows residents who meet certain criteria And are over the age of 65 to defer their property taxes until their house is sold or they pass away <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1616.283s">Medford</a>  like every other municipality has to set an income cap on this and an interest rate as I said The interest rate was lower to 5% last session and I think the members of this body who helped to pass that But in regards to the income cap at $40,000 For context Somerville's limit is 57,000 Cambridge is 53,000 and it should be noted that both of these communities have owner occupied exemptions, which we do not have in Medford, so I <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1642.702s">As</a>  far as kind of tools in our tools box to help people who need it to get relief from their property taxes were really limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1650.484s">So</a>  I think it's important that we make sure we're at the highest level allowed by the state so that as many people who do wish to take part in this program can. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1659.486s">I</a>  think I check with the chief assessor the city assessor. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1663.267s">Believe</a>  only two households currently take part in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1665.448s">So</a>  I understand it's not for everyone with the interest rates and the way the interest rate actually Changes at the time of the owner passing away or being sold But the state does allow us to raise this cap to the senior circuit breaker tax credit And I do understand that other communities rather than having to come back to this income cap time and again They're wording it such that this program is <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1690.851s">in</a>  their city is for people who meet the requirements with income not exceeding the state cap calculated under Clause 41A of Section 5 of Chapter 59. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1699.625s">So</a>  that's something that as the state adjusts, Medford would adjust along with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1704.348s">So</a>  I'm raising this now and my motion is to send this to Committee of the Whole in either February or March so it's something that we can have the city assessor come out and explain to us how this program, if more people were to take part in this at this higher income cap or other potential caps, how it would just affect cash flow so that we can look at that during budget time as we have these, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1729.693s">Meetings</a>  hopefully earlier, as we discussed already in this meeting, and I'd also like to add a beat paper so that when that rate is set, this does go up as a notice in the next property tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1742.483s">The</a>  deadline to apply for this program is April 1st, so it would be hard for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1748.027s">We</a>  can't do it this time around, but knowing when this rate is set. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1750.905s">just</a>  so people are aware of this program because it is a program from the state that people around the state take part in. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1757.11s">And</a>  I want to make sure that Medford residents do know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1761.133s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1763.915s">If</a>  you could, um, if you could just help with the clerk, if you could give him the wording to the B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1768.398s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1769.679s">Um,</a>  so when this, when we set or <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1772.915s">Whether</a>  we stay with the current cap, if we pick a new cap, whatever it is, after we have this committee of the whole, that we include a notice of this program the next time property tax bills are sent out.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1797.751s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1802.612s">Would</a>  you like to make a comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1803.853s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1805.714s">Yeah,</a>  William Navarre, Apartment 1B, Medford Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1811.918s">Sorry,</a>  108 Medford Street, Apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1816.161s">I</a>  wanted to speak a little bit about this and how it relates to the philosophy of taxation. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1821.104s">I</a>  wanted to say that land is opportunity and taxes on land are therefore taxes on opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1828.427s">But</a>  unlike most taxes, which are only paid when the opportunity is exploited, taxes on land are paid whether the opportunities are squandered or exploited. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1837.834s">Taxes</a>  on land, therefore, discourage folks buying up land in order to charge a high price to future folks wanting to access the opportunities available on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1847.601s">Real</a>  estate taxes are the only tax I know of in the Commonwealth that tax land at all, and they are therefore the best type of tax collected in this Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1859.241s">But</a>  those who support taxes on land have, for over 100 years, been thought to be on a mission to tax elderly widows out of their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1868.033s">In</a>  1909, Winston Churchill had already heard it a million times. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1871.397s">You</a>  might not be aware that Winston Churchill supported the form of taxation I've been advocating to you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1878.561s">He</a>  said then that the personality of the widow has been used to exhaustion. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1883.927s">It</a>  would be sweating in the cruelest sense of the word, over time of the grossest description, to bring the widow out again so soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1891.494s">She</a>  must have a rest for a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1894.698s">Therefore,</a>  since I'm advocating for that form of text, I feel this is a really good opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1900.97s">to</a>  rise in support of the deferral programs in the strongest possible terms and support increasing its income limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1907.681s">This</a>  proposal will allow our seniors to age in place and enjoy their homes if that's what they choose, not tax widows out of their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1916.684s">And</a>  this I should make very clear I understand is not a handout of any kind to our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1921.268s">It</a>  is not even a social safety net or a form of charity. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1924.811s">Seniors</a>  are still well incentivized to downsize their land use if they wish to leave a larger estate to their heirs. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1933.398s">The</a>  tax deferrals merely give seniors more flexibility on how to use the assets that they have worked hard to build up over the years by paying their taxes deferred with their property. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1945.939s">I</a>  hope the seniors who are able to remain in our community under the deferment program will remain allies in my calls for more intensive land use that will provide access to urban opportunities for people of all ages as our city grows. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1959.321s">I</a>  hope they'll support my calls for higher taxes on land and lower taxes on buildings, and that they'll support my calls for fewer parking mandates. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1967.283s">I</a>  want to reiterate, in the strongest possible terms, that I support tax deferral programs and I do not hope for increased <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1974.224s">land</a>  taxes or real estate taxes to tax anyone out of their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1977.725s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1978.706s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1980.046s">Councilor</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1982.287s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1983.788s">I</a>  don't know, possible and also making sure that with only two households using this, I mean, that might be that people don't want to. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=1997.233s">My</a>  people be that people don't know that the cap was raised to 40,000 recently. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2001.114s">I</a>  think there's a lot of information questions there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2003.315s">So</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2004.413s">I</a>  just strongly support this motion and the B paper.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2007.875s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2009.095s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2010.135s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2011.476s">Last</a>  term when this council did adopt the increase from $20,000 to $40,000, which passed unanimously before the body, we raised a question to the city assessor asking her to conduct a cost analysis and feasibility study of adopting the state maximum. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2028.242s">She</a>  reported back to us, I believe, right around the time we were setting the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2033.517s">that</a>  she was still working on that document. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2036.1s">So</a>  I'd just like to add the paper that the council had adopted back in March of 2019, I'm sorry, May of 2019, I believe it was either the 20th or the 28th in that meeting, making that request. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2048.192s">And</a>  add that to the agenda as part of the discussion, Mr. President, because if we're going to make a decision about this type of issue that's going to have a certain impact on our finances here in the community, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2058.48s">then</a>  at the very least we need to have a feasibility study or a cost impact analysis done so that we have an understanding of what impact it's going to have on the bottom line in the community.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2066.983s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2067.723s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2069.164s">So</a>  my motion would be to join that paper.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2070.844s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2073.285s">You</a>  want to join?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2074.086s">To</a>  include it as part of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2075.386s">It</a>  doesn't necessarily have to be joined to this paper tonight, but when the meeting is conducted, that it's conducted when we have the cost analysis and feasibility study.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2083.269s">Yes,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2084.38s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2085.581s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2087.223s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2088.063s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Morell for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2091.427s">I</a>  remember last year's discussions and at the time I believe it was two or three people that took advantage of the tax deferral program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2099.987s">And</a>  at the time when we were discussing of raising the income levels and also lowering the interest rate, we thought by taking a step by lowering it from 8% to 5%, we'd see if we attracted more people. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2115.793s">Was</a>  that more attractive to people that possibly wanted to do a deferral? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2121.154s">And</a>  I think it's too soon to tell now, but over the next several months, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2125.996s">We</a>  should see if that was somewhat successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2129.137s">And</a>  I agree the next logical step is increasing the income levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2134.299s">So</a>  I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2135.68s">I</a>  also want to put out there that this is one of several programs that seniors could take advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2143.254s">The</a>  other program that we have is the state circuit breaker tax credit program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2148.679s">And</a>  that's been around for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2150.921s">It's</a>  100% through the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2153.943s">So</a>  it's not a city run program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2156.686s">And</a>  based on how it works is when your tax bill exceeds 10% of your total income, you qualify. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2166.343s">So</a>  it's 10% of your total income, you qualify this for this particular program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2171.887s">And</a>  for the tax year 2019, the amount that you would qualify for is $1,130. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2177.051s">So</a>  if any senior out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2182.195s">is</a>  interested, you have to apply for it when you do your taxes, which are coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2187.317s">This</a>  is an ideal time to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2190.038s">And</a>  that's when you would apply for this through the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2192.998s">And</a>  you would have to follow their rules and regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2195.219s">But</a>  that more or less is, in a nutshell, how do you apply for it and who's eligible. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2203.001s">The</a>  other one is the regular statutory exemptions that we have currently in this city right now for, I believe, veterans, disabled, the blind, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2212.071s">and</a>  also seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2213.714s">And</a>  there may be another one. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2214.535s">I</a>  think there may be five or six exemptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2217.503s">And</a>  the one that I'm speaking about, Mr. President, this council back many years ago, through my resolution, lowered the age from 70 to 65, which actually helped thousands of people take advantage of it, that five-year gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2231.248s">And</a>  that's something I'm proud of that we did many, many years ago to help seniors in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2237.031s">But</a>  the senior exemption, Mr. President, and this is something we have to look up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2241.192s">It's</a>  set up statutorily. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2243.22s">So</a>  we can't raise the income levels, but we can ask our state delegation, which we ask a lot of things, if they would look at it on a state level, Mr. President, because depending on where you live, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2257.24s">in</a>  Massachusetts, these income levels are way out of whack. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2261.041s">So</a>  for instance, your income to be eligible for the senior statutory property tax exemption is not to exceed $24,758 if you're single or $37,137 if you're married. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2281.035s">So</a>  those are the two income levels that you can't exceed to be currently eligible for a $1,000 exemption in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2289.244s">The</a>  one nice thing about this program is we get paid for a portion of what we give in exemption back by the state through our cherry sheets. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2298.95s">So</a>  we actually get something in back. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2300.451s">So</a>  actually, we should be promoting this for our seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2304.013s">They're</a>  getting $1,000, and we're also getting somewhat reimbursed. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2307.715s">So</a>  we're not fully losing out the $1,000 on our tax roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2311.597s">So</a>  it's a win-win for the resident and also for the city, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2316.52s">And</a>  also, there's the income level I just mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2320.902s">And</a>  regarding estates, you cannot exceed, if you're single, $40,000 in estate revenue or worth and $55,000 for married. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2334.449s">And</a>  this does not count your domicile. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2336.51s">So</a>  it does not count where you live. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2338.211s">So</a>  if you have other assets and so forth that are above the $40,000 for single and $55,000, that's also another criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2346.001s">But</a>  this program, I believe hundreds of Medford residents, I can't remember the last count, take advantage of this program every year, Mr. President, and count on it because of the way taxes are going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2357.666s">But</a>  as I mentioned at the beginning, $24,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2359.587s">If</a>  someone's making $24,000 and they want to rent in the city of Medford, you wouldn't be renting in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2368.07s">You</a>  wouldn't be able to afford anything else but possibly your rent. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2372.901s">So</a>  these numbers are way out of whack. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2375.062s">Maybe</a>  if you're living out in Fall River or maybe in Springfield, that may swing it for a single person out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2382.086s">Who</a>  knows? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2382.586s">Maybe</a>  not. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2383.827s">But</a>  around here, it doesn't, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2386.208s">And</a>  I would ask that we as a council, because this has been an issue for years, and it does go up incrementally every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2394.753s">So</a>  it went up from last year, it was 24,000, it might have been 24,100 rather than 24,700. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2400.876s">So</a>  it does go up a certain percentage every year, but it's not enough to be eligible to the masses, which I think in this day and age we all want to get to because many seniors like my mother and many other mothers in here, they may be property rich, but they're money poor. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2419.529s">They</a>  don't have the fluidity of having money. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2422.792s">They</a>  have a house that's worth something they bought years and years ago, but they don't have the cash to pay for the taxes and everything else that goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2430.237s">The</a>  cable bill and you name it, everything goes up every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2433.44s">So</a>  these are important things that seniors that are low income, seniors in our community need to take advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2442.187s">And</a>  if we can do anything, like Councilor Morell mentioned, about increasing the income and asset levels, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2449.512s">I</a>  think we should be promoting that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2451.193s">So</a>  I want to thank the Council.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2453.014s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2458.878s">Please</a>  have your name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Starella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2461.039s">John</a>  Stirella of Metcalfe Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2463.981s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2465.261s">And</a>  I want to tell Councilor Morell that I do support your resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2475.027s">But</a>  I would like, if you can, to quantify it for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2480.754s">as</a>  it stands today. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2482.455s">I</a>  mean, as it's practiced today, can you quantify it? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2488.219s">What</a>  is it costing? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2491.541s">In</a>  other words, well, I've heard that only six people are in the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2497.865s">Is</a>  that true?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2498.906s">I</a>  heard, the number I got from the assessor this week was two households.</p>

    <p>[Starella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2504.609s">Two.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2505.009s">I</a>  beg your pardon? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2505.77s">Two.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2506.05s">Two.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2506.79s">There</a>  are only two people in the program? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2508.231s">Two</a>  households, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2510.353s">Well,</a>  what are we talking about here? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2513.034s">I</a>  mean, the average tax, say, is $6,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2518.558s">Now,</a>  as I understand, this counts somewhere else as a deferment, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2523.82s">Now,</a>  deferment means you pay nothing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2526.822s">It</a>  defers the whole cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2528.323s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2529.724s">Well,</a>  this comes only to, say, $6,000, $6,000 on an average. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2531.765s">$12,000</a>  is what we're talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2538.164s">Now,</a>  when you shift that, say, for instance, to the rest of the population, pardon me, when you shift that to the rest of the population, there are 17,000 parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2554.528s">You</a>  divide the 17,000 into the 12,000, and you get the added cost to the rest of the population of something like a dollar a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2567.022s">This</a>  is ridiculous. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2567.963s">We're</a>  talking about a dollar a year to 17,000 people in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2574.367s">They'll</a>  gladly pay it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2576.969s">But</a>  this amounts to nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2578.41s">Actually,</a>  when you consider that we have a $183 million budget, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2582.393s">But</a>  we don't spend $183 million, do we? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2593.459s">No,</a>  we spend more. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2595.66s">We</a>  spend something like $200 million, and we do that every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2602.082s">So</a>  I don't know why this subject is even brought up, because it amounts to nothing, nothing at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2610.185s">I</a>  would like to see it improved.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2611.485s">Point</a>  of information, Consular Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2616.12s">I</a>  can hear what Dr. Streller is mentioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2618.422s">At</a>  this point, because there's only two households taking advantage of this, what we're trying to do, doctor, is increase the number of participants by lowering the interest rate from 8% to 5%, making it more attractive, by increasing the income levels to make it more attractive. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2635.913s">And</a>  by the way, that dollar a piece that you're talking about, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2641.417s">has</a>  to be realized every year, but we're also getting an interest off this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2648.062s">So</a>  the people that are doing the deferment, if you have roughly an $8,000 tax rate, you're going to be paying $400 eventually when you settle up on that every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2661.474s">So</a>  really, it's going to come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2665.431s">It's</a>  not really paid out by the people that aren't taking the deferment because we're gonna get it back through the deferral. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2673.134s">But</a>  what we're trying to do is increase the number of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2675.975s">So</a>  right now, you're right, it's marginal because there's only two people taking advantage. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2680.476s">But</a>  that's not the intent, to keep it marginal.</p>

    <p>[Starella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2682.897s">It</a>  is, but even if you increase it by 100%, now you'll have four people on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2689.399s">I</a>  mean, this is a ridiculous discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2692.168s">So</a>  let's dispense with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2694.63s">But</a>  I do agree with you that, when you gave your example about senior citizens who are house rich but dollar poor, well, that's the reason I think that this council must definitely put in a tax reduction this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2716.223s">Now</a>  our tax comes to, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2722.045s">My</a>  God, my mind is... What is our tax now? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2729.589s">It's...</a>  9.15. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2729.889s">Yeah,</a>  well, that's the rate.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2735.312s">But</a>  I was thinking that the tax should be reduced from...</p>

    <p>[Starella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2753.062s">Oh</a>  my God. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2754.543s">You</a>  see what you guys got to look forward to? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2761.487s">But</a>  anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2763.115s">Our</a>  tax should be reduced, I say, to 14, like we're paying now $18,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2770.742s">It</a>  should be reduced to $14,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2774.244s">And</a>  not only that, if we reduce the taxes, now you must consider this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2778.188s">This</a>  is very important because you've got to do this before June 30th. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2781.931s">Now,</a>  we know what's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2783.592s">You're</a>  going to be presented with a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2787.139s">On</a>  June 29th, you've got to pass it in a hurry. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2789.922s">You're</a>  not going to consider the only power you have, which is to reduce taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2794.666s">But</a>  that's what you must do. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2796.747s">Because</a>  reducing taxes will increase revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2801.812s">Now,</a>  that sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2804.334s">But</a>  that's what the federal government did, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2808.778s">The</a>  federal government reduced taxes, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2811.64s">And</a>  guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2812.611s">revenue</a>  increase because other taxes are paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2816.172s">When</a>  consumers have more money, they spend more money. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2818.854s">When</a>  they spend more money, that increases other taxes, and that's what will happen to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2824.336s">So</a>  we've got to reduce taxes, and that's the way we'll help people like your mother. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2831.959s">If</a>  you reduce taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2833.139s">Now,</a>  this tax reduction is so successful that within the next 90 days, the president is considering reducing federal taxes again. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2844.264s">He</a>  expects to get more revenue from that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2848.067s">So,</a>  I hope you consider this very, very carefully. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2852.93s">You</a>  must not, again, increase taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2856.593s">Because</a>  when you look at this agenda here, practically every one of these resolutions is a tax increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2865.139s">Like,</a>  for instance, I was talking to one of the councilors here about these bins. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2871.152s">Well,</a>  what he wants to do, he wants to charge a fee for having a bin. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2875.713s">That</a>  fee is a tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2877.093s">Here</a>  we go again. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2878.394s">And</a>  that tax translates into revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2882.835s">And</a>  the council loves the revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2885.395s">Because</a>  the revenue is how we pay all of the 80%, by the way, 80% of our revenue is spent on compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2899.858s">The</a>  whole thing has to be reconsidered. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2901.939s">But,</a>  believe it or not, as ironic as it sounds, a tax reduction will help the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2911.105s">The</a>  people of Medford who we all want to serve, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2916.108s">And</a>  many of us would do it for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2918.049s">We'd</a>  be happy to do it for nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2921.091s">And</a>  we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2922.192s">Many</a>  of us do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2924.273s">We</a>  give to the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2927.015s">We</a>  don't expect compensation. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2929.195s">We</a>  don't want them. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2930.936s">And</a>  many people have served. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2933.757s">Many</a>  people have put their lives at risk. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2937.618s">Who</a>  would put his life at risk and then not even get paid adequately for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2946.962s">I</a>  remember when I was in the service, I was paid $80 as an ensign. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2951.164s">And</a>  that $80, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2958.891s">was</a>  not every week. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2961.492s">It</a>  was every two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2963.492s">So</a>  I was getting $160 a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2966.093s">I</a>  was happy to get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2967.753s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2977.576s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushman Street, East Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2982.517s">Not</a>  to put words in my friend, Dr. Starella, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=2987.236s">in</a>  his repertoire of words, but I think he's implying if you walk the streets, we'll tax your feet, because I'm the tax man, quote the Beatles. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3000.082s">First</a>  of all, I want to thank Councilor Morell, Councilor Marks, and others, and ex-Councilor Penta for bringing up this housing and affordability situation the way I'm comprehending it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3013.331s">And</a>  Councilor Marks brought up a good point that I found out about 20 years ago when my mother was doing income taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3021.714s">And</a>  he brought up, I believe it's actually called a circuit breaker under the Massachusetts income tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3028.096s">And</a>  a lot of people don't know about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3032.337s">And</a>  believe it or not, some accountants that do taxes don't know about it also. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3037.819s">Scary</a>  thought, but I've caught a few of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3042.649s">I</a>  believe the formula is, on a Massachusetts return, they take your real estate tax and your water bill, or a portion thereof, and they take 10% of your adjusted gross income, and then they do the mathematics, and if you're above, in other words, you're hurting, you would get dollar for dollar, mind you. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3066.713s">up</a>  to the max of, like you said, about $1,100, I guess it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3070.755s">Haven't</a>  looked at it since my mother's been gone for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3074.037s">But</a>  thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3075.058s">Also,</a>  what you failed to mention was, it not only applies to people who pay real estate taxes in houses that they live in, it also applies to renters, which I was surprised to read in the law, unless the law has changed since 12 years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3094.278s">However,</a>  in Andrew's gut opinion, there's only one surefire way to help the owner-occupied people that live in their houses in Medford is to adopt the Commonwealth of Massachusetts owner-occupied real estate tax exemption. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3116.355s">And</a>  it's called, if you want to look it up, Chapter 59, Section 5C. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3122.58s">And</a>  in my estimation, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3124.807s">The</a>  average owner, average I'm saying, would save about $2,000 a year off their real estate tax bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3135.617s">I've</a>  been asking for nine and a half years. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3139.04s">It</a>  will be done someday. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3140.241s">I</a>  may not see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3142.943s">And</a>  if it's done, it's in perpetuity.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3151.465s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3156.308s">I</a>  heard some mention of the Laffer curve, which is the name of the curve that you can reduce the tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3161.831s">You'll</a>  have more economic activity going on, and then your revenue will go up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3165.193s">That's</a>  called the Laffer curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3166.353s">It</a>  was put forth during the Reagan administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3169.315s">And</a>  there's been some debate on whether or not it's true in the federal tax regime that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3176.199s">And</a>  so the economists go back and forth on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3180.916s">But</a>  I could probably invite the council to guess one area where we're very certain the Laffer curve does not apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3186.941s">And</a>  that would be land. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3192.126s">Will</a>  Rogers said, buy land, they ain't making any more of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3196.469s">Well,</a>  the fact is, if you raise the tax on land, nobody's going to destroy it either in order to avoid having to pay the tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3202.363s">You</a>  have a nice building, somebody jacks up the tax rate, maybe you'll pull the building down, you won't have to pay the tax no more. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3207.884s">You</a>  can't pull land down. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3209.705s">You</a>  can't build land, you can't create it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3211.405s">It's</a>  impossible for the owner to create or destroy to affect the amount they're paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3214.486s">So</a>  if you shift the tax to land, it'd be very similar to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3219.067s">People</a>  make the place better, they'll build more buildings. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3223.108s">Medford</a>  will be a better place to live, the land will become more valuable, you can tax it more. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3227.678s">The</a>  Laffer Curve cannot possibly apply to land, because it's perfectly inelastic good. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3233.783s">It</a>  cannot be created or destroyed by us mere mortals. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3237.066s">It</a>  was created by nature, and we're kind of stuck with the amount we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3240.429s">So</a>  that's one reason you should tax land. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3242.911s">No</a>  Laffer Curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3243.712s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3244.332s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3250.898s">Jean</a>  Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3254.997s">I'm</a>  going to give you guys an analogy, and I think this is a great idea, but it's the equivalent of putting a bucket under a flood. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3262.6s">When</a>  you have a deluge of water, you want to turn off the source or turn down the source to help alleviate what the issue is. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3271.638s">We</a>  continue to look at, and it's admirable for the short term, but it doesn't resolve the issue for the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3278.003s">And</a>  what it does is turn our government into a bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3282.687s">So</a>  we're saying to people, if you owe money and you can't pay it, we'll alleviate that debt temporarily by way of deferment and charge you 5% interest or 8% interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3293.576s">And</a>  so now we're a bank as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3296.698s">If</a>  we look at how <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3299.153s">we</a>  are planning our city and assure that we are doing things to increase our commercial tax base, what we are doing is creating new revenues of income stream so that we don't have to continue to increase real estate. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3314.666s">And</a>  I strongly object to the idea that we should tax land so that it's more valuable, because increasing the value of real estate is everything that is wrong with the housing market and is the core problem of why housing is so unaffordable, because it's become an investment opportunity and ceased to be a place where people live. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3337.148s">If</a>  you look back in years past, when real estate was divided between commercial, which was investment opportunity, and residential, which was a place where you lived, housing was not inflated the way it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3353.044s">So</a>  I would caution you that when we talk about these academic things, you should look at how <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3359.23s">things</a>  have come to pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3361.411s">And</a>  inflating the cost of land does nothing to help keep elderly people in their home or marginalized people in their home or allow for opportunities to people to be able to afford a piece of property or an apartment or a condo if they so choose to purchase into that American dream. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3381.761s">So</a>  with that said, I would <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3384.162s">You</a>  know, laud the fact that we're looking at these things, but we really should be thinking about the source too, and it starts with really good and solid urban planning that takes into consideration those multiple avenues that afford us the opportunity to balance for our residents their real estate tax. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3401.433s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3402.154s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3405.036s">I'm</a>  gonna be quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3406.176s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3407.257s">108</a>  Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3411.314s">I</a>  wanted to clarify, because that was a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3414.217s">I'm</a>  really excited to hear it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3416.999s">There's</a>  a slight difference when we talk about land between price and value, because the price of a land is the, we want that to be low, because the price represents the, <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3435.356s">sorry,</a>  capitalized value of the residual, that is the rent of the land minus the tax, gets capitalized into a price, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3446.583s">So</a>  the price of the land refers to that, the value of land actually refers to the rent of the land, and that is the difference, how productive the land is, how useful it is, how much of a blessing it is to whoever gets to occupy it. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3459.755s">That's</a>  different from the price of the lead, which represents the value that if you were to sell it today, sell the right to that lead into perpetuity. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3471.62s">That's</a>  the piece you're investing on. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3473.12s">And</a>  actually, I totally agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3476.789s">You</a>  do not want to increase the price of the land. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3480.05s">Increasing</a>  the sale price of the land is the exact opposite of what a land value tax does, and is the exact opposite of what real estate taxes do. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3487.971s">We</a>  know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3488.511s">If</a>  you raise any of the taxes on the real estate, on the land, whatever, the price goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3493.392s">We</a>  want the price to go down. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3494.572s">That's</a>  distinct from what we mean when we say the value goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3498.193s">Those</a>  are two different ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3499.493s">Because</a>  value is based on location. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3500.913s">If</a>  you make the location better, the value goes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/puRJAp7j8rg&t=3503.374s">But</a>  the price doesn't have to if the taxes also go up.</p>
