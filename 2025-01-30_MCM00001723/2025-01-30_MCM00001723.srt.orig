1
00:00:00,762 --> 00:00:02,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:02,302 --> 00:00:06,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Welcome to the City of Medford Conservation Commission meeting for January 29th, 2025.

3
00:00:06,743 --> 00:00:11,904
[SPEAKER_04]: Heidi, if you want to do, we'll call it again.

4
00:00:17,985 --> 00:00:18,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly.

5
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,666
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe we are going to start with 28 Sycamore.

6
00:00:23,546 --> 00:00:25,767
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a continuation of our last hearing.

7
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:41,946
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a revised plan, and so if the proponent's representative could just walk us through those revisions, it would be appreciated.

8
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:58,870
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, just as a note, once we hear from the representative of commission, we'll deliberate, and then we will open comments to the general public, and then we'll turn it back to the commission.

9
00:00:59,750 --> 00:00:59,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

10
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:06,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you, Madam Chairman, for the record, Rick Salvo with Engineering Alliance.

11
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:12,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just get to my screen.

12
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:27,668
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did submit a revised plan based on comments and discussions at last week's hearing, and really appreciate the commission taking the time to schedule a special meeting sort of out of sequence here.

13
00:01:28,868 --> 00:01:38,892
[SPEAKER_03]: What we've done is we've eliminated two of the parking spaces to allow enough room for us to be able to retain the two 36-inch trees.

14
00:01:38,972 --> 00:01:41,093
[SPEAKER_03]: We now have a total of 12 parking spaces.

15
00:01:48,235 --> 00:01:52,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the previous plan said 15, but in fact, there were only 14 spaces shown on it.

16
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:55,820
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a reduction in parking spaces for 12 parking spaces.

17
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:06,646
[SPEAKER_03]: We tried to scatter the trees around, being mindful of where the existing trees are located to stick them in areas where they'll have the best chance of success.

18
00:02:07,587 --> 00:02:09,768
[SPEAKER_03]: We swapped out the Norway

19
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:30,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Maple for the Inkberry and we also submitted the O&M plan and we added tree protection, our tree protection section to the O&M plan to protect the existing trees that are in the area.

20
00:02:33,185 --> 00:02:36,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Those were the changes that we had discussed and that's the new material that we've submitted.

21
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

22
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Steltzner.

23
00:02:44,547 --> 00:02:45,828
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, back to the commission.

24
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:48,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Have you all had a chance to look at this revised plan?

25
00:02:52,454 --> 00:02:54,075
[SPEAKER_12]: And do you have any comments?

26
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:07,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Salvo, thank you for providing the updated plan and incorporating the comments that we've made.

27
00:03:08,773 --> 00:03:18,483
[SPEAKER_14]: On the O&M plan, have you received any of the preliminary comments that we provided since you sent that?

28
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Unfortunately, I have not.

29
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:23,603
[SPEAKER_14]: We can talk about them tonight.

30
00:03:23,623 --> 00:03:34,472
[SPEAKER_14]: A couple of things that I would like to see incorporated here relative to the reestablishment of planting.

31
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:38,336
[SPEAKER_14]: The first would be some description of

32
00:03:41,123 --> 00:04:06,558
[SPEAKER_14]: a sort of monitoring and assurance that the seeding that's going to happen in the compensatory storage area, that it be evaluated and then monitored and, you know, to ensure that it establishes and that if at the end of a growing period, sorry, I'm trying to find my notes because I wrote this out.

33
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:20,851
[SPEAKER_14]: That any areas that are not established that are still bare earth be receded to make sure that we get good full coverage of that seating.

34
00:04:24,516 --> 00:04:25,116
[SPEAKER_14]: The other.

35
00:04:27,047 --> 00:04:29,709
[SPEAKER_14]: comment is more specific to the O&M plan.

36
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:38,176
[SPEAKER_14]: I think when we have areas of disturbance like this, particularly in wet areas, there's a lot of pressure for invasive plants to grow there.

37
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:47,444
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd like to see in the O&M plan a process for monitoring the presence of common invasive plant species.

38
00:04:47,504 --> 00:04:49,906
[SPEAKER_14]: And we can provide you with a website that has that.

39
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:55,290
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the removal of any observed invasive plants, the ones that I'm

40
00:04:56,631 --> 00:05:11,094
[SPEAKER_14]: most cognizant of in this area are Japanese knotweed, oriental bittersweet, garlic mustard, and phragmites, and that there be steps to prevent further spread of those invasive plants.

41
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:16,276
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's both important for the resource area and the ecology of this.

42
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:25,358
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it also addresses some of the concerns of the neighbors about plants spreading into their properties from this site.

43
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:39,529
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and I think that type of invasive plant management and monitoring is becoming more and more common in restoration projects and things like that.

44
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:52,280
[SPEAKER_14]: So those are a couple of reasonable things that would help make sure that this project is successful and hopefully alleviate some of the concerns of the community as well.

45
00:05:56,832 --> 00:05:58,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Is any of that stuff typically commissioned?

46
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:00,813
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm conditioned by a commission.

47
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:12,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I know oftentimes when there's plantings involved, a lot of commissions require, you know, two growing seasons prior to the issuance of a certificate of compliance or something like that.

48
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:22,200
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I would defer to Heidi and Dennis and others as far as what is a typical condition for Medford.

49
00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:26,619
[SPEAKER_14]: we have it.

50
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:27,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Go ahead.

51
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

52
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:38,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we do condition, we can condition in order to include monitoring for success of the plantings.

53
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:50,585
[SPEAKER_12]: And we could also condition a requirement for an invasive species management plan prior to be submitted for review and approval prior to construction.

54
00:06:53,866 --> 00:06:54,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Heidi.

55
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:02,502
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I'm happy to put them in the O&M but maybe if they were in an order that got recorded and ran with the land it might be more appropriate or perhaps both.

56
00:07:03,902 --> 00:07:09,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah I think sometimes some items like that get lost in an O&M plan.

57
00:07:09,606 --> 00:07:12,367
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be glad to have it in both, make sure it happens.

58
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,470
[SPEAKER_12]: Eric and Carolyn?

59
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:20,754
[SPEAKER_05]: No, nothing further for me.

60
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:21,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I've reviewed the materials.

61
00:07:21,914 --> 00:07:25,235
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate the applicant's time in preparing this.

62
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:25,795
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

63
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:28,856
[SPEAKER_10]: Nothing for me either.

64
00:07:28,876 --> 00:07:30,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

65
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:30,916
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

66
00:07:32,496 --> 00:07:48,239
[SPEAKER_12]: Then I'll take, we can take more comments from the public as long as you can please raise your hand either with your actual physical hand or with the

67
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:53,905
[SPEAKER_12]: the button and state your name and your address for the record, please.

68
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,470
[SPEAKER_12]: I see that Ms.

69
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,870
[SPEAKER_12]: James has her hand up.

70
00:08:10,711 --> 00:08:13,132
[SPEAKER_12]: So you may have the floor.

71
00:08:15,357 --> 00:08:21,999
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm an abutter to the abutters.

72
00:08:22,519 --> 00:08:28,441
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm also filling in for the D'Angelo family who cannot be here today due to a loss of a family member.

73
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So they asked me to try to help with some suggestions.

74
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:36,684
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not an engineer, though John was, or is, I should say.

75
00:08:37,405 --> 00:08:41,026
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have, you know, they still have the concerns about

76
00:08:42,026 --> 00:08:52,711
[SPEAKER_07]: have this area changed and tampered with because of flooding and also privacy concerns to the abutters properties and I'm sure others will speak.

77
00:08:53,391 --> 00:09:00,814
[SPEAKER_07]: But looking through some of these things, I looked at the operation and maintenance plan and I had sent an email very late today.

78
00:09:00,834 --> 00:09:06,097
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm concerned that there's nothing about the post-development operation and maintenance

79
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:11,427
[SPEAKER_07]: after construction, like tree maintenance and tree replacement.

80
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:16,131
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's often seen in controls for

81
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:21,789
[SPEAKER_07]: as you had requested, a plan for maintenance.

82
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:37,278
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm concerned about that, and we're trying to protect the wetlands and the trees that are there, and also the new plantings that the owner has proposed for trees.

83
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:41,322
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I think that would be good to have that in there.

84
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:58,118
[SPEAKER_07]: In the first section, they mentioned, let me just get, because I have quite a few notes here, mud and sediment tracked on to public roads shall be immediately removed and excess water to another section.

85
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:05,026
[SPEAKER_07]: But none of that is mentioned that I saw in the after maintenance, after the work is completed.

86
00:10:05,106 --> 00:10:08,731
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was a big concern for the residents because mud does flow out.

87
00:10:09,171 --> 00:10:12,936
[SPEAKER_07]: And with all this new construction, I would think that

88
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:18,567
[SPEAKER_07]: since that was a major concern that if that still happens that they'd be monitoring that.

89
00:10:18,928 --> 00:10:23,510
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd like to propose that that is also included in the after maintenance plan.

90
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:34,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Then the safety was mentioned by several neighbors because this will be opened up where that's into this new area since there'll be parking which there never was before.

91
00:10:35,876 --> 00:10:38,997
[SPEAKER_07]: the safety concerns and preservation of the wetlands.

92
00:10:39,437 --> 00:10:42,838
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see anything of that in the after maintenance plan.

93
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:46,839
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm wondering, what are the plans to preserve it?

94
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:52,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there no trespassing signs that may be put up into that area after the parking?

95
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:58,761
[SPEAKER_07]: To preserve that area from trespass and damage.

96
00:11:01,554 --> 00:11:12,340
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing I wanted to bring out, and I refer to your expertise, and I really thank you for your expertise in reviewing this project, the chemicals for snow melt.

97
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:17,623
[SPEAKER_07]: This area will have snow plowing if there's snow over the parking area.

98
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:19,864
[SPEAKER_07]: That's never been done there before.

99
00:11:19,884 --> 00:11:30,570
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just questioning, do we really need to use chemicals that have never existed there, and how will they damage the existing wetlands plants and trees?

100
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:43,461
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure, you know, I understand they may plow and I'm just not sure that things won't be damaged and that the chemicals will leach out.

101
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:52,268
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing I wanted to clarify, I mentioned last, at the last meeting, the lighting that may be installed with this project is approved.

102
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,429
[SPEAKER_07]: And I mentioned our skylighting.

103
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:03,433
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there are a lot of animals there that travel through there, and maybe, you know, low lighting or no lighting is best, but we probably will put up lighting.

104
00:12:04,013 --> 00:12:22,720
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do have an ordinance, and this may be outside of the Conservation Commission, and it's chapter 94.6, and it says, any outdoor lighting of parking or loading areas shall be so arranged that no light source shall be visible from any point on surrounding properties.

105
00:12:23,947 --> 00:12:34,653
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wanted to make that clear, because we're talking about a proposed gem in a new parking area that abuts private property.

106
00:12:35,433 --> 00:12:42,697
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're trying to preserve the beauty of the area and privacy and property values, which I think is a reasonable request.

107
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:46,619
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the parking,

108
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:54,878
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I still have questions about where they got the numbers for the recorded parking, if that's needed at all, depending on the hours of operation.

109
00:12:54,898 --> 00:12:59,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not, I didn't get to read all the zoning for parking.

110
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:02,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure you probably reviewed that.

111
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:11,382
[SPEAKER_07]: But it seems as though, from what I read, that since the building department would be the one to approve this project and

112
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:23,153
[SPEAKER_07]: that depending on the hours of operation, parking spaces might be reduced depending on the capacity of the occupants at different times of the day.

113
00:13:24,014 --> 00:13:26,676
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm wondering, well, do we really need to have this parking?

114
00:13:28,698 --> 00:13:32,641
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I covered my concerns.

115
00:13:33,842 --> 00:13:35,784
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you for listening.

116
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:38,166
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ms.

117
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:38,466
[SPEAKER_12]: James.

118
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:41,529
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have Ms.

119
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:41,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Hilton.

120
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:55,874
[SPEAKER_12]: You're on mute.

121
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:57,415
[SPEAKER_12]: You're on mute, we can't hear you.

122
00:13:57,435 --> 00:14:01,298
[SPEAKER_14]: I think she's saying she's going to try to call in from her phone.

123
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:01,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I see.

124
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that what that means?

125
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,241
[SPEAKER_14]: No, she's unmuted.

126
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:06,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me now?

127
00:14:06,642 --> 00:14:07,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we can.

128
00:14:07,502 --> 00:14:08,563
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

129
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,065
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

130
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:13,607
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

131
00:14:14,227 --> 00:14:14,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you still hear me?

132
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:15,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

133
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:23,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I can't hear you guys if I use my laptop so I hung up on the phone to avoid the feedback.

134
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,205
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to talk as long as you guys can hear me.

135
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:27,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't hear you though.

136
00:14:28,187 --> 00:14:30,328
[SPEAKER_01]: So Rachel Hilton 25 Sherman place.

137
00:14:30,428 --> 00:14:31,969
[SPEAKER_01]: I am the owner of that house.

138
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:36,989
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did send an email over to Dennis.

139
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,732
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was yesterday, so I don't know if anyone's taken a look at that and this may not even.

140
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:49,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Be relevant for this particular meeting, and I was on last week's call, so I'm just getting up to speed.

141
00:14:49,834 --> 00:14:50,514
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize.

142
00:14:50,554 --> 00:14:52,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't on the earlier calls.

143
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:53,215
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also dealing with a.

144
00:14:53,955 --> 00:15:12,687
[SPEAKER_01]: Family member and elderly family member, so I wasn't able to join the initial calls, but I guess my biggest question is, and that was part of my email has the owner or owners thought about other properties that already have.

145
00:15:13,547 --> 00:15:14,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's say a gym.

146
00:15:15,974 --> 00:15:23,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Or parking already established, I know that there's a bunch of properties in Medford that are not being used.

147
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:28,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, there's a golds gym off of I think it's commercial street right around the corner.

148
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:35,640
[SPEAKER_01]: That went bankrupt and so it's a building, it's existing parking and already exists.

149
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:49,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I guess and again, I'm not sure if that's not part of this meeting, but that was a really big question of mine because again, there's lots of structures already in place that would not disturb a wetlands.

150
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:55,439
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I guess that's my biggest question has that has the owner even thought about maybe.

151
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:08,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Properties are already existing that already have parking already have buildings that could actually not affect an existing wetland where there's so many animals we've seen.

152
00:16:10,347 --> 00:16:16,390
[SPEAKER_01]: I've lived here for 10 years and I've seen so many animals and I've also dealt with the flooding.

153
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:21,912
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm two houses down from where the fence is and we get a lot of flooding.

154
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:35,438
[SPEAKER_01]: As everyone's already talked about, I know probably ad nauseum, but we have two storm drains down at the end, right in front of John D'Angelo's house and in front of Shirley Sullivan's house, and I'm right next to Shirley Sullivan.

155
00:16:36,155 --> 00:16:44,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a bear we have to, you know, they overflow and there's mud and it's disgusting and it's probably unsanitary.

156
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:56,006
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if that those waters go back into the wetlands, but we already have that huge issue where the water overflows right out of the storm drains.

157
00:16:56,126 --> 00:17:02,270
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess we've, I've heard that we've gone to the town multiple times and nothing's been done.

158
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:08,111
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just have to manage that as homeowners, which shouldn't really be the case.

159
00:17:09,271 --> 00:17:14,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, not sure if that's not part of this call, but I just wanted to raise a couple of just questions.

160
00:17:14,913 --> 00:17:19,515
[SPEAKER_01]: Have we looked at other properties that, again, are already in existence?

161
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:23,097
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure that's not an option at this point.

162
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:31,100
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure they've already purchased this property, but it just seems strange that we would want to disturb existing wetlands.

163
00:17:32,712 --> 00:17:35,534
[SPEAKER_01]: for a gym that could be pretty much, I think, put anywhere.

164
00:17:36,455 --> 00:17:38,016
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are my concerns.

165
00:17:38,116 --> 00:17:39,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So thanks for listening.

166
00:17:39,157 --> 00:17:41,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

167
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:53,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Salvo, would you like to respond at all?

168
00:17:54,263 --> 00:18:01,170
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess just a couple of points of clarification than anything else.

169
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,871
[SPEAKER_03]: We keep on referring to this as a wetland.

170
00:18:02,931 --> 00:18:03,732
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a wetland.

171
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:05,834
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an isolated land subject to flooding.

172
00:18:06,915 --> 00:18:15,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Its interests are relative to that of flood control, not the other features that bordering vegetated wetlands provide.

173
00:18:16,445 --> 00:18:26,895
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the other point is, as far as the lighting goes, we're not proposing any new lighting, the lighting that's there that that's currently at that site will remain at that site.

174
00:18:26,935 --> 00:18:28,877
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no proposed changes to it.

175
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,301
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think beyond that.

176
00:18:34,263 --> 00:18:38,284
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think we've proven that we've met all the performance standards.

177
00:18:38,324 --> 00:18:42,765
[SPEAKER_03]: There's performance standards for working in these resource areas.

178
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:51,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Matter of fact, I think we've exceeded the performance standards with the extra compensatory storage that we've proposed in an effort.

179
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:58,370
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, to try to make this situation better as much as we have control over without causing any damage.

180
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:14,836
[SPEAKER_03]: And beyond that, I think the addition of the landscaping will serve to add some meaningful habitat and probably most importantly, create more of a green screen to really start to screen this stuff from the abutting residential neighborhood.

181
00:19:15,236 --> 00:19:19,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, it is an area where a commercial area abuts a residential area and those

182
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:26,261
[SPEAKER_03]: interfaces can sometimes be tricky, but I think we've done the best that we can here.

183
00:19:26,481 --> 00:19:29,402
[SPEAKER_03]: So I guess with that, I'll turn it back to the commission.

184
00:19:31,343 --> 00:19:31,664
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

185
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:44,390
[SPEAKER_12]: And before the commission deliberates, I do want to remind everybody that of their appeal rights, the direct abutters may appeal a commission's decision as well as 10 concerned residents.

186
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:49,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, Ms.

187
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:50,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Loud.

188
00:19:52,512 --> 00:19:55,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I'm Linda Loud, 25 Sherman Court.

189
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:59,475
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had a question that came to mind.

190
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:05,337
[SPEAKER_08]: You have 14 or it's going to be 12 parking spaces or whatever it's going to be.

191
00:20:05,977 --> 00:20:13,180
[SPEAKER_08]: For a gym to be successful, would that mean that there's only 12 people there at a time in the gym?

192
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,482
[SPEAKER_08]: I see all these gyms in the morning, they're full of people.

193
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:20,028
[SPEAKER_08]: So where are these extra cars going to park?

194
00:20:22,331 --> 00:20:25,214
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be a total of 61 parking spaces on the site.

195
00:20:25,254 --> 00:20:26,856
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just adding 12 additional.

196
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I see.

197
00:20:28,998 --> 00:20:29,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

198
00:20:29,238 --> 00:20:30,620
[SPEAKER_08]: That was my misunderstanding.

199
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,401
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

200
00:20:34,128 --> 00:20:42,793
[SPEAKER_08]: I just wanted to state the fact that I've lived here for 47 years and we've had a lot of troubles over the years.

201
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:44,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, everybody has with the water.

202
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:49,036
[SPEAKER_08]: And when they put that building in, we had a whole abundance of water.

203
00:20:49,516 --> 00:20:52,438
[SPEAKER_08]: My neighbor's backyard is actually flooded right now.

204
00:20:53,080 --> 00:21:00,282
[SPEAKER_08]: and they abut the fence, I'm just concerned that this is gonna pose a bigger problem than what is expected.

205
00:21:01,002 --> 00:21:08,984
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for answering my question about the parking spaces, because I was beginning to say, how many people can 14 do over there?

206
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:18,506
[SPEAKER_08]: But I agree with Rachel that they should look to a place that is not going to bother a nice quiet neighborhood.

207
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:21,307
[SPEAKER_08]: And thank you for listening.

208
00:21:23,077 --> 00:21:23,757
[SPEAKER_12]: You're very welcome.

209
00:21:23,898 --> 00:21:24,818
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for your comments.

210
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,723
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I wanted to bring it back to the commission.

211
00:21:38,206 --> 00:21:38,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Ms.

212
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:47,352
[SPEAKER_12]: James did bring up one point that I wish we had talked about earlier, and that's snow disposal.

213
00:21:49,140 --> 00:22:06,289
[SPEAKER_12]: We do want to make sure that there is no once that snow is disposed of anywhere near the particle separator or into the isolated land subject to flooding, as the de-icing agents are certainly deleterious.

214
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:12,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Does the O&M plan designate a snow disposal area?

215
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:16,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking right now.

216
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:25,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in the pervious area directly adjacent to the parking lot, and then it gets removed beyond that.

217
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:31,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, because this is obviously being pervious pavement, you wouldn't want to dispose of snow on that.

218
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:39,646
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, as long as that's, we wanted to be assured of that.

219
00:22:39,966 --> 00:22:43,166
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would expect a condition similar to that.

220
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:45,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's pretty standard for most conservation commissions.

221
00:22:56,976 --> 00:23:05,742
[SPEAKER_12]: I do appreciate the species and the revisions to the plan.

222
00:23:06,562 --> 00:23:09,464
[SPEAKER_12]: Ilex glabra does have some wildlife habitat value.

223
00:23:09,984 --> 00:23:18,970
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently robins like the berries in particular, and we'll leave them in December when there's not much else.

224
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:23,513
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think it's an improvement over the last plan.

225
00:23:31,268 --> 00:23:39,152
[SPEAKER_12]: I do believe that the project does meet the performance standards for isolated land subject to flooding and has provided some buffer zone improvements.

226
00:23:40,693 --> 00:23:52,839
[SPEAKER_12]: But again, that's my opinion, but I'd like to, again, if the chair has, I mean, if the commission has any further comments or would like to discuss conditions, we should do so.

227
00:23:55,337 --> 00:23:55,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Heidi.

228
00:23:57,378 --> 00:24:22,354
[SPEAKER_14]: I do think it's important that we make sure that the community who have been very vocal about this project, and I very much appreciate their involvement and engagement here, that they understand that we very much hear your comments and appreciate them and have used them to inform our review of the project and the comments that we've provided and the

229
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:26,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Conditions that will be applied to this project.

230
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:37,330
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand very much how this feels like a change and any change can be unwelcome or difficult.

231
00:24:40,373 --> 00:25:05,570
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I, I think that through this process of reviewing this, um, I think it is worth clarifying again that, uh, while this will not solve the flooding issues that you all experience, which is really unfortunate, um, that we've, uh, asked and the proponent has agreed to, uh, not just meet the compensatory storage, but it has exceeded it.

232
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:09,073
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, uh, that will presumably have a net,

233
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:10,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Improvement.

234
00:25:12,216 --> 00:25:17,543
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been able to preserve some pretty significant canopy trees with their agreement.

235
00:25:17,703 --> 00:25:23,951
[SPEAKER_14]: I think when you look at the trees that are there, those two 36 inch trees and others near them are by far the.

236
00:25:24,892 --> 00:25:27,354
[SPEAKER_14]: most significant element of that tree canopy.

237
00:25:27,774 --> 00:25:31,477
[SPEAKER_14]: So that has impact for water uptake.

238
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:41,123
[SPEAKER_14]: It has considerations for habitat and for screening and for just the general appearance and quality of that space.

239
00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:47,127
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish that we could do more to address lighting and security and things like that.

240
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:55,413
[SPEAKER_14]: But as you noted, those are not part of this board's purview, but appreciate hearing from Rick that new lighting is not intended out here.

241
00:25:55,453 --> 00:25:57,775
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope that if there is a plan for new lighting that.

242
00:25:58,335 --> 00:26:07,517
[SPEAKER_14]: He will engage with this community in the way that he has so far and his clients have so far to do that thoughtfully.

243
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:14,318
[SPEAKER_14]: And then again, you've accommodated our comments on the replacement planting.

244
00:26:14,338 --> 00:26:19,679
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the avoidance of removing as many trees as possible.

245
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:21,800
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a net positive.

246
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:33,103
[SPEAKER_14]: along with the conditions that will apply for invasives management and establishing, making sure that the planting is established.

247
00:26:33,743 --> 00:26:42,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I really think that what we've come to here strikes an appropriate balance between the need for this parking for this business and this owner,

248
00:26:43,827 --> 00:26:45,809
[SPEAKER_14]: and addressing the concerns of the community.

249
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:53,875
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just appreciate all of the engagement around this and the opportunity to find a good outcome on the project.

250
00:26:53,915 --> 00:27:04,162
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope that the community, you know, continues their advocacy and sees that it has had a positive impact here as well.

251
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,823
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for all the engagement.

252
00:27:08,746 --> 00:27:09,266
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Jeremy.

253
00:27:16,723 --> 00:27:24,009
[SPEAKER_14]: If we are ready to discuss conditions, they're the couple that I brought up earlier.

254
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:28,452
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be happy to try to elaborate on some language for them.

255
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:30,834
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the first step there though, Heidi?

256
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:38,659
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have a late comment.

257
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:45,805
[SPEAKER_12]: If this project is approved, who can we as residents get assistance from in Medford to address the existing potential

258
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:51,114
[SPEAKER_12]: huge for additional flooding, which is a valid question.

259
00:27:52,215 --> 00:28:05,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I wanted to reiterate there is an opportunity to appeal any decision by the Conservation Commission, but regarding approaching the city, Dennis, do you have any suggestions?

260
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,371
[SPEAKER_04]: You're on mute, Dennis.

261
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:14,100
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, this little raucous in here, not raucous, just noisy.

262
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,360
[SPEAKER_04]: So I had to mute.

263
00:28:17,041 --> 00:28:30,164
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say in this instance, given that if it's directly related to like the work that's being done there, if you see something there, so I'm just gonna throw it in the chat anyway, but my email has been around before, but just email me if you see anything, you know,

264
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:37,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would probably be the best first step, because I'm the environmental agent for the city.

265
00:28:38,306 --> 00:28:46,748
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, there's other, once we sort of evaluate that, then there's other people in the city hall that I could talk to and see what is going on.

266
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:48,769
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think the initial step is not too great.

267
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:58,511
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's particularly important to note any surcharging of catch basins or street chains.

268
00:28:58,631 --> 00:29:00,832
[SPEAKER_12]: Surcharging means the water is coming up and out.

269
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,587
[SPEAKER_12]: So Jeremy, back to you.

270
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:13,871
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we can discuss draft language for conditions at this point.

271
00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:23,360
[SPEAKER_12]: You have a few, I have a few as well, and I'm sure Carolyn and Eric do as well, but why don't you start us off?

272
00:29:25,862 --> 00:29:27,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure, let me find my notes again.

273
00:29:30,664 --> 00:29:48,732
[SPEAKER_14]: The first would be a condition that all areas disturbed by construction activities, including excavation, construction access, and debris cleanup, and that are intended to be left unpaved,

274
00:29:50,252 --> 00:30:02,296
[SPEAKER_14]: and revegetated will be monitored post-construction to ensure complete establishment of and coverage by the specified native seed mix plant species.

275
00:30:03,637 --> 00:30:16,341
[SPEAKER_14]: Monitoring should continue for a minimum of a 12-month period, and any areas where the seed mix does not establish will be reprepared and reseeded with the same or similar mix.

276
00:30:19,196 --> 00:30:34,783
[SPEAKER_14]: confirmation of establishment via photos and or site visit by the commission or the commission's agent would be required prior to closeout of the notice of intent and order of conditions.

277
00:30:38,404 --> 00:30:48,909
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a great start, but may I suggest that because an order is, the life of an order is three years, I think we could require monitoring for three growing seasons.

278
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:52,598
[SPEAKER_14]: I would support that, absolutely.

279
00:30:55,581 --> 00:30:59,864
[SPEAKER_14]: The second is related to invasive plant management.

280
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:03,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to see that included in the O&M manual.

281
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:19,237
[SPEAKER_14]: So whoever's reviewing that manual and following it has that in front of them, but also as an order, or excuse me, as a condition should include a process for monitoring the presence of common invasive plant species in disturbed areas.

282
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:26,240
[SPEAKER_14]: the removal of observed invasive plants and prevention of further spread of invasive plants.

283
00:31:32,162 --> 00:31:47,187
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may, we can address that, I think, most efficiently through requesting that an invasive plant management strategy be submitted to the commission for review and approval prior to construction.

284
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:48,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Agreed.

285
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:50,288
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Heidi.

286
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,569
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate the guidance.

287
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:54,209
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.

288
00:31:57,851 --> 00:31:59,571
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a few others I'd like to add.

289
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:13,376
[SPEAKER_12]: We observed a lot of debris by the particle separator at our site visit, and I request that debris be removed as a condition of this order.

290
00:32:15,377 --> 00:32:19,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you think the proponent is amenable to that, Mr. Silva?

291
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:21,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

292
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:25,675
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

293
00:32:30,197 --> 00:32:31,138
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't raise my hand.

294
00:32:31,178 --> 00:32:32,238
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to say something.

295
00:32:32,298 --> 00:32:34,679
[SPEAKER_00]: This is John Sullivan at 24 Sherman Place.

296
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:44,244
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that, you know, I've heard some semantics about not calling this a wetland, but, you know,

297
00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:57,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if this company that owns this building now actually owned it when they added on that huge addition that actually really did destroy what was a wetland over here.

298
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:00,496
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a pond over here that was enormous.

299
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:04,638
[SPEAKER_00]: It stretched all the way to where the houses are, all the way down on Gibson.

300
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:09,576
[SPEAKER_00]: This thing holds a tremendous amount of water, without a doubt.

301
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:13,297
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's basically when all the flooding really started here.

302
00:33:13,317 --> 00:33:15,938
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're just going to continue down this vein.

303
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:19,458
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that this is going to happen pretty much anyway.

304
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:28,721
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is basically the final nail in the coffin for this entire area that was a very nice little wetland area.

305
00:33:29,261 --> 00:33:34,883
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it did, it became like a muddy puddle in the summer, but there was enormous amounts of water there.

306
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:40,545
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the kids, we, as kids, we used to be up to, we can go up to our shoulders in the deepest part of that.

307
00:33:41,046 --> 00:33:43,347
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, all that stuff's been filled in.

308
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:51,850
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you don't have to call it a wetland anymore if you don't want to, but it isn't because of whoever did that and whoever approved those types of projects.

309
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,731
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to help.

310
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:56,294
[SPEAKER_00]: This is only going to exacerbate these problems.

311
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:05,101
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless there's an actual real plan to actually make sure that that does not happen, then that is a problem.

312
00:34:05,261 --> 00:34:09,305
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is something that nobody really wants to say.

313
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:17,492
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry that I have to say it like that, but I just think that, you know, like, oh, well, you know, it's not going to help it.

314
00:34:18,513 --> 00:34:21,515
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, that's almost like saying it's it's basically going to hurt it.

315
00:34:21,736 --> 00:34:22,736
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to make it worse.

316
00:34:23,157 --> 00:34:27,540
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you say you've got all these plans and now you're going to pull out all this vegetation.

317
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:31,042
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't see how that's going to help at all.

318
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,864
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter how you recede it.

319
00:34:33,144 --> 00:34:36,847
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd almost rather you put poison ivy there so that way people won't cut through.

320
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:40,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so, you know, do whatever you like.

321
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:45,716
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to happen anyway, but this problem started years and years ago.

322
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:51,623
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I don't know who built it, but it may have been the people who own it now.

323
00:34:51,683 --> 00:34:54,306
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is when the problem really started.

324
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:55,607
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

325
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Mr. Sullivan.

326
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:12,697
[SPEAKER_12]: I also wanted to note that there should be no snow disposal within the area of pervious pavement.

327
00:35:17,401 --> 00:35:28,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Heidi, can we include in that that there should be no snow disposal within the vegetated areas or the resource area?

328
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,110
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

329
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:41,719
[SPEAKER_10]: We have another hand raised, I'll let you address that or not.

330
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:48,562
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we did have, yes, Ms.

331
00:35:48,582 --> 00:36:00,809
[SPEAKER_12]: James, one more comment, but we did close the public comment period, so the commission is in their deliberations, but if you could be, I will allow this one last comment.

332
00:36:02,423 --> 00:36:13,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I hope with the after maintenance plan, addressing the mud that flows out from this project after maintenance.

333
00:36:14,051 --> 00:36:23,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that you consider that and also the tree maintenance after replacement and during, I mean, sorry, after the construction is done.

334
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:23,698
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

335
00:36:25,921 --> 00:36:34,147
[SPEAKER_12]: I did we did address the establishment of the vegetation through the requirement for monitoring for 3 growing seasons.

336
00:36:34,828 --> 00:36:36,709
[SPEAKER_12]: So that will be part of the order regarding.

337
00:36:36,729 --> 00:36:43,595
[SPEAKER_12]: I, I'm not sure we can condition something about mud as we can't.

338
00:36:44,795 --> 00:36:47,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Directly say it's an existing condition, isn't it?

339
00:36:50,137 --> 00:36:55,483
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not sure that we can then say that this project is causing the mud when it's already an existing.

340
00:36:56,664 --> 00:37:02,330
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to look at the proposed project, not what's currently on the ground.

341
00:37:03,991 --> 00:37:05,393
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure we can condition.

342
00:37:05,413 --> 00:37:10,258
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure that's within our abilities to do so.

343
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:11,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

344
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:25,300
[SPEAKER_07]: My understanding is that the mud, when it rains heavily, that the water and mud does flow out from that wetland buffer zone and into the streets and to the neighbor's properties.

345
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:29,064
[SPEAKER_12]: That's definitely part of the larger issue of flooding here.

346
00:37:29,384 --> 00:37:32,567
[SPEAKER_12]: And it seems like something that the city of Medford

347
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:35,844
[SPEAKER_12]: property owner to clean the mud from the street.

348
00:37:36,845 --> 00:37:37,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

349
00:38:00,693 --> 00:38:08,136
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, for this, what we're talking about, the flow from the wetlands into the streets.

350
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:14,979
[SPEAKER_07]: They did mention it in their maintenance plan that they would clean it up during the construction period.

351
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:25,524
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm like, okay, what about after it's all done, if it gets worse or it's still there, who's in charge of, it is their private property.

352
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,946
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and it's a wetland, so we're just,

353
00:38:32,263 --> 00:38:35,566
[SPEAKER_12]: but it's sure in place is a public way.

354
00:38:35,586 --> 00:38:37,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

355
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:54,042
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, I don't see how we can require a private property owner to provide anything beyond the construction O&M of the area.

356
00:38:54,802 --> 00:38:56,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

357
00:38:56,163 --> 00:38:58,586
[SPEAKER_12]: But I appreciate your comments and thank you.

358
00:38:58,986 --> 00:38:59,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for explaining.

359
00:39:02,287 --> 00:39:05,288
[SPEAKER_00]: the end of the street, the street sweeping could never address that problem.

360
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:10,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

361
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:18,670
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll make a motion to close the public hearing portion of this and turn to deliberation where we won't accept any new information at this point.

362
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:21,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Do I have a second?

363
00:39:24,151 --> 00:39:24,732
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll second that.

364
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,392
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor, Caroline?

365
00:39:29,153 --> 00:39:29,273
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

366
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:30,453
[SPEAKER_12]: Eric?

367
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:31,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

368
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:36,723
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeremy and myself, isn't I?

369
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:38,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Caroline.

370
00:39:42,985 --> 00:39:46,586
[SPEAKER_10]: And I have a few conditions that I can offer up.

371
00:39:47,186 --> 00:39:56,708
[SPEAKER_10]: For the tree planting, I was thinking of conditioning that trees, the 15 trees be a minimum of two inch caliber.

372
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:01,250
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't see, I don't think I saw a size on the plan.

373
00:40:08,413 --> 00:40:14,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, that the trees be irrigated for 3 growing seasons.

374
00:40:16,036 --> 00:40:18,837
[SPEAKER_10]: From May to October and also that.

375
00:40:20,758 --> 00:40:23,458
[SPEAKER_10]: They be irrigated with 20 gallons of water per week.

376
00:40:25,379 --> 00:40:29,981
[SPEAKER_10]: During between May and October and then.

377
00:40:32,265 --> 00:40:38,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Finally, that any trees that do not survive those 3 growing seasons are replaced in kind.

378
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:45,150
[SPEAKER_10]: That was the proposed for the tree topic.

379
00:40:49,452 --> 00:40:50,513
[SPEAKER_12]: For 3 growing seasons.

380
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:54,935
[SPEAKER_10]: 2 and 3 happy to discuss that further.

381
00:40:54,955 --> 00:40:55,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

382
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:10,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Is Dennis have we conditioned any order for something similar before in your memory?

383
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:18,594
[SPEAKER_04]: No irrigation conditions in my, you know, since I've been here and since when I was on the commission before, so.

384
00:41:19,334 --> 00:41:25,418
[SPEAKER_12]: So Caroline, are you thinking of actual like piping or the plastic landscaping?

385
00:41:27,299 --> 00:41:28,240
[SPEAKER_12]: Temporary or?

386
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:30,571
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, Jeremy.

387
00:41:30,591 --> 00:41:39,955
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to say, it could be described as watering, whether that's system or hand watering or tree bags or something.

388
00:41:43,196 --> 00:41:47,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I did something to ensure that these trees succeed.

389
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:51,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that doesn't the three growing seasons do that, though.

390
00:41:54,493 --> 00:41:55,894
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the intent of the 3.3.

391
00:41:56,475 --> 00:41:57,776
[SPEAKER_03]: If they don't want them, they're not going to survive.

392
00:41:57,796 --> 00:41:58,597
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have to.

393
00:41:58,617 --> 00:42:01,879
[SPEAKER_03]: They got to replant them, right?

394
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're fine with it either way, but no good point.

395
00:42:07,804 --> 00:42:09,766
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess if we just wanted to.

396
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:15,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Limited that the trees, any tree that doesn't survive 3 growing seasons must be replaced.

397
00:42:17,152 --> 00:42:19,895
[SPEAKER_10]: And leave it up to the applicant of how to get to that success.

398
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

399
00:42:21,321 --> 00:42:23,503
[SPEAKER_03]: And this will all come out during the certificate of compliance.

400
00:42:24,144 --> 00:42:26,987
[SPEAKER_03]: The commission will know that all the trees survived.

401
00:42:27,007 --> 00:42:35,095
[SPEAKER_12]: And of course, if we have another drought season, it would be in the applicant's best interest to water them in right after.

402
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:35,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

403
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:44,892
[SPEAKER_10]: The other condition, I know it's in the O&M plan about keeping maintenance logs.

404
00:42:45,872 --> 00:42:48,173
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it'd be a good idea to just incorporate that.

405
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:51,774
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that was in the original order of conditions and certificate of compliance.

406
00:42:53,034 --> 00:43:02,517
[SPEAKER_10]: But I'd be happy to see that requirement in there, just given that no maintenance had been occurring prior to this meeting.

407
00:43:04,937 --> 00:43:06,558
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm sorry, how would you phrase that again?

408
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:23,329
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm happy with what, so the O&M plan currently says all post-construction maintenance activities shall be documented and kept on file and made available to the city earlier on request.

409
00:43:28,253 --> 00:43:28,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds good.

410
00:43:31,953 --> 00:43:49,685
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the last one I had was that the applicant complies with the soil management plan prepared by an LSP, which I know they, I believe they are planning to do anyway, but just for the soil disturbance.

411
00:43:54,789 --> 00:43:55,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, we're fine with that.

412
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:56,690
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to do that anyway, so.

413
00:44:00,113 --> 00:44:00,373
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

414
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:04,766
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further discussion?

415
00:44:05,546 --> 00:44:06,186
[SPEAKER_12]: Anything further?

416
00:44:08,027 --> 00:44:09,427
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing further from me, thank you.

417
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:11,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeremy?

418
00:44:13,608 --> 00:44:14,368
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm good, thank you.

419
00:44:15,848 --> 00:44:16,529
[SPEAKER_12]: Do I have a motion?

420
00:44:33,591 --> 00:44:44,496
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll make such a motion to approve the application with the conditions that we've applied this evening and the typical conditions.

421
00:44:48,097 --> 00:44:48,657
[SPEAKER_10]: Second that.

422
00:44:51,918 --> 00:44:53,219
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor, Jeremy?

423
00:44:53,239 --> 00:44:53,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

424
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:55,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Caroline?

425
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:56,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

426
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:09,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, thank you all to the public for attending all of these hearings.

427
00:45:10,096 --> 00:45:11,437
[SPEAKER_12]: We do appreciate your input.

428
00:45:13,698 --> 00:45:20,663
[SPEAKER_12]: And Dennis, you can speak to when Mr. Saville can pick up the order.

429
00:45:23,048 --> 00:45:28,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably in the next week or so, given, I mean, I'm not sure, you know, so I have a zoning meetings tomorrow.

430
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:31,831
[SPEAKER_04]: So, tomorrow is going to be mostly a zoning day and then I'm not sure.

431
00:45:32,352 --> 00:45:35,673
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I won't probably can get started on it until probably honestly Monday at the earliest.

432
00:45:36,133 --> 00:45:40,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Given 2 other items in the agenda, so they're making multiple decisions coming my way.

433
00:45:40,475 --> 00:45:45,557
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will let, you know, and then, you know, when the decision is up, it'll.

434
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:51,561
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll go up on the same Google Drive page that all the other files have been put on.

435
00:45:51,581 --> 00:45:54,543
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll go up on there that day, and you'll be able to see it and read it.

436
00:45:54,763 --> 00:45:59,186
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll send the original to you, Rick, and let you know when it is.

437
00:46:00,227 --> 00:46:00,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

438
00:46:00,427 --> 00:46:03,330
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate everyone's time and input.

439
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,231
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this was a good process.

440
00:46:05,271 --> 00:46:07,893
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for everyone's expertise and input.

441
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:11,515
[SPEAKER_12]: You're very welcome.

442
00:46:11,996 --> 00:46:12,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Good night.

443
00:46:13,117 --> 00:46:13,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

444
00:46:22,242 --> 00:46:22,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Next up, Dennis.

445
00:46:24,464 --> 00:46:30,107
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up, we have the notice of intent for the Mr. River Road improvements.

446
00:46:39,653 --> 00:46:45,417
[SPEAKER_12]: We received a revised narrative, I believe, and revised plans.

447
00:46:45,597 --> 00:46:46,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that true?

448
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:47,859
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

449
00:46:53,262 --> 00:46:56,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure if Owen's available right now.

450
00:46:58,103 --> 00:46:58,423
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here.

451
00:46:58,483 --> 00:46:58,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

452
00:46:58,984 --> 00:46:59,324
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

453
00:46:59,544 --> 00:47:02,024
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't sure if maybe you could call to wait for a minute.

454
00:47:02,044 --> 00:47:11,627
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I wasn't going to make any, I mean, I feel like we know what was the added information provides.

455
00:47:11,807 --> 00:47:15,848
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I guess if you, I'm here for any questions at all.

456
00:47:17,954 --> 00:47:23,057
[SPEAKER_12]: We received it too late last week for the commission members to have reviewed it.

457
00:47:23,718 --> 00:47:26,960
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what brings us back here again tonight.

458
00:47:27,301 --> 00:47:28,601
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no worries.

459
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:31,844
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that you guys made a special hearing for this.

460
00:47:32,825 --> 00:47:33,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Completely understand.

461
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,672
[SPEAKER_12]: So I open it up for discussion to the commission.

462
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:02,920
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I've reviewed the updated plans.

463
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:07,923
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do have a couple of questions for you, Owen.

464
00:48:08,163 --> 00:48:09,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me just open my file here.

465
00:48:14,247 --> 00:48:15,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Bear with me for a second.

466
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:43,178
Sorry.

467
00:48:52,947 --> 00:48:57,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Dennis, am I able to share my screen?

468
00:48:58,852 --> 00:48:59,072
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

469
00:49:04,256 --> 00:49:04,837
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, thanks.

470
00:49:08,065 --> 00:49:30,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, Owen, like I said last week, I appreciate the modifications to the French drain along the sidewalk and the sort of cutouts that have been added to avoid excavation in close proximity to the trees out here.

471
00:49:32,241 --> 00:49:34,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Looking through the plans, the updated sheets, I did

472
00:49:36,135 --> 00:49:45,065
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a number of trees on this east side of the project that, from what I can tell, are not showing tree protection.

473
00:49:45,125 --> 00:49:51,772
[SPEAKER_14]: They're beyond the straw waddle, but they are, or the hay bale or whatever is proposed, they are

474
00:49:53,322 --> 00:49:59,845
[SPEAKER_14]: very close to the limit of grading, and several of them are pretty significant size, these couple down here.

475
00:50:01,266 --> 00:50:05,087
[SPEAKER_14]: You've addressed the 36 and 32-inch caliper tree.

476
00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:18,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Was there a reason that no cutouts were made at these other trees here or that no tree protection is indicated for those trees?

477
00:50:19,754 --> 00:50:22,175
[SPEAKER_06]: I would assume just because they're outside the limit of work.

478
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:27,997
[SPEAKER_14]: And is the intent to grade up to the dashed line here?

479
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:32,979
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe the grading was limited.

480
00:50:32,999 --> 00:50:37,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe that there's that much grading over these root zones.

481
00:50:38,761 --> 00:50:50,266
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can also condition that the grading is minimal over the root zone area if that's something that is needed.

482
00:50:53,470 --> 00:51:03,095
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, if it's minimal and it's not going to be big excavators swinging a bucket around or something near these trees, then I understand not putting true protection around them.

483
00:51:03,135 --> 00:51:14,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I think if there is going to be equipment in this area, I'd like to see the sort of reinforcement around the trunk itself added to those trees.

484
00:51:15,481 --> 00:51:15,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Understood.

485
00:51:18,907 --> 00:51:21,789
[SPEAKER_14]: And then let's see the other comments I had here.

486
00:51:21,809 --> 00:51:25,492
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was just about grading.

487
00:51:27,654 --> 00:51:33,899
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to think about language of a condition related to grading around the tree trunks.

488
00:51:33,939 --> 00:51:41,025
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you mentioned last hearing that you reviewed this with Aggie Tudin, the tree warden.

489
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:43,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

490
00:51:43,081 --> 00:51:51,447
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about a tenth of an inch, like an inch, a tenth of a foot of grading change here.

491
00:51:51,487 --> 00:51:53,269
[SPEAKER_06]: That's good to hear.

492
00:51:53,709 --> 00:51:53,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

493
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,952
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just hard to tell without spot grades along that.

494
00:51:58,513 --> 00:51:58,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Understood.

495
00:51:58,953 --> 00:52:00,014
[SPEAKER_14]: I get it.

496
00:52:01,155 --> 00:52:07,200
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, if it's minimal, I think we can address any further concern about the grading there with the conditions.

497
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:08,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

498
00:52:09,041 --> 00:52:10,823
[SPEAKER_14]: That addresses my questions.

499
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:11,283
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

500
00:52:15,004 --> 00:52:15,884
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, thank you, Jeremy.

501
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:28,811
[SPEAKER_12]: No further comments or questions upon review of the revised information?

502
00:52:34,554 --> 00:52:36,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Nothing further from me either.

503
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:36,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

504
00:52:39,436 --> 00:52:40,417
[SPEAKER_10]: All set for me.

505
00:52:42,098 --> 00:52:42,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.

506
00:52:45,459 --> 00:52:46,643
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you all know where this is going.

507
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Do I have a motion?

508
00:52:47,968 --> 00:52:48,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

509
00:52:49,473 --> 00:52:50,677
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to add one more thing.

510
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I just got some information today.

511
00:52:55,244 --> 00:52:57,585
[SPEAKER_06]: I was sharing it with David or Dennis.

512
00:52:57,685 --> 00:53:07,030
[SPEAKER_06]: I was, I got some updated FEMA maps today and the compensatory storage area that we're.

513
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:12,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Kind of filling in is not going to be part of the FEMA firm maps.

514
00:53:13,933 --> 00:53:14,734
[SPEAKER_06]: After.

515
00:53:18,471 --> 00:53:39,738
[SPEAKER_06]: by eighth, so, because we're not, you know, we haven't had it, but I just wanted to give you, if you had any, like, you know, odd feelings about the compensatory storage, it's, FEMA's not calculating that area anymore as floodplain.

516
00:53:40,539 --> 00:53:44,400
[SPEAKER_05]: Are those preliminary maps that have been issued?

517
00:53:46,844 --> 00:53:52,029
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're losing Owen, but I could share them with you guys.

518
00:53:57,915 --> 00:54:03,460
[SPEAKER_06]: I shared the link with you that will show the new FEMA maps.

519
00:54:07,804 --> 00:54:09,826
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize, my internet connection is,

520
00:54:11,772 --> 00:54:17,042
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going through a VPN back so I access the city.

521
00:54:20,488 --> 00:54:23,433
[SPEAKER_06]: You know servers, so sometimes there's a lag.

522
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:38,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're going above and beyond what will be required of this project.

523
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:12,493
[SPEAKER_04]: And interestingly enough, the this is more just the route 28 underpass thing we did now that whole area is now not going to be included as well.

524
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:15,074
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the purple areas that's being removed as well.

525
00:55:15,914 --> 00:55:16,174
[SPEAKER_13]: Really?

526
00:55:16,394 --> 00:55:16,634
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

527
00:55:16,755 --> 00:55:16,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

528
00:55:17,395 --> 00:55:17,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

529
00:55:19,238 --> 00:55:24,823
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there's, we're going to have to kind of reconfigure some of what we think in the city is, but then other places have been added.

530
00:55:25,103 --> 00:55:28,186
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's, you know, it's, it's going to be sort of intriguing.

531
00:55:28,687 --> 00:55:33,631
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I remember when this happened, I think it was just after I started here about 10 years ago when we got the new plans.

532
00:55:34,112 --> 00:55:37,715
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a lot of and a lot of houses got added at that point and a lot of people were coming in.

533
00:55:38,616 --> 00:55:45,282
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, basically asking why is this happening and trying to go over it and I'm going to some of the public meetings and it was interesting, but it was also.

534
00:55:46,701 --> 00:56:13,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and actually, it might be interesting if we want to do a little side note on this is how best to maybe inform owners of households that were in the floodplain and are no longer in the floodplain, how to notify them that they should probably update their insurance policies to, you know, get, you know, not be paying for those type of fees.

535
00:56:14,936 --> 00:56:17,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I think it would just be something cool that the city could do.

536
00:56:17,618 --> 00:56:29,967
[SPEAKER_04]: I can mention I don't want to be like, an outreach for planning sort of just sort of get, you know, we have the software, we can figure out the addresses of those properties and then just sort of send them a letter saying, this is coming.

537
00:56:29,987 --> 00:56:32,609
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, was July 1st, I think.

538
00:56:33,552 --> 00:56:34,072
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.

539
00:56:34,312 --> 00:56:34,672
[SPEAKER_04]: July 8th.

540
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:43,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I still have to go in front of City Council and update the flood ordinance, but that's coming.

541
00:56:43,454 --> 00:56:47,215
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see that being a big issue in front of City Council.

542
00:57:03,163 --> 00:57:05,944
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, he's asking about my order.

543
00:57:05,984 --> 00:57:07,705
[SPEAKER_04]: He's asking about my, the 1 that we just did.

544
00:57:08,245 --> 00:57:10,065
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say no, because that's.

545
00:57:11,026 --> 00:57:13,327
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was only 1 slight portion of it.

546
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:14,887
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many other resource areas there.

547
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:19,829
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was only just, but like, this 1, it was literally, it was riverfront.

548
00:57:20,669 --> 00:57:24,351
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, land subject to flooding.

549
00:57:24,731 --> 00:57:31,193
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if the land subject to flooding was removed, it would just be riverfront, which has a lot less lower threshold of what's allowed and what's not allowed.

550
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:32,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

551
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:42,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe is that the way I sort of always sort of read it is that if it's just riverfront area, you know, like a pathway is much more straightforward.

552
00:57:43,573 --> 00:57:54,100
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know we've had that in the past with things, you know, like, like Riverbend Park, the pathway that went in, we just had to meet, you know, the minimum performance standards because it was just a riverfront area, no other resource area, but

553
00:57:57,438 --> 00:58:00,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, does that mean you are the city's floodplain manager?

554
00:58:00,619 --> 00:58:03,400
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe I am as designated by the ordinance.

555
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:03,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

556
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:09,222
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very interesting.

557
00:58:09,822 --> 00:58:15,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy to have other conversations regarding this at a future time.

558
00:58:17,845 --> 00:58:18,405
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, same.

559
00:58:19,632 --> 00:58:22,655
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm still just trying to figure out what the different colors on the Mac.

560
00:58:22,835 --> 00:58:27,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, so if you.

561
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:34,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually had a tutorial this morning on it, so it is thing if you go to the layer list and you if you check the 1st box.

562
00:58:36,289 --> 00:58:36,529
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um.

563
00:58:39,836 --> 00:58:59,459
[SPEAKER_06]: the uncheck the second and third and fifth box you're gonna see two colors basically a purple and a yellow the yellow is added floodplain storage the purple is no longer floodplain storage so in the

564
00:59:00,739 --> 00:59:04,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Case of mystic river road, which is right adjacent to this.

565
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:09,562
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got probably a dozen houses that are in that area that.

566
00:59:10,722 --> 00:59:15,304
[SPEAKER_06]: In the purple, no longer correct are no longer designated as that.

567
00:59:15,444 --> 00:59:19,546
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm sure that we all know that insurance companies would never.

568
00:59:20,406 --> 00:59:23,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Let that information out if.

569
00:59:24,847 --> 00:59:29,229
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not beneficial to them, so I feel like we should be proactive.

570
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:44,697
[SPEAKER_05]: I do wonder, however, purely as an aside, a personal contemplation here, if it is then more difficult if the floodplain is revised again for these homes to reobtain flood coverage.

571
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:49,200
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there some benefit to just maintaining it?

572
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:50,121
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, you're right.

573
00:59:50,181 --> 00:59:51,382
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's a good thing to look at.

574
00:59:51,402 --> 00:59:57,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I haven't... This would be... Before I would do outreach, I'd probably have to run this by KP Law and see what, you know, the...

575
01:00:00,073 --> 01:00:06,859
[SPEAKER_06]: The liability is, but this is public information or will be public information by summertime.

576
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:07,380
[SPEAKER_06]: So.

577
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

578
01:00:10,463 --> 01:00:17,870
[SPEAKER_05]: My experience elsewhere, the map updates have primarily been driven by.

579
01:00:19,084 --> 01:00:21,865
[SPEAKER_05]: better LIDAR data for Topo?

580
01:00:22,025 --> 01:00:23,426
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the case here too.

581
01:00:23,706 --> 01:00:25,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

582
01:00:25,567 --> 01:00:27,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just actually talking to Dennis about that earlier.

583
01:00:27,988 --> 01:00:30,629
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, I think it's just better contour data.

584
01:00:35,911 --> 01:00:36,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Very interesting.

585
01:00:36,732 --> 01:00:37,692
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for pointing that out.

586
01:00:37,712 --> 01:00:38,252
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it.

587
01:00:38,793 --> 01:00:38,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

588
01:00:40,413 --> 01:00:43,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, not an expert on this.

589
01:00:45,568 --> 01:01:00,934
[SPEAKER_06]: what we're looking at at the moment with the, if you're looking at the same link that I am, but I can always get that information from our contact over at DCR of how this was, how the data was driven.

590
01:01:00,954 --> 01:01:07,097
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sorry, what layer do you look at again?

591
01:01:07,717 --> 01:01:08,898
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm late to the party.

592
01:01:10,397 --> 01:01:10,797
[SPEAKER_06]: That's fine.

593
01:01:11,198 --> 01:01:19,625
[SPEAKER_06]: Check the first box, uncheck the next two, and then uncheck the National Flood Hazard Layer, which is kind of like the old layer.

594
01:01:19,645 --> 01:01:21,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Has it all.

595
01:01:22,287 --> 01:01:24,489
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll see yellow and purple.

596
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:25,570
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty.

597
01:01:26,111 --> 01:01:28,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Where are the boxes that you're checking?

598
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:34,424
[SPEAKER_12]: I might be in the wrong layer, but I don't see the box.

599
01:01:34,784 --> 01:01:37,267
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, nevermind.

600
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:39,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go on back to the hand.

601
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:41,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, sidetrack.

602
01:01:42,934 --> 01:01:44,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Blood map nerds here.

603
01:01:44,996 --> 01:01:47,599
[SPEAKER_14]: It is fascinating.

604
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:56,236
[SPEAKER_14]: So Heidi, are we looking to deliberate on any conditions to be added?

605
01:01:56,876 --> 01:02:04,058
[SPEAKER_04]: I think also just to be, you know, a pedant, we should open it up for public comment, even though, you know, given that there are.

606
01:02:04,298 --> 01:02:05,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for the reminder.

607
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:10,860
[SPEAKER_12]: If there's anybody from the public who would like to comment or ask questions, they may do so now.

608
01:02:18,052 --> 01:02:22,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Hearing none, then we can return to deliberation about conditions.

609
01:02:28,579 --> 01:02:42,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the 1 condition that I'd like to throw out there is that as the grading work and excavation work proceeds that the city tree warden be engaged if any.

610
01:02:43,585 --> 01:03:09,253
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, significant grading around the existing trees is anticipated, um, or if through that work, significant tree roots are encountered, um, and that they be consulted, uh, for an on-site review and advise, you know, to provide any advice or direction as far as changes to the extent of grading or trenching.

611
01:03:19,061 --> 01:03:20,402
[SPEAKER_04]: have a motion to adjourn.

612
01:03:47,352 --> 01:04:03,196
[SPEAKER_10]: I make a motion to approve the order of conditions for Mystic Road improvement file 215-0239 with our standard conditions and one special condition as discussed.

613
01:04:05,657 --> 01:04:10,158
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor, Caroline?

614
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:10,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

615
01:04:11,939 --> 01:04:12,239
[SPEAKER_12]: Eric?

616
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:13,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

617
01:04:14,206 --> 01:04:20,472
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeremy, and myself as an I. Thank you, everyone.

618
01:04:21,193 --> 01:04:22,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Very much appreciated.

619
01:04:22,995 --> 01:04:23,775
[SPEAKER_06]: You're very welcome.

620
01:04:23,915 --> 01:04:24,997
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for working with us.

621
01:04:25,017 --> 01:04:25,357
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

622
01:04:26,078 --> 01:04:32,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Bye.

623
01:04:34,085 --> 01:04:35,407
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, last but not least.

624
01:04:39,698 --> 01:04:41,319
[SPEAKER_04]: notice of intent for 53 went for delay.

625
01:04:41,699 --> 01:04:44,961
[SPEAKER_04]: I was convened from the last meeting and we have Mr. Marchanda here.

626
01:04:46,022 --> 01:04:46,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

627
01:04:48,703 --> 01:04:49,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for returning.

628
01:04:52,786 --> 01:04:55,968
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that the commission has had a chance to speak.

629
01:04:56,048 --> 01:04:56,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Eric, I'm sorry.

630
01:05:09,654 --> 01:05:09,894
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry?

631
01:05:09,914 --> 01:05:14,197
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kind of breaking up on my end.

632
01:05:14,217 --> 01:05:14,717
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.

633
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,202
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, Adam, it seems like your connection is lagging.

634
01:05:22,222 --> 01:05:28,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?

635
01:05:28,886 --> 01:05:30,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell I'm going slower.

636
01:05:30,347 --> 01:05:31,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me now or not?

637
01:05:37,617 --> 01:05:41,219
[SPEAKER_10]: You might want to maybe shut your video off.

638
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe that will help.

639
01:05:51,725 --> 01:05:52,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me any better now?

640
01:05:55,927 --> 01:05:56,768
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear me better now?

641
01:05:57,908 --> 01:05:58,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can.

642
01:05:59,589 --> 01:06:00,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.

643
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:00,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry about that.

644
01:06:05,622 --> 01:06:11,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, Eric, several of us were on the site last night, last night, I'm sorry, yesterday morning.

645
01:06:14,365 --> 01:06:25,149
[SPEAKER_12]: It was, it was a very clear drop off towards the wetlands.

646
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:29,290
[SPEAKER_12]: The wetland line was, I felt was well represented.

647
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:31,111
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't have any issues with it.

648
01:06:42,473 --> 01:06:45,254
[SPEAKER_12]: Anybody else want to offer their observations?

649
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:51,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.

650
01:06:51,955 --> 01:06:54,436
[SPEAKER_14]: It was very helpful to see in person.

651
01:06:56,236 --> 01:07:08,238
[SPEAKER_14]: And I found that the area within the wetland appears to have been used and maintained sort of in a domestic way.

652
01:07:11,882 --> 01:07:36,293
[SPEAKER_14]: and not being a wetland delineation expert by any means, but I wonder if the commissioners would be open to considering, and if it's of interest to Adam, reverting back to a graded slope

653
01:07:37,654 --> 01:07:47,342
[SPEAKER_14]: if ultimately that would result in less disturbance and impact than the proposed retaining wall.

654
01:07:51,205 --> 01:08:00,833
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that the suggestion for the retaining wall made a lot of sense when we were just looking at the plans, but having seen it in person, I could see that a,

655
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:08,534
[SPEAKER_14]: A slope would not deter wildlife in the way that a wall may.

656
01:08:09,354 --> 01:08:15,200
[SPEAKER_14]: It would not require as much excavation for footings and things like that.

657
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:28,131
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that either way, I think that we can address the wetland there, but just wanted to throw that out there for consideration.

658
01:08:30,571 --> 01:08:42,600
[SPEAKER_12]: So Mr. Marchando can speak to his clients, but there may be a desire to have a more level area.

659
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:47,343
[SPEAKER_12]: And so a retaining wall would help, of course, in providing more level yard space.

660
01:08:48,284 --> 01:08:54,908
[SPEAKER_12]: But I also agree with you that it would be less impactful to not have to excavate for footing, et cetera.

661
01:08:55,068 --> 01:08:58,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. Marchando, what's your thoughts?

662
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:04,021
[SPEAKER_02]: I, it doesn't really matter to me.

663
01:09:04,041 --> 01:09:10,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I know that the client originally wanted the three to one slope up how I originally proposed it.

664
01:09:11,746 --> 01:09:18,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but then obviously we talked about the retaining wall, so I put the retaining wall and they were okay with that.

665
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:20,331
[SPEAKER_02]: So I honestly think they're okay with either.

666
01:09:20,351 --> 01:09:30,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so it's easy enough for me to go into the plan and just grade it back out and just basically match, you know, what I proposed the first time, if that's what you guys would prefer.

667
01:09:33,417 --> 01:09:36,498
[SPEAKER_12]: So, if we did that, though, how would we ensure that.

668
01:09:37,378 --> 01:09:39,979
[SPEAKER_12]: Yard activities don't extend into the weapon.

669
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:54,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I know in some previous sites, which we've done in current sites is they do have sometimes posts that have weapon markers that.

670
01:09:57,520 --> 01:10:01,722
[SPEAKER_02]: that notify them, you know, this is a resource area, you can't go beyond.

671
01:10:01,902 --> 01:10:18,511
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, we've actually had to set, we're doing a job in Grafton right now, and we actually have to set all these wildlife posts out there with plaques on it that's saying, you know, basically this is a protected area back here.

672
01:10:20,172 --> 01:10:24,915
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think it would be important to establish a no-mow zone, for instance.

673
01:10:28,072 --> 01:10:40,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you be, would everyone be open to, obviously I'll go to the client and talk to them about grading it out and I'm sure it's easy enough to put some plaques out there or whatever.

674
01:10:42,725 --> 01:10:50,952
[SPEAKER_02]: So you would rather go that way versus having a retaining wall with a fence on it to act as a barrier and make sure it's not disturbed down there?

675
01:10:51,412 --> 01:10:53,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're keeping like 10 feet off, you know?

676
01:10:55,530 --> 01:10:57,911
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really what you guys think, I don't know, whatever.

677
01:10:57,931 --> 01:11:01,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

678
01:11:01,891 --> 01:11:07,833
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I was going to say, I think there are trade-offs to both approaches.

679
01:11:08,293 --> 01:11:17,915
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm leaning towards a retaining wall personally just for that barrier, but there are pros and cons to both.

680
01:11:26,135 --> 01:11:32,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so, you know, the wall, the highest it's like a four foot, like a three foot, and then it kind of tapers off.

681
01:11:32,418 --> 01:11:37,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nothing ridiculous in terms of excavation earthwork.

682
01:11:38,141 --> 01:11:41,063
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's really going to be that.

683
01:11:43,186 --> 01:12:02,485
[SPEAKER_02]: personally if the best interest of the resource here in my opinion would be probably to have the retaining wall of the fence because that's just basically someone who really have to go out of the way if they wanted to go down there and do stuff versus you know people still do what they want even though there's a plaque like you know what I mean so

684
01:12:05,697 --> 01:12:06,798
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really up to you guys.

685
01:12:06,858 --> 01:12:09,539
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really don't want the wall, then that's fine too.

686
01:12:09,939 --> 01:12:12,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I can really do whatever makes people happy.

687
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:17,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

688
01:12:18,342 --> 01:12:22,923
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry, Jeremy, were you about to say something?

689
01:12:23,063 --> 01:12:26,545
[SPEAKER_14]: I should make sure nobody else has any comments before I pipe up again.

690
01:12:26,565 --> 01:12:31,346
[SPEAKER_11]: I tend to agree that a

691
01:12:33,870 --> 01:12:38,432
[SPEAKER_11]: a low wall will provide more of a barrier to activities.

692
01:12:39,873 --> 01:12:45,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I support that and certainly see the value there.

693
01:12:45,415 --> 01:12:52,978
[SPEAKER_14]: So totally fine with proceeding with the plan as currently proposed.

694
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:01,382
[SPEAKER_12]: Any conditions that we could, well, before we

695
01:13:03,518 --> 01:13:08,944
[SPEAKER_12]: go into conditions, is there anybody from the public present that would like to comment or have a question?

696
01:13:13,769 --> 01:13:15,731
[SPEAKER_12]: Not many people left, so I was hearing none.

697
01:13:17,553 --> 01:13:21,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Any conditions that we'd like to include?

698
01:13:24,445 --> 01:13:26,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess get the best of both worlds.

699
01:13:27,346 --> 01:13:39,909
[SPEAKER_05]: If we are issuing an order of conditions that includes the wall, would your client, Mr. Marchanda, be amenable to including some signage, a post or signage near that wetland area?

700
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:44,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Just for posterity's sake, I know over time these properties transact.

701
01:13:46,071 --> 01:13:53,533
[SPEAKER_05]: It can be very unobtrusive, but I think there would be value to having that post up somewhere just as a reminder to

702
01:13:54,405 --> 01:13:57,886
[SPEAKER_05]: The owners and future owners that that is, in fact, a well in resource area.

703
01:13:59,786 --> 01:14:02,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, yeah, I don't see that being a problem.

704
01:14:02,507 --> 01:14:03,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that I appreciate that.

705
01:14:04,387 --> 01:14:05,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no problem.

706
01:14:07,528 --> 01:14:12,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Unless my colleagues object, I would propose that we include a condition that requires 1.

707
01:14:12,869 --> 01:14:23,311
[SPEAKER_05]: 1 sign do we have standards for signage on on stuff like this or.

708
01:14:25,942 --> 01:14:33,585
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we don't really, but we could put it in the including the condition that before the sign goes up, you know, like a little.

709
01:14:35,605 --> 01:14:38,847
[SPEAKER_04]: The whatever the language be sent to the environmental agent for approval.

710
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:39,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

711
01:14:40,913 --> 01:14:45,475
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do have, Dennis, if you need an example, I do have some from other towns.

712
01:14:45,875 --> 01:14:46,315
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

713
01:14:46,435 --> 01:14:46,815
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, then.

714
01:14:47,476 --> 01:14:59,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Or then, in that case, if, Caroline, you send it to me, I can send them to, send, you know, the typical ones to Adam, and then, you know, that would be, as long as those are followed, we're fine.

715
01:14:59,180 --> 01:14:59,440
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

716
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:07,864
[SPEAKER_05]: And not to be too prescriptive, but should we identify a location for this or leave it up to the owner?

717
01:15:10,742 --> 01:15:17,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I think as long as we say, you know, it's just visible from, you know, the rear looking towards the wetland as long as it's visible while looking towards the wetland.

718
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:21,809
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I think that's probably sufficient, you know.

719
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:25,611
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I mean, there is going to be a fence there.

720
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:29,173
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, ideally, probably the best place to put it would be just attached to the fence.

721
01:15:32,806 --> 01:15:36,509
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if I was a homeowner, I wouldn't want to have signage attached to my fence.

722
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:37,610
[SPEAKER_12]: That's in my back.

723
01:15:38,251 --> 01:15:41,094
[SPEAKER_12]: The signage says on the wetland line.

724
01:15:41,614 --> 01:15:41,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

725
01:15:42,315 --> 01:15:42,635
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

726
01:15:42,675 --> 01:15:44,216
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just like, oh, you mean, all right now I get you.

727
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:44,997
[SPEAKER_04]: So, like, a post.

728
01:15:45,017 --> 01:15:45,337
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

729
01:15:45,357 --> 01:15:49,801
[SPEAKER_04]: So just a post on the wetland line in the direction, but facing in the direction of the.

730
01:15:50,182 --> 01:15:51,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not disturb wetlands.

731
01:15:52,163 --> 01:15:52,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

732
01:15:52,744 --> 01:15:52,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

733
01:15:54,830 --> 01:16:02,574
[SPEAKER_04]: leave it up to them where they feel as long as it's just visible from the rear of the property facing in the direction of the wetland.

734
01:16:04,135 --> 01:16:05,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Marchando, I appreciate that.

735
01:16:06,456 --> 01:16:10,779
[SPEAKER_14]: You're welcome.

736
01:16:11,539 --> 01:16:14,200
[SPEAKER_14]: This suggestion may be covered by a standard condition, but

737
01:16:15,918 --> 01:16:22,142
[SPEAKER_14]: You've noted that the approved seed mix here will be New England Wetlands Plants mix.

738
01:16:22,522 --> 01:16:24,083
[SPEAKER_14]: They offer a number of seed mixes.

739
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:36,811
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'd ask that the seed mix that you propose to use be submitted for the commission to review prior to use or prior to installation.

740
01:16:36,831 --> 01:16:40,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Or we could just require that it be the wetland seed mix.

741
01:16:41,814 --> 01:16:43,555
[SPEAKER_14]: They probably have two or three of those too.

742
01:16:48,775 --> 01:16:51,457
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's, well, there's an erosion seed mix.

743
01:16:51,537 --> 01:16:52,277
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't want that one.

744
01:16:54,419 --> 01:16:56,540
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't know there was more than one wetland seed mix though.

745
01:16:58,121 --> 01:17:12,252
[SPEAKER_14]: I think they have mixes for different types of wetlands, but a condition that requires it to be a wetland seed mix, wet mix, that works for me.

746
01:17:18,627 --> 01:17:22,088
[SPEAKER_14]: And you're right, Heidi, there is one called New England Wet Mix.

747
01:17:22,668 --> 01:17:27,569
[SPEAKER_14]: So that seems like the right one.

748
01:17:27,589 --> 01:17:32,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.

749
01:17:33,891 --> 01:17:34,551
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I've got.

750
01:17:38,111 --> 01:17:40,212
[SPEAKER_10]: Those, so nothing further from me.

751
01:17:43,113 --> 01:17:43,333
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

752
01:17:43,753 --> 01:17:44,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Do I hear a motion?

753
01:17:48,316 --> 01:17:51,838
[SPEAKER_05]: I will make a motion to issue an order of conditions.

754
01:17:53,639 --> 01:17:55,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the project number, the file number in front of me.

755
01:17:55,920 --> 01:18:13,509
[SPEAKER_05]: I apologize, but issue an order of conditions, including the standard conditions, as well as a special condition that requires one sign identifying the border of the wetland.

756
01:18:14,877 --> 01:18:19,160
[SPEAKER_05]: and a second condition specifying the New England wet mix.

757
01:18:23,723 --> 01:18:24,823
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe that's all we talked about.

758
01:18:26,204 --> 01:18:26,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

759
01:18:27,145 --> 01:18:28,085
[SPEAKER_12]: Do I have a second?

760
01:18:28,826 --> 01:18:29,346
[SPEAKER_12]: Second that.

761
01:18:30,967 --> 01:18:32,088
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor, Caroline?

762
01:18:32,968 --> 01:18:33,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Aye.

763
01:18:33,969 --> 01:18:34,269
[SPEAKER_12]: Eric?

764
01:18:34,729 --> 01:18:34,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

765
01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:36,090
[SPEAKER_12]: Jeremy?

766
01:18:38,271 --> 01:18:39,132
[SPEAKER_12]: And myself as an aye.

767
01:18:43,933 --> 01:18:47,437
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for working with us on this, Mr. Marchando.

768
01:18:48,478 --> 01:18:48,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

769
01:18:48,978 --> 01:18:49,358
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

770
01:18:49,378 --> 01:18:50,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good night.

771
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:51,661
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

772
01:18:52,201 --> 01:18:52,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

773
01:18:56,646 --> 01:18:58,648
[SPEAKER_12]: And one more item before we sign off.

774
01:18:58,748 --> 01:19:03,512
[SPEAKER_12]: We have minutes for one hearing.

775
01:19:03,673 --> 01:19:03,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

776
01:19:03,993 --> 01:19:07,216
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I finally cracked the code.

777
01:19:08,745 --> 01:19:10,647
[SPEAKER_04]: using that software to make minutes.

778
01:19:10,727 --> 01:19:17,792
[SPEAKER_04]: It still took me a while, but it took me way less time than if I had actually just been transcribing my notes and listening to the meeting, which is what I usually did.

779
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:25,659
[SPEAKER_04]: It usually took me about twice the length of, no, two to three times the length of an actual meeting to do at a minimum, just stopping and starting.

780
01:19:25,759 --> 01:19:27,440
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's, you know.

781
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:27,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

782
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:29,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.

783
01:19:30,202 --> 01:19:35,386
[SPEAKER_12]: I've reviewed them and corrected some typos and sent them back to you, Dennis.

784
01:19:35,727 --> 01:19:35,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

785
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:38,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I've added those in, I've included those.

786
01:19:39,075 --> 01:19:41,296
[SPEAKER_04]: But it wasn't all of them.

787
01:19:41,356 --> 01:19:49,158
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that's the one slight issue is that it does some weird things that I, you know, and every time it's different.

788
01:19:49,178 --> 01:19:55,200
[SPEAKER_04]: I was doing another one and gosh, what is, I know it's, where do I have it?

789
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:03,002
[SPEAKER_04]: It basically, it was the, instead of,

790
01:20:05,464 --> 01:20:09,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Misty Valley road and just completely butchered the name.

791
01:20:09,566 --> 01:20:11,147
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just going to do a cut and paste.

792
01:20:11,167 --> 01:20:18,850
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few things like that where it just, because it's going by the audio.

793
01:20:19,171 --> 01:20:22,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Has the rest of the commission had a chance to review those?

794
01:20:25,814 --> 01:20:26,754
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm reading them now.

795
01:20:26,774 --> 01:20:29,896
[SPEAKER_11]: They're kind of long.

796
01:20:30,496 --> 01:20:30,976
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know.

797
01:20:34,053 --> 01:20:37,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I have not, but I can read them, but we can hold off voting.

798
01:20:37,735 --> 01:20:41,137
[SPEAKER_04]: And there'll be a few more as well in addition.

799
01:20:41,157 --> 01:20:42,397
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm hopefully going to try.

800
01:20:42,998 --> 01:20:43,798
[SPEAKER_12]: We can take care of that.

801
01:20:46,665 --> 01:20:49,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to give you a heads up, we are going to be getting the filing.

802
01:20:49,987 --> 01:20:52,950
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been submitted through EDEP.

803
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:56,592
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just sort of reviewing it with clients for a property on Ronald Lee Road.

804
01:20:56,612 --> 01:21:06,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many of you, maybe there was the property on Ronald Lee Road that, you know, they would basically be added on a porch in the back of their property.

805
01:21:06,179 --> 01:21:08,961
[SPEAKER_04]: It's literally the next door neighbor who just wants to add on beside their house.

806
01:21:09,021 --> 01:21:10,762
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's the exact same principle.

807
01:21:10,822 --> 01:21:13,805
[SPEAKER_04]: So Ronald Lee Road is basically, the road itself is, you know,

808
01:21:14,525 --> 01:21:19,868
[SPEAKER_04]: The property itself is probably about 10 to 15 feet higher than the resource area below it.

809
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:24,850
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very much like it comes in and then just sheer drop off to where the actual resource area is.

810
01:21:26,051 --> 01:21:29,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we did the last one, we just asked them for an RDA.

811
01:21:29,853 --> 01:21:35,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And so given that this is basically the similar type project, I said, we can do an RDA on this one as well.

812
01:21:35,615 --> 01:21:38,397
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if the board does determine to go further, we can.

813
01:21:39,217 --> 01:21:42,338
[SPEAKER_04]: given the similarity to the project site, had them go that route.

814
01:21:42,818 --> 01:21:52,680
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've sort of been helping them out with a few, like, that time we did like a cross-sectional map and like a wetland map sort of showing what the area is, just to sort of delineate exactly what it looks like.

815
01:21:52,740 --> 01:22:03,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, she submitted it through, yeah, as I said, through EDP, and then I'm sort of reviewing it now, and I'm going to just help them with a couple of

816
01:22:04,543 --> 01:22:08,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Of those types of figures since I did it for the other property and we've already done it.

817
01:22:08,807 --> 01:22:12,111
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not too much bad hearing me.

818
01:22:13,512 --> 01:22:21,059
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, you know, maybe the 12th might be too early.

819
01:22:21,139 --> 01:22:21,280
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

820
01:22:24,775 --> 01:22:26,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Since we haven't determined it, I'll let you know.

821
01:22:26,376 --> 01:22:27,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that might be the best way.

822
01:22:27,696 --> 01:22:29,037
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm just not 100% sure.

823
01:22:29,777 --> 01:22:32,498
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's right, it'd be the 12th at the earliest.

824
01:22:32,538 --> 01:22:44,882
[SPEAKER_04]: That means if I, but given everything else that just sort of, given that I have three decisions to work on in the next few days, so, and I have zoning decisions to work on too, it might, I'm gonna talk to them and get their, I'll talk to the applicant as well and get their availability.

825
01:22:44,922 --> 01:22:49,443
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe, probably I'll give them the 19th and the 26th might be more logical for that.

826
01:22:50,243 --> 01:22:51,884
[SPEAKER_12]: That's fine, yep.

827
01:22:52,680 --> 01:23:00,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting timing, Dennis, I was going to mention that I had been writing up with more broke road, which is the resource area behind these properties.

828
01:23:00,306 --> 01:23:07,652
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's been what I would characterize as some vigilante wetland clearing activity along the roadway back there.

829
01:23:09,054 --> 01:23:10,935
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens periodically and it's usually.

830
01:23:10,955 --> 01:23:17,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty minor, but you can tell people I've been talking about for lack of a better descriptor.

831
01:23:17,581 --> 01:23:19,202
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in there a couple of weeks ago and it's.

832
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:26,911
[SPEAKER_05]: far more substantial, particularly up past Ronald Lee Road, where there's often a very wet crossing.

833
01:23:28,572 --> 01:23:40,396
[SPEAKER_05]: They have some large rock, you know, three to four inch sort of broken cobble type stuff through that wet area.

834
01:23:42,887 --> 01:23:45,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but I just want to raise that for now.

835
01:23:45,069 --> 01:23:45,630
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

836
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:48,092
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's like a part that I don't get to that often.

837
01:23:48,132 --> 01:23:49,694
[SPEAKER_04]: So I will go.

838
01:23:49,734 --> 01:23:52,456
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all frozen right now, so it's hard to tell.

839
01:23:52,516 --> 01:23:58,702
[SPEAKER_05]: But once this snow sort of goes away, you can really see what they've done, including they rebuilt.

840
01:23:59,082 --> 01:24:00,143
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks to me like that.

841
01:24:00,484 --> 01:24:06,810
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a small bridge over one of the crossings, which whatever, but.

842
01:24:07,670 --> 01:24:08,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, no, that's good.

843
01:24:08,551 --> 01:24:09,251
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good heads up.

844
01:24:09,271 --> 01:24:13,455
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, that's we see those crop up every now and again through different places.

845
01:24:13,475 --> 01:24:14,816
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, I'm closer.

846
01:24:14,856 --> 01:24:15,497
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm near the.

847
01:24:16,538 --> 01:24:23,043
[SPEAKER_04]: The hospital, and every once in a while, going through the walk through there, I see something that's been sort of created and I sort of like, you know, let's just kick that off.

848
01:24:23,884 --> 01:24:26,286
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I've noticed that in the past.

849
01:24:26,987 --> 01:24:27,748
[SPEAKER_12]: On Whitmore?

850
01:24:27,788 --> 01:24:28,628
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, exactly.

851
01:24:32,592 --> 01:24:36,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anyone know the, I'm just curious, the history of that trail?

852
01:24:36,775 --> 01:24:39,836
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's interesting the way that it aligns with Placeteb Road.

853
01:24:40,537 --> 01:24:43,699
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it the Middlesex Canal at one point?

854
01:24:44,987 --> 01:24:46,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

855
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:49,471
[SPEAKER_05]: I think at one point, it was an actual road.

856
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:53,975
[SPEAKER_05]: And at one point, there was military installation up there.

857
01:24:53,995 --> 01:24:58,960
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if it was discontinued around that time when that was created or after it closed.

858
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:02,603
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on Ramshead Hill, there was a military tower up there.

859
01:25:03,304 --> 01:25:05,246
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there was a connecting between the two.

860
01:25:05,866 --> 01:25:06,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

861
01:25:06,327 --> 01:25:08,669
[SPEAKER_04]: And there were a few other, there's been a few other sort of.

862
01:25:10,190 --> 01:25:21,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Back, you know, there's old farms that are way back there years ago that have been removed and there's a lot of strange things in and around there.

863
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:24,543
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a fisher back there a couple of weeks ago too.

864
01:25:25,184 --> 01:25:26,285
[SPEAKER_12]: No way.

865
01:25:26,325 --> 01:25:26,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

866
01:25:28,747 --> 01:25:32,930
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, the canal was a bit further west of that.

867
01:25:33,491 --> 01:25:34,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Closer to the west, right?

868
01:25:35,741 --> 01:25:41,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, but are you familiar with the Winchester Town Forest that's just north of the Brooks Estate?

869
01:25:42,445 --> 01:25:43,305
[SPEAKER_12]: It's adjacent.

870
01:25:44,506 --> 01:25:47,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Say the name of it again, the Brooks-Parkhurst State Forest?

871
01:25:47,908 --> 01:25:54,652
[SPEAKER_12]: The Brooks Estate's in Medford, and so immediately to the north of the Brooks Estate is Winchester Town Forest.

872
01:25:56,513 --> 01:26:00,555
[SPEAKER_12]: They're adjacent, it's the same woods.

873
01:26:00,995 --> 01:26:04,137
[SPEAKER_12]: But within the Winchester portion, there are canal stones.

874
01:26:06,088 --> 01:26:07,870
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's an ancient sign.

875
01:26:08,571 --> 01:26:10,953
[SPEAKER_12]: Talk to a tree that says 2 canal stones.

876
01:26:11,614 --> 01:26:14,257
[SPEAKER_12]: And it points to the canal stones that are in the woods.

877
01:26:14,858 --> 01:26:20,304
[SPEAKER_12]: Sadly, a developer went and took several of them and incorporated them into a retaining wall for a house.

878
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:25,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So if anyone is interested, I'm pretty sure we still have them here.

879
01:26:25,993 --> 01:26:32,117
[SPEAKER_04]: We were gifted a box full of books that were published by the Medford Historical Commission about the canal.

880
01:26:32,818 --> 01:26:38,081
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know exactly where they are, but if anyone, I'll look for them tomorrow and if I find them, I'll let you know.

881
01:26:39,102 --> 01:26:44,407
[SPEAKER_04]: You are more than welcome to come in and read them, even if you just want it as a lending library so you can just read through it.

882
01:26:44,467 --> 01:26:52,013
[SPEAKER_04]: But I remember when we got them, basically, I think, I just, I don't, I'm not, it probably was actually John and Heather.

883
01:26:52,113 --> 01:26:54,415
[SPEAKER_04]: They probably heard me talking about it, like, hey, guess what we've got?

884
01:26:54,735 --> 01:26:59,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they just came by, you know, a day later and dropped off a box full of them for our office.

885
01:26:59,540 --> 01:26:59,660
[SPEAKER_04]: So.

886
01:27:04,358 --> 01:27:08,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to share my screen if you're looking to kill a whole bunch of free time at work.

887
01:27:09,861 --> 01:27:12,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Map junction, if you're not familiar with it.

888
01:27:13,543 --> 01:27:17,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so going back to a 1938 aerial, you can see.

889
01:27:21,128 --> 01:27:22,769
[SPEAKER_05]: What more going up through.

890
01:27:22,789 --> 01:27:28,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, I've got more question for the folks who spend time in the fills and then I'll.

891
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:34,022
[SPEAKER_14]: Let it go, but there's a up at that old Ram's head hill site.

892
01:27:34,122 --> 01:27:36,644
[SPEAKER_14]: There is what you can see used to be the fire tower.

893
01:27:37,344 --> 01:27:41,366
[SPEAKER_14]: But there's some kind of telephone pole with a metal box on the top of it.

894
01:27:42,747 --> 01:27:43,467
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that a nest?

895
01:27:43,547 --> 01:27:44,968
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it an antenna?

896
01:27:44,988 --> 01:27:45,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know?

897
01:27:45,568 --> 01:27:49,931
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a weather or air quality monitoring.

898
01:27:53,713 --> 01:27:54,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Heidi, do you know?

899
01:27:55,074 --> 01:27:57,735
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know, but I don't think it's a wildlife box at all.

900
01:27:57,975 --> 01:27:59,236
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's either military or.

901
01:27:59,745 --> 01:28:01,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, some kind of weather related.

902
01:28:01,726 --> 01:28:04,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

903
01:28:04,168 --> 01:28:06,509
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been there since I started going there in the 80s.

904
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:30,067
[SPEAKER_04]: My mother told me a story just after she started driving, she was driving on South Border Road and she had like skidded off something and drove off the road and was in a ditch and a bunch of the soldiers from the base that were stationed there at the time all came out and basically pushed the car out back onto the road and got her on her way.

905
01:28:30,087 --> 01:28:31,228
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

906
01:28:35,069 --> 01:28:35,449
[SPEAKER_12]: Excellent.

907
01:28:35,529 --> 01:28:37,210
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's good work everybody.

908
01:28:37,230 --> 01:28:38,951
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had three hearings in four weeks.

909
01:28:43,744 --> 01:28:48,405
[SPEAKER_14]: So have we cleared the deck of open NOIs?

910
01:28:48,806 --> 01:28:50,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything but South Street, which I'm working on.

911
01:28:50,926 --> 01:28:52,847
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is still there.

912
01:28:52,867 --> 01:29:00,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I just, honestly, I sent an email to the applicant, the owner, but I haven't heard back from him yet, but I only did that, I think on Thursday of last week.

913
01:29:00,228 --> 01:29:03,269
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said if he was available to please come on, but I shouldn't.

914
01:29:03,809 --> 01:29:06,930
[SPEAKER_12]: If we don't hear back, we'll have to consider other technologies.

915
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:08,831
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll basically tell him that in my next one.

916
01:29:11,011 --> 01:29:13,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Aside from that, that is pretty much it, I think.

917
01:29:14,353 --> 01:29:22,779
[SPEAKER_04]: And no other... I don't think I've gotten any other news for you all.

918
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:26,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Three hearings in four weeks and two site visits.

919
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:27,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Well done.

920
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:32,705
[SPEAKER_11]: That's more activity than we've had in some years, honestly.

921
01:29:32,965 --> 01:29:34,386
[SPEAKER_14]: My wife will be thrilled to hear that.

922
01:29:36,446 --> 01:29:37,007
[SPEAKER_14]: That does not.

923
01:29:37,047 --> 01:29:42,474
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it's not usual at all and not in particular to have.

924
01:29:44,114 --> 01:29:48,097
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have a motion to close the hearing.

925
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:17,695
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll make a motion to close the hearing.

926
01:30:19,438 --> 01:30:20,179
[SPEAKER_11]: Was that a second?

927
01:30:21,341 --> 01:30:22,723
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I second that motion.

928
01:30:22,803 --> 01:30:24,486
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, all in favor, Jeremy?

929
01:30:24,927 --> 01:30:25,127
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

930
01:30:25,888 --> 01:30:26,149
[SPEAKER_12]: Eric?

931
01:30:26,609 --> 01:30:26,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

932
01:30:27,731 --> 01:30:28,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Caroline?

933
01:30:28,733 --> 01:30:28,873
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

934
01:30:29,654 --> 01:30:30,716
[SPEAKER_12]: And myself is an aye.

935
01:30:32,699 --> 01:30:34,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you all, good work.

936
01:30:34,702 --> 01:30:35,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all very much.

937
01:30:36,365 --> 01:30:37,426
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, I'll talk to you soon.
