00:00:04,273 --> 00:00:12,298
Hey Medford Bites listeners, last week marked the beginning of new stations opening on the Green Line extension and a vote in City Council regarding charter review.

2
00:00:12,959 --> 00:00:20,964
It's exciting to see some of the innovations happening in Medford, hopefully impacting residents and businesses just like the one we talked to on today's episode.

3
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:22,005
Hope you enjoy.

4
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:29,105
All right, thank you so much for joining me today.

5
00:00:29,486 --> 00:00:33,030
If you don't mind just starting by introducing yourself, so saying your name, pronouns.

6
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:37,896
Hi, yep, my name is Justine Myers and my pronouns are she, her.

7
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,510
And so we're gonna just start with our normal questions.

8
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:48,251
So if you don't mind letting us know what your favorite place to eat in Medford is and what you like to eat there.

9
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:49,732
Okay, yeah, I've got a few.

10
00:00:50,552 --> 00:00:54,573
So the first one definitely is Chili Garden, which is in Medford Square.

11
00:00:54,753 --> 00:00:57,573
And my family is like really into it.

12
00:00:57,733 --> 00:01:01,894
And we probably ordered from there like once every week or two throughout the pandemic.

13
00:01:03,834 --> 00:01:07,095
And I like all this Szechuan kind of food there.

14
00:01:08,575 --> 00:01:09,917
I mean spicy and not spicy.

15
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:17,126
The next one would be El Vaquero which is a little Mexican takeout place in West Medford.

16
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:25,336
It's about halfway between Acupuncture Together and my house so sometimes I will stop by for lunch in the middle of the day and it's really great.

17
00:01:25,356 --> 00:01:26,397
The tacos are delicious.

18
00:01:27,658 --> 00:01:33,303
And next door to us is Pikachi Ramen, and they have really delicious miso ramen.

19
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:45,493
I walked here from West Medford Square and I'd never been to this part of Boston Ave, but we're sitting here in your business, Acupuncture Together, so I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit about it.

20
00:01:46,046 --> 00:01:57,256
Sure, so I opened Acupuncture Together in 2008 and it was in Cambridge at the time and we just moved to Medford last spring in May.

21
00:01:58,918 --> 00:02:03,042
It's myself and one other acupuncturist, his name is Andrew Cheever.

22
00:02:04,002 --> 00:02:07,303
And so we're both licensed acupuncturists.

23
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:14,666
And just so folks are familiar with acupuncture, it's pretty highly regulated in Massachusetts.

24
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:17,947
So we both went to acupuncture school.

25
00:02:18,427 --> 00:02:20,508
My acupuncture school was three years year round.

26
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:27,289
I went to the New England School of Acupuncture and got a master's degree.

27
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:32,290
I studied both Chinese style acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicine.

28
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:42,631
And then you take board exams, national board exams, and then you become licensed by the Board of Registration in Medicine in Massachusetts.

29
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:43,872
So it's quite a process.

30
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:50,613
And so I graduated acupuncture school in 2007, opened Acupuncture Together in May of 2008.

31
00:02:52,710 --> 00:03:07,940
and was really excited to move to Medford last spring since I live here and I had been looking for quite a while actually to move out of that space and find something different and the space we're in now has been a really great fit.

32
00:03:12,172 --> 00:03:15,434
I don't know, I guess I can talk about what we do, but yeah.

33
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:22,037
I'm curious, actually, if you've noticed any differences between being in Cambridge and Medford, if anything's changed with that move.

34
00:03:22,097 --> 00:03:28,481
Yeah, I mean, one thing that's really different is that the space we're in now is a nice little storefront.

35
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:31,863
It's right here in the neighborhood, and in the space we were in in Cambridge, we were

36
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:33,804
hidden away in an office building.

37
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:36,807
So nobody could ever see that we existed.

38
00:03:36,827 --> 00:03:38,008
There was no foot traffic.

39
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:41,611
And so it's just been really nice being here in the neighborhood.

40
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:42,571
People walk by.

41
00:03:43,132 --> 00:03:47,535
We definitely get people who come in who say that they found us because they drove by or they walked by.

42
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:49,457
They live in the neighborhood.

43
00:03:49,657 --> 00:03:53,640
And I just love knowing that we're serving people who are right here.

44
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:58,664
And of course, there's people who come and find us from all other kinds of ways, whether it's like

45
00:03:59,425 --> 00:04:07,649
internet or a friend or family or doctor or something, but the neighborhood presence is really nice.

46
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:15,374
So maybe a question that might help us kind of segue to some of the other things we want to talk about is like, I feel like people make a lot of assumptions about acupuncture.

47
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:18,215
Like you started kind of qualifying like your credentials, right?

48
00:04:18,255 --> 00:04:27,040
And so I wonder what you, like kind of what you think about when you think about like assumptions or like ideas that people have about acupuncture that may or may not be accurate.

49
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:35,284
Yeah, so I think that a lot of people think the idea of acupuncture is scary because there are needles involved.

50
00:04:35,364 --> 00:04:41,953
And needle phobia is certainly something that a lot of people have, and it is legit and valid.

51
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:50,098
I will say that acupuncture needles are much, much thinner than hypodermic needles like used for a shot.

52
00:04:50,198 --> 00:04:58,382
Like, for example, you could fit about, I've read, you know, 25 or 27 acupuncture needles into the tip of a hypodermic needle.

53
00:04:58,823 --> 00:05:01,044
They're super thin, they bend easily.

54
00:05:01,224 --> 00:05:11,229
If you're not an acupuncturist and you try to stick one in yourself or someone else, it would probably bend and it just, it takes actually a lot of skill and practice to know how to,

55
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:16,094
put in an acupuncture needle properly because they're so thin.

56
00:05:16,374 --> 00:05:18,778
And what else?

57
00:05:18,838 --> 00:05:23,864
Acupuncture is just, it's, it treats a lot of health conditions.

58
00:05:25,647 --> 00:05:28,350
I think there are people who think that

59
00:05:30,045 --> 00:05:47,420
You know, I was just speaking, I just was wanting to say my credentials up front because I actually was having a discussion with an MD this past weekend who said, oh, you know, I've thought from time to time about referring people for acupuncture and I always go to the school because I want to make sure they're going to someone who's

60
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:53,389
really train, and I said, oh, well, there's really nobody who can practice without being trained.

61
00:05:53,429 --> 00:05:54,711
It is very highly regulated.

62
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:59,497
Which, I mean, is actually, that's a whole other sort of, I think, good and bad thing.

63
00:06:01,317 --> 00:06:05,339
which I may get into later, but that's, so that's the way it is.

64
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:09,421
And then I will, at some point I would talk about what it's good for, but.

65
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:09,881
Yeah.

66
00:06:10,602 --> 00:06:12,883
And so I'm glad you brought up the needle phobia piece.

67
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:20,527
My wife actually was like suggested to her at some point in like the pregnancy, along the way with the pregnancy that like she tried it and she's like got a huge needle phobia.

68
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:26,730
And so are you saying like, because of the size of the needle, it's like not painful or less painful than what we think about with a shot?

69
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:45,665
right so um i mean and i do treat there are definitely people who come in in here and are like you know it was really recommended to me to try it i'm really nervous about needles and i'm like okay no problem you know i have treated a lot of people who are nervous um and most of them are fine i will say i've had a couple people who just

70
00:06:46,285 --> 00:06:52,633
you know could not handle it but generally speaking most people are fine and actually surprised at how little they feel the needles.

71
00:06:53,554 --> 00:07:03,206
Sometimes when a needle is inserted you might feel like a small pinch or a bit of an achy feeling but it's not really painful it's definitely not at all

72
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:06,587
like the sensation of a shot or a blood draw.

73
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:09,969
That is much more intense and uncomfortable.

74
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:12,210
I mean, it is painful having those things done.

75
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:23,735
And with acupuncture, what we do is we put a needle in, and we just, once it's in, it sits there in the body for about, most of our treatments here are about 45 minutes.

76
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:28,837
But you know, it could be a half hour to an hour at pretty much any place where you get acupuncture.

77
00:07:30,146 --> 00:07:33,128
And once the needle's in, you don't really feel it.

78
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:34,690
Great.

79
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,012
What else would you like us to know about that?

80
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,015
Yeah, so here at Acupuncture Together,

81
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:49,811
What we do is we do what's called community acupuncture, which is treatment in a group space.

82
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:59,133
So we have six recliner chairs in here and people can go have a seat and people don't have to remove their clothes at all since it's a group space.

83
00:07:59,374 --> 00:08:01,774
So they will take their shoes and socks off.

84
00:08:01,794 --> 00:08:05,475
They can roll their sleeves up toward their elbows, roll the bottoms of their pants up toward their knees.

85
00:08:06,355 --> 00:08:16,322
And we do primarily what are called distal point treatments, which means most of the points we use are away from an area of pain or discomfort.

86
00:08:16,882 --> 00:08:28,470
So, for example, if someone has lower back pain, which is like definitely in the top five things we treat, might even be number one, we regularly use points in the hands and in the feet and ankles.

87
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:31,704
very, very good success rate treating it.

88
00:08:31,724 --> 00:08:38,709
So you do not have to put a needle right where it hurts, which is one misconception about acupuncture.

89
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,672
So we treat people in a group setting, and we have sliding scale pricing.

90
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:49,098
The first visit is a flat rate of 50, but the follow-ups are 25 to 50.

91
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:52,921
And when I first opened in Cambridge, it was 20 to 40.

92
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:59,936
Yeah, the sliding scale was 20 to 40, and we had a $15 extra for the first visit.

93
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:24,097
But then when we closed for the pandemic and moved and everything, actually before we moved, but after we reopened, because we had to close for three months in the old place, then we, I changed the sliding scale just a little bit, so now it's 25 to 50, because so many less people were coming, and so we had to

94
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:25,457
make that decision.

95
00:09:25,757 --> 00:09:34,640
But the importance of the sliding scale is, you know, we do it to try to make it as accessible to as many people as we can.

96
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:39,462
So, you know, anyone who needs to pay 25, that's totally fine.

97
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,403
And if people are able to pay a little more to help, you know,

98
00:09:45,313 --> 00:09:52,900
keep everything rolling here and help make it possible to have that lower end of the scale for people, then that is a huge help.

99
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:56,203
And we don't ask for any income verification or anything.

100
00:09:56,243 --> 00:10:02,568
We have some kind of guidelines and they're really just based on ultimately it's what people feel that they can afford.

101
00:10:02,588 --> 00:10:05,011
So making it more accessible.

102
00:10:05,511 --> 00:10:07,553
How does insurance work with acupuncture?

103
00:10:07,895 --> 00:10:15,139
Yeah, so we don't bill insurance and part of it's because we have a sliding scale and you can't do both.

104
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:23,062
But the other part is that some plans cover some acupuncture for some conditions.

105
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:27,805
So, like my actually, my health insurance plan doesn't cover acupuncture.

106
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:31,887
So it'd be kind of interesting if I were.

107
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:37,392
billing for that and not able to use it myself, but yeah.

108
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:48,162
So the other thing is, so people will ask and if their insurance covers it, what we're happy to do is they can pay us, we will write them a receipt that they could try to submit for a reimbursement.

109
00:10:49,123 --> 00:11:13,727
But you know there are acupuncturists who bill insurance and there are Plans that cover it so if people really want that they can call their insurance company and ask sometimes there'll be a limit like you know 12 treatments a year which would be fine if you have something that is Not a long-term chronic condition, but that's another thing where we see a lot of people with long-term chronic conditions for example there's someone who comes here who has a

110
00:11:14,224 --> 00:11:21,161
chronic knee pain and you know she's like 70 and acupuncture has been great for her and it helps her to not have to take

111
00:11:22,665 --> 00:11:32,295
you know things like ibuprofen or acetaminophen but she comes like weekly almost all year or sometimes she skips a week here and there.

112
00:11:33,337 --> 00:11:38,863
And you know insurance would not cover that level of care.

113
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:42,086
And you mentioned that like back pain, knee pain are some of the common ones.

114
00:11:42,126 --> 00:11:44,809
What are the sort of major treatments that you do?

115
00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:55,895
Yeah, so I would say in the top most common things would be any kind of pain, joint pain, back, knee, elbows.

116
00:11:58,156 --> 00:12:21,639
any kind of pain really, and then a lot of headaches and migraines, also a lot of stress and anxiety, insomnia, and a lot of fertility, and also just female reproductive health in general, menstrual and menopausal type issues.

117
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:29,195
conditions, digestive conditions, and also allergies and asthma.

118
00:12:30,035 --> 00:12:34,336
I'd say those are the most common, but all kinds of people come in with all kinds of stuff.

119
00:12:34,657 --> 00:12:43,200
I feel like we talk about acupuncture as an alternative medicine, as a way to divert, or if other medicine hasn't worked.

120
00:12:45,349 --> 00:12:49,573
And I guess I'm wondering how you see that play out here.

121
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:57,061
Are there certain types of people that you see come in, or is there a general story that describes a lot of your clients?

122
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,691
It is very mixed.

123
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:08,373
I mean, there are people who, there are definitely people who come in who are sort of at the end of their rope and at the end of their options.

124
00:13:08,434 --> 00:13:15,876
They have had cortisone shots in their joints and they have had physical therapy and they have had massage and they have seen a chiropractor.

125
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:17,196
You know, they've done all these things.

126
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:24,199
And I will say that it is harder to treat someone when they have a very longstanding and severe condition than

127
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:29,324
treating someone who has something that is newer or less severe.

128
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:36,192
Usually things that are newer and less severe respond pretty quickly and the long-standing things can take more time.

129
00:13:38,174 --> 00:13:38,774
to improve.

130
00:13:39,515 --> 00:13:43,297
But yeah, I mean, it's quite a variety.

131
00:13:43,337 --> 00:13:54,925
I mean, and there's also people who come in because their doctor or their therapist had suggested that because they're really having a hard time with something like anxiety or stress management.

132
00:13:55,105 --> 00:13:59,427
Or just a family friend said to them, oh, it helped my knee, why don't you try?

133
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:01,208
And so they come in because someone told them.

134
00:14:02,503 --> 00:14:04,184
Can you describe a little bit about how it works?

135
00:14:04,284 --> 00:14:09,967
So you're putting needles into different parts of the body, but how does that actually work?

136
00:14:10,287 --> 00:14:16,930
Yeah, well, so there are certain points that are indicated for certain conditions.

137
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:27,315
So part of the time, you know, a lot of the time spent in acupuncture school studying what points affect what area of the body.

138
00:14:28,415 --> 00:14:29,396
And so those are kind of

139
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:42,044
known in a more sort of empirical sense of that this medicine, you know, it started over 2,000 years ago.

140
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:52,350
The first classical text of Chinese medicine, the Huangdi Nejing, which is called the, which is translated to the Yellow Emperor's Classic, is from

141
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,152
roughly 200 BC.

142
00:14:55,392 --> 00:15:08,284
But at that time, they had recognized that certain points could be used for certain conditions and sort of laid out this whole map of the way that the body works in a certain sort of system.

143
00:15:08,344 --> 00:15:18,974
And so we approach it from that standpoint, we being acupuncturists, but we also know that there are certain things in the body that happen when you insert a needle, such as like

144
00:15:19,514 --> 00:15:41,935
that it improves circulation in an area or it decreases inflammation in an area or that there's Sending signals to the brain, you know There have been studies where you put a needle here and it lights up in an MRI Like an area of the brain that's connected to a certain part of the body so like for instance there was a study on carpal tunnel like that a few years ago where they could see a

145
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:45,797
that the needle in a certain place lit up that part of the brain.

146
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:49,899
So there's that neurological response, too.

147
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,780
So there's a lot of ways.

148
00:15:52,340 --> 00:16:01,485
So it's kind of you're, in a way, tricking the brain or redirecting the signals of the brain to the pain center?

149
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:01,945
Yeah.

150
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:05,287
I mean, with pain, particularly chronic pain,

151
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:22,926
there's like this signal that just keeps going off and it just keeps going and going and going and going even if you're not actually, even though you had that maybe injury a long time ago and it just keeps happening.

152
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:27,610
And so the back puncture needles help to kind of like quiet that area down.

153
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,491
Interesting.

154
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:34,095
Part of my training is in substance use disorder and the ways that we interpret pain.

155
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:44,398
And learning a lot about the opioid epidemic, how we've been trained to think about pain as a vital sign.

156
00:16:44,438 --> 00:16:47,399
And when you go to the doctor, you're asked, how much pain are you in?

157
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:48,859
And the expectation is no pain.

158
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:56,182
So yeah, I guess it's interesting to think about how our associations with pain dictate some of these treatments.

159
00:16:57,002 --> 00:17:08,068
And with substance use disorder, actually, I'm glad you mentioned that because there's an actual, there's an acupuncture, sorry, an acupuncture ear protocol.

160
00:17:08,108 --> 00:17:17,093
It's on the ear lobe, and it's five points, and it's, there's this organization called NADA, which is the National Acupuncture Detox Association, and they,

161
00:17:19,194 --> 00:17:38,763
they train people to do these types of treatments, not only acupuncturists who can do these types of treatments, but other healthcare providers or other people, and it helps a lot with, as a support, as an adjunctive type of therapy, like something in your toolbox for addiction, substance use disorder treatment.

162
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:46,747
So it helps people with reducing their anxiety, helping them improve their sleep, helping reduce cravings,

163
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:53,095
And it's a nice, very basic, simple kind of a treatment.

164
00:17:53,135 --> 00:18:03,599
In fact, there's actually a bill that's in Massachusetts right now where we're trying to make it possible for non-acupuncturists to be able to administer that.

165
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:13,526
like in a kind of group setting where people are needing treatment for that sort of thing.

166
00:18:13,767 --> 00:18:14,047
Wow.

167
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:19,934
And you mentioned one thing I wanted to ask about is you mentioned you do sort of group acupuncture here.

168
00:18:19,954 --> 00:18:22,436
What's the benefit of that versus just an individual?

169
00:18:23,345 --> 00:18:29,470
Okay, yeah, well, it is nice being in a group sort of space.

170
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,772
I think a lot of people actually do enjoy that.

171
00:18:32,873 --> 00:18:36,417
You can come in with someone else and get treated at the same time.

172
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:41,961
As far as making it accessible goes, we can treat more people at the same time.

173
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:47,887
So here we can treat up to six people in an hour versus if you go to a private

174
00:18:48,807 --> 00:19:00,412
treatment that the acupuncturist might see somewhere from like one to four patients an hour depending on their setup and so it just makes a lot more appointments available throughout the day each day.

175
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,573
Yeah, it really does improve on the accessibility piece.

176
00:19:07,953 --> 00:19:09,274
Makes me wonder about HIPAA.

177
00:19:09,354 --> 00:19:12,616
Are you bound to the same sort of standards of privacy and confidentiality?

178
00:19:12,636 --> 00:19:20,322
Yeah, so HIPAA is about electronic records, so it's not about doing something in a group or not doing something in a group.

179
00:19:20,382 --> 00:19:24,225
But the other thing is, in terms of privacy, whenever people are concerned about that,

180
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:34,954
We, I mean right now it's silent in here, but we have a lot of white noise in the room and we have some quiet music and we also talk very quietly.

181
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:41,300
I'll just, you know, be right up next to someone at their chair and I'll whisper, you know, how are you feeling today?

182
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,522
And so people in the room might hear a

183
00:19:44,885 --> 00:19:48,746
but they don't necessarily hear the actual description.

184
00:19:48,806 --> 00:20:02,448
The other thing is that I am sensitive to people's conditions, and I don't always go into using the words about their condition, particularly if it's a more, what someone might consider more private.

185
00:20:03,408 --> 00:20:08,889
So I might use code words like, is your digestion too fast or too slow?

186
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:10,770
And again, I would be whispering it.

187
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,510
But so it really kind of covers up

188
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,891
what's going on if someone were to hear anything.

189
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:20,352
It's not something that people have ever complained about.

190
00:20:22,773 --> 00:20:31,176
Maybe I can talk a little bit about community acupuncture too and the history because that's actually really important here.

191
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:33,577
When I was in acupuncture school,

192
00:20:34,615 --> 00:20:50,019
Community acupuncture, which again is treating people in a group setting and having a sliding scale payment or kind of a low price payment, was a relatively new concept here in the United States and in Canada.

193
00:20:52,513 --> 00:21:02,481
There was a clinic that sort of was, I mean, there could have been others that we don't know about, but the sort of origin that we all know about is out in Portland, Oregon.

194
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,183
It's called Working Class Acupuncture.

195
00:21:04,403 --> 00:21:07,245
And they opened, I want to say, in maybe 2002 or 2003.

196
00:21:07,285 --> 00:21:11,008
And I was in acupuncture school, my last year was 2007, and there was a woman who had had an accident.

197
00:21:17,774 --> 00:21:21,961
been practicing community acupuncture out on Cape Cod and she came to speak at acupuncture school.

198
00:21:23,103 --> 00:21:24,225
Her name's Diana DeGioia.

199
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:26,669
She has a clinic called Community Acupuncture on Cape Cod.

200
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:27,550
It's out in Dennis.

201
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:31,076
And I went and listened to her speak about it and

202
00:21:32,387 --> 00:21:38,395
I was really interested right from after what she had said.

203
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:47,586
She had been doing private treatments for a long time, and she had people who had been struggling to be able to really afford to come as often for treatment as they needed.

204
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:57,311
I don't know what she was charging at the time, but I will say the going rate for acupuncture at that time was probably in the $60 to $75 a treatment range.

205
00:21:57,712 --> 00:22:14,280
Nowadays, a private treatment is more, I would say, in the $80 to $100 range, which if you need to get treated weekly or twice a week or even three times a week and say for somewhere like

206
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,998
you know, 8 to 12 treatments or more.

207
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:21,568
Maybe you're one of those people who has a chronic condition and needs to come every

208
00:22:23,019 --> 00:22:28,142
you know, once every week or two, or maybe once a month, but just all year long.

209
00:22:28,743 --> 00:22:32,946
That really can add up, and it can make it really inaccessible for people.

210
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:45,454
And so anyway, she, at the time, had switched her practice over to doing community, and she said there were a lot of people who were able to really come more often then, and weren't having to, you know, choose on what they were gonna be able to afford in their lives.

211
00:22:45,534 --> 00:22:50,357
And healthcare is important, and it's something that we have to, you know,

212
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,929
that we need to do to take care of ourselves.

213
00:22:56,229 --> 00:23:05,000
And then at the time there was an organization called the Community Acupuncture Network, which now is called POCO, which stands for the People's Organization of Community Acupuncture.

214
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:10,567
And so it was online and there were all these acupuncturists from around the country who were starting to practice

215
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:21,136
community acupuncture and so I linked up with a lot of them and learned from a lot of people and also helped teach other people because it was really like a way of sharing the knowledge.

216
00:23:22,557 --> 00:23:24,399
And so it helped make

217
00:23:25,306 --> 00:23:33,209
community acupuncture more widely available, and there's clinics all over the place in the United States now, and in Canada, and in other parts of the world.

218
00:23:33,249 --> 00:23:34,229
In England, there's some.

219
00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:35,550
They call them multi-bed clinics.

220
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,991
In Israel, there's some.

221
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:46,293
The idea of it being in a group, in China, it's common, it's standard.

222
00:23:46,353 --> 00:23:46,994
If you go to a

223
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:58,449
They have hospitals in China where there's a lot of acupuncture and they'll have people sitting around in chairs getting treated in large rooms.

224
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:14,295
Or an interesting piece of history about acupuncture here in the United States is the, in the 1970s, the Black Panthers and the Young Lords used, they did the five-year needle protocol

225
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,743
for, to help people detox from heroin.

226
00:24:20,104 --> 00:24:21,646
And that was in a group setting.

227
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:28,792
That was before that NADA, the National Acupuncture Detox Association started.

228
00:24:29,853 --> 00:24:39,902
So it's not, I mean it seems rare here because of the way that our medical care happens here, which is that everything is so private, you know?

229
00:24:40,162 --> 00:24:41,383
But it's not actually,

230
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:43,063
uncommon.

231
00:24:44,325 --> 00:24:57,904
It's interesting that you're bringing up the cost and accessibility and how I can imagine just the way that our medical system works, access to care for people can be tricky and so being able to pay what you can

232
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:14,428
within this sliding scale, I can imagine, say somebody has come to this country and they came from a place where acupuncture was really accessible and commonplace and something that they relied on and then coming here, and I don't know, at least for me, the association with

233
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:17,590
acupuncture and like chiropractics.

234
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:25,153
It's like that's something that we have to pay for out of pocket and it's expensive and it's inaccessible and so something like this sort of really changes that.

235
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:28,354
Yeah and we've also worked pretty hard.

236
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:32,876
I feel like I've tried to lower any possible barriers.

237
00:25:32,916 --> 00:25:34,077
I mean you do not have to

238
00:25:35,328 --> 00:25:37,371
find out whether insurance will cover it or not.

239
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:41,857
We are here seven days a week between Andrew and I, so there's appointments every day.

240
00:25:41,877 --> 00:25:45,042
And you can just book your appointment online.

241
00:25:45,463 --> 00:25:47,285
If you need help, you can call and we'll help you.

242
00:25:47,305 --> 00:25:51,511
We used to have receptionists, but after the

243
00:25:52,860 --> 00:26:01,322
the close with the pandemic and the reopening, our number of treatments that we were giving went down so substantially that unfortunately we don't have them anymore.

244
00:26:01,362 --> 00:26:04,042
But we used to be able to help people a lot more on the phone.

245
00:26:04,082 --> 00:26:16,344
But anyway, the point is that we do try to make it really easy to get acupuncture, to just try to have as few barriers as possible to people getting care.

246
00:26:17,524 --> 00:26:20,165
And what's kind of brought you to acupuncture?

247
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:26,006
Yeah, I mean, I always have been interested in health and health care, like since I was a little kid.

248
00:26:26,526 --> 00:26:28,607
It's been always something I gravitated towards.

249
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:35,349
And I found that acupuncture is really just, I found it interesting and also enjoyable.

250
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,592
My first experience with acupuncture was for the treatment of sciatica.

251
00:26:40,612 --> 00:26:47,175
I used to run a lot and I would get bouts of sciatica and acupuncture was really helpful for it.

252
00:26:47,675 --> 00:27:00,262
I'd done a bunch of other, I mean, mostly I'd done some physical therapy and with some milder results, but the acupuncture was quite helpful.

253
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:04,114
So some personal experience with acupuncture, great.

254
00:27:04,614 --> 00:27:09,537
What's the best way for folks to get in touch with you to learn more about your treatment?

255
00:27:09,617 --> 00:27:16,881
Yeah, just if you visit our website, that has as much information I think as you would need.

256
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:20,683
Our website is acupuncturetogether.com.

257
00:27:21,303 --> 00:27:26,506
You can also, if you want to just check us out on Instagram and Facebook, you can.

258
00:27:26,926 --> 00:27:27,347
That's not

259
00:27:28,242 --> 00:27:33,045
So much information that's more, I mean, tidbits of information here and there and photos and things.

260
00:27:33,806 --> 00:27:42,792
But yeah, our website is the way to find out all the info about what we treat, how much it costs, how to make an appointment, everything like that.

261
00:27:42,892 --> 00:27:43,152
Great.

262
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:47,835
And what's the sort of time, like, so if somebody calls, how long do they usually wait till they can get in?

263
00:27:48,803 --> 00:27:52,645
to make an appointment, like today or tomorrow.

264
00:27:52,725 --> 00:27:53,385
That's another thing.

265
00:27:53,425 --> 00:27:56,287
We have appointments pretty much every day.

266
00:27:56,327 --> 00:28:00,849
I mean, some days the schedule fills up a day or two ahead of time, particularly like Saturdays.

267
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:03,771
But other days, usually there's availability.

268
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:04,811
Well, thank you so much.

269
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:05,992
This was really informative.

270
00:28:06,732 --> 00:28:08,053
Anything else you want to make sure I mention?

271
00:28:08,513 --> 00:28:09,794
No, thanks so much for having me.

272
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:10,154
Thank you.

273
00:28:16,326 --> 00:28:17,687
