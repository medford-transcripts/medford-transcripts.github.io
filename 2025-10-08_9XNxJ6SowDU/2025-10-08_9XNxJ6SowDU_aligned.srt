00:00:00,451 --> 00:00:10,755
Please be advised that on October 7th, 2025 at 4.30 PM, there will be a rules and policies subcommittee meeting held through, excuse me, remote participation via Zoom.

2
00:00:11,275 --> 00:00:12,676
This meeting is being recorded.

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:25,296
The meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable channel, Comcast 9, 8, or 22, Verizon 43, 45, and 47.

4
00:00:26,456 --> 00:00:31,959
Since the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log or call in by using the following link or number.

5
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:45,970
There's no phone number listed, but if you are actually listening to this, then you probably already know all that.

6
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,933
We should get the phone number on those agendas.

7
00:00:51,835 --> 00:01:02,198
Additional questions or comments could be submitted during the meeting by emailing me at pruseau at medford.k12.ma.us.

00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:13,000
Those submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, or if you are an employee, just indicate that, your question or comment.

9
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,962
The agenda for today is to take up the motion to move the management of life-threatening allergies policy to the Rules and Policy Subcommittee as

10
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:23,804
amended to include staff in the policy.

11
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:26,206
I forget the date.

12
00:01:26,246 --> 00:01:28,848
This was, I think it was May when we did that.

13
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,551
So it's 24 pages.

14
00:01:34,912 --> 00:01:38,255
So let me just- June 18th.

15
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:39,616
June 18th.

16
00:01:39,676 --> 00:01:40,096
Thank you.

17
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,758
Oh, I need to take a roll call.

18
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:45,500
Let me open up my mail and record that.

19
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,904
Member Grant.

20
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:51,980
Here.

21
00:01:53,222 --> 00:01:53,882
Member Bramley.

22
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:54,583
Here.

23
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:56,765
And Member Rousseau.

24
00:01:57,846 --> 00:01:58,247
Here.

25
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:59,488
All right.

26
00:01:59,608 --> 00:02:00,309
All present.

27
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:01,711
We have a quorum.

28
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:12,691
So I wanted to start off with if anybody has any specific parts of this that they want to talk about, we can go to that.

29
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:19,794
I don't think reading a 24-page policy is going to get us done in the next six months.

30
00:02:21,694 --> 00:02:25,836
And it's actually all on the agenda, so hopefully people have had a chance to read it.

31
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:30,718
I will screen share when we get to that part, when people have something they want to look at, so we don't have to

32
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:33,821
to the imagine if you will kind of approach.

33
00:02:35,102 --> 00:02:43,050
I want to welcome the superintendent, Mr. O'Leary, our new director of, I forgot the technical title of the department is.

34
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:45,592
Athletics, is that right?

35
00:02:45,973 --> 00:02:47,094
Is it just called department?

36
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:48,315
Sorry, I should know that.

37
00:02:48,996 --> 00:02:51,919
And of course, our director of nursing.

38
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,280
Sorry.

39
00:02:53,961 --> 00:02:54,862
In community schools.

40
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,440
Okay, and community schools, right.

41
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,800
And I thought it was longer than that.

42
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,801
And our Director of Nursing, Ms.

43
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:05,564
Silva, and we also have our Director of Food Services, Rhetta Smith.

44
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:11,827
And I think that's everybody I should be acknowledging real quick.

45
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:17,110
So does anybody want to start with any comments on this?

46
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,691
This is not our first rodeo on this.

47
00:03:20,151 --> 00:03:24,914
I just have a couple of questions.

48
00:03:27,003 --> 00:03:34,427
Um, so when we talked about this back in June, we talked about, um.

49
00:03:35,327 --> 00:03:42,831
Wanting to engage some of the folks who are, I'll say, implicated in this policy.

50
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,035
who we don't particularly have direct control over, like the PTOs in particular.

51
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:52,101
Rob is here from an athletics perspective, so that's great.

52
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:57,489
And I'm just curious if that has been done and what the feedback was.

53
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:06,398
So I did send this to the PTO leaders.

54
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:08,759
I have not heard back from really any of them.

55
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:20,225
When we were developing this policy, though, we did speak to some PTO members who gave us feedback on what was here, which is why some of the items that are included here are included in the policy.

56
00:04:21,486 --> 00:04:22,706
And what was their feedback?

57
00:04:24,167 --> 00:04:29,190
I feel like overall, our PTOs are super

58
00:04:30,162 --> 00:04:42,310
interested in helping, but this, to me, my read of this is that we are substantially changing how PTOs are being asked to operate when it comes to food.

59
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,172
So I'm just curious what their reactions were.

60
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:46,693
Yeah.

61
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:48,774
Shanine, are you on the call?

62
00:04:48,794 --> 00:04:53,937
Because I think she had a little bit more feedback from PTOs than I did.

63
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:55,578
I am.

64
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,901
I'm just walking back from the skate park opening, so pardon.

65
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:07,996
So we spoke at length with both Misituk and Roberts PTO.

66
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:14,839
And I mean, I guess I want to take a step back really quickly, and I will answer that question.

67
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,543
But I want to start this meeting acknowledging that the reason we are here is because children can die.

68
00:05:22,523 --> 00:05:24,344
That is the reason we are doing this policy.

69
00:05:25,565 --> 00:05:27,566
There is a fear every time.

70
00:05:27,626 --> 00:05:28,146
Go find the back.

71
00:05:29,227 --> 00:05:29,927
Because I told you to.

72
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:29,987
Go.

73
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:52,804
There is a fear every time I send my child or any of us with children with life-threatening allergies, send our child to soccer practice or lunch in the cafeteria or a birthday party or any of that, that someone is going to make a mistake and we are going to get that call.

74
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:55,365
That is why we are here.

75
00:05:56,926 --> 00:05:58,347
And we want to make sure that it is easy.

76
00:05:58,407 --> 00:06:00,068
And I don't think anything in this policy

77
00:06:01,593 --> 00:06:03,895
is an unreasonable expectation for anybody.

78
00:06:05,296 --> 00:06:20,750
But I just wanted to ground us, because I think that in June when we met, that part, that importance of why this policy needs to exist, and the reason we made the recommendations we did, is to keep children safe and included in their school communities.

79
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:27,456
So as for the PTOs, the brown boots,

80
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:35,559
And mesothelioma already does a lot in terms of considering allergies.

81
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:57,770
And Robert talked about there being a difference between when the PTOs are serving food as a fundraiser purpose, when the grownups are going to be buying food, and when they are serving food to children for some sort of special event, and the importance of labeling.

82
00:06:58,269 --> 00:06:59,190
So, um.

83
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,014
And and did we lose?

84
00:07:08,274 --> 00:07:08,554
Sorry?

85
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,555
No, I'm here.

86
00:07:10,075 --> 00:07:11,396
Did we get any feedback from.

87
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:15,198
The middle schools are in the high school, because I think.

88
00:07:16,708 --> 00:07:20,049
The conversation changes over time, right?

89
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:27,792
As someone with a life-threatening allergy myself, I 100% understand the need for the policy.

90
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:46,378
I just am trying to understand how we have engaged the people whose workflows, as they were, we're asking to change so that we can be useful and helpful to them as they do that.

91
00:07:48,397 --> 00:07:51,940
Yeah, unfortunately, we did not hear back from middle school and high school PTOs.

92
00:07:54,082 --> 00:08:01,690
So I do think that we are asking for a change, but to follow on what Shane said, I don't think any of it's really unreasonable.

93
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:08,816
I think a lot of it is going to just focus around, one, making sure that people are aware of food allergies, because I think that part of what

94
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:12,459
this policy is attempting to do is just make sure people are more educated.

95
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:21,506
You know, there was just, for example, homecoming was last weekend and a kiddo came to the high school nursing office asking if there was going to be an option for kids who were gluten free.

96
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:25,089
And at that moment in time, there were not any options for kids who were gluten free.

97
00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:29,152
And so the school nurse and the principal worked together to make sure that that would happen.

98
00:08:29,712 --> 00:08:37,275
And so I guess what we're trying to say is, hey, like we need people to be aware of these things so that we do make sure that one, we're keeping kids safe and that we're being inclusive.

99
00:08:37,295 --> 00:08:40,376
And I think those are the two pieces that this is trying to accomplish.

100
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:47,138
Yeah, and I think that's like actually a great example, right, like.

101
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:58,682
If you don't have a food allergy yourself and there's, by the way, a million versions of food allergies, so even if you have one, it doesn't mean you're particularly tuned in to them all.

102
00:09:00,948 --> 00:09:13,150
And without the right support, the organizers of events are doing their best and not intending really to cause a problem.

103
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:18,871
And then there's like this like scramble that happens when this comes up.

104
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:28,073
So I think one question, the reason that I am asking about their involvement is because I think we have to, for this policy to be successful,

105
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:49,223
we have to figure out how to shift that conversation so that it is not happening at the last minute when people begin to feel excluded, when people are already sort of in like final prep mode, right?

106
00:09:49,743 --> 00:09:54,247
And now we're saying, drop everything about your day and help us solve this problem.

107
00:09:54,507 --> 00:09:58,470
So I think one question that I, the reason that I care so much about this is because

108
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:05,548
think if done right, we can be hugely assistive in this process.

109
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:12,369
And I'm curious what that looks like at different levels.

110
00:10:12,409 --> 00:10:19,411
I think the conversation's completely different at elementary school than it is at high school for a whole variety of reasons.

111
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:26,072
So I do want to hear their voices in this conversation, because I think that's super important.

112
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:32,157
Um, the other thing that struck me about this policy is that.

113
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:41,421
There's a lot going on in this policy that makes it that I think is going to make it hard for us to get compliance against it's 22 pages.

114
00:10:42,382 --> 00:10:48,385
It does include roles and responsibilities, which are governed by labor contracts.

115
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:52,607
So, it, it's not enough for us to, like.

116
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:01,663
put it in a policy and then expect that everybody will be able to do those things.

117
00:11:02,383 --> 00:11:05,064
There are some tentacles there that we have to think through.

118
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:22,710
But I think overall, if there is a way for us to separate the policy from the education and the assistive pieces of this, I think all of those pieces will get much more use.

119
00:11:23,852 --> 00:11:30,695
than this living in its current format, because I think the current format is hard to digest.

120
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:35,377
And I don't think that's the intention.

121
00:11:35,417 --> 00:11:37,478
I think it's intended to be very useful.

122
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,261
But I think it has to be parsed a little bit differently for that to really work in practice.

123
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,460
Okay.

124
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,181
And I think, I mean, I do think that makes sense.

125
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:54,424
I think the intention was, the way we tried to make it more user-friendly is that you are a teacher and you go directly to your section.

126
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,785
You are an administrator, you go directly to your section.

127
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:58,605
So that is why it's so long.

128
00:11:58,645 --> 00:12:02,207
It's because we really tried to parse out, okay, who's responsible for what different things.

129
00:12:02,707 --> 00:12:11,650
But I do, and actually Rob and I had this conversation earlier today about needing to involve our collective bargaining and what are we looking at when we're looking at roles and responsibilities as well.

130
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:12,751
So that totally makes sense.

131
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:24,476
I do think that we could reconvene our team who's worked on this to look at how do we parse out the policy and then have those roles and responsibilities as like separate appendices that are in here.

132
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:28,797
If that would be a good way to do it, I would be open to any thoughts.

133
00:12:29,978 --> 00:12:31,759
Yeah, my thoughts on this are

134
00:12:33,135 --> 00:12:46,295
you know, just from a policy hygiene, my new favorite word around policy, is that, you know, we can have, and the way the structure of policies, there's like a national policy,

135
00:12:48,478 --> 00:13:04,006
sort of like the old Dewey Decimal System, if you will, there's like a structure that makes no sense to anybody, but that there is one, is that we have like the top level policy, and then you have other policies that are just under it rather than part of the same policy.

136
00:13:04,766 --> 00:13:11,870
And what I like about that is that you can really target, well, you can target

137
00:13:13,064 --> 00:13:41,572
training you can you know say building administrators you really all need to know this and it's not 24 pages long as as we all agree is too much um but also there's so much that is in here that different people who are coming the different audiences of this are just not interested in like this isn't relevant to them so um by burying it there um we're asking an awful lot of people to um

138
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:49,816
to find it, get lucky and find it in the index of, you know, a whole page index.

139
00:13:50,536 --> 00:14:03,942
So, yeah, breaking it up so that it is, meets the different audiences, but also the different purposes that multiple audience members might come to this.

140
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:07,104
Shanine?

141
00:14:09,805 --> 00:14:13,907
I want to push back a little bit on the length of it being so problematic because

142
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:22,505
part of the whole design was to make sure that you could figure out without having to parse all the different roles, what is the role of this person?

143
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:23,586
What is the role of this person?

144
00:14:23,626 --> 00:14:27,049
And it repeats those things a lot, which is a lot of the length of it.

145
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,873
But it actually should be easier to find like, I'm a para, what's the policy?

146
00:14:31,893 --> 00:14:43,503
What's my responsibility versus what is my lead teacher's responsibility versus the health director, all of those things that actually divides those roles in a way that's much clearer.

147
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:56,077
And I do want to remind this group that we all of these even splitting out the roles was based on the recommendations of the best policies group at food allergy research and education and the CDC.

148
00:14:57,698 --> 00:14:58,378
Yeah, I certainly.

149
00:15:00,087 --> 00:15:06,930
when I think about a policy that's here's the policy that is just pointers to the other sections like the index.

150
00:15:10,571 --> 00:15:15,853
I don't want to suggest that I'm lazy but when I see a 24-page document I have to read

151
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:18,774
I don't just plop down.

152
00:15:18,814 --> 00:15:24,276
I have to figure out when do I have time to read 24 pages, even though I might only really need to read two.

153
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:30,279
It's just like when we get emails and they scroll and scroll and scroll.

154
00:15:30,539 --> 00:15:33,520
I'll get to that later, which often means we don't get to it.

155
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:37,202
And I don't think of that as just a time management problem.

156
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:38,942
I think that is information overload.

157
00:15:43,117 --> 00:15:46,121
Like, yeah, so that's just my thoughts.

158
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:57,797
I mean, we did take the bullying policy down from, I don't remember, dozens of pages down to a number that we all agreed there's no excuse for not having read it.

159
00:15:59,013 --> 00:16:05,377
Um, but I think that, you know, I mean, some of the people who will be needing this are working three hours a day.

160
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:18,124
Um, so when are we expecting them to, I mean, I guess that's professional development and administrative management problem, not mine, but, uh, superintendent, I think you have something you want to say.

161
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:27,730
I think having been at multiple levels in the district, I think something like this is important.

162
00:16:29,115 --> 00:16:32,578
to make sure that we're providing information.

163
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:43,006
Something like food allergies is something that is constantly ever-evolving, fluid, new allergies are coming on all the time.

164
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:56,036
There's a lot of conversation and discussion at every school building between the nursing office, caregivers, teachers, school leaders, and

165
00:16:58,258 --> 00:17:14,464
every time there are like new allergies that are added to this list and then ways that you have to now think in order to prepare spaces and make students make sure that students are included and that those pieces are there on behalf of our students.

166
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:20,607
So I think the informational part and the discussion part is for sure needed

167
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:27,315
um, around food allergies, food allergy awareness, food allergy training.

168
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:33,423
I think the only, you know, the piece that's like really resonating with me is that there, because

169
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,202
It's the way it's organized.

170
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:44,928
I appreciate having all the different roles and responsibilities right there for our employees and for our community.

171
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:57,379
But we we just have to do a level of communication that I think we haven't really done yet in terms of like having getting people around a table and talking to them about what this means.

172
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,722
I don't think it's something that we can just like send out.

173
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:06,049
and then expect that people are gonna like read it, and there's this like level of compliance.

174
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:10,192
Of course, member Graham already mentioned.

175
00:18:10,992 --> 00:18:15,813
the piece around a lot of these people are bargaining members that we really have to work through.

176
00:18:15,914 --> 00:18:26,597
But there's just a lot of, in my opinion, levels of conversation that we just have to have before I think we can proceed with making this an official policy.

177
00:18:27,017 --> 00:18:29,398
And I don't know if the conversation is, is this a policy?

178
00:18:29,518 --> 00:18:30,318
Is this guidance?

179
00:18:32,098 --> 00:18:34,339
But I just think we need to plan some conversations.

180
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,320
Yeah.

181
00:18:44,228 --> 00:18:44,988
Um, can you hear me?

182
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:45,849
Yes.

183
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:46,409
Okay.

184
00:18:47,109 --> 00:18:48,970
Um, I think it's, I think it's both.

185
00:18:49,090 --> 00:19:00,995
I think there are clear policy statements in here, like threats of harassment for students with food allergies will be taken seriously and dealt with in accordance with a reference to our bullying policy.

186
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:02,396
That is a policy statement.

187
00:19:03,596 --> 00:19:09,118
There, an allergy table is not something we're going to do as a policy statement.

188
00:19:09,158 --> 00:19:10,459
And I think those things belong.

189
00:19:11,348 --> 00:19:18,290
like in a compressed format in terms of like what we as a collective are and aren't going to do.

190
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:22,351
But the second part of it is the guidance.

191
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:30,514
And I do think it's super helpful for people to have guidance that like they can go to their part and understand what their part is.

192
00:19:30,534 --> 00:19:30,594
And

193
00:19:32,495 --> 00:19:39,517
there should be one for coaches because coaches are gonna deal with like a kind of a different, a different like slice of all of this, right?

194
00:19:40,778 --> 00:19:43,679
Then PTOs, then paras.

195
00:19:43,719 --> 00:19:51,942
So that piece to me, like sort of like snaps out and becomes guidance.

196
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:57,504
Like this is our policy, this is where you go for guidance and the guidance,

197
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:11,864
I would like my preference would be that the maintenance of that guidance can reside with the director of nursing and not necessitate, like, a big policy review.

198
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:17,186
If something has to change, because I think what will happen in practice is things will evolve and change.

199
00:20:17,763 --> 00:20:19,104
And we want to be responsive to them.

200
00:20:19,124 --> 00:20:22,266
And as soon as your documentation is out of date, it is useless.

201
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:33,974
So we can't, you know, if something needs to change because it was confusing or in practice, like, somebody asked a question and we're like, that's a great point.

202
00:20:34,094 --> 00:20:34,835
We should include that.

203
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:37,056
We should include that in the guidance for PTOs.

204
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:49,317
Whatever that may be, like, being able to change it so that that guidance is applicable and resonates with the people it's intended to be supportive of is.

205
00:20:52,162 --> 00:20:52,962
to me, ideal.

206
00:20:53,302 --> 00:21:00,644
And that doesn't happen in a policy that requires subcommittee and multiple readings, right?

207
00:21:01,224 --> 00:21:05,165
If something is needing to be changed in real time, I want it to be able to be changed in real time.

208
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:09,206
So I think if we think about, to me, there's two pieces, policy and guidance.

209
00:21:10,026 --> 00:21:16,748
And there's maybe some overlap of things that are not going to change in a really wily way, right?

210
00:21:17,268 --> 00:21:18,488
But I think

211
00:21:20,023 --> 00:21:25,507
I want to get both pieces right and put the right things in the right bucket.

212
00:21:27,349 --> 00:21:34,274
So I don't think it's necessarily that structurally the repetition is bad.

213
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:40,439
I think that repetition belongs in the guidance and not in the policy.

214
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:47,545
But when I look at policy, actually, I was just talking to somebody about our AI policy.

215
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:49,613
And it was also very long.

216
00:21:50,454 --> 00:21:54,197
And I said, in summary, our policy is this.

217
00:21:54,277 --> 00:21:56,278
And I said it in like two and a half sentences.

218
00:21:57,319 --> 00:21:58,500
It was very long.

219
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:02,924
And it substantively was the same as two and a half sentences.

220
00:22:03,024 --> 00:22:10,590
So I'm always a fan of the policy being like really crisp and concise so there can be no confusion.

221
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,331
We don't do allergy tables.

222
00:22:12,851 --> 00:22:14,052
We take bullying seriously.

223
00:22:14,092 --> 00:22:16,895
Whatever those things are so that

224
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:23,066
It's simple to know what we're expected to implement.

225
00:22:24,046 --> 00:22:25,767
The guidance then has to back it up.

226
00:22:26,908 --> 00:22:30,630
So I think, to me, that's like there's two things happening in this document.

227
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,191
And they both have to happen.

228
00:22:33,751 --> 00:22:36,273
But I don't think they should happen in the same document.

229
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:39,895
Bob.

230
00:22:40,874 --> 00:22:49,517
Yeah, so I just saw this this morning for the first time, but a couple of things that I can't agree with more that was just said almost so.

231
00:22:49,797 --> 00:22:52,879
But the biggest thing I think from athletic standpoint is.

232
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:55,239
I want more parents involved.

233
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,482
I want more people involved and I feel like like the first line of like a couple of things like.

234
00:23:02,022 --> 00:23:09,007
Team dinners, like we have to have a menu set before that, like that, that is an athletic director as a coach is going to be next to impossible.

235
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:11,169
And I'm not a fan of putting policy in that.

236
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:20,095
We can't follow through with, you know, if we have a team dinner that we didn't even know about because the kids put it on or the parents put it on or something outside of the school.

237
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:22,998
Jen and I talked about this this morning a little bit.

238
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:27,940
You know, that's a lot different than something that's happening inside of the school or at somebody's house, right?

239
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,262
I love the fact, a lot of districts use like a letter that is sent out.

240
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:43,366
I did a little quick research after Jen and I met this afternoon that is sent out to like a team that says, doesn't tell you who, but somebody on the team has celiac disease.

241
00:23:43,446 --> 00:23:47,087
And if you're planning a team dinner, please be aware of this, right?

242
00:23:47,107 --> 00:23:48,768
So if we could get that information and then

243
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:59,121
You know, foster it out through the nursing office or through my office, I guess me is like, if we can, if we can get that information and then get it out to the teams.

244
00:23:59,762 --> 00:24:04,107
And it doesn't have to be a policy, but more of a guidance of, like.

245
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:13,723
You know hit hit someone on the team has has this allergy or someone on the team has this allergy and then we can hope that the parents follow through with that.

246
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:22,047
And also I think that the the biggest thing I saw in that was you know just the.

247
00:24:23,913 --> 00:24:39,130
The change of a job description for a coach, if we're making it a policy as a former union president, I would say that we'd have to at least change our job descriptions and added somewhere in the job postings when we're doing it that.

248
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:45,354
We want them to take the allergy course and pass it because right now they're not doing that.

249
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:52,478
And if we're going to do that, we should probably add it in for the next season that we're going to post coaching positions.

250
00:24:52,538 --> 00:24:53,358
We have concussions.

251
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:57,900
We have things that Jen and I talked about earlier, the concussion, the CPI, the first aid.

252
00:24:58,501 --> 00:25:06,445
It's not a major thing to add it, but we should add it if we're looking to get that done sooner rather than later.

253
00:25:07,694 --> 00:25:13,236
But the team dinner thing is what jumped out at me right away, because sometimes we don't even know about a team dinner that happens.

254
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:33,462
I guess my question, and this is not my general sphere, but what's the difference in terms of enforceability between a guidance and a policy?

255
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:42,658
I mean, even just what Mr. O'Leary just said of hoping the parents follow through on that, like, team dinners are a prime issue for kids having accidental reactions.

256
00:25:43,356 --> 00:25:47,698
So I just, what is the difference, Paul, between or?

257
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:50,759
Yeah, the difference, there's no difference.

258
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:58,101
Both written policy of the school committee as well as guidance that the superintendent essentially is issuing.

259
00:25:59,162 --> 00:26:02,523
In both cases, it's the superintendent who's responsible for enforcement.

260
00:26:03,723 --> 00:26:07,565
So it really falls to how the superintendent is willing to enforce

261
00:26:10,206 --> 00:26:28,277
So anything that is not, so we don't have a life-threatening allergy policy today, but that isn't that we don't actually have, we don't have an official school committee policy, but the district and the superintendent, what they say is policy unless we have overridden it.

262
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:35,920
So everything that's missing from our policy manual is not, it's just a wild west.

263
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:54,487
It's up to the central administration and what they say is policy if the school committee has not spoken on it, which of course is totally the opposite of anything legislative in any other setting where until the legislative body has said something, it doesn't exist.

264
00:26:56,028 --> 00:27:02,392
But I think that's part of the 1993 Ed Reform Act that gave that kind of authority to superintendents.

265
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:11,318
And some of it is just to principals too, which I find a little annoying that sometimes principals have authority that actually the superintendent doesn't have.

266
00:27:12,218 --> 00:27:13,839
But anyways, we don't need to rehash that.

267
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:19,063
But I think the team dinner is like a really good example of like we,

268
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:37,778
we can have a policy, but without the right support in place, a parent with good intentions could do something that causes harm, right?

269
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:42,141
And nobody's intending to do that.

270
00:27:42,982 --> 00:27:49,166
But the question then becomes, to Shanine's point, about consequence, right?

271
00:27:52,026 --> 00:27:57,330
consequence a parent who didn't provide an alternative.

272
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:58,791
What are we going to do?

273
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:00,552
Kick their kid off the team?

274
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:03,894
Are we going to suspend the kid?

275
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:09,338
We don't have enforcement authority in those situations.

276
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:15,002
So what we have to do instead is make it exceedingly easy for people to be able to comply.

277
00:28:15,642 --> 00:28:17,844
And so when you talk about team dinners,

278
00:28:19,133 --> 00:28:31,744
It should be, I think, pretty simple for the coaches at the beginning of the season, when they finalize their roster, to collect the food allergies that are there.

279
00:28:31,984 --> 00:28:39,090
And then if there is a parent who is wanting to host a dinner, that list can be passed to them.

280
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:44,275
So it's not their responsibility to go ask all the kids

281
00:28:45,135 --> 00:28:46,236
what their food allergies are.

282
00:28:46,376 --> 00:28:53,662
And at the high school level, by the way, you're going to get more answers from the kids than you are from the parents.

283
00:28:54,562 --> 00:29:00,827
And only if the kids sort of decide to respond.

284
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:06,352
And it doesn't mean they're not going to show up at your house like, surprise, I have this allergy.

285
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,273
And now there's something happening.

286
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:13,037
So I think there are some ways for us to engage

287
00:29:14,494 --> 00:29:20,697
with some basic systems in place to be proactive.

288
00:29:20,777 --> 00:29:26,580
And then at the beginning, when the coaches are having their meeting with parents, they're saying, we want to have team dinners.

289
00:29:27,481 --> 00:29:28,882
We encourage you to do that.

290
00:29:28,982 --> 00:29:35,105
And if you're going to do that, here are some things that you need to know about our team so that we can keep everybody safe.

291
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:36,646
And then it's not about like,

292
00:29:37,406 --> 00:29:41,330
failure and consequences, which we really don't sort of have the authority to do.

293
00:29:41,851 --> 00:29:44,874
But instead about, let me make this easy for you.

294
00:29:45,014 --> 00:29:46,856
Like, Lucas wants to have a team dinner.

295
00:29:46,897 --> 00:29:49,840
And I was like, okay, we can do that.

296
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,183
What do you serve a bunch of teenage boys?

297
00:29:53,263 --> 00:29:55,426
Like, it seems like it would be very complicated.

298
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:58,729
And he said, Oh, he went to a team dinner and they serve lasagna.

299
00:29:58,749 --> 00:29:59,090
And I'm like,

300
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,232
Wild that no one has celiacs.

301
00:30:01,252 --> 00:30:03,356
I don't know if that's true or not, right?

302
00:30:03,856 --> 00:30:06,541
But I was like, well, I'm glad everyone liked lasagna.

303
00:30:06,561 --> 00:30:08,063
And then he's like, well, there was a lot left over.

304
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,806
And I'm like, maybe they didn't like lasagna.

305
00:30:09,826 --> 00:30:11,168
It's hard to know, right?

306
00:30:11,749 --> 00:30:13,452
The team changes all the time.

307
00:30:15,287 --> 00:30:19,430
I think as a parent, I'm happy to open up my home and do those things.

308
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:30,478
But it sure would be nice if somebody could hand me a little roadmap on how to do that and be successful, both in a safety perspective.

309
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:35,682
And also, I'm not serving anyone shellfish in my house, because that is my life-threatening allergy.

310
00:30:37,583 --> 00:30:40,905
There's plenty of others that would happen that sort of evolve in my house.

311
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:44,427
I just realized I was eating a container of nuts while we were talking, ironically.

312
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:52,611
But it sure would be nice if it could just be a little bit easier for people to engage in those ways that we want them to.

313
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:57,953
And it would keep everyone safe, too, which is actually the point.

314
00:30:58,594 --> 00:31:02,676
I think parents will as much appreciate the assistance

315
00:31:05,032 --> 00:31:07,733
in being able to show up for their kids in these ways.

316
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:13,997
So I think I just have one question.

317
00:31:14,937 --> 00:31:23,962
If we were to sever part of the responsibilities, all of these boxes of what everybody is going to do, where do we put it and how do we enforce it?

318
00:31:25,502 --> 00:31:26,863
Is there really a way to enforce it?

319
00:31:26,923 --> 00:31:28,464
I mean, as it being guidance?

320
00:31:33,553 --> 00:31:34,293
I mean, we don't.

321
00:31:34,734 --> 00:31:35,974
We're kind of doing it now.

322
00:31:36,154 --> 00:31:36,755
And you know what I mean?

323
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:38,136
Probably not to this extent.

324
00:31:38,236 --> 00:31:39,296
I mean, I was a para.

325
00:31:39,756 --> 00:31:46,300
So, you know, that was always a topic of conversation, especially in the classroom day to day.

326
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:55,165
We we always I don't think there was ever a class that didn't have an allergy of some sort in there and having snack, especially as kindergartners in the classroom.

327
00:31:55,865 --> 00:31:58,326
It was something that was, you know, the topic at all times.

328
00:31:58,386 --> 00:32:01,686
I check snacks as a para just to make sure everybody was safe.

329
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:14,809
So, I mean, I guess to have some sort of guidance is great because I think sometimes we do lack that with, you know, lots of different things, you know, like you kind of get put in a position and you're like, OK, this is what I'm doing now.

330
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:24,331
But how do we separate maybe these boxes of responsibilities for people without violating anything in the

331
00:32:25,576 --> 00:32:26,917
CBAs, right?

332
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:36,140
How do we incorporate all of this to be good guidance, but a really crisp policy on its own?

333
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,521
So first off, our muscle is the superintendent.

334
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:41,742
She is our enforcer.

335
00:32:42,923 --> 00:32:46,984
And I hope somebody does an AI version of that.

336
00:32:47,404 --> 00:32:54,027
But I think what you would find in policies that would be something like the superintendent

337
00:32:55,242 --> 00:33:12,854
or designee, sorry, will create and maintain roles and responsibilities and annually ensure that all relevant staff are aware of those instead of specifying what those are.

338
00:33:12,874 --> 00:33:24,643
And I think that that is, you know, when you think about like federal legislation, like that legislation almost always says some department will go off and figure out what we really meant.

339
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:30,075
That's what most laws do not say actually what should happen.

340
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:49,049
They say somebody who's an expert will go off and write the regulations, CMF, the regulations that make sense because the legislators, and in this case, the school committee, even if we do have it, the problem is that, and remember Graham mentioned this earlier, is that

341
00:33:50,706 --> 00:33:56,473
our ability to respond quickly to needs to changes in policy is limited.

342
00:33:56,493 --> 00:34:04,864
I mean, just by the number of meetings we have and by the fact that we have 180 backlogged policies, we still need to update.

343
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:08,488
And frankly, I have been working to get this done since

344
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:15,673
Tony was the director like we were communicating back then.

345
00:34:16,794 --> 00:34:22,978
And so we at that time we were also taking the, you know, throw it all in kitchen sink kind of approach.

346
00:34:24,178 --> 00:34:25,119
So I think that.

347
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:34,124
In that time we haven't had official school committee policy, and I think part of that is because we were including too much and.

348
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:38,747
At this hands up so who was next?

349
00:34:41,938 --> 00:34:42,498
Maybe it was me.

350
00:34:43,339 --> 00:34:43,819
All right.

351
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,580
Go ahead, Jen.

352
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:50,983
I just want to say, so clearly, we were trying to make this as easy as possible for people.

353
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:53,785
That's part of why we broke it down into the roles and responsibilities.

354
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:58,207
I definitely see the difference between having this policy and this guidance.

355
00:34:58,267 --> 00:35:03,310
But to Nicole's point, yes, the superintendent can help us and for us.

356
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,473
But a lot of this is stuff we're already doing, already asking of people to do that they're not doing.

357
00:35:08,386 --> 00:35:17,451
So for example, when we're asking principals to not have allergy tables in their cafeterias, there are schools- And you have an implementation problem.

358
00:35:17,732 --> 00:35:19,453
You don't have a policy problem, right?

359
00:35:19,873 --> 00:35:20,193
Okay.

360
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:21,534
Yeah.

361
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:33,501
So, and I think whether it's policy or guidance, like it only works if you're gonna roll it out and you're gonna tell everybody what's expected of them.

362
00:35:34,101 --> 00:35:35,282
And until you do that,

363
00:35:35,906 --> 00:35:41,857
The compliance is not going to be there, not because people are being willful and ignoring.

364
00:35:42,638 --> 00:35:46,224
Maybe maybe they are at the moment, but.

365
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:55,172
From a change management perspective, you have to tell people what you expect of them before you can expect to see change.

366
00:35:55,712 --> 00:36:12,884
So once we figure this out, there probably needs to be some professional development that is targeted so that not just does everyone understand what the policy is, but they understand why, so that they can get on the bus with the change.

367
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,446
And carrot, stick, we're going to use them all.

368
00:36:16,727 --> 00:36:27,517
If people still have allergy tables, there needs to be some dialogue about why and what help do they need to make the move in their building because the move is happening.

369
00:36:27,657 --> 00:36:30,580
So tell us what you need and then let's make that happen.

370
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,881
That's how you make change.

371
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:36,165
So once this is all said and done, there does have to be

372
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:41,913
Uh, like, a re, level 2nd, there are people who've been in our buildings for, like, 25 years.

373
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:43,634
So, like, I've been here for 25 years.

374
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,056
Of course, I know about allergies.

375
00:36:45,816 --> 00:36:54,145
Well, do you maybe you thought you did, but you don't so you so we do have, like, that to me is about implementation.

376
00:36:54,945 --> 00:37:03,794
and having a thoughtful implementation plan that goes with this so that the coaches have a space to go and be like, Rob, this is just too much.

377
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:05,836
I don't know how I'm going to do this.

378
00:37:06,136 --> 00:37:10,561
We need people to articulate those kinds of reactions and implementation.

379
00:37:11,121 --> 00:37:18,729
Because only once they do, can you then work that apart and actually help them be successful.

380
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:27,413
But it's a little bit more complicated than just saying, do what I told you to do, if what you really want is compliance and results.

381
00:37:28,734 --> 00:37:30,095
So it's incredibly painful.

382
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:36,479
And Rhetta has her hand up, so I don't wanna like jump, although I am jumping in front of her, I'm sorry, Rhetta.

383
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:45,864
But I think that just, I just wanna like kind of punctuate what you just said, member Graham, only because that's the piece that I'm talking about when I mentioned that

384
00:37:47,594 --> 00:37:50,956
we have to have explicit, intentional conversations.

385
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:53,898
And to my knowledge, those haven't started yet.

386
00:37:54,399 --> 00:38:01,424
And if they, on a global level, that's going to meet all of these roles right here.

387
00:38:02,224 --> 00:38:10,270
And that's the piece that I think is where we need to go in the next, like as our next step to this.

388
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,071
Because I don't know,

389
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:21,606
I don't know how explicit it's been or how many conversations have been with the specific roles that are listed here.

390
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:24,907
And I think Jen and I can do that.

391
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:29,049
With Retta.

392
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:31,490
Sorry, go ahead.

393
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:32,880
That's okay.

394
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:55,411
Um, I wanted to, um, I don't know if it's a point of clarification or just, uh, maybe I'm a little bit confused, but I, um, thought that with this policy, really our intention, um, and talking about PTOs and other activities was going to be things that were, you know, explicitly sponsored by the schools or part of the PTOs.

395
00:38:55,671 --> 00:38:56,452
And Jen has.

396
00:38:57,442 --> 00:39:13,525
thing, I don't know, substantive assistance or something that makes the PTO kind of come under the authority of the school policies, rather than a parent who wants to invite all the kids over on a

397
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:23,295
team to have dinners, you know, if the booster club is, you know, putting it on, I know like the track dinners we did in the school.

398
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:28,557
So of course, like we followed lots of rules with those meals that were being provided.

399
00:39:30,277 --> 00:39:37,919
And just trying to say that it's not like if anybody wants to try to feed kids outside of school hours, these rules do not apply to them.

400
00:39:38,019 --> 00:39:41,980
But I think just in my experience,

401
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:58,106
there are things that are being put on by the schools or the PTOs that aren't considering the needs of students who have food allergies, many of them who have 504s that explicitly say that accommodations will be made, but they're not.

402
00:39:58,426 --> 00:40:03,147
And they're just, it's not really something that's being considered.

403
00:40:04,727 --> 00:40:07,068
Oh, thank you for bringing that up.

404
00:40:07,128 --> 00:40:08,348
This is sort of a question I don't,

405
00:40:11,247 --> 00:40:31,860
I don't know the answer to, but if you have a team of 20 students, 20 athletes, and the coach, every time there's a change in the roster says, or at the beginning of the season, can I get a list of food allergies so that I can send this around to the parents?

406
00:40:34,381 --> 00:40:35,902
I'm just wondering about,

407
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,653
And when there's 20, that's one thing.

408
00:40:39,953 --> 00:40:41,815
What if it's a very small group?

409
00:40:43,497 --> 00:40:46,600
Or one kid joins and now there is a food allergy.

410
00:40:48,703 --> 00:40:52,146
How do we deal with the privacy related issues there?

411
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:56,191
And I don't know what they are, what they aren't.

412
00:40:56,531 --> 00:40:58,393
And I'm just very curious about that.

413
00:41:00,578 --> 00:41:06,365
Because obviously keeping people safe isn't just, it can't just be on us.

414
00:41:06,546 --> 00:41:09,389
It's like with the summer school stuff that we've offered.

415
00:41:10,311 --> 00:41:18,521
If a kid's on an IEP and they don't want the summer camp folks that we have to know, well then that kid will go.

416
00:41:19,565 --> 00:41:33,562
the disabilities that the kid has will not be known by the staff, which is not ideal, but we can't just hand over that kind of information, even to people that work for us in the summer program.

417
00:41:33,662 --> 00:41:36,485
So I'm curious about that.

418
00:41:36,566 --> 00:41:37,747
And Jen, do you have an answer?

419
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:43,597
Yes, so we obviously can't provide lists of students matched to their food allergies.

420
00:41:43,617 --> 00:41:45,259
We can provide general information.

421
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,567
But the other thing that we can do is ask parents to provide that information on sports registrations on club registration.

422
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:54,971
So this is something that Mississippi Tech does really well with their after school clubs.

423
00:41:55,552 --> 00:41:58,352
they ask for that information on the afterschool club registration.

424
00:41:58,412 --> 00:42:04,894
So that way it's the parents providing that information directly to the afterschool club volunteers or, you know, cause it's run by the PTO.

425
00:42:05,614 --> 00:42:08,794
Rob and I actually talked about today that we can incorporate it into sports registration.

426
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:16,496
So that is not, and it's not on us, like the nurses sharing that information or the trainer, it's the parents sharing that information directly.

427
00:42:17,856 --> 00:42:24,957
And you could also just ask the parents to say, I am also authorizing that this can be shared with

428
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:25,430
Yep.

429
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:29,902
people on the team who may be involved in providing food, right?

430
00:42:29,942 --> 00:42:41,551
Like I think you could also ask parents like at registration, which is like the perfect place to do it because whether you're going to respond to the coach mid-season or not, like you do have to register your kid.

431
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,293
So like that is the perfect place.

432
00:42:44,394 --> 00:42:55,823
And if you're willing, you know, and if you say, yes, my kid has an allergy and yes, you can tell people about it, then it's a real, it's a real easy thing for the coach to hand over the list to somebody who needs it.

433
00:42:56,689 --> 00:43:01,391
Um, and I also think, like, when you're talking about team dinners, you're usually talking about high school.

434
00:43:02,232 --> 00:43:04,513
And by the time high school rolls around, like.

435
00:43:06,173 --> 00:43:13,376
Food allergies are something kids are very accustomed to, like, there's food allergies all around them all the time and.

436
00:43:15,935 --> 00:43:18,177
Kids talk.

437
00:43:18,237 --> 00:43:24,821
Kids are going to talk about that stuff much more openly, I think, than if you were talking about much younger kids anyway.

438
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:33,968
So I tell everybody who needs to know about my life-threatening allergy, because it's like a defense mechanism, right?

439
00:43:34,048 --> 00:43:40,613
It's how I keep myself safe when somebody puts shellfish stock in something that has nothing to do with shellfish.

440
00:43:41,113 --> 00:43:44,236
So I do think that's a great.

441
00:43:46,036 --> 00:43:56,446
operational way to collect and distribute this information without putting the district in the middle of privacy concerns.

442
00:43:56,706 --> 00:43:58,848
But we could also run that by our attorney.

443
00:44:00,189 --> 00:44:02,572
It all sounds operational.

444
00:44:02,612 --> 00:44:04,513
It can be operationalized.

445
00:44:05,134 --> 00:44:06,876
I had forgotten about registration forms.

446
00:44:06,976 --> 00:44:07,857
I was just thinking

447
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:11,679
the coach sends a list to the nurse and the nurse writes a list back.

448
00:44:11,759 --> 00:44:16,040
And that kind of made me nervous because then what does the coach do with the list?

449
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,200
Sends it out to parents.

450
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:23,922
That freaked me out a bit, but glad to see there's an alternative to that.

451
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:28,683
So looking at the policy right now,

452
00:44:31,374 --> 00:44:46,607
I'm looking at the sections and what parts I think would be better as statements that the superintendent will create and maintain guidance.

453
00:44:48,015 --> 00:44:52,856
updated at some regular frequency, published on our website.

454
00:44:52,936 --> 00:44:55,817
I feel like that's kind of language we can plop in a bunch of places.

455
00:44:57,137 --> 00:45:07,900
Because I think having it visible outside of just, you know, training purposes would be helpful because, you know, Shanine and others will be like,

456
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,401
checking it out and being like, oh, look at that.

457
00:45:11,421 --> 00:45:15,502
That doesn't look like it's been updated with this new information.

458
00:45:16,483 --> 00:45:22,545
Because, you know, there's always more information than there is time to consume it.

459
00:45:22,745 --> 00:45:25,106
So I think having that very publicly facing

460
00:45:27,087 --> 00:45:33,271
It's also worth noting that the policy itself can include links to district resources.

461
00:45:34,772 --> 00:45:45,459
So, you know, if we establish a, just establish a URL or a webpage, a landing page that has stuff, and we can include that right in the policy.

462
00:45:45,499 --> 00:45:50,422
Because, I mean, people will come at this from different perspectives and different

463
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,161
points of knowledge.

464
00:45:52,521 --> 00:46:00,008
Some people will be like, I go to the Medford School Committee's policy website all the time, which I'm sure is just me and six other people.

465
00:46:00,408 --> 00:46:04,012
But you know, I don't know who they are.

466
00:46:05,113 --> 00:46:05,673
I'm one of them.

467
00:46:06,034 --> 00:46:11,619
But anyways, but you know, if they do that, I think it's important that they can find that.

468
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:12,540
I also think that

469
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:22,819
I'm always trying to be considerate of future school committees because the administration, the employees of the district, you have an awful lot to do.

470
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:26,301
And I remember when I joined, I was a headache.

471
00:46:26,401 --> 00:46:31,063
I was meeting with every director and asking them all kinds of questions.

472
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:39,407
And I wasn't always pleased with the answers, but it'd be nice if the answers were actually things I could have gotten on my own so you could keep doing your work.

473
00:46:40,801 --> 00:46:47,776
Um, so having that as facing outward is, I think, really important, Suzanne.

474
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:50,241
I just want to also say when

475
00:46:51,893 --> 00:47:04,144
Because of the length of this, when we do get this to a place where it's ready, or to your point when you talked about wanting to have this forward-facing on the website, very important.

476
00:47:05,005 --> 00:47:17,475
We need to have all things there that are accessible to families, but I do think this is a document that we would want to send out for translation because of the length and because of the content, and that also has a little bit of a

477
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:32,247
turnaround time, and also to just be mindful that whatever links we're putting in here that directs families to other resources, that we know that we're directing families to translated links.

478
00:47:33,218 --> 00:47:34,959
Absolutely, yes, that's a good point.

479
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:41,260
So how does this sound for the next little bit?

480
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:48,142
That we go through the sections and we identify sections we think would be better as guidance.

481
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,563
I'm not going to draft the exact language right now.

482
00:47:51,583 --> 00:47:53,464
I can do that when we're not all meeting.

483
00:47:53,944 --> 00:47:57,425
But to just essentially do what I said,

484
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,026
the superintendent will blah, blah, blah.

485
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:03,866
I don't have to repeat what I said earlier.

486
00:48:05,567 --> 00:48:12,909
And I just think it would be good if we're all on the same page about what sections we really think need to stay in the policy.

487
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:16,710
And I don't think we'll all necessarily agree on that.

488
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:21,491
But is this fitting on everybody's screen?

489
00:48:21,571 --> 00:48:22,851
I have a massive monitor.

490
00:48:22,931 --> 00:48:26,492
So is this fitting comfortably for you all?

491
00:48:28,677 --> 00:48:28,837
Good.

492
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:30,539
I see some shaking heads.

493
00:48:30,759 --> 00:48:31,659
Okay, good.

494
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:36,884
So I think obviously the policy statement, every policy should have a policy statement.

495
00:48:36,924 --> 00:48:38,325
So I think that that's fine.

496
00:48:39,826 --> 00:48:40,747
Anybody disagree?

497
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:40,847
Good.

498
00:48:43,789 --> 00:48:49,914
Just raise your hands if you want to comment on a section and as I go through it.

499
00:48:52,377 --> 00:49:00,130
I think this what is an allergy thing is great, frankly, and I don't think of it as something that's likely to change very often.

500
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:04,597
And I don't know, Jen, do you agree that that's very unlikely to change?

501
00:49:05,369 --> 00:49:07,971
Yeah, this is a pretty standard definition that's been around for a while.

502
00:49:08,592 --> 00:49:09,052
Okay, great.

503
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:15,337
I actually think the allergy triggers is wildly educational.

504
00:49:15,998 --> 00:49:23,544
I wouldn't naturally want to put it in the policy, but I just feel like is this also something that isn't likely to change?

505
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:29,677
Because these are the bigger categories of, and then what could change is what's within them, but these are the bigger categories.

506
00:49:30,617 --> 00:49:32,938
Actually, I think it's super important to have the visuals.

507
00:49:33,778 --> 00:49:33,958
Yeah.

508
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:36,558
Because it's going to increase understanding.

509
00:49:36,718 --> 00:49:38,619
I'm actually wondering if we could make those larger.

510
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:40,559
Okay.

511
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:42,480
Well, we'll worry about that later.

512
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:47,120
Anybody else have comments on just keeping the allergy trigger section?

513
00:49:49,081 --> 00:49:49,221
Great.

514
00:49:52,231 --> 00:49:54,672
I mean, I learned so much in this section right here, by the way.

515
00:49:54,692 --> 00:49:57,433
That's the point, Paul!

516
00:49:58,373 --> 00:50:03,695
I know, right?

517
00:50:03,735 --> 00:50:10,538
The education piece is something that I think was shockingly, like, when I came into the district as an allergy parent,

518
00:50:12,257 --> 00:50:23,225
I had to teach some medical staff that you can't use sanitizer to remove allergens and COVID made that way harder, that like anaphylaxis is not just a breathing emergency.

519
00:50:23,265 --> 00:50:26,367
Like there are basic things that people just do not understand.

520
00:50:26,947 --> 00:50:31,811
So some piece of the educational bit should be easily accessible and widely disseminated.

521
00:50:31,831 --> 00:50:31,891
Yep.

522
00:50:33,212 --> 00:50:41,578
So I think this anaphylaxis chart though, I would argue that that belongs in the guidance because that to me,

523
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:51,017
When people are doing their job on a regular basis, they are going to go to the guidance because that is where their immediate.

524
00:50:52,058 --> 00:50:56,783
Information need is going to be fed like, to me, that's the document that lives.

525
00:50:57,264 --> 00:50:58,345
So I think.

526
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:04,274
The top part makes sense in the policy, because I think the policy needs to have some context.

527
00:51:04,894 --> 00:51:09,538
But then, perhaps, as we get down, that top part should be repeated in the guidance.

528
00:51:09,658 --> 00:51:18,805
And then this should move to the guidance, because that is where people are going to go when they are trying to use things.

529
00:51:20,335 --> 00:51:23,636
I'm also not sure we could put graphics, by the way, in our policy service.

530
00:51:25,657 --> 00:51:26,217
Jen?

531
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:35,440
So I guess the only piece that I see that's worth keeping this, and I can take it out of graphic form and just put it into a word form, but is that this continues with the education, right?

532
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,322
Like I said, I don't think people know that these are symptoms of anaphylaxis.

533
00:51:42,813 --> 00:51:45,534
I think it's important that we keep the educational piece in here.

534
00:51:45,554 --> 00:51:53,678
If we're going to keep the other educational pieces in here, I've never given an EpiPen for a respiratory emergency.

535
00:51:53,698 --> 00:51:55,859
It's always been something else on this list.

536
00:51:56,819 --> 00:52:06,984
And I would probably guess that most non-nursing staff and non-allergy parents would not realize that a kid was having anaphylaxis with some of these symptoms.

537
00:52:08,112 --> 00:52:16,957
And I would say, again, I'm sorry, I don't want to be repetitive, but I do think tables and visuals are just going to aid in understanding and comprehension for a varied audience.

538
00:52:18,598 --> 00:52:20,039
Yeah, I mean, I like the visual.

539
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:25,041
I think the visual is super important, which is why it belongs in guidance.

540
00:52:25,381 --> 00:52:26,482
Paul, I think you're right.

541
00:52:26,502 --> 00:52:30,824
We're going to find out that none of these graphics can go in the policy document.

542
00:52:30,844 --> 00:52:33,486
I will find out.

543
00:52:34,626 --> 00:52:36,387
Because it's from straight out of 1985.

544
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:38,991
Oh, yes, it is.

545
00:52:40,272 --> 00:52:42,874
I mean, obviously some of this is going to overlap too.

546
00:52:43,074 --> 00:52:54,463
So if we took the graphics out and just put the wording, although I do love the graphics, but if it can't be in the policy, let the graphics and the wording be in the guidance where at least the wording is in the policy.

547
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:55,123
Yeah.

548
00:52:55,704 --> 00:52:57,105
Cause I think the graphic is awesome.

549
00:52:57,805 --> 00:52:58,225
I do too.

550
00:52:58,266 --> 00:52:59,006
Yeah, yeah, for sure.

551
00:52:59,687 --> 00:53:00,547
Okay.

552
00:53:03,429 --> 00:53:06,171
So considerations is working with students and caregivers.

553
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:08,550
This is more background.

554
00:53:09,291 --> 00:53:11,291
I don't have any problem with this.

555
00:53:11,511 --> 00:53:15,353
I don't know what other people think.

556
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:21,555
I think it belongs in the guidance, because I think this is going to change and evolve.

557
00:53:21,635 --> 00:53:31,318
These are the considerations right now, but we may see that something else becomes useful in the evolution of how do we work with students and caregivers.

558
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:36,791
Anybody, Jen?

559
00:53:38,752 --> 00:53:39,552
I'm a little torn.

560
00:53:39,572 --> 00:53:45,495
I mean, I agree that yes, things can change when working with some speakers, but I think this is a pretty basic about psychological wellbeing.

561
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:49,497
What's the policy?

562
00:53:49,777 --> 00:53:53,078
Like what's the policy aspect of that statement?

563
00:53:54,979 --> 00:53:56,060
Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

564
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,922
Cause I don't think there is no specific policy piece to it.

565
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:03,844
Yeah, I think that what I would like to see is some of this,

566
00:54:04,813 --> 00:54:08,717
brought into the policy statement, like the why are we here?

567
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:20,231
And I think that that's why I mean, a lot of most of our policies don't have policy statements, but I think they're important to be like, you know, none of us work in the district in the future.

568
00:54:20,351 --> 00:54:21,392
And we come to this thing.

569
00:54:21,832 --> 00:54:23,715
And we're like, well, why is this thing even here?

570
00:54:24,823 --> 00:54:29,748
Although in this particular situation, I don't imagine that allergies will be a thing of the past anytime soon.

571
00:54:32,891 --> 00:54:36,314
So, okay, so allergy bullying, absolutely we need to keep that.

572
00:54:40,838 --> 00:54:43,661
Universal life, universal precautions.

573
00:54:45,512 --> 00:54:51,918
I think that this should stay, because this would be the basis for what we're going to kind of do all the rest of the pieces and the guidance are going to be on.

574
00:54:51,938 --> 00:54:55,301
So this is talking about that we have to wash, that we can't use hand sanitizer.

575
00:54:55,321 --> 00:55:00,426
We're cleaning surfaces before and after eating so we can prevent cross-contamination.

576
00:55:00,446 --> 00:55:05,410
So this, to me, is like the meat of what we're asking everybody to do as policy.

577
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:10,995
Yeah, I'm fine.

578
00:55:11,376 --> 00:55:11,676
It's short.

579
00:55:14,008 --> 00:55:20,529
Allergy medications in the school setting, I think we want the details here to be in guidance.

580
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:31,952
I think we probably, well... Isn't there actual policy around allergy medication?

581
00:55:32,152 --> 00:55:38,033
Like students... We're doing the medication policy next, Jenny.

582
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:42,194
There's a whole new regulation around it.

583
00:55:43,866 --> 00:55:47,069
So then does it belong here at all?

584
00:55:47,089 --> 00:55:47,910
Yeah, I think we can take it out.

585
00:55:47,950 --> 00:55:49,992
Yeah, I think we take it out completely.

586
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:50,592
Okay.

587
00:55:51,373 --> 00:55:59,621
I think it should still be in the guidance because I think people need to know what the medication is specific to allergies, but we're gonna be looking at the policy for medications very soon.

588
00:55:59,641 --> 00:56:09,550
Yeah, and I think in an evolving way, the guidance could include medication

589
00:56:11,067 --> 00:56:15,772
As, like, another piece of, like, the guidance that we're providing around health services, right?

590
00:56:21,998 --> 00:56:22,078
Um.

591
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:35,685
like that blah, blah.

592
00:56:36,345 --> 00:56:37,246
I don't remember what I meant.

593
00:56:37,867 --> 00:56:54,600
So this section here, I think, like as a title, yes, and then a statement that, you know, are we working at this statement that actually says that this will exist and there'll be a reference to those things.

594
00:56:55,461 --> 00:56:58,223
And then as we develop and work through our

595
00:57:00,785 --> 00:57:07,689
collective bargaining agreements, these things can be updated to be accurate and what we expect.

596
00:57:10,471 --> 00:57:13,652
And I think this was, this is obviously super important stuff.

597
00:57:14,273 --> 00:57:17,254
I'm also wondering though, let me go back to the top of this.

598
00:57:19,616 --> 00:57:28,621
I think that we probably want to have like a section title related to PTOs that then just points to guidance also.

599
00:57:28,641 --> 00:57:30,282
I feel like the PTOs is like

600
00:57:31,828 --> 00:57:41,713
one of those ones that's like a heavy hitter for the need for the policy and, or maybe it's actually not PTOs.

601
00:57:41,893 --> 00:57:51,579
It's, what did we call those, Jenny, when we did that policy on booster organizations?

602
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:56,821
Yeah, well, I think we called them all the things that they are.

603
00:57:57,061 --> 00:57:58,242
Like it was PTOs, all the things.

604
00:58:01,002 --> 00:58:14,449
I think inserting a thing about these kinds of organizations need to go to this guidance and then having it kind of tailored to them.

605
00:58:14,469 --> 00:58:15,850
Oops.

606
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:30,237
I think the other thing when we start talking about the guidance, I think we do need to send it out again explicitly and ask for people to provide written comment.

607
00:58:31,518 --> 00:58:39,444
and ask us their questions because I think what we're going to get from them are like the practical scenarios that are on their mind.

608
00:58:39,644 --> 00:58:40,505
Like, can I do this?

609
00:58:40,545 --> 00:58:41,306
Can I not do this?

610
00:58:42,407 --> 00:58:43,367
How do I do this?

611
00:58:43,548 --> 00:58:44,769
Are you saying I don't do this?

612
00:58:45,269 --> 00:58:46,530
Or how do I do that, right?

613
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:59,140
And I think that will give us like a really like rich bank to work from in terms of like, how do we help operationalize these things so that

614
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:04,043
we see that higher success rate and that higher compliance rate.

615
00:59:05,504 --> 00:59:05,644
Yeah.

616
00:59:06,965 --> 00:59:07,566
Yeah.

617
00:59:07,646 --> 00:59:15,892
And again, that's an example where guidance is as great as all of us are in this room with our experiences.

618
00:59:17,013 --> 00:59:20,195
The day after guidance is published, somebody will be like, well, what about?

619
00:59:22,036 --> 00:59:28,181
And that can't be a whole other round of policy updates because that's a few months.

620
00:59:41,638 --> 00:59:43,519
Okay, I don't remember this section very much.

621
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:44,239
How long is it?

622
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:45,160
Oh, it's kind of long.

623
00:59:50,464 --> 00:59:53,526
So this feels like guidance to me.

624
00:59:56,628 --> 01:00:06,135
And maybe there are some like, maybe there are some policy related things that sort of like, float up out of this.

625
01:00:08,957 --> 01:00:09,197
But

626
01:00:12,441 --> 01:00:40,645
this this is like this is a procedure so to me it belongs with the guidance right like this is what we will do when this happens yeah procedures should not be in here yeah for sure uh janine can you unmute let me there you are oh shoot there we go i switched to my laptop and now i can't do

627
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:43,400
Anything my video won't go on um.

628
01:00:44,802 --> 01:00:46,703
I do want to make sure that there are some.

629
01:00:48,345 --> 01:00:55,291
Policy things that are retained in the rules and responsibilities and I know that will be doing going over that, but things like.

630
01:00:56,952 --> 01:01:02,617
There are teachers at the elementary level who are still handing out candy as prices.

631
01:01:04,457 --> 01:01:13,628
This cannot be happening, there needs to be policies about using food in the curriculum and how far in advance families need to be notified.

632
01:01:13,648 --> 01:01:19,816
If there is a reasonable reason for that thing to be happening and how their child is going to be included.

633
01:01:23,615 --> 01:01:44,081
And, and I understand that there are differences between kind of the primary and secondary education levels and kids own ability to manage their, their own allergies but I think that there, there are some pieces of the role specific thing that need to be policy and not just guidance that it's very clear that like we should not be serving food.

634
01:01:44,821 --> 01:01:58,843
And then Rhetta can speak to this too, because there's also the whatever competitive bidding, I don't remember what it's called, Rhetta, that food can't be served during school hours that's not, hasn't gone through food services, those kinds of things.

635
01:01:59,463 --> 01:02:11,866
But just things that are happening right now in our system that aren't really covered in the existing outdated policy that we wanted to make sure were covered that shouldn't just go to the guidance, but should be very clear policy.

636
01:02:13,106 --> 01:02:14,146
Yeah, I would agree with that.

637
01:02:14,748 --> 01:02:25,632
I mean, I think when my kids were in elementary school, they were always excited to take MCAS because they could bring Jolly Ranchers to school.

638
01:02:26,872 --> 01:02:29,814
And I was like, I don't know why you're excited about this.

639
01:02:30,214 --> 01:02:32,034
You never, ever eat Jolly Ranchers.

640
01:02:32,435 --> 01:02:34,375
But OK.

641
01:02:34,395 --> 01:02:37,897
And I guess the other question is,

642
01:02:39,635 --> 01:02:44,879
That's maybe an example of where you would just want to say no to that thing.

643
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:59,511
But given that every classroom, especially at the elementary level, is potentially going to have something different going on, what are the things that we're like, no, just no, completely?

644
01:02:59,691 --> 01:03:05,636
And what are the things that are like, there are a set of steps that you go through to understand what

645
01:03:07,195 --> 01:03:16,803
the parameters in your room are, I don't know what they are, but maybe you have a room where there are no allergies at all.

646
01:03:17,243 --> 01:03:18,104
Maybe that's true.

647
01:03:18,384 --> 01:03:24,249
And does that change how you operate in that room versus everybody else?

648
01:03:24,349 --> 01:03:30,955
And I'm not saying you should or shouldn't do something different, but I'm just saying that those are the kinds of things where

649
01:03:32,345 --> 01:03:42,772
We just want to I think we want to be thoughtful about what we're asking people to do to respond to, like, the facts that are sort of in their dynamic.

650
01:03:46,555 --> 01:03:52,699
Yeah, I just want I don't think a teacher should be giving out candy.

651
01:03:53,278 --> 01:03:59,022
to kids ever, and I feel like there is a policy somewhere that relates to this.

652
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:17,295
I think it's a different story if a teacher says, oh, MCAS, you can bring in candy, or I know sometimes kids are allowed to bring in gum, and if they bring it in for themselves and are allowed to consume it, that's very different than someone giving it to them when a parent is unaware.

653
01:04:17,316 --> 01:04:17,976
Yeah.

654
01:04:21,001 --> 01:04:26,882
I, and I think even if, whether or not the kids have allergies in the classroom, that doesn't change that.

655
01:04:27,002 --> 01:04:30,603
There are just some things that should be a policy and shouldn't be done.

656
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:36,965
And like I said, I believe that that was already written somewhere, but I don't know in what policy, maybe competitive foods.

657
01:04:38,025 --> 01:04:41,346
I mean, it certainly doesn't meet the nutrition standards of competitive foods.

658
01:04:41,426 --> 01:04:44,506
So from that standpoint, it doesn't.

659
01:04:44,646 --> 01:04:46,207
But when you say no candy, like,

660
01:04:48,113 --> 01:04:49,795
we have to be clear about what we mean by that.

661
01:04:49,855 --> 01:04:55,739
Like we may not hand out candy versus like you may never bring candy into the classroom.

662
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:56,800
Those are two different things.

663
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:57,060
Right.

664
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:09,049
So that I think that's a good example of like what are we like specifically saying you can do and you can't do so that the policy can be clear about that.

665
01:05:09,149 --> 01:05:11,070
Like teachers may not hand out candy.

666
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:11,931
That's a policy.

667
01:05:12,311 --> 01:05:12,552
Fine.

668
01:05:12,912 --> 01:05:13,072
Good.

669
01:05:14,308 --> 01:05:16,869
moving on from that, but what does that mean?

670
01:05:17,149 --> 01:05:18,769
You know, what are the other layers there?

671
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:21,550
Jen, did you want to say something?

672
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:22,950
Because I can go after you.

673
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:23,911
Yeah, sure.

674
01:05:24,331 --> 01:05:32,433
So one, I think the previous policy, or I don't know if it was ever approved by the school committee, but the policy that we're working on from 2007 says no outside food in the classroom.

675
01:05:32,453 --> 01:05:35,534
We know that that's no longer really possible to enforce.

676
01:05:35,554 --> 01:05:40,255
And I want to echo Rhetta that I think it needs to be more that we are not giving students food.

677
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:50,224
that we can have special celebrations where we're having a movie day and you can bring your own special snack or it's MCAS and you want to bring a piece of gum to chew after or Jolly Ranchers or whatnot.

678
01:05:50,624 --> 01:05:55,949
I think we have to make it clear that there's no sharing or providing of food by our staff for students.

679
01:05:57,010 --> 01:06:01,893
The other thing I wanted to say is I think we can never assume there's no allergies in a classroom.

680
01:06:02,413 --> 01:06:07,156
There have been more EpiPens given for accidental exposure to unknown allergies.

681
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:13,740
And actually, especially at the secondary level, there has actually been evidence and data that shows that there are more EpiPens given.

682
01:06:14,180 --> 01:06:21,905
at the secondary level in high school for accidental exposure than at the lower level, because we're just so much more careful about it at the elementary level.

683
01:06:22,385 --> 01:06:26,008
And then we get this sort of laissez-faire at the secondary, like, oh, kids know their allergies.

684
01:06:26,028 --> 01:06:26,888
They're going to tell us.

685
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:28,449
And that's not what's happening.

686
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:32,572
So I just want to be very careful to say that, like, oh, you have no allergies in your room.

687
01:06:32,592 --> 01:06:33,413
You don't have to worry about that.

688
01:06:33,673 --> 01:06:39,837
Everybody should be implementing the same policy across the board, whether or not you know that students in your class have allergies.

689
01:06:40,417 --> 01:06:50,968
And I think that's very important that when we're looking at this and stating what is policy, that we make sure that it's clear across the board that no matter what's in your classroom, that this is an expectation.

690
01:06:51,329 --> 01:06:52,290
And it's not just food.

691
01:06:52,470 --> 01:06:56,134
So, you know, kids with gluten can't do paper mache.

692
01:06:57,295 --> 01:06:59,958
There's other pieces to this that don't include food.

693
01:07:03,284 --> 01:07:04,565
Oh my gosh, paper mache.

694
01:07:05,306 --> 01:07:06,827
Sorry, that just hit me.

695
01:07:06,907 --> 01:07:08,589
Or the egg drop, the science egg drop.

696
01:07:08,869 --> 01:07:11,392
Every time they say they're going to do the egg drop, my head like explodes.

697
01:07:11,792 --> 01:07:11,992
So much.

698
01:07:12,012 --> 01:07:13,013
You know how many kids have egg drops?

699
01:07:13,033 --> 01:07:13,173
Geez.

700
01:07:13,193 --> 01:07:14,635
Sorry, I hate all the rules.

701
01:07:19,064 --> 01:07:24,785
Nicole, member Brantley, you said that you were a para and they were like always looking at like allergens and stuff.

702
01:07:24,905 --> 01:07:32,187
I know students who have been handed allergen candies by special education classes in this district.

703
01:07:32,327 --> 01:07:34,647
Like it's not equally implemented.

704
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:37,388
Oh, that might very well be the case.

705
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:39,488
I'm just saying what I experienced in my classroom.

706
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:42,969
Yeah, no, I just wanted to make sure that everybody knew that that's like, great.

707
01:07:43,089 --> 01:07:45,009
I'm so glad that that was happening in your classroom.

708
01:07:45,029 --> 01:07:47,090
That's not what's happening everywhere.

709
01:07:48,002 --> 01:08:06,521
Yeah, and even to Jen's point too, just one sec, Dr. Gosey, like I remember even being as a para and they should be, you know, when we did have like a movie day before holiday break or winter break, you know, we would have like the popcorn time, you know, popcorn day, whatever, but we would talk

710
01:08:07,081 --> 01:08:17,806
to each family, we would have them sign a little something, you know, and that was always approved by the principal, you know, but I'm not sure we went by any specific policy either.

711
01:08:17,967 --> 01:08:26,691
So, you know, I think that we do have to make sure that we're following something here, you know, that everybody's gonna do universally.

712
01:08:27,111 --> 01:08:30,133
Now, if they're following through with it, that's another story, you know what I mean, but.

713
01:08:32,914 --> 01:08:34,395
And I agree to all of the above.

714
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:40,879
I think we have to be aligned, there has to be something we're all following so that everybody is doing the same thing.

715
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:49,810
I agree with Karen's chat comments about it is, you know, on us to be modeling those expectations.

716
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:55,077
I also just want to put two points though, is that I do think that

717
01:08:56,353 --> 01:09:10,704
When we're just making a blanket statement about teachers aren't doing this and students shouldn't have candy, there does though need to be some sort of asterisk because there are students for medical reasons that have to receive candy.

718
01:09:10,724 --> 01:09:16,469
I would have to look a little bit more into Shanine's comment about

719
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:25,773
special education, then this is not the platform to have that conversation, but there are some students where that is part of their IEP.

720
01:09:26,073 --> 01:09:43,082
I'm not saying what kinds it can be, but I'm just saying there has to be some sort of asterisk around, you know, with the exception of a 504, a health plan, an IEP, and then there is that flip side.

721
01:09:43,122 --> 01:09:45,043
I understand what we're talking about with MCAS,

722
01:09:46,735 --> 01:09:58,627
and making it like from home so that there's some parental oversight and permission, but that's also not the most equitable way to go about it.

723
01:09:58,707 --> 01:10:05,994
So I would rather have a conversation that's different around what that might look like because then you're

724
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:17,709
you're not having all students that are gonna come to class with like a special reward or treat or, you know, to my knowledge, MCAS was lifesavers.

725
01:10:18,349 --> 01:10:30,631
It was not Jolly Ranchers and not candy, but I just wanna not close the door to that completely because then we're gonna get into an equity issue.

726
01:10:32,112 --> 01:10:33,752
Sounds like you think we should stop MCAS.

727
01:10:38,598 --> 01:10:42,061
Well, I think that's like a great example of like this.

728
01:10:44,863 --> 01:10:53,110
If you want to do it really well, it's much more complicated than just saying no to things because maybe the answer is.

729
01:10:53,130 --> 01:11:01,256
We, as a district are going to provide X. And we are asking for your permission.

730
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:05,068
for your kid to have this thing.

731
01:11:05,568 --> 01:11:17,539
I don't know, but I think that's a great example of like, I don't wanna like, you know, sort of throw it all out with the best of intentions.

732
01:11:17,659 --> 01:11:26,367
And then we actually are creating another problem that has to be solved from an equity perspective, right?

733
01:11:28,107 --> 01:11:30,528
Yeah, I'll let you speak into second, Jen.

734
01:11:30,548 --> 01:11:36,149
But there's that alternative to site-wide restrictions section that I think is really important.

735
01:11:36,469 --> 01:11:51,554
And I'm glad to see that in there, that if we just come out and say, there shall be no candy in Medford Public Schools, we all need to get a grip, because that's just not

736
01:11:53,634 --> 01:11:56,035
at least it's just never going to happen.

737
01:11:57,215 --> 01:12:07,357
So, and I think that's part of the other issue with policy versus guidance is both policy and guidance don't need anything if it's not implemented.

738
01:12:07,497 --> 01:12:16,680
And I, the thing that I like about policy over guidance is that it outlives the employees.

739
01:12:19,258 --> 01:12:36,774
And that guidance should outlive the employees too, but you know, we'll do a new website someday and all the pages won't get converted and you know, things vanish and it's a Google Doc and it was attached to Rob's account and Rob retires and suddenly all those Google Docs disappear.

740
01:12:36,874 --> 01:12:44,221
It's like the technical reasons for which things that are digital vanish is staggering.

741
01:12:45,262 --> 01:12:49,905
And at least our policies do stick around.

742
01:12:50,925 --> 01:12:58,009
But again, we have hundreds of policies that have stuck around, which cannot, aren't even legal anymore.

743
01:12:58,069 --> 01:13:00,790
Like they're just nobody who should be following some of those.

744
01:13:01,971 --> 01:13:04,052
And my camera is not happy right now.

745
01:13:04,532 --> 01:13:07,934
But anyways, Jen, did you want to say something?

746
01:13:10,743 --> 01:13:18,087
We have 15 minutes, so I want us to get through the list of sections to get looked at again.

747
01:13:18,107 --> 01:13:23,470
Let me go back to where I was.

748
01:13:35,738 --> 01:13:36,398
responding.

749
01:13:37,599 --> 01:13:40,179
That to me feels very much like something.

750
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:43,200
We're going to have changes in structures.

751
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:48,461
We'll have some horrible economic situation and we'll start sharing principles.

752
01:13:48,961 --> 01:13:50,702
All kinds of horrible things can happen.

753
01:13:50,842 --> 01:13:51,802
That happened in Medford.

754
01:13:51,822 --> 01:13:54,263
We used to have principles covering more than one building.

755
01:13:55,183 --> 01:14:04,367
Um, which I can't fathom how that was operationalized, but anyways, um, and we didn't even have assistant principals at all the schools when I started.

756
01:14:04,727 --> 01:14:20,954
So, um, these are all things that I think are, are subject to need to really be robust and need to change as the, as things change on the ground.

757
01:14:24,167 --> 01:14:27,472
The glossary 100% think that needs to stay here.

758
01:14:28,634 --> 01:14:29,135
There was.

759
01:14:32,752 --> 01:14:58,017
So we didn't have really the IT infrastructure, and I'm not really sure how much we have now, but I think I wrote a policy that was adopted that said we would actually have a master glossary website, just a URL, and that the committee through our policy work would be just adding them on so that 504 plans as defined here,

760
01:14:59,168 --> 01:15:04,752
Anybody want to take bets as to whether it's defined in 15 other policies and has a different definition?

761
01:15:06,594 --> 01:15:07,374
I mean, there's no point.

762
01:15:07,555 --> 01:15:14,480
We know that these definitions are repeated all over the place and they're not necessarily in agreement.

763
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:22,346
And sometimes it doesn't matter if they're not in agreement, you know, caregivers, some will say parents and guardians, like some of that stuff is irrelevant.

764
01:15:22,746 --> 01:15:23,967
But when it does matter,

765
01:15:24,946 --> 01:15:26,967
is, I think, when it really is a problem.

766
01:15:27,887 --> 01:15:31,828
I assume the American Academy of Pediatrics isn't going to change their name soon.

767
01:15:32,008 --> 01:15:38,490
But Allergy and Anaphylaxis Emergency Plan could get a nice new, shorter, friendlier name in the future.

768
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:41,811
And anyways, I don't need to keep explaining myself.

769
01:15:42,251 --> 01:15:52,954
So hopefully, we can get an actual glossary web page, and we can get all the terms that we are using in the district onto one dictionary, and then just point to that.

770
01:15:55,845 --> 01:15:58,767
But for now, I actually think they should stay here until we have that.

771
01:16:01,669 --> 01:16:02,550
Anybody disagree?

772
01:16:07,413 --> 01:16:08,174
Alternatives.

773
01:16:09,195 --> 01:16:10,656
I actually like this section.

774
01:16:10,676 --> 01:16:14,939
Until I read it, I was like, oh, really?

775
01:16:18,061 --> 01:16:19,242
Maybe not all of the pieces.

776
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:38,259
These strategies to me, like, in general, these strategies belong in guidance, I think, but again, there may be some things that we want to frame in the policy around.

777
01:16:39,341 --> 01:16:42,984
Like, when we're going to use site wide restrictions.

778
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:53,543
I don't know, whatever those might be, and sort of point to the guidance for that evolving list, because I think this is going to change.

779
01:16:53,583 --> 01:17:11,549
Like, when we get a new high school and we don't have CAF 1, CAF 2, and CAF 3 anymore, like, I don't know, maybe that changes how operationally these things can be executed, or when the kitchen is completely different, or we change how we deliver food to the schools, whatever it is.

780
01:17:13,650 --> 01:17:14,370
All of those things.

781
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,331
you know, sort of need to be updated and maintained.

782
01:17:17,591 --> 01:17:33,878
So to me, they belong in guidance, but I could see that there might be some site-wide restrictions, like schools may not have allergy tables in their cafeterias, right?

783
01:17:33,938 --> 01:17:35,899
Like, maybe that's a site-wide restriction.

784
01:17:35,939 --> 01:17:40,301
Like, we're going to do that, we're going to do it in every building, and that's the end of it.

785
01:17:40,981 --> 01:17:44,803
So there probably are some things that belong in policy from these lists.

786
01:17:46,315 --> 01:17:48,237
Yeah, that that that makes sense to me, I think.

787
01:17:50,018 --> 01:17:52,460
Yeah, I don't think I'm I'm going to take chunks.

788
01:17:53,141 --> 01:17:55,183
I'm going to item by item go.

789
01:17:55,363 --> 01:17:57,305
Yeah, this is policy like this.

790
01:17:57,425 --> 01:17:59,467
This is this isn't policy.

791
01:17:59,507 --> 01:18:03,170
This is background whether or not it stays or not.

792
01:18:04,011 --> 01:18:05,432
Will the.

793
01:18:06,012 --> 01:18:07,874
But like the policy statement might be.

794
01:18:07,894 --> 01:18:12,098
You know, district wide restrictions.

795
01:18:16,161 --> 01:18:19,344
Well, I don't know, but we can figure out where.

796
01:18:19,564 --> 01:18:22,527
We don't want to lose it because it's super important information, I think.

797
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:22,968
Yeah.

798
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:49,230
I just want to say I know we've been kind of using allergy tables a shorthand for like a policy that might stick but the policy doesn't actually say we shouldn't ever have allergy tables it says we should be working in partnership around a particular like set of needs to decide if that's relevant for like so like a peanut free table is helpful for a particular group of kids.

799
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:54,692
But if my peanut allergic kid goes and sits at the peanut table and somebody has hummus he's going to have a reaction to that.

800
01:18:55,292 --> 01:19:03,896
So they're not as helpful as we want them to be but this policy doesn't say we shouldn't have them but I think that potentially under the cafeteria strategies.

801
01:19:06,292 --> 01:19:23,216
The policy, instead of just the recommendation or the guidance, might be that first indented one where it says implementing allergy tables can be complex, but the need for designated tables will be determined for each individual school in consultation with these other parties.

802
01:19:23,276 --> 01:19:24,636
That could be the policy statement.

803
01:19:26,216 --> 01:19:26,496
OK.

804
01:19:26,937 --> 01:19:28,077
Who gets to decide?

805
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:30,577
I think that, to me, has to be clear.

806
01:19:30,617 --> 01:19:30,737
Yeah.

807
01:19:34,036 --> 01:19:36,257
But isn't that like, I think I can do that.

808
01:19:36,277 --> 01:19:44,541
But I guess what seems to have happened is that each individual building has decided without talking to central admin.

809
01:19:45,687 --> 01:19:47,228
you just have different policies.

810
01:19:48,528 --> 01:20:01,952
I know the Missittook is doing a very different thing than the Roberts, and I don't know what the Brooks and McGlynn are doing, but it seems like they've just been able to kind of make their own decisions on style rather than on best practice.

811
01:20:02,032 --> 01:20:11,115
And so I think the communication with Central, with health services and the food services director would be part of the policy is that we make this decision together.

812
01:20:11,615 --> 01:20:14,856
And so if there is going to be a building difference that Central should know about that.

813
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:20,149
I also think we say in collaboration with caregivers there too, because.

814
01:20:21,237 --> 01:20:28,842
So I think you always have to plan for, in nursing we always are like planning for the unexpected, planning for the worst possible thing, right?

815
01:20:29,302 --> 01:20:47,233
And so we need to be able to say, we're gonna do this in conjunction with caregivers and support from the central office, because it may be that for one particular child who has multiple allergies, they need a specific setup versus at another school where there's a child that really only has this one thing we're worried about.

816
01:20:47,574 --> 01:20:49,155
And so what are we doing for that one child?

817
01:20:50,620 --> 01:21:04,407
I think it's hard to say we can have – we always go back to the peanut table because those have become kind of a thing of the past because when we would say, oh, we're going to have a peanut table or a peanut-free table, those kids were then being excluded from the rest of their group, right?

818
01:21:04,447 --> 01:21:10,970
Because if we're saying, oh, only the kids who are peanut-free have to sit here, then we're not being inclusive.

819
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:16,272
Whereas before saying, oh, the kids who bring peanuts can sit here, because now we're saying, well, we've made a choice.

820
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:17,032
We're going to bring peanuts.

821
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:18,012
We're going to sit at this table.

822
01:21:18,633 --> 01:21:21,133
Though I go back and forth about those two.

823
01:21:21,694 --> 01:21:33,058
But I think we just, so, but what I wanted to say before I have Shanine said that was, I think that what we can do is when we look at that universal section up near the top, we can pull out some of these things to be in that sort of like universal section.

824
01:21:33,098 --> 01:21:35,859
Like this is something that everybody should be doing.

825
01:21:36,119 --> 01:21:38,940
We can, you know, rename it that it's not universal precautions, but.

826
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:49,923
I will totally admit that you have just shocked me by saying we're not going to have the same thing in every cafeteria.

827
01:21:50,043 --> 01:21:55,266
I am a little bit flabbergasted because I thought that's where we were going.

828
01:21:55,826 --> 01:22:05,052
But are you saying, though, that every school is required to have a cafeteria operations plan?

829
01:22:06,177 --> 01:22:16,681
that takes into account what has to happen in their cafeteria and that that cafeteria operations plan has to be signed off by certain people.

830
01:22:16,781 --> 01:22:26,225
Is that the policy that, because I feel like what you've just said is it depends and it can be different, but I feel like I also heard us say it's different and there's no reason why.

831
01:22:26,405 --> 01:22:32,487
So I'm trying to reconcile those things into something that is actually like actionable.

832
01:22:33,387 --> 01:22:38,914
Yeah, so I think what we're looking at here, and I think obviously we spent a lot of this time talking about we want to make sure that all classrooms are doing certain things.

833
01:22:39,274 --> 01:22:43,920
So we're looking at now the difference of the cafeteria versus the classrooms is the cafeteria is where food has to happen, right?

834
01:22:44,180 --> 01:22:45,702
This is where kids eat.

835
01:22:46,343 --> 01:22:48,806
We have to look at what are our possible different options.

836
01:22:49,006 --> 01:22:49,747
So I do agree.

837
01:22:50,207 --> 01:22:52,190
kind of what you're saying with that cafeteria operations plan.

838
01:22:52,210 --> 01:23:04,386
Yes, we do have to have, in some way, what should the cafeteria staff, what should food services and health services be collaborating with the principal on to say, this is what this cafeteria has to look like based on our student population.

839
01:23:05,263 --> 01:23:12,649
So this is like the one time where there is gonna be a little bit of wiggle room because Johnny at this school is allergic to fava beans and that's gonna be an issue.

840
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:16,393
This kid at this school is allergic to something else and that's gonna be an issue.

841
01:23:16,413 --> 01:23:23,318
So we have to, the cafeteria is where there has to be a little bit more collaboration to say we might have to do things differently in different schools.

842
01:23:23,338 --> 01:23:30,204
But I think what we're trying to say is we don't want it to be that there's this sort of specific table where only these kids can sit.

843
01:23:30,244 --> 01:23:33,067
We really need to have a conversation around that and make a plan.

844
01:23:34,365 --> 01:23:37,907
And it's about the safety, right?

845
01:23:38,067 --> 01:23:42,429
But also about the social emotional well-being inclusion part.

846
01:23:43,229 --> 01:23:47,091
So it is all individualized, just like Jen said.

847
01:23:47,611 --> 01:23:58,316
It's not just about peanuts or nuts and providing that child with a safe, a safe spot while they're eating their food.

848
01:24:02,648 --> 01:24:03,188
And I can't.

849
01:24:03,909 --> 01:24:04,509
Hi, Karen.

850
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:07,551
And I think.

851
01:24:11,433 --> 01:24:25,620
What I foresee in a cafeteria is all of those things are happening everywhere all at once at all times in the cafeteria, like the social, emotional needs, the, the allergies, the not allergies.

852
01:24:26,198 --> 01:24:28,000
All of that is happening at the same time.

853
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:36,366
So I think it's like, I appreciate the desire for us to say we have to like do what the kids need us to do.

854
01:24:37,067 --> 01:24:47,736
But I think on a practical level, the cafeteria is gonna have kids that need us to do each and every single one of those things at the same time, which are potentially in conflict, right?

855
01:24:48,196 --> 01:24:52,940
So how do we frame the policy so that

856
01:24:56,226 --> 01:25:00,489
I think what we're trying to do is have some consistency.

857
01:25:00,509 --> 01:25:09,995
So how do we frame the rules, the policy, so that we get consistency?

858
01:25:10,015 --> 01:25:21,342
And if I was a building principal, I would be like, I thought I had to have allergen tables.

859
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:22,583
I thought I had to have

860
01:25:22,996 --> 01:25:24,897
Tables where people with peanuts go.

861
01:25:25,577 --> 01:25:30,239
I used to have tables where kids without peanuts went, and I was told that was bad.

862
01:25:30,279 --> 01:25:31,120
So we switched to this.

863
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,760
And now you're saying to switch back.

864
01:25:32,881 --> 01:25:35,382
I think that's really hard to execute on.

865
01:25:35,442 --> 01:25:51,609
So that's, and I don't have the answers necessarily, but I think we have to come up with a framework for people so that they can put together plans that are consistent in some way.

866
01:25:54,541 --> 01:25:57,063
Paul, can you bring back up the cafeteria strategies?

867
01:25:57,083 --> 01:26:02,648
Because I think that we tried to frame it in that way in what we wrote.

868
01:26:08,298 --> 01:26:20,065
And again, I think that, yes, again, we have to parse out here what's policy and what's just guidance, but really looking at that the basic piece here is that we're fostering an inclusive environment, right?

869
01:26:20,105 --> 01:26:21,466
So how do we do that?

870
01:26:21,626 --> 01:26:24,027
That's gonna maybe look a little different in each place.

871
01:26:24,988 --> 01:26:32,953
And some of you may be way better at that language than I am, but just looking at what does that language actually look like when it comes to policy?

872
01:26:34,714 --> 01:26:36,575
Yeah, we can work on that.

873
01:26:37,952 --> 01:26:43,414
Is best practice then that everything is individualized?

874
01:26:43,795 --> 01:26:53,359
I guess my only piece, and I see where this would require setting up a communication structure so that

875
01:26:54,834 --> 01:27:01,317
all principals are following this, working, we have to be very clear about who we're working with and how we're creating this plan.

876
01:27:01,737 --> 01:27:06,260
Because the things that concern me are like the, especially like that K1 lunch.

877
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:11,622
So we're there, and Shanine mentioned it, because there's so many allergies.

878
01:27:11,742 --> 01:27:22,288
So just to say that a plan for one student, I don't know if we can always control what that student's peers are bringing in for lunch.

879
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:28,992
I know that the classroom environments are very much controlled.

880
01:27:29,912 --> 01:27:39,255
And so there's lots of classrooms around the district that have, it may be a sesame free classroom, it may be a nut free classroom.

881
01:27:39,876 --> 01:27:42,757
And the cafeteria has been usually like a little bit,

882
01:27:45,240 --> 01:28:06,549
That has somewhat been a space where maybe families that are planning for their own children's lunch, they may know that you can't have this for snack because that happens in the classroom, but your child may be able to eat this because it's in the cafeteria.

883
01:28:07,069 --> 01:28:08,150
So I just want to make sure

884
01:28:09,270 --> 01:28:16,715
I know what is best practice for when we are trying to work around cafeteria planning.

885
01:28:17,115 --> 01:28:17,715
Does that make sense?

886
01:28:18,256 --> 01:28:18,416
Yeah.

887
01:28:18,496 --> 01:28:21,398
And I think best practice is that we have to individualize to an extent.

888
01:28:22,138 --> 01:28:25,000
And this is a little bit outside of policy, so I don't want to talk about it too much.

889
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,342
But one of the things that we have been trying to do from health services

890
01:28:28,842 --> 01:28:31,463
is this Be a Pal education program with students as well.

891
01:28:31,523 --> 01:28:38,966
So that students are aware of food allergies, that they're getting more education about their peers, what could be happening in the cafeteria, what could be happening in the classroom.

892
01:28:39,406 --> 01:28:49,771
And so when we're looking at sort of what's going to be policy, I think on the procedure side, we have to look at bringing that Be a Pal program in as well, which has gone really well at the Mr. Tuck, the Roberts is implementing it this year.

893
01:28:49,791 --> 01:28:52,792
And, you know, just that there's more education all around.

894
01:28:52,852 --> 01:28:54,973
It's not just about the adults, it's about the students as well.

895
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:00,512
Okay, we are here.

896
01:29:00,812 --> 01:29:01,253
We're here.

897
01:29:01,353 --> 01:29:02,054
We're at time.

898
01:29:02,074 --> 01:29:04,237
We should just do this last section here.

899
01:29:05,438 --> 01:29:06,279
Thoughts on this section here.

900
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:31,029
I don't remember where it says this, but since we experienced this, it needs to be policy that school personnel cannot recommend that a child should not have a 504 for this, that they can take care of it with their medical plan.

901
01:29:34,131 --> 01:29:42,396
Yeah, I think we just have to be clear that the medical plan that is for emergencies or for use in the Health Services Department is not the same as a 504.

902
01:29:43,645 --> 01:29:44,625
that's enforceable.

903
01:29:45,866 --> 01:29:52,688
And so unfortunately, we've had this happen on many occasions where parents have been told, oh, you don't need a 504 because you have a health care plan.

904
01:29:52,728 --> 01:30:00,912
So I think I do agree that I think some of this is policy and we can look at this was from the FAM's recommendation from the food allergy research.

905
01:30:02,518 --> 01:30:04,359
I think is where this came from, Shanine, right?

906
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:05,779
I think this was in the FAMS guidance.

907
01:30:06,439 --> 01:30:08,600
And the FAMS guidance was over 30 pages.

908
01:30:08,640 --> 01:30:11,061
So, you know, we got it a little bit shorter when we came here.

909
01:30:12,562 --> 01:30:14,522
But I think that's where exactly where this came from.

910
01:30:15,203 --> 01:30:29,468
Well, that goes back to the education part though, because you can have an individualized healthcare plan as part of a 504 plan, but we can work on the educational part for our staff.

911
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:49,637
I do think there is a policy element to this, which is, what is our policy about how we have families bring these things to us?

912
01:30:50,037 --> 01:30:54,279
I'm not being very clear because my brain is just about cooked for today.

913
01:30:56,633 --> 01:31:08,118
There should be something in the policy that can go in handbooks that says, if your child has a food allergy, here's the pathway for you.

914
01:31:10,699 --> 01:31:14,320
You have options, whatever those options might be.

915
01:31:14,481 --> 01:31:15,561
It might be a medical plan.

916
01:31:15,581 --> 01:31:17,922
It might be a 504, whatever those things are.

917
01:31:17,942 --> 01:31:20,203
And how do I begin to do?

918
01:31:21,203 --> 01:31:22,804
I'm sending my kid to school.

919
01:31:23,524 --> 01:31:24,965
I know they have a life-threatening allergy.

920
01:31:26,103 --> 01:31:26,803
Who do I call?

921
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:27,724
What do I do?

922
01:31:28,144 --> 01:31:28,844
How does it work?

923
01:31:29,484 --> 01:31:42,188
There's a piece of this education that has to be available to families on how to engage with us so that plans can be put in place expeditiously if needed.

924
01:31:42,248 --> 01:31:51,451
Like you said, Jen, I was not a child when I learned I had a life-threatening allergy because I didn't eat any fish or shellfish at all.

925
01:31:52,211 --> 01:31:54,312
And until I did, I had no idea.

926
01:31:55,237 --> 01:31:59,140
And so you do learn about allergies and they change over time, right?

927
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:04,523
So, um, how, where do we put the like reference?

928
01:32:04,923 --> 01:32:11,728
So certainly that maybe the policy statement is the district will maintain a page, a webpage that talks about how to do this.

929
01:32:12,508 --> 01:32:23,275
Um, but there, there, it does seem to me to like, if it lives in policy, it's fine, but like parents don't go to the policy handbook to,

930
01:32:24,742 --> 01:32:26,144
serve these kinds of needs.

931
01:32:26,224 --> 01:32:41,199
So maybe the policy is that there is a mechanism to do this within expedited turnaround time or something like that versus trying to net that out in the policy document.

932
01:32:41,219 --> 01:32:41,259
OK.

933
01:32:54,694 --> 01:33:14,317
Um, really quickly, this is not, um, because Paul, you might not be aware in your, um, looking at the policies that, um, and I know Jen is on top of this as well, but there's currently legislation going through, um, at the state level that would broaden the use and, um, kind of

934
01:33:16,232 --> 01:33:25,936
the use and storage of epinephrine so that like police officers are able to have it and all these other people are able to have access that restaurants can have stock epinephrine.

935
01:33:25,957 --> 01:33:44,565
So those laws also can help inform our policy as they are passed and they're likely to pass, but they're very, very exciting since we know that so many people who do have a reaction are, was it like 10% or 25%, Jen, of people who have a reaction inside a school are not known

936
01:33:45,766 --> 01:33:51,832
And sometimes it's the mailman who has a sort of anaphylactic reaction in the school when he's dropping something off.

937
01:33:52,893 --> 01:33:58,618
Yeah, I think, though, just to piggyback on that, that will become part of our medication policy and not necessarily this policy.

938
01:33:59,019 --> 01:33:59,239
OK.

939
01:34:00,260 --> 01:34:00,440
Yeah.

940
01:34:01,655 --> 01:34:14,184
And as soon as that comes down, anything we need, as soon as we can get this completed before this law is changed, I would really be annoyed if they happen like the week before we approve it.

941
01:34:16,105 --> 01:34:19,007
So I'm going to make

942
01:34:20,462 --> 01:34:30,507
the motion to have the administration in collaboration with Chair Rousseau, myself, rework the policy proposal to move appropriate sections to guidance.

943
01:34:31,448 --> 01:34:35,950
Does that sound OK?

944
01:34:36,930 --> 01:34:37,571
That's the next step.

945
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:40,552
Is there a second?

946
01:34:41,653 --> 01:34:41,973
Second.

947
01:34:42,893 --> 01:34:43,213
Sorry.

948
01:34:44,754 --> 01:34:46,295
I was like, yeah, let's do that.

949
01:34:47,656 --> 01:34:47,976
Second.

950
01:34:48,876 --> 01:34:48,996
OK.

951
01:34:52,805 --> 01:34:53,485
Member Brandly.

952
01:34:56,566 --> 01:34:57,126
Did we lose?

953
01:34:57,847 --> 01:34:58,687
Yes, I'm here.

954
01:34:59,167 --> 01:34:59,547
Oh, you are.

955
01:34:59,687 --> 01:34:59,887
Sorry.

956
01:35:00,167 --> 01:35:00,308
Good.

957
01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:02,488
Because I'm still sharing, which I should stop.

958
01:35:02,928 --> 01:35:03,709
I can't see everybody.

959
01:35:03,789 --> 01:35:04,249
Okay, great.

960
01:35:04,309 --> 01:35:05,209
Thank you.

961
01:35:05,949 --> 01:35:07,390
Member Rousseau, yes.

962
01:35:07,770 --> 01:35:08,930
And Member Graham.

963
01:35:09,471 --> 01:35:09,651
Yes.

964
01:35:10,911 --> 01:35:11,151
All right.

965
01:35:11,771 --> 01:35:13,212
So I think we have a good

966
01:35:14,526 --> 01:35:18,869
set up next steps with all the notes that I took in the document.

967
01:35:19,630 --> 01:35:40,306
I'm going to also have to, I'll get a hold of Will to have him set up a page, sort of as a landing page for guidance, unless we already have one, so that we can put that right into the actual policy instead of saying we'll get to it in the future, which I don't know about you, but I'm all, but I'm pretty busy.

968
01:35:40,326 --> 01:35:42,427
So let's get it done.

969
01:35:43,768 --> 01:35:49,430
And then obviously after we've reworked this, I'll schedule another one of these meetings.

970
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:52,731
And if we can cross our fingers, it'll be the last meeting.

971
01:35:53,552 --> 01:35:57,573
Not that I don't enjoy this, but we actually have to pass something.

972
01:35:59,134 --> 01:36:02,135
So any other final words from anybody?

973
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,136
Is there a motion to adjourn?

974
01:36:06,156 --> 01:36:08,757
I'd like a motion to adjourn.

975
01:36:17,385 --> 01:36:18,065
Member Branley?

976
01:36:18,686 --> 01:36:18,906
Yes.

977
01:36:19,686 --> 01:36:20,246
Member Graham?

978
01:36:20,907 --> 01:36:21,107
Yes.

979
01:36:21,887 --> 01:36:22,627
Member Rousseau?

980
01:36:23,087 --> 01:36:23,428
Yes.

981
01:36:24,188 --> 01:36:26,889
I really appreciate this great conversation, everyone.

982
01:36:26,909 --> 01:36:30,611
I do think we're getting, we are getting somewhere.

983
01:36:30,631 --> 01:36:40,835
I know that it's been a very long time coming and Shanine is, I appreciate the pokes to be like, what are we talking about?

984
01:36:40,935 --> 01:36:45,177
And I, and you know, cause everything's always, there's so much always in our faces.

985
01:36:45,197 --> 01:36:45,897
It's fluid, yeah.

986
01:36:47,345 --> 01:36:52,339
It's really hard to stay focused too long on one thing before something else grabs our focus.

987
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:53,803
So I appreciate it.

988
01:36:53,903 --> 01:36:55,327
Everybody have a wonderful evening.

989
01:36:55,388 --> 01:36:56,210
This meeting is adjourned.
