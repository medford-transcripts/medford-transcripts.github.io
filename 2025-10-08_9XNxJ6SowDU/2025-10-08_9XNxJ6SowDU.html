    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=0.451s">Please</a>  be advised that on October 7th, 2025 at 4.30 PM, there will be a rules and policies subcommittee meeting held through, excuse me, remote participation via Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=11.275s">This</a>  meeting is being recorded. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=14.53s">The</a>  meeting can be viewed live on Medford Public Schools YouTube channel through Medford Community Media on your local cable channel, Comcast 9, 8, or 22, Verizon 43, 45, and 47. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=26.456s">Since</a>  the meeting will be held remotely, participants can log or call in by using the following link or number. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=37.139s">There's</a>  no phone number listed, but if you are actually listening to this, then you probably already know all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=45.99s">We</a>  should get the phone number on those agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=51.835s">Additional</a>  questions or comments could be submitted during the meeting by emailing me at pruseau at medford.k12.ma.us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=62.778s">Those</a>  submitting must include the following information, your first and last name, your Medford Street address, or if you are an employee, just indicate that, your question or comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=73.24s">The</a>  agenda for today is to take up the motion to move the management of life-threatening allergies policy to the Rules and Policy Subcommittee as <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=81.842s">amended</a>  to include staff in the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=83.824s">I</a>  forget the date. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=86.246s">This</a>  was, I think it was May when we did that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=91.289s">So</a>  it's 24 pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=94.912s">So</a>  let me just- June 18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=99.055s">June</a>  18th. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=99.676s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=101.017s">Oh,</a>  I need to take a roll call. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=102.778s">Let</a>  me open up my mail and record that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=109.943s">Member</a>  Grant.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=111.78s">Here.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=113.222s">Member</a>  Bramley.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=114.403s">Here.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=114.603s">And</a>  Member Ruseau. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=117.846s">Here.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=118.267s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=119.608s">All</a>  present. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=120.469s">We</a>  have a quorum. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=122.967s">So</a>  I wanted to start off with if anybody has any specific parts of this that they want to talk about, we can go to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=132.811s">I</a>  don't think reading a 24-page policy is going to get us done in the next six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=141.694s">And</a>  it's actually all on the agenda, so hopefully people have had a chance to read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=146.036s">I</a>  will screen share when we get to that part, when people have something they want to look at, so we don't have to <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=151.618s">to</a>  the imagine if you will kind of approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=155.102s">I</a>  want to welcome the superintendent, Mr. O'Leary, our new director of, I forgot the technical title of the department is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=164.491s">Athletics,</a>  is that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=165.973s">Is</a>  it just called department? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=167.414s">Sorry,</a>  I should know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=168.996s">And</a>  of course, our director of nursing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=173.02s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=173.961s">In</a>  community schools.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=175.439s">Okay,</a>  and community schools, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=176.5s">And</a>  I thought it was longer than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=178.18s">And</a>  our Director of Nursing, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=179.841s">Silva,</a>  and we also have our Director of Food Services, Rhetta Smith. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=186.465s">And</a>  I think that's everybody I should be acknowledging real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=192.328s">So</a>  does anybody want to start with any comments on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=197.99s">This</a>  is not our first rodeo on this.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=200.151s">I</a>  just have a couple of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=207.003s">Um,</a>  so when we talked about this back in June, we talked about, um. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=215.327s">Wanting</a>  to engage some of the folks who are, I'll say, implicated in this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=223.709s">who</a>  we don't particularly have direct control over, like the PTOs in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=229.538s">Rob</a>  is here from an athletics perspective, so that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=232.782s">And</a>  I'm just curious if that has been done and what the feedback was.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=241.515s">So</a>  I did send this to the PTO leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=246.518s">I</a>  have not heard back from really any of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=249.579s">When</a>  we were developing this policy, though, we did speak to some PTO members who gave us feedback on what was here, which is why some of the items that are included here are included in the policy.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=261.486s">And</a>  what was their feedback? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=264.167s">I</a>  feel like overall, our PTOs are super <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=270.162s">interested</a>  in helping, but this, to me, my read of this is that we are substantially changing how PTOs are being asked to operate when it comes to food. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=283.11s">So</a>  I'm just curious what their reactions were.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=285.192s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=286.913s">Shanine,</a>  are you on the call? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=288.794s">Because</a>  I think she had a little bit more feedback from PTOs than I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=293.957s">I</a>  am.</p>

    <p>[Chenine Peloquin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=296.139s">I'm</a>  just walking back from the skate park opening, so pardon. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=301.772s">So</a>  we spoke at length with both Missituk and Roberts PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=308.016s">And</a>  I mean, I guess I want to take a step back really quickly, and I will answer that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=314.879s">But</a>  I want to start this meeting acknowledging that the reason we are here is because children can die. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=322.523s">That</a>  is the reason we are doing this policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=325.565s">There</a>  is a fear every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=327.626s">Go</a>  find the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=329.227s">Because</a>  I told you to. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=329.947s">Go.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=335.475s">There</a>  is a fear every time I send my child or any of us with children with life-threatening allergies, send our child to soccer practice or lunch in the cafeteria or a birthday party or any of that, that someone is going to make a mistake and we are going to get that call. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=354.205s">That</a>  is why we are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=356.926s">And</a>  we want to make sure that it is easy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=358.407s">And</a>  I don't think anything in this policy <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=361.593s">is</a>  an unreasonable expectation for anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=365.296s">But</a>  I just wanted to ground us, because I think that in June when we met, that part, that importance of why this policy needs to exist, and the reason we made the recommendations we did, is to keep children safe and included in their school communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=380.95s">So</a>  as for the PTOs, the brown boots, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=388.655s">And</a>  mesothelioma already does a lot in terms of considering allergies. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=395.999s">And</a>  Robert talked about there being a difference between when the PTOs are serving food as a fundraiser purpose, when the grownups are going to be buying food, and when they are serving food to children for some sort of special event, and the importance of labeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=418.269s">So,</a>  um.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=426.193s">And</a>  and did we lose?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=428.274s">Sorry?</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=429.055s">No,</a>  I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=430.075s">Did</a>  we get any feedback from. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=433.037s">The</a>  middle schools are in the high school, because I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=436.708s">The</a>  conversation changes over time, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=440.069s">As</a>  someone with a life-threatening allergy myself, I 100% understand the need for the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=448.512s">I</a>  just am trying to understand how we have engaged the people whose workflows, as they were, we're asking to change so that we can be useful and helpful to them as they do that.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=468.397s">Yeah,</a>  unfortunately, we did not hear back from middle school and high school PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=474.082s">So</a>  I do think that we are asking for a change, but to follow on what Shane said, I don't think any of it's really unreasonable. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=481.75s">I</a>  think a lot of it is going to just focus around, one, making sure that people are aware of food allergies, because I think that part of what <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=489.577s">this</a>  policy is attempting to do is just make sure people are more educated. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=493.56s">You</a>  know, there was just, for example, homecoming was last weekend and a kiddo came to the high school nursing office asking if there was going to be an option for kids who were gluten free. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=501.526s">And</a>  at that moment in time, there were not any options for kids who were gluten free. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=505.149s">And</a>  so the school nurse and the principal worked together to make sure that that would happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=509.712s">And</a>  so I guess what we're trying to say is, hey, like we need people to be aware of these things so that we do make sure that one, we're keeping kids safe and that we're being inclusive. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=517.295s">And</a>  I think those are the two pieces that this is trying to accomplish.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=522.917s">Yeah,</a>  and I think that's like actually a great example, right, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=528.739s">If</a>  you don't have a food allergy yourself and there's, by the way, a million versions of food allergies, so even if you have one, it doesn't mean you're particularly tuned in to them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=540.948s">And</a>  without the right support, the organizers of events are doing their best and not intending really to cause a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=553.83s">And</a>  then there's like this like scramble that happens when this comes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=558.951s">So</a>  I think one question, the reason that I am asking about their involvement is because I think we have to, for this policy to be successful, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=569.068s">we</a>  have to figure out how to shift that conversation so that it is not happening at the last minute when people begin to feel excluded, when people are already sort of in like final prep mode, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=589.743s">And</a>  now we're saying, drop everything about your day and help us solve this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=594.507s">So</a>  I think one question that I, the reason that I care so much about this is because <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=600.207s">think</a>  if done right, we can be hugely assistive in this process. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=605.968s">And</a>  I'm curious what that looks like at different levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=612.409s">I</a>  think the conversation's completely different at elementary school than it is at high school for a whole variety of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=619.911s">So</a>  I do want to hear their voices in this conversation, because I think that's super important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=627.194s">Um,</a>  the other thing that struck me about this policy is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=633.157s">There's</a>  a lot going on in this policy that makes it that I think is going to make it hard for us to get compliance against it's 22 pages. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=642.382s">It</a>  does include roles and responsibilities, which are governed by labor contracts. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=649.045s">So,</a>  it, it's not enough for us to, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=653.92s">put</a>  it in a policy and then expect that everybody will be able to do those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=662.383s">There</a>  are some tentacles there that we have to think through. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=667.665s">But</a>  I think overall, if there is a way for us to separate the policy from the education and the assistive pieces of this, I think all of those pieces will get much more use. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=683.852s">than</a>  this living in its current format, because I think the current format is hard to digest. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=692.596s">And</a>  I don't think that's the intention. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=695.417s">I</a>  think it's intended to be very useful. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=699.879s">But</a>  I think it has to be parsed a little bit differently for that to really work in practice.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=705.24s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=705.76s">And</a>  I think, I mean, I do think that makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=707.221s">I</a>  think the intention was, the way we tried to make it more user-friendly is that you are a teacher and you go directly to your section. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=714.464s">You</a>  are an administrator, you go directly to your section. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=716.845s">So</a>  that is why it's so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=718.645s">It's</a>  because we really tried to parse out, okay, who's responsible for what different things. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=722.707s">But</a>  I do, and actually Rob and I had this conversation earlier today about needing to involve our collective bargaining and what are we looking at when we're looking at roles and responsibilities as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=731.67s">So</a>  that totally makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=733.971s">I</a>  do think that we could reconvene our team who's worked on this to look at how do we parse out the policy and then have those roles and responsibilities as like separate appendices that are in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=745.496s">If</a>  that would be a good way to do it, I would be open to any thoughts.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=749.978s">Yeah,</a>  my thoughts on this are <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=753.135s">you</a>  know, just from a policy hygiene, my new favorite word around policy, is that, you know, we can have, and the way the structure of policies, there's like a national policy, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=768.478s">sort</a>  of like the old Dewey Decimal System, if you will, there's like a structure that makes no sense to anybody, but that there is one, is that we have like the top level policy, and then you have other policies that are just under it rather than part of the same policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=784.766s">And</a>  what I like about that is that you can really target, well, you can target <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=793.064s">training</a>  you can you know say building administrators you really all need to know this and it's not 24 pages long as as we all agree is too much um but also there's so much that is in here that different people who are coming the different audiences of this are just not interested in like this isn't relevant to them so um by burying it there um we're asking an awful lot of people to um <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=824.333s">to</a>  find it, get lucky and find it in the index of, you know, a whole page index. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=830.536s">So,</a>  yeah, breaking it up so that it is, meets the different audiences, but also the different purposes that multiple audience members might come to this.</p>

    <p>[Chenine Peloquin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=844.542s">Shanine?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=849.805s">I</a>  want to push back a little bit on the length of it being so problematic because <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=855.299s">part</a>  of the whole design was to make sure that you could figure out without having to parse all the different roles, what is the role of this person? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=862.565s">What</a>  is the role of this person? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=863.626s">And</a>  it repeats those things a lot, which is a lot of the length of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=867.77s">But</a>  it actually should be easier to find like, I'm a para, what's the policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=871.893s">What's</a>  my responsibility versus what is my lead teacher's responsibility versus the health director, all of those things that actually divides those roles in a way that's much clearer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=884.152s">And</a>  I do want to remind this group that we all of these even splitting out the roles was based on the recommendations of the best policies group at food allergy research and education and the CDC.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=897.698s">Yeah,</a>  I certainly. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=900.087s">when</a>  I think about a policy that's here's the policy that is just pointers to the other sections like the index. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=910.571s">I</a>  don't want to suggest that I'm lazy but when I see a 24-page document I have to read <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=917.473s">I</a>  don't just plop down. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=918.814s">I</a>  have to figure out when do I have time to read 24 pages, even though I might only really need to read two. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=926.217s">It's</a>  just like when we get emails and they scroll and scroll and scroll. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=930.539s">I'll</a>  get to that later, which often means we don't get to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=935.341s">And</a>  I don't think of that as just a time management problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=937.222s">I</a>  think that is information overload. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=943.117s">Like,</a>  yeah, so that's just my thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=946.221s">I</a>  mean, we did take the bullying policy down from, I don't remember, dozens of pages down to a number that we all agreed there's no excuse for not having read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=959.013s">Um,</a>  but I think that, you know, I mean, some of the people who will be needing this are working three hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=965.397s">Um,</a>  so when are we expecting them to, I mean, I guess that's professional development and administrative management problem, not mine, but, uh, superintendent, I think you have something you want to say.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=979.245s">I</a>  think having been at multiple levels in the district, I think something like this is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=989.115s">to</a>  make sure that we're providing information. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=993.559s">Something</a>  like food allergies is something that is constantly ever-evolving, fluid, new allergies are coming on all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1004.107s">There's</a>  a lot of conversation and discussion at every school building between the nursing office, caregivers, teachers, school leaders, and <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1018.258s">every</a>  time there are like new allergies that are added to this list and then ways that you have to now think in order to prepare spaces and make students make sure that students are included and that those pieces are there on behalf of our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1034.604s">So</a>  I think the informational part and the discussion part is for sure needed <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1041.908s">um,</a>  around food allergies, food allergy awareness, food allergy training. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1047.935s">I</a>  think the only, you know, the piece that's like really resonating with me is that there, because <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1055.36s">It's</a>  the way it's organized. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1057.322s">I</a>  appreciate having all the different roles and responsibilities right there for our employees and for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1067.07s">But</a>  we we just have to do a level of communication that I think we haven't really done yet in terms of like having getting people around a table and talking to them about what this means. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1078.42s">I</a>  don't think it's something that we can just like send out. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1081.205s">and</a>  then expect that people are gonna like read it, and there's this like level of compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1086.809s">Of</a>  course, member Graham already mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1090.992s">the</a>  piece around a lot of these people are bargaining members that we really have to work through. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1095.914s">But</a>  there's just a lot of, in my opinion, levels of conversation that we just have to have before I think we can proceed with making this an official policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1107.017s">And</a>  I don't know if the conversation is, is this a policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1109.518s">Is</a>  this guidance? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1112.098s">But</a>  I just think we need to plan some conversations.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1117.2s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1124.228s">Um,</a>  can you hear me? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1126.289s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1127.109s">Um,</a>  I think it's, I think it's both. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1129.09s">I</a>  think there are clear policy statements in here, like threats of harassment for students with food allergies will be taken seriously and dealt with in accordance with a reference to our bullying policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1141.075s">That</a>  is a policy statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1143.596s">There,</a>  an allergy table is not something we're going to do as a policy statement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1149.158s">And</a>  I think those things belong. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1151.348s">like</a>  in a compressed format in terms of like what we as a collective are and aren't going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1159.71s">But</a>  the second part of it is the guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1162.711s">And</a>  I do think it's super helpful for people to have guidance that like they can go to their part and understand what their part is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1170.534s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1172.495s">there</a>  should be one for coaches because coaches are gonna deal with like a kind of a different, a different like slice of all of this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1180.778s">Then</a>  PTOs, then paras. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1183.719s">So</a>  that piece to me, like sort of like snaps out and becomes guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1192.002s">Like</a>  this is our policy, this is where you go for guidance and the guidance, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1198.82s">I</a>  would like my preference would be that the maintenance of that guidance can reside with the director of nursing and not necessitate, like, a big policy review. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1212.044s">If</a>  something has to change, because I think what will happen in practice is things will evolve and change. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1217.763s">And</a>  we want to be responsive to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1219.124s">And</a>  as soon as your documentation is out of date, it is useless. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1222.807s">So</a>  we can't, you know, if something needs to change because it was confusing or in practice, like, somebody asked a question and we're like, that's a great point. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1234.094s">We</a>  should include that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1235.075s">We</a>  should include that in the guidance for PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1239.138s">Whatever</a>  that may be, like, being able to change it so that that guidance is applicable and resonates with the people it's intended to be supportive of is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1252.162s">to</a>  me, ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1253.302s">And</a>  that doesn't happen in a policy that requires subcommittee and multiple readings, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1261.224s">If</a>  something is needing to be changed in real time, I want it to be able to be changed in real time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1265.205s">So</a>  I think if we think about, to me, there's two pieces, policy and guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1270.026s">And</a>  there's maybe some overlap of things that are not going to change in a really wily way, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1277.268s">But</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1280.023s">I</a>  want to get both pieces right and put the right things in the right bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1287.349s">So</a>  I don't think it's necessarily that structurally the repetition is bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1294.294s">I</a>  think that repetition belongs in the guidance and not in the policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1301.38s">But</a>  when I look at policy, actually, I was just talking to somebody about our AI policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1308.292s">And</a>  it was also very long. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1310.454s">And</a>  I said, in summary, our policy is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1314.277s">And</a>  I said it in like two and a half sentences. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1317.319s">It</a>  was very long. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1318.52s">And</a>  it substantively was the same as two and a half sentences. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1323.024s">So</a>  I'm always a fan of the policy being like really crisp and concise so there can be no confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1331.07s">We</a>  don't do allergy tables. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1332.851s">We</a>  take bullying seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1334.092s">Whatever</a>  those things are so that <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1338.163s">It's</a>  simple to know what we're expected to implement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1344.046s">The</a>  guidance then has to back it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1346.908s">So</a>  I think, to me, that's like there's two things happening in this document. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1350.69s">And</a>  they both have to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1353.751s">But</a>  I don't think they should happen in the same document.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1359.675s">Bob.</a> </p>

    <p>[Rob O'Leary]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1360.874s">Yeah,</a>  so I just saw this this morning for the first time, but a couple of things that I can't agree with more that was just said almost so. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1369.797s">But</a>  the biggest thing I think from athletic standpoint is. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1373.779s">I</a>  want more parents involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1375.8s">I</a>  want more people involved and I feel like like the first line of like a couple of things like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1382.022s">Team</a>  dinners, like we have to have a menu set before that, like that, that is an athletic director as a coach is going to be next to impossible. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1389.047s">And</a>  I'm not a fan of putting policy in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1391.189s">We</a>  can't follow through with, you know, if we have a team dinner that we didn't even know about because the kids put it on or the parents put it on or something outside of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1401.236s">Jen</a>  and I talked about this this morning a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1403.558s">You</a>  know, that's a lot different than something that's happening inside of the school or at somebody's house, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1408.7s">I</a>  love the fact, a lot of districts use like a letter that is sent out. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1413.482s">I</a>  did a little quick research after Jen and I met this afternoon that is sent out to like a team that says, doesn't tell you who, but somebody on the team has celiac disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1423.446s">And</a>  if you're planning a team dinner, please be aware of this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1427.107s">So</a>  if we could get that information and then <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1429.468s">You</a>  know, foster it out through the nursing office or through my office, I guess me is like, if we can, if we can get that information and then get it out to the teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1439.762s">And</a>  it doesn't have to be a policy, but more of a guidance of, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1444.7s">You</a>  know hit hit someone on the team has has this allergy or someone on the team has this allergy and then we can hope that the parents follow through with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1453.864s">And</a>  also I think that the the biggest thing I saw in that was you know just the. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1463.913s">The</a>  change of a job description for a coach, if we're making it a policy as a former union president, I would say that we'd have to at least change our job descriptions and added somewhere in the job postings when we're doing it that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1479.711s">We</a>  want them to take the allergy course and pass it because right now they're not doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1485.694s">And</a>  if we're going to do that, we should probably add it in for the next season that we're going to post coaching positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1492.538s">We</a>  have concussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1493.858s">We</a>  have things that Jen and I talked about earlier, the concussion, the CPI, the first aid. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1498.501s">It's</a>  not a major thing to add it, but we should add it if we're looking to get that done sooner rather than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1507.694s">But</a>  the team dinner thing is what jumped out at me right away, because sometimes we don't even know about a team dinner that happens.</p>

    <p>[Chenine Peloquin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1522.979s">I</a>  guess my question, and this is not my general sphere, but what's the difference in terms of enforceability between a guidance and a policy? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1534.208s">I</a>  mean, even just what Mr. O'Leary just said of hoping the parents follow through on that, like, team dinners are a prime issue for kids having accidental reactions. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1543.356s">So</a>  I just, what is the difference, Paul, between or?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1548.298s">Yeah,</a>  the difference, there's no difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1551.399s">Both</a>  written policy of the school committee as well as guidance that the superintendent essentially is issuing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1559.162s">In</a>  both cases, it's the superintendent who's responsible for enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1563.723s">So</a>  it really falls to how the superintendent is willing to enforce <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1570.206s">So</a>  anything that is not, so we don't have a life-threatening allergy policy today, but that isn't that we don't actually have, we don't have an official school committee policy, but the district and the superintendent, what they say is policy unless we have overridden it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1589.037s">So</a>  everything that's missing from our policy manual is not, it's just a wild west. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1596.72s">It's</a>  up to the central administration and what they say is policy if the school committee has not spoken on it, which of course is totally the opposite of anything legislative in any other setting where until the legislative body has said something, it doesn't exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1616.028s">But</a>  I think that's part of the 1993 Ed Reform Act that gave that kind of authority to superintendents. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1623.392s">And</a>  some of it is just to principals too, which I find a little annoying that sometimes principals have authority that actually the superintendent doesn't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1632.218s">But</a>  anyways, we don't need to rehash that.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1634.339s">But</a>  I think the team dinner is like a really good example of like we, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1642.527s">we</a>  can have a policy, but without the right support in place, a parent with good intentions could do something that causes harm, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1658.779s">And</a>  nobody's intending to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1662.982s">But</a>  the question then becomes, to Shanine's point, about consequence, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1672.026s">consequence</a>  a parent who didn't provide an alternative. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1678.21s">What</a>  are we going to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1678.831s">Kick</a>  their kid off the team? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1681.212s">Are</a>  we going to suspend the kid? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1683.934s">We</a>  don't have enforcement authority in those situations. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1689.438s">So</a>  what we have to do instead is make it exceedingly easy for people to be able to comply. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1695.642s">And</a>  so when you talk about team dinners, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1699.133s">It</a>  should be, I think, pretty simple for the coaches at the beginning of the season, when they finalize their roster, to collect the food allergies that are there. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1711.984s">And</a>  then if there is a parent who is wanting to host a dinner, that list can be passed to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1719.15s">So</a>  it's not their responsibility to go ask all the kids <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1725.135s">what</a>  their food allergies are. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1726.376s">And</a>  at the high school level, by the way, you're going to get more answers from the kids than you are from the parents. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1734.562s">And</a>  only if the kids sort of decide to respond. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1741.568s">And</a>  it doesn't mean they're not going to show up at your house like, surprise, I have this allergy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1746.412s">And</a>  now there's something happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1748.333s">So</a>  I think there are some ways for us to engage <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1754.494s">with</a>  some basic systems in place to be proactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1760.777s">And</a>  then at the beginning, when the coaches are having their meeting with parents, they're saying, we want to have team dinners. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1767.481s">We</a>  encourage you to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1768.982s">And</a>  if you're going to do that, here are some things that you need to know about our team so that we can keep everybody safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1775.565s">And</a>  then it's not about like, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1777.406s">failure</a>  and consequences, which we really don't sort of have the authority to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1781.851s">But</a>  instead about, let me make this easy for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1785.014s">Like,</a>  Lucas wants to have a team dinner. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1786.897s">And</a>  I was like, okay, we can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1790.3s">What</a>  do you serve a bunch of teenage boys? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1793.263s">Like,</a>  it seems like it would be very complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1795.446s">And</a>  he said, Oh, he went to a team dinner and they serve lasagna. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1798.749s">And</a>  I'm like, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1799.83s">Wild</a>  that no one has celiacs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1801.252s">I</a>  don't know if that's true or not, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1803.856s">But</a>  I was like, well, I'm glad everyone liked lasagna. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1806.561s">And</a>  then he's like, well, there was a lot left over. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1808.083s">And</a>  I'm like, maybe they didn't like lasagna. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1809.826s">It's</a>  hard to know, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1811.749s">The</a>  team changes all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1815.287s">I</a>  think as a parent, I'm happy to open up my home and do those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1819.931s">But</a>  it sure would be nice if somebody could hand me a little roadmap on how to do that and be successful, both in a safety perspective. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1830.498s">And</a>  also, I'm not serving anyone shellfish in my house, because that is my life-threatening allergy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1837.583s">There's</a>  plenty of others that would happen that sort of evolve in my house. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1840.965s">I</a>  just realized I was eating a container of nuts while we were talking, ironically. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1846.428s">But</a>  it sure would be nice if it could just be a little bit easier for people to engage in those ways that we want them to. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1853.351s">And</a>  it would keep everyone safe, too, which is actually the point. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1858.594s">I</a>  think parents will as much appreciate the assistance <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1865.032s">in</a>  being able to show up for their kids in these ways.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1871.935s">So</a>  I think I just have one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1874.937s">If</a>  we were to sever part of the responsibilities, all of these boxes of what everybody is going to do, where do we put it and how do we enforce it? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1885.502s">Is</a>  there really a way to enforce it? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1886.923s">I</a>  mean, as it being guidance?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1893.553s">I</a>  mean, we don't.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Branley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1894.734s">We're</a>  kind of doing it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1896.154s">And</a>  you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1896.775s">Probably</a>  not to this extent. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1898.236s">I</a>  mean, I was a para. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1899.756s">So,</a>  you know, that was always a topic of conversation, especially in the classroom day to day. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1906.44s">We</a>  we always I don't think there was ever a class that didn't have an allergy of some sort in there and having snack, especially as kindergartners in the classroom. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1915.865s">It</a>  was something that was, you know, the topic at all times. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1918.386s">I</a>  check snacks as a para just to make sure everybody was safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1923.087s">So,</a>  I mean, I guess to have some sort of guidance is great because I think sometimes we do lack that with, you know, lots of different things, you know, like you kind of get put in a position and you're like, OK, this is what I'm doing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1935.669s">But</a>  how do we separate maybe these boxes of responsibilities for people without violating anything in the <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1945.576s">CBAs,</a>  right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1947.597s">How</a>  do we incorporate all of this to be good guidance, but a really crisp policy on its own?</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1956.96s">So</a>  first off, our muscle is the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1960.502s">She</a>  is our enforcer. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1962.923s">And</a>  I hope somebody does an AI version of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1967.404s">But</a>  I think what you would find in policies that would be something like the superintendent <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1975.242s">or</a>  designee, sorry, will create and maintain roles and responsibilities and annually ensure that all relevant staff are aware of those instead of specifying what those are. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=1992.874s">And</a>  I think that that is, you know, when you think about like federal legislation, like that legislation almost always says some department will go off and figure out what we really meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2005.712s">That's</a>  what most laws do not say actually what should happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2010.275s">They</a>  say somebody who's an expert will go off and write the regulations, CMF, the regulations that make sense because the legislators, and in this case, the school committee, even if we do have it, the problem is that, and remember Graham mentioned this earlier, is that <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2030.706s">our</a>  ability to respond quickly to needs to changes in policy is limited. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2036.493s">I</a>  mean, just by the number of meetings we have and by the fact that we have 180 backlogged policies, we still need to update. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2045.925s">And</a>  frankly, I have been working to get this done since <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2049.93s">Tony</a>  was the director like we were communicating back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2056.794s">And</a>  so we at that time we were also taking the, you know, throw it all in kitchen sink kind of approach. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2064.178s">So</a>  I think that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2066.12s">In</a>  that time we haven't had official school committee policy, and I think part of that is because we were including too much and. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2075.805s">At</a>  this hands up so who was next?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2081.938s">Maybe</a>  it was me.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2083.339s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2083.839s">Go</a>  ahead, Jen. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2085.7s">I</a>  just want to say, so clearly, we were trying to make this as easy as possible for people. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2091.023s">That's</a>  part of why we broke it down into the roles and responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2094.685s">I</a>  definitely see the difference between having this policy and this guidance. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2098.267s">But</a>  to Nicole's point, yes, the superintendent can help us and for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2103.35s">But</a>  a lot of this is stuff we're already doing, already asking of people to do that they're not doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2108.386s">So</a>  for example, when we're asking principals to not have allergy tables in their cafeterias, there are schools- And you have an implementation problem.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2117.732s">You</a>  don't have a policy problem, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2119.873s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2121.033s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2122.594s">So,</a>  and I think whether it's policy or guidance, like it only works if you're gonna roll it out and you're gonna tell everybody what's expected of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2134.101s">And</a>  until you do that, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2135.906s">The</a>  compliance is not going to be there, not because people are being willful and ignoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2142.638s">Maybe</a>  maybe they are at the moment, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2148.467s">From</a>  a change management perspective, you have to tell people what you expect of them before you can expect to see change. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2155.712s">So</a>  once we figure this out, there probably needs to be some professional development that is targeted so that not just does everyone understand what the policy is, but they understand why, so that they can get on the bus with the change. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2173.045s">And</a>  carrot, stick, we're going to use them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2176.727s">If</a>  people still have allergy tables, there needs to be some dialogue about why and what help do they need to make the move in their building because the move is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2187.657s">So</a>  tell us what you need and then let's make that happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2190.62s">That's</a>  how you make change. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2191.941s">So</a>  once this is all said and done, there does have to be <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2197.408s">Uh,</a>  like, a re, level 2nd, there are people who've been in our buildings for, like, 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2201.953s">So,</a>  like, I've been here for 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2203.734s">Of</a>  course, I know about allergies. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2205.816s">Well,</a>  do you maybe you thought you did, but you don't so you so we do have, like, that to me is about implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2214.945s">and</a>  having a thoughtful implementation plan that goes with this so that the coaches have a space to go and be like, Rob, this is just too much. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2224.174s">I</a>  don't know how I'm going to do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2226.136s">We</a>  need people to articulate those kinds of reactions and implementation. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2231.121s">Because</a>  only once they do, can you then work that apart and actually help them be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2239.589s">But</a>  it's a little bit more complicated than just saying, do what I told you to do, if what you really want is compliance and results. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2248.734s">So</a>  it's incredibly painful.</p>

    <p>[Suzanne Galusi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2250.875s">And</a>  Rhetta has her hand up, so I don't wanna like jump, although I am jumping in front of her, I'm sorry, Rhetta. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2257.119s">But</a>  I think that just, I just wanna like kind of punctuate what you just said, member Graham, only because that's the piece that I'm talking about when I mentioned that <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2267.594s">we</a>  have to have explicit, intentional conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2271.477s">And</a>  to my knowledge, those haven't started yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2274.399s">And</a>  if they, on a global level, that's going to meet all of these roles right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2282.224s">And</a>  that's the piece that I think is where we need to go in the next, like as our next step to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2291.39s">Because</a>  I don't know, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2293.963s">I</a>  don't know how explicit it's been or how many conversations have been with the specific roles that are listed here. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2303.667s">And</a>  I think Jen and I can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2308.589s">With</a>  Retta.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2311.01s">Sorry,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Smith]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2312.32s">That's</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2313.22s">Um,</a>  I wanted to, um, I don't know if it's a point of clarification or just, uh, maybe I'm a little bit confused, but I, um, thought that with this policy, really our intention, um, and talking about PTOs and other activities was going to be things that were, you know, explicitly sponsored by the schools or part of the PTOs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2335.671s">And</a>  Jen has. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2337.442s">thing,</a>  I don't know, substantive assistance or something that makes the PTO kind of come under the authority of the school policies, rather than a parent who wants to invite all the kids over on a <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2354.133s">team</a>  to have dinners, you know, if the booster club is, you know, putting it on, I know like the track dinners we did in the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2363.395s">So</a>  of course, like we followed lots of rules with those meals that were being provided. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2370.277s">And</a>  just trying to say that it's not like if anybody wants to try to feed kids outside of school hours, these rules do not apply to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2378.019s">But</a>  I think just in my experience, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2382.582s">there</a>  are things that are being put on by the schools or the PTOs that aren't considering the needs of students who have food allergies, many of them who have 504s that explicitly say that accommodations will be made, but they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2398.426s">And</a>  they're just, it's not really something that's being considered.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2404.727s">Oh,</a>  thank you for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2407.128s">This</a>  is sort of a question I don't, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2411.247s">I</a>  don't know the answer to, but if you have a team of 20 students, 20 athletes, and the coach, every time there's a change in the roster says, or at the beginning of the season, can I get a list of food allergies so that I can send this around to the parents? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2434.381s">I'm</a>  just wondering about, <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2437.65s">And</a>  when there's 20, that's one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2439.953s">What</a>  if it's a very small group? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2443.497s">Or</a>  one kid joins and now there is a food allergy. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2448.703s">How</a>  do we deal with the privacy related issues there? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2452.567s">And</a>  I don't know what they are, what they aren't. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2456.531s">And</a>  I'm just very curious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2460.578s">Because</a>  obviously keeping people safe isn't just, it can't just be on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2466.546s">It's</a>  like with the summer school stuff that we've offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2470.311s">If</a>  a kid's on an IEP and they don't want the summer camp folks that we have to know, well then that kid will go. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2479.565s">the</a>  disabilities that the kid has will not be known by the staff, which is not ideal, but we can't just hand over that kind of information, even to people that work for us in the summer program. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2493.662s">So</a>  I'm curious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2496.566s">And</a>  Jen, do you have an answer?</p>

    <p>[Jennifer Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2498.851s">Yes,</a>  so we obviously can't provide lists of students matched to their food allergies. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2503.617s">We</a>  can provide general information. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2505.92s">But</a>  the other thing that we can do is ask parents to provide that information on sports registrations on club registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2511.607s">So</a>  this is something that Mississippi Tech does really well with their after school clubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2515.552s">they</a>  ask for that information on the afterschool club registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2518.412s">So</a>  that way it's the parents providing that information directly to the afterschool club volunteers or, you know, cause it's run by the PTO. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2525.614s">Rob</a>  and I actually talked about today that we can incorporate it into sports registration. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2528.874s">So</a>  that is not, and it's not on us, like the nurses sharing that information or the trainer, it's the parents sharing that information directly.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2537.856s">And</a>  you could also just ask the parents to say, I am also authorizing that this can be shared with <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2545.323s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2546.559s">people</a>  on the team who may be involved in providing food, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2549.942s">Like</a>  I think you could also ask parents like at registration, which is like the perfect place to do it because whether you're going to respond to the coach mid-season or not, like you do have to register your kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2561.992s">So</a>  like that is the perfect place. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2564.394s">And</a>  if you're willing, you know, and if you say, yes, my kid has an allergy and yes, you can tell people about it, then it's a real, it's a real easy thing for the coach to hand over the list to somebody who needs it. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2576.689s">Um,</a>  and I also think, like, when you're talking about team dinners, you're usually talking about high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2582.232s">And</a>  by the time high school rolls around, like. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2586.173s">Food</a>  allergies are something kids are very accustomed to, like, there's food allergies all around them all the time and. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2595.935s">Kids</a>  talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2598.237s">Kids</a>  are going to talk about that stuff much more openly, I think, than if you were talking about much younger kids anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2604.902s">So</a>  I tell everybody who needs to know about my life-threatening allergy, because it's like a defense mechanism, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2614.048s">It's</a>  how I keep myself safe when somebody puts shellfish stock in something that has nothing to do with shellfish. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2621.113s">So</a>  I do think that's a great. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2626.036s">operational</a>  way to collect and distribute this information without putting the district in the middle of privacy concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/9XNxJ6SowDU&t=2636.706s">But</a>  we could also run that by our attorney.</p>
