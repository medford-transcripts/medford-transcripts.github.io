[SPEAKER_10]: Make a motion to take the good of the order off the table.

00:46:23,995 --> 00:46:28,376
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to take number three off the table, good of the order.

46
00:46:29,097 --> 00:46:29,397
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

47
00:46:30,157 --> 00:46:32,018
[SPEAKER_11]: By Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

48
00:46:32,718 --> 00:46:33,399
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

49
00:46:33,859 --> 00:46:34,139
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

50
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:35,079
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

51
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

52
00:46:40,602 --> 00:46:41,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

53
00:46:42,142 --> 00:46:42,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

54
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:49,929
[SPEAKER_10]: for the good of the order, which is basically us assessing how we're doing collaboratively as a school committee.

55
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:52,550
[SPEAKER_10]: And we review monthly what we need to do.

56
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:59,112
[SPEAKER_10]: I know in the past we talked about and we approved a motion for us to meet to set school committee goals.

57
00:46:59,932 --> 00:47:04,293
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know that we talked about that potentially happening as a committee of the whole.

58
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:11,455
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was wondering if we could consider this as a committee of the whole before one of our monthly meetings next month.

59
00:47:12,313 --> 00:47:21,335
[SPEAKER_10]: and in which case, if we do, I know that I shared some information earlier about the MASC conference, but there was definitely a session there in particular that the MASC offers.

60
00:47:21,395 --> 00:47:29,017
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, it's our rep, Dorothy Presser, that offers it specifically on school committee goals, but also aligning those goals with superintendent goals.

61
00:47:29,097 --> 00:47:32,858
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sure that could be available to us as a recording.

62
00:47:32,898 --> 00:47:38,479
[SPEAKER_10]: I think they recorded several of the sessions and or as a PowerPoint, if we want those ahead of time to prepare for the meeting.

63
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:41,520
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess I'm putting out there for my colleagues

64
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:50,492
[SPEAKER_10]: if we can consider a meeting, a committee of the whole to address our school committee goals here for next month.

65
00:47:51,652 --> 00:47:57,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Yep, we have a meeting on the 5th and the 19th.

66
00:47:57,433 --> 00:48:06,055
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm superintendent, if we could schedule a goals meeting before a regular committee meeting on one of those two days at five o'clock, that'd be great.

67
00:48:08,175 --> 00:48:08,435
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

68
00:48:09,003 --> 00:48:09,463
[SPEAKER_08]: Member Hayes.

69
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:10,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

70
00:48:10,103 --> 00:48:11,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I also had something for the good of the order.

71
00:48:11,924 --> 00:48:32,372
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to, as we've talked a lot about trying to get more student engagement and student involvement, I wanted to discuss the possibility or at least bring up the possibility of having an agenda item that's actually dedicated to the student representatives, so that if they had something they wanted to talk about, if there was an issue, a question, a concern,

72
00:48:33,555 --> 00:48:41,341
[SPEAKER_08]: or if they wanted to highlight the student achievement, anything, just to put it on the agenda so it's not as if they have to approach us to ask if they can talk.

73
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:49,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a thought, just a way to try to give them more space and support their voice in our meetings.

74
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,510
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's a great idea.

75
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:59,415
[SPEAKER_10]: I was also wondering, and thank you for bringing that up through the chair, member Hayes, because I was wondering if there's an opportunity

76
00:48:59,842 --> 00:49:05,065
[SPEAKER_10]: for them to have a microphone as well so that they don't have to come and sit with us sort of to be able to speak.

77
00:49:05,125 --> 00:49:10,567
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we can get, even if, I mean, there's so many opportunities for wireless mics, whatever here, we don't have to have them wired in.

78
00:49:11,088 --> 00:49:19,512
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure between our media center and John McLaughlin, we can get something set up so that there's a microphone where they are able to stay in their seat and speak like the rest of us.

79
00:49:20,232 --> 00:49:21,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be helpful.

80
00:49:22,954 --> 00:49:23,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Russo.

81
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:23,934
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

82
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:25,975
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an excellent, I really liked that idea.

83
00:49:26,095 --> 00:49:28,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I was in communication with the station manager

84
00:49:30,496 --> 00:49:33,758
[SPEAKER_05]: It's today's Tuesday, Monday, this weekend, this weekend.

85
00:49:34,979 --> 00:49:48,349
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said that the mayor had approved spending to do some work to redo all of this stuff, the technology part of the chambers.

86
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:51,431
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that that's an excellent idea.

87
00:49:51,471 --> 00:49:56,374
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that's gonna be happening, then why not just include that spot

88
00:49:58,099 --> 00:50:00,301
[SPEAKER_05]: as being fully wired in, why not?

89
00:50:01,021 --> 00:50:01,321
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

90
00:50:02,342 --> 00:50:03,483
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, there is some upgrades.

91
00:50:04,423 --> 00:50:08,326
[SPEAKER_11]: Big part of our water sewer infrastructure, as well as IT broadband.

92
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:10,087
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have some capacity there.

93
00:50:10,107 --> 00:50:11,949
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

94
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:14,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any kind of a timeline on when that might happen?

95
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:17,212
[SPEAKER_10]: I know sometimes it can take a while for the technology piece.

96
00:50:17,232 --> 00:50:21,395
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe in the interim, we could start with a wireless option or something.

97
00:50:21,715 --> 00:50:24,117
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a wireless mic in the,

98
00:50:25,995 --> 00:50:28,236
[SPEAKER_11]: TV room so we can make sure it's placed on the desk.

99
00:50:28,456 --> 00:50:30,037
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's an easy solution.

100
00:50:30,057 --> 00:50:30,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, for now.

101
00:50:30,737 --> 00:50:30,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

102
00:50:30,997 --> 00:50:34,299
[SPEAKER_11]: And I signed for that IT paper, I believe, last week.

103
00:50:34,339 --> 00:50:36,700
[SPEAKER_11]: So yes, things take some... I like those.

104
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:37,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, there we go.

105
00:50:37,661 --> 00:50:38,321
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. McLaughlin.

106
00:50:38,341 --> 00:50:38,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, John.

107
00:50:39,362 --> 00:50:45,285
[SPEAKER_10]: And then lastly, is there an opportunity that we can get them just a student rep nameplate?

108
00:50:46,305 --> 00:50:46,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

109
00:50:48,286 --> 00:50:50,567
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Clerk Hurtubise orders those.

110
00:50:50,707 --> 00:50:51,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you order these ones?

111
00:50:52,148 --> 00:50:53,208
[SPEAKER_12]: The school side?

112
00:50:56,157 --> 00:51:01,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably the school side.

113
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,681
[SPEAKER_11]: So I would just suggest we put student rep, just one that says student rep.

114
00:51:06,161 --> 00:51:07,282
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's a good idea.

115
00:51:07,302 --> 00:51:07,822
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be great.

116
00:51:07,922 --> 00:51:08,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you.

117
00:51:10,423 --> 00:51:10,663
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

118
00:51:13,845 --> 00:51:15,185
[SPEAKER_11]: No other comment for good of the order.

119
00:51:15,205 --> 00:51:19,167
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll go on to number six, report of subcommittees.

120
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:22,709
[SPEAKER_11]: We have rules, policy, subcommittee minutes, November 16th, 2022.

121
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:23,169
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Russo.

122
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, yes.

123
00:51:27,143 --> 00:51:51,522
[SPEAKER_05]: The Rules Policy Subcommittee met on November 16th, and we began work on the wellness policy update that we had approved in 2019, just before the pandemic, and took up again in May of this year to have our wellness policy updated, the entire policy updated.

124
00:51:51,562 --> 00:51:54,404
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some updates that need to happen from

125
00:51:55,803 --> 00:52:05,388
[SPEAKER_05]: changing regulations, and then also to include a really include recess in the policy which is presently not in the policy at all.

126
00:52:06,368 --> 00:52:15,673
[SPEAKER_05]: The meeting was about an hour and 15 minutes long, and was I thought an excellent conversation we had all of the administrators all the principles.

127
00:52:17,662 --> 00:52:32,615
[SPEAKER_05]: on the meeting and the feedback, the conversation was deep and broad, and we had members of the community that came and also spoke with a lot of expertise, and I was beyond thrilled with the conversation that happened.

128
00:52:33,215 --> 00:52:39,160
[SPEAKER_05]: We had very good, we came up with four different

129
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:56,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Things to just to discuss at the next meeting so we're going to have another meeting in January, where we will be looking specifically at policy language we really just spent this last meeting discuss just hearing from the public and hearing from the administration and the staff about recess.

130
00:52:57,482 --> 00:53:02,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So at the next meeting we will have in January the date is not yet set, we will be looking at policy language.

131
00:53:03,667 --> 00:53:08,490
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully, there are almost every district around us has policy language on recess.

132
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:12,912
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a unusually brief, which is nice.

133
00:53:14,413 --> 00:53:19,115
[SPEAKER_05]: So we will move forward with that at the next rules meeting in January.

134
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:21,876
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be another rules meeting before that on a different topic.

135
00:53:23,097 --> 00:53:23,397
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

136
00:53:26,259 --> 00:53:27,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Member Rousseau.

137

[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by second member Hayes, all those in favor, I minutes pass.

139
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:45,672
[SPEAKER_11]: We have number seven report of the superintendent superintendents updates and comments, Dr. Reset what Vincent.

140
00:53:52,335 --> 00:53:52,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

141
00:53:54,897 --> 00:54:02,838
[SPEAKER_01]: It is unfortunate that this evening I have to share that there was another mass shooting, a hate crime.

142
00:54:02,858 --> 00:54:17,181
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to ask us to take a moment of silence for all the individuals who died in Colorado at Club Q from an LGBTQ attack.

143
00:54:18,821 --> 00:54:22,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Please know that MPS, Medford Public Schools denounces

144
00:54:23,665 --> 00:54:30,231
[SPEAKER_01]: hateful acts of violence that result in senseless killings of so many people.

145
00:54:31,633 --> 00:54:36,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Five people died as a result of yesterday's hate crime.

146
00:54:36,698 --> 00:54:37,458

00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:42,944
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford Public Schools is committed to being an inclusive community for all.

[SPEAKER_01]: spring over the ground like a hunting hound for this is Thanksgiving Day.

282
01:10:40,614 --> 01:10:49,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the river and through the wood and straight through the barnyard gate, we seem to go extremely slow.

283
01:10:49,182 --> 01:10:51,584
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so hard to wait.

284
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,422
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish everyone a wonderful Thanksgiving surrounded by your family, friends and neighbors.

285
01:10:56,483 --> 01:10:57,323
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

286
01:10:57,383 --> 01:10:57,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

287
01:10:58,864 --> 01:10:59,865
[SPEAKER_01]: We have report number two on

288
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:29,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Mass General Law, Chapter 71, Section 37H and 37H and a half, 37H and three fourths, school discipline and student privacy.

289
01:11:29,578 --> 01:11:40,707
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to invite Attorney Felicia Vasudevan from Murphy, Hess, Truman, and Lohan.

290
01:11:41,428 --> 01:11:41,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

291
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:44,910
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome, Felicia.

292
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:46,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, everyone.

293
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:47,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for having me.

294
01:11:49,259 --> 01:11:51,140
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to be sharing my screen.

295
01:11:51,160 --> 01:12:07,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm here to just give an overview on different discipline laws, as well as local policy, school committee policy on discipline that was adopted.

296
01:12:15,782 --> 01:12:28,089
[SPEAKER_06]: So first as an overview, local policy, the Medford School Committee adopted a policy requiring before thinking about suspensions that there's a certain degree of restorative practices.

297
01:12:29,130 --> 01:12:40,477
[SPEAKER_06]: The policy allows school staff to, school administration to engage in suspensions, but says that restorative practices should be used when possible.

298
01:12:41,617 --> 01:12:44,519
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no sort of outright prohibition on

299
01:12:45,499 --> 01:12:53,202
[SPEAKER_06]: suspensions, but does say that generally suspensions should be for five grounds.

300
01:12:53,663 --> 01:12:57,744
[SPEAKER_06]: So one is possession of a weapon or exhibiting violent behavior.

301
01:12:58,725 --> 01:13:03,367
[SPEAKER_06]: Ground two is, you know, language or actions that are based in racism or discrimination.

302
01:13:04,007 --> 01:13:10,450
[SPEAKER_06]: Ground three is sort of bullying or retaliation or words or acts that have an intimidating impact on other students.

303
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:13,771
[SPEAKER_06]: The fourth category is possession of drugs.

304
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:16,109
[SPEAKER_06]: with the potential to distribute.

305
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:27,574
[SPEAKER_06]: And finally is academic integrity, where there's a repeated propensity to engage in behavior that doesn't show academic integrity.

306
01:13:28,174 --> 01:13:33,957
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the local policy and that's overlaid with state policy about suspensions.

307
01:13:34,772 --> 01:13:40,455
[SPEAKER_06]: And state policy about suspensions doesn't dictate sort of when an administrator suspend.

308
01:13:40,595 --> 01:13:46,377
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more about how administration, if they decide to suspend, what process they have to provide.

309
01:13:46,958 --> 01:13:52,300
[SPEAKER_06]: So generally, there are three categories of process offered, depending on the type of offense.

310
01:13:53,981 --> 01:13:58,703
[SPEAKER_06]: The first is 37H, which is weapons, drugs, and assault on staff.

311
01:13:59,824 --> 01:14:02,745
[SPEAKER_06]: The second category is 37H and a half, which is felonies.

312
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:07,779
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's the 37H and three quarters category that's the everything else category.

313
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:19,562
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that could be vaping, that could be bullying, that could be harassment and discrimination, that could be student on student fights.

314
01:14:20,163 --> 01:14:23,243
[SPEAKER_06]: All that fits in the 37H and three quarters category.

315
01:14:24,504 --> 01:14:31,186
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the first category, 37H, that allows the principal to expel or suspend a student.

316
01:14:32,776 --> 01:14:39,242
[SPEAKER_06]: All that's required is notice of an opportunity for hearing before the principal and a hearing before the principal.

317
01:14:39,923 --> 01:14:45,108
[SPEAKER_06]: If the student's expelled, there is a right to appeal to the superintendent.

318
01:14:45,168 --> 01:14:49,371
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's just a suspension, there's no right to appeal to the superintendent.

319
01:14:49,632 --> 01:14:56,098
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, that's only for possession of controlled substance, dangerous weapons, or assault on school staff.

320
01:14:58,429 --> 01:15:00,290
[SPEAKER_06]: 37H and a half is felony charges.

321
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:18,703
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this allows us to suspend a student if they have a felony charge and their continued presence would have a substantial detrimental effect on the general welfare of the school and allows a principal to expel a student who's been convicted of a felony and their continued presence would have a substantial detrimental effect on the general welfare of the school.

322
01:15:20,264 --> 01:15:26,349
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, generally what's required is just notice to the student and the parent

323
01:15:26,938 --> 01:15:28,839
[SPEAKER_06]: that there's going to be a suspension.

324
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:38,441
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there is the right to appeal to the superintendent in writing if someone wanted to dispute that suspension or expulsion.

325
01:15:40,862 --> 01:15:45,263
[SPEAKER_06]: And so then we get into the 37H and three quarters bucket.

326
01:15:45,643 --> 01:15:47,964
[SPEAKER_06]: In this bucket, you cannot expel a student.

327
01:15:48,344 --> 01:15:50,205
[SPEAKER_06]: You can only suspend a student for at most

328
01:15:52,217 --> 01:15:53,878
[SPEAKER_06]: 90 school days in a school year.

329
01:15:53,898 --> 01:15:56,979
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is the everything else bucket.

330
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:15,748
[SPEAKER_06]: And so generally, except for emergency removals or in-school suspensions that have sort of their own set procedures, the general requirement for a suspension under 37H and three quarters is that families have to get notice of a hearing, they have a hearing, and then they get the notice of outcome.

331
01:16:16,448 --> 01:16:17,708
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the general framework.

332
01:16:17,748 --> 01:16:21,130
[SPEAKER_06]: The amount of procedure that's offered sort of depends on the length of the suspension,

333
01:16:21,597 --> 01:16:29,904
[SPEAKER_06]: with long-term suspensions requiring more rights and more procedure than a short-term suspension, so a suspension of less than 10 days.

334
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:42,914
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's the, no matter whether you're talking about a short-term suspension or a long-term suspension, that's the general framework for suspensions under 37H and three quarters, notice, hearing, and then notice of outcome.

335
01:16:44,575 --> 01:16:46,657
[SPEAKER_06]: There is an exception for emergency removals.

336
01:16:46,677 --> 01:16:48,238
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

337
01:16:50,341 --> 01:17:10,872
[SPEAKER_06]: If the student's continued presence poses a danger to persons or property, or materially and substantially disrupts the order of the school, then a principal or an assistant principal can remove the student without that sort of pattern of notice, hearing, opportunity, and outcome decision, and can remove them prior to the hearing.

338
01:17:10,932 --> 01:17:15,195
[SPEAKER_06]: But the suspension hearing has to be held within two days following the emergency removal.

339
01:17:15,675 --> 01:17:18,437
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, to emergency remove a student, it has to meet that standard.

340
01:17:19,397 --> 01:17:25,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Continued presence has to pose a danger to persons or property or materially and substantially disrupt the order of the school.

341
01:17:28,022 --> 01:17:33,625
[SPEAKER_06]: And whenever a school district engages in discipline, that's confidential student record information.

342
01:17:33,645 --> 01:17:48,593
[SPEAKER_06]: No third party, so members of the community, even teachers who don't need to know that for their job, other school staff that don't need to know it for their job, don't have access to that information.

343
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:53,866
[SPEAKER_06]: without specific informed written consent of the eligible student or the parent.

344
01:17:55,687 --> 01:18:05,572
[SPEAKER_06]: And so all that information has to be kept confidential under our student records regulations because discipline is sort of one of your quintessential student record information.

345
01:18:08,273 --> 01:18:09,814
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it for my presentation.

346
01:18:09,834 --> 01:18:14,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate everyone having me here.

347
01:18:14,316 --> 01:18:17,758
[SPEAKER_03]: McLaughlin?

348
01:18:25,017 --> 01:18:26,478
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, thank you for the information.

349
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:29,339
[SPEAKER_10]: There's helpful information here.

350
01:18:29,379 --> 01:18:42,565
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wanted to ask if the, to clarify if the 37H and a half and 37H and three quarter are specific to students with disability, or are there other items on here that are specific to students with disability?

351
01:18:43,578 --> 01:18:46,339
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing here that's specific to students with disabilities.

352
01:18:47,079 --> 01:18:54,161
[SPEAKER_06]: These procedures sort of don't change in terms of how we go about deciding whether to suspend a student if a student's with disability.

353
01:18:54,661 --> 01:19:00,262
[SPEAKER_06]: The difference for students with disability is in sort of the procedure.

354
01:19:00,903 --> 01:19:10,325
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an additional layer of procedure for students with disabilities that if we're talking about an exclusion of a student for over 10 school days, then we have to start having manifestation determinations.

355
01:19:10,715 --> 01:19:15,917
[SPEAKER_06]: which means that there's a meeting where people discuss whether the behavior is a manifestation of the disability.

356
01:19:15,997 --> 01:19:18,719
[SPEAKER_06]: And if it is, then you can't suspend the students.

357
01:19:21,780 --> 01:19:22,100
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

358
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:26,282
[SPEAKER_10]: So that manifestation hearing happens if there's a 10 day suspension, is that right?

359
01:19:26,302 --> 01:19:29,383
[SPEAKER_10]: It's if you get more than 10 days cumulatively.

360
01:19:30,144 --> 01:19:32,345
[SPEAKER_10]: Cumulatively over the year, it doesn't have to be consecutively.

361
01:19:32,505 --> 01:19:33,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct, yes.

362
01:19:34,185 --> 01:19:34,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

363
01:19:34,506 --> 01:19:39,908
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the manifestation hearing is a manifestation of whether their disability influenced the discipline.

364
01:19:40,944 --> 01:19:49,389
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the question is, was their conduct substantially related to their disability or was it due to our failure to implement either the IEP or the 504 plan?

365
01:19:49,889 --> 01:19:59,755
[SPEAKER_06]: If the answer is yes to either question, then the student has a right to return and we consider doing a functional behavior assessment or updating the behavior intervention plan.

366
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:00,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

367
01:20:01,016 --> 01:20:01,617
[SPEAKER_10]: That's super helpful.

368
01:20:01,637 --> 01:20:07,040
[SPEAKER_10]: I just want people to understand the nuances of the law, which obviously all law has nuance,

369
01:20:07,951 --> 01:20:09,232
[SPEAKER_10]: I really appreciate you mentioning that.

370
01:20:09,292 --> 01:20:09,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks so much.

371
01:20:10,133 --> 01:20:10,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, of course.

372
01:20:10,653 --> 01:20:10,973
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

373
01:20:14,055 --> 01:20:29,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Felicia if I may from the chair, with regards to the amount of days for suspensions is their standards out there I don't know if they're written in the law or is that fully the discretion of the principal and then appeal rights to the superintendent.

374
01:20:32,879 --> 01:20:36,200
[SPEAKER_06]: There's nothing in the law about how many days an administrator can spend.

375
01:20:36,220 --> 01:20:38,301
[SPEAKER_06]: That's within the discretion of the administrator.

376
01:20:38,321 --> 01:20:45,224
[SPEAKER_06]: And the right to appeal to the superintendent is for any long-term suspension.

377
01:20:45,264 --> 01:20:52,687
[SPEAKER_06]: So any suspension over 10 days cumulatively or consecutively, there is a right to appeal to the superintendent for a short-term suspension.

378
01:20:53,207 --> 01:20:54,427
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no right to appeal.

379
01:20:54,447 --> 01:20:56,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Got it.

380
01:20:57,569 --> 01:20:58,229
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thank you.

381
01:20:59,009 --> 01:20:59,809
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for being here.

382
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:01,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thank you for having me.

383
01:21:05,143 --> 01:21:15,627
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a report on 2023 Special Education Determination under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education, IDEA, Ms.

384
01:21:15,647 --> 01:21:17,848
[SPEAKER_11]: Joan Bowen, Director of Student Services.

385
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:22,810
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

386
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:31,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Tonight I will be reporting on the 2022-2023 determinations of need for special education technical assistance

387
01:21:31,577 --> 01:21:33,699
[SPEAKER_07]: or intervention from Medford Public Schools.

388
01:21:34,579 --> 01:21:54,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to give you a little background is under the Federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education must make annual determinations regarding local education agencies specific needs for technical assistance or intervention in special education.

389
01:21:55,296 --> 01:21:58,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And Massachusetts does so based on four categories.

390
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:00,320
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.

391
01:22:01,688 --> 01:22:10,602
[SPEAKER_07]: It's meet the four categories would be meets requirements needs assistance needs intervention or need substantial intervention.

392
01:22:11,624 --> 01:22:12,125
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.

393
01:22:14,324 --> 01:22:36,194
[SPEAKER_07]: So in making the 2022-23 LEA determination, the department assessed Medford Public Schools performance and compliance data, including data from the general accountability and assistance system, tiered focus monitoring process, state complaints, and state performance plan and our annual performance reports.

394
01:22:36,895 --> 01:22:43,578
[SPEAKER_07]: The rubric specifically considers the following, five-year cohort graduation rates for students with disabilities,

395
01:22:44,243 --> 01:23:13,038
[SPEAKER_07]: an annual dropout rate for students with disabilities, our public school monitoring special education compliance data, problem resolution system special education complaint data, performance on our special education state performance plan and our annual performance report based on indicators that we are identified in a cohort and we need to report on on a yearly basis, as well as data and findings of significant disproportionality.

396
01:23:13,943 --> 01:23:14,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide, please.

397
01:23:15,784 --> 01:23:23,870
[SPEAKER_07]: So each agency is evaluated using the rubric and based on the overall score placed into one of the LEA determination categories.

398
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:32,476
[SPEAKER_07]: As described in the determination rubric, final LEA determinations reflect both performance and compliance in special education.

399
01:23:33,877 --> 01:23:41,742
[SPEAKER_07]: This year, the five-year cohort graduation rate and least restrictive environments, which are indicators five and six, and I'll explain a little bit more at the end,

400
01:23:42,172 --> 01:23:45,295
[SPEAKER_07]: when I show you the graph of Medford specific results this year.

401
01:23:47,456 --> 01:23:55,683
[SPEAKER_07]: So they continue to be prioritized by the department and are weighted times 1.5 and times 2.0 respectively.

402
01:23:56,304 --> 01:24:03,450
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, points for problem resolution system complaints are calculated per a thousand students with disabilities.

403
01:24:04,551 --> 01:24:05,391
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide, please.

404
01:24:06,072 --> 01:24:07,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So Medford results.

405
01:24:07,253 --> 01:24:08,954
[SPEAKER_07]: So as a result of the 2022-2023 school year,

406
01:24:11,383 --> 01:24:18,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford Public Schools earned 23.5 out of 30 possible points on the rubric or 78.3%.

407
01:24:19,569 --> 01:24:25,153
[SPEAKER_07]: Last year, Medford Public School District earned 29 out of 36 possible points on the rubric or 80.6%.

408
01:24:28,295 --> 01:24:34,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford received an overall rating of meeting requirements, which is consistent to last year's rating.

409
01:24:34,738 --> 01:24:43,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, the department will not be providing targeted technical assistance or intervention in these LEAs based on the LEA determination.

410
01:24:43,303 --> 01:24:46,285
[SPEAKER_07]: So the last slide is the specific

411
01:24:47,305 --> 01:24:52,268
[SPEAKER_07]: indicators or information that the department looked at in regards to Medford.

412
01:24:52,769 --> 01:24:55,350
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first one is our annual dropout rate.

413
01:24:56,071 --> 01:24:59,933
[SPEAKER_07]: And Medford got a 3.4%, two out of four points.

414
01:25:00,774 --> 01:25:02,855
[SPEAKER_07]: This was a little bit different than last year.

415
01:25:03,376 --> 01:25:05,457
[SPEAKER_07]: We received 2% last year.

416
01:25:06,438 --> 01:25:11,741
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you look at when the annual dropout rate was, the information that they took, it was during the 2021 school year.

417
01:25:13,466 --> 01:25:16,027
[SPEAKER_07]: So that we had just returned from COVID.

418
01:25:16,407 --> 01:25:18,468
[SPEAKER_07]: It was the first school year back in session.

419
01:25:18,548 --> 01:25:24,750
[SPEAKER_07]: There were different cohorts coming in a time and it was difficulty getting students engaged in learning and back in school.

420
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:30,032
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just want people to take that under consideration when we're looking at the annual dropout rate.

421
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:34,734
[SPEAKER_07]: The five-year cohort graduation rate is indicator one.

422
01:25:35,754 --> 01:25:39,735
[SPEAKER_07]: And this score indicates that Medford is at or above the state's rate of 91%

423
01:25:42,265 --> 01:25:48,232
[SPEAKER_07]: for the five-year cohort graduation rate for students with disabilities compared to last year's rate, which was 83.9%.

424
01:25:50,635 --> 01:25:53,018
[SPEAKER_07]: So this year we're at 87%.

425
01:25:53,058 --> 01:26:00,307
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have an increase in the students and our five-year cohort graduation rate, which is an improvement from the previous year.

426
01:26:01,992 --> 01:26:06,056
[SPEAKER_07]: The next is the public school monitoring compliance.

427
01:26:06,577 --> 01:26:13,485
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is through the problem resolution system and this is through Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

428
01:26:14,386 --> 01:26:18,751
[SPEAKER_07]: And what happens is parents, caregivers,

429
01:26:19,511 --> 01:26:30,254
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, they can file a complaint with P. R. S. And what P. R. S. Looks at is if the local agency has violated education law regulations or compliance.

430
01:26:30,774 --> 01:26:38,557
[SPEAKER_07]: They take a look at the complaint and then they will provide the district with a letter of finding that we need to do an internal investigation.

431
01:26:38,897 --> 01:26:42,418
[SPEAKER_07]: We may need to provide documentation on what we did

432
01:26:43,258 --> 01:26:49,280
[SPEAKER_07]: to prove that we were in compliance, we provide that all to DESE, and then they make a final determination.

433
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:55,522
[SPEAKER_07]: So last year, Medford Public Schools did have 12 PRS complaints, and it was a wide range.

434
01:26:55,922 --> 01:27:05,946
[SPEAKER_07]: It could have been from parents feeling that their students weren't receiving the appropriate level of services, or there was a bullying report, things like that.

435
01:27:05,986 --> 01:27:07,466
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is a wide range.

436
01:27:07,866 --> 01:27:09,027
[SPEAKER_07]: So based on those,

437
01:27:10,588 --> 01:27:22,468
[SPEAKER_07]: 12 PRS complaints, there were two that no formal action was taken to that there was a letter of withdrawal that the teams were able to meet and have a team meeting and resolve the issue before it had to go any further.

438
01:27:23,937 --> 01:27:35,502
[SPEAKER_07]: There were five no findings of non compliance so each of those let Medford know that we met the, we were following regulations and compliance and the law in regards to those complaints.

439
01:27:36,242 --> 01:27:41,765
[SPEAKER_07]: There was one finding of non compliance, and that resulted in the district doing a corrective action

440
01:27:42,865 --> 01:27:59,675
[SPEAKER_07]: And what happens is you look at what the complaint is, where we were found to not be in compliant and offer some professional development to staff to review that law regulation, and then to do some in-district monitoring to make sure that we don't do that again in the future.

441
01:28:00,095 --> 01:28:09,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And they will look for that documentation over the course of the year to make sure that we're following through on what that issue may have been that we were found in non-compliance.

442
01:28:10,915 --> 01:28:15,158
[SPEAKER_07]: And two, we are still waiting to hear decisions from PRS.

443
01:28:17,740 --> 01:28:24,685
[SPEAKER_07]: They have probably 98 complaints that they're working on, and typically they may have like 68, but every day they're getting more and more.

444
01:28:24,725 --> 01:28:28,408
[SPEAKER_07]: So the process is taking a little longer to get the results of those two.

445
01:28:29,651 --> 01:28:37,093
[SPEAKER_07]: So the score of three indicates that there were one to 2.9 letters of finding issued per 1,000 students with disabilities.

446
01:28:37,613 --> 01:28:42,054
[SPEAKER_07]: This year's score was a 2.4 compared to last year's score of three.

447
01:28:43,475 --> 01:28:49,436
[SPEAKER_07]: The next three indicators are indicators 4B, nine and 10.

448
01:28:50,516 --> 01:28:53,597
[SPEAKER_07]: 4B is regarding suspensions and expulsions.

449
01:28:53,737 --> 01:28:55,498
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's the percentage of Medfords

450
01:28:57,726 --> 01:29:02,528
[SPEAKER_07]: if there's a significant discrepancy by race and ethnicity.

451
01:29:03,489 --> 01:29:08,591
[SPEAKER_07]: The next one is indicator nine, which is disproportionate representation.

452
01:29:09,051 --> 01:29:17,335
[SPEAKER_07]: So they look at the percentage of districts with disproportionate representation of racial ethnic groups due to inappropriate identification.

453
01:29:17,355 --> 01:29:25,098
[SPEAKER_07]: And then indicator 10 is also a disproportionate representation in specific disability categories.

454
01:29:25,646 --> 01:29:35,453
[SPEAKER_07]: So the percentage of districts with disproportionate representation of racial ethnic groups in a specific disability category due to inappropriate identification.

455
01:29:36,594 --> 01:29:45,161
[SPEAKER_07]: These three indicators received a score of four, which indicates that there are no compliance findings, which is also consistent with last year's performance.

456
01:29:46,662 --> 01:29:54,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Indicator five, this is our percentage of students with IEPs, ages five and enrolled in a kindergarten,

457
01:29:55,943 --> 01:30:11,248
[SPEAKER_07]: ages six to 21 who are served either inside regular class 80% or more of the day, either inside regular class less than 40% of the day, or see in separate schools, residential facilities or homebound hospital placements.

458
01:30:11,968 --> 01:30:19,271
[SPEAKER_07]: And indicator six is the percentage of children with IEPs ages three, four and five who are enrolled in a preschool program.

459
01:30:20,301 --> 01:30:29,624
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is A, they receive majority of special education and related services in regular early childhood programs, which is similar to our MEET program.

460
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:35,987
[SPEAKER_07]: B, they attend separate special education class, separate school or a residential facility.

461
01:30:36,587 --> 01:30:40,829
[SPEAKER_07]: And C, that they receive special education and related services in the home.

462
01:30:41,709 --> 01:30:48,251
[SPEAKER_07]: The percentage of students falling in these categories was 68.5% compared to last year when it was 66.2%.

463
01:30:50,345 --> 01:30:54,527
[SPEAKER_07]: indicating that more students were found eligible in the course of this year.

464
01:30:54,907 --> 01:30:59,649
[SPEAKER_07]: And that information was also taken from the 2021-22 school year.

465
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:04,470
[SPEAKER_07]: And lastly is the significant disproportionality data.

466
01:31:07,191 --> 01:31:14,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Both from the school year, 21-22 and 22-23 indicates that there is no status in either one of those.

467
01:31:14,654 --> 01:31:16,235
[SPEAKER_07]: So we are found to be,

468
01:31:16,663 --> 01:31:21,228
[SPEAKER_07]: four out of four points or compliant in that matter as in that area as well.

469
01:31:21,949 --> 01:31:22,650
[SPEAKER_07]: In your packets.

470
01:31:22,690 --> 01:31:32,420
[SPEAKER_07]: I've also included the chart of indicators that the school district may be asked to provide Jesse with information throughout the school year.

471
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:38,487
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's also a frequently asked question as well as the letter that Medford did receive from

472
01:31:39,438 --> 01:31:40,959
[SPEAKER_07]: Desi regarding these findings.

473
01:31:41,059 --> 01:31:46,882
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to let you know that the graph was cut off, and that's why I put it at the end of the PowerPoint.

474
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:54,825
[SPEAKER_07]: You couldn't see the last column regarding significant disproportionate, sorry, disproportionality data.

475
01:31:55,846 --> 01:31:56,686
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the report.

476
01:31:56,706 --> 01:32:00,208
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anyone has any specific questions in regards to that.

477
01:32:00,228 --> 01:32:01,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.

478
01:32:01,969 --> 01:32:02,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Member McLaughlin.

479
01:32:03,229 --> 01:32:03,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

480
01:32:04,350 --> 01:32:05,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Ms.

481
01:32:05,991 --> 01:32:06,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Bowen.

482
01:32:06,271 --> 01:32:08,552
[SPEAKER_10]: I know this is a lot of work to put together.

483
01:32:09,131 --> 01:32:29,967
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not obviously the coordinated program review this is the annual le a correct so we it's it's Ted focus monitoring now so there's no longer the correct morning yeah yeah it's yeah so we had done that they love to change that they do they just so you see FM and that was last year where we yeah right yeah and that's the every three year one and yes the annual.

484
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:31,171
[SPEAKER_10]: to differentiate.

485
01:32:31,331 --> 01:32:31,971
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

486
01:32:32,031 --> 01:32:35,294
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the indicators, those are the SPP APR indicators.

487
01:32:35,314 --> 01:32:36,395
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that what you're talking about?

488
01:32:36,415 --> 01:32:36,555
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

489
01:32:36,775 --> 01:32:37,215
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

490
01:32:37,596 --> 01:32:46,863
[SPEAKER_10]: Would it be possible, and if not, I can go online and get it if you're not, or if your staff's not available, but would it be possible to get a list of the indicators, just indicators one through nine?

491
01:32:46,983 --> 01:32:48,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I did, I included that in the packet.

492
01:32:48,664 --> 01:32:49,044
[SPEAKER_07]: Where is that?

493
01:32:49,084 --> 01:32:50,586
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's a single sheet.

494
01:32:51,366 --> 01:32:52,567
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just get it for you.

495
01:32:54,188 --> 01:32:54,669
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have it?

496
01:32:56,790 --> 01:32:58,912
[SPEAKER_10]: So it looks like this, it says IVC.

497
01:32:58,932 --> 01:33:00,193
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, thank you.

498
01:33:00,836 --> 01:33:02,477
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's, thank you, that's super helpful.

499
01:33:03,037 --> 01:33:13,882
[SPEAKER_10]: And so those are all, yeah, looking at, those are all the indicators that the state looks at in terms of the special education.

500
01:33:14,743 --> 01:33:17,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct, but we're not responsible for all of them every single year.

501
01:33:17,964 --> 01:33:20,926
[SPEAKER_07]: We're putting a cohort and there are specific indicators

502
01:33:21,316 --> 01:33:25,098
[SPEAKER_07]: that we have to report on at the beginning of the school year and at the end of the school year.

503
01:33:25,138 --> 01:33:32,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So indicator seven is one of those, indicator 14, but we have to input this information and that's what DESE looks at.

504
01:33:33,283 --> 01:33:37,005
[SPEAKER_10]: So do they randomize what indicators that we report on at the beginning and the end?

505
01:33:37,025 --> 01:33:38,045
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they different or are they?

506
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:47,751
[SPEAKER_07]: So no, it's at the start of the school year, we may look at preschool enrollment and then we look at the end of the school year, how many students were found eligible,

507
01:33:48,325 --> 01:33:54,649
[SPEAKER_07]: ages three, four, and five, and we need to make sure that they were found eligible before their third birthday and that they were receiving services.

508
01:33:54,689 --> 01:34:00,192
[SPEAKER_07]: So they look at that and then transition, it's post-secondary outcomes.

509
01:34:00,272 --> 01:34:13,341
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have to follow up for three years with students who are on IEPs as to, you know, when they graduated, what they're doing now, if they're, you know, if they started in college, are they continuing?

510
01:34:13,361 --> 01:34:14,741
[SPEAKER_07]: And they look at that data as well.

511
01:34:14,902 --> 01:34:17,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so if I understand you correctly, you're saying that

512
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:28,043
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a randomized indicator list that you get at the beginning of the year that tell you what indicators your cohorts going to be responsible for reporting on correct have the 17 indicators that there are.

513
01:34:28,404 --> 01:34:32,385
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you get to annually that you report no currently we have.

514
01:34:34,064 --> 01:34:37,506
[SPEAKER_07]: three this year, but it varies every year.

515
01:34:37,606 --> 01:34:38,427
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah.

516
01:34:38,967 --> 01:34:50,954
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be great if maybe at the beginning of the year, if we could know what the three are, if you wouldn't mind letting us know in the beginning of the year what the three are that are being reported on so we can kind of keep an eye on those.

517
01:34:51,294 --> 01:34:57,057
[SPEAKER_10]: I can actually show you the schedule of what it looks like and what the activities are that we're responsible throughout the year.

518
01:34:57,157 --> 01:34:57,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, that would be awesome.

519
01:34:57,958 --> 01:34:58,278
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

520
01:34:58,338 --> 01:35:01,420
[SPEAKER_10]: And then what was the other thing I was going to ask you?

521
01:35:02,135 --> 01:35:09,757
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, and thank you for the breakdown on the public school monitoring compliance in terms of the PRS complaints, that's super helpful.

522
01:35:10,137 --> 01:35:14,438
[SPEAKER_10]: We've asked PRS for that data in the past, and it's been a little bit trickier to get, so it's nice to hear it from you.

523
01:35:15,598 --> 01:35:16,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Much appreciated.

524
01:35:17,218 --> 01:35:27,060
[SPEAKER_10]: And then regarding 504 and OCR, were there any, so Office of Civil Rights complaint or the procedural safeguards for 504, but also students with IEPs.

525
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:30,561
[SPEAKER_10]: So I know there was the public school monitoring, was there any OCR complaints?

526
01:35:30,681 --> 01:35:31,221
[SPEAKER_10]: No, there were not.

527
01:35:31,361 --> 01:35:31,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

528
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:32,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

529
01:35:33,001 --> 01:35:34,603
[SPEAKER_10]: And then a 78.3%.

530
01:35:36,245 --> 01:35:44,635
[SPEAKER_10]: And certainly while there's, you know, there's been lots of great things that have been happening, I don't know what the great equivalent is just not being a teacher and having had a report card myself a little while.

531
01:35:45,916 --> 01:35:48,179
[SPEAKER_10]: What would a 78.3% be a great equivalent, I would say, maybe.

532
01:35:51,436 --> 01:35:54,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna go with a B minus or a C plus.

533
01:35:55,017 --> 01:36:05,500
[SPEAKER_07]: There is room for improvement and I would like to see that number higher, but they did change some of the criteria and how they, like the times 2.0, that was different this year.

534
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:05,700
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

535
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:17,563
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you could generalize with a B minus or a C plus, if you were talking to your student or somebody, you know, your child and you were saying, okay, what, you know, you did okay, but let's think about what the room for improvement is and what can we work on?

536
01:36:18,144 --> 01:36:19,144
[SPEAKER_10]: What would you say those things?

537
01:36:20,191 --> 01:36:39,740
[SPEAKER_07]: I would want to know why, you know, high school dropout rates have increased a little bit like what is the root cause of that and then what sort of strategy, what can we implement, you know, we have engagement specialists, how do we, you know, use them more to is it is it school for like what's the root cause of why students aren't finishing school.

538
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:41,381
[SPEAKER_07]: attendance?

539
01:36:41,541 --> 01:36:43,242
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it social emotional needs?

540
01:36:43,342 --> 01:36:46,985
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I think there's a bigger picture that we need to look at.

541
01:36:47,005 --> 01:36:53,389
[SPEAKER_07]: But that based on this information that I got last week, I'd like to do a deeper dive into that we can drill down into.

542
01:36:53,450 --> 01:36:54,250
[SPEAKER_10]: And then thank you.

543
01:36:54,270 --> 01:37:01,295
[SPEAKER_10]: And then just one last thing there was what was the other one that was the 68.5% to six out of eight.

544
01:37:01,856 --> 01:37:04,538
[SPEAKER_10]: So one was the two out of four, which is the annual dropout rate.

545
01:37:04,558 --> 01:37:10,162
[SPEAKER_10]: The other one was the six out of eight, which was the indicators five and six, which is my indicator cheat sheet.

546
01:37:10,580 --> 01:37:13,421
[SPEAKER_10]: Five and six are educational environments and preschool environment, right?

547
01:37:13,561 --> 01:37:13,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

548
01:37:14,381 --> 01:37:24,245
[SPEAKER_10]: So educational environment or percentage of children with IEPs, five and six served inside regular class, 80% or more inside regular class, less than 40%.

549
01:37:24,786 --> 01:37:25,926
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's the inclusion rate.

550
01:37:26,646 --> 01:37:27,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

551
01:37:27,107 --> 01:37:28,067
[SPEAKER_07]: In general.

552
01:37:28,147 --> 01:37:32,088
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's also looking at students who are also in out of district programming.

553
01:37:32,108 --> 01:37:33,189
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's three different.

554
01:37:33,349 --> 01:37:34,730
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah, I see the criteria.

555
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:35,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

556
01:37:35,810 --> 01:37:38,431
[SPEAKER_10]: So is that saying that there's room for improvement

557
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:39,751
[SPEAKER_10]: on our inclusion data?

558
01:37:40,071 --> 01:37:40,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely.

559
01:37:41,052 --> 01:37:41,412
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

560
01:37:42,013 --> 01:37:42,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

561
01:37:42,713 --> 01:37:43,154
[SPEAKER_10]: Super helpful.

562
01:37:43,694 --> 01:37:44,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Rousseau?

563
01:37:44,735 --> 01:37:45,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

564
01:37:46,597 --> 01:37:47,738
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a lot to digest.

565
01:37:48,418 --> 01:37:59,648
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my first question is, well, we just heard that the things that are being measured change every year.

566
01:38:00,649 --> 01:38:04,072
[SPEAKER_05]: So my question around is this data available online?

567
01:38:05,092 --> 01:38:06,093
[SPEAKER_05]: It is, it is.

568
01:38:06,173 --> 01:38:11,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I can actually send you the link if you'd like to, and you can see the reports from previous years.

569
01:38:11,357 --> 01:38:17,162
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you can't, I have them, I get them in a letter and I would be willing to share those with you so you can take a look at it.

570
01:38:17,323 --> 01:38:17,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

571
01:38:17,923 --> 01:38:30,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I mean, some of these things, two out of four sounds like a 50%, but if the average for the state is one out of four, then two out of four looks good.

572
01:38:30,494 --> 01:38:32,336
[SPEAKER_05]: If the average for the state is three out of four,

573
01:38:33,731 --> 01:38:36,693
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so this is all on Desi's website.

574
01:38:36,833 --> 01:38:38,414
[SPEAKER_07]: They sent us the link.

575
01:38:38,434 --> 01:38:41,676
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be in the letter there, but I can get that for you for sure.

576
01:38:41,756 --> 01:38:42,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

577
01:38:44,157 --> 01:38:47,199
[SPEAKER_05]: The post-graduation outcomes.

578
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:51,141
[SPEAKER_05]: We had talked about that, I don't know, a few years ago.

579
01:38:51,322 --> 01:38:52,882
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's before the pandemic, it seems.

580
01:38:53,003 --> 01:39:01,788
[SPEAKER_05]: But about how hard it was, it was in response to a series, I don't know if it was,

581
01:39:03,064 --> 01:39:26,443
[SPEAKER_05]: some podcast series around how first-generation kids, especially kids of color, okay, Siri thinks I wanna talk to Siri, who would go to college and then the dropout rate was through the roof as a freshman in college because they were not prepared, they had no understanding of what college was like.

582
01:39:27,664 --> 01:39:30,747
[SPEAKER_05]: And when we talked about that here about,

583
01:39:32,387 --> 01:39:55,674
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, how do we figure out what are we doing, what we need to do to make sure that when they leave and go to college, because we have a big sort of like almost a celebration every year about who's going where, but, you know, celebrating a kid going off to Bentley and then, you know, three months in they quit, even though they were a straight A student at Medford High, you know, there's a story there.

584
01:39:57,522 --> 01:40:00,243
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, how do we make sure we're preparing them?

585
01:40:00,263 --> 01:40:04,245
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realized like, we can't be responsible for the kids for the rest of their lives.

586
01:40:04,725 --> 01:40:15,868
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's limits, but the ability to understand what happens to kids once they've left was something that was sort of like, not possible.

587
01:40:17,269 --> 01:40:21,130
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm seeing in this measurement is that you have to do that.

588
01:40:21,810 --> 01:40:23,211
[SPEAKER_05]: For students with disabilities.

589
01:40:23,291 --> 01:40:23,971
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's right.

590
01:40:24,051 --> 01:40:24,411
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

591
01:40:24,531 --> 01:40:24,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

592
01:40:26,012 --> 01:40:26,372
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you

593
01:40:28,310 --> 01:40:41,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, are you like literally like harassing them with phone calls and letters phone calls emails letters yes so we try to get three different types of communication from them and then we check that when we call them every year to make sure it's still accurate.

594
01:40:42,873 --> 01:40:49,235
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes they still have connections to the guidance counselors or someone at school so we try to update it and then we do send letters home as well.

595
01:40:49,675 --> 01:40:51,675
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had a pretty good response.

596
01:40:55,445 --> 01:41:00,746
[SPEAKER_07]: We try to put things specifically in place all year long up to there right before they graduate.

597
01:41:00,786 --> 01:41:04,827
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have this form for every student that's ready to go.

598
01:41:05,027 --> 01:41:07,187
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we follow up with it the following year.

599
01:41:07,867 --> 01:41:14,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Numbers change, things like that, but we haven't had a lot of mail return to us and the students will reply.

600
01:41:14,128 --> 01:41:21,890
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's like a survey that they can fill out if they don't, sometimes they see Medford Public Schools and they won't answer their cell phone, but they will respond to a letter.

601
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:24,430
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we try different means

602
01:41:24,909 --> 01:41:26,670
[SPEAKER_07]: to make sure that we get that information.

603
01:41:27,610 --> 01:41:32,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And how heavy of a lift is that for your staff?

604
01:41:33,472 --> 01:41:36,253
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm gonna say we have three ETLs.

605
01:41:36,293 --> 01:41:42,455
[SPEAKER_07]: We're lucky we have three evaluation team leaders at the high school level and they work closely with the families and that's part of their job.

606
01:41:42,875 --> 01:41:43,215
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

607
01:41:43,475 --> 01:41:44,976
[SPEAKER_07]: So they know it's a requirement.

608
01:41:44,996 --> 01:41:49,698
[SPEAKER_07]: They work when they're at the high school level, that this is an activity that we need to do on a yearly basis.

609
01:41:49,758 --> 01:41:53,319
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's sort of where I see is the gap is that there are staff

610
01:41:54,569 --> 01:41:57,350
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not teachers are not guidance counselors like this is their job.

611
01:41:57,870 --> 01:41:59,551
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is part of their job.

612
01:42:00,511 --> 01:42:10,255
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, for instance, to find a way to have all the kids be getting these calls and letters, even if it was every year every five years so we could get some sense.

613
01:42:11,174 --> 01:42:13,476
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no staff to do it because there's nobody whose job it is.

614
01:42:13,776 --> 01:42:14,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

615
01:42:14,197 --> 01:42:14,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, thank you.

616
01:42:15,057 --> 01:42:26,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I just was trying to figure out how do we make it work there but we couldn't figure it out and the rest of the school and I mean Jesse also provided us with a lot of guidance on how to do it forms the standard forms things like that.

617
01:42:26,887 --> 01:42:27,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

618
01:42:27,688 --> 01:42:33,433
[SPEAKER_05]: And my last question is, you know, when I first came on the school committee in 2018.

619
01:42:35,895 --> 01:42:37,456
[SPEAKER_05]: DESE had just done this whole thing.

620
01:42:37,476 --> 01:42:42,639
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it was the federal government, I forget who, around dropout rates was the biggest thing.

621
01:42:42,659 --> 01:42:43,359
[SPEAKER_05]: It was DESE.

622
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:48,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And so then suddenly dropout rates was everything in our report card.

623
01:42:48,683 --> 01:42:52,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And just like that, voila, dropout rates dropped to the floor across the state.

624
01:42:54,106 --> 01:43:00,269
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course, it's questionable whether that was accurate.

625
01:43:01,785 --> 01:43:14,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Whenever I see dropouts, I have to ask the question, are there, for this one, not necessarily for the rest of the student population, are there very strict protocols for determining whether a student is considered dropped out?

626
01:43:14,331 --> 01:43:25,697
[SPEAKER_05]: And I ask that because, look, students' families move and they don't feel inspired to respond to MPS, because now they live in Colorado, or they go back to another country or move to a country.

627
01:43:25,717 --> 01:43:29,439
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just all these ways in which a student drops off our radar.

628
01:43:32,523 --> 01:43:38,245
[SPEAKER_05]: many times they're not dropping out, but we don't know which way it is for a lot of students.

629
01:43:38,445 --> 01:43:47,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm just wondering for this particular measurement, are there very strict things where we don't get to make a judgment call or do we get to make a judgment call?

630
01:43:47,268 --> 01:43:53,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, oh, I knew that kid, John, and I know that his family left and they didn't fill any forms out, but I know they moved to New Hampshire.

631
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:56,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a more formalized process with students with disabilities.

632
01:43:57,011 --> 01:44:01,753
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a process to send out after 10 days of absence, there's a letter that goes out to the families.

633
01:44:02,046 --> 01:44:05,228
[SPEAKER_07]: But we also say that we want to have a team meeting at that time to discuss.

634
01:44:05,268 --> 01:44:13,992
[SPEAKER_07]: So we bring the family in sometimes with the student to talk about what's going on, why are they not coming to school, and what are options for them.

635
01:44:14,512 --> 01:44:16,914
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we officially unenroll them.

636
01:44:17,274 --> 01:44:21,616
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is a process, but there are students that do fall through the cracks.

637
01:44:21,656 --> 01:44:23,817
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do try to get in touch with them.

638
01:44:23,877 --> 01:44:25,118
[SPEAKER_07]: We reach out to the families.

639
01:44:25,499 --> 01:44:27,720
[SPEAKER_07]: But sometimes we don't always hear back from the families.

640
01:44:27,901 --> 01:44:30,702
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't know if they've moved to a different state, that sort of thing.

641
01:44:30,742 --> 01:44:34,365
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do do the meetings to talk about what are different options.

642
01:44:34,405 --> 01:44:42,090
[SPEAKER_07]: And there are some students that just are 18 and they would like to do the high set or something like that, which is the new GED.

643
01:44:43,330 --> 01:44:45,652
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a conversation that takes place during that time.

644
01:44:46,332 --> 01:44:52,493
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but I mean, I'm assuming somewhere in school brain, somebody has to code a student as being dropped out.

645
01:44:52,993 --> 01:44:56,634
[SPEAKER_07]: We do on our state reporting for students with disabilities.

646
01:44:56,814 --> 01:45:04,475
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to indicate that on our EZIEP and we have to put down that they had dropped out and the reasons why.

647
01:45:04,495 --> 01:45:08,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but if you don't have any reasons, John disappeared.

648
01:45:09,836 --> 01:45:13,077
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you may, if John literally disappears, you may call DCF or something.

649
01:45:13,197 --> 01:45:14,577
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, there's a different process.

650
01:45:16,445 --> 01:45:19,427
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, students talking to their teachers, oh, we're moving to Colorado.

651
01:45:20,807 --> 01:45:24,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they moved to Colorado.

652
01:45:24,509 --> 01:45:27,771
[SPEAKER_07]: But then the school district has to reach out to us for their records.

653
01:45:27,891 --> 01:45:31,413
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's how we can... When they land somewhere else, they reach out to us.

654
01:45:31,473 --> 01:45:39,818
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they do reach out, especially if it's a student with disability or on a 504, they wanna know, they wanna have, you know, their previous evaluations, their IEP, that sort of thing.

655
01:45:40,127 --> 01:45:45,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so do you feel pretty confident that our determination of a student dropping out is pretty robust?

656
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:46,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.

657
01:45:46,530 --> 01:45:48,491
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not allowed to use that word as a politician, sorry.

658
01:45:49,011 --> 01:45:51,012
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, good, that's good to hear.

659
01:45:51,133 --> 01:45:59,237
[SPEAKER_05]: I just worry that once we start measuring something, suddenly everybody, the measurement changes once you start looking at it.

660
01:45:59,457 --> 01:46:02,518
[SPEAKER_05]: I forget that physics law, but all right.

661
01:46:03,299 --> 01:46:06,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, this is really great information and I look forward to it.

662
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't wait to look online.

663
01:46:07,881 --> 01:46:09,342
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'll send you the link tomorrow.

664
01:46:10,703 --> 01:46:12,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin, I just have one more question.

665
01:46:12,645 --> 01:46:12,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

666
01:46:13,966 --> 01:46:17,329
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to know about guidance when we get guidance from OSAP or from DESE.

667
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:24,955
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I know that there was the disability guidance, I mean, the discipline guidance that we had over the summer from OSAP.

668
01:46:24,995 --> 01:46:35,424
[SPEAKER_10]: There's just different letters that come out from the Office of Special Education Planning and Policy and from DESE as a whole in terms of disability related issues across the country.

669
01:46:36,128 --> 01:46:37,989
[SPEAKER_10]: but that are specific to our state as well.

670
01:46:38,069 --> 01:46:40,729
[SPEAKER_10]: How does that information get distributed from your office?

671
01:46:41,109 --> 01:46:47,511
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a monthly special ed directors meetings that I attend through DESE, so we get a lot of the updates then.

672
01:46:47,611 --> 01:46:50,772
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I meet with my coordinators on a weekly basis.

673
01:46:50,952 --> 01:47:01,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I call it my slate meeting, and that's when I update them on any new guidance that comes down and how it's going to impact the special education students in our district.

674
01:47:01,995 --> 01:47:02,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

675
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:12,083
[SPEAKER_10]: Does the general education population teachers get any of that guidance information or does that come strictly to the tails and disseminate from them.

676
01:47:12,563 --> 01:47:27,549
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would, it would depend on what the new guidance is and and who are the people that really need to be informed so if it's new discipline we would want principals assistant principal assistant principals curriculum, you know, as many people involved in that and and that's what we did do.

677
01:47:28,407 --> 01:47:33,328
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it just depends on what the guidance is and who really is going to be impacted by the changes.

678
01:47:40,489 --> 01:47:41,649
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

679
01:47:51,131 --> 01:47:57,312
[SPEAKER_11]: We have our last report report on labor update, Mr. David Murphy, assistant superintendent of finance and operations.

680
01:47:59,474 --> 01:47:59,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mayor.

681
01:48:00,175 --> 01:48:18,457
[SPEAKER_00]: At the last committee meeting I updated you letting you know that the bargaining units who have reached resolution with respect to the successor agreements received their FY 22 retroactive compensation, and I believe I mentioned that we were working on the FY 23.

682
01:48:20,220 --> 01:48:24,962
[SPEAKER_00]: compensation, which would be retroactive from July 1st for the five agreements that we've reached.

683
01:48:25,643 --> 01:48:29,584
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do anticipate that that will take place this week during this current pay period.

684
01:48:31,025 --> 01:48:34,767
[SPEAKER_00]: There really isn't any other substantive updates, so I'm happy to answer your questions.

685
01:48:35,107 --> 01:48:44,931
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess just one caveat I would put on my comments from a moment ago is that there's always troubleshooting with respect to these implementation of agreements that are affecting hundreds of people.

686
01:48:47,344 --> 01:48:53,267
[SPEAKER_00]: If you happen to be an individual who has an issue that we need to do some troubleshooting on, you're happy to be watching and see them.

687
01:48:53,748 --> 01:48:56,149
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let you know that we'll be working on that in the coming days and weeks.

791
01:50:40,650 --> 01:50:46,073
[SPEAKER_11]: so that students with disabilities are provided access to post-secondary education and a college life.

792
01:50:46,693 --> 01:51:00,600
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved this body recognizes our Mass State representative, Sean Garvalli, for his commitment to persons with disabilities and to his passion to eradicate ableism through a formal letter from this body recognizing Rep.

793
01:51:00,640 --> 01:51:01,380
[SPEAKER_11]: Garvalli's work.

794
01:51:02,020 --> 01:51:07,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it further resolved that the MAI-CEI initiative is recognized in our public school district as part of

795
01:51:08,895 --> 01:51:14,937
[SPEAKER_11]: our high school transition program offered by a member of McLaughlin on the 17th, which is today.

796
01:51:14,957 --> 01:51:17,038
[SPEAKER_11]: It was requested to be on the agenda.

797
01:51:17,278 --> 01:51:17,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

798
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:20,259
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

799
01:51:20,619 --> 01:51:21,780
[SPEAKER_10]: No, this wasn't offered.

800
01:51:22,040 --> 01:51:22,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

801
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:22,860
[SPEAKER_10]: That was great.

802
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:24,821
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's a typo.

803
01:51:24,841 --> 01:51:26,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to make note of it is college life.

804
01:51:26,722 --> 01:51:28,603
[SPEAKER_10]: I see that you recognize that, so thank you.

805
01:51:28,623 --> 01:51:31,444
[SPEAKER_10]: That could be reflected and fixed in the minutes.

806
01:51:32,124 --> 01:51:32,824
[SPEAKER_10]: That would be great.

807
01:51:33,824 --> 01:51:37,166
[SPEAKER_10]: And as the superintendent was saying earlier, this is a landmark.

808
01:51:38,271 --> 01:51:43,475
[SPEAKER_10]: Legislation that representative Garber Lee was a key.

809
01:51:43,535 --> 01:51:52,201
[SPEAKER_10]: driver in the macy legislation so macy is mass inclusive concurrent enrollment program and.

810
01:51:53,542 --> 01:51:57,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Sean has just really represented Garber Lee has just really been pushing this uphill for several years.

811
01:51:58,233 --> 01:52:15,425
[SPEAKER_10]: And as stated for our students that don't achieve MCAS passing on the 10th grade MCAS, which is a requirement for a high school diploma, this allows them to go to post-secondary education and for their, not to be impeded by their disability to do that.

812
01:52:15,465 --> 01:52:23,650
[SPEAKER_10]: So these students can attend college life and be part of a college campus and all those things that are afforded to students without disabilities.

813
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:25,511
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a big, big deal for,

814
01:52:27,827 --> 01:52:29,789
[SPEAKER_10]: families and students with disabilities.

815
01:52:29,829 --> 01:52:36,274
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to publicly recognize Representative Garber for the work through a formal letter that can come from the superintendent's office.

816
01:52:36,314 --> 01:52:39,877
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm happy to help you compose the letter if you feel that there's a need for that.

817
01:52:40,637 --> 01:52:43,279
[SPEAKER_10]: But something that's just formally recognizing is really important.

818
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:52,787
[SPEAKER_10]: And then also the resolution that the Macy initiative is recognized in our public school district as part of our high school transition program, which I know that that's been the case.

819
01:52:53,777 --> 01:53:02,119
[SPEAKER_10]: As it was being formed and before it was actually law when it was just the inclusive concurrent enrollment program it was called ice at the time.

820
01:53:03,119 --> 01:53:10,661
[SPEAKER_10]: But I know that it's state law i'm sure that it will be part of the transition program I just want to make sure that it's recognized it such by this body.

821
01:53:11,921 --> 01:53:15,862
[SPEAKER_10]: So if I could have a motion to approve, I would appreciate it motion to approve.

822
01:53:16,373 --> 01:53:16,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

823

833

834
01:53:46,441 --> 01:53:50,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Two, does the Metro Public Schools have curricula from Lucy Culkins?

835
01:53:50,865 --> 01:53:54,868
[SPEAKER_11]: Three, are we purchasing any reading curriculum that uses the three queuing system?

836
01:53:55,589 --> 01:54:01,193
[SPEAKER_11]: Four, how many minutes per day are our K through three elementary teachers spending on phonics with the entire classroom?

837
01:54:01,874 --> 01:54:06,018
[SPEAKER_11]: What percentage of our K through three teachers are receiving training in phonics instruction?

838
01:54:06,778 --> 01:54:11,983
[SPEAKER_11]: Six, have our teachers been taught that using alternatives such as three queuing is harmful to students?

839
01:54:13,254 --> 01:54:24,586
[SPEAKER_11]: And seven, what is the plan for ensuring every single elementary school teacher current and newly hired is aware of the science of reading and that use of the three queuing system is harmful and should not be used with our students.

840
01:54:27,449 --> 01:54:27,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Roussel.

841
01:54:28,348 --> 01:54:28,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mayor.

842
01:54:29,409 --> 01:54:33,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the report request is self explanatory.

843
01:54:34,292 --> 01:54:44,159
[SPEAKER_05]: This is in response to multiple podcasts through from American public media that has really gone deep into

844
01:54:45,360 --> 01:54:58,191
[SPEAKER_05]: the state of reading in American public schools and the lack of science that drives the majority of the reading curricula that is used in virtually all schools, even though the

845
01:55:01,518 --> 01:55:16,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's MRIs that were able to show back in the early late 60s that in fact students do not learn to read the way that they're being taught and that the way they're being taught to read is in fact detrimental and harmful to

846
01:55:17,627 --> 01:55:20,289
[SPEAKER_05]: the average and the weaker of the readers.

847
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:28,616
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to get an understanding and lay of the land and what is going on in Medford in these specific areas.

848
01:55:28,796 --> 01:55:35,642
[SPEAKER_05]: And then obviously based on the results, we would probably have to have more conversations.

849
01:55:36,522 --> 01:55:42,867
[SPEAKER_05]: But I felt like this is a good starting point since I can't just walk around in schools and sit through teachers classes.

850
01:55:43,568 --> 01:55:43,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

851
01:55:45,585 --> 01:55:46,265
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve?

852
01:55:46,406 --> 01:55:48,006
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for approval by Member Graham.

853
01:55:48,447 --> 01:55:49,587
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Member Hayes.

854
01:55:49,707 --> 01:55:50,548
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

855
01:55:51,148 --> 01:55:51,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

856
01:55:51,709 --> 01:55:52,529
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

857
01:55:53,330 --> 01:55:54,090
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

858
01:55:56,652 --> 01:55:59,113
[SPEAKER_11]: We have another reports requested.

859
01:56:01,634 --> 01:56:04,476
[SPEAKER_11]: Suspension and discipline report requested by Member McLaughlin.

860
01:56:05,076 --> 01:56:08,158
[SPEAKER_11]: One or more questions the report is attempting to answer.

861
01:56:08,278 --> 01:56:10,500
[SPEAKER_11]: How many suspensions are there at each grade level?

862
01:56:11,140 --> 01:56:14,462
[SPEAKER_11]: Does the DESE profile student discipline data indicate improvement?

863
01:56:15,032 --> 01:56:19,916
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there any disproportionality in suspension and discipline for our more vulnerable subgroups?

864
01:56:20,656 --> 01:56:25,140
[SPEAKER_11]: Has staff been trained on OSEP federal 2022 disciplinary guidance?

865
01:56:25,880 --> 01:56:29,923
[SPEAKER_11]: How are incident reports collected and how are families notified of disciplinary actions?

866
01:56:30,063 --> 01:56:30,864
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin.

867
01:56:31,744 --> 01:56:33,286
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I didn't, background.

868
01:56:33,306 --> 01:56:34,266
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's the same one.

869
01:56:34,787 --> 01:56:36,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Data elements you are expecting.

870
01:56:36,628 --> 01:56:43,033
[SPEAKER_11]: Information from DESI profile data on student discipline, information on training for disproportionality in discipline,

871
01:56:43,553 --> 01:56:55,001
[SPEAKER_11]: information on training with respect to social, emotional, and behavioral needs for students with disabilities, for administrators and principals, information on training for culturally competent responsive programs.

872
01:56:55,321 --> 01:56:57,243
[SPEAKER_11]: What is family engagement on these matters?

873
01:56:57,703 --> 01:56:58,844
[SPEAKER_11]: Member McLaughlin, thank you.

874
01:56:59,124 --> 01:56:59,544
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

875
01:57:00,425 --> 01:57:00,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

876
01:57:00,985 --> 01:57:05,469
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yes, I'm just looking for information on all of these data points.

877
01:57:06,469 --> 01:57:11,653
[SPEAKER_10]: There are some of this on our DESE student profiles, which I'd like to be

878
01:57:12,852 --> 01:57:28,597
[SPEAKER_10]: reviewed when we do go over the report which is indicated here in terms of the data elements and I would encourage colleagues if there's anything else that they wanted to add here to please do so but I think that this is important information that we can all benefit from so hoping that we can get this.

879
01:57:29,477 --> 01:57:29,677
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor?

880
01:57:32,118 --> 01:57:34,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I would like to offer an amendment to add a number six to this.

881
01:57:38,445 --> 01:57:52,229
[SPEAKER_05]: The, we received a discipline report earlier this year, Dr Cushing I believe, and what I'd like is to receive that report again with an explanation as to whether or not that report reflects actuals.

882
01:57:52,850 --> 01:58:03,553
[SPEAKER_05]: What I mean by that is, if 50 kids get a detention and 30 show up is the discipline report showing us the 30 that showed up, or the 50 that should have been there.

883
01:58:06,842 --> 01:58:13,304
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I'm assuming that every kid who gets a detention, for instance, doesn't show, especially on Saturdays.

884
01:58:14,385 --> 01:58:22,068
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I would just like to, you know, the report we received in January was challenging to comprehend.

885
01:58:22,668 --> 01:58:32,932
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a lot of duplicative stuff going on, but I'd like to include that report as number six and an explanation of what it even means, if that's acceptable.

886
01:58:33,052 --> 01:58:36,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure, that would be in comparison to the data that's here as well, because I think

887
01:58:37,193 --> 01:58:51,600
[SPEAKER_10]: The question number five should answer some of that around the incident reports collected and how we're notified in terms of the data for the discipline that you're talking about, but I'd be willing to accept that amendment and make a motion to approve.

888
01:58:55,522 --> 01:59:06,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor, before you do that, I also wanted to offer a friendly amendment to number one, to read how many,

889
01:59:07,247 --> 01:59:15,611
[SPEAKER_09]: in-school suspensions, out-of-school suspensions, detentions, social probations, and other forms of discipline?

890
01:59:16,571 --> 01:59:24,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there at each grade level, and to member Rousseau's point, issued and served?

891
01:59:25,095 --> 01:59:36,420
[SPEAKER_09]: So I was hoping to get a little bit more information about some of these bigger categories of student discipline so that we can understand for ourselves

892
01:59:37,443 --> 01:59:58,436
[SPEAKER_09]: when we are suspending in school versus out of school, when we are putting kids on social probation, when we are issuing detentions, and then, you know, that sort of nuance of are we issuing and they're being served or are we issuing and they're not being served, probably more in the case of like a detention, but wanted to see that same breakout for all of those categories.

893
01:59:59,897 --> 02:00:00,137
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor?

894
02:00:01,224 --> 02:00:01,844
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

895
02:00:02,384 --> 02:00:10,407
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I heard you on the first three but I'm not sure what you mean by other because that can be really vast for the administration to try to address.

896
02:00:10,447 --> 02:00:11,448
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not sure what you mean by that.

897
02:00:11,828 --> 02:00:14,849
[SPEAKER_09]: I I don't know what the other categories are either.

898
02:00:15,029 --> 02:00:19,811
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I think I'm looking for the administration to identify if there's something missing from that list.

899
02:00:19,991 --> 02:00:20,191
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

900
02:00:20,231 --> 02:00:24,012
[SPEAKER_09]: That is commonly executed in our schools and I wanna know about that too.

901
02:00:24,052 --> 02:00:24,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

902
02:00:24,713 --> 02:00:28,394
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I guess I would just clarify that to say and if there are other what

903
02:00:31,487 --> 02:00:34,928
[SPEAKER_10]: So did you, if you got that, yeah.

904
02:00:35,148 --> 02:00:35,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, that was a mouthful.

905
02:00:36,429 --> 02:00:37,129
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a mouthful.

906
02:00:38,149 --> 02:00:41,170
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would accept that and make a motion to approve.

907
02:00:41,991 --> 02:00:42,271
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

908
02:00:42,411 --> 02:00:46,852
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion for approval as amended by member Rousseau and member Graham.

909
02:00:47,973 --> 02:00:49,513
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by member Graham.

910
02:00:49,733 --> 02:00:50,553
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

911
02:00:50,894 --> 02:00:51,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Aye.

912
02:00:51,494 --> 02:00:52,254
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

913
02:00:52,814 --> 02:00:53,574
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

914
02:00:54,595 --> 02:00:55,055
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

915
02:00:56,555 --> 02:00:57,436
[SPEAKER_11]: We have condolences.

916
02:00:57,476 --> 02:01:01,277
[SPEAKER_11]: The Medford School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of William

917
02:01:01,752 --> 02:01:14,919
[SPEAKER_11]: Matarazzo, father of former cosmetology teacher Janice DePace, and the Memphis School Committee expresses its sincere condolences to the family of Albert Panarisi, a former science teacher at the Roberts Junior High School.

918
02:01:15,079 --> 02:01:17,340
[SPEAKER_11]: We all may rise for a moment of silence.

919
02:01:30,387 --> 02:01:30,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

920
02:01:33,115 --> 02:01:39,143
[SPEAKER_11]: Next meeting is Monday, December 5th, regular school committee meeting here in the chambers, as well as on Zoom.

921
02:01:40,104 --> 02:01:43,048
[SPEAKER_11]: Good luck to the Medford Mustangs tomorrow night and happy Thanksgiving.

922
02:01:43,088 --> 02:01:44,009
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to adjourn.

923
02:01:44,550 --> 02:01:47,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham.

924
02:01:47,413 --> 02:01:48,154
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

925
02:01:48,575 --> 02:01:48,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

926
02:01:48,715 --> 02:01:49,456
[SPEAKER_11]: All those opposed?

927
02:01:49,596 --> 02:01:50,177
[SPEAKER_11]: Meeting is adjourned.
