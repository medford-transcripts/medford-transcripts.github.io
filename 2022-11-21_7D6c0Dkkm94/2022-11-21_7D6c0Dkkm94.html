    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2763.765s">Number</a>  five, consent agenda, bills and payrolls, regular school committee meeting minutes from November 7th, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2768.889s">So</a>  motion on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2773.69s">by</a>  Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2777.051s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2778.192s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2778.932s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2780.353s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2781.794s">Make</a>  a motion to take the good of the order off the table.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2783.995s">Motion</a>  to take number three off the table, good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2789.097s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2790.157s">By</a>  Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Graham. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2792.718s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2793.859s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2794.259s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2796.32s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2800.602s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2802.142s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2804.388s">for</a>  the good of the order, which is basically us assessing how we're doing collaboratively as a school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2809.95s">And</a>  we review monthly what we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2812.59s">I</a>  know in the past we talked about and we approved a motion for us to meet to set school committee goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2819.932s">And</a>  I know that we talked about that potentially happening as a committee of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2825.113s">So</a>  I was wondering if we could consider this as a committee of the whole before one of our monthly meetings next month. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2832.313s">and</a>  in which case, if we do, I know that I shared some information earlier about the MASC conference, but there was definitely a session there in particular that the MASC offers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2841.395s">In</a>  fact, it's our rep, Dorothy Presser, that offers it specifically on school committee goals, but also aligning those goals with superintendent goals. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2849.097s">So</a>  I'm sure that could be available to us as a recording. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2852.898s">I</a>  think they recorded several of the sessions and or as a PowerPoint, if we want those ahead of time to prepare for the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2858.519s">So</a>  I guess I'm putting out there for my colleagues <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2862.67s">if</a>  we can consider a meeting, a committee of the whole to address our school committee goals here for next month.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2871.652s">Yep,</a>  we have a meeting on the 5th and the 19th. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2877.433s">So</a>  I'm superintendent, if we could schedule a goals meeting before a regular committee meeting on one of those two days at five o'clock, that'd be great.</p>

    <p>[Sharon Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2888.175s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2889.003s">Member</a>  Hays. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2889.723s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2890.103s">Yeah,</a>  I also had something for the good of the order. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2891.924s">I</a>  wanted to, as we've talked a lot about trying to get more student engagement and student involvement, I wanted to discuss the possibility or at least bring up the possibility of having an agenda item that's actually dedicated to the student representatives, so that if they had something they wanted to talk about, if there was an issue, a question, a concern, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2913.555s">or</a>  if they wanted to highlight the student achievement, anything, just to put it on the agenda so it's not as if they have to approach us to ask if they can talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2922.302s">Just</a>  a thought, just a way to try to give them more space and support their voice in our meetings.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2932.57s">I</a>  think that's a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2933.57s">I</a>  was also wondering, and thank you for bringing that up through the chair, member Hays, because I was wondering if there's an opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2939.842s">for</a>  them to have a microphone as well so that they don't have to come and sit with us sort of to be able to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2945.125s">So</a>  if we can get, even if, I mean, there's so many opportunities for wireless mics, whatever here, we don't have to have them wired in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2951.088s">I'm</a>  sure between our media center and John McLaughlin, we can get something set up so that there's a microphone where they are able to stay in their seat and speak like the rest of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2960.232s">I</a>  think that would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2962.954s">Russo.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2963.594s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2964.255s">That's</a>  an excellent, I really liked that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2966.095s">I</a>  was in communication with the station manager <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2970.496s">It's</a>  today's Tuesday, Monday, this weekend, this weekend. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2974.979s">And</a>  he said that the mayor had approved spending to do some work to redo all of this stuff, the technology part of the chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2988.789s">So</a>  I think that that's an excellent idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2991.471s">And</a>  if that's gonna be happening, then why not just include that spot <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=2998.099s">as</a>  being fully wired in, why not? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3001.021s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3002.342s">Yes,</a>  there is some upgrades. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3004.423s">Big</a>  part of our water sewer infrastructure, as well as IT broadband. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3008.466s">So</a>  we have some capacity there.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3010.107s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3012.409s">Is</a>  there any kind of a timeline on when that might happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3014.611s">I</a>  know sometimes it can take a while for the technology piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3017.232s">So</a>  maybe in the interim, we could start with a wireless option or something.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3021.715s">We</a>  have a wireless mic in the, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3025.995s">TV</a>  room so we can make sure it's placed on the desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3028.456s">I</a>  think that's an easy solution.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3030.057s">Yeah,</a>  for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3030.737s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3030.997s">And</a>  I signed for that IT paper, I believe, last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3034.339s">So</a>  yes, things take some... I like those.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3037.04s">Yes,</a>  there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3037.661s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3038.341s">Thank</a>  you, John. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3039.362s">And</a>  then lastly, is there an opportunity that we can get them just a student rep nameplate? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3046.305s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3048.286s">I</a>  think Clerk Hurtubise orders those. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3050.707s">Do</a>  you order these ones? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3052.148s">The</a>  school side?</p>

    <p>[Sharon Hays]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3056.157s">Probably</a>  the school side.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3062.56s">So</a>  I would just suggest we put student rep, just one that says student rep. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3066.161s">Yeah,</a>  that's a good idea.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3067.302s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3067.922s">Yeah,</a>  thank you.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3799.784s">I</a>  had the opportunity to stop by the Thanksgiving food drive. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3804.628s">And</a>  I want you to know that the partners that were participating in that were our own Medford Family Network, Marie Cassidy was there, and she said, this is Lucky 13. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3817.279s">So</a>

Elementary School, Principal O'Brien for making this Thanksgiving food drive a tremendous success. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3916.882s">And</a>  according to Miss Doherty, she said that was the largest amount of bags that they were <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3923.147s">So</a>  it's continuing to get bigger and bigger in terms of what it is that they're able to do for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3928.912s">So</a>  I just wanted to say a special thank you to them, and happy Thanksgiving to all of the families that will be receiving those special gift bags. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3940.582s">This</a>  past weekend also, some of you I don't remember your soul and maybe many others have you had the opportunity to support our drama club presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3951.055s">They</a>  performed a play by Oscar Wilde, the importance of being honest, our students did a fabulous job. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3959.605s">And</a>  I can say it's wonderful to be in the theater live theater, seeing a performance seeing our students perform. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3967.491s">It</a>  just really does raise everyone's spirits. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3972.375s">And</a>  I want to also say a special thank you to Miss Riley Jones who helped to bring everything alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3980.061s">on</a>  the stage. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3981.142s">And</a>  I was truly impressed that our students were able to maintain British accents. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3987.246s">So</a>  I had the opportunity to say, like, how long did it take you? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3990.548s">And</a>  one of the students said, oh, my dad's from the UK. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3994.391s">You</a>  got to practice at home with dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=3996.372s">But</a>  the other students, you know, they really did a great job staying in character. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4002.797s">And</a>  it was really wonderful to see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4007.647s">I</a>  also want to take a quick moment to thank state rep, Sean Goverly, and our entire delegation for their work on a bill that will allow students with intellectual or intellectual disabilities or autism the opportunity to attend Massachusetts public colleges and universities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4029.806s">The</a>  Commonwealth is the first nation, the first state in the nation to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4036.456s">Per</a>  the signed bill by Governor Baker, an individual shall not be denied an opportunity to participate in higher education solely due to the individual's disability status. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4051.942s">This</a>  is truly wonderful news, and we will hear more about it later today in a resolution on our agenda from Member McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4061.819s">There</a>  are a few upcoming events that I want to say as I bring my announcements to a close. <a

href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4226.481s">Over</a>  the river and through the wood, trot fast by dappled gray, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4233.548s">spring</a>  over the ground like a hunting hound for this is Thanksgiving Day. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4240.614s">Over</a>  the river and through the wood and straight through the barnyard gate, we seem to go extremely slow. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4249.182s">It</a>  is so hard to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4252.84s">I</a>  wish everyone a wonderful Thanksgiving surrounded by your family, friends and neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4256.483s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4257.383s">Thank</a>  you. <a

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4280.03s">Mass</a>  General Law, Chapter 71, Section 37H and 37H and a half, 37H and three fourths, school discipline and student privacy.</p>

    <p>[Marice Edouard-Vincent]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4289.578s">I</a>  would like to invite Attorney Felicia Vasudevan from Murphy, Hess, Truman, and Lohan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4301.428s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Vasudevan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4304.17s">Welcome,</a>  Felicia. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4306.051s">Good</a>  evening, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4306.792s">Thank</a>  you for having me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4309.259s">I'm</a>  going to be sharing my screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4311.16s">And</a>  so I'm here to just give an overview on different discipline laws, as well as local policy, school committee policy on discipline that was adopted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4335.782s">So</a>  first as an overview, local policy, the Medford School Committee adopted a policy requiring before thinking about suspensions that there's a certain degree of restorative practices. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4349.13s">The</a>  policy allows school staff to, school administration to engage in suspensions, but says that restorative practices should be used when possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4361.617s">There's</a>  no sort of outright prohibition on <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4365.499s">suspensions,</a>  but does say that generally suspensions should be for five grounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4373.663s">So</a>  one is possession of a weapon or exhibiting violent behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4378.725s">Ground</a>  two is, you know, language or actions that are based in racism or discrimination. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4384.007s">Ground</a>  three is sort of bullying or retaliation or words or acts that have an intimidating impact on other students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4391.69s">The</a>  fourth category is possession of drugs. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4394.848s">with</a>  the potential to distribute. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4396.609s">And</a>  finally is academic integrity, where there's a repeated propensity to engage in behavior that doesn't show academic integrity. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4408.174s">So</a>  that's the local policy and that's overlaid with state policy about suspensions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4414.772s">And</a>  state policy about suspensions doesn't dictate sort of when an administrator suspend. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4420.595s">It's</a>  more about how administration, if they decide to suspend, what process they have to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4426.958s">So</a>  generally, there are three categories of process offered, depending on the type of offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4433.981s">The</a>  first is 37H, which is weapons, drugs, and assault on staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4439.824s">The</a>  second category is 37H and a half, which is felonies. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4443.458s">And</a>  then there's the 37H and three quarters category that's the everything else category. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4449.1s">And</a>  so that could be vaping, that could be bullying, that could be harassment and discrimination, that could be student on student fights. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4460.163s">All</a>  that fits in the 37H and three quarters category. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4464.504s">So</a>  for the first category, 37H, that allows the principal to expel or suspend a student. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4472.776s">All</a>  that's required is notice of an opportunity for hearing before the principal and a hearing before the principal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4479.923s">If</a>  the student's expelled, there is a right to appeal to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4485.168s">But</a>  if it's just a suspension, there's no right to appeal to the superintendent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4489.632s">And</a>  again, that's only for possession of controlled substance, dangerous weapons, or assault on school staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4498.429s">37H</a>  and a half is felony charges. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4500.39s">And</a>  again, this allows us to suspend a student if they have a felony charge and their continued presence would have a substantial detrimental effect on the general welfare of the school and allows a principal to expel a student who's been convicted of a felony and their continued presence would have a substantial detrimental effect on the general welfare of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4520.264s">And</a>  so, generally what's required is just notice to the student and the parent <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4526.938s">that</a>  there's going to be a suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4529.239s">And</a>  then there is the right to appeal to the superintendent in writing if someone wanted to dispute that suspension or expulsion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4540.862s">And</a>  so then we get into the 37H and three quarters bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4545.643s">In</a>  this bucket, you cannot expel a student. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4548.344s">You</a>  can only suspend a student for at most <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4552.217s">90</a>  school days in a school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4553.898s">And</a>  again, this is the everything else bucket. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4557.8s">And</a>  so generally, except for emergency removals or in-school suspensions that have sort of their own set procedures, the general requirement for a suspension under 37H and three quarters is that families have to get notice of a hearing, they have a hearing, and then they get the notice of outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4576.448s">And</a>  that's the general framework. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4577.748s">The</a>  amount of procedure that's offered sort of depends on the length of the suspension, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4581.597s">with</a>  long-term suspensions requiring more rights and more procedure than a short-term suspension, so a suspension of less than 10 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4590.924s">But</a>  that's the, no matter whether you're talking about a short-term suspension or a long-term suspension, that's the general framework for suspensions under 37H and three quarters, notice, hearing, and then notice of outcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4604.575s">There</a>  is an exception for emergency removals. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4606.677s">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4610.341s">If</a>  the student's continued presence poses a danger to persons or property, or materially and substantially disrupts the order of the school, then a principal or an assistant principal can remove the student without that sort of pattern of notice, hearing, opportunity, and outcome decision, and can remove them prior to the hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4630.932s">But</a>  the suspension hearing has to be held within two days following the emergency removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4635.675s">And</a>  again, to emergency remove a student, it has to meet that standard. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4639.397s">Continued</a>  presence has to pose a danger to persons or property or materially and substantially disrupt the order of the school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4648.022s">And</a>  whenever a school district engages in discipline, that's confidential student record information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4653.645s">No</a>  third party, so members of the community, even teachers who don't need to know that for their job, other school staff that don't need to know it for their job, don't have access to that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4669.364s">without</a>  specific informed written consent of the eligible student or the parent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4675.687s">And</a>  so all that information has to be kept confidential under our student records regulations because discipline is sort of one of your quintessential student record information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4688.273s">So</a>  that's it for my presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4689.834s">I</a>  appreciate everyone having me here.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4694.316s">McLaughlin?</a> </p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4705.017s">Thank</a>  you, thank you for the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4706.498s">There's</a>  helpful information here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4709.379s">And</a>  I wanted to ask if the, to clarify if the 37H and a half and 37H and three quarter are specific to students with disability, or are there other items on here that are specific to students with disability?</p>

    <p>[Vasudevan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4723.578s">There's</a>  nothing here that's specific to students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4727.079s">These</a>  procedures sort of don't change in terms of how we go about deciding whether to suspend a student if a student's with disability. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4734.661s">The</a>  difference for students with disability is in sort of the procedure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4740.903s">There's</a>  an additional layer of procedure for students with disabilities that if we're talking about an exclusion of a student for over 10 school days, then we have to start having manifestation determinations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4750.715s">which</a>  means that there's a meeting where people discuss whether the behavior is a manifestation of the disability. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4755.997s">And</a>  if it is, then you can't suspend the students.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4761.78s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4762.14s">So</a>  that manifestation hearing happens if there's a 10 day suspension, is that right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4766.302s">It's</a>  if you get more than 10 days cumulatively. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4770.144s">Cumulatively</a>  over the year, it doesn't have to be consecutively.</p>

    <p>[Vasudevan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4772.505s">Correct,</a>  yes.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4774.185s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4774.506s">And</a>  then the manifestation hearing is a manifestation of whether their disability influenced the discipline.</p>

    <p>[Vasudevan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4780.944s">Yeah,</a>  the question is, was their conduct substantially related to their disability or was it due to our failure to implement either the IEP or the 504 plan? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4789.889s">If</a>  the answer is yes to either question, then the student has a right to return and we consider doing a functional behavior assessment or updating the behavior intervention plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4800.676s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4801.016s">That's</a>  super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4801.637s">I</a>  just want people to understand the nuances of the law, which obviously all law has nuance, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4807.951s">I</a>  really appreciate you mentioning that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4809.292s">Thanks</a>  so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4810.133s">Yeah,</a>  of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4810.653s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4814.055s">Felicia</a>  if I may from the chair, with regards to the amount of days for suspensions is their standards out there I don't know if they're written in the law or is that fully the discretion of the principal and then appeal rights to the superintendent.</p>

    <p>[Vasudevan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4832.879s">There's</a>  nothing in the law about how many days an administrator can spend. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4836.22s">That's</a>  within the discretion of the administrator. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4838.321s">And</a>  the right to appeal to the superintendent is for any long-term suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4845.264s">So</a>  any suspension over 10 days cumulatively or consecutively, there is a right to appeal to the superintendent for a short-term suspension. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4853.207s">There's</a>  no right to appeal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4854.447s">Got</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4857.569s">OK,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4859.009s">Thank</a>  you for being here.</p>

    <p>[Vasudevan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4860.27s">Yeah,</a>  thank you for having me.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4865.143s">We</a>  have a report on 2023 Special Education Determination under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education, IDEA, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4875.647s">Joan</a>  Bowen, Director of Student Services.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4882.25s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4883.35s">Tonight</a>  I will be reporting on the 2022-2023 determinations of need for special education technical assistance <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4891.577s">or</a>  intervention from Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4894.579s">Just</a>  to give you a little background is under the Federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education must make annual determinations regarding local education agencies specific needs for technical assistance or intervention in special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4915.296s">And</a>  Massachusetts does so based on four categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4919.88s">Next</a>  slide. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4921.688s">It's</a>  meet the four categories would be meets requirements needs assistance needs intervention or need substantial intervention. <a

Public Schools performance and compliance data, including data from the general accountability and assistance system, tiered focus monitoring process, state complaints, and state performance plan and our annual performance reports. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4956.895s">The</a>  rubric specifically considers the following, five-year cohort graduation rates for students with disabilities, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4964.243s">an</a>  annual dropout rate for students with disabilities, our public school monitoring special education compliance data, problem resolution system special education complaint data, performance on our special education state performance plan and our annual performance report based on indicators that we are identified in a cohort and we need to report on on a yearly basis, as well as data and findings of significant disproportionality. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4993.943s">Next</a>  slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=4995.784s">So</a>  each agency is evaluated using the rubric and based on the overall score placed into one of the LEA determination categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5004.59s">As</a>  described in the determination rubric, final LEA determinations reflect both performance and compliance in special education. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5013.877s">This</a>  year, the five-year cohort graduation rate and least restrictive environments, which are indicators five and six, and I'll explain a little bit more at the end, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5022.172s">when</a>  I show you the graph of Medford specific results this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5027.456s">So</a>  they continue to be prioritized by the department and are weighted times 1.5 and times 2.0 respectively. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5036.304s">Additionally,</a>  points for problem resolution system complaints are calculated per a thousand students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5044.551s">Next</a>  slide, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5046.072s">So</a>  Medford results. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5047.253s">So</a>  as a result of the 2022-2023 school year, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5051.383s">Medford</a>  Public Schools earned 23.5 out of 30 possible points on the rubric or 78.3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5059.569s">Last</a>  year, Medford Public School District earned 29 out of 36 possible points on the rubric or 80.6%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5068.295s">Medford</a>  received an overall rating of meeting requirements, which is consistent to last year's rating. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5074.738s">Therefore,</a>  the department will not be providing targeted technical assistance or intervention in these LEAs based on the LEA determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5083.303s">So</a>  the last slide is the specific <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5087.305s">indicators</a>  or information that the department looked at in regards to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5092.769s">So</a>  the first one is our annual dropout rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5096.071s">And</a>  Medford got a 3.4%, two out of four points. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5100.774s">This</a>  was a little bit different than last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5103.376s">We</a>  received 2% last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5106.438s">But</a>  if you look at when the annual dropout rate was, the information that they took, it was during the 2021 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5113.466s">So</a>  that we had just returned from COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5116.407s">It</a>  was the first school year back in session. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5118.548s">There</a>  were different cohorts coming in a time and it was difficulty getting students engaged in learning and back in school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5124.77s">So</a>  I just want people to take that under consideration when we're looking at the annual dropout rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5131.092s">The</a>  five-year cohort graduation rate is indicator one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5135.754s">And</a>  this score indicates that Medford is at or above the state's rate of 91% <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5142.265s">for</a>  the five-year cohort graduation rate for students with disabilities compared to last year's rate, which was 83.9%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5150.635s">So</a>  this year we're at 87%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5153.058s">So</a>  we have an increase in the students and our five-year cohort graduation rate, which is an improvement from the previous year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5161.992s">The</a>  next is the public school monitoring compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5166.577s">So</a>  this is through the problem resolution system and this is through Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5174.386s">And</a>  what happens is parents, caregivers, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5179.511s">Um,</a>  they can file a complaint with P. R. S. And what P. R. S. Looks at is if the local agency has violated education law regulations or compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5190.774s">They</a>  take a look at the complaint and then they will provide the district with a letter of finding that we need to do an internal investigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5198.897s">We</a>  may need to provide documentation on what we did <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5203.258s">to</a>  prove that we were in compliance, we provide that all to DESE, and then they make a final determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5210.02s">So</a>  last year, Medford Public Schools did have 12 PRS complaints, and it was a wide range. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5215.922s">It</a>  could have been from parents feeling that their students weren't receiving the appropriate level of services, or there was a bullying report, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5225.986s">So</a>  it is a wide range. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5227.866s">So</a>  based on those, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5230.588s">12</a>  PRS complaints, there were two that no formal action was taken to that there was a letter of withdrawal that the teams were able to meet and have a team meeting and resolve the issue before it had to go any further. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5243.937s">There</a>  were five no findings of non compliance so each of those let Medford know that we met the, we were following regulations and compliance and the law in regards to those complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5256.242s">There</a>  was one finding of non compliance, and that resulted in the district doing a corrective action <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5262.865s">And</a>  what happens is you look at what the complaint is, where we were found to not be in compliant and offer some professional development to staff to review that law regulation, and then to do some in-district monitoring to make sure that we don't do that again in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5280.095s">And</a>  they will look for that documentation over the course of the year to make sure that we're following through on what that issue may have been that we were found in non-compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5290.915s">And</a>  two, we are still waiting to hear decisions from PRS. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5297.74s">They</a>  have probably 98 complaints that they're working on, and typically they may have like 68, but every day they're getting more and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5304.725s">So</a>  the process is taking a little longer to get the results of those two. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5309.651s">So</a>  the score of three indicates that there were one to 2.9 letters of finding issued per 1,000 students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5317.613s">This</a>  year's score was a 2.4 compared to last year's score of three. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5323.475s">The</a>  next three indicators are indicators 4B, nine and 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5330.516s">4B</a>  is regarding suspensions and expulsions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5333.737s">And</a>  it's the percentage of Medfords <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5337.726s">if</a>  there's a significant discrepancy by race and ethnicity. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5343.489s">The</a>  next one is indicator nine, which is disproportionate representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5349.051s">So</a>  they look at the percentage of districts with disproportionate representation of racial ethnic groups due to inappropriate identification. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5357.355s">And</a>  then indicator 10 is also a disproportionate representation in specific disability categories. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5365.646s">So</a>  the percentage of districts with disproportionate representation of racial ethnic groups in a specific disability category due to inappropriate identification. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5376.594s">These</a>  three indicators received a score of four, which indicates that there are no compliance findings, which is also consistent with last year's performance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5386.662s">Indicator</a>  five, this is our percentage of students with IEPs, ages five and enrolled in a kindergarten, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5395.943s">ages</a>  six to 21 who are served either inside regular class 80% or more of the day, either inside regular class less than 40% of the day, or see in separate schools, residential facilities or homebound hospital placements. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5411.968s">And</a>  indicator six is the percentage of children with IEPs ages three, four and five who are enrolled in a preschool program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5420.301s">And</a>  this is A, they receive majority of special education and related services in regular early childhood programs, which is similar to our MEET program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5430.425s">B,</a>  they attend separate special education class, separate school or a residential facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5436.587s">And</a>  C, that they receive special education and related services in the home. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5441.709s">The</a>  percentage of students falling in these categories was 68.5% compared to last year when it was 66.2%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5450.345s">indicating</a>  that more students were found eligible in the course of this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5454.907s">And</a>  that information was also taken from the 2021-22 school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5461.289s">And</a>  lastly is the significant disproportionality data. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5467.191s">Both</a>  from the school year, 21-22 and 22-23 indicates that there is no status in either one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5474.654s">So</a>  we are found to be, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5476.663s">four</a>  out of four points or compliant in that matter as in that area as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5481.949s">In</a>  your packets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5482.69s">I've</a>  also included the chart of indicators that the school district may be asked to provide Jesse with information throughout the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5492.44s">And</a>  there's also a frequently asked question as well as the letter that Medford did receive from <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5499.438s">Desi</a>  regarding these findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5501.059s">I</a>  do want to let you know that the graph was cut off, and that's why I put it at the end of the PowerPoint. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5507.502s">You</a>  couldn't see the last column regarding significant disproportionate, sorry, disproportionality data. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5515.846s">So</a>  that's the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5516.706s">I</a>  don't know if anyone has any specific questions in regards to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5520.228s">I</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5521.969s">Member</a>  McLaughlin.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5523.229s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5524.35s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5525.991s">Bowen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5526.271s">I</a>  know this is a lot of work to put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5529.131s">This</a>  is not obviously the coordinated program review this is the annual le a correct so we it's it's Ted focus monitoring now so there's no longer the correct morning yeah yeah it's yeah so we had done that they love to change that they do they just so you see FM and that was last year where we yeah right yeah and that's the every three year one and yes the annual. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5550.39s">to</a>  differentiate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5551.331s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5552.031s">And</a>  then the indicators, those are the SPP APR indicators. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5555.314s">Is</a>  that what you're talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5556.415s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5556.775s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5557.596s">Would</a>  it be possible, and if not, I can go online and get it if you're not, or if your staff's not available, but would it be possible to get a list of the indicators, just indicators one through nine?</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5566.983s">I</a>  did, I included that in the packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5568.664s">Where</a>  is that?</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5569.084s">So</a>  it's a single sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5571.366s">Let</a>  me just get it for you.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5574.188s">Do</a>  you have it?</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5576.79s">So</a>  it looks like this, it says IVC. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5578.932s">Yeah,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5580.836s">So</a>  that's, thank you, that's super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5583.037s">And</a>  so those are all, yeah, looking at, those are all the indicators that the state looks at in terms of the special education.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5594.743s">Correct,</a>  but we're not responsible for all of them every single year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5597.964s">We're</a>  putting a cohort and there are specific indicators <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5601.316s">that</a>  we have to report on at the beginning of the school year and at the end of the school year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5605.138s">So</a>  indicator seven is one of those, indicator 14, but we have to input this information and that's what DESE looks at.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5613.283s">So</a>  do they randomize what indicators that we report on at the beginning and the end?</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5617.025s">Are</a>  they different or are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5618.346s">So</a>  no, it's at the start of the school year, we may look at preschool enrollment and then we look at the end of the school year, how many students were found eligible, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5628.325s">ages</a>  three, four, and five, and we need to make sure that they were found eligible before their third birthday and that they were receiving services. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5634.689s">So</a>  they look at that and then transition, it's post-secondary outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5640.272s">So</a>  we have to follow up for three years with students who are on IEPs as to, you know, when they graduated, what they're doing now, if they're, you know, if they started in college, are they continuing? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5653.361s">And</a>  they look at that data as well.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5654.902s">Okay,</a>  so if I understand you correctly, you're saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5657.84s">It's</a>  a randomized indicator list that you get at the beginning of the year that tell you what indicators your cohorts going to be responsible for reporting on correct have the 17 indicators that there are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5668.404s">And</a>  so you get to annually that you report no currently we have.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5674.064s">three</a>  this year, but it varies every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5677.606s">So</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5678.967s">So</a>  that would be great if maybe at the beginning of the year, if we could know what the three are, if you wouldn't mind letting us know in the beginning of the year what the three are that are being reported on so we can kind of keep an eye on those. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5691.294s">I</a>  can actually show you the schedule of what it looks like and what the activities are that we're responsible throughout the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5697.157s">Sure,</a>  that would be awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5697.958s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5698.338s">And</a>  then what was the other thing I was going to ask you? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5702.135s">Oh,</a>  and thank you for the breakdown on the public school monitoring compliance in terms of the PRS complaints, that's super helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5710.137s">We've</a>  asked PRS for that data in the past, and it's been a little bit trickier to get, so it's nice to hear it from you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5715.598s">Much</a>  appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5717.218s">And</a>  then regarding 504 and OCR, were there any, so Office of Civil Rights complaint or the procedural safeguards for 504, but also students with IEPs. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5727.56s">So</a>  I know there was the public school monitoring, was there any OCR complaints? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5730.681s">No,</a>  there were not. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5731.361s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5732.1s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5733.001s">And</a>  then a 78.3%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5736.245s">And</a>  certainly while there's, you know, there's been lots of great things that have been happening, I don't know what the great equivalent is just not being a teacher and having had a report card myself a little while. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5745.916s">What</a>  would a 78.3% be a great equivalent, I would say, maybe.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5751.436s">I'm</a>  gonna go with a B minus or a C plus. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5755.017s">There</a>  is room for improvement and I would like to see that number higher, but they did change some of the criteria and how they, like the times 2.0, that was different this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5765.52s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5766.46s">So</a>  if you could generalize with a B minus or a C plus, if you were talking to your student or somebody, you know, your child and you were saying, okay, what, you know, you did okay, but let's think about what the room for improvement is and what can we work on? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5778.144s">What</a>  would you say those things?</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5780.191s">I</a>  would want to know why, you know, high school dropout rates have increased a little bit like what is the root cause of that and then what sort of strategy, what can we implement, you know, we have engagement specialists, how do we, you know, use them more to is it is it school for like what's the root cause of why students aren't finishing school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5800.82s">attendance?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5801.541s">Is</a>  it social emotional needs? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5803.342s">I</a>  mean, I think there's a bigger picture that we need to look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5807.005s">But</a>  that based on this information that I got last week, I'd like to do a deeper dive into that we can drill down into.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5813.45s">And</a>  then thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5814.27s">And</a>  then just one last thing there was what was the other one that was the 68.5% to six out of eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5821.856s">So</a>  one was the two out of four, which is the annual dropout rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5824.558s">The</a>  other one was the six out of eight, which was the indicators five and six, which is my indicator cheat sheet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5830.58s">Five</a>  and six are educational environments and preschool environment, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5833.561s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5834.381s">So</a>  educational environment or percentage of children with IEPs, five and six served inside regular class, 80% or more inside regular class, less than 40%. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5844.786s">So</a>  it's the inclusion rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5846.646s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5847.107s">In</a>  general. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5848.147s">But</a>  it's also looking at students who are also in out of district programming. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5852.108s">So</a>  there's three different.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5853.349s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, I see the criteria. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5854.95s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5855.81s">So</a>  is that saying that there's room for improvement <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5858.83s">on</a>  our inclusion data? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5860.071s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5861.052s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5862.013s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5862.713s">Super</a>  helpful.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5863.694s">Member</a>  Ruseau? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5864.735s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5866.597s">This</a>  is a lot to digest. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5868.418s">And</a>  so my first question is, well, we just heard that the things that are being measured change every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5880.649s">So</a>  my question around is this data available online? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5885.092s">It</a>  is, it is.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5886.173s">I</a>  can actually send you the link if you'd like to, and you can see the reports from previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5891.357s">And</a>  if you can't, I have them, I get them in a letter and I would be willing to share those with you so you can take a look at it.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5897.323s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5897.923s">Because</a>  I mean, some of these things, two out of four sounds like a 50%, but if the average for the state is one out of four, then two out of four looks good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5910.494s">If</a>  the average for the state is three out of four,</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5913.731s">Yeah,</a>  so this is all on Desi's website. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5916.833s">They</a>  sent us the link. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5918.434s">It</a>  might be in the letter there, but I can get that for you for sure.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5921.756s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5924.157s">The</a>  post-graduation outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5928.3s">We</a>  had talked about that, I don't know, a few years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5931.322s">Everything's</a>  before the pandemic, it seems. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5933.003s">But</a>  about how hard it was, it was in response to a series, I don't know if it was, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5943.064s">some</a>  podcast series around how first-generation kids, especially kids of color, okay, Siri thinks I wanna talk to Siri, who would go to college and then the dropout rate was through the roof as a freshman in college because they were not prepared, they had no understanding of what college was like. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5967.664s">And</a>  when we talked about that here about, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5972.387s">you</a>  know, how do we figure out what are we doing, what we need to do to make sure that when they leave and go to college, because we have a big sort of like almost a celebration every year about who's going where, but, you know, celebrating a kid going off to Bentley and then, you know, three months in they quit, even though they were a straight A student at Medford High, you know, there's a story there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=5997.522s">And,</a>  you know, how do we make sure we're preparing them? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6000.263s">And</a>  I realized like, we can't be responsible for the kids for the rest of their lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6004.725s">So</a>  there's limits, but the ability to understand what happens to kids once they've left was something that was sort of like, not possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6017.269s">What</a>  I'm seeing in this measurement is that you have to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6021.81s">For</a>  students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6023.291s">So</a>  that's right.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6024.051s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6024.531s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6026.012s">How</a>  do you</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6028.31s">Like,</a>  are you like literally like harassing them with phone calls and letters phone calls emails letters yes so we try to get three different types of communication from them and then we check that when we call them every year to make sure it's still accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6042.873s">Sometimes</a>  they still have connections to the guidance Councilors or someone at school so we try to update it and then we do send letters home as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6049.675s">We've</a>  had a pretty good response. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6055.445s">We</a>  try to put things specifically in place all year long up to there right before they graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6060.786s">So</a>  we have this form for every student that's ready to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6065.027s">And</a>  then we follow up with it the following year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6067.867s">Numbers</a>  change, things like that, but we haven't had a lot of mail return to us and the students will reply. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6074.128s">And</a>  there's like a survey that they can fill out if they don't, sometimes they see Medford Public Schools and they won't answer their cell phone, but they will respond to a letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6081.97s">So</a>  yeah, we try different means <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6084.909s">to</a>  make sure that we get that information.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6087.61s">And</a>  how heavy of a lift is that for your staff?</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6093.472s">So</a>  I'm gonna say we have three ETLs. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6096.293s">We're</a>  lucky we have three evaluation team leaders at the high school level and they work closely with the families and that's part of their job.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6102.875s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6103.475s">So</a>  they know it's a requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6104.996s">They</a>  work when they're at the high school level, that this is an activity that we need to do on a yearly basis.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6109.758s">So</a>  that's sort of where I see is the gap is that there are staff <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6114.569s">They're</a>  not teachers are not guidance Councilors like this is their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6117.87s">So</a>  this is part of their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6120.511s">And,</a>  you know, for instance, to find a way to have all the kids be getting these calls and letters, even if it was every year every five years so we could get some sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6131.174s">There's</a>  no staff to do it because there's nobody whose job it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6133.776s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6134.197s">Yeah,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6135.057s">I</a>  just was trying to figure out how do we make it work there but we couldn't figure it out and the rest of the school and I mean Jesse also provided us with a lot of guidance on how to do it forms the standard forms things like that.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6146.887s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6147.688s">And</a>  my last question is, you know, when I first came on the school committee in 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6155.895s">DESE</a>  had just done this whole thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6157.476s">Maybe</a>  it was the federal government, I forget who, around dropout rates was the biggest thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6162.659s">It</a>  was DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6164.52s">And</a>  so then suddenly dropout rates was everything in our report card. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6168.683s">And</a>  just like that, voila, dropout rates dropped to the floor across the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6174.106s">And</a>  of course, it's questionable whether that was accurate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6181.785s">Whenever</a>  I see dropouts, I have to ask the question, are there, for this one, not necessarily for the rest of the student population, are there very strict protocols for determining whether a student is considered dropped out? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6194.331s">And</a>  I ask that because, look, students' families move and they don't feel inspired to respond to MPS, because now they live in Colorado, or they go back to another country or move to a country. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6205.717s">There's</a>  just all these ways in which a student drops off our radar. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6212.523s">many</a>  times they're not dropping out, but we don't know which way it is for a lot of students. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6218.445s">And</a>  I'm just wondering for this particular measurement, are there very strict things where we don't get to make a judgment call or do we get to make a judgment call? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6227.268s">Like,</a>  oh, I knew that kid, John, and I know that his family left and they didn't fill any forms out, but I know they moved to New Hampshire.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6233.51s">So</a>  we have a more formalized process with students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6237.011s">So</a>  there is a process to send out after 10 days of absence, there's a letter that goes out to the families. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6242.046s">But</a>  we also say that we want to have a team meeting at that time to discuss. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6245.268s">So</a>  we bring the family in sometimes with the student to talk about what's going on, why are they not coming to school, and what are options for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6254.512s">And</a>  then we officially unenroll them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6257.274s">So</a>  there is a process, but there are students that do fall through the cracks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6261.656s">But</a>  we do try to get in touch with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6263.877s">We</a>  reach out to the families. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6265.499s">But</a>  sometimes we don't always hear back from the families. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6267.901s">So</a>  we don't know if they've moved to a different state, that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6270.742s">But</a>  we do do the meetings to talk about what are different options. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6274.405s">And</a>  there are some students that just are 18 and they would like to do the high set or something like that, which is the new GED. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6283.33s">So</a>  it's a conversation that takes place during that time.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6286.332s">So,</a>  but I mean, I'm assuming somewhere in school brain, somebody has to code a student as being dropped out.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6292.993s">We</a>  do on our state reporting for students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6296.814s">We</a>  have to indicate that on our EZIEP and we have to put down that they had dropped out and the reasons why.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6304.495s">Okay,</a>  but if you don't have any reasons, John disappeared. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6309.836s">I</a>  mean, you may, if John literally disappears, you may call DCF or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6313.197s">Right,</a>  there's a different process. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6316.445s">you</a>  know, students talking to their teachers, oh, we're moving to Colorado. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6320.807s">And</a>  then they moved to Colorado.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6324.509s">But</a>  then the school district has to reach out to us for their records.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6327.891s">So</a>  that's how we can... When they land somewhere else, they reach out to us.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6331.473s">Yeah,</a>  they do reach out, especially if it's a student with disability or on a 504, they wanna know, they wanna have, you know, their previous evaluations, their IEP, that sort of thing.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6340.127s">Okay,</a>  so do you feel pretty confident that our determination of a student dropping out is pretty robust?</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6345.75s">Yes,</a>  I do.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6346.53s">I'm</a>  not allowed to use that word as a politician, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6349.011s">Okay,</a>  good, that's good to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6351.133s">I</a>  just worry that once we start measuring something, suddenly everybody, the measurement changes once you start looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6359.457s">I</a>  forget that physics law, but all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6363.299s">Thank</a>  you, this is really great information and I look forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6366.3s">I</a>  can't wait to look online. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6367.881s">Yeah,</a>  I'll send you the link tomorrow.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6370.703s">Member</a>  McLaughlin, I just have one more question. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6372.645s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6373.966s">I</a>  just wanted to know about guidance when we get guidance from OSAP or from DESE. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6378.33s">You</a>  know, I know that there was the disability guidance, I mean, the discipline guidance that we had over the summer from OSAP. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6384.995s">There's</a>  just different letters that come out from the Office of Special Education Planning and Policy and from DESE as a whole in terms of disability related issues across the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6396.128s">but</a>  that are specific to our state as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6398.069s">How</a>  does that information get distributed from your office?</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6401.109s">So</a>  there's a monthly special ed directors meetings that I attend through DESE, so we get a lot of the updates then. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6407.611s">And</a>  then I meet with my coordinators on a weekly basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6410.952s">I</a>  call it my slate meeting, and that's when I update them on any new guidance that comes down and how it's going to impact the special education students in our district.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6421.995s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6423.54s">Does</a>  the general education population teachers get any of that guidance information or does that come strictly to the tails and disseminate from them.</p>

    <p>[Joan Bowen]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6432.563s">So</a>  it would, it would depend on what the new guidance is and and who are the people that really need to be informed so if it's new discipline we would want principals assistant principal assistant principals curriculum, you know, as many people involved in that and and that's what we did do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6448.407s">So</a>  I think it just depends on what the guidance is and who really is going to be impacted by the changes.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6677.278s">Member</a>  McLaughlin. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6679.739s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6680.619s">No,</a>  this wasn't offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6682.04s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6682.4s">That</a>  was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6682.88s">Yeah,</a>  there's a typo. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6684.841s">I</a>  just wanted to make note of it is college life. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6686.722s">I</a>  see that you recognize that, so thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6688.623s">That</a>  could be reflected and fixed in the minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6692.124s">That</a>  would be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6693.824s">And</a>  as the superintendent was saying earlier, this is a landmark. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6698.271s">Legislation</a>  that representative Garber Lee was a key. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6703.535s">driver</a>  in the macy legislation so macy is mass inclusive concurrent enrollment program and. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6713.542s">Sean</a>  has just really represented Garber Lee has just really been pushing this uphill for several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6718.233s">And</a>  as stated for our students that don't achieve MCAS passing on the 10th grade MCAS, which is a requirement for a high school diploma, this allows them to go to post-secondary education and for their, not to be impeded by their disability to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6735.465s">So</a>  these students can attend college life and be part of a college campus and all those things that are afforded to students without disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6743.71s">It's</a>  a big, big deal for, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6747.827s">families</a>  and students with disabilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6749.829s">And</a>  I just want to publicly recognize Representative Garber for the work through a formal letter that can come from the superintendent's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6756.314s">I'm</a>  happy to help you compose the letter if you feel that there's a need for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6760.637s">But</a>  something that's just formally recognizing is really important. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6763.359s">And</a>  then also the resolution that the Macy initiative is recognized in our public school district as part of our high school transition program, which I know that that's been the case. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6773.777s">As</a>  it was being formed and before it was actually law when it was just the inclusive concurrent enrollment program it was called ice at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6783.119s">But</a>  I know that it's state law i'm sure that it will be part of the transition program I just want to make sure that it's recognized it such by this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6791.921s">So</a>  if I could have a motion to approve, I would appreciate it motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6868.348s">Thank</a>  you, Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6869.409s">I</a>  think the report request is self explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6874.292s">This</a>  is in response to multiple podcasts through from American public media that has really gone deep into <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6885.36s">the</a>  state of reading in American public schools and the lack of science that drives the majority of the reading curricula that is used in virtually all schools, even though the <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6901.518s">I</a>  think it's MRIs that were able to show back in the early late 60s that in fact students do not learn to read the way that they're being taught and that the way they're being taught to read is in fact detrimental and harmful to <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6917.627s">the</a>  average and the weaker of the readers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6921.15s">So</a>  I just want to get an understanding and lay of the land and what is going on in Medford in these specific areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6928.796s">And</a>  then obviously based on the results, we would probably have to have more conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6936.522s">But</a>  I felt like this is a good starting point since I can't just walk around in schools and sit through teachers classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=6943.568s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7019.124s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7020.425s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7020.985s">So,</a>  yes, I'm just looking for information on all of these data points. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7026.469s">There</a>  are some of this on our DESE student profiles, which I'd like to be <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7032.852s">reviewed</a>  when we do go over the report which is indicated here in terms of the data elements and I would encourage colleagues if there's anything else that they wanted to add here to please do so but I think that this is important information that we can all benefit from so hoping that we can get this.</p>

    <p>[Paul Ruseau]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7049.477s">Mayor?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7052.118s">I</a>  would like to offer an amendment to add a number six to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7058.445s">The,</a>  we received a discipline report earlier this year, Dr Cushing I believe, and what I'd like is to receive that report again with an explanation as to whether or not that report reflects actuals. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7072.85s">What</a>  I mean by that is, if 50 kids get a detention and 30 show up is the discipline report showing us the 30 that showed up, or the 50 that should have been there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7086.842s">You</a>  know, I'm assuming that every kid who gets a detention, for instance, doesn't show, especially on Saturdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7094.385s">And</a>  so I would just like to, you know, the report we received in January was challenging to comprehend. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7102.668s">There</a>  was a lot of duplicative stuff going on, but I'd like to include that report as number six and an explanation of what it even means, if that's acceptable.</p>

    <p>[Melanie McLaughlin]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7113.052s">Sure,</a>  that would be in comparison to the data that's here as well, because I think <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7117.193s">The</a>  question number five should answer some of that around the incident reports collected and how we're notified in terms of the data for the discipline that you're talking about, but I'd be willing to accept that amendment and make a motion to approve.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7135.522s">Mayor,</a>  before you do that, I also wanted to offer a friendly amendment to number one, to read how many, <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7147.247s">in-school</a>  suspensions, out-of-school suspensions, detentions, social probations, and other forms of discipline? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7156.571s">Are</a>  there at each grade level, and to member Rousseau's point, issued and served? <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7165.095s">So</a>  I was hoping to get a little bit more information about some of these bigger categories of student discipline so that we can understand for ourselves <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7177.443s">when</a>  we are suspending in school versus out of school, when we are putting kids on social probation, when we are issuing detentions, and then, you know, that sort of nuance of are we issuing and they're being served or are we issuing and they're not being served, probably more in the case of like a detention, but wanted to see that same breakout for all of those categories.</p>

    <p>[Jenny Graham]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7210.447s">I'm</a>  not sure what you mean by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7211.828s">I</a>  I don't know what the other categories are either. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7215.029s">So,</a>  I think I'm looking for the administration to identify if there's something missing from that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7219.991s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7D6c0Dkkm94&t=7220.231s">That</a>  is commonly executed in our schools and I wanna know about that too.</p>
