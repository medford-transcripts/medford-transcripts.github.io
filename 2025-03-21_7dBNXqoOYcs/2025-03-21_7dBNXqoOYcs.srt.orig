1
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:20,325
[SPEAKER_04]: We have with us this afternoon State Senator Patricia Jalen, Sheriff Peter Katushin.

2
00:00:20,845 --> 00:00:21,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Please be seated.

3
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:28,430
[SPEAKER_04]: State Representatives Paul Donato, Sean Garbani, and Christine Barber.

4
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,356
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Pat Jalen's been announced.

5
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:38,237
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, come on in.

6
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:51,352
[SPEAKER_04]: We also have with us this afternoon, Mayor-elect Stephanie Muccini-Burke.

7
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:15,926
[SPEAKER_04]: and Memphis City Councilors, Adam Knight, Richard Cargill.

8
00:01:44,037 --> 00:02:09,843
[SPEAKER_04]: and members of the Midship School Committee, John Falco, David George Stout, Marlene Sterling, Erin DiBenedetto, and my wife, Ann Marie.

9
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:10,623
Ann Marie couldn't go.

10
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:11,363
I didn't mean to forget you.

11
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:30,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, before I introduce the mayor and the others, the reason that this looked a little disjointed is because I was going to shake things up.

12
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:33,151
[SPEAKER_04]: But it didn't work out that way.

13
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:34,392
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll have to forgive me.

14
00:02:34,412 --> 00:02:35,632
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm going to do it now.

15
00:02:36,653 --> 00:02:45,435
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I thought that in almost every event of this kind, what we've heard in the past is the elected officials invited name first, and then

16
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,841
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the end of it.

17
00:02:49,181 --> 00:03:01,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm going to change tradition a little bit because a good friend of mine whom I miss so much said just once in his life, he would like to have heard others named at events like this.

18
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Today's the day.

19
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:10,775
[SPEAKER_04]: The first group, and I'm not going to name the names, I'm just going to talk about the group.

20
00:03:11,956 --> 00:03:16,299
[SPEAKER_04]: The first group is the foundation or cornerstone of government.

21
00:03:17,289 --> 00:03:19,850
[SPEAKER_04]: They work where the rubber meets the road.

22
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:30,936
[SPEAKER_04]: They're often the first faces that people will see when they come into City Hall, the school department, the library, the council on aging, or the public safety departments.

23
00:03:31,756 --> 00:03:36,238
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're usually the first voices you'll hear on the telephone when you call these places.

24
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,481
[SPEAKER_04]: They serve the people of Medford with humility and dignity,

25
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:48,823
[SPEAKER_04]: My friends, I'm referring to the members of our clerical staff, the secretaries, and administrative assistants.

26
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:32,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Next, I'd like to acknowledge those people who shape our young people.

27
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:41,834
[SPEAKER_04]: They encourage them to dream and to achieve, and I'm talking about our teachers, our teachers' age, coaches, and instructors in the Medford Public Schools.

28
00:04:58,785 --> 00:05:00,726
[SPEAKER_04]: protect us day in and day out.

29
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:04,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Their hours of service are the same as the number of hours in the day.

30
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this isn't the only guy that I'm talking about.

31
00:05:07,211 --> 00:05:08,252
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll come up in a second.

32
00:05:08,793 --> 00:05:11,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm talking about the members of our police and fire departments

33
00:05:32,162 --> 00:05:40,445
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't be complete without pointing to those who keep our municipal services running and they do so many things that they can't easily be listed.

34
00:05:40,845 --> 00:05:44,867
[SPEAKER_04]: They do it in the heat of July and the freezing temperatures of the winter.

35
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:47,208
[SPEAKER_04]: The members of our Department of Public Works.

36
00:06:00,948 --> 00:06:10,139
[SPEAKER_04]: We also need to acknowledge and we can't forget those residents who take the time out of their lives to serve the city by accepting appointments to our various boards and commissions.

37
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,165
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying yes to service is vital to the proper workings of government.

38
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:19,390
[SPEAKER_04]: I ask that you acknowledge the members of our many boards and commissions.

39
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:46,608
[SPEAKER_04]: The next group I ask you, and we're getting towards the end, the next group that I ask you to acknowledge, the public doesn't always understand fully the demands that are placed on this group, but I have observed this group for over 30 years, and I can best describe them as creative leaders.

40
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:54,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Their work is characterized by honesty, strength, and professionalism.

41
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,681
[SPEAKER_04]: I am honored to work in collaboration with them every single day, and I am blessed to call each of them my friend.

42
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:06,602
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm talking, of course, about my colleagues, the department heads at City Hall.

43
00:07:18,364 --> 00:07:19,425
[SPEAKER_04]: One more program.

44
00:07:20,145 --> 00:07:21,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I added this this morning.

45
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:51,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I ask Mayor McGlynn and the others to come in, I want to respectfully acknowledge all those people who ran for public office, especially this year, the ones that had the courage to put their hat in the ring, whether they won or they didn't win, because their participation keeps the democratic process vibrant and alive for all those who chose to run for public office.

46
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I've kept the mayor waiting long enough.

47
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:25,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I would ask you all, as you have, to please rise and welcome Mayor Michael J. McGlynn, Mrs. Sheila McGlynn, escorted by Romeo Roberts, Sean Freeman, Geshe Tenley, Roy Nelson,

48
00:09:16,623 --> 00:09:17,348
Thank you.

49
00:09:47,496 --> 00:09:50,057
At this time, I'd like to call forth

50
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Romeo Robbins, a fifth grader at the Andrews Middle School.

51
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:51,364
[SPEAKER_04]: and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

52
00:10:57,107 --> 00:10:59,408
[SPEAKER_04]: Romeo is a dear friend of Mayor McGlynn.

53
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:05,711
[SPEAKER_04]: He's from Antigua, and he keeps the mayor posted about the condition of the beaches in the Caribbean.

54
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:29,313
[SPEAKER_04]: I would now like to welcome Renise King, the 2011 Boston Music Award winner for Gospel Inspirational Artist of the Year, and a featured performer for the Boston Parks.

55
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:36,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Renise also serves as musical director at the Waymark Seventh Day Adventist Church in Dorchester,

56
00:11:37,737 --> 00:11:45,630
[SPEAKER_04]: And she is the director of the Honor Union Choir and associate director of music at the United Methodist Church in Boston.

57
00:12:07,137 --> 00:12:12,181
[SPEAKER_06]: And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

58
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:19,331
[SPEAKER_06]: As we gather ourselves in silence,

59
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:50,679
[SPEAKER_04]: And I ask Reverend Noah Evans, the pastor of the Grace Episcopal Church, to deliver the invocation.

60
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:10,025
[SPEAKER_00]: Loving God, in the scriptures you say, seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you, and pray to the Lord on his behalf.

61
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:13,988
[SPEAKER_00]: for in its welfare you find your welfare.

62
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:21,092
[SPEAKER_00]: Behold and visit, we pray, the cities of the earth, especially Medford, this our home.

63
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:26,955
[SPEAKER_00]: Renew the ties of mutual regard which form our civic life.

64
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:29,997
[SPEAKER_00]: Send us honest and able leaders.

65
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:39,563
[SPEAKER_00]: Enable us to eliminate poverty, prejudice, and oppression, that peace may prevail with righteousness and justice of order.

66
00:14:40,837 --> 00:14:49,118
[SPEAKER_00]: and that men and women from different cultures and with differing talents may find with one another the fulfillment of their humanity.

67
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,499
[SPEAKER_00]: And today, especially, bless our mayor, Michael.

68
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Bless him for his many years of commitment and service to our city and community.

69
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:07,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Help him to know your gratitude and our gratitude for all he has done and accomplished.

70
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:09,402
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask this

71
00:15:10,325 --> 00:15:12,365
[SPEAKER_00]: through our one holy and living God.

72
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:13,386
[SPEAKER_00]: Amen.

73
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:20,067
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting my direction from the mayor right behind me.

74
00:15:20,187 --> 00:15:22,607
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not the first time, I'm sure.

75
00:15:22,727 --> 00:15:34,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, I've known Michael McGlynn for many years, long before he was elected mayor of our city, going all the way back to high school days.

76
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's much that I can say about him, but as is always the case,

77
00:15:40,777 --> 00:15:42,718
[SPEAKER_04]: It is his family that knows him best.

78
00:15:43,458 --> 00:16:03,024
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they were behind this microphone, they would say that he is a good son, a caring brother, a loving husband and father, and an extremely proud grandfather.

79
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:10,407
[SPEAKER_04]: When his grandchildren are with him in City Hall, it's almost, he beams with joy.

80
00:16:10,997 --> 00:16:15,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Light emanates from every part of his body when he's with his grandchildren.

81
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:21,480
[SPEAKER_04]: At his core, that is genuinely who Michael McGlynn is.

82
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:32,984
[SPEAKER_04]: And for 28 years now, by their votes, the people of Medford have said another thing about him, and that is, he's a good man.

83
00:16:35,486 --> 00:16:40,309
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have been privileged to be part of his administration for each of those 28 years.

84
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of that, I have some insight on why he has been such a good mayor.

85
00:16:46,814 --> 00:16:49,075
[SPEAKER_04]: And the insight that I share with you is this.

86
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:59,322
[SPEAKER_04]: That for every single day that Michael McGlynn has served the people of Medford as mayor, he has had only one goal.

87
00:17:00,383 --> 00:17:04,126
[SPEAKER_04]: And he has worked towards that goal with kindness,

88
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,865
[SPEAKER_04]: honesty, and vigor.

89
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:25,974
[SPEAKER_04]: In every meeting that he has had with citizens, in every proposal that he has put forth, and in every project that he has initiated, his goal has been to build a better life for each and every resident of the city of Bedford.

90
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:34,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, it is my sincere honor to welcome for his final State of the City Address,

91
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:36,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor Michael Chamberlain.

92
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to tell you, I won't miss this.

93
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:30,103
[SPEAKER_05]: The music, the flag, and good friends.

94
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:32,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't get much better than that.

95
00:18:33,285 --> 00:18:34,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Good afternoon.

96
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:44,212
[SPEAKER_05]: I love hearing the stories from parents whose children have told them, when passing City Hall, that's where Mayim McGlynn lives.

97
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:48,114
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you ask Sheila, she will probably tell you that that is true.

98
00:18:48,134 --> 00:18:49,055
[SPEAKER_05]: But on January 9th, 1961,

99
00:18:56,251 --> 00:18:58,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I met President John F. Kennedy with my father.

100
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:03,493
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a day filled with excitement, and the adrenaline was flowing.

101
00:19:04,813 --> 00:19:10,515
[SPEAKER_05]: We arrived home at about 10 p.m., and my father said it was time to go to bed.

102
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:14,396
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, Dad, I want to be the barometric.

103
00:19:15,616 --> 00:19:19,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said, go to bed, and we'll talk about it tomorrow night.

104
00:19:20,835 --> 00:19:26,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did talk every day until January 4th, 1988, when I was sworn in as your mayor.

105
00:19:27,659 --> 00:19:33,103
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a time when the economic conditions in the Commonwealth challenged the well-being of our city.

106
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:38,786
[SPEAKER_05]: People questioned if their elected officials could maintain the delivery of public services.

107
00:19:39,767 --> 00:19:47,432
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it is evident that together we have established a responsive government during times of continued economic stress.

108
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:55,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I have never been paralyzed by conflicting views, nor have I avoided the responsibility of making hard choices.

109
00:19:56,377 --> 00:20:01,679
[SPEAKER_05]: The financial stability of this community is paramount to its future success.

110
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:10,702
[SPEAKER_05]: My experience has been earned because of the commitment and the support you have shown towards my tenure in public office.

111
00:20:11,683 --> 00:20:14,604
[SPEAKER_05]: For this, Sheila and I are truly grateful.

112
00:20:15,624 --> 00:20:16,885
[SPEAKER_05]: Your friendship guidance,

113
00:20:17,636 --> 00:20:19,237
[SPEAKER_05]: shall never be forgotten.

114
00:20:20,358 --> 00:20:29,324
[SPEAKER_05]: The road has been a very enjoyable one, steeped in hard work, tough decisions, and on occasion, a bit of controversy.

115
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:33,587
[SPEAKER_05]: But the results have always been rewarding.

116
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:43,814
[SPEAKER_05]: We have forged partnerships with employees, volunteers, nonprofits, elected officials, the business community, and the residents of our great city.

117
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:47,076
[SPEAKER_05]: As we look back on what we have accomplished,

118
00:20:48,152 --> 00:20:59,337
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems so simple, yet every program, every bit of construction or reconstruction was met with some type of opposition.

119
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:04,839
[SPEAKER_05]: However, we continue to forge ahead as a team for the public good.

120
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:12,743
[SPEAKER_05]: Three examples of this team effort include Rivers Edge, Station Landing, and the Old Mosque site.

121
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:17,245
[SPEAKER_05]: The Rivers Edge development in Wellington was a Bronzeville site.

122
00:21:18,035 --> 00:21:19,776
[SPEAKER_05]: in dire need of rehabilitation.

123
00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:30,704
[SPEAKER_05]: The area had been the site where trash would be placed on a barge on the Malden River, floated to Boston Harbor, torched, and dumped in the water.

124
00:21:31,785 --> 00:21:35,667
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a place where the orange-blue-red water, full of toxins, flowed.

125
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:41,812
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a site where businesses freely dumped their waste into the ground or the river,

126
00:21:42,841 --> 00:21:47,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Because until the early 70s, there was no Environmental Protection Agency.

127
00:21:49,168 --> 00:21:52,792
[SPEAKER_05]: The stench when the earth was moved would make you nauseous.

128
00:21:53,954 --> 00:21:54,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Working together,

129
00:21:55,612 --> 00:22:02,895
[SPEAKER_05]: We remediated it into a site and a parcel that now offers luxury housing with an affordable component.

130
00:22:03,575 --> 00:22:06,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Created hundreds of construction and permanent jobs.

131
00:22:07,137 --> 00:22:14,240
[SPEAKER_05]: Companies that moved in include the Marriott Corporation, Cogenica from Spain, Lab Think from China.

132
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:20,623
[SPEAKER_05]: It quadrupled the amount of tax dollars that we were previously getting.

133
00:22:21,575 --> 00:22:29,277
[SPEAKER_05]: A boathouse was built here with college and high school teams hosting regattas, and spectators lining the river to cheer on their favorite teams.

134
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:34,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Medford Heights crew teams have excelled in many competitions.

135
00:22:35,739 --> 00:22:41,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Station Landing is the site where the backside of the property had been seized up.

136
00:22:42,681 --> 00:22:48,403
[SPEAKER_05]: We worked with National Development to remediate the waste and create a transit-oriented development.

137
00:22:49,373 --> 00:22:56,538
[SPEAKER_05]: The revenues from the building permits and linkage payments helped to offset lost revenues during the recession.

138
00:22:58,219 --> 00:23:03,502
[SPEAKER_05]: We created jobs, housing opportunities, and increased tax revenues dramatically.

139
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:08,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Today, Station Landing is our number one employer in the city of Medford.

140
00:23:10,186 --> 00:23:15,490

141
00:23:16,626 --> 00:23:26,432
[SPEAKER_05]: We worked with the Building the Future Committee, the Racial Balance Committee, the Reuse Committee, and many more to look at the possibility of a new configuration for schools on that site.

142
00:23:27,472 --> 00:23:30,534
[SPEAKER_05]: It was controversial, and it had many moving parts.

143
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:36,397
[SPEAKER_05]: After 150 public meetings and hearings, we reached a consensus to build.

144
00:23:37,258 --> 00:23:39,339
[SPEAKER_05]: We worked with the state to remediate the area.

145
00:23:40,007 --> 00:23:49,332
[SPEAKER_05]: secured our approval of a 90% reimbursement for the construction costs, and purchased the 47.9 acres from the state for $1.

146
00:23:49,412 --> 00:23:59,377
[SPEAKER_05]: We secured a million dollar grant to build Mr. Grimm and Ben Pocky, including a canoe launch, seeding areas, pathways, and many plantings.

147
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:05,200
[SPEAKER_05]: We added an outdoor stream harking rink, new soccer fields, little league fields, community gardens,

148
00:24:06,087 --> 00:24:12,931
[SPEAKER_05]: and two new awesome schools, a wind turbine, a stadium seating, a track, and a turf field.

149
00:24:13,811 --> 00:24:18,353
[SPEAKER_05]: We took over the management of La Conte Rink and resurfaced the stadium's parking lot.

150
00:24:19,314 --> 00:24:25,537
[SPEAKER_05]: When we finished building all of the new schools and selling the old ones, we actually made money.

151
00:24:26,818 --> 00:24:30,540
[SPEAKER_05]: Together, we remediated and recycled all three sites.

152
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:36,201
[SPEAKER_05]: They now offer us economic, environmental, recreation, and educational opportunities.

153
00:24:38,023 --> 00:24:49,052
[SPEAKER_05]: In recent years, articles in the Boston Globe, Boston Magazine, and Menford Real Estate website have shown Menford to be among the best places to live, starting out.

154
00:24:49,072 --> 00:24:58,140
[SPEAKER_05]: They describe it as Menford, a Mecca for young urban buyers, offering open space, a happening restaurant scene, plus two new waterfront

00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:06,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Redfin Center of Medford, a highly desirable neighborhood with an easy commute to Boston.

156
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:11,102
[SPEAKER_05]: It has a very suburban atmosphere with great parks.

157
00:25:12,382 --> 00:25:25,045
[SPEAKER_05]: The third phase of Bird's Edge development includes a mixed-use structure with apartments, commercial, and restaurant space, as well as an affordable housing component to accommodate all of those new millennials.

159
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:55,453

[SPEAKER_05]: In the last few weeks, Memphis Square has witnessed

172

176
00:27:31,772 --> 00:27:34,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Permanent and linkage fees collected over the last 24 months.

177
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:43,666
[SPEAKER_05]: totaled over $6 million, and over the next 24 months had the potential of an additional $6 million.

178
00:27:43,866 --> 00:27:47,147
[SPEAKER_05]: Our public safety sector remained strong.

179
00:27:47,788 --> 00:27:53,770

[SPEAKER_05]: The director will work on prevention, intervention, and support with individuals, families, school, and the community at large.

192
00:29:08,045 --> 00:29:10,186
[SPEAKER_05]: grants, goodwill, and compassion.

193
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:27,453
[SPEAKER_05]: We negotiated an agreement with Tufts to create a neighborhood improvement fund in the amount of $525,000 and a yearly payment in lieu of taxes for a future building above the new T Station at College and Boston Avenue.

194
00:29:28,674 --> 00:29:33,656

198
00:30:01,324 --> 00:30:03,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Our class sizes are excellent.

199
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:06,768
[SPEAKER_05]: Our athletes have some of the best facilities in the region.

200
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:17,837
[SPEAKER_05]: We offer extensive after-school programs, all while maintaining a comprehensive curriculum, which includes arts, music, and advanced placement programs.

201
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:23,542
[SPEAKER_05]: This year, we opened our new Department of Public Works building, replacing the 1930s WPA project.

202
00:30:26,675 --> 00:30:34,440
[SPEAKER_05]: which now offers a safer work environment and better opportunities for the DPW employees to do their job.

203
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:50,550
[SPEAKER_05]: We have held golf tournaments, state dinners, built public and private partnerships, and accepted donations to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to build the finest veteran monuments in the commonwealth to honor the bravery and sacrifice of our veterans.

204
00:30:51,728 --> 00:30:54,973
[SPEAKER_05]: We have bonded for nearly $30 million in the last couple of years.

205
00:30:55,633 --> 00:30:58,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Our rating is still strong and our indebtedness is still low.

206
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:03,664
[SPEAKER_05]: To answer the question, what is the state of our city?

207
00:31:04,646 --> 00:31:06,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm here to tell you it is excellent.

208
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:34,065
[SPEAKER_05]: At the start of the recession, Richard Lee and I made a commitment to raise our reserves in order to fight the ills of recessionary times off in the future.

209
00:31:34,085 --> 00:31:38,387
[SPEAKER_05]: I am excited to announce that our reserves continue to grow.

210
00:31:38,908 --> 00:31:43,850
[SPEAKER_05]: And as of June 30, the sale of real estate hit $400,000 in the account.

211
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,752
[SPEAKER_05]: The water and sewer retained earnings, $7.7 million.

[SPEAKER_05]: Linkage funds, $1.827 million.

213

[SPEAKER_05]: free cash, $9.873 million.

214
00:31:57,856 --> 00:32:02,279
[SPEAKER_05]: Our negotiated agreement with the casinos brings in $1 million yearly.

215
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,662
[SPEAKER_05]: This represents over $20 million in reserve.

216
00:32:06,162 --> 00:32:13,047
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition, the Community Preservation Act could provide up to $6 million over five years.

217
00:32:13,407 --> 00:32:16,870
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did it together during tough fiscal times.

218
00:32:17,817 --> 00:32:26,464
[SPEAKER_05]: I have often stated that there will be no retreat from excellence, no acceptance of mediocrity, and no compromise of the public good.

219
00:32:27,324 --> 00:32:37,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Now is the time to move the equivalent dollar amount of 5% of our operating budget from our reserves into the stabilization account.

220
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:50,195
[SPEAKER_05]: and we will become an even stronger community fiscally, yet still have significant reserves and a strong forecast for future growth.

221
00:32:51,896 --> 00:33:02,422
[SPEAKER_05]: I've always said that the two things that I have enjoyed most while serving as mayor are traveling to the schools to speak to the students about their ideas for the city's future.

222
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:08,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Topics have ranged from designing products to discussing government itself.

223
00:33:09,468 --> 00:33:15,011
[SPEAKER_05]: The other is having the opportunity to worship in every church and temple in this community.

224
00:33:16,091 --> 00:33:18,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Methodist clergy are a tight-knit group.

225
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:21,914
[SPEAKER_05]: They minister and worship together.

226
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:32,300
[SPEAKER_05]: That is healthy because it allows congregants and parishioners the opportunity to worship with members of other churches, to better understand one another,

227
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,041
[SPEAKER_05]: in our community.

228
00:33:34,701 --> 00:33:43,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Diversity grows every day when people from different countries and different faiths come together, and this only makes us stronger as a community.

229
00:33:45,972 --> 00:33:51,116
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this job as much today as I did the first day that I was sworn in.

230
00:33:52,637 --> 00:34:05,408
[SPEAKER_05]: I love the veterans' ceremonies, the parades, the community days, the carnivals, the senior picnics, the Boston Pops, the Mount Rushmore flag, the Black Hawk helicopter, the 105-millimeter howitzers, and even the fireworks.

231
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:10,593
[SPEAKER_05]: But not as much as I love each and every one of you.

232
00:34:11,874 --> 00:34:12,794
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it a blast?

233
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:56,781
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I have an opportunity to do a few introductions now.

234
00:34:57,541 --> 00:35:04,968
[SPEAKER_05]: The first group I want to introduce is a group who has been so loyal and faithful, not only to me, but to the entire city.

235
00:35:04,988 --> 00:35:11,974
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're a group who, on occasion, are picked on by others.

236
00:35:13,075 --> 00:35:17,178
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have never paid any attention to it, they've just gone forward and they've done their job.

237
00:35:17,378 --> 00:35:19,000
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the staff in the office.

238
00:35:32,077 --> 00:35:33,518
[SPEAKER_05]: So, look around here.

239
00:35:33,558 --> 00:35:34,799
[SPEAKER_05]: You think I had a shot in the office?

240
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:35,319
[SPEAKER_05]: All women.

241
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:42,084
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I will start with Richie Lee, who was the last city manager during the city.

242
00:35:57,592 --> 00:36:03,354
[SPEAKER_05]: And Richie was a person who was low-key, had a dry sense of humor, but was very funny.

243
00:36:04,055 --> 00:36:05,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was very bright.

244
00:36:06,476 --> 00:36:11,778
[SPEAKER_05]: And he did a great job on the buddies and the personal matters for a long time before his passing.

245
00:36:11,798 --> 00:36:14,039
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's represented here by his wife, Sherry Sherry.

246
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:31,906
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other writers were Fran and Marilyn Cronin, and Marilyn was a very hard-working individual, a good friend of all of us, and she is no longer with us.

247
00:36:32,847 --> 00:36:37,350
[SPEAKER_05]: But Fran Ginetti is, and she was accompanied by Maureen Shea.

248
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:46,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's what happened with the two anemones.

249
00:36:47,393 --> 00:36:59,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I was there, it was probably around March 15th, we were at the IFA March, and Frank came in the office one day and she said to me, I'll give you a little bit of that song, Mr. Big Shot, Who Do You Think You Are?

250
00:37:00,782 --> 00:37:02,703
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said, who do you think you are?

251
00:37:03,663 --> 00:37:04,704
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, what do you mean?

252
00:37:05,344 --> 00:37:05,885
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said,

253
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:08,904
[SPEAKER_05]: These people, they don't even know you.

254
00:37:08,944 --> 00:37:10,746
[SPEAKER_05]: You haven't taken the time to go out and to meet them.

255
00:37:10,786 --> 00:37:12,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, I've got a job to do.

256
00:37:12,347 --> 00:37:13,668
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm straightening the city out.

257
00:37:14,048 --> 00:37:21,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said, well, go straighten it out by signing to get to know the people who work for you, what their abilities are, and move forward.

258
00:37:21,914 --> 00:37:28,458
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, I don't know this, but I think she must have gone and talked to Bob O'Brien, who was the Commissioner of Public Works at the time.

259
00:37:29,219 --> 00:37:31,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Because he walked in 10 minutes later, and he looked at me and he said,

260
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:39,749
[SPEAKER_05]: man, you have to earn that respect in the job you do as a man.

261
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:52,837
[SPEAKER_05]: So friends... I always tell people the best advice I got in all those years in the office.

262
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:59,300
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, one day Maureen comes in and she said, you're not going to believe this, Matt Masterson is outside.

263
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, I know my calories.

264
00:38:03,258 --> 00:38:05,819
[SPEAKER_05]: So I said, Bat Masterson, this is a big deal.

265
00:38:05,939 --> 00:38:11,941
[SPEAKER_05]: So I looked up and I said, that's not Bat Masterson, that's Wyatt Earp.

266
00:38:13,502 --> 00:38:16,723
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wasn't Gene Barry, it was Jewel Bryant, but Wyatt Earp was there.

267
00:38:16,743 --> 00:38:19,344
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't ask him to speak at a conference up at Tufts.

268
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:23,525
[SPEAKER_05]: And you had kids who were probably 16, 17, 18 years of age.

269
00:38:24,186 --> 00:38:29,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So I went up there, and I've got to tell you, Wyatt was one of my guys from the time I was a little guy.

270
00:38:31,788 --> 00:38:34,069
[SPEAKER_05]: The first thing I did was I sang the wider up song.

271
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:39,332
[SPEAKER_05]: There's 400 kids in this auditorium.

272
00:38:39,352 --> 00:38:43,053
[SPEAKER_05]: When I finished, they're all staring at me with a blank face.

273
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:46,375
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't even know what it was.

274
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:47,275
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Stephanie Berwick.

275
00:38:47,376 --> 00:38:51,618
Stephanie Berwick, that's who made it, came along, and she took over the repertoire.

276
00:39:08,496 --> 00:39:09,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell you why she had the job.

277
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,198
[SPEAKER_05]: And I told this story one day.

278
00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:20,121
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, because you're the only person when Richie and I try to trick you on the budgets, you look and you balance every account.

279
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:21,161
[SPEAKER_05]: No one else does that.

280
00:39:21,181 --> 00:39:22,141
[SPEAKER_05]: They say, cut a million out.

281
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:23,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Cut a million out of me.

282
00:39:24,122 --> 00:39:28,564
[SPEAKER_05]: She looked at every line item, and she knew where we were hiding the money.

283
00:39:30,492 --> 00:39:32,372
[SPEAKER_05]: So we happened to do a bottle project.

284
00:39:32,693 --> 00:39:36,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And I always turned to Richie and said, Richie, did you make a mistake?

285
00:39:36,594 --> 00:39:38,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Richie said, I guess I did.

286
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:41,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Stephanie, thank you for your honor.

287
00:39:48,496 --> 00:39:59,079
[SPEAKER_05]: And Luis Cowan, who is now the new budget director, has done a great job with all the personnel matters and the budgets, as you can see, because between the both of them, we're in great shape.

288
00:40:04,484 --> 00:40:07,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Then there was Adeline, this is a couple of the problem.

289
00:40:07,526 --> 00:40:11,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And Addie, this is an out of the office story.

290
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:16,791
[SPEAKER_05]: One day I'm over at her house and we're gonna have a pasta dinner and she forgot one of the ingredients.

291
00:40:17,111 --> 00:40:18,852
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is how she is in the office too.

292
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:20,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Very pushy, tells you what to do.

293
00:40:22,474 --> 00:40:25,916
[SPEAKER_05]: So she said to me, come over here to the stove, just come over here.

294
00:40:26,116 --> 00:40:26,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, what?

295
00:40:26,456 --> 00:40:27,697
[SPEAKER_05]: She said, keep stirring the sauce.

296
00:40:27,717 --> 00:40:29,978
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, how long should I stir it?

297
00:40:29,998 --> 00:40:30,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Stir it.

298
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:32,280
[SPEAKER_05]: She said, don't stop until I get back.

299
00:40:34,177 --> 00:40:35,580
[SPEAKER_05]: She was gone for 25 minutes.

300
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I was gone for a couple of ton or whatever that is.

301
00:40:39,066 --> 00:40:41,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Very loyal, great person.

302
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:55,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Lisa Vangelista, I'm a state representative here.

303
00:40:55,128 --> 00:40:58,452
[SPEAKER_05]: She was my secretary back then when we were in the statehouse.

304
00:40:58,953 --> 00:41:03,899
[SPEAKER_05]: And this young student from the Northeast pushed her way into the office and said, I want to be your intern.

305
00:41:03,939 --> 00:41:04,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to work here.

306
00:41:05,441 --> 00:41:07,043
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we hired her.

307
00:41:07,263 --> 00:41:09,506
[SPEAKER_05]: And she did a great job as an intern.

308
00:41:10,807 --> 00:41:15,411
[SPEAKER_05]: but the job she's done here for the city of Medford is unbelievable.

309
00:41:15,471 --> 00:41:19,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the person who walks in, gets the credit for everything that happens.

310
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:25,340
[SPEAKER_05]: She's the person who sweats here all night and all week to make sure all the details are together.

311
00:41:25,881 --> 00:41:33,528
[SPEAKER_05]: She does yell at me in private because of some of the things that I get her into, but she does an excellent job and I thank her for it.

312
00:41:58,344 --> 00:42:00,025
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have Linda Colletti.

313
00:42:01,506 --> 00:42:03,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And Linda Colletti used to work upstairs.

314
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:04,388
[SPEAKER_05]: She was in Public Works.

315
00:42:05,168 --> 00:42:07,650
[SPEAKER_05]: And here's my summation of Linda Colletti.

316
00:42:09,211 --> 00:42:13,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I asked her for an hour one day, and I said, Linda, would you like to work in this office?

317
00:42:14,394 --> 00:42:16,115
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said, yes, I think I would.

318
00:42:16,275 --> 00:42:21,418
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, but the problem is, you're never going to get rich in public service, and it doesn't pay a lot of money.

319
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:26,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other employees out there listening, pay attention to this.

320
00:42:26,907 --> 00:42:34,092
[SPEAKER_05]: He said, I don't care about the money, but I know I can help more people by working in this office, in our community.

321
00:42:34,813 --> 00:42:35,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Linda, thank you very much.

322
00:42:47,361 --> 00:42:48,682
[SPEAKER_05]: The Commander in Chief.

323
00:42:48,762 --> 00:42:49,283
[SPEAKER_05]: For 39 years.

324
00:42:53,788 --> 00:42:56,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I can probably say this publicly, right?

325
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,751
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary's referred to in City Hall as my work wife.

326
00:43:00,132 --> 00:43:04,794
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have my home wife.

327
00:43:05,135 --> 00:43:08,216
[SPEAKER_05]: And there are a lot of similarities between the two.

328
00:43:09,057 --> 00:43:12,138
[SPEAKER_05]: They both have this thing that when you, they say, would you do something?

329
00:43:12,579 --> 00:43:14,520
[SPEAKER_05]: You say, yes, let me go over and I'll start on it.

330
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,662
[SPEAKER_05]: And as you're trying to do that, they give you four other things to do.

331
00:43:19,591 --> 00:43:37,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But Mary has been with me for 39 years, and she's the person who would, and I know you won't believe this, but sometimes when people come into the office and they're upset, and maybe they use a language that they shouldn't, and they're yelling and screaming, Mary would say, are you having a bad date, dear?

332
00:43:40,922 --> 00:43:48,886
[SPEAKER_05]: But she would sit them down, and the next thing you know, I had this very quiet, relaxed person come in.

333
00:43:48,906 --> 00:43:51,327
[SPEAKER_05]: Plus, the other thing she always said was, I said, stop saying that.

334
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:53,048
[SPEAKER_05]: She said, don't worry, he'll fix it for you.

335
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:25,659
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to take a minute to introduce my family.

336
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:35,720
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the son of a man, and obviously I have my own children, so I know a little of what they've gone through.

337
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:39,461
[SPEAKER_05]: None of them ever remember me not being in elective office.

338
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:46,962
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those of us in elective office, the pressures on your children are immense.

339
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:50,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody always has something to say.

340
00:44:51,683 --> 00:44:59,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody always knows that they can get something done if they just go and pressure the kids to talk to the father to make sure that it happens.

341
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:03,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Those type of people really don't understand anything about it.

342
00:45:04,507 --> 00:45:10,630
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am so very proud of the way and the manner in which they've always conducted themselves, what they have achieved in life.

343
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:13,511
[SPEAKER_05]: Kathleen, Jennifer, and Amanda.

344
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:34,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard people say that you're lucky if you have a good son-in-law.

345
00:45:34,794 --> 00:45:36,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I'm fortunate.

346
00:45:36,656 --> 00:45:37,437
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two.

347
00:45:38,678 --> 00:45:43,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Aaron and Bill have always been there for the family, for my daughters, for my grandchildren.

348
00:45:44,723 --> 00:45:47,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're great people, too.

349
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:50,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you get to know them.

350
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:54,111
[SPEAKER_05]: It took me a little while to get to know Aaron.

351
00:45:54,131 --> 00:45:56,633
But Bill Brady and Aaron Belanger.

352
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:14,090
[SPEAKER_05]: I may have trouble here, but, and I'm working on a good son-in-law.

353
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:16,871
[SPEAKER_03]: That is Pat Michael Collins.

354
00:46:25,194 --> 00:46:26,734
[SPEAKER_05]: And Pat's a great guy.

355
00:46:26,754 --> 00:46:28,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Knows a lot about sports.

356
00:46:29,636 --> 00:46:33,957
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the first, I don't know, for the first two years, I was only allowed to call him PMC.

357
00:46:33,977 --> 00:46:35,338
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't even tell me his name.

358
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:39,379
[SPEAKER_05]: So one night, I thought I'd take a shot.

359
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:46,103
[SPEAKER_05]: We were at dinner, everyone was sitting around the table, and I said, show them Paul and Michael.

360
00:46:46,223 --> 00:46:51,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Amanda says, Dad, his name is Pat.

361
00:46:51,706 --> 00:46:58,930
[SPEAKER_05]: And you heard my brother referring to the five grandchildren.

362
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:02,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Cameron, Cameron, give me a wave, brother.

363
00:47:23,196 --> 00:47:26,539
[SPEAKER_05]: And Bambi Nora is asleep in the mayor's office.

364
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:34,866
[SPEAKER_05]: And just one other person that I would like to recognize, and that's our city solicitor, Mike Brumley, for the great friendship that we have had over the years.

365
00:47:45,468 --> 00:47:49,630
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to ruin his image, but I want to tell you a secret.

366
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:54,532
[SPEAKER_05]: He acts like a tough guy, but he's a cream puff.

367
00:47:54,552 --> 00:48:00,154
[SPEAKER_05]: He's one of the most caring, compassionate people you'll ever meet, and he'll always reach out to do whatever he can for you.

368
00:48:00,754 --> 00:48:01,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Think about it.

369
00:48:01,194 --> 00:48:04,595
[SPEAKER_05]: He's not only a solicitor, but he's a deacon of the church, too.

370
00:48:14,383 --> 00:48:16,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to the whole night band.

371
00:48:16,165 --> 00:48:24,936
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you to Manish King.

372
00:48:25,016 --> 00:48:25,337
What?

373
00:48:25,517 --> 00:48:26,017
[SPEAKER_06]: You're white.

374
00:48:26,618 --> 00:48:26,658
Oh.

375
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I think I did this on January 4th, 1988.

376
00:48:51,147 --> 00:48:54,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, more things change the more you're in the same.

377
00:48:55,191 --> 00:48:59,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so I have one more thing I'd like to do.

378
00:48:59,215 --> 00:49:02,759
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Sheila?

379
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:26,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I think some of you know the story that Shel and I grew up next door to each other.

380
00:49:26,574 --> 00:49:27,834
[SPEAKER_05]: We dated for a decade.

381
00:49:28,194 --> 00:49:32,136
[SPEAKER_05]: They kept sending me further away to school after school, so we couldn't get married.

382
00:49:32,196 --> 00:49:33,557
[SPEAKER_05]: We were in high school to college.

383
00:49:34,337 --> 00:49:36,078
[SPEAKER_05]: My senior year was when I graduated.

384
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,659
[SPEAKER_05]: We were married and had a beautiful family.

385
00:49:39,159 --> 00:49:42,961
[SPEAKER_05]: And one day I went to her and I said, Shel, I think I'd like to run for mayor.

386
00:49:43,821 --> 00:49:46,182
[SPEAKER_05]: And she said, well, how long do you think you'd like to do that?

387
00:49:46,602 --> 00:49:49,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, I don't know, two years.

388
00:49:51,905 --> 00:50:00,047
[SPEAKER_05]: In my legislative time, in my mayoral time, never once has she ever complained.

389
00:50:01,347 --> 00:50:13,530
[SPEAKER_05]: She is my sister.

390
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:18,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Honey, watch how mature I become over the years.

391
00:50:18,851 --> 00:50:19,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I love you, honey.

392
00:50:31,717 --> 00:50:36,939
[SPEAKER_05]: And my brothers and sisters, Jackie, Dickie, Karen, Bernadette, and Kevin.

393
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:55,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for being here, all my aunts and uncles.

394
00:50:55,547 --> 00:50:58,468
[SPEAKER_04]: You never like following him.

395
00:51:01,188 --> 00:51:01,729
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.

396
00:51:01,749 --> 00:51:06,057
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford Alumni Band of America the Beautiful.

397
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:19,253
[SPEAKER_04]: And now for the benediction, I invite up someone that's become a good friend of mine through the mayor, and that is Geshe Teng.

398
00:52:19,293 --> 00:52:19,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Geshe?

399
00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:56,844
[SPEAKER_01]: I also, I would like to say, all my family members in Manful City is really my family.

400
00:52:58,005 --> 00:52:59,406
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my dad, mayor.

401
00:53:09,174 --> 00:53:12,757
[SPEAKER_01]: He cares our city, his activities.

402
00:53:13,077 --> 00:53:16,280
[SPEAKER_01]: No one, I believe, is a very good person.

403
00:53:16,580 --> 00:53:18,442
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to say, thank all the

404
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:23,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Officials, guests, friends, thank you.

405
00:53:23,903 --> 00:53:33,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, our Tibetan tradition, whenever we do some things, start, we do also auspicious words today.

406
00:53:33,792 --> 00:53:37,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Also when we dance, also we do auspicious words.

407
00:53:41,191 --> 00:53:44,373
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, we going to second stop.

408
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:49,958
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like to, he did two, eight years serve our family.

409
00:53:50,458 --> 00:53:53,180
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to do auspicious purposes.

410
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,024
[SPEAKER_01]: And meaning is auspicious morning, auspicious day, auspicious night.

411
00:53:58,684 --> 00:54:00,886
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do Tibetan.

412
00:54:01,046 --> 00:54:02,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry my English is very poor.

413
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:03,648
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do Tibetan.

414
00:54:10,256 --> 00:54:11,997
Thank you.

415
00:54:54,622 --> 00:54:57,323
[SPEAKER_04]: to do it again now that you said something.

416
00:54:57,403 --> 00:55:01,924
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to make sure that I gave this introduction earlier, but I'm pretty sure I did.

417
00:55:02,325 --> 00:55:04,685
[SPEAKER_04]: Our district attorney is with us, Marion Ryan.

418
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:16,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And Reneece King is still with us.

419
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:24,072
[SPEAKER_04]: And Reneece King will be accompanied by the medical alumni band, God Bless America.

420
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:06,570
just a bit

421
00:56:41,694 --> 00:56:45,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Denise, and thank you very much once again to the Medford Alumni Band.

422
00:57:46,622 --> 00:57:47,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

423
00:58:29,106 --> 00:58:30,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you again to the men from the 1-9 team.

424
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:39,772
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, almost done.

425
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:40,813
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of things.

426
00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:46,156
[SPEAKER_04]: First, I would ask that you remain in your seats while the people behind the rail are able to get out.

427
00:58:46,176 --> 00:58:49,518
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a bit cumbersome, as you can see with all of you here today.

428
00:58:49,798 --> 00:58:50,859
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's wonderful that way.

429
00:58:51,435 --> 00:58:54,837
[SPEAKER_04]: So we ask that you remain seated while those behind the rail have exited.

430
00:58:54,857 --> 00:59:11,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And immediately following this ceremony, all are welcome to join Ma'am McGlynn, Sheila, and the McGlynn family at a farewell reception at Monfield Plaza, 54 Monfield Avenue in Stoneham, and we thank you.
