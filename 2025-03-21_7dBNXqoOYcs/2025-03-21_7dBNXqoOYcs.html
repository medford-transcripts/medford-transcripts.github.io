    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=11.879s">We</a>  have with us this afternoon State Senator Patricia Jalen, Sheriff Peter Katushin. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=20.845s">Please</a>  be seated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=22.806s">State</a>  Representatives Paul Donato, Sean Garbani, and Christine Barber. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=35.535s">We</a>  have Pat Jalen's been announced. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=37.436s">Yes,</a>  come on in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=45.681s">We</a>  also have with us this afternoon, Mayor-elect Stephanie Muccini-Burke. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=70.837s">and</a>  Medford City Councilors, Adam Knight, Richard Cargill. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=104.037s">and</a>  members of the Midship School Committee, John Falco, David George Stout, Marlene Sterling, Erin DiBenedetto, and my wife, Ann Marie. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=139.307s">Now,</a>  before I introduce the mayor and the others, the reason that this looked a little disjointed is because I was going to shake things up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=151.591s">But</a>  it didn't work out that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=153.211s">So</a>  you'll have to forgive me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=154.412s">But</a>  I'm going to do it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=156.653s">Because</a>  I thought that in almost every event of this kind, what we've heard in the past is the elected officials invited name first, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=167.96s">That's</a>  the end of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=169.181s">Well,</a>  I'm going to change tradition a little bit because a good friend of mine whom I miss so much said just once in his life, he would like to have heard others named at events like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=182.79s">Today's</a>  the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=186.933s">The</a>  first group, and I'm not going to name the names, I'm just going to talk about the group. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=191.956s">The</a>  first group is the foundation or cornerstone of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=197.289s">They</a>  work where the rubber meets the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=200.831s">They're</a>  often the first faces that people will see when they come into City Hall, the school department, the library, the council on aging, or the public safety departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=211.756s">And</a>  they're usually the first voices you'll hear on the telephone when you call these places. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=217.319s">They</a>  serve the people of Medford with humility and dignity, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=222.453s">My</a>  friends, I'm referring to the members of our clerical staff, the secretaries, and administrative assistants. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=268.364s">Next,</a>  I'd like to acknowledge those people who shape our young people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=273.087s">They</a>  encourage them to dream and to achieve, and I'm talking about our teachers, our teachers' age, coaches, and instructors in the Medford Public Schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=298.785s">protect</a>  us day in and day out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=301.447s">Their</a>  hours of service are the same as the number of hours in the day. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=305.27s">Now</a>  this isn't the only guy that I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=307.211s">They'll</a>  come up in a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=308.793s">I'm</a>  talking about the members of our police and fire departments <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=332.162s">It</a>  wouldn't be complete without pointing to those who keep our municipal services running and they do so many things that they can't easily be listed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=340.845s">They</a>  do it in the heat of July and the freezing temperatures of the winter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=345.207s">The</a>  members of our Department of Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=360.948s">We</a>  also need to acknowledge and we can't forget those residents who take the time out of their lives to serve the city by accepting appointments to our various boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=370.74s">They're</a>  saying yes to service is vital to the proper workings of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=376.166s">I</a>  ask that you acknowledge the members of our many boards and commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=390.839s">The</a>  next group I ask you, and we're getting towards the end, the next group that I ask you to acknowledge, the public doesn't always understand fully the demands that are placed on this group, but I have observed this group for over 30 years, and I can best describe them as creative leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=407.489s">Their</a>  work is characterized by honesty, strength, and professionalism. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=415.06s">I</a>  am honored to work in collaboration with them every single day, and I am blessed to call each of them my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=422.321s">And</a>  I'm talking, of course, about my colleagues, the department heads at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=438.364s">One</a>  more program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=440.145s">I</a>  added this this morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=442.877s">Before</a>  I ask Mayor McGlynn and the others to come in, I want to respectfully acknowledge all those people who ran for public office, especially this year, the ones that had the courage to put their hat in the ring, whether they won or they didn't win, because their participation keeps the democratic process vibrant and alive for all those who chose to run for public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=483.85s">I</a>  think I've kept the mayor waiting long enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=488.753s">So,</a>  I would ask you all, as you have, to please rise and welcome Mayor Michael J. McGlynn, Mrs. Sheila McGlynn, escorted by Romeo Roberts, Sean Freeman, Geshe Tenley, Roy Nelson, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=617.71s">Romeo</a>  Robbins, a fifth grader at the Andrews Middle School. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=641.939s">and</a>  to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=657.107s">Romeo</a>  is a dear friend of Mayor McGlynn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=659.788s">He's</a>  from Antigua, and he keeps the mayor posted about the condition of the beaches in the Caribbean. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=675.76s">I</a>  would now like to welcome Renise King, the 2011 Boston Music Award winner for Gospel Inspirational Artist of the Year, and a featured performer for the Boston Parks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=690.334s">Renise</a>  also serves as musical director at the Waymark Seventh Day Adventist Church in Dorchester, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=697.737s">And</a>  she is the director of the Honor Union Choir and associate director of music at the United Methodist Church in Boston.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=727.137s">And</a>  the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=795.588s">As</a>  we gather ourselves in silence,</p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=822.657s">And</a>  I ask Reverend Noah Evans, the pastor of the Grace Episcopal Church, to deliver the invocation.</p>

    <p>[Noah Evans]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=838.422s">Loving</a>  God, in the scriptures you say, seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you, and pray to the Lord on his behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=851.226s">for</a>  in its welfare you find your welfare. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=855.589s">Behold</a>  and visit, we pray, the cities of the earth, especially Medford, this our home. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=862.613s">Renew</a>  the ties of mutual regard which form our civic life. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=868.276s">Send</a>  us honest and able leaders. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=871.338s">Enable</a>  us to eliminate poverty, prejudice, and oppression, that peace may prevail with righteousness and justice of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=880.837s">and</a>  that men and women from different cultures and with differing talents may find with one another the fulfillment of their humanity. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=890.699s">And</a>  today, especially, bless our mayor, Michael. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=894.839s">Bless</a>  him for his many years of commitment and service to our city and community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=901.04s">Help</a>  him to know your gratitude and our gratitude for all he has done and accomplished. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=908.782s">We</a>  ask this <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=910.325s">through</a>  our one holy and living God. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=913.026s">Amen.</a> </p>

    <p>[Mark Rumley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=915.866s">I'm</a>  getting my direction from the mayor right behind me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=920.187s">It's</a>  not the first time, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=922.727s">Ladies</a>  and gentlemen, I've known Michael McGlynn for many years, long before he was elected mayor of our city, going all the way back to high school days. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=935.47s">So</a>  there's much that I can say about him, but as is always the case, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=940.777s">It</a>  is his family that knows him best. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=943.458s">And</a>  if they were behind this microphone, they would say that he is a good son, a caring brother, a loving husband and father, and an extremely proud grandfather. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=963.685s">When</a>  his grandchildren are with him in City Hall, it's almost, he beams with joy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=970.997s">Light</a>  emanates from every part of his body when he's with his grandchildren. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=976.619s">At</a>  his core, that is genuinely who Michael McGlynn is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=983.841s">And</a>  for 28 years now, by their votes, the people of Medford have said another thing about him, and that is, he's a good man. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=995.486s">And</a>  I have been privileged to be part of his administration for each of those 28 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1000.89s">And</a>  because of that, I have some insight on why he has been such a good mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1006.814s">And</a>  the insight that I share with you is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1010.636s">That</a>  for every single day that Michael McGlynn has served the people of Medford as mayor, he has had only one goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1020.383s">And</a>  he has worked towards that goal with kindness, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1025.324s">honesty,</a>  and vigor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1029.066s">In</a>  every meeting that he has had with citizens, in every proposal that he has put forth, and in every project that he has initiated, his goal has been to build a better life for each and every resident of the city of Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1047.995s">Ladies</a>  and gentlemen, it is my sincere honor to welcome for his final State of the City Address, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1055.808s">Mayor</a>  Michael Chamberlain.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1105.94s">I</a>  have to tell you, I won't miss this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1107.621s">The</a>  music, the flag, and good friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1110.503s">Doesn't</a>  get much better than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1113.285s">Good</a>  afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1115.406s">I</a>  love hearing the stories from parents whose children have told them, when passing City Hall, that's where Mayim McGlynn lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1124.332s">And</a>  if you ask Sheila, she will probably tell you that that is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1128.134s">But</a>  on January 9th, 1961, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1136.251s">I</a>  met President John F. Kennedy with my father. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1139.512s">It</a>  was a day filled with excitement, and the adrenaline was flowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1144.813s">We</a>  arrived home at about 10 p.m., and my father said it was time to go to bed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1150.535s">And</a>  I said, Dad, I want to be the barometric. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1155.616s">And</a>  he said, go to bed, and we'll talk about it tomorrow night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1160.835s">And</a>  we did talk every day until January 4th, 1988, when I was sworn in as your mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1167.659s">It</a>  was a time when the economic conditions in the Commonwealth challenged the well-being of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1173.983s">People</a>  questioned if their elected officials could maintain the delivery of public services. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1179.767s">I</a>  believe it is evident that together we have established a responsive government during times of continued economic stress. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1188.614s">I</a>  have never been paralyzed by conflicting views, nor have I avoided the responsibility of making hard choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1196.377s">The</a>  financial stability of this community is paramount to its future success. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1202.799s">My</a>  experience has been earned because of the commitment and the support you have shown towards my tenure in public office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1211.683s">For</a>  this, Sheila and I are truly grateful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1215.624s">Your</a>  friendship guidance, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1217.636s">shall</a>  never be forgotten. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1220.358s">The</a>  road has been a very enjoyable one, steeped in hard work, tough decisions, and on occasion, a bit of controversy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1230.625s">But</a>  the results have always been rewarding. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1234.447s">We</a>  have forged partnerships with employees, volunteers, nonprofits, elected officials, the business community, and the residents of our great city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1245.075s">As</a>  we look back on what we have accomplished, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1248.152s">It</a>  seems so simple, yet every program, every bit of construction or reconstruction was met with some type of opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1260.217s">However,</a>  we continue to forge ahead as a team for the public good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1266.9s">Three</a>  examples of this team effort include Rivers Edge, Station Landing, and the Old Mosque site. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1273.983s">The</a>  Rivers Edge development in Wellington was a Bronzeville site. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1278.035s">in</a>  dire need of rehabilitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1280.597s">The</a>  area had been the site where trash would be placed on a barge on the Malden River, floated to Boston Harbor, torched, and dumped in the water. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1291.785s">It</a>  was a place where the orange-blue-red water, full of toxins, flowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1296.688s">It</a>  was a site where businesses freely dumped their waste into the ground or the river, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1302.841s">Because</a>  until the early 70s, there was no Environmental Protection Agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1309.168s">The</a>  stench when the earth was moved would make you nauseous. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1313.954s">Working</a>  together, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1315.612s">We</a>  remediated it into a site and a parcel that now offers luxury housing with an affordable component. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1323.575s">Created</a>  hundreds of construction and permanent jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1327.137s">Companies</a>  that moved in include the Marriott Corporation, Cogenica from Spain, Lab Think from China. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1334.26s">It</a>  quadrupled the amount of tax dollars that we were previously getting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1341.575s">A</a>  boathouse was built here with college and high school teams hosting regattas, and spectators lining the river to cheer on their favorite teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1350.298s">Medford</a>  Heights crew teams have excelled in many competitions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1355.739s">Station</a>  Landing is the site where the backside of the property had been seized up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1362.681s">We</a>  worked with National Development to remediate the waste and create a transit-oriented development. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1369.373s">The</a>  revenues from the building permits and linkage payments helped to offset lost revenues during the recession. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1378.219s">We</a>  created jobs, housing opportunities, and increased tax revenues dramatically. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1384.303s">Today,</a>  Station Landing is our number one employer in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1390.186s">The</a>  Old Marsh site, adjacent to Hormel Stadium, was also a bronze field. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1396.626s">We</a>  worked with the Building the Future Committee, the Racial Balance Committee, the Reuse Committee, and many more to look at the possibility of a new configuration for schools on that site. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1407.472s">It</a>  was controversial, and it had many moving parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1411.514s">After</a>  150 public meetings and hearings, we reached a consensus to build. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=1417.258s">We</a>  worked with the

href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2002.875s">That</a>  is healthy because it allows congregants and parishioners the opportunity to worship with members of other churches, to better understand one another, <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2013.22s">in</a>  our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2014.701s">Diversity</a>  grows every day when people from different countries and different faiths come together, and this only makes us stronger as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2025.972s">I</a>  love this job as much today as I did the first day that I was sworn in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2032.637s">I</a>  love the veterans' ceremonies, the parades, the community days, the carnivals, the senior picnics, the Boston Pops, the Mount Rushmore flag, the Black Hawk helicopter, the 105-millimeter howitzers, and even the fireworks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2046.529s">But</a>  not as much as I love each and every one of

I always tell people the best advice I got in all those years in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2273.397s">Now,</a>  one day Maureen comes in and she said, you're not going to believe this, Matt Masterson is outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2279.34s">Now,</a>  I know my calories. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2283.258s">So</a>  I said, Bat Masterson, this is a big deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2285.939s">So</a>  I looked up and I said, that's not Bat Masterson, that's Wyatt Earp. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2293.502s">So</a>  it wasn't Gene Barry, it was Jewel Bryant, but Wyatt Earp was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2296.743s">You</a>  can't ask him to speak at a conference up at Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2300.044s">And</a>  you had kids who were probably 16, 17, 18 years of age. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2304.186s">So</a>  I went up there, and I've got to tell you, Wyatt was one of my guys from the time I was a little guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2311.788s">The</a>  first thing I did was I sang the wider up song. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2314.509s">There's</a>  400 kids in this auditorium. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2319.352s">When</a>  I finished, they're all staring at me with a blank face.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2323.093s">They</a>  didn't even know what it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2326.535s">Oh,</a>  Stephanie Berwick.</p>

    <p>[TM-L7tQLt0w_SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2348.496s">And</a>  I can tell you why she had the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2351.057s">And</a>  I told this story one day. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2352.258s">I</a>  said, because you're the only person when Richie and I try to trick you on the budgets, you look and you balance every account. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2360.281s">No</a>  one else does that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2361.181s">They</a>  say, cut a million out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2362.201s">Cut</a>  a million out of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2364.122s">She</a>  looked at every line item, and she knew where we were hiding the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2370.492s">So</a>  we happened to do a bottle project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2372.693s">And</a>  I always turned to Richie and said, Richie, did you make a mistake? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2376.594s">Richie</a>  said, I guess I did. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2378.814s">Stephanie,</a>  thank you for your honor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2388.496s">And</a>  Luis Cowan, who is now the new budget director, has done a great job with all the personnel matters and the budgets, as you can see, because between the both of them, we're in great shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2404.484s">Then</a>  there was Adeline, this is a couple of the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2407.526s">And</a>  Addie, this is an out of the office story. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2411.868s">One</a>  day I'm over at her house and we're gonna have a pasta dinner and she forgot one of the ingredients. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2417.111s">And</a>  this is how she is in the office too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2419.192s">Very</a>  pushy, tells you what to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2422.474s">So</a>  she said to me, come over here to the stove, just come over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2426.116s">I</a>  said, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2426.456s">She</a>  said, keep stirring the sauce. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2427.717s">I</a>  said, how long should I stir it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2429.998s">Stir</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2430.239s">She</a>  said, don't stop until I get back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2434.177s">She</a>  was gone for 25 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2435.74s">I</a>  was gone for a couple of ton or whatever that is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2439.066s">Very</a>  loyal, great person. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2452.565s">Lisa</a>  Vangelista, I'm a state representative here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2455.128s">She</a>  was my secretary back then when we were in the statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2458.953s">And</a>  this young student from the Northeast pushed her way into the office and said, I want to be your intern. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2463.939s">I</a>  want to work here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2465.441s">And</a>  so we hired her. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2467.263s">And</a>  she did a great job as an intern. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2470.807s">but</a>  the job she's done here for the city of Medford is unbelievable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2475.471s">I'm</a>  the person who walks in, gets the credit for everything that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2479.675s">She's</a>  the person who sweats here all night and all week to make sure all the details are together. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2485.881s">She</a>  does yell at me in private because of some of the things that I get her into, but she does an excellent job and I thank her for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2518.344s">And</a>  then we have Linda Colletti. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2521.506s">And</a>  Linda Colletti used to work upstairs. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2523.207s">She</a>  was in Public Works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2525.168s">And</a>  here's my summation of Linda Colletti. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2529.211s">I</a>  asked her for an hour one day, and I said, Linda, would you like to work in this office? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2534.394s">And</a>  she said, yes, I think I would. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2536.275s">I</a>  said, but the problem is, you're never going to get rich in public service, and it doesn't pay a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2543.879s">Any</a>  other employees out there listening, pay attention to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2546.907s">He</a>  said, I don't care about the money, but I know I can help more people by working in this office, in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2554.813s">Linda,</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2567.361s">The</a>  Commander in Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2568.762s">For</a>  39 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2573.788s">I</a>  can probably say this publicly, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2577.21s">Mary's</a>  referred to in City Hall as my work wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2580.132s">And</a>  I have my home wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2585.135s">And</a>  there are a lot of similarities between the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2589.057s">They</a>  both have this thing that when you, they say, would you do something? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2592.579s">You</a>  say, yes, let me go over and I'll start on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2594.76s">And</a>  as you're trying to do that, they give you four other things to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2599.591s">But</a>  Mary has been with me for 39 years, and she's the person who would, and I know you won't believe this, but sometimes when people come into the office and they're upset, and maybe they use a language that they shouldn't, and they're yelling and screaming, Mary would say, are you having a bad date, dear? <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2620.922s">But</a>  she would sit them down, and the next thing you know, I had this very quiet, relaxed person come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2628.906s">Plus,</a>  the other thing she always said was, I said, stop saying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2631.567s">She</a>  said, don't worry, he'll fix it for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2661.458s">I'd</a>  like to take a minute to introduce my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2667.119s">I'm</a>  the son of a man, and obviously I have my own children, so I know a little of what they've gone through. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2676.421s">None</a>  of them ever remember me not being in elective office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2680.681s">And</a>  for those of us in elective office, the pressures on your children are immense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2688.083s">Everybody</a>  always has something to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2691.683s">Everybody</a>  always knows that they can get something done if they just go and pressure the kids to talk to the father to make sure that it happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2700.866s">Those</a>  type of people really don't understand anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2704.507s">But</a>  I am so very proud of the way and the manner in which they've always conducted themselves, what they have achieved in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2711.23s">Kathleen,</a>  Jennifer, and Amanda. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2732.012s">I've</a>  heard people say that you're lucky if you have a good son-in-law. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2734.794s">Well,</a>  I'm fortunate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2736.656s">I</a>  have two. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2738.678s">Aaron</a>  and Bill have always been there for the family, for my daughters, for my grandchildren. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2744.723s">And</a>  they're great people, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2747.445s">I</a>  mean, you get to know them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2751.049s">It</a>  took me a little while to get to know Aaron. <a href="https://youtu.be/7dBNXqoOYcs&t=2767.347s">I</a>  may have trouble here, but, and I'm working on a good son-in-law.</p>
