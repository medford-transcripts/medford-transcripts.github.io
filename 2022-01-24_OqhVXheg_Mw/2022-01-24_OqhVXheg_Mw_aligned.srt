1
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:33,305
a substantive change from what the policy used to be, or the policy was just sort of silent on how and when and why do subcommittees meet.

2
00:04:33,465 --> 00:04:44,468
So this says that subcommittees meet when business has been passed to them by the committee, which is consistent with typical legislative action.

3
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:53,850
And then other than that, I may have made some changes to like chairperson instead of chairman and those kinds of things.

4
00:04:54,553 --> 00:05:00,138
The cross references to other policies exist already and are part of the policy today.

5
00:05:00,158 --> 00:05:05,082
And I didn't make any changes to that.

6
00:05:05,182 --> 00:05:17,792
So the two substantive changes are just striking the names of those committees from the policy and clarifying how things can be discussed in subcommittee.

7
00:05:19,214 --> 00:05:26,920
And if I may, from the chair, just number three, it looks like we're missing a word or two within the last sentence.

8
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,682
Yes, it looks like it should say subcommittees will.

9
00:05:34,506 --> 00:05:38,529
And I think it's important to note that the policy says that today.

10
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:43,033
That is not an addition or a change to the policy.

11
00:05:44,915 --> 00:05:48,397
I know there were comments about that being confusing or like what that meant.

12
00:05:49,477 --> 00:05:52,339
I just want to point out that that is our policy today.

13
00:05:52,979 --> 00:06:01,463
So it is confusing, but it shouldn't preclude making the other changes that are listed here.

14
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,424
Thank you, Member Graham.

15
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:07,606
I'm not sure if Mr. McLaughlin is in there.

16
00:06:07,646 --> 00:06:11,007
It looks like this meeting is not on public access yet.

17
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:12,468
I know we're on Zoom.

18
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:15,728
Live on YouTube.

19
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:17,910
Okay.

20
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:32,781
Okay, so we're live on YouTube and on Zoom and... Member McLaughlin and then Member Kretz.

21
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:34,503
Thank you.

22
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,510
Thank you, Mayor.

23
00:06:37,532 --> 00:06:45,000
I did have a question on when the, will be provided with a list of its functions and duties to subcommittee by whom?

24
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,521
Who's gonna provide that?

25
00:06:46,561 --> 00:06:51,125
The whole committee or is someone being tasked to provide the list of functions?

26
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:56,110
In number three, I don't know who does that.

27
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:57,832
It is part of our policy today.

28
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:11,769
Right, so I think maybe we can clarify who's going to do that, because I think that would be important as we're giving, you know, if we're tasking somebody with providing a list of functions and duties for the subcommittee, we should have an idea of who's going to provide those.

29
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,351
It's number three, Mayor, the last sentence.

30
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:23,735
And then, Mayor, I also have a statement from the

31
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:33,704
Medford CPAC co-chairs that they asked me to read that they sent about an hour or two ago, because they're in route commuting and they don't want to do that from their car.

32
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:35,406
So if that's okay.

33
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:37,990
Hold on, I have to ask.

34
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,472
Before you do that, Ms.

35
00:07:39,512 --> 00:07:40,994
Wise, you've got that amendment.

36
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:41,715
Okay.

37
00:07:42,274 --> 00:07:44,896
Can you just read that amendment to me one more time so I can.

38
00:07:45,096 --> 00:07:45,497
Oh yeah.

39
00:07:45,977 --> 00:07:51,942
I think that it will be provided with the subcommittees will be provided with a list of its functions and duties, but I don't know by whom.

40
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:58,748
So I don't know if we want to do that as a committee now to decide by whom those functions and duties will be provided.

41
00:08:04,822 --> 00:08:16,333
I think in the past that the mayor had gone with what people thought were priorities and then named the subcommittees and then asked each of us which subcommittees we would like to be on.

42
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:21,899
I know the subcommittees have changed by title with different concerns that have come up in the previous year.

43
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:29,066
So I would say put the mayor for designating the names of the subcommittees.

44
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:35,034
Not the names, this is a list of its functions and duties through the chair.

45
00:08:35,714 --> 00:08:48,702
So yeah, the names definitely, and the assignments obviously we already have through the chair, but if we want the chair to be providing a list of the subcommittee's functions and duties, I guess is what I'm asking, or somebody else, I don't know.

46
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:53,385
Member Kretz and then Member Russo.

47
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:57,507
Just your microphone.

48
00:09:00,358 --> 00:09:00,878
Okay, sorry.

49
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:03,040
I have the same question that Ms.

50
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,760
McLaughlin had.

51
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:18,131
I did look at our upcoming agenda for this evening, and there's a resolution that Mr. Russo has put on with the list of functions and duties that he put together, a draft that he's proposing to us in a resolution.

52
00:09:18,631 --> 00:09:27,918
So I was wondering, and I know it would take time to probably have another committee of the whole to discuss the functions and duties that are proposed in that resolution.

53
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:52,828
You know, so I was wondering, you know, like for now, maybe we could remove that and put it back in so that we can, you know, kind of move forward with this resolution so that, you know, we can begin, you know, following the procedures of referring things to the subcommittee and going through scheduling that way.

54
00:09:57,285 --> 00:10:02,308
So potentially removing the sentence, subcommittees will be provided with a list of its functions and duties.

55
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:05,289
I'm fine with that amendment.

56
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:09,091
Okay, so Ms.

57
00:10:09,111 --> 00:10:11,853
Wise, you're going to strike the last sentence of number three.

58
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:17,796
Member McLaughlin.

59
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:19,977
Oh, sorry, Member Rousseau, then Member McLaughlin.

60
00:10:20,457 --> 00:10:21,378
I'm all set.

61
00:10:22,258 --> 00:10:22,878
Member McLaughlin.

62
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:23,979
Thank you.

63
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:25,220
Yeah, this is from

64
00:10:27,386 --> 00:10:39,012
The co-chairs of the Medford Special Education Parent Advisory Council, which is tasked through mass law to advise the district on matters pertaining to special education.

65
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:44,012
Special Education Parent Advisory Council CPAC statement.

66
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:47,975
We represent and advocate for Medford students with disabilities and their families.

67
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:57,463
The CPAC has concerns about the language that is proposed regarding school subcommittee meetings, specifically on how it affects the activity of the special education subcommittee.

68
00:10:58,203 --> 00:11:06,150
CPAC has advised and advocated with the school committee for many years, a forum needed to be created for a closer collaboration between school committee and CPAC.

69
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:12,272
a collaboration which is not optional but mandated by law per MAS statute chapter 71B section 3.

70
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:26,758
The parent advisory council duties shall include but are not limited to advising the school committee on matters that pertain to the education and safety of students with a disability, meeting regularly with school officials to participate in the planning and development of the school committee's special education programs.

71
00:11:27,678 --> 00:11:36,681
As a result of CPAC advocacy, the special education subcommittee was created in 2018 to fulfill this requirement of CPAC advising and collaborating with the school committee.

72
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:40,622
Back then we had a different mayor, a different superintendent, and a different school committee.

73
00:11:41,402 --> 00:11:49,905
The special education subcommittee works differently than other subcommittees because it has a different role, that of collaboration between school committee, CPAC, and the special education department.

74
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:53,948
Part of the assignment of the special education subcommittee is a dialogue with CPAC.

75
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:57,531
An agenda set entirely by the school committee is no longer a dialogue.

76
00:11:58,111 --> 00:12:05,477
We are concerned regarding the proposed language that, quote, the subcommittee may only need to carry out business referred to it by a majority vote of the committee.

77
00:12:05,937 --> 00:12:10,260
Subcommittees will not need to conduct business brought to the subcommittee by other means or process.

78
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:11,506
end quote.

79
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:16,952
By the advising nature of CPAC, our mandated role is to bring business to the attention of the school committee.

80
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:23,480
We are concerned of a circular situation in which the subcommittee cannot meet because there is no agenda and we have no agenda because we cannot meet.

81
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:34,369
In addition, we are concerned by the proposed language that, quote, a subcommittee will be dissolved by the committee upon completion of its assignment, or it may be dissolved by a vote of the subcommittee at any time, end quote.

82
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:40,971
The language suggests that a subcommittee can be dissolved for any reason, even if the subcommittee's assignment might be ongoing and still relevant.

83
00:12:41,771 --> 00:12:44,932
So many of you were not part of the history of the special education subcommittee.

84
00:12:45,612 --> 00:12:50,813
CPAC is asking the members of the school committee to reemphasize and remove the commitment of collaborating with CPAC

85
00:12:51,393 --> 00:12:53,895
for the benefit of the students and families we are representing.

86
00:12:54,515 --> 00:13:02,501
We hope everyone here agrees with us on the amount of progress that has been made in the district regarding disability-related policies since we started this closer collaboration.

87
00:13:02,522 --> 00:13:09,006
The impact of this collaboration was recognized and commended by DESE in their most recent special education review.

88
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:24,510
We're asking that you maintain the role of the special education subcommittee, which is that of a continuous dialogue and collaboration between CPAC and the school committee, not only to fulfill the requirements of the law, but also Medford's recent commitment to family engagement and family school partnership.

89
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:28,831
Thank you, Tanya Sullivan, co-chair, Alex Lorick, co-chair.

90
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:33,271
Thank you, member McLaughlin.

91
00:13:34,512 --> 00:13:36,132
There's member Rousseau.

92
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:37,397
Thank you.

93
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,662
I'm a member of the Special Education Subcommittee.

94
00:13:40,682 --> 00:13:42,484
Well, I was in the last term.

95
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:50,113
And I guess my question is, what policies have we actually

96
00:13:51,553 --> 00:14:00,097
I don't recall any policy discussion or dialogue or passing a single policy in the two years that that subcommittee has met.

97
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:13,602
So I absolutely think that we need to have a whole lot of policy modification, but we're sitting here as a committee unaware that we have a partial sentence in our existing policy.

98
00:14:13,882 --> 00:14:16,726
that we have a policy that says stuff that none of us even knew about.

99
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:24,637
So, I mean, I think it's our job as school committee members to, it's our number one job is to write policy.

100
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:30,124
And if we're not writing policy and just talking about policy, we're not, we're just talking.

101
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:31,815
Anybody can talk.

102
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:36,578
We were elected to write, edit, change, delete policy.

103
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:42,443
And I don't recall any policy coming out of that subcommittee, even though I wish there was.

104
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:46,186
So I just think it's important to clarify that.

105
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:53,811
I don't think that that letter around, that point in that letter about policy was just not accurate.

106
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:54,712
Thank you.

107
00:14:57,154 --> 00:14:58,515
Member Kretz and Member McLaughlin.

108
00:15:00,581 --> 00:15:17,598
Um, yes, I wanted to talk about what, what, the way that I read it was, um, I, it seems like some of the subcommittees don't actually fit with the way the resolution's written because, you know, not every subcommittee is making policies.

109
00:15:17,638 --> 00:15:23,644
Like for example, the building and ground subcommittee meetings, we weren't meeting to set policy.

110
00:15:24,264 --> 00:15:36,170
We were meeting to talk about updates, like for the Mebita High School sign, hear information from the vocational principal about the great things students are doing, things like that.

111
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:43,313
We were getting updates on the status of where things were with the generator or the boiler.

112
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:45,014
We weren't making policy.

113
00:15:45,675 --> 00:15:50,417
And the same would be for the personnel subcommittee that I've been on.

114
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:52,278
I mean, I think that,

115
00:15:53,134 --> 00:16:07,966
there's been a resolution on the agenda, you know, to have some descriptions of, you know, occupations, which, you know, could be some sort of a policy, but that's not everything that takes place in the personnel subcommittee.

116
00:16:08,867 --> 00:16:13,731
We've met to interview for new hires, things like that.

117
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:15,172
So, you know,

118
00:16:16,046 --> 00:16:28,870
I think, you know, I can understand what the CPAC board is stating in their email because, you know, not every subcommittee is setting policies all the time.

119
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:36,133
Yes, sometimes we will set a policy in the subcommittee, you know, occasionally for some, but not for all.

120
00:16:36,613 --> 00:16:38,554
It's not all about policymaking.

121
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:44,216
Thank you, member Kratz.

122
00:16:45,956 --> 00:16:47,597
Thank you, Mayor.

123
00:16:48,157 --> 00:16:53,000
I think, you know, part of the discussion, too, is, you know, I guess, you know, what is policy?

124
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,001
And to me, policy is organic.

125
00:16:56,181 --> 00:17:03,585
I have a master's degree in education policy and management from the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and one of the things that I learned there was that policy was participatory.

126
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,231
So we get feedback from our community on how we set policy.

127
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,893
That is what the subcommittees are intended for, in my opinion.

128
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:15,594
And there are some things that have been brought to the school committee that were recommendations for policy.

129
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:17,835
Some of them were adopted, some of them weren't.

130
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:25,218
Specifically, one of the things that we had asked for for several years as policy was that there be a subcommittee created for special education.

131
00:17:25,338 --> 00:17:29,760
And for three years, the CPAC, of which I was the former co-chair, so full disclosure,

132
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,165
had asked for a subcommittee and that was being said as policy and that wasn't.

133
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:44,337
So this is part of the discussion is that, you know, we also have what was created through our discussions and that did not need to go to policy because it was, they were,

134
00:17:45,738 --> 00:18:08,490
curriculum matters or other matters was a disability-related curriculum was created as a result of the special education subcommittee working with community members and the director of pupil services and Susanna Campbell to create a pilot program for a disability-related curriculum much needed in our district and also something that we had recommended previously as a CPAC to the school committee.

135
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:16,596
which was not adopted, but specifically they don't have the purview over curriculum anyway, so this was able to go that way.

136
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:26,245
We've also, the special education subcommittee also helped create professional development, again, working with community members and

137
00:18:27,346 --> 00:18:27,786
the school.

138
00:18:27,846 --> 00:18:28,887
And that's the whole point of this.

139
00:18:28,947 --> 00:18:45,539
It's back to family and community engagement and bringing community members together with school personnel, with school committee members to have an organic discussion around what policy should actually be and what should be recommended to the school committee, as opposed to just making our own policy and passing it here among the seven members.

140
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:46,099
Thank you.

141
00:18:51,368 --> 00:18:51,728
Thank you.

142
00:18:52,068 --> 00:19:03,095
I think that practice is certainly organic, and the policy should be black and white, printed, well, in our manual, and enforceable.

143
00:19:04,236 --> 00:19:10,900
If it's organic, then how can we hold the superintendent accountable to enforcing our policies that we pass?

144
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,362
She needs to know in black and white what we said is our policy.

145
00:19:15,763 --> 00:19:17,544
And if we don't, then it's up to her

146
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,822
and we can't come back and say, you didn't enforce the policy.

147
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:26,725
I mean, we had a conversation here last year about the out-of-school suspension.

148
00:19:27,165 --> 00:19:34,110
And I had made a comment that was rebuffed by the assistant superintendent and probably the superintendent, I can't remember the details.

149
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:43,436
And they were right, where I said, well, I'm sure if things are really bad, like somebody commits a murder, our policy doesn't have to take that into account.

150
00:19:43,456 --> 00:19:45,677
The superintendent will just do what she should do.

151
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:56,891
And the point that they made was, that was made was that we should not be passing policy that intends for it to be violated in certain circumstances.

152
00:19:57,851 --> 00:20:08,155
That's just not, that's like a, you know, this isn't law, but you know, it'd be like passing a law that expects people to just break the law when it's appropriate or inconvenient.

153
00:20:08,735 --> 00:20:14,057
So I don't disagree that practice is certainly organic and practice should,

154
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:22,948
When practice is changing, policy should be changed, but what policy is absolutely, in my mind, 100% not organic.

155
00:20:23,428 --> 00:20:28,272
Policy can certainly be written to be vague, where it can't be too detailed.

156
00:20:28,812 --> 00:20:34,256
Sometimes there's just no way to be as explicit as we perhaps would like.

157
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:40,922
An example is the out-of-school suspension policy, where we left that except where

158
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:46,333
The law requires, for instance, a suspension or expulsion or whatever we said.

159
00:20:47,733 --> 00:20:50,155
So, you know, we didn't go into the gory details.

160
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:55,778
We sort of left a vague sentence that covered our bases.

161
00:20:56,298 --> 00:21:02,382
But I think that policy is absolutely not organic.

162
00:21:02,742 --> 00:21:04,383
It's on paper, and that's our job.

163
00:21:04,443 --> 00:21:10,106
It's our number one job, is to, if practice is not matching policy, and we like practice,

164
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:19,189
It is our responsibility as a legislative body to write a motion, to change the policy, to match what we want it to.

165
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:25,411
It is not to say, well, that's not what really happens, and just move along.

166
00:21:25,431 --> 00:21:29,973
I mean, that's why we have probably hundreds of policies that are out of date.

167
00:21:31,634 --> 00:21:31,994
Mayor?

168
00:21:32,354 --> 00:21:35,195
Yeah, and if I may, and I'll give you the floor back,

169
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:53,478
just so I would understand it then, if we approved this change to the policy, I know member McLaughlin in her behavioral health committee, special education, they discussed like a buddy program and round table that.

170
00:21:54,758 --> 00:22:04,224
So would this deter that committee to be able to discuss, you know, great ideas, but not necessarily set policy?

171
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:18,707
Well, it would be a member could put a motion to send to the subcommittee a recommendation on whether to implement or how to implement.

172
00:22:19,608 --> 00:22:30,592
Implementation is definitely not our responsibility as a school committee, but whether or not to write a policy requiring that the buddy program exists in all of the schools and at what levels.

173
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:42,461
you know, all that work around the buddy program in the subcommittee that didn't come to this committee, there was an implied expectation that the full committee already agreed.

174
00:22:42,942 --> 00:22:45,624
You know, the new sign at the high school, I think is gorgeous.

175
00:22:45,804 --> 00:22:48,706
I saw it again the other day when I was signing the bills.

176
00:22:48,886 --> 00:22:49,527
It's beautiful.

177
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:54,450
I don't know that this full committee said to the subcommittee, hey, go do a sign.

178
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:56,392
I think it started in the subcommittee.

179
00:22:56,772 --> 00:23:00,154
So all that work was done, all that like excitement,

180
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,983
happened, it came to the full committee, and we were all essentially screwed.

181
00:23:08,223 --> 00:23:15,606
If we decided we didn't want to have the sign, we would have all looked like jerks because all the work had been done.

182
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:21,489
The work should not get done if this committee does not, by a four vote majority, agree it should get done.

183
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:24,510
That's like baseline.

184
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,372
So doing work as members, we should all be doing work as members, and we do.

185
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:31,887
But that's not committee work.

186
00:23:31,987 --> 00:23:38,753
That's not with the authority of the school system or with the spending of resources, the school system.

187
00:23:39,174 --> 00:23:40,635
Maurice comes to those meetings.

188
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:45,219
Joan, sorry, Superintendent Edward Vincent comes to those meetings.

189
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,442
Director of People's Services comes to those meetings.

190
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,185
These are people who are all getting paid to be there.

191
00:23:52,406 --> 00:23:55,268
And none of us as a full committee asked them to do that.

192
00:23:55,969 --> 00:23:56,850
And to me, that's just,

193
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:01,464
It's not that the work isn't good or that the work shouldn't continue.

194
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:08,848
It's that we should be voting for work to happen before we spend money on the behalf of the taxpayers.

195
00:24:09,628 --> 00:24:13,350
None of us have that authority as individuals or as subcommittee chairs.

196
00:24:15,091 --> 00:24:15,691
Thank you.

197
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:26,185
I want to clarify for the record that when I was saying policy is organic, what I'm saying is the process of setting policy is organic.

198
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:32,393
It requires community engagement and staff engagement

199
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:39,006
and administrative staff engagement, and that's part of the process in making policy.

200
00:24:39,426 --> 00:24:45,472
We do roundtable these things to see if policy needs to be set or not set or come before the subcommittee or not.

201
00:24:45,993 --> 00:24:48,716
Our specific goals for subcommittee, our requirements are

202
00:24:49,296 --> 00:24:52,600
to approve a budget, evaluate the superintendent, and set policy.

203
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:56,944
So some of the things that are under the setting policy are also ambiguous.

204
00:24:57,004 --> 00:25:04,492
So I also feel like when we talk about things being in black and white or this is the way it should be or shouldn't be, those are subjective conversations.

205
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:05,393
Law is subjective.

206
00:25:05,413 --> 00:25:06,935
It depends on what your priorities are.

207
00:25:07,355 --> 00:25:08,996
in terms of subcommittee meetings.

208
00:25:09,056 --> 00:25:26,887
And for me, my priority is building community relationships and building relationships with students with disabilities and staff members that are special education staff members and others, non-special education, behavioral health, mental health, sitting together, being able to discuss what is the issues, what are the issues that need to drive policy?

209
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:28,548
Because how do we know the issues otherwise?

210
00:25:28,648 --> 00:25:30,529
Just by getting phone calls from constituents?

211
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,190
I mean, that doesn't make sense to me.

212
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,471
So I don't understand that.

213
00:25:34,211 --> 00:25:45,299
And saying a member can put together a motion to ask if we can have a conversation about a specific subject that may or may not lead to policy, that doesn't make any sense to me.

214
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,061
And regarding the buddy system, I mean, the buddy,

215
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:57,588
the Best Buddies program, that's only would become before the school committee if there was a cost, a directive cost involved.

216
00:25:57,648 --> 00:26:09,057
If there was something else that did not require a cost, if there was a donation, except if it was a donation over a certain amount, obviously it would need to be, but it doesn't necessarily have to be approved by the school committee as a policy issue.

217
00:26:09,297 --> 00:26:18,505
Maybe it does, maybe elements of it do, but how do we know that unless we're talking with the Best Buddies constituents, the special education teams that may or may not want Best Buddies in their school,

218
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:23,646
the ETLs at the school, the families of persons with disabilities.

219
00:26:24,066 --> 00:26:29,667
And when we say, oh, we don't know about what happens in subcommittees, we have subcommittee minutes that we approve.

220
00:26:30,248 --> 00:26:35,769
Every single time a subcommittee meets that we go through the minutes, read them and see what's on them.

221
00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:39,610
And whether we agree with them or not, we have an opportunity at the next meeting to say that.

222
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:49,012
So I just feel like this is more of an organic process and not one that should be dictated by black and white because relationships and relationship building is not dictated by black and white.

223
00:26:49,612 --> 00:26:50,072
Thank you.

224
00:26:53,574 --> 00:26:54,074
Member Kretz.

225
00:26:56,455 --> 00:27:02,698
So I just have a question and you know, you know, I understand like, you know, what you want us to do.

226
00:27:02,778 --> 00:27:03,619
Like, I understand that.

227
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:06,380
Um, so like, let's use my example.

228
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:06,860
Okay.

229
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:17,385
I am the, um, building and grounds chairperson and, um, we're in this new policy just, you know, for the future, we were in this new policy and, you know,

230
00:27:18,015 --> 00:27:23,579
I got some emails from some members and, you know, we've been hearing for years that there should be a sign in Everett high school.

231
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,580
All right.

232
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:32,646
So, um, it's not a policy, but I could, and this is just, this is what, is this what I could do?

233
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:39,791
Like I could then write a resolution that says I'm making a resolution that, um, I,

234
00:27:40,435 --> 00:28:02,008
schedule a building and ground subcommittee meeting so that we can discuss options for a sign from Everett High School and then it would go, I would do the add the agenda button or link and I would send it off and then it would go on the agenda at one meeting and then here we would make the full vote if the body wanted to.

235
00:28:02,532 --> 00:28:04,453
have that meeting, they would take that vote.

236
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:06,074
If they didn't, it wouldn't pass.

237
00:28:07,575 --> 00:28:16,799
So, and I guess like going forward in the future, you know, some of these subcommittees are non, they're not always making policy, you know?

238
00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:19,060
So, I mean, I can understand Ms.

239
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,181
McLaughlin's points.

240
00:28:21,321 --> 00:28:24,483
So I was thinking something, you know, over the past couple of weeks.

241
00:28:24,523 --> 00:28:28,265
I don't know if it would help in any way, but I think it might if there was,

242
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,702
A lot of things I've been looking at have exceptions.

243
00:28:31,982 --> 00:28:44,093
There can be exceptions to the rule, and maybe there could be an exception that, and I don't have the exact, perfect wording, but in some subcommittees,

244
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:51,012
they can have regular scheduled meetings per year, XX.

245
00:28:52,053 --> 00:29:00,656
Let's say I don't have the perfect number or anything either, but I know in my meetings, I've only had two or three the most.

246
00:29:01,076 --> 00:29:08,459
So like for some subcommittees, they should plan to meet four times per year or more.

247
00:29:09,468 --> 00:29:20,213
three times per year, you know, and it doesn't necessarily have to list the subcommittees because that can be part of the functions and duties once those are determined, but we're not there yet.

248
00:29:20,873 --> 00:29:37,880
So, so that was just something I was thinking about that, you know, we're, the rule is so specific for the policy making subcommittees, but it's just, you know, it's, it has to be a little bit broader to, you know, to go into more depth for the other subcommittees, cause it doesn't really work for all of them.

249
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:38,861
That's what I think.

250
00:29:39,141 --> 00:29:44,485
You know, and I did, you know, reach out and talk to Ms.

251
00:29:44,505 --> 00:29:54,093
Van de Kloot and she did explain to me that this is how the policy was, you know, before I came on board as a school committee member.

252
00:29:54,553 --> 00:29:58,396
And then things kind of shifted away and we started doing things.

253
00:29:59,087 --> 00:30:01,527
the other way, which is the way we've been doing them.

254
00:30:01,888 --> 00:30:04,848
So she did explain it to me that this is how it was.

255
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:12,750
And so, and I guess now I'm trying to figure out if this is how it was, and I never knew what it was like, you know, what do I do?

256
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,150
And then I was talking to Ms.

257
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:21,031
McLaughlin at one point, and it seemed like our subcommittees had just like defunct because we never had them.

258
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:26,132
And then it just kind of set into me, I was a new subcommittee member, a new school committee member,

259
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:29,855
And I didn't know that I was supposed to refer things to subcommittee.

260
00:30:29,875 --> 00:30:32,357
So I just, we didn't have them, honestly.

261
00:30:32,877 --> 00:30:41,525
And then we did every once in a while Mia would get a lot of emails and then we would get in touch with the mayor and then the mayor would then put it on the agenda.

262
00:30:42,165 --> 00:30:43,566
And then we would have the subcommittee.

263
00:30:43,586 --> 00:30:47,049
So then I thought it through and I'm like, oh my God, that's what we did do.

264
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,551
But I didn't know because it was never written down.

265
00:30:49,772 --> 00:30:53,375
Like you said, we never had anything written down, none of us.

266
00:30:54,035 --> 00:31:19,058
you know so now we're we're trying to put something together um and i think we do need something but at the same time it's not going to work for every solid you know every subcommittee you know there can be exceptions um maybe i can just i i think it can work because number three it doesn't say policy on here it says um carry out business so for you it would be

267
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:33,416
be resolved that we explore a new sign at the McGlynn Elementary School, and then this committee would vote, yes, let's send it to the subcommittee on building and grounds, and that's where it would be discussed, you'd get quotes.

268
00:31:35,177 --> 00:31:37,878
So it would work, because it doesn't specifically say policy.

269
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,131
So I think that that helps a little bit.

270
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:44,731
And I think you had it exactly right.

271
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:49,754
When you started to speak, you would just put it on the, as a resolution, you'd get four members to support it.

272
00:31:49,774 --> 00:31:52,315
It would go to your committee and then come back for a final vote.

273
00:31:54,316 --> 00:31:56,718
Member Graham, then member McLaughlin.

274
00:31:57,718 --> 00:31:57,938
Yeah.

275
00:31:58,018 --> 00:32:01,340
And through the chair to member Kratz, I think that's exactly how it would work.

276
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,961
And I think the benefit of

277
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:17,371
doing it this way is that in the example of this sign, I think we're going to talk tonight about the fact that we're at a real crossroads with the Medford High building.

278
00:32:18,131 --> 00:32:21,594
And I mean, honestly, the community has been talking about that for many, many years.

279
00:32:22,275 --> 00:32:29,880
And I do think without a plan, there's always this question of, is it worth spending this money right now?

280
00:32:30,001 --> 00:32:41,329
And I think on the one hand, I generally feel like it is worth spending the money right now to do the things that make the students there right now have a better educational experience.

281
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:46,472
And maybe that's a sign, but we also don't have an endless supply of money and

282
00:32:48,178 --> 00:32:51,701
we don't get to make decisions about all the things that we think that they should have.

283
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:52,802
Sometimes there are choices.

284
00:32:53,583 --> 00:33:15,402
And if that came before this committee, we could have had a dialogue about it and provided some instruction or some like guidance to the subcommittee so that then the discussion could be productive and not sort of have the potential to like increase the level of expectation about what we're going to accomplish with this sign.

285
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:22,854
only to have it come back here and for people to say, Oh no, that's too, like, that's way more than I think we should spend on a sign.

286
00:33:23,415 --> 00:33:39,689
So I think the benefit of that is like this community, this committee gets to have some dialogue before we send you off to spend your time and your energy and John McLaughlin off to spend his time, his energy and the superintendent and all the people who go to the meetings and like

287
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:46,954
setting expectations or implying to the community that we're going to do something if we actually never intended to do that thing.

288
00:33:47,094 --> 00:33:48,337
So I do think

289
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:52,210
Having that collaboration discussion here is really important.

290
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:58,373
And I would say to the CPAC, I always want to hear what the CPAC has to say.

291
00:33:58,393 --> 00:34:02,335
I enjoy when they come and present annually to this committee.

292
00:34:02,355 --> 00:34:11,800
And I think it would be perfectly reasonable for a committee like that to have a meeting on an annual basis to talk about

293
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,101
what the CPAC's goals are.

294
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:22,384
I think it should tie to the significant presentation and all the effort they put in here, but the timing of that is certainly up to the chair of that committee.

295
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:33,529
But I do wanna hear from the CPAC before we go off and spin up something in subcommittee that maybe doesn't have the support here.

296
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:40,211
So I think A, this committee really does wanna hear from folks like the CPAC and the DELAC and all the other community groups, and B,

297
00:34:42,312 --> 00:34:46,134
you know, I want to see us understand that we have the option.

298
00:34:46,154 --> 00:34:56,859
We would always have the option to put a resolution on to say, please go meet with the CPAC and ask them what their goals are for the year and what they want to see or what their problems of, you know, what are the problems that they think are most pressing?

299
00:34:56,899 --> 00:34:59,741
I think that's perfect work for subcommittee.

300
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:03,483
I just don't think it should happen without this committee having eyes on it first.

301
00:35:06,544 --> 00:35:06,844
Thank you.

302
00:35:06,864 --> 00:35:07,505
Member Graham.

303
00:35:07,525 --> 00:35:08,125
Member McLaughlin.

304
00:35:08,717 --> 00:35:09,457
Thank you, Mayor.

305
00:35:10,038 --> 00:35:12,859
I would agree that there needs to be guidance on the subcommittees.

306
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,602
When this was first proposed to the school committee, that's accurate.

307
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:26,746
We were told initially that there would not be a subcommittee of special education because there were already so many subcommittees and many of them were defunct.

308
00:35:27,307 --> 00:35:29,168
And so there was no structure around that.

309
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:36,572
That was the whole point, that there needed to be a special education subcommittee because there was no structure around the committees that existed in the

310
00:35:38,089 --> 00:35:39,730
in the school committee prior to that.

311
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:49,493
And, you know, I'm looking back to the letter that the co-chairs wrote and the quote that they said, a dialogue set by the school committee is no longer a dialogue.

312
00:35:49,513 --> 00:36:06,300
And I think that's the point is that CPAC came to school committee because they wanted to have an ongoing dialogue with some members of the school committee to be able to move things forward, to have the director of pupil services participate in that process, to have family members participate in that process, to have students with disabilities

313
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,443
participate in that process so they could see the process of setting policy and come to the school committee at the end of the year and bring policy forward.

314
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:21,566
Perhaps the school committee, the CPAC meeting needs to happen at the beginning of the year and they can discuss what some of their

315
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,801
interest and goals and what have you are, but then that's not a conversation.

316
00:36:26,221 --> 00:36:33,104
That's them coming forward, you know, at a podium, standing in front of folks to tell them, you know, to again, ask to be included.

317
00:36:33,144 --> 00:36:34,745
And I don't feel like this is inclusive.

318
00:36:35,545 --> 00:36:39,347
I feel like we really need to think about we later on tonight, we're having a meeting on

319
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:43,549
like 18 pages of rules that are being proposed, this is among them.

320
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:55,797
And I think we really need to think about how are we actually involving our community members in this process and what that is and, you know, looking at what the rules were previously, looking at what the proposed rules are, not by, you know, by

321
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,503
you know, motions being moved forward, but by a collaborative process.

322
00:37:02,324 --> 00:37:13,973
So again, I mean, obviously, I would also say if people are interested in the CPAC and what their views and positions are, then, you know, they meet monthly and have all sorts of presentations.

323
00:37:14,154 --> 00:37:18,157
And, you know, part of the problem was that school committee members didn't come to those meetings.

324
00:37:18,297 --> 00:37:19,018
A few have.

325
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:22,001
over the, in the years, but a lot of times they don't.

326
00:37:22,521 --> 00:37:29,830
And I think that's important if people really want to build relationships and build dialogue, but that hasn't happened, which is another reason that the subcommittee was created.

327
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:36,838
So again, if I don't have the votes, I don't have the votes, but I want to go on the record as saying that I think that this is not inclusive and I do not think

328
00:37:37,378 --> 00:37:40,441
that this is engaging families at all.

329
00:37:40,461 --> 00:37:41,902
I think it's actually the opposite.

330
00:37:41,962 --> 00:37:52,472
And I think that, you know, as the CPAC letter stated, that the Department of Education and DESE actually lauded our district this year in their

331
00:37:54,333 --> 00:38:00,797
memo out to the community on what a great relationship building experience has happened with CPEX.

332
00:38:00,817 --> 00:38:06,821
Cause that's not often the case in many districts because special education and special education needs and issues are complicated.

333
00:38:07,302 --> 00:38:14,326
And there can be a lot of sort of issues with families and districts and, you know, building relationships is really how we move things forward.

334
00:38:14,366 --> 00:38:16,487
And so I don't think Desi was wrong in putting that forward.

335
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:17,528
I think it was a good point.

336
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:19,509
I'm concerned that this will,

337
00:38:21,527 --> 00:38:22,627
affect that relationship.

338
00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:23,948
And I don't want that to happen.

339
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:30,209
Yes.

340
00:38:30,649 --> 00:38:47,594
So, um, I know I mentioned, you know, adding an exception, you know, to this, um, resolution, you know, that some subcommittees, you know, as needed may have, you know, three

341
00:38:48,750 --> 00:39:06,082
you know, scheduled subcommittee meetings, which would be like at the beginning of the year, the middle of the year and the end of the year, so that, you know, we could hear some feedback from, you know, like, for example, the CPAC meeting, which is, you know, I think that for that subcommittee, you know, it seems like

342
00:39:07,748 --> 00:39:23,120
You know, I remember when Erin had taken on that responsibility and she took it upon herself and she held those meetings and invited everybody to those meetings and it was very productive and the results were shared and it was a good working relationship.

343
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:32,088
I mean, if three is too much, you could start with two and then add, like, that's why I was thinking of adding it as an exception.

344
00:39:32,588 --> 00:39:34,529
You know, I'm saying for my committee,

345
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,694
I don't think I'm going to have a problem with my committees adding it as a resolution.

346
00:39:40,114 --> 00:39:42,577
But, you know, when I think about Ms.

347
00:39:42,617 --> 00:39:49,223
McLaughlin's committee, you know, you know, that that seems a little bit difficult because

348
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:58,062
you know, we have been having them regularly scheduled just the past year, like, you know, on a regularly scheduled calendar event.

349
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:00,644
So it just seems very abrupt.

350
00:40:00,705 --> 00:40:02,286
We're going to, you know, discontinue that.

351
00:40:02,527 --> 00:40:07,812
And I understand that, you know, it's involving a lot of personnel and their time.

352
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:08,993
And I understand that, you know,

353
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:14,802
that the time is associated with the monetary value, you know, because they're spending the time at those meetings.

354
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:24,837
But, you know, if they're informational and we're sharing information and, you know, we're receiving information from the public, I think it's beneficial to continue with the meetings, you know, if,

355
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:32,203
it was agreeable with all the individuals involved on the specific number of meetings per year.

356
00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:35,485
And that's why I say like to start, have two.

357
00:40:36,146 --> 00:40:42,591
I mean, I'm just thinking and I'm getting ahead of myself, but like reading the policies that were set forth by Mr. Russo.

358
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:49,736
In his policy, one of the mentions having two annual meetings with,

359
00:40:50,717 --> 00:40:52,598
with, um, city council.

360
00:40:52,798 --> 00:40:53,038
Okay.

361
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:56,699
So, so that's specific in his rules and functions.

362
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:09,663
Why can't we have something specific in the rules and functions specifically pertaining to the CPAC, you know, um, and, and their disability, you know, committee, the behavioral health special education.

363
00:41:10,473 --> 00:41:21,277
You know, I mean, I know that I'm kind of getting ahead of myself because, you know, we are at the beginning stages of writing documents and, you know, it's the first time we're doing this.

364
00:41:21,357 --> 00:41:22,237
We've never done this.

365
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:27,579
So we want to do it and we want to do it right, you know, to make it fit for everybody.

366
00:41:27,999 --> 00:41:30,420
And some of them is just not going to fit for everybody.

367
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:36,762
And I think as needed, that's why if we put an exception and we don't list them, because there might be an exception and,

368
00:41:37,757 --> 00:41:45,262
you know, maybe those subcommittees just, you know, it's better for them to have the regular meetings, but not necessarily every month.

369
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:48,444
That's just an idea.

370
00:41:49,685 --> 00:41:50,025
Mayor.

371
00:41:52,607 --> 00:41:54,348
Member McLaughlin.

372
00:41:55,049 --> 00:41:56,270
Thank you, through the chair.

373
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,250
Thank you, Member Kretz.

374
00:41:57,290 --> 00:42:00,632
I appreciate the willingness to negotiate.

375
00:42:00,672 --> 00:42:01,833
I think that's always a good,

376
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:10,876
a good characteristic and a colleague and a school committee member and other politicians.

377
00:42:11,136 --> 00:42:15,660
And I think negotiation is a really important part of the process.

378
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:22,686
And I think, you know, I question whether all or nothing is in fact, again, a collaborative process.

379
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:29,251
So I'm certainly open to some discussion around negotiation on the topic, but I also did want to mention that

380
00:42:30,352 --> 00:42:35,713
In addition to the CPAC relationship with the school committee and the special education department,

381
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,788
and it being recognized by DESE.

382
00:42:38,488 --> 00:42:46,392
We also had people from other towns coming to meetings and commenting about the work that was happening in the district regarding special education.

383
00:42:47,152 --> 00:42:52,094
Most recently at the last CPAC meeting, which was recorded, that was on disability awareness.

384
00:42:52,754 --> 00:43:00,038
And several other towns are asking the Medford CPAC to come to their town and talk about how we work with the district and how we collaborate with the district.

385
00:43:01,138 --> 00:43:05,400
And again, I feel like we should aim to move forward and take pride in our work and look to create an environment

386
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:07,456
when relationships can thrive.

387
00:43:07,536 --> 00:43:12,497
So I appreciate the attempt at a middle ground in negotiation.

388
00:43:12,537 --> 00:43:12,937
Thank you.

389
00:43:15,058 --> 00:43:20,320
So is there an amendment to try to reach a middle ground so we could set the policy?

390
00:43:24,181 --> 00:43:31,704
Yes, I would like to make an amendment that we have an exception to the rule that allows for

391
00:43:33,548 --> 00:43:36,846
subcommittees as needed to have scheduled

392
00:43:39,065 --> 00:43:47,729
you know, let's just say for the purpose of the document to have two or three scheduled subcommittee meetings per year.

393
00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:55,352
And honestly, I don't think some of the committee members are going to do that, but I do think that some of the committees are going to need it.

394
00:43:55,372 --> 00:43:59,954
Like I can see right off the top, the personnel, we don't need something like that for the personnel.

395
00:43:59,974 --> 00:44:01,754
We, we hardly meet about that.

396
00:44:01,794 --> 00:44:06,976
So it just, it makes sense for some, I mean, the rules, it's always going to have policies.

397
00:44:07,016 --> 00:44:08,217
That's a policy making,

398
00:44:08,598 --> 00:44:09,119
subcommittee.

399
00:44:10,692 --> 00:44:20,497
you know, the engagement communication that had some policy in it, but then it also had discussion and it had topics about afterschool pay and things like that.

400
00:44:20,637 --> 00:44:38,926
So in the curriculum, that would be policy, you know, so like most of them are going to be, you know, it's going to be easy to follow the resolution to add them on the agenda, but then for the committees that don't, I think it's, you know, fair to,

401
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:41,347
Let me look at the new subcommittees.

402
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,369
Sorry, I was looking at last year's.

403
00:44:44,509 --> 00:44:57,679
Some of the newer ones, diversity and equity, I think for those to start with in the strategic planning, I think to start with, they would have to maybe have at least one or two meetings per year.

404
00:44:58,559 --> 00:44:59,840
They're newer committees.

405
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:10,620
So like one or two meetings per year, up to one or two meetings per year to do like listening and listening sessions, discussion, idea building.

406
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:17,588
And then it would just be an extra step because then you'd have to take your ideas to the floor to then go back to committee and set policy.

407
00:45:19,204 --> 00:45:24,527
potentially if the discussion, you know, creates ideas for policy and that that's what's needed.

408
00:45:24,627 --> 00:45:24,948
Yeah.

409
00:45:25,108 --> 00:45:27,069
I mean, some of the things don't fall under our purview.

410
00:45:27,169 --> 00:45:36,455
So I know that- So if you have like an hour where you're discussing how can your committees discussing like some sort of a, like a

411
00:45:36,808 --> 00:45:47,920
buddy system and to be more inclusive, you brainstorm ideas, come up with the idea, bring it back to the committee on a Monday night and say, this is our idea.

412
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,541
How does the committee feel about it?

413
00:45:50,042 --> 00:45:50,522
We love it.

414
00:45:50,783 --> 00:45:54,887
Go back to committee, set policy on that one idea, and then come back for a final vote.

415
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:55,907
Well, I don't know.

416
00:45:55,987 --> 00:45:57,868
I mean, that's the whole point we're talking about.

417
00:45:57,908 --> 00:45:59,888
It's about bringing what we need to set policy.

418
00:46:00,248 --> 00:46:03,769
You know, what we would bring to the school committee is asking requests for setting policy.

419
00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:09,431
So what I hear you saying now is that we have the discussion and then we have to come back to the school committee and say, was our discussion okay?

420
00:46:09,471 --> 00:46:11,271
Can we further that discussion regarding policy?

421
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:12,111
And again, I don't know.

422
00:46:12,131 --> 00:46:18,033
I know the director of people's services is here and I guess I would love to know what their position is because I know that

423
00:46:18,873 --> 00:46:32,405
They had been meeting for a month at a time, specifically the subcommittee, specifically because they had been building traction around some issues, particularly disability awareness that had been a five-year project that was finally getting some traction.

424
00:46:32,585 --> 00:46:41,172
And I wouldn't disagree that a monthly schedule can be a little bit taxing on folks, especially like last year when every subcommittee suddenly had a monthly schedule for

425
00:46:42,173 --> 00:46:43,393
reasons that are so unclear to me.

426
00:46:44,394 --> 00:47:07,400
And so there were, you know, three, four or five meetings a week in addition to our own meetings, which was really tricky, but, you know, through the chair and the superintendent, if the director of people's services would be willing to share what the experience has been with the subcommittee and whether that's been beneficial to the district or whether it's too time consuming or what have you, I know that we'd love to hear from administration as well.

427
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,060
Thank you.

428
00:47:13,454 --> 00:47:19,536
So I truly value our partnership with the CPAC.

429
00:47:19,596 --> 00:47:37,822
I wanna open and say that I do believe we have an outstanding relationship with CPAC and the Medford Public Schools is definitely committed to trying to meet the needs of all of our students, those students with disabilities and those that may be having any behavioral health challenges.

430
00:47:38,462 --> 00:47:39,563
I would just say,

431
00:47:41,807 --> 00:47:52,269
in terms of all of the subcommittees, when we were looking at the totality of the amount of meetings that we were having, that it really was taxing.

432
00:47:52,329 --> 00:47:57,891
I mean, everyone has a certain bandwidth and capacity for the work.

433
00:47:58,391 --> 00:48:08,193
And I do think that for some of the meetings, we had to call on the same representatives multiple times.

434
00:48:08,773 --> 00:48:10,354
So I do think that that can,

435
00:48:12,094 --> 00:48:13,235
you know, via balance.

436
00:48:14,036 --> 00:48:30,487
So, you know, as you're having this discussion about maybe how much is too much and how much is enough, I think the meetings should happen, but they should happen not necessarily on a monthly basis, depending on what it is.

437
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:47,300
And when I would think about the way we had operated, being able to give the other members of central administration almost like a format or a template in advance,

438
00:48:47,980 --> 00:49:01,985
So really in January, but to be able to say to someone, we'll be presenting in March, and to give them time to be able to say this is what the topic is going to be, if it's something that needed to be presented to the entire committee.

439
00:49:04,366 --> 00:49:08,809
I know the proposal is to move from six meetings to nine meetings.

440
00:49:09,330 --> 00:49:22,759
I can just share that that did elevate my blood pressure because I was surprised to see that we increased the number of subcommittees as opposed to potentially decreasing it.

441
00:49:23,539 --> 00:49:30,824
I have spoken with other colleagues in different districts and they seem to have three or four subcommittees.

442
00:49:31,805 --> 00:49:38,388
that kind of have a genetic title, but they will meet on an as-needed basis.

443
00:49:39,209 --> 00:49:43,531
So they're- Yes, that was actually a point of information.

444
00:49:43,551 --> 00:49:44,672
That was a follow-up I wanted to have.

445
00:49:44,712 --> 00:49:53,256
I didn't think we were getting to the names of the subcommittees yet or the description, I mean, the division of the subcommittees, but I'm also unclear on some of the divisions of the subcommittee.

446
00:49:53,276 --> 00:50:01,220
Like, I don't understand, for example, one is people services, and then we have a separate one that's special education and behavioral health, and that

447
00:50:01,684 --> 00:50:03,987
special education and behavioral health are people services.

448
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:06,370
So I didn't understand what the differentiation there was.

449
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:09,654
So I was trying to, I would love some explanation on that.

450
00:50:09,754 --> 00:50:14,641
And I agree, like if you're subdividing subcommittees, then that can be problematic.

451
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:17,124
And I couldn't agree more that there were far too many meetings last

452
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:29,293
and frankly, there were far too long meetings last year, of which I hope tonight doesn't become one, because the meetings that were last year as well were really taxing, and again, on all of us.

453
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:37,576
So I'm not sure, I mean, I feel like this is a separate issue than the proposed subcommittee assignments.

454
00:50:37,916 --> 00:50:43,298
I mean, I think we should talk about the proposed subcommittee assignments, but I'm speaking specifically to the,

455
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:47,413
what was the special education and behavioral health subcommittee?

456
00:50:47,493 --> 00:50:54,319
I don't know what people services subcommittee is because special ed and behavioral health is under people services.

457
00:50:54,339 --> 00:50:54,579
I don't know.

458
00:50:54,619 --> 00:51:05,450
So I did not, these were recommendations made by the members to the chair for suggestions for the sub committees.

459
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:07,952
So I was not involved in that process at all.

460
00:51:08,613 --> 00:51:09,834
Yeah, I would just love some,

461
00:51:10,678 --> 00:51:14,981
enlightenment around those when the chair's ready, because I don't understand.

462
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:23,205
But I get it when you're saying there's now one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine subcommittees, and you don't want meetings every month for nine subcommittees.

463
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:25,067
I know, we had those last year.

464
00:51:25,087 --> 00:51:27,208
It was crazy, it was far too much.

465
00:51:27,788 --> 00:51:32,731
And we worked really hard to make sure that we were on time with ending ours and had an agenda ahead of time and what have you.

466
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:33,732
So I couldn't agree more.

467
00:51:34,272 --> 00:51:38,474
But I think that this is obviously a conversation,

468
00:51:40,557 --> 00:51:53,942
right for conversation because, and we're not, the community might not realize this, but you know, we're not able to have these conversations obviously based on open meeting outside of the school committee with more than, you know, three individuals of the seven.

469
00:51:54,042 --> 00:51:58,344
So this hasn't been discussed previously, at least not with me.

470
00:51:58,464 --> 00:52:02,065
So I would love some elucidation.

471
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:02,465
Thank you.

472
00:52:03,146 --> 00:52:03,466
Mayor.

473
00:52:03,726 --> 00:52:03,866
Yep.

474
00:52:03,926 --> 00:52:08,167
We have seven minutes to discuss the actual agenda.

475
00:52:08,227 --> 00:52:09,628
So member Graham.

476
00:52:10,463 --> 00:52:31,991
So I think to Member Kretz's point, we should add to number three, a sentence that says subcommittees may meet at the beginning of each school year to conduct one meeting where a listening session with members of the community occurs.

477
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:36,032
And then I would make a motion to approve this as amended.

478
00:52:38,313 --> 00:52:38,613
Second.

479
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,940
Motion for approval by Member Graham as amended.

480
00:52:47,741 --> 00:52:52,505
Once by Member McLaughlin to strike the last sentence in paragraph three.

481
00:52:52,625 --> 00:53:01,632
Once by Member Graham to add an additional sentence about a listening session at the beginning of the year on up to each subcommittee.

482
00:53:02,592 --> 00:53:04,974
For approval by Member Graham, seconded by Member Rousseau.

483
00:53:05,134 --> 00:53:09,197
Clarification though, one listening session is what is being proposed.

484
00:53:09,738 --> 00:53:09,918
Yes.

485
00:53:14,252 --> 00:53:17,333
Motion for approval, if we could call the roll.

486
00:53:17,474 --> 00:53:18,054
Oh, that's me.

487
00:53:18,074 --> 00:53:18,834
I'm so sad.

488
00:53:20,815 --> 00:53:21,635
Yep, take your time.

489
00:53:23,256 --> 00:53:30,920
It's five minutes.

490
00:53:37,203 --> 00:53:42,825
Before we take the vote, could I just mention just on the amendment.

491
00:53:44,492 --> 00:53:58,878
have one meeting per year listening session and maybe and if needed, you know, to have an additional meeting if necessary, something like that.

492
00:53:59,418 --> 00:54:03,380
I, I am not in favor of that amendment to the motion that I have on the floor.

493
00:54:09,734 --> 00:54:14,255
But the beginning, I think, leaves it open-ended, so the beginning of the year could be January, February, March, April.

494
00:54:14,355 --> 00:54:18,316
I mean, because there are a number of committees, and I'm sure not all of them would have listening sessions.

495
00:54:18,336 --> 00:54:21,997
And it's not going to list the subcommittee, so it's not going to exclude any subcommittee.

496
00:54:22,157 --> 00:54:24,017
It may, if they want to.

497
00:54:24,097 --> 00:54:24,717
It may do it.

498
00:54:24,737 --> 00:54:25,157
It may or may not.

499
00:54:25,177 --> 00:54:25,277
Yeah.

500
00:54:25,337 --> 00:54:38,480
It would be a way to brainstorm ideas, to get proposals that you want to bring to the committee, to hopefully get a majority vote, to then discuss policy, go back to the committee and discuss either the business or the policy.

501
00:54:40,622 --> 00:54:41,062
Roll call.

502
00:54:43,725 --> 00:54:44,265
Member Graham.

503
00:54:44,465 --> 00:54:44,725
Yes.

504
00:54:45,986 --> 00:54:46,567
Member Haynes.

505
00:54:47,288 --> 00:54:47,548
Yes.

506
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:50,110
Yes.

507
00:54:52,132 --> 00:54:52,852
Member McLaughlin.

508
00:54:53,272 --> 00:54:53,513
No.

509
00:54:56,095 --> 00:54:56,695
Member McStone.

510
00:54:56,715 --> 00:54:56,775
Yes.

511
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,078
Member Russo.

512
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:00,438
Yes.

513
00:55:01,579 --> 00:55:02,440
Mayor Longo Kern.

514
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:02,960
Yes.

515
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:06,403
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

516
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:08,185
The policy passes.

517
00:55:10,032 --> 00:55:11,093
Is there a motion to adjourn?

518
00:55:12,094 --> 00:55:15,717
Mayor, actually, what about these proposed subcommittee assignments?

519
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:19,400
I don't see that on our agenda.

520
00:55:20,421 --> 00:55:23,464
But it's on our list of, it was included in the subcommittee, so.

521
00:55:26,434 --> 00:55:30,457
Do we have to put it on the agenda for the next session then before we can actually have?

522
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:33,919
The school committee maintains a set of standing subcommittees during each term.

523
00:55:33,939 --> 00:55:42,145
It may establish special subcommittees for a specific purpose to make recommendations for committee action or policy.

524
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:55,394
Mayor, the agenda does say that we're discussing the structure and function, so I think it's reasonable for us to talk about the structure of the assignments.

525
00:55:59,644 --> 00:56:00,385
Member McLaughlin.

526
00:56:01,686 --> 00:56:07,532
Oh, I'm just asking, I don't know the difference between the people services and the special education and behavioral health subcommittees.

527
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:13,938
Mayor.

528
00:56:14,198 --> 00:56:15,479
Member Graham.

529
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,222
It's my understanding that the way that

530
00:56:18,628 --> 00:56:23,871
that the subcommittee works today is there are actually two subcommittees really happening in one.

531
00:56:24,211 --> 00:56:27,673
One is special education and one is behavioral health.

532
00:56:27,773 --> 00:56:33,636
And they're two different topics that do sometimes bring different folks to the meetings.

533
00:56:34,556 --> 00:56:45,042
And I am gonna make an assumption that really just special education should be struck from the second one,

534
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:50,793
The first one is pupil services, which obviously includes special education, and the second is behavioral health.

535
00:56:50,913 --> 00:56:57,558
And then there are two, and then they can deal with whatever topics are appropriate for their own areas.

536
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:01,382
Thank you.

537
00:57:01,502 --> 00:57:08,787
I think we should define what pupil services are and what falls under that category because it is special education and behavioral health.

538
00:57:09,427 --> 00:57:17,913
And I really think that it's not advisable to strike special education from the subcommittee name.

539
00:57:21,916 --> 00:57:25,778
So could we just remove pupil services as a subcommittee?

540
00:57:26,158 --> 00:57:27,899
If that's a motion on the floor.

541
00:57:30,775 --> 00:57:33,776
I would make a motion to remove people services as a subcommittee.

542
00:57:33,936 --> 00:57:34,436
There we go.

543
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:36,476
Second.

544
00:57:37,056 --> 00:57:43,678
Motion to remove people services as subcommittee by member McLaughlin, seconded by member Rousseau.

545
00:57:46,938 --> 00:57:47,558
All those in favor?

546
00:57:48,139 --> 00:57:48,619
Aye.

547
00:57:48,859 --> 00:57:49,559
All those opposed?

548
00:57:49,579 --> 00:57:55,020
Okay, people services is struck from Medford School Committee proposed assignments.

549
00:57:59,582 --> 00:58:03,058
Motion to adjourn by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Stone.

550
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,163
All those in favor?
