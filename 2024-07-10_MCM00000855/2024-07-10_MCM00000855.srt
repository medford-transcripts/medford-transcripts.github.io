1
00:00:01,286 --> 00:00:01,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, everyone.

2
00:00:01,967 --> 00:00:12,191
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the May 15th, 2024 subcommittee of the Beaver Health and Special Education Subcommittee meeting for three o'clock.

3
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:15,853
[SPEAKER_09]: This meeting is being held via Zoom only.

4
00:00:15,873 --> 00:00:21,496
[SPEAKER_09]: It will be recorded and is being broadcast onto Zoom as we speak.

5
00:00:22,595 --> 00:00:24,897
[SPEAKER_09]: And I do hear that I'm not alone anymore.

6
00:00:26,218 --> 00:00:30,461
[SPEAKER_09]: The YouTube link is in the meeting notice.

7
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:50,856
[SPEAKER_09]: It is https://mps02155-org.zoom.us slash u slash A-D-D-N-A-W-M capital L-G capital Y. I think they thought that was better than the old way.

8
00:00:50,876 --> 00:00:51,737
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if I agree.

9
00:00:52,557 --> 00:01:05,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyways, if you have any questions or comments you want to send during the meeting rather than speaking up, you can send those to me directly at pruseau at medford.k12.ma.us.

10
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Please include your first and last name, your Medford Street address, your question or comment.

11
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:13,661
[SPEAKER_09]: The agenda for today, as approved by the committee on April 29, 2024, item two,

12
00:01:16,362 --> 00:01:31,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Item 2024-22, be it resolved that the Special Education Behavioral Health Subcommittee will meet to discuss whether the Curtis-Tufts School should be co-located with the Medford High School campus to improve educational outcomes for Curtis-Tufts students.

13
00:01:31,695 --> 00:01:32,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Say that three times fast.

14
00:01:33,897 --> 00:01:38,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved that the subcommittee will invite current and former students and staff to provide

15
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:57,331
[SPEAKER_09]: comments, but it also resolved that the committee will report back to the school committee on whether the credits test program should be co-located no later than June 3, 2024, because this information is critical to the progress of the Medbrook Comprehensive High School Building Committee as it completes the district's educational profile.

16
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:58,552
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a mouthful.

17
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:02,194
[SPEAKER_09]: I am going to take the roll.

18
00:02:02,274 --> 00:02:05,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Intapa is absent.

19
00:02:05,636 --> 00:02:06,277
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Olapade?

20
00:02:07,473 --> 00:02:07,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

21
00:02:08,714 --> 00:02:10,655
[SPEAKER_09]: And member Rousseau is present, two present.

22
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:11,535
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a quorum.

23
00:02:12,656 --> 00:02:14,036
[SPEAKER_09]: We have lots of people popping on.

24
00:02:14,056 --> 00:02:14,677
[SPEAKER_09]: This is lovely.

25
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,458
[SPEAKER_09]: We usually have zero people on subcommittees other than those of us that have to be here.

26
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:19,719
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's nice.

27
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,721
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I was trying to figure out how to run this meeting.

28
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:31,725
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will admit it's an unusual subcommittee meeting because there's not like some policy we're updating or, but,

29
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:47,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought maybe we could go around and introduce ourselves, those of us that are here, so that you can say why you're here, just for my notes, but also so we can have a sense of how to move the meeting along.

30
00:02:48,652 --> 00:02:53,695
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll start at the top for me, which is, of course, different for everyone, and that would be Suzanne.

31
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:57,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, good afternoon.

32
00:02:58,006 --> 00:03:01,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Suzanne Galussi, Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction.

33
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:18,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here just to be a participant in the decision-making process and very curious about the rollout of the Curtis-Tufts and possible participation with Medford High School.

34
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:20,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

35
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:24,420
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Olapade, do you want to say who you are in case everybody doesn't already know?

36
00:03:26,163 --> 00:03:26,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

37
00:03:26,383 --> 00:03:26,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.

38
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:27,724
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Aaron Olapade.

39
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:29,826
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm on the school committee with member Rousseau.

40
00:03:30,307 --> 00:03:34,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just excited to be here to discuss this idea and hopefully move things forward.

41
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:34,972
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

42
00:03:35,512 --> 00:03:36,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

43
00:03:36,854 --> 00:03:37,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Edouard-Vincent.

44
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, good afternoon, everyone.

45
00:03:40,243 --> 00:03:43,767
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Marice Edouard-Vincent, superintendent of schools.

46
00:03:44,367 --> 00:03:48,231
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to be here tonight to be part of this conversation as well.

47
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:54,036
[SPEAKER_00]: And listen to the proposals regarding the Curtis tough school.

48
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:54,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

49
00:03:55,357 --> 00:03:57,079
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Miss Bowen.

50
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Good afternoon, everyone.

51
00:03:59,057 --> 00:03:59,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Joan Bowen.

52
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:02,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Director of Student Services here at Medford Public Schools.

53
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:11,541
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here also to provide some historical background as well as informational background about the Curtis-Tufts, as well as the staff here.

54
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:17,823
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been in discussions about where we see the Curtis-Tufts in the future.

55
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:25,866
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this is a very important meeting to get feedback from the stakeholders and then make our decisions going forward.

56
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:26,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

57
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:28,418
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

58
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:48,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, my name is Peter Cushing, Assistant Superintendent of Schools for Enrichment, Innovation, and Operations, and I'm here as someone who has worked closely in the past with the Curtis-Tufts, and I'm very excited as we move through the MSBA process to see about this co-location opportunity for the benefit of students.

59
00:04:49,454 --> 00:04:53,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, and there's a little fly running around, so I'm not losing it.

60
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:54,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I just can't get it.

61
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Next up, I have Jess Hurley, Healy, excuse me.

62
00:05:02,383 --> 00:05:04,845
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't wanna introduce yourself or anything, that's perfectly fine too.

63
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:07,847
[SPEAKER_09]: And actually.

64
00:05:07,867 --> 00:05:09,588
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, sorry.

65
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:16,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just here to see the update of what we're gonna be doing with the Curtis test and just to observe.

66
00:05:17,473 --> 00:05:18,113
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Jess.

67
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:22,036
[SPEAKER_09]: And I have Lori, but I believe there's more than one person there, so.

68
00:05:24,678 --> 00:05:26,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, I'm Lori Hodgdon.

69
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:29,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the current school director here at Curtis Tufts.

70
00:05:29,021 --> 00:05:34,385
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my second year, and I'm here with two colleagues who are teachers at the Curtis Tufts.

71
00:05:35,857 --> 00:05:36,758
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm Kate Willard.

72
00:05:36,778 --> 00:05:42,181
[SPEAKER_10]: We're all special ed teachers, but I'm teaching math at the Curtis Tufts.

73
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:47,723
[SPEAKER_10]: This is my first year here, but I was at the Andrews Middle School for nine years before that.

74
00:05:48,444 --> 00:05:50,385
[SPEAKER_10]: And tell Nev I said hi.

75
00:05:50,545 --> 00:05:51,065
[SPEAKER_09]: I will.

76
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:53,406
[SPEAKER_09]: She's at Travers Ed right now.

77
00:05:53,947 --> 00:05:54,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, good.

78
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:56,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Tom Morris.

79
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:58,709
[SPEAKER_05]: I started at Curtis Tufts this year.

80
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:02,051
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a special educator, and my focus right now is on science.

81
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:05,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Wonderful.

82
00:06:06,423 --> 00:06:12,069
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good to know is in the room, a little easier when we're actually in person, but then we all can make it so so.

83
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:32,125
[SPEAKER_09]: At the school committee meeting where we had this motion made, we had, really wasn't the point of the topic or the conversation going on, but there was, I forget the person's name, who is not actually able to make it here, is the director of the program over at Somerville.

84
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:36,225
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe in Somerville, they used to have a program separated very much like we have.

85
00:06:36,786 --> 00:06:40,026
[SPEAKER_09]: And then when they rebuilt Somerville High, are they actually done?

86
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:42,607
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been the longest project in history, it seems.

87
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:57,552
[SPEAKER_09]: When they rebuilt Somerville High, they added, I don't know if it's a wing, we haven't actually taken a tour yet, for their alternative high school students and apparently it has been beyond wonderful.

88
00:06:57,932 --> 00:07:03,974
[SPEAKER_09]: He described dramatic increases in participation of those students in extracurriculars,

89
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:11,578
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, sporting and club presidents and things that are very difficult when you're not located with the rest of the student body.

90
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:24,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And obviously we'll want to take a peek at that if we do make this recommendation so we can have that information for the, our MSBA project for a reimagined high school.

91
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:26,444
[SPEAKER_09]: But that was sort of,

92
00:07:27,885 --> 00:07:29,926
[SPEAKER_09]: It was nice that he came, because it was very surprising.

93
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:40,229
[SPEAKER_09]: I really had no strong sense of this issue, other than the facilities of the Curtis Tufts are a challenge.

94
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:54,774
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wrote three things down, opportunities for students, which I just spoke to, facilities, which facilities at Curtis Tufts versus Medford High is one thing, but the facilities of the Curtis Tufts at a perhaps

95
00:07:55,834 --> 00:08:00,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Glossy, beautiful, new Medford High would be a different juxtaposition.

96
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,224
[SPEAKER_09]: This little fly is going to make me crazy.

97
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:06,687
[SPEAKER_09]: So anyways.

98
00:08:08,892 --> 00:08:26,016
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had talked, I can't remember with who, about if we did bring the school over, bring them together, maybe we could have a separate entrance, separate start and end times, some kind of partitioning if that actually is appropriate and OK and works.

99
00:08:26,836 --> 00:08:30,137
[SPEAKER_09]: But there were ways to retain.

100
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:38,619
[SPEAKER_09]: What I have heard is that the students in the Curtis-Tufts and other alternative high schools, the key for them is they're not with

101
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,005
[SPEAKER_09]: the rest of the student body, maybe even some of the staff, like that they are in fact not there.

102
00:08:44,025 --> 00:08:44,786
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the point.

103
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:50,212
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think I'm done talking and I would like to hear what anybody else, oh, Ms.

104
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:52,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Bowman, would you like to give us a little history lesson?

105
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

106
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,501
[SPEAKER_06]: So the Curtis Tufts was created back in 1982.

107
00:08:58,101 --> 00:09:02,143
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been long standing part of Medford Public Schools.

108
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:06,824
[SPEAKER_06]: It is what we call our public day therapeutic program.

109
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:08,525
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a small

110
00:09:10,226 --> 00:09:14,608
[SPEAKER_06]: school setting for students who are on individualized education plans.

111
00:09:15,349 --> 00:09:23,714
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of the students have social emotional disabilities and the big setting of the high school is too much for them.

112
00:09:24,634 --> 00:09:29,417
[SPEAKER_06]: We offer smaller classes, smaller teacher to student ratio.

113
00:09:30,378 --> 00:09:33,800
[SPEAKER_06]: There is individual counseling, group counseling.

114
00:09:36,222 --> 00:09:39,745
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more of a community within the Curtis-Tufts.

115
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:43,327
[SPEAKER_06]: The staff and students eat lunch together.

116
00:09:43,347 --> 00:09:57,276
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a community time breaks for them to build relationships and have those staff members that they trust while they are working on their academics to receive their high school diploma.

117
00:09:57,316 --> 00:09:59,078
[SPEAKER_06]: So every student from Curtis-Tufts

118
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:05,703
[SPEAKER_06]: earns the same amount of credits that Medford High School or Medford Vocational Technical High School student does.

119
00:10:06,303 --> 00:10:14,210
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also have opportunities in which the students choose to participate in extracurricular activities here at Medford High School.

120
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,072
[SPEAKER_06]: They can also be involved in sports.

121
00:10:17,512 --> 00:10:20,835
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also have students who, when they're ready,

122
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:28,002
[SPEAKER_06]: They may want to transition to Medford High School for an academic class, and we provide those opportunities for them.

123
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:31,166
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very individualized for the students' needs.

124
00:10:31,947 --> 00:10:33,608
[SPEAKER_06]: We have four academic teachers.

125
00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:35,310
[SPEAKER_06]: We have two Councilors.

126
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:41,217
[SPEAKER_06]: One is a school adjustment Councilor, and the other is a school Councilor slash guidance Councilor.

127
00:10:41,677 --> 00:10:45,781
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as the principal Dr. Laurie Hodgdon.

128
00:10:47,202 --> 00:11:04,299
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a great program that has provided a lot of services for students over the years and I'm interested in hearing what the staff have to say about the possibility of being at the high school because I do think it will provide our students even more opportunities

129
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:15,482
[SPEAKER_06]: like the gentleman from Full Circle or Full Scale had communicated with us, there are pros and cons, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons.

130
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:32,968
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's what I'm interested in hearing, but I'm also, I'd like to see the Curtis Tufts be able to experience a newer school building and facilities and just let the students know that they are important to us and we value them as much as we do any other student in Medford.

131
00:11:35,905 --> 00:11:37,165
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, that was helpful.

132
00:11:37,726 --> 00:11:39,886
[SPEAKER_09]: I was not on the school committee in 1982.

133
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I was 11.

134
00:11:45,148 --> 00:11:46,429
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's wonderful history.

135
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:54,751
[SPEAKER_09]: I would just ask, do you have any data on size of the student population served during that time?

136
00:11:55,111 --> 00:12:02,234
[SPEAKER_09]: And I realized it varies dramatically even within a single year, but did it used to be much bigger or was it just two to three students when it started?

137
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:07,617
[SPEAKER_06]: Nope, the Curtis Tufts previously had an enrollment up to 40 students.

138
00:12:08,017 --> 00:12:10,458
[SPEAKER_06]: So there were times that it was fully enrolled.

139
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:22,323
[SPEAKER_06]: And we also had opportunities to have students from other districts tuitioned into the Curtis Tufts because a lot, Everett, Malden, Revere, Chelsea did not have

140
00:12:22,883 --> 00:12:25,325
[SPEAKER_06]: their own public day programs at that time.

141
00:12:25,706 --> 00:12:30,490
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also needed the type of services that the Curtis Tufts offers.

142
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,174
[SPEAKER_06]: So we were able to tuition in students and we have done that in the past.

143
00:12:36,475 --> 00:12:44,041
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently our enrollment varies from 15 to 20 students, but there is that opportunity to increase enrollment as well.

144
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:46,903
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

145
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:50,153
[SPEAKER_09]: That's great.

146
00:12:50,213 --> 00:12:59,418
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, mostly I know about the Curtis Tufts when we used to go for the delightful Thanksgiving dinners, which I, no pressure, but I would love it if those started again.

147
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:00,619
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really very nice.

148
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:11,824
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to hear from the staff, I think is really an important folks to who are there every day.

149
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:20,005
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

150
00:13:20,025 --> 00:13:20,265
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

151
00:13:22,006 --> 00:13:22,866
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Tom.

152
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:25,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I can go first and break the ice.

153
00:13:25,907 --> 00:13:26,568
[SPEAKER_05]: Be the brave one.

154
00:13:26,608 --> 00:13:27,248
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm new, right?

155
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:29,549
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm new to the district, and I'm new to the team here.

156
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:35,311
[SPEAKER_05]: 16 years in education, working with at-risk youth, always as a special educator.

157
00:13:36,892 --> 00:13:44,135
[SPEAKER_05]: My experience in both settings has been different, and there are benefits, in my personal opinion, to both.

158
00:13:44,975 --> 00:14:06,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And in a program such as the one that we work in with Dr. Laurie, we have an unbelievable ability to make immediate real time shifts and the way that we address student need and the locations that we're addressing those needs and providing opportunities for community based learning as well as space and separation.

159
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:08,262
[SPEAKER_05]: when people need that time to process.

160
00:14:08,662 --> 00:14:11,303
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we do here, we use the full space.

161
00:14:11,703 --> 00:14:19,686
[SPEAKER_05]: So the benefit of having this space is that we have the room to do what we need to do, not only for safety, but also for a student's growth trajectory.

162
00:14:20,066 --> 00:14:27,469
[SPEAKER_05]: So if a student needs to process for five minutes or think for five minutes before processing, we have the time and the space to be able to do that.

163
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:45,487
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, because we're at a separate location, one of the downsides to having the separate location and the cost of this space is that sometimes students can come in and say they feel like they've been, I'll be honest, I'm just going to use student language when they're angry,

164
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,229
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like I've been thrown away.

165
00:14:47,729 --> 00:14:50,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that can be a challenge, right?

166
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:52,294
[SPEAKER_05]: That is not the truth.

167
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:58,561
[SPEAKER_05]: That is the experience in the words that they sometimes, not in every case, used to describe that situation.

168
00:14:58,681 --> 00:14:59,802
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not specific to here.

169
00:14:59,862 --> 00:15:02,345
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a 16-year trajectory seeing these things happen.

170
00:15:04,107 --> 00:15:23,184
[SPEAKER_05]: When the programs are housed in the high school, I founded a program in the Webster public school system, which is in southern Worcester County, heavily DCF, DYS involved, a lot of generational poverty, multicultural, very diverse, with a lot of intense needs.

171
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:27,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Which, by the way, congratulations to the superintendent.

172
00:15:28,526 --> 00:15:35,248
[SPEAKER_05]: They were also in Enough Abuse Campaign District, and that work was amazing, so I just want to give a shout out there.

173
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:48,252
[SPEAKER_05]: But with that said, what I saw in the building, when the program was housed in the building, benefits were that when a student had earned opportunities and shown good self-regulation, engagement, community skills,

174
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:58,154
[SPEAKER_05]: they did have opportunities to return for a period of day easier than it would have otherwise been to get a van to transport the kid back and forth, the student back and forth.

175
00:15:58,194 --> 00:15:59,434
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was one advantage.

176
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:07,876
[SPEAKER_05]: A disadvantage was that a couple of times students showed up to the door looking for drama with students who were trying to separate themselves.

177
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:16,999
[SPEAKER_05]: They have said, I want to go to this alternative mindset and not stay in the mainstream mindset that I had of engaging in drama.

178
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:18,299
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes when

179
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:24,341
[SPEAKER_05]: In the same building, the drama found the student who had already made the decision to try to walk away.

180
00:16:24,821 --> 00:16:26,482
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when that drama follows them.

181
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:34,784
[SPEAKER_05]: It was sometimes hard for them to continue to maintain that separation between the decisions they've made yesterday and the ones they want to make today.

182
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:37,445
[SPEAKER_05]: So I believe that there was a benefit.

183
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:38,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said, with the

184
00:16:39,266 --> 00:16:43,187
[SPEAKER_05]: continuity between students in the broader community.

185
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:55,170
[SPEAKER_05]: That said, the challenge was it wasn't always easy to separate from what that student was really truly trying to separate from so they could move forward and re-engage when they were ready.

186
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:01,451
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't allow the full buffer that a separate location had otherwise offered in other years of my experience.

187
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:04,374
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty much all I have to really say right now.

188
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:05,294
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to get wordy.

189
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:07,536
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to share that I've worked in both.

190
00:17:07,596 --> 00:17:11,599
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just wanted to give you my sense of some strengths and challenges that we face in both.

191
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:12,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there any questions for me?

192
00:17:13,981 --> 00:17:14,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Please.

193
00:17:14,981 --> 00:17:15,562
[SPEAKER_09]: I have questions.

194
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:19,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody, member Olapade, anybody else have questions before I go?

195
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:20,565
[SPEAKER_09]: So,

196
00:17:23,604 --> 00:17:24,625
[SPEAKER_09]: The buffer wasn't good enough.

197
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:30,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Really, that's a key element of this conversation, frankly.

198
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:33,214
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you describe what it was like there?

199
00:17:34,738 --> 00:17:40,459
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, was it just everybody came through the same main entrance of the schools or how was it laid out?

200
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:45,140
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not asking for an architectural drawing or anything, but help me understand.

201
00:17:45,561 --> 00:17:48,601
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a great question and I'm very glad you asked it.

202
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:58,704
[SPEAKER_05]: We, and I can also repeat that this situation existed not just in Webster, but also in Haverhill because I founded that program as well.

203
00:17:59,304 --> 00:18:03,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And in both cases, I demanded access to an alternative entrance.

204
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:14,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I wanted students to be able to arrive five minutes after the buses or 10 minutes before the buses and not have to engage if they weren't feeling ready.

205
00:18:15,133 --> 00:18:22,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that student should have the right to say, I'm not ready to engage in big community right now, and I need to work on my own self.

206
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:25,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that student is able to then advocate because that opportunity exists.

207
00:18:25,962 --> 00:18:27,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And without it, they couldn't ask for that.

208
00:18:27,943 --> 00:18:37,212
[SPEAKER_05]: So that buffer was important when it's in the building to be able to have a separate entrance to be able to have a student who needs to leave and be able to leave through a separate entrance as well.

209
00:18:38,393 --> 00:18:42,116
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes they might leave with some colorful language and it might be a bit poetic.

210
00:18:42,517 --> 00:18:47,942
[SPEAKER_05]: There might be some stomping and a door slamming and there's no need for there to be secondary trauma for others.

211
00:18:48,963 --> 00:18:55,730
[SPEAKER_05]: So that allowed us to give the student the space they needed to have their needs met in a safe way.

212
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,632
[SPEAKER_05]: So that separate entrance was key.

213
00:18:58,092 --> 00:19:04,079
[SPEAKER_05]: The second thing we did was we were super intentional about where we chose to put the programs.

214
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,464
[SPEAKER_05]: And we always chose based on access to the nurse.

215
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:14,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Because no matter in a building, students are going to need to access the nurse.

216
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:20,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So we tried to make the nursing our wing connected based on where the nurse was.

217
00:19:20,448 --> 00:19:26,770
[SPEAKER_05]: So the nurse's office in Haverhill, I'm sorry, in Webster existed here and then the wing started beyond that.

218
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:28,110
[SPEAKER_05]: So it worked perfectly.

219
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,191
[SPEAKER_05]: In Haverhill, we had to make it

220
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:34,833
[SPEAKER_05]: and a separate wing that was near the nurse's office.

221
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:37,134
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was what we were doing there.

222
00:19:37,174 --> 00:19:41,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was a super intentional thing we had to be mindful of based on entrances.

223
00:19:41,657 --> 00:19:54,284
[SPEAKER_05]: A second reason for this is a lot of the students who end up in these therapeutic day school programs come with significant trauma histories as well as significant current anxiety and depression.

224
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,726
[SPEAKER_05]: And when a student is not feeling like they are

225
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:02,367
[SPEAKER_05]: good enough for themselves, they don't want a large audience.

226
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:05,268
[SPEAKER_05]: And we call a student with that profile an internalizer.

227
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:22,793
[SPEAKER_05]: So that student who's internalizing walks through the front door and sees two kids arguing, just might happen in any school in the country, and they immediately shut down for the rest of the day because their comfortable people weren't around, their safe zone wasn't immediately available, they had to navigate a hallway to get to it, and they had panic.

228
00:20:22,853 --> 00:20:25,814
[SPEAKER_05]: So they had to live with a panic attack without their supports nearby.

229
00:20:26,454 --> 00:20:27,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that that's a challenge.

230
00:20:28,017 --> 00:20:30,581
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we had that separate entrance, we had kids that were school.

231
00:20:31,002 --> 00:20:35,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to use the word school avoidant because I don't choose to love the word school refuser.

232
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:40,457
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had school avoidant kids who that was the change for them.

233
00:20:41,436 --> 00:20:44,600
[SPEAKER_05]: that I can come to school again because I can go through a separate entrance.

234
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,664
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it's in the building, that was my take, that that separate entrance was key.

235
00:20:48,724 --> 00:20:50,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Haverhill was more complicated.

236
00:20:50,527 --> 00:20:59,997
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually had to get special permission for security to allow parents to drop off at around the back of the building where other parents are not allowed to drive during drop off.

237
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:05,083
[SPEAKER_05]: We had to have security aware of what their cars were, what they looked like, so they wouldn't stop them and let them through.

238
00:21:05,924 --> 00:21:11,991
[SPEAKER_05]: Then when the student went through, we had to have a system whereby they could be let in and have it be marked at the office.

239
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:20,000
[SPEAKER_05]: So we would always stop at the principal clerk's office and they would timestamp the arrival so that it was official and on the books for safety and liability.

240
00:21:21,142 --> 00:21:26,309
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if the student left through that separate entrance, they would have to leave through that same assistant principal's office.

241
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:35,102
[SPEAKER_05]: So we found a makeshift way to have a kind of like a main office for this subseparate program, because of where we made it proximate to.

242
00:21:35,743 --> 00:21:43,970
[SPEAKER_05]: approximate to another administrative office that could that clerk could do the intake outtake paperwork and make it official for attendance and liability and safety.

243
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:57,281
[SPEAKER_05]: It also helped with fire drills and ALICE and any kind of evacuation drills because we were so close to our exits and our kids practiced them that we had points that were not in the main lineup for a fire drill.

244
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:59,403
[SPEAKER_05]: We were like we went far beyond that.

245
00:21:59,463 --> 00:22:00,064
[SPEAKER_05]: We went like

246
00:22:00,724 --> 00:22:06,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Another 200 yards pass where everyone else lined up so our kids didn't have to be in the chaos while they were trying to recover from the loud noises.

247
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty much the long version of it.

248
00:22:10,693 --> 00:22:12,615
[SPEAKER_05]: But you asked a question, so I hope that was insight.

249
00:22:13,503 --> 00:22:32,391
[SPEAKER_09]: It was, I mean, honestly, like the number of things to consider, like the fire drill location for these students, honestly, it would never have occurred to me, not that I'm asked to, but clearly there are a million and one little things that have to be considered if this decision is to co-locate.

250
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:35,973
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not just a matter of a set of classrooms.

251
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:39,995
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a student who wouldn't leave the building.

252
00:22:41,473 --> 00:22:43,835
[SPEAKER_05]: one day because they didn't want to go in the mass audience.

253
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And so then we immediately changed that.

254
00:22:46,397 --> 00:22:47,519
[SPEAKER_05]: So we learn as we go.

255
00:22:47,599 --> 00:23:02,253
[SPEAKER_05]: And I anticipate that everyone who, if this happens, that it's cohabitating, I think everyone's going to have to keep an open, really open, flexible mind for that first year while the kinks get worked out, because there's going to be stuff that happens that can never be predicted.

256
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:06,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we should do, I think, is predict that things that are unexpected are going to happen.

257
00:23:06,998 --> 00:23:16,085
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need to just be prepared to not take it personal and just have honest, open communication and hard conversations that not everyone's going to agree on, but we're going to come to consensus.

258
00:23:16,466 --> 00:23:21,911
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are some of the challenges that we faced as teams in those two buildings where we had it in-house.

259
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:22,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

260
00:23:22,981 --> 00:23:27,804
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a remarkably helpful set of information.

261
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:38,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that, you know, when we're reimagining Medford High School, whether we rebuild or renovate, obviously, nobody's surprised to know that I want to rebuild the new building.

262
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:44,413
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, like a separate entrance, that was like my thing.

263
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:53,406
[SPEAKER_09]: There are really a long list, by the way, if we make this decision, I think it might be helpful for current Curtis tough staff.

264
00:23:54,530 --> 00:24:07,114
[SPEAKER_09]: to just open a Google Doc and start writing all the things you can think of, which may be important inputs to a design of a structure that those of us that are not there wouldn't consider.

265
00:24:07,194 --> 00:24:16,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Because while we're not at the phase now where we're not doing the feasibility study right now on what the building might look like or where it would be or any of that stuff,

266
00:24:18,887 --> 00:24:20,568
[SPEAKER_09]: that's all gonna come and that's gonna happen.

267
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:35,439
[SPEAKER_09]: It's gonna just, once we get through this first phase of eligibility, which is proving that we can do this work, it feels like that's gonna happen just like all at once.

268
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:45,506
[SPEAKER_09]: And so any headstart you can get on a list of things that you think are important considerations in the design of a space, if that is inside or,

269
00:24:46,913 --> 00:24:47,634
[SPEAKER_09]: co-located.

270
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:50,156
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know the rules.

271
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:56,201
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know if the state would physically a separate building right on the same property.

272
00:24:56,362 --> 00:25:00,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think any of us know the answer to what they think is acceptable.

273
00:25:01,546 --> 00:25:03,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I think about things like food services.

274
00:25:03,908 --> 00:25:04,949
[SPEAKER_09]: You brought up nursing.

275
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:06,871
[SPEAKER_09]: There are other services for which

276
00:25:09,026 --> 00:25:12,729
[SPEAKER_09]: having that, you know, whether it's a separate wing or whether there's a little bridge.

277
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:14,750
[SPEAKER_09]: We talked a lot about bridges in one of our meetings.

278
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:19,294
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody wants a bridge to their own program now, which why not, right?

279
00:25:20,155 --> 00:25:26,960
[SPEAKER_09]: But yeah, if you can, I'm guessing that like most of us, you will think of something you wish you had said later.

280
00:25:27,801 --> 00:25:28,981
[SPEAKER_09]: So write those things down.

281
00:25:29,022 --> 00:25:33,205
[SPEAKER_09]: You can send them to me or open a Google doc for your staff, because I think that would be great.

282
00:25:35,466 --> 00:25:36,527
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, go ahead.

283
00:25:36,587 --> 00:25:37,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Go ahead.

284
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:38,068
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I'm done.

285
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:45,192
[SPEAKER_10]: I actually did put together a Google Doc because I like spreadsheets.

286
00:25:46,353 --> 00:25:59,460
[SPEAKER_10]: Aside from the design of it, I have a list of benefits that we would love to see happen that would be available if we're co-locating, as well as concerns.

287
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:03,043
[SPEAKER_10]: I was talking to a few students today who have been here for

288
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:09,925
[SPEAKER_10]: three plus years who, you know, I presented the idea and what do you think of this?

289
00:26:10,786 --> 00:26:12,926
[SPEAKER_10]: So do you mind if I just go through?

290
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:13,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Go right ahead.

291
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:14,527
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you so much.

292
00:26:14,627 --> 00:26:25,751
[SPEAKER_10]: So what we, so benefits we see to this happening is access to vocational programs, access to student support services like reading, speech, etc.

293
00:26:25,831 --> 00:26:27,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Now if a student does need that,

294
00:26:29,173 --> 00:26:43,242
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have speech pathologists come down and provide that service, but it's really not ideal because they're based in another school and scheduling is very difficult.

295
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:49,047
[SPEAKER_10]: Access to a nurse within the building would be helpful.

296
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:52,609
[SPEAKER_10]: There's that.

297
00:26:52,789 --> 00:27:09,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Feeling more included within the high school community, because again, a lot of students who are newly placed here really struggle with the idea that they have been punished in some way, that they've been thrown out by coming here.

298
00:27:09,942 --> 00:27:15,727
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally love it here, and I chose to work here, and this has been the best school year I've had.

299
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:24,831
[SPEAKER_10]: So I speak very highly of the community, and we want to keep it growing.

300
00:27:24,951 --> 00:27:28,952
[SPEAKER_10]: So we try and make them feel welcome.

301
00:27:29,032 --> 00:27:34,094
[SPEAKER_10]: And usually, when they come here, they're like, oh, actually, this is kind of great.

302
00:27:36,095 --> 00:27:46,682
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, do access to athletics, drama, music programs, all of that, which, again, they do have access to, but transportation is the issue.

303
00:27:47,683 --> 00:27:52,827
[SPEAKER_10]: So one of the students today was like, yeah, I could still do that, but it's too much hassle.

304
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:55,228
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just didn't do that.

305
00:27:56,389 --> 00:28:01,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, communication with events that are ongoing.

306
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:15,820
[SPEAKER_10]: would be helpful, like one student was saying today that she didn't even know when the junior prom was until she saw on social media that her peers were at the junior prom.

307
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:29,727
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's something that needs to be better handled right away to make sure that we're getting proper communication so that they can be included.

308
00:28:31,237 --> 00:28:41,861
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so, yeah, it's, you know, benefits will be access to resources access to electives with their peers right now we have electives teacher coming.

309
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,862
[SPEAKER_10]: So, again, coming from other schools, which, you know.

310
00:28:46,662 --> 00:28:52,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone who comes here is awesome and is great with the kids, but again, it's not ideal.

311
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:54,228
[SPEAKER_10]: It's disruptive for them.

312
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:58,211
[SPEAKER_10]: The kids don't really know them because they're only here once a week.

313
00:28:59,793 --> 00:29:05,837
[SPEAKER_10]: So having more consistent elective opportunities would be good.

314
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:08,760
[SPEAKER_10]: So one student said,

315
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:21,279
[SPEAKER_10]: she would feel less left out if they were, you know, whether it's the same building or like much closer than we are now.

316
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:28,425
[SPEAKER_10]: She said it would be easier to join clubs and sports, which is too much of a hassle now.

317
00:29:28,445 --> 00:29:35,390
[SPEAKER_10]: And it would be nice to have the option to see more peers in the cafeteria for lunch, that sort of thing.

318
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:40,874
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, as much as they like having lunch with us.

319
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:59,039
[SPEAKER_10]: And then concerns I put together are, you know, the potential for peer drama, conflict, distractions from the larger community, which a lot of them are happy to no longer be a part of.

320
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:05,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Unstructured time within the larger settings is going to be very difficult.

321
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:10,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Flexibility within the curriculum, so making sure that

322
00:30:12,362 --> 00:30:23,132
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're trying to do more project-based learning, and so making sure we would still have flexibility to, you know, really individualize what these students need.

323
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:31,739
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of them have social-emotional behavior issues, but they also have, you know, learning disabilities as well.

324
00:30:33,441 --> 00:30:53,003
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I know this isn't on the table right now, but one of my concerns is that if we're within the same complex, I wouldn't want to lose a director of this program, because even though our numbers aren't huge, I understand that

325
00:30:53,764 --> 00:31:11,368
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, you know, having taught in TLP before and understanding the other sub-separate special education programs, this is really unique and really different in the sense of community and how it's run.

326
00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:18,829
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think that would be really detrimental if we lost a director lead for that.

327
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,570
[SPEAKER_10]: And then

328
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:23,666
[SPEAKER_10]: student concerns.

329
00:31:24,746 --> 00:31:31,149
[SPEAKER_10]: One student said I needed to come to the Curtis because it was hard for me to be around so many people.

330
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:40,374
[SPEAKER_10]: She wanted to make sure there's an option for a quieter space for lunch and break time.

331
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:46,657
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think the idea of having the flexibility there, so having the option, but some students

332
00:31:47,457 --> 00:31:54,362
[SPEAKER_10]: either, you know, wouldn't choose it or it wouldn't be in their best interest.

333
00:31:54,542 --> 00:32:04,550
[SPEAKER_10]: And then one student said the high school would need to be way better organized in order to have the Curtis stuffs there to support us.

334
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:04,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

335
00:32:07,212 --> 00:32:08,674
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotta love the student feedback.

336
00:32:09,475 --> 00:32:11,157
[SPEAKER_10]: They were very forthcoming.

337
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:13,860
[SPEAKER_10]: They were like, let me tell you what we think.

338
00:32:15,221 --> 00:32:17,183
[SPEAKER_10]: So I shared this document with you.

339
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:21,628
[SPEAKER_10]: And if I think of other things, I'll add to it.

340
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:24,351
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think there are a lot of benefits.

341
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:31,294
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I think the separate entrance and exit would definitely be important.

342
00:32:31,634 --> 00:32:42,218
[SPEAKER_10]: Having the space that is separated enough, but not excluding having them missing out on these other resources.

343
00:32:42,318 --> 00:32:44,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Which brings me to my point of onboarding.

344
00:32:44,999 --> 00:32:49,221
[SPEAKER_05]: When a student transitions and it's an internally placed housed program,

345
00:32:50,775 --> 00:33:00,104
[SPEAKER_05]: if the student's need is such that they may not be appropriate for the large format cafeteria because of their special needs, that is a more restrictive environment.

346
00:33:00,224 --> 00:33:02,666
[SPEAKER_05]: So we call that least restrictive LRE, right?

347
00:33:03,307 --> 00:33:16,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So in my opinion, my experience has been that we need to have a really specific conversation around LRE when we're in the same building, because the only way I found success

348
00:33:17,297 --> 00:33:18,339
[SPEAKER_05]: There can be many others.

349
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:25,247
[SPEAKER_05]: The only one that I truly found that worked across a couple of settings was to have some type of a system of access whereby a student wants it.

350
00:33:26,174 --> 00:33:48,858
[SPEAKER_05]: two they show that they're ready for it through by meeting criteria that's measurable and then three they have it once they get it as long as they're able to continue to maintain that but this is a continuum so at some point they can cave back in and sometimes they'll see that caving back in as a punishment because they want that cafeteria they want that drama and they want all 20 of those lunch tables staring at them when they confront this

351
00:33:49,378 --> 00:33:50,839
[SPEAKER_05]: person about whatever issue.

352
00:33:50,919 --> 00:34:07,668
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do have the potential for sticky situations and having intentional conversations up front about the LRE can certainly alleviate some litigiousness on the back end when people start to get into the draconian language of that and what does it mean.

353
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:17,614
[SPEAKER_05]: So proper expectations just need to be super clear in my opinion up front on that transition into the therapeutic day school program if it's housed in the same building.

354
00:34:18,374 --> 00:34:23,197
[SPEAKER_05]: No kid here can complain that they can't access the cafeteria because we're across town.

355
00:34:23,217 --> 00:34:26,279
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to get on a city bus and take it across town just to eat lunch.

356
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:32,162
[SPEAKER_05]: But when it's 100 yards down the hall, they can sometimes dig their heels in and complain a bit.

357
00:34:33,703 --> 00:34:39,466
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, I just wanted to make sure that we didn't fail to mention that.

358
00:34:39,526 --> 00:34:40,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Access is great.

359
00:34:40,987 --> 00:34:46,250
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll also need to manage the conversations around how, when, and for how long is appropriate and so forth.

360
00:34:47,725 --> 00:34:50,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, thank you, that's a lot to digest.

361
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:54,426
[SPEAKER_05]: We live so it's like.

362
00:34:54,546 --> 00:35:10,369
[SPEAKER_10]: We're really passionate about community and these students, they are overcoming so much all the time and we want them to be as successful as possible.

363
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:12,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

364
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Lori, did you wanna speak on anything?

365
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,471
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, do I have the best staff in the city?

366
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:35,096
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't have much to say other than I get to lead them and manage and make it easier for them to do what they're doing, which is really good work, but also to be innovative and support students in a way that personalizes their learning, right?

367
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:39,518
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I see, I don't, I like to call it, you know,

368
00:35:40,558 --> 00:35:44,359
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities for improvement for all of our students.

369
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:48,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are re-imagining the high school, what does that look like?

370
00:35:49,440 --> 00:36:06,903
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for someone who's been a principal of a small rural high school, a large suburban high school, a charter school director, I really, after COVID, and Joan knows this, was ready to work with kids who were the most marginalized.

371
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:10,426
[SPEAKER_02]: and the kids who are at Promise.

372
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:18,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for me, I've been able to realize that here, but within that, I'm thinking more systems and all students.

373
00:36:19,288 --> 00:36:22,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And the work that we're doing here needs to happen for every kid.

374
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:33,951
[SPEAKER_02]: And so wouldn't it be cool to have a pilot of people doing project-based learning that can push on other professionals in a larger high school scenario?

375
00:36:34,031 --> 00:36:37,612
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm thinking, they're thinking the day-to-day, I'm thinking big picture.

376
00:36:39,473 --> 00:36:45,257
[SPEAKER_02]: And also what it means for kids to know, I agree, it needs to be a separate entrance.

377
00:36:45,597 --> 00:36:51,060
[SPEAKER_02]: We may have to have a small cafeteria, there needs to be a director, all of those things.

378
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:59,785
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also think part of that is kind of thinking about how can we push on best practices in the high school that are evidence-based, right?

379
00:37:00,266 --> 00:37:04,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So that while we're working on those kids who need more support,

380
00:37:05,721 --> 00:37:13,023
[SPEAKER_02]: in the Curtis Tufts environment, right, they're coming out of a high school that's very large that needs to be pushed in different ways.

381
00:37:13,544 --> 00:37:27,008
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that kind of mutual renewal, if Curtis Tufts was co-localized, I like that word, to the high school would be supportive with all of our students across the city that go to a very large high school.

382
00:37:28,129 --> 00:37:31,672
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, it's about what's good high school practice?

383
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:35,176
[SPEAKER_02]: What's good practice for all students?

384
00:37:35,876 --> 00:37:45,846
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, how do you lead folks so that, because special ed is just really good individualized instruction with really good goals.

385
00:37:45,906 --> 00:37:49,289
[SPEAKER_02]: We should be doing something like this for every single kid, right?

386
00:37:50,070 --> 00:38:03,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I would love for it to be just professionally, we've talked about kids, wouldn't it be really cool to be an exemplar for other districts to see the work that we're doing with our kiddos, right?

387
00:38:04,025 --> 00:38:11,093
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I want, there are students and they don't, I'll tell you, they don't always feel like it's our.

388
00:38:12,494 --> 00:38:21,984
[SPEAKER_02]: they often feel, from my perspective, like they have been cast aside, even though intellectually we know that, but that's how they're feeling.

389
00:38:22,004 --> 00:38:32,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Because A, either they've come out of a situation that wasn't okay, and there's a need for them to be here, or B, it's just they need a smaller learning environment.

390
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:36,911
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're asked, well, why couldn't that happen in the high school?

391
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:40,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a lot of things that I'm kind of ruminating around.

392
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:44,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think there needs to be a lot of research done.

393
00:38:44,874 --> 00:38:48,915
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've never been a principal having a subseparate program.

394
00:38:49,955 --> 00:38:56,097
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was a gen ed principal and principal of the whole, I think there's going to be a lot that needs to be worked out.

395
00:38:56,337 --> 00:38:57,618
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of access,

396
00:38:59,198 --> 00:39:09,040
[SPEAKER_02]: and universal design and equity, our kids deserve to be in the new reimagined high school.

397
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just me.

398
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,201
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, I echo what everyone said.

399
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:15,341
[SPEAKER_02]: There are pros and there are cons to everything.

400
00:39:16,061 --> 00:39:26,223
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there needs to be a lot of research as we build a new high school around learning spaces and what, you know, I'll be excited to go and

401
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:35,116
[SPEAKER_02]: see what other schools are doing, because this is your building that you're going to have for the next 30 to 50 years, right?

402
00:39:35,797 --> 00:39:37,640
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it also has to be future ready.

403
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:39,356
[SPEAKER_02]: right for kids.

404
00:39:39,437 --> 00:39:42,238
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are just some things I'm thinking about.

405
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,162
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to answer any questions, also to get other folks' thoughts.

406
00:39:47,882 --> 00:39:53,466
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think you have a team that's ready and willing, and we just want to do the work.

407
00:39:53,626 --> 00:40:03,112
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll continue to do the good work we're doing here at Curtis Tufts now and continue to accept feedback from folks and do what's right for our students.

408
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:15,278
[SPEAKER_02]: We, I know, appreciate, and Tom and Nat and Leslie and Lance and Drew would have been here, but we were here representing.

409
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:21,501
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate the opportunity to be able, and we're happy to answer any questions.

410
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:23,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

411
00:40:23,942 --> 00:40:24,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

412
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:25,543
[SPEAKER_08]: All that.

413
00:40:26,143 --> 00:40:27,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Erin.

414
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:33,779
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a quick comment and something that I think many of you kind of spoke about.

415
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:35,600
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's also a culture thing.

416
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,322
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that some students had mentioned that it felt like a punishment.

417
00:40:39,743 --> 00:40:47,168
[SPEAKER_03]: And not only the physical separation, but also the way in which I think the communication about what the program is actually intended for.

418
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:53,512
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that that's a thing that takes a long time, but that's a top-bottom kind of process.

419
00:40:53,612 --> 00:40:54,553
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we really need to be

420
00:40:55,193 --> 00:41:10,363
[SPEAKER_03]: informing our staff and ourselves about how these types of programs operate, the therapeutic benefits of them, right, and what they're actually intended to accomplish over the year or years that students might be participating in them so that it doesn't feel like it's a negative.

421
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,403
[SPEAKER_03]: it just feels like school, right?

422
00:41:13,463 --> 00:41:18,444
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just learn differently, they just have different needs, and we wanna accommodate them to the best of our ability.

423
00:41:18,785 --> 00:41:33,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And that comes from us understanding why each student's actually in the program, how we can be better fit to work with them, so they don't feel as though they're being, I think, yeah, penalized for having a different set of needs to learn effectively.

424
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,071
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not just the way that they're retaining content, right?

425
00:41:37,091 --> 00:41:38,652
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a variety of other things that I think

426
00:41:39,332 --> 00:42:02,259
[SPEAKER_03]: individual to each of them and I think you know I'm pro I think having the space be moved closer and closer to the high school much as much as possible I do really I'm really interested on hearing more I think from students and faculty about how spaces are really important on smaller cafeterias smaller spaces that are still in the building for example how we can offer

427
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,882
[SPEAKER_03]: just less people, for even example, right?

428
00:42:05,962 --> 00:42:07,043
[SPEAKER_03]: How does that actually look?

429
00:42:07,523 --> 00:42:10,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Are those spaces going to always be just for the cursed tough students?

430
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:14,910
[SPEAKER_03]: Can those be spaces be used by other classrooms or faculty when they're not being used?

431
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:21,536
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we allow for all spaces to be used by multiple groups, if need be, so that it doesn't feel like it's separated?

432
00:42:21,556 --> 00:42:28,222
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that was something that I wondered about the Summerville program that we didn't get to really kind of elaborate on, is how does their

433
00:42:28,983 --> 00:42:44,203
[SPEAKER_03]: school, how does it integrate into the rest of the building, and is it just for their program, or do other groups use them throughout the school day, and how does that affect, I think, the students' perception about their stake in the school, if that makes sense.

434
00:42:44,583 --> 00:42:47,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Just something that, as we're continuing talking about, I just thought was really interesting.

435
00:42:48,235 --> 00:42:50,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just talk a little bit about culture?

436
00:42:52,037 --> 00:43:06,384
[SPEAKER_02]: So just for me, I think sometimes it's kids' reactions to moving to the Curtis Tufts, and I know that I can do a much better job of promoting Curtis Tufts and supporting other folks.

437
00:43:07,484 --> 00:43:08,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Joan said it best.

438
00:43:08,445 --> 00:43:16,270
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a program that started in 1982 that's been almost an institution that has supported all of our kids, but it has changed over time.

439
00:43:17,451 --> 00:43:21,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Marzano, who's an educational theorist, talks about the rule of 30.

440
00:43:21,554 --> 00:43:24,556
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes 30 years to lose a reputation.

441
00:43:25,196 --> 00:43:33,022
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's a perception that all the bad kids went here, and I'm not constantly educating people about or

442
00:43:33,902 --> 00:43:45,813
[SPEAKER_02]: stakeholders about the fact that it's really designed for therapeutic learning so that you get what you need both emotionally, socially, and academically, then that kind of sticks.

443
00:43:45,893 --> 00:43:51,218
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we're doing a really good job as kids on board.

444
00:43:51,278 --> 00:43:53,200
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reaction, of course, because it's changed.

445
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,062
[SPEAKER_02]: No teenager likes to change anything.

446
00:43:55,102 --> 00:43:57,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the day-to-day, the 24 hours, the hour-by-hour.

447
00:43:58,905 --> 00:44:05,814
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that perception is changing as, and for me, it's been all about who I'm hiring for staff.

448
00:44:07,084 --> 00:44:09,205
[SPEAKER_02]: and how they work with our students.

449
00:44:09,305 --> 00:44:17,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So I feel like I have an incredible team supported by Joan, Stacey Shulman, Maurice, the two assistant superintendents.

450
00:44:18,007 --> 00:44:20,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like we're allowed to be creative.

451
00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:24,610
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I've been in two high schools that have gone through building projects.

452
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:28,611
[SPEAKER_02]: And you talk a little bit, Aaron, about what does the design look like.

453
00:44:29,351 --> 00:44:47,932
[SPEAKER_02]: The school that I helped build in Vermont looked very different than the school, the mask and on it right so they built smaller learning communities, because they were focusing on freshmen coming from a regional kind of three towns, coming to a smaller because first year students struggle in high school.

454
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:51,455
[SPEAKER_02]: And they wanted to teach kind of academics, et cetera.

455
00:44:52,015 --> 00:44:55,457
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were housed in a different area from 10 through 12.

456
00:44:56,038 --> 00:44:57,659
[SPEAKER_02]: And they really focused on teaming.

457
00:44:58,179 --> 00:45:00,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I think design of the whole high school will be really important.

458
00:45:00,721 --> 00:45:06,845
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I'm saying, I think, and I haven't done any research about what the school of the future looks like with all of the technology.

459
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:08,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to be really important stuff.

460
00:45:09,366 --> 00:45:13,529
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it will support a culture and community.

461
00:45:18,138 --> 00:45:18,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

462
00:45:18,598 --> 00:45:20,439
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that rule of 30.

463
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:39,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's, I mean, it'd be interesting to, I mean, Aaron was a student not so long ago, but my guess is that 30 years is long gone, but I suspect that reputation is still there.

464
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:45,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I just add one thing?

465
00:45:45,245 --> 00:45:51,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Marzano also says that the rule of nine is you have to see it, hear it, to believe it for three years.

466
00:45:52,328 --> 00:45:58,571
[SPEAKER_09]: So having it in the same location would actually make a big impact on this.

467
00:45:58,591 --> 00:45:59,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different.

468
00:45:59,112 --> 00:46:02,393
[SPEAKER_02]: So I agree with the Somerville for having someone who's never done this.

469
00:46:03,054 --> 00:46:09,737
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes sense to me what the Somerville principal or director said, that in itself can change a perception.

470
00:46:11,241 --> 00:46:13,143
[SPEAKER_02]: physical movement to a new building.

471
00:46:13,603 --> 00:46:27,700
[SPEAKER_10]: I think even, you know, definitely among students and families, but staffing too, like we are so removed from all the other schools that nobody really knows what goes on.

472
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,963
[SPEAKER_10]: They hear rumors that, you know, we have a

473
00:46:31,924 --> 00:46:33,365
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor who's retiring.

474
00:46:33,405 --> 00:46:36,828
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been here for 27 years or something like that.

475
00:46:36,908 --> 00:46:42,492
[SPEAKER_10]: And he said, oh, you know, I always think it's funny when I hear about things that have happened here.

476
00:46:42,572 --> 00:46:46,234
[SPEAKER_10]: And, you know, I think I must have been out that day.

477
00:46:46,334 --> 00:46:46,735
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

478
00:46:48,596 --> 00:47:03,253
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think one way that having elective teachers come from other schools has kind of shed some light on that where they're like, oh, this is not what I thought.

479
00:47:03,653 --> 00:47:05,415
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not chaotic.

480
00:47:05,535 --> 00:47:06,296
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not.

481
00:47:07,377 --> 00:47:10,781
[SPEAKER_10]: It's I firmly believe there are no bad kids.

482
00:47:12,023 --> 00:47:14,926
[SPEAKER_10]: And I feel very, very strongly about that.

483
00:47:16,028 --> 00:47:21,534
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think I think that used to be one heart, by the way.

484
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:24,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Zoom just changed it.

485
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:24,908
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a flutter.

486
00:47:25,028 --> 00:47:25,688
[SPEAKER_10]: It was awesome.

487
00:47:26,088 --> 00:47:28,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I feel very strongly about that.

488
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:45,117
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I think having people from other buildings be with these kids, and some of them, you know, because they're coming from middle schools, they're coming from elementary schools, there are some staff that knew them from previous schools.

489
00:47:46,058 --> 00:47:57,909
[SPEAKER_10]: So they have some idea of who's over here, but I think their sense of what it is, what the program is, is different than the rumors.

490
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:04,415
[SPEAKER_10]: So I told my former colleagues all the time that, you know, I love it.

491
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:06,257
[SPEAKER_10]: And I loved working at the Andrews.

492
00:48:07,578 --> 00:48:12,381
[SPEAKER_10]: But many of my former colleagues were like, what are you doing?

493
00:48:14,702 --> 00:48:17,164
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm very happy with the choice that I made.

494
00:48:17,784 --> 00:48:23,588
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm happy you've made that choice because I think choosing something is different.

495
00:48:24,348 --> 00:48:25,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

496
00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:32,073
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing I want to try to clarify because we've all said it and I just want to make sure that we don't leave a misunderstood component.

497
00:48:33,133 --> 00:48:35,495
[SPEAKER_05]: The profile of a student who's not

498
00:48:36,945 --> 00:48:41,955
[SPEAKER_05]: thriving in the broader, in the least restricted environment, in the gen ed settings.

499
00:48:43,603 --> 00:48:45,725
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of learned helplessness that can happen in that.

500
00:48:46,446 --> 00:48:49,608
[SPEAKER_05]: There's generational poverty that some may be facing.

501
00:48:50,729 --> 00:49:03,239
[SPEAKER_05]: And the excuse mindset or blaming mindset can sometimes be intrinsic and inherent in that person, regardless of what's happened in school and what the system has done to support them or not.

502
00:49:03,959 --> 00:49:07,783
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to be clear that students that maybe

503
00:49:09,577 --> 00:49:13,946
[SPEAKER_05]: had the most love and care and attention and dedication to their transition.

504
00:49:15,023 --> 00:49:23,968
[SPEAKER_05]: simply are unable to see that, and by default will automatically say I've been tossed out, even when there has been so much love and attention.

505
00:49:24,388 --> 00:49:26,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I've been part of a transition here.

506
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:30,431
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to be honest, I'm very pleased with how that transition went.

507
00:49:31,251 --> 00:49:33,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Lori's done a great job of telling me what to expect.

508
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,054
[SPEAKER_05]: Lori set up a meeting for me to meet with the student.

509
00:49:37,075 --> 00:49:40,676
[SPEAKER_05]: I knew what was going to happen before it happened.

510
00:49:40,896 --> 00:49:43,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt confident in that transition.

511
00:49:44,418 --> 00:49:48,941
[SPEAKER_05]: But that said, no matter how much love and attention and intention is put into it.

512
00:49:49,521 --> 00:49:55,885
[SPEAKER_05]: We cannot control the words that come out of the mouths and the mindset the survival skills that have been developed over time.

513
00:49:56,525 --> 00:49:58,547
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes those ruts in the road run deep.

514
00:49:59,187 --> 00:50:04,291
[SPEAKER_05]: And no matter what we do, there will always be kids saying, I feel like I've been tossed out, whether it's in the building or not.

515
00:50:04,311 --> 00:50:12,377
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to be clear that no one leaves here thinking that there's been any part of this conversation where anyone here is feeling like things aren't done right.

516
00:50:12,537 --> 00:50:14,879
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more that that's just the student's mindset.

517
00:50:14,919 --> 00:50:16,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's who we're meeting.

518
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:20,384
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's where we have to meet them, because we can't move forward if we don't meet them where they're at.

519
00:50:20,964 --> 00:50:22,085
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just a reality.

520
00:50:22,105 --> 00:50:26,208
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to make sure that's been clear, because there's nothing negative in the statement.

521
00:50:26,248 --> 00:50:27,209
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a statement of fact.

522
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:29,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

523
00:50:29,219 --> 00:50:30,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

524
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,500
[SPEAKER_08]: Just trying to keep an eye on the time.

525
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:39,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody else want to add anything?

526
00:50:39,962 --> 00:50:44,763
[SPEAKER_09]: This isn't like the only opportunity you'll ever have, by the way.

527
00:50:47,023 --> 00:50:56,826
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, I think that what I'm hearing, and frankly, so far, I've heard really nobody arguing against us recommending this.

528
00:50:59,737 --> 00:51:05,162
[SPEAKER_09]: We, you know, the way this would work is that one of those two school committee members make a motion and second it.

529
00:51:05,262 --> 00:51:11,588
[SPEAKER_09]: And then presumably we would vote for making that recommendation that would go to the full school committee.

530
00:51:12,008 --> 00:51:17,413
[SPEAKER_09]: The school committee would make the policy decision that that is the goal.

531
00:51:18,695 --> 00:51:22,298
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not like, you know, this isn't happening in September or anything like that.

532
00:51:23,419 --> 00:51:23,839
[SPEAKER_09]: And that,

533
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:28,859
[SPEAKER_09]: From there, that would become part of our educational profile for the new building.

534
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:41,190
[SPEAKER_09]: And then of course, we're going to probably have to really spend, we already spent a lot of time together, the people in this Zoom with me, but we're going to have to spend even more time together to really

535
00:51:42,405 --> 00:51:49,571
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, until we have like a site study and that stuff that happens in the next phase, where we like, well, where could we put the building?

536
00:51:51,432 --> 00:51:57,557
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, could we renovate, which whatever, you know, those are the kinds of starting points.

537
00:51:57,637 --> 00:52:02,902
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels like, you know, I like the bridges idea all over the place, metaphorically as well.

538
00:52:03,982 --> 00:52:07,645
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, depending on where it is, it may not be possible.

539
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:10,428
[SPEAKER_09]: So I feel like, you know,

540
00:52:11,148 --> 00:52:15,972
[SPEAKER_09]: we're going to have to really dig in once we get to that point.

541
00:52:16,192 --> 00:52:30,124
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know that for the eligibility phase, the educational profile, I don't know how much detail we have to actually go into in that, but we'll meet and discuss that, assuming that it passes tonight and that the full committee supports it.

542
00:52:32,987 --> 00:52:35,569
[SPEAKER_09]: I took copious notes, although

543
00:52:37,478 --> 00:52:38,699
[SPEAKER_09]: There was so much more said, I'm sure.

544
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:51,371
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will try to write these up and just kind of highlight the key points in the event that the full school committee wants to really get into a dialogue about it.

545
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:55,956
[SPEAKER_09]: And if they don't, and they just want to like,

546
00:52:57,414 --> 00:53:00,196
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to say rubber stamp, because that's such a negative connotation.

547
00:53:00,236 --> 00:53:06,619
[SPEAKER_09]: But if they just want to like, yes, we agree and move on, then we won't necessarily go through this whole presentation at the school committee meeting.

548
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,902
[SPEAKER_09]: But this certainly will not be the last.

549
00:53:10,942 --> 00:53:14,364
[SPEAKER_09]: I feel like this is just the beginning, frankly, of this conversation.

550
00:53:14,924 --> 00:53:20,808
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not a six-month or a year-long conversation, which I think is good.

551
00:53:23,503 --> 00:53:50,201
[SPEAKER_09]: I really appreciated, I'm trying to remember who said this, might've been Lori, forgive me, I forget who said this, but I do strongly believe that every one of these kinds of opportunities, whether it's a new high school, whether it's bringing the Curtis Tufts into the same campus, that there is no reason for us to not be an exemplar to other communities,

552
00:53:51,548 --> 00:53:55,231
[SPEAKER_09]: And even why limit ourselves to Massachusetts?

553
00:53:55,351 --> 00:54:01,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just looking at a video from a school in Oklahoma, a very different kind of a setting.

554
00:54:01,616 --> 00:54:03,518
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have a lot more land and all this other stuff.

555
00:54:03,998 --> 00:54:17,268
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's no reason that when we're all done and we're all moved into a nice high school or new high school, that communities around the state and country aren't going, oh, look at this place.

556
00:54:17,368 --> 00:54:18,029
[SPEAKER_09]: We could do this.

557
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:28,715
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sometimes it would be difficult to put into a fun video when we're all done, you know, that makes a news story.

558
00:54:28,936 --> 00:54:32,517
[SPEAKER_09]: It's hard to put some of this stuff in particular into that.

559
00:54:32,537 --> 00:54:40,262
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you know, are we going to really is it, you know, is the news, you know, very, very brief stories going to include stuff like we brought our alternative

560
00:54:41,623 --> 00:54:42,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Joan, correct me.

561
00:54:42,643 --> 00:54:43,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it alternative high school?

562
00:54:44,084 --> 00:54:44,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Therapeutic?

563
00:54:44,925 --> 00:54:45,906
[SPEAKER_09]: Therapeutic.

564
00:54:46,406 --> 00:54:46,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

565
00:54:46,946 --> 00:54:48,547
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to stop and fix that.

566
00:54:48,627 --> 00:54:50,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a note to remember to start calling it that.

567
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:57,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Our therapeutic program into the main campus, that stuff's not going to make it.

568
00:54:57,314 --> 00:55:02,037
[SPEAKER_09]: But that doesn't mean we can't have a white paper when we're all done and say something so we can really help people.

569
00:55:02,377 --> 00:55:07,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we're reaching out to other school committees and other districts

570
00:55:08,637 --> 00:55:09,097
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot.

571
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:10,638
[SPEAKER_09]: How did it go?

572
00:55:10,658 --> 00:55:11,699
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you recommend?

573
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:13,200
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're going to be doing that to us.

574
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:20,964
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think if we can really show that we did this and we did it really well, you really should consider it.

575
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:25,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that does a service beyond just our students in Medford.

576
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:29,092
[SPEAKER_09]: And I greatly appreciate it when other places do that for us.

577
00:55:29,432 --> 00:55:33,334
[SPEAKER_09]: And they are very giving, sometimes surprisingly.

578
00:55:33,394 --> 00:55:35,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, can we have five hours to roam your school with you?

579
00:55:35,635 --> 00:55:35,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

580
00:55:35,835 --> 00:55:41,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you have half their staff, and they're like, don't you all have other things to do?

581
00:55:42,278 --> 00:55:46,240
[SPEAKER_09]: So if nobody has anything else they want to add,

582
00:55:48,134 --> 00:56:09,570
[SPEAKER_09]: If member Olapade would like to make a motion to recommend that the Curtis Tufts, I'm writing it down, the Curtis Tufts be co-localized, I am in love with that by the way, co-localized with the main Medford High School campus.

583
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:18,202
[SPEAKER_09]: campus because it is part of the high still you know I just that does that language sound okay to the folks that understand the stuff in detail.

584
00:56:19,243 --> 00:56:21,284
[SPEAKER_09]: That okay so that was that.

585
00:56:21,524 --> 00:56:24,465
[SPEAKER_09]: So if member of the body would like to make that motion.

586
00:56:25,346 --> 00:56:30,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I do I would like to make that motion that wonderful discuss it the rest of the committee.

587
00:56:30,608 --> 00:56:31,248
[SPEAKER_03]: The.

588
00:56:40,671 --> 00:56:43,932
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to have Mr. don't vote.

589
00:56:43,992 --> 00:56:44,852
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't know what we're saying.

590
00:56:44,912 --> 00:56:58,757
[SPEAKER_09]: Recommendation to co-localize Curtis Tufts with the main Medford High School campus by member Olapade, seconded by member Rousseau.

591
00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:05,279
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Olapade.

592
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:07,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

593
00:57:09,036 --> 00:57:14,440
[SPEAKER_09]: And members, so yes to the affirmative, the motion is approved.

594
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:18,183
[SPEAKER_09]: And anybody have any final words?

595
00:57:18,804 --> 00:57:20,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Or are we going to get two whole minutes back?

596
00:57:20,525 --> 00:57:20,766
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

597
00:57:21,306 --> 00:57:22,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I appreciate everybody's time today.

598
00:57:23,067 --> 00:57:28,872
[SPEAKER_09]: And this has been a fabulous meeting, especially since I was completely convinced I have no idea what we're going to talk about.

599
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:30,633
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you all.

600
00:57:31,134 --> 00:57:31,474
[SPEAKER_09]: Take care.

601
00:57:31,854 --> 00:57:32,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

602
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:32,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

603
00:57:32,895 --> 00:57:33,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a good night.

604
00:57:33,396 --> 00:57:34,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, good night.

605
00:57:34,176 --> 00:57:35,638
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got to adjourn, Member El-Fady.

606
00:57:36,238 --> 00:57:36,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to adjourn?

607
00:57:37,802 --> 00:57:38,083
[SPEAKER_03]: second.

608
00:57:38,103 --> 00:57:39,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

609
00:57:41,512 --> 00:57:42,234
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not good.

610
00:57:42,254 --> 00:57:46,305
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember all the party?

611
00:57:46,847 --> 00:57:47,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

00:57:47,669 --> 00:57:48,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Remember?

613
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:48,572
[SPEAKER_09]: So yes.

614
00:57:49,213 --> 00:57:49,414
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

615
00:57:49,635 --> 00:57:50,517
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the meeting is adjourned.

616
00:57:50,557 --> 00:57:50,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
