1
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:51,429
[SPEAKER_16]: and caregivers, so welcome, welcome, welcome to our school committee meeting this evening.

2
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,831
[SPEAKER_16]: So good evening and happy holidays.

3
00:35:55,811 --> 00:36:03,695
[SPEAKER_16]: December is here, marking the beginning of the holiday season for many different religious denominations and cultures.

4
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:12,979
[SPEAKER_16]: Many members of our local Jewish community will begin the observance of Hanukkah for eight nights beginning this Thursday evening.

5
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:25,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Hanukkah, sometimes called the Festival of Lights, is timely and welcome, coinciding with some of the shortest, darkest days of December.

6
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:34,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Regardless of your religious beliefs, this is the perfect time to seek some extra light and warmth to your dark evenings.

7
00:36:36,636 --> 00:36:44,281
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have many wonderful ongoing holiday fundraisers and I just want to take a moment to recognize them.

8
00:36:45,242 --> 00:36:50,965
[SPEAKER_16]: Our wonderful band members that are here, they are still selling Christmas trees and holiday wreaths.

9
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:55,811
[SPEAKER_16]: This, this particular fundraiser is a personal favorite of mine.

10
00:36:55,831 --> 00:37:09,086
[SPEAKER_16]: I get to pick a tree and with my daughter and pick some leaves and if you can get out there, they're wonderful quality trees and leaves, and I'm not receiving any commission for this wonderful.

11
00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:13,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Shout out to the band fundraiser, but it is great.

12
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:16,416
[SPEAKER_16]: It happened this weekend and next weekend.

13
00:37:16,556 --> 00:37:19,560
[SPEAKER_16]: So Saturday and Sunday come out between 10 and four.

14
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:21,823
[SPEAKER_16]: You can buy a tree or a wreath.

15
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:25,648
[SPEAKER_16]: And it takes place in the Medford High School parking lot.

16
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:34,723
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, all proceeds will benefit our wonderful award-winning band and color guard team.

17
00:37:35,664 --> 00:37:39,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, we have our sophomore class at the high school.

18
00:37:39,826 --> 00:37:43,307
[SPEAKER_16]: They're working with modern pastry this holiday season.

19
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:49,089
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, if you want to avoid the crazy lines in the stores, please put in an order.

20
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:52,151
[SPEAKER_16]: I shared the link last week in my Friday memo.

21
00:37:53,772 --> 00:38:00,865
[SPEAKER_16]: All orders will be accepted until December 14th and all proceeds will support our sophomore class.

22
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:21,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, just for those of you who are here and for the Medford community at large, if you've been anywhere near the McGlynn Andrews Complex campus, the McGlynn Playground has fencing around it right now, and that's for everyone's safety.

23
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:27,022
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're really excited because the McGlynn School Playground is going to be

24
00:38:28,496 --> 00:38:32,841
[SPEAKER_16]: our new universally accessible schoolyard.

25
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:37,987
[SPEAKER_16]: So there aren't many in Massachusetts, but it's going to be universally accessible.

26
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:48,659
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do believe we'll have a lot of visitors from neighboring communities coming to use our new park because it's accessible for all of our young people.

27
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,703
[SPEAKER_16]: So the construction was originally scheduled to begin in the spring.

28
00:38:55,304 --> 00:39:07,171
[SPEAKER_16]: However, the timetable got moved up and demolition is going to be taking place this week with the hope of still completing the playground on time.

29
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:09,773
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we're lucky, they might even finish a little early.

30
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:18,263
[SPEAKER_16]: So while the construction is taking place, the playground will be closed to the public during construction.

31
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:24,828
[SPEAKER_16]: That's the sad bit of news I know for our young folk, but it needs to be closed because it's no longer safe.

32
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:29,371
[SPEAKER_16]: So we do know that it was short notice, but we were given short notice.

33
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:35,256
[SPEAKER_16]: And as quickly as we found out, we turned around and made sure that we communicated that to the community.

34
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:41,384
[SPEAKER_16]: So if the McGlynn Playground was your playground of choice, you now have many other options.

35
00:39:41,885 --> 00:39:48,634
[SPEAKER_16]: Harris Playground, Magoon Playground, Logan, and the newly renovated Morrison Playground.

36
00:39:48,975 --> 00:39:50,778
[SPEAKER_16]: So there are many other options nearby.

37
00:39:53,246 --> 00:39:55,928
[SPEAKER_16]: Work will be taking place between 7 a.m.

38
00:39:55,968 --> 00:40:10,096
[SPEAKER_16]: and 3 p.m., and we are working with the construction company, so we want to make sure that we minimize disruption to arrival and dismissal times when you're dropping off and picking up your children.

39
00:40:10,196 --> 00:40:12,118
[SPEAKER_16]: So please, you know, keep us in the loop.

40
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:13,138
[SPEAKER_16]: Let us know.

41
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:20,723
[SPEAKER_16]: I do want to extend a very special thank you to our mayor, Breanna Lungo-Koehn, and to the Medford School Committee.

42
00:40:22,117 --> 00:40:24,969
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to thank City Hall staff, teachers,

43
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:30,056
[SPEAKER_16]: our staff in the schools and administrators.

44
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:33,497
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to thank our family and community partners.

45
00:40:33,957 --> 00:40:48,965
[SPEAKER_16]: And we also want to thank Shanine Pellequin, who is a parent and a great advocate and expert in the area of playgrounds, lending her expertise to really help us get the best playground possible for our students.

46
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:53,087
[SPEAKER_16]: So we thank all of you and the community at large for your support.

47
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:57,510
[SPEAKER_16]: Also, another important update for the community.

48
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,593
[SPEAKER_16]: It's about our elementary literacy screening.

49
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:07,619
[SPEAKER_16]: Elementary caregivers and families are invited to join our assistant superintendent, Ms.

50
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:18,709
[SPEAKER_16]: Suzanne Galusi, over there, and our literacy coach, Kristen Howell, for a presentation on early literacy screening for elementary students.

51
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:22,233
[SPEAKER_16]: You may have already received a message from Ms.

52
00:41:22,253 --> 00:41:38,282
[SPEAKER_16]: Galusi and your student's elementary school about results of your student's screen results and the presentation that will take place will be an excellent presentation and it's going to happen tomorrow, Wednesday,

53
00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:40,985
[SPEAKER_16]: Tomorrow's Tuesday, correct.

54
00:41:41,405 --> 00:41:44,967
[SPEAKER_16]: Wednesday, December 6th at 6.30 p.m.

55
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,928
[SPEAKER_16]: in the McGlynn School Library.

56
00:41:48,188 --> 00:41:53,851
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, this Wednesday, December 6th at the McGlynn School Library, it's on the second floor.

57
00:41:54,271 --> 00:42:00,495
[SPEAKER_16]: There will be an in-person presentation to really help families unpack the assessment.

58
00:42:00,915 --> 00:42:01,835
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you, Ms.

59
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,216
[SPEAKER_16]: Galussi, and thank you, Ms.

60
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:07,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Howell, for the presentation that you'll be doing this week.

61
00:42:08,607 --> 00:42:13,310
[SPEAKER_16]: And we just want you to know that administering the early the universal screening.

62
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:21,194
[SPEAKER_16]: It's crucial to promoting reading success for every child, and we value our partnership with you.

63
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:25,897
[SPEAKER_16]: Just on a side today I was in a McGlynn school kindergarten classroom.

64
00:42:26,697 --> 00:42:30,061
[SPEAKER_16]: And I got to see some students reading their early readers.

65
00:42:30,421 --> 00:42:31,462
[SPEAKER_16]: They were so excited.

66
00:42:31,942 --> 00:42:36,487
[SPEAKER_16]: I think I was more excited because I'm like, oh, it's only December 4th and you're reading.

67
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:39,650
[SPEAKER_16]: So our students are doing wonderful things.

68
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:45,915
[SPEAKER_16]: So have your little ones read to you at home and encourage early literacy and reading.

69
00:42:46,796 --> 00:43:03,001
[SPEAKER_16]: I also just want our listening audience to know that kindergarten registration, which is critically important for us to have accurate numbers of students that are going to be coming to Medford Public Schools next year, that kindergarten registration is going to begin next month.

70
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,542
[SPEAKER_16]: in January.

71
00:43:05,102 --> 00:43:13,631
[SPEAKER_16]: So we start in January and it continues for a few months, but if some of you remember, we did have a surprise this summer at the 11th hour.

72
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:25,001
[SPEAKER_16]: We had a lot of kindergarten students come and register and we were forced to open additional classrooms, you know, with a very, very short turnaround.

73
00:43:25,582 --> 00:43:27,964
[SPEAKER_16]: So please be on the lookout for those,

74
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:36,139
[SPEAKER_16]: kindergarten registration opportunities and we will be providing child care and interpretation services.

75
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,786
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, the first event will be taking place on January 16.

76
00:43:43,183 --> 00:43:50,785
[SPEAKER_16]: There are a few important upcoming events that are going to be happening district-wide.

77
00:43:51,326 --> 00:44:02,649
[SPEAKER_16]: On December 5th, which is tomorrow, there is a financial planning webinar with the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority at 7 o'clock on Zoom.

78
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:10,817
[SPEAKER_16]: please go to the Medford High School website, or you can contact Stacey Shulman for additional information.

79
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:25,312
[SPEAKER_16]: So for juniors, for seniors, parents who wanna find out information, and possibly if you have even a freshman or a sophomore, and you're an early planner, take advantage of this college financial planning webinar.

80
00:44:26,874 --> 00:44:35,861
[SPEAKER_16]: December 7, as I said earlier, it will mark the first night of Hanukkah, so happy Hanukkah to our Jewish friends, families, and neighbors.

81
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:41,466
[SPEAKER_16]: December 13 and 14, our wonderful band once again

82
00:44:43,078 --> 00:44:49,282
[SPEAKER_16]: and our orchestra holiday concerts are gonna be taking place at Medford High School at 7 p.m.

83
00:44:49,582 --> 00:44:58,368
[SPEAKER_16]: Save the date, mark your calendars, charge your telephones, get ready to take nice pictures and video, record them as well.

84
00:44:58,828 --> 00:45:01,610
[SPEAKER_16]: So December 13th and 14th, save those dates.

85
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:06,913
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm gonna just share with you a quick overview of what's gonna happen this evening.

86
00:45:07,553 --> 00:45:08,054
[SPEAKER_16]: Tonight,

87
00:45:09,136 --> 00:45:13,881
[SPEAKER_16]: in addition to welcoming and recognizing our wonderful band and color guard students.

88
00:45:15,302 --> 00:45:27,174
[SPEAKER_16]: We're also going to hear a wonderful presentation from the Missittuck Elementary School today by Principal Kathleen Kaye, and she's here with her assistant principal, Ms.

89
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:28,215

[SPEAKER_16]: So we look forward to hearing both of your presentations this evening.

00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:52,135
[SPEAKER_16]: We're also gonna hear a presentation this evening by Ms.

97
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:04,004
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's our, again, in-district assessment.

98
00:46:05,504 --> 00:46:12,668
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanna just go now and recognize, because we're getting ready to tee up for our wonderful band members and color guard.

99
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:25,694
[SPEAKER_16]: Last month, our Mustangs placed not third, not second, but first place at the NESBA finals.

100
00:46:25,734 --> 00:46:27,515
[SPEAKER_16]: Can we give them a round of applause?

101
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:30,760
[SPEAKER_17]: We're so proud of you.

102
00:46:38,953 --> 00:46:40,793
[SPEAKER_16]: They received a platinum medal.

103
00:46:41,574 --> 00:46:55,717
[SPEAKER_16]: And in addition to being the New England Division II champs, they also took home an award for best music, best visual, best overall effect, and best color guard.

104
00:46:56,277 --> 00:46:59,838
[SPEAKER_16]: This is a first in Medford band history.

105
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:07,240
[SPEAKER_16]: And as a community, we're so proud to celebrate these exemplary Mustang musicians and performers.

106
00:47:07,581 --> 00:47:09,339
[SPEAKER_16]: Can we give them one more round of applause?

107
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:34,132
[SPEAKER_16]: So, in recognition of this huge accomplishment, we're very pleased to present each of our students with a certificate on behalf of the entire Mustang community.

108
00:47:34,812 --> 00:47:36,093

[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you to all of you.

113
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:09,236
[SPEAKER_16]: At this time, I'd like to present with Mayor Wendell Kern, each student with their certificate, and then we'll figure out a way to take a photo

114
00:48:09,776 --> 00:48:11,597
[SPEAKER_16]: with the entire school committee.

115
00:48:12,197 --> 00:48:22,499
[SPEAKER_16]: So please hold your applause if you can until all the names have been read, because I do believe we have 48 wonderful students to recognize.

00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:38,584
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize.

[SPEAKER_03]: just to go down, or let them go?

[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's microphones, so.

120
00:48:48,777 --> 00:48:49,497

[SPEAKER_06]: Tall people in the back.

198
00:59:17,862 --> 00:59:20,024

00:59:44,325 --> 00:59:46,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why it's off of the microphone.

200
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:24,710
Yeah.

201
01:04:03,629 --> 01:04:10,815

01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,220
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for joining us.

204
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:23,644
[SPEAKER_07]: I know you'll probably be here tonight and on the 18th, so two meetings to get right in in January, right?

205
01:04:24,245 --> 01:04:24,585
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

206
01:04:25,025 --> 01:04:26,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure if we have any student representatives.

207
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:27,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Dr. Cushing?

208
01:04:28,548 --> 01:04:28,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Not yet.

209
01:04:29,069 --> 01:04:29,429
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know.

210
01:04:29,569 --> 01:04:29,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

211
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:31,731
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just wanted to say hello if we did.

212
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:32,851
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

213
01:04:34,016 --> 01:04:39,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up, we have number three, Misatoch Elementary School and Andrews Middle School updates.

214
01:04:39,437 --> 01:04:39,637
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

215
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:42,377
[SPEAKER_13]: We skipped over item five, the consent agenda.

216
01:04:42,397 --> 01:04:45,178
[SPEAKER_13]: It was on the front page.

217
01:04:46,538 --> 01:04:46,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, jeez.

218
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:49,559
[SPEAKER_07]: My apologies.

219
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:54,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Revert back to the regular order of business to consent agenda.

220
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:59,180
[SPEAKER_07]: We have bills and payrolls and regular school committee meeting minutes from November 20th, 2023.

221
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion for approval of the consent agenda?

222
01:05:04,895 --> 01:05:07,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kreatz.

223
01:05:07,676 --> 01:05:08,517
[SPEAKER_07]: All those in favor?

224
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:09,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

225
01:05:09,517 --> 01:05:10,498
[SPEAKER_07]: All those opposed?

226
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,119
[SPEAKER_07]: Consent agenda is approved.

227
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:17,662
[SPEAKER_07]: Now to number three under report of superintendent.

228
01:05:17,762 --> 01:05:22,244
[SPEAKER_07]: It's number, the Missittuck Elementary School and Andrews Middle School updates.

229
01:05:22,284 --> 01:05:23,525
[SPEAKER_07]: We have Ms.

230
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:26,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Kathy Kay, Missittuck principal, and Ms.

231
01:05:26,146 --> 01:05:29,228
[SPEAKER_07]: Jennifer Skane, Andrews Middle School principal.

232
01:05:29,548 --> 01:05:29,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome.

233
01:05:30,408 --> 01:05:33,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on up one at a time or both together depending on how you have it planned.

234
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,519
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, Missituk is first.

235
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,700
[SPEAKER_16]: And Ms.

236
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,981
[SPEAKER_16]: Sherman-Hudson, you're more than welcome to... She's here.

237
01:05:46,021 --> 01:05:47,261
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for being here tonight.

238
01:05:48,702 --> 01:06:05,546
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much for inviting me to show all the things that have happened at the Missituk and are planned to happen moving forward, none of which would be possible without the amazing PTO that the Missituk has, as well as the dedicated staff that work at the Missituk Elementary School.

239
01:06:05,987 --> 01:06:11,009
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of which is here, Mr. Sherman Hudson, who is my right and left hand, sometimes my toes when needed.

240
01:06:11,669 --> 01:06:13,970
[SPEAKER_01]: And also David Nguyen came with me.

241
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:17,991
[SPEAKER_01]: He is on the Mississippi School Council, so he's going to support tonight.

242
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:21,112
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you so much, and I hope you like what you see.

243
01:06:22,093 --> 01:06:24,033
[SPEAKER_01]: There's our school, and here's what's happening.

244
01:06:24,854 --> 01:06:29,655
[SPEAKER_01]: So we always start the year off with our kickboard and playground.

245
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:34,797
[SPEAKER_03]: And on August 22nd, the kids are getting out there, and usually they're never

246
01:06:37,177 --> 01:06:38,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Our ETO runs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

247
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:45,443
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that?

248
01:06:45,703 --> 01:06:45,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

249
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:51,966
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so they get to meet one another once again, just to kind of get reacquainted and have some fun on the playground.

250
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:57,129
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you're going to hear me say Missittuck PTO quite a lot because they really help us in amazing ways.

251
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:03,432
[SPEAKER_01]: One exciting thing we did at the Missittuck last spring was we did a pilot screening program.

252
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:06,494
[SPEAKER_01]: So the students who had registered for kindergarten

253
01:07:07,354 --> 01:07:09,256
[SPEAKER_01]: came in and they were able to meet with teachers.

254
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:12,119
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to do that screening before school began.

255
01:07:12,579 --> 01:07:14,421
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really did help us with placement.

256
01:07:14,461 --> 01:07:18,384
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many days that Mr. Sherman Hudson and I say, wow, we're really glad we did this.

257
01:07:18,424 --> 01:07:22,348
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would strongly recommend if we could do it moving forward, two thumbs up.

258
01:07:23,747 --> 01:07:30,409
[SPEAKER_01]: The next event we did on September 8, and this is where normally we do it in the gym, but it was a really, really hot day.

259
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:40,873
[SPEAKER_01]: So we went out onto the playground, the whole entire school, kindergarten through fifth grade, and the teachers circled around the students out on our blacktop area.

260
01:07:41,293 --> 01:07:47,495
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what the teachers do, because I want the students to know everybody in the building, and so they introduced the person to their left.

261
01:07:48,115 --> 01:07:51,237
[SPEAKER_01]: So that teacher then has to kind of say hello and get acquainted again.

262
01:07:51,257 --> 01:07:53,399
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've already done that because it was September 8th.

263
01:07:53,799 --> 01:07:58,142
[SPEAKER_01]: But they tell something nice about that person to the whole student body.

264
01:07:58,382 --> 01:07:59,923
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as you can see, they're laughing.

265
01:08:00,103 --> 01:08:00,784
[SPEAKER_01]: They were having a good time.

266
01:08:01,424 --> 01:08:05,167
[SPEAKER_01]: We passed around a megaphone and hardly anyone wanted to use it.

267
01:08:05,327 --> 01:08:07,908
[SPEAKER_01]: So there were teachers who didn't need it, but there were some who did.

268
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:14,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Then in September, the PTO helps us organize our Ice Cream Social.

269
01:08:14,693 --> 01:08:16,154
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the PTO Ice Cream Social.

270
01:08:16,744 --> 01:08:25,547
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see, we have, well, when the slide changes, hopefully soon, you can see that they have parents who help serve ice cream.

271
01:08:25,627 --> 01:08:29,169
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of our students who went to the Mississippi come back almost every year.

272
01:08:30,089 --> 01:08:32,470
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of urge them, you can have free ice cream if you come as well.

273
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:34,291
[SPEAKER_01]: So that usually works out well.

274
01:08:34,691 --> 01:08:35,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can see they're having fun.

275
01:08:35,891 --> 01:08:39,733
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was me in the middle, I took a selfie with some of the kids with my big, huge camera.

276
01:08:39,753 --> 01:08:40,633
[SPEAKER_01]: So they got a kick out of that.

277
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:43,414
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the PTO sets up where they can do like a photo booth.

278
01:08:43,814 --> 01:08:45,195
[SPEAKER_01]: So I usually have a lot of fun there as well.

279
01:08:46,345 --> 01:08:50,046
[SPEAKER_01]: The next event that took place was on October 4, we do two a year.

280
01:08:50,466 --> 01:08:53,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do believe a lot of the other schools participate in this as well.

281
01:08:54,467 --> 01:08:56,928
[SPEAKER_01]: In October, it's a national walk, ride to school day.

282
01:08:56,948 --> 01:08:59,948
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the PTO gets really involved.

283
01:09:00,408 --> 01:09:06,850
[SPEAKER_01]: They what we do to get all the students involved who want to be is I go around the corner, and I meet the kids on the bus.

284
01:09:08,015 --> 01:09:24,052
[SPEAKER_01]: They get off the bus and then they walk up the street we have parent volunteers to make sure everyone's safe to have a little bit of a walk and then what the PTO does is they write, but you can see, I'm going to say it wrong I'm sure Wayne trabajo on the ground in Spanish and Portuguese to kind of welcome those kids into, you know,

285
01:09:24,432 --> 01:09:26,093
[SPEAKER_01]: celebrating our diversity at our school.

286
01:09:26,633 --> 01:09:32,415
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the PTO waits at the school, and they kind of have the kids sign in their name and their teacher's name.

287
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:37,976
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what they do is they decide, well, they count up, and by the end of the day, they let me know which class had the most participants.

288
01:09:38,296 --> 01:09:43,778
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get the Golden Shoe Award, which you can see is one of the child's old sneakers that they just painted gold.

289
01:09:44,258 --> 01:09:45,839
[SPEAKER_01]: But the kids really like it.

290
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:49,240
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mrs. Schrammowitz's class, fourth grade, they were the winners this year.

291
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,240
[SPEAKER_01]: So I took a picture of them.

292
01:09:51,847 --> 01:09:56,152
[SPEAKER_01]: In October, we did a story night and a PTO book fair.

293
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:58,234
[SPEAKER_01]: This one was by Scholastic.

294
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:04,441
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see the amount of the total sales that we made quite a lot, over $9,000, almost 10.

295
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:08,044
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of that money comes back to us in Scholastic dollars.

296
01:10:08,105 --> 01:10:11,608
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes the PTO will buy rugs or

297
01:10:12,749 --> 01:10:16,533
[SPEAKER_01]: the movable chairs or even just books for the library, using those PTO dollars.

298
01:10:17,014 --> 01:10:31,148
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the same evening we had teachers, high school students, Mrs. Ingrid Moncada, who was here before, and we read stories to the children who came to our rooms in English, Portuguese, Haitian, Creole, and Spanish.

299
01:10:34,312 --> 01:10:52,962
[SPEAKER_01]: The next event we had was on October 25, and this was a pilot program at our school that was brought to me by Hendrick Gideons, and he visited with me over the summer, and we planned it out where he's doing this not-for-profit organization called Down by the Riverside, and the email address is there if anybody wants to check it out.

300
01:10:53,763 --> 01:10:59,626
[SPEAKER_01]: And he has partnered up with Willie J. Laws, who is a black veteran

301
01:11:00,266 --> 01:11:02,150
[SPEAKER_01]: and he's a lifetime blues musician.

302
01:11:02,431 --> 01:11:08,142
[SPEAKER_01]: He grew up in Texas and he tours all over the nation, but he has settled here in Massachusetts.

303
01:11:09,093 --> 01:11:16,560
[SPEAKER_01]: What he did was with Mr. Gideons, they gave two 45 minute sessions so the entire school was able to participate.

304
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:22,807
[SPEAKER_01]: They focused on using music as a way to create connections between people and our communities.

305
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:31,635
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Mr. Laws also shared his own experiences at being a master performer in an intimate setting within our school and Mr. Gideons also sent me a

306
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:41,021
[SPEAKER_01]: link of some of that program but it was four minutes long and it also came today so I shared with Dr. Edward Vincent if she wants to share it with you then you can take a look at that.

307
01:11:42,482 --> 01:11:48,105
[SPEAKER_01]: In October, many of you are already aware, I usually invite you every year to come to the school to read to the classes.

308
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:50,095
[SPEAKER_01]: for Jumpstart Read for the Record.

309
01:11:50,376 --> 01:11:52,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been looking daily to see if the record has been broken yet.

310
01:11:52,996 --> 01:11:56,597
[SPEAKER_01]: They're giving me lots of other email, but I haven't found out yet.

311
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:00,559
[SPEAKER_01]: It's become such a big organization that I don't know that we break the record anymore.

312
01:12:01,759 --> 01:12:08,241
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a lot of fun because the community members come in and they read to our lower students, and then the upper students read to the kids in the middle grades.

313
01:12:08,561 --> 01:12:11,042
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I run around like a crazy person and I take pictures.

314
01:12:11,422 --> 01:12:15,043
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see some of the famous people who participated this year.

315
01:12:15,163 --> 01:12:18,284
[SPEAKER_01]: And the book was With Lots of Love by Jenny Sanchez Torres.

316
01:12:18,795 --> 01:12:20,256
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the kids really enjoyed it.

317
01:12:20,276 --> 01:12:22,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for everyone who volunteered their time.

318
01:12:22,477 --> 01:12:25,498
[SPEAKER_01]: And to those of you who couldn't, I understand, busy lives.

319
01:12:26,859 --> 01:12:35,223
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things that I've been doing for the past 12 years, because this is my 12th year at the Mississippi slash Columbus Elementary School, we do weekly awards.

320
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,684
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them works of wonder.

321
01:12:37,544 --> 01:12:41,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I no longer post them as www because I got an email from a company in

322
01:12:42,366 --> 01:12:43,867
[SPEAKER_01]: England who said that that was trademarked.

323
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,168
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I called it works of wonder we were good to go.

324
01:12:46,348 --> 01:12:47,209
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we do.

325
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:56,834
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically what happens is every week, Mrs. Sherman Hudson and I run around, the teachers submit something wonderful that a child has done, and they just go, well, that was really good.

326
01:12:57,294 --> 01:13:00,736
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we give them a certificate, we give them a crazy little handshake and a pencil.

327
01:13:01,471 --> 01:13:02,211
[SPEAKER_01]: And the kids smile.

328
01:13:02,372 --> 01:13:04,153
[SPEAKER_01]: They really, really smile from ear to ear.

329
01:13:04,633 --> 01:13:07,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they'll say, wow, this is my fifth one.

330
01:13:07,475 --> 01:13:09,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just so excited and proud to get it.

331
01:13:09,236 --> 01:13:10,236
[SPEAKER_01]: It hangs on the refrigerator.

332
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:12,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do give them to staff and community members as well.

333
01:13:12,778 --> 01:13:14,799
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may have been on the receiving end of those.

334
01:13:14,839 --> 01:13:17,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you have, thank you for whatever you've done for the Mississippi.

335
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:20,962
[SPEAKER_01]: We also do a monthly called Conduct and Citizenship.

336
01:13:21,483 --> 01:13:22,864
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are for the students who

337
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:32,211
[SPEAKER_01]: stand out just a little bit further by being responsible, respectful, and safe, following the school rules as often as they can throughout the month.

338
01:13:32,731 --> 01:13:37,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the teacher submits one child, so there are 10 winners a year, and they get things like a ribbon.

339
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:39,481
[SPEAKER_01]: They get to cut the lunch line if they're getting school lunch.

340
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,463
[SPEAKER_01]: They sit on the stage with myself and some friends.

341
01:13:42,503 --> 01:13:43,243
[SPEAKER_01]: We play games.

342
01:13:43,363 --> 01:13:44,104
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to know them.

343
01:13:44,805 --> 01:13:45,726
[SPEAKER_01]: And I take a picture.

344
01:13:45,786 --> 01:13:46,927
[SPEAKER_01]: I post it to the website.

345
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:49,850
[SPEAKER_01]: And they get to help us pick the next Spirit Day.

346
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:51,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of takes a little bit of the pressure off me.

347
01:13:51,752 --> 01:13:53,113
[SPEAKER_01]: Nancy and I count the votes.

348
01:13:53,794 --> 01:13:54,875
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's going to be Pajama Day.

349
01:13:54,895 --> 01:13:56,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who wants to participate, it's the end of December.

350
01:13:58,229 --> 01:14:05,594
[SPEAKER_01]: This year for the first time, which I do have to admit I heard at another school's meeting, we did PTO trunk and treat.

351
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:13,479
[SPEAKER_01]: And what the PTO did was they invited family members to decorate their cars and their trunks and dress up in costumes and offer candy to the kids.

352
01:14:13,979 --> 01:14:19,903
[SPEAKER_01]: And over 200 people came from the Missittuck and the greater community to trick or treat in the Missittuck parking lot.

353
01:14:20,063 --> 01:14:21,504
[SPEAKER_01]: And the kids had a great time.

354
01:14:23,134 --> 01:14:30,264
[SPEAKER_01]: The PTO also supports cultural events every year with the amazing help of Mrs. Christina McGordy.

355
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:32,447
[SPEAKER_01]: She pretty much organizes this for everybody.

356
01:14:32,528 --> 01:14:38,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you can see on the list of events, every grade has at least one that has come in.

357
01:14:39,126 --> 01:14:42,707
[SPEAKER_01]: The Afro-Brazilian martial arts, music, and dance came for the whole school.

358
01:14:43,207 --> 01:14:44,607
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did two sessions again.

359
01:14:44,707 --> 01:14:49,928
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really glad that they did not ask me to come up on stage and try that with them, as you can see in the picture.

360
01:14:50,648 --> 01:14:51,729
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't have been able to do that.

361
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:57,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Curious Creatures came in not that long ago on the 17th of November for kindergarten.

362
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:01,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the picture, you can see that Jabari has a snake around his neck.

363
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:02,071
[SPEAKER_01]: That's real.

364
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:04,451
[SPEAKER_01]: They passed around it, well,

365
01:15:04,923 --> 01:15:05,784
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't pass around.

366
01:15:05,924 --> 01:15:09,028
[SPEAKER_01]: The person from Curious Creatures held the animals.

367
01:15:09,689 --> 01:15:11,011
[SPEAKER_01]: But the kids were able to touch a turtle.

368
01:15:11,391 --> 01:15:13,554
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a ferret that Jack has in his hand.

369
01:15:13,934 --> 01:15:17,218
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the left corner, you can kind of see that's not the turtle's head.

370
01:15:17,659 --> 01:15:20,262
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a bearded dragon she put on the turtle's back.

371
01:15:20,763 --> 01:15:23,867
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wouldn't stay on, but it kind of made a pretty cool picture, I thought.

372
01:15:25,883 --> 01:15:28,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Right before Thanksgiving, two of our classes, Ms.

373
01:15:28,225 --> 01:15:28,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Changelian and Ms.

374
01:15:28,965 --> 01:15:32,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Penta, they did a famsgiving celebration.

375
01:15:32,688 --> 01:15:40,473
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they invited the parents to come in, or grandparents, whoever could come, with their own food so we didn't have to worry about any allergies or anything like that.

376
01:15:40,854 --> 01:15:45,237
[SPEAKER_01]: They sat down at a really big table and they just shared their snack and then just celebrated.

377
01:15:45,257 --> 01:15:49,780
[SPEAKER_01]: The kids made placemats for their parents and told what they were thankful for and it was really a sweet, sweet event.

378
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:56,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the Mississauga PTO sponsors so many things at our school, and here's a list of some of them.

379
01:15:57,092 --> 01:15:59,973
[SPEAKER_01]: Book fairs, we've already had one, there'll be another one, Porter Square.

380
01:16:00,534 --> 01:16:11,498
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, for the first time, we are doing closed caption in our PTO virtual meetings, and they've chosen, you can only do one language, so they've chosen Portuguese, because that tends to be the largest population of speakers in our school.

381
01:16:12,182 --> 01:16:13,643
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of the others are listed.

382
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:16,984
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have our Village Craft Fair this Saturday, which was wonderful.

383
01:16:17,344 --> 01:16:20,286
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to say I'm almost done with my Christmas shopping.

384
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:21,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to the PTO.

385
01:16:21,566 --> 01:16:22,867
[SPEAKER_01]: Once again, they helped me in my life.

386
01:16:24,027 --> 01:16:28,509
[SPEAKER_01]: The Who's Reading is always a wonderful event, and it's always very well-participated, so that's exciting, too.

387
01:16:28,589 --> 01:16:32,331
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, a lot of schools do Teach Appreciation Day or week.

388
01:16:32,851 --> 01:16:35,252
[SPEAKER_01]: PTO does a month, so that's pretty spectacular.

389
01:16:36,684 --> 01:16:39,629
[SPEAKER_01]: The BTO also helps fund field trips that we go on.

390
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:44,215
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just listed for you some of the places that the school will be going on.

391
01:16:44,296 --> 01:16:47,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they help pay for at least one trip for every grade level.

392
01:16:47,921 --> 01:16:49,664
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll see that everyone's represented there.

393
01:16:52,352 --> 01:16:56,637
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, the district is offering us many training opportunities this year.

394
01:16:56,657 --> 01:17:10,613
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you'll see the list, bullying, Hill for Literacy, EPRI training, HMH, that's our new reading program, literacy coaching, data analysis with the help of Mr. Paul DeLiva, which I'm so happy he's housed in my building, the science of reading, and then ST Math.

395
01:17:11,843 --> 01:17:14,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And so on the next page, I just thought it might be fun to see a picture of Gigi.

396
01:17:15,684 --> 01:17:18,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Mrs. Cara Bates is going to be our ST Math champion.

397
01:17:18,965 --> 01:17:26,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So she's going to be creating a bulletin board in the library, because the kids go there all the time, so they can see their stats and how far they're going.

398
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:29,247
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a spatial temporal program.

399
01:17:29,767 --> 01:17:34,229
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helps the children use their reasoning to solve mathematical problems.

400
01:17:34,749 --> 01:17:35,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And they use it in class.

401
01:17:36,329 --> 01:17:37,471
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can use it at home.

402
01:17:37,671 --> 01:17:39,735
[SPEAKER_01]: And then last year, Gigi was supposed to come.

403
01:17:39,775 --> 01:17:41,457
[SPEAKER_01]: It was going to be a costume that I was going to put on.

404
01:17:41,838 --> 01:17:44,122
[SPEAKER_01]: So it didn't happen, but hopefully that'll happen this year.

405
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:49,951
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what we're going to try and do is get a little Gigi stuffed animal, and then the class who has them, so we can kind of pass that around, like the sneaker.

406
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:53,168
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we have more events that are coming.

407
01:17:53,248 --> 01:17:57,071
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't happened yet, but we'll have our winter concert, which we always video record.

408
01:17:57,592 --> 01:17:59,653
[SPEAKER_01]: This year at the Missittuck, we're going to try something new.

409
01:17:59,733 --> 01:18:04,057
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to call it a, I don't know, we might change the name, but basically it's a specialist showcase.

410
01:18:04,657 --> 01:18:12,303
[SPEAKER_01]: So the gym teacher will be there, the art teacher, the music teacher, the Nexus teacher, and the librarian.

411
01:18:12,323 --> 01:18:14,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm forgetting somebody.

412
01:18:15,005 --> 01:18:20,509
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll just kind of show the families some of the things that they may have done throughout the year that the children are learning in their classes.

413
01:18:20,549 --> 01:18:21,430
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will be in the spring.

414
01:18:22,432 --> 01:18:24,273
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be a spring walk bike to school.

415
01:18:24,473 --> 01:18:31,617
[SPEAKER_01]: We always have a fifth grade volleyball game, students versus the teachers and the students don't always win, but most of the time they do.

416
01:18:32,377 --> 01:18:38,841
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a fun day that again, the PTO helps really fund and support with their man, woman, person power.

417
01:18:39,461 --> 01:18:42,783
[SPEAKER_01]: And the PTO does an end of the year dance party, which is always a lot of fun for the kids.

418
01:18:42,803 --> 01:18:44,624
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you for listening.

419
01:18:45,184 --> 01:18:46,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And does anybody have any questions?

420
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:47,405
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

421
01:18:47,565 --> 01:18:49,106
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

422
01:18:49,126 --> 01:18:50,347
[SPEAKER_07]: We appreciate the presentation.

423
01:18:50,487 --> 01:18:50,687
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

424
01:18:58,081 --> 01:19:00,143
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

425
01:19:00,243 --> 01:19:00,943
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening.

426
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:07,168
[SPEAKER_12]: If I put these on I can see you, but I can't see this.

427
01:19:07,268 --> 01:19:07,848
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.

428
01:19:07,888 --> 01:19:08,449
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

429
01:19:09,409 --> 01:19:15,394
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's kind of fitting that I'm here this evening because today is actually my 90th work day in the district.

430
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:34,061
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm pleased to say that it has been an amazing, rewarding experience getting to know all of the MedFit public school systems and students and families.

431
01:19:34,321 --> 01:19:41,270
[SPEAKER_12]: And I am eager to continue that work with staff and families in order to make a positive difference in the community.

432
01:19:44,597 --> 01:19:46,598
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just started out with some numbers.

433
01:19:47,718 --> 01:19:51,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Our current enrollment is about 455 students.

434
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:56,902
[SPEAKER_12]: We've seen a lot of students join us at the start of the school year, transferring to our school.

435
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:05,746
[SPEAKER_12]: And we've had some success in making sure that they transition successfully through support of our guidance program.

436
01:20:06,126 --> 01:20:09,348
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're looking to even start a student

437
01:20:10,066 --> 01:20:14,931
[SPEAKER_12]: mentor program where students can help mentor students that are starting at our school.

438
01:20:17,113 --> 01:20:20,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Our honor roll for this first quarter, it was pretty amazing.

439
01:20:20,556 --> 01:20:31,327
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you add up all that numbers and do the math, it's about 76% of our students made honor roll, either honors or high honors this particular quarter.

440
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:48,330
[SPEAKER_12]: Our teachers, we have 60 educators, either core educators, exploratory teachers, physical education, special education teachers, and then we have about 20 support staff.

441
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,271
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are our Councilors, et cetera.

442
01:20:50,751 --> 01:20:53,914
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have to say that I think I have one of the best staff in the district.

443
01:21:00,387 --> 01:21:03,369
[SPEAKER_12]: So in the classroom, we've been pretty active in the classroom.

444
01:21:10,234 --> 01:21:11,214
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I didn't do attendance.

445
01:21:11,274 --> 01:21:11,715
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry.

446
01:21:12,015 --> 01:21:13,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me just add that we do have 95.4.

447
01:21:13,596 --> 01:21:16,158
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm ready to get that up over that 95 so I can highlight up to 96.

448
01:21:22,247 --> 01:21:22,927
[SPEAKER_12]: That's my goal.

449
01:21:22,967 --> 01:21:28,408
[SPEAKER_12]: I would like to get 96% attendance by the end of the school year and then maybe even increase that next year.

450
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:28,828
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

451
01:21:29,568 --> 01:21:38,030
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so yes, uh, attendance and, um, very excited to say at least 133 students had perfect attendance.

452
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:39,950
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty amazing.

453
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:49,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so in the classroom, um, our students have been working pretty hard at learning some new skills, taking the skills they've already learned,

454
01:21:49,781 --> 01:21:53,943
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just highlighted a few of the things that we have done in 7B.

455
01:21:54,563 --> 01:22:02,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Our students in our social studies curriculum did a compare and contrast essay in Ms.

456
01:22:02,587 --> 01:22:18,094
[SPEAKER_12]: O'Donohue's class, and they had to take countries' literacy skills and different points of research for different countries, and then they had to compare and contrast

457
01:22:18,775 --> 01:22:21,557
[SPEAKER_12]: And they did this over a multi-unit lesson.

458
01:22:22,077 --> 01:22:27,600
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the students were actually able to post their lessons in one of the bulletin boards in the main lobby.

459
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:35,024
[SPEAKER_12]: And students could select, if they wanted to, to identify themselves to their colleagues and other students.

460
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:41,107
[SPEAKER_12]: So many of the students did choose to put their names on their paper and identify their hard work.

461
01:22:41,147 --> 01:22:42,368
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was pretty exciting.

462
01:22:42,928 --> 01:22:46,370
[SPEAKER_12]: For Veterans Day, our students in Mr. Tremonti's class

463
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:50,010
[SPEAKER_12]: worked on the entire school all week.

464
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:59,051
[SPEAKER_12]: We had done some what does Veterans Day mean and try and highlight the different aspects of what Veterans Day incorporates.

465
01:22:59,591 --> 01:23:09,993
[SPEAKER_12]: And then one of the culminating was that students were invited through Operation Gratitude to write letters to veterans members and current members serving in the military.

466
01:23:10,013 --> 01:23:15,594
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm pleased to say we sent out 98 letters that will be sent off to current

467
01:23:17,156 --> 01:23:25,340
[SPEAKER_12]: military members, and we also, students decided to make some poppies and decorated one of the boards in the main lobby.

468
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:31,744
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are there highlighting some of our current staff members, family members who are also veterans.

469
01:23:31,804 --> 01:23:32,785
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty nice.

470
01:23:34,145 --> 01:23:40,529
[SPEAKER_12]: We also, I know Kathy mentioned ST Math, so we're pretty excited that

471
01:23:41,352 --> 01:24:07,584
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a grant that is allowing for 75 math licenses for our eighth grade students, and the district is gonna pick up the additional so that all of our eighth grade students can use ST Math, which is a conceptual math program where students will be able to use that to not only build in some remediation skills, but also enrichment if they are ready to extend their learning.

472
01:24:11,389 --> 01:24:12,249
[SPEAKER_12]: What else we got?

473
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:13,571
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all too little.

474
01:24:18,355 --> 01:24:23,300
[SPEAKER_12]: So the pictures on the right are our Global Scholars Program.

475
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:27,884
[SPEAKER_12]: So Global Scholars is an opportunity for our 7th grade

476
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:33,932
[SPEAKER_12]: civic students to have the opportunity to work with students from all over the world.

477
01:24:34,472 --> 01:24:46,857
[SPEAKER_12]: They decide on a topic of interest and then they work with students about how they might solve that problem, utilizing different cultures and different techniques from all over the world.

478
01:24:46,937 --> 01:24:53,679
[SPEAKER_12]: So they may be on a Zoom conference with students in Spain or, you know,

479
01:24:54,443 --> 01:25:13,949
[SPEAKER_12]: another country, and then the woman, Natalie Boyo, from the wildlife came in and spoke to our students, and they went out on a walk, and they looked at the Mystic River watershed, and they're incorporating that into their problem that they're solving this year, so that's pretty exciting as well.

480
01:25:13,969 --> 01:25:16,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Next slide.

481
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:32,715
[SPEAKER_12]: So when I started at the Andrews, I met with parents, I met with staff members, I met with families, I met with students, and I also met with other administrators from across the district.

482
01:25:33,316 --> 01:25:45,162
[SPEAKER_12]: Two things that were highly encouraged for me was to build fun and enrichment opportunities for the students and also increase communication.

483
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:59,946
[SPEAKER_12]: So two of the things that I have done is we have a weekly newsletter that we post and I send to all families on Friday evening, just kind of highlighting what the students are doing or what's coming up for them.

484
01:26:01,026 --> 01:26:07,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, you know, we put in there all of our PTO events because we have a very strong PTO.

485
01:26:09,069 --> 01:26:12,731
[SPEAKER_12]: The PTO, I feel like I lost a page here.

486
01:26:12,931 --> 01:26:16,513
[SPEAKER_12]: The PTO has had several successful events so far this year.

487
01:26:16,533 --> 01:26:23,818
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a pie fundraiser, which I have to say I got the chocolate intensity pie for Thanksgiving.

488
01:26:24,098 --> 01:26:25,539
[SPEAKER_12]: It was to die for.

489
01:26:26,379 --> 01:26:33,043
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're doing a gut sneakers fundraiser and a donation campaign.

490
01:26:34,423 --> 01:26:46,787
[SPEAKER_12]: also had an opportunity to host a family night where Kevin, a gentleman who runs lots of families, we played family feud, and we played bingo, and the kids had a lot of fun.

491
01:26:47,847 --> 01:26:50,107
[SPEAKER_12]: And I lost but that's okay.

492
01:26:51,448 --> 01:26:57,450
[SPEAKER_12]: So and then tonight we had a restaurant night at the Ford Tavern and we have one tomorrow night too.

493
01:26:57,930 --> 01:27:02,511
[SPEAKER_12]: And obviously all of these events are to raise funds to help support some of the

494
01:27:03,455 --> 01:27:12,180
[SPEAKER_12]: enrichment opportunities, as well as the other thing that I was asked to bring back, which is field trips and dances.

495
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:18,103
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've already had, I feel like I missed something here.

496
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:22,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

497
01:27:22,892 --> 01:27:34,801
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so and then we had curriculum night at the start of the year, which we invited students to come and help serve as leaders for the school so that they would help show the parents around the school.

498
01:27:35,221 --> 01:27:38,103
[SPEAKER_12]: The students really enjoyed that opportunity to step up.

499
01:27:38,183 --> 01:27:42,466
[SPEAKER_12]: They showed their pride in their school to their families as well.

500
01:27:42,506 --> 01:27:43,367
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was really fun.

501
01:27:43,942 --> 01:27:54,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of the pictures you see here, the item on the bottom was that we decided that we would ask people to bring their desserts to family night, and we asked them to bring something from their culture.

502
01:27:55,649 --> 01:28:05,916
[SPEAKER_12]: So we got to try lots of different cultural desserts that evening, and I had some Brazilian chocolate balls, which I have to say, I asked her if I could have some for Christmas.

503
01:28:06,376 --> 01:28:06,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Next slide.

504
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:27,175
[SPEAKER_12]: So student activities, we are very lucky to say that we have had such a high turnout for students that want to be involved in our student activities, that at the start of the year, with several of our advisors, I had to do some planning with them.

505
01:28:27,255 --> 01:28:30,076
[SPEAKER_12]: How would we fit all those students safely?

506
01:28:30,496 --> 01:28:40,020
[SPEAKER_12]: Volleyball, we had about 120 students turn out, and we were like, we can't do that in one particular afternoon, so we had to do it by grade every other week.

507
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:50,926
[SPEAKER_12]: We've just had a new staff member start at our school, so I'm pleased to say that we're going to have our own Andrews Middle School GSA club that starts next week.

508
01:28:51,146 --> 01:28:56,089
[SPEAKER_12]: We have had an extremely successful CCSR so far.

509
01:28:56,149 --> 01:28:58,791
[SPEAKER_12]: We have over 60 kids in the CCSR club.

510
01:28:59,471 --> 01:29:08,697
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have done two very successful programs under the direction of Melanie North and Marissa Isbell.

511
01:29:09,369 --> 01:29:15,655
[SPEAKER_12]: And the first one is that they raised over $300 in October by painting faces for students.

512
01:29:15,675 --> 01:29:20,540
[SPEAKER_12]: The students loved it, and the monies were sent for breast cancer research.

513
01:29:21,061 --> 01:29:30,931
[SPEAKER_12]: And the second was we had an extremely successful Thanksgiving food drive, which allowed us to make 36 baskets for families.

514
01:29:31,511 --> 01:29:45,237
[SPEAKER_12]: that the baskets are a huge laundry basket filled with everything you might have imagined, plus money, a gift card for a turkey, and all the fixings, and the paper plates, and all the goods.

515
01:29:45,438 --> 01:29:49,560
[SPEAKER_12]: And we had so many that we were able to reach out to the McGlynn Middle School.

516
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,922
[SPEAKER_12]: We supported students and families from the Andrews Middle School.

517
01:29:54,362 --> 01:29:57,603
[SPEAKER_12]: We sent some to the senior center and also to the

518
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:02,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Community Frigerator, is that what it's called?

519
01:30:03,094 --> 01:30:04,396
[SPEAKER_12]: The Community Frigerator?

520
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:10,102
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was a very successful day, very active day at the school.

521
01:30:11,084 --> 01:30:15,930
[SPEAKER_12]: So student life, that was the next thing that I was asked to kind of take a peek at.

522
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:17,752
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you switch the slide for me?

523
01:30:18,382 --> 01:30:26,692
[SPEAKER_12]: So we had our first spirit week in October, which started with pajama day I have to say that was my favorite day of the year to wear pajamas to work.

524
01:30:27,553 --> 01:30:34,402
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I dressed up with the kids and I was weird Barbie which I had never even known about until that particular day.

525
01:30:36,907 --> 01:30:39,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, no, no, no, no, we don't share those.

526
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:47,013
[SPEAKER_12]: So we and then we had a day where the students dress like the teachers and the teachers dress like the students.

527
01:30:47,073 --> 01:30:49,014
[SPEAKER_12]: That was quite entertaining.

528
01:30:49,534 --> 01:30:55,317
[SPEAKER_12]: And then showing your Mustang pride and showing your favorite team support.

529
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:58,759
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we did was we asked the teachers to take points.

530
01:30:59,406 --> 01:31:02,187
[SPEAKER_12]: and Tally, the most school spirit team.

531
01:31:02,327 --> 01:31:03,988
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was our 6B team.

532
01:31:04,048 --> 01:31:07,209
[SPEAKER_12]: So the day before Thanksgiving, you can see a picture of them.

533
01:31:07,249 --> 01:31:12,051
[SPEAKER_12]: We went down to the cafeteria and the PTO helped me purchase some pizza for those kids.

534
01:31:12,511 --> 01:31:17,133
[SPEAKER_12]: And they had a nice pizza lunch before they headed off for the Thanksgiving recess.

535
01:31:18,074 --> 01:31:22,795
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a pretty active and successful National Junior Honor Society.

536
01:31:23,356 --> 01:31:28,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Our students at the start of the year had to write their own speech, get up in front of their peers,

537
01:31:29,531 --> 01:31:42,560
[SPEAKER_12]: present their speeches and be elected to office for the NGHS, which I think is pretty difficult to do as a middle school student and was super proud of them.

538
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:46,423
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have three field trips already planned.

539
01:31:46,503 --> 01:31:54,469
[SPEAKER_12]: So next, on December 20th, the sixth grade is going to see the Lightning Thief at the Stonem Theater.

540
01:31:55,416 --> 01:32:00,260
[SPEAKER_12]: In the spring, the 7th grade is going to see a Wrinkle in Time at the Wheelock Theater.

541
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:07,425
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the 8th grade, we'll go to Canobie Lake and have a little bit of fun before they head off to the high school.

542
01:32:08,366 --> 01:32:16,352
[SPEAKER_12]: We also had a 6th grade dance in October where all the students wore neon and there were neon bracelets and it was extremely successful.

543
01:32:16,952 --> 01:32:20,075
[SPEAKER_12]: This Friday night, Principal Tucci and I

544
01:32:21,431 --> 01:32:23,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Miss Lally and Miss Bruno will be at the McGlynn again.

545
01:32:23,993 --> 01:32:27,456
[SPEAKER_12]: We're going to have an eighth grade dance called Winter Wonderland.

546
01:32:28,017 --> 01:32:31,319
[SPEAKER_12]: And then in March, we're going to have the seventh grade dance.

547
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:36,264
[SPEAKER_12]: And we haven't thought about a theme yet, but I'm sure the PTO will come up with something wonderful.

548
01:32:37,465 --> 01:32:42,689
[SPEAKER_12]: So a couple of other things that we'll be doing in the upcoming weeks is during our wind block.

549
01:32:43,169 --> 01:32:49,695
[SPEAKER_12]: We have been fortunate that the Massachusetts Partnership for Youth

550
01:32:50,347 --> 01:32:58,812
[SPEAKER_12]: is going to be able to present us two different opportunities for students to have some educational time.

551
01:32:59,072 --> 01:33:03,975
[SPEAKER_12]: One is the January, the seventh grade will have a presentation on vaping.

552
01:33:04,435 --> 01:33:12,740
[SPEAKER_12]: And one is in February, the eighth grade will have an opportunity for kind of the dangers of social media.

553
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:17,423
[SPEAKER_12]: And unfortunately, something that they have to be aware of is sexting.

554
01:33:17,543 --> 01:33:18,924
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're going to talk about that

555
01:33:19,622 --> 01:33:22,344
[SPEAKER_12]: and the dangers that can come from that.

556
01:33:22,504 --> 01:33:32,470
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we also have had the opportunity to do start with hello and say something, which are both programs through the Sandy Hook Foundation.

557
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:36,492
[SPEAKER_12]: We did the I Decide survey and we had some staff train this year.

558
01:33:36,532 --> 01:33:42,175
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're looking at how we can implement if we have any students that need support through substance abuse.

559
01:33:42,335 --> 01:33:46,378
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're doing the SBIRT screening this December 13th.

560
01:33:46,458 --> 01:33:48,299
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's all coming up pretty quick too.

561
01:33:49,189 --> 01:33:57,393
[SPEAKER_12]: We had a staff meeting today and it was very nice for me to be able to say at 90 days, where are we going?

562
01:33:57,673 --> 01:34:01,135
[SPEAKER_12]: How will we, who do we want to be at the Andrews Middle School?

563
01:34:01,195 --> 01:34:08,579
[SPEAKER_12]: So we did some visioning and brainstorming and decided some of our next steps as a school and how we're gonna approach that together.

564
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:09,760
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty exciting.

565
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:12,321
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for having me.

566
01:34:12,381 --> 01:34:13,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anyone have any questions?

567
01:34:23,066 --> 01:34:24,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, all four of you, for being here.

568
01:34:24,727 --> 01:34:25,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy holidays.

569
01:34:26,249 --> 01:34:27,069
[SPEAKER_07]: All five of you, sorry.

570
01:34:28,350 --> 01:34:32,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Next up, we have the NWEA MAP presentation by Ms.

571
01:34:32,294 --> 01:34:43,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Suzanne Galussi, Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction, Mr. Paul DeLeva, Executive Director of Data and Reporting, and Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, Director of Professional Learning and Assessment.

572
01:34:43,883 --> 01:34:44,584
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome, thank you.

573
01:35:02,574 --> 01:35:02,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

574
01:35:02,815 --> 01:35:03,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to wait one minute.

575
01:35:04,959 --> 01:35:06,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it okay if I just wait one minute for.

576
01:35:33,148 --> 01:35:33,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, good evening.

577
01:35:36,509 --> 01:35:37,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

578
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:43,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to welcome Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli and Paul DeLava.

579
01:35:44,393 --> 01:35:46,334
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to do the bulk of the presentation.

580
01:35:47,754 --> 01:35:55,818
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have, I believe, joining us Faiza Khan, Director of Math, if at the end there are any questions for the Director of Math.

581
01:35:57,323 --> 01:36:00,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities, will be joining us shortly.

582
01:36:01,164 --> 01:36:09,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, Rocco Sieri, the Director of Science, I believe this is his soccer banquet.

583
01:36:09,406 --> 01:36:13,047
[SPEAKER_05]: I think he has his banquet this evening for the soccer team.

584
01:36:13,127 --> 01:36:15,287
[SPEAKER_05]: So he will not be here in attendance.

585
01:36:15,347 --> 01:36:17,188
[SPEAKER_05]: But we want to thank you very much for your time.

586
01:36:17,868 --> 01:36:21,749
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm going to pass this to Bernadette Riccobelli.

587
01:36:34,155 --> 01:36:34,635
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening.

588
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:35,736
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, everyone.

589
01:36:36,436 --> 01:36:39,078
[SPEAKER_11]: So nice to see you, and welcome to the newly elected members.

590
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:42,740
[SPEAKER_11]: It's wonderful to have you here with us.

591
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:46,022
[SPEAKER_11]: So tonight, we're presenting a little differently.

592
01:36:46,122 --> 01:36:57,688
[SPEAKER_11]: So I am going to be actually controlling the slide projection from here, because if the members had an opportunity to go through the presentation, you're going to see that there are links embedded in, and it takes you to specific data points.

593
01:36:58,048 --> 01:37:02,030
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're trying something a little bit new with this tonight, at least for me.

594
01:37:03,941 --> 01:37:07,523
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, Mr. Paul DeLeva is here with me.

595
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:15,166
[SPEAKER_11]: Several of us worked on analyzing the results of the latest MAP growth testing over the past month.

596
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:21,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Originally, we were slated to present to the committee on November 20th, and then that was delayed a little bit.

597
01:37:21,949 --> 01:37:29,493
[SPEAKER_11]: So we took another look, and another look, and another look, and even as late as Friday, we were making some adjustments.

598
01:37:30,765 --> 01:37:39,108
[SPEAKER_11]: So in terms of the agenda tonight for us, just a little adjustment here, we are going to be talking about the test itself.

599
01:37:39,188 --> 01:37:51,933
[SPEAKER_11]: So many of you are aware of what the test entails, the overview, but for those of you that are new and for people watching from home, we're going to provide some information on the test itself and its design.

600
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:53,962
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to take a look at some results.

601
01:37:54,363 --> 01:37:58,830
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to take a look at the data utilization, because that is what is important.

602
01:37:58,870 --> 01:38:00,652
[SPEAKER_11]: How do we use the data that is yielded?

603
01:38:01,233 --> 01:38:06,982
[SPEAKER_11]: And then lastly, there'll be some appendix information with more data that is available to you.

604
01:38:14,594 --> 01:38:16,996
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so let's first start with an overview of the test.

605
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:18,177
[SPEAKER_11]: So what is MAP growth?

606
01:38:18,337 --> 01:38:21,719
[SPEAKER_11]: So MAP stands for measures of academic progress.

607
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:26,662
[SPEAKER_11]: And it measures what students know regardless of what grade they're in.

608
01:38:27,683 --> 01:38:33,267
[SPEAKER_11]: It allows us as administrators and for teachers in the classroom to look at growth over time.

609
01:38:33,287 --> 01:38:34,668
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is really what's important.

610
01:38:34,688 --> 01:38:35,929
[SPEAKER_11]: We wanna see what their growth is.

611
01:38:37,072 --> 01:38:43,936
[SPEAKER_11]: It is computer adaptive, and what that means is that the questions change as the student answers the question.

612
01:38:44,536 --> 01:38:51,040
[SPEAKER_11]: So if a student answers a question correctly, the next question has a little bit more difficulty.

613
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:57,864
[SPEAKER_11]: And the opposite is true, if the student answers the question incorrectly, the next one is a little bit easier.

614
01:38:58,324 --> 01:39:02,206
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's important to note, unlike MCAS, this is adaptive.

615
01:39:03,075 --> 01:39:07,487
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's not the students in the classroom don't have the same questions.

616
01:39:08,069 --> 01:39:09,870
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, so that's a really important point.

617
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:18,573
[SPEAKER_11]: That really differentiates a lot of the other type of summative informative assessments that we use.

618
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:21,994
[SPEAKER_11]: And then what is a RIT score?

619
01:39:22,054 --> 01:39:23,415
[SPEAKER_11]: A RIT score is really important.

620
01:39:23,455 --> 01:39:27,296
[SPEAKER_11]: And in a couple of slides, I'm gonna go over what a norm RIT is.

621
01:39:27,316 --> 01:39:29,917
[SPEAKER_11]: So a RIT is a standard score.

622
01:39:29,937 --> 01:39:33,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, it reflects a student's academic knowledge, skills, and abilities.

623
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:35,039
[SPEAKER_11]: It's stable.

624
01:39:36,993 --> 01:39:39,376
[SPEAKER_11]: It's like marking height on a growth chart.

625
01:39:39,437 --> 01:39:42,200
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the typical way that it is described.

626
01:39:43,021 --> 01:39:47,327
[SPEAKER_11]: And it provides a student's percentile ranking and conditional growth percentile.

627
01:39:47,788 --> 01:39:51,633
[SPEAKER_11]: And it really can show how much the student has achieved in comparison with their peers.

628
01:39:55,049 --> 01:39:57,890
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a very widely used test.

629
01:39:58,330 --> 01:40:03,672
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're talking about over 16 million students are tested each year.

630
01:40:04,192 --> 01:40:10,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Over 9,000 school systems use the MAP growth system, nine state systems.

631
01:40:10,314 --> 01:40:11,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Massachusetts is not one of them.

632
01:40:12,275 --> 01:40:14,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Massachusetts leaves it up to individual districts.

633
01:40:14,936 --> 01:40:16,517
[SPEAKER_11]: Medford obviously has opted in.

634
01:40:17,837 --> 01:40:22,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Over 50,000 schools, and it is also given in 149 countries.

635
01:40:24,252 --> 01:40:27,113
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, it is pretty broadly used.

636
01:40:31,375 --> 01:40:31,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

637
01:40:33,656 --> 01:40:34,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau?

638
01:40:34,676 --> 01:40:35,617
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, thank you.

639
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:39,878
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the 14 million students, is that worldwide or within the U.S.?

640
01:40:40,779 --> 01:40:44,640
[SPEAKER_11]: Those numbers are the 16.2 million students.

641
01:40:44,961 --> 01:40:45,681
[SPEAKER_11]: That's worldwide.

642
01:40:51,751 --> 01:40:57,055
[SPEAKER_11]: So we administer the test three times a year, and you can see the different levels, the different subjects.

643
01:40:57,215 --> 01:40:59,817
[SPEAKER_11]: In general, we're talking about September, January, and May.

644
01:41:01,739 --> 01:41:04,201
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see the specific dates there.

645
01:41:04,441 --> 01:41:11,046
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, we try to vary it a little bit, but in general, three times a year during those months.

646
01:41:11,947 --> 01:41:20,033
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, now moving on to the MAP test results, which is, I think, what the committee really wanted to hear tonight, among other things.

647
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:40,434
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so before we go into the actual data, it is important because the way that we have presented the data to you, we have measured Medford scores against the RIT or the RUSH 2020 norm scores.

648
01:41:41,254 --> 01:41:47,840
[SPEAKER_11]: So Medford's district school and rate this ethnicity subgroup data is compared to these 2020,

649
01:41:49,810 --> 01:41:52,354
[SPEAKER_11]: BAP national norms in this report.

650
01:41:52,374 --> 01:41:52,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, not 2023, but 2020.

651
01:41:55,585 --> 01:41:59,327
[SPEAKER_11]: And the reason is because these norms are done every few years.

652
01:41:59,367 --> 01:42:00,828
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not done every year.

653
01:42:01,529 --> 01:42:08,533
[SPEAKER_11]: So they conduct norming studies every three to five years to provide the best and most up-to-date information about student achievement and growth.

654
01:42:09,253 --> 01:42:21,380
[SPEAKER_11]: The 2020 norms describe achievement and growth trends for the US public school student population in language usage, mathematics, reading, and science over the 15, 16, 16, 17, and 17, 18 school years.

655
01:42:24,262 --> 01:42:26,104
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so that's just important for you to know.

656
01:42:26,124 --> 01:42:28,265
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about pre-pandemic numbers.

657
01:42:29,046 --> 01:42:44,697
[SPEAKER_11]: When we look at Medford's numbers compared to the norm, the national norm, we're talking about that 15, 16, 16, 17, 17, 18 data that got compiled into the 2020 norm numbers that came out.

658
01:42:45,138 --> 01:42:47,720
[SPEAKER_11]: The results are based on K-12 grade level samples.

659
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:51,042
[SPEAKER_11]: Records are sampled between 3.6 and 5.5 million test scores.

660
01:42:54,241 --> 01:43:03,487
[SPEAKER_11]: from 500,000 to 700,000 students attending over 24,500 public schools in 5,800 districts and spread across all 50 states.

661
01:43:03,788 --> 01:43:07,450
[SPEAKER_11]: So these norms are based on public school data, not private school data.

662
01:43:08,231 --> 01:43:22,921
[SPEAKER_11]: It's rigorous sampling, as we know when we're gonna make projections about data, it is important that the sample be wide, and we can see with the numbers, it is wide, and they try to make it as representative as possible to the public school population.

663
01:43:24,926 --> 01:43:29,352
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so looking at some data here, you can see that we have in blue, we have the ELA.

664
01:43:29,412 --> 01:43:29,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

665
01:43:34,236 --> 01:43:37,137
[SPEAKER_11]: You can see in blue, we have the ELA mean RIT data.

666
01:43:37,937 --> 01:43:40,298
[SPEAKER_11]: We have the national numbers and we have district numbers.

667
01:43:40,818 --> 01:43:44,279
[SPEAKER_11]: In yellow, we have math and in green, we have science.

668
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:54,742
[SPEAKER_11]: So for ELA in grades two, three, four, five, six, seven, and nine, the mean RIT scores in Medford were higher than the national mean RIT score.

669
01:43:56,022 --> 01:44:02,384
[SPEAKER_11]: In math, you can see the grades one, four, nine, and 10 mean RIT scores were higher than the national mean RIT score.

670
01:44:03,496 --> 01:44:09,239
[SPEAKER_11]: And in science, we're looking at all grades tested in the district had a mean RIT score higher than the national norm.

671
01:44:13,162 --> 01:44:13,482
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

672
01:44:13,622 --> 01:44:14,683
[SPEAKER_15]: I just had a quick question.

673
01:44:14,703 --> 01:44:20,126
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we're looking at those scores, what's a significant difference?

674
01:44:20,306 --> 01:44:25,529
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've got, just looking at second grade, we've got 172.35 for the national and we're at 175.8.

675
01:44:25,649 --> 01:44:26,270
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that significant?

676
01:44:31,007 --> 01:44:32,087
[SPEAKER_15]: a significant difference?

677
01:44:32,107 --> 01:44:34,928
[SPEAKER_15]: I found myself wondering that as I was looking through the scores.

678
01:44:35,349 --> 01:44:36,749
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't really have a good handle on that.

679
01:44:37,489 --> 01:44:41,631
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not sure that I have an answer for you on that.

680
01:44:41,731 --> 01:44:50,054
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that question has been raised in the past, I think, by Mr. Russo, who I think has in the past asked about statistically significant numbers on MCAS differences.

681
01:44:52,088 --> 01:44:54,849
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't answer that question.

682
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:58,771
[SPEAKER_11]: It's difficult to do the comparison.

683
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:01,553
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a little bit easier to do comparison with MCAS numbers.

684
01:45:01,913 --> 01:45:08,876
[SPEAKER_11]: It is a little bit more difficult with MAP, because the only thing we can really compare it to is that 2020 mean RIT score.

685
01:45:12,538 --> 01:45:18,981
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're not saying here that because we're above in these areas, it's great news.

686
01:45:19,361 --> 01:45:20,921
[SPEAKER_11]: It's an observation to make.

687
01:45:21,382 --> 01:45:36,888
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I will go back to when we look at these map growth scores on the district level, on the school level, on the classroom level, what's really meaningful for us and what we think is really meaningful for students' families is when we look at those individual student reports.

688
01:45:37,708 --> 01:45:41,111
[SPEAKER_11]: and we can see the growth of an individual student.

689
01:45:41,532 --> 01:45:44,975
[SPEAKER_11]: We can look at the reports, and Mr. DeLave is going to go over some of the reports.

690
01:45:45,335 --> 01:45:52,982
[SPEAKER_11]: We can look at a report and see student A is developing in this area, is ready to develop in this area.

691
01:45:53,022 --> 01:45:58,347
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think the most important results that we get are on a lower level.

692
01:45:59,108 --> 01:46:00,669
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not diminishing this.

693
01:46:00,949 --> 01:46:02,271
[SPEAKER_11]: I wish I had an answer for you.

694
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:10,122
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess all I can say is in these areas that we've highlighted, we are above the national mean.

695
01:46:13,142 --> 01:46:30,787
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess part of what I'm wondering is I know in terms of the ELA scores, we're looking to see, partly we're hoping to see that both with our new reading program, which of course we wouldn't see that influence yet, but with the ECRI that's been in place for a few years now,

696
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:33,471
[SPEAKER_15]: How is that impacting our scores?

697
01:46:33,591 --> 01:46:36,392
[SPEAKER_15]: Are the kids doing better than they were previously?

698
01:46:37,312 --> 01:46:43,314
[SPEAKER_15]: So how do you make that judgment if you don't know what a significant difference is, I guess is what I'm wondering.

699
01:46:43,514 --> 01:46:44,895
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have a way of looking at that?

700
01:46:45,905 --> 01:46:51,408
[SPEAKER_11]: So I believe it was last spring when we delivered the results, the spring results for MAP.

701
01:46:52,208 --> 01:46:58,611
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe it was a 70% growth in, it was a grade three, or we did see growth.

702
01:46:58,971 --> 01:47:04,414
[SPEAKER_11]: So when we do this report later on in the year, I think we're gonna be able to make that connection.

703
01:47:04,874 --> 01:47:13,138
[SPEAKER_11]: MAP doesn't allow, there's not a lot of flexibility with the analytical tools to make a link between

704
01:47:14,776 --> 01:47:15,917
[SPEAKER_11]: one year to the next.

705
01:47:16,357 --> 01:47:27,507
[SPEAKER_11]: But when you're doing it within a year, you have a little bit more that you can play with.

706
01:47:27,827 --> 01:47:31,811
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to reiterate one thing that Dr. Riccadeli said beautifully, by the way.

707
01:47:32,591 --> 01:47:41,279
[SPEAKER_05]: And Mr. DeLaver is going to cover the reports again, but I just think it's very crucial that the importance of MAP

708
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:44,381
[SPEAKER_05]: data is to inform instruction.

709
01:47:45,142 --> 01:47:55,146
[SPEAKER_05]: It is very difficult, it's clunky to do this district-wide view because you're not going to really be able to do that dive that maybe you're talking about.

710
01:47:55,186 --> 01:48:07,232
[SPEAKER_05]: The importance of map data for us as educators, both administrators and teachers, is to have that information to inform instruction, to help

711
01:48:07,691 --> 01:48:11,493
[SPEAKER_05]: which I don't wanna, Mr. DeLay was gonna talk about how we're using all of this data.

712
01:48:11,953 --> 01:48:37,266
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know if maybe we wanna like, I don't know, maybe press pause and then come back to it because the other pieces with the emergence of the early literacy screening tools, we've also brought in DIBLS, which as I informed the community and parents, K and one are using that explicitly for early literacy.

713
01:48:38,153 --> 01:48:38,593
[SPEAKER_05]: screening.

714
01:48:38,773 --> 01:48:47,135
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're not starting MAP until grade two, which is more appropriate when we're really looking at how they're applying those skills and when the comprehension comes in.

715
01:48:47,575 --> 01:48:58,357
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know we may not have answered your question wholly, but maybe if we could like keep going and then we can get to the nitty gritty.

716
01:48:58,977 --> 01:49:02,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

717
01:49:02,837 --> 01:49:05,318
[SPEAKER_13]: Mayor, can I just ask one more question?

718
01:49:05,338 --> 01:49:05,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

719
01:49:08,297 --> 01:49:17,443
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought the value of math was that you could connect performance year to year, and now you're saying that's not true.

720
01:49:19,865 --> 01:49:20,325
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is it?

721
01:49:21,086 --> 01:49:34,214
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can by student, but so I think, Mr. DeLeva, correct me if I'm wrong, doing it, linking from say spring of 2023 to fall of 2023 on a large scale basis

722
01:49:38,868 --> 01:49:48,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's, it's, it's, we were talking, it's like the funnel, so the district's the top of the funnel, and we are going all the way down.

723
01:49:51,833 --> 01:49:54,014
[SPEAKER_02]: District, school, class.

724
01:49:56,415 --> 01:50:03,097
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think the hard part is, you know, just getting to know this a little bit better.

725
01:50:11,192 --> 01:50:15,037
[SPEAKER_10]: On a district level, I think the next slide is kind of

726
01:50:59,025 --> 01:51:02,687
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I think the reason I'm asking, let me just like tell you why I'm asking.

727
01:51:03,087 --> 01:51:08,651
[SPEAKER_13]: If that's true, then why are we crushing students and teachers under three iterations of this in a school year?

728
01:51:09,195 --> 01:51:12,281
[SPEAKER_13]: The last of which comes like hot on the heels of MCAS.

729
01:51:12,321 --> 01:51:15,728
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we're saying, well, it's not really like data we can use the next year anyway.

730
01:51:15,768 --> 01:51:16,810
[SPEAKER_13]: And if that's true, like.

731
01:51:17,904 --> 01:51:23,067
[SPEAKER_13]: Why are we testing for the sake of testing, I think is what I'm wondering about.

732
01:51:23,187 --> 01:51:29,610
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's value in that carryover in terms of informing instruction, then I think it makes a lot of sense.

733
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:34,852
[SPEAKER_13]: But I feel like I'm sort of hearing either we're not using it that way right now or it's not true.

734
01:51:34,952 --> 01:51:40,335
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't know which, but I'm just really trying to understand there's a lot of testing that goes on.

735
01:51:40,415 --> 01:51:44,177
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know that we can't just say we're not going to do MCAS.

736
01:51:44,237 --> 01:51:44,677
[SPEAKER_13]: I get it.

737
01:51:45,546 --> 01:51:52,648
[SPEAKER_13]: it's still, it's a lot, like it's a lot of days of testing and could the kids be actually learning something instead, is my question.

738
01:51:56,669 --> 01:52:00,410
[SPEAKER_05]: So, trying to see where I want to begin with this.

739
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:10,953
[SPEAKER_05]: You are correct in, we've been having a lot of these conversations internally as well, because we want to make sure that we have the appropriate data to inform our instruction.

740
01:52:11,614 --> 01:52:12,894
[SPEAKER_05]: Part of this

741
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:33,183
[SPEAKER_05]: part of this as we go along with the iteration of it all, there's the reason that I just spoke about why we are no longer using it for reading for K and one, because dibbles is giving us, and some of the other things that we're doing with the QPS and additional screeners, that's giving us the information that we need.

742
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:40,469
[SPEAKER_05]: So K and not K, but grade one is, is we're using it for math because it's an important data point.

743
01:52:41,109 --> 01:52:43,651
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also having conversations and, um,

744
01:52:44,181 --> 01:52:52,745
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe Nicole can speak to it as well, around the validity for 10th grade because of MCAS and how much we are using the data.

745
01:52:52,805 --> 01:53:02,169
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are having a lot of those internal conversations to make sure that we are using the data appropriately to inform our instruction.

746
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:05,951
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the piece of it is,

747
01:53:06,892 --> 01:53:21,943
[SPEAKER_05]: We can, just to go back to the way it's scored, it's all of the norm measures that Dr., and please correct me, that Dr. Riccadeli spoke about, but it also targets the exact time in which the students take it.

748
01:53:22,203 --> 01:53:30,149
[SPEAKER_05]: So nationally, we're not going to be, our students are gonna be scored against other students that took it within that timeframe.

749
01:53:31,090 --> 01:53:34,933
[SPEAKER_05]: So sometimes with the way our cohorts go,

750
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:43,984
[SPEAKER_05]: there are different blocks of time in which we can use the data based on when the assessments were taken.

751
01:53:44,664 --> 01:53:58,352
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the other piece that we're kind of growing with this program and with the data is also we don't want to over test students, but we want valid data that we can use to inform our instruction.

752
01:53:58,772 --> 01:54:02,314
[SPEAKER_05]: And last year there was a little blip because

753
01:54:03,985 --> 01:54:12,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this balance of not over-assessing, but some of the EL students did not take, map all three terms.

754
01:54:13,493 --> 01:54:28,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that makes it difficult for us to then use that data and say that the data from last year is going to be exactly accurate when we're looking at the growth of students because it wasn't the same participants in each data set.

755
01:54:29,706 --> 01:54:33,529
[SPEAKER_05]: This year, we are going to have all students participate,

756
01:54:34,295 --> 01:54:38,836
[SPEAKER_05]: in that so that we are going to have clear, clean data to be able to use.

757
01:54:38,856 --> 01:54:42,738
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

758
01:54:46,839 --> 01:54:55,722
[SPEAKER_11]: So just moving on, so this slide is really a depiction of the, let me just go back, of this.

759
01:54:55,762 --> 01:54:56,882
[SPEAKER_11]: So we took a look at this data.

760
01:54:57,972 --> 01:55:02,496
[SPEAKER_11]: This one, this is a depiction really where you can see the red norm line.

761
01:55:03,337 --> 01:55:06,780
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the same for, I apologize.

762
01:55:09,202 --> 01:55:11,144
[SPEAKER_11]: This is grade six to 12.

763
01:55:11,184 --> 01:55:15,888
[SPEAKER_11]: So really it's just a visual depiction of that first chart of data that we looked at.

764
01:55:16,688 --> 01:55:18,150
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, moving along.

765
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:20,692
[SPEAKER_11]: So this slide, this is where we,

766
01:55:22,321 --> 01:55:32,430
[SPEAKER_11]: several of us that got together, we looked at the data, and the full set of data can be found in the appendix at the end of the presentation.

767
01:55:33,471 --> 01:55:40,337
[SPEAKER_11]: So it yields some descriptive information about the variations in schools, grades, and ethnic groups.

768
01:55:41,138 --> 01:55:47,844
[SPEAKER_11]: And while there are many, many observations that we can make, what we decided to do here was just to highlight some of the ones that

769
01:55:48,294 --> 01:55:50,635
[SPEAKER_11]: that we saw that kind of stood out.

770
01:55:51,275 --> 01:56:06,020
[SPEAKER_11]: So the first bullet here, it says, in science, the mean RIT scores for all elementary schools, so all four elementary schools in grades four, five, seven, eight, nine, and 10 across the district were higher than the national mean RIT score.

771
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:07,381
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, that is in science.

772
01:56:08,361 --> 01:56:09,702
[SPEAKER_11]: We're just gonna take a look at that.

773
01:56:09,722 --> 01:56:13,423
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so when we look at science,

774
01:56:15,093 --> 01:56:32,003
[SPEAKER_11]: We can see here that, so in grades three, four, and five, we can see in science at the Brooks Elementary School, the school-rate scores are higher than the national norm.

775
01:56:32,683 --> 01:56:42,109
[SPEAKER_11]: If we flip over to the McGlynn Elementary, we look at science, we can also see that they are above the national norm.

776
01:56:43,308 --> 01:56:44,629
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know I'm going quickly here.

777
01:56:44,689 --> 01:56:50,333
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to scroll next to the Missittuck Elementary, looking at that green column, looking at science.

778
01:56:50,734 --> 01:56:55,737
[SPEAKER_11]: We can see the same, where the school scores are higher than the national norm.

779
01:56:56,398 --> 01:57:04,424
[SPEAKER_11]: And then lastly, to the Roberts, we see the same thing in the green column, where the school WRIT scores are higher than the national mean.

780
01:57:04,884 --> 01:57:18,236
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, it's not that we are equating the norm with excellence, it's something that we're taking a look at, and we can obviously see that our schools scored higher than that norm.

781
01:57:20,978 --> 01:57:24,261
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on to the second bullet, taking a look at the Brooks data.

782
01:57:24,281 --> 01:57:31,748
[SPEAKER_11]: At the Brooks Elementary School, the mean RIT scores for ELA, math, and science in all grades were higher than the national mean RIT scores

783
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:34,971
[SPEAKER_11]: in those same content areas.

784
01:57:35,551 --> 01:57:45,933
[SPEAKER_11]: So taking a look at that data at the Brooks Elementary School, you can see in the ELA column in blue, the school scores are higher than the national mean.

785
01:57:46,433 --> 01:57:54,815
[SPEAKER_11]: The math scores identified in yellow are higher than the national mean, and the same for science in the grades that were tested.

786
01:57:56,335 --> 01:58:00,816
[SPEAKER_11]: So clearly at the Brooks, we're seeing

787
01:58:02,523 --> 01:58:03,964
[SPEAKER_11]: we're seeing higher than norm scores.

788
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:20,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Going down to the third bullet, in grade four across the district, all schools had higher mean RIT scores than the national norm RIT in ELA and science.

789
01:58:20,238 --> 01:58:22,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Not math, but ELA and science.

790
01:58:22,099 --> 01:58:22,860
[SPEAKER_11]: Math was close.

791
01:58:23,479 --> 01:58:26,281
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there was one school that was off.

792
01:58:26,621 --> 01:58:37,049
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we look at the ELA and science scores at the Brooks, okay, we already kind of took a look at the science, but we can see the ELA scores.

793
01:58:42,814 --> 01:58:52,141
[SPEAKER_11]: At the McGlynn, we can see the ELA scores, the ELA and the science scores are higher.

794
01:58:54,306 --> 01:58:56,468
[SPEAKER_11]: At the Missituk Elementary, the same.

795
01:58:56,488 --> 01:59:04,453
[SPEAKER_11]: And then lastly, at the Roberts Elementary School.

796
01:59:05,173 --> 01:59:05,634
[SPEAKER_11]: So again.

797
01:59:08,856 --> 01:59:09,656
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

798
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:15,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Next one.

799
01:59:20,564 --> 01:59:21,004
[SPEAKER_11]: Other side.

800
01:59:23,413 --> 01:59:34,159
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, the next bullet, the Asian, Black, White, and Latino subgroups in grade two with the Roberts all had a mean RIT higher than the national mean RIT in ELA.

801
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:51,990
[SPEAKER_11]: So with regard to, again, those subgroups, the subgroups that are available in the MAP test, we can see that the means in those different ethnic groups are higher than the national mean in grade two.

802
02:00:04,474 --> 02:00:06,016
[SPEAKER_10]: We knew you were going to ask that.

803
02:00:13,323 --> 02:00:13,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

804
02:00:16,426 --> 02:00:16,646
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

805
02:00:20,196 --> 02:00:27,340
[SPEAKER_10]: We're having an issue because what's pulling the student data is the Clever from School Brains is putting it into MAP.

806
02:00:28,261 --> 02:00:38,508
[SPEAKER_10]: So we were able to get this subgroup data, but I'm trying to figure out why we're not being able to pull the other data because School Brains does identify those factors.

807
02:00:38,768 --> 02:00:42,510
[SPEAKER_10]: So we haven't been able to grasp at this yet.

808
02:00:42,750 --> 02:00:47,813
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I'm sort of jumping ahead in my part of the presentation, but we're also trying to get,

809
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:50,700
[SPEAKER_10]: which I think Ms.

810
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:59,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Galushi is going to bring up as well, a program that's going to kind of tie everything in together so that we can isolate that quicker.

811
02:00:59,543 --> 02:01:09,006
[SPEAKER_10]: But the hope is that we can get that when we get to the fall, the winter, the winter time, but we weren't able to pull it from this report.

812
02:01:09,046 --> 02:01:10,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise we definitely would have put that in.

813
02:01:14,508 --> 02:01:16,029
[SPEAKER_10]: I, whatever the committee wants.

814
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:19,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

815
02:01:23,186 --> 02:01:29,388
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, so we're just moving on the second column on that page.

816
02:01:29,528 --> 02:01:37,050
[SPEAKER_11]: At Medford High School, the school mean RIT scores were higher than or equal to the national mean RIT in ELA, math, and science.

817
02:01:38,251 --> 02:01:42,052
[SPEAKER_11]: So if we take a look at the Medford High School data, we can see that.

818
02:01:49,793 --> 02:02:04,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Moving on, at Medford High School, and that includes Medford Vocational Technical High School, the Asian subgroup scored higher than the national norm in ELA, math, and science.

819
02:02:04,843 --> 02:02:11,968
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is, okay, this is the right slide.

820
02:02:12,248 --> 02:02:16,811
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also can see that the white subgroup also scored higher.

821
02:02:20,302 --> 02:02:21,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

822
02:02:21,703 --> 02:02:23,624
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been confused by this slide.

823
02:02:23,684 --> 02:02:25,065
[SPEAKER_00]: It's come up a couple of times now.

824
02:02:27,246 --> 02:02:30,188
[SPEAKER_00]: When it says the national, that's the national of all students.

825
02:02:30,688 --> 02:02:38,113
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just confused why we would compare subgroups to all students, which make that comparison sure.

826
02:02:38,773 --> 02:02:43,536
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would like to know how our Asian students are doing to the national Asian students.

827
02:02:43,776 --> 02:02:46,118
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, because

828
02:02:49,249 --> 02:02:52,952
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess this is, to me, seems like not terribly important data.

829
02:02:53,432 --> 02:02:58,216
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna know how our black students are doing compared to the black students nationally.

830
02:02:59,396 --> 02:03:03,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's why we even have subgroups.

831
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:07,842
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not to compare them to the big number for all students.

832
02:03:08,023 --> 02:03:08,423
[SPEAKER_00]: It's to compare.

833
02:03:08,443 --> 02:03:09,243
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information.

834
02:03:12,526 --> 02:03:16,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Member McLaughlin, or I would question that.

835
02:03:22,281 --> 02:03:36,511
[SPEAKER_14]: that it's important to compare subgroup to subgroup, but it is also very important to compare subgroup to national or international, so that you're getting it across sector of data.

836
02:03:36,811 --> 02:03:37,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

837
02:03:37,191 --> 02:03:38,672
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't say that it wasn't important.

838
02:03:38,732 --> 02:03:40,874
[SPEAKER_00]: I said it was not the only important thing.

839
02:03:40,894 --> 02:03:42,235
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.

840
02:03:43,095 --> 02:03:44,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So that wasn't a question, though.

841
02:03:44,296 --> 02:03:45,657
[SPEAKER_00]: Point of information is a question.

842
02:03:46,077 --> 02:03:46,137
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

843
02:03:47,738 --> 02:03:57,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, so this slide does not give us the information we need, and I'm assuming NWEA map does provide that, or maybe they don't.

844
02:03:57,883 --> 02:04:00,285
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I'm not sure what the point of this slide is.

845
02:04:00,885 --> 02:04:01,825
[SPEAKER_10]: We wouldn't put it in.

846
02:04:03,466 --> 02:04:04,547
[SPEAKER_10]: We were thinking the same thing.

847
02:04:04,707 --> 02:04:11,931
[SPEAKER_10]: We just couldn't find the numbers on their website or anything to get that.

848
02:04:13,649 --> 02:04:25,292
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess I'm confused why they would provide us the ability to see how our subgroups are doing, but then also not provide any information about how subgroups are doing nationally.

849
02:04:25,352 --> 02:04:30,113
[SPEAKER_00]: That does not seem like a reasonable thing for a product to provide.

850
02:04:30,633 --> 02:04:36,274
[SPEAKER_00]: They must have those things because they are providing those delineated pieces of information to us.

851
02:04:37,652 --> 02:04:41,173
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we didn't do these calculations, they came from their product.

852
02:04:41,694 --> 02:04:45,655
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know how these subgroups are doing nationally.

853
02:04:46,015 --> 02:04:59,420
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether they're willing to share it, maybe they have a reason for not sharing it, but I really feel like somebody needs to figure that out because it's just critical information.

854
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:02,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I feel like if we're not gonna know that at all,

855
02:05:06,983 --> 02:05:17,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways, I just think that this slide is definitely missing something and somebody should call them up and ask them what the heck's going on because it's critical.

856
02:05:17,687 --> 02:05:25,610
[SPEAKER_00]: It is certainly critical to know against the, like these categories right here, by the way, these are Medford's categories.

857
02:05:26,491 --> 02:05:29,772
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the Medford ninth grade?

858
02:05:30,072 --> 02:05:35,554
[SPEAKER_00]: I see national, there should be another column there for district also that covers all students.

859
02:05:38,121 --> 02:05:45,363
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be on the same slide though.

860
02:05:45,403 --> 02:05:53,066
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, these four, Asian, black, white, and Latino are all Medford numbers, right?

861
02:05:54,036 --> 02:05:58,717
[SPEAKER_00]: because nobody really wants to sit here and just discuss their data nationally.

862
02:05:59,257 --> 02:06:08,560
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of those things averaged together based on the number of students, et cetera, would provide us with the district number is, which I think was on another slide somewhere.

863
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:13,781
[SPEAKER_00]: So slide eight, thank you.

864
02:09:16,971 --> 02:09:32,957
[SPEAKER_11]: You're gonna hear from Mr. DeLeva in just a couple of minutes, the connection, actually a very real connection between MAP and MCAS that I think has a lot of utility for us, our students and moving forward.

865
02:09:33,598 --> 02:09:40,701
[SPEAKER_11]: So at this point, I am gonna turn it over to Mr. DeLeva.

866
02:09:41,441 --> 02:09:45,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I get started, I wanted to, this might be the last time I see some members.

867
02:09:48,206 --> 02:09:49,486
[SPEAKER_10]: congratulations on your service.

868
02:09:49,526 --> 02:09:50,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for everything.

869
02:09:50,487 --> 02:09:54,568
[SPEAKER_10]: And then welcome our new members as well, uh, to the committee as well.

870
02:09:54,848 --> 02:10:05,490
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, also want to make sure that I do give credit to Dr. Riccidelli, uh, Rocco Sieri and Faiza Khan, because we've sort of all been, yep.

871
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:09,331
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I said Dr. Kia, I didn't say Dr. Kia, I apologize for that.

872
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:26,610
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it me?

873
02:10:26,630 --> 02:10:27,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I keep hitting it?

874
02:10:27,411 --> 02:10:28,452
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

875
02:10:29,272 --> 02:10:29,592
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

876
02:10:29,793 --> 02:10:30,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

877
02:10:31,434 --> 02:10:32,294
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the help.

878
02:10:32,374 --> 02:10:32,715
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

879
02:10:34,176 --> 02:10:35,056
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wearing glasses now.

880
02:10:35,116 --> 02:10:37,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I used to never have to do that.

881
02:10:38,458 --> 02:10:43,282
[SPEAKER_10]: But to reiterate the point is that I think we use multiple data points.

882
02:10:44,423 --> 02:10:47,646
[SPEAKER_10]: And map is just one of those data points that we use.

883
02:10:47,666 --> 02:10:48,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we use MCAS.

884
02:10:50,048 --> 02:10:51,169
[SPEAKER_10]: As Ms.

885
02:10:51,189 --> 02:10:53,511
[SPEAKER_10]: Galusi said, we're using dibbles on the upper grade.

886
02:10:53,591 --> 02:11:02,818
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're trying to get a picture on that data, and we never really before delved as deep as we have before.

887
02:11:03,539 --> 02:11:05,439
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we're doing that now.

888
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:20,103
[SPEAKER_10]: Part of the work that I have been doing, and I'll get into it a little bit more later too, is I've been going and meeting with, it's been great, across the whole district, I've been meeting with teams of teachers and sort of reviewing their map and kind of coming up with plans.

889
02:11:20,703 --> 02:11:28,325
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we're already excited to go into the winter season and then review that again.

890
02:11:29,125 --> 02:11:35,689
[SPEAKER_10]: So on a level of instructional data, I think that's the bigger piece here.

891
02:11:37,070 --> 02:11:56,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I know on the district data, it's kind of so broad, but I think when we funnel it down, it gets to be a little bit more inclusive and identifying things and making groups on students and talking about areas of focus and stuff like that, because MAP does identify that.

892
02:11:57,321 --> 02:12:01,583
[SPEAKER_10]: So what you have here on this slide here is MAP actually has a predictor.

893
02:12:02,444 --> 02:12:15,870
[SPEAKER_10]: So it takes the, what I have here is the third grade fall from ELA projection to what we actually scored on MCAS in the spring.

894
02:12:16,530 --> 02:12:20,332
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you look here, we look for the little trends.

895
02:12:21,193 --> 02:12:25,255
[SPEAKER_10]: We were hoping that the red means not meeting expectations.

896
02:12:26,674 --> 02:12:31,537
[SPEAKER_10]: yellow, orange is more partially and green is meeting and blue is exceeding.

897
02:12:32,417 --> 02:12:35,619
[SPEAKER_10]: And the hope is that that trend is pretty close.

898
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:47,045
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously there's a close trend, but we have a greater number of students that we're not meeting in third grade for ELA based on what map had projected.

899
02:12:47,626 --> 02:12:49,587
[SPEAKER_10]: When we move to the next one, which is math,

900
02:12:51,487 --> 02:13:06,722
[SPEAKER_10]: a different kind of story where it projected that we would not meet expectations greater in the fall and we actually have less students that actually had done that and we have more students that are exceeding expectations.

901
02:13:07,423 --> 02:13:08,343
[SPEAKER_10]: for third grade math.

902
02:13:08,404 --> 02:13:13,606
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've done all the grades, but we've decided to make sure that we did third and eighth.

903
02:13:14,407 --> 02:13:19,389
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, 10th grade isn't pulling MCAS, but it is pulling SAT scores.

904
02:13:19,429 --> 02:13:20,830
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've been using that a little bit.

905
02:13:21,670 --> 02:13:23,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Can I just ask a quick question?

906
02:13:24,572 --> 02:13:30,655
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm looking at, um, what is this third grade math, third grade math.

907
02:13:31,455 --> 02:13:34,817
[SPEAKER_13]: And it looks like the numbers on the left add up to more than a hundred.

908
02:13:36,383 --> 02:13:36,763
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, you're right.

909
02:13:36,983 --> 02:13:37,764
[SPEAKER_10]: It does look like that.

910
02:13:37,784 --> 02:13:41,526
[SPEAKER_13]: Because I was trying to figure out like it looks similar, but it's.

911
02:13:42,686 --> 02:13:43,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you're right.

912
02:13:43,527 --> 02:13:44,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I was looking at the LA.

913
02:13:44,728 --> 02:13:45,808
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks the same on that too.

914
02:13:46,308 --> 02:13:47,269
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a reason for that?

915
02:13:47,509 --> 02:13:50,431
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is the graph I literally pulled from map.

916
02:13:52,052 --> 02:13:53,612
[SPEAKER_10]: It came from the map report.

917
02:13:54,753 --> 02:13:55,994
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not quite sure.

918
02:13:57,796 --> 02:13:58,837
[SPEAKER_10]: What is the story with the numbers?

919
02:13:58,897 --> 02:14:00,617
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd have to double check.

920
02:14:00,998 --> 02:14:02,558
[SPEAKER_10]: But right, everything should be equal to 100, right?

921
02:14:02,658 --> 02:14:03,379
[SPEAKER_10]: It shouldn't be.

922
02:14:03,459 --> 02:14:05,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yeah, it's just hard to compare.

923
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:11,383
[SPEAKER_13]: If this is a predictor, did we meet the prediction, or did we do better or worse than the prediction?

924
02:14:13,404 --> 02:14:17,025
[SPEAKER_13]: But you're never going to meet the prediction if you're not on the same scale, right?

925
02:14:17,045 --> 02:14:18,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Because on the right, 41.32.

926
02:14:22,811 --> 02:14:25,752
[SPEAKER_13]: 95, yeah, the one on the right adds up.

927
02:14:25,912 --> 02:14:32,094
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can't eyeball this and say we were on target or we weren't.

928
02:14:32,214 --> 02:14:37,997
[SPEAKER_13]: And I can't tell if it's because the left adds up to more than 100 or if we're really on target or not.

929
02:14:39,417 --> 02:14:42,018
[SPEAKER_13]: So it would be great if you could get an answer to that question.

930
02:14:42,118 --> 02:14:50,261
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, obviously not now, but I'll follow up and re-look at the numbers and see what came up on the predictor slide to see what

931
02:14:51,308 --> 02:14:54,691
[SPEAKER_10]: what pulled up and hopefully I can get to 100 and figure out what the problem is.

932
02:14:56,793 --> 02:15:09,044
[SPEAKER_10]: So then moving on as well with the eighth grade spring ELA scores and comparative to the in the fall compared to what we did in the spring.

933
02:15:09,124 --> 02:15:13,488
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'm looking just at the bars, but again, if the numbers don't add up, but

934
02:15:14,514 --> 02:15:18,817
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, again, when the number goes higher, you know, I'm looking at the trend on the red.

935
02:15:18,837 --> 02:15:24,722
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, we want more students not, you know, we don't want more students not meeting expectations.

936
02:15:24,782 --> 02:15:30,206
[SPEAKER_10]: We want more on the blue side of exceeding expectations or meeting expectations.

937
02:15:30,926 --> 02:15:39,293
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I look at that kind of trend, those are the things that I'm trying to talk about when I'm meeting with teachers as well, when they look at it from,

938
02:15:40,071 --> 02:15:42,512
[SPEAKER_10]: a grade level or a school level or anything like that.

939
02:15:42,552 --> 02:15:45,034
[SPEAKER_10]: Your presentation is more on a grade level.

940
02:15:46,154 --> 02:15:48,956
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, we're talking about funneling it down.

941
02:15:49,016 --> 02:15:52,758
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, when I move to math, same kind of idea.

942
02:15:53,658 --> 02:15:57,940
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to see greater greens and blues and less partial.

943
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:07,225
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think across the district, the partial is the bigger number that's there on every slide.

944
02:16:07,245 --> 02:16:09,106
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want to try to work and make sure we get

945
02:16:09,793 --> 02:16:10,834
[SPEAKER_10]: those students since the meeting?

946
02:16:11,294 --> 02:16:14,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think on the eighth grade one, the charts both add up to 100.

947
02:16:14,276 --> 02:16:22,401
[SPEAKER_13]: So is what this is telling us that MAP predicted we would have better MCAS results than we actually had?

948
02:16:24,262 --> 02:16:25,503
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking at the math one?

949
02:16:25,523 --> 02:16:25,923
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry.

950
02:16:27,123 --> 02:16:28,805
[SPEAKER_13]: Eighth grade, slide 16.

951
02:16:31,146 --> 02:16:31,906
[SPEAKER_10]: For ELA, right?

952
02:16:31,926 --> 02:16:32,407
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, ELA.

953
02:16:32,467 --> 02:16:32,787
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

954
02:16:33,527 --> 02:16:35,428
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, so exactly.

955
02:16:35,548 --> 02:16:36,608
[SPEAKER_10]: That's exactly what it says.

956
02:16:36,988 --> 02:16:45,430
[SPEAKER_10]: Based on the map scores in the fall, it was saying that this is if they were to take MCAS at this point, this is what they would have received.

957
02:16:45,630 --> 02:16:50,952
[SPEAKER_10]: But then when you look at the actual MCAS that did happen in the spring, that's what occurred.

958
02:16:50,992 --> 02:16:54,353
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, that's not the story where we're looking for.

959
02:16:54,433 --> 02:16:57,154
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to try it again, move more greens and blues.

960
02:16:57,634 --> 02:16:58,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

961
02:16:58,254 --> 02:16:58,714
[SPEAKER_10]: You're welcome.

962
02:16:58,854 --> 02:16:59,134
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

963
02:17:03,942 --> 02:17:08,403
[SPEAKER_10]: So when we do data analysis, and again, I want everyone to think of the funnel.

964
02:17:10,483 --> 02:17:16,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, the work that has been done has been working on a classroom level at each school.

965
02:17:17,005 --> 02:17:20,305
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll meet with the third grade, for example, at the Mississippi.

966
02:17:25,506 --> 02:17:26,246
[SPEAKER_10]: I did it this time.

967
02:17:26,566 --> 02:17:27,287
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, thank you.

968
02:17:27,927 --> 02:17:28,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, thank you, thank you.

969
02:17:31,206 --> 02:17:40,611
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I'll meet with the third grade teachers, I'll meet with the third grade special ed teachers, and we try to drill down things from the reports that I'm going to show you.

970
02:17:40,651 --> 02:17:46,595
[SPEAKER_10]: So we do a class report, we do some sorting, we then drill down on a student level.

971
02:17:47,835 --> 02:17:56,598
[SPEAKER_10]: We talk about doing interventions and how we would group students into reteaching or as well as enrichment as well.

972
02:17:56,658 --> 02:17:59,019
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, you have two sides to the coin.

973
02:17:59,039 --> 02:18:12,783
[SPEAKER_10]: We also want to make sure that our top students are getting what they need, right, with the win, as well as the students that need certain instruction to make sure that they're at the level of everybody else that's there.

974
02:18:12,823 --> 02:18:15,244
[SPEAKER_10]: So the differentiation that goes on.

975
02:18:16,516 --> 02:18:18,797
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we use a data protocol.

976
02:18:18,857 --> 02:18:30,223
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a data protocol that's in that link that sort of was developed by myself and a couple others so that we're also using time because time is a commodity when we're meeting with the teachers.

977
02:18:32,144 --> 02:18:40,608
[SPEAKER_10]: And I wanna thank the committee because I don't think if it was the change for the elementary side, they actually have time to meet because they always have that 1.30.

978
02:18:42,782 --> 02:18:49,294
[SPEAKER_10]: difference and now that they're following the same schedule as everyone else, you know, I can plan on where I'm meeting with everybody.

979
02:18:50,629 --> 02:18:57,473
[SPEAKER_10]: And kind of we make observations, we make certain inferences, and then we come up with action plans.

980
02:18:57,693 --> 02:19:09,199
[SPEAKER_10]: So coming around the next time around in the winter, that's where I'm gonna use the data and meet with them again to kind of say, okay, now we have the growth from fall to winter, because we don't have that right now.

981
02:19:09,660 --> 02:19:11,561
[SPEAKER_10]: We only have the fall at this point in time.

982
02:19:12,141 --> 02:19:15,043
[SPEAKER_10]: So I want the fall to winter to see where our students are at.

983
02:19:15,956 --> 02:19:16,657
[SPEAKER_10]: moving forward.

984
02:19:17,378 --> 02:19:23,086
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, we do that comparison of MCAS as well so that they can look at it.

985
02:19:23,146 --> 02:19:27,553
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually have a separate sheet that was created by myself over the summer.

986
02:19:28,334 --> 02:19:31,859
[SPEAKER_10]: So they've been kind of comparing points on their own when they're working with their students.

987
02:19:33,277 --> 02:19:39,199
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you look at this potential, everything's redacted and it's just a general report.

988
02:19:39,880 --> 02:19:44,181
[SPEAKER_10]: But this is the first report that the teachers go into because they go right into their classrooms.

989
02:19:45,002 --> 02:19:54,385
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I made the colors very similar to the other reports where greens and blues, we're doing good, yellows and reds, we really need to drill down and see.

990
02:19:55,125 --> 02:19:56,146
[SPEAKER_10]: We tend to sort that.

991
02:19:57,267 --> 02:20:04,931
[SPEAKER_10]: And we try to look at what the needs are of every student, meaning the blues and the greens as well as the reds and the yellows.

992
02:20:06,712 --> 02:20:16,477
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I move into the next one, a little delay there, and I didn't touch any button.

993
02:20:19,087 --> 02:20:24,331
[SPEAKER_10]: The quadrant chart obviously is what we're always looking for, which is growth and achievement.

994
02:20:25,012 --> 02:20:33,839
[SPEAKER_10]: Now what this is doing is it is, this chart is taking previous student scores and making a growth chart from that.

995
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:43,367
[SPEAKER_10]: So you have students that are in the upper quadrant there, that's their achieving and growing, and you have students in the yellow down below that are showing high achievement.

996
02:20:44,027 --> 02:20:47,650
[SPEAKER_10]: And a reminder that with that, it's possible that students

997
02:20:51,250 --> 02:20:53,792
[SPEAKER_10]: are achieving, but they're already achieving at a high level, right?

998
02:20:53,892 --> 02:20:59,255
[SPEAKER_10]: So that they're going to end up staying stagnant, right, at a level.

999
02:20:59,395 --> 02:21:05,258
[SPEAKER_10]: And even though we want everyone in the green, some people are already high scored, and that's why they're down in that ever.

1000
02:21:05,818 --> 02:21:11,782
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, each one of these dots, you can unclick and identify student's name.

1001
02:21:12,486 --> 02:21:25,572
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's what the teachers do when they look to see where are our achievers using the MCAS data that I've given them already and this data to see what they can do to group students because they do have a period within the day called their wind blocks.

1002
02:21:27,192 --> 02:21:39,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Elementary uses them on a literacy basis, but the middle schools have them and even the tier two intervention that we can do at the high school of identifying students that could use it, you know,

1003
02:21:40,162 --> 02:21:41,223
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to pick and choose.

1004
02:21:41,463 --> 02:21:45,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Unfortunately, you lose an exploratory to get that.

1005
02:21:45,348 --> 02:21:50,794
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, if you're looking at your predictor, it might warrant that you need to do it.

1006
02:21:50,914 --> 02:22:00,965
[SPEAKER_10]: And as we talked at the MCAS meeting, and I'm looking at, remember, so we don't want to have a you're not graduating scenario.

1007
02:22:02,168 --> 02:22:11,674
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, using not just because you didn't do well on MCAS, but using this data as well as where they're at is a way for us to do some rescheduling.

1008
02:22:14,296 --> 02:22:16,157
[SPEAKER_10]: This is another way that they regroup as well.

1009
02:22:17,178 --> 02:22:21,701
[SPEAKER_10]: So map goes by areas of instruction.

1010
02:22:22,842 --> 02:22:27,105
[SPEAKER_10]: And so if you look at it, and it's a little fuzzy, I know, but it's,

1011
02:22:28,188 --> 02:22:32,071
[SPEAKER_10]: For algebra, right, algebraic thinking and numbering operations.

1012
02:22:32,791 --> 02:22:36,434
[SPEAKER_10]: So these students are put into groups by their RIT scores.

1013
02:22:36,994 --> 02:22:50,204
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, now a teacher already sees, okay, these students are here, I need to work with these students here, and figure out what I need to do in order to get them to move over in their instructional area.

1014
02:22:50,684 --> 02:22:57,829
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I look at this report with them, our goal is to see everyone start to move more to the right from there.

1015
02:22:59,209 --> 02:23:03,832
[SPEAKER_10]: This is probably my favorite report that I go with the teachers because this is the individual student report.

1016
02:23:04,572 --> 02:23:11,296
[SPEAKER_10]: So from that class report, what you're able to do is really drill down on a student individually.

1017
02:23:12,296 --> 02:23:25,624
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you look a little bit in the middle there, you can see what this particular student, they have identified suggested area of focus and they identify a student's strength.

1018
02:23:26,590 --> 02:23:40,842
[SPEAKER_10]: So here in math, this particular student really has some number in operations and I've shown teachers, if you click that, it gives the skill where the student is at and what they need to develop to improve that area of focus.

1019
02:23:42,444 --> 02:23:52,432
[SPEAKER_10]: On the other hand, the operations of algebraic thinking, they've met a lot of those criterias because they're above the mean of where they had scored.

1020
02:23:52,532 --> 02:23:54,174
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's how that gets identified.

1021
02:23:55,094 --> 02:24:15,028
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, when we're talking about when and regrouping, teachers are now looking at these charts, and they're also grouping their students because they want to do more of number and operations with certain students while, for example, with this student, if they were to go to more of an enrichment piece on operations and algebraic thinking.

1022
02:24:15,648 --> 02:24:16,369
[SPEAKER_11]: Can I just add something?

1023
02:24:16,389 --> 02:24:16,769
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, absolutely.

1024
02:24:16,809 --> 02:24:19,451
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is a report that some parents do request.

1025
02:24:25,293 --> 02:24:27,875
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not going to touch it.

1026
02:24:28,035 --> 02:24:34,879
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think it's, I mean, what it looks, it looks like one page here, but it prints out to 32 pages and it talks with the development in each one of these areas.

1027
02:24:34,899 --> 02:24:37,960
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's a lot of information that is yielded.

1028
02:24:38,381 --> 02:24:45,485
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I will go back to on the individual student level, there's a lot that is yielded with the map information.

1029
02:24:46,005 --> 02:24:52,889
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, you know, on the district level, you know, I'm, I'm in, I'm sensing some frustration and you're not alone.

1030
02:24:53,430 --> 02:25:00,497
[SPEAKER_11]: because it's just not as advanced as it is on the individual student and classroom level.

1031
02:25:03,219 --> 02:25:16,532
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and even if you look at this report as well, you have your, so that quadrant chart, like this student would be placed in the quadrant chart that's listed, but also tells us that this individual student

1032
02:25:17,388 --> 02:25:23,733
[SPEAKER_10]: would be partially meeting expectations based on their RIT score on the fall right now.

1033
02:25:24,233 --> 02:25:30,017
[SPEAKER_10]: But the hope is when you take the winter that we see an improvement on that moving forward.

1034
02:25:30,678 --> 02:25:40,525
[SPEAKER_10]: So these student reports are really the crux of what we're doing with teachers to kind of see where we're at and we're doing

1035
02:25:41,018 --> 02:25:44,840
[SPEAKER_10]: the data protocol to see like, okay, let's make an inference.

1036
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:46,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, what can we do?

1037
02:25:46,241 --> 02:25:47,461
[SPEAKER_10]: What can we do with instruction?

1038
02:25:48,001 --> 02:25:49,402
[SPEAKER_10]: How can we readjust some time?

1039
02:25:49,422 --> 02:25:53,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Because again, time seems to be the biggest factor in a lot of things.

1040
02:26:01,868 --> 02:26:02,488
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

1041
02:26:02,709 --> 02:26:03,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1042
02:26:04,529 --> 02:26:08,671
[SPEAKER_00]: Thinking about that quadrant chart, are teachers looking at that?

1043
02:26:09,532 --> 02:26:09,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1044
02:26:10,225 --> 02:26:20,807
[SPEAKER_00]: So a student that might have a whole pile of relative strengths and a major weakness could show up in that top right quadrant.

1045
02:26:21,607 --> 02:26:30,689
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm a teacher and I've got a bunch of students that I've got to focus on, I'm not clicking on that student because I have only so many hours in a day.

1046
02:26:31,129 --> 02:26:36,330
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we make sure that because this one data point is a student,

1047
02:26:37,332 --> 02:26:55,039
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we make sure that we don't have, I'm sure when teachers are receiving students into the middle school, into an algebra class or something, and then they find out that, why does little Johnny not know how to do this very basic thing, even though he got great grades and knew all these other concepts?

1048
02:26:56,759 --> 02:27:03,042
[SPEAKER_00]: It feels like that's a story we hear about when kids go off to college and they can't do some, frankly, basic things.

1049
02:27:03,922 --> 02:27:06,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just feel like this,

1050
02:27:06,704 --> 02:27:21,448
[SPEAKER_00]: average as a single data point for a student can seriously hide major deficiencies, or is that average not really an average, but it's some kind of other NWEA map calculation that prevents that?

1051
02:27:21,468 --> 02:27:34,051
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I can let you answer it, but I mean, so it's kind of what I said initially, that I think there are multiple data points that we use.

1052
02:27:34,875 --> 02:27:37,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, this is what I want more throughout the district.

1053
02:27:38,497 --> 02:27:40,858
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not the only driving force.

1054
02:27:41,498 --> 02:27:45,720
[SPEAKER_10]: There are other data points that we would use to identify that stuff.

1055
02:27:46,720 --> 02:28:02,848
[SPEAKER_10]: At the middle school level, for example, there is a block that's given on a Wednesday, I remember it, because AJ would know, that we would utilize this time to identify students that are getting their enrichment and getting

1056
02:28:03,601 --> 02:28:05,182
[SPEAKER_10]: what they need at that point in time.

1057
02:28:05,702 --> 02:28:11,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Called it RTI, now it changed all the way to WIN, which makes more sense, which is what I need.

1058
02:28:12,104 --> 02:28:22,209
[SPEAKER_10]: So the hope is that if we continue across doing these practices, that that person doesn't get missed from there.

1059
02:28:22,989 --> 02:28:24,449
[SPEAKER_10]: But like I said, multiple data points.

1060
02:28:24,790 --> 02:28:26,090
[SPEAKER_10]: You just mentioned student grades.

1061
02:28:26,930 --> 02:28:32,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, student grades also have to match out what a student actually understands and can produce.

1062
02:28:33,584 --> 02:28:39,449
[SPEAKER_10]: So therefore, I think that using those kinds of points kind of do it.

1063
02:28:39,529 --> 02:28:41,671
[SPEAKER_10]: My hope is that we don't miss that student.

1064
02:28:42,892 --> 02:28:45,454
[SPEAKER_10]: But I mean, sure.

1065
02:28:47,476 --> 02:28:52,280
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look, I also just because your question I think was specifically to the map data.

1066
02:28:53,781 --> 02:28:57,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is my favorite report as well, because it's also interactive.

1067
02:28:57,505 --> 02:29:00,027
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see that the way they've categorized math

1068
02:29:00,738 --> 02:29:02,159
[SPEAKER_05]: The student is scoring in the yellow.

1069
02:29:02,279 --> 02:29:04,681
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see that reading is a strength and science is a strength.

1070
02:29:05,061 --> 02:29:08,944
[SPEAKER_05]: But because the yellow was highlighted, there are a couple pieces here.

1071
02:29:09,025 --> 02:29:17,611
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you look at the top on the yellow, it's going to give the teachers the possible writ span of where this student should land.

1072
02:29:18,192 --> 02:29:22,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know it's super small print, I'm sorry, but it says between 184 and 190.

1073
02:29:24,454 --> 02:29:30,317
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're right, that average score, RIT score for this student is 187.

1074
02:29:30,878 --> 02:29:48,167
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you then look in the middle column, as Mr. DeLava was talking about, but these instructional areas, those are the ones that also give the specifics to, so like 175 for number and operations, that's lower than the RIT should be, right?

1075
02:29:48,227 --> 02:29:50,829
[SPEAKER_05]: So this student is fine

1076
02:29:51,994 --> 02:29:53,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Measurement and data is a strength.

1077
02:29:53,355 --> 02:29:56,596
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, operations and algebraic thinking is a strength.

1078
02:29:56,736 --> 02:30:02,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Measurement and data and geometry, the student is where they need to be because they're within the, or really close to the RIT score.

1079
02:30:03,459 --> 02:30:13,704
[SPEAKER_05]: But because number and operations is a suggested area of focus, as Mr. DeLava said, if teachers click on this, it does bring up all the standards, all the strands.

1080
02:30:14,184 --> 02:30:19,366
[SPEAKER_05]: It will give teachers where to start in terms of an instructional area of focus.

1081
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:31,986
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot on teachers, like teachers are rock stars, because what they have to do is meet their students' needs, and this is where the tier two piece comes in.

1082
02:30:32,386 --> 02:30:45,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mr. DeLava spoke about the wind block at the middle school level and at the elementary level, but if we're looking at math, a lot of that tier two time, there are multiple ways that the tier two time comes in.

1083
02:30:45,335 --> 02:30:47,977
[SPEAKER_05]: You heard Principal Kaye talk about ST Math.

1084
02:30:48,581 --> 02:30:51,882
[SPEAKER_05]: and we're trying to encourage that that is done for 10 minutes a day.

1085
02:30:52,202 --> 02:30:53,482
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an additional piece.

1086
02:30:53,943 --> 02:30:59,964
[SPEAKER_05]: It's normed the way Lexia Core 5 is, and it's all, it's language-free.

1087
02:31:00,265 --> 02:31:03,526
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's all conceptual mathematical problems.

1088
02:31:03,926 --> 02:31:15,929
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to meet the students where they are, and it's gonna push them where they need to be, or kind of adapt to where their areas of strength and challenge need to be.

1089
02:31:16,569 --> 02:31:17,790
[SPEAKER_05]: In addition to that,

1090
02:31:18,962 --> 02:31:41,236
[SPEAKER_05]: most math blocks are structured in a way at the elementary level so that the lesson is given and then there's a small group time component, which some may refer to as centers, some may refer to it as small group instruction, but the students, you know, if we look at even the scores or whatever, the students that are in that blue and in that green

1091
02:31:41,974 --> 02:31:54,660
[SPEAKER_05]: They can be more independent during that time, but the teacher may have a small group of students that are gonna need that, like, sheltered scaffold to be able to work on their areas of focus.

1092
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:57,362
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that help?

1093
02:31:57,442 --> 02:32:01,544
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps, but you said something just now that was sort of partially my point.

1094
02:32:01,864 --> 02:32:04,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Teachers are, there's only so many hours in a day for teachers.

1095
02:32:05,586 --> 02:32:09,948
[SPEAKER_00]: We just heard that at the Andrews, 2 3rds or 70% of kids made the honor roll.

1096
02:32:12,401 --> 02:32:21,146
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll go on a limb and bet that means a lot of kids, when we looked at this quadrant chart, were in that big green section for, let's pick math.

1097
02:32:24,688 --> 02:32:32,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm worried about is it's quite reasonable for teachers to be focusing on students in these other quadrants more.

1098
02:32:33,786 --> 02:32:35,247
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the students that are performing.

1099
02:32:35,367 --> 02:32:36,748
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the students that are growing.

1100
02:32:37,128 --> 02:32:39,250
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got so many hours or time in your class.

1101
02:32:39,590 --> 02:32:41,331
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are you going to put more attention on?

1102
02:32:41,371 --> 02:32:46,814
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to put it on the students who need more help, which is rational and reasonable.

1103
02:32:47,415 --> 02:32:51,497
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are one dot representing the students.

1104
02:32:51,658 --> 02:33:00,643
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be a rock star with these huge scores in some areas of math and then have some major deficits that are just not relevant to what's going on.

1105
02:33:02,418 --> 02:33:05,461
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just skate through with your A and sitting in the green.

1106
02:33:05,861 --> 02:33:12,947
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you go up to the next grade, this happened to one of my children who went into an honors math class.

1107
02:33:13,467 --> 02:33:15,589
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was because of the pandemic.

1108
02:33:15,649 --> 02:33:17,471
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't for any other reason.

1109
02:33:17,551 --> 02:33:23,836
[SPEAKER_00]: But there were whole sections of math for which the student couldn't perform, none of them, frankly.

1110
02:33:25,532 --> 02:33:45,655
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that's a different kind of situation because it was most of the students, I'm just worried about how if you have only so much time in the day and you're looking at this quadrant chart as your starting point for where to focus, you're not clicking on your students that are high performing, high growth already.

1111
02:33:46,636 --> 02:33:54,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is an average that will mean that you have, we put a billionaire in this room, average all of our incomes.

1112
02:33:54,448 --> 02:33:55,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Things look great.

1113
02:33:56,209 --> 02:33:59,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are not, we're not all making $100 million a year.

1114
02:34:00,331 --> 02:34:09,375
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just worry about the work that averages can really cause skewing within the individual student as well.

1115
02:34:11,876 --> 02:34:20,280
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe there's somebody that makes sure that every single one of these students was inspected at some regularity from this chart.

1116
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:35,597
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if that's your team or the principals, or does this pop out a report that says, hey, this teacher in math, there was never once did anybody inspect this report for this student this year.

1117
02:34:37,839 --> 02:34:38,959
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

1118
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:42,361
[SPEAKER_00]: That's after you've clicked the student, though.

1119
02:34:42,381 --> 02:34:46,143
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, but they have, yeah.

1120
02:34:49,004 --> 02:34:49,585
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yes.

1121
02:35:14,492 --> 02:35:15,432
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt that.

1122
02:35:15,772 --> 02:35:16,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1123
02:35:20,693 --> 02:35:21,593
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1124
02:35:22,173 --> 02:35:28,795
[SPEAKER_09]: To your point, Mr. Member, so if we look at English for a minute, we look at literary text versus informational.

1125
02:35:28,815 --> 02:35:30,215
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are two of the categories.

1126
02:35:30,355 --> 02:35:43,157
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we have math on this slide right now, but what we've done in our department at the secondary level and will do at the elementary level and have as well is let's say we have a student that's very strong in literacy.

1127
02:35:43,584 --> 02:35:44,565
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, literary text.

1128
02:35:45,685 --> 02:35:48,727
[SPEAKER_09]: Strong and informational, but there's a discrepancy there, right?

1129
02:35:48,747 --> 02:35:54,309
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're seeing, OK, we need to do more work in informational, even if they're not on the low side.

1130
02:35:54,750 --> 02:36:01,793
[SPEAKER_09]: We've looked as a department at those discrepancies to say, we need to build more muscle for informational text, for example.

1131
02:36:02,153 --> 02:36:12,439
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not so much your low achievement, high achievement, as it is as a group, like as an eighth grade group, let's say, that we see those discrepancies and we're able to kind of target it.

1132
02:36:14,673 --> 02:36:16,854
[SPEAKER_09]: looking into the depths of the curriculum.

1133
02:36:17,114 --> 02:36:18,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that help at all?

1134
02:36:19,755 --> 02:36:20,735
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's just one example.

1135
02:36:20,775 --> 02:36:34,540
[SPEAKER_09]: If I even look at grammar, and I mean to cut you off, but if we look at grammar and where we have some struggles, what can we do to build that strength, whether it's a higher-achieving student on that or struggling?

1136
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:36,081
[SPEAKER_00]: That does help.

1137
02:36:36,141 --> 02:36:42,943
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that sometimes we've heard tonight that it was the individual student was the strength of a lot of this reporting.

1138
02:36:44,457 --> 02:36:47,779
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're kind of back up to the middle of the curriculum.

1139
02:36:48,079 --> 02:36:48,780
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1140
02:36:49,140 --> 02:36:53,343
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, I think that that makes complete sense what you're describing, and that's great to hear.

1141
02:36:54,523 --> 02:37:04,730
[SPEAKER_00]: But if all this testing is about the individual student, then I'm interested in knowing that every individual student's report is looked at by every single teacher.

1142
02:37:04,910 --> 02:37:05,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1143
02:37:06,638 --> 02:37:21,623
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter whether the student is sitting up there in the top corner green and the teacher has 20 other students in the bottom quadrant who need a lot of time and focus, because a kid could not know how to deal with money, for instance.

1144
02:37:21,983 --> 02:37:32,466
[SPEAKER_00]: One of my children, math was fine, but then when the report came out, turns out they didn't know anything about money, which for those of us that can just, well, that's just percentages.

1145
02:37:36,314 --> 02:37:52,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I just worry about, and I think the teachers would worry about receiving students with major gaps that are missed because the report is an average for the whole individual student, which is not, you know, it's not how you teach new concepts in math in particular.

1146
02:37:52,861 --> 02:37:55,162
[SPEAKER_00]: You need those basic concepts, all of them.

1147
02:37:55,222 --> 02:37:57,162
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no like optional ones.

1148
02:37:58,103 --> 02:38:00,804
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'll stop because I've gone on too long, thank you.

1149
02:38:05,220 --> 02:38:06,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, member Hays.

1150
02:38:07,161 --> 02:38:14,323
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm looking at slide 21 or at least the numbers 21's class breakdown by instructional area.

1151
02:38:14,343 --> 02:38:28,267
[SPEAKER_15]: I would assume or hope that teachers would be looking at this that really gives you each student by you know it's not going to break it down maybe as far as you were suggesting member Rousseau but it does break it down by the areas.

1152
02:38:30,305 --> 02:38:33,807
[SPEAKER_15]: And it seems like that gives the teacher some good information about where.

1153
02:38:34,247 --> 02:38:50,275
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, what I don't understand on this and I wanted to ask was, is there a score that the teachers are looking for as the kind of, we'd like to see most of the kids falling in this score range.

1154
02:38:50,955 --> 02:38:55,637
[SPEAKER_15]: And so kids who are below that, we wanna look at whether they're struggling.

1155
02:38:56,698 --> 02:38:56,978
[SPEAKER_15]: You know?

1156
02:39:00,371 --> 02:39:12,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're trying to get our students home direction.

1157
02:39:13,717 --> 02:39:21,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that is the average, but that is the middle.

1158
02:39:23,182 --> 02:39:25,203
[SPEAKER_10]: But it varies by class, by class.

1159
02:39:25,503 --> 02:39:29,165
[SPEAKER_10]: So like the one class,

1160
02:39:32,349 --> 02:39:33,930
[SPEAKER_15]: well, that's problematic though, isn't it?

1161
02:39:33,970 --> 02:39:36,992
[SPEAKER_15]: We've got to have some standard that we're trying to get the kids all to.

1162
02:39:37,072 --> 02:39:52,001
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it's going to vary by class, when I know, so I guess where I'm struggling again is with, I think members so hit this a minute ago, we keep talking about the real value of this is that the individual student level, or maybe even the class level.

1163
02:39:52,281 --> 02:39:54,122
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that's wonderful.

1164
02:39:54,142 --> 02:39:58,805
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I remember before I was on school committee, when you were first talking about this assessment,

1165
02:40:00,330 --> 02:40:07,072
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, this is great because MCAS is no longer usable in that way and hasn't been for a very long time.

1166
02:40:07,472 --> 02:40:11,894
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was a real gap in having an assessment that we could use in that way.

1167
02:40:14,214 --> 02:40:15,195
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm confused.

1168
02:40:15,235 --> 02:40:29,559
[SPEAKER_15]: I find myself, I feel like we are kind of toggling back and forth between the top of the funnel and the bottom of the funnel when we start looking at, you know, when we say something like, well, it's going to be different for each class, but we need something.

1169
02:40:30,923 --> 02:40:38,303
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I guess I'm hoping also to get a better understanding of why why are we even being

1170
02:40:38,936 --> 02:40:42,739
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, let me rephrase that, that's not a nice way of putting it.

1171
02:40:42,779 --> 02:40:49,925
[SPEAKER_15]: The highlights were all really about scores at a higher level.

1172
02:40:50,306 --> 02:40:51,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you use those?

1173
02:40:51,707 --> 02:41:00,995
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you use, when you see that there's a difference between the subgroups, how does MAP help you use that knowledge, or does it?

1174
02:41:01,215 --> 02:41:06,819
[SPEAKER_15]: And if it doesn't, then, I don't know, is it worth even spending time talking about it?

1175
02:41:07,947 --> 02:41:10,348
[SPEAKER_15]: something else that helps us then at that level.

1176
02:41:11,088 --> 02:41:22,371
[SPEAKER_15]: So I guess that was a lot of questions rolled up into one, but I do feel like this conversation, this discussion is kind of going back and forth, you know, between the higher, the top of the funnel and the narrower end of the funnel.

1177
02:41:22,451 --> 02:41:34,834
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's hard for those of us who aren't using this consistently or, you know, understand it as well as you do to kind of tease out those differences and understand how this test is really being used.

1178
02:41:37,045 --> 02:41:42,708
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I was going to clarify about the reports is that they're all aligned by the skill or the standard.

1179
02:41:43,268 --> 02:41:50,532
[SPEAKER_05]: So how teachers or what reports teachers are using is going to be based on what they're looking for for their instruction.

1180
02:41:50,992 --> 02:42:02,258
[SPEAKER_05]: So the student profile report is going to give that individual breakdown so that teachers can see, okay, because math units, math lessons, math modules,

1181
02:42:03,683 --> 02:42:07,046
[SPEAKER_05]: they're focused on specific skills and standards.

1182
02:42:07,467 --> 02:42:10,009
[SPEAKER_05]: When those, and a lot of them are cyclical, right?

1183
02:42:10,029 --> 02:42:16,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So students, sometimes the intent of the lesson is just for exposure, and sometimes it's mastery.

1184
02:42:17,377 --> 02:42:27,747
[SPEAKER_05]: But having the individual in the student profile sample of where that student's strengths are, the teacher is going to be more informed when that topic comes up.

1185
02:42:28,706 --> 02:42:36,569
[SPEAKER_05]: to then be able to, when you look at this one, you can do this by the skill, by that target.

1186
02:42:36,970 --> 02:42:44,313
[SPEAKER_05]: So then when that lesson comes up, teachers can then take that skill and say, where did the students fall within that range?

1187
02:42:44,353 --> 02:42:48,115
[SPEAKER_05]: Because this is where I am, and this is where I wanna target my instruction.

1188
02:42:48,735 --> 02:42:53,857
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just a different, it's different utility for each report.

1189
02:42:55,758 --> 02:42:56,018
[SPEAKER_05]: May I?

1190
02:42:56,418 --> 02:42:56,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1191
02:42:57,539 --> 02:42:58,199
[SPEAKER_14]: Member McLaughlin.

1192
02:42:59,691 --> 02:43:00,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, thank you.

1193
02:43:00,732 --> 02:43:05,135
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it sounds to me like that this is a differentiation tool.

1194
02:43:05,615 --> 02:43:06,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that accurate?

1195
02:43:07,196 --> 02:43:07,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1196
02:43:07,377 --> 02:43:08,217
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a nice way of putting it.

1197
02:43:08,277 --> 02:43:09,058
[SPEAKER_04]: So, exactly.

1198
02:43:09,078 --> 02:43:09,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1199
02:43:09,298 --> 02:43:10,499
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a differentiation tool.

1200
02:43:10,919 --> 02:43:22,267
[SPEAKER_14]: So, which is great because I couldn't agree more that I think that, you know, the district and most districts need a lot of help with differentiation and personalized learning.

1201
02:43:23,308 --> 02:43:29,112
[SPEAKER_14]: So, to that end, in addition to the teachers sort of being able and the data being able to tease out,

1202
02:43:29,724 --> 02:43:42,153
[SPEAKER_14]: the differentiation that's needed, what are we offering around professional development to help support our staff around how to differentiate, which I think is, again, the gist of a lot of what we're hearing in this conversation.

1203
02:43:42,953 --> 02:43:43,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Huge.

1204
02:43:43,934 --> 02:43:46,936
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's something that's going to be growing.

1205
02:43:47,937 --> 02:43:53,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think even from where we started with MAP, to where we are now, to where we need to be,

1206
02:43:56,089 --> 02:44:02,452
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I'm going to just review in a little bit about the instructional, and I don't know where we are.

1207
02:44:02,532 --> 02:44:03,633
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess we can skip around.

1208
02:44:06,214 --> 02:44:06,754
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor, may I?

1209
02:44:07,654 --> 02:44:09,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, Member LaFleur and then Dr. Edward-Vinson.

1210
02:44:09,915 --> 02:44:10,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1211
02:44:10,236 --> 02:44:17,959
[SPEAKER_14]: And I guess that in terms of the differentiation tool too, that's why I think it's so critical when we're disaggregating the data that we're seeing the subgroups, right?

1212
02:44:18,039 --> 02:44:23,922
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the, you know, if you're, we're talking about, you know, MCAS, for example, and we know what our,

1213
02:44:24,881 --> 02:44:29,663
[SPEAKER_14]: for lack of a better word, because I hate the way that it's phrased, but lowest subgroups, right?

1214
02:44:29,683 --> 02:44:37,426
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we're not teasing out those subgroups for differentiation, then that's part of the issue, right?

1215
02:44:37,546 --> 02:44:42,768
[SPEAKER_14]: So we really need to be able to look at that data to be able to disaggregate.

1216
02:44:43,248 --> 02:44:50,491
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's part of what I'm hearing from member Rousseau as well in terms of looking at the individual student, but sort of being able to differentiate.

1217
02:44:50,871 --> 02:44:52,152
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're not just talking about

1218
02:44:52,830 --> 02:44:57,194
[SPEAKER_14]: differentiation of curriculum, we're talking about differentiation of data as well.

1219
02:44:57,695 --> 02:45:03,300
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's really what we need to be able to use to be able to implement the practice of differentiation, right?

1220
02:45:04,001 --> 02:45:04,401
[SPEAKER_14]: Well said.

1221
02:45:04,461 --> 02:45:04,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1222
02:45:07,776 --> 02:45:09,378
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

1223
02:45:09,458 --> 02:45:32,637
[SPEAKER_16]: I just wanted to restate that as I was listening to the conversation that was being had, when I think about the MAP assessment data, it was said earlier at the beginning that this truly is a tool that should be used by the teacher to help inform her instruction

1224
02:45:33,717 --> 02:45:37,279
[SPEAKER_16]: To member McLaughlin's point how she's going to differentiate with students.

1225
02:45:37,819 --> 02:45:49,103
[SPEAKER_16]: I received this exact same parent report for my own child who's in elementary school, and when I've had my parent conference meetings.

1226
02:45:49,583 --> 02:46:03,948
[SPEAKER_16]: where they pull out the, they talk about the quadrants, but they also end up saying, these are the areas where your child has strengths, and these are the areas where you need to continue to monitor and work with your child.

1227
02:46:04,569 --> 02:46:10,371
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, Alexia, ST Math, those, you know, in my

1228
02:46:11,731 --> 02:46:15,956
[SPEAKER_16]: where the braid my daughter is currently in everything is online for homework.

1229
02:46:16,436 --> 02:46:30,110
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's, you know, part of its Lexia part of its math part of its I ready, and they are monitoring the progress, and earlier on, I believe it was Dr Riccadeli talked about.

1230
02:46:31,852 --> 02:46:43,797
[SPEAKER_16]: how some of these supportive programs like ST Math, they adjust Lexia, they adjust to where the child, if you're doing well on the assessment, then you will continue to do well.

1231
02:46:43,837 --> 02:46:46,578
[SPEAKER_16]: They make the adjustments on an individualized basis.

1232
02:46:47,198 --> 02:46:59,383
[SPEAKER_16]: So what is, I almost feel like where we're getting a little caught up is that, yes, a teacher is able to look at that quadrant graph and see where her whole entire class falls,

1233
02:47:00,023 --> 02:47:05,566
[SPEAKER_16]: but she also was able to drill down and see how each student is performing.

1234
02:47:06,327 --> 02:47:24,117
[SPEAKER_16]: And before in Medford, we never had a system or an internal assessment system where we could monitor students' progress across the schools and have it be normed data that we were referencing or using that.

1235
02:47:24,737 --> 02:47:48,386
[SPEAKER_16]: So I do feel like there is a place for NWEA MAP to support instruction and to help teachers be able to say, oh, I am gonna need to spend a little more focused attention or do another mini lesson or a reteach because I had so many students that struggled with the concept or the opposite.

1236
02:47:49,761 --> 02:47:54,522
[SPEAKER_16]: wow, my students are doing fabulous with operations and algebraic thinking.

1237
02:47:54,882 --> 02:48:00,944
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's not an area I can share that data with the students, congratulate them, say pat yourselves on the back.

1238
02:48:01,444 --> 02:48:10,727
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to spend a little bit more time on measurement and data or number and operations and really target it that way.

1239
02:48:11,347 --> 02:48:24,840
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is just to really share with the committee because initially the committee, you know, did ask for demographic data, EL data, special students with disabilities data.

1240
02:48:25,421 --> 02:48:33,189
[SPEAKER_16]: So trying to pull as much data as possible to just share on a global level to say this is where the district is.

1241
02:48:33,789 --> 02:48:43,958
[SPEAKER_16]: but in the opening when the RIT scores were shared to show where is Medford Public Schools in comparison to the nation.

1242
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:56,270
[SPEAKER_16]: And for the most part, we're on par, and in some areas we're outperforming the national RIT scores, and in other areas we are not.

1243
02:48:57,250 --> 02:49:10,136
[SPEAKER_16]: The MCAS data that was shared, where it kind of gives you the predictor of where they think you're going to perform, and then we don't find out until we actually take the MCAS.

1244
02:49:10,876 --> 02:49:17,539
[SPEAKER_16]: So, I feel even that predictive aspect of the NWEA map is really

1245
02:49:19,793 --> 02:49:33,425
[SPEAKER_16]: beneficial because yes, they're saying what students are not meeting expectations, what students are exceeding expectations, and then the students that fall in the meeting and partially meeting.

1246
02:49:34,086 --> 02:49:36,508
[SPEAKER_16]: So it gives you a ballpark.

1247
02:49:36,668 --> 02:49:43,955
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not set in stone, but at least you do have an idea of the direction that you're moving in for the time being.

1248
02:49:44,475 --> 02:50:01,853
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just wanted to say that this really is a tool that should be used and is being used at the school level by the teachers and it can be shared with parents during report card conferences, during SST meetings.

1249
02:50:02,833 --> 02:50:13,497
[SPEAKER_16]: Data might even be taken into some of the IEP meetings or EL meetings, progress report, progress monitoring on English language development.

1250
02:50:13,917 --> 02:50:20,299
[SPEAKER_16]: But I just wanted to stress that this is a tool to help us better gauge where our students are at.

1251
02:50:21,400 --> 02:50:21,800
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1252
02:50:22,280 --> 02:50:23,661
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we're gonna be wrapping up.

1253
02:50:23,781 --> 02:50:24,881
[SPEAKER_07]: So member Graham.

1254
02:50:26,021 --> 02:50:26,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1255
02:50:27,342 --> 02:50:30,063
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to offer maybe a suggestion about

1256
02:50:31,018 --> 02:50:37,203
[SPEAKER_13]: Like I think part of what's happening is there's too much data at the wrong level of detail for this audience.

1257
02:50:37,783 --> 02:50:47,351
[SPEAKER_13]: And so while I would expect other audiences to sort of need and want various like components of data in here, like it's not actionable for this group.

1258
02:50:47,511 --> 02:50:54,756
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just wanted to share like a couple of thoughts and maybe like this can help inform the next presentations.

1259
02:50:55,317 --> 02:50:57,378
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just my, these are just my opinions, but

1260
02:50:58,769 --> 02:51:04,392
[SPEAKER_13]: There's several slides about data observations, and they only talk about the good ones.

1261
02:51:04,972 --> 02:51:07,673
[SPEAKER_13]: They only talk about the places where we're exceeding.

1262
02:51:08,774 --> 02:51:15,878
[SPEAKER_13]: And as we were sitting here, I went through all of the appendix charts.

1263
02:51:16,998 --> 02:51:26,583
[SPEAKER_13]: And my observations are that our black and Latino students are below the national average across the board, all schools, all topics.

1264
02:51:27,546 --> 02:51:31,391
[SPEAKER_13]: Not all places, but lots of places.

1265
02:51:32,632 --> 02:51:42,024
[SPEAKER_13]: In addition to that, at the McGlynn Elementary School, there's something happening in grade three, ELA math and science, all subgroups are sort of noteworthy.

1266
02:51:44,035 --> 02:51:52,900
[SPEAKER_13]: At the Missittuck, math and science are noteworthy, and that means beyond our Black and Latino students, as I talked about being a high-level overall norm.

1267
02:51:53,460 --> 02:51:54,761
[SPEAKER_13]: At the Roberts, it's math.

1268
02:51:56,002 --> 02:51:57,463
[SPEAKER_13]: At the Andrews, it's science.

1269
02:51:57,783 --> 02:51:59,024
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the McGlynn, it's science.

1270
02:51:59,929 --> 02:52:02,630
[SPEAKER_13]: definitely science and ELA.

1271
02:52:03,331 --> 02:52:19,178
[SPEAKER_13]: And so when I look across that, like what I would like to see in the future is like, I absolutely think we should celebrate where we're successful, but I'd also like to see like, what are the five to 10 things where you all are like, these are the things that we saw and this is what we're doing about them.

1272
02:52:19,658 --> 02:52:24,200
[SPEAKER_13]: And so, for example, if it's like a particular grade level at a particular school,

1273
02:52:24,758 --> 02:52:26,259
[SPEAKER_13]: like there's an intervention there.

1274
02:52:26,699 --> 02:52:30,400
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think what we wanna know, what I wanna, I'll speak for myself.

1275
02:52:31,241 --> 02:52:40,185
[SPEAKER_13]: What I wanna know is that you all know what those flash spots are and that you are like working immediately to address them.

1276
02:52:40,405 --> 02:52:49,509
[SPEAKER_13]: And then in the next presentation, you can come back to us and say, we talked about these flash spots, here's what changed.

1277
02:52:49,929 --> 02:52:51,910
[SPEAKER_13]: So if it were my presentation,

1278
02:52:52,529 --> 02:52:59,831
[SPEAKER_13]: I would cut out a lot of the detail that's particularly around the digging into the student dashboards.

1279
02:52:59,931 --> 02:53:01,531
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's super cool and interesting.

1280
02:53:01,591 --> 02:53:11,074
[SPEAKER_13]: But without having access to the tool to be able to do that, I think it suggests more questions than it answers for us, or at least for me.

1281
02:53:11,754 --> 02:53:15,835
[SPEAKER_13]: What I would rather see is, what are those trends, good and bad?

1282
02:53:16,355 --> 02:53:17,495
[SPEAKER_13]: What are the interventions?

1283
02:53:17,635 --> 02:53:18,956
[SPEAKER_13]: And then just the appendices.

1284
02:53:20,174 --> 02:53:22,736
[SPEAKER_13]: make every single one of these charts a heat map.

1285
02:53:23,197 --> 02:53:34,226
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can see green, yellow, red, students who are below the national average in which spots, green, who's above, and then who's like right on the line, either like a little bit above, a little bit below.

1286
02:53:34,746 --> 02:53:43,554
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you can look at it and visually, you know, like there's a lot of green on this chart, or there's a lot of red on this chart, or look at the red, it's all in the same column and across all of these things.

1287
02:53:43,574 --> 02:53:46,096
[SPEAKER_13]: So we haven't, we haven't done enough to move that.

1288
02:53:46,156 --> 02:53:47,637
[SPEAKER_13]: Like, I think there's some like,

1289
02:53:48,064 --> 02:54:02,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Simple visual cues in addition to like putting the district wide number on the on each of the charts, I think that would also be helpful, but I would streamline everything to like highlights problems interventions here's what we're doing here's what's changed and then here's your appendices and.

1290
02:54:04,293 --> 02:54:05,614
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have to keep you here at.

1291
02:54:06,338 --> 02:54:26,572
[SPEAKER_13]: 9pm sort of answering questions that I think in fairness, like, there's nothing we can really do with the information you're providing us, except that, like, as we're going through this, and we have questions like the data needs to be cleaned up so that things add to 100, that all of the subgroups are available, like, that would be my focus for this as you go forward.

1292
02:54:26,972 --> 02:54:35,656
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think even in terms of the district-wide priorities, learning walks, et cetera, et cetera, I think we know all of those things.

1293
02:54:35,676 --> 02:54:37,357
[SPEAKER_13]: We've heard you talk about them all the time.

1294
02:54:37,437 --> 02:54:40,859
[SPEAKER_13]: But I looked at it, and I was like, what's going on in middle school science?

1295
02:54:41,119 --> 02:54:42,620
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have a new curriculum there.

1296
02:54:42,660 --> 02:54:46,602
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we have a problem, or is something else going on?

1297
02:54:47,302 --> 02:54:52,445
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think you can be much more targeted if you're talking about here are the top five things that we're working on district-wide.

1298
02:54:52,825 --> 02:54:58,768
[SPEAKER_13]: at the district level with an assumption, I think, from all of us that, yes, you're meeting with grade level teams.

1299
02:54:58,908 --> 02:55:00,348
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, teachers are using this tool.

1300
02:55:00,469 --> 02:55:03,870
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody's doing their leveling of work.

1301
02:55:04,430 --> 02:55:09,913
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think what we want to know about is, in the aggregate, are we providing the right support to classrooms?

1302
02:55:10,313 --> 02:55:11,713
[SPEAKER_13]: to teachers, to students.

1303
02:55:12,474 --> 02:55:17,755
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think using some of the aggregated data is actually the way for us to know that.

1304
02:55:18,295 --> 02:55:21,776
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think we're a little bit all over the detail map tonight.

1305
02:55:21,836 --> 02:55:26,118
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's why everyone's sort of eyes are drooping.

1306
02:55:26,278 --> 02:55:31,079
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think everyone's sort of feeling frustrated, or at least that's sort of my takeaway.

1307
02:55:31,099 --> 02:55:37,501
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think those small changes would make a big difference in terms of how we can have a productive conversation about it.

1308
02:55:39,162 --> 02:55:39,442
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1309
02:55:41,232 --> 02:55:41,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Member Hays.

1310
02:55:42,914 --> 02:55:43,434
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be brief.

1311
02:55:44,915 --> 02:55:47,297
[SPEAKER_15]: I 100% agree with everything Member Graham just said.

1312
02:55:48,078 --> 02:55:51,961
[SPEAKER_15]: In terms of presentation of data in general, I would say the same thing.

1313
02:55:52,021 --> 02:55:59,968
[SPEAKER_15]: I would apply everything she said to MCAS presentations, to any, you know, any presentations you do of data.

1314
02:56:00,969 --> 02:56:01,790
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to hear

1315
02:56:03,578 --> 02:56:12,621
[SPEAKER_15]: Where things are going well, yes, but we need to hear, as Member Graham said, the areas where things aren't going well and what you're doing about it, because that's where we're gonna make growth.

1316
02:56:14,002 --> 02:56:26,687
[SPEAKER_15]: 1% ahead of the national norm doesn't tell us anything if we don't understand where we're not meeting the norm or where we're not meeting our personal goals and what we're doing to try to get there, because that's where we wanna know what the growth is gonna be.

1317
02:56:27,127 --> 02:56:31,849
[SPEAKER_15]: I would also like to add that in terms of the piece of how classroom teachers use it,

1318
02:56:33,339 --> 02:56:36,920
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to hear from a classroom teacher or several classroom teachers at different levels.

1319
02:56:37,821 --> 02:56:39,902
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to hear them explain how they use it.

1320
02:56:40,042 --> 02:56:41,242
[SPEAKER_15]: They're the ones who are using it.

1321
02:56:41,642 --> 02:56:49,805
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be really helpful to have them walk through, whether they come to a meeting or whether they create videos, however you want to do it.

1322
02:56:49,845 --> 02:56:52,346
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that would be really helpful for us to understand.

1323
02:56:52,746 --> 02:57:00,869
[SPEAKER_15]: Since again, that was the initial reason for purchasing this assessment and using it district wide was to give teachers a tool that they could use

1324
02:57:01,877 --> 02:57:03,738
[SPEAKER_15]: to help in their classroom.

1325
02:57:04,178 --> 02:57:11,581
[SPEAKER_15]: So as much as it's wonderful to hear all of you try to explain it, I think hearing it from the source, hearing it from the people who are using it would be really helpful.

1326
02:57:13,082 --> 02:57:17,584
[SPEAKER_07]: If there's no further questions, I don't know if you want to wrap it up.

1327
02:57:18,164 --> 02:57:26,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to acknowledge, because I think that the input and feedback is not only much appreciated, but we also agree.

1328
02:57:28,223 --> 02:57:50,867
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so part of the work that Paul's now working on is digging into a lot of this data at a much more deeper level so that he will be able to provide the trends and the pieces that you're talking about to school leaders and to department leaders so that they can then have those conversations with the leaders who are doing

1329
02:57:51,664 --> 02:57:53,465
[SPEAKER_05]: also the continuous work.

1330
02:57:53,845 --> 02:58:02,908
[SPEAKER_05]: Paul is meeting with teachers in common planning time and team meetings and staff meetings to go over that, but it's the whole entire district.

1331
02:58:02,968 --> 02:58:09,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the principals and the department directors are doing that work on a consistent basis.

1332
02:58:09,950 --> 02:58:16,492
[SPEAKER_05]: So making sure that we're providing them that drilled down data is something that's happening right now because we agree.

1333
02:58:17,509 --> 02:58:25,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did see those trends, which is why we've shared those trends, because it is something that is on our radar that we are working towards.

1334
02:58:26,155 --> 02:58:33,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And part of that work is going to be the cross-reference of students.

1335
02:58:34,121 --> 02:58:43,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Once we have that drilled down data of the supports that are currently in place, the superintendent mentioned about the SST meetings that have maybe already been happened.
