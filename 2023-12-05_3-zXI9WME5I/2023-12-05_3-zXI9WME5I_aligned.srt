1
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:51,429
and caregivers, so welcome, welcome, welcome to our school committee meeting this evening.

2
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,831
So good evening and happy holidays.

3
00:35:55,811 --> 00:36:03,695
December is here, marking the beginning of the holiday season for many different religious denominations and cultures.

4
00:36:04,755 --> 00:36:12,979
Many members of our local Jewish community will begin the observance of Hanukkah for eight nights beginning this Thursday evening.

5
00:36:14,249 --> 00:36:25,193
Hanukkah, sometimes called the Festival of Lights, is timely and welcome, coinciding with some of the shortest, darkest days of December.

6
00:36:26,853 --> 00:36:34,876
Regardless of your religious beliefs, this is the perfect time to seek some extra light and warmth to your dark evenings.

7
00:36:36,636 --> 00:36:44,281
So we have many wonderful ongoing holiday fundraisers and I just want to take a moment to recognize them.

8
00:36:45,242 --> 00:36:50,965
Our wonderful band members that are here, they are still selling Christmas trees and holiday wreaths.

9
00:36:51,986 --> 00:36:55,811
This, this particular fundraiser is a personal favorite of mine.

10
00:36:55,831 --> 00:37:09,086
I get to pick a tree and with my daughter and pick some leaves and if you can get out there, they're wonderful quality trees and leaves, and I'm not receiving any commission for this wonderful.

11
00:37:10,968 --> 00:37:13,592
Shout out to the band fundraiser, but it is great.

12
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:16,416
It happened this weekend and next weekend.

13
00:37:16,556 --> 00:37:19,560
So Saturday and Sunday come out between 10 and four.

14
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:21,823
You can buy a tree or a wreath.

15
00:37:22,724 --> 00:37:25,648
And it takes place in the Medford High School parking lot.

16
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:34,723
Again, all proceeds will benefit our wonderful award-winning band and color guard team.

17
00:37:35,664 --> 00:37:39,345
Also, we have our sophomore class at the high school.

18
00:37:39,826 --> 00:37:43,307
They're working with modern pastry this holiday season.

19
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:49,089
And again, if you want to avoid the crazy lines in the stores, please put in an order.

20
00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:52,151
I shared the link last week in my Friday memo.

21
00:37:53,772 --> 00:38:00,865
All orders will be accepted until December 14th and all proceeds will support our sophomore class.

22
00:38:02,944 --> 00:38:21,178
Also, just for those of you who are here and for the Medford community at large, if you've been anywhere near the McGlynn Andrews Complex campus, the McGlynn Playground has fencing around it right now, and that's for everyone's safety.

23
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:27,022
So we're really excited because the McGlynn School Playground is going to be

24
00:38:28,496 --> 00:38:32,841
our new universally accessible schoolyard.

25
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:37,987
So there aren't many in Massachusetts, but it's going to be universally accessible.

26
00:38:38,407 --> 00:38:48,659
And I do believe we'll have a lot of visitors from neighboring communities coming to use our new park because it's accessible for all of our young people.

27
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,703
So the construction was originally scheduled to begin in the spring.

28
00:38:55,304 --> 00:39:07,171
However, the timetable got moved up and demolition is going to be taking place this week with the hope of still completing the playground on time.

29
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:09,773
And if we're lucky, they might even finish a little early.

30
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:18,263
So while the construction is taking place, the playground will be closed to the public during construction.

31
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:24,828
That's the sad bit of news I know for our young folk, but it needs to be closed because it's no longer safe.

32
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:29,371
So we do know that it was short notice, but we were given short notice.

33
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:35,256
And as quickly as we found out, we turned around and made sure that we communicated that to the community.

34
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:41,384
So if the McGlynn Playground was your playground of choice, you now have many other options.

35
00:39:41,885 --> 00:39:48,634
Harris Playground, Magoon Playground, Logan, and the newly renovated Morrison Playground.

36
00:39:48,975 --> 00:39:50,778
So there are many other options nearby.

37
00:39:53,246 --> 00:39:55,928
Work will be taking place between 7 a.m.

38
00:39:55,968 --> 00:40:10,096
and 3 p.m., and we are working with the construction company, so we want to make sure that we minimize disruption to arrival and dismissal times when you're dropping off and picking up your children.

39
00:40:10,196 --> 00:40:12,118
So please, you know, keep us in the loop.

40
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:13,138
Let us know.

41
00:40:13,158 --> 00:40:20,723
I do want to extend a very special thank you to our mayor, Brianna Longo Kern, and to the Medford School Committee.

42
00:40:22,117 --> 00:40:24,969
We want to thank City Hall staff, teachers,

43
00:40:27,034 --> 00:40:30,056
our staff in the schools and administrators.

44
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:33,497
We want to thank our family and community partners.

45
00:40:33,957 --> 00:40:48,965
And we also want to thank Shanine Pellequin, who is a parent and a great advocate and expert in the area of playgrounds, lending her expertise to really help us get the best playground possible for our students.

46
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:53,087
So we thank all of you and the community at large for your support.

47
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:57,510
Also, another important update for the community.

48
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,593
It's about our elementary literacy screening.

49
00:41:01,974 --> 00:41:07,619
Elementary caregivers and families are invited to join our assistant superintendent, Ms.

50
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:18,709
Suzanne Galluzzi, over there, and our literacy coach, Kristen Howell, for a presentation on early literacy screening for elementary students.

51
00:41:19,912 --> 00:41:22,233
You may have already received a message from Ms.

52
00:41:22,253 --> 00:41:38,282
Galusi and your student's elementary school about results of your student's screen results and the presentation that will take place will be an excellent presentation and it's going to happen tomorrow, Wednesday,

53
00:41:39,884 --> 00:41:40,985
Tomorrow's Tuesday, correct.

54
00:41:41,405 --> 00:41:44,967
Wednesday, December 6th at 6.30 p.m.

55
00:41:45,967 --> 00:41:47,928
in the McGlynn School Library.

56
00:41:48,188 --> 00:41:53,851
Again, this Wednesday, December 6th at the McGlynn School Library, it's on the second floor.

57
00:41:54,271 --> 00:42:00,495
There will be an in-person presentation to really help families unpack the assessment.

58
00:42:00,915 --> 00:42:01,835
So thank you, Ms.

59
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,216
Galussi, and thank you, Ms.

60
00:42:04,357 --> 00:42:07,178
Howell, for the presentation that you'll be doing this week.

61
00:42:08,607 --> 00:42:13,310
And we just want you to know that administering the early the universal screening.

62
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:21,194
It's crucial to promoting reading success for every child, and we value our partnership with you.

63
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:25,897
Just on a side today I was in a McGlynn school kindergarten classroom.

64
00:42:26,697 --> 00:42:30,061
And I got to see some students reading their early readers.

65
00:42:30,421 --> 00:42:31,462
They were so excited.

66
00:42:31,942 --> 00:42:36,487
I think I was more excited because I'm like, oh, it's only December 4th and you're reading.

67
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:39,650
So our students are doing wonderful things.

68
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:45,915
So have your little ones read to you at home and encourage early literacy and reading.

69
00:42:46,796 --> 00:43:03,001
I also just want our listening audience to know that kindergarten registration, which is critically important for us to have accurate numbers of students that are going to be coming to Medford Public Schools next year, that kindergarten registration is going to begin next month.

70
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:04,542
in January.

71
00:43:05,102 --> 00:43:13,631
So we start in January and it continues for a few months, but if some of you remember, we did have a surprise this summer at the 11th hour.

72
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:25,001
We had a lot of kindergarten students come and register and we were forced to open additional classrooms, you know, with a very, very short turnaround.

73
00:43:25,582 --> 00:43:27,964
So please be on the lookout for those,

74
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:36,139
kindergarten registration opportunities and we will be providing child care and interpretation services.

75
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:39,786
So again, the first event will be taking place on January 16.

76
00:43:43,183 --> 00:43:50,785
There are a few important upcoming events that are going to be happening district-wide.

77
00:43:51,326 --> 00:44:02,649
On December 5th, which is tomorrow, there is a financial planning webinar with the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority at 7 o'clock on Zoom.

78
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:10,817
please go to the Medford High School website, or you can contact Stacey Shulman for additional information.

79
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:25,312
So for juniors, for seniors, parents who wanna find out information, and possibly if you have even a freshman or a sophomore, and you're an early planner, take advantage of this college financial planning webinar.

80
00:44:26,874 --> 00:44:35,861
December 7, as I said earlier, it will mark the first night of Hanukkah, so happy Hanukkah to our Jewish friends, families, and neighbors.

81
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:41,466
December 13 and 14, our wonderful band once again

82
00:44:43,078 --> 00:44:49,282
and our orchestra holiday concerts are gonna be taking place at Medford High School at 7 p.m.

83
00:44:49,582 --> 00:44:58,368
Save the date, mark your calendars, charge your telephones, get ready to take nice pictures and video, record them as well.

84
00:44:58,828 --> 00:45:01,610
So December 13th and 14th, save those dates.

85
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:06,913
So I'm gonna just share with you a quick overview of what's gonna happen this evening.

86
00:45:07,553 --> 00:45:08,054
Tonight,

87
00:45:09,136 --> 00:45:13,881
in addition to welcoming and recognizing our wonderful band and color guard students.

88
00:45:15,302 --> 00:45:27,174
We're also going to hear a wonderful presentation from the Missittuck Elementary School today by Principal Kathleen Kaye, and she's here with her assistant principal, Ms.

89
00:45:27,214 --> 00:45:28,215
Nancy Sherman Hudson.

90
00:45:28,716 --> 00:45:31,839
And we're also gonna hear a wonderful presentation from

91
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:35,442
the principal of the Andrews Middle School principal, Ms.

92
00:45:35,502 --> 00:45:38,784
Jennifer Skane, and her assistant principal, Ms.

93
00:45:38,824 --> 00:45:41,086
Farrah Riley, is here as well.

94
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:46,090
So we look forward to hearing both of your presentations this evening.

95
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:52,135
We're also gonna hear a presentation this evening by Ms.

96
00:45:52,175 --> 00:46:00,362
Galussi, Mr. DeLava, and Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli about our district's NWEA map results.

97
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:04,004
So that's our, again, in-district assessment.

98
00:46:05,504 --> 00:46:12,668
I wanna just go now and recognize, because we're getting ready to tee up for our wonderful band members and color guard.

99
00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:25,694
Last month, our Mustangs placed not third, not second, but first place at the NESBA finals.

100
00:46:25,734 --> 00:46:27,515
Can we give them a round of applause?

101
00:46:29,751 --> 00:46:30,760
We're so proud of you.

102
00:46:38,953 --> 00:46:40,793
They received a platinum medal.

103
00:46:41,574 --> 00:46:55,717
And in addition to being the New England Division II champs, they also took home an award for best music, best visual, best overall effect, and best color guard.

104
00:46:56,277 --> 00:46:59,838
This is a first in Medford band history.

105
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:07,240
And as a community, we're so proud to celebrate these exemplary Mustang musicians and performers.

106
00:47:07,581 --> 00:47:09,339
Can we give them one more round of applause?

107
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:34,132
So, in recognition of this huge accomplishment, we're very pleased to present each of our students with a certificate on behalf of the entire Mustang community.

108
00:47:34,812 --> 00:47:36,093
Many thanks to Ms.

109
00:47:36,133 --> 00:47:39,454
Haley Weller, Coordinator of Fine Arts and Band Director,

110
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:40,755
and Ms.

111
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:56,927
Jackie Gaffney, assistant band director, for their hard work in supporting the band program, and our deepest gratitude to the parents, caregivers, and families of our band and color guard students for being their biggest fans and boosters.

112
00:47:57,327 --> 00:47:59,168
So thank you to all of you.

113
00:47:59,188 --> 00:48:09,236
At this time, I'd like to present with Mayor Wendell Kern, each student with their certificate, and then we'll figure out a way to take a photo

114
00:48:09,776 --> 00:48:11,597
with the entire school committee.

115
00:48:12,197 --> 00:48:22,499
So please hold your applause if you can until all the names have been read, because I do believe we have 48 wonderful students to recognize.

116
00:48:30,762 --> 00:48:32,182
Elijah Adamink.

117
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:38,584
I apologize.

118
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:46,455
just to go down, or let them go?

119
00:48:46,475 --> 00:48:48,757
I think it's microphones, so.

120
00:48:48,777 --> 00:48:49,497
Okay, let me copy that.

121
00:48:49,517 --> 00:48:49,777
Thank you.

122
00:48:49,797 --> 00:48:50,958
Congratulations.

And Stanley Tang.

And Sarah Youssef.

178
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:59,339
Maria, I apologize.

179
00:58:01,781 --> 00:58:03,461
Quick round of applause for our superintendent.

180
00:58:10,499 --> 00:58:12,661
And to our band and color guard.

181
00:58:19,726 --> 00:58:22,728
You guys want to come up here?

182
00:58:22,748 --> 00:58:24,910
We should get up here.

183
00:58:25,771 --> 00:58:26,731
Oh, all seven of us.

184
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:27,192
Okay.

185
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:30,254
You want to come right in here?

186
00:58:32,115 --> 00:58:33,396
Well, first you three come this way.

187
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:34,397
There's a lift.

188
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,681
You can come up here so that we can.

189
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:47,103
Band members, come inside.

190
00:58:47,403 --> 00:58:48,123
Come right in here.

191
00:58:50,564 --> 00:58:52,485
Band and color guard, right down here.

192
00:58:52,505 --> 00:59:00,087
Erica, come on up.

193
00:59:00,127 --> 00:59:00,867
Yeah, come this way.

194
00:59:13,557 --> 00:59:14,338
Yeah, right in front.

195
00:59:14,398 --> 00:59:15,279
Cover that camera.

196
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:15,800
Yep.

197
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,361
Tall people in the back.

198
00:59:17,862 --> 00:59:20,024
Can have a row of people kneeling.

199
00:59:44,325 --> 00:59:46,357
I don't know why it's off of the microphone.

200
01:03:24,369 --> 01:03:24,710
Yeah.

201
01:04:03,629 --> 01:04:10,815
Thank you, Superintendent, for your updates, and congratulations again to the Mustang Marching Band and our Color Guard.

202
01:04:11,595 --> 01:04:17,239
I'd like to welcome school committee elect, Erica Reinfeld and Aaron Olopade.

203
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,220
Thanks for joining us.

204
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:23,644
I know you'll probably be here tonight and on the 18th, so two meetings to get right in in January, right?

205
01:04:24,245 --> 01:04:24,585
Welcome.

206
01:04:25,025 --> 01:04:26,927
I'm not sure if we have any student representatives.

207
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:27,868
Dr. Cushing?

208
01:04:28,548 --> 01:04:28,848
Not yet.

209
01:04:29,069 --> 01:04:29,429
We don't know.

210
01:04:29,569 --> 01:04:29,789
Okay.

211
01:04:30,329 --> 01:04:31,731
But I just wanted to say hello if we did.

212
01:04:31,751 --> 01:04:32,851
So thank you.

213
01:04:34,016 --> 01:04:39,397
Next up, we have number three, Misatoch Elementary School and Andrews Middle School updates.

214
01:04:39,437 --> 01:04:39,637
Yes.

215
01:04:39,977 --> 01:04:42,377
We skipped over item five, the consent agenda.

216
01:04:42,397 --> 01:04:45,178
It was on the front page.

217
01:04:46,538 --> 01:04:46,898
Oh, jeez.

218
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:49,559
My apologies.

219
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:54,119
Revert back to the regular order of business to consent agenda.

220
01:04:54,139 --> 01:04:59,180
We have bills and payrolls and regular school committee meeting minutes from November 20th, 2023.

221
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:03,261
Is there a motion for approval of the consent agenda?

222
01:05:04,895 --> 01:05:07,576
Motion for approval by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Kretz.

223
01:05:07,676 --> 01:05:08,517
All those in favor?

224
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:09,117
Aye.

225
01:05:09,517 --> 01:05:10,498
All those opposed?

226
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,119
Consent agenda is approved.

227
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:17,662
Now to number three under report of superintendent.

228
01:05:17,762 --> 01:05:22,244
It's number, the Missittuck Elementary School and Andrews Middle School updates.

229
01:05:22,284 --> 01:05:23,525
We have Ms.

230
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:26,126
Kathy Kay, Missittuck principal, and Ms.

231
01:05:26,146 --> 01:05:29,228
Jennifer Skane, Andrews Middle School principal.

232
01:05:29,548 --> 01:05:29,888
Welcome.

233
01:05:30,408 --> 01:05:33,950
Come on up one at a time or both together depending on how you have it planned.

234
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,519
Yes, Missituck is first.

235
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,700
And Ms.

236
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,981
Sherman-Hudson, you're more than welcome to... She's here.

237
01:05:46,021 --> 01:05:47,261
Thank you for being here tonight.

238
01:05:48,702 --> 01:06:05,546
So thank you so much for inviting me to show all the things that have happened at the Missituck and are planned to happen moving forward, none of which would be possible without the amazing PTO that the Missituck has, as well as the dedicated staff that work at the Missituck Elementary School.

239
01:06:05,987 --> 01:06:11,009
And so one of which is here, Mr. Sherman Hudson, who is my right and left hand, sometimes my toes when needed.

240
01:06:11,669 --> 01:06:13,970
And also David Nguyen came with me.

241
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:17,991
He is on the Mississippi School Council, so he's going to support tonight.

242
01:06:18,291 --> 01:06:21,112
So thank you so much, and I hope you like what you see.

243
01:06:22,093 --> 01:06:24,033
There's our school, and here's what's happening.

244
01:06:24,854 --> 01:06:29,655
So we always start the year off with our kickboard and playground.

245
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:34,797
And on August 22nd, the kids are getting out there, and usually they're never

246
01:06:37,177 --> 01:06:38,540
Our ETO runs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

247
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:45,443
How's that?

248
01:06:45,703 --> 01:06:45,883
Yes.

249
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:51,966
Okay, so they get to meet one another once again, just to kind of get reacquainted and have some fun on the playground.

250
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:57,129
And again, you're going to hear me say Missittuck PTO quite a lot because they really help us in amazing ways.

251
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:03,432
One exciting thing we did at the Missittuck last spring was we did a pilot screening program.

252
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:06,494
So the students who had registered for kindergarten

253
01:07:07,354 --> 01:07:09,256
came in and they were able to meet with teachers.

254
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:12,119
So we were able to do that screening before school began.

255
01:07:12,579 --> 01:07:14,421
And it really did help us with placement.

256
01:07:14,461 --> 01:07:18,384
There are many days that Mr. Sherman Hudson and I say, wow, we're really glad we did this.

257
01:07:18,424 --> 01:07:22,348
So I would strongly recommend if we could do it moving forward, two thumbs up.

258
01:07:23,747 --> 01:07:30,409
The next event we did on September 8, and this is where normally we do it in the gym, but it was a really, really hot day.

259
01:07:30,869 --> 01:07:40,873
So we went out onto the playground, the whole entire school, kindergarten through fifth grade, and the teachers circled around the students out on our blacktop area.

260
01:07:41,293 --> 01:07:47,495
And then what the teachers do, because I want the students to know everybody in the building, and so they introduced the person to their left.

261
01:07:48,115 --> 01:07:51,237
So that teacher then has to kind of say hello and get acquainted again.

262
01:07:51,257 --> 01:07:53,399
And they've already done that because it was September 8th.

263
01:07:53,799 --> 01:07:58,142
But they tell something nice about that person to the whole student body.

264
01:07:58,382 --> 01:07:59,923
And so as you can see, they're laughing.

265
01:08:00,103 --> 01:08:00,784
They were having a good time.

266
01:08:01,424 --> 01:08:05,167
We passed around a megaphone and hardly anyone wanted to use it.

267
01:08:05,327 --> 01:08:07,908
So there were teachers who didn't need it, but there were some who did.

268
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:14,253
Then in September, the PTO helps us organize our Ice Cream Social.

269
01:08:14,693 --> 01:08:16,154
So it's the PTO Ice Cream Social.

270
01:08:16,744 --> 01:08:25,547
And as you can see, we have, well, when the slide changes, hopefully soon, you can see that they have parents who help serve ice cream.

271
01:08:25,627 --> 01:08:29,169
And a lot of our students who went to the Mississippi come back almost every year.

272
01:08:30,089 --> 01:08:32,470
We kind of urge them, you can have free ice cream if you come as well.

273
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:34,291
So that usually works out well.

274
01:08:34,691 --> 01:08:35,851
And then you can see they're having fun.

275
01:08:35,891 --> 01:08:39,733
And that was me in the middle, I took a selfie with some of the kids with my big, huge camera.

276
01:08:39,753 --> 01:08:40,633
So they got a kick out of that.

277
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:43,414
And then the PTO sets up where they can do like a photo booth.

278
01:08:43,814 --> 01:08:45,195
So I usually have a lot of fun there as well.

279
01:08:46,345 --> 01:08:50,046
The next event that took place was on October 4, we do two a year.

280
01:08:50,466 --> 01:08:53,447
And I do believe a lot of the other schools participate in this as well.

281
01:08:54,467 --> 01:08:56,928
In October, it's a national walk, ride to school day.

282
01:08:56,948 --> 01:08:59,948
And again, the PTO gets really involved.

283
01:09:00,408 --> 01:09:06,850
They what we do to get all the students involved who want to be is I go around the corner, and I meet the kids on the bus.

284
01:09:08,015 --> 01:09:24,052
They get off the bus and then they walk up the street we have parent volunteers to make sure everyone's safe to have a little bit of a walk and then what the PTO does is they write, but you can see, I'm going to say it wrong I'm sure Wayne trabajo on the ground in Spanish and Portuguese to kind of welcome those kids into, you know,

285
01:09:24,432 --> 01:09:26,093
celebrating our diversity at our school.

286
01:09:26,633 --> 01:09:32,415
And then the PTO waits at the school, and they kind of have the kids sign in their name and their teacher's name.

287
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:37,976
And then what they do is they decide, well, they count up, and by the end of the day, they let me know which class had the most participants.

288
01:09:38,296 --> 01:09:43,778
So they get the Golden Shoe Award, which you can see is one of the child's old sneakers that they just painted gold.

289
01:09:44,258 --> 01:09:45,839
But the kids really like it.

290
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:49,240
And Mrs. Schrammowitz's class, fourth grade, they were the winners this year.

291
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,240
So I took a picture of them.

292
01:09:51,847 --> 01:09:56,152
In October, we did a story night and a PTO book fair.

293
01:09:56,572 --> 01:09:58,234
This one was by Scholastic.

294
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:04,441
And you can see the amount of the total sales that we made quite a lot, over $9,000, almost 10.

295
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:08,044
And then some of that money comes back to us in Scholastic dollars.

296
01:10:08,105 --> 01:10:11,608
So sometimes the PTO will buy rugs or

297
01:10:12,749 --> 01:10:16,533
the movable chairs or even just books for the library, using those PTO dollars.

298
01:10:17,014 --> 01:10:31,148
And then on the same evening we had teachers, high school students, Mrs. Ingrid Moncada, who was here before, and we read stories to the children who came to our rooms in English, Portuguese, Haitian, Creole, and Spanish.

299
01:10:34,312 --> 01:10:52,962
The next event we had was on October 25, and this was a pilot program at our school that was brought to me by Hendrick Gideons, and he visited with me over the summer, and we planned it out where he's doing this not-for-profit organization called Down by the Riverside, and the email address is there if anybody wants to check it out.

300
01:10:53,763 --> 01:10:59,626
And he has partnered up with Willie J. Laws, who is a black veteran

301
01:11:00,266 --> 01:11:02,150
and he's a lifetime blues musician.

302
01:11:02,431 --> 01:11:08,142
He grew up in Texas and he tours all over the nation, but he has settled here in Massachusetts.

303
01:11:09,093 --> 01:11:16,560
What he did was with Mr. Gideons, they gave two 45 minute sessions so the entire school was able to participate.

304
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:22,807
They focused on using music as a way to create connections between people and our communities.

305
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:31,635
And so Mr. Laws also shared his own experiences at being a master performer in an intimate setting within our school and Mr. Gideons also sent me a

306
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:41,021
link of some of that program but it was four minutes long and it also came today so I shared with Dr. Edward Vincent if she wants to share it with you then you can take a look at that.

307
01:11:42,482 --> 01:11:48,105
In October, many of you are already aware, I usually invite you every year to come to the school to read to the classes.

308
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:50,095
for Jumpstart Read for the Record.

309
01:11:50,376 --> 01:11:52,976
I've been looking daily to see if the record has been broken yet.

310
01:11:52,996 --> 01:11:56,597
They're giving me lots of other email, but I haven't found out yet.

311
01:11:57,438 --> 01:12:00,559
It's become such a big organization that I don't know that we break the record anymore.

312
01:12:01,759 --> 01:12:08,241
But it's a lot of fun because the community members come in and they read to our lower students, and then the upper students read to the kids in the middle grades.

313
01:12:08,561 --> 01:12:11,042
And then I run around like a crazy person and I take pictures.

314
01:12:11,422 --> 01:12:15,043
So you can see some of the famous people who participated this year.

315
01:12:15,163 --> 01:12:18,284
And the book was With Lots of Love by Jenny Sanchez Torres.

316
01:12:18,795 --> 01:12:20,256
And I think the kids really enjoyed it.

317
01:12:20,276 --> 01:12:22,137
So thank you for everyone who volunteered their time.

318
01:12:22,477 --> 01:12:25,498
And to those of you who couldn't, I understand, busy lives.

319
01:12:26,859 --> 01:12:35,223
So one of the things that I've been doing for the past 12 years, because this is my 12th year at the Mississippi slash Columbus Elementary School, we do weekly awards.

320
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,684
We call them works of wonder.

321
01:12:37,544 --> 01:12:41,106
I no longer post them as www because I got an email from a company in

322
01:12:42,366 --> 01:12:43,867
England who said that that was trademarked.

323
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,168
But if I called it works of wonder we were good to go.

324
01:12:46,348 --> 01:12:47,209
So that's what we do.

325
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:56,834
Basically what happens is every week, Mrs. Sherman Hudson and I run around, the teachers submit something wonderful that a child has done, and they just go, well, that was really good.

326
01:12:57,294 --> 01:13:00,736
And so we give them a certificate, we give them a crazy little handshake and a pencil.

327
01:13:01,471 --> 01:13:02,211
And the kids smile.

328
01:13:02,372 --> 01:13:04,153
They really, really smile from ear to ear.

329
01:13:04,633 --> 01:13:07,375
And sometimes they'll say, wow, this is my fifth one.

330
01:13:07,475 --> 01:13:09,196
And they're just so excited and proud to get it.

331
01:13:09,236 --> 01:13:10,236
It hangs on the refrigerator.

332
01:13:10,316 --> 01:13:12,738
And we do give them to staff and community members as well.

333
01:13:12,778 --> 01:13:14,799
So you may have been on the receiving end of those.

334
01:13:14,839 --> 01:13:17,741
And if you have, thank you for whatever you've done for the Mississippi.

335
01:13:18,541 --> 01:13:20,962
We also do a monthly called Conduct and Citizenship.

336
01:13:21,483 --> 01:13:22,864
And those are for the students who

337
01:13:23,999 --> 01:13:32,211
stand out just a little bit further by being responsible, respectful, and safe, following the school rules as often as they can throughout the month.

338
01:13:32,731 --> 01:13:37,097
And so the teacher submits one child, so there are 10 winners a year, and they get things like a ribbon.

339
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:39,481
They get to cut the lunch line if they're getting school lunch.

340
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,463
They sit on the stage with myself and some friends.

341
01:13:42,503 --> 01:13:43,243
We play games.

342
01:13:43,363 --> 01:13:44,104
I get to know them.

343
01:13:44,805 --> 01:13:45,726
And I take a picture.

344
01:13:45,786 --> 01:13:46,927
I post it to the website.

345
01:13:48,048 --> 01:13:49,850
And they get to help us pick the next Spirit Day.

346
01:13:50,010 --> 01:13:51,672
So it kind of takes a little bit of the pressure off me.

347
01:13:51,752 --> 01:13:53,113
Nancy and I count the votes.

348
01:13:53,794 --> 01:13:54,875
This one's going to be Pajama Day.

349
01:13:54,895 --> 01:13:56,737
Anybody who wants to participate, it's the end of December.

350
01:13:58,229 --> 01:14:05,594
This year for the first time, which I do have to admit I heard at another school's meeting, we did PTO trunk and treat.

351
01:14:06,234 --> 01:14:13,479
And what the PTO did was they invited family members to decorate their cars and their trunks and dress up in costumes and offer candy to the kids.

352
01:14:13,979 --> 01:14:19,903
And over 200 people came from the Missittuck and the greater community to trick or treat in the Missittuck parking lot.

353
01:14:20,063 --> 01:14:21,504
And the kids had a great time.

354
01:14:23,134 --> 01:14:30,264
The PTO also supports cultural events every year with the amazing help of Mrs. Christina McGordy.

355
01:14:30,304 --> 01:14:32,447
She pretty much organizes this for everybody.

356
01:14:32,528 --> 01:14:38,016
And as you can see on the list of events, every grade has at least one that has come in.

357
01:14:39,126 --> 01:14:42,707
The Afro-Brazilian martial arts, music, and dance came for the whole school.

358
01:14:43,207 --> 01:14:44,607
And they did two sessions again.

359
01:14:44,707 --> 01:14:49,928
And I'm really glad that they did not ask me to come up on stage and try that with them, as you can see in the picture.

360
01:14:50,648 --> 01:14:51,729
I wouldn't have been able to do that.

361
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:57,070
Curious Creatures came in not that long ago on the 17th of November for kindergarten.

362
01:14:58,050 --> 01:15:01,330
And in the picture, you can see that Jabari has a snake around his neck.

363
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:02,071
That's real.

364
01:15:03,131 --> 01:15:04,451
They passed around it, well,

365
01:15:04,923 --> 01:15:05,784
They didn't pass around.

366
01:15:05,924 --> 01:15:09,028
The person from Curious Creatures held the animals.

367
01:15:09,689 --> 01:15:11,011
But the kids were able to touch a turtle.

368
01:15:11,391 --> 01:15:13,554
That's a ferret that Jack has in his hand.

369
01:15:13,934 --> 01:15:17,218
And then in the left corner, you can kind of see that's not the turtle's head.

370
01:15:17,659 --> 01:15:20,262
That was a bearded dragon she put on the turtle's back.

371
01:15:20,763 --> 01:15:23,867
And it wouldn't stay on, but it kind of made a pretty cool picture, I thought.

372
01:15:25,883 --> 01:15:28,205
Right before Thanksgiving, two of our classes, Ms.

373
01:15:28,225 --> 01:15:28,925
Changelian and Ms.

374
01:15:28,965 --> 01:15:32,228
Penta, they did a famsgiving celebration.

375
01:15:32,688 --> 01:15:40,473
And so they invited the parents to come in, or grandparents, whoever could come, with their own food so we didn't have to worry about any allergies or anything like that.

376
01:15:40,854 --> 01:15:45,237
They sat down at a really big table and they just shared their snack and then just celebrated.

377
01:15:45,257 --> 01:15:49,780
The kids made placemats for their parents and told what they were thankful for and it was really a sweet, sweet event.

378
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:56,712
Again, the Mississauga PTO sponsors so many things at our school, and here's a list of some of them.

379
01:15:57,092 --> 01:15:59,973
Book fairs, we've already had one, there'll be another one, Porter Square.

380
01:16:00,534 --> 01:16:11,498
This year, for the first time, we are doing closed caption in our PTO virtual meetings, and they've chosen, you can only do one language, so they've chosen Portuguese, because that tends to be the largest population of speakers in our school.

381
01:16:12,182 --> 01:16:13,643
And many of the others are listed.

382
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:16,984
We did have our Village Craft Fair this Saturday, which was wonderful.

383
01:16:17,344 --> 01:16:20,286
And I'm happy to say I'm almost done with my Christmas shopping.

384
01:16:20,326 --> 01:16:21,206
Thank you to the PTO.

385
01:16:21,566 --> 01:16:22,867
Once again, they helped me in my life.

386
01:16:24,027 --> 01:16:28,509
The Who's Reading is always a wonderful event, and it's always very well-participated, so that's exciting, too.

387
01:16:28,589 --> 01:16:32,331
And then, you know, a lot of schools do Teach Appreciation Day or week.

388
01:16:32,851 --> 01:16:35,252
PTO does a month, so that's pretty spectacular.

389
01:16:36,684 --> 01:16:39,629
The BTO also helps fund field trips that we go on.

390
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:44,215
And so I just listed for you some of the places that the school will be going on.

391
01:16:44,296 --> 01:16:47,841
Again, they help pay for at least one trip for every grade level.

392
01:16:47,921 --> 01:16:49,664
And so you'll see that everyone's represented there.

393
01:16:52,352 --> 01:16:56,637
And then, of course, the district is offering us many training opportunities this year.

394
01:16:56,657 --> 01:17:10,613
And again, you'll see the list, bullying, Hill for Literacy, EPRI training, HMH, that's our new reading program, literacy coaching, data analysis with the help of Mr. Paul DeLiva, which I'm so happy he's housed in my building, the science of reading, and then ST Math.

395
01:17:11,843 --> 01:17:14,604
And so on the next page, I just thought it might be fun to see a picture of Gigi.

396
01:17:15,684 --> 01:17:18,565
Mrs. Cara Bates is going to be our ST Math champion.

397
01:17:18,965 --> 01:17:26,187
So she's going to be creating a bulletin board in the library, because the kids go there all the time, so they can see their stats and how far they're going.

398
01:17:26,727 --> 01:17:29,247
It's a spatial temporal program.

399
01:17:29,767 --> 01:17:34,229
And it helps the children use their reasoning to solve mathematical problems.

400
01:17:34,749 --> 01:17:35,709
And they use it in class.

401
01:17:36,329 --> 01:17:37,471
And they can use it at home.

402
01:17:37,671 --> 01:17:39,735
And then last year, Gigi was supposed to come.

403
01:17:39,775 --> 01:17:41,457
It was going to be a costume that I was going to put on.

404
01:17:41,838 --> 01:17:44,122
So it didn't happen, but hopefully that'll happen this year.

405
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:49,951
And I think what we're going to try and do is get a little Gigi stuffed animal, and then the class who has them, so we can kind of pass that around, like the sneaker.

406
01:17:51,567 --> 01:17:53,168
And then we have more events that are coming.

407
01:17:53,248 --> 01:17:57,071
They haven't happened yet, but we'll have our winter concert, which we always video record.

408
01:17:57,592 --> 01:17:59,653
This year at the Missittuck, we're going to try something new.

409
01:17:59,733 --> 01:18:04,057
We're going to call it a, I don't know, we might change the name, but basically it's a specialist showcase.

410
01:18:04,657 --> 01:18:12,303
So the gym teacher will be there, the art teacher, the music teacher, the Nexus teacher, and the librarian.

411
01:18:12,323 --> 01:18:14,044
I feel like I'm forgetting somebody.

412
01:18:15,005 --> 01:18:20,509
They'll just kind of show the families some of the things that they may have done throughout the year that the children are learning in their classes.

413
01:18:20,549 --> 01:18:21,430
And that will be in the spring.

414
01:18:22,432 --> 01:18:24,273
There'll be a spring walk bike to school.

415
01:18:24,473 --> 01:18:31,617
We always have a fifth grade volleyball game, students versus the teachers and the students don't always win, but most of the time they do.

416
01:18:32,377 --> 01:18:38,841
We do a fun day that again, the PTO helps really fund and support with their man, woman, person power.

417
01:18:39,461 --> 01:18:42,783
And the PTO does an end of the year dance party, which is always a lot of fun for the kids.

418
01:18:42,803 --> 01:18:44,624
So thank you for listening.

419
01:18:45,184 --> 01:18:46,745
And does anybody have any questions?

420
01:18:46,765 --> 01:18:47,405
Thank you very much.

421
01:18:47,565 --> 01:18:49,106
Thank you.

422
01:18:49,126 --> 01:18:50,347
We appreciate the presentation.

423
01:18:50,487 --> 01:18:50,687
Yes.

424
01:18:58,081 --> 01:19:00,143
Good evening.

425
01:19:00,243 --> 01:19:00,943
Good evening.

426
01:19:01,904 --> 01:19:07,168
If I put these on I can see you, but I can't see this.

427
01:19:07,268 --> 01:19:07,848
So thank you.

428
01:19:07,888 --> 01:19:08,449
Good evening.

429
01:19:09,409 --> 01:19:15,394
So it's kind of fitting that I'm here this evening because today is actually my 90th work day in the district.

430
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:34,061
And I'm pleased to say that it has been an amazing, rewarding experience getting to know all of the MedFit public school systems and students and families.

431
01:19:34,321 --> 01:19:41,270
And I am eager to continue that work with staff and families in order to make a positive difference in the community.

432
01:19:44,597 --> 01:19:46,598
So I just started out with some numbers.

433
01:19:47,718 --> 01:19:51,160
Our current enrollment is about 455 students.

434
01:19:52,140 --> 01:19:56,902
We've seen a lot of students join us at the start of the school year, transferring to our school.

435
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:05,746
And we've had some success in making sure that they transition successfully through support of our guidance program.

436
01:20:06,126 --> 01:20:09,348
And we're looking to even start a student

437
01:20:10,066 --> 01:20:14,931
mentor program where students can help mentor students that are starting at our school.

438
01:20:17,113 --> 01:20:20,276
Our honor roll for this first quarter, it was pretty amazing.

439
01:20:20,556 --> 01:20:31,327
And if you add up all that numbers and do the math, it's about 76% of our students made honor roll, either honors or high honors this particular quarter.

440
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:48,330
Our teachers, we have 60 educators, either core educators, exploratory teachers, physical education, special education teachers, and then we have about 20 support staff.

441
01:20:48,350 --> 01:20:50,271
So those are our counselors, et cetera.

442
01:20:50,751 --> 01:20:53,914
And I have to say that I think I have one of the best staff in the district.

443
01:21:00,387 --> 01:21:03,369
So in the classroom, we've been pretty active in the classroom.

444
01:21:10,234 --> 01:21:11,214
Oh, I didn't do attendance.

445
01:21:11,274 --> 01:21:11,715
I'm sorry.

446
01:21:12,015 --> 01:21:13,556
Let me just add that we do have 95.4.

447
01:21:13,596 --> 01:21:16,158
I'm ready to get that up over that 95 so I can highlight up to 96.

448
01:21:22,247 --> 01:21:22,927
That's my goal.

449
01:21:22,967 --> 01:21:28,408
I would like to get 96% attendance by the end of the school year and then maybe even increase that next year.

450
01:21:28,448 --> 01:21:28,828
We'll see.

451
01:21:29,568 --> 01:21:38,030
Um, so yes, uh, attendance and, um, very excited to say at least 133 students had perfect attendance.

452
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:39,950
So that's pretty amazing.

453
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:49,172
Um, so in the classroom, um, our students have been working pretty hard at learning some new skills, taking the skills they've already learned,

454
01:21:49,781 --> 01:21:53,943
So I just highlighted a few of the things that we have done in 7B.

455
01:21:54,563 --> 01:22:02,427
Our students in our social studies curriculum did a compare and contrast essay in Ms.

456
01:22:02,587 --> 01:22:18,094
O'Donohue's class, and they had to take countries' literacy skills and different points of research for different countries, and then they had to compare and contrast

457
01:22:18,775 --> 01:22:21,557
And they did this over a multi-unit lesson.

458
01:22:22,077 --> 01:22:27,600
And then the students were actually able to post their lessons in one of the bulletin boards in the main lobby.

459
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:35,024
And students could select, if they wanted to, to identify themselves to their colleagues and other students.

460
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:41,107
So many of the students did choose to put their names on their paper and identify their hard work.

461
01:22:41,147 --> 01:22:42,368
So that was pretty exciting.

462
01:22:42,928 --> 01:22:46,370
For Veterans Day, our students in Mr. Tremonti's class

463
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:50,010
worked on the entire school all week.

464
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:59,051
We had done some what does Veterans Day mean and try and highlight the different aspects of what Veterans Day incorporates.

465
01:22:59,591 --> 01:23:09,993
And then one of the culminating was that students were invited through Operation Gratitude to write letters to veterans members and current members serving in the military.

466
01:23:10,013 --> 01:23:15,594
I'm pleased to say we sent out 98 letters that will be sent off to current

467
01:23:17,156 --> 01:23:25,340
military members, and we also, students decided to make some poppies and decorated one of the boards in the main lobby.

468
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:31,744
So those are there highlighting some of our current staff members, family members who are also veterans.

469
01:23:31,804 --> 01:23:32,785
So that's pretty nice.

470
01:23:34,145 --> 01:23:40,529
We also, I know Kathy mentioned ST Math, so we're pretty excited that

471
01:23:41,352 --> 01:24:07,584
We have a grant that is allowing for 75 math licenses for our eighth grade students, and the district is gonna pick up the additional so that all of our eighth grade students can use ST Math, which is a conceptual math program where students will be able to use that to not only build in some remediation skills, but also enrichment if they are ready to extend their learning.

472
01:24:11,389 --> 01:24:12,249
What else we got?

473
01:24:12,830 --> 01:24:13,571
It's all too little.

474
01:24:18,355 --> 01:24:23,300
So the pictures on the right are our Global Scholars Program.

475
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:27,884
So Global Scholars is an opportunity for our 7th grade

476
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:33,932
civic students to have the opportunity to work with students from all over the world.

477
01:24:34,472 --> 01:24:46,857
They decide on a topic of interest and then they work with students about how they might solve that problem, utilizing different cultures and different techniques from all over the world.

478
01:24:46,937 --> 01:24:53,679
So they may be on a Zoom conference with students in Spain or, you know,

479
01:24:54,443 --> 01:25:13,949
another country, and then the woman, Natalie Boyo, from the wildlife came in and spoke to our students, and they went out on a walk, and they looked at the Mystic River watershed, and they're incorporating that into their problem that they're solving this year, so that's pretty exciting as well.

480
01:25:13,969 --> 01:25:16,750
Next slide.

481
01:25:18,368 --> 01:25:32,715
So when I started at the Andrews, I met with parents, I met with staff members, I met with families, I met with students, and I also met with other administrators from across the district.

482
01:25:33,316 --> 01:25:45,162
Two things that were highly encouraged for me was to build fun and enrichment opportunities for the students and also increase communication.

483
01:25:45,683 --> 01:25:59,946
So two of the things that I have done is we have a weekly newsletter that we post and I send to all families on Friday evening, just kind of highlighting what the students are doing or what's coming up for them.

484
01:26:01,026 --> 01:26:07,408
Also, you know, we put in there all of our PTO events because we have a very strong PTO.

485
01:26:09,069 --> 01:26:12,731
The PTO, I feel like I lost a page here.

486
01:26:12,931 --> 01:26:16,513
The PTO has had several successful events so far this year.

487
01:26:16,533 --> 01:26:23,818
We had a pie fundraiser, which I have to say I got the chocolate intensity pie for Thanksgiving.

488
01:26:24,098 --> 01:26:25,539
It was to die for.

489
01:26:26,379 --> 01:26:33,043
And we're doing a gut sneakers fundraiser and a donation campaign.

490
01:26:34,423 --> 01:26:46,787
also had an opportunity to host a family night where Kevin, a gentleman who runs lots of families, we played family feud, and we played bingo, and the kids had a lot of fun.

491
01:26:47,847 --> 01:26:50,107
And I lost but that's okay.

492
01:26:51,448 --> 01:26:57,450
So and then tonight we had a restaurant night at the Ford Tavern and we have one tomorrow night too.

493
01:26:57,930 --> 01:27:02,511
And obviously all of these events are to raise funds to help support some of the

494
01:27:03,455 --> 01:27:12,180
enrichment opportunities, as well as the other thing that I was asked to bring back, which is field trips and dances.

495
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:18,103
So we've already had, I feel like I missed something here.

496
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:22,732
Thank you.

497
01:27:22,892 --> 01:27:34,801
Okay, so and then we had curriculum night at the start of the year, which we invited students to come and help serve as leaders for the school so that they would help show the parents around the school.

498
01:27:35,221 --> 01:27:38,103
The students really enjoyed that opportunity to step up.

499
01:27:38,183 --> 01:27:42,466
They showed their pride in their school to their families as well.

500
01:27:42,506 --> 01:27:43,367
So that was really fun.

501
01:27:43,942 --> 01:27:54,749
Some of the pictures you see here, the item on the bottom was that we decided that we would ask people to bring their desserts to family night, and we asked them to bring something from their culture.

502
01:27:55,649 --> 01:28:05,916
So we got to try lots of different cultural desserts that evening, and I had some Brazilian chocolate balls, which I have to say, I asked her if I could have some for Christmas.

503
01:28:06,376 --> 01:28:06,896
Next slide.

504
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:27,175
So student activities, we are very lucky to say that we have had such a high turnout for students that want to be involved in our student activities, that at the start of the year, with several of our advisors, I had to do some planning with them.

505
01:28:27,255 --> 01:28:30,076
How would we fit all those students safely?

506
01:28:30,496 --> 01:28:40,020
Volleyball, we had about 120 students turn out, and we were like, we can't do that in one particular afternoon, so we had to do it by grade every other week.

507
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:50,926
We've just had a new staff member start at our school, so I'm pleased to say that we're going to have our own Andrews Middle School GSA club that starts next week.

508
01:28:51,146 --> 01:28:56,089
We have had an extremely successful CCSR so far.

509
01:28:56,149 --> 01:28:58,791
We have over 60 kids in the CCSR club.

510
01:28:59,471 --> 01:29:08,697
And we have done two very successful programs under the direction of Melanie North and Marissa Isbell.

511
01:29:09,369 --> 01:29:15,655
And the first one is that they raised over $300 in October by painting faces for students.

512
01:29:15,675 --> 01:29:20,540
The students loved it, and the monies were sent for breast cancer research.

513
01:29:21,061 --> 01:29:30,931
And the second was we had an extremely successful Thanksgiving food drive, which allowed us to make 36 baskets for families.

514
01:29:31,511 --> 01:29:45,237
that the baskets are a huge laundry basket filled with everything you might have imagined, plus money, a gift card for a turkey, and all the fixings, and the paper plates, and all the goods.

515
01:29:45,438 --> 01:29:49,560
And we had so many that we were able to reach out to the McGlynn Middle School.

516
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:53,922
We supported students and families from the Andrews Middle School.

517
01:29:54,362 --> 01:29:57,603
We sent some to the senior center and also to the

518
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:02,854
Community Frigerator, is that what it's called?

519
01:30:03,094 --> 01:30:04,396
The Community Frigerator?

520
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:10,102
So that was a very successful day, very active day at the school.

521
01:30:11,084 --> 01:30:15,930
So student life, that was the next thing that I was asked to kind of take a peek at.

522
01:30:16,430 --> 01:30:17,752
Can you switch the slide for me?

523
01:30:18,382 --> 01:30:26,692
So we had our first spirit week in October, which started with pajama day I have to say that was my favorite day of the year to wear pajamas to work.

524
01:30:27,553 --> 01:30:34,402
And then I dressed up with the kids and I was weird Barbie which I had never even known about until that particular day.

525
01:30:36,907 --> 01:30:39,268
Oh, no, no, no, no, we don't share those.

526
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:47,013
So we and then we had a day where the students dress like the teachers and the teachers dress like the students.

527
01:30:47,073 --> 01:30:49,014
That was quite entertaining.

528
01:30:49,534 --> 01:30:55,317
And then showing your Mustang pride and showing your favorite team support.

529
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:58,759
And what we did was we asked the teachers to take points.

530
01:30:59,406 --> 01:31:02,187
and Tally, the most school spirit team.

531
01:31:02,327 --> 01:31:03,988
And that was our 6B team.

532
01:31:04,048 --> 01:31:07,209
So the day before Thanksgiving, you can see a picture of them.

533
01:31:07,249 --> 01:31:12,051
We went down to the cafeteria and the PTO helped me purchase some pizza for those kids.

534
01:31:12,511 --> 01:31:17,133
And they had a nice pizza lunch before they headed off for the Thanksgiving recess.

535
01:31:18,074 --> 01:31:22,795
We have a pretty active and successful National Junior Honor Society.

536
01:31:23,356 --> 01:31:28,978
Our students at the start of the year had to write their own speech, get up in front of their peers,

537
01:31:29,531 --> 01:31:42,560
present their speeches and be elected to office for the NGHS, which I think is pretty difficult to do as a middle school student and was super proud of them.

538
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:46,423
We do have three field trips already planned.

539
01:31:46,503 --> 01:31:54,469
So next, on December 20th, the sixth grade is going to see the Lightning Thief at the Stonem Theater.

540
01:31:55,416 --> 01:32:00,260
In the spring, the 7th grade is going to see a Wrinkle in Time at the Wheelock Theater.

541
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:07,425
And in the 8th grade, we'll go to Canobie Lake and have a little bit of fun before they head off to the high school.

542
01:32:08,366 --> 01:32:16,352
We also had a 6th grade dance in October where all the students wore neon and there were neon bracelets and it was extremely successful.

543
01:32:16,952 --> 01:32:20,075
This Friday night, Principal Tucci and I

544
01:32:21,431 --> 01:32:23,973
Miss Lally and Miss Bruno will be at the McGlynn again.

545
01:32:23,993 --> 01:32:27,456
We're going to have an eighth grade dance called Winter Wonderland.

546
01:32:28,017 --> 01:32:31,319
And then in March, we're going to have the seventh grade dance.

547
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:36,264
And we haven't thought about a theme yet, but I'm sure the PTO will come up with something wonderful.

548
01:32:37,465 --> 01:32:42,689
So a couple of other things that we'll be doing in the upcoming weeks is during our wind block.

549
01:32:43,169 --> 01:32:49,695
We have been fortunate that the Massachusetts Partnership for Youth

550
01:32:50,347 --> 01:32:58,812
is going to be able to present us two different opportunities for students to have some educational time.

551
01:32:59,072 --> 01:33:03,975
One is the January, the seventh grade will have a presentation on vaping.

552
01:33:04,435 --> 01:33:12,740
And one is in February, the eighth grade will have an opportunity for kind of the dangers of social media.

553
01:33:13,020 --> 01:33:17,423
And unfortunately, something that they have to be aware of is sexting.

554
01:33:17,543 --> 01:33:18,924
So we're going to talk about that

555
01:33:19,622 --> 01:33:22,344
and the dangers that can come from that.

556
01:33:22,504 --> 01:33:32,470
And then we also have had the opportunity to do start with hello and say something, which are both programs through the Sandy Hook Foundation.

557
01:33:32,930 --> 01:33:36,492
We did the I Decide survey and we had some staff train this year.

558
01:33:36,532 --> 01:33:42,175
So we're looking at how we can implement if we have any students that need support through substance abuse.

559
01:33:42,335 --> 01:33:46,378
And we're doing the SBIRT screening this December 13th.

560
01:33:46,458 --> 01:33:48,299
So that's all coming up pretty quick too.

561
01:33:49,189 --> 01:33:57,393
We had a staff meeting today and it was very nice for me to be able to say at 90 days, where are we going?

562
01:33:57,673 --> 01:34:01,135
How will we, who do we want to be at the Andrews Middle School?

563
01:34:01,195 --> 01:34:08,579
So we did some visioning and brainstorming and decided some of our next steps as a school and how we're gonna approach that together.

564
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:09,760
So that's pretty exciting.

565
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:12,321
So thank you for having me.

566
01:34:12,381 --> 01:34:13,762
Does anyone have any questions?

567
01:34:23,066 --> 01:34:24,627
Thank you, all four of you, for being here.

568
01:34:24,727 --> 01:34:25,388
Happy holidays.

569
01:34:26,249 --> 01:34:27,069
All five of you, sorry.

570
01:34:28,350 --> 01:34:32,274
Next up, we have the NWEA MAP presentation by Ms.

571
01:34:32,294 --> 01:34:43,503
Suzanne Galussi, Assistant Superintendent of Curriculum and Instruction, Mr. Paul DeLeva, Executive Director of Data and Reporting, and Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli, Director of Professional Learning and Assessment.

572
01:34:43,883 --> 01:34:44,584
Welcome, thank you.

573
01:35:02,574 --> 01:35:02,795
Thank you.

574
01:35:02,815 --> 01:35:03,777
I'm just going to wait one minute.

575
01:35:04,959 --> 01:35:06,322
Is it okay if I just wait one minute for.

576
01:35:33,148 --> 01:35:33,848
Okay, good evening.

577
01:35:36,509 --> 01:35:37,010
Thank you.

578
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:43,873
I'm just going to welcome Dr. Bernadette Riccadeli and Paul DeLava.

579
01:35:44,393 --> 01:35:46,334
They're going to do the bulk of the presentation.

580
01:35:47,754 --> 01:35:55,818
We do have, I believe, joining us Faiza Khan, Director of Math, if at the end there are any questions for the Director of Math.

581
01:35:57,323 --> 01:36:00,604
Dr. Nicole Chiesa, Director of Humanities, will be joining us shortly.

582
01:36:01,164 --> 01:36:09,126
And unfortunately, Rocco Sieri, the Director of Science, I believe this is his soccer banquet.

583
01:36:09,406 --> 01:36:13,047
I think he has his banquet this evening for the soccer team.

584
01:36:13,127 --> 01:36:15,287
So he will not be here in attendance.

585
01:36:15,347 --> 01:36:17,188
But we want to thank you very much for your time.

586
01:36:17,868 --> 01:36:21,749
And I'm going to pass this to Bernadette Riccobelli.

587
01:36:34,155 --> 01:36:34,635
Good evening.

588
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:35,736
Good evening, everyone.

589
01:36:36,436 --> 01:36:39,078
So nice to see you, and welcome to the newly elected members.

590
01:36:40,639 --> 01:36:42,740
It's wonderful to have you here with us.

591
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:46,022
So tonight, we're presenting a little differently.

592
01:36:46,122 --> 01:36:57,688
So I am going to be actually controlling the slide projection from here, because if the members had an opportunity to go through the presentation, you're going to see that there are links embedded in, and it takes you to specific data points.

593
01:36:58,048 --> 01:37:02,030
So we're trying something a little bit new with this tonight, at least for me.

594
01:37:03,941 --> 01:37:07,523
So again, Mr. Paul DeLeva is here with me.

595
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:15,166
Several of us worked on analyzing the results of the latest MAP growth testing over the past month.

596
01:37:15,747 --> 01:37:21,909
Originally, we were slated to present to the committee on November 20th, and then that was delayed a little bit.

597
01:37:21,949 --> 01:37:29,493
So we took another look, and another look, and another look, and even as late as Friday, we were making some adjustments.

598
01:37:30,765 --> 01:37:39,108
So in terms of the agenda tonight for us, just a little adjustment here, we are going to be talking about the test itself.

599
01:37:39,188 --> 01:37:51,933
So many of you are aware of what the test entails, the overview, but for those of you that are new and for people watching from home, we're going to provide some information on the test itself and its design.

600
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:53,962
We're going to take a look at some results.

601
01:37:54,363 --> 01:37:58,830
We're going to take a look at the data utilization, because that is what is important.

602
01:37:58,870 --> 01:38:00,652
How do we use the data that is yielded?

603
01:38:01,233 --> 01:38:06,982
And then lastly, there'll be some appendix information with more data that is available to you.

604
01:38:14,594 --> 01:38:16,996
All right, so let's first start with an overview of the test.

605
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:18,177
So what is MAP growth?

606
01:38:18,337 --> 01:38:21,719
So MAP stands for measures of academic progress.

607
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:26,662
And it measures what students know regardless of what grade they're in.

608
01:38:27,683 --> 01:38:33,267
It allows us as administrators and for teachers in the classroom to look at growth over time.

609
01:38:33,287 --> 01:38:34,668
And that is really what's important.

610
01:38:34,688 --> 01:38:35,929
We wanna see what their growth is.

611
01:38:37,072 --> 01:38:43,936
It is computer adaptive, and what that means is that the questions change as the student answers the question.

612
01:38:44,536 --> 01:38:51,040
So if a student answers a question correctly, the next question has a little bit more difficulty.

613
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:57,864
And the opposite is true, if the student answers the question incorrectly, the next one is a little bit easier.

614
01:38:58,324 --> 01:39:02,206
So it's important to note, unlike MCAS, this is adaptive.

615
01:39:03,075 --> 01:39:07,487
So it's not the students in the classroom don't have the same questions.

616
01:39:08,069 --> 01:39:09,870
Right, so that's a really important point.

617
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:18,573
That really differentiates a lot of the other type of summative informative assessments that we use.

618
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:21,994
And then what is a RIT score?

619
01:39:22,054 --> 01:39:23,415
A RIT score is really important.

620
01:39:23,455 --> 01:39:27,296
And in a couple of slides, I'm gonna go over what a norm RIT is.

621
01:39:27,316 --> 01:39:29,917
So a RIT is a standard score.

622
01:39:29,937 --> 01:39:33,898
Okay, it reflects a student's academic knowledge, skills, and abilities.

623
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:35,039
It's stable.

624
01:39:36,993 --> 01:39:39,376
It's like marking height on a growth chart.

625
01:39:39,437 --> 01:39:42,200
That's the typical way that it is described.

626
01:39:43,021 --> 01:39:47,327
And it provides a student's percentile ranking and conditional growth percentile.

627
01:39:47,788 --> 01:39:51,633
And it really can show how much the student has achieved in comparison with their peers.

628
01:39:55,049 --> 01:39:57,890
So this is a very widely used test.

629
01:39:58,330 --> 01:40:03,672
So we're talking about over 16 million students are tested each year.

630
01:40:04,192 --> 01:40:10,154
Over 9,000 school systems use the MAP growth system, nine state systems.

631
01:40:10,314 --> 01:40:11,915
Massachusetts is not one of them.

632
01:40:12,275 --> 01:40:14,556
Massachusetts leaves it up to individual districts.

633
01:40:14,936 --> 01:40:16,517
Medford obviously has opted in.

634
01:40:17,837 --> 01:40:22,039
Over 50,000 schools, and it is also given in 149 countries.

635
01:40:24,252 --> 01:40:27,113
So again, it is pretty broadly used.

636
01:40:31,375 --> 01:40:31,595
Yes.

637
01:40:33,656 --> 01:40:34,216
Member Rousseau?

638
01:40:34,676 --> 01:40:35,617
Yes, thank you.

639
01:40:35,697 --> 01:40:39,878
Is the 14 million students, is that worldwide or within the U.S.?

640
01:40:40,779 --> 01:40:44,640
Those numbers are the 16.2 million students.

641
01:40:44,961 --> 01:40:45,681
That's worldwide.

642
01:40:51,751 --> 01:40:57,055
So we administer the test three times a year, and you can see the different levels, the different subjects.

643
01:40:57,215 --> 01:40:59,817
In general, we're talking about September, January, and May.

644
01:41:01,739 --> 01:41:04,201
You can see the specific dates there.

645
01:41:04,441 --> 01:41:11,046
Obviously, we try to vary it a little bit, but in general, three times a year during those months.

646
01:41:11,947 --> 01:41:20,033
All right, now moving on to the MAP test results, which is, I think, what the committee really wanted to hear tonight, among other things.

647
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:40,434
All right, so before we go into the actual data, it is important because the way that we have presented the data to you, we have measured Medford scores against the RIT or the RUSH 2020 norm scores.

648
01:41:41,254 --> 01:41:47,840
So Medford's district school and rate this ethnicity subgroup data is compared to these 2020,

649
01:41:49,810 --> 01:41:52,354
BAP national norms in this report.

650
01:41:52,374 --> 01:41:52,815
Okay, not 2023, but 2020.

651
01:41:55,585 --> 01:41:59,327
And the reason is because these norms are done every few years.

652
01:41:59,367 --> 01:42:00,828
They're not done every year.

653
01:42:01,529 --> 01:42:08,533
So they conduct norming studies every three to five years to provide the best and most up-to-date information about student achievement and growth.

654
01:42:09,253 --> 01:42:21,380
The 2020 norms describe achievement and growth trends for the US public school student population in language usage, mathematics, reading, and science over the 15, 16, 16, 17, and 17, 18 school years.

655
01:42:24,262 --> 01:42:26,104
All right, so that's just important for you to know.

656
01:42:26,124 --> 01:42:28,265
We're talking about pre-pandemic numbers.

657
01:42:29,046 --> 01:42:44,697
When we look at Medford's numbers compared to the norm, the national norm, we're talking about that 15, 16, 16, 17, 17, 18 data that got compiled into the 2020 norm numbers that came out.

658
01:42:45,138 --> 01:42:47,720
The results are based on K-12 grade level samples.

659
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:51,042
Records are sampled between 3.6 and 5.5 million test scores.

660
01:42:54,241 --> 01:43:03,487
from 500,000 to 700,000 students attending over 24,500 public schools in 5,800 districts and spread across all 50 states.

661
01:43:03,788 --> 01:43:07,450
So these norms are based on public school data, not private school data.

662
01:43:08,231 --> 01:43:22,921
It's rigorous sampling, as we know when we're gonna make projections about data, it is important that the sample be wide, and we can see with the numbers, it is wide, and they try to make it as representative as possible to the public school population.

663
01:43:24,926 --> 01:43:29,352
All right, so looking at some data here, you can see that we have in blue, we have the ELA.

664
01:43:29,412 --> 01:43:29,592
Okay.

665
01:43:34,236 --> 01:43:37,137
You can see in blue, we have the ELA mean RIT data.

666
01:43:37,937 --> 01:43:40,298
We have the national numbers and we have district numbers.

667
01:43:40,818 --> 01:43:44,279
In yellow, we have math and in green, we have science.

668
01:43:45,039 --> 01:43:54,742
So for ELA in grades two, three, four, five, six, seven, and nine, the mean RIT scores in Medford were higher than the national mean RIT score.

669
01:43:56,022 --> 01:44:02,384
In math, you can see the grades one, four, nine, and 10 mean RIT scores were higher than the national mean RIT score.

670
01:44:03,496 --> 01:44:09,239
And in science, we're looking at all grades tested in the district had a mean RIT score higher than the national norm.

671
01:44:13,162 --> 01:44:13,482
Thank you.

672
01:44:13,622 --> 01:44:14,683
I just had a quick question.

673
01:44:14,703 --> 01:44:20,126
So when we're looking at those scores, what's a significant difference?

674
01:44:20,306 --> 01:44:25,529
So we've got, just looking at second grade, we've got 172.35 for the national and we're at 175.8.

675
01:44:25,649 --> 01:44:26,270
Is that significant?

676
01:44:31,007 --> 01:44:32,087
a significant difference?

677
01:44:32,107 --> 01:44:34,928
I found myself wondering that as I was looking through the scores.

678
01:44:35,349 --> 01:44:36,749
I don't really have a good handle on that.

679
01:44:37,489 --> 01:44:41,631
So I'm not sure that I have an answer for you on that.

680
01:44:41,731 --> 01:44:50,054
I think that question has been raised in the past, I think, by Mr. Russo, who I think has in the past asked about statistically significant numbers on MCAS differences.

681
01:44:52,088 --> 01:44:54,849
I can't answer that question.

682
01:44:56,890 --> 01:44:58,771
It's difficult to do the comparison.

683
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:01,553
It's a little bit easier to do comparison with MCAS numbers.

684
01:45:01,913 --> 01:45:08,876
It is a little bit more difficult with MAP, because the only thing we can really compare it to is that 2020 mean RIT score.

685
01:45:12,538 --> 01:45:18,981
So we're not saying here that because we're above in these areas, it's great news.

686
01:45:19,361 --> 01:45:20,921
It's an observation to make.

687
01:45:21,382 --> 01:45:36,888
So again, I will go back to when we look at these map growth scores on the district level, on the school level, on the classroom level, what's really meaningful for us and what we think is really meaningful for students' families is when we look at those individual student reports.

688
01:45:37,708 --> 01:45:41,111
and we can see the growth of an individual student.

689
01:45:41,532 --> 01:45:44,975
We can look at the reports, and Mr. DeLave is going to go over some of the reports.

690
01:45:45,335 --> 01:45:52,982
We can look at a report and see student A is developing in this area, is ready to develop in this area.

691
01:45:53,022 --> 01:45:58,347
So I think the most important results that we get are on a lower level.

692
01:45:59,108 --> 01:46:00,669
I'm not diminishing this.

693
01:46:00,949 --> 01:46:02,271
I wish I had an answer for you.

694
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:10,122
I guess all I can say is in these areas that we've highlighted, we are above the national mean.

695
01:46:13,142 --> 01:46:30,787
So I guess part of what I'm wondering is I know in terms of the ELA scores, we're looking to see, partly we're hoping to see that both with our new reading program, which of course we wouldn't see that influence yet, but with the ECRI that's been in place for a few years now,

696
01:46:31,650 --> 01:46:33,471
How is that impacting our scores?

697
01:46:33,591 --> 01:46:36,392
Are the kids doing better than they were previously?

698
01:46:37,312 --> 01:46:43,314
So how do you make that judgment if you don't know what a significant difference is, I guess is what I'm wondering.

699
01:46:43,514 --> 01:46:44,895
Do we have a way of looking at that?

700
01:46:45,905 --> 01:46:51,408
So I believe it was last spring when we delivered the results, the spring results for MAP.

701
01:46:52,208 --> 01:46:58,611
I believe it was a 70% growth in, it was a grade three, or we did see growth.

702
01:46:58,971 --> 01:47:04,414
So when we do this report later on in the year, I think we're gonna be able to make that connection.

703
01:47:04,874 --> 01:47:13,138
MAP doesn't allow, there's not a lot of flexibility with the analytical tools to make a link between

704
01:47:14,776 --> 01:47:15,917
one year to the next.

705
01:47:16,357 --> 01:47:27,507
But when you're doing it within a year, you have a little bit more that you can play with.

706
01:47:27,827 --> 01:47:31,811
I just want to reiterate one thing that Dr. Riccadeli said beautifully, by the way.

707
01:47:32,591 --> 01:47:41,279
And Mr. DeLaver is going to cover the reports again, but I just think it's very crucial that the importance of MAP

708
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:44,381
data is to inform instruction.

709
01:47:45,142 --> 01:47:55,146
It is very difficult, it's clunky to do this district-wide view because you're not going to really be able to do that dive that maybe you're talking about.

710
01:47:55,186 --> 01:48:07,232
The importance of map data for us as educators, both administrators and teachers, is to have that information to inform instruction, to help

711
01:48:07,691 --> 01:48:11,493
which I don't wanna, Mr. DeLay was gonna talk about how we're using all of this data.

712
01:48:11,953 --> 01:48:37,266
So I don't know if maybe we wanna like, I don't know, maybe press pause and then come back to it because the other pieces with the emergence of the early literacy screening tools, we've also brought in DIBLS, which as I informed the community and parents, K and one are using that explicitly for early literacy.

713
01:48:38,153 --> 01:48:38,593
screening.

714
01:48:38,773 --> 01:48:47,135
And we're not starting MAP until grade two, which is more appropriate when we're really looking at how they're applying those skills and when the comprehension comes in.

715
01:48:47,575 --> 01:48:58,357
So I know we may not have answered your question wholly, but maybe if we could like keep going and then we can get to the nitty gritty.

716
01:48:58,977 --> 01:49:02,737
Thank you.

717
01:49:02,837 --> 01:49:05,318
Mayor, can I just ask one more question?

718
01:49:05,338 --> 01:49:05,418
Yes.

719
01:49:08,297 --> 01:49:17,443
I thought the value of math was that you could connect performance year to year, and now you're saying that's not true.

720
01:49:19,865 --> 01:49:20,325
Which is it?

721
01:49:21,086 --> 01:49:34,214
So you can by student, but so I think, Mr. DeLeva, correct me if I'm wrong, doing it, linking from say spring of 2023 to fall of 2023 on a large scale basis

722
01:49:38,868 --> 01:49:48,712
Yeah, it's, it's, it's, we were talking, it's like the funnel, so the district's the top of the funnel, and we are going all the way down.

723
01:49:51,833 --> 01:49:54,014
District, school, class.

724
01:49:56,415 --> 01:50:03,097
And I think the hard part is, you know, just getting to know this a little bit better.

725
01:50:11,192 --> 01:50:15,037
On a district level, I think the next slide is kind of

726
01:50:59,025 --> 01:51:02,687
Yeah, and I think the reason I'm asking, let me just like tell you why I'm asking.

727
01:51:03,087 --> 01:51:08,651
If that's true, then why are we crushing students and teachers under three iterations of this in a school year?

728
01:51:09,195 --> 01:51:12,281
The last of which comes like hot on the heels of MCAS.

729
01:51:12,321 --> 01:51:15,728
And then we're saying, well, it's not really like data we can use the next year anyway.

730
01:51:15,768 --> 01:51:16,810
And if that's true, like.

731
01:51:17,904 --> 01:51:23,067
Why are we testing for the sake of testing, I think is what I'm wondering about.

732
01:51:23,187 --> 01:51:29,610
If there's value in that carryover in terms of informing instruction, then I think it makes a lot of sense.

733
01:51:29,650 --> 01:51:34,852
But I feel like I'm sort of hearing either we're not using it that way right now or it's not true.

734
01:51:34,952 --> 01:51:40,335
And I don't know which, but I'm just really trying to understand there's a lot of testing that goes on.

735
01:51:40,415 --> 01:51:44,177
And I know that we can't just say we're not going to do MCAS.

736
01:51:44,237 --> 01:51:44,677
I get it.

737
01:51:45,546 --> 01:51:52,648
it's still, it's a lot, like it's a lot of days of testing and could the kids be actually learning something instead, is my question.

738
01:51:56,669 --> 01:52:00,410
So, trying to see where I want to begin with this.

739
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:10,953
You are correct in, we've been having a lot of these conversations internally as well, because we want to make sure that we have the appropriate data to inform our instruction.

740
01:52:11,614 --> 01:52:12,894
Part of this

741
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:33,183
part of this as we go along with the iteration of it all, there's the reason that I just spoke about why we are no longer using it for reading for K and one, because dibbles is giving us, and some of the other things that we're doing with the QPS and additional screeners, that's giving us the information that we need.

742
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:40,469
So K and not K, but grade one is, is we're using it for math because it's an important data point.

743
01:52:41,109 --> 01:52:43,651
We're also having conversations and, um,

744
01:52:44,181 --> 01:52:52,745
maybe Nicole can speak to it as well, around the validity for 10th grade because of MCAS and how much we are using the data.

745
01:52:52,805 --> 01:53:02,169
So we are having a lot of those internal conversations to make sure that we are using the data appropriately to inform our instruction.

746
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:05,951
I think the piece of it is,

747
01:53:06,892 --> 01:53:21,943
We can, just to go back to the way it's scored, it's all of the norm measures that Dr., and please correct me, that Dr. Riccadeli spoke about, but it also targets the exact time in which the students take it.

748
01:53:22,203 --> 01:53:30,149
So nationally, we're not going to be, our students are gonna be scored against other students that took it within that timeframe.

749
01:53:31,090 --> 01:53:34,933
So sometimes with the way our cohorts go,

750
01:53:36,340 --> 01:53:43,984
there are different blocks of time in which we can use the data based on when the assessments were taken.

751
01:53:44,664 --> 01:53:58,352
And I think the other piece that we're kind of growing with this program and with the data is also we don't want to over test students, but we want valid data that we can use to inform our instruction.

752
01:53:58,772 --> 01:54:02,314
And last year there was a little blip because

753
01:54:03,985 --> 01:54:12,732
Again, this balance of not over-assessing, but some of the EL students did not take, map all three terms.

754
01:54:13,493 --> 01:54:28,825
And so that makes it difficult for us to then use that data and say that the data from last year is going to be exactly accurate when we're looking at the growth of students because it wasn't the same participants in each data set.

755
01:54:29,706 --> 01:54:33,529
This year, we are going to have all students participate,

756
01:54:34,295 --> 01:54:38,836
in that so that we are going to have clear, clean data to be able to use.

757
01:54:38,856 --> 01:54:42,738
Thank you.

758
01:54:46,839 --> 01:54:55,722
So just moving on, so this slide is really a depiction of the, let me just go back, of this.

759
01:54:55,762 --> 01:54:56,882
So we took a look at this data.

760
01:54:57,972 --> 01:55:02,496
This one, this is a depiction really where you can see the red norm line.

761
01:55:03,337 --> 01:55:06,780
And then the same for, I apologize.

762
01:55:09,202 --> 01:55:11,144
This is grade six to 12.

763
01:55:11,184 --> 01:55:15,888
So really it's just a visual depiction of that first chart of data that we looked at.

764
01:55:16,688 --> 01:55:18,150
All right, moving along.

765
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:20,692
So this slide, this is where we,

766
01:55:22,321 --> 01:55:32,430
several of us that got together, we looked at the data, and the full set of data can be found in the appendix at the end of the presentation.

767
01:55:33,471 --> 01:55:40,337
So it yields some descriptive information about the variations in schools, grades, and ethnic groups.

768
01:55:41,138 --> 01:55:47,844
And while there are many, many observations that we can make, what we decided to do here was just to highlight some of the ones that

769
01:55:48,294 --> 01:55:50,635
that we saw that kind of stood out.

770
01:55:51,275 --> 01:56:06,020
So the first bullet here, it says, in science, the mean RIT scores for all elementary schools, so all four elementary schools in grades four, five, seven, eight, nine, and 10 across the district were higher than the national mean RIT score.

771
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:07,381
So again, that is in science.

772
01:56:08,361 --> 01:56:09,702
We're just gonna take a look at that.

773
01:56:09,722 --> 01:56:13,423
All right, so when we look at science,

774
01:56:15,093 --> 01:56:32,003
We can see here that, so in grades three, four, and five, we can see in science at the Brooks Elementary School, the school-rate scores are higher than the national norm.

775
01:56:32,683 --> 01:56:42,109
If we flip over to the McGlynn Elementary, we look at science, we can also see that they are above the national norm.

776
01:56:43,308 --> 01:56:44,629
And I know I'm going quickly here.

777
01:56:44,689 --> 01:56:50,333
I'm going to scroll next to the Missittuck Elementary, looking at that green column, looking at science.

778
01:56:50,734 --> 01:56:55,737
We can see the same, where the school scores are higher than the national norm.

779
01:56:56,398 --> 01:57:04,424
And then lastly, to the Roberts, we see the same thing in the green column, where the school WRIT scores are higher than the national mean.

780
01:57:04,884 --> 01:57:18,236
So again, it's not that we are equating the norm with excellence, it's something that we're taking a look at, and we can obviously see that our schools scored higher than that norm.

781
01:57:20,978 --> 01:57:24,261
Moving on to the second bullet, taking a look at the Brooks data.

782
01:57:24,281 --> 01:57:31,748
At the Brooks Elementary School, the mean RIT scores for ELA, math, and science in all grades were higher than the national mean RIT scores

783
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:34,971
in those same content areas.

784
01:57:35,551 --> 01:57:45,933
So taking a look at that data at the Brooks Elementary School, you can see in the ELA column in blue, the school scores are higher than the national mean.

785
01:57:46,433 --> 01:57:54,815
The math scores identified in yellow are higher than the national mean, and the same for science in the grades that were tested.

786
01:57:56,335 --> 01:58:00,816
So clearly at the Brooks, we're seeing

787
01:58:02,523 --> 01:58:03,964
we're seeing higher than norm scores.

788
01:58:07,747 --> 01:58:20,017
Going down to the third bullet, in grade four across the district, all schools had higher mean RIT scores than the national norm RIT in ELA and science.

789
01:58:20,238 --> 01:58:22,039
Not math, but ELA and science.

790
01:58:22,099 --> 01:58:22,860
Math was close.

791
01:58:23,479 --> 01:58:26,281
I think there was one school that was off.

792
01:58:26,621 --> 01:58:37,049
So if we look at the ELA and science scores at the Brooks, okay, we already kind of took a look at the science, but we can see the ELA scores.

793
01:58:42,814 --> 01:58:52,141
At the McGlynn, we can see the ELA scores, the ELA and the science scores are higher.

794
01:58:54,306 --> 01:58:56,468
At the Missituck Elementary, the same.

795
01:58:56,488 --> 01:59:04,453
And then lastly, at the Roberts Elementary School.

796
01:59:05,173 --> 01:59:05,634
So again.

797
01:59:08,856 --> 01:59:09,656
Okay.

798
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:15,941
Next one.

799
01:59:20,564 --> 01:59:21,004
Other side.

800
01:59:23,413 --> 01:59:34,159
All right, the next bullet, the Asian, Black, White, and Latino subgroups in grade two with the Roberts all had a mean RIT higher than the national mean RIT in ELA.

801
01:59:35,140 --> 01:59:51,990
So with regard to, again, those subgroups, the subgroups that are available in the MAP test, we can see that the means in those different ethnic groups are higher than the national mean in grade two.

802
02:00:04,474 --> 02:00:06,016
We knew you were going to ask that.

803
02:00:13,323 --> 02:00:13,603
Sorry.

804
02:00:16,426 --> 02:00:16,646
Okay.

805
02:00:20,196 --> 02:00:27,340
We're having an issue because what's pulling the student data is the Clever from School Brains is putting it into MAP.

806
02:00:28,261 --> 02:00:38,508
So we were able to get this subgroup data, but I'm trying to figure out why we're not being able to pull the other data because School Brains does identify those factors.

807
02:00:38,768 --> 02:00:42,510
So we haven't been able to grasp at this yet.

808
02:00:42,750 --> 02:00:47,813
And again, I'm sort of jumping ahead in my part of the presentation, but we're also trying to get,

809
02:00:49,960 --> 02:00:50,700
which I think Ms.

810
02:00:50,720 --> 02:00:59,243
Galushi is going to bring up as well, a program that's going to kind of tie everything in together so that we can isolate that quicker.

811
02:00:59,543 --> 02:01:09,006
But the hope is that we can get that when we get to the fall, the winter, the winter time, but we weren't able to pull it from this report.

812
02:01:09,046 --> 02:01:10,687
Otherwise we definitely would have put that in.

813
02:01:14,508 --> 02:01:16,029
I, whatever the committee wants.

814
02:01:19,430 --> 02:01:19,550
Yeah.

815
02:01:23,186 --> 02:01:29,388
All right, so we're just moving on the second column on that page.

816
02:01:29,528 --> 02:01:37,050
At Medford High School, the school mean RIT scores were higher than or equal to the national mean RIT in ELA, math, and science.

817
02:01:38,251 --> 02:01:42,052
So if we take a look at the Medford High School data, we can see that.

818
02:01:49,793 --> 02:02:04,823
Moving on, at Medford High School, and that includes Medford Vocational Technical High School, the Asian subgroup scored higher than the national norm in ELA, math, and science.

819
02:02:04,843 --> 02:02:11,968
So this is, okay, this is the right slide.

820
02:02:12,248 --> 02:02:16,811
And we also can see that the white subgroup also scored higher.

821
02:02:20,302 --> 02:02:21,123
Thank you.

822
02:02:21,703 --> 02:02:23,624
I've been confused by this slide.

823
02:02:23,684 --> 02:02:25,065
It's come up a couple of times now.

824
02:02:27,246 --> 02:02:30,188
When it says the national, that's the national of all students.

825
02:02:30,688 --> 02:02:38,113
And so I'm just confused why we would compare subgroups to all students, which make that comparison sure.

826
02:02:38,773 --> 02:02:43,536
But I would like to know how our Asian students are doing to the national Asian students.

827
02:02:43,776 --> 02:02:46,118
I mean, because

828
02:02:49,249 --> 02:02:52,952
I guess this is, to me, seems like not terribly important data.

829
02:02:53,432 --> 02:02:58,216
I wanna know how our black students are doing compared to the black students nationally.

830
02:02:59,396 --> 02:03:03,039
Because that's why we even have subgroups.

831
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:07,842
It's not to compare them to the big number for all students.

832
02:03:08,023 --> 02:03:08,423
It's to compare.

833
02:03:08,443 --> 02:03:09,243
Point of information.

834
02:03:12,526 --> 02:03:16,569
Point of information, Member McLaughlin, or I would question that.

835
02:03:22,281 --> 02:03:36,511
that it's important to compare subgroup to subgroup, but it is also very important to compare subgroup to national or international, so that you're getting it across sector of data.

836
02:03:36,811 --> 02:03:37,151
Thank you.

837
02:03:37,191 --> 02:03:38,672
I didn't say that it wasn't important.

838
02:03:38,732 --> 02:03:40,874
I said it was not the only important thing.

839
02:03:40,894 --> 02:03:42,235
That's correct.

840
02:03:43,095 --> 02:03:44,196
So that wasn't a question, though.

841
02:03:44,296 --> 02:03:45,657
Point of information is a question.

842
02:03:46,077 --> 02:03:46,137
OK.

843
02:03:47,738 --> 02:03:57,063
Anyways, so this slide does not give us the information we need, and I'm assuming NWEA map does provide that, or maybe they don't.

844
02:03:57,883 --> 02:04:00,285
So then I'm not sure what the point of this slide is.

845
02:04:00,885 --> 02:04:01,825
We wouldn't put it in.

846
02:04:03,466 --> 02:04:04,547
We were thinking the same thing.

847
02:04:04,707 --> 02:04:11,931
We just couldn't find the numbers on their website or anything to get that.

848
02:04:13,649 --> 02:04:25,292
So I guess I'm confused why they would provide us the ability to see how our subgroups are doing, but then also not provide any information about how subgroups are doing nationally.

849
02:04:25,352 --> 02:04:30,113
That does not seem like a reasonable thing for a product to provide.

850
02:04:30,633 --> 02:04:36,274
They must have those things because they are providing those delineated pieces of information to us.

851
02:04:37,652 --> 02:04:41,173
I mean, we didn't do these calculations, they came from their product.

852
02:04:41,694 --> 02:04:45,655
So they know how these subgroups are doing nationally.

853
02:04:46,015 --> 02:04:59,420
Whether they're willing to share it, maybe they have a reason for not sharing it, but I really feel like somebody needs to figure that out because it's just critical information.

854
02:04:59,940 --> 02:05:02,841
I mean, I feel like if we're not gonna know that at all,

855
02:05:06,983 --> 02:05:17,647
Anyways, I just think that this slide is definitely missing something and somebody should call them up and ask them what the heck's going on because it's critical.

856
02:05:17,687 --> 02:05:25,610
It is certainly critical to know against the, like these categories right here, by the way, these are Medford's categories.

857
02:05:26,491 --> 02:05:29,772
Where's the Medford ninth grade?

858
02:05:30,072 --> 02:05:35,554
I see national, there should be another column there for district also that covers all students.

859
02:05:38,121 --> 02:05:45,363
It should be on the same slide though.

860
02:05:45,403 --> 02:05:53,066
I mean, these four, Asian, black, white, and Latino are all Medford numbers, right?

861
02:05:54,036 --> 02:05:58,717
because nobody really wants to sit here and just discuss their data nationally.

862
02:05:59,257 --> 02:06:08,560
So all of those things averaged together based on the number of students, et cetera, would provide us with the district number is, which I think was on another slide somewhere.

863
02:06:10,160 --> 02:06:13,781
So slide eight, thank you.

864
02:09:16,971 --> 02:09:32,957
You're gonna hear from Mr. DeLeva in just a couple of minutes, the connection, actually a very real connection between MAP and MCAS that I think has a lot of utility for us, our students and moving forward.

865
02:09:33,598 --> 02:09:40,701
So at this point, I am gonna turn it over to Mr. DeLeva.

866
02:09:41,441 --> 02:09:45,683
Before I get started, I wanted to, this might be the last time I see some members.

867
02:09:48,206 --> 02:09:49,486
congratulations on your service.

868
02:09:49,526 --> 02:09:50,447
Thank you for everything.

869
02:09:50,487 --> 02:09:54,568
And then welcome our new members as well, uh, to the committee as well.

870
02:09:54,848 --> 02:10:05,490
And, um, also want to make sure that I do give credit to Dr. Riccidelli, uh, Rocco Sieri and Faiza Khan, because we've sort of all been, yep.

871
02:10:05,670 --> 02:10:09,331
Sorry, I said Dr. Kia, I didn't say Dr. Kia, I apologize for that.

872
02:10:25,990 --> 02:10:26,610
Is it me?

873
02:10:26,630 --> 02:10:27,391
Do I keep hitting it?

874
02:10:27,411 --> 02:10:28,452
All right.

875
02:10:29,272 --> 02:10:29,592
Thank you.

876
02:10:29,793 --> 02:10:30,393
I appreciate it.

877
02:10:31,434 --> 02:10:32,294
I appreciate the help.

878
02:10:32,374 --> 02:10:32,715
Thank you.

879
02:10:34,176 --> 02:10:35,056
I'm wearing glasses now.

880
02:10:35,116 --> 02:10:37,918
I used to never have to do that.

881
02:10:38,458 --> 02:10:43,282
But to reiterate the point is that I think we use multiple data points.

882
02:10:44,423 --> 02:10:47,646
And map is just one of those data points that we use.

883
02:10:47,666 --> 02:10:48,827
Yes, we use MCAS.

884
02:10:50,048 --> 02:10:51,169
As Ms.

885
02:10:51,189 --> 02:10:53,511
Galluzzi said, we're using dibbles on the upper grade.

886
02:10:53,591 --> 02:11:02,818
So we're trying to get a picture on that data, and we never really before delved as deep as we have before.

887
02:11:03,539 --> 02:11:05,439
And I think we're doing that now.

888
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:20,103
Part of the work that I have been doing, and I'll get into it a little bit more later too, is I've been going and meeting with, it's been great, across the whole district, I've been meeting with teams of teachers and sort of reviewing their map and kind of coming up with plans.

889
02:11:20,703 --> 02:11:28,325
And then we're already excited to go into the winter season and then review that again.

890
02:11:29,125 --> 02:11:35,689
So on a level of instructional data, I think that's the bigger piece here.

891
02:11:37,070 --> 02:11:56,382
I know on the district data, it's kind of so broad, but I think when we funnel it down, it gets to be a little bit more inclusive and identifying things and making groups on students and talking about areas of focus and stuff like that, because MAP does identify that.

892
02:11:57,321 --> 02:12:01,583
So what you have here on this slide here is MAP actually has a predictor.

893
02:12:02,444 --> 02:12:15,870
So it takes the, what I have here is the third grade fall from ELA projection to what we actually scored on MCAS in the spring.

894
02:12:16,530 --> 02:12:20,332
So if you look here, we look for the little trends.

895
02:12:21,193 --> 02:12:25,255
We were hoping that the red means not meeting expectations.

896
02:12:26,674 --> 02:12:31,537
yellow, orange is more partially and green is meeting and blue is exceeding.

897
02:12:32,417 --> 02:12:35,619
And the hope is that that trend is pretty close.

898
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:47,045
Obviously there's a close trend, but we have a greater number of students that we're not meeting in third grade for ELA based on what map had projected.

899
02:12:47,626 --> 02:12:49,587
When we move to the next one, which is math,

900
02:12:51,487 --> 02:13:06,722
a different kind of story where it projected that we would not meet expectations greater in the fall and we actually have less students that actually had done that and we have more students that are exceeding expectations.

901
02:13:07,423 --> 02:13:08,343
for third grade math.

902
02:13:08,404 --> 02:13:13,606
So we've done all the grades, but we've decided to make sure that we did third and eighth.

903
02:13:14,407 --> 02:13:19,389
Uh, 10th grade isn't pulling MCAS, but it is pulling SAT scores.

904
02:13:19,429 --> 02:13:20,830
So we've been using that a little bit.

905
02:13:21,670 --> 02:13:23,851
Can I just ask a quick question?

906
02:13:24,572 --> 02:13:30,655
I'm looking at, um, what is this third grade math, third grade math.

907
02:13:31,455 --> 02:13:34,817
And it looks like the numbers on the left add up to more than a hundred.

908
02:13:36,383 --> 02:13:36,763
Oh, you're right.

909
02:13:36,983 --> 02:13:37,764
It does look like that.

910
02:13:37,784 --> 02:13:41,526
Because I was trying to figure out like it looks similar, but it's.

911
02:13:42,686 --> 02:13:43,267
Yeah, you're right.

912
02:13:43,527 --> 02:13:44,708
Actually, I was looking at the LA.

913
02:13:44,728 --> 02:13:45,808
It looks the same on that too.

914
02:13:46,308 --> 02:13:47,269
Is there a reason for that?

915
02:13:47,509 --> 02:13:50,431
So this is the graph I literally pulled from map.

916
02:13:52,052 --> 02:13:53,612
It came from the map report.

917
02:13:54,753 --> 02:13:55,994
So I'm not quite sure.

918
02:13:57,796 --> 02:13:58,837
What is the story with the numbers?

919
02:13:58,897 --> 02:14:00,617
I'd have to double check.

920
02:14:00,998 --> 02:14:02,558
But right, everything should be equal to 100, right?

921
02:14:02,658 --> 02:14:03,379
It shouldn't be.

922
02:14:03,459 --> 02:14:05,480
Well, yeah, it's just hard to compare.

923
02:14:05,580 --> 02:14:11,383
If this is a predictor, did we meet the prediction, or did we do better or worse than the prediction?

924
02:14:13,404 --> 02:14:17,025
But you're never going to meet the prediction if you're not on the same scale, right?

925
02:14:17,045 --> 02:14:18,206
Because on the right, 41.32.

926
02:14:22,811 --> 02:14:25,752
95, yeah, the one on the right adds up.

927
02:14:25,912 --> 02:14:32,094
So you can't eyeball this and say we were on target or we weren't.

928
02:14:32,214 --> 02:14:37,997
And I can't tell if it's because the left adds up to more than 100 or if we're really on target or not.

929
02:14:39,417 --> 02:14:42,018
So it would be great if you could get an answer to that question.

930
02:14:42,118 --> 02:14:50,261
Yeah, obviously not now, but I'll follow up and re-look at the numbers and see what came up on the predictor slide to see what

931
02:14:51,308 --> 02:14:54,691
what pulled up and hopefully I can get to 100 and figure out what the problem is.

932
02:14:56,793 --> 02:15:09,044
So then moving on as well with the eighth grade spring ELA scores and comparative to the in the fall compared to what we did in the spring.

933
02:15:09,124 --> 02:15:13,488
I mean, I'm looking just at the bars, but again, if the numbers don't add up, but

934
02:15:14,514 --> 02:15:18,817
You know, again, when the number goes higher, you know, I'm looking at the trend on the red.

935
02:15:18,837 --> 02:15:24,722
I mean, we want more students not, you know, we don't want more students not meeting expectations.

936
02:15:24,782 --> 02:15:30,206
We want more on the blue side of exceeding expectations or meeting expectations.

937
02:15:30,926 --> 02:15:39,293
So when I look at that kind of trend, those are the things that I'm trying to talk about when I'm meeting with teachers as well, when they look at it from,

938
02:15:40,071 --> 02:15:42,512
a grade level or a school level or anything like that.

939
02:15:42,552 --> 02:15:45,034
Your presentation is more on a grade level.

940
02:15:46,154 --> 02:15:48,956
But again, we're talking about funneling it down.

941
02:15:49,016 --> 02:15:52,758
So again, when I move to math, same kind of idea.

942
02:15:53,658 --> 02:15:57,940
I want to see greater greens and blues and less partial.

943
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:07,225
But I think across the district, the partial is the bigger number that's there on every slide.

944
02:16:07,245 --> 02:16:09,106
So we want to try to work and make sure we get

945
02:16:09,793 --> 02:16:10,834
those students since the meeting?

946
02:16:11,294 --> 02:16:14,156
Yeah, I think on the eighth grade one, the charts both add up to 100.

947
02:16:14,276 --> 02:16:22,401
So is what this is telling us that MAP predicted we would have better MCAS results than we actually had?

948
02:16:24,262 --> 02:16:25,503
We're looking at the math one?

949
02:16:25,523 --> 02:16:25,923
I'm sorry.

950
02:16:27,123 --> 02:16:28,805
Eighth grade, slide 16.

951
02:16:31,146 --> 02:16:31,906
For ELA, right?

952
02:16:31,926 --> 02:16:32,407
Yeah, ELA.

953
02:16:32,467 --> 02:16:32,787
I'm sorry.

954
02:16:33,527 --> 02:16:35,428
So yeah, so exactly.

955
02:16:35,548 --> 02:16:36,608
That's exactly what it says.

956
02:16:36,988 --> 02:16:45,430
Based on the map scores in the fall, it was saying that this is if they were to take MCAS at this point, this is what they would have received.

957
02:16:45,630 --> 02:16:50,952
But then when you look at the actual MCAS that did happen in the spring, that's what occurred.

958
02:16:50,992 --> 02:16:54,353
So yeah, that's not the story where we're looking for.

959
02:16:54,433 --> 02:16:57,154
We want to try it again, move more greens and blues.

960
02:16:57,634 --> 02:16:58,014
Thank you.

961
02:16:58,254 --> 02:16:58,714
You're welcome.

962
02:16:58,854 --> 02:16:59,134
Thank you.

963
02:17:03,942 --> 02:17:08,403
So when we do data analysis, and again, I want everyone to think of the funnel.

964
02:17:10,483 --> 02:17:16,404
Really, the work that has been done has been working on a classroom level at each school.

965
02:17:17,005 --> 02:17:20,305
So I'll meet with the third grade, for example, at the Mississippi.

966
02:17:25,506 --> 02:17:26,246
I did it this time.

967
02:17:26,566 --> 02:17:27,287
All right, thank you.

968
02:17:27,927 --> 02:17:28,747
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

969
02:17:31,206 --> 02:17:40,611
Like I'll meet with the third grade teachers, I'll meet with the third grade special ed teachers, and we try to drill down things from the reports that I'm going to show you.

970
02:17:40,651 --> 02:17:46,595
So we do a class report, we do some sorting, we then drill down on a student level.

971
02:17:47,835 --> 02:17:56,598
We talk about doing interventions and how we would group students into reteaching or as well as enrichment as well.

972
02:17:56,658 --> 02:17:59,019
So, you know, you have two sides to the coin.

973
02:17:59,039 --> 02:18:12,783
We also want to make sure that our top students are getting what they need, right, with the win, as well as the students that need certain instruction to make sure that they're at the level of everybody else that's there.

974
02:18:12,823 --> 02:18:15,244
So the differentiation that goes on.

975
02:18:16,516 --> 02:18:18,797
And then we use a data protocol.

976
02:18:18,857 --> 02:18:30,223
So there's a data protocol that's in that link that sort of was developed by myself and a couple others so that we're also using time because time is a commodity when we're meeting with the teachers.

977
02:18:32,144 --> 02:18:40,608
And I wanna thank the committee because I don't think if it was the change for the elementary side, they actually have time to meet because they always have that 1.30.

978
02:18:42,782 --> 02:18:49,294
difference and now that they're following the same schedule as everyone else, you know, I can plan on where I'm meeting with everybody.

979
02:18:50,629 --> 02:18:57,473
And kind of we make observations, we make certain inferences, and then we come up with action plans.

980
02:18:57,693 --> 02:19:09,199
So coming around the next time around in the winter, that's where I'm gonna use the data and meet with them again to kind of say, okay, now we have the growth from fall to winter, because we don't have that right now.

981
02:19:09,660 --> 02:19:11,561
We only have the fall at this point in time.

982
02:19:12,141 --> 02:19:15,043
So I want the fall to winter to see where our students are at.

983
02:19:15,956 --> 02:19:16,657
moving forward.

984
02:19:17,378 --> 02:19:23,086
And again, we do that comparison of MCAS as well so that they can look at it.

985
02:19:23,146 --> 02:19:27,553
They actually have a separate sheet that was created by myself over the summer.

986
02:19:28,334 --> 02:19:31,859
So they've been kind of comparing points on their own when they're working with their students.

987
02:19:33,277 --> 02:19:39,199
So if you look at this potential, everything's redacted and it's just a general report.

988
02:19:39,880 --> 02:19:44,181
But this is the first report that the teachers go into because they go right into their classrooms.

989
02:19:45,002 --> 02:19:54,385
And again, I made the colors very similar to the other reports where greens and blues, we're doing good, yellows and reds, we really need to drill down and see.

990
02:19:55,125 --> 02:19:56,146
We tend to sort that.

991
02:19:57,267 --> 02:20:04,931
And we try to look at what the needs are of every student, meaning the blues and the greens as well as the reds and the yellows.

992
02:20:06,712 --> 02:20:16,477
So when I move into the next one, a little delay there, and I didn't touch any button.

993
02:20:19,087 --> 02:20:24,331
The quadrant chart obviously is what we're always looking for, which is growth and achievement.

994
02:20:25,012 --> 02:20:33,839
Now what this is doing is it is, this chart is taking previous student scores and making a growth chart from that.

995
02:20:34,680 --> 02:20:43,367
So you have students that are in the upper quadrant there, that's their achieving and growing, and you have students in the yellow down below that are showing high achievement.

996
02:20:44,027 --> 02:20:47,650
And a reminder that with that, it's possible that students

997
02:20:51,250 --> 02:20:53,792
are achieving, but they're already achieving at a high level, right?

998
02:20:53,892 --> 02:20:59,255
So that they're going to end up staying stagnant, right, at a level.

999
02:20:59,395 --> 02:21:05,258
And even though we want everyone in the green, some people are already high scored, and that's why they're down in that ever.

1000
02:21:05,818 --> 02:21:11,782
But again, each one of these dots, you can unclick and identify student's name.

1001
02:21:12,486 --> 02:21:25,572
So that's what the teachers do when they look to see where are our achievers using the MCAS data that I've given them already and this data to see what they can do to group students because they do have a period within the day called their wind blocks.

1002
02:21:27,192 --> 02:21:39,158
Elementary uses them on a literacy basis, but the middle schools have them and even the tier two intervention that we can do at the high school of identifying students that could use it, you know,

1003
02:21:40,162 --> 02:21:41,223
You have to pick and choose.

1004
02:21:41,463 --> 02:21:45,268
Unfortunately, you lose an exploratory to get that.

1005
02:21:45,348 --> 02:21:50,794
But at the same time, if you're looking at your predictor, it might warrant that you need to do it.

1006
02:21:50,914 --> 02:22:00,965
And as we talked at the MCAS meeting, and I'm looking at, remember, so we don't want to have a you're not graduating scenario.

1007
02:22:02,168 --> 02:22:11,674
So again, using not just because you didn't do well on MCAS, but using this data as well as where they're at is a way for us to do some rescheduling.

1008
02:22:14,296 --> 02:22:16,157
This is another way that they regroup as well.

1009
02:22:17,178 --> 02:22:21,701
So map goes by areas of instruction.

1010
02:22:22,842 --> 02:22:27,105
And so if you look at it, and it's a little fuzzy, I know, but it's,

1011
02:22:28,188 --> 02:22:32,071
For algebra, right, algebraic thinking and numbering operations.

1012
02:22:32,791 --> 02:22:36,434
So these students are put into groups by their RIT scores.

1013
02:22:36,994 --> 02:22:50,204
So again, now a teacher already sees, okay, these students are here, I need to work with these students here, and figure out what I need to do in order to get them to move over in their instructional area.

1014
02:22:50,684 --> 02:22:57,829
So when I look at this report with them, our goal is to see everyone start to move more to the right from there.

1015
02:22:59,209 --> 02:23:03,832
This is probably my favorite report that I go with the teachers because this is the individual student report.

1016
02:23:04,572 --> 02:23:11,296
So from that class report, what you're able to do is really drill down on a student individually.

1017
02:23:12,296 --> 02:23:25,624
And if you look a little bit in the middle there, you can see what this particular student, they have identified suggested area of focus and they identify a student's strength.

1018
02:23:26,590 --> 02:23:40,842
So here in math, this particular student really has some number in operations and I've shown teachers, if you click that, it gives the skill where the student is at and what they need to develop to improve that area of focus.

1019
02:23:42,444 --> 02:23:52,432
On the other hand, the operations of algebraic thinking, they've met a lot of those criterias because they're above the mean of where they had scored.

1020
02:23:52,532 --> 02:23:54,174
So that's how that gets identified.

1021
02:23:55,094 --> 02:24:15,028
But again, when we're talking about when and regrouping, teachers are now looking at these charts, and they're also grouping their students because they want to do more of number and operations with certain students while, for example, with this student, if they were to go to more of an enrichment piece on operations and algebraic thinking.

1022
02:24:15,648 --> 02:24:16,369
Can I just add something?

1023
02:24:16,389 --> 02:24:16,769
Yeah, absolutely.

1024
02:24:16,809 --> 02:24:19,451
So this is a report that some parents do request.

1025
02:24:25,293 --> 02:24:27,875
I'm not going to touch it.

1026
02:24:28,035 --> 02:24:34,879
And I think it's, I mean, what it looks, it looks like one page here, but it prints out to 32 pages and it talks with the development in each one of these areas.

1027
02:24:34,899 --> 02:24:37,960
So there's a lot of information that is yielded.

1028
02:24:38,381 --> 02:24:45,485
So again, I will go back to on the individual student level, there's a lot that is yielded with the map information.

1029
02:24:46,005 --> 02:24:52,889
I think, you know, on the district level, you know, I'm, I'm in, I'm sensing some frustration and you're not alone.

1030
02:24:53,430 --> 02:25:00,497
because it's just not as advanced as it is on the individual student and classroom level.

1031
02:25:03,219 --> 02:25:16,532
Yeah, and even if you look at this report as well, you have your, so that quadrant chart, like this student would be placed in the quadrant chart that's listed, but also tells us that this individual student

1032
02:25:17,388 --> 02:25:23,733
would be partially meeting expectations based on their RIT score on the fall right now.

1033
02:25:24,233 --> 02:25:30,017
But the hope is when you take the winter that we see an improvement on that moving forward.

1034
02:25:30,678 --> 02:25:40,525
So these student reports are really the crux of what we're doing with teachers to kind of see where we're at and we're doing

1035
02:25:41,018 --> 02:25:44,840
the data protocol to see like, okay, let's make an inference.

1036
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:46,161
Let's see, what can we do?

1037
02:25:46,241 --> 02:25:47,461
What can we do with instruction?

1038
02:25:48,001 --> 02:25:49,402
How can we readjust some time?

1039
02:25:49,422 --> 02:25:53,144
Because again, time seems to be the biggest factor in a lot of things.

1040
02:26:01,868 --> 02:26:02,488
Member Russo.

1041
02:26:02,709 --> 02:26:03,109
Thank you.

1042
02:26:04,529 --> 02:26:08,671
Thinking about that quadrant chart, are teachers looking at that?

1043
02:26:09,532 --> 02:26:09,672
Yeah.

1044
02:26:10,225 --> 02:26:20,807
So a student that might have a whole pile of relative strengths and a major weakness could show up in that top right quadrant.

1045
02:26:21,607 --> 02:26:30,689
And if I'm a teacher and I've got a bunch of students that I've got to focus on, I'm not clicking on that student because I have only so many hours in a day.

1046
02:26:31,129 --> 02:26:36,330
How do we make sure that because this one data point is a student,

1047
02:26:37,332 --> 02:26:55,039
How do we make sure that we don't have, I'm sure when teachers are receiving students into the middle school, into an algebra class or something, and then they find out that, why does little Johnny not know how to do this very basic thing, even though he got great grades and knew all these other concepts?

1048
02:26:56,759 --> 02:27:03,042
It feels like that's a story we hear about when kids go off to college and they can't do some, frankly, basic things.

1049
02:27:03,922 --> 02:27:06,123
And I just feel like this,

1050
02:27:06,704 --> 02:27:21,448
average as a single data point for a student can seriously hide major deficiencies, or is that average not really an average, but it's some kind of other NWEA map calculation that prevents that?

1051
02:27:21,468 --> 02:27:34,051
I mean, I can let you answer it, but I mean, so it's kind of what I said initially, that I think there are multiple data points that we use.

1052
02:27:34,875 --> 02:27:37,996
Like, this is what I want more throughout the district.

1053
02:27:38,497 --> 02:27:40,858
This is not the only driving force.

1054
02:27:41,498 --> 02:27:45,720
There are other data points that we would use to identify that stuff.

1055
02:27:46,720 --> 02:28:02,848
At the middle school level, for example, there is a block that's given on a Wednesday, I remember it, because AJ would know, that we would utilize this time to identify students that are getting their enrichment and getting

1056
02:28:03,601 --> 02:28:05,182
what they need at that point in time.

1057
02:28:05,702 --> 02:28:11,384
Called it RTI, now it changed all the way to WIN, which makes more sense, which is what I need.

1058
02:28:12,104 --> 02:28:22,209
So the hope is that if we continue across doing these practices, that that person doesn't get missed from there.

1059
02:28:22,989 --> 02:28:24,449
But like I said, multiple data points.

1060
02:28:24,790 --> 02:28:26,090
You just mentioned student grades.

1061
02:28:26,930 --> 02:28:32,693
Well, student grades also have to match out what a student actually understands and can produce.

1062
02:28:33,584 --> 02:28:39,449
So therefore, I think that using those kinds of points kind of do it.

1063
02:28:39,529 --> 02:28:41,671
My hope is that we don't miss that student.

1064
02:28:42,892 --> 02:28:45,454
But I mean, sure.

1065
02:28:47,476 --> 02:28:52,280
If you look, I also just because your question I think was specifically to the map data.

1066
02:28:53,781 --> 02:28:57,405
And this is my favorite report as well, because it's also interactive.

1067
02:28:57,505 --> 02:29:00,027
So you can see that the way they've categorized math

1068
02:29:00,738 --> 02:29:02,159
The student is scoring in the yellow.

1069
02:29:02,279 --> 02:29:04,681
You can see that reading is a strength and science is a strength.

1070
02:29:05,061 --> 02:29:08,944
But because the yellow was highlighted, there are a couple pieces here.

1071
02:29:09,025 --> 02:29:17,611
So if you look at the top on the yellow, it's going to give the teachers the possible writ span of where this student should land.

1072
02:29:18,192 --> 02:29:22,275
So I know it's super small print, I'm sorry, but it says between 184 and 190.

1073
02:29:24,454 --> 02:29:30,317
So you're right, that average score, RIT score for this student is 187.

1074
02:29:30,878 --> 02:29:48,167
But if you then look in the middle column, as Mr. DeLava was talking about, but these instructional areas, those are the ones that also give the specifics to, so like 175 for number and operations, that's lower than the RIT should be, right?

1075
02:29:48,227 --> 02:29:50,829
So this student is fine

1076
02:29:51,994 --> 02:29:53,335
Measurement and data is a strength.

1077
02:29:53,355 --> 02:29:56,596
Well, operations and algebraic thinking is a strength.

1078
02:29:56,736 --> 02:30:02,799
Measurement and data and geometry, the student is where they need to be because they're within the, or really close to the RIT score.

1079
02:30:03,459 --> 02:30:13,704
But because number and operations is a suggested area of focus, as Mr. DeLava said, if teachers click on this, it does bring up all the standards, all the strands.

1080
02:30:14,184 --> 02:30:19,366
It will give teachers where to start in terms of an instructional area of focus.

1081
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:31,986
There's a lot on teachers, like teachers are rock stars, because what they have to do is meet their students' needs, and this is where the tier two piece comes in.

1082
02:30:32,386 --> 02:30:45,275
So Mr. DeLava spoke about the wind block at the middle school level and at the elementary level, but if we're looking at math, a lot of that tier two time, there are multiple ways that the tier two time comes in.

1083
02:30:45,335 --> 02:30:47,977
You heard Principal Kaye talk about ST Math.

1084
02:30:48,581 --> 02:30:51,882
and we're trying to encourage that that is done for 10 minutes a day.

1085
02:30:52,202 --> 02:30:53,482
That's an additional piece.

1086
02:30:53,943 --> 02:30:59,964
It's normed the way Lexia Core 5 is, and it's all, it's language-free.

1087
02:31:00,265 --> 02:31:03,526
So it's all conceptual mathematical problems.

1088
02:31:03,926 --> 02:31:15,929
So it's going to meet the students where they are, and it's gonna push them where they need to be, or kind of adapt to where their areas of strength and challenge need to be.

1089
02:31:16,569 --> 02:31:17,790
In addition to that,

1090
02:31:18,962 --> 02:31:41,236
most math blocks are structured in a way at the elementary level so that the lesson is given and then there's a small group time component, which some may refer to as centers, some may refer to it as small group instruction, but the students, you know, if we look at even the scores or whatever, the students that are in that blue and in that green

1091
02:31:41,974 --> 02:31:54,660
They can be more independent during that time, but the teacher may have a small group of students that are gonna need that, like, sheltered scaffold to be able to work on their areas of focus.

1092
02:31:54,680 --> 02:31:57,362
Does that help?

1093
02:31:57,442 --> 02:32:01,544
It helps, but you said something just now that was sort of partially my point.

1094
02:32:01,864 --> 02:32:04,906
Teachers are, there's only so many hours in a day for teachers.

1095
02:32:05,586 --> 02:32:09,948
We just heard that at the Andrews, 2 3rds or 70% of kids made the honor roll.

1096
02:32:12,401 --> 02:32:21,146
I'll go on a limb and bet that means a lot of kids, when we looked at this quadrant chart, were in that big green section for, let's pick math.

1097
02:32:24,688 --> 02:32:32,252
And what I'm worried about is it's quite reasonable for teachers to be focusing on students in these other quadrants more.

1098
02:32:33,786 --> 02:32:35,247
These are the students that are performing.

1099
02:32:35,367 --> 02:32:36,748
These are the students that are growing.

1100
02:32:37,128 --> 02:32:39,250
You've got so many hours or time in your class.

1101
02:32:39,590 --> 02:32:41,331
Who are you going to put more attention on?

1102
02:32:41,371 --> 02:32:46,814
You're going to put it on the students who need more help, which is rational and reasonable.

1103
02:32:47,415 --> 02:32:51,497
But these are one dot representing the students.

1104
02:32:51,658 --> 02:33:00,643
You could be a rock star with these huge scores in some areas of math and then have some major deficits that are just not relevant to what's going on.

1105
02:33:02,418 --> 02:33:05,461
You can just skate through with your A and sitting in the green.

1106
02:33:05,861 --> 02:33:12,947
And then when you go up to the next grade, this happened to one of my children who went into an honors math class.

1107
02:33:13,467 --> 02:33:15,589
And it was because of the pandemic.

1108
02:33:15,649 --> 02:33:17,471
It wasn't for any other reason.

1109
02:33:17,551 --> 02:33:23,836
But there were whole sections of math for which the student couldn't perform, none of them, frankly.

1110
02:33:25,532 --> 02:33:45,655
And while that's a different kind of situation because it was most of the students, I'm just worried about how if you have only so much time in the day and you're looking at this quadrant chart as your starting point for where to focus, you're not clicking on your students that are high performing, high growth already.

1111
02:33:46,636 --> 02:33:54,017
And this is an average that will mean that you have, we put a billionaire in this room, average all of our incomes.

1112
02:33:54,448 --> 02:33:55,168
Things look great.

1113
02:33:56,209 --> 02:33:59,670
Those are not, we're not all making $100 million a year.

1114
02:34:00,331 --> 02:34:09,375
So I just worry about the work that averages can really cause skewing within the individual student as well.

1115
02:34:11,876 --> 02:34:20,280
And maybe there's somebody that makes sure that every single one of these students was inspected at some regularity from this chart.

1116
02:34:21,730 --> 02:34:35,597
I don't know if that's your team or the principals, or does this pop out a report that says, hey, this teacher in math, there was never once did anybody inspect this report for this student this year.

1117
02:34:37,839 --> 02:34:38,959
I don't know.

1118
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:42,361
That's after you've clicked the student, though.

1119
02:34:42,381 --> 02:34:46,143
No, no, but they have, yeah.

1120
02:34:49,004 --> 02:34:49,585
So, yes.

1121
02:35:14,492 --> 02:35:15,432
I doubt that.

1122
02:35:15,772 --> 02:35:16,072
Thank you.

1123
02:35:20,693 --> 02:35:21,593
All right.

1124
02:35:22,173 --> 02:35:28,795
To your point, Mr. Member, so if we look at English for a minute, we look at literary text versus informational.

1125
02:35:28,815 --> 02:35:30,215
Those are two of the categories.

1126
02:35:30,355 --> 02:35:43,157
I know we have math on this slide right now, but what we've done in our department at the secondary level and will do at the elementary level and have as well is let's say we have a student that's very strong in literacy.

1127
02:35:43,584 --> 02:35:44,565
Right, literary text.

1128
02:35:45,685 --> 02:35:48,727
Strong and informational, but there's a discrepancy there, right?

1129
02:35:48,747 --> 02:35:54,309
So we're seeing, OK, we need to do more work in informational, even if they're not on the low side.

1130
02:35:54,750 --> 02:36:01,793
We've looked as a department at those discrepancies to say, we need to build more muscle for informational text, for example.

1131
02:36:02,153 --> 02:36:12,439
So it's not so much your low achievement, high achievement, as it is as a group, like as an eighth grade group, let's say, that we see those discrepancies and we're able to kind of target it.

1132
02:36:14,673 --> 02:36:16,854
looking into the depths of the curriculum.

1133
02:36:17,114 --> 02:36:18,514
Does that help at all?

1134
02:36:19,755 --> 02:36:20,735
And that's just one example.

1135
02:36:20,775 --> 02:36:34,540
If I even look at grammar, and I mean to cut you off, but if we look at grammar and where we have some struggles, what can we do to build that strength, whether it's a higher-achieving student on that or struggling?

1136
02:36:35,240 --> 02:36:36,081
That does help.

1137
02:36:36,141 --> 02:36:42,943
I mean, I think that sometimes we've heard tonight that it was the individual student was the strength of a lot of this reporting.

1138
02:36:44,457 --> 02:36:47,779
And now we're kind of back up to the middle of the curriculum.

1139
02:36:48,079 --> 02:36:48,780
Yes.

1140
02:36:49,140 --> 02:36:53,343
And obviously, I think that that makes complete sense what you're describing, and that's great to hear.

1141
02:36:54,523 --> 02:37:04,730
But if all this testing is about the individual student, then I'm interested in knowing that every individual student's report is looked at by every single teacher.

1142
02:37:04,910 --> 02:37:05,090
Yes.

1143
02:37:06,638 --> 02:37:21,623
no matter whether the student is sitting up there in the top corner green and the teacher has 20 other students in the bottom quadrant who need a lot of time and focus, because a kid could not know how to deal with money, for instance.

1144
02:37:21,983 --> 02:37:32,466
One of my children, math was fine, but then when the report came out, turns out they didn't know anything about money, which for those of us that can just, well, that's just percentages.

1145
02:37:36,314 --> 02:37:52,841
I just worry about, and I think the teachers would worry about receiving students with major gaps that are missed because the report is an average for the whole individual student, which is not, you know, it's not how you teach new concepts in math in particular.

1146
02:37:52,861 --> 02:37:55,162
You need those basic concepts, all of them.

1147
02:37:55,222 --> 02:37:57,162
There's no like optional ones.

1148
02:37:58,103 --> 02:38:00,804
And so I'll stop because I've gone on too long, thank you.

1149
02:38:05,220 --> 02:38:06,620
Yes, member Hayes.

1150
02:38:07,161 --> 02:38:14,323
So I'm looking at slide 21 or at least the numbers 21's class breakdown by instructional area.

1151
02:38:14,343 --> 02:38:28,267
I would assume or hope that teachers would be looking at this that really gives you each student by you know it's not going to break it down maybe as far as you were suggesting member Rousseau but it does break it down by the areas.

1152
02:38:30,305 --> 02:38:33,807
And it seems like that gives the teacher some good information about where.

1153
02:38:34,247 --> 02:38:50,275
Now, what I don't understand on this and I wanted to ask was, is there a score that the teachers are looking for as the kind of, we'd like to see most of the kids falling in this score range.

1154
02:38:50,955 --> 02:38:55,637
And so kids who are below that, we wanna look at whether they're struggling.

1155
02:38:56,698 --> 02:38:56,978
You know?

1156
02:39:00,371 --> 02:39:12,377
I think we're trying to get our students home direction.

1157
02:39:13,717 --> 02:39:21,901
Because that is the average, but that is the middle.

1158
02:39:23,182 --> 02:39:25,203
But it varies by class, by class.

1159
02:39:25,503 --> 02:39:29,165
So like the one class,

1160
02:39:32,349 --> 02:39:33,930
well, that's problematic though, isn't it?

1161
02:39:33,970 --> 02:39:36,992
We've got to have some standard that we're trying to get the kids all to.

1162
02:39:37,072 --> 02:39:52,001
And if it's going to vary by class, when I know, so I guess where I'm struggling again is with, I think members so hit this a minute ago, we keep talking about the real value of this is that the individual student level, or maybe even the class level.

1163
02:39:52,281 --> 02:39:54,122
And I think that's wonderful.

1164
02:39:54,142 --> 02:39:58,805
I mean, I remember before I was on school committee, when you were first talking about this assessment,

1165
02:40:00,330 --> 02:40:07,072
I was like, this is great because MCAS is no longer usable in that way and hasn't been for a very long time.

1166
02:40:07,472 --> 02:40:11,894
So it was a real gap in having an assessment that we could use in that way.

1167
02:40:14,214 --> 02:40:15,195
But I'm confused.

1168
02:40:15,235 --> 02:40:29,559
I find myself, I feel like we are kind of toggling back and forth between the top of the funnel and the bottom of the funnel when we start looking at, you know, when we say something like, well, it's going to be different for each class, but we need something.

1169
02:40:30,923 --> 02:40:38,303
And then I guess I'm hoping also to get a better understanding of why why are we even being

1170
02:40:38,936 --> 02:40:42,739
Well, let me rephrase that, that's not a nice way of putting it.

1171
02:40:42,779 --> 02:40:49,925
The highlights were all really about scores at a higher level.

1172
02:40:50,306 --> 02:40:51,487
Do you use those?

1173
02:40:51,707 --> 02:41:00,995
Do you use, when you see that there's a difference between the subgroups, how does MAP help you use that knowledge, or does it?

1174
02:41:01,215 --> 02:41:06,819
And if it doesn't, then, I don't know, is it worth even spending time talking about it?

1175
02:41:07,947 --> 02:41:10,348
something else that helps us then at that level.

1176
02:41:11,088 --> 02:41:22,371
So I guess that was a lot of questions rolled up into one, but I do feel like this conversation, this discussion is kind of going back and forth, you know, between the higher, the top of the funnel and the narrower end of the funnel.

1177
02:41:22,451 --> 02:41:34,834
And it's hard for those of us who aren't using this consistently or, you know, understand it as well as you do to kind of tease out those differences and understand how this test is really being used.

1178
02:41:37,045 --> 02:41:42,708
The only thing I was going to clarify about the reports is that they're all aligned by the skill or the standard.

1179
02:41:43,268 --> 02:41:50,532
So how teachers or what reports teachers are using is going to be based on what they're looking for for their instruction.

1180
02:41:50,992 --> 02:42:02,258
So the student profile report is going to give that individual breakdown so that teachers can see, okay, because math units, math lessons, math modules,

1181
02:42:03,683 --> 02:42:07,046
they're focused on specific skills and standards.

1182
02:42:07,467 --> 02:42:10,009
When those, and a lot of them are cyclical, right?

1183
02:42:10,029 --> 02:42:16,976
So students, sometimes the intent of the lesson is just for exposure, and sometimes it's mastery.

1184
02:42:17,377 --> 02:42:27,747
But having the individual in the student profile sample of where that student's strengths are, the teacher is going to be more informed when that topic comes up.

1185
02:42:28,706 --> 02:42:36,569
to then be able to, when you look at this one, you can do this by the skill, by that target.

1186
02:42:36,970 --> 02:42:44,313
So then when that lesson comes up, teachers can then take that skill and say, where did the students fall within that range?

1187
02:42:44,353 --> 02:42:48,115
Because this is where I am, and this is where I wanna target my instruction.

1188
02:42:48,735 --> 02:42:53,857
So it's just a different, it's different utility for each report.

1189
02:42:55,758 --> 02:42:56,018
May I?

1190
02:42:56,418 --> 02:42:56,538
Okay.

1191
02:42:57,539 --> 02:42:58,199
Member McLaughlin.

1192
02:42:59,691 --> 02:43:00,272
Yeah, thank you.

1193
02:43:00,732 --> 02:43:05,135
So, it sounds to me like that this is a differentiation tool.

1194
02:43:05,615 --> 02:43:06,636
Is that accurate?

1195
02:43:07,196 --> 02:43:07,317
Yes.

1196
02:43:07,377 --> 02:43:08,217
It's a nice way of putting it.

1197
02:43:08,277 --> 02:43:09,058
So, exactly.

1198
02:43:09,078 --> 02:43:09,258
Thank you.

1199
02:43:09,298 --> 02:43:10,499
It's a differentiation tool.

1200
02:43:10,919 --> 02:43:22,267
So, which is great because I couldn't agree more that I think that, you know, the district and most districts need a lot of help with differentiation and personalized learning.

1201
02:43:23,308 --> 02:43:29,112
So, to that end, in addition to the teachers sort of being able and the data being able to tease out,

1202
02:43:29,724 --> 02:43:42,153
the differentiation that's needed, what are we offering around professional development to help support our staff around how to differentiate, which I think is, again, the gist of a lot of what we're hearing in this conversation.

1203
02:43:42,953 --> 02:43:43,294
Huge.

1204
02:43:43,934 --> 02:43:46,936
And I think that's something that's going to be growing.

1205
02:43:47,937 --> 02:43:53,581
Because I think even from where we started with MAP, to where we are now, to where we need to be,

1206
02:43:56,089 --> 02:44:02,452
you know, I'm going to just review in a little bit about the instructional, and I don't know where we are.

1207
02:44:02,532 --> 02:44:03,633
I guess we can skip around.

1208
02:44:06,214 --> 02:44:06,754
Mayor, may I?

1209
02:44:07,654 --> 02:44:09,615
Yeah, Member LaFleur and then Dr. Edward-Vinson.

1210
02:44:09,915 --> 02:44:10,176
Yeah.

1211
02:44:10,236 --> 02:44:17,959
And I guess that in terms of the differentiation tool too, that's why I think it's so critical when we're disaggregating the data that we're seeing the subgroups, right?

1212
02:44:18,039 --> 02:44:23,922
Because the, you know, if you're, we're talking about, you know, MCAS, for example, and we know what our,

1213
02:44:24,881 --> 02:44:29,663
for lack of a better word, because I hate the way that it's phrased, but lowest subgroups, right?

1214
02:44:29,683 --> 02:44:37,426
So if we're not teasing out those subgroups for differentiation, then that's part of the issue, right?

1215
02:44:37,546 --> 02:44:42,768
So we really need to be able to look at that data to be able to disaggregate.

1216
02:44:43,248 --> 02:44:50,491
And I think that's part of what I'm hearing from member Rousseau as well in terms of looking at the individual student, but sort of being able to differentiate.

1217
02:44:50,871 --> 02:44:52,152
So we're not just talking about

1218
02:44:52,830 --> 02:44:57,194
differentiation of curriculum, we're talking about differentiation of data as well.

1219
02:44:57,695 --> 02:45:03,300
And that's really what we need to be able to use to be able to implement the practice of differentiation, right?

1220
02:45:04,001 --> 02:45:04,401
Well said.

1221
02:45:04,461 --> 02:45:04,662
Okay.

1222
02:45:07,776 --> 02:45:09,378
Thank you, Member McLaughlin.

1223
02:45:09,458 --> 02:45:32,637
I just wanted to restate that as I was listening to the conversation that was being had, when I think about the MAP assessment data, it was said earlier at the beginning that this truly is a tool that should be used by the teacher to help inform her instruction

1224
02:45:33,717 --> 02:45:37,279
To member McLaughlin's point how she's going to differentiate with students.

1225
02:45:37,819 --> 02:45:49,103
I received this exact same parent report for my own child who's in elementary school, and when I've had my parent conference meetings.

1226
02:45:49,583 --> 02:46:03,948
where they pull out the, they talk about the quadrants, but they also end up saying, these are the areas where your child has strengths, and these are the areas where you need to continue to monitor and work with your child.

1227
02:46:04,569 --> 02:46:10,371
And so, Alexia, ST Math, those, you know, in my

1228
02:46:11,731 --> 02:46:15,956
where the braid my daughter is currently in everything is online for homework.

1229
02:46:16,436 --> 02:46:30,110
So it's, you know, part of its Lexia part of its math part of its I ready, and they are monitoring the progress, and earlier on, I believe it was Dr Riccadeli talked about.

1230
02:46:31,852 --> 02:46:43,797
how some of these supportive programs like ST Math, they adjust Lexia, they adjust to where the child, if you're doing well on the assessment, then you will continue to do well.

1231
02:46:43,837 --> 02:46:46,578
They make the adjustments on an individualized basis.

1232
02:46:47,198 --> 02:46:59,383
So what is, I almost feel like where we're getting a little caught up is that, yes, a teacher is able to look at that quadrant graph and see where her whole entire class falls,

1233
02:47:00,023 --> 02:47:05,566
but she also was able to drill down and see how each student is performing.

1234
02:47:06,327 --> 02:47:24,117
And before in Medford, we never had a system or an internal assessment system where we could monitor students' progress across the schools and have it be normed data that we were referencing or using that.

1235
02:47:24,737 --> 02:47:48,386
So I do feel like there is a place for NWEA MAP to support instruction and to help teachers be able to say, oh, I am gonna need to spend a little more focused attention or do another mini lesson or a reteach because I had so many students that struggled with the concept or the opposite.

1236
02:47:49,761 --> 02:47:54,522
wow, my students are doing fabulous with operations and algebraic thinking.

1237
02:47:54,882 --> 02:48:00,944
So that's not an area I can share that data with the students, congratulate them, say pat yourselves on the back.

1238
02:48:01,444 --> 02:48:10,727
We need to spend a little bit more time on measurement and data or number and operations and really target it that way.

1239
02:48:11,347 --> 02:48:24,840
So this is just to really share with the committee because initially the committee, you know, did ask for demographic data, EL data, special students with disabilities data.

1240
02:48:25,421 --> 02:48:33,189
So trying to pull as much data as possible to just share on a global level to say this is where the district is.

1241
02:48:33,789 --> 02:48:43,958
but in the opening when the RIT scores were shared to show where is Medford Public Schools in comparison to the nation.

1242
02:48:45,600 --> 02:48:56,270
And for the most part, we're on par, and in some areas we're outperforming the national RIT scores, and in other areas we are not.

1243
02:48:57,250 --> 02:49:10,136
The MCAS data that was shared, where it kind of gives you the predictor of where they think you're going to perform, and then we don't find out until we actually take the MCAS.

1244
02:49:10,876 --> 02:49:17,539
So, I feel even that predictive aspect of the NWEA map is really

1245
02:49:19,793 --> 02:49:33,425
beneficial because yes, they're saying what students are not meeting expectations, what students are exceeding expectations, and then the students that fall in the meeting and partially meeting.

1246
02:49:34,086 --> 02:49:36,508
So it gives you a ballpark.

1247
02:49:36,668 --> 02:49:43,955
It's not set in stone, but at least you do have an idea of the direction that you're moving in for the time being.

1248
02:49:44,475 --> 02:50:01,853
So I just wanted to say that this really is a tool that should be used and is being used at the school level by the teachers and it can be shared with parents during report card conferences, during SST meetings.

1249
02:50:02,833 --> 02:50:13,497
Data might even be taken into some of the IEP meetings or EL meetings, progress report, progress monitoring on English language development.

1250
02:50:13,917 --> 02:50:20,299
But I just wanted to stress that this is a tool to help us better gauge where our students are at.

1251
02:50:21,400 --> 02:50:21,800
Thank you.

1252
02:50:22,280 --> 02:50:23,661
And I think we're gonna be wrapping up.

1253
02:50:23,781 --> 02:50:24,881
So member Graham.

1254
02:50:26,021 --> 02:50:26,442
Thank you.

1255
02:50:27,342 --> 02:50:30,063
I just wanted to offer maybe a suggestion about

1256
02:50:31,018 --> 02:50:37,203
Like I think part of what's happening is there's too much data at the wrong level of detail for this audience.

1257
02:50:37,783 --> 02:50:47,351
And so while I would expect other audiences to sort of need and want various like components of data in here, like it's not actionable for this group.

1258
02:50:47,511 --> 02:50:54,756
So I just wanted to share like a couple of thoughts and maybe like this can help inform the next presentations.

1259
02:50:55,317 --> 02:50:57,378
And it's just my, these are just my opinions, but

1260
02:50:58,769 --> 02:51:04,392
There's several slides about data observations, and they only talk about the good ones.

1261
02:51:04,972 --> 02:51:07,673
They only talk about the places where we're exceeding.

1262
02:51:08,774 --> 02:51:15,878
And as we were sitting here, I went through all of the appendix charts.

1263
02:51:16,998 --> 02:51:26,583
And my observations are that our black and Latino students are below the national average across the board, all schools, all topics.

1264
02:51:27,546 --> 02:51:31,391
Not all places, but lots of places.

1265
02:51:32,632 --> 02:51:42,024
In addition to that, at the McGlynn Elementary School, there's something happening in grade three, ELA math and science, all subgroups are sort of noteworthy.

1266
02:51:44,035 --> 02:51:52,900
At the Missittuck, math and science are noteworthy, and that means beyond our Black and Latino students, as I talked about being a high-level overall norm.

1267
02:51:53,460 --> 02:51:54,761
At the Roberts, it's math.

1268
02:51:56,002 --> 02:51:57,463
At the Andrews, it's science.

1269
02:51:57,783 --> 02:51:59,024
And at the McGlynn, it's science.

1270
02:51:59,929 --> 02:52:02,630
definitely science and ELA.

1271
02:52:03,331 --> 02:52:19,178
And so when I look across that, like what I would like to see in the future is like, I absolutely think we should celebrate where we're successful, but I'd also like to see like, what are the five to 10 things where you all are like, these are the things that we saw and this is what we're doing about them.

1272
02:52:19,658 --> 02:52:24,200
And so, for example, if it's like a particular grade level at a particular school,

1273
02:52:24,758 --> 02:52:26,259
like there's an intervention there.

1274
02:52:26,699 --> 02:52:30,400
And so I think what we wanna know, what I wanna, I'll speak for myself.

1275
02:52:31,241 --> 02:52:40,185
What I wanna know is that you all know what those flash spots are and that you are like working immediately to address them.

1276
02:52:40,405 --> 02:52:49,509
And then in the next presentation, you can come back to us and say, we talked about these flash spots, here's what changed.

1277
02:52:49,929 --> 02:52:51,910
So if it were my presentation,

1278
02:52:52,529 --> 02:52:59,831
I would cut out a lot of the detail that's particularly around the digging into the student dashboards.

1279
02:52:59,931 --> 02:53:01,531
I think that's super cool and interesting.

1280
02:53:01,591 --> 02:53:11,074
But without having access to the tool to be able to do that, I think it suggests more questions than it answers for us, or at least for me.

1281
02:53:11,754 --> 02:53:15,835
What I would rather see is, what are those trends, good and bad?

1282
02:53:16,355 --> 02:53:17,495
What are the interventions?

1283
02:53:17,635 --> 02:53:18,956
And then just the appendices.

1284
02:53:20,174 --> 02:53:22,736
make every single one of these charts a heat map.

1285
02:53:23,197 --> 02:53:34,226
So you can see green, yellow, red, students who are below the national average in which spots, green, who's above, and then who's like right on the line, either like a little bit above, a little bit below.

1286
02:53:34,746 --> 02:53:43,554
And then you can look at it and visually, you know, like there's a lot of green on this chart, or there's a lot of red on this chart, or look at the red, it's all in the same column and across all of these things.

1287
02:53:43,574 --> 02:53:46,096
So we haven't, we haven't done enough to move that.

1288
02:53:46,156 --> 02:53:47,637
Like, I think there's some like,

1289
02:53:48,064 --> 02:54:02,832
Simple visual cues in addition to like putting the district wide number on the on each of the charts, I think that would also be helpful, but I would streamline everything to like highlights problems interventions here's what we're doing here's what's changed and then here's your appendices and.

1290
02:54:04,293 --> 02:54:05,614
We don't have to keep you here at.

1291
02:54:06,338 --> 02:54:26,572
9pm sort of answering questions that I think in fairness, like, there's nothing we can really do with the information you're providing us, except that, like, as we're going through this, and we have questions like the data needs to be cleaned up so that things add to 100, that all of the subgroups are available, like, that would be my focus for this as you go forward.

1292
02:54:26,972 --> 02:54:35,656
And I think even in terms of the district-wide priorities, learning walks, et cetera, et cetera, I think we know all of those things.

1293
02:54:35,676 --> 02:54:37,357
We've heard you talk about them all the time.

1294
02:54:37,437 --> 02:54:40,859
But I looked at it, and I was like, what's going on in middle school science?

1295
02:54:41,119 --> 02:54:42,620
And we have a new curriculum there.

1296
02:54:42,660 --> 02:54:46,602
Do we have a problem, or is something else going on?

1297
02:54:47,302 --> 02:54:52,445
But I think you can be much more targeted if you're talking about here are the top five things that we're working on district-wide.

1298
02:54:52,825 --> 02:54:58,768
at the district level with an assumption, I think, from all of us that, yes, you're meeting with grade level teams.

1299
02:54:58,908 --> 02:55:00,348
Yes, teachers are using this tool.

1300
02:55:00,469 --> 02:55:03,870
Everybody's doing their leveling of work.

1301
02:55:04,430 --> 02:55:09,913
But I think what we want to know about is, in the aggregate, are we providing the right support to classrooms?

1302
02:55:10,313 --> 02:55:11,713
to teachers, to students.

1303
02:55:12,474 --> 02:55:17,755
And I think using some of the aggregated data is actually the way for us to know that.

1304
02:55:18,295 --> 02:55:21,776
But I think we're a little bit all over the detail map tonight.

1305
02:55:21,836 --> 02:55:26,118
And I think that's why everyone's sort of eyes are drooping.

1306
02:55:26,278 --> 02:55:31,079
And I think everyone's sort of feeling frustrated, or at least that's sort of my takeaway.

1307
02:55:31,099 --> 02:55:37,501
But I think those small changes would make a big difference in terms of how we can have a productive conversation about it.

1308
02:55:39,162 --> 02:55:39,442
Thank you.

1309
02:55:41,232 --> 02:55:41,773
Member Hayes.

1310
02:55:42,914 --> 02:55:43,434
I'll be brief.

1311
02:55:44,915 --> 02:55:47,297
I 100% agree with everything Member Graham just said.

1312
02:55:48,078 --> 02:55:51,961
In terms of presentation of data in general, I would say the same thing.

1313
02:55:52,021 --> 02:55:59,968
I would apply everything she said to MCAS presentations, to any, you know, any presentations you do of data.

1314
02:56:00,969 --> 02:56:01,790
We need to hear

1315
02:56:03,578 --> 02:56:12,621
Where things are going well, yes, but we need to hear, as Member Graham said, the areas where things aren't going well and what you're doing about it, because that's where we're gonna make growth.

1316
02:56:14,002 --> 02:56:26,687
1% ahead of the national norm doesn't tell us anything if we don't understand where we're not meeting the norm or where we're not meeting our personal goals and what we're doing to try to get there, because that's where we wanna know what the growth is gonna be.

1317
02:56:27,127 --> 02:56:31,849
I would also like to add that in terms of the piece of how classroom teachers use it,

1318
02:56:33,339 --> 02:56:36,920
I'd like to hear from a classroom teacher or several classroom teachers at different levels.

1319
02:56:37,821 --> 02:56:39,902
I'd like to hear them explain how they use it.

1320
02:56:40,042 --> 02:56:41,242
They're the ones who are using it.

1321
02:56:41,642 --> 02:56:49,805
It would be really helpful to have them walk through, whether they come to a meeting or whether they create videos, however you want to do it.

1322
02:56:49,845 --> 02:56:52,346
I think that would be really helpful for us to understand.

1323
02:56:52,746 --> 02:57:00,869
Since again, that was the initial reason for purchasing this assessment and using it district wide was to give teachers a tool that they could use

1324
02:57:01,877 --> 02:57:03,738
to help in their classroom.

1325
02:57:04,178 --> 02:57:11,581
So as much as it's wonderful to hear all of you try to explain it, I think hearing it from the source, hearing it from the people who are using it would be really helpful.

1326
02:57:13,082 --> 02:57:17,584
If there's no further questions, I don't know if you want to wrap it up.

1327
02:57:18,164 --> 02:57:26,187
I just want to acknowledge, because I think that the input and feedback is not only much appreciated, but we also agree.

1328
02:57:28,223 --> 02:57:50,867
That's so part of the work that Paul's now working on is digging into a lot of this data at a much more deeper level so that he will be able to provide the trends and the pieces that you're talking about to school leaders and to department leaders so that they can then have those conversations with the leaders who are doing

1329
02:57:51,664 --> 02:57:53,465
also the continuous work.

1330
02:57:53,845 --> 02:58:02,908
Paul is meeting with teachers in common planning time and team meetings and staff meetings to go over that, but it's the whole entire district.

1331
02:58:02,968 --> 02:58:09,630
And so the principals and the department directors are doing that work on a consistent basis.

1332
02:58:09,950 --> 02:58:16,492
So making sure that we're providing them that drilled down data is something that's happening right now because we agree.

1333
02:58:17,509 --> 02:58:25,655
And we did see those trends, which is why we've shared those trends, because it is something that is on our radar that we are working towards.

1334
02:58:26,155 --> 02:58:33,060
And part of that work is going to be the cross-reference of students.

1335
02:58:34,121 --> 02:58:43,287
Once we have that drilled down data of the supports that are currently in place, the superintendent mentioned about the SST meetings that have maybe already been happened.

1336
02:58:43,663 --> 02:58:53,148
the support plans that may have already been created or the ones that need to be updated and created to make sure that we are meeting the students' needs.

1337
02:58:53,208 --> 02:58:59,731
But I do appreciate your input and we'll make sure that we include all of that feedback in the next presentation.

1338
02:59:00,531 --> 02:59:00,771
Great.

We do have a number of condolences, unfortunately.

If we all may rise for a moment of silence.
