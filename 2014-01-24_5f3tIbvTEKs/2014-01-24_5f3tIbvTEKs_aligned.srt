1
00:00:00,212 --> 00:00:01,195
Go at the same time.

2
00:00:01,496 --> 00:00:02,479
It's like shoot to the mirror.

3
00:00:02,499 --> 00:00:04,968
Start at like 50 miles an hour across the room.

4
00:00:45,221 --> 00:00:50,384
time will change everything

5
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:24,913
I intended this to happen.

6
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:26,415
It's like a space shuttle.

7
00:03:04,513 --> 00:03:06,834
All right, Chris.

8
00:03:06,874 --> 00:03:07,214
Wow.

9
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:44,036
We're getting so ambitious

10
00:04:04,552 --> 00:04:06,994
I remember at the beginning of the year, you were like, if you get an A, you're out.

11
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:07,835
That was four minutes.

12
00:04:08,795 --> 00:04:09,936
You did that in four minutes.

13
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:10,857
That was two servos, too.

14
00:04:11,297 --> 00:04:12,638
Two servos, four minutes.

15
00:04:12,678 --> 00:04:13,319
Good job.

16
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:19,483
That looks like a win.

17
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:20,624
Double elimination round.

18
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:21,665
Go, go, go.

19
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:22,826
Wow, nice job.

20
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:23,887
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

21
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:32,539
This is a great job.

22
00:04:32,679 --> 00:04:33,079
Nice.

23
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:33,980
Good, good.

24
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:09,474
I don't know.

25
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:21,184
I don't know how high you were about to reach.

26
00:05:30,618 --> 00:05:55,483
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

27
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:16,584
We are doing so much better than last year.

28
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:38,534
100% better than last year.

29
00:06:38,554 --> 00:06:39,354
Yeah, we're doing 132% better.

30
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:39,614
No, 132... more.

31
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:39,914
132... more.

32
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:41,215
Yeah, no, like, we're doing infinity... infinity high.

33
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:41,835
Whatever, we did it!

34
00:06:41,855 --> 00:06:44,476
Next up, outstanding robot synchronization.

35
00:06:44,496 --> 00:06:46,377
So, this team had one very efficient robot.

36
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:20,973
And another one that went up like absolutely everything it possibly could, came back, and then usually, at the last minute, it would drive it into the loading zone, and the other robot would finally wake up and push the transport square on top of all the cool stuff.

37
00:07:21,393 --> 00:07:24,295
Very cool, very patient robot, and well-synchronized.

38
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:26,156
That is Team 547 Medfield.

39
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:51,594
They don't see me come, oh who can blame them?

40
00:07:52,195 --> 00:08:14,651
They never seem to catch my eye, but I never wonder why I won't fall asleep, I won't fall asleep I am, don't let them know we're coming I am, tick tock higher, take some time to
