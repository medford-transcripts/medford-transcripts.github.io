1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,510
[SPEAKER_01]: our students in the Medford Public Schools.

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:04,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to the show, Mare.

3
00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:05,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, thank you for having me, Terry.

4
00:00:05,812 --> 00:00:06,653
[SPEAKER_01]: You are welcome.

5
00:00:07,793 --> 00:00:18,319
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we're seeing so much hostility and pain in the world right now, I'm currently writing from a place of some anxiety and deep reflection.

6
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:25,903
[SPEAKER_01]: So as is my custom in hosting these evenings, I like to share a piece of verse that is hopeful.

7
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:27,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

8
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:29,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's called Maybe.

9
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:35,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if we could all cry together, we could make it all right.

10
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:44,763
[SPEAKER_01]: We could wash each other in familiar tears, bathing away the dirt of a filthy world with something like a warm spring rain.

11
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:55,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if we could all grieve as one over the confusion and mayhem and death of a society gone more than a bit mad, we could get past the anger.

12
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:57,884
[SPEAKER_01]: We could get out the anxiety.

13
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,346
[SPEAKER_01]: We could get around fear.

14
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:01,929
[SPEAKER_01]: We could get to real conversation.

15
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:03,952
[SPEAKER_01]: We could get on with forgiveness.

16
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:09,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if we could put down our weapons, we could recover the peaceful kingdom.

17
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,397
[SPEAKER_01]: We could rekindle lost relationships.

18
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:14,799
[SPEAKER_01]: We could embrace human diversity.

19
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,102
[SPEAKER_01]: We could rediscover beloved community.

20
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:22,768
[SPEAKER_01]: We could be equal sons, daughters, and heirs to a loving and liberating God.

21
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:35,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if we could pick up our crosses and carry them toward the hills of salvation together, we could see each other's footprints in the sand and snow and unpaved byways.

22
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:37,417
[SPEAKER_01]: We would know our neighbors.

23
00:01:37,857 --> 00:01:40,359
[SPEAKER_01]: We would see the road unfold before us.

24
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,020
[SPEAKER_01]: We would feel the same wind in our sails.

25
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,622
[SPEAKER_01]: We would value the journey beyond the destination.

26
00:01:47,703 --> 00:01:50,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if we could prize people over possessions.

27
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:52,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone could have enough to thrive.

28
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:55,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone could flourish, not just survive.

29
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,473
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone could learn to really give.

30
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:01,436
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone could value the life we live.

31
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:04,619
[SPEAKER_01]: No one would ever leave his brother behind.

32
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone could lift as we all try to climb.

33
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:14,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe if we could all laugh together, we could hear the universal sound of joy.

34
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:17,666
[SPEAKER_01]: We could revel in the gurgle of all the babies.

35
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:26,669
[SPEAKER_01]: We could immerse ourselves in the sweetness of each sparkling smile, the heartiness of each chortle, chuckle, guffaw, and belly laugh.

36
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:33,311
[SPEAKER_01]: We would let our frozen guard down and warm to the thawing of a kindred humanity.

37
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:36,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe, just maybe.

38
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:38,897
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

39
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:40,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

41
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,587
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's hopefully a good place to start.

42
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:49,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's really welcome Mayor Brianna and have a friendly chat.

43
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:52,218
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

44
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:52,899
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

45
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:53,540
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,682
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've been kind of busy lately.

47
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,983
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing the business of the city.

48
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:09,410
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing to, as Whitney Gilbert used to say on her show, relax, relate, and release?

49
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:12,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Very busy lately.

50
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:13,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

51
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:29,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we're running the city, the campaign on top of that, and then I have three very, very happy and healthy but busy children, and I kick it over nine traveling sports teams this fall, so.

52
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:36,588
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband and I, it's like we're strangers in the wind, but we make it work and get it together.

53
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:37,808
[SPEAKER_00]: It's keeping us all out of trouble.

54
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:44,753
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, trying to make sure that our city's operating, and then I'm also the chair of the school committee.

55
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:46,474
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's been busy, but good.

56
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:50,597
[SPEAKER_00]: And we only have four days left for the campaign, and hopefully be able to put that behind us.

57
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:53,399
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see every candidate is tired.

58
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,020
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a lot to be able to do the work.

59
00:03:56,902 --> 00:04:07,951
[SPEAKER_00]: be out there, although I always love going to the events and things like that, but adding, you know, the canvassing and the sign holding and filling out surveys and it's just, it's a lot.

60
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:08,852
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been busy.

61
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:10,493
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt about it, no doubt about it.

62
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:11,774
[SPEAKER_01]: But all good, all good.

63
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:12,795
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, all right.

64
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:16,338
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they give you a moment or two to relax from time to time?

65
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:19,026
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I try to get out for a run once a week.

66
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:19,746
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

67
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:25,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to watch maybe one TV show a week just to clear the mind.

68
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:26,472
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

69
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:27,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

70
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:27,913
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

71
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:28,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

72
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:29,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

73
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:35,639
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you meet and eventually marry your husband, David?

74
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:36,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good question.

75
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:43,619
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend, who's still my good friend, she was over for Halloween.

76
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:59,125
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been friends since kindergarten, and she was dating somebody from Long Island to New York, and said, I think my boyfriend's friend, you'd really get along with him.

77
00:04:59,145 --> 00:04:59,926
[SPEAKER_00]: You should come meet him.

78
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:03,287
[SPEAKER_00]: And that happened for about three, four, five, six months.

79
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:05,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, I said, OK, I'll go and meet him.

80
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:12,572
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went up to, at the time they were living in Connecticut, and we hit it off the first night, and we've been together ever since.

81
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,193
[SPEAKER_01]: So she knows you a little bit.

82
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,073
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit.

83
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:20,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Every anniversary for my husband and I, she sends me a, you're welcome, text.

84
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:21,637
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

85
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:24,838
[SPEAKER_00]: Not happy anniversary, but you're welcome.

86
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:27,660
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, thanks for the 20th time.

87
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,461
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many years in are you?

88
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:37,731
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been together 20 plus years and we've been married 15 and a half years.

89
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:38,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Congratulations.

90
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:38,871
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

91
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:39,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.

92
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:40,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good.

93
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:44,553
[SPEAKER_01]: How is your hubby feeling about you running for a third term?

94
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:48,938
[SPEAKER_00]: He's always very supportive.

95
00:05:49,618 --> 00:05:54,862
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell the story that he is a physical therapist, and he's local now.

96
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:57,683
[SPEAKER_00]: He's Medford, Arlington, and Winchester.

97
00:05:57,723 --> 00:06:01,346
[SPEAKER_00]: But before he opened his own practice,

98
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:04,807
[SPEAKER_00]: he was down in the Walpole-Sharon area.

99
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:20,771
[SPEAKER_00]: So from 6 in the morning until 8 at night, 9 at night and then also on Saturdays he was working and I was practicing law, taking care of the babies and that was 10-12 years so finally when we were deciding

100
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:25,816
[SPEAKER_00]: if I should run for mayor, was it the right decision for the family?

101
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:34,427
[SPEAKER_00]: And we decided that, yes, we want to do it because we have kids in the schools and we do want the best for our community.

102
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:37,471
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, it's your turn.

103
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:49,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so he's extremely supportive, you know, he does a lot of the athletics especially on nights that I have meetings And yeah, yeah, I think it's a little overwhelming.

104
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:57,329
[SPEAKER_00]: It's tough for him the social media a part of it and the negativity Yeah gets to him a bit especially just like around now and it really heats up.

105
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:58,530
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been lucky.

106
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,575
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a very good campaign season, you know, I think Councilor Caraviello and I really trying to run a a

107
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:04,956
[SPEAKER_00]: as much as we can.

108
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:16,501
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's going to get tough today, but otherwise it's been a pretty calm, not too much negativity, which is great.

109
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:19,502
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it turns up, yeah, that gets to my husband a bit.

110
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:33,273
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah which which is understandable understandable but you know as you say and to his credit you know Rick is a pretty honorable guy so you know he didn't like to get down in the weeds in the mud that's not really his style

111
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:42,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I think we probably have answered some of this question with what you just said.

112
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:47,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to ask you a little bit about the division of labor in the household.

113
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:51,795
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you said, David is doing his thing right now.

114
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,957
[SPEAKER_01]: He's getting the kids where they need to be.

115
00:07:54,537 --> 00:08:00,686
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I do too, you know, one weekend I'll have a couple, an hour and I'll do the food shopping, the next weekend he'll do it.

116
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:07,497
[SPEAKER_00]: And my kids, we taught them how to turn on and put in soap to the laundry machine, you know, they have to do their own dishes.

117
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:10,060
[SPEAKER_00]: We have chores in the house, so we really try to

118
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:13,804
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all they've known me in politics, whether it was Councilor or mayor.

119
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:19,688
[SPEAKER_00]: So I try to teach them the good of the job and the good that you can do in the community.

120
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:23,832
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they understand it and want to pitch in some.

121
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:25,873
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make it work.

122
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:31,438
[SPEAKER_01]: Has any one of them expressed any kind of an interest in what you do?

123
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:36,716
[SPEAKER_00]: My son is affected by the goods.

124
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:42,401
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we do a community-wide cleanup, he'll clean up an area and then he'll never forget it.

125
00:08:42,461 --> 00:08:44,203
[SPEAKER_00]: And he has to tell me every time.

126
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:47,286
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we put flags on the graves for Memorial Day.

127
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:53,111
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time we drive by Oak Grove, he's like, that's where we go in May, and we put flags on the graves.

128
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:56,274
[SPEAKER_00]: but I think they're all impacted.

129
00:08:56,314 --> 00:09:04,860
[SPEAKER_00]: My other two are older teenage daughters, so they watch the debate and they're learning and understanding.

130
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,842
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they want to talk about politics much?

131
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:20,232
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, but there'll be times that I just make sure I tell them a story about something that I think will affect them in the future, whether that has to do with working hard or holding somebody accountable or recently,

132
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:26,215
[SPEAKER_00]: that we'd got the verdict for the bribery case in Medford.

133
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:36,020
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like you try to explain that to them so they know what integrity is and what that scheme was about and do my best to not not infiltrate them with it.

134
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,202
[SPEAKER_00]: But once in a once in a while, tell them a story that I know will impact them in the future.

135
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:42,263
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, OK.

136
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:44,404
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're two terms in.

137
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:49,467
[SPEAKER_01]: How different has it been in the second term than it was in the first?

138
00:09:52,276 --> 00:09:52,416
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

139
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:54,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Three and three and a half years.

140
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:59,181
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first term we about eight weeks in, we got hit with covid.

141
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:11,431
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of that a lot of the first term was getting through covid, making sure everybody was healthy and safe and then getting the city back up and running while we were doing the planning.

142
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:16,535
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're doing the housing production plan and the climate action and adaptation plan.

143
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:21,177
[SPEAKER_00]: and our comprehensive master plan and our street and sidewalk assessment.

144
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:26,063
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were really people didn't see us out much, but we were in City Hall.

145
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:30,448
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole City Hall was always open unless the governor shut it down.

146
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:35,994
[SPEAKER_00]: We were grinding and doing the work and trying to have the community meetings, even if they were on Zoom.

147
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:37,735
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting that planning done.

148
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:47,364
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's exciting to see more and more projects breaking ground and ribbon cuttings, because that's the work we did the first two years.

149
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:54,711
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the largest park project where just broke ground on, which is Carr Park, and then Gillis is halfway through.

150
00:10:55,451 --> 00:11:03,457
[SPEAKER_00]: because that needed some accessibility improvements, and it's going to be a great park for people of all ages and abilities.

151
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,080
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you see the Great American Bear Hall.

152
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to go visit the site yesterday.

153
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:11,903
[SPEAKER_00]: That's broken ground, and that's going to be done in June.

154
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:15,846
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to have 90 bears on tap and all kinds of food and games.

155
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:22,030
[SPEAKER_00]: That went wild on social media yesterday, so people are seeing all the projects.

156
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,613
[SPEAKER_00]: We're finally able to see the work getting done.

157
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:32,818
[SPEAKER_00]: We did two miles of, I know we have a lot more miles due, but two miles of sidewalk repairs just this year.

158
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:45,387
[SPEAKER_00]: We've removed half of our tree stumps, which was just, it took two years to, we've been removing them every year, but we finally got to a point where we found the funding, we're applying for grants, we're receiving the grants,

159
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:58,536
[SPEAKER_00]: moving forward on a municipal vulnerability preparedness work through our liaisons and connectors, and you're seeing the different events pop up that, you know, it takes time to plan.

160
00:11:58,556 --> 00:11:59,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Understood.

161
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:01,999
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot going on, which is just the positive.

162
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,401
[SPEAKER_00]: The positive is so positive, and that's why I love the job.

163
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:06,042
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it outweighs the negatives.

164
00:12:06,322 --> 00:12:07,043
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, OK.

165
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:11,351
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to me a little bit about your current team.

166
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:14,196
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always a lot of change taking place at City Hall.

167
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:17,222
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you have for players right now?

168
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:29,071
[SPEAKER_00]: We have I merged early on in the term, merged the Office of Community Development with Energy and Environment.

169
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:35,115
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have our Planning, Development and Sustainability Department, which is run by Director Hunt.

170
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:38,718
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion

171
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:44,242
[SPEAKER_00]: director who's been at it for quite some time now with us, Francis Wojtyla.

172
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:55,051
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a good strong Department of Public Works and engineering team with Director Blake, Director Wartell and McGivern.

173
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:59,695
[SPEAKER_00]: We finally had a place with our parking department with Faye Morrison where

174
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:05,759
[SPEAKER_00]: And our special projects manager, Jim Silva, that's helping with any parking issues we see that pop up.

175
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:13,024
[SPEAKER_00]: And people finally are getting, follow the rules of the road, and we're making progress there.

176
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:14,525
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the list goes on.

177
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,526
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a really strong finance team.

178
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:29,074
[SPEAKER_00]: We have procurement, treasure collector, CFO, budget director, that are all, we had a budget, we won a budget award two years ago, applied again.

179
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:37,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I feel like we have a strong team, good chiefs in place, and yeah.

180
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:39,461
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I'm missing people, so I could keep going, but.

181
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:54,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the reason why I ask, and it's good to hear you point out so many different folks, is because I think sometimes people have the impression that all of this stuff happens specifically in one place.

182
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:14,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know kind of name and all the different teams and all the different collaborations and services and everything It's really really quite an intricate web of service delivery that's taking place in the city Oh, yeah, and I think it's important for folks to see and know that yep our recreation department with our senior center and library you know those directors are great and them and

183
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:22,129
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan it our Board of Health with our Office of Prevention and Outreach, you know Nobody's ever perfect.

184
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:38,616
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot more we have to do but we You know, we're able to really work together doing a new we're almost done with our emergency management plan For the city, so we'll be prepared if there's a flood or if there's an environmental disaster We'll get in the Andrews ready

185
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:42,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this location is also a good one, too, in the Hegner Center.

186
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:53,833
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to map out where people can go to get what they need, water, food, services, and hopefully never need for housing, but emergency housing.

187
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:55,675
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, we're doing a lot of work.

188
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:57,546
[SPEAKER_01]: Very good, very good.

189
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:05,692
[SPEAKER_01]: What's surprising you right now about the goings on at City Hall, the work that you're doing?

190
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:10,395
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes you kind of go, woo, if anything?

191
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:24,174
[SPEAKER_00]: My day is filled with the, or half of my day, I guess, is filled with some of the HR pieces, which can be, whew, in themselves.

192
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:30,716
[SPEAKER_00]: But I always say that I drive home and then I think of all the good that people are doing.

193
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:34,917
[SPEAKER_00]: So not even just in City Hall, just throughout the community.

194
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:41,839
[SPEAKER_00]: All the boards and commission volunteers and people that are just working together, all the organizations we have in Medford, so really,

195
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:55,209
[SPEAKER_00]: blows my mind at how hard so many, not everybody, but so many people worked and and how many people just really work for the city that care about its future and care about the people of Medford and making sure that we do.

196
00:15:55,349 --> 00:16:01,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody does have what they need and everybody feels welcome and included in that process.

197
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:05,216
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's a large task, but we're working hard at it.

198
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:05,796
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, OK.

199
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,745
[SPEAKER_01]: You spoke a little bit about it when you were talking about your first term versus your second.

200
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:25,861
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask you, how has dealing with all you had to deal with going through the height of the COVID period, how has it changed the way that you approach governing the city?

201
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:43,124
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the one of the biggest things COVID did for me personally in my governance is helped not help stay prepared and ready and

202
00:16:44,105 --> 00:17:04,084
[SPEAKER_00]: have the for anything that comes our way so every day there's you know every week at least there's a crisis or two and just for me to stay calm cool and collected and you know even my communications director says how do you stay so calm like well I have to and

203
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,749
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to, so then my team does, and my team can stretch very far.

204
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:18,400
[SPEAKER_00]: But also because we have to be thoughtful, even if we have to act quickly, we still need to be thoughtful and think things through and work together.

205
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:25,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So staying calm is something that COVID taught me, because my first eight weeks I would go to bed at night going, I don't know if I can do this.

206
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:31,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the ABC is going to help the MBTA with the MAPC and the funding will come from the MT.

207
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:35,855
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just words that, you know, letter salad.

208
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:41,359
[SPEAKER_00]: But then Covid hit and just kind of had to slap myself across the face and say, it's time to lead.

209
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:41,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

210
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,120
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you can do this.

211
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:43,680
[SPEAKER_00]: And

212
00:17:44,941 --> 00:18:03,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, knowing that I could make the right decisions, not that everybody would be happy one way or another, but that I really thought things through and I took my time and when I had to, to do what I thought was the best and listen to both sides so I could figure out what was needed to be done to keep people healthy and safe is definitely

213
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:10,978
[SPEAKER_00]: helped me know how to manage stress, how to stay mentally ready.

214
00:18:10,998 --> 00:18:15,161
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably my best answer I have.

215
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:16,642
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good, it's good, it's good.

216
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:19,484
[SPEAKER_01]: What made you decide to run for another term?

217
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:30,539
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so we have so many things on our plate that are that are unfinished and so much more good to do.

218
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,662
[SPEAKER_00]: And I cannot could never leave the team that I have in place now.

219
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:48,130
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have from hopefully getting an MSBA loan to redo our flagship school, which is our high school, to carrying out continuing to carry out all these plans.

220
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,592
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep the team in place that we have.

221
00:18:53,213 --> 00:18:58,857
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to bed at night knowing the work was hard, but that I am doing the right thing.

222
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:03,060
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanna continue to lead this great community.

223
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay, fair enough, fair enough.

224
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:15,569
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that this is always subject to change, because the ground shifts under our feet all the time, but kind of what,

225
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,540
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your vision?

226
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,924
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your current vision as the sitting mayor?

227
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:31,573
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's your big hope for the progress or development or whatever it is in the city of Medford?

228
00:19:31,593 --> 00:19:32,494
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you hoping for?

229
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:36,215
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long list.

230
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:38,677
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know.

231
00:19:39,718 --> 00:19:41,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think I touched on it a little bit.

232
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:54,132
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need to continue making progress to make sure that everybody feels connected and included and welcome in this community.

233
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,273
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we want

234
00:19:55,714 --> 00:20:01,981
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure we're transparent in the process and that we get input and ideas from everybody.

235
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:06,847
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes with the liaisons and the connectors we have.

236
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:12,893
[SPEAKER_00]: They all speak multiple languages, or at least a second language, and they're out in our community building trust.

237
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:24,406
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that's like my overall vision, but you want to make sure people have what they need as far as we need to create more affordable housing.

238
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:29,412
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 500 units or so in production now, and we need to do our part.

239
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,656
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future, and then just basic needs.

240
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:44,153
[SPEAKER_00]: Transportation, you'll always see me out front leading and advocating for the residents of Medford to make sure that we have safe and reliable transportation, to food insecurity.

241
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:49,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the list goes on, but development's big.

242
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:59,233
[SPEAKER_00]: It's money that runs the city, so we're trying to boost economic growth and new growth numbers.

243
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:09,178
[SPEAKER_00]: We want those to be high so that we have money to spend on our schools and our library, on our parks and playgrounds and streets, and give our employees the raises they need.

244
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,935
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of components, but I just want to continue to make progress in a positive way.

245
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:18,825
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent, excellent.

246
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:33,236
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of my favorite new things in Medford, a lot of folks haven't had the opportunity to experience it as yet, and it still hasn't officially opened, but I managed to sneak in a tour about a week ago.

247
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:36,479
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the new Arts Center on Mystic Avenue.

248
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,640
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great space.

249
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about it a little bit?

250
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:41,082
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure, yeah.

251
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:42,684
[SPEAKER_00]: We are helping them right now.

252
00:21:42,704 --> 00:21:43,884
[SPEAKER_00]: We just signed the...

253
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:47,880
[SPEAKER_00]: what they needed with MassDOT, because they're doing some improvements on our roads.

254
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:54,774
[SPEAKER_00]: just months away from opening, so that'll be Theory Wellness and a beautiful new art center.

255
00:21:56,115 --> 00:22:08,059
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, too, take a tour, and it's gonna be a great space for local artists to be able to display art and do their work inside a building that everybody can enjoy.

256
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:14,421
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're so lucky to be able to hopefully open that in the next several months, and that's right on Mystic Ave.

257
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:15,462
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be amazing.

258
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:28,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so for those of you that haven't had an opportunity, you're going down Mystic Ave, right past, I think it's the, I hate to say it like this, the liquor store, is it?

259
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:29,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Atlas.

260
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:31,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Atlas, Atlas liquor store.

261
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:37,863
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a huge building, part of the building is a cannabis.

262
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:39,024
[SPEAKER_01]: Retail.

263
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:52,429
[SPEAKER_01]: retail called Dairy Wellness, and the front side actually, based on agreements that were negotiated by the mayor's administration, is a new art center.

264
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:56,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, beautiful building.

265
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:58,031
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll have artists' suites.

266
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:05,354
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll have a floor somewhat similar to this one for exhibitions, displays.

267
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:07,635
[SPEAKER_01]: performances, et cetera.

268
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:22,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's several entities that are kind of, you know, joining together, collaborating as kind of the governing bodies, including the Medford Arts Council and Arts Medford and Cache.

269
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:36,131
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gonna be a very collaborative space, and I think it really, really is a plum for the city, because it's been in discussion, some type of an art space like this, for years.

270
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:37,072
[SPEAKER_01]: For years, yes.

271
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:38,132
[SPEAKER_01]: For a long time.

272
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:39,053
[SPEAKER_01]: Exciting.

273
00:23:39,394 --> 00:23:46,660
[SPEAKER_01]: So, related to that, how do you see the arts enhancing life in the city, and what more would you like to see?

274
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:51,072
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we can always enhance the arts.

275
00:23:51,112 --> 00:23:53,835
[SPEAKER_00]: You were our first Poet Laureate.

276
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:57,220
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done, and that was just amazing.

277
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,823
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're our second one in.

278
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:02,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Vijaya is amazing as well.

279
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:03,447
[SPEAKER_00]: So she has a two-year term.

280
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:04,809
[SPEAKER_00]: We already know who the next...

281
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:08,390
[SPEAKER_00]: next will be because we have so many wonderful poets in Medford.

282
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,771
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm always working on a project, an arts mural.

283
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:13,351
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to take that on myself.

284
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,772
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done one at Tufts Pool.

285
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:17,572
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done it one at Wrights Pond.

286
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:22,153
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to, you know, I love the art that's popping up.

287
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,594
[SPEAKER_00]: Like Colleen's has Amelia Earhart on the wall.

288
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:27,535
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our

289
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:35,525
[SPEAKER_00]: I know West Medford Community Center has arts fairs, so we want to keep seeing those popping up.

290
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:41,072
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our holiday extravaganza where we'll have 40 art vendors.

291
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:45,037
[SPEAKER_00]: So bringing the arts into everything we do is probably our goal.

292
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:55,901
[SPEAKER_00]: And we love new ideas and we'll continue to push, support Arts Medford and the grants they give out and work with them on different things.

293
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,341
[SPEAKER_00]: We love that part of the job.

294
00:24:59,362 --> 00:25:00,862
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great part of the job, yeah.

295
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:09,624
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can have season tickets to the Bruins, the Red Sox, the Celtics, the Patriots or the New England Revolution.

296
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:11,465
[SPEAKER_01]: Who do you wanna go see and why?

297
00:25:14,332 --> 00:25:15,052
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a baller.

298
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:19,835
[SPEAKER_00]: I played basketball in high school and went into college playing basketball.

299
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:26,638
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would usually pick the Celtics, and that's kind of probably the most games I went to when I was young.

300
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:34,057
[SPEAKER_00]: But with two kids that play hockey, I may have to go Bruins.

301
00:25:34,557 --> 00:25:41,804
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe because I went to the game last night, my son's Medford Peewees, they skated a whole game at 4 o'clock.

302
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:44,947
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got to do it at TD Garden.

303
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:50,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my son's age, which is about nine, there was about 25 of them on the ice for the three minutes of fame.

304
00:25:50,812 --> 00:25:52,494
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the fastest three minutes that I've ever seen.

305
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:53,955
[SPEAKER_00]: seen on the ice.

306
00:25:53,995 --> 00:26:03,104
[SPEAKER_00]: They got on the ice, they got off the ice, but it was after the first period and the crowd was going crazy and then the game was tied, went into overtime, went into shootout.

307
00:26:03,124 --> 00:26:04,666
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty exciting.

308
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:06,488
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's on my brain right now.

309
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:07,569
[SPEAKER_00]: So just going with the Bruins.

310
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:08,429
[SPEAKER_00]: How about you?

311
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:11,613
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's funny.

312
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:15,517
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a basketball kid too.

313
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:20,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I played one year at Medford High on the freshman team.

314
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:24,166
[SPEAKER_01]: My brother was really good.

315
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:25,808
[SPEAKER_01]: My older brother was really good.

316
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:29,532
[SPEAKER_01]: He played for the varsity and played a little bit in college.

317
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:35,888
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like baseball.

318
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:41,878
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of a baseball historian with the Negro Leagues and everything.

319
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:44,402
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like the Red Sox.

320
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:58,948
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think right now, I'd probably go with you to the Celtics game, because their team looks really, really tasty this year.

321
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,929
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a good season.

322
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's going to be a good season.

323
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,031
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a good season.

324
00:27:05,572 --> 00:27:08,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Three words your husband David would use to describe you.

325
00:27:11,598 --> 00:27:13,559
[SPEAKER_01]: Good ones or bad ones?

326
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,280
[SPEAKER_01]: Whichever ones you feel comfortable talking about.

327
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:23,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardworking, caring, stubborn.

328
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:29,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would he call you stubborn?

329
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:32,609
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm pretty set in my ways.

330
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,210
[SPEAKER_01]: You want what you want.

331
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:36,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

332
00:27:36,568 --> 00:27:46,282
[SPEAKER_01]: okay okay all right three words you would use to describe David oh geez amazing father

333
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,651
[SPEAKER_00]: nonstop go-getter.

334
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:56,252
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's also a very, very hard worker.

335
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, okay.

336
00:27:58,373 --> 00:27:58,853
[SPEAKER_01]: Good.

337
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:03,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like you guys, well, you know, in 15 years, it's pretty well-matched.

338
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty well-matched, okay.

339
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:13,818
[SPEAKER_01]: So what new things are you excited about working on in a potential new term as mayor?

340
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:15,499
[SPEAKER_00]: New things.

341
00:28:21,744 --> 00:28:22,570
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of new things.

342
00:28:28,303 --> 00:28:46,186
[SPEAKER_00]: I think furthering the work with our diversity equity inclusion director at our Office of Prevention and Outreach with our liaisons and connectors and expanding how we communicate with all of our residents.

343
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:55,828
[SPEAKER_00]: So I see that being, you know, we're we're doing we're applying for another municipal vulnerability preparedness grant and a bar foundation grant.

344
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:56,068
[SPEAKER_00]: So

345
00:28:56,688 --> 00:29:01,070
[SPEAKER_00]: getting more funds to be able to continue that work and get more things translated.

346
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:06,832
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're working with hopefully going to sign a contract with an ASL interpreter.

347
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:18,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just furthering that welcoming, inclusive feeling for everybody, because I think that is a missing piece, especially for those that don't speak English.

348
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:22,477
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure that we're reaching every part of our community.

349
00:29:22,497 --> 00:29:24,337
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so that's that's one thing.

350
00:29:24,377 --> 00:29:25,138
[SPEAKER_01]: But very good.

351
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:32,043
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't want to really speak it into the universe, but I feel like I need to ask.

352
00:29:33,024 --> 00:29:39,712
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to leave the mayor's office, what would you do and what would you miss?

353
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:42,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

354
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:44,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Thought through that.

355
00:29:44,712 --> 00:29:47,995
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what my next step is.

356
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:49,736
[SPEAKER_00]: People always ask, what are you going to do next?

357
00:29:49,776 --> 00:29:50,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going to go?

358
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:51,358
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

359
00:29:51,418 --> 00:29:54,321
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to live in the moment and take one thing at a time.

360
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:59,185
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would always potentially have teaching on that list.

361
00:29:59,525 --> 00:29:59,786
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

362
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:00,446
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

363
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Take six months off and be with my kids, maybe.

364
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,054
[SPEAKER_00]: Relax a minute, probably be on my list.

365
00:30:11,124 --> 00:30:12,246
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was the second part of the question?

366
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:14,229
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you miss?

367
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:16,433
[SPEAKER_00]: I would miss the people.

368
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:17,234
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

369
00:30:17,394 --> 00:30:18,757
[SPEAKER_00]: And that includes everybody.

370
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:22,964
[SPEAKER_00]: That includes people I work with, residents that I talk to.

371
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:30,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how I would not be able to be as busy as I am now.

372
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:38,979
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would miss the everyday trying to solve problems, trying to help people, because that's why I do the job.

373
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:39,559
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

374
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:40,220
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

375
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good.

376
00:30:44,827 --> 00:30:46,429
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, here's something.

377
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:59,883
[SPEAKER_01]: What would people who are kind of meeting you for the first time or encountering either Breonna the person or Breonna the mayor, what would they be surprised to learn about you?

378
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a secret.

379
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:12,499
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

380
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:17,660
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.

381
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,621
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

382
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:21,641
[SPEAKER_00]: I I'm pretty I'm a pretty open book.

383
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:24,822
[SPEAKER_00]: I people are always surprised that I am the mayor when I walk.

384
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:31,163
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they don't recognize me, especially if I have a hat on or I'm yet.

385
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:31,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

386
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:33,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Just have my my hair up.

387
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:38,725
[SPEAKER_00]: And they they're surprised at my age, you know, leading a city of 60000 people.

388
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:42,166
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to do it as best I can.

389
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:46,428
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think that through.

390
00:31:46,548 --> 00:31:54,232
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we can always come back to it or have you come back another time, no problem.

391
00:31:54,852 --> 00:32:05,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So what continues to surprise you about the new people and families and residents as you go about doing all the different things that you're doing in the city?

392
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:07,838
[SPEAKER_01]: What surprises you about Medford Folk?

393
00:32:09,114 --> 00:32:13,480
[SPEAKER_00]: Amid for folks are then they have been.

394
00:32:14,984 --> 00:32:20,105
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been more engaged than I've ever seen it before, which is great.

395
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,986
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of young families moving in.

396
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:29,547
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of people getting involved and wanting to be active in the community.

397
00:32:29,587 --> 00:32:40,669
[SPEAKER_00]: I am trying to diversify boards, but also bring in people that have never served on boards and commissions before you see so many people applying to just be part of the community.

398
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,290
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeing how engaged people are.

399
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:47,953
[SPEAKER_00]: and how willing people are to help make the change that needs to be made.

400
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:53,356
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good thing for the city to have folks from everywhere involved.

401
00:32:54,697 --> 00:33:00,661
[SPEAKER_01]: As I look across the spectrum of things that are going on in the city,

402
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:17,281
[SPEAKER_01]: that's probably the greatest hope that I have, is that people can feel, people who have traditionally been disconnected, for whatever reason, can start to feel more connected to all of the different things that are happening in the life of the city.

403
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:25,269
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's really a lot here for folks if they just take advantage of it.

404
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:32,836
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I fuss with my constituents all the time about kind of staying engaged and staying involved.

405
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:34,918
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to beat them to get them out the door.

406
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:35,259
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so.

407
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,105
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit of a serious question.

408
00:33:44,186 --> 00:34:02,320
[SPEAKER_01]: What types of conversations have the events in Lewiston, Maine in particular, what kind of conversations are you beginning to have or have you had with law enforcement and public health related to the safety in the city?

409
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:09,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I mentioned earlier, we have been working.

410
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:17,895
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been about a year now working with the MAPC Metropolitan Action Planning Council on an emergency management plan.

411
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:23,361
[SPEAKER_00]: So just two weeks ago, we had almost every director, including

412
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:31,927
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives from Armstrong Ambulance and Tufts University in a room, and we were going through a scenario, a what-if scenario.

413
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,187
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went through it.

414
00:34:33,308 --> 00:34:45,576
[SPEAKER_00]: It was two hours long, and we had to answer questions and be ready to, each table had to roundtable what their department would be doing if X or Y were to happen.

415
00:34:45,676 --> 00:34:47,957
[SPEAKER_00]: So that plan is huge.

416
00:34:48,478 --> 00:34:53,441
[SPEAKER_00]: We also are working on the security within the school system.

417
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:56,142
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's good to ask, yeah.

418
00:34:56,383 --> 00:34:58,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Active shooter planning, potentially?

419
00:34:59,044 --> 00:35:19,816
[SPEAKER_00]: They have drills that they do, but me, I'm trying to oversee, from my seat in the mayor's office, making sure if we need security upgrades, right now we're working on, don't get into the details, but we're working on making sure everything is working and we have protocols in place.

420
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:24,438
[SPEAKER_00]: for who can and cannot enter the buildings, things like that.

421
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:28,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's what happened in Maine is, I just was watching the news before I got here.

422
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,601
[SPEAKER_00]: It's devastating.

423
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:31,181
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.

424
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:32,201
[SPEAKER_01]: It absolutely is.

425
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:41,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I mean, it's a question that I really wasn't gonna ask, but right now it seems really important.

426
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:42,866
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would have been derelict of me not to.

427
00:35:43,506 --> 00:35:44,046
[SPEAKER_00]: to ask.

428
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:48,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's been going on around the country in all different places.

429
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:52,049
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just Maine has hit real close to home.

430
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:52,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

431
00:35:52,910 --> 00:36:03,754
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's good to know that you're having the conversations and that the city is not kind of taking a backseat to any other city and talking about it seriously.

432
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:04,554
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

433
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:13,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Any questions you want to ask me or anything you want to ask about the community center that I might be able to answer?

434
00:36:17,253 --> 00:36:41,450
[SPEAKER_01]: two questions I guess okay what is your favorite what's a your favorite poem you've ever written and and and how did you get into writing poetry okay so see I'm it's it's for me it's easy because I only have one child right so it's not like choosing between my children you know which one I like best I you know I don't know if I have a favorite

435
00:36:43,027 --> 00:36:43,567
[SPEAKER_01]: poem.

436
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:47,790
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of them that I really, really like.

437
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to write about West Medford.

438
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:53,773
[SPEAKER_01]: It's given me a lot of inspiration.

439
00:36:54,374 --> 00:37:03,099
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think probably the poem that has the greatest notoriety is the piece that I wrote called Hired by the Mystic.

440
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:13,166
[SPEAKER_01]: that talks about the growth and development of the early West Medford community, because that's the piece that got me muralized down on Mystic Ave.

441
00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:14,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Congratulations, yeah, that's beautiful.

442
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:25,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can't not love that, because I think it kind of speaks to what this community is and what it continues to evolve into.

443
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:29,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would probably be my favorite poem.

444
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:33,679
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard that one, yeah, great, love it.

445
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:37,020
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, or the one that people seem to know the best.

446
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:57,626
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of how I got into writing the poetry, Medford really gets credit for this, because I was in high school, I was 16-ish maybe, and had an English teacher, nice Greek lady, her name was Eleanor Koukouvatis, and she gave me a small volume of Langston Hughes's poetry.

447
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:02,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And up until that point, I didn't know that black people wrote poetry.

448
00:38:02,968 --> 00:38:03,708
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew about one.

449
00:38:03,768 --> 00:38:05,229
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew about Phyllis Wheatley.

450
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:12,391
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't know that there was this whole panorama of African-American literature.

451
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,892
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was the first time that I got exposed to it.

452
00:38:15,513 --> 00:38:25,236
[SPEAKER_01]: And for anyone that really wants to kind of get into poetry in any meaningful way, you read Robert Frost.

453
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:27,177
[SPEAKER_01]: You read Langston Hughes.

454
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:35,504
[SPEAKER_01]: You read William Shakespeare, wonderful poet, playwright, and all kinds of other things.

455
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:47,534
[SPEAKER_01]: You read maybe Keats, and Woodworth, or Shelley, or Robert Burns, if you want to go back into the old stuff.

456
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:49,496
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to the Greeks.

457
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,256
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to Ovid.

458
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:57,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, there's just so much.

459
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:18,236
[SPEAKER_01]: But Langston Hughes basically was able to take bits and pieces of poetry from very early poetry, African American poetry, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, through the most contemporary stuff that was being done at the time.

460
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was really at the center of the Harlem Renaissance.

461
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:25,761
[SPEAKER_01]: And his poetry is beautiful, and if I can get

462
00:39:27,043 --> 00:39:30,869
[SPEAKER_01]: anywhere near close to that, I'll be a happy, happy person.

463
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,117
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm at book six, and this is my shameless plug.

464
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,784
[SPEAKER_01]: This one just, this is hot off the presses, literally.

465
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:48,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of people that helped me get it published, so I'm, you know, I got a whole bunch of people that I gotta get books out to.

466
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,631
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's now available.

467
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:55,875
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna do a book night on November 18th here at the Community Center.

468
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:57,796
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna be my official book release.

469
00:39:58,577 --> 00:40:05,362
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we'll read a bunch of stuff and have a good time with the,

470
00:40:05,962 --> 00:40:12,345
[SPEAKER_01]: former Poet Laureate of Medford, but the Poet Laureate Emeritus, because I was the first one.

471
00:40:13,406 --> 00:40:14,747
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm claiming that title.

472
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:16,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Any parting thoughts?

473
00:40:17,068 --> 00:40:18,048
[SPEAKER_01]: Any last words?

474
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:19,809
[SPEAKER_00]: No, thank you for having me.

475
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:22,151
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to everybody who came to listen.

476
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:26,513
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure the music's going to be beautiful after, which is part of the reason why you came.

477
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:28,414
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, no, thank you for having me.

478
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:29,574
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.

479
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:30,395
[SPEAKER_00]: I love coming.

480
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:31,035
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

481
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:32,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

482
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:40,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, thank you for bringing kind of an evolving perspective and really deep experience to the table this evening.

483
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,242
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a really critical time in the life of all American cities right now.

484
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:55,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So to have sane, sober, and hopeful leadership is sorely needed at every level of government.

485
00:40:56,447 --> 00:41:03,312
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, on behalf of the community center, certainly, we wish you all the best in terms of next week's election.

486
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:13,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm particularly hopeful that all eligible residents of the city are anxious to vote and be represented as part of the solution.

487
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,826
[SPEAKER_01]: And to everyone watching out there, thanks so much for your attentiveness and your interest in this discussion.

[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so A Life in Music, Lost and Found, My Journey as a Musician with Hearing Loss.

535
00:49:58,601 --> 00:50:04,827
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be what we call a talk and play presentation by a woman by the name of Betty Houck.

536
00:50:05,487 --> 00:50:08,130
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a violinist and a viola player.

537
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,072
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be on Thursday, November 16th at 11 a.m.

538
00:50:14,335 --> 00:50:27,721
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for 50 years, Betty has enjoyed a rich and rewarding career as a professional violist, until the day she realized that she had to retire because of progressive hearing loss.

539
00:50:28,121 --> 00:50:31,642
[SPEAKER_01]: For three years, she completely turned her back on music.

540
00:50:32,123 --> 00:50:40,206
[SPEAKER_01]: In this talk and play presentation, she tells the story of how various twists and turns led her back into sharing the joy of music,

541
00:50:40,686 --> 00:50:44,288
[SPEAKER_01]: while educating and advocating for those with hearing loss.

542
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:54,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Her talk is punctuated by short musical selections on both the violin and the viola, and the program is about one hour and includes Q&A at the end.

543
00:50:54,892 --> 00:50:56,193
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be fascinating.

544
00:50:56,693 --> 00:51:05,557
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to come out for an afternoon of talk and play, come see Betty in A Life in Music Lost

545
00:51:07,138 --> 00:51:07,458
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

[SPEAKER_01]: So, my friends, it's time to turn our attention to the lyrical miracle we've engaged for this side of the ledger.

552
00:51:48,824 --> 00:51:54,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Tonight, as I said on the flyer advertising the evening, old friends are the best.

553

[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

569
00:53:52,749 --> 00:53:53,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

570
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:53,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

571
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:53,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

572
00:53:53,989 --> 00:53:54,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

573
00:53:54,389 --> 00:53:54,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

574
00:53:54,849 --> 00:53:55,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

575
00:53:55,850 --> 00:54:03,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this was kind of a short notice request that my friend Terry is

576
00:54:04,096 --> 00:54:05,657
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to do this.

577
00:54:05,677 --> 00:54:09,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew I was going to make that fall, but I'm going to come up off this right here.

578
00:54:09,959 --> 00:54:12,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that OK if I come off the rug?

579
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:17,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I leave the mic on the rug for best sound quality?

580
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:17,823
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

581
00:54:18,784 --> 00:54:20,005
[SPEAKER_03]: I just feel so far away.

582
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:23,887
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I want to jump on y'all.

583
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:33,492
[SPEAKER_03]: You spoke a fisk.

584
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,543
[SPEAKER_03]: I just came back from Nashville.

585
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:47,192
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a, the Fisk Jubilee Singers has a day, Jubilee 6th every year.

586
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:50,435
[SPEAKER_03]: It's called Jubilee Day and they do a,

587
00:54:52,177 --> 00:54:59,802
[SPEAKER_03]: a convocation which this year was, the speaker was Justin, is it Justin Jackson?

588
00:55:01,243 --> 00:55:06,146
[SPEAKER_03]: The young man who's in the House of Representatives and who was shut down.

589
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:14,812
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the speaker that morning for the convocation and many of the alumni were in attendance.

590
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:21,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of the students at the college were in attendance because he's famous.

591
00:55:22,774 --> 00:55:33,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the word that I want you to think about, is fame and glory versus the behind-the-scenes story.

592
00:55:34,463 --> 00:55:45,531
[SPEAKER_03]: As you leave here, I want you to think about not being afraid to stay behind the scenes, to be just part of the fabric, not to have to be the

593
00:55:47,162 --> 00:55:52,586
[SPEAKER_03]: gold thread that's going through the sequin, because, you know, sequins fall off.

594
00:55:54,507 --> 00:55:56,949
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not preaching.

595
00:55:57,189 --> 00:56:06,796
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying I came from Fisk this past maybe three weeks ago, and there was so much desire for

596
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:14,033
[SPEAKER_03]: affirmation, acclamation, glory, news, making the news.

597
00:56:15,073 --> 00:56:24,858
[SPEAKER_03]: And I feel like sometimes we forget about our foundations and who we are and who we were before we started growing and getting so big.

598
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:29,240
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the things that made us, put us on the map start suffering.

599
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,822
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of those things at this school is the Fisk Jubilee Singers.

600
00:56:33,082 --> 00:56:34,903
[SPEAKER_03]: We are currently without a leader.

601
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:57,240
[SPEAKER_03]: just hired a leader, that is not, for me, that's gonna be the best thing about the whole experience as the Jubilee singers over the next few years, if they are capable of taking on not only the musical challenges,

602
00:56:59,597 --> 00:57:11,600
[SPEAKER_03]: but also the creative challenges, the directional challenges, because the Negro spiritual started the Jubilee Singers and made them famous.

603
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Nashville is known as Music City because of the Fisk Jubilee Singers.

604
00:57:19,681 --> 00:57:21,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can't let the spiritual die.

605
00:57:23,726 --> 00:57:34,952
[SPEAKER_03]: We have got to learn how to move the spiritual in an arena, into an arena of modernness, of relating from a modern level.

606
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:48,180
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means everybody's gotta be invited into the experience of oppression, liberation, struggle, joy, theft, creative rights,

607
00:57:50,013 --> 00:57:51,157
[SPEAKER_03]: women's autonomy.

608
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, don't get me started.

609
00:57:53,486 --> 00:57:53,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

610
00:57:56,229 --> 00:58:09,598
[SPEAKER_03]: I just was, I really wanted to honor, just thank you for mentioning Fisk, because I'm so proud of my alma mater, and it's a long, very strange story that I have.

611
00:58:10,158 --> 00:58:14,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I never told you my story with Fisk, but I'll talk to you about it.

612
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:16,442
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna mess you up.

613
00:58:17,423 --> 00:58:19,184
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna mess you up, okay?

614
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:19,525
[SPEAKER_03]: So.

615
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:28,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I usually come and I sing some spirituals and some gospel and I ain't doing that tonight.

616
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:30,891
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not doing that tonight.

617
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:56,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Sittin' in the morning sun

618
00:58:57,857 --> 00:59:06,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be sitting when the evening comes, watching the ships roll in.

619
00:59:07,283 --> 00:59:11,826
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I'll watch them roll away again.

620
00:59:12,387 --> 00:59:20,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sitting on the dock of the bay, watching the tide roll away.

621
00:59:22,193 --> 00:59:26,536
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sitting on the dock of the bay, wasting time.

622
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:40,527
[SPEAKER_03]: I left my home in Kentucky, headed for the Frisco Bay.

623
00:59:40,547 --> 00:59:44,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had nothing to live for.

624
00:59:45,931 --> 01:00:06,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Looked like nothing gonna come my way So I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay Watching the tide roll away I'm sitting on the dock of the bay Wasting time

625
01:00:11,493 --> 01:00:15,255
[SPEAKER_04]: look like nothing's gonna change.

626
01:00:16,436 --> 01:00:19,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything still remains the same.

627
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:29,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't do what 10 people tell me to do, so I guess I'll remain the same, yeah.

628
01:00:29,765 --> 01:00:37,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Sitting here resting my bones, and this loneliness won't leave me alone.

629
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:38,711
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no.

630
01:00:39,491 --> 01:00:47,398
[SPEAKER_03]: 2,000 miles I roamed just to make this dock my home.

631
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:56,965
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay, watching the tide roll away.

632
01:00:58,567 --> 01:01:04,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sitting on the dock of the bay, wasting time.

633
01:01:36,394 --> 01:01:36,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

634
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,722
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

635
01:01:43,162 --> 01:01:44,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

636
01:01:46,426 --> 01:01:52,053
[SPEAKER_03]: We've come too far to think about turning around.

637
01:01:53,474 --> 01:01:56,178
[SPEAKER_03]: At some point in life, you get so far into the journey.

638
01:01:58,530 --> 01:01:59,231
[SPEAKER_03]: That what do we do?

639
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:03,516
[SPEAKER_03]: We're over halfway past the hardest part.

640
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:06,440
[SPEAKER_03]: So why would we think about giving up now?

641
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:12,988
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it looks like a long, long time before we're going to make it.

642
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:17,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's probably going to be a long time and a hard journey still ahead.

643
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:25,946
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you turn around and not ever know the outcome of your sacrifice?

644
01:02:26,706 --> 01:02:28,788
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to keep on going.

645
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:40,678
[SPEAKER_04]: We've come this far by faith.

646
01:02:44,737 --> 01:02:58,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Leaning on the Lord, trusting in his holy word.

647

[SPEAKER_03]: He's never failed me yet.

648
01:03:05,467 --> 01:03:06,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone that knows it?

649
01:03:07,468 --> 01:03:07,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoa.

01:05:54,473 --> 01:05:56,994
Y'all can join in on this next one, too.

673
01:05:57,054 --> 01:05:57,955
No, I'm kidding.

674
01:05:58,035 --> 01:05:59,235
I just sang last week.

675
01:06:19,386 --> 01:06:36,352
[SPEAKER_03]: in a very important homegoing for the former president of Berkeley, whose father formed and founded the school for local musicians, professional musicians, to learn about the jazz idiom.

676
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:39,313
[SPEAKER_03]: And many, many years

677
01:06:40,174 --> 01:06:58,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Later, his son took over the throttle and led the school into hiring much more progressive, musically diverse, like me, people who were in the industry.

678
01:06:59,745 --> 01:07:01,326
[SPEAKER_03]: And I owe this man a lot.

679
01:07:01,547 --> 01:07:10,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Lee Burke and his wife were very beautiful, beautiful hosts to me my whole time at Berkeley.

680
01:07:11,335 --> 01:07:18,601
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I sang this song at that funeral.

681
01:07:20,042 --> 01:07:23,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I get emotional, just go with me.

682
01:07:28,638 --> 01:07:53,367
[SPEAKER_03]: beams of heaven as I go through this wilderness below guide my feet

683
01:07:56,399 --> 01:08:20,542
[SPEAKER_03]: in peaceful ways turn my midnights into days when in the darkness I would grope

684
01:08:21,721 --> 01:08:33,605
[SPEAKER_06]: Faith always sees a ray of hope.

685
01:08:34,525 --> 01:08:46,569
[SPEAKER_03]: And soon from all life's grief and danger, I shall be free.

686
01:08:51,215 --> 01:08:54,317
[SPEAKER_04]: someday.

687
01:08:56,018 --> 01:09:10,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I do not know how long till we'll be or what the future

688
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:38,778
[SPEAKER_04]: The future holds for me But this I know If Jesus leads me I shall be free I shall see God

689
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:44,251
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see my mother.

690
01:09:45,151 --> 01:09:48,792
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see my father.

691
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:53,133
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see my sister.

692
01:09:53,713 --> 01:09:57,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll see my brother.

693
01:09:58,854 --> 01:10:09,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I shall get home some, some day.

694
01:10:12,645 --> 01:10:26,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.

695
01:10:33,092 --> 01:10:36,333
[SPEAKER_03]: I really sing very seriously, but I'm a goof.

696
01:10:37,573 --> 01:10:38,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a real goof.

697
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:41,915
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up being a goof.

698
01:10:42,395 --> 01:10:43,816
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to a doctor yesterday.

699
01:10:44,917 --> 01:10:48,179
[SPEAKER_03]: If you notice, my right shoulder is higher than the left shoulder.

700
01:10:48,759 --> 01:10:52,161
[SPEAKER_03]: You notice that I'm not leaning consciously.

701
01:10:52,621 --> 01:10:54,062
[SPEAKER_03]: He just said, walk down the hall.

702
01:10:54,122 --> 01:10:55,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, OK.

703
01:10:55,483 --> 01:10:56,544
[SPEAKER_03]: And I walked down the hall.

704
01:10:56,564 --> 01:10:57,244
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, OK.

705
01:10:58,165 --> 01:11:00,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we got a lot of work to do.

706
01:11:01,687 --> 01:11:04,268
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to be adjusted by a chiropractic.

707
01:11:04,308 --> 01:11:05,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's not a chiropractic.

708
01:11:05,789 --> 01:11:08,751
[SPEAKER_03]: His technical term is kinesiologist.

709
01:11:10,865 --> 01:11:15,407
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was a new and learning experience for me because I did not get one bone cracked.

710
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:27,351
[SPEAKER_03]: I left there with a bunch of exercises and muscle assignments to do up against the door to strengthen my left side of my body.

711
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:29,751
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, your left side is just weak, weak, weak.

712
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:34,253
[SPEAKER_03]: This thigh is just, this muscle is not, and here's what you're gonna do.

713
01:11:34,713 --> 01:11:37,114
[SPEAKER_03]: And he gave me these things, you lay on this and you,

714
01:11:38,414 --> 01:11:39,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It was amazing.

715
01:11:39,555 --> 01:11:44,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And when he got finished showing me how to do the exercise, I was feeling better.

716
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:47,420
[SPEAKER_03]: When I left the place, I felt great.

717
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,442
[SPEAKER_03]: I felt 10 years younger.

718
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:54,205
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, I went home and sat down in front of the television.

719
01:11:57,005 --> 01:12:10,654
[SPEAKER_03]: started with Netflix and then I caught myself and I'm like, oh, OK, wait, wait, wait.

720
01:12:11,015 --> 01:12:16,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me move to the other side of the sofa.

721
01:12:16,759 --> 01:12:19,080
[SPEAKER_03]: So pray for me because it's a journey.

722
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:20,601
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a destination.

723
01:12:20,661 --> 01:12:22,262
[SPEAKER_03]: This is not my destination.

724
01:12:22,923 --> 01:12:25,064
[SPEAKER_03]: This is me seeing you on my journey.

725
01:12:27,846 --> 01:12:29,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

726
01:12:33,128 --> 01:12:34,028
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you want to hear next?

727
01:12:34,429 --> 01:12:38,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Something church or something?

728
01:12:41,512 --> 01:12:42,492
[SPEAKER_03]: Church is fine?

729
01:12:43,112 --> 01:12:43,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you said?

730
01:12:44,953 --> 01:12:45,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Something joyful?

731
01:12:47,914 --> 01:12:48,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Something joyful.

732
01:12:52,496 --> 01:12:53,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Something joyful.

733
01:12:55,313 --> 01:13:01,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Something joyful, let me see, oh.

734
01:13:01,455 --> 01:13:07,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see, how about, this is called His Name's So Sweet.

735
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:13,159
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a spiritual, and it has a call and response, so.

736
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:19,021
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanna teach you the middle part of it.

737
01:13:19,201 --> 01:13:24,043
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to sing, all you have to do is say, yes, yes, I do love my Jesus.

738
01:13:25,691 --> 01:13:31,516
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to sing it, although there is parts, but yes, yes, I do love my Jesus, okay?

739
01:13:32,296 --> 01:13:37,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me see, let me put it in a key that I can sing it in.

740
01:13:37,761 --> 01:13:43,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a soprano lead singer in this song when I was 20, 19, 18, 21, but now I'm 68 and I'm singing more like Billy Eckstine.

741
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:45,226

[SPEAKER_03]: That's what that song is about.

[SPEAKER_03]: Do you love Jesus?

816
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:49,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Zid and Elder, that's the preacher, the presiding elder.

817
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:52,360
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, yes, yes, I do love my Jesus.

818
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,582

819
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:56,443
[SPEAKER_03]: He says, yes, yes.

820
01:17:56,543 --> 01:17:58,945
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the sinners are louder than everybody else.

821
01:18:00,266 --> 01:18:01,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna preach on y'all.

822
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:05,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me started.

823
01:18:09,735 --> 01:18:10,135
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

824
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:18,042
[SPEAKER_03]: So I chose some songs that are just near and dear to my heart that I've known since I was like 12, 13.

825
01:18:18,302 --> 01:18:22,106
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm going to sing one of those for you.

826
01:18:24,668 --> 01:18:26,450
[SPEAKER_03]: This song was first recorded by

827
01:18:29,266 --> 01:18:36,810
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, it was so far back, but the person who made it famous for the African-American community was Donny Hathaway.

828
01:18:39,432 --> 01:18:45,135
[SPEAKER_03]: And it started out with a really lovely piano thing, and I'm practicing.

829
01:18:46,876 --> 01:18:49,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Just so you know, I might do it for you next time I'm coming.

830
01:18:50,598 --> 01:18:51,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Lies.

831
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,020
[SPEAKER_03]: It says...

832
01:18:57,612 --> 01:19:05,334
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been so many places in my life and time.

833
01:19:07,654 --> 01:19:10,775
[SPEAKER_03]: I sung a lot of songs.

834
01:19:12,376 --> 01:19:17,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I've made some bad rhymes.

835
01:19:18,397 --> 01:19:26,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I've acted out my life in stages with 10,000 people watching.

836
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:36,031
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you.

837
01:19:37,733 --> 01:19:44,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I know your image of me is what I hope to be.

838
01:19:45,419 --> 01:19:46,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye, Mayor.

839
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,083
[SPEAKER_03]: I treated you unkindly.

840
01:19:51,444 --> 01:19:53,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, can't you see?

841
01:19:55,981 --> 01:19:58,662
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no one more important to me.

842
01:19:58,682 --> 01:20:05,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Baby, can't you see through me?

843
01:20:05,184 --> 01:20:13,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.

844
01:20:15,888 --> 01:20:18,229
[SPEAKER_03]: You taught me precious secrets.

845
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:44,679
[SPEAKER_03]: ♪ For the truth withholding nothing ♪ ♪ You came out in front and I was hiding ♪ ♪ But now I'm so much better ♪ ♪ And if my words don't come together ♪ ♪ Listen to the melody ♪

846
01:20:46,052 --> 01:21:13,809

848
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:30,243
[SPEAKER_04]: And when my life is over, remember when we were here together.

849
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:38,386
[SPEAKER_03]: We were alone and I was singing my song.

850
01:21:40,886 --> 01:21:48,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I was singing my song I was singing my song for you

851
01:22:23,786 --> 01:22:24,347
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm finished.

852
01:22:28,812 --> 01:22:29,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?

853
01:22:30,534 --> 01:22:30,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Skylar?

854
01:22:31,054 --> 01:22:31,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Skylar.

855
01:22:32,316 --> 01:22:33,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't have told you that.

856
01:22:34,178 --> 01:22:35,459
[SPEAKER_03]: She saw my list.

857
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:37,201
[SPEAKER_03]: She saw my list.

858
01:22:39,822 --> 01:22:49,829
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see I'm struggling with stuff with the post-COVID attitude.

859
01:22:50,289 --> 01:22:51,050
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I call it.

860
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:53,491
[SPEAKER_03]: My bronchial system got an attitude.

861
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:57,274
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you didn't protect yourself, and now I'm going to pay.

862
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:08,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so, please forgive me, but I hope you, I sing with the same spirit whether my voice is working or not, because I don't believe I'm singing from here.

863
01:23:08,602 --> 01:23:09,904
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe I'm singing from here.

864
01:23:11,425 --> 01:23:12,667
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always sung from here.

865
01:23:13,286 --> 01:23:14,387
[SPEAKER_03]: more than any other thing.

866
01:23:14,427 --> 01:23:19,531
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've always, wherever I was, no matter what I sang, it was always from here.

867
01:23:19,872 --> 01:23:28,799
[SPEAKER_03]: And then let people judge or critique or comment on the instrumental prowess or lack thereof.

868
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:36,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the instrument, the main instrument that I use is here, is my soul, my heart, okay?

869
01:23:38,905 --> 01:23:44,390
[SPEAKER_03]: With that said, let's see.

870
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:45,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember.

871
01:23:45,651 --> 01:23:46,271
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me think.

872
01:23:47,052 --> 01:23:48,513
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to sing this really high.

873
01:23:48,573 --> 01:23:53,077
[SPEAKER_05]: Skylark, have you anything to say to me?

874
01:23:53,177 --> 01:23:54,378
[SPEAKER_03]: But that ain't going to work tonight.

875
01:23:57,381 --> 01:24:06,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Skylark, have you anything to say to me?

876
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:27,920
[SPEAKER_03]: can you tell me where my love can be is there a shadow in the mist where someone's waiting to be kissed Skylar

877
01:24:29,268 --> 01:24:52,460
[SPEAKER_03]: have you seen a valley green with spring where my heart can go a journey in over the meadows in the lane through a blossom covered lane and in your lonely flight

878
01:24:54,977 --> 01:25:09,889
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't you heard the music in the night wonderful music faint as the will of the wisp crazy

879
01:25:13,135 --> 01:25:21,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon, oh.

880
01:25:21,861 --> 01:25:24,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Should I take the key down so I'll make it through the next bridge?

881
01:25:27,004 --> 01:25:34,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Skylark, I don't know if you can find these things.

882
01:25:35,362 --> 01:25:39,626
[SPEAKER_03]: But my heart is riding on your wings.

883
01:25:40,507 --> 01:25:47,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you see them anywhere, won't you lead me there?

884
01:25:47,213 --> 01:25:47,253
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

885
01:26:09,887 --> 01:26:13,689
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the worst sound I've made tonight, and you gave me the longest applause.

886
01:26:13,749 --> 01:26:16,351
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's something to that.

887
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:23,375
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'll get really sick for the next gig and sing through a lot of phlegm and have it just come up while I'm singing.

888
01:26:23,915 --> 01:26:28,358
[SPEAKER_03]: That seems to turn folks on.

889
01:26:28,518 --> 01:26:31,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Even great singers can screw up.

890
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, really can do what?

891
01:26:34,241 --> 01:26:34,462
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

892
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:41,659
[SPEAKER_03]: He's laughing at me, oh my God.

893
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:50,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody online watching from their homes in the comfort of their homes, this looks like something easy to do, but this is not an easy gig.

894
01:26:52,666 --> 01:27:02,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if it was nobody in the room, but the camera takes all of the chance for humanity, for flaw.

895
01:27:08,436 --> 01:27:12,817
[SPEAKER_03]: and smashes it in your face and says, you thought you was going to sing good tonight, didn't you?

896
01:27:12,937 --> 01:27:13,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

897
01:27:13,418 --> 01:27:13,958
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, watch this.

898
01:27:17,339 --> 01:27:19,339
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I think my throat is doing tonight.

899
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:19,720
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

900
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:24,181
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

901
01:27:24,201 --> 01:27:25,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So what was Skylark?

902
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:32,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is one that I, it's kind of a

903
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:37,820
[SPEAKER_03]: challenging, so let me see if I can make it through.

904
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:53,910
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called, You Must Believe in Spring, which is perfect because we're heading into winter, and it says, it's just encouragement for holding on to the next change of seasons.

905
01:27:55,632 --> 01:28:10,828
[SPEAKER_03]: When lonely feelings chill the meadows of your mind, just think if winter comes can spring be far behind?

906
01:28:14,251 --> 01:28:32,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Beneath the deepest snows, a secret of the rose is merely that it knows you must be leaving spring.

907
01:28:34,864 --> 01:28:41,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as the tree is sure its leaves will reappear,

908
01:28:42,987 --> 01:28:51,432
[SPEAKER_03]: It knows its emptiness is just the time of year.

909
01:28:51,973 --> 01:29:00,678
[SPEAKER_03]: The frozen mountain dreams of April's melting streams.

910
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:04,381
[SPEAKER_03]: How crystal clear it seems.

911
01:29:04,901 --> 01:29:09,144
[SPEAKER_03]: You must believe in spring.

912
01:29:11,627 --> 01:29:18,891
[SPEAKER_04]: You must believe in love and trust it's on its way.

913
01:29:20,693 --> 01:29:28,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Just as the sleeping rose awaits the kiss of May.

914
01:29:28,757 --> 01:29:36,502
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a world of woe, of things that come and go,

915
01:29:39,452 --> 01:29:49,538
[SPEAKER_03]: where what you think you know you can't be certain of.

916
01:29:50,479 --> 01:30:01,226
[SPEAKER_03]: You must believe in spring and love.

917
01:30:24,704 --> 01:30:25,964
[SPEAKER_03]: How much damage have I done?

918
01:30:27,425 --> 01:30:28,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I say my poem?

919
01:30:28,926 --> 01:30:30,027
[SPEAKER_03]: You want me to say my poem?

920
01:30:32,475 --> 01:30:37,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to compete, but this came on my heart, and I can't get enough of it.

921
01:30:38,618 --> 01:30:40,739
[SPEAKER_03]: This is called Peanuts and Poetry.

922
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm going to be finished when I finish this one.

923
01:30:45,581 --> 01:30:46,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll cry.

924
01:30:46,301 --> 01:30:46,962
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be crying.

925
01:30:52,744 --> 01:30:53,865
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

926
01:30:57,727 --> 01:31:00,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Knock down, drag out.

927
01:31:02,347 --> 01:31:06,791
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it really worth it, calling names we know so many of?

928
01:31:09,413 --> 01:31:14,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Freedom's baby, can we ever birth it?

929
01:31:15,558 --> 01:31:18,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Born of all this hatred, not of love?

930
01:31:21,422 --> 01:31:25,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Win the prize and the world denies you, never acknowledging what you've done.

931
01:31:28,331 --> 01:31:32,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Peanuts and poetry, how fast do we have to run?

932
01:31:35,418 --> 01:31:41,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Evers never thought we'd still be fighting when he gave his life along with King.

933
01:31:43,385 --> 01:31:51,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Waller's treasures all the world delighting, giving Bessie bluesy songs to sing.

934
01:31:53,214 --> 01:32:00,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Countless painters colored in the truth, light and dark, two worlds in a great divide.

935
01:32:01,878 --> 01:32:06,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Peanuts and poetry, excellence can't be denied.

936
01:32:07,701 --> 01:32:14,245
[SPEAKER_03]: So today, when anyone has to be formally known as anything but free,

937
01:32:16,249 --> 01:32:25,574
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all evidence of faith that stands in defense of the sanctified, redeemed, and everlasting peace.

938
01:32:28,856 --> 01:32:38,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Carver, Dunbar, Ellington, and Blakey, Johnson and Du Bois all paid the price.

939
01:32:40,082 --> 01:32:44,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Cullen, Douglas, Josephine all shaky,

940
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Unknown nannies full of free advice.

941
01:32:50,004 --> 01:32:56,249
[SPEAKER_03]: Lincoln looming looking down on Marion as she sang of rivers running deep.

942
01:32:58,632 --> 01:33:04,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Peanuts and poetry have saved us from a tortured sleep.

943
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:06,999
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

944
01:33:13,391 --> 01:33:13,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

945
01:33:14,093 --> 01:33:15,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Terry for having me.

946
01:33:20,907 --> 01:33:21,849
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

947
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:22,892
[SPEAKER_03]: God bless you.

948
01:33:37,577 --> 01:33:42,940
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that love you best will come when no one else will come.

949
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,383
[SPEAKER_01]: And Donna, thank you for coming.

950
01:33:49,823 --> 01:33:52,605
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how I feel, so I don't really have to say that.

951
01:33:53,465 --> 01:33:55,026
[SPEAKER_01]: But absolutely, absolutely.

952
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:55,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep smiling.

953
01:33:58,436 --> 01:33:59,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you can.

954
01:34:01,538 --> 01:34:04,139
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, thanks for coming out, everybody.

955
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:21,290
[SPEAKER_01]: We so appreciate having these evenings together because, you know, as we look around, you know, at that top part of the wall and the bottom part of the wall, so many of the folks that would love to be here are no longer with us and can't be here.

956
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:29,075
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just so thankful for the ones that are still with us and can come out and enjoy these evenings together.

957
01:34:29,436 --> 01:34:33,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank once again Kevin Harrington, Method Community Media.

958
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:44,026
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, he's, you know, and for us here at the Community Center, he's become another one of those friends that comes when you call him and

959
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:50,291
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't fuss with you or grouse, even though he's tired and he's still got a long way to go when he leaves here.

960
01:34:50,371 --> 01:34:51,973
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you.

961
01:34:51,993 --> 01:34:52,753
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I do.

962
01:34:53,554 --> 01:35:08,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to thank everybody from the Medford Arts Council and the Massachusetts Cultural Council for providing the grant that makes these evenings together available to us.

963
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:23,806
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our community home, and we just keep trying to do things that keep us all engaged and keep the joy, as you so eloquently put it, that keep the joy with us.

964
01:35:25,027 --> 01:35:27,590
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got a bunch of announcements.

965
01:35:29,112 --> 01:35:30,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the bulletin board.

966
01:35:31,294 --> 01:35:34,197
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of stuff going on at the community center.

967
01:35:34,417 --> 01:35:37,821
[SPEAKER_01]: The pumpkin smash is happening tomorrow, right?

968
01:35:37,921 --> 01:35:39,342
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to bring...

969
01:35:40,223 --> 01:35:48,751
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got pumpkins, okay, and you don't want to throw them in the trash, obviously, bring them to the pumpkin smash, because they'll get smashed.

970
01:35:49,791 --> 01:36:03,563
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll end up as compost, you know, and something that's good for the planet, as opposed to, you know, where this kind of stuff usually ends up, which is garbage and, you know, landfills and dung heaps, and we don't want any of that.

971
01:36:06,666 --> 01:36:07,667
[SPEAKER_01]: Lisa, what else?

972
01:36:12,658 --> 01:36:13,702
[SPEAKER_01]: I do, I do.

973
01:36:13,802 --> 01:36:17,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I'm just gonna tease this because there's gonna be more coming.

974
01:36:19,358 --> 01:36:27,721
[SPEAKER_01]: A few years back, we started to get the ball rolling toward a commemoration of the black veterans from the West Medford community.

975
01:36:28,841 --> 01:36:37,024
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, time and tide kind of made us veer away from that because we had other work to do and other things going on.

976
01:36:37,604 --> 01:36:40,806
[SPEAKER_01]: But we recently were awarded a $20,000 grant

977
01:36:46,528 --> 01:36:51,970
[SPEAKER_01]: by mass humanities to re-engage with that work.

978
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:53,850
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll be hearing more about it.

979
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:55,131
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to do.

980
01:36:56,171 --> 01:37:01,934
[SPEAKER_01]: But we finally have what we consider to be the right kind of resources in order to do it well.

981
01:37:02,794 --> 01:37:08,196
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll be getting some folks together and talking to a lot of folks.

982
01:37:09,176 --> 01:37:36,663
[SPEAKER_01]: pictures and memorabilia and artifacts and there'll be video and interviews and all kinds of things that will make this project come together so that we can visually represent some of the heroes from the West Medford community that were involved in World War II, the Korean conflict, probably tipping on into the Vietnam era so that we can tell a pretty full and thorough story.

983
01:37:37,804 --> 01:37:44,951
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many stories that this community has to tell, and we feel like if we don't tell them, who will?

984
01:37:45,492 --> 01:37:53,880
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why we're embarking on this project in a more ambitious and thorough way this time, and we're gonna get it done.

985
01:37:54,521 --> 01:37:56,062
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna get it done, okay?

986
01:37:57,864 --> 01:38:03,588
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep an eye out for that second pad of bricks that's coming.

987
01:38:04,048 --> 01:38:08,371
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all together the pad is going to hold 78.

988
01:38:10,692 --> 01:38:13,294
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a combination of 8x8 bricks and 4x8 bricks.

989
01:38:15,975 --> 01:38:17,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're fully subscribed.

990
01:38:17,656 --> 01:38:19,196
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have another space left.

991
01:38:19,256 --> 01:38:23,137
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm real proud of the fact that folks have come forward.

992
01:38:23,238 --> 01:38:36,161
[SPEAKER_01]: And really, they're folks from across the city, folks from really across the nation, because a lot of folks that have left Medford called in their brick orders so that their families could be commemorated.

993
01:38:36,261 --> 01:38:44,204
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be, just like the first pad, it's going to be a real nice commemoration of life in West Medford.

994
01:38:46,165 --> 01:38:46,926
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I got.

995
01:38:48,067 --> 01:38:48,447
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

996
01:38:48,668 --> 01:38:49,308
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that enough?

997
01:38:49,729 --> 01:38:50,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

998
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:51,070
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

999
01:38:51,831 --> 01:38:52,351
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes.

1000
01:38:52,912 --> 01:39:00,319
[SPEAKER_01]: So, November 25th, Saturday, November 25th, here from 12 to 4, the Black Vendors Fair.

1001
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:03,141
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be, you know, it'll be a great affair.

1002
01:39:03,782 --> 01:39:05,063
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'll really enjoy it.

1003
01:39:05,424 --> 01:39:08,827
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody who has come out to the ones that we've had in the past have really, really

1004
01:39:09,367 --> 01:39:10,828
[SPEAKER_01]: enjoyed and appreciated them.

1005
01:39:11,328 --> 01:39:16,510
[SPEAKER_01]: And listen, it's gift-giving season, so nobody goes to the mall anymore.

1006
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:21,132
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, everybody sits at the computer and types in, you know, a website.

1007
01:39:21,192 --> 01:39:32,656
[SPEAKER_01]: So come on out, see your neighbors, and there'll be some really, really unique and great gifts to be able to buy and enjoy either yourself or share with your family members.

1008
01:39:33,257 --> 01:39:35,718
[SPEAKER_01]: So we hope to see you at the Black Vendors.

1009
01:39:36,758 --> 01:39:41,639
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the next First Friday will be, I think it's December 1st, right?

1010
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:49,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless, you know, we decide to push it out an extra week, which is a possibility, just because December is such a busy month.

1011
01:39:50,201 --> 01:39:54,702
[SPEAKER_01]: In any case, we will be holding a First Friday next month.

1012
01:39:55,442 --> 01:39:56,823
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got work to do.

1013
01:39:59,263 --> 01:40:00,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, how we doing?

1014
01:40:01,644 --> 01:40:02,604
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good on time?

1015
01:40:04,515 --> 01:40:06,137
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a wrap.

1016
01:40:06,438 --> 01:40:10,262
[SPEAKER_01]: So join us in December for another First Friday.

1017
01:40:10,643 --> 01:40:13,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to Lisa for making my job easy.

1018
01:40:13,646 --> 01:40:16,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks to you all for coming out once again.

1019
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:17,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a great night.

1020
01:40:17,591 --> 01:40:18,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Be safe out there.

1021
01:40:19,253 --> 01:40:20,835
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see you again soon.

1022
01:40:34,119 --> 01:40:34,319
Bye.
