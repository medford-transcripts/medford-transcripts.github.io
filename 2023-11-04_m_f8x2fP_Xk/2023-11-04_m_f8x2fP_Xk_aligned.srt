1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:02,510
our students in the Medford Public Schools.

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:04,311
Welcome to the show, Mare.

3
00:00:04,331 --> 00:00:05,792
Thank you, thank you for having me, Terry.

4
00:00:05,812 --> 00:00:06,653
You are welcome.

5
00:00:07,793 --> 00:00:18,319
So as we're seeing so much hostility and pain in the world right now, I'm currently writing from a place of some anxiety and deep reflection.

6
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:25,903
So as is my custom in hosting these evenings, I like to share a piece of verse that is hopeful.

7
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:27,344
Thank you.

8
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:29,485
And it's called Maybe.

9
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:35,997
Maybe if we could all cry together, we could make it all right.

10
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:44,763
We could wash each other in familiar tears, bathing away the dirt of a filthy world with something like a warm spring rain.

11
00:00:45,908 --> 00:00:55,481
Maybe if we could all grieve as one over the confusion and mayhem and death of a society gone more than a bit mad, we could get past the anger.

12
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:57,884
We could get out the anxiety.

13
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,346
We could get around fear.

14
00:00:59,386 --> 00:01:01,929
We could get to real conversation.

15
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:03,952
We could get on with forgiveness.

16
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:09,714
Maybe if we could put down our weapons, we could recover the peaceful kingdom.

17
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,397
We could rekindle lost relationships.

18
00:01:12,457 --> 00:01:14,799
We could embrace human diversity.

19
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,102
We could rediscover beloved community.

20
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:22,768
We could be equal sons, daughters, and heirs to a loving and liberating God.

21
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:35,216
Maybe if we could pick up our crosses and carry them toward the hills of salvation together, we could see each other's footprints in the sand and snow and unpaved byways.

22
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:37,417
We would know our neighbors.

23
00:01:37,857 --> 00:01:40,359
We would see the road unfold before us.

24
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:43,020
We would feel the same wind in our sails.

25
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,622
We would value the journey beyond the destination.

26
00:01:47,703 --> 00:01:50,706
Maybe if we could prize people over possessions.

27
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:52,988
Everyone could have enough to thrive.

28
00:01:53,529 --> 00:01:55,931
Everyone could flourish, not just survive.

29
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,473
Everyone could learn to really give.

30
00:01:59,013 --> 00:02:01,436
Everyone could value the life we live.

31
00:02:02,477 --> 00:02:04,619
No one would ever leave his brother behind.

32
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,041
Everyone could lift as we all try to climb.

33
00:02:08,303 --> 00:02:14,525
Maybe if we could all laugh together, we could hear the universal sound of joy.

34
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:17,666
We could revel in the gurgle of all the babies.

35
00:02:17,706 --> 00:02:26,669
We could immerse ourselves in the sweetness of each sparkling smile, the heartiness of each chortle, chuckle, guffaw, and belly laugh.

36
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:33,311
We would let our frozen guard down and warm to the thawing of a kindred humanity.

37
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:36,512
Maybe, just maybe.

38
00:02:38,576 --> 00:02:38,897
OK.

39
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:40,299
Thank you.

40
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:41,581
Thank you.

41
00:02:42,863 --> 00:02:45,587
So that's hopefully a good place to start.

42
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:49,593
Let's really welcome Mayor Brianna and have a friendly chat.

43
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:52,218
So thank you.

44
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:52,899
Very good.

45
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:53,540
Very good.

46
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,682
So you've been kind of busy lately.

47
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,983
You're doing the business of the city.

48
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:09,410
What are you doing to, as Whitney Gilbert used to say on her show, relax, relate, and release?

49
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:12,512
Very busy lately.

50
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:13,713
Absolutely.

51
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:29,347
Yes, we're running the city, the campaign on top of that, and then I have three very, very happy and healthy but busy children, and I kick it over nine traveling sports teams this fall, so.

52
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:36,588
My husband and I, it's like we're strangers in the wind, but we make it work and get it together.

53
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:37,808
It's keeping us all out of trouble.

54
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:44,753
So yeah, trying to make sure that our city's operating, and then I'm also the chair of the school committee.

55
00:03:45,374 --> 00:03:46,474
So yeah, it's been busy, but good.

56
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:50,597
And we only have four days left for the campaign, and hopefully be able to put that behind us.

57
00:03:51,118 --> 00:03:53,399
And you'll see every candidate is tired.

58
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,020
It's just a lot to be able to do the work.

59
00:03:56,902 --> 00:04:07,951
be out there, although I always love going to the events and things like that, but adding, you know, the canvassing and the sign holding and filling out surveys and it's just, it's a lot.

60
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:08,852
It's been busy.

61
00:04:09,112 --> 00:04:10,493
No doubt about it, no doubt about it.

62
00:04:10,513 --> 00:04:11,774
But all good, all good.

63
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:12,795
All right, all right.

64
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:16,338
Do they give you a moment or two to relax from time to time?

65
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:19,026
Yeah, I try to get out for a run once a week.

66
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:19,746
OK.

67
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:25,631
Try to watch maybe one TV show a week just to clear the mind.

68
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:26,472
OK.

69
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:27,292
Yeah.

70
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:27,913
OK.

71
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:28,714
Very good.

72
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:29,334
Very good.

73
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:35,639
How did you meet and eventually marry your husband, David?

74
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:36,740
Oh, good question.

75
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:43,619
My friend, who's still my good friend, she was over for Halloween.

76
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:59,125
We've been friends since kindergarten, and she was dating somebody from Long Island to New York, and said, I think my boyfriend's friend, you'd really get along with him.

77
00:04:59,145 --> 00:04:59,926
You should come meet him.

78
00:04:59,946 --> 00:05:03,287
And that happened for about three, four, five, six months.

79
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:05,428
Finally, I said, OK, I'll go and meet him.

80
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:12,572
And then we went up to, at the time they were living in Connecticut, and we hit it off the first night, and we've been together ever since.

81
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,193
So she knows you a little bit.

82
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,073
A little bit.

83
00:05:15,853 --> 00:05:20,676
Every anniversary for my husband and I, she sends me a, you're welcome, text.

84
00:05:21,076 --> 00:05:21,637
You're welcome.

85
00:05:22,457 --> 00:05:24,838
Not happy anniversary, but you're welcome.

86
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:27,660
Like, thanks for the 20th time.

87
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,461
So how many years in are you?

88
00:05:30,808 --> 00:05:37,731
We've been together 20 plus years and we've been married 15 and a half years.

89
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:38,451
Congratulations.

90
00:05:38,491 --> 00:05:38,871
Thank you.

91
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:39,531
Very good.

92
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:40,812
Very good.

93
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:44,553
How is your hubby feeling about you running for a third term?

94
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:48,938
He's always very supportive.

95
00:05:49,618 --> 00:05:54,862
I tell the story that he is a physical therapist, and he's local now.

96
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:57,683
He's Medford, Arlington, and Winchester.

97
00:05:57,723 --> 00:06:01,346
But before he opened his own practice,

98
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:04,807
he was down in the Walpole-Sharon area.

99
00:06:05,467 --> 00:06:20,771
So from 6 in the morning until 8 at night, 9 at night and then also on Saturdays he was working and I was practicing law, taking care of the babies and that was 10-12 years so finally when we were deciding

100
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:25,816
if I should run for mayor, was it the right decision for the family?

101
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:34,427
And we decided that, yes, we want to do it because we have kids in the schools and we do want the best for our community.

102
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:37,471
He said, it's your turn.

103
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:49,262
Okay, so he's extremely supportive, you know, he does a lot of the athletics especially on nights that I have meetings And yeah, yeah, I think it's a little overwhelming.

104
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:57,329
It's tough for him the social media a part of it and the negativity Yeah gets to him a bit especially just like around now and it really heats up.

105
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:58,530
We've been lucky.

106
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,575
It's been a very good campaign season, you know, I think counselor Carviel and I really trying to run a a

107
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:04,956
as much as we can.

108
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:16,501
I know it's going to get tough today, but otherwise it's been a pretty calm, not too much negativity, which is great.

109
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:19,502
But when it turns up, yeah, that gets to my husband a bit.

110
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:33,273
yeah which which is understandable understandable but you know as you say and to his credit you know Rick is a pretty honorable guy so you know he didn't like to get down in the weeds in the mud that's not really his style

111
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:42,486
Okay, so I think we probably have answered some of this question with what you just said.

112
00:07:42,506 --> 00:07:47,030
I was going to ask you a little bit about the division of labor in the household.

113
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:51,795
But as you said, David is doing his thing right now.

114
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:53,957
He's getting the kids where they need to be.

115
00:07:54,537 --> 00:08:00,686
Yeah, and I do too, you know, one weekend I'll have a couple, an hour and I'll do the food shopping, the next weekend he'll do it.

116
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:07,497
And my kids, we taught them how to turn on and put in soap to the laundry machine, you know, they have to do their own dishes.

117
00:08:07,537 --> 00:08:10,060
We have chores in the house, so we really try to

118
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:13,804
That's all they've known me in politics, whether it was counselor or mayor.

119
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:19,688
So I try to teach them the good of the job and the good that you can do in the community.

120
00:08:19,768 --> 00:08:23,832
And I think they understand it and want to pitch in some.

121
00:08:23,912 --> 00:08:25,873
So we make it work.

122
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:31,438
Has any one of them expressed any kind of an interest in what you do?

123
00:08:33,753 --> 00:08:36,716
My son is affected by the goods.

124
00:08:36,756 --> 00:08:42,401
So if we do a community-wide cleanup, he'll clean up an area and then he'll never forget it.

125
00:08:42,461 --> 00:08:44,203
And he has to tell me every time.

126
00:08:44,383 --> 00:08:47,286
Or we put flags on the graves for Memorial Day.

127
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:53,111
And every time we drive by Oak Grove, he's like, that's where we go in May, and we put flags on the graves.

128
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:56,274
but I think they're all impacted.

129
00:08:56,314 --> 00:09:04,860
My other two are older teenage daughters, so they watch the debate and they're learning and understanding.

130
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,842
Do they want to talk about politics much?

131
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:20,232
No, no, but there'll be times that I just make sure I tell them a story about something that I think will affect them in the future, whether that has to do with working hard or holding somebody accountable or recently,

132
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:26,215
that we'd got the verdict for the bribery case in Medford.

133
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:36,020
So I like you try to explain that to them so they know what integrity is and what that scheme was about and do my best to not not infiltrate them with it.

134
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,202
But once in a once in a while, tell them a story that I know will impact them in the future.

135
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:42,263
OK, OK.

136
00:09:43,184 --> 00:09:44,404
So you're two terms in.

137
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:49,467
How different has it been in the second term than it was in the first?

138
00:09:52,276 --> 00:09:52,416
Yep.

139
00:09:52,837 --> 00:09:54,017
Three and three and a half years.

140
00:09:54,037 --> 00:09:59,181
I think the first term we about eight weeks in, we got hit with covid.

141
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:11,431
So a lot of that a lot of the first term was getting through covid, making sure everybody was healthy and safe and then getting the city back up and running while we were doing the planning.

142
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:16,535
You know, we're doing the housing production plan and the climate action and adaptation plan.

143
00:10:17,113 --> 00:10:21,177
and our comprehensive master plan and our street and sidewalk assessment.

144
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:26,063
And so we were really people didn't see us out much, but we were in City Hall.

145
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:30,448
The whole City Hall was always open unless the governor shut it down.

146
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:35,994
We were grinding and doing the work and trying to have the community meetings, even if they were on Zoom.

147
00:10:36,474 --> 00:10:37,735
and getting that planning done.

148
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:47,364
So now it's exciting to see more and more projects breaking ground and ribbon cuttings, because that's the work we did the first two years.

149
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:54,711
We have the largest park project where just broke ground on, which is Car Park, and then Gillis is halfway through.

150
00:10:55,451 --> 00:11:03,457
because that needed some accessibility improvements, and it's going to be a great park for people of all ages and abilities.

151
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:07,080
But then you see the Great American Bear Hall.

152
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,381
I went to go visit the site yesterday.

153
00:11:09,441 --> 00:11:11,903
That's broken ground, and that's going to be done in June.

154
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:15,846
That's going to have 90 bears on tap and all kinds of food and games.

155
00:11:16,486 --> 00:11:22,030
That went wild on social media yesterday, so people are seeing all the projects.

156
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,613
We're finally able to see the work getting done.

157
00:11:25,653 --> 00:11:32,818
We did two miles of, I know we have a lot more miles due, but two miles of sidewalk repairs just this year.

158
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:45,387
We've removed half of our tree stumps, which was just, it took two years to, we've been removing them every year, but we finally got to a point where we found the funding, we're applying for grants, we're receiving the grants,

159
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:58,536
moving forward on a municipal vulnerability preparedness work through our liaisons and connectors, and you're seeing the different events pop up that, you know, it takes time to plan.

160
00:11:58,556 --> 00:11:59,017
Understood.

161
00:11:59,057 --> 00:12:01,999
So we have a lot going on, which is just the positive.

162
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,401
The positive is so positive, and that's why I love the job.

163
00:12:04,761 --> 00:12:06,042
You know, it outweighs the negatives.

164
00:12:06,322 --> 00:12:07,043
OK, OK.

165
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:11,351
So talk to me a little bit about your current team.

166
00:12:11,371 --> 00:12:14,196
There's always a lot of change taking place at City Hall.

167
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:17,222
What do you have for players right now?

168
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:29,071
We have I merged early on in the term, merged the Office of Community Development with Energy and Environment.

169
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:35,115
So we have our Planning, Development and Sustainability Department, which is run by Director Hunt.

170
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:38,718
And then we have our Diversity, Equity, Inclusion

171
00:12:39,598 --> 00:12:44,242
director who's been at it for quite some time now with us, Francis Wojtyla.

172
00:12:44,302 --> 00:12:55,051
We have a good strong Department of Public Works and engineering team with Director Blake, Director Wartell and McGivern.

173
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:59,695
We finally had a place with our parking department with Faye Morrison where

174
00:13:01,116 --> 00:13:05,759
And our special projects manager, Jim Silva, that's helping with any parking issues we see that pop up.

175
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:13,024
And people finally are getting, follow the rules of the road, and we're making progress there.

176
00:13:13,484 --> 00:13:14,525
And then the list goes on.

177
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,526
We have a really strong finance team.

178
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:29,074
We have procurement, treasure collector, CFO, budget director, that are all, we had a budget, we won a budget award two years ago, applied again.

179
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:37,039
Yeah, I mean, I feel like we have a strong team, good chiefs in place, and yeah.

180
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:39,461
I'm sure I'm missing people, so I could keep going, but.

181
00:13:39,501 --> 00:13:54,990
Well, the reason why I ask, and it's good to hear you point out so many different folks, is because I think sometimes people have the impression that all of this stuff happens specifically in one place.

182
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:14,646
And you know kind of name and all the different teams and all the different collaborations and services and everything It's really really quite an intricate web of service delivery that's taking place in the city Oh, yeah, and I think it's important for folks to see and know that yep our recreation department with our senior center and library you know those directors are great and them and

183
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:22,129
Plan it our Board of Health with our Office of Prevention and Outreach, you know Nobody's ever perfect.

184
00:14:22,149 --> 00:14:38,616
We have a lot more we have to do but we You know, we're able to really work together doing a new we're almost done with our emergency management plan For the city, so we'll be prepared if there's a flood or if there's an environmental disaster We'll get in the Andrews ready

185
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:42,800
I know this location is also a good one, too, in the Hegner Center.

186
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:53,833
So we're trying to map out where people can go to get what they need, water, food, services, and hopefully never need for housing, but emergency housing.

187
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:55,675
But yeah, we're doing a lot of work.

188
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:57,546
Very good, very good.

189
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:05,692
What's surprising you right now about the goings on at City Hall, the work that you're doing?

190
00:15:06,452 --> 00:15:10,395
What makes you kind of go, woo, if anything?

191
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:24,174
My day is filled with the, or half of my day, I guess, is filled with some of the HR pieces, which can be, whew, in themselves.

192
00:15:25,094 --> 00:15:30,716
But I always say that I drive home and then I think of all the good that people are doing.

193
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:34,917
So not even just in City Hall, just throughout the community.

194
00:15:35,037 --> 00:15:41,839
All the boards and commission volunteers and people that are just working together, all the organizations we have in Medford, so really,

195
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:55,209
blows my mind at how hard so many, not everybody, but so many people worked and and how many people just really work for the city that care about its future and care about the people of Medford and making sure that we do.

196
00:15:55,349 --> 00:16:01,393
Everybody does have what they need and everybody feels welcome and included in that process.

197
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:05,216
So it's it's a large task, but we're working hard at it.

198
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:05,796
OK, OK.

199
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,745
You spoke a little bit about it when you were talking about your first term versus your second.

200
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:25,861
I wanted to ask you, how has dealing with all you had to deal with going through the height of the COVID period, how has it changed the way that you approach governing the city?

201
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:43,124
I think the one of the biggest things COVID did for me personally in my governance is helped not help stay prepared and ready and

202
00:16:44,105 --> 00:17:04,084
have the for anything that comes our way so every day there's you know every week at least there's a crisis or two and just for me to stay calm cool and collected and you know even my communications director says how do you stay so calm like well I have to and

203
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,749
I have to, so then my team does, and my team can stretch very far.

204
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:18,400
But also because we have to be thoughtful, even if we have to act quickly, we still need to be thoughtful and think things through and work together.

205
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:25,628
So staying calm is something that COVID taught me, because my first eight weeks I would go to bed at night going, I don't know if I can do this.

206
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:31,972
Oh, the ABC is going to help the MBTA with the MAPC and the funding will come from the MT.

207
00:17:32,853 --> 00:17:35,855
It was just words that, you know, letter salad.

208
00:17:35,895 --> 00:17:41,359
But then Covid hit and just kind of had to slap myself across the face and say, it's time to lead.

209
00:17:41,379 --> 00:17:41,859
Yeah.

210
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,120
You know, you can do this.

211
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:43,680
And

212
00:17:44,941 --> 00:18:03,292
Yeah, knowing that I could make the right decisions, not that everybody would be happy one way or another, but that I really thought things through and I took my time and when I had to, to do what I thought was the best and listen to both sides so I could figure out what was needed to be done to keep people healthy and safe is definitely

213
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:10,978
helped me know how to manage stress, how to stay mentally ready.

214
00:18:10,998 --> 00:18:15,161
So that's probably my best answer I have.

215
00:18:15,201 --> 00:18:16,642
It's good, it's good, it's good.

216
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:19,484
What made you decide to run for another term?

217
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:30,539
I have so we have so many things on our plate that are that are unfinished and so much more good to do.

218
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,662
And I cannot could never leave the team that I have in place now.

219
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:48,130
And we have from hopefully getting an MSBA loan to redo our flagship school, which is our high school, to carrying out continuing to carry out all these plans.

220
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,592
and keep the team in place that we have.

221
00:18:53,213 --> 00:18:58,857
I go to bed at night knowing the work was hard, but that I am doing the right thing.

222
00:18:59,578 --> 00:19:03,060
So I just wanna continue to lead this great community.

223
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,602
Okay, okay, fair enough, fair enough.

224
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:15,569
So I know that this is always subject to change, because the ground shifts under our feet all the time, but kind of what,

225
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,540
What's your vision?

226
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,924
What's your current vision as the sitting mayor?

227
00:19:21,944 --> 00:19:31,573
And what's your big hope for the progress or development or whatever it is in the city of Medford?

228
00:19:31,593 --> 00:19:32,494
What are you hoping for?

229
00:19:34,634 --> 00:19:36,215
It's a long list.

230
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:38,677
I know, I know.

231
00:19:39,718 --> 00:19:41,260
Well, I think I touched on it a little bit.

232
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:54,132
I think we need to continue making progress to make sure that everybody feels connected and included and welcome in this community.

233
00:19:54,152 --> 00:19:55,273
I think we want

234
00:19:55,714 --> 00:20:01,981
to make sure we're transparent in the process and that we get input and ideas from everybody.

235
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:06,847
And that goes with the liaisons and the connectors we have.

236
00:20:06,887 --> 00:20:12,893
They all speak multiple languages, or at least a second language, and they're out in our community building trust.

237
00:20:15,636 --> 00:20:24,406
So, I mean, that's like my overall vision, but you want to make sure people have what they need as far as we need to create more affordable housing.

238
00:20:24,426 --> 00:20:29,412
We have 500 units or so in production now, and we need to do our part.

239
00:20:30,533 --> 00:20:32,656
in the future, and then just basic needs.

240
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:44,153
Transportation, you'll always see me out front leading and advocating for the residents of Medford to make sure that we have safe and reliable transportation, to food insecurity.

241
00:20:47,366 --> 00:20:49,868
Yeah, the list goes on, but development's big.

242
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:59,233
It's money that runs the city, so we're trying to boost economic growth and new growth numbers.

243
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:09,178
We want those to be high so that we have money to spend on our schools and our library, on our parks and playgrounds and streets, and give our employees the raises they need.

244
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:15,935
It's a lot of components, but I just want to continue to make progress in a positive way.

245
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:18,825
Excellent, excellent.

246
00:21:19,065 --> 00:21:33,236
So one of my favorite new things in Medford, a lot of folks haven't had the opportunity to experience it as yet, and it still hasn't officially opened, but I managed to sneak in a tour about a week ago.

247
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:36,479
It's the new Arts Center on Mystic Avenue.

248
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,640
It's a great space.

249
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,921
Can you talk about it a little bit?

250
00:21:40,021 --> 00:21:41,082
Sure, sure, yeah.

251
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:42,684
We are helping them right now.

252
00:21:42,704 --> 00:21:43,884
We just signed the...

253
00:21:44,645 --> 00:21:47,880
what they needed with MassDOT, because they're doing some improvements on our roads.

254
00:21:49,252 --> 00:21:54,774
just months away from opening, so that'll be Theory Wellness and a beautiful new art center.

255
00:21:56,115 --> 00:22:08,059
I did, too, take a tour, and it's gonna be a great space for local artists to be able to display art and do their work inside a building that everybody can enjoy.

256
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:14,421
So we're so lucky to be able to hopefully open that in the next several months, and that's right on Mystic Ave.

257
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:15,462
It's gonna be amazing.

258
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:28,614
Yeah, so for those of you that haven't had an opportunity, you're going down Mystic Ave, right past, I think it's the, I hate to say it like this, the liquor store, is it?

259
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:29,495
Atlas.

260
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:31,156
Atlas, Atlas liquor store.

261
00:22:32,258 --> 00:22:37,863
There's a huge building, part of the building is a cannabis.

262
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:39,024
Retail.

263
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:52,429
retail called Dairy Wellness, and the front side actually, based on agreements that were negotiated by the mayor's administration, is a new art center.

264
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:56,250
Beautiful, beautiful building.

265
00:22:56,631 --> 00:22:58,031
It'll have artists' suites.

266
00:22:58,571 --> 00:23:05,354
It'll have a floor somewhat similar to this one for exhibitions, displays.

267
00:23:06,254 --> 00:23:07,635
performances, et cetera.

268
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:22,179
And there's several entities that are kind of, you know, joining together, collaborating as kind of the governing bodies, including the Medford Arts Council and Arts Medford and Cache.

269
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:36,131
So it's gonna be a very collaborative space, and I think it really, really is a plum for the city, because it's been in discussion, some type of an art space like this, for years.

270
00:23:36,531 --> 00:23:37,072
For years, yes.

271
00:23:37,112 --> 00:23:38,132
For a long time.

272
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:39,053
Exciting.

273
00:23:39,394 --> 00:23:46,660
So, related to that, how do you see the arts enhancing life in the city, and what more would you like to see?

274
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:51,072
I think we can always enhance the arts.

275
00:23:51,112 --> 00:23:53,835
You were our first Poet Laureate.

276
00:23:54,096 --> 00:23:57,220
We've done, and that was just amazing.

277
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,823
Now we're our second one in.

278
00:24:00,223 --> 00:24:02,166
Vijaya is amazing as well.

279
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:03,447
So she has a two-year term.

280
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:04,809
We already know who the next...

281
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:08,390
next will be because we have so many wonderful poets in Medford.

282
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:11,771
And I'm always working on a project, an arts mural.

283
00:24:11,931 --> 00:24:13,351
I like to take that on myself.

284
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:15,772
So we've done one at Tufts Pool.

285
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:17,572
We've done it one at Wrights Pond.

286
00:24:17,632 --> 00:24:22,153
And I want to, you know, I love the art that's popping up.

287
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:25,594
Like Colleen's has Amelia Earhart on the wall.

288
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:27,535
We have our

289
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:35,525
I know West Memphis Community Center has arts fairs, so we want to keep seeing those popping up.

290
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:41,072
We have our holiday extravaganza where we'll have 40 art vendors.

291
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:45,037
So bringing the arts into everything we do is probably our goal.

292
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:55,901
And we love new ideas and we'll continue to push, support Arts Medford and the grants they give out and work with them on different things.

293
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:58,341
We love that part of the job.

294
00:24:59,362 --> 00:25:00,862
It's a great part of the job, yeah.

295
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:09,624
So you can have season tickets to the Bruins, the Red Sox, the Celtics, the Patriots or the New England Revolution.

296
00:25:09,684 --> 00:25:11,465
Who do you wanna go see and why?

297
00:25:14,332 --> 00:25:15,052
I was a baller.

298
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:19,835
I played basketball in high school and went into college playing basketball.

299
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:26,638
So I would usually pick the Celtics, and that's kind of probably the most games I went to when I was young.

300
00:25:28,792 --> 00:25:34,057
But with two kids that play hockey, I may have to go Bruins.

301
00:25:34,557 --> 00:25:41,804
And maybe because I went to the game last night, my son's Medford Peewees, they skated a whole game at 4 o'clock.

302
00:25:42,705 --> 00:25:44,947
And they got to do it at TD Garden.

303
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:50,492
And then my son's age, which is about nine, there was about 25 of them on the ice for the three minutes of fame.

304
00:25:50,812 --> 00:25:52,494
It was the fastest three minutes that I've ever seen.

305
00:25:52,734 --> 00:25:53,955
seen on the ice.

306
00:25:53,995 --> 00:26:03,104
They got on the ice, they got off the ice, but it was after the first period and the crowd was going crazy and then the game was tied, went into overtime, went into shootout.

307
00:26:03,124 --> 00:26:04,666
It was pretty exciting.

308
00:26:04,706 --> 00:26:06,488
So that's on my brain right now.

309
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:07,569
So just going with the Bruins.

310
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:08,429
How about you?

311
00:26:10,071 --> 00:26:11,613
You know, it's funny.

312
00:26:11,853 --> 00:26:15,517
I'm a basketball kid too.

313
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:20,402
I played one year at Medford High on the freshman team.

314
00:26:22,985 --> 00:26:24,166
My brother was really good.

315
00:26:24,267 --> 00:26:25,808
My older brother was really good.

316
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:29,532
He played for the varsity and played a little bit in college.

317
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:35,888
I really like baseball.

318
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:41,878
I'm kind of a baseball historian with the Negro Leagues and everything.

319
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:44,402
So I like the Red Sox.

320
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:58,948
But I think right now, I'd probably go with you to the Celtics game, because their team looks really, really tasty this year.

321
00:26:58,968 --> 00:27:00,929
It's going to be a good season.

322
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:02,590
Yeah, it's going to be a good season.

323
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,031
It's going to be a good season.

324
00:27:05,572 --> 00:27:08,554
Three words your husband David would use to describe you.

325
00:27:11,598 --> 00:27:13,559
Good ones or bad ones?

326
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,280
Whichever ones you feel comfortable talking about.

327
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:23,404
Hardworking, caring, stubborn.

328
00:27:28,487 --> 00:27:29,728
Why would he call you stubborn?

329
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:32,609
I mean, I'm pretty set in my ways.

330
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,210
You want what you want.

331
00:27:35,971 --> 00:27:36,191
Yeah.

332
00:27:36,568 --> 00:27:46,282
okay okay all right three words you would use to describe David oh geez amazing father

333
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,651
nonstop go-getter.

334
00:27:54,251 --> 00:27:56,252
And he's also a very, very hard worker.

335
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:58,333
Okay, okay.

336
00:27:58,373 --> 00:27:58,853
Good.

337
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:03,775
Sounds like you guys, well, you know, in 15 years, it's pretty well-matched.

338
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,455
Pretty well-matched, okay.

339
00:28:06,896 --> 00:28:13,818
So what new things are you excited about working on in a potential new term as mayor?

340
00:28:14,938 --> 00:28:15,499
New things.

341
00:28:21,744 --> 00:28:22,570
A lot of new things.

342
00:28:28,303 --> 00:28:46,186
I think furthering the work with our diversity equity inclusion director at our Office of Prevention and Outreach with our liaisons and connectors and expanding how we communicate with all of our residents.

343
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:55,828
So I see that being, you know, we're we're doing we're applying for another municipal vulnerability preparedness grant and a bar foundation grant.

344
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:56,068
So

345
00:28:56,688 --> 00:29:01,070
getting more funds to be able to continue that work and get more things translated.

346
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:06,832
And we're working with hopefully going to sign a contract with an ASL interpreter.

347
00:29:06,852 --> 00:29:18,115
Yeah, just furthering that welcoming, inclusive feeling for everybody, because I think that is a missing piece, especially for those that don't speak English.

348
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:22,477
We need to make sure that we're reaching every part of our community.

349
00:29:22,497 --> 00:29:24,337
OK, so that's that's one thing.

350
00:29:24,377 --> 00:29:25,138
But very good.

351
00:29:28,379 --> 00:29:32,043
Don't want to really speak it into the universe, but I feel like I need to ask.

352
00:29:33,024 --> 00:29:39,712
If you were to leave the mayor's office, what would you do and what would you miss?

353
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:42,235
Yeah.

354
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:44,632
Thought through that.

355
00:29:44,712 --> 00:29:47,995
I don't know what my next step is.

356
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:49,736
People always ask, what are you going to do next?

357
00:29:49,776 --> 00:29:50,677
Where are you going to go?

358
00:29:50,917 --> 00:29:51,358
I don't know.

359
00:29:51,418 --> 00:29:54,321
I try to live in the moment and take one thing at a time.

360
00:29:55,281 --> 00:29:59,185
But I would always potentially have teaching on that list.

361
00:29:59,525 --> 00:29:59,786
OK.

362
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:00,446
OK.

363
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:05,971
Take six months off and be with my kids, maybe.

364
00:30:06,872 --> 00:30:09,054
Relax a minute, probably be on my list.

365
00:30:11,124 --> 00:30:12,246
And what was the second part of the question?

366
00:30:13,308 --> 00:30:14,229
What would you miss?

367
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:16,433
I would miss the people.

368
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:17,234
OK.

369
00:30:17,394 --> 00:30:18,757
And that includes everybody.

370
00:30:18,797 --> 00:30:22,964
That includes people I work with, residents that I talk to.

371
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:30,294
I don't know how I would not be able to be as busy as I am now.

372
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:38,979
So I would miss the everyday trying to solve problems, trying to help people, because that's why I do the job.

373
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:39,559
OK.

374
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:40,220
OK.

375
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,340
Very good.

376
00:30:44,827 --> 00:30:46,429
Okay, here's something.

377
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:59,883
What would people who are kind of meeting you for the first time or encountering either Breonna the person or Breonna the mayor, what would they be surprised to learn about you?

378
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:12,259
Well, that's a secret.

379
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:12,499
No.

380
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:17,660
OK.

381
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,621
I don't know.

382
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:21,641
I I'm pretty I'm a pretty open book.

383
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:24,822
I people are always surprised that I am the mayor when I walk.

384
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:31,163
You know, they don't recognize me, especially if I have a hat on or I'm yet.

385
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:31,963
Yeah.

386
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:33,704
Just have my my hair up.

387
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:38,725
And they they're surprised at my age, you know, leading a city of 60000 people.

388
00:31:40,305 --> 00:31:42,166
and trying to do it as best I can.

389
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:46,428
Let me think that through.

390
00:31:46,548 --> 00:31:54,232
Okay, we can always come back to it or have you come back another time, no problem.

391
00:31:54,852 --> 00:32:05,677
So what continues to surprise you about the new people and families and residents as you go about doing all the different things that you're doing in the city?

392
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:07,838
What surprises you about Medford Folk?

393
00:32:09,114 --> 00:32:13,480
Amid for folks are then they have been.

394
00:32:14,984 --> 00:32:20,105
They've been more engaged than I've ever seen it before, which is great.

395
00:32:21,065 --> 00:32:22,986
You have a lot of young families moving in.

396
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:29,547
You have a lot of people getting involved and wanting to be active in the community.

397
00:32:29,587 --> 00:32:40,669
I am trying to diversify boards, but also bring in people that have never served on boards and commissions before you see so many people applying to just be part of the community.

398
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,290
So seeing how engaged people are.

399
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:47,953
and how willing people are to help make the change that needs to be made.

400
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:53,356
It's a good thing for the city to have folks from everywhere involved.

401
00:32:54,697 --> 00:33:00,661
As I look across the spectrum of things that are going on in the city,

402
00:33:01,502 --> 00:33:17,281
that's probably the greatest hope that I have, is that people can feel, people who have traditionally been disconnected, for whatever reason, can start to feel more connected to all of the different things that are happening in the life of the city.

403
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:25,269
Because there's really a lot here for folks if they just take advantage of it.

404
00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:32,836
I mean, I fuss with my constituents all the time about kind of staying engaged and staying involved.

405
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:34,918
I got to beat them to get them out the door.

406
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:35,259
But yeah, so.

407
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,105
It's a little bit of a serious question.

408
00:33:44,186 --> 00:34:02,320
What types of conversations have the events in Lewiston, Maine in particular, what kind of conversations are you beginning to have or have you had with law enforcement and public health related to the safety in the city?

409
00:34:06,061 --> 00:34:09,365
Yeah, like I mentioned earlier, we have been working.

410
00:34:09,425 --> 00:34:17,895
It's been about a year now working with the MAPC Metropolitan Action Planning Council on an emergency management plan.

411
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:23,361
So just two weeks ago, we had almost every director, including

412
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:31,927
representatives from Armstrong Ambulance and Tufts University in a room, and we were going through a scenario, a what-if scenario.

413
00:34:32,287 --> 00:34:33,187
And we went through it.

414
00:34:33,308 --> 00:34:45,576
It was two hours long, and we had to answer questions and be ready to, each table had to roundtable what their department would be doing if X or Y were to happen.

415
00:34:45,676 --> 00:34:47,957
So that plan is huge.

416
00:34:48,478 --> 00:34:53,441
We also are working on the security within the school system.

417
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:56,142
Okay, that's good to ask, yeah.

418
00:34:56,383 --> 00:34:58,624
Active shooter planning, potentially?

419
00:34:59,044 --> 00:35:19,816
They have drills that they do, but me, I'm trying to oversee, from my seat in the mayor's office, making sure if we need security upgrades, right now we're working on, don't get into the details, but we're working on making sure everything is working and we have protocols in place.

420
00:35:21,276 --> 00:35:24,438
for who can and cannot enter the buildings, things like that.

421
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:28,700
Yeah, it's what happened in Maine is, I just was watching the news before I got here.

422
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,601
It's devastating.

423
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:31,181
Yeah, it is.

424
00:35:31,401 --> 00:35:32,201
It absolutely is.

425
00:35:32,241 --> 00:35:41,205
And you know, I mean, it's a question that I really wasn't gonna ask, but right now it seems really important.

426
00:35:41,225 --> 00:35:42,866
I think it would have been derelict of me not to.

427
00:35:43,506 --> 00:35:44,046
to ask.

428
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:48,968
Yeah, it's been going on around the country in all different places.

429
00:35:49,048 --> 00:35:52,049
It's just Maine has hit real close to home.

430
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:52,570
Yeah.

431
00:35:52,910 --> 00:36:03,754
Well, it's good to know that you're having the conversations and that the city is not kind of taking a backseat to any other city and talking about it seriously.

432
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:04,554
OK.

433
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:13,045
Any questions you want to ask me or anything you want to ask about the community center that I might be able to answer?

434
00:36:17,253 --> 00:36:41,450
two questions I guess okay what is your favorite what's a your favorite poem you've ever written and and and how did you get into writing poetry okay so see I'm it's it's for me it's easy because I only have one child right so it's not like choosing between my children you know which one I like best I you know I don't know if I have a favorite

435
00:36:43,027 --> 00:36:43,567
poem.

436
00:36:43,587 --> 00:36:47,790
There's a lot of them that I really, really like.

437
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:50,511
I like to write about West Medford.

438
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:53,773
It's given me a lot of inspiration.

439
00:36:54,374 --> 00:37:03,099
And I think probably the poem that has the greatest notoriety is the piece that I wrote called Hired by the Mystic.

440
00:37:03,659 --> 00:37:13,166
that talks about the growth and development of the early West Memphis community, because that's the piece that got me muralized down on Mystic Ave.

441
00:37:13,186 --> 00:37:14,907
Congratulations, yeah, that's beautiful.

442
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:25,554
I mean, I can't not love that, because I think it kind of speaks to what this community is and what it continues to evolve into.

443
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:29,657
So that would probably be my favorite poem.

444
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:33,679
I've heard that one, yeah, great, love it.

445
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:37,020
You know, I mean, or the one that people seem to know the best.

446
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:57,626
In terms of how I got into writing the poetry, Medford really gets credit for this, because I was in high school, I was 16-ish maybe, and had an English teacher, nice Greek lady, her name was Eleanor Koukouvatis, and she gave me a small volume of Langston Hughes's poetry.

447
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:02,608
And up until that point, I didn't know that black people wrote poetry.

448
00:38:02,968 --> 00:38:03,708
I knew about one.

449
00:38:03,768 --> 00:38:05,229
I knew about Phyllis Wheatley.

450
00:38:06,069 --> 00:38:12,391
But I didn't know that there was this whole panorama of African-American literature.

451
00:38:12,451 --> 00:38:14,892
And that was the first time that I got exposed to it.

452
00:38:15,513 --> 00:38:25,236
And for anyone that really wants to kind of get into poetry in any meaningful way, you read Robert Frost.

453
00:38:25,756 --> 00:38:27,177
You read Langston Hughes.

454
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:35,504
You read William Shakespeare, wonderful poet, playwright, and all kinds of other things.

455
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:47,534
You read maybe Keats, and Woodworth, or Shelley, or Robert Burns, if you want to go back into the old stuff.

456
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:49,496
You can go to the Greeks.

457
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:50,256
You can go to Ovid.

458
00:38:56,261 --> 00:38:57,982
Oh, there's just so much.

459
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:18,236
But Langston Hughes basically was able to take bits and pieces of poetry from very early poetry, African American poetry, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, through the most contemporary stuff that was being done at the time.

460
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,638
And he was really at the center of the Harlem Renaissance.

461
00:39:22,439 --> 00:39:25,761
And his poetry is beautiful, and if I can get

462
00:39:27,043 --> 00:39:30,869
anywhere near close to that, I'll be a happy, happy person.

463
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:35,117
So I'm at book six, and this is my shameless plug.

464
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,784
This one just, this is hot off the presses, literally.

465
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:48,410
And there's a lot of people that helped me get it published, so I'm, you know, I got a whole bunch of people that I gotta get books out to.

466
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,631
But it's now available.

467
00:39:50,651 --> 00:39:55,875
I'm gonna do a book night on November 18th here at the Community Center.

468
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:57,796
That's gonna be my official book release.

469
00:39:58,577 --> 00:40:05,362
And, you know, we'll read a bunch of stuff and have a good time with the,

470
00:40:05,962 --> 00:40:12,345
former Poet Laureate of Medford, but the Poet Laureate Emeritus, because I was the first one.

471
00:40:13,406 --> 00:40:14,747
So I'm claiming that title.

472
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:16,988
Any parting thoughts?

473
00:40:17,068 --> 00:40:18,048
Any last words?

474
00:40:18,609 --> 00:40:19,809
No, thank you for having me.

475
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:22,151
Thank you to everybody who came to listen.

476
00:40:22,431 --> 00:40:26,513
I'm sure the music's going to be beautiful after, which is part of the reason why you came.

477
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:28,414
But yeah, no, thank you for having me.

478
00:40:28,574 --> 00:40:29,574
I appreciate it.

479
00:40:29,715 --> 00:40:30,395
I love coming.

480
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:31,035
Thank you.

481
00:40:31,135 --> 00:40:32,036
Thank you very much.

482
00:40:32,936 --> 00:40:40,820
Really, thank you for bringing kind of an evolving perspective and really deep experience to the table this evening.

483
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,242
We're in a really critical time in the life of all American cities right now.

484
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:55,266
So to have sane, sober, and hopeful leadership is sorely needed at every level of government.

485
00:40:56,447 --> 00:41:03,312
So, you know, on behalf of the community center, certainly, we wish you all the best in terms of next week's election.

486
00:41:03,972 --> 00:41:13,599
And I'm particularly hopeful that all eligible residents of the city are anxious to vote and be represented as part of the solution.

487
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,826
And to everyone watching out there, thanks so much for your attentiveness and your interest in this discussion.

488
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:25,771
Get ready for something very special on the musical side of the coin.

489
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:32,397
We're going to take a few minutes to reset the stage and share some community center announcements.

490
00:41:33,338 --> 00:41:34,559
Thank you all for being here.

491
00:41:42,206 --> 00:41:53,478

All right.

498
00:45:43,457 --> 00:45:46,819
We are just about good to go.

499
00:45:47,939 --> 00:45:54,321
So I just want to go over a few things that are going on at the community center right now.

500
00:46:00,802 --> 00:46:01,962
Thank you, thank you.

501
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:05,343
Once again, thank you, Mayor Brianna.

502
00:46:06,203 --> 00:46:14,746
So, seniors, join us each week, Tuesday through Thursday, for a nutritious lunch and vibrant fellowship.

503
00:46:14,846 --> 00:46:18,427
Lunch is served at 12 noon, and you can call 781-483-3042 to make a reservation.

504
00:46:24,128 --> 00:46:39,842
So I just wanted to let everybody know that we have been very, very successful with our brick-by-brick fundraising campaign and pretty much sold out every available opportunity in the designated space.

505
00:46:40,463 --> 00:46:46,588
So stay tuned for more news about the purchase and installation of the new bricks.

506
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:48,470
It's a big deal.

507
00:46:48,911 --> 00:46:49,231
Okay.

508
00:46:52,344 --> 00:47:06,658

And they're doing estate and financial planning, a step-by-step guide on life's journey.

00:47:50,806 --> 00:47:59,188
So if you want to know about estate and trusts and so on and so forth, there will be some folks here that can help you do.

Right here at the West Medford Community Center, and it is free All right

518
00:48:15,134 --> 00:48:26,763
Save the date, we are having our 2023 Black Vendors Fair here at the community center on November 25th from 12 p.m.

519
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:28,524
it's a Saturday to 4 p.m.

520
00:48:29,144 --> 00:48:36,390
and we've done several of these and the great thing about it is that you see items and

521
00:48:40,854 --> 00:48:49,221
that you see items and are able to shop for a lot of different things in a small space.

522
00:48:49,641 --> 00:48:51,443
And it's always a great time.

523
00:48:51,523 --> 00:48:54,806
So come out and support the vendors that we'll have.

524
00:48:54,866 --> 00:49:03,933
There'll be all kinds of different things in here, and books, and fragrant oils, and candles, and pottery, and just a whole lot of stuff.

525
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:04,774
And knitting.

526
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:08,077
Thank you very much, Eileen, for pointing that out, including

527
00:49:08,897 --> 00:49:13,339
one of the most beautiful quilts you will ever see, a knit quilt.

528
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,842
Gonna cost you a little something-something if you wanna buy it, but it's absolutely gorgeous.

529
00:49:20,262 --> 00:49:22,903
And hats and mittens and scarves.

530
00:49:23,984 --> 00:49:35,069
The Fabric Arts Club that meets every Thursday here has really, really outdone themselves in bringing, they're gonna be bringing a lot of beautiful items.

531
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:38,711
Come on out and support it, 12 to 4 p.m.

532
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:41,813
at the community center on Saturday, November 25th.

533
00:49:48,692 --> 00:49:50,974
Working on it right now, Eileen, even as we speak.

534
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:58,181
Okay, so A Life in Music, Lost and Found, My Journey as a Musician with Hearing Loss.

535
00:49:58,601 --> 00:50:04,827
It's going to be what we call a talk and play presentation by a woman by the name of Betty Houck.

536
00:50:05,487 --> 00:50:08,130
She's a violinist and a viola player.

537
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:11,072
It's going to be on Thursday, November 16th at 11 a.m.

538
00:50:14,335 --> 00:50:27,721
So, for 50 years, Betty has enjoyed a rich and rewarding career as a professional violist, until the day she realized that she had to retire because of progressive hearing loss.

539
00:50:28,121 --> 00:50:31,642
For three years, she completely turned her back on music.

540
00:50:32,123 --> 00:50:40,206
In this talk and play presentation, she tells the story of how various twists and turns led her back into sharing the joy of music,

541
00:50:40,686 --> 00:50:44,288
while educating and advocating for those with hearing loss.

542
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:54,752
Her talk is punctuated by short musical selections on both the violin and the viola, and the program is about one hour and includes Q&A at the end.

543
00:50:54,892 --> 00:50:56,193
It should be fascinating.

544
00:50:56,693 --> 00:51:05,557
So if you want to come out for an afternoon of talk and play, come see Betty in A Life in Music Lost

545
00:51:07,138 --> 00:51:07,458
All right.

546
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:13,762

551
00:51:37,658 --> 00:51:47,863
So, my friends, it's time to turn our attention to the lyrical miracle we've engaged for this side of the ledger.

552
00:51:48,824 --> 00:51:54,667
Tonight, as I said on the flyer advertising the evening, old friends are the best.

553
00:51:55,527 --> 00:52:06,053
And we are indeed blessed by the return of one of my dearest old friends and someone that has certainly endeared herself to many folks here in this room.

554
00:52:06,573 --> 00:52:12,837
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm West Medford welcome to the inimitable Donna McElroy.

555
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:18,322
All right, just a little bit about Donna.

556
00:52:19,764 --> 00:52:23,228
She is a distinguished music educator.

557
00:52:23,368 --> 00:52:30,417
She retired from Berklee College of Music in 2021 with over 24 years of service.

558
00:52:31,038 --> 00:52:33,120
She is an accomplished

559
00:52:33,701 --> 00:52:54,694
and sought-after background vocalist who worked on, arranger, singer, and background vocalist who worked on the gold and platinum releases of Why Haven't I Heard From You by Reba McEntire, We Shall Be Free by Goth Brooks, Addictive Love by Bebe and CeCe Winans, one of my favorites, and House of Love by Amy Grant.

560
00:52:55,054 --> 00:52:59,597
She has also been a missionary with international Christian artists reaching the earth.

561
00:53:00,317 --> 00:53:11,249
Traveling internationally to Ghana, West Africa, her television appearances include the late lamented Arsenio Hall Show, The Tonight Show, and the Grammy Awards.

562
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,395
She has been designated by Berklee College of Music as Professor Emeritus.

563
00:53:17,316 --> 00:53:25,283
She won a Dove Award for Songs from the Loft and received a Grammy nomination for her Warner Brothers release, Bigger World.

564
00:53:26,163 --> 00:53:36,652
And as did yours truly, she is a graduate of Fisk University, where she was a member of the famed Jubilee Singers.

565
00:53:36,712 --> 00:53:42,757
She is a superb vocalist, a poet, a grand diva in the best sense of the word.

566
00:53:43,117 --> 00:53:46,340
Please welcome back my old friend, Donna McElroy.

567
00:53:47,927 --> 00:53:48,327
Thank you.

568
00:53:48,467 --> 00:53:49,307
Thank you so much.

569
00:53:52,749 --> 00:53:53,149
Thank you.

570
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:53,549
Thank you.

571
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:53,949
Thank you.

572
00:53:53,989 --> 00:53:54,349
Thank you.

573
00:53:54,389 --> 00:53:54,829
Thank you.

574
00:53:54,849 --> 00:53:55,830
Thank you.

575
00:53:55,850 --> 00:54:03,212
Well, this was kind of a short notice request that my friend Terry is

576
00:54:04,096 --> 00:54:05,657
I'm going to do this.

577
00:54:05,677 --> 00:54:09,039
I knew I was going to make that fall, but I'm going to come up off this right here.

578
00:54:09,959 --> 00:54:12,380
Is that OK if I come off the rug?

579
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:17,383
Do I leave the mic on the rug for best sound quality?

580
00:54:17,463 --> 00:54:17,823
OK.

581
00:54:18,784 --> 00:54:20,005
I just feel so far away.

582
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:23,887
I was like, I want to jump on y'all.

583
00:54:31,711 --> 00:54:33,492
You spoke a fisk.

584
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:39,543
I just came back from Nashville.

585
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:47,192
There is a, the Fisk Jubilee Singers has a day, Jubilee 6th every year.

586
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:50,435
It's called Jubilee Day and they do a,

587
00:54:52,177 --> 00:54:59,802
a convocation which this year was, the speaker was Justin, is it Justin Jackson?

588
00:55:01,243 --> 00:55:06,146
The young man who's in the House of Representatives and who was shut down.

589
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:14,812
He was the speaker that morning for the convocation and many of the alumni were in attendance.

590
00:55:15,813 --> 00:55:21,557
Many of the students at the college were in attendance because he's famous.

591
00:55:22,774 --> 00:55:33,022
So that's the word that I want you to think about, is fame and glory versus the behind-the-scenes story.

592
00:55:34,463 --> 00:55:45,531
As you leave here, I want you to think about not being afraid to stay behind the scenes, to be just part of the fabric, not to have to be the

593
00:55:47,162 --> 00:55:52,586
gold thread that's going through the sequin, because, you know, sequins fall off.

594
00:55:54,507 --> 00:55:56,949
So I'm not preaching.

595
00:55:57,189 --> 00:56:06,796
I'm just saying I came from Fisk this past maybe three weeks ago, and there was so much desire for

596
00:56:08,050 --> 00:56:14,033
affirmation, acclamation, glory, news, making the news.

597
00:56:15,073 --> 00:56:24,858
And I feel like sometimes we forget about our foundations and who we are and who we were before we started growing and getting so big.

598
00:56:25,338 --> 00:56:29,240
And then the things that made us, put us on the map start suffering.

599
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,822
And one of those things at this school is the Fisk Jubilee Singers.

600
00:56:33,082 --> 00:56:34,903
We are currently without a leader.

601
00:56:36,664 --> 00:56:57,240
just hired a leader, that is not, for me, that's gonna be the best thing about the whole experience as the Jubilee singers over the next few years, if they are capable of taking on not only the musical challenges,

602
00:56:59,597 --> 00:57:11,600
but also the creative challenges, the directional challenges, because the Negro spiritual started the Jubilee Singers and made them famous.

603
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:16,981
Nashville is known as Music City because of the Fisk Jubilee Singers.

604
00:57:19,681 --> 00:57:21,802
So we can't let the spiritual die.

605
00:57:23,726 --> 00:57:34,952
We have got to learn how to move the spiritual in an arena, into an arena of modernness, of relating from a modern level.

606
00:57:35,933 --> 00:57:48,180
And that means everybody's gotta be invited into the experience of oppression, liberation, struggle, joy, theft, creative rights,

607
00:57:50,013 --> 00:57:51,157
women's autonomy.

608
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,285
Oh, don't get me started.

609
00:57:53,486 --> 00:57:53,747
Anyway.

610
00:57:56,229 --> 00:58:09,598
I just was, I really wanted to honor, just thank you for mentioning Fisk, because I'm so proud of my alma mater, and it's a long, very strange story that I have.

611
00:58:10,158 --> 00:58:14,201
I never told you my story with Fisk, but I'll talk to you about it.

612
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:16,442
It's gonna mess you up.

613
00:58:17,423 --> 00:58:19,184
It's gonna mess you up, okay?

614
00:58:19,404 --> 00:58:19,525
So.

615
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:28,269
Okay, so I usually come and I sing some spirituals and some gospel and I ain't doing that tonight.

616
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:30,891
No, I'm not doing that tonight.

617
00:58:53,463 --> 00:58:56,373
Sittin' in the morning sun

618
00:58:57,857 --> 00:59:06,083
I'll be sitting when the evening comes, watching the ships roll in.

619
00:59:07,283 --> 00:59:11,826
Then I'll watch them roll away again.

620
00:59:12,387 --> 00:59:20,452
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay, watching the tide roll away.

621
00:59:22,193 --> 00:59:26,536
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay, wasting time.

622
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:40,527
I left my home in Kentucky, headed for the Frisco Bay.

623
00:59:40,547 --> 00:59:44,750
And I had nothing to live for.

624
00:59:45,931 --> 01:00:06,560
Looked like nothing gonna come my way So I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay Watching the tide roll away I'm sitting on the dock of the bay Wasting time

625
01:00:11,493 --> 01:00:15,255
look like nothing's gonna change.

626
01:00:16,436 --> 01:00:19,938
Everything still remains the same.

627
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:29,645
I can't do what 10 people tell me to do, so I guess I'll remain the same, yeah.

628
01:00:29,765 --> 01:00:37,630
Sitting here resting my bones, and this loneliness won't leave me alone.

629
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:38,711
No, no, no.

630
01:00:39,491 --> 01:00:47,398
2,000 miles I roamed just to make this dock my home.

631
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:56,965
So I'm just sitting on the dock of the bay, watching the tide roll away.

632
01:00:58,567 --> 01:01:04,431
I'm sitting on the dock of the bay, wasting time.

633
01:01:36,394 --> 01:01:36,835
Thank you.

634
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:42,722
Thank you so much.

635
01:01:43,162 --> 01:01:44,063
Thank you so much.

636
01:01:46,426 --> 01:01:52,053
We've come too far to think about turning around.

637
01:01:53,474 --> 01:01:56,178
At some point in life, you get so far into the journey.

638
01:01:58,530 --> 01:01:59,231
That what do we do?

639
01:01:59,291 --> 01:02:03,516
We're over halfway past the hardest part.

640
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:06,440
So why would we think about giving up now?

641
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:12,988
I mean, it looks like a long, long time before we're going to make it.

642
01:02:13,349 --> 01:02:17,254
And it's probably going to be a long time and a hard journey still ahead.

643
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:25,946
But do you turn around and not ever know the outcome of your sacrifice?

644
01:02:26,706 --> 01:02:28,788
You've got to keep on going.

645
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:40,678
We've come this far by faith.

646
01:02:44,737 --> 01:02:58,664
Leaning on the Lord, trusting in his holy word.

647
01:03:00,465 --> 01:03:05,407
He's never failed me yet.

648
01:03:05,467 --> 01:03:06,307
Anyone that knows it?

649
01:03:07,468 --> 01:03:07,968
Whoa.

650
01:03:12,508 --> 01:03:15,990
Can't turn around.

651
01:03:16,511 --> 01:03:21,414
We've come this far by faith.

652
01:03:21,454 --> 01:03:22,334
Sing it with me now.

653
01:03:22,614 --> 01:03:29,658
We've come this far by faith.

654
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:38,824
Leaning on the Lord.

655
01:03:40,542 --> 01:03:46,504
trusting in his holy word.

656
01:03:48,444 --> 01:03:54,066
He's never failed me yet.

657
01:03:54,826 --> 01:04:04,089
I say, whoa, whoa, whoa, can't turn around.

658
01:04:04,773 --> 01:04:11,016
We've come this far by faith.

659
01:04:11,976 --> 01:04:26,603
Don't be discouraged when trouble's in your life.

660
01:04:27,604 --> 01:04:34,467
Heal, bear your burdens.

661
01:04:35,131 --> 01:04:58,770
And in our trouble and strife That's why we've come this far by faith Leaning on the Lord

662
01:05:00,638 --> 01:05:07,083
Trusting in his holy word.

663
01:05:08,525 --> 01:05:14,289
He's never failed me yet.

664
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:17,712
And say, whoa, whoa.

665
01:05:19,261 --> 01:05:24,645
Whoa, can't turn around.

666
01:05:25,165 --> 01:05:30,209
We've come this far by faith.

667
01:05:30,670 --> 01:05:32,731
Say it one more time.

668
01:05:33,652 --> 01:05:36,774
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

669
01:05:37,395 --> 01:05:41,318
Can't turn around.

670
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:46,161
We've come this far by faith.

671
01:05:52,671 --> 01:05:54,413
We got some gospel singers in here.

672
01:05:54,473 --> 01:05:56,994
Y'all can join in on this next one, too.

673
01:05:57,054 --> 01:05:57,955
No, I'm kidding.

674
01:05:58,035 --> 01:05:59,235
I just sang last week.

675
01:06:19,386 --> 01:06:36,352
in a very important homegoing for the former president of Berkeley, whose father formed and founded the school for local musicians, professional musicians, to learn about the jazz idiom.

676
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:39,313
And many, many years

677
01:06:40,174 --> 01:06:58,097
Later, his son took over the throttle and led the school into hiring much more progressive, musically diverse, like me, people who were in the industry.

678
01:06:59,745 --> 01:07:01,326
And I owe this man a lot.

679
01:07:01,547 --> 01:07:10,534
Lee Burke and his wife were very beautiful, beautiful hosts to me my whole time at Berkeley.

680
01:07:11,335 --> 01:07:18,601
And so I sang this song at that funeral.

681
01:07:20,042 --> 01:07:23,125
And if I get emotional, just go with me.

682
01:07:28,638 --> 01:07:53,367
beams of heaven as I go through this wilderness below guide my feet

683
01:07:56,399 --> 01:08:20,542
in peaceful ways turn my midnights into days when in the darkness I would grope

684
01:08:21,721 --> 01:08:33,605
Faith always sees a ray of hope.

685
01:08:34,525 --> 01:08:46,569
And soon from all life's grief and danger, I shall be free.

686
01:08:51,215 --> 01:08:54,317
someday.

687
01:08:56,018 --> 01:09:10,605
I do not know how long till we'll be or what the future

688
01:09:12,981 --> 01:09:38,778
The future holds for me But this I know If Jesus leads me I shall be free I shall see God

689
01:09:40,610 --> 01:09:44,251
I'll see my mother.

690
01:09:45,151 --> 01:09:48,792
I'll see my father.

691
01:09:49,552 --> 01:09:53,133
I'll see my sister.

692
01:09:53,713 --> 01:09:57,274
I'll see my brother.

693
01:09:58,854 --> 01:10:09,117
I shall get home some, some day.

694
01:10:12,645 --> 01:10:26,850
Beautiful.

695
01:10:33,092 --> 01:10:36,333
I really sing very seriously, but I'm a goof.

696
01:10:37,573 --> 01:10:38,794
I'm a real goof.

697
01:10:40,154 --> 01:10:41,915
I grew up being a goof.

698
01:10:42,395 --> 01:10:43,816
I went to a doctor yesterday.

699
01:10:44,917 --> 01:10:48,179
If you notice, my right shoulder is higher than the left shoulder.

700
01:10:48,759 --> 01:10:52,161
You notice that I'm not leaning consciously.

701
01:10:52,621 --> 01:10:54,062
He just said, walk down the hall.

702
01:10:54,122 --> 01:10:55,223
And I said, OK.

703
01:10:55,483 --> 01:10:56,544
And I walked down the hall.

704
01:10:56,564 --> 01:10:57,244
He said, OK.

705
01:10:58,165 --> 01:11:00,466
Yeah, we got a lot of work to do.

706
01:11:01,687 --> 01:11:04,268
I went to be adjusted by a chiropractic.

707
01:11:04,308 --> 01:11:05,749
And he's not a chiropractic.

708
01:11:05,789 --> 01:11:08,751
His technical term is kinesiologist.

709
01:11:10,865 --> 01:11:15,407
So that was a new and learning experience for me because I did not get one bone cracked.

710
01:11:15,587 --> 01:11:27,351
I left there with a bunch of exercises and muscle assignments to do up against the door to strengthen my left side of my body.

711
01:11:27,391 --> 01:11:29,751
He said, your left side is just weak, weak, weak.

712
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:34,253
This thigh is just, this muscle is not, and here's what you're gonna do.

713
01:11:34,713 --> 01:11:37,114
And he gave me these things, you lay on this and you,

714
01:11:38,414 --> 01:11:39,255
It was amazing.

715
01:11:39,555 --> 01:11:44,999
And when he got finished showing me how to do the exercise, I was feeling better.

716
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:47,420
When I left the place, I felt great.

717
01:11:48,221 --> 01:11:49,442
I felt 10 years younger.

718
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:54,205
And then, of course, I went home and sat down in front of the television.

719
01:11:57,005 --> 01:12:10,654
started with Netflix and then I caught myself and I'm like, oh, OK, wait, wait, wait.

720
01:12:11,015 --> 01:12:16,038
Let me move to the other side of the sofa.

721
01:12:16,759 --> 01:12:19,080
So pray for me because it's a journey.

722
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:20,601
It's not a destination.

723
01:12:20,661 --> 01:12:22,262
This is not my destination.

724
01:12:22,923 --> 01:12:25,064
This is me seeing you on my journey.

725
01:12:27,846 --> 01:12:29,146
Let's see.

726
01:12:33,128 --> 01:12:34,028
What do you want to hear next?

727
01:12:34,429 --> 01:12:38,050
Something church or something?

728
01:12:41,512 --> 01:12:42,492
Church is fine?

729
01:12:43,112 --> 01:12:43,753
Is that what you said?

730
01:12:44,953 --> 01:12:45,774
Something joyful?

731
01:12:47,914 --> 01:12:48,755
Something joyful.

732
01:12:52,496 --> 01:12:53,417
Something joyful.

733
01:12:55,313 --> 01:13:01,315
Something joyful, let me see, oh.

734
01:13:01,455 --> 01:13:07,137
Let's see, how about, this is called His Name's So Sweet.

735
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:13,159
And it's a spiritual, and it has a call and response, so.

736
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:19,021
I wanna teach you the middle part of it.

737
01:13:19,201 --> 01:13:24,043
You don't have to sing, all you have to do is say, yes, yes, I do love my Jesus.

738
01:13:25,691 --> 01:13:31,516
You don't have to sing it, although there is parts, but yes, yes, I do love my Jesus, okay?

739
01:13:32,296 --> 01:13:37,420
Let me see, let me put it in a key that I can sing it in.

740
01:13:37,761 --> 01:13:43,945
I was a soprano lead singer in this song when I was 20, 19, 18, 21, but now I'm 68 and I'm singing more like Billy Eckstine.

741
01:13:43,965 --> 01:13:45,226
Soprano to baritone.

742
01:13:54,986 --> 01:13:55,986
God love you all.

743
01:13:56,006 --> 01:13:56,046
OK.

744
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:05,209
It says, oh Lord, I just come from the fountain.

745
01:14:05,569 --> 01:14:08,310
I'm just from the fountain, Lord.

746
01:14:08,390 --> 01:14:10,451
I just come from the fountain.

747
01:14:10,811 --> 01:14:12,712
His name's so sweet.

748
01:14:12,972 --> 01:14:15,612
Oh Lord, I just come from the fountain.

749
01:14:15,632 --> 01:14:18,913
I'm just from the fountain, Lord.

750
01:14:19,033 --> 01:14:20,534
I just come from the fountain.

751
01:14:21,368 --> 01:14:23,569
His name's so sweet.

752
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:26,531
Oh, sinner, do you love Jesus?

753
01:14:26,951 --> 01:14:29,633
Yes, yes, I do love Jesus.

754
01:14:29,653 --> 01:14:31,594
Sinner, do you love Jesus?

755
01:14:31,994 --> 01:14:34,055
His name's so sweet.

756
01:14:34,115 --> 01:14:36,937
Oh, Lord, I just come from the fountain.

757
01:14:37,417 --> 01:14:40,239
I'm just from the fountain, Lord.

758
01:14:40,339 --> 01:14:42,300
I just come from the fountain.

759
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,561
His name's so sweet.

760
01:14:44,841 --> 01:14:47,103
Oh, Lord, I just come from the fountain.

761
01:14:47,981 --> 01:14:51,984
I'm just, Lord, just come from the fountain.

762
01:14:52,345 --> 01:14:54,526
That's right, Clapper, I wanna hear you.

763
01:14:54,607 --> 01:14:55,447
So sweet.

764
01:14:55,687 --> 01:14:58,970
Oh, sinner, do you love Jesus?

765
01:14:58,990 --> 01:15:00,511
Yes, yes, I do love Jesus.

766
01:15:00,551 --> 01:15:03,073
Sinner, do you love Jesus?

767
01:15:03,514 --> 01:15:05,375
His name's so sweet.

768
01:15:05,536 --> 01:15:08,138
Oh, Lord, I just come from the fountain.

769
01:15:08,818 --> 01:15:11,641
I'm just from the fountain, Lord.

770
01:15:11,661 --> 01:15:13,162
I just come from the fountain.

771
01:15:14,002 --> 01:15:16,845
His name's so sweet, oh Lord.

772
01:15:16,865 --> 01:15:19,267
I just come from the fountain.

773
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:21,969
I'm just from the fountain, Lord.

774
01:15:22,029 --> 01:15:23,911
I just come from the fountain.

775
01:15:23,931 --> 01:15:26,513
His name's so sweet.

776
01:15:26,973 --> 01:15:29,515
Class leader, do you love Jesus?

777
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:32,438
Yes, yes, I do love Jesus.

778
01:15:32,558 --> 01:15:34,359
Leader, do you love Jesus?

779
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,502
His name's so sweet, oh Lord.

780
01:15:40,922 --> 01:15:44,863
From the fountain, Lord, I've just come from the fountain.

781
01:15:44,883 --> 01:15:49,844
His name's so sweet, oh Lord, I've just come from the fountain.

782
01:15:50,404 --> 01:15:55,005
I'm just from the fountain, Lord, I've just come from the fountain.

783
01:15:55,486 --> 01:16:00,287
His name's so sweet, I know that you love Jesus.

784
01:16:00,327 --> 01:16:03,087
He said, yes, yes, I do love Jesus.

785
01:16:03,107 --> 01:16:05,088
Oh Lord, do you love Jesus?

786
01:16:05,788 --> 01:16:07,789
His name's so sweet.

787
01:16:07,890 --> 01:16:10,932
Oh, Lord, I just come from the fountain.

788
01:16:11,372 --> 01:16:13,854
Just from the fountain, Lord.

789
01:16:13,974 --> 01:16:15,815
Just come from the fountain.

790
01:16:16,275 --> 01:16:17,716
His name's so sweet.

791
01:16:18,337 --> 01:16:21,059
Oh, Lord, I just come from the fountain.

792
01:16:21,499 --> 01:16:24,201
I'm just from the fountain, Lord.

793
01:16:24,281 --> 01:16:26,262
I just come from the fountain.

794
01:16:26,663 --> 01:16:30,185
His name's so sweet.

795
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:45,254
There were utilizations for the various spirituals.

796
01:16:47,675 --> 01:16:53,420
And the utilization for this one was, tomorrow is the day we're getting ready to go.

797
01:16:54,641 --> 01:16:56,583
We're leaving tomorrow.

798
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:00,123
Is everybody going?

799
01:17:00,603 --> 01:17:02,004
Are you ready, pastor?

800
01:17:02,304 --> 01:17:03,524
Are you ready, sister?

801
01:17:03,625 --> 01:17:04,865
Are you ready, brother?

802
01:17:05,005 --> 01:17:06,086
Are you ready, sinner?

803
01:17:06,386 --> 01:17:08,247
Are you ready, believer?

804
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:09,768
Whoever's ready.

805
01:17:10,648 --> 01:17:11,729
I've just come from the fountain.

806
01:17:11,769 --> 01:17:12,509
I got word.

807
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:14,390
They gonna be waiting for us.

808
01:17:14,951 --> 01:17:26,057
A couple of leagues of this property over, and they gonna take us into glory, take us into freedom, take us into peace of mind.

809
01:17:26,497 --> 01:17:27,658
That's what that song is about.

810
01:17:28,198 --> 01:17:32,182
That's why the person saying, calling it says, his name is so sweet.

811
01:17:33,183 --> 01:17:34,485
I just come from the fountain.

812
01:17:34,525 --> 01:17:36,507
They told us we're getting ready to leave tomorrow.

813
01:17:38,089 --> 01:17:39,250
That's so sweet to hear.

814
01:17:40,171 --> 01:17:41,492
Are you ready, Zid and Elder?

815
01:17:42,232 --> 01:17:43,233
Do you love Jesus?

816
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:49,037
Zid and Elder, that's the preacher, the presiding elder.

817
01:17:49,738 --> 01:17:52,360
He says, yes, yes, I do love my Jesus.

818
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,582
Sinner, do you love Jesus?

819
01:17:54,842 --> 01:17:56,443
He says, yes, yes.

820
01:17:56,543 --> 01:17:58,945
You know, the sinners are louder than everybody else.

821
01:18:00,266 --> 01:18:01,387
I'm not gonna preach on y'all.

822
01:18:04,670 --> 01:18:05,991
Don't get me started.

823
01:18:09,735 --> 01:18:10,135
OK.

824
01:18:10,836 --> 01:18:18,042
So I chose some songs that are just near and dear to my heart that I've known since I was like 12, 13.

825
01:18:18,302 --> 01:18:22,106
And so I'm going to sing one of those for you.

826
01:18:24,668 --> 01:18:26,450
This song was first recorded by

827
01:18:29,266 --> 01:18:36,810
Ooh, it was so far back, but the person who made it famous for the African-American community was Donny Hathaway.

828
01:18:39,432 --> 01:18:45,135
And it started out with a really lovely piano thing, and I'm practicing.

829
01:18:46,876 --> 01:18:49,257
Just so you know, I might do it for you next time I'm coming.

830
01:18:50,598 --> 01:18:51,058
Lies.

831
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,020
It says...

832
01:18:57,612 --> 01:19:05,334
I've been so many places in my life and time.

833
01:19:07,654 --> 01:19:10,775
I sung a lot of songs.

834
01:19:12,376 --> 01:19:17,137
I've made some bad rhymes.

835
01:19:18,397 --> 01:19:26,599
I've acted out my life in stages with 10,000 people watching.

836
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:36,031
But we're alone now and I'm singing this song for you.

837
01:19:37,733 --> 01:19:44,758
I know your image of me is what I hope to be.

838
01:19:45,419 --> 01:19:46,080
Bye, Mayor.

839
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:50,083
I treated you unkindly.

840
01:19:51,444 --> 01:19:53,566
Thank you so much, can't you see?

841
01:19:55,981 --> 01:19:58,662
There's no one more important to me.

842
01:19:58,682 --> 01:20:05,164
Baby, can't you see through me?

843
01:20:05,184 --> 01:20:13,547
Because we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.

844
01:20:15,888 --> 01:20:18,229
You taught me precious secrets.

845
01:20:19,514 --> 01:20:44,679
♪ For the truth withholding nothing ♪ ♪ You came out in front and I was hiding ♪ ♪ But now I'm so much better ♪ ♪ And if my words don't come together ♪ ♪ Listen to the melody ♪

846
01:20:46,052 --> 01:21:13,809
♪ Cause my love is in there hiding ♪ ♪ I love you in a place where there's no space or time ♪ ♪ I love you for my life ♪

847
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:19,060
You are a friend of mine.

848
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:30,243
And when my life is over, remember when we were here together.

849
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:38,386
We were alone and I was singing my song.

850
01:21:40,886 --> 01:21:48,352
I was singing my song I was singing my song for you

851
01:22:23,786 --> 01:22:24,347
I'm finished.

852
01:22:28,812 --> 01:22:29,052
Huh?

853
01:22:30,534 --> 01:22:30,954
Skylar?

854
01:22:31,054 --> 01:22:31,575
Oh, Skylar.

855
01:22:32,316 --> 01:22:33,537
I shouldn't have told you that.

856
01:22:34,178 --> 01:22:35,459
She saw my list.

857
01:22:36,260 --> 01:22:37,201
She saw my list.

858
01:22:39,822 --> 01:22:49,829
You can see I'm struggling with stuff with the post-COVID attitude.

859
01:22:50,289 --> 01:22:51,050
That's what I call it.

860
01:22:51,790 --> 01:22:53,491
My bronchial system got an attitude.

861
01:22:53,511 --> 01:22:57,274
It's like, you didn't protect yourself, and now I'm going to pay.

862
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:08,282
Yeah, so, please forgive me, but I hope you, I sing with the same spirit whether my voice is working or not, because I don't believe I'm singing from here.

863
01:23:08,602 --> 01:23:09,904
I believe I'm singing from here.

864
01:23:11,425 --> 01:23:12,667
I've always sung from here.

865
01:23:13,286 --> 01:23:14,387
more than any other thing.

866
01:23:14,427 --> 01:23:19,531
So I've always, wherever I was, no matter what I sang, it was always from here.

867
01:23:19,872 --> 01:23:28,799
And then let people judge or critique or comment on the instrumental prowess or lack thereof.

868
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:36,306
Because the instrument, the main instrument that I use is here, is my soul, my heart, okay?

869
01:23:38,905 --> 01:23:44,390
With that said, let's see.

870
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:45,551
I don't remember.

871
01:23:45,651 --> 01:23:46,271
Let me think.

872
01:23:47,052 --> 01:23:48,513
I used to sing this really high.

873
01:23:48,573 --> 01:23:53,077
Skylark, have you anything to say to me?

874
01:23:53,177 --> 01:23:54,378
But that ain't going to work tonight.

875
01:23:57,381 --> 01:24:06,128
Skylark, have you anything to say to me?

876
01:24:09,130 --> 01:24:27,920
can you tell me where my love can be is there a shadow in the mist where someone's waiting to be kissed Skylar

877
01:24:29,268 --> 01:24:52,460
have you seen a valley green with spring where my heart can go a journey in over the meadows in the lane through a blossom covered lane and in your lonely flight

878
01:24:54,977 --> 01:25:09,889
haven't you heard the music in the night wonderful music faint as the will of the wisp crazy

879
01:25:13,135 --> 01:25:21,480
Sad as a gypsy serenading the moon, oh.

880
01:25:21,861 --> 01:25:24,382
Should I take the key down so I'll make it through the next bridge?

881
01:25:27,004 --> 01:25:34,149
Skylark, I don't know if you can find these things.

882
01:25:35,362 --> 01:25:39,626
But my heart is riding on your wings.

883
01:25:40,507 --> 01:25:47,193
So if you see them anywhere, won't you lead me there?

884
01:25:47,213 --> 01:25:47,253
Oh.

885
01:26:09,887 --> 01:26:13,689
That's the worst sound I've made tonight, and you gave me the longest applause.

886
01:26:13,749 --> 01:26:16,351
So there's something to that.

887
01:26:16,431 --> 01:26:23,375
I think I'll get really sick for the next gig and sing through a lot of phlegm and have it just come up while I'm singing.

888
01:26:23,915 --> 01:26:28,358
That seems to turn folks on.

889
01:26:28,518 --> 01:26:31,040
Even great singers can screw up.

890
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:33,841
Really, really can do what?

891
01:26:34,241 --> 01:26:34,462
What?

892
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:41,659
He's laughing at me, oh my God.

893
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:50,745
Everybody online watching from their homes in the comfort of their homes, this looks like something easy to do, but this is not an easy gig.

894
01:26:52,666 --> 01:27:02,113
I don't care if it was nobody in the room, but the camera takes all of the chance for humanity, for flaw.

895
01:27:08,436 --> 01:27:12,817
and smashes it in your face and says, you thought you was going to sing good tonight, didn't you?

896
01:27:12,937 --> 01:27:13,358
Uh-huh.

897
01:27:13,418 --> 01:27:13,958
OK, watch this.

898
01:27:17,339 --> 01:27:19,339
That's what I think my throat is doing tonight.

899
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:19,720
OK.

900
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:24,181
Let's see.

901
01:27:24,201 --> 01:27:25,381
So what was Skylark?

902
01:27:25,641 --> 01:27:32,284
Oh, this is one that I, it's kind of a

903
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:37,820
challenging, so let me see if I can make it through.

904
01:27:38,060 --> 01:27:53,910
This is called, You Must Believe in Spring, which is perfect because we're heading into winter, and it says, it's just encouragement for holding on to the next change of seasons.

905
01:27:55,632 --> 01:28:10,828
When lonely feelings chill the meadows of your mind, just think if winter comes can spring be far behind?

906
01:28:14,251 --> 01:28:32,862
Beneath the deepest snows, a secret of the rose is merely that it knows you must be leaving spring.

907
01:28:34,864 --> 01:28:41,688
Just as the tree is sure its leaves will reappear,

908
01:28:42,987 --> 01:28:51,432
It knows its emptiness is just the time of year.

909
01:28:51,973 --> 01:29:00,678
The frozen mountain dreams of April's melting streams.

910
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:04,381
How crystal clear it seems.

911
01:29:04,901 --> 01:29:09,144
You must believe in spring.

912
01:29:11,627 --> 01:29:18,891
You must believe in love and trust it's on its way.

913
01:29:20,693 --> 01:29:28,257
Just as the sleeping rose awaits the kiss of May.

914
01:29:28,757 --> 01:29:36,502
So in a world of woe, of things that come and go,

915
01:29:39,452 --> 01:29:49,538
where what you think you know you can't be certain of.

916
01:29:50,479 --> 01:30:01,226
You must believe in spring and love.

917
01:30:24,704 --> 01:30:25,964
How much damage have I done?

918
01:30:27,425 --> 01:30:28,446
Can I say my poem?

919
01:30:28,926 --> 01:30:30,027
You want me to say my poem?

920
01:30:32,475 --> 01:30:37,637
I don't want to compete, but this came on my heart, and I can't get enough of it.

921
01:30:38,618 --> 01:30:40,739
This is called Peanuts and Poetry.

922
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:44,641
I think I'm going to be finished when I finish this one.

923
01:30:45,581 --> 01:30:46,101
I'll cry.

924
01:30:46,301 --> 01:30:46,962
I'll be crying.

925
01:30:52,744 --> 01:30:53,865
OK.

926
01:30:57,727 --> 01:31:00,508
Knock down, drag out.

927
01:31:02,347 --> 01:31:06,791
Is it really worth it, calling names we know so many of?

928
01:31:09,413 --> 01:31:14,156
Freedom's baby, can we ever birth it?

929
01:31:15,558 --> 01:31:18,680
Born of all this hatred, not of love?

930
01:31:21,422 --> 01:31:25,986
Win the prize and the world denies you, never acknowledging what you've done.

931
01:31:28,331 --> 01:31:32,575
Peanuts and poetry, how fast do we have to run?

932
01:31:35,418 --> 01:31:41,223
Evers never thought we'd still be fighting when he gave his life along with King.

933
01:31:43,385 --> 01:31:51,413
Waller's treasures all the world delighting, giving Bessie bluesy songs to sing.

934
01:31:53,214 --> 01:32:00,498
Countless painters colored in the truth, light and dark, two worlds in a great divide.

935
01:32:01,878 --> 01:32:06,521
Peanuts and poetry, excellence can't be denied.

936
01:32:07,701 --> 01:32:14,245
So today, when anyone has to be formally known as anything but free,

937
01:32:16,249 --> 01:32:25,574
We're all evidence of faith that stands in defense of the sanctified, redeemed, and everlasting peace.

938
01:32:28,856 --> 01:32:38,381
Carver, Dunbar, Ellington, and Blakey, Johnson and Du Bois all paid the price.

939
01:32:40,082 --> 01:32:44,384
Cullen, Douglas, Josephine all shaky,

940
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,322
Unknown nannies full of free advice.

941
01:32:50,004 --> 01:32:56,249
Lincoln looming looking down on Marion as she sang of rivers running deep.

942
01:32:58,632 --> 01:33:04,096
Peanuts and poetry have saved us from a tortured sleep.

943
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:06,999
Thank you.

944
01:33:13,391 --> 01:33:13,832
Thank you.

945
01:33:14,093 --> 01:33:15,335
Thank you Terry for having me.

946
01:33:20,907 --> 01:33:21,849
Thank you very much.

947
01:33:22,250 --> 01:33:22,892
God bless you.

948
01:33:37,577 --> 01:33:42,940
The people that love you best will come when no one else will come.

949
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:48,383
And Donna, thank you for coming.

950
01:33:49,823 --> 01:33:52,605
You know how I feel, so I don't really have to say that.

951
01:33:53,465 --> 01:33:55,026
But absolutely, absolutely.

952
01:33:55,046 --> 01:33:55,686
Keep smiling.

953
01:33:58,436 --> 01:33:59,156
I know you can.

954
01:34:01,538 --> 01:34:04,139
Listen, thanks for coming out, everybody.

955
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:21,290
We so appreciate having these evenings together because, you know, as we look around, you know, at that top part of the wall and the bottom part of the wall, so many of the folks that would love to be here are no longer with us and can't be here.

956
01:34:22,290 --> 01:34:29,075
So we're just so thankful for the ones that are still with us and can come out and enjoy these evenings together.

957
01:34:29,436 --> 01:34:33,979
I want to thank once again Kevin Harrington, Method Community Media.

958
01:34:36,180 --> 01:34:44,026
For me, he's, you know, and for us here at the Community Center, he's become another one of those friends that comes when you call him and

959
01:34:44,726 --> 01:34:50,291
doesn't fuss with you or grouse, even though he's tired and he's still got a long way to go when he leaves here.

960
01:34:50,371 --> 01:34:51,973
So I appreciate you.

961
01:34:51,993 --> 01:34:52,753
You know I do.

962
01:34:53,554 --> 01:35:08,667
I want to thank everybody from the Medford Arts Council and the Massachusetts Cultural Council for providing the grant that makes these evenings together available to us.

963
01:35:09,890 --> 01:35:23,806
It's our community home, and we just keep trying to do things that keep us all engaged and keep the joy, as you so eloquently put it, that keep the joy with us.

964
01:35:25,027 --> 01:35:27,590
So I've got a bunch of announcements.

965
01:35:29,112 --> 01:35:30,533
Look at the bulletin board.

966
01:35:31,294 --> 01:35:34,197
There's plenty of stuff going on at the community center.

967
01:35:34,417 --> 01:35:37,821
The pumpkin smash is happening tomorrow, right?

968
01:35:37,921 --> 01:35:39,342
So if you want to bring...

969
01:35:40,223 --> 01:35:48,751
If you got pumpkins, okay, and you don't want to throw them in the trash, obviously, bring them to the pumpkin smash, because they'll get smashed.

970
01:35:49,791 --> 01:36:03,563
And then they'll end up as compost, you know, and something that's good for the planet, as opposed to, you know, where this kind of stuff usually ends up, which is garbage and, you know, landfills and dung heaps, and we don't want any of that.

971
01:36:06,666 --> 01:36:07,667
Lisa, what else?

972
01:36:12,658 --> 01:36:13,702
I do, I do.

973
01:36:13,802 --> 01:36:17,476
Okay, so I'm just gonna tease this because there's gonna be more coming.

974
01:36:19,358 --> 01:36:27,721
A few years back, we started to get the ball rolling toward a commemoration of the black veterans from the West Medford community.

975
01:36:28,841 --> 01:36:37,024
You know, time and tide kind of made us veer away from that because we had other work to do and other things going on.

976
01:36:37,604 --> 01:36:40,806
But we recently were awarded a $20,000 grant

977
01:36:46,528 --> 01:36:51,970
by mass humanities to re-engage with that work.

978
01:36:52,030 --> 01:36:53,850
So you'll be hearing more about it.

979
01:36:53,910 --> 01:36:55,131
There's a lot to do.

980
01:36:56,171 --> 01:37:01,934
But we finally have what we consider to be the right kind of resources in order to do it well.

981
01:37:02,794 --> 01:37:08,196
So I'll be getting some folks together and talking to a lot of folks.

982
01:37:09,176 --> 01:37:36,663
pictures and memorabilia and artifacts and there'll be video and interviews and all kinds of things that will make this project come together so that we can visually represent some of the heroes from the West Memphis community that were involved in World War II, the Korean conflict, probably tipping on into the Vietnam era so that we can tell a pretty full and thorough story.

983
01:37:37,804 --> 01:37:44,951
There's so many stories that this community has to tell, and we feel like if we don't tell them, who will?

984
01:37:45,492 --> 01:37:53,880
So that's why we're embarking on this project in a more ambitious and thorough way this time, and we're gonna get it done.

985
01:37:54,521 --> 01:37:56,062
We're gonna get it done, okay?

986
01:37:57,864 --> 01:38:03,588
Keep an eye out for that second pad of bricks that's coming.

987
01:38:04,048 --> 01:38:08,371
I think all together the pad is going to hold 78.

988
01:38:10,692 --> 01:38:13,294
It'll be a combination of 8x8 bricks and 4x8 bricks.

989
01:38:15,975 --> 01:38:17,616
And we're fully subscribed.

990
01:38:17,656 --> 01:38:19,196
I don't have another space left.

991
01:38:19,256 --> 01:38:23,137
So I'm real proud of the fact that folks have come forward.

992
01:38:23,238 --> 01:38:36,161
And really, they're folks from across the city, folks from really across the nation, because a lot of folks that have left Medford called in their brick orders so that their families could be commemorated.

993
01:38:36,261 --> 01:38:44,204
So it's going to be, just like the first pad, it's going to be a real nice commemoration of life in West Medford.

994
01:38:46,165 --> 01:38:46,926
That's all I got.

995
01:38:48,067 --> 01:38:48,447
Okay.

996
01:38:48,668 --> 01:38:49,308
Is that enough?

997
01:38:49,729 --> 01:38:50,089
Okay.

998
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:51,070
Yes.

999
01:38:51,831 --> 01:38:52,351
Oh, yes.

1000
01:38:52,912 --> 01:39:00,319
So, November 25th, Saturday, November 25th, here from 12 to 4, the Black Vendors Fair.

1001
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:03,141
It's going to be, you know, it'll be a great affair.

1002
01:39:03,782 --> 01:39:05,063
I think you'll really enjoy it.

1003
01:39:05,424 --> 01:39:08,827
Everybody who has come out to the ones that we've had in the past have really, really

1004
01:39:09,367 --> 01:39:10,828
enjoyed and appreciated them.

1005
01:39:11,328 --> 01:39:16,510
And listen, it's gift-giving season, so nobody goes to the mall anymore.

1006
01:39:16,570 --> 01:39:21,132
You know, everybody sits at the computer and types in, you know, a website.

1007
01:39:21,192 --> 01:39:32,656
So come on out, see your neighbors, and there'll be some really, really unique and great gifts to be able to buy and enjoy either yourself or share with your family members.

1008
01:39:33,257 --> 01:39:35,718
So we hope to see you at the Black Vendors.

1009
01:39:36,758 --> 01:39:41,639
Okay, so the next First Friday will be, I think it's December 1st, right?

1010
01:39:42,119 --> 01:39:49,921
Unless, you know, we decide to push it out an extra week, which is a possibility, just because December is such a busy month.

1011
01:39:50,201 --> 01:39:54,702
In any case, we will be holding a First Friday next month.

1012
01:39:55,442 --> 01:39:56,823
So I've got work to do.

1013
01:39:59,263 --> 01:40:00,844
Let's see, how we doing?

1014
01:40:01,644 --> 01:40:02,604
We're good on time?

1015
01:40:04,515 --> 01:40:06,137
And that's a wrap.

1016
01:40:06,438 --> 01:40:10,262
So join us in December for another First Friday.

1017
01:40:10,643 --> 01:40:13,286
Thanks to Lisa for making my job easy.

1018
01:40:13,646 --> 01:40:16,069
And thanks to you all for coming out once again.

1019
01:40:16,590 --> 01:40:17,551
Have a great night.

1020
01:40:17,591 --> 01:40:18,772
Be safe out there.

1021
01:40:19,253 --> 01:40:20,835
And we'll see you again soon.

1022
01:40:34,119 --> 01:40:34,319
Bye.
