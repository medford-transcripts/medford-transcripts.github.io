23
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:09,248

[SPEAKER_09]: Acknowledgement of review of continued nondisclosure of City Council Executive Session Minutes dated August 19, 2025 under the Open Meeting Law.

30
00:22:27,009 --> 00:22:38,197
[SPEAKER_09]: acknowledging that we are, um, not disclosing the minutes of the executive session of the City Council dated August 19th 2025 because they're still exempt from disclosure under provisions of the open meeting law.

31
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:46,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Reports of committees 24 073 and 24 354 offered by Councilor Leming.

00:22:46,643 --> 00:22:47,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Leming.

33
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:48,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

34
00:22:48,664 --> 00:22:56,490
[SPEAKER_03]: At the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee, we discussed the results of a few recent listening sessions and released the summer newsletter motion to approve.

35
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:02,293
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion to approve by Councilor Leming, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

36
00:23:02,333 --> 00:23:02,993

37
00:23:03,794 --> 00:23:04,214

[SPEAKER_09]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

40
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:14,498
[SPEAKER_09]: 25149, resolution to establish a recruitment and hiring process for the city clerk.

41
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:20,001
[SPEAKER_09]: We discussed this last week and I do have an update from the solicitor.

42
00:23:22,021 --> 00:23:23,222
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me one second here.

43
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:36,921
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so I went back and forth a little bit with Solicitor Foley on these questions that the council had about the process.

44
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:44,766
[SPEAKER_09]: I know folks were talking about wanting to see if we could all do a dupli-mary screening and how that would affect executive session.

45
00:23:44,786 --> 00:23:47,828
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just read, basically I think there's two options.

46
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:57,968
[SPEAKER_09]: One is three members could meet in a preliminary screening committee, which is something that is specifically spoken about in the open meeting law.

47
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:08,372
[SPEAKER_09]: And that group could, it's not a quorum of the body, that group could decide to go into executive session to screen applicants for an open meeting.

48
00:24:09,123 --> 00:24:10,744
[SPEAKER_09]: for basically four interviews.

49
00:24:11,585 --> 00:24:21,413
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing that we could do is all members could look at the resumes and recommend whoever they want to be interviewed, and then that could move forward.

50
00:24:22,855 --> 00:24:33,283
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, all of those people would move to the interview stages, and then Councilors who want to be involved in those interviews, one or two in each of the rounds could be part of the interviews, and then

51
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:42,669
[SPEAKER_09]: In either direction, we would receive three finalists who would then be coming before us in a public session and being, we would pick from the three finalists.

52
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:48,176
[SPEAKER_09]: I can read a little bit more or I could go to, I'll just read a little bit more.

53
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:51,700
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from the solicitor.

54
00:24:53,103 --> 00:24:56,705
[SPEAKER_09]: The AG's Division of Open Government issued a determination on this issue and held as follows.

55
00:24:57,165 --> 00:25:07,289
[SPEAKER_09]: A public body may create a preliminary screening committee to interview applicants for employment or appointment under General Law Chapter 30A, Section 1821A.8.

56
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:19,315
[SPEAKER_09]: That preliminary screening committee may meet in executive session under Purpose 8 to, quote, consider or interview applicants for employment or appointment if the chair declares that an open meeting will have a detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants

57
00:25:19,915 --> 00:25:28,278
[SPEAKER_09]: Provided, however, that this clause shall not apply to any meeting, including meetings of a preliminary screening committee, to consider and interview applicants who have passed a prior preliminary screening.

58
00:25:28,878 --> 00:25:42,062
[SPEAKER_09]: And a preliminary screening is defined as, quote, the initial stage of screening applicants conducted by a committee or subcommittee of a public body solely for the purpose of providing to the public body a list of those applicants qualified for further consideration or interview.

59
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:47,345
[SPEAKER_09]: And it says that a preliminary screening committee must consist of fewer than a quorum of the members of the parent body.

60
00:25:47,685 --> 00:25:50,547
[SPEAKER_09]: And it may include additional members who are not members of the parent body.

61
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you have to keep minutes.

62
00:25:55,369 --> 00:25:56,970
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anything else in here?

63
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:10,478
[SPEAKER_09]: Solicitor fully said, in my opinion, less than a quorum of the city council members could serve on a preliminary screening committee, review the applications and resumes and assist in deciding who warrants an interview in round one.

64
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:14,978
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll stop there.

65
00:26:15,238 --> 00:26:20,760
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll go to Councilor Lazzaro and then Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Tseng.

66
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazzaro.

67
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

68
00:26:23,161 --> 00:26:28,842
[SPEAKER_01]: My personal preference would be for us all to receive resumes and express our preference that way.

69
00:26:28,862 --> 00:26:41,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it avoids open meeting law issues and gives us all an opportunity to see who the applicants are without making anybody feel

70
00:26:41,674 --> 00:26:49,521
[SPEAKER_01]: put on the spot too early or that just seems like the most democratic way to go about it from my perspective.

71
00:26:50,422 --> 00:26:50,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

72
00:26:51,423 --> 00:26:51,884
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

73
00:26:52,924 --> 00:26:53,845
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

74
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:55,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Council President.

75
00:26:55,307 --> 00:26:56,968
[SPEAKER_04]: I concur with my fellow council.

76
00:26:56,988 --> 00:27:01,813
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important that this council and this body maintain

77
00:27:03,112 --> 00:27:07,034
[SPEAKER_04]: the total control of who this person is.

78
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:25,003
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's important that I was going to lead with that, that once we all see the applications that we would report or send those top three recommendations or if we find that we found four out of, let's say, 10, that we

79
00:27:26,031 --> 00:27:29,353
[SPEAKER_04]: give it to our committee of three council president bears.

80
00:27:29,413 --> 00:27:30,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we talked about that.

81
00:27:30,553 --> 00:27:37,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And, um, and then the final three would then the committee of three.

82
00:27:38,477 --> 00:27:49,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel comfortable with the committee of three, then moving forward, uh, and making sure we don't violate any open meeting laws and then bring us to the final final steps.

83
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:51,223
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's important that, um,

84
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:54,878
[SPEAKER_04]: this position doesn't come from the administration.

85
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:16,692
[SPEAKER_04]: This position is the only position that works for us and we need to make sure that we have the trust of that person and their goals and our goals and the shared objectives are met without any influence because you could say there isn't, but if it's coming from a different office, there's no guarantee.

86
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:17,853
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's important that

87
00:28:19,384 --> 00:28:22,346
[SPEAKER_04]: we follow through with this process from the first step to the end.

88
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:43,985
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would make the same recommendation that the council reviews all of the applications and then whatever set number that may be that we then send that over to the council president or the assigned or the chosen three council members that would then go through the process and then

89
00:28:44,902 --> 00:28:48,205
[SPEAKER_04]: bring us the final two for any any final decision.

90
00:28:48,285 --> 00:28:49,726
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, Mr. President.

91
00:28:50,547 --> 00:28:51,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor say.

92
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:54,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, President Bears.

93
00:28:54,249 --> 00:28:55,470
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for working on this.

94
00:28:56,111 --> 00:29:05,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Last week we spoke to the importance of, um, the council having say in the process, especially since the city clerk is partially responsible to the City Council.

95
00:29:05,858 --> 00:29:13,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, this person, whoever they may be, um, is one of our only employees, if not the only employee that we directly supervise.

96
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:20,847
[SPEAKER_02]: And this employee will be in charge of modernizing an office that requires a lot of work.

97
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:29,869
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been a consistent effort down there for a very long time, and I know residents are claiming for things to pick up as well.

98
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:37,091
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we will really need as a city council to have the fullest say that we can in this process.

99
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:48,338
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, that second option that Councilors Lazzaro and Scarpelli mentioned is the most inclusive way that we could move forward with this.

100
00:29:48,418 --> 00:30:06,412
[SPEAKER_02]: It gives all of us a chance to have a say in the process as well, because I know all of us as councilors are looking for different things, maybe a lot of similar things, but we are all, you know, we have our approaches to the office.

101
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,931
[SPEAKER_02]: one could say that we are independent thinkers in this process.

102
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:30,378
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of that, I think that the second path of all of us looking at resumes and recommending candidates is a path well trodden and a path that will best include all of our diverse opinions.

103
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng, Councilor Collins.

104
00:30:37,772 --> 00:30:38,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Bears.

105
00:30:38,572 --> 00:30:42,914
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate you working with Solicitor Foley on an approach to this.

106
00:30:42,934 --> 00:30:48,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that I would be comfortable with either of the approaches that you outlined.

107
00:30:49,017 --> 00:30:50,618
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I agree with my fellow councilors.

108
00:30:50,678 --> 00:30:58,642
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the bottom line for me is I think it's very important that this hiring process be run by the city council and not by the administration.

109
00:30:58,702 --> 00:31:05,245
[SPEAKER_07]: The city clerk is our employee, and I think it would be inappropriate for the hiring process to reflect otherwise.

110
00:31:07,706 --> 00:31:10,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have been happy with either approach, but I'm happy to agree with my Councilors.

111
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:16,351
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it will be relatively easy for us to all review the resumes.

112
00:31:16,391 --> 00:31:26,958
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad we'll all have a chance to weigh in, and I think it's a fair way to make sure that all of our preferences are accommodated, that we can each essentially have a say in who progresses to the interview round and take things from there.

113
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:27,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

114
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:32,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

115
00:31:32,201 --> 00:31:34,002
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you could talk for a bit, I'm trying to write this up.

116
00:31:35,416 --> 00:31:37,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, great, I'll stall here.

117
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:48,807
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just going to say that I am very comfortable with this, but that I do want to highlight that there are two parts here that I think might be being talked about.

118
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:58,035
[SPEAKER_12]: I assume people are talking about a group of three, so we each get the resumes, we each can look at them and make a recommendation individually and privately.

119
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:12,698
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it sounds like a group of three, Councilor Scarpelliralee is suggesting, I'm mentioning you only to ask and make sure that I'm not saying something that's incorrect, that a group of three would finalize the list of candidates to interview.

120
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,762
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there is also the initial interviews conducted by, and that has city council designee.

121
00:32:19,142 --> 00:32:25,906
[SPEAKER_12]: So just wanted to mention that as another point that I'm not sure if people are considering, but they're both of those,

122
00:32:26,566 --> 00:32:31,488
[SPEAKER_12]: finalizing the list as well as the conducting of the initial interviews.

123
00:32:32,088 --> 00:32:38,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, my interpretation was maybe we would take a vote tonight to designate three people who would then participate in those rounds.

124
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:41,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that sound right?

125
00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:42,772
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

126
00:32:42,992 --> 00:32:45,653
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm comfortable with that.

127
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:45,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

128
00:32:52,516 --> 00:32:52,756
All right.

129
00:33:01,948 --> 00:33:02,529
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you didn't.

130
00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:04,630
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone else have any thoughts here?

131
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,793
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, give me one second then.

132
00:33:08,873 --> 00:33:10,014
[SPEAKER_09]: My apologies to everybody.

133
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I just want to make sure I get this right.

134
00:33:44,723 --> 00:33:47,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone want to potentially put their name in as a designee?

135
00:33:48,024 --> 00:33:49,104
[SPEAKER_09]: We can talk about that a little bit.

136
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:50,404
[SPEAKER_09]: Is anyone interested?

137
00:33:51,825 --> 00:33:52,565
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll recognize you.

138
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:54,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazzaro.

139
00:33:55,986 --> 00:33:56,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I need to speak about it?

140
00:33:56,866 --> 00:33:58,566
[SPEAKER_01]: I am interested in interviewing.

141
00:33:58,766 --> 00:33:59,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

142
00:33:59,907 --> 00:34:00,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan.

143
00:34:02,318 --> 00:34:07,425
[SPEAKER_12]: I will, I'm willing, if no one else will do it, because I want to do my fair share of the work.

144
00:34:07,705 --> 00:34:08,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

145
00:34:08,687 --> 00:34:11,190
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone else interested in being a designee here.

146
00:34:13,433 --> 00:34:14,755
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm happy to do one as well.

147
00:34:14,975 --> 00:34:17,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Vice President Collins.

148
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:19,368
[SPEAKER_07]: My.

149
00:34:20,828 --> 00:34:32,994
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to offer to count myself out, seeing as I'm the one Councilor who is confirmed to probably not be working with the next city clerk but if there are not enough volunteers, I'm happy to serve on the interview committee.

150
00:34:35,027 --> 00:34:41,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, and I'm seeing no objections from Councilors saying Scarpelli or Leming as to wanting to be one of the designees.

151
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:43,329
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

152
00:34:44,609 --> 00:34:47,810
[SPEAKER_09]: So Council is our has nominated herself.

153
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:54,312
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan, and then I can do it or you can do a kid whatever you prefer.

154
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:56,192
Right.

155
00:34:59,133 --> 00:34:59,533
[SPEAKER_09]: I can do it.

156
00:34:59,733 --> 00:34:59,953
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

157
00:35:04,572 --> 00:35:15,257
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I will represent men as best as I can on this committee.

158
00:35:16,217 --> 00:35:17,498
[SPEAKER_09]: No guarantees, guys.

159
00:35:18,578 --> 00:35:21,820
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, so what I have here is,

160
00:35:23,202 --> 00:35:26,104
[SPEAKER_09]: An update to section three interview process.

161
00:35:26,164 --> 00:35:38,193
[SPEAKER_09]: So it would now read all applications will be sent to city Councilors for review and Councilors will submit the names of candidates they want to see interviewed to the director of HR to submit for the HR coordinator for scheduling of interviews.

162
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:42,396
[SPEAKER_09]: The city council will appoint three designees to participate in the interview process.

163
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:45,939
[SPEAKER_09]: All names of candidates selected for interview will be kept confidential.

164
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:51,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Initial interviews are conducted by city staff and city council designees.

165
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:59,830
[SPEAKER_09]: Specific questions and or scenario questions will be developed by the Director of HR and DEI Director for approval by the Council designees.

166
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,911
[SPEAKER_09]: All candidates for interviews will be asked the same standard questions.

167
00:36:05,351 --> 00:36:09,972
[SPEAKER_09]: The DEI Director will formulate basically a rubric with the questions prior to interviews.

168
00:36:10,812 --> 00:36:17,254
[SPEAKER_09]: Calendar invitation will be sent to all interviewers, which will include a copy of the rubric, questions, and the applications.

169
00:36:18,154 --> 00:36:22,235
[SPEAKER_09]: Following the interview process, all documentation will be collected and kept on file by HR.

170
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:28,273
[SPEAKER_09]: the HR coordinator will contact candidates selected for a second interview and schedule time for the second interview.

171
00:36:28,714 --> 00:36:34,377
[SPEAKER_09]: The second interviews will be conducted by, again, city staff and the city council designees.

172
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:42,363
[SPEAKER_09]: Specific questions prior to the second interview will be developed for approval in the same manner as the first process.

173
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:49,347
[SPEAKER_09]: So essentially if there are, like if we want to do, solve this problem type question.

174
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:50,808
[SPEAKER_09]: And then,

175
00:36:52,649 --> 00:36:57,032
[SPEAKER_09]: the top ranking three candidates will be submitted to the City Council for action.

176
00:36:57,712 --> 00:36:58,392
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan.

177
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:00,894
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

178
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:06,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Do I remember correctly that we mentioned last time that it could be different designees for the second round of interviews?

179
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:09,519
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't think we can this way.

180
00:37:09,579 --> 00:37:11,600
[SPEAKER_09]: I think like we could decide if

181
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,963
[SPEAKER_09]: One of us wants to be in the first round, two of us in the second round, or whatever combination of that we want to.

182
00:37:16,983 --> 00:37:19,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, so only these three people will be?

183
00:37:19,546 --> 00:37:21,967
[SPEAKER_09]: In the first, in these, yeah, exactly.

184
00:37:21,987 --> 00:37:25,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Because if we do more than that, then they're, yeah.

185
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:25,991
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks.

186
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:26,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

187
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have other questions, thoughts?

188
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:41,177
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, is there a motion to adopt the amended process for the interviews?

189
00:37:42,097 --> 00:37:44,278
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Callahan, seconded by?

190
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,699
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Vice President Collins.

191
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:47,960
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

192
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:49,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

193
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

194
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,702
[SPEAKER_09]: And is there a motion to approve the main paper on the motion of Councilor Tseng to approve?

195
00:37:56,162 --> 00:37:58,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

196
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:01,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Just gonna call the roll on this one.

197
00:38:01,644 --> 00:38:02,885
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

198
00:38:08,307 --> 00:38:10,809
[SPEAKER_09]: This is approving the whole thing as amended.

199
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:13,111
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

200
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan.

201
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:17,554
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Collins.

202
00:38:18,575 --> 00:38:21,017
[SPEAKER_05]: Council is our Councilor Lemon.

203
00:38:21,958 --> 00:38:22,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Council Scott belly.

204
00:38:23,979 --> 00:38:26,481
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng President beers.

205
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:29,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, 70 affirmative, none of the negative the motion passes.

206
00:38:31,968 --> 00:38:39,444
[SPEAKER_09]: 25152 offered by Council is our encounter limiting resolution to increase pedestrian safety at Boston Avenue and high street me one second here.

207
00:38:45,635 --> 00:38:56,325
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the city council received a letter dated September 28 2025 from Victoria burrows key age 10 that highlighted dangerous conditions for pedestrians at the intersection of Boston Avenue and high street and West Medford.

208
00:38:56,926 --> 00:39:02,291
[SPEAKER_09]: Now therefore be it resolved that the Metro City Council request an update on the payment marking plan for the high street corridor.

209
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:11,206
[SPEAKER_09]: from Boston Avenue to the West Medford High Street Rotary and any other potential traffic calming and safety measures available to increase the safety of pedestrians.

210
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:16,490
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved that the Medford City Council invite Traffic and Transportation Director Todd Blake to present said update.

211
00:39:17,851 --> 00:39:19,612
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazzaro.

212
00:39:21,554 --> 00:39:25,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, if I can offer Councilor Leming to read the letter.

213
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

214
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:35,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would like to thank my colleague, Councilor Lazzaro, for at least spearheading this.

215
00:39:35,826 --> 00:39:41,732
[SPEAKER_03]: On September 28th, Medford City Council received the following letter.

216
00:39:42,152 --> 00:39:51,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Dear Medford City Council, my name is Victoria and I'm 10 years old and I'm writing to you because I think there is a problem on Boston Avenue and High Street intersection.

217
00:39:51,967 --> 00:39:56,572
[SPEAKER_03]: I live right near that street and have to cross it every day with my sister on our walk to school.

218
00:39:56,612 --> 00:39:59,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Recently, my friend got hit by a car on that street.

219
00:40:00,035 --> 00:40:03,799
[SPEAKER_03]: He was fine, but it was still scary knowing that it happened.

220
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:09,164
[SPEAKER_03]: A few years ago, my dad and I walked around with a petition to fix this street and we got over 159 responses.

221
00:40:11,857 --> 00:40:15,919
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to know more, visit www.westmedford.us.

222
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:27,406
[SPEAKER_03]: I really hope you can address this problem as soon as possible so me and 159 other Medford citizens can get where they need to be safely, since Syria, Victoria, Borowski.

223
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:31,908
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm familiar with that intersection.

224
00:40:31,948 --> 00:40:40,813
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford has a number of very problematic intersections around town that we do need to improve that one, particularly if you're trying to get

225
00:40:41,788 --> 00:40:45,509
[SPEAKER_03]: through Boston Avenue and turn onto High Street.

226
00:40:45,649 --> 00:40:56,310
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very tricky, very risky, and it's sort of like the center point of a lot of roads coming into it.

227
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:06,892
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would appreciate any effort that can be done by the Traffic Commission and our transportation engineer to address this.

228
00:41:07,052 --> 00:41:10,973
[SPEAKER_03]: And once again, I'd like to thank my colleague for her efforts on this.

229
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:14,094
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

230
00:41:14,294 --> 00:41:15,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Lazzaro.

231
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:19,238
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

232
00:41:19,258 --> 00:41:34,451
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a few similar intersections in that neighborhood where the city has implemented some traffic calming measures that have received a variety of responses from neighbors, some positive, some negative.

233
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,354
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a similar intersection to this one.

234
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:47,951
[SPEAKER_01]: even closer to where I live, which is at the intersection of Placestead Road and Woburn Street, which is, it's a very wide intersection.

235
00:41:48,071 --> 00:41:53,973
[SPEAKER_01]: So the streets are very wide, though they're each, you know, one lane, but there's a lot of pavement around.

236
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:58,834
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that pavement means that cars have to kind of creep out in order to see

237
00:42:00,047 --> 00:42:03,350
[SPEAKER_01]: where they need to turn because they're at like a T stop.

238
00:42:04,491 --> 00:42:09,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a T stop like the train, like they're coming at the end of the road and they have to turn right or left.

239
00:42:10,175 --> 00:42:17,740
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to see the other cars coming or any pedestrians or bicycles, you have to like be in the middle of an intersection.

240
00:42:18,581 --> 00:42:21,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And the curbs don't go far enough out.

241
00:42:24,393 --> 00:42:34,236
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure why this is that way, but it ends up making the intersections pretty dangerous for cars, definitely dangerous for bikes, definitely dangerous for pedestrians.

242
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:37,997
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of these intersections do not have any crosswalks at all.

243
00:42:38,017 --> 00:42:50,581
[SPEAKER_01]: I live off of Woburn Street and when I go for jogs, I go down Woburn Street and I often cross this intersection where Todd Blake and his traffic department

244
00:42:51,473 --> 00:43:03,637
[SPEAKER_01]: have put new paintings and like plastic railings to redirect cars that there's short of a curb cut, which can be very expensive.

245
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:09,379
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to direct cars to pull forward so you can see better, but there still aren't any

246
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:19,340
[SPEAKER_01]: crosswalks because the crosswalks would not be able to be ADA compliant, because you would have to do curb cuts and the curb cuts are expensive.

247
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,282
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it ends up being a million dollars and taking a year as soon as you do curb cuts.

248
00:43:25,322 --> 00:43:35,185
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the meantime, you can put barriers made of plastic, you can put painting on the ground, and it does make it safer.

249
00:43:37,345 --> 00:43:41,049
[SPEAKER_01]: as an interim measure, and it's much less expensive.

250
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,673
[SPEAKER_01]: But sometimes neighbors think it's unsightly.

251
00:43:45,574 --> 00:43:49,218
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a tricky thing to navigate.

252
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:54,524
[SPEAKER_01]: The intersection that Victoria Borowski mentioned in the letter we all received last week.

253
00:43:55,265 --> 00:43:59,608
[SPEAKER_01]: She's 10 years old, she probably goes to the Brooks, she probably walks there from her neighborhood.

254
00:43:59,628 --> 00:44:03,592
[SPEAKER_01]: This intersection is also very wide, lots of pavement.

255
00:44:04,192 --> 00:44:09,757
[SPEAKER_01]: It does have a lot of crosswalks, but they're very wide crosswalks and cars will drive around curves to get

256
00:44:12,037 --> 00:44:13,658
[SPEAKER_01]: to get through the intersection.

257
00:44:14,498 --> 00:44:19,800
[SPEAKER_01]: I do wanna read a response that Todd sent me when I emailed him about this resolution.

258
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,662
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, we've implemented improvements at Boston and High Street on at least two separate occasions.

259
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:31,804
[SPEAKER_01]: As with other traffic calming initiatives, there have been mixed responses, especially from the aesthetics versus safety crowd.

260
00:44:32,284 --> 00:44:35,605
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you know, I fully support implementing several once again.

261
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:38,746
[SPEAKER_01]: This involves paint, delineator posts, et cetera.

262
00:44:38,766 --> 00:44:40,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Delineator posts are the plastic posts.

263
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:47,590
[SPEAKER_01]: There are in street warning signs that need to be repositioned, but they were still there as of yesterday.

264
00:44:47,931 --> 00:44:48,311
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true.

265
00:44:48,351 --> 00:44:54,880
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the ones that say like you have to stop for pedestrians and crosswalks, but they can get knocked around.

266
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:58,085
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're there and they do slow cars down, I believe.

267
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:06,626
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have a pavement marking plan for the High Street Corridor from Boston Ave to the West Medford High Street Rotary, which would tie into the new DCR markings.

268
00:45:06,846 --> 00:45:15,673
[SPEAKER_01]: There's new painting at the Rotary at the edge of Medford right before crossing into Arlington that was recently repainted.

269
00:45:17,834 --> 00:45:24,600
[SPEAKER_01]: This resolution, the intention was for it to be an encouragement of further

270
00:45:25,749 --> 00:45:42,640
[SPEAKER_01]: um, explanation and clarification and any other measures we can support for the traffic engineer and that department to keep, um, nudging along any extra safety measures we can do there because it is pretty dangerous.

271
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:47,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the road is both somehow too wide and too narrow.

272
00:45:47,182 --> 00:45:49,224
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how we've managed that.

273
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:49,684
[SPEAKER_01]: Um,

274
00:45:50,328 --> 00:45:58,578
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, I appreciate Victoria's letter and her reaching out to us and telling us about this situation.

275
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:02,103
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure if Todd was able to make it today.

276
00:46:02,203 --> 00:46:03,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not on the zoom right now.

277
00:46:03,184 --> 00:46:03,625
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not on.

278
00:46:04,085 --> 00:46:07,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't I think he had a conflict, but maybe we could I would

279
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:27,666
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe motion to refer this to our public works committee if we wanted to maybe have a meeting down the road and talk more about it and how we can offer support from the city council, though this is really, I mean, perhaps a budgetary issue and something just in the traffic engineers department.

00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:29,347

[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's it for now, so I'll recognize Jim.

318
00:49:35,376 --> 00:49:41,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, James Blatchford, City Hall, Room 102, Elections Commission.

319
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,741
[SPEAKER_13]: This is to present to you the call for election.

320
00:49:46,501 --> 00:49:56,746
[SPEAKER_13]: The only other important date that's not on there would be the deadline for voter registration, and that would be the day before early voting starts, that Friday, October 24th, until 5 p.m.

321
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:57,306
[SPEAKER_13]: in Room 102.

322
00:50:02,285 --> 00:50:03,685
[SPEAKER_09]: Great, do we have any questions?

323
00:50:03,725 --> 00:50:07,406
[SPEAKER_09]: We do, I will recognize Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Sagan.

324
00:50:07,566 --> 00:50:08,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you first, Mr. Blatt.

325
00:50:08,846 --> 00:50:09,526
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.

326
00:50:10,286 --> 00:50:16,307
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you've settled that office down and we're seeing so many great processes in place, so thank you.

327
00:50:17,368 --> 00:50:19,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Just one question that came up with the preliminaries.

328
00:50:19,848 --> 00:50:26,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Unfortunately, I think, I'm not sure if November 4th, the schools are open again during voting.

329
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is.

330
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:30,990
[SPEAKER_04]: So the only question I have is that

331
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:43,834
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the schools, I know I talked to the principal, she felt terrible, but they had a parent night that evening, and all we heard were people saying that I couldn't park, so I just went home.

332
00:50:45,366 --> 00:50:55,853
[SPEAKER_04]: So if there's a way that we coordinate with the principals to make sure or the superintendent that we clear any evening activities for election night, that would be super helpful.

333
00:50:55,873 --> 00:50:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I know during the day, there's plenty of time for people to go in and out.

334
00:50:59,695 --> 00:51:10,403
[SPEAKER_04]: There's plenty of parking at most locations, but I think it's important that when you run an event and you have 300 parents showing up plus voting, it made it very difficult and where people were just walking away from it.

335
00:51:10,443 --> 00:51:11,063
[SPEAKER_04]: We hate to see that.

336
00:51:11,483 --> 00:51:12,244
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you.

337
00:51:14,246 --> 00:51:21,094
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, I was not here when the schedule was set, nor was I here to negotiate with the school department.

338
00:51:23,008 --> 00:51:30,310
[SPEAKER_13]: I can assure you moving forward, that is definitely a conversation that my office will be having with both the school committee and the administration.

339
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:35,932
[SPEAKER_13]: But I can tell you right now, November 4th, there is no school.

340
00:51:36,672 --> 00:51:39,313
[SPEAKER_13]: So it is a professional development day within the school district.

341
00:51:39,353 --> 00:51:42,093
[SPEAKER_13]: So there won't be any conflict during the day.

342
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:44,814
[SPEAKER_13]: Specifically, there shouldn't be any conflict during the evening.

343
00:51:45,594 --> 00:51:47,695
[SPEAKER_13]: But looking forward to future elections,

344
00:51:48,595 --> 00:51:51,896
[SPEAKER_13]: the governor has signed a bill that actually sets the election date.

345
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:54,377
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it's September 1st for 2026.

346
00:51:54,777 --> 00:51:58,198
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and then the November election.

347
00:51:59,038 --> 00:52:04,640
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've already spoken with the superintendent and both of those days will have no school, at least for Children.

348
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,240
[SPEAKER_13]: There will be professional development days.

349
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:10,202
[SPEAKER_13]: But for next year, we've already spoken with the superintendent.

350
00:52:10,222 --> 00:52:11,022
[SPEAKER_13]: So that should be all set.

351
00:52:14,023 --> 00:52:15,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng

352
00:52:16,745 --> 00:52:18,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Manager Blatchford for all you do.

353
00:52:20,427 --> 00:52:26,330
[SPEAKER_02]: It's noticeable how much progress the Elections Office has made in the last few months especially, but last year.

354
00:52:27,991 --> 00:52:39,397
[SPEAKER_02]: I received some phone calls about folks who were, they were supposed to be able to vote, they weren't allowed to vote, but they had the, the word is slipping my mind.

355
00:52:39,517 --> 00:52:39,977
[SPEAKER_02]: Inactive.

356
00:52:40,297 --> 00:52:42,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, inactive status attached to them.

357
00:52:43,339 --> 00:52:43,579
[SPEAKER_02]: I know,

358
00:52:44,832 --> 00:52:52,296
[SPEAKER_02]: I've mostly squirted away with them but I was wondering if you could take this opportunity to speak to what happened there, what residents should know going forward.

359
00:52:52,696 --> 00:52:53,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

360
00:52:53,217 --> 00:53:02,982
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, first of all, the first thing if anyone has any questions about their status as a voter, particularly the inactive versus active status.

361
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:08,593
[SPEAKER_13]: As a voter, you get to vote on Election Day, no matter what.

362
00:53:09,234 --> 00:53:14,399
[SPEAKER_13]: So whether you are inactive or active, it just depends on how much paperwork you have to fill out on the day.

363
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,124
[SPEAKER_13]: But prior to Election Day, you can always check your status at the Secretary of State's website.

364
00:53:21,105 --> 00:53:23,567
[SPEAKER_13]: to see if you are an active voter versus an inactive voter.

365
00:53:23,607 --> 00:53:29,333
[SPEAKER_13]: If you are inactive for whatever reason, which could include not returning your census form.

366
00:53:29,353 --> 00:53:33,196
[SPEAKER_13]: I sent a piece of mail and it was returned to our office.

367
00:53:34,397 --> 00:53:39,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything that we cannot confirm your current residence would make you inactive.

368
00:53:39,662 --> 00:53:44,627
[SPEAKER_13]: So if for whatever reason anyone is inactive, they can always come into our office and

369
00:53:46,054 --> 00:53:48,535
[SPEAKER_13]: update their status, they can sign a census form in my office.

370
00:53:49,355 --> 00:53:53,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Additionally, you can re-register to vote almost.

371
00:53:54,057 --> 00:53:57,939
[SPEAKER_13]: You don't have to, but you can, and it would update your status.

372
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:04,961
[SPEAKER_13]: But the easiest thing would be come down to my office where we can email you your census in which case you can sign and send it back to us.

373
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:05,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

374
00:54:08,643 --> 00:54:08,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

375
00:54:08,983 --> 00:54:12,064
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have any further questions about the call for election?

376
00:54:14,556 --> 00:54:18,177
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

377

[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

387
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:30,299
Yes.

388
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:31,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng.

389
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:31,840
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

390
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,260
[SPEAKER_05]: President Bears.

391
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:33,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

392
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,481
[SPEAKER_09]: After the affirmative, none of the negative, the motion passes.

393
00:54:36,501 --> 00:54:40,902
[SPEAKER_09]: 25-154, submitted by the Elections Commission, Medford Election Warrant, November 2025.

394
00:54:42,552 --> 00:54:50,394
[SPEAKER_09]: This is functionally the exact same information, but per the law, we need to vote to approve this, and then we all need to sign it.

395
00:54:50,474 --> 00:54:52,834
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think I have the copy here for us to sign.

396
00:54:53,174 --> 00:54:54,375
[SPEAKER_09]: With a pen.

397
00:54:54,455 --> 00:54:54,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

398
00:54:55,175 --> 00:55:00,716
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm guessing that with this folder that says election warrant, that's probably what it is.

399
00:55:03,017 --> 00:55:04,557
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll just quickly summarize.

[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone either in person or on Zoom who would like to participate?

416
00:56:33,782 --> 00:56:35,003
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, we'll start at the podium.

417
00:56:35,063 --> 00:56:36,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not seeing any hands on Zoom.

418
00:56:36,423 --> 00:56:39,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me one second here.

419
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:50,490
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, name and address of the record.

420
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,310
[SPEAKER_06]: You have three minutes.

421
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:51,591
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

422
00:56:51,611 --> 00:56:52,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Micah Kesselman, 499 Main Street.

423
00:56:52,371 --> 00:56:53,151
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am here once again to

424
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:21,321
[SPEAKER_06]: bring forward to the public as much as possible, and I'll be here as long as it takes, at as many meetings as it takes, that right now we are in a crisis that is worsening every day when it comes to ICE and federal overreach into our city and community, and we're seeing people snatched up still.

425
00:57:22,502 --> 00:57:31,184
[SPEAKER_06]: And this council, for the most part, has been fairly active and engaged on this subject.

426
00:57:31,904 --> 00:57:32,484
[SPEAKER_06]: Nevertheless,

427
00:57:34,167 --> 00:57:37,149
[SPEAKER_06]: this council is limited in power and authority and what it can do.

428
00:57:38,149 --> 00:57:50,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is the other half of that power and authority that can do more is and continues to be, and for the foreseeable future will always be the mayor and the MPD, the cops.

429
00:57:51,496 --> 00:57:57,660
[SPEAKER_06]: And neither of them have done a single goddamn thing to protect.

430
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,480
[SPEAKER_06]: No swearing.

431
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Our community.

432
00:57:59,721 --> 00:58:00,421
[SPEAKER_06]: We gotta avoid that.

433
00:58:03,671 --> 00:58:07,294
[SPEAKER_06]: this continuing illegal activity and federal overreach.

434
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:19,185
[SPEAKER_06]: The mayor has not even made it a twinkle in her eye, given any attention whatsoever that it merits, and it needs to be the top of her priority list.

435
00:58:21,067 --> 00:58:28,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I will point out that in the last two weeks alone, two people have been shot in Chicago, and

436
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:46,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Video recording directly contradicts everything DHS has said about it and shows that they were attacked without cause effectively by ICE and DHS agents.

437
00:58:47,318 --> 00:58:48,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Two people were shot.

438
00:58:50,621 --> 00:58:56,487
[SPEAKER_06]: City Councilors have been, or the equivalent aldermen, have been arrested for demanding warrant

439
00:58:57,135 --> 00:59:05,480
[SPEAKER_06]: judicial order or articulable probable cause when agents are doing their abductions.

440
00:59:07,622 --> 00:59:11,924
[SPEAKER_06]: An entire building has been raided like it was a military compound.

441
00:59:12,545 --> 00:59:19,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Children frog marched out into the night into vans in their underwear and zip tied.

442
00:59:20,370 --> 00:59:23,992
[SPEAKER_06]: No warrants or orders were presented when that happened.

443
00:59:25,317 --> 00:59:27,518
[SPEAKER_06]: This is getting worse every day.

444
00:59:28,138 --> 00:59:37,422
[SPEAKER_06]: In Massachusetts, in Lemonster, units were using a child to lure a father out of a house.

445
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:42,084
[SPEAKER_06]: They were effectively conducting, they were conducting a crime, not effectively.

446
00:59:42,124 --> 00:59:45,185
[SPEAKER_06]: That was, out and out, that was a criminal act.

447
00:59:45,625 --> 00:59:46,325
[SPEAKER_06]: That was illegal.

448
00:59:46,345 --> 00:59:52,748
[SPEAKER_06]: We can enforce laws against lawbreakers.

449
00:59:53,785 --> 01:00:00,749
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because you have a badge doesn't give you a right to commit crimes that are clearly crimes.

450
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:08,594
[SPEAKER_06]: The cops can do something and they have to draw a line and they have to say what side they're on eventually because it's really coming to that.

451
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:14,217
[SPEAKER_06]: It's ridiculous that they haven't even tried to protect the community that they're supposed to.

452
01:00:15,222 --> 01:00:26,865
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm one of very few people remaining who still have patience and tolerance that expect and ask the cops to actually work on behalf of the safety and security of the community.

453
01:00:27,983 --> 01:00:35,265
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they want to have a relationship with this city that they supposedly work for, they can start doing their job.

454
01:00:36,285 --> 01:00:37,686
[SPEAKER_06]: That also goes for the mayor.

455
01:00:38,306 --> 01:00:52,870
[SPEAKER_06]: I will mention, and then I will end this long rant, that in Chicago, one thing that has happened recently was that the mayor of Chicago recently put into effect ice-free zones where, you can look into it, but effectively,

456
01:00:53,933 --> 01:01:06,257
[SPEAKER_06]: people who live there and businesses that live there can put up signage that makes it an area that they're presumptively disallowed from entering without warrant.

457
01:01:08,558 --> 01:01:21,523
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not going to call for the arrest of any agents violating this ice-free zone, but they will use this as a grounds for suing the federal government for illegal activity, basically.

458
01:01:22,413 --> 01:01:28,235
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is something, this is a milk toast bare minimum thing that we could do in this city too.

459
01:01:28,996 --> 01:01:34,278
[SPEAKER_06]: And if more cities went about this is every city that's being impacted did this same thing.

460
01:01:35,584 --> 01:01:41,148
[SPEAKER_06]: it wouldn't fix it, but at least it would be the kind of lawfare that could be effective.

461
01:01:41,428 --> 01:01:43,150
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'll leave it at that.

462
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:51,516
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will be here again next session and the session after that saying the same freaking things until we see something come from the administration on this.

463
01:01:51,856 --> 01:01:52,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

464
01:01:52,397 --> 01:01:52,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

465
01:01:52,837 --> 01:01:59,002
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, seeing no hands on Zoom, we'll stay at the podium.

466
01:01:59,022 --> 01:02:03,625
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm gonna address the record and you'll have about three minutes.

467
01:02:04,063 --> 01:02:05,684
[SPEAKER_00]: Mary Anna Ducey, 2 North Street.

468
01:02:06,564 --> 01:02:20,769
[SPEAKER_00]: I was here last week at your meeting and I had asked that you people consider going back to the weekly city council meetings, primarily because the meetings get to be too long, too many people want to speak.

469
01:02:21,590 --> 01:02:25,751
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to use the August 5th meeting that didn't end until 1.25 in the morning.

470
01:02:27,972 --> 01:02:33,076
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was quite surprised that you were having a meeting tonight because you just had one last week.

471
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:35,618
[SPEAKER_00]: So this was an unscheduled one apparently.

472
01:02:36,659 --> 01:02:45,345
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to know if you people have discussed it, the possibility of going back to the weekly session because I asked last week that you think about this.

473
01:02:45,806 --> 01:02:48,508
[SPEAKER_00]: And the voters and I want to know if you're going to consider that.

474
01:02:50,987 --> 01:02:52,949
[SPEAKER_09]: We haven't had a vote to change the rules.

475
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:59,336
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we do meet every week, we meet in committees on a weekly basis and we have regular meetings every two weeks.

476
01:03:00,857 --> 01:03:06,843
[SPEAKER_09]: We are having back to back meetings because we rescheduled our September 23rd meeting because it was Rosh Hashanah.

477
01:03:07,964 --> 01:03:14,150
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have again, at the end of the month, back to back meetings also because of a holiday rescheduling.

478
01:03:14,708 --> 01:03:18,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so are you possibly gonna consider going back to weekly?

479
01:03:18,451 --> 01:03:22,253
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know you haven't discussed it, but are you going to consider it?

480
01:03:24,015 --> 01:03:32,541
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't speak for anyone else, but Councilors could put on a request to change the rules if they wanted to go back or change to a regular weekly meeting.

481
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:43,348
[SPEAKER_09]: But I will just note, we've met more since the shift to the committee structure, and those meetings tend to be shorter, focused on one or two topics.

482
01:03:43,468 --> 01:03:44,169
[SPEAKER_09]: They are happening.

483
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:55,607
[SPEAKER_09]: every week we're meeting, you know, at least the first 18 months of this term, we were meeting, you know, three or four times a week, you know, two to four times a week.

484
01:03:55,627 --> 01:03:58,069
[SPEAKER_09]: We had more meetings this term than we did in the previous term.

485
01:03:58,109 --> 01:04:00,130
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's not that we aren't meeting weekly.

486
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:00,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

487
01:04:00,971 --> 01:04:01,431
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

488
01:04:01,451 --> 01:04:09,597
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand your meeting committee, but you don't have the formal council meetings, you know, every other week is scheduled unless you have to make up for a meeting.

489
01:04:10,057 --> 01:04:10,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

490
01:04:10,737 --> 01:04:14,100
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but I know voters,

491
01:04:15,512 --> 01:04:18,514
[SPEAKER_00]: and other residents would like you to go back to the weekly.

492
01:04:18,534 --> 01:04:27,199
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like you to strongly consider doing that, especially if the referendum question passes and you get 11 city councilors.

493
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:32,923
[SPEAKER_00]: That means everybody's gonna need an opportunity to speak, which will lengthen the meetings.

494
01:04:33,624 --> 01:04:39,968
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you should really consider this going forward, especially if you get 11 people on the council.

495
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:41,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

496
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:46,720
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, I see Ellen on Zoom.

497
01:04:48,542 --> 01:04:50,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Ellen, one second, I'll unmute you.

498
01:04:50,624 --> 01:04:55,489
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be able to start your video when I unmute you if you want, and you'll have three minutes.

499
01:04:56,250 --> 01:04:57,511
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

500
01:05:01,408 --> 01:05:03,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Ellen, we can't hear you, give me one second.

501
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:05,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I think I'm good now.

502
01:05:06,112 --> 01:05:16,139
[SPEAKER_08]: Ellen Epstein, I live on Grove Street, and I just have a quick question, a procedural question, which is, can you give me some examples of

503
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:19,801
[SPEAKER_08]: why you go into executive session.

504
01:05:19,821 --> 01:05:30,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard one mentioned earlier, like if you're talking about hiring or looking at resumes, that kind of confidentiality.

505
01:05:30,046 --> 01:05:33,407
[SPEAKER_08]: But what are some other reasons you might go into executive session?

506
01:05:34,368 --> 01:05:34,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

507
01:05:35,773 --> 01:05:37,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, happy to tell you.

508
01:05:38,414 --> 01:05:42,737
[SPEAKER_09]: There are a few reasons that a council can go into executive session under the open meeting law.

509
01:05:44,958 --> 01:05:52,422
[SPEAKER_09]: One is to discuss reputation, character, physical condition, or mental health of an individual, or to discuss discipline dismissal.

510
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:53,903
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the first one, that section.

511
01:05:53,923 --> 01:05:56,264
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Mass General Law, Chapter 30A, Section 21A.

512
01:06:01,007 --> 01:06:11,375
[SPEAKER_09]: The next one is to conduct strategy sessions in preparation for negotiations with non-union personnel or to conduct collective bargaining sessions or contract negotiations.

513
01:06:12,296 --> 01:06:20,543
[SPEAKER_09]: The third one is to discuss strategy with respect to collective bargaining or litigation if an open meeting may have detrimental effect on bargaining or litigating position.

514
01:06:21,563 --> 01:06:26,948
[SPEAKER_09]: The fourth is to discuss the deployment of security personnel or devices or strategies with respect thereto.

515
01:06:28,092 --> 01:06:32,653
[SPEAKER_09]: The fifth is to investigate charges of criminal misconduct or to consider the filing of criminal complaints.

516
01:06:33,793 --> 01:06:42,395
[SPEAKER_09]: Six is to consider the purchase, exchange, lease, or value of real property if the chair declares that an open meeting may have a detrimental effect on the negotiating position of the public body.

517
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:49,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Seven is to comply with or act under the authority of any general or special law or federal grant and aid requirements.

518
01:06:51,318 --> 01:07:01,471
[SPEAKER_09]: Eight is to consider interview applicants for employment or appointment by a preliminary screening committee, if the chair declares that an open meeting will have detrimental effect in obtaining qualified applicants.

519
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:10,245
[SPEAKER_09]: provided that this will not apply to any meeting, including meetings of a preliminary screening committee to consider and interview advocates who have passed a prior preliminary screening.

520
01:07:10,385 --> 01:07:11,787
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the one we were talking about earlier.

521
01:07:11,807 --> 01:07:25,000
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the last one is to meet or confer with a mediator as defined in section 21, 23C of chapter 233, with respect to litigation or decision on any public business within its jurisdictions involving another party group or entity.

522
01:07:25,961 --> 01:07:27,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there's one more, sorry.

523
01:07:27,782 --> 01:07:42,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Ten is to discuss trade secrets or confidential competitively sensitive or other proprietary information provided in the course of activities conducted by a governmental body as an energy supplier under a license granted by the Department of Public Utilities.

524
01:07:42,517 --> 01:07:47,381
[SPEAKER_09]: So that wouldn't be us, but actually it might be.

525
01:07:48,122 --> 01:07:48,983
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a long paragraph.

526
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:55,217
[SPEAKER_09]: It might apply when a municipal aggregator determines that such disclosure will adversely affect its ability to conduct business.

527
01:07:55,257 --> 01:07:56,958
[SPEAKER_09]: We do municipal energy aggregation.

528
01:07:57,038 --> 01:08:04,663
[SPEAKER_09]: So potentially, if we ever had to meet to discuss a new energy aggregation contract, but those are the 10 exemptions.

529
01:08:04,823 --> 01:08:10,707
[SPEAKER_09]: And then there are some other, I've timed myself off.

530
01:08:11,448 --> 01:08:14,691
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some other requirements.

531
01:08:14,711 --> 01:08:16,313
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to convene in an open session.

532
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:20,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Majority of members have to vote to go into executive session with a roll call vote.

533
01:08:20,937 --> 01:08:27,524
[SPEAKER_09]: And the chair has to state which of those 10 reasons the body is entering executive session.

534
01:08:28,985 --> 01:08:30,086
[SPEAKER_08]: But not to the public.

535
01:08:30,146 --> 01:08:31,648
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't state it to the public.

536
01:08:32,404 --> 01:08:35,526
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you have to state which of the purposes, but not like the specifics.

537
01:08:35,566 --> 01:08:44,252
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to say we're entering it under purpose six to discuss purchase, exchange, lease, and value of real property.

538
01:08:44,652 --> 01:08:47,454
[SPEAKER_09]: But we don't have to say it's for this property for this reason.

539
01:08:47,794 --> 01:08:47,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

540
01:08:48,274 --> 01:08:48,555
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

541
01:08:48,815 --> 01:08:49,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

542
01:08:51,116 --> 01:08:51,316
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

543
01:08:51,576 --> 01:08:51,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

544
01:08:51,977 --> 01:08:57,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone else who'd like to participate in public participation?

545
01:08:58,181 --> 01:08:59,702
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing one in the chamber.

546
01:09:00,653 --> 01:09:02,134
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll go to the podium.

547
01:09:02,554 --> 01:09:05,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

548
01:09:05,416 --> 01:09:06,757
[SPEAKER_09]: And you'll have three minutes.

549
01:09:07,598 --> 01:09:11,600
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Bears, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushman Street, East Medford.

550
01:09:12,301 --> 01:09:16,404
[SPEAKER_10]: Before I start, this is the second time this happened to me.

551
01:09:16,424 --> 01:09:18,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm having problems getting on the Zoom.

552
01:09:19,346 --> 01:09:22,027
[SPEAKER_10]: Out of 10 years, this is the second time I've had problems.

553
01:09:22,107 --> 01:09:25,069
[SPEAKER_10]: It says to enter the meeting passcode.

554
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:26,911
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see it on the agenda.

555
01:09:27,931 --> 01:09:29,172
[SPEAKER_10]: Which link did you use?

556
01:09:29,653 --> 01:09:29,953
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry?

557
01:09:31,174 --> 01:09:32,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, where are you seeing the link?

558
01:09:34,116 --> 01:09:36,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Or like, what did you click to get to that screen on your screen?

559
01:09:36,497 --> 01:09:42,520
[SPEAKER_10]: I did everything that I've done for 10 years, but now it says they want a meeting passcode.

560
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:43,100
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

561
01:09:43,161 --> 01:09:46,262
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not on this agenda as far as I can tell.

562
01:09:48,203 --> 01:09:51,405
[SPEAKER_10]: But you're having people on Zoom, they got through okay, correct?

563
01:09:51,425 --> 01:09:52,165
[SPEAKER_09]: They did, yeah.

564
01:09:52,545 --> 01:09:53,186
[SPEAKER_10]: More than one?

565
01:09:53,206 --> 01:09:57,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, there's at least, there's been like seven or eight tonight.

566
01:09:57,128 --> 01:09:59,369
[SPEAKER_10]: So you know what the passcode is?

567
01:10:00,378 --> 01:10:03,240
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it is 479095.

568
01:10:03,460 --> 01:10:05,041
[SPEAKER_09]: It's at the end of the call-in number.

569
01:10:05,161 --> 01:10:06,641
[SPEAKER_10]: With a number sign at the end?

570
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:10,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so yeah, so the six numbers before the pound sign.

571
01:10:11,203 --> 01:10:15,626
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'll try that later on and I'll put the number sign in this time.

572
01:10:16,106 --> 01:10:16,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

573
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:17,006
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

574
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:17,507
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

575
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:19,788
[SPEAKER_09]: And yeah, we'll see if we can update that.

576
01:10:21,831 --> 01:10:32,498
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go to our agenda website, the MedfordMA.CivicClerk, and I think if you go to the city events calendar, when you click the link, the password is already a part of it.

577
01:10:34,059 --> 01:10:40,283
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're entering just, if you're typing in this URL, then it might need another passcode.

578
01:10:40,303 --> 01:10:43,945
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll double check on that, but I think it might be an issue of how the link is getting posted.

579
01:10:44,545 --> 01:10:44,925
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

580
01:10:44,945 --> 01:10:45,566
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

581
01:10:45,946 --> 01:10:46,947
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate your help.

582
01:10:47,427 --> 01:10:47,827
[SPEAKER_09]: You got it.

583
01:10:54,596 --> 01:10:55,357
[SPEAKER_10]: I have three minutes.

584
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:58,318
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to restart your time because we're talking about pass codes.

585
01:10:58,619 --> 01:10:58,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

586
01:11:05,503 --> 01:11:05,783
[SPEAKER_10]: You're good.

587
01:11:05,823 --> 01:11:14,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes your city councilors talk on world issues at the same time versus fixing up newest pothole in town.

588
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:19,853
[SPEAKER_10]: So now I am, I am talking world issue.

589
01:11:21,133 --> 01:11:23,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Today is two year anniversary.

590
01:11:25,217 --> 01:11:33,999
[SPEAKER_10]: October 7th, 2023, the slaughter of 1,200 Jews and non-Jews at a music festival.

591
01:11:34,379 --> 01:11:35,519
[SPEAKER_10]: They took hostages.

592
01:11:36,539 --> 01:11:47,081
[SPEAKER_10]: It seemed horrible as far as on the newscast, but I'm not here to blame because I wasn't there and I don't know who these characters are.

593
01:11:47,101 --> 01:11:52,262
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not placing blame, but I feel horrible for them and the families.

594
01:11:55,116 --> 01:11:57,757
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'd like to please hear my prayer.

595
01:12:00,237 --> 01:12:16,081
[SPEAKER_10]: Almighty God, creator of heaven, earth, all sentient beings, and more, please get me and all of us to be and do the best that we can, now, always, forever, and ever, in our quest for eternal, blissful peace.

596
01:12:16,921 --> 01:12:17,181
[SPEAKER_10]: Amen.

597
01:12:19,322 --> 01:12:24,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I don't have the authority to ask for a moment of silence, so I'm gonna end by saying

598
01:12:24,897 --> 01:12:38,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Lastly, my Christmas wish this year is the Mideast has an everlasting peace for the first time in the last two, maybe 3,000 years, period.

599
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:39,521
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your time.

600
01:12:42,762 --> 01:12:43,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

601
01:12:43,323 --> 01:12:50,925
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there anyone either in person or on Zoom who would like to speak during public participation?

602
01:12:54,594 --> 01:12:56,637
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, I'm gonna close public participation.

603
01:12:56,657 --> 01:12:59,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any motions on the floor?

604
01:13:01,022 --> 01:13:04,487
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion to adjourn by Councilor Lazzaro, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

605
01:13:04,507 --> 01:13:05,628
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

606
01:13:06,469 --> 01:13:06,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

607
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:08,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes, meeting is adjourned.
