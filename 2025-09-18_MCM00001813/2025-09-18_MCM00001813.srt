1
00:00:00,371 --> 00:00:00,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

2
00:00:01,072 --> 00:00:05,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome to the City Metro Conservation Commission meeting, Wednesday, September 17th.

3
00:00:06,455 --> 00:00:23,024
[SPEAKER_08]: We have two items on the agenda, and we're going to take... I know the agenda lists one before the other, but just Mr. Long-Berman is actually a cop a world away, and he requested to just sort of do his before at the start.

4
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:24,365
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to take that one first.

5
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:25,326
[SPEAKER_08]: So apologies, Don.

6
00:00:25,606 --> 00:00:26,667
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll just take your second.

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:31,771
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get both of you on here, so just wanted to launch it.

8
00:00:31,791 --> 00:00:35,832
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first order is a notice of intent for 171 Arlington Street.

9
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:38,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Alexander Wong-Berman has filed an amended notice of intent.

10
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:40,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Not amended, not amended.

11
00:00:44,254 --> 00:00:44,474
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

12
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:45,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Abbreviated.

13
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:45,834
[SPEAKER_08]: Abbreviated.

14
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:47,395
[SPEAKER_08]: My head.

15
00:00:47,655 --> 00:00:49,155
[SPEAKER_08]: So abbreviated notice of intent.

16
00:00:50,575 --> 00:00:59,241
[SPEAKER_08]: to construct an addition to the rear of the house and add a deck at 171 Arlington Street within the 200-foot Riverfront area, bordering on a subject to flooding and 100-foot buffer zone to the top of Bank and Bedford Bass.

17
00:01:06,606 --> 00:01:06,826
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

18
00:01:08,107 --> 00:01:08,788
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Dennis.

19
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:14,032
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks for joining us, Mr. Berman.

20
00:01:16,453 --> 00:01:18,675
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to briefly describe your project to us?

21
00:01:20,467 --> 00:01:25,069
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so this is related to our proposed addition in the rear of the property.

22
00:01:25,149 --> 00:01:38,115
[SPEAKER_00]: The addition goes out into the backyard towards the Mystic River and is in the riverfront area and as such requires the abbreviated notice of intent.

23
00:01:39,035 --> 00:01:52,846
[SPEAKER_00]: The work will be conducted per the drawings and per the specifications of our engineer involving the construction of a stormwater system behind the property addition.

24
00:01:53,847 --> 00:02:01,153
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the work will be in accordance with the soil erosion control plan with mitigative measures put in place.

25
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:07,638
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there are any further details, please feel free to let me know.

26
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:09,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

27
00:02:15,179 --> 00:02:17,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, could you pull up the plan?

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:25,385
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want the resource area plan or the construction plans?

29
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Construction plans.

30
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:39,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

31
00:02:39,988 --> 00:02:41,530
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to have to make that bigger.

32
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

33
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:44,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

34
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:45,293
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

35
00:02:45,314 --> 00:02:52,400
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Dennis, I think, sorry, I think you might have a slightly outdated 1. sorry.

36
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:53,301
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

37
00:02:53,501 --> 00:03:01,229
[SPEAKER_00]: So the, they actually redesigned it such that the infiltration chambers are side by side to minimize the.

38
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:04,052
[SPEAKER_00]: The impact towards the river zone.

39
00:03:07,279 --> 00:03:09,761
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if I'm able to pull it up.

40
00:03:10,042 --> 00:03:16,087
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem is I cannot access Google over here because of the firewall.

41
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:18,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.

42
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:23,294
[SPEAKER_00]: We might have a version on the computer here.

43
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:24,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Just check.

44
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:27,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, was the email that you sent recently the most recent version?

45
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:28,899
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the one I thought I had.

46
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,922
[SPEAKER_00]: So just... You know, Dennis, I can try and get them to...

47
00:03:34,994 --> 00:03:38,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, yeah, I'll stop share and let you jump in.

48
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:43,110
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have to do is maybe email you the most recent one here.

49
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:45,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Here.

50
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,001
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I should have just sent that over your way, Dennis.

51
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:42,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Sometimes, if there's a PDF involved, it sometimes takes a little bit.

52
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:53,009
[SPEAKER_00]: And apologies for that.

53
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,853
[SPEAKER_00]: See if I can beat you to it too.

54
00:05:29,077 --> 00:05:29,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Here we go.

55
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:30,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Nope, that's got it.

56
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:34,090
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect, thank you.

57
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:07,875
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the correct answer.

58
00:06:14,437 --> 00:06:17,218
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis, could you just read the date of these plans?

59
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:17,758
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

60
00:06:17,798 --> 00:06:20,239
[SPEAKER_08]: These are 5-20, which is later than the other ones you had.

61
00:06:20,299 --> 00:06:20,939
[SPEAKER_08]: So apologies.

62
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,259
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys got the early ones, I think.

63
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I think when I just sent it from the... I had both of them in my drive, but I think I might have just sent them over to my pub.

64
00:06:28,301 --> 00:06:31,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry about that.

65
00:06:31,502 --> 00:06:36,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a quick clarifying question between the plans that I think the commission had before and this one.

66
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:41,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, did the trees.

67
00:06:41,538 --> 00:06:47,908
[SPEAKER_02]: We went from having 1 tree in the back of the property to having to kind of running through the center of the yard.

68
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:56,284
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a, yeah, the trees might be slightly inaccurate.

69
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:57,705
[SPEAKER_00]: I mentioned that to my engineer.

70
00:06:57,985 --> 00:06:59,046
[SPEAKER_00]: We can move them if needed.

71
00:06:59,106 --> 00:07:01,188
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that he would just leave them there.

72
00:07:01,428 --> 00:07:04,070
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we needed to move them, he could move them.

73
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:11,316
[SPEAKER_00]: But that tree that you see closest to the infiltration chambers is actually directly along the fence line on the right-hand side of the drawing there.

74
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:16,621
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, because I think that the version that Dennis had before, the trees are different.

75
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:18,462
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I ask is because that

76
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:37,017
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, setback from that excavation area, those trees is going to impact, you know, those trees health and between the placement shown here and the placement that you had in the previous design set, I think the impacts come off very differently.

77
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:40,179
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think getting some clarification on where those trees actually are would be huge.

78
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:48,174
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can send the message to our engineer to have them relocate the trees to the accurate location.

79
00:07:48,194 --> 00:07:53,697
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also mention I've spoken to a licensed arborist and we're putting in place mitigative measures.

80
00:07:53,777 --> 00:07:56,658
[SPEAKER_00]: They mentioned that the greatest impact would be from soil compaction.

81
00:07:56,758 --> 00:08:09,225
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've had a bunch of wood chips actually dumped over in our backyard and intend to spread that over the area where the excavators will be operating and putting plywood on top of that to minimize soil compaction.

82
00:08:11,212 --> 00:08:27,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Greg, if I may build on your comments, I would ask and encourage that the location of the chambers really be considered and adjusted to accommodate preserving those existing trees.

83
00:08:27,944 --> 00:08:32,387
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is important that we get the tree locations accurately marked in the plan.

84
00:08:32,768 --> 00:08:39,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And from my perspective, preserving and the health of those trees is probably

85
00:08:41,431 --> 00:08:45,895
[SPEAKER_03]: more impactful than making an adjustment a few feet away from the river.

86
00:08:46,996 --> 00:08:51,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's suggested that we prioritize that in the updated design.

87
00:08:52,983 --> 00:08:56,967
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good to hear about the wood chips and the plywood.

88
00:08:57,267 --> 00:09:01,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I would also suggest some trunk protection around those trees.

89
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:17,529
[SPEAKER_03]: and even consider a fence that keeps vehicles and traffic and equipment some distance away from the base of the tree to avoid compaction on the most critical root zone around the tree.

90
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good point, Jeremy.

91
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we've already constructed fences as a barrier around both of those trees.

92
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any details or images of that that you can provide us?

93
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:40,670
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than what I have on my phone here, I can provide what I show.

94
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:41,811
[SPEAKER_00]: One second.

95
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:54,862
[SPEAKER_00]: I would note that moving the infiltration chambers back towards the house accomplishes the same to the trees as it does to the river since the trees are both located in the direction of the river.

96
00:09:56,828 --> 00:10:01,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that may be the case based on what I saw in the previous plan in this plan.

97
00:10:01,692 --> 00:10:07,857
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like the chamber got closer to the tree on the right side of the plan here, but we'll look for that.

98
00:10:08,597 --> 00:10:10,378
[SPEAKER_03]: There's updates in the tree locations.

99
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:11,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

100
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and this is just an example of the fencing constructed as a barrier.

101
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:22,165
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how visible it is through the phone or through the computer camera here.

102
00:10:22,885 --> 00:10:23,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

103
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:24,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I can see it.

104
00:10:24,747 --> 00:10:25,067
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

105
00:10:25,327 --> 00:10:25,988
[SPEAKER_00]: That is helpful.

106
00:10:26,008 --> 00:10:26,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.

107
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:27,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

108
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:35,256
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for reference, where you see that circle in the grass, that dead circle, that's actually approximately the location of where the chambers will be.

109
00:10:35,276 --> 00:10:42,603
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question regarding the 100-year floodplain.

110
00:10:43,627 --> 00:10:48,811
[SPEAKER_05]: The abbreviated notice said that the project is within the floodplain.

111
00:10:50,052 --> 00:11:05,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I just wanted to verify that because on the adjacent lot, Mr. Foote thought the 100-year floodplain was surveyed at elevation 6.7.

112
00:11:09,665 --> 00:11:12,527
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't imagine it would be a whole lot different on the adjacent lot.

113
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:17,100
[SPEAKER_05]: What does the commission think about that?

114
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:37,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, looking at the elevations, it doesn't appear that there's significant

115
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:39,889
[SPEAKER_02]: changes to grade.

116
00:11:41,489 --> 00:11:54,174
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as grade is roughly the same pre to post, it appears the deck is beyond the seven-foot contour, or sorry, the addition is beyond seven-foot contour, so there's no loss in flood storage.

117
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:58,495
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't concern me a huge amount.

118
00:12:00,456 --> 00:12:00,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Craig.

119
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:05,698
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I was thinking as well, noting that the seven-foot contour is

120
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:08,619
[SPEAKER_05]: The deck is located at the 7 foot contour.

121
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:10,439
[SPEAKER_05]: The deck is on pilings.

122
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,621
[SPEAKER_05]: And the addition appears to be outside of the platform.

123
00:12:23,904 --> 00:12:26,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other comments or questions from the commission?

124
00:12:27,265 --> 00:12:33,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have one comment on the O&M plan that was provided.

125
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:47,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be beneficial to both the project as it gets constructed in long-term O&M if the plan was split into documents for construction phase and long-term phase.

126
00:12:47,862 --> 00:12:52,105
[SPEAKER_02]: That way you have a very clear cut and dry document once everything's said and done.

127
00:12:52,125 --> 00:13:00,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say you were to sell the house to somebody else, they wouldn't have to puzzle over what portions of that plan they're responsible for implementing and which ones are not.

128
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:12,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a clear plan that describes what needs to be done during construction phase that can basically then get scrapped once you're done, you end up with one plan that you carry with you with the property.

129
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:14,446
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only other comment that I have.

130
00:13:22,375 --> 00:13:33,238
[SPEAKER_01]: On that topic for the O&M plan, I was just curious if, Mr. Berman, if you drafted that or someone else did.

131
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, my engineer drafted the O&M plan.

132
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,340
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

133
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Contracted with an environmental engineer.

134
00:13:43,341 --> 00:13:43,621
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

135
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:46,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

136
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:52,894
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another question unrelated to that.

137
00:13:54,175 --> 00:13:59,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't see, we may be missing your signature just on the form.

138
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:01,420
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis, do we have one?

139
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,740
[SPEAKER_08]: We have it now.

140
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,963
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it was included in the one that I got sent to you guys, but it's there now.

141
00:14:08,184 --> 00:14:09,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

142
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:10,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

143
00:14:13,567 --> 00:14:15,128
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to confirm

144
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there, there is no tree removal.

145
00:14:20,022 --> 00:14:24,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any vegetation besides grass that's being disturbed?

146
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:41,474
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are some ornamental pieces of vegetation along the left side of the property there that are being removed in addition to our raised garden bed, which the garden bed's already been removed.

147
00:14:41,494 --> 00:14:46,537
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's some butterfly bush plants that will be removed over there.

148
00:14:48,827 --> 00:14:50,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

149
00:14:50,469 --> 00:14:52,290
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of catmint plants.

150
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:58,635
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any plan to replant anything once the chambers are in?

151
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:10,365
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any solid plan, anything that's been drawn out, but we do plan to work with a landscaper to add some additional vegetation.

152
00:15:11,406 --> 00:15:16,410
[SPEAKER_00]: Part of this plan is to reseed the grass, I believe, as specified there.

153
00:15:17,132 --> 00:15:38,584
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I'd certainly be interested if you're willing to commit to something or discuss with the commission whether it needs to be a condition, but would be happy to see some native vegetation going in to support the wildlife to further filter the water.

154
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:43,227
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you have any thoughts on that, I'm happy to hear them.

155
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:44,719
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

156
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,664
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my initial thought is that if it is a requirement, we can certainly do so.

157
00:15:48,744 --> 00:16:00,437
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not a requirement, we prefer to have the work done and to sort of look it over with our landscaper and make a decision afterwards based on what the end result looks like.

158
00:16:01,895 --> 00:16:05,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we can discuss that amongst the commission members.

159
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:10,839
[SPEAKER_01]: I think maybe the only other item, Dennis, I don't know.

160
00:16:10,939 --> 00:16:18,602
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you said you brought to Mr. Berman's attention the technical comments for mass DEP.

161
00:16:18,622 --> 00:16:20,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

162
00:16:22,884 --> 00:16:23,124
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

163
00:16:23,364 --> 00:16:23,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

164
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:27,346
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, those only just came in late this afternoon.

165
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:29,487
[SPEAKER_08]: So when I got them, I sent them off to Alex.

166
00:16:30,488 --> 00:16:36,811
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, I think we would be interested in seeing some written response to those as well.

167
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:39,533
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I would be.

168
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:41,894
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, yes.

169
00:16:41,954 --> 00:16:46,156
[SPEAKER_00]: I've already reached out to my contractors so that they can get the pertinent information.

170
00:16:47,097 --> 00:16:47,377
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

171
00:16:52,675 --> 00:17:01,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that one of the comments is that information should be provided on meeting a high watermark, how the meeting a high watermark of the river was determined.

172
00:17:02,403 --> 00:17:20,039
[SPEAKER_00]: Which should be, and Dennis, maybe this is something in the submittal that we use the outdated drawings so that engineer drawings should now include additional calculations per Medford engineering request that I believe do detail that.

173
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:21,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, they should be in there.

174
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:28,993
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just, I will ask, I sent a bunch of the files in, but it wasn't able to be sent electronically.

175
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:35,098
[SPEAKER_08]: But now I know the person who's doing it, so I'm just going to send her everything I have and say, like, I know we sent this, but here's what we have electronically.

176
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:37,620
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully that will clear some things up then.

177
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:41,083
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm pretty sure we had that they said they didn't have.

178
00:17:42,477 --> 00:17:46,541
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's much simpler than, it's top of bank, that's it.

179
00:17:47,622 --> 00:17:49,324
[SPEAKER_05]: And it says so on the plan, top of bank.

180
00:17:49,664 --> 00:17:54,089
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure where that, but that one's an easy response.

181
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,153
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no calculations, it's the top of bank.

182
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:05,580
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very clear, you know, meeting on high water can be tricky in situations where the bank is not,

183
00:18:07,246 --> 00:18:10,247
[SPEAKER_05]: clearly defined, but that this is not the case here.

184
00:18:10,627 --> 00:18:13,348
[SPEAKER_08]: But especially we have a mean high watermark from property next door.

185
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:17,749
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually have a mean high watermark from the West Africa Community Center just down the road.

186
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:23,710
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have two that were done fairly recently that are usable.

187
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,931
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the one from this property as well.

188
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:26,451
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

189
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:27,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

190
00:18:27,891 --> 00:18:28,171
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

191
00:18:28,671 --> 00:18:28,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

192
00:18:29,492 --> 00:18:29,772
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

193
00:18:29,952 --> 00:18:30,152
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

194
00:18:30,372 --> 00:18:30,592
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

195
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:49,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything further from the commissioners?

196
00:18:52,794 --> 00:19:00,059
[SPEAKER_01]: The only question I have is, does anyone feel strongly that we want to see replacement plantings or no?

197
00:19:03,141 --> 00:19:14,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Given that it's the existing plantings or lawn, I would want to see that any future plantings be native.

198
00:19:17,503 --> 00:19:42,037
[SPEAKER_06]: I would go along with that, mainly because we have such active wildlife of birds, not just birds, birds, mammals, et cetera, that we have to be very cautious, and especially as lawns bring potential other kinds of poisons, et cetera, into the river and wash off.

199
00:19:42,638 --> 00:19:46,100
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, I would like to see some native

200
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:52,162
[SPEAKER_06]: plants if in fact the owners decide to go with some landscaping.

201
00:19:53,784 --> 00:19:58,247
[SPEAKER_02]: How would we ask for that to be promulgated?

202
00:19:58,628 --> 00:20:01,330
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that a landscaping plan?

203
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that just a condition?

204
00:20:04,012 --> 00:20:08,676
[SPEAKER_02]: How would we actually call that out if they haven't gotten to the point where they've considered landscaping yet?

205
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:18,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that, I think it was Heidi or Carolyn who basically suggested that, you didn't suggest, but you alluded to this.

206
00:20:18,492 --> 00:20:30,939
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you did, my thought was that we put it in that if and when they get to that point, that perhaps there's a check back or something that could be submitted.

207
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:31,640
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

208
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,922
[SPEAKER_06]: The problem we have, of course, is

209
00:20:36,906 --> 00:20:43,233
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be an additional kind of request and I don't want to add that burden to the owners.

210
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,777
[SPEAKER_06]: If we put it in as a condition for.

211
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:55,869
[SPEAKER_06]: perhaps some consultation or addition to our file, whatever the case may be.

212
00:20:56,769 --> 00:21:08,816
[SPEAKER_08]: I think usually in these situations, especially for homeowners, usually we just ask them, especially if you're dealing with an arborist, just send us a list of potential plantings before you actually plant them and we'll just review.

213
00:21:08,836 --> 00:21:09,576
[SPEAKER_06]: That would satisfy me.

214
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:19,701
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean, arborists pretty much know, you know, just, you know, let the arborists know it's within, you know, riverfront area.

215
00:21:19,761 --> 00:21:27,683
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, that's sort of the stuff that they can usually pull, call up, you know, certain plantings that will thrive and be good for the environment.

216
00:21:28,343 --> 00:21:32,664
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think we in the past have had some listings available just to share.

217
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:38,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I probably have some deep in my files that I can actually look for as well and just send out as well in addition.

218
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:45,845
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we intended to plant local plants that attract pollinators similar to the existing ones anyways.

219
00:21:45,985 --> 00:21:48,125
[SPEAKER_00]: We enjoy having the pollinators around.

220
00:21:50,126 --> 00:21:50,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

221
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:53,847
[SPEAKER_05]: Good to hear.

222
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:56,588
[SPEAKER_05]: So the commission may disagree with me, and that's fine.

223
00:21:56,628 --> 00:22:00,289
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just wanted to give my opinion regarding DEP's comments.

224
00:22:01,209 --> 00:22:08,171
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel they're a little generic and do not take into account that there's a road between this lot and the river.

225
00:22:10,795 --> 00:22:22,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And so indicating construction access areas, stockpile locations, construction methodology, existing and proposed tree line, and vegetation removal, again, does not seem specific to this project.

226
00:22:23,897 --> 00:22:38,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And my opinion, and again, you all may disagree, is that I am comfortable issuing without waiting for a response, but I will defer to my board.

227
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,737
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you make a good point, Heidi.

228
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:54,305
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I've got the other board members here.

229
00:22:54,865 --> 00:22:57,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

230
00:22:58,227 --> 00:23:03,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my only hesitation isn't with DPS technical comments.

231
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:10,616
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of the location of the trees and actually seeing where they do land.

232
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,179
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree with Caroline on that.

233
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little confused by the 2 plans issued a month apart.

234
00:23:20,363 --> 00:23:21,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Disagree on where the trees are.

235
00:23:22,413 --> 00:23:25,255
[SPEAKER_02]: would like just a little bit more clarity before signing off on it?

236
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:32,221
[SPEAKER_00]: I can provide a little bit of context, and wasn't too happy with my engineer on this.

237
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:47,913
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one was... I'll have to look at it again, but my recollection is that the first one was inaccurate, so we told them what the actual measurements were, and then they provided another one, which also didn't appear to be too accurate, and asked that they

238
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:53,144
[SPEAKER_00]: redo it according to the measurements and they said that they would if asked to.

239
00:23:53,644 --> 00:23:58,046
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're asking to, we can certainly reach back out to them and let them know.

240
00:23:59,007 --> 00:23:59,867
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we're asking.

241
00:24:00,888 --> 00:24:02,408
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

242
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:04,549
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're at it, revising the O&M plan as well.

243
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,511
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're coming back anyway, it would be great.

244
00:24:08,551 --> 00:24:15,375
[SPEAKER_00]: The O&M revisions, just to clarify, are separating out the construction items from the property owner items.

245
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:20,213
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term, long-term post-construction versus construction phase.

246
00:24:20,373 --> 00:24:20,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

247
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:25,898
[SPEAKER_02]: And it should be like half an hour in Microsoft Word.

248
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:27,359
[SPEAKER_02]: The checklists are already segregated.

249
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:28,981
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just the instructions on what to do.

250
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:31,443
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be just separate documents for simplicity.

251
00:24:34,365 --> 00:24:34,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

252
00:24:38,108 --> 00:24:41,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have your permission to continue this hearing?

253
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Berman.

254
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,581
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yes, you do.

255
00:24:48,001 --> 00:24:48,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it wasn't clear.

256
00:24:49,041 --> 00:24:50,401
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.

257
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:53,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a motion from the commission?

258
00:24:54,222 --> 00:24:56,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a motion to continue to the next hearing.

259
00:24:58,242 --> 00:25:08,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, normally one would be October 1st, but I know Alex has been traveling and I don't know if that's a doable date.

260
00:25:08,604 --> 00:25:12,925
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd probably defer to your schedule for a continued date.

261
00:25:15,273 --> 00:25:16,414
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we can do October 1st.

262
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:17,835
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find a way to make it work.

263
00:25:20,296 --> 00:25:25,660
[SPEAKER_08]: If not, just shoot me an email and we'll just adjust the notices.

264
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,021
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

265
00:25:27,921 --> 00:25:28,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a second?

266
00:25:28,702 --> 00:25:30,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

267
00:25:31,743 --> 00:25:32,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Carolyn.

268
00:25:33,224 --> 00:25:33,865
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favor?

269
00:25:34,125 --> 00:25:34,265
Aye.

270
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:35,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Carolyn?

271
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:35,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

272
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:37,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Heather?

273
00:25:37,847 --> 00:25:37,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

274
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:39,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Craig?

275
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:40,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

276
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:41,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeremy?

277
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:42,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

278
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:43,811
[SPEAKER_05]: And myself as an aye.

279
00:25:45,773 --> 00:25:50,034
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for coming tonight and we look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks.

280
00:25:50,054 --> 00:25:52,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all.

281
00:25:52,255 --> 00:25:53,695
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate your time.

282
00:25:53,715 --> 00:25:53,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

283
00:25:58,936 --> 00:25:59,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

284
00:26:00,577 --> 00:26:03,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Next item on the agenda is notice of intent for 173 Arlington Street.

285
00:26:08,659 --> 00:26:09,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Don Foote has filed

286
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:22,384
[SPEAKER_08]: and abbreviate notice of intent to construct in addition to the rear of the house and add a deck at 171 Arlington Street within the 200-foot Woodhurn area in Borderland, subject to flooding in Medford.

287
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:28,188
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

288
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:30,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw Mr. Foote on the call.

289
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,770
[SPEAKER_05]: Is he still on the call?

290
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:33,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

291
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:34,471
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

292
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:35,272
[SPEAKER_05]: Right in front of me.

293
00:26:36,653 --> 00:26:38,514
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you briefly describe your project to us?

294
00:26:42,256 --> 00:26:42,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

295
00:26:42,637 --> 00:26:43,077
[SPEAKER_05]: You're muted, Don.

296
00:26:49,133 --> 00:26:49,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

297
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:53,015
[SPEAKER_07]: So my house is identical to Alex's house.

298
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:56,757
[SPEAKER_07]: They were built, I think, by the same builder, exact same location on the lot.

299
00:26:57,438 --> 00:27:00,720
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty odd, but beautiful old homes.

300
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:02,621
[SPEAKER_07]: Tiny house.

301
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:06,843
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 910 square feet, I believe, all told.

302
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:13,087
[SPEAKER_07]: My wife and I love the location and love the older look of it.

303
00:27:14,828 --> 00:27:17,790
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not really, it's just, it's tiny.

304
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,271
[SPEAKER_07]: and we're putting a very small addition on the back.

305
00:27:21,851 --> 00:27:27,773
[SPEAKER_07]: It's 12 1⁄2 feet out, and we're staying with the exact width of the existing house, which is about 19 1⁄2 feet.

306
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:31,794
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't have a basement under it.

307
00:27:31,814 --> 00:27:34,874
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on piers, and then a small deck behind that.

308
00:27:36,435 --> 00:27:47,158
[SPEAKER_07]: We really tried to size it for the lot because the lot isn't that big, and the lot and the house had been pretty let go

309
00:27:49,955 --> 00:27:53,597
[SPEAKER_07]: The yard was just overgrown and a lot of debris back there.

310
00:27:53,677 --> 00:27:59,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And the house hadn't been updated in, I don't know, forever.

311
00:27:59,741 --> 00:28:01,002
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, we're bringing it back.

312
00:28:01,062 --> 00:28:03,603
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going all electric, getting solar panels on the roof.

313
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:05,985
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's what we're doing.

314
00:28:07,746 --> 00:28:07,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

315
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:08,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

316
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:12,328
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, would you mind pulling up that plan, please?

317
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:15,190
[SPEAKER_08]: Reading them out.

318
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,251
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll pull up the one to the right.

319
00:28:19,746 --> 00:28:23,468
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did not receive any comments on this one?

320
00:28:23,908 --> 00:28:25,029
[SPEAKER_08]: No, there were no comments.

321
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:25,989
[SPEAKER_08]: No?

322
00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:26,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

323
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:30,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's been, they've had it for three weeks.

324
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:38,115
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is, do you want me to zoom out a little bit?

325
00:28:38,295 --> 00:28:43,338
[SPEAKER_07]: You can see, you can see Alex's tree located right on the fence line on my plan.

326
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:44,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

327
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know why that surveyor can't get the tree in the right place.

328
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:50,118
[SPEAKER_07]: That's kind of odd.

329
00:28:50,158 --> 00:28:51,959
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's the tree.

330
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:52,599
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where it is.

331
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:54,260
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

332
00:28:57,722 --> 00:29:00,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And do you plan on retaining these trees?

333
00:29:00,984 --> 00:29:01,605
[SPEAKER_07]: About what?

334
00:29:02,966 --> 00:29:04,647
[SPEAKER_05]: The trees that are on the property line.

335
00:29:04,907 --> 00:29:07,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, are they being retained, or will they be?

336
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:07,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.

337
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:09,030
[SPEAKER_07]: We're keeping all the trees.

338
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,750
[SPEAKER_07]: We love the trees.

339
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,011
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a nice, shady lot.

340
00:29:11,151 --> 00:29:12,852
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not break sun lovers.

341
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:17,472
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to plant some shade plants back there eventually.

342
00:29:17,512 --> 00:29:19,934
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, it's a nice shady yard.

343
00:29:19,974 --> 00:29:20,435
[SPEAKER_07]: It's beautiful.

344
00:29:22,797 --> 00:29:28,042
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at the top down view, there's a really nice canopy pretty much covering the entire backyard.

345
00:29:28,282 --> 00:29:32,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see it's a very small addition.

346
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:35,850
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

347
00:29:40,535 --> 00:29:44,617
[SPEAKER_07]: And we already have the rainwater retention plan approved by city engineering.

348
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:50,001
[SPEAKER_07]: That this plan has been approved, what he has right here.

349
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:51,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

350
00:29:52,202 --> 00:29:54,704
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

351
00:29:54,844 --> 00:29:58,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Commission, do you have any questions, comments?

352
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:06,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing from me.

353
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:08,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing from me.

354
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,042
[SPEAKER_01]: The only point of clarification, I am obsessed with ownership today, I guess.

355
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:18,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you, Mr. Foote, the owner of the LLC that owns the home?

356
00:30:18,924 --> 00:30:20,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, we bought it as a trust.

357
00:30:20,644 --> 00:30:21,745
[SPEAKER_07]: But yes, that's our trust.

358
00:30:21,805 --> 00:30:24,086
[SPEAKER_07]: And my wife and I, this is not a flip.

359
00:30:24,126 --> 00:30:26,847
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a place that we're going to keep for ourselves.

360
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,067
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thanks.

361
00:30:28,267 --> 00:30:32,289
[SPEAKER_01]: And any other significant vegetation being removed?

362
00:30:32,829 --> 00:30:34,430
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there's nothing in the backyard.

363
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,371
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, thanks.

364
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:37,031
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a mess.

365
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:52,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar to the previous project, I'd recommend some tree protection around those existing trees to prevent any heavy equipment from rolling over their critical root zone.

366
00:30:52,089 --> 00:30:55,290
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm not digging any.

367
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:03,532
[SPEAKER_07]: Except for the pit that we're digging there, there is going to be no heavy equipment in the yard at all because the addition is way back there and it's just three piers that it's going on.

368
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:07,073
[SPEAKER_07]: We can do that, but it shouldn't be an issue.

369
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Will construction access be from Arlington Street?

370
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:14,504
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, right down the driveway.

371
00:31:19,307 --> 00:31:22,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the back of the lot is fully fenced in and we're going to leave that fence up the whole time.

372
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:39,180
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we want to talk about possible conditions then?

373
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:53,753
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not feeling anything.

374
00:31:53,833 --> 00:32:01,380
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be in favor if any vegetation besides lawn, that it be required to be native to the area.

375
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:13,172
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no issue with, I mean, I haven't thought about a landscaping plan, but I love whatever we can get to grow up back there in the deep shade.

376
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:16,114
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it is, the whole yard.

377
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:19,997
[SPEAKER_07]: But we're not trying to plant a bunch of exotic plants.

378
00:32:20,017 --> 00:32:24,600
[SPEAKER_07]: We'd like to have just a pollinator garden and whatever we can get to grow in the shade.

379
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, it's deep shade back there.

380
00:32:28,142 --> 00:32:29,183
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that would be challenging.

381
00:32:29,523 --> 00:32:30,564
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it always is.

382
00:32:40,588 --> 00:32:42,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, Dennis, this one's pretty straightforward then.

383
00:32:43,971 --> 00:32:44,992
[SPEAKER_05]: Just our standard.

384
00:32:45,012 --> 00:32:47,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Standard conditions, so.

385
00:32:50,016 --> 00:32:50,897
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

386
00:32:51,437 --> 00:32:52,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Do I have a motion?

387
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:06,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Make a motion to issue an order of conditions for 173 Arlington Street with the one non-standard condition as noted by Caroline that

388
00:33:07,236 --> 00:33:11,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Any new vegetation installed should be installed, planted, should be native.

389
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:15,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

390
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:17,318
[SPEAKER_05]: Second?

391
00:33:17,978 --> 00:33:18,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

392
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:21,119
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favor?

393
00:33:21,219 --> 00:33:21,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Caroline?

394
00:33:22,619 --> 00:33:22,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

395
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:23,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Heather?

396
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:24,699
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

397
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:25,600
[SPEAKER_05]: Greg?

398
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:26,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

399
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:27,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeremy?

400
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:32,221
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeremy's muted.

401
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:41,071
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, if you can hear me, I thank you and myself and I. Great well, thanks so much.

402
00:33:41,872 --> 00:33:43,793
[SPEAKER_05]: You're very welcome.

403
00:33:44,414 --> 00:33:46,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Don, I sort of talked about this a few days ago, so I'm just going to write up.

404
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,557
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get the decision, get it to you.

405
00:33:49,597 --> 00:33:52,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll get it signed and then there is an appeals period started.

406
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,082
[SPEAKER_08]: But what I was thinking of is that you need to do interior work on the house.

407
00:33:56,543 --> 00:33:57,123
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we do.

408
00:33:57,924 --> 00:33:59,064
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I can do is.

409
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:03,910
[SPEAKER_08]: I can approve it so you can get started just on interior work.

410
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,631
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great, thank you.

411
00:34:05,731 --> 00:34:14,399
[SPEAKER_08]: That'll sort of get you sort of jump-started, as opposed to having to wait for the entire time to get, because the interior work has no effect on ComCom, so.

412
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:14,999
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great.

413
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll do that before I leave tonight, just get that in there so you can go down tomorrow and get it.

414
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:21,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, appreciate your help.

415
00:34:21,545 --> 00:34:22,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dennis.

416
00:34:22,425 --> 00:34:24,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Great, okay.

417
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:26,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for coming.

418
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:26,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

419
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:38,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Dennis, do you have any minutes for us?

420
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't.

421
00:34:41,278 --> 00:34:41,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

422
00:34:41,758 --> 00:34:46,763
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm dealing with some familial things.

423
00:34:46,783 --> 00:34:53,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, my mom, I had to take her to a few medical appointments in the last week and it sort of took me out of getting some stuff done.

424
00:34:55,024 --> 00:34:57,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm out again tomorrow, taking her to another appointment.

425
00:34:57,025 --> 00:35:03,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be in in the afternoon, and I think that's really, I'm kind of, I'm probably going to come in this weekend and just work on it, because at the same time, I can't really do stuff.

426
00:35:03,807 --> 00:35:08,129
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll get your stuff shortly, because I've got the software to do it.

427
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:09,889
[SPEAKER_06]: A little more specific timeline, Dennis.

428
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:15,851
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll... Start yelling at me on Monday if I haven't got you anything.

429
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:17,772
[SPEAKER_08]: And I mean genuinely yelling.

430
00:35:18,052 --> 00:35:19,513
[SPEAKER_08]: That always works.

431
00:35:20,273 --> 00:35:20,393
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

432
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:22,233
[SPEAKER_08]: How backed up are we?

433
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:23,634
[SPEAKER_08]: What month are we?

434
00:35:23,674 --> 00:35:24,514
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a few months behind.

435
00:35:25,174 --> 00:35:26,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Like January, I think?

436
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,196
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, there's some, there's some, I know I've definitely done some.

437
00:35:29,256 --> 00:35:30,736
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just trying to, let me look.

438
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:36,358
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not that far close.

439
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:37,898
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

440
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:38,439
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

441
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:43,460
[SPEAKER_06]: How about you just get an email out to us with where we stand and what we're waiting for?

442
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,980
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be.

443
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,142
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's, the last one I have done is July, so I have,

444
00:35:49,243 --> 00:35:51,348
[SPEAKER_08]: May and July, so 7-21 I have done.

445
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:51,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

446
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:52,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

447
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:56,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Dennis, rather than trying to figure this out tonight, why not?

448
00:35:57,658 --> 00:36:03,163
[SPEAKER_06]: put something together, let us know exactly what's missing, and give us a general timeline.

449
00:36:03,183 --> 00:36:07,547
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't know about other people, but my memory is fading.

450
00:36:07,627 --> 00:36:08,028
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm old.

451
00:36:08,088 --> 00:36:09,049
[SPEAKER_06]: My memory is fading.

452
00:36:09,249 --> 00:36:11,811
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to see these before it completely goes.

453
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:12,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Mine is too, Heather.

454
00:36:13,513 --> 00:36:15,194
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

455
00:36:15,935 --> 00:36:19,979
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Dennis, I can volunteer to take one meeting, if that's helpful.

456
00:36:21,874 --> 00:36:25,257
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to send me the recording, I will commit it.

457
00:36:26,038 --> 00:36:36,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis, the only other thing is just double check that that July wasn't a one-off and that we are fully backed prior to that July meeting.

458
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:40,072
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I want to see 5-28.

459
00:36:40,652 --> 00:36:41,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'll go back.

460
00:36:41,593 --> 00:36:42,174
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think so.

461
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:45,237
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll look in what I have, but yeah, I know I have one.

462
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:50,444
[SPEAKER_08]: We haven't had a ton of meetings this year, so I think I have like six for this year or so, I think.

463
00:36:51,285 --> 00:36:55,687
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will go over our meeting schedule versus what's been done.

464
00:36:56,068 --> 00:36:56,448
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do that.

465
00:36:56,468 --> 00:36:57,848
[SPEAKER_02]: And versus what's been approved as well.

466
00:36:57,868 --> 00:36:58,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

467
00:36:58,309 --> 00:36:58,749
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

468
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:00,350
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'll do all that and just send you out.

469
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:04,292
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll be like an Excel spreadsheet checklist type thing, sort of itemizing that.

470
00:37:07,194 --> 00:37:11,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And... Would you stop sharing, Dennis?

471
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:11,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, sorry.

472
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:13,277
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm...

473
00:37:15,508 --> 00:37:18,614
[SPEAKER_08]: And when you said that, I was like, I didn't think I was sharing too much information.

474
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I was talking too much.

475
00:37:21,757 --> 00:37:24,038
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm usually pretty close to the best.

476
00:37:24,758 --> 00:37:42,464
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been trying to get some photos off my phone and not succeeding super well, because my phone is haunted.

477
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:47,686
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think I might have a couple showing South Street.

478
00:37:52,067 --> 00:38:03,155
[SPEAKER_08]: The owner is still looking for the list he got from his arborist about what was planted, like the full, because arborist pointed stuff over what was on our list and he planted a few extra things in there than what was like on the landscape plan, but.

479
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:06,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I make a question to the commission?

480
00:38:09,099 --> 00:38:17,385
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're at the point where colloquially we've had plantings beyond what was approved and this

481
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:27,422
[SPEAKER_02]: project has, for the most part, completed work, to what extent is it worth just letting it go?

482
00:38:27,442 --> 00:38:38,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I feel like we're not having the answers and having this guy come back to us several times.

483
00:38:39,705 --> 00:38:40,805
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been patient with us.

484
00:38:41,746 --> 00:38:47,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to gauge the willingness of the commission to keep chasing this down.

485
00:38:50,353 --> 00:38:50,913
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, Craig.

486
00:38:51,733 --> 00:38:56,954
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I don't really have a willingness, especially when he said that he thought we approved the plan.

487
00:38:58,034 --> 00:38:59,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't have a response to that.

488
00:39:00,135 --> 00:39:00,955
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so.

489
00:39:00,975 --> 00:39:10,517
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.

490
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:15,938
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure it's worth our energy to keep trying to chase this down.

491
00:39:17,673 --> 00:39:20,637
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my memory that we now have more

492
00:39:22,197 --> 00:39:28,562
[SPEAKER_06]: plants than we originally requested with all that's gone on, at least according to what he has said.

493
00:39:28,662 --> 00:39:31,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm assuming that Dennis has visited.

494
00:39:31,524 --> 00:39:32,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

495
00:39:32,385 --> 00:39:34,967
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we ahead of the game at least at this point?

496
00:39:35,007 --> 00:39:35,627
[SPEAKER_06]: It appears so.

497
00:39:35,647 --> 00:39:40,111
[SPEAKER_08]: We definitely planted more in there than was on the map.

498
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:43,533
[SPEAKER_08]: Like the number of shrubs and things like that, there's more in there.

499
00:39:43,993 --> 00:39:47,236
[SPEAKER_08]: And the trees are pretty much what were requested.

500
00:39:48,917 --> 00:39:50,478
[SPEAKER_08]: One of them, the calipers were bigger.

501
00:39:50,558 --> 00:39:54,280
[SPEAKER_08]: The other one, they were slightly smaller, just because that was the availability of what he had.

502
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:01,003
[SPEAKER_08]: He said he didn't want to try and wait around and miss the planting season and not get the trees in this year.

503
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:05,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember the initial landscaper commenting, you know, we'll do our best.

504
00:40:06,046 --> 00:40:07,106
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be plus or minus.

505
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:10,928
[SPEAKER_02]: So that lines up with my memory of the situation.

506
00:40:12,048 --> 00:40:18,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Dennis, is he saying that he's planted according to that plan that we've reviewed most recently?

507
00:40:18,672 --> 00:40:21,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

508
00:40:21,614 --> 00:40:21,895
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.

509
00:40:21,915 --> 00:40:25,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I agree that we don't need to spend much more energy on it.

510
00:40:25,577 --> 00:40:28,239
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think it's worth seeing it.

511
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:40,227
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd be happy to take a walk by there sometime in the next week and just put eyes on it and make sure that it aligns with my reading of the plan and what he's described.

512
00:40:41,935 --> 00:40:47,597
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I was over there in his walkthrough, there were a couple of plants, not in the front, but in the back, that didn't quite take that he's replanted.

513
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:53,319
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you see anything like that, he is on it to replace.

514
00:40:54,059 --> 00:41:01,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the other option, he eventually will need to come for a certificate of compliance with us.

515
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:05,990
[SPEAKER_01]: where we get to review the as-built plan to the approved plan.

516
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:11,176
[SPEAKER_01]: That's also another opportunity if something needs to be fine-tuned.

517
00:41:11,196 --> 00:41:17,803
[SPEAKER_05]: If we suddenly find that the entire plot is lawn, I guess that would be an issue.

518
00:41:18,484 --> 00:41:20,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

519
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:22,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

520
00:41:25,467 --> 00:41:39,259
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only other thing I can think of is, well, we kind of talked about it briefly, a little bit at the last meeting about the work that's going to be going down on Mississippi Valley Parkway down in West Medford, the crosswalk.

521
00:41:42,962 --> 00:41:49,848
[SPEAKER_03]: And... Are those the new paint changes, Dennis, or is there a different project?

522
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry, Jerry.

523
00:41:51,581 --> 00:41:52,381
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

524
00:41:52,421 --> 00:41:57,865
[SPEAKER_08]: So a little bit further down the road, and it's across just trying to get the road name correct.

525
00:42:00,607 --> 00:42:03,448
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a secondary part that I wanted to bring up because that's been.

526
00:42:04,209 --> 00:42:14,075
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you go a little bit further down on the parkway across the street from Lakeview Avenue, there's a crosswalk, there's a street, there's a walk, there's a walking path, there's like a crosswalk there.

527
00:42:14,476 --> 00:42:16,317
[SPEAKER_08]: And what they're going to be doing is putting an elevated

528
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:23,103
[SPEAKER_08]: walkway across there to try to slow down some folks, because there's been some incidents, and I believe some of us hit last year.

529
00:42:23,863 --> 00:42:25,024
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're doing that there.

530
00:42:25,264 --> 00:42:26,204
[SPEAKER_05]: He wasn't just hit.

531
00:42:27,304 --> 00:42:27,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no.

532
00:42:28,085 --> 00:42:28,645
[SPEAKER_08]: He was killed.

533
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:29,665
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I'm sorry.

534
00:42:29,685 --> 00:42:31,145
[SPEAKER_08]: I just heard hit.

535
00:42:31,325 --> 00:42:31,885
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, jeez.

536
00:42:31,965 --> 00:42:32,186
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

537
00:42:32,606 --> 00:42:32,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

538
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:33,046
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.

539
00:42:33,106 --> 00:42:35,006
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very unfortunate.

540
00:42:35,546 --> 00:42:36,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

541
00:42:36,747 --> 00:42:36,927
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

542
00:42:36,947 --> 00:42:42,708
[SPEAKER_08]: So for that, and it falls out of our jurisdiction, but they kind of want to just go over with me because it's work along the river.

543
00:42:42,968 --> 00:42:45,809
[SPEAKER_08]: And they're also, it's sort of tying into the work along High Street.

544
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:52,945
[SPEAKER_08]: So the re-striping stuff they've done now, for now, they are also planning on doing some work along there as well.

545
00:42:52,985 --> 00:42:58,949
[SPEAKER_08]: I just heard from DCR and they sent me a few things just today that I need to reveal.

546
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:04,832
[SPEAKER_08]: So it will be another filing there for the work there, probably fairly soon.

547
00:43:05,392 --> 00:43:06,573
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know the timing on it.

548
00:43:07,947 --> 00:43:16,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the interesting thing is when I had the other meeting about the one across Lakeview, I brought that up because I thought there was, and they were like, no, no, that's a long ways away in the future.

549
00:43:16,355 --> 00:43:22,020
[SPEAKER_08]: And now two weeks later, and they're like, somebody else from DCR is like, we're going forward with this.

550
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:27,886
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's probably just two different groups with funding that they somehow managed to pull.

551
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:39,394
[SPEAKER_06]: So for our next meeting on October 1st, we'll have a continuation of the first fellow today.

552
00:43:40,195 --> 00:43:43,576
[SPEAKER_06]: And is there a possibility that what you're talking about?

553
00:43:43,856 --> 00:43:44,056
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

554
00:43:44,337 --> 00:43:44,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

555
00:43:44,857 --> 00:43:48,879
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there anything else that you have that might be coming up on the first?

556
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:51,140
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, just meeting minutes to approve.

557
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:52,641
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, sir.

558
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:55,062
[SPEAKER_08]: But, but, uh,

559
00:44:02,285 --> 00:44:02,505
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

560
00:44:03,026 --> 00:44:04,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, then I think we can close the hearing.

561
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:08,630
[SPEAKER_05]: Make a motion to close the hearing.

562
00:44:10,152 --> 00:44:10,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Seconded.

563
00:44:11,513 --> 00:44:11,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

564
00:44:11,853 --> 00:44:12,414
[SPEAKER_05]: All in favor?

565
00:44:12,454 --> 00:44:12,774
[SPEAKER_05]: Heather?

566
00:44:12,794 --> 00:44:13,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

567
00:44:14,295 --> 00:44:14,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Fred?

568
00:44:15,316 --> 00:44:15,456
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

569
00:44:16,377 --> 00:44:18,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Jeremy and offspring?

570
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:21,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Oui.

571
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:22,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Caroline?

572
00:44:22,863 --> 00:44:25,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, how cute.

573
00:44:25,325 --> 00:44:26,646
[SPEAKER_05]: I see myself as an aye.

574
00:44:28,347 --> 00:44:29,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Adorable, Jeremy.

575
00:44:29,788 --> 00:44:30,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

576
00:44:31,788 --> 00:44:34,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all very much for attending.

577
00:44:34,297 --> 00:44:35,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Have a good evening.

578
00:44:35,742 --> 00:44:36,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.

579
00:44:36,685 --> 00:44:37,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Good night.

580
00:44:37,749 --> 00:44:38,210
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care, y'all.

581
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:38,511
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
