00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,301
17005 offered by Councilor Caraviglia.

181
00:19:13,722 --> 00:19:24,666
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council allow Alan McDonald of Hallmark Health to address the City Council in regards to the progress of the Hallmark Health merger.

182
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,640
Thank you, Councilman.

183
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,603
Mr. President.

184
00:19:31,763 --> 00:19:32,844
Name and address for the record, please.

185
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:34,545
My name is Alan McDonald.

186
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:43,090
I'm President and Chief Executive Officer of Hall-Markell System, which includes, of course, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, of which we're so proud.

187
00:19:44,091 --> 00:19:46,753
And it's a great honor for me to be here for this evening.

188
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,995
And I want to congratulate you, Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, and the whole council.

189
00:19:51,596 --> 00:19:53,057
This is a wonderful step.

190
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:53,977
It's going to be a great year.

191
00:19:54,297 --> 00:19:54,918
Thank you very much.

192
00:19:55,763 --> 00:20:08,534
I'm here with Dr. Michelson and Mrs. Michelson, Dr. Marano, and Mr. Terrabelsi, all wonderful supporters over many, many years of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, as has this council.

193
00:20:09,395 --> 00:20:21,385
And I want to thank this council very much for the last four or five years, you've been working with us towards an affiliation for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital and Hallmark Health that's going to strengthen

194
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,304
the healthcare services in this city for generations to come, in my opinion.

195
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:49,184
And as you know, we just, as of January 1 of this year, two days ago, became effectively partnered with Tufts Medical Center and Circle Health, which is Lowell General Hospital in Lowell, which is a major hospital, uh, to work with Hallmark Health, three founding members of a new parent organization called Wellforce.

196
00:20:50,052 --> 00:21:03,620
And we will be equal members on the board of trustees for that charitable parent organization, seven trustees from our community, seven from Tufts Medical and seven from Lowell.

197
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:12,545
And we will be making investments in our healthcare facilities and services for again, the next generation to come.

198
00:21:13,403 --> 00:21:20,286
And I wanted to bring that news in person at your invitation, Mr. President, because it is momentous.

199
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:25,768
As you know, we've had 92 and a half years, almost 93 years for the Lawrence.

200
00:21:26,668 --> 00:21:42,515
And the last couple of years, as healthcare has changed, as the patient base is using acute care hospitals in a little different way, because so much more can be outpatient and ambulatory, but we still have a lot of need for inpatient care.

201
00:21:43,246 --> 00:22:02,739
And so we need to adjust to make sure that we're offering the level of services for the future that will warrant investment in the Lawrence, particularly, and that will draw the patient volume to match our capability to provide the services.

202
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:10,705
We have tremendous talent in terms of physicians and nurses and technical staff at the Lawrence.

203
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:15,270
Where, as Dr. Michelson always says to me, we're open for business.

204
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,131
And yes, we are.

205
00:22:16,191 --> 00:22:17,933
We have been for 92 plus years.

206
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:21,215
And we intend to be for some time to come.

207
00:22:22,156 --> 00:22:23,217
And that's our goal.

208
00:22:23,457 --> 00:22:37,129
And we find in partnering with Tufts Medical Center in particular, which means so much to this community, that the university itself and the School of Medicine, which are apart from the center, but they're all part of the same network.

209
00:22:37,949 --> 00:22:45,752
that they, all of those organizations, were so excited that we were interested in becoming part of their network.

210
00:22:46,312 --> 00:22:52,655
And we're going to see over the next few years' time more of what we call specialty services in the community.

211
00:22:53,395 --> 00:22:55,296
And that's a tremendous step for us.

212
00:22:56,436 --> 00:23:05,760
As we've discussed with this council over the last few years, we have looked at partnerships with other people, and this council has been supportive of that.

213
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:09,118
seven to zero, and we appreciate it very, very much.

214
00:23:09,998 --> 00:23:18,261
Uh, what happened is, you know, the state itself, Commonwealth of Massachusetts, wanted us to look at all the options that might be available to us.

215
00:23:18,861 --> 00:23:28,304
Well, there were many, and we had wonderful business proposals from a number of organizations that were very proud to say, wanted to be associated with Hallmark Health.

216
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,504
In the end,

217
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:39,979
For us to see a governance opportunity where we could have a lot to say about the future of our community in the larger network, that was what was most attractive.

218
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:49,364
Much more than just reporting to a larger organization and waiting to hear what the organization felt was most important to our community.

219
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:53,345
We would like to be the party that influences that future.

220
00:23:53,986 --> 00:23:59,268
And that's what this opportunity is going to give us more than any other business opportunity that came to us.

221
00:24:00,012 --> 00:24:08,399
But I wanted to bring that news here and I wanted to be able to respond to any questions you might have about our governance structure or what it might mean.

222
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:15,704
We don't expect there'll be abrupt changes or anything really quick because we are not giving our license away.

223
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:21,549
We are not entering into any new business pattern at the moment.

224
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:28,715
We are operating as we have been and will continue to do and we will grow with it and we're going to grow over time.

225
00:24:29,498 --> 00:24:37,325
The real excitement of this is that we're going to have partners with us who care as much about our community as we do.

226
00:24:37,845 --> 00:24:41,368
And that was the selling point on this arrangement.

227
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:56,842
And we are going to sit down in this month in particular, have a number of meetings next week and two weeks from now that will relate to business planning, will relate to investment structure that we will be wanting to invest

228
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:02,877
some capital that we have held back on in the last few years while we've waited for the affiliation to happen.

229
00:25:03,677 --> 00:25:18,642
And we're going to take a long look at what would be best in particular for the Lawrence and for other facilities that we have, not just the Lawrence, but I think we really start there and say, we want to make sure that we're doing something that's right for the community.

230
00:25:19,563 --> 00:25:24,824
I would hope that, um, we would, we would get together again in the near future with the Tufts people.

231
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:26,165
Uh, so, so,

232
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:34,345
us as a council in the city would know what direction the hospital is going and for as far as services and, uh, and changes that that is going to be made.

233
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:36,286
So again, Alan, I thank you for coming down.

234
00:25:36,886 --> 00:25:40,308
And if any of our counselors, uh, council marks.

235
00:25:41,569 --> 00:25:42,489
Thank you, Mr. President.

236
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:45,931
And, uh, first I'd like to thank president McDonald.

237
00:25:46,492 --> 00:25:53,695
Uh, this is probably maybe the seventh or eighth time he's appeared before this method city council providing us with updates along the way.

238
00:25:54,336 --> 00:25:56,297
And it's been very helpful, at least to me,

239
00:25:57,134 --> 00:26:07,159
when residents call and actually employees of Hallmark Health and want to know what the scoop is, I can unequivocally tell them things that I've heard you mention.

240
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:09,340
And so that's been very helpful.

241
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:19,424
I just want to reassure people because I know the number of calls I did receive, people are concerned about prompt care and the emergency area.

242
00:26:20,184 --> 00:26:26,147
Are we going to see any change to the prompt care emergency area under this merger agreement?

243
00:26:27,937 --> 00:26:36,440
The short answer is no, and you always want to say, for what time, to the year 2340, or what is it?

244
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:41,681
What my communication team always tells me, nothing changes until it does change.

245
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,322
Everything stays the same until it changes.

246
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:56,365
Our intention is to continue for as long as we can look ahead at our ability to provide urgent care, emergency care, and acute care at the Long Island Memorial Hospital.

247
00:26:57,256 --> 00:27:11,349
We have been making some changes because we need to make sure that we can attract the investment to reinvest in the Lawrence that will see a volume to match the investment.

248
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:18,495
So we are trying to judge what the patient base is most interested in, in terms of using the facility.

249
00:27:18,676 --> 00:27:23,340
Naturally, we've done as we have in the past in the orthopedics and

250
00:27:23,868 --> 00:27:26,830
I just had a discussion now about our interest in pediatrics.

251
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:31,594
We have a strong interest in trying to figure out how to do more in that area if we can.

252
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:42,321
But we're looking at a number of different areas that we'd like to do more in that with the help of Tufts Medical Center we might be able to do that we might not be able to do on our own.

253
00:27:43,002 --> 00:27:50,287
And so what complements each one of those systems and services is what the future will dictate for us.

254
00:27:50,862 --> 00:27:56,664
But certainly our intention is to maintain what we have now and grow from there.

255
00:27:56,684 --> 00:28:00,105
Uh, and uh, there's no timetable on it.

256
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:00,685
That's the thing.

257
00:28:00,725 --> 00:28:11,548
When people ask me as they have asked you, I've been involved since the 1980s with the hospital folks here have been involved a little longer, but that's a pretty good long stretch.

258
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:16,470
But I've been asked since the 1980s almost each and every year, are we going to do

259
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,951
forever certain things at the Lawrence.

260
00:28:18,991 --> 00:28:22,672
And I say, well, you asked me 10 years ago, we're still doing it.

261
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:24,093
Five years ago, we're still doing it.

262
00:28:24,573 --> 00:28:28,094
It's possible 25 years from now, we would be doing something different.

263
00:28:28,595 --> 00:28:38,979
It's very important for us to look at what the changes in the healthcare industry are so that we maintain our presence at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

264
00:28:38,999 --> 00:28:44,501
Some communities, as we know, don't have that presence anymore because they didn't adapt.

265
00:28:44,581 --> 00:28:46,702
They weren't able to attract the investments.

266
00:28:47,177 --> 00:28:53,759
We think we're going to attract investments and recruit more talent to what we have in this arrangement.

267
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:55,139
And that's the future for us.

268
00:28:56,219 --> 00:29:02,421
But if we cannot attract the investment or cannot attract the recruiting of top talent, there won't be the future.

269
00:29:02,801 --> 00:29:03,761
We think there will be.

270
00:29:03,821 --> 00:29:04,802
That's our game plan.

271
00:29:04,842 --> 00:29:05,722
That's what we're going to do.

272
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:12,904
So just if I could, Mr. President, the merger that was going to happen with Partners Healthcare.

273
00:29:13,204 --> 00:29:13,344
Yes.

274
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:18,536
From what I understand, Lawrence Memorial Hospital is going to be more of a cardiac center.

275
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:26,157
There was going to be a psychiatry area within Lawrence Memorial, an expanded psychiatry area.

276
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:38,280
Now with Tufts, are we going to be looking at a different focus of specialties or will the focus still be on the focuses that were with Hallmark Health and enhancing those specialties?

277
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:45,531
That is the exact discussion that we're having even this month, and we've had all the way up, and we're going to have through this year.

278
00:29:46,072 --> 00:29:49,496
We're very strong in behavioral health, as you know, at the Lowndes.

279
00:29:50,718 --> 00:29:55,043
We, with partners, looked at the opportunity

280
00:29:55,585 --> 00:30:00,829
to continue using Lawrence in a way that it is now on acute care overnight stay.

281
00:30:01,529 --> 00:30:07,713
We used to have, as you know, 134 bed license that was fairly active well back.

282
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:15,919
We're still very active in certain areas, but the size of that 134 beds is more than we would need.

283
00:30:15,999 --> 00:30:18,321
As I've said during the discussions,

284
00:30:19,081 --> 00:30:33,106
with the partners people, if we invested for 134 acute care beds at the Lawrence, it wouldn't get the use and it wouldn't pay back the investment, and then we would be without a hospital.

285
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:42,690
If we, with partners, that was a different plan, but with partners, if we invested for 30 to 35, what they called short-term beds and other medical services,

286
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:55,958
you would be in a position because that was similar to what the use was when we talked to partners to grow and that if we in 10 years needed 60 beds or a hundred beds, we would be there to grow.

287
00:30:56,419 --> 00:31:05,404
Whereas if we over invest and over promise and we can't pay back the investment, we go the way of some of those other community hospitals that don't exist.

288
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:10,367
And then 10, 15 years when you're ready for it, we're not there to grow.

289
00:31:11,103 --> 00:31:17,126
But if we invest for the way that the population and patient base wants to use the facility,

290
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:29,833
and we have the volume and the community support that you've given us and that the community generally will give us, then we're in a position to grow again as things change, because nothing stays the same as we know.

291
00:31:29,873 --> 00:31:35,954
There's a flow on the way different services provide.

292
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:43,576
We don't need as much open heart surgery as once upon a time, because there's less invasive stuff that we can do for cardiology.

293
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:45,937
All of these services change over time.

294
00:31:45,957 --> 00:31:47,137
So you make the investments.

295
00:31:47,736 --> 00:31:55,177
But they don't last for 25, 30 years because the technology changes, the medical intelligence changes.

296
00:31:55,798 --> 00:32:02,759
We just want, we want to be available for what the near term is to be able to continue growing for the longer term.

297
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:10,901
And that includes in our mind, emergency department, it includes urgent care, it includes certain acute care needs as well.

298
00:32:11,481 --> 00:32:17,482
But exactly what that is, we have to do that now in discussion with Tufts Medical Center, not just ourselves.

299
00:32:18,094 --> 00:32:21,935
What we like about this is they care as much about our community as we do.

300
00:32:22,615 --> 00:32:32,898
And we're now going to be working with somebody that has more resources, more reach for other resources, and, uh, an ability to help us recruit more talent.

301
00:32:34,198 --> 00:32:38,640
If you can keep us in touch every step of the way, be helpful like you've been doing.

302
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,620
I want to do that.

303
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,320
Thank you, Mr. President.

304
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,320
Thank you very much.

305
00:32:42,481 --> 00:32:42,861
Councilman.

306
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:43,101
Okay.

307
00:32:43,824 --> 00:32:44,164
Thank you.

308
00:32:44,344 --> 00:32:50,249
President Carviello, my question kind of revolved around the same thing that Councilor Marks asked.

309
00:32:50,709 --> 00:33:00,756
You said that you're not sure how we're going to grow, but you will grow over time and maintain and figure out what the needs are.

310
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:03,178
And that will be with the help of the trustees.

311
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:06,340
You mentioned orthopedic and possibly pediatrics.

312
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:11,564
Is there anything else that you think would come down the line, whether you've been in talks

313
00:33:12,212 --> 00:33:15,217
Well, we're going to stay strong in internal medicine.

314
00:33:15,238 --> 00:33:18,844
We're going to stay strong in cancer care.

315
00:33:20,227 --> 00:33:24,875
We're going to stay strong in our system on maternal health.

316
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:29,546
Those things are very important to us.

317
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:32,467
We will stay strong in behavioral health as well.

318
00:33:32,527 --> 00:33:42,770
That's an area that we've got a long history in, and the Commonwealth needs a lot of help in that area, frankly, and we'd like to be part of that help.

319
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:47,892
So these are all things that we care tremendously about, and then it's a matter of

320
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:51,701
recruiting the talent in the areas that we want to be good in.

321
00:33:53,444 --> 00:33:56,007
And we continue.

322
00:33:56,087 --> 00:34:02,756
I always say to my gang, you can win the Super Bowl and it doesn't mean you skip the draft the next year.

323
00:34:02,816 --> 00:34:05,600
You're still recruiting off the top of the draft if you can.

324
00:34:06,347 --> 00:34:13,252
We've got a tremendous amount of talent, but we're always looking to grow that talent base because things change.

325
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:17,755
People come and go, and technology changes, as I say.

326
00:34:17,795 --> 00:34:21,718
So we want to continue to be strong in all the places that I mentioned.

327
00:34:22,258 --> 00:34:30,464
But like in any system, again with the flow, you become stronger in certain areas, and then you try to go in other areas as well.

328
00:34:30,504 --> 00:34:31,664
But you play to your strength.

329
00:34:31,784 --> 00:34:35,267
And our strength has been in cardiology, internal medicine,

330
00:34:36,171 --> 00:34:39,953
uh, cancer care, as I say, maternal health.

331
00:34:40,713 --> 00:34:45,015
And we really see an opportunity in pediatrics to do more.

332
00:34:45,615 --> 00:34:51,817
As you know, over the years, we used to deliver babies at the Lawrence, my brother and sister, my older brother and sister were born there.

333
00:34:52,798 --> 00:34:53,738
And, uh, there you go.

334
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:55,759
And my mother was a Cambridge girl.

335
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:57,860
My dad was, but my mother was Cambridge.

336
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,600
She had me at Cambridge city hospital.

337
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,501
I was a third.

338
00:35:00,521 --> 00:35:01,361
I don't know what happened.

339
00:35:02,713 --> 00:35:06,675
But we stopped delivering babies at the Lawrence, but we do other things.

340
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:10,839
And so you can't tell what the long, long term is going to be.

341
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:17,283
But in the immediate term, it is to strengthen what we already have, and then to see where that takes us.

342
00:35:17,804 --> 00:35:23,108
But if we're working as we are going to be with a world class outfit, Tufts Medical Center was established in 1796.

343
00:35:25,241 --> 00:35:31,024
It was founded by Paul Revere and Sam Adams and a few of those folks.

344
00:35:31,544 --> 00:35:34,706
We're going to be tying in with some people who know how to stick around.

345
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,286
And we do too.

346
00:35:37,107 --> 00:35:39,388
And we want to build on that.

347
00:35:39,925 --> 00:35:55,432
We don't know exactly what that means for 2025 or 2030 or 2035, but to us it means that we're going to have a team that wants to be here, that wants to grow and stay with whatever the technology on medical care is.

348
00:35:56,192 --> 00:36:16,438
And one of the things, we've talked about it here and privately among ourselves, that some of the things that we used to do in the hospital and go in for four or five days with, let's say, a hernia operation or a gallbladder operation, we used to go in for four or five days and be told not to move in the bed.

349
00:36:16,478 --> 00:36:21,499
Now we have an afternoon, they take care of us and send us home and call in the morning and say, I hope you're okay.

350
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,620
And we are okay, because we had great talent.

351
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:24,921
There were other things.

352
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:32,808
One of the things, what happens is when we get patients in the hospital now, they're sicker patients than once upon a time in a sense.

353
00:36:34,149 --> 00:36:36,011
I do remember speaking with my dear mother.

354
00:36:36,491 --> 00:36:39,114
She would say, she had seven children.

355
00:36:39,154 --> 00:36:45,239
She said, I love it when I have one of you because they put me in there for a whole week and I get a week off, she would say to me.

356
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,463
when you have a baby.

357
00:36:49,063 --> 00:36:51,044
So they're just a very different thing.

358
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:53,305
And it'll be different in 2025.

359
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:56,026
But we want to be part of it, whatever it is.

360
00:36:56,586 --> 00:36:58,366
And that's what we're trying to do.

361
00:36:58,826 --> 00:36:59,627
We're going to grow with it.

362
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:03,808
And then to follow up on that, I know the partnership's going to help greatly.

363
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:06,109
What resources are there?

364
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:09,050
What better things can we do to make sure we're growing with the times?

365
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,371
Financially, how will we be able to do that?

366
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:16,932
And I guess my follow-up would be, how will you be able to, or hopefully, my hope would be,

367
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:20,559
How are you going to include the community in that discussion?

368
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:44,570
Well, we have, uh, we've been blessed to frankly, uh, for the lifetime of the Lawrence, uh, and we brought it into the hallmark that we have a group of corporate as we call them, but they're really ambassadors, uh, some 130, uh, community, uh, folks who, uh, are very much a part of our committees.

369
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,791
You know, we have, uh, our own,

370
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:50,383
the strategic planning committees that the board of trustees has.

371
00:37:50,403 --> 00:37:54,566
It includes what I call corporators that are not trustees.

372
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,347
They're not employees of the hospital.

373
00:37:56,847 --> 00:38:01,871
They are community people and uh, uh, who just like working for

374
00:38:02,401 --> 00:38:06,182
community interest, because we are still a charitable organization.

375
00:38:06,222 --> 00:38:15,404
We're a not-for-profit charitable outfit, and we lean on the community quite a bit for how we use the resources that are charitable resources.

376
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:20,146
So we will continue to have that group of some 130

377
00:38:21,568 --> 00:38:29,474
corporators that are part of our committees, that are part of our annual meeting, part of our discussion groups that we have when we make these plans.

378
00:38:30,274 --> 00:38:32,356
And that'll be a big piece of what we do.

379
00:38:33,797 --> 00:38:41,302
When we go for the investment, what's interesting about what we've put together is one financially obligated group.

380
00:38:42,183 --> 00:38:48,067
So what that means is when we go to the market for capital money,

381
00:38:49,209 --> 00:38:52,730
That capital money comes to the parent group, Welforce.

382
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,272
And we are one third of the parent group to make the decisions on how to spend the money.

383
00:38:58,992 --> 00:39:02,153
But we will be responsible for our own operations.

384
00:39:02,733 --> 00:39:13,437
But we will be audited and looked at as one financially obligated group with Lowell, Tufts Medical Center, and ourselves.

385
00:39:14,037 --> 00:39:16,838
Now that's an advantage to us in borrowing money.

386
00:39:17,545 --> 00:39:28,818
Because we are much strengthened, frankly, by the volume, some 9,000 employees will make up the well force group.

387
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:36,286
And just a significant opportunity to attract

388
00:39:37,768 --> 00:39:41,390
more than we could ever attract on our own for capital investment.

389
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:43,372
So that was an important thing for us.

390
00:39:43,452 --> 00:39:44,833
It wasn't the number one thing.

391
00:39:44,873 --> 00:39:57,141
The number one thing really is clinical integration, being able to take care of the patient base before they need to come to a hospital, while they're at a hospital situation, and after they're at a hospital situation.

392
00:39:58,301 --> 00:39:59,162
Not too long ago,

393
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:01,539
We really were just a hospital.

394
00:40:01,779 --> 00:40:08,661
And it would be, if you were sick and wanted to come to us, we would take care of you and help you to be better and go back out.

395
00:40:09,421 --> 00:40:16,402
Now, so much of what we do, more than half of what we do, is outside the hospital structure itself.

396
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:17,482
It's in the community.

397
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,062
It's outreach into the community.

398
00:40:19,723 --> 00:40:22,363
And that's a whole different industry for us.

399
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:25,063
But that means different investments, too.

400
00:40:25,864 --> 00:40:27,964
And by teaming up.

401
00:40:28,572 --> 00:40:36,396
with where we can be clinically integrated to fill the gaps that you have as a natural part of being a community hospital.

402
00:40:37,196 --> 00:40:44,920
As a standalone community hospital, you couldn't possibly have all the skills you need to take care of patients, pre-admission to post-discharge.

403
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:49,123
When you're part of a larger organization, you can fill those gaps beautifully.

404
00:40:49,663 --> 00:40:50,803
And that's what we're going to do.

405
00:40:51,264 --> 00:40:57,727
It's going to be a tremendous advantage to this community to have an organization right in the community, right in the city of Medford.

406
00:40:58,114 --> 00:41:02,555
that has that breadth of talent and depth of talent.

407
00:41:02,615 --> 00:41:03,416
That's my question.

408
00:41:03,456 --> 00:41:08,517
Thank you, President McDonnell, for coming and for answering all our questions.

409
00:41:08,557 --> 00:41:10,538
And thank you to the doctors who joined you.

410
00:41:12,078 --> 00:41:12,879
Counselor De La Russo.

411
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:15,319
Thank you, Mr. President.

412
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,040
And thank you, Mr. President.

413
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:26,823
It was a pleasure to work with you during the past few years as the proposals for merger have evolved, and I had

414
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:34,143
great opportunity on a couple occasions to meet with some of those steering committees at the hospital, and I see the fine work that they're doing.

415
00:41:34,723 --> 00:41:44,789
And we know that you're looking at every contingency that you can to preserve the best of the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

416
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,191
With the impending changes in the Universal Health Care Act,

417
00:41:51,217 --> 00:42:03,261
Do you feel that you're prepared to deal with that and how it's going to work with the availability and delivery of services vis-a-vis insurance regulation?

418
00:42:04,381 --> 00:42:12,923
And we can't read minds of what's going on in the mind of he who will be president, but there's a lot coming down the road.

419
00:42:12,943 --> 00:42:14,684
No, we cannot.

420
00:42:16,464 --> 00:42:17,845
The changes in the

421
00:42:19,187 --> 00:42:30,745
regulatory world and the financial world on healthcare have been momentous over the last decade and even in the last half a dozen years in Massachusetts.

422
00:42:30,805 --> 00:42:32,327
But I would say that

423
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:38,611
We're going to be fairly strong in this commonwealth of Massachusetts, whatever happens at the federal level.

424
00:42:39,271 --> 00:42:42,854
We know we're more expensive in Massachusetts for health care than other states.

425
00:42:42,894 --> 00:42:44,235
There are a lot of reasons for that.

426
00:42:44,755 --> 00:42:47,857
Teaching hospitals have a bigger percentage of beds in this state.

427
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:53,561
The level of income for everything in this state is higher, so the costs are higher for lots of things.

428
00:42:54,762 --> 00:42:57,464
So that's something we have to continue to work with.

429
00:42:57,524 --> 00:43:06,568
And one of the things this organization that we're part of now is going to do is bring, we think, more affordable care on specialty services into the community.

430
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:20,996
It's a little different than we were talking about with the partners discussion and other discussions we had that were more about tertiary, ordinary care going into the city, keeping more primary care out here in the community.

431
00:43:21,929 --> 00:43:28,773
This is about looking at not so much having the specialty care in the city of Boston.

432
00:43:29,354 --> 00:43:32,436
It's about having a little bit more of it out in the community over time.

433
00:43:32,796 --> 00:43:36,258
That's going to be more affordable for patients in the long term.

434
00:43:36,298 --> 00:43:42,262
It's going to keep them closer to home and be more convenient for the family visiting and for the patient himself or herself.

435
00:43:43,222 --> 00:43:50,427
What's going to happen at the federal level if they change in the Affordable Care Act, there will be some changes in the assurance

436
00:43:50,974 --> 00:43:52,435
circumstances for sure.

437
00:43:53,636 --> 00:44:03,404
But what this Commonwealth has done, as you know, since 2006, has had the individual mandate, which supposedly the national government was going to build off of.

438
00:44:03,504 --> 00:44:05,846
It's a little different program at the national level.

439
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:09,509
But the fact of the matter is, we still have that in Massachusetts.

440
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,313
It's 10 years in, and people are still supportive of it.

441
00:44:13,996 --> 00:44:16,038
The business community is supportive of it.

442
00:44:16,078 --> 00:44:19,501
The health care for all end of it is very supportive of it.

443
00:44:19,581 --> 00:44:21,242
Insurance industry is supportive.

444
00:44:21,843 --> 00:44:28,729
And so we're all working together to make it work in this commonwealth the way it's not being cooperated with at the national level.

445
00:44:29,409 --> 00:44:34,374
So we're going to continue to work on that among ourselves, the people we work with in Massachusetts.

446
00:44:34,414 --> 00:44:40,179
But it is a bit of worry about what will be the circumstance at the national level

447
00:44:40,817 --> 00:44:44,818
with a change in the Affordable Care Act and nothing in its place.

448
00:44:46,179 --> 00:45:03,825
And it's an interesting story that this commonwealth has led because we started in 1986 with the free care pool that was supported by all the elements with the idea that it would be temporary for free care and bad debt until we could find a way to insure everybody.

449
00:45:04,406 --> 00:45:05,946
It took 20 years to figure it out.

450
00:45:06,767 --> 00:45:09,087
Changes in the free care pool in 1991 and at the end of the 90s.

451
00:45:11,601 --> 00:45:15,763
different ways to fund the free care pool, different ways to take the money out.

452
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:29,910
And eventually, as you know so well, in 2005 and 2006, the legislature put together a plan that we still support in this commonwealth as a group, as a citizenry.

453
00:45:30,631 --> 00:45:33,092
And that's a tremendous advantage for us.

454
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:42,559
And it's tough on the provider side on the finances, because they are really strictly controlled.

455
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,260
But it's up to us to figure out a way to manage that.

456
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:59,082
And it is hard, because you've built a system up, a lot of it built on subsidies, frankly, in the 70s and 80s, that is a relatively expensive system without those subsidies.

457
00:45:59,502 --> 00:46:03,303
And the subsidies are going away a little bit, a little bit more each year, as a matter of fact.

458
00:46:03,966 --> 00:46:12,921
And so the system that was built needs to be fed, but it needs to also be a little different system to come down a little bit on the overhead.

459
00:46:13,682 --> 00:46:14,904
So we're balancing that.

460
00:46:14,964 --> 00:46:18,289
We're trying to make that work, to still provide the services.

461
00:46:19,448 --> 00:46:25,249
lower the overhead as much as we can while we're doing it, uh, and keep ourselves strong, continue to recruit.

462
00:46:25,649 --> 00:46:27,309
So it's a balancing act for sure.

463
00:46:27,329 --> 00:46:30,750
Uh, and, and it doesn't stay the same all the time.

464
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:33,851
So if they change it nationally, we're going to have more balancing to do it.

465
00:46:33,911 --> 00:46:34,491
That's for sure.

466
00:46:35,071 --> 00:46:42,132
But I do think that, uh, this commonwealth is going to figure out a way to keep this industry strong over time.

467
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:43,332
Thank you very much.

468
00:46:43,392 --> 00:46:44,153
Thank you for your leadership.

469
00:46:44,173 --> 00:46:44,893
Thank you.

470
00:46:46,273 --> 00:46:46,693
Councilor Knight.

471
00:46:47,728 --> 00:46:48,929
Mr. President, thank you very much.

472
00:46:48,989 --> 00:46:50,029
Mr. McDonald, good to see you.

473
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:50,549
Happy New Year.

474
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,510
And thank you for coming down this evening.

475
00:46:54,511 --> 00:47:02,315
As you stated, the partnership discussions with the Mass General Hospital were a little different than the ones that you're having now.

476
00:47:02,495 --> 00:47:05,757
And during the discussions with the Mass General Hospital, there was also some talk about

477
00:47:06,204 --> 00:47:09,386
expansion of the campus at Lawrence Memorial Hospital site.

478
00:47:09,987 --> 00:47:19,114
And I know that there's a lot of uncertainty in the area now based upon the newness of this relationship that you're entering into, but are those expansion plans still on the horizon?

479
00:47:20,515 --> 00:47:25,198
I would say we don't have the plans.

480
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,541
I don't know if you'd call them expansion plans or remodeling plans.

481
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:28,901
The,

482
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:36,391
the situation as we look at it is different than it was with partners.

483
00:47:36,971 --> 00:47:50,654
The economic imperative for partners, if I could just make a generalization, but you of course had Dr. Torciani here a year plus back, and he was explaining some of the rationale for partners.

484
00:47:50,694 --> 00:47:56,776
And part of the rationale is that there are a lot of patients in this community

485
00:47:57,625 --> 00:48:03,147
that choose to go to Mass General Hospital for relatively uncomplicated medical procedures.

486
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:13,291
That is something that is not helpful to the economics of Mass General Hospital because they're built for the very major situations.

487
00:48:13,771 --> 00:48:25,315
So that if they wound up with 35 or 40% of relatively minor procedures in all of their beds, that would not, over time, that would not help them continue to invest and grow in what they do.

488
00:48:26,067 --> 00:48:30,747
So it wasn't a case of sending out patients to the community, it was a case of saying to

489
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:40,179
our patients and partners mind, if we were Mass General Hospital of Medford, wouldn't you want to stay in Medford rather than come into Boston?

490
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,722
And the rationale was pretty good, frankly, for that.

491
00:48:44,322 --> 00:48:46,504
The Commonwealth of Massachusetts didn't like that.

492
00:48:46,544 --> 00:48:56,272
The Health Policy Commission said, we're afraid that Mass General's already so big that this will increase their market, and it won't be a competitive situation for everybody else.

493
00:48:56,872 --> 00:49:00,355
We, as you know, had a 20-plus year relationship with Mass General.

494
00:49:00,779 --> 00:49:02,580
We thought it would be the perfect situation.

495
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,622
Commonwealth said, no, you should go out and look at other places.

496
00:49:06,162 --> 00:49:13,166
Interestingly enough for us, we really love the situation we're in right now.

497
00:49:13,686 --> 00:49:14,507
And it was interesting.

498
00:49:14,527 --> 00:49:19,349
We wouldn't have found the situation if we did what we were going to do with partners.

499
00:49:19,709 --> 00:49:25,012
But I would say for all of us, there's more than one solution to a problem lots of times.

500
00:49:25,613 --> 00:49:27,654
And for us, we knew back in 2009, 2010,

501
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:37,963
that we wanted to affiliate with a larger network to fill those gaps, to attract the investment, to build the recruitment.

502
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:44,956
Because we knew that if we didn't, we would fall backwards and eventually we'd come down here and say we can't make a go anymore.

503
00:49:45,597 --> 00:49:48,059
And because you're either getting better or you're getting worse.

504
00:49:48,099 --> 00:49:49,020
We hear it all the time.

505
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,321
We want to keep getting better.

506
00:49:51,002 --> 00:49:53,784
We were not getting better in 2009, in 2010.

507
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,047
And we said we know how we're going to get better.

508
00:49:56,067 --> 00:50:00,391
We're going to team up as the other systems have done around the country.

509
00:50:00,991 --> 00:50:06,053
with a very first-class, world-class organization, which certainly Partners is.

510
00:50:07,054 --> 00:50:15,218
We had a wonderful relationship with Partners, and I think they would have done very nicely for this community, frankly, but it wasn't allowed to go forward.

511
00:50:15,638 --> 00:50:26,823
So we went out and we had 12 proposals from 12 different organizations that came to us, and we settled on this because it has a different

512
00:50:27,553 --> 00:50:35,458
plan, but it has more of our opportunity to influence the future for our organization and our communities.

513
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:42,622
Now, we have a lot of work to do to make it happen, and we can't lean on somebody as we could have leaned a little bit on partners.

514
00:50:43,322 --> 00:50:44,983
We're going to be on our own a little more.

515
00:50:45,784 --> 00:50:52,968
But I can tell you that our team is excited about that, that maybe four or five years ago, we worried, you know, what if we are on our own?

516
00:50:53,468 --> 00:50:54,969
I think now we're excited about it.

517
00:50:55,149 --> 00:50:56,010
I don't say I think.

518
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:56,670
I know we are.

519
00:50:57,337 --> 00:50:59,140
And it's a lot of work.

520
00:50:59,601 --> 00:51:02,145
It's going to take a lot of community support to make it happen.

521
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:05,710
But we want to try and we think that

522
00:51:06,743 --> 00:51:07,283
We'll do it.

523
00:51:07,424 --> 00:51:14,749
And it's a little different than just telling the patients here that like to go to Mass General, stay here because we're not going to be Mass General.

524
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:15,830
We're going to be something else.

525
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,151
But we're going to be pretty good.

526
00:51:18,252 --> 00:51:19,052
We're going to be real good.

527
00:51:19,412 --> 00:51:21,334
And we're going to compete.

528
00:51:21,774 --> 00:51:30,641
And Dr. Torciano, who was here, and a good friend, and I would love to think I'll still be working alongside of him in other ways.

529
00:51:31,661 --> 00:51:33,343
But he and I have said we're going to compete.

530
00:51:34,103 --> 00:51:37,026
And that's what we're going to do.

531
00:51:37,366 --> 00:51:51,018
And we're going to recognize that they're a terrific organization, Partners Healthcare, but we also recognize that Tufts Medical Center is also a terrific organization, and we're going to benefit by that big time.

532
00:51:54,621 --> 00:51:55,843
Mr. McDonald, thank you very much.

533
00:51:55,943 --> 00:51:59,706
I, for one, recognize the value that the hospital has here in our community, not only

534
00:52:00,323 --> 00:52:06,945
for providing quality levels of care, but for also providing jobs that provide a living wage to residents in the city and in the region.

535
00:52:06,965 --> 00:52:16,067
So I thank you for your work and for your efforts in keeping your nose to the grindstone and finding a partnership that the Commonwealth can live with and that will work out for Medford and for Hallmark Health.

536
00:52:16,107 --> 00:52:16,827
So thank you very much.

537
00:52:17,127 --> 00:52:18,107
Councilor Knight, thank you.

538
00:52:18,288 --> 00:52:20,128
We have a fabulous group of employees.

539
00:52:20,168 --> 00:52:20,528
You're right.

540
00:52:20,668 --> 00:52:22,249
And we love them.

541
00:52:22,269 --> 00:52:26,049
They're very dedicated and talented and we want to do well by them.

542
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:28,010
Councilor Felkel.

543
00:52:28,457 --> 00:52:29,638
Thank you, Mr. President.

544
00:52:29,658 --> 00:52:31,239
Thank you, Mr. McDonald, for being here tonight.

545
00:52:31,419 --> 00:52:32,980
And congratulations on the merger.

546
00:52:33,401 --> 00:52:35,482
And thank you for your leadership through the merger.

547
00:52:36,063 --> 00:52:40,246
Any type of a merger is never easy, and leadership is the key.

548
00:52:40,306 --> 00:52:41,386
And I thank you for that.

549
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:49,232
And, you know, as one of my big concerns, I guess, was in Consular, and I had mentioned it was a capital investments.

550
00:52:49,673 --> 00:52:53,976
And it's always good to see or it'd be nice to see.

551
00:52:54,016 --> 00:52:55,697
And I know you don't have any definite plans to

552
00:52:56,078 --> 00:53:02,923
tonight that you can give us, but just to see in the future what your plans are for the campus here at Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

553
00:53:03,343 --> 00:53:06,606
I think that's something that the community's really looking at.

554
00:53:06,926 --> 00:53:12,890
And the Lawrence Memorial Hospital is a valuable asset to this community that has been around, like you said, for almost 100 years.

555
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:17,293
And I'm happy to see that the hospital's here.

556
00:53:17,373 --> 00:53:20,516
It's alive and well.

557
00:53:21,256 --> 00:53:23,818
But capital investment's the big thing for me.

558
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:24,939
I'd love to hear more.

559
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,564
It sounds like you're pretty limited as to what you can say.

560
00:53:28,825 --> 00:53:48,779
We had a plan on the table in 2012 with partners for immediate investment at the Lawrence and a substantial investment at the Lawrence built towards a set of acute care needs but also medical ancillary

561
00:53:49,526 --> 00:54:00,052
services that would go with the overnight acute care needs that fit what I was just saying to Councilor Knight, you know, was part of the Mass General Hospital and Partners plan.

562
00:54:01,022 --> 00:54:22,671
As we look at the opportunity we have and the agreement we have with the welfare folks about capital investment coming to Hallmark Health, we see a similar amount of dollars over time, over the next few years, that will probably be directed at Hallmark Health.

563
00:54:22,711 --> 00:54:26,052
Now, what exactly will direct

564
00:54:26,858 --> 00:54:37,343
towards the Lawrence and towards other facilities that we have in cancer care in Stoneham and clinical in Reading and hospital in Melrose.

565
00:54:37,423 --> 00:54:49,970
We have other things that we will work with the well force leadership on directing, but we still have our own board of trustees, Hallmark Health Board of Trustees, and that will be a big influencer

566
00:54:51,028 --> 00:54:53,530
on the welfare decisions about what we do.

567
00:54:54,331 --> 00:55:06,542
But we have, in this next month, I looked at my calendar, I have nine days of work days in January that I will spend almost exclusively with the welfare people on planning,

568
00:55:07,222 --> 00:55:22,049
and governance issues, and seeking capital investment, not to be spent tomorrow, but the people who might be interested in investing in welfare if they understand us and what our intentions are over the term.

569
00:55:22,669 --> 00:55:28,492
So we will have some of those meetings even this month with people who might be backers, let's say.

570
00:55:30,033 --> 00:55:34,835
But part of attracting the backing is to say, here's what we're

571
00:55:34,835 --> 00:55:39,780
going to do with the money when you lend it to us, because you're going to be interested in that.

572
00:55:40,461 --> 00:55:52,553
And it's going to have to be convincing that when we spend the money, it's going to create the volume and the return on the investment that will pay off the investor and allow us to grow and go out for the

573
00:55:56,535 --> 00:56:02,518
But what the exact use of that money is, is no longer entirely up to Hallmont Health.

574
00:56:02,638 --> 00:56:11,023
It's part of our parent company with us, and that's where we're going to be spending nine of those days in this very month to figure this out.

575
00:56:11,543 --> 00:56:11,983
That's good.

576
00:56:12,303 --> 00:56:15,065
So as far as the branding goes, is it still going to be

577
00:56:15,341 --> 00:56:16,921
going to be Lawrence Memorial Hospital?

578
00:56:17,061 --> 00:56:18,142
What will be the actual?

579
00:56:18,262 --> 00:56:19,062
Very interesting.

580
00:56:19,122 --> 00:56:27,024
We've had, uh, we've had hours of discussion on branding and, uh, uh, we have not reached a resolution on that.

581
00:56:28,084 --> 00:56:37,866
Uh, because those who have been in business as well for us, interestingly enough, well force, which is a name that we haven't really heard very much, but isn't young.

582
00:56:38,026 --> 00:56:38,847
It's only since 2014.

583
00:56:38,887 --> 00:56:38,927
So,

584
00:56:40,764 --> 00:56:51,329
In 2014, Tufts Medical Center and Lowell General Hospital decided to put themselves together to bring more specialty services into Lowell from Tufts Medical Center.

585
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:52,130
And it's worked.

586
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:53,851
We've been very impressed with it.

587
00:56:53,871 --> 00:56:57,693
It was one of the things that brought our attention to this opportunity for us.

588
00:56:58,613 --> 00:57:03,656
And the situation with the

589
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:14,269
with the Wellforce people is they've had two and a half years of using that name and getting their clientele used to the name Wellforce.

590
00:57:14,969 --> 00:57:18,051
So they think that's pretty good and they'd like to use Wellforce some more.

591
00:57:18,432 --> 00:57:19,913
For us, we're brand new to that.

592
00:57:20,013 --> 00:57:31,781
We kind of like the Tufts Medical Center name quite a bit, frankly, especially because the city of Bedford has such a wonderful relationship with people who are Tufts related.

593
00:57:32,642 --> 00:57:34,263
And we're part of that circle.

594
00:57:34,583 --> 00:57:37,886
And so we'd like people to know that we're part of that circle.

595
00:57:37,946 --> 00:57:45,753
And so how do you brand that so that they can see past well for us to see what our relationship is with Tufts Medical Center?

596
00:57:45,793 --> 00:57:53,320
Because we're going to have students, residences from the School of Medicine helping us here over time.

597
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:58,024
We're going to have more to do in our School of Nursing with the Tufts School of Medicine.

598
00:57:58,044 --> 00:58:00,987
And as you know, the School of Nursing at the Lawrence started

599
00:58:01,528 --> 00:58:08,491
On April 1 of 1924, just like Lawrence Memorial started, they started together the same day, School of Nursing and the hospital.

600
00:58:08,991 --> 00:58:14,453
We're going to have help with that School of Nursing for potentially graduate study through the School of Medicine with Tufts.

601
00:58:14,753 --> 00:58:15,233
Fabulous.

602
00:58:15,653 --> 00:58:19,475
We'd like some more identification with that at the time because that's pretty impressive.

603
00:58:20,315 --> 00:58:30,440
So we're having these discussions about branding with the parent that likes well for us, and we don't know how much influence we have yet to get the brand the way we want it.

604
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:33,481
But we're working on it, because we're having a lot of discussion.

605
00:58:33,882 --> 00:58:49,269
And when we look at, for instance, some of our competitors and what they've done, when, for instance, Leahy Hospital, which is now Leahy Health, had Beverly come in, it was some 12 to 15 months before they

606
00:58:49,789 --> 00:58:51,270
had branded Lahey Health.

607
00:58:51,390 --> 00:58:52,832
I mean, they didn't do it right away.

608
00:58:52,872 --> 00:58:59,057
They brought Beverly in and worked on some other things on the North Shore.

609
00:59:00,017 --> 00:59:04,761
And then over time, after discussion, they came up with a little different brand that they kind of liked.

610
00:59:05,782 --> 00:59:10,045
And so we don't feel compelled that we have to this week have the branding.

611
00:59:10,606 --> 00:59:16,791
But we're going to work hard to let the public know with whom we're affiliated and what we're all about.

612
00:59:17,392 --> 00:59:20,296
In a way that I don't think we did very well with Hallmark Health.

613
00:59:20,556 --> 00:59:22,419
I don't think we did a good job with that at all.

614
00:59:22,539 --> 00:59:24,381
It's 19 years that we've been Hallmark Health.

615
00:59:24,782 --> 00:59:33,574
We put ourselves together in 1997 with, in those days, Malden Hospital and Melrose-Wakefield and Witten Hospital in Everett.

616
00:59:34,155 --> 00:59:35,276
And of course, things changed.

617
00:59:35,536 --> 00:59:40,861
Everett's now part of Cambridge Health Alliance, and Baldwin Hospital wouldn't continue, unfortunately.

618
00:59:42,262 --> 00:59:49,128
But we named ourselves Hallmark, and I don't think it really caught on with the public as to what Hallmark really meant.

619
00:59:49,908 --> 00:59:53,431
And that was our fault, and we're trying to do a little better with the next round.

620
00:59:54,452 --> 00:59:59,276
Do you know if there are, so the nursing school actually, it's near and dear to my heart.

621
00:59:59,316 --> 01:00:01,318
My wife actually is a graduate from the nursing school.

622
01:00:01,987 --> 01:00:06,610
Yeah, great program, fabulous program, has produced a lot of fine nurses.

623
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:14,255
And do you know if there are going to be any changes to that or is that kind of just... No, that is still so strong.

624
01:00:14,275 --> 01:00:16,796
The nursing school, we're at capacity.

625
01:00:18,037 --> 01:00:21,499
It's the number one nursing school for placement.

626
01:00:21,579 --> 01:00:26,682
You know, we place the grads, as you know, number one two-year program for placement.

627
01:00:27,042 --> 01:00:30,425
We're now with Regis College, too, for an opportunity for the baccalaureate.

628
01:00:30,465 --> 01:00:32,947
We're going to look into graduate opportunities.

629
01:00:34,568 --> 01:00:35,569
We are at capacity.

630
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:44,156
And we have to determine what we're going to do over time in facilities for the School of Nursing.

631
01:00:44,296 --> 01:00:48,700
But it's a tremendous asset to not just Larmor.

632
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:53,904
It's a tremendous asset to Hallmark Health generally and to the community and to the Commonwealth of Mass.

633
01:00:53,964 --> 01:00:55,885
So we want to keep that going.

634
01:00:56,346 --> 01:00:56,506
Great.

635
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,360
Great job.

636
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:01,722
Uh, if you could keep us updated on, uh, uh, as you get on this road, that would be great.

637
01:01:01,842 --> 01:01:03,983
And thank you for coming before us and happy new year.

638
01:01:04,163 --> 01:01:04,463
Thank you.

639
01:01:07,025 --> 01:01:07,685
Thank you for coming.

640
01:01:07,785 --> 01:01:09,486
And, um, I hope to see you soon.

641
01:01:09,506 --> 01:01:15,628
Uh, with some more news of what's, uh, uh, uh, what's more, more, uh, impending things coming in.

642
01:01:16,429 --> 01:01:16,889
Uh, and again,

643
01:01:17,802 --> 01:01:26,886
A lot of people don't know, aside from being a medical facility, Hallmark has been a great community provider for many organizations and many things in this community.

644
01:01:26,946 --> 01:01:31,828
And I would hope that through this merger, the commitment to the community will stay the same.

645
01:01:32,269 --> 01:01:34,890
Mr. President, it's a privilege to come before this council.

646
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:36,070
Thank you for inviting me.

647
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:37,411
I'd like to come anytime at all.

648
01:01:37,671 --> 01:01:38,371
Thank you very much.

649
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:43,113
Good evening, Mr. President.

650
01:01:43,153 --> 01:01:44,314
Congratulations on your term.

651
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:48,564
My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Saugus Party.

652
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:51,446
On the issue of branding, I'll get to that first.

653
01:01:51,926 --> 01:02:02,490
Alan, maybe just an idea that you can call it the Lawrence Memorial Hospital slash the division of the Welfare, Welforce Group, because I think the community would respect the idea that the merger is taking place.

654
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:03,391
It's a great idea.

655
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:09,393
It's a great place to have an opportunity to move forward, but at the same time, this community knows the hospital is the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

656
01:02:09,885 --> 01:02:14,228
And as a division of welfare, that might be the catalyst to get other communities to be involved.

657
01:02:14,989 --> 01:02:23,075
But my concern is, you folks have all mentioned it, but there's a debt obligation to the Malden Hospital, to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, or Hallmark has.

658
01:02:23,635 --> 01:02:34,683
And there hasn't been any comment as it relates to the fact is how does that debt obligation work when the three hospitals get together and I don't just know if it's a third, I don't know how it's going to be proportioned out.

659
01:02:35,035 --> 01:02:37,596
at who has the majority vote and how the vote's going to take place.

660
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:44,879
But whatever the multi-million dollars that are left on that hospital debt obligation that's needed, how is that going to interact, number one?

661
01:02:44,899 --> 01:02:53,023
And number two, when something needs to take place as far as development, for which all of you folks have talked about the development, who's going to come first in line for it?

662
01:02:53,123 --> 01:02:58,965
I mean, if two hospitals have the same idea, is wellness going to allow both hospitals to do the same thing?

663
01:02:59,045 --> 01:03:02,547
Are you going to split up the types of developments that you're going to have?

664
01:03:02,847 --> 01:03:04,768
And I think that would be beneficial for

665
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:11,941
A, the community to know, but also the doctors, the nurses and the programs that you're going to be having here at the, uh, at the Lawrence.

666
01:03:12,561 --> 01:03:16,743
Um, so with that being said, and I know it's a financial consideration.

667
01:03:17,323 --> 01:03:20,384
The last part of the question would be on an annual basis.

668
01:03:20,404 --> 01:03:21,124
I'm quite sure.

669
01:03:21,725 --> 01:03:26,046
Is this merger independent or is it conclusive of all together?

670
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:27,627
And the profits are split three ways.

671
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:32,989
And then the Lawrence can go on its merry way and take whatever that money is for whatever its purpose is.

672
01:03:33,467 --> 01:03:42,672
I'm assuming, and they would assume, cause you said, um, Mr. McDonald, you said we will be responsible for our own obligations and that's an outstanding obligation.

673
01:03:43,032 --> 01:03:47,975
So I think we need to have, I'd like to have that question answered as a taxpayer in the community.

674
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:54,199
Um, I think it's great that the merger is taking place, but I still think these are a couple of questions that need to be answered.

675
01:03:54,259 --> 01:04:02,203
And I, and I think it would be good for the community to know where we're going because I know it was council Falco has and council Longo current and some members of the council have attended meetings.

676
01:04:02,576 --> 01:04:04,778
as to what's going to be the development of the Malden Hospital.

677
01:04:05,498 --> 01:04:11,663
Once that sale takes place, does that money go into the pot of the kitty or does that go just strictly to the Lawrence Memorial Hospital?

678
01:04:12,164 --> 01:04:16,267
So I would appreciate it through the chair, Mr. President, if Mr. McDonald could answer those questions.

679
01:04:17,188 --> 01:04:19,150
Alan, can you answer Councilor Penter's concerns?

680
01:04:20,631 --> 01:04:21,151
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

681
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:23,793
I'm happy to talk about the finances.

682
01:04:25,715 --> 01:04:29,278
And I know there were a lot of questions there I should have written about as I went.

683
01:04:29,678 --> 01:04:31,640
If I don't, Mr. Penter, if I

684
01:04:33,132 --> 01:04:36,054
Come on back up if I miss one or two of the questions.

685
01:04:37,155 --> 01:04:42,900
I heard the discussion about the Malden Hospital, and we are still obligated on the debt for the Malden Hospital.

686
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:50,146
What happens when you become one obligated group, all the parties are obligated for every debt.

687
01:04:51,086 --> 01:04:56,171
We will go in and borrow money through the parent company to do work at Hallmark Health.

688
01:04:57,532 --> 01:04:59,773
We will be obligated ourselves

689
01:05:00,502 --> 01:05:04,083
It's like a marriage where, you know, both parties are 100 percent obligated.

690
01:05:04,143 --> 01:05:12,026
We'll be obligated to pay back our debt, but Tufts Medical and Lowell General will also be obligated to pay back our debt.

691
01:05:12,866 --> 01:05:21,689
When we merged in 1997 with Malden, Malden at that time had a $30 million debt, long-term debt.

692
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:24,510
They did not have any money, any cash reserves.

693
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:25,870
They had $30 million debt.

694
01:05:26,551 --> 01:05:30,372
And unfortunately, they were losing about $10 million a year in operations.

695
01:05:31,332 --> 01:05:33,954
It was a very difficult situation for them.

696
01:05:34,194 --> 01:05:37,236
In a sense, we thought we could rescue the hospital.

697
01:05:37,476 --> 01:05:59,152
Turned out that it wasn't rescuable because in the balanced budget act changes in 98, 99 at the federal government, the changes in Medicaid, Medicare payment actually reduced our reserves for Hallmark health to where we were about half of cash to long-term debt.

698
01:05:59,172 --> 01:06:00,213
That was the difficulty.

699
01:06:00,816 --> 01:06:01,916
We've built it up over time.

700
01:06:01,977 --> 01:06:04,317
We're now more than twice cash to debt.

701
01:06:04,358 --> 01:06:07,999
We've had a very good buildup over a decade period of time.

702
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:13,481
But we still, while we're paying off Malden, continue to be obligated to pay the Malden debt.

703
01:06:14,122 --> 01:06:24,566
And at this moment, out of that $30 million debt, we still have about $13 million or so that's on the books for Malden that we will pay off over time, no question about it.

704
01:06:25,647 --> 01:06:28,848
And that will be the way it will be for welfare.

705
01:06:29,425 --> 01:06:40,451
When we come in and borrow money, if we get to the situation where we cannot pay our debt, Tufts Medical Center and Lowell will be equally obligated on the debt that we have.

706
01:06:41,271 --> 01:06:43,893
And that's a big move for them, frankly.

707
01:06:45,254 --> 01:06:52,277
And it's one that should give some comfort to this community that we're coming in with people who care as much about the community as we do.

708
01:06:53,098 --> 01:06:53,458
Thank you, Alan.

709
01:07:02,591 --> 01:07:04,172
Mr. McDonald, let's see if he's done.

710
01:07:04,192 --> 01:07:10,136
The question was, will Lawrence Memorial Hospital be a division of Welforce?

711
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:23,465
Actually, the interesting thing is, going back to the branding discussion, we've got Welforce, Hallmark, Circle Health, Tufts Medical Center, Melrose Wakefield Hospital, Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

712
01:07:23,825 --> 01:07:29,549
We've got a lot of brands out there that are running around, and we've got to figure out a way to bring them in so that

713
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:32,865
When you talk about General Electric, you know what you're talking about.

714
01:07:33,965 --> 01:07:41,169
And the fact of the matter is, it's not a division, any more than Lawrence was not a division of Hallmark Health.

715
01:07:41,229 --> 01:07:48,634
When we put the Lawrence together with those other hospitals, we became a financially obligated group as Hallmark.

716
01:07:48,674 --> 01:07:55,898
So we never looked at it as a division of Hallmark, and we don't look at it as a division of Wellforce either.

717
01:07:56,298 --> 01:07:59,520
We're really all one family is what the situation is.

718
01:08:00,478 --> 01:08:03,299
and that's the way we're gonna be trying to make, move it forward.

719
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:04,320
Thank you, Allen.

720
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,040
Thank you.

721
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:07,041
Councilor Knight.

722
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:08,221
Move approval, Mr. President.

723
01:08:08,701 --> 01:08:09,182
All in favor?

724
01:08:09,202 --> 01:08:10,202
Aye.

725
01:08:10,942 --> 01:08:11,443
Allen, thank you.

726
01:08:11,483 --> 01:08:12,603
Hope to see you soon.

727
01:08:14,904 --> 01:08:17,085
All right, moving along.

728
01:08:17,105 --> 01:08:19,266
17006, offered by Councilor Mox.

729
01:08:19,866 --> 01:08:29,590
Whereas the city of Medford, current default speed of 30 miles an hour exists on all city streets where there is no posted speed limit

730
01:08:30,016 --> 01:08:58,798
and whereas state legislature recently voted to allow local municipalities the ability to lower the default speed limit to 25, excuse me, 25 miles per hour on any roadway inside a thickly settled or business district, and whereas reducing the default speed limit from 30 miles an hour to 25 miles an hour gives drivers and pedestrians more reaction time

731
01:08:59,353 --> 01:09:04,156
making our streets safer for walking, driving, and bicycling then.

732
01:09:04,977 --> 01:09:28,433
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council vote to lower the current default speed from 30 miles an hour to 25 miles an hour, and be it further resolved that the city of Medford replace outdated speeding signs with new 25 mile per hour sign citywide and inform the residents of the new default speed limit throughout a widespread

733
01:09:28,885 --> 01:09:30,285
Public Outreach Program.

734
01:09:30,845 --> 01:09:31,666
Councilor Marks.

735
01:09:33,846 --> 01:09:34,846
Thank you, Mr. President.

736
01:09:35,227 --> 01:09:46,389
And I want to recognize Chief Leo Sacco is here tonight, whom I've had a great conversation regarding this very resolution.

737
01:09:47,169 --> 01:09:57,632
Mr. President, I offer this resolution tonight based on the fact that the number one issue, and I think I won't speak for all my colleagues, but the number one issue that I receive

738
01:09:58,503 --> 01:10:02,504
uh, is, uh, pedestrian safety and speeding on our streets.

739
01:10:03,205 --> 01:10:06,306
And it's been an issue for a number of years, uh, in this community.

740
01:10:07,146 --> 01:10:23,731
Uh, this council has made many recommendations for traffic calming initiatives, uh, in the community to address, uh, some of the concerns we have, uh, for people speeding and the fact that, um, pedestrians don't feel safe crossing our roads.

741
01:10:24,322 --> 01:10:27,745
We had a number of incidences in this community of recent.

742
01:10:28,685 --> 01:10:37,191
We had a student that was struck on High Street and a number of other incidences in our community regarding speeding vehicles.

743
01:10:38,032 --> 01:10:41,995
And my opinion, lowering the default speed limit.

744
01:10:42,595 --> 01:10:53,203
And when we refer to default speed limit right now, it's any road that currently doesn't have a speed limit, which is probably a large majority of our roads right now that don't have a speed limit.

745
01:10:53,563 --> 01:10:57,847
So those roads are set by default at 30 miles per hour.

746
01:10:58,527 --> 01:11:04,192
Lowering it to 25, Mr. President, in my opinion, will save lives in this community.

747
01:11:04,993 --> 01:11:06,474
And that's not just lip service.

748
01:11:07,014 --> 01:11:07,775
That is fact.

749
01:11:08,676 --> 01:11:19,225
And lowering the speed limit by five miles an hour doesn't seem like a lot, but it increases the reaction time for both the drivers and pedestrians.

750
01:11:20,065 --> 01:11:21,907
And whatever we can do to

751
01:11:22,617 --> 01:11:32,404
arm not only pedestrians but drivers with additional time to react is a step in the right direction towards making our streets safer, Mr. President.

752
01:11:33,885 --> 01:11:37,708
I have something that I got off of.

753
01:11:37,988 --> 01:11:39,769
It was posted on auto.com.

754
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:42,271
And I thought it was pretty interesting.

755
01:11:42,711 --> 01:11:44,853
And it talks about reaction time.

756
01:11:45,453 --> 01:11:49,716
And if the council would just indulge me for a minute, I think it's pretty interesting.

757
01:11:50,157 --> 01:11:51,177
It says at 25 miles an hour,

758
01:11:52,643 --> 01:12:03,391
which is a common speed limit in urban and residential areas, it may not seem like you're going that fast, but you are going about twice as fast as an average person can run.

759
01:12:04,412 --> 01:12:11,497
Record-setting Olympic runners have managed to reach speed limits around 25 miles per hour, but that is rare.

760
01:12:12,838 --> 01:12:14,179
A hypothetical situation.

761
01:12:14,779 --> 01:12:19,563
A vehicle is traveling 25 miles an hour, and a pedestrian enters the roadway.

762
01:12:20,344 --> 01:12:28,132
It takes two seconds for the driver to see the pedestrian, decide to stop the vehicle, and then press the brake.

763
01:12:29,013 --> 01:12:36,702
That means that before the driver has time to react, the car has continued moving 25 miles an hour for two whole seconds.

764
01:12:37,342 --> 01:12:41,547
The vehicle has moved 55 feet before they can even press the brake.

765
01:12:42,383 --> 01:12:55,113
If the car has an average stopping distance at 25 miles an hour of 30 feet, that means the car will have moved a total of 85 feet down the roadway before it comes to a stop.

766
01:12:56,314 --> 01:13:01,078
That is the length of eight Toyota Camrys, to put it into perspective, parked end to end.

767
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:07,904
Because of the human factor, as speed increases, the stopping distance increases dramatically.

768
01:13:08,584 --> 01:13:12,007
At 30 miles per hour, which is our current default limit,

769
01:13:12,411 --> 01:13:14,212
The stopping distance is much greater.

770
01:13:14,232 --> 01:13:14,813
It's 109 feet.

771
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:15,994
At 35 miles per hour, it goes up to 136 feet.

772
01:13:16,674 --> 01:13:18,196
And you're not really speeding yet.

773
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:32,647
switch up the numbers to a freeway speed, which is roughly 60 miles per hour, and the stopping distance is about 305 feet.

774
01:13:33,267 --> 01:13:35,689
That's the length of an entire football field.

775
01:13:36,270 --> 01:13:46,638
So I think when you put it in perspective, it doesn't sound like a great diminishing of speed, 30 to 25, but it does allow for reaction time for both drivers and pedestrians.

776
01:13:47,279 --> 01:13:50,802
And I know this is an initiative the Chief has spoken about.

777
01:13:51,342 --> 01:13:53,584
I know Officer Brooks in the Traffic Division

778
01:13:54,088 --> 01:13:58,211
is working on something very similar language, Mr. President.

779
01:13:58,651 --> 01:14:01,473
We all know the complaints that we receive from residents.

780
01:14:02,074 --> 01:14:04,195
Our city, between the hour of 7 a.m.

781
01:14:04,676 --> 01:14:09,599
and 9 a.m., and then 4 and 6 p.m., turns into a major cutthroat.

782
01:14:09,939 --> 01:14:23,749
People trying to avoid the 93 traffic traverse through our city at all rates of speed, Mr. President, with total disregards for any residents in this particular city.

783
01:14:24,355 --> 01:14:36,119
So I would ask, Mr. President, that proper notification, once approved, be sent to the residents to let them know that there is a new default speed limit of 25 miles an hour so every resident is aware.

784
01:14:36,779 --> 01:14:39,600
And we can do that through a number of different initiatives.

785
01:14:39,620 --> 01:14:49,144
The reverse 911 we can put up on the city website, and we can also start posting new 25-mile-an-hour signs throughout the community.

786
01:14:49,964 --> 01:14:52,205
And I would also ask, Mr. President, that

787
01:14:53,019 --> 01:14:55,120
uh, this be reviewed by the traffic commission.

788
01:14:55,720 --> 01:15:05,623
I think, uh, where they set the rules and regulations for the roads, although I feel very strongly here tonight that, uh, all we need is a vote of the council to move this forward.

789
01:15:06,003 --> 01:15:12,785
I would recommend that it be sent to the traffic commission for, uh, their review, Mr. President and eventual passing.

790
01:15:13,526 --> 01:15:17,767
And, um, you know, I, I think, uh, this is the time to react.

791
01:15:18,568 --> 01:15:19,988
to this particular issue.

792
01:15:20,888 --> 01:15:28,870
We've promised residents of this community over the years that we were going to implement a pilot program for raised crosswalks.

793
01:15:29,970 --> 01:15:38,371
The mayor, then mayor, Mayor McGlynn, promised a pilot program with three raised crosswalks in the community some three and a half years ago.

794
01:15:38,791 --> 01:15:42,692
We've only installed one so far to date.

795
01:15:43,292 --> 01:15:46,033
So I think this is an important issue.

796
01:15:46,733 --> 01:15:47,973
It's a public safety issue.

797
01:15:48,525 --> 01:15:59,773
It's an issue that impacts every person in this community, not just pedestrians, but cyclists that are riding through our community, and, you know, people riding in their cars.

798
01:16:00,293 --> 01:16:05,897
I have two, from a selfish standpoint, two new drivers in my family alone.

799
01:16:06,637 --> 01:16:10,580
And I can tell you the first thing I tell my children is that speed kills.

800
01:16:11,581 --> 01:16:13,242
And keeping control of your cars

801
01:16:13,664 --> 01:16:14,665
extremely important.

802
01:16:14,985 --> 01:16:20,510
Maintaining proper speed on roadways, uh, is, is very important.

803
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,772
And reaction time is extremely important.

804
01:16:22,812 --> 01:16:29,198
So, uh, I look forward to hearing what my fellow colleagues have to state and also chief Sacco.

805
01:16:29,979 --> 01:16:38,206
Um, the chief law enforcement officer is here tonight and I think we should provide him ample opportunity, uh, Mr. President to address this issue.

806
01:16:38,506 --> 01:16:38,726
Thank you.

807
01:16:39,867 --> 01:16:40,288
Councilman.

808
01:16:40,388 --> 01:16:40,508
Okay.

809
01:16:40,915 --> 01:16:42,676
Thank you, President Carviello.

810
01:16:42,796 --> 01:16:45,737
I want to first thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

811
01:16:45,777 --> 01:16:52,319
It's something that I think a few cities and towns have done it recently and I think it's definitely a good initiative.

812
01:16:53,420 --> 01:17:05,985
The number one complaint I get as a city councilor over my years sitting here is pedestrian safety, school safety with regards to children walking across the street and walking to school.

813
01:17:06,485 --> 01:17:09,426
We've witnessed some near misses and

814
01:17:10,723 --> 01:17:16,126
incidents that we'd rather not talk about tonight, but also just speeding on our streets.

815
01:17:16,506 --> 01:17:20,868
And it's something that we always respond to, and we always bring it up at the council.

816
01:17:20,928 --> 01:17:34,735
And I know, especially as of recent, Sergeant Hartnett and Officer Brooks have been very responsive to the council, and it's a pleasure to get traffic studies forwarded to us.

817
01:17:34,895 --> 01:17:39,517
It's something pretty new for the council, and it's something that I'm

818
01:17:40,102 --> 01:17:41,403
just excited about it.

819
01:17:42,104 --> 01:17:50,630
They definitely are taking a concern and know of the problems and are doing their best to do what they can with a small division, obviously.

820
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:56,315
So on that, there's, I think there's three main things we need to focus on.

821
01:17:56,415 --> 01:18:02,340
Obviously when we do change this and hopefully the traffic commission agrees with this as well as the police department.

822
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:06,864
Um, but I think we do need the public outreach is a major component of this.

823
01:18:06,924 --> 01:18:07,364
We need to,

824
01:18:07,794 --> 01:18:15,639
make sure the citizens of this community realize what the change is and how it's going to impact driving in our community for the better.

825
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:20,663
But definitely a period of notification is important.

826
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:22,984
And I think that's something that we definitely can do.

827
01:18:23,845 --> 01:18:35,493
I also think it's important that we beef up that traffic division, whether it's ask the mayor tonight or we've asked her before to increase personnel in the police department.

828
01:18:35,918 --> 01:18:38,819
But I think enforcement is going to be a huge component of this.

829
01:18:38,879 --> 01:18:45,543
And it's something that's going to not only with the change in the ordinance, but also the change in our streets.

830
01:18:45,923 --> 01:18:52,186
If we can get enforcement, we're going to slow down vehicles and we're going to keep our pedestrians and people driving safer.

831
01:18:52,626 --> 01:19:01,770
So I really like to amend this and ask that not only do we reduce the speed limit, but we ask the mayor to hire additional personnel, especially for the traffic division.

832
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:03,351
It's a number one complaint.

833
01:19:03,698 --> 01:19:18,908
And it's something that needs to be addressed, um, with, and with the help of our new side sergeant and officer Brooks and the traffic commission, I think an additional, um, one, two, Oh, there'll be great three personnel in that division is, would greatly improve the safety in our community.

834
01:19:20,929 --> 01:19:21,749
We can make it a B paper.

835
01:19:21,809 --> 01:19:22,030
Sure.

836
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:30,475
Um, and then while the chief's here and I know he's probably going to address the community and the city council, if we can maybe get an update with regards to,

837
01:19:30,965 --> 01:19:32,946
the movable speed limit signs.

838
01:19:33,046 --> 01:19:36,647
And I know there's one movable stationary speed limit sign.

839
01:19:36,687 --> 01:19:42,030
If we can just kind of get an update, it's something that I've been interested in and I feel that it does deter speeding.

840
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:44,130
And I think it's another component of this.

841
01:19:44,190 --> 01:19:50,253
So if we could maybe get an update in conjunction with whatever, you know, the chief would like to address us, that would be great.

842
01:19:50,733 --> 01:19:51,053
Thank you.

843
01:19:51,794 --> 01:19:52,434
Councilor Falco.

844
01:19:52,814 --> 01:19:53,634
Thank you, Mr. President.

845
01:19:53,694 --> 01:19:56,676
I just wanted to take a minute to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

846
01:19:56,696 --> 01:19:59,997
Uh, I have only been on the council for a year now, but,

847
01:20:00,539 --> 01:20:09,401
majority of the calls that I get and the emails that I get are about traffic congestion, uh, public safety with regard to, um, just, uh, automobiles.

848
01:20:09,921 --> 01:20:11,941
And, um, so I think this is vital.

849
01:20:11,981 --> 01:20:12,841
I think it's important.

850
01:20:13,201 --> 01:20:16,822
Um, it's not only saves lives, it makes sense.

851
01:20:17,022 --> 01:20:17,962
It makes complete sense.

852
01:20:18,002 --> 01:20:19,502
I think it's going to make a difference.

853
01:20:20,343 --> 01:20:28,344
Um, you know, since I've been on the couch, I've been pushing to have community police meetings, uh, moved out into the neighborhoods and we've done that over the last

854
01:20:29,100 --> 01:20:31,241
three months, and we're going to continue that ongoing.

855
01:20:31,501 --> 01:20:38,663
And the common theme that comes up every single meeting, and so far we've met over at the Brooks School, we met at St.

856
01:20:38,723 --> 01:20:46,665
Francis, we met at the Andrews, the common theme that comes up is traffic and congestion and speeding.

857
01:20:47,345 --> 01:20:50,006
And this is definitely a tool that we should be using.

858
01:20:50,066 --> 01:20:51,386
We should be lowering the speed limit.

859
01:20:51,787 --> 01:20:56,528
I think it will go a long way in just, you know,

860
01:20:56,834 --> 01:20:58,494
just having a better public safety.

861
01:20:58,814 --> 01:21:13,418
And, um, so I support this resolution, uh, a hundred percent, um, officer Brooks and, uh, Sergeant Hartnett, uh, have also, um, uh, mentioned this at our, um, subcommittee meetings with guarding the, uh, Malvern hospital, uh, ad hoc subcommittee meeting.

862
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:20,319
Um, they talked about, um, the speed, lowering the speed limit did come up and, uh, but it's, it's, this is a valuable tool.

863
01:21:20,359 --> 01:21:20,959
I, I thank you.

864
01:21:20,979 --> 01:21:22,700
Council Marks are bringing it forward.

865
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,960
I support it wholeheartedly and, uh,

866
01:21:25,353 --> 01:21:32,595
If I also may mention at this point that the next community police meeting is actually tomorrow night at the South Memphis Fire Station at 7 p.m.

867
01:21:33,036 --> 01:21:37,277
And I am sure that we'll be talking a lot about speed limits and traffic as well.

868
01:21:37,357 --> 01:21:38,718
So, and everyone is welcome.

869
01:21:39,118 --> 01:21:41,398
But uh, uh, Councilor Marks, thank you for bringing this forward.

870
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:41,759
Thank you.

871
01:21:42,599 --> 01:21:43,139
Councilor Knight.

872
01:21:43,799 --> 01:21:45,180
Mr. President, thank you very much.

873
01:21:45,900 --> 01:21:45,980
Um,

874
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:51,626
Councilor Marks brings forward a resolution that I don't think anybody behind this rail is going to be opposed to.

875
01:21:51,646 --> 01:21:53,227
It's something that we've discussed in the past.

876
01:21:53,287 --> 01:22:01,413
It's something that we're going to continue discussing to the future because quite frankly, traffic on our streets and speeding on our streets is a significant problem here in the city of Medford.

877
01:22:02,974 --> 01:22:14,143
The legislature and its divine wisdom gave these municipalities back some local control with the passage of this law that would allow us to set the speed limit at 25 miles per hour in areas that aren't posted.

878
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:26,472
But what the legislature also did in this piece of legislation, Mr. President, was they gave the municipality the ability to create local pedestrian safety zones where the speed limit can be 20 miles an hour.

879
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:32,955
And it's for thickly settled business districts, areas abutting fire stations, police stations, parks, and schools.

880
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:39,539
And, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper by putting forward a C paper and asking that the

881
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:49,235
Examination of pedestrian safety zones also be looked at by the Traffic Commission in conjunction with Walker Medford, the Bicycle Commission, and the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. President.

882
01:22:49,695 --> 01:22:59,740
I think it would make sense to have these three entities working together to identify areas that can be designated as pedestrian safety zones, and the speed limit in those areas can be reduced down to 20 miles an hour.

883
01:23:00,700 --> 01:23:01,421
Thank you, Councilor Layton.

884
01:23:03,121 --> 01:23:06,003
Chief Sacco, would you like to add something to the conversation?

885
01:23:07,424 --> 01:23:07,944
I'm sure you would.

886
01:23:08,872 --> 01:23:09,212
Good evening.

887
01:23:09,272 --> 01:23:13,334
Leo Sacco, police chief, uh, resided to 27 Elm street in Medford.

888
01:23:13,895 --> 01:23:16,236
Uh, congratulations on your election as president.

889
01:23:16,256 --> 01:23:16,676
Thank you.

890
01:23:16,756 --> 01:23:20,999
And, uh, counselor Max is vice president and happy new year to all.

891
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:30,644
Uh, as counselor Knight mentioned, I don't think anyone's going to argue about this, uh, speed limit reduction and thick thickly settled districts or business districts.

892
01:23:31,564 --> 01:23:37,968
Uh, back in November, the legislature passed the municipal modernization act, which allowed cities and towns to,

893
01:23:38,595 --> 01:23:40,637
to opt into a couple of chapters.

894
01:23:40,677 --> 01:23:57,789
And that's what we need the council support for is to allow us to opt into the chapter and section that allows us to reduce the speed limit to 25 from 30 and also the safety zones, not just around schools, but around playgrounds, around hospitals, senior centers, uh, any number of areas.

895
01:23:58,109 --> 01:24:02,272
And it would be 20 miles per hour, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

896
01:24:03,093 --> 01:24:08,357
Uh, but, uh, I just respectfully submit that it is within the realm of the traffic commission to have to,

897
01:24:09,154 --> 01:24:10,815
uh, review this and, and to pass it.

898
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:13,335
And I just one member, we have five members.

899
01:24:14,036 --> 01:24:16,836
I think all, uh, all members will be supportive of this.

900
01:24:17,156 --> 01:24:18,757
Uh, it's something that's long overdue.

901
01:24:19,477 --> 01:24:24,619
I've spoken with Suzanne Renford, who is the director of the traffic and parking department in Somerville.

902
01:24:25,419 --> 01:24:31,001
And, uh, she informs me that Somerville jumped on board, uh, prior to this being passed.

903
01:24:31,281 --> 01:24:38,263
And once it was passed, they were able to, uh, enact the legislation and the regulations and signage.

904
01:24:38,670 --> 01:25:01,114
within the city and I think many Medford residents notice now when you drive from a Medford Street, whether it be Medford Street, Main Street, any of the streets that connect with Somerville, they have the big sign almost like a school zone sign saying thickly settled district, 25 miles per hour, pretty much what was stated about default, unless it's on some street that has a posted speed limit.

905
01:25:01,714 --> 01:25:08,435
The one thing that the state legislature did not allow us to do with this is to change the speed limit on state posted

906
01:25:09,456 --> 01:25:14,259
are state-numbered routes, which would be Route 16, Route 28, Route 38.

907
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:24,326
So we can do it on roads that are owned and maintained by the city of Medford, but we can't change the speed limit on state-numbered routes.

908
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:33,812
And you know we have a number of them that pass through the city, but at least if we can control the speed on the streets that feed into those routes, maybe it'll be contagious.

909
01:25:35,093 --> 01:25:37,695
The good thing that's happening with this legislation is

910
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:41,832
Cambridge has adopted it, and Boston has adopted it as well.

911
01:25:42,772 --> 01:25:46,654
They have to wait till they advertise that they've passed this, and then they will post.

912
01:25:46,775 --> 01:25:47,715
Somerville's the first.

913
01:25:48,335 --> 01:25:53,038
But if we are on board with this, then it becomes not just one city doing this.

914
01:25:53,138 --> 01:25:54,479
It's going to be a regional effort.

915
01:25:54,519 --> 01:25:58,501
So hopefully that will gain public participation.

916
01:25:59,401 --> 01:26:03,243
20 miles per hour or 25 miles per hour may sound like it's very slow.

917
01:26:03,764 --> 01:26:07,586
But if you look at some of the traffic that's traveling on these roads, they're doing a lot more than 30.

918
01:26:08,471 --> 01:26:12,254
So we need to do something about that and save lives.

919
01:26:12,315 --> 01:26:13,736
And I won't go through the statistics.

920
01:26:14,657 --> 01:26:16,478
Vice President Max already went through that.

921
01:26:17,599 --> 01:26:18,360
It's common sense.

922
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:20,722
You slow down, you'll save lives.

923
01:26:21,483 --> 01:26:23,264
And that's what we're looking to accomplish.

924
01:26:23,865 --> 01:26:29,270
But the one concern that I have, and Councilor Longo-Kern brought it up, was personnel.

925
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:30,291
And we do need personnel.

926
01:26:30,311 --> 01:26:31,592
But we also need the equipment.

927
01:26:31,632 --> 01:26:35,115
I know she wants an update on the signboards or the radar trailer.

928
01:26:35,748 --> 01:26:38,248
We haven't been able to move on that just yet.

929
01:26:38,288 --> 01:26:39,809
We're looking forward to move on.

930
01:26:39,849 --> 01:26:47,930
We've had several other issues that jumped to the forefront, but we need the personnel, we need the equipment and radar equipment.

931
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:50,430
We're using some antique pieces out there.

932
01:26:50,450 --> 01:26:55,991
They're certified, they're calibrated, they still work, but we do need the equipment.

933
01:26:58,292 --> 01:27:03,333
In the last two years, I believe, if the numbers are correct, we brought in $150,000 each year

934
01:27:06,148 --> 01:27:12,613
uh, into the city coffers over the past two years, 2015 and 2016, the numbers aren't complete for 16.

935
01:27:12,813 --> 01:27:25,962
Uh, but with that funding, say 300,000 that came in, if a small portion of that could be dedicated back to equipment would be, uh, a big help to all of us in the police department.

936
01:27:26,022 --> 01:27:29,004
So I just tossed that out there for your consideration.

937
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:35,309
Uh, and that's really an avenue we need to, to look at and to go forward on.

938
01:27:36,573 --> 01:27:47,537
and I'm here for any questions, but I strongly as the police chief strongly support this legislation and this resolution and ask that the council opt into those chapters and sections.

939
01:27:47,597 --> 01:27:49,117
I believe it's 90 17 C and 90 18 B. Okay.

940
01:27:49,137 --> 01:27:49,958
Okay.

941
01:27:59,817 --> 01:28:01,437
Thank you, President Carviello.

942
01:28:02,018 --> 01:28:06,699
If I could ask you a question, you haven't moved on fixing the speed monitor sign that was broken?

943
01:28:07,599 --> 01:28:08,359
We've looked at it.

944
01:28:08,399 --> 01:28:10,120
We've had someone look at it.

945
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:13,081
We're waiting to hear back whether it's repairable.

946
01:28:14,301 --> 01:28:15,821
And then I could be wrong.

947
01:28:15,841 --> 01:28:18,902
We are in line to purchase two new monitors.

948
01:28:18,942 --> 01:28:22,263
Yeah, we did approve funding for that about six months ago.

949
01:28:22,703 --> 01:28:24,784
Right, that has not happened as yet.

950
01:28:24,844 --> 01:28:26,064
It will happen before the spring.

951
01:28:26,744 --> 01:28:29,045
The problem is we're concerned about putting those out there.

952
01:28:29,664 --> 01:28:33,227
inclement weather and have someone skid into them or something like that.

953
01:28:33,287 --> 01:28:40,834
So, uh, but it is working in Somerville and I'm told that the Somerville traffic and parking, they move their radar trailers around regularly.

954
01:28:40,914 --> 01:28:47,820
And, uh, the big thing with that is neighbors get to see exactly the speed of the traffic on their roadways.

955
01:28:48,481 --> 01:28:56,208
And chief, if I may through the, through the chair, if I could amend this as well, whether it's with my B paper or D paper,

956
01:28:56,688 --> 01:29:10,781
If we could just get an update, if you could go back and look and let us know how many pieces of radar equipment you have and how old they are, and maybe just a couple lines on, you know, how we should update them and how much it would cost, and something maybe we could advocate for you.

957
01:29:11,021 --> 01:29:18,168
We keep pushing for, you know, enforcement, but obviously you need the people to do it and the tools to do it.

958
01:29:18,348 --> 01:29:21,331
I mean, how far back are we talking?

959
01:29:21,371 --> 01:29:22,352
How outdated are these?

960
01:29:22,898 --> 01:29:24,219
Radar pieces of radar.

961
01:29:24,279 --> 01:29:26,480
They're old, but like I said, they are calibrated.

962
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:31,164
They are accurate, but they're old pieces that could be problematic.

963
01:29:31,664 --> 01:29:34,526
We do need later and greater technology.

964
01:29:35,006 --> 01:29:35,206
Yeah.

965
01:29:35,226 --> 01:29:43,972
If we could get, um, just get that in writing of how old the pieces of radar are and how many we have and how we, you know, the cost of upgrading.

966
01:29:44,413 --> 01:29:45,193
That'll be a deep paper.

967
01:29:47,475 --> 01:29:50,717
And chief, I would hope you'll have this on the agenda for the January.

968
01:29:51,391 --> 01:29:52,292
for us.

969
01:29:52,712 --> 01:29:55,333
That's the plan at this point.

970
01:29:56,534 --> 01:29:57,094
Councilor Marks.

971
01:29:58,275 --> 01:29:59,256
Thank you, Mr. President.

972
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:09,522
And Chief Sacco brings up a very valid point that over the past two years, the men and women of our police department have written over $300,000

973
01:30:11,853 --> 01:30:13,394
of citations, is that correct, Chief?

974
01:30:13,815 --> 01:30:14,896
In that area.

975
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:17,218
It may not be the exact number, but very close.

976
01:30:17,238 --> 01:30:18,739
Strictly for move-in violations?

977
01:30:18,779 --> 01:30:19,640
Move-in violations.

978
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,801
For move-in violations.

979
01:30:21,522 --> 01:30:38,977
And it's, you know, it's very important to have a dedicated revenue stream to increase the equipment and provide updated equipment to our law enforcement, as well as the fire department, Mr. President, as we all know.

980
01:30:39,682 --> 01:30:48,947
and not to have a dedicated revenue stream because the budget clearly is not doing its purpose of revamping and replacing equipment.

981
01:30:49,247 --> 01:30:53,810
And that goes from police cars on down to radar to electric speeding signs.

982
01:30:54,430 --> 01:30:55,571
It runs the whole gambit.

983
01:30:56,231 --> 01:31:03,935
And I think it's only appropriate that we as a council send a message to the mayor that the mayor create an earmark that

984
01:31:04,391 --> 01:31:14,473
a percentage of the revenue that's generated by the police department be earmarked back to the police department for the purpose of updating equipment.

985
01:31:15,033 --> 01:31:23,855
And that way you'll have a dedicated stream of revenue that we don't have to wonder each year if the chief has enough revenue to keep up with the equipment needs.

986
01:31:24,535 --> 01:31:33,537
And I'll throw out a figure of 25%, so 25% be earmarked to the police department of the ticketing revenue

987
01:31:34,329 --> 01:31:36,730
Mr. President, back to the police department.

988
01:31:37,010 --> 01:31:44,152
And I would offer that as an e-paper, Mr. President, that we have a dedicated revenue source.

989
01:31:44,852 --> 01:31:59,576
You know, this is not an issue that we — this is a very serious issue that men in police — police men and women have the ability to perform their jobs and be presented with state-of-the-art equipment.

990
01:32:00,416 --> 01:32:03,737
And I, for one, don't think that's currently happening right now.

991
01:32:04,448 --> 01:32:11,334
and hope that, uh, an air mock, uh, to the police department would, uh, alleviate the concerns that we are having.

992
01:32:12,194 --> 01:32:13,095
Thank you, Mr. President.

993
01:32:14,936 --> 01:32:15,237
Thank you.

994
01:32:15,297 --> 01:32:16,738
Counsel locks chief.

995
01:32:16,778 --> 01:32:17,739
You have anything else you want to add?

996
01:32:18,059 --> 01:32:18,419
That's it.

997
01:32:18,759 --> 01:32:19,100
Okay.

998
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:22,302
Well, okay.

999
01:32:22,522 --> 01:32:27,006
Uh, Mr. Clark, um, we haven't, we have a regular motion.

1000
01:32:27,046 --> 01:32:27,827
We have a B paper.

1001
01:32:27,847 --> 01:32:30,629
We have a C paper of a D paper and we have an E paper.

1002
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,861
Mr. Clerk, if you want to, we'll start with the e-paper, if you want to read it back so everybody knows what it is.

1003
01:32:36,201 --> 01:32:47,324
The e-paper is, obviously, Councilor Marks is creating a earmarked percentage of ticket revenue to be directed to police equipment.

1004
01:32:50,305 --> 01:32:50,925
In particular, 25%.

1005
01:32:51,026 --> 01:32:50,925
25%.

1006
01:32:51,046 --> 01:32:58,328
Directed back to the police department in the form of an amount for the purpose of updating equipment.

1007
01:33:00,893 --> 01:33:04,155
Okay, Councillor Marks' motion on the E paper.

1008
01:33:04,536 --> 01:33:05,096
All in favour?

1009
01:33:05,536 --> 01:33:05,636
Aye.

1010
01:33:06,297 --> 01:33:06,737
All opposed?

1011
01:33:06,977 --> 01:33:08,959
Hearing and seeing none, motion passes 7-0.

1012
01:33:08,999 --> 01:33:13,242
On the D paper, Mr. Clerk, if you could read that back.

1013
01:33:13,762 --> 01:33:15,723
Is it the D paper or the B paper?

1014
01:33:15,823 --> 01:33:29,673
The D. Because the D paper is, Councillor, it's an update on the radar equipment, how many there are, what needs to be repaired and cost of upgrade.

1015
01:33:31,540 --> 01:33:34,882
On the motion on the D paper, all in favor?

1016
01:33:35,802 --> 01:33:36,182
Opposed?

1017
01:33:36,222 --> 01:33:39,224
Hearing and seeing none, motion passes 7-0.

1018
01:33:39,764 --> 01:33:42,165
Mr. Clerk, if you could read back the C paper.

1019
01:33:42,566 --> 01:33:53,231
C paper, I believe is Councilor Knight, and that would be... That's Councilor Knight.

1020
01:33:53,371 --> 01:33:56,933
Referring to the safety zones, right?

1021
01:33:57,073 --> 01:33:59,614
Safety zones and traffic...

1022
01:34:00,388 --> 01:34:13,112
Traffic Division, Traffic Commission to review the legislation on safety zones and to work with the... The Traffic Commission, Walkman for the Bicycle Commission and the Chamber of Commerce.

1023
01:34:13,952 --> 01:34:17,793
Work to identify... All in favor of the C motion?

1024
01:34:19,914 --> 01:34:20,434
Opposed?

1025
01:34:21,094 --> 01:34:22,315
Motion passes 7-0.

1026
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:25,916
On the B paper offered by Councilor Langlois-Grant.

1027
01:34:26,296 --> 01:34:29,997
It's hiring additional personnel for the Traffic Division.

1028
01:34:30,783 --> 01:34:35,126
All in favor of the B paper offered by council along the current post done.

1029
01:34:35,586 --> 01:34:41,470
Motion passes seven zero and on the original motion by council marks.

1030
01:34:41,490 --> 01:34:49,515
Mr. President, if I can just add council marks because I think we have to be specific in the language.

1031
01:34:49,555 --> 01:34:56,399
My language was to send it to the traffic commission, but I'd also ask my colleagues to vote on the acceptance of a chapter 90 section 17 C and 18 B. Okay.

1032
01:35:01,833 --> 01:35:03,775
as well as sending it to the traffic commission.

1033
01:35:03,795 --> 01:35:04,075
Okay.

1034
01:35:04,355 --> 01:35:11,221
So this is a, this is only right for one motion.

1035
01:35:11,301 --> 01:35:26,193
Um, I'm wondering if the traffic commission would be required to adopt those sections first and then bring it to the council or whether or not the council adopts those sessions, those, those sections first and then sends it to the traffic commission.

1036
01:35:26,433 --> 01:35:29,776
Um, procedurally, I wonder what the appropriate fashion solicitor, could you give us some guidance here?

1037
01:35:33,121 --> 01:35:34,182
Good evening, Mr. President.

1038
01:35:34,222 --> 01:35:35,002
Congratulations.

1039
01:35:35,022 --> 01:35:35,262
Thank you.

1040
01:35:35,542 --> 01:35:36,463
My name is Mark Romley.

1041
01:35:36,503 --> 01:35:37,424
I'm the city solicitor.

1042
01:35:37,464 --> 01:35:41,586
I reside at 50 Woodrow Avenue in Medford because of the nature of this statute.

1043
01:35:41,606 --> 01:35:53,995
It's a little bit unique as to the acceptance, but I think the preferable way is to have the council accepted first and then refer it to the traffic commission for its discernment and ostensibly its passage.

1044
01:35:54,335 --> 01:35:59,458
And the reason I say that is if we flipped it over and went the other way, there's something incongruous about it.

1045
01:35:59,818 --> 01:36:00,459
You'd have the,

1046
01:36:01,361 --> 01:36:08,186
entity that has jurisdiction over the roadways, the Traffic Commission, accepting it, and then referring it back to you for acceptance.

1047
01:36:09,067 --> 01:36:10,067
It's like two negatives.

1048
01:36:10,768 --> 01:36:14,651
So I think this is the cleaner and more appropriate way to go jurisdictionally.

1049
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:16,472
Thank you, Mr. Solisa.

1050
01:36:16,512 --> 01:36:26,459
All right, so on the original motion by Councilor Max, seconded by Councilor Longo Kern, roll call vote has been requested.

1051
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,881
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1052
01:36:35,334 --> 01:36:36,235
Councilor DelaRusso?

1053
01:36:36,715 --> 01:36:36,995
Yes.

1054
01:36:37,536 --> 01:36:38,296
Councilor Falco?

1055
01:36:38,456 --> 01:36:38,616
Yes.

1056
01:36:39,137 --> 01:36:39,677
Councilor Knight?

1057
01:36:39,937 --> 01:36:40,218
Yes.

1058
01:36:40,718 --> 01:36:41,399
Councilor Longo Kern?

1059
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:41,499
Yes.

1060
01:36:42,359 --> 01:36:43,180
Vice President Marks?

1061
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:43,760
Yes.

1062
01:36:44,041 --> 01:36:44,701
Councilor Scott Pelli?

1063
01:36:44,741 --> 01:36:44,821
Yes.

1064
01:36:45,462 --> 01:36:46,182
President Cavioli?

1065
01:36:46,622 --> 01:36:46,923
Yes.

1066
01:36:47,543 --> 01:36:51,866
And the motion, vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, motion passes.

1067
01:36:52,087 --> 01:36:58,291
Chief, we'll look forward to seeing you on the traffic commission with these resolutions.

1068
01:36:58,311 --> 01:37:00,593
1-7007, offered by Councilor Longo Kern.

1069
01:37:03,867 --> 01:37:12,655
be it resolved that the Medford City Council go on record supporting the prohibition of the issuance of use variances in the city of Medford.

1070
01:37:12,735 --> 01:37:29,990
Before I yield the floor to Councilor Longo Kern, for those of you who don't know what a use variance is, the solicitor was gracious enough to give it to me and it says, a use variance allows the owner of the property to use his property in a way

1071
01:37:30,799 --> 01:37:34,000
that deviates from local zoning standards.

1072
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:40,761
It is an exemption to the zoning regulations governing the use of the property.

1073
01:37:40,801 --> 01:37:46,962
For example, a use variance might allow a commercial use to take place in a residential district.

1074
01:37:47,622 --> 01:37:50,183
So for those of you who didn't know what it was, now we know.

1075
01:37:50,723 --> 01:37:51,743
Councilor Longo-Kern.

1076
01:37:53,244 --> 01:37:55,304
Thank you, President Caravaglio.

1077
01:37:55,324 --> 01:38:00,565
I put this on, I think it's something that the council definitely needs to discuss, whether it be

1078
01:38:01,059 --> 01:38:03,300
you know, fully tonight or in a subcommittee meeting.

1079
01:38:04,661 --> 01:38:16,426
The last time use variances were voted on was before, obviously, I think the longest serving right now, Councilor Marks and I, and we've never taken a vote with regards to use variances.

1080
01:38:16,906 --> 01:38:24,530
And I think it's an important topic now, more than ever, due to the major development going on in our community.

1081
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:29,092
Use variances have been issued, whether or not that's,

1082
01:38:30,504 --> 01:38:36,747
have been legal depends on, I guess, your interpretation of our ordinances.

1083
01:38:37,067 --> 01:38:40,748
But I think it's definitely a topic that needs to be discussed among this council.

1084
01:38:41,188 --> 01:38:48,691
And I think it's a topic that needs to be addressed by the administration in conjunction with this council as well.

1085
01:38:48,751 --> 01:38:58,535
I think we're on showing from what's taken place on the council floor in the last six to nine months, it seems as if

1086
01:38:59,038 --> 01:39:04,002
we're not on the same page and I think we need to, it's time to get on the same page.

1087
01:39:04,042 --> 01:39:21,394
We have a number of units, 500 units that are coming online very shortly with regards to apartments and we need to decide where the vision is and what type of growth we want in our community and I think we need to sit down with the mayor to discuss that.

1088
01:39:22,115 --> 01:39:24,737
I'm sure my colleagues are in agreement with that.

1089
01:39:27,853 --> 01:39:31,674
a use variance in the development that has been going on.

1090
01:39:31,754 --> 01:39:36,956
It's impacting our streets, our sidewalks, traffic, the environment.

1091
01:39:37,456 --> 01:39:41,357
It's impacting parking in our schools, and it's something that needs to be discussed.

1092
01:39:42,377 --> 01:39:49,399
And I hope my council colleagues will realize the importance of this discussion that needs to be had.

1093
01:39:49,559 --> 01:39:53,300
And, you know, I, for one, would like to prohibit the use variance.

1094
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:55,301
I think it needs to be seen by another body.

1095
01:39:55,964 --> 01:39:57,625
An ordinance can always be changed back.

1096
01:39:58,165 --> 01:40:01,846
Somewhere like station landing can always come back to the council.

1097
01:40:01,866 --> 01:40:11,710
But I think another body needs to have a set of eyes on something so significant that has caused a number of controversy in the city.

1098
01:40:11,890 --> 01:40:19,433
But I would ask my colleagues to support it, whether we do it now or we sit in committee of the whole and invite the mayor to sit down with us.

1099
01:40:19,874 --> 01:40:25,676
It's something that needs to be discussed, and it needs to be discussed sooner than later so that we know where we're going in the future.

1100
01:40:26,802 --> 01:40:28,223
Thank you.

1101
01:40:28,703 --> 01:40:32,325
I yelled to a city solicitor.

1102
01:40:32,525 --> 01:40:33,566
I thank you, Mr. President.

1103
01:40:33,586 --> 01:40:34,506
And I'll be very brief.

1104
01:40:34,967 --> 01:40:45,692
I'm very glad that this came up again tonight as it did once a few months back and whatever the council does with a use variances or recommendations going forward is always up to the council.

1105
01:40:45,712 --> 01:40:52,576
That's a legislative decision, but I wanted to make it very clear that in the, the status of our zoning ordinances,

1106
01:40:53,713 --> 01:40:55,373
from the beginning right through today.

1107
01:40:55,453 --> 01:40:59,714
There is no prohibition on a use variance in our ordinances.

1108
01:40:59,754 --> 01:41:04,316
There hasn't been, even though there was some discussion about that some months ago.

1109
01:41:04,376 --> 01:41:05,716
So I wanted to be clear about that.

1110
01:41:06,316 --> 01:41:13,998
The reason I'd say that is when you look at this and you discern whether or not it's a good idea or a bad idea, that's within your province as a legislative body.

1111
01:41:14,518 --> 01:41:22,500
But if there's going to be a change in the zoning ordinance, it would have to go through the normal steps from you as a launching pad to the Community Development Board

1112
01:41:22,968 --> 01:41:26,089
back to you the way that other amendments to the zoning ordinance go.

1113
01:41:26,529 --> 01:41:46,612
But I wanted to be emphatic about, uh, the fact that because there had been some discussion about whether or not use variances are prohibited under our ordinances, our zoning ordinance, the answer to that, I would say emphatically etch it in granite is they are not prohibited, but whether you do so in the future is entirely up to the legislative process.

1114
01:41:47,252 --> 01:41:49,313
Thank you, Mr. Councillor Scott.

1115
01:41:49,693 --> 01:41:50,613
Thank you, Mr. President.

1116
01:41:50,733 --> 01:41:50,773
Uh,

1117
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:59,963
Again, I think this is a topic conversation that I think that with traffic and safety is one of our biggest issues.

1118
01:42:00,043 --> 01:42:04,525
So I appreciate fellow counselor Brianna Longo-Kern bringing this forward.

1119
01:42:06,006 --> 01:42:17,450
But I think this is just a smaller picture of what we're looking at as a body of our ordinances that haven't been looked at in over 30 years.

1120
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:19,171
I know that I mentioned in the past,

1121
01:42:20,578 --> 01:42:45,442
something that will not cost the city money is to really ask our partners and the metro area planning council to come in with us and just to revisit and get more of an idea of what we're, what we're talking about and what we're, what direction we're moving into and give us a better idea and how long, how our ordinances have been in place and whether they need to be moved on.

1122
01:42:45,542 --> 01:42:45,642
So,

1123
01:42:46,275 --> 01:42:55,718
I think this is definitely a big picture, but it's something that I'd like to see as, if we can, to move to subcommittee, committee of the whole meeting.

1124
01:42:56,098 --> 01:43:10,902
We could talk about these issues in more of a, as a whole, not in pieces, but with the administration looking to see where our view, our vision is as we move forward in this community.

1125
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:24,665
I know what the administration has been trying to do with Method Square and doing some great things there, but I think that there is some confusion in what direction we want to go into.

1126
01:43:24,705 --> 01:43:35,590
So if we can, I'd rather see this move to Committee of the Whole meeting and ask our partners in the Metro Area Planning Council to give us some guides.

1127
01:43:35,610 --> 01:43:40,892
I know we use them now in multiple areas and they're here and we've

1128
01:43:41,360 --> 01:43:50,824
already paid for their services and that's what maybe getting some guidance with their expertise and, um, and also our vision with what we're doing.

1129
01:43:50,885 --> 01:43:58,448
So again, if we can, um, my, my recommendation is really going to look to either move this to a subcommittee or committee of the whole meeting.

1130
01:43:58,828 --> 01:44:02,710
We could talk about this in depth before I put a vote yes or no to this.

1131
01:44:02,750 --> 01:44:03,310
So thank you.

1132
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:03,911
Thank you.

1133
01:44:04,751 --> 01:44:05,271
Counselor Knight.

1134
01:44:05,832 --> 01:44:07,152
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1135
01:44:07,172 --> 01:44:11,054
I think that the issue of zoning is a very important issue here in the city of Medford.

1136
01:44:11,936 --> 01:44:17,239
I, for one, am not in favor of eliminating a use zone, a use variance.

1137
01:44:17,379 --> 01:44:24,182
Personally, myself, I think that it's going to hinder our ability to attract good businesses and to develop parcels that are underdeveloped or underutilized.

1138
01:44:24,962 --> 01:44:27,843
However, I think that Councillor Longo makes a great point.

1139
01:44:28,544 --> 01:44:32,485
We need to be in the same room with the administration to talk about a vision for the city and what direction we're going to go in.

1140
01:44:32,505 --> 01:44:36,067
And I think Councillor Scarpelli makes a great point as well.

1141
01:44:37,047 --> 01:44:40,809
We can bring in the Massachusetts Area Planning Council to come in and to talk to us about

1142
01:44:41,132 --> 01:44:42,072
what steps we can take.

1143
01:44:42,533 --> 01:44:46,294
But the first foundation of this is going to be to develop that vision.

1144
01:44:46,314 --> 01:44:50,976
And I don't think that that vision is going to be developed without us first sitting down with the administration, Mr. President.

1145
01:44:51,816 --> 01:45:00,099
So I would motion to have this paper referred to the Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations, where we can set up a meeting with the administration to talk about our vision for development here in the community.

1146
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:03,981
We can have the subcommittee generate some questions for the administration and report them back to the council.

1147
01:45:04,001 --> 01:45:05,081
Intergovernmental Relations?

1148
01:45:06,922 --> 01:45:09,203
That was a subcommittee that was established by Councilor Camuso.

1149
01:45:14,676 --> 01:45:16,717
And then we can start the discussion, Mr. President.

1150
01:45:17,237 --> 01:45:19,498
You go to the subcommittee on intergovernmental relations.

1151
01:45:19,518 --> 01:45:20,539
We have some questions that are asked.

1152
01:45:20,559 --> 01:45:22,400
We have some foundation documents that are produced.

1153
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:25,561
Those foundation documents can be reported out to the committee in the hall.

1154
01:45:25,901 --> 01:45:27,001
The committee in the hall can sit down.

1155
01:45:27,021 --> 01:45:28,342
We can review the documents that we have.

1156
01:45:28,362 --> 01:45:30,543
And now we have a launching pad and a jump off, Mr. President.

1157
01:45:30,563 --> 01:45:34,365
So that's the course of action that I recommend, and I appreciate you providing me the floor.

1158
01:45:38,631 --> 01:45:46,233
Mr. President, I would concur with the council who suggests that it should go to subcommittee and engage the principle of subsidiarity.

1159
01:45:46,833 --> 01:45:56,996
Secondly, I'd caution against an overdue, uh, dependence upon the metropolitan area planning council, whereas their interests are metropolitan.

1160
01:45:57,016 --> 01:46:00,417
Uh, I'm concerned with the city of Medford.

1161
01:46:01,137 --> 01:46:01,997
Thank you, Mr. President.

1162
01:46:02,017 --> 01:46:03,517
Thank you.

1163
01:46:03,737 --> 01:46:04,698
Thank you, Mr. President.

1164
01:46:04,878 --> 01:46:05,658
And, uh,

1165
01:46:06,600 --> 01:46:17,806
I'd like to begin by saying I think that this should be moved to Committee of the Whole, and the reason why, if we're gonna be talking about the mayor's vision for this city, and the vision for economic development, and zoning, we should all be at the table.

1166
01:46:18,627 --> 01:46:22,349
This is a Committee of the Whole topic as far as I'm concerned.

1167
01:46:22,489 --> 01:46:23,910
I think zoning is a huge issue.

1168
01:46:23,950 --> 01:46:26,431
Zoning has not been looked at in 30 to 40 years.

1169
01:46:27,012 --> 01:46:31,174
I had a resolution last year saying that we should bring in someone from the outside to look at it.

1170
01:46:31,554 --> 01:46:32,295
Will it cost money?

1171
01:46:32,335 --> 01:46:34,256
Yes, but it needs to be looked at.

1172
01:46:34,336 --> 01:46:36,257
It hasn't been looked at in far too long.

1173
01:46:38,296 --> 01:46:46,500
I understand where you're coming from, Councilor Longo, by bringing this forward tonight, but I think it does need more discussion, without a doubt.

1174
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:54,044
If I could amend the resolution, if we could get some, I'd like to know how many, over the past 25 years, how many use variances have been granted?

1175
01:46:54,224 --> 01:46:57,566
I can give you some, a little bit of guidance there.

1176
01:46:58,367 --> 01:47:05,831
Over the last, I did ask the building commissioner to go back, and he went back to,

1177
01:47:07,272 --> 01:47:13,716
2006, and there were 27 issued going back to 2006.

1178
01:47:13,816 --> 01:47:15,677
27 issued?

1179
01:47:15,697 --> 01:47:16,738
27 were issued.

1180
01:47:17,198 --> 01:47:18,038
Uh, some were small.

1181
01:47:18,098 --> 01:47:22,781
Somebody else, uh, he gave me, uh, if Larry were here, I could, I could get everybody a copy.

1182
01:47:23,561 --> 01:47:32,946
Uh, but, uh, he gave me the addresses, uh, that they were given to some are just, you know, like on houses and, you know, smaller things and some pertain to larger projects.

1183
01:47:33,547 --> 01:47:34,107
Um, I will,

1184
01:47:35,639 --> 01:47:38,740
I will get a copy and send it out to everybody.

1185
01:47:39,621 --> 01:47:42,162
Uh, so that's, that is a number of going back 10 years.

1186
01:47:42,262 --> 01:47:43,923
Let's go back 10 years and he's 27, 27.

1187
01:47:44,743 --> 01:47:50,846
And how many, if you don't mind me asking, do you know how many of those are like major, like economic development related?

1188
01:47:50,866 --> 01:47:59,350
Um, uh, mystic Valley Parkway, 37 a mystic Valley Parkway, 24 a Boston Avenue was probably a bigger one.

1189
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:03,832
Um, say three 66 Salem street,

1190
01:48:04,577 --> 01:48:16,240
Let's say a lot of them are just, you know, a little, middle six ave, you know, some of them are small, some of them, you know, it doesn't say exactly what was done on them, but they do have addresses here.

1191
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:28,022
Because if we could get, if we could go back 20 years, just because I want to see with regard to economic development, what's the impact of these variances?

1192
01:48:28,082 --> 01:48:30,222
What are they, you know, what's being approved?

1193
01:48:30,242 --> 01:48:32,363
I mean, we should be looking at that.

1194
01:48:33,382 --> 01:48:34,102
get 20 years.

1195
01:48:34,122 --> 01:48:38,443
It'd be great to see the 10 years, but I want to see, I'm assuming a lot of that small stuff.

1196
01:48:38,703 --> 01:48:47,966
And if we're talking about economic development, I want to see the big projects that have been approved and then we can look at those and say, okay, what is it been the impact of these use variances that have been approved?

1197
01:48:47,986 --> 01:48:49,406
Do you want to make that motion?

1198
01:48:49,506 --> 01:48:50,026
If I could, yes.

1199
01:48:50,046 --> 01:48:55,708
And I can amend the resolution to the building commissioner can go back 20 years instead of the 10 that he already gave me.

1200
01:48:55,768 --> 01:48:56,048
Please.

1201
01:48:56,068 --> 01:48:57,488
Okay.

1202
01:48:57,908 --> 01:48:58,208
Thank you.

1203
01:48:59,749 --> 01:48:59,989
Another 10.

1204
01:49:02,488 --> 01:49:03,129
Councilor Knight.

1205
01:49:03,909 --> 01:49:10,054
And I, for one, Mr. President, you know, feel as though we do need to review zoning, but we need to review zoning to accomplish a purpose.

1206
01:49:10,254 --> 01:49:11,175
So what are we looking at it for?

1207
01:49:11,195 --> 01:49:15,098
If we're going to bring in outside agencies and outside entities and spend money, we need to have a goal.

1208
01:49:15,138 --> 01:49:19,582
We need to have some sort of a prize in the sky that we're shooting for that we want to attain.

1209
01:49:19,942 --> 01:49:21,604
Not just, it hasn't been looked at, so look at it.

1210
01:49:21,944 --> 01:49:25,067
It has to be, okay, these are the goals that were set out to accomplish.

1211
01:49:25,427 --> 01:49:26,508
What steps do we need to take?

1212
01:49:26,548 --> 01:49:28,770
And can you provide us with the technical assistance to get there?

1213
01:49:29,450 --> 01:49:31,532
I think we need to share the mayor's vision also.

1214
01:49:32,057 --> 01:49:36,762
So we know what, uh, uh, what direction they're going and also my rest is present.

1215
01:49:37,462 --> 01:49:38,003
Also marks.

1216
01:49:39,144 --> 01:49:40,105
Thank you, Mr. President.

1217
01:49:40,145 --> 01:49:50,014
I agree with councilor Falco and council one go current that this is far too important of an issue to be in subcommittee and deserves the full weight of this council and the committee of the whole meeting.

1218
01:49:50,615 --> 01:49:55,660
Uh, I would also say, Mr. President, uh, that, uh, this council, as we hear over and over again,

1219
01:49:56,437 --> 01:49:59,019
has very little authority and little teeth.

1220
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:12,847
And, you know, one of the big important roles of this council is the setting of the city budget and also zoning, which as I mentioned earlier, is the lifeline of a community.

1221
01:50:13,327 --> 01:50:18,910
And talk about issues that impact quality of life of each and every resident, it's zoning.

1222
01:50:19,771 --> 01:50:21,532
And, you know, it hasn't been reviewed in a while,

1223
01:50:21,872 --> 01:50:31,818
And I think Councilor Felco, when he brought up the suggestion a while back to bring someone on board, I think was an admirable suggestion to bring that up and receive guidance.

1224
01:50:32,559 --> 01:50:34,020
I've been on the council a number of years.

1225
01:50:34,340 --> 01:50:36,161
I don't claim to be a zoning expert.

1226
01:50:36,962 --> 01:50:40,904
It's very intricate and there's a lot of moving parts when it comes to zoning.

1227
01:50:41,545 --> 01:50:51,071
And I think it's only appropriate that we receive guidance from someone that is an expert when we go over the hundreds of zoning pages

1228
01:50:51,433 --> 01:50:54,415
and this community that haven't been looked at in over 30 years.

1229
01:50:54,896 --> 01:51:08,526
It's a very important role of this council, and I just would hate to see it wind up in a subcommittee that is probably going to end up spinning their wheels, and I'd rather see a full-blown meeting of the council.

1230
01:51:08,986 --> 01:51:12,188
And we can get some direction from the administration, but don't lose sight.

1231
01:51:12,889 --> 01:51:15,051
This isn't a council prerogative.

1232
01:51:15,791 --> 01:51:16,792
This is a council

1233
01:51:17,174 --> 01:51:17,714
prerogative.

1234
01:51:17,754 --> 01:51:20,855
So, we can get insight what the mayor would like to see, but guess what?

1235
01:51:21,215 --> 01:51:22,096
It's this body.

1236
01:51:22,496 --> 01:51:29,498
We have to put on our big boy pants, this council, and stand up and say, this is the direction this council would like to see.

1237
01:51:29,538 --> 01:51:38,220
We've all been around a number of years, and I think we all have ideas on what we'd like to see happen in this community and how we'd like to move forward in this community.

1238
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:46,943
So, let's not sit back and say we want to, you know, just rely on the administration because, in my opinion, Mr. President,

1239
01:51:47,296 --> 01:51:49,477
It has to arrive with this council.

1240
01:51:49,497 --> 01:51:50,138
Mr. President.

1241
01:51:50,838 --> 01:51:51,258
Thank you.

1242
01:51:51,278 --> 01:51:55,321
Counsel X name and address of the record, please.

1243
01:51:57,042 --> 01:51:58,123
Hi, I'm shower Rodriguez.

1244
01:51:58,183 --> 01:51:59,483
I live at 281 Park street.

1245
01:52:00,204 --> 01:52:00,244
Um,

1246
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:03,882
Variances are a very interesting thing in the city of Medford.

1247
01:52:04,222 --> 01:52:12,008
Anyone who's tried to add a deck, a shed, or anything onto their house knows that it can be quite expensive to get a variance, quite timely, and oftentimes you're refused.

1248
01:52:12,788 --> 01:52:17,772
But what I've noticed in the trend of attending meetings for the past seven months is that if you're a developer,

1249
01:52:18,444 --> 01:52:29,548
and you want to come in and change the entire shape of a property and build something completely different, tear down a supermarket and put 490 units, that project will glide through fairly easy.

1250
01:52:30,189 --> 01:52:31,769
And that's not right.

1251
01:52:32,009 --> 01:52:34,190
Variances are supposed to be very difficult to get.

1252
01:52:34,571 --> 01:52:38,252
There's supposed to be a demonstrated hardship before variance is granted.

1253
01:52:38,672 --> 01:52:39,853
You're not just supposed to say,

1254
01:52:40,833 --> 01:52:43,295
Well, I'll make less money if I don't do it this way.

1255
01:52:43,335 --> 01:52:44,356
That's not a hardship.

1256
01:52:44,636 --> 01:52:46,937
That's not how a variance is supposed to be granted.

1257
01:52:47,638 --> 01:53:01,267
These variances are flying out right now on Salem Street where we're looking at break pro is going to be turned and they want to build two floors over over what they're allowed to build and their reason for it is because they want to make more money.

1258
01:53:02,048 --> 01:53:06,671
There's no reason that there's a problem with the property that they need to build higher.

1259
01:53:07,128 --> 01:53:08,329
They just want variances.

1260
01:53:08,609 --> 01:53:09,870
It's not just use variances.

1261
01:53:09,930 --> 01:53:10,951
It's lots of variances.

1262
01:53:11,411 --> 01:53:15,394
If you go to the planning meetings for the square, you'll hear, we want mixed use.

1263
01:53:15,915 --> 01:53:17,296
We want lots of residential.

1264
01:53:17,336 --> 01:53:18,997
They want to change the use of the square.

1265
01:53:19,418 --> 01:53:24,622
But if you hear the people when they invite us and ask us what we want, we're not asking for that.

1266
01:53:25,302 --> 01:53:29,465
We're not saying, well, what we really need is, you know, 2,000 more students in our schools.

1267
01:53:30,226 --> 01:53:34,488
You know, the second grade at the Roberts was closed this year because the class sizes reached 25.

1268
01:53:35,128 --> 01:53:45,672
The third grade has five classes, and their classes are over 20, 22, 23 per class, because the balance of the building is happening on the east side of town.

1269
01:53:46,012 --> 01:53:50,754
So any talk about zoning needs to include, is one side getting hammered?

1270
01:53:50,794 --> 01:53:55,676
Yes, we have the 200 going on Middle Six Avenue, not a small project, 200 condos.

1271
01:53:56,336 --> 01:53:57,977
We have potentially,

1272
01:53:59,250 --> 01:54:00,711
490 on Lucas Street.

1273
01:54:01,131 --> 01:54:04,332
We have 324 opening up right near Wellington.

1274
01:54:05,532 --> 01:54:08,673
All of those people will siphon into those streets.

1275
01:54:08,814 --> 01:54:10,274
They'll siphon into the Roberts.

1276
01:54:10,314 --> 01:54:12,815
They'll siphon into the McGlynn, and those schools can't take it.

1277
01:54:13,242 --> 01:54:19,985
while we look at the other side of town with class sizes of 16 and 17, and we add them together and say, oh, the average is under 20.

1278
01:54:20,625 --> 01:54:21,025
It's not.

1279
01:54:21,145 --> 01:54:23,046
We really need to look at what's happening here.

1280
01:54:23,446 --> 01:54:26,688
We also need to balance our commercial and our residential properties.

1281
01:54:27,008 --> 01:54:29,489
We can't keep turning our commercial into residential.

1282
01:54:29,829 --> 01:54:34,531
The cost of a residence is far more than the cost of commercial to our infrastructure.

1283
01:54:34,871 --> 01:54:39,773
You'll never, ever see Hallmark Health send a student to our elementary school.

1284
01:54:40,262 --> 01:54:42,463
you will definitely see that happen out of a residential.

1285
01:54:43,064 --> 01:54:50,429
So we really need to look at not only our uses, but also why are we granting variances so easily?

1286
01:54:50,969 --> 01:55:06,579
I think the only thing I saw that failed in the past seven months was the project on Salem Street and Haynes Square where he was proposing building units on top of a storefront with zero parking and said that they could use the street or stop and shop and that was turned down.

1287
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:08,901
But other projects are pushing through.

1288
01:55:10,288 --> 01:55:12,389
without concern for the neighbors around.

1289
01:55:12,929 --> 01:55:18,071
If the Salem Street project pushes through, the Roberts Elementary School schoolyard will not see the sun in the winter.

1290
01:55:19,291 --> 01:55:24,533
Because right now, their own building is four stories, and by one o'clock, there's no more sun.

1291
01:55:25,194 --> 01:55:30,796
That building will be at least one floor higher, and it will cast us into shadow by probably about 11 a.m.

1292
01:55:30,836 --> 01:55:33,037
The children will be out in recess, in shadow.

1293
01:55:36,138 --> 01:55:37,619
It's not just about what the mayor wants.

1294
01:55:37,639 --> 01:55:42,681
I think if you go out and talk to the people, you're going to find that the density is hurting some of us.

1295
01:55:44,741 --> 01:55:45,102
Thank you.

1296
01:55:45,742 --> 01:55:46,062
Thank you.

1297
01:55:46,462 --> 01:55:52,945
Councilor Longo-Khan, did you want to see this go to a subcommittee or are you looking for a vote this evening?

1298
01:55:53,285 --> 01:55:55,646
I'm looking for a vote for it to go to committee of the whole.

1299
01:55:55,726 --> 01:55:58,787
So we can, we need to discuss this with the mayor.

1300
01:55:58,867 --> 01:56:00,988
Obviously you wanted to go to the intergovernmental

1301
01:56:01,643 --> 01:56:04,986
You know, I'd like this to go to committee of the whole sit down with the mayor first.

1302
01:56:05,186 --> 01:56:07,047
I think that needs to be done immediately.

1303
01:56:07,067 --> 01:56:27,384
I mean, the zoning board of appeals is obviously works in conjunction with the mayor's office and they, we need to, um, one of the major council Dela Russo, the, uh, uh, zoning board of appeals is an independent board that has quasi judicial authority.

1304
01:56:27,544 --> 01:56:28,024
That's correct.

1305
01:56:28,105 --> 01:56:29,766
It does not, uh, at, uh,

1306
01:56:30,323 --> 01:56:32,244
in conjunction with anybody but itself.

1307
01:56:32,444 --> 01:56:32,884
That is correct.

1308
01:56:32,904 --> 01:56:37,267
So far as I understand, and I stand to be corrected by a reasonable authority.

1309
01:56:37,487 --> 01:56:38,307
You are correct.

1310
01:56:38,427 --> 01:56:45,551
One can reasonably assume the zoning board of appeals is the only board and commission that got a raise this past budget time.

1311
01:56:45,911 --> 01:56:47,032
And one can make their own.

1312
01:56:47,832 --> 01:56:50,154
Well, this is also a brand new board of appeals.

1313
01:56:50,214 --> 01:56:53,475
Also, it's a brand new board and we need to, we need to have a vision.

1314
01:56:53,936 --> 01:56:55,576
You know, smart growth is what we need.

1315
01:56:55,677 --> 01:56:56,957
Not highly dense.

1316
01:56:58,238 --> 01:56:58,438
Okay.

1317
01:56:58,887 --> 01:57:03,548
Well, on Councilor Longo's motion is to send this to the Council of the Whole.

1318
01:57:04,869 --> 01:57:05,249
Roll call.

1319
01:57:05,649 --> 01:57:07,029
Roll call vote has been requested.

1320
01:57:08,510 --> 01:57:09,010
As amended.

1321
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:13,811
As amended.

1322
01:57:20,513 --> 01:57:20,733
Yes.

1323
01:57:21,213 --> 01:57:22,153
Councilor Dela Rousseau.

1324
01:57:22,573 --> 01:57:22,773
Yes.

1325
01:57:23,494 --> 01:57:24,214
Councilor Falco.

1326
01:57:24,294 --> 01:57:24,434
Yes.

1327
01:57:25,054 --> 01:57:25,534
Councilor Knight.

1328
01:57:25,554 --> 01:57:25,614
Yes.

1329
01:57:27,415 --> 01:57:28,355
Councilor Longo Kern.

1330
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:28,435
Yes.

1331
01:57:28,941 --> 01:57:29,662
Vice-president Marks.

1332
01:57:29,682 --> 01:57:29,762
Yes.

1333
01:57:30,683 --> 01:57:31,443
Councilor Scott Kelly.

1334
01:57:31,563 --> 01:57:31,783
Yes.

1335
01:57:32,404 --> 01:57:33,225
President Carvio.

1336
01:57:33,425 --> 01:57:33,705
Yes.

1337
01:57:34,186 --> 01:57:35,226
What was seven in the affirmative.

1338
01:57:35,267 --> 01:57:35,727
None in there.

1339
01:57:36,087 --> 01:57:45,676
Motion's Pat motion passes 17 dash zero zero eight offered by councilor Caraviello.

1340
01:57:45,716 --> 01:57:52,982
Be it resolved that the method city council send this condolences to the family of Nicholas the Maria on his recent passing.

1341
01:57:53,562 --> 01:57:55,244
This is the Maria served our country.

1342
01:57:55,863 --> 01:57:58,805
as a Navy veteran in the Vietnam War.

1343
01:57:59,326 --> 01:58:01,828
His presence in our community will be missed.

1344
01:58:01,888 --> 01:58:06,051
And we also have one more, if we can get them both at the same time.

1345
01:58:06,071 --> 01:58:21,204
17-010, offered by Councilor Caravello, being resolved that the Memphis City Council send its condolences to the family of Mary Cecchini on her recent passing at 105 years old.

1346
01:58:22,124 --> 01:58:25,127
Mary was a lifelong resident, and Mary was also

1347
01:58:25,569 --> 01:58:28,690
our oldest living resident in the city of Medford.

1348
01:58:30,731 --> 01:58:34,752
Mary's presence in our community is going to be missed by many.

1349
01:58:35,413 --> 01:58:36,873
If we could stand for a moment of silence.

1350
01:58:45,636 --> 01:58:45,936
Thank you.

1351
01:58:52,135 --> 01:58:55,397
Motion for suspension by Vice President Marks.

1352
01:59:00,379 --> 01:59:03,261
Mr. President, the President has a question.

1353
01:59:03,641 --> 01:59:03,781
Oh, who?

1354
01:59:03,801 --> 01:59:03,941
Oh, okay.

1355
01:59:04,021 --> 01:59:04,822
While we're on the suspension.

1356
01:59:08,044 --> 01:59:08,504
Good evening.

1357
01:59:08,924 --> 01:59:09,905
Name and address for the record, please.

1358
01:59:10,105 --> 01:59:12,806
John Kostas, 56 Haynes Street.

1359
01:59:13,506 --> 01:59:14,187
Happy New Year.

1360
01:59:14,647 --> 01:59:16,348
I'm in 2017.

1361
01:59:17,689 --> 01:59:21,931
On Christmas Eve, at four o'clock, my entire street lost water.

1362
01:59:23,225 --> 01:59:26,066
The 12-inch main burst under a catch basin.

1363
01:59:26,106 --> 01:59:31,549
And it wasn't a slow trickle to a, it was an end, I put out on Facebook.

1364
01:59:33,190 --> 01:59:38,973
We called the water department, and Brian and his crew were fantastic.

1365
01:59:39,733 --> 01:59:41,534
They assessed what was going to go on.

1366
01:59:42,115 --> 01:59:43,575
We called them at 4 o'clock.

1367
01:59:44,296 --> 01:59:45,616
There was some stuff going on.

1368
01:59:45,756 --> 01:59:48,198
And by 5.30, they were digging up the street.

1369
01:59:49,286 --> 01:59:52,547
And at 9.30, we all had our water back at 9.30.

1370
01:59:53,148 --> 01:59:53,688
On Christmas Eve.

1371
01:59:53,848 --> 01:59:54,788
On Christmas Eve.

1372
01:59:55,409 --> 02:00:04,453
And I just like to publicly acknowledge the wonderful job and how much we really appreciate everything Brian and his crew did because it wasn't a great night.

1373
02:00:05,113 --> 02:00:09,195
And we were thrilled because everybody had people coming over on Christmas Day.

1374
02:00:09,235 --> 02:00:12,236
And we all kind of wondered how we're going to flush our toilets.

1375
02:00:12,936 --> 02:00:16,138
And you don't realize how much you appreciate running water.

1376
02:00:17,163 --> 02:00:18,424
until it just doesn't exist.

1377
02:00:19,285 --> 02:00:23,369
So I just want to publicly acknowledge the DPW and the Water Department for an excellent job.

1378
02:00:23,529 --> 02:00:24,430
Thank you, Mr. Carstens.

1379
02:00:24,750 --> 02:00:25,090
Thank you.

1380
02:00:25,150 --> 02:00:26,051
Yeah.

1381
02:00:26,231 --> 02:00:27,332
Joy to the world.

1382
02:00:27,432 --> 02:00:27,692
Yes.

1383
02:00:28,753 --> 02:00:29,334
Thank you very much.

1384
02:00:30,435 --> 02:00:37,281
And Mr. President, uh, while we're on the subject of water, uh, we're awaiting a committee report, subcommittee report, uh,

1385
02:00:37,755 --> 02:00:55,009
The council met in subcommittee last week on Wednesday, just before Christmas, and made a motion for approval to encourage the administration to pursue negotiations regarding a leak detection system, system-wide within the city.

1386
02:00:55,609 --> 02:01:05,237
And we can be grateful to some of the councilors who've been persistent advocates for improvement in the care of our water and sewer.

1387
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:06,270
Thank you.

1388
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:08,371
Councilor Mox has been a long time advocate of that.

1389
02:01:08,831 --> 02:01:09,551
Councilor Locren.

1390
02:01:10,652 --> 02:01:34,981
On a separate issue, if we could take a vote tonight and request that we reach out to City Clerk just reaches out to the Chamber of Commerce to start discussion with regards to, I know a number of communities are banning plastic bags and I don't know if any of the other councils have got emails and phone calls with requests of asking us what we're going to do.

1391
02:01:35,586 --> 02:01:44,792
I think maybe some conversation needs to start at least at the beginning, see what the chamber thinks, see if they can reach out to their members about banning plastic bags.

1392
02:01:44,872 --> 02:02:01,342
I know Cambridge does it and I know there's a few other communities that are really looking at doing it and I think Medford needs to start inquiring and reaching out before we come across just taking a vote on it, see how the chamber feels and see how the businesses feel about this.

1393
02:02:01,402 --> 02:02:02,563
They may hate it, they may love it.

1394
02:02:02,977 --> 02:02:04,677
It's obviously great for the environment.

1395
02:02:04,837 --> 02:02:09,018
I know you can still purchase bags for 10 cents at most Cambridge shops.

1396
02:02:09,558 --> 02:02:12,739
So it is just something that's been on my radar to question.

1397
02:02:12,779 --> 02:02:30,063
And I think tonight will be a fine night to just see if we can get an email out to the Chamber of Commerce to start the dialogue, see if they can discuss it at one of their next meetings and reach out to their membership to figure out what the suggestions would be and what the impact would be.

1398
02:02:30,703 --> 02:02:32,565
The Chamber of Commerce will be meeting tomorrow night.

1399
02:02:32,725 --> 02:02:36,830
If you'd like to send Janet Donnelly an email, you could do that.

1400
02:02:37,691 --> 02:02:44,840
I would advise as City Council Member and on the Board of Directors that I shouldn't speak for the Chamber of Commerce while behind the rim.

1401
02:02:46,161 --> 02:02:51,127
If I could just take this opportunity to point out that I forget what state it is.

1402
02:02:51,689 --> 02:03:00,151
but a state legislature recently passed a law forbidding local cities and towns from prohibiting plastic bags.

1403
02:03:01,132 --> 02:03:02,292
Thank you, Councilor LaRosa.

1404
02:03:05,753 --> 02:03:07,353
On the plastic bags?

1405
02:03:08,334 --> 02:03:11,014
All in favor?

1406
02:03:23,673 --> 02:03:24,013
Present.

1407
02:03:27,735 --> 02:03:31,037
And Councilor Knight was asked to be recorded in opposition.

1408
02:03:35,580 --> 02:03:35,900
Thank you.

1409
02:03:37,001 --> 02:03:38,321
Well, Mr. Clerk, if you could send that out.

1410
02:03:41,583 --> 02:03:45,446
And 1-7-0-1-1 offered by Councilor Caravaglio.

1411
02:03:46,026 --> 02:03:52,890
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council commend and congratulate State Representative Paul Donato

1412
02:03:53,937 --> 02:04:00,122
on being the longest-serving state representative in measurement history of 16 years.

1413
02:04:01,243 --> 02:04:13,294
The representative does yeoman's work throughout our city, and I, for one, as being a friend, been a friend and a mentor to me over the years, congratulating him for all the work that he does in our community.

1414
02:04:13,934 --> 02:04:14,855
Councilor Del Rosso.

1415
02:04:14,975 --> 02:04:19,019
Mr. President, if you wouldn't mind, I motion approval of this on your behalf.

1416
02:04:19,399 --> 02:04:19,760
Thank you.

1417
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,341
And I must say that

1418
02:04:21,929 --> 02:04:30,797
My first encounter with Paul Donato was when I was a young lad distributing literature on the campaign route to my father.

1419
02:04:31,458 --> 02:04:35,802
And Paul Donato was putting out his own literature as he ran for school committee.

1420
02:04:36,377 --> 02:04:38,438
And got on, and I've known him ever since.

1421
02:04:39,719 --> 02:04:49,024
A great legislative leader, so much so that obviously he's been raised to leadership position in the state house underneath Speaker DeLeo.

1422
02:04:49,665 --> 02:04:55,588
And people of Medford can be grateful every day to have such a fine advocate working on their behalf.

1423
02:04:55,708 --> 02:04:56,769
You are correct.

1424
02:04:56,989 --> 02:05:01,872
The representative, make sure that Medford gets more than its fair share of the state funds.

1425
02:05:01,932 --> 02:05:02,492
Counselor Knight.

1426
02:05:03,153 --> 02:05:08,698
Uh, Mr. President, over the last 16 years, the representative has brought home the bacon per se, uh, to this district.

1427
02:05:08,718 --> 02:05:11,781
He's done a great job delivering for his constituency here in the city of Medford.

1428
02:05:12,261 --> 02:05:17,866
And, um, I just want to thank him for his hard work and wish him a good health and, uh, hopefully another 16 years.

1429
02:05:18,326 --> 02:05:18,687
Thank you.

1430
02:05:19,668 --> 02:05:20,368
Councilor Falco.

1431
02:05:20,648 --> 02:05:21,589
Thank you, Mr. President.

1432
02:05:21,609 --> 02:05:28,155
I also like to thank, uh, Paul for his hard work, uh, as our state representative, he's done a fine job and he's, uh,

1433
02:05:29,048 --> 02:05:33,689
He's always been known as the, you know, you give him a call, you get a call back, and he's always been there.

1434
02:05:33,769 --> 02:05:41,612
He's always been there for the city in every capacity he's served in, and he's done a great job, so congratulations to Paul and his years of service.

1435
02:05:41,632 --> 02:05:42,412
Thank you.

1436
02:05:42,432 --> 02:05:43,112
Councilor Scott Pelli.

1437
02:05:43,573 --> 02:05:43,953
Hi, too.

1438
02:05:44,233 --> 02:05:57,657
I would like to share my congratulations to Representative Donato, and I know that he has been used as a role model for, I think, everyone behind this reel, one way or another, so we appreciate everything he's done for our community,

1439
02:05:58,296 --> 02:06:04,361
We hope he continues for another 16 years and delivers more goods to our fair city.

1440
02:06:04,421 --> 02:06:04,781
Thank you.

1441
02:06:04,981 --> 02:06:05,362
Thank you.

1442
02:06:06,162 --> 02:06:08,044
Councilor Longo, currently.

1443
02:06:08,824 --> 02:06:09,245
Be brief.

1444
02:06:09,285 --> 02:06:10,766
Thank you, President Carviello.

1445
02:06:10,846 --> 02:06:16,270
I too want to thank Representative Donato for all his hard work and advocacy for the city of Medford.

1446
02:06:16,371 --> 02:06:17,652
It doesn't go unnoticed.

1447
02:06:19,433 --> 02:06:19,733
Thank you.

1448
02:06:20,194 --> 02:06:22,796
And Councilor Max.

1449
02:06:24,035 --> 02:06:24,915
Thank you, Mr. President.

1450
02:06:25,195 --> 02:06:26,676
Are we asking to give him a citation?

1451
02:06:26,696 --> 02:06:27,356
Is that what we're doing?

1452
02:06:27,376 --> 02:06:36,238
I would like to have the representative come up here in the near future and receive a citation from our distinguished party.

1453
02:06:36,338 --> 02:06:38,559
So what do we do if he stays another term, 17, 18 years?

1454
02:06:38,579 --> 02:06:41,120
Give him another citation then?

1455
02:06:41,380 --> 02:06:42,800
Give him another citation.

1456
02:06:42,820 --> 02:06:43,620
Give him another citation.

1457
02:06:44,060 --> 02:06:49,742
If we can get the representative up here in the next few weeks to give him a citation, it would be nice.

1458
02:06:50,442 --> 02:06:53,483
Mr. President, I'd be remiss too if I didn't say a few words about

1459
02:06:54,077 --> 02:06:55,038
Representative Donato.

1460
02:06:55,678 --> 02:07:09,610
Uh, here's a, here's a man that, uh, served in many capacities, the member of the school committee, member of the city council, uh, as, uh, acting, uh, actually not acting as mayor under the old city charter and now, uh, as state representative.

1461
02:07:10,051 --> 02:07:14,915
So he served in a number of capacities in this community and, uh, with distinction.

1462
02:07:15,355 --> 02:07:16,456
So I wish him well and,

1463
02:07:17,464 --> 02:07:39,314
It almost sounds like he's leaving, but he's saying he's staying so he's saying I wanted to thank him for his years of service Thank you Name address for the record sir Thank You cast Castaneda Andrew Cushin Street, Method, Mass I would also thank council representative Paul judge and to not oh also for a

1464
02:07:39,732 --> 02:07:48,276
his longevity and all his good work he's done for the local peoples, even going back to the Chevalier Auditorium and getting those seats installed and things of that nature.

1465
02:07:48,776 --> 02:07:52,998
I also would be remiss not to thank him for my birthday cards.

1466
02:07:58,801 --> 02:07:59,601
All those in favor?

1467
02:08:00,362 --> 02:08:01,983
Aye.

1468
02:08:02,803 --> 02:08:03,683
Four under suspension.

1469
02:08:04,044 --> 02:08:04,264
Yes.

1470
02:08:04,984 --> 02:08:06,865
Can we take paper off the table?

1471
02:08:08,220 --> 02:08:10,081
eligible for its third reading, 16-804.

1472
02:08:11,602 --> 02:08:21,627
Yes, 16-804, grant $250,000 and appropriate $550,000 for the reconstruction of Riverside Plaza.

1473
02:08:22,327 --> 02:08:24,829
And this will be its third reading.

1474
02:08:25,329 --> 02:08:26,830
Mr. Clerk, if you can call the roll.

1475
02:08:26,950 --> 02:08:27,590
Move approval.

1476
02:08:27,610 --> 02:08:29,891
Mr. President.

1477
02:08:29,911 --> 02:08:31,372
Councilor Marks.

1478
02:08:31,392 --> 02:08:37,135
Mr. President, I just want to go on record and be consistent with my vote that I do not support the funding mechanism

1479
02:08:37,656 --> 02:08:51,742
of the $250,000 grant because it opens this city up to creating parkland in the middle of Meffitt Square with a number of restrictions at a time when we're trying to revitalize our downtown business district.

1480
02:08:52,162 --> 02:09:03,127
So for that reason, Mr. President, I do not support the $250,000 grant, although I do support the project and it was my council resolution, Mr. President, that led to this

1481
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:09,182
uh, redoing, uh, and reuse of, uh, the bus shelter on Riverside Avenue.

1482
02:09:09,202 --> 02:09:10,242
You are correct.

1483
02:09:10,302 --> 02:09:11,803
Motion for approval, Mr. President.

1484
02:09:11,823 --> 02:09:13,744
Motion for approval by Councilor DelaRusso.

1485
02:09:13,864 --> 02:09:14,384
Mr. President.

1486
02:09:17,785 --> 02:09:21,267
Um, well, it sounds like it's a great idea.

1487
02:09:21,627 --> 02:09:29,049
I mean, for the city to go out of its way to get this grant, to put a piece of parkland in a position where you could probably do something else.

1488
02:09:29,730 --> 02:09:30,410
I just don't know.

1489
02:09:30,935 --> 02:09:36,136
You know, the part that seems to be very disturbing, they can go out of their way to find money, whether it be for this park land.

1490
02:09:36,636 --> 02:09:40,577
And this past week, an application went in for the Meffitt Public Library, which is all good.

1491
02:09:40,597 --> 02:09:41,517
These are all good causes.

1492
02:09:42,058 --> 02:09:44,498
But you have a Meffitt police station that's completely coming apart.

1493
02:09:45,979 --> 02:09:47,099
It's lost its value.

1494
02:09:47,139 --> 02:09:54,341
You go back to 2009, Councilman Marks brought forward a complaint from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts saying that the building was unfit for its habitation.

1495
02:09:54,961 --> 02:09:56,001
The city did nothing on it.

1496
02:09:56,041 --> 02:09:57,301
The city refused to condemn it.

1497
02:09:57,681 --> 02:09:59,082
And it's in a state of disrepair.

1498
02:09:59,522 --> 02:10:00,602
There is nothing going on.

1499
02:10:01,245 --> 02:10:10,935
And you try to explain this to the people in the city of Medford, you're spending $250,000, almost $500,000 to rehabilitate a place in Medford Square that you would have to leave like that ad infinitum.

1500
02:10:12,737 --> 02:10:13,918
It just doesn't make any sense.

1501
02:10:13,958 --> 02:10:20,865
It doesn't relate to not only development of Medford Square, it just doesn't relate to spending your money in the right way.

1502
02:10:21,446 --> 02:10:23,208
There are so many things that need to take place.

1503
02:10:24,372 --> 02:10:25,112
And I just don't know.

1504
02:10:25,132 --> 02:10:30,713
And I think today, most recently, the administration just hired another assistant in one of the departments.

1505
02:10:31,193 --> 02:10:41,636
You know, it would be nice if you folks and ladies, you know, were advised as to what's going on when the hiring takes place here and to have some kind of an opportunity to really need all these people at these expensive salaries.

1506
02:10:42,636 --> 02:10:48,417
You know, you just got through, unfortunately, insulting the kids from the vocational school, not you as a counselor, but the city administration.

1507
02:10:48,985 --> 02:11:11,977
by trying to hide and not use the Christmas gifts of building these things that they had around here for City Hall, and then you go put them down at Hormel Stadium, and the city administration says we're gonna have another dedicating ceremony for which never took place for that, but you're standing here, but you're standing here as it relates to spending $250,000 and accepting a grant that you'll have no control over the use of the property.

1508
02:11:12,497 --> 02:11:13,858
It makes absolutely no sense at all.

1509
02:11:14,238 --> 02:11:16,059
So I agree with you, Councilman Marks.

1510
02:11:16,159 --> 02:11:18,560
It was your idea in the beginning just to refurbish it,

1511
02:11:18,952 --> 02:11:26,737
But for that kind of money, try to explain that to the guy in the street who's trying to save money to buy a new refrigerator or a washing machine and do some upgrading in his house.

1512
02:11:27,198 --> 02:11:28,018
Move the question Mr. President.

1513
02:11:28,058 --> 02:11:33,242
The city should change its priorities as it relates to how they want to spend their development money and for its future.

1514
02:11:33,262 --> 02:11:34,143
Thank you, Councilman.

1515
02:11:36,044 --> 02:11:37,705
Name and address, record please.

1516
02:11:38,666 --> 02:11:40,747
Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, Bedford, Mass.

1517
02:11:41,588 --> 02:11:41,708
Um,

1518
02:11:42,127 --> 02:11:47,312
This Riverside Plaza project, it seems to me that it's money that's not being well spent.

1519
02:11:47,352 --> 02:11:55,679
If you go through a spending 250,000 or, or 350,000, however it works out whenever you get the grant money, et cetera.

1520
02:11:56,180 --> 02:11:57,601
I took a real close look at it.

1521
02:11:57,741 --> 02:12:01,985
I'm kind of old school and it seems to me it's an fine,

1522
02:12:05,525 --> 02:12:09,427
I'll stand in order as far as the strength of the structure.

1523
02:12:09,447 --> 02:12:11,608
It does need a roof, obviously.

1524
02:12:12,188 --> 02:12:19,691
And if it was me, what I would do, I would put a new roof on it, and that shouldn't cost more than $2,000.

1525
02:12:21,292 --> 02:12:34,097
And I would, let's say, a weather vane, maybe someone could donate it from one of their estates from the old days, in the clipper ship building days, and I would

1526
02:12:34,636 --> 02:12:56,608
probably a 25 to 55 foot high, a sculptor of sorts, metal with the wind, and I would put it three steps higher towards, next to the old cemetery.

1527
02:12:57,529 --> 02:12:58,669
That's what I would do.

1528
02:12:58,770 --> 02:13:02,492
That shouldn't cost more than, depending on how much the artist wants,

1529
02:13:04,588 --> 02:13:05,909
25,000 total.

1530
02:13:07,511 --> 02:13:12,595
And we have no so-called handcuff limits in the future with that property that way.

1531
02:13:13,355 --> 02:13:14,256
Just thinking out loud.

1532
02:13:14,296 --> 02:13:15,097
Thank you for listening.

1533
02:13:15,357 --> 02:13:16,718
Thank you for your opinion, Mr. Castaneda.

1534
02:13:18,139 --> 02:13:19,200
Name and address for the record, please.

1535
02:13:19,641 --> 02:13:21,842
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez 281 Park Street.

1536
02:13:22,603 --> 02:13:29,529
This project sounds exactly like the type of project that we were discussing last year when the election, when we passed the CPA.

1537
02:13:30,583 --> 02:13:40,990
This was supposed to be so that we wouldn't have to take money out of the general funds and put off things that the city needed because we had this special account that was just for projects like this.

1538
02:13:42,171 --> 02:13:47,054
And a year later, we're still waiting on that CPA ordinance and we're still waiting on that commission to be drafted.

1539
02:13:47,114 --> 02:13:48,075
It has been drafted.

1540
02:13:48,515 --> 02:13:50,036
It's been drafted in the past.

1541
02:13:51,953 --> 02:13:53,474
OK, and we're waiting on the commission.

1542
02:13:53,594 --> 02:13:56,535
And this project shouldn't take a dollar out of our general money.

1543
02:13:56,555 --> 02:13:58,275
It should come right out of the CPA funds.

1544
02:13:58,775 --> 02:14:00,296
We've already paid those funds in.

1545
02:14:01,116 --> 02:14:05,458
And if this is the project that we want to spend the money on, then that's where the money should come.

1546
02:14:05,838 --> 02:14:07,898
We have to be leery of some of these grants.

1547
02:14:08,039 --> 02:14:13,340
I do apply for grants as part of my PTO at my daughter's elementary school.

1548
02:14:13,400 --> 02:14:20,183
And I've seen grants that look great and say, we're going to give you $60,000, and you can put new playground equipment on your school.

1549
02:14:21,163 --> 02:14:25,585
But you have to provide $150,000 for surfacing and leveling.

1550
02:14:25,625 --> 02:14:28,327
And then I say, whoa, we can't do that because we don't have that kind of money.

1551
02:14:29,287 --> 02:14:30,828
That's something that we need to look at here.

1552
02:14:30,888 --> 02:14:32,709
Grants are great, but we can't afford all of them.

1553
02:14:32,889 --> 02:14:34,130
And we have to be choosy.

1554
02:14:34,530 --> 02:14:39,492
And if we have a fund that's sitting there ripe for projects like this, then that's something we should tap into.

1555
02:14:39,572 --> 02:14:42,334
Is that something that we can retroactively tap into here?

1556
02:14:42,694 --> 02:14:45,916
Or is that just money that's going to come out of the general fund and it's just gone?

1557
02:14:47,457 --> 02:14:47,737
Thank you.

1558
02:14:47,777 --> 02:14:48,037
Thank you.

1559
02:14:50,854 --> 02:14:52,095
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1560
02:14:52,395 --> 02:14:58,060
The Community Preservation Act has a requirement that a Community Preservation Commission will be established.

1561
02:14:58,100 --> 02:15:06,526
And the Community Preservation Commission is the capital planning body and the body that would come up with where that funding is going to be spent and where it's going to be appropriated.

1562
02:15:07,947 --> 02:15:08,688
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1563
02:15:09,829 --> 02:15:10,890
Name and address of the record, please.

1564
02:15:10,910 --> 02:15:12,411
With approval of the council.

1565
02:15:21,849 --> 02:15:22,769
Name and address of the record.

1566
02:15:23,810 --> 02:15:24,931
Gene Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

1567
02:15:24,971 --> 02:15:26,151
Thank you very much.

1568
02:15:26,191 --> 02:15:30,813
First of all, I want to thank the mayor and commend her for doing, for looking at Medford Square.

1569
02:15:31,754 --> 02:15:36,116
I think it's fantastic because Medford Square, the traffic pattern is an absolute nightmare.

1570
02:15:36,536 --> 02:15:40,358
So I want to thank her for putting that as a top priority for the city.

1571
02:15:40,838 --> 02:15:43,959
I think it's great and worthy and fantastic.

1572
02:15:44,080 --> 02:15:44,860
I mean, it's absolutely

1573
02:15:45,413 --> 02:15:48,334
It's got to be the number one thing, because it's a mess.

1574
02:15:48,714 --> 02:15:52,275
And we want people to come here, and we want them to enjoy the square.

1575
02:15:53,115 --> 02:16:00,777
That said, I'm grateful for the library.

1576
02:16:01,118 --> 02:16:02,458
I'm going to compliment her on the library.

1577
02:16:02,478 --> 02:16:03,138
Whoever got that done.

1578
02:16:03,178 --> 02:16:04,358
The library has nothing to do with this.

1579
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:04,799
Right.

1580
02:16:04,979 --> 02:16:06,659
But whoever got that done, fantastic.

1581
02:16:07,439 --> 02:16:08,260
The library isn't done.

1582
02:16:09,280 --> 02:16:10,040
It's not a done deal?

1583
02:16:10,100 --> 02:16:10,840
It's not a done deal.

1584
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:12,721
It's just an application.

1585
02:16:13,872 --> 02:16:16,975
Well, I wish it all well because I'm a proponent of the library.

1586
02:16:17,235 --> 02:16:22,219
But anyway, the problem is that the drip, drip, drip of small amounts of money.

1587
02:16:22,539 --> 02:16:24,901
And I don't know if we're borrowing money.

1588
02:16:25,121 --> 02:16:28,304
Are we borrowing the $250,000 to pay for this?

1589
02:16:30,225 --> 02:16:30,946
We're borrowing.

1590
02:16:30,986 --> 02:16:33,568
So we're going to be doing one of those bonds, right?

1591
02:16:34,068 --> 02:16:34,329
Oh, no.

1592
02:16:34,429 --> 02:16:35,429
So you see that can't happen.

1593
02:16:35,830 --> 02:16:43,476
The problem with that, and with all due respect, is that we need to prioritize the police department first.

1594
02:16:43,920 --> 02:16:47,342
And the problem with this money has nothing to do with the police department either.

1595
02:16:48,022 --> 02:16:50,423
Yeah, but it all adds up to this money.

1596
02:16:50,463 --> 02:16:52,524
This money has nothing to do with the police departments.

1597
02:16:53,364 --> 02:16:57,386
You can't take this money and put it to this grant money and use it for the police department.

1598
02:16:57,426 --> 02:16:58,066
Not the grant money.

1599
02:16:58,106 --> 02:16:59,367
No, but the bond money.

1600
02:16:59,947 --> 02:17:01,588
See, it's a small project.

1601
02:17:01,608 --> 02:17:03,088
There's no such thing.

1602
02:17:03,108 --> 02:17:04,009
Councilor Longo Kern.

1603
02:17:04,869 --> 02:17:13,753
We're going out to bond 550, but the council did take a vote that once we get reimbursed that 250, it will go directly towards paying off the portion of the bond.

1604
02:17:14,713 --> 02:17:16,195
But we are taking out a bond to do it.

1605
02:17:16,655 --> 02:17:17,436
We're taking out a bond.

1606
02:17:17,456 --> 02:17:18,697
We're going to reimburse it but only 250.

1607
02:17:18,737 --> 02:17:21,721
So yes, the city is in it for 300.

1608
02:17:22,321 --> 02:17:23,643
With all due respect and I get that.

1609
02:17:24,203 --> 02:17:28,027
But we're still borrowing money for a small project that's not necessary for the city.

1610
02:17:28,348 --> 02:17:29,229
It's a nice project.

1611
02:17:29,549 --> 02:17:34,975
The other point that I would like to make is that I like the idea of doing the city square.

1612
02:17:36,711 --> 02:17:41,693
Instead of just doing it drip by drip by drip, we need to have a master plan for the thing.

1613
02:17:41,993 --> 02:17:44,334
And if we don't get a grant, then we don't get a grant for it.

1614
02:17:44,694 --> 02:17:52,237
Because we have to have the whole city, the square process, like in, you know, and then if we can get a grant for it, fantastic.

1615
02:17:52,537 --> 02:17:53,738
But it has to be straightened out.

1616
02:17:54,798 --> 02:17:58,343
without thinking that, you know, Daddy Warbucks is going to give us money.

1617
02:17:58,543 --> 02:18:12,082
And I know it's great when he does that, but it's, you know, I would just warn us that if we keep on doing small little grants and grants and grants, we'll never get to the priorities because we have schools to pay for and repairs and

1618
02:18:12,533 --> 02:18:15,774
maintenance and police department personnel and everything else.

1619
02:18:15,834 --> 02:18:18,515
And so every little bit matters.

1620
02:18:18,595 --> 02:18:21,816
But, um, so I don't want to be a, I really don't want to be a fly in the ointment.

1621
02:18:22,136 --> 02:18:23,096
I was having a great night.

1622
02:18:23,257 --> 02:18:27,818
I wasn't going to get up and talk, but, but I can't help myself.

1623
02:18:28,098 --> 02:18:28,818
So thank you very much.

1624
02:18:28,838 --> 02:18:32,780
This is a built, this is a building block for the redevelopment of the square.

1625
02:18:32,820 --> 02:18:35,661
Move the question, Mr. President.

1626
02:18:35,881 --> 02:18:36,281
Thank you.

1627
02:18:36,461 --> 02:18:39,462
Um, president Carviello, I just want to reiterate, I think,

1628
02:18:40,372 --> 02:18:44,215
The last few speakers are making an extremely important point.

1629
02:18:44,335 --> 02:18:50,941
And I think as one counselor, I would rather be voting for a new police station or bonding for a new police station.

1630
02:18:51,241 --> 02:18:55,345
But that was not what has been put forward to us by the administration.

1631
02:18:55,865 --> 02:18:57,526
This is a worthwhile project.

1632
02:18:57,607 --> 02:18:59,068
It's great that we're getting grant money.

1633
02:18:59,248 --> 02:19:00,249
It is a little pricey.

1634
02:19:00,349 --> 02:19:01,149
I agree with that.

1635
02:19:01,490 --> 02:19:05,293
It was what was put before us, not being allowed to make

1636
02:19:05,822 --> 02:19:09,805
changes financially to the concept is difficult.

1637
02:19:09,905 --> 02:19:12,386
I think it's a hard decision we have to make.

1638
02:19:13,147 --> 02:19:17,450
But it's something, with regards to the police station, it is all relevant.

1639
02:19:17,530 --> 02:19:20,292
We need to go out to bond for a new police station.

1640
02:19:20,332 --> 02:19:23,954
We need to do it sooner than proposed in the capital improvement plan.

1641
02:19:24,234 --> 02:19:34,581
But until we have five counselors that will bond together and demand that, it's not going to happen until the administration is ready.

1642
02:19:34,874 --> 02:19:37,336
And we've said loud and clear, that is our priority.

1643
02:19:37,636 --> 02:19:38,477
It is our priority.

1644
02:19:38,517 --> 02:19:40,599
So we're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place.

1645
02:19:40,999 --> 02:19:45,823
Do we not vote for any of these projects and then not move the city forward, waiting for that?

1646
02:19:45,963 --> 02:19:50,106
Or do we just continually keep asking for it and keep almost begging for it?

1647
02:19:51,367 --> 02:19:53,549
With all due respect, it's going to sound like terrible.

1648
02:19:53,889 --> 02:19:56,551
But the little thing that you're talking about is a luxury.

1649
02:19:56,811 --> 02:19:59,433
It's like a thing for people to come and gather.

1650
02:19:59,453 --> 02:20:02,736
And with the things that this- It's the start of a building

1651
02:20:03,163 --> 02:20:04,424
the rebuilding of the squares.

1652
02:20:04,444 --> 02:20:06,006
It's a starting point.

1653
02:20:06,827 --> 02:20:07,668
You have to start somewhere.

1654
02:20:08,408 --> 02:20:09,970
Yeah, but we have to have a master plan.

1655
02:20:10,010 --> 02:20:12,432
You may not agree, but it is a starting point.

1656
02:20:12,753 --> 02:20:14,515
Move the question, Mr. President.

1657
02:20:16,056 --> 02:20:16,396
Thank you.

1658
02:20:17,678 --> 02:20:18,238
Just one point.

1659
02:20:18,278 --> 02:20:19,820
Maybe I misunderstood something.

1660
02:20:20,338 --> 02:20:23,640
Did you just say that this is the beginning of the starting of the building of the square?

1661
02:20:24,200 --> 02:20:25,361
It's a starting point.

1662
02:20:25,441 --> 02:20:26,461
Where's the report on that?

1663
02:20:26,521 --> 02:20:27,442
And who presented that?

1664
02:20:27,542 --> 02:20:28,342
And where is it?

1665
02:20:29,263 --> 02:20:29,963
It's no one presented.

1666
02:20:29,983 --> 02:20:31,123
It's a starting point.

1667
02:20:31,184 --> 02:20:32,164
Who said it's the starting point?

1668
02:20:32,184 --> 02:20:33,885
I said it's the starting point.

1669
02:20:33,985 --> 02:20:36,206
So don't let's mislead the people by saying it's the starting point.

1670
02:20:36,246 --> 02:20:37,107
That is a misleading.

1671
02:20:37,387 --> 02:20:38,067
It is a misleading.

1672
02:20:38,087 --> 02:20:39,788
It's a starting point for the rebuilding of the square.

1673
02:20:40,428 --> 02:20:47,451
The starting point of the building in the square is those poor businesses that are being affected by a bridge that's got another year and a half to go over there, okay?

1674
02:20:47,631 --> 02:20:48,752
And they can't get the right of day.

1675
02:20:48,972 --> 02:20:54,974
And no one from this city, hall, has gone down to any one of those businesses and asked them, how is their business, how has it been affected?

1676
02:20:55,194 --> 02:20:57,375
They have a bus stop issue they can't even get resolved.

1677
02:20:57,696 --> 02:21:02,518
And you're talking about taking $250,000 and putting it on a piece of property.

1678
02:21:02,558 --> 02:21:05,139
Many people have gone down and addressed the business.

1679
02:21:05,159 --> 02:21:05,799
No, they haven't.

1680
02:21:05,859 --> 02:21:07,940
No one from this building has gone down there.

1681
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:10,281
No, I think you go out and go talk to the people.

1682
02:21:11,001 --> 02:21:16,423
More importantly, more importantly, Mr. President, you're making this a permanent piece of property that you cannot touch.

1683
02:21:17,123 --> 02:21:19,604
And if you cannot touch it, what's the sense of taking it?

1684
02:21:19,624 --> 02:21:20,585
You're being restricted.

1685
02:21:20,885 --> 02:21:25,406
And if you're being restricted, you council Longo current, you said it's an expensive.

1686
02:21:26,447 --> 02:21:34,050
In the past several months, we've seen a number of resolutions come across the city council, uh, agenda that had been voted on favorably by these bodies.

1687
02:21:34,090 --> 02:21:34,910
Mr. President, um,

1688
02:21:35,250 --> 02:21:40,233
that speak to directed patrols down in Memphis square due to an increased amount of loitering.

1689
02:21:40,453 --> 02:21:45,035
Um, uh, I believe the term was undesirables hanging around the square.

1690
02:21:45,176 --> 02:21:50,338
Um, it was used a couple of times, but quite frankly, um, we don't have any right to tell somebody who's standing in public property.

1691
02:21:50,639 --> 02:21:51,999
That's not a park land to beat it.

1692
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:55,101
When it becomes a park, it falls into the jurisdiction of the park commission.

1693
02:21:55,321 --> 02:21:57,663
We have more control and direction over what happens in that piece of land.

1694
02:21:57,683 --> 02:22:02,085
And right now the park, if I understand it correctly, and I can be corrected,

1695
02:22:02,351 --> 02:22:03,171
It's in perpetuity.

1696
02:22:03,211 --> 02:22:04,852
Councilor Lingo-Curran, she's the lawyer.

1697
02:22:04,892 --> 02:22:06,993
Perpetuity means it stays the way it is.

1698
02:22:07,013 --> 02:22:08,173
I understand that.

1699
02:22:08,253 --> 02:22:10,114
I understand that.

1700
02:22:10,234 --> 02:22:11,735
What is your rush, Councilor De La Rosa?

1701
02:22:11,755 --> 02:22:12,635
You want to get home early?

1702
02:22:12,675 --> 02:22:14,776
You have a customer waiting for you?

1703
02:22:15,356 --> 02:22:16,776
Listen, I would like to make my point.

1704
02:22:16,796 --> 02:22:18,757
This is very important.

1705
02:22:18,997 --> 02:22:23,179
You're taking city money to match it and to get paid back on it.

1706
02:22:23,879 --> 02:22:30,001
The unfortunate part is, don't have people misled that this is the beginning of changing the revitalization of Bedford Square.

1707
02:22:30,261 --> 02:22:35,562
When you haven't even had the business people, you haven't even had the chamber come in to have a discussion on how it is.

1708
02:22:35,602 --> 02:22:36,663
We've had multiple discussions.

1709
02:22:36,703 --> 02:22:38,183
No, you haven't had multiple discussions.

1710
02:22:38,563 --> 02:22:39,623
You haven't, Mr. President.

1711
02:22:39,843 --> 02:22:42,504
And you're on the chamber and you've been there long enough and you should know.

1712
02:22:42,924 --> 02:22:44,565
I don't speak for the chamber behind the rail.

1713
02:22:46,385 --> 02:22:48,066
I do not speak for the chamber behind the rail.

1714
02:22:48,586 --> 02:22:49,326
Councilor Longo-Kirk.

1715
02:22:49,655 --> 02:22:55,196
Just on that point of imperpetuity, I think it was asked in the committee of the whole meeting, and I think it's satisfied.

1716
02:22:55,296 --> 02:22:57,257
And I understand the concern.

1717
02:22:57,297 --> 02:22:58,437
I had the concern as well.

1718
02:22:58,777 --> 02:23:01,178
And I understand why Councilor Marks is voting against it.

1719
02:23:01,258 --> 02:23:03,338
But I asked that question specifically.

1720
02:23:03,899 --> 02:23:06,179
And there's obviously a rule against perpetuity.

1721
02:23:06,279 --> 02:23:15,721
So the way it was explained to us, and I am taking that as how things would go, is that we could not, yes, that will be parkland.

1722
02:23:15,762 --> 02:23:17,642
That will be parkland for a very long time.

1723
02:23:18,046 --> 02:23:24,069
And if we try to change it in two, three, four years, especially while we're paying off that bond, then no, we're not going to be able to change that.

1724
02:23:24,409 --> 02:23:33,434
But down the line, 25, 35, 40 years down the line, whenever that may be, and whenever this council wants to change that, we may be able to do that.

1725
02:23:33,674 --> 02:23:35,095
And that's how it was explained to us.

1726
02:23:35,295 --> 02:23:35,615
Thank you.

1727
02:23:37,076 --> 02:23:38,557
On Councilor DelaRusso's motion.

1728
02:23:40,238 --> 02:23:40,578
Second.

1729
02:23:42,859 --> 02:23:44,180
Second by Councilor Layton.

1730
02:23:44,760 --> 02:23:46,101
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1731
02:23:46,988 --> 02:23:52,232
It's recording in opposition based on- Councilor Marks has been recorded in opposition based on the reasons he stated.

1732
02:23:53,313 --> 02:23:54,294
On the funding mechanism.

1733
02:23:54,314 --> 02:23:55,215
When the roll call comes.

1734
02:23:57,096 --> 02:23:57,957
Councilor Del Rosso.

02:23:58,417 --> 02:23:58,757
Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

1740
02:24:02,240 --> 02:24:02,981

Yes.

No.

1744
02:24:06,764 --> 02:24:07,644
Councilor Scott Pelli.

1745
02:24:07,744 --> 02:24:07,985
Yes.

1746
02:24:09,105 --> 02:24:09,926
President Caviello.

1747
02:24:10,186 --> 02:24:10,487
Yes.

1748
02:24:10,787 --> 02:24:13,609
In the vote of six in the affirmative, one in the negative.

1749
02:24:14,269 --> 02:24:15,070
Motion passes.

1750
02:24:15,150 --> 02:24:16,151
It's had a standard reading.

1751
02:24:18,295 --> 02:24:19,316
and it will move on.

1752
02:24:20,458 --> 02:24:20,818
Thank you.

1753
02:24:21,840 --> 02:24:24,483
Records have been passed to Councilor DelaRusso.

1754
02:24:24,924 --> 02:24:30,491
Mr. President, I wish more time to scrutinize the records and motion that they be tabled.

1755
02:24:30,971 --> 02:24:32,293
Thank you, Councilor DelaRusso.

1756
02:24:33,514 --> 02:24:35,377
Motion to adjourn by Councilor Falco.
